      <description>In Bṛhaspatismṛti, the king is told to protect the dharmas of those born of pratilomas, those residing in forts, and the dharmas of specific deśa &amp;amp; jāti. Even though, elsewhere they may be punishable, but for them they shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be so, or else they would develop aversion for the king, which&amp;rsquo;ll lead to destruction of his power and treasury. Following are some examples of dharmas given:

Many asked me about what is nitya shraadham. Typically after the demise of one&amp;rsquo;s mother or father, some are habituated to doing the 13 day ceremonies followed by the monthly maasikam/ oona maasikam.
Typically soda-kumbham is done the previous day of the maasikam. This soda-kumbham on the 12th day after sapindi-karanam is done. This soda-kumbha is what needs to be done on all days till the previous day of the prathama aabdika shraadham.</description>
