      <description>The study and practice of hindu kalpa-s is quite *addictive* and (thankfully) useful - just as some other performance arts are. Even if you discount purported supernatural benefits, many hindu rituals (with their varied mantra, tantra, svara underpinnings) are incredibly well designed.
The US army flag-hoisting ceremony and the Japanese tea ceremony are examples of very moving rituals in non-hindu contexts which may resonate with your past experience, gentle reader.</description>

      <title>Self cultivation</title>

      <description>A personal note: I enjoy chanting (especially bits of the vEda-s I know), doing Asanas, various niyta and naimittika karmas. Repeating well crafted mantra-s, until a pinnacle of mood, memory and understanding is reached, is a favorite &amp;lsquo;meditation&amp;rsquo;. Thence I enjoy benefits such as courage, steadfastness in the dharma, joy etc.
The goal Hindu self-cultivation gives one joy, satisfaction, and strength to follow and achieve the various goals of life(puruShArtha), including dharma.</description>
