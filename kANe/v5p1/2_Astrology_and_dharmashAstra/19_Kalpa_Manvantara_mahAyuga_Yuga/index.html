  <p>CHAPTER XIX</p>
<p>Kalpa, Manvantara, Mahāyug : Yuga</p>
<p>After dealing with time measures from yugn ( of five years) down to weekdays and the day one must now briefly deal with the other measures of time such as Yuga, Mahāyuga, Manvan tara and Kalpa. The word Kalpa has its germi in the Rgveda 1080 X. 190. 3, where it is said that the Creator created the Sun and the Moon, the heaven, the earth and mid&ndash;region as before.' The earliest datable reference to Kalpa is found in Aśoka&rsquo;s edicts e. g. the 4th Rock edict 1081 at Girnar and Kalsi have &lsquo;āva savata kapi&rsquo; (yāyat samvartakalpam ) and &lsquo;āva kapam&rsquo; in the 5th Rock Edict at Shahabazgarhi and Mansora. This establishes that the theories about the vast extent of Kalpa had been pro mulgated in India long before the third century BC. The Buddhists also took over the theory of Kalpas as is clear from the Mahāparinibbānasutta III 53 “ Vouchsafe, Lord, to remain during the Kalpa. Live on, O Blessed One, through the Kalpa for the good and happiness of the great multitudes &amp;c.'.</p>
<p>The beliefs that in the dim past there was an ideally perfect society followed by a gradual degeneracy and decline in standards of morals, health and length of life and that the cycle of decline would be followed in the far distant future by a golden age of perfection in morals &amp;c. have been dealt with in H. of Dh. vol. III. pp. 885 ff. The word &lsquo;yuya&rsquo; has been shown there as having probably several meanings, viz. a short period of time (Rg. III. 26.3 ), a cycle of five years and also a long period and a period of thousands of years. Prof. Mankad in Poona Orientalist ( vol. VI. pp. 211-212 ) assigns as many as ten meanings to the</p>

<li>Vide fascriptions of Asoka in C. I. I. vol. I, pp. 6, 30 (text of 4th edict), and pp. 55, 74 ( text of 5th edict). In the Vanaparva 188, 69 it is said that fire called Sadvartaka will assail the world while the Brahmapurāna (232. 39) says that terrible clouds called &ldquo;Samvartaka' will rise, when final dissolution (pralaya) will follow. Therefore, &lsquo;āva samvata kapā&rsquo; means</li>
</ol>
<p>• up to the end of Kalpa when destructive fire called samvartaka will arise' (or when terrible clouds called samvartaka will arise ). It may be noted that the Amara-kośa regards Hadi, 474, 754, 974 and 97 as synonyms.</p>

<p>word. One cannot agree with him in all that he says. For example, he appears to be wrong when he says that in Sakuntala IV (yugāntaram ārūdhaḥ savitā ) yuga means įth of a day; yuga does not, so far as I know, mean ith anywhere, it means &lsquo;four&rsquo; in some cases. In Sakuntala &lsquo;yugāntara &amp;c.&rsquo; should be taken to mean that the sun has come up in the sky as much as the length of a yoke (from the eastern horizon)'. That is the sense of &lsquo;yuga&rsquo; in Rg. X, 60.8, X. 101. 3 and 4. In the Mahābhārata, in Manu and the Purāṇas the theory of yugas, mancaniaras and kalpas has been elaborated at great length. The four yugas are named Kr̥ta, Tretā, Dvāpara and Tisya or Kali and concern only Bhārata-varsa. 1081a But it has been shown (at pp. 886-890 of the H. of Dh, vol. III.) that originally these were the names of cer tain throws of dice in gambling and that from the 4th century B.C. (if not earlier) they came to be the designations of the ages of man. The early Gupta inscriptions refer to Kitayuga as a cycle of great virtues ( as in the Bilsad stone pillar Inscription of Kumāragupta in Gupta Samvat 96 in &lsquo;Gupta Inscriptions&rsquo; p. 44, the Chammak copperplate of Vākātaka Pravarasena II in &lsquo;Gupta Inscriptions&rsquo; p. 237, Pattan plates of Pravarasena II. in E. 1. 23 p. 81. The theory of Yugas, Manvantaras and Kalpas is elaborated among ancient works in the Mahābhārata (Vana parva, chapters 149, 158 and Sāntiparya, chap. 69 and 231-232 ), Manu I. 61-74, 79-86, Viṣṇudharmasūtra chap. 20. 1-21, Vispu purāna 1.3, 6.3, Brahmapurāṇa 5. 229-232, Matsya 142-145, Vāyu chap. 21, 22, 57, 58, 100, Kūrma I. chap. 51 and 53, Brahmānda II. 6 and 31-36, III. 1, Mārkandeya 58 64, 66-70, 71-97 ( has the</p>

Similarly, 194 60.25 (or i farg), 979 f 149. 38 say that Kaliyuga was very dear when the Bbārata war was about to be fought (Garau Harraciada). On the other hand, many of the Purāṇas say that Kaliyuga began tbe very day Krsna finished bis avatāra and weat to heaven; TT 99. 428-29, TUE III. 74. 241, HET 273. 49-50, page IV, 24. 110, Tiraq XII233; 212.8 bas the same idea in different words.

<p>longest account of Manvantaras), and by astronomical writers and works such as Aryabhata, Sūryasiddhānta, Brahmagupta, Siddhantaśiromani. None of these works enables us to furnish a satisfactory explanation about the rise of this system of Kalpas, Manyantaras and Yugas. Pargiter (in AIHT p.175 ) thinks that the division into four ages had a historical basis. That may or may not be so. But what historical explanation can be offered about manvantaras and kalpas is not stated anywhere. The theory of yugas concerned only Bhāratavarṣa as stated in several Purāṇas. All these works contain the same general features but there are many divergences in details. As the Manusmr̥ti contains one of the oldest accounts, a summary of its remarks will be first set out. First, seven Manus are enume rated viz. Svāyambhuva, Svārociṣa, Uttama, Tāmasa, Raivata, Cāksuṣa and Vaivasvata. Then divisions of time from nimesa are specified ( 18 nimesa = Kāṣthā, 30 Kāṣthās = Kalā, 30 Kalās = Muhurta, 30 Muhūrtas = ahorātra ); it is then said that the human month is the day and night of putts, the human year is divine ahorālra. Kr̥ta-yuga extends over 4000 1082 years, sandhyā (twilight ) before it is 400 years, sandhyāmsa after it is 400 years. The three other yugas Tretā, Dvāpara and Kali have respectively 3000, 2000, 1000 years and sandhyās and sandhyā. mśas together of respectively 600, 400 and 200 years. The four yugas thus come to 12000 years ( 4300 plus 3600 plus 2400 plus 1200 ); this is called the yuga of gods (i. e. this is the divya measure ) and 1000 of these four come to one day of Brahmā and the same is the extent of the night of Brahmā. Seventy-one yugas of 12000 divine years each constitute a manyantara and Manu (I. 80) winds up by saying that manvantaras are numberless 1083 and so are creations and dissolutions. It should</p>

<li>It was said by Manu (1. 81-82) that Kyta was an age in which Dharma was four-footed and perfect, that in the other ages dharma declined successively by one foot, that theft, falsehood and fraud increase ia propor tion. Then Manu further avers (I. 83-86 ) that the length of human life in the four ages is respectively 400, 350. 200 and 100 years, tbat the set of duties differ in the four ages. Dharma is said to be four-footed because Manu VIII 16 identifies dharma with vrsa (buil). Both Plato and Aristotle believed that every art and science bad many times developed to its apogee and then deteriorated.</li>

<p>be noticed that the word Kalpa does not occur in this long enume ration. But in other works than the Manusmr̥ti e.g. Viṣṇupurāṇa (V1.3. 11-12) fourteen Manvantaras are said to constitute a Kalpa, which is a day of Brahmā. As a day of the gods is equal to a human year, the 12000 years that constitute a divine caturyuja are equal to 4320000 human year: 1083.4 (12000 x 360) i. e, this is the human (mā iuṣa ) measure of time.</p>
<p>When and how these huge numbers of years for the yugas were suggested remains somewhat enigmatic. It appears that as early as the Satapatha-brāhmana people had become familiar with huge figures. The Satapatha 1084 says that there are 10800 muhūrtas in a year (in one ahorātra 30 X 360), that Prajāpati arranged the Rgveda in such a way that the number of syllables it contains is equal to 12000 Brhatis ( each Brhati having 36 syllables ) i. e. 432000 syllables and it is further stated that the Rgveda also contains 10890 panktis (each pankti having 10 syllables i.e. the syllables are 10800 X 40 = 432000. Prajāpati is said to have arranged the other two Vedas also and the three Vedas amounted to ten thousand eight hundred eighties (that is 80 x 10:00 = 864000 syilables ), that muhurtu by muhurta he gained eighty syllables (as there are 10800 muhurtas in a sacrificial year of 360 days). Dr. Jean Filliozat, Professor at the College de France, Paris, puts forward the theory in a recent article (in the Bulletin</p>
<p>1083 a. Many ancient authors in almost all countries believed that there were different ages with differing levels of virtue and that they themselves lived in the worst age. Vide Hesiod&rsquo;s' Works and days &lsquo;pp. 11-17 (Loeb Classical Library) where Hesiod&rsquo;s own age was said to be the worst of five ages. The Babylonians made out 2160000 years for the duration of the world and imagined there were three ages, viz. golden, silver and copper, Vide pp, 33-34 of Maclean&rsquo;s Babylonian astrology in relation to the Old Testament&rsquo;. Sarton also thinks that the Sumeriaas originated a golden age of man and speak of huge numbers of years, viz. 12,960,000 (PP. 69 and 118 of' a History of Science'). Berossus gave a list of tea ante-deluvian kings reigning in all for 432000 years (see Cambridge Ancient History, 1923, vol. I. page 150 ). Vide Heath&rsquo;s &lsquo;Greek astronomy&rsquo; (Introduction, p. XIV) re Egyptiaas' claim for possessing records of observations of stars for 630,000 years and a similar claim of Babylonians for 1,444,000 years,</p>

Vide . Ancient relations between Indian and foreign astronomical systems' by Dr. J. Filliozat in JOR, Madras, vol. XXV ( for 1957 ) pp. 1-8; also Prof. Zinner (in &lsquo;Stars above us&rsquo; p. 59 ) for theories about the age of the world held by Plato and Berossus. One day of Brahmā is equal to a Kalpa i. e. 4320000 x 1000 i. e. 432,000,000,0. In order 1085 to find out the humanı years of the one hundred years of Brahma&rsquo;s life we shall have to multiply 32,000,0000 by 2, then by 360 and then by 100. That is, the day and night of Brahma come to 8640000000 human years; the year of Brahmā would then be equal to 3110400000000 human years ( taking 360 days as a year); one hundred years of Brahmā thus come to 311040000000000 years. Alberuni ( Sachau, vol. I p. 332 ) also mentions this colossal figure about the life of Brahmā. Somo said that the extent of Brahma&rsquo;s life was 108 years. Brahmā is said to have already lived 50 years and it is the second half of his life that is running and at present it is the Vārāba 1086 Kalpa and Vaivasvata-manvantara 1087 (7 th ) that</p>

<p>are going on. The past six Manus are Svāyambhuva, Svārocisa, Uttama, Tāmasa, Raivata, Cākṣuṣa and the present is Vaivasvata, the 7th Manu (Brahma 5. 4-5, Kūrma I. 51. 4-5, Vispu III. 1. 6–7). The remaining seven Manus are differently named in several Purāṇas e. g. Viṣṇu (III. 2. 14 ff) and Narasimhapurāna 24. 17–35 mention the future Manus as Sāvarni, Daksa Sāvarpi, Brahniasāyarpi, Dharmasāvarnika, Rudra-sāvarpi, Ruci and Bhauma; while Brahma (5. 5-6 ) mentions four of the future seven as Sāvarni, Raibhya, Raucya, Merusāvarui. Kūrma (I. 53. 30–31) names the future four in the same way as Vispu (only substituting Savarṇa for Sāvarni wherever it occurs and the last two as Raucya and Bhautya). All the fourteon Manus are enumerated in Nāradapurāna I, 40. 20–23. Alberuni (tr. by Sachau, vol. I. chap. XLIV p. 387 ) gives the names of Manvan taras according to the Viṣṇudharmottara, l&rsquo;isnupurāna and other sources. Sāvarṇya 1088 Manu as a great benefactor and leader of some territory occurs in Rg. X. 62. 11. It is said that each Manvantara had a separate set of sages, sons of Manu, gods, kings, smr̥tis, Indra and guardians for the proper regulation of dharma and for the protection of the people (Brahma 5. 39, Vispupurāna III. chapters 1-2). In the Viṣṇupurāṇa it is said that some gods remain for four yugas, some for a manvantara and some stay for a kalpa, 10887 The Viṣṇudharmasūtra (chap. XX. 1-15 ) has the same account of Manvantaras and Kalpas as Manu&rsquo;s but it adds one detail viz. that the whole ago of Brahmā is equal to a day of Purusa ( Viṣṇu) and the night of Purusa is also as long. It is remarkable that the same view is attributed by Alberuni (Sachau vol. I. p. 332 ) to the Puliśasiddhānta.

<p>except this that 12000 years are called Yuga 1089 simply and not caturyuga (as in Manu I. 71 ). The Markandeya has a long story about Svārocisa in chapters 58-65, devotes to Uttama chap. 66-70, chapter 71 to Tāmasa, chap. 72 to Raivata, chap. 73 to Caksusa, chap. 74-76 to Vaivasvata, chap. 77 to Savarni, chap. 78-90 to Devi, chap. 91-95 to Raucya or Ruci, chap. 96-97 to Bhautya. The word &lsquo;Vaivasvata &lsquo;(son of Vivasvat, the Sun) is applied to Yama in several passages of the Rgveda (X. 14. 1, X. 58. 1, X. 60. 10, X. 164.2). The Anukramani, however, ascribes Rg. VIII. 27-31 to Vaivasvata Manu as the rsi and in one of the Valakhilya hymns (Rg. X. 52. 1) occurs the following verse &lsquo;O Indra! just as you drank the soma extracted in (the sacrifice of) Manu Vivasvat, just as you frequently accept the hymn of praise in ( sacrifice of) Trita, so may you simultaneously delight in ( the soma and praise) of Ayu.&rsquo; 1023 It may be noted that the Manusmr̥ti names only the seven Manus ( I. 61-63) and states that each Manu during his own time (which extended over thousands of years ) created the movable and iramovable world and protected it, that Manvantaras are numberless ( Manusmr̥ti I. 80) and that the Great God (Paramesthin) brought about the creation and destruction of the world during the Manvantaras. Some of the Puranas such as Matsya (9. 37-39, 142. 40, 144. 97-98), Vayu (59. 34), Agni (150.21), Viṣṇu ( I. 3 and VI. 3) state 1090a that Manu and the seven sages in each Manvantara (i. e. where there is a change of Manu) who are the sistas that then exist are devoted to dharma, being ordered by Brahmā for the purpose of continuing the worlds, declare the truth and promulgate the Vedas.

<p>writers (like Dr. Daftari ) think 10906 that in ancient times there was an Indian institution of public functionaries called Manu and the Saptarsis, whose function was to legislate and promul gate the Vedas. With great respect to the erudite scholar, I dis agree with him. The extant Purāṇa passages are less than 2000 years old, while the present Vaivasvata Manyantara started several millions of years ago and even Kaliyuga in which we are deemed to live started in 3102 B.C. Besides, there is a dissolution of the world at each day of Brahmā, if one is to rely on the Paurāṇik accounts. How could a tradition of the several Manus survive such pralaya? A rationalistic interpretation requires that all this that is stated in the Purāṇas is mere conjecture and imagination and that one cannot safely build theories about the governance of society in ancient times on the accounts contained in Purāṇas. The Manusmști (11, 19 ) appears to assign the function of the regulation of the conduct of all men in the world to the learned brāhmaṇas born in Brahmarṣideśa (i. e. Kuruksetra, the countries of Matsya, Pañcāla and Surasena or Mathura) at least after his own code was promulgated.</p>
<p>Pessimistic and dismal accounts of what will happen in Kaliyuga ( which extends according to the Purāṇas over 432000 years and of which only about 5057 years have gone by this time in 1956 ) are set forth in the Vanaparva, chap. 188, 190, Sānti parya 69. 80-97, the Harivamsa (Bhaviṣyaparva, chap. 3-5 ff.), Brahmapurāṇa chap. 229-230, Vāyu chap. 58 and 99 verses 391-428, Matsya 144. 32-47, Kurma I. 30, Viṣṇupurāṇa VI. 1, Bhāgayata XII. 1-2, Brahmānda II. 31 and in several other purāṇas. The description in Vanaparva 188 is summarised in H. of Dh. vol. III pp. 893-895. The names of 33 Kalpas are given in Vāyu, chap. 21-23 and Hemādri on Kāla (pp. 670-671 ) sets out from Nāgarakhanda the names of 33 Kalpas and the tithis on which they start; Matsya 290 enumerates thirty names of Kalpas; the Brahmapda Il. 31. 119 states that there are 35 Kalpas and neither more nor less.</p>

<p>( when a day of Brahmā ends, then there is a dissolution of the world), prākrtika ( when everything dissolves itself into prakrti, primordial substance) and ātyantika pralaya is Mikșa (liberation of the soul due to correct knowledge of Reality and absorption into the Supreme Spirit ). Harrowing descriptions of the naimittika and prākṛtika pralayas are given in several purānas. A lengthy description of the naimittika dissolution is contained in Kūrma II. 45. 11-59 of which a brief summary is given here. When the one thousand Caturyugas end, there is the absence of rain for a hundred years; the result is that living beings perish and are reduc ed to earth; the sun&rsquo;s rays become unbearable, and even the ocean is dried up; the earth is burnt by the fierce heat of the sun together with its mountains, forests and continents. As the sun&rsquo;s rays fall burning up everything, the whole world presents the appearance of one huge fire. Fire burns everything whether mobile or immoveable. The animals in the big seas come out and are reduced to ashes. Then the samyartaka fire growing by the force of the wind burns the whole earth and its flames rise up to a height of thousands of yojanas and the flames burn up gandharras, goblins, yakṣas, serpents and rākṣasas and not only the earth but the worlds called &lsquo;bhuvaḥ&rsquo; and &lsquo;mahaḥ&rsquo; are burnt; then huge sasvartaka clouds resembling herds of elephants, lit up by lightning, rise in the sky, some looking like blue lotuses, some yellowish, some having the colour of smoke, some like sealing wax and fill the whole sky and then extinguish the fires by sending down heavy showers. When the fires are extingu ished, the clouds of destruction cover the whole world with floods; mountains are concealed and the earth is plunged in waters and all becomes onle ocean of water and then god Brahmā resorts to Yogic sleep. Vanaparva ( chap. 273. 32-48) also contains a brief description of nainittika pralaya.</p>

<p>Description of prākstika pralaya</p>

<p>including all the nether regions are destroyed by absence of rains and all effects from mahat onwards are destroyed, waters first absorb the gandha (the special quality of the earth ) and when gandha-tanmātra is destroyed, the earth is reduced to water; the special quality of waters, viz. rasa-tanmātra is des troyed and nothing but fire remains and the whole world is filled with flames, then Vāyu absorbs fire and rūpa-tanmātra vanishes ; Vāyu shakes all the ten quarters; ākāśa absorbs the sparsa-guna of Vāyu and only ākāśa remains as a void and sabda-tanmātra is gone and in this way the seven prakrtis including mahut and ahankāra are absorbed in order; even Praksti and Purusa are dissolved in Paramātman ( named Viṣṇu). The day of Viṣṇu is said to be two Parārdhas of human years.</p>
<p>Some works like the Harivamsa (Bhaviṣyaparva chap. 10. 12-68) provide that at the end of Kalpa the sage Mārkandeya alone remains and lies at the time of the pralaya( or kalpa ) in the side of Lord Vispu and then coines out of His mouth. The Brahma. purāṇa ( 52.1&ndash;19 and 53. 55) says that Mārkandeya soes a rata tree at the end of Kalpa and a jewelled bed on which he sees a boy lying down (i. e. Vispu himself ) and then he enters the side of that boy and later comes out. Vide also Matsya 167 (14-66) for the same story in almost the same words. The Bhagavadgitā (VIII. 18-19) speaks of the recurrent absorption of all beings at the advent of the night of Brahma and reappearance of beings when the day of Brahmā starts.</p>
<p>The theory of yugas, manyantaras and kalpas with their fabulous numbers of years and harrowing descriptions of pralaya, appears unreal, bizarre and called up by sheer fancy. But under lying it there is the idea of the timelessness of the universe, though from time to time it evolves, gradually declines and perishes, only to reappear in perfection after a cosmic night. There is also the hankering after Reality and pursuit of different ideals. It enshrines the ideas that humanity embarks on a certain goal, pursues it with great efforts and, after achiev ing some success, gives up that goal and the way that was thought to lead to it and pursues some other goal for aoons in the hope that at some distant date it will be able to evolve and</p>

<p>construct a perfect society. These ideas are at the bottom of what Manu 1093 and others say Tapas was the highest goal (deemed to yield great results ) in Kitayuga, knowledge (of the self) was the highest in Tretā, yajña (sacrifices to God) in Dvāpara, charity alone in Kali&rsquo;. This further implies that there are different impelling motives in different ages and modern men should not assess the actions and ideals of past ages by the same yardstick that is applied to contemporary actions and ideals. It is im plicit in the words of Manu (XI.301 ) that the four ages are not water-tight specific periods of time, but that the Ruler or Govern ment can produce conditions of Kṭta age in what is popularly called Kali by appropriate conduct or measures and Medhātithi expressly says so. 109a Prof. Mankad has a novel theory in a paper on the manvantaras in I. H. Q. vol XVIII, pp. 208–230, where he states that the Caturyuga formula took 40 years for a ruling unit and not for one king&rsquo;s regnal period and that the manvantara was the regular method of calculating regnal periods of different kings in a dynasty (p. 237 ). Hardly any scholar has accepted this theory and for reasons of space and relevance, it is not possible to discuss it here.</p>
<p>In the details about the theory of yugas, manvantaras and kalpas there are some divergences. A few may be pointed out. Āryabhata appears to hold that the extent of each of the four yugas was the same and not in the traditional proportion of 4, 3, 2, 1, when he says that he was twenty-three years old when three yugapārlas and 3600 years had elapsed (vide Kālakriyāpāda 10 quoted in note 995 above ). Brahmagupta (I. 9) says 1094 that, though Aryabhata declared that the four pādas of yugas, viz. Kr̥ta</p>

<p>and the others, were equal, not one of them was equal to what the smr̥tis declare them to be. There is another discrepancy also. Aryabhata in his Dasagitikā Verse 3 states that Manu is a period of 72 yugas, while all the smr̥tis and purānas declare that a manvantara is equal to 71 yugas. Āryabhata appears to have held that the day of Brahmā is equal to 1008 caturyuyas and Brahmagupta ( I. 12) refers to this view. The celebrated scientific astronomer Bhāskarācārya 1095 (born in saka 1036, 1114 A. D.) impatiently says some say that half of the life of Brahmā (i. e. 50 years ) has passed away, while others say that half plus eight years has passed away. Whatever the true tradi tion may be, it is of no use, since planetary positions are to be established from the days that have passed in the current day of Brahmā.&rsquo;</p>
<p>As incidental to the colossal figures of the years of Kalpas and Yugas, a few words on numerals, their antiquity and the methods of writing numerals would not be out of place, In the Rgveda numerals from 1 to 10 are frequently used. &lsquo;Sahasra (thousand) and&rsquo; ayuta&rsquo;( ten thousand) occur in Rg. IV. 26.7, VIII. 1. 5, VIII. 21 18. One of these sa yg 10% O wielder of thunderbolt! O immensely rich ( Indra )! I shall not give thee away even for a big price, not for a thousand, not for ten thousand, nor for hundreds&rsquo;. In Rg. VIII. 46.22 a poet says &lsquo;I secured 60000 and several tens of thousands of horses, 20 hundreds of camels, one thousand dark coloured mares and ten thousands of cows bright in three parts of their bodies.&rsquo; In Rg. I. 53. 9 Indra is said to have struck down sixty thousand and 99 enemies. Vide Rg. I. 126. 3 ( for sixty thousand cows), VIII, 4. 20 and VIII. 46. 29 for 60000 and VI. 63. 10 for one hundred thousand horses. In some of these the larger numbers are mentioned first and the smaller ones next (as in Rg. I. 53. 9, VIII. 46. 22 ); in others it is the reverse. No conclusion can therefore be drawn that the smaller numbers come first in the Rgvedic times. In Tai. S. IV. 4. 11. 3-4 reference is made to bricks in numbers from one, one hundred, thousand, ayuta ( ten thousand), niyuta, prayuta, arbuda, nyarbuda, samudra, madhya, anta and parardha, while in Tai. S. VII. 2. 11-19 various numbers from one to one</p>

V. 4. 11. 3-4 (from &lsquo;Sahasrasya prami. asi&rsquo; to — istaka. dhe davah santu&rsquo; ). These references show that names for astronomical numbers of years had been settled at least more than a thousand years before Christ. One should like to know the names of numbers in Greece corresponding to the words from arbuda onwards. The Nirukta (III. 10) gives the derivation of eka, dvi, tri, catur, asta, nava, dasa, vimsati, sata, sahasra, ayuta, niyuta, prayuta, arbuda. Pāṇini (V. 1. 59 ) mentions pankti ( ten), viinsati, trimsat, catvārimsat, pancasat, sasti, saptati, aśīti, navati and sata and the Mahābhāṣya on the 4th vārtika on that sūtra mentions sahasra, ayuta and arbuda among numbers. In Sabhiparva 1097 numbers from aynta to parūridh i are mentioned as noted below. Aryabhata mentions 1098 only ten orders from eka to arbuda. ( hundred million) and vinda ( thousand million). The Vayupurana (101. 93-102) mentions the 18 orders of numbers from one to parārdha in a slightly confused manner. It may be noted that the ancient Greeks had no single word for</p>
<p>million.</p>
<p>The Vispupurāna 1099 states that parārdha is 18th order of numbers from one, each order being ten times as much as its predecessor. The 18 orders or units of reckoning as employed for many centuries in India are set out here. 1100</p>

<p>That the decimal system itself goes back thousands of years from the present follows from the references in the Samhitās. But the question whether the lecinul positional or place valuz system prevailed in Vedic times is rather a different and difficult one. It is generally 1101 admitted that the place value decimal system that now prevails in Europe and all modern countries was Indian in origin and was introduced about the 12th century A. D. in Europe by the Arabs who borrowed it from India. The decimal place value notation is said to be one of the most fertile inven</p>

<p>tions of man. There is a good deal of literature on this subject which is passed over here as not material for our purpose. One of the latest works on this system is · From Zero to Infinity' by Constance Reid (Routledge and Kegan Paul, London, 1956). Zero is the first of ten symbols with which one can represent an infinitude of numbers and it is also the first of the numbers. This work says that the zero escaped even the greatest Greeks, Pythagoras, Euclid and Archimedes (p. 4). The Egyptians 1102 had a decimal system of numerals but no sign for zero and therefore no positional notation, which even the Greeks did not know; ancient Babylonians also had no definite symbol for zero and there is no example of zero signs at the end of numbers even in their latest astronomical writings. It is difficult to say when exactly a symbol or word for zero was employed in India. But it must nave been several centuries before the beginning of the Christian era. Pingala&rsquo;s work on metres is a terlūnga. Pingala&rsquo;s sūtra on metres makes use of zero (śūnya ) in VIII. 28-31. Even the Satapatha Br. (XI. 4. 3 20) seems to be aware of Vedāngas. But it may be argued that there is nothing to show that Piogala&rsquo;s work was known to it. It is most probably</p>

<li>Vide &lsquo;Legacy of Egypt&rsquo; (Glanville p. 166), E S. A. by Neuge bauer p. 20, Sarton in &lsquo;a History of Science&rsquo; p. 69; Prof. Neugebauer in JAOS. vol. 61 pp. 213-215 avers that strong arguments exist for the assump tion that the Babylonian methods of calculation weot, together with Greek Astronomy, to India, and that, sometime in the first centuries of the Christian era, the corresponding decimal place value Dotation in India, which through the Arabs gave rise to the modern system of Europe. With great respect the author must demur to these assertions, The learned writer endeavours to show that a peculiar sign was used for zero in Mesopotamian cuneiform texts. The important questions that must be answered are; who discovered the symbol for zero now used almost throughout the world, whether the so-called sign for zero which Prof. Neugebauer asserts he has discovered in cuneiform texts was ever used in Europe or for that matter any. where in the world except in Mesopotamia, what direct relation exists between the Indian zero symbol and the recently discovered zero symbol ( which no one had found so far ), whether the symbols for 1 to 9 in India bear any resemblance to the Mesopotamian symbols for these numbers, whether the Greeks (who admittedly borrowed many tbiogs from Meso potamia ) used the Mesopotamian zero symbol and, if so, when. The 19th century was distinguished by the theories of Western Scholars claiming that science, pbilosophy and arts began in Greece and that other nations borrowed these from the Greeks. That bubble of Greek primacy in these matters has now been pricked. The twentinth century appears to be heading for giviog to Mesopotamia the place once assigned to the Greeks. The Mesopotamian bubble raised by some scholars may be pricked in course of time, particularly as regards others borrowing from them.</li>

<p>Several methods of writing numerals</p>
<p>701</p>
<p>mentioned as Chandoviciti in the Āpastamba-dharmasūtra 1103 Sabara 1104 ( about 200 A. D. and not later than 400 A. D.) speaks of Pingala&rsquo;s work as on the same level with Pāṇini&rsquo;s sūtra. It is unnecessary to offer further proofs of the antiquity of Pingala&rsquo;s sūtra.</p>
<p>There were several methods of writing numerals. One was the place value notation, in which the same numeral has different values according to the place it occupies; for example, the figure two may have the value of only two or twenty or two hundred and so on according as it occupies the units place or tens place or hundreds place. Another way is that of employing words to denoto complete numbers. This was a very reliable method when in astronomy huge figures had to be employed and works were not printed but only copied by hand. In ancient times, the writers of mss. might often omit zeros or other figures, but if words with a fixed meaning in relation to numbers were used, they would not be so easily dropped and as many works were metrical, the omission of a word, if any, might have been far more easily detected. It is difficult to say when this system was introduced. But its beginnings are ancient. For example, the word krta -is used in the Taittiriya 1105 Brāhmaṇa in the sense of &lsquo;four&rsquo;. Varāhamihira (beginning of the 6th century A. D. I employs these word numerals but in the place value system (vide H. of Dh. vol. III, p. 897 n. 1763.) The following is a list of some of the very usual numbers with the corresponding words employed to indicate them It should be noted that the list is not exhaus tive. Any number of synonyms 1106 may be employed to indicate the same number. Vide the lists in Alberuni ( Sachau, vol. I. pp. 174-179 ) and Bühler&rsquo;s &lsquo;Indian Paleography&rsquo; (I. A. vol. 33; appendix pp. 83-86 ).</p>

<p>and in Brhat-sambitā 8. 20 and by all later astronomical writers. 1109 The particular matter to be noted is that the first word in a group ( denoting a number ) is to be assigned to the units place, the next to its left in the tens place, so that a word like &lsquo;saptāśvi-veda-sankhyam&rsquo; becomes 4:7 (by the rule &lsquo;ankānām vāmato gatih&rsquo;).</p>
<p>Another method for expressing numbers is elaborated by Āryabhata in his Daśagitikāpāda 1119 ( verse 3) where the letters from k ( kā also ) to m have the values of 1 to 25, while y&rsquo;i, ru, la, va, śa, șa, sa and ha stand for 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90 and 100 and so on towards more complicated matters.</p>
<p>The fourth anga in a pancānga is called Yoga. There is no direct astronomical phenomena corresponding to it. It is calculated from the suin of the longitudes of the Sun and the Moon (or it is the time during which the sun and the moon together accomplish 13 degrees and 20 minutes of space). When this amounts to degrees 13. 20 the first Yoga called Viskambha ends; when it amounts to 26. 40 the 2nd Yoga Prīti ends and so on. The yogas are 27 ( that thus make 360 degrees ) as stated</p>

<p>Ever-recurring yogas</p>
<p>705</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>These are nitya (ever-recurring) Yogas. The Ratnamala states that they yield good or bad results in keeping with their names. The Muhurtadarśana 1111 states that among these 27 yogas nine are condemned, viz. Parigha, Vyatipāta, Vajra, Vyaghata, Vaidhrti, Viskambha, Sula, Ganda1112 and Atiganda. The Ratnarnālā provides that Vyatipāta and Vaidhști aro wholly inauspicious, the first half of Parigha is so and only the first quarter of those Yogas the names of which are odious; and that one should avoid in all auspicious rites the first three ghaṭikās in Viskambha and Vajra, nine ghaṭis in Vyāghāta, five in Sūla, six in Ganda and Atiganda. The Agnipurana 1113 (127. 1-2) has similar verses. The Kālanirṇaya-kārikā 1114 provides that when a Yoga spreads over two days, fasts and the like are to be observed on the first of the two days provided that Yoga exists at sunset on that day, and vratas and religious gifts are to be performed on the latter ( of two days ) provided the Yoga exists for three</p>
<p>muhurtas (i. e. six ghaṭis) after sunrise and for sraddha the day on which the Yoga extends over the time required for the śrāddha rite should be accepted,</p>
<p>The system of Yogas must be held to be ancient. The Yājña valkyasmr̥ti (I. 218) when specifying the times for the perfor mance of śrāddhas includes Vyatīpāta among them. In the Harṣacarita of Bāṇa it is said ( Ucchrāsa IV) that Harsa was born on a day free from the taint of all defects such as Vyatipāta (vyatīpātādi-sarvadosābhiṣanga-rahiteshani). There would gene rally be 13 vyatipātas in a year ( sometimes 14 ) and, among the 96 śrāddhas, śrāddhas on these thirteen vyatipātas are</p>

<p>included (vide H. of Dh. vol. IV pp. 382-383 and note 861 ). Besides these 27 Yogas, there are others that occur when there are special conjunctions of weekdays with certain tithis and naksatras or when certain planets occupy certain rāśis on certain tithis and nakṣatras. For Kapilāṣasthiyoga and Ardho daya, vide above pp. 279 and 261. Vyatipāta itself has two technical senses apart from being 17th out of the 27 Yogas mentioned above viz. (1) When amāvāsyā 1115 occurs on a Sunday and the moon is in the first quarter on any one of the nakṣatras Sravaṇa, Aśvini, Dhanisthā, Ārdrā and Āśleṣā that is Vyatīpāta; (2) When on the 12th of the bright half Jupiter and Mars are in the sign Lion, the Sun is in Ram and when that tithi has Hasta naksatra on it, it is Vyatipāta 1116 Yoga. These two are sometimes called Mahāvyatipāta. Gifts made on those conjunc tions are very much commended ;1117 &lsquo;gifts on amāvāsyā yield one hundred-fold merit, on the suppression of a tithi a thousand-fold, on Visuva day ten thousand-fold, buton Vyatīpāta endless (merit). By gifts of cows, land, gold and clothes made on this the donor becomes free from sin and secures godhead, the position of Indra, health, the rulership of men. 1118 The Sūryasiddhānta (XI. 1-2) gives an explanation of Vyatipāta and Vaidhrta1119 (or Vaidhrti). when the sun and the moon are on the same side of either solstice and when the sum of their longitudes being a circle they are of equal declination it is styled Vaidhști. When the moon and the sun are on opposite sides of either solstice and their minutes of declination are the same, it is Vyatīpāta, the sum of their</p>

<p>In the pancangas several Yogas (that have nothing to do with the 27 yogas ) like Amrtasiddhi, Yamaghanta, Dagdhayoga, Mrtyuyoga, Ghabāda are mentioned; they are purely astrological and all of them except three are passed over here for reasons of space. When on Sunday there is Hasta, on Monday Mļgaśirsa, on Tuesday Aśvini, on Wednesday Anurādha, on Thursday Tisya (i. e. Pusya ), on Friday Revati and on Saturday Rohini, all these are Amṛtasiddhiyogas (fortunate ones 1120 ). Avoid Anu rādhā on Sunday, Uttarāsādhā on Monday, Satatārakā on Tuesday, Aśvini on Wednesday, Mrgaśīrṣa on Thursday, Aślosa on Friday and Hasta on Saturday&ndash; these are seven Mṛtyuyogas (inauspicious ). If the weekdays from Sunday to Saturday occur on the tithis, 12th, 11th, 10th, 3rd, 6th, 2nd, 7th respec tively, these are Dagdhayogas ( inauspicious yogas).</p>

Karanas are of two kinds, viz, cara (moving) and sthira ( immoveable). The seven cara karañas with their presiding deities according to Brhatsamhitā, chap. 99. 1-2 are: 1. Bava-Indra; 2. Bālava-Brahmā; 3 Kaulava-Mitra; 4. Taitila-Aryaman; 5. Gara ( or Garaja )- Earth; 6. Vanija Śrī; 7. Visti-Yama. The four sthira karaṇas with their deitieg are : 1. Sakuni &ndash;Kali; 2. Catuspada - Vrsa; 3. Nāga-snake; 4. Kimstughna-Vāyu. Some works transpose the two, Catuspada and Nāga. This division of a tithi into two halves resembles the division of a rāśi into two horās (Brbajjātaka I. 9). It is likely that one was suggested by the other. The difficulty is to decide which was the earlier. I believe it likely that the division of tithis into two karapas is the earlier of the two. The sthira karapas occur only once in a month i. e, on the latter half of</p>

<p>14th tithi of dark half occurs Sakuni: Catuspada and Nāga occupy the two halves of amāvāsyā and Kimstughna occurs on the first half of Pratipad i. e, if the 30 tithis of an aminta month are divided into 60 halves, Sakuni, Catuspada and Nāga occupy the 58th, 59th and 60th parts and Kimstughna occupies the first half of the pratipad of the next month. Bava occupies the second half of śukla pratipad and the others follow one after another and as they are only seven they are repeated eight times in a month from the 2nd half of pratipad to the first half of the 14th tithi of a dark half, which would be 57th of the sixty halves of the tithis of the month and would be occupied by Visti. In the pancāngas, two karanas should properly be shown under each tithi, but in pañcāngas only that Karaṇa is shown against a tithi whose ending moment is 30 ghaṭikās or less from sunrise. The ending times of Karanas which are assigned to the 2nd halves of tithis coincide with those of the tithis themselves and therefore there is no need for their calculation. The ending times of the first halves of tithis which correspond to certain Karanas are got in the manner described by Pillai in his Indian Ephemeris&rsquo;, vol. I. part 1 p. 37, paragraphs 106-107.</p>
<p>The word Karaṇa is derived from the root&rsquo;ks&rsquo; (to do ) and is said to have been so named because it divides a tithi in two parts. 1121 The names of most of the Karanas are somewhat strange and inexplicable. The word &lsquo;Taitila-kadrū&rsquo; occurs in Pāṇini VI. 2. 42 (with regard to accent) but the Kāśikā ex plains that Taitila means a descendant or pupil or Titilin'. If a more conjecture were to be offered, the Karaħa Taitila might have been first named after a man so called. The Karañas are only of astrological use and must have been named many centuries before 400 A. D. The Nāradapurāna 1122 mentions both kinds of Karañas. The Brhat-samhitā lays down what should be done or not done on the several Karanas 1123 as follows: one</p>

<p>What should be done on Karanas</p>
<p>709</p>
<p>should perform on Bava all auspicious ( religious ) rites, all acts that bring about physical health: on Bālava religious acts and acts beneficial to brāhmaṇas; on Kaulava acts leading to good relations and friendship and choosing a bride; on Taitila acts that lead to popularity with people, to securing the patronage ( of some important person ) and building a house : on Gara actions pertaining to ploughing, sowing seeds and those that arise in houses; on Vanija, acts of a permanent nature, trading, and meeting with people; whatever is done on Visti does not bring about fortunate results; but actions as regards destruction of enemies, poisoning and incendiarism become successful on it; on Sakuni one should do what leads to physical health and inedication, planting roots and eating them and becoming suc cessful in mantras; on Catuspada actions relating to cows (i. e. gifts of them and rearing them ), actions regarding brāhmanas and one&rsquo;s ancestors and king&rsquo;s business should be done; on Nāga, acts relating to immoveable property, cruel acts, depriv ing ( a man of his wealth or wife ) and acts that lead to hatred among people; on Kimstughna, auspicious ( religious ) acts, Vedic sacrifices (called iṣtis ) and acts leading to physical prosperity and mangala acts (marriage &amp;c.) and other acts that bring success in these matters.</p>
<p>One very noticeable feature is that the 7th mobile Karana called Visti appears to have inspired great terror in the minds of medieval writers on Dharmaśāstra. It will be noticed that dividing the lunar month into 60 halves of tithis, and beginning Bava on the second half of the pratipad of an amānta month, the Karana Visti will occur eight times in one month as the following diagram of the sixty halves will show:</p>

<p>710</p>
<p>Sec. II, Ch. XIX</p>
<p>In the dark half, 1124 Visti will occur in the latter half of the third and 10th tithis and in the first half of the 7th and 14th tithis; in the bright half Visti will occur in the latter half of the 4th and 11th tithis and the first half of the 8th and 15th (i. e. Paurnamāśi) tithis. The Rājamārtaṇḍa 1125 states. Some regard Visti as having the form of a cobra and as terrible; there is danger in the mouth of a snake but not in its tail. The mouth, neck, chest, navel region, waist and tail of Visti are respectively of five, one, eleven, four, six and three ghaṭikās. Great sages declare that it (Visti ) does not confer fortunate results, therefore a good man should avoid these except the tail' (on last three ghaṭikās of Visti auspicious acts may be performed). Visti is also euphemistically called Bhadrā or Kalyāni (it is really abhadrā). The terrible nature of Visti is described in two verses of Bhima-parākrama quoted in Bhujabala-nibandha p. 30 ( vide pp. 95–96 of my paper on ‘Bhoja and his works &amp;c.' in Journal of Oriental Research, Madras, vol. XXIII for 1953-54 ) which also occur in Rājainārtanda, verses 1021-22.</p>
<p>The whole scheme of Karanas is itself fanciful. But to draw a lurid picture of one of them, Visti (which occurs eight times in a month ), and say that it is like a cobra or an ogress is the height of imagination dominated by astrological considerations.</p>
<p>Having described at some length the five angas in a pancānga, a few words must be said about Hindu calendars, though it has been already declared above that purely astro nomical matters will not be elaborated in this work. In the</p>

<p>Numerous pañcũngas in India</p>
<p>711</p>
<p>continent of India there are numerous pañcāngas in vogue and there is something like anarchy in this sphere. Hardly any two pancāngas agree completely. Many educated I ndians have been demanding that such matters as eclipses, the times of which can be noted by anyone, should be accurately predicted by the almanacs and that our ancient methods of calculating the motions of heavenly bodies should be brought in line with modern accurate calculations based upon observations. This is just what scientific astronomers like Varāhamihira would have done if they were living in modern times. At the end of his two works Varāha makes a very candid but solemn request 1126</p>
<p>whatever in this work comes to be unscientific while it is being used or on account of defects in the mss, or whatever may have been badly executed by me or insufficiently done or not done at all, that should be corrected by learned men, leaving aside all passion / jealousy ), and after acquiring (knowledge ) from the lips of well-read mon.' Somne almanac-makers follow the Nautical Almanac tables as to eclipses and the like and set out other matters according to the old tables. As already stated there are three main schools of astronomers in India, (1) the school that follows the Sūrya-siddhānta (and is called Saurapakṣa ), (2) the second follows the Brahma-siddhānta (and is called Brāhma pakṣa ), (3) the third follows the Āryasiddhānta (and is styled Āryapakṣa ). There are two main points of difference between these, viz. (1) the length of the year, (2) the number of revolu tions of the sun, the moon and the planets in a certain period such as a mahāyuga. The difference in the length of the year among the siddhāntas is very small viz. a few vipilus ( a ripala being alth part of a vala, which again is oth of a ghaṭikā that is equal to 24 minutes). The length of the year according to the Sūryasiddhanta is 365 days 15 ghaṭis, 31. 523 palis, while the interval in time between two successive returns of the sun to the vernal equinox (called the tropical year) is only 365 days, 14 ghaṭis and 31. 972 palas and the correct sideral ( nāksatra) year is 365 days, 15 ghaṭis, 2 palas and 53 vipalas (vide C. R. C. Report p. 240 in hours, minutes and seconds and Dikshit&rsquo;s History ed. of 1931 pp. 159, 440). The result is that if one follows the Sūryasiddhānta, the starting point of Hindu astronomers is at present more than 23 degrees to the east of the correct vernal equinox point. This difference is called the ayanāṁsa.</p>

<p>As the longitudes of heavenly bodies reckoned from the equinox include these ayunāmsas they are called sāyana ( sa + ayana ). The places of heavenly bodies obtained by the methods of the Sūryasiddhanta and medieval Sanskrit works are distinguished by being called niruyana ( devoid of taking into account procession). At present according to most almanacs that employ the Sūryasiddhānta values Makarasankrānti (Sun&rsquo;s entrance into Capricorn) falls generally on 14th January, but according to the most accurate modern calculations, it should fall on 21st December; even in calendars that pride themselves on being suddha the Makarasankranti falls on 9th January i. e. our Makarasankrānti is celebrated 1127 about 23 or 18 days later than it should be and the same happens to the vernal equinox, autumnal equinox and the summer solstice and many other observances. Aśvini is still reckoned as the first naksatra (in which the vernal equinox is deemed to have occurred about saka 444 ), although the vernal equinox point has receded to the Uttara-bhādrapadā group of stars ( which should now be treated as the first naksatra). Efforts have been made by those familiar with the modern accurate calculations (such as the late Kero L. Chatre) to introduce modrn calculations in our almanacs; but they have met with little response. The late Lokamānya Tilak (who was a great Vedic scholar and mathematician) held several conferences of Indian astronomers and other interested people at Bombay (1904), Poona (1917) and at Sangli (1919). At the last conference several resolutions were passed which without making a total break with the past were calculated to reform our calendar and to prevent furthur deterioration. It is un necessary to set out all the resolutions, but the most impor tant were that the length of the year should be that of the Sūryasiddhānta but subject to necessary corrections, the rate of procession should be accepted at 50.2 ¿ikalās a year (as determined by modern astronomical observations ), that the Yogatārā 1128 of Revati (corresponding to Zeta Piscium of modern astronomers) should be deemed to be the beginning of the</p>

<p>Zodiacal belt / rāśicakrārambhasthāna) and that the ayanāṁsas calculated from the starting point by actual observation should be accepted for the purpose of a new Karaṇa (astronomical manual) to be compiled according to the resolutions. Unfortu nately the resolutions did not state where exactly the star Zeta Piscium was in a particular saka year. Dr. K. L. Daftari prepared a Karana-grantha called Karanakalpalatā in Sanskrit which was published in 1924. Almanacs based on its data have been published and are sometimes known as Tilak Pañcānga.' But it must be confessed that our people in general are so much custom-ridden that the popular response to the reformed calendar is poor. People still follow the pañcāngas based on the old siddhāntas. According to the śāstras every religious festival is to be celebrated at the proper time i. e. in the right season and on the proper tithi. The tithi depends upon the correct calcula tion of the movements of the moon, which are most difficult to reduce to rules that will give accurate results. Many people will not observe the ekādaśī fast if the eleventh tithi is mixed up with the 10th tithi even for a few ghaṭikās. But what guarantee is there that the 10th tithi has been accurately calculated? The ending moments of tithis do not agree with those given by the Nautical Almanac which are based on modern formula and are verified by actual observation. If tithis be calculated according to different Sanskrit astronomical treatises the moment of a particular tithi may differ by as much as five hours and the same festival (such as Kșspajanmāstami or Dussera ) may be celebrated on two successive days in the same city.</p>
<p>Besides, it must not be forgotten that a pañcānga prepared on the basis of the latitude and longitude of Poona or Bombay will be slightly wrong oven at a distance of 30 or 40 miles to the west or east or north. It would be a great mistake from the religious point of view to employ &amp; pancānga prepared on the basis of the longitude and latitude of Poona or Bombay in a place several hundred miles away (such as in Hyderabad or Aurangabad ). From the religious point of view if accuracy is to be preserved there must be a separate pañcānga for every town or overy place not more than 10 or 15 miles from places like Bombay or Poona where pañcāngas are at present prepared.</p>
<p>In November 1952 the Government of India appointed a committee called the Calendar Reform Committee presided over by Dr. Meghanad Saha to examine all existing calendars being followed at present in India and to submit proposals for an accurate and uniform calendar for the whole of India. That</p>
<p>9, D. 90</p>
<p>714</p>
<p>committee submitted a very exhaustive and valuable report in November 1955. The final recommendations of the Committee for a civil calendar and for a religious calendar are set out on pp. 6-8 of the report. They are deserving of the most serious consideration by all who feel that religious observances must be done at the proper time and that now at least in independent India there should not only be one uniform civil calendar, but also one uniform Hindu religious calendar. 1129 It appears that unless Government makes great efforts for the introduction of a correct calendar even for religious purposes, it would be futile to assume that common people will spontaneously adopt a correct pancānga.</p>
<p>Some of the important recommendations of the Committee may be set out here for the information of readers.</p>
<p>Recommendations for civil calendar (1) The Saka era should be used in the unified national calendar.</p>
<p>The Saka year 1876 corresponds to 1954–55 A. D. (2) The year should start from the day following the vernal</p>
<p>equinox day. (3) Normal year is to consist of 365 days, while a leap year</p>
<p>would have 366 days. After adding 78 to the Saka era year, if the sum is divisible by 4, then it would be a leap year. But when the sum becomes a multiple of 100, it would be a leap year only when it is divisible by 400;</p>
<p>otherwise it would be a common year. (4) Caitra (or Chaitra as often written) should be the first</p>
<p>month of the year and the lengths of the different months</p>
<p>should be fixed as follows: Caitra - 30 days (31 days in a Āśvina - 30 days.</p>
<p>leap year ). Vaiśākha -31 days.</p>
<p>Kārtika &ndash;30 days. Jyestha -31 days.</p>
<p>Mārgaśīrsa - 30 days. Āṣāḍha &mdash; 31 days.</p>
<p>Pausa —30 days. Srāvaṇa&ndash;31 days.</p>
<p>Māgha - 30 days. Bhadrapada – 31 days.</p>
<p>Phālguna - 30 days.</p>

</ol>
<p>Calendar Committee&rsquo;s Recommendations</p>
<p>715</p>
<p>The dates of the reformed Indian calendar would thus have a permanent correspondence with the Gregorian 1130 calendar. The corresponding dates would be :</p>
<p>Hindu Gregorian ! Caitra 1-March 22 in a Āśvina 1 - September 23.</p>
<p>common year and</p>
<p>21 in a leap year. Vaisākha 1 - April 21.</p>
<p>Kārtika 1–October 23. Jyestha 1 - May 22.</p>
<p>Mārgaśīrṣa 1 - November 22. Āṣāḍha 1—June 22.</p>
<p>Pausa 1 - December 22. Srāvana 1 &ndash; July 23.</p>
<p>Māgha 1 - January 21. Bhādrapada 1 - August 23. Phālguna 1 - February 20.</p>
<p>The Indian seasons would thus be permanently fixed with respect to the reformed Calendar as follows:</p>
<p>Seasons : Grisma &mdash; Vaisakha and Hemanta – Kārtika and (summer) Jýeṣtha. (late autumn) Mārgasirṣa. Varsā &ndash; Āṣāḍha and Śiśira – Pausa and Māgha. (rains) Śrāvana. (winter) Sarad - Bhadrapada and Vasanta - Phālguna and (Autumn) Aśvina. (Spring ) Caitra.</p>
<p>The States now having the solar calendars for civil and partly religious purposes which start the year from Vaiśākha (April 14th ) will have to begin the year 23 days earlier, but the first month will be Caitra. The effect of this will be that in Bengal, Orissa and Assam solar months start approximately seven days later than now, and in Tamil-nad solar months start approximately 23 days earlier than now, for the month called Vaiśākha (14th April to 14th May) in Bengal and Orissa is called Chittırai (or caitra) in Tamil-nad. Those who use the lunar calendar beginning with Caitra also for civil purposes would experience no great difficulty in adopting this unified calendar</p>

<li>It may be noted that under the Indian Limitation Act (Act I of 1908 ) section 25, all lostruments shall, for the purposses of the Limitation Act, be deamed to be made with reference to the Gregorian Calendar. This rule is absolute and therefore even if a bond is made on a titbl of a lanar month in a certain saka year and is made payable four months after the saka date, the period of limitation applicable to a suit brought on the bond runs from the expiration of four months after the date computed according to the Gregorian Calendar.</li>

<p>History of Dharmaśāstra (Sec. II, Ch. XIX</p>
<p>as they have at present the beginning of their year on various dates from 15th March to 13th April and the first month is Caitra,</p>
<p>Recommendations for religious calendar. (5) The calculation for Saura (solar) months necessary for determining the lunar months of the same name will start 23 degrees and 15 minutes (fixed ayanāmīa ) ahead of the vernal equinox point. This tallies with the present practice of most almanac-makers.</p>
<p>The months would thus commence at the moments when the tropical longitude of the sun attains the following values; viz. Saura Vaiśākha commences when the sun has the longitude of 23° 15', Saura Jyestha and the other Saura months upto Caitra will commence when the sun has respectively the longitude of 53° 15', 83° 15', 113° 15', 143° 15', 173° 15', 203° 15', 233° 15',</p>
<p>263° 15', 293° 15', 323° 15', 353° 15'.</p>
<p>This recommendation is to be regarded only as a measure of compromise, so that a violent break with the established practice would be avoided. But this compromise would not make our present seasons in the several months as they were in the days of Kālidāsa and Varāhmihira. It is hoped that at not a distant date, further reforms for locating the lunar and solar festivals in the seasons in which they were originally observed will be adopted</p>
<p>(6) As usual the lunar months for religious purposes would commence from the moment of new moon and would be named after the saura month in which the new moon falls. If there be two new moons during the period of a Saura month the lunar month beginning from the first new moon is the adhika or mala māsa and the lunar month beginning from the moment of the second new moon is the suddha or nija māsa as usual.</p>
<p>(7) The moment of the moon&rsquo;s exit from a naksatra division of 13° 20' each or sun&rsquo;s entry into it would be calculat ed with a variable ayanāṁsa ( i. e. on the supposition that they are fixed with respect to the stars ). The value of this ayanāmsa would amount to 23° 15' 0&rdquo; on 21 March 1956. Thereafter it would gradually increases with the annual rate, the mean value of which is about 50.27&quot;.</p>
<p>These arrangements would ensure that the religious obser vances determined by the sun such as the Visuva-sankranti, Uttarāyana-sankrānti and Daksiṇāyana-sankranti would follow</p>
<p>Calendar Committee&rsquo;s Recommendations</p>
<p>717</p>
<p>astronomically correct seasons, but those determined by the lunar calendar would continue to be observed in times conform ing to the present practica and the correction introduced by this report in the length of the year would prevent their further shift in relation to the seasons.</p>
<p>The dates of festivals have already shifted by twenty-three days from the seasons in which they were observed about 1400 years ago as a result of our almanc-makers having ignored the precession of the equinoxes. Although it might appear to some desirable that the entire amount of shifting be wiped out at once, the authors of the Report consider it expedient to maintain this as constant difference and to stop its further increase. As a result there would at present be no deviation from the prevail ing custom in the obgervance of religious festivala.</p>
<p>In the calculation of nakṣatras, however, the Report has adopted a variable ayanāinsa, so that at the time of a particular naksatra the moon may be seen in the sky in the star or star group of that name. This practice has been followed in our country from Vedic times and is perfectly scientific.</p>
<p>(8) The day should be reckoned from midnight to mid night of the central station ( 821 degrees E. Longitude and 239 11' North Latitude ) for civil purposes but for religious purposes the local sunrise system may be followed.</p>
<p>(9) For the purpose of all calculations, the longitudes of the sun and the moon should be obtained by applying the most upto-date and complete equations of their motions, so that they may tally with their actually observed values.</p>
<p>(10) Steps should be taken to compile an Indian Ephe meris and Nautical Almanac' by the Government of India, showing in advance the positions of the sun, the moon, the planets and other heavenly bodies. The Indian calendar, both civil and religious, prepared according to the above recommenda tions should be included in that publication every year.</p>
<p>One can only express the hope that the above mentioned recommendations of the Committee of distinguished astronomers and Sanskrit scholars will receive a wide and hearty response from the Hindu people and that the present confusion and anarchy in the matter of religious observances in our country will come to an end as soon as possible. The Government of India accepted the principal recommendations of the Committee</p>
<p>718</p>
<p>by issuing a Press Note on 23rd October 1956 which decided that the Uniform National Calendar should be adopted with effect from March 22, 1957 corresponding to (Solar) Chaitra 1, 1879, Saka Era, for certain official purposes in conjunction with the Gregorian Calendar and laid down the steps to be taken by the Central Government and the States Governments for imple menting the decision. To avoid misunderstandings and to encou</p>
<p>rage the use by the mass of the people of this Solar Calendar, Government has decided to make use of both the Gregorian Calendar and the New Indian Solar Calendar together in some Government business, such as publishing the Indian Government Gazette with both dates, the All India Radio Broadcasting news every day announcing both dates at the beginning. But Government is not going to give up as far as possible the practice of declaring public holidays on religious festivals according to the old Calendars. The Government will publish translations of the Calendar Reform Committee&rsquo;s Report in the principal languages of India. It must be said however that this Calendar does not remove all the defects of the Gregorian Calendar.1131 The years will still commence on different week days and the number of days in each month still varies. It is feared that this will add only one more calendar to the existing ones.</p>

<li>The Gregorian calendar now in general use in Europe and other parts of the world is irregular, unbalarred and inconvenient (vide pp. 643-44 above. ). For twenty-five years the World Calendar Association founded by Miss, Elisabeth Achelis in New York has been dedicatiog its time and resources to the introdution of the World Calendar in many lands. The outstanding features of this world calendar are : Every year is the same and begins on Sunday, 1st January and ends on Saturday: each of its four quarters has 91 days, 13 weeks or three inocths; January, April, July and October have 31 days each and the other months bavę 30 days each; the Calendar is stabilized and made perpet al by ending the year with a 365th day following 30th December each ye . This additional day is named W (it is a World Holiday) and equal to 31st December, Yo a leap year a day is added at the end of the 2nd quarter, is oamed w, ecuais 31 June, called Leap year day and is another World Holid * The Voited Nations Organi zation has not yet lent its support to the Wild Calendar. An interesting work is &lsquo;Time counts: the story of the Calendar. by Harold Watkios (London, 1954.)</li>
