CHAPTER XV 

Units of Kāla 

We shall now turn to the units of time from yuga back. wards to muhūrta, leaving aside Manvantara, Kalpa and Pralaya for the moment. 

The word 'yuga' occurs at least 33 times in the Rgveda and appears to have been used in several senses. Vide H. of Dh. vol. III. p. 886-890. Two senses stand out as prominent, viz. a short period or a very long period. For the first sense we may cite Rg. I. 158. 6 ( 'Dīrgbatamas, the son of Mamatā, became old in the 10th Yuga, he became brahmā high priest and leader of the waters flowing to their goal'.699 Here yuga cannot mean a period of more than ten years and probably means a period of five years; in Rg. III. 26.3 we read 'like a neighing horse by its mother, Vaiśvānara ( Agni) is kindled by the Kuśikas in each yuga'; vide Rg. 111.55.18.700 In the Vedāngajyotisa 701 (verses 1 and 5 ) yuga is said to comprise five years. There is nothing to prevent us from taking this sense in the two passages cited from the Rgveda. In Rg. III. 55.18 it is possible to recognize a recondite refer ence to five year units of time each divided into six seasons. In the Rgveda samvatsara means a year in several passages such as I. 110. 4, I. 140.2, I. 161. 13, I. 164. 44, VII, 103. 1, 7, 9, X. 190.2. In Rg. X, 87. 17 we have the derivative form 'Samvat saripa '702 from samyatsara 'O Agni that observest what men dol May the demon possessing magic devices not partake of the cow's milk that springs after a year'. In Rg. X. 62.2 we have

the word parivatsara 'those ancestors that shattered Vala by righteousness and forced out the wealth consisting of cows' and in Rg. VII, 103.8 the word 'parivatsarīṇa: Samvatsara and Parivatsara are two of the five names bestowed on the five years of a yuga in the other samhitās. Just as the word yuga was used in several senses even in the Rgveda it is quite possible that the words 'samvatsara' and 'parivatsara' meant simply year and also successive years of a cycle of five years. In the Tai. S. (V. 5. 7. 1–3 ) namaskāru ( salutation) is offered to Rudra with Samvatsara, to his bow towards the right with Parivatsara, to his bow behind with Idāvatsara, to the bow towards the north with Iduvatsara and to the bow above with Vatsara. The Vāj. S. ( 27. 45 ) names these five separately with Idā vatsara in place of Iduvatsara; similarly, in Atharva VI. 55.3 salutation is offered to Idāvatsara, Parivatsara and Samvatsara. In Tai. Br. (1. 4. 10.1 703 ) Agni, Aditya, Candramas and Vāyu are identified with Samvatsara, Parivatsara, Idāvatsara and Anuvatsara and it should be noticed that the four names of years are brought in close relation to the four cāturmāsyas, viz. Vaiśvadova, Varuṇa praghāsa, Sākamedha and Sunāsiriya. Thus even in the Samhi tās names (generally five ) are mentioned in a certain fixed order. There is no reason why this should be so unless they formed a fixed series in a cycle. Thibaut in his Grundriss (p. 9) hammers on the fact that sometimes only two or three or four out of the five are mentioned and argues (rather obstinately ) that knowledge of the five year yuga cannot be assumed for the Vedic times. It should be noted that Kautilya speaks of the yuga of five samvatsaras and of the insertion of two intercalary months, one at the end of 21 years and the other at the end of 

five years. 704

(Soc. II, Ch. XV 

The Mahābhārata knows of the yuga of five years 705 (in Sabhāparva 11. 38). The Pitāmahasiddhānta, 7:6 which is not extant now, stated, according to the Pañcasiddhāntikā of Varāhamihira, that yuga means five years of the Sun and the Moon and that an intercalary month was added after thirty months. 

The next question is: what was the extent of the year in the Vedic age. Some Rk. verses may be cited in this connection. 

• The wheel 707 of sta has twelve spokes; it revolves round the heavens; it does never wear out. O Agnil in this ( wheel) seven hundred and twenty sons in pairs abide. Some say that the father (Sun) who sends down water has five feet and twelve forms and remains endowed with fulness in the distant half (part) of heavens while others say that he ( the Sun), the all-seeing, is placed in a lower ( place) that has seven wheels and six spokes; all the worlds abide in the revolving wheel with five spokes; one wheel and twelve rims ( of the wheel) and three naves-who is there that knew these ( thoroughly ); in that ( wheel i. e. year) are placed together three hundred and sixty very unstable nails' (Rg. I. 164. 11-13 and 48 ). In these passages the sage poses a riddle or puzzle in very metaphorical and mystic language about a year divided into three, five or six seasons, twelve months, 360 days and 720 days and nights (when calculated separately ). It is possible to hold that the wheel of rta means the zodiacal belt

The whole hymo Rg. I. 164 is full of riddles. In Rg. I. 164. 2 it is said that seven borses aro yoked to a chariot (the Sun) that has only one wheel but three naves. The wheel means the year, tbree daves would be three seasons, summer. ralos, winter. The wheel is also said in verses 12 and 13 to have six spokes or five spokes; the twelve spokes or rims of wheel (pradhi) represent months.

divided into twelve parts ( dvādaśāra ). But it is a very difficult matter to keep in view the twelve divisions correctly. In Rg. I. 164. 15 it is said 'They say that the 7th of those that are born together is born of one; there are only six twin sages born of the gods'. Here there is a reference to seasons, six of which have two months each, the 7th has only one ( viz. 13th or intercalary month ) and that the 13th month is not fit for religious rites. The Atharvaveda V. 35. 4 708 also states that samvatsara has twelve spokes and the months have 30 spokes. This explains Rg. I. 164. 11-13 and 48. In the Brahmanas also the year is said to have 360 days and 720 days and nights together; Satapatha IX. I. 1. 43, Ait. Br. VII. 7 also say the 709 same. We have also to recognize that the Vedic saṁhitās and Brāhmaṇas speak of a 13th month that was intercalated. About Varuna the Rgveda says 710 'He knows the twelve months with their progeny (the days ) and also the month that is added.' The Tai. S. (IV. 6. 7. 1-2) refers to a year of twelve months and also of 13 months. The Kausitaki Br. 19. 2 speaks of the 13th month. The Tai. S. ( I. 14. 4, VI. 5. 3. 4 ) expressly mentions the 13th month called ' Samsarpa or Amhaspatya'. It is called Amhasaspati in Vaj.s, (VII. 30 and XXII. 31) and Samsarpa in Maitrāyani S. III. 12. 13. The Kausitaki Brāhmana connects the 13th month with the Sunāsiriya sacrifice. 11 The Maitrāyani Samhita (I. 10.8) draws a distinction between a stuyāji and cāturmāsya-yāji, the former being one who offers sacrifice thinking 'now Vasanta has started, rainy season has started, śarad has started while the

I.1. 43. Here the additional month is said to have been of 35days. This was probably another way of adjusting the Savana year of 360 days to the solar year of 365 days and about a quarter more. In six such years about 6 days for each year appear to bave been calculated and added as a 13th month of 35 days.

Cāturmāsya-yāji is one who offers sacrifice in view of the 13th month'. 711a How and when the month was inserted in the Rgveda times or the times of the Tai. S. is not clear. What is clear is that one whole month was added. Therefore, Thibaut overstates the case when he asserts emphatically (Grundriss p. 7) that all Vedic texts agree that the year was exclusively of 360 days. A year in which one month was added ( i. e. of 390 days) was also well-known to the Ṛgvedic Indians. Therefore, in order to explain the facts we have here probably to postulate two calendars, ons a purely sacrificial (or religious) of 360 days (12 months of 30 days ) probably inherited by the Vedic Indians from their ancestors about whom we know next to nothing, and another calendar where a month was added in order to bring the year in line with visible astronomical data. It is known that the ancient Egyptians 712 had an official calendar of 360 days ( 12 months of 30 days each ) plus five days added at end i. e. of 365 days only and no intercalary day was inserted in a year. The result was that the opening day of this calendar would shift back through the solar year until a whole cycle of that year had been completed in 1456 or 1506 years. This calendar called sliding calendar was in use for about 3000 years in Egypt from proto-dynastic period until the Roman period. There was also another calendar against which this sliding calendar moved. A year of 360 days ( divided into 12 months of 30 days each ) was not peculiar to ancient Vedic India nor to ancient Egypt, but played an important role also in Mesopotamia, which had a strictly lunar calendar. The co-existence of months of various

A, Parker (Chicago, 1953 ), where p. 56 says that from about 2500 B, C. Egyptians had three calendars all of which continued to be in use to the very end of pagan Egypt. 

Length of months in Vedic times 

491 

lengths for later times is vouchsafed by the Arthaśāstra p. 108 (Sham Shastri's ed. of 1919 ). A year of 360 days was in later times in India called a Sāvana one (from 'savana' meaning extracting of soma juice in a sacrifice ) and a month was added after about 30 months to bring the lunar year (of 354 days) in line with the solar year. 

In the Satapatha Brāhmaṇa (II. 1. 3. 2.) 713 the Sun's apparent passage for six months in the north and for six months in the south is referred to, though the word ayana is not employed in this passage. The word 'ayana' occurs in the sense of 'motion or path'in the Rgveda (āyan-n-āpo ayanam-icchamānāh, Rg. III. 33.7). Uttarāyaṇa and Dakṣiṇāyana in later literature mean no more than the sun's ( apparent) motion or path in the northern celestial sphere and in the southern sphere respectively. The Sun's movement in the north for six months and in the south for six months is mentioned in Br. Up. VI. 2. 15-16 also. Thibaut (Grundriss p. 10 para 6 ) cites Kausitaki Br. 19. 3 as stating that the Sun stands still after it has gone for six months towards the south in order to turn again to the north and then observes that no one has a right to assume, from this statement in the Kausitaki 714 Br. that for six months the Sun goes north or south, that the halves of the year are to be understood. What Thibaut is driving at is not clear to me. We have in this passage six months passages of the Sun in the north and also in the south. A year has ordinarily only twelve months. Therefore it must be assumed that halves of a year are meant. Thibaut does not explain what part of the year these six months in the north and south correspond to. Thibaut is probably swayed by the fact that in the Satapatha and elsewhere Vasanta, Grīsma and Varsā are lumped together as the seasons (rtus ) for the gods but Uttarāyaṇa does not exactly correspond with these three stus. That may be so, but the rule or maxim is that names are given on the basis of what is principal or eminent prādhānyena vyapadeśā bhavanti). Vasanta and Griṣma are important parts

of Uttarāyaṇa; therefore, by association with these two and for the sake of symmetry varṣā is also held to be a rtu for the gods. 

As regards the seasons, there are varying statements. In Rg. I. 15 the word 'stunā' occurs several times, but once we have * Itūn' also 'O Indra'drink Soma according to the seasons from the wealth (i. e. the richly filled vessel) of the brāhmapa.' Rg. II, 36 and 37 are styled Rtavya hymns. The Rgveda itself names five seasons, viz. Vasanta (X. 161. 4, X. 90.6), Grīṣma (X. 90.6), Prāvșs ( VII. 103.3 and 9 ), Sarad (over 25 times, as in II, 12, 11, VII. 66.11, X. 161.4), Hemanta ( X. 161.4), but the Rg. does not expressly mention Siśira. Three seasons are meta. phorically meant in Rg. I. 164. 48 and six in Rg. I, 164. 15. The Atharvaveda 714a ( VI. 55.2 ) mentions all the six, but not in the usual order. The Ait. Br. says that the year has five rtus 7 by putting together Hemanta and Siśira. The Maitrāyaṇi Sam, in I. 7. 3 speaks of Samvatsara as having five rtus and again as having six ftus and the Sat. Br. (II. 1.3.16 ) says that sam vatsara comprises six rtus. In Satapatha XII. 8.2.33 the ftus are said to be three viz. Grisma, Varsa and Hemanta and in the very next passage they are said to be sis. There is mention of seven stus in Atharvaveda VI. 61.2. But one should not be puzzled by this. The 7th ftu is probably meant to represent the 13th intercalary month as it is expressly mentioned in Atharva. (V.6.4). Thibaut surprisingly asserts that the lists of the names of the seasons are only priestly inventions and the Vedic texts exhibit no practical use for them (Grundriss p. 11). Thibaut appears to be obsessed with the influence of priests and offers no good reasons why the names should be regarded as inventions and not as correctly registering what was current in the then society. In Tai. S. 716 IV. 4.11.1 the six rtus with two months for each are mentioned. Vasanta is mentioned as the first of rtus (mukham vā etad-rtūnām yad-vasantaḥ) in Tai. Br. I. 1.2.6. The Satapatha 717 provides that Vasanta, Griṣma

and Varsā are the seasons of gods, Sarad, Hemanta and Sisira are seasons of the pitrs; similarly the bright half of a month, the day and the forenoon of a day are the times for gods and the dark half of a month, the night, the afternoon of a day are the times for pitrs and it winds up with the prescription that a brāhmaṇa should consecrate the sacred fires in Vasanta, a ksatriya in Grīsma and a vaiśya in Sarad. 718 At least as early as the edicts of Asoka the words 'varsa' (which etymo logically means 'rains') and 'samvatsara' are both used in the same sense viz, a year in the Brahmagiri inscription ( vide C. 

I. I. I. p. 175). 

There are Western scholars that deny the knowledge of the planets to the Vedic Indians. But Thibaut (Grundriss p. 6) and Kaye (p. 33 ) both concede that it is inconceivable that the Vedic Indians did not observe and distinguish at least the larger planets in early times, but they contend that the Vedic passages cited as proving knowledge of the planets on the part of Vedic Indians cannot be accepted as evidence of the record of observations about planets and that the mere mention of the number soven or five ( about Adityas in Rg. X. 72. 8-9 or oxen ) cannot be relied upon. Both Thibaut and Kaye approach these problems with a peculiar mentality. Their criticism is mainly destructive and has a flavour of special pleading against things and ideas Indian. They hardly ever propose their own explana tions of the disputed passages and when they rarely do they do not show how their explanations are more satisfactory than the ones they criticize. One typical case may be cited here. Almost all scholars agree that Krttikās are the same as Pleiades; but Kaye (Archaeological survey memoir No. 18 p. 24 and I. A. vol. 50, P. 45 ) appears to doubt this, yet he has not the goodness to say positively what other cluster Krttikās stand for and why. The principal reason for the paucity of references to planets probably 

718. Vide Prof. Renou's article on Vedic ștus' in Indian Culture, vol, 15 pp. 21-26, where he endeavours to establish that stu in the Rgveda bas do restricted sease but means simply time or suitable time for sacrifice or sometimes' rule or usage, and that'rtunā' or 'stubhiḥ' in the Rg. means 'according to the division or distribution. I demur to this conclusion. lo some passages tbe meaning of rtu would have to be 'season.': for ex. ample in Rg. I. 49,3 "O fair Usas !' winged birds, two-footed ( beings ) and four-footed (animals) go forth according the several seasons from the ends of the sky for thee (to meet thee)' (ar Taragott fyrto i 59 Since feats FTTETTII). Similarly, in Rg. 1. 95.3 ' \# would have no connection with distribution or division,

is that the cult of the worship of planets that we find well deve loped in Yāj. I. 295–308 had not yet arisen in Vedic times. At least Bṛhaspati (Jupiter ) appears to be clearly meant in two Vedic verses. 'Bṛahaspati, 719 first appearing in the highest heaven of the great Luminary ( the Sun), destroyed darkness &c;' 'Bșhaspati, when first appearing, rose in front of Tisya (Pusya ) constellation'. 'The seven 720 priests guard the dear and fixed seat of the bird (Agni) along with the five adhvaryus; oxen, going eat, ageless, delight in the east; the gods follow the ordi nances of gods' (Rg. III. 7.7.). Here the (five) oxen are taken to be the five planets. Similarly, 'He (Indra ) filled heaven and earth and the mid-region; he superintends in various ways the five gods, the 49 gods ( Maruts) at the proper seasons together with the thirty-four lights similar to his own but each accordiug to the different ordinances governing each'721 ( Rg. X. 55.3); 'these five oxen that stand in the midst of the great heaven' (Rg. I. 105. 10). Vena 722 may betaken to be the brilliant Venus in Rg. X.

721. आ रोदसी अपृणादोत मध्यं पञ्च देवाँ ऋतुशः सप्तसप्त। चतुत्रिंशता पुरुधा वि चष्टे Hallo lagi pada *. X. 55.3. The verse is rather enigmatic. It is in praise of Indra. The five gods are the planets that do not appear all at once but according to their respective seasons (F4-7:). The 34 lights are the San, Moon, the five planets and 27 naksatras, Ludwig and Oldenberg accept this interpretation. No other satisfactory explanation of 34 has been given by any one. 

722. SÆTI FITHUTHIRAIM 1197 : STAFI Trang tag 4: Happicant report Fa: 1 F. X. 123,5. In the first verse of this hymo Vena is described as w afug: i. e, surrounded by a sack of light as a foetus is surrounded by a sack and as pushing (towards earth) the waters that are in the bosom of the variegated one. Vena is called Randharva situated high 10 the heaven. Gandharva appears to have meant'any bright heavenly body.

123. 1 and 5 the latter of which may be translated as follows: 'The young lady (Uṣas or lightning ), approaching with a smile her lover, bears in the highest heaven Vena, the dear one, and she moves about, in the places of the dear (Vena) and sits down with him on a golden wing (a cloud)'. This would be a fine description of Venus rising in the east at dawn. 

About months a good deal would have to be said later on. The word is either 'mās' or 'māsa'. We have mās' in Rg. I. 25.8, IV. 18. 4, X. 52. 3 'He (Agni) appears every day and every month' and we have ‘māsa' in Rg. III. 31.9, V.78.9 (may the boy lying in the womb of his mother for ten months come out alive &c.), X. 184. 3. 'Mās' (the measurer) also means the Moon, as in æg. VIII. 94.2, X. 12,7 ( 'sūryo jyotir-adadbur-māsyaktūn,' the gods placed light in the Sun and darkness in the Moon), X. 64.3, X. 68.10, X, 92. 12, X. 93.5. The words 'mās' (moon) and 'māsa'(month ) are Indo-European, as variants of the same occur in many languages of the so-called Aryan family of languages. 

Naksatras have been a matter of serious discussions in numerous works. The word Naksatra' has in all three senses (1) star in general; (2) 27 equal parts of the zodiac; (3) asterism in the zodiacal belt ( which may each consist of one or more stars ). In my opinion the first and the 3rd are the most frequent meanings of the word in the Vedic samhitās. It may be that the zodiacal belt was divided into 27 equal parts called naksatras, but the easier, more natural and probably the earlier way was to mark some conspicuous star groups like Krttikās, Mrgaśiras and to refer to them as naksatras. The word 'naksatra' occurs frequently in the Rgveda and the other Samhitās and Brāhmaṇas; "the naksatras like thieves go away along with

nights ( to make room ) for the Sun that sees the world'723 (Rg. 1. 50.2); 'May the earth, the heaven, the waters, the Sun along with the naksatras and the wide sky listen to us' (Rg. III. 54. 19); 'he (Varuṇa ) urges on in two ways the big and high heaven ( the Sun) and naksatras and also spreads the earth' (Rg. VII. 86.1); 'when he ( the Sun) comes up, naksatras are not seen in the heavens, no one knows truly (how this happens )' Rg. X 111.7; 'The Adityas are strong through Soma, the earth is great through Soma and then Soma is placed in the lap of these naksatras' ( Ṛg. X. 85.2). In some passages like Rg. VII. 81.2 and X. 88. 13, it is difficult to say what 'naksatram 'stands for. Nakṣatra in most of the above passages means a star in general. But in Rg. X. 85.2 and in X 68.11 (the pitrs adorned the heavens with naksatras ) 723a naksatra appears to mean the 27 well-known asterisms. So also when the Satapatha contrasts the Krttikās ( that do not swerve from the east) with other nakṣatras (that do swerve), naksatra should be taken to mean asterisms in the Zodiacal belt, the 27 (or 28 ) constellations in the Zodiacal belt in which the moon appears to move. Another word is ' str' (that is an Indo-European word), which always occurs in the instrumental plural in the Rgveda (as in I. 68. 5, 1. 87. 1, I. 166. 11, II. 2. 5, II. 34. 2, IV. 7.3, VI. 49. 3 and 12 ) and is often con nected with decking the sky. The word 'rksa' in the sense of * star' occurs in Rg. 724 I. 24. 10 'these ṛksas that are established high up (in the sky ) are seen at night, but where did they go by day'. This refers to the constellation of the seven sages (Ursa Major). In the Atharvaveda VI. 40. 1, the constellation of the seven sages is expressly mentioned: "May Heaven and Earth confer on us freedom from danger here; may the Sun and the Moon do the same for us; may the wide mid regions confer on us freedom from danger and may there be abhaya for us on account of the oblation offered to the Seven Sages". The Satapatha states that the seven sages were formerly called 'ṛksāḥ' ( note 727 below). In Rg. V. 56. 3, VIII, 24, 27, VIII, 68. 15 the word rksa means either 'bear' or something else. It has been pointed out above p. 494 that in Rg. X.55.3 there is a reference to twenty-seven

naksatras.725 Apart from that the Rgveda mentions the naksatras Tisya ( as above) and Aghā and Arjuni 726 ( in Rg. X. 85. 13) which two latter correspond to Maghā and Phalgunis according to the Atharvaveda. It is possible to hold either that Agha and Maghā were names for the same nakṣatra in Rgvedic times or that Aghā was changed to Maghā by the time of the Tai. S. and the Atharvaveda hymns. If the latter alternative be accepted the change in the names of the two naksatras ( Agha and Arjunī) could not have taken place in a short time, but would require at least a hundred years between the time of Rg. X.85 on the one hand and Tai. S. and Atharva 19.7 on the other. This would strongly militate against Max Müller's assignment of two hundred years to the Samhitas which are purely hypothetical and the minimum dates ( vide Intro. p. XV to the 4th volume of his 4 volume ed. of the Rgveda ). Apart from Aghā and Arjuni which it is agreed are two of the 27 nakṣatras, it is probable that the Rgveda refers to Mrgaśiras, Punarvasu, Satabhiṣak and one or two more by name. The Nakṣatras are 27 or 28 (adding Abhijit after Uttarā 

725. For a myth about the disappearance of Abhijit from the list of naksatras, vide Vadaparva 230 2-11. There it is said tbat Abhijit, the younger sister of Rohini, coveted the position of eldership and went to a forest for practising tapas. Skanda was approached by the wives of sages, says Mārkandeya, and he said that he would consult Brahma. Then Brabmā arranged that time began with Dhanisthā and the Krttikās went to the heavens. This has been interpreted by modern writers on ancient Indian Astronomy to mean that the verpal equinox happened to be in the Kșttikās before the time of Yudhisthira and that Abhijit was accepted as one of the Dakṣatras. Vide J. of Ganganatha Jha R. I. vol. XIII at pp. 82-84 (by Prof. T. Bhattācbārya). With the greatest respect for the learned writer, I cannot accept all this. Discussion of his theory has to be given up for reasons of space.

X. 85 is a marriage hymn, referring to the myth of the marriage of Suryā, daughter of Savitr, to Soma, so this verse reference is made to the sending of presents (chiefly of cows, it seems ) 0o A bā i. e, Magbā naksatra and the taking away of the bride after marriage on Arjuni (i. e. Pūrvā or Uttarā Pbalguni) the next day or after one day more. The STATU (II. 1. 2. 10-11 ) asserts that Phalgunyah is the recondite pame of Arjuayaḥ. a in Rg. X. 85, 13 does not mean 'are killed' but 'are beated' or 'driven' (from the house of Şūrya's father to the house of the bridegroom). The Marathi equivalent'ETOTI means ' to beat or drive'. Vide 3114.

sādhā and before Śravaṇa in ancient authorities ). In the Vedic literature, Vedāngajyotisa and even in Yājñavalkya-sirti they are enumerated from Krttikā to Apabharani ( or Bharani ) while in works from the 3rd or 4th century A. D. and in modern times they are enumerated from Aśvini to Revati. 

It is time now to set out in a list the names of naksatras, deities governing them, their gender and the number of stars in each. There is some divergence of views as regards the names and the deities, which will also be pointed out in the appended table: complete lists occur in Tai. S. IV. 4.10. 1-3, Tai. Br. I. 5 and III. 1, Atharvaveda XIX. 7. 2-5, Kāthaka Samhita 39.13, Maitrāyaṇi Samhitā II. 13,20 and Vedānga-Jyotisa. For European equivalents of the Indian naksatras, vide Colebrooke in Asiatic Researches vol. IX chart opposite p. 322, Dikshit's Marathi work (2nd ed. p. 459 ) and Burgess in J. R. A. S. for 1893 p. 756. It is not unlikely that there is a veiled reference to Reyati, Punarvasū and Puṣya naksatras in æg. X. 119. 1-3728, and Rg. X. 86.22 appears to refer 729, as Tilak says in 'Orion'p. 166 ff., to the Mrgasiras naksatra; ‘Vrṣākapi 10 Indra! when you dashing upwards came to the house, where was that Mrga guilty of a good deal of sin, to whom did that Mrga, that confounds people, go? Indra is superior to all'. From Rg. I. 161.11 and 13 and IV, 33.7, Atharvaveda IV. 11.11 it appears that the dog-star (Sirius ) is referred to, and that twelve days were added at the end of the year during which the Rbhus slept or took rest or enjoyed the hospitality of the Sun.730 In Rg.

rājan bhisajaḥ sahasram' it is possible to see a reference to the Satabhisak naksatra of which Varuṇa is said be the devatā in the Tai. Br. III. 1, especially as in the following verse (ami ya ṛksā nihitāsa uccā ) there is a special reference to the Great Bear or to nakṣatras in general. 

Some remarks on the oakṣatras in general and on individual gaksatras would not be out of place. In the Atharvana Naksatrakalpa (the first of the Atharvaparisistas edited by Bolling and Negelein ) in chapter 4 verses 1-8 the devatās (deities) of the naksatras are given and chap, 2 states the number of stars in each nakșatra. In some Puranas also such as the Viṣṇud harmottara (J. 83. 13-21) the presiding deities of pakṣatras are set out. In the Bṭhat-sambitā Varāhamihira (chap. 97. 4-5) specifies the deities of the naksatras from Aśvini to Revati (including Abhijit ) as noted below. The Bṛbat-sambitā (96. 1-3), the Atharvaṇa-naksatra-kalpa (1, 2) and the Viṣṇud barmottara (I. 88 4-7) specify the number of single stars in each naksatra (which are from one to six ), those baving six stars being Krttikā, Āśleṣā and Magbā. Vide JASB, vol. 62 part 1 p. 14 where Hoernle gives a table, from a ms, of Puṣkarasāri's work, of Daksatras, the stars in each, the muhurtas, the gotra, devata of each. According to Hoernle the work is very old. Some notes are added on individual pakṣatras ( mentioned in the Vedic works ). Krttika-The Tai, Br, III. 1.4. 1 specifies the names of seven Kșttikās as Ambā, Dulā &c. Panioi refers to Ksitikā as Bahulā (in IV. 3. 34). J. C. Hickey in 'Introducing the universe' (pp. 119 120) says tbat persons of unusually keen 731 vision under favourable atmos. pheric conditions can see even eleven. Mrgasira-Tai. Br. III. 1. 4. 3 mentions both names viz, Mrgasirsa and Iovakā. Punarvasū—In the Kathaka and Mai. S. this is masculine singular ; Panini states (1. 2. 61 ) that in the Veda the word 'Punarvasu' is employed optionally in the singular (i. e. 

(Continued from last page) after having slept you asked this 'O Agohya (the Sun who cannot be cop: cealed by any one)! who is here that awakened us? The goat (the Sun) replied that the dog was the awakener at the end of year and that this was announced that day.' Tilak in Orion' (pp. 168 ff) explains at great length the meaning of these verses. Though one may not agree with every thing that he says, his main contentions seem to be probable.

sometimes in the dual, sometimes in the singular). Kālidā sa employs the dual Punarvasū ja Raghuvamsa XI. 36'gām gatāviva divah Punarvasū.' 

Tisya-Panini uses the word Tisya in I. 2. 63 and 3. 34 and the words Puṣya and Sidbya in the sense of 'on which undertakings prosper or succeed.' 

Phalguni-Pāṇini provides that the words Phalguni and Prosthapadā as naksatras are optionally used in the dual or plural, 

Nistya---Mai. S. shows that this is Deuter singular. Nistya in Rg. VI, 75. 19, VIII, 1, 13, X 133.5 appears to mean' outsider or outcaste', 

Visakha-Panini (I. 2. 62) provides that in the Veda 'Visakhā' is sometimes used in the singular, sometimes in the dual, wbile in bis day it was used in the dual. 

Anuradha-The mantra in Tai. Br. III. 1,2, 1 appears to use it as masculine plural. 

Rohini-Jyesthā is called Robini in Tai. S. and Tai, Br, (1,5). Jyesthā is styled Jyesthagbai in Atbarva VI. 110. 2. Vide note 753 below. 

Mula-In Tai, S, Vicrtau is used for Mūla, The Atharvaveda brings together Victau and Jyesthaghai in VI. 110. 2-3 and bas "Vicrtau dāma tārake' in II. 8, 1 and VI. 121. 3. In Rg. X, 87, 10 (tridbā nūlam yātudha pasya vȚśca ) Mūla means 'root, foot'. The word 'Mūlabarbana' occurs in Atharva VI, 110.2 and Mūlabarhani in Tai. Br. I. 5. 1. 4. 

Abhijit--not mentioned in Tai, S. and Kāthaka, though mentioned in Tai, Br., Atharva and Mai. S. It is sometimes mentioned in later works e. g, the Anuśāsanaparva ( 64. 5–35 ) mentions the consequences of gifts to brāhmaṇas on 28 naksatras from Kșttikā to Bharani. 

Śrona-Atharva calls it Sravana and Kathaka speaks of it as Aśvattba. In Pāṇini IV. 2. 22 Aśvattha is mentioned as a pakṣatra, The word Sroga in Rg. I, 112. 8 means 'lame or cripple'. 

Prosthapadā --Atharvaveda speaks of 'dvayā Prosthapada'. 

It would be noticed that some of the names of nakṣatras differ such as Inyakā (in Tai. Br. 1.5.1 and Kāthaka ) for Mrga śīrsa, Bāhū for Ardrā ( in Tai. Br. I. 5.1, Kāthaka S. and Maitrā. yani S.), Tiṣya for Pusya, Nistyā for Svāti (in Tai. Br.), Rohiṇi ( in Tai. Br. I. 5.4 and Tai. S.) for Jyesthā, Victau in Tai. S. for Mūla ( in other Vedic texts ), Sronā (in Tai. S., Tai. Br. and Mai. S.) and Aśvattha in Kāthaka S. for Śravana (in Atharva. ), Sravisthā for (medieval and modern ) Dhanisthā, Apabharani for Bharani (in Atharva., Mai. S. and modern times). The deities also differ, the most striking being the change of place between Bhaga and Aryaman as presiding deities of Āsādhās in the Kāthaka, Vedāngajyotisa, San 8!.. and Indra as deity of Citrā in Tai. S. and Tyastr in Tai. Br.

and Kathaka S., Pitarah as deity for Mūla in Tai. S. but Nirrti in almost all other texts; Indra as deity of Satabhisak in Tai. S. and Maj. S. but Varuṇa in Tai. Br. (III. 1.) and Kāthaka. Further, it was also specified whether a naksatra had only one star or had a cluster of two or three or more. Besides, the important point for consideration is; why does the Tai. S. differ from the Tai. Br. and Tai. Br. I. 5 from Tai. Br. III, 1 in the number of naksatras, in the names and the deities also of some of them. No satisfactory explanation can be given except this that the Tai. S. passage is earlier by some centuries than the Tai. Br. section (III. 1) or the Tai. S was composed in a country far away from the place where the Tai. Br. was composed. This latter does not appear to be probable since one part of Tai. Br. (1. 5) differs from another part (III. 1). The latter section speaks of a nakṣatra-isti in which oblations are offered to 28 naksatras ( including Abhijit ) and their deities (one naksatra being dealt with on each day from Krttikās) together with puronurūkyūs ( invitatory verses ) and yājyās (oblation verses ) which are different for each naksatra. The first fourtoon naksa tras from Kṛttikā (up to and including Viśākhā) are called Devanaksatras and the fourteen naksatras from Anūrādhā to Apabharaṇi or Bharani are cālled Yamanaksatras. After Viśākhā, the Tai. Br. (Naksatresti) inserts Paurṇamāsi with appropriate puronuvākyā and yājyā verses and after apabharani an offering to Anāvāsyā with a puronuvākyā (which is the verse 'Nivesani sangamani vasūnām' Tai. S. III. 5.1.1) and a yājyā ( which is the verse "yat te devā adadhur', Tai. S. III. 4. 1. 1). Besides, it was laid down that the sacrificer had to invoke gods in the sacrifice by a name ( to be kept secret) derived from the presiding deity of the naksatra on which he was 732 born ( i. e. if

I should like to place it pot later than 8th century B.C. for several reasons. If the observation referred to above (p.496) about krttikās were made about 12th century B.C. (14th century B.C. as some scholars hold) and if 400 or 300 B.C, was accepted as the date of the Vedangajyotisa, it would have to be supposed that the writer of it either did not notice (or purposely ignored ) the fact that winter solstice had shifted about 11 or 12 degrees from the originally observed position. This is rather difficult to believe A difference of four or five degrees may not be dwelt

born on Kṛttikā, then some name like Agnimitra &c., if on Pusya, Brhaspatinitra &c.). 

If the naksatras ( 27 or 28 ) had been borrowed at one time en bloc from a foreign source the divergences in the names of the naksatras, in the presiding deities, and in the gender and number should ordinarily not have arisen to the extent they do. But, if they were an indigenous growth then differences of opinion would naturally have been evolved in the passage of centuries. The only asterisms first specialised and named in Greece and Syria were the Pleiades in Job. 38. 31, Homer and Hesiod; Orion in Job. 39.31, Homer and Hesiod; Arcturus in Job. 9.9 and in 39.32, Homer and Hesiod; the great Bear in Homer and Hesiod, Aldebaran in Homer and Hesiod and three more including Sirius (videDawn of Astronomy' by Norman Lockyer, 1884 p. 33). This is several centuries later (if not thousands) than the early Vedic texts wherein the whole scheme of naksatras appears. 

Further details contained in the Tai. Br. and Baudhāyana śrauta-sūtra ( 28, 3–4 ) are not set out here. The Naksatresti in the Tai. Br. (III. 1 ) has been competently dealt with by Prof. Paul Emile Dumont in the Proceedings of the American Philoso phical Society, vol. 98, No. 3 ( 1954 ) with text, English transla tion and notes. The naksatras had been closely observed and many legends arose from imaginary resemblances of star groups to certain familiar animals and also fanciful interpretations of the constellations observed in the sky. The naksatras were closely concerned not merely in a religious rite called Nakṣatresti, but they were of prime importance in the basic srauta rite, viz. consecration of the sacred fires (Agnyādhāna). In the Satapatha Brāhmaṇa (II. 1. 2 ) reference is made to several naksa tras from Kittikā onwards together with their presiding deities as being fit for Agnyadhāna (viz. Krttikā, Rohini, Mrgaśīrsa, Pūrvā Phalguni, Uttarā Phalguni, Hasta, Citrā). The Tai. Br. recom monds spring, summer and sarad for Agnyādheya in the case of 

(Continued from last page) upon. Besides, the facts that the Baudhāyana-srauta-sūtra has a similar passage, that Kautilya follows the five year cycle and says that there is ad intercalary month at the end of 27 years and another intercalary month at the end of the cycle of Ave years (11.2 on p. 109 ) and the fact that the Mahābhārata (Virātaparva 52.3-5) speaks of adding two intercalary months every five years rather suggest an earlier date for the Vedānga-Jyotisa.

brāhmana, ksatriya or vaiśya sacrificer respectively. The Satapatha appears to condemn setting up of sacred fires in relation to naksatra alone and recommends that Agnyādheya should be performed on the New Moon of Vaiśākha on which there is Rohini naksatra ;732a but these rules did not apply when a person had resolved upon performing Soma sacrifice and he should not in that case stop to consider the season or naksatra 

Very interesting information and legends are given in the Vedic texts about some of the naksatras. About the Kṛttikās the Satapatha Brāhmaṇa733 states other naksatras contain one star, or two or three or four stars, but these Kșttikās are many; the sacrificer reaches plenty; therefore one should set up sacred fires on the Krttikās. These ( Krttikās) indeed do not swerve from the east, while all other naksatras do swerve from the eastern direction.' The recondite allusion in Rg. I. 164, 33 (atra pitā duhitur-garbham-ādhāt) and X. 61.7 (pitā yat svām duhitaramadhiskan) are developed into a myth, a lengthy account of which is given in the Ait. Br. XIII. 10 and Satapatha I. 6. 2. 1-4 (Prajāpati approached his daughter, some say the heaven and others say it was Uṣas &c.) and about Rohini, Mrga, the Mrgavyādha (Sirius) and the three stars in the belt of Orion. Prajāpati 734 is said to have had 33 daughters which he gave in marriage to king Soma, who was fond of Rohiṇi and on account of that suffered from Rājayakṣman (Tai. S. II. 3. 5. 1). 

Why the naksatra lists begin with the Krttikās in the Vedic Literature and why with Aśvini in classical Sanskrit literature can be explained only on astronomical considerations. The ver

It should be noted that the present tense ( cyavante ) is used here, whence it follows that this passage was composed when the position of the Krttikās on the equator was an observed fact and their declination was nil.

nal equinox was in Kṛttikā about 2300 B. C. Instead of admit ting this as a probable date for the Vedic works, Fleet boldly asserts that the list of naksatras beginning with Krttikās has no basis in fact, but belongs entirely to ritual and astrology (JRAS for 1916 p. 570 ). No detailed arguments are deemed necessary. Fleet does not specify cogent evidence, nor does he assign reasons why priests later on changed the beginning of the list from Krttikā to Aśvini, nor does he vouchsafe how the list of naksatras in the Vedic age began in fact for ordinary folk if the Kṛttikā list was a pure priestly invention. Even Thibaut (in I. A. vol. 24 at p. 100 ) had to admit that the begin. ning of the naksatra series with Krttikā instead of with Aśvini seriously affects Max Muller's assignment of 1500 B. C. to 800 B. C. to the Vedic period. In the Tai. S. VII. 4. 8 there is a discussion about the time for undergoing the diksā in a Sāmvat sara-satra'. 735 It is proposed there that the dikṣā may be performed on the Full Moon in Phalgunī because that is the beginning of the year; then an objection is raised against this and it is pro posed that the dikṣā may be taken on Full Moon in Citrā, because that was the beginning of the year. If the year began with the winter solstice in those days this reference would have to be placed at 4000 or 6000 B. C. This passage probably embodies traditions that the year began in different months in different periods of antiquity. 

Great controversies have raged over the question whether the Indian naksatras are indigenous or were borrowed from some other people. The great French astronomer Biot held that Indians borrowed the naksatra system from the Chinese and Whitney followed Biot. There were others who held that Indians borrowed thom either from the Babylonians or the Arabs. I cannot enter here into the merits of these discussions. The Arabs them selves admit that they borrowed their astronomy from Indian Siddhantas and there is hardly anything to show that they know the complete naksatra system as early as at least 1500 B. C. Therefore, we may leave the Arabs out of account altogether ( vide Thibaut in Grundriss p. 14). Great scholars are often blinded by prejudices and shut their eyes to basic facts. The Chinese system of Sieu had at first only 24 and then it became one

of ( it is said ) 28 at about 1100 B. C. ( as said by Thibaut in Grundriss p. 13.) There are no clear traces in the Vedic texts that nakṣatras were held to be ?during the times of those texts. We should not accept at their face value the assumptions of the antiquity of astronomy in China that are sometimes advanced (vide' East and West', Rome, vol. VI. p. 288.) Besides, neither in Babylonia nor in China were the asterisms thoroughly integrated with the religious system. In Vedic times one was not entitled to perform solemn sacrifices unless he had already set up sacred fires on certain naksatras. Further, the months (Māgha, Phālguna, Caitra &c.) were named after certain naksatras and exist only in Sanskrit, not in Greek, Latin or Chinese. The deities that were deemed to preside over the naksatras from such ancient days as those of the Tai. S. and Tai. Br. are almost all of them exclusively Vedic and have no counter parts in Babylonia or China. Besides, though thousands of cuneiform tablets have been found in Babylonia no one has, so far as I know, pointed to a single tablet where all the naksatras appear in an orderly series of 27 or 23, as we find in Vedic Samhitās. It is at least clear that long before the Taittirfya Samhitā the Vedic people had fixed the number of the naksatras (at 27 or 28 ), their names and order and their presiding deities and had made the naksatras a most integral part of their sacri. ficial system. Furthermore, almost all of the Indian names of naksatras are siginficant or have ancient legends connected with them. For example, Ārdrā means 'wet'and the naksatra was call od Ārdrā because when the sun was in it rains set in. Punarvasu was probably so called because the grains of paddy or barley sown in the ground sprout up as new wealth after being buried; Pusya, was so called because the young sprouts grow and become nourished;Ā.śreṣā or Āślosā, because the grown-up plants of paddy or barley grow high enough to embrace each other; Maghā, be cause the paddy or other plants are putting forth the standing crop which is wealth in itself; Krttiki, because they (being six or seven ), look like the skin of the spotted deer on which a religious student was to sit for Vedic study. In these circum stances the burden to prove borrowing of the nakṣatra system by Indians was very heavy on those who affirmed it. What is the evidence? There is very little evidence except prejudice and speculation. The main tangible evidence they can and do rely on is that the Chinese or Babylonians had also 28 pakṣatras as the Indians had. But these scholars, though very learned and far seeing in their own way, never stopped to consider how from 

510 





China and Babylon the naksatras could reasonably be supposed to have been derived by Indians more than 3500 years ago (on a most modest estimate) and allowed to be the very centre and basis of their religion of sacrifices, what were the means for the communication of the thoughts and ideas underlying the naksatra system and why one may not surmise that the real state of things was the other way about (viz. the Babylonians and Chinese derived the system from the ancestors of Indians ) or that all systems were derived from a common prehistoric source. Another reason for discounting the theories of Biot, Weber and Whitney may also be advanced viz. the researches of Tilak in his 'Orion' (particularly pp. 61-95) and of Prof. Jacobi have at least made this clear that the Krttikā series is not the oldest arrangement of the naksatras known to Indians, but that the Indians had once an older arrangement, which plac ed Mļgaśirsa at the vernal equinox. Those who are interested in these somewhat novel and rather barren controversies raised by Biot, Weber and others may read Weber's 'der vedischen Nachri chten von den Nakṣatras', two volumes, I. A. vol. 23 pp. 154-159 (Jacobi on the date of the Rgveda'), pp. 238–249 (Bühler's note on Jacobi's theory and Tilak's Orion, 1. A. pp. 85-100 (Thibaut on ‘antiquity of Vedic civilization') and pp. 361-369 (Whitney), I. A. 48 pp. 95–97. The word 'naksatra' is derived by Yaska 736 from the root 'nakṣ' meanicg 'to go', while the Śatapatha Br. (II. 1. 2. 17-18) and Tai. Br. II. 7. 18 derive it as from na plus kṣatra and Panini (VI. 3.75) accepts this derivatior. The word 'naksatra'(m) is applied even to the Sun in Rg. VI. 67. 6. Tai. Br. teaches how one is to mark the naksatra on which one has to perform a religious act, viz. he should mark about dawn and before the first rays light the sky the part of the sky where the naksatra appears and when the sun appears the nakṣatra would be to the west of the sun, at which time he should perform what he has to do. It is stated that sage Matsya established into eminence Yajñesu and Satadyumna by this method (Tai, Br. I. 5. 2.1.).

indeed never sets nor rises. When people think that he (the Sun) sets what happens is he reaches the end of the day, reverses himself, creates night below and day above. When people think that he rises in the morning, that means that having reached the end of the night he reverses himself, makes day below and night above. He indeed never sets'. This is in very interesting contrast to the Jaina view in Sūryaprajñapti of two suns and two moons or the viow of Heraclitus in Greece ( 6th century B. C.) that a new sun was born and died every day ( Eisler p. 42.) 

In the Brāhmaṇa period Indians had 737a found out the day called Visuvat or Visuva which is said to be in the middle of the sacrificial year) when the day and night were of equal length: 'As a person fastens the two wings or sloping sides of a hall (or shed) to the bamboo ridge or beam that is in the middle of the shed ), so people use the Divākīrtya day for stret ching across the two sides ( half years)'. 

I have purposely devoted some space to the subject of the astronomical knowledge of people in the Vedic age. Several European scholars that have written on the astronomical achievements of ancient and medieval India, have indulged in very disparaging and contemptuous statements about Indians

not only in astronomy, but generally. To take only one or two instances. Thibaut (Grundriss p. 3 ) is pleased to observe that what Indians knew before Greek influence is not much and is of a primitive character. This is how Whitney, a learned American scholar of Sanskrit, unburdens himself; 'there can be no question that, from what we know in other respects of the character and tendencies of the Hindu mind, we should not at all look to find the Hindus in possession of an astronomical science possessing so much of truth. They have been from the beginning distinguished by a remarkable inaptitude and disin clination to observe, to collect facts, to record, to make inductive investigations' (J. A. O. S. vol. VI p 471). His coadjutor, Mr. Burgess, differed from him even in regard to astronomy (ibil. pp. 477–480 ). 

One is tempted to return Whitney's compliments to Indians in the same coin by saying that for 1400 years from Ptolemy, the ancestors of Whitney and other highbrows hardly ever made any discovery of astronomical importance, stuck unthinkingly and slavishly to the Almagest and were literally in the dark about the true astronomical position during what are often called the Dark Ages of Europe. Even Luther who rebelled against the authority of the Pope denounced Copernicus as a fool, charged the latter with turning upside down the science of astronomy and relied upon the Bible, which, he said, declared that Joshua commanded the Sun to stand still and not the Earth (Joshua 10. 12). This betrays the old mentality that if there is a contradiction between the words of the Bible and Nature, the believers in Scripture must correct their ideas of Nature in accordance with the Bible and not the Bible in accordance with what is found to be Nature. This also reminds one of the maxim of the Pūryamimārsā that there is nothing too heavy for a sacred text. 

I should request all Western authors interested in Indology and dazzled by some writings of a few Greeks to ponder deeply over the following words of Sir Norman Lockyer in his 'Dawn of Astronomy' (1894) 'Anaximander told us that the earth was cylindrical in shape and every place that was then known was situated on the flat end of the cylinder; and Plato, on the ground that the cube was the most perfect geometrical figure, imagined the earth to be a cube, the part of the earth known to the Greeks being on the upper surface. In these matters the vaunted Greek mind was little in advance of the predecessors 

Unpardonable omissions by Western writers 

513 

of the Vedic priests' (p. 8). If the Greeks forged ahead in one or two branches, there were several other peoples in the world that far surpassed them in other equally important matters. I would also recommend to them to read carefully what Sarton says in his Preface (p. IX) to 'A history of Science' where he charges Western writers with unpardonable omissions viz. ignoring the scientific efforts of Egypt, Mesopotamia and other countries and assuming childishly that science began in Greece and secondly hiding the superstitions which surrounded eminent Greeks. Writers at least in the 19th and 20th centuries should have no reason to run down one people and praise to the skies another people, but their endeavour should be to arrive at well documented, well-balanced, impartial and cautious judgments upon the achievements of ancient peoples of the world. 

The chronology of the Vedic age is far from certain. Jacobi, Dikshit, Tilak and some others would put the Vedic age back to 4000 B. C. or even earlier. Winternitz puts it as far back as 2500 B. C.; while Max Müller and following him many Western scholars would thrust all Vedic Literature between 1500 to 800 B.O. Even taking these latter timings the Vedic Litera. ture shows a good deal of progress in astronomical matters which Indians could not have owed to Greece. There is no extant literature in Greece that can be placed earlier than about 900'or 800 B. C. with certainty. The Homeric poems and the works of Hesiod are the oldest surviving literary writings in Greek. Homer mentions the Sun, the Moon, the morning and evening star, the Pleiades, Hyades, Orion, Great Bear, Sirius (Orion's Dog), Bootes (Arcturus) and Hesiod mentions practi cally the same stars as Homer; Hesiod says that spring began Bixty days after winter solstice, puts down moon's period at thirty days, but does not mention equinoxes.738 It should be noted that Vedic astronomy several centuries (if not thousands of years) earlier than Homer and Hesiod was at least as advanced as that in the two Greek authors. The very ancient peoples (besides Indians and Chinese ) are the Egyptians, the Babylonians, the Hittites and Chaldeans. About the Egyptians, the Cambridge Ancient History (vol. II p. 218) states that there is very little trace of the application of Mathematics to Astro

nomy in Egypt and that, though the length of the solar year had been fairly accurately determined, this was done by observation of the heliacal rising of Sirius or Sothis which happened to correspond rather closely with the first rise of the Nile and involved no calculation whatsoever. About Hittites and Chaldeans there is not much to be said as no one asserts that naksatras were borrowed from them. Even about 800 B.C. Homer's and Hesiod's knowledge of astronomy was meagre. Even Hipparchus, regarded as the greatest astronomer of anti quity who completed his catalogue about 130 B. C., had access to a continuous series of observations made in Mesopotamia reaching back to 747 B. C.73a Ptolemy wrote about 150 A. D.; his Almagest is based on the observations of Hipparchus, and almost all that is known about the predecessors of Ptolemy is derived from the latter's work, as, owing to the very excellence of Ptolemy's work, all writings of his predecessors ceased to be studied and have not been recovered. The theory of Greek influ ence in astrology will be dealt with a little later on, but a fow words may be said here about the supposed influence of Greek astronomy on the Indian Siddhāntas739 and later works.

C.), from which date the observations continued till Ptolemy's day; vide Heath's 'Greek Astronomy' p. XIV and pp. 142–143.

XLVII at p. 671 appears to have done the same before him, Sarton ( in JAOS vol, 75 No. 3 p. 169 ) supports Prof. Neugebauer, though he admits that some of the Babyloniao observations made it easier for Hipparchus to discover precession of equinoxes.

It is said here that meat and he were commented upon by greca, that the Sūryasiddhānta is most accurate, Paulisa is accurate and Romaka approaches it in accuracy and that Vāsistba and Pitāmaha are far from accurate, Thibaut (io Iotro, to Tar PP. XLIX-L) bolds tbat Paulisa-siddbānta known to Utpala (about 966 A D.) was different from the one known to Varābamibira, that both Romaka and Pauliśa known to Varāba could not be placed later than 400 An De (latro. p.

Greek influence and Siddhāntas 

515 

first place no Indian work of the Siddhānta class admits that any Yavana knowledge was at the basis of the Indian astronomy nor do these ancient Sanskrit works on astronomy set out any large number of purely astronomical terms of Greek origin as Varāha does in astrology. The subjects to be dealt with in the Pañcasid dhāntikā are set out in chap. I. verses 5-and there is hardly any word therein that can be said to be originally Greek, Reliance is placed by Weber and others on the fact that two of the five Siddhāntas the characteristics of which are sum marised by Varāhamihira in his Karaṇa740 called Pañca siddhāntikā are designated Romaka and Paulisa and it is argued that this clearly suggests Greek influence. One should like to know the nuinber of purely Greek astronomical words employed in the Siddhāntas (older than Varāha) and different from the 36 or 37 Greek words said to have been employed in Sanskrit astrology by Varāha and others. Conceding for argument that Romaka stands for the Alexandrian school that does not prove Greek influence on the Siddhāntas. There is hardly any evidence to show that any medieval work or calendar in India followed or was based mainly upon the data of the Romaka,741 The length of its year is 365 days, 5 hours, 55 minutes and 12 seconds which exactly agrees with the deter mination of the extent of the year given by Hipparchus and accepted by Ptolemy (Thibaut in Grundriss p. 42). The rules set up by Varāha for ahargaṇı according to Romaka give results for the meridian of Yavanapura (and not for that of Ujjayini). It did not occur to any Western scholar so far that the Romaka-siddhānta being in Sanskrit was most probably Composed by some Greek 742 settled in India familiar with 

740. Difference is made between a siddhānta work and a karana. The latter is a compendious astronomical work which does not discuss astrono mical theories at length (as the siddbāntas do ) and furoishes a set of concise and approximately correct rules for the quick performance of the more important astronomical computatioos. 

741. Not only was the Romaka not followed, but a comparatively early writer Brahmagupta (boro 598 A, D.) condemns it as beyond the pale of Biurtis: युगमन्वन्तरकल्पाः कालपरिच्छेदकाः स्मृतावुक्ताः। यस्मान रामके ते स्मृतिबाहो TAPAHIT I EE I. 13 quoted by S. B. Dikshit io I. A vol. 19 pp. 133-142, where Mr. Diksbit contends that the Romaka summarised in the Pañcasiddhaotikā is different from the Romaka of Sriṣeṇa and that the former was composed before 150 A D. 

742. The Paulisa-siddhānta is supposed by Weber to have been borrowed from Paulus Alexandrinus (4th century A. D.). Kern (preface

Sanskrit as well as with the Greek or Alexandrian astronomy that preceded Ptolemy and probably oven Hipparchus and that therefore Varāha gave a summary of it in his karaṇa, just as in his famous work on Astrology, the Brhajjātaka, he mentions the views of the Yavanas and frequently differs from them. 'Further Varāha is generous in his appreciation of Greek astrology 743 "Yavanas are indeed Mlecchas and this śāstra is well cultivated (or established) among them; even they (the Yavanas) are honoured as if they were sages.

of 'horā-śāstra'. But Varāha nowhere pays a similar compliment to Yavanas about their proficiency in Astronomy and Mathe matics. This would suggest that in astronomy he did not tate them high or did not think they had anything special to impart to Indians or at least he did not base his astronomical theories on the works of Greek astronomers. He hardly ever employs any Greek words that are not already employed in his work on astrology. 

· Thibaut (Grundriss, p. 42 ) holds that the name Pulisa has decidedly a non-Indian appearance. One fails to understand why these learned writers are so positive about a certain name being non-Indian. We have in Sanskrit such ancient names as Pulastya, 744 Pulaha, Paulastya (for Kubera ) which contain most of the elements of the word Pulisa and are very similar to 

it. 'Even in these days Hindus bear such names as Nabobsingh. The siddhantas are called Paitāmaha and Paulisa because they were deemed to have been composed by Pitāmaha and Puliśa. Alberuni, Thibaut says, traces the name Puliśa to a Greek author Paulus; but Alberuni who was familiar with both Indian and Greek authors might have committed a mistake, as even such a scholar as Weber, whose vast reading and pheno monal industry are a marvel, was misled by mere similarity in name and one recalls what was said in the drama Sakuntala by the attendant of Sakuntalā's little son that the child was misled by the similarity of names. Thibaut himself admits that it cannot be proved that the Paulisa siddhānta is related to the work of the Greek astrologer Paulus. Paulisa-siddhānta appears to have restricted itself mostly to astronomical matters. We have seen (p. 488) that the Paitamaha-siddhānta was composed about 80 A. D. Therefore, that Siddhānta could not have borrowed anything from Ptolemy ( 150 A. D.). Prof. Neugebauer again has 744a no doubt that the original impetus to scientific Hindu

astronomy came from Hellenistic astronomy, since he thinks that the use of the eccentric-epicyclic model alone is sufficient proof. But he is inclined to hold that the period of reception lies between Hipparchus and Ptolemy and hopes that a systematic study of Hindu astronomical works might reveal information about pre-Ptolemaic Greek astronomy no longer preserved in available Greek sources. It is doubtful whether that hope will ever be fulfilled. If ancient Indians were capable of analysing the elements of the Sanskrit language and raising such a system as Pāṇini's, if they could plumb the depths of the human mind and create a mental discipline like the Yoga, if they carefully noted centuries before Christ the parts of the glottis and other organs in the mouth in the production of the letters of their language and produced the Prātiśākhyas and Siksā works, if they could create a fable literature and invent the game of chess and make a gift of these two to the whole of mankind, if their knowledge of Algebra was of a superior order (vide Colebrooke's Essays, vol. II, at p. 446 and Cajori's 'a History of Elementary Mathematics' pp. 93-101), if they invented the decimal place value 7142 system for numbers and propagated it and the sign for a zero to Europe through the Arabs in the 12th century A. D., there is hardly any compelling reason for saying that it would not have been possible for them to arrive at their own eccentric and epicycle system (of which Prof. Neugebauer makes so much) independently of any other people to explain the

S. vol. 70 (1950) p. 7 admits that scholars are very far from a real insight into the development of Hellenistic astronomy before Ptolemy. In his review of the work on Indian studies by Professors Repou and Filliozat Prof. Neugebauer seems to bold that the discussion of Greek influence on Hindu astronomy and mathematics is of very little interest, since most of the Greek material was well known in Mesopotamia in the middle of the 2nd millenium 

B, C. and might have spread from Mesopotamia towards the east (vide ‘Archives Internationales d'Histoire des Sciences' for April-June 1955 at p. 170).

With them each position counted for 60 and not for ten. 123 in our decimal place value system is equal to 1 x 10' + 2 x 10' plus 3 A similar o in Mesopotamia would give 60% + 2 x 60' plus 3 = 3723. For numbers below 60 the notation was clumsy as a dividing line bad to be used for the teas and integers. 

Indian Astronomy and Greek influence

supposed motions of the Sun, the Moon and the planets round the earth. 

One more observation must be made here. The Vedānga Jyotiṣa 745 says 'The sun and the moon start towards the north in the month of Māgha at the beginning of Sravisthā (i. e. Dhanisthā) and the Sun starts towards the south in the middle of Āśleṣā in the month of Srāvana' i. e. winter solstice was in the beginning of Dhanisthā. In the Bșhatsanhitā Varāhamihira tells us that in his day the two ayanas of the Sun took place at the beginning of Karkataka and of Makara respectively, that indeed at some time in the past Uttarāyana began at the beginning of Dhaniṣthā and dukṣiṇāyana commenced in the middle of Āślesā and that therefore it was so declared in former śāstras. This shows that, between about 505 A. D. when Varāha planned and probably wrote his Pañca-siddhāntikā and the observation contained in the Vedānga-Jyotisa, the commen. cement of Daksināyana had shifted from the middle of Aslesā to the last quarter of Punarvasu i. e. in all about 23 degrees and 20 minutes. Varāhamibira makes no effort to explain this. It is therefore quite reasonable to argue that he was probably not aware of the theory of the procession of the equinoxes. Autho rities are not in complete agreement as to the yearly extent of precession. Taking it at 50.2 seconds per year, the total number of years between Varāba and the date of the observation in Vedānga Jyotisa would be about 1673 and deducting 505 years (the time of Varāha's epoch for a siddhānta calculation) the observation would refer itself to about 1168 B. C. If Varāha and his prede cessors had borrowed scientific astronomy directly from the Greeks, they should have been quite aware of the precession of

equinoxes, since procession is said to have been discovered by Hipparchus, and was adopted by Ptolemy.7454 

This consideration bas special force in view of the fact that Varāha believed that the constellation of the Saptarsis ( Ursa Major) was in the Maghās at the time when Yudhisthira ruled, that that star group remains for one hundred years in each of the 27 naksatras and that therefore to complete one cycle through all naksatras the star group of Saptarsis required 2700 years.746 

There are other serious difficulties also in holding that the Sanskrit scientific astronomical treatises were acquainted with or borrowed from Ptolemy's work, Numerous discrepancies in essen tial matters exist between Ptolemy's work and Hindu astronomical works such as the assignment of different dimensions to the epicycles of the planets by Ptolemy and by Hindu writers. There fore, it is altogether improbable that the Hindu works were directly based on Ptolemy's work. Nor is there any direct evidence to show that Hindu works were based on Hipparchus or the works 

745 a. Vide 'Greek Astronomy' by Heath p. 611 and Prof. Neuge. bauer in Journal of Near Eastern Studies, vol. IV. p. 24. In the: Poona Orientalist vol. VIII. pp. 68-80 Mr. Raja Rao endeavours to prove that ancient Pravargya legend is based on a knowledge of the precession of the equinoxes. In the first place, too much has to be taken for granted to make that thesis probable and in the 2nd place it would have to be admitted that precession, though kpown in the Vedic age, was forgotten before the times of Varā bamihira who is apparently not aware of it. ; Prof. K. V. Abhyankar (in Dhruva commemoration vol. III. pp. 155-164) tries to show that 'precession of the equinoxes' had been discovered in India in ancient times, but his arguments are far-fetched and not at all convincing.

of other Greek writers. No such Greek works are now available nor are even Greek elementary manuals of astronomers available which can be said to agree with Hindu scientific works. That an extensive Sanskrit literature on astronomy has perished is clear from Varāba-mihira's works and Utpala's quotations in his commentaries on the Bṛ. S. and Bṛhaj-jātaka. Modern Western writers would do well to observe at least for the present a non-committal attitude instead of repeating ad nauseum that Hindu scientific astronomy was derived from Greeks on slender similarities between the two systems and on obscure and ill understood passages and extracts in old astronomical works (vide E. Burgess in J. A. O. S. vol. VI at p. 480). 

After having briefly indicated the astronomical knowledge to be gathered from Vedic works, it is now necessary to show that astrological knowledge is also found in the Vedic texts from the oldest times. The human mind is very curious to know the future and is very prone to regard certain days, times and appearances as auspicious or favourable and others as inauspici ous. Various means were adopted by ancient peoples to pry into the future. The word astrology is now generally understood747 to mean the predictions about what would befall an individual based on the configurations of the Sun, the moon and the planets at the time of his birth. But this was not the sense or at least the only sense in which the word was used in very ancient times. Astrology known to us from the ancient Assyrians was concerned almost wholly with the interpretation of celestial phenomena and planetary configurations and the predictions about the immediate future in relation to the country, its people, its government or king, in such matters as the crops, floods, storms, invasions or other calamities. The events in the heavens, in the sky and even on the earth were supposed to intimate the thoughts of the gods, and to convey indications about impending happenings. This may be called natural astrology. Horoscopic astrology is a later development. Predictions were also derived by skilled diviners from various other happenings such as dreams, the flight and cries of birds, and the interpretation of the mysterious signs on the livers 748 of the sheep killed in sacrifices to gods in Babylon and Rome.

The first thing that we notice is that even in the Rgveda we have frequent references to 'auspiciousness of days' (sudinatve ahnām) in Rg. III. 8.5, III. 23.4, VII. 88.4, X. 70.1, (sudinatvam. ahnām' in Rg. II. 21. 6 and 'sudinesvahnām' in Rg. IV. 37.1). A few of these may be translated here. 'O Indra! establish amongst us abundance of wealth, freedom from injury to our bodies, sweetness of speech and luckiness of days' (Rg. II. 21.6); '(The sacrificial post) when planted on an auspicious day goes prospering in the sacrifice attended by many men'(Rg. III. 8.5 ); 

(Continued from last page) have been developed in India. Vide 'Hepatoscopy and Astrology in Babylonia and Assyria', a paper in the Proceedings of the American Philoso phical Society, vol. XLVII, pp. 646-676. Divination is either voluptary or involuntary. In the former marked arrows were used ( apparently referred to in Ezekiel 21. 21 ) or birds were sent out and the directions in which they flew were noted and interpreted or such things as dipping buds or flowers in water and placing them at the feet of the images of gods in India and noting whether the flowers on the right or left side fell down first. Involuntary divination depends on all kinds of sigas, phenomena and happenings that force themselves on one's attention such as aspects of the sun, the moon, planets, lightoing and clouds, dreams, chirping of birds and falling of lizards on one's body and the like. The Babylonian and Assyrian priests attached to temples made very extensive collections of omens and portents, but the interpretations almost exclusively concerned general welfare (viz. crops, pestilence, war, famine, plenty &c.) and if an individual was referred to it was only the king. The theory uoderlying hepatoscopy was that the animal offered was assimilated to the deity and the soul of the animal entered into the inner being of the god. The seat of life and of the soul was supposed to be the liver. The chief parts of the liver were the right and left lower lobes. Among the Romans the heart and lungs also were examined, the right representing the favourable side and left the unfavourable side. The priests did not besitate to apnounce to the king unfavourable results and applied their systems consistently. Astrology represented a comparatively more scientific view of the universe. The planets came to be regarded as gods even in the oldest astrological texts in which the five planets were identified with the chief gods of the Babylonian pantheon, viz. Jupiter with Marduk, Venus with Ishtar, Saturn with Ninib, Mercury with Nebo and Mars with Nergai, Jupiter (=Marduk p. 654) being always mentioned first. It was believed that through the planets and stars one can see gods at worko Prognostications varied according to the season or month of the year and the day. The Greek astrology offered a great contrast to the Babylonian, siace in the former the individual came to be all in all. The Greek astronomers obtained from the Babylonians the names for the constellations of the eclipitic, which are used even now in Europe. Vide Jastrow's 'Religion of Babylon and Assyria' p. 370 for identification of Marduk, Ishtar and other Babylonian gods with planets and p. 371 for the fact that Ishtar (Veous! figures most prominently among the preserved astrological texts and * Babylonian and Assyrian Religion' by S. H. Hooke pp. 24-30. 

Rgueda references to auspicious days 

523 

'O Agni! I establish thee on the best place of the earth (the uttaravedi), the place of worship and for libation, securing lucki ness of day; may you shine opulently on the (river) Drsadvati, on the concourse of people, on the river Apayā and on Sarasvati (Rg. III, 23.4).749, 

There are several other passages in which a wish is expressed that the days would be auspicious or lucky for sacrificers etc. Vide Rg. IV. 4. 7, V. 60.5, VII. 11, 2, VII, 18. 21, 1. 124.2 (May new dawns like the past ones shine for us with wealth and lucky days ), X. 39.12.749a 

It has already been seen above (note 726 ) that in Rgvedic times cows were driven (by way of dowry) to the bridegroom's house on Aghās (Maghās) and the bride was carried in a chariot to the bridegroom's house after the marriage on the Arjuni (or Phalguni) naksatra. In accordance with this the nakṣatras on which marriage should be celebrated are enumerated in the Baud. gr. as Rohini, Mrgaśīrsa, Uttarā-Phalguni and Svāti. 

It has already been shown above (on p. 506) how Agnyādheya (the setting up of the sacred fires) was to be performed on one of seren naksatras or in spring, summer and autumn according to the varṇā (class) of the performer (vide Kathaka S. 8.1, Sat. Br. II. 1.2, Tai. Br. I. 1.2.6-7). But an exception was recognized in the case of one performing a Soma sacrifice. It was provided that whenever a man had a desire to perform a Soma sacrifice he might establish the sacred fires in any season and that would bring prosperity to him.750. 

In ancient Vedic passages no clear line of demarcation appears between what may be called natural astrology and

Hesiodic system (which is at least several centuries later than the Rgveda) furnishes the earliest evidence for lucky and unlucky days, though Hesiod admits that there was divergence of opinion on that point.

individual astrology. For example, in the Tai. Br.751 it is provided that people plough their fields on Anurādhā naksatra, of which Mitra is the presiding deity. The Pāraksaragshya prescribes in the same strain that a man should put the ploughshare (in his field) on an auspicious day or on Jyesthā nakṣatra of which Indra is the presiding deity (and rains are in the hands of Indra). On the other hand, the same Brāhmaṇa 752 (Taittiriya) provides that if a man desires that his daughter should be dear to her husband be should get her married when the moon is in Nistyā (Svāti) naksatra and that if he does so his daughter becomes dear to her husband and never comes back to her father's house. The naksatras from Krttikā to Viśākhā have been declared to be Devanaksatras and whatever rites are performed on them are declared to have been performed on a holy day (punyāna). Even as early as the Atharvaveda 753 it appears to have been believed that a boy born on Jyesthā or on Vicrt (i. e. Mūla naksatra) or on a day called tiger-like (on an evil or terrible naksatra) might himself die or bring about the death of his father or mother. The two verses may be translated as follows: '(the boy) is born on Jyesthaghni (i. e. Jyesthā) or on Vicrt which belongs to Yama; guard him against being uprooted; may (Agni) take him beyond all evil results in order that he may reach the long life of a hundred autumns. This valiant son was born on a tiger-like day and naksatra; may be not, while he grows, kill his father or his mother that gave him birth.'

Nakṣatras auspicious or evil

some others (like Jyesthā, Māla) were held to be pāpa (evil) naksatras. 

From a passage in the 754 Bṛ, Up. it appears that certain naksatras were called male "if a man desires May I reach greatness' he should observe milk diet for twelve days beginning in the northward passage of the Sun, in the bright half of a month and on a favourable day he offers into the fire on a male naksatra &c." 

From the above examples it will be apparent that prognos tications were based in very early Vedic times on the naksatras either of birth or on naksatras deemed auspicious or inauspicious. Puṣya appears to have been regarded as a very auspicious naksatra long before Pāṇini, who mentions another name of it as 'Sidhya'. But in these early times it does not appear that any rules had been arrived at about the influence of planets (except perhaps of Jupiter in Pusya) in certain naksatras or about horoscopes with planets in nakṣatras or rāśis (signs of the zodiac) or in certain 'houses'. In those days prognostica tions were confined mainly to naksatras, days and natural phenomena and bodily marks. For example, Pāṇini I. 4. 39 (Tutelupa lam:') provides a rule for a diviner considering the good or bad luck of a person. The FIFT explains 'laay: 999: विप्रश्नः। स कस्य भवति यस्य शुभाशुभं पृच्छयत। देवदत्ताय राध्यति ईक्षते वा नैमित्तिकः ZE: 7 CHIFT a quiciazai'. In qirola IV. 3, 73 'Spuigailet:' it is provided that the affix 370 (and not 34) is applied in the sense of 'तत्र भवः' or 'तस्य व्याख्यानः ' to the words in the ऋगयनगण, which contains among others the words अऋविद्या, उत्पात and निमित्त (i. e. alhlfa and stienila would mean 'one who expounds the future consequences indicated by 3917 i. e. earthquake &c. and afha throbbing &c.). Under qua III, 2.53 the fer gives the examples initia164:, giat quran (line on the palm ). 

We find from certain verses of the Rgveda that the cries of such birds as kapiñjala were deemed even in those ancient times

to indicate coming events, auspicious or otherwise; 755 '(the bird) crying again and again and voicing (indicating) coming event sends forth his speech as an oarsman propels a boat; O bird! may you be auspicious to us and may no unfavourable sign reach you from any quarter; O birdl may you that are auspicious and whose cry forebodes good cry to the south of (our) houses; may no thief master us nor may any one declare that we may meet danger.' Br. S, 98. 14 provides that birds indicate to a person going on a journey the evil results of actions, good or evil, done by him in former lives. The Yoga-yātrā of Varāhamihira (chap. 14) and Adbhutasāgara pp. 569-582 deal at length with sakuna (prognostications from the sight, flight or cries of birds and other animals). Yogayātrā (14.2 and 26 ) provides that certain birds and animals when they are to the right or southern side of a man starting on a journey indicate auspicious results and that when a cāsa bird with something in its mouth flies to the right side of a man that is an indication of welfare. 

The result of the dependence on ideas of lucky and unlucky days and naksatras was that some people began to make observations and deduce conclusions and a lore called 'naksatra -vidyā' arose. When Nārada approached the great teacher Sanatkumāra for knowledge, the latter questioned him as to what he already knew and then Nārada enumerated a long list of lores (including 756 the four Vedas, Itihāsa-purāṇa), one of which is 'naksatravidyā' ('the science of nakṣatras' i. 6. astronomy and astrology ). It can be easily imagined how credulous people in ancient times as even in these days con sulted those who professed to know what the stars foretold and were often deceived or felt frustrated. Hence arose even in early times a prejudice against star-gazers, astrologers and the

like. One of the earliest references to this projudice against star gazers in Sanskrit literature is found in the Tai. Bṛ. III, 4. 4 and Vāj. S. 30. 10 and 20, where the 757 'naksatradarśa' (star-gazer) is made over as a victim to prajñana and tha 'ganaka'( calculator of the movements of stars and planets) is consigned to aquatic animals along with the headman of the village. Among the long list of brāhmapas that should not be invited for religious rites in honour of gods or in śrūddhas, Manu (III, 162 ) includes one who maintains himself by the practice of astrology (naksatrair. yaśca jīvati) and in (VI. 50 ) Manu prohibits ascetics from desiring to secure alms by foretelling the results of portents (like earth-quakes) or of bodily 758 movements (such as the throbbing of the eye or arm ) or by nakṣatravidyā ( astrology ) or angaridyā (palmistry) or by casuistry or by telling what the śāstra ordains on a (disputed) point. The ancient sūtras of Hārīta and of Saṅkhalikhita declare that a nakṣat rajivin (one who lives by practising astrology) and a 'naksatrādesavrtti' (who makes his livelihood by conveying the message of nakṣa tras ) respectively are unfit to sit in a row with other brāhmaṇas (q. by Kr̥tyakalpataru on śrāddha p. 88). Similarly, Sumantu (in a prose passage q. on śrāddha by Kr̥tyakalpataru p. 91 ) states the same about a 'mūlyasāmvatsarika' (who practises astrology for money ). The Viṣṇudharma-sūtra (chap. 82.7) includes those who maintain themselves by astrology (naksatra jivinah ) among those who are not to be invited for srāddha rites. Similarly, the Tevijjasutta ( S. B. E. vol. XI. pp. 196–197) and Mahāśila in Digbanikāya (I. p. 68 ) condemn for Buddhist monks maintenance by such low arts as guessing at the length of a man's life or by foretelling future events (such as eclipses, falling meteors, victory and defeat &c.). But the mere study of constellations is allowed by Buddha (in S. B. E. vol. XX. pp. 292-294). Among obstacles to gain 759 Kautilya enumerates

many such matters as passion of love, anger, timidity and desire to find out an auspicious tithi and naksatra' and winds up with two fine verses characteristic of the great genius that placed Candragupta Maurya on the throne of Magadha: "The desired object ( or wealth) eludes that childish man that is excessively in search of what the stars portend: for the desired object is ( itself) the star that governs ( success ) in securing it; what will stars do? Men striving ( to attain their ends ) will secure their objects after hundreds of efforts; wealth is caught by wealth just as elephants are bound by other elephants (opposed to them ).' From the above it is quite clear that several centuries before Christ an astrologer ( who maintained himself on money acquired by the practice of astrology) was very much condemned. 

What Kautilya regards as reprehensible is extreme reliance on and pursuit of naksatra astrology, but it is not to be supposed that he ignored prognostications altogether. About the king's purohita (priest ) he lays down the following 760 *the king should appoint as priest a person whose family and character are highly spoken of, who has well studied the Veda together with the six angas, the divine and other portents and the science of the government of people and who can prevent divine and human calamities by means contained in the Atharvaveda, the king should follow him as a pupil does his teacher or a son his father or a servant his master. Yāj. (I. 313), who is later than Kautilya by some centuries, also lays down in almost identical words that the king should appoint as purohita one who is proficient in astrology, endowed with all requirements declared in śāstras, and is proficient in the science of govern ment and the propitiatory and magic rites of the Atharvaveda'. 

Another set of texts indicates another stage in the develop ment of astrology based on naksatras, which seems to have been 

somewhat on the lines of the later horoscopic system of ‘houses". Traces of it exist though they are not very ancient. The Vaikhānasasmārta 761 sūtra (IV. 14) refers to nakṣatras called Janma, Karma, Sānghātika, Sāmudayika and Vaināśika and these terms are explained in the Yogayātrā of Varāha and in the

Viṣṇudharmottara-purana.762 The Yogayatra remarks763 - the naksatra on which a man is born is called ādya (first), the tenth from it (from ādyu ) is called kirma, the 16th naksatra from the adya is called 'sānghātika' (pertaining to a group or a collection of human beings), the 18th (from adya) is called Samudaya (collection) and the 23rd (from ādya) is called Vaināśika (lit. pertaining to death or destruction), the 25th (from adya) is called mūnasa (pertaining to the mind); in this way all persons are concerned with six naksatras (1st, 10th, 16th, 18th, 23rd and 25th ); they say that the king is concerned with nine nakṣatras, the three additional ones being those connected with his jāti (caste), his country and with the naksatra on the day of his coronation. The Yogayātrā and Viṣṇudharmottara (I. 78. 14-16) further provide 'when the naksatra of one's birth is affected by evil (star or aspect) the results are the appearance of disease, loss of money, and disputes%3B if the nakṣatra called karma is affected then one's under takings do not succeed; if the Sānghātika (16th) is affected then there is treachery; when the Sāmudayika (18th) is affected there is loss of accumulated wealth; when the Vainasika (23rd) is affected, one's desired objects perish; when Manasa (25th) is affected, there is anxiety and unhappiness. The Nārada purāṇa,7634 after defining the above, remarks that one should not commence any auspicious act on these. When the (six ) naksatras are not affected (by evil stars or aspects) a person is healthy, enjoys happiness, his body is well-nourished and he is endowed with wealth; but if the six naksatras are affected he

perishes and the king also (meets the same fate) if the six along with the extra three are affected. When 764 the naksatra on which a king was crowned is affected by evil planets or aspects, one should predict loss of the kingdom, if the naksatra of the country is affected trouble to the country and capital is indicated and if the naksatra of the king's caste is affected then one should predict king's illness. The naksatras according to the caste of the king are as follows 765 : the three Pūrvas (Phalguni, Purvāsādha and Purvābhādrapadā) and Krttikā are pakṣatras of the king of the brāhmaṇa class; the three Uttarās (Uttarā Phalguni, Uttarāsādha and Uttarābhādrapada) and Puṣya are naksatras for a king of the ksatriya caste; Revati, Anuradhā, Magha and Rohini, of agricultural class; Punarvasu, Hasta, Abhijit and Aśvini are naksatras of the vanik (trader) class. The countries governed by the nakṣatras are set out in chap. 14 of the Brhat-samhitā. Herein Varāha differs from Ptolemy in two respects:(1) Varāba does not mention countries governed by rāśis, but countries governed by naksatras; (2) Varāha confines himself to India, while Ptolemy in his Tetrabiblos ( 11. 3 pp. 157-159, Loeb Classical Library) deals with all countries then known. This is an important circumstance against the theory that Varāba's astrology is borrowed from Ptolemy or later Greek writers. If he had known Ptolemy's work he could have easily followed bim even as to countries outside India. The whole of India is divided into nine parts, the Madhyadeśa and the regions in the eight quarters from the East to the North-east, each part being under groups of three naksatras from Krttikā on wards. Vide also Viṣṇudharmottara I. 86. 1-9. When the group of three naksatras in each of nine divisions is affected by the Sun, Mars or Saturn, the countries falling under any of the three naksatras of the group suffer calamities. The Mārkapdeya purana (chap. 58. 10-54 in B. I. edition, chap. 55 in Venkateśvara Press edition) also specifies the countries in the nine groups, but the names differ to some extent. There is some divergence

about the nomenclature also. According to Parāśara and the Viṣṇudharmottara (1. 87, 7) the 4th naksatra from the naksatra of birth is called Mānasa. A nakṣatra 766 is said to be affected (upahata ) when the Sun or Saturn occupies it or when Mars is retrograde in it or occults it or an eclipse ( of the Sun or Moon) occurs in it or a meteor strikes it or when the moon continuously affects it (by occulting or occupying its middle or goes to the southern part of it). The Viṣṇudharmottara (I. 89. 1-13), Yogayātrā IX. 13-18, and Parāśara (quoted by the Adbhuta sāgara pp. 271–274) prescribe certain śānti rites for averting the evil effects of the above noted nine nakṣatras being affected. 767 

It should be noted that in the astrology depending on twelve rāśis and twelve bhāras ( places or houses ) karma is the name given to the 10th house from the first (just as in the case of naksatra astrology ) and mrtyu ( i. e. vināśa) is the name of the 8th bhāra. 

The Mahābhārata and the Rāmāyaṇa contain numerous passages where the planets in relation to certain nakṣatras are stated to indicate misfortunes to people in general, to warring armies and to individuals. A few examples may be cited by way of illustration. When in the sanguinary battle between Rāvana and Rāma, the former seemed to be getting the better of Rāma, the Rāmāyaṇa states 768 Mercury stood covering the Rohini nakṣatra which is presided over by Prajāpati and which is the favourite of the moon and thereby indicated evil fortune to people'. Similarly, it is said 'Mars stood covering the nakṣatra Visakhā in the sky, which is presided over by Indra and Agni and which is the naksatra of the Kosalas'. In the Mahābhārata numerous statements are made about the position of the planets, the naksatras and tithis, which it is almost

767. In the Malavikāgoimitra of Kalidasa the Vidūsaka says to the king in the 4th Act 'astrologers declare that your nakṣatra is afflicted and (therefore) you should release all persoas confined in jails '.

impossible to reconcile. Vide H. of Dh. vol. III, pp. 903-923 for consideration of the astronomical data in the Mahābhārata. Here we are concerned only with the beliefs about certain omens and portents. In the Bhisma-parva we read 769 a white celestial body stands traversing Citrā nakṣatra; one sees therein specially the destruction of the Kurus; a very frightful comot stands covering Pusya-naksatra; this great graha will bring about terrible evil to both armies. A white blazing graha resembling fire emitting smoke stands covering the bright Jyesthā-naksatra whose presiding deity is Indra; a cruel comet standing between Citrā and Svāti afflicts Rohiṇi and the Sun and the Moon'. 

There are several statements about Mars that are more or less irreconcilable.770 For example, the Udyogaparva says 'Mars having been retrograde in Jyesthā seeks (to reach or afflict?) Anurādhā presided over by Mitra, as if bringing death'; while Bhiṣma-parva remarks ‘Mars is retrogade in Maghā and Jupiter is in Sravana and Saturn afflicts the naksatra presided over by Bhaga (i. e. Purvā Phalguni). About Saturn several 771 statements are made a refulgent and malignant planet, Saturn, afflicts the naksatra (ruled over by Prajāpati i. e. Rohiṇi) and will afflict people more'; 'Saturn stands afflicting Rohini'; Jupiter and Saturn are near Viśākhā'. 

One very remarkable feature of the Mahābhārata passages is that while they put forward dozens of times the positions of the Sun, the Moon and planets in reference to naksatras, not a single passage gives the position of the planets in relation to rāśis, the signs of the Zodiac, or week-days (such as Tuesday, Sunday &c.). 

The Atharvaṇa Jyotisa furnishes a somewhat different scheme of nakṣatra astrology. It says:772 the 10th naksatra from

the naksatra of a man's birth is called karma, the 19th (from janma-naksatra) is called garbhādhānaka (naksatra of concep tion), the 2nd, 11th and 20th constitute the group called sampatkara ( bringing about prosperity), the 3rd, 12th and 21st (from janmanaksatra) constitute the group of vipatkara (bringing about ill-luck or distress), the 4th, 13th and 22nd are called kṣemya (causing prosperity), the 5th, 14th and 23rd are called ' pratvara (pratyari?)', 6th, 15th and 24th constitute (the group called) sādhaka ( that accomplish), the 7th, 16th and 25th are called naidh ina (relating to death), the 8th, 17th and 26th are maitra (friendly ), the 9th, 18th and 27th constitute a highly friendly group. These are nine groups (each made up of three naksatras from among 27 naksatras and each one in each group being separated by the number 9 from the next in the same group). These names make a further approach to the scheme of twelve bhāvas 713 viz. janma (which corresponds in name and import to tanu or lagna), sampat (corresponds to the 2nd bhāva called dhana), karna(is same as 10th bhāva), naidhana (corresponds to 8th bhāva called vināśa or mṛtyu), maitra (corresponds to the 4th bhāva called suhrt), kṣemya (corresponds to the name of the 11th bhāva called aya or lābha). The Atharvana-Jyotisa then provides at some length what should be done or not done on these nine groups and their constituents. The above mentioned words (vipatkara, kṣemya &c.) occur also in Brhad-yogayātrā

It should be noted that the Atharvaṇa-Jyotisa gives at least five names that are the same as the corresponding bhāvas in extant Jataka works. It is difficult to state the date when the extant Atharvana Jyotisa might have been composed. It mentions week-days but does not enumerate the twelve zodiacal signs, it refers to the doctrine of Bhrgu (9.1.). Verses 1-4 of Ātharvana Jyotisa (chapter 13 ) are the same as Manu III. 46-49; similarly, Atharvana Jyotisa 12. 8-9 are almost the same as Manu IV. 41-42. It is quite possible that the present text is a recast of an older work. In any case the present text of the Atharvana Jyotisa cannot be placed earlier than the 2nd or 1st century B.C, and may be a little later still But it appears that the present Atharvaṇa Jyotisa only collects together the ideas then current and therefore the five names (janma, sampat, naidhana, mitra and karma) could very well have been current centuries before the present Atharvaṇa Jyotiṣa text. Similarly, it is difficult to assign an exact date to the Viṣṇu-dharmottara purapa. It is in the nature of an encyclopaedia of the then knowledge of several lores and its present text may be assigned to some period between the 4th and sixth century A. D. 

From the passage of the Brhadāraṇyka Upanisad (in note 754) it would be seen how auspicious times were prescribed for rites to be performed by an individual. The Brāhmaṇas and Kalpasūtras prescribed the auspicious naksatras and seasons for solemn Vedic sacrifices. The grhya and dharma sūtras pre scribed for domestic rites auspicious times, which were either the same or similar to those prescribed in the Brāhmaṇas, Br. Up. and the Kalpasūtras. A few examples may be cited here. The Āśvalāyana (I. 13.1), Āpastamba (VI. 14.9), Baudhāyana (I. 10. 1) and Pāraskara (I. 14) and other gļhyasūtras provide that the rite of Pursavana (that would produce male issue) was to be performed in the third month after conception on Tisya (Pusya) nakṣatra or on a day on which the moon would be in

a male naksatra.774 The Bhāradvājagļhya expressly mentions Tisya, Hasta, Anurādhā, Uttarā Bhādrapadā as the proper naksatras for pumsavana. As regards caula (tonsure ) Apastamba-grhya (VI. 16.3) prescribes that it should be per formed in the third year after birth on Punarvasu nakṣatra. The name of the nakṣatra may be noted, which literally means 'fresh wealth or new growth.' The Kausika-gūtra mentions' pāpanaksatra' (in 46.25) and pumnaksatra (lucky naksatra) in 35. 2. There are varying provisions about marriage. The Āp. gr. says that all seasons are proper for marriage, excepting the two months of Sisira (viz, Māgha and Phālguna) and excepting the last month (Āsādha) of summer, and all naksatras declared to be auspicious.775 The sutra also quotes an ancient gāthā stating that persons for choosing a girl should be sent out on Invakās (i e. Mrgaśīrsa) and then they are greeted with success. As regards marriage the Gobhila-gļhya provides a simple rule that it should be performed on an auspicious ( punya ) naksatra, while the Pāraskara 716 is more elaborate viz. one should take a maiden's hand in marriage in the northward passage of the sun, in the fortnight of the increasing moon, on an auspicious day and on Uttarā Phalguni, Hasta, Citrā, Uttarāsādhā, Sravana, Dhanisthā, Uttara-bhadrapadā, Revati, AŚvini, Svāti, Mrgasiras and Rohiṇi nakṣatras. The Baudhāyana-gļhya 777 declares: all months are proper for marriage; some (sages ) say that the months of Asadha, Māgha and Phālguna are to be avoided; the naksatras for marriage are Rohini, Mṭgaśirsa, UttarāPhalguni and Svāti; while for other auspicious rites the naksatras are

Punarvasu, Tisya, Hasta, Sroṇā (Sravana) and Revati. The Āśvalāyana-grhya generalises the auspicious times for several important saṁskāras as follows:778 'the rites for caula, u panayana, godāna and marriage are to be performed in the northward passage of the sun, in the fortnight of the waxing moon and on an auspicious naksatra; some (sages) hold that marriage may be performed at all times'. Āśv. further provides that the maiden after marriage was to observe silence and to begin speaking after seeing the Polestar, Arundhati and the constella tion of the Seven Sages. This generalisation is carried further by the Pūryamımāmsā-sūtra which provides 779 all ritas in honour of the gods are to be performed in the northward passage of the sun, on a day in the bright half of the month and on an auspicious day'. 

It will be seen clearly from the above discussion that an auspicious naksatra was the sine qua non in almost all Vedic rites and also in ordinary domestic rites in the times of the Brāhmaṇas and sūtras (several centuries before the Christian era), the tithi was rarely mentioned, the week-day was not mentioned nor the name of any rāśi ( zodiacal sign) nor is there any reference to the planets Jupiter and Venus in most sūtras even when prescribing proper times for upanayana or marriage. 

This requirement of finding out an auspicious day or nakṣatra for the celebration of a marriage or other domestic rite or for engaging in any undertaking was said in medieval Sanskrit works to be a search for an auspicious muhurta. It is therefore necessary to hold a discussion on the meaning and history of the word muhurta.
