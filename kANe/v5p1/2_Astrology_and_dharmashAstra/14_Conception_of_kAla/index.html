<p>KĀLA, MUHŪRTA, the influence of Astrology on DHARMASĀSTRA and CALENDAR</p>
<p>CHAPTER XIV</p>
<p>Conception of Kala</p>
<p>Among the first of the great problems of philosophy is that of the nature of Space ( dik) and Time ( kāla).</p>
<p>The questions that arise are: Are Space and Time ultimately real? Is the world we apprehend spaceless and timeless or has the universe a beginning in time; are Space and Time them. selves things or real, attributes or relations of things. Great divergence of views has prevailed on these problems from ancient times to this day. It is therefore advisable to indicate briefly the speculations on Time contained principally in Sanskrit works.</p>
<p>The word Kāla occurs only once in the Rgveda 651 as a gambler collects the ksta (highest stake ) at the (proper) time&rsquo; (Rg. X. 42. 9, Kṛtam yac svaghni vicinoti kāle&rsquo;). The Atharvaveda contains two hymns (XIX. 53. 1-10 and XIX. 54, 1-5) embodying a most sublime conception of Kāla. A few striking verges 452 are translated here: Kāla (Time) carries (as) a horse with seven reins, thousand-eyed, ageless, endowed with</p>

XIX. 54. 5, 44 is styled a kiin . IX, 114.2 and is in later mythology the husband of lara who is called mother, father and son in *. I. 89.10 ; so probably कश्यप here is the same as प्रजापति. In अथर्व. VIII. 5.14 कश्यप is said to have created the amulet jewel &lsquo;कश्यपस्त्वामसुजत कश्यपस्वा समेरयत्&rsquo;. Ryte probably means bere&rsquo; boundaries separating the worlds&rsquo;.</p>

<p>plentiful seed (power); the wise poets mount him (as one mounts a chariot); all worlds are his wheels (53.1); he ( Kāla) himself brought together the worlds and he himself went round (all) worlds together; being the father, he became the son of them (worlds ); there is indeed no other brilliance that is higher (or beyond) him (53.4); in Time is mind, in Time is breath; in Time is placed name; all these beings are glad by time when it arrives (53.7); Time created beings; in the beginning Kāla (created) Prajāpati; the self-existent Kaśyapa sprang from Kāla and (so did) tapus spring from Kāla (53. 10); Kāla, the son, created past and the future, from Time arose the rk (verses) and the yojus ( sacrificial formulas) were born from time (54, 3); this world and the highest world, holy worlds and holy vidhrtis having completely conquered these worlds by the brahinan Time goes on (abides) as the highest god&rsquo; (54. 5).</p>
<p>From these passages it appears that the word Kāla was used even in very early Vedic times in two senses, viz. time in general ( as in modern Sanskrit and modern Indian languages ) and Time as identical with the Supreme Being or the source of Creation. This latter sense, it will be shown a little later on, is also emphasized in many Sanskrit works (including the Purāṇas ).</p>
<p>In the Satapatha-brāhmaṇa the word Kāla is often used in the sense of time&rsquo; or &lsquo;proper time &lsquo;653 8. g. ‘he (Rudra angry because he was excluded from a share in offerings ) flew up towards the north at the time when sliṣtakirt offering was to be made&rsquo; (1. 7. 3. 3 ); Prajāpati ( when cattle approached him) said</p>
<p>whenever you may get anything at the proper) time or at an improper time you may eat it&rsquo;( II. 4. 2. 4).</p>
<p>A few passages from some of the Upanisads regarded as ancient by most scholars may be cited here; the Chān. Up. II. 634 31. 1 (while speaking of Vāmadevya Sāman and its parts ) uses the word Kāla as equal to &rsquo;end&rsquo; or &lsquo;finish&rsquo;. The Br. 655 Up. I. 2.4</p>

<p>says &ldquo;He desired &lsquo;would that a second self of me were produced&rsquo; &hellip; He bore him for a time as long as a year; after that long time he brought him forth&rdquo;. In the dialogue between Gārgya and king Ajātasatru in the same Upanisad Gārgya put forward several objects which he reverenced (upāsana) as brahma when the king replied as to those cases in these words. Prūna ( breath ) does not leave him before the time&rsquo; and &lsquo;death does not come to him before time?. Here the word &lsquo;Kāla&rsquo; is used in the sense of</p>
<p>proper or appointed time&rsquo;. In the passage of the Kausitaki Br. that corresponds to Br. Up. II. 1.10 and 12 the words are &rsquo;neither he himself nor his progeny pass into unconsciousness before the time&rsquo; and &rsquo;neither he nor his progeny dies before the time&rsquo;. In some passages of the Svetāśvatara Up. some thinkers are stated to have put forward Kāla as the cause or source of creation e. g. &ldquo;what is the cause ? 656 Is it Brahma? Whence are we born? Whereby do we live? On what are we established (or where are we going?)&hellip; Time or inherent nature or necessity or chance or elements or yoni (praksti) or the person, it is to be considered ( whether one of these is cause )&rsquo;; &lsquo;Some sages dis course upon inherent nature ( as the cause ) while other deluded persons speak of Time ( as the cause ).&rsquo; Here Kāla is represented as the cause of creation, which is the 2nd meaning of the word Kāla set out from the Atharvaveda. In another passage 657 of the same Up. Kāla is said to have been generated by Him who is intelligent and omniscient. The first meaning of Kāla ( time in general) is also found in Svetāśvatara Up. &lsquo;He (God) is the beginning, the efficient cause of (all) combinations, He is beyond the three times and is also without parts&rsquo;.

<p>said elsewhere &lsquo;Food is indeed the source of this whole world, and time of food; the Sun is the source of time&rsquo;. Then a little later on it proceeds &ldquo;Thus one has said &lsquo;From Time flow beings, from Time they reach growth, and in Time they come to dis appear; Time is a form (i. e. has definite shape or limits ) and is (also ) formless&rdquo;. Then it propounds &ldquo;There are indeed two forms of brahma, Time and Timeless. That which is prior to the Sun is Timeless ( form of Brahma) and it is without parts, But that which begins with the Sun is Time that has parts; year is the form of the Time that has parts. All these beings are produced from the year, through the year these beings when born grow, and they disappear in the year. Therefore the year is Prajāpati, is time, is food, is Brahma nest (or abode ) and is Ātman. And it has been said &ldquo;Time cooks ( ripens or digests ) all beings in the Great Self; that man knows the ( real import of) Veda who knows that in which Time is cooked&rdquo;. Here the Maitri Up. speaks of Time in its two senses, contains the germ of the later conception of the experience of Time as due to the actions or movements of the Sun, and refers to Time in the same terms in which the Tai. Up. (III. 1) speaks of brahma. It is unnecessary to set out passages from other Upanisads such as the Mahānārāyaṇa (XI, 14 aham-eva kālo nāham kālasya ) where Kāla is identified with God ( Nārāyana ).659</p>
<p>The Mahābhārata recurs to the theme of Kāla time and again. In the Adiparva it is said &ldquo;Kāla creates beings and Kāla destroys people; Kāla extinguishes Kāla that is engaged in destroying people; Kāla brings about good or evil states (or things); Kāla reduces all people and again sends them forth; Kāla is (the only one) awake when all are asleep (i. o. dead or</p>

<p>liberated); for Kala is invincible&rsquo;. The Strīparva has the following ‘Kāla cooks all beings and Kāla destroys people; Kāla is invincible&rsquo;. The Sāntiparva 660 in chapters 221 and 227 contains a long disquisition on the formidable influence of Kāla on all including gods like Indra. In the śāntiparva it is asserted &lsquo;beyond the mind is the Great Intelligence and beyond the latter, is the Great Time; beyond Time is the adorable Viṣṇu to whom belongs the whole world&rsquo;. In another place the Santiparva, after detailing nineteen gunas the last being dvandva yoga (pairs of opposites such as pleasure and pain), remarks that the 20th guna beyond the nineteenth is Kāla and that one should know these twenty to be the source and end of all beings, The Āśvamedhika-parva describes (chap. 45) the wheel of Time in an elaborate metaphorical way (verses 1-9) and remarks that the man who well knows the action of Kāla and its sublation is never deluded and reaches the highest goal. In Vanaparva Krsna is identified with Brahma, Rudra, the Sun, the Moon, Dharma, Yama, Kāla &amp;c. Vide for further references Sāntiparya 25. 5 ff, 224-225.</p>
<p>In the Bhagavadgītā the word kāla is used in the sense of time in general or proper time&rsquo; in several passages (such as IV.2, VIII. 7 and 27, VIII. 23, XVII. 20 ) and Kāla is identified with Krsna as Supreme Lord in one of his super-eminent manifestations in X. 30 and 33 (I am Kāla among those that seize and I am Kāla that is imperishable) and XI. 32 (I am Kāla, that has increased (in atrength) and that brings about the destruction of the worlds ).</p>
<p>Pāṇini employs the word kāla in his sūtras many times, but in the sense of time in general or the divisions of time or proper time. Patañjali on Pāṇini III. 3. 167 ( Kālasamayavelāsu tumun) quotes a half verse about Kāla, which is the same as the one quoted above from the Mahābhārata (in note 659 ) and which appears to have been cited by Patañjali as a well-known verse. In another place Patañjali while explaining Vārtika % on Pāpini (II, 2.5) states a very important theory about Kāla.</p>

<p>History of Dharmaśāstra (Sec. II, Ch. XIV He says 661 &ldquo;People speak of that as Kāla whereby the increases (or growths) and decreases in solid bodies are observed and the same (time) is called day and night when conjoined with some activity. What is that activity? (the reply is): the motion of the Sun. When that (motion of the Sun) is repeated again and again there is a month and a year&rsquo;. This means that Kāla does not exist except as a convenient name or word for the manner of measuring change or becoming in what we observe by comparing one series of changes with another.</p>
<p>In the Manusmr̥ti the Supreme 662 Lord is said to have created time and its divisions (I. 24 Kalam kalavibhaktisca) and to have, after He produced the universe, disappeared in himself again and again, squeezing one period of time by means of another period (I. 51).</p>
<p>Coming to the philosophical systems, it may be noted that the Sāṅkhya system does not include Kāla as a separate tattva in its twenty-five tattvas. But Kala was not altogether forgotten in that system. The Saṅkhyakārika 663 states that the karanus are thirteen, three being abhyantura (internal i. e. inside the body ) and ten being banya; the latter are concerned with the present, while the former are concerned with the three times (past, present and future).</p>

<p>existence of Kāla are the apprehensions of a thing as posterior or prior, the apprehension of simultaneity of certain things, the apprehension of a thing as lasting long or as being momentary, that it is nitya, one and the (efficient) cause of all things that are created. Prasastapāda gives the instance of an old man and a young man being seen by a person in one place and direction or in different directions, who apprehends after looking at a young man that another man called old differs from a young man as regards a grown-up moustache or beard, wrinkles on the body and baldness and so apprehends that the old man is remote from the young man and therefore apprehends him as beyond (para) while he thinks of the young man as near, posterior and so apura.</p>
<p>There were certain philosophers who held that Time is either past or future and denied that there is present time (vartamāna). The Nyāyasūtra refutes this view and holds that time is either past, present or future (II. 1. 39-43). From Patañjali&rsquo;s 665 Mahābhāṣya it appears that even in his day there were philosophers that held that there was no time called present and that those people quoted certain verses in support.</p>
<p>The Nyāyamañjart 666 of Jayantabhatta (K. S. S. 1936 ) has a long discussion on Kāla. It first sets out the views of those who deny the very existence of Kāla as a separate entity. These latter say that Kāla is not perceptible like a jar &amp;c. and that</p>

<p>the ideas of quickness or slowness depend merely on the observed effects. The same theorists raise the further objection that if Kāla is a dravya (substance) that is all-pervading and per manent, as the Vai eṣikas assert, then how is it that Kāla is spoken of as past, present and future. To these objections some reply: Kāla is directly perceived, since it appears to the mind as distinguishing the various perceptions of effects, that the soveral experiences such as these matters happened simultan eously, this happened after long, this happened quickly&rsquo; cannot be perfectly explained if one denies the existence of Kāla and holds that these experiences depend solely on the perceived objects or actions. Others hold that Kāla is really inferred and not directly perceived. They argue: merely because Kāla is not directly perceived it does not follow that it does not exist; to infer that Kāla exists is proper as it is proper to infer that the other side of the moon exists though we see only that face of the moon that is below the earth; therefore Kāla exists as a separate entity to which is due the common experience of simul taneity, quickness or slowness &amp;c. The differing observations about persons being young or old cannot be well explained with out admitting the existence of Kāla, which like ākāśa is one, all-pervading and permanent. To the objection how, if Kāla is one, all pervading and nitya, it is spoken of as having three divisions, the reply is: in reality there are no divisions in Kāla, but divisions are imagined in Kāla on account of the upādhi (a limiting or restrictive adjunct ) viz. kriyā (activity ). When we speak of a man as cooking rice in the present (odanam pacati ), that is due to the distinguishing nature of the result (boiled rice) which is brought about by several activities ( kriyās ) beginning with the placing of the cooking pot on the fire up to its being taken down on the ground. Then we use the word present&rsquo;. But when we bear in mind the series of activi ties that produced the boiled rice we use the expression &ldquo;he cooked&rsquo; ( in the past tense ) for the activities that have ended. In this way we speak of time also as past on account of the dis tinguishing characteristic of the activities that have ended.</p>

<p>Kāla in Yogasūtrabhāeya</p>
<p>471</p>
<p>In the Yogagūtrabhāsya on III. 51 there is a brief but very interesting and abstruse disquisition on Kāla. The sūtra runs 667a</p>
<p>• by constraint (sainyama) upon moments (ksana) and their sequence ( or succession) (arises) knowledge due to discrimina tion&rsquo;. The bhāsya explains : just as an atom is substance or matter ( draiya ) reaching the limit of minuteness, so a kṣaṇa (moment) is time that reaches the highest limit of minuteness, or a ksana (moment) is time taken by an atom in leaving the posi tion in space it occupies or the time taken in reaching the next point in space; krama ( sequence) is the non-cessation of the flow of moments; moments and their succession do not form a collection ( or combination) of actual (or perceptible) things. Muhurta ( 30th part of day and night ), day and night and others are combinations made by the mind (or by mental con ceptions). This time, though devoid of being a real thing by itself, is indeed only a creation of mental conceptions and results from knowledge derived from words ( alone ) and appears as if it were an actual object to ordinary people whose doct rines are divergent (or confused ). But ksana (moment) falling among (i. e. being mixed up with ) real perceptible things appears ( to the human mind) as dependent on or constituting sequence (or succession ). Krama (sequence) is of the nature of uninterrupted succession. This sequence is called Kāla by</p>
<p>Yogins who know (the real nature of ) time. For, two ksanas cannot exist together (simultaneouly ). It is inipossible that there should be a sequence of two moments that exist simultane ously. When a later moment comes after an earlier one without interruption, that is called krama. In the present there is only one moment and there are no earlier and later moments in the present. Therefore there can be no combination of two moments (in reality ). But those moments that have passed away and those that are yet to come are to be interpreted or described as</p>

<p>connected with the ( constant) flux of changes (in the world). Therefore the whole world experiences change in each single moment. So all these ( external) aspects of the world are de pendent on one moment ( in the present).</p>
<p>This disquisition shows that the Yogasutra and its bhāsya held that time was not a dranya and not a tangible reality, but that it was merely a word, a mental concept inseparable from the perception or experience of physical objects as a characteri stic (viśesana or upādhi), that it attaches itself to the changing realities, that we measure it according to the movements of or changes in things and that it was not merely like a hare&rsquo;s horn.</p>
<p>I have confined myself to Sanskrit works and particularly to works of the Vedic school type. €63 Buddhist and Jaina thinkers had to say a good deal on Kāla. For example, the Pramāna669-vārtika-bhāsya or Vārtikālankāra of Prajñākara gupta (about 700 A. D.) combats the view of the Vaiśesikasūtra and Prasastapāda ( quoted above) and holds that there is no separate entity like Kāla, that it is not possible to have the ideas of distant time and near time if Kāla be without beginning and be endless, that the ideas of being distant or near or quick are not distinct from the activities about which they are predicated. This Buddhist view practically amounts to saying that time is not a thing, but only an idea, only a subjective condition of human sensorial experiences and intuitions and is non-existent in itself, apart from the subject. On the other hand Jaina 670 writers hold that there are six parlārthas viz. jiva, dharma, adharma, ākāśa, pudyala and kāla i, o, Time has separate existence.</p>

<p>Kāla in the Purāṇas</p>
<p>473</p>
<p>Some of the Purāṇas contain disquisitions on Kāla. The nature of Time is described in the Kūrmapurāṇa as follows: This adorable 671 Kāla is without beginning and without end, it is ageless and immortal; it is a great Lord because it is all-em bracing, it is independent and is the self of all; there may be many Brahmās, Rudras and Nārāyaṇas and other gods. It is declared that the divine Lord is one and is omniscient and is Kala; they ( the gods) are created by Kala, which again swa llows (or makes them disappear); the gods Brahma, Narayana and Isa (Śiva ) are said to undergo prākrta disappearance by the power of Kāla and also spring again therefrom as highest Brahma, the elements, Vasudeva and Śhaṅkara. Therefore the whole world has its soul in Kāla. He alone is the highest Lord.&rsquo; The Viṣṇudharmottara 672 has a similar long disquisition on Kāla the gist of a few verses of which may be set out here &lsquo;Kāla is without beginning and without end, it is Rudra that seizos all (or it is Saṅkarsana); it is called Kala because it carries off or drives all beings. Kāla is great and the highest Lord, because it is beginningless and endless; it is more subtile than the wink ing of one&rsquo;s eye, very much more subtile than the subtilest. Its *subtileness cannot be understood even by Yogins. When a thousand lotus leaves are pierced by a needle ignorant people think that the piercing of all leaves is at the same time, but really the leaves are pierced at separate units of time. This is the subtileness of Kāla. But though Kāla is very very subtile, it is also great and measurement of it can be computed because of the motions of planets.&rsquo; The Vāyu and Kūrma both say &lsquo;Time creates beings and again destroys them; all are under the rule of Time, while Time is not under the dominance of</p>

<p>any one.&rsquo; The Viṣṇupurana 673 holds that Brahma which is one. unborn, permanent, ageless appears in the form of Kāla, which is without beginning or end. The Bhāgavatapurāṇa 674 also regards Kāla as inferred in regard to its minuteness and its grossness is all-pervading, and holds that it is supposed to have units from the subtlest (atom) to the highest&hellip;</p>
<p>Among astronomical works the Sūryasiddhānta states 675 &lsquo;Kala is the destroyer of worlds; another (kind of time) is of the nature of calculation; Kāla is of two kinds, gross and subtile, which are also called murta (physically apprehensible ) and amarta ( not so apprehended); (the divisions of ) time called prāpa ( respiration) and the like are mūrta, while truti and the like are amūrta.&rsquo; The Caraka-samhitā676 includes Kāla among nine dravyas and holds that it is acetana (non-sentient). Thus it agrees with the Vaiśeṣika viow. In the Suśrutasambitā it is declared &lsquo;Kala is indeed self-existent, without beginning, middle or end; the poverty or richness of substances that have ( one or</p>
<p>more of the six ) flavours (rasas) and the life and death of human beings are dependent on Kāla. It is called Kāla because it does not remain sticking to even the smallest division or because it heaps together (beings by leading beings to death ) or drives them together. Of that adorable Kāla which assumes the character of year, the divine Sun produces by his special move ments the divisions called twinkling of the eye, kāsthā &amp;c.</p>

<p>Kāla in grammatical works</p>
<p>475</p>
<p>Similarly, philosophical grammarians like Bhartrhari 677 ( author of the Vākyapadiya) holds that Kāla is a substance (dravya), all-pervading and permanent apart from activities, that it is the efficient cause of all created things, that it is divided into years, seasons &amp;c. on account of the different activities, just as the same man may be called a carpenter or a blacksmith &amp;c. (on account of his different activities ). For reasons of space it is not advisable to pursue the subject of the nature of time from other Sanskrit works of medieval and modern times. For those who desire to make a further study of this subject I would recommend the &lsquo;Kālasiddhānta-darsini&rsquo; composed and published by Shri Haranchandra Bhattācārya of Calcutta in 1941, which exhaustively deals with the philosophical conceptions about Kāla held by different sects, schools and Sanskrit writers.</p>
<p>There is a great temptation to compare Indian ancient and medieval conceptions about Time arrived at more than a thousand years ago with similar or corresponding conceptions on the same subject in modern Western philosophical works such as Kant&rsquo;s &lsquo;Critique of pure reason&rsquo;, Prof. S. Alexander&rsquo;s &lsquo;Space, Time and Deity &lsquo;(1927, London, two volumes ), &lsquo;Time and Western Man&rsquo; by Wyndham Lewis (London, 1927), Pierre Burgelin&rsquo;s &lsquo;L&rsquo; Homme et Le Temps&rsquo; (1945), Bergson&rsquo;s Time and Freewill&rsquo;, S. G. F. Brandon&rsquo;s &lsquo;Time and Mankind&rsquo; (1953). But as this volume has already grown to large proportions, comparisons with Western philosophical views have to be given up.</p>
<p>From very ancient times minute divisions of time have been mentioned. The Vāj. S. states 678 &rsquo;that all winkings of the eye (and similar units of time) were produced from the (supreme). Person that is brilliant (like lightning). This half verse occurs in the Mahānārāyaṇa Upanisad also. It is stated in the Bṛ. Up.679 that under the dominion of this imperishable brahma the Sun and the Moon are held apart, as also nimeṣas, muhurtas, days, and nights, half months, months, seasons, and years stand apart</p>

<p>The Mahānārāyana Upanisad&rsquo; (I. 8-9) mentions as units of time ‘Nimesas, Kalā, muhūrta, kāṣthā, ahorātra, half months,</p>
<p>months, rtus, year. Manu I. 64 provides that 18 nimesas are equal to kāṣthā, 30 kāṣthās to kalā, 30 kalās to muhūrta, 30 muhūrtas are equal to one day and night. Early and very exhaustive enumeration of the several units of time from subtlest to the highest are contained in Brhat-samhitā of Varāba and in the bhāsya of Prasastapāda on Vaiśesikasūtra 680 viz. “Kāla is the cause of the popular usage about the units being kṣaṇı, lavi, nimeṣas, kāṣthā, kalū, muhūrta, yāma ( prahara or Ath of a day), ahoratra (day and night), ardhamāsa (half month), māsa ( month), rtu ( season), ayana, samvatsara (year), yuga, manyantara, kalpa, pralaya and mahapralaya. The Puranas also dilate upon the units of time from nimeṣa to pralaya or kalpa. Vide Brahma 231, 6-12, Kūrma I. 5. 6-14, Padma V.3.4-20, Vāyu 57.6-35. Nimesa (lit. winking of the eye) is defined by the Vayu and Viṣṇudharmottara as the time required for pronouncing a short letter and the latter adds that a smaller unit than it cannot be (physically ) apprehended. There is great divergence of views about the number and names of the minute units of time and their mutual relations. A few examples alone can be cited. Manu (I.64) furnishes the following table : 18 nimesas=kāstha, 30 kāsthas = kala, 30 kalas = muhurta, 30 muhurtas ahoratra ( day and night). The Arthasastra. 681 of Kautilya provides : 2 trutas (i?)= lava, 2 lavas = nimesa, five nimesas == kastha, 30 kāsthās = kalā, 40 kalās = nādikā, % nādikās = muhūrta, 30</p>
<p>muhurtas = ahoratra. Some of the puranas contain the same 682 verge on the names and relations of small units of time viz.</p>

<p>15 nimesas = kāsthā, 30 kāsthās = kalā, 40 kalās = nādikā, 2 nādikās = muhūrta, 30 muhūrtas = day and night together. It should be noticed that here the relation of nimesas to kāṣtha is different from that in Manu and Kautilya The Arthaśāstra 683 of Kautilya does not stand alone in speaking of truta ( ? i) as the smallest unit of time. The Sūryasinddhānta ( quoted above) provides that truṭi is the smallest unit of time, that it is amurta (not apprehended physically ), that the prāna is the first mūrta (physically apprehended) unit of time, that 6 prānas are equal to a vinādi, that 60 vinādis are equal to a nādikā, 60 nādis are equal to an ahorātra. Utpala 631 on Br. S. quotes verses from Paulisa-siddhānta and Brāhmasphuṭa-siddhānta to the effect that six prāṇas are equal to a vinādikā, 60 vinād ikās are equal to a nādikā or ghaṭikā and 60 ghaṭikās are equal to a day (i. e. ahoratra ). A smr̥ti quoted in the Tithitattva states that two trutis make a lava, 2 lavas make a nimesa, so that truti is equal to įth of nimeṣa. Hemādri on Kāla (p.7) quotes a verse that truṭi is equal to two nimesas and 10 trutis are equal to prāṇa. The Amarakośa follows Manu as to eighteen nimesas being equal to kāṣthā, but it introduces a unit called kṣaṇa between kalā and muhūrta, so that its scheme is : 18 nimesas - kāṣthā, 30 kāṣthās = kalā, 30 kalās = ksana, 12 ksanas = muhūrta, 30 muhūrtas = ahorātra. The Bhāgavata-purāṇa (III. 11. 3-10) puts forward a far more elaborate scheme : two atoms (of Time ) = aṇu, 3 anus = trasarenu, 3 trasareṇus = truṭi, 100 trutis = vedha, 3 vedhas = lava, 3 lavas = nimeṣa, 3 nimesas = kṣaṇa, 5 ksaṇas = kāsthā, 15 kāṣthās = laghu, 15 laghus = nādikā, 2 nāļikās = muhūrta, 30 muhūrtas = ahoratra. In the Atharvaṇa-jyotisa the table is: 12 nimeṣas=lava, 30 lavas=kalā, 30 kalās = truti, 30 trutis = muhūrta. This agrees with none. Further units of time from ahorātra to pralaya will be dwelt upon a little later.</p>
<p>Before proceeding further clarification is required on certain points. At least several centuries before Christ Jyotisa had attained the position of being one of the six angas ( auxiliary</p>

<p>studies ) of the Veda. The Mundakopaniṣad 685 states that the aparā vidyā ( inferior exoteric knowledge ) comprises Rgveda, Yajurveda, Sāmaveda, Atharvaveda, Śikṣā ( Phoneties), Kalpa (ritual texts ), Vyakaraṇa (grammar), Nirukta (Etymology ), Chandas ( metrics ) and Jyotiṣa ( astronomy and mathematics ). The Āpastamba-dharmasūtra enumerates the same six angas of the Veda. In the Pāṇiniya Siksā 686 the science of the move ments of heavenly bodies is said to be the eye of the Veda. The Jyotisa which is Vedānga (of the Rgveda and Yajurveda ) was concerned with purely astronomical matters. In the Vedānga Jyotisa 687 it is remarked : &rsquo;the Vedas arose for the purpose of (use in ) sacrifices; sacrifices are enjoined according to the order of times; therefore he who knows Jyotiṣa which is the science laying down the (proper ) times knows sacrifices. Just as a tuft of hair stands on the head of peacocks or a jewel (in the heads ) of cobras, so ganita ( astronomical calculations) stand at the head of all the sciences that are (spoken of as) Vedāngas&rsquo;. This shows that the words Jyotisa and ganita are used as synonyms in the Vedānga-jyotisa. The Vṛddha-vāsiṣthasiddhānta ( Benares S. Series ) says &rsquo;this śāstra is indeed the eye of the Veda; therefore, among the angas (limbs, subsidiary lores of Veda) it has got pre ominence; a man endowed with all other limbs and therefore appearing to be perfect is worth nothing, if he is devoid of eyes.&rsquo; Gradually, however, Jyotisa came to include three distinct bran ches (skandhas) viz. the determination of the motions of planets by means of calculations which was called Tantra, the second called horā that deals with horoscopes and (was also called jātaka) and the third called Sakhā which was an extensive branch and included many topics of divination which are summarised</p>

<p>Branches of Jyotiṣa</p>
<p>479</p>
<p>in Br. S. chap. II. A work embodying complete presentation of the three branches was called sarnhitā 688 and he who well knew the three branches, viz. Ganita, Hora and Sakha. was called, as Garga says, &lsquo;Samhitāpāraga&rsquo; (master of samhita ). Varāhamihira689 himself tells us in the Brhaj-jataka, that, for the benefit of astrologers, he compiled a comprehensive work on Jyotisa in its three branches. The word Samhitā appears to have been used in two senses, the first690 (a wider sense) referring to a complete presentation of Gapita, Horā and Sākhā, while the second (a narrower sense) refers only to the Sakha. part. Why the third branch was called śākhā is not satisfactorily explain ed anywhere. It was so called probably because it had to deal with numerous circumstances, such as the fruits of the simple and retrograde movements of planets; the movements of Agastya ( Canopus) and saptarsis (Ursa Major), the conjunc tions and oppositions of planets, haloes, meteors. earthquakes, lore about the movements and cries of birds, nirājana, removal of the evil effects of utpūtas. In this sense samhitā was what is called natural astrology. Horā again had three sub-sections, viz. jātaka or janma ( judicial astrology, predictions from the situa tions of the zodiacal signs and planets at a person&rsquo;s birth ), Yātrā or Yātrika ( Brhaj-jātaka 28.4-5) that dealt with progno stications on starting on a journey or on a king&rsquo;s marching</p>

<p>The usual practice of the Grhyasūtras and Dharmaśāstra works was to take their astronomical requirements and know ledge from astronomers. The Gobhila-grhyasūtra691 provides: &rsquo;the work on this point is separate; one should study it or should obtain information about ( the exact time of) the parvan (New moon and Full moon) from those who know it.&rsquo; The astronomical knowledge of ancient and medieval India has been a subject riddled with acute controversies. Somewhat reluctantly I have come to the conclusion that discussions about the theories and practice of astronomy in ancient and medieval India should be omitted from the History of Dharmaśāstra. An adequate treat ment of ancient and medieval Indian astronomy and dis cussion of the theories advanced by Western scholars (some of them quite unwarranted) would require a large volume by itself. Here and there I may have to refer to pure astronomical matters for certain purposes. But the two other branches of Jyotisa, viz. Horā (astrology ) and Sākhā have exerted a vast influence on Dharmaśāstra and will have to be discussed within limits. Though Dharmaśāstra writers took their astronomy from astro nomers, they did not hold that astronomers had the last word, but they rather hold that if there was some conflict or contra diction between strict astronomical theory and Dharmaśāstra, the latter was to prevail. An example may be cited for illu strating this: Suppose that a man has resolved to undertake</p>

<p>About Astronomy and Astrology as developed in India Western scholars such as Weber, Whitney, Thibaut have pro pounded many sweeping and unwarranted theories based on flimsy data. Here and there I may have to refer to them. But I must say in one place how and why their conclusions are often unacceptable. In the first place, they do not attach due importance to the fact that a vast literature in Sanskrit has perished beyond recovery (as it is admitted was the case in Greece after Ptolemy composed his Almagest ) 693 and what we now have is a mere fraction of what once existed. In the second place, they forget or ignore that much of the literature that survives is religious and not intended to be a historical and full treatment of any topic i. e. most of the references to astronomical matters found in the Vedas and Brāhmaṇas are not made of set purpose but are incidental or casual. They hardly seem to be aware of the rule of caution and common sense that in ancient literature what is expressly stated may be used for drawing inferences, but the non-mention of certain matters cannot necessarily be a valid reason for arriv ing at the conclusion of non-existence, unless the subject matter was such that if something connected with it existed it should ordinarily have been mentioned. Further, and most important of all, mere similarities in institutions, usages and other matters should not be regarded as evidence of borrowing by one people from another people. Human mind is the same everywhere, its environment and the needs of human beings are often the same and no people, ancient or modern, can be regarded as having had the monopoly of great intellectual powers. Most of those who wrote on Indian literature and subjects in the 19th century were nurtured on the literature of the Greeks and Romans and on the vaunted superiority of the ancient Greeks in Philosophy, Mathematics, arts and other matters and of Egypt. But as ancient cuneiform tablets in Babylonia and the Middle East countries came to be deciphered, things began to be seen in</p>

<p>proper perspective. Modern scholars have, it is refreshing to note, outgrown the stage when all arts were traced to Greek (see &ldquo;Sumerians&rsquo; by Sir Leonard Woolley, 1928 p. 193, Glanville in *Legacy of Egypt&rsquo; p. 160 for the debt the Greeks owed to Egypt). Sir Thomas Heath was obliged to admit that the debt of the Greeks to the Babylonians was much greater than had been imagined.694 Sarton in a History of Science&rsquo; (London, 1953) has to say that it is childish to assume that science began in Greek (Preface p. IX). It has been found that the Greeks were inferior to the Babylonians in several respects, that their vaunted geometric lore was not as great intellectually as supposed, that out of 200 propositions in Euclid&rsquo;s twelve books only about a dozen are necessary as a preparation for modern mathematics and that the Greeks much developed geometry because they could not easily employ ordinary arithmetical methods owing to their dependence on the abacus. 695 It was further found that the sexagesimal system of degrees, minutes and seconds used by Ptolemy was of Babylonian origin and according to Herodotus (II. 109) the Greeks derived two kinds of Sun-dials and the division of the day into 12 parts from the Babylonians.696 At present such nations as England, France, Germany, U. S. S. R. and U. S. A. are the foremost nations in Science, Technology and Industry but they clung for about 1400 years to the Alma gest of Ptolemy as their astronomical Bible, were ignorant of the decimal place value system and the use of a sign for zero till the so-called &lsquo;Arabic numerals&rsquo; (borrowed from India ) were</p>

The intolerance of ignorant and bigoted priests in Europe went so far as to condemn Galileo, one of the greatest intellects in mechanics and astronomy, to por petual imprisonment at the age of 70 for no greater offence than holding fast to the Copernican theory. Hardly any parallel to such an attempt to suppress honest difference of opinion as regards heavenly bodies can be found in any non-European country claiming to have a civilization.</p>
<p>There are controversies about the relation of astronomy and astrology. The marvellous spectacle of the sky at night con taining thousands of stars of different brightness all apparently in motion&quot;round the earth, the Sun&rsquo;s annual northward and south ward passage in the sky, Full Moon and its disappearance for one day and its phases, eclipses of the Sun and the Moon, comets and falling stars&ndash;all these must have struck even the most primitive men with wonder and also with fear and fore bodings. In course of time arose astronomy and astrology. In ancient times both words had the same meaning. The Cambridge Ancient History (1925, vol. III. pp. 238-239) holds that the whole science of astronomy is due to astrology. On the other hand Prof. Neugebauer and Mr. Peter Doig see no evidence for this theory.698 In my humble opinion if we restrict ourselves to existing literatures of different peoples and eschew more con jectures and speculation, both astronomy and astrology are equally ancient and must have acted and reacted on one another in very ancient times. In the following pages some evidence will be given from Vedic literature of the simultaneous cultiva tion in India of both astronomy and astrology (particularly natural). To a modern scientist, the lucubrations of astrologers in their available works appear to be sheer nonsense. But the fundamental principle assumed by astrology that heavenly bodies</p>

<p>exert predictable influence on terrestrial things and persons is not different from the principles of astronomy or meteorology whereby one can predict tides, eclipses, storms, torrential rains, and the like which affect the world and human beings.</p>
<p>Whether the stars and planets exert some influence on earthly things is not the real question. Probably they do, but the really important question is whether astrological works and astrologers have discovered correct methods and reached correct knowledge about the influence of planets on the human mind and on the day-today activities of human beings.</p>
<p>The astronomical and astrological literature in Sanskrit falls into three slightly overlapping periods. The first period is that of the Vedic Samhitis and the Brāhmapas from the mists of antiquity to about 800 B.C. The second is represented by the Vedāngajyotisa, the Srauta, Grhya and Dharma sūtras, Manu and Yājñavalkya, Garga and Jain works like the Sūryaprajñapti and ended about the 3rd century A, D. The third period begins at the commencement of the Christian era and is represented by the works called Siddhānta and gave rise to the works of Arya bhata (born 476 A. D.), of Varāhamihira (about 475 to 550 A. D.), Brahmagupta (born in 598 A. D.) and so on. Those who want to make a deep study of the History of Hindu Astro nomy should carefully read the work in Marathi written by Shankar Balkrishna Dixit in 1896 (2nd edition in 1931 by his son). Even Thibaut who is generally chary of praising any Indian achievement in astronomy was constrained to observe that Dikshit&rsquo;s work is the richest source of Indian astro nomical material and that his treatment from Brahmagupta onwards is particularly detailed (Grundriss, p. 3). Dikshit held that the scientific system of Indian astronomy is essentially independent and rests on Indian observations. In my humble opinion this view is far sounder than the view that the scienti fic astronomy of India was derived from or was greatly influen ced by Greek astronomy. I have decided (as stated above p. 480) not to enter into detailed discussions about astronomical matters. Therefore, I shall rest content with mentioning some of the important works and contributions that should be studied by those desirous of intimate knowledge of the History of Indian Astronomy.
