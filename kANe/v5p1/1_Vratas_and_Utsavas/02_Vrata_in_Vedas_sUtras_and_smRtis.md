VRATA in Vedic Literature, Sūtras and Smrtis ; 

definition and importance of Vratas. 

After dealing with the etymology and semantic development of the word 'vrata' from the passages of the Rgveda in which the word occurs, it is now time to tarn to the other Vedic Samhitās and the Brāhmaṇas for finding out how that word is dealt with in them. Some of the Rgvedic verses occur in other Vedic Samhitās. In several such passages vrata appears to mean * divine ordinances' or 'ethical patterns of conduct'. For example, the verse35 Rg. I. 22. 19 'Mark the deeds of Visnu, the helpful friend of Indra, whereby he watches over his ordinances' occurs also in T. S. I. 3.6.2, Atharva VII. 26.6, Vāj. S. VI. 4; Rg. VIII. 11. 136 'O Agnil thou art a God that protects ordinances among (gods and) men, thou art to be praised in sacrifices' is also found in Atharva 19. 59. 1, Vāj. S. IV. 16, T.S. I. 1. 14. 4-5 and I. 2.3.1; Rg. I. 24.15 is found in Vāj. S. XII. 12 and Atharva VII. 83 (88) 3 and XVIII, 4. 69; Rg. X. 191. 3 is almost the same as Atharva37 VI. 64.2, the latter substituting the word 'vratam' for 'manaḥ' in the former and thereby indicating that 'vrata' means “resolve to undertake a religious observance'; Rg. VII. 103. 1, in which frogs that lie down silent for a year and begin to croak at the advent of the rains are com pared to brāhmaṇas observing a religious vow, occurs in the Atharyaveda IV. 15. 13; Rg. X. 12. 5 is the same as Atharva XVIII. 1. 33; Rg. X. 2.4 is almost the same as Atharva XIX. 59.2; Rg. I. 84. 12 is equal to Atharva XX. 109. 3; in all of which the words vratam and vratāni occur. Agni is frequently called 

vratapāḥ' in the Rgveda (V. 2.8, VI. 8.%, VIII. 11. 1, X. 32.6) and also Sūrya is so called (Rg. I. 83.5.). In the other Samhitās Agni is styled ‘vratapā' as well as 'vratapati' (protector or lord of vratas). Atharva XX. 25.5 (Sūryo vratapā) is the same as Rg. I. 83.5, Atharva XIX. 59.1 (tvam-Agne vratapā asi) is same as

Vrata in other Samhitās 

Rg. VIII. 11.1; Vaj. S. I. 5.38 says 'O Agni, lord of vratas! I shall undertake a religious observance (or obligation). May I be able to carry it out, may that (undertaking) of mine succeed; here do I approach truth from untruth'. The T. S. I. 3.4.3 also styles Agni 'vratapati'. Here and there Vedic Samhitas other than the Rgveda do employ the word 'vrata' in the sense of 'ordin ances of a god or of gods' as in T. S. IV. 3. 11.1,2,3 or Atharva VII. 40 (41). 1, VII. 68 (70). 1 ('Sarasvati vratesu te'). But in many places in all the Samhitās (other than the Rgveda) and in the Brāhmapas and Upanisads generally the ordinary senses of vrata are two, viz. (1) religious observance of vow, or restric tions as to food and behaviour when one has undertaken a reli gious vow, or (2) the special food, that is prescribed for susten ance when a person is engaged in a religious rite or undertaking, such as cow's milk, yaragu. (barley gruel) or the mixture of hot milk and curds (called āmikṣā). Both meanings of vrata are ĝiven by Yāska in his Nirukta39. A few passages from the Samhitās and Brāhmaṇas are cited below to illustrate both meanings. For the first meaning, vide the following: T. S. II. 5.5.6 'thist0 is his vrata (vow); he should not speak what is untrue, should not eat flesh, should not approach a woman (for sexual intercourse), nor should his apparel be washed with water impregnated with cleansing salt; for, all these things the gods do not do'; T. S. V.7.6.141 birds are indeed fire; when one who has performed Agnicayana eats the (flesh of) birds, he would be eating fire and would meet with disaster (or distress); (therefore) he should observe this vrata (not to eat bird's flesh) for a year,

for vrata does not extend beyond a year'. The śānkbayana 42 Br. VI. 6 prescribes 'He has to observe the vrata, viz. that he should not see the rising sun nor the setting sun'. The Tai. Ā. I. 26.6 states "this is the vrata for him (for him who has per formed Āruṇaketuka-cayana), viz. he should not run while it is raining, should not urinate or void ordure in water, should not spit, should not bathe naked, should not step over lotus leaves or gold, should not eat (the flesh) of a tortoise'. 

The Bṛhadārangakopaniṣad (I. 5. 21-23) remarks "now begins the consideration about vrata; Prajāpati indeed created the organs, which when created, vied with each other; speech stood fast (by the view) 'I shall only speak' (and do nothing else).'... Therefore one should perform only one vrata, viz. one should only breathe in and should emit breath, for fear that otherwise (if one were to engage in the activities of the other organs) wicked Death may seize him”:43 It is stated in the Tai. Up. III. 7-10 'one should not speak ill of food; that is the vrata, ...one should not shun food, that is the vrata...one should prepare much food...one should not refuse residence to a man whatever (when he comes as a stranger seeking shelter), that is the vrata; therefore one should secure plenty of food by some method or other.'44 In the Chāndogyopaniṣad (adhyāya II, khandas 13-21) the words 'tad vratam' occur several times in relation to the injunctions when one is engaged in the upāsanā of several Sāmans not to complain about the hot sun, raining cloud, seasons, lokas (worlds), domestic animals, brāhmaṇas and the injunction not to eat marrow for a year (or not to eat it at all). 

A few passages from the Vedic Literature may be cited for the second meaning of vrata (food for sustenance &c.) men 

42. 74 ang hari ni al . T. VI. 6. $. IV. 1. 3 refers to this text and Sabara remarks that these are fattigas, tbat they are 

Tu and not at and that this text lays down a restriction that one should make a resolve aot to see the rising or setting sun. 319. y. &. I. 11.31, 20 ( V auf Tria ), AZ 4, 37, HET XII. 10-12 make this and other rules applicable to all स्नातकs.

tioned above. The T. S. (VI. 2. 5. 1.) remarks 45 'he (diksita) observes the vrata taking the milk from one udder, then from two udders, then from three, then from four; this is called kṣurapavi (razor-edge) vrata; barley gruel is the vrata of a ksatriya (when dikṣita), āmiksā (hot milk and curds mixed) of a vaiśya.' The Satapatha Br. provides 46 that a dīksita (one who has under gone the consecration ceremony for a vedic sacrifice) should subsist on milk. In another place the Satapatha says ‘for him he heats vrata! (i. e. the food or milk). The Ait. Br. also provides 47 that the diksita first takes (the milk) from four udders as vrata on the Upasad days, then from three &c. Vide T. A. II. 8 48 milk is the vrata of a brāhmana (sacrificer); yavāgū of a ksatriya and āmiksā of a vaisya. 

It appears that in the times of the Brāhmaṇas the word. vrata ' had come to have two secondary senses derived from the sense of religious observance or obligation'; viz. 'a proper course or pattern of conduct for a person', and 'an upavāsa' i. e. the sacrificer's staying at night near Gārhapatya fire or fasting. As illustrative of the first may be cited a passage that occurs towards the end of the Ait. Br. viz. 'this is the vrata for him (for the king who has performed what is called 'brahmanah parimarah') that he should not sit down before his enemy sits down (but should do so after), if he thinks (from information received) that his enemy is standing the king should also stand up; he should not lie down before his enemy (does so); if the king thinks that (the enemy) has sat down he may then himself sit down; he should never sleep before his enemy sleeps; if he thinks that the enemy is awake he should himself keep awake;

On the first day of upasad in the evening the milk of all four udders is to be used by the sacrificer, of three on the 2nd day in the morning, of two in the evening of 2nd day and of one udder on 3rd day morning.

"14-E 

even if the enemy has his head as hard as a stone (or has a stone helmet on his head), he (the king who performs the jarimara) quickly overthrows him'.4) 

The other secondary meaning of crust: seems to be uprūsa (i. e. Yajamāna's passing the night in the Darsa-isti and the Pūrṇamāsa-isti near the Gārhapatya and other fres, or reducing his intake of food or fasting): " that he performs uparāsa in Darśa and Pūrṇamāsa istis is so because the gods do not partake of the offering made by one who has not undergone vrata; there fore he undergoes upavāsa with the thought the gods may partake of my offering'" (Ait. Br. VII. II )5) 

Coming to the Srautasūtras, 51 the two principal meanings of vrata mentioned above often figure in them. For example, the Ap. Sr. S. IV. 2. 5-7, IV. 16. 11, V. 7. 6 and 16, V. 8. 1, V. 25. 2-20, IX. 3. 15, XI. 1. 7 and IX. 18. 9, Asv. Sr. S. II. 2. 7, III. 13. 1-2, San. Sr. S. II. 3. 26 may be referred to for the first meaning and Ap. Sr. S. X. 12. 4, X. 17.6, XI. 15. 3 and 6 for the second (viz. food or milk &c.). The Grhyasatras and Dharamasutras also present the same meaning of vrata. For sample, the Āśv. Gr. III. 10. 5-7 states : these are the vratas for him, viz. he should not bathe at night, nor bathe naked, nor run while it is raining 

49. तस्य व्रतम् । न द्विषतः पूर्व उपविशेद्यदि तिष्ठन्तं मन्येत तिष्ठेतैव न द्विषतः पूर्वः संविशेद्यद्यासीनं मन्येतासीतैब न द्विषतः पूर्वः प्रस्त्रप्याद्यदि जायतं मन्येत जानियादेवापि ह यद्यस्याश्ममूर्धा द्विषन्भवति क्षिप्रं हैवनं स्तृणुते । ऐ. प्रा. VIII. 28.

The ते सं I. 6. 7.3 appears to refer to both these significances of upavasa 'उपास्मिन्छो यक्ष्यमाणे देवता वसन्ति य एवं विद्वानग्निमुपस्तृणाति ... यदना श्वानुपवसेपितृदेवत्यः स्यात् ।'. सायण explains on ऐ. ब्रा 'गार्हपत्यादिसमीपे यो वासः स उपचासः। यद्वा देवा अस्यापि यज्ञे समीपे वसन्तीत्येतदीयोनुष्ठानसङ्कल्प उपवासः। ... यद्वा ग्राम्याशनपरित्याग उपवासः। तत्परित्यज्यारण्याशनरूपं नियनं स्वीकुर्यात् । अनाश्वान् is 

n. sing. of अनाश्चम (one who has not eaten, one who is fasting).

Meaning of vrata in sūtras 

27 

&c.; the Pār. Gṛ. II. 8 says that the sniitaka has to follow for three days after sumūrartını certain observances such as not eating flesh, not using earthen vessels for drinking water, not seeing women, sūdras, corpses and crows, not speaking with Śūdras, not urinating nor voiding ordure nor spitting in front of the sun, or he should simply speak the truth (instead of observing the other requirements of this passage). Gautama (VIII. 15), Śāökhāyana-gihya (II. 11-12), Gobhila-gphya (III. 1. 26-31 ) and others mention certain irtas (now obsolete) which every Vedic student was to undergo. Vide H. of Dh. vol. II, pp. 370–373 for descriptions of these. The Ap. Dh. S. H. 1.1.1 ff specifies52 the observances to be followed by the husband and wife from the day of their marriage such as eating only twice in the day, not eating to satiety, fasting on parvan days. Similarly, the Ap. Dh. S. (I. 11. 30. 6, I. 11. 31 ) sets out the observances for snūtakas (atha snātaka-vratāni). Pāṇini has a special sūtra 'vrate' (III. 2. 80 ) for explaining the formation of words from trata with the affix in (nini) preceded by a substantive such as 'sthandilaśāyin' and 'aśrāddha-bhoji' (one who has taken the vow of not par taking of śrāddha food). Pānini (III. 1. 21 )53 also teaches the formation of a denominative verb from vrata in the sense of 

doing' (vratuyati vratun karoti). It is the Kāśikā that adda a vārtıka (absent in the Mahabhāsya) that the verb so derived expresses both the oating of food and the eschewing of it., 

As prayascittas (expiations) involved the observance of several strict rules they came to be called vratas in Manu (XI. 117, 170,176,181), Yājñavalkya (III. 251, 252, 254, 258), Saṅkha (17.6, 22, 42, 61, 62 ) and other smitis. In the Mahābhārata the word vrata is mainly used in the sense of a religious undertaking or vow in which one has to observe certain restrictions about food or one's general behaviour. Vide Vanaparva 296. 3, Udyoga 39. 71-72, Santi 35.39, Anuśāsana 103. 34. It was also applied in the epic to a course or pattern of conduct or behaviour not necessarily religious. For example, in the Sabhāparva 58. 16 Yudhisthira says that it has been his constant vow that he would not refuse dice-play when he was challenged to it.54 Apart from

the secondary applications of the word vrata, its principal meaning from at least the first centuries of the Christian era onwards has been that of a religious undertaking or yow, observed on a certain tithi, week day, month or other period, for securing some desired object by the worship of a deity, usually accompanied by restrictions as to food and behaviour. This is the sense in which the word vrata will be used in this section. Vratas may be expiatory (i. e. they will be prāyaścittas) or obligatory (such as the vratas of a brahmacārin or snātaka or householder) or they may be voluntary and self-imposed for securing some specific end. Expiatory vratas have already been dealt with in the 4th volume of the H. of Dh. under Prāyaścittas. The vratas of a brahmacārin, of snātaka and of the householder have been treated of in volume II of the H. of Dh. Vratas or vows that are more or less self-imposed will be discussed in this section of the 5th volume. 

Vows are found in all religions. The Old Testament and the New Testament both bear witness to the sacredness of vows, vide Isaiah 19.21, Job 22.27, Psalms 22. 25, Acts 21. 23. The Jainas have five great vows and the Buddhists have the pañca-śīlas. 

A great deal of discussion is found in the medieval digests on a comprehensive definition of vrata. Sabara5s on Jai. VI. 2. 20 arrives at the conclusion that by vrata is meant a mental activity, which is a resolve in the form “I shall not do this" and gives as an illustration the sentence one should not see the rising or setting sun'. Medhātithi on Manu IV. 13 seems to accept this. The Agnipurāṇa56 provides 'a restrictive rule declared by the śāstras is called vrata, which is also regarded as tapas; restraint of senses and other rules are but special incidents of vrata; vrata is called tapas because it causes hardship to the performer (of the vrata) and it is also called niyama since there in one has to restrain the several organs of sense'. Manu II. 3

Definition of vrata 

declaress7 ' resolve is the root of desires, of sacrifices, of vratas and the characteristics called yamas-all are known to spring from rosolve'. But every sankalpa entertained by any person whatever is not and cannot be called vrata. It may be noted that the Amarakośa holds 58 that the words 'niyama'and 'vrata'are synonyms and that the latter consists of fast and the like that produce merit (punja), while the Ap. Dh. S. I. 2, 57 remarks that the word tapis is applied to the rules of conduct prescribed for a brahmacarin (' niyamesu tapahsabdah'). The Mitaksara 59 on Yaj. I. 129 appears to indicate that vrata is a mental resolve to do something or refrain from doing something, both being enjoined as duties. It is therefore that Srīdatta (probably taking his cue from Sabara and the Mit.) in his Samaya-pradipa defines vrata as 'a definite resolve relating to a certain matter held as obligatory' and proceeds to lay down that it may be positive (being in the form 'I must do it') or negative (I must not do this'). He further holds that a resolve 60 made with the addition of a condition not enjoined by śāstras is not a vrata: 0. g. if a man were to declare that he would observe a fast if his father would not forbid it and that otherwise he would not, this would not be a vrata and that, since sankalpa is the principal matter in a vrata, if a man of weak intellect or an ignorant man observes a fast without sankalpa, it would be simply so

III. 312-313 mention ten yamas (ब्रह्मचर्य, ठया. अहिंसा. दम &c ) and ten niyamas (such as नान, मौन, उपवास, शौच &c.), while the योगसूत्र mentions only five यम (अहिंसासत्यास्तेयब्रह्मचर्यापरिग्रहाः यमाः) and five नियम (शौचसन्तोषतपास्वाध्यायेश्वरप्रणिधानानि नियमाः). मनु IV. 204 and Atri verse 47 provide that one must observe yamas always (i e. they are para. mount duties), while niyamas are not so. The वायुपुराण (16. 17-19) enumerates a large number of नियमs (and includes अहिंसा, अस्तेय and ब्रह्मचर्य under them ). The एकादशीतत्त्व after quoting मनु II. 3 explains 'अनेन कर्मणा इदमिष्टं फलं साध्यते इत्येवंविषया बुद्धिः सङ्कल्पस्तदनन्तरमिष्टसाधनतया अवगते तस्मिन् इच्छा जायते ततस्तदर्थ प्रयत्नं कुर्वीत इत्येवं यज्ञाः सङ्कल्पसम्भवाः ।।

much physical hardship but no vrata. The Krtyaratnākara 61 mentions several definitions of vrata given by its predecessors, one of which by Deveśvara was that 'a vrata is that which is included in the vratakānda'. This last is a desperate effort at definition and leaves the inquirer hardly wiser than before. That sankalpa is closely connected with vrata cannot be gainsaid and follows from a verse of Laghu-Viṣnu 62 'the choosing of stviks is the starting point of a sacrifice, sankalpa that of vrata and of a japa of mantras (in honour of a deity)'. Sūlapāṇi defined vrata on almost the same lines as Sridatta. Laksmi dhara in his Krtyakalpataru on vrata does not define vrata but begins his treatment of vrata with vratapraśamsā. Prof. K. V. Rangaswami Aiyangar in his Introduction to the Vratakāṇda of the Krtyakalpataru remarks (p. XXIII) 'Raghu nandana in his Vrata-tattva also avoids any attempt to define vrata'. Prof. Aiyangar did not notice that Raghunandana discusses the question of the definition of vrata in his Ekādasi tattva (Jiv. vol. II. p. 7) and therefore he did not repeat the definition in the Vratatattva. Raghunandana mentiong63 the definitions of vrata given by Nārāyana and Sridatta, does not agree that vrata is a sankalpa but holds that vrata means various rites about which a resolve is made and also that vrata is a niyama (a restrictive rule ) enjoined by the śāstra, charac terised by uparūsa and the like and not every niyama such as *stukālābhigāmi syāt' (Yāj. I. 79, Manu III. 45). The Vrata prakāśa (a part of Viramitrodaya) defines vrata as 'a special sankalpa concerning what is well known to the learned as vrata,' just as mantras are those that are well-known among the learned as mantras.64 The Dharmasindhu (p. 9) defines vrata as a kind

Definition of vrata

of religious rite consisting of pūja and the like. Although at the root of every vrata and as an urge for it, there must be a sankalpa it appears to me that Raghunandana and the Dharma sindhu properly represent the popular meaning of vrata. A vrata comprehends several items such as snāna (bath), the morn ing prayer (prātaḥ-sandhyā), sankalpa, homa, pījū of the deity or deities in whose honour or for securing whose favour the vrata is undertaken, upavāsa, feeding of brāhmanas, maidens or married women or the poor and helpless (according to the nature of the vrata), gifts (of cows, money, apparel, sweetmeats &c.) and the observance of certain rules of conduct during the period of the vrata. Some of these matters will be dealt with in detail later on, but a few may be disposed off here. Some writers relying on Sātātapa said that before a vrata was undertaken a Viddhi-śrāddha must be performed.65 The Agnipurāna (175. 12) states that one who undertakes a vrata must always take a bath (every day), should subsist on a limited quantity of food, should worship and honour his guru, gods and brāhmaṇas and should eschew ksāra, ksaudra, lavana, honey and meat. Devala states67 without partaking of food (the previous night), after bathing and concentrating one's mind, one should, after invok ing the Sun and other deities to be present, commence a vrata in the morning'. The general tendency of medieval writers to go on adding details to what was originally brief is seen at work here also. The Vratakālaviveka says that before sapkalpa, there

should be remembrance of Nārāyana and namaskāra to him, as laid down by Yogiyājñavalkya. There is difference of opinion about the worship of Ganesa.68 The Vratakālaviveka quotes the Padmapurāṇa for the order in which the several deities are to be worshipped and honoured after sankalpa and refutes the idea that the worship of Ganesa should always precede the worship of other deities. Though the general rule is that69 the sankalpa of a vrata is to be made in the morning, still there are some passages to the contrary. For example, the Bhavisyapurāṇa70 (Uttara 11. 6-8) provides that on the evening of Āsādha Full Moon one should declare a resolve as follows “from tomorrow for one month in Srāvana, I shall take a bath, observe brulmacarya, take one meal only after evening, sleep on the ground, will be compassionate to all living beings'. 

There is a difference between homa and pūja. A homa with Vedic mantras, according to ancient authorities, cannot be performed by women and śūdras. Though theoretically the three varnas were entitled to perform homa with Vedic mantras some learned brāhmaṇas held the view that in the Kaliyuga no proper ksatriyas and vaisyas existed.71_Even as to Sudra 72 some writers like Kamalakarabhatta went so far that a śūdra could not read and study open purānas but should only listen to their

recital by brāhmanas. The result was that most people per formed only pūjā and not homa in Agni. According to most writers the homa was to be performed in honour of that deity for whose favour the vrata was performed. According to Vardha māna and a few others the homa in a vrata may be in honour of the deity of the vrata or may be a vyāhștihoma.73 It is stated by the Agnipurāṇa 74 that there is japa, homa and also gifts at the end of all vratas in general and the Visnudharmottara observes that those who perform upavāsavrata should inaudibly mutter the mantras of that deity, should meditate on that deity, should listen to stories about that deity, should worship the image of that deity, should take the names of that deity and listen to others singing the names. Pūrvamimāṁsā writers made a distinction between homa, yūga and dāna. Sabara 75 on Jai. IV. 2. 28 puts the distinction in a nutshell by saying that'giving up what belongs to one is common to all the three, but yāga means simply giving up something intending it for a deity and accompanying it with a mantra; in homa there is in addition the throwing of a thing in fire; dāna consists in abandoning a thing that belongs to one and creating the owner ship of another in that thing.' In another place (on Jai. IX. 1. 6), Sabara refers to the argument that yāga is nothing but the worship of a deity (api ca yāgo nāma devatāpūjā). 

Manu II. 176 and Yāj. I. 99, 100, 102 show that Devapūjā is different from76 homa and was performed after the latter according to Marici and Hārīta quoted in the Smṛticandrikā, Smrti-muktā

phala and other digests. Certain matters connected with devapūjā such as the questions whether images of gods were worshipped in the times of the Rgveda and the Samhitās, whether the worship of images arose spontaneously among the Vedic Aryans or whether it was derived from some other race or sectarians or from sūdras and Dravidian tribes, have already been dealt with at some length in H. of Dh. vol. II. pp. 705-712. Similarly, descriptions of devapūjā and the several items and stages in the procedure of devapūjā have been set out in H. of Dh. vol. II. pp. 726--735. A few matters either not set out there at all or briefly set out may be spoken of here. It should be noted that ordinarily there are 16 upacārasn (items of showing honour) in the procedure of devapūjā, but they may be increased to 36 or 38 or reduced to 14, 12, 10 or 5 and there is no complete unanimity on the question of the names of the 16 upacaras and their order. The Brahmavaivartapurāṇa sets out what the sixteen, twelve and five upacāras are. The Vratarka quotes Ferses enumerating 38, 16, 10 or 5 upacāras. If a person is unable to offer even five upacāras then he should offer two, viz. sandalwood paste and flowers and if he cannot do even that, then he may offer only devotion. So says the Kalikapurana quoted in Varsakriya-kaumudi p. 157. From Sabara's bhāṣya on Jai. V. 1. 4 it follows that long before his day (not later than 4th century A. D.) the order (krama) of the upacāras had been settled.78 Medieval works like the Vratāska (folio 23 b ff) and V. K. K. pp. 200-201 

77. For 38 उपचारs vide व्रतराज p. 44. 36 उपचारs are enumerated in एकादशीतत्त्व p. 58 quoting from आह्निकचिन्तामणि. They are not set out here for reasons of space. The 16 उपचारs quoted from प्रपञ्चसार by व.क्रि. कौ. P 156 and ए. त. p. 59 are : आसनं स्वागतं पाद्यमय॑माचमनीयकम् । मधुपर्काचमस्नान घसनाभरणानि च। सुगन्धसुमनोधूपदीपनैवेद्यवन्दनम् । प्रयोजयेदर्चनायामुपचारांश्च षोडश । अर्घ्यपाद्याचमनकमधुपर्काचमा अपि । गन्धादयो निवेद्यान्ता उपचारा दश क्रमात् । गन्धादयो निवेद्यान्ताः पूजा पञ्चोपचारिकी। उपचारैर्यथाशक्ति देवतामन्वहं यजेत् ।.

The व. क्रि. को. p 156 notes that there is slight difference in the order in which some apacāras are offered '

(quoting Nrsimhapurāna 62. 8-14) prescribe for all vratas in general the recital of each of the sixteen versos of the Purusasūkta (Rg. X. 90) with each of the sixteen upacāras in order (viz. āvāhana, āsana, pādya, arghya, ācamaniyaka, snāna, vastra, yajñopavīta, anulepana (or gandha), puspa, dhūpa, dipa, nai vedya, tāmbūla, daksiṇā, pradaksiṇā); while some works associate with each of these one or more Paurāṇika mantras also. It should not be supposed that these upacaras (particularly puspa, gandha, dhūpa, dīpa and naivedya) were absent in the Vedic age and came into prominence at a very late stage by being borrowed from non-Aryan people. The Aśvins are described as wearing wreaths of blue lotuses (puskarasrajā) in Rg X. 184. % and Atharva III. 22. 4; the Maruts also are spoken of as wearing wreaths (Rg. V. 53. 4). In numerous passages the Rgveda refers to the casting of offerings (havya) mixed with clarified butter in Agni (e. g. Rg. III. 59. 1 and 5).79 The gods are even asked to eat apūpa, purodāśa, dhānā, milk, curds, honey &c. in Rg. III. 53. 8, III. 52. 1-7, IV. 32. 16, VIII. 91. 2, in Atharva XVIII. 4. 16–26. The underlying conception in these passages is the same as that involved in offering naivedya to an image. In the Satapatha Br. So the word upacara appears to have been used in the sense of 'honour' or 'mode of showing honour.' In the Tai. Ā. X. 40 81 occurs a mantra called 'Medha-janana' which was recited in the ear of a child in the jātakarma 'may god Savitr, goddess Sarasvati and the gods Aśvins wearing wreaths of blue lotuses produce in you intelligence'. There is evidence that long before the time of the gphyasūtras several of the sixteen upacārag were well-known. The Nighanṭu (III. 14) enumerates 44 verbs that have the sense of worship' among which pujayati' is

included. The Nirukta in explaining the word 'supāṇiḥ' occurring in Rg. III. 33. 6 states that the word 'pāṇi' is 82 derived from 'paṇ' to offer pūjā and supports this derivation by saying that people worship gods by joining together their hands. It is clear that the Nighanṭu treated 'pūjayati' as a verb occurring in the Vedas and that folding the hands (i. e. namaskāra) was a item of worship long before the Nirukta. While explaining the word 'saparyan' occurring in Rg. III. 31. 1 the Nirukta offers 'pūjayan' as a synonym. From Pāṇini 83 V. 3. 99 and the Mahābhāṣya thereon it is clearly seen that in the days of the former images of gods were made for sale and also for worship. Patañjali expressly says that the rule applies to images which were worshipped and which gave livelihood to the Pujaris of those images and not to images made for sale. Vide also Mahābhāṣya on Pāṇini I. 1. 25. The Āśv. Gr. 84 provides that when madhu parka is to be offered to a styik, an ācārya, a bride groom, a king or a snātaka or a relative (like father-in-law, paternal or maternal uncle), a seat, water for washing the feet, argbya water, water for ācamana, honey mixture, a cow are to be announced to the guest three times in each case. In another place, the same sūtra 85 speaks of the presentation of sandal-wood paste, flowers, incense, lamp and garment to the brāhmaṇas invited at a śrāddha. In these two passages alone nine of the 16 upacāras are mentioned. The word pūjā took on a secondary meaning, viz. (honour without use of gandha, puspa &c.) even in the times of Dharmasūtrās (vide Ap. Dh. S. I. 4. 14. 9, 'nityā ca pūjā yathopadeśam'). Yāj. (I. 229 ff) mentions in srāddha āvāhana, arghya, gandha, mālya, dhūpa, dipa &c. When the worship of images became common, the

Origin of pājā 

upacaras that had been offered for showing honour and worship to worthy men were by a natural analogy employed in it. In my view the theory that pūjā and the upacāras were borrowed from the Dravidians or some non-Aryan people cannot be held to be proved, is quite speculative and that 'pūjā' of images of gods was an indigenous development. Medieval writers were careful to point out that there was no essential difference between yāga (vedic or other sacrifice) and pājā, as in both there was the giving of some substance intending it for a deity. Prof. J. Charpentier contributed a paper on the meaning and etymology of pūjā' to the Indian Antiquary vol. 56. pp. 93-99 and pp. 130 ff. I demur to his conclusions. He points out that 'pu' in Tamil means 'flower', that the word pūjā is derived from Dravidian 

pūcu', 'pūsu' to paint or daub' (p. 133) and asks the question why red colour is used in the worship of Gods; he himself answers it by suggesting that it was a substitute for blood. There is no reason whatever for assuming that pūjā was derived from 'pu' and not from 'puspa' (flower) which was known to the Rgveda (II. 13. 7 'puspinih'and X. 97.3 'puspavatih'). There is no sound reason to assume that 'pūcu' (to paint) existed thousands of years ago in Dravidian languages and was not a more recent acquisi tion, when the word pūjā can be traced a thousand years before any existing literary work in any Dravidian language.86 

Some works on vratas treat at great length the several upacāras, particularly flowers that should be offered to the various images worshipped, the consequences of offering those flowers, the various kinds of fragrant substances (gandha) to be offered or the incense to be burnt, the nature of the foods &c. Vide for example, Hemādri (on vrata) vol. I, pp. 49-51, Krtyaratnakara pp. 70-71, 77-79, Varsakriyakaumudi pp. 156-181. For reasons of space it is not possible to treat of these matters here. Besides, H. of Dh. vol. II. (pp. 731-734) deals at some length with the unguents, the flowers, the lamps, the naivedya to be offered in the ordinary devapūjā. A few matters not mentioned there are set out here for the sake of completeness of treatment. The Sm. C. 1. p. 201 quotes the Padmapurāṇa87 to the effect that sandal wood is holy among unguents (gandha), agaru (Agalochum)

is better than sandalwood, dark agaru is still better and saffron is preferable to dark agaru. Hemādri (on vrata vol. I. pp. 43–44) quotes passages from several purāṇas defining88 catuḥsama as tvak i. e. cinnamon, patraka ( cassia leaf), lavanga i, e. cloves, and saffron (or two parts of musk, four of sandalwood, three of saffron and one of camphor) and sarvagandha as saffron, sandalwood, uśira (fragrant roots of a plant), mustā, lāmajja (root of fragrant grass), camphor and the three perfumed things viz. tvak, cardamom and patraka and Yaksakardama as camphor, agiru, musk, sandalwood and kakkola. The Agnipurāṇa (chap. 202.1) first states that Hari is pleased by the offerings of flowers, perfumes, incense, lamps and naivedya and then specifies the flowers that are fit for offering to the deities and that are unfit (verses 2-15). The Kalpataru on vrata (pp. 180–181) quotes the Bhavisyapurāṇa (Brāhmaparva 197.1-11) for stating the consequences of using various flowers in worship, viz. worship with mālati flowers leads the worshipper in the presence of god, worship with karavira flowers confers health and incomparable prosperity, by the flowers of Mallikā the worshipper becomes endowed with all pleasures, with pundarika (lotuses) he secures bliss and lasting wealth, with flowers of the fragrant kubjaka he secures highest prosperity, with lotuses (white and blue) he secures spotless fame, with various mukurakas (Jasminium zambac) he is freed from disease, worship with Mandāra flowers destroys all kinds of leprosy, and with bilya flowers he obtains wealth, with arka flowers the Lord Sun confers blessings, with a garland of bakula flowers the worshipper has a beautiful daughter, the Sun worshipped with Kimśuka flowers does away with trouble, with Agastya flowers the deity gives success and worship with lotuses gives a beautiful wife, with vanamālā the worshipper becomes free from tiredness; the worshipper of the Sun with Asoka flowers makes no mistakes, and the Sun worshipped with japā (china rose) flowers frees the worshipper from trouble. About dhūpa (incense burnt in worship) a good deal is said in the digests. The Kalpataru

(on vrata pp. 182-183)99 observes as follows: The Sun comes near (i. e. favours) a worshipper who burns sandalwood and confers desired objects when one burns agaru as dhūpa; one who desires health should burn guggulu; the Sun is always pleased by the use of pindanga (i. e. silhaka) and confers health, wealth and the highest bliss; a man secures blessedness by using kundaka (the exudation of sallaki) as dhūpa and trade becomes fruitful by using srivāsaka (sarala) as dhūpa and one gets wealth by burning rasa (myrrh) and sarjarasa (resin of the sal tree). Bāṇa in the Kādambari (pārvārdha, para 56) refers to the practice of burning guggulu in the temple of Candikā. Kalpataru (on vrata pp. 6-7), Hemādri (on vrata) vol. I. pp. 50-51, Krtya ratnākara p. 78 quote several verses from the Bhavisyapurāna defining dhūpas called 'amrta', 'ananta', yaksānga, mahānga. The Bhavisyapurāṇa %0 remarks: the jūti is the best among flowers, kundaka is the best dhūpa, saffron is best among fragrant substances, sandalwood among unguents; ghee is best for lighting lamps and modaka sweets among naivedya foods. It may be noted that the burning of guggulu and other substances had a practical end in view, viz. the destruction of fleas and bees. 

It is no doubt true that in most vratas brāhmaṇas are to be fed, but one should not run away with the idea that the blind, the poor and the helpless were altogether forgotten. In the case of many vratas it is expressly provided that food should be given to the blind, the poor and the helpless. In describing the Aviyoga vrata, both the Kalpataru (on vrata p. 75) and Hemādri quote a long passage from the Kālikāpurāna in which it is provided that on the day of the vrata tasteful and well-flavoured food and drink without stint should be distributed to the helpless, the blind and

The Bhavisya (Uttara, 22. 33-34)93 recommends that one observing a vrata should provide food for the blind, the distressed and the helpless according to his means, As in the case 94 of śrāddhas, particularly at Gayā, the Purāṇas often enjoin lavish expenditure on vratas and condemn stinginess or spending less on them than one is able to spend. Vide Matsya 100.36. The Bhavisyottara 95 on Ubhayadvādaśīvrata states the performer of Ubhayadvādaśīvrata being solely devoted to Krsna should not be tricky (spend less) in spending wealth'. In respect of Aviyogaprata the Kālikā-purāna provides the performer free from trickiness about wealth should give an equivalent to the brāhmaṇas or the couple if he is unable (to give pearls and precious stones)'. Vide also Padma VI. 39. 21, Matsya 62. 34, 93. 109,95. 32,98. 12. 

There are certain virtues that the person undergoing a vrata has to cultivate. The Agnipurāṇa speaks% of ten virtues that

Virtues required in all vratas

must be cultivated as common to all vratas viz. 'forbearance, truthfulness, compassion, charity, purity (of body and mind), curbing the organs of sense, worship of deities (or images), offerings into fire, contentment, not depriving another of his property. This ten-fold dharma is declared as common to all vratas.' Devala prescribes : brahmacarya (celibacy), purity, truthfulness and giving up of flesh-eating—these four are the highest (virtues) in vratas. Brahmacarya is lost by looking at (stranger) women, touching them and engaging in talk with them, but not by sexual intercourse with one's wife during the allowed days after her monthly illness'. The Nāradiyapurāṇa remarks 'brahmacarya is prescribed for being observed in all vratas and it is declared that generally sacrificial food is eaten'. Havisyānna is variously defined. Manu” says 'the food proper for hermits (such as nivūra), milk, juice of soma plant, flesh that has not become putrid, and aksaralavana (natural salt) these are declared to be (fit) sacrificial food by nature'. Though flesh was offered in śrāddhas in the times of the soveral early amṛtis such as that of Yāj. flesh must be excluded from the list of proper foods in the case of vratas owing to the express provi sions contained in Devala-smrti (cited above) and others. Vide H. of Dh. vol. IV. p. 149 n. 343 for havisya food. The Krtyaratna kara”quotes a long passage from the Samayapradipa on what food should be partaken in vratas viz. 'first come yavas (barley), on failure of them vrihi ( rice), on failure of this, other food except 

māsa (black beans), kodrava, gram, masura (a kind of pulse), cina and kapittha'. There are somewhat conflicting passages in the several Purāṇas about the foods that are acceptable or

should be rejected. For example, the Agnipurana100 ( in 175. 12) first states that ksara, lavana, honey and flesh should be eschewed in vrata, then (in 175. 13-14) includes among ksāra all cereals in pods except sesame and mudga, and among corn wheat and kodravas and several others are included in kṣāra group (i. e. they are to be eschewed in Vrata) and proceeds (175. 14-15) 'rice, sastika (corn that ripens in sixty days from the date of sowing), mudga, kalaya (peas), sesame and yava, śyāmāka (millet), nivāra (wild rice grains), wheat and others are beneficial (i. e. allowed) in vratas, while one should give up (in vrata) kūṣmānda (pumpkin gourd), alābu (bottle gourd), vārtāka (egg plant), pālanki (a kind of vegetable) and pūtikā. The Padmapurāṇa 102 provides that one who is observing nakta vrata must observe six things, viz. havisya meals, bath, truthful ness, small quantity of food, worship of Agni and sleeping on the ground (not on a cot). The Bhujabala 102 says: all should avoid while observing vrata the use of bell metal (vessel), flesh, masura, gram, kodrava, vegetables, honey and the food cooked in another's house. Harita lays 103 down what should be avoided on the day of vrata: one should avoid on the fast day talk with one guilty of heavy sins, heterodox sectarians and atheists and speak ing what is untrue and obscene. The Sāntiparva says 'one engaged in vrata should not converse with women, sūdras and patita'. The Bșhadyogi-Yājñavalkyasmrti 104 observes: one

Praise of vratas 

should not talk at the time of japa or vrata or homa and the like to women, sūdras, patita, sectarians, a woman in her monthly illness; if there be a failure in the restraint of speech (with these) in japa and the rest, he should recite a mantra addressed to Visnu or remember Visnu who is imperishable. 

The Purāṇas extol, as in the case of pilgrimages, the performance of vratas to the skies. Certain vratas like those to be undergone by a Vedic student had ceased to be in vogue and vratas associated with Vedic sacrifices also had become rare in the centuries before the Christian era. In the grhya and dharma sūtras and in ancient smrtis like those of Manu and Yājñavalkya what were called vratas in the Purāṇas did not occupy any very prominent position. During the early centuries of the Christian era Buddhism and Jainism were influential rivals of the ancient sacrificial system. In order to wean away common people from those two schisms it is very probable that learned followers of the Vedic system hit upon the glorification of vratas and promised heaven and otherworldly and spiritual rewards to those who performed vratas that were com paratively easy and within reach of all instead of sacrifices and also adopted some of the practices of common folks as vratas, e. g. kukkuṭi-markati-vrata in Bhavisyottara 46. 1-43, Sitala vrata (Vratārka folio 111 b-113 b, N. S. p. 123). The Brahma purāṇa105 says 'the reward that is secured by the worship of the Sun for a single day cannot be secured by hundreds of Vedic sacrifices or by brāhmaṇas to whom the fees stated in the texts are paid'. The Padmapurāṇa106 extols Jayantivrata by saying that in the body of the man who performs it all holy places and deities reside. The Garudapurāṇa107 quoted by Hemādri states that the Kāñcanapurivrata described by it is more purifying than even the Ganges, Kuruksetra, Kāśi and Puskara. The Bhavisya-purāṇa (Uttara 7.1) provides that a man crosses easily the deep ocean of hells by means of the boat of vratas, vpavāsas

and niyamas. In the Mahābhārata108 ( and the Padmapurāṇa VI. 53. 4-6) it is stated that the Vedic rites and rites prescribed by Manu cannot be performed in Kaliyuga and that therefore it declares to Yudhisthira something that would be an easy remedy, requiring little wealth and causing little trouble but securing great rewards and that would be the essence of Purāṇas, viz. one should not eat on the Ekādasi of both fortnights; he who does not eat food on Ekadasi does not go to hell. About the Ubhaya dvādaśīvrata described in the Bhavisyapurāṇa it is said that Prabhāsa,109 Gaya, Puskara, Varanasi, Prayaga or holy places to the east or west thereof, or to the north are not superior or equal to the Kartika vrata. The Anusasana-parva110 proclaims that there is no higher tapas than upavāsa (fasting) or even equal to it and that poor men can secure the rewards of sacrifices by resorting to the upayāsa described. Hemādri quotes two verses on Arkavrata from the Bhavisyapurāṇa stating that if a man observes for a year nakta on the 6th and 7th tithis in each fort night he obtains the merit secured by those who perform the Vedic sacrifices called sattras or who observe the vow of speaking the truth. 

In the Varahapurana the question111 asked is 'how can a poor man reach God' and the reply is that he can do so by vratas ___108. श्रुतास्ते मानवा धर्मा वैदिकाश्च श्रुता मया। कलौ युगे न शक्यन्ते ते वै कर्तु मराधिप॥ सुखोपायमल्पधनमल्पक्लेशं महाफलम्। पुराणानां च सर्वेषां सारभूतं वदामि ते॥ एकादश्यां न भुञ्जीत पक्षयोरुभयोरपि । ... एकादश्यां न भुञ्जन्ति न ते यान्ति यमालयम् । पद्म IV. 53. 4 f; these are quoted from महाभारत by हेमाद्रि (वत I. p. 1089). ___109. प्रभासं नाधिक पार्थ न गया न च पुष्करम्। वाराणसी न वा तद्वत् प्रयागमधवापि च। तीर्थानि च ततः पूर्व पश्चिमानि जनेश्वर । सर्वाण्येव नृपश्रेष्ठ उदीचीदिग्भवानि च। म समानि महाबाहो वतान्ते कार्तिकस्य च । हे.

The irst verse is quoted by हेमाद्रि (व्रत) I. p. 317 from the महाभारत and the 2nd from Padmapurana.

and fasts. The Lingapurāṇa (pūrvārdha 83. 4) provides that one who for a year observes nakta (eating only once in the evening) and worship of Siva on the 14th and 8th tithis in each pakṣa (fortnight) secures the reward of all sacrifices and reaches the highest goal. The Bhavisya asserts that brāhmanas who have no sacred fires (śrauta or smārta) benefit in this way that gods become pleased with them by (the observance of) vratas, fasts, restrictive rules of conduct and various kinds of gifts, particularly by a fast on special tithis. 

The keynote struck by the Matsya, Brahma and other Purāṇas is how to secure great rewards with little effort. The Brahma-purāṇa remarks that by merely taking in Kaliyuga the name of Kesava a man obtains the same rewards that one got in kota-yuga by deep meditation, in Tretā by performing sacrifices and in Dvāpara by worship (of images). The Matsya says: The great sages do not commend sacrifices which involve killing (of animals); those whose wealth is tapas became firmly placed in heaven by making gifts, according to their means, of particles of grains (collected from fields &c.), roots, fruits, vegetables and water vessels and that tapas is superior for several) reasons to sacrifices. The Padmapurāṇa reaches the peak of exaggeration when it says 'no one except Hari will be able to recount the merit of him who offers a lamp on the day of Hari in Kārtika with devotion' or 'Visṇuvrata is the highest, a hundred solemn Vedic sacrifices are not equal to it'. The Skandapurāṇa112 (quoted by Hemādri on vrata vol. I. pp. 318-321 ) contains a long eulogy of vrata, one verse of which may be cited here 'Gods attained their position through restrictive observances (vratas); they shine forth as stars by virtue of the vratas ( they performed)'. 

There were certain differences between Vedic sacrifices and vratas. The promised reward of most sacrifices was heaven, while Purāṇas promised that most vratas would confer tangible benefits in this very life. Further, vratas could be performed by: all, including sūdras, maidens, married women, widows, even prostitutes. 

There were vratas for the brahmaçõrin (called Veda-vratas ) and for the spātaka. These have been already dealt with in H. of Dh. vol. II, pp. 370-374 and pp. 412-415 respectively. That

vratas (in the medieval sense ) existed even in the first centuries before and after the Christian era follows from the Ap. Dh. S. and from the dramas of Kālidāsa, from the Mrcchakatika and the Ratnāyali. The Ap. Dh. S. II. 8. 18 prescribes a vrata for one year which is equal. in its merit to brahmacārivrata for 48 years and Ap. Dh. S. II. 8. 18-19 to Ap. Dh. S. II. 8. 20 prescribe two modes of a vrata to be begun on Tisya (Pusya) naksatra to be observed by a person desirous of prosperity. Vide S. B. E. vol. II, pp. 145– 148. Hemādri (vrata II. .p. 628 quotes Āp. Dh. S. II. 8. 20.3-9), explains the sutras and calls this Āpastambokta Pusyavrata. 

In the Sākuntala (Act. II) the dowager queen (mother of Duṣyanta) sends a message that on the 4th day from the date of the message her fast (vrata) would end 113 The Vikramoryasiya (III) appears to refer to a vrata called in later times Rohiṇi. candrasayana-vrata (vide Hemādri vol. II. pp. 599-600 ). It may be noted that in the above works royal ladies are described as observing vratas. In the Raghuvamsa Kalidāsa alludes to an Āsidhāra-vrata (XIII. 67). The Mrcchakatika (Act I) speaks of an upavāsa (a vrata) called Abhirupapati which appears to bave been somewhat like the Bhartrprāptivrata described by Hemādri (vol. I. pp. 1199-1200). The Ratnāvali ( Act I at ond) describes Madanamahotsava which reminds us of the same described in Hemādri (vol. II, pp. 21-24). It appears, however, that the number of vratas in the first centuries of the Christian era was not very large. Gradually, however, the number of vratas increased by leaps and bounds and their total number, as seen from the list furnished at the end of this section, would be in the region of one thousand. One of the earliest digests on tithis and astrological matters in relation to Dharmaśāstra is the Rājamārtanda of king Bhoja (1st half of 11th century A. D.). It mentions only a few vratas (about 24). The next important extant work is the Kștyakalpataru of Laksmidhara (1st half of 12th century A. D.) who mentions in the vratakāṇda about 175. A comparatively later work viz. the Vratakālaviveka of Śūlapāṇi (1375–1430 A. D.), which discusses the rules about the proper times for observing vratas, mentions only 11 vratas. Hemādri's is the largest published work on vratas, containing as it does

Works on vratas 

about 2200 printed pages in the B. I. edition. It deals with about 700 vratas. This shows that towards the end of the thirteenth century, when foreign invaders had seized the larger part of India and were ruthlessly razing temples to the ground and converting by force and fraud thousands to their faith, the men of the day, both learned and ignorant, were expending vast intellectual labour and huge sums of money on vratas, pilgrimages and śrāddhas, blissfully ignorant of and blind to the political and religious dangers that engulfed them all. 

The vratakośa edited by M. M. Gopinath Kaviraja (in the Sarasvatibhavana series in 1929 ) lists 1622 vratas, but that list is unduly swollen and inflated for various reasons.114 For example, the Astakā-śrāddhas and Anvastaka-śrāddhas are included and have nine numbers assigned to them. There are twelve numbers assigned to Anantavrata because it is performed for twelve months from Mārgaśīrṣa, but Hemādri (on vrata vol. II. pp. 667-671 ) treats it as one vrata. Upavāsavrata is given four numbers, the only reference given being Hemādri (vrata) II. p. 509 (only 11 lines from Matsya). Hemādri (vrata II. pp. 748-52, 757 and so on) describes E kabhakta twelve times in each month from Caitra to Phālguna and then on II. p. 863 refers to him who performs Ekabhaktavrata for one year. The Vratakosa gives 13 separate numbers (2 for Ekabhakta and 11 for Eka bhukta, for this latter form there being no authority of Hemādri who calls all the 13 Ekabhaktavrata). Grahaśānti is given five numbers. It is unnecessary to multiply examples. If properly sifted the number would be much smaller than 1000. 

When a person undertakes a vrata he must see to it that he finishes it; for dire consequences are laid down for him who gives it up through heedlessness. Chāgaleya declares115 'when

a person, having first undertaken a vrata, does not carry it out, being led away by some desire, he while alive becomes (i. e. is to be treated as) a cāndāla and after death becomes a dog'. In such a case where through greed, infatuation or inadvertence a man is guilty of breaking his vrata, he has to undergo three days' fast and also shave his head and then begin the vrata (the remainder acc. to Nirnayasindhu, the whole of it acc. to Sula pāṇi). The Varāhapurāṇa states that man who undertakes a vrata on ekadasi day but does not, owing to foolishness, finish it, reaches a very evil state'. 

Death in the midst of a vrata did not deprive the performer of the merit for which he began it. Angiras 116 provides 'if a. person that has begun some religious act for some benefit dies before the rite is finished, he secures the merit that is the reward ( of that act) after his death; Manu so declared'. 

No one should undertake a vrata in the midst of aśauca (impurity on birth and death ). But it is provided by the Visnudharmasutra117 (22.49) that asauca does not affect the king in doing his royal duties, nor those undergoing a vrata in the carrying out of the vrata. Similarly, Laghu-Visnu observes: in the case of vratas, sacrifices, marriages, in śrāddha, homa, worship (of an image ), in japa, impurity does not affect after they are begun, but it affects before they are begun ( i. e. is an obstacle to beginning these after impurity). Yaj. III. 28-29 are similar verses. It is laid down in the śāstras 118 that danger ( to the

Matters not affecting vratas 

observer of vrata ) from all beings, disease, forgetfulness, the command of one's guru do not break a vrata provided these occur only once ( during the period of the particular vrata ). It is provided by the Matsya-purana, Agni and Satyavrata119 that in the case of women that have commenced a vrata of long duration there is no stoppage of the vrata if they have monthly illness in the midst of the vrata or they become pregnant or are delivered of a child and that they should get the rites performed by another as long as they are impure, but physical acts (such as fasting ) may be done by them. There are certain other matters that do not affect the observance of a vrata, viz. (drinking ) 120 water, (partaking of ) roots, fruits and milk and sacrificial offering, the desire ( or command) of a brahmana, the order of one's guru and medicine. Hemādri remarks that the drinking of milk and the rest that follow do not affect vrata if the performer is a woman, a child or one who is in extreme pain. A person observing vrata 121 should eschew all this, viz. anointing the body or the head with oil, chewing tāmbūla, applying sandalwood paste and whatever else would increase physical strength or passion. 

What actions do not detract from the observance of upavāsa will be discussed later. 

A few words about homa may be said here. Women could not offer homa with mantras (Manu IX. 18). Homa could be performed for them through a priest. When no particular substance is specified the āhuti (offering ) into fire is to be of

clarified butter ( Karmapradipa of Gobhila I. 113).122 The number of āhutis may be 108, 28 or 8 or as many as are expressly specified. The Samayapradipa ( folio 4 b) has a long discussion about the fire in which homa is to be made. One who is an āhitāgni (who has established the sacred Vedic fires) should employ the fire established by him when he was married, as laid down by Yāj. (1.97). According to some, the rule of Yāj. applies only to grhya rites that are laid down in the Grhyasūtras and that oven an āhitāgni should employ ordinary fire for his vratas. One who has no smārta fire should also perform vrata homas in ordinary fire by himself or through a priest.
