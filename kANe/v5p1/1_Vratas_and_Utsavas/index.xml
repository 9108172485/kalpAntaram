      <description>SECTION 1 VRATAS (Religious Vows) and UTSAVAS (Religious Festivals)
CHAPTER I VRATA IN THE RGVEDA
Vrata is one of many Sanskrit words, the use and history of which extend over several thousand years. The derivation and semantic development of the word vrata have been the subject of great controversies. These questions have been dealt with by me at some length in the JBBRAS, vol. 29 (1954) pp. 1-28. I shall here summarise the discussion contained therein.</description>

VRATA in Vedic Literature, Sūtras and Smr̥tis ;
definition and importance of Vratas.
After dealing with the etymology and semantic development of the word &amp;lsquo;vrata&amp;rsquo; from the passages of the Rgveda in which the word occurs, it is now time to tarn to the other Vedic Samhitās and the Brāhmaṇas for finding out how that word is dealt with in them. Some of the Rgvedic verses occur in other Vedic Samhitās.</description>

Persons entitled to engage in Vratas, objects desired by means of Vratas, classifications of Vratas and literature on Vratas, times for Vratas
One important matter is that of vratādhikāriṇaḥ (persons entitled to engage in a vrata). Persons of all castes including śūdras are entitled to perform vratas. Devala states: 123 there is no doubt that (men of) all varṇas are released from sins by observing vratas, fasts and restrictive rules of behaviour and by mortification (lit.</description>

Individual vratas; Caitra Pratipad, Ramanavami,
Aksayya-trtiya, Parasuramajayanti, Dasahara,
Savitri-vrata.
The Mahabharata 205 prescribes how to set about a vrata. &amp;ldquo;Taking in one&amp;rsquo;s hand a copper vessel full of water and turning one&amp;rsquo;s face to the north one should undertake the upavāsa, or whatever else he resolves in his mind to undertake as a vrata.&#39; Devala 206 also says &amp;lsquo;without taking food (the previous night), after taking a bath and having performed ūcamana (ceremonial sipping of water) and after having declared before the Sun and other devatās (his intent) a person should perform a vrata&amp;rsquo;.</description>

11
The most important tithi in the month of Āṣāḍha is Ekādaśī. A voluminous literature has grown round Ekādaśī in the Purāṇas and medieval digests. There are separate treatises on Ekādaśī written by medieval writers, such as the Ekādaśī viveka of Sūlapāni and the Ekādasītattva of Raghunandana: Besides, such medieval digests as Kālaviveka (pp. 425-451), Hemādri on Kāla pp. 145–288, Kālanirṇaya of Mādhava (pp. 233–275), Vratarāja pp. 361-475, Kāla-tattvaviyecana (pp.</description>

On Āṣāḍha-sukla ekādaśī or dyādaśī or paurnimā 317 or on the day when the Sun enters the Zodiacal sign Cancer, cāturmāsya vrata is to be observed. Whenever it may be begun it is to be finished on Kārtika-sukla 12. The performer should observe a a fast that day, worship Viṣṇu (image) and pray as follows: (Garuḍapurāṇa I. 121. 2–3) &amp;lsquo;O God! I have undertaken this vrata in your presence; may it succeed without obstacles if you become favourable to me; after I undertake this vrata if I die when it is half-finished, may it become completely fulfilled through your favour&amp;rsquo;!</description>

      <description>CHAPTER VII
Vratas called Nāgapañcami, Manasāpūjā,
Raksābandhana, Krsnajanmāṣtami
In the month of Srāvana there are several important vratas, one of which is Nāgapañcami on the 5th of the bright half of Śrāvana. The Nāgapañcami is observed in different ways in all parts of India. Some hold that, instead of Aksayyatrtiyā, Nāgapañcami is the one half auspicious day out of 3} most auspicious days in the year. The Bhaviṣyapurāpa, Brāhma parva (chapter 32 verses 1-39), expatiates on Nāgapañcami.</description>

Rsipañcami, Anantacaturdaśī.
On the 3rd tithi of the bright half of Bhadrapada occurs the Haritālikāvrata for women alone. This vrata is not found in the Kr̥tyakalpataru on vrata or in Hemādri. It is described only in the later medieval digests like the Nirṇayasindhu (p. 133), Vratārka (folios 44 6-49 b), Vratarāja (pp. 103-110) and Abalyākāmadhenu (folios 282-295). It may, however, be noted that the Rājamārtaṇḍa of Bhoja (first half of 11th century A.</description>

Navaratra or Durgotsava
From the 1st of Āśvina bright half to the 9th is celebrated the Durgāpājā festival, otherwise called Navarātra, observed all over India in some form or other. Some of the works 390 provide that Durgotsava must be celebrated in both Sarad (Āśvina-śukla) and Vasanta (in Caitra-śukla). But it is the Durgotsava39 of Āśvina that is celebrated in a grand style, particularly in Bengal, Bihar and Kāmarūpa.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER X
Vijayādaśamī and Divali
The 10th tithi of Asvina-sukla is called Vijayā-daśaml. It is elaborately described in Hemādri (on vrata, vol. 1. pp. 970-973), Nirṇayasindhu (pp. 69-70), Purusārtha-cintāmapi (pp. 145-148), Vratarāja (pp. 359-361) and Kālatattva-vivecana (pp. 309-312), Dharmasindhu (p. 96). As Dasami (10th tithi) is not mentioned in the Yugmarākya the Kālanirṇaya relies on a verse that in the bright half that tithi which exists at sunrise should be accepted for performance of rites and in the dark half the one that exists at sunset.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER XI
Makarasankrānti and Mahaśivarātri
Makara-Saṅkrānti. This is a very important religious observance and festival. About 70 years ago (in the author&amp;rsquo;s boyhood) it occurred on the 12th or 13th January according to the several Indian almanacs then cuğrent, but now it falls, owing to the procession of the equinoxes, on the 13th or the 14th of January in the month of Pausa. Saṅkranti means the (apparent) passage of the sun from one rāśi (sign of the Zodiac) to the next following&#39; and hence the rāśi in which the Sun enters is designated as the Saṅkranti of that name.</description>

Holikā and Grahaṇa (eclipse)
Holika. Holi or Holikā is a festival of unmixed gaiety and frolics throughout India, though all parts do not observe it in the same way. One element, viz. bonfire, is present almost everywhere except in Bengal. Swinging of Krsna image on Phālguna Full Moon is done in Bengal, but it is not observed in several other parts of India. The number of days during which this festival is observed also varies from province to province.</description>
