SECTION 1 VRATAS (Religious Vows) and UTSAVAS (Religious Festivals) 

CHAPTER I VRATA IN THE RGVEDA 

Vrata is one of many Sanskrit words, the use and history of which extend over several thousand years. The derivation and semantic development of the word vrata have been the subject of great controversies. These questions have been dealt with by me at some length in the JBBRAS, vol. 29 (1954) pp. 1-28. I shall here summarise the discussion contained therein. 

In the great St. Petersburg Dictionary the word vrata is derived from the root vṛ' (to choose) and the important senses of the word given in that Dictionary are: (1) will, command, law, prescribed order; (2) subservience, obedience, service; (3) domain; (4) order, regulated succession, realm; (5) calling, office, custom ary activity, carrying on, custom; (6) religious duty, worship, obligation; (7) any undertaking, religious or ascetic performance or observance, Vow, sacred work; (8) vow in general, fixed purpose; (9) other specialized senses. Max Muller derived it from vr 'to protect' and held that it meant originally what is enclosed, protected, set apart, then what is settled or determined, law, ordinance and then 'sway or power'. Whitney, in a note on this word in the Proceedings published in J. A. O. S. vol. XI pp. 29-31, after setting out the treatment of the word in the St. Petersburg Dictionary, brushed aside Max Mullor's etymology as unsatisfactory and as possessing little plausibility and declared that he did not accept the derivation of the word from vr 'to choose', that 'vr' did not signify willing or command, but only choice or preference, though he admitted that there is a relation ship between 'choose' and 'command'. He objected that'ta' 23 an affix (except in the formation of past passive participles) was very rare and that the only analogous word he could think of would be 'marta' from ‘mp' to die. He preferred to derive the word from 'vrt' 'to proceed' and, though he admitted that the form vrata from 'yit' with affix a would be exceptional, he thought that the words 'vraja' and 'trada' supported the deriva tion and put forward the ground that the word 'vrata' occurs 





frequently in the Rgveda with verbs of motion such as 'car', *sa$c' or 'sac'. 

Prof. V. M. Apte contributed a long article on vrata to the 3rd volume of the Bulletin of the Deccan College Research Institute at Poona (pp. 407-488). Prof. Apte agreed with Whitney in deriving the word vrata from yt', boldly asserted that the derivation of the word from 'vr' to choose or 'vr' to guard or enclose is impossible (p. 410), that there is not a single vrata passage in the Rgveda which favours the meaning 'will, command, obedience or fixed purpose', that 'vṛt' not only means 'to proceed' (as Whitney holds) but also 'to turn, to turn oneself, turn round, revolve, move on' and that therefore 'vrata' means not only procedure, course of action, conduct, but also 'circular movement and then 'route or circular path' (pp. 411-412). 

My own view is that both Whitney and Prof. Apte are wrong in deriving the word vrata from 'vrt'. I further hold that passages in which 'vst' occurs with upasargas such as abhi, ā, ni, pari, pra or vi, would not be helpful in determining the original meaning of 'vrt' by itself, since upasargas often totally change the meaning of the root", that it is doubtful whether the root'vit' standing by itself means in the Rgveda 'to proceed' (as Whitney thought) and I deny that 'yṛt' occurring by itself without upasargas in the Rgveda ever means 'to turn round, move on' (as Prof. Apte asserts). In my opinion the root 'yst' by itself (and not used in a causal or frequentative sense) means simply to be, to remain, to abide' Occurrences of the root vrt' without any upasarga before or after it are few in the Rgveda. Some typical examples may be given. "When, O Indra, thou didst strike down the wiles of Svarbhānu (the demon Rāhu) that remained below the sky2' (Rg. V. 40.6); "the wheel does not affect (jolt) your chariot (O Aśvins!) that is followed by songs one after another and that remains possessed of food' (Rg. VIII. 5. 34); "they (the dice) remain downwards (lie down on the board or ground) but they throb or strike above (i. e. they shake or terrify the hearts of gamblers ); though they have no hands yet they defeat those that are endowed with hands' (Rg. X. 34. 9). Vide also Rg. X. 27.19, X. 107. 11 for other verses where 'vrt'

Meaning of Vrata 

occurs without an upasarga and means 'to remain or abide'. Even with an upasarga like 'sam' vrt means simply 'to be or to abide' and not 'revolve or turn' or 'move on'. Vide Rg. VI. 41.2, X. 90. 14, X. 121. 1 and 7, X. 129.4, in which 'sam-vartatām' or 'samavartata' simply means 'let it remain' or 'it was or existed'. Simply because 'vrt' with "abhi' means 'to turn towards or attack' (as in Rg. IV. 43.5 or V.31.5) or with 'ni' means 'come down or return' (as in Rg. X. 19. 1, 3, 5, X. 95.17) or with 'pari' means 'roam over or round' (as in Rg. I. 164. 11 and IV. 36.1), or with pra' means 'to proceed'(as in Rg. V. 30.8 or X. 89.12 ), or with vi means 'roll or revolve' (as in Rg. I. 185. 1, V. 30. 8, V. 53.7, VI. 9.1) it does not at all follow that the original sense of vrt' is, as Prof. Apte asserts (p. 411 end), 'to revolve or roll on'. Besides, the last two senses are somewhat contradictory. 

Prof. Apte complains that scholars were content as to vrata with the meanings 'law, statute, command, sacrifice, vow, fixed purpose, duty' and did not take enough notice of the important part that the sense of 'route or circular path' plays in the Rgveda. Ho opines that the divine vratas often mentioned in the Rgveda rather mean 'the heavenly routes, the divine rounds, the periodi cal movements round the sky closely adhered to by the gods themselves' rather than 'holy laws' laid down by a particular deity. Adopting a suggestion of Tilak in 'Orion' (p. 154) that the path of sta sometimes mentioned in the Rgveda is the broad belt of the Zodiac which the luminaries never transgress, Prof. Apte sets out to prove that the word 'sta' in the Rgveda primarily means the belt of the Zodiac (vide his paper in the Silver Jubilee volume of the Annals of the B. O. R. I, pp. 55-56). This theory has failed to appeal to eminent Vedic scholars. In my humble way I endeavoured to show in the 4th vol. of the H. of Dh. (pp.2-5) that 'sta' has three senses in the Rgveda, one of which is the course of nature or the regular general order in the cosmos'. 'The path by which the group of Adityas reaches sta' in Rg. 1. 41. 43 or the statement in Rg. 1. 164. 11 'the wheel of sta, that has twelve spokes (12 constellations or months), continually goes round the sky without being worn out' are only illustrations of the first meaning of rta. But this meaning of sta by itself shods hardly any light on the meaning of vrata. Rta and vrata are 

Thi \#. I. 41. 4; Erasin 

PU 

3. Ev: Tout En Cyth para un uraka i *. I. 164. 11. 





not synonyms and it is difficult to see how, conceding for argu ment that 'sta' is the belt of the Zodiac, vrata means, as Prof. Apte obviously thinks, the same thing. Ṛta is an Indo-European word but so far as I know 'vrata' is not even shown to be Indo Iranian, much less Indo-European. 

Prof. Apte advances the theory that there are two parallel phases of the semantic evolution of the word 'vrata' viz. a 'divine phase' and a 'human' phase. I feel no hesitation in denying the existence of any such distinction in the meaning of the word 'vrata'. Prof. Apte arranges (pp. 414-415) the so-called divine phase of the meaning of vrata into six groups, viz. (1) turning round, passage, procedure, physical activity, (II) circular path, settled or beaten route, (III) sphere or region of movement or influence, (IV) routine, laws of movement; periodic appearance or visit, customary activity, recurring march, (V) victorious advance or strength, (VI) ordinance, law, rule or code of conduct. In the so-called 'human phase of semantic development he sets out four groups of senses, viz. (1) physical activity (as disting uished from mental), duty, profession; (II) the sum total of those peculiar ethical and religious duties and practices which made up the culture pattern of the Aryans; (III) the specific social and religious duties of the three classes of Aryan society ; (IV) devo tion to duty in general on the part of men and women. 

I have summarised Prof. Apte's long list of meanings in ten groups. The very fact that Prof. Apte had to marshall over sixty English equivalents for the meaning of the word 'vrata', which occurs in the Rgveda only about 220 times by itself or in com bination with other words is enough to make scholars suspicious about the correctness of the entire scheme. Though he had the hardihood to assert in one place (p. 410)4 that no passage in the Rgveda favours the meaning 'will or command he admits (on pp. 476-477) that in three passages (Rg. II. 38.7, X. 10.5, X. 33.9) the meaning of vrata as 'ordinances laid down by a divinity for devotees or human beings' is quite acceptable to him and further that in about 25 passages (which come under groups II to IV of the so-called human phase of Prof. Apte) vrata either means 'ethical or religious code of practices of the three classes of Aryans' or 'beneficent sway or devotion'. 

4. Hereafter up to aote 23 wherever only pages are mentioned and Do work, the reference is to the pages of the 3rd vol. of the Bulletin of the Deccan College Research Institute,Derivation of Vrata 

I shall now state my own views on the derivation and the meanings of the word vrata in the Rgveda. I derive the word from the root 'vr' (to choose). From this root comes the word 'vara' (bridegroom who is chosen from among several men by a maiden or her guardian), which occurs in æg. IX. 101. 14 and 

X. 85. 8 and 9. Choosing involves willing or volition on the part of the person choosing. Hence 'vr' also means 'to will'. Therefore, when the word vrata is derived from 'vr' with the suffix 'ta', the meaning of vrata can be 'what is willed' or simply 'will. The will of a person in power or authority is a command or law unto others. Devotees believe that gods have laid down certain commands to be followed by themselves as well as by all beings. Thus comes the sense of 'law or ordinance'. A command of a superior imposes and implies a corresponding duty to obey. When commands are obeyed or duties are performed in the same way for long, they become the patterns of obligations i. e. cus toms or practices. When persons believe or feel that they must perform certain acts as ordained by gods, then arises the sense of religious worship or duty. If a man imposes upon himself certain restrictions as to his behaviour or food to win the favour of gods that becomes a sacred vow or religious observance. Thus the several meanings of the word 'vrata', which I derive from the root'vr', are command or law, obedience or duty, religious or moral practices, religious worship or observance, sacred or solemn Vow or undertaking, then any vow or pattern of conduct. It should not be supposed that these several meanings followed one another in a time sequence. Two or more meanings might have been simultaneously in vogue such as 'ordinance, duty or obedience'. These meanings of vrata set out by me are quite sufficient for the interpretation of almost all Rgveda passages in which the word occurs. 

When Whitney derived the word 'vrata' from 'vrt' with affix 'a', he could cite only two words 'vraja' and 'trada' as parallel. But it is quite possible to argue that ‘vraja' is not analogous to vrata (if derived from 'vṛt). Vraja (cowpen) occurs in the Rgveda in II. 38. 8, IV. 1. 15, IV. 16. 6, V. 6. 7, V. 33. 10, can vory well be derived from 'vraj' to go and Pāpini III. 3. 119 appears to derives it from 'vraj' in the sense of 'karaṇa' or adhikarama. The root 'vraj' occurs in the Rgveda. If vraja is derived from

6. S MT THAT: graf of fragm. IIJ. 56. 4. 





the root 'vraj, it is not on all fours with vrata derived from 'vrt'. Whitney probably derived 'vraja' from 'vrj. But the meaning of 'vraja' (cowpen) can hardly arise from the root ‘vȚj' (to give up, abandon). The word 'trada' occurs only once in the Rgveda (VIII. 45. 28)) and is applied to Indra. It is difficult to say from what root, if any, it is derived. Whitney probably derived it from 'trd' to injure or pierce. The word 'trdilāḥ' (crushing) is applied to the stones (grāvāpaḥ) which crush soma stalks (Rg. X. 94. 11). Whitney says he knows only one word 'marta' derived from 'mr' (to die) with the affix 'ta' which is analogous to vrata if the latter be derived from 'vr'. But Whitney failed to notice other words with the affix 'ta' (not past passive partici ples) such as ‘karta' (deep hole, cavern) (in Rg. 1. 121.13, II. 29.6, IX. 73. 8 and 9) and 'garta' (cavity or seat in a war chariot) (in Rg. II. 33. 11, V. 62. 5 and 8, VI. 20. 9, VII. 64. 4), vāta (wind) from 'vā' (Rg. V. 31. 10, X. 168.1 &c.), dhūrta and several others. 

Prof. Apte cites the word vartani (which means 'way' in Rg. I. 23. 9, V. 61. 9, VII. 8. 16, VIII. 23. 19, VIII. 63. 8) as analog ous to vrata (from vrt). But that word lends very little help. In 'vartani' there is guṇa (vrt becomes vart); besides vartani cannot be derived from ‘vrt' meaning turn round or revolve' (which Prof. Apte gives as the original meaning), but from the meaning 'to abide' or at the most 'to proceed' and further 'vartani' has practically only one meaning in the Rgveda, while vrata has to be paraphrased by sixty different words in English by Prof. Apte. 

Prof. Apte following Whitney relies on the fact (p. 409) that vrata is frequently employed in the Rgveda with verbs of motion such as anu-i, anu-car, anu-gā, anu-vrt. But these roots take on another meaning (viz. 'to follow or observe') owing to the presence of 'anu' and in almost all the passages where the forms of these roots with anu occur there is no indication whatever of physical motion, but only that of 'obeying or observing'. Besides, the root car' itself is not used in the sense of physical motion in several passages of the Rgveda, but in the sense of performing' and

Meaning of Vrata 

'observing'. Video Rg. I. 52. 6, III. 54. 2, VI 9.6, VII. 89.5. Moreover, in words like brahmacāri (Rg. X. 109.5) and vratacārinah (Rg. VII. 103. 1) the meaning of a physical motion, if it was the original one at all, is totally absent and the mean ing 'performing' or 'observing' is the only one possible. Some occurrences of the roots 'saśc' and 'sac' in which the meaning of physical motion is inapplicable but the meaning 'resort to, accept or be united to appears to be intended are found in Rg. II. 1. 13, VII, 28.4 (for forms of 'saśc') and IV. 12. %., VII. 85.5, VIII, 4. 9, IX, 95.4 (for forms of 'sac'). 

It is now necessary to examine the contention of Prof. Apte that vrata means in the Rgveda the tracks or routes that the various luminaries trace in the heavens. Vratas are spoken of not only in relation to Agni, Indra, Mitra, Soma, Uṣas, Savit; and Adityas but also in relation to Varupa (in Rg. I. 25.1, III. 54. 18, V. 69.4, VII. 83.9), Brhaspati (in II. 23. 6), Indra and Brahmapaspati (II. 24. 12), Aditi (I. 144. 12, VII. 87.9), Parjanya (V.83.5) and Aśvins (I. 183.3). Conceding for a moment that by some stretch of imagination or some linguistic acrobatics one can speak of the vratas of Agni, Adityas, Mitra, Indra, Savit; and Uṣas as referring to the tracks of luminaries in the heavens, the mid regions and on the earth, one should like to know whether Aditi, Asvins, Varupa, Bșhaspati or Brahmapaspati aro luminaries and what tracks they were supposed to trace in the heavens or elsewhere. Scholars are not agreed as to the meaning of Aditi or as to the physical or celestial phenomena Varuṇa or the Aśvins were supposed to represent. Aditi is a riddle, being identified with the heaven and the mid regions and also spoken of as the father, mother or the son or as the mother of Daksa and also his daughter ; vide Rg. 1. 89. 10, 11. 27.1, X. 72. 4-5 and Nirukta XI. 23 as to Aditi and Rg. II. 1. 11 where Agni is identified with Aditi. Long before the times of the Nirukta there was difference on the question of the nature of Asvins, some identifying them with Heaven and Earth, or day and night, or the Sun and the Moon or two meritorious kings (Nirukta XII. 1), while some Western scholars hold them to be the Morning and the Evening star or Castor and Pollux. The endeavour of interpreters of the Rgveda should be to assiga such 

9. Tim ma fara prantset To GMH4C*. I. 52.6; te rad sraigierea TH \# wa sitt! *. III. 54, 2; PÅ TU Franti: Ferra PE afara, *. VI, 9. 6. 





a derivation and meaning to the word vrata as would be appro priate in all cases where the word vrata is brought in relation to some gods. In my opinion the only meanings that can be well construed with all passages in which the vratas of the several gods mentioned above are referred to is 'commands or ordin ances, religious or moral practices or worship or vows. One does not understand what Prof. Apte means when he remarks at (p. 442) in a tone of ridicule that observing or obeying the 'ordin ances or religious worship of gods' is a soft job and looking after the paths or the tracks of luminaries is a strenuous one. If anything, the reverse of this should be true. 

The word 'samrāj' appears to be applied to a human king in Rg.10 VII. 58. 4 'the sovereign, protected by you, O Maruts! kills the enemy', and in Rg. X. 85.46 the newly married girl has the blessing 'be you a queen' (samrājñī). Varuṇa, Mitra, Indra, Agni, Viśve-devāḥ and Adityas are called kings (rājan) and emperors (samrāj) in Rg. II. 41.6, III. 10.1, III. 54. 10, V. 85. 1, VII. 38. 4, VIII. 27. 22, X. 63. 5. Varupa (who is praised in about 12 hymns) is called samrāj oftener than even Indra praised in about 200 hymns. What is more natural than to suppose that the gods called kings and emperors were believed to have laid down commands or ordinances to be obeyed by all. Though Rgvedic sages extol several gods they had already arrived at the conception that there was only one Supreme Being that was addressed under different names such as Indra, Mitra, Varuna, Agni and assumed several forms (Rg. I, 164. 46, VI. 47. 18, X. 121. 1, X. 129. 1-2). Vratas are spoken of as dhruva (immutably fixed) as in 11. 5. 4, III. 56. 1, V. 69. 4 and as adabdha (unharmed, unassailable) as in 1. 24. 10, 11. 9. 1, 111.54.18, VII. 66. 6 and dailya (divine) as in Rg. 1.70.1, 1. 92. 12, VII.75.3. One must carefully remember these facts when ascertaining the exact meaning of vrata mentioned in connection with almost all the prominent gods of the Rgveda. It is often stated in the Rgveda that the vratas of the god whom the sage for the moment praises are not violated by other gods. Some striking examples11

Meaning of Vrata 

may, be given here : Rg. III. 7. 7 'the gods observe the vratas of gods' (devā devānām-anu hi vratā gub); II. 38. 9 'I invoke for my welfare with salutations god Savits whose vrata is not violated by Indra, Varupa, Mitra, Aryaman, or Rudra or by the (god's) enemies'; III, 56. 1 'the primaval and immutably fixed vratas are not destroyed by the wily (demons), nor by the wise (sages), nor by the well-disposed Heaven and Earth and the firmly fixed mount ains are not there for being bent down'; VIII. 42. 1 'the all-know ing and powerful (Varuṇa) made Heaven firm, he measured (created) the expanse of the earth; the great king sits over (rules) all the worlds; all these are the vratas of Varuna'. Vide also Rg. 1, 101.3, 11. 24. 12, II. 38. 2, III, 30. 4, V. 69. 4. 

The above mentioned passages clearly show that the Vedic sages believed that not only did the several gods observe or carry out the immutably fixed ordinances laid down by themselves or by any one of them but that even wily demons had to observe them and that waters or rivers flow as ordained by gods. We have to take into account along with these beliefs that the Rgveda often adverts to the fact that human beings also break (or violate) the vratas of gods, are liable to be punished therefor and pray to the gods to pity them and to withhold the punishment. For example, 12 Rg. I. 25.1-2 'Whatever ordinance (vrata) of thine, O Varuna! we may break day to day as people (subjects) do (i. e. break the king's law) do not reduce us to death &c.'; X. 25. 3 'O Somal if I transgress your perfect (lit. well-baked) vratas, then in thy exhilaration (at our sacrifices) take pity on us as a father does towards his son'. Vide also VII. 89.5, VIII. 48. 9. 

(Continued from last page) TOUT TAIGI VIII. 42 1; the word vrata occurs five times in II. 38 (verses 2, 3, 6, 7, 9) and should be construed according to the general rules of inter pretation in the same sense in all verses of the same hymn at least. Prof. Apte admits (on p. 476) that the meaning 'ordinances' would be appropriate ja Rg. II. 38, 7 ( 

A TT ara aral F4 HORA ) and accepts that meaning in that verse, but on II. 38. 9 (p. 468) his obsession about the original meaning being 'tracks' leads bim to say "that in that verse the word vrata means 'Savitr's fixed movements in the heavens." ___12. यञ्चिद्धि ते विशो यथा म देव वरुण व्रतं मिनीमास विद्यवि। मा नो बधाय हरनवे ATEISTarfa :1 .

It would have been noticed that in some of the passages quoted above (in note 11) on vrata, verbal forms of the root 'mi' or 'mi' occur. For the correct understanding of these passages the exact meaning of the root 'mi' is very important. The Nighantu (II. 19) includes 'mināti'among verbs meaning ‘vadha' (killing or harming). In the Dhātupātha the meaning of the root ‘mi' is hiṁsā' (killing, annihilating, breaking). Vide Pāṇini VII. 3, 81. (mināter-nigamo). The forms of 'mi' or 'mi' with or without the preposition 'a' or 'pra' occur more than 50 times in the Rgveda and often in connection with vrata. Whitney felt that the occurrences of the forms of 'mi' or 'mi' presented some difficulty about his theory of the derivation of vrata and its meanings, but Prof. Apte, who derived his inspiration from Whitney, feels no such misgivings as Whitney felt, holds, relying on his own interpretation of Rg. I. 124. 3, that 'mi' or 'mi' is a verb of motion and has the primary sense of 'miss, deviate, wander or stray from' (p. 411). Over a dozen verses at least will clearly show that Prof. Apte has been led astray by his preconceived theory about vrata meaning 'tracks of luminaries' and that 'mi' or 'ml' cannot at all be construed in the sense of 'miss' or 'deviate' in the Rgveda. Rg. I. 71. 10 'old age destroys me as (the dark or clouded) sky destroys (distinctness of) forms' (nabho na rūpam jarimā mināti'); I. 124. 213 '(the dawn) which does not violate divine laws but destroys the spans of human life'; I. 179. 1 (Lopāmudrā says to Agastya) old age destroys the beauty of limbs' (mināti sriyam jarimā tanūnām); VII. 84. 4. (Varupa) who is an Aditya, who destroys the false ones and who, the valiant one, imparts immeasurable wealth'. Vide also Rg. 1.92.11, 1. 117.3, III. 32.8, IV. 30.23., V.7.4, V. 82.2 for other examples where forms of 'mi' or 'ml' occur. It is unnecessary to adduce more examples about 'mi'. It is impossible, if Prof. Apte is to be followed, that old age misses or deviates from beauty or that Asvins miss or deviate from the wiles of the demon or that Varuṇa misses falsehood (or false men). Prof. Apte relies (p. 411)

Meaning of Vrata 

on Rg. I. 124. 3.14 as decisively establishing that originally 'mi' was a verb of motion. In the first place, one verse cannot demolish what many verses quoted above convey. Besides, there is nothing in Rg. 1. 124. 3 that establishes what Prof. Apte thinks it does. That verse says 'Here this daughter of heaven wearing a garment of light is seen in the east (by us) simultaneously; she (Dawn) well follows the path of sta (cosmic order), she like (a woman) knowing well does not annihilate the several quarters'. 

The sense of 'command or law' is quite appropriate in more than half the Rgvedic passages in which the word vrata occurs. In some passages the sense of ‘religious practices or modes of sacred worship’ is suitable. For example, Rg. X. 65. 11 says ' (the Viśve-devas) that are good donors make the sun rise in heaven and spread about the Arya vratas over the earth'. Vide also Ṛg. VI, 14, 3. 

There are several places in the Rgveda in which the words 'avrata' (11 times), 'apavrata' (in Rg. 1. 51. 9, V. 42.9, V. 40.6), 'anyavrata' (in V. 20. 2, VIII. 70. 11, X. 22. 8) occur and in almost all of which vrata must be taken to mean 'mode of worship or ethical and religious practices of the Vedic worship pers'. Prof. Apte has to admit this (pp. 479, 483). It will not do to ignore these passages in finding out the derivation and meanings of the word vrata or to clap them in a separate group (as Prof. Apte does on p. 413) and distinguish them from other passages supposed to indicate the divine phase. There is nothing to show that Vedic sages distinguished between divine vratas and other vratas meant to be followed by Heaven and Earth, rivers, mountains and human beings. Some of these passages in which the word 'avrata' occurs strongly militate against the theory of Prof. Apte. For example, 15 in Rg. 1. 101. 2 Indra is 

. 14. एषा दिवो दुहिता प्रत्यदर्शि ज्योतिर्वसाना समना पुरस्तात् । तस्य पन्थामन्वेति 

FIY Hacia afasi hatar \#. I. 124.3. The meaning of the last quarter is that Uṣas always rises in the east and that she does not annihilate the separateness of the four quarters by sometimes risiog in a direction other tban the east. In this the dawn simply follows the law laid down for her in the order of nature (rtasya pantbām). The idea about the confusion of quarters is well expressed in Rg. V. 40. 5. Vide also X, 32 7.

[ Soc. I, Ch. I 

said to have killed Pipru who was avrata and in the very next verse it is said that Varuna and Sūrya abide in the vrata of Indra and the rivers also accept his vrata. Therefore, vrata in this hymn must mean something akin to the meaning of vrata in avrata and not akin to 'tracks of luminaries'. Compare IX, 73.5 and 8 where avrata occurs with 'raksati vratam’in 1X,73.3 (both being verses about Soma). 

There are seven passages in the Rgveda where the word 'vivrata' occurs. In six of them 'vivrata' is applied to the horses of Indra. According to Prof. Apte, the only natural meaning is 'moving or wandering along diverse paths' (p. 419). But this is arguing in a circle. They can be explained if vrata is taken to mean 'ordinance, duty or practice'; when applied to horses 'vivrata' may be held to mean no more than this that two horses are yoked on two sides of the chariot and obey the various orders indicated through the pulling of the reins. The 7th passage X. 55. 3 in which "vivrata' occurs as an adjective of 

jyotih' is difficult to construe and Prof. Apte has not succeeded in satisfactorily explaining it. 

In several passages of the Rgveda phrases like 'tava vrate' Occur. Whitney (p. 409) stated that the phrase should rather mean 'in thy established or approved course, following thy lead or example', than 'under thy control or protection' or 'in thy service' as some scholars hold. Prof. Apte thinks that the translation of 'tava vrate' as 'abiding in thy ordinance' (by Macdonell) misses the point and avers that the proper meaning is dominion, authority, region of sphere'. Some of the passages containing the words 'tava vrate' are Rg. VI. 54. 9, IX. 102.5, X. 36. 13, X. 57. 6. In my opinion 'tava vrate' means 'while we abide by your ordinances'. In X. 36. 13 the first half16 is a relative clause without a verb and we have to supply a form of the root 'as' (to be) or of 'bhū'. In some verses such a form of as' does occur with the words as in Rg. I. 124. 15.17 Therefore wherever the words 'tava vrate' occur, we should generally understand that the meaning is 'while abiding by your ordinances'. This is further supported by the fact that there are passages where the word ‘vrata' and other words

Meaning of Vrata 

like 'sumati' in the locative are used with the forms of the root ‘as' to be or of verbs meaning to abide or dwell. Vide Rg. 1.83.3 ('vrate te kṣeti', 'abides in thy vrata'), II. 27. 13 ('ya ādityānām bhavati pranītau', 'who is within or under the lead of Adityas); X. 14. 6 18 may we be in the good will of them (the pitrs) that deserve to have sacrifices offered to them and also in their beneficent grace'. Vide also Rg. III. 1. 21 and 11I. 59. 4, VI. 47. 13, X. 131.7 (tasya vayam sumatau...syāma). 

There are eight passages in the Rgveda in which the word śucivrata' occurs and is always applied to some god or gods. In three passages VIII, 43. 16, VIII. 44. 21, X. 118. 1 'śucivrata' is an attribute of Agni and Prof. Apte renders it as '(Agni) with a blazing trail, track or sphere' (p. 421). He says 'suci' is derived from suc'(to shine or flame up), that the word 'śuci' can only mean “brilliant or flaming', that the meaning pure' is purely figurative and secondary and is found only in about six or seven out of a total of over a hundred or more in the Rgveda when it is an epithet of' maniṣā, stoma, mati or giraḥ'. These remarks are mis-statements; 'śuci' in the sense of 'pure' is not so rare as Prof. Apte tries to make out (6 or 7 times out of 100). In one Verse alone addressed to the Maruts (Rg. VII. 56. 12) the word19 'suci' occurs six times and should ordinarily be taken only in one sense in those six and can only mean 'pure', since 'śuci' is there applied to offerings (havya) and sacrifice. In VIII. 44. 21 Agni is styled 'sucir-vipraḥ' and 'suciḥ' and 'kavih' The word 'śuci' occurs in that verse four times out of which 'śuci' as applied to 'vipra' and 'kavi' can only mean "pure or holy'. Vide II. 27. 13, where the yajamāna (sacrificer) is called 'suci', I. 142. 9 where the three goddesses Bhārati, Iļā and Sarasvati are said to be 'śuci'. Concoding for argument that the root 'śuc' originally meant to shine or blaze', the distinction of two mean ings (primary and secondary) in 'suci' had disappeared long before the Rgvedic hymns were composed, as Rg. VL. 56. 12 and other verses establish. Vide Rg. III. 62. 5 (where Bșhaspati is called suci), I. 181. 2 (where the horses of the Aśvins are styled *suci'), II. 33. 13 (where the herbs or drugs of Maruts are spoken of as suci), VII. 49.2 and 3 where waters are called 'suci' and

VII. 89, 3 (where Varupa is addressed as "suci'). In the above passages the word śuci in at least a dozen cases is clearly used in the sense of pure', is applied to offerings, sacrifices, drugs, horses, waters or rivers and is not restricted to manīṇā, stoma, mati and giraḥ as Prof. Apte wrongly asserts. Prof. Apte mini mises the number of times that suci' means 'pure', and observes a discreet silence about its being an attribute of the physical objects mentioned above. Therefore, there is no difficulty in holding 'sucivrata' as applied to gods meaning 'whose ordin ances are pure or holy'. In 1. 15. 11 and I. 182. 1 the word 'śucivrata' is an attribute of the Asvins, in III. 62. 17 and VI. 16. 24 of Mitra and Varuna and in VI. 70. 2 of Heaven and Earth. Besides, we have the analogous word 'śucikranda' (the loud laud addressed to whom is pure) applied to Bșhaspati in VII. 97. 5. 

The word 'mahivrata’occurs five times and is applied to Soma (IX. 97.7, IX. 100. 9), to Agni (I. 45. 3, X. 115. 3) and to Varuna (VI. 68. 9) and the word 'mahāmahivrata' to Soma (IX. 48. 2). In all these cases the meaning 'whose commands or laws are great or many' would be quite appropriate. The word 'mahi' by itself occurs in over 110 passages in the Rgveda, in all of which 'mahi' stands for 'mahat' and qualifies words like 'śravas' (food or fame), ksatra ('prowess' as in I. 54. 8 and 11), namaḥ, śarma (in I. 93. 8), dātra ('gift', as in 1. 116. 6), enas (in II. 12. 10), karma (II. 22. 1), Mahitvana (in 11. 23. 4), varūtha, draviṇa (111. 1. 22), raksas (IV. 3. 14). Prof. Apte (p. 475) quite unnecessarily suggests three separate meanings of 'mahivrata', the first of which is of great dominion', 'of great tracks', 'of great exploits' and expands that meaning by interpolating the words 'mighty or resplendent sway or sphere'. 'Mahi’ hardly ever means 'resplendent' by itself. 

The word “priyavrata' occurs only once in the Rgveda (in X. 150. 3), is applied to gods and means 'to whom the ordinances laid down by them are dear'. Prof. Apte (p. 472) criticizes people who explain the word as 'whose laws we love'; but he names no one who does so. Similarly, the word 'puruvrata' occurs once only in Rg. IX. 3. 10, is applied to Soma and means 'whose ordinances are many'. Both these words do not at all help Prof. Apte in his interpretation and are rather against his pet theory (of tracks of luminaries &c.). 

The word 'dhunivrata' occurs twice (in Rg. V.58.2 and V. 87.1) and is applied to Marut or the band of Maruts. Prof. Apte (p. 435Meaning of Vrata 

section 47) takes 'dhuni' as an adjective, and as meaning 'roar ing, storming' and translates ' dhunivrata' as 'whose paths are characterised by roaring or raging' The word 'dhuni' occurs about ten times in the Rgveda and when an adjective means 'one that shakes his enemies or clouds' or is a noun meaning 'river (as in II. 15. 5). Dhuni is also the name of a demon (in Rg. VI. 18. 8, VII. 19. 4, X. 113. 9). In I. 174. 9, V. 34. 5 and 8, VI. 20.12 'dhuni' is an attribute of Indra and in I. 79. 1 of Agni. The Nirukta (V. 12) while explaining Rg. X, 89. 5 (in which both Soma and Indra are praised) explains 'dhuni' as derived from 

dhū’ to shake. Therefore 'dhunivrata' should mean whose ordinances are such as make others (breakers) tremble'. 

It is not necessary to examine separately each of the verses in which the word 'vrata' occurs and Prof. Apte's interpretations thereof. The preceding discussion is sufficient to show what vrata means in almost all passages in the Rgveda. In his zeal to buttress up his theory, Prof. Apte commits mistakes in the construction and translation of some verses. On p. 420 (section 29) he renders Rg. VIII, 94. 2 20 as 'she (Prśni) in whose lap all the gods maintain their vratas, the Sun and the Moon also, in order that they may be seen', explains that the Sun and the Moon are seen only when they keep their pratas and concludes that vratas must mean tracks followed by the Sun. Prof. Apte takes 'gūryāmāsā' as the subject of 'Dharayanto' along with Viśve-devāḥ', but *Sūryāmāsā' is in the objective case in relation to 'drse', the proper translation being in the lap of whom (i. e. of Pęśni, the mother of Maruts), all the gods uphold their laws in order that (people) may see the Sun and the Moon'. What is meant is that the Sun and the Moon rise at the proper times because the gods uphold their ordinances. If we compare VIII. 94.2 with I. 23.21 (=X.9.7), 1. 50.1, 1.52.8, X. 57.4, X. 60.5 it would be clear that my translation is the only correct one and if that be so no question of 'tracks of light' will arise. 

Misinterpretations of words like 'kṣitīḥ' in III. 3. 9 eus meaning dwellings (rather it means “the common mass of people" as in III. 14, 4, VI. 65. 1, VII. 65. 2, VII. 75. 4, VII. 79.1

&c.) and of śruṣtim'on p. 450) are passed over here. On VI. 70.5 Prof. Apte remarks (p. 420, Sec. 17) that to take 'vrata' in 'madhuvrata' applied to the deities Heaven and Earth as mean ing ‘law, duty or will’ is almost absurd. One fails to see why it would be absurd to hold, when heaven and earth are spoken of as 'dropping21 madhu' (madhuścutā) and 'yielding madhu' (madhudughe), that the Vedic poet thinks that the laws of Heaven and Earth as deities are sweet (and not harsh). 

We have next to turn to the word 'dhrtavrata'which occurs eighteen times in the Rgveda. Out of these Varupa is certainly called dhṛtavrata in seven passages viz. in. I. 25.8 and 10, I. 44. 14, I. 141.9, II, 1. 4,22 VIII. 27.3 and X, 66. 5. Both Mitra and Varuna are styled 'dhṛtavrata' in I. 15.6, VIII. 25.2 and 8 (and also ‘ksatriyā' in verse 8), Indra and Varuṇa are said to be dhṛtavrata in VI. 68. 10, Indra alone in VI. 19. 5 and VIII. 97. 11, the Adityas in II. 29. 1, Viśvedevāh in X. 66. 8 (and also * ksatriyāḥ'), Agni in VIII. 44. 25 and Savit; in IV. 53. 4. Prof. Apte (p. 430 para 37) avers that Varuṇa is pre-eminently called dhṛtavrata (this is not quite accurate as more than half the passages in which the word 'dhrtavrata' occurs refer to gods other than Varuna), because he maintains intact the paths he has excavated for the luminaries or he sees that the fixed laws of the movements of luminaries are properly observed. Unless one has made up one's mind that vrata signifies tracks of luminaries or their fixed movements, these 'dhrtavrata' passages are of no help in settling the original meanings of vrata. They can all be well construed by taking 'dhṛtavrata' in the sense of ‘one who upholds or supports his ordinances'. Supposing that Prof. Apte is right in thinking that the epithet pre-eminently applies to Varuṇa it is quite arguable that what is mainly aimed at in calling Varuna 'dhrtavrata' is the high moral level Varuṇa is held by the Rgvedic sages to maintain by punishing sinners, by looking into the truth and falsehood of men (VII. 49. 3 'satyānste avapaśyan janānām'), by the fact that he is styled 'ksatriya', 'rājan' and 'samrāj' (who exacts obedience to his laws) as shown above. Therefore, the view that vrata means ordinances in connection with Varupa is far more appropriate than the theory about his seeing that the luminaries follow their tracks. In this connection the word 'dhrtavrata'23 in 1. 25.6 .

Meaning of Vrata 

becomes very important. Almost all scholars hold that that verse means '(Mitra and Varuna) fond of the donor who observes the laws of religious worship partake of the same offering (made by the donor) and they are not heedless about it (or do not miss it). Scholars hold that in this verse the word 'dhrtavrata' applies to a human worshipper and not to a god as in all other passages. Prof. Apte (p. 430 para 37) explains that the words 

dhṛtavratāya dāśuse', moan 'donor who makes a gift to (Varupa) that is dhṛtavrata.' This construction is objectionable for several reasons. There are two deities referred to in the principal sentence (the verb is 'āśāte), while dhṛtavratāya, being singular, can only be construed with one deity. Prof. Apte further relies on VIII. 94.2 of which he gives an interpretation which as shown above is wrong. Constructions parallel to 'dhrta vratāya dāśuge' and containing an adjective of the word 

dāśuse' are found in other Rgveda passages. For example, in I. 142. 1 we have 24 'O Agnil spread the ancient thread (i. e. sacrifice) for the worshipper who has extracted Soma juice', Here the words 'sutasomāya dāśuse' do not mean 'to the wor. shipper who gives offerings to the god who extracts soma'. Similarly, in VIII, 5.6 the words 'sudevāya dāśuse' mean 'to or for the worshipper (or donor) who worships god' (or for donor to whom gods are beneficent). These several considerations make it highly probable that 'dhṛtavratāya' is an attribute of a human being in I. 25.6 and not necessarily of Varuṇa. If that be so, vrata in 'dhrtavrata' must mean'ordinances or mode of religious worship and not 'tracks of luminaries'. We have the word 'dhrtadaksa' (who upholds strength i. e. who is strong or constant) applied to a priest in X. 41. 3. It is worthy of note that the Satapatha Br. in explaining 25 niṣasāda dhrta vrato Varupaḥ' in Rg. 1. 25. 10 (= Vāj. S. X. 27) remarks that the king and a brāhmaṇa deeply learned in the Veda are both dhṛtavrata'. It is probable that even in the times of the Rgveda people had come to assign the same meaning to the word 

dhṛtavrata' that the Sat. Br. ascribes to it. Conceding for argument that dhrtavratāya in I, 25. 6 refers to Varuna, that does not at all solve the problem of the derivation and meaning of vrata. The word 'vratanlı' occurs only once in Roveda X.

65. 6 and probably means '(the cow) that is the carrier of vrata' i. e. of the milk on which a sacrificer has to subsist. In T. S. V1. 2. 5. 2–3 it is said that milk is the Brāhmaṇa's vrata. On p. 442 Prof. Apte refers to Sūrya being called 'vratapā' very aptly. Vratapa occurs nine times in the Rgveda, but the Sun is called 'vratapā' only once in I. 83. 5. Vratapā means nothing more than vratapati, which word occurs in T. S. 1. 6. 6. 326, 1. 6.7. 2 and Vāj. S. I. 5 and is applied to Agni. In these passages 'vrata' means a religious vow such as that of a Vedic student who undertakes to study Veda after Upanayana. There is no reason why the word "vratapā' in the Rgveda should not be deemed to have been used in the sense in which 'vratapati' is employed in the T. S. and Vāj. S. Similarly, in Rg. VII. 103. 127 it is said that the frogs lying silent for a year (in crevices), like brāhmapas observing a vrata, send forth their croaking inspired by the rains. Here 'vrata' has the meaning a sacred vow or observance' which is the sense in which the word is used in medieval times and is so used even upto this day. 

There is one more word viz. vrṣavrata, which is analogous to 'dhrtavrata' and which remains to be considered. That word occurs only twice (i. o. in Rg. IX. 62. 1128 and IX. 64. 1) and is an attribute of Soma. Prof. Apte (p. 485, section 48) tries to fit this word in his scheme by referring to the description of Soma as bellowing like a bull, as a bull among cows and as brandishing and sharpening his horns. One must not forget the twofold character of Soma as a very pre-eminent deity (the whole of Rg. IX. is a glorification of Soma ) and as a beverage produced from the twigs and tendrils of the Soma plant and that these two characters become mixed up. In the process of producing Soma beverage, four sounding holes called uparavas are employed29 (vide H. of Dh. vol. II. pp. 1154-55

Meaning of Vrata 

for 'uparavas'): This is described as the bellowing of Soma, when Soma is called a vrsa (bull) or vrsabha. Most of the great Vedic gods (Indra, Agni, Soma and others), their chariots, their weapons and even the exhilaration on drinking Soma are spoken of as bulls.30 When Soma twigs are being pressed with stones (grāvan) the tendrils of Soma look like horns. All these descrip tions about bellowing &c. apply strictly to the soma plant and are poetically transferred to the deity Soma. Prof. Apte translates 'yṛsavrata' as 'whose behaviour or deportinent is like that of a bull'. On the other theory also we can easily explain the word as meaning '(Soma) whose ordinances are powerful like a bull'. Vrṣavrata is an attribute of god Soma and cannot be easily construed with god Soma, if vrata primarily means some physical activity and its implications are rather against Prof. Apte's theory. 

The result of this long discussion is that Prof. Apte's theory of the derivation of vrata from the root vṛt' and his long scheme of meanings is not proved and that the derivation from the root 'vr'expressly stated by Yāska at least twenty-five centuries ago and accepted by most scholars has not been at all shaken. Prof. Apte probably did not anticipate that the meaning he assigned to 'vit' would be challenged, but I dispute that meaning also. 

There are three passages of the Rgveda in which the words 'yittam na cakram'(like a round wheel) occur, viz I. 155. 6 (addressed to Viṣṇu), IV. 31. 4, V. 36. 3 (both addressed to Indra). Prof. Apte did not mention them and they have no bear ing on the derivation of vrata. At the most those might have been relied upon for the meaning of the root 'vrt'. In this discussion we have restricted ourselves to verbal forms or present participles and omitted past passive participles which sometimes depart very much from the root-meaning as in the case of 'ksta' in Rgveda X 43.5 (krtam na svaghni vi cinoti dovane). Vṛtta' cannot mean revolving even if yṛt meant 'to revolve', it is vartamāna that might have that meaning if yot' originally meant to revolve'. Besides, Rg. I. 155.6 is obscure. It probably refers to the belt of the zodiac that goes round the sky. 

It is necessary to clarify the meanings and mutual relations of the three words sta, vrata and dharman. The meanings (three) 

30. Oply one verse need be quoted to illustrate the above. Rg. II, 16. 6 is वृषा ते वज्र उत ते वृषा रथो वृषणा हरी वृषभाण्यायुधा। वृष्णो मदस्य त्वनीशिष इन्द्र सोमस्य वृषभस्य तृपणुहि ।

History of Dharmaśā ra 



of șta' have been specified in H. of Dh. vol. IV. pp. 2–5 and the meanings of vrata have been discussed in what precedes (vide pp. 5-8). In the Rgveda the word is dharman and not dharma. For a brief discussion of dharman vide H. of Dh, vol. I, p. 1. In the Rgveda sometimes dharman is masculine and often an adjective, meaning 'upholder or sustainer' as in Rg. I, 187. 1, X. 92. 2. In X. 21.3 (tve dharmāṇa āsate) the word is masculine. In other cases it is obviously in the neuter gender as in I. 22. 18 (ato dharmāpi dhārayan), V. 26.6, IX. 64. 1. In these passages the meaning seems to be 'religious rites or sacrifices', thus approaching vrata in one of its senses. In I. 164. 43 and 50 (= X. 90.16) sacrifices are said to be the primeval dharmans. Vide also 'prathamā dharmā' in Rg. III. 17. 1 and 'sanatā dharmāṇi' in Rg. III. 3.1. In some cases this sense of dharman would not do, as in IV. 53, 3, V. 63. 7. where the meaning seems to be 'fixed principles or rules of conduct'. In some cases dharman appears to mean almost the same thing as 'vrata'. For example, in VII. 89. 531 the sage says 'when we destroy (or violate) your dharmans through heedlessness (or infatuation), do not harm us, O Varuṇa, on account of that sin', which is just the same as Rg. I. 25. 1, where we have 'vratam' for dharmāpi. In VI. 70.133 it is said 'heaven and earth, neper decaying and endowed with plenty of seed, are held firmly apart by the dharman of Varuna'. In VIII. 42.1 (cited above) making the Heaven firmly fixed is described as one of the vratas of Varupa. 

Though in this way in somne passages even of the Rgveda the senses of 'vrata' and 'dharman' appear to have coalesced, there are verses where all the three words or two of the three occur. It may be noted that even in what are regarded by Western scholars to be later portions of the Atharvaveda (e. g. 18.2.7, 14. 1. 51) the word is dharman. All three words occur in Rg. V. 63.733 O wise Mitra and Varuṇa!
