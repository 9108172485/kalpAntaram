<p>begin in the morning (but begins in the afternoon) the saṅkalpa has to be made in the morning provided a vrata is to be perform ed on that tithi though it be viddhā. If no saṅkalpa is made the person secures very little benefit from the vrata 209 and half the merit is lost.</p>
<p>It is now time to turn to individual vratas on the several tithis. First comes the pratipad-vrata.</p>
<p>It will be shown in the next section how in ancient and medieval times the month in which the year began was different at different times and in different countries. We shall begin with the pratipad of the month of Caitra, shall take the month as ending with amāvāsyā (amānta) and set out from Caitra the important vratas and festivals in each month and the tithis therein, and the rest will be entered in the list of vratas appended to this section on vratas.</p>
<p>In those parts of India (such as the Deccan) where the year begins with Caitra, the first tithi is observed with some pomp and religious ceremony. Most of the medieval digests such as Kalpataru (Naiyatakāla pp. 377–382), Hemādri (on vrata vol. I. pp. 360–365), Kr̥tyaratnākara (pp. 103-110), Vratarāja (pp. 49-53) quote from the Brahmapurāna the rites of the beginning of the year on the first tithi of Caitra bright half. That Purāṇa 210 states that Brahmā created the world on the first day of the bright half of Caitra at sunrise, and started the reckoning of time. On that tithi a mahāśānti (propitiatory rite) destroying all untoward occurrences and sins should be offered and first Brahmā should be worshipped with the well-known upacāras and then the other gods with mantras preceded by om and the word namaḥ (om namo Brahmaṇe tubhyam), to all divisions of time from the minutost to yugas and to daughters of Daksa and lastly to Viṣṇu, then honour brāhmaṇas with food and fees, give presents to relatives and servants, homa should be offered to Agni called Yavistha, special food should be prepared and a great festival should be celebrated. The Bhaviṣyapurāṇa says</p>

<p>Caitraprati pad-vrata</p>
<p>that since it was declared by Brahma to be the best among tithis and thus placed in the first place it is called Pratipad. On Caitra pratipad there is worship of the lord of the year, viz. the lord of the week-day 211 on which pratipad falls, arches and banners should be raised by each householder, one should anoint one&rsquo;s body with oil and have a bath, one should eat leaves of the nimba tree (that are bitter) and should hear from the reciter of the calendar the name of the year (saka or samvat), its lord and the deities that would be the ministers for the year, the governing deities of all corns and fluids &amp;c. Even in these days priests go about in the Deccan to the houses of their patrons and read from the pancānga (almanac) the details about the lord of the year &amp;c. set out above, people raise a pole with silk cloth at top covered with a silver or brass pot, offer worship to the pole with sandalwood paste, flowers &amp;c. and eat nimba leaves. This latter is done even in Saurastra, though the people employ samvat reckoning.</p>
<p>The rule is that the pratipad to be celebrated is that which exists at the time of sunrise. If pratipad exists at sunrise on two days, then the earlier of the two is to be chosen or if there be no pratipad at sunrise on any day then the one which is pūrva viddhā should be chosen. For example, if there is amāvāsyā for four ghaṭikās after sunrise, then there is pratipad for 56 ghaṭikās and one ghaṭikā more on the next day, then the pratipad though affected by amāvāsyā will have to be chosen for the beginning of the year and not the pratipad intermixed with second tithi the next day. If Caitra be an intercalary month then 212 the opinion of many writers is that the pratipad of the intercalary month should be held to be the beginning of the year. The Samayamayūkha holds that when Caitra is an intercalary month the year and spring commence with it, but the ceremonial bath with oil and listening to the recital of the saka year should</p>

<p>be done in the pure month. The 213 Dharmasindhu makes a difference by saying that the ceremonial bath with oil should be taken on the occasion of the commencement of the new year and repeating the name of the new year should be done on the first day of the intercalary month, but the raising of the pole, eating of nimba leaves, listen ing to the recital of the almanac should be done in the pure month. In popular belief caitra-śuddhapratipad is one of the 34 most important muhurtas (auspicious days) of the year. The Sāmrājya-laksmīpithika (pp. 128-133) gives a very elaborato description of the great festival on caitra-buddha first performed by a king or a chieftain or a zamindar owning several villages.</p>
<p>The next important tithi in Caitra is the 9th in the bright half on which is observed the Rāmanavamīvrata and the celebration of the birth of Rāma, 7th avatāra of Viṣṇu. The principal works on which reliance is placed in Hemādri (on vrata vol. I. pp. 941-946), V. K. K. (pp. 523-529), Tithitattva (pp. 59-62), Nirṇayasindhu (pp. 83-86) and other digests are the Agastya-samhitā and Rāmārcanacandrikā of Anandavanayati, pupil of Mukundavanayati. It is somewhat remarkable that the Kr̥tyakalpataru on vrata does not deal with this. The Rāma cult appears to have become popular later than the Krsṇa cult. Though the Amarakosa gives Viṣṇu, Nārāyana, Krsna, Vasudeya, Devakinandana and Dāmodara as synonyms, it does not mention Rāma (Dāśarathi), but mentions Rāma only as a synonym of Haladhara. Here only a brief treatment of Rāma navami can be attempted. The Rāmārcanacandrikā and Vratāska (folio 173a) expressly provide that all persons including even cāṇdālas can observe Rāmanavamivrata (they have adhrkāra).</p>
<p>It is stated in the Agastyasamhitā 214 that Rāma was born at noon on the 9th of the bright half of Caitra, when Punarvasu asterism was occupied by the Moon and both the Moon and</p>

These astrological details about the birth of Rāma are in line with those in some editions of the Rāmāyana (except those of Gorresio and some others). Vide my paper on this in the Journal of the Oriental lastitute, Baroda, vol. I. pp. 1-5,Rāmanavamivrata</p>
<p>Jupiter were in conjunction and when five planets were in their ucca (exaltation), when the zodiacal sign rising on the eastern horizon was Karkataka (Cancer), and when the Sun was in the sign of Mesa (Aries). The Kālanirṇaya of Madhava (pp. 229– 230) lays down the following. When navami is spread over two days, then, if there is navami at noon only on the earlier of the two days, the vrata should be performed on that day. If there is navami at noon on both days, or if there is no navami at noon on any day, then the vrata should be performed on navami mixed with daśamī (and not on navami mixed with astamī). 215 If the 9th tithi is conjoined to Punarvasu asterism that day, that tithi is most holy. Even when there is conjunction of astami, navami and Punarvasu, still the vrata should be on the next day (i. e. on navami with daśamī). There are further minute rules and differences on this which are passed over here.</p>
<p>It is stated that the Rāmanavamīvrata is nitya (obligatory) for all, while others say that it is obligatory only for devotees of Rāma and kāmya (optional) for those that desire special rewards (such as removal of sin, mukti or release from samsāra). The Agastya-samhitā 216 remarks &lsquo;This (vrata) is a course prescribed for all and it is the sole means of worldly happiness and mukti. Even a person who is impure or very sinful, having performed this best of vratas, is honoured by all and he becomes as if he were Rāma himself. That wretched man who eats food on Rāma navami suffers torments in the terrible hells called Kumbhīpāka. If a man fasts on a single Rāmanavami all his objects are fulfilled and he is released from all sins. The Agastyasambitā further prescribes on that day (on which Rāma was born) vrata in the form of a fast should always be performed and on that day the devotee intent on Rāma worship should keep awake at night, sitting on the ground&rsquo;. The use of the word &lsquo;sada&rsquo; (always) shows that the vrata is obligatory. Others say that the texts promise such rewards as removal of sin and therefore it is</p>

<p>kāmya. The conclusion of many works (like the Nirṇayasindhu and the Tithitattva) is that this vrata is both kāmya and nitya according to the Mimāṁsā maxim of &lsquo;samyogaprthaktva &lsquo;217 (Jai. IV. 3.5-7). In the section on &lsquo;Agnihotra&rsquo; the Veda says &lsquo;he makes an offering of curds in the fire&rsquo;; there is another sentence in the same, viz. &lsquo;one who desires bodily vigour should make an offering of curds in the fire&rsquo;. The meaning is that curds being separately mentioned in two different sentences which are both independent, homa with dadhi is both nitya and kāmya.</p>
<p>The procedure of Rāmanavamivrata as set out in H. V. I. pp. 941-946. N. S. pp. 83–86, T. T. pp. 59-62, K. T. V. pp, 96-98, Vratarāja pp. 319-329, Vratārka (folios 172–182 ), may be briefly described as follows:-The devotee should take a bath on the 8th tithi in the bright half of Caitra, perform his sandhyā prayer and should invite a brāhmaṇa learned in the Veda and śāstras and devoted to Rāma worship and knowing the procedure of Rāma mantras, should honour him and make a request &lsquo;I shall make a gift of the image of Rāma&rsquo;. Then he should give oil to the brāhmana for anointing his body, make him bathe, make him wear white garments and flowers, should offer him a dinner containing sāttvika food and should himself partake of the same food and constantly think of Rāma. On that day he and the ācārya honoured by him should go without food at night, should listen to the stories of Rāma the whole day and should himself sleep and make the ācārya sleep on the ground (not on a cot). The next morning he should get up, bathe, perform his sandhyā, should construct a brilliant maṇḍapa with four doors and decked with arches, banners and flowers. The eastern door should be decked with conch, wheel and (an image of) Garuḍa, bow and arrows, the western one with mace, sword and armlets and the north with lotuses, svastika signs and blue stones and prepare a raised altar four cubits (in the maṇdapa) and should provide holy songs, music and dance therein. He should have benedictions from brāhmaṇas. Then</p>

<p>he should make a saṅkalpa &lsquo;On the Ramanavami I shall observe a fast for the whole day and being intent on worshipping Rāma shall make a golden image of Rāma and shall donate it for pleasing Rāma&rsquo; and then say &lsquo;may Rāma remove my numerous heavy sins&rsquo;. The image of Rāma should be placed on a pedestal, have two hands and Janaki should be seated on the left thigh of (Rāma) image, which should be bathed with pañcāmrta, 218 then mūlamantra 219 should be recited and the usual nyāsas should be made. The festival or pūjā is performed in the noon, Then at night he should keep awake and listen to the divine stories about Rāma and be surrounded by devotees of Rama, should sing hymns about Rāma. Then the next morning he should bathe, perform sandhyā, should worship the image of Rāma with sixteen upacāras employing the 16 verses of Rg. X. 90 and with Pauraṛika verses, also perform the worship of the several limbs of the image (Sri-Rāmabhadrāya namaḥ pādau pūjayāmi and so on), offer homa on the altar or in a kunda with the mūlamantra and then in the ordinary fire offer 108 oblations of clarified butter or pāyasa (rice cooked in milk with sugar), then he should honour the ācārya with gifts of ear-rings, finger rings, flowers, clothes &amp;c. and should recite the following mantra &lsquo;O Rāma! I shall today donate this golden image of yours decked with ornaments and clothes for securing your favour; may Rāma favour me&rsquo;. He should give dakṣiṇā (fee) to the ācārya and to other brāhmapas gold, cow, a pair of clothes, corn, according to his ability and then have dinner along with the brāhmaṇas. By doing so he becomes free from even mortal sins like brāhmaṇa-murder. There is no need to say more. The man who performs this vrata has mukti in his hand (as it were) and he acquires the same merit that one secures by the dāna called Tulāpurusa 220 in</p>

<p>Kuruksetra on a solar eclipse. Hemādri is comparatively brief, but the Tithitattva (pp. 61-62), Nirṇayasindhu (p. 85), Vratārka add further details from Agastyasamhitā. They say that images of Bharata and Satrughna (by the side of Rāma image) and of Laksmana with a bow in his hand and of Dasaratha (to the right) and of Kausalyā should also be made and worshipped with appropriate Paurānika mantras (the one for Kausalyā is quoted in the note )22 The Rāmārcanacandrikā adds further details about the worship of ten and five ūvaranas to which even tho Nirṇayasindhu refers by name alone.</p>
<p>Rāmanavami is not to be celebrated in the intercalary Caitra month (malamāsa). The same rule applies to Janmāstami and other vratas.</p>
<p>In modern times not many people observe a fast on Rāma navami and hardly one performs homa or donates images, but the birth of Rāma is celebrated in Rāma temples by many at noon with great ceremony. A. Haridāsa treats a gathering of men and women assembled in the temple to a kirtan with music and bhajan on the birth of Rāma. At the end there is distribu tion of sweets or &lsquo;Suṇthavadā&rsquo; (dried ginger with sugar or jaggery) in the Deccan. In some places such as Nasik, Tirupati, Ayodhyā and Rāmeśvara this festival is performed with great pomp and thousands of people attend at these holy places. There is no holy name other than that of Rāma so constantly on Hindu lips even in these days.</p>
<p>The important tithi in Vaiśākha is the third of the bright half. It is called Akṣayya-trtiya. The earliest reference to it is probably in the Viṣṇu-dharmasūtra where it is said that one should fast on this tithi, worship Vāsudeva with whole grains of rice, should offer them into fire and donate them; thereby one becomes purified from all sins; whatever a man donates on that day becomes inexhaustible. The Matsyapurāna (chap. 65, verses 1-7), Nāradīya I. 112. 10 ff treat of this. The former states that whatever is donated or sacrificed or muttered on this tithi becomes inexhaustible (in reward), that a fast thereon yields inexhaustible results, that if this trtiyā has Kettikā asterism</p>

<p>then it is specially commended. The Bhavisyottara-purāṇa 273 (chap. 30. 1-19) deals at some length with it. It says: &lsquo;this tithi is one of the Yugādi tithis because the Kr̥ta age began on it; whatever is done on it, such as bath, gifts, muttering of sacred texts (jupa), offerings into fire, Veda study, satiating deceased ancestors (with water all that becomes inexhaustible&rsquo;. It provides that gifts of jars of water and of umbrellas and of footwear should be made (to brāhmaṇas) on this day and that what is sacrificed or donated on this day never comes to an end and therefore this tithi is called aksaya (inexhaustible) by the sāges. V. Dh. also refers to it 223The Lar plates of Govinda. candra of Kanauj recite that the king after bathing in the Ganges on the occasion of the Aksayya-trtiyā festival on Monday in sainvat 1202 (i. e. 15th April 1146 A. D.) made the grant of a village to one Sridhara Thakkura (E. I. vol. VII p. 98). The third is to be taken for these religious rites when it exists in the forenoon; but if it exists in the forenoon on two days the one that exists on the later day should be chosen for vrata. Vide Hemādri on Kāla p. 618 and on vrata vol. I, pp. 500-502, Vratarāja pp. 93–96, Sm. K. p. 109 for further details. It is provided in the Purāpas that śrāddha performed on the tithis called Yugādi gives inexhaustible gratification to the pitṛs. But no pindas (rice-balls ) are to be offered in Yugādi-śrāddha. Akṣayyatṣtiyā is one of the 3 days popularly believed to be most auspicious in the year ( it is itself 1).</p>

It is stated in the Skanda 225 and Bhaviṣya purāṇas that Viṣṇu was born from Renuki on the third of the bright half of Vaiśākha when the naksatra was Punarvasu and in the first watch of the night and when six planets were ucca (in exaltation) and Rāhu was in the zodiacal sign Mithuna (Gemini). The image of Paražurāma is to be worshipped and arghya is to be offered to it with the mantra quoted below.226 If the third tithi is suddhā (i. e. not mixed with another tithi) the vrata (i. e. fast) is to be performed that day; but if on two days there is third tithi in the evening first watch even partially, then the later one is to be the day of the fast; otherwise (if the third is viddhi, but does not extend up to the first watch of the night) the fast should be observed on the first of the two days. There are some temples erected in honour of Parasurama, particularly in the Konkana such as the one near Chiplun in which Paraśurāma jayanti is celebrated with great ceremony. Vide N. S. p. 95, Sm. K. p. 112, P. C. 89 for further details. H. V. I. p. 117 gives directions as to the image or painting of Paraśurāma.

<p>classes, of the body, of speech and of the mind) are enumerated in Manu XII. 5–7.228 The Rājamārtaṇḍa (verses 1397–1405) speaks of this vrata. The N. S. (p. 98) and some other digests put forward another basis, viz. 229 Jyestha śu. 10 on Tuesday (acc. to Varāha) or Wednesday (acc. to Skanda), on Hasta naksatra, Vyatīpāta, Gara ( karana), Ananda-yoga, the moon and sun being in Virgo and Taurus respectively&ndash;when all these concur or when most of them concur, a person should bathe in the Ganges and then become free from all sins. Wednesday and Hasta constitute Anandayoga. It was supposed that the Ganges came to the earth on this tithi, on Tuesday and on Hasta asterism and therefore originally it appears to have been a vrata of a bath in the Ganges at Daśāśvamedha, of worship and gifts. Then it was extended to a bath in any big river and offering of arghya, sesame and water. Vide Kāśikhanda, Tristhali-setu, K.T: 431, Vratarāja pp. 352-355, P. C. pp. 144-145 for further details. At present in towns and villages on the big rivers such as Krṣṇā, Godāvari, Narmadā and the Ganges, a festival of the Ganges is celebrated. At such places as Banaras, Prayāga, Haridyāra, Nasik the utsava is celebrated on a large scale. If there be an intercalary Jyestha, this vrata was to be performed in that month.</p>
<p>On the Full moon day of Jyestha women whose husbands are living perform even now in many parts of India the Sāvitri vrata or Vatasāvitrivrata. The story of Savitri whose memory has been cherished for ages by all Indian women as an ideal of a pativratā, of wifely devotion to the husband unto death (and even thereafter) is very popular and is described at great length in the Mahābhārata (Vanaparva chap. 293-299) and in the Purāṇas (such as in Matsya, chap. 208–214, Skandapurāṇa, Prabhāsakhanda chap. 166, Vispudharmottara, II chap. 36-41).

<p>is narrated230 that she married Satyavat whose death at the end of one year was predicted by the sage Nārada and that three days before the time indicated by Nārada she undertook a fast, accompanied her husband into the forest where he had gone to collect firewood, flowers and fruits as his blind father had lost his kingdom and that she had an argument with Yama the God of Death, who became so pleased with her that he gave her several boons and ultimately ber husband that had died as predicted was restored to life. The Bhaviṣyapurāna account of the story of Sāvitri is cited at great length in Kr̥tyaratnākara (pp. 264-278). Hemādri (on vrata II pp. 258–272) sets out a vrata called Brahma-Sāyitrīvrata from Bhayisyottara which contains the story of Sāvitri as in the Mahābhārata and Matsya and also (vol. II pp. 272-279) a Vatasāvitrīvrata from Skanda. But the first was performed for three days from the 13th tithi to Full Moon in Bhādrapada month and not in Jyestha, while the 2nd was to be performed on Jyestha Full Moon by a woman whose husband was living or even by a sonless widow. This last is called Mahā savitrivrata by the Vratakālaviveka (p. 20 of I. H. Q. vol. 17 No. 4 supplement).</p>
<p>The Nirṇayasindhu refers to the vrata in Bhadrapada mentioned by Hemādri and remarks 231 that it was not in vogue in its day. The Vrataprakāśa describes (folios 169–170) the Brahmasāvitrīvrata.</p>

<p>But the Vatasāvitrivrata that is now in vogue must also have been performed long before the 10th century A. D. The Agnipurana (194. 5-8) briefly describes 232 a vrata that in</p>

<p>Vatasāvitrivrata</p>
<p>essentials is the same as the modern Vatasāvitrīvrata. The Rājamārtaṇḍa says &lsquo;on the 14th 233 of the bright half of Jyestha women full of faith perform the Sāvitrivrata for being free from widowhood&rsquo;. This is followed by people in the Deccan. The Nirṇayāmṛta following the Bhaviṣya held that this vrata was to be performed on Amāvāsyā, while the Kr̥tyatattva (p. 430 ), and T. T. p. 121 say that Sāvitrīvrata is to be observed on dark 14th after the Full Moon of Jyestha.</p>
<p>If the Paurnimā is spread over two days, then the vrata is to be performed on Caturdaśī (14th tithi) mixed up with Paurnimā. The three days for which the vrata is to last may have to be begun on the 12th or 13th. But if caturdaśī is of the extent of 18 ghaṭikās and then Paurṇimā supervenes, then caturdaśī is to be given up (K. N. p. 301).</p>
<p>The worship of the Vaṭa tree comes in probably because Satyavat when the moment of death approached took shelter under the shade of the Vata tree and supported himself by &amp; branch of it and spoke in a choked voice to Savitri that he had pain in the head. 234 The procedure of this vrata as set out in the Vratarka (folios 312–320) and other late medieval works is briefly as follows:-The woman should make a saṅkalpa in the form &lsquo;I shall perform Sāvitrivrata for securing long life and health to my husband and my sons and for securing freedom from widowhood in this and subsequent lives&rsquo;. She should then sprinkle water at the root of the Vata tree and surround it with cotton threads and should perform its worship with the upacāras and then offer worship to Savitri (with image or mentally) from her feet upwards and pray to her to bestow on her beauty, good name, prosperity, and freedom from widowhood. Then she should worship Yama and Nārada and give presents (rūyana) to the priest and break her fast next day. In Bengal the mode of performing Savitri-vrata is different from the above. In Bengal there is no Vatasāvitrivrata, but there is Sāvitricaturdasi on the 14th of the dark half of Jyestha to secure blessed wifehood in later lives. It is continued for 14 years.</p>

<p>In JAOS. vol. 21 part 2 pp. 53-66 Allen has compared the Sāvitrīvrata as described in the Mahābhārata and the purānas and in Hemādri and Vratārka.</p>
<p>I have not generally tried to speculate about the remote origins, if any, of even the most important vratas. But some scholars endowed with a lively imagination and imbued with the theories underlying Frazer&rsquo;s &lsquo;Golden Bough&rsquo; have tried their hands at the origins of some vratas. The late Mr. B. A. Gupte endeavoured to explain the symbolism of the Sāvitrīvrata&rsquo; in I. A. vol. 35 (for 1906) pp. 116–119. He bases his article on the forty figures that his wife drew with sandalwood paste in celebrating the Sāvitri-vrata. He holds that the story of Savitri is based on a Nature Myth and that the first impression produced on him by the pictures drawn by his wife is that it is a marriage scene. What mainly vitiates all his imaginative explanations is that the Savitrī-vrata is not mentioned anywhere in any work that can be said to be even two thousand years old and that he thinks his wife&rsquo;s figures or pictures represent the general way of celebrating that vrata in the whole of India throughout the centuries. The Sāvitrīvrata is observed throughout India, but I have not been able to find that women all over India depict the scene as was done by Mr. Gupte&rsquo;s wife (who probably was a well educated lady and had an artistic training in some big city and turned her skill to lend charm and picturesqueness to that vrata, by adding her own artistic ideas to those of millions of unedu cated simple women in small towns and villages ).</p>
