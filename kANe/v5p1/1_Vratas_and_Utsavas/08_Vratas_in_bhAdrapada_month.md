CHAPTER VIII 

Vratas of Haritālikā, Ganesacaturthi, 

Rsipañcami, Anantacaturdaśī. 

On the 3rd tithi of the bright half of Bhadrapada occurs the Haritālikāvrata for women alone. This vrata is not found in the Kr̥tyakalpataru on vrata or in Hemādri. It is described only in the later medieval digests like the Nirṇayasindhu (p. 133), Vratārka (folios 44 6-49 b), Vratarāja (pp. 103-110) and Abalyākāmadhenu (folios 282-295). It may, however, be noted that the Rājamārtaṇḍa of Bhoja (first half of 11th century A.D.) devotes four verses to Haritālicaturthi on Bhadrapada 4th of bright half and says it is dear to Pārvati (two of them are quoted below 

in note).362 It is very much in vogue among Mahārāstra women. The following is a brief description. The woman should take an oil and myrobalan paste bath and wear fine silken clothes. After referring to the tithi &c. the woman should make saṅkalpa as noted below.363 She should bow to Umā and Siva; she should offer worship to Umā by means of the 16 upacāras with appropriate mantras such as āvāhana (invoking to be present), āsana (seat), pādya, arghya &c. After offering flowers the per former should carry out worship of the limbs of Umā from the feet in the form 'bow to Umā, I worship her feet' to the head. Then she should offer incense, lamp, naivedya, āca maniya, fragrant substances like camphor and sandalwood for rubbing on the hands, betelnut, tumbāla, dakṣiṇā, ornaments, nirājana (waving of a lamp). She should then offer worship to the several names of Umā (such as Gauri, Pārvati &c.) and the several names of Siva (such as Hara, Mahādeva, Sambhu &c.) and present a handful of flowers, and go round (pradaksiṇā) the images of Umā and Maheśvara, make with an appropriate mantra in each

case an obeisance 364 and a prayer and donate presents placed in vessels of wickerwork together with auspicious substances. 

This vrata is not prevalent in Bengal nor in Gujarat. 

It is provided by Madhava that 365 if the third is mixed up with the 2nd tithi and the 4th tithi, the vrata is to be performed on the later day, provided the third tithi exists at least for a muhūrta (two ghaṭikās) and then 4th tithi follows. 

In modern times women purchase coloured clay images of Pārvati, of Sivalinga and a friend of Pārvati and worship them. 

It is difficult to say why the vrata is called Haritālikā. The Vratarāja366 (p. 108) says it is vratarāja (the prince among vratas) and was so called because Pārvati was taken away (from home) by her friends. 

The Vratarāja contains a story said to have been narrated by Siva himself to Parvati about the vrata by performing which she secured him as her husband and also the position of boing half of Siva's body. The Varāhapurāṇa (chap. 22) contains a long narrative about the marriage of Gauri with Siva. 

On the 4th of the bright half of Bhadrapada is observed the festival of Gaṇeśacaturthi in many parts of India (though not in Bengal or Gujarat). According to the Samayamayūkha,367 Ganesacaturthi is also called Varadacaturthi. The proper time for the performance is mid-day, as said by Bṛhaspati 368 quoted in the Kālanirnaya. When Caturthi-tithi is mixed up with the

3rd tithi and also with 5th, then, if at midday there is caturthi, the one mixed with the 3rd is to be preferred. If at midday there is no caturthi, but on the next day there is caturthi at 

midday mixed with pancami, then parariddhā (i. e. mixed with the following 5th) is to be preferred.369 Briefly, the procedure is as follows. In modern times a clay image of Ganesa beautifully painted is brought, and prūnapratisthū is effected and worship is offered to Vināyaka with 16 upacāras; two dūrvā tendrils with sandalwood paste are offered with each of ten names 370 quoted below (i. e. in all 20 dūrvā tendrils) and after reciting all the ten names together the remaining one dūrvā (21st) is offered. 21 modakas are got ready and placed before the image ; one is offered as naivedya, ten are donated to brāhmanas, ten are eaten by the performer himself (or his family).371 The P. C. p. 94 and Vratarāja (pp. 144-151) give a more elaborate procedure. If Bhādrapada 4th of bright half falls on a Sunday or Tuesday this caturthi is called great 372 (mahati). The important vedic mantra in the worship of Ganesa is Rg. II. 23. 1 = Tai. S. II. 3. 14. 3 (Gaṇānām tvā Ganapatim havāmahe) which is really addressed to Brahmanaspati, but in medieval and modern conceptions Ganesa takes over the characteristics of that Vedic god. The number 21 is important in Ganesacaturthi. 

The form of Gaṇeśa to be contemplated upon is described as follows : 373 'one should contemplate on God Siddhi vināyaka who has only one tusk; whose ears are wide like a winnowing basket, who has nūga (snake) worn in the way of yajñopavīta and wields in his hands a snare and goad.' 

In medieval times and also in modern times the popular belief was and is that if one happens to see the moon on Gaṇeśa

caturthi evening one is falsely charged with the commission of a theft or the like. If one sees the moon on that date by mistake, in order to escape the consequence of a false charge, one should repeat the Paurāṇika verse addressed by a child's nurse to it A lion killed Prasenajit, the lion was killed by Jāmbavat; don't cry, O Sukumāraka (or tender boy)! this is your Syamantaka jewel':374 The story is referred to in Mausalaparva 3. 23 and is narrated in several Purāṇas. Vide Vāyu 96. 20-52, Agni 175. 40-44, Matsya chap. 45, Viṣṇu-purāna IV. 13. 3-18, Bhāgavata X Uttarārdha, Padma V. 13.78–93 and VI. 276. 56,5-37, Brahma 16. 12-45. The Sun is said to have given to Prasena's brother, Satrājit, the highly refulgent Syamantaka jewel that produced eight bhāras of gold every day (Bhāgavata X. 56. 11 ); Krspa hankered after it but could not secure it. Prasena decked with the jewel went hunting and was killed by a lion, the latter in its turn was killed by the bear leader Jambavat, who took the jewel and entered his own lair with it. Satrājit and the Yādavas suspected Krsna as having brought about the death of Prasena for the sake of the jowel. Kļspa, unable to bear the calumny, ultimately traced the corpses of Prasena and of the lion and entered the cave of Jāmbavat on hearing the above verse addressed by the nurse from inside the cave. Krsna fought inside the cave a duel with Jāmbayat and when Krspa did not come out for days the Yādava followers of Krṣpa returned to Dvārakā and reported that Krsna was killed. Jāmbavat was defeated after 21 days (28 acc. to Bhāgavata X. 58, 24), made peace with Krsna by giving in marriage his daughter Jāmbavati to Krsna and the Syamantaka jewel as a dowry. Krsna on returning to Dvārakā handed over the jewel to Satrājit, brother of Prasena, and cleared himself of the false charge. Some Purāṇas like Vāyu 96.52 and Matsya 375 45. 34 state that who

ever knows this story about the clearance of Krsna from a false charge would not be liable to have a false charge made against him by any one. The Tithitattva 376 provides that if a man inadvertently sees the moon on the night of the 4th in Bhādra (śukla) he should repeat the verse of the nurse quoted above over some water, drink it and should listen to the story of the Syamantaka jewel. 

When Ganesa is worshipped on Bhādra 4th of bright half, that tithi is called, according to Bhavisya, Sivā, when Ganesa is honoured on Māgha-sukla 4 it is called Santā, and when on the 4th of the bright half the weekday is Tuesday that caturthi is called Sukhā. The three 377 are respectively described in Hemādri (vrata) vol. I pp. 512-513, pp. 513-514 and pp. 515-519. 

In modern times the worship of Ganesa lasts for one day and a half, for two days, 5 days, 7 days or till Anantacaturdaśi (14th of bright half of Bhādra), according to the usages of the people, their inclinations and their tastes. The image is then immersed in a well, tank or in the sea in a great procession. In certain parts of the Deccan and among common people it is customary to perform Gaurīpūjā on 7th and 8th of Bhādrapada sukla and immerse Gauri (represented by a sheaf of plants) and Gapeśa image on the same day and at the same time on 9th. 

Gapeśa is the most popular god in these days and it is the practice to invoke him at the beginning of every important undertaking or rite. He is the God of wisdom, the presiding deity of literature, the bestower of success and the destroyer of obstacles. 

About the antiquity of Ganesa worship and of images of Gaṇośa a good deal has been said in H. of Dh, vol. II. pp. 213-216 and 725. A few matters not mentioned there may be set out bere. The Brahmavaivarta-purāna has a section called Ganesa khanda (in 46 chapters), wherein several legends about Ganesa are dwelt upon The Ganapatyatharvaśīrsa 378, imitating the

style of such ancient Upanisads as the Taittiriya, Brhadā ranyaka and Chandogya, identifies Ganapati with the Highest Brahma. The Ahalyākāmadhenu quotes passages from Bhavisyottara-purāna on Ganesacaturthi. in I. A. vol. 35 p. 60 an archaeological and mystic explanation is offered about the mouse being the conveyance of Ganeśa and his elephant head, which is fantastic and hardly convincing. Several legends are told about Ganesa, his elephant head, his single tusk. Vide Mukerji p. 9. One of the most fantastic is the one in the Varāha purāṇa (chap. 23) where it is said that from the laugh of Siva sprang a very handsome boy whom Pārvati looked at with admiring eyes when Siva's jealousy was roused and he cursed the boy to be elephant-headed and pot-bellied and then be relented and made him the chief of all Vinayakas. 

The Krtykalpataru (on vrata) pp. 84-87 quotes a passage from the Narasimha-purāna 379 (chap. 26. 2-20) about Ganesa caturthi-vrata, which also occurs anong several vratas about Ganesa set out in Hemādri (on vrata vol. I pp. 510-512). It differs considerably from the celebration of Ganesacaturthi described above. A few important points are stated here, Gapesa is described as having one, two or four tusks and as having four arms. It is further stated that Gapeśa causes obstacles (vighna) if not worshipped at the beginning of every undertaking. Gapeśa assumed the form of an elephant for effecting the purposes of gods and thereby frightened all dānaras. 

On the 5th tithi of the bright half of Bhadrapada occurs the Rṣipañcami-vrata. It was meant for men of all varnas but is now mostly practised by women. Hemādri (on vrata, vol. I. pp. 568-572) describes the prata at length quoting from the Brahmānda-purāṇa. One should, after bathing in a river or the like and after performing his daily duties, repair to his agnihotra shed, should bathe with Pañcāmrta the images of the seven sages and, anointing them with sandalwood paste and camphor, worship them with flowers, fragrant substances, incense, lamp, white clothes and yajñopavītas and sumptuous naivedya and offer

them arghya 380 with the mantra noted below. One should, when engaged in this vrata, subsist on vegetables alone and observe celibacy. The result is freedom from all sins and from troubles of three kinds 381 and the increase of one's good fortune. If a woman performs this vrata she enjoys happiness, becomes endowed with good bodily form, beauty and sons and grandsons. 

Later medieval digests like the Vratārka (folio 90), Vratarāja (pp. 200-206) add details and a story from Bhavisyo ttara narrated to Yudhisthira by Krsna. The sin of Brahmahatyā (brāhmana-murder), of which Indra became guilty by killing Vrtra, son of Tvastr, was distributed in four places viz. in Agni (the first flames mixed with smoke), rivers (turbid in the rains), mountains (on which trees exuding sticky gum grow) and among women (in their monthly illness). Therefore this vrata should be performed particularly by women for getting rid of the sin of contact during their monthly illness. 

The saṅkalpa is given below.381a Another detail is that the seven sages together with Arundhati are to be worshipped. It is further provided that one should subsist on vegetables 382 or nivāras or śyāmāka grains or bulbous roots or fruits and should not eat anything produced by ploughing the land. Even in these days those who perform this vrata do not eat corn produced by employing oxen. In modern times if men perform the vrata the priest invokes for them seven sages with Vedic mantras viz. Rg. IX. 114. 2 (for Kasyapa), Rg. V. 78. 4 (for Atri), Rg. VI. 25.9

The mantra for Arundhati is quoted below.383 In this vrata the number seven is important. The vrata is to be performed for seven years, there are to be seven jars, seven brāhmaṇas were to be invited to whom finally the images (made of gold or silver) of the seven sages were to be donated. If all the images were placed in one kalaśa, then the jar with the images was to be donated to one brāhmaṇa and the others were to be given kalaśas with clothes and daksiṇā. 

If pañcami is mixed up with the 4th tithi and the 6th tithi, one must perform the Rsipañcami vrata on the 5th mixed with the 4th (pūrvaviddhā) and not on 5th mixed with 6th, in accord ance with the Yugmavākya quoted above (n. 191). Besides, Hārsta expressly 384 prohibits the acceptance of the 5th mixed with the 6th in the words (5th tithi mixed with the 4th should be accepted and not the 5th joined to the 6th, both in the bright and dark halves and in rites for the gods and pitys). But there is the most important rule laid down by Hārīta himself that in all vratas comprising worship the tithi to be selected is the one that covers mid-day 385 Supposing that the 5th tithi does not cover mid-day when joined with 4th, but covers mid-day when joined with 6th, the latter (paraviddhā) would have to be chosen. Hemādri would hold this latter view, while Mādhava holds that everywhere 5th which is pūrvaviddhā is to be accepted. Hence there is diver gence of view among the great writers. 

It appears that originally the Rsipañcami-vrata was meant for the removal of sins for all, but later on it came to be specially provided for women; but it is not observed in Saurāstra. 

On the 14th of the bright half of Bhadrapada is celebrated the Anantacaturdaśī-vrata. It does not appear in the Kr̥tya kalpataru (on vrata). 

It consists chiefly in the worship of Hari as Ananta and in wearing on the the right hand in the case of men and on the left

in the case of women a holy strap of thread dyed with saffron made of cotton or silk twisted into fourteen knots. It is an individual pūjā and not a festival of a socio-religious character. The Agnipurāṇa (chap. 192, verses 7-10) gives a brief description as follows. On the 14th of the bright half one should worship the image of Ananta (Hari) which is made of darbha grass placed in a vessel for water (a jar). He should get ready flour of a prastha of paddy and make cakes from that, half of which should be donated to a brāhmana and the remaining half he should use for himself. One should perform this vrata on the bank of a river and listen to stories about Hari and (pray to Hari) as follows:386 O Vāsudeva! save (people) sunk in the great and endless ocean of saisūra and make them apply themselves to the contemplation of the form of Ananta; salutation to thee that hast numerous forms! Having worshipped (Hari) with this mantra and having tied on one's arm or round one's neck a string of threads over which a mantra has been uttered, the person who performs the Anantavrata becomes happy. If Hari is Ananta, then fourteen knots may be deemed to symbolize the fourteen worlds created by Hari. 

Hemādri (on vrata vol. II, pp. 26–36) has an elaborate description of Anantavrata together with the story of Kaupdinya and his wife Śilā told by Krsna to Yudhisthira. Krspa states that Ananta is one of his forms and identifies himself with Kāla (Time) that is called Ananta. Ananta should be worshipped with the upacāras of sandalwood paste, incense, flowers, naivedya. 

In front of the image of) Ananta should be placed a doraka dyed with saffron and having fourteen knots. The mantra (quoted in note) should be recited and the doraka should be tied on one's arm, one should then dine with an easy mind after contemplating on Nārāyana as Ananta. In the story it is narrated how because the husband Kauṇdinya from youthful rashness and pride cut the Ananta thread tied round his wife's hand he lost everything, then repented and was taken into favour by Ananta. The V, K, K. (pp. 324-339) describes at great length the procedure of Anantapūjā together with stories taken

from the Bhavisyottara, and the Tithitattva also (p. 123 ) quotes portions from the Bhavisyottara. The Kālanirnaya (p. 279) expressly states that the Anantavrata is described in the Bhavisyottara and discusses a few verses therefrom. The Vratārka (folio 277a-285a) describes this vrata at great longth. Briefly it is this: first saṅkalpa, then making a sarvato-thadra mandala and placing a jar thereon, on which is placed a nāga with seven hoods made of darbhas and in front of it a doraka with 14 knots, worshipping the doraka on the jar with 16 upa cāras with the Purusasūkta (Rg. X. 90) and Paurānika mantras; 14 devatās of the knots from Viṣṇu to Vasus are invoked, then there is worship of the limbs from the feet upwards in such mantras as "Anantāya namah padau pūjayāmi,' then a handful of flowers with the mantras of Viṣṇu, prayer to Ananta, tying the doraka with a mantra, casting away the old doraka after offering it worship. Salt is forbidden in this vrata. It was 387 believed that if this vrata was performed for fourteen years, one reached the world of Viṣṇu. 

There is a variance in the views of eminent writers about the exact time and the tithi for the vrata whon 14th is mixed with other tithis (13th or Paurpimā). Mādhava 388 holds that mid-day is not the karmakāla in this vrata, but that tithi which exists at sunrise for three muhurtas is the most suitable one for Ananta-vrata. The Nirṇayasindhu holds 389 that Madhava was mistaken because he relied for his decision on a general rule that the principal tithi to be accepted is the one that covers mid-day, that the Anantavrata is not mentioned in other purāpas and also in other digests and that the passages of the Bhavisya and Skanda quoted by others are baseless and unauthoritative. 

There are even in these days many persons who engage in the Anantacaturdaśī-vrata, but their numbers are rapidly diminishing.
