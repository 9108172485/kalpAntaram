CHAPTER VI 

CĀTURMĀSYA 

On Āsādha-sukla ekādaśī or dyādaśī or paurnimā 317 or on the day when the Sun enters the Zodiacal sign Cancer, cāturmāsya vrata is to be observed. Whenever it may be begun it is to be finished on Kārtika-sukla 12. The performer should observe a a fast that day, worship Viṣnu (image) and pray as follows: (Garudapurāṇa I. 121. 2–3) 'O God! I have undertaken this vrata in your presence; may it succeed without obstacles if you become favourable to me; after I undertake this vrata if I die when it is half-finished, may it become completely fulfilled through your favour'! The yrata may be begun even when Jupiter or Venus has become invisible and the like. The per former has to give up some edible during the four months, viz. vegetables in Srāvana, curds in Bhādrapada, milk in Āśvina and pulses in Kārtika. According to some authorities, he has to give up some or all vegetables for all the four months. The performer is asked to give up many other things also such as sleeping on a cot, meat, honey &c. When the prata is finished, he invites brāhmanas, announces to them what restrictions he had undertaken, feeds them, gives them dakṣiṇā, and recites the prayer 'O Lord I this vrata was undertaken by me in order to please you; O Janārdana! may it become complete through your favour, whatever defect there may be!' This yrata is even now observed, particularly by women. The Krtyatattva (p. 435), Vratārka, Vrataprakāśa (folio 105a) and other medieval digests quote long passages from the Matsya, Bhavisyottara (1. 6-9) and other purāṇas about the results of giving up certain things in the Cāturmāsyayrata. A few passages are set out for sample: 'a man secures a sweet voice by giving up jaggery, has charm ing limbs by giving up oil, by giving up ghee he secures beauty, by giving up fruits he becomes intelligent and has many sons, by giving up vegetables and leaves he secures well-cooked

In the Vedic period there were sacrifices called Cāturmāsyas (seasonal sacrifices) that were performed on the Full Moon days of Phālguna (or Caitra), of Āsādha and Kārtika and were respectively called Vaiśvadeva, Varuṇapraghāsa and Sākamedha (the fourth called Sunāsiriya need not detain us). Vide H. of Dh, vol. II. pp. 1091–1106. It was expressly stated by Apastamba Srauta VIII. 4. 13 that Vaiśvadeva (parvan of Cāturmāsya) was to be offered in vasanta and Varuṇapraghāsa in the rainy season. It may be noted that the sacrificer in these seasonal sacrifices had to keep certain observances such as sleeping on the ground,319 avoiding meat, honey, salt, sexual intercourse and bodily decorations, which closely resemble the restrictions laid on the person observing Ekādasiyrata. The Yājñavalkya-smrti 320 (I. 125) makes it obligatory on a person of means to offer & Soma sacrifice every year, a paśubandha in each ayana, the Āgrayanesti (performed when new crops are ready) and the cāturmāsyas. The cāturmāsyas meant here are the Vedic ones mentioned above and not the Paurāpika yratas of cāturmāsya. 

The Yājñavalkya-smrti employs the word vrata in the sense of prāyaścitta in III. 251, 252, 254, 266, 269, 282, 298, 300, in the sense of 'brahmacarya' in III, 15, and in the sense of the food to be subsisted upon in III, 289, but hardly ever in the sense of a rite to be observed on a tithi or week day or nakṣatra as in the purāṇas. This at least indicates that the vratas mentioned in the purānas had not attained prominence in the time of the Yājñavalkya-smrti, which, in spite of its containing over 1000 verses, hardly ever refers to any vrata in the sense of the purānas.
