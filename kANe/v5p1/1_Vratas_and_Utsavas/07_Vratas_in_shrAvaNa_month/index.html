  <p>CHAPTER VII</p>
<p>Vratas called Nāgapañcami, Manasāpūjā,</p>
<p>Raksābandhana, Krsnajanmāṣtami</p>
<p>In the month of Srāvana there are several important vratas, one of which is Nāgapañcami on the 5th of the bright half of Śrāvana. The Nāgapañcami is observed in different ways in all parts of India. Some hold that, instead of Aksayyatrtiyā, Nāgapañcami is the one half auspicious day out of 3} most auspicious days in the year. The Bhaviṣyapurāpa, Brāhma parva (chapter 32 verses 1-39), expatiates on Nāgapañcami. Kr̥tyakalpataru (on vrata) pp. 87-90 and Hemādri (on vrata vol. I. pp. 557-560) quote several verses from the Bhaviṣya purāna. Briefly, the Bhaviṣya 321 says: when men on the 5th bathe with milk the nāgas called Vāsuki, Taksaka, Kaliya, Mani bhadra, Airāyata, Dhrtarāstra, Karkotaka and Dhanañjaya, these give abhaya (freedom from danger) to their families. A legend is told (in Bhaviṣya I. 32) that Kadrū, mother of nāgas, laid a bet with her sister Vinatā about the colour of the tail of Indra&rsquo;s horso called Uccaih-śravas, Kadrū asserting that the tail was black though the horse was white and Vinatā saying that the body and tail were white and when the nāgas refused to practise the deceit whereby they were to become the dark hair in the horse&rsquo;s tail, Kadrū cursed them that fire would burn them in the sarpasattra of Janamejaya). Persons should make golden, silver or clay images of nāgas, should worship them with Karavira and Jāti flowers and incense etc., feed brāhmaṇas with ghee, pāyasa etc. and should bathe nāgas with milk. The result would be that nāgas would bestow on the worshippers safety (from spake-bite). The Bhavisyottarapurāna (chap. 36) contains another method. On Srāvapa 5th (bright half) a person should draw on both sides</p>

Vide Hemādri on Kāla p. 621, K. V. p. 413, K. R. p. 234 In Saurāstra Nāgapañcami is observed in Srāvana dark half.</p>
<p>It appears that in Bengal and south India (but not in Mahārāstra) there is worship of Manasādevi in one&rsquo;s own court yard on a branch of the snuhi plant on the 5th of Srāvana dark half. The Rājamārtaṇḍa has four verses, one of which is quoted below. Samayapradipa and Kr̥tyaratnākara refer to the worship of Manasādevī. The Tithitattva322 (p. 33) contains the dhyāna of Manasādevī taken from Padmapurāṇa. First, there is a saṅkalpa 323 about the worship of Manasādevī in order to get rid of the danger from snake-bite, then one offers gandha, flowers, incense, lamp and naivedya and then Ananta and other nāgas are offered worship, the principal item being naivedya of milk and ghee. Nimba leaves are placed inside the house and the performer eats them and also makes brāhmaṇas eat them. The Brahmavaivartapurāṇa (II) devotes two chapters (45-46) to the birth of Manasādevī, her pūjā and stotra (praise) &amp;c. Dr. Sukumar Sen has edited in the B. I. series Vipradāsa&rsquo;s &lsquo;Manasāvijaya&rsquo;.</p>
<p>In the Deccan on Śrāvana bright half 5th figures of snakes are drawn with red sandalwood paste on wooden boards, or clay images of snakes coloured yellow or black are purchased and worshipped and given milk and snake charmers go about with snakes of all sorts, to which people offer milk and some money is paid to the snake charmers.</p>

<p>If pañcami is mixed with the 4th and 6th tithis, that mixed with the 6th is to be preferred. The Vratakālaviveka 324 speaks of Manasāvrata on Jyestha-sukla 10th with Hasta-nakṣatra or without it and remarks that when this vrata is performed Manasā goddess protects a man from the danger of poisonous snakes.</p>
<p>How and when serpent worship arose in India is a difficult problem. The Rgveda contains no reference to snake worship. On the contrary the Vedic god Indra is said to be the killer of ahi (a serpent) in Rg. II. 30. 1, II. 19. 3 and the slaughter of ahi is frequently mentioned as in Rg. I. 165. 6, III, 47 4. That ahi meant a serpent with a hood is clear from Rg. VI. 75. 14 (ahiriya bhogaih paryeti bāhum). In Br. Up. IV. 4.7 and Praśna IV. 5 there are references to the cast-off slough of serpents (mentioned as &lsquo;padodara&rsquo; whose feet are inside its body ) and in Rg. IX. 86. 44 ( ahir na jūrṇāmati sarpati tvacam) also. But, in many passages of the Rgveda (such as I. 32. 11) ahi appears to have a metaphorical sense and refers to a demon like Vrtra that prevented waters from flowing down. In the Tai. S. IV. 2. 8. 3. and Vāj. S. (XIII. 6-8) there are three verses that contain salutations to serpents. In the Atharvaveda (VIII. 14. 13-15) there is a reference to serpents some of which like Takṣaka and Dhrtarāstra are named. The Kāthaka S. V. 6 enumerates the pitrs, sarpas, gandharvas, waters and herbs as pancajana, and the Ait. Br. XIII. 7 asserts that gods, men, gandharvas, apsarases, snakes and pitṛs were pañcajana. This cannot be the meaning of &lsquo;pañcajanāḥ&rsquo; in Rg. X. 53. 4. The above passages show that sarpas had come to be a clan like gandharyas in late vedic times.</p>
<p>In the Āśv. gr. II. 1. 1-15, the Paraskara-gļhya II. 14 and other grhya sūtras a rite called &lsquo;sarpabali&rsquo; (offering to serpents) was performed on the Full Moon day of Srāvana. Vide H. of Dh. vol II. pp. 821-823 for a description. The nāgas figure frequently in the Mahābhārata. Vide Ādi. chap. 35 enumerat ing the names of many nāgas beginning with Sesa and chap. 123. 71, Udyoga 103. 9-16 (naming numerous nāgas).

<p>the country of the Nāgas (probably a tribe that had nāga as their emblem) and took as his wife Ulūpi, a Nāga princess who was smitten by love. Babhruvāhana, son of Citrāngadā, fought with Arjuna who had come to Manipura for protecting the Aśvamedha horse, was killed by Babhruvāhana and restored to life with the help of a Sanjivana jewel (Āśvamodhikaparva chap. 79-81). Serpents came to be associated with both Viṣṇu and Śiva. Vispu is said to sleep on the hoods of Seṣa-nāga (Vanaparva 203. 12 and 272. 38–39) and Śiva wears serpents on his body like yajñopavita (Anuśāsana 14. 55). 325 In the Bhagavadgitā X. 28-29 Lord Krsna identifies himself with Vāsuki among serpents and Ananta among nāgas. What difference is made between &lsquo;sarpa&rsquo; and &rsquo;nāga&rsquo; is not clear. Probably &lsquo;sarpa&rsquo; means all creeping things, while nāga means &rsquo;the cobra&rsquo;. The Puranas are full of stories about nāgas. Vide J. Ph. Vogel&rsquo;s painstaking work (Indian Serpent Lore, 1926) based on the Mahābhārata, the Purāṇas and the Rājatarangipi. It appears that serpent worship arose gradually from the fear of serpents that must have taken a heavy toll of life, particularly at the beginning of the rainy season. Even in these days about 10000 people die of snake bite every year in India, while persons killed by all wild animals are hardly 3000. Why the tithi was changed from Full Moon (for Sarpabali in the gļhya sūtras) to the 5th of the bright half is not clear. It may be due to the slight change in the time of the onset of rains owing to the procession of the equinoxes. Vide Fergusson&rsquo;s Tree and Serpent worship’ pp. 1-75 and Plate XV which reproduces the sculptures on the eastern gateway of Sanchi, where occurs the figure of five-headed Nāga. Stone images of serpents under sacred trees like pippala are common in the Dravida country and a few temples dedicated to nāgas exist such as the one at Battis Shirālen in Satara District and at Bhom-parānden in Hyderabad.</p>
<p>On the Full Moon of Srāvana there is in the afternoon a ceremony called Raksābandhana (tying the protective amulet). It is described by Hemādri on vrata, vol. II, pp. 190–195, N. 8. p. 121, P.C. 284-285, Vratārka (folio 335a-336a). One should at sunrise on Full Moon of Śrāyaṇa and after offering tarpaṇa to gods, sages and pitrs, get prepared a protective packet (or amulet) containing whole rice grains and mustard and deco</p>

<p>rated with gold (thread) and strung together with variously coloured threads and have such an amulet tied. In the case of a king, a jar should be placed on a square raised in the palace and the king should occupy his seat together with his ministers, he should be surrounded by courtesans and music and benedictory words should go forth; gods, brāhmaṇas and arms should be first honoured, then the royal 326 priest should tie the amulet to the accompaniment of the mantra. &lsquo;I tie on you that whereby Bali, the very powerful king of demons, was bound; O protective (amulet), don&rsquo;t slip off, don&rsquo;t slip off.&rsquo; All including sūdras and other human beings should get the amulet tied after honouring priests according to ability. When this is done, a man lives on happily for a year. Hemādri quotes Bhavisyottara for the story that Indrāni tied on the right hand of Indra a protective amulet whereby he was enabled to vanquish the asuras. This tying should not be done when paurnimā is mixed up with either 14th or the following pratipad. It may, in order to avoid these two, be done even at night.</p>
<p>This ceremony of tying an amulet on the right wrist is still in vogue and priests go about tying these amulets and receive somne fee for doing so. Mukerji (p. 81) is unduly harsh on the poor brāhmaṇas when he says that it is a day of blackmail by the priests. Women in Gujarat and some other places tie silken amulets round the wrists of their brothers and give and receive presents.</p>
<p>On the Full Moon day of Śrāvaṇa it is usual on the sea coast of western India (particularly in Konkan and Malabar) not only for Hindus, but also for Moslems and Parsis of the merchant class to go to the sea and offer flowers and a cocoanut to the sea. The sea becomes less rough and the violence of the monsoon winds abates after the Full Moon of Srāvana and the cocoanut is offered to the sea god (Varupa) in order that he may make sea voyage for vessels of merchandise safe.</p>
<p>In Śrāvana on the 8th of the dark half is celebrated the Krspajanmāstami or Janmāstami vrata and festival, which is probably the most important vrata and utsava celebrated throughout the whole of India.</p>

<p>Antiquity of Krśṇa worship</p>
<p>129</p>
<p>In some Purāṇa passages it is declared that Janmāstami is celebrated on the 8th of the dark half of Bhādrapada. The explanation is that in those passages the months are Pūrṇimānta and the dark half is in these months the first pakṣa.327 The Padma (III, 13), Matsya 56, Agni 183 contain numerous verses on the greatness (māhātmya) of Krsnajanmāstami.</p>
<p>It would not be out of place to say a few words about Kșsṇa and about the antiquity of Krsna worship. There is a reference in the Chāndogya-upanisad (III. 17. 6) to Krsna Devakīputra receiving instruction from Ghora Angirasa. There was a Vedic poet named Krsna who calls upon the Asvins to listen to his invocation in æg. VIII. 85. 3 and the Anukramani assigns Rg. VIII. 86-87 to Krsna Angirasa. Jain tradition regards Krsna as contemporaneous with Nemi, the 22nd Tirthankara, and from the account of the 63 great men of Jain pre-history about one third are shown as associated with Kșsṇa. The life of Krsna as gathered from the Mahābhārata is a composite one. In some passages he is depicted as a Yādava prince, the staunchest friend of the Pāndavas 328 (and particularly of Arjuna), as a great warrior, statesman and philosopher. In other passages he is identified with the Supreme Lord of the worlds and as Vispu Himself (Sānti 47. 28, Droṇa 146. 67–68, Karna 87.74, Vanaparva 49. 20, Bhīṣma 21. 13-15). There are most sublime praises of Krsna put in the mouths of Yudhisthira (Droṇa 149. 16-33), Draupadi (Vanaparva 263. 8-16) and Bhisma when about to die (Anuśāsana 167. 37-45). We have further information about him from the Harivamsa, the Viṣṇupurāṇa, Vāyu (98.100-102). the Bhāgavata and Brahmavaivarta that deal with Krspa&rsquo;s romantic career among cowherds, which is wanting in the Mahabharata.</p>

<p>It appears from Pāṇini (IV. 3. 98 ) 329 that there were people in his day described as Vāsudevaka and Arjunaka that were devoted to Vasudeva and Arjuna. Patañjali in his Mahābhāṣya mentions several persons and incidents connected with Krspa. On Vārtika 6 to Pān. III. 1. 26 the Mahābhāṣya gives two examples &lsquo;Kamsam ghātayati&rsquo; (meaning &lsquo;he tells the story of the slaughter of Kamsa&rsquo;) and &lsquo;Balim bhandhayati&rsquo; (meaning &lsquo;he narrates the story of the imprisonment of Bali&rsquo;). In Vārtika 2 to Pāp. III. 1.138 the word &lsquo;Govinda&rsquo; is derived from got vinda). On Vārtika 2 to Pān. III. 2. 111 Patañjali gives the example ‘Jaghāna Karsam kila Vāsudevah&rsquo; (Vāsudeva, they say, killed Kamsa) and implies that the incident occurred long ago which the speaker could not have seen but was popularly known.330 This is a cuarter of an Upendravajrā or Upajāti verse. Patañjali names Satyabhāmā with its shortened form Bhāmā (Kielhorn, vol. I. p. 111), the words &lsquo;Vasudevavargyah&rsquo; and &lsquo;Akrūravargyah&rsquo; occur (on Vārtika 11 on Pāṇ. IV.2.104). On Pāṇ. IV. 1.114 (rsyardhaka vrsni-kurubhyas-ca) under vārtika y Patañjali mentions Ugrasena as a scion of the Andhakas and Vāsudeva and Bāladeva of the Vrsnis. Patañjali quotes half of an Anustubh verse &lsquo;Saṅkarṣana-dvitiyasya balam Krsnasya vardhatām&rsquo; (Kielhorn&rsquo;s ed. vol. I. p. 426). Patañjali is regarded by most modern scholars as having flourished in the 2nd century B. C. (about 150 B. C.). Therefore it follows that some poetic work or works that referred to incidents, of Krsna&rsquo;s career (such as Kamsavadha) had been composed some centuries before the Christian era. Vide I, A. Vol. III. pp. 14-16 for allusions to Krspa in the Mahābhāṣya and I. A. vol. XIV pp. 326 ff, for verse quotations in the Mahābhāṣya collected by Kielhorn. In the Adiparva (chap. 1. 256)331 and in Sabhā 33, 10-11 Krsṇa is identified with Vāsudeva and is said to be the Highest Brahma</p>

<p>The passage about the killing of Kamsa is interesting: TEO कथं वर्तमानकालता कंसं घातयति बलिं बन्धयतीति चिरहते कंसे चिरबद्धे च बलौ&rsquo; (महाभाष्य ed, by Kielhorn, vol. II. p. 36). This shows that in the time of the HĘTH16 the killing of Kamsa (by Krsoa) was supposed to have taken place io hoary antiquity. Patañjali states further on that Kamsavadha was represented dramatically, that pictures were painted about it and lastly that works had been composed narrating that event.</p>

<p>Antiquity of Kysna worship</p>
<p>131</p>
<p>and the source of the universe. The Ghosundi inscription of 2nd or 1st century B. C. mentions the hall of worship of Saṅkar saṇa and Vāsudeva (E. I. 16 pp. 25-27, E. I, 22 p. 198, I. A. vol. 61 p. 203) addressed as &lsquo;Bhagavat&rsquo; and &lsquo;sarveśvara&rsquo;. Nanaghat cave inscriptions of about 200 B. C. mention both (A.S. W. I, vol. V pp. 60–74). The Besnagar column (Garuḍa-dhvaja ) Vaiṣṇava inscription 332 where the Bhagavata Heliodorus, son of Diya, hailing from Taksasilā and Yavana ambassador of king Antalikita (Antalkidas) to king Bhāgabhadra mentions Vāsudeva as &lsquo;devadera&rsquo;. The preceding items of evidence indicate that the worship of Vasudeva was prevalent in northern and central India from at least 500 B. C.. if not earlier. Vide R. G. Bhandarkar&rsquo;s “Vaiṣṇavism, Saivism &amp;c.&rsquo; pp. 1-45 for the various phases of the Krsna cult and its antiquity.</p>
<p>It is rather surprising that the passages quoted in the medieval works on Krsnajanmāstami are mostly borrowed from the Bhaviṣya, Bhavisyottara, Skanda, Viṣṇudharmottara, Nāradiya and Brahmavaivarta purāṇas, but hardly ever from the Bhāgavata-purāṇa which is the Veda of the Vaiṣṇavas of later medieval and modern times. The description of Krsna&rsquo;s birth in the Bhāgavata is vague and commonplace. All that 333 is said there is that the time when Krsna was born was ondowed with all good characteristics and was very charming, that the quarters looked very clear and the sky was lit up by bright stars, that the wind that blew was very pleasing to the skin and laden with fine fragrance and that when Janārdana was born of Devaki it was midnight and darkness had enveloped everything.</p>
<p>In the Bhavisyottara (44.1-69) Kṭṣpa himself is represented as narrating to Yudhisthira the incidents of Janmāstami-vrata: &lsquo;I was born of Vasudeva and Devaki on the 8th of Bhādrapada dark half at midnight when the Sun was in Lion (Leo), when the</p>

<p>Moon was in the sign of the Bull (Taurus) and there was Rohiṇi naksatra&rsquo; (verses 74-75), when on the 8th of the dark half of Sravana there is Rohini-naksatra, the tithi is called Jayanti; if a man observes a fast on that tithi, that destroys his sins committed in childhood, youth, old age and many previous lives.&rsquo; The result is that if there be no Rohiṇi naksatra on Śrāvana dark half sth, it is simply Janmāstamī, but when Rohini is joined to dark 8th of Srāvaṇa it is Jayanti. The Rājamārtaṇḍa has two verses on this.334</p>
<p>The important question is whether the Janmāstami-prata and Jayanti-vrata are really only one vrata or whether they are two separate vratas. The Kalanirṇaya,335 after a long discus sion in which Mimamsa principles contained in Jai. II. 2.23 and IV. 1. 22-24 are relied upon, arrives at the conclusion that the two are separate vratas on the grounds that the two names are different (viz. Janmāstami-vrata and Jayantivrata), their occa sions (nimitta) are different (the first depends only on dark Aṣtami, while the latter exists only if there is Rohiṇi on 8th of dark half of Srāvana) and their characteristics are different in that in Janmāṣtamīvrata sāstra requires only a fast, while in Jayantivrata the śāstra requires a fast and also gifts and the like. Besides, Janmastamivrata is obligatory (nitya), since the texts only speak of the incurring of sin if it be not performed, while Jayantīvrata is both nitya and kūmya in that the śāstras connect it with special rewards in addition to the incurring of sin by its non-observance. Further, the two are separately</p>

<p>Jayanti and Janmāṣtami</p>

<p>mentioned in the same verses.336 Hemādri, Madanaratna, the Nirṇayasindhu (p. 126) and several works hold the view that the two are different. But the N. S. notes 337 that in its day people observed only Janmāstami-vrata and not Jayanti-vrata. On the other hand the Jayantinirṇaya (p. 25) states that people generally celebrate Jayanti only (and not Janmāstami). This variance is probably due to the fact that the two works (N, S. and J. N.) belong to the north and south of India. The Samaya mayūkha 338 and Puruṣārthacintīmaṇi (p. 117 ) very severely criticize the views of Madhava set out above from the Kāla nirṇaya, one of the principal arguments in these last being that the Mimāṁsā rules relied upon by Madhava apply to rites, but Jayanti is the name of a tithi i. e. the 8th of dark half when conjoined to Rohiṇī. The Jayantinirṇaya of Hārīta Venkata nātha holds that the two are different and that both are nitya as well as kāmya (pp. 4-5 and p. 30). It further points out (p. 19) that in Janmāstamīvrata tithi is the principal matter while in Jayanti it is the nakṣatra (Rohiṇi) that is principal.</p>
<p>Two discordant notes are struck by the Varāha-purāna and by the Harivamsa. The former says 339 that Krsna was born on 12th of Aṣāḍha bright half. According to the Harivamsaq. by Hemādri and Jimātavāhana, the naksatra was Abhijit when Krsna was born and the muhūrta was vijaya 340. It is quite</p>

(on काल p. 135), का. वि. p. 494. का. वि. recommends that अभिजित् is to be taken in its root meaning (from जि to conquer) &lsquo;रोहिणीशर्वरीमुहूर्त एव भगवतः कृष्णरूपावतारस्य सकलत्रैलोक्य विजयिनः कारणभावात् तेऽपि जयत्यर्थयोगादभिजिज्जयन्तीविजयनामानो भवन्ति.&rsquo; The verse अभिजि&hellip; जनार्दनः is हरिवंश II (विष्णुपर्व) 4. 16-17.

It will be noted that no month is mentioned in this passage. The verse अभिजिन्नाम occursin वायु 96. 201 also.</p>
<p>134</p>
<p>possible that these two represent some older traditions about the date of the birth of Krsna.</p>
<p>Another important point very much canvassed in the medieval digests is about the exact tithi and time when the Janmāstamīvrata is to be celebrated. The K. N. (pp. 215-224), Kṛtyatattva pp. 438-444, Tithitattva pp. 47-51, Samaya mayūkha p. 50-51, N. S. pp. 128–130 and several other digests state certain conclusions about this.</p>
<p>It is clear from almost all Purāṇas and other works on Janmāstami that the principal time for the celebration of the birth of Krsna is the midnight 341 of the 8th of Srāvana dark half (Bhādrapada dark, if the month is Purnimānta). This tithi is of two kinds viz. (1) without Rohiṇi naksatra and (2) with Rohiṇi naksatra. In each of these two, the Kālanirṇaya of Madhava (pp. 218-224), the Nirṇayasindhu (pp. 128-130 ), the Dharmasindhu (pp. 64-67 ) and other digests set out several possible alternative combinations. The Nirṇayāmsta (pp. 56 58) mentions as many as 18 kinds, eight of the suddhū tithi, 8 of the viddhā tithi and two more, one being the one where Robiṇi. naksatra is there at midnight and the other being Navami joined to Robiṇi and having either Wednesday or Monday. A discussion of these would be somewhat complicated and hardly otherwise than of academical interest to modern readers. There fore, all these alternatives are not set out here. Instead, the brief conclusions put forth by the Tithitattva are given 342 by way of sample. These are: If Jayanti (Aṣtami with Robiṇi) exists only a single day, the fast must be observed on that very day; if it spreads over two days, then the fast is on the later of the two; if there is no Jayanti, then the fast is to be observed on Astami joined with Rohiṇi; if two days have Astami joined to Robiṇi, then fast is on the later of the two; if there is no Rohiṇi nakṣatra then fast is to be observed on the Aṣtami that exists at midnight or if astami exists on two days at midnight or if it be not existent at midnight then on the later day.</p>

<p>If Jayanti fast occurs on Wednesday or Monday there are far greater results and such a fast is superior to crores of other vratas and the man who observes a fast on Jayanti conjoined to Wednesday or Monday would not be born again.343</p>
<p>The main items in Janmāstamīvrata are fast, worship of Krspa, jāgara ( keeping awake at night, listening to and repeat ing hymns of praise and stories about Krsna&rsquo;s exploits), pāraṇā.</p>
<p>The medieval digests such as Tithitattva (pp. 42-47), the Samayamayūkha (pp. 52-57), Kālatattvayivecana (pp. 52-56), Vratarāja (pp. 274–277), Dharmasindhu (pp. 68-69) contain a lengthy procedure of Janmāstamīvrata based principally on Bhavisyottara chap. 55. A brief summary from the first two works (which agree in the main in most respects) is set out below.</p>
<p>On the day of the fast in the morning the devotee should invoke the presence of the Sun, Moon, Yama, Time, the two twilights, the (five) elements, Day and Night, Wind, the lord of the quarters, the earth, the sky, the denizens of aerial regions and gods.344 He should hold in his hand a copper vessel filled with water, some fruits, flowers and whole rice-grains, refer to the month &amp;c. and make a saṅkalpa ‘I shall perform the Krsṇāstami-vrata, for securing a certain reward or for the removal of my sins&rsquo;. He then repeats four mantras addressed to Vāsudeva, one of which is quoted below.345 After repeating the mantras he should dis charge the water in the vessel. He should construct a delivery hall for Devakī having auspicious jars full of water and mango leaves, garlands of flowers, fragrant with burnt aguru and</p>

Then he should keep awake the whole night in listening to the hymns of praise to Krṣṇa, to the stories in the Puranas and in songs, music and dances. Next day after performing all usual acts to be performed in the morning and again offering worship to the image of God Krsna, he should feed brāhmanas and donate to them gold, cow, clothes with the words &lsquo;May Krsna be pleased with me&rsquo;.

<p>Procedure of Janmāṣtami vrata</p>

<p>from Vasudeva for the protection of Vedas spread over the earth. Let there be peace! Let there be bliss! He should then take out the image of Krsna, donate it to a brāhmaṇa and bring the vrata to a close after performing pāraṇā.</p>
<p>The procedure in the Dharmasindhu (pp. 68-69) is more elaborate than the above, though no essential difference exists. It makes use of Vedic mantras (from Rg. X. 90. 1-16) along with Paurāṇika mantras, while in the Samaya-mayukha and Tithi tattva no Vedic mantra is expressly mentioned. As regards jāgara the Dharmasindhu provides that the stories 348 about Krsna may be made striking by reciting poems composed in regional languages, that Vedic hymns may have at their end Paurāṇika stories rocited, that visual representations (such as dances) may be resorted to, that this is a procedure meant for the three higher varṇas, but in the case of śūdras it is not proper to follow the same procedure; they should omit Vedic hymns but may engage in music and Paurāṇika recitations.</p>
<p>One question often raised in some of the medieval digests on Dharmaśāstra is: what is the principal matter in Janmāstaml vrata. Some held that both fast (upavāsa) and worship (pājā) are principal and they rely on a Bhaviṣyapurāṇa 349 passage &lsquo;when at midnight on the 8th of the dark half there is Rohini, worship of Krsna destroys sins committed in three lives; a man observing a fast then and performing worship of Hari does not sink&rsquo;. The Samayamayūkha, after an elaborate discussion in which Mimāṁsā doctrines such as those in Jai. I. 4. 1-3 are employed, arrives at the conclusion that the fast is only an auxiliary (anga), while worship (pūjā) is the principal thing. On the other hand the Tithitattva350 relying on the verse of the</p>

<p>Bhaviṣya opening the description of the vrata &lsquo;On that day one should accept the restrictions of upavāsa&rsquo; and also Mimāmgā doctrines holds that upavāsa is the principal matter and pūjā is an anga (auxiliary matter). The Jayantīnirṇaya contained in the Dasanirṇayi of Hārīta Venkatanātha discusses at length the two (pp. 3 ff). This subject need not be pursued much further.</p>
<p>It has already been stated above that every vrata requires a pāraṇa as the last item, that pārana takes place the day after the day of the fast and that it is generally performed in the morning. There are certain special rules about the pāraṇa of Janmāṣtami fast and Jayanti fast. A few dicta of the purāṇas may be first noted. The Brahmavaivarta 351 states &lsquo;one should never perform pārana while astami tithi is running or Rohini naksatra is still there on the Astami; (if one does so) one destroys what he has done previously and the fruits acquired by the fast. A tithi destroys eight-fold, while a naksatra does so fourfold; therefore one should perform the pārana (of Janmāstami) at the end of the tithi and naksatra&rsquo;. The Nāradapurāṇa 352 remarks when a fast has to be observed on the conjunction of a tithi and nakṣatra, pārapa should not be done until at least one of the two has ended; when a vrata falls on a conjunction (of tithi and nakṣatra), pāraṇa should be done only when one of the two is Beparated (i. e. ends)&rsquo;. The Vahni-purāṇa provides pārana is commended at the end of the nakṣatra or at the end of the tithi&rsquo;. Both the Tithitattva and the Kr̥tyatattva 353 arrive on interpret ing these and other verses at the following conclusions. &lsquo;Pāraṇa is to be observed on the day after the fast, but after the end of the tithi (astami) and the naksatra (Rohini); but when one of</p>

<p>Pārana of Janmūstami fast</p>
<p>139</p>
<p>the two ends before mahāniśā and the other during mahānisā or after it, pāraṇa should be observed at the end of one of the two; when both exist during the period of mahāniśā then one should perform pārana in the morning at the end of the festival&rsquo;. At the end of the pārana the performer repeats the mantra &lsquo;salutations to Govinda, who is Being, who is the ruler of (all) beings, who is the lord of (all) beings and who is the source of all beings&rsquo;.354 The above statement shows that in certain cases the pārana of Janmāstamivrata may be at night,355 particularly for vaiṣṇavas who perform the vrata ag a duty and not for any reward.</p>
<p>There is a difference of meaning between udyāpana and pārana. Some vratas like Ekādaśī and Janmāstams are per formed throughout a man&rsquo;s life; in such cases there is only pārapa after the fast on every occasion that a fast is observed. If a man undertakes a vrata only once and finishes it, then the concluding rites of the vrata are called udyāpana.</p>
<p>Besides the items mentioned above, it is the practice, parti cularly of boys and common people in Mahārāṣṭra, to hang up pots full of curds and buttermilk on the day after the birth of Krspa is celebrated, to play underneath the pot, sing songs and then pierce the pot and get drenched by curds and buttermilk running out from the holes made. This is probably due to the legends associated with Krsna&rsquo;s boyhood among cowherds. The Bhāgavata 356 expressly says that the cowherds sprinkled each other on Kssna&rsquo;s birth with curds, milk, ghee, and smeared each other with these. This is called &lsquo;Gopālakālā in Mahārāstra. But this is not observed in other parts of India such as Saurastra. Surprisingly enough the Krspajanmāstaml festival does not, like the Rāmanavami festival, figure in the Kṛtya kalpataru on vrata. One cannot account for this omission.</p>

<p>But in the Naiyatakāla section 357 of the same work, a brief procedure of Krsnajanmāstami (which is word for word the same in the Kr̥tyaratnākara) different from the one specified above from the Tithitattva and other works, is set out. It is as follows: On the 8th of the dark half of Bhadrapada was born in Kaliyuga in the 28th (kalpa?), Krsna, son of Devaki, for removing the burden (of the earth) and the reduction of ksatriyas. He (his image) should therefore be worshipped on that day, as also (of) Devaki and Yasodā with sandalwood paste, flowers, incense, various fruits and foods and dishes prepared from barley and wheat together with cow&rsquo;s milk. At night the devotee should keep awake with songs and dances. Then on the 9th about the time of arunodaya (4 ghaṭikās before sunrise ) women dressed in red clothes and decked with garlands of flowers should carry the images of these (Krsna, Devakī and Yaśodā) to a holy river bank or to a charming and unfrequented lake, wherein they should themselves take their bath and also bathe the images; then returning home they should eat a meal of barley together with jaggery, honey, ghee and black pepper.</p>
<p>Before closing this account of Janmāstami reference must be made to a paper read in 1867 before the Berlin Akademie der Wissenschaften by the renowned German scholar, Prof. A. Weber. The subject of the paper was &lsquo;An investigation into the origin of the festival of Krsnajanmāstami&rsquo; and the paper was divided into four parts; the first dealt with the sources (an English translation of it by E. Rehatsek was published in Indian Antiquary vol. VI. pp. 161-180 and pp. 281-301 ), the 2nd dealt with ritual, the 3rd part was the most important and was con cerned with a novel theory, viz. the ritual of Krṣnāstami festival was something transferred from outside of India, that the description in the ritual of Krsna&rsquo;s image as suckling at the mother&rsquo;s (Devaki&rsquo;s) breast was the keystone of the theory of this ritual as of foreign origin and that it was suggested by pictorial representations of the Madonna with a suckling child (Christ)</p>

<p>Weber&rsquo;s theory about Janmāṣtami</p>
<p>141</p>
<p>&amp;c. An English translation of this part appeared in Indian Antiquary, vol. III. pp. 21-25 and pp. 47–52. This paper, though it is a monument of learning and patient industry (for that period when very few Sanskrit books had been printed ), gave rise to severe criticism owing to its fantastic and perverse conclusion about Krsnajanmāstami ritual being borrowed from Christian representations of Christ and his mother Mary. In I. A, vol. III. p. 300 Growse attacked it very severely. In spite of all criticisms the tenacious German scholar stuck to his guns and launched an attack against his critics, particularly against Dr. Rajendralal Mitra, in I. A. vol. IX. pp. 226-229. As hardly any Sanskrit scholar in these days would espouse the theory put forward by Weber, I do not think that I should waste much time over a refutation thereof. Most European scholars, nurtured on the vaunted intellectual eminence of the ancient Greeks and on the intolerant attitude of christianity towards other faiths, when they became acquainted with things Indian and studied Sanskrit, were obsessed (though not very obviously expressed) by two notions, viz. much in India that resembled what prevailed in the West must have been borrowed from the West and further, that Indians, who had allowed themselves to be invaded by outsiders and governed by foreigners for centuries, must not have been good at anything. These two notions gave rise to many untenable theories such as the following: the Rāmāyana was borrowed from Homer&rsquo;s Iliad, the art of writing was un known to Pāṇini, the Brāhmi script was based on Phoenician or Aramaic script, that the Gītā was based on the Bible, that the very ancient Indian naksatra system was borrowed either from the Chinese, the Babylonians or Arabs. Most of such theories were the result of little knowledge and the non-recognition of certain common sense rules and have now been consigned to the limbo of deserved oblivion. The common sense rule is that when a thing or a state of things has existed for centuries in a certain country or among a certain people, the burden of proving that it was borrowed by that country or people from outside is very heavy on those who assert such borrowing; mere similarities can never he held to amount to any evidence of borrowing at all; scholars should be very chary of confidently asserting borrowing and should put forward their conclusions very cauti ously. It would not be irrelevant to point out the main circum stances on which Weber, often a champion of lost causes, relied for his theory.</p>
<p>142</p>
<p>The first is that in the ritual of Krspāstami contained in some digests (that said that they borrowed the passage from Bhavisyottara) the image of Krsna was to be shown 358 as suckl. ing at the breast of Devaki, that this is a unique direction, that in the Ramanavami festival which is similar to Janmāstami the image of Rāma is not required to be suckling at the breast of Kausalyā, that this detail was copied from the representation of the Madonna Lactans. Weber relied (vide I. A. vol. III p. 51 ) on ono De Bossi who said that pictures of infant Christ at the breast existed in 2nd century A. D. Weber brushed aside the testimony of other scholars that the Madonna with the child was a subject little known to the early christian centuries and the opinion of other scholars that the representations of the Madonna Lactang are extremely rare in Byzantine and Russian art (I. A. vol. III p. 48) and almost always of very late date. Weber makog a mountain of a molehill. The image of Rāma is also described as lying on the lap of the mother Kausalyā.359 Further, all purāṇas do not provide that the image of Kyspa was to be suckling at the breast. Hemādri, in describing the Jayantivrata from the Purāṇas, shows that the image was to be on the lap of the mother Devaki.360 Was the Hindu imagination so poor that when they could describe the image of Rāma or Krsna as lying on the mother&rsquo;s lap they could not also imagine that it could be shown as suckling at the breast and had to run to the West to copy that detail from representations of the Madonna and the child thousands of miles away?</p>
<p>The 2nd point made much of by Weber was that Nārada is represented as having brought from Sveta-dvipa ( white land) the doctrine of salvation by faith. Weber holds that Svetadvipa was Alexandria, while Lassen holds that it was Parthia. If we read the description of Svetadvipa in the śāntiparva ( chapters</p>

<p>Weber&rsquo;s theory about Janmāṣtami</p>
<p>143</p>
<p>336-339 ) and in such Purāṇas 361 as Vāmana (chap. 25.16 and 60. 56) and Kūrma (I. 49) it would be clear that Svetadvipa was an imaginary or mythical place where everything was white, where Viṣṇu and the gods dwelt and that it had no earthly existence at least in the minds of the authors who wrote the above works.</p>
<p>The third important point according to Weber was that certain incidents in Krsna&rsquo;s life such as Kāliya-mardana are similar to those in Christianity. Weber himself says that victory over Kāliya is a travesty of the christian tradition of the serpent. It appears to me that there is nothing common between the two except the word serpent.</p>
