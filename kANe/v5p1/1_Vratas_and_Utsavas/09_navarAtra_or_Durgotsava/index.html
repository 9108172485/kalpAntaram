  <p>CHAPTER IX</p>
<p>Navaratra or Durgotsava</p>
<p>From the 1st of Āśvina bright half to the 9th is celebrated the Durgāpājā festival, otherwise called Navarātra, observed all over India in some form or other. Some of the works 390 provide that Durgotsava must be celebrated in both Sarad (Āśvina-śukla) and Vasanta (in Caitra-śukla). But it is the Durgotsava39 of Āśvina that is celebrated in a grand style, particularly in Bengal, Bihar and Kāmarūpa.</p>
<p>If a person is unable to celebrate the festival392 for nine days, he should do so for three days beginning from the 7th tithi of Asvina-sukla. In fact, the Tithitattva 393 puts forward several alternative periods for Durgāpuja as follows: (1) from the 9th tithi of the preceding dark half of Pūrnimānta Āśvina to the 9th tithi of Asvina-sukla; (2) from the first tithi of Asvina śukla to 9th; (3) from the 6th to the 9th; (4) from the 7th to the 9th; (5) from the Mahastami to the 9th, (6) only on the Mahāstaml; (7) only on the Mahānavami. Most of these alternatives find support in the Kālikā and other Purāṇas.</p>

<p>There is a voluminous literature on Durgotsava. Every digest on vratas, tithis and pūjā devotes considerable space to this subject. Moreover, there are special treatises on Durgotsava or Navarātra, such as the Durgotsavaviveka of Sūlapāṇi, the Durgāpūjā-prayogatattva (published by the Sanskrit Sābity Parishad, 1924) of which the Durgārcanapaddhati of Raghu nandana (published by Jivananda, vol. II) is a part, Durgābhakti tarangipi of Vidyāpati,394 the Navarātra-pradipa of Vināyaka alias Nanda-pandita, the Durgotsavapaddhati by Udayasimha (2nd half of 15th century A. D. ).395 Besides these, the Mārkandeyapurāpa (chapters 78-90 in Venk. Press ed. and 81-93 in Banerji&rsquo;s) contains what is called Devīmāhātmya 3% (or Saptaśati or Candi) in which are described the appearance of Devi from the accumulated tejas of Viṣṇu, Śhaṅkara, Agni and other gods, her getting different weapons from the several gods such as the trident from Śiva, discus from Viṣṇu, Vajra from Indra, her victory over and slaughter of the</p>

<p>great demon Mahisāsura, and of the demons Canda and Munda, Sumbha and Niśumbha. The Kālikāpurāna, the Brhan-nandiko śvara-purāṇa397 and the Devipurāna also devote considerable space to Durgā and her pūjā. I have used, though not much, the English work on Durgā-pūjā by Pratapachandra Ghosh published so far back as 1871. My endeavour will be to give as briefly as possible an account of all the salient features of this great reli gious worship and festival from the Sanskrit texts themselves.</p>
<p>This pūjā is nitya as well as kāmya ;398 it is the first because the Kālikāpurāna (63. 12–13) prescribes that whoever, through laziness, hypocrisy, hatred or stupidity, does not celebrate the great festival of Durgā has all his desires frustrated by the angry Deyi; it is also kāmya because rewards are promised when one celebrates Durgotsava &lsquo;all should always perform the worship of Davi in order to secure incomparable eminence which confers the purusārthas, viz. Dharma, Artha, Kāma and Moksa&rsquo; and &lsquo;one should worship Bhavāni for pleasing her, for happiness in that year, for the destruction of evil spirits and goblins and for delight&rsquo; (Tithitattva p. 65). The original purposes and objects of this festival were high and noble as stated in the Devi purāna 399 &ldquo;This is a great and holy vrata conferring great siddhis, vanquishing all enemies, conferring benefits on all people, especially in great floods; this should be performed by brāhmapas for solemn sacrifices and by ksatriyas for the protection of the people, by vaiśyas for cattle wealth, by śūdras desirous of sons and happiness, by women for blessed wifehood and by rich men who hanker for more wealth; this was performed by Śhaṅkara and others&rdquo;. But in course of time, the objects were brought down to the ordinary level as stated in the Devimāhātmya 400 &lsquo;by listening</p>

<p>with devotion to my greatness in the great annual pūjā per formed in autumn, a man becomes free from all troubles and becomes endowed with wealth and agricultural produce by my favour&rsquo;. The exaggerated importance of this Durgā-pūjā will be clear from one verse of the Bhaviṣya &lsquo;rites like Agnihotra, solemn sacrifices described in the Vedas and completed with daksiṇā are not equal oven to one hundred-thousandth part of the worship of Candika.&lsquo;401</p>
<p>This Durgāpājā is very cosmopolitan in character. It could be performed not only by persons belonging to the four varṇas, but even by those who were outside the pale of the caste system, Durgā-pājā has a congregational character and is not purely religious, but has also a social element in it (such as inviting friends and treating them &amp;c.). The Bhaviṣyapurana 402 says &lsquo;Devi should be worshipped (in her shrine) on Vindhya</p>
<p>mountain, in all places, cities, houses, villages and forests by brāhmaṇas, ksatriyas, kings, vaisyas, sūdras, who are full of devotion, who have taken a bath and who are cheerful and jolly, by mlecchas and other men (such as pratilomas) and by women&rsquo;. In another place the Bhaviṣya states 403 Durgā is worshipped by various groups of mlecchas, by all dasyus (thievish tribes or outcaste Hindus), by people from Anga, Vanga and Kalinga, by kinnaras, Barbaras (non-Aryans) and Sakas&rsquo;. Later medieval writers were careful to point out that mlecchas bad no adhikūra to perform japa or homa or pūjā with mantras through a brāhmaṇa as sūdras had, but they could only mentally resolve to offer in honour of Devi animals as offerings and wine 104 also and do so.</p>

<p>It is stated in the Skanda and Bhaviṣya 405 purānas that the worship of Candikā in autumn (Aśvina) is of a threefold character; viz. sāttviki, rājasi and tāması; the sāttviki worship is effected by japa, by offering naivedya in which there is no meat; and japa consists in reciting the texts of the purānas in which the greatness of Devi is described; rājass worship is effected by offering a bali and with naivedya which contains flesh; that is tāmasi worship which is effected by the offerings of wine and meat and from which japa is absent and which is without mantras; this last is approved among Kiratas (i. e. forest tribes and the like). Raghunandana adds 406 in his Prāyascitta tattva that the offering of wine in Durgāpūjā relates to ages other than the Kali age (i. e. other than the present age).</p>
<p>It has been stated above (pp.110-111, n. 280) that the principal gods are deemed to go to sleep for four months on different tithis from the prati pad (1st) of Āṣāḍha-sukla to the 15th. Therein Durgā is said to go to sleep on the 8th of the bright half of Āṣāḍha. Therefore, in Āśvina she would be asleep. Hence the texts provide for the rousing (bodhana) of Devi from sleep. As usual there are conflicting views. The Tithitattva 407 notices the views of some that if the Devi is to be worshipped as having 18 arms she was to be roused on the 9th of the dark half preceding Aśvina bright half, but that if she was to be worshipped as possessing ten arms then the bodhana was to be on the 6th (of the bright half of Aśvina). Raghunandana does not accept this and holds that the bodhana of Dovī with ton arms was to be either on the 9th (of the preceding dark half) or on the 6th (of the bright half of Asvina). If the performer begins on the 9th of the dark half the saṅkalpa will be as noted below.408 He may, however, begin on the first</p>

If he has already started the utsava on pratipad, then he should go near a bilva tree in the evening conjoint with Jyesthā or without it (and even if ṣasthi has expired before evening, then in the evening without sasthi) and rouse Devī with the mantra 413 ‘for the destruction of Rāvana and in order to favour Rāma, Brahmā, O goddess, in former times roused you at an unusual time; therefore, I also awaken you in the evening of the 6th tithi of Aśvina.&rsquo; After thus awakening Devi he should invite the bilva treo with the words &ldquo;O bilva tree! born on the top of Srisaila and the abode of Lakṣmi, I have to take you; come, you are to be worshipped as Durgā.&rsquo; Then he should, after taking each of the substances mentioned below and accompanying each with a mantra, place them on the bilva tree and make it an auspicious dwelling place for Durgā. The substances for making a holy 414 residence for Devi are; earth or clay, sandalwood paste, pebbles, coriander, dūryā grass, flowers, fruits, curds, ghee, svastika, vermilion, conch-shell, collyrium, rocana.

Then he should repair to the pandal erected for Durgā. pājā, perform ācamana, should bind together with Aparājita creeper twigs or leaves of nine plants 415 so as to form one bundle or sheaf, viz. plantain, pomegranate, coriander, turmeric, Arum Indicum, Arum colocacia, bilva, aśoka and jayanti. Each of these substances is accompanied by an appropriate separate mantra.</p>
<p>He should offer worship to the bundle of nine plants and to the image (of Durgā) and make the Devi abide in the bilva tree with sandalwood (and other substances mentioned above). The rousing (bodhana) of the Devi and the invitation to the bilva tree are separate and are done with separate mantras (Tithitattva pp. 75-76). The two may be done at the same time if 6th tithi exists in the evening; but if it does not exist in the evening then bodhana may be done on the 6th and invitation on the 7th or bodhana may be done in the morning and invita tion in the evening. The clay image of Durgā together with the twig of bilva is to be entered in the house and worshipped. The details of the complicated discussion are not set out here.</p>

He then establishes the bundle of (the leaves and twigs) of nine plants tied together with Aparājitā creeper and the bilva branch. He worships the latter with &lsquo;salutation to the bilva branch&rsquo; and honours Cāmundā on the bilva branch and the clay image with the words &rsquo;this is pādya (water for washing the feet), salutation to Cāmupdā&rsquo; and addresses the bilva branch with the mantra quoted in n. 413 above. Then he utters the mantra &lsquo;O Cāmundā&rsquo;l move, move, make others move, enter my house quickly and go to the place of worship, svāhā&rsquo;. Then he establishes the ghata, worships the nine plants and five devatās, establishes the image on a seat and the bundle of nine plants to its right to the accompaniment of songs and instrumental music and places the bilva branch in a copper vessel near the (image of) Devi and performs the prana pratisthā 417 (vivifying or endowing with life) of the image of the Devi and of Ganeśa and other deities in the manner provided in the Durgārcanapaddhati (p. 666) and Tithitattva (pp. 77-78).

<p>Much has been written about the sacrifice of animals in Durgāpūjā. Only a few points can be dealt with here.

<p>of her own sex, The bali should have no defect and should not be one whose tail or ears were cut off. Though the above list of victims that may be offered is long, usually only goats and he-buffaloes were sacrificed. It is said 423 &rsquo;the Devi that resides on Vindhya is not so well pleased with the offerings of flowers, incense, and unguents and of other animals as she is pleased with offerings of rams and he-buffaloes&rsquo;. The Varsa-kriya kaumudi 424 quotes &ldquo;one should never offer to the great Devi a horse or elephant; if a brāhmaṇa offers a lion, a tiger or a human being (as balı) he would go to hell and even in this world he would have a short life and would be devoid of happiness and prosperity; if (a brahmana) offers his own blood, he would be guilty of suicide. If a brāhmaṇa offered wine he would lose his status as a brāhmaṇa. When wine is laid down as a necessary offering he should offer cocoanut water in a vessel of bell-metal or honey in a copper vessel.&rdquo; But there were texts that contradict this. For example, it is said in the Kalikapurana goat, he-buffalo, human being are declared to be bali, mahābali and atibali, respectively.&rsquo; 425 It has to be remembered that though an animal is killed still what is offered to the Devi is generally blood and the head of the victim. The Kālikāpurāṇa 426 says &lsquo;blood purified by the recitation of mantras over it and the head (of a victim) are said to be nectar; in the worship (of Devi) the adept worshipper</p>

<p>should offer flesh rarely (if at all) except blood and the head, which (two) become nectar.&rdquo; The Kālikāpurāna further states that Śiva (Durgā) partakes of the head as well as the flesh of the victim, that one should offer in pūjā the blood and head of the victim, but the wise ( devotee ) should employ flesh in edibles and in homa. The Durgārcanapaddhati (pp. 669-671) prescribes an elaborate ritual about killing the bali and offering its blood and head and the rites and mantras slightly differ according as the bali is a goat, a buffalo or the performer&rsquo;s own blood. The 427 bali is made to face the east, the sādhaka (devotee) faces the north and repeats certain mantras one of which is Vāj. S. 23. 17 &lsquo;Agni was the animal to be sacrificed. They sacrificed with him, he conquered this world (the earth) on which Agni exists; that will be your world, you will conquer that world, drink this water. Vāyu (wind God) was the animal &amp;c.; the Sun was the animal &amp;c.&rsquo; Another mantra is Manu V.39 (=Viṣṇu dharmasūtra 51. 61-Kālikā 71.39) viz. &lsquo;animals were created by Brahmā himself for serving the purpose of sacrifice, for the well-being of sacrifice and of all; therefore killing (an animal) in a sacrifice is no killing (does not cause the sin or blame of ordinary killing )&rsquo;. He should place on the head of the bali a flower with a mantra; tion he sprinkles water with kuśas over the bali and then worships the sword with the mantra &ldquo;you are the tongue of Candikā and you accomplish heaven (for the worshipper); Hrīm, Srim, O sword l&rsquo;. The performer contemplates on the sword as described in Tithitattva (p. 81) and Durgārcana paddhati (p. 670), honours it with sandalwood paste and the rest and repeats eight names of the gword, bows to it, takes it up with the words * Ām, Hrīm, Phat&rsquo; and with one stroke cuts off the victim facing the east ( while the performer faces the north ) or facing the north (while the performer faces the east). Then he collects blood in a vessel of clay or other material, places it before the Devi and offers it with the words &rsquo;this is the blood of the goat; Om, O Jayanti!&rsquo; and says &lsquo;Aim, Hrim, Srim, O Kausiki! May she be pleased by the blood.&rsquo; Then he offers the head of the bali (goat or the like) placing on the head a lamp with a flaming wick. He then takes blood from the sword (with</p>

<p>which the animal&rsquo;s neck was cut) and makes a tilaka mark with it on his forehead with two mantras. It was supposed that the tilaka of blood would make all persons amenable to the person who had that blood mark on the forehead as the mantra quoted below expresses. When the bali is a buffalo, the mantras repeated over a goat are omitted and two others are substituted viz. &lsquo;as you hate a horse and as you carry Candikā, so kill my enemies and bring happiness, O buffalo; you are the vehicle of Yama, you possess excellent form, you who are deathless; bestow on me long life, wealth, fame, a bow to you who are a buffalo&rsquo;. The fruit of offering buffalo&rsquo;s blood to Devi was deemed to be her gratification and favour for a hundred years. Then he performs japa of a mantra (quoted in note )428 and also certain verses of laudation and asks for certain benefits (Durgārcana. p. 672).929</p>
<p>The Kālikāpurāna in a long passage 430 provides gradually rising periods of times for which Durgā becomes gratified by the offering of the blood of various animals. A few might be cited here: Durgā secures satisfaction for one month by the (offering of the) blood of fishes and tortoises, and for two months by (the blood of) crocodiles; by the blood of the black antelope and of the boar Devi is pleased for twelve years and by the blood of buffalo and rhinoceros for a hundred years; by the blood of the lion, the śarabha and from the performer&rsquo;s body Devi is gratified for a thousand years and hy a human being as a bali for a thousand years.&rdquo; There was a revulsion cf fealing against blood sacrifices in some hearts and so even the Kālikā provides 431 that the offerings of kūṣmāṇda (pumpkin-gourd) and sugarcane stalks, intoxicants and āsavas (spirits distilled from molasses, flowers or herbs) are like (animal) victims and gratification</p>

<p>(to the Devi) is the same as by the offering of a goat. But even in these days castes deemed higher, even including brāhmaṇas, offer goats and rarely buffaloes to Durgā, if that is the custom of the caste or family. I understand that many families of learned brāhmaṇas such as the Bhattācāryas of Bhatpara in West Bengal sacrifice fruits and vegetables in lieu of animals. The Ahalyākāma-dhenu 432 says that some Vaiṣṇavas regard the night when victims are killed as horrible and do not eat food or even drink water on that night and that among brāhmana castes the offering (bali) should be in the form of kūsmānda and the like or flour images of animals or simple ghee should be offered. As to other castes also it has been declared that Kūṣmānda, bilva fruit, sugarcane stalks may be cut into pieces.</p>
<p>The convenient belief from very ancient times has been that a victim offered in sacrifice to gods and pitrs went to heaven. Rg. I. 162.21433 = Vāj. S. 23. 16 ) and Manu V. 42 say 80. Hemādri quotes verses saying that all the animals such as the buffalo that are employed for (gratifying) Devi go to heaven and those that kill them incur no sin.134</p>
<p>The foregoing is somewhat of a digression, as the bali is generally to be sacrificed on the 9th and as the rites of even of the 8th have not yet been described. On the Mahāstami con joined to Pūrvāsādhā-naksatra or without it, the devotee after taking a bath and sipping water, should face the east or north, sit on a seat of darbhas, perform purification of himself and the body which is made up of five elements by repeating separately the mystic letters &lsquo;yam, ram, lam, vam&rsquo; in the manner set out on p. 673 of Durgārcanapaddhati; then he performs prānāyāma, and then nyūsa on the several parts of the body from the heart and head to the feet. He sprinkles over himself and the materials of worship water contained in a vessel of conch-shell</p>

<p>and the like and over which he mutters eight times the mantra &lsquo;Hrim, Om Durgāyai namah&rsquo;, he contemplates on Durgā as described on p. 163 and note 418 above, places a flower on his head, mentally offers upacāras (to Devi), again contemplates on Devi&rsquo;s form and then offers the upacāras from āsana (seat) to praṇāma (as indicated in note 420 above) with appropriate brief mantras. Then he offers worship to several goddesses to the right side, front side and left side of Devi with brief mantras and to the Mātrs435 (64 are enumerated in Durgārcanao. pp. 676 677, or 32, or 16 or 8) according to one&rsquo;s ability with five upacāras or with sandalwood paste and flowers and to the eight mātrs Brahmāni &amp;c. Then there is angapūjā (worship of Devi&rsquo;s limbs) from heart and head to the feet. Then worship is offered to her weapons such as trident, sword, discus, sharp arrow, shield, fully strung bow, the noose, goad, bell; and then her lion-seat is honoured and also armour, whisk, umbrella, flag and flag-staff, drum, conch. Separate mantras are recited in connection with the pūjā of each of these, as laid down in Durgārcanapaddhati pp. 678-681, in the Nirṇayasindhu pp. 179-181 (which quotes them from Viṣṇudharmottara) and other works. They are all passed over here for saving space. Then he goes near the sheaf of nine plants and worships it with five upacāras or with sandal wood paste and flowers offered to each separately. Then he makes an offering of mūṣa pulse and boiled rice.</p>
<p>On the day on which there is Mahāstamipūjā the performer observes a fast. But a householder 436 who has a son should not observe a fast on the Maltāstami. He should follow one of the alternatives specified above in note 252 (naktam havisyānnam &amp;c). Whatever procedure about food he may follow, he, keeping himself pure and observing the rules of conduct for vrata, should worship Devi; he should offer worship on the Mahāṣtami and on the 9th with balıs; he should take leave (of Devi) on the 10th with</p>

<p>Śravana-nakṣatra after performing the Sābara festival. When the last quarter of Sravana (naksatra) is running then he should give a send-off to Devi on the 10th tithi. The Tithitattva 437 positively asserts that a fast is to be observed on the same day on which Mahāstami-pājā is performed.</p>
<p>On this 8th tithi the performer has to honour maidens, food them and brāhmaṇas also. He may honour a maiden or maidens from the first to the 9th tithi, but he must do so at least on 8th. The Devipurāṇa 438 says &ldquo;Durgā is not so much gratified by homa, gifts and japa as she is gratified (becomes favourable) by honouring maidens.&rdquo; And he has to give them dakṣiṇā also. Hemādri (on vrata vol. I. 903-906) quotes a long passage from the Skanda-purāṇa on this subject. Skanda provides that the performer should feed maidens from the first tithi of Navarātra on a rising scale, viz. one maiden on the first tithi, two on the 2nd and so on up to nine on the 9th. If he feeds nine virgins every day (of the Navarātra) he secures land; if he feeds double the number on each succeeding day he gets prosperity. He should not honour a maiden who is one year old (or less), for, such a girl has not developed at that age liking for fruits, flowers and sandal wood paste. Therefore, he should honour maidens who are from two to ten years old, and not those that are beyond ten years. The Devipurāṇa provides that if no virgin is available, one may honour even a married girl who has had no menstruation.439 The Skanda provides that maidens from two years to ton should be honoured under the following names respectively, viz. Kumārika (two years old), Trimūrti (three years old), Kalyāṇi, Rohips, Kāli, Candikā, Sambhavi, Durgā, Subhadra. The Skanda provides special pūjā mantras for each of the nine kinds of maidens and different rewards are provided for honouring each of the nine classes. These are passed over here.

<p>taken a ceremonial bath with oil is noted below.440 In this way he is to honour virgins with bodice, clothes, sandalwood paste, flowers and akṣatas, with different kinds of edibles and dishon and feed them with pūyasa (rice boiled in milk and sugar). One should not honour a maiden that has a limb more or less, that suffers from leprosy, or that has varicose veins or has a broken head or has limbs from which blood or pus oozes or has ulcers, that is blind from birth, is squint-eyed or blind of one eye or is ugly or has little hair or much hair or is diseased or is born of a slave woman. A man should honour a brāhmaṇa maiden in all acts, a ksatriya maiden for victory, one belonging to untouch able castes in acts of terrible nature. After the maidens are fed, brāhmaṇas also should be fed (Durgārcana. pp. 681),</p>
<p>The Tithitattva (pp. 69-72), Nirṇayasindhu and other works provide that in the Navaratra the performer should hear the recitation of the Vedas (Vedapārāyaṇa) and that beginning with the first tithi up to the 9th he should himself mutter Cardipātha (recitation of Devimāhātmya) or engage a person to do so, reciting it once on the first, twice on 2nd tithi and so on up to nine times on 9th tithi. The Devipurāṇa provides for pūjā, japa and homa and the mantras therefore by saying that the worship of Devi is to be performed by casting into the fire sesame and with curds, milk and ghee. The Dovi mantra is either what is called the Jayantimantra441 (quoted in note ) or the mantra of nine syllables ( quoted in the note). The Dvaitanirṇaya-siddhāntasangraha states that the mantra ia either one that a man&rsquo;s guru has taught him, or the Vedic verse &lsquo;Jātayedase sunavāma&rsquo;(Rg. I. 99.1) or one with nine letters or the one &rsquo;namo dovyai mahādevyai&rsquo; or the slokas in the Saptaśatī.442 The Tithitattva quotes (pp. 69–71) a long passage</p>

<p>from the Vārāhi-tantra about the result of reciting Devimāhātmya several times. A few verses are cited for sample. “When some great danger threatens, one should recite (Devimāhātmya) seven times; if repeated twelve times one secures fulfilment of one&rsquo;s desires and the destruction of enmity; if repeated 14 times, an enemy would be subdued and a woman would be brought under one&rsquo;s control; repeating a hundred times results in increase of one&rsquo;s kingdom; if repeated a thousand times Lakṣmi comes to a man of her own accord. As Aśvamedha is the prince among sacrifices, as Hari (is superior) among gods, so the laud called Saptaśati is the highest among all lauds.443&rdquo; The Tithitattva further provides that one should recite444 before the reading of the &lsquo;prathamacarita&rsquo; the rṣi (sage), the metre &amp;c. of it and also when repeating the Madhyamacarita and the Utlaracarita. Very great importance was attached in ancient and medieval times to the recitation of mantras and even modern men brought up in English&rsquo;schools, colleges and Universities often implicitly believe in their efficacy, even if one may not understand their meaning. The qualities of the sounds of mantras or of parts of mantrag ( such as ‘hrim&rsquo;) and their potentialities, the various devices employed when using them are deemed of far greater importance than the meaning. The Gītā (X. 25) itself puts Japa-yajña as the highest among yajñas such as those of dravya (materials or money), tapoyajña (Gītā IV. 28). Mantras are supposed to have B tremendous effect on the sub-conscious mind and it may perhaps bo so if one concentrates one&rsquo;s mind thereon to the exclusion of all else. A person could himself recite the Saptaśatī or engage a porson to read it to him who was called yāthaka or tācaka as in T. T. p. 72, Durgārcana. p. 661. Some very orthodox writers went 30 far as to lay down that a sūdra could only listen to the Mahābharata or Saptasati but could not read it himself.

<p>should stop reading at the end of a chapter and not in its middle; but if for some reason one had to stop in the middle of a chapter, when one again commenced reading or reciting Saptaśati, one should not proceed from where one left off in the middle of a chapter, but begin with the first verse of the chapter half read or recited. Provision was made that the reader engaged for reading Saptaśati should be handsomely requited for his labour hy gifts of gold, silver, cows with bell-metal pails for milking. Mr Ghosh notes (p. 39) that besides the reader of Devimāhātmya a separate priest is selected to repeat the mūlamantra a hundred thousand times and is called Jāpaka. The Nirṇayasindhu (pp. 185–186) gives elaborate descriptions of Satacandi-patha and Sahasracandi. In the first, ten well-conducted brāhmaṇas including the ūcārya are chosen. They are to recite together Saptaśati once on the 1st day, twice on the 2nd, thrice on the 3rd and four times on the 4th; in this way Saptaśati would be repeated one hundred times. In Sahasracaṇdi one hundred brāhmaṇas are to be chosen and they are to repeat Saptaśati for four days as in Satacandi-pātha. A thousand brāhmaṇas are to be fed and one hundred cows are to be donated. The Nirṇayasindhu notes that these two are not included in the great digests but there is popular usage to this effect.</p>
<p>After each pūjā prescribed for the day, the family memberg, their friends and guests sit together and partake of the prasāda (which in the houses of the well-to-do comprises select delicacies).</p>
<p>Formerly, the persons sitting together would have sometimes - numbered hundreds, but in the days of rationing and control, this would not happen. Mukerji (p. 124) notes that guests made offerings to the goddess (usually cash which belongs to the owner and not to the priest.)</p>
<p>After the pūjā, homa is performed as indicated above; offerings are to be made in fire called &lsquo;Balada &lsquo;446 with the word</p>
<p>svāhā&rsquo; at the end to the accompaniment of a mantra preceded by &lsquo;om&rsquo;. The Durgārcana-paddhati notes (p. 681 ) that after the special rites on the Mahāstami described above (viz. pūjā, honouring maidens, homa &amp;c.) are finished the rest of the tithi should be spent by the devotee in dance, song3447 and musio</p>

<p>(jāgara ). It appears that in the Devi and Kālikā purānas it is provided that even on the 8th at midnight an animal such as a goat or he-buffalo should be sacrificed and that on the 9th tithi many balis were to be sacrificed. When the Sun is in the sign of Kanya (Virgin or Virgo) and in the month of Isa (Āśvina ) one should offer pūjā on the 9th tithi of the bright half; one should observe a fast (on that tithi) and at midnight should begin pūjā of Devi with great expenditure and parapher nalia when the naksatra is Mūla or Purvāsādhā; an animal should be killed and a he-buffalo and a goat should be sacrificed&rsquo;.448</p>
<p>A short period of time, viz. the last ghaṭikā 449 of Mahāstami and the first ghaṭika of navami, was called &lsquo;sandhi&rsquo;. During that period of two ghaṭikās a pūjā of Devi together with Yoginis is to be performed which is deemed to be the holiest pūjā (Ghosh p. 120). This puja is to be performed like the puja on Mahāstami, but the bali is to be offered at and after the Maha navami begins 450 and not during the last ghaṭikā of Mahāstami.</p>
<p>Now the rites of the Mahānavami have to be described. On the 9th tithi conjoined to Uttarāsādhā nakṣatra or without it, pājā is to be performed on the lines of the one of Mahastami. This day&rsquo;s puja is 451 only a repetition of that on the 8th, the</p>

<p>only difference being that a larger number of balis (goats etc.) may be sacrificed on it than on the 8th tithi. A bali is to be offered as it is obligatory to do so on the 9th.52 Then the wor shipper should perform homa, if able to do so. If he be unable to perform homa on both days, he should perform it on Mahāstami. The offerings in the fire are to be 108. If a person cannot perform a homa in person he should choose a brāhmaṇa to do it, while a śūdra must always get the homa performed through a brahmana. Lamps should be waved before the Devi (nirajana)52a from her head down to her feet. Dakṣiṇā (fee) to the priest for the whole of the autumnal pūjā is to be given on the 9th tithi and Raghunandana expressly 453 says that the Durgā-bhakti tarangini is wrong in saying that daksiṇā is to be paid after taking leave (visarjana) of Devl.

He should feed brahmanas. It is the practice in many families to embrace each other and sing the praise of Durgā while drums are beaten.

<p>procession visits other houses and the parties return the visits to each other by turns and wish happiness and good luck to each other and offer sweets. Rājanītiprakāśa (pp. 439–444) quotes a long passage from the Devi-purāṇa about the worship of Devi on 9th of Asv. śu.</p>
<p>On the 10th tithi after bathing and sipping water he should offer worship with sixteen upacāras or with as many as possible, should praise Devi with these words &lsquo;Om Durgām Śivām&rsquo; &amp;c. (on p. 672 of Durgārcanapaddhati), should prostrate himself before her and make request to Devi with the mantra &lsquo;Mahiṣaghni mahāmāye &amp;o.&rsquo; (ibid. p. 672) and with the verse quoted 454 a below take a flower and cast it on the image with the words &lsquo;forgive&rsquo;. Then after repeating two verses he should raise the image (of Devi), the bilva twig and the sheaf of nine plants from their places and keep them in another place and wave lamps made of 454 6 flour before them. He should go near the water of a river with dance, song, music, Vedic recitations and auspicious sports and pastimes and immerse the image in a tank or in a river after the prayer 454c &lsquo;O Durgā, mother of the world, go to your place in order to come back after the lapse of a year.&rsquo; Then he should perform the sābarotsava. This last means that actions usually associated with the sabaras (i. e. aboriginal tribes like the Bhils &amp;c.) should be indulged in (to express ecstacy of the Durgāpūjā) on the 10th tithi after the immersion</p>

<p>of the image of Devi.455 The Kālaviveka quotes Satya to the effect that leave is taken of Devi on the last pāda of Sravana naksatra in the day and śābarotsava is celebrated on the 10th, and explains that what is meant is that like men of the Sabara tribe, people wear leaves of trees, their bodies are besmeared with mire, they make incoherent prancing movements and are engaged in dances, songs and music. The Kālikāpurāṇa dwells on this at great length. It says: &quot; the visarjana ( sending away) of Devī should be made with festivals in the manner of sabaras, viz. people may make merry to their heart&rsquo;s content by throwing dust and mud, with auspicious sports and revelry, with indulg ence in words and songs referring to male and female organs and with words expressive of the sexual act. The Devi becomes angry with him who does not abuse another and whom others do not abuse and pronounces on him a terrible curse.&quot; This pro vision that every one, how highsoever, was to join in the sabarotsava was probably made for emphasizing that before the Devi the highest and the lowest were of equal status and every one must join in the frolics on the 10th tithi to show that all men were equal at least one day in the year. After the immer sion friends visit friends and partake of sweets. It appears that this last practice is now not in vogue.</p>
<p>A few words must be said with reference to certain relevant matters. How Devi was to be contemplated upon can be seen from</p>
<p>p. 163, note 418 above. That shows that only the image of Devi with the lion and the demon Mahiṣāsura was to be constructed. In the Mārk. purana 56 it is stated that Devī strode over the great demon&rsquo;s throat, struck him with her trident and with her heavy sword cut off his head and made him fall down on the ground. But in modern times the image of Devi is placed in a structure of wickerwork and there are images of Lakṣmi and Gaṇośa on</p>

<p>the right side and of Sarasvati and Kartikeya on the left457. Raghunandana does not make much of these additional deities, though he speaks of the prānapratisthā of Ganesa and others. On p. 146 of &lsquo;Cave temples of India&rsquo; by Fergusson and Burgess reference is made to a tableau at Mahavalli-puram of the strife between Mahisā sura and Devi ( with eight arms), which the learned authors assign to the period 650-700 A. D. The image may be made of gold or silver, clay, metal, stone or there may only be a picture of Devī. For Durgāpūjā it is not absolutely necessary that there should be an image. Davi may be wor shipped458 in a linga, on an altar or in a book, in her pādukās ( wooden or stone feet), in imo ce, in a picture or a trident or sword or in water. Some of the purāṇas like Garuḍa and Bhaviṣya459 state that on the &lsquo;/th or 8th tithi nine wooden houses or only one with four corners may be constructed, that in the midst of it a platform or altar of four cubits in length and breadth should be made on which a throne of silk, woollen cloth and deer-skin should be prepared, whereon Durgā ( image ) made of gold, silver, clay or wood was to be established having four or ten arms, possessing a complexion like heated gold, three eyes and the moon as a head ornament.</p>
<p>There is no unanimity about the arms of Devi, The Varāha purana (95.41) speaks of 20 arms of Devi and mentions the twenty weapons she carries (95.42-43). In the Devibhagavata V.8.44 she is said to have 18 arms. Hemadri (on vrata, vol. I. pp. 923-924) quotes verses in which Devi is said to have eight arms and ten arms respectively.

<p>both ten arms and eight arms. It appears that different numbers of arms were associated with different forms and names of Devi, For example, Vidyāpati in describing the form of Kāli or Cāmunda speaks of her as having four arms. In the Virāṭaparva (chap. 6) where Yudhisthira praises Durgā, she is described (in verse 8) as having four arms.</p>
<p>There are varying views about the word &rsquo;navarātra&rsquo;. Some hold that navaratra means &rsquo;nine days and nights&rsquo;; it signifies only the time for a vrata (i. e. it is a gunavidhi), not the name of a rite (karma), while others contend that navarātra is the name of a rite or vrata, which may last for eight days ( if there is tithiksaya) or ten days (if there is viddhi of a tithi from the first tithi to the 9th). The first view is held by works like the Kalatattvavivecana (pp. 270-272), while the 2nd is held by the Nirṇayasindhu461 (p. 165), the Purusārthacintamapi (p. 61) and others. As the discussion is scholastic and hardly of any practical importance it is passed over bere.</p>
<p>The principal matters in Navarātra or Durgāpūja, though it may be spread over three days ( from 7th tithi) or nine days (from 1st to 9th), are four as laid down by the Lingapurana viz. snapana 462 (bathing the image), puja, the offering of a victim (bali) and homa. For want of space gnāpana has not been dwelt upon in the above. The Durgārcanapaddhati (p. 674). the Vrataraja (p. 340) and other digests state at length how the image of Durgā may be bathed with scented water, with milk, curds, ghee, pancagavya of a kapilā cow, sugarcane juice and what rewards are reaped by particular kinds of baths. One example is given here for a sample.463 The man who even for</p>

<p>a day bathes Candikā with pañcagavya to the accompaniment of Candigāyatri goes near Viṣṇu. If the image is made of some material (like clay) that cannot bear a water bath, the bright sword placed near Devi&rsquo;s image may be bathed or a mirror, as stated by the Kālikāpurāṇa. The other three out of the four principal items in Durgāpūjā have been dealt with above. Out of the four, pūjā is the most important and a fast is only an anga (ancillary matter).</p>
<p>Then the question arises as to when pūjā is to be performed. Here there are varying views. The Samaya-mayūkha 464 (p. 14) quoting Devi-purāṇa appears to hold that the pūjā should be in the morning, while the Nirṇayasindhu (p. 165) holds that it should be at night. It appears from the Devi-purāṇa and Kālikā purāṇa that pūjā in the morning, mid-day and at night is intended 465 When the sun is in sign Virgo, the devotee should follow the method of ayācita or nakta or take food only once or subsist only on water beginning from the nandikā tithi of the bright half, should bathe in the morning, should rise superior to the opposites (of heat and cold, happiness and pain &amp;c.) and should worship (Śiva and) Sivā three times a day.&rsquo; The Kāla tattvavivecana 466 resolves this conflict by saying that morning and midday pūjās are brief, the principal and elaborate pājā is at night only. There is some confusion caused by the texts laying down the nakṣatras, tithis or both on which the different items in the Durgāpūjā were to be performed. The Kālaviveka quotes Vyāsa as follows: &lsquo;one should awaken Devī on Ārdrā nakṣatra, make her enter (the devotee&rsquo;s house) on Mūla, and</p>

<p>having worshipped her on Uttarāsādbā should take leave of her on Śravana&rsquo;. 467 Most digests refer only to the tithis. For example, we saw above (p. 159 note 411) that on the 7th tithi the bilva branch is to be brought to the house, on the 8th fast, pūjā and jāgara are to be observed, the bali is offered on 9th, and on the 10th nirājana and discharging the Devi take place. Some texts combine the tithi and naksatra for the several parts of Durgāpūjā. For example, the Rājamārtaṇḍa verse (q. in n. 426 above) says &lsquo;one should, after propitiating with faith (Devi) by the head, flesh and blood of several kinds of animals, take leave of her on Sravana-naksatra and 10th tithi&rsquo;. The Devipurāṇa provides 468 The bilva tree should be addressed with a mantra on 6th tithi joined to Jyesthā, (the sheaf of), plants should be brought into the house on the 7th joined to Mūla, fast, pūjā and homa take place on the 8th joined to Pūrvāsādhā, on the 9th joined to Uttarāsādhā one should worship Durgā with animal sacrifices and after prostrating oneself before her leave should be taken of her on 10th tithi joined to Sravana&rsquo;. It often happened that the tithi and naksatra provided for an item did not tally and some rules were evolved. The first rule is: if both tithi and naksatra as provided tallied then that led to very good results, as said in the Lingapurāna &rsquo;even if there be no Mūla nakṣatra, one should enter the bilva branch in the house on the seventh; the same rule applies to other tithis, but if the naksatras exist on the tithis specified there is increase of the results or</p>

<p>rewards.&rsquo; The second rule was that tithi was superior 169 and therefore even if the naksatra did not exist on the tithi specified, one should follow the tithi laid down for the several items in Durgāpūjā. Devala and Lalla 70 laid this down,</p>
<p>One question on which there is difference of view is about the tithi on which Navarātra is to be begun when pratipad is mixed with amāvāsyā or dyitiy. There are very lengthy discussions in the Nirṇayasindhu, Kālatattvavivecana, Puruṣārtha-cintāmaṇi and other works. Some quote passages from the Devi and other purānas condemning the beginning of navarātra on pratipad mixed with amāvāsyā. Doyl is made471 to say &lsquo;in my worship pratipad which is joined to amāvāsyā should not be accepted; pratipad existing only for a muhūrta (two ghaṭikās) at sunrise and then joined to the 2nd tithi should be accepted ( for commencing Navarātra festival)&rsquo;. On the other hand there4710 are texts like the following: if one were to accept for the (beginning of the ) worship of Caṇdikā pratipad joined to part of 2nd tithi through ignorance or through another&rsquo;s advice, that leads to the death of that person&rsquo;s son. The Sama yamayūkha says that both classes of texts are baseless or if they are authoritative they leave the matter undecided as they are opposed to each other. The decision has to be arrived at in a different manner. &lsquo;If pratipad is mixed with amāvāsyā but does not exist the next day, then it must be accepted for starting Navarātra as there is no other alternative. Therefore, even a pratipad mixed with amāvāsyā has to be accepted in such a case in spite of texts to the contrary. If pratipad starts with sunrise and spreads over the next day for less than three muhurtas,</p>

<p>then the full pratipad has to be accepted for beginning nava rātra. If at first there is amāyāsyā for one muhūrta, then pratipad follows and then spreads over the next day up to less than three muhurtas, then this latter, that is, pratipad mixed with dvitīyā has to be accepted as the beginning. For want of space all possible alternatives are not dealt with here.</p>
<p>One important matter was not stressed above. On the first day of Navarātra one has to establish a kalasa or ghata. A full kalasa has been a symbol of holiness and prosperity from early Vedic times (compare Rg. III. 32.15 &lsquo;āpārṇo asya kalaśaḥ&rsquo;). This is a rite which is performed in the Deccan, Gujarat and Saurāṣtra even though the elaborate Durgāpūjā of Bengal finds no place there. The procedure given in Durgābhaktitarangiṇi p. 3. Nirpayasindhu (p. 767), Vratarāja (pp. 62–66), Puruṣārtha cintīmaṇi (pp. 66-67) and other works is elaborate. Ghata sthāpana is spoken of in Durgārcanapaddhati (p. 663) and has to be performed by day and not at night. One should make 472 an altar with holy clay and sow yava and wheat grains thereon with Rg. X. 97. 22, and establish a jar there of gold, silver, copper or clay with Rg. IX. 17. 4, fill the jar with water with Rg. X. 75.5 (imam me Gange &amp;c.), and cast in the jar sandal wood paste, sarvauṣadhi, 473 dūrvā grass, leaves of five trees (mango &amp;c.), clay from seven places, fruit, five jewels and gold with appropriate mantras, surround it with a piece of cloth with Rg. III. 8. 4, place a pūrṇa-pātra (a cup filled with rice grains) on the jar and worship Varupa thereon, contemplate on Durgā (as described in note 418) and invoke Durgā to come and be present in the jar along with all groups of gods and offer the upacāras from pādya onwards, fold his hands, offer a prayer and boiled rice with māsa pulse or a kūṣmāṇda &amp;c. In the Deccan the main items in the Navarātra are the establishment of ghata, offering a garland of flowers on every tithi up to the 9th, a strict</p>

If on the pratipad day on which the jar is to be established there is citrā-naksatra 474 and the astrological con. junction called Vaidhrti, it is to be done at the end of these, but if these two exist the whole of the day, then the rite should be performed in the latter part of these two. The S. M. held that these texts were baseless. According to Ghosh (p. 76), in Bengal nine jars are established in a figure (sarratobhadra) filled with coloured powders at prescribed places and these are decorated with nine differently coloured flags. But in some parts of India only one ghata is established.</p>
<p>Hemādri (on Vrata, vol. I. p. 906 ) quotes Devipurāṇa for honouring horses.75 The Durgāpūjā was meant for all. Kings and such men as kept horses were advised to honour horses in Navarātra from the 2nd tithi in conjunction with Svāti-pakṣatra up to 9th tithi. The Durgābhaktitarangiṇi devotes several pages to this nirājana of horses from Sālihotra, Bhoja, Varāba mihira and other authorities (pp. 56-63 and 67-69). Kings were advised to perform Lohabhisārika rite about horses from Asvin śukla first to Mahinavamı (H. V. I. 910-916, N. S. 178, R. N.P. 414-416). For Lohābhihārika or Nirājana rite, vide H. of Dh. Vol III. p. 230 notes 309-311 and p. 910 note 1773. Although the Kṛtyakalpataru (on vrata) does not speak of Durgotsava on the linos stated above, the Naiyatakālika section of that work (pp. 408-410) quotes a long passage from the Bhaviṣyapurāṇa 176 which states that Mahisa was killed by Candikā and therefore she should be worshipped on navami, all varpas should worship her, kings should fast on it and gifts should be made; the Devi is pleased by the offering of the</p>

<p>The Kr̥tyakalpataru on Vrata does contain a vrata called Durgāstamivrata derived from the Devipurāna (pp. 225-233), but it has nothing to do with the exploits of Durgā.</p>
<p>Hemādri also (on vrata, vol. I. pp. 856-862) contains the same vrata with a few variations. That vrata is entirely different from the Durgotsava described in the Kālikāpurāṇa. In the first place there is no reference in it to the killing of Mahiṣāsura. In the next place, that vrata is described as beginning from the 8th of Srāvana-sukla and going on for one year in each succeeding month on the 8th of the bright half. Feeding virgins and brāhmaṇas is mentioned in it also, but in each month the food offered to Devi and to the virgins is generally different.</p>
<p>About the antiquity of the worship of Durgā, vide H. of Dh. Vol. II pp. 738–739. A few matters that were not and that could not be mentioned there are noted here. Ambikā is said to be the sister of Siya in Tai. 177 S., but in the times of the Tai. Ār. X 18 Śiva is said to be the husband of Ambikā or Uma In the Vanaparva chap. 6 (where there is a long laud of Durgā 478 by Yudhisthira), she is described as the daughter of Yaśodā and Nanda and as the sister of Vasudeva, is addressed as Kāli, Mabākāli and Durgā, in verses 10-11 the weapons carried by her in her hands are mentioned and in verse 15 she is said to have destroyed Mahiṣāsura. When Arjuna (in Bhisma 23) offers a Durgāstotra at the bidding of Kṭsna, he gives her several names, among which are Kumāri, Kali, Kapāli, Kapilā, Bhadrakāli, Mahākāli, Candi, Kātyāyani, Kauśiki, Umā. But as the dates of these passages in the Mahābhārata are far from certain no chronological conclusion can be stated. Literary works and</p>

<p>coins supply some firm data about the antiquity of the Durgā cult. In the Raghuvamsa chap. II a lion is said to have been appointed a guard to protect a dela jārū (pino) tres planted by Pārvati. Pārvati is called Gauri in Raghu. II. 26 and in Kumāra sambhava. VII. 95 and Bhavāni in Kumārao (VII. 84), Capdi in Meghadūta (I. 33). Similarly, in the Kumārasambhava the Ardhanārīśvara form of Śiva is mentioned.479 The mātrs are referred to in the same work (VII. 30, 38) and also Kāli with skulls as ornaments (ibid. VII. 39). In the Mālati-mādhava (Act V) the offering of human victims to Cāmundā in the city of Padmavati is mentioned. In the Mșcchakatika VI. 27 the legend of the killing of Sumbha and Niśumbha by Durgā occurs. If we hold that Kālidāsa flourished between 350-450 A. D., the above evidence makes it quite probable that the worship of Durgā may go back some centuries before 300 A. D. The evid ence of coins lends support to this conclusion. A siñhavāhini goddess is seen on the reverse of the coins of Candragupta I of the Gupta 480 dynasty (about 305-325 A. D.). &ldquo;On a coin of the late Kuṣāṇa king Kaneshko the reverse shows the figure of a goddess with a lunar crescent seated &lsquo;full face on a lion crouching left and the godddess appears to have a noose and sceptre.481 The lion as vehicle and the noose indicate that the goddess should be Durgā and not Laksml. This would take us to the first or 2nd century A. D.</p>
<p>Why two Navarātras were recognized in Caitra and Āśvina) is a matter of conjecture. It is possible that these two pūjās arose from the fact that spring crops and autumn crops became ready at these two times. The worship of Durgā was very much influenced by Sākta doctrines and practices. Ghosh in his work on &lsquo;Durgāpūjā&rsquo; (p. XVI ff.) tries to establish that the Vedic idea of Dawn (Uṣas) spreading over the sky was changed by the Puranas and Tantras into the terrific goddess Durgā. I am not prepared to accept this explanation at all, as the links between the Vedic goddess Dawn and the terrible goddess of the Kālikā-purāṇa are altogether wanting and as there is a gap of many centuries between the disappearance of Usas from the ancient pantheon and popular worship and the emergence of Durgā. There may be some astrological connec</p>

<p>tion between Durgā ( Virgo ) riding a lion (Leo). But this also cannot be clearly made out.</p>
<p>In the Indian Historical Quarterly vol. 21 (pp. 227–231 ) Mr. N. G. Banerjee refers to the Durgotsava-paddhati of Udaya simha which begins with the Mahānavami and a saṅkalpa for victory and ends with the description of horses marching on dasami to victory and avers that this work indicates that Durgāpūjā was originally a military rite and was later on trans formed into a religious festival. He relies upon the description in the Raghuvamsa (IV. 24-25) how the advent of Sarad (autumn) season impelled Raghu to march on an invasion and to perforin the śānti rite for horses called Aśvanīrājana and also on the Bșhatsamhitā. chap. 44 (Kern&rsquo;s ed.) where occurs an elaborate description of the nirājana of horses, elephants and fighters on the 8th, 12th, or 15th of the bright half of Āśvina or Kārtika. There are serious objections against accepting this theory. It is not unknown that unconnected celebrations may be joined together on the same tithi or tithis. For example, in many parts of North India the Rāmalīlā festival for ten days is associated with Navarātra days. But Navarātra and Rāmalila are independent of each other and in some parts even of North India, only one or the other is popular and celebrated and not both. There is nothing improbable in there being two occasions for nirājana, one in Durgotsaya and another on the occasion of a king&rsquo;s march on an invasion. Besides, a work of the 15th century can hardly be relied upon as evidence for explaining the origin of a festival that was in vogue for about a thousand years at least before that work. Moreover, if it was the usage to celebrate the marching on an invasion in Āśvina with nbrājana (lustration), that rite might have been borrowed from that in Durgotsava by analogy instead of the utsava having adopted the military usage. The Kālikā-purāṇa which describes at length Durgotsava also speaks of the nirājana in Āśvina sukla on the 8th and the worship of a noble handsome horse fot seven days with sandalwood paste, flowers &amp;c. and requires the observation of the horse&rsquo;s movements for drawing prognosticsa tions (chap. 88.15–75). There is nothing to show that the details of Durgotsava described in the Kālikā and other purāṇas did not exist in the 4th, 5th and 6th centuries A. D. when Kālidāsa and Varāhamihira flourished and mentioned the lustration of horses. The theory of Mr. N. G. Banerjee appears to be unwarranted by the evidence so far available and cannot be accepted.</p>
