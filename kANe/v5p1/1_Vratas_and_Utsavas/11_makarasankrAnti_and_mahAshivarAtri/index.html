Makarasankrānti and Mahaśivarātri
Makara-Saṅkrānti. This is a very important religious observance and festival. About 70 years ago (in the author&rsquo;s boyhood) it occurred on the 12th or 13th January according to the several Indian almanacs then cuğrent, but now it falls, owing to the procession of the equinoxes, on the 13th or the 14th of January in the month of Pausa. Saṅkranti means the (apparent) passage of the sun from one rāśi (sign of the Zodiac) to the next following&#39; and hence the rāśi in which the Sun enters is designated as the Saṅkranti of that name." />

  <p>CHAPTER XI</p>
<p>Makarasankrānti and Mahaśivarātri</p>
<p>Makara-Saṅkrānti. This is a very important religious observance and festival. About 70 years ago (in the author&rsquo;s boyhood) it occurred on the 12th or 13th January according to the several Indian almanacs then cuğrent, but now it falls, owing to the procession of the equinoxes, on the 13th or the 14th of January in the month of Pausa. Saṅkranti means the (apparent) passage of the sun from one rāśi (sign of the Zodiac) to the next following' and hence the rāśi in which the Sun enters is designated as the Saṅkranti of that name. 540 When the Sun leaves the rāśi called Dhanus and enters the Makara rāśi that is called Makarasankranti. The rāśis are twelve and the Saṅkrānti names with their western equivalents are given in the note. 541 There are only twelve sankrāntis even if there be an intercalary month in some year. Everyone of the twelve sankrāntis was regarded as a holy day. The Matsya-purāṇa (chap. 98 ) deals with the completion of Saṅkrānti-vrata. Briefly, it provides that on the day previous a person, whether male or female, should take food only once in the noon and on the Saṅkrānti day should brush his teeth and then take a bath with water mixed with sesamo 542 The person should offer to a self-restrained brāhmapa householder three vessels containing edibles together with a cow intending them to be for Yama, Rudra and Dharma and repeat four verses one of which is as follows: &ldquo;As I do not make any difference between siva, Viṣṇu, the Sun and Brahmā, may Śhaṅkara (Śiva ) who pervades</p>

<p>the Universe be always a bestower of welfare on mel'. 543 The person should make, if able, further gifts of ornaments, a bed stead and golden jars ( two) to the brāhmaṇa; but, if poor, should offer only fruits to the brāhmapa. Then he should take his meal but without oil and should feed others according to his ability. Women also should perform this vrata. Great merit was attached to a bath in the Ganges on a sankranti, on an eclipse and on New and Full moon, as such a man reached the world of Brahmā.544 A bath with ordinary water (not heated ) was obligatory (nitya ) on every sankranti, since the Devi purāṇa declared : 545 “the man who would not take a bath on the holy day of Saṅkrānti would be for seven lives diseased and poor; whatever offerings are made to gods and pitrs by mon on sankranti are returned to them by the Sun again in several future lives &ldquo;.</p>
<p>. It may be stated that in ancient texts the entrance of the Sun alone in a rāśi is not regarded as holy time, but the entrance of all planets in a naksatra or rāśi was deemed to be a holy time. 546 Hemādri (on Kāla p. 437) and the Kālanirṇaya (p. 345) quote three verses 547 specifying the holy times (puṇya kāla ) of the passage of the Sun and planets as follows: in the case of the Sun the puṇya-kāla is 16 ghaṭikās before and after the moment of the Saṅkranti; for the moon it is one ghaṭi and thirteen palas on both sides, for Mars four ghaṭikās and one pala, for Mercury three ghaṭikās and 14 palas, for Jupiter 548 four</p>

<p>Though the planets also have sankrāntis, later writers hold that the word sankrānti by itself means only Ravi-sankrānti, as stated by the Smr̥ti-kaustubha p. 531.549</p>
<p>The twelve Saṅkrantis in the year are grouped into four classes, viz. there are two ayana sankrāntis (that is Makara - sankrānti from which udagayana starts and Karkata-sankrānti from which Daksiṇāyana starts ), two Visuva sankrāntis (that is, Meṣa and Tulā sankrāntis when the day and night are equal in length ), the four sankrāntis called Sadasīti or Sadasiti-mukha ( i. e. Mithuna, Kanya, Dhanus and Mina) and Viṣṇupadi or Viṣṇupada ( that is, Vrsabha, Simha, Vriscika and Kumbha) 550</p>
<p>Saṅkrānti gradually came to be deified and the Devīpurāṇa identified it with Durgā herself. The Devīpurāṇa says &quot; Devi is</p>

Some words require explanation. अलि = वृश्चिक, गो = वृषभ, हरि = सिंह, स्त्री = कग्या, चाप = धनुः, शशिधाम्नि - शशिगृहे = कर्कटके, सोम्यमयनं = उत्तरायणं, याम्य = दक्षिणायन ( यम is the lord of the south), झष = मकर, अज = मेष, तौली (one holding a balance)-तुला. Similar Verses are quoted by हे. (on काल P. 408) from वसिष्ठ, which are quoted as from पद्धवसिष्ठ by का. नि. p. 332. Some of these verses of वसिष्ठ are the same in अग्निपुराण as quoted by व.क्रि. कौ. p. 204. The राजमार्तड (Annals BORI, vol. XXXVI, p. 338 verse 275) defines षडशीति and विष्णुपदी.

<p>all-pervading on account of the division into very small and large parts in the form of year, ayana, season, month, fortnight, day and the like. Devi bestows rewards in accordance with the divisions into meritorious and sinful ( actions).551 Even one act done at that time ( of Saṅkrānti) yields results multiplied crores of times. From dharma (righteous acts) increase life, kingdom, progeny, happiness and the like, from adharma (unrighteous conduct) spring diseases, sorrows and the like; whatever is donated and whatever japa is performed near (i. e, at the time of ) Visuva ( Mesa and Tula) sankrantis and at the ayana ( Makara and Karkata sankrāntis ) becomes inexhaustible; the same holds good about Viṣṇupada and Şadaśīti-mukha'.</p>
<p>The exact moment of time when the sun leaves one rāśi and enters the next following rāśi is impossible of being marked by the eyes of flesh (ordinary human eyes). Therefore thirty ghaṭikās before and after the moment of Saṅkrānti are said to be the time. 552</p>
<p>In order to convey how infinitesimally small is the time of the Sun&rsquo;s entrance into a rāśi after leaving another the Devi purana has 553 the following : “ thirtieth part of the time taken by the throb of the eye of a man sitting happily at ease is called * tatpara'; one hundredth part of &lsquo;tatpara&rsquo; is called &lsquo;truti&rsquo;; one hundredth part of truti' is the (duration of ) time of the sun&rsquo;s</p>

<p>passage ( from one rāśi into another ). As it is not possible to perform on such an infinitesimally small point of time the rites prescribed for performance on sankrānti, one has to accept periods of time near this moment as the proper time. The first rule is that the nearer554 the ghaṭikās are to the time of actual entrance the holier they are. Therefore it is laid down that in sankrantis the puṇyatama-kala (holiest time) is sevenfold sss viz. three, four, five, seven, eight, nine or twelve ghaṭikās%3B during those periods real merit is accumulated. If one cannot perform the prescribed rites within these limits thirty ghaṭikās are permitted as the highest limit in the texts for the puṇyakāla (holy time) for all sankrāntis except Şadaśīti ( in which the maximum puṇyakāla is 60 ghaṭikās) and Viṣṇupadi (where it</p>
<p>is 16 ghaṭikās before and after ). 556</p>
<p>Each of these twelve sankrāntis in the year is seven-fold (i. e. has seven different names) according as it occurs on a particular week day or in conjunction with certain classes of naksatras. The seven names 557 are : Manda, Mandakini, DhvanksI, Ghora, Mahodari, Raksasi, and Misrita. A sankranti (such as Mesa or Karka or Makara) is called Ghorā if it occurs on Sunday, Dhvānksi on Monday, Mahodari on Tuesday, Mandām kini on Wednesday, Mandā on Thursday, Misritā on Friday and Rākṣasi on Saturday. Again, a sankrānti (like Meṣa or Karka and so on) is called respectively Manda, Mandakini, Dhvanksi Ghorā, Mahodari, Rākṣasi, Misritā according as it commences respectively on naksatras called dhruva, mrdu, ksipra, ugra,</p>

<p>cara, krūra, misrita. Vide note below 558 for the naksatras falling under these 7 groups. It is further provided that the ghaṭikās from two ( or three) to twelve said to be the holiest times (in note 555 above) are to be taken as respectively referring to the seven kinds of sankrānti i. e. two or three ghaṭikās is the holiest time in Mandā sankrānti, four ghaṭikās in Mandakini sankrānti and so on. It is laid down that Manda sankrānṭi is beneficial to brāhmaṇas, Mandākini to kṣatriyas, Dhvanksi to vaisyas, Ghora to Sudras, Mahodari to thieves, Rākṣasī brings success to vendors of liquor and Misritā increases the ( profit of the) avocations of Candalas, Pukkasas, of those whose business is of a terrible nature and of all craftsmen ( vide Hemādri on Kāla pp. 409-410 and Varsakriya-kaumudi p. 210 quoting Devipurāpa ).</p>
<p>There is some conflict on the question of the general rule about the extent of puṇyakala on a sankranti. Satatapa,559 Jābāla and Marici prescribe the sixteen ghaṭikās before and after the moment of Saṅkrānti as the pupyakāla for the perfor mance of the religious acts prescribed on Saṅkranti. On the other hand, the Devipurāṇa 560 and Vasistha lay down fifteen ghaṭikās each before and after sankranti as the puṇyakāla. This conflict is removed in various ways. One is to hold that the Devīpurāna is not restrictive but what it means is only this that lesser limits are meant to indicate that greater merit results by</p>

<p>their observance. Another explanation was to hold that the limit of 16 ghaṭikās applied to sankrāntis called Viṣṇupadi.</p>
<p>A sankranti may take place by day or at night. If Saṅkrānti occurs by day that whole day is puṇyakāla. If Saṅkrānti occurs by night, lengthy and complicated discussions occur in Hemādri, Madhava and others. One rule evolved is that in ten sankrāntis excluding Makara and Karkata sankrantis the pupyakāla is by day when those sankrāntis occur by night.</p>
<p>Several exceptions are engrafted on tbe general rule about 15 or 16 ghaṭikās before and after a sankrānti being the puṇyakāla. Therefore, several works like the Tithitattva (pp. 144-145 ) and Dharmasindhu (pp. 2–3) give brief final conclu sions on this topic. I summarize 560a the conclusions of the latter work. On the Sun&rsquo;s passage in Meṣa and Tulā the puṇyakāla is fifteen ghaṭikās before and after S ( some say ten gbaṭikās ); in Vrsabha, Simha, Vļścika, Kumbha S, P is sixteen gh. before S; in Mithuna S, Kanya, Dhanus and Mina S, P is 16 gh, after S; in Karkata S, P is thirty gh. after S; in Makara S, P is forty gh. after S. If Saṅkrānti occurs by day when a period of two ghaṭikās or less only remains before the close of the day then in the case of Mithuna, Kanyā, Dhanus, Mina and also Makara sankrāntis P is before $ for the gh. specified above against each; if S occurs in the morning at a period of two gh, or less from sunrise then in Vrsabha, Simha, Vṛścika, Kumbha and also Karkata S, P is after S for the period specified above. If s occurs at night but before midnight, P is latter half of the day time before the S; if S occurs at midnight or later than midnight but in the night, P is on two days viz. the latter half of the daytime before S and the first half of the day after S; this applies to all S except Makara and Karkata. When Uttarāyana begins in Makara in the night P is the day after S and if S begins in Karkata at night P is the day prior; if Makara S occurs at evening twilight (i. e. during three ghaṭikās after sunset ) then P is on the previous day; if Karka S occurs in morning twilight (i. e. during three gh, before sunrise ) then P</p>
<p>is on the day following the S.</p>
<p>This discussion about the puṇyakāla is necessary because a bath is to be taken and gifts are to be made during that time in order to secure the full merit thereof. The general rule is that a</p>

<p>bath is not to be taken and a gift is not to be made at night. Parāśara 561 says &lsquo;a bath by day purified by the rays of the Sun is commended; bathing at night is not commended except on seeing an eclipse&rsquo;. The Viṣṇudharmasutra says the same. But several exceptions were recognized. The Bhaviṣyapurāṇa 562 provides one should not take a bath at night and particularly should not make a gift at night, but a bath and a gift may be made at night on proper occasions. A gift at night is commended in an eclipse, marriage, sankrānti, pilgrimage, on death, on the birth of a child and at (before sitting down for) hearing itihāsa (Mahābhārata)&rsquo;. Gobhila563 provides &lsquo;people may bathe and make gifts at night in eclipses, sankrāntis, marriage, in distress (or death) and on the birth of a child and in vratas undertaken for a desired object&rsquo;. A bath is therefore obligatory on every sankrānti and particularly in Makara-sankrānti. There are special recommendations about gifts in Hemādri on Kāla (pp. 414-419 ) which are taken by him from Viśvāmitra and which are borrowed by Nirṇayasindhu (pp. 4-5), Samaya mayūkha (pp. 143-144) and others and which are as follows: gift of ram on Mesa, of cows on Vrṣabha, of clothes, food and drinks on Mithuna, of ghrtadhenu561 on Karkata, of a conveyance with some gold on Simha, of clothes and cows on Kanyā, of different kinds of grains and seeds on Tula, on Vrācika of clothes and houses, on Dhanus of clothes and conveyances, on Makara</p>

<p>Recommended gifts on sankrāntis</p>
<p>219</p>
<p>of wood and fire, on Kumbha of cows, water and grass, on Mina of fresh flowers. Special gifts are required to be made on Makarasankrānti. The Skanda 565 says &ldquo;He who donates tila dhenu on Uttarāyana (i. e. Makarasankrānti) secures all objects and obtains the highest happiness.&rsquo; The Viṣṇudharmottara provides the gift of garments on Uttarāyaṇa yields great reward (merit). A man becomes free from diseases by donating sesame and a draught bull'. The Śivarahasya declares that Śiva after he performed the Gosava sacrifice created sesame on Makara-sankrānti for the gratification of all men and provides &lsquo;men should bathe in water in which sesame are mixed and one should rub one&rsquo;s body with sesame; tarpaṇa of gods and pitrs should be made with water in which sesame have been put; sesame should be given to brāhmaṇas on Uttarāyana sankrānti; one should eat sesame and perform homa with them; those who perform homa with sesame and honour brāhmaṇas shine in the heaven (as stars) like those who donate a thousand cows; auspicious lamps fed with oil of sesame should be lighted in Śiva temples and a brāhmaṇa should worship God (Śiva ) with grains of rice and sesame&rsquo;. The Kālikā-purāṇa (q. by Hemādri on Kāla p. 413 and Kṛtyakalpao, Naiyata, pp. 366-67) provides : *one should place on the top of the linga emblem of) God (Siya) the five jewels viz. gold, diamond, sapphire, ruby and pearl; but if a man has none of these he may place in Uttarāyaṇa on the top of the linga gold one 566 karṣa or half karsa in weight; he should worship with plenty of ghee prepared from cow&rsquo;s milk and should donate gheo and a blanket after washing and pressing it; he should give condiments and a dinner to brāhmaṇag and ascetics and honour them with daksiṇā'.</p>

<p>A person should also observe a fast for three days or one day in honour of Makara-sankranti 567. A man who fasts for three days and after a bath offers worship to the Sun on ayana (i.e. start of Sun&rsquo;s apparent passage to the north or south), on Visuya day and on the eclipse of the sun or the moon secures the fulfilment of all his desires'. Apastamba says &lsquo;A man who after a bath fasts the whole day on ayana, Viṣuva and an eclipse of the sun or moon becomes free from all sins. But a house holder that has a son living was not to observe a fast on a Sunday, on sankranti and on the Sun&rsquo;s and Moon&rsquo;s eclipse&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The great merit collected by gifts on sankrāntis is set forth by the Rajamārtaṇḍa568 in two verses &lsquo;The reward ( of gifts) on ayana-sankrānti is a crore of times ( as much as of the same gift on an ordinary day) and on Viṣṇupadi a hundred thousand times; it is declared to be 86000 times on Sadasiti. Gift on the eclipse of the moon is a hundredfold ( in merit) and a thousand fold on sun&rsquo;s eclipse, one hundred thousand times on Visuva days, and of endless duration on the Full Moon days of Āṣāḍha, Kārtika, Māgha and Vaiśākha. The Bhaviṣya highly praises a bath in the Ganges on ayana and Viṣuva sankrāntis. &lsquo;He who bathes in the waters of the Ganges on ayana and Viṣuva secures the fruit of bathing in the Ganges for half a year&rsquo;. Vide Vi. Dh. III. 319. 38-45 about the gifts to be made on the several sankrāntis and the rewards of such gifts (q. by Dāna-sāgara pp. 646-647) and C. I. I. vol. IV. Nos. 28, 23, 22 for grants on Mesa, Karka and Tulā sankrantis.</p>

<p>Śrāddha on sāṅkrānti</p>
<p>221</p>
<p>Some prescribe that śrāddha should be performed on Saṅkrānti. The Viṣṇudharmasūtra 569 provides : &lsquo;the passage of the sun (from one rāśi into another), the two Viṣuya days, and specially the ayana days, Vyatīpāta (yoga), the naksatra of one&rsquo;s birth and auspicious occasions (such as a marriage, birth of a son); Prajāpati declares that these are times for śrāddha that are kāmya (i. e. they fulfil the desires one may entertain and are optional); śrāddha performed on these days tends to produce inexhaustible gratification (to the pitps )&rsquo;. Here again there was conflict. Sūlapāṇi held that the śrāddha on sankranti included pindadāna while the Nirṇayasindhu (p. 6) holds that the śrāddha should be of the pārvaṇa type but without pindas. Just as some acts such as a bath, fast and gifts were specially commended, so certain acts were forbidden on the days of sankrāntis. The Viṣṇupurāṇa 570 provides : The 14th tithi, 8th tithi, amāvāsyā and pārṇimā and the Sun&rsquo;s passage ( from one rāśi to another ), these are called parvan. The man who has sexual intercourse and partakes of oil and flesh on these parvan days goes to a hell called &lsquo;Viṇmūtra-bhojana&rsquo; (where the food is excreta and urine ). The Brahmapurāṇa 571 also says &lsquo;one should give up sexual intercourse, oil and meat on the 8th tithi, the last tithis of the two fortnights, on the day of the sun&rsquo;s sankrānti and on the penultimate day (14th tithi) in each pakṣa (half of a month)&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Hemādri ( on Vrata, vol. II. pp. 727-743) mentions fifteen sankrānti vratas such as the Sujanmāvāpti-vrata from Viṣṇu dharmottara, Devipurāna and Skandapurāṇa, which would be mentioned in the list of vratas added later on,</p>
<p>In modern times Makarasankrānti is more a social festival than a religious one. No fast is observed and hardly anyone performs śrāddha, though many people bathe in the sea or in tirthas like the Ganges at Prayaga and elsewhere. Sesame are very much in evidence, particularly in the Deccan and people</p>

<p>The importance of tilas (sesame) is brought out in the following: A person 572 who uses sesame in six ways does not sink (is not unsuccessful or unlucky) i. e. who rubs his body with sesame, who bathes with sesame, who is pure and always offers water mixed with sesame (to his deceased ancestors), and who offers sesame into fire, who makes a gift of sesame and who eats sesame.</p>
<p>Gifts are made in these days on Makarasankrānti, but mostly by women. They honour priests by donating vessels (of clay, copper or brass) containing several things such as betelnuts and coins and also invite their women friends and distribute among them earthen vessels containing red powder, pieces of turmeric, betelnut and also separately several other things such as sugarcane stalks. In south India there is a festival called Pongal 573 which corresponds with the Makara sankrānti observed in Northern and Western India, Pongal being the first day of the Tamil year. This South Indian festival lasts for three days.</p>
<p>According to the modern astronomical calculations, the winter solstice occurs on 21st December and on that day com mences the Sun&rsquo;s apparent march towards the north. But in India people who follow the almanacs based on the ancient methods and data think that the Sun&rsquo;s march towards the north takes place on the 14th of January. They are thus about twenty three days behind the correct Makarasankrānti owing to the precesion of the equinoxes. This fact was recognized even in tike medieval Dharmaśāstra works. For example, Homādri 574</p>

<p>says that twelve days before the (popular) day of a sankrānti, the real puṇyakāla occurs and therefore gifts and the like prescribed on the occasion of sankrānti should also be performed on the day twelve days prior to the popular sankrānti day.</p>
<p>The origin of the observances of Makarasankrānti cannot be very ancient. The Sun&rsquo;s apparent northward march for six months has been mentioned in Brāhmaṇa and Upanisad texts at least a thousand years before Christ. For example, the Sata patha 575 Br. states That half moon which increases represents the gods and that which decreases represents the fathers. The day represents the gods and the night represents the fathers. And further, the forenoon represents the gods and the afternoon the fathers. &hellip;Now when he (the sun) moves northwards then he is among the gods, then he guards the gods; and when he moves southwards then he is among the fathers, then he guards the fathers.&rsquo; The Chandogya-Upanisad 576 contains a reference to the Sun&rsquo;s passage to the north during six months in the words &lsquo;from light to day, from day to the bright half of the month, from the bright half of the month to the six months during which the sun goes towards the north, from the months to the year, from the year to the Sun &amp;c.&rsquo; But here the word udag-ayana is not expressly employed. The word &lsquo;ayana&rsquo; occurs in the Rgveda III 33.7 (āyannāpo ayanam-icchamānāḥ) &lsquo;the waters seeking a pass age went rushing.&rsquo; Here &lsquo;ayana&rsquo; has the etymological sense of</p>
<p>passage&rsquo; or &lsquo;place.&rsquo; But in the grhyasūtras the word &lsquo;udaga yana&rsquo; in the sense of the sun&rsquo;s northward passage occurs. The</p>

From . . p. 5 it appears that Aparārka also said in his comment on Yaj I. 217 after quoting Viṣṇudharma sūtra 77. 1-2 that the difference between the real Makarasankranti day and popular Makarasankranti day was twelve days. But those words as quoted by N. S. from Aparārka are not found in the printed Aparārka at p. 426 (Anandāsrama ed.).</p>

<p>Āśvalāyana-grhya 571 prescribes the auspicious times for certain domestic rites as follows: &lsquo;in the northward passage of the sun, in the bright half of a month and on an auspicious nakṣatra, caula ( child&rsquo;s tonsure ), upanayana, godāna and marriage may be celebrated; according to some teachers a marriage may be celebrated at all times ( not necessarily in northward passage of the sun &amp;c.)&rsquo;. But here no rāśi name appears. In Jaimini VI. 8. 23 it is provided that rites for gods are to be performed in the northward passage of the Sun, some day in the bright half of the month and on an auspicious day. As a matter of fact, none of the ancient Srauta, Gșhya or Dharmasūtras mentions any rāśis or prescribes any auspicious or inauspicious times concerned with rāśis but only times in relation to naksatras. Some people try to interpret the words &lsquo;susthe indau&rsquo; (when the moon is well placed i. e. auspicious) in Yaj. I. 80 as referring to rāśis, but they forget or ignore the fact that the earliest extant com mentator of Yājñavalkya, Viśvarūpa, explains those words as referring to naksatras and not to rāśis. The subject about the introduction of rāśis will be briefly discussed in the next section on Kāla and Muhūrta. As udagayana had already been regarded for many centuries as an auspicious period, naturally Makarasankrānti from which the northward passage of the Sun starts became a very sacred day, when the rāśi system was introduced. Why so much importance was attached to sesame on this Makarasankrānti day it is difficult to say. Probably in view of the cold prevailing at the time of the beginning of uttarāyana an oily substance like sesame easily available and of great food value was selected. In any case the observances and festival of Makarasankrānti do not appear to be much older than the beginning of the Christian era.</p>
<p>In modern pañcāngas, Makarasankranti, being deemed to be a deity, several curious matters are added, viz. sankranti rides on some vāhana (principal vehicle or draught animal such as an elephant) and an upavāhana ( as ancillary vehicle ), she wears a garment either dark, white or red or of some other colour, she is supposed to carry a weapon (such as a bow or javelin),</p>

<p>Mahāśivarātri: The 14th tithi of the dark half of a month is called Śivarātri, but the 14th of the dark half in Māgha (or in Phālguna according to the pūrnimānta reckoning) is the siya rātri par excellence and is often designated Mahāśivarātri.</p>
<p>The Garuḍapurāna I. 124, Skanda I. 1.33, Padma VI. 240, Agni 193 contain the Māhātmya of the Śivarātri on the 14th of the dark half of Māgha. Though some details differ, in all these the main outlines are the same.</p>
<p>All these praise Śivarātri-vrata highly. When after 578 observing a fast on that day, Śiva is worshipped with bilva leaves and jūgara for the whole night is observed, Śiva saves the man from hell and bestows enjoyment of happiness and moksa and the man becomes like Śiva himself. Gifts, sacrifices, austerities, pilgrimages and observances of vratas are not equal to even one ten-millionth part of Śivarātri.</p>
<p>The story that illustrates this extremely exaggerated praise of Śivarātri in the Garuḍapurāṇa seems to be the older of the three and therefore it is briefly set out here. There was a king of niṣādas named Sundarasenaka on Mount Abu, who went out</p>

<p>to a forest for hunting with his dog. He bagged no animal and bejng oppressed by hunger and thirst he remained awake the whole night on the bank of a tank in a thicket of trees. Under. neath a bilva tree there was a Śivalinga and in an effort to keen his body at ease he throw down loaves of the bilva tree which</p>
<p>fell on the top of the linga without his knowing it. In order to put down dust he (took water from the tank and) splashed it so that it fell on the linga and one of his arrows fell down from his hands on the linga through inadvertence which he took from the linga by falling on his knees before the linga. In this way he unconsciously bathed the linga, touched it, worshipped it (with bilva leaves) and kept awake the whole night. In the morning he came back to his house and partook of food given by his wife. When he died in course of time he was seized by the myrmidons of Yama, when Śiva&rsquo;s attendants fought with them and liberated him and he became a sinless attendant of Śiva together with his dog. In this way he collected merit without knowing it; if a person does with 579 full knowledge &lsquo;( what the nisāda did without knowing ) the merit is inexhaus tible. The Agnipurāpa expressly mentions the hunter Sundara senaka 580. The whole chapter of Garuḍa is quoted in the Varṣakriyā-kaumudi pp. 512-513. The story in the Skanda is more elaborate. There it is a wicked Kirāta named Canda who killed fish by catching them in his nets and killed also many animals and birds. He had a wife who matched him in his cruelty. Thus passed many years. One day he ascended a bilva tree taking water in a quiver desirous of killing a wild boar and passed the whole night without sleep keeping a watch and cast down many bilva leaves which fell on a linga at the bottom of the bilva tree. He also rinsed his mouth with water from the quiver, that fell on the linga. In this way he worshipped Śiva in all ways, viz. he bathed (snapana) the linga with water, he worshipped linga with numberless bilva leaves and he kept awake the whole night and was without food that day. He alighted from the tree and began, after reaching the tank, to catch fish. Because he did not return home that night, his wife went without food and water and passed that night in anxiety. In the morning she came to that forest with some food for her husband and seeing her husband on the other side of a river, she placed the food on the river bank and began to</p>

<p>cross the river. They both bathed in the river, but before the kirāta could reach the food a dog came there and ate all the food. When the wife wanted to kill the dog the kirāta whose heart was softened porsuaded his wife to desist from killing the dog. By that time it was noon (on amāvāsyā) and Śiva&rsquo;s attendants came there to take both the husband and wife as he had worshipped ( though unknowingly ) the linga and as both had fasted on 14th. The kirāta and his wife reached Śivaloka The Padmapurāṇa (VI. 240. 32 ff) weaves, as the Skanda does, its story round a niṣāda.</p>
<p>There is a conflict of views about what the chief thing is in Śivarātri is. The Tithitattva holds that a fast is the principal thing in Śivaratri and relies on the words of Śhaṅkara. &ldquo;On that tithi ( Śivarātri) I am not so pleased with bath (of the linga) not with clothes (offered to the linga) nor with incense nor by worship nor with the offering of flowers as I am pleased by a fast'581 On the other hand, Hemādri and Madhava hold that Śivarātri means fast, worship and jāgarana 582 and all the three are apprehended as principal and quote passages from the Skandapurāṇa and Nāgarakhanda in support.583 *That man who observes a fast on Śivaratri for twelve years and who keeps awake ( in dance and music ) before me the whole night would reach heaven. That man, who worships Śiva and performs jāgara on the 14th, would not thereafter taste milk at mother&rsquo;s breast (i. e. would not be born again); the niṣāda, unknowingly worshipping a self-existent linga, observing a fast and jāgara, became free from sin and attained the position of the attendant of Śiva&rsquo;.</p>

<p>In the Kālanirṇaya 584 there is a lengthy discussion on the question whether the word &lsquo;Śivarātri&rsquo; is used in a conventional sense ( viz. a particular tithi) or in an etymological sense (every night on which some observance relating to Śiva is performed), or a metaphorical sense (viz. a vrata, though the word expresses a tithi) or a yogarūdha sense i. 8. etymological cum conventional like the word pankaja ( a lotus). The conclusion established is that the word Śivarātri is yogarūdha like the word pankaja ( lotus), which does spring from mud (so far the sense is etymological) but which is confined to only one thing viz. lotus (so far there is rūdhi or convention) and does not apply to a frog.</p>
<p>Śivarātrivrata is both nitya (obligatory ) and kūnya (optional). It is nitya because there are passages which lay down that sin follows if a man does not perform it 585; the being that does not worship with devotion Rudra who is the lord of three worlds wanders through thousands of future lives. Besides, there are verses which lay down that the vrata should be per formed every586 year: &lsquo;O great goddess! a man and a chaste woman should every year worship Mahādeva with devotion on Siyarātri&rsquo;. This vrata is optional because the texts provide the rewards of performing this vrata. For example, vide p. 85 above and p. 86 above for the maxim of sanyoga-prthaktva.</p>
<p>This vrata according to the Isanasamhita 587 can be per formed by all human beings. &ldquo;The Śivarātrivrata destroys all</p>

<p>Fruits of sivarātrivrata</p>
<p>229</p>
<p>ging and confers enjoyment of happiness and mokṣa (final liberation ) on all human beings including cāṇdālas&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The Īsānasamhitā provides: a devotee of Viṣṇu or Śiva or of another god, if he gives up Śivarātri, destroys all the fruits of his worship ( of the deity to whom he is devoted). Everyone588 who performs this vrata has to observe certain restrictions, viz. non-injury, truthfulness, freedom from anger, celibacy, compas sion, forbearance and he has to be calm in mind, devoid of fits of passion and has to perform austerities and he should be free from malice; knowledge of this vrata should be imparted to such a one provided he follows his preceptor; if one imparts it other wise, one goes to hell.</p>
<p>The proper time for this vrata is night, since, as stated in the Skanda 589 &lsquo;goblins, the Saktis and Siya (who wields the trident) move about at night and therefore these are to be worshipped at that time on caturdasi.&rsquo; The Skanda 590 provides &lsquo;A fast should be observed on that caturdaśi of the dark half that is joined to niśitha (i. e. that exists at that time); that tithi is the best and leads to companionship with Śiva&rsquo;. Hemādri quotes Nāgarakhanda 591 as follows: on the 14th of the dark half of Māgha I shall go in the Kaliyuga on the surface of the earth at night and not by day. I shall undoubtedly transfer myself to all lingas, whether movable or permanently fixed, for the removal of the sins committed in the (preceding ) year; therefore the man who offers worship to me at night with these mantras will be free from sin'. In the Iśānasamhitā it is said *The first God (Śiva ) appeared in the form of Śivalinga, whose refulgence was equal to that of a crore of suns, on the 14th of Māgha dark half.

<p>vrata should be one that covers that time. A man should perform this vrata on that tithi when the 14th covers the time before and after midnight.' 592 Hemādri also quotes a verse like this &lsquo;The 14th tithi called Śivarātri that covers pradosa should be accepted (for vrata); one should observe a fast on that tithi since there has to be a jāgara (in that vrata) at night.&lsquo;593</p>
<p>Owing to the above somewhat conflicting dicta there is a great deal of discussion on the proper day and time for the vrata in Hemādri on Kāla (pp. 298–308), Kālanirṇaya (pp. 297 ff). Tithitattva (pp. 125-126), Nirṇayasindhu (pp. 222-224), Puruṣārthacintāmaṇi (pp. 248–253) and other works. Some works like the Nirṇayāmṛta 594 put emphasis on the word pradosa (in note 593) above, while others emphasize the word niśitha and ardharātra. The conclusions drawn by Mādhava (the prince of nirṇayakāras) are stated here. If caturdaśl covers both pradosa and niśitha, then the vrata should be observed on that day. If caturdaśī spreads over two days (i.e. it is mixed with 13th and also with amāvāsya) and 14th exists at the time of niśitha on both days, or if it does not so exist on any of the two days, then covering pradosa is the determining factor; where 14th covers pradosa on two days or does not cover pradosa on any of the two days, then existing at nisitha is the determin ing factor; if caturdaśi having extended over two days covers only one out of the two (pradosa and niśitha) on each day then conjunction with Jayā (i. e. 13th tithi) is the decisive factor.595</p>
<p>A brief description of how Śivarātrivrata was performed in ancient times may be gathered from Garuḍapurāna I. 124. 11-23. After honouring Śiva on the 13th tithi the man who is to under take the vrata should resolve to observe certain restrictions. He should declare &lsquo;O God I shall keep awake the whole night on the</p>

<p>Description of sivarātrivrata</p>
<p>231</p>
<p>14th tithi. I shall make according to my ability worship, gifts, austerities and homa. O Sambhul on 14th I shall take no food and shall take food on the next day. Oh Lord! be thou my refuge for securing enjoyment of happiness and moksa. The person observing the vrata should approach a teacher and should bathe (the linga) with pañcagarya and with pañcamrta. He should repeat the mantra &lsquo;Om namah Sivāya.&rsquo; He should worship Śiva with the upacāras beginning with sandalwood paste and he should offer into fire sesame, grains of rice and boiled rice mixed with ghee. After this homa he should offer pārnāhuti (an offering made with a full ladle) and listen to music and good stories (about Śiva). He should again offer offerings at midnight, in the 3rd quarter of the night and in the 4th quarter. Having inaudibly repeated the mūlamantra (om namah Sivāya) he should pray to Śiva about daybreak to forgive his sins with the words &lsquo;O God! I have worshipped in this vrata without obstacles through your favour; O Lord of the worlds i O Śival pardon me. Whatever merit I have won this day and whatever has been offered by me to Śiva I have finished this vrata to-day through your favour; O bountiful onel be pleased with me, and go to your abode; there is no doubt that I have become pure by merely seeing you.&rsquo; He should seed persons who are devoted to contemplating (on Śiva) and should give to them garments, umbrellas and the like; &lsquo;O Lord of Gods! lord of all things! that bestoweth favour on people; may my lord be gratified by what I have given with faith.&rsquo; Having thus prayed for forgiveness, the person undertaking this vrata may carry it on for twelve years. After obtaining fame, wealth, sons and kingdom he may repair to the city of Siya; he should perform jāgara (on 14th) in all the 12 months of the year; the man undertaking the vrata after feeding twelve brāhmaṇas and donating lamps may secure heaven.</p>
<p>The Tithitattva (p. 127) adds some details which are interesting. The linga is to be bathed with milk in the first watch of the night, with curds in the 2nd, with ghee in the 3rd and with honey in the 4th. The mantras in the four watches are respectively &lsquo;hrim, Iśānāya namaḥ,&rsquo; hrim Agho rāya namah,&lsquo;&lsquo;hrim Vāmadevāya namaḥ&rsquo; and &lsquo;hrim Sadyojātaya namaḥ.&rsquo; The mantra at the time of offering arghya is also different in each of the four watches. It is further provided that there should be songs and dances in the first watch of the</p>
<p>232</p>
<p>night. The Varsakriyākaumudi (p. 513) provides that in the 2nd, 3rd and 4th watches also the person undergoing vrata has to perform worship, arghya, japa and listening to stories (about Siya), to offer hymns of praise and make prostrations and at day-break he should pray for forgiveness with arghya water, If Māgha-kļśṇa 14th falls on a Sunday or Tuesday, that is most commendable for this vrata.5%</p>
<p>Later medieval digests such as the Tithitattva (pp. 126 ff), the Kālatattvavivecana (pp. 197–203), Purusārthacintamani (pp. 255-258 ), Dharmasindhu (p. 127 ) provide an elaborate description of the procedure of Śivarātri vrata. The K. T. V, remarks 597 that the procedure of Śivarātri-vrata is different in the several purānas. For comparison with the one in the Garuḍa quoted above a summary of it from the Dharmasindhu is given here. On the 13th tithi the performer should take only one meal in the noon, on the 14th after finishing his usual morning duties and rites, he should make a saṅkalpa in the morning with a mantra &lsquo;I shall perform this Śivarātrivrata that yields great rewards; O Lord of the world I may it be without obstacles through your favour. On the 14th I shall be without food and shall tako my meal on the next day for enjoyment of pleasures and mokṣa, O Lord I be you my refuge.&rsquo; If the per former be a brāhmaṇa, he should recite the two ?k verses598 &lsquo;rātrim prapadye&rsquo; and cast water. In the evening (of 14th ) he should take a bath with black sesame, should apply the tripundra mark 599 with ashes to his forehead and also hold a rosary of rudrākṣa ( berry of Elaeocarpus Ganitrus), should go to a temple of Śiva at the beginning of night, should wash his feet, should take ācamana (should sip water) and should make a saṅkalpa &lsquo;I shall perform the pūjā of the first watch on Śivaratri&rsquo;; if he intends to perform separate pūjās on all the four watches or if he wants to perform a pūjā only once he should say &lsquo;I shall perform the worship of Śiva on Siyarātri for securing the favour of Śiva.&rsquo; Then he should repeat the sage (Vāmadeva)</p>

Then he should bow to the sage, metre and Sadāśiva and perform nyāsa on the several parts of the body from the heart with appropriate mystic letters and mantras (such as &lsquo;om namas-tat-puruṣāya namaḥ hrdaye&rsquo; to the last &lsquo;om yam astrāya phat); then he should worship the jar ( kalasa ) and contemplate on Śiva as portrayed 600 in the verse quoted below. He should then establish a linga by performing the prāṇa pratisthā and touch it and should invoke 601 Śiva with four mantras and pray Śiva to be present in the linga till the end of the pūjā. Then he should offer an anjali of flowers. If the linga is already permanently fixed or if the linga, though not fixed, has already been established with the necessary samskāras, he should omit the details from prāṇapratisthā to āvāhana, Then he should perform the remaining upacāras (out of 16 ) from āsana to the last.

At the end of snāna ( of the linga ) the performer should give ācamana water ( to the linga ) and perform tarpaṇa with water mixed with aksatas for Śiva with eight names (Bhava 603 &amp;c.) and the wives of these eight. After flowers the performer should offer 1008 or 108</p>

<p>bilva leaves with the thousand names of Śiva'&rsquo;t or with mūla mantra. After naivedya he should offer ācamana and fruits with mulamantra. After tūmbūla he should wave a lamp ( before the linga) with the mūlamantra and Vedic mantras, offer mantra puspa with the mantra &lsquo;om namah Sivāya&rsquo; and offer eight namaskāras to the eight names &lsquo;Bhava&rsquo; &amp;c. ( quoted in note 603) and to their wives. Then he should offer twelve añjalis of</p>
<p>flowers with the twelve names 605 ( noted below ), perform prarlak &ndash;ṣiṇā and namaskūras with mālamantra, repeat inaudibly the mūlamantra 108 times, should pray for forgiveness and should declare ( before linga) &lsquo;May Samba Sadāśiva be pleased with this pūjā.</p>
<p>If a man undertook a vrata to observe Śivarātri for 24 or 14 years or 12 years he has to perform the udyāpana thereof at</p>

<p>· preceding and following tithis, the one mixed with the preceding tithi should be accepted for the prescribed rite and the pāranā should be performed at the end of the tithi prescribed; fast on 14th and pāraṇā on the 14th itself — such an occurrence may be had only if one has lakhs of good deeds to one&rsquo;s credit&rsquo;, The conclusions established by the Dharmasindhu p. 126 are;</p>

<li>If caturdaśī tithi ends before three watches of the night end, then the pāraṇā should be at the erd of the (14th ) tithi: if caturdaśī ( tithi) extends beyond the three watches of the night, then at daybreak the pāraṇā takes place in the midst of the 14th; these are the views of Mādhava and others; the opinion of the Nirṇayasindhu is that even when the caturdaśi tithi ends before the three watches of the night the pāraṇā must be observed in the midst of the caturdaśī and not at the end of caturdaśī.</li>

<p>In modern times very few, if at all, go through the prc cedure prescribed even in the Dharmasindhu. A fast is observed and Śiva is worshipped and people may listen to stories of Śiva&rsquo;s exploits. Common people in some parts drink a beverage called bhāng prepared by pouring water on crushed hemp leaves with the addition of almonds, rose leaves, opium seeds &amp;c. It is supposed to be dear to Śhaṅkara. In many temples of Śiva, water is made to drip on the linga incessantly.</p>
<p>Mr. Gupte (pp. 208–215 ) after detailing the story of a hunter and a doe, her mate buck and two young ones connects the Śivarātri observances with the constellation of Mrgaśirsa together with Sirius (the Hunter), but he is at a loss to explain why the 14th of Māgha-krsna should have been selected for a fast. Mr. Mukerji (pp. 33-37 ) contents himself by referring to the Śivarātrimāhātmya in Santiparva. The constellation of Mrgasirsa and the brightest star Sirius had attracted the minds of ancient Indians. The Ait. Br. (XIII, 9 )608 narrates how Prajapati seeking his own daughter for intercourse sinned, how he assumed the form of an antelope and how the gods brought together their terrible forms, which became Rudra whom they asked to pierce the antelope. When Rudra pierced the antelope, the latter fled up into the sky. People call it Mļga ( Mrgaśīrṣa ) and Rudra became the hunter ( Mrgavyādha), the daughter became Rohiṇi and the arrow (with its three parts ) became the three arrow-like stars.</p>
<p>In the Lingapurāṇa as quoted in the Vratarāja ( pp. 573– 586 ) there is the story of a hunter (nisāda ) who when bent on killing a doe, her mate and children unknowingly performed all the characteristic actions of Śivarātrivrata and</p>

<p>___ There are other Śivaratrivratas as in E. V. II. 71-87 (which are different from the one described in Skanda I. 1.33), or in H.V. II. 87-92, or in H. V. II. 114-122, or in H. V. II. 122-130 (from</p>
