<p>PUBLISHER&rsquo;S NOTE</p>
<p>It is with a sense of profound gratification that the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute presents to the public the second part of the fifth and last volume of the History of Dharmaśāstra by MM. Professor Dr. P. V. Kane, National Professor of Indology. With this part, this monumental literary project, which was conceived by the author more than thirty years ago, has been brought to a successful completion. This must, indeed, be regarded as a memorable event in the history of Indological studies and research in this country. The five volumes of the History of Dharmaśāstra together extend over nearly 6,500 pages, and constitute an authoritative and encyclopa:dic treatment of the religious and civil law of ancient and medieval India. And what is particularly remarkable is that Professor Kane has accomplished this enormous work single-handed, and that too while being fully occupied with various other literary and public activities.</p>
<p>For Professor Kane, the Ilistory of Dharmaśāstra is the crowning glory of a life of great fulfilment; and, for the Institute, it is a matter of pride and honour to be so closely associated with it.</p>
<p>Professor Kane is now eighty-two years.of age, but his energy and enthusiasm by no means seem to be on the wane For, he has agreed ( health permitting ) to prepare for the Insti tute a revised and enlarged edition of the first volume of the History, which has now almost gone out of print.</p>

<p>FOREWORD</p>
<p>Professor Pandurang Vaman Kane, by his monu mental volumes on Dharmaśāstra, has placed us all under a deep debt of gratitude to him. His work is of lasting value. At a time when we are building an integrated Indian society, a dispassionate study of our Dharmasāstras is essential. By his work we are helped to understand what is living and what is dead in the heritage which has come down to us.</p>
<p>Our heritage has always been changing with refe rence to new conditions and new pressures. The pro cess of readaptation is now at work. In spite of many changes the obstacles to Indian unity require to be removed. The principles which should guide us in the reorientation of our society are well brought out in Professor Kane&rsquo;s volumes. They may be said to be religious and social.</p>
<p>True religion has three sides to it: (1) a state of mind; (2) a relationship to Reality; and (3) a way of life.</p>
<p>State of mind. Religious scriptures speak of the passionate quest for spiritual illumination. Religion is inner illumination, a renewal of spirit, an awakening, a changed condition of mind. This is the knowledge of God and not merely belief in Him. This is achieved by study, discipline, meditation and purity of heart.</p>
<p>Relationship to Reality. Nearness to God is the goal of religious aspirants. When they attain an in sight into Reality, their words are full of rapturous delight. They make out that the Reality they en counter is ineftable, incapable of adequate expression.</p>
<p>History of Dharma sūstra</p>
<p>It transcends the distinction of subject and object, the duality which is essential for knowledye.</p>
<p>The absolute of experience is not the absolute of language or of logio. The Real to which we belong is beyond description in its majesty, power and glory. Spiritual humility requires us to look upon the varied expressions and interpretations as suggestions of the Supreme. By encouraging dogmatism and the use of force to spread belief, religions have become discredited.</p>
<p>Tbe seers affirm that they are one with the Sup reme : ahar brahmāsni. Hallāj exclaims : “ I am the truth&quot; and was executed for his heterodoxy.</p>
<p>A well-known Sufi tradition attributes to the pro phet a saying : &ldquo;He who knows the self knows the Lord&rdquo;. Of Abu Yazid it is recorded that he said: &ldquo;I sloughed off my self as a snake sloughs off its skin ; then I looked into my self, and lo, I was He&rdquo;. Reli gion, it is said, springs from the great &lsquo;I am in each &lsquo;me&rsquo;. The fountains are within.</p>
<p>On the pathway to the goal we feel that the attainment of the goal is conditioned by the effort of the seeker and the grace of God - tupah-prabhāva and deva-prasada.</p>
<p>The seekers look upon the Supreme As &amp; Person separate from us, whose commands we obey, whose will we accept with reverence. The One beyond sonse-per ception, speech and logic is also the Controller, the Lord of all, the Creator and Ordainer of all, « There is nothing marvellous in my love for you, O God, you are a mighty being but your love for me a poor slave is really marvellous. It is impossible to know thee and not to love thee.&quot; The personal is not a falsification of</p>
<ol>
<li>Of. Bṣhadūranyaka Upanijad IV. 4. 7.</li>
</ol>
<p>Foreword</p>
<p>the real. It is a manifestation of the Supreme. In some of the Upaniṣads — Svetāśvatara for example - as in the Bhagavadgitā, the Supreme is a God of love and grace. Those who adopt the view of religion as experi ence, communion with God, are free from the tyranny of dogmas, from the fanaticism which is a disease of the mind to which men and communities are subject.</p>
<p>We are vulnerable to mass hysteria. This need not be so for human nature is infinitely malleable. If we feel that anything is true or beautiful, we are per suaded that it must find acceptance from others. We cannot but communicate to others what we know to be the truth. But when claims to absolute truth are varied and conflicting, humility requires us to respect the deepest convictions of others.</p>
<p>Way of Life. In some systems of thought a dis tinction is made between two orders of being, meta physical and empirical. It does not mean that the latter is illusory. The distinction between the two is not absolute. The metaphysical reality is immanent in the world of becoming and makes for the gradual unfolding of values. This world is consecrated ground. Our sages set forth in clear and shining words the ideal of participation in the work of the world in order to raise its quality. Karmabhūnim incin prāpya karta vyam karna yat snubham says Rāma, according to Vālmīki. Having come into this world of action one should perform good deeds. Vālmīki continues that the great sages have attained heaven through the perfor mance of good deeds. It does not matter whether you are a grhastha or householder, scorinyāsin or mendicant. Janaka was a householder, and sage Yājñavalkya was a wandering mendicant, parivrājaka. If we behave well, we will make the world a paradise ; if we misbehare we will turn it into hell.</p>
<p>Vyavasāyātmikā budilhir eke’ha kurunandana. The traiped understanding is single-minded. Integrity refers to the quality of oneness. It does not mean alienation from the world. Religion does not mean other-worldiness, separating oneself from all created things. It is denial of egoism. Turning one&rsquo;s back on the world is a part of ascetic discipline which is not an end in itself. Liberation from the tyranny of time is not liberation from time. When we become spiritual in outlook we do not cease to be hum an.</p>
<p>The secret of true greatness is love of fellowmen. Love of neighbour is not only a moral duty but a wise policy. The right course today is co-operation and not conflict. “What merit is there in the goodness of a man who returns good for good ? A good man verily is one who returns good for evil,&quot; Rūmarājya or the Kingdom of God is the ideal for the human community. The one hope for the peoples of the world to get to gether is a change in the human heart.</p>
<p>Ethical standards are the only criteria for the distinction between high and low among men. Purity of conduct elevates a man even as impurity degrades him. All other distinctions are irrelevant. The Chan dogya Upaniṣad refers to patitas. The Cāṇdālas are those given to stealing, drinking, adultery and murder. These four are fallen : ete patanti catvārah.&rsquo; A patita, a fallen man, is a wicked man, a small-minded selfish man, not an untouchable.</p>
<p>The caste distinctions may have had their value in another context of society but we have out-grown it.</p>

<p>apakūrigu yaḥ sūdhuli sa sudhuk saduhir ugyafe 11 2. V. 10.9.Horsword</p>
<p>The Bhagavadgitā speaks of the four-fold classification as based on guna ( character) and karma ( work ).</p>
<p>We are all unregenerate at birth and become re generate by our effort.</p>
<p>janmanā jāyate sūdraḥ</p>
<p>saṁskārād dvija ucyate i Some are advanced; others not. We should give equal facilities to all. The Mahābhūrata says that there was only one varna at the beginning and the four castes arose out of later developments.</p>
<p>ekavarṇam idaṁ pūrvaṁ viśvam āsid yudhisthira »</p>
<p>karma-kriyā-vibhedena cīturvarnyar pratișthitam 11 But we have come to base caste on birth though some of our leading writers have held that it is not birth or learning but conduct alone that constitutes its basis ; for dvijatva,</p>
<p>vrttani cua tu kāranani i vcdapāṭhcna vipras to brahmajñānīt tu brāhmanaḥ 11 It is not the colour of the skin but the conduct of the person that counts. The only way to progress is by means of good conduct. The Sarıcarta-Smrti says :</p>
<p>sadācārcna devatran rṣitvari vai tathaixa ca i</p>
<p>prāpnuvanti kuyonitvani manııṣyās tadviparyaye il Great achievement is possible for each one of us.</p>
<p>Professor Kane brings out with great learning and lucidity the frequent changes our society has passed through. When Manu (I. 85 ) tells us that different customs prevailed in different ages he suggests that the social code is not a fixed but a Hexible one.' Social</p>

<p>vi</p>
<p>customs and institutions are subject to change. Yājña valkya tells us that “one should not practise that which, though ordained by the Smrti, is condemned by the people.”? What appeals to one&rsquo;s conscience, ātmanas tuṣṭih, the conscience of the disciplined, not of the superficial, the forms which the elect praise, should be our standard.</p>
<p>Vital changes may be introduced in the habits of the people by pariṣarls or assemblies of the learned. When such assemblies cannot be constituted even the decision of one learned in &lt;blocarma will be authoritative. The Apastamba Dharmasūtra says : dharmajña-samayaḥ pramānan. People who are learned and compassionate, who are practical-minded can decide the issues of right and wrong. They are the conscience of the commu nity. What we are doing by legislative enactments ‘is consistent with our tradition,</p>

<p>PREFACE TO VOLUME V</p>
<p>The fourth volume of the History of Dharmaśāstra was published in October 1953, i.e. more than eight years ago. This last volume was in the Press for more than five years. The delay is due to several causes This volume in two parts contains over 1700 pages. It is thus far more bulky than any of the previous volumes. Nonavailability of sufficient quantity of good printing paper was another cause. The third cause was my age (I am now 82 years old ) and frequent bad health. It is gratifying to my friends and myself that at last this undertaking spread over thirty-seven years is completed.</p>
<p>This volume is divided into ten sections. The first section deals with Vratas and Utsavas ( religious pows and festivals ); the second with Kāla (time), Muhūrta ( auspicious times ), and calendar; the third with Śāntis (propitiatory rites for averting the wrath of a deity, a calamity or unlucky event); the fourth and fifth with Purāṇas and Dharmaśāstra and the causes of the disappearance of Buddhism from India ; the sixth with Tāntrik doctrines and Dharmaśāstra; the seventh with Mimāṁsā and Dharmaśāstra ; the eighth with Sāṅkhya, Yoga, Tarka and Dharmaśāstra ; the ninth with cosmology, Karma and Punarjanma ; the tenth with the fundamental conceptions and characteristics of Hindu ( Bharatiya ) culture and civilization, and future trends.</p>
<p>In the Preface to the 2nd volume I have indicated the reasons for numerous and lengthy Sanskrit quota. tions. In the Preface to the 4th volume I have mentio ned the aim I had in view in bringing together the facts</p>
<p>vui</p>
<p>in each branch of Dharmaśāstra with detachment and integrity and without bias. The same aim and mental attitude hare been kept in view in this volune also. But it may be argued that when an author selects some of the numerous facts he passes a judgement about the importance of facts and his judgement may be biased all the same. I do not dispute this argu ment, but will only argue that, facts being numerous and there being limitations imposed by the space available, the author has a right to pronounce a judge ment as to the importance of the facts he selects.</p>
<p>As regards volumes two, three and four, I could rely on a tower of strength in the person of Parama hamsa Svāni Kevalānanda Sarasvati of Wai. But, anfortunately the Syāmi passed away in March 1955 before I began to write this last volume, and I could not get the benefit of his wise counsel in this fifth volume.</p>
<p>In this last volume I received help from many people, either personally or by correspondence. I have to thank Mr. M. B. Arte, Dr. R. N. Dandekar, and Prof. H. D. Velankar for help in translating impor tant passages from several French and German works, Prof. Gode, Curator of the Bhandarkar Oriental Resea. rch Institute, Poona, was always ready to render help us to manuscripts and books. He had been a close friend for nearly forty years and his sudden death has meant for me the loss of a learned, sympathetic, and ever-obliging friend. Dr. A. D. Pugalker very carefully read the chapters on Parāṇas and indicated several mis prints and some inaccurate statements. Dr. Raghavan very kindly brought to my notice the calendars in use in Southern India and certain works op Vratas ; Pandit Srījiva Nyāyatirtha sent me in Sanskrit the Naiyāyika view on Kāla; Miss Kunda Sathe (now Mrs. Saykar )</p>
<p>Preface</p>
<p>kindly sent me from Paris information from French scholars on Babylonian, Assyrian and Greek astronomy., I am highly obliged to Dr. B. S. Joshi for sending me microfilms of certain papers ( not available in India ) from Cambridge and Chicago. Prof. Durgamohan Bha ttacharya kindly sent me a copy of the Kāla-siddhinter darsini. I am under deep obligations to Svāmī Kuva layānanda of Lonarla for reading my chapter on Yoga and suggesting valuable changes and amendments. Prof. Zala gave me details about the Vratas observed in Saurāṣtra. Prof. G. H. Bhatt (Baroda ) and Mr. S. L Katre ( Curator, Scindia Institute, Ujjain ) very kindly showed me the manuscript-wealth of their Institutes and helped me with the contents of several relevant mgs. on Vratus and Kāla. Shri Padeśāstrī of Baroda discussed with me, personally and by correspondence, several points about Ancient Hindu Astronomy. MM. Dr. Umesh Mishra brought to my notice his edi tion of the Vijūānalipikū of Padmapāda and Dr. H. G. Narahari wrote to me about the Prīrabdha-dheanta vidhvansana of Acyutarīva and sent me off-prints of his papers thereon. Mr. Shankarrao Joshi of the Bhārata Itihāsa Samodhaka andala of Poona helped me by bringing to my notice hand-written calendars more than two hundred years old. To all these I offer my best thanks. I am highly obliged to Mr. S. N. Savadi B.A. (HONS.) of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute for help in the correction of the proofs of this volume. I have to thank Mr. P. M. Purandare, Advocate (O. S.), Bombay High Court, Tarkatirtha Raghunāthuśāstri Kokje of Lonavla, and Dr. Bhaba tosh Bhattacharya for reading the printed sheets and making suggestions and pointing out misprints. Mr. N. G. Chupekar, in spite of his being now over 91 years of age, rend some chapters when they were only typewritten, and discussed them personally</p>
<p>llistory of Dharmasastra</p>
<p>with me for some hours. To him I owe a deep debt of gratitude for having taken so much trouble at such a very advanced age. I am highly obliged to Dr. A. Ghosh, Director-General of the Archaeological Survey of India, and to the Librarian Mr. L. G. Parab and the staff of the Archaeological Library for rendering all help to me while I had been collecting material for this volume.</p>
<p>I cannot find words adequate enough to express my sense of deep gratitude to Dr. Radhakrishnan, now President of India, who has favoured me with many kindnesses during the last fourteen years. As for this volume of the History of Dherma:astra, in the midst of numerous engagements and heavy work, he found time to look into its last two chapters, made vital sug. gestions for their improvement, and finally contributed a learned Foreword.</p>
<p>I am aware that, in spite of so much help rendered by so many friends and well-wishers, this large volume might contain many mistakes, for which I alone am responsible. In the process of printing, some diacritical marks have either been elided or placed in wrong places, for which I seek the indulgence of all scholars and readers.</p>
<p>Lastly, I thank the Manager of the Aryabhushan Press of Poona for carrying out with energy and zeal the work of printing this very large volume bristling with thousands of quotations, in the face of great diffi.</p>
<p>culties caused by shortage of paper, the Poona foods,</p>
<p>· and other unforeseen happenings.</p>

<p>CHRONOLOGICAL TABLE of some important works and authors.</p>
<p>referred to in vol. V.</p>
<p>N. B. Some dates, particularly of ancient works, are</p>
<p>more or less conjectural. 4000 B. C.-1000 B. C.- The period of the Vedic Saṁ</p>
<p>hitās, Brālımaṇas and Upaniṣads ; some hymns of the Rgveda, of the Atharvaveda and verses in the Taittirīya Samhitā and Brāhmanas may possibly go back to a period earlier than 4000 B. C. and some of the Upaniṣads (even from among those that are regarded by most scholars as the earliest ones) may be later than 1000 B. C.. Some scholars have criticized me for assigning the Vedic Samhitās to such an early date as 4000 B.C. Bloomfield, in</p>
<p>• Religion of the Ved:'(New York, 1908 ) was will ing (on p. 20 ) to regard 2000 B. C. for the begin nings of Vedic literary productions and to assign a much earlier date for institutions and religious concepts which the Veda derived and he denies that there is any better proof for any later date such as 1:00, 1200 or 1000 B. C. rather than for one of the earlier viz. 2000 B. C. Winternitz ( in</p>
<p>Some problems of Indian Literature&rsquo; which are his Calcutta Readership Lectures, p. 20 ) remarks</p>
<p>it is more probable that this unknowo time of the Vedic Literature was nearer 2500 B. C. or 2000 B. C. than to 1500 or 1200 B.C. Both Bloomfield and Winternitz frankly confess that they know nothing at all about the date of the early Vedic Literature. Some Western scholars are rather too cocksure or dogmatic than the facts warrant.</p>

<p>ŚĀNTI (Propitiatory rites for averting a deity&rsquo;s wrath,</p>
<p>a calamity or unlucky event),</p>
<p>CHAPTER XX</p>
<p>Vedic meaning and procedure of Sāntis</p>
<p>The word śānti is derived from the root &lsquo;sam&rsquo;, which has several meanings (such as &lsquo;to stop&rsquo;, &lsquo;to be appeased&rsquo;, &lsquo;to kill&rsquo; rarely) and belongs to the 4th conjugation and also to the 9th. The word Śānti itself does not occur in the Rgveda, but it occurs in the Atharvaveda and the Vājasaneya Samhitā. The root</p>
<p>sam', its several forms and derivatives and the indeclinable particle sam' occur hundreds of times even in the Rgveda. The word &lsquo;sam&rsquo; is often conjoined in the Rgveda to&rsquo;yoh' either as &lsquo;samyoh&rsquo; (Rg. I. 93.7, I. 106.5, III 17.3, III, 18.4, IV. 12.5, V. 47.7, V. 53.14, V. 69.3, VI. 50.7, VII. 35.1, VII, 69.5, X. 9.4, X 15.4, X. 37.11, X. 182.1-3) or as &lsquo;śam ca yośca&rsquo; (as in Rg. I. 114.2, 189.2, II. 33.13, VIII, 39.4, VIII. 71.15). In these places the words are generally rendered as &ldquo;happiness and welfare' or health and wealth' (by Keith in translation of Tai. S. II. 6.10.3) and these meanings generally suit the context, e. g. in Rg. VI. 50.7 &lsquo;dhāta tokāya tanayāya sam yoh&rsquo; (confer on our sons and progeny happiness and welfare), in Rg. X. 182 the words *athā karad-yajamānāya saṁ yoh'(may Bșhaspati confer happi ness and welfare on the sacrificer) occur as the last quarter of all the three verses. &lsquo;Sam&rsquo; by itself occurs about 160 times in the Rgveda and it is somewliat romarkable that in Rg. VII, 35. 1-13 1132 the word sam occurs in each verse from 4 to 7 times (68 times in all). Rg. I. 114. 1 1133 ve bring these lauds to Rudra who is powerful, who has braided hair, who rules over valiant men, so that there may result welfare to our two-footed and four-footed beings and every thing in this village may be prosperous and free from distress' will bring out the import of</p>
<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; 1132. Verses 1-10 of Kg. VII. 35 arc the same as Atbarva 19.10 1-10.</p>

<p>( Seo. III, Ch. XX</p>
<p>śam'. In some cases “san' and &lsquo;yoh&rsquo; clearly appear to be employed like nouns in the objective case. For example, Rg. II. 33. 13 1134 &ldquo;I hanker after the sam&rsquo;and &lsquo;yoh&rsquo; of Rudra (i. 6. under the power of Rudra), Ry. I. 111.2 &ldquo;O Rudra! may we secure by your guidance that&rsquo;samn&rsquo;and &lsquo;yoḥ&rsquo; that father Manu procured through sacrifice&rdquo;. Yāska (Nirukta IV, 21) while dealing with Rg. X. 15. 4 &lsquo;athā naḥ sam yor-arapo dadhāta&rsquo; holds &lsquo;samyoh&rsquo; to be ablative or genitiro of samyu and explains as &lsquo;samanam ca rogāṇām sīvanam ca bhayānām (allaying of diseases and warding off of dangers). This is an etymological explanation and is in some cases accepted by Sayans and in others he paraphrases &lsquo;sam&rsquo; by &lsquo;sukha&rsquo;(happiness) and &lsquo;yoḥ&rsquo;as &lsquo;duḥkha-viyoga&rsquo; (freedoni from pain or distress). The word &lsquo;yoḥ&rsquo; presents the appearance of the ablative or genitive singular of a noun from the root &lsquo;yu&rsquo; which means &lsquo;to bind&rsquo; or</p>
<p>separate&rsquo; or from &lsquo;yā&rsquo; to go. &ldquo;Yoh&rsquo; by itself ocours only three times in the Rgveda (i. e, in I. 74. 7, X. 105. 3, X. 176. 3). The meaning of &lsquo;yoh&rsquo; in these three cases is doubtful. In the Tai. Br. 1135 we have the mantra &lsquo;we choose that happiness and wel fare and success (or progress) to the sacrifico and the sacrificer; may divine fortune be ours; let there be good fortune for (our) men; may medicine (or remedy ) go up; may there be happiness to our men and quadrupeds&rsquo;.</p>
<p>In Atharvaveda 19. 9 the word śānti occurs about 17 times. In verses 3 to 5 speech ( vāk), the mind( manaḥ )1136 and the five senses are referred to and it is said that these geven usually produce what is ghora ( terrible or inauspicious ) and these same must exert themselves for producing śānti ( i. e. appeasement of angered deities or averting calamities or misfortunes). Verses 6-11 pray to several gods, planets (grabāḥ), the earth, falling stars, cows, the nakṣatras, magical rites, Rāhu, Dhūmaketu (comets ), the Rudras, Vasus and Adityas, sages and Bṛhaspati to confer happiness. Verse 12 prays to Indra, Brahmā, and all</p>

<p>the gods for refuge to the composer of the hymn and 13 declares that whatever things were appeased (by śāntis) in this world these the seven sages know. May they all be happiness for me; may happiness be mine and may freedom from fear be mine', Verse 14 which is similar to Vāj. S. 36.17 declares that the earth, mid-regions, heaven, waters, trees and plants, all gods-these have become appeased and auspicious by the śānti rites performed by the composer and that by those śāntis, by all śāntis I (we) appease ( remove the evil effect of) what is here terrible, what is cruel ( or inauspicious ), what is evil; may all that be appeased, be beneficial and happy for us ' 1137 Atharva 19. 10 (verses 1-10) contains the word &lsquo;sam&rsquo; 51 times and prays for welfare to soveral gods and 19. 11 is also a śānti containing the word &lsquo;śam&rsquo; 18 times. The Vājasaneya-samhitā chapter 36 ( verses 8-12) similarly contain the word &lsquo;sam&rsquo; several times. One of these viz. ( Vāj. S. 36. 12 ) occurs in many Vedic texts 1138 &ldquo;May the divine waters confer on us happiness, help and protection; may they flow towards us for our our happiness and welfare'.</p>
<p>In the Tai. S. the words &lsquo;samayati&rsquo; and &lsquo;śānti&rsquo; are fre quently used oftea in the same passage or context. For example, it is said &ldquo;Rudra 1139 is the fierce ( or harsh ) one among gods&hellip;; He ( the priest) does as it were a harsh thing when he recites (that passage containing the word) Rudra; &lsquo;in the path of Mitra&rsquo; he says for the sake of appeasing&rdquo;. There is a similar passage in the Ait. Br. While prescribing the recital of a sk Verse (Rg. II, 33. 1) in the Āgnimāruta-sastra the Ait. Br. changes the original words of the latter half of the verse in the Rgveda and also suggests another verso altogether for recital</p>

<p>( I. 43. 6 &lsquo;śani naḥ karatyarvate sugani mosāya mesye nrbhyo nāribhyo gave&rsquo;) because in the first place that verse begins with the auspicious word &lsquo;sam&rsquo; and in the second place because that verse, though the derala ( deity) thereof is Rudra, does not expressly mention that word; the result, says the Ait. Br., is that that verse being one of appeasement (śānti) the priest secures long life and procures long life for the sacrificer,</p>
<p>Another example of &lsquo;samayati in the Tai. S. is as follows : When an anihotrin is going on a journey with his houschold ho should offer homa to Vastospati, but if he goes without offering a homa to Vāstospati evil consequencos follow; &lsquo;Rudra is indeed Vāstospati; if he were to go out without offering homa to Vāstospati, Agni would become Rudra, would leap after him and kill him; (but) when he offers to Vastospati, he appeases him (Rudra-Agni) with his own share and the sacrificer meets no injury (or distress ):1140</p>
<p>Another example of &lsquo;śāmayati&rsquo; and &lsquo;santi&rsquo; in the Tai. S. (VI. 3. 3. 2–3 ) may be set out. &lsquo;O tree! protect it; O axe! do not harm it; the axe indeed is a thunderbolt; (therefore he utters those words ) for allaying ( the fierce power of the axe); these worlds are afraid of the tree ( of which the yūpa is made ) when it moves; ( therefore he recites &lsquo;with thy top do not graze the sky, with thy middle do not harm the atmospheric region&rsquo;. ( By these words ) he appeases ( removes the terrible power for evil of) this tree&rsquo;, 1141</p>
<p>The foregoing passages are quite sufficient for showing the significance attached to the words &lsquo;śam&rsquo;, &lsquo;samayati&rsquo; and &lsquo;śānti&rsquo; in the Vedic samhitās. The word &lsquo;santama&rsquo; occurs in the Rgveda about two dozen times. It is applied to the great gods like Agni, Indra, Soma (I. 16.7, I. 77.2, IX. 104,3), to the praises of gods (I. 76. 1, VI. 32. 1), to the worshipper or singer ( VIII. 13. 22 ), to protection by gods (1.76.3, X. 15. 4) and generally means &lsquo;beneficent or conferring happiness&rsquo;.

<p>The meaning of samayati</p>
<p>23</p>
<p>larly, the word &lsquo;santāti&rsquo; (Rg. I. 112. 20, VIII, 18.7) means &ldquo;beneficent&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The causal ( samayati) of the verb &lsquo;sam&rsquo; and the word</p>
<p>• śānti&rsquo; do not occur in the Rgveda, but they are as said above frequently employed in the Taittiriya and other Sambitās and in the Brāhmaṇas. Some further examples may be set out here. The Tai, S. relates the following legend &ldquo;Agni was in the yonder world (heaven), the sun was in this world; these worlds were (then) unappeased ( disturbed). The gods said &lsquo;come, let us change ( transpose) these two&rsquo;. They placed Agni in this world with the words &lsquo;O Agni, come here for the dainty meal&rsquo; and (placed) the Sun in the yonder world with the worlds &lsquo;the great and powerful one, O Agni&rsquo;; then indeed these two worlds became free from disturbance. Since he repeated those words in this way, it served for the purpose of quieting these worlds that were once disturbed ). These worlds became undisturbed ( auspicious) for him who knows this &ldquo;.1112 Here we have both the verbal form &lsquo;aśāmyatāma&rsquo; (from &lsquo;sam&rsquo; 4th conj.) and the the word &lsquo;śāntyai&rsquo;.</p>
<p>In some passages of the Roveda the word &lsquo;sami&rsquo; occurs ( as in I. 87.5, II. 31. 6, III, 55.3, VIII. 45. 27, X. 40, 1.). It is generally interpreted by Sāyana in these passages as the locative singular of śami&rsquo;, which is explained to mean &lsquo;karman&rsquo;(action, sacrifice or the like). Two of these may be cited here 1143 &ldquo;my desires fly in many directions; I shall brighten ancient (lauds ) towards &lsquo;sami&rsquo; (for employing them in various sacrifices ? ); knowing the truth in Turvaṣa (king) and Yadu (king) he (Indra) enveloped Ahnavāyya (their enemy) in warlike action.&rdquo;. It is possible to take &lsquo;sami&rsquo; as the locative singular of &lsquo;sam&rsquo; treated as a noun. The word &lsquo;sami&rsquo; occurs in many passages of the Roveda (I. 20.2, I. 83. 4, I. 110. 4, II. 1. 9, III. 60. 3, IV. 3, 4, IV, 17. 18, IV. 22. 8, IV. 33. 4, V. 77, 4, V. 42. 10, VI. 3. 2, VI. 52. 1, VIII. 75. 14, 1X. 74. 7, X. 28. 12).

<p>Sāyaṇa interprets it as &lsquo;karma&rsquo; and not as the &lsquo;sami tree or branch&rsquo;. But in one place at least (if not in more places) the word sami can easily be held to mean &lsquo;the sami wood or fuel stick &lsquo;. 11+ &ldquo;To that mortal wlio worships with sacrifices and appeases with &lsquo;samis&rsquo; (saml fuel-sticks) and gives offerings to Agni that abounds in wealth disappointment as to glory never comes nor does sin nor arrogance overtake him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The whole of chapter 36 of the Vājasaneya-sarhitā is employed as sānti at the beginning and end of the Pravargya rite, according to Kāt. Sr. S. 26. 11 &lsquo;śīntikaranain-ūdyantayoh&rsquo;; verses 9-12 of Vāj. S. 36 employ the word &lsquo;sim&rsquo; 17 times and verse 9 is the same as Rgveda I. 90. 9.</p>
<p>An interesting text in connection with the root san&rsquo; is the adhrigu praiṣu, to be recited by tho Hot! priest before the paśu is killed in a sacrifice. Vide H. of Dh. vol. II. p. 1121 note 2504 for the formula which is rather long. The important 115 words for the present purpose are at the beginning and at the end &lsquo;O divine slayers and human slayers I begin (the process of killing the pasu). &hellip;O Adhrigu! you should slay (the pasu) in such a way that it would be properly carried out&rsquo;. Here the root (sam ) certainly means to slay; this meaning is, however, apparently quite different from the one so far con sidered (viz, to appease, to remove evil effects). But it may be that there is a secondary meaning, viz. appease the gods by offering parts of the animal killed in the sacrifice.</p>
<p>The Taittirlya-brāhmaṇa closely connects the sami tree or branch with the conjuring away or appeasing the terrible or angry aspects of deities in the following myth : 1146 &ldquo;Prajapati</p>

<p>Legends about sami tree</p>

<p>created Agni; he (Prajāpati) became afraid this Agni might burn me&rsquo;. He (Prajāpati) pacified (the terrible flame or glow of) Agni with śami (branch); that is the beneficent or happy aspect i of śami in that the equipment required for Agni is full of sami in order to appease Agni and for freedom from being burnt thereafter.&rsquo; The idea is that Agni, the moment it was created had a fierce and evil aspect, that was removed by the use of the sami and śānti means an action or rite that appeases the evil aspects of a deity and makes the deity beneficent. Similarly, the Aitareya-brāhmana says:1147 &ldquo;Ho recites the verse they worship you with offerings whatever abodes you may have;&hellip;he says: 0 Soma! move towards houses in such a way as not to kill the sons (of the sacrificer).' Houses are indeed called</p>
<p>duryā' and the house of the sacrificer is afraid of the king Soma when he approaches the sacrificer&rsquo;s house; when he (the priest) repeats this (verse ) he thereby appeases him (king Soma) by a śānti ( propitiatory rite); ue (Soma ) becoming beneficent ( by the respetition of the mantra ) does not kill the progeny or the cattle ( of the sacrificer).&rdquo; The idea is that king Soma might be angry with the sacrificer if there be any defect in the sacri ficial rite and that when the hotṛ priest repeats the verse &lsquo;aviraha o-&rsquo; that verse is the cause of appeasement.</p>
<p>In the Satapatha-brāhmaṇa there is a similar reference to the appeasing power of the sami branch. “He (the priest ) places fuel sticks on this (Agni). &hellip; He places (on Agui) a fuel stick of saml as the first. This ( Agni) was kindled when this oblation (of sami branch) was offered and flamed upwards. The gods became afraid of him ( Agni) lest Agni might harm them. They (gods) saw this sami branch and appeased him ( Agni) with that; inasmuch as they appeased this (Agni) by means of sami ( branch) this is called sami. In the same way this sacrificer appeases with sami this (Agni) for procuring appeasement and not for food&rdquo;&lsquo;1118. It would be noticed</p>

<p>that here the name sami' is derived from the root &lsquo;sam&rsquo; and it is the means of effecting śānti ( appeasement ).</p>
<p>In the Brāhmaṇas the means of appeasement are various but simple. Often times the recitation of a Vedic verse or hymn effects śānti. For example, the Taittiriya-brāhmaṇa 1119 prescribes the singing of sānans at the time of consecrating the sacred srauta fires; the three stīms are Rathantara, Vāmadevya and Bșhat, each being connected with tho three worlds respec tirely. “When Agni is being takon out, he sings the Vāmadevya sāman; Vāmadevya is the atmospheric region and thereby (i.e. by singing lamadevya) he makes Agni establishod in the atmospheric region; Vimadevya is śinti (means of bring ing about the appeasement of Agni); (on singing Vārnadevya ) he takes out Agni that has become appeasod ( beneficent) and as bestower of cattle&rdquo;. The Tai. S. says 1150&rdquo; he says &lsquo;weave yo with regular measure the work of the singers&rsquo;. Whatever super fluity (or flaw) is committed in the sacrilico, this (recitation ) serves to eradicate its evil effects&rdquo;. The Ait. Br. provides &ldquo;(the priest) who is about to sprinkle holy water over him 1151 (the king) should (himself first recite the mantra and) make the king repeat it (after him)&lsquo;O Wators! look on me with &amp; beneficent eye, (and) touch my skin with (your) beneficent body. I invoke all the Agnis that dwell in waters for your sake; this should be done for the purpose that waters ( the evil aspects of which have been ) not appeased may not destroy the vigour of him who is being sprinkled over&rdquo;. The Hotr performs a jupa before and after reciting the sūmulleni verses. About this the Śānkhāyana-brābmana says1152 that the sāmidhenis are a thun</p>

<p>Water also is declared as a means of effecting the removal or appeasement of evil effects. The Ait. Br. remarks 1153 &quot; they say what is the atonement (prayascitti) if a person&rsquo;s sacrificial material (milk or rice ) when put on a fire for cooking spurts out or overflows? (The reply is) &lsquo;he should make it go down with water for the sake of śānti; water indeed is (a means of ) śānti and then he should touch the material (that has fallen out) with his right hand and recite a mantra ( that is specified) or he should recite another rk verse by whose power the worlds are made fixed&rsquo;, which is addressed to Viṣnu and Varuṇa; Viṣnu indeed is the saviour against what is badly sacrificed (i. o. the defects in it), while Varuna protects (i. e. prevents obstacles to securing the fruit of ) what is well sacrificed; (this latter mantra is recited) for śānti in regard to both ( defects as well as good points). This is the prāyaścitti in this case.&rdquo; It should be noticed that here sānti (rite) and prāgascitti are identified. The Saṅkhāyana.1151 Br. also (III. 6) says “waters are (means of) śānti, (they are ) an antidote and therefore after pronouncing the word &lsquo;vaṣat&rsquo; the priest touches water.&rdquo; In the Tai. Ār. (IV. 42 ) there are 37 mantras of śānti used in the Pravargya rite. Some of these occur in the Rgveda-samhita. e. g. the 8th ( Vata. a. vatu bhesajam) is Rg. X. 186. 1, mantras 15-17 are equal to Rg. IV. 31. 1-3; mantras 22-24 are Rg. X.9.1-3. The same Aranyaka ( IV. 26-35) and Baud. Sr. S.

<p>History of Dharnasāstra</p>
<p>(Seo. III, Ch. XX</p>
<p>mahālira (in Pravargya rite ) of the hot milk for the Gharma offering were to be stolen by a thief, one should offer in the Gārbapatya fire an oblation of ghee with the stura ladle to the accompaniment of the mantra “May Day and Night disclose thee as thief&rdquo;. &ldquo;If a wild 1156 forest dog were to bark ( while the Pravargya rite is on), the priest should repeat by way of a magic forinula the text &lsquo;vi gā Indra vicaran spāśayasra&rsquo; (O Indra, observe the cows while you more about&rsquo;), should cast a kindled firebrand on both sides with the words &lsquo;O Agni, converse with Agni, and then he worships Agni with the words &lsquo;O Agni, salutation to thee once, twice, thrice &amp;c.&rsquo; If a vulture screeches he recites the formula &lsquo;you are undistinguishablo (from other birds ) since you have blood in your beak&rsquo;, if an owl or she-owl hoots he recites the mantra &lsquo;In this way the owl approaches &amp;c.&rsquo;. Therefore it may be said that sānti is used in the early Vedic texts in several senses viz. (1) the state of being freed from evil aspects or effects, (2) means of appoasing or removing evil aspects, such as water, a Vedic verse or hymn, (3) rite for appeasement.</p>
<p>Apart from the simple śāntis for appeasing deities in sacri. ficial matters, even the Rgreda contains indications that there were other occurrences which were thought to be unlucky and against the supposed evil effects of which some remedies were employed. For example, Rg. X. 164 11-5) is a hymn declarod by the Anukramapi and Rgvidhāna IV, 20.1 as counteracting the indications of bad dreams.: 137 Verse 3 of it is &lsquo;May Agni place far away from us all evil and undesirable actions which we may have done while awake or asleep whether by our desires or imprecations or want of desire&rsquo;.

<p>poet prays &lsquo;O God Savitpl today produce for us welfare ondowed with progeny and frighten away the effects of bad dreams; O God Savitṣ! drive away all sins (or evils) and confer on ug what is beneficent&rsquo; (or auspicious). In Rg. II. 28. 10 the poet prays &lsquo;O king Varuṇa! whoever, whether a helper or a friend, declares to me who ascertained a danger (from what I saw) in a dream or whoever, a thief or a wolf, intends to harm me, from that guard us&rsquo;. In Ry. VIII, 47.15 the sage exclaims &lsquo;we deliver all our bad dreains to Trita Āptya; your kindness cannot be obstructed by any one, the protection given by you is good&rsquo;. Vide also Rg. VJII. 47. 14, 16-18, X. 36. 4, X. 37, 4 for bad dreams. Similarly, the Rgved contains verses which show that cries of birds were deemed to indicate coming good or evil and the hooting of the owl was thought to be unlucky. &lsquo;It 1159 (the bird ) frequently cries and proclaims what is to come and it propels bis speech as an oarsman propels a boat; O bird! May you be auspicious to us; may no overpowering (or unfavourable) phenomenon reach you from any side&rsquo;. The three verses of Rg. II. 43 refer to the cries of birds. &ldquo;The birds, chirping, utter cries towards the south of the house) like composers of songs that speak for food at various seasons; O bird! when you chirp, speak what would be to our welfare, when you are silent think of good thoughts about us; when flying up (from our house ) you utter (cries) like a lute; may we be endowed with valiant sons and speak much in assemblies&rsquo;. Rg. X. 165 contains several verses about a kapota bird and one about an owl. Rg.

If a man sees any one of these, he should fast, cook a dish of rice in milk in a vessel, offer into fire oblations thereof with each of the verses of the hymn to Night (Rg. X 127.1-8), feed brāhmaṇas with other food (cooked in the house) and should himself eat boiled rice'1161 The same Āraṇyaka mentions in the same context some unusual phenomena such as the sun appearing like the moon ( pale and without heat) or the sky becoming like madder and prescribes the recital of some Rgvedic verses ( such as IX. 67. 21–27, VIII, 6. 30, IX. 113. 6-11, I. 50. 10).</p>

<p>The Apastamba-gļhya (8. 23.9) lumps together several unusual appearances and provides the same śānti in the case of all, &lsquo;If the post of a man&rsquo;s house puts forth shoots, or if honey is made in his house by bees or if the footprint of a pigeon is seen on the hearth or if disease arises in his family, or in the case of other miracles and prodigies, let him perform on the newmoon night, at dead of night, at a place where he does not hear the sound of water, the rites from the putting of wood on the fire to the Ajualhūmre olilations indicated in the next (Apas tambiyamantrapitha II.31. 14-23), and then perform Jaya and following oblations.&rsquo; Very similar provisions are found in Jaiminiya-grhya 11. 7.1169 The Sāmavidhanabrāhmana contains several prāyaścittas ( really sîntis) on the happening of numerous incidents. A few examples are set out here ; when bad dreams1170 are soen, the person should make repetition of Rg. V. 82.4 twice (i. e. in all at least six times); in the case of any other prognosticatory occurrence not known from any work the person should repeat twice the verse Rg. IV. 31.1.

In Il. 2.2 The Sāmavidhāna Br. prescribes a śānti for one seized or posessed by an evil spirit. A portion of Şadrimsabrāhmaṇa (viz. V. 1-10) is styled Adbhuta brāhmaṇa and contains sāntis for several kinds of utpātas. Some parts of it (such as V.2-3) correspond with Āśvalāyana-gļhya -pariśiṣta, 4. 11-15. The Sadvinnsa-brāhmana V.7. 2. provides for earthquakes and cracks in palaces, which are similar to Yoga yātrā 3. 13. The Atharrareda 19.9. 9 refers to showers of fall ing stars (naksatramulkābhihatam sam-astu naḥ) and Sad vimśa V. 9. 2. refers to falling ineteors and V. 10. 2. to images laughing, weeping &amp;c.</p>
<p>Reasons of space forbid further description of śāntis from the grhya-sūtras.</p>
<p>The preceding discussion with regard to sāntis is enough to show that sāntis were prescribed in the Vedic literature, th:7 srautasūtras, Samaridhāna-brāhmana and Rgvidhāna, not only for appeasing the angry divinities or powers of evil, but also for occurrences like bad dreams or of portentous phenomena like the sun&rsquo;s or moon&rsquo;s appearance, the cries of unlucky birds &amp;c.</p>
<p>This subject about śāntis against all sorts of omens and portents was very much elaborated in the post-Vedic literature. An extensive literature on sintis exists in the Gṛbyasūtras, the Kausika-sūtra, the Atharvareda Parisistas (particularly Nos. V, XXXI on Kotiloma, XXXIII on Ghrtakambala, XXXVII on &lsquo;gamuccayaprāyascittam&rsquo;, resembling 13th chapter of Kausika, LVIII to LXVII on utpātas, adbhutaśāntis and dreams, LXXI and LXXII, the Purānas (like Matsya 92–93 and 228-238, Visnu. dharmottara I. 90–105, II. 124-127, II. 159-164.

Of these the Adbhutasāgara is a very extensive work of 751 pages, edited by Pandit Murlidhar Jha and published by Prabhakari &amp;c, Banares, in 1905 A. D. The Kștyakalpataru on Sāntis has not yet been edited and published in the Gaikwad Oriental Series. As compared with some other kūndas, the section on śānti is meagro. It deals only with the following; Kūrmavibhāga (the distribution of the countries in Bhārata in 9 groups); Graha-makha or Grahayāga quoting Yāj. I. 295–308, Matsya, Narasimha and Bhavisya and Davipurāna; Ayutahoma, Kotihoma; Pusyasnāna; Grabaśānti; Mātrśānti; Lingaśānti; Vināyakaśānti (quoting Yāj.

It is neither possible nor necessary to deal with this vast mass on śānti in this work in detail.

Therefore, only a few śāntis now in vogue or very interesting from several viewpoints will be dealt with in this section. 1172</p>

Gravenhage, 1951) on &lsquo;Saati&rsquo; deals at some length only with śāntis in the Sambitās, Brāhmaṇas and Srautasūtras, According to keśava&rsquo;s Paddhati on Kausika-sūtra (I 8; Bloomfield&rsquo;s ed. p. 307) and Sāyaṇa in bis Iatro, to Atharvaveda there were five Kalpas of the Atharvaveda mentioned by (an ancient commentator) Upavarsa in his commentary on Jaimini 1.3. 11-14 called Kalpasūtrādbikarana viz. 977069, FETECH, MATCU, 3miṣthey and शान्तिकल्प. सायण says (Muradabad edition of samvat 1986) &lsquo;शान्तिकल्पेपि प्रथमं वैनायकग्रहगृहीतलक्षणानि तच्छान्तये सम्भाराहरणम्, अभिषेकवैनायकहोमाः, तत्पूजा ROUTE, 112cuur TEETTIERIAI (p 81, and p. 28 of Pandit&rsquo;s ed.), gr ORTATE XLIX ( turung p. 337, 4. 7).

<p>The subjects treated of in the Madanaratna (about 1425 to 1450 A. D.) on Santika-paustika would indicate how extensive was the cult of śāntis recommended in medieval times. The Anukramaṇikā at the beginning of the Ms. montions the follow ing: Vināyakasnāna; śāntis to placate the nine planets from the Sun to Ketu: Sanaiscarytata; śāntis to placate Saturn extracted from Skanda ( Nāgarakhandi and Prabhāsakhanda); worship of Jupiter and Venus; Sāntis based on the Yāmalas 117.4 on the conjunction of five or more planets; Grahasnānas froin Visaudharmottara; śāntis of the tithi and weekday when fever and other diseases seize a man; Nakśatraśānti; śāntis for the nine naksatras called Janma and the rest (vide note 772 for these nine nakṣatras); sintis for birth on Amārāsyā, or on Mūla, Āśleṣā or Jyesthā naksatra; santi for birth on the same naksatra as that of the father or (elder) brother; sāntis for birth on Ganda, Vaidhrti, Vyatipātayoga, Saṅkranti, Visanādi, ecplipses; sānti called Gomukhaprasava; sāntis declared for the protection of the foetus from the first and following months from conception: huli offerings; medicine for removing pains of the foetus; measures for easy delivery; for protection of the child after birth; bali on first day with mantras &amp;c.; nīrājana &amp;c., description of sprinkling the infant with holy water, satiating gods and pitrs with water, homas, yrıntras (mystical diagrams);</p>
<p>1172a, The Yamalas are works of Tantra class, the numbers of which are variously given. But they are oftco said to be cight. Vide note 1598 below on tantras. The Rudrayāmala tantra was published by Jivananda containing over 6000 verses in 66 chapters in 1892. There are works called Ganesayāmala, Brabmayāmala, Kudra-yamala, Viṣnuyāmala, Sakti-yāmala, and several others. Certain glatis (or nādis) of certain tithis, weekdays and naksatras 3rc said by the Smṛti-kaustubha to be viṣanādis or viṣaghatis (producing very disastroos results ), but in astrological works certain ghaṭis of naksatras only have that appella tion and a person born on those gbatis forebodes the death and loss of the father, the mother, wealth and himself by poisoning, arms agd missiles (according to Dharmasindhu p. 184). The Jadanaratna on Santika (folios 15b to 20b) sets out oumerous details about all the 27 aaksatras from the work of Atreya, one (detail) being the visaghaṭi of each nakgatra e. g. as to Aøvini three nādikās after 50th gbaṭikā constitute visanādi, as to Bharani one gbaṭi after 24, as to Punarvasu and Pusya one ghaçi aftor 30 and 20 gbaṭis respectively and so on,</p>

As the rivers day and night pour their sediment (clay or mud carried by them ) in the sea without fail, similarly may all tribes (of gods ? ) with one mind approach my invocation (or sacri. fice ) without fail; may the Goddess (Earth) along with all deities be firm and unmoving for me and may (the Goddess ) drive away from us all evil and pierce my enemies that hate me.&rdquo; After having offered oblations with the words &lsquo;svāhā to the earth&rsquo; he swould offer oblations with the verses Atharva VI. 87. 1, VI. 88.1 and with the verses of the anurūka beginning with Atharva XII, 1. 1.

<p>portentous&rsquo;. For example, according to Nirukta I. 5 1180 the . sage Agastya first promised to offer an offering to Indra, but later he desired to offer the same to the Maruts, that then Indra came to Agastya and complained to him as in Rg.

<p>Meaning of adbhuta, utpāta and nimitta</p>
<p>what will happen in future! Yāska paraphrases &lsquo;adbhuta&rsquo; by the word &lsquo;abhūta&rsquo; (that has not taken place) and remarks that the word &lsquo;adbhuta&rsquo; in popular speech also means &lsquo;something that has not happened before&rsquo;. Rg. I. 25. 11 1181 says the intelligent man expects from this (Varuṇa) all wonders (or portentous happenings ), whether already performed or to be performed&rsquo;. Rg. X. 105.7 is perhaps a little clearer than the preceding. &lsquo;(May Indra reduce our sins) Indra who is golden bearded, who has tawny horses, whose jaw is never broken and who made against the dasynı for easily killing him a thunder bolt like the sky that is wonderful (or full of portents)&rsquo;. The word usually employed in the Gșhyasūtras is adhluta and the śāntis are called &lsquo;adbhutaśāntis&rsquo;. Adbhuta is a word of very general import. It includes not only such serious phenomena as earth-quakes, eclipses, comets, falling stars but such compara tively minor yet unexpected or unusual happenings as a cow yielding blood-red milk or a cow sucking the udder of another COW. The ancient writer Viddha-Garga defines &ldquo;adbhuta&rsquo; as any occurrence that had not occurred before or a total change coming over what has occurred before.1182 The 67th Ātharvana pariṭiṣta is called Adbhutaśānti (pp. 432-435). It distributes &lsquo;adbhutas&rsquo; into seven groups relating to Indra, Varuna, Yama, Agni, Kubora, Viṣnu and Vāyu and names some adbhutas under each such as a rainbow at night (relating to Indra), a vulture or owl alighting on a man&rsquo;s house or a kapota entering it (relating to Yama), smoke without fire (relating to Agni), eclipse on the nakṣatra of a man&rsquo;s birth (relating to Viṣnu) and prescribes as śānti the japa of Atharvasiras, making brāhmaṇas say &lsquo;svasti,&rsquo; honouring and feeding brāhmaṇas. That parisista is based on the Adbhutabrāhmana of the Simayeda.</p>

<p>select a learned, well-conducted brāhmana as his purohila, provides that the king should give heed to what astrologers and interpreters of omens tell (him) and that the purohita should perform śānti rites, rites for prosperity (such as vastu-homa) and magic rites (on behalf of the king 1183). But in the Purānas and the medieval Sanskrit works it is far more frequent than the word adbhuta; sometimes cuibhūta and !/pāla are used as synonyms. Garga says 11si ' deities become unfavourable owing to the wrong doings of nien and create extraordinary happen ings in the sky, atmospheric region and on the earth. These are the utpātas for all worlds created by gods; these utpātas sally forth for the destruction (of peuplu ) and they by their (terrific) appearances rouse people (to do what is proper.). Here the words &lsquo;adbhuta&rsquo; and &lsquo;utpata&rsquo; are used as synonyms. Similarly, Matsya (228. 1-2) appears to regard the two words as synonyms. 1185 Generally, however, the wird utpāta denotes</p>
<p>ccurrences that portend evil to all. Amarakora treats &lsquo;ajanya&rsquo;, &lsquo;utpata&rsquo; and &lsquo;upasarga&rsquo; as synonyms. Utpata is defined by Garga, Varahamihira1166 and Atharra-parisista LXIV as the</p>

<p>Nimitta and utpūta</p>
<p>743</p>
<p>roverse of the usual natural order. Nimitta means, according&rdquo;, to Amarakosa (nimittam hetulaksmanoh) &lsquo;cause or prognostic. sign&rsquo;. Nimitta may be auspicious or inauspicious. This is one distinction between utpāta (which generally denotes an unlucky. portent) and nimitta. There is another distinction. Nimitta is often restricted to the throbbing of a person&rsquo;s limbs (as in Matsya chap.241), though here and there it is used in a wider sense as in Gita. (I. 31) ( nimittani ca pasyami viparitani Kesava&rsquo;OKesava! I see adverse omens), Ramayana, Ayodhyan. kanda. 4.17-19, Bhisma-parva2. 16-17, Virata 46. 30, Atharva parisista LXIV (Utpata-laksana) 10.9-10. 1187 It may be noted that Manu VI. 50 mentions &lsquo;utpāta&rsquo; and &lsquo;nimitta&rsquo; separately (p. 527 note 758).</p>
<p>Examples of unfavourable happenings (nimittas or utpātas) occur plentifully in the Mahabharata, Sabhāparva 80.28-31, 81. 22-25, Vanaparva 179. 41, 224. 17-18, Virata .39. 4-6, 46. 24-32, Udyoga. 84.4-9, 156.28-30, Bhisma 2.17-33,3.65-74, 19. 36-38,99.21-28, 112.6-13, Drona 7. 34-41, 77.3-7, Salya 23.21-24, 56.8-14, 192. 17-21, Mausala. 1. 1-5, 2. 1-17 and the Ramayapa, Ayodhya 4. 17-19, Aranyakanda 23. 1-7 and 10-25, Yuddhakanda 10. 14-20, 23. 4-11, 35. 25-35, 41. 13-20, 53. 32, 65.47-51,95. 43,96. 40-41.

The auspicious signs described in the epics, are comparatively fow as in Balakāṇda 22.4, Udyoga $3, 23-26, 84. 117, Bhiṣma 3. 65–74, Śānti 52. 25, Āśvamedhika 53, 5-6. The principal auspicious signs are: clear sky Tithout clouds, wind blowing 1188 cool and pleasant to the skin, no dust raised, birds and animals proceeding to a man&rsquo;s right side, fire without being enveloped in smoke and with flames turned towards the right, shower of flowers, auspicious birds like ıxm, krans, peacock sending up chirpings to the right ( Karna 72. 12-13).</p>
<p>The omens and portents mentioned in the two epics are generally described as occurring at certain important timon and events, e. g. on the eve of battles or when Dasaratha proposed that Rāma be crowned as yurarūjr, or when Pāpdavas startad on their exile into the forest or when Bbisma was anointed as commander-in-chief of the Kaurava hosts or when Arjuna vowed that he would kill Jayadratha before sunset.

<p>uttered in the same breath with eclipses. But Garga, 1189 Parasara, Sabha-parva, Brhatsamhita 45. 2,Matsyapurapa 229.5, Atharva-parisista LXIX (1.2) and other works divide utpatas into three classes, viz. divya (arising from heavenly bodies), ūntariksa (springing in the sky or atmospheric region) and bhauma (that appear on the earth). This classification is ancient enough. The Atharvaveda. 1190_expressly refers to the three classes of utpātas ‘May the earthly and atmospheric utpātas and the planets moving in heaven confer welfare on us&rsquo;. The Brhatsamhita. 1191 says that it is the king&rsquo;s business to arrange for śāntis in his kingdom for counteracting (the consequences of portents). Garga 1192 doclared that those who, when advised by brāhmaṇas for performing śāntis, perform auspicious rites with faith do not suffer defeat, but that those who having po faith or because of atheism or resentment do not perform rites for counteracting (omens) perish in a short time. Garga, the Brhatsamhita, Matsya 229. 6-9, Agni 263. 12-13 furnish examples of the three kinds of utpātas, 1193 viz. the divya ones are concerned with the abnormal conditions of planets and naksatras, eclipses, comets; those of atmospheric regions are hurricanes, unusual clouds, fall of meteors, twilights, preternatural reddish appearances of the quarters, halo, Fata Morgana (appearance of illusory town in the air), rainbow and strange rainfall (such as</p>

<p>of blood-red water, or fall of rain with fishes, tortoises &amp;c.); those of the earth are earth-quake and unusual states of water reservoirs. The Brhatsambitā remarks that the evil conse quences of earthly (bhaumu) utpūtas when counteracted with śāntis are removed, the evil consequencos of utpātas from the atmospheric regions are reduced to a mild form ( by śāntis), while, according to somo (icāryas like Kāśyapa, says Utpala) divya utpātas are not counteracted by śāntis at all; the opinion of Varāhamihira himself appears to be that the consequences of even dilya utpātas are conjured away by the gifts of plenty of gold, food, cows and land and by spilling the milk of cows on the ground or in a Rudra temple and be performing kritihoma. Varāhamihira and Matsya further provide that daiva utpāta has evil effects (lit. bears fruit) in eight ways, viz. on the king himself, his son, his treasury, his converancos (horses, elephants &amp;c,), his capital, his queen, purobita and his people.1191</p>
<p>Numerous śāntis bearing different names are prescribed in Matsya, by Varāhamibira and others.

Abhaya-śānti is prescribed when a king desires to be a conqueror or when he is attacked by enemies or when he fears that witchcraft has been practised against him or when he desires to uproot his enemies or when a great danger threatens. The Saluun yn śānti is prescribed when a man is attacked by Tuberculosis or is weak owing to wounds or when a man desires to perform a sacrifice. When there is an earthquake or when there is a famine of food or there is excessive rain or drought or there is danger of locysts or when thieves are operating the Vuiṣnuri śānti is prescribed; Raudri sānti is employed against an epidemic among cattle or human beings or when ghosts appear or when a coronation is to take place or when there is fear of an invasion or there is treachery in one&rsquo;s kingdom, or when enemies are to be killed; Brūhmi śānti is performed when it is feared that Veda study would</p>

<p>The Agnipurāna (263. 7-8) refers to these 18 śāntis and says that the best śāntis are Amṛtā, Abhayā and Saumyā. Varahamihira mentions numerous śāntis on the happenings of several abnormal incidents. For reasons of space nothing can be said here about them. But one śānti deserves to be set out. 1195 *If a man perceives Yaksas, the astrologer should declare that an epidemic is very near; for counteracting them Garga per formed a propitiatory rite, viz. Mahāśāntis, offerings, plentiful food, worship of Indra and Indrāṇi.&rsquo; The Bṛhatsambitā sets out ( 45. 82-95) certain happenings as not portentous when they happen in certain seasons and quotes several verses of Rṣiputra which also occur in Matsya 229. 14-25 with some variations;</p>
<p>. g. in Caitra and Vaiśākha the following are auspicious (and not portents requiring śānti) lightning, meteors, earthquake, blazing twilight, noisy storms, halo, dust in sky, smoke in forests, rod sunrise and sunset.</p>

<p>Individual śāntis</p>
<p>It is now time to turn to individual śāntis, mostly post-vedic. The first is Vināyaka-śānti or Ganapatipūjā. This is perfornied at the commencement of all samskāras such as u punajanı and marriage in order that the fruit thereof may be had without obsta cles or for averting the evil effects of portents or in order to mitigato the adverse effects of the death of a sapinda or the like. When it is performed for its own sake it should be performed on the 4th tithi of the bright halt, on Thursday ild the auspicious naksatras Pusya, Sravana, Uttarī, Rohini, Lasti, Aśvini, Mrga</p>
<p>· śīrṣa, but when performed at the commencument of Upanayana or the like, one may perfurm it at time suited to the time of the principal rite. The sunluluu is given below. 11% In H. of Dh. vol. II pp. 213-216 it has been shown bow in the earliest stages represented by the Mānava-gruya and Baijavāpa-gshya which speak of four Vināyakas, all woru evil spirits, how in the next stage&rsquo; represented by the Yājñavalkyasmrti (1. 271–294). Vinayaka is not only represented as causing obstacles ( Vighna krt) but also as bringing success in all actions and rites (Vighnahrt) and how later on it was prescribed that Gapapati pūjā must be done first in all rites (Gobhila I, 13). Yāj. I. 293 provides 1197 that by worshipping Vināyaka in the way pres cribed and also the planets, a person socures success in his undertakings and the highest prosperity. The Viṣnudharmottara II. 105. 2-24 borrows the verses of Yuj. l. 71-292, though not in the same order and adds a fuw. &lsquo;l ho Brahmapda provides 1198</p>

<p>that Gajānana must be worshipped for success in all desires, in all samskūras such as Garbhādhāna and Jātakarma, when start ing on a journey or engaging in a commercial undertaking, at the time of battle, in the worship of gods, in troublous times. The Bhavisyottara chap. 144 has a śānti called Gananāthaśānti which resembles the Vināyakaśānti of Yāj.</p>
<p>In the Yājñavalkya-smrti (I. 294-308), the Vaikhānasa smārta-gūtra (IV. 13-14), the Baudhāyana-gļhyaśoṣasūtra, the Matsya-purāpa (93. 1-105), the Viṣnudharmottara I. 93–105 and other purānas, in the Bșhad-Yogayātrā (chap. 18. 1-24), and in the medioval digests provision is made for a śānti rite to the nine grahus, viz. the Sun, the Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, Saturn (mentioned in the order of the week-days), Rāhu and Ketu. This naruyrahasūnti is the model (prakļli) of all śānti homas in all medieval digests. The Vaikhānasa-smārtasūtra 1199 provides that all religious rites should be preceded by this naya graha-śānti. Yājižavalkya 1200 says one desirous of prosperity, of removing evil or calamities, of rainfall( for crops), long life, bodily health and one desirous of performing magic rites against enemies and others should perform a sacrifice to planets.&rsquo;t The Matsya (93.5-8) states that the narugrahamukla is of three kinds, viz Ayutahoma (in which 10000 oblations are made ), Lakṣahoma and Kotihoma. The first is described at length in Matsya 93.; 7-84, Laksahoma in 93. 85-118, Kotihoma in 93. 119-139. The Matsya further provides 1201 that Ayutaloma should be per formed in marriages, festivals, sacrifices, establishment of images and other rites, in order that no obstacles should arise therein and on occasions when the mind is perturbed or when some evil omen or unusual event happens.</p>

The Matsya 1202 (93. 11-12) prescribes that in drawing the images the Sun should be in the middle, that Mars, Jupiter, Mercury, Venus, Moon, Saturn, Rāhu and Ketu should be established with grains of rice respectively in the south, north, north-east, east, south-east, west, south-west and north-west.

The Viṣnudharmottara (I. 103. 1-6 ) contains the same fees. 1206 He should offer special worship to that planot that may be unfavourably situated ( as regards his nakṣatra or horoscope) at a particular time. Yāj. winds up by saying that the rise and fall of kings depend on planets (vide note 800 for this verse). Visnudharmottara (I. 106. 9–10) also has the same verse. Krtyakalpataru (on śāntika, folio 5 b) quotes Bhavisya to the effect that planets are always favourable to him who abstains from injury to others, who is self-restrained, who acquires wealth by righteous means, and who always observes the niļamas (restrictive rules of conduct as in Yāj. III. 313). The śāntimayūkha (p. 21) also quotes this verso.</p>
<p>The Vaikbānasasmārtasūtra (IV. 13) provides slightly different kinds of nairedya food for the nino planots (as in note 1205) and prescribes separate Vedic mantras for tho prosiding deities (of the planets) to whom oblations of ghee were to be offered. The Matsya remarks at the end of tho description of Ayutahoma: &lsquo;just as armour is a protection against the wounds by arrows, so śānti (graha-yajña) is protection against the strokes of Fate.&lsquo;1207</p>
<p>The Matsya (93.92) declares 1208 that Laksahoma is ten times of the Ayutahoma and Koṭihoma is one hundred times of Laksa homa in the matter of oblations, fees and rewards, that the pro cedure of invoking and bidding goodbye to the planets and presid ing deities, the mantras for homa, bath and gifts are the same in Lakṣahoma and Kotihoma.

<p>that &amp; sacrifice devoid of distribution of food burns (i. e. brings disasters on) the country, devoid of (proper) mantras burns the officiating priests, devoid of (proper) fees burns the sacrificer; there is no enemy as (disastrous as) a sacrifice and that a poor man should not start on a Laksahoma, since wrangling (about food or fees) in a sacrifice always causes trouble or misfortune (to the sacrificer). The Bṛhadyogayātrā of Varāha (chap. 18 verses 1-24) deals with grahayajsız and closely follows Yāj. though some details are added here and there. Verses about the sun are quoted below (n 1213). The Yogayātrā also (chap.6) deals with the same matter. The Agnipurāna (chap. 164) is a wholesale copy of Yāj. (I. 295–308). The Matsya (in chapter 239. again deals with Koṭi-homa which continues for a yoar. The Matsyapurāṇa (chap. 94) contains nine verses on the manner in which the figures of the nine planets were to be drawn or painted and these are quoted by the Mitāksarā on Yāj. I. 297-298 and by Krtyakalpataru (on śānti) folio 5a. Vide Kotihoma in list of vratas (p. 290 ).</p>
<p>The Grahayajña in Yāj. is short and simple, but in some purāpas such as the Bhavisyottara (141.6-85) and medieval and modern works it has become an elaborate affair by the addition of numerous details. One or two details may be pointed out. Each planet was supposed to have a gotra and was 1910 deemed to have been born in a certain country (vide note 875 p. 588 for the countries of the birth of planets). Therefore, in invoking the presence of each planet these two details have to be added ( as specified below in the note for the sun by way of illustra tion). The gotras of the grahas from the Sun to Ketu are respectively Kāśyapa, Atreya, Bhāradvāja, Atreya, Āngirasa, Bhārgava, Kāśyapa, Paithinasa, Jaimini. The Sainskāra-tattya of Raghunandana (p. 946 ) sets out from Skanda the gotras and countries of birth of the nine grabas and provides that if worship is offered to them without mentioning the gotras and countries that would be disrespectful to them.

<p>may be simple (kerala) as in Yāj. or Ayutahoma or Lakṣahoma or Kotihoma. A few further remarks are added here from the Agnipuarāṇa (chap. 149 ), Narasimha-purīna (chap. 35), Matsya (chap. 93 and 239 ), Bhavisyottara (chap. 141 and 142), Atharva parisista XXXI (for Kotihoma) and other works. The Krtyakalpataru 1211 (Rajdharma) quotes the Brahma-purāna as follows: The king should perform two Laksahomas every year and one Koṭihoma which confers freedom from the fear of all calamities and he should at once perform a Mahāśānti that removes all evil consequences when there are eclipses of the Sun and the Moon and an earthquake. The Agni ( 149.12) says &lsquo;Ayutahoma confors slight success, Laksahoma drives away all distress, while Kotihonia tends to destroy all kinds of trouble and confers all desirad objects. The Visnudharmottara (II. 36. 3-4 ) states that Asyapati, father of the fanious polirratū Savitri performed a Laksahoma with the Savitri (Ctiyatri) mantras for securing a son. There is no atpūln in the world that is not conjured away by Lakṣahoma; there is no more auspicious thing that surpasses Lakṣahoma. In the case of the king who gets a Kotihoma performed by brāhinanas the enemies cannot stand up against him in battle: excessive rainfall, drought, mice, locusts, parrots, evil spirits and the like and all enemies on the battle-field ara conjured away from him. &lsquo;1212 The Bhavi. syottara (142. 11-12) calls koṭihoma a sānti rite, which yields all desired objects, by which even grave sins like brahmana-murder are removed at once, all utpātas are conjured away and great happiness. follows. Bharisyottara (chap. 142. 7-54 ) contains an elaborate procedure of Koṭihoma and also a briefer one (in chap. 142. 56-80). Atharva-parisista (No. 31) describes the procedure of Koṭihoma; it was to be begun on an auspicious tithi in the bright half, on the mulūrla called Vijaya and on &lsquo;one of the naksatras viz. Rohiṇi, Pusya, Anuradhā, the three Uttarās, Abhijit, Mrgasiras, Sravana, Citri, Revati. The firepit was to be of eight cubits (for Laksahoma half of this ), the brāhmaṇas may be 20, 100, 1000 or even one crore, who</p>

For the Sun-Ruby, wheat, cow, red garment, jaggery, gold, copper, red sandalwood, lotuses; for the Moon-rice grains in veggel made from bamboo, camphor, pearl, white garment, jar full of ghee, a bull; for Mars-coral, wheat, masūra pulse, red bull, jaggery, gold, red garment, copper; for Mercury-blue garment, gold, bronze vessel, mulya pulse, emerald, slave girl, ivory, flowers; for Jupiter-topan, turmeric, sugar, horse, yellow corn and yellow garment, salt, gold; for Venus-garmont of various colours, white horse, cow, diamond, gold, silver, unguents, rice grains; for Saturn-sapphire, māsa beans, sesame and sesame oil, kulitthe (pulse ), she-buffalo, iron, dark cow; for Rāhu gomeda (a kind of gem of four varieties), horse, blue garment, blanket, sesame and sesame oil, iron; for Ketu-cat&rsquo;s eye gem, sesarne and sesame oil, blanket, musk, lamb, garnients. In the author&rsquo;s youth these directions about dānas (gifts ) were followed by many people and even now they are being followed to some extent. The Madanaratna (on Sāntika-paustika, folios 5 a to 7 a) gives separate śānti procedure for each of the grahas from the Sun to Ketu from the Bhavisyottara.</p>

<p>Anothor śīnti rolers to the placating of Saturn when that planet occupios the 12th, 1st and 2nd rūśis from the rāśi of a man&rsquo;s birth. This is rougbly a period of seven years and a half and is called &lsquo;sūrilha-apilar șiku-piya&rsquo; in Sanskrit and&rsquo;sīble sāli&rsquo; in Marāṭhi. The śānti consists in worshipping an image of Saturn made of iron placed in a vessel of iron or clay, covered with two dark garments or a blanket and offering to it dark and fragrant flowers, food or rice mixed with sesame. That food and tho image are to be donated to a dark brāhmana or to some brāhmaṇa with the mantra &lsquo;san no devir (Rg. X. 9. *). If the worshipper be a sūdra be is to repeat it paurānika 1211 mantra (notod below) which refers to Nala getting back his kingdom by placating Saturn. This should be done every Saturday for a year or one should every day repeat the mantra containing ten names of Saturn (in note 1214) and should also repeat a Sanistotra (eulogy of Saturn) every morning. By doing so the trouble that Saturn causes for seven and half years is arerted.</p>
<p>Some of the medieval digests try to furnish an accurato definition of Sānti. Only one inay be cited here. The Santi mayukha 1215 of Nilakantha (first half of 17th century A. D.) defines it as a rito prescribed by the sastra, which (rite ) has its motive or urge sinfulness that is not clear (i.e. that is only inferred or presumed), that removes evil etfects relating only to this world, and the performance of which does not lead on to sin</p>
<p>The first clauses excludes gifts made to remove diseases like tuberculosis; 1216 the 2nd clause distinguishes śāntis from sacri.</p>

<p>Definition of śānti</p>
<p>ht</p>
<p>fices (intended to socuro other worldly rowards) and prūyuscittas (that yield consoquences in this world as well as in the next) and the last clause distinguishes śāntis from rites of black magic (for destroying one&rsquo;s nemies or securing a married woman&rsquo;s love &amp;c.) which is sinful.</p>
<p>The number of śāntis is legion. They are prescribed for conjuring away the effects of rare natural phenomena such as eclipsos, earth-quakes, rainfall (of peculiar kinds, of blood &amp;c. ) hurricanes, fall of meteors, comets, halos, Fata Morgana; for protection against the evil effects of the positions and movements of planets and stars for the world and for individuals; for strange births among human beings and animals; for the good of horses and elephants; for certain untoward happenings about Indra&rsquo;s banner and about images of gods falling of weeping, the cries of birds and boasts, the fall of lizards and the like on a person&rsquo;s limbs and on certain stated periods or on solemn occasions.</p>
<p>All rites of Sānti, Paustika rites and the Mahādānas were to be performed in ordinary fire, since there is no authority to prove that they are to be performed in srauta fires or in smārta fire. Manu 3. 67 and Yāj. I. 97 refer only to ceremonies laid down in the Grhyasūtras. On Yāj. I, 285-86 the Mitaksarā prescribes ordinary fire for offerings in Vinayaka-śānti. Vide also Santi. mayūkha p. 4.</p>
<p>Both Manu !213 and the Viṣnudharmasūtra prescribe that homas in which the Sun is the deity worshipped and Sāntihomas should be perforined by i householder on the partans (i. e. on Paurpamāsi and Amīvāsyā). These were śāntis at fixed periods. Similarly, when a person, male or female, of any casto completed sixty years, there was the possibility that he may die soon, or that he may lose his mother or father or his wife or sons or that various diseases may affect him; for removing this danger a śānti is prescribed (and is often performed even now) in order that he may enjoy a long life, be free from all calamities and for his complete prosperity. This is called Şaṣtyabdapūrti (completion of sixty years) or Ugrarathaśānti.12174</p>

<p>History of Dharmaśāstra (Soc. III, Ch. XXI</p>
<p>One of the oldest available descriptions of tho Ugraratha śānti is found in the Baudhāyanagrhyasosa-sūtra (V. 8.). It is brief and the main items in it are set out here. It should be performed in the month of one&rsquo;s birth and on the naksatra of birth. A l&rsquo;elli as large as a bull&rsquo;s hide slould be made, &amp; jar full of water should be placed thereon and on the jar an image of Mityu (Death) manufactured with two niskis (i. e. gold probably weighing as much) should be placed in the south-east corner; worship should be offered to tho image and a jup of euch of the niantras &lsquo;apaitu mṛtyuḥ&rsquo; (&lsquo;may Death go away&rsquo;, Tai. Br. lII, 7. 14. 4), &lsquo;param Mrtyo&rsquo; (O Death! follow tho path beyond &amp;c.&rsquo;, Tai. Br. II, 7. 14. 5 and Rg. X. 18. 1), &lsquo;mi nas-toko&rsquo; (O Rudra! do not injure our progany&rsquo; &amp;c., Tai. S. VII. 1. 11. 2 and Rg. I, 114.8), and. Tryanıbakam&rsquo; (&lsquo;we offer sacrifice to Rudra&rsquo;, Tai. S. I. 8.6.2 and Rg. VII. 59. 12) be made 108 tirnes; he offers oblations of cooked food with the fillilllllllūlyū (invitatory prayer) &lsquo;mī no mahāntam&rsquo;( Rudra! du not destroy our grown up ones &amp;c.&rsquo;, Tai. S. IV.5. 10., and Rg. I. 114.7) and the lījyū (offering prayer) “Mā nas-toke&rsquo; (Tai. S. III, 4. 11.? and Rg. I 114, 8). Then he makes subsidiary offerings of ghee with each verse of the Gortasūkta. 1218 Then be sprinkles himself with water from the jar to the accompaniinent of mantras from the Mrtyusūkta, from the Āyusyasūkta and with Paurānika mantras, honours the officiating priest, gives dakśiṇā to the brāhmanas and &amp; dinner.</p>
<p>There is a Ms. (of only three folios in D. C. No. 609 of the year 1882–83, now in the Bhandarkar Oriental Institute at Poona) which deals with this sānti attributed to Saunaka and is called Ugrarathaśānti at the end. The sānti is to be performed on the day or naksatra of one&rsquo;s birth. On that day the person of 60 years should take an auspicious bath, perform his daily religious duties, should invite brāhmaṇas and choose one to officiate who is learned in the Vedas and Vedāngas and is well conducted. First Ganesa worship should be performed, then</p>

<li>1218 It is difficult to say what hymn is intended here by the word &lsquo;gbrtasūkteoa&rsquo;. It is probably Rg. VI. 70. 1-6 (ghstavati bhuvanisim &amp;c.). The Mștyusūkta is probably the same as Rg. X. 18. The Āyusya hyma is a Khila hymo after Rg. X, 128 and begina &lsquo;āyusyam varcasyam rāyasposam agdbbidam,&rsquo; The Karmapradipa of Gobbila (1, 17) prescribes that Āyusya hymos should be recited in sraddha for śānti, The Smṛticandrikā (sāddba p. 503 ) quotes Gobbila I. 17 and explains that they are bymas like the one beginning &lsquo;ā no bhadrah&rsquo; Rg.

Then he should make a hom in honour of Mrtyuñjaya (Siva) with oblations of dūrvā grass and sesame 10000, or 5000, or 3000 or one thousand in number and then he should sacrifice separately to the secondary objects of worship, viz. Asvatthaman, Bali, Vyāsa, Hanumat, Bibhiṣana, Krpa and Paraśurāma. Then he should perform a homa with fried grams according to his ability and should recite Srīsūkta, 1221 Rudra, the Āyusya mantras, the Purusasūkta and specially the complete recitation of the Veda; he should finish the homa and offer pūrṇāhuti; then water from the jar should be sprinkled over the yajamāna (i. e. person who has completed 60 years ), his wife and his near relatives; then there should be a japa of śānti hymn, the Puruṣasūkta, the mantra Rg. X. 18. 1, the Āyusya hymn, Pāvamāna hymn (hymn to Soma from Rg. IX. ), the six verses of Sivasankalpa ( Vāj. S. 32.1-6), and Mahāśānti. Then the jar should be donated and the garments rendered wet by the abhiṣeku and a decked cow with calf should be donated to the officiating priest; ten (dūnas 1.22 to brāhmaṇas and gold weighing one hundred mūnas; he should perforın ājyāvekṣana and offer bali&rsquo; (to all beings, crows &amp;c.); he should then receive the blessings of the brāhmavas and put on a new garment; then he should have nirūjuna performed and bow to deities and feed a thousand or a hundred brāhmanas and then himself partake of food along with his relatives.

<p>It is difficult to say why this śānti was called Ugraratha. Another śānti on the completion of 70 years or on the 7th night of the 7th month of the 77th year is called Bhaimarathi-santi, according to the Sabdakalpadruma, which quotes some verses from Punyaka without stating what work is moant.1223 Baud. grhyasosasūtra I. 24 prescribes a śānti for one who has lived up to 100 years or one who has seen 1000 amirāsyis.</p>
<p>The general rule about the time for santis is that no definite time can be fixed for them, since sānti rites are performed with the object of remoring the evil consequences of men&rsquo;s lapses suggested by such indications (or cmens) as dreams, the evil aspects of planets and the like i. e. they are to be performed as and when omens or portents occur or are observed and one should not wait for such times as the northward passage of the Sun, bright fortnight and that one may perform sāntis even in the southward passage of the Sun or even in an intercalary</p>

Vide also p. 290 above about Kotihona prescribed by the Atharva-parisista ( XXXI pp. 187-191). The Matsya prescribes that a Kotihoma should be begun in Caitra or Kārtika (239. 20-21); the invisi bility of Jupiter and Venus and similar matters need not be considered when a śānti has to be performed immediately on the occurrence of an omen (or portent) or when the śānti is meant for alleviating the disease from which a person may be suffering,</p>
<p>As against several udthurus and trūtas, texts prescribe a rite called Mahāśānti. The Sāṅkhāyana Gr.(V. 11 ) speaks of a Mahāśānti, when an ant-bill grows in one&rsquo;s house, which has been referred to abuve on p. 730 note 1162. The details of a Mahāśānti differ in different texts and on different occasions. The Ad bhuta-sāgara provides that where no specific details about santis against cortain utpūtas like a fall of meteors are prescribed one should have recourse to a sānti consisting in homa offerings to the accompaniment of one million repetitions of the sacred Gāyatri verse (&lsquo;tat-savitur&rsquo; &amp;c. Rg. III. 62. 10) or to the Mahāśānti called Abhayā according to the nature (grave or light) of the omen or portent.1226 In the Marāļhi commentary on the</p>

<p>Nirnayasindhu (p. 233 ) about the question of a rite on the first appearance of a woman&rsquo;s monthly illness a japa of Mahāśānti is prescribed after an elaborate hoina and worship and the Malā śānti is explained as consisting of the recitation of Rg. 1. 89. 1-10 (beginning with &lsquo;ā no bhadra&rsquo;), Rg. V. 51. 11-15 (beginning with &lsquo;spasti no mimitām &amp;c.') and Rg. VII. 33. 1-15 ( begin ning with &lsquo;san-na Indrāgni&rsquo;). The Bhaviscottara (113. 2-46) describes a Mahāśānti to be performed at a king&rsquo;s coronation, on his marching out on an invasion, when one has bad dreams or inauspicious omens (rimillas ), when the planots are un favourable or when there is lightning and the fall of moteors, when a Ketu appears, in it liurricane, carthquake, birth on a Mūla naksatra or Gardinta, on birth of twins, when parasols and banners fall on the grulind, when a crow, owl or pigeon enters a house, when malefic planets are retrograde (cspecially in the naksatra or rūsi uf birth), when Jupiter, Saturn, Mars and the Sun aro in the 1st, 1th, 8th or 13th houses (in a person&rsquo;s horoscope), when there is 01.11! yulelor; when garments, weapons, horses and cows, or jewels and hair are lost, or when rainbow is seen at night in front, when the beam on a house pillar is smashed, whon a sho-mule conceives, on eclipses of the Sun and the Moon-on these a Malāśānti is commended. The procedure is briefly as follows: Five learned and well-conducted brahmanas should officiato in &amp; iniumpre ton or twelve cubits on each side, in the midst of which there should be a raised platform four cubits on each side and in the south-east corner of that platform there should be a kunılı (receptacle for fire). Five jars should be placed, four in the four intermediate quarters (south-east &amp;c.) and the fifth in the middle of the platform and numerous things such as twigs and leaves of some plants, jetrels, sandalwood, mustard grains, suni and dūrưā, kuśrs and grains of rico sl:ould be collectod thorcon; Vedic mantras such as &lsquo;āśuḥ śiśāno&rsquo; (Rg. X. 103.1) on north west, ' iśā vāsya&rsquo;( Vāj. S. 40,1) on north-east, were to be recited over the jars, worship is to be offered with qanılhi, flowers, lamps, fruits like cocoanut to the jars and fire should be placed in the kundu with &lsquo;agnim dūtam&rsquo; (Rg. I. 12. 1), seat (ūsuina) should be offerred with the mantra &lsquo;kiranya-garbhaḥ&rsquo; (Rg. X. 121.1), then pūyusa should be cooked to the accompaniment of Puruṣa sūkta ( Rg.

<p>The huge work Adbhutasāgara is mostly concerned with rare natural phenomena such as halo, rainbows, hurricanes, glowing horizon (laguūru), meteors, comets, earthquakes, rain without clouds, red rain, shower of fish, Fata Morgama &amp;c.</p>
<p>A few words must be said about some striking ones out of these. First comes earthquake. The Bṛ. S. (32.1-2) puts forth four theories of his predecessors about the cause of an earthquake viz. it was caused by huge animals dwelling inside the seas (view of Kāśyapa) or according to others (Garga ) it was caused by the heavy breaths emitted by the elephants of the quarters when tired by carrying the reight of the earth; others (like Vasistha) said that earthquake noise is caused by the winds striking against each other (in the sky) and falling on the earth; other acāryas (like Vṛddhagarga) held that an earthquake was caused by adsta (i. e, by the sins of the people on the earth 1977). In verses 3-7 of Br. S. (chap. 3:2) Varāba narrates the myth that mountains had in the dim past wings and the earth being much shaken by their movements approached Pitāmaha (Brabmā) and Brahmā seeing her sad plight asked Indra to discharge bis thunderbolt for clipping the wings of mountains and for removing the anger (or sorrow) of the earth; Indra did so, but he told the earth that Vāyu, Agni, Indra (himself) and</p>

<p>Varuṇa would (each) at different parts of the day and night make the earth shake in ordor to indicate (to mortals) the fruits of their good and bad deeds. In Bș. S. 32, 8-: Varāha describes the spheres and premonitory signs of Vāyu, Agni, Indra and Varuna with the nakṣatras and the countries they affect. The Adbhuta sāgara (pp. 383-409) quotes most of the rerses of Varāba and prese cribes sāntis for each of the four deities that are deemed to be con nected with earthquakes. Thc Adbhutusigara refers to earthquakes that happened when angry Arjuna got no sleop after he made a vow that he would kill Jayadratha before the next day&rsquo;s sunset (Dropaparva 77. +) and when Duryodhana challenged Bhima for a mace fight (Salyaparya 56.10 and 58.19).</p>
<p>It should not be a matter for surprise that ancient and medieral Indians regarded earthquakos as punishments sent by God for the sins of men. The English poet Cowper gives vent to this belief in his poem &lsquo;Timepeace&rsquo;, 1228 The most distinguished Indian of modern times viz. Mahatmi Gāndhi, regarded the earthquake in Bihar that ocurred on January 15, 1934, and affected an area of about 30000 square iniles and a population of about 15 millions and that killed thousands and made millions homeless, as God&rsquo;s punishment for the prevalence of the evil system of untouchability in Hindu 1.24 society. To the natural and usual query why God should punish a small country or a small community with frightful earthquakes and overwhelm. ing waves when other countries and millions of other people are guilty of the same misdeeds, Cowper endeavours to give a reply</p>

<p>The rules to be observed about eclipses have already been stated above (pp. 243-250). Though the real causes of lunar and solar eclipses were known long before the time of Varaha inihira as shown above (p. 242, n 622) this knowledge was not accopted by the masses for centuries and even now many people in India still entertain the old beliefs about eclipses.1230 Varāha criticises ancient writers like Vṛddha Garga and Parāśara who prophesied an eclipse when five planets including Mercury came together or there were such niinillas as halo of the Sun, dim rays 1231 ( Br. S. V. 16-17). Here the Santi for it will be briefly described. One view was that an eclipse was auspicious 1232 to a person, if the eclipse occurs when the Sun or the Moon is in the 3rd, 6th, 10th or 11th rāśi (zodiacal sign) from the rāśi of the birth of a person, it is noither auspicious nor inauspicious when any one of the two is in 2nd, 5th, 7th or 9th rāśi from that of birth and it is inauspicious when the eclipsed sun or moon is in the 1st, 4th, 8th and 12th rāśi from the rāśi of birth. The view of Garga was that if an eclipse occurs when the sun or moon is in the rāśi of the birth of a person or if any of them is in the 1st, 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th or 12th rāśi from that of birth or if any of them occupies the nakṣatra of the birth of a person or the 9th nakṣatra from that of birth, it leads to calamities for that person. If an eclipse occurred when the Sun or Moon occupied the bakṣatra of the day of the coronation of the king, that portends the ruin of the kingdom, the loss of friends and</p>

<p>the death of the king. 1233 Atri said that when the eclipse of the Sun or Moon occurs in the nakṣatra of a person&rsquo;s birth, disease, journeys and death are portended, and great danger for the king (whose nakṣatra is so affected). The averting of evil would follow if the man makes gifts and is engaged (that day) in worship of gods and japa.1231 Several modes of śānti are pre scribed, particularly for him whose rāśi or nakṣatra of birth or one of three nakṣatras (viz. that of birth, the one preceding and the one following the paksatra of birth) is occupied by the eclipsed Sun or Moon. One way is to make the figure of a serpent (that represents the demon Rāhu) with gold or flour and to donate it to a brāhmaṇa. Another was to make a serpent out of gold weighing a palu ( i. e. 320 gunjas) or one half, one fourth or one eighth pala and to fix a jewel on its hood and place the sorpont figure in a vessel of copper, bronze or cast iron full of ghee and donate it with a daksiṇā and also donate a silver diso of the moon and a golden serpent when it is a lunar eclipse and a golden disc of the Sun and a golden serpent when it is a solar eclipse. Further gifts of a horse, chariot, cows, land, sesame, ghee and gold also are recommended. The mantra accompanying the gifts addressed to Rābu is quoted below.1235 The Nirnayasindhu also sets out a far more elaborate santi from the Matsyapurāna, which is passed over for reasons of space.</p>
<p>• The fall of meteors (ulka) required a śānti. There were several beliefs about them. Garga held that they were missiles discharged by the Lokapālas 1236 who send down flaming meteore as missiles for indicating (coming) auspicious or calamitous events. Another view was that they were really souls that fell</p>

<p>down to the earth (for fresh births) atter enjoying in heaven the favourable results of their actions. 1337 Moteots are often referred to in the epios as falling on serious occasions 8. g. the Salya-parya mentions 1238 the fall of a flaming meteor accomp anied by a great noise and whirlwind whon Duryodhana fell in the macefight with Bhima In Dronaparva a flaming meteor is referred to as indicative of the coming death of the great ācārya and warrior Drona. The Adbhutasāgara (pp. 342-344) quotes &amp; long passage (of 231 verses) from Atharvaṇādbhuta about the fall of meteors 1239 by day. It is said therein that such a fall of meteors by day portends the destruction of the country and its king and therefore a Mahāśānti called Amrtā should be por formed. There is an Atharvaṇa-parisista LVIII b on ulkā, but the Adbhutasāgara versos do not appear to have been extracted from that.</p>
<p>Certain natural phenomena, though they may be oalled utpātas if they occur at certain times, are not to be regarded 28 such at certain other times. In Bṛ. 8. 45. 82 Varāha says that certain occurrencos natural to certain seasons do not lead to any unfavourable consequences; one should know them from the verses composed by Rṣiputra that are concise. Then he pro ceeds: in Madhu and Mādhaya (Caitra and Vaisakha) the following occurrences lead to good viz. lightning, meteors, earth quake, glowing twilight, noisy whirl-winds, halo (of Sun and Moon), dust in the sky, vapour (in forest), red sunrise and sunset; possibility of getting from trees food, rasas ( sweet &amp;c.), oily substances, numerous flowers and fruits; and amorous activities among cows and birds. The following are beneficial ( auspicious ) in summer (Jyestha and Aṣadha) viz. sky rendered dusky by the fall of stars and meteors, or in which the appear ance of the Sun and the Moon is dark-brown, which is full of fiery glow without a flaring fire, loud noises, vapour, dust and</p>

In the rains (Srāvana and Bhadrapada) the following portend no dangor vis. rainbow, halo (of Sun and Moon), lightning, dried trees giving out fresh sprouts, the earth quaking or rolling or showing other than its usual appearance, noises in the earth or gaps therein, or when lakes increase in expanse of water or rivers rise up (in floods), or when wells are full or when houses on bills roll down. In Sarad (Āśvina and Kārtika) the following are not of evil import viz. the sight of divine damsels, ghosts, gandharvas, air conveyances and other adbhutas; the planets, nakṣatras and other stars becoming visible by day in the sky; noises of song and music in forests and on mountain peaks; abundance of crops and reduction of waters. In Hemanta (Mārgasirsa and Pauṣa ) the following are auspicious viz. the progence of cool winds and frost, loud cries of birds and beasts, the sight of raksas (evil spirits), Yaksas and other (usually invisible) beings, non-buman voices, directions darkened by vapour together with the sky, forests and mountains, the appearance of the rise and setting of the Sun at a higher point than usual, The following appearances are auspicious in Siśira (Magha and Phālguna) viz. the fall of snow, portentous winds, sight of terrible beings and adbhutas, sky resembling dark collyrium and rendered reddish-yellow by the fall of meteors and stars, the birth of various strange issue from women, Cows, sheep, mares, beasts, and birds, strange appearances of leaves, sprouts and croopers.

In my opinion it is probable that the Viṣnud harmottara borrows the verses from the Brbat-gambitā. If that he accepted, tbe Vigoudbarmottara (at least the 2nd section of it ) must be later than 600 A, D. It is possible to argue that the Purāṇa might have taken them from Rsipatra. But the Purāṇa does not say so and in keeping with the assumed character of the Purāgas as composed by the semi-divine Vyāsa at the beginning of Kali yoga, the Purānas generally take care pot to admit aby borrowing from a merely human author.

<p>Viṣṇu the Matsyapurāṇa 1244 states the images of all gods shut and open their eyes, laugh, weep, scream, emit smoke, blaze, and these signs indicate that great danger impends. In the Atharvana-parisiṣta 1245 LXXII this matter is treated (in prose). It says there are portents called dryja which occur in temples ; they (images) laugh, sing, weep, shriek, perspire, Cause smoke to issue out of them, they blaze, they tremble, open their eyes and shut them, blood oozes from them, they move to and fro&rsquo; These strange phenomena are said to forebode drought, danger from weapons, famine, epidemic in the country and destruction of the king and his ministers (or relatives). The śānti pre scribed in the same Atharvaṇa-parisista (4.7) is as follows: one should boil pāyasa in the milk of 108 kapilā cows; if such cows are not available one should cook payasa with the milk of one hundred milch cows; he should put on the fire fuel sticks with ends towards the east, should spread round the fire darbha grass and should offer oblations (of rice) in fire to the accompaniment of the mantras addressed to Rudra 1245 and called Raudra-gana and also offer clarified butter (in fire). He should present white flowers, he should treat brāhmaṇas with boiled rice and should donate the same cows (the milk of which was used for cooking payaga ) or donate the kingdom for a limited period for the satisfaction of a brāhmaṇa; he should give to the officiating priest a thousand cows and donate a good village. * Now śāntis on the birth of human beings should be referred to. There are several śāntis concerning the birth of a human being, such as a child&rsquo;s birth on Mūla, Aśleṣā, Jyesthā nakṣatras, on gan lanta, on the 14th tithi of the dark fortnight or on</p>

<p>Santi for birth on Āfleṣa</p>
<p>771</p>
<p>amāvāsyā, on Vyatipata-yoga or on Vaidhfti or in an eclipse, or on the birth of twins, or when a girl is born to a person after three successive births of sons or a son is born after three sucoes give births of girls. Some of those sāntis are performed even now. Therefore two of them which are still in vogue, though gradually becoming infraquent, are briefly described here. The consequences of birth on Mūla, Jyesthā and Asleṣā are more or legs similar. Here the śānti for birth on Āśleṣā is briefly set out.</p>
<p>The Asleṣā naksatra has a mean measure of 60 ghatia. It is to be divided into ten parts in order 13466 viz. 5, 7, 2, 3, 4, 8, 11, 6, 9 and 5; birth of a son in these parts indicates in order the loss of kingdom, death of father, death of mother, addiction to lovemaking, he has devotion to father, has strength, loses pro perty, has proneness to charity, pleasures,&lsquo;wealth. If the nakṣatra be divided into four parts, birth in the first part is auspicious but in the other three parts indicates loss of wealth, death of father, death of mother. If the child is a girl born on the last three quarters of Āśleṣā indicates the death of the future mother-in-law of the girl; if the child be a boy and is born in the last three quarters of Āśleṣā, that indicates death of his future mother-in-law. One should perform a sānti for birth on any quarter of Aśleṣā, either on the 12th day from birth, or if that be not possible, on the next Aśleṣā or on any auspicious day. On that day he (the father or other performer) should make a sankalpa 1247 as noted below</p>

A śānti for the birth of a child on the 14th tithi of the dark half is still in vogue and the author knows abuut it personally; it is described at length in the Madanaratna (fulio 24 from Gārgya) and in Sānti-kamalakara. The santi on the birth of a child on Mūla naksatra is described in Madanaratna from Garga (folio 27b to 286,)one peculiarity of which is that the father had to collect one hundred roots of trees and plants (mūla means &lsquo;root&rsquo;).

<p>The birth of a girl after three successive births of boys or of a buy after three successive births of girls was supposed to indicate unfavourable consequences to the parents and the family and death of the eldest, loss of wealth and great sorrow. There fore a śānti was recommended on the 1lth or 12th day from the birth of a girl or buy (as the case inay be) or on an auspicious day, He (the father) should choose ācārys (chief officiating priest) and otlier priests, then perform a sacrifice to planets and offer worship to the golden image. vf Lralnā, Vionu, Siva and Indra on a jar placed on a heap of grains. On a fifth jar he should worship Rudra and und lrūhrera should recite four hymns to Rudra oleven times and all -intisuktas when homa is being performed.

<p>destruction of the country or family&rsquo;. The Matsyapurāṇa 235. 1-3 and Viṣnudharmottara II, 140. 1-3 have identical verses similar to the above. The Bhlsmaparva 1250 (chap. 3.2-7) refers to portentous births such as the following ; &lsquo;pregnant women and women who had never before given birth to sons produce mon strosities; so also even wives of men who are Vedic scholary are giving birth to eagles and peacocks, mares give birth to calves, dogs to jackals; some women have given birth to four or five girls (at the same time) &amp;c.: The Bṛ. S. proceeds 1251 &lsquo;If mares, camels, she-buffaloes and cow-elephants give birth to twins, that portends death to them. The effect of such births will come to pass about six months later; Garga has declared twu ślukas as to the śānti in such cases. The women that give birth (to twins or monstrosities ) should be removed to another place (ur country) by one that desires his own happiness, he should gratify brābmaṇas by gifts of things desired by them and should cause &amp; śānti (propitiatory rite) to be performed; as to quadrupeds, they should be removed from their flocks or herds and be aband oned in other countries; otherwise there would be ruin of the town, the owner and the flock or herd.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Various modes were employed to divine the future, viz. (1) the position of planets and stars, (3) indiridual horoscopes, (3) flight and cries of birds like khasjana and crow, (+) natural phenomena (eclipses, meteors &amp;c.), (5) dreams, (6) voices suddenly heard, (7) the physical and mental conditions of mon, animals &amp;c. The first four hare already been briefly dealt with. Now dreams will be taken up for discussion.</p>
<p>It has already been geen (p. 728, notes 1157 and 1158) how in the Vedic literature dreams had been associated with good luck or ill-luck. The two epics, the Svapnādhyāya (of Atharvana-pari. śista LXVIII pp. 438-449), the Brhad-yoga-yātrā of Vāraha (chap. 16.1-31 ), Purāṇas such as Vāyu (chap. 19.13–18), Matsya (chap.242), Vispudharmottara (II. 176), Bhavisya I. 194, Brahma vaivarta-purāṇa (Ganesa-khanda 34. 10-40 ), describe good or bad dreams; Agni (229, many verses of which are the same</p>

<p>Works on sāntis about dreams</p>
<p>775</p>
<p>as those of Matsya chap. 242), Bhujabala of Bhoja (pp. 298-304 verses 1347-1378 ), the Adbhutasāgara pp. 493-515 deal at length with the matters relating to dreams and śāntis therefor. Saṅkarā cārya in his commentary on Vodāntasūtra 1952 remarks that those who have studied the Svapnādhyaya declare that to see oneself riding on an elephant or the like is auspicious and to see oneself sitting in a conveyance drawn by asses is inauspicious (or unlucky). It appears that rarely an ancient writer like Angiras 1253 said &lsquo;the movements of planets, dreams, nimittas (like throbbing), utpātas ( portents) produce some consequences by chance; wise men are not afraid of them&rsquo;. Numerous dreams are mentioned in the Rimāyapa on several occasions. Some examples may be given. In the Sundarakānda (chap. 27,3 ff) Trijatā (a rūkṣasi ) details several dreams that she saw and that indicated the destruction of rāksasas and that were favourable to Rāma. Among the evil omens that she saw in her dream about Rāvana were; he had his head shaved, he drank oil with which he was drenched, he was dressed in red garments, was intoxicated, wore wreaths of Karavira flowers, he fell on the earth from his puspaka balloon, he was carried in a chariot drawn by asses, he was wearing red</p>
<p>flowers and was anointed with red unguents &amp;c. (verses 19-27). Similar dreams occur as seen by Trijatā in the story of Rāma contained in the Vanaparra chap. 280. verses 64-66. In the Ayodhyākā»da (chap. 69. 8. ff) Bharata who was with his maternal uncle saw in a dream his father (Dasaratha) dirty and with disherelled hair, falling from a mountain peak in a turbid lake full of cowdung, drinking that dirty water and oil; he also saw the ocean dried up and the moon fallen on the earth, he saw his father seated on a dark seat of iron and wearing black gar ments and beaten by women dark and tawny in colour, he saw him going to the south in a chariot drawn by asses &amp;c. Bharata says that these dreams indicated the death of the king (Daśaratha) or of Rāma or Lakṣmana. In the Mausalaparya of the Mahā bhārata (chap. 3. 1-4) the Yādavas saw in dreams a black woman with whitish teeth running to Dvārakā with a laugh and kidnapping their women and terrible vultures were seen to be devouring the Vrsnis and Andhakas in their own houses in which sacred fires had been establisbed &amp;c.</p>

<p>One passage froni</p>
<p>5031 is cited here</p>
<p>It is impossible to point out the unlucky and lucky dreams as their number mentioned in Adbhutasagara (pp. 502-513), quoting the Puriṇas, Parāśara, the works of Varāba and others is extremely large. One passage from the Matsyapurana ( 242 verses 2-14, quoted in Adbhutasāgara pp. 502-503) is cited here by way of illustration; &lsquo;the springing of grass and plants from one&rsquo;s body (except from the navel); bronze vessels dashed against one&rsquo;s head and pulverized; sharing of the head; nakedness; wearing dirty garments; bath with oil; being smeared with mud; fall from a bigh spot (hill &amp;c.); sitting in a swing, collecting mud and iron; killing horses; ascond ing trees that have flowers and over circles and riding boars, bears, asses and camels; eating of (the flesh of) birds and fishes and oil and rice mixed with midga or maṣa; dancing, laughing, marriage and singing; playing on musical instru monts other than stringed ones; going for a dip in a river; bath with water mixed with cowdung or mud or with water fallen on bare earth; entering the womb of one&rsquo;s mother; ascending a funeral pyre; the fall of Indra&rsquo;s banner; the fall of the Sun and the Moon; seeing portents of the three kinds (heavenly, those in atmospheric regions and earthly); anger of gods, brāhmaṇas, kings and one&rsquo;s lux; embracing maidons; sodomy; loss of one&rsquo;s limbs; vomiting and purging; going to the southern direction; being overwhelmed by a disease; fall of fruits and of flowers; fall of houses; sweeping of houses with a broom; playing with goblias, birds or animals that subsist on putrid flesh, monkeys, bears and men; humilia tion by strangers (or enemies); arising of calamity brought on by another person (or enemy); wearing ochre-coloured garments; playing with women; plunging into oil or drinks; wearing red flowers and applying red unguents; these and others are inaus picious dreams.</p>

<p>The manner of examining king&rsquo;s dream</p>
<p>777</p>
<p>astrologers and purohita should enter the temple of his favourite deity, should place the images of the dikpālas therein, worship them with mantras, place four jars full of water in the four directions, should thrice repeat the mantras beginning with *Yajjāgrato dūram&rsquo; (Vaj. S. 34. 1), should eat only once that day, sleep on his right side and pray to Rudra (as noted in n 1254) and examine the dream, auspicious or inauspicious, seen towards the close of night.</p>
<p>The Matsya (242.21-35) sets out1255 lucky dreams as follows: ascending (or riding on) mountains, palaces, elephants, horses and bulls; going among troos having white flowers; the shooting of trees and grass from the navel and seeing (the sleeper) endowed with many hands or heads; wearing garlands of very white flowers and very white garments; eclipse of the Sun, Moon and naksatras; sprinkling water (on one&rsquo;s body) all over; embracing or raising the banner of Indra; seizure of the earth and seas; slaughter of enemies; victory in disputes, in gambling and in battle; eating of wet (fresh) meat, of fish and of pāyasa (rice boiled in milk and sugar); seeing blood or being bathed with it; drinking liquor, blood, intoxicants and milk; being surrounded on the earth with intestines; sight of bright sky; sucking the udders (the milk) of cows and she-buffaloes and of lionesses, cow-elephants and maros; receiving favours from (images of) gods, gurus and brāhmaṇas; bath with water flowing from the horns of cows or falling from the Moon (this prognos ticates the acquisition of a kingdom); being crowned as a king: the cutting of one&rsquo;s head; one&rsquo;s death; being burnt by fire; one&rsquo;s house and the like being burnt down by fire; securing the insignia of royalty; playing on the lute; swimming beyond waters; crossing difficult places; the delivery in one&rsquo;s own house of cows, mares and cow-elephants; being mounted on horses; weeping; obtain ing of handsome women or embracing them; being bound with fetters; being smeared with excreta; seeing living kings and friends; seeing images of gods and pure (or pellucid) waters. On seeing such auspicious dreams a man easily secures per manent wealth and he who is suffering from a disease becomes</p>
<p>free from it.</p>
<p>In the Jain Kalpasūtra of Bhadrabāhu (8. B. E. vol. XXII, p. 129) fourteen very auspicious dreams seen by the brahmani Dovanandā are enumerated, viz: an elephant, a bull, a lion,</p>

<p>Matsya (chap. 243. 2-12) sets out the sights that are unlucky when they come before a king who is going on an invasion (such as improper drugs, corn with dark exterior, cotton, grass, dry cow dung and many others) and prescribes that on seeing these for the first time he should worship Kośava with a laud and that if he sees it a second time he should enter his palace. Yogayātrā (chap. 13. 4 ff) provides what the king starting on an expedition should hear viz. such recitations as that of the Veda, Vedangas, Dharmaśāstras, Arthaśāstra, Mahābhārata, Rāmāyana, Purāpa passages. Matsya (chap. 243.15-25) proscribes the sights that are auspicious (such as white flowers, jars full of water, aquatic birds, meat and fish, flaming fire, courtezans, Durva grass, fresh cowdung, gold, silver, copper and all jewels besides Beveral others and winds up with a fine sentiment, 1256 viz. the ease (or satisfaction ) of one&rsquo;s mind is the highest sign of success; on one side are all prognostications and on the other is the mind&rsquo;s ease. The Bșhad-yogayātra of Varaha has a similar verso. Vide H. of Dh. vol, II pp. 511, 876 and notes 1192 and 2048 therein for two sets of auspicious sights. The Jyotistattva (pp. 729 730) quotes several verses on the objects that are auspicious or inauspicious when seen by a person starting on a journey or expedition and remarks that the same objects when seen in a dream are of the same ( auspicious or inauspicious ) quality. The Vasantarāja-śākuna (V. 2-6) sets out fifty objects that are auspicious when starting on a journey or entering &amp; homo such as curds, sandal wood, ghee, dūrvā, a jar full of water &amp;c. and (V. 10-11) specifies the thirty objects that are inauspicious.</p>

If on the same night one goes both auspicious and inauspicious dreams, one (the astrologer ) should declare that the last dream (alone) will yield consequences. Therefore, when a person sees an auspicious dream ho should not go to sleep thereafter. Declaring a bad dream to another is commended as also sleeping after seeing it; bath with water mixed with the viscous sediment of oily substances, homa of sesame, honouring brahmanas, hymn of praise to Vāsudova and worship of him and listening to the story of the liberation of Gajendra- those remove the evil effects of bad dreams.&rdquo; In connection with the vrata called &ldquo;Siddhar thakadi-saptami&rsquo; performed for gaining the favour of the Sun the Bhavisya (Brahma-parva, 194. 1-25) sets out the dreams which are auspicious or favourable to the person performing the vrata Those verses are similar to those in the Matsya and are quoted by Krtyakalpataru (on vrata pp. 176-179). One verse says &lsquo;on seeing a favourable dream one should not sleep again, but declare in the morning the dream as seen to Bhojakas and brāhmaṇas (or to Bhojaka brāhmaṇas).&rsquo; The Bșhadyoga yātrā contains similar verses as quoted by Adbhutasagara p. 501.</p>

<p>inauspicious.</p>
<p>The Atharvana-parisista1260 LXVIII (pp. 438-449) states that persons have different dreams according as their constitu tions (prakrti) are choleric or windy or phlegmatic (pitta, rata and kapha) and long lists of dreams and their interpretations are given and it prescribes the same remedies against bad dreams as Varabia does.</p>

<p>All ancient countries and peoples believed in dreams and satisfied their curiosity to know the future by interpreting them. The Chaldean astrologers and dream-interpreters were in high favour at Babylonian and Assyrian courts. The Book of Daniel (chap. 2) tells us how Nebuchadnezzar, a great king of Babylon, asked the Chaldeans not only to interpret dreams but commanded them on threat of death to make known to him the dream which he had forgotten and then to interpret it. Plato, the greatest of the Greek philosophers, regards dreams as important physical and paychio symptoms while certain dreams are con coded as of supernatural origin and explains in his Timaeus (chap. 46 and 47) that dreams are prophetic visions received by the lower appetitive soul (through the liver). In JRAS (old series) vol, 16 pp. 118-171 N. Bland contributos a long and inter esting article on the Mahomedan science of. Tābir or inter pretation of dreams.&rsquo; There are striking parallels between the rules to be observed by the dreamer and by the interpreter and the principles of interpretation (of dreams) by contrarios and by dependence upon the religion, country and bodily conditions (such as total fast or full stomach) of the dreamer. On p. 141 of JRAS there is an interesting account of a dream of Nushirwan, a Sassanian :king. (531-579 A. D.), who saw &amp; dream that he drank from a golden goblet and that a black hog put its head in the goblet and drank from it. Then we are told &lsquo;Buzurmihr, his minister, whom he consulted, told him it signi fied that his favourite princess had a black slave who was her loyer and suggested that the women of his harem should be ordered to dance undressed in the presence of the king. One of them showing some hesitation in complying and being protected by the others was discovered to be a Hindu male slave and the</p>

<p>Vazir&rsquo;s interpretation was verified.&rsquo; The name of the Vazir romarkably agrees in sound with the name Varahamihira and it is not very fantastic to suppose that Varāhamihira, probably the most famous astrologer and astronomer of early times in India, had been patronized by Nushiryan and held a high position in his court. Chronology is quite in favour of this identification since Varāhamibira takos śaka 427 (505 A. D.) as the starting point for finding out the ahargana.</p>
<p>In modern 1261 times many educated people think dreams as of no consequence whatever, while there are others who regard dreams as almost infallible indicators of coming events; there is also a third class of people who are willing to listen to the argu ments advanced on behalf of the interpretors of dreams and also of those who regard thoughts on the use and value of dreams as frivolous. To those who want to hear arguments on both sides and to form a judgment of their own about dreams, I would recommend the &lsquo;Fabric of Dreams&rsquo; by Catherine Taylor Craig ( Kegan Paul, Trench, Trubner, London, 1918); Freud&rsquo;s &lsquo;Interpretation of dreams&rsquo; is the most important of his works, in which he develops his psycho-analytic technique. Then there is the work Second sight in daily life&rsquo; by W. H. W. Sabine who has a theory of his own. His work deals with precognition (or foreknowledge ) which according to him is a sub division of Extra-sensory perception. He propounds the theory that the mind comprises of not only normal memory appearing to derive from physical perception but also &lsquo;anticipatory memory&rsquo; deriving from the Basic Experience which from time to time passes to some degree into conscious awareness. Time is one and does not exist except as a verbal convonience and that what we call &lsquo;future&rsquo; has already happened but it is not indicated in what form it has happened. Considerations of space and rele vance preclude further discussion of this subject here.</p>

He should perform the rites beginning with the worship of Ganeśa and ending with Mātspūjā, then establish a jar full of water and worship (the image of) Varuṇa therein, perform the rite of nirājana 1264 to the accompaniment of the sound of drums, sit on a seat of udumbara tree covered with a blanket and should request brāhmaṇas to sprinklo saored water on his person. The brāhmaṇas should sprinkle water on him to the accompaniment of a hymn to Varuna and a hymn to the Ganges. At the end of the abhiṣeka the performer should give up old garments and wear now ones and should worship the Ganges. Melted ghee should be put in a vessel of bronze and the performer should see the reflection of his face therein and then should see the face of his great-grandson in the light of a lamp placed in &amp; golden vessel. Then he should sprinkle drops of water on the great-grandson with one hundred flowers of gold. Then he should sprinkle the great-grandson with water from the jar Used for abhiseka. For completing the ceremony of seeing the face of the grandson, he should donate a cow and feed brahmanas according to his means. Then he should worship an image of Viṣṇu, offer pāyasa to it and address the following prayer 1265 &lsquo;O Visṇu ! by your favour I have seen the face of my great-grand son. Therefore, O Lord I in all ways and always do what I desire&rsquo;. Then the image should be donated with the mantra &lsquo;by the dona tion of the image (of Vispu) may all evil influences of planets be always conjured away in the case of the child, o enemy of Kamsa and the Lord of the worlds,&rsquo; and he should donate to the brāhmaṇas the ghee in which he saw his face.</p>

<p>such as good health, the removal of the diseases due to the three constituent elements of the human body, viz, hile, phlegm and rata (wind), that may have already arisen or are likely to arise, or for mitigating all the trouble that is causod by planets occupying unfavourable positions from the lima in a person&rsquo;s horoscope or from the rūśi of his birth, for removing the impurity on birth or death in one&rsquo;s bouse or family, for securing a happy life. Therefore, the sankalpa may assume various forms that are noted below. 1266 In modern times this is a very elaborats rite in which a very large number of Vedic verses are repeated and which takes up about three hours for its performance, Therefore, even a brief resume of the modern procedure is not attempted here. But one of the oldest available descriptions of this rite contained in the Baudhāyana-gļhya-seṣasūtra (I. 14) is set out here in order to convey an idea of this sānti. As the Baudhāyana-sūtras are closely connected with the Taittiriya samhitā and Brāhmaṇa the references to mantras and texts are cited as far as possible from that Samhitā and Brābmana. Many of the mantras occur also in the Rgreda and other samhitās. Here are the texts; waters indeed are faith; (when a priest takes water) he begins (the rite with) faith itself; waters are indeed the sacrifice, he begins sacrifice itself; water is indeed thunder bolt, he strikes the thunderbolt against enemies; waters are destroyers of malignant spirits (and it is taken) for destroying evil spirits; waters are the favourite abode (or seat) of the gods; waters are indeed nectar; therefore people sprinkle with water him who faints; waters are indeed all gods; he begins with gods. Waters indeed are well disposed; he (priest) removes with the kindly (waters) the pain of this person (the sacrificer); this is (what) the Brāhmaṇa (text) eays. .</p>
<p>Therefore (the priest.) prepares propitiatory 1267 water with two kuśas dipped therein. One should commence a śānti on the naksatra of (a person&rsquo;s birth) or on an auspicious naksatra or when auspicious rites are to be performed, viz. marriage, a (child&rsquo;s) tonsure, upanayana, Vedic student&rsquo;s return home, hairparting (of a pregnant woman), establishment of the Vedic fires and other</p>

S. IV. 2. 8. 2). Then he pours water across the two blades of darbha grass and mutters tat-savitur-varenyam&rsquo; (Rg.

<p>If a person suffers from fever the Madanaratna (folio 11) provides for sāntis for the tithis (from the first onwards) on which the fever started, derived from Baudhāyana in which the presiding deity of each tithi is to be offered worship (pūjā) and homa, for each of which the mantra (of which japa is to be made ) is different, and the incense, flowers, naivedya also are different. There are also śāntis, when a person suffers from fover, about the weekday on which the fever started and images of the presiding deity of the weekday made of different metals according to the name of the day are to be worshipped with different mantras (Madanaratna, folio 12a). For example, if føver started on a Sunday or on a Monday, then the images of Rudra (for Sunday) and Pārvati (for Monday ) were to be made of gold or silver and the mantras to be recited were respectively &lsquo;yā te Rudra&rsquo; (Tai. S. IV. 5. 1. 1), &lsquo;gaurir-mimāya&rsquo; (Rg. I. 164. 41). The gandha, flowers, incense, lamp and nairedya were different in each case. If the fever starts on any one of the 27 naksatras, the Madanaratna (folios 126-15b) prescribos śāntis for all the 27 nakṣatras, specifying the deity of each pakṣatra, the figure of the deity, its colour, mantra, the five upacāras from gandha, the kinds of fuel-sticks to be employed, the āhutis, the gifts &amp;c.

<p>Gayatri mantra (Rg. II. 6%. 10) was to be employed and the ābutis were to be 1008 or 108 according to the nature of the disease. The Madanratna (folios 15b-20b) quotes from Atreya further details about the 27 nakṣatras, via the number of stars in each nakṣatra, whether a naksatra is masculino, feminine or neuter, its figure, colour, deity, tree, its garza 177 (whether devagana or rāksasagana or manusyagana), what actions should be done on each, the Viṣanāds of each.</p>
<p>The Dharmasindhu provides a sānti for the extremely rare occurrence of a person coming to life after people thinking him to be dead take his body for cremation to a cometery. The person in whose house such a person enters meets death There fore, &amp; homa should be performed wherein eight thousand udumbara fuel-sticks anointed with milk and ghee are to be offered to the accompaniment of the Gāyatri mantra (Rg. II. 62. 10). At the end of the homa a kapila cow and a bronze vessel full of sesame should be donated to a brahmana; the bronze vessel should weigh 81 palas or 40% or 20+ or 9, 6 or at least three palas according 1277 to one&rsquo;s means.</p>
<p>Some works prescribe &amp; śānti on the delivery of a cow in the month of Bhadrapada, of a she-buffalo in Pausa and of a mare by day. The sānti is to be performed with 108 āhutis of ghee and sesame, the Asyavāmiya hymn (Rg. I 164) and the mantra &lsquo;tad-Viṣpoh&rsquo; (Rg. I 22.20 ) are to be recited.

<p>Sun is in the Lion sign, that portonds death of the 1778 owner in six months. It may be stated that in the author&rsquo;s boyhood such sāntis, particularly in the case of she-buffaloes, were performed. The Adbhutasāgara provides that the śānti should be performed on the 4th, 9th, 12th or 14th tithi, as these are declared to be auspicious tithis for adbhuta-śānti.1279</p>
<p>In modern times the entrance into a newly built house is preceded on the same day or on a previous day by a śānti called Vastusanti 1280 or Vastu-samana (in Matsya 268. 3). It has been described at some length in H. of Dh. vol. II. pp. 834-836. The description 1280a there is based on Matsya, chapters 256 and 268. Vāstusamana is also described in the Āśvalāyana gshya II.9.6-9, Par. gr. III. 4. 5-18, Baud gr. III. 5(which are cert ainly older than Matsya by several centuries), in Baudhāyana gxhyasesa-sutra I. 18, the Samavidhāna-brahmana III. 3.5 and several medieval works. The Baud. Gr. S. S. calls it Grhasanti and recommends that it be performed every month, every season or every year in the bright fortnight on an auspicious Dakṣatra by one who desires prosperity in his house.

<p>he makes the house sānta (se follows). He deposits gold in water that has rice and barley thrown into it, he sprinkles the house three times going round it with his right side turned towards it with the santātiya hymn (Rg. VL. 35) and he does so again three times pouring out an unbroken stream of water with the three verses &lsquo;O waters! you are wholesome&rsquo; (Rg. X. 9. 1-3). In the middle of the house he cooks boiled rice, offers from it four oblations with each of the four versos &ldquo;Vastospate pratijānihyasmān&rsquo; (Rg. VII. 54, 1-3 and VIL 55.1), should then prepare food, should feed the brāhmaṇas with it and make them say &lsquo;lucky is the house, lucky is the house.&rsquo; Some details from Baud. Gr. (III. 5) may be mentioned here. It provides that oblations are offered from cooked food with the invitatory prayer (Puronuyakyā) Vāstospate pratijānihi' (&lsquo;O Lord of houses ! accept us as your devotees,&rsquo; (Rg. VII. 54. 1, Tai, S. II. 4. 10.1) and the offering prayer (Yājyā) with Vāstospate sagmaya' (O Lord of house9, may we be endowed with fellowship with thee &amp;c. Rg. VII. 54. 3, Tai, S. III. 4. 10. 1). Then he offers āhutis of clarified butter with the mantras viz. Vāstospate dbruvā sthūṇā' (Rg. VIII, 17, 14), “gshyam bhayam yac-ced', 1282 &lsquo;akṣispande-angacale,&rsquo; &lsquo;duḥ-svapne pāpasvapne&rsquo;, &lsquo;Vastospate prataraṇo&rsquo; (O Vāstospatil mayst thou be our saviour', Rg. VIL 54. 2),&lsquo;amiyaha Vāstospate&rsquo; (O VastospatiMayst thon be our friend destroying diseases' Rg. VII. 55.1). Then he places the remainder of the food from which offerings were made on bunches of darbhas in front of the Fire with the words &lsquo;salutation to Rudra Vāstospati! I offer (oblations to him) who protects when we approach, or run, walk out, depart, turn round or return.&rsquo; Having brought together in a plate the water for cleansing the cooking vessel, the remainder of the clarified butter and the water (used in the rite) he sprinkles water therefrom on all sides with a twig of udumbara or palāśa or śami tree or with a handful of darbhas, be goes round the house thrice with his right side towards it with the verse &lsquo;tyam Vipraḥ&rsquo; (Rg. IX. 18. 2). He preparos food, honours the brāhmaṇas (with food and fees), makes them recite blessings in the words &lsquo;lucky is the house, lusky is the house&rsquo;.</p>

<p>History of Dharmaśāstra (soo. II, Oh. XXI</p>
<p>Various prognostications were based on the sounds produced by the house lizard (called palli, pallikā, kudyamatsyn or gphagodhika), by its movements and by its fall on the several limbs of a person by Vasantarāja sākuna, chap. 17 (32 yerses), the Adbhutasāgara pp. 666-568 (quoting 28 verses of Vasanta rāja), Jyotistattva pp. 706-707, śāntiratoa or Santi-kamalakara (folio 198), the Dharmasindhu (pp. 347–348). A few words based on the last two are set out here. A fall of the lizard on the right side of a male and on his head (except the chin), chest, navel and stomach is auspicious, while in the case of &amp; woman such a fall would be auspicious on the left side. The bame applies to a chameleon. If a lizard or chameleon falls on a limb or creeps up a person&rsquo;s limb the person should take a bath with clothes on and perform a śānti for removal of the inauspi ciousness or for increase of auspiciousness. If a person has a mere contact with a house lizard or chameleon he should bathe, drink pañcagarya, look into clarified butter, should pay honour to (a golden image of the lizard or chameleon clothed in a red piece of cloth, offer to the image gandha and flowers, worship Rudra in a jar full of water, offer into fire 108 fuel sticks of khadira tree to the accompaniment of the Mștyunjaya 12824 mantra and offer 1008 or 108 āhutis of sesame into fire with the vyahrtis and perform the rites from scistaksi to sprinkling with drops of water and then donate gold, clothes and sesame. 12826</p>
<p>The Yogayatrā chap. 7 (verses 1-12) and Hemadri on Vrata (vol. I pp. 894-897) mention ceremonial baths on and worship of nakṣatras from Asyin&rsquo; to Revati and their presiding deities as yielding various benefits. The Atharvana-parisista I (called naksatrakalpa) sections 37-50 deal with nakṣatrasnāna from Kșttikā to Bharapi. Sections 37-41 contain the mantras employed in worshipping and placating the presiding deities of the naksatras beginning with Kșttikā. Section 42 describes the general procedure of nakṣatraspāna; sections 43-45 set out</p>
<p>1282a. Mṛtyaõjaya maatra is the Tryamabaka mantra, according to Vidyākara quoted in Jyotistattva (p. 707). The Tryambaka mantra is &lsquo;Tryambakan yajāmabe&rsquo; (Rg, VII. 59. 12, Tai. S. 1. 8. 6. 2, Vāj. S. III, 60).</p>
<p>1282b. It is somewhat remarkable that Vasantarāja is entirely silent about the fall of the house lizard on a person&rsquo;s body and devotes thirty-two verses merely to the interpretation of the sounds of the lizard in different directions and at different times of the day and to the progaosticatlons deri ved from its movements on the walls. It is not unlikely that progaostication from the fall of the lizard on a man&rsquo;s limb was a later dovelopment.</p>
<p>Ceremonial baths on nakpatras</p>

<p>the substances to be added to the water for each nakratrasnāna and the benefit to be derived from so doing. Sections 47-50 contain special roles in relation to each naksatra from Katika to Bharani, about the distribution of food to brahmanag and gifts to be made on each naksatra together with the rewards to be expected therefrom. But the Bșhatsamhita chap. 47 (1-87), the Atharvapa-parisista V pp. 66-68, Viṣoudharmottara I, 103, Yogayātrā (VII. 13-21), the Kalikapurāpa chap. 89, end Hemādri (on Vrata vol. II, pp. 600-628) speak of a śānti called Puṣyagnana or Pusyābhiseka. It is said that Bphaspati par formed this śānti for Indra, then Vṛddha-Garga got it and he imparted it to Bhāguri. Most of the above works confine it to the king, since the king is the very root of the tree the subjects and since any harm to or welfare of that root (the king) results in misfortune or welfare of the people; therefore care must be taken for the increase of the king&rsquo;s Welfaro 17 As the treatment in the Bṭhatsamhita is the fullest and is among the most ancient descriptions, it is briefly set out here. The royal astrologer and family priest should perform the rite of Pasya spāna for the king, than which there is nothing more holy and nothing more destructive of all evil portents. This may be per formed on pusya-nakṣatra every time, but the Santi on this day when the Full Moon is in Pusya-paksatra is the highest and if such a sāna is performed without there being Pusya Daksatra on that day, then it yields only half the fruit. There is no utpūta which is not averted or mitigated by this śānti and there is no other auspicious rite which surpasses this. About Pasya the Ratnamālā 1284 states &lsquo;Just as the lion is the strongest among</p>

Then the astro loger, the councillors and officiating priests should go out from the capital at night and make an offering (bali) in the East, North or North-east and the royal family priest, being himself pure and bowing down, should invoke with fried grains, aksata, barley, curds and flowers and with a mantra 1285 the gods, the ( guardians of) quarters, the nūgas and brābmapas to be present at the spot and then say &lsquo;tomorrow you will receive worship and depart after conferring welfare on the king&rsquo;. The family priest and the others should stay in order to find the auspicious nature or otherwise of the dreams (of the king). On the next day in the morning they should collect materials (for the Puṣyasnāna) on the spot chosen the previous day. He should draw a mandala (a diagram) there and should place thereon various jewels and should design places to nāgas, yaksas, gods, pitrs, gandharvas, apsarases, sages, siddhas, planets, nakṣatras, Rudras, the māts, Skanda, Viṣṇu, Visakha, Lokapālas, goddesses ( such as Lakṣmi, Gaurl, Indrāni), which sbould all be drawn with charming coloured powders or chalk &amp;c, should offer them worship with sandal wood paste, flowers &amp;c., with various edibles, fruits and meat, with drinks viz. wine, milk and decoctions; he should follow the procedure of Grahayajña and worship the various deities invited with appropriate foods, incense, clarified butter, flowers, with lauds and salutations &amp;c. (verses 30–33). Then he should set up Agni on an altar to the west or south of the mandala drawn by him, should kindle it into flames and bring near it the materials and darbhas.

<p>declare the prognostioations derived 12004 from the flames of the sacred Agni as laid down in the chapter on the festival of Lodra&rsquo;s banner (Bṭ. S. 42. 31–36). Then the purohita with folded hands should pray 1991 &ldquo;May all the groups of gods receive the worship from the king and depart after conferring (on him) abundant prosperity and returning ( when again in voked)&rsquo;. Then the king should honour the astrologer and the purohita with plenty of wealth and (honour) according to their deserts also others, viz. men learned in the Veda and the like who are well worthy of receiving gifts. Then the king should assure safety to all subjects, ( order the) release of all animals taken to slaughter houses and release all persons put in jail except those guilty of offences against the king&rsquo;s person or his harem. Varahamibira adds ( 47. 85) that this procedure of Puṣyasnāns is commended for a king who aspires after imperial dignity or who ardently desires a son or when he is first crowned king. He further states that this very procedure of ceremonial bath should be employed in the case of the king&rsquo;s elephants and horses that then become free from diseases (verse 87).</p>
<p>A few remarks from other works may be added here. The Yoga-yatrā (chap. VII. 13-14) lays down 1292 that in the ceremonial bath clay should be collected from a mountain top, ant-hill, a river mouth, the two banks of a river, the foot of the Indra figure (in the Indradhyaja festival), (clay) dug up by the tusk of an elephant and by a bull&rsquo;s horn, (clay) from the royal palace-door and from the door of the house of a dancing girl (patronized by the king) and the king&rsquo;s head should be purified by rubbing on it the olay from a mountain top, his ears with</p>

It will be noticed that there is a suggestive symbolism in all this. The king is to hold his head high and to atta in eminence; therefore his head is to be rubbed with clay from a mountain peak.</p>
<p>It appears that nakṣatrasnāna was meant for all. For example, the Atharvana-parisista 1293 on naksatrakalpa (800. 43 p. 22) states that a Vaiśya should undergo coremonial bath on Robiṇi, being decked with all seeds, while verse 6 of the same section maintains that a brāhmaṇa who undergoes Pusyasnāna thrice with a thousand grains of red paddy and with a thousand mustard grains and with (twigs and leaves) of Sahasravirya, Ananti plants and with Madayanti and Priyangu plants acquires as much fame as a king.</p>
<p>From the Matsya-purāṇa it is clear 1294 that Pusyasnāna was an item in Lakṣahoma, undertaken by the king to counter aot the evil effects of planets. That Purāṇa has a chapter ( 267, verses 3-4) on Dovatāsnāna 1295 where also provision is made for casting clay into the jar, clay being collected from the tusk of an elephant, from a horse (stable), public road, ant-hill, (clay ) dug up by a boar (with its tuak), from the shed where sacred fire is kept, from a tirtha (holy spot), cowpen and from the place where cows Crowd.</p>
<p>The Viṣoudharmottara (II. 103. 1-10) provides that Bārhas patyasnāna (i. e. Puṣyasnāna, Brbaspati being the presiding deity of Pusya) should be performed in the bright half, in the</p>

<p>northern passage of the sun, on an auspicious day, pakṣatra and muhurta or when the moon is in Puṣya or Rohini nakṣatra or in Hasta or Sravana; two square mandalas of eight cubits on each of four sides should be made, one for offering bali and the other for an altar on which a fire is to be established, both being decked with various things. Four jars with waters of springs should be placed in each of the two mandalas, and also seven jars filled with seeds, corn and precious stones, one for being decked with leaves of trees and the other with flowers and fruits. It appears (verses 12-13) that the Viṣnudharmottara contemplates Pusyasnāna for the three higher varpas, 12% since it provides that a brāhmaṇa should sit on the hide of a bull as his seat, a kṣatriya may employ the hides of a lion and tiger and a vaisya on the hides of a tiger and leopard. It provides mantras other than those mentioned by Varahamihira. It provides that this rite of Pusyasnāna should go on for seven days and that the person undergoing it should give up during those days wine, meat, honey and sexual intercourse (verse 29 ). This Puṣyasnāna drives away all ill-luck, destroys evil spirits, brightens the intellect, confers health, brilliance and fame, kills enemies, is auspicious, destroys sing and the evil effects of strife and bad dreams (versos 30-31).</p>
<p>It should be borne in mind that a rite on Puṣya for pros perity called Pusya-vrata is mentioned by so early a work 88 the Apastambadharma-sūtra (for which p. 346 above may be referred to).</p>
<p>In Bphadyogayātrā (chap. XIII. 1-10), Matsyapurāṇa (chap. 241. 1-14) and in Vasantarāja (chap. VI. 4. 1-14 pp. 87 92) a good deal is said about prognostications derived from the throbbing ( spandana or sphurana) of the several parts of a man&rsquo;s body. All the three often closely agree in words and ideas as the notes below will clearly show. There is hardly any doubt that Vasantarāja&rsquo;s treatment is based on the other two works. It is difficult to decide whether Varāhamihira borrows from the Matsya or vice versa or whether both borrow from a common source. It is not unlikely that Varāhamihira might</p>

<p>have followed the Mataya. They all agree that throbbing 1997 of the right side of the body is auspicious and of the left Induspl cious in the case of males, while the reverse is true in the case of women. They all set out the consequences indicated by the throbbing of the several parts and limbs of the body from the top of the head to the soles of the feet. To get out all these in detail would occupy much space. A few are mentioned by way of illustration. The fruit indicated by the throbbing of the top of the 129 head is the acquisition of land (or earth); of the forehead, the prosperity of the position already occupied; of the region between the eyebrows and nose, union with persons dear to one; of the region of the eye, death; of the portion near the eye the acquisition of wealth; of the upper arm, union with friends; of the hand, the acquisition of wealth; of the back, defeat; of the chest, success; of the upper part of the foot, the securing of a position; of the soles, journey with gain therein. The Matsya-purana 1299 prescribes that when inauspicious indica tions (by throbbing) occur, brahmanas should be placated with the gift of gold</p>
<p>From ancient times the throbbing of the limbs, particularly of the arm and eye, have been regarded in India as the harbin gers of coming events, auspicious or inauspicious. Manu prohibits &amp; sannyāsin ( parivrājake) from obtaining alms by means of declaring prognostications from utpātas or nimittas, from nakṣatras and from Angavidyā eto. In the Sākuntala</p>

<p>Throbbing of arms and eyes</p>
<p>801</p>
<p>Kalidasa twice mentions the throbbing of the arm of the hero ag indicative of good fortune and the throbbing of the right eye of Sakuntala as presaging 1300 misfortune. Shakespeare in “Othello&rdquo; makes Desdemona speak about the itobing of her eyes as a bad omen. The Bṛhad-yogayātrā (XILL, 10), Bļ. 8. (51.10) and Vasantarāja declare that the throbbing of moles, boils, marks, eruptions (on limbs) are to be deemed to indicate consequences similar to the limbs on which they exist. 1301</p>
<p>The Bșhatsamhita (chap 93 vorges 1-14), Bṛhadyogayātrā (chap. 21 verses 1303 1-21 ) and Yogayātrā (chap. 10 verses 1-15) dwell at length on the prognostications to be drawn from the arrangement of the tusks of elephants, from the marks geen when the tusks are cut, from the tired appearance and more ments of elephants, particularly when the king is to march on an invasion, since as the Yogayatrā says the king&rsquo;s victory depends on elephants.2303 These, however, do pot describe any śānti and are hence passed over hore as not relevant to the subject of sintis. But the Agnipurana (chap. 291 verses 1-24). Visṇudharmottara (II. 50.1-93), Baud. gphyagaṣasūtra I 20 and Hemādri (on Vrata, vol. IL pp. 1036–1051) prosoribe santia for removing diseases of elephants and therefore a brief zote is added here from Baud. gphyasosa-sūtra, which is probably the earliest and simplest description of a Gajaśānti</p>

I. 4. 8. 1); he then leads the elephant to its place (stable); the elephant becomes long-lived; so says the adorable Baudhāyana.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Gajaśānti in Agnipurāna (chap. 291) is entirely differ ent from the above. One should worship on the 5th tithi of the bright half Viṣnu, Lakṣmi, the Airāvata 1308 elephant and the other elephants (in all eight) and Brahmā, Saṅkara, Indra, Kubera, Yama, the Sun and the Moon, Varuna, Vāyu, Agni, the Karth and Akāśa. The elephants should be sprinkled with sāntyudaka (propitiatory water). The Agnipurāṇa proposes an elaborate worship, on a lotus-shaped diagram drawn on an altar, of several gods, several weapons, sages, rivers and mountains &amp;c., elephants &amp;o. and provides that an astrologer should ride the principal elephant of the king and say into its ear &lsquo;you are made the chief of elephants, the king will honour you with gandho, flowers, best food and people at the order of the king will honour you; you should protect the king in battle, in his journey and in his palace. You should forget that you are a more beast and revolve in your mind that you are divine !&rsquo; &amp;c. The king should then ride such an elephant and armed warriors should follow and various gifts should be made to the elephant keeper, the astrol oger, the scārya &amp;o.</p>
<p>The Viṣnudharmottare (II. 50.1-93) is far more elaborate than even the Agnipurāṇa. Its verses about the words to be muttered in the ear of the elephant (II. 50. 59-64) are the same as those in the Agni (291, 15-20). The Viṣnudharmottara adds (II. 50. 68-70) that this sānti should not be performed on the 4th 9th or 14th tithi nor on Tuesday nor on Saturday and the com mended naksatras are Jyeṣtha, Citra and Sravana and that this bānti rite for elephants destroya all danger to elephants.</p>

<p>History of Dharmaśāstra (Soo. III, Ch. XX</p>
<p>those verses occur in the Hastyāyurveda (Anandasrama ed.) chapters 35 and 36. Considerations of space and of importance prevent any desoription of that sānti derived from the Hasty ayurveda</p>
<p>The Bṛhatsamhita (chap. 92. 1-14), the Bṛhadyogayātra ( 22. 1-21 ) and the Yogayātrā (XI, 1-14) deal with the movements, neighing, prancing, striking the ground with hoofs, postures of horses from which lucky or unlucky consequences are to be inferred. But they do not describe any śānti and therefore are passed over. The Agnipurāṇa (chap. 290, 1-8), the Viṣnu dharmottara (II, 47. 1-42), Baud. gphysosasūtra 1 19 and Hemādri (on vrata, vol. II, pp. 1031-36 taken from Salihotra ) describe a śānti which aperts all dangers to horses and removes their diseases.</p>
<p>The sānti from Baudhāyana is as follows:- &ldquo;having carried out the usual details of an ordinary homa from drawing the lines onwards (the priest) offers into Agni oblations from the cooked food after reciting the puronuvākyā (invitatory prayer) &lsquo;tadaśvināśvayujopayātām&rsquo; (May the Asyins that yoka horses come near, Tai. Br. III. 1. 2. 10) and the yājyā ( offering prayer) &lsquo;yau devānām bhisajau&rsquo; (&lsquo;that are physicians of the gods&rsquo;, Tai. Br. III. 1. 2. 11). Then he makes additional offerings with clarified butter szāhū to Aśvins, svāhā to the two that yoke horses, stāhā to the ear, svāhā to hearing&rsquo; (Tai. Bṛ. III. 1. 6. 13). Then he performs all details from sviṣtakrt offering to the gift of a cow. Then he puts down on Aśvattha leaves in front of Agni the food remaining after the offering of cooked food with the mantra&rsquo;yo aśvatthaḥ&hellip; ketubhiḥ saha&rsquo;( Tai. Br. I. 2. 1. 8 9). He brings together in a plate the water with which the athalt is washed, the remainder of the clarified butter and of the water, sprinkles drops from it with an Aśvattha twig and goos round the horses thrice with his right towards the horses with the anuvāka beginning with &lsquo;yo yā aśv9sya medbyasya lomāni teda&rsquo; (he who knows the hair of the holy horse). So said the adorable Baudhāyana.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sāntis are connected with sakunas also. The word sakuna means a bird&rsquo; in the Roveda (IV. 26. 6, IX. 86. 13, IX. 96. 19 and 23, IX. 107. 20, IX. 11%. 2, X 68.7, X. 123. 6, X. 165. 2) and is &amp; synonym of sakuni (Rg. II. 42. 1, II. 43, 2 and 3) and fakunti (Rg. II, 42, 3, II. 43. 1). In Rg. X. 16. 6 (yat te kropah sakuna ātutoda) the crow is referred to as the dark bird&rsquo;. It has been seen above that birds like kapota were regarded even</p>
<p>Sakunas</p>
<p>805</p>
<p>in the Rgveda as harbingers of impending evil and misfortune. Hence the word sakuna gradually came to mean premonition of evil Conveyed by cries, movements, positions of birds and then any prognosticatory siga (not necessarily connected with birds). There is an extensive literature on sakunas. Some of it is mentioned here, viz. the Matsyapurāṇa (chap. 237, 241, 243 ), Agnipurāna (chap. 230-232), Viṣnudharmottarapurāṇa L 163 164, Padmapurāṇa (IV. 100.65–126), Bșhat-ramhita (chap. 85 95), Bṛhad-yogayātrā (chap. 23-27), Yogayātra (chap. 14), the Nimitta of Bhadrabāhu (ma. in Bhau Daji collection of BBRAS No. 385 in Prof. Volankar&rsquo;s Catalogue pp. 126-127), Vasantarāja sūkuna, 1309 Mānasollāsa of king Someśvara Cālukya ( 1126-1138</p>

<li>Vasantaraja&rsquo;s work on &lsquo;sakudas&rsquo; was published by the Venkate. svara Press, Bombay (1906 A. D.), with the Sanskrit commentary of Bhānucandragani, who was patronized by Emperor Akbar (in the latter half of the 16th century A.D.) and a Hindi translation by Sridhar Jatasankara Bhatta. As Vasaataraja is quoted by Adbhuta-sāgara which was begun in saka 1089 (1167 A. D.), it follows that Vasantarāja would have to be placed before 1100 A. D. He is probably aot much earlier than 700 A. D. as he does not appear to have been mentioned by Utpala in his extensive commentaries on Varībamibira&rsquo;s works. Vasantarāja tells as (in the Introductory verses 3-5) that he was the son of Vijayarājabhatta and Sarasvati and the younger brother of Sivarāja, that he was honoured by king Candradeva (klag of Mithilā, acc. to the Com.) and composed the work on sakuda at the request of that king. He mentions (1. 10) Cūdāmaṇi, jyotina-Sastra, bora-astra and Svarodaya and (in I. 27) informs us that Atri, Garga, Goru, sutra, Vasiṣgha, Vyisa, Kautsa, Burgu and Gautama were the principal ancient sages that declared the knowledge of sakogas for the benefit (of human beings). Cūdāmagi is rather an early work quoted in the Sārāvali (5. 20 and 39, 8) of Kalyāṇavarman in the same breath with Varāhamibira,</li>

<p>The Nimitta attributed to Bhadrababo is an extensive work contalaing 26 chapters and about 1460 verses. It is described in the colophon at the end as &lsquo;naigranthe (nairgranthe?) Bhadrabāhuke Nimitte svapoadbyāyah&rsquo;. The first chapter states that in the time of king Senajit at Rajagrha in Magadba pupils asked Bhadrababu to expound to them the nimittas and ho did so, He is styled (in chap. II. 1) a digambara and the best of śramanas. The contents of chapters 2 to 26 are: Uikā (meteors), balo, lightning, avealng glow, clouds, winds and barricades, rain-fall, gandbarvanagara (Fata Morgana), narch of kings on invasion, portents affecting the king and the country due to the ripening of actions in former lives (chap. XIV bas 177 verses on this), grabacāra as declared by Jina (chap. XV, 227 verses), the prognosticatory movements of Venus, Saturn, Japiter, Mercary, Mars, Rabu, Ketu, the Sun and the Moon: grahayuddha; conjunctions of planets; dreams. It appears that the work is later thao Varahamibita, As it is not within the pale of Dharmasastra Literature and hardly ever describes a saati in the way in which the Porānas and medieval dharmasastra works provide it has been referred to in this work only rarely,</p>

<p>A. D.) II, 13 pp. 102-112, Adbhutasagara (which profusely quotes Vasantarāja&rsquo;s work), Rājanitiprakasa (pp. 345-347). Among these Vasantarāja-śākuna is the most comprehensive work on the subject of sakunas and has been quoted by the Adbhutesāgara and other later works. A brief account of the work would not be out of place and is given here. It is divided into twenty vargas 1310 ( sections) and contains in different metres 1525 verses ( as stated in varga II. 12). It states; it would declare the sakunas 2311 indicated in this world by groups of beings viz. bipeds (mon and birds), quadrupeds (elephants, horses &amp;c.), six-footed (bees), eight-footed (the mythical animal sarabba), beings having many foot (such as a scorpion) and having no feet ( such as snakes); that is called sakuna which is the means of arriving at definite knowledge about auspicious or inauspicious consequences viz. movement (to the left, to the right &amp;c.), the sounds or cries (of birds and beasts), their glances and activities. A person who is an expert in sakuna bastra, knowing that a certain object of his would involve difficulties or would be without difficulties, abandons it or begins it respectively. The work boasts that if it be well studied it requires no expounder, no mathematics and that by merely studying it, the reader acquires pleasant knowledge that yields rewards. The work repeats the view of Varāhamihira (in Bșhat gamhitā 85.5 and on p.558 above in n. 827) that sakunas indicate to men, whether going on a journey or residing in their houses, how the consequences of actions done in past lives will certainly bear fruit. He answers the objection that, if no man can escape his fate and has to reap the rewards of his past actions, this bāstra is of no use, by saying that the actions of former lives bear fruit only at certain times and places and &amp; man can avoid the rosults of past actions just as he avoids snakes, fire, poison,</p>

<p>History of Dharmalastra [Sec. III, Oh.XXI</p>
<p>A noticeable feature of Vasantarāja&rsquo;s work is that more than half of it (781 verses) is devoted to the sounds 1312 made by three birds viz Syama (400 Verses), crow (187) Pingalika (200) and that 312 verses are devoted to the barking, movements and howling of dogs (verses 222) and female jackals (verses 90 ). It is remarkable that among the Sāktas it is believed that a female jackal is a messenger of Kāli and is auspicious and on hearing its howl in the early morning a person should offer salutation and then success is in the hands of the sādhaka. The brief contents set out above will show that he extends the meaning of sakuna so as to include prognostications based on the sotions of men and beasts. He himself says at the end that 1313 is sakuna, which in this world is remembered, heard, touched or seen or which is declared in dreams, since they all yield resulta. He claims that the system of sakunag is as authoritative as the Vedas, smrtis and puranas, since it nover fails to convey correct knowledge. 1314 Some of his interesting statements may be briefly set out. If an owl hoot at night on the top of a house that portends 1315 sorrow and the death of the owner&rsquo;s son (VIII. 40). This is in line with modern popular belief in India. The cawing of crows is at the head of all prognosticatory sounds. The barking of dogs is the essence among all sakunas.&rsquo; The Brhad-yogayatra. 1316 provides that certain animals and birds are useless for prognostications at certain seasons viz. the rohita (red) deer, horse, goat, ass, deer, oamel, hare, are useless in winter (siśira); Crow and cuckoo aro</p>

Vasantarāja in IV. 47-48 pp. 56-57 has the same provisions almost word for word. Vasantaraja&rsquo;s work appears to have been based mainly on Varahamihira&rsquo;s Bphat-samhitā section on sakuna, chapters 85 to 95 (321 versos ) in which Varābamihira devotes 47 verses in chap. 85 to the cries of birds in general, deals with the movements and barking of dogs (88. 1-20) and female jackals (89. 1-15), the cries of crows (62 verses in chap. 94), to horses (9%. 1-15), elephants (94. 1-14) and cows (90. 1-3).</p>

<p>Vasantarāja states 1317 that there are five excellent ones in the matter of śakunas viz. the Podaki bird, dog, crow, pingalā. bird and the female jaokal. Sarasvati is the presiding deity of podaki, Yakṣa ( Kubera ) of dog, eagle of crow, Candi of pinga likā and the friend of Pārvati of the female jackal. He further says that all animals and birds are presided over by deitios; therefore a person who interprets sakunas should not kill them, as deities prosiding over them might become angry. His state ments about &lsquo;upaśruti&rsquo; (oracular voices or words) are worth citing. &lsquo;At the time of pradosa or about the morning twilight when people are bardly speaking anything, a person that is ready to undertake any matter (business) should consider everywhere oracular voices. What a child says without being prompted to do so would not turn out to be untrue even at the end of a Yuga. No such easily understood and true sakuna exists for men other than upaśruti.&rsquo; Both Mārasollasa (II 13, Versos 920-926 pp. 112-113) and Vasantarāja (VI pp. 78-80 Versos 5-12) describe a curious mode of divining the future called upaśruti: 1318 When all people are asleep and the publio ____1317. पोदकी भषणकाकपिङ्गला जमाकमियतमा च पशमी। एतदव सुनिसचमः सदा कोत्पते शकुनरत्नपञ्चकम् ॥ सरस्वती पाण्डषिकामधानां यक्षोपि यक्षं गश्च काकम्। चण्डी ga: font free farat forargrafierereito TST III. 3-4, pp. 22–23; Flat पुराणम्। याशिवाविवत शुत्वा शिवदूती शुभप्रदाम् । प्रणमेसाधको भूत्वा तस्य कामाः करे FUNT: # *** (Jiv.

They should take with them the kudara measure with Gaṇośa image inside and repair to the house of a washerman. In front of that house they should cast white akṣata grains after (silently ) revolving in their mind their thoughts (the matter they are intent on). Then they should with concentrated mind listen. When they hear any words coming from inside of the house talked by a man, a woman or a child or any one else uttered at pleasure (or without restraint of any kind), auspicious, or inauspicious, they should consider the sense of the words heard and the conclusion drawn as to the future project from the words would not turn out to be untrue.

<p>811</p>
<p>A pocular mode akin to paśrati is described in the Padmapurana, Patalakhanda, chap 100 verses 65-166. It is narrated in that chapter that Bibhiṣans was put in chains by Dravidas when the fomer saw Siva-liiga established by Rāma at Ramaśvara and when no one could explain how it happened, Rama questioned Sambhu himself who explained that the Puranas (mentioned in verses 51-53) may be employed as containing prognosticatory words. The procedure is that a maiden more than five years of age and less than ton years or any girl who has not attained puberty may be honoured with gandha, flowers, incense and other upacaras, she should be made to recite the words &lsquo;speak the troth, speak what is agrogable, O blessed Sarasvati! salutation to you, salutation to you!* Sha should be given three pairs of dūryā grass and she should be asked to cast them between two leaves of the book. The verse between two leaves would be indicative of sucoass in the under taking. The verse should be carefully considared and its meaning settled and applied to the matter in hand. This is like sortes sanctorum a sortes Vergilianae i d. divination by opening at random the Scriptures or a book of Virgil or by pricking the text with a pin. Then directions are given as to what should be done if the leaves are half burnt or indistinct &amp;c. and it is said that one should look upon the verge as sent by fato like the words in the upaśruti method.1319 It is further stated that this method should not be resorted to every day, but rarely and that then one should worship the Purana the propious night and in the morning should consult the Purāṇa for sakuna (verses 114 116). The Skanda is the best among all Puranas for this purpose of śakuna; some hold that the Visgupurīga and the Ramayana also may be consulted, but the author of the Padma says that Viṣnupurāṇa may not be used for this purpose, since if a man devoid of proper conduct honours it for consultation, then inauspicious indications come out (verses 122–125). Sambhu himself worshipped Skanda-puraṅa, asked the question why Bibhiṣana, devotee of Siya, had fetters put on him (verses 131 132). Then three verses were seen that gave indications (verses 133–135), two of which 1320 are cited below. At the end the</p>

<p>A similar method of finding out omens and of divination from the two works of the great Hindi poet and saint Tulasidas ( born in satinat 1589 i. e. 1532 A, D.) viz. Rāmājñā (or Rāma sakunāvali containing 343 doha verses ) and Rāmasalāka is described at some length by G. A. Grierson in I. A. VOL. XXII pp. 204 ff and in Festgabe E. Jacobi pp. 449-455.</p>
<p>It is worthy of note that even scientific works like the Carakasamhitā ask the physician to notice the condition of the patient, of the messenger, and the actions of the physician and inauspicious omens. They are described in Indriyasthāna chap. 12. A fow notable verses may be cited here. That patient would only live for a month on whose head arises only powder ( dandruff or the like ) resembling the powder of dry cowdung and that slides down ( from the head); that patient will not live even for a fortnight whose chest dries up when he takes a bath and anoints his body with sandalwood paste while all other limbs are yet wet&rsquo; (verse 12). &ldquo;Those messengers from a patient who come to a physician when the latter is offering oblations into fire or is offering piṇdas to his pitrs, will kill the patient (i. e. indicate the approaching death of the patient, Verse 16 ); a woman who is in a pitiable state, terrified, hurried, troubled, dirty and unchaste, three persons ( coming together), deformed persons, impotent persons-these are messengers of those who are about to die&rsquo; ( verses 21–22 ); a physioian should not go ( to see a patient) on being called by a messenger when the physician sees, while the messenger is describing the condi. tion of the patient, an inauspicious omon or a sorrowing man or a corpse or the decoration meant for the dead&rsquo;; verses 67–70 dilate on the signs of an auspicious messenger and verses 71-79 set out auspicious omens such as the sight of curds, whole grains, brāhmaṇas, bulls, king, jewels, jar full of water, white borse &amp;o. The physician is however advised not to declare an inauspicious omen even when he sees it that would give a shock or cause pain to the patient or even to anyone else ( verse 63 ).</p>

<p>SECTION IV THE PURĀNAS AND DHARMAŚĀSTRA</p>
<p>CHAPTER XXII Origin and development of Purāna literature</p>
<p>The History of Dharmaśāstra (vol I pp. 160-167 ) has a hrief chapter on the Puranas. It has been shown tharsin how the Taittiriya Arapyaka, the Chandogya and Bṛbadaranyaka Upanisads mention Itihasa and Purana (sometimes callectively as &lsquo;Itihasapuradam&rsquo; and sometimes separately as &lsquo;Itibasah Purāpam&rsquo;) and how some of the extant Parāṇas are minch varlier than the 6th century A.D. It is further pointed out there that the number of the principal Puranag has been traditionally handed down as eighteen, 324 that some para as much as the Matsya, the Vispu, the Vayu and Bhavisya contain mich Dharms śāstra material, that the Garuda-purana and the Aguipurna contain several bundred verses each that are identical with verste of the Yājñavalkya amrti, that there is great divergence as to the extent of almost all Purapas, that some of the Paranas that selves enumerate minor works called Upaparabas, that the Puranas are divided into three groups, vis sātlaku, rajasa and tāmasa (as done by Garuda L 223. 17-20, and Padma VL. 263. 81-84). Details were also farnished as to the chapters of the Puranas in which the several topics of Dharmasastra (ch as ācāra, āhnika, dana, röjadharma, fuddha, tirtha ) were dealt with</p>

<p>History of Dharmuusāstra [ Soc. IV, Ch. XXII</p>
<p>goes back much farther than was pointed out in the H. of DH. vol. I. p. 160. The Atharvaveda 1325 mentions Purāna (in the singular) in XI. 7. 24 and XV. 6. 10-11. The çk and saman verses, the chandas, the Purāṇa along with the Yajus formula, all sprang from the remainder of sacrificial food, ( as also ) the gods that resort to heaven. He changed his place and went over to great direction; and Itihasa and Purana, gathās, verses in praise of heroes followed in going over.&rsquo; The Satapatha brahmana also (XI. 5. 6.8) mentions &lsquo;Itihasapuranam&rsquo; (as one compound word) and states that on the 9th day of the Pāriplava the hott priest instructs among other matters as follows: &lsquo;The Purāna is the Veda; this it is ; thus saying let him narrate some Purana ' (XIII 4. 3. 13.). 1326 The Saṅkhayana tan Srautasutra (XVI. 2.27) and the Aivalayana rauta (X.7) remark that on two days of the Pāriplava the Itihāsaveda and Purāṇaveda were to be recited. But the two sūtras ( though affiliated to the Rgveda ) differ as to the day on which they were to be recited. It is difficult to say whether the Atharvaveda, the Satapatha Brāhmaṇa and the Upaniṣads know several works called Purāṇa or whether there was only a single work called</p>

It is not unlikely that, whare the singular Purānam&rsquo; was employed in the Vedic texte, s class of works was meant. The facts that Ibihass-Purāpa&rsquo; is called the fifth Voda in the Upanisads and that the Satapatha employs Itibāsa-Purānamas one compound word bead to the inference that the two categories Itihase&rsquo; and &lsquo;Purana&rsquo; more similar in contents at least in several respects. The Apestambo dharmasūtra 1328 quotes two vorses each in two places from a Purana ( in the singular ), once cites the view of the Bhavisyat purāpa and in another place gives the summary of a Purana passage or verse which says that, whan 8 person attacks another</p>

<p>with the object of harming him and the person attacked kills the attaoker, no sin is incurred. From these passages it is clear that Apastamba had before him a Purāṇa called Bhavisyat and also that the Purana or Purāṇas which he knew contained rules about the food to be accepted for eating, about the stages of householder and the perpetual student, about resisting an ātatāyin oven unto death and about creation and re-creation after dissolution. These matters fall within the province of Smrtis and Purāṇas. As the word &lsquo;purāṇa&rsquo; means &lsquo;ancient&rsquo;, the word Bhavisyat-purāṇa is a contradiotion in terms. Long before Āpastamba the word Purāna had come to mean a work dealing with ancient tales &amp;o; several such works must have been composed and they probably began to incorporate contem porary events and wrote about such events in a prophetio vein. Hence arose the name Bhavisyat-purāna. 2329 As Apastambe mentions a Bhavisyat-purāṇa and also Purāṇa, it follows that before 500 B. C. several Purāpas existed one of which was called the Bhavisyat and the Purāṇas then known contained the topics of sarga, pratisarga and smrti matters.</p>
<p>This conclusion is strongly corroborated by other facts. The Gautama-dharmasūtra provides that a learned (bahusruta) brahmana is one who knows peoples&rsquo; usages, the Veda, the angas (auxiliary lorës), Vākovākya (dialogues), Itihāsa and Purāṇa and that the king in administering the affairs of his kingdom and justice has to depend upon the Veda, Dharmasastra, the (six) angas of the Veda, the (four) Upavadas and Purāṇa. 1330</p>
<p>From the above discussion it appears that, though we are not in a position to make definite statements about the contents of the Purāṇa or Purāṇas referred to in the Atharva, Sat. Br., Tai. Ār. and the Upaniṣads, by the time of Āp. and Gautama, Purāpas approaching in contents to some extent at least some of the extant Purāṇas had come into existence. The</p>

<p>Manusmrti 1336 provides that in a sraddha rite the brahmaṇas invited for dinner should recite the Vedas, the Dharmadāstras, stories, Itihāsas, Puranas and khila hymns (such as Srigūkta), it should be taken as referring to Purāṇa works closely resembl ing the extant ones. The Yājñavalkya1337 smrti enumeratos the fourteen Vidyāsthānas (branches of knowledge) and sources of dharma as Purāṇa, Nyāya (logic), Mināmsā (rules of Vedic interpretation), Dharmaśāstras, the angas of the Veda and the (four) Vedas. These fourteen are probably arranged in the order of importance and authoritativeness at the time of the Yājāavalkya-smrti. Yāj. refers to sages that expounded or promulgated the Vedas, Purāṇas, the vidyās (six angas), the Upaniṣads, the slokas (itihāga?), aphoristic works (like those of Jaimini or on nyāya), the bhāsyas and whatever other literature exists. In another place Yāj. recommends that a householder after a bath in the morning and worship of gods and pitṛs should engage in japa-yajās, in which he should mutter according to his ability parts of the Veda, of Atharvaveda, Itibāga and Puranas and philosophical texts. These passages from Yājña valkya establish that Itibāsa and Purana went together, that both were works distinct from Vedic Literature and that both had attained a status of sacredness and authoritativeness in matters of dharma in the time of the Yājñavalkya-smrti not later than 3rd century (A. D.). A Vārtika mentioned by the Mahābhāṣya on Pāe IV. 2. 59-60 provides for the formation of words with the affix' thak' (ika) in the case of akhyāna (auch as Yāvakritika, Yāyātika), ākhyāyikā (such as Vasavadattika, Saumanottarika), itihāsa (aitibāsika), Purāṇa (paurāṇika) in the sense of one who studies or knows that. 1338 In numerous passages the Mahābhārata mentions Purāṇa in the singular</p>

B It is impossible to hold that all the numerous references to Puranas are later interpolations, though a few may be go. It is not correct to say that no Purāṇa resembling the extant ones existed before the time when Purāṇa stories were collected in the Maha bharata. There is hardly any evidence to support any such view.</p>
<p>Early Sanskrit authors like Bapa (first half of 7th century A D.) and commentators like Sabara (not later than between 200-400 A. D.), Kumārila (7th century A. D.), Saṅkarācārya (between 650-800 A. D.) and Viśvarūpa (800-850 A. D.) leave us in no doubt that in their times Purāpas existed, the contents of which were just like those of the extant Purānas. Sabara in his bhāsya 1341 on Jaimini X. 4. 23, while discussing the question as to what is meant by devata in relation to sacrifices, states that one view was that they are agai and others, that are described in the Itihāsa and Puranas as dwelling in heaven. Bāpa in his Kadambari and Harsacarita frequently refers to the Mahābhārata &amp;rd Parapas, but two passages from the Kādambari and one from the Harṣacarita are very interesting.

In the Uttarabhāga (by the son of Bāpa) of the Kadambari it is stated that in all āgamas (sacred works tradition ally handed down) such as Purāṇas, Rāmāyana and Bhārata thore are many stories about curses. The placing of Purāpas first shows that they were probably more honoured or popular than the Rāmāyaṇa and the Bhārata. In the Harṣacarita 1343 it is stated that the book-roader Sudrsṭi treated Bana and his relatives and friends to a musical recitation of the Purāpa promulgated by Vāyu, that was sung by the sage (Vyāsa), that is very exten give, that is world-wide (ie, known everywhere), that is holy and that is not different from the career of Harṣa ( to which also all the adjectives applied to the Purāna are applicable). Here it appears that the Vāyu is expressly mentioned (as Pava mānaprokta and Pūrana) and it is further stated that the Puranas contained a description of the several divisions of the world. This description applies to such Purāpas as the Vayu, Matsya (chapters 114-128), Brabmaṇda (II. 15 ff). It may be argued that the Purāṇa mentioned by Bāna may be the Brah mānda since that Purāna says 1343, in the beginning as well as at the end (IV. 4. 58ff) that Brahmā impartod it to Vāyu, from whom it passed on to several divine and semi-divine personages and ultimately sūta received it from Vyāsa. This latter argu ment is not acceptable, since there was nothing to prevent Bana from expressly saying that the Brahmānda was the Purāṇa recited by Sudrsti.</p>

<p>Kumarila and Puranas</p>
<p>Kumārlabhatte in his Tantravāztika refers in several places to the Puranas and their contente. A fee interesting passages are set out here: On Jaimini 13,1 Kumirila sy $34</p>
<p>• Therefore the authoritativeness of all smrtis is stablished by the purpose which they serve; whatever therein (in smitis) in connected with dharma and moka (is authoritative), becarise it springs from (is based on the Veda; whatever concerns wealth (artha ) and pleasures is based on the usage of the people. In this way a distinction is to be made. Thk yezy reasoning applies to hortatory passages in the Itzhost and Purinas. The Upākhyānas may be explained by the reasoning applicable to arthavādas (i. e. they have a purpose and antiarita tiveness just like the commendatory passages of the Veda). Narration of the divisions of the earth serves the purpose of distinguishing the regions for undergoing the consequence of the (actions that are the ) means of tharma and adharma and are partly based on personal experience and partly on the Veda. The orderly presentation of variśas (dynasties) in the Puridas is intended to facilitate the knowledge of the brabrapa and ksatriya castes and their gotras and is based on actual experi ence and traditional knowledge; countries and measures of times are intended to facilitate worldly transactions and astronomnical Deeds and are based on actual perception, mathematian tradition and inference. The narration of wbat will happen in the future is based on the Veda, since it conveys knowledge of the variety of the ripening of the consequences of (complying with) dharna and of adharma and knowledge of the characteristics of fugas that have been in operation from time immemorial&rdquo; is clear from this passage that the Itibāsa and the Parasas that Kumārila kney contained stories, geography of the eartta dynastic liste, measures of time and description of what will happen in the future. These are matters dealt with in the axtant Parāpas. On Jaimini I 3.7 Kumirila obarys: &lsquo;In the</p>

<p>History of Dharmaśāstra (Soo. IV, Ch. XXII</p>
<p>Purānas 1345 it is narrated that in the Kali age there will arise Śakya (Gautama Buddha) and others that will cause confusion about dharma; who would listen to their worda ?&rsquo; This shows that before the 7th century A. D. the Purāṇas contained descrip tions of the nature of Kaliyuga and that the Purāṇas Kumārila knew did not regard Buddha as an avatāra of Viṣnu, but rather condemned him. From the facts that Kṣemendra composed his Daśāvatāracarita in 1066 A. D., that Aparārka (on p. 338 ) quotes a long passage from the Matsya chapter 285, verse seven of which enumerates the ton avatāras of Viṣou (including Buddha), and that the Gitagovinda of Jayadeva regards Buddha as an avatāra, it follows that before 1000 A. D. Buddha bad come to be regarded as an avatāra of Viṣnu, though before the 7th century some Purānas at least had condemned him. In the discussion of the meaning of the word &lsquo;svarga&rsquo; 134 Kumārila asks: does it mean the region of the stars or does it mean the top of the Meru (mountain) in conformity with Itihāsa and Purāṇas or does it mean only a state of happiness? This indicates that in Kumārila&rsquo;s day Purāṇas contained descriptions of the top of Moru as &lsquo;heaven.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Saṅkarācārya in his bhāsya on the Vedāntasūtra frequently mentions the contents and characteristic features of Purāṇas that are the same as those of the extant ones, though he actually names none of them. For example, on V.S. IL 1. 36 he remarks that it has been established in the Purāṇa that there is no limit to the number of past and futuro 1347 kalpas. On V. 8. I. 3.30.</p>

On v.S.III. 1. 15 (apics sapta) the bhāsya remarks that those who have studied or who know the Puranas declare that there are seven holla, Raurava and others, that are regarded as places reached for undergoing the con sequences of evil deeds committed by sinners The Visruparāža enumerates seven hells viz.

<p>History of Dharmaśāstra (Beo. IV, Ch. XXII</p>
<p>remarks that this theory ooncerning the creation and dissolution of the world is found everywhere in the Puranas. On Yaj. III. 175 which states that the path to the world of the pitȚs lios between the star Agastya (Canopus) and the Ajavithi, Viśvarūpa remarks that in the Purāṇa several vithis ( i. e. Courses ) of the Sun in the sky are found and that Ajavithi is immediately contiguous to Agastya.</p>
<p>From the foregoing discussion about the references to Puranas contained in writers from Sabara to Viśvarūpa it follows that between about the 2nd century AD, and the 6th or 7th century AD. the Purāṇas exhibited the same contents and characteristics as many of the extant Purānas do.</p>
<p>Before proceeding further, it is necessary to say here some thing about the Yuga-purāṇa, a part of the Gārgi-Samhitā, and one of the earliest extant works bearing the title Purāṇas. Kern in his Introduction to the Bṭhatsambitā (pp. 32-40 ) brought this rare Purāṇa containing valuable historical data to the notice of scholars from a fragmentary ms. Later on K. P. Jayaswal 1348, published a text of the purely historical material of the Yugapurāna in 115 half lines in Anustubh metre based on the fragment that Kern had got and two more mss. that were secured by him and added a translation and notes. Later on Jayaswal obtained a copy made by Prof. Levi from a ms, (in Bengali script) in the Bibliotheque Nationale of Paris and published in JBORS. (vol. XV pp. 129-133) a table comparing the readings of that ms with the text he published in JBORS. vol. XIV. Prof. K. H. Dhruva contributed a paper on the text of the Yugapurāṇa to the JBORS. vol. XVI. pp. 18-66, wherein he altered the proper names and gave free scope to his con jectures and inforences with the result that succeeding scholars have not attached any weight to his emendations and remarks, Prof. D. K. Mankad 13485 published &amp; monograph in which he gave the text of the historical portion based on the mss. utilized</p>

<p>The Yugapuraza</p>
<p>827</p>
<p>by Jayaswal and a fresh mus. that he obtained in Saurastra, corrects some of the readings accepted by Jayaswal and considerably differs from some of Jayaswal&rsquo;s interpretations and added a few notes.</p>
<p>The Yugapurapa is the 113th chapter of Gārglsarbitā and is called Skandaparāṇa in the ms, secured by Prof. Mankad, probably because the Purāṇa starts with a question by Skanda to Siva about the characteristics of the different yugas.. The characteristics of Kṛta, Treta and Dvāpara are regpactively described in lines 11-28, 29-45 and 46–74 of Prof. Mankad&rsquo;s text; and lines 75-235 (of Prof. Mankad&rsquo;s text) and lines 1-115 of Jayaswal&rsquo;s text ( in JBORS. vol. XIV. pp. 400-408) describe the characteristics of the Kaliyuga, and the political, social and economic history of a few centuries before the work was con posed. The characteristics of the Kaliyuga in the Yugapurang bear a very close resemblance to the description of Kaliyuga in the Vanaparva (chap. 188. 30-64), one half verse being the same in both 13c</p>
<p>The important points that emerge are briefly these: Ionit the discussion of different interpretations of Jayasval, Prof. Mankad and Prof. Narain. Kaliyuga started after Draupadi died. In the beginning of Kaliyuga Janamejaya, son of Packsit, would be a famous king but will come in conflict 13that with brāhmaṇas. In Kaliyuga, Udayi son of Siśudāga, vil found the city of Pataliputra on the south bank of the Ganges, which will come to be called Puspapira and which will last for five thousand, five hundred and five years, five months, five days and five muhurtas. In that Puspapara there will be a deluded and wicked king called sāliśāka who will establish at Saketa his virtuous elder brother named Vijaya Then the valiant Yavanas,</p>

<p>Pancalas and Mathuras will attack Sāketa and will conquer Kusumapura which had a mud fortification. All countries will be disturbed (by this onslaught of the Yavanas). Then non Aryans will follow the practices of the Aryas. At the end of Kali age brāhmaṇas, ksatriyas, vaiśyas will dress alike and have the same practices. People will join heretical sects and will make friends for ( seducing their ) vives. Sūdras will offer oblations into fire with the syllable &lsquo;om&rsquo; and they will address (Others) with the word &lsquo;bhoh&rsquo; and brāhmaṇas will address otherg with the words &ldquo;O aryas'. The Yavanas will establish five kings in the city (of Puṣpapura). The Yavanas will not stay long in Madhyadeśa. When the Yavanas will vanish there will be Boven powerful kings at Sākota; in Madhyadeśa there would be bloody wars. All the Āgniveśya kings will perish by war and 80 will the people.</p>
<p>Thereafter the greedy Saka king will undergo destruction against Sata, the king of Kalinga, and the earth will be devast ated and Puspapura will be a wilderness. Amlāta called &lsquo;red. eyed&rsquo; will secure Puṣpapura. The Mleccha king Amlāta will destroy the helpless people and the four varṇas. Amlāta with his relatives will perish and then there will be a king called Gopala who will rule one year and then die. There will then be the just king called Pusyaka who will rule only one year. After two more kings, Agnimitra will be king who will wage a terrible battle with brāhmapas for a girl. After him his son will rule for 20 years. The condition of the people will be very bad because of his fight with Sabarag. Then Sātu king will rule. Then there will be depredations of Sakas who will destroy One-fourth of the population and make the people demoralised, In this way the Yugapurāpa ends on a dismal note.1348 e</p>
<p>As the Purana stops with the Sakas and does not dilate on the dynasties of the Andhras, Abhiras and Guptas, it must be placed earlier than all the known Purāṇas which deal with these dynasties. Jayaswal places the Yugapurāṇa in the latter half of the first century B. C. In the opinion of the present author he is right.</p>

<p>A very recent work &ldquo;The Indo-Grooke' by Prof. A. K. Narain (Oxford, 1957) bas an illuminating note (pp. 174–179) on several difficult passages of the Yugapurana 1348. ;</p>
<p>Several Puranas such as Matsya 53.3-11, Vāyu 1.60-61, Brahmāṇda I 1.40-41, Liiga I. 2.2, Nāradiya I 92.22-26, Padma V. 1. 45-52 state that Purana 138 was originally only one, that Brahmā thought of it first, that after that the Vedas proceeded from Brahma&rsquo;s lips, that originally it had the extent of one hundred crores of ślokas and that the essence thereof to the e tent of four lakhs of verses was declared in each Dvāpara age by Vyāsa. It is impossible to say whether the writers of the entant Purāṇas had any ancient tradition about this before them a whether all this about the original existence of a single Parapa was purely imaginary. The author bolds that the latter vier</p>
<p>is more likely to be the correct one. It has been shown above that as early as the Taittiriya Ārapyaka Purānas are mentioned in the plural. Therefore, the extant Puranas are only the successors of the ancient Puranas, about which, it must be admitted, we know very little.</p>
<p>The number of Puranas (in later times and by some of the Puranas distinguished as Mabāpuradas) has been traditionally handed down as eighteen. They are enumarated in several Puranas, such as Vispu III. 6. 21-23, Varaha 112,69-72 ( Yerses 74-77 in Venk. ed.), Linga I. 39. 61-63, Mataya 53.11 , Padus IV. 100. 51-54, Bhavisya I L 61-64.

The Matsya (53. 18-19), Agni 272. 4-5, Nāradiya I. 92. 26-28 enumerate the Vayu as the 4th among the 18 Purānas, while most of the others substitute Sivapurāṇa as the 4th in place of the Vāyu. The Skanda (in Prabhāsakhapda 2.5 and 7) puts Saiva as the 4th in place of Vāyu and Vayaviya as the last (probably meaning Brahmānda thereby). The Devibhāgavata1352 contains a verso naming the 18 Purāpas by their first letters in which the Sivapurana is omitted. The Saurapurāṇa (chap. 9. 5-12) enumerates the 18 Purāpas, places Vāyu as the 4th (and not siya) and Brahmānda as the last. The Sūtasamhita (I 1. 7-11) games the 18 Purāṇas omitting Vāyu and putting Siva. purāṇa in its place. The Dānasāgara in its Introductory Verses (11-12 on pp. 2–3) mentions both Vāyaviya and Saiva separately, In the verses of the Kālikā-purāpā quoted by Hemādri on dāna 1. p. 531, Siva, Kālikā, Saura and Vabnija (Āgneya, the genuine one) are included among eighteen principal Purāṇas. On the whole I agree with Dr. A. D. Pusalkar 1353 that it is the Vāyu that is entitled to be regarded as one of the 18 principal Purāṇas and not the sivapurāṇa.

I p. 131, ed of 1888). It is clear, therefore, that the list of 18 principal Purāpas had boon completed long before 1000 A. D. and was introduced in the Viṣnupurāns many years before that date. Alberoni furnishes (ibid p. 130) another list of the names of 18 Puraṇas which he had heard, viz. Adi, Matsya, Kūrma, Varāba, Narasimha, Vāmana, Vāyu, Nanda, Skanda, Aditya, Soma, Samba, Brahmānda, Mārkandeya, Tārksys (ie. Garuda ), Viṣnu, Brahma, Bhavisy. It should be noticed that in this list Vāyu is included (and not Saiva), that some puranas described in other works as Upapurāṇas are included (viz. Adi, Narasimha, Nanda, Aditya, Soma and Samba) and some works almost on animously declared to be Mahāparāṇas ( such as Padma, Bhagan vata, Nārada, Agni, Linga and Brahmavaivarta ) are omitted, It follows that some upapurāṇas such as Adi, Narasimha, Aditya, Sāmba, Nanda (Nandi?) had been composed at least some time before 1000 A. D. Balambhatta (latter half of 18th century A. D.) states in his commentary on the Mitaksarā (on Yāj. 13) that the Vayaviya-purāna is also called Saiya.</p>

Similarly, the extent of the Kurms is said to be 17000 or 18000 slokas by most of the Purāṇas that furnish the extent of Puranas, but the extant Kurma has hardly 6000 slokas. The Brabma contains 10000 slokas according to the Nāradiya and 25000 socording to the Agni, but the printed Brahma (of the Anandisrama ed.) contains about 14000 verses. On the other hand, the Skanda (that has two recensions at present) is said to contain 81000 ślokas, but the Skanda &lsquo;printed by the Venk. Press contains several thousands more. The Bhavisya (Brahmaparva) is states that all Puranas had originally 12000 varses each, but their extent increased by the addition of tales, so that the Skanda was inflated to the extent of one lakh of ślakas and the Bhavisya to 50000 slokas. The order in which the Puranas are enumerated is not quite uniform. Most Purāṇas part the Brāhma in 1356 the first place and set out the order as in the table above, yet the Vayu (104.3) and the Devibhagarata (L3.3) begin the list of Purāpas with Matsya. The Skanda (Prabhasa khanda 2.8-9) puts the Brahmanda in the first place. The Bhagavata (XII. 7.23-24) enumerates the eighteen Puranas ia &amp; somewhat different order.

<p>History of Dharmasastra [sec. IV, On. XXII</p>
<p>Matsya as the foremost among Puranas.) Notices of the contents of all the 18 Puranas occur in Matsya ( chap. 53 ), Agni (chap. 272), Skanda (Prabhāsakhanda 2. 28-76), Nāradiya (which devotes 18 chapters from I 92. 30-43 to I. 109 to the contents of 18 Purānas from Brahma to Brahmānda ). There is almost complete agreement among the Purāpas as to the names of the 18 principal Purāṇas, except as to the Vāyupurāṇa.</p>
<p>The question about the Purāṇas is further complicated by the fact that some of the Purāpas themselves mention the names of a number of Upapurāṇas, though others ignore them. For example, the Matsya ( 53. 59-62 ) names the Narasimha, the Nandi, the Aditya and Samba as Upapurāṇas and appears to say that the Narasimha extended to 18000 ślokas and elaborated the description of the Man-Lion avatāra declared in the Padma purāṇa. The Kūrma (I. 1. 16-20 ), Padma (IV. 111. 95-98 ), the Devibhagavata (I. 3. 13-16) set out the names of eighteen Upapurāṇas. Some of the Upapurānas bear the same names as those of the principal purānas, viz. Skanda, Vāmana, Brahmānda and Nāradiya. Prof. Hazra 1358 states that the number of Upa purāṇas is 100. Only a few of the Upapurāṇas have been published and those published do not differ much in the matter of subjects from some of the principal purāṇas and almost all belie the definition of Purāṇa as pancalaksana&rsquo;. It has been seen above ( note 1349 ) that the number of slokas in the 18 principal Puranas is said to be four lakhs. It must be remem bered that this total does not include the number of the slokas assigned to the Upapurāṇas, and no Purāpa includes the perses of the Upapurāṇas in the total of four lakhs. Further, no one should forget or ignore the significance of the remarks of the</p>

The Kūrma is no less clear. It states that 1360 the Upapurānas are the summaries or abridgments of the 18 (principal) Puranas made by sages after studying them. The lists of Upapurānas given by several works, most of which are set out by Prof. Hasra in his paper on Upaparāgas (in ABORI vol. XXI at pp. 40-48) and in his Studies (pp. 4-13) diverge a good deal from each other. As the Matsya mentions by name only four Upapurāgas it is not unreasonable to hold that more than four were not in existence at the time when this passage of the Matsys was inserted in it or at least that more than four bad not been accepted as Upaparānas at that time. A good many of the Upapurāṇas are of late date. Only a few of the rest such as the Narasimha, the Viṣnu</p>

<p>History of Dharmaśāstra (Soc. IV, Oh. XXII dharmottara, the Dovl, can possibly be held to be as old as the 7th or 8th century A.D. I do not accept the view of Prof. Hazra, who places the period of the formation of the group of eighteen Upapurāṇas between 650-800 A.D. (in ABORI. vol. XXI at p.50 and also in&rsquo; Studies in Upapurāṇas &lsquo;vol. I. by Dr. Hazra ), where while admitting (p. 14 ) that in the Upapurāpa litarature there are works of comparatively late dates, be boldly states that the age of the Upapurāṇas began approximately from the Gupta period (p. 16). For this last statement there is absolutely no evidence whatever. A detailed discussion of the dates of all the Upapurāṇas would demand a large space and would be some what irrelevant in this section. We must hold fast by the facts that even when the 18 principal purānas assumed their present form, the number of Upapurāpas was small, that they were looked upon as no more than abridgments or sum maries of the principal Purānas, that the Puranas that mention upapurāpas do not state that they were composed by the divinely inspired Vyāsa (but only by some bages as the Kūrma says) and that originally they had not the status or authority of the 18 purānas. The Saura, an Upapurāṇa itself, speaks of Upapu rānas as kchilas (9.5). It is only the late medieval digesta like the Smrtitattva (1520–1570 A. D.) or the Viramitrodaya (first half of 17th century) that were separated by several centuries from the Mahapurāṇas as well as the Upapurānas and the writers of which had practically lost all sense of the distance in time between the two sets of Puriṇas, that say that the mention of Puriṇas 1361 as a source of dharma in Yāj. must be deemed to include Upapurāṇas also. This last may be the opinion of such late writers as Mitramiśra, but no scholar is bound to accept it. It is doubtful whether by the word Purāna, Yāj. refers to the Mahāpurāṇas now extant and whether he knows that there were eighteen of them. If some Upapurāṇas glorify themselves as of equal authority with the Mahāpurāṇas, that is of a piece with what the principal Purāṇas state about themselves viz. that Brahmā first thought of the Purānes and then the Vedas issued from his lips. Modern scholars should discount all these attempts at self-glorification. Upapurāṇas are due to sages. Upapurāpas are distinguished from Purānas in several important respecta. Firstly, the 18 purāpas are attributed to the semi-divine Vyāsa; secondly, according to both Matsya and Kurma, they were summaries of the Purāṇas; thirdly, the slokas in the &lsquo;. 1361. एतान्युपपुराणानि पुराणेग्यो निर्गतानीति याज्ञवल्क्येन पुराणलेन समाधीतानि ।</p>
<p>ANT4** (of efter staa) p. 14,</p>
<p>Upapurāpas distinguished from Purīnas 837 Upapurśnas are not included in the 4 lakhs of verses of all the Purānas together; fourthly, early commentators and nibandha writers like the Mitakṣarā and the Kṛtyakalpataru either do not mention any of the Upapurānas or at the most only about half a dozen or so and that too rather sparingly; and lastly, as Prof. Hazra himself asserts (&ldquo;Studies&rsquo;, vol. I. p. 23) adherents of various seots such as Sāktas, Sauras, Pancarātras interpolated chapters in the Purāṇas of the established group and in some cases wrote new and independent works to propagate their own ideas and styled them Purāṇas.</p>
<p>Early commentaries and digests of Dharmağastra very rarely refer to any of the well-known Upapurānas. The Mita kṣarā, though it names the Brāhma (on Yāj. I3 and 45), quotes passages from the Matsya ( profusely ), Vispu (on Yāj. III 6), Skanda (on Yāj. III. 290), Bhavisya (on Yāj. III, 6), Mārkan deya (on Yaj. I. 236, 254, ILL. 19, 287, 289 ) and Brahmanda (on Yāj. III, 30), hardly refers, so far as I know, to any UpapurāṇaThe Kṛtyakalpataru of Lakṣmidhara (composed about 1110-1130 A. D.), twelve parts of which published in the G.O. 8 cover several thousand pages, profusely quotes many of the Mabāpurinas, and only six of the Upapurāṇas by name, viz. Adi (only twice on suddhi), Nandi (profusely only on dāna and niyatakālika), Aditya, Kālikā, Devi, Narasimha (all four profusely on several topics). Aparārka (first half of 12th century A, D.) who quotes profusely from Brahma, Brahmānda, Bhavisyat, Mārkandeya, Vāyu, Viṣṇu and Matsya quotes by name only the following Upapurānas and only sparingly viz. Adi, Aditya, Kalikā, Devi, Nandi, Nrsimha, Viṣnudharmottara ( seven times ), Viṣnurahasya ( once ), and Sivadharmottara (once ). / The Dānasāgara 1.62 (written in 1169) states Upa purānas have been promulgated, which clearly set out the procedure of gifts&rsquo; and it expressly mentions as Upapuriṇas dealing with gifts the Ādya (Adi or Brahma?), Aditya, Kālikā, Nandi, Narasimha, Markandeya, Viṣnudharmottara and Samba and remarks that the Viṣnurahasya and Sivarahasya are merely compilations (sangraharūpa). It is not necessary to refer to writers later than about 1170 A, D, in the matter of Upapurānasi</p>

<p>them naturally lead to the inference that these passages were added some time after all the eighteen Purāṇas segumed &amp; complete form. It is not possible to hold that all the main purāṇas were composed at the same time by one individual author or even by several contemporary writers. Besides, most of the editions of Puranas are based either on a single ms. or on a fow mss. collected at random and are not critically edited as is the case with the critical edition of the Mahabhārata published in Poona by the B.O.R. I. Many conclusions there. fore, drawn from the current printed editions of the Purāṇas or from msg. of the Puranas, must be regarded as merely tentative and as likely to turn out to be wrong. What Winternitz said in his History of Indian Literature (English translation, Calcutta, vol. I. p. 469) viz &lsquo;that the date of each section, day, sometimes of each single verse in the Mabābhārata must be determined separately applies with equal (or perhaps greater) force to the Purāṇas, perticularly when one wants to use the section or stanza for historical or comparative purposes.1363</p>
<p>It may be conceded that the Puranas and some of the avail. able Upapurāṇas also contain many ancient legends and tradi tions; but these have been so much tampered with and inflated by additions intended to bolster up particular forms of worship and particular tenets that great caution is required before one can recognize them as genuine and reliable representatives for ascertaining the general state of Indian society and beliefs in ancient and medieval times.</p>
<p>In the opinion of the present writer there is no positive objective evidence for placing any of the upapurāṇas except the Viṣnudbarmottara before the 8th or 9th century A. D. Even in the case of Purāṇas, there have been large interpolations such as verses about the 18 purāṇas, their number and contents. But they contain much ancient material and are far more reliable than most of the Upapurāṇas, having been quoted by writers from 8th and 9th centuries A, D. Or even earlier.</p>
<p>The Amarakosa 1364 defines Itihasa&rsquo; as &lsquo;what happoned in the past&rsquo; and &lsquo;Purana&rsquo; as &lsquo;what has five signs or characteristics&rsquo;. It is no doubt true that some purānas speak of Purāna as</p>

The Bhagavata 1366 states that ten topics are dealt with by Puriṇas and that some say that they are only five. The ten topics of the Bhagavata are garga, visarga ( dissolution or cred tion after destruction), vrtti (modes of subsistence, natural or prescribed for all men by śāstra), raksā (protection i. e, avatāras destroying those that hate the Vedas), antarani (i e, manya taras), vamsa, vamsyanucarita, sanstha (four kinds of laya), hetu (the cause of creation viz. the soul that is subject to avidya and collects karma), apasraya (the refuge of individual souls, viz. brahman). The Matsyapurāṇa also mentions other charac teristics of Puranas viz. in all Parāṇas the four goals of man (puruṣarthas) are described, also the consequences of doing what is opposed to dharma, division of Puriṇas into sāttrika, rājası, tāmasa, the sāttvika and rajasa purāpas respectively extolling the greatness of Hari and Brahmā, tāmasa Puranas extolling Agni and Siva, the mixed ones extolling the greatness of Sarasvati and pitrs. The questions addressed by Manu to Kesaya (in Matsya 2. 22-24) indicate the subjects that wonld be dealt with by that Purāpa viz. creation and dissolution, the ramsas,</p>

<p>manvantaras, vaidyacarita, the expanse of the world, rulos about danas, śrāddha, varnas and aśramas, ista and purta, establishment of images of gods, and everything else.</p>
<p>It is not quite clear why the Amarakośa seized upon the above mentioned five topics as characteristics of Purāpas Amarakośa 1367 cannot be placed later than the 5th century A. D. It is likely that before that time the number of Purāpas was not large, that they had not become very inflated, and that, as Itihāsa and Purāṇa were often lumped together as the 5th Veda in the Upaniṣads, they both bad certain matters in common. Itihasa did not probably deal with creation, dissolution and manvastaras, but contented itself with the dynasties of kings and with the deeds and legends about the heroes of the past. Rarely, Itihāsa (Mahābhārata) is called Purāṇa and some extant Purāṇas describe themselves as Itibāsa. For example, the Vāgu 1368 calls itself in the same context both itibāsa and purāṇa. The Brabmapurāna calls itself Puriṇa as well as ākhyāna (245, 27 and 30). The Mahābhārata 1369, though generally called itibāsa by itaelf (as in Adi 1. 19, 26, 54 ) or the best of itihāsas, still applies to itself the words. &lsquo;ākhyāna 1370 (as in Adi 2. 388 89), Kavya (Adi 2. 390), Kārṣpaveda (Ādi 1. 264) and Purana (Adi 1. 17). From this it appears that originally the line of demarcation between the two was rather thin. lo defining Purāpa as &lsquo;pañcalaksana&rsquo; the Amarakośa and some of the Purāṇas seized upon such topics as distinguished Purāṇas from Itihāsa and other branches of Sanskrit literature.

<p>What Purūnas contained in Apostamba&rsquo;s day 841 shown above that the Purana and Bhavisyatpurāṇa that existed before Āpastamba contained not only sarga and pratisarga but . also some smrti materials as well. From the definition given in the Purāṇas and the Amarakośa it does not at all follow that those five topics alone were the constituent parts of the very ancient Purānas, as Kirfel holds; 1371 What could be said at the most is that five were the distinctive topics that differentiated the Purāpa class of works from other branches of literature and probably cognate works called Itihasa or it may be that the five are generalized as an ideal for Puranas and that the very early representatives of this class (that existed before Ap. Dh. 8.) had not these five as characteristics.</p>
<p>The extant Puranas contain far more subjects than the five. Some Purānas barely touch these five and deal at great length with altogether different topics. Only a few of the extant Purāpas can be said to deal with all the five topics at some length. The five characteristic topics occupy less than three percent of the extent of the extant Mahāpurānas. Of all Purānas the extant Viṣṇu alone closely agrees with the definition of Purāṇa as &lsquo;pañoalaksaṇa,&rsquo; though it also contains &amp; good many other topics. On a modest calculation the four subjects of vrata, śrāddha, tirtha and dāpa cover at least one hundred thousand slokas in the extant eighteen main Puranas. Several of them have identical chapters on several topics (e. g. Matsya 572 and Padmaa, Vāyu and Brahminda contain long passages that agree verbatim with one another in many matters and details). It is probable, therefore, that the extant principal Purāṇas are partial and gradually inflated representatives of an earlier group of Puranas (not necessarily 18 in number) that</p>

<p>existed before Yājñavalkya. In the present state of our know ledge it is almost an insoluble problem to find out what these Purānas were or contained. The number 18 was probably due to the fact that the number is prominent in several connections as regards the Mahābhārata. The Bharata war was fought for 18 days, the total of the vast armies engaged in the conflict came to 18 akṣauhiṇss, the epic has 18 purvans, the Gita also has 18 chapters.1373</p>
<p>The Purānas may be classified into several categories, viz. (1) encyclopaedic like the Agni, Garuda and Nāradiya, (2) those mainly dealing with tirthas such as Padma, Skanda and Bhavisya, (3) sectarian, such as Linga, Vāmana, Mārkandeya, (4) Historical such as Vāyu and Brabmanda. The Vayu, Brahmānda, Matsya and Visnu are probably the oldest among extant Purāpas, though they too have received substantial additions from time to time.</p>
<p>There are seven Purānas that contain historical material, viz, the ancient dynasties down to the time of the Bhārata war and from the Bharata war to the downfall of the Andhras and the rise of the Guptas, 1974 viz. Vāyu 99. 250-435, Viṣnu IV. 20. 12 to IV. 24. 44, Brahmānda III, 74, 104-248, Bhagavata IX. 12. 9-16, IX. 22. 34-49 and XII. 17, Garuda 140 and 141. 1-12, Bhaviṣya III. 3 and 4 (this account is practically worthless). Matsya contains the fullest list of Āndhra kings and states (273. 16-17) that 29 Andhra kings will rule for 460 years, while the Vayu (99. 357-358) states that 30 Andhra kings will rulo 13746 for 456 ( 406?) yearg. Both Vayu (99. 355 ) and -Matsya (373. 16) (&lsquo;Pulovā&rsquo; in Vāyu) make Puloma as the last king of the Āndhras. Ptolemy who published his &lsquo;Geography of India&rsquo; about</p>

So that these bistorical references to Andhras must be a good deal later than 150 A.D. Only four Puranas vim. Vāyu, Brahmānda, Bhāgavata and Viṣnu mention in a general way that kings of the Gupta dynasty will rule along the Ganges up to Prayāga, Sākota ( Ayodhyā) and Magadha, but no games of Gupta kings are specified. The passages referring to the Guptas are rather corrupt.1374 It is argued by Pargiter ( in &lsquo;Dynastieg of the Kali age&rsquo; p. XII.) and others that Samudragupta was a great conqueror as his Allahabad Praśasti show! (Fleet&rsquo;s &lsquo;Gupta Inscriptions&rsquo; No. 1). Most scholars are agreed that the Gupta dynasty began to rule about 320 4. D. It is argued that, if the reviser or revisers of the Purāpas had knowo the brilliant campaigns of Samudragupta they would have named him at least and that therefore the revision of the Vayu took place between 320-335 A.

<p>Some remarks on the important conclusions of Pargitor and Kirfel are necessary, Pargiter tries to construct history from the earliest times to the Bhārata war which he holds to have taken place about 950 B. O. (AIHT, chap. 15 p. 182). He holds that there were two traditions in ancient India, viz. the Ksatriya tradition and the Brāhmaṇa tradition (AIHT, chap. 5 pp. 58-77). He harps dozens of times on the utter lack of the historio sense among the brāhmaṇas in his work (AIHT), holds that the Purāṇas represent the ksatriya tradition, that there were three racial stocks, viz. the Mānavas (or Māovas as he styles them), the Ailas and the Saudyumnas, that respectively represent the Dravidian, the Aryan and Munda (AIHT chap, 25 pp. 289–302), that the Puranas are Sanskritizations of works in Prakrit (pp. X-XI ) of &lsquo;Dynasties of the Kali age&rsquo;. His date for the Mahābhārata war has not been accepted by later scholars, since his handling of that subject is not judioial, objective or straightforward, but relies too much on his own prejudices and on averages. In his &lsquo;Purana texts of the dynasties of the Kali age (pp. 58, 74) he appears to favour the view that the Bhārata war was fought 1050 years before the Nandas i. e, about 1475 B.C. The mss. and the printed Parānas give four different periods between the birth of Pariksit 1376 and</p>

Pargiter himself argues forcefully for the trustworthiness of tradition and Paurānika genealogies in R.G. Bhandarkar Presentation volume pp. 107–113 and in AIHT chap. X. p. 119–125. Besides, there is the com mon experience that the total number of years between one well known event and another can be easily remembered and handed down even orally for hundreds of years, while handing down hundreds of royal names is a difficult matter and some names may easily drop out. Moreover, the Matsya, Brahmāpda and Vāyu themselves say that they 1377 mention only the prominent kings of the Ikṣvāku line and the Bșhadratha line 1378 and even as to the Paurava 1379 line it is clear that that dynasty had many names not all of which are enumerated. There is therefore every possibility that some kings dropped out even in later genealogies also (as for example Matsya 213. 16, saying that Andhras were 29 and Vāgu 99.357 saying they were 30 ). Merely counting the total of the kings actually named in the Purāṇas would not convoy a quite accurate idea of the total length of years during which that dynasty ruled. Bearing in mind the two matters (viz, trustworthiness of tradition and Paurānika genealogies and the ease of remembering the time distance between too well-known events) he ehould have endeavoured to find out the age of the Bharata War. He brushes aside the statement of the period between Parikṣit and Nanda 28 unreli</p>
<p>(Continued from last page) states that in the 9th Skandha the Bhagavata assigas 1000 years to 20 kings from Mārjāri of the Māgad ba lide (a contemporary of Pariksit), then 5 Pradyotapa kings ruled for 138 years, then the siśunāgas ruled for 360 years; thus 1498 years passed between Parikṣit and the crowning of Nanda and therefore he supports the readiog of the interval as 1500 years.</p>

<p>Pargiter&rsquo;s methoi criticized</p>

<p>able simply on the ground (which appears to me flimsy ) that the figures (1015, 1050) are discrepant (A. LH. T. p. 180). In almost all passages of the Purānas there is some discrepancy or other. Therefore, he should have made an endeavour to find out which one of the three perioda (1015, 1050, 1500 ) is supported by the best and oldest mss, and should have stuck to them, part cularly when the Sanskrit equivalents of the three periods (pañcadaśa, pancūśat and pañcasata) are so much alike that scribes might easily have been confused and made their own readings. Even taking the least period of (1015) years, the Mahābhārata War would have to be placed at about 1440 B. C. (adding 1015 to the date of Nanda&rsquo;s enthronement, vize about 425 B. C.). Most Western writers and Prof. S. N. Pradhan (in &lsquo;Chronology of ancient India&rsquo;, Caloutta 1927, pp. 2497) find fault with Paurāṇika statements and brush them aside as practically worthless. Prof. Pradhan takes the kings actually named in the three lines, holds that 28 years are the average reign period of each and multiplying the number of kings by 28 arrives at the conclusion that the Mahābhārata war was fought about 1150 B.O. It is not possible to deal at length with his arguments. But he ignores the express words of the Purāṇas that they em merate only the principal or important kings. Besides, there are scholars like Pargiter who regard 17 or 18 years as the average reign of a king in other countries (and in India also). The author cannot accept Prof. Pradhan&rsquo;s reasoning. Most Western writers are loth to assign old dates to matters Indian. Pargiter is no exception. Instead of straightforwardly accepting one of the three periods that was strongly supported by mss, he in dulges in some devices that appear like trioks of jugglery (A. I. H. T. pp. 180-183). His method requires some explanation and examination.</p>
<p>Vyāsa is said to have been alive when the Bhārata battle was fought at the end of the Dvāpara age and he is also hold to be the author of the 18 Purāpas. The kings before the Bhārata war, the Pandava heroes and a fow descendants of them and of some contemporaries of them are treated by the Matsya, Vāyu, Brahmānda and others as past (atila).

<p>(excluding Arjuna) is said to have been alive when the Puriṇas were narrated to the sages at the sattra. Both Vāyu (99. 282) and Matsya (271.5) state that in the Ikṣvāku line king Divakara, 6th (or 5th in Matsya) in descent from Brhadbala, was alive at the time when the Purānas were narrated. Then the same Purānas (Vāyu 99.30, Matsya 271. 23 and Brahmānda III. 74. 113) state that in the line of Jarāgandha (ruler of Magadha ), who was a contemporary of the Pāṇdavas and whose son Sahadeva was killed in the Bhārata war, there was Senājit who was a contemporary of Adhisima-krspa and Divākara and who was 7th in descent from Sahadeva. These three are desoribed as vartamāna kings in the Purāpas and all those that came after these three are described ag bhavisya. Pargiter first (AIHT p. 180) takes the total of the kings of the three dynasties, Aikṣvāka, Paurava and Māgadha that are actually named (ignoring what the Purānas say viz. that only the principal or important kings are named and not all) and the total of the re igns of all these (1408 years), finds that the average of the reign of each king in the three lines works out at such large figures as 47, 50, 31, which he regards as impossible when tested by real historical averages. But he forgets that the Purāṇas say that in the Aikṣvāka, Magadha and Peurava lines and also generally only the prominent kings are mentioned and also that the extant Purāṇas are only fragments left of the originals, since in the Brahmānda (III. 74) all Paurava and Aikṣvāka kings are altogether lost. Then he takes the total number of kings in ten kingdoms up to Mahāpadma and arrives at the average of 26 kings for each kingdom (AIHT p. 181). Then he says that the average of fourteen series of kings in Eastern and Western countries which he examined comes to 19 years for each reign and, holding that the average in eastern countries is less than in western countries, he arrives at the average of 18 years for each reign (pp. 181–182), which he regards as fair and rather liberal. He then multiplies the average 18 (of length of reigns ) by 26 (the average number of kings in ten countries which he supposes to be the only kings in those ten) and arrives at the figure 468 years. He adds these to the date whioh be assigns to Mahāpadma Nanda 38% B. C. and thus arrives at 850 B. O. as the mean date of the beginning of the reign of Adhisimakrsna, Divakara and Sepājīt, who were vartamāna kings. Then he takes five as the average of the kings between the vartamāna kings and Yudhiṣthira and assigning about 100 years to those 5 kings, arrives at the date 950 B, O, for the Bbārata war. HoFargiter and the Bhārata war</p>
<p>849</p>
<p>disoards (AIHT p. 180 n 3) the astronomical evidence contained in the Purāṇas (and the Mahābhārata) about Bharata war in a single sentence viz, that astronomical statements can have no scientific precision and can only have been formed by estimate at the close. The probable date of the Mahābhārata war has been discussed by the author at some length on materials supplied by the Mahābbārata, the Purānas, Varahamihira, Āryabbata and Inscriptions in vol. II, pp. 895-923 and there fore he does not go into that question here. But he strongly disapproves of the methods of Pargiter and the date he deduces. Later scholars like Kirfel have not accepted the conclusions of Pargiter about two separate traditions and about the Purānas being Sanskritizations of originals written in Prakrit and Kharoṣthi script (p. XVI. of Intro. to &lsquo;Purāṇa Texta &amp;c.). The importance of another independent source has not been taken proper notice of by Pargiter and even by Kirfel. It appears that about 300 B.C. Megasthenes was supplied with a list of kings from Bacchus to Alexander&rsquo;s tima (153 or 154 in gumber) covering by their reigns a period of 6451 years and three months. Vide &lsquo;Ancient India as described by Megasthenes and Arrian&rsquo; by McCrindle (1877) p. 115 and Cambridge History of Ancient India, Vol. I (1922, p. 409). Even supposing for argument that the account of kings is not trustworthy the fact remains that about 300 B. C. Indians claimed that they had lists of kings that reigned before that date for thousands of years (and not for a few hundred years as Pargiter would have us believe ).</p>
<p>It has been shown above that Apastamba mentions a Bhavi syatpurāna and quotes four verses from a Purana (p. 817, note 1328). That Bhavisyat-purana was probably so called because it contained in a prophetic voin the names and other details of kings that flourished after the Bhārata heroes and after a fow generations of descendants of them and their contemporaries and probably purported to have been composed by some sage or by Vyāba. As the Kali age is said to have started after the Bhārata war, as Parāśara, his son Vyāsa and Vyāsa&rsquo;s son Suka were regarded as more or less contemporaries of the Pāpdayas that lived in the Dvāpara age and as all the 18 Purāpas are deemed to have been composed by Vyāsa 1381 in the Dvāpara age, the history of the kings of the Kali age from the descendants</p>

It has not been clearly noticed by both Pargiter and Kirfel that the so-called future kings are divided into two groups, viz. the kings of the Aila, Aikṣvāka and Magadha lines from Adhisimakrsna, Divakara and Senājit to the last scions of these lines ( such 1382 as Sumitra in the Aikṣvāka line, Ksemaka in the Aila line) form one group and later kings in the lines of Pradyotas, Sungas, Andhras, Sakas and others form another group and further that the first group was most probably dealt with in the ancient Bhavisya-purāṇa or some other Purāpa if we rely on Āpastamba, but the other group not having been in existence when the Bhavisyat was composed (before 500-400 B.C.) was dealt with by the extant Puranas from information received by them apart from the ancient Bhavisyat, This is clear from the passages of the Matsya and Vāyu quoted 1383 below. The Matsya says &lsquo;After this I shall proclaim thoge future kings in the Aida (Aila), Aikṣvāka and Paurava lines and those with whom those three benign (or virtuous) families will come to an end and I shall enumerate all of these kings that are narrated in the Bhavisya.

Vide quatre attrarre TASTY 97.V.3 117, from which it appears that Parsu was an आयुधजीविसह like यौधेय in the times of Pāgini. Parkas were ancient Persians, as appears from the Bebastan Inscription of Darius (522-486 B.C.). Vide &lsquo;Select Inscriptions&rsquo; vol. I. pp. 1-6 ed. by Dr. D.C. Sircar where Pars occurs as the name of a country. The other sepse given above does not suit the context.

<p>Ksatriya class), Parasayas (the Parsi tribe or parsons born of a śūdra father and brāhmaṇa mother?), Sūdras (as kings) and others that are foreigners, the Andhrae, Sakas, Pulindas, Calikas, Yavadas, fishermen, Abhiras and Sabaras and others born of Mleccba (tribes these kings I shall proclaim one after another in order and by name. Out of these (two groups) the first is Adhisimakrṣpa who is now alive and I shall speak of the kings of his line that are narrated in the Bhavisya&rsquo;. This passage makes it perfectly clear that in the ancient Bhaviṣyat kings of the three lines of Aila, Aikṣvāka and Paurava to the last of them were enumerated (vide note 1382), but that the later kings like the Andbrag and Sakas were not enumerated therein. I agree with Pargiter (p. VIII. in Intro. to &lsquo;Purāpa Toxta&rsquo; &amp;c.) that the words &lsquo;Bhavisye kathitān&rsquo; in Matsya (50.77) or &lsquo;Bhavisye pathitān&rsquo; in Vāyu (in 99.292) rṛfer to the descendants mentioned in the Bhavisya and that they do not simply mean &lsquo;mentioned in future.&rdquo; I fail to understand, however, why be regards &lsquo;Bhavisyat&rsquo; as a perversion of &lsquo;Bhavisya&rsquo;. Bhavisyat is as good a word as Bhavisya, being employed in several passages such as Varāba ( 177, 34 ), Matsya ( 53. 62).</p>
<p>Pargiter probably wants to identify the Bhavisyat of Apa stamba with the Bhavisya of later times. There is no evidence except the name to identify the two. It, therefore, appears that the extant Puriṇas base their narrative as to the three lines of Aila, Aikṣvāka and Paurava kings on the materials contained in the ancient Bhavisya and as to other lines and compara tively later kings they relied on other materials or oral traditions that they could collect. This inference receives support from other circumstances. The extant Purānas quote versos called Anuyamsa slokas or gathas about ancient kings, such as Kārta virya (in Vāyu 94. 20, Matsya 43, 24, Brahmānda III. 68-20, Brahma 13.17) and also about the last scions of the Alla and Aiksvāka lines, viz. Sumitra and Ksemaka. But so far as kings of comparatively later dynasties such as those of the Andbras, Sungas and others are concerned, no such gāthās or slokas are quoted in the Purānas. There is absolutely no evidence to hold, as Pargiter doas (p. XIII of Purāna Texts&rsquo; &amp;o.), that the ancient Bhavisya contained &amp; reference to the Guptas. The ancient Bhavisya was composed before Āpastamba (ie, before the 4th or 5th B.O.) and hence originally could have contained no reference to the Guptas (whose rule began about 320 A. D.). The Matsya does not refer to the Guptas and mentions only the</p>
<p>852</p>
<p>History of Dharmajāstra (Soc. IV, Oh XXII</p>
<p>downfall of the Andhras. Therefore, the Matsya should be regard ed as composed or revised about the middle (or end) of the Srd century A. D., though the possibilities of some chapters or versos being added after that date cannot be ruled out. When the Vayu (99. 383), Brahmānda (III. 74. 195), Viṣnu (IV. 24. 18) and Bhagavata (XII. 1. 37) mentioned the Guptas as rulers the first two probably added these passages just about the time when Gupta rule began and the Viṣnu and Bhāgavata (which present a corrupt text) might bave borrowed the information from mss. of Vāyu or Brahmānda. It is clear, however, that the first two (out of the four) Puriṇas were composed or revised about 320-335 A. D. and the other two later still.</p>
<p>Kirfel&rsquo;s work ‘Purāna Pancalaksana&rsquo; is one of fundamental importance so far as the Purāṇas are concerned, since it adopts &amp; new method for the treatment of Paurāṇika material. The German Introduction of this work has been reproduced in English in the Journal of the Shri Venkatesa Institute at Tirupati, in yol. VII, pp. 81–121 and vol VIII. pp. 9-33. Kirfel disagrees with many of the views of Pargiter. His main con clusions are: Apart from the abridgemont in Agni and Garuda as well as the prose paraphrase in Viṣnu, there are only three completo groups of Purāpa texts viz. Brahma and Harivamsa, Brahmaṇda and Vāyu, and that of Matsya, all other Purānas containing only smaller or larger parts of the same. Of the three groups, Brahmānda and Hariyamsa are the oldest ( and not Brah māpda and Vayu as Pargiter in A.I.H.T. p. 78 says). Kirfel holds that the Brahmānda and Vayu must have originally been a single Purāṇa, particularly because the largest parts of both agree with each other, that Pargiter is not right in thinking that the additions in Vāyu and Brahmānda were borrowed from the ancient Bhavisya (Kirfel p. 18, vol. VII. of J. V. O. I. p. 92), but that the borrowed material goes back to an independent text. Kirfel does not accept Pargiter&rsquo;s theory that the Purāṇas were Sanskritizations of Prakrit texts, that the Viṣṇu in its existing form is a younger Purāṇa than the Vāyu or Brabrānda in spite of the fact that it most faithfully observes the basic arrangement of the five characteristics of Purāṇas. The division of Purānas into 18 and the distribution of Purāṇas into sāttvika, rājasa and tāmasa are not original items but are applicable only to the last definitive texts of the Purāṇas. Pargiter thought that there existed an Ur-Purāpa which had treated of the five topios (of sarga &amp;c.) in ideal completeness and clear disposition Kirfel</p>
<p>Kirfel and Pargiter</p>
<p>859</p>
<p>says that this is soarooly more than an arbitrary assumption (p. XL VIII of Kirfel&rsquo;s Intro. and J. V.O. I. vol. VIII, p. 31).</p>
<p>The present author may tentatively accept most of the con clusions of Kirfel, but he differs, as stated above from Kirfel&rsquo;s view that the five characteristic topics ( sarga &amp;c.) are the oldest constituent parts of the whole Purāṇa Literature.</p>
<p>A lengthy discussion of the age of the Purāpas is not very relevant to the subject of this section. But it would not be entirely out of place if the author said a few words thereon.</p>
<p>The author&rsquo;s position about the Purāṇas is as follows: We know hardly anything about the Purāṇa mentioned in Atharva veda, the Satapatha and the ancient Upaniṣads; but this much is clear that Purana had attained a status of sacredness like the Vedas and was closely associated with Itihāsa even in Vedic times. This is the first stage in the evolution of Purāna Literg ture, but we know nothing about the contents of the Purāṇa in those ancient times. The Tai. Ā, mentions Purānāni, therefore in its time there must have been three Purāṇas at least. As Āp. Dh. 8. quotes four verses from a Purāṇa and expressly names Bhavisyatpurāṇa, it follows that by the 5th or 4th century B. C. at the latest, there was in existence a Bhavisyat-purana and other Purāṇas or a Purāṇa, that contained sarga and pratisarga and some Smrti material. This we may regard as the 2nd definite stage of Purana Literature, of the contents of which we have some traces at least.</p>
<p>The Mahābhārata quotes hundreds of versos (called slokas, gathas, anuvainsa ślokas), some of which have a bearing upon Paurāṇika subjects and have a Paurāṇika ring. Some examples may be cited. The Vanaparva 1384 quotes two verses about the spiritual prowess of Viśvāmitra and about his assertion that he was a brāhmaṇa. The Anuśāsanaparva 138 quotes certain</p>

<p>gātbūs said to have been sung by the pit[8 about the importance of a son or sons, which agree in letter and spirit with Verses on the same subject in the Puranas. In the Udyoga-parva 1386 Bhisma is said to have addressed a verse to Paraśurāma that was sung by Marutta and declared in a Purāṇa. In the Purānas also there are frequent quotations of ślokas,1387 gāthās and anuvamśaślokas sung by people described as Paurānika (in Vayu 70, 76, 88. 114-116, 88. 168-169, Brahmāṇda III. 63. 69-70) or as purūvdah or purānajñāḥ in Vāyu, 83. 171 and 95. 19, Brahmāṇda III. 63. 171). Vāyu (93. 94-101) mentions several gāthās as sung by Yayāti, most of which occur in the Adiparva 75. 50-53 and 85. 12–15, Brahmānda III. 68.96&ndash;103 and in other purāṇas also. It is quite possible that these gāthās and slokas said to have been declared by those who knew Purāṇas were taken from the Purāṇa or Purānas known to Āpastamba. As Yaj. I, 3 regards Purāna as one of the sources of dharma, it follows that some Purāpas containing smsti material must have been composed a good deal before that smṛti i. e. before the 2nd or 3rd century A. D. at the latest. This is the third stage in the evolution of Purāṇas. It is difficult to say when the extant Matsya was originally composed but it was revised about the middle (or close ) of the 3rd century A D., since it speaks of the downfall of the Andhra dynasty, but does not refer to the Guptas. But it is possible that the original kernel of the Matsya may be earlier than this by a few centuries. The same applies to Vāyu and Brabmānda. The Vayu and Brahmāṇda also were compiled or added to about 320-335 A. D., since they refer to the Guptas but do not name any Gupta king. These two in their present form may also be referred to this third stage. Most of the Maha purāṇas were composed or completed in the period from the 5th</p>

<p>or 6th century A. D. to the 9th century A. D. This represents the 4th stage in the evolution of Purāṇa literature. The Upe purāṇas began to be compiled from about the 7th or 8th century A. D. and their numbers went on increasing till about the 13th century A. D. or even later. This is the last phase. Thus there is enough evidence to hold that the Purāṇas began to influence Hindu society a few centuries before Christ, that their influence continued in full force till the 17th or 18th century A. D. and that it continues to some extent oven now. After the 9th century no further Mahāpurāṇas appear, but additional matter appears to have been unscrupulously inserted in several Purāṇas, the worst example of the kind being the third part of the Bhavisya, which contains stories of Adam and Eve, of Pithviraj and Jaicandra, Taimur, Akbar, Caitanya, Bhattoji, Nadirshah and so on.</p>
<p>The word &lsquo;purāpa&rsquo; occurs over a dozen times in the Rgveda, is an adjective and means &lsquo;ancient, old&rsquo;. The Nigbantu (III. 27) mentions six Vedic words as having the sense of &lsquo;purāpa&rsquo; viz. pratnam, pradivaḥ, pravayāḥ, sanemi, pūrvyan, ahnāya. Yaska (Nirukta III, 19) derives the word &lsquo;purana&rsquo; as &lsquo;purā navam bbavati&rsquo; (what was now in former times ). The Rgveda does not contain the word &lsquo;purātana&rsquo; (ancient). Purāṇa may be a very old form of purātana&rsquo; through the intermediate form &lsquo;purāapa.&rsquo; From meaning ancient the word &lsquo;purāṇa&rsquo;came to mean a work dealing with ancient tales; it became a noun and was applied in the times of the Atharvaveda, the Satapatha and the Upaniṣads to a class of works containing ancient tales. When purāṇa came to mean a work dealing with ancient tales, to speak of a Bhavisyat-purāṇa was apparently a contradiction in terms. That contradiction was probably not minded or was ignored by the thought that works that narrated old tales gradually came to inolude comparatively rocont ones and bad therefore to adopt &amp; prophetic style of composition with reference to the latter.</p>
<p>The Vāyu 1388 derives the word &lsquo;Purāṇa&rsquo; from &lsquo;purā&rsquo; (in ancient times, formerly) and the root &lsquo;an&rsquo; (to breathe or live), and therefore according to it the word literally means that which lives in the past&rsquo; or that which breathes ancient times&rsquo;,</p>

<p>The Padmapurāṇa propounds &amp; slightly different etymology, viz.&rdquo; it is called Purāna because it desires or likes the past&rdquo; from &lsquo;purā&rsquo; and the root vas&rsquo; ( to desire or to like).</p>
<p>The question why the extant Purānas do not narrate the traditions about the dynasties of the Guptas and their successors cannot be satisfactorily answered. One reason may be that the original kernel of some Purāṇas like the extant Matsya were compiled before the Guptas rose to power, while others like the Vāyu and Brahmānda were compiled while the Gupta rule was in its infancy. Another reason may have been that in the 5th and following centuries when many of the extant Purāṇas were compiled northern India was very much disturbed by the invasions of foreigners like the Hūnas, 1389 Toramāna and Mihirakula, numerous sects and schisms had arisen, Buddhism had become powerful and therefore the first task of the intelligent and devout followers of the Vada was held to be to wean the common people away from schisms like that of Buddha, to lay down the foundations of a new ideology among the masses and to emphasize and assimilate as many of the doctrines of the sects and schisms as possible with their ancient traditions and practices. The intelligent classes, therefore, emphasized the importance of such virtues as ahimsā, satya, bhakti and of vratas, pilgrimages, śrāddhas and dānas and were probably not in a mood to record the names of foreign conquerors or of small chieftains fighting with each other and unable to repel the cruel invaders. For the absence of references to the dynasties of the Guptas and their successors, Pargiter blames the brāhmaṇas in the following characteristic passage (AIHT chap. 4 p. 57) &lsquo;the absolute dearth of traditional history after that stage is quite intelligible, both because the compilation of the Purana had set a goal of tradition and because the Purana soon passed into the hands of brāhmanas who preserved what they had received, but with the brahmanio lack of the historio sense, added nothing about the later kings&rsquo;. Supposing for argument that brāhmaṇas lacked the historic sense, Pargitor&rsquo;s opinion appears to be entirely one-sided. He assigns no reason why the gūtas, whose business was to record and preserve historic tradition ( as he himself says on p. 58 of AIHT), did not stick to their business and did not continue to compose gonealogios of</p>

It is probable that foreign dynas ties like that of Kaniṣka and the Hūṇas did not encourage the gūtas who had sunk low in the social scale and the sūtas probably became Buddhists, &amp;e Buddhism with its Jātaka stories gave to all persons following a bardic profession sufficient scopo for earning their livelihood.</p>
<p>The legends about Vyāsa and Sūta may be briefly considered. The Purāṇas declare that Vyāsa was the son of Parāśara, was also called Kșspa Dvaipāyana and was an incarnation of Viṣnu ( of Brahmā also in Vayu 77. 74–75 and of Siva in the Kurma II. 11. 136). He was called Draipāyana 1390 because he was born on an island (dvipa) in the Yamunā river and Krsna be cause he was of dark complexion. His mother was Satyavati and son was Suka. He was called Vyāsa because he is supposed to have divided or arranged the one Veda into four parts (from the root &lsquo;as&rsquo; 4th conjugation to throw' with the upagarga &lsquo;vi&rsquo;). He instructed four disciples in the four Vedas, viz. Paila, Vaiśampāyana, Jaimini and Sumantu respectively in Rgveda, Yajurveda, Sāmaveda and Atharyaveda. His 5th disciple was Sūta Romaharṣaṇa to whom was imparted Itihasa-Purāṇa. The son of Būta was Sauti who narrated the Mahābhārata to Śaunaka and other gages in the Naimiṇa forest. It was believed that whenever dharma and Veda declined Vyāsas were born for the benefit of men (Brahma 158. 34). The Kūrma (I. 52. 1-9 ) sets out 27 names of different Vyāsas, while Vāyu (23. 115-219), Brahmānda (IL. 35. 116-125 ), Viṣṇu 1391 (III. 3. 11-19)</p>

<p>enumerate the names of the 28 Vyasas of the 28 Dvāpara ages of the Vaivasvata Manvantara (which is the ourront one). How Vyāsa put together the Purapas is described in several Puranas * He who was an adept in the meaning of Purāpa composed &amp; Purāpa-samhita from ( the material supplied by ) tales, episodes, gāthās ( stanzas) and correct ascertainment or descriptions of Kalpas &lsquo;. 1392 This shows that, while the Vedic texts were pres. erved with unparalleled care by the brāhamaṇas, the very ancient Itihāga-purāṇa, though called the 5th Veda, was not kept intact with care similar to that bestowed on the four Vedas and that this fifth Voda was allowed to be inflated by fresh addi tions from time to time,</p>
<p>In connection with Vyāsa&rsquo;s legendary role as an arranger of the Veda, Pargiter has a theory of his own which must be briefly noticed and examined. He develops that theory on pp. 9-10 of A. I, H. T. Ho refers to the Rgveda as the greatest brahmanical book, says that it is a compilation of hymns com posed by many authors and is arranged according to certain principles. His words are * It (Rgveda ) niust manifestly have been compiled and arranged by some one or more persons, yot Vedic Literature says absolutely nothing about this. The brāhmaṇas cannot have been ignorant about it, for they pros erved it and its text with unparalleled care. **Vedic Literature professes to know and declares the names of the authors of near ly all the hymns and even of single verses, yet it ignores all knowledge of the person or persons who afterwards compiled and arranged these hymns. To suppose that when it preserved the earlier information it was ignorant of the later work in so vital a matter is ridiculous.&rsquo; From this silence in the Vedic Litera ture about the persons that compiled and arranged the Rgveda, Pargiter at once jumps to the positive and emphatio conclusion, as is usual with many western writers on Sanskrit Literature and Indology to argue from silence, that Vedic Literature has deliberately suppressed all information on these matters' (AIHT p. 9). He refers to the fact that the Mahābhārata and Purāṇas are full of Vyāsa and repeatedly declare that the Veda was arranged by Vyasa and points out that Vedic Literature is</p>

<p>remarkably ratioent about Vyasa Pārāsarya (who is mentioned as &amp; pupil of Viṣvaksena in the Vamga list at the end of the Sāmavidhana Brahmaṇa and in the Taittiriya Aranyaka) and then he reiterates his charge of the conspirary of silence about Vyāsa ( AIHT. p. 10). Pargiter is ready with a reason for the supposed conspiracy of silence viz. the brāhmaṇas put forward the doctrine that the Veda existed from everlasting; hence to admit that any one had compiled or even arranged it struck at the root of their doctrine and was in common parlance to give their whole 0880 away&rsquo; (ibid. p. 10).</p>
<p>Several objections can be raised against the positive asser tion of deliberate and fraudulent suppression inferred from more silence. In the first place, Pargitor is very loose in his statement of facts. Pargiter totally ignores that even in the Rgveda itself, Țk verses, yajus texts and sāman chants are differentiated. To give only a few references, vide for Rka (Rg. II. 35. 12, V. 6.5, V. 27. 4, V. 44. 14-15), in both verses of the last rk and smans being separately mentioned; for yajus vide Rg. V.62.5, X. 181.3); for saman chants vide Rg. II, 43.2 (udgāteva sakune sāna gāyasi), VII, 81, 5 ( Śravat sāma giyamānam), VII. 95. 7 (suddhena sāmnā).</p>
<p>The epic and purānic texts indicate that Voda was thought to be originally one, but was arranged into four groups, that the four groups of texts were entrusted for preservation and propagation to four different disciples of Vyāsa. The Rgveda has two arrangements, one into mandalas and sūktas and the other into aṣtakas, adhyāyas and vargas. The Taittirlyasamhita and Atharvaveda are arranged into kāṇdas. Not a word is said in any of these accounts to which Pargiter refers about pioking up hymns already existing or their being arranged in mandalas ar adhyāyas or kāṇdas by Vyasa. Further, the reason assigned for the supposed deliberato suppression of the name of the arranger of the Veda is quite flimsy, not to say ridiculous. Every hymn of the Rgveda or every mantra has &amp; qṣi who by the ancient Indian tradition was not the author (as Pargiter puts it) but only the seer. It is clear from Brāhmaṇa texts, Upaniṣads and smrtis that from very 1393 anoient times it was a very strict principle</p>

<p>History of Dharmatāstra (Soo. IV, Ch. XXtt</p>
<p>that no one should teach or repeat in japa or employ &amp; mantra in a sacrifice without knowing the rṣi, the metre, the deity and the Use (viniyoga) of it and dire consequences were declared to follow for him who was remiss in these matters. Hymns and mantras were arranged in different groups for different religi ous rites and solemn sacrifices or for other purposes (such as śāntis). It is not necessary to remember who arranged the required mantras for rites, sacrifices and other purposes. The Brāhmaṇa texts and srauta sūtras prescribe the manner of the employment of the same mantras for various purposes and the Anukramaṇis contain the names of the seors, metres and the deities of hymns and individual mantras also. As every mantra of the Veda was supposed to be only seen by a sage and as eternal, the more compilation of them in one or more series of the more arrangement of mantras or hymns in different groups for different purposes did not at all affect or interfere with the eternality of mantras or hymns. Pargiter&rsquo;s 80-called reason for suppressing the name of the arranger of the Veda is simply do reason at all.</p>
<p>Pargiter did not stop to consider possible explanations. One of the most plausible is now put forth. The Mahābhārata and the Purapas (a very extensive literature) were attributed to Vyāsa, who, as shown above in n. 1390, had come to be looked upon as Viapu or as an avatāra of Vispu. The four Vedas and the Beveral different śākhās (recensions) of each Veda were well known, By a sort of post facto explanation, the distribution of the Veda into four main groups was claimed to have been brought about by the divinely inspired Vyāsa, whose Puranas are, as will be apparent from note 1349 above and as will be shown in more detail later, glorified as even anterior and superior to the Veda. The eternality of the Veda had to be maintained and at the same time Vyāsa was to be glorified.</p>

<p>How Vyasa was proclaimed as Veda-arranger</p>
<p>861</p>
<p>The easiest way was to proclaim that Vyāsa, the author of the great Epio and of the distribution of Purānas into eighteen, was also responsible for the division or arrangement of the Veda. If all this glorification of Vyāga occurred in the centuries immediately preceding and following Christ, how could the supposed arranger of the Veda be mentioned in the early Vedic Literature, which, most scholars agree, was closed some centuries before Buddha (i.e. before the 6th century B. C.)? No body claims that the arrangement into mandalas or astakas or kāṇdas is eternal. It is only the hymns or mantras that are claimed to be eternal. Even the padapātha of the Rgveda is declared to be non-etornal and is ascribed to Sākalya whom tbe Nirakta criticises in VI, 28. Viśvarūpa on Yāj. III. 242 expressly states that the pada and krama arrangements of the Veda are due to human authors.1394 This theory explains all matters and has far better claims to be accepted than Pargiter&rsquo;s bold ascription of fraudulent suppression inferred from (&amp; suppogod) silence.</p>
<p>The Purānas do not speak with one voice about their own origin and transmission. After declaring that Vyāsa entrusted the preservation and propagation of the Puranas to Sūta, the Vāyu and other Purāṇas contain a somewhat different version. The Vāyu narrates (61. 55-61): Sūta had six disciples, vis, Suniti Atreya, Akstavraṇa Kāśyapa, Agnivarcas Bhārdvaja, Mitrayu Vasiṣtha, Sāvarṇi Saumadatti, Suśarman Sāmśapāyana. Three of these, viz. Kāśyapa, Sāvarpi and Sāmsapāyana prepared new Purana-aambitās and Sūta&rsquo;s own was the 4th and the original one. All were divided into four kāndas, contained the name sense (matter), but differed in their readings as the sūkhas of the Veda differ. All had four thousand verses except tho namhita of Samsapāyana. These four are said to be the basic saribitās (in Brahmāṇda II. 35. 66 ) or original samhitas (in Vāyu 61, 58 pūrvasambitās). The Brahmānda (II. 35. 63–70) has the same account in almost in the same words. Viṣnu (IL. 6. 16-17), Agni 271 (11-12) are briefer but agree in the main with Vayu. The Bhagavāta (XII. 7.467) differs from all these to some extent. That there is some substance in this story appears from stray passages in several chapters of the Vayu (56.1, 60. 33-34, 62. 1, 89. 16) and the Brahmapda (IL. 34, 34,</p>

<p>II. 36. 1 &amp;o.), where samsampāyana is the inquirer and Sāta replies.</p>
<p>The personality of Sūta is somewhat of an enigma in the Mahābhārata and the Purāṇas, Sūta is called Romaharṣaṇa 1395 or Lomaharṣap&amp; because he made the hair (roman or loman) of his audience bristle or stand erect by his touching and eloquent speech. In the Skanda it is stated that he was so called because his own hair stood on end when he was being instructed by Draipāyana. One meaning of the word sūta is chrioteer&rsquo; and another meaning is &lsquo;a person of a mixed prafiloma caste born of the union of a brāhmaṇa woman with a kṣatriya male&rsquo; and the cognate word &lsquo;Magadha&rsquo; means &lsquo;one who is born of a pratiloma union between a vaiśya male and a ksatriya female&rsquo; (vide Manu X. 71. Yāj. I. 93-94). The Arthaśāstra of Kautilya says 13% the same thing about sūta and māgadha, but adds that *the gūta and migadha mentioned in the Puranas are diffe rent from these, because he (the sūta) is distinguished from (ordinary) brāhmaṇas and kṣatriyas&rsquo;. Kautilya means that in his days sūta and māgadba were pratiloma castes, but the sūta and magadha mentioned as the first reciters of the Purāṇas are a category apart, that they do not belong to the pratiloma castes and are both distinguished from brāhmaṇas and kṣatriyas (ie, söta of the Purāṇās is treated more or less as a great sage or semi divine person). The Vayu (1. 26–33 and 62–147 ff), Padma (II. 27. 65-87, V. 1. 29-32), Brahmāṇda (II, 36. 158-173), the Skanda (Prabbāsakhapda 1. 8) say 1397 that in the sacrifice of Pitāmaha (i. o. Brahmā) Sūta sprang up as a partial avatara of Viṣnu on</p>

<p>The origin of sūta and Magadha</p>
<p>863</p>
<p>the day when soma juice was extracted and māgadha also thus arose. It is further stated in the same Purāpas that the havis (offering) meant for Indra (symbol of the ksatriya class) got mixed with that meant for Bṛhaspati ( symbol of brābmaṇa class and learning) and that the sūta was born just at the time when the mixed-up offering was presented to the gods. From this the gūta ( in later times) had duties similar to those of the original gūta and it was said that the sūta is offspring of the mized union of brāhmaṇa (woman) with ksatriya (male). Then another story is grafted on to this ( in Vāyu 62. 147 ff, Brahmānda II. 36. 170-173 and in others ) that the original 1398 Sūta and Magadha sang the praises of king Pșthu, son of Vona, who being pleased, made a present of the country of Anūpa to Sūta and the country of Magadha to Māgadha and since that time gūtas and māgadhas sing the praises of kings and awaken them in the morning with blessings. The Vāyu itself, 1399 however, gays (1. 33-34 ) that sūta was born at the time of the extracting of soma juice in the sacrifice of Pșthu Vainya</p>
<p>The authors of the extant Vāyu and other Puriṇas are conscious that the gūta and māgadha in their times had no adhikara for Veda, that the business of the sūta was to note the dynasties of goda, sages and kings that are found in the Itihāga and Purāṇas. They felt scandalized by the fact that great sages like Saunaka were said to have learnt Purāṇas from the sata who in their times belonged to a pratiloma caste, about which Gautama, Viṣpudharmasutra and Kautilya himself lay down that pratilomas are like gūdras, are condemned by aryas and are</p>

<p>beyond the pale of the usual duties of brāhmaṇas and ksatriyas ( such as upanayana, Veda study, teaching &amp;o.). Learning by a brāhmapa from a ksatriya was considered even in Upaniṣad times as contrary to the natural order of things. Vide the words of king Ajātasatru to Gārgya Bālāki 1400 quoted below. Therefore, to account for the position of Sūta as instructor in Itibāsa and Purāṇa of great sages like Saunaka, the story of Sūta&rsquo;s birth was invented and he was placed in a separate category by himself. This must have occurred some centuries before Kautilya who was aware of the low position of sūta and magadha and differentiates the Paurāṇika sūta from the prati loma sūta and māgadha. One need not accept the divine character of Sūta, one has only to understand that in very ancient times brāhmaṇas could, without any qualms and with out loss of prestige, learn about legends from a sūta, but that in the times when the extant purānas were compiled the position had entirely changed.</p>
<p>Next to Pargiter and Kirfel, one must mention the name of Prof. R. C. Hazra who has bestowed much labour and thought on the purāṇas in general and on individual purānas. One cannot but feel high admiration for Prof. Hazra&rsquo;s industry, patience and enthusiasm. One regrets, however, to find that ho has developed a tendency to assign rather more ancient dates to the extant Puranas and Upapurāpas than the available evidence would warrant. Besides, he has been so much engrossed in the study of Puranas that he sometimes scents &amp; reference to Purāṇas where none in fact exists. For example, in &lsquo;Puranio Tecords on Hindu rites and customs&rsquo; (p. 6) Prof. Hazra observes that Vijñāneśvara tells us of Hārsta&rsquo;s reference to the opinion of Puranas in prescribing penance in normal circumstances to those who eat the food dedicated to the patriarchs.

About eating food in saddhas of various kinds it quotes several authorities as follows: हारतेनाप्युक्तम् । एकादशाहे मुक्त्वा भुक्त्वा सशंयने तथा। उपोव्य विधिवत्स्नाखा कूष्माण्ड खेड्यातम् ॥ इति । विष्णुनाप्युक्तम् । प्राजापत्यं नवश्राद्धे&hellip;पञ्चगव्यं द्विमासिके इदं चाप हिषयम् । अनापदि -&lsquo;चान्द्रापर्ण नबन्नाद्ध प्राजापत्यं तु मिश्रके। एकाहस्त पुराणेषु प्राजा</p>

<p>below and olearly show that there the word &lsquo;purāneṣu&rsquo; means &ldquo;Sraddhas called purana&rsquo; and has nothing to do with Purana works. Another defect noticed in Prof. Hazra&rsquo;s writings is that he sees too much meaning in simple words and phrases and is not cautious in his conclusions as a scholar of his standing and experience should be. In a recent paper on the Aśvamedha, the common source of origin of the Purana Pancalaksapa and the Mahābhārata&rsquo; in ABORI, vol. 36 (1956) pp. 190-203, he cites the Atharvavada verso quoted above (p. 816, n 1325) in which pk and sāma verses are mentioned separately and &lsquo;purāna&rsquo; (purā. pam yajuṣa saha) is associated with yajus, and says this collocan tion seemed to him bighly significant and that he felt fully convinced that the Purāṇa pancalaksana and the Mahabharata owe their origin to the Aśvamedha sacrifice and especially to its Pāriplava ākhyānas. Reasons of available space preclude a detailed examination of this paper. But a few fundamental objections and matters must be mentioned. The words &lsquo;purāṇam yajuṣā saha&rsquo; should ordinarily mean (as in passages like Devadattaḥ saputra āgatah) no nore than &lsquo;Purāns and Yajus&rsquo;. Yāj. 1. 101 provides 1 402 that after the daily bath, a vedic householder should undertake every day the jape of portions of the (three) Vedas, the Atharvaveda, Puranas together with Itihasa and of adhyātmiki-vidyā (Upaniṣads). There is no special meaning here in the association &lsquo;parāṇāni setihāgāni&rsquo; beyond &lsquo;Purāpas and Itihāsa&rsquo;. One, therefore, fails to under stand how the words &lsquo;purānam yajuṣā saha&rsquo; are highly signi ficant for arriving at the conviction that Aśvamedha is the origin of Purāpa and Mahābhārata. Then on p. 20% of the paper</p>
<p>(Continued from løst page) Sraddhas are of three kirds, mar (up to ten days after death). Ang or pern ( performed after ten days up to one year ) and getur (those performed after a year from a person&rsquo;s death). The word gerong means yang mag हारीत provides मायश्चित्त for eating the food in the three kinds of माद्धम, नष, far and girl. The word gemony in that verse of grsta bas nothing to do with Parāng works. Vide H, of Dh, vol. IV. p. 262 notes 591a and 593 for more details about the three kinds of Sraddhas.</p>

<p>History of Dharmadāstra ( Seo. IV, Oh. XXII</p>
<p>in question Prof. Hazra quotes &amp; passage from 1403 Saṅkari dārya&rsquo;s bhāsya on Chandogya III. 4. 1-2 and completely misun derstands the great acārya when he observes “Saṅkara&rsquo;s use of the word &lsquo;rātri&rsquo; in the plural (id &lsquo;rātriṣu&rsquo;) shows that in his opinion the Itihāsa and Purāṇa were employed every night during the Pāriplava and not merely on the sth and oth nights respectively, as the Satapatha Br. and Sāṅkhāyanaśrautasutra say&rdquo; (Italios author&rsquo;s). The Aśvamedha sacrifice lasted for a year and listening to the Pāriplava went on for a year, each Pāripla va being a cycle of ten days (or rather nights, as the recitation by the hotr priest was to take place after the morning, mid-day and evening istis to Savitr were finished). The texts to be recited and the nature of the legends to be Darrated on each of the cycle of ten days are fixed and Itihāsa and Purāṇa are to be recited only on the 8th and 9th nights. As each cycle was of ten days, there would be 36 cycles of Pāriplava in a year and Itihasa would be recited on 36 nights in the year and Purāṇa also would be recited on 36 nights in the year. It is for this reason that Saṅkarācārya speaks of *Pāriplavāsu rātriṣu&rsquo; in the plural, but he does not say that Itihāsa and Purāpa were to be recited on all' nights (sarrāsu rātriṣu), while Prof. Hazra represents him as so saying. There is absolutely no warrant in the ancient texts for saying that on each day (or night) of the Pāriplava Itihāsa or Purāṇa was to be recited or that Saṅkarācārya said anything of the kind. The testimony of the Vedāntasūtra 1404 is completely against this view of Prof. Hazra. Vedāntasūtra III. 4. 23 refers to certain stories mentioned in the Upanisads such as &lsquo;Yājñavalkya had two wives, Maitreyi and Katyāyani&rsquo; (Br. Up. IV. 5. 1), &lsquo;Pratardana, son of Divodāsa, went to Indra&rsquo;s abode&rsquo; (Kauṣi taki Up. III. 1), &ldquo;Jānaśruti Pautrāyaṇa was a pious donor giving much wealth to the people and keeping an open house for distributing food' (Chān. Up. IV.1.1), and remarks that such stories were not to be recited in Pāriplava, since the stories to be recited therein are expressly specified beginning with the story</p>

<p>Prof. Hazra and Prof. Dikshitar on Purānas</p>
<p>867</p>
<p>of king Manu Vaivasvata (which was to be recited on the first night of the Pariplava).</p>
<p>Prof. Hazra has recently published (in 1958) Studies in the Upapurāṇas' vol. I pp. 1-400 on Saura and Vaisnava Upa purāṇas (in the Calcutta Sanskrit College Research Series 1958). This would be briefly dealt with a little later.</p>
<p>Prof. Ramchandra Dikshitar also has written a good deal on the Purāṇas. His writings are boset by the same infirmity that attaches to Prof. Hazra&rsquo;s work to some extent. For example, in &amp; paper published in the Proceedings of the 13th Indian History Congress (pp. 46-50) on the Viṣnupurāṇa he first states (p. 46) that he is more concerned with the extant Vispupurāna and after pointing out that the topics of yratas, of fasts, of tirtha, are absent from the extant Vispupurāṇa he concludes that the extant Viṣnupurāna can safely be placed in the 6th or 7th century B. C. Hardly any modern and critical scholar would accept such a date for the extant Viṣnupurāṇa. Instead of relying on the absence of certain topics he should rather have relied on what it actually contains to find out the probable date of the. extant Viṣnupurāṇa.</p>
<p>In connection with the Purāṇas the author must refer at some length to the Introductory remarks of Ballalagona, king of Bengal, in his Dānasagara, edited in the B. I series (1953-1956 ) by Mr. Bhabatosh Bhattacārya (three parts of text pp. 1-722 and 4th part an Introduction in English with Indices). Those remarks evince a bold critical faculty rare in our medieval Sanskrit writers. He mentions, besides the Gopathabrāhmaṇa, the Rāmāyaṇa, the Mahābhārata, the smrtis and dharmaśāstras of Gautama, Manu, Yājnavalkya, (count ing Saṅkha Likhita ag two ), Dāna-Bṛhaspati and Bṛhaspati (as separate), Vasiṣtha and others (in all 28), the Chandoga-pari śiṣta of Kātyāyana, thirteen principal Puriṇas viz. Brāhma, Vārāba, Agneya, Bhavisya, Mātsya, Vāmana, Vāyaviya, Mārkandeya, Vaiṣpava, śaiva, Skānda, Pādma and Kaurma and the Upapurānas named in Kūrma and Adi Purāṇas as contain: ing the procedure of various ) dānas, viz. Ādya, Samba, Kālikā, Nānda (v.1 Nandin), Aditya, Narasimha, Viṣnudharmottara (declared by Mārkandeya) and the sastra called Viṣnudharina (eight in all). He mentions that he drow upon all these for the produotion of his work on dāpas, 1375 in number ( verses 11-20</p>

<p>Some of these remarks are very important and the original verses are set out in the note below. 1405 He states that he did. not draw upon the Bhāgavata, the Brahmānda and the Nāradiya as dānas are absent therefrom. He did not rely in his work upon the Lingapurāṇa, though it is a large work, because its essence, he decides, is the same as the treatment of Maha. dānas declared in the Matsyapurāṇa; the Bhavisyapurāṇa has been assiduously utilised by him only up to the ( vratavidhis of ) 7th tithi, but he discards the procedures of the 8th and 9th tithis (of the Bhavisyapurana), since they are overwhelmed (tainted) with (the doctrines of )1406 heretical sects (Tantrikas,</p>

<p>Some important conclussions can be drawn from the above mentioned remarks of Ballalasena in his Dānasāgara. Next to the Mitakṣarā, the Kṛtyakalpataru and Aparārka&rsquo;s commentary, the Dānasāgara is among the earliest extant nibandha works the dates of which are nearly certain. 1407 If does not mention the Mitāksarā, nor Krtyakalpataru nor Aparārka. Mr. Bhabatosh Bhattācbārya is right in bis contention that the words &lsquo;Kalpa drumo jangamah&rsquo; in the 3rd opening vorge have nothing to do with Kalpataru of Lakṣmidhara and that Prof. Rangaswamy Aiyangar is wrong in thinking that the verse refers to the Kalpataru ( vide Mr. Bhattācbārya&rsquo;s Introduction to Danasāgara p. XVIII and note 1).</p>
<p>The principal points that emerge from Ballālasena&rsquo;s remarks on Purāṇas are that he included both Vāyu and Siva among the principal Purāṇas (sometimes called Mahāpurāṇas), that there were two Purānas called Linga, Brahma, Āgney&amp; and Viṣnu, that the four counterparts bearing these names were not treated as authoritative (one pseudo-Lingapurāṇa having 6000 verses and one Vispu having also 23000 verses being unautho ritative), that he abhorred Tantrik rites and therefore totally discarded the Devipurāṇa and parts of Bhavisya, that he did not utilize three named sections of the Skanda, that he did not regard the Garuda as authoritative. It may be stated here that acc. to the printed) Kūrma I. 1. 17-20 some Upapurāpas such as Skanda, Vamana, Brahmānda and Nāradiya bear the same names as the Mahapuraṇas. Prof. Hazra relies upon a passage quoted from the Bhavisyapurāṇa 1:08 by Kalpataru (Brahmacari</p>

<p>kāṇda p. 25) wherein it is said that the appellation Jaya is applied to 18 Puranas, Rāmāyaṇa, Vigpudharmādiśāstras, Siva dharma, Mahābharata, Sauradharmas and Manayadharmas (Manusmrti?). I shall discuss the question of Viṣnudharma purāna later. But I have serious objections against the antiquity and authenticity of this passage. Being quoted in the Kalpataru it may be earlier than 1050 A. D. That is all. In order to glorify the 18 Purāṇas the meaning of Jaya is extended. Jaya is applied only to the Mahābhārata in the latter e.g. Udyogaparva 136. 18-19 and Svargārohanika 5. 49 and 51 quoted in note 1369 above. Hence this passage was inserted very late after all 18 Purāṇas had been composed i.e. after the 9th century AD. Besides the plural Viṣnudharmādiśāstrāṇi' shows that many works are meant and not one, i.e. the meaning is that all śāstras dealing with Viṣnudharmas and the like. If a single work were meant, one expects &lsquo;Viṣnudharmādiśāstram ca&rsquo; and that would have not spoilt the metre. Besides, the Kalpataru itself indioates that this verse about &lsquo;Jaya&rsquo; was cited by some authorities as * Smrti'. Therefore, it is doubtful if it is a genuine Bhavisya passage. Ballālasena mentions only eight Upapurānas on danas by name (including the four mentioned by the Matsya).</p>
<p>In spite of the very admirable and praiseworthy efforts of Dr. Hazra in the matter of the place of the Upapurāṇas, their contents, the search among numerous mss. to find out what the text of the several apapurānas has been, the present writer must say here once for all that he does not at all agree with most of the dates that he assign to the Sāmba, the Vispadharma, the Viṣnudharmottara, the Narasimhapurāṇa, which are the principal Upapurānas he has dealt with in the first volume of &lsquo;Studies in Upapurāṇas&rsquo;. His dates for the four Upapurāṇas are;</p>

<p>Samba between 500 and 800 A..D. (p. 91), the Viṣnudharma purāṇa between 200-300 A. D. (p. 143), the Viṣnudharmottara purāpa between 400 to 500 A. D. (p. 212) and the present Narasimha-purāna between 400 to 500 A. D. To examine all his reasons the present writer would have to write another book. Therefore, he proposes to give only a few illustrations of the way in which Dr. Hazra arrives at his dates. But before this is done it is better to mention some of his own findings on the Purānas and the four Upapurāṇas mentioned above. On p. 27 he observes that the text of the extant Mahāpurāṇas which are the results of innumerable changes, modifications and interpola tions made at different times and by different sects is scarcely reliable and can be used with great caution and careful discrimination. I agree with him. But the same or perhaps worse is the case with the Upapurāṇas. Prof. Hazra himself says (&ldquo;Studies&rsquo; vol. I. p. 23) that after the group of 18 principal Purānas had been compiled many sub-systems and sects like the Sāktas and Sauras came into prominence and their adherents interpolated chapters in the 18 established Purāṇas and wrote new and independent works styled Purānas in order to propagate their own ideas and that some of these latter came to be called Upapurāṇas. The result is that, unless we have critical editions of the Purānas and the principal Upapurānas on the model of the critical edition of the Mahābhārata at the BORI in Poona, all chapters and often single verges are suspect. But the task of preparing critical editions of oven the principal Purāṇas and some of the Upapurānas based upon ancient and medieval mss. collected from all parts of India would be far more colossal and costly than even the critical edition of the Mahābhārata. Therefore, most chronological conclusions about the dates of Purānas and Upapurāṇas and about the borrowings of one Purana from another are just tentative at the most and likely to be set aside by new evidence as long as oritical editions of Puranas and Upapurāṇas are not available.</p>
<p>Let us now turn to the four Upapurānas dealt with at longth by Prof. Hazra. About the Samba (which is one of the four Upapurānas expressly named in the Matsyapurāna 53. 60_63) Prof. Hazra observes (&ldquo;Studies&rsquo; vol. I. p. 68 ) that the present Samba-purāṇa consists of different units mostly belong ing to different countries and ages and after analysing in his Own way the several chapters of the Samba he arrives at the conclusion (on p. 93) that chapters 17, 22 and 23 of the printed</p>
<p>Date of the Samba Purarā</p>
<p>the 9th centur Matsya, but one about the Flood</p>
<p>edition were added later than 950 A. D., that chap. 44-45 &lsquo;wers inserted between 950 and 1050 A. D. and chap. 39-43 and 47-83 were added between 1250 and 1500 A. D. There is at present only one printed ed. of the Samba viz. that of the Vonk. Press in 84 chapters based probably only on one ms. Out of these 84 chapters Prof. Hazra himself finds that 47 chapters are later than 950 A. D., of which 4% were added between 1250-1500 A. D. Prof. Hazra has himaself examined several mass of the Samba, but they do not come from all over India, many being from Bengal and almost all seem to be late ones (p. 33 last line), being copied in saka 1764 i. e. 1842 A, D. When more than half of this Purana ranges between 950 to 1500 AD. according to Prof. Hazra, how can it be usefully employed for chronological purposes? Nobody can say when the verses about the four Upapurānas were inserted in tbe Matsya, but one can affirm that it was done about the 9th century A. D. or even later. Two datos about Upapurāṇas are certain, viz. that Samba is mentioned by Alberuni (Bachau, I. p. 130) who wrote in 1030 Å. D. and that the Dānasāgara (verses 13-15 on p. 3), composed in 1069 A.D. mentions eight Upapurānas on dānas of which four viz. Samba, Narasimha, Nandi and Aditya are the same as are mentioned in the Mataya. Therefore, an Upapurāpa called Samba must have been composed a century or two earlier than 1000 A. D. On p. 91 he holds that the Samba cannot be dated later than 800 A. D. It is difficult to fall in line with all the assumptions on pp. 90-91 for arriving at this date. What the Sāmba named by Matsya contained beyond the words story of Simba&rsquo; is not at all known. Prof. Hazra himself has given up at least half of the printed Samba as later than 950 A. D. and there is absolutely</p>
<p>no reliable evidence to hold that the remaining portion of the</p>
<p>• Sāmba is earlier than 800 A. D. or even earlier than 950 A. D..</p>
<p>The next Upapurāna is Viṣnudharma dealt with by Prof. Hazra in Studios' VOL I. pp. 118–155. There is no printed edition. Prof. Hazra (p. 119) refers to six mss. but he has chiefly used only one ms. viz. Bengal Asiatic Society&rsquo;s ms. No. 1670. This Purāpa has 105 chapters and over 4000 verses. Prof. Hazra admits (p. 119 ) that it has very little of the principal charac teristios of a Purāṇa and deals exclusively with the religious rites and duties of Vaiṣpavas. Alberuni names Vis udharma but the verses that he quotes therefrom are found in the Viṣpu dharmottara as Bühler pointed out long ago (I A. VOL. XIX. pp. 381-410 and vide table given by Prof. Hazrs on p. 208 comparing the two ). Prof. Hazra holds (p. 116 ) relying on two verses quot</p>

<p>History of Dharmasastra (Beo. IV, Ch. XXII</p>
<p>ed below from Viṣnudharmottara 1408a that the Viṣyudharnottara is only the latter part of Vispudharma and that, as he holds that the former was composed between 400-500 A. D., the date of the Virpudharma falls between 200 and 300 A. D. (p. 143 ). The other arguments that he advances are practically worthless. In the present author&rsquo;s opinion those verses can be interpreted in two other but different ways, viz. that the first section of the present Viṣnudharmottara is called Visṇudharma or that the Viṣnudharmottara is so called because it was composed after the Viṣnupurāṇa, which contains the greatness of Visnu and the dharmas of Vaiṣpavas. He often trots out the theory that, if a work is free from Tantric elements, it must be an early work be. longing to the 3rd or 4th century A.D. (see p. 142). The Sarvada TS&amp;Desangraha of Mādhavācārya (which was composed in the 14th century ) makes no reference to the cult of Sakti or the system of Tantra, though it devotes &amp; good deal of space to the views of ovon Carvāka ( a thorough-going atheist), Bauddhas and Jainas. The Sarvasiddhāntasangraha also does not refer to the Sāktas or the Tantras. But no one can argue that Madhava is earlier than 4th or 5th century A.D. There may be various reasons for silence, One may ablor a thing and may not refer to it or use it at all as the Dānasāgara says about the Devipurāpa. The argument from silence is a slippery one. I challenge the whole basis of Prof. Hazra&rsquo;s date for Viṣnudharma, viz. the date of the Viṣnu. dharmottara. This last is a vast work in three sections. It would be proved later that portions of the latter Purina dealing</p>

<p>The Viṣnudharmotiara</p>
<p>875</p>
<p>with prognostications from dreams cannot be placed earlier than about 600 to 650 A. D. For the Viṣnudharina we have to rely on what Prof. Hazra quotes. · Chap. 66 quotes the famous words of the Gitā whenever there is decline of dharma &amp;c.' (p. 143 n. 94 ) and then the same chap. mentions the incarna tions of Viṣnu including Buddha (p. 125 ). Therefore, the mention of the ten avatāras in the context of the words of the Gitā is natural and should not be regarded as spurious simply because it comes in the way of one&rsquo;s pet theories. On p. 144 be quotes ton versos from chapter 66 in which Buddha is described As son of Suddhodana and his doctrines are stated. Prof. Hazra (on pp 145–146) gives four reasons which are quite unconvincing. The Purānas mention the avatāras of Viṣnu in several places. The Bhāgavata in I 3 names 22 avatāras. On p. 150 Prof. Hazra himself quotes a long passage about the evils of the Kali age from the Viṣnudharma in which occurs a signifioant half verse &lsquo;utkocaḥ saugatās-caiva Mahāyānaratās-tathā&rsquo;. Hore not only are the followers of Buddha mentioned but also those who are of the Mahāyāna persuasion. On p. 124 Prof. Hazra states that the Viṣnudharma (p. 124 11. 45 ) mentions by name 33 authors of Dharmaśāstras, besides the Saptarsis and others. Yāj. (1. 4-5) mentions only 19 promulgators of Dharmaśāstra (including himself and holding Saṅkha-likhita as one ). Both the Viṣnu dharma and the Viṣnudharmottara are not mentioned by the Matsya. Therefore, it must be held that they were not reca gnized as Upapurāṇas at the time when the verses about Upa purāgas were interpolated in the Matsya and were not so recog. nized till at least the 8th or 9th century A. D. The Viṣnudbarma is opposed to what is stated by all writers from the Grhya and Dharmasūtras, by Manu (III. 128–186 ), by Matsya, Kūrma and other Purāṇas about the qualifications of the brahmaṇas to be invited at a sraddha dinner ( vide H. of Dh. vol. IV pp. 384-387). It expressly says that squint-eyed, bunch-backed, impotent, poor and diseased brāhmaṇas should be mixed up at a śrāddha along with those who are deeply versed in the Veda, 1409 This does not bespeak an early date. (On p. 138 Prof. Hazra refers to several nibandhakāras as quoting from Viṣpudharms such as Gadadhara up to Ballālasena, Aparārka and Kṛtyakalpataru. These do not carry the data beyond 1000 A. D. and besides an examination of quotations in only one work ( Aparārka) will show that the</p>

<p>History of Dharmaśāstra (SecIV, Oh. XXI</p>
<p>Viṣnudharma was an botoh-potoh bringing together passages from several souroes ( vide note ). 1410 Prof. Hazra himself holda that the original Viṇpudharma was appropriated and recast by Bhagavatas and that many verses quoted from Vispudharma by Raghunandana, Govindānanda and the Madanapīrijata do not occur in the present work ( pp. 154-155 ).</p>
<p>Then we come to the Vizpudharmottara. The only printed edition is that of the Venk. Press. It is a vast work divided into three sections. The first deals with geography, solar and lunar dynasties, astronomy and astrology, gotra and pravara, śrāddhas, Manvantaras, Bharata&rsquo;s fight with Gandharvas and Satrughoa&rsquo;s with Lavana. The 2nd section deals with various aspects of Rāja dharma and the third section of the Purāpa deals with Citragūtra vidhāna and contains several topics such as painting, dancing, music, song, ragas, riddles, dramaturgy, metrics, figures of speech, construction of images, building of temples, symptoms of approaching death, gifts of various kinds, law and justice, hermits and sanngāsins. On p. 212 Dr. Hazra places this Purana bet ween 400-500 A. D. Reasons of limitations of space preclude any detailed criticism of Prof. Hazra&rsquo;s treatment. In III, 351.54 Buddha ia mentioned as an avatāra which Prof. Hazra says is &lsquo;most probably spurious&rsquo; (p. 212) and advances no reasons for this summary judgment. He puts in his usual argument of its non Tantric 1411 character and frequent use of the word prādurbhava</p>

<p>and not avatara' which lattor, he says, occurs in two places only. Prof. Hazre often attaches undue importance to insignificant details. Whether the word &lsquo;prādurbhava&rsquo; is used or &lsquo;ayatāra&rsquo; is used matters little. The same Purāpa uses both words promise uously e. 8. Narasitaha (36. 1, &lsquo;avatarāpaham yaksye&rsquo;) begins with the word &lsquo;avatāra ' and in 39, 1 employs the word &lsquo;prādar bhāva&rsquo;(ataparam Hareḥ punyam prādurbbāvam) and in the colophons of all chapters from 36 to 53 the word &lsquo;prādurbhāya&rsquo; is used. The Matsya 247, 1 starts with &lsquo;prādurbhāvān para poṣu Viṣporamitatejasaḥ&rsquo;. In 247. 19-21 the Matsya employs the word ' avatirpah &lsquo;with regard to Vamana and Nṛsimha and in 246, 4 avatirgo jagadyonih &ldquo;** **Vāinanonoha rūpona &amp;c.&rsquo;. Padma V. 13. 182 speaks of twelve avatāras; Vispu V. 16 also uges the word &lsquo;ayatāra! On p. 199 he gives a table of passages that are common to Manu, Yaj., Nārada und Vispudharmottara, OD P. 200 another table of passages common to Bharata&rsquo;s Natya Sāstra and Viṣnudbarmottara, and on page 202 a table of paggages common to Matsya and Viṣpudharmottara end holds that the Matsya borrows. This is a most astounding proposition The Matsya does not even mention the Viṣoudharmottara as an Upaparāṇa; the only gure and earliest date is that the latter is mentioned by Alberuni. That does not carry the matter beyond 900-1000 A. D. The Matsyapurāpa might have been tampered with. The reasons assigned for his opinion by Prof. Hazra are, to say the least, flimsy and unconvincing. It is further to be noted that there are twelve verses that state that some phenomena are not to be held to be utpātas, that are common to Matsya 229. 14-25, Visṇudharmottara ( II. 134. 15-26 ) and the Bṛbatsarghita ( 45. 83-94), which are quoted by the Adbhutasāgars pp. 743-744 as occurring in all these three and in Bārhaspatya. I have dealt with this matter above on p. 768 n 1240. Varāha states that these</p>

<p>History of Dharmaśāstra (Soo. IV, Oh. Xat</p>
<p>verses are the summaries (rsiputrakrtaih slokair-vidyād-etat samasoktaih) of the slokas of Rṣiputra. Therefore, the view that they are borrowed by Varāba from the Matsya or Vispudharmo ttara would be out of question. The two Purāṇas do not say whence they have taken them. Therefore, it would not be unjustifiable to hold that in both Purāṇas the verges of the Bphat-samhita were inserted. There is another circumstance that strengthens this last view. The Adbhutasāgara on pp. 493-494 quotes geven verses from the Bșhad-yātrā of Varāba alone. These verses are quoted by Utpala on Br, S. 47. 2% (where Varāba says &lsquo;sadasat - Svapnanimittam yātrāyām svapnavidhir-uktaḥ) from Yatrā&rsquo;. These verses ( 8 in all) are Varāha&rsquo;s own (as he says) and not taken from any other source. Three of these verses on dreams occur in the Viṣnudharmottara (II. 176. 9-11). They are quoted above on p. 776 note 1254. Prof. Hazra does not appear to have carefully gone into the several works of Varāhamihira and is not right when he says (on pp. 201 and 211 ) that the Viṣṇudharmottara does not refer to or utilize the works of Varābamihira&rsquo;. The Viṣnu dbarmottara is an encyclopaedia, while Varāhamihira was &amp; great astronomer and astrologer. He would turn to his predecessors in his own subject if he wanted to borrow and he expresaly mentions numerous predecessors (vide pp. 591-594 above) and not to an Upapurāṇa (which in my viow did not exist or at least was not recognised as an authority when Varāba wrote in the first half of the 6th century A. D.) Besides, the presumption to be drawn from the nature of the Upapurāṇa is in favour of bolding that it borrows.</p>
<p>Prof. Hazra deals with the Narasimha-purāṇa on pp. 219-266 of his &lsquo;Studies&rsquo; vol. I. The only printed edition is that published in 1911 by Gopal Narayan and Co. (Bombay) in 68 chapters based on three mss. about which no information is given This Purana appears to have been composed solely for the glorification of Nara simha identified with Nārāyana. Prof. Hazra has used several msa., two, the oldest, being dated in saka 1567 ( i.e. 1645 A. D.), some of the others are not dated and a few are dated so late as 1798 A. D. and 1810 A. D.; and some are written in Bengali soript. On p. 322 Prof. Hazra says about one mg. in Eggeling&rsquo;s oat, of India Ofice mags, that it was copied about 1500-1600 AD. and its last five folios were supplied in 1789 A. D. No reasons are given why this ms. should be regarded as being copied between 1500 1600. This is probably a guess, so all the mss. consulted are not earlier than the 17th and following centuries.

<p>The Vignudharmottara</p>
<p>879</p>
<p>agree with the printed edition in the number of chapters and also lack oertain chapters of the printed edition. Prof. Hazra holds (p. 242) OR.various grounds, all of which cannot be examined hore, that the present Narasimbapurāṇa is to be placed between 400-500 A D.&rsquo; One or two of his characteristic arguments will be noticed here. In chap. 36. 9 (kalau prāpte yathā Buddho bhaven-Nārāyaṇaḥ prabhuḥ) Buddha is mentioned; Mārkan. deya promises in chap. 36 to narrate stories about eloven avatāras ( among whom Balarama, Kyspa and Buddha are included) and in chapters 37-54, the stories of all avatāras except Buddha are given and it is added 1412 in chap. 54 that I have spoken of the ton incarnations of Viṣn. The devotee of NȚsimha who always listens to these attains Vispu'. It may be noted that Balabhadra is mentioned in a half verse (36. 8) which is found only in ms. &lsquo;ga&rsquo; of the three mss. of the printed edition. In ohap. 53 a fow exploits of Balarama and Krsna are narrated in the same chapter and so the half line was inserted later. As the story of Buddha is not given Prof. Hazra holds that the verse in 36. 9 is undoubtedly spurious (pp. 230 and 249). It never occurred to Prof. Hazra that the sectarian zeal of &amp; bigoted Vaiṣpaya might have never cared to give the life of Buddha who was not concerned with (but was antagonistic to ) the varpa system and the Vedas or might have omitted the story of the life of Buddha even if it oocurred in the ms. from which he copied. The prosent author thinks that 36.9 is a genuine verse and enumerates Buddha as an avatāra following the universal belief held in India at least from the 9th or 10th century A. D. that Buddha was an avatāra, but probably bigotry led to the omission of the details of Buddha&rsquo;s life. Besides, the verse is capable of another interpretation. It is only the stories of ten avatāras (excluding Buddha) that lead &amp; devoted to Visgu. A devotee may worship any one of Nṛsimba, Rāma or Krona, and reach Vispu, but hardly any orthodox work has ever stated that worship of Buddha alone (an avatara) will load to attainment of Viṣnu. Therefore, it is proper to hold that the story of Buddha&rsquo;s life might not have been given at all or was purposely omitted. On. p. 239 Prof. Hasra pats forward a peculiar argument. According to the Narasimha-parāṇa obap. 53. 31. says Prof. Hazra, Kroṇa embodies only a part of Viṣnu&rsquo;s sakti 1413 and therefore the Narasimha is to be dated</p>

<p>earlier than the present Bhagavata in which Kropa is called bhagavān himself (Bhagavata I. 3. 28). As the present Bhaga vata is to be dated in the 6th century A. D. the Narasimha is to be placed not later than 300 A D.' Great controversies have raged over the date of the Bhagavata. The present author holds that the Bhagavata-purāpa does not belong to the 6th century A. D. It will be shown below that while Rāmānuja quotes more than a hundred verses from the Viṣnupurāpa, which he regarded as one of supreme authority over other Purānas (in Vedārtbasangraha pp. 141-142 of D. C. edition) he does not quote the Bhāgavata at all in his bhāsya on the Vedāntasūtra. A bigoted devotee of Narasimha may say that Narasimha avatāra is the perfect avatāra of Viṣnu, while Krspa is only a partial one. But surely that cannot determine the dates of the respective purāpas. What bigoted devotees are capable of saying may be seen from Brahmāṇda III. 36. 18-20 quoted later io this section, where it is asserted that the reward of repasting thrice the thousand names of Visnu is yielded by repeating one name of Kṭspa once. The strongest argument against the authenticity and early date of the present Nara simhapurāpa has not been properly and adequately emphasized or appreciated by Prof. Hazra. The Matsya (53.60-63) gives meagre details about the four Upapurānas expressly named by it, but about the Narasimha it makes one definite statement that it contained 18000 verses (53.60). The present Narasimha contains only about 3400 verses,1414 Therefore, the old Nara simhapurāṇa exists no more and in its place a new one has been substituted, probably containing some of the topics and chapters contained in the old one. We do not know the extent of the Narasimha mentioned by Alberuni. For ought we know he might have referred to the old extensive purāpa or the new stripling substituted in its place. Even some of the mss. copied in comparatively recent times drop several chapters of the printed purāṇa ; on p. 249 Prof. Hazra holds that chapters 34 verses 43-55, and chapters 61, 65 (on 68 holy places for Vaiṣpavas ), 66,67 are genuine parts, though dropped in</p>

<p>881</p>
<p>some mes. Prof. Hazra&rsquo;s judgments on various matters are most liable to be challenged; but considerations of space prevent any detailed treatment. On p. 252 he holds that in chap. 6 the story of the birth of Vasistha and Agastya as the song of Mitra and Varuṇa, the story of Yana and Yaml are comparatively late additions. The story of the birth of Vasistha from Urvasi and Mitra and Varuṇa is alluded to even in the Rgveda ( VII. 33. 11 ) and in the previous verse ( 10 ) of the same hymn Vasistha, Agastya and Mitrāvarunau are brought together. The story of Yama and Yami occurs in Rg. X. 10. The Narasimha itself states ( in chap. 14 1 ) that the story of Yama and Yami is Vaidiki. The Purāna may have added some fringes and embellishments, but the main theme is the same in both. On p. 254–255 and note 330 Prof. Hazra was constrained to admit that the Narasimha purāpa had been revised more than onco, remarks that Hemādri had a more extensive purāna before him than the printed one and that a comparison of the verges quoted from the Narasimha purāṇa by the Madanapārijāta pp. 301-302, Smrtitattva on āhnika (vol. I. p. 411 ) and Nityācārapradipa (vol. I p. 617) show that the text of the Narasimha used by Raghunandana and Narasimha-vājapeyin agrees more with the printed text than the text used by Madanapāla (about 1375 A, D.), less than 200 years before Raghunandana.</p>
<p>The extant Narasimhapurāṇa is an insignificant one as compared with the principal Purāṇas like Vāyu, Matsya, Vispu; the Sāmba is not quoted at all by Aparārka, the Viṣnudharma only twice and even the Visṇudharmottara is quoted by Aparārka only 7 times for about 25 perses in all. The very ex tensive digest Kalpataru (first half of 12th century A. D.) contains hardly any quotation from Viṣnudharmottara on vratas (though the latter devotes about 1600 verses to vratas), nor is it quoted in the sections on brahmacāri and other kāndas, while hundreds of verses are quoted from Matsya, Brahma, Bhavisya, Mārkapdeys and other Purāṇas. Aparārka in his huge digest of 1252 printed pages quotes the Narasimhapurāpa only 9 times and in all about 30 verses only, of which about half are in respect of sannyāsa, while the Brahmapurāṇa is quoted 68 times for hundreds of verses, the Matsya is quoted over 50 bi nes for several hundred verses. The Tulasi plant is now sacred to the devotees of Visṇu, but it does not figure in early Paurāpika or other literature. It is mentioned in chapters</p>

<li>87 ( in &amp; proge passage ) and 34 ( 19 and 23 ) of the printed Narasimhapurāṇa. As usual Prof. Hazra holds these references are due to later revisions and should not be held to suggest a late date for the extant Narasimhapurāṇa (p. 255 ). Tulasi. māhātmya is very much in evidence in the Padma e. g. in IV. 94. 4-10, V. 58. 109ff and V. 59, VI, 24, 2-43.

Prof. Hazra fails to realize the full force of his own admission that the Narasimha was revised several times and that writers of the 16th century had a version before them different from that before the writers of the 13th or 14th century. In the author&rsquo;s opinion the whole Furāṇa becomes suspect and that by mere diplomatio criticism one would not be able to support beyond doubt any chronological conclusion derived from the present truncated and garbled version of the original Narasimhan</li>

<p>So much space had to be devoted to an examination of Prof. Hazra&rsquo;s work on the Upapurāṇas for cogent reasons. His is the latest and most elaborate treatment of Purānas and parti cularly of Upapurāṇas, on which he has bestowed immense labour. His opinions, particularly about the dates of the Upapurāṇas, are likely to be taken as the last word on the subject and even his unfounded surmises are likely to be taken as well-established conclusions. Modern Sanskrit scholars have sad experience about such matters. Max Muller, working back from the date of Buddha and assigning arbitrarily two hundred years each for three periods viz. the Upaniṣad period, the Brāhmaṇa period and the Samhitā period, inferred that the composition of the Vedas was to be assigned to a period about 1200 B. C. Ho no doubt said that his periods were the minimum and that his was a pure surmise. Yet most writers who have not themselves made a deep study of the Veda assign the Vedas to about 1200 to 1400 B. O, even after the lapse of about one hundred years from the time when Max Muller launched his surmises. For example, Prof. Toynbee in the table of the time spans of the growth phases of civilizations on p. 758 of volume IX (1954) gives the dates of Epiphany and of breakdown of the Indic civilization as 1375 B.C. and 725 B. O. rospectively. The present author does not at all agree with the datos assigned to the Upapurāṇas by Prof. Hazra and with the methods and reasoning adopted for arriving at those dates. He had to perform this painful duty even in spite of his regard</p>
<p>for Prof. Hazra.</p>

<p>There are numerous works, translations and papers on Puriṇas. A few alone are mentioned here. Eugene Burnouf translated the Bhagavata Purāṇa in French in five volumes in 1840 and later years. The translations of Viṣṇu and Mārkandeya were made respectively by H. H. Wilson and Pargiter; Prof. Kirfel&rsquo;s Introduction to &lsquo;Purāna panoalaksana&rdquo; (1927, Bonn) was translated in the Journal of the Shri Venkataśa Institute, vol. VII pp. 81-121 and vol. VIII. pp. 9-33; Kirfel in Festschrift Jacobi pp. 298-316; K. P. Jayagwal on &lsquo;Chrono. logical tables in Puranic chronicles&rsquo; in J. B. O. R. S, VOL. III pp. 246–262; ' Purāṇas and Indus Aryas&rsquo; and &lsquo;Study of ancient Geography in Agoipurāṇa&rsquo; in I. H. Q.

Majmudar on &lsquo;Origin and character of Purāṇa literature&rsquo; in Sir Asutosh Mukharji Silver Jubilee vol. II, Orientalis, part 2 pp. 9-30; &amp; verse from p. 30 of &lsquo;Insoriptiones Sanskrites de Champa et du Cambodge&rsquo; refers to the provision made by &amp; king of the 6th century A. D. for the daily reading of the Bhārata, Rāmāyaṇa and Purāṇas; 14146 the Penukonda plates of the early Ganga king Madhava II, (E. I vol. 14 p. 338 ) speaks of him as knowing the essence of many sāstras, Itibāsa and Purāṇas&rsquo; (probably in 6th century A. D.); Purāṇas are mentioned as studied in 578 A. D. ( in E. I. vol. 28 p. 59 ).</p>
<p>In the following notes on individual Puranas and Upapurinas the author adds a few notes based on his own study of the Puranas and (printed) digests ( nibandhas ) of an early age. He desires to emphasize that the earliest works that can be called digeste and are available in print cannot be placed earlier than about 1100 A. D. Though there is difference of viows among scholars about the exact datos of composition, the Mitaksarā, the Kityan kalpataru (which is a regular Digest of various kinds of materials on Dharmaśāstra) and Aparārka&rsquo;s work (though in</p>

<p>884</p>
<p>History of Dharmatūstra (Soo. IV, Oh. XXII</p>
<p>form a commentary on Yajnavalkya-smrti is still in the nature of a Digest) are three printed works more or less contemporary and composed between about 1100 to 1140 A.D. The Kṛtya kalpataru on Vyavabāra mentions by name Prakāsa, Hala yudha, Kamadhenu and Pārijāta. Besides, Krityakalpataru ( Niyata p. 280) cites the explanation of Parārska (in Āp. Dh, S. I. 17. 26 ) by the Smrtimañjari ( of Govindarāja ) and also on śrāddha ( pp. 46 and 259 ). It has been shown in H. of Dh. vol. I that Prakāśa (pp. 306-308 ), Pārijāta (pp. 308–309), Smrtimañjari (pp. 312–314 ) were works of the digest genre. The Kāmadhenu of Gopāla also appears to have been a digest (H. of Dh. Vol. I. pp. 293 ff.). The author Gopāla was a friend of Laksmidhara (vide Introd. to Dānaka ada p. 49), but, since the latter employs the past tense (cakre) with reference to Gopala&rsquo;s work and the present tense ( tanyate kalpavrkṣaḥ) as regards his own work it follows that the Kamadhenu was composed at least a few years before the Kalpa taru. As no m88, of the Prakāsa, Pārijāta and Kamadhenu are available it is impossible to say anything about their exhaus tiveness or otherwise. But from the summary at the end of the ms. on the Prāgascitta section of the Smrtimañjari (H. of Dh. vol. I. p. 312 note 714) it appears that it must have been fairly large and was composed on the same lines as the later Kftya kalpataru, since it began with Paribhāṣākānda and Brahmacāri section, then dealt with Gṛbasthadbarmas, Dana, Suddhi and Āśauca, Srāddha, then with Vānaprastha and Pravrajya (corresponding to the mokṣakānda of Kalpataru ) and ended with Prāyaścittas. These predecessors of the Kalpataru wore superseded by the extensive work of Lakṣmidhara, who himself receded into the background when the works of Hemadri, Candesvara, Madanaratna, the Vtramitrodaya, the Mayūkhas of Nilakantha became popular, Even before the Kamadhenu and probably the Smstimañjari also, Bhoja (about 2nd quarter of 11th century A. D.) composed (or patronised the composition of) several works such as the Bhujabala and Rajamārtanda which exhaustively dealt with the astrological requirements of sainskūras from pursavana to marriage and also of vratas, yatra, śāntis, pratiṣtha (vide the author&rsquo;s paper on &lsquo;King Bhoja and his works on Dharmaśāstra and astrology&rsquo;in JOR, (Madras), vol. XXIII for 1953-54 pp. 94-127 for five works of Bhoja). So there was nothing very novel in the Kftyakalpataru except its exhaustive and logical treatment of all topics and profuse quotations from the Epics and Purāṇas. The Mitakgara does</p>
<p>Works and papers on Puranas</p>
<p>885</p>
<p>not quote much from the Puranas, but Aparārka and Kalpataru quote them profusely. The Kalpataru quotes about 600 verses from Dovipurana, over 200 verses each from Kalika, Aditya purāna, Nandipurāpa and Narasimhapurāṇa (all Upapuranas) while it quotes none at all from Viṣnudbarmottara. The Kalpataru did not probably regard it as authoritative, though Aparārka and the Dānasāgara utilized it to some extent. The learnod editor of the extensive Kalpataru, Prof. Aiyangar, has made great efforts to identify the quotations therein from the Purāṇas, and laid all workers and scholars under great obliga tions. But many quotations have eluded him as will be shown later on. He has been assiduous in pointing out how Hemādri, Candeśvara and Mitramiśra have copied wholesale&rsquo; from the Kalpataru. It is not impossible that even the Kalpataru might have done the same to some extent as regards its predecessors such as the Pārijāta, Prakāśa, Smrtimañjari, and Kamadhenu. But as those works are not yet available, no positive conclusion can be drawn about its borrowing for the present</p>
<p>The present author edited 286 verses from the Rājamārtanda (containing 1462 verses) on tithis, yratas and utgavas in ABORI YOL 36, parts III-IV, 1956, pp. 306-339,). It describes geveral vratas and utgavas like Indradhvajotthapana and the work is about 75 years older than the Kalpataru. The Kalpataru is studiously silent as regards Bhoja, though it mentions Kama dhenu, Govindarāja, Prakāśa and Halāyudha and it hardly any. where mentions the vratas described by the Rājamārkanda. The Mitākṣarā does mention Dhāreśvara Bhoja. Probably Lakṣmidhara did not like that a comparison should be instituted between his treatment of vratas and Bhoja&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Alberuni&rsquo;s work on India translated by Sachau furnishes us with some data about the chronology of Purānas. On p. 130 (of Sachau&rsquo;s tr.) he says he heard the following as the Purāṇas viz. Ādi, Matsya, Kūrma, Varāba, Narasimha, Vamana, Vāyu, Nanda, Skanda, Aditya, Soma, Samba, Brahmānda, Mārkaṇdaya, Tārksya (i.Garuda ), Visṇu, Brahma, Bhavisya. It will be noted that he mixes in this list Purāvas and Upapurāṇas. He further states that he had seen only portions of Matsya, Aditya and Vayu. Then on p. 131 ( of Sachau&rsquo;s tr.) there is another list which was read to him from the Visṇu (viz. the 18 principal Purāṇas, Saiva being substituted for Vāyu ). Then, on p. 229 (of Sachau&rsquo;s tr. ) he sets out from Aditya some details about the regions below the earth and shows how Vāyu differs from it and</p>
<p>888</p>
<p>History of Dharmaśāstra (seo, IV, Ch. xtit</p>
<p>on p. 248 he sets out details about Meru from Viṣnu, Vayu and Aditya. As he wrote his work in 1030 A. D. one has to conclude that Purāpas having the names oited by him existed some time before 1000 A. D. at the latest.</p>
<p>Some of the papers of Prof. Hazra and others on the princi pal Puranas and on some of the Upapurāṇas are brought together in one place by Dr. Pusalkar in his work Studies in Epics and Puriṇas&rsquo; pp. 218–225; a few of them are mentioned here. About sixteen papers of Prof. Hazra contributed to various Journals from time to time were included in his work Studies in Puranik Records of Hindu Rites and customs &lsquo;, which is referred to as PRHR here and H. stands for Prof. Hazra and U. for Upa poripa</p>

<p>Brief Notes on individual Purāṇas and Upapurānas</p>
<p>Agnipurāna- Present Agni&rsquo; (by H.) in L. H. Q. vol Xi pp. 683-691: &lsquo;Studies in genuine Agneya alias Vahnipurāna&rsquo; by H. in Our Heritage' vol. I part 2 pp. 209–245 and vol. II part 1 pp. 76-109; &lsquo;Discovery of genuine Āgneyapurāṇa ' by E. in J. O. L (Baroda ) vol. V (1956) pp. 411-416 ( shows that present Agni published by Anan. Press is not the original Purana, that this was compiled late, while the original Agneya or Vahni is not yet printed ); the Dānasāgara p. 7. verse 63 speaks of an Āgneya which it has discarded apart from one which it has utilized (p. % Vorso 11 ). As usual with most Puriṇas, the printed Agneya glorifies itself by saying (in chap. 272. 13 and 17 ) that in that Mahāpurāṇa Hari resides in the form of diffe rent lores and the Agneya is a great purāṇa full of Veda and all vidyās.</p>
<p>Adipurāna (U.)-B. V. VOL VI (1945 ) pp. 60-73 (H. posta lates an earlier and a later version ). Vāyu 104.7 mentions an Adika among the 18 prinoipal purāṇas (including the Brahma). Alberuni&rsquo;s list (which mixes up Purānas and Upapurānas ) mentions an Adipurāpa; an Adipurāna is published by the Venk. Preas in 29 chapters. H. in Studies &amp;c.&rsquo; vol. I pp. 279-303 deals at longth with this and tries to establish that there was an earlier Adi Purāṇa of which no msg. are yet available (p. 211) and holds that it is to be dated between 1203 to 1525 AD. (&lsquo;Studies&rsquo; p. 288 ). Adi and Adya mean the same thing. But Kullūka on Manu II. 54 quotes some verses from Adi which are asoribed to Brihma by G, R. p. 314. The digests make a con fusion between Adi and Adityapurāṇa. Vide H. in &lsquo;Studies&rsquo; vol I. pp. 302–303. The printed one is a late compilation and none of the verses quoted by Lakṣmidhara and Apararka occur therein (vide' Studies' vol. I pp. 286–289).</p>

Padma (Pātālakhanda 102, 41-42 J14140 expressly names the Kūrma and quotes a verse from it. Kalpataru (on śrāddha p. 119) quotes two verses from it.

Kalpataru on vrata quotes 29 verges from it ( 22 on Ganesacaturthi pp. 84-87 almost all of which are found in the current work, chap. 26. 2-20); Kalpataru on Tirtha quotes 66 verses from it, almost all of which are in chap. 65.2-31, 66. 1-9, 20-45 of the current work; Kalpataru on Niyatakāla quotes 65 verses almost all of which are found in chap. 58; Kalpataru on Mokṣa quotes 57 Verses, which can be traced in chapters 17, 58, 59, 60, 61; the Danakānda of Kalpataru quotes 13 verses ( found in chap. 30. 27 ff. ), and Brahmacārikāṇda quotes four verses; Aparārka quotes about 40 verses from Nṛsimha, of which 16 concern yati (pp. 951, 965 from chap. 60. 12 £.), 17 verses deal (p. 140 ) with arghya to the Sun (from 58. 91-93) by the employ ment of the 16 verses of the Puruṣasūkta for nyāsa on the different parts of the body and also the sixteen (from chap. 62. 5-14) upacaras from āvāhane (invoking to come) to visarjana (bidding adieu) in worship, 5 verses on Narasimba-pūjā with the mantra &lsquo;Om namo Nārāyanaya&rsquo; (63. 3 and 6). Out of 3 verses on p. 125 dealing with evening sandhyā and homa attributed to this Purāṇa two are the same as Dakṣa-smki (II. 28-29). $m. C. quotes 27 verses on Āhnika from Narasimha. It appears that both Kalpataru and Aparārka had a much longer version befora them than the present purāṇa. It may be noted that Kșomaka who was the last king of the Aila-vamsa (acc. to Vāyu 99. 43% and others ), is described in the Narasimha-purana (chap. 23:) as the son of Naravahana and grand-son of the famous anciónt couple -</p>

<p>Nāradapurāṇā-(Venk. Press). Vide H. in I. C. vol. III, p. 477-488, PRHR. pp. 127-133 on &ldquo;Bphan-nāradiya and Nāradiya&rsquo; and &lsquo;Studies &amp;c.&rsquo; vol. I pp. 309-345. The Bphan. nāradiya was published by the Calcutta Asiatic Society and by the Vangavāsi Press in 38 chapters and about 3600 verses. H. bolds that the Brhan-Dāradiya is a purely sectarian Vaisnava work, is wanting in the characteristics of a purāṇa, that the Nāradiya noticed by the Matsya (53. 23 as containing 23000 verses and in which Nārada proclaimed the dharmas of Brhatkalpa) and by the Agni (272, 8) is different from the present Nāradiya and that the extant Nāradiya borrows from the Brban-nāradiya (pp. 336–341 of &lsquo;Studies &amp;c.&rsquo; vol. I). The Nāradiya (Venk, Press) is divided into two parts, the first in 125 chapters and the 2nd in 82 chapters (and about 5513 verses in all). Out of the 5513 verses of the 2nd part 3400 deal with various tirthas and most of the remaining are concerned with the story of Rukmāngada and Mohini, The first part deals with several matters such as praise of Viṣnu and bhakti, Geography of India, story of Sagara, Bhagiratha and Gargā-māhātmya, a few vratas, Varna dharma, Aśramadharma, pātakas, sadācāra and śrāddha. Nāra diya 1. 9.40 has a verse which echoes a Kirātārjuniya verset:17 and proclaims that a brahmana who enters a Bauddha temple even in a great calamity cannot get rid of the sin by hundreds of expiations, since the Bauddhas are heretics and revilers of 1418 Veda. The first part speaks of Vaiśnavāgama (37, 4) and Pancarātra procedure (53,9). The Sm. C. quotes many yerses from the extant Nāradiya on Ekādasi and the story of Mohini. One characteristic passage may be quoted here.1419 Rukmangada proclaimed that any person more than eight years of age and below 80 years who would eat food on the day of Visnu in his kingdom would be liable to corporal punishment, fine or banish ment. Aparārka also (p. 205 ) quotes two verses about fast on</p>

<p>Padmapurāna &ndash;H. in I. C. vol. IV. pp. 73-95, Mr. M. V. Vaidya in Kano presentation vol pp. 530-537 (holds that the tirthayatrā section of Padma is older than the tirthayātrā section in the Mahābhārata), Dr. Belvalkar in F. W. Thomas Festschrift (pp. 19-28) holds that Padma is based on the Mahābhārata: Prof. Lūders tried to prove that the Rṣyaśṛnga legend in Padma is older than the same legend in the Mahābhārata (vide I. E.Q., vol. XX. p. 209 for Lūder&rsquo;s view); H. in PRHR. (pp. 107 129 ) states that there are two recensions of the Padma the North Indian and the South Indian, that the former is in five kāṇdas and the latter in six, that the South Indian recension alone is published in the Ānandāśrama and Venk. Press editions, though the arrangement differs in the two editions. H. in PRHR (p. 126 ) states that the Uttara-kāṇda ( of the Padma ) is later than 900 A. D. and earlier than 1500 A. D. One remarkable fact is that hundreds of verses are common to Matsya and Padma and some writers like Hemādri quote long extracts from the Padma, which others quote from the Matsya. In view of the vast smrti material in the Matsya and the fact that thousands of verses therefrom aro quoted in the medieval nibandhas the present writer is inclined to hold that it is the Padma that is the borrower. There are no materials to assign a definite date for the borrowing, but it is likely that it was before 1000 A. D. Padma (IV. 102. 40-41 and IV. 110, 483) mentions the Kūrma (and a verse is quoted from it) and IV. 5. 32-43 contain such alankāras as Śleṣa and Parisankhyā. The Kalpataru quotes from Padma about 55 verses on vrata, 50 on Diyatakāla, 50 on dana, 1% on tirtha, only a verse here and there on other kāndes. Aparārka quotes only about 12 verses from it, the Smsticandrikā only about 25. In the Anandāśrama edition of Padma there are 48452 verses and 628 chapters. It speaks of the Asvattha as Bodhisattva (Sșstikhanda 55. 16 ) and mentions a place called Vanasthala in Gurjaradeśa (II. 51. 36-37).</p>
<p>Brahmapurana-The one printed at the Ānandāśrama appearg to be a late compilation. Vide H. on &lsquo;Apocryphal Brahmapurāṇa&rsquo; in I. O. II. pp. 235-245 and PRHR pp. 145-157, H. states that numerous quotations from the Brahma occurring in the works of Jimūtavāhana, Aparārka, Ballālasena, Deyanna bhatta and Haradatta are not found in the printed Brahma, that the current Brahma borrows chapters from the Mahabharata, Viṣnu, Vāyu and Markandeya and that the present Brahma.</p>
<p>894</p>
<p>History of Dharmadāstra (Seo. IV, Ch. XXII</p>
<p>was composed between 10th century and 12th century A. D. H. Otto Sobrader states that chapters 236-244 of the present Brahma dealing with Sāṅkhya and Yoga are borrowed from the Mahabharata (L.C. vol. II, pp.592-93). The Dānasāgara refers to two Brahmapuranas one of which it did not utilize (p. 7 verse 63). The Kalpataru quotes at least about 1500 verses from the Brahmapurāpa (600 in niyalakūla section, 66 on tirtha, 60 on mokṣa, 78 on rājadharma, 21 on gṭhastha, 20 on vyavahāra, versos 15 on vrata, 15 on brabmacarin of which the editor has traced only 9 in the printed text). The Kalpataru on śrāddha quotes soveral hundred verses from the Brahma, the number of quotations being larger than the quotations from any other Purana, the next being Vāyu and Matsya. On p. 388 of the śrāddba section the Kalpataru quotes from Brabma-purāna a few verses about showing honour to Buddha and Bauddha monks on a certain tithi. The printed Brabma contains 245 chapters and 13783 verses. Chapters 70-175 deal with various tīrthas in 4640 verses, chapters 28 to 69 dilate upon several tirthas such as Kopāditya, Ekāmra, Avanti, Purusottama-tirtha. The whole purana or at least a section seems to come to an end with chapter 175 and from chapter 176 it is Vasudevamābātmya that is set forth up to chap. 213 and the narrator is Vyasa and not Brahmā as in the chapters up to 175. Many of the verges from chapters 42 onwards are quoted by the Tirthacintamani (e. g. chap. 43. 1-13 in T. C. p. 58–59, chap. 45, 52-89 in T. C. pp. 61-64, chap. 49 in T. C. pp. 65–72). As Vācaspati flourished in the latter half of the 15th century A. D. (vide H of Dh. vol. I. p 405), the first part of the prosent Brahmapurāṇa cannot be placed later than the 13th century A. D. The present Brahma has several verses in common with Brahmānda and Vāyu (vide H. of Dh. vol. IV. p. 388 n 870). It is not unlikely that the other Brahmapurāṇa which Ballālasena discarded is the present Brahmapurāṇa and that both Kalpataru and Ballalasena had an older work of the same name before them. The prosent Brahma was probably compiled in some part through which the Godavari (Gautamı) flows in Dandakāranya; chap. 88. 18. 123. 117 and 129. 55 atate that Daṇdakāranya is the holiest country and that the river Godāvarf flows through it (chap. 129. 62, 66); chap. 88. 22-24 derive Janasthāda on the Gautaml as the sacrificial ground of the kings of the Janaka race.</p>

<p>Ganapati and Kronajanma. It has some chapters on Dharma sastra topios, such as on castes, gifts, vratas, bolls, duties of varpas and aśramas, women. Many of the versog quoted from this Purana in the Sm. C., Hemādri and other writers are not found in the current Purana. Wilson, in the Introduction to the Viṣnu, says (pp. LXV-LXVII) that it has not the slightest title to be called a Purāṇa. Vide H, in A.BORI vol. XIX pp. 75-76 and PRHR pp. 166-167</p>
<p>Brahmānda ( pub, by Venk. Pregs). It is divided into four pādas (I. 1. 33-39) viz. Prakriya (5 chapters ), Anuṣanga (33 chap.), Upodghāta (74 chap.), Upasarhāra (4 chap ) followed by Lalitopakhyāna in 40 chapters. The Kurma expressly 1420 states that the Brahmānda was narrated to the sages engaged in a sattra in the Naimisa forest and the Skanda (Prabhāsa-khanda 2. 8-9 ) states there was formerly only one Purāṇa called Brahmānda containing one hundred crores of verses and that later it was distributed into 18 parts. It was probably composed near the rise of the Godāvarī, since it says that that part of the country towards the northern ranges of the Sabya mountain where the Godāvari rises is the most charming in the whole world and that there a city called Govardhana was foun ded by Rāma. 1421 In the first two parts it deals with the subjects of creation, the geography of the earth and of Bhāratavarṣa, and the manvantaras, pupils of Vyāsa, the distribution of the Veda Sakhās &amp;c. The third section is the longest and after mentioning Vaivasvata Manvantara and, after dilating upon the creation of gods, asuras, gandharvas, sages and their progeny, it deals at length with all aspects of śrāddha ( in chap. 9-20 and 879 verses ), describes Parafurāmā&rsquo;s austerities, his securing of weapons, his , slaughter of Kārtavirya and kṣatriyas, filling five lakos with their blood (in chap. 21-47 and over 1550 verses); then follow in chapters 48-57 the story of Sagara and the bringing down of the Ganges by Bhagiratha, the protection of Gokarna from the sea, and the story of Sūrpāraka (chap. 57 and 58), the dynasties of the solar and lunar race (chap. 598); then it speaks of Dhanvantari receiving from Bhāradvāja Ayurveda in eight angas; in part IV. it refers to Manus, jñāna, karma, mokṣa &amp;c.</p>

<p>The Brahmāṇda is one of the oldest of the 18 Purāṇas and has hundreds of verses in common with the Vāyu. Vide above p. 852. The Mit. on Yaj. quotes a verse from the Brahmānda 1422 stating that a person, on touching Saivas, Pāśupatas, Lokāyatikas and atheists, persons of the three varpas following forbidden paths and śūdras, should bathe with the clothes on. Aparārka quotes about 75 verses from it of which 43 are concerned with śrāddha. The Sm. C. quotes about 50 verses on Ābnika and Srāddha, of which ten occur also in Aparārka The Kalpataru does not quote a single verse from it in the sections on viata, grhastha, tirtha, rājadharma, but quotes 16 verges from it on grāddha, and 16 on mokṣa, none from Niyata, and from Vyavahāra. If we may judge from some of the matters noted here it cannot be placed as early as the Matsya. In ILI. 48.8 and 20 it employs long com pounds, 1923 mentions Bhimasena and Nārada 1424 as writers on music (III. 61, 42-43), contains a chapter (III, 62) on Gāndharya, refers to the opinions of former acāryas, to 30 alankāras of nātya and four purposes of such alavkāras (chap. 62, verse 22). It may be placed between the 4th and 6th century A. D. For discussion on Brahmānda, vide Pargiter in AIHT pp. 23,77 and H. in PRHR (pp. 17–19). The Brahmāṇda is very fond of etymologies; vide for example, those of vaisya and sūdra (II. 7. 157-158 ), of deva, manuṣya-prajā, raksas and yakṣa (II. 8. 9-10, 20, 34), of Tryambaka and Rudra (II, 9. 3-4 and 78), of rājan (in II. 29, 64), of Vasudhā, Medini and Pștbivi (11. 37. 1-3), of Atri, Vasiṣtha, Pulaha and Pulastya (III. 1. 44-46), of Kubora (III. 8. 44-45).</p>
<p>Brhad-dharma-purūna ( U.) - Vide H, in J. of University of Gauhati and &lsquo;Studies &amp;c.&rsquo; vol. I, pp. 115 and 277. It is a work of Bengal of the 13th or 14th century A. D.</p>
<p>Bhaviṣyapurāna &ndash; Accounts of the contents of the Bhavisya in Matsya 53, 30–31, Agni 272. 12 and Nāradiya 1 100 do not tally with the printed Bhavisya (Venk, ed.).

The Bhavisyo ttara is discarded by Ballālasena as unauthoritative, though it was popular in his day (vide. p. 869 above). Apararka quotes 160 verses from Bhavisyottara on danas of various kinds. The Sm.C. (I. p. 203) quotes a single verse from the same. Hence the Bhavisyottara cannot be later than 1000 A.D. The Kalpatara quotes hundreds of versos from Bhavisya on vrata, and many Verses in other kandas,e.g. 55 in brahmacari, 110 on niyata kala, 101 on grhastha, 100 on rajadharma, 15 on sraddha. The Mit. quotes 1425 a single verse from Bhavisya about donating &amp; golden image of a snake when &amp; man is bitten by a snake. Aparārka quotes about 125 verses from Bhavisya, of which about 90 relate to prayascittas&hellip;</p>
<p>One remarkable feature of the extracts from Bhavisya in Aparārka is that they quote the views of Angiras, Gautama, Parā. sara, Manu, Vasiṣtha and Saṅkha. There are several passages quoted by Aparārka from the Bhavisya which approximately indicate the age of the current Bhavisya. 1426 It also refers to sight Vyakaranas in I. 1. 59-61 viz. Brahma, Aindra, Yamya, Raudra, Vayavya, Varuna, Savitra and Vaisnava. But these are different from the well-known eight grammars (except Aindra). It mentions the foreign words Ara (Mars) and Kona (Saturn ) 1427 and states these planets are to be worshipped along with Siva, Parvati, Ganese, the Sun &amp;c. In prescribing a praya soitta for killing &amp; person who is merely a brāhmaṇa by caste the Bhavisya prescribes (as one of the alternatives) the prāyascitta prescribed by Parāśara.1428 .

The Bhavisya mentioned in Vāyu (99. 267 tān sarvān kirtan yiṣyāmi: Bhavisye pathitān nṛpān i tabhyaḥ pare ca ye canye utpatsyante mahikṣitaḥ u) is not the present one but the ancient Bhavisyat mentioned by Ap. Dh. S.(vide p. 817 and n 1328 above). The Varāhapurāṇa expressly mentions Bhavisyat-purāna twice (177.34 and 51 ).1429 The second reference is quite interesting. It appears to say 1429a that the Purāṇa well-known as Bhaviṣya was revised by Samba who then established an image of the Sun,</p>
<p>Bhāgavatapurūna. None of the early works such as the Mit., Aparārka, Kalpataru, the Smṛticandrikā draw upon thig, The Dānasāgara know it, but, as the Bhāgavata did not contain a disquisition on dānas, the author passed it over. Its date is very controversial, ranging from the 5th century A.D. to the 10th. Dr. Pusalkar (in &lsquo;Studies in Epics and Puranas&rsquo; 1953, pp. 214-216) brings together most of the papers on this subject; Shri S. S. Sastri in ABORI vol 14 pp. 241-249 on the two Bhagavatas&rsquo; claims that the Dovibhāgavatapurāṇa is earlier than the Bhagavata, while H. in JOR ( Madras) vol. 21 (pp. 48–79) takes the opposite view, viz. that the Devibhāgavata is much younger than the Bhigavata. In &lsquo;Date of the Bhāgavata-purāna&rsquo; by B. N. Krishna mūrti Sharma in ABORI. vol. 14 pp. 182-218 it is argued that the Bhagavata is as old as the 5th century A. D. and he cites in support certain passages from the Mokṣadharma of the Mahā. bhārata (Kumbhakonam edition), but the critical edition from Poona treats those passages as apocryphal. Prof. Das Gupta in the 4th volume of his &lsquo;Indian Philosophy&rsquo; deals with this Purāṇa, but his views are criticized in JBRS vol. 36 pp. 9-50. Vide H. in NIA vol. I. pp. 522–528. The Padma part VI. (chapter 189–194) contains a Māhālmya of Bhagavatapurāṇa in 518</p>

<p>verson. The author of the Purāṇa is said to be a native of the Tamil country by Mr. M. R. Majumdar in IHQ vol. 8. pp. 49-53. The present writer thinks that it is a late Purana, since even in the Moksakāṇda (of Kalpataru) it is not cited, while about 300 verses are cited from the Viṣnupurāṇa in that kāṇda alone. Vide note 1604 below. No reliable and cogent evidence has been adduced to prove that the current Bhāgayata can be placed earlier than the 9th century A. D.</p>
<p>Matsya purana ( Anandāśrama ed.). It has 291 chapters and 14062 verses. It is one of the ancient Purāpas and has perhaps the largest number of smrti chapters among Purānas. Many Verses of the Manusmrti and the Mahābhārata occur in it. Somo verses of Yāj. also occur in Matsya e. g. Yāj. I. 295 is Matsya 93.2, Yaj. II. 279.295-6 and 303 are the same as Matsya 227.200, 202–203 and 204. It appears that the Matsya holds the balance between Siva and Viṣnu. It glorifies not only Viṣnu in the Mataya avatāra but devotes 1570 verses to the slaughter of Tārakāgura and 623 to the destruction of Tripura, both by Siva. The Vāmanapurāṇa (12. 48) speaks of it as the principal among Purāṇas.</p>

I. 297 expressly quotes all the nine verses of chap. 94 of the Matsya ( about the form of the images of the planets) and two verses from chap. 93 (11-12) about the position to be assigned to each with white grains of rice in a mandala The Kalpataru quotes hundreds of verses from Matsya on vrata, quotes about 750 on dāna from Matsya (all of which except 20 are identified in the present Mataya by the editor); about 410 on Rājadharmakāṇda, 157 verses on tirtha ( of which 100 are identified by the editor in the Matsya), 115 verses in Gphastha kaṇda, 112 Verses on śrāddba, about 67 OD Diyatakāla (all except 12 identified), 18 in vyavahārakānda, 6 in brahmacāri and % in mokṣa, in all about 2000 verses. Apararks quotes about 400 verkos from Matsya ( about 250 being on dana). It is not necessary after the preceding statement to go into the large number of verses quoted in Dānasāgara, Smrti-candrikā and Homādri. It may be said without fear of contradiction that long before 1000 A. D. the Matsya-purāṇa had the same arrange ment and presented almost the same appearance as at present. This is more than what can be said about the other Purapas except Viṣpu, Vayu, probably Bhaviṣya (I), Mārkandeya.</p>
<p>In the prosent author&rsquo;s opinion the Matsya is among the best preserved and the earlieat of the 18 Puranas. It may be</p>

<p>dated between 200 A. D. to 400 A. D. The author does not wish to deny that a few verses here and there might have been inter polated at a later dato.</p>
<p>Vide H. on the dates of the smrti chapters of Mataya in ABORI vol. 17 pp. 1–36 and PRHR pp. 26-52 and Prof. Ram chandra Dikshitar on &lsquo;Matsyapurāna, a study&rsquo; (Madras, 1935, pp. 1-140). Four verses from a Svalpa-matsya-purāna aro quoted in the Pitrdayitā (p. 92) of Aniruddha (about 1160 A. D.) and there is a paper thereon by Shri Manoranjana Shastri in J. G. J. R. I, vol. IX pp. 183-188. Matsya and Padma ( as stated before ) agree verbatim in many chapters on tirthas and vratas. Saṅkarācārya quotes a verse from Paurānikas which is Matsya.1430 Among the sages to whom water is offered in tarpana are included (by Matsya) Kapila, Āsuri, Vodbu and Pancaśikha. The first two and the last are mentioned in the Sāṅkhyakarikā as the three great founders of the sankhya system. Vararuci is said to be a profound scholar of Natya-veda. In chap. 24 the Purana refers to the fact that the Apsaras Urvasi and her friend Citralekha were kidnapped by a demon called Keśin, who was vanquished by Purūravas and Urvasi was released and was given by Indra to Purūravas. While she was acting the part of Lakṣmi in a drama called Lakṣmi-8vayamvara composed by Bharata, she, being engrossed in her passion for Purūravas, forgot the proper abhinaya taught by Bharata and was cursed by Bharata to be a creeper. It is difficult to say whether the Matsya got its inspiration for this story froni the Vikramor vasiya or whether the great poet Kalidāsa was influenced by the story in the Matsya. The story in Matsya and in Kālidāsa&rsquo;s drama agree very closely as regards names and incidents. The Matsya says (24.24) that for vanquishing Keśin Purūravas employed Vāyavya-astra. The drama also mentions it (I.).</p>

<p>The only points of difference are : in the drama Lakṣmi-syayam vara is said to have been composed by Sarasvati, while Matsya does not say so. Besides, the Purāṇa says that Urvasi was cursed by Bharata to be a creeper, while Kālidāsa says nothing of the kind and shows that her being reduced to the condition of a creeper was due to Kumāra ( Kārtikeya ). The decision depends on the exact dating of the Matsya from other evidence. I am in. clined to believe that Kālidāsa was familiar with the episode rela ted in the Matsya. There are scholars who believe that Kalidasa flourished under Vikramāditya about 57 B. C. The present writer does not subscribe to this belief. There is hardly any reliable or positive evidence to show that a powerful ruler called</p>
<p>Vikramaditya ruled Northern and Central India about 57 B.C. The tradition of the pine jewels is of no use and if relied upon would make Vikramāditya rule about the 5th or 6th century A.D., since Amarasimha, Varāhamihira and Kalidasa would be con temporarios. A coin of the Gupta Emperor Candragupta II (Allen&rsquo;s Catalogue of coins, pp. 35 ff.) bas jerar hararea a fabuffet. The present writer believes that the most probable date for Kālidāsa is between 350 to 450 A. D.</p>
<p>Mārkandeya-purāna-Thore are two editions, viz. B. J. edition ( of 1862 ) and the Venk. Press ed. The present author has mainly used the latter for quotations. The two differ slightly</p>
<p>as to the number of verses in almost each chapter e. g. there are 270 verges in chap. 8 of B.J. edition and 287 in Venk, ed.; chapter 16 of the Venk, edition corresponds to chapters 16-18 of the other edition. There are 134 chapters in the Venk, edition and 137 in B. J. edition. Pargiter translated into English the Mārkandeya. In the first 42 chapters (B. J. ed.) Mārkandeya takes hardly any part, but in the remaining chapters he is the principal speaker. This is a peculiar Purāṇa. The first chapter opens with four questions put by Jaimini to Mārkandeya about Mahābhārata saga, viz. (1) why nirguṇa Vāsudeva assumed a human form, (2) how Draupadi became the wife of five brothers, ( 3 ) Balarama performed expiation of brahmahatyā by pilgrimage (and not by his own death), (4) how the five unmarried sops of Draupadi, themselves great warriors, met death helplessly although they had the great Pāndava heroes to protect them. Mārkandeya directs him to go to wise birds in the Vindhya mountain and the answers are given in chapters 4 to 7. One wonders why Jaimini said to be a pupil of Vyāsa in the Purānas did not go to Vyāsa but to Mārkandeya. A portion of this Purāṇa is called</p>

<p>Devimahātmya or Saptasati 1431 (chapters 78-90 of Veók, ed. and 81-93 of B. J. edition) and is deemed by modern Sanskrit scholars to be an interpolation. But even if it is an inter polation it must have been made before the 10th century, as the oldest known ms. of it is dated 998 A.D. and probably before 600 A. D. The Mārkandeya has practically no verses on vrata, pilgrimages or śānti, but dilates on the duties of aśramas, on rājadharma, śrāddha, holls, karmavipāka, sadacāra, yoga, (explained by Dattatreya to Alarka ), stories of Kartavirya, bis grandson Kuvalayāśva and of Madālasā, creation, manvantaras, geography &amp;c. It has bardly any sectarian bias; prayers and invocations are few except in the Davimāhātmya. The present Purāpa has, as indicated above, three different and disconnected sections viz. chapters 1-42 (Vonk, ed.), where the wise birds figure as speakers, chapters 43 to end where Mārkandeya and Kroṣtuki, a disciple, carry on the discourse, except in Devl. māhātmya, which is the third and an independent section.</p>
<p>The Kalpataru on mokṣa quotes about 120 verses from Mārkandeya on yoga. almost all of which are found in the printed text. It quotes on brahmacārikānda 9 verses, 1% on srāddha, 17 on niyatakāla, 19 on gphastha, 3 on rājadharma and one on vyavahāra. Aparārka quotes about 85 verses froun the Mārkandeya of which 42 are on yoga and the rest on śrāddha, giving alms, hospitality, suddhi &amp;o. The Sm. C. quotes 15 Verses from Mārkandeya on āhnika, 40 verses on śrāddha. Mārkandeya quotes several verses from Manu and Mahābhārata. Markandeya contains some long drawn out rūpakas as in 3.59-70(where prajña is said to be a fort-wall and the soul as king therein) and 35. 8-13 (ahamityankurotpannaḥ &amp;c.). It contains the popular idea that for married women long stay with their relativos (in the family of birth) does not conduce to good reputation and that the desire of her relatives (by blood) is that a married woman should stay in her husband&rsquo;s house. 1932 The Mārkandeya says that the root of all</p>

The verse HEMATA cited above on p. 176 D. 4548 (from laterra) is quoted in the Dadhimati-mātā inscription (found in the Jodbpar State) dated 289 of the Gupta era (E. I. vol. XI p. 299 at 303 ).

On the other hand, this Purāna narrates the story of Datta 1434 or Dattatreye who imparted instruction on yoga to Alarka (from chap. 16 ff), but who is represented as an avatāra of Viṣṇu givon to drinking intoxicants, as fond of the company of women, as staying near a water reservoir constructed with wood and stones on the Sabya ( 16. 132 ) and is called Avadhūta ( 17. 3). In chap. 54 it is said (just as in Brahmānda oited above p. 895) that the country in the north ranges of Sahya and near the Godāvari is the most charming in the world</p>
<p>On the whole this is one of the early parūpas and may be assigned to a date between the 4th to 6th century A. D.</p>
<p>Lingapurāna (Venk, ed.). It has 11000 verses as stated in chap. II. 5. The Kalpataru on tirtha quotes about one thousand Verses from it on Avimuktaka (Banaras) and the sub-tīrshas therein, Aparārka quotes six versos from it on Sivapājā on the 8th and 14th tithis and bath and śrāddba in selipses. The Smr. C. quotes a few versos from it on bath in eolipses, Veda study &amp; According to the Dānasāgara (p. 7 verse 64) there was another Lingapurana of 6000 verses which it had not utilized Vide H. in I.

It is remarkable that Vyāga does not appear in the Purāṇa, though the Sūta figures at the beginning of soveral chapters (e. g. chap. 1, 2, 39, 50, 127, 137-138, 148, 151, 181, 213). It deals with most of the general topics of Dharma śāstra such as yrata, tirtha, dāna, images and their worship, āśauca, śrāddha, karmavipāka, narakas, cosmology and geo graphy, prāyaścitta &amp;c. The Kalpataru quotes 150 verses from it on vrata (most of which are traced by the editor), 40 verses on śrāddha (none of which is traced), 250 verses on tirtha (many of which are traced), 17 on niyatakāla (half traced), five on dāna (all traced), 4 in grhasthakāṇda (not traced). One peculiarity is that it mentions some tirthas like Lohārgala and Stutasyāmi which are not described in other Purāṇas. Aparārka quotes about 55 verses from it on several topics.</p>
<p>The Brahmapurāṇa 1433 refers to a Vārāha text laying down a srāddha for pitrs on the Full Moon when the sun is in Virgo. The Bhavisyottara also (32. 12) refers to Varābayacana. For the priority of the Bhavisya to Varāha vide above p. 898. Varaba refers to a saka prince called Nandavardhana (in chap. 122. 34) and verse 56 refers to a saka king.</p>
<p>Vide H. in ABORI vol. 18 pp. 321-337. It is difficult to assign a date to the Varāhapurāṇa. It is not one of the early Purāṇas. In any event it is earlier than the 10th century A.D.</p>
<p>Vāmanapurūna (Vonk, ed.). It is a short purāna as com pared with Matsya, Vāyu, Varāba &amp;c. It has 5451 verses in the Venk, ed. There is prose in chapters 26, 44 and 93. For its size it contains many legends, such as Saṅkara cutting off a head of Brahma, the story of Prablāda and his grandson Bali and the latter&rsquo;s downfall, the greatness of Devi and her exploits, marriage of Siva and Umā at the request of gods, the birth of Kārtikeya and explanation of his various names, the story of Danda who was cursed by Sukra for rape, enmity between Vasistha and Viśvāmitra, Gajendramokṣa &amp;c. It briefly deals with many of the usual dharmaśāstra subjects viz. tirtha, sadācāra, āśramadharma, sāmāngadharma, vrata, karmavipāka &amp;c. The Kalpataru quotes from Vamana about 88 verses on tirtha (only some of which have been traced), about 80 verses</p>

<p>· The Vamana-purāṇa mentions Kāmaśāstras in 91.73 and Mangalavāra (Tuesday) in 41. 24. It has been stated above p. 899 that it expressly mentions Matsya as the best among Purānas. The story of king Danda (in 63. 19 f.) who perished along with the kingdom because he tried to violate Sukra&rsquo;s daughter appears to be an echo from Kautilya&rsquo;s Arthaśāstra (I. 6 p. 11 &lsquo;Dāṇdakyonāma Bhojaḥ kamāt brāhmaṇakanyām abhi. manyamānaḥ sabandhurāṣtro pinanāsa.). It states that the king is called rājan because he keeps the subjects contented, just as Kālidāsa sayg. 1437 It says that Umā was so called because 1458 she was forbidden to practise &lsquo;tapas&rsquo; in the words *u nā&rsquo; and that Sive assumed the form of a Vedic student carry ing a staff of Aṣādha (Palasa) and wearing a girdle of Muñja grags. This also appears like an echo of Kumārasambhava V.</p>
<p>The Sm.c. I. p. 168 quotes the two verses in which the Vāmana prescribes that a man after a bath and homa should leave his house (for businoss &amp;c.) after touching certain objects deemed to be auspicious (noted below).</p>
<p>Taking all these matters into consideration the Vamana purāpa would have to be placed between 600 to 900 A. D. Vide H. in IHQ XI. pp. 115-130 and PRHR pp. 76–92.</p>

<p>Vayupurāna (Anandasrama ed.). This has 112 chapters and 10991 verses. It appears to have been divided like the Brahmānda into four pādas, Prakrivā (chap. 1-6), Anuṣangs (chap. 7-64), Upodghāts (65-99 ) and Upasamhāra (100-11%). In the first chap., the first verse is the famous one &lsquo;Narayanam namaskrtya&rsquo; and the 2nd eulogises Vyāsa ( both those are not found in several mss.). The third verse refers to bhakti for Śiva Chap. 104 is not found in many mss. and the chapters at the end on Gayāmāhātmya are deemed to be later additions by some scholars. There is Saiva bias in several chapters such as chap. 20. 31-35 (with &amp; prose passage containing Vedic texts). 24. 91-165 (called Sarvastotra), chap. 55 (Sivastuti put in the mouth of Visnu), chap. 101. 215-330. Probably to counter balance this the chapters on Gaya were added and also the praise of Yiṣpu in chap. 98 where Dattatreya, Vyāda, Kalkin are said to be avatāras of Viṣnu, but Buddha is not mentioned. Chapter 99 is the longest one in the Purāọa, contains 464 verses and is full of legendary material and historical references. There are several verses in the Purāṇa that appear also in the Mahābhārata, Manu and Matsya. For its relation to Brabmanda vide pp. 85, 896 above. This Purā pa, like the Matsya, contains much Dharmaśāstra material. It is one of the oldest and most authoritative Purānas, though it contains some later additions.</p>
<p>The Vāyu is not quoted in the prata and niyatakala seo tions of the Kalpataru, but it is largely quoted in several other sections. From the Vāyupurāṇa Kalpataru quotes about 160 verses on śrāddha 1439 (of which the editor identified only about 21), about 35 on mokṣa (most traced), 22 on tirtha, 7 on dana, 5 in brahmacāri and 5 in grhastha. Aparārka quotes about 75 verses from Vāgu out of which 60 concern śrāddha and the rest deal with fast, dravyasuddhi, dāna, sapnyaga and yoga. The Sm. C. quotes only about 24 verses from Vāyu on brāddha, on atithi, on Agnihotra and fuel-sticks.</p>

<p>Parāśara (son of Vasiṣtha), which he received from Sarasvata, who received it from king Purukutsa on the Narmada, who heard it from Dakṣa and others who learnt it from Brahmi.</p>
<p>Five out of the seven verses of Brahmānda III. 68. 97-103 are the same as Viṣnu IV. 10. 23-27 (about what Yayāti said about tronā). The same occur in Brahma-purāṇa 12. 40–46. It is likely that all borrow from the Mahābhārata, Adiparva 75. 44 f, 85. 9 ff. and Anuśāsana 7.21 ff. The Mit. on Yājāavalkya II. 6 quotes on Nārāyaṇabali about 14 verses of the Viṣnu. parāṇa. The Kalpataru on Moksa quotes 250 verses from the Vispu (most of which have been identified), 70 op niyatakāla (almost all traced), 21 on brahmacāri, 28 on śrāddha (only one not traced), 21 on tirtha (all traced), about 45 on gļhastha kanda.1441 Aparārka cites about 75 verses from the Viṣnupurāpa and the Smrticandrikā about 100. The Kāvyaprakasa 1441 (IV.) quotes two verses from this (V. 13. 21-22 about a gopakanyā attaining final release by her thorough unswerving devotion to Lord Krspa). The Vispupurāṇa teaches in some places the sublime philosophy of advaita;1442 for example, it says &lsquo;He who seeks mokṣa should strive for treating all as equal, gods, men, boasta, birds, trees and creeping life are all the form of the Infinite Viṣnu, though appearing as distinct from each other; one who realizes this should look upon the world as his own self &amp;c.&rsquo; In another place the Viṣnupurāna 1143 states The mind alone is the cause of the bondage of men and their release; mind that is attached to the objects of the senses tends to bondage, but when it is beyond attachment to them, it tends to moksa&rsquo;, It teaches the central doctrine of the Gitā that actions done without an eye to the reward or fruit thereof do not lead to bondage, 1414</p>

<p>The date of the Viṣnupurāna is a difficult question. There is no doubt that it is one of the early Purāṇas and that its text is not very much inflated. Hundreds of verses quoted in the three early digests viz. Kalpataru, Aparārka and smrticandrikā can be traced in the current text and this leads to the inference that the text has remained fixed for at least a thousand years, One important fact is that in this Parāṇa Vyasa and the Sūta do not play a prominent part as in many other Purāṇas. It states as some other Purāṇas do, that Vyāsa had four pupils to whom he imparted the four Vedas and a fifth pupil the Sūta Romaharsana (III. chapters 3-7). But the sūta does not appear anywhere as the narrator of this Purāṇa. In the 4th am a one remarkable matter is the mention of Sākya, Suddhodana and Rāhula and it is stated that Suddhodana was 23rd in descent from Bṛbad-bala of the Ikṣvāku line (chap. 22). The possibility of interpolations, particularly in the prose passages, would have to be admitted. Rāśis are referred to in III. 14.5 (rāśiṣvarke oa gacchati) and the words lagna and horā also appear (in a prosto passage). Vācaspati in his commentary on the Yogabhāsy&amp; 2. 32 quotes it by name on yamas and niyamas (Viṣnu VI. 7. 36-38 ) and a half yerse &lsquo;evam bhadrāsanādinām&rsquo; eto., Vispa VI. 7. 49 in com. on Yogabhāsya III. 49. Vācaspati wrote his Nyāyagūcinibandha in vatsara 888 which should be taken as Vikrama year as he was a northerner and as the word &lsquo;vatsara&rsquo; is used ( and not saka) i. . 841 A. D.</p>

<p>date of Viṣnupurāpa&rsquo; in ABORI Vol. 18 pp. 265-275 and PRHR pp. 19-26 (puts if between 100-350 A. D.); Prof. Dikshitar in Pro. of the 13th Indian History Congress pp. 46-50; Jos.

<p>Viṣnudhar mottara (U. pub. by Venk. Press). It is a huge work and has been dealt with above (pp. 876-878). In spite of its huge size it is not quoted by the Kalpataru on yrata, tirtha, brahmacari, grhastha, rājadharma, mokṣa and other kāpdas. Aparārka quotes only 30 verses from it, of which 24 are on dāna: the Smrticandrika quotes about 30 in all and that Danasāgara quotes profusely from it on dana. It cannot be earlier than 600 A D., and cannot be placed later than the 10th century, though parts of it may be later additions. Chapters 52-65 of the first section are called SaṅkaragItā. The Kālikā Purana expressly refers (in chap. 91. 70 and 92. 2) to the Visnudharmottara as having been concerned with Rājaniti and Sadācāra.</p>

I. pp. 32-108. This purina is hardly ever quoted by early digests such as the Kalpataru, Aparārka or Smṛticandrikā. Only four verses from it are quoted by the Dānasagara. Prof. Hazra&rsquo;s propositions that the Bhavisya (pp. 68-82) and Brahmapurāṇa (prosent) borrow from the Samba are not at all acceptable to the present author, parti cularly in view of his own admission (in &lsquo;Studies &amp;o. vol. I, p. 68 ) that the present Sāmbapurāṇa consists of different units belonging to different climes and ages. All that can be said positively is that a purāṇa called Samba is mentioned by Alberuni in 1030 A. D. (Sachau I. p. 130 ).</p>

Dr, Pusalkar in Studies in Epics and Puranag pp. 31-41 (holds that the printed Vāyu is a genuine Mahāpurāpa, that the Sivapurāṇa is a late work and is only an Upapurāna); the oldest datable reference to it is in Alberugi&rsquo;s work (vide Sachau, vol. 1. p. 131). It is quoted in the Danasāgara several times, but is not quoted in Kalpataru, Aparārka and Sm. O. It is divided into seven sambitās called Vidyasyara, Rudragamhita (in five parts called Sșsti, Sati, Pāryati, 1444a Kumāra, Yuddha ).</p>

<p>śkanda &ndash; This is the most extensive of Purānas and pogos perplexing problems. It is found in two forms, one being divided into seven khandas, viz. Maheśvara, Vaiṣpava, Brahma, Kāśī, Āvantya, Nāgara and Prabhāga, the other being divided into six samhitās, viz. Sanatkumāra, Sūta, Sārkarl, Vaiṣpavi, Brāhmi and Saura. The Skanda in seven khandas has been published by the Venk, Press and the Sūtāsambitā with the commentary of Mādhavācārya has been published by the Anan. Prese, Poona. The extent of the Skanda is variously given as 81000 slokas, at 100000 slokas (vide PRHR p. 158), at 86000 (in PRHR p. 159). The god Skanda does not figure prominently in this Purāṇa named after him. The Skanda is named in the Padma V. 59. 2. Skanda I. 2. 6. 79 is almost in the same words as Kirātārjuniya 1415 (II. 30 sahasa vidadhita na kriyām). Skanda, Kāśikhanda 24 ( 8 ff) is full of Sloṣa and Parisankhya in the style of Bana as in &lsquo;yatra kṣa</p>

<p>papakā eva drøyante maladhāriṇaḥ&rsquo; (verse 21) or &lsquo;vibhramo yatra nāriṣu na vidvatsu oa karbicit&rsquo; (verge 9). Natyaveda and Artha gāstras are mentioned in Kāśikhanda (Pūrvārdha 7. 4-5), Dhan vantari and Caraka on medioine are mentioned in Kāśikhanda (Pārvārdha 1.71); the word Jhotinga occurs in Kāśikhanda 72.74 (Jhotingā rākṣasāḥ krūrāḥ). Skanda is quoted on topics of Dharmaśāstra in early commentaries and digests. The Mit on Yaj. 11. 290 mentions it in connection with the status of veśyās (courtozans). Kalpataru on vrata quotes only 15 vorges from it, Kalpataru on tirtha (pp. 36-39, 32, 46, 130-135 ) quotes 92 verses from it, on dāna only 44, on niyatakāla 63 verses, 18 verses on Rājadharma (on Kaumudimahotsava), only 4 in śrāddhakanda and 3 in gļhasthakāṇda. Aparārka 1446 quotes only 19 verses from it; one quotation indicates Tantrik</p>
<p>influence (vide note). The Dānasāgara cites 48 verses on dana from it and the Sm. O. only 23 in all. Considering the colossal figure of slokas in the Skanda it must be said that it is rather sparingly quoted in the Dharmaśāstra works. A verse in it seems to echo the very words of Kālidāsa and quotes the view of Dovala.14460 In such a huge work interpolations could easily be made. So it is difficult to assign a definite date to it. A ms. of the Skanda in the Nepal Durbar Library is written in charac tors which belong to the 7th century A. D. according to Haraprasad Shastri (vide Cat, of Nepal Palm-leaf mass. p. LII.)</p>
<p>It would be not far from the truth to say that the Skanda cannot be placed earlier than the 7th century A. D. and not later than 9th century A, D, on the evidence so far available.</p>

<p>Influence of Purāṇas on Dharmasastra</p>
<p>Literary works and society act and re-act on each other. The state of Indian society &amp; few centuries before and after Christ, riven as it was by the growing strength and onslaught of Buddhism, Jainism and other dissenting sects and disturbed by invasions of the Greeks, Sakas, Pahlavas, Hūpas and other foreign tribes, gave much food for thought to those who were devoted to the Vedic religion and induced them to write works setting forth new ideologies and practices and effecting a re statement of the ancient Vedic and Smrti religion. When these works attained a position of authority and eminence, the endea vour of the followers of the Veda was to follow them as far as possible and to adapt their practices and religious rites to the requirements of the Purāṇas. We have to see how the Purāṇas Bet about their task of re-orientation. We must note that current Hindu religious practices, judging from the sankalpa made at the beginning of every rite, are meant to confer upon the per former the rewards declared by Śruti (Veda), Smrti and Purāpas (Sruti-smrti-purāpokta-phalaprāptyartham). The task was two fold, viz. (1) to undermine the power and prestige of Buddhism and Jainism and the influence of the numerous philosophical 1447 schools that had sprung up and (2) to wean away large sections of the masses from the attractive features of Buddhism and to convince them that they could secure in the re-orientated Hindu faith the same benefits, social and spiritual, as Buddhism promised and that the religious principles of the followers of Veda coincided with many of the teachings of Buddhism and were borrowed by Buddhism from Vedic practices. Ultimately Buddhism vanished from the land of its origin. The main causes of this disappearance of Buddhism from Bhārata will be stated at the end of this section, but this much may be said here at once that the Purāpas played a substantial role in bring</p>

<p>ing about the decline and disappearance of Buddhism by emphasizing and assimilating some of the principles and doctrines of Buddha 1448 such as ahiṁsā, by accepting Buddha himself as an avatāra of Viṣnu, by adopting vegetarianism as a high form of austerity, by making use of monasteries and asceticism as stated in such smṛtis as those of Magu and Yāj.</p>
<p>The Purānas set about their task by saying that for the proper understanding of the Veda, knowledge of Itihāga and Purāṇa was essential. A famous verse says 1449 &lsquo;one should strongthen the Veda by (the study and application of) Itihāsa and Purāṇa; the Veda is afraid of the person of little learning (with the thought) that he (the man of small learning) may harm it&rsquo;. Manu states 1450 that those brāhmaṇas that have learnt according to the rules (of Veda study) the Veda together with the works that strengthen it are to be understood as sistas and are instrumental in making (the meaning of) the Veda clearly perceptible. The Vayu 1451 emphasizes in this connection that that brāhmaṇa who knows the four Vedas together with (the six ) ancillary lores and the Upaniṣads would not be a wise man if he did not know Purāṇas. The Upaniṣads drop brief hints about the creation of ākāśa from the one brahma (in Tai. Up. II, 1), of tejas (Chān. Up. VI. 2. 3), of waters (Chān. Up. VI. 2.4).

<p>Naciketas that ocour in the Ait. Br. and the Kathopadiṣad are explained at length in Brahmapurāṇa (chap. 104 and 150 about Hariscandra), in Sabhāparva chap. 12 (for Hariscandra) and in Anuśāsana chap. 91 (for Naciketas). The famous dialogue of Yama and Yami (Rg. X. 10) is expanded in the Narasimha purāpa (chap. 13. 6-36). The Viṣnupurāṇa 1452 (IV. 6. 34 ff) sets out the story of Purūravas and Urvaśī, refers to the hymn in the Rg. X. 95 for that story and quotes the first verse of the hymn in a somewhat corrupt form.</p>
<p>But the claims of the extant Purāṇas go far beyond the above viz. as strengtheners of the Veda. The Kūrma 1453 states: &lsquo;(put) on one side all the Purānas together with Itihasa (Maha bhārata) and on another the highest Veda; it is this (Puranas) that surpasses (the other viz. Veda)&rsquo;. The Mahābhārata also makes a similar claim. The Purāpas appear to claim priority (and even equality ) with the Veda. In note 1349 passages from the Matsya and other Purāṇas have been cited, stating that Brahma first thought of the Purāpas before all other śāstras and then the Vedas sprang forth from his lips. Several Purāṇas ara spoken of as equal to the Veda (Vedasammita) as in 1154 Vāyu I. 11, 4. 12, Brahma 1. 29, 245, 4 and 21, Viṣnu I. 1. 13, VI. 8.1%, Padma VI. 282. 116. Further, several Purāṇas claim to have been delivered by some God such as Brahma (Brahmapurāṇa I. 30) or by the Wind-god (Vāyu I. 196 )1455 or by the avatāras of Viśṇu as in the case of Matsya-purāṇa (I. 26 ) or Varāha (2. 1 3). The japa of Vedic texts was deemed to destroy all sins as shown in H. of Dh. vol. IV. pp. 45-50. The Purāṇas also say that reading the Purāpas or listening to a recitation of them</p>

Some of the Puriṇas indulge in extravagant praise of themselves, e.g. the Varāha-purana ( 217. 12-13, 217.15-16) states that reading ten chaptors of that Purāna confers the merit secured by the performance of Agnistoma and Atirātra sacrifices. Vide Brahma 254, 34-35, Agni 384. 13-30, Devi-Bhāgavata XII. 13. 11-17 in a similar strain. Moreover, the Purāṇas dwell upon the superior value and officacy, as compared with the Vedic sacrifices, of some of the institutions on which they lay emphasis, such as pilgrimages,1357 yratas, bhakti. The Padma states (I. 38.2 and 18) that by merely going to Gayā or by taking a bath in the Phalgu river one secures the reward that the performance of Aśvamedha confers. The Skanda proclaimg 1-458 &lsquo;I have no use for sacrificial rites that are declared by the Veda, that have no life in them, that are within the domain of ignorance and that ontail injury (to animals). If (a sacrifice) is performed with such inanimate things as fuel-sticks, flowers and kusa grass, the result must be similar (inanimate), since the effect is like the cause&rsquo;. Vide Santiparva 337 for a story on the discussion between sages and gods about offering in sacrifices merely pro ducts of grains or goat-flesh. Offerings of flesh in sacrifices to gods were made in the Rgvedic period. But even in the Rgveda there are a few verses that indicate that offerings of gheo and fuel-sticks were declared to be able to win the favour of gods as much as animal sacrifices might do. Whoever 1159 offers to (or worships) Agni with a fuel-stick or with an oblation of ghee or</p>

<p>The Purāpas only pursue an attitude to Veda and sacrifices that is found in some of the Upaniṣads. The Mundakopaniṣad1461 says: &lsquo;one should know two vidyās (lores ), parā (the higher) and apara (the lower); the latter comprehends the four Vedas and Phonetics, aphorisms about solemn saorifices, grammar, Nirukta (derivation of words), metres, astronomy; while the highest lore is that whereby the Imperishable (Reality) is known&rsquo;. The same Upaniṣad condemns aparā-vidyā when it says &ldquo;These sacrifices are infirm (leaky ) boats constituted by eighteen ( persons) depending on which are declared actions that are inferior; those foolish people who welcome these actions as the highest good become subject again to old age and death&rsquo;. The Kathopaniṣad 1462 states that what are known as avidya and vidyā are far apart from each other, are contradictory and lead to different results. When Nārada approached Sanatkumāra and requested the latter to teach him, the latter said to him &lsquo;tell me what you know and then I shall tell you what is beyond that.&rsquo; Then Nārada stated that he know all the four Vedas, Itihasa-purāṇa the fifth Veda and several other loros, whereupon Sanat-kumāra told him that the four Vedas and the other lores he had learned were merely a name and then he led Nārada gradually to the understanding of the Highest Self. The Bṛ. Up. I, 4, 10 condemns him, who worships &amp; deity thinking he is different from the devatā, that he does not know the truth, that he is like &amp; ( sacrificial) animal to the gods.

<p>History of Dharmadāstra (Soc. V, Ch. XXIV</p>
<p>several passages of the Upaniṣads austerities, liberality, straight forwardness, ahimsā and truthfulness are put forward as equal to or superior to the actual performance of the ceremonial of sacrifice (yajna); vide Chāndogya III. 17. 4, Praśna I. 15, Muṇdaka I. 2. 11.</p>
<p>Though in a few passages of the Upaniṣads the knowledge of the Highest Self is put higher than the four Vedas, the Upa niṣads generally treat the Vedas as authoritative and quote Vedic verses in support of their statements. For example, the</p>
<p>Ait. Up. II. 5 quotes Rgveda IV, 27. 1 (taduktam-sșiṇā-Garbhe : nu &amp;c.), Praśnop. I. 11 quotes Rg. I. 164, 12 (pañcapadam</p>
<p>pitaram), Bș. Up. II. 5. 15, 17 and 19 quote respectively Rg. I. 116. 12, I. 117. 22, VI. 47.18 (rūpam rūpam pratirūpo). The Upaniṣads further emphasize 1463 that brahmavidyā is to be imparted only to those who are śrotriya ( who have studied the Veda), who engage in their duties and who bave properly per formed Sirovrata. The Bp. 1464 Up. shows that Veda study, sacrifices, charity &amp;c. are preparations for the knowledge of brahma: &lsquo;Brāhmaṇas (and others ) desire to know this ( great Self) by study of the Veda, by sacrifices, gifts, tapas, fasting&rsquo;. These passages make it clear that study of the Veda and per formance of sacrifices enjoined by it are accepted by the Upa niṣads as preparatory and as cleansing the mind of its lower passions and as making a person worthy of receiving the know ledge of the highest truth about the One Supreme Spirit and that the Upaniṣads do not altogether condemn and give up the Vodas and sacrifices,</p>
<p>The Puranas adopt, in spite of the claims made by them here and there about their priority to the Vedas, about their own value and efficacy, the same attitude towards the Veda as the Upaniṣads do. They treat the Vedas as authoritative and enjoin</p>

<p>the employment of Vedic mantras in many rites. The author contributed a paper to the Dr. Kunhan Raja Presentation volume pp. 5-8 on the Vedic mantras and legends employed in Purāṇas&rsquo; citing illustrations from the Brahmapurāṇa. A few illustrations from other Purānas may be set out here. The Matayapurāṇa (chap. 93) when describing the procedure of the homa to the nine planets prescribes nine Vedic mantras, five of which are different from those provided by Yāj. (I. 300-301). Vide p. 750 above for a comparative table of the two sets of mantras. In the Udvahatattva 1465 Raghunandana remarks that the mantras &lsquo;ā krspeda&rsquo; and others are common to persons following the four Vedas and that Bhavadevabhatta held the same view. Matsya prescribes that when inauspicious birds (like an owl) or animals cry near a house or enter it, a homa should be performed, or five brāhmaṇas should engage in a japa 1466 of the hymn beginning with &lsquo;Duvāḥ kapota&rsquo;(Rg. X. 165. 1-5). In describing the whole procedure of the establishment of images of gods or the linga (of Siva), the Matsya (chapter 265 ) prescribes numerous Vedic verses and hymna for the different parts of the ceremony. For example, for bringing about the purification of the image four mantras are presoribed viz. Rg. VII49. 1-3 and X. 9.1; in providing for the placing of a jar full of water near the head of the bed on which the image is to be placed, two mantras Āpo devi&rsquo; (Vāj. S. 12.35, Tai. S. IV. 2.32 ) andāpo asmān mātarah&rsquo; (Rg. X. 17.10 ) are to be recited. Matsya ( 265.24–29) prescribes for the japa of several sūktas (hymns) by four door-keepers learned in the Vedas that are to stand in the four main direo tions. The Agnipurāṇa (41.6-8) providing for the laying down of baked brick or stones in building a temple proscribes the Tecital of many Vedic mantras, viz. Kg. X. 9.1-3, Rg. X. 9.4, Rg. IX. 58. 1-4, Pāvamāni veraes (either Rg. IX. 1. 1-10 or verses from Rg. IX), Rg. I. 24. 15, Rg. IV. 31. 1, Vāj. S. IV. 36 (Varupasya), Rg. IV. 40.5 and the Srīgākta (of 29 Verses</p>

<p>The Purānas not only prescribe Vedic mantras for various purposes, but suggest the employment of numerous Paurāṇika mantras. It appears that Paurāpika mantras came to be employed along with Vedic mantras in religious rites even of Brāhmaṇas at the beginning of the Christian era or within &amp; few centuries after Christ. Yāj. I, 229 prescribes that the Visve Deyas should be invited to come to a sraddha with the çk, &lsquo;O Visve-Devas! Come, listen to this my call, sit down on these kuśas&rsquo; (Rg. II, 41. 13). On this the Mitākṣarā (about 1100 A. D.) remarks that along with the Vedic mantra mentioned by Yāj. &amp; smārta mantra should also be employed viz. the mantra1467 &lsquo;āgacobantu mahābhāgā,&rsquo; which occurs in Skanda and Garuda purāpa. Vide H. of Dh. vol. IV. p. 440 note 984 for the ascrip tion of this verse to various authorities. The Vayupurāṇa 1468 prescribes that the mantra' adoration to the devatūs, to pits, to the great Yogins, to stadha and svāhā; they are always present' should be recited thrice at the beginning and at the end of brāddha and at the time of offering pindus; the pitļa quiokly come when the mantra is repeated and goblins run away; this mantra protects the pitrs in all three worlds'. This mantra is styled &ldquo;Saptārcis' (having seven flames) in Vāyu 74. 20, Brah mānda 111. 11. 30 and in Visṇudharmottara I, 140. 68 and by Hemādri on śrāddha pp. 1079 and 1208, who notes that it occurs in seven Puranas. In chap. 206 of the Agni in the procedure of offering arghya to the star Agastya (Canopus) Rg. I 179. 6 has been adopted as verse 13.</p>

<p>gār</p>
<p>Not only are mantras from Vedic Samhitay prescribed by the Purāṇas for certain rites, but Upaniṣad passages also some times with slight variance are bodily transferred into some of the Purānas. For example, Kūrma II. 9. 12, 13 and 18 embody Tai. Up. II. 4 (yato vāco nivartante ), Syetāśvataropa, III, 8 (vedāham-etam puruṣam) and VI. 11 eko devaḥ'. The Vigpu purāṇa VI. 5. 65 is &lsquo;dve vidye veditavye iti catharyani śrutih&rsquo; and contains a passage of the Mundaka Up. 1.1.4 (vide note 1461 above). The Vāyu 20.5 (prapavo dhanuḥ) and 20.28 (Ajām ekām) are respectively Mupdakopa. II, 2.4 and Svetāśvatara-up. IV. 5. Vāyu 14. 13 (sarvataḥ pāṇipādāntam) is almost the same as Svetaśyatara Up. III. 16 and Vāmana 47, 64-65 has the same verse. Vamana 47.67 is almost the game as Rg. I. 10.1.</p>
<p>This gives rise to interesting questions. The sūdras had no right to study the Veda. But as a matter of fact the Purānas contain as exemplified above a good many Vedic mantras. It is stated in the Bhāgavata 14682 women, sūdras and brāhmaṇas in name only are beyond the pale of the three Vedas; therefore the sage (Vyāsa) composed through compassion for them the Bharata tale'. The Devibhagavata states &lsquo;study of the Voda</p>

<p>is not accepted for women, tūdras and brahmanas in name only and Puranas are compiled for the purpose of benefitting them&rsquo;. From this it follows that in the case of gūdras the listening to the Bharata was deemed to bring about the same results that the Veda does for drijas and that even the sūdra may acquire the knowledge of the Self (and mokṣa) from the Bharata.</p>
<p>Though the brāhmapas in the 5th and following centuries A. D. wanted to placate the sūdras who were probably a majority of the whole people and to wean them away from Buddhism, they still kept a distinction between dvijas and sūdras and the only concessions made wore that the sūdras could worship in the same way as dvijas did and that they could have mantras (Paurāṇika) in their rites and ceremonies. For example, in allowing bhasma-snāna (smoaring ashes on the body ) the Padma (IV. 110. 236-289) provides Vedic mantras for men of the three varnas but Paurāṇika mantras only (Padma IV. 110. 290-293) for sūdras. The Padma 1469 further provides that sūdras could not perform prāṇāyāma or utter the sacred syllable &lsquo;om&rsquo; but that they should substitute dhyāna in place of prāṇāyāma and &lsquo;Siva&rsquo; in place of &lsquo;om&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Gradually in some matters the procedure provided in the Purāpas came to supersede the ancient Vodic procedure pre scribed for them. Aparārka states (on p. 14) that in Devapūjā one should follow the procedure prescribed in the Narasimha purāna 1470 and the like and not the procedure of the Pasupatas or Pancarātras and (on p. 15) he says the same about the con secration of temples, 1471 images and the like,</p>
<p>The Narasimhapurāṇa (chap. 63.5-6) says that the mantra *om namo Nārāyaṇāya&rsquo; enables one to secure all objects and japa of it frees a man from all sing and leads him to absorption into Viṣnu.1972</p>

<p>The Agnipurāṇa (chap, 818) destribes the procedure of the king&rsquo;s coronation and (chapter 219) sets out the Pauranika mantras (about 70) employed at the coronation. Similarly, the Vigṇudharmottara (II. 21) describes the procedure of coronation with Vedic mantras and (in II. 22 ) with 184 Paurānika Verses invoking various gods, minor deities, sages, rivers &amp;o. Medieval digests like the Rājanitiprakāśa (pp. 49–83), Nītimayūkha (pp. 1-4), Rājadharmakaustubha (pp. 318-363) describe the combined coronation procedure of Vedic and Paurāpika mantras from the Visnu-dharmottara (vide pp. 78-79 of the H. of Dh, vol. III. for details). The Rājanitiprakāśa (pp. 430-433) prescribes numerous mantras derived from the Visaudharmottara as prayers and as blessings.</p>
<p>The Padmapurāṇa 1473 narrates the interesting story of a person called Dhanaśarmā whose father followed only the Vedic path (śrauta-raārga), who did not engage in such Paurāṇika prescriptions as Vaiśākhasnāna and who therefore became a horrible and distressed preta. Some of the verses are very inter esting. &lsquo;I performed in my ignorance only Vedic rites and I never observed Vaisakhasnāna in honour of God Madhava (Vispu), nor observed a single Vaiśākha Full Moon vrata which is like an axe for cutting the tree of sins that afflicts one like a conflagration fed by the fuel of sinful deeds &amp;c.; to one who studies many śāstras and several Vedas with their extensive ancillary Literature, learning does not come, if he has not studied Purānas&rsquo;. This shows what importance came to be attached to Purāṇas not only for sūdras but even for brāhmaṇas who performed the Vedic rites prescribed for them.</p>
<p>The influence of the Puranas went on increasing gradually. At first it was said 1194 that the dharma understood from the Veda was the highest, while the dharma declared in the Purānas</p>

This gradually changed and dharma was said to be of three kinds, Vaidika, Tantrika and Mista and it was said in the Bhagavata 1475 and the Padma that one may worship god Vispu in any one of the three ways that one desired. The Padma adds that the Vaidika and Miśraka methods are declared to be proper for brāhmanas and the like, while the Tantrika method of worship is meant for a devotee of Viṣnu and also for sūdras. The Devibhāgavata (XI. 1.21–23) states that Sruti (Veda) and Smrti are the eyes of dharma and Purāna its heart, and that that is dharma which is declared by these three and that dharma oan be found nowhere else than in these, that in Purāpas sometimes what is found in Tantras is put forward &amp;8 dharma, but one should not accept that.</p>

<p>Vyāsa composed Bhārata for all varnas</p>
<p>925</p>
<p>declared by Parāśara&rsquo;s son (Vyasa); the compassionate Vyasa composed a śāstra for the benefit of all four Varnas in which he comprehended the entire meaning of the Veda and the Dharmen sāstras; it is an unparalleled boat for all that are engulfed in samsāra. This makes it clear that the Purāṇas, the Mahābhā. rata and the Rāmāyaṇa embody pristine traditions and thoughts: and were deemed to have been composed as the instruments of the education and enlightenment of the common people. As &amp; matter of fact we find that some Purāṇas like Agni, Matsya, Viṣnudharmottara are encyclopaedio and include treatises on politics and government, on law, medicine, astronomy, astro logy, poetry, music, soulpture &amp;o. They illustrate India&rsquo;s life and character as a country and exemplify Bharata&rsquo;s achievements, weaknesses and shortcomings. Two questions that arise are: (1) could the Pusāpas including the Vedic mantras quoted therein be read by the sūdras themselves; (%) supposing that Vedic mantras could not be read by the sūdras, could they, it&rsquo; they were able to do so, by themselves read the purāṇas without a brāhmana&rsquo;s help. All writers of digests and commentarios were agreed that sūdras could not read or listen to the Vedic mantras contained in the Purānas (which being meant for the benefit of all yarpas contained Vedic mantras also), but only those that belonged to the three upper classes. Some writers, however, were agreeable to sūdras reciting Paurāṇika mantras in religious rites, relying on a passage of the Padmapurāṇa. But others like Kamalakarabhatta, author of the Nirnayasindhu and Sūdrakamalakara, held relying on verses of the Bhavisya that Paurāṇika mantras alone were to be used by a brāhmaṇa in a, religious rite for a sūdra, that the sūdra was only to listen to the reading of a purāna by a brahmana reader. There was a third view held by Sridatta and others that a sūdra could recite a paurāṇika mantra, but he should not himself read the Puranas and should only listen to the reading of Purāṇas by a brāhmane In the times of the Dharmasūtras the only mantras employed were mostly Vedic and therefore in the case of sūdras Gautama 1477 provided that the sūdras were allowed the alter native of saying &lsquo;namaḥ&rsquo; in place of a Vedic mantra. In the centuries preceding Christ the sūdras would naturally have been attracted to Buddha&rsquo;s teaching as it was addressed to all including śūdras. Comparatively early orthodox writers like</p>

<p>Kumārila know that the sūdras formed the largest number of professed Buddhists when he says 1478 &lsquo;the dicta of Sakya and others were all opposed, except a fow relating to self-restraint, charity and the like, to all the fourteen gources of learning, were promulgated by Buddha and others that bad strayed from the path of the three Vedas and did acts contrary (to the Veda) and that those dicta were presented by them to those who were deluded, who were outside the pale of the three Vedas, who mostly comprised the 4th varna (i. e. sudra) and those that had lost caste&rsquo;. Therefore, the learned brāhmaṇas who wanted to wean sections of the masses (including śūdras) away from Buddhist teachings composed now Paurāṇika mantras by the thousand and employed them in all religious rites like śrāddhas, vratas &amp;c. It was, therefore, that earlier nibandha writers like Śridatta were prepared to allow sūdras to recite Paurāṇika 1479 mantras. But when centuries had elapsed after Buddhism had disappeared from India, orthodox brābmana writers like Kamalakara1180 (who wrote his N. S. in 1612 A.D.) showed a stiffer attitude by confining śūdras merely to the listening to Purāṇas read by a brāhmaṇa and by not allowing them even to recite a Paurāṇika mantra. It may be noted that the Nara simhapurāṇa in laying down the duties of sūdras provides that they should listen to the reading of purāṇas by a brābmapa</p>

<p>Relation of Bruti, Smrti and Purūnas</p>
<p>(reader) and should worship Narasimha (avatara of Visnu), The relation of Sruti, smrti and Puranas and their spheros of application are summed up in the Naradiyapurāṇa as follows: &ldquo;The Veda exists in different forms; there is the Veda which has the performance of sacrificial rites (as its sphere); smrtis ara the Veda for the householder&rsquo;s stage; both those are centered in (or supported by) the Puranas. Just as this wonderful world sprang from the ancient Being (God), there is no doubt that all this literature arose from the Purāṇag. I hold that the meaning (or purpose) of the Purāṇas is more extensive (or superior to) than the meaning (or purpose) of the Veda. All the Vedai always rest on the Purāṇas; the Veda is afraid of the man of little learning (with the thought that) that man may harm it. The Veda does not deal with the movements of the planeta, nor does it contain correct calculations about the proper times ( for religious acts), nor does it deal with the tithivrddhi or tithikaya, nor with the determination of the partans (amāvāsya, pūrnima &amp;c.) or eclipses. Determinations about these were formerly made in Itihāsa and Purāṇas. What is not seen in the Vedas is all noticed in the Smstis; what is nog geen in both is declared in the Puranas. What is declared by the Vedas and what is declared by the auxiliary lores &ndash; it is Voda that is declared by Smśtis and Purāpas. The person who looks upon Puranas in any other light would be born as a lower animal&rsquo;, 1481 The Nāradiyapurāṇa 1492 further states &lsquo;the merit acquired by those wicked men who speak about Purāṇas as arthavādas (more laudatory 1183 or condemnatory statements) are destroyed and</p>

<p>the wicked man who regards as arthavādas the Puranas that are the means of uprooting ( the evil effects of) all acta, reaches Hell&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The Purāṇas introduced several striking changes in the religious rites, practices and ideals of the people. The most characteristic thought and the keynote of the Purānas ia to declare how great rewards and results could be secured with little effort. The Visnupurāṇa (VI. 2) narrates how sages approached Vyāga with the question in what age does a little ilharma yield very great rewards&rsquo;? Vyāsa was bathing in the Ganges; he came out, uttered &lsquo;sūdra is good and Kali is good&rsquo; and then again plunged into the river; then he again came out and said &lsquo;well done, O Śūdra! you are blessed&rsquo;; he again plunged into the river, came out and said &lsquo;women are good and blessed; who is more blessed than they&rsquo;. When he finished his bath and performed his morning rites, the sages asked him to explain what he meant by calling Kali, sūdras and women good and blessed. He replied: &lsquo;a man secures in a sipgle day and night in Kali age as much reward of lapus, celibacy and japa as is obtained in ten years in Krta age, in one year in Tretā and in a month in Dyāpara; therefore, I spoke of Kali as good; in Kali age a man secures merely by the glorification or incessant repetition of the name of Keśava what he would secure by deep meditation in Kṛta, by sacrifices in Tretā, and by worship in Dvāpara; I am pleased with Kali because a man secures great eminence of dharma with a little effort. Persons of the three higher varnas have to study the Vedas after observing many atrict rules, then they have to perform sacrifices which require wealth; they incur sin if they do not perform their duties properly; they cannot eat and drink as they please, but are dependent on the observance of many rules as to food &amp;o.; dvijas secure higher worlds after great trouble; the sūdra secures his worlds by serving the thres Varnas, he has the right to offer the pākayajñas (without mantras) and therefore he is more blessed than a dvija. He has not to observe strict rules about proper and disallowed food or drink and therefore he wag</p>

<p>declared &lsquo;good&rsquo; by me. A woman by serving her husband in thought, word, and deed secures with legs trouble the same worlds that her husband secures with great effort and trouble and therefore I said a third time about women that they were blessed. The acquistion of dharma is secured with small trouble in Kali age by men who wash off all their sins by the water in the form of the qualities of their soul; sūdras do the same by being intent on service to dvijas and women also secure the Bame without trouble by service to their husbands. Therefore all these three are regarded by me as most blessed. &lsquo;1984 The Brahmapurana chapter 229 verses 62-80 are identical with Visnu purana VI. 2. 15-30 and 34-36. The Visnupurana emphasizes that each one must do one&rsquo;s duty in the society in which one is born or one&rsquo;s duty which one has undertaken, that, if a person does this, he reaches the game higher worlds, whether he be a brāhmana or a gūdra. This doctrine is the same as taught in the Bhagavadgita 185 18.45 and 46 &lsquo;a person secures the highest perfection (final emancipation) by being intent on carrying out the duties appropriate to him; man secures perfection (or bllag) by worshipping with the performance of his peculiar duties ( not with flowers and the like or by words) Him from whom all beings proceed and by whom all this (world) is enveloped&rsquo;. Ancient works like the Vedas, Jaimini&rsquo;s sutras on Mimānsā and the Vedantagutras did not consider or discuss how women or sūdras were to secure higher spiritual life and final Beatitude. The Vedantasutra (I 3. 34-38) denies to the sūdra the right to study the Veda and the Upaniṣads. Buddha&rsquo;s teaching held out the same promise of liberation from suffering</p>

<p>to all men irrespective of class or oaste and was therefore most attractive to sūdras. The Bhagavadgitā and the Puranas changed the whole outlook of Indian society, high or low, and promised the same higher spiritual life or worlds to all who dia their work under a senge of social duty, did not hanker after mundane rewards and brought all their actions, in whatever avocation they might be ongaged, as an offering to God. In the Padmapurāpa 1486 Vyāsa is made to say to Yudhisthira: &ldquo;It is not possible to observe in the Kali age the rules of Dharma laid down by Manu and by the Vedas; the one thing which one should do is to observe a fast on Ekādasi in both fortnights (of a month ), which is an easy means (that) requires little wealth, that entails little trouble, but yields great rewards, that is the very essence (of the teachings) of all Purāṇas; he should be pure and on Dyādasi after worshipping Keśava with flowers be should first feed brāhmanas and then himself take his meal; those who desire to secure heaven should perform this vrata throughout their lives; even persons of evil conduct, the greatest sinners devoid of dharma, do not go to Yama ( do not fall into hell) if they fast on Ekādasi.&rdquo; The Sūtasarhitā states &lsquo;effort for acquiring true knowledge (of the Self) is meant for all (for persons even lower than śūdras), that effort made by explaining in a different language (than Sanskrit) and by the lapse of enough time will tend to the good ( of the lowest). This clearly shows how the Purāṇas put before all people easy ways whereby they could attain bliss in the Hereafter,</p>
<p>The Baud.1487 Dh. S., Manu and Vasistha emphasize that one should not invite a large company of brāhmaṇas at a srāddha, because a large company destroys these five (advan tages) viz. showing proper respect to invitees, propriety of place and time, cleanliness and the securing of worthy brāhmaṇas and</p>

<p>Puranas discarded certain rules of Bharata</p>

<p>It was further provided by the Anusagana-parva 1488 and others that one should not go deep into examining the learning, family and character of brāhmaṇas in a rite for the gods, but in rites for the Manog close examination as to these matters is proper (or justified). The Purānas went against both those prescrip tions. They are not tired of recommending again and again profuse expense in grāddhas and condemaning stinginess (lit. roguishness in spending money) in śrāddhas and also in such other matters as the observances of Ekādasi. For example, the Visṇupurāna 1989 quotes nine verses (III. 14. 22-30) as uttered by the pitrs, two of which may be translated here &lsquo;Would that &amp; wise and blessed person be born in our family who not indulg ing in stinginess in spending wealth will offer pindas to us and who would donate to brāhmanas for our sake jewels, clothes, a large conveyance, wealth and all enjoyments if he has riches&rsquo;! Padma 1490 recommends that avoiding stinginoss brings pleasure to the pitys. The Matsya (56. 11) prescribes that one should not show stinginess in the Kļspāstamiyrata. The Padma says that that bad man who being possessed of wealth celebrates the jāgara on Ekādaśī in a close-fisted way loses his soul. The Brahmapurāna 1491 says in a general way that whoever does a religious act with stinginess is a sinner.</p>
<p>Manu (III. 149) provides that &lsquo;in rites in honour of gods one who knows dharma should not oritically examine the brāhmapas to be invited for dinner, but in a rite for ancestors one should carefully investigate the fitness of) brāhmadas&rsquo;. This does not mean that in rites for gods any one may be invited. We have to observe the general rule of Manu (II. 128) that donors should give only to a man who has studied the Veda</p>

<p>dinger in rites for gods or pitra. So what Manu III. 149 means is that deep investigation of ancestry &amp;o, is not necessary in rites for gods,</p>
<p>It is provided by the Vayu 1492 that there is to be no exami. nation of the qualities and character of the brāhmaṇas at Gayā, and the Varāhapurāṇa provides that all brāhmanas of Mathurā are like gods and that a brāhmana of Mathurā not knowing even a k verse is superior to a brāhmaṇa of another place that has atudied the four Vedas. Vide H. of Dh. vol. IV. pp. 579, 670 for details of Gaya and Mathurā brāhmanas. The Padmapurāṇa and the Skands (Kāśikhanda 6.56-57 ) recommend that at tirthas (Sacred places) one should not engage in investigation of the worth) of brāhmapas, and that Manu declares that brāhmanas appearing (at a tirtha) and desiring food should be fed. 1993</p>
<p>It is not unlikely that the above passages from the Vayu, Varāba and Padma are later interpolations. When Buddhism was flourishing large companies of Buddhist monks were fod by the people. When Buddhism declined and disappeared from India after the 12th or 13th century A. D. people came to believe that there was great merit in feeding poor brāhmaṇas just as in former times people fed monks and the Puranas might have only echoed and emphasized the general sentiments of the people. If the people in general had not come to believe in this, the author feels that no amount of interpolations or insistence by the so called crafty brāhmaṇas would have been effective, Writers, Western or Indian, that, relying on the notions current in the 19th and 20th centuries, pass severe and unmeasured strictures on the provisions for brāhmaṇas in the Purānas do great injustice to the authors of Purāṇas that flourished about a thousand years ago or more. Such writers should compare Indian medieval conditions, ideas and doings of brahmanas with the claims of the Popes, Christian priests, Inquisitions and the state of monastic Orders in Europe from about the 10th century A. D. to the 15th century. In comparison it would be</p>

<p>The Purāṇas institute a comparison between solemn Vedic Haorifices on the one hand and pilgrimages and baths at sacred places on the other. The Vanaparva 1495 contrasts the two 29 follows, &quot; the solemn saorificos promulgated by the sages cannot be accomplished by a poor man; sacrifices require many imple. ments and a collection of various materials, which are secured by kings or sometimes by rich men, but not by poor men who have to rely on themselves alone, who have no helpers and who do not possess means. Going to holy places conters merit and Burpasses sacrifices. One does not secure that reward by such sacrifices as Agniṣtoma, in which profuse fees are distributed, which is secured by repairing to sacred places. Vide H. of Dh. vol. IV pp. 561–564 for further encomiums of sacred places and the virtues to be cultivated for reaping the full merit of pilgrimages,</p>

<p>First dāna. High eulogies of gifts have been sung from the Rgveda downwards. The subject of dāna (gifts) in all its aspects has been dealt with in the H. of Dh. vol. II, pp. 837-888, The Mahābhārata in numerous places (particularly in the whole of Anuśāsana-parva) and the Purānas such as Matsya chap. 82 92 and 274–289, Agni chap. 208–213, Varaha 99-111, Padma V. 21. 81-213 (which agree almost verbatim with Matsya 83-92), Padma II, 39-40 and 94, III, 24, Kūrma II. 26 devote a great deal of space to the subject of dānns. But here only two topics in relation to gifts will be dealt with, viz. .gifts of food and gifts to brāhmaṇas. The Rgveda condemns the person as merely a sinful one who does not offer food to the gods nor to his friends and uses it only to fill his own belly, 1199 The Ait. Br. and the Tai.1999 Br, speak of food&rsquo; asprāna&rsquo;(life). The Baud. 1500 Dh. S. states&rdquo; all beings depend on food, the Veda says &lsquo;food is life,&rsquo; therefore food should be given to others), food is the highest offering&rdquo;. Manu 1501 and Viṣṇu Dh. S. state the man who cooks food only for his own sake (and not for offering to gods and mon) eats merely sin&rsquo;. The Bhagavadgitā carries the same message those who eat food loft after offering in sacrifice are frood from all sids, but those who cook food for their sake alone eat sin'. The Padma has a fine passage &lsquo;those who always feed the cripple, the blind, children, old men, persons that are dis</p>

<p>ogsed, helpless and pinched by penury, always enjoy bliss in heaven; there is no end to the merit (accumulated) by con structing wells and tanks, where aquatio animals and others moving on land drink water when they desire, for water is the life of living beings and life is centred in water. The distribu tion of food particularly to learned brāhmaṇas is highly praised in Brahma-parāpa 1502 218. 10-32, Padma V. 19. 289-307m, agai 211. 44-46. The gift of food is superior to all gifts; food is the Tife of men, from food spring all beings; the worlds are depen dent on food, therefore food is praised; man secures heaven by the gift of food; a person who joyfully gives food acquired by just means to brāhmaṇas deeply learned in the Veda ia released from all sids&rsquo; says Brahma. The Agnipurāṇa says &ldquo;The gifts of elephants, horses, chariots, male and female slaves and houses do not come up even to a sixteenth part of the gift of food (in merit); a person who committing &amp; great sin afterwards distributes food becomes free from all sins and secures everlast ing worlds' (211. 44-46). The Kūrma 1503 prescribes a man should give to a brahmavārin (Vedic student) food every day (i. e. when he comes begging); thereby he becomes free from all sins and reaches the abode of Brahma'. Similarly, Padma oalls upon house-holders to give as much cooked food to ascetics as would fill the begging bowl From very ancient times a house holder was called upon to perform five Yajñas ( sacrifices) daily, two of which were Balıharana and honouring a guest (Mazu III, 70) and he was to place food on the ground for persons who had lost caste, who suffered from loathsome diseases, to dāṇdālas, dogs, crows and even insects 1504 (Āp. Dh. S. II. 4. 9.5, Mam III. 92). Vide H. of Dh. vol. II, pp. 745-747 on Vaiśvadoya and Baliharana.

<p>History of Dharmasastra [ Seo. V, Ch. XXIV</p>
<p>men from each other, one Supreme Light poryades and illumi. nates the meanest of creatures and makes the whole world kin. This spirit of a householder to regard it as his duty to offor food to all needy persons and particularly to poor and deserving students and brāhmaṇas has prevailed almost to the present day, though during the last few years shortage of food, high prices and rationing have undermined it a great deal.</p>
<p>Then as to gifts to brāhmanas. In the first place, it must be remembered that all brāhmapas were not priests and are not priests in modern timos. Similarly, all priests in all Indian temples and shrines are not brāhmaṇas. Temple priests are comparatively a later institution and in olden times they were looked down upon and are regarded as inferior brāhmaṇas oven in modern times. Manu (III. 152) states that a devalaka (a brāhmaṇa who performed for remuneration service before the image in a temple) was unfit to be invited at a śrāddha or to officiate in a sacrifice to gods, if he continuously served for three years in that capacity. The ideal set before brāhmaṇas from Yery ancient times was of poverty, of plain living and high thinking, of abandoning the active pursuit of riches, of devotion to the study of the Veda and śāstras, of cherishing a high culture and of handing down literature and cultural outlook. Smrtis like Yāj. I, 213 recommend that even if a brābmaṇa be fit for receiving a religious gift he should refuse gifts and thereby he-secures the same worlds that habitual donors secure. It was for preserving such high ideals among brāhmaṇas that Yaj. I. 333 prescribes that a king should make gifts of cows, gold and land and should bestow on learned brāhmaṇas houses and requisites for marriage (maidens, expenses of marriages &amp;c.). Vide H. of Dh. VOL. II. Pp. 856-858 where references are given to inscriptions containing donations to brābmanas of houses and marriage expenses. In these days every body talks of the high culture and literary traditions of ancient India. But who cultivated the vast Vedic and other Sanskrit literature, presoryad it and propagated it for several millenia? The answer would have to be that it was mostly due to some of the brahınanas who stuck to the ancient ideal for thousands of years. If the Rgveda can be put forward in these days as the most ancient of the literary monuments in any Aryan language, who preserved its more than ten thousand verses with unparallelled care by oral transmission without hardly any variant readings. The reply will again have to be that the brābmanas did it by a</p>
<p>Self-denial by many brahmanas</p>
<p>937</p>
<p>self-denying ordinance. The Brābmanas had to study the Veda with auxiliary lores without 1505 an eye to any ulterior motive, but simply as a duty and to understand the meaning thereof, they were to teach the Veda and other lores without demanding beforehand a fee, they had to bring up their own families, per form sacrifices and make gifts themselves. The only substantial Bources of income were officiating at sacrifices and religious rites and receiving gifts. These sources must always have been variable, fitful and precarious. The brāhmaṇas had no power to tax people as in the case of tithes in the West. Nor had they a regularly paid hierarchy of deacons, priests, bishops and archbishops as in the Anglican Church Therefore, the brahmanas are advised to approach the king or a rich person for their livelihood (vide Gautama IX.63 &lsquo;Yogakṣemārtham-Isvaram adhigaccet). It should be noted that before Buddhism spread far and wide the sūtras and smstis emphasized that religious gifts should be made only to a worthy brāhmana, learned and well-conducted. For example, Āpastamba 1506 prescribes &lsquo;one should invite for dinner in all religious acts brāhmaṇas that are pure, that have studied the Veda and that one should distribute gifts at a proper time and place, ori occasions of purificatory rites and when there is a worthy recipient.&rsquo; To the same effect are Vas. Dh. S. III. 8, VI. 30, Manu (III. 128, 132, IV, 31), Yaj. (1. 201), Daksa (IL. 26 and 31). Not every brāhmaṇa was in those ancient times a proper recipient for a gift, but he had to possess qualities of what is called &lsquo;pātra&rsquo;. A few definitions of pātra may with advantage be cited here. The Anugāgar parva 1507 has a long passage emphasizing the qualities of deserving brāhmaṇa : &lsquo;gifts made to good brāhmaṇas that are free from anger, that are intent on dharma, are devoted to truth and self</p>

<p>control yield great rewards; the sages regard that brahmana as pātra who studies the four Vedas with their argas (auxiliary lores like phonetics, grammar &amp;o.), who is active in doing six acts (viz, abstaining from wine and meat, observing the bounds of morality, purity, study of the Veda, sacrifices, making gifts). Even a single eminent brāhmaṇa endowed with intellect, Vedic learning, good conduot and character saves the whole family; one should bring from afar a brāhmaṇa on hearing that he is possessed of good qualities and is approved by good men and should welcome him and honour him in all ways&rsquo;. Yaj. furni shes 1506 a brief but striking definition of a worthy brāhmaṇa not by Vedic learning alone nor by tapas (austere life) alone worthiness arises; that person is declared to be pātra (worthy recipient for a religious gift) where both these (i. e. Vedic learning and tapas) and good conduct exist. Manu provides that religious gifts given to a brāhmaṇa who has not studied the Veda or who is avaricious or deceitful are fruitlegs and lead the donor to hell (IV. 192-194). The Bhagavadgitā also (17.22) condemns &amp; gift given to an unworthy person as tāmasa ( affected by tamas, arising from ignorance or delusion).</p>
<p>As Buddhism grow in popularity and secured algo royal support, the brāhmaṇas had to tackle several tasks. They had to keep the number of brāhmaṇas at a high level, they had to find maintenance for those devoted to the deep study of the Veda and they had to make accommodation with provalent Buddhist thoughts by assimilating as many of them as possible in their owa writings. Every brāhmaṇa could not possess the memory, the intelligence and the persistent endeavour for long years required for memorizing and mastering even his own Voda and its subsidiary Literature. If one bundred brāhmaṇa families were patronized, hardly ten percent of them could have been masters of their own Veda, but there was always the possibility that those who were not themselves good Vedic scholars might have sons, some of whom might turn out to be profound students of the Voda. Therefore, the number of brāhmapas was to be increased and they had to be fed and not to be allowed to fritter away energy and time in working for their bread. It is mainly due to these factors that some of the Purīnas contain incassant end frantic appeals for gifts to brahmanas,</p>

</ol>
<p>At the time when most of the Puriṇas were composed, the brāhmaṇas were hemmed in by great dificulties and hostile forces. From about the 3rd century B.O. to the 7th century A. D. Buddhism enjoyed royal patronage under such great kings as Asoka, Kaniska and Harga. Buddhism was not really a revolt against caste, but against the sacrificial system, against the Veda and its authority to show the way to salvation, Buddha did not found a new religion, but he was a great re former of Hinduism. He laid sole stress on moral effort, ahinsa, satya &amp;c. which had already been integrated into Hinduism and were part of it and which continue to this day to be part of Hinduism. Buddha in his first sermon in the deer-park near Banaras preached that one who renounced the world should shun two extremes 1509 viz. the pursuit of pleasures and the practice of useless austerities, that it is the course discovered by him that led to wisdom and nirvāna. He expounded the four noble Axioms or Truths (Aryasatyāni) viz. suffering ( duḥkha), the cause of suffering 1510 viz. tanha i.e. traṇā (duḥkha-samudaya), the suppression of suffering ( duḥkha-nirodha), and the way that leads to the suppression of suffering (duḥkha-nirodhagamini patipada). This last is the Noble Eight-fold path (agtangiko 1514</p>

<p>History of Dharmatõstra (Seo. V, C., XXIV mārgaḥ) viz. right views, right thoughts or aspirations, right speech, right actions, right living, right exertion, right recollec tion (or mindfulness), right meditation (i.e. briefly leading a virtuous life). These doctrines preached to all by the noble Buddha and his disciples were attractive as remarked by Rhys Davida, 1511 particularly to the śūdras whose social position was low in the Vedic times and also in the days of the smṛtis. No one could study the Veda in the presence of a śūdra, a sūdra could not parform sacrifices and had to serve the three higher varnas in very ancient times. Almost the same position was assigned to him by Manu (VIII. 413) viz. that he was created by God for serving the brāhmana, though it is doubtful whether this could be or was enforced. Vide H. of Dn. vol. II, pp. 33-36 and pp. 154-164 for the position and disabilities of śūdras from the Vedic times up to the days of the Smortis. It should not, however, be supposed that all India had become Buddhist. Millions still remained Hindus. There was the danger and fear that with royal patron age and the attractive features of Buddha&rsquo;s teachings large masses might forsake their ancient faith.</p>
<p>The brāhmaṇas of the times when Buddhism was at its peak had to strive to keep the banner of the Vedic religion flying, to deprive Buddhism of its bold on the masses of the people and even on the intelligentsia and to make them stick to the old fold. Buddhism itself had changed a great deal in its ideals, dootrinos sometime before the beginning of the Christian era and for centuries thereafter. Buddha&rsquo;s original doctrines were aimed at individual effort and salvation of the individual by his own effort and self-culture. Early Buddhist texts deny the existence of anything like a soul 1512 and find no place for</p>

Buddba pat forth deliberately the doctrine of a galva. tion to be found here in this life in a laward change of beart to be brought about by perseverance in a mere system of self.culture and of self control.

The Seandarādanda (B. I. ed. 16. 28–29 ) says: &lsquo;attu Patlatargul fara गच्छति नान्तरिक्षम् । विर्शन कोचिद्विविशं न कांचित् स्नेहक्षयाकेवलमेति शान्तिम् । एवं कती</p>

<p>Early Buddhist texts find no place for God</p>
<p>941</p>
<p>the idea of God. Though Buddha spoke of Nirvana he did not clearly define it nor does he specify the condition of the indivi dual when he enters nirvāṇa. Aśvaghoṣa compares nirvana to the extinction of a flame (Saundarananda, chap. XVI, 28-29). Bocanse the doctrine of karma was deeply rooted in the popular mind at the time of Buddha, Buddhism took over that dootrine, which, to men who are not Buddhists, appears to be contradio tory of the denial of the existence of a soul. The word &lsquo;Dhamma&rsquo; is used in three senses in the Pāli Dhammapada&rsquo; (which being mentioned in the questions of Milinda is earlier than the 2nd century B. C.) viz. (1) the truth or law preached by Buddha, (2) thing or form, (3) way or mode of life.</p>
<p>As stated above, the original Buddhism preached by the Buddha and his followers in the first century or two after his parinirvana was more or less a strict ethical code for individuals who sought salvation from the misery of the world. The three central conceptions of very early Buddhism wore the three refuges (or rainas ) Buddha, Dharma and Sangha, the Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Path. Gradually a new doctrine was evolved.1513 It came to be thought that to care for one&rsquo;s own deliverance and spend all efforts thereon was rather selfish, that as the Buddha himself out of compassion for suffering humanity worked for forty-five years to lead men to salvation by his exhortations and sermons, so a Buddhist should prefer tor put off his own deliverance, should work for the deliverance of his fellowmen out of compassion (karuna) for their miserable lot and in doing so should be ready to be born again and again, should not care for his own salvation and should not be afraid of satnsāra. Those holding these latter views deified Buddha, taught that Buddhahood was attained by Siddhārtha after under going numerous births in doing service and rendering help to others and that this was a superior code of conduct (Mahāyāna, the Great Vehicle or Way) to the selfish code of salvation for an individual himself ( which came to be called Hinayāna, the leggor Vehicle or Way). This extra-regarding gospel of Mahāyāna was very attractive and won great support in most countries of Asia, 151,</p>

It-sing&rsquo;s Records of the Buddhist religion translated by Dr. J. Takakasa (Oxford, 1896) surprisingly enough states (p. 15) &lsquo;These two systems are perfectly accord with the noble doctrine, Both equally conform to truth and lead us to Nirvana&rsquo;, Baddha at least ignored (if he did not positively deny) God, be denied the individual soul and Eternity, be did not emphasize the most vital Upa nigad teaching viz. ' anando brabmeti vyajāgāt&rsquo;. He imagined salvation as &amp; state of absolate quiescence and therefore regarded ordinary life as misery and asserted that salvation may be attained even in this very life. He did not claim to be God, but a buman being. There are various kinds of Mahāyāna doctrines and great diversity of definitions. It may generally be said that works professing to teach Mahāyāaa practically forsake the ideal of a human Buddha, preach the worsbip of Buddha and fatore Buddhas, and assert that Nirvana cannot be attained by the ancient method, that salvation cannot come in this very life but after centuries and acons of the practice of virtas and helping others.</p>
<p>Mantrayāna and Vajrayana are said by some to be branches of Maba gina, about the latter of which a good deal will be said in the next section. According to Bhikṣu Rabula Sāṅktyāyada, Vajrayana ( 700-1200 A.D. ) is 2 synonym of Mabāyāna (400–700 A. D.) and werely the ulterior dopalope ment of it (vide p. 211 of the paper ‘L' Origine du Vajrayina ot Laa 84 Siddhar' io J. A. vol. 225 (1934) pp. 209-230.</p>
<p>Original doctrines of Buddha</p>

<p>life 1515 itself. Buddha&rsquo;s original teaching regarded it ag &amp; Waste of time to ponder over such questions as &lsquo;Have I existed during the ages that are past or have I not? Shall I exist during the ages of the future? Do I after all exist or am I not?&rsquo; The Sabbāgavasutta (9-13) says that a wise man walking in the noble eightfold path understands what things ought to be con sidered and what things ought not to be considered. Vide 8.B.E. VOL XI, pp. 298-300. Buddhism brought half of Asia under ito influence not only by its promise of salvation to all by self-help, but more so by its teachings of profound tenderness, of active charity, of goodness and gentlenesa. Mahāyāna laid great stress on doing good to all and on bhakti. Both the original teaching of Hinayāna and the Mabāyāna teaching are attractive in their own way.</p>
<p>Buddhism insisted on the five silas 1516 that were binding on all Buddhists viz. prohibition of injury to and destruotion of life, of theft, of sexual impurity, of lying and of intoxioating liquors. Five more precepts ( which together with the preceding five were called Daśaśiksāpadas) were added for Buddhist priests, viz. prohibition of eating at forbidden hours, of attending wordly amusements such as dancing, song, music and shows, of the use of unguents and ornaments, of the use of a large or ornamented couch and of the receiving of gold and silver. About the silas it is clear that they were adopted from the ancient Upaniṣadio and Dharmasūtra teachings. The Chandogya narrates how Aśvapati, king of Kekaya, boasted before five great householders and theologiang&rsquo;in my 1517 kingdom there ia no thief, no miser, no drunkard, no man without a firs-altar in his house, Do ignorant person, no adulterer, much less an adulteress'. The same Upaniṣad 1518 quotes an ancient verse a man who steals gold, who drinks liquor, who dishonours his guru&rsquo;s bed, who kills &amp; brahmapathese four fall and a fifth also that associates with any one of those four.' It will be shown</p>

<p>a little later how ahingā wag emphasized even in the Upaniṣads. Thus ahimsa, non-stealing, sexual purity, truthfulness had already been emphasized in the oldest Upanisads. That an agoetic 1519 had to give up all property and beg for keeping body and soul together is made clear by Br. Up. III. 5.1 and IV.4.22, Jabalopanisad 5. Gautama III. 10-13, Vasistha x. The other five precepts for priests such as not receiving gold or silver or giving up unguents, flowers, dancing, singing and music are laid down by Gautama 1520 II. 19 and III. 4, Vasisthax.6&amp;c. for Vedic students and ascetics. Vide H. Kern (in &lsquo;Manual of Indian Buddhism, Grundriss p. 70) who remarks that the superior morality for monks is nothing else but the rule of life for the dirija in the 4th ūśrama, when he is a yati and all the details were taken from the Dharma-sūtras and Dharmaśāstras,</p>
<p>Ahimsā &ndash; The Mahābhārata and the Puranas lay great emphasis on abiinsā (not harming or giving pain to a living creature). The Upanisads too emphasized ahimsā. The Chandogya 1521 does so in several passages. In III. 17.4 it says &lsquo;tapas, charity, straight-forwardness, ahimsa, speaking the truth-these are the fees of this (sacrifice without ceremonial)&rsquo;. While describing how the person who has attained true know ledge of the Self does not return ( to this sainsāra), the Chandogya says that he causes no pain to any creature except at tirthas&rsquo;. The Br. Up. (V.2.) says how Prajapati told the gods, the asuras and men that the sound &lsquo;da da da&rsquo; produced by thundering</p>

<p>Upani gads insist on ahiinsa, charity etc.</p>

<p>clouds conveys to the gods the necessity of self-restraint ( dama), to theasures of compassion (daya) and to men of charity (dana). Gautama 1522 specifies eight virtues of the soul, the first of which is compassion for all beings and states that he who has the forty saīskāras performed on him but does not possong the eight virtues does not secure absorption into brahman The Adiparya provides abimsā is the highest dharma for all beings; therefore a brahmana should never harm (or give pain to ) any being'. The words &lsquo;ahirsā paramo dharmaḥ&rsquo; (ahimsā is the highest dharma) ocour very frequently in the Mahābhārata 1523 (e. g. in Dropaparva 192. 38, Santi 265.6, 339. 18, Anusasana 115,25, 116. 38, Aivamedhikaparva 28. 16-18, 43. 21). Santiparva (296.22-24) enumerates thirteen virtues common to all men, of which freedom from cruelty and ahirsa are the first two. Vasistha IV.4, Manu x. 63, Yaj. I. 122 prescribe certain virtues as necessary in men of all varnas. Vide . of Dh. vol. II. p. 10 notes 25-27.</p>

<p>History of Dharmalāstra (Soc. V. Ch. XXIV</p>
<p>fulness, absence of stealing, charity, forbearance, self-oontrol, quiescence of senses, absence of poor spirit or weakness, purity, tapas-this is the tenfold dharma spplicable to all varnas. The Padma says : Dot by (the study of ) the Vedas, nor by gifte nor by tapas, nor by sacrifices do men who kill creatures reach the goal of heaven; ahimsa is the highest dharma, the highest tapas and the highest charity&ndash;this is what the søges always say; mon that are compassionate treat fios, reptiles, stinging insects, lice and the like and human beings as themselves, Matsya goes so far as to state ; great sages do not commend sacrifios in which there is killing; by donating grains of corn gathered in a field, roots, fruits, vegetables, vessel for carrying water according to their ability, sages practising austorities became established in heaven; absence of hatred and greed, self-restraint, compassion towards all beings, control of senses, celibacy, tapas, tenderness, farbearance and firmness—this is the root of the ancient dharua, which is difficult to accomplish. The Brahmānda (II. 31. 35</p>
<p>tagmād-ahimsa dharmasya dvāram-uktam maharṣibhiḥ' ) says that great sages have declared that ahimsā is the door of dharma. The Padma (V. 43. 38 ) says there is no dāna nor tapas equal to ahimsā'. It is interesting to note that the Mateya and Brabmāṇda regard ahimsā as &lsquo;sanātana dharma&rsquo; and condemn animal sacrifices. The Kurma 1525 provides &lsquo;ahirai, truthfulness, non-stealing, celibacy and non-possession of wealth these are briefly declared yamas that produce purity of mind among mon, The great sagos deolare that ahinsa consists in cansing no pain to all boings at all times by thought, word or</p>

<p>dood. There is no dharma superior to ahimah, no happiness higher than the praotice of ) ahimsā; the injury (to life ) that ia caused socording to (Vedic) pracepts is declared to be ahirnar.&rsquo; The Upaniṣads commended a qualified abimsi, while the original Pali books like the Sāmāñña-phala-gutta forbad injury to all living beings. Most of the Puranas, in order to convince the masses that they did not lag behind the Buddhist preachings, generally insist upon unqualified ahimsa. Time brings about strange changes. Professing Buddhists in Ceylon, China, Japan and many other countries have no objection to partaking of fish and meat, while following the insistent advice of the Purinas, millions of Indian people (not only brāhmaṇas but also others like vaisyas and sūdras if Vaiṣpavas) have been striot vege tarians for centuries, though Buddhism vanished from India centuries ago.</p>
<p>It may be noted, however, that some of the Puranas are against varrying the doctrine of ahimsa to extremes. The Brahmapda and Vayu both say that there is no sin, great or small, in killing a person (e. g. a tyrant or a desperado ), when many will live in happiness by his death, 1526</p>
<p>Parta-The Purānas lay the greatest emphasis on what is called purtadharma, works of public utility, charity, soola! service and the relief of the poor and distressed. The word Istāpūrta occurs in the Rgveda once 159 May you be united in the highest heaven with your pitys ( ancestors), with Yams and with iṣtāpārta&rsquo;( merit acquired by sacrifices and works of public utility ). The word ista occurs several times in Rg. (I. 162, 16 1. 164. 15, X. 11. %, X82.2), but the meaning is not certain except in Rg. X. 11. 2 where it appears to mean sacrifice'. Purta also occurs in Rg. VI. 16. 18 and VIII, 46. 21, but the meaning is not certain. &ldquo;Iṣtāpūrta' occurs in several Upanigades</p>

<p>The Chandogya states 1528 But they who, living in a village, practise ( a life of ) sacrifions, works of public utility and alms giving reach toward smoke &amp;c.'. Similarly, the Praśna-upaniṣad Aggerts &lsquo;those, who practise the (mode of) sacrifices and works of publio utility as aotivities to be engaged in, reach only the world of the Moon, and it is these that again return to this world&rsquo;. The Mundaka says &lsquo;deluded people regarding sacrifices and works of public utility as the best do not know ( recognize) any other higher good; having enjoyed ( their reward) on the top of heaven, they again enter this world or even a lower one&rsquo;. 1529 Manu speaks of &lsquo;iṣta&rsquo; and &lsquo;pūrta&rsquo; and recommends that one should always practise with a pleased heart sacrificial gifts and gifts of the pūrta kind according to one&rsquo;s ability on securing a deserving brābmapa. The Amarakośa defines &ldquo;iṣta' as sacrifices and pārta' as works such as digging a well or tank. The Mārkandeya 1530 defines them as follows &lsquo;Maintaining the sacred firos, tapas, truthfulness, study. of the Voda, hogpitality and Vaiśvadova-these are called ista; digging wells and tanks and building temples and distribution of food to those that need it these are declared to be purta. The Agnipurāṇa has similar vorses. The Padma (VI. 243. 10–14) cites the following as dharmakarya (religious works); temples of Viṣnu and Siva, tanks, wells, lotus ponds, forest of vata, pippala, mango, kakkola, jambu and nimba trees, flower garden, distribution of food from mording to Sunset, water distribution outside towns &amp;o. The Skanda 1531 says: the term &lsquo;pūrta&rsquo; is applied in the charma sūstras to the erection of temples, construction of tanks, ponds and wells, laying out parks.

<p>Sometimes the Purānas express ideas that might strike us as rather modern, when they put forward social service and removal of suffering and distress as the highest dharma. In the Mārkandeya 1534 a king solemnly states &lsquo;men do not obtain that happiness in heaven or in the world of Brahma, which springe from giving relief to distressed beings. Sacrifices, gifts, tapas do not conduce to the relief here and in the next world of that man whose heart is not set on relieving the distressed&rsquo;.

The Skanda-purana (Kasikhanda) aver &lsquo;adversities of those good men in whose heart doing good to others is awake (i.e.aotive) vanish and prosperity comes to them at every step. That purity is not secured by bathe at holy places, that reward is not obtained by numerous gifts, that (result) is not obtained by severe austerities, that is obtained by doing good to others.

<p>Bhaldi-The Puranas lay very great emphasis on bhakti (religion of loving faith in God). This is not the place to dilate on the history of the cult of Bhakti from the earliest times to modern days. For that purpose there are special treatises ( some of which are noted below) that may be consulted. But a few words on bhakti in general may be said here before going into the ques tion as to what the Puranas have to say thereon. Traces of the doctrine of bhakti may be discovered even in the Rgvedio hymns and mantras, some of which are full of loving faith in God, particularly in some of the hymns and vorges addressed to Varuna and also to Indra. A few examples may be cited. All my thoughts 1536 (or hymns) praise Indra in unison, seeking light, longing for him, as wivos embrace their husband, their fat young lover, they (thoughts) embrace him (Indra), the divine giver of gifts&rsquo;; &lsquo;your friendship 1537 (with your devotee) is indestructible ( everlasting); to him who desires a cow, you become a cow, to him who longs for a horse, may you be a horso;&rdquo; &lsquo;O Indra, you are far better (or richer) than my father or my brother who does not feed me; (you) and my mother, O Vasu, are equal and protect (me) for (conferring) riches and favoura&rsquo;; &ldquo;You gave to Kaksivat, who offered a hymn and Soma libation to you and who had grown old, Vrcaya, who was a young</p>

<p>Hymns to Indru full of bhakti</p>

<p>woman; you became the wife of Vrsañaśva; all these (tavours) of yours deserve to be loudly proclaimed during the offerings of soma libations&rsquo;; &lsquo;you who, shining brilliantly, come to each house assuming the form of a small man, ( Indral) drink this Soma juice (produced) by being crushed with my teeth and mixed with fried grains, gruel, cake and laud&rsquo;. Comparo Rs. III. 43. 4, X 42. 11, X. 112. 10 (in all of which Indra is called &lsquo;sakhā&rsquo; friend ) and I. 104.9, VII, 32.26 (in both Indra is said to be like a father). It will be clear from these passages that the Vedic seges had reached the stage of sakhya-bhakti, that the sages believed that Indra was like a mother, that he assumed the form of a wife for the sake of a devotee, that Indra partook soma juice from a devotee who, in the absence of the proper imple ments for crushing soma stalks, extracted soma juice from soma stalks crushed with the devotee&rsquo;s own teeth, These stories in the far-off ages of the Rgveda remind us of the stories in the works of the medieval ages about Rama having accepted badars fruit from a Sabari (Bhil woman) devotee who first tasted them with her teeth to see whether they were sweat or sour and the story of the God Vithobā of Pandharpur, having assumed the form of &amp; mahar (an untouchable) and paid up to the Moslom king of Bijapur the money equivalent to the price of corn which, Damaji (a great devotee), who was in charge of the royal granary, allowed people distressed by famine to take away. Some mantras addressed to Varuṇa show the same kind of sakhya-bhakti. Vasiṣtha 1537a prays &lsquo;O Varupa I what is that great offence foom mitted by me) on account of which you desire to harm me, your friend and bard; declare that to me, O invincible and self-willed God, so that ( after propitiating you) I shall be free from sin and may be able quickly to approach you with adoration &lsquo;; &lsquo;whare are those friendships of ours (of you and me) which we safely enjoyed in former times, O self-willed Varuṇa?;I (then) went to your big dwelling house that has a thousand doors; whatever offence we mortals commit against the divine hosta, O Varuna, whatever laws of yours we may have violated in our ignorance (or heedlessness ), do not, O God, harm us on 80count of that sin&rsquo;. It is remarkable that in the Rgveda thors is a verse in which</p>

<p>Though the word &lsquo;bhakti&rsquo; does not occur in the principal ancient Upaniṣads, the doctrine of the bhakti schools that it is God&rsquo;s grace alone that saves the devotee is found in the Katha and Mundaka Upanisads, viz. &lsquo;this Supreme Soul is not to be attained by expositions (of a teacher) nor by intelligence, nor by much learning; He is to be attained by him alone whom the Supreme Soul favours, to him this Supreme Soul discloses His form. &ldquo;1589 This emphasizes the doctrine that God&rsquo;s Grace alone brings balvation to the devotee, The Svetāśvataropaniṣad employs the word bhakti in the same sense in which it is used in the Gita and 1640 other works on bhakti. These matters declared ( here) roveal themselves to that high-souled person who has the highest faith in God and the same faith in his guru as in God&rsquo;. The sane Upanisad emphasizes &amp; doctrine of the bhakti school in *I, desirous of moksa (liberation from samsāra ), surrender myself as my refuge to that God who in former times created (established) Brahmā, who transmitted to him (Brahma ) the Vedas, and who illuminates the intellect of the individual soul&rsquo;,</p>
<p>The word prapadye' in the Svetāóvatara serves as the basis of the doctrine of prapatti' in the Vaiṣpavite system such as that of Rāmānuja.</p>
<p>But among the original sources of the Bhakti cult are the Nārā yapiya section (chapters 335-351 of Citraśala ed. = cr. ed. 322–339) of the Sāntiparva and the Bhagavadgita. For the</p>

Megasthenes states that Heracles (Harikroṇa ? ) was worshipped by Soursenoi (Saurasenas ) on the banks of Jobaros (Yamunā) and had two oities Methora (Mathurā ) and Cleisbora ( Kṭspapura ? ). In the Nārāyaniya it is stated (in chap. 335, 17-24) that king Uparicara Vasu was a devotee ( bhakta ) of Nārāyaṇa, that he worshipped the Lord of Gods according to the sātivata rules that were proclaimed by the Sun, that he (Vasu) consecrated his kingdom, wealth, wife and horses to God, thinking that they all belonged to the Bhagavat (the Adorable One ) and performed sacrificial rites according to the Sāttvata rules.</p>
<p>In the Sāntiparva, Satvata and Pancarātra are identified 1541 and it is said that the seven sages called &lsquo;citraśikhandin&rsquo; (lit. whose top-knots on the head were bright or wonderful) viz. Marici, Atri, Angiras, Pulastya, Pulaha, Kratu and Vasistha, proclaimed the (Pāñcarātra ) śāstra and God Nārāyana told them that the śāstra would be authoritative in the world and that king Vasu would learn the sāstra from Bphaspati to whom it would come by degrees from the seven sages. Chapter 336 of Santi declares that to the north of the Milky Sea there was territory called Svetadvipa, where dwelt devotees of Nārāyana who were called 1542 • Ekāntin' and Pāñcarātra is called &lsquo;Ekānta-dharma&rsquo;. À peculiar doctrine of the Pāñcarātra school is that of the four wyūhas (mūrtis or forms) viz. that the Supreme Person is Vasudeva, the individual soul is Sāṅkarṣana, Pradyuma is mind and springs from Saṅkarsana and Aniruddha is ahankāra and originates from Pradyumna. 1543 It is this doctrine of the four forms of Vāsudeva, each springing from the preceding, that is refuted according to Saṅkara in the Brahmasūtra II. %. 42-45.

<p>Why the colt of Vasudeva was called Pāācarātra bas aot beeg satisfactorily explained anywhere in the English Histories of Indian Philo sophy so far as I know. The name leads to the inference that the cult has something to do with five matters. But why is the word rātra or kāla used? That is the difficulty.

The Alwar literature mentions fivefold aature viz, Pars and the others. Vide K. Č. Varadachari&rsquo;s paper on Some contri butions of Alwars to the philosophy of bhakti&rsquo; in Silver Jabilee vol. of BORI, p. 621. The Paramasa óbitā (1. 39-40 G.O. S. ed.) states that the five great Elements, the five Tanmatras, Abamkāra, Baddhi and aupakta, ( five categories or Tattvas of the Saṅkhya ) are the night ( as it were ) of the Puran and therefore this lastra (which propounds how to be free from the moshes of these five ) is called Pancarātra.</p>

<p>In the Vedāntasūtra 1547 there are four sūtras dealing with the Bhagavata or Panoarātra system. The great Acāryas are not agreed upon their interpretation, Saṅkara saying that all the four sūtras refute some tenets of the Bhagavatas, Rāmāpnja saying that the first two gūtras ( out of four ) contain refutation of the Bhagavata doctrine and the other two do not. Saṅkard cārya makes it clear that the doctrinos of the Bhagavatag that the Supreme God Vāsudeva is the Highest Truth, that he assumes four forms, that the worship of Vāsudeva consists in continuous single-minded contemplation of Vasudeva are not the targets for attack, that what is refuted is the dootrine of the Bhāgavatas that the individual soul called Saṅkarṣana by them springs from Vāsudeva, that Pradyumna ( mind) arises from Saṅkarasana and that Aniruddha (ahamkāra ) arises from Pradyumna. It appears from Saṅkara&rsquo;s remarks 154 on II. 2. 45 that in his day Śāṇdilya was supposed to have promulgated the Bhāgavata or Pāncarātra śāstra, because he did not find the</p>

Though Rāma puja enlarges upon the Pancarātra doctrine in his comments on the last two sūtras out of these four and quotes three passages that may be called Panca rātra, he does not avow either in his Srībbāsya or in bis Vedārtha-saigraha that he is a Sātvata or Pāñcarātra. ___1548. वेदविप्रतिषेधश्च भवति । चतुर्ष घेवेषु परं श्रेयोऽलग्या शाण्डिल्य इदं शासमाधि Taurorullarreara 1 SITE T164 on</p>

In the Dropaparya ( 29. 26-29) there is another and different reference to the four murtis of the Supreme for the benefit of the worlds viz. one performs tapas (asuterities) on the earth, the 2nd has an eye on the world&rsquo;s good and evil deeds; the third comes to the world in a human form and does such acts as men perform; the 4th alumbers for a thousand years and when it arises from slumber conferr the highest boons on those who deserve them.</p>
<p>It may be noted that even in the Mahabharata Nārada&rsquo;a name is connected with Pancarātra. It is said ' this very secret doctrine, connected with the four Vedas, having the benefit of Saṅkhya and Yoga and spoken of as Pañcarātra, was (originally) uttered by the lips of Nārāyaṇa and was again communicated by Narada. 1549</p>
<p>Other great sources of the cult of bhakti are the Bhagavad gita, which is expressly mentioned in the Nārāyaṇiya section (348.8 %D cr.ed. 336.8), the Bhagavatapurana and the Visnu purāṇa. The Gitā contains the words bhakti and bhakta several dozens of times. It may be stated here that the so-called Narada bhaktisutras, Narada-pancarātra, the Sandilya-bhakti-sutra and the several extant Palivaratra-samhitas so far published are all later than the Gita. 1550 The Agnipurana gives the names of 25 works on Pancaratra quoted in the note below.1551The Mahesvara</p>

<p>There is an extensive Literature on the Bhakti cult. Only a few of the important works in Sanskrit, their translations and works in English are noted here. Barth, Hopkins, Keith, Dr. R. G. Bhandarkar and others have propounded different theories as to what Krsna represented, how he was identified with Viṣnu who appears to be another name of the Sun in the Rgveda and came to be regarded as the highest God in Brahmana times (as in Ait. Br. &lsquo;Agnir-vai devānām avamah, Viṣnuh paramaḥ) and came to be identified with sacrifice (Yajāo vai Viṣnuḥ). When Kroṇa, the friend of the Pandavas was identified with the Supreme Spirit, the full-fledged doctrine of Avatāras appeared as in the Gita. The important works on bhakti are : The Narayapiya section of the Santiparya (chapters 322–351 in the Citraśālā edition and chap. 322-339 of the critical edition ); the Bhagavadgitā; several Purāṇas, the most important being Visṇu and Bhagavata ; 1852 the Bhaktisūtra of Sandilya with the bhāṣya of Svapneśvara (ed. by Jivananda, Calcutta 1876) and translation of both these ( in B.

<p>paranuraktirisyare'. This may be interpreted in two ways the highest form of bhakti is affection fixed on God' or &lsquo;bhakti is the highest affection fixed on God&rsquo;. Svapnegyara, the author of a bhāsya on Sandilya, prefers the first and Narada-bhakti gūtra, Tilak and others favour the second. Svapnesvara explains that in general &lsquo;bhakti&rsquo; means &lsquo;affection fixed on a being that is to be won over or worshipped&rsquo;, but that in this sastra it means &lsquo;a particular state of the mind having the Supreme Lord as its object&rsquo; and quotes &amp; verge from the Viṣnupurāṇa uttered by the great devotee Prahlada May that fixed (or unwavering) love, which the ignorant (or unreflecting) people feel for worldly objects, nover depart from my heart, ever remembering you'. The Gitā employs the word &lsquo;priti&rsquo; (affection) and conveys that the word &lsquo;bhakti&rsquo; is derived from the root &lsquo;bhaj&rsquo; to resort to, &lsquo;Those whose minds are on me, whose lives are offered to me, who instruct each other, who speak of me, are always contented and happy. On these who are continuously devoted to me and serve me with affection, I bestow that knowledge by which they roach me&rsquo;. Svapnośvara explains that the word &lsquo;anurakti&rsquo; (with prefix &lsquo;anu&rsquo;) is employed to convey that the affection for God arises after the devotee secures knowledge of the greatness and other attributes of the Bhagavat (Adorable One). In the</p>
<p>Viṣnupurāṇa the word &lsquo;anurāga&rsquo; is used for &lsquo;bhakti&rsquo;, where, after describing the ascent of Rāma and his brothers to heaven, it says that the people of the capital of Kosala who had deep affection for those incarnate parts of the Bhagavat (Viṣṇu ) having their minds fixed on them, reached the position of residence in the same world with them. Sārdilya further 1553 says that there is the teaching that there is immortality for him who abides in Him. In the Chandogya Up. it is said &lsquo;He who abides in brahman reaches immortality&rsquo;. The idea is that immortality being the promise of abiding in God, there will be no indifference in the effort to know God or in the effort to</p>

<p>cultivate highest affection for God. It may be noticed that the sūtras of Nārada appear to be a more paraphrase of Sandilya&rsquo;s aphoriams. 1594 Sandilya furthor (sūtra 7) provides that bhakti, like knowledge, is not an action because it does not follow an effort of the will and that (sūtra 9) it is different from jñāna, as the Gitā refers to self-surrender being attained by one having knowledge after many births (Gitā VII 19).</p>
<p>Our ancestors had a great penchant for classifications, divisions and sub-divisions. Bhakti is divided into laukiki (of the common people), Vaidiki (laid down by the Veda) and adhyatmiki (philosophical), as in Padma V. 15. 164; or mānasi (mental), vāciki (verbal) and kāyiki ( done with the body, such es fasts, vratas &amp;c.) in Padma V. 15. 165–168; into Sāttviki, Rājasi and Tāmasi (as in Bhagavata III. 29.7–10 and Padma VI. 126. 4-11); into best, middling and inferior as in Brahmānda III.1555 34. 38-41 ).</p>
<p>Prapatti (self-surrender) is distinguished from bhakti in works of the Rāmānuja and of other Vaisnava schools. It consists of five points 1556 viz. resolution to yield (to God&rsquo;s will), the abandoning of opposition, faith that God will protect (the devotee ), praying to God to save the devotee, and a feeling of helplessness shown by casting one&rsquo;s soul on Him. Bhakti bas As synonyms the words' dhyāna', &lsquo;upāsanā&rsquo; &amp;o. and is subsidiary to prapatti. The Gita explicitly makes no such distinction. In Gita II. 7 Arjuna speaks of himself as &lsquo;prapanna&rsquo; (who has approached or surrendered himself for salvation). The final advice at the end of the Gitā enjoing what is called prapatti in later works &lsquo;On me fix your mind, become my devotee, sacrifice</p>

<p>Gita on bhakti</p>
<p>961</p>
<p>to me, offer adoration tome; you will certainly reach me; I declare to you truly, you are dear to me. Giving up all (dharmas) duties, come to me as your (only) refuge; I shall release you from all ging; do not griove : 1557 Vide also Gita VII, 14, 15 and XV. 4 for other instances of the use of the root &lsquo;pra-pad&rsquo;. The theory propounded in the Gītā and other works on bhakti was that bhakti led on to &lsquo;prasada&rsquo; (favour or grace) of God which enables the devotee to attain mokṣa. 1558 The Gitā (18.56, 58, 62 ) says &lsquo;a man, though always performing all actions, but solely depending on me, obtains an imperishable and eternal place through my favour; if you fix your mind on me, you will get over all difficulties through my favour; go to Him as the refuge with all your heart, O Arjuna, through His grace you will attain the highest peace and an everlasting abode. In the Vispupurāṇa Prahlāda 1559 is told by the Adorable One as your mind is firmly and devotedly fixed on me you will by my favour attain the highest bliss&rsquo;. The idea of God&rsquo;s grace oocurs both in the Katha and Svetāśvatara Upaniṣads : 1560. The Self, smaller than the small and greater than the great, is hidden in the heart of the creatures; a man who is free from willing anything and free from grief sees the greatness of the Self through the favour of the Creator'.</p>

<p>characteristic of the Nārāyaniya section, is totally absont and further even the names of Saṅkarṣana, Pradyumna and Ani ruddha do not occur in the Gita. In my opinion the Gita is the older of the two, as it propounds the general doctrine of bhakti, while the Pāñcarātra doctrine in the Nārāyaniya is only one of the several bhakti schools. Moreover, the Nārāyaplya section represents that Gita had already been proclaimed and that the knowledge brought from Śyetadvipa by Nārada is the same as that declared in the Harigita (chap. 346. 10–11, 348. 53-54). Santi ( 348. 55-57 ) mentions that there was only one vyūha or there were two, three or four and that the Ekāntins attached great importance to ahimsā. Besides, the worship of Vābudova is older than Pāṇini, since 1562 Pāṇini teaches the formation of the word Vasudevaka as meaning &lsquo;one whose object of worship is Vasudeva&rsquo;. Vide Dr. Bhandarkar&rsquo;s Vaiṣpavism, Saivism &amp;c.&rsquo; paragraphs 2-10 (pp. 3–19 of vol. IV of the collected works) for the antiquity of Vasudeva worship. The general view of most medieval writers on Dharmaśāstra about Pancarātra is represented by the Pārijāta quoted in the K. R. that the Panca rātra 1563 and Pāśupata śāstras are authoritative only so far as they are not opposed to the Vedas. This was the view of the Sūtasambitā also, on which a commentary was composed by the famous Madhavācārya.</p>
<p>In some Purāṇas the word Vasudeva is not derived 1561 from Vasudeva ( as the son of Vasudeva) but from the root yas' to dwell.. Vāsudeva is so called because all beings dwell in the Highest Self and Vasudeva dwells in beings as the soul of all'. Compare Gitā 9. 29&rsquo;I am alike to all beings; none is odious to me nor dear; but those who worship me with faith dwell in me</p>
<p>and I too dwell in them'.</p>

<p>Meaning of bhagavat' and obhagavatā'</p>
<p>Ø8$</p>
<p>The word bhagavat oalls for a brief notice. It was generally applied to Vasudeva. The Viṣnupuriṇa says The word bhaga is applied to the six qualities collectively viz. fulness of sway, manliness (or energy), glory, auspiciousness, knowledge and indifference to wordly objects. This noble word bhagavān applies to Vasudeva who is the Highest Brahma and to no one else'. 1565 The Visnupurana 1566 further states that the word + bhagavat' may be applied secondarily to others on the ground of possessing special qualities &quot; that person may be oalled &lsquo;bhagavān&rsquo;, who knows about the creation and dissolution (of the world), about the origin and final destiny of beings, and knows what is vidya and avidyā ( nescience). Knowledge, strength power, sway, manliness, splendour all these in their entirety, excluding the thres guṇas (and their effects ) that are to be avoided, are expressed by the word bhagavat&rdquo;. Bhagavata is one who worships &lsquo;Bhagavat&rsquo;(ie. Vasudeva). This is an ancient word. It ocours in the Begnagar column inscription of the 2nd century BC.) of Heliodora, a Greek of Takṣaśila and ambassador of Antalikita, who calls himself a bhagavata (adevotee of Vasudeva); vide above p. 516 n. 742 and &lsquo;Indo-Greeks&rsquo; by Prof. A. K, Narain (1957), where at end hegives the full Besnagara Ins. of nine lines and its reading (Plate VI.). It appears that &lsquo;bhagayat&rsquo; was rarely applied to Siya also. The Svetāśvatara Upaniṣad speaks 1547 of Sive as &lsquo;bhagavan&rsquo;. Patanjali in his bhasya on Panini V.2.76 speaks of Sivabhagavata. 156s In the Ghostindi stone</p>

<p>Inscription 1569 in Sanskrit ( near Nagari in the Chitorgadh District of Rajputana ) there is a reference to both Saṅkarṣaṇa and Vasudeva as bhagarat and it calls them Sarveśvara (about 200 B. C.), while the Besnagara inscription speaks of Vāsudova alone and Heliodora calls himself bbāgavata. In some early records such as the Pikira grant of Simbavarman ( E. I. vol. VII. p. 161 ) and in Gupta Inscription No. 4 (at p. 27) Simbavarinen and Candragupta (II) son of Samudragupta are called</p>

<p>Three mārgas ( paths) are spoken of in ancient works viz. karmamārga, bhaktimārga and jñānamārga. It is necessary to say here something about the path of bhakli and that of jñana. Both these paths are deemed to lead to the same goal, viz mokṣa. The mode of approach in the two is, however, different, In the path of knowledge (or ayaktajāsanā) it is not bare book knowledge of brahman as the Supreme Soul and as nirguna that will lead to mokṣa; for that purpose wbat is required is the brāhmi-sthiti (state of identifying oneself with brahma) men. tioned in Gitā II. 72. This condition can be secured only by great efforts and long practice as described in Gitā II. 55 and the following verses. In the path of knowledge whatever actions the person concerned may do are brahmārpana, as described in Gita IV. 18–24. In the path of bhakti the bhakta resigns him self to God&rsquo;s grace and whatever be does Le consigos to the God worshipped by him such as Vasudeva (saguna and vyakla).

<p>best know devotion'. The reply given in XII. 2-7 is those who, being constantly devoted and possogged of the highest devotion, worship me with a mind fixed on me are regarded by me as the most devoted. But those who, restraining the group of the senses, and with a mind equable to all, meditate on the indes cribable, indestructible, udperceived (Principle), which is all pervading, inconceivable, unconcerned, immoveable, and constant, they, devoted to the good of all beings, certainly attain to me. In the case of those whose minds are attached to the unperceived ( Principle or Spirit) the trouble is much greater, since the unperceived goal is attained by embodied beings with difficulty. In the case of those, however, who dedicating all their actions to me and regarding me as their highest goal worship me, meditating on me with a devotion towards none beside me and whose minds are placed on me, I, without delay, become their deliverer from the ocean of saṁsāra and death'. In chapter 9 the path of bhakti is spoken of in these terms it is the chief among vidyās (lores), chief among mysteries; it is the best means of sanctification; it can be directly apprehended, it is in accordance with dharma, imperishable and easy to practise'. According to the Gitā, therefore, the path of bhakti is easier than the path of knowledge.</p>
<p>The Bhagavata says that bhakti is ninefold 1571 viz, hearing about Visṇu, repeating his name, remembering him, worshipping the feet (of the image of Viṣnu), offering pūja, bowing (or homage), treating oneself as the slave of Viṣṇu, treating Him as a friend and surrendering one&rsquo;s soul to Him.

<p>differing nine aspects of bhakti.</p>

<p>History of Dharmatāstra [ Sea, , Ch. xiy</p>
<p>not to be supposed that all these nine methods have to be pra otised at the same time. A devotee practising any one of these, vir, remembering or reciting His name, may thereby become &amp; true bhakta, and may win God&rsquo;s favour and secure liberation (Sandilyasūtra 73). The Gitā (VII. 16-17) states &lsquo;four classes of men, who are (all) fortunate, worship me viz. one who is in distress, the seeker after knowledge, one who seeks some desired object (or seeks wealth), one who is possessed of knowledge; of these he who is possessed of knowledge, who is always devoted and who worships One (Being) only is distinguished (above others ), for to the man of knowledge I am extremely dear and he is dear to me&rsquo;. Sāedilya provides that the four aspects (out of nine) viz. remembering God, reciting His name, Darrating stories about Him and bowing to Him (His imago), find their place in the bhakti of those who are distressed, for these are said to be the means of expiation of sins, as the Viṣnupurāṇa says (II. 6. 39) that remembering Krsna is superior to all praya ścittas. Sandilya further says that those guilty of mortal (grave) sins are only entitled to the bbakti of the distressed; but when their sins have been wiped off they would be entitled to the other forms of bhakti.</p>
<p>Gitā does not expressly enumerato all thega nine modes of bhakti, but most of them can be gathered from various passages of the Gitā such as IX. 14, 26, 27 and from passages in other Purānas. For example, the Viṣṇupurāṇa 1573 says &lsquo;whatever be the expiatory rites, consisting of austerities, deeds of charity &amp;o., to romembor Krṣna is superior to them all&rsquo; and &lsquo;that repetition of His name with bhakti is the best solvent of all sins, as fire is of metals&rsquo;. In the Bhagavata &ldquo;571 it is said &lsquo;whatever the devotee does by his body, speech, mind, organs of sense, by his intelleot or by his soul or by the force of temperament that he follow all that he should offer to Nārāyaṇa who is highest&rsquo;. This is entirely in line with Gitā IX. 27 and may be called *dāsya-bhakti'; while Arjuna&rsquo;s bhakti is &lsquo;sakhya-bhakti&rsquo;, 28 Lord Krspa himselt speaks of him as &lsquo;my devotee and a friend&rsquo; (Gita</p>

<p>The position of the Guta as to worship and one&rsquo;s duties 967</p>
<p>IV.3). It appears that the Gits regards the performance t575 of the duties of his station in life by a bhakta as worship (arcana or pūja) of God &lsquo;worshipping by the performance of one&rsquo;s duties (without an eye to the fruit or towards of them ) God from whom the world springs and by whom all this world is permeated, a man obtains perfection (and not only by offering flowers or by reciting the name of God).</p>
<p>This central doctrine of the Gitā of what is called &lsquo;niskām karma&rsquo; was accepted by the Purānas, The Viṣnu II, 3.25 adopts it. The Agnipurāṇa in chapter 381 gives a summary of the . Gitā in 58 verses which are mostly made up of passages from the Gitā. It winds up the summary with the verse quoted in note 1575 and emphasizes bhakti in the last verse. 1576 The Garuda-purāṇa summarises the Gītā in 28 verses (I. 237-238). The Padma (in VI. 171-188) contains the mahatmya of each of the 18 chapters of the Gitā interspersed with legends about the fruit of reading each Gitā chapter (1005 verses in all). A few further examples may be cited. The Kūrma saya 1577 &lsquo;therefore even &amp; man not possessed of (high) wisdom should perform all his duties (or actions ) abandoning with all efforts the fruit (or roward) of actions; he obtains (high) abode after some time&rsquo;; *actions done after offering them to me do not tend to bind down the door but tend to mukti (liberation). The Mārkandeya also refers to &lsquo;niskāma-karma&rsquo;. The Bhagavata-purāña provides ‘a man performing (the rites) proscribed by the Veda but with out attachment (not caring for the reward) and surrendering them to God Secures freedom from the bondage of karma and the deolaration of the roward (in the Veda) is only meant for stimulating effort.&rsquo;</p>

<p>about God or the ultimate destiny of man or the way to God and did not solve the common man&rsquo;s problems. The Gita took up the problems of the common man; it shows to the lowliest of the lowly that there is hope for him, that the One and the True Being can enter into his life, if he consecrates all the daily duties and Botions of his station in life to God and that salvation will come to every one if one has loving faith in God and surrenders him. self entirely to his Grace. The Gita proclaims (IX. 30-32) &lsquo;If even a man that has been very badly conducted worships me without worshipping any one else he should be regarded as a good man, since he has resolved upon the right course; he quickly becomes a righteous soul and reaches everlasting peace: O Arjuna! you may affirm that my devotee is never ruined. By taking refuge with me even those that are born in despised castes, also women, vaiśyas and sūdras reach the highest goal&rsquo;. The Sandilya-bhakti-sūtra provides 1578 that all down to persons of the despised castos are entitled (to follow the path of bhakti) as they are capable of learning bhakti at second hand just ag they can learn the common rules (of ahimsā, truthfulness &amp;o.). The Puranas speak in the same strain as the Gita and are some times even more explicit and emphatic. The Brahma-purāṇa paraphrases Gita IX, 32 and proceeds &lsquo;my devotee even if he be &amp; candāla attains the desired beatitude, if he be endowed with the right faith; what need be said about others?&rsquo; The Padma 1579 states A Pulkasa or even a svāpaka and other persons belong. ing to Mleccha tribes become eminent and worthy of being honoured, if they are solely devoted to the worship of the feet of Hari'; ' Even a śvapāka is a Vaiṣpava if on his lips there is the name of Hari, in whose heart there is Visgu and in whose stomach goes food offered to Viṣnu'.

Even in the medieval ages in India we have women saints like Mirabai and Āṇdāļ (in South India), untouchables as saints like Nanda, Cokhāmeļā (in Mahārāṣtra), Rai Das (a chāmār disciple of Rāmānanda), sinners like Ajāmila honoured as saints, Saints like Kabir 1582 (a Moslem weaver) and Tukārām.had probably not much book learning, but their hymns are recited by Hindus including orthodox brāhmaṇas.</p>
<p>The invasions and gradual conquest of India by Moslem in vaders from the Northwest throw down a challenge to Hindus from 11th century A.D. onwards. It was met in various ways. The first was the composition of comprehensive digests of amstis of which the earliest extant one is the Kștyakalpataru of Lakṣmidhara (about 1110-1130 A.D.) in the North and Hemādri in the Docoan (third quarter of 13th century). The second and the most important way was on the spiritual front. From the 13th to the 17th century there was a great revival of spirituality on an unprecedented scale which produced saints and mystios in all parts of India such as Jõāneśvara, Nāmadeva, Rāmānanda, Kabir, 1582 Caitanya,</p>

The third was the creation of such independent kingdoms as that of Vijayanagara (1330 1565 A. D.), of Mahārāstra (under Shivaji and the Peshwas) and of the Sikhs in Punjab. This last cannot be dealt with way in this work. The doctrine of bhakti had a great appeal to all sections of the Hindu community and its propagation by the Purānas went a long away in weaning away Hindus from Buddhism. Not only so, Mahāyāna Buddhism took over the doctrine of bhakti and works like the Questions of Milinda&rsquo; and the Saddharmapuṇdarika 1583 contain passages which agree closely with the Gita. The Gitā exhibits a wonderful spirit of tolerance and accommodation, not found in the scriptures of other religions which were founded by great prophets. It says 1584 even those, who are devotees of other deities and worship them with faith, ( indirectly) worship me only but with a pon-śāstric (or irregular ) procedure.' The Bhāgavata-purāṇa elaborates the same idea; O Adorable One! others worship you alone in the form of Siva while following the path promulgated by Siva and propounded in different ways by several acūryas, all worship you who are Lord and who comprehend in yourself all gods; those also who are devotees of other deities and appear to have different ideas do in the end reach you, just as all rivers rising in mountains and flooded by rains enter the ocean from all sides'. The Santiparva 1585 also contains a similar idea Those who worship Brahma, Siva or other deities and whose conduct (or practice ) is intelligent will (ultimately ) come to me, who am the Highest'. This doctrine has ita gorms in the Roveda 1586</p>

<p>itself where it is said the One Reality the Bages speak of under Various names; they call it Agni, Yama, Matari van (wind-god )'. This work cannot afford, for reasons of space, to go into the several bhakti schools such as those of Rāmānuja, Madhya (who postulated five eternal bhedas), Caitanya and Vallabha ( that gave rise to an erotico-mystical brand of bhakti ) and others.</p>
<p>In their zoal for the spread of the oult of bhakti the Purāṇas are sometimes guilty of gross exaggeration. The Brahma purāṇa 1587 says &lsquo;mon even after having committed many sins under the influence of error (or delusion ), do not go to Hell, if they worship Hari who removes all sing; those men also who always remember Janārdana, though they may be guilty of roguery, reach, after they die, the happy world of Viṣnu. Even a man who is habituated to flying into extreme rage, if he recites the name of Hari, has his faults destroyed and attains mukti (liberation ) as the king of Cedi country did&rsquo;. The Vāmana purāṇa 1588 observes “what has that person got to do with many mantras (i, e, he has no use for those), who is a bhakta of Visnu ? The mantra &lsquo;namo Nārāyaṇāya&rsquo; is able to accomplish all objects. Success is for those who have bhakti for Viṣnu; how can there be failure for them in whose heart is enthroned Janārdana dark like a blue lotus ?&rdquo; The Vamana and Padma Purānas say that a man secures the same results by repeating the names of Viṣğu that he would secure by visiting all the tirthas ( sacred places) and holy shrinos 1589 in the world.</p>

<p>and illustrative stories about it. For reasons of space it is not possible to go into this matter at any length. A fow noteworthy points alone will be touched. A few versos eulogising the Bhagavatapurāpa may be cited as samples of extreme exaggera tion. Thousands 1590 of Aśvamedhas and hundreds of Vājapoya sacrifices are not equal to even the 16th part of the story narrated by Suka; he who always recitos a half or a quarter verse of the Bhagavata secure the merit of Rajasūya and Aśvamedha; he who listens to the words of the śāstra of Suka ( i.e. Bhagavata ) at the time of death, Govinda being pleased with him confers on him Vaikuntha; this is a good expiation for all sinners viz. uttering the name of Viṣnu, since ( at that time) their mind has Viṣpu as the only object of thought&rsquo;. 1591 Another point is the story of Ajāmila in the Bhāgavata (VI. 1. 20 ff and VI. 2), Padma( L 31. 109 and VI. 87.7 ) and other Purāṇas. Ajāmila 1592 ( who aban doned his brāhmana wife and kept a mistress) was a moral wreck addicted to gambling and thieving. When on his death bed at the age of 80 he loudly called upon his youngest son named Nārāyana (out of ten sons born of the mistress ) with affection and recited that name and thought of that alone, he became free from his sing and attained a high position difficult to attain'. Such stories have given rise to the common belief that the last thought at one&rsquo;s death leads to a new birth appro priate to that thought (unte matih sā gatih). The Upaniṣads contain the germ of the idea of the last thought; vide, Chān. Up. III, 14, 1, VIII. 2. 10, Bļ. Up. IV. 4. 5. In the &lsquo;Questions of Milinda&rsquo; (SBE vol. 35 pp. 123–124) this idea of the importance of the last thought is taken up.

<p>The idea of the last thought</p>
<p>repentance and complete surrender to God&rsquo;s will, cancels the result of a whole life of crime and sin. This is the moral of Ajāmila&rsquo;s atory, but it is liable to be grossly misapprehended and might create a complacent belief that a man may commit as many sins in his life as possible, but if he remembers God at his death and repeats His name then, all sins of his are cleared away and wiped out. This is a rather dangerous doctrine. The Gita ( VIII. 5-7) puts the matter in a clear light. &ldquo;That person, who remembers me at the time of death and passes from the world leaving the body, attains my essence, there is no doubt about that. Whatever form a man remembers when he leaves the body, to that he goes, because he was always engrossed in that form. Therefore remem ber me at all times and engage in battle; there is no doubt that having fixed your mind and intellect on me you will attain to me'. This passage of the Gṛtā suggests that a person will remember the name of God at the time of his death only if he had been 80 doing all his life, while engaged in actively performing all his duties and not caring for the rewards thereof and that it is extremely rare or almost impossible for a man to remember God at the last moment when throughout his life he had been ungodly and a great sinner. The above idea is again emphasized in verses 10-13 of chap. VIII (of the Gitā) and in chap. XIII, 3 (yo yac-chraddhaḥ sa ova saḥ).</p>
<p>In spite of the doctrine that God is one 1593 and the doctrine that whatever form of the deity one may worship, the worship reaches the Supreme Being, Vaiṣṇavas and Saivas have been wrangling and abusing one another. For example, the Varāha</p>

Vide H, of Dh, vol. II pp. 714-715 and pp. 118-119 above.

<p>purana makos Rudra declare the supremaoy of Viṣnu (obap. 15% 70.14 Narayanah paro devah), denounce Saiva-siddhantas that are outside the pale of the Vedas and put forward the outstanding view &lsquo;that such non-Vedic views were promulgated by Siva himself at the request of Viṣṇu in order to delude people. Some Purāṇas started by saying that the Bauddhas and Jainas 1595 were asuras and enemies of gods that were purposely deluded by god. For example, the Matsya (24. 43-49) says that the sons of Raji deprived Indra of his kingdom and share in sacrifices, that Brhaspati, at Indra&rsquo;s request, deluded the sons of Raji by composing a treatise of Jina-dharma which was opposed to the Veda and then Indra killed them. Vāyu 96. 230-32, Matsya 47. 11-12, Bhagavata I. 3. 24 appear to suggest that Visnu himself deluded the people. The Agni (16. 1-4) also says with reference to the Bauddhas that Viṣnu deluded them.

<p>Asuras in the form of heretics purposely misled by Visnu 975</p>
<p>defeated by the asuras (who also practised tapas and studied the Veda) they approached Viṣnu and prayed to him to help them and to destroy the asuras and that then Viṣnu produoed from his body Māyā-moha (lit. who causes delusion by wiles) and made him over to the gods. Māyāmoha, who was naked, had shaved his head and held a bunch of peacock feathers in his hand, went to the asuras that were practising tapas on the banks of the Narmadā (III. 18. 1-2) and told them that if they followed his words they would secure mukti, led them away from the path of the Voda, taught them formulas of sceptical reasoning and weaned them away from their dharma. Then he approached other asuras and taught them that sacri ficing animals was sinful, taught them nirvāṇa and the doctrines of vijnanavāda. Some of the passages are very striking &lsquo;In a short time the asuras were deluded by Māyāmoha and abandoned all concern with the path depending on the three Vedas. Some condemned the Vedas, some condemned the gods, while others condemned the body of sacrificial rites and brāhmaṇas. (They thought or said) The statement that killing an animal (in sacrifices) is desirable for the sake of Dharma (for accumulating merit) does not stand to reason; to say that offerings burnt by fire would conduce to reward (in the next world) is childish talk; ( if it be said that ) Indra attained the position of God by means of many sacrifices and enjoys the fuel-sticks of the sami tree, then an animal ( that subsists on leaves) is superior to Indra (who enjoys hard and thorny sami samidhs). If it is desired (by the Veda) that the animal killed in &amp; sacrifice attains heaven, then why does not the sacrificer kill his own father in &amp; sacrifice (and send him to heaven)? If one (the son) performs śrāddha (with the thought) that what is eaten by one (brāhmaṇa diner at śrāddha) tends to give satisfaction to another (i, e. the deceased father of the offeror of śrāddha), then travellers would not carry food ( on their baoka) which causes weariness to them.&rsquo; These are the arguments used by atheists (oārvākas). It is remarkable that even tāntrik works like the Kulārṇavatantra make Śiva say that he declared certain sāstras purely for deluding certain bad people who did not know the Kaula dharma.1597</p>

<p>History of Dharinatāstra (Sec, V, Ch. XXIV</p>
<p>proceeded so far as to say 153 that a brāhmapa who is not a Valspava is a heretic, that Vispu himself assuming the form of Buddha proclaimed a false sastra, and that all sastras such as the Pasupata, Vaibeṣika of Kanāda, Nyāya of Gautama, Saṅkhya of Kapila, Carvaka of Bṛbaspati are tāmgan; that the māyāvāda (of Saṅkara) is a false sastra and is disguised Bauddha (doctrine) and the extensive śāstra (Pūrvamlmā gā) of Jaimini is con demned, since it made gods as of no use ( in his system ). The words of the Padma-purāna are ; &lsquo;Listen O Goddess, while I declare to you in order the tā masa śāstras, by merely remembering which even wise men become singers. First of all I promulgated Saiya sastras such as the Pasupata system, then the following were declared by brāhmaṇas that were possessed (or engrossed ) by my sakti (power); viz. Kaṇāda proclaimed the great Vaiśeṣika system, the Nyāya and Saṅkhya systems were declared respectively by Gautama and Kapila : the much despised Carpāka doctrine was declared by Bphaspati, while Viṣnu, assuming the form of Buddha, promulgated, for bringing about the destruction of dailyas, the false doctrine of Bauddbas that go about naked or dressed in blue garments; I myself, O goddess, assuming the form of a brahmapa declared in the Kali age the false gāstras of the doctrine of Māyā which is bauddha in disguise. The brāhmaṇa Jaimini composed the great system of Pūrvamimāṁsa, which is unmeaning on account of its atheistic discourse&rsquo;. Vijñāna-bhikṣu in his Saṅkhya-pravacanabhāsya ( who flourished about 1550 A. D.) quotes eleven verges from the Padma VI. 263 and holds the peculiar view that no śāstra that is ūstika (admits &amp; soul ) is unauthoritative nor is there any contradiction, each śāstra being of full force and true in its own sphere. The original Saṅkhya sūtra, on which he comments, tries to establish the impossible thesis that the teachings of the Saṅkhya are not in real or irreconcilable contradiction with the doctrine of all-pervading oneness of brahma or with the doctrine that brahma is bliss (ānanda) or the system of theism (i. e. a personal God ).

<p>The Visnu and Padma do not stand alone in this strango story of Viṣṇu himself or through Rudra teaching false doctrines for deluding the ungodly or those that dissented from or reviled the Vedas. There were other Purāṇas that sing the same tune; for example, the Kūrma-purāpa indulges in a vendetta against many śāstras and systems in several places. A few passages are set out here. (Devi says) * the various 1601 sastras that are found in this world and are opposed to the Vedas and smrtis are based on tamas (ignorance), viz. Kapāla, Bhairava, Yamala (a class of Tantra works), Vāma (left-hand practices of a class of Tantras), Arbata (Jain doctrines ), these and others are meant for deluding (persons ); I produced these sāstras in another birth for deluding people&rsquo;; &lsquo;therefore in order to protect (people) against those who were beyond the pale of the Vedas and for the destruction of sinners we shall, O Siva, compose sastras for deluding then%B Rudra being thus advised by Madhava (Viṣnu) composed śāstras that delude and Viṣnu also urged on by Rudra did the same;</p>

After describing their thoughts and aspirations the Gita winds up these perform sacrifices which are so in name only with hypocrisy and against the prescribed procedure; they hate me in their own bodies and in those of others; these impure and cruel enemies I continually throw down in demoniac wombs; coming into demoniac wombs and being deluded, in each birth they go to vilest states without ever coming to me'. This is entirely different from what the Padma and other Purānas say about Pāśupatas, Pāñcarātras and about non-Vaiṣpavas.</p>
<p>Both the Bhagavata and the Padma say that 1604 (the cult of) bhakti first arose in Dravida country, it progressed or prosperad in the Karnātaka, it was found in only a few places in Maha rastra and declined in the Gurjara country; it was, on account of the terrible Kaliyuga, broken up by heresies and remained weak for a long time; but having reached Vṛndāvana ( near Mathurā ) it got a fresh start and assumed fine form. In book XI. the Bhāgavata again reverts to this assertion that in Kali people are solely devoted to Nārāyaṇa only in a few places but to the greatest extent in the Dravida country where flow the rivers Tāmraparpi, Kștamālā, Kaveri and Mahānadi flowing to the west and states that those who drink the waters of these rivers are generally devotees of Vasudeva.</p>
<p>Most great moral and spiritual upheavals have a tendency to reach &amp; very low level in course of time. That appears to have happened in the case of bhāgavatas. The Atri-smrti has &amp; verse containing a sarcastio reference to bhāgavatas 1605 : Those who are devoid of Vedic studies learn sāstras ( such as grammar, Vedānta, logic &amp;o.), those who are wanting in śāstrio lore become readers of Purāṇas for others; those who cannot be readers of Purāṇas become tillers; but those who are broken down even</p>

<p>thore, become bhāgavatas&rsquo;. Atri appears to say that bhāgavatas are idlers, who do not study Veda or śāstra or who cannot even read Puranas to othera for their livelihood or do not engage in agriculture and who pretend to be worshippers (or bhaktas ) of Visnu or Krspa and fatten on what is given by others that are deluded into thinking that they have forsaken everything for the sake of their love of God. They become what are called ' buwās' in Marāthi and other modern Indian languages.</p>
<p>Another striking development of the bhakti cult is the Erotic Mysticism (madhurā bhakti) associated with the worship of Kṭspa and of Rādha in that form of Vaiṣpavism established by Caitanya and Vallabhācārya. For the Vaisnava movement inspired by Caitanya, vide Dr. S. K. Do&rsquo;s work on the Vaisnava faith and movement in Bengal' (Calcutta 1942) and the author&rsquo;s &lsquo;History of Sanskrit Poetics&rsquo; (1951) about Ujjvala nilamapi of Rūpa-gosyamin pp. 298-302. In the bhakti cult established by Vallabhācārya great importance is attached to the guru, who is one of the descendants of Vallabhācārya and to whom almost divine honours are paid. A wonderful develop mont of bhakti towards Rāma, regarded in the Rāmāyana and in popular tradition as a paragon of restraint and all manly virtues, culminated in an erotic mysticism about Rama and Sitā also. The devotees of this mystic cult have to consider themselves as brides of Rāma or the female friends of Sitā, they are supposed to seek Lord Rāma&rsquo;s favour through Sita, who graciously intercedes with the Lord for the devotees. Among the followers of Vallabhācārya the guru tells the devotee to look upon him the guru) as Krsna and upon himself or herself ag Rādhikā.</p>
<p>For want of space further details about these bhakti culte have to be passed over.</p>
<p>Supreme importance is attached to Vedic mantras and also Paurāṇika mantras. They will have to be dealt with at some length in the sections on Tantras and on Pūrvamimāngā. But some treatment of mantras, particularly vedic, may be given here as well. The word mantra occurs about twenty-five times in the Rgveda. Only once does the word mantrakt occur in the Rgveda 1606 (IX. 114, 2) &lsquo;O sage Kaśyapal offer obeisance</p>

I. 67. 2 (addressed to Agni) ning &lsquo;holding in his hand all powers (or riches), sitting in a cave (i. e. concealed) he placed the gods in fright; heroes (men or gods ) that place (offor) prayers know him (Agni) to be here when they recite mantras formed in the heart.&rsquo; There is no direct reference to psis here (but to narah) and what is emphasized is that mantras already extant as the heart&rsquo;s outpourings enable the reciters of the mantras to find him (Agni). There is nothing to show that the mantras referred to in the verse are meant to be impromptu; the idea is rather that mantras that already existed and conveyed heartfelt devotion have to be employed to find Agni. The very next verse makes the position clear when it says, &lsquo;like the unborn (Sun) he ( Agni) supports the wide earth and fixes in its place the sky on account of the mantras that turn out true&rsquo;. This clarifies two things, viz. that when this mantra (I. 67. 3) was recited there already existed a host of mantras 1607 and secondly, that the mantras that existed long before were deemed to have helped in supporting the earth and the sky. The ancient mantras were supposed to bring Indra to attend thrice in the day for a short time to the sacrifices of devotees when invoked with mantras addressed to him (Rg. III. 53. 8); similarly, mantras when recited by wise man bring Yama to receive offerings ( Rg. X. 14, 4); Rg.

A few striking passages are set out here. &lsquo;Indeed, God Brahmanaspati (Lord of Prayer) proclaims the mantra fit for recitation (by the mouth of the hotr ), in which the gods Indra, Varuṇa, Mitra, Aryaman make their abode, O Gods !'; &lsquo;We utter that very mantra ( in which Indra and other gods are praised together) in our sacrifices, the mantra being one that produces bliss and being free from all blemishes (or is incomparable ); Do place among the Gods a mantra that is not short, that is well-arranged and that is well ornamented; ancient fetters do not reach him who is in ( the good grace of) Indra by the sacrifice ( or praise ); &lsquo;I address the same mantra for you (all) and offer for you ( all) one offering (into fire)&rsquo;. From these passages it appears that when these verses were recited there was a body of already existing mantras; which were supposed to be inspired by the Lord of prayers (or speech) and from which the choice of a long and well-formed one was to be made. Apart from the above passages the word mantra occurs in Rg. 1. 31. 13, 1. 74 1. 1. 147, 4, I. 152. 2, II. 35. 2, VI, 50. 14, VII. 7.6, X. 50. 4 and 6, X. 106. 11, in only one of which (Rg. II. 35.2), apart from Rg. I, 67.2 already quoted, the words &lsquo;hṣda ā sutaztam mantram&rsquo;(mantra well chiselled from the heart) ara used and in another verse more simply the word &lsquo;atakṣan&rsquo; (in VII. 7.6 mantram ye vāram naryā atakṣan) alone is used. In two passages (Rg. X. 95.1 and X. 191, 3 first half) the word &lsquo;mantra&rsquo; appears to mean &lsquo;consultations, holding counsel together&rsquo;. In Rg. I. 20.4, Rbhus are called &lsquo;satyamantrāḥ&rsquo; and are said to have made their parents young. There are controversies about what the Rbbus stand for and it is difficult to say what is meant by &lsquo;satyamantrāḥ&rsquo; in relation to Rbhus. Rg. VII. 76. 4. is a 1609 somewhat enigmatic verse. It means they (Aogirases) alone, (our) ancient pitṛs, learned (or wise) and following the right path, enjoyed companionship among gods and they found out the Light (the Sun) concealed (by Svarbhānu, eclipse); they, whose mantras were true, brought forth Uṣas.&rsquo; In some passages where other words like sloma or brahma are used, there is</p>

VII. 32.2 and X. 50.7. Other words like gir (several hundred times), dhiti (about 100 times); brahma (over a hundred times) mati (about 100 times), maniṣā (over 60 times), vacas and vacasyā (over 100 times), stoma (about 200 times), sukirti (five times), sūkta (four times) are employed in the sense of thought, word or thought out hymn or verse of praise&rsquo; and in several cases the sages of the Rgveda state that it is a new verse or hymn of praise that they employ.

It is a remarkable fact that when words like &lsquo;sukirtiḥ&rsquo; and &lsquo;sūkta&rsquo; that occur only four or five times in the whole of the Rgveda are qualified by the word &lsquo;new or fresh&rsquo;, the word &lsquo;mantra&rsquo; occurring so many times does not even once bear the adjective &lsquo;new&rsquo;. This emphasizes the conclusion stated above that in the times of many of the extant Rgvedic versos mantras were a large group already existing, from which prayers were drawn as occasion required, though now and then new verses were added to those already existing. It may here be stated that in some places the Rgveda looks upon prayers ( dhiti) as divine and as on the same level with Asyins, Uṣas, and the Sun ( VIII. 35. 2 ) and that ancient prayers wera inherited from ancestors (III. 39.2 seyamasme sanajā pitryā dhih').</p>

<p>About the meaning and purpose of Vedic mantras there are great controversies. This much may be said here that according to the Pūryamimāṁsā system the whole Veda is concerned with sacrifices, that Veda is divided into two classes, Mantra and Brāhmana, that Vidhis (hortatory passages) are the most important part of the Veda, that a very large number of Vedic passages are mero arthavādas ( that contain either praises of vidhis or are to be explained metaphorically or merely repeat what already exists or are of a legendary character ) and that mantras only serve the purpose of bringing to the mind of the sacrificor or priests what is to be done in a sacrifice and that the words used in the mantras ordinarily bear the game meaning as that in popular Sanskrit.</p>
<p>Long before Yaska ( several venturies before Christ) there were several schools of Vedic interpretation such as the Aitibāsikas ( who acc. to Nir. II. 16 said that Vitra was an Asura son of Trastr, while acc. to the Nairuktas Vrtra moans only * cloud' and the Veda contains metaphorical descriptions of battles, that the twins that Saranyu is said in Rg. X. 17. % to have given up are according to the Nairuktas Indra and the Mādhyamikā-vāk, while according to the Aitihāsikas they are Yama and Yami, as stated in Nit, XII, 10), the school of Naidānas is mentioned about &lsquo;syāla&rsquo; and &lsquo;sāma&rsquo; in Nir. VI 19, the school of ancient yājõikas in Nir. V. 11. Rg. I. 164. 32 (ya im cakāra ) is differently explained by the Parivrājakas ( ascetic school) and the Nairuktas ( etymologists). The Nirukta also mentions the names of seventeen individual predecessors ( from whom it differs often and who differ among themselves ) such as Āgrāyaṇa, Audumbarayana, Kautsa, Gārgya, Gālava, Sākatā yana, Sākapūṇi. There are several mantras of which two different meanings are given in the Nirukta as in Nir. V. 11 on Rg. VIII. 77.4. In Rg. I. 164 there are several verses with two meanings or more e. g. verse 21 (yatrā suparnā &amp;c.) has two meanings (aco. to Nir. III. 13 ) one relating to the devatā Sūrya (adhidairata ) and the other spiritual ( adhyātma ); similarly, verse 32 of the same hymn has two meanings in the Nirukta (II. 8); the verse 39 (rco akṣare parame vyoman) is explained in four ways by Sāyaṇa; verse 41 ( gaurir-mimāya) is explained by Sāyaṇa in two ways, both being different from Yagka&rsquo;s explanation ( in Nir.</p>

<p>XI, 40 ); verse 45 ( oatvāri vāk parimitā padani) is explained in six ways (more or less different from each other ) by Sāyaṇa; it is also explained in the Mahābhāsya (p. 7 of M.M. Abhyankara. gastri&rsquo;s ed.). The verse' catvāri śrógā' (Rg. IV. 58. 3) has been the subject of varying explanations from very early times. Nir, (XIII, 7) explains it as referring to Yajña. The Mahābhāgya (p. 6 of the Mahābhāsya ibid.) also does the same. Sayapa explains it as referring to Agni ( identified with yajña) and Sūrya. This verse is a riddle. Sabara 1611 in his bhāsya on P.M.S. I. 2. 38. (&lsquo;abhidhāne arthavādaḥ&rsquo;) explains it but Kumārila differs from him. Sāyaṇa and others explain it (e. g. the word * tridhā') with reference to Mantra, Brāhmaṇa and Kalpa, but when this verse was first proclaimed there must bave been no Brāhmaṇas and Kalpasūtras. In several cases the Nirukta gives the adhidaivata (physical) and adhyātma (metaphysical or spiritual) or adhiyajña and adhyātma as in Nir. X. 26 (on Rg. X. 82.2 Viśvakarmā vimanā), Nir. XI. 4 ( on Rg. X. 85. 3, adhiyajõa and adhidaiyata meanings ), Nir. XII. 37 (on Vāj. S. 34.55 &lsquo;sapta rsayah&rsquo;, both adhidaivata and adhyātma ), Nir. XII, 38 (On Atharva X. 8. 9 Tiryag-bilas-oamasa &amp;o.' both adhidaivata and adhyatma). In Rg. (I. 164) verses 11-13 and 48 contain a very imaginative and poetic description of the year, the seasons, months and total days and nights.</p>
<p>In recent years Sri Aurobindo in &lsquo;Hymns to the mystic Fire&rsquo; (translated in the esoteric sense, 1946 ) and his ardent and devout disciple Sri. T. V. Kapali Sastry (in &lsquo;Rgbhāṣya bhūmika in Sanskrit and its English translation, Pondicherry 1952 ) have started a theory about the Rgveda mantras which must be briefly stated and examined. Śri Aurobindo first intended to publish an edition of the Rgveda with a word by word Construction and an English translation. But he gave up that idea on account of other pro-occupations and rests content in the above book with the text and translation of about 230 verses in all from the 1st, 2nd and 6th mandalas of the Rgveda and a foreword of 48 pages in which he propounds his theory.

<p>this was being written by the present writer, Śri Aurobindo&rsquo;s large work of 634 pages on the Veda' published in 1956 reached his hands. Over 60 hymns are dealt with in this big book and 283 pages are devoted to the elaboration of his theory first out lined in the brief work of Sri Aurobindo mentioned above and reiterated with greater emphasis. On page 9 of the work of 1956 he states &ldquo;the ritual system recognized by Sāyaṇa may stand, the naturalistic sense discovered by European scholar sbip may, in its general conceptions be accepted, but behind there is always the true and still hidden secret of the veda - the secret words which were spoken for the purified in soul and the awakened in knowledge'. In this work also he sticks to the meaning of yta as truth and on p. 84 translates &lsquo;ptam&rsquo; as &lsquo;Truth-conscious nass&rsquo;, when in his first work he translated &lsquo;fta-cit&rsquo; as Truth-con sciousness'. Instead of comparing the several hundred passages where the word ṣta occurs in the Rgveda he sticks to his own rendering which is unacceptable to most scholars and makes a Very perfunctory attempt at finding the correct meaning. One should like to have some clear examples of the distinction between Light and Consciousness in modern times and also in the Veda. So far as the present writer knows, in the language of ancient symbolism Consciousness is identified with Light. In the recently published book he deals with legs than it th of the total hymns (1017 or 1028 ) of the Rgveda Readers are asked to subscribe to his views although he condesconds to translate in the first work less than oth of the total number of verses in the Rgveda and hardly ever enters into a discussion about the meaning of words like fta. Śri Aurobindo ( Foreword p. III) concodes that Sāyaṇa does not reject the spiritual authority of the Veda and that sāyana does not deny that there is a higher truth contained in the rks. He further says (IX) that we must take seriously the hint of Yāska (Śri Aurobindo does not quote the Nirukta. but probably he has in mind Nir. I. 20 sākṣātkrtadharmāna pgayo babhūvuḥ'). Then he proceeds to state (XVII) that many whole hymns of the Veda bear on their face a mystic meaning and that the rṣis (p. XIX) for the sake of secrecy resorted to double meaninga, a device easily manageable in the Sanskrit language. This is a hypothesis which cannot at all be accepted and is no more than more conjecture. The Vedic mantras were composed thousands of years ago, when all persons among whom the gages moved must have spoken the same language, though generally not 80 polished and poetical as that of the mantras and they were not addressed to men like the moderns whose</p>
<p>Śri Aurobindo&rsquo;s Vedic interpretations</p>
<p>9876</p>
<p>every day thoughts, surroundings and languages are entirely different. Both the Master and the disciple (Mr. Kapali Sastry) cause confusion (or, may be, are themselves confused ) by sup posing that the difficulties of the modern students of mantras did exist even at or near the time of the mantras. The most sublime thought of the Rgveda is that there is only one Spirit behind the various gods, Indra, Mitra, Varuṇa, Agni, Yama, Mātariśvan, that originally there was only that One, there was no day and night, no death and immortality. Sri Aurobindo himself describes (p. XXXII) Rg. I. 164. 46 and X. 129.2 as the summit of the vedio teaching.' This view of the one Entity is also illustrated in Rg. VIII. 58. % &lsquo;one and the same Agni is kindled in many places, the one Sun enters the whole world and becomes many; the one Dawn illumines all this (physical) world, One became all this ( assumes various forms)&rsquo;. No secrecy was observed about this fundamontal truth and it was proclaimed in mantras that can be understood even by an ordinary man of to-day who knows a little Sanskrit. Because we of these recent centuries cannot understand some mantras, that does not mean that the ancient seers were guilty of a subterfuge and purposely composed mantras with two meanings. They might have indulged in the pastime of two meanings (express and metaphorical) in a few cases as postic devices.1612 It is no fault of the sages, if we cannot understand their meaning, just as a blind man, who does not see a wooden post and comes to grief by dashing against it, should not blame the post, but should blame himself; we are to blame ourselves and should not foist upon the ancient sages a stratagem created by our own imagination or lack of know ledge (Nir. I. 16 ).1613</p>

<p>The Master ( Śri Aurobindo ) and the pupil are at variance about the poetic character of the Mantras, Śri Aurobindo (p. XXXIV) after saying that his translation is a literary and not a strictly literal one speaks of the hymns as &lsquo;great poetry&rsquo;, magnificent in their colourlag and images, poble and beautiful in rhythm. Now let us hear the disciple. On p. 63 Mr. Kapali Sastry states the hymnal poetry is unusual, different from other poetry, even from the most superb specimen' and then he chides the readers and men like the present author and impliedly his own Master it is not permissible (why?) to class Vedic hymns with poetry of a literary and aesthetic kłod'. On p. 31 Mr. Sastry asserts that mantras have two meanings, the inner which is psychological or spiritual and the true meaning and a gross or external meaning for common men' and he adds that the use of words with double meanings was deliberate but was sffortless and natural.</p>

<p>History of Dharmadāstra (Seo. V, Ch. XXIV</p>
<p>Śri Aurobindo admits (p. XXXIII) that there are some key words in the Rgveda such as sta, kratu, gravas, ketu and that elabo rate work would have to be done to fix the meanings of such worde. But he does not undertake a study of the key words (each of which except &lsquo;ketu&rsquo; occurs hundreds of times in the Rgveda) by comparison of Rgvedic passages and considering the light shod on these words by the other Samhitās and the Brāhmaṇas. He mentions the occurrence of the word ṣta in I. 164. 47 and IV. 21. 3 (sadanat-Flasya) and &lsquo;stasya pathya&rsquo; in Rg. III. 12.7 and jumps to the conclusion that the last two words mean &lsquo;the path of truth&rsquo; and remarks that we have to find the path of Truth' (Foreword p. XXX.). In the H. of Dh. vol. IV. pp. 2-5 it has been shown that șta in the Rgveda has three meanings, viz. (1) the regular and general order in the cosmos ;(2) the correct and ordered way of the cult of the gods ; (3)&lsquo;moral conduct of man&rsquo; In the Rgveda sta is not the same as &lsquo;satya&rsquo;, but the two are differentiated. In Rg. V. 51. 2 the Visve-devas 1614 are described as stadhitayaḥ (whose thoughts are fixed on ṣta) and &lsquo;satyadharmāṇaḥ&rsquo; (whose ordinances are true or fixed) and the sage prays to them to come to his sacrifice and to drink (ajya and soma) by the tongue of Agni. In Rg. X 190. 1 both sta and satya are said to have arisen from rigorous or refulgent tapas (of the Creator). In the Rgveda sta involved a very wide conception as stated above and &lsquo;satya&rsquo; had a restricted moaning viz. truth or static order. In Rg. IX, 113. 4 Soma is described as one who proclaims sta, satya and średdhā (faith). Therefore, Sri. Aurobindo is quite inaccurate when he translatos ṣta by the word Truth' and draws important conclusions from his inaccurate renderings. Similarly, Sri. Aurobindo does not give a correct rendering when he translates (Foreword p. XXX) the word stacit' as truth-conscious ( whatever that may mean sco. to Sri. Aurobindo). Mr. Kapali Sastry (p. 46 ) goes &amp; step further than his great master by stating that in the mantras true know ledge is termed stacit' Truth&ndash;consciousness ( with a capital C). It appears that both Master and disciple are misled by the meaning of &lsquo;cit&rsquo; in such an attribute as sat-cit-ananda', applied to brahma. They appear to take ta-cit' as meaning two distinct things yta' and &lsquo;cit&rsquo;. The word &lsquo;rtacit&rsquo; occurs</p>

The present author wonders whether Sri Aurobindo and his disciple cared to go into the meaning of *ptacit' in the several verses where it occurs. They pay no attention to the word &lsquo;ļṇacit&rsquo; that occurs in Rg. II, 23. 17 as an attribute of Brahmanaspati. 1616.</p>
<p>The space at the author&rsquo;s disposal does not allow him to abow up the other unwarranted propositions and conclusions of Śri Aurobindo and Mr. Kapali Sastry. The author will set out the final conclusion of Sri. Aurobindo (Foreword p. XXIX) &ldquo;what then is the secret meaning, the esoteric sense which emerges by this way of understanding the Veda ? &hellip;&hellip;&hellip; The thought around which all is centred is the seeking after Truth, Light, Immortality. There is a truth deeper and higher than the truth of outward existence, a Light greater and higher than the light of human understanding which comes by: revelation and inspiration, an immortality towards which the soul has to rise. We have to find our way to that, to get into touch with this Truth and Immortality.&rdquo; This is a grand peroration, but all this is built on shaky and meagre foundations, such as the wrong mean ings attached to the words ṣta and ștaoit. Mr. Kapali Sastry ( on p. 46 ) practically reproduces this grand summing up of his guru.</p>
<p>Mr. Kapali Sastry launches (on pp. 22–26 ) a bitter diatribe against Sāyaṇa but ultimately he has to admit (pp. 27–28 ) that Sāyaṇa is not merely useful, but indispensable to the students of the Veda. On p. 23 he translates a sūtra from Jaimini&rsquo;s work the purpose of the Veda being ritualistic, words which do not have that significance are useless' and remarks that this clearly lays down that the only purpose of the Vedas is that of ritual, those that do not pertain to that (ritualistic action) are worthless. The author doubts whether Mr. Kapali Sastry has carefully read the Purvamimānsāsūtras or has at least</p>

<p>Correctly stated the position; what he quotes is the Pūrvapakṣa view ( prima facie view). Jaimini&rsquo;s position is contained in the 7th sūtra 1617 as those passages (that do not directly concern themselves with ritualistic actions ) form one syntactically connected whole with the passages prescribing ridhis they are to be considered as commendatory of the vidhis'. Mr. Sastry is not satisfied with saying (on p. 8) the sages Madhucchandas and others are seers of the mantra, the Gods were present to the vision of these seers of old', but he adds &lsquo;this seer of the beyond is alao the hearer of the truth; therefore that the poet-geors are truth-hearers kavayah satyaśı utah, is famous in the Veda&rsquo; (p. 64). The present writer wonders whether Mr. Sastry carefully read the original passages where the words kayayaḥ satyaśrutaḥ&rsquo;occur in the Veda. The words kaziḥ and karayaḥ occur several hundred times in the Rgveda, but &lsquo;satyaśrutaḥ&rsquo; occurs only thrice in Rg. V. 57. 8, V. 58.8 and VI. 49.6; Rg. V. 57, 8 and V.58. 8 are identical. In Rg. V.57. 8 and 1617a V. 58. 8 it is the wind-gods (Maruts) that are addressed as kavayah (wise) and salyaśrutah (well-known as conferring true rewards) and not sages. VI. 49.6 (first half of which is addressed to Parjanya and Vāta-wind god) runs &lsquo;O esta blishers of the world! (O Maruts !) that are wise and well-known as conferring true rewards, make the world turn towards the man by whose lauds you are praised&rsquo; (this half seems to be addressed to the band of Maruts).

<li>The present author is aware that thousands of people look upon Sri Aurobindo as a yogin, a prophet and as a World Teacher. But the search for truth is higher than all propbets and yogios put togetber. Sri Aurobindo and his disciple claim that he has received a new revelation about the Veda beyond the ken of all scholars of antiquity and modern times and they have very severely haadled Yaska, Jaimini, Sāyaṇa and other commentators. The devotees and admirers of Sri Aurobindo must allow the same freedom to the critics of Sri Aurobindo&rsquo;s Vedic lacubrations for showing how and why they are wrong and are requested not to take umbrage at what tbo present writer bas said about his theories but only to reply to the aathor&rsquo;s brief criticismo on their merits or demerits,</li>

<p>Mimūnsd generalisation as to Veda</p>
<p>991</p>
<p>The Mimānsakas made &amp; sweeping generalisation that the whole Veda is meant for sacrifice. They went rather too far but they had substantial grounds for doing so. On pp. 980–982 of the H. of Dh. vol. II, it has been shown how even the Rgveda discloses that a complicated system of sacrifices with three savanas, numerous priests, three fires, existed in those far-off days and sacrifices like Atirātra (Rg. VII. 103.7) and Trikadruka (Rg. I. 32.3, II. 11. 17, VIII, 13, 18, VIII, 92. 21, X 14, 16) were being performed. The Mīmānsakas bad a long tradition behind them. But the case of Sri Aurobindo&rsquo;s theories is entirely different. On flimsy grounds and mistaken meanings he builds up an imposing structure of an exoteric and also an esoteric meaning of vedic mantras, propounds that the sages wanted secrecy for their doctrines and all that they were concerned with was Truth, Light and Conscious1888. It has been already shown that there are several philosophical and speculative hymns in the Rgveda, But there is no motive of secrecy therein. If it is only Truth, Light and Consciousness with which the vedio sages were concerned ten thousand verses would not have been necessary. One should like to know what secret or higher or deeper esoteric Truth or Light or Consciousness to be kept concealed from common men is contained in hymns such as Rg. VII. 55 ( sleeping charm), VII. 103 (maṇdāka-stuti), X. 34 (gambler&rsquo;s song), X. 119 (exhilaration of power of Soma od Indra), X 166 (invoking destruction of enemies), X. 190 (brief creation hymn), X. 191 (for concord and co-operation). Many more such hymns may be cited, where the theory of secrecy and Truth, Light and Consciousness would entirely fail. Besides, what is the secret (or spiritual or esoteric) element in such passages as those quoted above viz. I. 164. 46, X. 129.%, VIII. 58.2, which clearly express the most profound Truth. If the Mimāýsakas made a too wide generalization, Sri Aurobindo makes a far wider generalization with yory little basis.</p>
<p>The mantras of the Rgveda have a meaning and are not unmoaning letters as often in Tantrik works. There is a discus sion in Nirukta I 15–16 where it is said that in the absence of the Nirukta the apprehension of the meaning of the words used in mantras would not follow and the view of Kautsa is cited that the Nirukta is useless for understanding the meaning of mantras, since the mantras themselves have no sense (or are uselogs or purposeless ).

This emphasis on the conception of avatāras has greatly influenced the forms of religious worship, vratas and festivals. The subject of avatāras has been dealt with in the H. of Dh, vol. II, pp. 717-724. It has been shown there that the beginnings of the doctrine of avatāras and of some of the well-known avatāras may be traced to the Vedic Literature viz. to the Satapatha-Brāhmana (story of Manu and the fish in I. 8. 1. 1-6), story of Kurma (tortoise ) in Satapatha VII. 5. 1. 5, of Varaha (Boar) in Sat. Br. XIV. 1.2, 11, Vamana (Dwarf) in Sat. Br. I. 2. 5. 1 ff., Krspa, son of Devaki, in Chān. Up. II, 17. 6 and that the number of avatāras and the Dames also varied. But the treatment was not exhaustive and hence some details are added here from the Purāpas and from general considerations.</p>
<p>Avatāra (from root tṛ. with &lsquo;ava&rsquo;) means descending or descent' and the word is applied to gods, assuming the form of a human being or even of an animal and continuing to live in that form till the purpose for which that form was assumed was carried out. Reincarnation is one of the fundamental dootrines of Christianity. But there is a vast difference between that doctrine and the Hindu theory. Re-incarnation in Chris tianity is single and unique, while in the Hindu theory 28 adumbrated in the Gita (IV.5-8) and the Purāṇas there have been many incarnations of the Deity and there may he many more in future. It is a comforting belief for ordinary mon to hold that when the affairs of the world are in a mess God comes down to the earth to set matters right. And this belief is held not only by the Hindus and Buddhists but by many peoples (including some in the rich and educated West) far apart from each other. Most Hindus, however, do not believe that great</p>

<p>men, saints or prophets like Saṅkarācārya, Nānak, Shivaji or Mahatma Gandhi are born again as avatāras in times of crisis. The Buddhists made Buddha in their Mahāyāna teachings go through many avatāras as bodhisattva before he attained Buddha hood. In modern times many persons pose or are made to pose as avatāras by their admirers or followers. Recently, Mr. J. G. Bennett (Hodder and Stoughton, 1958) has published a book called &ldquo;Subud' (Sushila, Buddha, Dharma) in which he suggests his firm belief that one Pak Subuh who hails from Indonesia is an avatar, the messenger from above for whom mankind is waiting. The Indian theory of avatāras is connected with the theory about yugas and manyantaras. When the world is in gerious troubles people believe that deliverance will come by the grace of God and they are often justified in their belief by the appearance of godly. men who appear with some noble mission and masterly idea suited to the particular time and place when they appear,</p>
<p>In medieval and modern times the avatāras of Viṣṇu have been regarded as ten, viz. Matsya, Kūrma, Varāha, Nșsimha or Narasimha (Man-lion), Vāmana, Paraśurāma, Rama (son of Dasaratha), Krṣṇa, Buddha and Kalkin. The Varāha-purāṇa mentions these ton in that order.1619) In an inscription on the lintel above the figure of Saṅkara-Nārāyana in the Varāba Perumal 1620 temple, thia Paurāṇik verse except the first six letters (which cannot be read) is seen inscribed. The locus classicus about the descent of God in different formas is in the Bhagavad gita 1621 viz. &lsquo;Whenever piety or righteousness (dharma)</p>

The game idea occurs in some of the parvans of the Mahābhārata, as in Vanaparva 272.71 and Aśramedhika-parva 54. 13. None of the ten avatāras, except those of Krṣṇa and probably Rama, (&ldquo;Rāmaḥ sastrabhṛtām-ahaun', Gitā X. 31 ) are, however, men. tioned by Dame in the Bhagavad-gitā. The number and names of the avatāras are not uniform in the Mahābhārata. In the Nārdyapiya section of the Santiparva (chap. 339. verses 77-102) only six avatāras and their exploits are expressly mentioned, viz, Varaha (bringing up the earth submerged in the ocean), Narasimha (killing demon Hiraṇyakasipu ), Vāmana (van quishing Bali and making him dwell in Patāla), Bhargava Rama ( extirpating ksatriyas), Rāma, son of Dasaratha (killing Ravaṇa), Krṣṇa ( killing or vanquishing Kamsa, Narakasura, Bapa, Kalayavana, Jarāsandha, Siśupāla). Then the same chapter 1622 mentions ton avatāras as follows: Hamsa, Kūrma, Matsya, Varaha, Narasimha, Vamana, Rāma (Bhargava), Rāma Dasarathi, Sātvata, Kalki. Here Buddha is omitted and Kṭspa is called Sātvata and Hamsa is added. In the Harivarsa 1623 it is said that the past avatāras have been thousands and in future also they would be thousands. Santiparva says the same thing. The Harivamsa (I. 41. 27 ff) Dames only the following and their exploits, viz. Varāba, Narasimha, Vāmana, Dattatreya, Jāmadagnya (Parasurama), Rāma, Kroṇa and Vedavyasa, But as Kośava is said to be the 9th (I. 41.6) it is to be under stood that Matsya and Kūrma were counted, though not expressly named and Kalki Viṣpuyabas is mentioned as a</p>

The usual ton avatāras are named in Vardha 1634 (4. %, 48. 17-22, 55. 36-37), Mataya' 285. 6-7, Agni (ohap. 2-16 stories about all ton), Narasimhapurdna (chap. 36), Padma VI. 43. 13-15). In Vayu 98. 68-104 the text presents the avatāras in a confused manner and appears to mention ton avatāras, viz. Varāha, Narasimha, Vāmana, Dattatreya, Māndhātę, Jāmadagnya, Rama ( Dasarathi), Veda-vyāsa, Vasu deva, Kalkin Vispuyaśas. In Brahminda III. 73.75 # thote are lists of avatāras different from the present ten. In the Bhagavata the avatāras of Viṣnu are mentioned in several places. In I. 3. 1-25 twenty-two avatāras including Brahma, Dovarṣi Nārada (who promulgated the Satvata system), Nara Nārāyana, Kapila ( who taught to Asuri the Saṅkhya system ), Dattatreya, Rsabha, (son of Nabhi and Merudeyi),1625 Dhanvan tari, Mohini, Vedavyāga, Balarāma and Kṛspa, Buddha, Kalki are mentioned. In II. 7 twenty-three avatāras are mentioned, many of which are the same as in I. 3, but in II. 7 Dhruva, Pythu son of Vena, Hayagriva are mentioned, the first two of which are mentioned as avatāras hardly anywhere else. In Bhāgavata XI, 40. 17-22 the following avatāras are mentioned, viz. Matsya, Hayasirsa, Kūrma, Sūkara, Narasimha, Vāmana, Bhargava Rāma, Rāma, Vāsudeva, Saṅkarṣaṇa, Pradyumna, Aniruddha, Buddha, Kalki. In Bhagavata XL 4. 17-22 sixteen avatāras are set out, viz. usual ten plus Hamsa, Datta (Dattātreya), Kumāra (Nārada), Reabha, Vyāsa and Hayagriva. Twelve avatāras are noted in Matsya 99. 14 and Padma V. 13. 182-186. The Prapancasāratantra (ascribed to the great advaita teacher Saṅkarācārya) mentions ( in Patala 20. 59 ) Matsya, Kūrma, Varāha, Nșsimha, Kubja (i. e. Vamana), three Ramas</p>

<p>The passage of Matsya ( 285. 6–7) is very likely a later loter polation, because in another place in the Matsya, the names of avatāras are different. In Mataya 47. 106 there is a reference to the curse on Viggo by Bhrga that since Viṣgu kūled his wife he would have to be bora seven times as a human being and the seven avatāras are Dattatreya, Māndbāta, Jāmadagoya (Bhargava) Rama, Rāma Dāśarathi, Vedavyāsa, Baddba, Kalkio and three more (io 47, 237&ndash;240 ), viz.

<p>(i.e. Bhārgavarama, Dāśarathi Rama and Balarama), Krona and Kalkin (i. e. it omits Buddha). The Ahirbudhnya Samhita (5. 50-57) enumerates 39 avatāras of Vasudeva, that are set out by Otto Schrader in his Introduction to the Panoarātra and the Ahirbudhnya Samhita, pp. 42-43. The Viṣnupurāna 1626 states that Lakṣmi follows Visṇu in his avatāras. The Purānas are full of the descriptions of the exploits of Visnu in his several avatāras. But it should not be supposed that Siva had no ayatāras. The Vāyu (chap. 23) mentions 28 avatārag of Maheśvara the last of which was Nakuli (Lakuli) as verse 221 gays. In Varaha 15. 10-19 all avatāras are praised except that of Buddha. But Varāba ( 48, 20-22) provides that worship of Narasimha frees men from the fear of sins, of Vamana leads to removal of delusion, of Parasurama to wealth, one should worship Dāśarathi Rama for the destruction of cruel enemies, one desirous of a son should worship Balarama and Kșsna, one who desires a handsome form should worship Buddha and one should worship Kalkin for the slaughter of enemies 1627 The Agnipurāṇa (chap. 49. 1-9) describes what characteristics the images of the ten avatāras should possess and says that the image of Buddha should be represented as having a quiet face, long ear-lobes, fair complexion, wearing an upper garment, seated in Padmāsana posture and his hands should have the varada and abhaya poses.</p>
<p>From the facts that Kṣemendra in his Dasavatāra-carita 1628 (composed in 1066 A, D.), and the Gitagovinda of Jayadeva (court poet of Laksmanasena) mention the ugual ton avatāras with Fish as the first and that the Matsya passage about ten avatāras is quoted by Aparārka (first half of 12th century), it follows that all the ten avatāras of Visṇu had become recognised throughout India at least about the 10th century A.

<p>Avatāras in Purānas and Inscriptions &amp;c.</p>

<p>Kumārila (7th century A. D.) did not accept Buddha as an avatāra, though about that contury some people had come to recognize him as such (vide note 1629). Besides, as shown above, there were many views about the total number of avatāras, their names and the order in which they appeared. Vide Dr. Katre&rsquo;s paper in Allahabad University Studies, vol. X. pp. 37–130 for discussion on 33 avatāras. The Varāba avatāra is mentioned in the Eran stone Boar 1629 Inscription of Toramāṇa (Gupta inscriptions pp. 158-160) in the first quarter of the 6th century. The Raghuvansa (IV. 53 and 58 ) refers to the recovery of land near the Sahya mountain from the Western Sea by Rāma (Bhargava); vide pp. 89-90 and note 224 above for references in the Mahabharata and Purāpas to Paraśurāma&rsquo;s exploits. The Sarvānukramani p. 42 on Rg. X, 110 names as ļṣi Jamadagni or his son Rāma The Meghadūta mentions the planting of the left foot of Viṣṇu on Bali (i.e. the Vamana avatāra). Magha in Sisupala-vadha (XV. 58) regards Bodhisattva (Buddha) as an avatāra of Hari and as sought to be tempted by the hordes of Māra. Māgha 1630 flourished about 725-775 A. D. The know ledge of Vamana and Krsna avatāras can be carried back centuries before the Mahābhāsya of Patañjali, since it refers to works and dramatic representations of the imprisonment of Bali and the killing of Kamsa (vide pp. 130, 203 and notes 330, 521 above). In the Daśāvatāra cave at Ellora one sees the repre sentations of Varāha, Narasimha, Vāmana and Krsna. Those caves are ascribed to the 8th century A. D.1631 Therefore, it appears almost certain that some at least ( viz. Vamana, Parasu rāma and Krsna) of the usual ton avatāras had been recognised some centuries before Christ and all ten had come to be recognised by some writers and other people before the 7th century A.

<p>The conception of avatāras contributed largely to the increase of Dharmaśāstra material. They gave rise to numerous vratas and festivals. For example, the Varāhapurāpa devotes chaptera 39-48 to dvādaśi-vratas in honour of the ton avatāras from Matsya to Kalkin. There are separate festivals called Jayantis of the avatāras such as Narasimha-jayanti on Vaisakha śu. 14, Paraśurāma jayanti ( on Vaiśākha su. 3). Vide pp. 262 263 for the tithis and months in which the different avatāras appeared. 16316</p>
<p>Descriptions of each of the ten well-known avatūras occur in several Purāṇas; for example, Matsya avatāra is described in Matsya chap. 1-2, Agni 2, Narasimua 37; Kūrma in Agni 3, Bhāgavata I. 3. 16, VIII. 7-8-10, Narasimha 38; Varāba in Matsya 247-248, Vāyu 6. 11–26, Bhāgavata III. 13. 18-45, III. 19. 25-30, Narasimha 39; Narasimha avatara in Brahma 58. 12 ff., 213.43 ff., Matsya 161-163, Bhāgavata I. 3. 18, VII. 8. 18, Narasimha-purāṇa 41-44; Vimana in Brahma 73 and 213. 80-185, Vāgu 98, 74-87, Vāmanapurāṇa 78.51, Bhagavata VIII. 18. 12 to VIII, 22. 33, Narasimla 45; Parasurama in Matsya 244–246, Bhagavata IX, 15. 13, IX, 16. 1-26 and vide above pp. 89-90 and note 204; Rāma in Brahma 176, Agni 5-11 (the seven kāndas of the Rāmāyaṇa are summarised), Vāyu 88. 183 198, Bhag.

Vaidya in the Ganga Oriental Series probably contains the longest account of the ton avatāras (pp. 39-386 ).

The most exhaustive treatment of what may be called political matters is found in Matsya chap. 215-226 and 240, Agni 218–242, Viṣnudharmottara II. chap. 2-7, 18-21, 24-26, 28, 61-63, 66–72, 145–152, 177. Among other Purāṇas Garuda I. 108-115, Mārkandeya 24 (in Venk. od, or 27 in Bagerji&rsquo;s ed.), Kālikā 87 contain some discussion of matters political. It should be noticed that both Matsya ( 240.2) and Agni (228.1) employ the two technical words, &lsquo;Akranda&rsquo; and &lsquo;Pārspigrāha&rsquo; that are part of the theory of Mandala in Kautilya (VI. 2. p. 260) explained in H. of Dh. vol. III. p. 222. The Matsyapurāna is profusely quoted by one of the earliest extant digests on Dharmaśāstra viz. the Kṛty&amp; kalpataru on Rājadharma (pp. 23, 25-30, 34-38, 42–43, 55-61, 118-122, 123–124, 158-161 and many verses from chap. 227 and 241 of the Matsya on the administration of justice in Vyavahāra kānda pp. 342, 345, 348, 377, 406, 409-10, 562, 581, 594-95, 599). The same digest quotes many verses (pp. 9–13, 128, 166, 178-181) from the Brahmapurāṇa which are not found in the printed Brahma (Ādan, ed.), but which are quoted by the Rājanīti. prakāśa of Mitramiśra (borrowing from Krtyakalpataru) pp. 138, 158, 283, 416-419 and some by the Rājadharmakaustubha of Anantadova (pp. 326–330). The Viṣnudharmottara on rājadharma is not quoted in the Kṛtyakalpataru on rajadharma, but it is frequently quoted by the Rājanītiprakāśa e. g. Vi. Dh. II. 18.1, 5-14 are quoted by R. N. P. on pp. 32-33, Vi. Dh. II. 18. 2-4 are quoted by R. N. P. p. 61, Vi. Dh. II, 22. 1-185 are quoted by R. N. P. pp. 66-81 (on mantras to be recited and the several divinities to be invoked at a king&rsquo;s coronation), Vi, Dh. II. 23. 1-13 are quoted by R. N. P. on pp. 82-83 (describing the towards of the mantras recited in Vi. Dh. II. 22). Vi. Dh. is quoted 21 times by the Rajadharma-kaustubha. These three Purāṇas alone (Mataya, Agni, Viṣoudharmottara ) devote several thousand verses to the topic of rāja-dharma and allied matters. The Garuda-purāṇa (I. 108-115) devotes about four hundred yerges to Rājansti (political thought) but many of them are like subhāṣitas (bon mots) and are borrowed from Manu (e. g. Garuda I. 109. 1 and 52, 110.7, 115 63 are respectively Manu VII, 213, VIII. 26, II, 239, IX. 3), the Mahābhārata, the Nāradasmrti (e. g. &lsquo;na sā sabhā&rsquo; in Garuda 115.52 is Nārada III. 18), The Garuda itself states that it will expound the essence of niti (Rajadharma) based upon Artham</p>

One verse is almost the same as the Introduotory verse 5 of Bāṇa&rsquo;s Kadambari 1633 and I am disposed to hold that it is the Garuda that is the borrower.</p>
<p>Certain verses from the Mārkandeya-purāṇa (24. 5, 23-33 or chap. 27 and 21-31 in Banerji&rsquo;s ed.) are quoted by R. N. P. pp. 30-31 ( about the duties of kings and their acting in the peculiar ways of five gods, viz. Indra, Sūrya, Yama, Soma and Vāyu). The Dāyabhāga quotes the Markandeya-purāṇa for pointing out that sāpindya in the matter of inheritance and succession is different from sāpiṇdya for the periods of aśauca ( impurity on death 1634). The Kṛtyakalpataru on Rājadharma (pp. 182-183 ) quotes a passage from Skandapurāṇa on the festival of Kaumudimahotsava to be celebrated by the king.</p>
<p>The same passage is quoted by R. N. P. pp. 419-421.</p>
<p>The Krtyakalpataru (on Rāja dharma) quotes a long passage (pp. 201-212) from Bhaviṣyapurāṇa on. Vasordhārā', which is quoted by the R.N.P. (pp. 447-457 ) from the Devipurāṇa. The Kālikāpurāpa in chapter 87 dovotos 131 verses to Rājaniti, in which a summary is furnished of the course of conduct that should be followed by the king. This chapter expressly mentions the works of Uśanas and Bphaspati (verses 99 and 130) and advises the king to honour brāhmaṇas that are advanced in knowledge, learning, tapas and age, to control his senses, to employ the four upāyas ( sāma, dāna, danda and bheda ), to avoid the vices of gambling, drinking, indulgence in sexual matters and hunting, to practise the six guṇas ( yāna, āsana &amp;c. ), to test the princes, councillors, the queens and other female relatives by upadhās ( investigation of character by various trioks) 1635</p>

<p>History of Dharmasāstra (Sec. V, Oh. XXIV</p>
<p>. It appears that Kautilya&rsquo;s Arthaśāstra was not available to most medieval writers and therefore they relied on the purāṇas for the treatment of Rajadharma. But the early Puranas like the Matsya appear to have made use of Kautilya&rsquo;s work. Vide the author&rsquo;s paper on &lsquo;Kautilya and the Matsya-purāṇa&rsquo; in Dr. B. C. Law presentation volume II. pp. 13-15.</p>
<p>In the matter of the administration of justice and the law of SUCCession and inheritance also some of the Purānas have influenced the views of writers of nibandhas. The Krtya kalpataru on Vyavahāra quotes about twelve verses from the Kālikā-purāṇa on the marks of a truthful party or witness and on the appropriate ordeals in the case of the several varnas, 1636 their procedure and the different causes of action (vide pp. 79, 205, 210, 211, 221, 231, 238). Three verses from the Kālikā (chap. 91. 35-37) about the twelve kinds of sons and the impro priety of making a punarbhava, svayandatta and a dāsa successor to a kingdom are quoted in the R. N. P. pp. 35 and 42. Verges 38-41 of Kālikā, chapter 91, about the sons that can be adopted and the age up to which they can be adopted are quoted by the Dattakamimamsā p. 60 ( Ānan. ed.) and by the Vyava haramayūkba p. 114, though the latter remarks that they were not found in two or three mss. of the Purāna, 1637 In connection with the question of the seniority among twing the Mayakha quotes Sridhara&rsquo;s comment on Bhāgavata (III. 19. 18) that the son born first is the younger one; but the Vyavahāramayūkha1638 makes the interesting remark that in the Purāṇas practices opposed to the smrtis are frequently soon.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XXV</p>
<p>Causes of the Disappearance of Buddhism from India.</p>
<p>At the beginning of Chapter XXIV (pp. 913-14, n 1448) above, it was stated that the Purānas had a large share in bringing about the final disappearance of Buddhism from India, the land of its birth. The disappearance of Buddhism from India was complete and seemed to be sudden and is a com plex problem. No single cause, nor even a few causes oan fully account for this phenomenon. A combination of causes, both internal and external, must have been in operation for a pretty long time to bring about this remarkable event. It may be admitted that some of the causes are more or less conjectural. In the first quarter of the 5th century A. D. Fa-Hian found Buddhism in a flourishing condition in India, while in the first half of the 7th century A.D. Yuan Chwang appears to say that the decline of Buddhism had set in. It-sing found Buddhism very much on the decline in the beginning of the 8th century A.D. An attempt will be made here to discuss briefly the goveral causes that have been put forward by scholars for explaining the almost total disappearance of Buddhism from India. A few of the contributions bearing on this subjeot may be noted here. &lsquo;Religions of India&rsquo; by A. Barth, translated by J. Wood (1882) pp. 133-139; Journal of Pali Texts Society (1896 pp. 87-92) on *Persecution of Buddhists in India&rsquo; by Rhys Davids; Kern&rsquo;s &lsquo;Manual of Buddhism&rsquo;(in the German Grundriss pp. 133-134);</p>

<p>Before Simion from India D</p>
<p>r eat reform</p>
<p>Before setting out the main causes of the virtual disappear ance of Buddhism from India certain gonoral points have to be emphasized. Buddha was only a great reformer of the Hindu religion as practised in his time. He did not feel or claim that he was forming a new religion, nor did he renounce the Hindu religion and all its practices and beliefs. The Buddha referred to the Vedas and Hindu sages with honour in some of his sermons. He recognised the importance of Yogic practices and meditation. His teaching took over several beliefs current among the Hindus in his day such as the doctrine of Karma and Rebirth and cosmological theories. A substantial portion of the teaching of Buddha formed part of the tenets of the Upanisadio period. At the time when he was born there were two main currents of thoughts and practices prevalent among the people, one being the path of sacrifices to Gods and the other being the path of moral endeavour, self-restraint and spiritual goal. It has been shown above (pp. 917-918) how the Upaniṣads assigned a lower position to the Vedas and the sacrifices enjoined therein and how spiritual knowledge after cultivating high ethical qualities was deemed greater than sacrifices. The Upaniṣads first began by symbolical interpretation of Vedic sacrifices, as for example in Bṛ. Up. I. 1. 1, where Uṣas, Sūrya and Samvatsara are said to be respectively the head, the eye and the soul of the sacrificial horse or as in Chān. Up II. 2. 1-%, where the five parts of the Sāman employed in a sacrifice are aymbolically identified with earth, fire, sky, sun and heaven. Then they proceed to belittle the Veda as mere name and as much inferior to brahmaridyā (e. g. Br. Up. IV. 4. 21, I. 4.10, Chān. Up. VII. 1-4, Mundaka I. 1. 4-5. It is generally held by all Sanskrit scholan that at least the oldest Upaniṣads like the Bșhada ranyaka and the Chandogya are earlier than Buddha, that they do not refer to Buddha or to his teachings or to the pitakas. On the other hand, though in dozens of Suttas meetings of brāhmaṇas and Buddha or his disciples and missionaries are reported they almost always seem to be marked by courtesy on both sides. No meetings are recorded in the early Pali Texts or brahmanical Texts about Sākyans condemning the tenets of ancient brahma nism or about brāhmaṇas censuring the Bauddha heterodoxy. Besides, in all those meetings and talks, the central Upaniṣad conception of the immanence of brahma is never attacked by Buddha or by the early propagators of Buddhism. What Buddha says may be briefly rendered as follows: &ldquo;Even so have 1, O Bhikkhus, seen an ancient path, an ancient road followed by</p>
<p>Buddha proclaimed only an ancient path</p>
<p>1005</p>
<p>rightly enlightened persons of former times. And what, O Bhikkhus, is that ancient path, that ancient road, followed by the rightly enlightened ones of former times? Just this very Noble Eightfold Path, viz. right views&hellip;&amp;o. This, O Bhikkhus, is that ancient path, that ancient road, followed by the rightly enlightened ones of former times. Along that (path) I have gone and while going along that path, I have fully come to know, old age and death. Having come to know it fully, I have told it to the monks, the nuns, the lay followers, men and women; this brahmacarya is prosperous, flourishing, widespread, widely known, has become popular and made manifest well by gods and men.&ldquo;1639 It will be noticed that the Noble Eightfold Path which the Buddha put forward as the one that would put an end to misery and suffering is here expressly stated to be an ancient path trod by ancient enlightened men. Buddha does not claim that he was unique, but claimed that he was only one of a series of Enlightened men and stressed that the moral qualities which he urged men to cultivate belonged to antiquity. In the Dhamma pada and the Suttanipāta (Mahāvagga, Vāsottha sutta) the truly virtuous man is spoken of as brābmana: &ldquo;I speak of him as brāhmaṇa, who causes no harm (or evil) in body, word and thought, who is guarded as regards these three SOUTCON&rdquo;; neither by matted hair nor by lineage, nor by caste, does one become a brahmana'; &lsquo;that man in whom there is truth and righteousness is blessed and is a brāhmana&rsquo;; &lsquo;him who does not cling to desires (or pleasures) as water does not stick to a lotus leaf or as a mustard grain (does not stiok) on the top of an awl, I call a brāhmana. &lsquo;1640 Moreover, it does not appear that at any time</p>

<p>History of Dharmaśāstra (Sec. V. Ch. XXV</p>
<p>the whole of India or even large portions of it were completely Buddhistio. The people of India as a whole were always Hindus. 1641. There were many millions of people at all times who professed Hinduism and not Buddhism. Besides, even when Buddhism secured the patronage of emperors like Asoka, Kaniska and Harṣa Buddhism was mainly restricted to mons steries and schools and great tolerance prevailed. For example, Harṣa&rsquo;s father was a great devotee of the Sun and he himself is described in his Banskhera and Madhuban plates as a great devotee of Siva, though his elder brother Rājyavardhana is described as parumasaugata (a great devotee of Buddha) and he appears to have shown favour to the Buddhist pilgrim (Yuan Chwang ),1642</p>
<p>Some recent authors like Prof. K. W. Morgan hold that the most important causes of the disappearance of Buddhism were decline of vigour in the Sangha, the Moslem invasions and the opposition of the Hindu community (&ldquo;The Path of the Buddha&rsquo; p. 48).</p>

<p>the two or to say in what respects Buddhism is really unortho doz (vide his &lsquo;Hinduism and Buddhism&rsquo; p: 452). Buddha and his successors really attacked some popular varieties of Brahma. nism. Mrs. Rhys Davids in her lecture on The relations between Early Buddhism and Brahmanism&rsquo; (published in I. H.Q. Vol. X. pp. 274-286) endeavours to show that the Tripitakas do not refer to rupture with brāhmaṇas and that what Buddha proached was in agreement with the central tonet of immanonce in the Brahmanism of the day. Buddha agreed (or at least had no quarrel) with the Upaniṣad teaching about high moral endeavour being a necessary pre-requisite for brahma realization and mokṣa (as in Bṛ. Up. IV. 4. 23 &lsquo;tasmād-evamvic.chānto dānta upratas-titikṣuḥ samāhito bhūtyā ātmanyevātmānam paśyati&rsquo;, Katha Up. I. 2. 23, 1. 3, 8, 9, 13, 15, Praśna Up. I. 15–16, Mundaka 1. 2. 12-13).</p>
<p>The main matters of controversy between Buddha and the Hindu religious and philosophical system current in his time are generally held to bave been caste divisions and pride of caste, the absolute authoritativeness of the Vedas and the great importance attached to sacrifices. 1642a Buddha asserted that righteousness and wisdom were the best, he did not expressly deny the existence of God but proclaimed that it was unnecessary to be definite nor did he pronounce his definite views on such questions as whether the world is eternal or non-eternal, since according to him, to cogitate on such points would be &quot; a thicket of theorizing, wilderness of theorizing, the tangle of theorizing, the bondage and shackles of theorizing &hellip;&hellip; nor would it conduce to aversion, passionlessness, tranquillity, peace, illumination and nirvania.&rdquo; 1643 Buddha did not think much</p>
<p>1642 a. Barth in &lsquo;Religions of India&rsquo; (pp. 125-126 ) scouts the theory that the institution of the Sangha and primitive Buddhism were a reaction against the regime of caste and the spiritual yoke of the brahmanas and calls that theory &lsquo;a fiction of romance.&rsquo;</p>

<p>of worship or prayer. Acoording to him, what mattered was the deliverance of man from BOITOW and suffering and the attainment of nirvana 1613 ( which state he did not care to define clearly and precisely). The original doctrine (called hinayāna,</p>
<p>the lesser way or vehicle&rsquo;) held that the experience of enlighten ment and nirvana can be secured by human beings in this very</p>
<p>life if they follow the path chalked out by Buddha.</p>
<p>The causes that have been advanced from time to time by scholars for the total disappearance of Buddhism from India must now be dealt with, (1) Persecution is alleged by some scholars as at least one of the main causes. King Pusyamitra of the Sunga dynasty is charged with having proclaimed that whoever would bring to him the head of a śramanu would receive one hundred dināras; 1644 Mihirakula, king of Kashmir,</p>
<p>1643 a. The word ' Nirvana ' literally means &lsquo;blown out, extinguished, or become cooled&rsquo;. Takiog the view most favourable to Buddha&rsquo;s teaching, it implies the blowing out or extinction of the fires of kama (lust or desire). krodha (aoger or ill-will), moha (ignorance or stupidity) and transfor mation of these into moral purity, goodwill (or charity ) aad wisdom. It is not like the Biblical Heaven. It is a state of perfect enlightenment, peace and bliss, attainable not merely after death, but in this very life and on this earth. It is really indescribable as stated in the Pali Udāga, VIII &ldquo;un. become, unborn, unformed &amp;c. ' and resembles the words used in speaking of brahma as&rsquo; aeti neti' in Bṭ. Up.

This seems to be a palpably absurd legend, No king in ancient India, much lesa one called Sadbanvā, ruled over the vast territory from the Himalayas to Rānesvara. Further, it may be noted that the order, supposing one was issued, was addressed only to the king&rsquo;s servants and not to one and all. The Saṅkaradigvijaya (XV. 1) states that when Saṅkarācārya started on a pilgrimage to Rāneśvara king Sodbanvan accompanied him. Madhava cārya, being blinded by his zeal to glorify his hero to the utmost, goes og heaping one legeod on another and casts all history and chronology to the wiods. For example, he narrates that Acārya Abhinavagupta (a great Saiva and Taotrika teacher) was vanqoished by Saṅkara la disputations (XV. 158) and that Abhinavagupta practised black magic against the great Acārya. From Abbioavagupta&rsquo;s own works it appears that bis literary activity lay between 980 to 1020 A. D. (vide the author&rsquo;s History of Sanskrit Poetics', 1951, pp. 231-232), while no scholar woold place Saṅkarācārya later than 800 A. D. Mādbavācārya also says (XV. 137 ) that Saṅkara vanquisbed by his arguments Sriharja, author of Khagdanakhaqda. khadya, who could not be vanquisbed by Guru, Bhatta and Udayanı.

<p>downwards and that India never indulged in persecution in anyway approaching to the persecution of reforming Ohristiana by the orthodox Church or the persecution of Christians by the Roman authorities. Dr. R. O. Mitra in &ldquo;Decline of Buddhism in India&rdquo; (pp. 125–130) arrives at the same conclusion about the cases of persecution. Barth (in &lsquo;Religions of India&rsquo; p. 136) admits that everything tends to prove that Buddhism became extinct from sheer exhaustion and that it is in its own inherent defects that we must seek for the causes of its disappearance. He prefaces this remark with the words &lsquo;the most reliable documents, coins and inscriptions, bear evidence of a tolerance exceptionally generous on the part of the civil powers&rsquo; (p. 133) and illustrates this by examples. 16458 It should be noted that great Smrtikāras like Yājñavalkya laid down that when an Indian king reduced a kingdom to subjection, it was the conqueror&rsquo;s duty to honour the usages, the transactions and family tradi tions of the conquered country and to protect them.

But such cases are very few and their very paucity emphasizes and illuminates the great religious tolerance of the Indian people for more than two thousand years. One interesting instance is found in an inscription from Ablur published in E. I. vol. V pp. 213 ff ( et p. 243 ), where the story is told of an intense devotee of Saivism named Ekāntada Rāma, who, in a controversy with the Jainas of Huligere ( Lakṣmeśvara ) led by a village headman gamed Saṅkagaudā made a wager in a writing on palmyra leaf to the effect that he would cat his own head, place it at the feet of Somanātha in Huligere and have the head rostored after seven days and that, if he succeeded, the Jains were to give up their faith and God, Ekantada Rāma succeeded, but the Jainas refused to destroy the image of Jina, whereupon Rāma routed the horses and guards sent by the Jaidas, laid waste the Jaina shrine and built a big sira shrine there. The Jaigas complaioed to king Bijjala who sent for Rāma and questioned him. Rāma produced the writing containing the terms of the wager, but offered to perform the same feat. The Jainas were not prepared to face the same test again. Bijjala asked the Jainas to live peaceably with their neighbours, gave a jayapatra (document of Rāma&rsquo;s success) and granted a village to the temple of Somapatha. It is clear that a Jain image was overthrown and a Saiva one was substituted by Rāma (leaving aside the superhuman feat ascribed to him ). Rāma is to be placed shortly boforo 1162 A, D. There is a great difference between local brawls as in the above case and a general policy by a community or a king of wholesale persecution.</p>

India has been for thousands of years &amp; country of nearly absolute tolerance, which is literally a religion, while European religiosity has nearly always been intolerant and, when not intolerant, it is tantamount to mental hostility or complete indifference. Most Indian religious people were and are ready to agree that there may be alternative approaches to the mystery of life and the salvation of the soul. Indians feel amused at the claims of millions of people that some prophet rovered by them has got the monopoly of the knowledge of God and the Hero after. This tolerance for differing tenets and cults persisted in India with rare exceptions throughout the long stretch of time from centuries before Asoka onwards till about 1200 A. D. when Moslems overran India. A few striking instances (both early and late ) may be cited here: (1) Khāravela again, &amp; Jain king of Kalinga (2nd or 1st century B.C.), granted freedom from taxation to brāhmaṇas in the 9th year of his reigo (E.

<p>General tolerance for all faiths in India</p>
<p>2015</p>
<p>The above examples show that in all parts of India in the North as well as in the South, the general rule among kings and their officers was tolerance and care for all faiths. If there was rarely some persecution it was by an individual king or officer or the like. On the other hand, though Asoka, ag an inheritor of the Indian royal tradition of showing honour and respect to all faiths of the subjects irrespective of his own religious views, breathes &amp; striking spirit of tolerance in his 7th and 12th Rock ediots, one cannot help &amp; suspicion that in the later part of his life he seems to gloat over the fact that the gods worshipped as divinities in Jambudyipa had been rendered false and he proudly proclaims that this result is &lsquo;not the effect of my greatness but of my zoal&rsquo;.</p>

<p>It should be noted that even Asoka&rsquo;s ahimsā was at first not thorough-going but qualified. In his first Rock Edict he himself states that in his royal kitohen thousands of animals were killed, but that he had reduced the slaughter to two peacocks a day and one deer (that too rarely) and that even the three animals would not be killed in future (vide C. II. vol. I pp 1-2). Whether this last promise was really carried out is not clear. Besides, Asoka appears to have carried his solicitude for the protection of all life too far and used against buman beings his absolute power like a dictator. In the 4th Delhi Topra Pillar edict (O. I. I., vol. I p. 124) he mentions that his revenue settlement officers called Lajūkas had to deal with many hundred thousands of men and were given the discretion to award punishments including the death sentence and that a respite of three days was allowed in which the relatives of the man condemned to death could persuade the lajūkas to grant reprieves. In the fifth Delhi-Topra pillar edict (ibid. pp 125-128), after 26 years of his being anointed he declared that 23 kinds of birds and other animals (such as parrots, mainas, ruddy and wild geese, doves, certain kinds of fish, tortoises) were not to be killed at all, that owes and sows that were with young or were in milk or the young of these that were less than six months old were also not to be killed; he also forbade the sale of fish on certain Hull Moon days and the days previous to them and following them, the oastration of bulls, rams, horses on 8th, 14th and 15th days of a month and the branding of horses and bulls on Puṣya and Punarvasu and on oāturmāsis.

There are some gaps and mistakes in these and it is got clear what is meant. Probably the sentence in these latter may be rendered &lsquo;Daring that time men that were true or, if we take amissa as equal to amiśra that were not mixed with gods&rsquo;) became false (or, became mixed with gods'). The words from HF onwards mean this is the result of zeal; it cannot be attained by greatness ( by one occapylag a merely bigb position); even for a small person it is possible to reach heaven by zeal.' Mr. Ramchandra Dikshitar ia Prof. Rangaswami Aiyaagar Presentation volume pp. 25-30 argues that Asoka was a Hindu as be refers to &lsquo;Svarga&rsquo;. This is not correct, since the edict itself recites that Asoka had been a lay follower of Buddha for more than 21 years before the date of the edict and that for more than a year before it be approached the community of monks aod became a zealous Boddhist (or probably a monk ). Even early Pali works speak of Gods from heaven coming to pay respect to Buddba. So the mere mention of svarga means little, Asoka does aot appear to bave been trained in the sacred Pali books if any existed. He hardly ever mentions nirvāṇa, never mentions (aadamental tenets of early Buddhism (in all his numerous edicts) like the Four Noble Truths or the Noble Eight-fold Path or Pratitya-samatpāda. He was probably attracted by Buddha&rsquo;s teachings on moral endeavour and subscribed to them and disliked Bacrifices. He appears to bave bolieved in gods and desired that the people should strive for heaven (vide 6th Rock edict at Giroar ' pret IT47' and similar words in the 10th Rock edict).

<p>worship of gods and probably resorted to coercive measuros in that direction. This very inscription is edited at O. I. I., Vol. I. pp. 166 by Dr. Hultzsch and the translation of the important sentence is changed and is given as &lsquo;And those gods who during that time had been unmingled with men in Jambudvipa have now been made (by me) mingled with them; for this is the fruit of zeal&rsquo;. This new translation cannot be understood as it stands and on p. 168 (note 3) Hultzsch admits that this sentence is enigmatical and tries to show that it refers to religious shows at which effigies of gods were shown in order to convey to the subjects that they would be able to reach the abodes of gods by the zealous practice of Buddha&rsquo;s Dhamma. This interpretation is extremely far-fetched and does not fit into the context. How can the more showing of exhibi tions and their effect on people be regarded as the reward of zeal? Besides, in the very first rock edict he forbids assemblies or festival meetings (O. I. I. vol. I p. 1&rsquo;na ca samājo kattavyo) except such as were regarded good by Asoka and asserts that the king sees great evil in festival meetings. Asoka probably followed what Āp. Dh. S. L 11. 32. 19 provides for Vodic house holders &lsquo;sabhāḥ samājāmāca&rsquo; (varjayet), sabhā meaning &lsquo;gambling hall&rsquo;. The author is not satisfied with the translation of Hultzsch, particularly when Bühler and Sonart (pp. 168 note) agreed as to the meaning of the important sentence about</p>

<p>About Emperor Harsa also Yuan Chwang narrates that he caused the use of animal food to cease throughout the five Indies and he prohibited the taking of life under severe penalties (vide Watters' work cited above p. 344).

Smith (4th ed. of 1924 pp. 303-304), where the historian further points out that when Yuan Obwang visited Bodh Gaya, that convent was a magni ficent establishment occupied by a thousand monks. One Muhammad Ufi relates an anecdote. Though Mahomed of Gazni plundered Kathiawad and Gujarat several times and desecrated temples, the Hindus inade a distinction between such invading and destructive marauders and peaceful Muslime residing in Gujarat for trade. Some Hindus at Cambay, being incited by Bome Parsis, destroyed a mosque and killed some Muslims. Ono Muslim that escaped approached the king Siddharāja with &amp; petition. The king in disguise inquired into the matter, punished the offenders, gave to the Moslems one lakh of Balotras to rebuild the mosque and presented to the Khatib four articles of dress which were preserved in the mosque. Ufi declares that he never heard a story comparable to this. Vide Elliotts' History of India, Vol. II pp. 162-163. The Somanath-Pattan Inscription (in I. A. Vol. XI p. 241) is &amp; most remarkable document. A Muslim ship-owner from Hormuz acquired a piece of land in the sacred town of Somanath-pattan, built a mosque, a house &lsquo;and shops thereon. The purpose of the grant was to confirm the purchase and to provide for the application of the income from the shops for particular Moslem religious festivals to be cele brated by the Shia sailors of Somanath and to provide that the surplus left, if any, was to be made over to the sacred towns of Mecca and Medina. It is dated in four eras, first in Rasul Mahammad sancat i. e. Hijra year 662, then Vikrama samint 1320 (1264 A. D.), Valabhi year 945 and Simha samyat 151 (i.e. probably of Calukya Siddharāja Jayasimha ). Syrian Christians were given special privileges by generous Hindu rulers in South India.</p>
<p>The above examples will indicate what tolerance was practised by Indian kings and people even in the mediaeval period when Moslem invaders were ruthlessly attacking India. The reader should visualise to himself what the fate of a Hindu would have been, if he had the audacity to build a temple in Christian or Moslem countries or tried to collect materials forIntolerance of moslem kings</p>

<p>How intolerant most Moslem kings were need not be dwelt upon at length. A few typical examples may be cited from the Cambridge History of India, vol. III. Firuz Shah Tughlak burnt a brāhmaṇa who tried to propagate his religion (ibid. p. 187); Sikander Lodi did the same (ibid. p. 246) to a brahmana and was guilty of wholesale destruction of Hindu temples; Sultan Sikandar of Kashmir offered his subjects the choice between Islam and exile (ibid p. 280); Hussein Shah of Bengal sent an army to destroy Navadvipa and converted many brāhmaṇas forcibly. Jehangir says in his ‘Memoirs (translated by A. Rogers and edited by H. Beveridge, 1909 pp. 72–73) that he killed Guru Arjun for his religious activities. Vide History of Aurangzeb&rsquo; by Jadunath Sarkar vol. III. chap. XXX. pp. 265-279 for firmans to demolish temples such as those of Somanātha, Mathurā, Viśvanātha in Benares, Ujjain and Appendix V. It is not necessary to go into great details about the terrible persecution of the Jews in Europe and the horrible deeds of the Inquisition in Europe and particularly in Spain and Portugal. For the persecution and expulsion of the Jews in Europe one may read &lsquo;A short History of the Jewish people&rsquo; by Cecil Roth (MacMillan and Co. 1936 ) chapters XX-XXI. References to Beveral works have been given above on p. 933 note 1494 about the Inquisition. A few instances of the intolerance and barbarities of that body may be cited. The Inquisition staged what are called acts of faith or &lsquo;autos-da-fé&rsquo;. In the presence of thousands of people severe punishment would be inflicted on harmless individuals whose adherence to the Holy Catholio faith was suspected. Those that professed penitence were stripped of their property and condemned to imprisonment, deportation or the galley. The minority who refused to confess to their crime of herosy or gloried in their views would be burnt at once. Kings and nobles graced such spectacles by their presence and such spectacles were arranged at the marriagos of high persons or on the birth of a son to the reigning monarch. During the three centuries when the Inquisition was active, it is found that the it condemned about 375000 people, of whom at least one-tonth were burnt; vide Ceoil Roth&rsquo;s A short History of the Jewish people' (1936) p. 312.

<p>History of Dharmaśāstra (Seo. V, Ch. XXV</p>
<p>force&rsquo; (1878) pp. 426-427 remarks The whole system of the Inquisition was such as to render resort to torture inevitable. Its proocedings were secret; the prisoner was carefully kept in ignorance of the exact charges against him and of the evidence on which they were based. He was presumed to be guilty and his judges bont all their energies to force him to confess. To accomplish this no meads were too base or too cruel'.</p>
<p>It would be instructive to read what the state of Hindus was under Portuguese rule in Goa, where the infamous Inquisi tion was established in 1560 A. D. and continued its intolerant and inhuman work for about 250 years more. Those interested may consult &lsquo;A India Portuguesa&rsquo;, vol. II. published by the Portuguese Government in 1923, particularly the paper by Antonio de Noronha, a former judge of the High Court of Goa, on &lsquo;Os Indus de Goa&rsquo; pp. 211–355. A brief passage from a paper on Historical essay on the Konkani Language' by J. H. de Cunha Ripara, who was General Secretary to the Portuguese Governor General in India from 1855 to 1870 A. D., is very illuminating. It runs (original in Portuguese) we shall now endeavour to investigate the causes, which under the Portuguese regime, were either favourable or contrary to the culture of the Konkani language. In the first ardour of conquest temples were demolished, all the emblems of the Hindu cult were destroyed and books written in the vernacular tongue, containing or suspected of containing idolatrous precepts and doctrines, were burnt. There was even the desire to exterminate all that part of the population which could not be quickly converted; this was the desire not only during that period, but there was also at least one person who, after a lapse of two centuries, advised the Government, with magisterial gravity, to make use of such a policy.' The writer further notes that the long distance of Goa from Portugal, the invincible resistance offered by &amp; numerous population amongst whom the principal castes had reached a very high degree of civilization, obliged the conquerors to abstain from opon violence and to prefer indirect, though not gentle, means to achieve the same end. 16500,</p>

<p>Noble grandeur of Buddha&rsquo;s life</p>
<p>1021</p>
<p>suffering, his subsequent mortification of the body for years, his retirement into solitude for meditation, his struggle with Māra and final victory, his confidence that he had discovered the path of deliverance, his constant travels from city to city and village to village for about forty-five years for proaching the great truths he had discovered, his crusade against the slaughter of innocent and dumb animals in sacri fices, his passing away full of years and in peace and content ment- this panorama of Buddha&rsquo;s life had a noble grandeur and irresistible human appeal Edwin Arnold in his preface (p. XIII) to his poem &ldquo;Light of Asia' (1884) pays &amp; very eloquent tribute to Buddha&rsquo;s teaching in the following words this vener able religion which has in it the eternity of an universal hope, the immortality of a boundless love, an indestructible element of faith in the final good and the proudest assertion ever made of buman freedom'. The torch lighted by Buddha was kept burning brightly by a succession of able and worthy disciples till Buddhism reached its peak about the 6th century A. D. A reaction had already begun by that time. Substantial changes in the old Buddhist faith had been made, the ideals had changed (as noted above). From being a faith without a clear accep tance of God, many sects arose that had become thoroughly theistic and Buddha himself came to be worshipped as if he were God and the sects were gripped by the strange doctrines and evil practices of Vajrayāna Tantrik sects; and Buddhism became a medley of conflicting dogmas and was riven with dis sensions and internecine rupture. Discussions as to doctrines arose immediately on the passing away of Buddha, when the first council was held at Rājagļha, a second one being held about one hundred years later at Vesāli and a third one at Pataliputra under Asoka. In all four councils appear to bave been held to secure &lsquo;sangiti&rsquo; (standardized scriptural recital) according to traditions, but no Pali book can be traced back to a time before the council held in the time of Asoka (about 250 B. C.). These discussions and subsequent schisms very much undermined Buddhism. This is mentioned as the first of the four main causes of the decline and disappearance of Buddhism from India by N. J. O&rsquo;Connor.</p>
<p>III. From about the end of the 7th century A. D. India was divided into several independent but small and warring States. Buddhism could not secure the favour and patronage of powerful and zealous monarchs and emperors like Asoka, Kaniṣka and</p>
<p>1022</p>
<p>History of Dharma sāstra 18eo. V, Ch. XXV</p>
<p>Harsa. Royal patronage on a large scale having ceased from the end of the 7th century A. D., except under the Pala kings of Bengal, Buddhism began to wane.</p>
<p>IV. Many of the ablest and most vigorous exponents of Buddhist thought and faith left India for propagating their faith in other landa. Dr. Radhakrishnan in India and China' names 24 eminent Indian scholars who went to China for propagating Buddha&rsquo;s teachings from the 3rd Century A. D. to 973 A. D. (p. 27 ) and also mentions a fou Chinese scholars who came to India for visiting the sacred places of Buddhism and for making a study of Buddhism on the spot ( ibid. pp. 27-28 ).</p>
<p>V. The observance of the high moral ideals inculcated by Gotama Buddha must have been found irksome by at least a great many of his followers, and particularly after his personal example ceased to exist. In the Mabāparinibbānasutta (S. B. E. vol. XI. p. 127 ) we are told that Subhadda, a barber who had been received in the Order in his old age, addressed the brethren, that deeply mourned and lamented on Buddha&rsquo;s nirvana, am follows: &ldquo;Weep not, neither lament. We are well rid of the Great Samana. We used to be annoyed by being told this becomes you, this beseems you not!. But now we shall be able to do whatever we like; and what we do not like that we shall not have to do.&rdquo; Ordinary people could not be fed for long on mere repetition of the sermon on suffering being the lot of man, on monasticism, aversion to speculation and on promises of nirvāṇa which was hardly ever well defined. By nirvana Buddha probably meant extinction of egoism and desires, a state of bliss beyond understanding and not a complete annihilation or extinction. But this last was the sense in which many under stood it. Buddha had an aversion to speculation and parti cularly to issues that were irrelevant to his purely moral approach and purpose. Several questions of a metaphysical or speculative character such as whether the world is permanent or not, whether it is finite or not, whether the soul ia the same as the body or other than the body, wbether the Tathāgata continues after death or not were left unanswered by Buddha (vide Majjhima Nikāya diecourse 63, Trenckner&rsquo;s ed. vol. I.), Mons staries of Buddhist monks and puns became in course of time centres of idleness, pleasures and immorality, and of debesed practices like those of Vajrayāna Tantricism. A well-known scholar like Rahula Saṅkstyāyada, bimself a Buddhist bhikṣu, in a paper on &lsquo;Vajrayāna and the 84 Siddhas&rsquo; contributed to the</p>
<p>Debased state of Buddhist monasteries</p>
<p>1023</p>
<p>Journal Asiatique vol. 225 ( 1934 ) pp. 209–230 was constrained to say &ldquo;The monasteries and templos were gorged with riches due to the pious offerings made by the multitudes. The life of the monk became more comfortable than that of the layman. The discipline weakened and many unfit persons entered the community. 1651 The easy life associated with the culture of a sensual art under the cover of cultured paintings, meditation, gods and goddesses must have inclined the minds towards sensuality. Already from the Kathāvatthu 165la (XXIII, 1) we know that the Andhaka School was disposed to permit Maithuna (copulation) for a special object; it was introduced in the mystic cult. Coming to the south, the practice of mantras, psychical practices, and a certain indulgence in the pleasures of sense were united; the Vajrayāna was complete &ldquo;.</p>

<p>restraint, sexual purity and other virtues for persons of all the four varnas, just as Buddha and early Buddhist works did for his followers.

Even the Rgveda solemnly says ( X, 85.1) &lsquo;the earth is supported by Truth, the sky is supported by the Sun&rsquo;. The Mundaka Up. exhorts Truth alons is victorious, not falsehood &lsquo;(III. 1.6).</p>
<p>VII. The strong faith and the alertness of brāhmanas wlo welded into a coherent whole the Veda, the philosophy of the Upaniṣads, Yogic practices of a middle path as in Gita VI. 15-17, the doctrine of salvation by faith and bbakti for all preached in the Gitā gradually held an irresistible appeal.</p>
<p>VILI. In re-orienting their religious outlook and practices to stem the tide of Buddhism and make Hinduism popular, the brāhmaṇas and other leaders of Hindu society of the centuries before and after the Christian era had to make compromises of a far-reaching character; the old Vedic gods (like Indra and Varuṇa) recoded into the background though not totally forgotten, most of the Vedic sacrifices had to be given up, deities like Dovi, Ganosa and the Mātrs had to be brought to the front, Paurāpika mantras came to be used along with Vedic ones as the mantras even in sraddha (e. g.&rsquo; dātāro nobbivardhaptām' &amp;c, wbich occurs in Manu III, 259, Yaj, I. 246, Matsya 16. 49-50, Padma, Srstikhanda 9. 117, Kūrma II, 22. 60 and other works ). Even an early writer like Varāhamibira (first half of 6th century A.D.) in describing the Pusya-snāna for the king provides ordinary mantras (Bṭ. S. 47.55-70 ) to be recited by the purohita along with mantras in the Atharvaveda, Rudra (Tai. S. IV. 5. 1-11), the Kūṣmāṇda mantras (Vaj. S. XX. 14-16 and others, Br. S. 47.71 ) and winds up the whole procedure with a well-known Paurāṇika verse. 1653 Even Aparārka (pp. 14-15 ) had to say that in Devapūjā the procedure to be followed is that in the Narasimhapurana (probably something like the one in chap. 2. of the Narasimha Purāpa ) and in the matter of &lsquo;pratistha&rsquo; ( establishment of images) also Paurāṇika procedure was to be adopted Besides, emphasis was laid on abimsā, charity (dāna),</p>

<p>Changes introduced by Purānas</p>
<p>1025</p>
<p>pilgrimages and vrata, and it was said that the latter two were inore efficacious than even Vedic sacrifices. These changes seriously reduced the appeal of Buddhism. The purāṇas con tained stories of goda and avatāras that viedlin their appeal to the common man with the Buddhist Jataka tales. The Kādambari of Bāṇa ( first half of 7th century A. D.) states that the people of Ujjayini were fond of the Mahābhārata, Purāṇas and Rāmāyaṇa (Mahābhārata-Purāṇa-Rāmāyaṇā-nurāgiṇā &amp;c). This is put down as the last of the four causes of the decline of Buddhism by O&rsquo;Connor.</p>
<p>IX. From about the 7th century A. D. Buddha began to be recognised by Hindus as an avatāra of Viṣnu and by the 10th century Buddha came to be so recognised throughout India by almost all Hindus.</p>
<p>X. Moslem fanaticism and invasions of India delivered the coup de grace (final blow) to Buddhism about and after 1200 A. D. by ruining famous universities like those of Nalanda and Vikramasila and the monks were mercilessly killed in large numbers. Those who escaped the carnage fled to Tibet and Nepal. H. M. Elliott&rsquo;s History of India (as told by its own. historians) vol. II p. 306 contains a passage from Tabakat-i Nasiri about Bakhtiyar Khilji that states that Bakhtiyar led his army to Behar and ravaged it, that great plunder fell in his hands, that most of the inhabitants of the place were brāhmaṇas with shaven heads, that they were put to death, that large numbers of books were found and it was discovered that the whole fort and city was a place of study (madrasa). The des cription indioates that brāhmana with shaven heads were Buddhist monks.</p>
<p>It should not be supposed that Buddhist bhikkhus renounc ed wealth altogether: Vide I. A. vol. VII pp. 254–256 (Insorip tions 2 and 9 at Kuda) where bhikṣus and bhikṣuṇis are donors and Cunningam&rsquo;s * Bhilsa Topos' p. 235–236 where there are many bhikṣus and some bhikṣunis among donors. The great appeal of the original Buddhism to common men lay in its spirit of self-abnegation, discipline, service and sacrifice.</p>
<p>When Moslem invaders exterminated the monks the laity became bewildered and were either converted to Islam or became slowly absorbed among Hindus. It has been already stated that Buddha himself was against the admission of women into the Sangha but at the persistent requests of his favourite pupil</p>

<p>The Pātimokkha for monks contains 217 articles which were to be recited twice a month in an assembly of at least four monks and confessions of breaches of the rules had to be made. If one reads the Cullavagga (SBE. XX. pp 330-340), one may understand how the gatherings of legions of monks and nung in immense monasteries led in some cases to sapping the ordinary observances of decency and morality. At first the Pātimokkha could be recited to nuns by monks and the nuns could confess their lapses to monks but this had to be changed later and it was laid down that only bhikkhuṇis could do these things for them. P. 333 of the same shows how nuns quarrelled among themselves and came to blows and p. 335 narrates how some monks throw dirty water on nuns and how they uncovered their bodies and thighs before nuns.</p>
<p>The author has cited the above as the main causes of the disappearance of Buddhism following what most have written. Different writers attach importance to a few of them according to their individual leanings. While prepared to concede that the causes noted above went a long way in bringing about the downfall of Buddhism in India, he feels that the principal cause was that large sections of the Indian population came to realize that the persistent teaching of the world being a place of suffer. ing, of giving up all desires and of monasticism, which were preached by the writers on Buddhism to all and sundry, was too much for ordinary men to attempt and that the Hindu ideal of an ordered scheme of life into four āśramas,1654 with peculiar duties and rights, particularly the importance attached to the gshasthāśrama showed to vast populations that family life properly regulated and disciplined was capable of realizing the highest that man was capable of and that too much insistence on the giving up of all desires (including desire for life ) sapped the very stability and continuance of human society and</p>

II, pp. 425– 426 and 540-541.</p>
<p>Not only Dharmaśāstras but also great poets like Kālidāsa emphasized the supreme importance of the householder&rsquo;s stage to society. In the Raghuvamsa 1656 (V. 10) king Raghu says to a learned brābmana student it is now time for you to pass on to the second stage of life that is capable of being useful to (mon of) other asramas'. In the Sākuntala also Kālidāga harps on the same idea.</p>
<p>When Buddha came to be worshipped by Buddhists 28 God, whon Buddhists gave up the original characteristic doctrine of the attainment of the peace and bliss of nirvana in this very life through the eradication of selfish desires by following the Noble Eightfold Path, when Buddhists adopted the doctrines of bhakti and the ideal they set up was the evolution of bodhi. sattvas through aeons by good deeds, the line of demarcation between Buddhism and popular Hinduism became very thin and was gradually obliterated. Buddhism disappeared from India because of these deviations from the original doctrine and because the brāhmaṇas made Hinduism very comprehensive by finding a place for purely monistic idealism, for the worship of several gods, for the performance of vedic or other religious rites (i. e. Karmamārga) as a preparation for higher spiritual life. The ultimate victory of Hinduism shows the strength and comprehensiveness of its religion and philosophy as against the onesidedness of Buddhism in its various pbases and its silence on matters of great moment to the inquiring human mind.&rdquo; 8,- 1655.

<p>History of Dharmatāstra (Seo. V, C. XXV</p>
<p>The Puranas and Dharmaśāstras put so muoh emphasis on ahimsa that millions of people in India became and are even now strict vegetarians not only among brāhmaṇas, but also among vaiśyas and sūdras, while it appears that Buddhists all over the world are not strict vegetarians at all. To-day very few of the ideal virtues that Buddhism set before even laymen are a matter of endeavour for most Buddhists in all lands. In spite of Buddha&rsquo;s crusade against animal sacrifices and Asoka&rsquo;s drastic measures to eliminate the killing and cruelty to birds and beasts, it is found that some Vedic sacrifices (including animal sacrifices ) continued to be performed by Indian kings and common people during the centuries before and after the Christian ora. A few examples are cited here : (1) Sepāpati Puṣyamitra (about 150 B. C.) performed two Aśramedhas (E. I. vol XX pp 54-58, Harivamsa III. 2. 35 ff 1657 ( which latter speaks of Senāni Kāśyapa-dvija as performer of Aśvamedha in Kali age ) and Kālidāsa&rsquo;s Malavikāgnimitra ( Act V) where he is spoken of as engaged in Rajasūya sacrifice; (2) Khāravela, king of Kalinga and a Jain, performed in the 6th year of his roign a Rājasūya (E. I. XX. p. 79); (3) Bhavanāga of the Bhāraśiva lineage (about 200 A. D.) glorified as the performer of ten Aśvamedhas in Vākātaka plates (Chammak plate of Vākāṭaka Pravarasena II. in Gupta Inscriptions No. 55 pp. 236 237, 1658 and in Poona plates of Prabhāvatigupta, the chief queen of Vākāṭaka Rudrasena II in E.

XV. p. 39 ); (5) The great Gupta emperor Samudragupta (about 325–370 A.

<p>It may be noted that even learned brāhmaṇas sometimes performed eleborate Vedic sacrifices. For example, the fifth in ascent from Bhavabhūti performed a Vājapeya at Padmapura in Dakṣiṇāpatha. In the Vājapeya, seventeen was a chara cteristio number and seventeen animals were to be sacrificed therein. Vide for description of Vājapoya, H. of Dh. vol II. pp. 1206-1212. As Bhavabhūti flourished in the first half of the 8th century A. D., the fifth in ascent from him who performed Vajapeya must have flourished about a hundred years before him i. e. in the first half of the 7th century A. D.</p>
<p>In these days it has become a fashion to praise Buddha and his doctrines to the skies and to disparage Hinduism by making unfair comparisons between the original doctrines of Buddha with the present practices and shortcomings of Hindu society. The present author has to enter a strong protest against this tendonoy. If a fair comparison is to be made it should be made between the later phases of Buddhism and the present practices of professed Buddhists on the one hand and modern phases and practices of Hinduism on the other. The Upaniṣads had a nobler philosophy than that of Gautama the Buddha, the latter merely based his doctrines on the philosophy of the Upaniṣads. If Hinduism decayed in course of time and exhi</p>

<p>bited bad tendencies, the same or worse was the oase with later Buddhism which gave up the noble but human Buddha, made him a god, worshipped his images and ran wild with such hideous practices as those of Vajrayāna. As a counterblast to what modern oncomiasts often say about Buddhism the present author will quote a strongly-worded (but not unjust ) passage from Swami Vivekananda&rsquo;s lecture on &ldquo;The sages of India&rdquo; (Complete Works, volume III. p. 248-268, 7th ed. of 1953 publi shed at Māyāvati, Almora) &ldquo;The earlier Buddhists in their rage against the killing of animals had denounced the sacrifices of the Vedas; and these sacrifices used to be held in every house &hellip; &hellip; These sacrifices were obliterated and in their place came gorgeous temples, gorgeous ceremonies and gorgeous priests and all that you see in India in modern times. I smile when I read books written by some modern people who ought to know better that the Buddha was the destroyer of Brahmanical idolatry. Little do they know that Buddhisin created brahmanism and idolatry in India. &hellip; Thus in spite of the proaching of mercy to animals, in spite of the sublime ethical religion, in spite of the hair-splitting discussions about the existence or non-existence of a permanent soul, the whole building of Buddhism tumbled down piecemeal; and the ruin was simply hideous. I have neither the time nor the inclination to describe to you the hideousness that came in the wake of Buddhism. The most hideous ceremonies, the most horrible, the most obscene books that human hands ever wrote or the human brain over conceived, the most bestial forms that ever passed under the nanie of religion have all been the creation of degraded Buddhism&rdquo; (pp. 264–265 ).</p>

<p>CHAPTER XXVI Tūntrik doctrines and Dharmasastra</p>
<p>In H. of Dh. vol. II. p. 739 while dealing with the worship of Durga, who is also worshipped as Sakti (cosmic power or energy ), it was stated that the influence of Sākta worship has boon great throughout India and a promise was given that a brief treatment of Sāktiem would follow in a later volume. It is now time to deal with Śāktas and Tantras, which exercised some influence over the Purāṇas and directly and through the Purānas over Indian religious ritual and practices in the medieval ages.</p>
<p>There is a vast literature on Tantras, published and unpublished. There are Buddhist Tantras, Hindu Trantras and Jaina Tantras. There is a philosophical or spiritual side in some of the Tantras which has not been much studied except by Arthur Avalon, B. Bhattacharya and a few others. In the popular mind Tantras bave been associated with the worship of Sakti ( Goddess Kāli ), with mudrās, mantras, mandalas, the five makaras, the Dakṣiṇamārga and the Vāma-mārga, and magic practices for acquiring supernatural powers. All that can and will be attempted here is to trace briefly the origin of Sāktism and Tantra and point out some of the ways in which tantra has entered into Hindu ritual directly and indireotly through the Purānas.</p>
<p>The Amarakośa states that tantra means ' principal matter or part&rsquo;, &lsquo;siddhānta&rsquo; (i. e, doctrine or śāstra ), a loom or paren phernalia. But it does not state that tantra means a certain peculiar class of works. Therefore, the inference is not altogether unjustifiable that in its time works bearing the peculiar charaoter of what are called Tantras were either not composed or had not at least attained great vogue. In Rg. X. 71. 9 the word ' tantra&rsquo; ooours and appears to mean a loom. These ignorant 1660 men do not move about lower down ( in this world) nor in a higher</p>

<p>world, being neither (learned) brāhmaṇas nor some-extracting priests; these resort to speech (of a vile kind) and with that vile speech they engage in handling ploughs and looms! The Atharveveda (X. 7. 42) (&lsquo;tantram-eke yurati virūpe abhya krāmam vayataḥ san-mayūkham&rsquo;) employs the word tantra in the same sense and so does the Tai. Br. II. 5. 5. 3 in a closely similar passage. Pāṇini (V. 2. 70 ) derives the word &lsquo;tantraka&rsquo; (a cloth that is recently taken away from a loom) from tantra'. The Ap. Sr. employs the word 1661 tantra in the sense of &lsquo;procedure containing many parts&rsquo;. The sān. Sr. applies the word tantra to what being once done serves the purpose of many other actions. The Mahābhāsya on Pāṇini IV. 2.60 and Vārtika sarvasāder dvigośca lah&rsquo;cites &lsquo;garvatantrah&rsquo; and &lsquo;dvitantrah&rsquo; as examples meaning one who has studied all the tantras' or &lsquo;one who has studied two tantras&rsquo;, tantra probably meaning &lsquo;siddbānta&rsquo;. In Yāj. I. 228 (tantram va vaisva.devikam') the word tantra is employed in the sense in which the commentary on the Sān. Sr. takes it. The 15th adhikarapa of Kautilya&rsquo;s Arthaśāstra bears the title &ldquo;Tantrayukti' (vide J. O, R., Madras, vol. 4, 1930, p. 82 ff) meaning the main canons or propositions or principles of exposition of a śāstra. Caraka (Siddhisthāna, chap. 12. 40-45) also speaks of &lsquo;36 tantrasya yuktayah&rsquo; and Susruta ( Uttara tantra, chap. 65 ) names 32 tantrayuktis. In Bphaspati and Katyāyana and in the Bhagavata the word tantra is employed in the sense of doctrine' or &lsquo;sāstra&rsquo;. Sabara in his bhāṣya on Jaimini XI. I. 1 remarks that when and thing or act, once done, becomes useful in several 1662 matters, that is called &lsquo;tantra&rsquo;. Saṅkarācārya in several passages of his bhāṣya on the Vedanta.' sūtras speaks of the Saṅkhya system as sānkhya-tantra and of the Purvammāmgā as &lsquo;prathama-tantra &lsquo;. 1663 In the Kālikā</p>

<p>Meaning of tantra in early works</p>

<p>purina (87.130) the works of Usanas and Bphaspati on Rajaniti ( the science of statecraft) are called tantras and in 92.2 the Viṣnudharmottara-purāna is called tantra. In all these cases the peculiar meaning attached to the word tantra in medieval times does not occur.</p>
<p>It is difficult to determina the exact 1664 time when the word tantra came to bo employed in the sense in which it is used in the 80-called tantra literature nor is it possible to decide what people first introduced tantra principles and practices or where they first arose. M. M. Haraprasad Shastri was inclined to hold that the principles and practices of tantra came to India from out side and he relies mainly on a verse in the Kubjikāmatatantra 1665</p>

Arthur Avalon in Mahānirvāṇatantra (3rd ed, of 1953 p. 560) holds that tantra was brought into India from Chaldea or Sakadvipa. In &lsquo;Modern Review&rsquo; for 1934 pp. 150–156 Prof. N, N. Choudhari tries to prove that Indian tāntricism bas its origin in the Bon religion of Tibet. He relies on the Tibetan tradition of Asanga baving introduced Tantricism in India. But that tradition is mainly based on Taranath&rsquo;s History of Buddhism. Lama Taranath was born in 1573 A, D. (1575 A, D, according to some) and completed bis history in 1608 i. e. he wrote about twelve hundred years after Asanga.

Here he is wrong. The Vidyāsūkta in Nirakta (II. 4) and the passage of the Svetāśvatara Upanisad quoted in bote 1540 make the Vaidika position of the guru clear. As for the Paorānika position of guru, vide the Lingaparāṇa (quoted in note 1718 below) and Devi bhāgavata (XI. 1. 49.Gurur-brahma&rsquo; &amp;c. in the same pota) and the Vorse &lsquo;यस्य देवे पर भक्तिर्यथा देखे तथा शुरौ तस्यैते कथिता पर्याः प्रकाशन्ते महात्मन: चेताया 34.

<p>which says &lsquo;go thou to the country of Bharata for exorotsing dominance on all sides and bring about new creation in varioua ways in pithas, upapithas and kṣetras&rsquo;. With all respect to that great scholar it has to be said that the passage does not affirm that tantra principles were then unknowe in India and were first introduced in Bbārata after that verse was uttered. That passage could very well have been uttered even when tantra practices had already taken hold of people&rsquo;s minds in India and the reference to pithas aad ksetras ( in the verse ) clearly indi cates that what is meant is only a record of an existing fact, just as the Purāṇas speak in a prophetic vein about what is past. It is possible that a few mystic practices of Rulācāra or Vāmācāra owe their origin to foreign elements or sources. But the one Verse on which M. M. H. P. Shastri relied is far too inadequate for proving this. The Rudrayāmala ( ed. by Jivananda, 1892) contains a panegyric of the Atharvayeda ( 17th patala, verse 4). saying that all gods, all beings (on land, in water and air ), ali sages, Kamavidyā and Mahavidyā dwell in it; verses 10-17 dwell upon the mysterious Kundalini, verses 31 ff dilate upon Yogic practices and six cakras in the body, verses 51-53 mention Kāmarūpa, Jalandhara, Purnagiri, Uddiyāna, and a few otherg 89 Kalika pithas, Bagchi (in Studies in Tantra&rsquo; pp. 45-55 ) adduces some evidence of foreign elements in the tāntrik doctrines. The Rudrayāmala 166 (17th Patala, verges 119-125 ) states that Mabāvidyā appeared to sage Vasiṣtha and asked him to go to Cinadeśa and Buddha, who is said to have taught Vasistha the K&rsquo;aula path, Yoga practices for the attainment of siddhis ( extraordinary powers) and directed him to make use of five makāras ( madya &amp;c.) in his sūdhanā for becoming a perfect Yogin. All this shows that pithas flourished in India when the Rudrayāmāla was composed, that Tantrik practices had grown in China or Tibet and that Buddha was deemed to have taught those practices, which is a libel and a vile travesty of Buddha&rsquo;s noble teaching.</p>

<p>Mystic words and magic spelfs in Veda 1035</p>
<p>Magio spells are found in plenty in the Atharvayeda and some mystic words or syllables are used even in the Rgveda; e. g. the word &lsquo;yaṣat, ooours in Rg. VII. 99. 7, VII, 100.7 and other verses and the word svāha 1687 OCCUTS Over a dozen times in the Rgveda (e. g. in I. 13. 12, V. 5, 11, VII. 2. 11). A sleep inducing spell occurs in Rg. VII. 55. 5–8, 1668 which verses occur also in the Atharvaveda IV.5.6,5, 1, 3 and which spell waa probably employed by a purohita to put to sleep some noble man complaining of sleepless11888 at night. Some Western scholars have held that this hymn is a lover&rsquo;s charm for &amp; clandestine meeting with his lady-love. But the whole hymn ban hardly any words of love in it and the author is not able to accept that theory as proved. Rgveda X 145 is a hymn to be employed against a co-wife, the first verse of which is &lsquo;I dig up this herb, which is a most powerful crespor, by which (a woman) injures her co-wife and by which she secures her husband ( to herself alone )&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The Rgveda frequently mentions magicians who appear to have been mostly non-Aryans described as adeva (godless anstadeva ( worshipping false gods ), siśnadeva (lecherous, Rs. VIL. 21. 5, X. 99. 3). For reasons of space, it is not possible to go into great details. Tāntrik works describe the six cruel. acts which will be dealt with later on. In the Vedic times it was supposed that some wicked people could by charms and incantan tions bring about the death of men and animals or make thema ill. Two long hymns (VI. 104 and X. 87 both containing 25 Verses) are enough to show how the Rgyeda people were afraid of black magic. Both hymns are full of the words ' Yātudhāna&rdquo; (one who employs black magic) and &lsquo;rakṣas.&rsquo; (devil or evil spirit), the word yātu being the same as &ldquo;jadu&rsquo; (employed in Marathi and other regional Indian languages). There were female evil spirits also oalled &lsquo;pisaoi&rsquo; (Rg. I. 133, 5 O Indra 1 destroy the reddish very powerful pisāoi and kill all evil spirits )&rsquo;. A few verses from the Rgveda may be tradslated</p>

In the Atharvaveda there are numerous hymds styled * satrunāśana&rsquo; (destructive of enemies) e. g. II. 12–24, III, 6, IV. 3 and 40, V. 8, VI. 6, 65-67 and 134.

S. In the Ap. Sr. Sātra phat is employed in offering Soma stalks in abhi cūra ( employment of spells for a malevolent purpose ). Phat is a sound frequently employed in the worship of Devi in Tantra works. But no direct connection or line of evolution from the Atharvaveda to the Tantras can be traced, The Tattvasangraha of śāntarakṣita (705–762 A. D.) connects even Buddha with magio practices. It says &lsquo;all wise mon declare that it is dharma from which results worldly prosperity and the highest beatitude. Seen results such as intelligence, health, rulership are produced by properly observing the rules about mantras, yoga and the like declared by him (i, e. 1671 by Buddha)&rsquo;. But one cannot place implicit reliance on any writer&rsquo;s statement made more than a thousand yean after the event or person referred to in it.

Further, there is a story of miraculous powers possessed by all the members of the family of a layman called Mendaka (viz, himself, his wife, son and daughter-in-law ) in Mahāvagga VI. 34. 1 ff. (8. B. E. vol. XVI. pp. 121 ff). Honey again we have to remember that there is nothing in the Tipitaka or any early Buddhist document to prove that Buddha or his first disciples had anything to do with mudrūs, mantras and mandalas and that neither Yuan Chwang nor I-tsing refers to any Tantras, though both of them refer to the Buddhist mona stories as centres of Buddhist culture (vide Dr. De in N. I. a. vol. I. pp. 1 ff). In the introduction to Sadhanamālā (vol. II, LXVIII.) Dr. Bhattacharya relies upon the words Sugatom padistam&rsquo; and &lsquo;Sugataiḥ&rsquo; occurring on pp. 334-335 of &lsquo;the Sadhanamālā for holding that Buddha himself must have pro mulgated some mantras. There are two weighty objections this *Sugataiḥ&rsquo; does not always mean Buddha, but means also &lsquo;followers of Buddha&rsquo; and secondly, just as most Hindu Tantras are dialogues between Siva and Parvati, 80 later Buddhist writers might have easily said that they aro quoting the Buddha; the same objection applies to Kamalaśila&rsquo;s romarks quoted by Dr. Bhattacharya, 43 Kamalasila and his teacher tourisbed about 1200 years after Buddha.</p>
<p>The question whether Buddhist Tantras were prior to Hindu Tantras or vice versa is difficult to decide. It appears probable that both arose nearly about the same time. Vide The Sāktas&rsquo; by E. A. Payne pp. 72–74 for discussion of views. In the Sādbanamālā (a Vajrayana work consisting of 312 small works composed according to Dr. Bhattacharya from the 3rd century A, D. to 12th century A. D.) four pithas (chief centres) of Vajrayāna 1673 are mentioned viz. Kāmākhyā, Sirihatta (or Srthatta ), Pūrnagiri and Uddiyana. The first two are reaper</p>

<p>tively identified with Kamakhya or Kamarūpa ( three miles from Gauhati) and modern Sylhet. The exact situation of the other two is a controversial matter. M. M. E. P. Shastri identified Uddiyāna (which is most frequently mentioned as a pitha ) with Orissa. His son Dr. B. Bhattacharya thinks it most probable that Vajrayāna Tāntrioism arose in Uddiyāna (p. 46 of Intro. to B. E.). Dr. Bagchi in Studies in the Tantras&rsquo; pp. 37-40 furnishes good grounds for holding that Uddiyāna was near Swat valloy in N. W. India and Grousset &lsquo;In the footsteps of Buddha&rsquo; pp. 109-110 holds the same view. The Bārbaspatya Sūtra (ed. by F. W. Thomas) names eight sāktaksetras (III. 123–124). In his Intro. to Bādhanamala (vol. II. p. LXXVIII) Dr. Bhattacharya holds that the Hindu tantras were introduced on the model of the Buddhist tantrag. But Winternitz (in</p>
<p>History of Indian Literature&rsquo;, Eng. tr., vol. II. p. 401) states that this view of Dr. Bhattacharya is contrary to the facts and the present writer agrees with this view.</p>
<p>Though Dr. Bhattacharya admits that Buddhism and Jainism exploited Hindu gods in the earlier period, he asserts (on p. 147 of his Intro. to B. E.) that it is possible to declare without fear of contradiction that the Buddhists were the first to introduce the Tantras in their religion and that the Hindus borrowed them from the Buddhists in later times&rsquo;. It is no honour to ancient Hindus to be called the pioneers in the practice of black magio. But scholars have to seek truth irrespective of the question of honour or dishonour. Very weighty arguments are advanced by Valleé Poussin (in E. R. E. vol. XII, p. 193), Winternitz and Payne (on sāktas p. 73 ) for the opposite view and the present author agroos with them. Hundreds of works were translated from Sanskrit into Tibetan and Chinese. The traffio of borrowing has been all one way from India to Tibet and China. Vide a paper on &lsquo;China&rsquo;s debt to India&rsquo; by Prof. Liang Chi Chao in Viśvabhārati Quarterly, vol. II, for 1924-25 pp. 251–261, where it is stated that 24 Hindu scholars from A. D. 67 to 789 came to China, besides 13 from Kashmir and that the Chinese scholars that went to India for study from 265-790 A. D, numbered 187 of which the names of 105 can be ascertained.</p>

<p>History of Dharmalāstra (Soc. VI, 06. XXVI</p>
<p>There is hardly any evidence of the translations of Chinese or Tibetan works into Sanskrit. Besides, the three great Chinese travellers never refer to the study of Buddhist Tantras in India. Watters On Yuan Chwang&rsquo;s Travels in India ' vol. I. p. 360 narratos a story from the pilgrim&rsquo;s life that when he left Ayodhyā in a boat and proceeded east down the Ganges, thugs that looted the boat decided to sacrifice him to Durgā but that the Chinese pilgrim was saved by a hurricane which put the thugs in terror, who released him and treated him with Teveronce. Vide also &lsquo;In the Footsteps of Buddha&rsquo; by René Grousset pp. 133-135 for this incident. We see that there is evidence of the prevalence of Tantrik and Sākta worship in India long before the 7th century A. D. There is hardly any evidence of any Buddhist Tantrik work before 650 A, D. except perbaps the Guhyasamajatantra and Manjusrimūlakalpa, both of which contain late elements. In this way, presumption and chronology are both against borrowing by Hinduism from Buddhist Tibetan or Chinese Tantrik works. Vide Tibet past and present' by Sir Charles Bell (1924) pp. 23, 25, 29, Sardar K. M. Panikkar&rsquo;s work &lsquo;India and China&rsquo; (1957) p. 70, &lsquo;Intro duction of the alphabet in Tibet&rsquo; by M.M. Dr. Satischandra who holds that it was borrowed from Magadha in 7th Century A. D., that show that a written script based on an Indian alphabet as prevalent in Kashmir was first introduced about 640 A. D., that the Tantrik Buddhist Padmasambhava was summoned from Uddiyāna by a Tibetan king Ti-son Do-tson (749-786 A. D.) on the recommendation of Santarakṣita Bodhisattva and was induced to settle in Tibet. Bunjiu Nanjio&rsquo;s Catalogue of Tripitaka' (Oxford, 1883), appendix II. p. 445 No. 155 shows that Amoghavajra translated many works between 746 and 771 A. D., died in 774 A. D. and that it was under his influence that Tantra doctrines gained currency in China. It is clear from the works of Bāṇa as detailed later on that worship of Candikā with wide and flesh was prevalent in India long before 600 A. D., that Śriparvata was famed for its tāntrik siddhis, that sivasamhitas existed, that japa of mantras a crore of times in a cemetery was gupposed to confer siddhis, that he 14th of the dark half of a month was deemed the proper tithi for japa and black magic. Therefore, it is most likely that Sākta or Tāntrik dootrines were taken to China and Tibet from India and not vice versa. Prof. P. V. Bapat in &lsquo;2500 years of Buddhism&rsquo; (pp. 360-376) follows (at p. 363) Dr. B. Bhattacharya and tries to prove that Tibetan Tāntrism is earlier than Hindu Tantrism, but his argumento</p>
<p>Time of entry of Buddhism in Tibet</p>
<p>1041</p>
<p>like those of Dr. Bhattacharya do not oarry conviction at all, Dr. A. S. Altekar in his paper on Sanskrit Literature in Tibet ( ABORI, Vol. 35 pp. 54-66) shows how Buddhism entered into Tibet in the reign of Strong-Tsan-Gampo (637-693 A, D.), that about 750 A. D. :Padmasambhava from Orissa and Vairocana from Kashmir were pioneers and how about 4500 works were translated into Tibetan.</p>
<p>Even Dr. Bhattacharya admits that Buddhist Tantras in outward appearance resemble in a marked degree Hindu Tantras (p. 47 of Intro. to B. E.), but he contends that in the subject inatter, the philosophical doctrines and religious principles there is little similarity. As Buddhism did not believe in Hindu gods they do not speak about Sakti or Sāktism. But just as in Hindu Tantras there is the male principle Siva and the female principle of Devi, the Buddhists postulate Prajñā (which is feminine) and Upāya (masculine) as two principles and invest them with the same roles as those of Siya and Davi but reyorsed in character. They had to graft on the idea of Sunyata the ideas underlying the concepts of Siya and Devi or Sakti. The subject matter is very similar as regards the goal and means (Yoga &amp;o) and the procedure of mantra, guru, mandala &amp;c. is the same. The most important and early works of Buddhist Tāntric cult, the Prajñopāya-viniscayasiddhi and Jõānasiddhi are not earlier than the 8th century A. D., when Sāktism and Tantrismo had both boon long established in India.</p>
<p>The word &lsquo;Sākta ' means one who is a worshipper or devotee of Sakti&rsquo; (cosmic power or energy). It appears that long before the 8th century A. D. this cult had spread in almost all parts of India, particularly in Bengal and Assam. Sakti under different names (such as Tripurā, Lohita, Sdaśikā, Kāmeśvari) was conceived to be the primordial principle of all activity in the universe and is generally worshipped under the name of Devi. The Devīmābātmya is one of the chief works of the Saktas and has been described above on pp. 155-156. The chief characteristics of the sākta cult are the doctrinc that God or Deity is one and is to be conceived as the mother and also the destroyor 1674 and that there is a special form of ceremonial</p>

<p>worship which sometimes assumed debased and revolting forms. Dari has been eulogised in other Purāṇas also as in Vamana (18-19), Doyl-bhagavata (III. 27), Brahmānda (that oontains the Lalitāmāhātmaya in 44 chapters), Matsya (13. 24-54, where 108 names of Devi and 108 places of her worship are set out), Kūrma (I. 12). In the last Purāṇa (Kūrma I. 12 ) Devi is called Mahamahiṣamardini (98), Anahata, Kundalini (128), Durgā, Katyayani, Candi, Bhadrakali (143 and 148 ) and it is stated that the śāstras opposed t675 to the Veda and Smrti that are popular among people such as Kāpāla, Bhairava, Yamala, Vāma, Arbata were propagated by Devi for deluding the world and were based on ignorance. Vide also Brahmapurāṇa (181.48-52) for names of Devi and for the proposition that Devi when worshipped with offerings of wine, flesh and other edibles becomes pleased and grants men&rsquo;s desires. Bhadrakāli is com. paratively an ancient name. In the Sāó. Gr.(SBE vol. XXIX p. 86 ) it is provided that an offering is to be made to Sri at the head of the bed on which the householder sleeps and at the foot of the bed to Bhadra-kāli, while Manu provides that, in the daily baliharana, bali (offering ) is to be offered to Bhadrakali in the south-west.</p>
<p>The Tantras and Sākta works have much in common, the main point of difference being that in the Sākta cult Devi (or Śakti) is worshipped as the highest, while Tantras (which include also Buddhist and Jaina works) are not restricted to the worship of Devi or Sakti, but may be agnostic, Vedāntic or</p>
<p>Sāṅkhya in their philosophical outlook. Dr. B. Bhattacharya</p>
<p>• (in Intro. to Gubyasamājatantra p. XXXIV and in Intro, to</p>
<p>Sadhananālā vol. II, p. XIX) states that, for a work to be called a real Tantra, there must be the element of Sakti in it. But this is plainly rather an over-statement. The Vāyupurāṇa enumo. rates the Sākta among six darśanas ( philosophio points of view) as in note 16750</p>
<p>Even the Rgveda speaks of the Saktis of the great gods of the Vedic pantheon. But the Sakti or Saktis are of the God</p>

The word Śakti' occurs in the Rgveda about a dozen times in the singular as well as in the plural, five times with Indra, 1676 once with Aśvins (Rg. II. 39.7), twice with pitps (I 109.3, VI. 75.9) and once with gods in general (X. 88. 10, who are said to have created Agni with their powers). Sometimes, the word ' Māyā' is used with regard to Indra instead of the word Śakti. ' Indra! I long for your great friendship and powers (saktih )&hellip;understand that you are our great protector; I proclaim your ancient and recent deeds, O Indra endowed with powers (Saktivah)!&hellip;&hellip;; ' Indra assuming 1677 many forms by his powers (māyābhiḥ) repairs (to many saorifices), ton hundred horses are yoked to his chariot'. In these passages there is no question of worship ping sakti or faktis of the god praised. The more frequent word, however, is &lsquo;Saci&rsquo; (&lsquo;sacibhiḥ&rsquo; occurring 36 times and &lsquo;sacyā&rsquo; 12 times). The word &lsquo;Sacipati&rsquo; (lord of Saci or power) occurs sixteen times in the Rgveda and has been applied in all places to Indra, except once in Rg. VII, 67.5 (where it is applied to Asvins). It cannot be said that in the Rgveda Saci' is the wife of Indra (as it is said in later mythology). since the plural is more frequent than Saoi in the singular and since Aśving also are called &lsquo;sacipati&rsquo;. once. Similarly, the word &lsquo;Sacīvaḥ occurs eleven times, in nine of which it is addressed to Indra but it is once applied to Agni (Rg. III. 21. 4) and once to Soma (Rg. IX. 87.9). The ideas associated with the words. Sakti&rsquo; and Saci' are those of creation, protection, valour, and bounty. In Rg. I 56. 4 Indra&rsquo;s power is called &lsquo;Devi tayiṣi&rsquo; but the word Saci does not occur in that verse. There is a sublime hymn (Rg. X. 125 ) of the power of Vāk ( speech), wherein Vak is said to associate with Rudras, Adityas, Vasus, all gods and is</p>

Vak is said to stretch the bow for Rudra in order that the destructive enerny of brahma (prayer or God Brahmā) may be killed, that Vāk stands occupy. ing all worlds and that her body touches leavon, that it is beyond heaven and the earth, that Vāk stands so vast by its greatness'. Vāk becomes the principle of all energy. Acoording to the Nighanṭu (I. 11), menā, gnāḥ and saci are three of the 57 words meaning Vāk. In Tai. S. V. 1.7.2 the metres are called .gnās'. Rg. I. 164, 41 is an enigmatio description of Vak explained in Nirukta XI. 40. It should be noticed that, just as Dovi or Sakti is associated with Siva in later literature, so are Indrāni, Varuṇānī, Agnāyi, Rodasi associated with Indra, Varupa, Agai and Maruts respectively as wives. &lsquo;I invoke Indrāṇi, 1673 Varupāni and Agnāyi for my welfare and for drink iog Soma&rsquo;; &lsquo;May the women, the wives of gods, partake of the offering, viz, Indrāṇi, Agnayi, the brilliant ( wife) of the Asyins, Rodasi; may Varuṇāṇi listen (to our laud); may the goddesses partake (of offerings) at the time (appropriate) for women&rsquo;. It must be said, however, that these goddesses ( deviḥ ) play a very subordinate part in the Rgveda. No direct connection can be traced between these Vedic goddesses and the later concep tion of Devi or Sakti. Indrāni is invoked for protection in Rg. I 22. 12, II. 32. 8, V. 46. 8, X. 86. 11-12. In Rg. V. 46. 8 Indrāni and three others are called Devapatnīs and &lsquo;gnās&rsquo;. In Rg. I. 61. 8 it is said that the gnās, the wives of gods, wovo, when Indra struck the demon Abi, a song of worship. The word &lsquo;gnā&rsquo; occurs 20 times in the Rg. in the nominative, objective, instru mental and locative and is an Indo-European word for wife (Greek has it). Vide Nir III, 21 whera &lsquo;menā&rsquo; and &lsquo;gna&rsquo; occur. In the Kenopaniṣad Umā Haimavati ( daughter of Himavat) tells of Brahma to the gods Agni, Vayu and Indra (III. 12).

In the bhāsya on Vedāntasūtra II. 1. 30 and in the sūtra itself Brahma is said to be endowed with all powers. Vide also Svetasva. IV. 1.

Raghavabhatta 1681 avera that Tantra cult is based on Sruti as can be seen from the Upaniṣads called Rāmapūrvottara- tāpaniya and Nṭsimbapūr vottara-tāpaniya. Similarly, Bhāskararāya in his commentary Setubandha on Vāmakeśvaratantra mentions several Upa niṣads as treating in detail of the bhakti of Mahātripura-sundari and interprets Rg. V. 47.4&rsquo;catvari im' as referring to Kadividya, But all these Upaniṣads seem to be purposely composed to bolster up the tantras that had come to be looked down upon and they ____1679. ते ध्यानयोगानुगता अपश्यन्देवारमशक्ति स्वगुणैनिंगदाम् । श्वेताच. 1. 33; परास्य शक्तिविविधैव श्रूयते स्वाभाविकी ज्ञानवलक्रिया च॥ श्वेताश्व.

But he forgets that apart from other sources Kalidasa (not later than about 400 A, D.) speaks of Parvati as Umā, Aparnā, Dargā, Gauri, Bbavāni and Candi in his several works and also that Kālidāsa refers to the Ardbanārīśvara form of Siva. In the last verse of the Sakuntala Kalidāsa speaks of Siva as &lsquo;parigata-faktih&rsquo; and thereby suggests that at least tbe germs of the later Sakti worsbip were not unknown in his times. Therefore, the worsbip of Durgā in her several aspects is older than 300 A. D. by at least a century or more; vide pp. 185-186 above.</li>

<p>Sakti, enumerates some of the names of Durgā as Ārya, Vedagarbhā, Ambikā, Bhadrā, Bhadra-kāli, Ksomadā, Bhāgyadā and winds up by stating that when Durgā is worshipped with offerings of wine, flesh, various kinds of foods, she, being pleased, would fulfil all desires of men. In the Kādambari of Bāṇabhatta there is a long description of the temple of Candikā at a few days' journey from Ujjayini, where there was an old Dravida devotee, in which the following points deserve to be noted, viz. offerings of the heads of animals, lion as vāhana, the slaughter of Mahiṣāsura, the doctrines of Pāśupatas written down on small books of palm leaves containing jugglery, tantra and mantras, Durgā-stotra written on a piece of cloth, ruined temples of the Mātrs and description of the Dravida devotee as knowing thousands of wonderful stories about Sriparvata. Bāpa describes at length what queen Vilāsavati, pining for a son, began doing to placate all Gods viz. sleeping in the shrines of Candikā where guggulu was being incessantly burnt, taking auspicious baths on nights of dark 14th in public squares where magic circles had been drawn by great magicians, visiting temples of Mātra, wearing amulets inside which were pieces of birch leaves on which mantras had been written with yellow pigment, and, when delivery was dear, her bed was rendered holy with various herbs, roots and yantrag (figures or diagrams). In the Harsacarita (III) there is a reference to magic circles and to human sacrifices in the description of the Saiya ascetic Bhairavā cārya who had all the Saiva-samhitas by heart, who performed the japa of a mahāmantra called Mahākālahṭdaya &amp; crore of times in a cemetery and wanted the help of Puṣpabhāti (an ancostor of Emperor Harsa ) for perfection in that mantra to be achieved by subduing a vetala and who ultimately attained to the position of Vidyadhara and rose into the starry firmament. In the last Introductory verge of the Harṣacarita the Emperor Harga is, by means of puns, called the Sriparvata in yielding all Siddhis ( supernatural powers, or fulfilment) according to the wishes of all supplianta. 1686 Those descriptions from the works of Bāṇa (first half of 7th century) show bow even long before the 7th century A. D. the worship of Candi, with flesh and the Sakta or Tantrik paraphernalia of mantras, siddhis, mandalas and yantras had gripped the minds of all Indian people, great</p>

In the same drama Saudamini is described as observing the vows of a Kāpālika on Śriparvata and as having secured supernatural powers by means of mantras. Sriparvata is mentioned as a holy place of Siva and Dovi in Vanaparva 85. 19.-20. The Vāsavam datta of Subandhu (p. 87 of Hall&rsquo;s ed.) speaks of Sriparvata as Sannihita-mallikārjunaḥ.&rsquo; Later on a few passages from Sanskrit and Prakrit literature will be cited to show how the teaching of Tantrik practices led to grost moral debasement and revolting orgies in the name of religion,</p>
<p>The literature on Tantras was vast (vide ‘Principles of Tantra' ed. by A. Avalon, part 1 pp. 390-392 for a long list of Tantras). Both Hindu and Buddhist writers composed numerous works on Tantra and a very large number of subjects came to be included in Tantra works. Buddhist and Hindu Tantras are alike in some respects but they differ in the topics discussed, philosophical doctrines and some religious principles and practices. Tāntra works were introduced into Tibet, Mongolia, China, Japan and South East Asia Originals of many of the Sanskrit Tantrik works are now not available, but the trang lations of some of them in Tibetan are available. 1687 It is aid that even now if proper search is made, three hundred works on Tantra may be discovered (vide Dr. B. Bhattacharya in vol. X. of ŚrI Rāmavarma Institute of Research at Cochin p. 81 ).</p>
<p>It is difficult to give a general definition of Tantras. The word Tantra' is derived usually from &lsquo;Tan&rsquo; to spread and &lsquo;trai&rsquo; (to saye). &lsquo;It spreads (dilates upon) Dacy matters including the tattvas and mantras and affords protection;</p>

<p>therefore it is called Tantra &lsquo;. 1688 They can only be desoribed but one matter is included in almost all of them, vig, the five Makaras&rsquo;. Often they contain an amalgam of religion, philosophy, superstitious dogmas, rites, astronomy, astrology, medicine, prognostications. They resomble the Purānas in several respects. The Buddhists deified many important per sonages of Buddhism and took over in course of time certain Hindu deities like Gaṇeśa and Sarasvati. Tantras are classified by comparatively later works into three groups, Viṣnukrānta, Rathakrānta and Aśvakrānta and 64 Tantras are assigned to each of the three groups (vide Tantrik Texts, vol. I. ed. by Arthur Avalon, Introduction pp. II-IV); but these numbers seem to be fictitious. The same Tantra is put in two classes by certain works. The Kulārṇava-tantra (III. 6-7) speaks of five ūmnāyas ( East, West, South, North and ūrdhva) as the paths to Moksa. The Paraśurāma-kalpasūtra 1689 I. % does the same. Besides, Tantrik worshippers are divided into three classes viz. Saiva, Śākta and Vaisnava. Bagchi states (&ldquo;Studies in Tantras&rsquo;p. 3) that Tantrik literature is classified into Srotas (which are three ) Pitha and Amnāya. The Saundaryalahari, ascribed by some to the great Advaita teacher Saṅkarācārya, refers to sixty-four Tantras (in verse 31 which begins &lsquo;catuṣṣaṣtyā tantraih&rsquo; which, it is said therein, were declared by God Saṅkara for deluding 1690 the world.

Some of the published Hindu Tantras are Kulārnava, Tantrasāra, Nityotsava, Parasuramakalpa-sūtra, Pārānandasūtra, Prapancasāra, Mantra mahodadhi of Mahidhara, Mahānirvāṇatantra, Rudrayāmala, Vāmakeśvaratantra, Sāradātilaka (about 11th century A. D.). Besides, there are works like the Tantrāloka and Malinlvijaya vārtika of Abhinava-gupta of Kashmir Tantrism. They stand somewhat apart from the works enumerated above. Among the published Buddhist tantras are; Advayavajrasangraba, Aryaman juśrimūlakalpa, Guhayasamāja-tantra (probably 6th century A. D.), Jõānasiddhi of Indrabhūti (717 A. D.), Nispan. nayogāvali of Abhayākaragupta (composed between the last quarter of 11th and first of 12th century A. D.), Prajñopāya viniscaya-siddhi of Anangavajra ( about 705 A. D.), Şat-cakra nirūpaña (1577 A.D.), Sadhanamala (containing 312 small works supposed to be from 3rd to 12th century A. D.). Of the Buddhist Tantras Aryamañjusrimūlakalpa and Guhyasamāja tantra 1691 are the oldest according to Dr. B. Bhattacharya (Intro. p. XXXVIII, to Guhya-samājatantra). Most of the above works have been published by Arthur Avalon (Sir. John Woodroffe) and in the Gaikwad Oriental Series. Some of the Hindu Tantras contain sublime philosophical views derived from the Upaniṣads and the Gitā or from the Saṅkhya and Yoga and the final goal according to them is Mukli (liberation from the</p>

As the number of published Hindu Tantras is considerable, reference will be made mainly to a few viz. Kulārṇava, Pārānandasūtra, Prapancasāra, Māhānirvāṇatantra, Vāmakeśyaratantra (Anan. ed.), Sakti. sangamatantra, Sāradātilaka and in the case of the Buddhist tantras to Aryamañjuśrīmūla-kalpa, Guhyasa mājatantra, Prajõopāyaviniscayasiddhi, Jhānasiddhi, Sadhanamāla, Sekodde satikā. The purpose of most Buddhist Tantras is to indicate a short path for attaining Buddha-hood through Yoga practices and they introduce the element of Sakti for Yogio practices and for securing miraculous powers (called siddhis). In the History of Dharmaśāstra not much need be said about Buddhist Tantras except for comparison and stress will have to be laid on the Hindu Tantras alone. The philosophical aspects of Tantrik culture may be studied in the Paraśurāmakalpasūtra, the Vāmakesvara-tantra, Tantrarāja, the works on Kashmir Saivism, works of Bhaskararāya, Bhāvanopaniṣad. This last is a late work dignified with the title of Upaniṣad, as it deals with bhāvanā and summarises the Vāsanāpatala of Tantrarājatantra (vide Intro, to the latter p. 3). There are also Vaisnava Tantras like the Gautamiya-tantra (D. C. ms. No. 1120 of 1886-1892) and Kramadipikā of Kesava (who was a successor of Nimbārka) with the commentary of Govinda Vidyāvinoda (published in the Chowkhamba S. series), which are not referred to in this work from considerations of space. Vide Agnipurāṇa 39. 1-7 for the names of twenty-five Vaiṣnava Tantras dealing with the establishment of Viṣṇu image and other matters and Māheśvara tantra 26. 16-20.</p>
<p>The Hindu tantras which are supposed to have embodied dia logues between Śiva and Devi or Skanda or Bhairava and rarely others as in Dattatreyatantra (D. C. ms. No. 96% of 1887-91) endeavour to show that they bane themselves on the Vedas, Āgamas, Smṛtis and Purāṇas, that there is an easier and quicker way to the final goal of moksa and they often quote Vedic Verses. For example, in the Kulārnava, Siva says to Devi &lsquo;I churned the great ocean of Vedas and Againas with the churning handle of (correct) knowledge. I know the essence of these and took out the Kuladharma, 1692 that the Kaulaśāstras are autho.</p>

The same Tantra further asserts &lsquo;one who has studied the four Vedas but is ignorant of Kuladharma is inferior to &amp; candāla, while a capdala who knows Kuladharmas is superior to a brāhmaṇa. If all dharmas such as sacrifices, pilgrimages and vratas are put on one side and Kuladharma on another side, Kaula (dharma) is superior.&lsquo;1693 It is, therefore necessary to understand what is meant by Kula or Kauladharma. The Guhya-samaja 169t states that Guhya means the three viz. body, speech and mind and &lsquo;samaja&rsquo; means &lsquo;coming together&rsquo;, that Kula may comprehend five matters or three or 101 and that Guhya (as defined) is trikula.&rsquo; God Saṅkara 16s deolared five tattvas, viz. wine, flesh, fish, mudra (hand and finger poses or the woman helper of a yogin) and sexual intercourse, that are aots that become the means for the attainment of the position of a vira and that the mantra of Sakti does not confer perfection unless one follows the practices of Kula; therefore a person</p>

In another place the Mahanirvana 1696 says that the individual soul, prakrti, space, time, alkasa, earth, water, fire and Vayu-these are called &lsquo;Kula&rsquo; and that way of life whereby one looks upon all these as brahma without distinction is called Kulācāra, that confers the four goals viz. dharma, artha, kāma and mokṣa. The Śaktisangama tantra states that Kula means the upāsakas (worshippers ) 1697 of Kāli. The Kulārṇava states *Kula means gotra and that springs from Sakti and Siva; that man is called Kaulika who knows that mokea is secured from that (i. e. Sakti and Siva). Siva is called &lsquo;Akula&rsquo; and Sakti is called &lsquo;Kula&rsquo;; those who contemplate on Kula and Akula are the wise kaulikas.&rdquo; Various other definitions are given in Guhyasamāja ( Ist patala p. 6), in the Preface p. VIII of the Saktisangama-tantra, Tarakhanda But the same Tantra clinches the matter by declaring that &quot; Śakti is known as Kula; her worship and the like are described ; that should be known as Kulācāra&rsquo;, which is difficult of attain ment even for gods. Worship, done with these alone viz. wine, flesh, fish, mudrā and sexual intercourse, is known as Kulācāra.&rdquo; The Pārānanda-sūtra 1698 provides that the highest self is one,</p>

Dakṣiṇa, Vama and Uttard, each succeeding one being superior to each preceding one, that Dakṣiṇa-marga is the one declared in the Veda, smrtis and purāṇas, that the Vāma (way) is declared by the Veda and Agamas, while the third (Uttara) is the one declared by the words of the Veda and of the Guru and that the Guruvākya is that of one&rsquo;s guru who is himself Jiran-mukta and who gives instruction as to &amp; mantra. That sūtra further provides that the Vāmācāra is of two kinds, madhyama ( middling) and utlama (best), that uttana is the one which is concerned with wine, sexual intercourse and hand poses, while madhyama is one where all five, wine, flesh, fish, mudra and maithuna are resorted to. It should be noticed that the Tantras themselves designate the use of five makāras in worship as Vāmācāra and not their orthodox partisans of Yoga, as Heinrich Zimmer alleges in &lsquo;The art of Indian Asia&rsquo; vol. I. p 130. Pārānandasūtra 1699 prescribes that the disciple has to undergo dikṣā (consecration) from a qualified guru, who instructs the disciple as to the mantra, who holds a mouthful of water in his own mouth and passes it into the mouth of the disciple that accepts the mantra while he gulpa down the water. This procedure applies if the guru is a brāhmaṇa, but if the guru is a ksatriya he should recite the mantra in the right ear of the disciple. The Tantraraja-tantra provides that the guru should wait for 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 years according as the intending disciple belongs to the four varnas or to a mixed caste, should test bis qualities and devotion and then com municate to him the mantra; otherwise, both guru and disciple would come to grief (Tantrik Texts, vol VIII, II, 37-38). Most works on Tantra provide that the knowledge conveyed by the guru and worship with five makāras must be kept secret and if made public falling in hell is the result. Vide Parasurama kalpasūtra 1 12 and Saktigangama-tantra. 1700 After undergoing dikṣā and receiving the mantra the disciple has to follow the orders</p>

<p>of the guru till the former has &amp; vision of the deity. 1701 Guru is higher than all other men, mantra is higher than guru, the deity is higher than the mantra and the highest self is higher than the devatā. In order to attain siddhis the guru is to be served by disciples with devotion in all ways. There is only one way viz. bhakti (devotion) for those (disciples) that long for worldly pleasures, heaven or mokṣa, as the Śruti says there is no other way. Jivan-mukti 1702 means to have a vision of the Deity worshipped&rsquo; and one who is liberated, though living, is not tainted by his acts, whether meritorious or otherwise&rsquo;, This doctrine closely follows what is said in some of the Upaniṣads about the man who has realised brahma that he shakes off punya and papa and having cast aside the body he reaches the world of brahma; he does not return i.e. he never again undergoes samsāra&rsquo;. One should strive for that stage. Therefore one who has obtained correct knowledge should become a bhakta (devotee). All these, viz.one in distress, the seekor after knowledge, one who seeks some desired object and one who has obtained correct knowledge, are noble, but the man, who has knowledge about God, when he becomes a devotee, reaches the world of the Highest Self, as the Vedic words say &lsquo;one who knows brahma reaches the Highest&rsquo;. With all this sublime philosophy as the background the Pārānandasūtra frankly provides that the guru, after completing the worship up to the offering of a handful of flowers and having offered into firo somo food, should make a collection of makāras, should again come to the place for worshipping the Deity and offer food into fire, should hand over to the neophyte a bowl for drinking wine,</p>

<p>The Hindu Tantra works present two sides, one philosophical and spiritual, the other popular, practical and more or less magioal, which relies on mantras, mudrās, mandalas, nyāsas, cakras and yantras as physical means to realize one&rsquo;s identity with the Supreme Power or Energy by concentration and as conferring extraordinary powers on the devotee. This may be illustrated by reference to two typical tantras, the Sāradātilaka and the Mahanirvāṇa-tantra. The Mahānirvana-tantra, though it speaks of the five makāras as means of upāsanā and though it states that when the great Tantra is understood, the Vedas, Puranas and śāstras are hardly 1705 of any use, puta forward the striking conception in IV. 34-47 that Parameśvara is one and to be described as sat, cit and ananda, that He is one without &amp; second, is beyond the gunas and is to be known from the Vedanta texts. It further on says that the best mantra is &lsquo;om sac gidekam brahma&rsquo;(III. 14), that those who perform the upāsanā of the Highest Brahma do not require other means of worship (sādbanā); by stioking to this mantra man becomes brahma. In the 4th chap. however, the Mahāpariniryāṇa starts by saying that Durgā is the highest praksti of Paramātmā, she has various names such as Kāli, Bhuvanośvari, Bagalā, Bhairavi, Ohhin namastakā, that she is Sarasvati, Lakṣmi and Sakti, that she aggumes various forms for securing the purpose of her devotees and for the destruction of demong.

<p>to the knowledge of brahma and the man who possesses know ledge of brahma is a liborated soul, though living (he is Jivanmukla). Then there is high praise (IV. 10 ff) of Dev! who is spoken of as the primordial Sakti (adyā paramā sakti ) and all gods including Siva himself derive their powers from this Highest Sakti. A rather astounding statement is made in 1707 the words &lsquo;as there was partaking of wine and the rest in Satya, Tretā and Dyāpara yugas, one should do the same in Kali-yuga, but in accordance with the kula way, and that Kali does not affect those who give to the truthful Yogin the five tattvas ( wine &amp;o.) sanctified according to the kula way&rsquo;. Then &amp; mantra of ten syllables is declared &lsquo;hrim srim krim parama. svari 170$ syābā&rsquo;, by merely listening to which a man becomes jivanmukta. Then by various combinations of the mystio syllables with Parameśvari and Kālikā twelve mantras are produced ( V. 18). But the mantras do not confer siddhi unless the kulācāra way is followed viz. the five tattvas madya'&amp;o. ara offered (V, 22-23). Then a Gayatri Mantra is set out (V. 62-63) as adyayai vidmabe Paramośvaryai dhimabii tan-nah Kali pracodayat il', which is to be muttered thrice daily. The Saṅkhya tattvas, Prakrti, Mahat, Abankara &amp;c. are welded on to the worship of Śakti and the Vedic mantra Hainsaḥ śuoiṣad' (Rg. IV. 40.5) with the Tāntrik bija Hrim ( V. 197). The Tantra gives directions for the sanctification of flesh (V. 203-208, where Rg. I. 22. 20 &lsquo;tadvisnoḥ paramam padam&rsquo; is employed), of fish (V. 209-210) where the mantra Tryambakam' (Rg. VIII, 59. 12) is employed, of mudrā (V. 211-212 where the mantras Tad Viṣpo” paramam' and &lsquo;tad-viprāso&rsquo; Rg. I. 22.20 21, are employed) to be offered to Devi. The Mabanirvāṇatantra</p>

<p>(18th century) being composed after sāktism had come into great ridioule and obloquy is rather sober, 1709 It says that women of good birth should simply smell wine and not drink it, while householder sūdhalas should drink only as much as is contained in five cups, since by drinking too much mon of good family incur the loss of siddhi, and should drink only so long as the wine quaffed does not make their eyes roll or doos not make their mind confused. As to the last tattva (maithuna) the sādhaka was to confine himself to the woman he chooses as his Śakti (VI. 14) and if his wife is alive he is not to touch another woman with a vicious intent, otherwise he would go to hell. 1710 In keeping with its desire to present respectability along with tantrik practicos, the Mahānirvāṇa devotes chapter VIII. to the duties of varnas and āśramas, the duties of the king, the duties of servants in general, provides 1711 that persons of all varnas are to marry within the varpa and dine with persong of the game varna, except when engaged in Bhairavi cakra and Tattva-cakra (VIII. 150), when men of all varṇas are like the best brāhmaṇas, and no consideration of the castes of the participants arises nor any question about ucchiṣta. It prescribes that no one has the adhikāra to engage in the performance of Tattvacakra unless he is &amp; sādhaka endowed with knowledge of brahma. In that cakra the tattvas (wine and the others) should be collected and placed in front of the Devi, the mantra &lsquo;Hamgaḥ&rsquo; (Rg. IV, 40.5) should be recited over all tattvas and the tattvas should be offered to the Highest Self with the verge. &lsquo;Brahmārpanam brahma havir&rsquo; (Bhagvadgitā IV. 24 =Mahānirvāṇa VIII. 214)</p>

<p>and all the sadhakas should engage in drinking and eating. 1913 Chap. IX enumerates and describes ten sainskāras from garbhadhāpa to marriage for membors of the three varnas and nine for sūdras (omitting upanayanı), wherein Vodic mantrag are prescribed as in the Dharmasūtras and smrtis. One interest ing item is what is called Saira marriage, which is of two kinds, one entered into according to the rules of cakra and the other lasting for life. It is further provided that in Saiva marriage1713 no question of rarna or age arises and that if a man has children from a wife married in the brūhma form and also ohildren of a Saiva marriage, it is only the former that take as heirs and the latter are entitled only to food and raiment (IX 261-264). Chapters X, XI, XII of the Mabānirvāṇa deal respectively with śrūddhas, prāyaścitlas for sids and ryjarahāra.</p>
<p>It is necessary now to turn to the Sāradātilaka which belongs to about the 11th century A. D. That work is divided into 25 patalas and contains over 4500 verse. It presents in the begin. ning a somewhat abstruse and involved philosophy. It says that Siva is both nirguna and saquna, the former being different from Prakrti, the latter being 8ssociated with Praksti. Then it describes the order of evolution and manifestation as follows: From the Saguna Parameśvara described as “Sac-cidananda vibhava&rsquo; Sakti 1714 proceeds; from the latter arises nāda (para ) and from nāda arises bindu (para) which is divided into three viz. bindu (apara), nāda (apara ) and bija; the first is indentified with Siva, bija being Sakti and rāda being the coming together of the two (Śiva and Sakti). Sakti creates the worlds, she is sabda-bhahma (I. 56 ) and is called parāsakti (I. 52) and para deyatā (I. 57). She flashes like lightning in the adhāra-oakra. 1715</p>

Rudra, Viṣnu, Brahmā; from the avyakta bindu arise in order the mahat-tattva, abankāra and the other tattvas mentioned in the Sāökbya system. Sakti is all-pervading and yet more subtle than the subtlest, she is the Kundalini coiled like a serpent and manifests herself in the form of the fifty letters of the Sanskrit alphabet (from &lsquo;a&rsquo; to &lsquo;kṣa&rsquo;).</p>
<p>Before proceeding further some explanation of the six cakras which form an important constituent subject of several tantras is needed. There are said to be six cakras (centres) in the human body viz. Adhāra or Mūlādhāra ( at the base of the spine), Svadhisthāna ( near the generative organ ), Manipūra ( near the navel), Anahata (near the beart), Visuddha ( near throat), and Ajõā (between the brows). Besides these, there is Brahma randhra figured as the pericarp of the thousand-petalled lotus</p>
<p>(Continued from last pago) of a markuot in which plate I shows the positions of the six cakras also called lotuses (padma), plates II to VII facing pp. 356, 365, 370, 382, 392, 414 illustrate the six chakras from Mūlādbāra to Ajñā together with their colours, numbers of petals, letters, the devatās in each and other details. These are drawings used by the Yogis. Plate VIII facing p. 430 illustrates &lsquo;sahasrara&rsquo;. Vide C. W. Leadbeater&rsquo;s work on the chakras' (Adgar, 1927), in which the author claims that the illustrations of the cakras represent them as they actually appear to those who can see them and on p. 56 he furnishes a table of the colours of the lotos petals as observed by Lead beater and his friends, and as described in षट्चक्रनिरूपण, शिवसंहिता and TOEIC. The Rudrayāmala (17th Patala, verse 10) speaks of Kandali as * Atbarvavedacakrasthā Kundali paradevatā', verses 21-24 speak of Kundalini passing from Mūladhāra-cakra and reaching the crown of the head that has the thousand-petalled lotus, that when united with Siva he (sādhaka) drinks nectar there, Rudrayāmala (27. 58–70) dilates on the six cakras and the Sabasrāra together with the dalas (petals) and letters assigned to each, A stern warning has to be given that none should try to experiment about the cakras by reading books or try to rouse the Kundalini except under the guidance of a real Master in Yoga, as otherwise very dangerous con sequences would follow. Even as regards wrong methods of Prāṇāyāna and Dhāraṇā, the Vayapurāṇa (chap. XI. 37-60 ) states that Yoga practices by ignorant men result in dullness of lotelligence, deafness, dumbness, blindness, loss of memory, premature old age and disease and it specifies cortala remedies to cure these defects. The present author know &amp; person who practised prāṇāyāma continuously for long periods becoming atono deal, though otherwise be was strong and muscular, and an expert in bar diseason declared on examination that there was so possibility of his recovery by the methods of modern medical scionce.</p>

<p>within the crown of the head. The oakres are often indentified with the nerve plexuses of modern physiology, but the descrip tions in Sanskrit works of the Kundalini and the cakras are meant to refer not to the gross body but rather to what is situated in the subtle body that vanishes when a man dies. The idea of the relevant Sanskrit texts is that the Kundalini Sakti (&lsquo;Kundalin&rsquo; means &amp; serpent) is asleep in the Mūlādhara-oakra coiled like a serpent and has to be roused by the practices of Yoga and deep meditation. 1716 The Sāradātilaka anks in an eloquent stanza the sādbaka to meditate upon the Kundalini which when roused passes from the Mūlādhāra-cakra by means of the Susumnā-nadi (which is in the contre of the spinal column) through all the six cakras, unites with Śiva in the Sahasrāra (thousand-petalled) cakra and then returns to Mlūlādbāra. Each of the six cakras is said to have a certain number of petals viz, 4, 6, 10, 12, 16, 2 (50 in all) in order from Mūlādbāra to Ajñā (vide Rudrayāmala, 17th Patala, verses 55-56). The letters of the alphabet also are 50 (from &lsquo;a&rsquo; to * kṣa') and they are assigned in groups to the six cakras as follows : ha and kṣa to Ajña, 16 vowels to Visuddha in the throat, letters ka to tha (12 in all) to Anahata, letters Da to Pha (10) to Mapipūra, ba to la (6 in all) to Svādbiṣthāna, letters va to sa (4) to Mūlādhāra. Some tantrag state the colour of each of the six cakras and identify them with the five elements and the mind. These speculations of the Yoga and Tantras are</p>

Then the Sāradātilaka describes āgana, mandapa, kuṇda, mandala, pithas (on which images of gods are to be placed), diksa (initiation), prāṇapratiṣthā (vivifying images), production of sacrificial fire. The sāradā tilaka (I. 109 and V. 81-91), the Varivasyārahasya (II..80), the Paraśurāmakalpasūtra (I. 4, &lsquo;Şat-trimsat tattyāni visvam&rsquo;) and other Tantrik and Āgamic works enumerate 36 tattyag (including those of the sānkhya system). From chap. VII. to XXIII mantras of different deities, their formation, use and resulta, abhiṣekas and mudrās are described. Yantras are dealt with in chap. XXIV and Yoga in chap. XXV. It must be said to the credit of the Sāradātilaka that it treats of only mantras and mudrās and hardly anywhere treats of the other makāras. The Sāradātilaka has been profusely quoted as an authoritative Tantra by medieval Dharmaśāstra writers like Govindananda, Raghunandana, Kamalakara, Nilakantha, Mitramiśra and orthers. In J. G. J. R.

<p>The Tantras seem to be not unaware that in prescribing the five makāras as leading to mukti (final liberation) they were playing with fire. The Kulārṇave itself remarks (II. 117-119 and 122) If by merely drinking wine a man were to attain siddhi (miraculous powers, perfection), then all wretched drunkards may attain siddhi. If, by merely eating meat a holy goal were to be secured then all meat-eaters in the world would be holy men. If by mere intercourse with a woman (called sakti) moksa was to result, then all men in the world may attain liberation. To follow the path (of Kula) is indeed more unattainable than walking on the edge of a sword, than clinging to a tiger&rsquo;s neck, than holding a serpent (in one&rsquo;s hand)&rsquo;. The Kulārṇava prefaces the preceding dicta by the words &lsquo;Many, who are devoid of traditional knowledge and who profane ( the sāstra ) by false ideas, imagine that the Kaulika dootrine is this and that, relying on their (poor) intellect&rsquo; (II. 116 ).</p>

<p>It would not be entirely out of place if &amp; fow words were devoted to the Bauddha Tantras, particularly of the Vajrayāna. It has already been shown above (pp. 943–44 note: 1516 ) that all Buddhists, whether of the hinayāna&rsquo; or mahāyāna type, were required to observe strict rules and regulations such as those of pancasilas and of taking refuge with Buddha, Dharma and Sangha and of daśasllas (for monks). The goal of nirvana (particularly under Mahāyāna doctrines) could be reached only after a very long time or after several births. As luxuries viz. flesh, fish, wine and women had been banned, the general mass of the people and probably monks also were tired of the strict mode of life and long waiting for the goal. Buddhist Tantras like the Guhyasamāja (that belongs to the Vajrayāna school) provided an easy process by which liberation and even Buddha.. bood could be secured in a short time and even in 1720 one life and averred that Bodhisattvas and Buddhas attained the seat of dharma by enjoying all objects of pleasure as they 1721 pleased. The word Vajra means both diamond&rsquo; and &lsquo;thunderbolt&rsquo;. The first meaning appears to have been principally meant in the Guhyasamāja but the 2nd meaning also must have been some times intended. Vajra denotes anything which is hard like a diamond. In the Guhyasamājatantra the word Vajra, either singly or in compounds, Occurs hundreds of times. Kaya (body), Vak (speech) and citta (mind) are called trivajra' (Gulya, pp. 31, 35, 36, 43).

It also means the male organ in the mystic language of Saktas. Though the original Buddhist rules insisted on shimga, Guhyasamāja permitted several kinds of flesh, such as that of elephants, horses, dogs and even human 1723 flesh. Early Buddhism insisted upon truthfulness and continence ( brahma cerya); vajrayana, being an innovating revolt, allowed the killing of all animals, speaking untruth, intercourse with women (including even incest with the mother, sister 1724 and daughter) and appropriating:wealth not donated by any one. This was called vajramārga (the path of vajra), which is said to have been the dootrine of all Buddhas.</p>
<p>The Prajñopāya (I. 20 ) describes the stato reached by the Vajrayāna method as follows. &lsquo;It is neither duality por 100, duality, it is full of peace, beneficent, present everywhere, to be realised by one&rsquo;s own self, steady (unchanging), undisturbed and full of Prajina (wisdom) and Upaya (activity with compas.</p>

<p>Śtate reached by Vajrayāna method 1087 sion) and it further provides (V. 22-23) that by those who hanker after liberation perfection of wisdom must be sought (resorted to or adored) in all ways. This perfection of wisdom is everywhere present assuming the form of woman&rsquo;. Prajña was linked up with an intense state of emotion called Sukha or Mahāsukha (great bliss ). &quot; It being of the nature of endless bliss is designated mahāsukha; it is beneficent all round, most eminent and conduces to complete enlightenment&rsquo; (Prajñopāya. I. 27) and this all Buddha knowledge which is by its nature to be experienced by one&rsquo;s inmost self is called Mahāsukha (great bliss) since it is the most eminent of all pleasures' (Jñānasiddhi VII. 3). The word Prajñā is feminine in gendør and therefore some Vajrayāna writers identified Prajñā with woman; by erotio symbolism and far-fetched analogies the cult of woman was started.</p>
<p>Dr. H. V. Guenther has published a book styled &lsquo;Yuga naddha&rsquo; propounding the Tāntrik view of life based only on Buddhist Tantras and endeavours to prove in that work (of about 190 pages) that the Buddhist Tāntrikas try to restore life in its entirety, which is neither an indulgence in passions nor a rejection and escape, but a complete reconciliation to the hard facts of life, that the sexual aspect of the Tantras is but the corrective against the one-sided intellectualism and rationalism of mere philosophy which is unable to cope with the problems of everyday life and that the symbol of Yuganaddha points to the unique harmony and interpenetration of masculinity and feminity, of blunt truth and symbolic truth, of intellect and humanity. It is not possible even to summarize this work or criticize it here. The core of the doctrine of the Vajrayana tantras is found in the passages quoted in notes 1720-21, 1723-84. The argument is: according to these Tantras perception of wholeness is the most joyous of all human experiences and man&rsquo;s experience will not be full but only partial if he has dio experience of feminity i. e. of everything fomale. He may expertendo feminity through all female members of his family. Thorefore, it is not to be wondered at, says Dr. Guenther, that this er. perionoe so often has an incestuous character'. Then he offers (on pp. 106-11%) a lengthy explanation of what he means which, the prosont author has to confoss, is not quite clear to his moderato mental abilities. Dr. Guenther appears to be steeped in all the latest theories of modern psychologists like those of Freud and tries to expound that Buddhist author of the 8th century A. D. Like Anangavafra and Indrabhu had plumbed the depths at the</p>
<p>1068</p>
<p>History of Dharmafāstra 1 Sec. VI, Ch. XXVI</p>
<p>psychical life on the lines of modern psycho-analysis. Granting for a moment all that Dr. Guenther says about bi-sexuality, about sexual partnership being the best expression for the most intimate relation between two opposites, about woman being for the malo a material object and a goddess, the present writer feels that one question appears to have been not satisfactorily answered or explained, viz. why did not the Buddhist Tantrikas simply exhort the sādhaka to understand the emotions, view points and value of woman as a mother, sister, wife, daughter or as a woman in general and why did they frequently and blatantly harp upon sexual intercourse of even an incestuous kind as a quick method of realizing the goal ?</p>
<p>The Guhyagamāja-tantra puts forward a quick and short method for realising Buddhahood and for the attainment of miraculous powers (siddhis) through the processes of Yoga. The siddhis are said to be of two kinds, Sāmānya (ordinary, 1725 such as becoming invisible) and Uttama (highest i, e. attaining Buddhahood). Four means for securing ordinary siddhis are mentioned and they are called Vajra-catuska. It is further provided that the best ṣiddhi is acquired by the nectar of knowledge due to the six angas 1726 of Yoga (and by no other way) viz. Pratyābāra, Dhyāna, Prāṇāyāma, Dhāraṇā, Anusmrti and Samādbi. It is worthy of note that the first three angas of yoga mentioned in the Yogagātra viz. yama, niyama 1771 and asana are omitted and a new one, Anusmrti, is added Yama could not be included because to the Guhyasamaja it did not matter if the sādhaka ate flesh, or indulged in sexual intercourse or told lies, while in Yogasūtra yamas are ahimsā, salya (truthfulness), asteya (not appropriating anything that does not belong to one), brahmacarya (sexual purity) and aparigraha (non-acceptance of gifts).

<p>niyamas are svādhyāya (Vada study) and (Isvaraprapidhāna ) devotion to or surrender to God. Many Bauddhas reviled the Veda and acknowledged no Supreme Deity. The Guhyasamāja introduced Yogio practices for quickly securing Buddhahood. The idea of allowing flesh and sexual intercourse seems to have been that the Yogin is to be indifferent as to what he does 80 long as he is striving for the goal of Buddhahood, for development of his psychic life and that he may disregard all social conyon tions and rules. 1728 Another innovation of the Vajrayāna was the introduction of upāsanā of Sakti for liberation through Yoga. The Guhya-samāja provides that if even after making efforts for six months, the sādhaka has no realisation, ho may repeat his offorts for three times more and if even after that he has no enlightenment he should resort to Hathayoga and then he would attain correct knowledge through Yoga. A further innovation was the theory of the five Dhyāni-buddhas, 1729 emanating from</p>
<p>the Bhagavān, who represent the five Skandhas or fundamental principles of which the whole creation is composed and each of whom was associated with a female Sakti. The teaching of the Guhyasamāja is that if psychical power and miraculous siddhis are to be developed females must be associated with those who undertake Yogic exercises to achieve their enda. Thus the prophecy of the founder of Buddhism pronounced, when yielding to the pressure and entreaties of his favourite disciple Ananda for allowing women to be members of the sangha and to be nuns, that on account of this innovation his system would atand fast only for five hundred years, though otherwise it would have lasted for a thousand years, was literally fulfilled (vide Cullavagga</p>

<p>X. 1. 6 in Vinaya Texts, vol. III, S. B. E. XX. p. 325). If we accept 483 B. O. as the date of Buddha&rsquo;s Parinirvana ( as many scholars hold) or 477 B. C. (as A. Foucher bolds) 500 years therefrom would bring us to the first century A. D. and it is clear that by a century or two after that time much of Buddha&rsquo;s teaching appears to have been almost completely swamped by doctrines of Mahāyāna and Vajrayāna Tantras, By a strange irony of fate Buddha&rsquo;s &lsquo;dharma-cakra-pravartana&rsquo; came to be transformed into &lsquo;adharma-cakra-pravartana&rsquo; by many of his so-called followers of the Vajrayana. In the Mabā-parinibbana autta V. 23 ( S. B. E. vol. XI. p. 91 ) the Buddha was very strict and warned bhikkhus not to see bhikkhunis, not to talk to them if they could not avoid seeing them, and to be wide awake if &amp; nun talked to them. Buddha severely rebuked one of his disciples for showing his miraculous powers (vide p. 1037 and 2. 1672 above), but Guhyagamāja and other Buddhist tantras make provision for endowing the sādbaka with miraculoug powers, such as causing rainfall in case of drought (Guhya Bamāja p. 84), killing an enemy by magical rites over an effigy of the enemy (ibid. p. 96). Besides, the Guhyasamāja knows the gix cruel or terrible magic acts (called &lsquo;satkarmāṇi), viz. Sānti (rite for averting disease or black magic), vaśikarana (bewitching women and men and even gods ), stambhana (stop ping the movements or actions of others), vidveṣana (creating enmity between two friends or two persons who love each other ), uccātana (making a person or enemy flee from the country, town or village), mārana (killing or causing permanent injury to living beings). The Guhyasamaja mentions these six ( putting * Akarṣaṇa ' for &lsquo;vidveṣana&rsquo;) respectively at pp. 168, 165, 96, 87 (Akarṣaña), 81, 130. Vide Sadhanamālā pp. 368-369 for the same and for the shape of mandalas and times for each of the six cruel rites. Even the rather sobor Saradātilaka-tantra mentiong these six (23. 12%), defines them (23. 123-125), provides that Rati, Vāṇi ( speech or Sarasvati), Ramā, Jyoṣths, Durgā and Kāli are respectively the six deities of these six cruel acts and must be worshipped at the commencement, that six periods of ten ghatikās from suprise are respectively appropriate to these six and so also are certain seasons (23, 126-139). It is most astounding that the Prapaõoasāra (23.5) asoribed to the great advaita teacher Saṅkardoārya describes at length a mantra called Trailokya-mohana for accomplishing the aboy si cruel acts.</p>

<p>Both Hindu and Buddhist Tantrag1730 lay great emphasis on the importance and qualifications of the guru. The Bauddha Tantras have the highest praise for the guru. The Jūlnasiddhi (13.9-12) proscribes high qualifications and the Prajiopāyavini soaya-siddhi (III, 9-16 ) contains a grand eulogy of the guru, identifying him with Buddha and calling him omniscient and 80 on. The Advayasiddhi of Laksmiðkarā (about 729 A. D.), who started the astounding doctrine that one should offer worship to one&rsquo;s own body wherein all gods reside, says that in the three worlds there is none higher than the ācārya. In the Nityotgava of Umānanda-nātha, pupil of Bhāgurānanda-nātha (i. . Bhāskararāya as he was called before he took diksa) the guru Bhāskararāya is praised in the following hyperbolical terms 1731 to whom no part of the earth was unseen (owing to his yogic sight), there was no king who was not his slave, to whom no śāstra was unknown; why use more words, whose form was the highest Sakti herself.&rsquo; But the Jõāna-siddhi and Kulārpava (XII. 128 ) ward against gurus who falsely pretend to know the truth and give instruction in dharma from greed for money. The Kulārpava ( ullāsas XI and XII) are devoted to the quali fications and greatness of guru. The Sāradātilaka also sets out the qualifications of the tāntrika guru (II. 142–144 ) and of the disciple (:III. 145–152). 1732 The guru among other matters &lsquo;must know the essence of all Āgamas and the principles and meaning of all śāstras, he must be one whose words come out true, who has a quiet mind, who has profoundly studied the Veda and its meaning, who follows the path of Yoga and whose bearing is as beneficent as that of a deity. Among the many requirements about a disciple, 1733 one is that he must keep secret the mantra and pājā imparted by his guru. The disciple places the guru&rsquo;s feet on his head and surrenders his body, wealth and even life to</p>

<p>the guru, The necessity of a guru for the aoquisition of esotorio philosophy is stronged by the Upaniṣads also. For, example the Kathopaniṣad 1734 says this knowledge cannot be obtained by ratiocination, it can be understood well only when expounded by another&rsquo;; the Chandogy&amp; (IV.9.3) says &lsquo;Sir, I have heard from men like you that only knowledge that is learnt from a teacher leads to real good&rsquo;. The Lingapurana1735 and others say that guru is identical with Siva and the rewards of devotion to Siva and to the guru are the same. The Kularnava (XI.46) emphasizes that the order of the succession of gurus, the Āgamus, Āmnāya, mantra and practiceg-all these when learnt from the lips of a guru become fruitful and not otherwise. The Prapanca. sāra provides the disciple should consider in his mind that guru, devatā and mantra are one and should repeat a hundred times the mantra that he received by the favour of the guru.'</p>
<p>The Vedānta system requires for its understanding high intellectual and moral attainments and could be followed by only a few gifted souls. It is claimed that Tantras provide &amp; method which assists mon of ordinary intellect and which utilizes visual and physical processes for the attainment of spiritual experience, for the development of psychio forces and for the quick attainment of liberation by suoh practices as the repetition of mantras, mudrās, nyasa, mandalas, cakras and yantras. The respect for the guru sometimes reached amongat Tāntrik writors to extreme and disgusting lengths as the note below will indicate.1736</p>

<p>Perverse Tantrik practices and Sanskrit Literature</p>
<p>1073</p>
<p>The teaching of Tantrika texts about the five makāras must have created &amp; very unhealthy and debased state among all classes, particularly the lower orders of Society. The centuries from the 7th to the 12th A. D. were the peak period of Tantrik works and cults, both Hindu and Buddhist. In &amp; certain cult of the Vajrayāna the gurus wore a blue yesture. A story is narrated of a guru (a monk) of the sammitiya sect who went dressed in a blue dress to a courtezan. He did not return to the monastery at night. When asked in the morning by his disciples why he put on a blue dress, he explained the great spiritual merit of the blue-coloured dress. Since then his followers began to wear blue dress and in their book called &lsquo;Nilapatadarsana&rsquo; it is written the god Kāmadeva (Eros) is a jewel, a courtezan is &amp; jewel, wine is a jowel; I bow to these three jewels; other so-called jewels are three glass beads&rsquo;. It should be remembered that for devout Buddhists, Buddha, Dharma and Sangha are three Ratnas (jewels). The followers of the Nilapatadarśana deemed these last three to be as worthless as glass beads. Vide Bhikṣu Rahula Sāṅkstyāyana&rsquo;s paper &lsquo;On Vajrayāna or Mantrayana ' in J. A. vol. 225 (1934) p. 216 where this is narrated Valge gurus must have gone about deluding people with rosy prospects of bliss and liberation by the easy method of drinking wino, eating flesh and free association with all sorts of women. The Indian literature of those centuries is full of condemnation and caricatures of the methods of Tāntrik worship by means of wine, flesh and sexual laxity. A few instances may be cited here.

D.) states in one verse what the Tantrik gurus and their followers did “Gurus declare that liberation follows by the drinking of wine from the same goblet by various craftsmen such as washermen, weavers, workers in hides, kāpālais, in the procedure of cakrapūjā, and by dalliance with women without the least scruple and by always leading a life of festivities.&rdquo; 1739 The Rāja-tarangini (middle of 12th</p>

In V. 66 Kalhana says that during 1740 the reign of Avantivarman of Kashmir, siddhas ( persons possessed of mira culous powers like animā) such as Bhatta Kallata were born for the benefit of the world. In describing the effects of the rule of a good king Yasaskara (1939–948 A. D.), Kalhana 1741 remarks that during his reign were not seen housewives figuring as divinities at the rite of gurudikṣā and shaking their heads for detracting from the eminent character (attributed to) of their husbands.&rsquo; King Kalasa of Kashmir (1063-1089 A. D.) became a pupil.of Pramadakaptha, son of Amarakantha who was a good brahmana, but Kalaśa, who by nature was evil-minded, was instructed in evil practices by his guru Pramadakantha and the latter made the former ignore the distinction between women who are approachable and who are not. In this connection, Kalhana bitterly 1742 bewails &ldquo;what other unscrupulousness of this guru (of Kalasa) should be described by me, when, leaving aside all scruples, he committed incestuous intercourse with his own daughter.&rdquo; This establishes that in the 11th century A.

<p>History of Dharmatūxtra (Soc. VI, CL XXVI</p>
<p>in Kashmir there were Tantrik gurus that literally carried out what the Guhyasamājatantra quoted in note 1724 apparently recommended to Buddhist Yogis. In the drama called Moba parajaya by Yaśabpāla under king Ajayadeva, successor of Kumarapāla, among the dramatis personge is a kaula who declares his doctrine to be eating flesh every day, drinking wine without any qualms and allowing the mind free scope.178 Apararka quotes a verse which shows that, in the midst of numerous cults, it was difficult to be consistent: &ldquo;A person may be at heart a Kaula ( follower of the Kula doctrine), in outward appearance he may look a Saiva, and he may follow Vaidika rites in his usual practices. One should live grasping what is essential like the cocoabut 1741 fruit&rdquo;. It appears that great scholars and poets had a speaking admiration for Tantrika worship. The great writer Vidyāpati of Mithilā appears to be a Vaisnava from his devotional songs, but wrote the Saivazarvasvasāra (80 he day be called a Saiva), and wrote also Durgābhaktitarangipi (and thus appears to have been a Sākta) and composed also a Tantrik 1745 work. The very first verse of Vidyāpati&rsquo;s &lsquo;Purusa pariksa&rsquo; contains an invocation of Ādi-Sakti' Bengal and Assam were the strongholds of Sākta doctrines and even DOW Kāli worship is still in vogue there, but it was the great Bengal</p>

<p>Possible motives for debased Tantra practices</p>
<p>1077</p>
<p>king Ballklasena who discarded Devipurāṇa 88 an authority in his encyclopaedic work on gifts called Dānasāgara. 1746</p>
<p>It is possible that the founders of the Tantrik or Sakta cult: of the five makāras threw defiance at the terrible aspect of God or the Highest Spirit, that rules the destinies of men and things and that made men sometimes suffer terribly even if they led lives of virtuo, to do the worst for their disregard of conyen tional morality and social practices and hoped by their Yoga exercises to attain to high psychical powers and bliss. 1747 There is another possible motive also. Masses of common people were being drawn towards Buddhism. The founders of Hindu Tāntrik cults wanted to retain them within the Hindu fold. As common people drank wine and ate meat, they were told that they would attain higher spiritual levels even while indulging in meat and drink provided they followed Tantrik gurus and practices.</p>
<p>The idea was that Sakti was all and was for all; bhoga (enjoy. ment) need not be given up, as man is part of Devi or Siva. Bloga should be sublimated, that is all that is required in Kaula. śāstra. The Tāntrikas 1748 substitute a yoga of enjoyment (bhoga) for the yoga of abstinence and asceticism, When indulging in the left-hand path practices the sādhaka is supposed or held to be destroying the egoistic elements of the soul.</p>
<p>The Mahānirvāṇatantra and a few others endeavour to stom the tide of sexual immorality and promiscuity. For example, Rāmeśvara, the commentator of Paraśurāmakalpasūtra, says that one that has not conquered his senses has no adhikāra for Kaulamārga (p. 153). This is in direct conflict with what even the Mahānirvāṇatantra says that all men from brāhmaṇas to the untouchables have adhikāra for Kula practices. Modern apologists for Tāntrism emphasize that the instructions embodied in the Gubyasamāja, the directions for the mode of life to be led by followers of Vajrayāna, apply only to the Yogis who have attained some degree of yogic perfection.

<p>History of Dharmaśāstra (Boa VI, Ch. XXVI</p>
<p>reply is who is to decide that a particular person had attained the minimum spiritual level except the man himself and, pupposing that all the directions were meant for Yogis, why was it necessary to say in a blatant manner and language that a Yogi practising Vajrayana may engage in what common and less sophisticated people deem to be incest? This is not the place to reply to all apologists for ancient and medieval Tāntrik works. But a few must be dealt with because they are liable to create misunderstandings, if allowed to go uncriticized. In his Preface to Principles of Tantra&rsquo; Part 2, Sir John Woodroffe statos (p. IX.) that the use of flesh, fish and wine was common in the Vedic age and that the Mahābhārata and some Puriṇas like the Kālikā, Mārkandeya and Kūrma refer to consumption of wine, meat and fish. This looks like special pleading and is misleading. The question is: was sirū offered to the gods in every day or periodic sacrifices as an offering in the Roveda or any other Veda. In the Vedic age wine may have been known and even drunk, but what is material to recognize is that there is a difference made between Soma and surā. Vida Sat. 176 Br. &ldquo;Soma is truth, prosperity, light and surā is untruth, nigary and darkness&rdquo; (V. 1. 5. 28). While Soma is mentioned hundreds of times in the Rgveda, has the 9th mandala of the Rgveda specially reserved for its praises and was offered to gods, the word surū occurs only six times in the Rgveda and it is nowhere expressly stated that it was offered to any god as &amp; religious offering; on the contrary, in a hymn to Varuṇa, burā is put for ward as leading to the commission of sin just as anger and gambling do (Rg. VII. 86.6 &lsquo;na sa svo. dakso Varuna dhrutih sā surā manyur-vibhidako acittih). In bis zeal for the vindica tion of Tantrism Arthur Avalon is injudicious enough to misinterpret simple words. In the Intro. to Principles of Tantra&rsquo;p. VII be quotes Rg. I. 166.7 &ldquo;arcantyarkam madirasya pitaye&rdquo; and translates &ldquo;worshipping the Sun before drinking madira (wine).&rdquo; The word here is madira (and not &lsquo;madirā&rsquo;), it is an adjective and means &ldquo;exhilarating&rdquo;. The word “Madirā&rdquo; never occurs in the Rg. while &ldquo;madira&rdquo; as an adjec tive, occurs at least sixteen times and qualifies Soma, Indu, Amsu, Rasa or Madhu, generally expressed (and rarely implied). There is no word for &ldquo;before.&rdquo; That quarter means &ldquo;they (the worshippers or Maruts) worship (Indra) who is worthy of praise (and a friend of the Maruts) in order that he may come for</p>
<p>1749, H</p>
<p>r vatia: HATSTE TOT A: Timu V, 1, 5, 28.Madira and Sura in ancient times</p>

<p>drinking the exhilarating (Soma). The word madirā (for wine ) hardly ever occurs in any genuing work of Vedic times. Its earliest oocurrence is probably in the Mahābbārate. Reference is also made by modern apologists to the offering of surā in the Sautrāmaṇl iṣti in honour of Indre But the circumstances are peculiar, Sautrāmani is only one out of numerous sacrifices and the occasions for performing it were rare i.e. it was per formed at the end of Rājagūya and also at the end of Agnicayana and when a priest who had drunk too much of soma vomited. The most important fact, however, is that the remnants of surā offered in Sautrāmani were not drunk by the priests engaged in it but a brāhmaṇa bad to be hired for drinking the remnants and if no brāhmaṇa could be secured then the remnants were to be poured over an ant-hill (vide H. of Dh. vol. II, p. 1226 for details). The Kathakagamhitā 1750 contains an interesting passage &ldquo;Therefore an elderly person and a youngster, the daughter-in-law and the father-in-law, drink liquor and remain babbling together; thoughtlessness is sin; therefore a brāhmaṇa does not drink surā with the thought that otherwise (if I drink it) I may be tainted by sin&rsquo;; therefore this is for ksatriya; one should say to a brāhmaṇa that surā, if drunk by &amp; ksatriya, does not harm the latter.&rdquo; These passages show that not only the priests did not drink surā even in Sautrāmapi but that it had become difficult to hire &amp; brāhmapa for drinking it by the time of the Kathaka-gamhitā. The passage of the Vajasaneya Samhita 19.5 relied on at p. VII (of Intro to Principles of Tantra&rsquo; part II) also refers to Saytrāmaṇi and to no other gagri fice. The mantra is &ldquo;Brahma kṣatram pavate toja, indriyam surayā - somaḥ suta asuto madāya&rdquo; and means that: &ldquo;Soma when mixed with surā becomes a strong drink and leads to intoxication.&rdquo; The Chandogya V. 10. 9' (q. above p. 1578 n. 943') counts the drinker of surā among the five grave sinners. There fore, there is hardly any analogy between the offering of wine in Sautrāmaṇi and the teaching about offering wine. to Doyl as provided in the Tantras. Similarly, the : reference to the Atharyaveda as containing magical rites. does not help at all. Society had advanced far beyond that-stage and Manu XI. 63 looked upon abhicāra (i. o. performance of a magio rite like Syenayāga for killing a person) and mūlakārmda (i. e. bringing</p>

Wine was drunk by people in the Mahābhārata times, but not as part of a religious ritual as in the Tantras. Vide pp. 964-966 of H. of Dh. vol. III for a note on &lsquo;intoxicating drinks.&rsquo; The reference to Mārkaṇdeya and other purāṇas is of no avail as evidence, since at least the present author holds that those parts of the Puranas were written and interpolated after Tantrik rites had taken a firm hold on some sections of the Hindu society. The reference to sexual intercourse in the Mahāvrata 1751 is most misleading. In the Tantras like the Kulārṇava and the Guhya. samāja it is the sādhaka himself who is to practise maithuna as one of the ways of securing marvellous powers and higher spiritual attainments. But in the Mahāvrata the sexual inter course is by strangers to the sacrifice (and not by the yajamāna nor by any of the priests ), is a purely symbolical act and beans 20 analogy to a sādhaka himself engaging in maithuna as a religious rite to placate the Devi. Even &amp; late reformist work like the Mahānispāṇa (VIII. 174-175) expressly says that those of the five tattvas which a sādhaka can secure, such as flesh and others, should have recited over them the mantra &lsquo;ām, hrim, krom, svābā&rsquo; a hundred times, that he should reflect that every thing is &amp; product of brahma, should close his eyes, should offer those to Kāli and should himself drink and eat them. As the Tantrik prescriptions of the makāras for attainment of mira culous powers and of liberation had shocked people and bad brought the tantras into great disrepute, later Hindu Tāntrik works like the Saktisangamatantra (between 1555-1607 A. D.) began to offer symbolic interpretations. They 1752 say that the</p>

<p>Symbolic interpretations of medya, maithuna dc.</p>
<p>1081</p>
<p>words &lsquo;madya, mudrā, maithuna&rsquo; &amp;o. are not used in this ordinary popular sense but in a special esoterio sense. .. For example, mudrā has several sensos, viz. a mixture of jaggery and ginger, or of salt and oil-cake or garlic and tamarind fruit, or wheat and māṣa beans, that madya (wine) is not what is prepared from mādbavi ( spring flower) but it springs from the joyful experience (or rasa) of Sakti, when effort is made to awaken the Kundalini. It may be admitted that some Tantrik works and writers divide men into three classes, paśu (the bestial ones), vira (those that have made great progress on the path of spiritual discipline) and daiva (those who are godlike). As regards these three, the five makāras are assigned by some apologistio writers different meaninge. D. N. Boge in his work *Tantras, their philosophy and occult secrets' boldly' asserts (p. 110) that the real significance of the five makāras has been deliberately perverted by vicious people and explains (p: 111) that madya is the nectarine stream issuing from the cavity of the brain where the soul resides, matsya means suppression of vital airs, māṁsa means yow of silence,' &lsquo;maithuna&rsquo; means &lsquo;meditation on the acts of creation and destruction. ..:</p>
<p>The Tāntrikas clothe their practices in bombastic and high. sounding words. The five makāras are called pañca-tattvas; kuladravyas or kulatattvas. Maithuna is generally referred to 28 parcamatattva, the woman with whom sexual intercourse iṣ to be had or who was at least to be associated with a male in Tantra worship is called Sakti (vide Kulārnava VII 39-43 and Mahānirvana VI, 18-20) or praksti or latā and this special ritual is called &lsquo;Latāsādhana&rsquo; (Mahānirvāṇa I. 52). Wine is called tirthavāri (holy water) or kāraṇa (VIII.168 and VI. 17.) The Mahānirvana-tantra, though a reformist work and in certain oases asking the king to punish drunkards (XI. 113–121),</p>

<p>waxes eloquent over wine and praises it as Tara in the form 1750 of a fluid substance, as the saviour of individual souls, as the mother (or producer) of bhoga (enjoyment) and mokṣa (libera tion) and as the remover of misfortunes and diseases and after some further praise of wine winds up by saying that those men who drink wine according to the rules and with a well-controlled mind are gods on earth (XI. 108). For the worship of Sakti the five tattvas are absolutely necessary (Mahānirvana-tantra V. 21-24 quoted in note 1695 above and 1754 Kulārnava V. 69 and 76). Some tantras say that the meaning of tattva differs according as the person concerned is Tamasika (a paśu kind of worshipper), Rājasika (a vira as he is called), sāttvika (a divya, a person who is godlike). Madya means according to various Tantrik Texts real wine as well as a substitute like cocoanut water or any other liquid; it also means that intoxicating know ledge that comes of Yoga practices, whereby the worshipper becomes senseless as regards the external world. Maisa is the Bot whereby the sādhaka surrenders himself and his action to Lord Siva Matsya (fish, of which the first part &lsquo;mat&rsquo; means &lsquo;mino&rsquo;) is that psychical state by which the worshipper sympa thizes with the pleasure and pain of all beings. Maithuna is the union of the Sakti Kundalini (the woman inside a man&rsquo;s body) in the Mūlādbāra-cakra with the supreme Śiva in the Sahasraracakra in the highest centre of the brain and is the stream of the sweet juice that drops from the Sabasrāra. Preparar tion of hemp (called vijayā or &lsquo;bhang&rsquo;) is madya for some. The Mahāniryāṇa says (VIII. 170 and 173) that &lsquo;madhura-traya&rsquo; may be substituted for wine and for &lsquo;Maithuna&rsquo; meditation on the foot of the image of ) Devi and japa of the desired mantra may be substituted. The Kaulavallnirnaya (III. 111) boldly states that if a man, after partaking of vijaya (bhāng) ongages in meditation, he sees directly before him the form of the goddess as described in the Dhyanamantra.

<p>Kaulajñananirnaya and Bhaskarariya 1755 in his commentary on Lalitigahasranama say that when Kundalini in roused by &amp; yogin and it reaches the thousand-patalled cakra (Sahasrara ) from whioh (that has on its perioarp the moon) drops neotar which is figuratively spoken of aa madya (vide notes 1716, 1752). The Kularnava at first asserts (I. 105-107) Mukti does not result from the study of the Veda nor by the study of sastras, it results from (correct) knowledge alone, that the aśramas are. not a means of mokṣa por are the darśanas the means, nor all the sastras, that it is knowledge alone that is the cause, that it is the knowledge imparted by the teaching of the guru that confers mukti, all (other) vidyās are mockery.&rsquo; Then in the Vedāntic strain it affirms (I. 111-112) &ldquo;two words ( respectively) lead to bondage or liberation viz. (this is) mine&rsquo; or nothing la mine&rsquo;. A person falls in bondage by the thought &lsquo;this is mine&rsquo; and becomes liberated by realising nothing is mine and that that is proper action that does not lead to bondage and that is real lore that leads to liberation.&rdquo; After these high thoaghts the bame Tantra (II. 22-23 and 29 ) proceeds to Kaula doctrine. If &amp; man is a yogin he does not (ordinarily) enjoy life, while one who enjoys life does not know yoga; but the Kaula doctrino combines both yoga and bhoga and is superior to all (other doctrines); in the Kaula dootrine bhoga turns into yoga directly, what is sin ( acc. to ordinary people) becomes meritorious, samsāra turns into mokṣa. Kaula knowledge enlightens him whose mind is purified by the mantras of Saiva worship, Durg worship &amp;o.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Kulārnava appears to be in two minds to ordinary men like the present writer. While in one breath as shown in note 1718 it frankly recommends the drinking of wine and eating of flesh to the followers of Kaula doctrine, it also endeavours to give an esoteric meaning to the makāras as follows (V. 107-112): Frequently reaching the brahmarandhra from the mūladhara, there arises the bliss of the union of the Kuṇdalini-Sakti with the moon in the form of Intelligence (at, Siva); the person who is intent on tasting the nectar oozing from the lotus in the</p>

When the adept 1756 in Yoga outting the beast ( ago) doing good or evil actions with the sword of knowledge (of reality ) makes his mind merge in the Highest, he is said to be eator of pala (the Highest, flesh). The (Yogin) who restraining the several sonses by his mind concentrates them on the Self, becomes &lsquo;matayāsı&rsquo;, 1737 others are only killera of living beings. The Sakti (the woman associated with a sādhaka ) of a beastly man is unonlightened but that of the Kaulika is enlightened; he who honoura (or resorts to ) such &amp; Sakti is really &amp; worshipper of Sakti. When a man is filled through and through with the bliss due to the union of the Highest Sakti with the Self (Siva), that is called Maithuna (copulation); all other men are merely licentious persons.</p>
<p>. The apologists for unpopular Tantrik practices offer explana. tions of the five &lsquo;makāras&rsquo; more or less on the lines of the Kulār anava. For example, in his Introduction to the Principles of Tantra' (part II) Arthur Avalon (Sir Jobn Woodroffe) gives (pp. OVII-CVIII) an esoteric explanation of the word &lsquo;drinking&rsquo; used in such a verge as that in the Paranandasūtra, &lsquo;Having drunk again and again, having fallen upon the earth, then having got up and again drunk (wine) there is no rebirth.&rsquo; 1758</p>

Nectar is said to flow from such communion. The sādhaka drinks it and becomes supremely happy. This is the wine called Kulāmṛta, which a sādbaka of the spiritual plane drinks&hellip;&hellip; In reference to a sādhaka of the spiritual (adhyātmika ) class the Tantra says &lsquo;Pityā pitvā&hellip;vidyato, During the first stage of Şat-cakra-sādbanā the sādhaka cannot suppress his breath for a sufficiently long time at a stretch to onable him to practise concentration and meditation in each centre of Power. He cannot therefore detain Kundalini within the Subhumna longer than his power of Kumbhaka permita. He must consequently come down upon the earth i.e. the Mūlādhāra, which is the centre of the element earth, after having drunk of the heavenly ambrosia. The sādhaka must practise this again and again and by constant practice, the Cause of rebirth i. e, vāsanā (desire) is removed.&rdquo; This explana. tion sounds very profound and highly psychical, but it is not at all convincing. Similarly, the present author wonders how many writers on Tantras and how many Tāntrikas understood the theory of sublimation put forward in Tantras as a way of realization&rsquo; (Cultural Heritage of India, Vol. IV, pp. 233-235) by way of explaining the insistence on five makāras. The first question is: why was it necessary to employ vulgar language to describe a state of profound bliss ? Supposing the explanation of madya offered by Woodroffe is accepted, what is the explana tion about offering flesh and fish? One cannot easily get out. of matsyası&rsquo; and &lsquo;mārgāśi&rsquo; the esoteric sense required by the apologists. The Kulārṇava, the Pārānanda-sūtra and several</p>

<p>other works almost always employ the words madya, mānga and fish in the ordinary sen86. They rarely, if at all, drop the hint that words like mataya and māmga aro being used in an esoteric senge and proceed to deal with realities of madya and flesh. The Kulārpava quotes (II. 126 ) the verge of Manu IX, 93 (surā vai malam-annānām &amp;o.), provides for the preparation of the three kinds of surā (V. 15-21), and says (V. 30 ) that surā la the 12th kind among intoxicants and that there are eleven other kinds of intoxicants made from jack-fruit, grapes, dates, sugar oane &amp;o. (V. 29). In XI. 22-35 the Kulārnava dilates upon the etiquette to be observed in drinking wine as part of Kaula practice. It proceeds (V. 44 ) to divide flesh into three classes yiz of animals that fly in the sky (birds ), of acquatic animals and of those that move on the earth. The 1759 Svacchandatantra (&amp; work of great authority in Kashmir Saivism) prescribea that various kinds of fish and meat and other food that can be licked and drunk should be poured in front of Siva (image) and one should not stint for money. Quotations from Pārānanda-sutra (notes 1698, 1703-4) make it perfectly clear that the words madya, māmse, and maithuna are employed therein in the ordinary Bense, Pārānandasūtra (on pp. 80-81, paragraphs 69-70 and pp. 82-83 para. 76-80) describes such obscene details of the sādhaka&rsquo;s sexual intercourse that it is not possible to set them down here. The ordinary worship of Dovl was elaborate enough, containing as it did 16 upacaras ( vide p. 164 note 420 above). Where was the necessity of bringing in wine, meat and maithuna as an absolutely necessary part of the worship of Dari? The Kulārnava and other tantras praise the Vedas, employ vedic mantras and quote1760 Upaniṣad and Gitā passages.

In spite of all this lip service to the Veda the tantras ignore the great moral dangers involved in their persistent teaching of five makāras and also pay no hood to the impressive advice of the Gitā (III. 21) that whatever &amp; great or honoured man does or holds as authoritative is followed by all common people. There are several late medieval works about the Kaula oult that speak of drinking wine, eating flesh and maithuna in the vulgar senge as means of Devi worship and yet assert that by doing so mukti (liberation) would be secured. Two verses from a ms of a tantrik work called Kaularahasya (containing one hundred Verses) will bring home to the reader how common people understood the cult of the makāras.1761</p>
<p>Prof. Heinrich Zimmer in the Art of Indian Asia' (vol. I pp. 129-130) observes such living forms are suggested to the Indian artist by a dynamio philosophy that is intrinsic to his religious and philosophical tradition, for the worship of the life force pouring into the universe and maintaining it, mani. festing itself no less in the gross matter of daily experience than in the divine beings of religious vision constitutes the very foundation of Indian religious life. According to this doctrine which was particularly influential in the great periods of Indian art, release from the bondage of our normal human imperfection can be gained not only through the world nogating methods of asceticism (yoga) but equally through a perfect realization of love and its sexual enjoyment (bhoga). According to this view which has been eloquently expressed in the so-called Tantrio symbols and rituals of both the Hindu and Buddhist traditions, there is intrinsically no antagonism between yoga and bhoga. The role played by the guru, the spiritual guide and teacher in the stern masculine disciplines of yoga, is</p>

The initiating women plays the part of Sakti while the male initiate assumes that of Śiva and both attain together to the realisation of the immanence within themselves of the consubstantiality of the Goddess and the God.' It has already been stated (p. 1054 ) that Prof. Zimmer is wrong in thinking that the Tāntrik rites were systematically disparaged as rāmamārga' by the Indian partisans of Yoga. He is also wrong (p. 130 ) when he says that &lsquo;throughout the first millenium A. D. they (Tantric rites ) were a basic element of normal Indian expert. enco.&rsquo; There is really very little evidence to substantiate this claim. He makes this sweeping generalisation as an art-oritio and historian of Indian Art from the few tintrio sculptures on the Puri and other temples in Orissa and some other places in India. Vide the well-known work &ldquo;Bengal Lancer' by F. Yeats-Brown (London, Golancz, 1930) pp. 23:-237, where the superintendent of the temple of Jagannātha justifies the obscene frescoes on the ground that until a man is master of his gross body he cannot see the Godhead and feels sure that future ages will look on Tāntrik psychology with understanding.</p>

<p>A most rovolting rite from the view-point of all unsophisti cated people is what is called &lsquo;oakra-pājā&rsquo; (worship in a circle). An equal number of men and women without distinction of caste and even near blood relations secretly meet at night and sit in a oircle (vide Kaulāvallnirnaya VIII, 76). The Goddess is repre sented by a yantra (diagram). There is a leader of the cakra. The regulations were that only persons who had attained the status of Vira ( defined above in n 1763 ) were to be admitted 1764 and paśus (ordinary men with beastly passions not curbed) were to be excluded. What assurance was there that the leader of the cakra himself possessed the noble qualities mentioned in the vorse quoted above and would choose only men possessed of similar qualities ?

<p>• History of Dhurmutāstra (Soc. VI, Ch. XXVI</p>
<p>Śrioakra must have given rise to great obloquy and unpopu larity for the Tantrikas. Therefore, the Kulārpava 1765 adviser that cakrapūjā should be sub rosa, &lsquo;What happens at Srloakra, wbother good or bad, should never be uttered (in publio); this is the order (of God); one should never give out infor mation about what happens at Cakrapūjā&rsquo;. The 18th century Mahānirvanatantra, which is reformist in character, states that, since in the Kali age (in which people are weak and the influence of sinful age is very strong ), for the last tattva (i. e. maithuna) one&rsquo;s own wife is alone to be the Sakti because in that case no fault can be found or some substitute like red sandalwood paste &lsquo;may be employed. In the author&rsquo;s youth whispers floated about that in some towns in Mahārāstra oakra. pūjā was practised, that even great Pandits thought that their learning was due to the favour of Devi, that they, though very orthodox in other respects, took once a year in Devipūja &amp; thimbleful of wine as prasāda. The learned Achyutaraya 1766 Modak of Nasik composed at Nasik a work called &lsquo;Avaidika dhikkrti&rsquo; (condemnation of non-vaidika practices) wherein he soverely handled the cult of the five makaras.</p>
<p>Naturally common people, who could not appreciate or understand the abstruse and subtle philosophy of Sakti, Nada, Bindu and so forth, seized with avidity upon the apparently basy path of worship of Sakti by the five makāras and the mantras, bijas, cakras and the like taught by the Tantras and it has been seen above (pp. 1073–76 ) to what depths some persons professing to be gurus, Sāktas and Tantrikas descended in course of time.</p>
<p>The path of the Tantras was in its higher level one of Upāsanā or Bhakti, though it very often degenerated into magio and moral depravity. The deity worshipped viz. Paramesvari</p>

<p>Three aspects of Devi</p>
<p>1091</p>
<p>presented three aspects to the upāsaka 1767 ( devotee) viz. gross (sthūla), subtle (sūkṣma) and para (highest). The first aspect is represented by the form of Devi with hands, feet and other limbs, which is fit for worship with the hands and the eyes of the devotee; the second aspect consists of mantras, which are fit for apprehension with the organs of hearing and speech by those who have the good fortune to receive the mantras from &amp; worthy guru. The third aspect (para) is one to be apprehended by the mind of the sādhaka and described as all-poryading consciousness and the like (in Nityaṣodasika VI. 49-50 ).</p>
<p>Some modern writers have beon somewhat unjust to the whole Tantrik literature in labelling it all as black magic or as full of obscenities. The present writer is not one of those who some times hold that what is not understood is either false, absurd or non-existent. He is prepared to believe that the end and aim of a few of the higher minds among Tāntrikas and of some of the works on Tantra was the attainment of high spiritual powers by Yoga practices, the Realization of the Supreme Tattva (Principle) variously designated as Brahma, Viṣnu, śiva or Dovi, and Liberation (mokṣa). He is aware that many of these claim to be based on Vedic traditions, teachings and practices and to have further developed the conceptions underlying Vedic teachings and ritual and that even the magio rites contained in Boveral Tantrik works had their counterparts, though on a much smaller scale, in the Rgveda, the Atharyaveda, Samavidbina Brāhmaṇa and other Vedic works. The present author, though he has carefully studied many of the Tantras and the Yogasutra of Patanjali with the bhāṣya and commentaries thereon, has to admit that he has had no mystic experience, but he is not pre pared to deny that prophets, saints, poets and others might have mystio visions and experiences.

<p>History of Dharmasastra (Sec. VI, Ch. XXVI</p>
<p>and unknown as propounded in Alexis Carrell&rsquo;s work Man the unknown&rsquo; and in &lsquo;Invisible influence&rsquo; by Dr. Alexander Cannon (15th impression, Rider and Co., London, 1935). He knows that some of the Tantrik works made a distinction between the rules of ordinary social life and conventions (samājā-dharma ) and the peculiar forms of Tantrik worship, in which, while it lasts, no diatinction is made on the ground of caste Or Box (vide notes 1711 and 1713). It may further be conceded that the Tantra works placed women on a footing of equality with men, gave them an exalted position and that they endea voured to provide a common platform (as shown in n. 1704 above) for differing and wrangling sects of Vaisnavas, Saivas and others by putting forward Dovi as the object of worship for all; but they had not much success as is shown by the fact that Vaisnavas and Saivas still carried on their quarrels and that the Tāntrik texts themselves fell into five classes, viz. Saiva, Sakta, Vaisnava, Saura and Gāpapatya and that there are differing doctrines among the Tāntrikas called Kādimata, Hādimata &amp;o.</p>
<p>The matters that distinguish Tāntrik works from other religious literature in Sanskrit are the 1768 promise of the attain ment of miraculous powers, the Realization of the one Supreme Principle in &amp; short time by means of the Tāntrik sādhanā &quot; method or procedure (vide Intro. to &lsquo;Principles of Tantra&rsquo; p. XIV), by their insistence on the worship of Devi with makāras alone as yielding the desired results (as in Maha. nirvāṇa V. 24 &lsquo;paīcatattva-vibināyām pūjāyām na phalod</p>
<p>1768, Sir Jobo Woodroffe remarks (in the latrodaction to his . Priaci ples of Tantra&rsquo; part 2, pp. XII-XIV) that the one topic that appears to diferentiate Tantras from other religious works is the constitaent parts of its ritual such as the mantras, bijas, modrās, yantras, bhutasuddhi and that it is mainly by these items rather than by anything else that tho tāatrik character of a work is established. Vide also the Sāktas. by E. A, Payne p. 137 for a similar view. Sir, Jobo Woodroffe, while reviewing Payao&rsquo;s work (in JRAS for 1935 at p. 387), himself agreed that what distinguished the Sākta ritual is the maptra and magical sections and that part of it which deals with the secret ritual, that, while there is ordinarily do thoga (enjoyment) where there is yoga, in the Sākta doctrine a man may hava borb yoga and bhoga and that this is a distiact and profound characteristic of that doctrine. Even the Buddhist Vajrayapa Tantra porport to aim at the attaiament of bodhi (vide Gahyasamāja p. 154, Sadhanamālā I. p. 225 and II. P. 421) and ARE 14 # T: HATGIT:</p>

<p>bhavah&rsquo;) and on their peculiar ritual of mantras, bijas (syllables meaningless to ordinary men), nyāgas, mudrās, cakras, yantras and similar things for attaining their goal. The condemnation poured on Tantricism is principally due to their insistence on wine, meat and sexual unions as the best and the only means for the effective worship of Devi, their theory that by merely repeating some mantra or mantras over wine, meat and other tattvas, by offering them to Devi and by medita tion on her, one may drink wine or eat meat, whon in the same breath they say emphatically that partaking of wine and meat is ainful without this ritual. This antagonizes those who are not kaulas and who hold that this persistent teaching is very dangerous for the common run of mon and savours of hypocrisy,</p>
<p>Some of the Tantras practically inculcated what appears to non-tantrikas unbridled licence. The Kaulāvali-nirnaya (IV. 15 ff) asserts: &ldquo;The Sāktas have no higher means of happi ness and liberation than the fifth tattva (i.e. maithuna ); &amp; sādhaka becomes siddha only by the practice ) of the fifth tattve. If he resorts only to the first (i. e. wine ) he becomes only Bhairava, if only to the 2nd (meat) he becomes Brahmi, by the third (fish) he becomes &amp; mahabhairava, by the 4th (mudra) he becomes foremost among sādhakan.179 The same Tantra goos further and frankly says &lsquo;all women are fit for intercourse to a (Sākta) worshipper except the wives of his guru or of those sāktas who have attained to the status of Vira, that for those who have reached the stage of advaja there is no prohibition por is anything enjoined. To the pure everything is pure, it is only the hankering that is blamable. In this con nection that work advances certain puerile and obscene argu ments (in VIII, 223-225) about illicit or incestuous intercourse that cannot be get out here. That tantra does not stand alone in suob statements. For example, the Kālivilāsatantra (X. 20-21) allows adulterous intercourse to a &lsquo;Sākta devotee pro</p>

<p>vided it is not carried to the last stage of omission and avers that, if he observes the condition in the proviso, he would become the master of supernatural powers in spite of adultery. It should be noted that the author of this work has unabashed hardihood to make Siva tell this to Pārvati. About wine that work remarks just as drinking of soma 1770 ja prescribed for brahmapas is solemn Vedic sacrifices, similarly wine should be drunk at proper times (or according to the practice of Kaulas), since it confers enjoyment as well as mokṣa; drinking wine is blamable in the case of those who hanker after benefits or who are egoistic; but in the case of those that are free from egoista there is neither prohibition (of drinking) nor the enjoining of it. One who is free from the fetters of making distinctiona should practise drinking wine for the purpose of remembering the meaning of the mantras and for making his mind fixed on worship) but he who resorts to wine, and other tattvas merely for pleasure is sinful.&rsquo; The teachings of works like the Kaula. yali-nirnays about drinking wine and sexual intercourse with all sorts of women as the highest means of Sakti worship by persons professing to be advaitins led to great depravity and sexual immorality and orgies as indicated by the criticism in medi eval works cited above (pp. 1073–76) that regarded Tantrik teach Inge as execrable, though some medieval Hindu works admitted into religious practices nyāga, mudrā, yantra and the like, which were deemed to be innocuous and which would be described in this work later on. The mere intention of doing good if certain conditions were fulfilled is not onongh excuse, when it is most likely that the means proposed for attaining &amp; bigh spiritual level and for liberation would have the opposite effect on most people. Taking all things into consideration, the present author is constrained to observe that modieval and recent writers who loverely criticized Tantrik works were on the whole largely justified in their condemnation of Tantrik practices as enunciated in many Tāntrik worka and of the works themselves. For one man that attained super-normal powers, high spiritual level and great mystic experience there must have been hundreds of hypocrites, charlatans, and licentious mon who deluded frustful and ignorant med and particularly women.</p>

<p>Only a few Purāṇas like the Devipurāṇa, the · Kalika, the Devimahatmya in the Markandega provide for the employment of some of the condemned makaras (madya, mārga, matsya) in the worship of the Great Goddess. From about the 6th or 7th century A.D. Puranas began to incorporate the special ceremonial characteristics of the Saktas and Tantrikas. Aparārka quotes a passage 177 from the Devipurāṇa wherein the qualifications of a Sthāpaka (one who performis Dovapratiṣthā) are set out, viz, he would be the best sthāpaka for establishing images of Devi and the Matrs, who knows the vāma (left or opposite ) and the dakṣiṇa (right) path of worship, who has thoroughly mastered the veda relating to the Mātrs (the Mother Goddesses), who is olever in the interpretation of Panoarātra works and is proficient in the Tantras of the Matrs &amp;c. The Kālika-purāṇa devotes many chapters (54 ff) to the desoription of mantras, kavacas, mudrās, nyāsas &amp;c. The Bhagavatapurāṇa also and Agni 1772 372.34 expressly say that the worship of gods and of Vignu also is either vaidiki, tāntriki or mitrā, the first and third being for the three higher varnas and the tantriki for sūdras. The Bhagavatapurāṇa refers to the worship of Keśava laid down in the Tantras for him who desires to cast out the knot (bondage or grief) of the heart, It (Bhagavata) also mentions 1773 Vaidiki and Tantriki dikṣā (in XI. 11. 37) and refers to the Tāntrik method of the angas, upāngas, Āyudhas and decorations in the worship of the Lord of Laksml. 1774 Some of the Purāpas and medieval nibandhas, however, fully utilized what Tantras bad to say about mantras, japa, nyāsa, mandala, cakra, yantra and</p>

<p>Classification of Vedic mantras</p>
<p>1097</p>
<p>of four classes viz. Țk (which is metrical), yajus ( which has no restriction as to metre but which must be a sentence), &amp; saman (which is sung) and nigada (i. o. praiga, meaning words that are addressed by one person to another calling upon the latter to do a certain act, e. g. the words &lsquo;srucaḥ sammrddhi, proksanir āsādaya&rsquo;. Nigadas are yajus in form but are distinguished from yajus by the fact that the former are loudly uttered, while a yajus is ordinarily recited in a low voice.1978 The most sacred mantra is the Gāyatri (Rg. III, 62. 10 &lsquo;tat-savitur&rsquo; &amp;c). The Atharvavada (XIX. 71.1) calls it Vedamātā (the mother of the Veda). The Bľahadāraṇyakopaniṣad (V. 14) contains a grand eulogy of the Gāyatri.1779 Om is a very sacred syllablo, &amp; symbol of brahma and may be called in the language of the Tantras a bija. There are only a few syllables such as om, phat, vaṣat in the Vedic literature that on the face of them have no meaning but are like bija mantras in the Tantra sense. There is a Bijanighaṇķu (a dictionary of bija mantras ) printed in Tantrik texts&rsquo; Vol. I, pp. 28–29 (where monosyllabic bijas such as Hrim, Srim, Krim, Hum, phat, are set out and described in symbolic words indicated in note 1708 above. It is stated about a dozen times in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa viz. it is the perfection of sacrifice when it is rūpasamddha ( perfect as to its form ) i, e. when the fk verse pointedly refers to the sacrificial act that is being performed. 1780 The Nirukta.(I. 15–16) starts a lengthy discussion on Kautsa&rsquo;s view that mantras have no sense (or are purposeless). There is a long discussion in the Pūrvamlmāmgāsūtra (I. 2. 31 ff) on the name lines 88 in the Nirukta. Jaimini states that there is no difference in the meanings of words employed in the Veda and those employed by people and Sabara adds in his bhāṣya (on P. M. S. I. 2. 32) that mantras are recited in sacrifices only for the purpose of conveying or manifesting the meaning.1781 It is difficult to</p>

<p>define what &amp; vedic mantra is and it is generally understood, as said by Sabara, that passages or versos are mantras that are recognised as such by the learned. 1782 The whole Veda is divided into five categories viz. Vidhi (hortatory passages as in &lsquo;Agni hotram jubuyāt&rsquo;), mantras, nūmadheya (names such as Udbhid in &lsquo;Udbhida yajeta&rsquo; or Viśyajit&rsquo; as in &ldquo;Viśvajitā yajeta'), ni ṣedha (prohibition as in &lsquo;nānstam vadet&rsquo;) and artharāda (explanatory or laudatory pagaagos as in &lsquo;Vāyu is a deity that is swiftest&rsquo;). The Nirukta ( 20 ) embodies the ancient view that the søges had an intuitive perception of Dharina and they transmitted the mantras by oral instruction to those that oame after them and that had no intuitive perception of Dharma. The mantras and stolras were supposed oven in the Rg. to induce the gods to come to the sacrifices and to bestow on those who recited them protection, valiant sons, cattle, wealth, victory and all sorts of things (e. g. vide Rg. I. 102. 1-5, II. 24. 15-16, II. 25. 2, III. 31. 14, IX. 20.7, IX. 72.9, X. 78. 8, X. 105. 1). It has beon shown above p. 920 ( in notes 4167-4168 ) how the Purānas prescribed their own mantras for many religious gots but those mantras also are significant and not meaningless.</p>
<p>Mantras are the very heart and core of Tantraśāstra 80 much so that the sastra is often spoken of as mantragāstra. The theory of Tantrik writings such as the Prapancadāra and Sāradātilaka about mantras may be briefly stated as follows: In the human body there are ten nadis, the three principal being Idā (on the left side from the left testicle to the left nostril), Suṣumnā (in the middle of the body in the spinal chord) and Pingalā (on the right side from the right tosticle to the right nostril). The Kundalini lies asleep coiled like a snake in the Mūlādbāra-cakra. It is a form of the sabda-brahma. The Day! (or Sakti) assumes the form of Kundalini, all gods reside in Devi and all mantras are Her forms ( Śāradātilaka I. 55-57). It has already been stated how from contact with light (Jyotib ) Sakti becomes conscious and has a desire to create, then it . solidifies and appears as a bindu. Through the instrumentality</p>

<p>of Kala (Time) bindu divides itself into three, gross (i. e. bija ), subtle (sukemale. nada which is bijabindu) and para (i.s. bindu which is karyabindu). This last is of the nature of an unmanifest sound and is called sabdabrahma 17824 by the sagos (Saradatilaka I. 11-12. Prapeficasara I. 41 ff). Sabdabrahma exists in all things as consciousness; it exists in the bodies of living human beings in the form of Kundalini and then appears as letters in prose, poetry and so forth, being carried by Vayu (air) to the throat, palate, teeth &amp;c. The sounds thus produced . are called akṣaras and when written they are spoken of as varnas (letters of the alphabet, matrka, which are 50 from a to ksa). The impulse to sound production arising in muladhara-cakra is called &lsquo;para.&rsquo; (vak), it is called paśyanti when it reaches avādhiṣthāna-cakra, nadhyamā in the heart and vaikhari in the mouth. Both aksara and varṇa are Kundalini made articulate in speech and visible in writing. All the mantras (some say they are nine crores) are evolved from the varṇas of the alphabet that are deemed (by Tantrikas) to be living conscious sound powers. It is the bija mantras like hrim, śrim, krim that make visible the form of the Devata (Mahanirvana v. 18-19),1783 It is wrong to suppose that mantras are mere letters or words or language. They assume different forms, such as bija-mantras, kavaca, hrdaya &amp;c. The bijamantras like Hrim (representing Tribhuvanośvari or Maya), Srim (representing Laksmi), Krim (representing Kali) cannot possibly be called language, since they convey no mean ing to ordinary men.

<p>History of Dharmasastra (Soc. VI, Ch. XXVI</p>
<p>sādhaka, the worshipper) imparted to the sādhaka by the qualified guru at the time of dikai (initiation). They are not efficacious if merely learnt by reading books. Amantra accord ing to Tantrik works is the sound body of Sakti charged with the vibrations of the spiritual personality of the original Tantrika soor of the mantra and endowed with a perpetual store of power by the Tantrik seer. What is needed to awaken Power in the disciple and to reap the full effect of the mantra is the touch of the guru, the imagination and concentrated will power of the sādhaka. The deity willed that certain letters uttered by the seer should as aound or sounds convey such and such a meaning and should have a certain potency. The sounds represented by the letters are forms of Sivasakti i.e. $abdabrahma. From this last the whole world proceeds in the form of sounds (sabda ) and the objects (artha) which sounds or words denote. The Devatā, the mantra and the guru are the essentials of sūdhanā (procedure that leads on to Siddhi, laid down in Tantrik works); the disciple bas to revolve in his mind that the three are non-different. Mantra is not the same thing as a prayer. For a prayer &amp; person may employ any words that he may choose, but in the case of a mantra definite letters are considered necessary, which are deemed to be the forms in which Sakti manifests Herself to the worshipper. A mantra may be in the form of words that have an obvious meaning or in the form of latters arranged in a particular order and that have no meaning to the uninitiated. It is recognised in some of the works on this sāstra that thought has creative power, that each person is Siva, and can attain to higher and higher spiritual levels depending upon his ability to realise himself as Śiva. Thoughts are real, kind thoughts will do good to ourselves and to those around us, evil thoughts and wishes of others may cause us suffering.</p>
<p>Tāptrik works have their own inantras and they also employ Vodic mantras. For example, the mantra Jātavedase sunavāma&rsquo; ( Rg. I, 99. 1), though addressed to Agai, is employed in later works for invoking Durgā, the mantra &lsquo;Tryambakam yajāmahe&rsquo; (Rg. VII, 59, 12 ) is addressed to Rudra, but is called Mṛtyañjaya-mantra or mrtasanjivini mantra in Tantrik works and is prescribed for purifying the mind (cittasuddhi) in the Mahānirvana (VIII, 243). Similarly, the Gāyatri mantra (Rg. III. 62. 10) is employed by the Tantrikas. Vide Sāradātilaka XXI. 1-8</p>

<p>derates the whole ohapter 30 to the explanation of om, the vyāhrtis and the words of the Gayatri and Gayatri-sadhana). The Mahānirvana prescribes the performance of Vaidiki sandhyā to be followed by the Tantriki sandhyā. The Tantriki Gāyatri is * Ādyāyal vidmahe Parameśvaryai dhimahi i tan-naḥ Kāli praco dayāti (Mahānirvāṇa V. 62-63). Even Śūdra Tantrikas were to recite this last, while the three higher classes were to repeat the vedic Gāyatri employing om, śrim and aim before it respec tively. The importance of guru, mantra and dovatā is emphati cally brought out in the following verse &lsquo;the person, who considers guru as a mere mortal, a mantra ag mere letters and images (of deities ) as mere stones falls into Hell.&lsquo;1784 The Rudrayāmala says &lsquo;If Siva is angered, Guru can save ( the pupil), but if Guru is angered, no one can save (the pupil)&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The Parasurāmakalpasūtra, Jõānārṇavatantra, the Sāradās tilaka and almost all Tantrika works say that mantras possess wonderful and inconceivable powers, 1785 that a follower of Tantra secures all powers by following the practices of the school of his guru traditionally handed down and by faith, that mantras are the means of securing the fruits desired, that the authoritativeness of Tantraśāstra depends mainly on the faith of the followers of the sāstra; that the sādhaka should come to feel that guru, mantra, the deity, his own soul, mind and life breaths are all one and then he will possess the knowledge of the Highest Self. Some ot the Tantrik works contain most exag gerated praises of mantras, particularly the śrividyāmantra of sixteen letters; 0. g. Jñānārpaya says &lsquo;Even crores of Vajapoyas and thousands of Aśvamedhas are not equal ( in merit) to even the utterance of Srividyā and so also gifts of crores of Kapila COws cannot be compared to one utterance of frividyā (24th</p>

<p>Numberless mantras are contained in the Tantras made from different arrangements of the constituent parts of a mantra. The Mahānirvāpa first gives &amp; mantra of ton syllables as noted below and then by different arrangements of the letters and by addition of certain other syllables and words like &ldquo;Kalike&rsquo; it forms twelve mantras, remarks that there are croros of mantras and that the mantras contained in all Tantras are all mantras of the Great 1785 Devi.</p>
<p>The word mantra is explained as derived from &lsquo;man&rsquo; to think and &lsquo;trai&rsquo; or &lsquo;tra&rsquo;. Yaska&rsquo;s Nirukta (VII. 12) derives it simply from &lsquo;man&rsquo;. The Kularpava says &lsquo;mantra&rsquo; is so called since it saves from all dangers, as the rādhaka thereby is led to ponder over God of immeasurable refulgence that is the only principle (in the world ). A similar derivation is given by Ramapūrva tapaniya Upanisad, by the Prapalicasara and other Tantras.1787 Numerous varieties of mantras called Kavaca, Hṣdaya, Upabr daya, Netra, Astra, Raksa and so forth are specified in the Tāatrik texts, one or two of which may be illustrated in the note below and the rest are passed over for reasons of space.1788 ____1786.

<p>Classification of mantras into male &amp;c.</p>
<p>1103</p>
<p>The Sāradatilaka divides mantras into male, female and Deuter; masculine mantras end in &lsquo;hum&rsquo; and &lsquo;phat&rsquo;, female mantras in &lsquo;svāhā&rsquo; and neuter mantras end with &lsquo;namaḥ&rsquo;, This is stretched further so as to apply to letters viz. the vowels FF, ! I are said to be neither and the rest are said to be not neuter but only short and long (Śāradātilaka, VI. 3 and Rāghavabhatta thereon). Sāradātilaka (from chap. VII to XXII) is devoted to mantras of Sarasvati, Lakṣmi, Bhuva neśvari, Tvaritā and others, Durgā, 1789 Tripurā, Ganapati, Candran mas. Many of the mantras are to be repeated thousands of times or lakhs of times in order to secure full effect. For example, in X. 105-107 the Sāradātilaka prescribes that a certain mantra should be repeated five lakhs of times and then fifty thousand āhutis of ghee should be made and worship of the Devi with the procedure prescribed should be performed. The worshipper then BOCUNOS whatever he may desire and can make kings sub-servient to his will. Another noticeable feature is that the mantras are treated like the mantras of the Veda and mention is made in the manner of the Anukramanis of the eage, the metre, the deity and the viniyoga (or purpose for which it is to be used or employed). Though the Sāra dātilaka is a sober work free from the sexual practices of Vāmamārga, still it does contain mantras for magical purposes such as bringing women under control (IX. 103-104, X, 76), 1790 bringing about the paralysing or the death of an enemy by mantras ( XI. 60-124, XXI. 95 XXII, 1 ff).</p>

For example, it says that a certain mantra that is a prince among mantras conforg Buddhahood, what need is there to say about othere siddhis, that by another mantra even Buddhahood which is extremely difficult to attain is like a jujube fruit placed on the palm of the band and that a certain mantra ( of unmeaning worde) if repeated five times at three periods in the day viz. the morning, noon and evening, makes even a fool (lit. an ass) master of three handred works.

It is impos sible to deal with this work in this note, He states that the Mantra &ldquo;Om&rsquo; &amp;c. is dedicated to Avalokitesvara (a fine pbotographic plate of whom occurs as the Frontispiece). None who is not a confirmed Tibetan Buddhist scholar or mook will accept bis interpretations of the words of the mantra, On P. 27 be states that the mantra is pronounced in Tibet as &lsquo;Om Mani Peme Hūm&rsquo; and that the complete formula is &lsquo;Om&hellip; Hūm, Hrih&rsquo; (p. 230); on pp. 84 f, he scouts the idea that tāntrism is a Hinduistic reaction taken over by later Buddhist schools. He offers different esoteric meanlags of the words of the mantra, e. g. op p. 130 he says &lsquo;om is the ascent towards universality, Hūm is the descent of the states of aniversality into the depth of the buman beart&rsquo;: on p. 131 &lsquo;Om is the infinite, but Hum is the sofinite in the finite, the eternal in the temporal&rsquo; &amp;c.; on p. 230 &lsquo;In the Om, we experi epce tbe Dharmakāya and the mystery of tbe upiversal body, in mani&rsquo; the Sambhogakāya, in the Padma we experience the Nirmāṇakaya, ia the Hum we experience the Vajrakaya as synthesis of the transcendental body of tbe three mysteries; io the Hrih, we dedicate the totality of our transformed personality to the service of Amitabba; on p. 256 &lsquo;thus Om..

<p>Buddhist Mahāyāna mantras</p>

<p>p. 336 and No. 108. p. 221). Some of the mantras embody the doctrines of Mahāyāna with the addition of syllables like om, phat, svāha (such as &lsquo;om sūnyatā-jāānavajrasvabhava tmakoham&rsquo; in Sadhanamālā vol. I. p. 62). The Prapanoasāra, which is ascribed to the great advaita teacher Saṅkarācārya and on which Padmapāda is said to have written a commentary (both published by A. Avalon in Tāntrik Texts, vol. XVIII-XIX, 1935), contains a mantra called Trailokya-mohana for the purpose 1793 of the six cruel magic rites and (in 34.33) describes &amp; yantra (diagram ) by worship of which a sādhaka can make a woman smitten with passion for him and draw her to him, This, among other matters such as ungrammatical forms, raises grave doubts as to whether the work was really composed by the first Saṅkarācārya. It may, however, be stated that the learned Rāghavabhatta in many places in his commentary on the Sāradātilaka (such as I, 7, 8, 12) quotes the Prapancasāra ( I. 42, 44 ) as the great ācārya&rsquo;s work and several later writers do the same. It has to be borne in mind, however, that about 400 works are ascribed to the great advaita Acārya and that Rāghavabhatta was separated by at least seven centuries from the great Ācārya and his ascription therefore cannot be accepted with implicit faith without more evidence,</p>
<p>Several Purāṇas are affected by the theory about the power of mantras of the Tantrika type. The Garuda-purāṇa (I. chap. 7 and 10) employs many monosyllabic unmeaning mantras like hrām, kṣaum, brim, hum, kuh, śrim, hrim and says (I, 23 ) that</p>
<p>om Khakholkāya Sūryamurtayo namah&rsquo; is the mūlamantra of the Sun and this mantra is employed for sun-worship in an early digest like the Kṛtyakalpataru od vrata (p. 9 note). The Bhavisya-purana (Brāhmaparva 215. 4) gives &lsquo;Khakholkāya namah&rsquo; as the mūlamantra in Sun worship. The Bhavisya (Brāhma. 29. 9-15 ) provides that &lsquo;gam svāhā&rsquo; is &lsquo;the mūla mantra of Ganapati worship, oites the mantras for hṣdaya, sikhā, kavaca &amp;o. and a Gāyatri suited to Ganapati, 1794 Garuda I. 38 contains a long prose mantra of Cāmupdā.

<p>of a mantra for paralysing ( stambhand) of an enemy. Chap. 133–135 of the Agni contain several mantras of the Tantrik type. Chapter 307 contains several mantras of bringing under control the three worlds.</p>
<p>A mantra called Mahāśvetā is spoken of in the Bhavisya purāṇa which is nientioned in the Krtyakalpataru on vrata (p. 9) and in Ekādaśitattva p. 40 and it is&rsquo; brām hrim sah&rsquo; and the japa of that mantra on Sunday with fast is said to yield what one desires. 1736</p>
<p>The later medieval digests on Dharmaśāstra. adopt the Prānapratistha mantra erolved by the Sāradātilaka (XXIII, 71– 76). The Dorapratisthā tattva 1797 (pp. 506-507) quotes there verses from Saradātilaka, sets out the mantra and explains the versos at length. The Divyatattva also (pp. 609-610) does the same. The Vyavahāramayūkha (p. 86 ) sets out the same mantra for the consecration of the image of Dharma in the ordeal of Dharma without expressly naming the Sāradātilaka. The Nirnayasindhu (pp. 349-350 ) has an elaborate rite of the Prānapratisthā of images full of Tantrik elements like the words vaṣat, brim, and phat and employs the same procedure as the one prescribed by the Sāradātilaka without expressly mentioning the latter. The Sāradātilaka appears to follow earlier works like the Jayākhyasamhitā (Patala XX) and Prapaioasāra tantra ( 35. 1-9 ff).</p>

<p>• Contrast between Vedic and Tāntrik mantras 10%</p>
<p>Reasons of space preolude further illustrations of the use of Tantrik mantras by medieval digests on Dharmasastra. One matter of contrast between Vedic mantras and some Tantrik mantras may be noticed. A Vedic mantra, according to Jaimini (I %. 32), was significant, but the Tantras go so far as to teach the repetition of mantras that have no meaning or that oontain the letters of the mantra in reversed form. For example, the Kālivilāsatantra (XXII. 21 ) says that the reverse of the three letters of the mantra &lsquo;om Durge&rsquo;, as &lsquo;rgedu om&rsquo; yields all desires (&lsquo;rgedu om tryakṣaram mantram Sarvakāmaphala- *. pradan)&rsquo;. The Sad-dharmapundarika 1798 (a standard work of Mahāyāna Buddhism ) chap. 21 (text edited by Kern and Bunyiu Nanjiu, 1912 and translated in 8. B. E. vol. XXI. pp. 370-375) contains spells (called Dhāranipadāni). It should not be supposed that spells were peculiar to Hindus or Buddhists. Many ancient peoples believed that words and letters have magic power and that belief led on to another belief that it did not matter even if the letters and words had no sense. E. J. Thomas in ‘History of Buddhist thought&rsquo; (reprint of 1953 ) states that spells similar to Hindu and Buddhist types exist in old English, Old High German and Keltic ( p. 186 ).</p>
<p>The repetition of mantras, Vedic as well as Tantrik, is called &lsquo;Purascaraña ' 1799 (which literally means &lsquo;performing or carrying out before&rsquo;). The Mehāniryāṇa (VII. 76-85 ) sets out Various modes of purasoarapa ( brief as well as elaborate). One way is to bring together five tattvas on the 14th tithi of a dark fortnight or on a Tuesday or Saturday, then the Devi is to be wor shipped and the worshipper is to repeat ten thousand timeg with single-mindedness the mantra in mahānisā (midnight), then he is to feed persons devoted to brahman and becomes one who has carried out purascaraña. Another way is that he should repeat every day one thousand times the mantra beginning on &amp; Tuesday up to (including ) the next Tuesday, so that by repeating the mantra in al eight thousand times on eight days,</p>

<p>he will be deemed to have performed purasoarana. Sometimes.&rdquo; it is prescribed 1800 that a mantra such as &lsquo;Sivaya namah: (this is five-lettered mantra) or &lsquo;Om Sivaya namah&rsquo; (a sadaksera mantra) should be repeated 24 lakhs of times and the sadhaka should offer into Agni twenty-four thousand ūlitis of pāyasas - Then the mantra becomes perfect and confers on the sadhaka whatever be desires. The Kulārpava states that Purasoarapa is so called because by the five-fold upīsınū the deity desired (as if) moves 1801 before the worshipper for conferring on him her favour. A mantra like the Gāyatri ig 1802 to be repeated every day 1008 or 108 or 10 times. This requirement is n: &lsquo;. kooping with what the Purāṇas and Dharmaśāstra works say. For example, the Naradapurana (II. 57.54) provides thata mantra is to be repeated 8,28, or 108 times. The Ekadasitattva180m quotes Devipurāṇa for the proposition that the offerings in the home to planets should be 108. 28 or 8 according to one&rsquo;s ability.</p>
<p>Raghavabhatta in his commentary on Saradatilaka (16.56) has a very exhaustive and learned note on the details of purascarapa that are common to all mantras. According to the Vayaviya-samhita 1833 the perfecting of the procedure of the mūlamantra is called purascarana, since it has to be practised before the acts in which it is to be employed. The Kulārpava 1894 provides that there are at least five constituent elements of purascaraṇa viz. pājā (worship of the desired deity) three times a day, japa (muttering of the mantra), tarpana, homa, and</p>

Rāghavabhatta suggests another way of purascaraṇa viz, one should be pure, 1895 observe a fast and then in an eclipse of the sun or moon should stand in the navel-deep water of a river directly falling into the sea, should recite a mantra with concentration of mind from the time the eclipse begins till its end, thereafter perform homa and the rest in order reducing each to 1/10 of the number of jape recitation, then secure the guru&rsquo;s contentinent (by gifts) and that by this method mantra becomes perfect and the deity becomes favourable. The Kaulāvalinirpaya describes ( 14th patala, verses 75-260) a terrible sādhapā whereby in a single night a sādhaka socures mantra-siddhi yiz, by going to a cemetery or other lonely spot after one watch of the night, securing the corpse of a cāṇdāla, or of one who is killed by some one with a sword or one bitten by a snake or a young handsome warrior dying in a battle (not killed by himself), he should wash the corpse, offer worship to it and to Durgā and repeat the mantra (&lsquo;om Durge Durge rakṣani svāhā&rsquo;).

Rāghavabhatta quotes a verse saying that just as a man in the grip of diseases is incapable of performing all actions a mantra devoid of purascaraṇa is declared to be in a similar condition.</p>
<p>The Agnipurāna, Kulārpava and Sāradatilaka lay down rules about the places where purascarana of mantra is to be practised. The following places are commended 1807 for those who are engaged in porfecting a mantra, viz. holy places, river bank, caves, mountain top, ground near a tirtha, confluence of rivers, holy forests and parks, the root of a llva tree, mountain slopes, temple, seashore, one&rsquo;s own house or any place where the mind ( of the sādhaka ) feels happy. Rules were also laid down as to the food on which the sādhaka was to subsist during the days of purascarana viz. food 160% obtained by begging for alms (for brahmacūrin and yali), havisya food ( prescribed for yratas ), allowed vegetables, fruits, milk, bulbous roots, barley meal. The Mantramahodadhi ( 25. 66-71 ) sets out what is havisya food in śānti and proper food in the other cruel rites. Raghavabhatta (on 16.56 ) adds many rules from other sources, such as the sādhaka performing purascarapa should avoid sexual intercounte, flesh, wine, should not speak with women and sūdras, nor speak untruth, nor pamper his sengos, should carry on the japa from morning till noon, should not allow a break, should repeat the mantra the same number of times every day.</p>

<p>The Jayakhya-gamhita (19th patala, verses 13-33 ) says that, for three years after the sādhaka begins purascarada of the mantra chosen, various obstacles and disturbances present them selves but if his mind and action are not affected by them, then from the 4th year he comes to be served by disciples that gurrender everything to him, that after seven years even proud kings approach him for favour, after the 9th year he notices many wondrous things such as joy, sound dreams, sweet music and fragrance, 1809 hears loud vedic recitation, he eats and sleeps little (yet does not become loan), that these are signs of his having reached perfection in the mantra. The game work provides that such signs he should not divulge to any one but his own guru and if he divulges those happy signs to others siddhis run away from him ( 19. 34-37). The game Samhita (15. 186–188) provides that the syllables svābā, svādhā, phat, hum and namah are to be respectively employed in homa, in rites for manes, destructive activities, creating hatred among friends and for securing mokslo All tantrik works emphasize that mantra must be received from a qualified guru and the sādhanā of the mantra must be done under the guidance of the guru till the disciple himself becomes a siddha. As shown above it was believed that mantras would confer the highest spiritual and supernormal powers, would bring to the sādhaka all desired objects and mokṣa. The Kulārṇave states 1810 &lsquo;It it deolared in the dootrine taught by Śiva that without dikṣā there would be no mokṣa, that diksa cannot be had without an ācārya ( guru) and that mantras would yield no fruit unless a guru instructs (a disciple ) about them&rsquo;.</p>

<p>It was further provided 1811 that there was no siddhi (miraculous powers due to mantras ) nor mokṣa for him who had not had diksa performed for him, that therefore a man should by all means receive dikṣā from &amp; guru and that when one is endowed with the ceremony of dikṣā the distinctions based on caste vanish and a śūdra and a brābmana cease to be so ( when both have undergone dikṣā). It was held that, if a person were to engage in the japa of a mantra written in a book, he would not secure siddhi and he would surely meet losses at every 1812 step.</p>
<p>In the Mabānirvana ( IL 14-15 and 20 ) it is said that Vedic mantras yielded desired results in Satya and other yugas, but in Kaliyuga they are like serpents without poison or like dead ones, that in the Kaliyuga the mantras declared in tantra works yield fruits quickly and are commended for employment in all actions such as japa and sacrifices. There is no such path as the one propounded in Tantras that would lead to nioksa or to happiness in this world and the next. The Mahānirvana prescribes that * om sac-cid-ekam brahma&rsquo; is the best of mantras (III. 14), that those who perform the upisanā of the highest brahma are in need of no other sādhani and that by the mere perfection of that mantra the individual soul merges in brahma, 1813 80 Mokṣa was one of the aims. Another aim was the attainment of miraculous or supernormal powers. The Prapa casāra enume rates 1814 the eight siddhis and states that one who is endowed with these eight is a liberated soul and is apoken of as a yogin, The theory of siddhis is an ancient conception and occurs in the Apastamba-dharmasūtra. 1815 The eight siddhis are named and</p>

<p>explained in the Yogasūtrabhāsya as follows 1816: Animan ( becoming small like an atom, atomization), laghiman (levi tation), mahiman (becoming magnified like a mountain or the sky, magnification), prāpti (all objects becoming near to him such as touching the moon with one&rsquo;s fingertip, extension ), prākāmya (the non-obstruction of his desire such as diving into the earth underground and coming up as if he were in water), vaśitva (mastory of the five elements and their products such as a jar), iśitva (sovereignty over the prodaotion, absorption or arrangement of elements and their products ), yatra-kāmāyasi yitva (the power to determine things according to his wish or will i. e. be may will that poison should have the effect of nectar and brings about that result). A siddha would be one who has secured these eight siddhis. The Gita (X. 26 ) says that the sage Kapila is the great one among siddhas (&lsquo;siddhānām kapilo muniḥ&rsquo;). The Yogagātra further speaks of siddhis as fivefold viz. proceeding from birth, from drugs, from mantras, from tapas (austerities) and from concentration. There were other objects also sought to be achieved by mantras, such as the six cruel rites and making women to have passion for a man. This shows that not only Tāntrikas, but those who practised yoga believed in the power of mantras to confor supernormal powers on the yogin. The Yogasutra provides that some of the siddhis (as in II, 37 ) are obstacles to the attainment of samadhi and they are siddhis only to those who have awakened from trance, 1817 Yāj (III. 202-203) provides that the power to disappear, to enter another body and temporarily to abandon one&rsquo;s body, to create at one&rsquo;s will objects-these and other powers are characteristic signs of the attainment of siddhia by Yoga and that when one attains perfection in Yoga one can cast away the mortal coil and be able to become immortal in brahma</p>

These are all passed over here, But it appears that even the early Purānas were influenced by rites of black magio. For example, the Matsya 1818 says * in vidveṣana (creating enmity among friends or among those who love one another) and in abhicāra, a triangular kunda is recommended and homa should be offered in it by priests that weer red flowers and red sandalwood paste, that wear the sacred thread in the nivita way, that put on red turbans and red garments, the fuel sticks should be smeared with the fresh blood of crows collected in three vessels and should be offered with the left hand holding the bones of a bawk. The priests should have their hair untied on the head and should contemplate the befalling of evil on the enemy; they should recite the mantra durmitri yās-tasmai gantu&rsquo; and also the syllables &lsquo;hrim&rsquo; and &lsquo;phāt&rsquo; and having recited over a razor the mantra used in syenayāga, the priest should cut into pieces an effigy of the enemy with that razor and throw into the fire the pieces of the effigy. This rite yields results only hore (in this world ), but no good results in the next world and therefore one ( who engages in this rite ) should then perform a śānti. The Matsya also provides for &amp; rite for bringing a person (or a woman) under control or for uccātana ( chap. 93. 139–148). It is possible that the Tantrikas and the Matsya both developed their magic rites of six kinds from the Syenayāga mentioned in the Brāhmaṇas and Srauter sitras. The Agnipurāṇa (chap. 138 ) also deals with those evil rites. The Ahirbudhnya-samhita, though mainly a work of the Pāācarātra cult, is full of lore on mantras 1819 In chap.52 (verses</p>

<p>It may be noted here that the Buddhist Tantras also claimed to show the way to the attainment of various objects, from success in love affairs to liberation and all these could be mostly secured by mantras. The Buddhist Tantra writers of the Vajrayāna school state that there were 84 siddhas, whose names are still cherished 1820 and honoured in Nepal and Tibet. : The Buddhists mentioned eight siddhis but they were somewhat different from those of the Yogasūtra. The Sadhanamala mentions them as follows: Khadga (a sword over which mantras have been muttered whereby the user of it succeeds in battle ). Añjana (collyrium applied to syos which enables a person to Bee buried treasure), Pādalepa (ointment applied to the soles of the feet enabling a person to move &lsquo;anywhere undis covered ), Antardhāna ( becoming invisible before the very eyes, of persons watching him ), Rasarasāyana (power of transo. mitting baser metals into gold or finding out an elixir for</p>
<p>immortality), Khecara (being able to fly up in the sky), Bhūcara ( going swiftly anywhere on the earth ) and Pātālasiddhi (diving underneath the earth 1821). As the Buddhist monks were to possess no property, they had a craving for wealth and supposed that by means of certain mantras, the lord of wealth (Kubera) would confer on them riches that would last for over, 1822 They also believed that by mantras they would make</p>

<p>some of the Hindu gods their servants, viz. that they would be surrounded by many apsarases (heavenly damsels), that Indra would be their umbrella-bearer, Brahmā would be councillor and Hari door-keeper. 1823 They wanted to defeat opponents in public discussions and to acquire proficiency in Sāstras without study through the power of mantras alono (vide Sadhanamala Nos. 151, 155, 256 ). They were also anxious to cure and avert diseases and remove snake poison. They thought that by mantras they would attain to omniscience and Buddhahood (vide notes 1791-92 ).</p>
<p>As stated above ( notes 1810-11) a mantra had to be received from a guru after initiation ( diksā ). Therefore, a fow words must be said about dikṣā. The Tantrikas did not discover any new concept in dikṣa. From very ancient Vedic times there Was upadayana regarded as the beginning of the spiritual birth of a boy and the sacrifices had to undergo a purifioatory ceremony before embarking on the performance of a sacrifice, but both were not so elaborate as the dikṣā described in some of the Tantrika works. Vide H. of Dh. vol. II pp. 1135-1140 for Vedic dikṣā (in Agnistoma ), the observanoes and references to the Brahmanas and the Srautasūtrag, The Tai. S. (VI. 1. 1-3 and VII. 4. 8) refers to diksā and the Ait. Br. (1 3) montions the main items in Vedic dikṣā, such as bath with sacred water on the sacrificer, smearing the face and other parts of the body with butter, applying collyrium to the eyes, purification of the sacrificer&rsquo;s body twice by the adhtaryu with three bunches of soven darbhas each above the navel and then below it with mantras, entering a pavilion specially prepared for the sacrificer, covering him with a garment that envelopes him as a sack envelopes an embryo, dark antelope skin as an upper garment, The Sat. Br. also refers to the details of dikṣā and states that thereby the sacrificer becomes one among the gods for the time being ( vide III. 1. 2. 10-21, III, 1, 3. 7-28) and for the idea that diksā symbolizes &amp; now birth for the sacrificor. The Atharva veda says &lsquo;Great truth, formidable moral order, vows of initiation, austerities, prayer (or knowledge) and sacrifice support the earth, ' 1824</p>

<p>Dikst is treated elaborately in some of the Tantras such as Prapancasāra ( V and VI), Kulārnava (14, 39 ff), Sāradātilaka ( 4th patala ), Nityotsava ( pp. 4-10), Jñānārpava ( 24th patala ), Visṇusambitā (X), Mahānirvāṇa (X. 112-119) and in Lingapurāṇa (II. 21). The Nirnaysāgara Press brought out an edition ( in 1935 ) of a work called Dikṣaprakāśikā of Viṣnu bhatta, pupil of Satyānandanātha, composed in saka 1719 ( 1797 A. D.). Almost all of them derive 1825 the word from the root. da&rsquo; (to give ) and &lsquo;kṣi&rsquo; to destroy, in various ways. The Kulārṇava defines it as &lsquo;the good call it dikṣā because it confers a divine (holy ) state and wipes off all sins, thereby freeing a man from the bondage of samsāra &lsquo;; the Sāradātilaka states</p>

<p>The Saktisangama-tantra regards an eclipse of the sun or the moon ( particularly of the moon) as the best time for under going initiation for a mantra from &amp; guru and remarks that when performed in an eclipse, the week day, tithi, nakṣatra or month or Yoga or Karana need not be considered. 1826 The Kālīvilāsatantra states that if one is fortunate enough to secure Svāti naksatra and Friday on the 5th tithi of the dark half of Phālguna and undergoes dikṣā on that date, that yields the rewards of a crore of ordinary dikṣās (VI. 3-4). The N. S. (p. 67 ) quotes the Jūānirnava to the effect that the dikṣā as to a mantra should be on the day of &amp; solar or lunar eclipse or within seven days from an eclipse and adds that the principal time is solar eclipse and quotes Kālottara to the effect that, if the time of a solar eclipse is secured for dikṣā, ope need not consider the month, tithi, the week day and the like. N. 8. also quotes a passage from Yoginitantra condemning dikṣā on a lunar eclipse. Vide Muhūrtakalpadruma of Vitthala p. 94 verse 6 (Nirn. ed.) for further details about times and places for diksā:</p>

<p>History of Dharmalāstra (Soc. VI, Oh. XXVI</p>
<p>The Agnipurāpa ( chapters 27, 81-89 and 304) deals with dikṣā at great length and is full of Tāntrik mantras and rites, but reasons of space forbid any treatment of the same here. The Jõānārpava (24. 45–53) provides that at the time of initiation (dikṣā ) the guru has to instruct the disciple or novice as regards the six cakras ( Ādbāra up to Ajñā) together with the number of petals in each, the colour of each, the letters of the alphabet assigned to each,</p>
<p>Late Dharmaśāstra works relied for the initiation into mantras on tantra works. For example, the Dharmasindhu (p. 32 ) expressly says so. There is a difference between Diksā and upadeśa, which latter means the communication of only a mantra in a solar or lunar eclipse, at a tirtha, Siddhaksetra ( sacred region once inhabited by a siddha) or in a Siva templo. Raghupandana in Diksātattva (vol II. pp. 645-659) gives &amp; lengthy treatment of dikṣā at the beginning of which he remarka that in the Sāradātilaka and other works numerous topics of dikṣā are described but as in his time all those were not being followed he attempts only a brief treatment.</p>
<p>The Mabānirvāpa states (X. 201-202 ) that the guru for giving diksā when the disciple is a Sākta, Saiva, Vaispava, Saura or a Gāṇapatya, should be of the same sect, but a kaula is a good guru for every one. The Mabā nirvāṇa (X. 112) provides that a person does not become a Kaula by merely drinking wine, but he becomes so only after abhiseka. Then (in verses 113-193 of 10th ullāsa ) the Mahānirvāṇa provides an elaborate procedure of complete abhiseka somewhat resembling Christian Baptism. There is first on the day previous to the day of abhiṣoka worship of Ganesa, then of eight Saktis (Brahmi &amp;c.), lokapālas and their weapons. Then the next day (i.e. the day of abhiseka ) after a bath the neophyte donates sesame and gold for the removal of all sins and approaches a guru with the prayer to perform abhiṣoka. Then the guru drawe &amp; sarvatobhadra mandala on an altar, sanctifies the five tattvas, places an auspicious jar and fills it with wine or with holy water. The principal part consists in the guru&rsquo;s sprinkling with water the disciple to the accompaniment of 21 mantras (X. 160-180) invoking 1827 the gods Brahmā, Viṣnu, Siva, the Matre, various Śaktis, the avatārag, the numerous forms of Devi, the dikpalas,</p>

Then the guru gives the disciple a new name ending in Anandanātha, who honours the guru and other Kaulas present. This ceremony may go on for 9,7,5, 3 nights or one night. Vide Tantrarājatantra II. 58-7%, Jñana siddhi (XVII) for similar procedure of abhiseka. Vide the Introduction to the Sekoddesatikā, a Buddhist Tantrik work (in G.O.S.) edited by Mario E. Carelli, for its resemblance to the Christian rite of Baptism. The Ahirhudhnya-samhita (chap. 39) provides a procedure of Mahābhiṣeka as one comedy against all diseases, as one destroying all enemies and for the attainment of all desired objects.</p>
<p>There were four kinds of dikṣas, Kriyavati, Varnamayi, Kalavatı and Vedhamayi and there were elaborate rules about vastuyāga, construction of mandapa, kuṇdas and sthandila, which are all passed over for reasons of space.</p>
<p>CHAPTER XXVII Nyāsas, Mudrās, Yantra, Cakra, Mandala, etc.</p>
<p>One of the important items in the Tantrik ritual and worship is nyūza, which means mentally invoking a god or gods, mantras and holy texts to come to occupy certain parts of the body in order to render the body a pure and fit receptacle for worship and meditation&rsquo;. Soveral works such as the Jayākhya-samhitā (Patala XI), Prapancasāra (VI), Kulārṇava (IV. 18 ff) refer to several kinds of nyāga; the Saradātilaka (IV. 29-41, V. 5-7), Mahānirvāpatantra (III, 41-43, V. 113-118) describe several varieties of ayāsa. Rāghavabhatta on Śārada tilaka (IV. 29-41) cites numerous quotations on nyāsa from an extensive literature. There are several kinds of pyāsa such 1828 as Hamsanyāsa, Prapavanyāsa, Mātṛkanyisa, Mantranyāsa, Karagyāsa, Anganyāsa, Pithanyāsa. Pranavanyaga is illustrated as &lsquo;om ām Brahmane namah&rsquo;, &lsquo;om ām Viṣnavo namaḥ&rsquo; and 80 on for all the names set out by Raghavabhatta on sāradātilaka 25. 58, The Adganyasa (nyāsa on parts of the body) is illustrated as follows: om bṭdayāya namaḥ, om sirase svābi, sikhāyai vaṣat, om kavacıya hum, om netratrayāya (or netradvayāya) vaṣat, om astrāya phat&rsquo;. Several Purānas contain provisions about nyasa. The Garudapurāṇa (I. chapters 26, 31, 32) describes anganyāsa as part of worship, japa and homa The Nāradiyapurāṇa (II. 57. 13-14), the Bhāgavata (VI. 8, about 40 verses ), Brahma (60. 35-40 ) provide for nyāsa of the mantras &lsquo;om naino Nārāyaṇāya&rsquo;, and &lsquo;om Viṣnaye namaḥ&rsquo; The Kalikāpurāpa (chap. 77) deals with Mātýkānyāsa. The Smrtimuktāphala (Ahnika pp. 329-331) quotes several passages dealing with nyāsa of the 24 letters of the Gāyatri (Rg. III, 62.10 ) on several parts of the body, meditation on each of the 24 letters as having certain colours of flowers and as identical with certain gods and avatāras and nyāsa of the Gāyatripādas on limbs.

The latter work (Sm. O, L p. 145) also contains Anganyāsa of several portions of Gayatri, the nyāse of the single letters of the Gayatri on the limbe and Aparārka (p. 140 ) quotes &amp; passage for the employ mant of the sixteen verses of the Purusasūkta (Rg.

The Mahanirvana ( V. 176-178 ) also specifies the limbs on which there is to be ayaga of the letters of the alphabet from the forehead downwards.</p>
<p>The above passages show that the item of nyasa was taken over from Tantrika works in the Parāgas for the rites of the orthodox people several conturies before Yogayājöavalkya, Apariska (first half of 12th century A. D.) and the Smrti candrika. The Varsakriyakaumudi 1823 ( about first half of 16th century) shows that long before it the Garuda and the Kālika puranas contained provisions on nyaste The Dovapratisthā tattya of Raghunandana (p. 505) speaks of Matrkānyāsa and Tattvanyaan The Pūjāprakasa section of the Viramitrodaya dwells upon Matṛkānyāsa, Anganyāsa, Gayatrinyāsa on pp. 130, 131, 132 rospectively. The Bhaktiprakasa (pp. 88-89) of the same work deals with Mātrkānyāsa. In modern times some orthodox people still perform two kinds of nyl8as as follows: The Antarmātrks which consists in the mystia assignment (mentally ) of the letters of the alphabet (fron &lsquo;a&rsquo; to kṣa&rsquo;) on the fingers of the hands and on the palm and back of the bands and on several parts of the body viz. the throat, orgads of geno ration, the adhāra place and the middle of the eyebrow (as the Bests of the six psychic cakras mentioned in note 1715 above ). The Bahirmātśkānyiga consists in assigning the individual alphabet letters with anusvāra on each on the limbs from head to feet in such forms as &lsquo;ām damaḥ mūrdhni&rsquo; and so on.</p>

Raghavabhatta states that the fingers from the thumb to the small ingor are identified with the five alements vis. Skasa ( aky or other), wind, fire, water and earth and that their contact with each other tends to make the deity favourable and delighted and induces the deity to be present at the worship, and that various appropriate mudrās are to be employed in worship, at the time of japa, in meditation and in all rites performed for securing some desired object or benefit, since they induos the deity to be prosent (near the worslip per 1837). It was supposed that mudras helped in enhancing concentration on the part of the worshippor. Even as early as the 7th century it was believed that the making of mudrās may bring to life one who, being poisoned had fallen into coma, as the Kādambari quoted below shows. The Varsakriya kanmudi quotes &amp; verbe saying that japa, prānāyāma, worship of gode, yoga, meditation and asanas are fruitless unless accompanied by appropriate mudrās.</p>

<p>Number of mudrūs in different storico</p>
<p>f195</p>
<p>The H. of Dh. Yol. II. (pp. 320-321 ) makes a brief mention of mandras in worship and refers to the work of Mlae Tyra de Kleen on the mudris practised by Bauddha and Saiva priests called pedandus in the island of Bali. Here the same subject will be dealt with in a little more detail and from different</p>
<p>points of view.</p>
<p>There is a great divergence among the Tantra, Purana and Yoga works on the number, names and definitions of mudrās. This may be briefly illustrated.</p>
<p>In the Tantrik texts (Vol. I. pp. 46-47) there is a nighanta (a glossary or enumeration) of mudrās with names and defini. tions, where it is stated that nine mudrās (āvāhani and others) are common (1. a. capable of being employed in any worship): and then are enumerated mudrās specially appropriate to Visnu worship (19 in all viz. Saṅkha, Cakra, Gadā, Padma, Vemo, Śrlvataa, Kaustubha, Vanamālā, Jñana, Vidya, Garuda, Nara simhi, Varāhi, Hayagrivi, Dhanus, Bāṇa, Paraśu, Jagan-mohini, Vāma; ten of Siva (Linga, Yoni, Trisala, Aksamala, Abhiti i.o. abhaya, Mrga, Asikā, Khatvānga (&amp; olub with &amp; skull at the top), Kapala, Damaru; one of the Sun (viz. Padma); seven of Ganesa (Danta, Paśa, Ankusa, Avighna, Paśu, Ladduka, Bijapūra ( i. e. a oitron ) 189</p>
<p>The Sārādatilaka (23. 106-114) names only nine nudras and defines them, while the Viṣpusambitā (VII) says that mudrās are innumerable (verso 45), names about thirty and defines them and Jõānārṇava (IV ), mentions at least nineteen, The Jayakhyagamhita ( 8th Patala ) has about 58 mudrās. The Tantrik 1840 works provide that mudrās should be praotised</p>

<p>These Modrās are also mentioned in a work called Mudra laksana (D.C. M8. 291 of 1887-91). Some of these mudrās in connection, with the worship of individual goda ocenr in Vippusambitā VII and in Jõānārpava IV. The Madrānighanta games and defines mudrās of Sakti, Agai, Triporā and other deities. The madras specially appropriate in the worship of Viṣgu, such as Saakba, Cakra, Gadā, Padma, Kaustubha, Srivatsa, Vanamalā, Vena are described in &amp; work called Naradatantra quoted by Varrakriyakaumudi pp. 154-156.</p>

The Kāmakalāvilaga of Pupyānanda expre saly mentions ( in Forde 46) Trikhanda-mudra and refers to the fact that there are nine mudria, tai The Nityagodasikārnava (3rdvisrāms) first defines Trikhanda, then names and defines nine mudrās most of which bear names difforent from those in the Sāradatllaka. The Mudras mentioned by Nity &amp;ṣodasika apart from Trikhanda, are: Sarvasaiksobhakarial, Sarvaridravint, Akarṣini, Sarvivegakarl, Unmadini, Mahaakuba, Khecari, Bijamudra, Yonimudra.</p>
<p>The Jhanarnava Tantra (IV. 31-47 and 51-56 and xv.47 68) names over thirty mudras, several of which bear the sanno name as those in Nityaṣodaśikārṅava, are defined in a similar way and are quoted by Bhāskararaya in his commentary on the latter work. In these circumstances the author proposes to name and describe first of all the nine mudrās of the Saradatilake. 1842 (1) Avahani mudra consists in folding both hands in a hollow and filling the hollow completely with flowers; (2) sthapanl is the same as āvāhanl but the folded bands are held upride down; (3) the sannidhāpana-mudra&rsquo; occurs when the two hands are formed into a closed fist, are joined together with only the</p>

<p>Some of the works on Yoga describe various mudras. For example, the Hathayogapradipikā (III. 6-23) describes at length ten mudrās and the Gherandagamhitā (III, 1-3) speaks of 25 mudrās and describes them in one hundred verses. The Śivasanahita (IV. 15–31 ) mentions ten mudrās as the best. An Important mudrā in Hathayoga practices is the Kheoarlmudra described in Dovibhagavata XI.86.62-65, sivasamhita IV. 31-33, Gherandasambita III. 25-27, Hathayogapradipikā II. 32-53, This description differs from the definition of Khecari in Jñānārnava (15. 61-63) and Nityaṣodaśikārṇava II. 15-83. The Vajrolimudri ( in Hathayogapradipikā. III. 82-96) cannot be set out here for reasons of decency and it was supposed to pro long the life of a yogin even after indulgence in sexual orgies.</p>
<p>Some of the Puranas contain an extensive treatment of mudrās. The Kallkāpurāna mentions anganyāsa, karanyāsa in obap. 66 and mudrās like Dhenumudra, Yonimudra, Mahamudrā, Khesarimudra in 70. 36-56, 78. 3-6; Devibhagavata (XI. 16. 98-102 ) speaks of 24 mudrās at the time of Gayatri-japa; the Brahmapurāpa1858 and Naradiyapurāṇa set out eight mudrās</p>

<p>Most verses of the Brahmandapurana (in the Lalitopa. khyāns, chap. 42) are the same as in the Mudrānighandu pp. 55-57 versas 110-118; but the largest number of pudrās in dancing is contained in the Viṣğudhartottara (UI). In chap. 32 it speaks of numerous rabasya (secret) mudrās in prose called mudrahastas and in chap. 33 (1-124) it desoribes over ons hundred sāmānyamudrās and the colophon at the end of the Chapter calls them &lsquo;nśttasāatramudrās&rsquo; (mudrās in the science of dramaturgy ) 184! This opens up &amp; subject which cannot be gone into here, viz. whether the mystic hand poses (mudrāo) in worship were derived from the postures (karanas), recakas (gestures) and 32 angahāras (movements of limbs ) described in the Natyaśāstra 145 of Bharata (chapters 4, 8 and 9). It may be noted that the Nātyaśāstra (in IV. 171 and 173 ) speaks of #nrtta hastas&rsquo;. Pāpiui know natagūtras of Silalin and Kpgāsva 1846 Bharata speaks of four kinds of acting (abhinaya 8. 9-10) viz. añgika, vācika, āhārya, sad sāttviks.

<p>and the latter consisted of different arrangements of hands and fast. It is likely that the mudras in the Hindu and Buddhist Tantrik works are based on the poses that were evolved in anotent Indian dance and drama and that find their earliest extant description in Bharata-bātyaśāstra and that are also to be found in later medieval works on dramaturgy such as the Abbinayadarpaṇa.1847</p>
<p>The Aryamañjusrimūlakalpa names and defines 108 mudrās (p. 380). On p. 376 it states that the combination of mudras and mantrag would bring success in all actions and neithor tithi, nor naksatra nor fasting would be required. In the Viṣnu dharmottarapurāṇa 1848 there is a fine eulogy of the mudrās made in dancing viz. they are the graces of the rich, the removers of the sorrow of the distressed, the instruction of the ignorant, the increase of the blessedness (or charm ) of women; they were created by Vāsudeva for the removal of portonts, as the means of prosperity and of the attainment of desired objects.</p>
<p>The Buddhists also had mudrās. One of the early works of the Mahāyāna school viz. Aryamañjustimūlakalpa is full of mudrās in the 35th patala (pp. 355-381) and states (on p. 380) that there are 108 mudrās. 1849 L. H. Waddell in the Buddhism of Tibet or Lamaism' (London, 1895) describes nine mudrās practised in Tibet by the Lamas (pp. 336-337).</p>
<p>In the Indian Antiquery, yol 26 (1897), pp. 24-25, Burgess mentions nine Buddhist mudrās (slightly differing from Waddell&rsquo;s descriptions) as follows:-(1) Bhūmisprs or Bhūmi sparsa mudrā, an attitude of Sākya Buddha (&lsquo;making the earth as witness ); (2) Dharmaoakra mudrā (teaching attitude); (3) Abhaya mudrā (of blessing), in which the left hand is open</p>

<p>The Jainas also had mudrās. In J. O. I. (Baroda), vol. VI. No. 1 pp, 1-35 Dr. Priyabala Shah contributes an interesting paper on two Jaina works, one of which called Mudrāvicāra describes 73 mudrās and the other called Mudrāvidhi lists 114 mudrās.</p>
<p>In a recent work &lsquo;Royal conquests and cultural migrations&rsquo; Mr. C. Sivaramamurti (Calcutta, 1955) remarks (on p. 43) that the &lsquo;hastas&rsquo; and &lsquo;karanas&rsquo; on the Gopura at Chidambaram are found also in the Siva temple at Prambanan in Jaya, where one can observe many of the huranas like Patākā, Tripatāka, Ardhacandra, Sikhara, Kartarlmukha, Sūci and hastas like Añjali, Puspaputa. In another recent work &lsquo;Contributions to the History of the Indian Drama&rsquo; by Dr. Manomohan Ghosh (Calcutta, 1958) it is stated that in the bas-reliefs of Bayon (Angkor Thom ) certain aspects of the Cambodian dance and drama, particularly certain gestures depicted and actually observed in practice now in the dances in the royal palace, are similar to those described in the Nātyaśāstra of Bharata such as Añjali, Patākā, Ardhacandra, Musti, Candrakalā and Kapota (p. 63).</p>
<p>Some Sanskrit medieval Dharmaśāstra works from the 13th century A. D. dilate at some length on mudrās. Homādri on Vrata (vol. I. pp. 246-247) speaks of mudrās called Mukula, Pankaja, Niṣthura and Vyoma. The Smṛticandrikā (1st half of 13th century A.D.) names and defines 24.mudrās (I. pp. 146–147). The names are the same as in Devibhāgavata XI. 16. 98-10%. The Pūjāprakāśa (part of Viramitrodaja) defines in all 32 mudrās of which eight, viz. Ārāhani, Sthāpani, Sannidhāpani, Sarnrodhini, Prasāda, Avagunthana, Sammukha, Prarthana are common to the worship of all gods, some are specially appropriate</p>

<p>in Viṣṇu worship, come in worship of the Sun, Lakṣmi and Durgā and the Aõjali and Sambāra mudrās ( the last two) used in the worship of all goda. The Āhnikaprakasa (part of Viramitrodaya) names 24 mudrās to be shown at the time of the japa of Gayatri (pp. 298–299 ) which are the same as in Davi bhāgayata XI. 16. 98-102, but it quotes them as from Brahmā. 1850 It is diffioult to say what work is meant by Brahmā. Mudrās were not universally praotised. It is clear from the Dharmasindhu and Samskāra-ratnamālā quoted in note 1831 that Nyāsa and Mudrā were held to be non-vedic in Mahārāṣtra at least.</p>
<p>Another item in the Tantrik worship is that of Mandala which has been algo a prominent feature of orthodox Hindu practices in medieval and modern times. But it cannot be said that the concept of mandalas was borrowed by Sanskrit writers from the Tantrikas. The word was used in the sense of orb or circle. In the Tai. S. V. 3.9. 2 reference is made to circular bricks (mandalestakā); vide also Sat. Br. IV. I. 1. 25. The orb of the Sun is also called the wheel (cakra) in Rg. IV, 28.% and V. 29. 10. The Br.

<p>circular) drawn on an altar and the like. In the Sulbasūtras of Åpastamba and Katyayana reference is made to the squaring of a circle (mandala).1952 The Matsyapurāṇa refers in several passages to mandalas drawn with powders of five colours (as in 58. 22). It also refers to the figure of a lotus of twelve or eight patals drawn with saffron or red sandalwood paste or with various colours (72. 30; 62. 15; 64. 12–13; 74. 6-9 a lotus figure with eight patals and pericarp for sun worship). Varābamihira in Bṛ. 8. (chap. 47) describes 1853 a very auspicious ceremony called Pusy aspāna in which a mandala was to be drawn on holy ground with powders of different colours in which positions were to be assigned to gods, planets, stars etc. The Brahmapurāṇa ( 28, 28 ) mentions the invocation of the Sun on the figure of a lotus and Brahmapurāpa ( 61. 1-3) about the worship of Nārāyana on a mandala in the form of a lotus is quoted by Raghunadana in Puruṣottama-tattva (p. 569). The Harṣacarita 1854 (first half of 7th century A. D.) refers to a large mandala being drawn in several colours. The Varahapurāṇa refers to the images or paintings of Lakṣmi and Nārāyana in a mandala for worship (chap. 99. 9-11). The Agnipurāṇa (chapter 320 ) refers to eight mandalas, Sarvatobhadra and others. Several mandalas are described in Sāradātilaka III. 113–118, 131-134, 135-139 (davanabhamandala ), in Jñānārṇava 26. 15-17 and other works.

<p>residence for kings or rich people. The Sāradatilaka (III. 106 130 ) deals at length with the construction of a Sarvatobhadra mapdala and remarks that it is common to all worship 1856 and provides (III. 122–124) that the mandala should be drawn with five coloured powders viz. yellow with turmeric powder, white produced from husked grains of rice, red with Kusumbha powder, black with the fine powder of half burnt inferior cereals sprinkled with milk and greenish with powder of the leaves of bilva. The Prapancasāra (V. 64-65) and Agni (30. 19-20) provide for similar coloured powders. The Vāstuyāgatattva of Raghunandana (p. 416 ) quotes the Sāradātilaka (III. 123-124) about the five powders. The Jõānārnavatantra ( 24. 8-10 and 26. 15-17 ) appears to hold that mandala and cakra are synonyms and states that a mandala with nine angles may be drawn on an altar in a pavilion (mapdapa ) with saffron or vermilion powder, 1857 The Mahānirvāṇatantra also refers to mandalas drawn with coloured powders (X. 137–138). Four characteristics of mandala ceremonies are mandala, mantra, pūjā and mudrā.</p>
<p>The Buddhist tantras also make much of mandalas. In the Manjusrimūlakalpa mandalas are described with special direc tions for painting them. The Guhyasamājatantra speaks of a mandala of 16 cubits with a cakra inside. Vide Prof. G. Tucci&rsquo;s &lsquo;Indo-Tibetica&rsquo; vol. IV part I (Rome, 1941) which gives tables containing mandalas and A.

The Niṣpannayogāvali (G, O.S.) of Abhayākara gupta, &amp; contemporary of Rāmapāla, king of Bengal ( 1084-1130 A. D.), describes 26 mandalas in 26 chapters, each mandala having a central deity and other minor Buddhist divinities, sometimes more than one hundred in number, 1858</p>

<p>Another characteristio item in Tantrik worship is &lsquo;yantra&rsquo; (geometrical diagram ), sometimes called cakra also, which one finds to some extent also in the Puranas and slightly in modern orthodox practices. A yantra is a diagram (or figure ) engraved, drawn or painted on metal, stone, paper or other material. It resembles a mandala but differs from it in this that &amp; mandala may be employed in the worship of any demtā, while a yantra is specially appropriated to the worship of a particular deity or employed for a particular purpose. The Kulārnava-tantra 1860 states; &lsquo;Yantra is a development (or product) of mantra and a deity apprehended in the form of a mantra ; the deity worshipped on the yantra immediately becomes favourable; yantra is so called because it removes all pains (or perturbations) arising from such faults as love and anger; if God is worshipped in yantras, he is pleased&rsquo;. The same Tantra further says if worship is done without a yantra the devata is not pleased', Here the word &lsquo;yantra&rsquo; is derived from the root &lsquo;yantr&rsquo;. In another place the same tantra states &lsquo;Yantra is so deolarad because it always saves (the worshipper) from Yama (god of death) and goblins and other dangers&rsquo;. The Rāmapūrvatāpaniya Upanisad 1861 observes the arrangement (or preparation) of a yantra is the body of the deity which confers safety'. The Kaulivalinirṇaya observes &lsquo;worship (of a deity) without employ ing &amp; yantra, satiating the goddess) without offering flesh, drinking wine without being accompanied by a Sakti (the wife or other woman associated with a Sakta worabipper )-all these yield no fruit.&rsquo; Some works evolved a &lsquo;yantra-gāyatri&rsquo; also. 1867</p>

<p>These passages make it clear that a yantra was deemed to be a factor belping in restraining the restless movements of the mind due to anger, love and the like and in making the mind concentrate on a diagram or model deemed to represent the deity worshipped. It induced concentration and encouraged the mental realization of the deity. The distinction between the dercyū and yantra is similar to that between the soul and the body. Most Hindus look upon such forms of worship without antipathy because it is felt that they serve as a way of approach to divinity for ordinary unsophisticated people and that it is better to have one&rsquo;s foot on the lowest rung of the ladder to higher life than to bave it on no rung at all.</p>
<p>Yantras are described in such Tantrik and other works as Tripurātāpani Upariṣad (II. 3), Prapancasāratantra (patalas 21 and 34), Sāradātilaka (VII. 53-63, XXIV), Kamakalāvilāsa (verses 22, 26, 29, 30, 33), Nityāsodaśikārnava (I. 31-43) Nityotsava (pp. 6,64-5), Tantra-rājatantra (II. 44-51, VIII, 30 ff. XXXIII), Ahirbudhnyasamhita (chap. 23-26), Mantramaho dadhi (20th Taranga), Kaulajñānanirnaya (X, which speaks of them as cakras), Kaulāvalīnirnaya (III. 105–135), Merutantra (33rd prakāśa, 562 vorses), Mantramahārnava-tantra (Uttard khanda, 11th taranga). It is not possible to deal with all this large material here. The Padma (Pātālakhanda, 79. 1) provides that the worship of Hari (Vispu) may be performed on the Salagrāma stone or on a jewel or a yantra, a mandala, or images, and not merely in a temple. The Ahirbudhnya-sambitā (chap. 36, verses 5-66) describes the procedure of the worship of a Sudarsana-yantra by a king or other personage desiring wealth or prosperity. One yantra or cakra may be explained and illustrated here. The most noted is óricakra described in two verses quoted 1853 below and explained in some detail in the</p>

<p>Setubandha commentary on Nityāṣodaśikārṅava (I. 31-46), The latter verses explain how the Cakra is to be drawn with the bindu in a small triangle. The bindu represents Sakti or Mūla praksti solidified. In published works on Tantra the śricakra is represented in colours ( as in Saundaryalahari published by Ganesh &amp; Co. Madras, 1957, facing the title page ), while others represent it only by means of plain uncoloured lines (as on the outer cover of the above edition of Saundaryalahari or on the cover of the Kāmakalāvilāsa od. by A. Avalon and published by Ganesh and Co. 1953). In some works the figure of Srioakra shows no gates as on the cover in &lsquo;Principles of Tantra&rsquo; by A. Avalop or on the cover of Kāmakalāvilāsa, while gates are shown in other works ( as in the above edition of Saundaryala hari before the Sanskrit text). There are nine triangles, five of whioh have their apex pointing downwards and those represent Śakti and four (representing Siva) have an apex pointing up wards. The bindu is situated in the smallest triangle pointing downwards. Then there are two pairs of ten triangles ( shown in some books as blue and red respectively), then fourteen triangles (coloured blue in some works), then eight-petalled lotus (sometimes coloured red), 16 petalled lotus ( coloured blue), then three circles, then three boundary lines with four gates, these two latter being the outer sections of the yantra and the lotuses of 8 and 16 petals being the inner section of the yantra. There are in all 43 angles (some works make 44). The part of the Cakra within the boundary lines is called bhūpura. The worship of yantra is bahiryāga (outer or external worship of Śakti). The internal worship (antaryāga) consists in taking the awakened Kundalini through the cakras from Mūlādhāra to Ajmkoakra and then uniting it with the Lord Siva in the Saham Srāra-oakra, the six cakras from Mūlādhāra being identified with</p>

C, ms.No. 490 of 1895-98) quotes the verse pretenos&hellip;garant: (op folio 31 a) but also cites another verse describing this somewhat differently. Cakras are differently enumerated in different works. For example, in D. C. me. No. 962 of 1884–1887 called Fires, five cakras employed in the worship of Durgā according to Kaulāgama are raras, HETE, 9 , am and T (Cat. vol. XVI. on Tantra p. 163 ), while in another ms. D, C. No 964 of 1887-91, several other cakras are described such as STATT, orange, trann, 7 (Cat. vol. XVI. OR Tantra p. 251).</p>

<p>the five elements and mind. This la described in Saundaryala. hari (verse 9). To what lengths &lsquo;Sakti&rsquo; worshippers had gone in the worship of Devi by the bahiryāga method would be clear from a passage quoted from the commentary of Lakṣmidbara, almost the latest among the numerous commentators of the Saundaryalahari, who was horrified by the methoda of Kaulikas. 1864</p>
<p>The Setubandha on Nityāṣodaśikārnava is at great pains to emphasize that the worship of Tripurasundari is of the nature of upāsanā and not of the nature of bhakti and that this upāsanā is of two sorts, one consisting of the recitation of the mantra of the Devi and the other consisting of the worship of the yantra1865 (or cakra). Verses 126-204 of the Nityasodasi kārṇava detail the different items in the worship of the Sricakran The Nityaṣodaśikā and other Tantrik works say that the great Tripurasundari is seated in the Sricakra,1866 The great aim of the Sākta sādhaka is apparently to realize his identity with the yantra, the mantra, the guru and Tripurādevi. The Varṣakriya kaumudi quotes a verse stating that worship of yantra performed with all mantras is commended and by 80 doing a worshipper</p>
<p>may secure whatever he desires.1867</p>
<p>Even a comparatively sober work like the Sāradātilaka provides for the drawing up of yantras for wicked purposes. For example, in VII. 58-59 it describes an Agneya-yantra to be drawn on a garment secured from a pile in a cemetery and buried near the house of one&rsquo;s enemy for the latter&rsquo;s destruction.</p>

<p>At the end of this chapter on Tāntrik doctrines and practices reference must be made to a remarkable circumstance. The Sarvadarsanasamgraha of Sāyana-Mādhava (14th century A.D.), that deals with 15 Darsanas (points of view or philosophical views), has not a word to say about Tantras, though it devotes considerable space to the atheistic Cārvāka-darsana and the unorthodox Bauddha and Jaina systems. It is impossible to believe that the most learned brothers Sayapa and Madhava wore unaware of the works on Tantra. The silence must be due to some special reason. If one may make a conjectura, it appears that Tantrik doctrines were discarded for the same reasons that induced the Bengal king Balialasena in his Dānasāgara to exclude the Devīpurāṇa from the authorities on which he meant to rely. At the time when Sayapa and Madhava flourished (about middle of 14th century A. D.) Tantrik doctrines and practices had come into great disrepute. Therefore, Tantrik doctrines were probably passed over in silence by Siyapa Madba ya..</p>

D. and that Advayavara sangraha and Sekoddeśatika borrow from Hevajra-tantra, Sadhanamālā No. 229 (two opening verses) are the same as Havajra II. 8. 6–7. Hovajra is an invocation of vajra. On p. 11 part I the editor questions how the yoging could call themselves Buddhists when they experienced enlightenment in the embrace of a yogini. Part I p. 70 mentions Jālandbara, Oddiyana, Paurṇagiri as pithas and several upapīthas, upa kṣetras. The term Sakti does not ocour in Hevajra but its place is taken by Prajñā. Part II verses 11-15 p. 98 express how the followers of this tantra had sexual experi enoos with women called mudrās and how thereby they secured siddhi. Part I p. 54 contains ritual for gaining mastery over a young woman. Part II p. 2 states &lsquo;Heka roṇa mahākarupā vajram Prajñā ca bhanyate; Prajñopāyat makam tantram tan-me nigaditam srupu&rsquo;.

The present author repudiates totally this assertion. The author of this booklet has to admit that in the case of the Tantrik cult that abuse of the body of occult knowledge for malevolent purposes instead of for the material and spiritual advancement of man and the vulgarization of the profound rationale of the mystic ritual are deplorable deformations (p. 36), that there has doubtless been a grobs misuse of the knowledge developed by this science and that sparious texts have sprung up (p. 21).</p>

<p>CHAPTER XXVIII MĪMĀŃSA AND DHARMASĀSTRA</p>
<p>VI</p>
<p>The Yājñavalkya-smrti provides that there are fourteen sources of vidyās (knowledge ) and of Dharma, 1863 viz. Purāna, Nyāya, Mimāṁsā, Dharmaśāstra, Angas (six) and the Vedas (four). A similar verse is quoted by some as Manu&rsquo;s, but it is not found in the extant Manusmrti. It is therefore necessary to consider the origin and meaning of the word Mimāmsā, to set out the principal doctrines of that Sāstra, to mention the important rules of interpretation and the maxims of the Mimāṁsā in their application to topics of Dharmaśāstra and to refer to some of the important works of that Śāstra together with their approximate dates.</p>
<p>The word mimāmgā has a great antiquity behind it. The Tai. 8. VII, 5. 7. 1 1869 says &lsquo;the expounders of Brahma (Veda) discuss ( the question) whether a day should be omitted or not&rsquo;. Here the verbal form &lsquo;mimamsante&rsquo; is employed in the sonse of discussing or investigating a doubtful point and arriving at &amp; decision thereon. In another passage of the Tai. 8. the same form</p>

<p>and another &lsquo;mimamseran&rsquo; are used in the same sense.. In Beveral other places the Tai, 8. raises points for discussion with the words &lsquo;the brahmayadins discuss&rsquo; but without employing the word mimamsante or a cognate word. Vide Tai.s. II 5.3.7 (about the deity of sānnāyya), V.5. 3. 2, VI. 1. 4.5., VI. 1. 5. 3-5. The Kathaka Samhita 1870 guts forward a doubtful point for investigation without the words &lsquo;Brahmavādins say&rsquo;, but with the word &lsquo;mimāṁgante&rsquo;. The Atharvaveda 1871 etates &lsquo;men separately discussing many times noted on the earth her actions&rsquo;. In another place it employs the words mimāinsita and mimamsamana. The Saṅkhayana 182 Br. has they discuss the question whether one should offer homa after the sun rises or before the sun rises&rsquo;. The Tai. Br. employs the word mimamsa and the Satapatha also in the Kāṇva recension doos 80 (vide S. B. E. vol. 26 note 1). In the Chandogyopaniṣad 1873 it is stated that five scholars very learned in the Veda and possessed of large houses (wealth) named Prācīnaśāla Aupamanyava and others got together and entered upon the consideration of the question &lsquo;what is (the nature of) our self and what is Brahma-2&rsquo;. In the Tai. Up. occur the words this is the investigation into (the nature of ) Bliss (Brahma)&rsquo;. In both thege passages the word</p>
<p>mimamsa is used in the sense of &lsquo;consideration&rsquo; (vicarana) of high philosophical topics.'</p>
<p>Pāṇini provides 1874 for the formation of seven roots with san affix (Desiderative), one of which is &lsquo;mimamsate&rsquo; from</p>

<p>&lsquo;man&rsquo; and the Kāśikā adds that it means desire to know 1e. investigation and final conolusion&rsquo;, having in view probably the sūtras &lsquo;Athāto dharma-jijñāsa&rsquo; and Athāto brahma-jijñākt &lsquo;.</p>
<p>The foregoing brief discussion shows that long before the Upaniṣads the word &lsquo;mimamgā&rsquo; had come to mean &ldquo;investi. gation into a topio of discussion and coming to a conclusion thereon&rsquo;. The same word acquired a restricted sense ( as in the verge of Yāj. quoted above) viz. investigation into Dharma and arriving at conclusions on doubtful matters by interpretation and reasoning.</p>
<p>Some of the Dharmasūtras disclose familiarity with purely Mimāmsā terms and principles. For example, Gaut. states 1875 that an option is allowed only when there is a conflict between two texts of equal authority. The Apastamba Dharmasūtra is the only Dharmasūtra that contains numerous Mināmsā terms and doctrines. It says &lsquo;a positive Vedic text bas more force than an usage which merely leads to ao inference (of its being based on a Vedic text now lost)&rsquo;. 1876 This is similar to Jaimini I. 3. 3</p>
<p>• If there is a conflict (between an express Vedic text and a gmrti text) the latter is to be discarded but if there be no conflict an inference may be drawn (that the smrti text is based on some Śruti). Ap. say, &lsquo;the rules about anadhyāya ( stopping Veda study on parvan &amp;c.) are applicable only to learning the Vedic mantras and not to their application in sacrifices&rsquo;. In another place Áp. provides where activity takes place because of finding pleasure therefrom (i. e. from a worldly motive), there is no (inference of its being based on ) sāstra&rsquo;, which is similar to Jaimini&rsquo;s rule. For reasons of space other examples of close agreement between Āp. Dh. S. 1871 and Jaimini are simply referred</p>

Bamaya&rsquo; (the siddhānta or doctrine of those who know Nyāya) and &lsquo;Nyāyavidaḥ&rsquo;, it follows that he is referring to some work on Mimāmgā or some author who composed a mlmāmgā-sūtra. The correspondence in ideas and words between Ap. and the Pūrvamimāmsāsūtra is so olose that one is tempted to argue that Āp. know either the extant mlmārsāsūtra or at least an earlier version of it containing almost the same expressions. It will not do to say that all the above passages are later intor. polations. They have all been commented upon by Haradatta.</p>
<p>Some Srautasūtras such as that of Kātyāyana contain rules of the interpretation of Vedic texts that are similar to Jaimini&rsquo;s gūtras and sometimes are stated almost in the same words. 1870</p>

<p>It may be noted that P. M. S. writers are often called &lsquo;Nyaya. vidah&rsquo; by Saṅkara (on V. S. III. 4. 22 ), by Viśvarūpa and others. Bbāskara in his commentary on Brahmasūtra (1. 1. 1. p. 5, Chowkhamba series ) states: यच्छब्द आह तदस्माकं प्रमाणमिति हि न्यायविदः. These are the words of Sabara in his bbāsya on P. M. S. III, 2. 36. Oo Yaj. I. 58 the Balakrida of Viśvarūpa says &ldquo;Tatbā ca aaiyāyikāḥ, &lsquo;na bi vacapasyatibharosti tyābab&rsquo;&rdquo;. These are the words of Sabara on Jaimini III, 2.3 viz. &lsquo;Kimiva vacanam na kurgāt sāsti vacadasyā tibbārab&rsquo;. So here Sabara is called Naiyāyika. On Yāj. I. 53 the Balakrida says &lsquo;Nyāyavidasca Yajñikāḥ i api vā sarvad barmah syāt tannyāyatvād vidhānasya&rsquo;. This last is Jal. I 3. 16 So here Jaimiai is called Nyayavid and Yājāika. Similarly, on Yaj. I. 87 the Bālakrida quotes Jai. VI. 8. 17 as the words of Nyāyavido yajāikih&rsquo;. The J. N. M. V. says nyāyas are the adhikaranas, deciding points of Dharma and expounded by Jaimini &lsquo;जैमिनिमोक्तानि धर्मनिर्णायकान्यधिकरणानि Föret:.&rsquo; The writers of Srautasūtras are called merely Yājõikes by Balakrida on Yaj. I. 38 &ldquo;Tathā ce yājõikāḥ vyavabāryā bhavanti itgāhuh&rsquo;. This quotation is from Kātyāyana Srautasūtra 22. 4. 27-28. Besides, the sūtra &ldquo;Prāyaścittavid bānācca,' is the same in both Kāt. $. I. 2. 19 and P. M. S. VI. 3. 7 and Kat. $. I. 8. 6 is the same as P, M, S, XII. 3, 15; moreover, Kāt. Ś. IX, 11, 14-15 employ almost the same words as ia P.M.S. III. 5. 36–39, though they hold opposite views. The P. M. S. (IV. 4. 19-21) holds that the Piodapitryajña is not an anga of the rites on darta (1. o. Amavāsya ), but an independent rits, while the Kāt. Sr. (IV. 1. 28-30) holds that it is an anga.

S. 28-30 with Jai. VL 6. 3. Sometimes, the Kāt. S. takes a view opposite to that of the Pūrvamimāṁsā but the words are often almost the same.</p>
<p>The Vārtikas of Kātyāyana on Pāṇini and the Mahābhāsya show that Mimāmsā technical terms and doctrines had been elaborated long before them. For example, the Vārtikas employ the technical Mimāṁsā terms &lsquo;prasajyapratiṣedha&rsquo; (Vārtika 7 on Pāṇini I 1.44, Vārtika 5 on 1.2.1, Vārtika 2. on VI. 3.85), paryudāsa (Vārtika 3 on I. 1. 27 ), the word &lsquo;Sastrātidosa&rsquo; (ip, Vārtika on VII, 1. 96), the distinction between &lsquo;niyama&rsquo; and</p>
<p>vidhi' (in Vārtika 1 and 2 on III, 3. 163), the word &lsquo;prakarana&rdquo; (vārtika 4 on Vi. 2. 143). Patañjali&rsquo;s Mahābhāsya is full of Pārvamlmāṁsā matters. The word &lsquo;Mimamaaka&rsquo; occurs in bhāsya on Pāṇini II, 2. 29. The Mahābhāsya cites the well known passage the five five-nailed animals may be eaten&rsquo; and remarks that the sentence conveys that others than those five were not to be eaton, 1879 But Patanjali does not employ the word Parisankhyā of which the above (five) is an example, according to mimāmgā works. Jaimini employs the word:</p>

<p>Parisankhya in VII 3. 22. The Mahabhasya on IV. 1. 14 (vārtika 5) and on IV. 1. 93 (vārtika 9) gives valuable infor mation viz. a brahmana woman is called &lsquo;Kāśakftsnā&rsquo; if she studies the Mimāṁsā expounded by Kasakrtsni. 1880 This establishes that in Patañjali&rsquo;s time &amp; mlmāmgā work composed by Kaśam kpteni was in existence and women were found studying it. It is not certain what the Kāsakrtani-mImāmsā contained i. e. whether it was like the Pūrvamimamsā of Jaimini or it was like the Uttaramımāmsā (Vedāntasūtra) or dealt with both mimāmsā and vedānta, which latter is not unlikely. The V. 8. mentions the opinion of a teacher Kasaktana (in I. 4. 22), which Saṅkarācārya regards as the final conclusion supported by the real import of Śruti. The son of Kāśakrtsna might have been called Kāśakṣtsni (Pāpini IV, 1. 95). The Vārtikas and Patañjali are full of the discussion of important matters on which the Mimāṁsā has its own doofrines. In the Vārtikas 35 to 59 on Pāṇini I. 2. 64 (Sarūpāṇām-ekaśeṣa ekavibhaktau) there is a lengthy dicsussion on the question of the import of words, viz. whether it is akyti or vyaktı. It is said in Vārtika 35 that, according to Vājapyāyana, āksti is the import of a word, whilo, according to Vyaời (in Vārtika 45 dravyābhidhānam Vyādih), dravya (or vyakti ) is the import of a word (pada). The Mabā bhāsya notes that Panini wrote some sūtras (such as I. %. 58 * Jātyākhyāyām ' &amp;o) in which he accepted jāti as the import of words, while in other sūtras (such as I. 3,64 sarūpāṇām &lsquo;&amp;c) he</p>

<p>History of Dharmajāstra (Sec. VII, Ch. XXVIII</p>
<p>accepted &lsquo;dravya&rsquo; as the import of words. 1881 It is to be noted that, according to Jaimini (I.3.33 &lsquo;akrtistu kriyarthatvat). akti is the import of words. On Vartika 3 on Pan. IV. 1.92 (Bāmānyacodanāstu viśeṣeṣu) Patañjali says that the vidhis declared with reference to certain things and objects in general really apply to individuals and he gives purely mlmārsā examples in this connection as set out in the note. The Vartikan kira and Patanjali both use the word &lsquo;codana ' 1882 in the Purva mlmāmsā sense and give examples which are familiar to us from Śabarasbhāṣya. Among the purposes served by a study of grammar, nha (which is the subjeot of the 9th chapter of PMS) is one. On PaniniI.4.3 Patanjali uses the language of MImimsa &lsquo;apurva eva vidhirbhavisyati na niyamah.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It appears that the Saṅkarṣakāṇda was very much neglected from early times. There is a.conflict of views about its author ship. The Nyayaparisuddhi of Venkatanatha (I. H. Q. vol. Ix. at p. 299 ) states that Kāśakṛtsna was the author of the Saṅkara sakāṇda. It appears from Sabara&rsquo;s bhāsya that 1883 that Kānda existed in his day and was looked upon by him as Jaimini&rsquo;s work. Saṅkarācārya in his bhāsyaon V.S. III. 3. 43 (pradanavad. eva tad-uktam) mentions the Saṅkarsa, quotes a sutra therefrom, holds that it was known to the Vedāntasūtra and appears to convey that it was a work of Jaimini. Rāmāpuja also appears to hold that Jaimini was the author of 16 chapters ( comprising</p>

IIL. 3. 43, while conceding that the Saikarsakanda was under taken for discussion about devatās, insists that it is a pariṭiṣta (supplement) of the P. M. S. of twelve chapters consisting as it doos of discussions on several topics treated in the P.M. S. and being of a miscellaneous nature, that it does not begin with nor conclude with the discussion about devatās and that its first sutra is &lsquo;anuyajatiti anuvasatkaras-codyate&rsquo;. Since the Saṅkarsakāṇda has had hardly any influence on Dharmaśāstra works no further reference need be made to it in this work. 1894</p>

<p>In some works like the bhāṣya of Rāmānuja on V. 8. and the Prapancahrdaya 1886 the Mimāṁsāśāstra is stated to be as one whole containing twenty adhyāyas (chapters) and we are told that there was a (bhāsya) commentary called Kṭtakoti on the whole of it by Bodhāyana, that later on a concise commentary was composed by Upavarṣa, that Davagyāmin wrote a commentary</p>

<p>on 16 chapters and Bhavadāsa also composed &amp; commentary on Jaimini, but that Sabara wrote a bhāṣya only on the first 12 chap ters and did not comment on Saṅkarṣa. In I.H.Q. (vol. 15 pp. 262 263) reference is made to an inscription of Rājarāja (999 A. D.) which records the gift of certain lands to a learned brāhmaṇa who was to provide to four pupils board and teaching in several sub jects, one of which is specified as the mlmārsā of twenty adhyāyas. These 20 chapters are made up as follows:&ndash;12 chapters (each divided into four pādas, except chapters III, VI and X, each of which has eight pādas, in all sixty pādas) ascribed to Jaimini, 4 chapters called Saṅkarṣakāṇda and 4 chapters constituting the Vedāntasūtra. The twelve chapters often called Pūrvamimāṁs make an extensive work containing 915 or about one thousand adhikarañas (according to different writers) and about 2700 sūtras, dealing with numerous topics and laying down important rules of vodic interpretation. Yāj. (in I. 3) means by Mimāmsā probably the work of Jaimini in 12 chapters. Many writers such as Mādhayācārya 1887 speak of two Mimāmsās, Pūrva and Uttara, respectively comprising the 12 chapters ascribed to Jaimini and the four chapters forming the Vedāntasutra. Saṅkarācārya refers to the extant Pūrvanimāṁsā as Dvadaśa laksani in his bhāṣya on Vedāntasūtra III. 3. 26, as &lsquo;Prathama. tantra&rsquo; in bhāṣya on V. S. III. 3. 25. IIL 3. 53 and ILI. 4. 27, 89 Prathama-kāṇda in bhāsya on V. S. III. 3. 1, III, 3. 33, III. 3. 44, VII, 3, 50, as Pramāpalaksana in bhāsya on V. 8. III, 4, 42. On V. S. III, 3, 53 he speaks of the first pāda of the P. M. S. as .Śāstrapramukha ova prathame pāde&rsquo; and thereby conveys that he regards that the PMS and V8 form one entire śāstra.</p>
<p>From here onwards up to note 1890 the discussion is also comprised (though a little more briefly) in the present author&rsquo;s paper on &lsquo;Pūrvanimāmsā, Brabmasūtra &amp;c&rsquo; contributed to the Prof. De Felicitation volume (pp. 119-139 ).</p>
<p>There are very difficult and controversial questions about the authorship of the extant Pārvamimāmsāsūtra and of the extant Vedāntasūtra (or Brahmasūtra ) and their relation to each other. All of them cannot be gone into here. The first matter to be noted is that, though the number of the Vedantasūtras is only about 1/5th of the number of the P. M. 8., the V.8. contains</p>

<p>Jaimini and Badarāyana</p>
<p>1161</p>
<p>more personal references (i. e. 32) than the P. M. 8. (i.. 27). In the 2nd place, we find that the Vedāntasūtras mention Jaimini eleven times and Badarāyaṇa nine times, while the P. M. S. names Bādarāyana and Jaimini only five times each. The question arises whether Jaimini and Badarāyana were contemporaries and, if not, what the relation between the two was. Scholars are generally agreed that they were not contemporarios. There is a tradition of some antiquity contained in the Sāmavidhānabrāhmaṇa 1889 according to which. Jaimini was a pupil of Pārāśarya Vyāsa. It has been shown above (p. 857, note 1390) how the Purāṇas declare that Vyāsa Pārāśarya, also called Krsna Dvaipāyana, arranged the one Veda into four and imparted the Rgveda, Yajurveda, Sāmaveda and Atharvaveda respectively to Paila, Vaiśampāyana, Jaimini and Sumantu. In the Mahābhārata Sumantu, Jaimini, Vaiśampayana, Paila are stated along with Suka (the son of Vyasa ) to be the pupila of Vyāsa; vide Sabhā 4. 11 and Sāntiparva 328, 26–27 (cr. ed. 314, 23-21, 29) and 350. 11-12 (cr. ed, 337. 11-12). In the tarpana provided for in the Āśvalāyanagshyasūtra (III. 4. 4) occurs the very interesting passage &lsquo;Sumantu-Jaimini-Vaisan pāyana -Paila-Sūtra-bbāṣya-Bhārata-Mahābhārata-Dharmā cāryā). The above passages make it clear that several centuries before the Christian era Jaimini&rsquo;s was an honoured name and connected with the Samadeva. Scholars have examined the references to Jaimini and Bādarāyana in the P. M. S. and the V.S, Prof. K. A. Nilankanta Sastri in I. A. Vol. 50 pp. 167-174 on Jaimini and Badarāyana arrives at the somewhat startling conclusion that there were three Jaiminis. T.R. Chintamani on p. 14 of the supplement to J. O. R. Madras, Vol. XI agrees with Prof. Nilakanta Sastri. Jaimini is named five times in the extant P. M. S. viz, at III, 1, 4, VI. 3. 4, VIII, 3, 7, 1X. 2. 39, XII. 1.7. Commonsense requires us to hold that these five</p>

<p>references about Jaimini must bave been made to the same person. If two different Jaiminig were intended by the P. M. S. (other than its own author) in the five gūtras a clear waru ing would have been given by the author. As shown below &amp; sūtra should leave no ambiguity. Prof. Sastry holds that Jaimini mentioned in VI. 3. 4 is different from the Jaimini in the other four passages, because Sabara does not employ the word ācārya for qualifying Jaimini on VI. 3. 4 as he doos in the four other cases and because the view put forward in VI. 3. 4 appears to be Pūrvapakṣa, while in the four other Cases Jaimini&rsquo;s view is the siddhānt, view of the Mimārsā sūtra. The number of sūtras in which Jaimini is named is very small (only 5), out of which the word ācārya is applied to Jaimini by Sabara in four places and not so applied in one. This is a very slender and inadequate ground for holding that the Jaimini in P. M. S. VL 3.4 is different from the Jaimini namod in four other places. The usages of acāryas as to employment of qualifying words like &lsquo;ācārya&rsquo; or &lsquo;bhagavat&rsquo; to authors mentioned by them differ. Kumārila applies no epithat like &lsquo;ācārya&rsquo; or</p>
<p>bhagavān&rsquo; to Jamini and in one place 1887 charges Jaimini with composing sūtras containing not much substance. In the sūtras in which Jaimini is named in the VS (viz, in 1. 2. 28, I. 2. 31, I. 3.31, I, 4 18, III, 2. 40, LII, 4. 2, III, 4, 18, III, 4. 40, IV. 3.12, IV. 4. 5, IV. 4, 11) Saṅkarācārya adds the quali ficationācārya&rsquo; in all except on ILI. 4. 40, although Jaimini propounds many propositions not acceptable to Bādarāyana the author of V. S. or to Saṅkara. In III, 4. 40, however,1890 he omite the qualification &lsquo;ācārya&rsquo; as regards both Jaimini and Bādarā. yaga. No one has argued that because the word ācārya does not qualify Bādarāyaṇa in III, 4. 40, the Bādarayaṇa in that sutra is different from the Badarāyaṇa named in other sūtrag. In another place (on V. S. IV. 1. 17) it may be noted Saṅkari. cārya romarks that both Jaimini and Bādarāyaṇa are in agree ment that certain acts of the kamya type are of no help in</p>

<p>attaining real knowledge of brahma. This shows that according to Saṅkara, Jaimini had treated of how brahma-vidyā arises. As regards the second reason, it does not clearly or indisputably appear that VI 3. 4 is a pārvapakṣa view. In that adhikarana the Pūrvapaksa is stated in the first sūtra 1891 viz. as to suck nitya rites as Agnihotra or Darsapūrṇamāsa a man who can carry out all the details in their entirety is alone entitled to engage in them. The 2nd sūtra states the siddhānta view that, as regards nitya acts, it is not absolutely necessary that one should be able to perform all details (angas) therein; the third sūtra only states that smrti declares that it is a fault if the principal rite is not performed and therefore the principal rite being obligatory must be performed. Then comes the 4th sutra in which the name of Jaimini occurs. Sabara&rsquo;s bhasya on this sutra is extremely meagre (2} lines in print) and not clear. The Tup-tikā does not comment separately on each of the gūtras of VI. 3. 1-7, 1892 it omits the name of Jaimini in ita explanation and its concluding words on this adhikarang appear to support the interpretation of the 4th sūtra advanced by the present author. No one doubts that sūtras 5-7 support the siddhānta view. If VI. 3. 4 were a pūrva. pakṣa sūtra, it is expected that sūtra 5 should contain the word &lsquo;tu&rsquo; or &lsquo;api vā&rsquo; in order to indicate that it refutes the</p>

<p>view expressed in sūtra 4. What that sūtra moans is that the dropping of some angs in the nilya rite does not make that rite a different one from the same nitya rito when performed with all angas, since the text about its performance (with all anges or with some angas) is one and the same and the vedio instruction is that all angas have to be done ( if possible). Interpreted thus, that sūtra is not a pūrvapakṣa at all, but only emphasizes the siddhānta with additional reasons. The upshot would be that Jaimini mentioned five times in PMS is only one person and that he is a different person (who had written on P. M.) from the reputed author of the extant PMS.</p>
<p>A parallel may be cited. Saṅkarācārya makes one adhikarana of gūtras 26-33 of V.S. 1.3 (devatādhikarana) which establishes that not only inep but gods are qualified to study the Vedāntaśāstra and names Badarāyaṇa twice in the same adhikarapa (in I. 3. 26 and 33 ) and in I. 3.33 he employs the word &lsquo;tu&rsquo; because that sutra is a reply to Jaimini&rsquo;s viow contained in I. 3. 31-32. Similarly, the PMS puts forward the siddhanta view in VI. 3. 2 and naines Jaimini in VI. 3. 4 for the same purpose.</p>
<p>Even Prof. Sastry admits that in four out of the five references where Jaimini is expressly named, bis views are the siddhānta views. The cases of PMS IX. 2, 3 and XII. 1. 59 are somewhat remarkable. The adhikarapa in both cases consists of only one sūtra, which is the siddhanta view and Jaimini is expressly named therein. In PMS III. 1. 4 Jaimini differs from Bādari (III. 1.3) and two more sūtras are added to complete the adhikarapa. In PMS VIII, 3, 7 Jaimini&rsquo;s view is opposed to that of Bādari (VIII. 3. 6), is the siddhanta view and there is no separate sūtra setting forth the view of the author of the PMS.</p>
<p>From the remarks of Saṅkarācārya on V. 8. III, 4. 40 (quoted in note 1890) it follows that he regarded Bādarayaṇa as the author of the Vedāntasūtra. In V.S. III. 2. 38-39 the Siddhanta is stated that the rewards of actions are given by Isvara (God), while Jaimini&rsquo;s view is that it is Dharma that gives the rewards of actions (III. 2. 40) and in the next gūtra (III. 2. 41) it is stated that Bādarāyaṇa holds the former view (or that the former of the two, Isvara and Dharma, gives the reward is the view of Bādarāyana). Here Bādarāyaṇa is expressly mentioned as holding the same view as that in the Siddhantasūtra III. 2. 38.</p>
<p>Jaimini and Bādarayana</p>
<p>1165</p>
<p>The observations of Saṅkarācārya in introduoing 1893 the last sūtra of the V8 make it perfootly clear that he regarded Badarā. yaṇa as the author of the entire Vedāntasūtre. No satisfactory explanation is offered why it was necessary to mention Bādara yana nine times in the V8 when all the 555 sūtras thereof are deemed to have been composed by Bādarāyana, or why it was necessary to mention in a work containing about 2700 sūtras all deemed to be composed by Jaimini, the views of Jaimini five times when in all cases or at least in four out of the five cases the views are identical with the reputed author of the PMS. Only two theories are possible viz. to hold that there is no explanation or to hold that there were two Jaiminis and two Badarāyanas.</p>
<p>The problem of the author of the VS is rather complicated, Bhaskara (like Saṅkara) holds that Bādarāyana is the author of VS, since he begins his commentary on VS with an obeisance to Badarāyaṇa who sent forth (into the world) the Brahmasutra that brings about the cessation of the bondage of birth. The Pañcapādikā of Padmapada (a disciple of Saṅkarācārya performs ( in the 2nd Introductory verse) an obeisance to Bādara. yaṇa. 184 Rāmānuja, on the other hand, makes confusing statements. In the 2nd verse of his introduction to the Ścibhāsya 1895 on V8 he calls upon all good men to drink the nectar-like words of Pārāśarya, but in his bhāṣya on VS IL %. 42 he holds that Badarāyana was the author of the Maha bhārata, wherein the Pāñcarātra-sāstra is expounded at great length ( in Śāntiparva chap. 334-339 = cr. ed. 321 f.) as also of the VS 1896, But Yamunācārya, the preceptor of the teacher</p>

<p>History of Dharmalāstra (86c. VII, Oh. XXVIII</p>
<p>of Rāmānuja, ascribes the VS to Bādarāyana In spite of Saṅkarācārya, Vācaspati-misra, author of the fainous Bhamati on 1897 Saṅkarācārya&rsquo;s bhāsya on V8, makes an obeisance to Vedavyāsa, the author of Brahmasutra The Parāśara mādhaviya is in two minds; in vol. I part I pp. 52, 97, vol. II part 2 pp. 3 and 275 Bādarāyana is said to be the author of the VS, but in a few other places VS is spoken of as Vyāsasutra (vol. I part 1, pp. 56, 113). The above conflict of testimony gives rise to the important question whether Bādarāyapa, the supposed author of the Vedāntasūtras, is identical with Veda. vyāsa or is differeut from him. Saṅkarācārya&rsquo;s bhāsya points to the conclusion that in bis opinion at least they are different, 1898 For example, on V. S. I. 3. 29 he quotes a verge of Vedavyasa in support of the proposition of the VS that the Veda is eternal. On VS II. 3. 47, in support of the proposition that, though the individual soul is an amśa of the Supreme Self, the latter is not at all affected by the suffering of the individual soul, Saṅkara quotes two versos as smrti from the Mahābhārata. This makes it clear that, if the author of the VS was identical with Veda. Vyāsa, the author of the Mahābhārata, Saṅkarācārya would not have cited the latter as an independent smṛti source supporting the former or would at least have used some such language as * this very author bas said elsewhere that&rsquo; &amp;o. The same reasoning would apply to Saṅkarācārya&rsquo;s comments. If that great koārya was of the opinion that the author of the VS was the same as that of the Mahābhārata and the Gitā he would not have cited passages from the Epic and the Gitā as Smṛtis supporting the reasoning of the VS.</p>
<p>If it were contended that there is only one Jaimini (and not two, much less three) a serious difficulty arises. Why should the author of PMS ( containing about 2700 sūtras ) refer to him self by name in five places only. The usual explanation offered</p>

<p>Jaimini and Badarāyana</p>
<p>1167</p>
<p>by some commentators when Papini names 1899 his predecessors, viz, that they are named for showing his reverence for them, would be of no avail as to Jaimini, since it cannot be said that the author of PMS Jaimini shows respect to himself. When Jaimini mentions Bādarāyana in I. 1. 5 and XI, 1. 65 Sabara 1900 explains this is done for showing respect to Bādarāyaṇa or for spreading his fame. Another explanation that ancient authors often refer to themselves in the 3rd person will not do. Why should the author of about 2700 gūtras choose five places only for referring to himself. Therefore, one is compelled to hold that, if Jaimini is the author of the extant PMS and mentions the views of Jaimidi five times only, there was a predecessor and namesake of his called Jamini who had expressed his views in a different work.</p>
<p>There are eleven sūtras in the VS in which the views of Jaimini are referred to. They are ( as stated above ) VS I. 2. 28 and 31, 1. 3. 31, I. 4. 18, III. 2. 40, III. 4. 2, III. 4. 18, III, 4. 40, IV. 3, 12, IV. 4, 5, IV, 4. 11. Out of these eleven there are six references to Jaimini (viz. I. 2. 28, 1. 2. 31, I. 4. 18, IV. 3 12, IV. 4. 5, IV. 4. 11) for which no corresponding adhikarana or sūtra in the PMS can be pointed out, while gūtras III. %. 40, III. 4. 2, III, 4. 18 attribute views to Jaimini, which are well known doctrines of the PMS. VS I. 3. 31 corresponds to PMS VI. 1. 5 and on III, 4. 40 (quoted in note 1890 above) Jaimini and VS agree. Therefore, it appears that the Jaimini who expresses views on purely Vedāntic topics and whose views are not found in PMS composed a work on Vedānta.</p>
<p>There are in VS nine sūtras in which Badarāyana is named viz. in VS I. 3, 26 and 33 (Bādarāyana being twice named in the same adhikarana as opposed to Jaimini), III, 2. 41, III. 4. 1, III. 4. 8, III. 4. 19, IV. 3. 15, IV, 4.7, IV, 4. 12. It may be noted that in all these cases (except in IV. 3. 15) the views asoribed to Bādarāyana are opposed to those of Jaimini or are slightly different (only VS IV. 4. 7 and IV. 4, 12). Prof. Nilakanta Sastri thinks that all the views mentioned as Badarāyana&rsquo;s are the viows of the author of the VS who employs</p>

<p>the third person for himself as anoient authors do (1. A, vol. 50 at p. 169). This does not afford a satisfactory explanation of the question why it was necessary to invoke Bādarāyana&rsquo;s namo in nine cages only for battressing up the position of the author of the V8 (that has 555 sūtras). If the author of the VS and Bādarāyaṇa named nine times are identical, the name of Bādarayapa should ordinarily appear towards the end of the adhikarana and not in the middle. Two examples may be cited here to illustrate how VS deals with references to Bādarayana. In III.2 38-41 (which is one adhikaranı) the siddhānta view is first stated with reasons in III, 2. 38-39, then Jaimini&rsquo;s view is oited (III. 4. 40) and then Bidarāyaṇa is mentioned as agreeing with the view first put forth &lsquo;pūryam tu Badarāyapo hetuvyapadeśāt), the difference being that the siddhānta is based upon &lsquo;upapatti&rsquo; while Bādarāyana relies upon &lsquo;hetuvyapadeśa&rsquo; (in sruti and smṛti). This shows that different reasons were assigned by the author of VS and by Bādarāyana for the same proposition. VS. III, 4.18-20 form one adhikarana about sannyāsa. Jaimini starts the pūrvapaksa that the Chan. Up. (II. 23.1 &lsquo;trayo dharmaskandhāh&rsquo;) only makes a passing reference to the āśramas, there is no vidhi ( injunction ) in that text and there is no exposition also. Then Bādarāyana&rsquo;s view is cited &lsquo;anuṣtheyam Bādarayanah samyaśruteh&rsquo; i. e. sannyāsa should be resorted to just as one resorts to the householder&rsquo;s stage. Then comes the view of the author of the V8 that there is a vidhi of sannyāsa in that text. If Bādarāyana and the author of V8 be held identical, why was it necessary to add the gūtara *vidhirvā dhāraṇavat&rsquo; (VS III. 4. 20) after stating Bādarāyana&rsquo;s piow? It would be also noticed that the reasons given in the two aātras differ. In VS IV, 4. 10-14 first the views of Bādari and Jaimini on Chān. Up. VIII, 2, 1, 5 are set out, then Bādara yapa&rsquo;s view is set forth (in IV, 4, 12) and then two more sūtras are added by the author of VS. Therefore, these illustrations show that, though the final conclusion of Bādarāyapa and the author of VS is the same, the language and the reasons are different, and that Bādarāyaṇa named in the VS was a predecessor of the author of the extant VS that had composed a work on Vedānta, whom the author of the VS strengthens with</p>
<p>Teasons of his own.</p>
<p>In Pāṇini&rsquo;s time there were mendioant ascetios (bhikṣus) who studied the &lsquo;Bhiksusūtra of Pārāśarya&rsquo; or &lsquo;the Bhikṣusātra</p>
<p>of Karmanda&rsquo; and were designated &ldquo;Pārāśarinah&rsquo; andBhik ṣusūtras of Pārāśarya and Karmanda</p>
<p>1169</p>
<p>• Karmandinah. 1901 A bhikṣu represents the order of Sannyāsa. Therefore, a Bhikṣusūtra must have had as its subject sannyāsa, the time for it, the rules of the order, the final goal to be attained and so on. The Bļ. Up. (III. 5.1 and IV. 4. 22) emphasizes that those who realize brahma give up all desires and practise begging. The Gautama-dharmabūtra 1902 says the same thing. No trace is found of the Bhikṣusūtra of Karmanda. But it is possible to say that the Bhikṣusūtra propounded by Pārāśarya must have been somewhat like the extant Brahmasūtra or one of its predecessors. This would be the earliest reference to &amp; sūtra by Pārāśarya on the sannyāsāśrama. The date of Panini is not beyond dispute. But no modern scholar would place him after 300 B.O. The present writer would place him as garly as at least 500 or 600 B. O. The result would be that the Bhikṣu sūtra of Pārāśarya named by Panini would have to be placed at some time between 400 B. C. to 700 B.C. Further light is shed by Vārtika 1903 (1) on Pāṇini IV, 1. 97, from which it follows that Vyasa&rsquo;s &lsquo;apatya&rsquo; (son) was called Vaiyāsaki, that is Suka (according to the Mahabhāṣya). Badarāyana is formed from Badara which is a word in the Nadadi-gana (consisting of about 76 words), according to Pāṇini IV. 1, 99 (Nadadibhyah phak), Badari being the son of Badara, Badarāyana being the grandson (or a remoter male descendant) of Badara. At some period Vyāsa and Badarāyana came to be confounded and Suka, who was the son of Vyāga according to the Vārtika and the Mahābhāṣya, came to be called Bādarāyaṇi (son of Badarayana) as shown by the Bhagavatapurāna (XII. 5. 8 where Suka is said to be &lsquo;Bhagavān Badarāyaṇiḥ&rsquo;). It appears that from the 9th century A. D. Bādarāyapa came to be confounded with Vyāsa Pārāśarya.</p>

<p>History of Dharmasāstra (880. VII, Oh. XXVIII</p>
<p>A brief examination of the citation of the views of Badar. yapa and Jaimini in the PMS and the Brahmasūtra 1904 is necessary. Badarāyana is named only five times by the P. M. sutra as said above. (1) In P. M. S. I. 1.5 the author claims that he and Bādarāyana are agreed on the eternity and infalli bility of the Veda; (2) In P. M. S. V. 2. 17-20, there is a discussion on Nakṣatresti. In the model sacrifice there are certain homas called Nāristha; the question is whether in the modifioations of the model wherein certain subordinate homas colled upahomas are prescribed, the Nāriṣtha homas precede or follow the Upahomag. The sindhūnta view is that Nāriṣthahomas precede, Ātreya being of the opposite view and Bādarāyana supporting the siddhānta. (3) In P. M. 8. VI. 1. 8 Bādarāyana&rsquo;s view is that not men alone but women also are entitled to take part in kratus (Vedic sacrifices) and this is the siddhānta of the P.M. S.; (4) P. M. S. X. 8. 35-46 make an extensive arthikaranır in which the question is whether the texts prescribing Āgnoya and Aindrāgna purodāśus in Darśapūrṇamāsa for a sacrificer who has not performed soma sacrifice constitute a vidhi (of the two) or only an anuvāda, Bādarāyaṇa&rsquo;s view in PMS. X. 8. 44 being that its is a vidhi and the siddhūnta being that there is an anuvāda (X. 8. 45). (5) PMS XI. 1. 54-67 constitute a lengthy adhikarana and the discussion concerns the question whether āghāra and other angas are to be repeated with each of the principal matters (Āgneya and others) in Darsapūrṇamāsa or are to be performed only once.</p>
<p>With regard to these five cases where Badarāyana is cited in the P. M. S. three points emerge, viz. the author of the P.M.S. agrees with Badarāyaṇa&rsquo;s view in all except in X. 8. 44 (whore the two differ), that the view attributed to Bādarāyana in P.M. S. I 1.5 has correspondence with the views of the V.8. (1. 3. 28-29) and that four views out of five refer to purely sacrificial matters to which nothing corresponds in the V. S. It follows that the author of the extant P. M. S. had some work of Bādarāyana dealing with Pūrvamlmāmgā matters before him and that, if Bādarāyana be the author of the extant V.S., the latter had composed a work on Pūrvamimāṁsā matters also or that there was another Bādarāyaṇa who wrote only on Pūrya</p>
<ol start="1904">
<li>Prof. Nilakant Sastry&rsquo;s paper referred to above is valuable, but several of his conclusions set out on p. 172 of I. A. vol. 50 cannot be accepted by the present writer, who regrets that Prof. Sastry did not consider much other matter relevant to the points discussed by him.</li>
</ol>
<p>jaimini and Badarāyana</p>

<p>mimāmsā. The five references to Jaimini in P. M. S. have been noted above and the sūtra VI. 3. 4, which led Prof. Sastry to postulate three Jaiminis, has been already explained as not necessarily leading to any such conclusion.</p>
<p>Another alternative might be put forward viz. that works by Jaimini and Bādarāyana did not exist before the extant V. S. and P. M. S., but that the references to Jaimini and Bādarāyaṇa concern views current in the schools of Jaimini and Bādarāyana. But this is not a likely hypothesis. The extant V. S. and P. M. S. are meant for all throughout Aryāvarta and it is not likely that the oral traditions of two schools were supposed to be known to all and sundry in the whole of the country.</p>
<p>In several cases where Bādarāyana is mentioned, the extant V. 8. makes certain additions and explanations. It has been shown above that Saṅkarācārya, Bhāskara and Yamuna ascribe the V. S. to Bādarāyaṇa and that Vācaspati and others hold that Vyāsa Pārāśarya is the author of V. S. It is difficult to explain how Vedavyāsa came to be identified with Bādarāyana after the 9th century A. D. Some other relevant matters have also to be considered. A verse about kṣeira and kṣetrajna in the Bhagavadgitā raises a problem. In Gitā 1905 13. 4 it is said this</p>
<ol start="1905">
<li>Frathugur fri returrat que la serata dagarnardt a sita 13. 4; the first half refers to the passages in the Vedas and Upaniṣads and the 2nd half to the Brahmasūtrapadas. E acasa must be connected with gitam according to all commentators. The present writer feels that the word &lsquo;qṣibhiḥ&rsquo; also most be understood in the second half of the verse. It īsibhiḥ is required to be connected with .cbandobbiḥ&rsquo;, there is no reason why tbat word should not be connected with &lsquo;Brahmasūtrapadalı&rsquo; also. Two words io the instrumental are employed in the first half (viz. ssibbik (agents) and &lsquo;chandobbih&rsquo; (means); if we uoderstand &lsquo;psibhiḥ&rsquo; in tho 2nd half, we shall have a symmetrical arrangement viz. &lsquo;raibhih&rsquo; (agents) and &lsquo;Brabmasūtrapadaih&rsquo; (means). There is a contrast between Vedic and Upadiṣadic passages in the first half and Brabmasūtra passages that are well reasoned and definite in the 2nd half. Then the morning will be that sages had composed several Brabmasūtrag. The author is inclined to hold that the Gitā refers to several Brabmasūtras current in its day and not to the extant Vedāntasūtra, Hore commentators other than Saṅkarācārya understand by the word &ldquo;Brahmasūtra&rsquo; the work going under that name in these days. The late Lokamānya Tilak in his Marathi &ldquo;Gitārabasya&rsquo; die ousses (io appendix part 3 PP. 527-534 of the ed, of 1915) the question of the relation of the Gith and Brabmasūtra and pats forward his own surmiae</li>

<p>(Continued on next page)</p>
<p>1172</p>
<p>History of Dharmatastra [ Sec. VII, Ch. XXVIII</p>
<p>real nature of kṣetra and kṣetrajña has been separately sung (i. o. propounded) in many ways by the sages in different vedio hymns (or metros) and by the words of the Brahmasutra that are full of reasoning and that arrive at definite conclusions&rsquo;. Here the Gita expressly mentions Brahmasūtra. If one turng to the extant Brahmasutra (or Vedāntasūtra), it is found that in many sūtras reliance is placed on smṛti, which is taken to mean the Gita by all acāryas. For example, on &lsquo;Surtisca&rsquo; (V.S. I 2. 6) the only Smasti passages cited by Saṅkarācārya are Gitā 18. 61 and 13.2. Similarly, on &lsquo;api ca smaryate&rsquo; (V. 8. I 3.23) Saṅkara cites only Gitā 15. 6 and 12; on &lsquo;api ca smaryate&rsquo; (V. S. II. 3. 45) the only Smrti passage quoted by Saṅkara is Gitā 15. 7; on &lsquo;Smaranti ca&rsquo; (V, S. IV. I. 10) only Gita 6.11 is quoted; on &lsquo;Yoginaḥ prati ca smaryate smārte caite&rsquo; (V. S. IV. 2. 21) Gitā 8. 24-25 alone are set forth as the passages meant to be explained. Therefore, though the Bhagavad. gitā is not expressly named in the Brahmasūtra, the ācāryas are agreed that the Bhagavadgita alone is relied upon and referred to in all the above-mentioned sūtras. We have, therefore reached this position that the Gita mentions the Brabmasutra which must be held to be earlier than the Gita, but as Gita passages are declared to be at the basis of some of the Vedanta gūtras, the Gitā must be earlier than the V. S. This is contradi ctory; Saṅkarācārya, 1906 who saw the contradiction, therefore explained &lsquo;Brahmasūtrapadaiḥ&rsquo;as passages (of Upaniṣads) that suggest (i. e. propound) doctrines about brahma (i. e. he interprets sūtra&rsquo; as meaning &lsquo;sūcaka&rsquo;). But this explanation is far-fetched and has not been accepted by other commentators. Therefore, other theories have to be put forward viz. that the author of both is the same or that the Mahabharata and Gita were receiving accretions from time to time and that when the</p>
<p>(Continued from last page) that the author who composed the extant Brahmasūtra redacted the original Mabābbārata and Gitā and gave them both the present form. The present writer regrets that he cannot accept this surmise of the late Lokamānya. It may be pointed out that Prof. R. D. Karmarkar io (ABORI vol. III. PP. 73 79) did not accept Lokamānya&rsquo;s explanation of Brabmasūtrapadaih&rsquo; and beld that is Gitā 13. 4 the word &lsquo;Brabmasūtrapadaiṇ&rsquo; does not refer to the Bādarāyaṇa sūtras but refers to some similar other works. But he did pot pursue that matter further.</p>

<p>final redaction of the Mahabharata (including the Gitā) was made the verse about Brahmasūtra was inserted in the Gitā or that in the times of the Gitā there were several works called Brahmasūtra other than the extant one,</p>
<p>The present writer thinks it highly probable that the Gitā had before it several works called Brahmasūtras and in 13, 4 refers to them and not to the extant Brahmasūtra of Bādarāyaṇa. A brief examination of the authors mentioned in the PMS and VS is necessary. Both these works mention by name several individual authors (besides Jaimini and Bādarāyaṇa). Both PMS and vs mention the following:</p>
<p>Atreya - PMS IV. 3. 18, V. 2. 18, VI. 1,26 and VS III, 4, 44; Asmarathya-PMS VI. 5. 16 and VS I. 2. 29, I. 4. 20; Karṣnājini – PMS IV, 3. 17, VI, 7. 35 and VS III, 1. 9. Badari - PMS III. 1. 3, VI. 1. 27, VIII, 3. 6, IX. 2. 33 and VS. I.</p>
<p>2.30, 11. 1. 11, IV, 3.7, IV. 4. 10; PMS also names Alekhana (VI. 5. 17), Aitiśāyana (III. 2. 44, III. 4. 24, VI. 1. 6), Kāmukāyana (XI. 1.58 and 63) and Lāyu kāyana (VI. 7. 37), these being not mentioned at all in the V8. On the other hand VS mentions Audulomi (I. 4. 21, III, 4. 45, IV.4.6) and Kāśakrtana (I, 4,22), both being absent from PMS. The PMS very rarely refers to some ācāryag as eko&rsquo; in I. 1.27 and IX. 3.4; V. S. has &lsquo;eke&rsquo; in I. 4. 9 and 18, II. 3. 43, TIT. 2. %. and 13, III. 4. 15, IV. 2. 13 and &lsquo;ekoṣām&rsquo; in I. 4.13, IV. 1. 17, IV. 2. 13 and &lsquo;anye&rsquo; in III, 3. 27, in all of which the reference in V.S. is to other recensions of the Veda or Upanisads, while in III, 4. 42.eke' refers to acāryāḥ and in III. 3. 53 &lsquo;eke&rsquo; refers to Lokāyatikas. Vyāsa or Pārāśarya is not mentioned by name in PMS or VS. The case of Badari requires careful considera tion. The PMS mentions both Badarāyana and Jaimini only five times each, while PMS and V8 mention (each) Badari four times. Badari differs from Jaimini on two important points viz. the denotation of the word seṣa' and the remarkable view that even sūdras are entitled to perform agnihotra and other Vedic rites. In Vs. Bādari is mentioned as differing from Jaimini on the upāsanā of Vaiāvānara in Chan, Up. V. 18. 1-2 and on the words &lsquo;sa enān brahma gamayati&rsquo; (Ohān. Up. IV. 15.5) and in V8 IV. 4. 10 Badari is opposed to Jaimini about a released soul. It follows from this brief analysis and the mention of Bādari four times in PMS and also in VS that both the latter had before them a work of Bādari dealing with Purva</p>
<p>1174</p>
<p>History of Dharmafāstra ( Sec. VII, Ch. XXVIII</p>
<p>mlmārgā matters and also with Vedānta, Alekhana and Asma rathya are both quoted at least 16 times in Ap. Sr. Sūtra, their views are quoted frequently as in confliot on the ritual of sacrifices and these are the only two individual authors quoted in Āp. Sr. 8. It is likely that Atreya, Asmarathya and Kārsṇājini composed &amp; work or works dealing with both systems and Audulomi (quoted thrice by VS) and Kāśakrtsna composed works on the Vedanta. Vide Tantrayārtika on I 3.2 p. 169 note 2010 for the view that the present PMS was preceded by several efforts in the same direction.</p>
<p>From the above discussion it may very plausibly be held that the word &lsquo;Brahmasūtrapadaih&rsquo; in Gitā 13. 4 refers to some sūtra works such as those of Bādari, Audulomi, Āśmarathya and one or two others and not to the extant Brabmasūtra. No one can say that Badari and Atreya are not ļsis'. Sabara refers to Ātroya as &lsquo;Muni&rsquo; on PMS VI. I. 26.</p>
<p>It should be remembered that Jaimini, Bādari and Badarā. yana are gotra names. But Vyāsa is not a gotra Dame and Pārāsarya is one of the three prararas of the group of Parāśaras. 1907</p>
<p>The Ap. Śr. Sūtra 24. 8. 10 (ed. by Garbe) and the Pravara mañjari (ed. by Chentsalrav, Mysore, 1900) p. 61 mention Bādarāyaṇa as a sub-section of Viṣṇuy;ddhagotra, while p. 38 of the latter work mentions Jaimini along with Yāska, Vādhūla, Mauna and others as having the pravara &lsquo;Bhargava-vaitabavya gāvataseti&rsquo; and pp. 108 and 178 cite Bādari (or Vadari) as a sub-division of Parāśaras. Therefore, it was possible that several individuals separated by a century or more could bear the bamo of Jaimini or Bādarāyapa.</p>
<p>We have also to answer the observations of the Naiskarmya siddhi of Sureśvarācārya (the most famous of the disciples of Saṅkarācārya himself) that Jaimini does not mean that all passages of the Veda relate to sacrificial rites and that if he really meant that, he would not have composed &lsquo;Sārirakasūtra&rsquo; beginning with &lsquo;athāto brahma-jijñāsā&rsquo; and &lsquo;janmadyasya yataḥ&rsquo;, containing an investigation of the purport of all Vedanta passages, laying bare the nature of brahma and supporting his words with profound reasoning; but that as a matter of fact he</p>

This passage means that Jaimini composed a sūtra work called Sarirakasūtra on the investigation and knowledge of brahma, which began with two sūtras that were the same as the first two sūtras of the extant Vedāntasūtra 1908 Col. Jacob in his Introduction (p. 3) to the first edition of the Naiskarmyasiddhi thought that the Naiskar myasiddhi made Jaimini the author of the Vedāntadarsana. He is inaccurate, since all that Sureśvara says is that Jaimini composed not only a sūtra work on the Karmamimāmā but he also composed a work called Sarirakasūtra on the doctrines of brahmamsmāmsā, but he does not convey that the whole of the extant Vedāntasūtra is the work of Jaimini. Dr. Belvalkar 1909 postulates two propositions, viz. that there were brahmagūtras written separately for the Chāndogya Upaniṣad and the Bṛbad āraṇyaka-Upaniṣad and other Upadiṣads for each Sākhā and secondly, that the Sārirakasūtra of Jaimini wag bodily incorpo rated within and forms the main part of the contents of the present text of the Brahmasūtra. The present author takes strong objections to both these propositions, He cannot go into this question at length here but has to remark that these propositions are based on little evidence. If &lsquo;janmadyasya yatah&rsquo; was also &amp; sūtra of Jaimini who was specially connected with the Sama veda by the Mahābhārata and Purāṇas, why is it that that sūtra is supposed by the bhāṣyakāras as based on a passage of the Taittirlya-upaniṣad? The Chandogya and Bphadāraṇyaka Upa niṣads are each Dearly thrice as long as all the other sight Upan niṣads (out of the principal ton Upaniṣads) and six times longer than the Taittiriya Upanisad. Therefore, these two Upaniṣads figure largely in the discussions in the extant Brahmagūtra. The 2nd proposition is hardly more than a pure guess. There is no evidence to establish that the main part of the extant Vedānta sūtra is bodily taken from Jaimini&rsquo;s Sārīrakasūtra, when the latter has not come down to us and when no sūtras therefrom</p>

<p>Then some sūtras of VS in which the words &lsquo;tad-uktam. 1910 ocour have to be considered. There are eight sutras that contain those words. Saṅkarācārya holds that in VS I. 3. 21, II, 1. 31, III. 3. 18 (where &lsquo;tad uktam&rsquo; occur) the reference is to the preceding sūtras of the VS itself. On V. S. III. 3. 26, III. 3. 33, III. 3.50 and III, 4. 42 Saṅkarācārya holds that these respectively refer to PMS X. 8.15, III. 3. 8, XI. 4. 10 and I. 3. 8-9 and that VS III. 3. 43 refers to a sūtra of the Saṅkarsakānda. The other acāryas differ from Saökarācārya in several places and among themselves. Vallabhācārya, who had come to regard the Bhāgem vata as of equal authority with the Veda and as even supersed ing the latter, holds that the words &lsquo;tad-uktam&rsquo;in VS ILI. 3. 33, HII. 3. 50 and III, 4. 42. refer to passages of the Bhagavatapurāṇa. The VS III. 3. 41 appears to echo the words and principles of PMS ILI. 3. 14.M11 The words &lsquo;tad-uktam&rsquo; should ordinarily mean the same thing throughout i, e. they should everywhere bo takon as referring to the PMS or to Vs. But no ācārya is prepared to accept entirely one of these two alternatives. It may further be noted that the extant P. M. S. very rarely employs the words &lsquo;tad-uktam&rsquo; as in V. 3. 9 where it refers to PMS V. I. 19.1912 The P. M. S., though it mentions Bādarayana five times, nowhere appears to be influenced by the V.8. On the other hand, not only are some of the sūtras of V. S. contain ing the words Tad-uktam&rsquo; deemed to be references to the P, M. Sūtras, but the V.8 frequently employs peculiar Pūryamimānsā words such as arthavāda, prakarana, linga, vidhi, śeṣa and purely P. M. matters such as in III. 3. 26 (kuśāchandastutyupa gānayat), III. 3. 33 ( anpasadavat), III. 4. 20 (dhāranavat), IV. 4. 12 (Dvādaśābavat). Therefore, the extant VS very much presupposes the P. M. 8., while the latter cannot be said to have been influenced by VS to any noticeable extent.</p>

<p>Conclusions about Jaimini, Vyāsa and Bādarāyana</p>

<p>Badarāyana, the PMS and the V8 and tries to present a tenta. tive pattern of conclusions as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The Mahabharata and some Purāṇas state that Jaimini was a pupil of Pārāśarya Vyāsa. But this is said in relation to the transmission of the Samayeda to Jaimini and therefore must be confined to that matter alone (and not extended to other matters) in aocordance with the mināmsā maxim yāyad vacadam vācanikam.&rsquo; We have got a Jaiminiya Brāhmaṇa, a Jaiminlya Srauta-sūtra and Ghya-sūtra. The tradition about the imparting of Samaveda to Jaimini may be true and at present there is no evidence to show that it is wrong. There is, however, no warrant for extending this tradition to the reputed authors of the PMS and the Vs. Lato medieval writers like Vallabhācārya, whose weakest points were lack of correot know ledge of history and chronology and the obsession to glorify to the skies their favourite authors and works, extended the above tradition about the Sāmaveda to the authors of the two sātra works,1913 viz. PMS and VS. From the above discussion it follows that the extant PMS is earlier than the extant VS and that the author of the extant PMS could not have been a disciple of the author of the extant VS. The medieval writers failed to pay proper attention to the fact that Jaimini and Badarāyana are also gotre names and not merely individual names.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From Pāṇini we know that there were two bhikṣu-sutras composed by Pārāśarya and Karmanda before his time. Patan jali mentions a mimāsaā work composed by Kāśakṣtana. There is, therefore, no doubt that sūtra works on &lsquo;bhikṣus and mimāṁsā had come to be composed several conturies before the</p>

<p>Christian era.</p>

<li>
<p>From the examination of the views of Jaimini mentioned in the extant VS it appears that Jaimini composed a work on Vedānta also. Some corroboration is lent to this view by the romarks of the Naiṣkaramyasiddhi quoted on p. 1175 above. There is nothing to show that this Jaimini was a pupil of Bādarayana or of Pārāśarya. On the contrary, the words &lsquo;Jaiminer-api&rsquo; in VS. III. 4. 40 convey great solicitude on the part of the author of the extant VS for Jaimini&rsquo;s support. The author of the</p>

<p>History of Dharmasastra [ Sec. VII, Ch. XXVII</p>
<p>extant VS shows special respect for Jaimini&rsquo;s views, since he quotes Jaimini more times than other ācāryas (including Badarāyaṇa). It becomes necesgary to hold that there were two authors named Jaimini, one dealing with both PM and Vedānta subjects and the other deemed to be the author of the extant PMS. This Jaimini is different from Jaimini deemed to be the author of the extant PMS.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<p>The fact that PMS mentions five times Bādarayana&rsquo;s views, four of which are concerned with purely sacrificial matters and the fact that the VS mentions Badarāyana nine times in conneotion with Vedānta matters, leads to the inference that Badarāyaṇa must have composed a work dealing with PM and Vedanta topics. That work has not come down to us. This Bādarāyaṇa is different from the Bādarāyaṇa regarded by Saṅkarācārya and others as the author of the extant VS. Thus there are two authors namod Badarāyana.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The author of the extant VS was, according to Saṅkara cārya, Bhāskara and some other early bhāsyakāras, also Badarāyaṇa, but from about the 9th contury A. D. onwards he came to be confounded with Vedavyasa.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So far as the PMS and VS are concorned, there are only two Jaiminis (and not three, as Prof. Sastry holds in I. A, vol. 50 p. 172) and two Bādarāyaṇas.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The present section is concerned mainly with the influence of Pārvamlmāmsā doctrines and methodology on Dharmaśāstra works. But it must be mentioned here that Pūrvamimārngā works from that of Jaimini onwards also rely upon smrtis and Dharmaśāstra. A few examples may be cited. The PMS I, 3 deals with the limits of the authoritativeness of smstis, PMS VI. 7.6 montions the word &lsquo;Dharmaśāstra&rsquo; The P. M. S. expressly relies on smrti in support of its propositions (as in XII. 4. 43). On PMS VI. 1. 12 Sabara quotes a smrti verso, which is almost the same as Manu VIII. 416 and Adiparva (82.23=Cr. Ed. 77.22). Sabara frequently quotes Dharmasūtras and metrical smitis to elucidate and strengthen his arguments; 0.g. Sabara on PMS VI. I. 10 quotes Ap. Dh. S. II. 6. 13. 11 and states on PMS VI. I. 15 that the sale of a daughter montioned in the smṛtis is not approved of by śistas. 1914 It is not necessary to cite further</p>

<p>We must now turn to the Pūrvamimārgāgūtra itself. In relation to every śāstra there are what are called four anubandhas (indispensable elements) 1915 viz. Visaya (the subject to be treated of), prayojana (the purpose or object), sambandha (the relation of the śāstra to the prayojana) and adhikarin ( the person entitled or competent to study the sastra). The Slokavartika 1916 remarks &lsquo;as long as the purpose of any sāstra or of any under taking (or act) whatever is not declared, so long no one will take it (i. e. study or do it).&rsquo; Therefore, the very first sutra of the PMS puts forward the subject ( viṣaya) and the purpose of the śāstra (prayojana). 1917 That sūtra states &lsquo;next, therefore, (should be undertaken) the investigation and consideration of dharma&rsquo;. The sambandha of this sāstra with the prayojana is that of sādhya (the object to be attained) and sadhana (the means of attaining) i. e, this śāstra is the means of attaining the knowledge of dharma. Therefore, as remarked by the Sastra.</p>

<p>dipikā (on P. M. S. II. 1. 1), the proper subject of this sāstra is Dharma and not the meaning of the Veda (tasmad dharma ityøya sāstraviṣayo na vedārtha iti). The adhikārin is one who has studied the Veda or a part of it from a guru and is treated of at length in the 6th chapter of the P. M. S.</p>
<p>The Mimāmgāgūtra does not state how much of the Voda has to be studied before one enters on understanding the mean ing of it. Here the Smṛtis come to one&rsquo;s help. Gautama II. 51-53 prescribes several options viz. twelve years for one Veda or 12 years for each of the four vedas or so long as he can commit to memory (one Veda). Manu IlI. 1-2 are similar viz. one should study vedas for 36 years under a guru or for 18 years or nine years or for as many years as would be required for committing Veda to memory and they permit the option of studying the three Vodas or two Vedas or ons Veda. Yaj. I. 36 remarks that Vedic studenthood lasts 12 years for each Veda or five (for each Voda) or gome sages say for as many years as the student would require to master (one Veda or more). But even these prescriptions must have been rather a tall order for many brābmapas, ksatriyas and vaisyas. Further, the Mimāmsā requires that not only should a person of the three varnas ( classes ) study the Voda but he must also engage in understand ing its meaning. On PMS I. 1.1 Sabara states that the vener able Yājõikas do not 1918 declare that rowards result from the mere study (momorizing) of the Veda and that where the Vedic texts appear to assign a reward for the mere memorizing of Veda they are merely arthavādas (intended only to praise Veda study ). as in Tai. Ār. II.15 which states1919&rsquo;whatever (vedic texts about a), sacrifice he memorizes the result is that be, as it were actually performs that, and he secures absorption into (or communion with) Agni, Vāgu, Sūrya. The Tai. Up. I. 9 attaches the greatest importance to svādhyāya (memorizing the Veda) and pravacana (teaching it or expounding it) and after stating the views of two sagas cites the view of Naka Maudgalya that svādhyāya and pravacana are the most important to be resorted to or striven for, though sta, satya, dama, sama, agnihotra, hospitality and others may be combined with them, the reason</p>

<p>How much of the Veda to be studied</p>

<p>being that those two constituto tapas. The PMS in IIL 8. 18 (jñāte ca vācanam na hy-avidyān vihitossti) provides that only he who knows the Veda has adhikāra for performing sacrifices. Śabara 1920 raises the question how much of the Veda must a man know in order to be entitled to perform a vedic sacrifice and replies that he must have memorized as much of the yeda as would enable him to carry to its completion the vedic sacrifice undertaken by him, The Tantravārtika on the same sutra adds that the whole veda is to be studied during the period of studenthood, but if anyone is unable to memorize the whole veda, but somehow only the portion on Agnihotra and Darsa pūrṇamāsa, then it cannot be said that he has no adhikāra for performing those two. To memorize the Veda and also to study its meaning was a formidable task. Many verses of the Veda had a threefold application with reference to sacrifices ( adhi yajña), with reference to the deities (adhidaivata or adhidaiva) and adhyatma (with reference to the spiritual or metaphysical meaning ). Vide Nir. III. 12 ( where Rg. I. 164, 21 is explained in two ways, adhidaivata and adhyātma ), X. 26 (where Rg. X. 82.2 is explained in two ways, adhidaivata and adhyātma), XI. 4 ( where Rg. X 85. 3 is explained in adhiyajña and adhidaivata ways), XII. 37 (where Vāj. 8. 34. 55 is explained in the adhi daivata and adhyātma ways ), XII. 38 ( where Atharva X. 8.9 is explained in adhidaivata and adhyātma ways). Manu ( VL. 83 ) lays down the jape (muttering) of Veda of the adhiyajña, adhidaivika and adhyatmika types. Manu I. 23 and Vedānga. jyotiṣa say that the mantras of the three vedas were drawn from Agni, Vāyu and Sūrya for the carrying out of yajñas. Vibya rūpa on Yāj. I. 51 1921 explains the words &lsquo;vedam pratāni vā pāram nitvā&rsquo; as memorizing the Veda and completely under standing its meaning and not morely memorizing it. Dakṣa says that Vedābhyāsa (study of the Veda) comprehends&rsquo;five 1992</p>

<p>Having declared in the first sūtra that after a person has studied the Veda and because he has done so, PMS proceeds to say that he should start on the consideration of what dharma 1928 is. The 2nd sūtra, therefore, defines &ldquo;dharma as an act conducive to a man&rsquo;s highest good, that is chara cterized by an exhortative (vedic) text.&rsquo; Sabara explains that *codanā&rsquo; means a sentence that urges or exhorts a person to do an act. So this conveys that the means of knowledge (pramāṇa) as regards dharma are vedio sentences and it also means that what is characterized or indicated by codanā is dharma i.e. the nature (svarupa) of Dharma is made manifest. The word &lsquo;artha&rsquo; is put in to exclude acts (from being design ated dharma) that may be mentioned in the veda but the result of doing which is evil, such as the sentence &lsquo;one practising black magic (to harm a person ) may perform the Syena sacrifice.&rsquo; This is not dharma, but adharma, since the practice of black magic is condemned as sinful. This vedic sentence does not say that one should inflict injury, it only says that syenayaga brings about injury and if one desires to inflict injury, śyena is the means. 1929 The Slokavartika remarks that the words, &lsquo;codana.&rsquo;, &lsquo;upadesa&rsquo; and &lsquo;vidhi&rsquo; are synonyms according to</p>

<p>History of Dharmaśāstra ( Seo. VII, Oh. XXVIII</p>
<p>Śabāra, the bhāsyakāra. The word &lsquo;vidhi&rsquo; is ofton translated as injunction (i. e. an authoritative order) but in common parlance ' injunction&rsquo; means &lsquo;restraining a person from doing something.&rsquo; Therefore, the word, &lsquo;codanā&rsquo; or &lsquo;vidhi&rsquo; has often been trans. lated in these pages as &lsquo;exhortatory passage or exhortation.&rsquo; The result is that dharma means a religious act (a yāga) which confers bighest good. In Rg. X. 90. 16&rsquo;yajña&rsquo; is spoken of as the first (or arcient) dharma (yajñena yajñam-ayajanta devis tāni dharmāṇi prathamāpyāsan) and Sabara (in the bhāsya on P. M.S. I. 1.2) quotes this verse for the proposition that the Veda expressly says that dharma means &lsquo;yāga&rsquo;. That Vedas have been promulgated for yajña is stated by the Vedānga jyotisa 1930 verse 3 (Vodā hi yajñārthamabhipravșttāh). Medi. eval Dharmasastra writers like the Mitaksara (on Yaj. II. 135), Dayatattva (p. 172), Vy. M. (p. 157) quote a verse ascribed to Dovala or Kātyayana, which provides that all wealth is created for sacrifices, that, therefore, one should expend it on purposes of dharma and not on women, fools and irreligious people inst (vide H. of Dh. Vol. III. p.609 n. 1155 for further passages of similar import and their application).</p>
<p>Sabara introduces the 2nd sūtra by saying that what is to be investigated and understood is what dharma is (i.e. what is ils nature-svarupa), what are its characteristics, what are the means of attaining it, what are deceptive (wrong) means of attaining it and what does it lead to (what the fruit or reward of knowing it is ) and replies that the second sūtra explains the first two of these (viz. what dharma is and what its characteristics are 1933 ).</p>

<p>What is the special province of Mimārsū</p>
<p>1185</p>
<p>That is, &lsquo;codanās&rsquo; ( vedio hortatory texts) are the pramāṇa (means of knowledge) about dharma and whatever is laid down by hortatory vedic texts is dharma (i. 6. Dharmasyarūpa). The relation of Dharma to the Veda and the Pūrvamīmāṁsā-śāstra is clearly and succinctly brought out in a verse of Kumarila himself as follows: 1933 &quot; When discussion about the correct knowledge of Dharma is being carried on, Veda being the means of such knowledge, mimāṁsā will supply complete information about the subject of the procedure or method.&rsquo; Just as even if a man has good sight be cannot perceive anything unless there is light, 80 unless a man knows the methods laid down by PMS he cannot correctly judge what Dharma is. Jaimini thon exam mines the means of knowledge (pramāpas) and holds that except sabda (i. e. the Veda) there is no means of knowledge about Dharma. One cannot perceive directly what Dharma is i. e, Dharma is not pratyakṣa. All the other pramānas except sabda are based on pratyakṣa and therefore they cannot define or explain what Dharma is. According to Kumārila there are six pramāṇas, pratyaksa (direct perception), anumāna (inference), upamāna (analogy), sabda, arthāpatti and abhāya (non-exis tence). Prabhākara does not accept the last as a pramāṇa.</p>
<p>The subjects of the twelve chapters of the PMS are stated in the J. N.M.V. to be respectively: (1st chapter) pramāna (means of knowledge; (2nd) bheda (six grounds on whioh religious rites are distinguished from each other and the distinctions of rites as principal and subsidiary); (3) Sosa (the meaning of seṣa boing &lsquo;ancillary or what subserves another that is called seṣin or what is helpful to another&rsquo;), how it is employed and the relative strength of śruti, linga, vākya, prakarana, sthāna and samākhyā;(4) prayukti (what is obligatory and what is addressed to the performor&rsquo;s consol ence i. . what is kratvartha and what is puruṣārtha); (5) Krama (principles of settling the order or sequence depending on śruti &amp;c.); (6) adhikāra (persong entitled to perform yāga ); (7) sama nyātideśa ( extension of items in the model yāga to its modifica. tions);(8) Viśeṣātidesa (extension of items to individual rites); (9) ūha (adaptation of mantras and samskāras ); (10) badha</p>

In the four pādas of the first adhyāya four matters are respectively dealt with viz. vidhi (hortatory texts ), arthavada (laudatory or explanatory passages including mantras ), smrtis (including customs and usages) and names ( of rites, such as udbhid, citrā). Sabara himself gives a summary 1934 of the first chapter of PMS as follows; viz, the pramāṇas; principles of the conclusions about vidhi, arthuvada, mantra and smrtis, examina. tion of guṇavidbi ( texts laying down some subsidiary or acoes sory matter as in &lsquo;dadhna juhoti&rsquo;, where curds are prescribed as offering) and nāmadheya; the deterinination of doubtful matters by the help of the remainder of a passage or by the sāmarthya (the suitability of things for the actions prescribed ).

Sabara quotes many verses concerning PMS matters and a few also on other topics. Verses quoted on PMS matters are found on II. 1. 32 (one on p. 434 and another on p. 435), II. 1. 33 (P. 436, two verses ), 1936 II. 2 1 (p. 462, two versos on adrstārtha), on IV.3.3 (one verse on p. 1247), IV. 4. 21 (p. 1279 a verse on piṇdapitȚyajña), IV. 4. 24 (p. 1280 an Aryā verse on the girdle of sacrificial post), IV. 4. 28 (p. 1281 about &lsquo;svaru&rsquo;), V. 2. 23 (p. 1319, same verge on XII. 2. 30 p. 2251), VII. 1. 12 (p. 1534 definition of atideśa), X. 4. 20 (p. 1924 one verse ), XI. 1.1 (p. 2096 on tantra and prasanga), XII. 3. 20 (P. 2262 on bhāsika-svara). All these verses are apparently quoted by Sabara from some work or commentary on the PMS or on Pūrvamimāmsā, one or two probably from some Srautasātra and one or two may be his own composition.</p>
<p>Many glosses on PMS composed by writers of the 10th and following centuries are extant, of which 22 are referred to on p. 166 of vol. VI. of the Sarasyatibhavana Studies (Benares) by M. M.

<p>clearly indicated by the Slokavārtika that says that the very first sentence 1937 of Sabara&rsquo;s bhāsya was interpreted in six different ways before it by commentators and by the Tantrayārtika that the bhāsyakāra did not notice six sūtras after the &lsquo;nivitādhi karana&rsquo;(III. 4.1-9) and that commentators differed in their reasons for the omission, but all commentators other than Sabara did explain those six sūtras. 1938 None of the commentaries composed before Kumārila is now available.</p>
<p>Kumārila wrote the slokavārtika on Sabara&rsquo;s blāsya on P.M.S. I, 1 (in about 4000 verses) and the voluminous Tantra vārtika on I. 2 to the end of chap. III of PMS and the Tup-tikā on P. M. S. IV-XII (stray notes, not a regular commentary ). Kumārila is credited with having composed two more com mentaries, &lsquo;Madhyama-ṭiki&rsquo; and &lsquo;Brhat tikā&rsquo; on P. M S. 1939 The latter has been referred to by the Nyāyaratnakara 1940 and the Nyāyasudhā on Tantravārtika quotes several verses from it (on pp. 201, 329-30, 393) and the Jaiminiya-sūtrarthasangraha of Rsiputra Parameśvara quotes Brhat-tikā several times.

<p>Pupṭika 1941 has some regular commentaries but none is published. The Tantraratna of Pārthasārathimiśra deals at some length with the same chapters of P. M. 8. (published partly in Prince of Wales, Sarasvatibhavana 8.). On Sabara&rsquo;s bhāṣya Prabhākara wrote a commentary called Bṛhati, a portion of which on the Tarkapāda (PMS I. 1) with the commentary Rjuvimalāpañoikā of Salikanāthamiśra has been edited by Pandit 8. K, Ramanatha Sastri and published by the Madras University (1934). The Sastra-dipikā of Pārthasārathi is not a regular commentary on the P. M. S. but it is a classic work on the P. M. S. and follows the views of Kumārila. Another very useful work is the Jaiminiya-nyāya-mālā-vistāra 1942 of Mādbavācārya (published by Anan. Press, Poona) that gives summaries in verse of the adhikaranas of the PMS with brief prose comments and also points out some of the differences of Prabhākara (called &lsquo;guru&rsquo; by Sālikanātha and others) from Kumārila (in all about 15 points of difference being noted between the two de regards the first chapter of the PMS and three in the 2nd chapter). Śalika nātha wrote an independent work called Prakaraṇapancikā (published in the Chowkhamba 8.8.). There is another work of Prabhākara&rsquo;s school called Nayaviveka of Bhavanātha or Bhava deva ( ed. by Pandit 8. K. Ramanath Sastri and published by the Madras University in 1937). This Bhavanātha is eulogised in the Madanaratnapradīpa on Vyavahāra (pp. 324-325, published by the Anup S. Library, Bikaner, 1948) as the sun to the lotus of Prabhākara&rsquo;s doctrine. The Tantrarahasya of Rāmāpujācārya (2nd ed. published in G O. 8, 1956) composed about 1750 A. D. is the last noted work of the Prābhākara School and this work furnishes some useful information about the works of Prabhākara and the commentaries thereon by Sālikanātha.

<p>Prabhākara differed from Kumārila on numerous points. 1913 The divergence starts from the very first sūtra of the P.M.S. (as the note below will show 1914). Prabhākara is called guru&rsquo; by Salikanātha in many places in the Prakarapapancikā (vide first Intro. verse and pp. 17, 32 &amp;c.). There is a very great divergence of views about the relative chronological position of Kumārila and Prabhākara. Vide &lsquo;the Prābhākara Suhool&rsquo; (1911) by M. M.

According to the star school the visayavakya is अटवर्षे ब्राह्मणमुपनयीत तमध्यापयीत, the idea in this latter case being that stody of Veda (Vedādbyayana) is only an aiga (a subsidiary matter) of the vidhi to teach a student the Veda after his upapayaga. The objections of tbe Frābbākara school against the visayavākya &lsquo;svādhyāyosdbyetavyaḥ are tbat it has a seen fruit or reward and that wbed a seen fruit can be found it is improper to suppose that there is an unseen reward.

Mapdanamiśra wrote several works on PM viz. Vidhi-viveka (published at Benares with Nyāyakapikā of Vācaspati), Bhāvanāviveka (with com. of Umbeka, edited in S. B. series), Vibbramaviveka and Mimāṁsānukramani (Chow. S. S.). The Sastradīpikā (on PMS II.1.1) cites Mandana&rsquo;s explanation of Kumārila&rsquo;s verse 1916. Therefore, Mandana is later than Kumārila or was a younger contemporary of Kumā rila and flourished about 690 to 710 A. D. Sālikanātha quotes Vidhiviveka of Mandana (pp. 243, 302) in Prakarapapañoikā, p. 178 and Brahmasiddhi in Rjuvimalā (p. 20). Moreover, Śāntarakṣita in his Tattvasangraha (GOS) frequently criticizes the kārikās of Kumārila (without naming him) and his pupil Kamalaśila names Kumārila many times. Sāntarakṣita does not name or quote Prabhākara. He flourished between</p>
<p>705-762 A. D. (vide Foreword to Tattvasangraha p XVI, GOS). Therefore, Kumārila must be placed about 650-700 A, D. As Salikanātha quotes the Slokavārtika and Mand ana&rsquo;s works he would have to be placed between 750-800 A. D. If Sālikanātha was a direct pupil of Prabhākara it follows that the latter (who appears to be unknown to Sāntarakṣita, should have been &amp; contemporary (i. e. should be held to have flourished nearly between 700–760 A. D. or a little later) and was later than Kumārila. There is a tradition that Prabhākara was a pupil of Kumārila. Traditions (such as of</p>

<p>At one time Prabhākara appears to have occupied a very prominent position. The Gadag inscription of Vikramaditya VI (in 1098 A. D.) refers to the founding of a school for teaching Prabhākaras&rsquo; system at Lakkigundi (vide E. I. vol. XV p. 348). This and the reference in the Mitākṣarā (on Yaj. II, 114) to the views of Guru on 1911 tbe Lipsāsūtra (PMS. IV. 1. 2.) in the third alternative interpretation put on that sūtra, holding that the rules about the acquisition of wealth (in Gautama and other smrtis) are purusirtha (addressed to the conscience of the performer of sacrifices ) and not krat varthu, show the outstanding position that the Prābhākara school occupied in the 11th century A. D. in the Carnatic and Maratha countries. The Madanapārijāta, a north Indian work (1360-1390 A. D.), quotes a half rerse of Guru 1948 (on p. 89). The Smṛticandrikā (on Vyavahāra p. 257), the Viramitrodaya (on vyavahāra p. 523) and the V. M. (p. 89) refer to the Nayaviveka of Bhavanātha, alaost the last outstanding work of the Prābhākara school Gradually, the Prabhākara School lost ground and the Bhāļļa school of Kumārila has been most predominant for several centuries. The present writer holds that Prabhākara is later then Kumārila but he is not in a position to say from whom he borrowed his peculiar views or whether they were started by him for the first time (though this appears more plausible). Pandit K. S. Ramaswami Sastri (in Intro. to Tantrarahasya, G. O. S., 2nd edition of 1956) holds that Prabhākara took his views from Badari (p. XXV). The learned Pandit offers hardly any tangible evidence for his remark ( on p. XIX of the Intro.) that Bidari held views similar</p>

<p>to thogo of Bhartrmitra who go interpreted the PMS as to make it atheistic. Bādari&rsquo;s views on Mimāmsā matters are quoted only four times in PMS viz. in III, 1, 3 (on what matters are sega), VL 1.27 (that vedio sacrifices can be performed oven by sūdras), VIII. 3. 6. (purely sacrificial matter about application of Şadaba procedure), IX. 3. 33. (about method of singing sūman, Bādari&rsquo;s viow being accepted by Jaimini). In none of these does one find the slightest touch of Bhartṛmitra&rsquo;s atheistic tendencies or of Prabhākara&rsquo;s special propositions,</p>
<p>From Kumārila onwards there are numerous commentaries, commentaries on commentaries and manuals on some aspects of mlmāınsa doctrines or of the contents of the PMS. Several difficult questions of identity and relationship among some of the early writers whose works are wholly or partially extant have also arisen during the last fifty years and many papers have been written. The present writer has read most of them, but if the whole evidence is to be set out and discussed a bulky volume of several hundred pages would have to be written. That cannot be done here. The several questions of identity and relationship are set out below and the present author&rsquo;s replies to all of them will be given with a little discussion on a few out of them :</p>
<p>(1) Whether Prabhākara was a pupil of Kumārila; the reply is that there is no substantial or compelling evidence for this except tradition, but Prabhākara is certainly later than Kumārila;</p>
<p>(2) Whether Salikanātha is a direct disciple of Prabhākara - yos;</p>
<p>(3) Whether Mandana was a disciple of Kumārila; there is no substantial evidence for an affirmative reply, but Mandana certainly explains in bis Bhāvanāviveka a verse of Kumarila and quotes another verse from Tantravārtika. Vide note 1946 above. In the Vidhiviveka also (Benares ed. 1907), which Mandana wrote after Bhāvanāviveka he quotes (on p. 15 abhi dhābhāvanā&hellip;linādayah) from Tantra vārtika (p. 378) and on p. 315 of the Vidhiviveka quotes (yathoktam-śreyaḥsādhanatā &hellip; &hellip;pratiyate&rsquo;) from Slokavārtika (codanāsūtra, Verse 14). Mandana also quotes a passage from the Bșhati (p. 38) of Prabhākara in Vidhiviveka 1949 (p. 109). So Mandana, if not a disciple, wag</p>

<p>(4) Are Mandaria and Umbeka identical-no; Umbeka wrote a commentary on the Bhāvanāviveka of Mandana in which on pp. 17 and 76 he discusses various readings in it; it is not possible to hold that a writer would discuss variant readings in his own work (as would follow if the two were identical).</p>
<p>(5) Are Maṇdana and Viśvarūpa identical - No;</p>
<p>(6) Are Viśvarūpa and Sureśvara identical -yes; the latter name being assumed after Viśvarūpa became a saunyāsin.</p>
<p>(7) Is Umbeka identical with Bhavabhūti &ndash; the evidence is not enough to give a definite affirmative roply; but it is likely that they may be identical.</p>
<p>(8) Is Umbeka a disciple of Kumirila – y6s; as shown in note below. 1950</p>
<ol start="1950">
<li>That l&rsquo;abeka was a pupil of Kumārila follows from the following considerations. In his com, on the Bhāvanāviveka (p 43 ) Umbeka quotes a half verse from Bhattapāda (TuT YEYTT: Trace EUAUFTATTI TUT 2 ) and on the same page be quotes another half verse&rsquo; TO TF07-37744</li>

<p>TRETT ETA HTETET Everfura&rsquo;. These two balves make one verse on p. 383 of the Tantravārtika, the latter half of which is again ascribed by Umbeka (on p. 92 of bis com. Od the same work) to Bhattapada. It follows tbat Bhattapada was bis guru. Prof. Kunban Raja tries to wriggle out by advancing the theory (on pp. XXXVII-XXXVIII of bis Tatro.) that some later scribe ioserted the word &lsquo;guruṇā&rsquo; and argues that there is ao proof of Bhattapāda being Umbeka&rsquo;s guru. Uoless another reliable as, of Umbeka&rsquo;s commentary is found whicb omits the word &lsquo;guruṇā&rsquo; or substitutes in its place some other word it is not open to us to hold that tbe reading is not trustworthy and then build positive or negative propositions on our own speculations alone. The Uveyaka whose view is quoted by Kamalasila in Tattvasaógraha (G. O. S p 812 ' nar</p>
<p>MICHER ATH atat STATOTT, FR art, ata hatiani) is probably gran, whose pame is written in several different ways in works and moss. (vide M. M. Jba&rsquo;s latro, to Bhāvanāviveka p. 2). If tbis identity is correct 3 must bave fourished before 750 A, D and chronology would not be against Unbeka being a pupil of Kumārila. The Yukti-snebaprapūrani on Sastra dipikā quotes Umbekabbatta in several places. But one loog quolation from Umbeka on p. 30 is very striking. In this both Sabara and Vārtika kāra (i e Kumārila) are severely criticized and after quoting the famous verse frequently cited in the Mabābhārata viittaneet &hellip; giant paura he discards the views of the Vārtikakāra. Sabara is separated from Umbeka by several centuries and was oot Umbeka&rsquo;s guru. Therefore, this passage (that occurs on pp. 105-108 of the arcuielil of Umbeka on slokavārtika, pob. by Madras Uo, in 1940 ) leads to the inference that the Vārtikakāra was</p>
<p>(Continued on next page )</p>
<p>Chronologiacal position of Kumarila and others 1195 (9) Is Sureśvara, a pupil of Saṅkarācārya ? &ndash;Yes. .</p>
<p>The result of the above replies is that the following is the most probable- chronological order of Parvamimārsā writers mentioned in questions 1 to 9 viz. Kumārila, Prabhākara, Mandana, Umbeka, Sālikanātha. They flourished between 650 A. D. to 750 A. D., Kumārila boing the earliest of the five, Prabhākara (who quotes Kirātārjuniya II, 30 twice on pp. 24%, 343) and Mandana being contemporaries or Mandana being younger than Prabhākara.</p>
<p>The opening and ending verses in Sureśvara&rsquo;s Vārtika on the bhāṣya of Saṅkara on the Bṛ. Up. and the Tai, Up. leave no room for doubt that he was a disciple of Saṅkara.</p>
<p>From the present author&rsquo;s paper in JBBRAS for 1928, pp. 289-293 and Prof. Kuppuswami&rsquo;s paper on &lsquo;Mandana, Sureśvara equation in the History of Vedānta&rsquo;in ABORI Vol. 18 pp. 121 157 it follows that Mandana and Sureśvara are not identical.</p>
<p>Some remarks in the learned Introduction of Prof. Kunhan Raja to the edition of Umbeka&rsquo;s Com. on the Ślokavārtika invito criticism. Prof. Raja (on p. XLIX) states that his attempt has been only to raise doubts and to attempt at weighing the evid. ence for and against various theories. The present writer has no serious objection to this. But he thinks that Prof. Raja has gone wrong in his interpretation of words like &lsquo;anupasitagura vas-codayanti&rsquo;(p.33) and &lsquo;anupāsitaguruprajñā-vilasitam-iti&quot;1951 grantha-jñāna-mānino manyante&rsquo; (p. 30). He starts (XLII) by saying &ldquo;whether it meant (i.e. anupasitaguru&rsquo; meant) one by</p>

<p>whom the teacher was not respected or a teacher who was not respected (by his disciples)&rsquo; and then proceeds but the expres sion &lsquo;upāsitagurutām&rsquo; (appearing in the commentary on the 2nd verse of the Sloka vārtika) settles the point. It must mean &lsquo;one by whom the teacher was not respected&rsquo;. &lsquo;Upāsita-guru&rsquo; literally means &lsquo;one who waited on the guru i. e, listened to the explanations of his teacher and made them bis own&rsquo;. &lsquo;Honoured&rsquo; is at most a secondary meaning of &lsquo;upāsita&rsquo;. Upa-ās literally means &lsquo;sit near, wait upon&rsquo;. I fail to see how it settles the point. The word &lsquo;upāsita-gurutām&rsquo; (when introducing the 2nd intro. verse of the Slokavārtika) is applied by Umbeka to Kumarila himself in relation to the Slokavārtika verse abhi vandya gurūpādau'. It means the characteristic or quality of one who has served his teacher i. e. who has carefully listened to what tbe guru expounded and understood it,' The exprossion &lsquo;anupāsitaguru&rsquo; (which, according to Prof. Raja, always refers to Prabbākara) frequently (vide also pp. 14, 52, 75, 291, 441 ) used by Umbeka means &lsquo;he or those who have not waited upon the guru and listened to his words carefully and therefore have failed to grasp the correct meaning of the passages&rsquo;. The infer ence suggested by these words of derision is that the objector (either Prabhākara or some one else ) has not understood the doctrine taught by Kumārila to him and the present author is disposed to hold that the frequent emphasis on the word &lsquo;guru&rsquo; in anupasitaguru' is a veiled reference to Prabhākara-guru (as Sālikanātha puts his nanie in his Prakarana-pancikā Prabba kara-guror drstyā), who was Kumārila&rsquo;s pupil but deviated from bis guru&rsquo;s doctrines and wrote against them and Umbeka attacks and derides him for this. Supposing that Prabhākara had once been &amp; pupil of Kumārila and later on propounded views that very much diverged from Kumārila&rsquo;s, it is natural if Umbeka took up the cudgels on behalf of Kumarila and attacked Frabbā. kara as one who had forsaken lis Guru&rsquo;s views, had not digested them properly and had written a work (not now available but well-known to Umbeka) severely attacking Kumārila. Prof. Raja (Intro. pp. XLIII and XLIV) throws out the suggestion that on p. 14 and p. 291 Umbeka possibly suggests that Prabhā kara preceded Kumārila. There is nothing of the kind. Umbeka holda that Prabhākara had not grasped his master&rsquo;s doctrines and tries to show what the real doctrine misunderstood</p>
<p>by Prabhākara was.</p>
<p>• It appears desirable to get out a tentative chronological table</p>
<p>of the outstanding works and writers of the Pūrvam māmsā, with</p>
<p>Probable dates of prominant writers on PM 1198 a few remarks here and there. Most of the dates are a &lsquo;proximate and tentative.</p>
<p>Pūrvamīmārsāsūtra of Jaimini - 400 B. C. to 200 B.O.</p>
<p>Vșttikāra - There is great conflict of views about the person who the Vșttikāra quoted several times by Sabara was. Pārthasarathi in Śāstradipikā p. 48 (first line) holds that he is Upavarṣa. Vșttikāra is cited with great respect by Sabara, but he also differs from him frequently.. The Prapancahrdaya (p. 39) attributes to Bodhāyana an extensive commentary called Kṛtakoṭi on both mimāṁsās. It is remarkable that Bodhāyana is not mentioned by name by any early work on P.M. S. nor doos Saṅkara mention him though he twice mentione Upavarṣa. Rāmānujācārya in the opening words of his bhāṣya on Brahma sutra refers to the extensive commentary of Bodhāyana on the Brahmasūtra. But he does not say that Bodhāyana commented on P. M. S. The present author is not even now prepared to hold that Vṛttikāra mentioned by Sabāra so often is identical with Upavarṣa. Sabara cites at some length the different inter pretation of PMS I. 1. 3-5 by Vșttikāra and in the midst of it mentions (on p. 45 ) by name the view of Upavarṣa on &lsquo;what is sabda&rsquo;. He appears to regard the two as different. The fact that the Tantravārtika (pp. 602-3 on II. 3. 16 ) appears to identify Upavarṣa with Vrttikāra is not conclusive. From Kumārila himself we know that several Vșttis were written on PMS before as well as after Sabara. So even Upavarsa may have been deemed to be Vșttikāra by Kumārila (on II, 3. 16 ) and his views quoted, though the Vrttikāra in other places in Sabara&rsquo;s bhāṣya may be different.</p>
<p>Upavarṣa - between 100 B. C. to 100 A.D.</p>
<p>Bhavadāsa - The Slokavārtika (Pratijñāsūtra, v. 63) men tions him by name and verse 33 of the same as explained by the Nyāyaratnākara shows that Bhavadāsa was deemed to be earlier than Sabara by the Slokavārtika; between 100–200 A.D.</p>
<p>Savara &ndash; between 200-400 A.D. (nearer the former date ). From the Tantravārtika on II. 3. 23 p. 612, on II, 3. 27 p. 620 and III, 4. 31 p. 967 it appears that there was another person called Bbāṣyakārāntara, who was earlier than Sabara From Tantravārtika on III. 4. 12 (p. 909) and Tup-tikā on VI. 5. 10 (p. 1462) it seems that Kumārila sometimes applies the word vṛttikāra to Sabara also.</p>

<p>Umbeka - pupil of Kumārila and commentator of Sloka vārtika and of Mandana&rsquo;s Bhāvanāviveka; generally identified with dramatist Bhavabhūti between 700-750 A. D.</p>
<p>Salikanātha - pupil of Prabhākara and author of the com mentary Rjuvimala on Prabhākara&rsquo;s Brhati and of an independ ent work &lsquo;Prakaraṇa-pañoikā&rsquo;. It is noteworthy that in Rjupimalā on Bṭhati (p. 91) he quotes a verse from Ślokavārtika (Vākyādhikaraña verses 43-44) and refers to Kumārila with great respect as &lsquo;Yadābur-Vārtikakāra-miśrāḥ&rsquo;; 710-770 A.

<li>One circumstance wbich fixes the earliest limit of Kumārila&rsquo;s time is furnished by the Kāsikā (com. on Aṣtādbyāyi). In the lengthy pūrvapaksa against Grammar contained in the Tantravārtika on P. M. S. I. 3. 24 (from p, 254 onwards), on p. 260 an objection is raised that Pāṇini himself violates bis own roles laid down in &lsquo;tsjakābhyām kartari&rsquo; (Pān. II. 2. 15) in the sūtras &ldquo;Janikartuh praksti” (Pān, I. 4,30) and &lsquo;tatprayojako betuśca&rsquo; (Pāo.

<p>Some Fundamental Doctrines of Purvamimāmsā</p>
<p>Some of the characteristic fundamental doctrines of the Pūrvamimāṁsā will now be set out with some references and a few renarks as to some of them, the views of Prabhakara and his followers being also rarely referred to</p>
<p>(1) Veda is eternal, self-existent, not composed by any author, human or divine, and is infallible. This is the core of the P, M, system. Vide P. M. S. 1. 1. 27-32 and Sabara on 1, 1. 5 (p. 53) and ślokavārtika (Vākyādhikarana, verges 1953 366 368). The argument briefly is; Veda is learnt at present and . was studied in tbe past also by students from teachers, that there is no evidence about the person who first composed it or who first studied it. If it be argued that such a reasoning may be put forward as regards the Mahabharata, the reply is that people know that Vyāsa is the author of it. Similarly, the passages in Smrtis and Purānas that Prajapati created the Veda are merely artharadas (laudatory ) not based on any evidence or perception and are meant only to convey the absolute autho ritativeness of the Veda. If the connection between word and . songe is eternal and not brought about by any person, the same reasoning holds good as to the Veda. This view is opposed to the view of the Naiyāyikas who hold that God is the author of the Voda or the interpretation of V. S. I. 1. 3 (Sastrayonitvāt) by Saṅkarācārya based on Br. Up. II, 4. 10. Manu I, 21 ( stating that Brahmā created from the words of the Voda the names and appropriate duties of all) seems to suggest that (according to</p>

<p>Eternality of the Deda</p>
<p>1203</p>
<p>Manu) the Veda was self-existent. Similarly, the Mahābhāṣya on Vārtika 3 on Pāṇini IV. 3. 101 (&ldquo;tena proktam&rsquo;) remarks 1954 that the Vedas were not composed by anyone, that they are eternal, that the meaning of the Veda is eternal, but the arrange ment of the letters is not eternal and therefore we have different vedic texts like Kāthaka, Kālāpaka, Paippalādaka &amp;c. The Smṛtis also sometimes state that there is no author of the Veda, that Brahmā remembers it and that Manu also has remembrance of Dharma in different Kalpas (Parāśarasmrti I, 21).</p>
<p>In P. M. S. I. 1. 28 (‘Anityadarsanāc-ca') the opponent of the eternality of the Veda puts forward such passages as &lsquo;Babara Prāvāhaṇi (son of Pravāhapa) desired&rsquo; (Tai. 8. VII. 1. 10. 2) and &lsquo;Kusuruvinda Auddalaki desired&rsquo; (Tai. S. VII. 2. %. 1), which mention men named Prāvāhani and Auddalaki (son of Uddālaka) that are mortals and argues that Veda did not exist before those mortals and is, therefore, not eternal. To this the Siddhānta replies in P. M. S. I. 1. 31 (&lsquo;param tu śrutisāmānyam&rsquo;) that such examples are to be explained differently viz, &lsquo;Babara&rsquo; is a onomatopoetic word meaning &lsquo;rustling&rsquo; and Prāvāhaṛi (from &lsquo;pra&rsquo; and &lsquo;vāhay&rsquo; causal of lah) means the wind</p>
<p>It may be noted that centuries before Jaimini and Yaska there was a school of Vedic interpreters called &lsquo;Aitibāsikas&rsquo;. For example, Rg. X. 98.5 and 7 refer to Devāpi, son of Rṣtiṣena, and to Santanu. Yāska ( in Nirukta II. 10), starting with the words &ldquo;tatra-itihāsamācakṣate' states that Devāpi and Santanu were brothers of the Kuru family and the younger brother Santanu wa8.crowned king ignoring the rights of the elder and that these verses refer to them. In Rg. X. 10 there is a dialogue between Yama and Yami and Nir. V. 2 refers to the 8th verse of it. Those who hold that Veda is eternal would explain Yama as Aditya and Yami as &lsquo;Night&rsquo;. Rg. III. 33 is a dialogue between the sage Visvimitra and the rivers. The Nir. (II. 25–27) explains verses 5-6 and 10 of that hymn from the Aitihānika point of view and states that Viśvāmitra was son of king Kusika and does not mention the Nairukta interpretation of these verses.</p>

The FTATATEE I. 3,30 Ton Ta ' also emphasizes the difference between 0 and irri.</p>

<p>About the Asvins the Nirukta (XII. 1) states several views viz. they are Heaven and Earth, or Day and Night, or the Sun and the Moon and remarks that according to the Aitihasikas they were kings who had accumulated great morit. Probably the Nairuktas were divided among themselves and explained that the Asvins represented different natural phenomena. About Vrtra ( occurring in such verses as Rg. I. 32. 11 ) the Nairuktas (Etymologists) said in Nirukta II. 16 that the word means &lsquo;cloud&rsquo;, while the Aitihasikas say that he (Vitra) was an Agura, son of Tyastr. As to the hymn Rg. 1, 105 of 19 verses (in the first 18 of which the refrain is vittam me asya rodasi&rsquo;) the Nirukta IV. 6 states that the hymn was seen by Trita who was thrown into a well In Rg. VII. 33. 11 there is mention of . Urvasi and Vasiṣtha (Maitrā.Varupa) as born of Urvasi and Nirukta (V.13-14) explains that verse and remarks that Urvasi was an apsaras and Rg. X. 95 is a dialogue between Aila Purū ravas and Urvash. But the interpretation of the Nairuktas and Aitihasikas on this story are not expressly set out. Probably the Nairuktas would explain Urvasi as lightning and Pururavas as the roaring wind. The hymn Rg. X. 108 is a dialogue between Sarama (Indra&rsquo;s bitch) and the Panis and the Nirukta XI, 25 explains the first verse and remarks that there is a story (Akhyāna) therein viz. that there was &amp; dialogue between Saramā sent by Indra and the Paṇis who were Asuras. In all such legends the Nairuktas would insist that they are to be taken allegorically as referring to natural phenomena, while the Aitihāsikas would insist that there is historical basis in all these. Though it is not stated by the Ninukta expressly that the Aitibāsikas do not hold the doctrine of the eternality of the Veda it implicitly follows from their explanations that they did not subscribe to that doctrine.</p>

<p>the connection of word and sense. Vide P. M. 8. I. 1.6-23, Sabara&rsquo;s bhāṣya thereon, the elaborate treatment in 444 yerses in Ślokavārtika (pp. 728-8'5) and Prakarana-pañoikā pp. 133-140 (seventh Prakarana). On the question &ldquo;what does a word like &ldquo;Gauh&rsquo; denote,&rdquo; the P. M. 8. replies that a word denotes &lsquo;aksti&rsquo; (or jāti) i. e, the universal, the class. Briefly, the Mimārgakas hold that the word, the denotation and the relation of these two are eternal. Vide P. M, S, I. 3. 30-35.</p>

<li>The individual soul. The P. M. 8. does not expressly affirm the existence of the soul in any sutra. Saṅkarācārya on V. S. III. 3. 53 refers to this fact, states that Sabara, the Bhāṣya kāra, propounded the existence of the soul and that the venerable Upavarga refrained from going into that question in his exposi tion of the Pārvamimamga with the remark that he would expound it when dealing with Sāriraka (i. e, the Vedanta-sūtra ). It was probably due to this fact of the absence of a statement about the soul that the Pūrvamimāṁsā was interpreted by some as favouring atheism, Kumārila complains that the Minārsā, though not really atheistic, was put forward as Lokāyata (atheistic) 1956 by some and that therefore he endeavours ( in the</li>

The other view is that the letters manifest the sphoṭa and it is the sphota that conveys the sense. This subject cannot be dealt with in this work.</p>

The न्या. र. notes that भर्पमित्र put forward several wrong doctrines about the Mimāmsā such as the one that the performance of obligatory acts or of prohibited acts leads to do desirable or undesirable results. Vide H. of Dh, vol. III. pp. 46-47 note 57 and vol, II. pp. 358-359 on लोकायतिक and नास्तिक.

<p>Ślokavārtika) to show that it treads the path of belief (in soul and another world). The souls are many, eternal, all-pervading (omnipresent) and different from the body, the senses and the mind. The soul resides in the body, is the agent ( karl) as well as blɔkir (enjoyer), is of the nature of puro consciousness, and is cognised by itself (svasamvedya). Though the P.M.S. does not expressly deal with the existence of the soul, there are indications that the P. M. S. itself must have impliedly accepted the existence of the soul. The reward of many religious rites is Svarga and the P. M. S. refers to numerous Vedic paysages where svarga is the reward of rites and assumes that the reward goes to the performer (e. g. in the adhiburana III, 7. 18-20 begin. ning with &lsquo;Sastraphalam prayoktari&rsquo; that expounds the meaning of such vedic passages as &lsquo;agnihotram juhuyāt svargakāmak&rsquo;). Sabara on I. 1. 5 expounds at great length the existence of the soul as different from the body, sepse3 &amp;c. (vide particularly pp. - 60–72 of Ānan. ed.). The Slokavārtika devotos 148 verses to this subject and the Tantravārtika also briefly deals with it on P.M. S. II. 1.5 (pp. 402-403). The Slokavāritka (Atmavāda, Verse 148 ) has this interesting verse 1957 &lsquo;the Bhāṣyakāra (Sabara) desirous of refuting atheism has established here (i. e, in bbāṣya passages) by reasoning the existence of the soul; the</p>

<li>God and the devatās in sacrifices. Sabara&rsquo;s position is that the Vedas were not created by God, nor was the connection between word and sense created by Him. The Prakararapancikā also (pp. 137 ff) denies &amp; creator for the whole universe. Kumārila&rsquo;s position 1958 also is peculiar and startling. He says in the Slokavārtika that it is difficult to prove that God first created the world together with Dharma and Adharma and the means of attaining these, words, sepses, and their relations and the Veda. Thus it appears that he does not expressly deny the existence of a supreme power or God but simpily ignores such power or God. In spite of this he begins his Slokavārtika with an obeisance to Siva. 1959 The Nyāyaratnākara says that the verse can also be an apotheosis of Yajña. But in that case Kumārila would have to be charged with duplicity. It is better to say that the tradition of beginning a work with a mangala verso could not be discarded even by Kumārila,</li>

<p>The consideration of the question of what is meant by the deratā with reference to which an offering is cast into the sacred fire leads to startling results. Jaimini (in VII. 1. 32-34) takes the position that in a sacrifice the havis (offering) is the principal matter while the devatā is a subordinate ono (guna) and that if there be a conflict between the havis and the devatā, the final conclusion is to be arrived at by relying on the havis. The reasoning is that the Veda connects the deity with the sacrificial act, as in &lsquo;one desirous of progeny should offer an havis for Indra and Agni cooked on eleven potsherds and then Indra confers on him progeny&rsquo; (Tai. S. II, 2. 1. 1.). Even though</p>

The Sastradipika advances the argument that if the devatā had a body, ate, drank and was pleased, devata will be anitya (ephemeral) and could not in that case be treated of in the Veda that is eternal. He further asserts that men of limited intelligence not knowing the real import of the Vedic passages may hold wrong opinions. Sabara notes (on X. 4. 23 ) that there are various opinions as to who the Dovatās are to whom either a hymn (sūkta) is addressed (as Rg. I. 94) or to whom &lsquo;havis&rsquo; is directed by the Veda to be offered as in&rsquo; one should offer to Agni an offering cooked on eight potsherds&rsquo;; that the devatā becomes connected with the sacrifice not in its own nature but by the word used with reference to an offering and that where the Veda directs an offering to be made to Agni, one cannot use a synonym for Agni such as &lsquo;Suci, Pāvaka, Dhumaketu, Krśanu, Vaisvānara or Sāpdilya. Thus Devatā is a matter of words, as admitted by 141</p>

<p>Śabara. The Prakaranapancikā also states that there is no proof that a sacrifice (vāga) is a means of pleasing the deity and that to say that there is worship of a deity in a yāga is really metaphorical. From this and the proceding doctrine (No. 1) it follows that P. M. 8., Sabara, and Kumārila discard the idea that the Veda is the word of God or that rewards of religious acts are due to the favour or grace of God. It is therefore that the Padmapurāṇa quoted (in note 1957a) above dubs Jaimini&rsquo;s doctrine &lsquo;girīśvaravāda&rsquo; (Godless).</p>
<p>When the Veda says one desirous of heaven should perform a sacrifice&rsquo;, three ākāṇkṣās (expectancies) arise. The first is</p>
<p>what is to be brought about'; this is satisfied by the word svarga, stating the reward or the purpose. The 2nd is &lsquo;by what means&rsquo; is the first to be brought about. That is satisfied by the meaning of the root &lsquo;yaj&rsquo; (i, e. by yāga); the third is &lsquo;what is the procedure or in what manner&rsquo;; that is satisfied by the eata blishment of the sacred firus and other rites that are described in the context of the passage &lsquo;svargakāmo yajeta&rsquo;. It is learnt from this passage that the reward or purpose (svarga) springs from ( is brought about by) yāga and not by the dovatā. 192</p>
<p>Later writers could not digest all these ideas about the deities in sacrifices. Venkatanātha (or Venkatadeśika, 1269– 1369 A. D.) composed a work called &lsquo;Seśvaramimārsa&rsquo;, in which he oriticizes both Bhatta and Prābhākara schools and being an ardent Vaispava of the Ramānuja school attempts &amp; synthesis of the two mimāmgās and brings in the idea of God as the dispenser of the reward of sacrifices against the combined testimony of Sabara, Kumārila, Salikanātha and others.

The Slokavāratika goes so far as to say it must be admitted that all these ( worlds &amp;c.) existed before the creator, and again such a creator may be proved (by anumāna) to have been preceded by the Voda on account of his being an intelligent being, just as ourselves are praceded by the Veda.'</p>

<p>The doctrine of upūria (invisible mysterious or subtle potency). The Veda lays down that one desirous of heaven should perform a sacrifice. But the reward heaven comes off only after a long time, while the sacrifice lasts only for a short time. There would thus be no direct connection between the sacrifice (the cause ) and heaven ( the reward) or purpose. It must be presumed from the Vedic injunction that there is some connecting link between the activity of man to perform a yāga and the reward. Before the principal and subordinate acta in a sacrifice are performed men have no capacity for svarga and sacrifices (described in the texta) are also incapable of producing the effect &lsquo;svarga&rsquo;. The principal and subsidiary sots in a sacri. fice when carried out remove the incapacity and produce &amp; certain capacity or potency for svarga. This must be admitted by all. Unless such a capacity exists there would be the unac ceptable conclusion that not doing the acts and doing them are on the same level. This capacity or potency either rosiding in the man (agent) or arising from the sacrifice that is performed is called apūrvu in this sāstra. It is true that this capacity cannot be proved by direct perception or other means of know ledge except by śrutārthāpatis. When we are told that a man</p>

<p>Idea of apūrva.</p>
<p>• 1211</p>
<p>who is fat does not eat by day we presume, in order to account for this, that he must be eating food at night. Similarly, the Veda brings sacrifice and svarga together; we have to presume that sacrifice gives rise to a subtle potency, though the sacrifice itself comes to an end in a short time, and that this potency is the cause of bringing about the reward svarga and that we may look upon it as abiding in the soul of the sacrificer or as an : invisible effect (a reaching forth of the yāga itself that has vanished ). 1961 Mimāmsakas do not admit that the results of religious acts are given by God. The V. S. III 2. 40 states that this is the view of Jaimini (dharmam Jaiminir-ata eva) and is opposed to the view of Bādarayana, Saṅkara and the Bbāmati that it is God who confers the reward. According to the Prakaranapanoikā (p. 186 ) the invisible force or potency is not in the agent but arises as a subtle form from the action itself. Four kinds of Apūrvalos (with further sub-divisions) as regards Darśapūrṇamāsa sacrifice are stated by Madhavācārya.</p>
<p>The idea is that every rite as a whole produces an apūrva, and that each subordinate part (anga) of the rite has also an (apūrva) which is subordinate to the apūrva of the whole rite.</p>

<p>If one holds the view that apūrva is some potency coming to reside in the performer of a sacrifice one&rsquo;s views would be like those of some modern writers who hold that real prayer is not mere repetition of certain words deemed to be sacred, but it is an upward movement or a real increase in the intensity of spiritual power in the man who prays, it being immaterial to ask to whom he prays (vide W.

<p>Idea of svarga in Purvamimāṁsa</p>
<p>1913</p>
<p>165-167 and 168-171 for descriptions of the joys of heaven in the Vedic literature, the Epic and the Purāṇas. From considera tions of space the remarks will have to be brief. In Rg. IX, 113, 7-11 the sage prays to Soma to place him in that immortal world where there is continuous light, where all desires are fulfilled, where there are joys of various grades. Heaven was deemed to be the place where the souls of valiant men that fought battles and sacrificed their lives wont (Rg. VI. 46. 12) and in Rg. X 154. 2-4 the soul of the dead is asked to join those departed men that had become invincible by great tapas, that had died in battle, that had made gifts of a thousand cows, that had led a life of right and virtue and that were wise sages.</p>
<p>The Atharvaveda IV. 34.2 and 5-6 say that in heaven there are many women, they got edible plants and flowers of various kinds, there are streams of ghee, honey and wine ( sura), milk, curds and there are lotus ponds all round. The Satapatha Br. (XIV. 7. 1. 32–33) states that the joys of heaven are 100 times greater than those on earth. Vide Macdonnell&rsquo;s &lsquo;Vedic Mythology&rsquo; pp. 167-168 and A. B. Keith&rsquo;s &lsquo;Religion and philo sophy of the Veda&rsquo;sto. pp. 403-406 (1924). Even the Upaniṣads refer to the joys of heaven e. g. Chan. VIII. 5. 3. speaks of two lakes in the world of Brahmā, aśvattha tree showering down Soma and the city of Bṛahmā calld Aparājitā; the Kausitaki Up. (I. 3 and 4) elaborates this and adds that five hundred Apsarases go out to meet him (who reaches heaven), one hundred with garlands in their hands, one hundred with ointments, one hundred with perfumes, one hundred with garments and one hundred with fruits. Poets like Kālidāsa love to dwell upon the instantaneous arrival of the soul of the warrior whose head was cut off in battle and who was at once joined by an apsaras in heaven (vide Raghuvamsa VII. 51 &lsquo;Vāmāógasamsaktasuran gunaḥ svam prtyat-kabandham samare dadarś&amp;'). The Purānas furnish graphic descriptions of the joys of heaven. Vide Brahma purāṇa 225. 6, Padma II. 95. 2-5, Mārkandeya 10. 93-95, which enumerate Nandana garden, aerial cars with bevies of Apsarases, golden beds and seats, absence of sorrows, all pleasure &amp;c. Sabara on P. M. S. VI. 1. 1 refers to two popular views about svarga; one is, whatever gives pleasure to a person such as silken garments of fine texture, sandalwood, damsels sixteen years old is designated starga. Another popular view is that svarga is a certain place where there is no heat nor cold, no hunger nor thirst, no dissatisfaction, no tiredness.</p>

<p>1 Sec. VII, Oh. XXIX</p>
<p>Sabara and Kumārila say that popular 1968 ideas about svarga are invalid, that the Mahabharata and Purīgas, being composed by men, need not be considered and that the Vedic descriptions of svarga are more arthavādas for praise,</p>
<p>___P. M. S. IV. 3. 15. provides that svarga 199 is the reward of all religious acts (such as Viśvajit) for which no express reward is provided by the texts. Sabara states &lsquo;happiness is svarga and all seek that&rsquo;; an old verze says &lsquo;that state of happiness in which there is no mixing of pain, which is not immediately overwhelmed by pain, that comes to one when one desires it, is called by the word srar (svarga)&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Medhātithi remarks that smitis sometimes state 1970 that the gift of a single cow yields all rewards and relieves from sins with the result that fruits of great religious acts and of slight ones would be deemed to be the same but it should be under stood that the rewards diffor in their duration; otherwise, no one would engage in great or difficult rites.</p>
<p>Some Vedic rites expressly declare fruits of sacrifices that are other than svarga. For example, the Tai, 8. provides one desirous of (plenty of) cattle should offer the catrd sacrifice&rsquo; (II. 4.6. 1.) or one desirous of (leadership or control over ) a village should offer the Isti called Sangrahant&rsquo; (Tal. S. II. 3. 9.2.).</p>

<p>Idea of svarga</p>
<p>1215</p>
<p>Sabara says the Veda does not say that the result of such sacrifices cannot be had in this very life. This the Tupṭikā. 19 expands in an interesting note. The remedy declared by the Veda for securing desired objects (son&rsquo;s birth and the like) is bound to yield the result in this life or in the next. If a man has committed evil deeds in a previous life he has to undergo the effects of those sing and while he is undergoing the effects of sins the fruits of sacrifices are postponed. But if the effects of sins have been extremely reduced be secures the fruits of kāmya rites in this very life. The words of the Veda laying down an injunction state only so much that the fruit of the rite performed does come about but they do not say that the fruit follows immediately ( after the rite is performed). Therefore, there is no definiteness (about the time when the fruit will follow). But svarga is to be enjoyed only in another life (as a fruit of rites performed in this life). It (avarga) means unequalled happin488 and is achieved in a degree proportionate to the actions; but it cannot be enjoyed in this life, since men experience in this world every moment both happiness and misery. Every happiness is not the fruit of Jyotiṣtoma and every being does not perform Jyotistoma. But some happiness does come to a man. Therefore, it (happiness ) is natural. The existence, however, of another body has to be imagined for the experience of unequalled happi ness, there being no other reasonable explanation. That unequalled happiness does not come to a man unless he dies; therefore svarga is to be enjoyed in another life.</p>

They both say that liberation consists in not having to assume a body again. 1972 The śloka vārtika states &lsquo;one desiring Mokṣa should not do any aot that is forbidden or is Kumya (proscribed for those who desire an object like riches, son &amp;c); he should perform obligatory rites (euch as agnihotra) and naimittika (like bath, japa and gifts on eclipse &amp;c.) in order to avoid the sin that would accrue owing to non performance of those two; if he does not desire the rewards of doing pitya and naimittika acts they will not come to him, as such a reward comes to him who seeks it. The results of aots in a former life would be eliminated by undergoing them in the life in which he seeks liberation. This differs from Saṅkarācārya&rsquo;s position who holds on V. S. IV. 3. 14 that, as declared in the Svet. Up. III. 8, there is no other way to Moksa except knowledge and realization of the Ātman. In bis bhāsys on the same sūtra he seems to attack 1973 Kumarila&rsquo;s position. According to Kumārila Upaniṣad passages about the knowledge of the Atman are only arthavādas as thoy convey to the performer the knowledge that he has a soul and that the soul has certain characteristics, while Saṅkara maintains (on V. S. I. 1. 1) that the phala, the subject of investigation and the Vedic exhortation (codanā) are different in Pūrvamināmsā and in Brahamaml māmsā. There exist smrtis that ridiculed the idea that the mere</p>

<p>Doctrines of early R. M, writers are startling</p>
<p>1217</p>
<p>knowledge of the Self would lead to Mokṣa. For example, 1974 the Br. Y. Y. affirms that both knowledge and actions lead to Liberation, that to say that knowledge alone leads to liberation is a sign of indolence, that out of the fear of bodily labour ignorant men do not want to engage in actions.</p>
<p>The doctrines of the early and principal writers on Pūrya mimāṁsā are rather quaint and startling. Their arguments about the eternality and self-existence of the Veda are fallacious and were not accepted even by other ancient Indian systems. Both Prabhākara and Kumārila have in their scheme no place for God as the dispenser of rewards or as the ruler of man&rsquo;s destiny, as being pleased with men&rsquo;s prayers. They do not expressly deny the existence of God, but they assign to God or the deities mentioned in the Vedic texts a secondary role or rather practi cally no role at all. They raise yajia to the position of God and their dogmas about yajña seem to be based upon a sort of commercial or business-like system, 1975 viz, one should do so many acts, dispense gifts to priests, offer certain offerings, observe certain ethical rules and other rules of conduct (such as not eating flesh, su bsisting on milk ) 1976 and then the reward would follow without the intervention of God. There is hardly any appeal to religious emotions, there is no omniscient Boing, no Creator and no creation of the world. The Pūrvam māmsā no doubt lays emphasis on the rights and) duties of man in life. The other darśanas are far more concerned with the ques tion of escaping permanently from the world and with man&rsquo;s destiny after death. The P.M.S, Sabara and Kumārila, how ever, make substantial contributions to the exegesis of Vedic</p>

<p>The doctrine that the Veda is eternal and of absolute and unquestioned authority has led to certain undesirable tendencies. Propounders of new doctrines make great efforts to show that there is Vedic authority for what they hold. For example, the gutras in V. S. I. 1. 5-18 are concerned to show that the Upaniṣads do not postulate Pradhana as the cause of the world, as the Sāṅkhyas imagine. Saṅkarācārya expressly states that the Saṅkhyas explain Vedānta passages as favourable to their theories and therefore a refutation of their arguments was 1977 provided in V, 8. I. 1. 5-18. It has been shown above how followers of Sākta worship try to interpret a verse like Rgveda V, 47. 4 (catvāra Im bibhrati &amp;c) as referring to the Sakta doctrines and how treatisos dignified with the title of Upaniṣads were produced by sākta writers such as the Bhāvanopaniṣad. Sabara in his bhāṣya on PMS. 1. 1. 5 states that the Vijñānavādi Bauddhas put forward Bṭ. Up. IV. 5. 13 (Vijñānaghana evaitebhyo bhūtebbyaḥ samutthāya tānyevānuvinaśyati na pretya sanjñāsti) as supporting their position. One of the most glaring examples of this tendency is the explanation of Rg. L. 141. 1-3 by Anandatirtha, also called Madhyācārya, who in &lsquo;Mahābhārata-tātparya-nirnaya&rsquo; claims to be the third incarna tion of Vayu, the other two being Hanūmat and Bhimasena, one</p>

<p>of the Pāṇdaves, and who endeavours to interpret Rg. I. 141; 1-3 as referring to these three avatāras. 1918 The words *Madhvaḥ&rsquo; and &lsquo;Mātariśva&rsquo; (meaning &lsquo;wind-god&rsquo;) occur in Rg. I. 141. 3. This was deemed sufficient to claim that Madhya, the propounder of the Dvaita system, was mentioned in the Rgveda. I do not know how Madhvācārya would have met the charge of Veda not being eternal if it referred to Bhimasena (who oven&rsquo; according to the traditional account in the Mahābhārata lived at the end of Dvāpara age i. e. about 5000 years ago) and to Madhva himself who lived barely seven centuries ago. The Veda would be later than those dates. The argument that this refers to a previous Kalpa would not be available to rebut the charge, as the Kalpa, Manvantara and Mahāyuga when Bhima and Madhvācārya flourished and in the present day are the same. There was no pralaya (dissolution of the world) at the end of Dvāpara and Kaliyuga immediately set in. The Bhārata war was fought between Dvāpara and Kali (Ādiparva 2. 13) and Kaliyuga was about to start at the time of that war (vide Vanaparva &lsquo;etat kaliyugam nāmācirād-yad pravartate&rsquo; and Salya 60. 25 (prāptam Kaliyugam viddhi)&rsquo;. It is on account of this pretention that he was very roughly handled by eminent writers like Appayya-dikṣita who charges Madhya with citing fabrioated Vedic and other texts in support of his doctrines. Vide I.. A. vol. 62 at p. 189 where the writer, Shri Venkatasubbiah, sets out over thirty works mentioned by Madhya which he states occur nowhere else. M. M. Chinna swami, who has edited (Benares, 1941) Appayya&rsquo;s work in 60 Verses with the commentary of Appayya called Madhyamata vidhyamsana and notes of his own, sets out on p. 4 thirty-six unknown works and the sūtras where they are cited by Appayya.</p>

<p>It is remarkable that great acaryas like Saṅkara and Ramanuja never claimed in their own works that they wore the avatāras of some deity. It was left to their disciples to say so, if at all.</p>
<p>Having established that Voda is eternal and self existent the Mimāınsakas give free rein to their ingenuity, powers of reason ing and logic. They have a logic of their own which governed not only the interpretation of Vedic passages but also of the Smartis and the medieval works on Dharmaśāstra (including law and procedure). As Colebrooke, one of the most accurate and level-headed of Western scholars of Sanskrit, said more than 130 years ago &lsquo;the disquisitions on the inimāinsā bear therefore a certain resemblance to juridical questions; and in fact, the Hindu law being blended with the religion of the people, the same modes of reasoning are applicable and are applied to the ono as to the other. The logic of the Mimansa is the logic of the law; the rule of interpretation of civil and religious ordinances, Each case is examined and determined upon and from the cases decided the principles may be collected. A well-ordered arrange ment of them would constitute the philosophy of law and this is in truth what has been attempted in the Mimadga&rsquo; (Miscella. neous Essays, Vol. I. pp. 316-317, Madras ed, of 1837).</p>
<p>The first division of Vedic material is into Mantra and Brāhmana. It has been already stated above (p. 1096 note 1776) that those are mantras that are recognized as such by the learned. P. M. 8. (II. 1. 31-32) provides 1979 that mantra is that which simply asserts (and is not hortatory ) or (to say the same thing in another way) &lsquo;those are mantras that are so called on account of their asserting something&rsquo;s On P. M. S. I 4. 1 Sabara describes mantra as one that at the time when the procedure of &amp; sacrifice is being followed, recalls or reminds or makes clear to the performer the matter that is prescribed 0.g. &lsquo;I cut (the blades of) kusa grass that is an abode for the deity&rsquo;.

Sabara remarks that laksana is the only way for the recognition of mantras and not an enumeration of some characteristics of mantras as done by the Vittikāra such as these viz. 1980 some end in &lsquo;asi&rsquo; (thou art) ortvā&rsquo; as in Tai, S. 1. 1.1 &lsquo;ise tvā&rsquo;, prayer or wish (as in &lsquo;āyurdhā asi&rsquo; in Tai. S. I. 6. 6. 1), praise (&lsquo;agnir mūrdha divaḥ&rsquo; in Tai. 8. 1V.4.4). Sabara points out that &lsquo;asi&rsquo; and &lsquo;tva&rsquo; occur even in the middle of mantras, the other characteristics such as blessing and praise are found in Brāhma ṇas also. The M. B. P. remarks that there are (p. 66) ono hundred kinds of mantras aod that if we take into account the fourteen Vedic metres and their sub-varieties there would be 273 different varieties of ?k mantras alone (p. 67). There are cor tain texts regarded as mantras (e. g. Vasantāya kapiñjalan alabhate&rsquo; Vāj. 8. 24. 20) which are not merely assertive but rather relate to the procedure of a yaga ( in the case of Vaj, 8.24, 20, of Aśvamedha).</p>
<p>Mantras are classified under three heads viz. Rk, Saman and Yajus. These are defined in P. M. S. II, 1, 35-37; the name șk is applied to those 1981 mantras that are divided into feat, metrical pādas (often) based on the meaning. Sāman is the name applied to Vedic mantras that are sung. It has been established in P. M. S: VII. 2. 1-21 and IX. 2. 1-2 that the mantra 1982 texts are not called Saman but only the musio, that</p>

<p>giti is an action which manifests various tunes owing to the internal effort made by the singer and in order to bring about the musical effect the singer has to resort to modifications of the letters of the rk, to disjunction (of parts of it), to omission (of &amp; letter), to repetition, to pauses, to 1983 stobha. In VII.2. 1-21 the PMS establishes that the words &lsquo;Rathantara-sāman&rsquo;, &lsquo;Bphat sāman&rsquo; refer only to the music and not to the rk or basic text set to music. Yajus means those Vedic mantras that are neither</p>
<p>k nor sūman. There is another word &lsquo;nigada&rsquo; applied to certain mantras that are addressed to others as directions to do certain acts and are uttered loudly such as &lsquo;agaidagain vihara&rsquo;,</p>
<p>proksapīrāsādaya, &lsquo;idhmābarhirupasādaya&rsquo;. They are Yajus (i. e, in prose), the only difference being that they are loudly uttered (in order that the persons to whom they are addressed may bear them), while ordinary Yajus is uttered inaudibly. Vide P. M. S. II 1. 38-45 for discussion on Nigadas and Mai. 8. HII, 6.5 for &lsquo;uccair-pcā kriyata uccaiḥ sāmopāmśu yajuṣā&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Mantra and Brābmapa constitute the Veda, The P.M. S. 1984 states that all those parts of the Veda that are not or cannot be called Mantra constitute Brāhmaṇa. Sabara notes that the Vettikāra, in order to enable students to decide what texts are Brāhmaṇa texts, pointed out certain characteristics found in Brāhmaṇa texts such as abounding in the word &lsquo;iti&rsquo; or &lsquo;ityāba (so it is said), anegdote, stating the reason for an injunction, etymology, condemnation, praise, doubt, injunction, instance where another did something of the game kind, what happened in</p>

<p>Vrttikāra on characteristics of Brahmana</p>
<p>1223 -</p>
<p>past ages, changing the meaning after considering the context.1985 Sabara also quotes two verses summarising under ten heads the characteristics of Brahmana texts, points out that all this is only illustrative and that the characteristics mentioned by the Vșttikāra sometimes occur in mantras also, such as &lsquo;iti&rsquo; in Rg, X. 119. 1, &ldquo;ityāha&rsquo; in Rg. VII, 41, 2, &lsquo;akhyāyika&rsquo; as in Rg. I. 116. 3, reason (hetu) in Rg. I. 2. 4. The Rgveda alone contains over ten thousand mantras. Hardly one-third of them are employed in all the Vedic rites. The rest are employed in japa. Besides, the other Vedas also have thousands of mantras, Therefore, no formal definition of mantra is attempted and all that is stated is that mantras are those which have been recognised as such by the 1986 learned.</p>
<p>Brāhmaṇas are attached to each Veda, such as the Aitareya and Kausitaki Brāhmaṇas to the Rgveda, the Taittiriya to the Krsna Yajurveda, the Satapatha to the Sukla Yajurveda, the Tāṇdya to the Samaveda and Gopatha to the Yajurveda. The Brāhmaṇas contain the oldest known specimens of probe in Indo-European languages, though prose formulas (probably earlier in date than those in the Brāhmaṇas) are found in the Kṭsṇa and Sukla Yajurveda Samhitās. They are the primary source of information about sacrifices, ritual and priests. They contain numerous myths and legends put forward for illustrating ritual and sacrifices. They often mention contests between gods and asuras (titans) and abound in etymologies. Their contents can be divided into two broad classes, viz. injunctive (hortatory ) passages (vidhis) and explanatory (or laudatory) passages ( arthavādas). The scope and purpose of arthavadas will be explained later on. But one important point to be noted is that the Mimāṁsakas are strongly opposed to holding that any part of the Voda, even the smallest, is useless or meaningless.</p>

<p>enormous extent and of greatly varied content, Once it is admitted that the Veda is self-existent and not the work of any author, bugan or divine, every sentence in it apparently becomes of infallible authority. The Veda being the only means of knowing Dharma, the Mimimsakas had to accept that whatever the Veda says was authoritative and binding on them, as Sabara 1987 admits. But many Vedic texts are apparently in conflict with each other and often are in conflict with ordinary experience. A fow striking instances may be given to show how difficulties arose. The Tai. S. V. 2.7 and Mai. S. state one ghould not pile the fire altar on (bare) earth, nor in the sky, nor in heaven&rsquo;. 1988 No one can build a fire altar in the sky, nor in heaven, The Veda apparently prohibits something which is quite impossible and therefore this prohibition seems at first sight senseless. The Tai. Br. (III. 8. 10.5) states that by offering the Pūrṇāhuti the performer secures all desired objecte. If Pārṇāhuti yields all objects, then one need not perform any further rites of Agnihotra &amp;c. Does the Veda mean this? The Veda contains stories and legends about individuals e. g. Tai, S. mentions Babara Prāvāhasi who desired to be an eloquent speaker and therefore performed &amp; sacrifice called Pancarātra and secured his object. The Veda would then be later in time than this Babara and this would forfeit the claim of being eternal &amp;o. Therefore, Sabara states that a story that never happened is described for the sake of praise. This may be an escape from a tight corner but the explanation does not redound</p>

<p>Veda and legends</p>

<p>to the credit of the Veda which is here admitted to have manufactured a non-existent story for pushing up one of its injunctions; besides, if people come to know from what Sabara says that the story is false, people would not be induced to go in for performing that rite. A true story might encourage persons to follow the prescription of the Veda in this case. The Tantravartika (p. 125) on this explanation of Sabara tries to meet the objection raised here. Sometimes Veda is divided into three portions viz. Vidhi, Arthavada and Mantra, names of yāgas like udblid and visvajit being placed under vidhi. The Ślokavārtika refers to this threefold division in its last verse. 1989 Though the whole Veda is the only means of right knowledge about what Dharma is i. e. what should be done and what should not be done, the different parts of the Veda are not all directly related to right knowledge about Dharma. Large portions of the Veda are related only mediately to the principal part. 1990 In one place Sabara very succintly but clearly defines the three classes of Vedic texts and illustrates them. The Veda is also divided into five parts viz. vidhi, arthavada, mantra, namadheya and prati ṣedha. These five have already been mentioned above. Here some details will have to be added on each of these. Vidhi is an injunction (or exhortation) that is meaningful on account of enjoining a matter that has &amp; (useful) purpose and it prescribes</p>

<p>something that does not follow (or is not established by) from any other authority. Sabara himself describes in many places what vidhi means. For example, the injunction &lsquo;one desirous of (attaining) Heaven should offer Agnihotra&rsquo; prescribes (the per- . formance of) boma that does not follow from any other authority and that has a beneficial purpose, its meaning being &lsquo;by the Agni. hotra offering one should effect (the attainment of)svarga&rsquo;, Where. however, a rite is otherwise established, all that can be done is only to enjoin an accessory with regard to it. Thus in the sentonce &lsquo;one should offer an oblation with curds&rsquo; the homa being already established by the words &lsquo;one should offer Agnihotra (if one desires heaven)&rsquo; all that is enjoined is the offering of curds with regard to it, the meaning being &lsquo;by curds one should effect the oblation&rsquo;. Vide Tup-tikā on P. M. S. VI. 3. 17 and M. N. P. p. 17 ( B.O. R. I ed.). 1991</p>
<p>The collection of vidbis in the Vedic texts forms the core of the Veda and refers to many specific rites. The central olemont in a vidhi is the verb or verbal form, which will be analysed later on. The question is: how is one to recognize a vidhi, Sabara quotes a verse which those who know the propositions about the meanings of words and sentences declare traditionally, viz. in all the Vedas the fixed (or defipite ) sign of a vidhi is the words &lsquo;one shall do&rsquo;, &lsquo;it should be done&rsquo;, &lsquo;it ought to be done&rsquo;, &lsquo;it should be so&rsquo;, it ought to be so!. 192From this it follows that a vidhi is ordinarily couched in the optative form (called vidhi ling in Sanskrit), and that a verb in the present tense cannot ordinarily be taken 48 laying down a vidhi, 1993 But sometimes a vidhi may be inferred even from a text in which the verb is in the present tense. For example, there is a vedic text occurring in the Mahāpitryajña which states he should follow holding the</p>

<p>fuelstick below the handle of the ladle in the pitryajña, since the performer of rites for the gods holds the fuel-stick above the handle. 1991 This has been construed as a vidbi (exhortation) and not as &amp; more arthayāda. Another example is that of Rātrisattras (Soma sacrifices occupying more than twelve days ). A passage in the context of Rātrisattras states those who perform rātrisattra attain stability (or fame), are endowed with brahma lustro and eat or possess food&rsquo;. This looks like a mere praise (arthavāda) of the performance of rātrisattras, but really it is a vidhi about the reward of rātrisattra mentioned in the above passage and states an exception to the rule that svarga is the reward of a rite in which no reward is specified by the Vedic. texts. This is employed in the Mit. on Yaj. III, 226 which states that the sin committed through ignorance is removed by the performance of penances. Ordinarily, a sinful act is deemed to be destroyed by undergoing the penalty that God may inflict, but Yaj. states a special rule. Medhātithi on Manu V. 40 (stating that animals, birds and herbs dying by being offered in yajñas reach higher levels) says that this is merely an arthavada and no vidhi can be imagined from this by the maxim of Rātrisattra. 1995 Vide Par, M.

<p>adhikūravidhi about one desirous of stability has been assumed from the passage about rātrisaftra. Raghupandana in Ekādi.. śitattva (p. 28) explains the sūtras (P. M. S. IV. 5. 17-19 ) and illustrates this nyaya.</p>
<p>Following the Vedas, tbe Smṛtis also lay down numerous vidbis by means of verbal optative forms or participleg ending in ya, tavya &amp;c.&rsquo;. For example, vide Manu IV.25 &lsquo;agnihotram ca jubuyat&rsquo; and XI. 53 (&lsquo;caritavyam-ato &amp;c.') as instances of the two ways. From different points of view vidhi is classified in various ways. One classification is into four, Utpattividhi (originative injunction), Viniyogaridhit (applicatory), prayoga vidhi (performance), aithikūra-ridhi (oligibility ). Utpattividhi is one which shows in a general way the nature of the rite, as in agnihotram juhoti&rsquo; (he offers the agnihotra oblation); an applicatory injunction is one which conveys the conpexion of a subsidiary matter with the main rite as in &lsquo;dadhnā juboti&rsquo; (ne offers oblation with curds) and this is dealt with in the 3rd chapter of the P. M. S.; a prayogavidhi is an injunction that governs the order of parts in a rite and suggests non-delay or promptness in the performance, though often times it is implied rather than expressly stated. This is considered in the chapters IV and V of the P. M. S. An Adhikāravidhi (injunction of qualification or eligibility ) is one that points to the ownership of the fruit of an action as in &lsquo;svargakāmo yajeta&rsquo; (he who desires to secure heaven should perform a yāga). 19% This is the subject of the 6th chapter of P.

Here there are two alternatives only and both cannot be availed of at the same time (i. e, a man cannot perform a sacrifice at the same time on even as well as on uneven ground). Therefore, same dese yajeta&rsquo; (one should offer a sacrifice on an even spot) is a niyama (it restricts the performance to flat land only) and excludes the use of uneven land for &amp; sacrifice. &lsquo;Five five-nailed animals are to be eaten&rsquo;.

<p>1230 History of Dharmatāstra (Soo, VII, Ch. XXIË word parisankhyā occurs in P. M. 8 X. 7. 4 and 7 and Sabara notes that it is liable to three faults. 1998</p>
<p>Dharmasastra writers make frequent use of the doctrine of niyama and parisankhyā. Medhātithi on Manu III, 45 (tuka. lābhigāmi syat) has a long note on niyama and parisankhya, quotes the verse of Tantravārtika and explains the passage about five five-nailed animals. The Mit. also on Yaj. on I. 79 (tasmin yugmāsu sainviset &lsquo;the husband should approach the wife on every even night next to the 4th night up to the ¡16th after her monthly illness starts) and on I. 81 holds a lengthy discussion whether there is a vidbi or niyama or parisankhya. The Mit. defines the three in prose, cites examples and tells us that some thought that there was only a parisankhyā, while Bbāruci, Viśvarūpa, and others (including the Mit.) hold that there is a niyamavidhi only in I. 79 and 81. Ap. Dh. S. II, 1. 17 deals with the same subject as Yāj. I, 79 and 81 and Haradatta says it is a niyama, while others thought it was a parisankhyā: and that in any case it is not a pure vidhi. On Gautama V.2 Haradatta comments that the ācārya (i.e. Gautama) holds that there is a parisankhyā only (the sūtra is &lsquo;garvatra vā pratisiddhavarjam &lsquo;). Compare Yaj. I. 81 (yathākāmi bhaved-vāpi &amp;c.), on which the Mit. emphatically says that in both Gautama and Yāj. there is a restriotive rule (niyama). Gautama prescribes that a brāhmaṇa should eat at the houses of persons of the three higher classes that are commended for the performance of their duties and should receive gifts also from such persons. Haradatta treats these two rules as 1999 parisankhyāvidhis, Ap. Dh. 8. II. provides the rules of conduct for husband and wife after their marriage, the first being &lsquo;taking food two times (morning and evening). Haradatta takes it as a parisankhya, meaning that eating &amp; third time is prohibited (but they may or may not eat twice in the day), while others take it as a niyama meaning they must eat twice in the day&rsquo;.</p>

<p>1, 15, 19. spatti is used i similar to sue Do other</p>
<p>Niyamavidhis are of three classes, viz. those concerned with pratinidhis ( substitutes), those about pratipatti (concluding aot or final disposal of certain materials employed in a sacrifice), and those that are concerned with matters other than the preceding two. The Tāpdya-brāhmaṇa says 2000 if one is not able to obtain the soma plant, one may extract juice from putikas&rsquo;. Jai, III, 6. 40 and VI. 3. 13-17 deal with this matter and Jai. and Sabara prescribe that if no soma plant is available in a soma sacrifice, the sacrificer should substitute pūtikas for Soma and no other substance, even if the latter bo more similar to Soma, can be used. 2001 The word pratipatti is used in several sūtras by Jai; vide IV. %. 11, 15, 19, 22). The casting into water of all utensils and things smeared with some ( such as the drogs left after Soma is extracted, the stones, two wooden boards and the post of adumbara in the midst of the sadas) at the time of the final purificatory bath (avabhrtha) in Jyotiṣtoma is said to be pratipattikarma (P. M S. IV. 2. 22). This terminology is employed in Dharmaśāstra works. Manu (III. 262-263) provides that out of the three pindas (balls of boiled rice) that are offered to the three male ancestors of the performer of $rāddha the wife desirous of a son should eat the middle pinda (meant for the paternal grandfather) and Devala provides that the piṇdas may be given to a brāhmaṇa or may be eaten by &amp; goat or a cow or cast into fire or water. 2003 (This is the pratipatti of the piṇdas according to Aparārka (on Yāj. I. 256 ) and the Sm. C. II p. 486. Vide H. of Dh, vol. IV pp. 480-481. The word pratipatti is opposed to arthakarma. For example, in Tai. 8. we read after the soma plant is bought, he gives the staff to the Maitrāvaruṇa priest&rsquo;. Here the staff had been first given to the performer (Yajamāna) at the time of Dikṣa and then transferred to the Maitrāvarupa who has several uges for it, viz. he can walk with its help in darkness, may enter water, can prevent cows and snakes from coming near him and he can</p>

This (giving of the staff) is arthakarma as opposed to pratipatti-karma. This is mentioned in Tai, S. VI. I. 4.2 (krite some maitrāvaruṇāya dandam prayacchati &amp;c.). Another example of pratipatti is the casting of the horn of the black antelope on the cūtvāla ( Tai. S. VI, I. 3.8 and PMS IV. 2. 19). PMS XI. 2. 66-68 deal with an example of arthakarma. Cremating a sacrificer when dead with his implements of sacrifice (mentioned in Tai. S. I. 6. 8. 2-3) is pratipattikarma of the implements (P. M. S. XI. 3. 34). Manu V. 167 provides that if the wife of an āhitāgni dies before him she is to be cremated with the sacred fires set up by him and with the sacrificial implements. An example of the third kind of niyama ( which is not concerned with pratinidhi or pratipatti) is &lsquo;one should take big meal, 2003 facing the east&rsquo;. A man can take food facing any direction but this restricts him to the east alone. Here no question of a pratinidhi or of pratipatti arisons.</p>
<p>Vidhis are also divided into Kratrartha (for the rite) and Puruṣārtha ( for the man) They are concerned with &lsquo;Prayukti&rsquo;. (motivating force) which is the subject of chapter IV of the PM. S. P. M. S. IV. 1. 2 defines 2001 puruṣārtha and Sabara advances three interpretations of that sūtra, one of which is &lsquo;(Puruṣartha) is that matter on doing which follows the happiness of man, as its understanding is due to man&rsquo;s desire for obtaining it (happiness) and puruṣartha (man&rsquo;s purpose) is not different (from happiness)&rsquo;, From this rather obscure and clumsy definition it appears to follow that puruṣārtha is what a man ordinarily undertakes for securing the reward of happiness, while kratvartha is that which helps in the accomplishment of purūṣārtha and does not itself directly yield any toward to the performer. All principal sacri fices like Darśa-pūrṇamāsa are included under puruṣārtha, while under kratvartha are put all those auxiliary acts that have the</p>

<p>purpose of accomplishing the principal rite itself e. g. the five 2005 prayājas that are auxiliary to the Darsapūrpamāsa are Kratvar tha, while Darbapūrṇamāsa itself is puruṣārtha. The importance of this distinction lies in this that if what is kratvartha is not followed the rite itself becomes defective, while if what is puruṣārtha is not followed, the result is that the man himself becomes blamable or sinful but the undertaking or rite does not become defective. One set of the three interpretations of P. M. 8. IV. 1. % given by Sabara is that it refers to the rules about the acquisition of wealth viz, that a brāhmaṇa should earn wealth by receiving gifts, a kṣatriya by conquest and a veibya by agriculture and the like (vide Gaut. X. 40-42, Manu X. 76-79). These are in the nature of niyamas. If the aoquisition of wealth is kratvartha and, if one acquires wealth by means other than those prescribed by the Śāstra and performs a sacrifice with such wealth, the sacrifice itself would be defective and would not yield the desired reward. But if the acquisition of wealth be puruṣārtha, then, by whatever means wealth with which &amp; yāga is to be performed be obtained, the sacrifice would not be affected. The Mit. on 2006 Yaj. II. 114 quotes a passage from Guru Prabhākara (vide note 1947) which is quoted by the Dāyabhāga also (II. 67 ) but without name, while the Sm. C. II. pp. 257-58). Madanaratna (on Vyavahāra pp. 324-325) and Vyavabāraprakāśa (p. 420) quote a similar passage from the Nayaviveka. Viśvarūpa also on Yāj. II. 144 holds that rules about acquisition of wealth are puruṣārtha&rsquo;. To acquire wealth is natural to man and acquisition of wealth does not depend upon Sastra. Besides, every one can directly perceive that wealth when earned confers pleasure on the acquirer. Therefore, wealth is puruṣārtha and sacrifices which are performed with wealth are also puruṣārtha. The general rule is that all angas ( auxiliary rites) are kratvartha and all principal rites (like</p>

<p>Darbapūrpamisa, Somayaga) are puruṣartha; all texts presori bing the rewards of rites are puruṣārtha. Some individual examples may be given.</p>
<p>In the Saṅkhāyana Br. (VI. 6) after saying that certain observances ( vrata) must be followed by the sacrificer, it is provided that he should not see the sun rising or setting. These observances are called &lsquo;Prajāpativratāni&rsquo; by Sabara, and are declared by him to be puruṣartha, the meaning being that the sacrificer should make a resolve not to see the rising or setting sun.</p>
<p>This distinction betwaon Kratvartha and Puruṣartha is often taken over into Dharmaśāstra matters. For example, Yaj. I. 53 provides that one should marry a girl who is free from diseases, has a brother and who does not belong to the same gotra or pravara as that of the bridegroom. The Mit 2007 explains that the status of being a wife does not at all arise it the girl is a sapinda or is of the same gotra or pravara as the bridegroom (i. e, marriage itself is null and void), but a girl who has some disease when married becomes a wife, the only result being that there is a visible defect (such as a diseased wife is a . constant source of anxiety and unbappiness). Kullūka on Manu IL, 7 (providing that one should not marry a girl from a family in which provail diseases like phthisis, epilepsy, white and black leprosy, refers to this doctrine of Sabara elaborated above. The Mit. on Yāj. III. 280 quotes a verse &lsquo;a wise man should not marry a girl who has no brother, por father, for fear that she may be a putrika (daughter appointed as a son).&rsquo; Here the prohibition is like the prohibition of marrying a deformed girl i. e. it is a perceptible purpose. Therefore, the marriage would be valid i. e. the prohibition is puruṣārtha. Manu says (IX. 168) &lsquo;that is known to be an adopted son whom the mother or father might give ( to another) with water in a time of distress &amp;o.&rsquo;. The Mit, on Yaj. II. 130 quotes this verse and remarks that, as the word &lsquo;distress&rsquo; is specifically mentioned, &amp; son is not to be given in adoption to another when there is no distress and that this prohibition would affect only the giver (but not the act of adoption) i, e. this prohibition would be</p>

<p>Ṛratvartha and Purugārtha distinguished 1235 puruṣārtha and not kratvartha. 2008 It may be noted that the Vyavahāramayūkba disagrees and holds that the prohibition is kratyartha. It may be said in a general way that those prescrip tions that have an invisible, spiritual or othor-worldly result or reward are kratvartha, while those that have a visible result are puruṣārtha.</p>
<p>Before proceeding further it is necessary to analyse the notions underlying the word &lsquo;yajeta&rsquo; used in such Vedic sentences as &lsquo;one desiring heaven should offer &amp; sacrifics&rsquo; (svargakāmo yajeta). In the word &lsquo;yajeta ' 2009 there are two parts viz. the root yaj&rsquo; (to sacrifice) and the termination (of injunctive third person singular). In the termination also there are two parts (elements ) viz, general verbal nature and injunctiveness (or injunctive force). General verbal nature is found in the ten lakūras (verbal formg in ton moods and tenses ), but injunctiveness is found only in the injunctive form. Both general verbal nature and injunctiveness express only bhāvanā (force that brings into being something, efficient force ). Bhāvanā (lit.) means a particular operation or activity of an agent which conduces to the coming into being of the result (Lit. which is to come into being). And this bhāvanā is of two kirds, sābdi ( word force) and arthi (result-producing force ).</p>
<p>It has been already stated that vidhia are the very core of the Veda. The doctrine of bhāvana is the very heart of vidhis and is therefore one of the most important doctrines of the</p>
<p>mimamsa.</p>
<p>In ordinary life when a person says to another this should be done by you&rsquo;, the prompting to do something comes from a person. But Veda has according to the Mimarisi no author, human or divine. Therefore, in a Vedic vidhi the promp ting arises from the injunctive or the optative form of the word; there is no person, human of divine, behind the injunotion; hence the bhāvanā is said to be sābdi (i. e. based on the word itself and not on the will or direction of a person).

<p>1986 History of Dharmalāstra i Seo. VII, Oh. XXIX fore, sabdi-bhavanā is defined as a particular operation (or aotivity) of an agent (here the word of the Voda) that conduces to the activity of a man; and it is expressed by that part or element which is optative. It is called &lsquo;śābdi&rsquo; because it is * sabdaniṣtha (centred in the word of the Veda) and not puruṣaniṣtha (centred in a person). In a śābdibhāvanā there are three elements viz. (1) there is prompting of the agent to activity. (2) the injunction is the instrument and (3) the manner is furnished by the desirableness proclaimed by artha vāda passages. The sābdi-bhāvanā gives rise to arthi-bhiyanā. In an arthi-bhāvanā ( that aims at or seeks the artha, the phala) also there are three elements viz. (1) svarga is the phala that is to be brought about, (2) the means or instrument is yaga, (3) there is also the procedure or method (itikartavyatā) of the yāga. All this is based on the P. M. S. sūtra II. 1. 1, on Sabara&rsquo;s bhāsya and certain important verses of the Tantravārtika quoted below. This whole discussion leads on to the idea of apūrra. Yāga lasts for a short time, while avarga comes to a man after death, which may be years after the performance of the sacrifice. What is the connecting link between yāga and svarga (the cause and the result)? It is the force or potency generated by yāgs that brings about svarga.</p>
<p>Briefly, the idea is; both the root and the affix together express the sense of the affix and as the bhāvanā is the prinopal element in this, it is held to be the sense of the affix. There are numerous 2010 &lsquo;bhāvaśabdas&rsquo; such as yajati, juhoti, dadati,</p>

<p>Two kinds of bhavatabdas</p>
<p>1857</p>
<p>dogdhi, pinasti. These are of two sorts, viz. pradhana (principal) and gunabhūta, 2012 Those by which a substance is not intended to be produced or embellished (or made fit) for a religious rite, are expressive of principal karma (such as prayājas ), while those which are meant to produce a substance or to make a substance fit are gunabhuła (such as pounding rice grains or chiselling a piece of wood for making a sacrificial post, wiping stuc ladle). Therefore the latter kind of actions are called gunakarma. There are two kinds of verbal forms (1) those in which the form only conveys that the kartā ( doer of the action) exists such as the forms &lsquo;asti, bhavati, vidyate&rsquo;; (2) there are others where not only there is the existence of the kartā but there is also the understanding of some activity that produces a result such as &lsquo;yajati&rsquo; (meaning &lsquo;yagam karoti&rsquo;), ' dadati&rsquo; (i. e. dānam karoti), &lsquo;pacati&rsquo; (pakam karoti), &lsquo;gacchati&rsquo; i. e. gamanam karoti). That is, in such cases the sense of karoti is also understood. Jaimini (in P. M. S. II. 1. 4) divides words into two classes viz. Namāni (nouns) and Karmasabdoh (verbs). Under the firat Sabara would include pronouns and adjectives. The 2nd is called &ldquo;ākhyāta&rsquo;. Sabara (on II. 1. 3.) paraphrases (namani as dravya-gunasabdah&rsquo; and remarks that in the sutra (II. 1. 3) the word &lsquo;nāmāni&rsquo; is employed in the sense of dravyagunasabdah ' 2012.

<p>We must now turn to the 2nd great division of Vedic texto, viz. Arthavādas. They are dealt with in P. M. S. first adhyāya, ind pāda. There are numerous Vodic passages such as &lsquo;he roared; because he roared he came to be called Rudra&rsquo; (Tai. $. I. 5. 1. 1.), &lsquo;Prajāpati cut out his own fat&rsquo; (Tai. S. II, 1. 1.4), the gods, having reached the sacrificial ground, did not know the directions&rsquo; (Tai. S. VI, 1. 5. 1.); who knows whether one lives in the other world or not &lsquo;(Tai. S. VI. I. 1. 1.); &lsquo;thore should be no piling of fire altar on the earth nor in the sky nor in heaven&rsquo; (Tai. S. V, 2.7.1). The objector says &lsquo;you have yourself declared that enjoining religious rites is the purpose of the Veda&rsquo; (P. M. S. I. 1.2). The above and similar passages do not serve any purpose in the matter of religious acts, they are therefore uselegg and are non-eternal (or do not refer to any permanent matter). The reply is that these passages form one syntactical or connected whole with hortatory passages of the Veda and they serye the purpose of commending (or glorifying) the hortatory passages. Sabara cites on I. 2. 7 the passage &lsquo;one desiring prosperity gbould sacrifice a white animal in honour of Vāyu; Vāyu indeed is the swiftest deity; he runs near Vāyu with the share proper (to Vāyu); he (Vāyu) leads the sacrificer to prosperity&rsquo;. 2011 These words form one whole passage; the first</p>

<p>1239</p>
<p>part vāyavyam,.,bhūtikāmaḥ is clearly a vidhi, as the word alabheta (in the optative form) shows. The latter portion is an arthavāda for the purpose of commendation. People are familiar with the fact that Vāyu is swift. Therefore, the latter portion (Vāyurvai &amp;c.) merely repeats what is already well known that is, it is an anuvāda). In sātras 19–25 of I. 2 the P. M. 8. considers certain passages that look like vidhis but are declared to be arthavādas. For example, (Tai 8. I. 1. 1.6) the sacrificial post is to be of udumbara wood; the udumbara wood is indeed vigour (or food or sap); cattle aro vigour; by this strong (or juicy) post, he ( sacrificer) secures cattle, for the securing of strength&rsquo;. The objector says that this is a phalavidhi (an injunctive text about a result) as the words &lsquo;ūrjosvara ddhyai&rsquo; contain the purpose and there is no word of commenda tion. The reply is that there is only commendation.</p>
<p>There are some passages in the Veda in which occur words like &lsquo;hi&rsquo; (because) such as in &lsquo;one should offer into fire the oblation with the winnowing basket, because food is prepared by means of it&rsquo; (Tai. Br. I. 6.5). 2015 The question that arises is</p>

<p>whether this and other passages containing words denoting reason should be construed as arthavadas commending what is onjoined in the preceding sentence or whether as stating &amp; reason for the injunction. The established conclusion is that they are commendatory. If the other view were adopted ( viz. that śruti gives a reason for the vidhi) then it may be argued that the ladle, pan and other utensils also may be used for making an offering (not merely the sūrpa), as they also are required in preparing food. Ragbunandana in Malamāsatattva p. 760 relies upon and explains this maxim with reference to Laghu-Harita&rsquo;s words &lsquo;cak ravat parivarteta sūryab kālavasād yatah&rsquo;.

III. 2. 5. 12) a doubt arises about the material with which pebbles are to be anointed. That doubt is removed by the remainder of the passage that it is ghee with which they are to be anointed ( P. M. S. I. 4. 24 )</p>
<p>Arthavādas are of three kinds viz. gupavāda, anuvada and bhūtārthavāda; &lsquo;when an artbavāda text is in conflict with ordinary experience it is metaphorical; when something is definitely ascertained by other means of knowledge and becomes the subject of a text it is called anuvāda and when a text is not opposed to other pramānas or is not definitely ascertained otherwise, it is called &lsquo;bhūtārthavada&rsquo; (statement of an accompli. shed fact, or of a past event); in this way arthavāda is of three kinds&rsquo;. 2016 An example of the first kind is&rsquo; during day-time</p>

<p>happened in bygone ages). 2016 Devala states that sages have laid down expiation for the first wrong, for committing a second double of that, for committing a third time thrice as much but there is no expiation for committing it a fourth time. The Prāyaścitta-prakaraṇa of Bhavadova says that this is not to be taken literally, but it is only nindārthavāda. The P. M. S. itself (VI. 7. 26 and 30 ) states that paraksti and purakalpa are arthavādas.</p>
<p>The Vyavahāra-mayūkha quotes &amp; verge of Devala 2017 on the father&rsquo;s death the sons should divide the paternal wealth, for they have no ownership as long as the father who suffers from no blemish (that deprive him of ownership) is alive&rsquo;. Here the first half lays down a time for partition (it is a vidhi), the latter half is only an arthavāda praising the vidbi and means that, as long as the father is alive, the sons are not independent and not that they have no ownership in ancestral property.</p>
<p>Smptis also abound in arthavādas. For example, Medhātithi on Manu V. 56 (na māmsabhakṣane doṣaḥ) says that from V. 28 up to V. 56 all verses except two or three are arthavādas. Medhātithi points out in several other places in the Manusmrti a few vidhis and numerous arthavādas. For example, Manu II, 117 contains a vidhi about abhitādana, while verses II.</p>

<p>118-121 are arthavādas in relation to it. In Manu II, 165 a vidhi is laid down for the study of the whole Veda by persons of the three upper classes; when Mano (X. I) again lays down that the three classes should study the Veda, this is merely an anuvāda. Medhātithi on Mapu. IX. 135 remarks that many verses in Manu contain arthavād as.</p>
<p>The Vasiṣtha-dharmasūtra and Viṣnudharmottara W18 provide that cow&rsquo;s urine, excreta, milk, ourds, clarified butter, water in which kuśas have been dipped and a fast for a day and night will purify even a svapāka. A Syapāka was the lowest amongst untouchables and followed the same avocations as a cāṇdāla and was governed by the same rules (vide Manu X. 51-56 ). This Verge is not to be taken literally, as nothing could make a . cāṇdāla touchable, Therefore, this is a more arthayāda meant to praise the purifying effects of pañcagavya and a fast.</p>
<p>It would have been noticed that every Vedic passage is not of the nature of &amp; vidhi (of an injunctive or exhortatory character). There are numerous Vedic passages that are commendatory of a vidhi, condemn an act that is prohibited, give an illustration of some one baving performed the vidhi in the past or pat forward an easily understood reason for the specifio act which is enjoined. These commendatory, condemna tory and illustrative passages are not to be treated as unnecessary or purposeless, but are to be taken along with the vidhi passages to complete their full import.. This doctrine of arthayādas savas a huge portion of Vedic texts from being neglected or treated as - unnecessary.</p>
<p>The Garudapurāṇa states &lsquo;Gāndhāri, who observed a fast on Ekadasi mixed with daśami, lost her hundred sons; therefore Ekādasi mixed with dasami should be given up&rsquo;. Here the first part is only s nindānuvada (i. e. it indirectly supports the positive rule tām parivarjayot&rsquo;), as the maxim is that&rsquo;ninda in &amp; text is not meant for the mere sake of condemnation but for prescribing the opposite of what is condemned.&rsquo; Vide.Kștyarat nākara p. 635 for this interpretation. The M. B. P. (pp. 50-58) gives another classification of arthayādas into 38 varieties. They are passed over here from considerations of space.</p>
<p>The arthavādas constitute the largest part of the Veda, particulary in the Brāhmaṇa texts. About ārthavāda the</p>

<p>Tantravārtika makes 2019 a general statement that arthavada passages coming after vidhi passages are weak, while those that come before vidhis are stronger.</p>
<p>The 3rd class of Vedic texts are mantras. They have already been treated above (vide p. 1220, notes 1979 ff.). Some mantras also lay down an injunction as in Rg. X. 117.5 &lsquo;poplyad-in nadhamānāya-tavyān&rsquo; (the strong must bestow wealth on one who begs), also the mantra &ldquo;vasantāga kapiñjalanalabhate&rsquo; (Vaj. S. 24. 20 ) cited above on p. 1221. But generally mantras are only expressive or assertive and call to mind things that are connected with the acts enjoined by vidhi-vakyas (injunotive passages ). The Tantravārtika 2020 notes that it is definitely understood that religious acts that are performed with mantras that recall to the mind the things enjoined lead to prosperity (or to srarga). The reader would notice how the Pūrvamimātisa system came to relegate mantras to a secondary place and made thom play a passive role in the sacrificial system. The Rgveda contained sublime prayers, but in the mimāṁsā system the most prominent place was given to Brāhmaṇa texts, that contained almost all the ridhis. It has been seen above pp. 950-952 how Rgveda mantras are full of faith (bhakti) in God and forvent appeals to God after confession of sin and repentance; vide Rg. VIL. 86. 4-6 ( kim-aga āga varuṇa jyestham &amp;c.); Rg. III. 39 in a hymn full of beatitude, verge 2 of which saya &lsquo;this prayer (dhih) born of yore in heaven, sung in the holy assembly with earnestDess, dressed in pure (lit-white) and auspicious garb is ours, ancient and inherited from our forefathers&rsquo; .</p>
<p>The 4th part of Vedic texts bearing on Dharma is &lsquo;Nama dheya&rsquo; (proper names of sacrifices). There are such texts as</p>
<p>• one should sacrifice with the udbhid&rsquo; (Tāpdya Br. 19. 7. 2-3), *one desirous of possessing cattle should sacrifice with citrā&rsquo; u1 (Tai. 8. IL. 4.6.1). The question is whether in these passages what is laid down is some substance to be offered in some rite ( as in</p>

<p>dadhna juhoti) or whether they are names of sacrificos. No substance is well-known as &ldquo;udbhid&rsquo; (as dadhi is a well-known substance). Citrā means a female animal of variegated colour. If it is gunavidhi (in the case of citrayā yajeta&rsquo;), there would be the fault of Vākyabheda (one sentence broken up as laying down two vidhis) i.e. the injunction would be that a female paśu was to be sacrificed (not a male) and further injunotion that its colour should be variegated. Therefore, Udbhid, Citra, Balabhid, Abhijit, Viśvajit ( Kausitaki Br. 25. 14) and Agnihot ra (P. M. 8. 1. 4. 4), Vājapoya (P. M. 8. I. 4. 6-8). Vaiśvadeva (P. M. 8. I. 4. 13-16) are names of rites and are not substances: Similarly, in &lsquo;Syonenabhicaran yajeta&rsquo; (one practising black magic for bringing about the death of an enemy may perform &amp; yāga called syona). Here &lsquo;syena&rsquo; is the name of a yāga, because the yāga swoops down upon the enemy and seizes him just as a falcon swoops down upon its victim and catches it (Şadvimga Br. III. 8. 1.3). The point to be noted is that these names gerve the purpose of 2022 particularising the meaning of what is enjoined. The Vedic text &lsquo;svādhyāyosdhyetavyaḥ&rsquo; enjoins the study of the Veda consisting of all parts including nāmadheyas of sacrifices and we directly see that in such Vedic vidhis as &lsquo;Citrayā yajeta pasukamah&rsquo; the name cifra is a part of the vidhi. Therefore, nāmadheya also is a puruṣārtha and is authoritative like other parts of the Voda (vide Sastradipika on Jai, I. 4,1). In the sentences mentioned above yāga is enjoined with the fruit as the object, since it is not otherwise established. Since it is not intended to lay down &amp; general injunction to sacrifice, a specific variety of sacrifice has to be enjoined. When one wants to know the specific variety enjoined, from the word &lsquo;udbhid&rsquo; it is known that it is the sacrifice called udbhid. Dharmaśāstra writers apply this maxim called &lsquo;Udbhid-nyāya&rsquo; to &lsquo;Upanayang&rsquo; which literally means &lsquo;taking (a boy ) near &amp;o ācārya&rsquo; (teacher of the Veda)&rsquo;.</p>

<p>History of Dharmaśāstra (Sco. VII, Ch. XXIX The fifth (and last) part of Vedic texts consists of pratiṣedha&rsquo;(niṣedha, prohibition). Prohibitions 2024 serve the enda of man by causing mon to desist from actions which would produce undesirable results. To explain, just as vidhis, which express an urge or prompting (to do something), suggest, in order to effectuate their prompting quality, that the matter to be enjoined such as a sacrifice is the means to attain a desirable result and so urge a man to do it, so also prohibitions such as</p>
<p>one should not eat Kalanja (red garlic)&rsquo; or &lsquo;one should not utter what is false&rsquo; (Tai. S. II. 5. 5.6) denote a turning away and in order to effectuate their own deterring quality, suggest that the thing to be prohibited viz. eating kalañja or speaking untruth will be the cause of bringing about an undesirable result and so make a man desist from it. The particle &lsquo;na&rsquo; may come before a verbal form, a noun or an adjective and &lsquo;na&rsquo; becomes in certain casos &lsquo;a&rsquo; (as in &lsquo;abrāhmaṇa,&rsquo; &lsquo;adharma&rsquo;) and &lsquo;an&rsquo; in certain others whon it is prefixed to a word begind ing with a vowel (as in &lsquo;anaśva&rsquo;, &lsquo;anuṣna&rsquo;). Pāṇini devotes several sūtras to &lsquo;na&rsquo; and expressly refers to &lsquo;pratiṣedha&rsquo; as one of the meanings conveyed by &lsquo;na&rsquo; (vide Pān. II. 2. 6, VI. 2. 155 &amp;c.) 2075 ; &lsquo;na&rsquo; is said to convey six senses as noted in the verge quoted below. 2026</p>
<p>The first meaning of &lsquo;na&rsquo; is &lsquo;abhāva&rsquo; (non-existence ). But that meaning would not suit all cases. When one says &lsquo;bring abrābmana&rsquo; the meaning conveyed is not non-existence&rsquo; since, if that were the meaning, one could not bring non-exist ing brāhmaṇa and so might not bring any one at all, or might</p>

<p>Meanings of &lsquo;na&rsquo;</p>

<p>bring a clod of earth which would not fulfil any purpose of the person addressing these words and therefore, on hearing this, a person not &amp; brāhmaṇa but resembling a brahmana (such as a ksatriya) is brought. So in this case &lsquo;abrāhmaṇa&rsquo; means &amp; person other than a brāhmaṇa; &lsquo;na&rsquo; also conveys the opposite (virodha) of that to which it is prefixed. It has been seen above that the verb is the main part in a sentence and in the verbal form it is the tormination that is the principal part. 80, in one must not eat kalaija&rsquo; the negative particle &lsquo;na&rsquo; must be held to be connected with the optative termination in &lsquo;bhak sayet&rsquo;. In a vidhi 20n (or on hearing a vidhi) one perceives that the sentence urges the listener to be active. When &lsquo;na&rsquo;is prefixed to an optative from it conveys the opposite of trging viz. ' nivartana&rsquo; (desisting from something). The phala that one understands from &amp; vidhi is as in &lsquo;yajeta svargakamah&rsquo; starga, while in a prohibition the phala is cessation of harm (anartha-nivrtti). The adhikari in a vidhi is one who desires gvarga; in a niṣedha the adhikari is one who is afraid of harm and desires to avoid what is undesirable. Therefore, these considerations establish that exhortation and probibition are entirely different in their import.</p>
<p>But when there is an obstacle or difficulty in construing &lsquo;na&rsquo; with the verbal termination, then it is construed with the meaning of the root. These obstacles are of two sorts; one is where the whole passage is introduced by the words his yows are * or where an option will emerge if the meaning of prohibition is stuck to. In the case of these two obstacles in sentences where</p>

IV. 1. 3) the passage starts with the words his vows aro' and then comes the sentence &lsquo;he must not see the sun irising or setting&rsquo; (Kausitaki Br. VI. 6). Vrata means a mental act, a resolve not to do a certain thing, the meaning being &lsquo;he should make a resolve to act in such a way as not to see the rising or setting sun and stick to it&rsquo;, This really is niyama (restriction). This passage does not mean that he should never look at the sun (there is no probibi. tion of seving the sun) but it only excludes the sight of the rising or setting sun; therefore, this is only exclusion and he who observes this niyama (restriction) secures the reward while in the case of eating kalanja there is a total prohibition. &lsquo;Paryudāsa (exclusion) is to be understood where the negative particle is taken with another word (i e. with the verbal root or a different word such as a noun); probibition is to be understood where the negative particle is taken with the verbal form&rsquo;,</p>
<p>In Dharmaśāstra works, &lsquo;na&rsquo; is frequently explained as laying down a paryudāsa (proviso or exception). In the section on the duties of a smūtulu in Yāj. I. 129-166 &lsquo;na&rsquo; occurs very often. The Mit. explains (on Yaj. I. 129) that in this section wherever na' occurs it is meant to denoto a paryudāga (sarva trāpi asmin snatakaprakarane nan-sabdaḥ pratyekam paryudi sārtha eva), To take only one example, Yaj. in I. 132 provides that one should not speak (to a man or woman) what would be painful without any necessity or cause. This does not altogether prohibit speaking what is painful; what it means is that a snūtaka may say to another what is painful except when there is no proper reason nor proper oocasion to do so. One may have to speak what is painful to an erring son or friend or near relative. Aparārka (pp. 206-207) quotes two well-known</p>

<p>verses on the distinction between paryudāsa and pratizedha (the two balvos of whioh are quoted and underlined in nota 2027) on the interpretation of a verse requiring a man having a son not to observe a fast on certain days &amp;c. The first halves of those verses aro; &lsquo;Pradhanatvam vidbauyatra pratigedhespradhā Datā (paryudāsaḥ&hellip;nan) || aprādhānyam vidhau yatra pratizedbe pradhānatā prasajyaprati&hellip;mañ&rsquo;.ll</p>
<p>When the particle &lsquo;da&rsquo; is employed in a sentence, it is either &amp; prohibition or a paryudāsa or an arthavada, These three have to be clearly distinguished.) In Darsapūrpamāsa the two ajyabhāgas are an anga (P. M. S. IV. 4. 30) and &amp; passage states that the two ajyabhāgas are the eyes of the Darsapūrpamāsa saorifice. 1029 In connection with this the Veda says these two are not performed in an animal sacrifice nor in a Soma sacrifice'. The question is; is this a prohibition a &amp; paryudāsa or an arthavāda. A pratiṣedha occurs only when there is the possibility of what is prohibited following as a matter of course. As the ājyabhāgas are prescribed in Darśapā roaṁāga there is no possibility of these two being required in a Somayāga and there is no real prohibition. Nor is there paryudāsu, for if it be a paryudāda there would be no proper connection, since in paryudāsa one would have to say there are ājyabhāgas in darśapūrṇamāsa except in somayāgs', which would be absurd. Therefore, these words &lsquo;na tan paśau karoti na some&rsquo; contain an arthavāda. A true 180 prohibition would occur only when something is first prescribed and then prohibited. The stock example is of the Sodasin cup; there are two Vedic sentences of equal authority he takes the sodasin oup in Atiratra' and he does not take the ṣodasin cup in atirātra'; owing to this conflict an option is allowed. Similarly, there is a Vedic passage Vrihibhir yajeta yayairyā' (one shall offer a. sacrifice with grains of rice or with yavas). Therefore, in the above two cases where the two texts are irreconcilable, there is</p>

<p>no way except that of allowing an option (vikalpa). But</p>
<p>vikalpa' is liable to eight faults. 2031 Therefore, an effort has to be made to avoid option and accept as far as possible a paryu dasa or arthavāda, since by accepting an option, the authorita tive statement in one case or the other has to be regarded as unauthoritative and not binding. Sabara and Tantravārtika provide that vikalpa should be resorted to only in case there is no other way. The P. M. S. lays down that vikalpa may be accepted when several things having the same object (or sense) are stated by several authoritative texts.</p>
<p>There is one more word that must be explained, viz. mityānuvāda. 2032 This word occurs in Āpastambadharmasūtra II, 6. 14. 13 (vide n. 1877 above). It occurs frequently in Jaimini ( vide II. 4. 26, IV. I. 5, VI. 7. 30, VII, 4.5, VIII. 1. 6, IX. 4, 36, X. 2.38 ) and Sabara uses it oftener still. He explains that where the Vedic text apparently prohibits something when there is no possibility of what is prohibited as happening, there is nityānu vāda ( as in the fire altar should not be piled on bare earth nor in the sky nor in heaven'). The Tupṭikā states the same thing in &amp; different form when it says that where a prohibition amounts to an arthavada, that is nityanuvāda.</p>
<p>Vikalpas (options) are grouped under three headṣ viz. those indicated by logio or reasoning, (2) those due to express words and (3) those dependent on the will of the performer. Au example of the first kind is the option about rice grains and barley grains (yavair yrihibhir-vā yajeta). The 2nd may be exemplified from Manu III. 267, which says that the Manos derive satisfaction for a month whon offerings are made of sesame or of rice or of barley or of māsa pulse or of water or of fruits and roots.</p>

The latter part of this passage gives an option as to āśramas.' This option is referred to by Gautama in the words some sages allow an option as to asramas to him (to brahmacārin).' When Yāj. I. 14 provides that the Upanayana of a brāhmaṇa boy may be performed in the eighth year from conception or from birth there is an option depending on the will of the father.</p>
<p>Manu IV.7 provides that a dvija should amass as much corn as would fill a granary (i. e. as would last for a year) or a Kumbhi (for six months) or as much as would suffice for three days or may not care to amass oven for to-morrow. These are four options and then Manu IV. 8 provides that a dvija who is an householder may choose one of these four, but each sucoeed ing one is superior in point of merit and otherworldly rewards.</p>
<p>A vikalpa may also be vyavasthita (restrioted or limited to a certain set of circumstances) or avyavasthita (not restricted). The Āp. Dh.

It should be noted that the eight faults about accepting an option do not occur in a vyavasthita 2035 vikalpa nor do they apply where the option is dependent on the volition of the performer nor where option is given by express texts.

<p>Sastra is meant to give definite rules as stated by Patañjali 2036 and therefore all Sastrik works try to reduce options to the minimum and assign to apparently conflicting passages separate and definite provinces of application (Visayjavyavas thā). Sometimes, the options are so many that commentators give up the task of assigning thein different scopes e. g, the Mit. on Yaj.

<p>Ārādupakdraka and Sannipatyopakūraka 1253 from Parasara, Satatapa, Vasigths and Atri gives up the effort to bring order because it would be of no use 89 people do not acoopt the diota of these in practice.</p>
<p>Two other words require some explanation. They are arādupakiraka&rsquo; and &lsquo;sannipatyopakāraka&rsquo;. In the 3rd chapter of the PMS the author deals 2037 with seṣa, its definition and explains how to determine what things are called śeṣa and what are seṣin Kumārila sets out five definitions of the word sesa, discards four and accepts one, viz. &lsquo;ßoṣa&rsquo; is that which serves the purpose of another, Sabara comments that what serves to help another is called śeṣa and the other is called seṣin Sabar&amp; adds &amp; qualification viz. that is seṣa which is of very much help to another. Bādari holds that there are three groups of sesa viz. dravya (materials for sacrifice such as rico-grains), guna (such as the reddish colour of the cow that is · the price of the soma to be purchased), sainskāras (purificatory acts such as the pounding of the grains in mortar and pestle which make the grains fit for turning them into purodāśa ). Jaimidi adds that ritos (karmāpi) like yāga, fruit or regult (of gāga) are sesa as regards the performer and the performor is śesa with reference to the yāga. According to Bādari, drapya, guna, sanskāra are always seṣa, while according to the establi shed conclusion, yāga, reward and performer (Vāga, phala and puruṣa) may be according to circumstances either sosa or sesin, After a long discussion the Tantravārtika sumg up the discussion that dravya, guṇa, and samskāra are with reference to yāga invariably sasa, though they may be seṣin with reference to their own constituent elements, while 88 regards phala, vāga and the performør they can be both śoṣa and beṣin with reference to each other. For example, in the Darga-Pūrṇamāga sacrifice there are various items, such as taking out handfuls of rice grains (for sacrifice), sprinkling water on them, pounding then; then cortain acts are to be performed with reference to ajya (clarified butter) viz. purifying it with two blades of kuta grase, melting it, also bringing a branch, starting the cows towards the meadows &amp;c. Those auxillarles are of two kind, viz (i) that are already sccomplished, (ii) that are of the nature</p>

<p>of actions. The first comprehend substances, number &amp;0.; those that are of the nature of acts are two-fold viz. sannipatyopakūraka and ārād-upakāraka. In the Paurpatāsi rite there are such auxiliaries as Prayājas, the Aghāras, the Ajyabhāgas. These are ārādupakāraka. Sannipatyopakārakag are also called sama Vāyika, or aśrayikarmāpi; they are such as the pounding of grains, prokṣına etc. The Arādupakāraka &amp;re 2038 rites presori. bed without being meant to do something about substances and are directly the angas of the principal rite. These do not give rise to any samnskāra (embellishment or making fit) in the substance meant to be offered in sacrifice, are helpful in producing the paramāpūrva that yields the fruit of the whole rite. They produce a subordinate apūrva of their own. They are directly angas of the principal rite and are distinguished from sannipatyopakārakas, which are samskāraka (bring about some embellishment or fitness). The Sannipatyopakārakas are more powerful than Ārādupakārakas and therefore the Tantra Vārtika states the proposition that where it is possible to hold an act 2039 in a rite to be sandipatyopakāraka or sāmayayika, it is not proper to regard it as ārādupakāraka. It is somewhat remarkable that Prof. Keith in his &lsquo;Karmamimāṁsā&rsquo; (p. 88) inverts the meaning of these two words. The explanation of sanni patyopakāruka in ‘Prābhākara School&rsquo; (by M. M. Jha) p. 181 also is rather obscure. The Ekādasitattva (p. 97), while discussing the substitutes (pratinidhis) to be employed on Ekādaśī for ghee, for milk and honey ( being milk-powder, curds and jaggery) quotes P. M. S. VI. 3. 18 &lsquo;na devatāgnisabda kriyam-anyārthasaryogāt&rsquo;, explains that in place of a pro scribed kriyā like prayājas (that have an unseen or spiritual reward) there is to be no substitute, since what has an invisible result is āradupakāraka, but in place of rice grains ( that are the means of preparing purodaśa ) &amp; substitute may be employed; since the rice grains are sannipatyopakārakas and have a been purpose viz. preparing purodaṣa.

VIII. 77. 4) about which it is argued that no sense can be made out of them are really explicable with the help of Nirukta (etymology) and grammar, that some words like &lsquo;Kikata&rsquo;, &lsquo;Naicātākha&rsquo;, and &lsquo;Pramaganda&rsquo;, that are claimed to refer to a country, &amp; city, a king and therefore are claimed to make the mantra (Rg. III, 53. 14) non-eternal, can be explained in a different way. In this way, no part of the Veda is anarthaka (without sense or useless ) or non eternal.

<p>23, 135. 22 in Citrao ed.) mentions Dharmasastras and Anuśās anaparva ( 45. 17) quotes gathis from Yama&rsquo;s Dharmasastra. Therefore, Jaimini had to consider whatbor smrtis and usages wore authoritative in the matter of Dharma and, if so, to what extent. Even if smrtis wore held to be unauthoritative, the authoritativeness of the Veda would not be affected; but the very first sūtra ( of P. M. S.) postulated that the work would consider the question about the characteristios of Dharma and, therefore, startis that were called Dharmaśāstra (Manu II. 10) were connected with the discussion about Dharma. Besides, from VI. 7.6 it follows that2013 Jaimini know Dharmaśāstras as he provide es that in &amp; Viśvajit the performer cannot make a sūdra &amp; subject of gift simply because he serves a man of higher caste on account of the ordinances of Dharmaśāstra. Even in the Upani ṣads (as in Tai. Up. 1.11) the teacher after the pupil had completed Veda study impresses upon the latter that whenever he would have a doubt about the rites enjoined or about propor conduct he should follow the conduct of brahmanas in his country that act after proper consideration, that are devoted to their duties and are not driven to do anything by another, are not harsh of character, that are intent on doing their duties.

On VI.8.23 he quotes one quarter of a sloka as smrti (smaranti-taṣu kaleṣu daivāni-iti). On VI. 7. 31 he says that smrti speaks of gandharvas living for a thousand years. On VI. I, 20 Sabara says a woman owns no wealth, if one followe smrti, but is owner of property if śruti be followed. On IX. 2. 2 Sabara says &lsquo;naisa smptib pramāṇam, dçstamālā hyeṣa &lsquo;; on X. 1.36 Sabara says that from the usage of respectable people smrti is inferred and from smrti Sruti text is inferred; on X.

In one place Sabara employs the words pramāpāyām emptau&rsquo; instead of &lsquo;pramāpe smftau&rsquo; as one would expect and the Tantravārtika is at great pains to show that this lapse on the part of Sabara may be somebox justified (pp. 183-184) on 1. 3. 3. The Baudhayana Dh. 8. (1.1, 19–26 ) sets out five practicas peculiar to the countries of the South (Southern India) and five others peculiar to the North and says that if one belonging to the South follows any of the usages peculiar to the North and vice versa he would be guilty of sin, Vide H. of Db.

<p>discarded, since smrtis were composed by men (i. e. they are pauruçeya and not apaurugeya, as the Veda is) and men are often deluded and forgetful. This is the main basis of the objector. To this the reply is that for prescriptions of the smtpis, there are passages in the Veda that suggest some of the smrti rules 8. g, that the Astakā srāddha was provalont long before the smrtis is indicated by the Vedic mantra &lsquo;yām janaḥ pratinan danti&rsquo;. 2046 The Usages about obeying the teacher, about provid ing cisterns for travellers have a seon purpose, viz. the benefit of others. Even the Veda mentions prapā (Rg. IX. 4.1 &lsquo;dhanya nniva prapā asi meaning&rsquo; O Agnil thou art like a prapā in a desert&rsquo;. The Tantravārtika is most exhaustive on this and the following sūtras, differs from the Bhāṣyakāra in many places, finds fault with him and gives alternative matters as the subjects for discussion. He puta forward two theories about smrti provisions for which it is impossible to suggest Vedic indications. He says (firstly) that Smrti 2017 prescriptions may be based on lost Vedic sākhas, or(2) they may be based on texts contained in the very parts of the Voda that are available at present. If any one asks &lsquo;bow is it that they are not found&rsquo;, Kumārila gives the reply: the several branches of the Veda are soattered about (in many distant territories ), mon are negligent, and the texts are contained in different sections of the Voda; on account of these one cannot point out the texts that are the basis of the emptis,</p>
<p>That many Vedic texts were lost or are unavailable now was the view even before the days of the Ap. Dh. 8. (I, 4. 12. 10), which states ‘rites were promulgated in the Brāhmaṇa texts, but the exact words of the Brābmana texts) are lost and have to be inferred from the performance of the rites (or from procedure presoribed in Smrtis). 2048 There was danger in relying on the</p>

<p>theory that Smrtis were based on Vedic texts that are lost (or disappeared ), because that very argument might be urged by heterodox sects like the Bauddhas. 2049 Therefore, Kumārila put forward the other theory viz. the basis of smṛtis are texts that are not found in the existing vedic texts because the Vedic sūkhās are scattered about (as said in the verse quoted above).</p>
<p>This whole subject about Smrtis according to the views of the Mimamsakas has been dealt with at great length by the author in H. of Dh. vol. II, pp. 827-841. Therefore, only a few examples and conclusions may be mentioned here. Sabara himself proposes that PMS I. 3. 4 2050 should form a separate Adhikarana by itself and puts forward an important maxim viz. where one can find out or ascribe a visible motive for an act one should not postulate an unseen Vedic text or a transcendental motive. 2051 The result of Sabara&rsquo;s dealing with PMS I. 3. 3-4 is neatly put by the Sāstradipikā as follow; Smṛti rules that are opposed to Śruti rules and such smrti provisions as can be shown to bave a clear worldly motive are not authoritative or binding, while the rest of smrti texts are authoritative. This doctrine is older than the Ap. Dh S. (1. 4. 10. 12) which provides &lsquo;where men act because they find pleasure in doing that act there Śāstra has no scope&rsquo;. Kunıārila does not agree with Sabara. He says that visible and invisible or spiritual motives are often inextricably mixed up. &ldquo;Unbusking rice grains&rsquo; has a visible purpose in order that they may be well boiled and the boiled rice may be offered in a sacrifice. In this act then there is a visible purpose and get this act is prescribed by the Veda. In a trenchant, finely worded and very accommodating passage redolent of a cosmopolitan outlook and the desire to give avon the devil his due, Kumārila examines (in pp. 166-168) all the known classes of Sanskrit works with regard to their usefulness</p>

<p>and relation to Veda and ordinary worldly experience. Only a few sentences will be set out here and in the notes. Therefore, he provides that all Smrtis are authoritative according to the pur pose they servex Those parts of Smrtis that are concerned with Dharma and Moksa have the Veda as their source, while what over parts of Smstis are concerned with wealth (artha) and worldly pleasures ( kūma) are based on worldly practices. The same rule applies to the hortatory passages of Itihāsa (the Mahābhārata) and Purāṇas, both of which are often spoken of as Smṛti. The episodes and tales in these two should be taken ag arthavādas. Then he refers to the descriptions of the divisions of the earth and the vamsas (dynastio lists) (both of which are among the subjects treated of in the Puranas) and sets out the purposes they might serve. The six Vedāngas (grammar, metrios, etymology, astronomy &amp;c.) are useful as kratvartha and puruṣārtha, and Mimārgā and Nyāya (logic) have been establi- - shed (worked up) from worldly experience by means of pratyaksa (direct perception) and inference based upon the technique evolved by a continuous and unbroken line of learned mon; that no single person would have been able to put together for the first time such a large collection of arguments 2052 (as in the Mimāṁsāśāstra ). For the necessity of Nyaya ( in the interpreta tion of the Veda) he relies upon Manu XII. 105–106. Kumārila ig prepared to concede that philosophical systems in which aro postulated pradhāna and puruṣa (Saṅkhya) or the supremo Lord or atonas (Vaiseṣika) should be deemed to explain the creation and dissolution of the world, should be looked upon as exhibiting perceived, minute and gross substances divided into causes and effects due to the knowledge derived from mantras and arthavādas. The purpose of these is to make known the distinction of svarga and yāga as result and cause. The purpose of the description of creation and dissolution is to show the</p>

<p>distinction between the power of luok and human effort. He goos even a step further and is prepared to admit that even heterodox hypotheses of Bauddhas such as the theory that only Vijñana (cognition) exists, that everything is in an eternal flux and that there is no (permanent) soul, whicb (theories) sprang from the arthavada passages in the Upaniṣads, &lsquo;serve the purpose of inducing people to give up extreme attachment to sensual pleasures and are useful and authoritative in their own ways.</p>
<p>He sums up the distinction by stating that as regards those smrtis (or portions of them) in which the fruit or result promised cannot possibly be experienced in this life, but where the result is promised as fructifying in the remote future (i. o. after death), an inferenco as to their being based on Veda may be drawn, but, as in the case of scorpion lore 2013 (i. e. incantations for curing the sting of a scorpion), works dealing with matters that can be seen are authoritative only because the result can be perceived in other men similarly stung.</p>
<p>The medieval Dharmaśāstra works take up this discussion about the distinction between smṛtis based upon the Veda and those on perceptible motives or purposes. For example, the Kalpa taru (Brahma-cari-kāṇda p. 30) and Aparārka (pp. 626-627) quote verses from Bhavisyapurāṇa (Brāhmaparva chap. 181, 22-31) that divide the contents of smrtis in five categories and exemplify that division. The Sm. C. II. p. 24 quotes two of those and the Paribhāṣāprakāśa of Mitramiśra (p. 19) quotes all of them, Vide H. of Dh. Vol. III, p. 840 note 1634 for all the verses.</p>
<p>Kumārila (pp. 194–196 of Tantravārtika) holds that the passages quoted by Sabara on 1. 3. 3 are not really opposed to Veda at all and that the proper subject for discussion under I. 3. 3–4 is the authoritativeness in matters of Dharma of the schools 2054 of Saṅkhya, Yoga, Pasupata, Pāñcarātra and Sakyas</p>

<p>and he holds that all these are outside the pale of the three Vedas and are to be disoarded as unauthoritative, although they contain a few mattors such as ahimsa, truthfulness, self-control, charity and compassion, that agree with śrubi and smrti. It will have been seen from the above that Kumārila was aware of the emphasis placed by Buddhists on some moral values but he differed from them in many other matters, that he was ready to admit that Buddhist works had some value and he did not preach that they should be burnt or destroyed. Therefore, it appears that his attitude was far from being one of total hatred and persecution of the Buddhists, as alleged by Taranatha cited above on p. 1010 n. 1645.</p>
<p>Sabara explains that sutras 5-7 of P. M, S, I. 3 are 2055 concerned with certain religious acts such as ācamana (sipping water) when one Breezes in the midst of 8 rito, the wearing of . Yajõopayita (the sacred thread), the use of the right hand alone in all acts. These interfere with the sequence and quick performance of the subordinate items in a religious rite, says the objector. Sabara establishes that there is no substance in the objection Kumārila feels that Sabara is not right as regards the three instances cited by him. He splits the three sūtras into two adhikaranas (topics for consideration); sūtras 5 and 6 deal (aco, to Kumārila) with the contention that those precepts of Buddha and other founders of unorthodox sects, such as the construction of monasteries and parks, the insistence on desirelessness ( vairāgya), the continuous practice of meditation, ahimsa, truthfulness, restraint of senses, charity and kindness are such as are laid down also by the Veda, are not opposed to the ideas of sistas and cannot rouse the antipathy of those who know the Vedas and that therefore those parts of the unorthodox systems should be deemed to be authoritative. This contention is ropelled by Kumarlla with the remark that only 14 (four Vedas, 6 Vedāógas, Purāṇas, Nyāya, Mimārsā and Dharmaśāstra ) or 18 (adding four Upavedas) have been accepted by the Vedic śiṣtas as authoritative in matters of Dharma and the works of Bauddhas, and other sects are not included therein. 2056 Kumārila gives &amp; telling example viz. milk, though by itself pure and useful,</p>

<p>Kumārila holds that sutra 7 of PMS I. 3 is an adhikarana by itself and is concerned with the authoritativeness of sadācāra ( the customs and usages of sistas). His position as elaborated in the Tantravārtika is that those usages alone are authoritative that are not opposed to express Vedic texts, that are practised by śistas under the belief that they are right conduct (dharma) and for which no visible motive ( such as pleasure or the satisfaction of desiros or the acquisition of wealth) can be predicated. Sistas are only those that perform the religious ritos and duties expressly enjoined by the Veda. The practices traditionally handed down from generation to generation that are observed by &ldquo;sistas (as defined above) with the conviction that they form</p>
<p>part of Dharma must be regarded as Dharma and as leading to heaven. The Tantravārtika remarks that practices do not become authoritative merely by the fact that no visible motive or purpose can be postulated for them; but they become so only when they are observed by śistas as part of Dharma. 2057 Many activities such as agriculture, service or trade, that are the means of securing wealth and pleasures and such actions 28 eating sumptuous food, drinking, sleeping on soft beds, possoso ing a charming house or garden, all of which are common to Āryas and Mlecchag are not deemed by any one to be part of Dharma and it does not follow that because a few actions of śistas are accepted as Dharma, all their actions are to be looked upon as Dharma. Kumārila quotes the advice that a man should follow the path by which his father, grand-father and other ancestors went, provided it is the path of the good, follow ing which he will not come to harm. 2058</p>
<p>Very intricate questions arise with regard to the relative force of śruti (Veda), smrti and sadācāra (usages observed by śigtas as defined above and in Manu XII, 109). The Mit. on Yāj. 17 (laying down five sources of Dharma viz. śruti, smrti,</p>

Therefore, in case of conflict between śruti and smrti the former prevaila There are a fow exceptions oven to this olear rule which may be illustrated later on. But where two smptis are in conflict, the ordinary rule, following the Sodasi-nyāya and the words of Gautama I 5 (Tulyabalavirodhe vikalpah), should be an option. Many works on Dharmaśāstra must have been composed long before 500 B. C., since Gautama mentions Manu (in 21.7) and &lsquo;acāryāḥ&rsquo; (in 3. 35, 4. 18) and Ap. Dh. 8. (I. 6. 19. 2-12) mentions no less than nine individual authors&rsquo; cpinions on the single question as to whose food may be eaten. Manu ( in IL 16) montions three views held by four sages on the position of a brāhmaṇa who marries a śūdra wife or has a son or child from her. A striking example of a conflict between smrtis is the rule of Manu (III. 13), Baud. Dh. 8. I. 8. %, Viṣnu Dh. 8. 24. 1-4, Vas. I. 25, Pār. Gļ. L. 4 allowing anuloma marriages and permit ting a brāhmaṇa to have a gūdra woman as &amp; wife and the emphatio statement of Yāj. I, 56-57 that it does not agree with those that declare that persons of the three higher classes oan take a śūdra woman as wife. Later writers of smrtis and nibandhas should have said that on account of this conflict there is an option. But they do not say so. They struck upon vari ous devices to wriggle out of such apparent contradictions. The first device was declared by Bphaspati (about 500 A. D.) that the Manusmrti oocupies a pro-eminent position as it correct ly represents the songo (the real view) of the Vedas and that a smrti which is opposed to the teaching of Manu is not held in esteem. 2039 But this was not satisfactory and some other devices wore resorted to. One was to insert passages in Manusmrti itself and in other works opposing what had already been declared as the law. Two examples may be oited. As against Manu III, 13 (referred to immediately above ) we find in the extant text (III. 14–19 ) verses very strongly condemping persons of the three</p>

These contra.. dictory statements were known to Bṛhaspati who expressly says that Manu permits niyoga and himself forbids 2060 it and assigns &amp; reason viz. that in former ages (Kșta and Tretë) people practised tagay and were endowed with knowledge while in the Dvāpara and Kali ages men have lost the powers possessed by men of the past ages and therefore niyoga is forbidden. Yājñar valkya himself proposes (11. 21) that when two smrtis are in conflict &lsquo;Teasoning baged on the practices of elders was of greater force&rsquo;. Nārada has a similar rule. 2061 Another device was to declare that the nature of Dharma differed in each of the four yugas and that in the krta, tretā, dvāpara and kali ages the Dharmas respectively promulgated by Manu, Gautama, Saṅkha-Likbita and Parāśara were to provail. 2062 įThis also could not solve all difficulties, since medieval commentators and digests found that even what was allowed by Parāśara (such as permitting a brāhmaṇa to eat food at the 2463 house of such sūdras as his dada, cowherd, barber, family friend and &amp; cultiva: tor of his land for a half share of the crops, permission for a married woman to re-marry in certain circumstances), came to be disapproved of or condemned by people. | Another expedient in cases of conflict among smrtis was provided by Gobhila viz. where there is a conflict of ( smrti) passages, the opinion of the majority should prevail. 2067</p>

<p>Long period of ihe composition of smrtis</p>
<p>1267</p>
<p>As shown above smrtis had been composed before 500 B. C. and they continued to be compiled till about 900 or 1000 A. D. 1. e. for over 1500 yeara. Yāj. (I. 4-5) mentions 19 smrtia including his own. Vide H. of Dh. Vol. I. pp. 132-135 for the enumeration of different numbers of smṛtis in different works. At least a hundred smrtis if not more can be named. During the long period of over 1500 years vast changes in the religious and social ideas of the Indian people, in their customs and usages had occurred. Buddhism arose, flourished and disappea red from India, the caste system became rigid in the matter of food, marriage and social behaviour; Vedic ritos, divinities worshipped and languagó underwent great transformations, animal sacrifices, though occasionally performed, had ceased to be looked upon as meritorious. The religious literature had therefore to be recast to suit new ideals, new worship and new patrons (viz. the common people who had coased to follow ancient ritual and worship). Smptis reflected the changes in ideas, beliefs, worship and usages that occurred from time to time and naturally gave rise to great conflicts among them selves. At last it appears that the learned men of the 10th and following conturies of the Christian era hit upon the plan of providing that certain customs and practices, though formerly allowed and practised, were harmful in the Kali age. A theory was put forward that great sages came together at the beginning of the Kali age and declared that certain ribes, customs and usagos, though allowed in past ages, should be prohibited in the Kali age. 2065 The actions prohibited or to be avoided in the Kali age (about 55 in number and therefore called Kalivariya) have been set out and discussed at length in H. of Dh: VOL II. pp. 926-967. It is clear from Medhātithi&rsquo;s bhāṣya on Manu (IX. 112) that long before his time (9th century A. D.) there were writers who had condemned govadha (in Madhuparka &amp;o.). niyoga and the giving of a larger share to the eldest son and expressed the view that those practices were only allowed in bygone ages.</p>

<p>the offering of the anubandhya cow (after avabhrtha) in Jyoti stoma and of the allotment of the largest share (of ancestral wealth) to the eldest son. All these three were either enjoined or permitted by the Veda. From Rg. X. 40.2 it follows that &amp; sonless widow raised a son for the sake of the spiritual benefit of her husband&rsquo;s soul by sexual intercourse with the husband&rsquo;s brother. 2066 The Tai. 8. (III. 1. 9. 4) has two contradictory passages viz. &lsquo;Manu divided his wealth among his sons&rsquo; (with out making any distinction among them) and therefore they endow the oldest son with (the paternal) wealth&rsquo; (Tai. S. II, 5. 2. 7). In this last case it may be argued that as two Vedic passages are in conflict there is an option. But from very early times there is a prohibition against allowing the whole ances tral wealth or a major portion of it to the oldest son. Apastamba quotes both 2057 Vedic passages, holds that equal division among sons is the proper rule and remarks that allowing the eldest son to take the whole or a major portion of ancestral estate is pro hibited by the Sastras. Among actions forbidden in the Kali age but practised in Vedic times some striking ones (apart from the three already cited above) may be mentioned here: (1) being initiated for Sattras (which were sacrifices extending from 1% days to 12 years or even more and which could be performed by brāhmapas alone ); Jaimini 2068 deals with them at some length in</p>
<p>VI. 6. 16–32 and other places. It is remarkable that neither Sabara nor Kumarila says anything against Sattredikṣā as prohibited in Kali. So it was not among generally recognized Kalivarjyas till at least the 8th century A. D. (2) killing of a cow or bull. There were several occasions on which this was</p>

But that does not appear to be correct. Maou (IX. 65) states that niyoga la nowhere mentioned among the mantras relating to marriage nor is the remarriage of a widow referred to in the procedure of marriage. But Gautama and some other sūtrakāras aod even Yaj. (1. 68-69 ) prescribe in detail the procedure and conditions governing oiyoga ; all writers are entirely silent about the procedure of the re-marriage of widows. Therefore, it has to be said that Rg.

As flesh-eating came to be looked down upon, cow-sacrifices became most abhorrent and medieval Kallvarjya texts only register a prohibition which had been acted upon for centuries before them. (3) The employment of cups of wine in the Sautrāmaṇl sacrifice. 2069 Jaimini, Sabara and the sup-tikā of Kumārila describe it and both Sabara and Kumārila refer to the offering of cups of wine in it. Therefore this rite must have become Kalivarjya after Kumārila&rsquo;s day. (4) Offering an animal with the recital of Vedic mantras to the bridegroom, to a guest and in honour of pitys. Vide H. of Dh. Vol. II, pp. 542-546 for Madhuparka in which a bull or a cow was offered according to the Ait. Br. and Vol. II, pp. 945-46 for this Kalivarjya. Manu (V. 41-44) allows the killing of animals in Madhuparka, in sacrifices and in rites for the pitrs (Manes) and gods and emphasizes that sacrificing an animal as laid down by the Veda is no hiñsā but is ahiinsa. Yāj. (1. 258-260) prescribes the periods of time for which pitrs are gratified by the offering of sacrificial food (such as rice or sesame), various kinds of fish and the flesh of several animals.

<p>said that changed ciroumstances required that the words of the Veda or of the old smṛtis should not be followed. And there is nothing novel or revolutionary in saying this. Both Manu 2071 and Yājāavalkya prescribe that one should not observe but give up, what was (once) deemed to be dharma, if it had become hateful to the people and if it would end in unhappiness and not lead to the attainment of heaven. Even the Mitākṣarā follows this precept of the two smrtis and expressly says that unequal distribution (at partition) of ancestral wealth, though found in the Śāstras, should not be followed because people had come to hate it. It may be noted that the word used by Yāj. and others is &lsquo;lokavidvista&rsquo; or &lsquo;lokavikrusta&rsquo; (hated or reviled by the people) and not sista-ridvista&rsquo;, the idea being that even if orthodox learned pandits insist that people must follow what the Veda and smrtis declare to be Dharma, common people way give up practices condemned by them or hateful to them. This attitude recognizes the historical facts that practices change in the course of centuries and common people are entitled to ignore the diota even of the Veda (much more of the smrtis).

I. 156 (by oversight it ascribes the verse to Manu). In modern times when any change or reform in religious or social practices is suggested, Pandits calling themselves Sanātanis put forward the pleas that the proposed change or reform is opposed to the sāstras, that the controversy should be carried on according to the Mimāmsā rules, that all Smṛti and other diota should be so construed as to lead to samanvaya (consistent arrangement of apparently discordant texts), that the historical approach leads nowhere and should not be resorted to. All these objections are hero briefly dealt with. It has been shown how from Vedic times to the present day great changes have taken place in religious ideas, worship and practices, how emptis from Gau tama, Apastamba, Manu downwards espouse conflicting views Bo much so that as early as the Mahabharata Vyāsa 2077 had to protest that &lsquo;rationalisation is unstable, Vedas are in con flict with each other, there is no single sage whose opinion is held to be authoritative (by all), the truth about Dharma is enveloped in a cave (i. e. it cannot be clearly discerned) and that therefore the path (to be followed) is the one followed by the great mass of people.&rsquo; The Mimāmsā does not often lead to certain conclusions and it has already been seen how great Mimāṁsā writers like Sabara, Kumārila, Prabhākara differ among themselves on numerous topics and it would be further illustrated later on how even great Mimāṁsakas evolve highly conflicting conclusions in the interpretation of simple smrti passages. Change is the one absolute in the long history of our religious and social ideas and what those who appeal to the historioal approach mean is that the smftis were composed by human authors during a period of 1500 or 2000 years and were greatly influenced by the then prevailing religious and social atmosphere, that many of their diota cannot be fully reconciled 80 as to form a consistent code of conduct, that they cannot be</p>

<p>It has further to be noted that the Mimāmsā rules were concerned only with the interpretation of the Vedic passages on sacrificial rites and matters relating thereto and had very little to do with the practices of people unconnected with sacrifices or religious rites, 2013 The Mimāmsāsūtra nowhere says that the same rules should be applied to the interpretation of smptis. On the contrary, the P. M. 8. is very critical about smṛtis and usages (vide P.M. 8. I. 3. 3-4 and 7). There are fundamental differences between the Veda and the smrtis. The.

<p>very large, they often differ so much from each other that even eminent authors and works like the Mitākṣarā had sometimes to give up in despair the idea of bringing order out of the welter of smrti pasaages and in their efforts at samanvaya had to say that certain smrtis refer to a former Kalpa or Yuga (i, e. to &amp; society of several thousands or millions of years ago ). One of the well-known maxims of the P. M. 8. is the one called &lsquo;Sarvaśa khāpratyayanyāya &lsquo;2074 or Sākhāntarādhikarananyaya&rsquo; (II. 4. 8-33). In the several recensions of the Veda and the Brāhma pas attached to the Vedic recensions the game rite is mentioned and is dilated upon with details some of which occur in one or more recensions but are absent from othera. Jaimini and Sabara establish that all the Sākhās of the Veda and the Brahma nas form one corpus, that such rites as Agnihotra and Jyotiṣ toma are one and the same in all recensions of the Veda. though the details may vary here and there, and this is the proper conclusion because the name (Jyotiṣtoma and the like) is the same in all recensions, the promised roward of the rite is the same, the materials of the sacrifice and the devatā are the same and the codanās (the exhortatory sentences) are the same. This very maxim was extended to smftis from very early times, Vigya rūpa, Medhātithi, the Mitakṣarā, 3075 Apararka and other commentators extend this to smrtis and provide that where smrtis are in conflict there is to be an option but that in other CABOS all the details are to be added up. But as an option was liable to eight faults the tendency developed that all smsti passages on a topic were to be so interpreted as to give no rise to conflict or to allow no option by means of various devices</p>

<p>such as. Visaya-vyavasthā&rsquo;, reference to another Kalpa or Yuga and so on. For example, even as regards the stock example of mkalpa (viz. taking or not taking the Sodasin cup in Attrātra) the Mit. says that it is proper to assume that it should be taken if it is possible to do so, or it may be assumed that by taking the Şodasin cup in Atirātra the attainment of scarga is hastened &amp;c. 2076 The result of regarding all smrtis as constituting one Śāstra was that many simple rites became in course of time Overloaded with details, complicated and taxing to the perfor. mer. But sometimes it is necessary to apply this doctrine. For example, Yāj. I. 135 requires the snūtaka not to look at the sun (nekṣetārkam ); this would mean that to look at the sun is prohibited at all times, but the dictum of Yāj. should be read along with Manu IV.37 which forbids a person to look at the rising or setting sun or at the sun when eclipsed or as reflected in water or when it is at the meridian. So the rule will be as stated by Manu.</p>
<p>While on this subject of the authoritativeness of Smrtis it would be useful to glance at what Jaimini and particularly Kumārila say about the Vedāngas. As regards Siksā (Phone tics ) Kumārila says that the account given in that work about the organs employed in pronunciation and the rules about Vedic accents have their use in the correct recitation of mantras. On the Kalpa-sūtras Jaimini 2077 has a separate adhikarang (I. 3. 11-14). Sabara mentions by name the Māsaka, Hastika and Kaundinyaka Kalpasūtras and the Tantravārtika draws &amp; distinction between kalpa (ritual of Srauta sacrifices ) and Kalpa. sūtras, and refers by name to eight.</p>
<p>These sūtras (PMS 1. 3. 11-14) have been interpreted by Kumārila in several different ways, firstly as referring to the authoritativeness of Kalpasūtras ( as done by Sabara ), Becondly</p>

The principal distinction is that Kalpas about each vedic sacrifice lay down simply the procedure that is ready made as handed down by oral tradition, while Kalpasūtras like those of Aivalāyana, Baljavāpi, Drāhyāyaṇa, Lāyāyana and Kātyāyana contain sanfras, B guns bhāsās, general rules, exceptions and definitions etc.</p>
<p>Buddhist works claimed to be smydis</p>
<p>1275</p>
<p>As referring to all the siz Vadangas and thirdly as referring to the 80-oalled smrtia of Buddha and others. That the Buddhist works claimed to be smrtis is clear from the Manusmrti 2078 the smrtis that are beyond the palo of the Veda and whatever other false systems may exist, they are all fruitless as to the (soul&rsquo;s ) Hereafter (destiny after bodily death), since they are all based on tamas (ignorance). Here some words will be said about the Vedāngas according to Kumārila. According to both Sabara and Kumārila, vyakarana is dealt with in Jaimini I. 3.24-29. In the Tantravārtika Kumārila launches an elaborate and telling (pūrvapakṣa) onslaught against Pāṇini himself, aganiet Kātyāyana (the author of the Vārtikas) and Patañjali (author of the Mahābhāṣya) in which some very interesting points are made but they have to be pagsed over for reasons of space. Kumārila says that the proper subject of grammar is to detera mine what words are correct or incorrect. It is intersting to note that in the prima facie attack against grammar two Pūrvamlmāṁsā sūtras are said to offend against grammar. 2079</p>
<p>The Nirukta of Yaska, which is one of the six angas of the Veda, is an extensive work and deals with the derivation of words, semantics, explanations of several hundred Vedic verses in whole or in part. Jaimini agrees with several conclusions of the Nirakta, which claims that without its help one cannot under stand the meaning of the Veda, that it has a purpose of its own and is a complement of grammar, and it controverts at great length the view of Kautsa 2010 that Vedic mantras have no meaning</p>

<p>tedāngas are comprehended under smrti 1217 Kumarile makes a general remark that all the six angas and the Dharmasastres are comprehended under Smrti, 2005</p>
<p>It appears that Jaimini did not attach much importance to Smśtis, since out of 915 (or 1000) Adhikarapas barely about a dozen are concerned in any way with smrtis alone, viz. I. 3, 1-2, I. 3,3-4, I. 3. 11-14, I. 3. 24-29, VI. 2. 21-22, VI. 2. 30, VI, 8. 23-24, VII, 1. 10, IX. %. 1-2, XII. 4. 43. Sabara, however, refers to emptis in many more places such as on VI. I. 5 and 13, IX, 1.6-9.</p>
<p>We are here concerned with the attitude of Jaimini and his early commentators like Sabara and Kumārila towards Smrtis. The established conclusion arrived at by Jaimini (in 1. 3.2) is that in case of conflict with the Veda Smrti is to be discarded, but if there be no confliot (of Smrti with Veda), it may be inferred (that Smrti is based on some Vedic text).</p>
<p>This amounts to saying that there is always &amp; presumption that smrtis are based on Veda, if their prescriptions are not directly in conflict with the Veda, Sportis proscribe the obser vance of Aṣtakā śrāddhas, the digging of tanke, following and obeying a teacher. These are authoritative because they do not conflict with any Vedic text of opposite import. The Smrtis do claim that they are based on the Veda. Gautama says so (in XI. 19 in note 2042) and Manu states (II. 7) whatever Dharma is proclaimed by Manu for anybody has all been ( already) declared in the Veda, since Veda possesses all knowledge&rsquo;.</p>
<p>In connection with smrtis and usages an important question ariges viz, if there is conflict between smrtis and usages of śiṣtas, which is to be regarded as more authoritative. Kumārila holds that if the practice of good men is not opposed to what is taught in the Veda and Smrti, such practices can be undorstood to be authoritative but if there is contradiction between what is taught by Veda and by Smrti and by usages, then their authori tativeness would be opposed (i. e. would be lost) and further that 1086 smrti is more authoritative because it is based directly</p>

<p>on the Veda, while in the case of usages, one has to infer that śiṣtas must have based their conduct on some smrti, whioh in its turn has to be deemed to be based on some Vedic text 1. e. usage is removed from the Veda by one step further than Smrtis and besides it is well-known that smstis are compositions by porsons who were deeply versed in the Veda, while the origins of usages are vague and unascertainable.</p>

<p>Though this is the theoretioal rule, supported by Dharma Śāstra works guch as Vas. I. 5, Mit. on Yāj. I. 7 and II. 117, Kullūka on Manu II. 10, one finds that usages opposed to smśtis have been in vogue from ancient times (such as the usage of marrying one&rsquo;s maternal uncle&rsquo;s daughter that is condemned by Manu and authoritative smrtis). The Vyavahāramayūkla (p. 98 of the text in B. G. S.) was constrained to observe that in the Purānas one often finds usages opposed to smṛtis. The courts have held that &lsquo;immemorial usage is transcendental law&rsquo; and that this is the translation by Sir William Jones of &lsquo;Scāraḥ paramo dharmaḥ&rsquo; in Madu I. 108. Vide H. of Dh. Vol. III. pp 874-876 for two interpretations of this verse of Manu I. 108 in modern times. Manu in (II. 10 ) asserts that Veda and smrti are in all matters not to be subjected to (hostile ) reaso ning, since Dharma shone forth from these two. Manu further provided that as rogards matters not specifically provided for, whatever brāhmaṇas that have studied the Veda together with the supporting lores (viz. the six aigas, mimārsā, Puriṇas &amp;c.) and that make others realize what Sruti gays are sistas and whatever they declare to be the Dharma in such unprovided cases is undoubtedly the Dharma.</p>
<p>It was declared by the Privy Council that under the Hindu system of law clear proof of usage will outweigh the written text of the law. 2087 From very ancient times customs and usages have been held to be authoritative. For examplo, Gautama XI. 20 says &lsquo;the usages of countries, castes and families are authoritative, provided they are not (directly ) opposed to Vedic texts.&rsquo; Manu I. 118 states that he has embodied in his Śāstra the long-standing customs and usages of coun tries, castos, families, heretical sects and guilds.

<p>Kumārila points out that even brāhmapa women of Ahi. cohatrā and Mathurā drank 2089 liquor in his day, that northern brābmaṇas engage in such transactions as the gift and sale of horses that have a mano, of mules, camels and animals that have two rows of teeth and eat from the same plate with their wives, children and friends, that brāhmaṇas of the South enter into matrimony with the maternal uncle&rsquo;s daughter and take their meals while seated on a couch of wiokorwork, that both (brāhmaṇas of the North and South ) take cooked food (kept in pots) that remains after their friends or relatives have partakon of it or that has been touched by them at the time of eating), that they chew tāmbula of botol leaves, betelnut, catechu and lime made into a roll that has been touched (in a botel-seller&rsquo;s shop) and do not sip water at the end of the chewing, wear clothes cleaned by washermen and brought on the back of asses, that they do not avoid the contact of persons guilty of grave sins except of the murder of a brāhmaṇa; there are also an infinite number of obvious violations of the subtle dictates of Dharma laid down for each man, caste or family, that these transgressions) are contrary to Sruti and Smrti and have a visible purpose and that it is not possible to regard such adulterated practices as Dharma inculcated by sadācāra.

<p>Even all actions done by great men cannot be called sadācūru, according to Kumārija, if they can be attributed to greed or some such base motive and should not be looked upon as Dharma. Gautama, 2090 Āp. Dh. S. and the Bhagavata-pura ṇa remark that even great men were guilty of violations of Dharma and defiant excesses, that those great men incurred no sin (got over the effects of such violations) on account of their being endowed with eminent tapas ( spiritual merit due to auster itios) but that others of later ages following their examples and treading the same path would sink (into hell). Kumarila cites twelve such instances of lapses, explains them away or says they were due to wrath of other passions and were not intended by the authors (of those acts) as dharma and are not looked upon as śiṣtācāra by modern men. The twelve instances are: Praja pati who became enamoured of his own daughter (Uṣas, explains Kumārila), Indra is described as the jāra (paramour) of Abalya (night, according to Kumārila&rsquo;s explanation); Vasiṣtha through grief for the slaughter of his hundred song by a demon contemp lated suicide ; Viśvāmitra who became officiating priest to Trisanku that had become a capdāla through a ourse; Nabusa who, when he occupied the position of Indra, made approaches to Saci, wife of Indra and was transformed into an ajagara (huge reptile); Purūravas, when separated from Urvasi, thought of dying (by hanging &amp;c.); Krṣpa-dvaipāyana who was naiṣthika (perpe tual) brahmacārin raised sons on the widows of his uterine brother, Vicitravlrya; Bhiṣma, though unmarried, performed Asyamedha sacrifices; Dhṛtarāṣtra, though congenitally blind, performed</p>

<p>sacrifices which blind men are not authorised to do (compare Jai. VI. I. 42); five Pāṇdavas marrying one Draupadi; Yudhi. ṣthira who prevaricated and thereby caused the death of Droṇa, his brāhmaṇa guru; Krona and Arjuna are described in the Mahābhārata as drunk with wine (&lsquo;ubhau madhyāsavakṣibau dṛstau me Keśayārjunau&rsquo; in Udyogaparva 59. 5) and married their maternal uncle&rsquo;s daughters; Rāma performed Asyamedha by associating a golden image of Bitā with him.</p>
<p>Kumārila displays great ingenuity in explaining away most of thege transgressions by plausible and specious argu ments, by relying on the great tapas in some cases (such as about Viṣvāmitra) and in some cases by downright denial (as in the case of Subhadrā being the sister of Krona ). 2091 Those interès ted may refer for all these instances and their explanations by Kumārila to H. of Dh. Vol. III, pp. 845-848.</p>
<p>One interesting adhikarana is the Holākādhikarana (Jai. I. 3. 15-23). It is said that Holākā should be observed by the easterners, Anninaibuka by Southernors, Udyrsabhayajña by northerners. The established conclusion is that such observancos are meant for all (and not merely for persons of the East or South &amp;c.), if they are fit to be done by 2092 easternors or souther ners (there is no reason why these should not be observances fit for all). The general rule about Vedic vidhis is that they are applicable to all Aryas; no cogent reason exists why a restrioted Vedic text should be inferred in the case of the above observa. ncas. Vide H. of Dh. VOL III. pp. 851-853 for detailed explana tion of this maxim and above pp. 237 ff. The Dāyabhāga ( II. 40 and VI, 22-23) refers to this maxim in connection with a double share to be allotted to the acquirer and with reference to a person acquiring property without detriment to the ancestral estate and explains the purpose of the Holākādhikaraṇa.</p>

There is a difference of opinion between medieval writers on Dharmaśāstra as to the exact import of this adhikarana. The Dayabhāga says 2093 that tho Sruti to be inferred from the practice of Holākā by easterners is simply the general one (sāmābya-śruti) that Holaka rites should be observed. On the other hand Govindananda in his Com. on the Prayascitta-viveks of Sūlapāṇi says that the Holakādhikarana leads to this only that the Sruti to be inferred from this practice is not in the form the easterners should por form Holāki&rsquo; but it is in a general form viz. &lsquo;the usage of a country should be observed by those in the country&rsquo;.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XXX On Mināmsā principles and rules of interpretation</p>
<p>in relation to Dharmasastra</p>
<p>The Pārvamimamas ayolyed a method of its own and a set of principles for the interpretation of Vedic texts. It is now time to get down and explain some of these principles and rulea and point out how they have been employed by Dharmasastra writers for solving their own difficulties.</p>
<p>The Mimārsā principles and rules of interpretation fall into several groups. There are rules that are concerned only with the details of Vedic saorifices and their inter-relations. The most important rule in this field is this that only Vidhis proper ly so called have absolute authority and binding force, while what are called arthavādas have authority in so far only as they form one syntactical whole with the vidhis and as they are meant to praise the vidhis. (P. M. 8. I. 2.7). Vidhis and Arthavādas are not discussed consecutively, but they are scattered over the several chapters of the P. M. S. For example, arthavādas are first dealt with in I. %. 1-18 (the arthavadādhi karaña), but in many other places there is a discussion about arthavādas as in III. 4. 1-9, II, 4, 10, III, 4. 11, IV. 3. 1-3, VI. 7. 26–30, X. 8. 5, X. 8. 7 and 8.</p>
<p>It should not be forgotten that the Mimarisi is not concer ned with legislation by the king or &amp; sovereign popular assembly. It promises to convey Correct knowledge of Dharma ( meaning religious rites and matters connected therewith) and the means of arriving at that knowldge is the Veda itself and the main purpose of the Mimāṁsa is to regulate the procedure (itikarta vyatā), the various auxiliary and principal matters in Vedic sacrifices. 2094</p>
<p>There is a great deal of difference between the interprota tion of statutes and the Mimāṁsā rules of interpretation. In the</p>

<p>first place, statutes are man-made, they express the will of the enaoting authority, have mostly secular purposes, may be amended or even repealed and have to be expounded according to the intent of those that made them. But the Mimamsa is Concerned with the Veda that is deemed eternal and self-eristent (and not man-made ), that deals with religious matters, cannot be amended or repealed and is to be expounded according to the intent of the Vedic words. Therefore, though some rules of the interpretation of Vedic texts evolved by the Pūrvamimāmsā are identical with or resemble the rules of the interpretation of statutes developed in such works as Maxwell&rsquo;s on interpretation of statutes&rsquo;, the author will not enter into any detailed treat ment showing the parallelisms betwood Mlmāngā rules and Maxwell&rsquo;s rules. This task was attempted over fifty years ago by Mr. Kishorilal Sarkar in his Tagore Law Lecturos published in 1909. It would appear ungracious on the part of the present author to offer criticisms against a predecessor in the same field who wrote more than half a century ago when Mimāmgā studies by modern educated Indians were in their infanoy. But the author cannot help stating that Mr. Sarkar was obsesed by the notion that he must show somehow or other that Jaimini&rsquo;s rules of interpretation were not inferior to those of Maxwell&rsquo;s and agreed closely with him. For this purpose he relies often on far-fetched analogies and employs obscure explanations. In several cases it appears that he had not been able to grasp correctly what Jaimini and Sabara meant. 2095</p>
<p>In this work the author is concerned only with the question of the influence on Dharmaśāstra of Pūrvamimāmsā dootrines and rules of interpretation. He has already shown how many of the dootrines and technical expressions of the Mimāṁsā have dominated Dharmagāstra. He would now turn to the rules of interpretation.</p>
<p>The first rule is that no part of the Veda ( not even a word) can be treated as anarthaka (meaningless or purposeless). It is therefore that a very large part of the Veda is treated 28 artha vadas intended to praise vidhis. This has been stated above (p. 1243). The result of the vital importance attached to vidhis</p>

<p>Result of regarding many Vedic texts as arthavadas</p>
<p>1285</p>
<p>in the PMS and of the assignment of a very subordinate role to arthavadas (as merely intended to praise) and to mantras ( as merely &lsquo;abhidhāyaka&rsquo;) has resulted in this that a small portion of the Brāhmaṇas has been held to be of supreme authority, while a large part of the Brāhmaṇas and of Sarhitās contain ing mantras has become of secondary importance or of little importance.</p>
<p>The Mimāmgā rules of interpretation fall into different classes from different standpoints. Some rules are general and some are special. Some rules have to do with the proper proce dure to be followed when several texts laying down matters relating to the same subject are in conflict by means of the application of the technical words sruti, linga, vākya, prakar ana, athāna and samākhyā (III, 3. 14) and there are rules about adhikara, atideśa, ūha, bādha, tantra and prasanga.</p>
<p>Some examples of general rules may first be cited. That vidhis alone have special obligatory authority and that artha vādas are authoritative only in so far as they form one syntactical whole with the vidhis is a general rule. The rules distinguishing between vidhis (properly so called), niyama vidhis and parisankhyā are general</p>
<p>The Mimāmgā rule is that where there is a 20% doubt about the exact meaning of a part of a passage, it may be determined by relying on the remaining parts of the pasbage. Vide above for the example &lsquo;he puts down anointed pebbles&rsquo; &amp;c. (p. 1240). The Mimāṁsā is very much against assuming conflict among Vedic texts and therefore allows an option only if there is no other way out. Vide remarks on vikalpa above (p. 1250). Another general rule is that the singular includes the plural. In the Mimāmgā it is called &ldquo;Grahaikatvanyāya (P. M. S. II. 1. 13-15). In the Jyotiṣtoma sacrifice a number of cups (grahas) filled with Soma are offered to deities and drunk at the three savanas (pressings of Soma) and Sruti states &lsquo;he wipes or cleanses the oup with the strainer made of white wool&rsquo; ( daśapavitrona graham sam-mārsti) and in the Dargapūrṇamāsa it is said &lsquo;he carries a firebrand round the purodāsa (cake).

</ol>
<p>whether a single oup (&lsquo;graham&rsquo; is the word used) is to be cleansed or a single purodāsa is to have a firebrand carried round it or whether all cups called grabas or purodagas are to be treated as stated. The established conclusion is that all grahas are to be cleansed and all purodāsas have the firebrand carried round them. The singular number is not intended to be insisted on. 2097 From this a further general rule is derived by Kumārila and others that an attribute of the subject (anuvādya or uddiśyamūna) 20% about which something is predicated (vidheya) is not intended and should not be insisted upon. This is fro quently relied on in Dharmaśāstra works. Yāj. II. 121 states that the father and son have equal ownership in land, &amp; corrody and wealth ( gold and silver &amp;c.) aoquired by the grand-father. Here the word pilāmaha is not to be insisted upon and the same rule applies to land or wealth acquired by a great-grand-father, as the V. M. says. 2099 Similarly, when Nāradasmrti says ( 16. 37)</p>
<p>of brothers being undivided religious worship (or rites) are one, but if there is a partition then they may have separate religious worship&rsquo;. Here the proper subject is the word &lsquo;undivided persons&rsquo;, and the word &lsquo;brothers&rsquo; is used only as an attribute, which is not intended to be insisted on and the same rule applies to undivided grand-father, father, sons, uncles and nepbows. Medhātithi on Manu II, 29 montions this maxim, The same rule is applied in some cases to gender also i. e. a word importing males includes females also. For example, Yaj. II. 182 and Nārada (8. 40 ff) lay down certain rules about a dāsa (male glave). The V. M. says that the masculine gender in those passages is not intended to be insisted upon, but the rules</p>

<p>apply even to female slaves. 100 There are exceptions to these rules. The rule about grahas does not apply to camasas (P.M. S. III, 1, 16–17). 2001 This rule that the qualification (viboṣana) of the subject in a vidhi is not meant to be taken literally and emphasized is applied in many other cases. Three verses from the Kālikāpurāpa are quoted by Kalpataru (on vyavahāra pp. 210-211) and V.M. (pp. 45-46) about the performance of an ordeal in certain grave charges and this maxim is applied by the V. M. there in the words &lsquo;paradārarūpam viśeṣanam-avivakṣitam abhisāpasyānuvādyatvāt&rsquo;; vide notes to V. M. pp. 83-84. But in &lsquo;paśum-ālabheta&rsquo;, where there is a vidhi about &lsquo;yāga it must be held that what is laid down is yāga as qualified by being made with a male animal and therefore only one paśu ( and that pasu a male ) is to be sacrificed.</p>
<p>Although the Veda employs the masculine gender (in gvargakāmo yajota, &lsquo;one desiring heaven should offer a sacrifice&rsquo;), yet Jaimini establishes (in VI. 1. 6-16 ) that even women are included and have a right to offer a yāga. 2102 Jaimini further provides that husband and wife should perform a religious right in co-operation (VI. 1. 17-21), but he provides that where the Sruti specifically provides for certain matters to be done by the yajamāna 2103 (the male performer ) it is the male alone who can</p>
<p>perform them as the wife is not equal to the husband in the knowledge of mantras and is ignorant and therefore she is restricted to the performance of those acts that are expressly enjoined for her such as looking at the clarified butter, observing brahmacarya and the like (VI. 1.24 &lsquo;tasyā yāvad-uktam-āsirbra hmacaryam-atulyatvāt&rsquo;.)

She has her waist girt up with &amp; yoktra (a triple cord of muftja grass) in Darsapūrṇamāsa and other sacrifices. She has also to look upon the clarified butter in the pot with a mantra (Tai 8.IL). 10.3.mahinām payosyoṣadhinām rasossi adabdhena tvā cakugas vek se suprajāstyāya&rsquo; (&lsquo;thou art the milk of cows, the fluid of borbs, with an invincible eye I look on thee for securing good progeny &lsquo;). The wife was to learn the mantras she had to repeat in sacrifices from her father or husband before the husband set up the sacred fires (vide H. of Dh. Vol. II. p. 1041 n). Gradua lly, the wife lost all importance in Vedic sacrifices and came to be a more silent spectator 7104 of all the weary details that had to be gone through by the sacrificer and the priest,</p>
<p>In spite of the above restrictions on the wife&rsquo;s powers about Vedic sacrifices many empti rules apply to women also, though the text employs the masculine gender. For example, Mapu XI. 93 provides that a brābmapa, ksatriya and vaisya should not drink surā. This prohibition applies to wives of the mombers of the three varṇas according to the Mit, on Yāj. II. 256.</p>
<p>The P.

<p>kapiñjala birds to be offered are only three (and not one nor two nor more than three ). Similarly, the gender in the passage &lsquo;he Bacrifices in the morning in spring an animal with dark coloured neck to Agni, in summer in the noon an animal of different colours, in the autumn in the afternood &amp; white animal to Bphaspati&rsquo;, it is a female animal that is offered because immedia tely thereafter the words they become pregnant&rsquo; occur. Dharma śāstra works often say that the masculine gender used in many texts excludes women. For example, the Agnipurāṇa 2105 (175. 59-61 ), when dealing with the rules to be observed in all vrataa in general, provides that the person undergoing prata should take a bath, should worship the golden images of the deities of the vratas, perform japa and homa and at the end of the vrata make gifts according to his ability and should feed 24, 12,5 or only three vipras. The N, S. quotes this from Pṛthylcandra and observes that as the masculine gender &lsquo;viprāḥ&rsquo; is employed only males of the brāhmaṇa class are to be fod and not women.</p>
<p>As against this, when Hemādri 2107 quoting Padma says &lsquo;If a woman is pregnant, freshly delivered, or is ill and becomes impure, she should get her vrata performed through another and when she becomes pure she may obseryo it personally,&rsquo; the N. 8. remarks that this applies to men also when they are impure, since the gender here is not intended to be emphasized.</p>
<p>There are Mimāmsā rules about the interpretation of words and also about sentences. First a few of the rules about words may be illustrated. (1) Sabara in the very first sentence of his bhāsya propounds the principle that as far as possible the words in the sūtras of Jaimini and in the Veda are to be understood in the sense in which they are understood in popular usage and not in a secondary or technical sense. The same rule is propounded by Jaimini in III. 2.1-2 in connection with the meaning of &lsquo;barhis&rsquo; in the mantra &lsquo;I cut the barhis as an abode for gods&rsquo;. Here the conclusion is that barhis is to be taken in the primary sense of &lsquo;handful of kusa grass&rsquo; and not in a secondary sense</p>

<p>such as kāśa or other kind of grass. Sabara windg up with the 3108 words between the primary and secondary senses of &amp; word it is proper to hold that the primary sense is to be taken for the business in hand&rsquo;. Again, on L 3. 30 Sabara says 2109 that the words are the same as in the Veda and popular use and the meanings are the same.</p>
<p>As regards the setting up of Vedic fires, the Tai. Br. I. 1.4 and Ap. Śr. V. 3. 18 prescribe different seasons for men of the three varnas and add that a &lsquo;rathakāra should set up Vedic firog in the rainy season. The question arises whether the word</p>
<p>rathakāra&rsquo; in these passages means a person of that casto ( i.e. whether it is to be taken in the popular sense ) or whether it refers to any one of any varna who manufactures chariots (i.e. the etymological sense). The established conclusion is that the popular sense is to be taken and not the etymological (P. M. 8. VI. 1. 44-50). In the case of the rathakāra the mantra for ādhāna (setting up of Vedic fires) is &lsquo;;bhūṇām tva&rsquo;(Tai. Br. I. 1. 4.8). Though not belonging to one of the three higher varpas, the ratbakāra could repeat that mantra because the Sruti ex prosaly authorized him to do so. but he was not entitled to upanayana. The P. M. S. (VI. 1. 50 ) held that the rathakāra (mentioned in the Tai. Br. and Āp. Śr.) was a caste called Saudhanvana which is neither gūdra nor one of the three higher varnas but is slightly inferior to them.

<p>widow to adopt is conceded, the more fact that she is not entitled to repeat Vedic mantras in general cannot deprive her of that right and that it is possible to hold, as in the case of the ratha. kara, that she can repeat the specifio mantra required in adop ting a boy. The Tai. 8. IV.5. 4. 2 separately mentions several craftamen such as takṣan, rathakāra, kulāla, karmāra &amp;o. From Atharvayeda III, 5. 6 and Vāj. S. 30. 6 (medhāyai rathakāram dhairyāya takṣāṇam) it appears that the rathakāra held a good position in the then society.</p>
<p>A word is to be understood in that shade of its meaning that is appropriate to the act in hand. For example, śruti says &lsquo;he cuts off with sruva, he cuts off with a knife, he cuts off with the hand&rsquo; (the same verb&rsquo;avadyati&rsquo; being used for all the acts ). The question is whether one is to cut all offerings, whether liquid or solid, whether of flesh or other substances, with sruva ladle or whether he is to employ the method or implement appropriate for each i. e. olarified butter should be taken from &amp; pot and offered by means of a sruya ladle, flesh should be out off with a knife and offered, and hard or thick things (like fuel sticks) should be offered with the hand. The conclusion is that one is to offer in the way most appropriate to each kind of offering. This is called &lsquo;samarthyādhikarana&rsquo;(PMS. 2111 I. 4. 25). The V. M. relies on this when dealing with the homa proscribed by Pitāmāba for all ordeals in the words &lsquo;homa should be offered in the four directions with clarified butter, boiled rice and fuel sticks &amp;o&rsquo; and deolares that the homa of clarified butter should be made with gruva ladle, of havis (i, e. &lsquo;boiled rios &amp;c&rsquo;) with Bruc and of fuel sticka with the (right) hand, on account of the fitness (samarthya) of these for the various offerings and sharply criticizes Raghunandana who in his Dāyatattva provided that the homa should be made of all three together (and not separate ly). A similar rule is applied to the ten sacrificial implements</p>

Here the Purvapaksa is that one may employ any one of these for any purposo required in the sacrifice ; the established conclusion (PMS III.1 11. and IV, 1.7-10) is that the enumeration of ten implements is a more anuvāda and is not to be understood as the pūrvapakṣa states, but each is to be employed for the purpose for which the Vedic texts prescribe it (such as one cooks the purodāśa on potsherds, pounds grains in mortar and pastle). Vide H. of Dh. vol. II, p. 985 n. 2233 for ton implements of sacrifice and others that are required and p. 1232 above for their disposal.</p>
<p>One and the same word must not be used in two songos in the same sentence, that is, in the primary sense and also in the figurative sense. 2112 This maxim is relied upon by the Day&amp;. bhāga. When brothers (sons of the same mother) come to &amp; partition, smrti texts (like Yaj. II. 123) proscribe that the mother takes &amp; share equal to that of a son. On this the Dāyabhaga remarks that the word &lsquo;mata&rsquo; (in Yaj. II. 123 and others ) pri. marily means a real mother (janani, that gives birth ) and this smrti rule has no application to the step-mother, since it is improper to hold that the same word once used in a sentence has a primary and a secondary sense at the same 2113 time. But It must be pointed out that all Dharmaśāstra works do not observe this rule. Aparārka ( p. 730) on Yaj. II. 123 (pitur-ārd hyam vibhajatām tātāpyamsam samam baret) includes the step mother under the word &lsquo;mātā&rsquo; following a text of Vyāsa) The Mitakṣarā interpreting Yāj. II. 135 about obstructible heritage stating the order of succession as wife, daughters, parents, brothers, their sons, provides that full brothers first succeed, in default of them half brothers, in default of the last, full brothers&rsquo;</p>

<p>BODA. The V. M. disagrees 2114 with this and says that the word * brother&rsquo; primarily means &lsquo;full brother&rsquo; and only secondarily &ldquo;half-brother', that, as it is not allowable to use a word like brother in two sonses in the same passage, in default of full brother his son succeeds (and not half-brother as the Mit. provides). The primary sense of a word is got by abhidhā', the secondary sonde by &lsquo;laksaṇā &lsquo;2115 and sometimes a third sense called suggested sense is said to be due to vyañjanā. These are the three výttis (functions) of a word.</p>
<p>One of the rules about the interpretations of words is con tained in P.M.S.I. 3. 8-9. Sabara cites three instances of words 7116 viz. caru made from yavas, sandals made of boar skin, a cane mat. The words yava, varāha and vetasa are respectively employed by some people in the sense of &lsquo;priyangu&rsquo; (long pepper), dark bird (crow) and jambu (black berry). The prima facie viow insists that one may use those words in any one of the two senses. The Siddhānta is that those words must be used in the songe in which the Veda (or śāstra) or sistas employ them i. e. the usage of learned Aryan people is to be followed where words</p>

<p>may have two or more sense8. As in several other cases Kumārila doos not like Sabara&rsquo;s explanation and proposes two other explanations, viz. one being that the sūtras relate to the word &lsquo;pllu&rsquo; used in the sense of a tree and mlecchas employ it in the sense of elephant. The meaning of the word in smstis is a tree and that should be followed. Here Śāstrasthāḥ&rsquo; means &lsquo;the sense given to the word in the Sāstra i.e. smsti&rsquo;. Another meaning he sees into those sutras is the comparative strength of smrti and acāra. This adhikarana is relied upon by Viśvarūpa on Yaj. (1 225) on the question of the primary meaning of the word Śrāddha which he states is &lsquo;pipdadana&rsquo; (offering balls of boiled rice to the manes) and pot feeding brāhmaṇas. The Parāśara-madhaviya refers to Parāśara-gmști (VI. 70-71) about the food cooked from rice in such quantities as measuring an ādhaka 3117 or drona and rendered unclean by being packed by crows or touched by dogs and smelt by 8880s and provides that the measuroa ādhaka and drona were to be taken as those known from sāstras and not those known among mlecchas,</p>
<p>Another rule (PMS I. 3.10 ) about words is that 2118 words, though of foreigd origin, that are in vogue in Sanskrit, are to be understood in the sonse which they have in the foreign language and one should not think of an attempt to derive them with the help of Nirukta and grammar. Sabara oites four such words viz. pika ( cuckoo), nema (half), tāmarasa (lotus), sata (circular wooden vessel).</p>
<p>Another rule about words is that where a single substance connected with several attributes is concerned in an action laid down for being carried out, all of these attributes should be taken to refer to the same one substance (PMS III. 1. 12). The Tai. 8. prescribes &lsquo;he purchases Souna with a heifer one year old and having brown eyes and reddish in colour&rsquo;. Here the two words &lsquo;piógākṣi&rsquo; and `ekahāyanl&rsquo; yield a good etymological meaning, are in the same case and so refer to the same substance</p>

<p>(helfer in this 2119 case). But the word arupaya' (of red colour) Causes a doubt viz. whether it should be separated from the other two words in the sentence and taken in the sense of any reddish substance such as a piece of cloth' or whether it should be connected with the verb (he purchases), should thus be subordinate to the purchase and should be taken as referring to the one year old heifer. This last is the established conclusion. How Soma is to be purchased does not follow from any other text. Therefore, in such a case several subsidiaries oan be laid down in one injunction. If &lsquo;arunaya&rsquo; be taken as referring to any red substance such as a piece of red cloth this one sentence would have to be divided into two vidhis &lsquo;be should purchase with a red piece of cloth&rsquo; and &lsquo;he should purchase with a brown eyed (heifer) one year old&rsquo;. This would be a fault oalled &lsquo;vākyabheda&rsquo;. This nyāya is explained by the Madanapārijata pp. 88-89 and Aparārka (p. 1030) makes use of 2130 it in explain ing the correct import of the words of the Br. Up. IV.4.21 &ldquo;tam etam vedānuvacanena brāhmaṇā vividiṣanti' by saying that when the higbest object in view is one but the subordinate elements are differont these latter are to be lumped together,</p>

<p>one that should be performed for niṣada-sthapati. A niṣada is a person born of a brāhmaṇa father and śūdra mother (vido Manu X. 8). He does not balong to one of the three higher Varnas. Sthapati means chief or leader'. The question whether the compound word means &lsquo;a niṣada who is a chief (that is a karmadhāraya compound) or whether it means the ruler of niṣadas&rsquo; who may not necessarily be a niṣāda himself but may be a ksatriya (i, e. whether one should take the word as ' ṣaṣthi tatpuruṣa' as &lsquo;niṣādānām sthapatiḥ&rsquo;). The conclusion is that a karmadharaya is more powerful than a tatpuruṣa, since in the former both the words may be directly connected with tho verb (nisādaścāsau sthapatiśoa, tam yājayet). The V. M. makes use of this maxim'. The Saunaka-smrti authorizes gūdras to adopt &amp; son, yet some writers like Rudradhara, author of Suddhiviveka, held that adoption required a homa with mantras and as a sūdra could not repeat vedic mantras he could not adopt. To this V. M. replies that his power to adopt a son being established by Saunaka&rsquo;s smrti all that is required is that he may get the homa performed through a brāhmaṇa. The Bhāmati on Saṅkarā&rsquo;s bhāsya or V, S.1. 3. 15, where the meaning of the word &lsquo;brahmaloka&rsquo; in Chandogya-Up. VIII.3.2 is in question, says that the nisādasthapatinyaya applies and so &lsquo;brahmaloka&rsquo; means &lsquo;brahma as the goal&rsquo; and not the world of brahma. Manu XI. 54 enumerates five Mahāpātakas (deadly sins), ona of which is &lsquo;guryanganāgama&rsquo; (sexual intercourse with gurtanganā). Commentators have differed about the meaning of this word, some like Bhavadeva in Prayasoittaprakarana stating that, following niṣādasthapatinyāya, the word must be dissolved as a Karmadharaya compound (guruh or gurvi odgau anganā ca), the meaning being one&rsquo;s own mother, while many others dissolve it as a tatpuruṣa compound meaning &lsquo;guror or gurūpām anganā&rsquo; (which would then include a step-mother, an elder brother&rsquo;s wife and teacher&rsquo;s wife &amp;c.).

<p>sentence. Therefore, he and his followers were called &lsquo;anvita bhidhānayādinah&rsquo; as opposed to Kumārila and his followers who beld that words have different SODSON of their own and then they combine in a sentence and yield a further sense of the sentence. These latter were called &lsquo;abhihitanvayavadinah:: Vide notes to Sābityadarpaṇa (I., II., X) pp. 86–88 for explana tions of these two terms by the present writer ( ed. of 1956 ).</p>
<p>Let us now turn to the interpretation of vākya ( sentence). The Rgveda and the Sāmaveda are metrical and therefore there is generally no difficulty in arriving at what constitutes in them one syntactical unit (vakya). But much of the Krsna Yajurveda is in prose. Therefore, PMS (II. 1. 46 ) defines 2133 what makes one vākya by stating that when a number of words serve a single purpose, but if one or a few of those words are separated from the rest, the latter words are incomplete in effecting a purpose and stand in need of the words separated, then all these words make one vākya. An example is the mantra &lsquo;I offer thee, that art dear to Agni, at the command of God Savitr with the arms of Asvins, with the hands of Pūṣan&rsquo;. This is one sentence, the purpose of which is nirvāpa ( offering ). For other definitions of vakya, vide the author&rsquo;s notes on Sahityadarpana (II. 1) p. 34. For constituting words into a sentence with an understandable meaning expectancy 3123 (akanksa), compatibility (yogyata) and proximity (sannidhi) are required, particularly the first. For example, Saṅkarācārya on V, S. I. 4. 3 says that without ākāākṣā there is no cognition</p>

<p>that the words form a vākya. The word ekavakyatā occurs in V.S. III.4.24 and conveys that there is a twofold akankss vir grammatical as well as psychological. It is the listener or roader who has, on hearing or reading a word, a desire to know another idea or word to get a complete senge. When soveral sentences, each conveying its own sense as far as it goes, are brought together having regard to the fact that one of them may be principal and the others auxiliary, they form one syntactioal whole. This shows that sentences are of two kinds, vākyas and mahāvākyas, as the Sabityadarpaṇa puts it.</p>
<p>It follows from the definition and the bhāsya thereon that, in order to constitute a vākya, three conditions are nocessary viz. (1) there must be a number of words uttered or put down together (padasamuha), (2) the words must have an expect ancy for each other (i.o. if a word in the collection is dropped no complete sense can be had), (3) all the words must sorve one purpose or convey together one meaning (arthaikatva, 800, to another view). It is not absolutely necessary that the words in order to form a vākya must be in close proximity. Even if some words intervene there may be a sentenco, provided there isaksiksa between the words. Sabara on PMS IV. 3.11 illus trates this well as stated in the note. 3124 In the verso quoted</p>
<p>paśyasi&rsquo; is to be connected with jaradgavam&rsquo;, though several other words intervene. Though there is proximity (sannidhi) between &lsquo;pinaksi&rsquo; and &lsquo;jaradgavam&rsquo; they do not form a sentence as there is no capacity as also akānkṣā between tbe two. The upshot is that sannidhi (proximity) of words is generally required to form a sentence, though not necessarily required in every case.</p>
<p>The different parts of a mantra text, meant to serve different purposes, may be regarded as distinct sentences. For example, the mantra in Tai. Br.2125 (III. 7.5) &lsquo;I make an agreeable</p>

<p>Thego are two sentences, the first part being concerned with making a seat, the latter part being concerned with depositing the purodāśa on the seat. Similarly, in the passage &lsquo;I (out) thee (O palāsa branch ) for food, I (wash or rub) thee for vigour&rsquo; there are two different sentences, that are independent of each other, as the Sat. Br. employs those with the words &ldquo;he cuts the palaba 3126 branch with the words for food (I out) thee', he washes it with the words &lsquo;for vigour thee&rsquo;. The same rule applies to the ten different clauses ayuryajiona kalpatām, prāṇo yajñena kalpatām' in Tai, S. I. 7. 9.%. They are all different sentonces, 2127</p>
<p>The doctrine of Vākyabheda plays a very important part in Mimārsā as well as in Dharmaśāstra. Vākyabheda literally means &lsquo;split of sentences&rsquo;. When the sentences are equally independent and one sentence does not require or expect words from the other sentence to complete it, they should be treated as separate sentences. This is one sense of Vākyabheda.' Another and more frequent sense of Vākyabheda is as follows: The under lying principle of vākyabheda is that one and the same text cannot be construed as laying down two separate vidhis (pres criptions) or that when a certain matter has already been prescribed and then several auxiliary matters are to be prescri bed, prescribing 2128 all the auxiliaries in one sentence would</p>

<p>give rise to the fault of vākyabheda (syntactical split of sentence). In Tai, S. there is the following passage the sacri ficial post is to be of udumbara tree, the udumbara (tree) is vigour, cattle is vigour; he obtains for him ( the sacrificer) by means of vigour urj ( i. e, by udumbara post) vigour (i. o. cattle) for the attainment of vigour&rsquo;. This is one syntactical whole ( vākya). If it be said that there is a vidbi prescribing the use of udumbara post in a sacrifice and that there is also another vidhi about the fruit viz. securing vigour (i. e, cattle); this would give rise to vākyabheda. Therefore there are no two vidhis in the sontence but only a vidhi and an arthavada (praise ). 2129 Saṅkarācārya on V. S. III. 3. 57 remarks &lsquo;ekam hidam vākyam Vaiśvānaravidyaviṣayam paurvāparyālocanāt pratigate &hellip; eka vākyatāvagatau satyam vakyabheda-kalpanasyānyāyyatvāt.&rsquo; This is said with reference to the first aspect of the idea of Vākyabheda.</p>
<p>The basic idea underlying the latter sense of vākyabheda is this. If an act or a substance or a secondary matter has already been the subject of a vidhi and if concerning the act (or substances &amp;c.) a number of other matters (aotions, subs tances &amp;c.) are enjoined in one sentence, there would be vākyabheda (i. e. there would have to be a separate vidhi for each of the other matters relating to what has already been the subject of a vidhi). On the other hand, if an action, substance or a guna is enjoined for the first time along with several secondary matters in one sentence, there would be no fault of vākyabheda i, e, in a single vākya however long or containing many matters, if there is a single vidhi there is no fault. If, in the passage quoted on p. 1258 above 3130 &lsquo;one desir ing prosperity should offer in sacrifice a white animal to Vāyu&rsquo;, one were to hold that first there is to be a vidhi about prosperity as the fruit or reward, there would be two vidhis and so the fault of vākyabheda, but if one holds that the vidhi is only concerned with offering a white animal and what follows &lsquo;vayurvai kṣepiṣ. tha&hellip;&hellip; bhūtim gamayati&rsquo; is merely an arthavāda ( praise of the preceding vidhi), there is no vākyabheda.

<p>Diramples of vākyabheda</p>
<p>1301</p>
<p>bheda arises when more vidhis than one are held to occur in the same vākya. 2131</p>
<p>A few examples must be cited to illustrate the principle of vālyabheda. A sinple example is &lsquo;graham sammārṣti&rsquo;. If one were to interpret this as meaning &lsquo;ho is to clean the cup&rsquo; and also as meaning that only a single cup is to be cleaned there would be vākyabheda. Therefore, it was decided that the singular number in &lsquo;graham&rsquo; is not to be insisted upon and cleaning of all cups was to be resorted to; otherwise there would be two vidhis viz. &lsquo;graham sammrjyāt&rsquo; and &lsquo;okam-eva sammṭiyāt&rsquo;. Sabara quotes (on PMS I.3.3) a śruti &lsquo;one who has a son and whose hair is dark should consecrate the vedic fires&rsquo;. Agnyādhāna is laid down by sruti texts such as Tai. Br. I. 1. 2.6, Sat. II. 1. %. Therefore, the above text only lays down certain subsidiary matters about it. A man may have dark hair but no son or he may have a son when his hair is turning grey. Therefore, if that sentence is meant to prescribe both attributes (having a son and also having dark hair), there would be two distinct vidhis in the same vākya, that is, there would be the fault of vāky&amp; bneda, which has to be avoided. Therefore, that sentence must be understood as indicating a certain age viz. he must not be &amp; mere boy (at the time of agnyādhāna) but of an age to bear &amp; son, nor very old (when hair turns groy ). i. e, he must be neither too young nor too old at the time of agayādbāna. A lakṣaṇā as regards the words &lsquo;jātaputrah&rsquo; and &lsquo;kṣṣpakeśaḥ&rsquo; is resorted to and lakṣaṇā is only a fault as to a word, while vākyabbeda is a fault of a sentence and therefore laksanā should be preferred to vākyabheda. The V. M. quotes (p. 115) the verge of Manu 2132</p>

<li>This text of Manu has been a subject of several conflicting judicial decisions, which are now of no use since there is now a law governing Hindu Adoptions viz. the Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act 78 of 1956, by section 12 proviso b of which the decisions in 40 Bom. 429 and in some later cases have been set aside. Those interested may read the present author&rsquo;s notes in his translation of the V.M, pp. 121-123 and the footnotes and his paper (Brief sketch of the Purvabimansa system pp. 37-38 (ABORI, vol.

<p>IX. 142 &lsquo;the son given shall not have (share) the family name (gotra) and the wealth (riktha) of his natural father; the pinda (cake offered to deceased ancestors) follows the family name and the wealth; of him who gives (his son in adoption) the svadha (obsequies) cease (so far as that son is concerned). After citing the above smrti passage &lsquo;one having a gon&rsquo; and another text&rsquo; for the position of the sacrificial post (vide PMS III. 7. 13-14) with reference to the altar, the V. M. holds that one should not merely emphasize the words gotra, riktha, pinda and svadha used by Manu and take them literally but should hold that the verge contains a lakṣaṇā (indicated meaning ); it indicates the cessation of all those consequences that are due to connection with tbe piṇda in the case of the natural father and Manu says nothing about the property taken by a son before he is given in adoption into another family.</p>
<p>Another illustration of vākyabheda can be cited from the law of re-union. The Mit., Dayabhāga and Sm. O. (on Vyavahtra p. 302 ) quote &amp; text 2133 of Bṛhaspati that man who being once separated from his father, brother, or paternal uncle again dwells</p>
<p>(Continued from last page) gatural family that had become vested in bin before adoption. That decision holds that Manu laid down two propositions, viz. (1) a man forfeits by adoption into another family the property that once belonged to the family and that became vested in him before adoption, (2) A person given in adoption into another family does not, after the adoption, take any property of the family to which he belonged bat whose connection with the family ceased after adoption. These are two distinct propositions and to hold that Mano&rsquo;s text is capable of these two propositions is liable to the fault of Vākyabheda. The V. M. (p. 115 ) further relies on the construction of another vedic text &lsquo;He fixes half of the yūpa inside the vedi and half outside it.&rsquo; This is interpreted by PMS III. 7. 13-14, Sabara and the Tantravārtika as merely indicating a certain region for the fixing of the yāpa and that the words are not to be taken literally, because in that case there would be Vākyabbeda. The guyer briags out the meaning clearly. &lsquo;समस्तस्य यूपस्थान्तर्बहिर्वा माने माने अर्थमन्तदि-इति नियम्पते। द्वितीयस्थार्थस्य पुनरप्पा नियमप्रसको-अर्धे पहिदि-इत्यपि विधातव्यम् । ततश्चानेकार्थवादास्यभेदो मिनोस्यालया तानुषङ्गलेशव प्रसज्यते । अतश्चेशमबधारणमर्धमन्तरवेयेव न स्वर्धमेवान्तदीति । वथा सति चार्धान्तरमनियतत्वात् कदाचिदन्तरपि प्रामोतीति न पहिवः सिद्धचतीति। &hellip; तस्मादमाम्या विशिष्ट एको देशोऽभिधीयत इत्येवमवाक्यमेवः।</p>

<p>Examples of vākyabheda</p>
<p>1303</p>
<p>through affection with them (or any of them) is said to be re-united with them (or him. According to the Mit., &amp; reunion is possible only with father, brother and paternal uncle and with no one else, since no one else is mentioned in the text of Bphaspati. The V. M. does not approve of this limitation and says that a re-union is possible with all or any of those that participated in the partition and that the three persons, father, brother and uncle are mentioned only by way of illustration (i. e. there is lalṣanā). A man may separate not only from the three named persons but also from his paternal grand-father, the grandson of his brother and the son of his paternal uncle and Boveral other persons and therefore the construction of the text of Bphaspati by the Mit, is liable to the fault of vākyabheda, since on that interpretation there would be two separate proposi tions viz. (1) that man is to be called ro-united who having become separate again stays together with the one from whom he separated, (2) one can re-unite only with the father, brother, or paternal uncle. Thus there would be two distinct prescriptions in one sentence. Therefore, one should have recourge to laksanā viz. that the three named porsons indicate a class of persons from whom one may have soparated but with whom he then stayed together. The Viramitrodaya (on Vyavahāra), V. R. (pp. 605-67), V. C. p. 533 hold the same view as that of the V. M. 2134</p>
<p>The Smrtioan drikā provides that after the death of a man when the sons divide, the mother is entitled to a share equal to that of each son if the estate to be divided is not very large, but if the estate be very large she is to get as much only as would be necessary for her maintenance (although Yāj. II. 123 and others employ the words &lsquo;samam ansam&rsquo;). The Madanaratna on Vyavahāra criticizes this as a bad provision on the ground that it is vitiated by Vakyabheda, since there would be two different propositions (vidhis) about the meaning to be attached to the</p>

<p>words &lsquo;samam amsam&rsquo; (equal share) according as the estate to be divided is large or small. 135</p>
<p>There is another principle about sentences called &lsquo;anuṣanga&rsquo; (elliptical extension) or the extension of a word, phrase or clause from a sentence to another or other sentences, provided all those sentences are of the same type or form. This is one type of anuṣanga. Another type is where each of two or more sentences appears to be complete by itself, but there are certain words of a subordinate character in the last sentence of a passage which have to be taken up or understood in the preceding sontences. This latter is also called anukar sa. In the three upasads of Jyotistoma, the first 2136 is in honour of Agni in which the mantra is &lsquo;yā to Agne ayāśayā tanūr-varṣiṣthā gavharesthogram yaco apāvadhim tvegam vaco apāvadhim svāhā&rsquo;; the other two Upasads have the two mantras &lsquo;yā te Agne rajasaya&rsquo; and &lsquo;ya te Agne harasaya&rsquo; which are incomplete and in need of complementary words to complete the sentences. The conclusion is that the words &lsquo;Varsistha &hellip; SVaha&rsquo; are to be sup. plied from the first sentence apd not other words from the popular language that one may choose. Another passage of the Tai, 2137 8. is &lsquo;cit-patistva punatu, vakpatis-tvā punatu, devas-tva savita punatvacchidrena pavitrena vasoh sāryasya rasmibhih&rsquo;. Here the first two clauses appear to be prima facie complete, but when we look to the last clause where the word &lsquo;punātu&rsquo; is parti cularised by certain other words, we at once feel that the first two clauses also should be connected with the words &lsquo;acchidroṇa&hellip; raśmjbhiḥ&rsquo; and that then they would be quite complete</p>

<p>Principle of anu sanga illustrated</p>
<p>1305</p>
<p>The V. M. has a long disquisition on the principle of anuṣanga applied by the Mit. and Madanaratna to the succes. sion to the wealth of one who died re-united. Yaj. II. 135-136 lay down the order of succession to the wealth of a person dying sonless. Yaj, II. 137 deals with succession to the property of a forest hermit, an ascetic or a perpetual Vedic student. The Mit. then holds that Yāj. II. 138 samspstinastu samsrsti&rsquo; is to be construed as an exception to Yaj.II. 135-136 and understands that the words of one dying without having a son&rsquo; (grandson or great-grandson) are to be supplied before Yāj. II. 138 from II. 136 (i. e. there is to be anuṣanga of the words &lsquo;syaryātasyāputrasya&rsquo;. The V. M. does not approve of this and states that there is no rational ground for applying the principle of anuṣanga and therefore the order of succession to the property left by one re-united propounded by V.M. becomes different from that of the Mit. The whole discussion is rather abstruse and lengthy and the present writer feels that the space required for exposition should be saved. Those interested may consult the exhaustive notes (pp. 265-275) in the edition of the Vyavahāramayūkha (Poona, 1926) on the passages of the v. M. beginning with the one in the note below. 138</p>
<p>This principle of apuṣanga capnot apply where words of a different type intervene between the several sentences. For example, when the animal to be offered is killed a long passage occurs which contains the 2139 words &lsquo;sam to prāpo vāyunā gaochatām, sam yajatrair-angāni, sam yajñapatir-āśiṣā&rsquo; &amp;c.

<p>Veda enjoins many acts such as performing a yāga, casting an oblation into fire, making a gift, milking a cow, melting clarified butter &amp;c, but all are not on the same level. Some aro pradhāna (primary 2140 or principal), while others are guṇa bbūta (subsidiary). The acts denoted by words such as Prayājas by which some substance is not embellished or not made fit or is not produced are primary, while those which produce a substance or make it fit (such as pounding in the case of grains of paddy) are subsidiary. Acts are further classified into Various groups such as nitya, naimiltıka or kūmya or as kratyartha and puruṣartha. These have already been explained. There are six means 2141 by which is ascertained the difference or non difference among acts viz. (1) sabdāntara (different words, such as yajati, juhoti, dadāti, i. o. yāga, homa, dāna are different acts); abhyāsa 2113 (repetition) as in samidho yajati, tanūna. pātam yajati&rsquo; &amp;o. (Tai. 8. II. 6. 1. 1-%), where the word yajati is repeated five times and therefore there are five different acts prescribed; (3) sankhyā (number ) as in &lsquo;he sacrifices seventeen animals to Prajāpati&rsquo; (Tai. Br, I. 3. 4. 3), which are seventeen distinct acts; (4) guna (an accessory detail suoh as the deity</p>

<p>Means of ascertaining karmabheda illustrated 130% or substance in such a passage as when curda 2143 are put into heated milk it turns into curdlad solid mass āmikṣā which is offered to Visvedevas and the liquid called vājina is to be offered to Vajins, these two being two distinct offerings); (5) prakarana, (context). In the sentence &lsquo;one should offer agnihotra&rsquo; (Tai. S. I. 5. 9.1) there is a vidhi of the daily performance of Agnihotra In the Kundapāyinām-ayana 2144 it is said &lsquo;he offers agnihotra for a month&rsquo;. Since this last oocurs in a different context altogether (while the former occurs in the context of Darsa pūrṇamāsa), this sentence (from Kuṇdapāyinām-ayana) deals with a different act from that of the daily Agnihotra. (6) The name (Sanjñā) also differentiates acts, since they ocour in utpattivākya (originative injunction ) as in the passage quoted jn the note below. 2145 This technique about determining what actions are different on account of the several grounds noted above, was employed by Hemadri, the Kalanirnaya and the Nirnayasindhu in deciding whether Janmāṣtamīvrata and Jayantivrata are really one vrata or separate vratas. Vide pp. 132–133 above.</p>
<p>It has already been stated above (p. 1228) that there are four kinds of vidhis of which viniyogavidhi is one. This last conveys the relation between a religious act as principal (seṣin or angin) and 2146 its auxiliaries (angas). This is the concern of the third chapter of the P. M. S., which first defines &lsquo;$eṣa&rsquo;, states why it is called &lsquo;besa&rsquo;, how it is employed in religious acts, what are the means of determining the relation of sega to seṣin and the comparative strength of each of the means.</p>

<p>Some examples of anga and angin may have to be given here. In vribin prokṣati&rsquo; (he sprinkles rice grains with water) the sprinkling (prokṣaṇa) is an anga (stands in &amp; subsidiary relation to) of rice grains as directly shown by the objective case ( vrihin). The prokṣapa (is motivated by) has the purpose of contributing to the transcendental result (the apūrva), since what is meant is that if, without the sprinkling of water on the rice grains, a sacrifice (yāga ) were performed, apūrva would not be brought about. To take another example, 2147 &lsquo;he takes hold of the bridle of the horse with (the mantra beginning with ) &lsquo;they took hold of the bridle of pta (cosmic order). Here the direct assertion (śruti) shown by the objective case in &lsquo;raśanām. shows that that mantra stands in a subordinate relation to (is an abga of) the bridle of the horse, since the utterance of it when taking hold of the bridle of the horse effects a samskāra in the bridle and taking hold is also an anga of the horse bridle (which is in the objective case ), just as prokṣaṇa is an anga of rica grains.</p>
<p>It has already been stated that sasa&rsquo; means what subserves the purpose of another&rsquo; and it is seṣa of that other (P. M. S. III. 1.2. Segah pararthatvāt&rsquo;) and that, according to Badari (III, 1. 3) &lsquo;to substances, properties (like reddish colour of a cow). samskaras 2118 ( what makes a person or thing fit for being employed in a yāga or for any other purpose) the word soṣa is always applied, while, acc. to Jaimini (III. 1. 4-6) religious rites are sosa to the result or fruit (expressed or implied), the fruit is sesa to the agent of religious acts and an agent is sega to certain acts. The word “sosa&rsquo; is often employed by Dharm aśāstra worke. For example, the Mit. while commenting on Yaj. II. 118-119 states that the first half of verse 118 is seṣa to all the rest 2119 ( i. . serves the purpose of the remaining verse and &amp; half).

This view of the Mit. was not shared by several other writers and works such as the Dāyabhāga (VI. 1.8), and Viśvarūpa. Vide H. of Dh. vol. III. pp. 579-580 for further remarks.</p>
<p>The P. M. S speaks of six means that are helpful in deter minig, as regards viniyoga-vidhis, what are principal and what are auxiliary when there is a doubt or when there is a conflict, They are śruti (direct vedic statement or assertion), linga (indirect indication), vākya (syntactical connection or relation), prakarana (context), sthāna (place or sequence), samākhyā (sañjñā, name). When several of these come together and refer to the same subject each succeeding one is weaker than each preceding one, since each succeeding one is more remote than sach preceding one from the objective (viz. the viniyoga). P. M. S. III. 3. 14 is called &ldquo;balabalādhikaraña&rsquo;, 2150</p>
<p>An example where both śruti and liiga come in conflict is with the Aindri verse (verge addressed to Indra) he should worship the Gārbapatya fire'. The verse addressed to Indra 2151</p>

But here fat and mean respectively forcuat tai midi, MOGATACH Pop i.e. a vedic word or a passage that is independent (1.e. does not require any intermediate step to be takon) and linga means the sugges tive power of words.

<p>is &lsquo;nivesanaḥ sangamano vagūbām&hellip;Indro na tasthau samare pathinām&rsquo;(Tai. S. IV. 2. 5. 4). Here the doubt arises whether one should worship Indra as the word &lsquo;Aindrya&rsquo; indicates or whether one should worship Gārbapatya (as the passage directly asserts) with a verse addressed to Indra, or whether one should worship both or whether one should worship either Indra or Gārhapatya as one likes. The conclusion is that sruti (direct Vedic assertion) is more powerful than linga. On hearing the words. Garhapatyam upatiṣthate' we are directly told by the Veda about the worship of Garhapatya. The word &lsquo;Aindrya&rsquo; being in the instrumental (as in &lsquo;dadhna juhoti&rsquo;-he performs homa with curds) merely supplies a detail (guna) vix, that the mantra to be repeated is one addressed to Indra and there is no word that directly asserts that Indra is to be worshipped, 2152 Sabara on PMS JIL 2. 4 explains that even Gārbapatya has some of the qualities of Indra and so metaphorically he may be called Indra ( as a brave man is called a lion), since Gārhapatya is &amp; means of accomplisbing yajña like Indra or Gārbapatya may be called Indra from the root &lsquo;ind&rsquo;, and may be taken to mean&rsquo;s master or lord'.</p>
<p>The six means may each come in conflict with all the means that follow each of them. Therefore, there will be five cases of conflict of śruti with linga (which has already been desoribed ) or with vākya, or prakarapa or sthāna or samākhyā; there will be four cases of conflict between lióga and vākys or each of the three ones ( of the means) that follow vakya in the sūtra, ia the same way vākya may be in conflict with prakarapa and the other two (in all three cases), prakarapa may be in conflict with sthāna or samākhyā (i. e. two cases) and sthāna may be in conflict with samākhyā. So that there are in all fifteen cases of conflict of the six means among themselves. We need act</p>

<p>take into account the conflict of one of the six means with its predecessors, since to say that linga may be in conflict with bruti is the same thing as saying that śruti may be in conflict with linga. Very large space would have to be devoted if all these fifteen possible conflicts are to be exemplified from Vedic and Dharmaśāstra texts. Therefore, the author does not essay that task.</p>
<p>Dharmaśāstra works often utilize this adhikarana called balabala (PMS III. 3. 14). For example, the Par. M. quotes 2153 &amp; śruti passage that one should perform the daily evening sandhyā adoration of Aditya (the sun) with mantras addressed to Varupa and remarks that “ Vārupibhiḥ&rdquo; (like Aindryā) is only linga while, Adityam-upsthāya&rsquo; is sruti ( direct assertion) and therefore the sun is to be worshipped in the evening with mantras addressed to Varuna and refers to the example &lsquo;aindrya gārhapatyam upatiṣthate&rsquo; for support.</p>
<p>The fourth adhyāya of the PMS deals mainly with the subo ject of prayojya and prayojaka and kratvartha and puruṣārtha. The latter two have been explained and illustrated above (pp. 1232-1235). A few illustrations of the first two may be given. The Prayājas have been declared above to be keratvartha (p. 1233 ). Therefore, kratu ( sacrifice) is the prayojaka ( motivating force ) of Prayājas. The reward (phala, Svarga or the like) is the prayojaka of yāga or &amp; puruṣārtha rite. That is a prayojaka for the sake of which &amp; man is led to perform something by a Vedic exhortatory passage. The sentence is one should offer the Darsapūrṇamāsa saori fice for securing svarga'; therefore the toward ( svarga and the like ) is the prayojaka of Darśapūrṇamāsa-yāga. 2154 The injunction to mix ourde with milk makes a person do so for producing Imikṣā and not vājina, since this latter arises of it</p>

<p>self in preparing amikṣi. Therefore, it is amiksa, being the havis in the Vaiśvadovayāga that is the prayojaka of the Vaiśvadovayāga and vājina-yāga is not the prayojaka of putting curds into milk 1155 (P. M. S. IV.1 22-24). The result is that, if by accident āmikṣā is destroyed, in order to secure the havis (āmiksā ) curds will have again to be put in boiled milk, but if zājin, not being prayojaka, is destroyed, ourds need not be put into boiled milk again,</p>
<p>Examples of puruṣārtha acts have been given above !p. 1234) such as the Prājāpativrata. This chapter (in 2nd pāda) deals with several cases of pratipattikarma and arthakarma already explained abɔve (pp. 1231-3?). There are certain substanov8, certain embellishments and subsidiary actions with which some phala is associated. For example, it is said (in Tai. 8. III. 7.5.2)&lsquo;he who has juhū ladle made of parṇa ( palāśa ) wood nover bears an evil word about himself&rsquo;; &lsquo;that he applies collyrium (to his eyes), he injures the eye of his enemy&rsquo; (Tai, S. VI. I. 1.5); &ldquo;That he performs the Prayājas and Anuyājas, that is indeed the armour of the sacrifice: PMS declares that these texts about rewards associated with substances, embellishments and sube sidiary acts are really not ridhis about rewards but are more arthavadas, because all these serve the purpose of the principal kratu. 2356</p>
<p>This fourth chapter (in 3rd pāda) also decides that, al though no reward is expressly declared by Śruti (the Veda) for the performance of the Viśvajit sacrifice, still in the Viśvajit sacrifice ( and in other sacrifices where no reward is expressly mentioned ) syarga is the reward. 2157</p>
<p>The Viśvajit is a striking sacrifice in which the performer donates all belongings of which he is the owner (&ldquo;Viśvajiti Barva</p>

Some of the interesting propositions are : the performer cannot donate his own relatives (such as father or mother) but can denote that of which he is real owner or master; that even the emperor cannot make a gift of the whole kingdom, as other people have rights over land and the king protects the people and has only the right to a certain share in the produce of the land; that the performer cannot donate borge8 as gruti expressly forbids the gift of horses in Viśvajit; that the performer can donate only that which exists as his property at the time of giving dakśiṇā in the sacrifice and not that which may become his at a future date; that a sūdra 2159 who waits upon the performer because it is his duty to serve (acc. to Manu) cannot be donated; a person of a higher varna cannot be donated; only he who has 112 cows or more wealth is entitled to perform Viśvajit.</p>
<p>___The 5th adhyaya of P.M.S.deals with krama (the order in which the several component parts or acts that go to make up a sacrifice are to come one after another).

<p>In the Vedic passage about the dikṣā in &amp; saftra, the adbparya, after performing the diksa (initiation rite) on the shapati (the yajamāna, the performer of the sacrifice) performs dikṣā on the brahmā priest, then on udgāt? etc. the Vedic text directly lays down the sequence (by means of the tormination &ldquo;ty!) that the diksā of brahmā priest cones after the diksā af the yajamāna. In the passage &lsquo;samidho yajati tanūnapatam yajati &amp;c. the very order in which the sentences occur in the text (i. e. patha) determines the order of the performance of the Beveral yāgas (PMS V.1.4). The Voda first speaks of the offar ing of Agnihotra and then of the cooking of gruel Here the offering of Agnihotra comes first and preparation of gruel comas after that. But, unless the material to be offered is ready, no Agnihotra offering can be made. Therefore, here the pathae krama has to be given up and arthakrana (order as diotated by the purpose and guitability ) has to be followed i.e. first gruol must be prepared and then Agnihotra offered. 2161 This is an example showing that arthakrama is more powerful than pathakrama (PM8 V.4.1). The Parāśarasmrti lays down that every day one should perform sandhya (morning adoration ), bath, jape (montto ring of sacred texts ), homa, study of the Vedah, worship of gods, Vaiśvadeva and feeding guests. The Par. M. says that 2162 setting aside the pathakrama one must follow the suitability and therefore bath comes first and sandhyā afterwards. The 8m. C. quotes Vṛddhamanu to the effect that a childless chaste widow should offer pinda to her deceased husband and take hia wealth. Hore it is proper to hold that she should first take his wealth and then perform his sraddhas. In the Vajapeya the text says that the performer (yajamāna) has to tie to the sacrifoial post seventeen paśus to be offered to Prajapati (Tai. Br. I. 3.4.</p>

<p>2-3). It is also provided that each of the 17 paśus should have several samskāras performed on it such as proksana (consacra tion by sprinkling sacred water on it), upakarana (bringing near). One may take any of the 17 animals first and begin to perform the first of the samskaras on it; but having once begun with a particular animal he must perform the second and other samakāras one after another on the same animal; 1.o, the order of the samskāras on an animal is determined by the commence ment. Kānda or sthāna is exemplified as follows: The Jyotiṣ toma is the model sacrifice (prakrti) of which Sadyaskra is a vikrti (modification ). It is prescribed by the Veda in the case of Sadyaskra that all animals should be sacrificed together at the savanlya stage. 2163 In Jyotistoma, there are three animals offered viz.&lsquo;agpisomiya&rsquo; in the morning, &lsquo;savanlya&rsquo; in the noon and&rsquo; anubandhya&rsquo; in the evening. Sādyaskra, being a vikyti, all these have to be performed in it; but the particular text about it provides that all three must be sacrificed together at the savanīya stage. This ( offering all three simultaneously) is im possible and therefore all that can be done is to offer (them) one after another (and not at three different times in the day); it would appear at first sight that the Agaisomiya paśu comes first; but that is not so, since simultaneous offerings being laid down at the savanlya stage in sadyaskrayāga, the advaniya pasu is to be first offered (and not Agnizomiya) and then the Agnizomiya immediately after and then Anubandhya or those two may be offered in any order one likes (but immediately).</p>
<p>An example of sequence being determined by the mukhya (first or principal ) is : there is a śruti passage &lsquo;two Sarasvata, offerings are to be made; this is indeed &amp; divine couple&rsquo;, 2864</p>

<p>Details are provided as ragards the two oiterings to Saragvati and Sarastata. The doubt arisas : ara the details about the offer ing to be made to the female deity to be performed first or are they to be first performed as the offerings to the male deity ? The prima facie. view being that as no sāstra exists rogulating priority ons may do as one likes, the established conclusion is that the order of sequence in the case of the detaile should be determined by the order of the Yājyāpuvākyā verges. These are mentioned first about the fomnale deity in the words &lsquo;pra po devi Sarasvati&rsquo; (Tai. S. I. 8. 22. 1, Rg. VI. 61. 4). Therefore, the conclusion is that in the details also the offering to the female deity should come first.</p>
<p>In PMS V. 1. 16 it is decided that the order expressed in mantras should be followed in preference to the order contained in Brābmapa texts. 2165 The Darsapūrpamāga sacrifice is made up of three component sacrifices, Agaeya, Upimsu and the Agni somlya. In Tai S. II, 5, %. 3, the Agoisomlya sacrifice is first described and in Tai, II, 6. 3. 3 the Agaeya is described Bat these are held to be Brāhmaṇa texts, though now appearing in the Sambitā toxts, since they lay down a vidhi; but in the Mantra pātha the Agneya mantra &lsquo;Agnir-tūrdhā&rsquo; (Tai B. IIL 5.7.1) is first set out and then follows the mantra Agossomā savedasi (Tai. Br. IIL. 5, 7.2). Therefore, the Āgneya is to be first per formed and the Agaisomlya afterwards.</p>

The former way is called kāṇdānusamaya and the latter &lsquo;padārtbānu samaya &lsquo;,2166 Jai. V.2.7–9 refers to the first method and Jai. V.2. 1-3 to the 2nd.

I. 232 (&lsquo;apasavyam tataḥ kṣtvā ) the Mit. remarks that the performer of Śrāddha follows the kāṇdānusamaya method for the Vaiśvadeva brāhmaṇas i. e. gives them water for washing the feet, then acamana, seat, sandalwood paste, flowers &amp;o, then he should wear the sacred thread on the right shoulder and offer the upacāras to the pitrya brāhmanas.</p>
<p>The sixth adhyāya of PMS is a very interesting one. It deals with the various aspects of the question of adhikara, that is, qualifications of the performar of a sacrifice. It is a very exten sive chapter having eight pādas like chap. III and X. A few of the numerous propositions contained therein that have influenced the works ou Dharmaśāstra have already been set out, such as women&rsquo;s right to participate in Vedic sacrifices, śūdra&rsquo;s ineligibi lity for them, the rathakāranyāya and niṣādasthapatinyāya and a fow more will be dealt with here. As a preliminary Jaimini establishes (in P. M. S. VL 1.1-3) that in such texts as *one desirous of heaven should offer the Darsapūrpamāsa sacrifice or one should offer the Jyotistoma sacrifice&rsquo; the Veda prescribes yāga for one who desires heaven i. e. heaven is the principal (or predominant) factor while yāga is subsidiary or subordi. Date; thereby it follows that the Vedic text lays down the characteristios of the performer. The Pupṭikā says that 1268</p>

<p>adhikari is the owner (or master) who stands above all aotions (vāga). Another more elaborate definition is given as adhikari is one who desires some reward (such as heaven or happiness ). who is possessed of the oapaoity to perform the act prescribed, who has learning and who is not excluded from performing a sacrifice (by Sruti). Even lower animals desire happiness: hence to exclude them the words possessed of the capacity&rsquo;so. are added. A man may be totally ignorant and so the word&rsquo; vidvan&rsquo; is added ; a śūdra may desire happiness, may have capacity and be also learned but he is excluded by the vedio Loxt, Therefore the Sudra is not fit (or ordained) for sacrifice'.</p>
<p>In VI. I. 39-40 it is established an68 that every man belong. ing to one of the three higher classes has &amp; right to perform Vedic sacrifices. A man though at one time devoid of wealth may acquire wealth by various means. Similarly, it is said in</p>
<p>VI 1.41 that one who is defective in a limb is just like one who in devoid of wealth i, e. such a man has a right to offer Vedlo Bacrifices provided he takes steps to remove the weakness. In VI. 1. 42 it is further provided that if the defect is congential and incurable, the person who suffers from such a defect is not entitled to perform Vedic sacrifices.</p>

<p>1319</p>
<p>The ancient and medieval Hindu law of inheritance and BUOopssion was modelled on this. Vide Yaj. II. 140, Manu IX. 201 and Narada ( dāyabhāga, verses 21-22). Yaj. II, 140 declarea that the impotent, the outcast and his son, a lame man, a lunatio, an idiot, a blind man and a person afflicted with an inourable diseage are not entitled to a share, but are entitled to receive maintenance. This subject has been dealt with in of Dh. Vol. II. pp. 610-612. The Mit, on Yāj. II. 140 provides that the grounds of disqualification apply to males and females alike. But the recent Hindu Succession Act (No. 32 of 1956) sweepg away all these grounds of disqualification by providing that no person shall be disqualified from succeeding to any pro perty on the ground of any disease, defect or deformity or, save as provided in this act, on any other ground whatever ( section 28).</p>
<p>A good many sūtras (in chap. VI. 3. 17-41) deal with what are called &lsquo;pratinidhi&rsquo; (substitute, representative or proxy). These have been described in H. of Dh. Vol. II. pp. 684&rdquo; 1110, 1203, Vol. III, pp. 471, 637, 653. 654 (where Satyāṣādha Śr 8. III containing similar rules is mentioned). A few of them are briefly mentioned here. The first rule is that if the substance declared by the Veda for preparing an offering parishes or is lost as regards an obligatory rite or as regards kāmya rite that is already begun, one should substitute another substance (liks nivāras, wild rice grains ) for vrihi (rice grains) or yava i.e, barley grains and finish the rite (VI. 3 13–17). In some cases Vedic texts presoribe a substitute for the substance required to be used, as in . if he (the performer ) cannot obtain the Soma plant, he should substitute pūtika stalks and extraot juice therefrom.&rsquo; It is argued by the objeotor that, as the Veda expressly substitutes pātikas for soma, one should conclude that where Voda does not expressly mention &amp; substitute for &amp; prescribed substance, it means that a substitute is not allowed by the Veda in other cases. The siddhanta is that the prescribing of pūtikas as substitute is a restrictive rule 169 vie that although sovoral plants may resemble soma, there is &amp; restriction that only pūtikas should be substituted. It is provided (in III. 6. 37, 39) that when a substitute like nsvāras is employed, the subsidiary aots of sprinkling with water, pounding with mortar and pestle that are performed on rice or barley grains should also be per</p>

<p>formed on them. When rice grains are amployed the mantra expressly speaks of the rice offering as the sap or essence of rios graing. There adaptation (ūha) is to be made an &lsquo;pivāranim medha&rsquo; (vide PMS IX. 3. 1-2). 2170 But in certain cases no substitute is allowed viz. the devatā with respect to which an havis (offering) is prescribed cannot have another substituted iz &amp; rite e. g. &lsquo;Agneyoṣtakapālah&rsquo; cannot be changed into &lsquo;aindrostakapālaħ&rsquo;, since in that case the rite will cease to be what was intended. Similarly, when the text says &lsquo;be offers into the Ahavaniya fire, one cannot substitute the Gārbapatya fra: another mantra cannot be substituted for the one prescribed por can other sites be substituted for the Prayājas &lsquo;gamidho yajati&rsquo; &amp;c.). 271</p>
<p>The Veda forbids the use of varakas, kodrains and māṣas as unfit for a sacrifice. If a person mistakenly takes maṣa grains or particles believing them to be mudya graing or particles and uses them in a sacrifice in which an oblation of boiled mudga pulse is prescribed, he will not be performing the desired rita as what is forbidden as unfit cannot be &amp; substitute. 2172</p>
<p>This pyāya is relied upon by the Mit on Yāj. II. 126 (which simply states that if joint family properties are sup pressed or concealed by some members and kept for themselves, they should be distributed in equal shares even after partition (when this is found out), which holds that this verse cannot be interpreted so as to absolve the concealer of such joint property from guilt simply on the ground that he was himself a part owner and explains that just as a sacrificer mistakenly believing māsa particles as mudga ones loses the fruit of the sacrifice, 80 the concealer of joint property is guilty of wrong. The Vyavahā raprakāśa (p. 555 ) and Aparārka p.732 take the same view, but the Dāyabbāga (XII. 11-13) and V. R. (p. 526 ) are opposed to this ( vide H. of Dh, Vol III. p. 636 ). The Prayasoittatattva p. 482 has an elaborate note on this nyāya.</p>

<p>Another rule is that there oan be no substitute for the performer of the sacrifice (VI. 3.21 ), since (in Jai. TII, 7, 18–20 ) it is laid down that the fruit of the rite belongs to the owner, though after beginning the rite he leaves everything to the priests engaged to perform the rito. The only exception is in the case of satiras ( Jai. VI, 3.22 ) performed by many persons together acting both as performers and as priests.</p>
<p>One important adhikarana is VI. 7. 31-40, There is a Sattra called &lsquo;Viśvasṭjām-ayanam&rsquo; which is said to last for 1000 samvatsaras. After referrring to Tai, Br.

II p. 1246 n. 2683 for the Mahābhāṣya stating that the Yājnikas in speaking about such sattras only follow the tradition handed down by ancient Bages. Modhatithi on Manu I. 84 (*vedoktam-ayur-martyānām ) has a long note wherein he refers to the viw of Jaimini, quotos gatāyur vai puruṣaḥ&rsquo; and also satam-innu sarado anti devā'( Rg. I. 89.9) and oites the views of other interpreters, The Katyāyana Śr. (I, 6. 17-27 ) discusses this very subject at great length, refers to the differing interpretations of Bharadvāja, Kārṣṇājini and Laugākṣi but ultimately holds that samvatsara means' day &lsquo;here.</p>
<p>In the first six chapters of the P. M. S. the procedure of such rites as Darsapūrṇaināsa the details of which are expressly laid down by the Veda has been considered. In the six chapters from the 7th consideration will be given to sacrifices like Aindragna, the procedure of which is not expressly laid down by the Veda 2173 In the 7th chapter what is considered is whether in the vikśtis (sacrifices that are modifications of the model Bacrifices) details have to be added and, if so, which and how many of the details have to be carried out.</p>

<p>process or method by which the details prescribed in connection with one rite are taken beyond that rite and trapsferred to another. Sabara quotes from some ancient author a sloka defin ing atideśa. The sacrifice from which details are transferred is oalled praksli (model or Archetype ) and the sacrifice to whlob details are transferred or extended is oalled vikrti (or Eotype ). Atideśa may be provided for by vacana (Vedic text) or by the name. The first is of two kinds viz. by a direct statement or by an inferential process. For example, as regards a magio saorifice called Isu the text says, after speaking of some details, that the rest are the same as in 2174 Syena. An instance of an inferential racina is the extension to the Saurya sacrifice of the details of the Agneya in Darsapūrṇamāsa, because both are very closely connected and because no details are prescribed by the text about &lsquo;Sauryayāga&rsquo; (PMS VII, 4. 1). The name also is two-fold, viz. name of a rite and name of a rainskāra. The Māsāgnihotra prescribed (vide PMS II, 3. 24) in Kundapāyi nām-ayana is a different rite from the obligatory Agnihotra (as in &lsquo;yāvajjivan-agnihotram jubuyāt&rsquo;) as proved above, but the Dane&rsquo;agnihotra&rsquo; being common to both, the details of the usual Agnihotra (such as milking the cow, offering curds or milk, using a Khadira fuel stick &amp;c.) are to be extended to Māsāgai. hotra (Jai. VI. 3.1-4). Extension due to samskāra name is instanced in Jai.VII. 3. 12-15. In the Varupapraghāna (one of the cāturmāgyas), Avabhstha (bath) ia prescribed, but no details are added and therefore the requisite details are to ba taken from the rules about the Avabhștha in Somayāga, 2175</p>
<p>Atideśa is frequently resorted to by smrtis and digesta. For example, Yāj. I. 236 and 242 extend the procedure of Pindam pitryajña as regards Agnaukarang and offering of pindas to the Parvanaśrāddha. The Parāśarasmrti (VII. 18-19) speaks 176</p>

<p>Dardapūrpamisa ). The details of the praksti are to be perfor. med in all other iṣtis along with the few details that may have been stated expressly as to some.</p>
<p>The Jyotistoma is the praksti of all soma sacrifices of one day and of Drādaśābā and its details are performed in all modi fications of soma saorifices such as Atirātra. The Agnisomlya is the praksti of all sacrifices in which a pasu (animal) is to be sacrificed, the details of which are to be performed in all vikstis of pasuyāgas. Dvādaśāha is of two kinds, Ahina and Satira and is the prakrti of all Abida sacrifices like Dviratra, Triratra up to Satarātra; and Dvādaśaba of the sattra type is the model of all sattrag. Gavām-ayana is the prakti of all sacrifices like Adityānān-ayana. Darvihomas are sui juris and are not praktis or vikṛtis of any other saorificos. All these are consi dered in the 8th chapter.</p>
<p>The 9th chapter deals with tha (adaptation ). When applying the principle of atidesa certain alterations and adapter tions are necessary in the matter of mantras, sāmans and samskaras. The word ūba ordinarily means only tarka or vicaraṇā (reasoning), yet in PMS it has a special meaning. 3179</p>
<p>The Agneya is the praksli in which the nirvāpa (offering) is to be made with the words &lsquo;I offer to Agai what is liked by him&rsquo;; in the Sauryayāga, which is a vikfti of Āgneya, the offering has to be made with the words &lsquo;I offer to Sūrya what is liked by him.&rsquo; In the Vājapeya we read &lsquo;he offers to Bṛhaspati nirvāpa grains cooked on seventeen pans&rsquo;The Vājapeya is a modification of Darsapūrṇamāsa in which the grains of rice are sprinkled with water; therefore sprinkling has to be done on niyāra grains also (PMS IX. 2. 40). On the 2nd and following days of the Jyotistoma sacrifice there is recitation of the Subra hmanyā litany 2120 addressed to Indra by the Subrahmanya priest, beginning with the words &lsquo;Indra āgaccha, bariya āgaccha, Medhatither-mesa &amp;c&rsquo;. In the Agnistut sacrifice also there is</p>

<p>Adaptation of Subrahmanya-nigada</p>
<p>1325</p>
<p>Śgbara thereot, ir those are the Darsap</p>
<p>Subrahmanya-nigada 1181 addressed to Agni. In reciting it the word &lsquo;Agne&rsquo; is substituted for &lsquo;Indra&rsquo;; but the following words &lsquo;Harivaagaccha&rsquo;is are not to be changed and are to be recited. As they are attributes which may be predicated of Agni also (PMS IX.I. 42-44). The principle deduced by the Mimamsakas seems to be that, only if the words in the original mantra cannot at all be extended to the modified yāga as they stand, thon ūha may have to be resorted to but not otherwise. Sabara however, notes that the &lsquo;yājõikas perform ūha (i. e. adapt them by suitable changes) i.e.they recite &lsquo;agne agaccha rohitasva brhad-bhano&rsquo; etc.). It is noteworthy that, according to PMS II. 1.34 and Sabara thereon, a mantra as adapted (whita) is not called a mantra, since only those are mantras 2182 that are recognized as such by the learned. In the Darsapūrpamāsa when the priest takes out four handfuls of grains and puts them in a winnowing basket he repeats over three of the handfuls the mantra which literally means at the command of God Savits, with the arms of Asvins and with the hands of Pūsan I take out for Agni thee that art dear (to him)'.2183 The PMS holds (in IX. 1. 36-37 ) that the words Savity, Pūṣan, Asvin are not to be changed by ūba in the modifications of Darsapūrṇamāsa where the deity to which the offering is to be made is not Agni. Sabara agsigns rather far-fetched meanings to the words Savity, Aspins and Pūṣan ( as in the note below) and says that they are meant to eulogize the laying aside of the handfuls of grains for offering. There is another interesting case where there is no</p>

In the Dargapūrpamāsa there is a praiga (direotion) &lsquo;set dowa 2184 the water for sprinkling, put down the fuel stioks and the bunch of kuśa grass, olean the sruc and fruva ladles, gird up the wife of the sacrificer) and come out with clarified butter&rsquo;. Suppose the sacrificer has two or more wivos. Still the singular *patnla&rsquo; was to be used and not the dual or plural either in the model itself (IX. 3. 20) or in any modification thereof (IX. 3. 21). Dharmaśāstra works make use of ūha. The Viṣnu dharmasūtra provides that one should perform Sraddha of one&rsquo;s maternal grand-father and the latter&rsquo;s two male ancestors in a similar way by the ūha of the mantra, 3185 The mantra in the case of the śrāddha of male ancestors is &lsquo;Sundhantam pitarah (Ap. Śr. I. 7. 13), which should be changed into &lsquo;Sundbantim mātāmabāḥ&rsquo;; vide Mit, on Yaj. I 254 and H. of Dh. Vol. IV</p>

If boiled rice is destroyed or not available and nivūra grains are substituted, there is no ūha as &lsquo;n vārdpām medha&rsquo; but the words &lsquo;vribiṇām medha&rsquo; are to be retained (PMS IX. 3. 23–26), because, as stated in PMS VI 3. 27 ( sāmānyam tac-cik[rṣā bi ), olvāras are substituted on acoount of the similarity of parts of boiled nivāras with the parts of rice grains,</p>
<p>In the third and fourth padas of the 9th chapter there are twelve adhikaranas about the adhrigu-praisa recited by the Hots in Pasubandha Vide H. of Dh. Vol. II. p. 1121, note 2504 for that praiga.

<p>the total number of sūtras) just as the third (with 363 sutras ) and the 6th (with 349 sutras) have eight pādas each. This chapter is concerned with badha (annulment or exclusion) and abhyuccaya or samuocaya which is the exact opposite or anti thesis of badha. The general rule is that the details of the prakstiyāga (model sacrifice ) should be taken over in the vikyti (modification). But in some cases the vikṣti-yāga 2186 has a different name, some of the samskāras ( purificatory and embelli abing acts) and some of the substances ( dravya ) employed in the prakrti cannot be extended to the vikstig, because there are express texts negativing their employment or because they serve no purpose or have become useless or senseless. Sabara states that badha occurs when an idea or knowledge determined for certain as this type or that has to be understood as wrong owing to some ( special) reason while abh yuccaya (addition or combination) occurs when even after we have the knowledge that certain matters are to be extended to the vikrti there is the further idea that a few others also are to be additional in the viksti.</p>
<p>The Mai. 8. prescribes that one desirous 3187 of long life should offer a lump of one hundred krsnalas (golden pieces shaped as grains of rice) heated in clarified butter. But no pounding (avaghāta, threshing) is to be done in this, as the grains being made of gold, there is no chaff which can be separated by pounding (X. I. 1-3). Similarly, no upastarana 2188 (pouring of clarified butter) and abhighāranz (the subsequent pouring of olarified butter) are to be done, since in the model sacrifice these two are done for making the oblation to have a sweet flavour (X. 2. 3-11). A caru of rica has to be boiled (i. e. the heat of fire is to be applied to it). In the same way the golden pieces are to be heated in clarified butter by fire (X. 2. 1-2). The golden pieces have to be suoked like sugarcane pieces (X. 2. 13-16), because they cannot be eaten while in the</p>

<p>model sacrifice idā and prūśitra 2189 are actually eaten. In a magio rite like syena reeds are spread on the ground and not kuśa grass (as in the model sacrifice). This badha is due to a special text. 2190 The general rule in vedio sacrifices is that priests have to be chosen sad da kṣiṇā is to be paid to them at the end but sattras are an exception, since in sattras all are priests as well as performers (yajamānas). Here the exolusion of varuna (choosing) is due to the fact that in the other sacrifices the yajamāna and priests are different and the latter are engaged for fee. There is &amp; visible purpose in select ing or engaging priests, 2191 but in a sattra where ex hypothes all are yajamānas and priests as well, there is no visible purpose in going through the ceremony of choosing priasts (rtvig. varapa).</p>
<p>One example of gamucoaya may be given. In the Vājapoya (which is said to be a form of Jyotiṣtoma according to PMS III, 7. 50-51 ) seventeen animals are to be sacrificed. In the model sacrifice (i e. Jyotistoma) also there are certain animals to be offered. The question is whether there is badha of the paśus prescribed in the prakstiyāga or whether there is combination (samuccaya). The conclusion is that there is samuccaya (X. 4.6 ), because in the Tai. Br. there ocour passages like this &quot; Tha Brahmavādins say why is it that all sacrificial rites are</p>
<p>contained in Vājapeye&rsquo;? He should reply by means of pasus, viz he sacrifices an animal to Agoi, thereby he contains Agaiṣ. toma, he contains the Ukthya &amp;c.&rdquo; This shows that he has to sacrifice also other animals besides the seventeen. 2193 The Mit</p>

<p>The Tantravārtika ( on PMS III. 3. 14 pp. 859-860) collecks together about three dozen cases of bādha in general not dependent on either the conflict between śruti, linga &amp;o. or not falling under the bādha instanced above. They are &lsquo;inference and such appearances as mirage are dispelled by or invalidated by direct perception, deceptive means of knowledge by the six means of knowledge, smrti by śruti, a contradiotory and untrust worthy smrti by a trustworthy and uncontradicted smrti, a smrti with a visible purpose by another with an unseen purpose &amp;o.&rsquo;.</p>
<p>There is in the 10th chapter an important topic about dakṣiṇā ( sacrificial fees). In X. 2. 22-28 it is established that dakṣiṇā is to be given not for an unseen purpose ( adṛsta ) but for engaging the priests to perform rites required in sacrifices. In II. 8 1-2 it is established that the yajamāna ( the svāmin ) is to engage priests for sacrifices except where &amp; vedic text expressly directs otherwise (as in Tai. 8. V. 2.8.2). In X. 3. 39 the items of dakśiṇā are set out from Tāṇdya XVI. 1. 10-11; it is held that the words &lsquo;dyādaśasatam dakṣiṇā&rsquo; mean 2193 that the cows are to be 112 (X. 3, 39, 49 ) and in X. 3. 50 it is provided that the yajamān, should himself distribute the fees and X. 3. 55 sets out the method of distribution. All priests are not to receive equal shares. The four principal priests are hot, adhvaryu, 2194 udgāt; and brahmā and each of these four hava three assistants arranged in a certain order set out in the note below. Suppose there are one hundred cows to be distributed</p>

The assistants immediately after all four priacipals are called ardhinah (they got half of their principal, they being Harraut, wa TRATAT, GMT and ear), the thirds in each group of four constitute what are calicd trtiyinak (they get 3 of what their principals get, they being 1974, aer, smeti, magat), the last in each of the four groups are called pādinaḥ (they get one-tourth of what their principale get, they being मावस्तुत, उलेता, पोता and</p>

<p>as fee. Each group of four is assigned 1/4 1. e. 25 for hota and his assistants, the hotā getting 1% and the other three getting reapectively 6, 4, and 3 i.e. they get respectively half, 1/3 and 1/4 of what their principal gets. The same&rsquo; method applies to the other three groups. The prima facio 2195 viow is that there should be an equal distribition of the fee (cows) as śruti does not lay down any unequal distribution; this is not accepted and it is proposed that the fee should be distributed in proportion to the work done by each. The established conclusion is that both the views are unacceptable and that the distribution should be in accordance with the meaning of the words &lsquo;ardhinah, 31% trtiyinaḥ and padinah&rsquo; employed by Sruti.</p>
<p>Manu (VIII. 210 ) mentions the method of the distribution of fees in Vedic sacrifices outlined above and extends ita prin ciples of division to men working jointly on such undertakings as the construction of houses &amp;c. 2197 Though the sūtra (samam syād-aśrutivāt) is only the pūrvapaksa view and not acooptad as to the distribution of the cows as fees in Vedic sacrifices, it has been frequently followed as an equitable rule by medieval Dharmaśāstra writers, The Sm. O. relies on it about the liability of sureties (II. p. 152), about equal shares between father and sons in partition (II. p. 260 ) and U. 285 (distribution of yautaka among unmarried daughters ), II, 404. Kullūka on Manu II. 1 (where 36 years are laid down as the period of studentship for mastering the three Vedas ) states, relying on the sūtra &lsquo;samam&rsquo; &amp;o. that thirty-six years should be equally distributed over the three Vedasākhas.

The Vyahāraprakāśa pp. 449 and 548 (on division of mother&rsquo;s yautaka stridhana by unmarried daughters ) refer to the rule of equal division.

<p>The eleventh chapter deals with tantra which embraces Cases where one aot serves the purpose of several other acts or rites. 2198 For example, there are three yāgas viz. purodāsa (cake) baked on eight potsherds for Agni, ourds for Indra and milk for Indra; one performance of the Prayājas serves these three (XI. 1.5–19 and XI. 1. 29-37). Adhana ( establishment of the sacred fires) is to be done only once and is not to be repeated in each iṣti, pasuyaga or somayāga (XI. 3. 2); the utensils required for Srauta rites are prepared only once and are to be kept till the death of the sacrificer (XI. 3. 34-42). 2199 All these are oases of tantra. The general rule is that the place, time and the per former as regards all principal matters in one composite rite such as Agneya and others in Darsapūrṇamāsa are one (XI. %. 1) and also that they are the same for angas (details); but in the case of the angas (details) the place, time and the performer may be different on account of express texts.</p>

<p>performed only once and not separately in the 04se of each component; this is tantra. But if the result follows from each of the component sacrifices geparately, then the subsidiary details should be performed with each one of those componente. That would be a case of āvāpa ( decentralisation or goattering). In the Darsapūrṇamāsa there are really two sets 2200 of saori fices, one called Darsa (on amavasya) and the other Parnamase. The subsidiaries prescribed for each are almost the same. Yet they have to be repeated with each of the two sets, the principal reason being that the two are performed on two different days separated by a fortnight, though the two sets together make one single sacrifice leading to a single fruit. Vide PMS XI, 2, 12-18 which is a case of ārāpa.</p>
<p>The Aveṣti is a sacrifice which is performed as part of the composite sacrifice called Rajasūya that could be performed only by Kṣatriyas. It is also an independent sacrifice that could be performed by any one of the three higher varpay. This is no part of the Rājasūya and is different from it, though the passage about it occurs in the midst of the description of Rajasūya. 2201 This is relied upon by the Nirpayasindhu in connection with the Navaratra from Āśvina 1st to 9th of the bright half. There were different views, vir. Devipuja was to be performed for 9 days or on 8th or 9th tithi (vide above p. 154). The Kalika purana quotes 2202 a verse about Devipuja on the 8th or 9th alone of Asvina (sukla) and the N. S. interprets it as a separate wor ship on 8th or 9th alone distinct from the whole Navaratra.</p>

<p>Sense of &quot; rājā&rsquo; in the Avesti text</p>
<p>1333</p>
<p>The game adhikarana where the Pūrvapaksa proposes that Raja means any one of any varpa who rules over a kingdom and oftere protection to the country and its cities, the siddhānta (PMS and Sabara) holds that &lsquo;rājā&rsquo; is a word expressive of a caste Viz. Kṣatriya, and this is referred to by several late Dharmasastra works like the Rājadharmakaustubha (p.5). The V. P. refers to this adhikarana and interprets the verse of Nārada viz. &lsquo;one who is an apostate from the order of ascetics would become the slavo of the king&rsquo; as providing that even a ksatriya apostate would have to be the slave even of a vaisya ruler, though the word &lsquo;rājā&rsquo; in the primary sepse means a kṣatriya yet in a secondary senge (lakṣanā) any one who protects subjets could be called rājā. The Par. M. discusses this adhikarana at great į length (1. 1. pp. 449–55). It may be noticed that the meaning of rājā&rsquo; as kṣatriya in early texts changed to any ruler of any class who protects the country and people ruled over by him, This change is brought out briefly in Tantravārtika on III. 5.26.</p>
<p>The 12th chapter deals with the topics of prasanga, vikalpa and the like. Prasanga occurs when something done in one place is helpful in another place also, just as when a lamp is lighted in a mansion it illumines the public road also. 2203 In connection with the Agnisomlya animal sacrifice an offering of pasupurodāsa (a cake of the meat of the animal sacrificed) in the words &lsquo;having offered the omentum of the animal to Agoi and Soma one offers &amp; pasupurodāsa oooked on eleven potsherds to Agni and Soma&rsquo;. The question is whether the details such as prayājas should be performed afrosh for this ar whether those details performed at the time of offering the omentum will suffice. The established conclusion is that the details already performed at offering pasu (amentum) will serve for the offering of the meat oake also, 2204 In such cases the place or time and performer are to be the same. This conclusion is relied upon in the Prāyasoittaviveka which says that when &amp; man performs the expiation for twelve year in connection with grave sins of</p>

<p>Vikalpa has already been dealt with above (pp. 1249-1252 ).</p>
<p>The preceding pages are enough to exhibit the main doctrines and some of the principal Mimāssā rules of interpreta. tion and the great influence that the Mimāmgā exercised for over two thousand years on Dharmaśāstra works from the Āpastambadharmasūtra to late medieval works like the Smrti tattva, Nirgayasindhu and Vyavahāramayūkha. An exhaustive treatment of the numerous technical torms, topics and principles of the mimāmgā would easily cover a thousand pages, would enormously add to the extent of this work and has to be given up here for reasons of space, if for no other reason.</p>
<p>The Mımāmsā rulas have been of considerable help to Dharmaśāstra writers. But it should not be supposed that application of the Mimāmsā rules is easy or that the rules always enable scholars to arrive at agreed or certain and definite conclusions. Apart from the schism betweon the Prābhākara and Bhātta schools already referred to above (on p. 1189 ) there are many circumstances which militate against the certainty and Usefulness of mimaṁsā conclusions. There are variant readings in the sūtras themselves (0. g. on I. 2. 9 there are three readings according to Tantravārtika p. 123, on 1 . 14 two readings &amp;ob. to Tantrav. pp. 128–129). Sabara omitted the sutra II. 4. 17 (vākyāsamavāyāt) and the Tantravārtika notes (pp. 895-897) that Sabara omits six sūtras after IIL. 4. 9. Sabara frequently mentions a predecessor called Vrttikara with great respect but differs from him in some cases (e. g. on I 1. 3-5), does not like his way of dealing with sūtras like II. 1. 32, 33 and VIII. 1. %. Sabara gives alternative explanations of the same sūtra (e. g. of I. 3. 4, VII. 4. 13, VIII, 1. 39). Sometimes he treats two or more sūtras as forming one adhikarana and alternatively treats one of them as forming a separate adhikarana (as in 1, 3.3, II. 2. 23-24). He proposes more than two explanations of the same sūtra viz. IV. 1.2. He puts forward two or more explana tions of the same adhikarana (as in IV. 3. 27-28, VIII. 3. 14-15 ___2205. एवमतुल्यरूपेषु पापेषु समानजातीयेषु विजातीयेषु वा गुरुपापोदेशेन वा वार्षिकादिरूपमायश्चिचे कते स्वल्पपापाना परोडाशयावेन प्रसहादेव कालिदेलाववादम The Tartautoernali 94. . p. 85.</p>

<p>of two sutras out of four), IX. 1.1, IX. 1. 2-3, IX. 1. 34-35, IX. 2. 1-2, LX. %. 21-24, IX. 2. 25-28 four explanations, X. 2. 30-31 three explanations, X. 1. 1-2 three explanations, X 4. 1-2 three explanations. On Visayo prāyadarsanāt' II. 3. 16 Sabera himself is at a loss as to what the doubt intended by the sūtrakāra is or what the sūtrakāra wants to establish and relies upon what the vittikāra says about the passage to be discussed and about the doubt that arises. Besides, Sabara and Kumārila differ about the subject matters of certain adhikaranas as in 1. 3. 3-4 ( where Kumārila gives on pp. 194-195 a different interpretation altogether after first accepting Sabara&rsquo;s view ), 1. 3. 5-7, I. 3. 8-9, I. 3. 11-14. Kumārlla shows scant respect for Jaimini by naming him without the honorific title &lsquo;bhagavān&rsquo; or &lsquo;ācārya&rsquo; on pp. 495, 650, 655, 895, charges Jaimini with composing sūtras not containing much substance (p. 895) and remarks that Jaimini&rsquo;s sūtra is improper or wrong (e. g. vide p. 1241 about IV. 2. 27).</p>
<p>Kumarila is often critical of Sabara&rsquo;s bhāsys and remarks dozens of times that the bhāsya is improper (ayukta) or deserves to be discarded, is unmeaning or absurd (asambaddha) as on pp. 165, 30% (upeksitavya ), 313 (asambaddha), 314, 66%, 710,731, 863 (asambaddha), 950,953, 1090–91, 1615 (bahavo doṣah), 1714, 1980, 2004, 2193, 2204.</p>
<p>Another circumstance that makes one entertain grave doubts about the universal validity and usefulness of the principles evolved by the PMS system must also be adverted to. The greatest students of Mimārosā arrive at entirely different conolusions on many points. Some striking cases may be referred to here. One of the most glaring of such cases is the interpretation of the short sūtra of Vagiṣtha 2206 (15. 5, na stri putram dadyāt pratigrhniyād vā anyatrānujñādbhartuḥ) &lsquo;a woman should not give or take a son in adoption except with the asgent of her husband.&rsquo; This has been interpreted in four different ways by works and authors about a Hindu widow&rsquo;s power of adopting a son. The Dattakamimāṁsā holds that no widow can adopt a son, because, the husband being already dead, no assent of his can be had at the time of adoption. Vāoaspati,</p>

</ol>
<p>1336</p>
<p>&amp; Maithila writer, was of the same opinion on the further ground that, as Vasiṣtha lays down that one about to take a son in adoption should, after having performed a home in the middle of his house with the vyāhrtis, take (in adoption) only him who is closely related and who is a kinsman and not remote (in habitation &amp;c.) and, as women cannot perform a homa with Vedic mantras, all women including widows have no power to adopt. But in Bengal, it was held that the husband&rsquo;s assent need not be given at the time of adoption and that it may be given long before the actual adoption. In Madras it was held that the word husband in &lsquo;except with the essent of the husband&rsquo; is only illustrative and that therefore the angent of the agnates of the father-in-law (husband&rsquo;s father ) or of the husband&rsquo;s agoatos would be enough to enable a widow to adopt. The Vgavaharama yūkha, 2207 the Nirnayasindhu and the Samskara-kaustubha hold that the absent of the husband is required for a woman whose husband&rsquo;is living and that a widow can adopt provided she has not been forbidden to adopt by her husband. For a detailed pre sentation of these four views and the case law, vide H. of Dh. vol III, pp. 668-674. The Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act (No. 78 of 1956 ) bas made far-reaching and radical changes in the Law of Hindu adoptions and section 4 of that Act overrulos all texts, rules or interpretations of Hindu Law or customs and usages as part of that law, except in so far as they may have baon expressly saved by that Act.</p>
<p>The Mitākṣarā and the Dāyabhāga, both steeped in Mimārsā lors, differ on numerous points, some of which are (1) The Mit. holds that property or ownership arises by birth, the Dayabhāga denies it and says it is on the death of the previ ous owner or by partition; (2) superior right to inherit depends on religious efficacy according to the Dayabhāga, wbile nearno88 of blood relation is the determining factor according to the Mit; (3) Members of a joint family hold family property in quasi severalty and can dispose of their shares even before partition according to the Dāyabhāga; the Mit does not say 80; (4) 800. to Dāyabhāga even in a joint family a widow succeeds to her husband&rsquo;s share on his death without male issue, while the Mit. does not accept this view.</p>

<p>In passing it may be stated that to oall the Act Hindu Adoptions Act' is a travesty and misnomer, It should have simply been called the Law of Adoptions in India and should have retained the ancient Hindu rules for Hindus as developed by the courts and should have been of a permissive character for all Indians like the English Statute (of 1926) on the adoption of children. The general Hindu law of adoption as developed in the authoritative smrtis and commentaries and the case law did not contemplate the adoption of a daughter (except when she was made in ancient times a putrikā) and to allow the adoption of a daughter when &amp; Bon was living throws to the winds the basic priniciple of the Hindu Law that a sonless man should adopt &amp; male as &amp; son for the sake of the presentation of piṇdas and water ( to the Manes) and for continuance of the family name ( sections 7 and 11 of the Act). The Act allows a woman (even if not married) to adopt to herself a son or daughter or both and under it a woman, if married, can adopt a daughter even if she has a son but a married woman cannot adopt a daughter if she has already a daughter or a son&rsquo;s daughter living at the time of adoption (sections 8 and 11). The Act does not recognize dvyāmusyāyang adoptions which were recognized by Sanskrit texts and also by judicial decisions. The ministers in the Govern ment and their followers ( most of the latter hardly know what Hindu Law was and has beon) were carried away by enthu siasm for equality of rights for both mon and women. As the Indian Union is now a welfare State and it is professed that laws are to be made keeping in view &amp; socialistic pattern, Govt. should have disallowed adoptions altogether or at least put great curbs on indiscriminate adoptions. Instead, they extended the scope of adoption among Hindus by allowing a man to adopt a daughter even when he bad &amp; son or sons and by allowing even unmarried women to adopt a son or daughter or both. This is against a socialistio pattern. If adoptions had been disallowed entirely or allowed within Darrow limits oases of escheat to Government for want of heirs would have been many and to that</p>

<p>extent a socialistic pattern would bave been advanced. There is no evidence to show that women were keen on the right to adopt &amp; son or daughter even when they were unmarried. The first prinoiple of introducing reforms in the existing law is that only strictly necessary changes should be put forward. Reformers and legislators should take to heart the advice of Mr. Aldous Huxley (in Ends and Means,' p. 30) that change as such is more or loss distressing to most human beings, that man&rsquo;s conser vatism is a faot in any historical situation and that social refor mors should abstain from making unnecessary changes or changes that are of startling magnitude. Legislators should not forget that when they introduce far-reaching changes to lessen hardships, real or supposed, deemed to be caused by exist ing social conditions, they very often create new problems fa the immediate future. To take a simple example, under the old Hindu Law all girls were to be married before puberty, though Manu (IX. 90 ) provided that a girl should wait for three years thereafter during which, her parents or relatives might select a bridegroom for her, but that if they failed to do so she may herself choose her partner. This was not a bad provision People however went in for child marriages for girls and the problem of spinsters never aroge. Thep over thirty years ago came the Child Marriage Restraint Act (XIX of 1929 ) whereby the legally allowed marriageable age for girls was fixed at 14. By subsequent amendments and by the Hindu Marriage Act (25 of 1955 ) the lowest marriageable age for girls is now fixed at 15. This Act of 1929 originally went a long way in raising the minimum age for the marriage of girls. Then, after the second world war, owing to economic stringency, and other factors, the tendency of marrying at a late age inoreased and now the problem of spinsters among Hindus has emerged and great difficulties about the marriages of grown-up women in middle class families are being experienood.Appendix to Section VII Chap.

A Vedic text states that vessels made of Varana and Vaikankata wood are fit for sacrifices, but a vessel of Varana wood is aot to be used for homa while one of Vaika kata cay be used. Both classes of vessels are subsidiary to sacrifices, but the text about not usiog Varana vessel in boma is of a gencral character. Therefore, one of the two clauses is not subordinate to the other, Hence Vaikankata vessels are to be used in yāgas in which homa is</p>

<p>SECTION VIII Relation of Sāikhya, Yoga and Tarka to Dharmaśāstra</p>
<p>CHAPTER XXXI Dharmaśāstra and Saṅkhya.</p>
<p>Sāokhya is one of the well-known six yarārenns (philoso phical points of view).</p>
<p>Saṅkarācārya in his bhagya 2208 on V. S. II. 2. 17 says that Manu and others who were deeply versed in the Veda took up to some extent in their works the doctrine of pralhūna being the cause of the world with the idea of relying on that part of its doctrine viz. the effect is (already) existent in the cause. Similarly, on V, S. I. 4.38 he says that great effort was made by the Sūtrakāra and himself for refuting the doctrines of the Sāṅkhya system (and not for the refutation of the theory of atoms being the cause of the world), since the Sāṅkhya system is near to the Vedānta as it accepts the view of the non-diffor. ence of cause and effect and as some Dharmasūtra writers like Dovala have had resort to it in their works. On V. S. II. 1. 3 Saṅkarācārya remarks that, though there are many smrtis dealing with metaphysical topics, great effort was made for the refutation of Saṅkhya and Yoga only, since the two systems are well-known in the world as means of securing the highest goal of man, as they have been accepted by śistas (respectable and learned people) and are supported by Vedic indications in their favour (as in svetāśvatara Up. &lsquo;tat-kāraṇam sānkhyayogabhi pannam&rsquo; VI. 13). It would be shown later on that Manu and Devala rely on and propound ( somo) Sāṅkhya doctrines.</p>

<p>Origin and development of Saṅkhya</p>
<p>1353</p>
<p>It would not be irrelevant to say a few words about the origin and development of the Saṅkhya system. This (rise of Saṅkhya) is one of the most difficult problems in Indian philo sophy. A good many works and papers have been written on the Saṅkhya system. 2109 As to what the original Sāṅkhya teaching revised in the Sāṅkhyakārikā of fśvarakrsna was, no generally accepted answer can be given. From the 5th century A, D. at least the Saṅkhyakārikā of Iśvarakrsna has been re garded as the foremost exponent of the Sārkhya. The Saṅkhya kārikā and a commentary on it were translated into Chinese about 546 A. D. by Paramartha, originally a brāhmaṇa of Bhāradvāja gotra and a śramaña from Ujjayini (vide BEFEO, 1904, p. 60). Saṅkarācārya on V. S. I, 4, 11 quotes the whole of the 3rd perse of the Sāökbyakārikā and the first quarter of it on V. S. I. 4. 8. But the Sāṅkhya system, it appears, went through several phases. Chinese sources say that there were eighteen Sāṅkhya schools (p. 2 of Johnston&rsquo;s &ldquo;Early Saṅkhya,&rdquo; quoting</p>
<p>Takakusu in BEFEO, 1904, p. 58).</p>
<p>There is the Saṅkhyasūtra or Saṅkhyapravacanasātra attributed to Kapila (published with two commentaries viz, that of Aniruddha and parts of the Tilā of Vedāntin Mahadeva edited by Garbe in B. I. Series 1881). This is a late work composed about 1400 A. D. as shown by Garbe in his Introduction and by</p>

<p>History of Dharmasastra 1880, VIII,OL. XXXI</p>
<p>Fitz-Edward Hall in his learned Introduction to the edition of the Saṅkhyaprayacana-bhāṣya (B. I Series, 1856). There is an edition of 23 sūtras called Tattvasamāsa with a commentary called Kramadipika in the Chowkhamba Sanskrit series whioh has also published several other brief late works that are passed over here. Several commentaries on the Saṅkhyakārikā have been published. The earliest appears to be the one translated into Chinese by Paramirtha about 546 A. D., which has been reconstructed into Sanskrit from the Chinese by the learned Pandit Aiyaswami Sastri and published (in 1944) in the Sri. Venkatesvara Oriental Series with a valuable Introduction; another commentary styled Mātharavștti was published (in 1922) in the Chowkbamba Sanskrit Series. Dr. Belvalkar (in ABORI vol. V. pp. 133-161) contributed a long and scholarly paper on the Matharavstti in which he holds that the Mātharavștti is the original of the commentary translated into Chinese by Paramārtha together with some accretions made from time to time, that Gaudapāda&rsquo;s commentary is a simplified abridgmont of the Matharavștti (p. 148), that the Mātharavștti cannot be placed later than 450 A D. (p. 155) and that Iśvarakļṣṇa cannot be assigned to a date later than 250 A. D. (p. 168). Prof. A. B. Keith in &lsquo;Saṅkhya system&rsquo; (p. 51 ) places Iśvarakrsna at a data not later thao 323 A. D. Another early commentary is the Yuktidspikā of an unnamed author edited from a single ma. by Shri Pulipabehari Chakravarti in Calcutta Sanskrit Series (1938). This is a very valuable commentary and has been very competently edited oven from a single ms, though there are a few gaps here and there. That commentary is replete with quotations and polemical discussions, mentions several Saṅkhya teachers who differed among themselves and whose opinions are cited on many topics. For example, vide under Vindhyavāsin below. It mentions some ācāryas that are hardly over mentioned in any Saṅkhya work. It frequently cites an author called Pañcādhikarana (vide pp. 6, 108, 114, 132, 144, 147, 148 where two Āryās apparently of Pañcādhikarana are quoted). Another hitherto unknown Sāākhyācārya mentioned by this com. is Paurika on p. 169 and p. 175, who holds the surprising view 2010 that there is a separate prailhāna for each Puruṣa. Patanjali is frequently mentioned on pp. 32 (who denied the existence of</p>

Pañoaśikha (p. 31 in the plural, p. 61, p. 175) is mentioned and one passage which is quoted in the Vyisa bhāṣya ( on Y. 8. 1.4) and ascribed to Pancaśikha by Vācaspati is quoted by the Yuktidipikā on p. 41 ds Śāstra. From pp. 113 and 129 it appears that the author of the com, was a Vedāntin, 2011 It is probable that he flourished between 500 and 700 A. D., since he quotes (on p, 39 ) Dinnāga&rsquo;s definition of pratyakṣa&rsquo; and is not cited by Vaoaspati and other commentators on the Bankhya.</p>
<p>. Gaudapāda composed a commentary on the 8. Kārikā but only on 69 verbes published in the Ch. S. Series. The Commentary called Saṅkhyatattvakaumudi by the famous writer Vāoaspati miéra was published in the Chowkhamba 8. 8. in 1919. A com mentary called Jayamangala ascribed to Saṅkarācārya (in the colophon) on the 8. Karikā was published at Calcutta in 1933 by Sri H. Sarma with a brief but interesting Introduction by Principal Gopinatha Kaviraj (vide also I. H. Q. Vol. V. pp. 417 431) where Sri H. Sarms tries to prove that the Jayamangalā is earlier than Vācaspatimiśra. Vijñānabhikṣu composed ( about 1550 A. D.) a bbāsya on the Saṅkhyapravācanasūtra. The Sātrakāra and Vijñānabhiksu make efforts to establish the impossible thesis that the teachings of the Saṅkhya system are not in irreconcilable conflict with the doctrine of a personal God or with the Advaita Vedānta. The Mātharavștti on 8. Kārika 71 furnishes the names of certain teachers that flouriabed between Papoagikha and Isverakrepa viz. Bhargava, Ulūka (Kausika ?), Valmiki, Harita, Davala and others, while the Jayamangala mentions Garga and Gautama 88, Saṅkhya teachers after Pangasikha (vide note one in Pandit Asiyaswami&rsquo;s edition on p. 99).

It is clear from the above that soveral teachers, in any case pot less than five or six, intervened between Pañoasikha and Isvarakropa. From a somewhat mutilated passage 2212 of the Yuktidipika (p. 175 ) it appears that at least ten persons intervened betweon Pañcaśikha and Isvarakrsna. If this be accepted and if Isvara krsna be assigned to about 250 A.D., then Pancasikha cannot be placed later than the first century B. C. and may be much earlier still. On teda ca bahudba kȚtam tantram&rsquo; (S. Kārika 70) the Yuktidipikā speaks of bhagavat Pancaśikha as daśama-kumāra&rsquo; (tonth son of Prajāpati ?) and states that he expounded the gāstra to many persons such as Janaka and Vasiṣtha and thereby identifies Pancasikha with the teacher Pancasikba mentioned by the Santiparva ( vide note 2186 below).</p>
<p>Vacaspatimiśra in bis commentary on the Yogasūtrabhāsya (II, 23 ) sets out eight alternative viows among Saṅkhya writers on the question of &lsquo;darśana&rsquo; and &lsquo;adarśana&rsquo; and remarks that the fourth out of the eight alternatives is the real doctrine of the Saṅkhyaśāstra.2213 From about the 5th contury A. D. the Sāṅkhyakārikā bas been regarded as the standard work on the Saṅkhya system. The 8. Kārikā itself states that the holy Śāstra was expounded by Kapilamuni to Āsuri, who expoundeda24 it to Pancasikha and the latter expounded the (Saṅkhya ) system to several disciples and that it came down to Isvarakrsna in a succession of teachers and disciples, who summarised it in Arya</p>

<p>Fundamental conceptions of Saṅkhya</p>
<p>1857</p>
<p>Verdes. Kapila-muni is here said to be the first promulgator of the Sāṅkhya.</p>
<p>Before proceeding further the most characteristic and fundamental conceptions of the standard Sāṅkhya must be set out. The most fundamental conception is that there are two entirely distinct esgences existing from eternity, viz. praksti (i. e. nature or matter) also called pradhāna and avyakta, and puruṣa (soul or spirit, the knowing subject). The 2nd fundamental conception is that puruṣas are many. Another most characteri. stio feature of the Saṅkhya system is the doctrine of three 2215 guṇas (factors) called sattva (light, intelligent), rajas (energetic, active, domineering), tamas (coarse, inert, enveloping, dark ). Pradhaps or prakrti or Avyakta is said to be constituted by the three guṇas (triguṇātmaka) when they are in equilibrium (Sattvarajastamasām sāmyāvasthā). The Sārkbya analysed all physical and mental phenomena. The lowest factor is the heavy impenetrable matter and coarse foolish impulses. They are called tamas (desoribed as guru, heavy and varanaka, enveloping). Then there is the factor of constant change in the physical world as well as in the mental. This is called rajag (cala, changing and upastambhaka, exciting, as the 8. Karika puts it). The third factor or element in the world is the varied operation of consciousness that leads to knowledge and experi ence, which is called Sattva (laghu, light as opposed to the coarse, merely material objects and prakāśaka, luminous, as contrasted with tamas). These three factors or elements combine in various proportions and make up the evolving universe. The three are called gupas from several points of view viz, they are qualities, they also bind as with a rope the Puruṣa to samsāra. The basis of the universe is to be found in the guṇas.

<p>is not different from the guṇas, but it is only the name of the primordial matter before evolution starts. Praksti being anādi and eternal, the Saṅkhya system did not postulate God 48 creator, and held God to be a superfuity. The Sinkhya propounds a theory of cosmic evolution which is practically as reasonable as any modern theory of evolution. It is probably the earliest attempt to furnish an answer from reason alone to the questions about the origin of the world, about the nature of man and his relation to the physical world and man&rsquo;s future destiny. In the nineteenth century mind and matter were held to be entirely dif. eront and atoms were supposed to be indivisible. Modern physics bas reduced matter to energy but the nature of this last also is a mystery. Under the Saṅkhya systom, puruṣu or prakpli or both serve no religious purpose. There is no definite or convincing answer as to why purusa becomes entangled in the web of praksti, The Saṅkhya simply says that as a result of non-discrimination puruṣa somebow becomes entangled. The Vedāntasūtra rofera to pradhāna as amārta in I. 2. 19 and as anumānika&rsquo; in I. 4.1. From Prakrti evolves mahūn (i. e, buddhi, consciousness ) from which arises ahankara, from which evolve on the one hand the five tanmātras (subtle elements, viz. sabda, sparsa, gandba, rasa, rūpa) and on the other hand manas (mind) and the ton indriyas (sense organs). From the five subtle elements are evolved the five great elements, earth, water, tejas, vāyu and akasa ( other ). These are twentyfour 2716 tattvas ( categories) and puruṣa is 25th. Pradhāna is distinct from puruṣa and sorves the purpose of puruṣa (who is passive and a sākṣi) who is distinct from the bvolutos of prakrti and is bhoktr (and not kartṛ). The Sāökhya 2017 does not admit God. PrakȚti and puruṣa come together in order that the latter may see its working; just as a blind man and a orip ple (a lame man) may come together (and the blind man may carry the lame man on his shoulder, the latter showing the way and both may reach their destination by this joint effort). 2018 When</p>

<p>puruṣa realizes the difference between himself 2219 and the guṇas constituting Prakrti he is liberated. Both Saṅkhya and Yoga treat the external world as real. They both postulate plurality of souls ( purugas), that are eternal and unchanging. This latter is one of the most crucial differences between Saṅkhya and advaita Vedānta. It is not necessary for our purpose in this chapter to go into greater details. One more doctrine of the Saṅkhya is called satkāryavāda i. e, the theory that the effect already exists in the cause and does not arise from nothing (8. Kārikā, verse 9); compare Chan. Up. VI. 2.2 ( kathamagataḥ sajjāyeta) and Gita I. 16 ( nāsato vidyate bhāvo).</p>
<p>It is difficult to assign a definite date to the Sāṅkhya kārikā. As Paramārtha treuslated the Karikā as well as com mentary on it into Chinese in about 546 A. D. the Karikā cannot in any case be placed later than about 250-300 A. D. It may be earlier by a few centuries. Umbeka in his common tary on the Slokavārtika of Kumārila mentions an author called Madhava as &lsquo;Saṅkhyanāyaka&rsquo; and Yuan Chwang also refers to &amp; Saṅkhya teacher called Madhava. Dr. Raghavan in</p>
<p>Sarūpa-Bharati&rsquo; (pp. 162–164) shows that Mādhava was really &amp; destructive critic of Sāökhya, that the proper reading is *Saṅkhyanāśaka-Madhava&rsquo; and that he was probably earlier than even Dinnāga and Dharmarkirti (i. e. earlier than 500 A. D.).</p>
<p>Saṅkarācārya in the passage quoted in n. 2208 remarks that certain Upaniṣad passages may be relied upon as apparently supporting the Saṅkhya system, Some of the Upaniṣad passages that either foreshadow Bankhya dootrines or employ words that have technical meanings in the Saṅkhya system would be</p>

<p>cited, 2220 But one passage from the Atharvaveda X. 8. 43 deserves notice, viz. the knowors of Brabma know that yakṣa endowed with atman which abides in the lotus with nine gates (the physical body ) covered by three guṇas.&rsquo; With this may be compared Śv. Up. III. 18 and Gita V. 13 ( navadvāre pure debi). The Mundaka Up, states From Him are born prāṇa, mind, all indriyas, the five elements, and sky, wind, jyotis (tejas ), waters and the earth.&rsquo; The Katha Up. refers to indriyas, the objects of senses, mind, buddhi, mahān, avyakta, puruṣa as &amp; rising series, similar to that of the Sāökbya with one exception viz. the Up. does not mention ahankāra and holds that buddhi and mahān are different, while the official Sāṅkhya identifies them. It is, therefore, clear that the evolution in these two Upanisads is very similar to the theory of evolution stated by the classical Saṅkhya, the only difference being that the Upa niṣads postulate a supreme Creator (that produces the cosmos ) while Sāṅkhya drops the creator and accepts the evolu tionary series only. On V. S. I. 2. 12 Saṅkarācārya citos the verse dva suparṭā sayujā&rsquo; (which is Mundaka Up. III. 1. 1, Sv. Up. III. 1 and also Rg. 1. 164. 20) and explains it, as referring to the individual self (jiva) and the Highest Spirit (paramātman). The ācārys then mentions the argument of a predecessor who relies upon Paingirakasys brāhmaṇa where the latter half of the verse is explained as mentioning sattva (buddhi) and kṣetrajñu (. e. the individual self). This indicates that some took that verse as putting forward Saṅkhya ideas. The Katha Up. III. 4 states that the description of the individual soul as the enjoyer (bhoktp ) results</p>

<p>Similarities between Upanigads and Saṅkhya</p>

<p>from the union of the atman with organs of senge and the mind. The Svetaśvataropaniṣad expressly 3121 refers to Saṅkhya and Yoga (in VI. 13) and says that &lsquo;on realizing that cause which can be apprehended by means of the study of Saṅkhya and Yoga he is released from all bonds&rsquo;. That Upaniṣad is full of words that are frequently employed in the Sāökhya system such as &lsquo;avyakta &lsquo;(1.8), guna (V.7 sa viśvarūpas-trigupaḥ&rsquo; and VI. 2, 4 and 16), jña (v. 2, VI, 17), prakrti (māyām tu praktim vidyāt&rsquo; IV. 10), puruṣa (I. 2, III. 12, 13, 1V.7). pradhāna (I. 10, VI. 10 and 16), linga (I 13, VI. 9). The Śv. Up. (VI. 11) describes the one God as &lsquo;sākṣi cetā kovalo nirguṇas-ca&rdquo;. The Saṅkhya denies God and transfers these epithets to the Puruṣa, who in his true essence is, according to the Sāṅkhya, merely a passive witness, pure intelligence, unaffected by guṇas. The Praśna Up. (IV. 8) speaks of the five elements and their matras (prthivi ca prtbivimātrā ca &amp;c), the ten indriyas and their objects, manas, buddhi, ahankara &amp;o. The Sāṅkhyas rely on the verde &lsquo;ajāmekām&rsquo;(Śv. Up. IV. 5)2222 for Upaniṣadic support to their theory about praksti and its three guṇas (vide bhāsya of</p>

<p>being (a male ) who resorts to her (loves her) and lies by her; there is another, who loaves her after having experienced enjoyment. Similarly, Saṅkhyas argue that Kapila, the founder of the Saṅkhya system, is mentioned in the Sv. Up. (V.2) &lsquo;it is he who, in the beginning, bears (nourishes) by thoughts Kapila sage when born and looks on while he is being born.&rsquo; If one looks to various passages of the Sy. Up, such as III, 4, IV. 12, VI.18 one must hold that șsi Kapila,2213 the reddish sage, is Hiranyagarbha (the golden child), the first creation (Hiranyagarbhaḥ samavartatāgre, Rg. X. 121,1). Saṅkarācārya (on V. S. II. 1.1) replies that from the mere occurrence of the word &lsquo;Kapila&rsquo; one cannot at once jump to the conclusion that he must be the founder of the Sinkhya, since another Kapila, called Vāsudora, who reduced to ashes the sons of Sagara by his angry look, is well-known.2224 Saṅkarācārya concedes on V. 8. II. 1.3 that both Saṅkhya and Yoga are within the pale of Vedic orthodoxy as regards those portions of them that are not in conflict with the Veda. The five elements (mahābhutani) are mentioned in the Ait. Up. (III.3), Praśna VI. 4 and the five special qualities of these five in Katha Up. (III. 15).</p>
<p>In view of the fact that the word &lsquo;Sāṅkbya&rsquo; occurs in the Sv. Up, and that the Katha and Muṇdaka have some doctrines similar to the Sāṅkhya system and the Svetāśvatara employs many words that occur frequently in the works on Saṅkhya, the question arises&ndash;what is the relation of the Saṅkhya to the Upaniṣads. There are three possible views, (1) that Upe nizad thought and Sāṅkbya made parallel progress, (2) that Sinkhya adopted and expanded some of the germinal ideas</p>

<p>Relation of sāṅkhya to Upanigads</p>
<p>1863</p>
<p>of the Upaniṣada, (3) that some Upaniṣads borrowed from the Saṅkhya. It is not possible to discuss these questions here for reasons of space and relevance. The present author holds that it is the Saṅkhya that based itself on the thoughts of the Upanigads, particularly when the older Upaniṣads like the Br. Up. and Chandogya hardly exhibit any traces of Saṅkhya doctrines or technique, when Saṅkhya reference are found only in Katha, Mundaka, Svetāśvatara, Praśna (which are held to be later than Chān. Up. and Bṛ, Up. by modern scholarship) and when there is hardly any work or writer of purely Sāṅkhya doctrines that can be assigned to &amp; period even a few centuries earlier than the Christian era and when no one can place the principal Upaniṣads (about twelve, including the Svetāśvatara) later than 300 B.O., since even the Sv. Up. is referred to as</p>
<p>Śruti&rsquo; in V, s. I. 4. 8, II. 3. 22. Garbe (in &lsquo;Die Sāökhya Philosophie&rsquo; pp. 3 ff) denies that Saṅkhya underwent any essen tial modifications in its long history. Jacobi does not agree, holding that Saṅkhya originated out of a common cultural and philosophical heritage and Oldenberg goes the origin of Sāökhya in the Katha and Sv. Up. and holds that epic Saṅkhya is an independent development (Die Lehre der Upanishaden uöd die Anfānge des Buddhismus&rsquo;, 1915, pp. 206 ff). Saṅkhya and Yoga were known to Kautilya (Saṅkhyam Yogo Lokāyatam cetyanyikṣiki' Arthaśāstrā I. 2. p. 6.). Therefore, we may say that Saṅkhya as a philosophical school started at least before the 4th century B. O.</p>
<p>We should now turn to Sanskrit works other than the Upaniṣads for seeing the origins of the Saṅkhya system. First comes the Mahābhārata.</p>
<p>In many passages of the Santiparva 1225 references to some of the doctrines, technical words and persons connected with the mature Saṅkhya system occur. The references are so many that the present writer will bave to select only a few passages by way of sample. In chap. 203 there is a dialogue between &amp; clover pupil and his guru. It begins by stating (in verse 8) that Vasudeva is all this (Vāsudevaḥ sarvam-idam), then it proceeds just as from one lamp thousands of lamps can proceed, so prakrti</p>

Then the chap. mentions five organs of knowledge (ear, skin, eye, tongue, sense of smell) and five senges of activity (bands &amp;c) and then there are the five objects of senso (Viz. sabda, sparsa &amp;c) and the mind is all-pervading and the 16th (verses 27-31). Then the chapter speaks of purusa (the soul) that resides in the city with nine 2277 gates and is undecaying, and immorlal, which abines in all beings just as a lamp, whether big or small, doos. In chapter 204 the same dialogue is pursued and the first verse says all bhilas spring from aryakta and are merged (die) in aryakla, it refers to kṣrtra (the body ) and kṣetrajña (in verse 1+) and winds up by saying that, just as seeds burnt by fire do not grow, the soul is not again connected with klesas 2723 when they are burnt by the fire of (correct) knowledge. In chap, 205, verges 22-23 speak of the characteri. stios of the three gunas; chap. 206 says that when a person brings under control anger, avarice, 2229 fear, pride and becomes pure he merges into the highest self that is Viṣnu in aiyakta form and chap. 207 deals with the measures for reaching the highest goal and puts forward brahinac arya (sexual purity) as</p>

<p>the first measure. . In these chapters, though some dootrines peculiar to the standard Saṅkhya of the Kārikā appear, they are all brought in line with the Vedānta of one supreme Being, which is negatived in the official Sāṅkhya.</p>
<p>That there were philosophers, who adopted some of the Saṅkhya and Yoga doctrines, postulated Paramośvara ( Supreme Deity) and held that the three, viz. Pradhāna, Puruga and Isvara were different from each other, is expressly stated by Saṅkarā darya 330 in his bhāsya on V. 8. II. 2. 37. Therefore, the Mahā bhārata references to Saṅkhya probably relate to philosophical doctrines in which all three viz. Prakrti, Puruṣas and Supreme Self were recognized, from which arose the later official Saṅkhya that discarded any supreme Ruler of the Universe. In the Nārāyaṇīya section of the Santiparva (quoted in note 1544 p. 954 above ) &lsquo;Sārkhya, Yoga, Pāvoarātra, Vedas and Pasupata are said to be knowledges ( jõānāni) and &lsquo;pānāmatāni&rsquo; (different points of view) and Kapila, &amp; paramarṣi, is said to be propounder of Saṅkhya. Chapter 294 (in verses 26-49) deals with the twenty-five tattvas of the Saṅkhya from Prakçti or Avyakta, mahat, ahankāra, the five elements from abankāra (these eight being called prakstis) and then 16 vikāras (Verse 29). These are called kṣetra, the soul is the 25th (v. 35) and is called kṣetrajña and Puruṣa ( v. 37&rsquo;avyaktake pure śete purusas-ceti kathyate&rsquo;, and Isvara or brahma is not brought in anywhere in that chapter.</p>
<p>Chapters 211-212 (containing in all 100 versen) of Santi parva deal with what Janaka, called Janadeva, 1231 king of Mithila, learnt from Pancaśikha, when the latter, after wandering over the whole earth, visited Mithilā and who is described as the first (or foremost) pupil of Āsuri and who is said to have performed &amp; sattra for a thousand years on Pañoasrotas 2232</p>

<p>History of Dharmalāstra (Soo. VIII, OL. XXXI</p>
<p>(verse 10). He was the son of a brahmana woman called Kapila and was therefore known as Kapileya (verses 13-15). Janaka had a hundred acāryas in his palace who propounded the diffaront views of different sects. Vorse 9 says that Pañcaśikha made people wonder when he appeared like Kapila, the great sage ( paramarṣi) and Prajāpati, that he oonfounded the hundred ācāryas by his arguments (v. 17). Later Janaka abandoned those ācāryas and followed Pañcaśikha (verse 18). He, after creating disgust in Janaka about his caste or about rites and about everything, expounded to Janaks the highest mokșa which is declared as Saṅkhya. In chấp. 212 Pancaśikba expounds five elements, five jñānendriyas, five karmendriyas, mind (verses 7-22) and the signs (lingas) of sāttvika, rājasa and tāmasa bhāvas (verses 25–28) and describes bow a person who seeks the Self is freed from the fetters of pleasure and pain and being beyond the fear of old age and death reaches immortality. In the first place, these two chapters are not sometimes very clear, offer no consistent cloar-cut system and employ words that are difficult to construe and are not completely identical with the scheme of the 25 tattvas of the official Sāṅkhya of the Kārika, since chap. 211 verse 13 speaks of &lsquo;ekāksara brabm8 assuming many forms&rsquo;. For example, it is difficult to say what is meant by &lsquo;purusārastham-avyaktam&rsquo;. The meaning that can be drawn out of the words seems to be &lsquo;he (Pancasikha) conveyed knowledge (to Janaka) about Avyakta (i.e. Pradhāna) that depends upon Puruṣa (i. e. that becomes active through union of Puruṣa with it), which is the highest truth. It further says that Pancaśikha became perfect (in knowledge) by the performance of istis and sattras, again by abounding tapas, had a vision of the deity ( God) and he realized the distinction between kṣetra and ksetrajña and also realized brahma symbolized 2233 by om.

<p>Paficaśikha&rsquo;s doctrines ant Saṅkhya</p>
<p>1367</p>
<p>fore, the doctrine of Pancaśikha in these chapters of Śāntiparva is really advaita (monism) on which are grafted some doctrines similar to the later official Saṅkhya for explaining creation and so forth.2231 In Santiparva 306. 56-66 ( = Chitra ed, 318. 58-62) Visvāvasu tells Yājñavalkya that he has heard about the 25th tattva (i. e. Purusa) from Jaigiṣavya, Asita-Devala, Vārṣaganya (of Parāśara gotra ), Bhṛgu Pancaśikha, Kapila, Suka, Gotama Arṣṭiṣopa, Garga, Nārada, Āguri, Pulastya Sanatkumāra, Sukra and Kaśyapa (father of Viśvāvasu ) and 336.65 (Chitra. ed. 318. 67 ) states that Yājñavalkya had mastered completely both sānkhya and Yoga. Sāntiparva 304. 4 (=316. 4 of Citra. ed.) states that Saṅkhya and Yoga are one. 2235</p>
<p>Pancaśikha figures frequently in the Mahabharata. In Sāntiparva, chap. 307 ( containing only 14 verges) Yudhisthira asks Bbiṣma how one can rise superior to old age and death,</p>
<p>(Continued from last page) but from the passages in the Ahirbadbnya-sambitā, chap. XII. 18–29 it follows that the doctrines of Kapila&rsquo;s Sāṅkbya-tantra were divided into two mandalas called Prākta and Vaiksta aod the two bad 32 and 28 topics respectively. &lsquo;ACTRIU Hout Beurer: FUSTET: I gidat TEAT: Met zo मेऽखिलम् । षष्टिभेदं स्मृतं तन्त्रं सांख्य नाम महामुने । प्राकृत कृतं चोते मण्डलेवे समासतः ।।. The com. Arjunamiśra appears to take it as the great doctrine of Kapila came to him (Pancasikba) in the form of an aura of light and expounded to him the bighest trotb&rsquo; etc. This is extremely far-fetched. There is a doubt about the agent of dyabodhayat and as to whom &lsquo;damāsinam&rsquo; refers. To me it appears that the meaning is that Pancasikba came to him (i, e, to Tapaka) and in parted to bim the great Kapila mandala, the highest truth, the avyakta etc. According to the usual sanskrit construction the agent of &ldquo;Zgamya&rsquo; and &lsquo;ayabodbayat&rsquo; must be the same (i. e. Pañcasikba). Foreitā refers to जनक. Compare &lsquo;एकाक्षरं परं ब्रह्म। मनु II. 83 and &lsquo;ओमित्येकाक्षरं ब्रह्म SYTETET ATHETE&rsquo; fra VIII. 13. Verse 13 of chap. 211 is surtig aftan प्रतिपेदे ताब्ययम्। (अन्ययं refers to एकाक्षर-ब्रह्म). Therefore, मण्डल should be taken to mean &lsquo;the circle of the doctrines first propounded by Kapila.&rdquo;</p>

<p>History of Dharmasastra (Bec. VIII, Ch. XXXI</p>
<p>whether by very great tapas 2236 or by rites or by Vedic learning or by the use of rayāyanas (Blixirs of life or alchemist&rsquo;s prescrip tions ). BhIṣma speaks of an ancient dialogue between Janaka and Bhikṣu Panoaśikha, where the same question was put by Janaka and Pancaśikha replied that none can escape these two and that union with wife and relatives is like meeting persor.s when on a journey (i, e. the company of these is not durable or permanent), nobody has seen heaven or hell, that one&rsquo;s duty is not to violate the ordinances of Vedas, and to make gifts and to offer sacrifices. In this chapter there is hardly anything which approaches the special doctrines of the Sāṅkbya, though Pancaśikha&rsquo;s views are liere set forth. Chap. 308 ( 191 versos out of which less than 30 have anything to do with Pancaśikha&rsquo;s teachings directly) begins with the question of Yudhisthira &lsquo;who secured mokṣa without giving up the stage of householder.&rdquo; Then Bhiṣma narrates to him the dialogue between Janaka called Dharmadbvaja 2337 and Sulabhā, a nun. Janaka was learned in the Veda, in mokṣaśāstra and in his own sāstra ( rajadharma), he had controlled his senses and ruled the earth. She heard from ascetics about Jadaka&rsquo;s righteous conduct and she desired to find out the truth. She gave up her form as &amp; pun by her yogic powers and became a woman, a paragon of beauty, and met Japaka. The latter informed ber that he was the pupil of old bhikṣu 2238 Pancaśikha of the Pārāśarya gotra who stayed with him during the four months of the rainy season and who expounded to him the threefold moksa (viz. Sāökhya, Yoga and the science of government) and yet who did not ask him to give up rulership. Janaka said</p>

<p>&ldquo;I, giving up all attachment, though occupying the highest position ( as ruler), follow the three paths of mokṣa; the highest rule of this mokṣa is &lsquo;freedom from attachment, the absence of attachment is due to correct knowledge whereby one is freod from bondage (of samsāra)&rdquo;. Janaka further avows that 2239 on account of the knowledge imparted to him by the bhikṣu who ig. called after his top-knot, he is free from all attachment, though looking after the kingdom and that he is different froma other sannyāsing. Then Janaka gives in verges (308. 38-41) another meaning 2240 of the threefold Mokṣa propounded by Pancaśikha to him viz. (1) highest knowledge and renunciation of actions, (2) strict adherence to the patha of karma ( duties prescribed by Śāstra) and (3) combination of knowledge and actions, and it is said that those who follow this third path resemble householders in soveral respects. Janaka asserts his view.wearing ochre-coloured 2241 garments, shaving the head, carrying a water-Vossel placed on three staves those are merely outward signs and do not lead to mokṣa and that mokṣa does not consist in non-possession of wealth and bondage does not follow possession of some wealth, but it is jñāna by which a porson secures deliverance, whether there is possession or non-possession of wealth&rsquo;. It appears from verse 40 that Pancasikha emphasized the third kind of Mokṣaniṣtha (Jõānakarmasamuccaya) and Janaka followed that teaching. The rest of the chapter (308) is concerned with Janaka&rsquo;s charges against Sulabhā and Sulabhā&rsquo;s soathing remarks against Janaka.3242 She says at the end you</p>

<p>History of Dharmatāstra (860. VIII, Ch. XXXI</p>
<p>bayo indeed heard from Pañoaśikha the whole ( doctrine ) about moksa together with the means (for attaining it), with the Upaniṣad passages expounding it or with the auxiliaries (of meditation) and with definite conclusions.</p>
<p>This passage expressly refers to Upaniṣads in connection with mokṣa and the preceding verses emphasize the freedom from attachment on the part of Janaka (in 308. 37 &lsquo;mukts sanga&rsquo;). The Bṭ. Up. in III. 1 refers to the sacrifice performed by Janaka, king of Videha, who set apart a thousand cows to be given to bim from among the brāhmaṇas assembled at it, that would be the most profound in learning and be brahmiṣtha (most learned in or devoted to brahma). Yajāavalkys asked his disciple to take the cows away; thereupon followed a learned disquisition by questions (of angry brāhmaṇas including a woman ) and answers by Yājāavalkya; 2242 the questioners were Aśvala (the holy priest of Janaka ), Jāratkārava Artabhaga, Bhujyu Lābyāyani, Uṣasta Cākrāyapa, Kahola Kāuṣitakeya, Gargi Vācaknari, Uddalaka, Āruṇi, Vidagdha Śakalya (III. 1-9 ending with vijnanam-anandam brahma)&rsquo;. In Bṛ, Up. IV.% it is said that Janaka Vaideha approached Yājñavalkya, did obeisance to him and said&rsquo;instruct me&rsquo; and that then the sage spoke to bim &lsquo;you have studied the Veda and the Upaniṣads have been expounded to you by cāryas, but, when you will be leaving this body, where will yo go&rsquo;? Janaka replied that he did not know it and requested the sage to enlighten him on that point. Then a long disquition follows ( Bļ. Up. IV.2 ff) in which occurs the famous passage (&lsquo;sa aṣa aeti netyātmā, agshyo na hi gļhyate &hellip;&hellip; asango na hi sajjate &hellip;&hellip;. abhayam vai Janaka prāptosi&rsquo; (IV. 2. 4). It appears to the present writer that some one desirous of boosting Sāṅkhya teachings inserted the chapters about Sāökbya in which Pancaśikha is substituted in place of Yājñavalkya as the teacher of Janaka.</p>
<p>It would be seen from the brief synopsis of the chapters 211-12, 307 and 308 that the views described in all of them are not the same as those of the official or standard Saṅkhya, that Pancaśikha&rsquo;s views as presented in chapters 211-212 soom to be different from those in chap. 308, particularly when chap. 308 emphasizes that jõāna-karma-samuccaya was the view of</p>

<p>Pañcaśikha, while the official Saṅkhya holds that jõāna alone leads to liberation. It should be noted that these chapters nowhere refer to a work of Pancasikha but show him to be a wandering ascetic holding certain views. The present writer believes that the author of these pagsages in the Sāntiparva had no work before him and only knew by hearsay and tradition that Pancaśikha was a great Saṅkhya teacher. Prof. Keith holds that the Pancasikha of the Santiparya is not identical with Pancaśikha, the author of Şastitantra (p. 48 of. Saṅkhya System&rsquo;), 2213</p>
<p>There are other chapters in the Santiparva where the peculiar Saṅkhya doctrines and terminology are employed but they are brought in line with Vasudeva or Highest Self to which the Saṅkhya doctrines are made subordinate. For example, in chap. 340 Narada is said to have been 2244 told by God himself some of the tenets of Saṅkhya such as the twenty-four tattvas and Puruṣa as the 25th tattva, the three guṇas, that Purusa is kṣetrajña and bhoktr, that ācāryas, who have arrived at definite conclusions about Sāṅkhya, call God who is in the orb of the Sun as Kapila, that Hiraṇyagarbha, who is well praised in the Veda and is announced as (author) of Yogaśāstra, is &lsquo;myself&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Not only in the Santiparva, but also in other parvans of the Mahābhārata, Sārkbya doctrines are dwelt upon. For example, the Aśvamedhika (in chap. 35. 47-48) speaks of sattva, rajas, tamas as ātmaguñas and mentions their equilibrium. In another place, the same parvan enumerates the 24 tattvas viz. avyakta, mahan, ahankāra &amp;c and describes the three guṇas. 2245</p>

<p>Asuri la mentioned by the S. Kāriki as the pupil of Kapila, also in a quotation in Yogasūtrabhāsya on 1. 25 ( note 2251) and by the Santiparva (chap. 306). But no work is attributed to him and hardly any quotation from him is cited by writers on Sāökbya (except a verse quoted as his by Haribhadra a late Jain writer). Kapila is a legendary figure. In Rgveda X.. 27. 16 Kapila 214 is mentioned as one among ten (Angirases) whom, though similar to them, they ( Angirasos) urge on for a sacrifice, Vide Hall&rsquo;s Preface to Sāṅkhya-pravacanabhāsya ( ed. 1856 ) pp. 14 ff for the confused legends about Kapila. Some references to Kapila in the Mahābhārata have already been noted. In Vanaparva (221. 26) Kapila is styled as the promulgator of Saṅkhya-yoga, as Paramarṣi and as an incarnation of Agni. In the Matsyapurāṇa 2217 it is stated that water should be offered to the seven Bons of Brahmā, viz. Sanaka, Sananda, Sanatana, Kapila, Āsuri, Volhu and Pascaśikba. The Vāmada-purapa (60.70) mentions Kapila (as knower of Saṅkhya), Vodhu, Asuri, Pancasikba ( ag &lsquo;yogayukta&rsquo;) and states that Sanat kumāra approached Brahmā for yoga lore.</p>
<p>In the Snāpagūtra of Kātyāyana (kandikā 3) attached to the Paraskaragphyasūtra the above seven are the only persons to whom tarpunu is offered among zṣis (vide II. of Dh. vol. II.</p>

<p>p. 693). In the Bhagavatapurana (I. 3. 10) Kapila is said to be the 5th avatāra of Viṣṇu, is called siddhesa ( the lord of siddhas) and the teacher of Asuri in Saṅkhya that had become decadent (by lapse of time). The Gitā also (X. 26 siddhānām Kapilo munik&rsquo;) montions Kapila as a muni and the most eminent among siddhas. The 8. Kārikā also refers to him as muni, The Kūrmapurāna (II, 7. 7) echoes the very words of the Gita (&lsquo;siddhānām Kapilo muniḥ&rsquo;).</p>
<p>In the ranéas in Bs. Up. I. 6. 3 and VI. 5. 2-3, in which succession lists of teachers and pupils differing from one another ocour, Asuri is said to be disciple of Bharadvāja in the first and the pupil of Yājñavalkya in the second. Each list contains at least 60 teachers from Brabmā downwards. In the first place, it is difficult to hold that these lists are authentic and there is no evidence to establish that the Asuri mentioned in both is the Bame as the pupil of Kapila.</p>
<p>Pancaśikha&rsquo;s is a great name in the Saṅkhya system. His systematic work on that system was called Saṣtitantra. The 8. Kārikā (70,72 ) refers to him as the author of the Śastitantra containing great details, illustrative tales and discussions of others&rsquo; views. It was called Sastitantra because it expounded sixty topics and it contained sixty thousand gathās, 2248 The Yogasūtrabhāsya (IV. 13 ) quotes a verse which is ascribed to Şaṣṭitantra by Vāoaspeti on Yogasūtrabhāsya IV. 13. The present writer cannot agree with Keith p. 69 that the reference to Şaṣṭitantra in S. Kārikā (verso 72) is not to a work but to a philosophy of sixty topics. The āryā 72 had &amp; Sanskrit commen tary which was translated into Chinese in 546 A, D, in which it was stated that the work contained six thousand gathās, 2349 but the Bhamati (by Vācaspati ) on V. S. II. 1.3 ascribes it to Vārsaganya. It may be a slip on the part of Vacaspati or it is possible that he regarded Panouśikha and Vārṣagapy&amp; as the names of the same person, the first being a nickname and the latter a gotra name.

<p>History of Dharmaśāstra (Soc. VIII, Ch. XXXI</p>
<p>18,20, III. 13 and 41, IV.13 ( tatha ca sastrānusasanam Gupanam &amp;o), prose passages occur which Vacaspati ascribes to Panca sikha. On 8. Kārikā 2 Vācaspati quotes in his com, the view of Pancaśikhācārya. In Yogasūtrabhāsya on I. 25 &amp; būtra is quoted which Vācaspati ascribes to Pancasikha in which Kapila is styled &lsquo;adividvan&rsquo; (the first master of Saṅkhya) and</p>
<p>paramarṣi' and is said to have imparted to Asuri the Tantra, the Saṅkhya Siddhānta.</p>
<p>In the dialogue between Viśvārasu Gandharva and Yājāa valkya (in Santiparva, chap. 306) there is a long list of sages from whom Viśvāvasu says he learnt a great deal (in verses 56-60) but prays to Yajñavalkya 2250 that the latter should expound to bim the knowledge of Saṅkhya and Yoga (versos 65-66). Then Yajnavalkya states that prakrti is also called pradhāna, that it does not know the 25th (viz. the puruṣa) and that there is a 26th (Highest Self ) and so on. That list contains the following names: Jaigiṣavya, 2251 Asita, Devala, Vārṣaganya of the Parasaragotra, bhiksu Paricasikha, Kapila, Suka,Gautama, Arstisena, Gargya, Narada, Asuri, Pulastya, Sanatkumara, Sukra, father of Kasyapa. The sages are not mentioned in chronological order. Five of them (that are in Italics) are important so far as Saṅkhya and Yoga are concerned. We saw above that Pancasikha is said to be of Parāśara gotra and in the above list Vārṣaganya also is said to be of the same gotra. Vacaspati on S. Karika 47 ascribes to Varsagapya the view that Qvidyā has five facets or aspects. 2252 The Yogasūtrabhāsya on III. 53 quotes a sūtra of Vārṣagapya. It is shown above from</p>

<p>Panicaśikha and Varsganya :</p>
<p>1375</p>
<p>the reconstruction of the Sanskrit Com. from Chinese that Vārsagana was one of the teachers after Pancabikha and before Isvarakrona. So it is extremely doubtful if Pancaśikha and Vārṣaganya are identical, Vide JRAS for 1905 pp. 33-53 (by Takakusu who shows on p. 47 that Vrṣagana was a teacher of Vindhyavāsa and that Vasubandhu wrote &amp; work called Paramārthaaaptati in opposition to Vindhyayāsa and that Paramartha was in China from 546 to 569 A. D.</p>
<p>In the Introduction to the Uttarādhyayana-sūtra (a Jain work) Charpentier refers to two different lists one older and shorter which speaks of the four Vedas, Itihāsas (as 5th), Nighantu as the sixth and of the Vedic angas and upāngas and then of Şastitantra. This last may be a reference to Paños dikha&rsquo;s work or simply to the 60 topics dwelt upon in the Saṅkhya system,</p>
<p>In Santiparva (chap. 222) Yudhisthira asks Bhīṣma: by what character, conduct, lores and by being intent on what does &amp; person reach the abode of Brahmā which is higher (or beyond) prakpli and Bhiṣma mentions the dialogue of Jaigiṣavya and Asita Devala in which it is stated that he who is unperturbed by being reviled or praised, who keeps silent over his good deeds, does not harm oven him who harms him, is always oalm and doos good to all beings, reaches the abode of Brahma. The Buddhacarita (XII, 67) speaks of Jaiglṣavya, Janaka and Vļddha-Parāśara as having secured mokṣa by the path described in that chapter. The Yogabhāṣya (on III, 18) gives a long atory about Āvatya (called prince of Yogins) and JaigIsavya. Jaigiṣavya is quoted in Vyasabhāsya on Y. S. II. 55 for indriya jaya ( control over senses). He appears to be a Vedāntic writer on Yoga</p>
<p>Not only does the śāntiparya dilate upon some of the peculiar doctrines associated with the later official doctrines of the S. Karikā, but the Bhagavadgita also does 80. A few strik ing passages are cited here. Gitā XII.5 (Mahabhūtānyaha ökāro buddhiravyaktam eva 08 Indriyāṇi dasaikam ca pañoa condriyagocarāḥ&rdquo;) enumerates the twenty-four tattvas omitte ing puruṣa and mentioning the five elements in place of the five tanmātrās); XII. 19-20 ( prakçtim puruṣam caiva viddhya nādi ubhāvapi! vikārāmsca gupārsoaive viddhi prakrti sambhayān # Karyakāraña-kartstve hetuḥ prakrtir-uoyate ?

<p>(bhômirāposnalo vāyuḥ kham mano buddhireva ca i ahankara itiyam me bhinnā prakstir-aṣtadha :), VII. I3, II. 28. The Gita in VII, 6 and 8 emphatically states that God is the source of the whole world, which ultimately is merged in Him. Herein the Gitā differs materially from the standard Saṅkhya. The Gita expressly mentions “Saṅkhya-krtānta&rdquo; 2253 (i. e. siddhanta) in XVIII, 13; what that means is that by that time Sāṅkhya toneta had assumed the form of a system but there is no express or definite reference to a work such as in the case of Veda or Vedānta (in XV, 15) or Brahmasūtra (in XIII. 4).</p>
<p>Vindhyavāsa or Vindhyavāsin ( dweller on Vindhya moun. tain ) is identified with Isvarakļspa by Takakusu in B. E. F. E. O. for 1904 p. 48 and by Keith on pp. 73–79 in Saṅkhya System.&rsquo; His view about the non-existence of the ūlivāhika body after a man&rsquo;s death is mentioned by Kumārila 2254 Dr. B. Bhattacharya (in J. L H. vol. VI. pp. 36-49) goes into the question of the identity of Vindhyayāga with Isyarakrsna. The prosent writer agrees with him but he does not agree with big Aurther conclusion (p. 49 ) that Vindhyavāda lived earlier than Isvarakroṇa whom he assigns to the period 330-390 A. D. The evidence is too meagre to prove this. In JRAS for 1905 pp. 47 ff. Vindhyavāsa is said by Takakusu to be a pupil of Vrsagaña and that according to Paramartha Vṛṣagana and Vindhyavāsa lived in the 10th century after Buddha&rsquo;s nirvāṇa. From Kamalar ślla (p. 2% of Tattva-sangraha) it appears that Rudrila was also a name of Vindhyavāsa.</p>

<p>martanda 2256 on Yogasutra IV. 22(23 of most editions)&rsquo; drsti drøyoparaktam cittam sarvārtham&rsquo; quotes a prose passage from Vindhyavāsin. As there is no evidence to show that Iśvarakrspa composed some work other than the Saṅkhyakārikā, Vindhya vāsin must be treated as different from Isvarakļṣṇa according to Bhojadeva. The Yuktidspikā several times mentions the views of Vindhyavāsin and indicates that he is different from the author of the S. Kārikā. Vide pp. 4, 108, 144, 148. This work says that the acarya (author of S. Karika) did not enum erate jijñāsā 2257 and other constituents of the Sāstra but other ācāryas like Vindhyavāsa did mention them in other treatises. On pp. 144-145 this com, shows that Vindhyavāsin held that indriyas were vibhu (all-pervading), denied the existence of a subtle body (suksma sarira), while in S. Karika (40-41) Isvarakļṣpa held that the indriyas were not vibhu and that there was a linga or sūkṣma body and Yuktidipikā p. 144 says that Patañjali postulated &amp; subtle body.</p>
<p>How the name Sāñkhya came to be applied to a system of philosophy has to be considered. &lsquo;Saṅkhya&rsquo; means &lsquo;number&rsquo;, bence enumeration. As the Saṅkhya system enumerated twenty-five tattvas and as the Sastitantra of Pañcaśikha dealt with sixty topics, it is likely that the philosophy came to be called Saṅkhya. The sv. Up. I 4 is full of numbers. 2258 Verse I.5 of Sr. Up. employs the word parāca (five) seven times and also has the word &lsquo;paricasadbhedam&rsquo;, similar to satardharam&rsquo; in I.4); vide VI.3 also.

<p>History of Dharmatastra (Sec. VIII, Ch. XXXI</p>
<p>philosophic system which postulates twentyfive tattvas, Prakrti, Puruṣa and others. This is the sense in which the word is used once even in the Gitā (18. 13, Sāṅkhya krtante proktāni &amp;o). The Matsyapurāna also emphasizes this aspect of the Bankhya system.</p>
<p>The word &ldquo;Saṅkhyā&rsquo; has another sense as the Amarakosa states (carca sankhyā vicāraṇā ) viz. &lsquo;rational examination or</p>
<p>discernment&rsquo;; and the word Saṅkhya may be derived from it in the sense of &lsquo;system of rational examination&rsquo; and in the sense of &lsquo;philosopher&rsquo; (masculine) according to &lsquo;tadadhite tadveda&rsquo; (Pāṇ. IV. 2. 59 ) meaning &lsquo;Saṅkhyam peda&rsquo;. :59 The Bhimati explains the word in the second senso. Sāṅkhya in a general sense means tattvajñāna (knowledge of ultimate reality, includ ing Vedānta) or a &lsquo;person who knows the ultimate reality. The word Saṅkhya is frequently used in the Bhagavadgita in the sense of tattrajñānu ( as in II. 39, V.5, XIII. 24) and in the sense of a person knowing ultimate reality (in III. 3, V.5).</p>
<p>Some comparatively early Sanskrit works that disclose tonets similar to the standard Sāṅkhya of the Karikā may be briefly noticed here. The Buddhacarita of Aśvaghosa (in chap. XIII.17ff) mentions a dialogue between Arāda and Gautama (the future Buddha) in which occur prakrii, five elements, ahankūra, buddhi, the indriyas, objects of sense, mind, kṣetrajña as Atman and states that Kapila with his pupil wag enlightened as to these ; that nescience, actions and desires are the causes of samsāra ; that avidyā has five aspects (verses 33–37) which are defined, speaks of brahmacarya, and multi. Though the tattvas are mentioned here the rest of the doctrines bear very little resemblance to the official Saṅkhya.</p>
<p>The Carakasamhitā 2:60 (Jamnagar ed. 1949), Sārirasthāng chap. I (particularly versos 17, 36, 63-66) contains some doctrines similar to the Sāokhyakārikā scheme and verse 151</p>

<p>refers to Yogins and Sāökhyas and ultimately the liberated soul is said to become brahma. Therefore, it is more like the philo sophy of Katha and øv. Upaniṣads.</p>
<p>The Susrutasarihita also (in Sarirasthana, chap. I para graphs 3, 4-6, 8-9 ) sets out the Saṅkhya, 2261 is much closef to the standard system of the Karikā than either the Buddha carita or the Carakasamhitā as the quotations in the notes will show.</p>
<p>From p. 1352 and note 2208 above it would be seen that the tenet of pradhana being the cause of the world was mentioned in their works by Manu and others. This will be briefly illustrated. Manu I. 15 in speaking of creation mentions mabān, the three gunas, objects of sense, five senses. Manular refers to the five tanmātrās of the five elementa. In. Manusmrti XII. 24 sattva, rojas and tamas occur as the three gunas, verses 26-29 define and illustrate these three and XII. 30-38 dilate upon the different effects of the three guṇas and the indications about these guras; XII. 40 provides that those who rest in sattva-guna become gods, those who are rājasa become men and those that abide in tamas become lower animals. 262 Manu XIL 50 speaks of mahan and avyakta. Yaj. smrti (III. 91-92) speaks of the five objects of sense, five jnanendriyas, five karmendriyas and mind (16 inall); these sixteen together with abankāra, buddhi and five elements, kṣetrajña and Isvara are mentioned in Yāj. III, 177-178 and verses 179-180 sot out the evolution of buddhi from avyakta, of ahankāra from buddhi, of tapmātrās from abankāra, the five gunas (sabda, sparsa &amp;c.) of the five elements and verse 182 speaks of the three guṇas.</p>

<p>On p. 1352 and in note 2208 above occurs the statement of Saṅkarācārya that Davala, &amp; Sūtrakāra on Dharma, accepted Sāṅkbya doctrines. This will be briefly indicated here. Apararka on Yaj. III. 109 quotes a very long passage 2263 froml Devala, which after stating that there are two goals of human life (purusārtha) viz. abhyudda&rsquo;, a and niḥśreyasa and that the latter comprises Sāokhya and Yoga, defines Saṅkhya as the knowledge of twenty-five tattvas, and yoga as the fixing of the mind on the desired goal after turning it away from objects of sense, and</p>

On the same page three versos and a hall are quoted from Brabpāṇdapurāṇa for the tbree band has (Brahmandapurana, Vonk. Edition IV.3.37-40).</p>

<p>states that the fruit of both is apavarga which means the total disappearance of the sufferings of birth and death. The quotation then proceeds to say that there are extensive and profound tantras concerning both Saṅkhya and Yoga composed by former (sages) relying on ratiocination and tradition and these will be summarized and their subjects set out. As to the Saṅkhyas there are these : mūlapraksti, seven categories that are both prakrtis and vikstis, five tapmātrās, sixteen vikāras (products); indriyas are five (jñanedriyas) and five (karmendriyas), five objects of sense, five elements; thirteen karunas, three being aptahkaranas; viparyaya of five kinds, aśakli of 28 kinds ; tuṣti of nine kinds, siddhis of eight kinds; in this way there are 50 pratyayabbodas, there are ton basic matters, viz. astitva (existence of praksti &amp;c). After this there is again an enumera tion of praksti, avyakta, mahān, ahankāra, five tapmātrās &amp;c.</p>
<p>It would be noticed that the quotation from Dovala in Aparārka contains two parts, the first stopping at the words&rsquo;iti dasa mūlikārthāļ&rsquo; and the 2nd containing the rest. It appears that the two parts cover mostly the same ground and it is probable that the two parts are summaries of two different works on Saṅkhya /</p>
<p>| Another important digest of the first quarter of the 12th century A, D, namely the Kṛtyakalpataru of Lakṣmidhara in its Moksakānda pp. 100-101 also quotes from Davala&rsquo;s Dharmagātra a prose passage which agrees word for word with a portion of the passage quoted above from Aparārka viz. from the words * tatra sankhyānām ekā mūlaprakstiḥ' up to trinyantaḥ karapāni'. Then the portion from &lsquo;catasras-catasro&rsquo; to &lsquo;iti daśa mūlikārthāh&rsquo; is dropped by the Kalpataru and then it has the whole of the passage from &lsquo;atha mūlaprakftiravyaktam&rsquo; up to &lsquo;abbimāpa ityanarthāntaram, 2264 after which it adds a short passage not found in Aparārka (which is quoted below).

<p>the note below. It will be noticed that after enumerating the twenty-five tattvas Yama adds Purusottama as the 26th tattva.ants</p>
<p>Purāpas contain lengthy disquisitions on the Saṅkhya doctrines. For example, the Visnupurana I. 2. 19-23, 25-62, VI.4.13.15, 17,32-40 (in all about 66 verses) are full of Saṅkhya doctrines and are all.quoted in the Kștyakalpataru (Mokṣakāṇda pp. 102-108). But that Purana emphasizes that Paramatman (called Vispu) is the support of all tattvas. In Visnupurana I. 2. 22-23 it is asserted 2766 that brahmavadins who are proficient in Vedic doctrines recite (a verse) that expounds pradhana, (and state) &lsquo;there was then (before creation) neither day nor night, no sky nor earth, neither darkness nor light, there was only one male brahma that was evolved as pradbāna and that could not be apprehended by the ear (and other indriyas) or by buddhi. Verses 39-40 (of Visnupurana VI. 4) assert that both 2267 praksti and puruṣa become dissolved in the Highest Self who is called Visnu in Vedas and Vedantas ( Upanisads).</p>
<p>Many other Purānas deyote a great deal of space to the elucidation of Saṅkhya doctrines and terminology. Considerar tions of space preclude any statement beyond references to</p>

<p>ohapters and verses of some Purāṇas and the oitation of a fow striking or informative verses. Matsya (3. 14-29) begins with praksti, gunas and all the twenty-five tattvas, remarks that the three gods, Brahma, Visnu, Mahesvara, though one, arose from the guṇas being put into activity and winds up by saying that Saṅkhya is full of enumerations and was proclaimed by Kapila and others.n68 The Brahmapurana (1. 33-35, 33. 3-4,242, 67-70, 76-85) recounts the tattvas from prakrti to ksetrajfia and remarks at the end that the soul becomes kevala (free from</p>
<p>all contacts and liberated) when he realizes the truth about himself. The Padmapurāṇa in several places dilates upon the tattvas of the Saṅkhya such as in Patalakhanda 85, 11-18, Srstikhanda, chap. 2. 88-103, chap. 15. 177-187, which closely follow the 8. Kārikā verses. The Kūrmapurāṇa (I. 4. 13–35) states that Maheśvara enters prakrti and puruṣa, activates them and sets out Sāṅkhya ideas and in II. 7. 21-26 it refers to the twenty-four tattvas and the state of equilibrium (sāmyavasthā). The Markandeya.purana in chap. 42. 32-62 treats of creation with Saṅkhya terminology. Three verses of the Brahmanda IV. 3. 37-46 referring to the threefold bondage (bandha) are quoted by the Krtyakalpataru (moksa) p. 124. Similarly, Brahmanda (II. 32.71-76) employ the Saṅkhya terminology of mahat,ahaikara &amp;o. Prof. Das Gupta in &lsquo;Indian Philosophy&rsquo; vol. IV. pp. 24-48 deals at some longth with Kapila&rsquo;s philosophy in the Bhāgavatapurāna and Sri Siddhesvara Bhattacharya contributes a paper &lsquo;a critique of the Bhagavata&rsquo; in JBRS for. 1950 pp. 9–50 in which he severely criticizes Prof. Das Gupta.</p>

<p>History of Dharmaśāstra [ Soc. VIII, Ch. XXXI</p>
<p>Vide Bhagavatapurāṇa IV. 26. The Varābapurāṇa (B. I. ed. of 1893) narrates the story of king Aśvaśiras to whom Kapila and Jaigiṣavya ( the prince of Yogins) came after he had performed the avabhrtha bath and was surrounded by brāhmaṇas and who asked them how the highest Nārāyana was to be worshipped, when the two told him that they were themselves Nārāyana. On his doubting these words of theirs Kapila assumed the form of Vispu and Jaigisavya of Garuda and after other similar wonders, the king requested that his doubt whether Moksa is attained by him who follows karmamārga or jñānamarga be resolved. The same Purāṇa in chap. 25 (verses 1-5) declares that aryakta, the first tattva, made up of three (gunas) arose from the highest Puruṣa, from the union of the two ahankāra was produced also called mahat, that Puruṣa is named Viśṇu or Siva while avyakta is called Umā, Devi or Sri and Guha (Kārtikeya) is abankāra. The Bhagavatapurāṇa (I. 3. 10) mentions Kapila as the fifth avatāra of Visou (vide above p. 1373) and (in X. 8. 37-38) states that when Yaśodā asked the child Krspa to open his mouth she saw inside the inouth the whole world, the five elements, the indriyas, mind, mātrās and the three gupas. Even great poets like Kālidāsa and Bāṇa are fond of utilising Sāṅkhya doctrines and terminology. For example, vide Kumārasambhava II. 4 (Gunatrayavibhāgāya &amp;c.), Raghu vamsa X. 38 (angidām tamagovobhau gunau prathamamadhya mau), Raghuvamsa VIII. 21 (Raghurapyajayad-guna-trayam prakstistham &amp;c.); Kādambari, very first verse (rajojuse janmani&hellip;triguṇātmane Damaḥ).</p>
<p>Even the Tantras were influenced by the Saṅkhya system as the Sāradātilaka shows ( vide above p. 1061),</p>
<p>It is not a vain boast when the Santiparva 3 269 asserts that whatever knowledge is found in the Vedas, in Sāṅkhya and Yoga, in the various Purāṇas, in the extensive itibāsas, in the arthaśāstra and whatever knowledge exists in the world, all that is derived from the Saṅkhya. For a dispassionate appraisal of the Saṅkhya theory of evolution and its stages, vide Dr. Bebanan&rsquo;s work on. Yoga &lsquo;chap. IV. pp. 63-91.</p>

<p>Yoga and Dharmaśāstra</p>
<p>Saṅkhya and Yoga often go together in the Upaniṣads 28 well as in the Mahābhārata, the Bhagavadgitā and the Purānas and their relationship to one another is the same in all these. In Sv. Up. VI. 13, Vanaparva 2.15, śāntiparva 2270 228, 28, 289.1, 306. 65, 308, 25, 326. 100, 336. 69, Anuśāsana 14, 323, Bhagavad gitā V. 4-5, Padma purāpa (Pātālakbanda, 85. 11 ff), the two are mentioned together,</p>
<p>Though Saṅkhya greatly influenced all works dealing with the evolution of the world in its various aspecte, it did not enjoy that great esteem among all sorts of people in India that the Yoga system enjoyed and still enjoys. The word yoga is derived from the root &lsquo;yuj&rsquo; to join or to unite (of rudhādi class). The germs of yoga can be traced back to the Rgveda. Rgveda V. 81. 1 ( a verse in praise of Savitp ) reads &lsquo;wise men, priests and sacrificers concentrate their minds and join their prayers to the wise, the great (Savitr), who knows all (prayers). Another Vedic -271 verse also speaks of concentrating the mind. The word &lsquo;yoga&rsquo; occurs frequently in the Rgveda in several shades of meaning. Sāyana in many passages takes yoga&rsquo; to mean acquiring what is not already possessed&rsquo; (as in Rg. I. 5. 3). In Rg, I. 18.7 God Sadasaspati (Agni) is said to pervade the prayers (or thoughts) of sacrificers. In Rg. I. 34. 9 it means &lsquo;yoking&rsquo; (kada yogo vājino rāsabhagya yena yajñam Bāsatyo payāthaḥ&rsquo;. The word &lsquo;yoga&rsquo; is often used with the word kṣema (separately as in Rg. VII. 54. 3, VII. 86. 8) or as a compound</p>

<p>History of Dharmaśāstra ( Seo. VIII, Ch. XXXD</p>
<p>(as in Rg. X. 166. 5 Yogakṣemam va adayaham bbūyāsam uttamal&rsquo;). There is a great distance or gap between the meaning of the word yoga in the Rgveda (even in the verses about concentrating the mind) and its meaning in some of the Upaniṣads and in classical Sanskrit. In Rg. X. 136. 2-3 thero is mention 3272 of munis, eons of Vātarajada, who wore dirty and tawny garments and who say in verse 3 &lsquo;we being in oostasy (or wild bliss) owing to cur way of life as munis resort to winds; mortals! you look on our bodies only&rsquo;. This shows that even in those ancient times, some people practised tapas, did not care what clothes they wore and thought they (i.e. their souls) would be merged in the wind (that is, the souls are formless and could not be seen). In Rg. VIII. 17. 14 Indra is said to be a friend of munis and muni is also a friend of every god in Rg. X. 136. 4. But as to yatis the position was rather different. The word yali occurs several times in the Rgveda but in most cases that word has no certain connection with the meaning of &lsquo;ascetio&rsquo;. In Rg. VIII. 3. 9 &lsquo;by which (says brabma priest ) wealth was given to Börgu from the yatis and by which you helped (or protected) Praskanva&rsquo;; here Indra sooms to be opposed to yatis. In Rg. VIII, 6. 18 the poet says &lsquo;O valiant Indra! listen to my prayer alone from among the yatis and Bhṛgus that praised thee Here Sāyaṇa explains &lsquo;yatayaḥ&rsquo; as Angirasah&rsquo;. In any case &lsquo;yatis&rsquo; are here shown to be devotees of Indra. But in other Sarbitas it is said that Indra threw &lsquo;yatis&rsquo; to the wolves or hyenas, 1773 Later on, however, the meaning of yati seems to have changed. In those Samhitā passages &lsquo;yatis&rsquo; appear to be persons hostile or alien to the Vedic rites, but what they did to deserve</p>

<p>slaughter by Indra is not clear. In Atharvaveda II. 5. 3 Indra is said to have killed Vṭtra as he did in the case of yatis. Some of the Upaniṣads, however, show that &lsquo;yati&rsquo; was a person who had given up worldly affairs, practised yoga and endeavoured after the knowledge of Atman and realized Brahma; vide Mundaka Up. III, 1, 5 (yama paśyanti yatayah kṣinadosāh) and III. 2. 6 (sannyāsayogād-yatayaḥ śuddhasattvaļ). Some like Haier in * Die Anfrange der Yoga-praxis&rsquo;, 1922 pp. 11 ff) hold that the Vrātyas of Atharvavada XV were eostation of the kṣatriya class and forerunners of Yogins.</p>
<p>The word &lsquo;yoga&rsquo;occurs in some of the Upaniṣads in the same sense in which it is employed in the Yogasūtra. In Katha Up. II. 1%, it is said 2274 the wise man reflecting on God by means of yoga, by concentrating the mind on the inner spirit becomes free from joy and grief&rsquo; (adhyātmayogadhigamona ). The same Upaniṣad says that the state described in VI. 11 is regarded as Yoga because therein the organs (and the mind and buddhi) are firmly held under control. Ia Katha Up. VL 18 it is said that Naciketas having understood the vidyā and the whole procedure of Yoga propounded by Yama attained (the realization of) brahma. The word &lsquo;Yoga&rsquo; occurs in the Tai. Up. II. 4 (in speaking about vijñanamaya atman, yoga is said to be its ātman, the exact sense being doubtful), and in the Sv. Up. II. 11 and VI. 13, Praśna (5.5-6) speaks of the three mātrās (a, u,m) of Om. In Sv. Up. 1. 3 Occurs the word &lsquo;dhyānayoga&rsquo;. The Sv. Up. (II. 8–13) refers to āsana and prāpāyāma and sets out the first signs of the successful practics of Yoga. The Chan, Up. VIII, 15 appears to refer to pratyāhāra (though the technical word is not used ) in &lsquo;atmani sarvendri. yāṇi pratiṣthāpya&rsquo;(having brought all organs of sense to rest in the atman).&rsquo; The Bļ. Up. (1.5.23) appears to refer to prāṇāyama in he should observe the one vow, viz. inhalation and exhala tion (tasmad-ekameva vratam carot prāṇyao-oaiva apanyacca).</p>

<p>History of Dharmatūsıra 1 Soc. VIII, Ch. Xxxii</p>
<p>The Vedantagūtra (II. 1. 3 &lsquo;etena yogaḥ pratyuktah) states that Yoga is refuted by the reasoning adopted for the refutation of the Sāṅkhya system. The position of Saskarāoārga as to both Sāokhya and Yoga has been stated above (pp. 1352 and 1361 n. 2208 and 2221). He points out in the pūrvapaksa that Voda 2375 proscribes Yoga as a means of achieving correct knowledge and refers to Bṛ, Up. II, 4. 5. He further points out that in the Sv. Up. Yoga is expounded in great detail after first mentioning the proper posture (for the practice of Yoga) in the words &lsquo;having held the body straigbt but raised high in three places viz. chest, neck and head&rsquo; (Sv. Up. II, 8). From the words of Saṅkarācārya that in Yogaśāstra also Yoga is held to be a means of the realisation of right knowledge, it follows that be had a yogaśāstra before him in which occurred the words &lsquo;atha&hellip; yogah,&rsquo; but as he does not einploy the word Yogasūtra he probably does not refer to a sūtra work. If a conjecture may be hazarded, it is possible that the Yogaśāstra meant by Saṅkara is a work like the Yogaśāstra ascribed to Yājñavalkya in Yāj. Smrti III. 110 (Yogaśāstram ca mat-proktam &amp;c.). Saṅkaracārya admits on V. S. ]], 1, 3 that a part of the yoga is acceptable to him but other parts conflict with the Veda. Mundaka Up. (II 2.6) enjoins samūdhi in the words &lsquo;om-iti dhyāyatha ātmānam&rsquo; as Saṅkarācārya states on V. S. II, 3. 39 (samadhyabhāvāc-ca). In the Upanisada &lsquo;Muni&rsquo; and &lsquo;Yati&rsquo; have come to denote 2276 the same meaning, o g. Bṛ. Up. IV. 4. 22 states one becomes muni by realizing this very self,&rsquo;</p>

<p>while the Mundaka (III. 1. 5) 2777 states this self is to be attained by Truth, by tapas, by right knowledge and by sexual purity at all times: that self resides inside the body (like a light), is pure, whom spotless ascetics realize.&rsquo; The Kathopaniṣad (III. 13), provides that the wise man should restrain speech in mind ( speech and mind, as the text stands), he should keep it within the self which is knowledge, he should keep down knowledge within the self that is, the great, and he, should keep that (the great) within the self which is quiet. The Upaniṣada thus not only employ the word &lsquo;Yoga&rsquo; but provide some of the stages of yoga and its technique for realiz ing the Supreme Spirit. About twenty Yoga Upaniṣads are published at Adyar, edited by A. Mahadev Sastri (1920), but as their chronology is most uncertain and as most of them appear to the present writer to be later than the Mahābhārata, Manu and probably the Yogasūtra, they are passed over here and are referred to in this work sparingly.2278</p>
<p>Pānini provides for the formation of the words yama and niyama (two angas) of Yoga and the word &lsquo;Yogin&rsquo; appears to have been derived by him from the root &lsquo;yuj&rsquo; with the affix &lsquo;ghinun&rsquo;(i. e. in) in the sense of tūcchīlya (being babituated to) according to Pān. III. 2. 142 ( which is a very long gūtra ).2279</p>

<p>That the yoga Upaniṣads are late productions may be briefly indicated here. Verses 10–14 of the trea (dealing with the adhāra and svadhisthāna cakras) are found in the race (verses, 43-47) and la the grap ( verses 4-9 ) with slight variations. Vide pp. 1060-1062 aod notes 1715-1717 above for the six chakras and the pādis. In the description of prāṇāyāma the sandilya Upanisad quotes certain verses with the words तदेते श्लोका भवन्ति, some of which occur in the गोरक्षशतक. One cannot say definitely that the sandilya borrows from G. S., but this is possible. All the ancient and medieval works on the several branches of yoga are not yet available, and therefore one cannot preclude the possibilsty that sāndilya and other yoga upanigads and three borrow from earlier sources not yet discovered.</p>

<p>History of Dharmasāstra i seo. VIII, Ch. XXXII</p>
<p>The Āpastambadharmastitra (1. 8. 23. 3-6) quotes a verse &ldquo;The total destruction of dosas (taints ) is due to Yoga in this life ; a wise man after having expelled all dosas that cause barm to all beings reaches peace (mokṣa)&rsquo; and then it sota out fifteen dosas such as anger, ecstatic joy, greed, bypooriny, the destruc tion of which is due to Yoga and enumerates the qualities that are opposites of the dosas. This shows that long before the 4th or 5th century B. C. Yoga as a discipline of the mind had been well developed.</p>
<p>The V.S. II. 1.3 indicates that the Sūtrakāra had before him a body of Yoga doctrines, some of which wore the same as those of the Saṅkhya and he also knew Samadhi (V. 9. II. 3, 39 ). Again, the V.8. mentions ( in IV.2.21) Yoging and distinguishes Saṅkhya and Yoga as smārta ( and not srauta). Saskarācārya on V. S. I. 3. 33 quotes the extant Yogasūtra II. 44 (syadhyāyad. iṣta-devata-samprayogah) and on 2280 V. S. II, 4, 12 he appears to be willing to admit that the Yoga-sîtra preceded V. S. and quotes Yogasūtra 1. 6 in the 2nd interpretation of that sūtra.</p>
<p>The important question is whether the author of the V. S. refers to the extant Yogasutra. The present author holds for various reasons that the V. 8. does not refer to the prosent Yoga sūtra, but to the Yoga doctrines that had been developed even before the Katha Mundaka, Svetāśvatara and other Upaniṣads.</p>

<p>Ancient propounders of Saṅkhya-yoga</p>
<p>1391</p>
<p>was the ancient knower of Yoga, no one else (know it); Apāntaratamas Was Vedācārya whom some called the sage Prāoinagarbbe. In the previous chapter it is stated that Saṅkhya, Yoga, Vedaranyaka and Panoarātra are one and are angas of each other. In Santi. 326. 65 Hiranyagarbha is again connected with Yogasastra. Videp. 1371above. In the Anusasanaparvan2 Sanatkumāra appears to be connected with Yoga as the founder, just as Kapila was the founder of Saṅkhya. In the Ahirbudhnya Samhita (XII. 32-33) it is stated that Hiranyagarbha first propounded two Yogagamhitās, one was called &lsquo;Nirodhayoga&rsquo; and the other was called Karmayoga&rsquo;, the first of which was again divided twelve-fold. The Bhamati 2283 on V.S. II. 1.3 states that that sūtra does not totally negative the authoritativeness of the Yogaśāstra of Hiraṇyagarbha and Patañjali. The Viṣnu purāpa 2284 appears to quote two verses from Hiranyagarbha (vide note below). Vacaspati in his commentary on Yogasūtra I. 1 states that Yogi-Yājñavalkya mentions that Hiranyagarbha was the propounder of Yoga. Vāoaspati regards the Yogasūtra of Patanjali as later than Yoga-Yajñavalkya-smrti. There fore, it is almost certain that the v.S. refutes the doctrines of that Yoga system that was known to the Santiparva.</p>
<p>In Salyaparva (chap. 50) a story is told about bhiksu Jaiglsavya who was a great Yogin and of &lsquo;Asita Devala&rsquo;, a householder staying on the holy Sārasvata-tirtba. ___In the Santiparva (or. od. chap. 222 = Ch. ed. chap. 229 ) there is a long dialogue between Jaigiṣavya and Asita about Yoga, one verse (14) 2285 from which may be cited</p>

<p>History of Dharmatastra 180c, VIII, Ch. XXXII</p>
<p>here Yogins do not talk much by way of censure and praise of others and their minds are nevor affected by the praise and censure of them indulged in by others.&rsquo; In that chap. Jaigi. ṣavya is described as one who was never angry nor joyful. In the Varābapurāpa ( 4. 14 ) it is stated that Kapila and Yogirat Jaiglṣarya came to king Aśvasiras that had taken the avabhrtha hath after Aśvamedha and assumed the forms of Visnu and Garuda respectively. It may be noted that on Y. S. II. 55 the hhāsya quotes several views, but prefers that of Jaigigavya. On Y. 8. III, 18, 2286 the bhāṣya mentions the dialogue between Avatya and Jaigisa vya, where the latter&rsquo;s opinion is stated to be that from the point of view of hairulyn, the happiness of contentment is also misery, though as compared to pleasures of sense contentment is supposed to be and may be called happiness</p>
<p>In the Buddhacarita (XII) when Gautama (the future Buddha) approached a philosopher Arāda, the latter described to Gautama his idea of the path to moksa and mentioned Jaiglṣarya, Janaka and Vrddha. Parāśara as persons that had become liberated by following that path,2787</p>
<p>From these references it follows that Jaigisavya was a great teacher of Yoga long before the Christian era and probably bad composed a work on Yoga not now available.</p>
<p>There are numerous English translations of the Yogasutra (wholly or partly) and of the Bhāsya and Vacaspati&rsquo;s Com mentary, such as that by Dr. Rajendralal Mitra with text of Y, S., bhāsya and com.

<p>Many editions of the Yogasutra of Patañjali with the bhāsya of Vyāsa and the commentary (called Tattvavaisāradi) of Vācaspati have been printed in India. I shall mention only two or three editions of the text of the Sūtra and the two commentarios viz. the edition by the late Pandit Rajaram Shastri Bodas, printed in beautiful type at the Nirnayasagara Press in 1892 and the other, the Anandaśrama edition of 1932 which contains the sūtra, bhāsya, Vacaspati&rsquo;s commentary and also the commentary called Rājamārtanda of king Bhoja. In the Kashi Sanskrit series the Yogasūtra was printed (in 1930) with six commentaries viz. the Rājamārtaṇda of Bhojarāja, the Pradipikā of Bhāvā Ganesa, vitti by Nāgoji-bhatta, the Maṛi. prabbā by Rāmānandayati, the Candrika by Anantadeva and the Yoga-sudhākara by Sadāśivendra Sarasvati 2378</p>
<p>The Yogagūtra, as compared with the sūtras of some other darśanas, is a brief one. It is divided into four pādus, vix.</p>
<p>2288a. It should be noted that Bhojadeva omits Yogasūtra IV. 16 (me r a da AGHARTER aan Fan FENICE) which is commented upon in the Vyasabhāṣya and by Vācaspati. On the other hand, Yogasūtra III. 20 (na ca tat-sālambadam tasyāvlṣayībbūtatvāt) does not occur in the edition of Pandit Bodas Shastri and is not commented upon by Bhāvā Ganeta and Nāgoji. The form of the sūtra fo Y. S. IV. 16 makes one feel some doubt about its genuineacas, but as it is explained by the bhāṣya and Vāçaspati, one has to accept it as genuing,</p>

<p>Samadhi (concentration), Sadhana (means of attainment), Vibhūti (super-normal powers) and Kaivalya (aloofness, liberation). There are only 195 sūtras in all the pādas together (51+55+55+34).</p>
<p>Dr. Radhakrishnan in &lsquo;Indian Philosophy&rsquo; (vol II. of the ed. of 1931 pp. 341-42) holds that the author of the Yogasūtra is not later than 300 4. D. Prof. 8. N. Das Gupta in ‘History of Indian Philosophy' (vol. I. pp. 226–238) is in favour of the identity of the two Patañjalis and therefore holds that the author of the Yogasūtra flourished in the 2nd century B.O.2289 The Sanskrit paper of Pandit R. Ramamurtiśarmā in J. of Venkatesvara Institute of Tirupati (vol. II pp. 289-294) and Mr. Govind Das&rsquo;s brief note in I. A. vol. 44 (for 1915 p. 24) may also be read in this connection. Jacobi and (following him) Keith hold that the Yogasūtra (I. 40), meaning at the most the mastery of the Yogin extends from the minutost particle to the greatest magnitude imaginable', 2290 refers to the atomic theory of the world. This is a good sample of the way in which even great Western writers road in simple words later theories and try to give late dates to early works. The Upaniṣads speak of the self as more minute then what is anu and as greater than the great and the Mahābhārata also uses the same phraseology, There is no convincing reason to suppose that the Yogasutra refers only to a theory of atoms propounded in the Vaibeṣika system and is not paraphrasing the words of the Upaniṣad and the Mahābhārata.</p>
<p>We have also to consider the early tradition embodied in an introductory verse in Bhojadeva&rsquo;s commentary (not later than 1055 A, D.) and mentioned by Cakrapāpi (commentator</p>

The present author doas not agree with Dr. Sircar and holds that the arguments for placing the Mahābbāṣya in the 2nd century B. C. are far more weighty than those put forward by Dr. Sircar.</li>

<p>1396 History of Dharmalandra (Soc. VIII, Oh Xxx of the Carakasanhita 3291 (about 1060 A. D.) that Patakjall (doomed to be an avatūra of Saṣa ) composed works on Grammar, Yoga and Medicine.</p>
<p>The present author cannot deal at length in this volume with the two questions of identity and of the dates of the two works, as be is mainly concerned with the influence of Yoga on Dharmaśāstra works. He thinks that hardly any cogent argi. monts have been advanced to positively disprove the identity of the authors of the Mahabhāsya and of the Yogasutra. Whether the revision of Caraka&rsquo;s work was done by the same Patañjali is very doubtful. In the Sāntiparva the founder of Cikitsita (medicine ) is said to have been Kṭspātreya and not Caraka nor Patañjali. The Caraka-sambitā uses the expression &lsquo;iti ha smāba bhagavān.Atreya)&rsquo; in the beginning of its chapters. Caraka (in I. 1. 23 ff) states that the sage Bharad āja learnt Āyurveda from Indra His pupil was Punarvagu Atreya, who had six disciples viz. Agniveśa, Bheda, Jatākarpa, Parasara, Harita and Kṣarapāni. First, Agnivesa composed a treatine on Ayurveda and read it to Xtrega and then Bheda and others did so. In the chapter called Tisraisapiya&rsquo; in Caraka-Bardhita (I. 11. 75) Krspātreya&rsquo;s view is specially mentioned. Therefore, it appears that Kroṇātreya 2292 is different from Atreya who is rovergntly mentioned at the beginning of Caraka&rsquo;s chapters, Even the Buddhacarita of Aśvaghoṣa mentions Ātreya as the first propounder of medical scienco.</p>
<p>It is possible to argue that the tradition that Patañjali dealt with Yoga and Grammar is older than the Vakyapadiya of Bhartphari. That work states in its first section 22% (called Brahmakānda) that the taints that affect the body, speech and</p>

<p>Patanjali and Vākyapadiya</p>
<p>1397</p>
<p>intellect are purified (rospectively) by the sciences of medicine, grammar and metaphysics. Then in the eulogy of the Maha bhāṣya it remarks &lsquo;alabdhagadhe gāmbhīryād-uttana iva sausthavāt&rsquo;, on which the commentator explains that in the verse from the Brahmakāṇda the author of the Mahābhāsya is praised and in the other verse there is praise of the bhāsya itself. From this it appears to follow that according to the commentator the Vākyapadiya attributes the three śāstras on medicine, grammar and metaphysics (i, e. Yoga) to Patañjali himself.</p>
<p>Even if it be held that the authors of the Yogasūtra and of the Mahābhāsya are different persons, there are hardly any reasons for definitely assigning the author of the Yogasūtra to a date later than the 2nd or 3rd century A. D. The date of the Yogabhāsya of Vyāsa is of considerable importance in arriving at the probable date of the Yogasūtra. But the question of the date of the Yogabhāṣya is also debatable. The Vyasa who composed the Yogabbāsya would have to be held as different from Vedavyāsa, the reputed author of the Mahābhārata.</p>
<p>The author of the Yogasūtra is, according to the tradition embodied in such comparatively early commentaries as that of Vācaspatimisra, said to be Patanjali. Important questions arise as to his age and his identity with Patañjali, the author of the famous Mahabhāsya on Pāṇini&rsquo;a grammar and the Vārtikas thereon. The grammarian Patañjali is generally held to have flourished about 150 B. O. Therefore, the question of identity becomes important for the date of the Yogasutra. Some scholars like Prof. B. Liebich, Dr. Hauer (p. 98 of the work of 1932 ) and Prof. Das Gupta favour the identity of the two, but several others such as Jacobi, Keith, Wooda, Renou are against it. Prof. Ronou (in I. E. Q. Vol. XVI. pp. 586-591) examines the question from the grammatical point of vior, points out that certain words like Pratyāhāra, Upasarga, Pratyaya are used in the Yogasūtra in senses entirely different from the senses of these words in the Mahabhāsya. But as the subjects of the two works are entirely different, the same words may have acquired different senses. Similarly, Prof. Renou relies on breaches of grammatical rules (in the Yogagūtra I. 34), while he says that Patañjali in the Mahabhāṣya is very strict in following Pāpini&rsquo;s rules though Parini himself is rarely not striot in observing his own rules as in &ldquo;tat-prayojako hotusca! (I 4. 55) which is Against his own gūtra trjakābhyām kartari' (IL. 2. 15); but</p>
<p>1398</p>
<p>History of Dharmatastra (Bog. VIII, C. XXXI</p>
<p>Patanjali also employs such an expressions as &lsquo;aviravikanyāya 22 (which should be avyavikanyayena ) for which Patañjali ig oriticized in the long Pūryapaksa on Vyakarana contained in the Tantravārtika and which is not explained away in the reply to the Puryapakṣa. It cannot be supposed that the Yogasutra for the first time settled the technical terms of Yoga Yoga terms had been evolving from Upanisad times and Patanjali only used them in the sense which they had acquired in the course of centuries. Prof. Ronou arrives at the conclusion that the Yogasūtra is later by several conturies than the Mahabhāsys, Jacobi in his paper on the dates of the philosophical sūtras of the Brahmaṇas&rsquo; (in JAOS, vol. 31 pp. 1-29 ) holds (p. 29 ) that be Yogasutra must be later that the 5th century A. D. and, following Garbe, thinks that it is not improbable that the Vyasabhasya was composed in the 7th century AD. The views of Jacobi are strongly criticized by Jwala Prasad in J. R. A. 8. for 1930 pp. 365–375. The present author disagrees with Jacobi and Prof. Ronou.</p>
<p>The date of the Yogabbāṣya will have considerable bearing on the date of the Yogasūtra. The Yogabhāsya presupposes much literary activity on Yoga. It mentiona by name on Y. 8. II, 55 and on III. 18 Jaiglṣavya who is a prominent figure in the Mahābhārata as shown above ( pp. 1367 and 1374). Vide also the story of Asita Dovala with whom Jaiglṣavya atayed for many years as a bbiksu and adept in Yoga ( Salyaparva, chap. 50). It has to be remembered that several interpretations of the same Yogasutra are noted in the bhāṣya ( ag on II. 55). The Yogabhāṣya quotes several Kūrikūs and versos dealing with the matters treated of in the Y. 8. as on Y. S. I. 28, 48, II. 5, 28 (on nine causes that lead to Vivekakbyati ). II, 32, III, 6, JII, 15 (OD seven Cittadharmas of the apariltsta type ). Besides these, several quotations in proso are cited in the bhāṣya, many of which are attributed to Pancaśikha by Vācaspati (vide pp. 1373–74 above), and some ( as on II, 22, 30, 52) to āgamins (those who know the tradition or Voda). Therefore, it follows that some centuries intervene between the Yogasūtra and its bhāgya.</p>
<p>The Bhagya on Y. 8. II. 42 quotes a verse with the words * tatha coktam' ( it has also been said ), which is identical with</p>

<p>a verge from the Santiparva. 2295 It is most unlikely that an author will rely on his own work for supporting a proposition propounded in another work of his own. Besides, the Yogabhāṣya quotes on Y. 8. I. 28 a verse, which is Vispupurāṇa229 VI. 6. 2. The Viṣnupurāṇa is one of the earliest among extant Purānas (vide above pp. 907-909 ) and cannot be assigned to a date later than the 3rd century A. D. Therefore, the Yogabhāṣya which quotes the Mahābhārata and the Viṣnupurāṇa may be assigned to about 4th century A. D. As argued above, the Y. S. would therefore have to be assigned to a date not later than the 2nd or 3rd century A, D. Though the present writer holds that the Yoga that is said to be refuted in V. S. IL 1.3 is not that of the Yoga Sūtra but the Yoga found in the Santiparva, yet he is not prepared to place the present Yogasūtra earlier than the 2nd century B. O. Mr. K, K, Kolhatkar in his very exhaustive and learned Introduction (in Marathi) asserts (on p. 126 ) that the Yogasūtra is later by 3000 years than the Brahmasūtra and that the Bhagavadgita was composed about 5000 years before the present day (p. 224). But he adduces no evidence for such an ancient date for that work. He probably relies on the traditions that Vyāsa, the reputed author of the Mahābhārata (including the Gitā ), flourished towards the end of the Dvāpara age and that Kaliyuga started in 3179 B. O. Modern critical scholarship doos not accept these traditional datings.</p>
<p>Not only do some of the Upaniṣads contain references to Yoga technique and practices, but the Mahābhārata also dilates upon matters that pertain to the domain of Yoga. A few examples may be referred to here (the cr. ed. of the Mahābhārata in relied upon ). In the Santiparva, chap. 232 ( 241 of Ch, ed.)</p>

<p>History of Dharmatāstra (800. VIII, OL. XXXII</p>
<p>it is stated 239 that kāma (desires), krodha (anger), lobha (covetousness ), bhaya (fear) and svapna (sleep) are the five dosas ( disturbances ), in the path of Yoga and then it proscribos means for mastering them. An important and striking assertion in that chapter is that even a person of the lowest rurṇa ( class ) or &amp; woman who is intent on dharma may reach the highest goal by following this path 2298 (of Yoga ). The same chapter laya down (in verse 25 ) the proper places for the residence of a yogin and for the practice of Yoga, viz untenanted mountains and caves, temples, vacant houses, in order that ekāgratā (one pointedness of mind) may be achieved and that the yogin should treat in the same way a person who commends him or who speaks ill of him and should not contemplate the befalling of good or evil on any one. Chapter 289 of the Santiparva refers to Dhārapā ( verge 37 ) and states that a yogin that hag attained 2.99 spiritual power may transfer himself to thousands of other bodies and move about in those bodies on the earth and that this path ( of Yoga ) is regarded as difficult of access even to wise brāhmaṇas and no one can tread it with ease and that ona can stand easily on the sharp edges of razors, but to abide in Dhāraña of Yoga is difficult for those whose souls are not purified. Śāntiparva 304. 1 states that there is no knowledge equal to Saṅkhya and no spiritual power equal to Yoga; it further says that Yoga is eightfold ( vorge 7 ) and in verse 9 mentions</p>

<p>.. Similarities between yogasūtra and Gita</p>
<p>1401</p>
<p>Dharana and Prāṇāyāma. The Asvamedhikaparva 19. 17 (Ch. ed.) appears to refer to pratyāhāra.2300</p>
<p>There is also striking similarity between the Bhagavadgitā and the Yogasūtra. 2301 For example, the definition of Yoga in the Yogasūtra as the &lsquo;mastery over (or elimination of) the functions (or fluctuations) of the mind&rsquo; has a close parallel in the Gitā. The Gitā insists on the yogin being &lsquo;aparigraba&rsquo; (VI. 10); &lsquo;aparigpha&rsquo; is one of the five yamas (Y. S. II, 30 ). Similarly, the seat and posture (āsana) in which a yogin is to practise must be stable ( this refers to the seat) and comfortable (says Yogasūtra ); the Gitā says the same thing in greater detail. In VIII, 12 the Gitā speaks of Yogadharapā. The Gitā says (in VI, 35 ) that the mind is certainly restless and difficult to control, but it can be controlled by practice and passionlessness and the Y. S. (I. 12 ) speaks of the same two means. The Gita (in V. 4-5) emphasizes that it is the ignorant that regard Saṅkhya and Yoga as different, that he who applies himself or stands com mitted to one of these secures the fruit held out by both and that he who bees both ways as identical soos truly. Hore Saṅkhya means (sannyāsa) renunciation&rsquo; and Yoga means * Karma yoga',</p>
<p>The Yogasūtra of Patañjali nowhere expressly sets out its scheme of the evolution of the world. But it contains enough material to enable us to hold that it presupposes and accepts some of the Saṅkhya doctrines such as the theory of Pradhana, the three guṇas and their characteristics, the real nature of the individual self and kaivalya (the state of the soul in final liberation). This may be established by a few references to Y.S. Y, S. III. 48 describes the results that ensue to the yogin from subjugation or mastery of the organs ( indriyas), one of which is</p>

<p>History of Dharmatāstra (Sec. VIII,CXXX</p>
<p>pradhanajaya 2302 ( subjugation of Pradhana. the primary cause of the world according to the Bankhya). The Y. 8. nowhere describes what Pradhana is and what its evolutes are. Therefore, it follows that it takes over from the Saṅkhya all that is geid about Pradhana. About the individual soul the Y. 8. states tha seer (Purusa) exiats zz03 as merely pure capacity of awareness (or as the mere power of seeing) and although pure (changeles or undefiled or free from any taints) appears as if he soos all tiporiences that really pertain to Buddhi).' The characteristics of the three guṇas (sattva, rajas and tamas) are clearly and succintly 1305 stated in Y. 8. as in 8. Kārikā 13, when it gaye *tbe seen (phenomenal universe) is characterized by light (sattva ), activity (rajas ) and inertia or dullness (tamas), it is the essence of the elements and organs and it exists for the purpose of giving experience and liberation (to the soul)'. The guṇas are frequently referred to in Y. 8. 1. 16, IV. 13, 32, 34 and satraguna in Y. S. II, 41, III. 33, 49 and 55. The Y. 8. postulates three pramūnas (in 1.7), but does not define them; the 8. Kāriki (4-6) mentions the same three pramāgas and briefly defines them. They both agree about the plurality of souls It may further be noted that Vyasabhāsya on Y. S. is full of Saṅkhya doctrines and quotes, according to Vācaspati, Pancasikha twelve times and Şasṭitantra once (vide above p. 1374 and . 2250 ).</p>
<p>In spite of the fact that the Yogasūtra accepts some of the fundamental doctrines of the Bankhya, there are certain points of difference between the two. The standard Saṅkhya finds zo placa for God (Isvara ) i. e. it is frankly atheistic ( if theism means belief in God who is the creator of the universe and regulator of rewards and punishments), while Yoga finds a place for God in</p>

<p>The place of Itzura in Yogasūlra</p>
<p>1403</p>
<p>Y. 8, nowhere expressly says that Isvara is the creator of the world and all that it says about Him is that in him omniscience is at its highest, that He was the teacher of primal sages and that by repetition of the mystio syllable &lsquo;om&rsquo; and reflection on it the yogin attains correct knowledge of the real nature of the self. In the next place, though the summum bonum in both systems is called kaivalya (8. Kārikā 64, 68 and Y. 8. III, 50, 55, IV, 34 ), yet the Sāṅkhya does not get out any elaborate discipline for attaining it except correct knowledge, that is, it is metaphysical and rational, while the Y, S. gives an elaborate treatment on mind discipline, insists on effort rather than inere jñāna, attaches great importance to prāṇāyāma and meditation (dhyāna) and is psychological.</p>
<p>The Saṅkhya postulated that an intellectual understanding of the nature of purusa and of praksti (or gunas ) and of the difference between the two was sufficient for the emancipation of the individual self from the liability to rebirth, while yoga, on the other hand, was not content with this philosophic easy-going mental frame and emphasized systematic training of the will and emotions. In both Sāṅkhya and Yoga each individual soul is eternal and his destiny is to become free from the influence of Prakrti and its evolutes and to remain for ever the same ( vig. pure intelligence ). Herein they differ from the Advaita Vedānta, According to which the final destiny of the self is to become absorbed in and one with brahma.</p>
<p>There is another matter for consideration. In the Yājña valkya-smrti, Yajnavalkya is put forward as saying that the Boul shining like a lamp in the heart should be realized, that on such realization the soul is not born again and as adding that for the purpose of attaining to Yoga one should understand the Aranyaka 2305 which &lsquo;I received from the Sun and also the</p>

<p>Mixtury of Dhurmushstra 1 Sec. VIII, Ch. XXXII</p>
<p>Yogaśāstra propounded by me.&rsquo; In the Kūrmapurana it 18 Baid. that Yājñavalkya composed Yogaśāstra at the order of Hara&rsquo;and the Vispupurāpa (IV. 4 107) states that Hirapyanabha attained the knowledge of Yoga from the great Yoglāvara Yajnavalkya who was a pupil of Jaimini. In the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Up. (II. 4) Yajñavalkya tells his wife Maitreyi (who hankered after immortality and cared daught for worldly goods) that he would expound to her the path to immortality and the very first sentence calls upon her to cultivate &lsquo;nididhyāga&rsquo; (i. e, dhyana) and the first part of his discourse onds with the memorable words (ātmā vā are drastavyaḥ śrotavyo mantavyo nididhy. sitavyah, Bṛ, Up. II, 4.5). What work is meant by the Yoga Śāstra composed by Yāj. is a debatable point. There are three works (other than the Yāj. smrti) connected with the name of Yājñavalkya viz. &hellip; Vļddha-Yājñavalkya, Yoga-Yajñavalkya and Bṭbad-yogi-yājñavalkya (vide H. of Dh, Vol I. p. 188-190). The last has beon published by Kaivalyadbama, Lonavla (1951), the Yoga-Yaj. was published in T. S. S. (1938) based on a single ms., then in the JBBRAS (vol. 28 and 29 ) by Shri P. C. Diwanji and now available in book form (1954). This last is in the form of a dialogue between the great yogin Yājöavalkya and Gārgi (who is identified with Maitreyi by Shri Diwanji on pp. 27-28 of his ed. of 1954 ) and sages and learned brāhmaṇas. Yājñavalkya narrates what he learnt from Brahmā. On Yāj. III. 110 the Dipakalikā of Sulapāṇi remarks that the Yogasāstra referred to is called. Yogiyājñavalkya&rsquo;. But this again leads to uncertainty as both the works viz. that published by Kaivalya dhama and the one by Mr. Diwanji are 80 referred to as Yogi (or Yoga) Yajñavalkya in several digests. Mr. Diwanjia306 tries hard to establish that the work published by him &lsquo;has a better claim to be adjudged the specific work on Yoga referred to in Yaj. III. 113.&rsquo; I think that the claim is not at all justified. The work edited by Mr. Diwanji no doubt contains a good deal of Yoga knowledge; while the work published by Kaivalyadhama also contains &amp; good deal of Yoga material, though not as much as the work edited by Mr. Diwanji containg. It would be irrelevant to discuss here all the points made by Mr. Diwanji. The procent author is convinced that the work sponsored by Mr. Diwanji is not the work referred to by Yājóavalkya (in his smrti III. 110). It is a compilation of a later period. Some striking</p>

<p>Discussion of authorship of Yoga-yājñavalkya</p>
<p>1405</p>
<p>matters alone may be pointed out to show that the Yoga</p>
<p>Yājñavalkya oould not have been the work of the author of the Bpbadāraṇyaka and the Yogaśāstra (as stated in Yāj. III. 110 ) and of Yaj, smrti. In the Bṛ. Up. II. 4. 1 and IV.5.1 (Yājña valkyasya dve bhārye babhūvatur-Maitreyi ca Katyayani ca ) it is expressly stated that Yajāavalkya had two wives, (philosophy minded) Maitreyi and Kātýāyan! (worldly-minded). Maitreyi desired such knowledge as would lead to immortality and she asks questions, in all of which she addresses Yājsavalkya as * bhagavān&rsquo; (in Bṛ. Up. II. 4. 3 and 13 and IV. 5. 4, 14) and never as mere Yājñavalkya. On the other hand, Gārgi in the Bṛ, Up, is called Vacaknavi (in III. 6. 1, 1II. 8.1 and 12 ), is not Yajnavalkya&rsquo;s wife but a pert and rationalistic woman inquirer like Afvala, Artabhāga, Bhujyu Lāhyāyani, Uṣasta Cākrāyaṇa, Kahola (all present in the court of Janaka), who including Gārgi questioned the claim of Yājöavalkya to be regarded as * brahmiṣtha'. In Bṛ. Up. III, 6.1 when Gārgi pursues her ratiocination too far (in matters depending upon āgama and being beyond reasoning ) Yājñavalkya reprimande her and says that she would die (lit: her head would fall away) if she pursued the subject in &amp; pure logistic way. All those inquirers address Yājñavalkya as mere Yājñavalkya without any honorifio epithet like &lsquo;bhagavān&rsquo; and Gārgi does the same (in Bṛ. Up. III. 6, 1, III. 8. 2-6). Aoc, to Yāj. Smrti III. 110 the Br. Up., a Yoga. śāstra and the smrti are the works of one man (whose two wives were Maitreyl and Katyayani) and who had a philosophical skirmish with Gārgl Vācaknavi ( according to the Br. Up.). The present Yogayājñavalkya (ed. by Mr. Diwanji) makes Gārgi wife of Yājñavalkya 2307 ( vadhūḥ). One would like to know whether Yaj. had three wives, as Bș. Up. says he had only two. Mr. Diwanji (pp. 27-28 of the ed, of 1954) tries to make light of this discrepanoy and regards Maitreyi as another name of Gārgi. We are here con cerned not with pure Yoga dootrines but with the question</p>

<p>ray Aura N. The two as may be noted; that would ordinarily show that it and it were different. It might be argued that having already learnt from Yāj. (io Bṛ. Up.) Maitreyi was present but took do part in the discussion and Gārgi alone asked questions. Verse 6 of chap. I could. be considered as using the words उत्तमा व tor मैत्रेयी and the words महाभांगी and are as applicable to troll, but this is made impossible by the text which lo I. 43 and IV. 5 refers to Girgi as the wife (bhāryā) of Yāj. and phe is addressed as &lsquo;priye&rsquo; (IV. 7), &lsquo;vapārohe&rsquo; pic.</p>

<p>History of Dhurnu dārīru</p>
<p>Sec. VIII, Ch. XXXII</p>
<p>whether a work attributed to Yaj. which makes Gārgi the wife of the ancient Yājāavalkya ( when the Upaniṣad makes her only a more or loss insolent woman) can be regarded as the work of the same Yāj. who propounded brahmavidyā in the Br. Up. and is supposed to have composed the Yāj. smrti. This ono circums bance alone is onough to brand the Yoga-Yajñavalkya ( of Mr. Diwanji) as a fabrication sought to be passed off as an ancient work. If identity was really meant the verso could easily bave been read as &lsquo;Maitreyyākhyā mahābhāgā&rsquo; without any metrical fault. Therefore, it is not possible to hold that Yogayājñavalkya is the Yogaśāstra composed by Yājñavalkya before the Smrti going under his name was composed. A few other decisive grounds may also be urged. The work edited by Mr. Diwanji moptions Tantras ( in V. 10) and Tantrikas (in VIII. 4 and 25 ). The Yāj. smrti nowhere mentions these two and is free from the peculiar Tantrik words or technique. Therefore, the present Yogayājñavalkya edited by Mr. Diwanji was composed long after the Yāj. smrti and probably in the 8th century or after when Tantrik rites and works had become common. One more important matter may be adverted to. The Yāj. sınti and the Yoga-Yājñavalkya ( ed. by Mr. Diwanji ) both enumerate ten yamas and ten niyamas. But the two diverge materially in the ten names as the note below will show, 2008 The number of yamas and niyamas differs in different works, but if the Yāj. smrti and Yoga-Yājñavalkya were the works of the same author, the differences in the ten names would not have ocourred at all. Therefore, the author of the Yāj. empti is quite different from the author of the Y. Y. There is no evidence for holding that the latter flourished before the Sth or 9th century A. D.</p>
<p>A good deal has been said by Mr. Diwanji in his paper on * Bṛbad-yogi-yājñavalkya and Yoga-Yajñavalkya' in ABORI, VOL. XXXIV (1953) pp. 1-29, in his preface to Yoga-Yājāavalky&amp; in JBBRAS, volumes XXXVILI and XXXIX pp. 103-106 and by Swami Kuvalayanand in his reply in ABORI, vol. XXXVII for</p>

It would not be relevant in this work to discuss the points in dispute between Mr. Diwanji and Swami Kuvalayanand. In the bhāsya on the Svetāśvataropaniṣad attributed to Saṅkarācārya 2309 (published by Anan, Press) on p. 28 four Ferses and a half are quoted from Yogi-Yajśavalkya, none of which is found either in Br. Y. Y. or Y. Y. Besides on Sv. Up. II. 9 (pp. 42-44) 29 verses on Yoga matters are quoted in the bhāṣya, but the name of the author or work whence the quotations are taken is not mentioned. Not one of the 29 verses wholly occurs in Mr. Diwanji&rsquo;s Y, Y. He is able to point out only five or six half verses as occurring in Y, Y. out of the 29 versos, while a whole yerse quoted in the bhāṣya (viz.&lsquo;prāṇāyāmair&rsquo; &amp;c ) occurs in Bṛ. Y. Y. (8. 32 ). (It may be further pointed out that Aparārka and the Smrticandrika quote in all about 100 verses from Yogi (or Yoga-) Yājśavalky&amp; which are found in Bs. Y. Y., but not in Y. Y. The Kṛtyakalpataru (on Mokṣakāṇda alone ) quotes (on pp. 146, 149, 166, 171, 196-197) about 70 verses from Yogi-yājāvalky&amp; which are found in chapters 2, 8, 9 and 11 of the Br. Y. Y, Mr. Diwanji has not been able to show that verses of the Y. Y. (ed, by him ) are cited anywhere in the above three digests. Mr. Bhabatosh Bhattacarya in his paper on Yogi-Yajāavalkya-gmṛti and its utilization in the medieval digests of Bengal and Mithila (in J.G. J. R. I, vol XV for 1958 pp. 135–140 ) points out that king Ballālasena of Bengal (1158–1179 A, D.) in his Dānasāgara contains a fairly large number of quotations from the Bșhad-Yogi Yaj. (pub. by Kaivalya-dhama). It appears that Viśvarūpa2210 (first half of 9th century A.D.) quotes a half verse from the Br. Y.Y. and remarks that the work is composed by the author of the Yāj.</p>

The present author is not, however, prepared to hold that Br. Y. Y. is the Yogaśāstra of Yāj. mentioned in Yāj. sifti III, 110, since the Yoga material contained in it is meagre as compared with the Smrti material. The present author ia glad to find that on pp. 7-8 of the Sanskrit Preface to the edition of the Bșhad-Yogi-Yājñavalkya-smrti the editors express grave doubts about the identity of the author of the Yāj. smṛti with the author of the work edited by them.</p>
<p>The Yogavāsiṣtha is an extensive work in 32000 ślokag (ope sloka meaning 32 syllables) printed in two volumes with &amp; gomventary by Anandabodha by the Nirn. Press.

Its text appears to have been added to from time to time. Controversies have raged about its date and its contribution to Indian philosophy. The present writer holds on reading the contributions 2312 that the extant Yogavāsiṣtha is a late work and was composed some time between the 11th and 13th century A. D.</p>

<p>In this connection (i.e. on the topic of bhumis) the present . author has to bring to the notice of readers a paper by Shri Kuvalayānanda contributed to the Yogamlmāmgā vol VI. No. 4 on Traditional reading of Pātañjala-yogagūtra III. 11; is it accurate.&rsquo; The traditional reading accepted by the bhāṣya of Vyāsa and all other commentators is &lsquo;Sarvārthataikāgratayoh kṣayodayau cittasya samadhipariṇāmah&rsquo;.\ The Svami2314 argues that the correct reading should be &lsquo;sarvarthatailarthayoh &amp;c.&rsquo; He states that the bhūmis should be six, the sixth being &lsquo;ekārtha&rsquo; and bases his arguments on the combined explanations of Yoga sūtra I. 2-4, 18 and III. 9-12. All that the present writer can say is that his arguments deserve serious consideration. The fact that even Vyāsa, the bhāsyakāra of Yogasūtra, would have to be held not to have seen the difficulties in the traditional reading of Y. S. III. 11 would have to be given due weight before any final conclusion can be arrived at. That sūtra states the goal of Yoga viz. the soul that is seer abides in its own form then (i.e. when the functions of the mind have been mastered), while in ordinary life the soul appears to assume the forms of the fluctua tions of the mind.

S. IV. 29). Sūtras 17 and 18 of first pāda deal respectively with samprajñāta samadhi (conscious concentration) or sālambabasamādhi and asamprajñāta-samādbi (concentration in which there is no con sciousness of objects, gross or subtle). The first is of four kinds (or of four stages) viz. savitarka (deliberation over or realiza tion of a gross object like Sālagrāma or the image of a god with four arms and the like), savicāra ( where there is reflection over &amp; subtle object such as the tan-mātrās), sānanda where the reflection is on the mind which is full of sattva (that is a samadhi of joy ) and sāsmitarūpa (i. e. where there is only a sense of personality in which the knower himself is the objeot of perception). 2318 These four kinds lead on to the asamprajñātam samādhi, which results when all vșttis have disappeared, when there is persistent exercise of this state and the mind consists of subliminal impressions only. Sūtras 19-51 (to the end of the first pāda) deal with the different kinds of samadhi, the different ways of attainment, the position of Iśvara in the Yoga system, the nine obstacles (antarāya) that cause distraction of the mind of the person who practices Yoga and the companions of these</p>

It is somewhat surprising that one kind of samadhi is characterized by .asmitā'. Probably ascitā bere means no more than tbe conciousness &lsquo;I am&rsquo; (i. e. of personality).

<p>The Patañjalasutra ( in I. 19-23 ) divides yogins for asamprajñāta-samadhi into various categories (nine in all), which are passed over here. Patanjali says that asamprajñata gamādhi in the case of yogins (who are not gods or not those whose bodies are resolved into primary matter) follows upon that practice which effects the cessation of all vșttis and wbiob com prises only subliminal consciousness and is preceded by faith, perfect repose or serenity, energy, mindfulness and discriming tory insight (into what is real) due to passionlessness. It would be noticed that so far Patañjali asks the aspirant for Yoga to rely on his own efforts, practice &amp;c. He does not mention God or his grace anywhere so far. From this it follows that any man or woman and even one who is an agnostic may pursue yogio practices and attair to asamprajñāta-samadhi and liberation without devotion to God or without God&rsquo;s grace. But Patafjali as a keen psychologist know the help that faith affords. Therefore, he provides that, if you believe in God, He will help you in the praotice of Yoga and from that point of view he assigns to Isvara a role of a limited scope.</p>

The mystic syllable (Om) is exprassive of (i. e. representative or symbol of) God and japa of that syllable and constant reflection upon the meaning of &lsquo;om&rsquo;(i. e. on Isvara ) leads to one-pointed ness (ekāgrata) of mind. Devotion to Tývara secures for the practitioner attainment of right knowledge of the nature of the soul and the absence of hindrances (antarāya) that distract the mind (1. 29). These bindrances are nine such as illness, langour, doubt &amp;c. and they are also called Yogamala ( taints or blemishes of Yoga), the enemies (prutipakṣa) of Yoga These hindrances aro aocompanied by pain, mental distress, tremor of the limbs, irregular inhalation and exhalation (I. 31). These distractions and their accompaniments that are the foos of samadhi may be prevented or mastered in various ways such as practice of con centration on one entity (Isvara or the like), by the practice of such attitudes of mind as friendliness, compassion, cheerful ness and indifference respectively towards the happy or the distressed, the good and the evil (133) or by the expulsion and retention of breath (bhāsya uses the word &lsquo;prāṇāyāma&rsquo;). When the mind is concentrated then arise the four kinds of samprajñā. tanamādhi (called savitarka &amp;c. in I. 17). The knowledge that is gained in the last kind of samprajñātasamādhi is of a higher order than what is obtained from scripture or inference and the subliminal impression made in this samadhi is hostile to all other impressions and when this last impression also is suppr. essed or removed, then results the seedless samādhi (i. e. asampr ajñātasamadhi).

<p>Pada II. The first pāda ends on the note of samadhi and liberation i. e, describes the Yoga for him who has succeeded in concentration. The 2nd pāda deals with the procedure for &amp; person whose miod is not used to concentration but is rostless, infatuated or distracted (vyutthita ) 2321 and who is desirous of learning the technique. This pāda is the most important of all the four padas for modern students, either Indian or Western, and has exerted great influence on Dharmaśāstra works. The fundamental idea of Yoga is that the individual self is real, eternal and pure, but it is immersed in the objective world and, though eternal, pursues transient objects. Patanjali is a master psychologist. The goal being set ( viz how to secure the isola tion of the soul from aridya and the gunos and its attainment of its own pure nature) Y. S. proscribes a rigorous discipline for the attainment of the goal. Patanjali differs from many modern Western psychologists (like Freud) 2322 in two very fundamental matters. The first is that Patañjali puts all emphasis at bis comipand on the freedom and liberation of the soul from bond. age, prescribes restraint of the activities of the mind as the</p>

<li>Freud gives the name &ldquo;libido&rsquo; to the energy of the sexual instinct, wbile Jung. who was once a disciple of Frend, diverged from Fread, bolds it as applicable to all forms of mental, psycho-physical or conative energy. The theory of the Oedipus complex is the cestral core of the Preudian system. It appcars that Freud later in life modified his theory of tbe Oedipus complex and, though be assumed that the Oedipus complex is present in every infant, he came to bold that in tbe course of aormal development the complex becomes eradicated in early child bood.

<p>means and several preliminary steps of the training of ordinary emotions and will, while several modern psychologists condemn repression of the mind. In the 2nd place Patañjali is a firm believer in the doctrine of karma and rebirth and (in II. 12-15) holds that even good actions that give rise to a future life of pleasure and happiness are a misory to the enlightened, while modern paychologists speak of several innate instinots and are not at all agreed on what these are, they do not tackle the problem of karma and rebirth and their relation to what they call instincts. If there is no pre-existince of the soul as Christians and many others believe, how do the human instincts arise? There is hardly any convincing or satisfactory explanation of this.</p>
<p>The first sūtra (of pāda II) says that the activities or practices that are preliminaries to the attainment of Yoga are tapas 2323 (austerity ), svādhyāya and devotion to īśvara; these,</p>

<p>target &amp;c:), Prasna Up. V.5 (Yah punar-etam trimatrenomtty stenaivaksarepa param purusam-abhidhyayita). The Y. S. borrows this importance of Om froin the Upaniṣads. The five klesas are defined in Y. S. II. 5-9. Avidya (ignorance)2325 consists in regarding the non-aternal as eternal, the impure as pure, pain as pleasure, the non-self as the self. Asmita (senge of personality) consists in the seer (the self) being held as if identical with the instruments of seeing (such as mind and sense organs). Abhiniveśa (clinging to life) means the craving (&lsquo;May I not cease to live, may I live&rsquo;) which sweeps on by its own force and is established in this form even among the learned. Tsvarapranidhana has been explained above (p. 1413 note 2319). The Y. S. (II. 11 and 12) says that the klesas have subtile con ditions (viz. avidyā and asmitā ) and coarse effects in the form of vrttis (the fluctuations of the mind, raga, dvesa and abhinivesa); escape from the former is secured by resolving them by means of real knowledge while the coarse ones are controlled by contemplation (dhyāna). The accumulated deposits of Karma arise from the five kleśas, are fit to be experienced in the seen birth (that is in the present birth) and in an unseen (i.e. future) birth. So long as the root (viz. the klesas) exists the accumulated karma leads to fruition in three forms viz. birth, life (long or short) and experience, which three result in giving joy or</p>

Sūtra 28 provides that when impurities are washed away by practising the angaṣ of Yoga, the knowledge shines forth (more and more till discriminatory discernment becomes perfect. Then sūtra2376 29 enumerates the eight angas (aids, or auxiliaries) of Yoga, viz. yama (abstinences), niyama (observances), āsana (bodily posture ), prānāyāma (control or regulation of breath ), pratyābāra (withdrawal or suppression of the organs of sense ), dhāraṇā (fixed attention ), dhyana ( meditation or contemplation ), samadhi (concentration or absorption into the objeot of medita tion).

The fives mentioned in यो.. IL.3 are called विपर्यय. It is somewhat surprising that the eight aigas &lsquo;यम&hellip;समाधयोटापानि (ia prose) are quoted as from AETICA in the eye (ATTE . 167) and by 9451 p. 1022. The area (B. I. ed.) VIII. 10 divides yogins into three classes owing to the differences in their practices and abstentions, viz.सारक एकार्य and विसरग, and each of these is again subdivided into farther sob-classes. It further states that some of these called Abirodhakāā do not practise prāṇāyāma, others called Mārgagāḥ practise only prāṇāyāma and the rest and those called vimārgagāḥ practise all the eight angas, but they regard even God that is proper for contemplation as not so. The origioal words are partiet Yafaa &hellip; 4rgegaan vaqt4Fq4gafa. It is difficult to say what the last clause exactly means. It is probable that in this sentence reference is made to some class of yogias that do not contem plate on God, but hold that without contemplation on God they cao secure liberation (kaivalya, mukti).Yamas and niyamas defined and explained 1419 angas of Yoga. The remaining sūtrag of pāda two (from 30 to 55) deal with the enumeration and definitions of yamas and niyamas, their explanations and the treatment of asana, prāṇāyāma and pratyābāra. The Santiparva (304.7 = 316.7 of Ch. ed.) speaks of Yoga as &lsquo;aṣtagupita&rsquo; or aṣtagupin). Out of the eight asgas the first five are indirectly useful for samadhi, because they eradicate what are opposed to samādhi (such as hithea, agatya &amp;c.), and are therefore called bahiranga ( external, indirect) sādhanas (means) of Yoga, while dhāraṇā, dhyana and samādhi are said to be antaranga to Yoga (Y. S. II. 7, &lsquo;trayam-antarangam pūryebhyah&rsquo;. The last three are dealt with in the 3rd pāda. It is these sūtras in the 2nd pāda that are emphasized and elaborated in Dharmaśāstra works. Therefore some detailed treatment of these matters is needed here.</p>
<p>In some works, such as the Gorakṣasemhitā the angas of yoga are said to be only six (omitting yama and niyama or omitting some others). The Maitrāyani Up. (VI, 18), the Dhyānabindu Up. the Atri-smrti XL 6, Daksa VII. 34, Skandapurāṇa, Kāśikhaṇda, 41. 59 and Buddhists say the same. Manu 2327 provides (IV. 204) &lsquo;&amp; wise man should always practise yamas but not the niyamas always; one who only practises niyamas and does not practise yamas incurs sin (or falls into hell)&rsquo;. This does not mean that niyamas are forbidden but it means only this that yamas are far more im portant than niyamas. The words &lsquo;yama&rsquo; and &lsquo;niyama&rsquo; both occur in the Santiparva (or. ed. 326. 15 and 339.16 of Oh, ed.). Some Smrtis omit them from the angas of yoga probably because they are proscribed for all persons in general by Manu, Yāj. and others. Manu does not enumerate yamas and niyaman, but Yāj. (quoted on p. 1406, n. 2303 above) enumerates ten yamas and ten niyamas. The five yamas 228 of the Y. S. are</p>

<p>alimsū (non injury to all creatures and at all times), satya ( truthfulness ), asteyu (non-stealing i. e, not appropriating others&rsquo; things in a way not sanctionod by the Siatra ), brahma arya (i. e. control of the organ of generation while guarding the other organs of sense also), aparigrala (non-acceptance of anything from another beyond what is necessary for preserving the body). These five constitute for a yogin a great viata when practised without reference to species, place, time and occasions (or exigencios). As provided by Manu, yainas have to be observed by all but there are exceptions. The observanco of yamas would be called vrata, but the rigorous observance of yamas without allowing exceptions is called by the Y. 8. mahāvrata which has to be observed by yogins without oxception at all stages. The observance of yamas and niya mas is a first step for the soul&rsquo;s ultimate success in winning Liberation or Isolation (kaivalya), since, unless the soul is purged of all sexual and egoistic desires, it cannot live the divine or spiritual life that the higher stages of yoga require. What is meant may be briefly exem plified as follows: Smptis recognize some exceptions to all these in the case of ordinary people. For example, it is the kṣatriya&rsquo;s duty to fight and therefore it was provided by Manu (VII, 87,89) that a ksatriya should not run away from battle and that kṣatriyas fighting and dying in battle on both sides went to heaven. Vide Yaj. I. 324. So him was allowed to a ksatriya but if he wanted to follow the Yoga discipline he had to give up himsā. Similarly, Smrtis excused untruth on five occasions (vide Gautama 23. 29, Vasistha 16. 36, Adiparra 82. 16, Santi parva 34, 25 and 165, 30, quoted in H. of Dh, vol. III. p. 353 and notes 536, 537 ). Mapu in IV. 138 makes an exception for ordinary men viz. one should not speak what though true is painful to another (na brūyat satyamapriyam). But one who enters on the discipline of Yoga must always speak the truth except when speaking the truth would result in the ruin of</p>

III. 312 remarks that telling a falsehood in the case of arranging a marriage though excused (by smśtis) should be avoided and also the beating of a son or a pupil as punishment by one who observes a vrata. A householder who approaches his wife on certain specified days after her monthly illness and avoids the paryan days (vide H. of Dh. vol. III n 1425) is to be regarded as one observing brahmacarya, acc. to Yaj. I. 79 and Manu IV. 128, but if he takes to the path of Yoga, he would have to give up this latitude (vide note 2308, 2330 above) and avoid all contact whatever with all women including his own wife as the Lingapurāṇa empha sizes. The Yuktidipikā, one of the earliest commentaries on the Saṅkhyakārikā, mentions (on p. 112) five yamas but puts &lsquo;akalkata&rsquo; (absence of crookedness) as the 5th instead of aparigraha, The Vishupurana (VI. 7. 36-37) enumerates five yamas and five niyamas as in Y, S. but substitutes &lsquo;mind bent on the highest brahma&rsquo; (kurvita brahmani tathā parasmin pravanani wanah) for Tāvarapranidhāna&rsquo;. The five niyamas according to Y. S. II.32 2331 are sauca (cleanliness), santosa (contentment), tapas (austerity), svādhyāya (study of Veda), iśvarapranidhāna (devotion to God, or SUITondering all actions to him). Three of the five niyamas, viz. tapas, svādhyaya and Isvarapranidhāna constitute kriyāyoga as already stated in Y.S. II.1. It is most difficult to give an objective definition of duty, but duties can be defined on the subjective side. The object of emphasizing duties is to make mon rise above lower desires and to make the higher self shine forth. These are</p>

<p>based more or less on the Upaniṣads; vide e. &amp;. Chān. Up. III. 17. 4 where tapas, ahiinsīī, truthfulness, dāna, (charity) and ārjain (straightforwardness) are put forward as virtues to be cultivated by a sacrificer, Br. Up. V. 2.3. where all mon are asked to cultivate dama (self-restraint), dūna (charity), dayū (kindness). Therefore, the yamas prescribed by the Yogasītra constitute what may be called extra-regarding duties and are mostly in the nature of prohibitions (such as &lsquo;don&rsquo;t injure anyone, don&rsquo;t tell a lie, don&rsquo;t rob a person, don&rsquo;t accept gifts&rsquo;), while the nigamas are concerned with the individual himself (who has embarked On Yoga practice ) and are of a positive character (viz. be clean, be contented, be austere, do study the Veda and be a devotee of Isvara ). The Amarakośa 2332 defines &lsquo;yama&rsquo; as actions that are obligatory (or to be always performed) and that depend upon the body as the means for being carried out, while niyamas are acts that are not obligatory (or not to be continuously engaged in) and that depend ( for carrying thema out) on means that are outside the body (such as water &amp;o). Sauca (cleanliness) is of two kinds, būhya ( of the body effected with water, loose earth, pancagavya, pure food &amp;c.) and ablıyantara (internal or mental). Vide H. of Dh, vol. II, pp. 651 52 and vol. IV. pp. 310-311 for details of the sauca of both kinds. A verse of Manu (V. 106) deserves to be noted 2:33 in this COD Nection viz. &lsquo;of all kinds of sauoa the highest is the one that relates to wealth (one must desire wealth without depriving another of his wealth by improper means); that man is suci (pure) who is pure as to wealth and not he who is purified by loose earth and water.&rsquo; Sūtras 33-34 of pāda II provide that when the practitioner of Yoga is assailed by the outbreak of the fever of perverse thoughts (such as &lsquo;I shall kill him who has harmed me&rsquo;, &lsquo;I shall tell a lie, I shall appropriate another&rsquo;s wealth, I shall commit adultery with another&rsquo;s wife&rsquo;), he should revolve in his mind and cultivate the opposites of such thoughts and dwell on the consequences of such thoughts, viz. they cause endless suffering and lack of right knowledge.

<p>1423</p>
<p>niyama constitute the preliminary ethical code which an aspirant for yoga must observa and some part of it must be followed by all men as Mam and Yaj. prescribe.</p>
<p>In sūtras 35 to 45 (of pāda IL) the results of the continuous practice of the several yamas and niyamas are set out viz. when the aspirant has become established in abimsā, all beings (mon and animals) give up enmity 2334 in his presence. When the aspirant for Yoga is well grounded in the practice of abstinence from falsehood his speech comes out to be effective unfailingly (that is, if he says to a person&rsquo;be you a righteous man&rsquo; or &lsquo;may you attain heaven&rsquo;, the man becomes righteous or attains svarga). When he becomes rooted in abstinence from theft all jawels wait upon him from all quarters (that is, though he may not hanker after riches or mean8, the latter come to him of their own accord). When the Yogin is firmly fixed in brahmacarya, 2335 he securos energy (whereby he treads the path to such super normal powers as animā) and when he reaches perfection he is able to transfer knowledge about Yoga and its angas to his disciples. In Y, S. L 20 it is stated that asamprajñāta-samadhi follows when the yogin has faith, virya (energy) and other qualities. The groatest emphasis is laid on chastity in thought, word and deed for the yogin or the seeker for brahma (vide Mundaka III, 1.5, &lsquo;satyena labhyas-tapasā hyeṣa ātmā samyag jñānena brahmacaryena nityam&rsquo;). The idea is that the yogin makes very rapid progress towards the final goal of samadhi and kaivalya if he is thoroughly chaste and that without it the practice of rajayoga is futile and dangerous. Those interested in the importance of &lsquo;brahmacarya&rsquo; should read Mahātmā Gandhi&rsquo;s &lsquo;self-restraint versus self-indulgence&rsquo; (3rd ed. 1928), particularly the Appendix I. pp. 137-158 which reproduce W.

<p>As a result of having to clean 2336 one&rsquo;s body the Yogin becomes disgusted with his own body and avoids oontact with the bodies of others. Other results of cleanliness (of the mind) that arise are the purity of salt vaguni ( i. e. not being assailed by rajas and tanus), gentleness, one-pointedness (of the mind), mastery over the senses and fitness for the sight (realization) of the Self, From contentment results 2337 supreme happiness. Tapas gives rise 2338 to perfection in the body (i. e. acquisition of some occult powers like animā) and perfection as to the sense organs ( such as being able to hear and to see what is distant) owing to the eradication of impurities (i. e.the klesas and ain); (continuous) study of the Veda (and japa of om &amp;c.) leads on to the union with ( realization of the deity he chooses.

<p>Asana (bodily posture ; 2339 is defined in Y. S. as one that is stable and easy (or comfortable). Āsana means a seat which is covered with kusa grass, deer-skin and a garment in that order ( this would be būhya ūsana) as laid down in Gita (VI. 11),</p>

<p>Asanas in yogasastra</p>

<p>while the word asap, (in Yoga) means bodily posture. It should be noticed that the Yogasūtra does not expressly prescribe any of the numerous asadas mentioned and defined in the Hatha yogapradipika and other works on Hathayoga and indicates that those asanas are not necessary in the practice of the Pātañjala Yoga and that any posture which is easy, stable and comfortable would be enough for the yogin, The Y, S, here follows the Sv. Up. (LI, 8 and 10 ) and not the works on Hatha yoga, if any existed in its times. In order to secure the posture described above the yogin should relax the usual physical movements of the body (prayatnaśaithilya) and bring the mind to reflect on the Infinite (brahma). As a result of perfect mastery over posture, he is not overwhelmed (or overcome) by the pairs of opposites (such as heat and cold, hunger and thirst).</p>
<p>A few words must be said about āsanas. The present author recommends to all those interested in asanas a very useful and instructive handbook (in 188 pages) on asanas&rsquo; composed and published by Sri Kuvalayānanda of the Kaivalyadhāma at Lonavla near Poona (third impression in 1949 ) with 81 platos (78 on different asanas and 3 on nauli). The Dakṣasmrti (VII, 5) mentions Padmāsana and Yāj. in III. 198 appears to allude to it. Dr. K. T. Behanan on &lsquo;Yoga, &amp; scientifio evaluation&rsquo; ingerts 16 figures (between pp. 186-187) of several asanas, Though the Y. 8, does not mention any asana by name yet the Vyāsabhāṣya 2340 names ton and indicates by the word &lsquo;adi&rsquo;</p>

(IV.1. 7-10) has in view, acc. to Saṅkarācārya, the description of asana in the Gitī (VI. 11), the relaxation of bodily activities and stableness of posture indicated by such words as &lsquo;dhyāyatīva prthivi&rsquo;(Chān. Up. VII. 6.1). According to the H. P. (I. 17 ) āsana is the first anga of Hathayoga, that Siva speaks of 84 asanas, of which four āsanas called Siddha, Padma, Simba and Bhadra are the most essential ( sārabhūta) and it recommends Siddhāsapa as the best (I. 31 ) and describes it (1. 35). The Hathayogapradipikā namos and describes 15 āsanas in I. 19-55. The Dhyānabindu Upaniṣad states that there are innumerable āsanas but mentions the same four as the most prominent. Vide figures 16 (p. 55), 18 (p. 57), 62 (p. 97) in Sri. Kuvalayānanda&rsquo;s work for Siddha, Padma and Simha āsanas respectively and figures 105 (p. 186), 106 (p. 187), and 108 (p. 188), for the asanas called Siddha, Padma and Baddha padma respectively in Prof. S. S. Goswami&rsquo;s work on Hathayoga and p. 28-30 for Siddhāsana, Padmasana and Baddha-padmām Bana respectively in Alain Danielou&rsquo;s work (London, 1949). The Sivasambitā (III. 100) and Gherandasainhita (II. 1) men tion that there are 84 āsanas, while the Goraksasataka 2342 states that there are as many asanas as there are living species, that all of them are known to Siva, that out of 84 lakhs of asanas Siva choge 84 and that out of these Siddhāsana and Padmāsana are the best and defines these two (I. 5-9).</p>

<p>Supreme Self may be promoted) in the Bhagavadgita, which itself is described as Yogaśāstra and each chapter of which is also called Yoga. For example, we have in the Gitā &ldquo;abhyāsayoga&rsquo; (8.8, 12. 9), karmayoga (3.3. and 7), jñānayoga (3.3.), bhakti yoga (14,26). A few other works also do the same. Some Western writers speak of several kinds of Yoga such as Mantrayoga, Jñanayoga, Bhaktiyoga, Karmayoga, Rājayoga and Hathayoga (vide&rsquo; Bengal Lancer&rsquo; by F. Yeats-Brown, London, 1930, p. 284), R. C. Oman&rsquo;s &lsquo;The Mystics, ascetics and saints of India&rsquo; p. 172 (ed. of 1905), Geraldine Coster&rsquo;s * Yoga and Western psychology&rsquo; p. 10, Alain Danielou&rsquo;s work pp. 83 ff. (for descriptions of Mantrayoga, Layayoga, Kundaliniyoga &amp;c.). Some late Sang krit works like the Yogatattyopanisad 2343 and Sivasamhita (5.9) speak of four Yogas viz. Mantrayoga, Hathayoga, Laya yoga and Rājayoga. All these have in view the system of Patañjali, but each emphasizes some particular aspect of yoga discipline. But there are really only two main systems of Yoga, viz. the one expounded in the Yogasūtra and its bbāṣya by Vyāsa and the other dealt with in such works as the Gorakṣaśataka, the Hathayogapradīpikā of Svātmārāma-yogin2344 with the commentary called Jyotsna by Brahmānanda Briefly, the difference between the two is that the Yoga of Patañjali con centrates all effort on the discipline of the mind, while Hatha yoga mainly concerns itself with the body, its health, its purity and freedom from diseases. This is illustrated by the facts that Patañjali defines āsana as any posture that is &lsquo;sthirasukba&rsquo;, while works on Hathayoga describe many asanas like Mayūr āsana, Kukkuṭāsana, Siddhāsana, which are deemed to remove</p>

Hathayoga, if practised with proper guidance and perseverance, will not only endow a man with a strong, healthy, pure and active body but also may develop inner strength and happiness. The technique of Hathayoga claims three kinds of results viz. (1) cure of diseases and disorders of the mind also; (2) attainment of supernatural powers called siddhis; (3) leading to Rajayoga and Kairulya.

<p>is expounded only for leading on to.Rājayoga 2346 i.e. Rajayoga is the principal fruit of Hathayoga and not siddhis and Kaivalya is due to Rājayoga. The Hathayogapradipikā enumerates the names of the same eight āngas as Patañjali dogs, but its yamas are ten of which taking a light meal is the principal and ahimsā</p>
<p>is the first among niyamas. Besides the eight angas, it deals specially with Mahamudrā, Khecari, Jalandhara, Uddiyana and Mūlabandha, Vajroli, Amaroli and Sabajoli (I. 26-27). The Hathayogapradīpikā (1. 5-8) mentions that Hathayoga started from Ādinātha (i, e. Śiva) and then enumerates 35 great siddhas in all from Matsyendranātha, Gorakṣanātha onwards. The famous exposition of the Bhagavadgitā by Jñānadeva called Jñanesvari cites at the end the Guruparampara as Ādinātha, Matsyendranātha, Gorakṣanātha, Gabininātha, Nivșttinātba,</p>

<p>There are other differences between the works on Hathayoga and the Patañjala Yoga. According to the Gorakṣagataka and H. Y. P. the main aim of āsana and prānāyāma is to rouge the Kundalini (the vital force in a person slumbering at the base of the spine coiled like a snake) and take it through the several cakras and the Suṣumnānādi to brahmadrāra, while the Y. S. hardly ever dilates upon chakras and nādis, 2317 Several people after reading some modern works on Kuṇdalini are tempted to make efforts to rouge the Kundalini. This is a dangerous experi ment.

<p>that the awakening of the Kundalini is a terrifying experience, that on the first day on which the Kundalini was awakened, the whole body was as it wore on fire and he thought that he was dying and that he drank in three months gallons of milk and clarified butter and ate all the leaves on two nimba troes (pp. 57-58 of the translation). The germ of the dootrine of Dadia in Tantras is found in a verse occurring in Katha Up. VI. 16 and Chān, Up. VIII. 6. 6 &lsquo;there are hundred and one nadis (arteries) of the heart; one of them penetrates the (crown of) head; moring upwards by it, one attains immortality; the others (of the nāc Is ) serve for departing in various directions.&rsquo; The Praśna Up. (IU, 6–7) states that each of 101 nādis has 72 sub-nādia, each of which again has 1000 more. Vide Mundaka Up. II. 2.6. In Chān. Up. VIII. 6. 1 it is stated that the nādis of the heart consist of a subtle gubstance, brown, white, blue, yellow or red in colour. This is probably the germ of the statement of a nādi being called pingalā. The Maitrā. yapi Up. VI. 21 speaks of the nādi going upwards as Suṣumnā.</p>
<p>The Viṣnupurāna mentions Bhadrāsana 2318 which passage is quoted by Vācaspati. The Purāṇas, Vāyu (11.13), Mārkandeye (36.28), Kūrma (II, 11. 43), Libga (I. 8. 86), Garuda (1 238.11) mention the same three āsanas, viz. Svastika, Padma and Ardhāgana, The Viṣpudharmottara-purāṇa (III. 283. 6) pros cribes for dhyāna the asanas called Svastika, Sarvatobhadra, Kamala (Padma) and Paryanka. The Bhagavata III. 28. 8 employs the same words as the Gita VI, 11 about ūsana (viz.</p>

<p>Āgadas are of two kinds, one type being helpful for prāṇā. yāma, meditation and concentration, such as Padma, Siddha and Svastika (figure 20 p. 59 in Su Kuvalayananda&rsquo;a handbook on &lsquo;Asanas&rsquo;). The other kind of asanas are helpful in eradicat ing diseases and for physical culture. But most of them require different physical movements and the final form assumed by these postures would make deep meditation difficult, if not impossible (vide Sirṣāsana figures 24-27 between pp. 62-63 of SM Kuvalayānanda&rsquo;s handbook on Asanas), Barvangasada (figures 33-36) of the same work, Hālāsana (fig. 42-47 of the same), Viparitakarani (figures 77-78 pp, 121-123), Mayurasana</p>

The Tejobindu Upaniṣad I. 23 (Adyar ed )2349 holds that alone is (proper) asana which makes continuous meditation on brahma possible; other postures only lead to dis comfort.&rsquo; It should not be supposed that one who seeks higher yogio disciplines must devote some time to -āsanas and then pass on to the next stage. The asanas are primarily meant for physical culture and eradication of diseases. If the individual yogin possesses a tolerably sound body he may proceed with prāṇāyāma and other angas. Besides the postures, the practi tioner of Yoga is asked to gaze steadily at the tip of his nose (Gita VI. 13).</p>

<p>Some regulations are prescribed about the food to be taken or avoided by a seeker after Yoga and about the places where he is to practise. The Śāntiparva 2350 of the Mahābhārata provides that the yogin should subsist on cooked small particles of grains, or oilcakes and should avoid oily substances and even when subsisting on yāvaka (i, e. kulmāṣa or cooked barley grains) for long, he would still be strong; he should drink water and milk mixed together and should resort to oaves. The Mārkandeya. purāṇa (q. by Krtyakalpataru on Mokṣa pp. 167–177) states &lsquo;The yogin should begin meditation in unoccupied spots, in forests, caves and should avoid practising Yoga in noisy places, near fire and water, in old cowsheds, where four roads meet, near a heap of dried leaves, on a river bank, in a cemetery or in a place where creeping oreatures exist, in a dangerous place, near a well, near a caitya (funeral ground) or an anthill&rsquo;. The same purāṇa says that he should not practise when bis stomach is windy, or he is hungry or tired or when disturbed in mind, nor when it is very cold or hot or windy.

<p>presoribes that a yogin should practise meditation in a shrine, empty house, mountain cave, on the sands of a river, in gave, or in a forest, in &amp; pure spot free from danger. H. Y. P. I. 61 and 64 prescribe what foods to avoid and what foods may be eaten. The Goraksaśataka 2352 prescribes that the yogin should give up pungent, suur and salted food and should subsist on milk diet. The Gita (VI. 16-17) says &lsquo;one cannot succeed in Yoga who eats too much nor one who observes total fast and Yoga renoves pain for himn who takes proper food and exercise. The Chan. Up. (VII. 26. 2) where Sanatkumāra gives instruo tion to Nārada about the Reality remarks Purity of the mind follows on purity of food &amp;o. (ābāraśuddbau sativa</p>
<p>śuddhiḥ&rsquo; &amp;c.). Apararka on Yaj. I. 154 quotes a long prose passage (ou p. 271) from Harita &ldquo;one should be pure and should subsist on a linnited quantity of food that would be enough or useful for his purpose as the acāryas say &lsquo;purity of mind &hellip;food&rdquo;. It is clear that Hārita takes the words &ldquo;ābārasuddhau &amp;c.&rsquo; literally, while Saṅkarācārya in his bhāsya on Chān, takes āhāra to mean&rsquo; experience of objects of sense such as Sabda&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Prāṇāyāma-It is this anga of Yoga that figures most in the works on Dharmaśāstra from the earliest times. Literally the word means &lsquo;restraint or pause of prāna&rsquo;. Other synonymous words are &lsquo;prāṇasainyama&rsquo; (note 2310) and &lsquo;pripagarrodha&rsquo;. The important point is: What does &lsquo;Prāpa&rsquo; mean bere, The word is derived from the root &lsquo;an&rsquo;(to breathe) with the prefix &lsquo;pra&rsquo;. The verb and its forms occur in the Rgveda as in I. 101.5, X. 121. 3, X. 125.4. In various passages of the Rg. prāṇa means simply &lsquo;breath&rsquo; (as in I. 66. 1, III. 53.21, X. 69. 6. In Rg. X. 90, 13 (prāṇād-vāyur-ajāyata) it is stated that Vāyu (air, wind) arose from the prāṇa of the primaval purusa. The word asu&rsquo; also is used in the Rgveda in the sense of prāna&rsquo; in I. 113. 16 ( udhirdhyam jivo asur-na agāt), I. 164. 4. We have both prūnanu (breath ) and jivana (life) in Rg. I. 48. 10 (addressed to Usas). Perhaps apāna is suggested in Rg. X 189, 2 (antaścarati rocanāsya prādād-apāṇati). Al the five</p>

<p>Vedic reference to five prānas</p>
<p>1435</p>
<p>names of prāṇas appear in pairs as in the note 2353 below from Tāi. 8. In the Tai. 8. I, 7.9.2 occur the three words &lsquo;prāṇa, apāna and vyāna&rsquo;. The Atharvayeda (in VIII, 1. 1) mentions * prāṇāḥ&rsquo; and &lsquo;apānāḥ&rsquo; in the plural and asu&rsquo;, &lsquo;prāṇa&rsquo; and *ayuḥ&rsquo; in VIII. 1.3, all probably meaning &lsquo;life&rsquo;. In the Upaniṣads, prāna becomes the vital force or principle of all beings, the representative or symbol of brahma; vide Bș. Up. I. 6.3 (Prāṇo vā amrtam, nāmarūpe satyam, tābhyām-ayam prāṇaśchannah), Bṛ. Up. L5. 23, which, after quoting a verse that the sun rises from Prāṇa and sets in Prāṇa, goes on to say (tasmādekam-eva vratam carot, prāṇyāc-caiva-apānyacca, non-mā fāpmā pityur-āpnavad-iti) &lsquo;therefore one must observe only one vow, he should inhale and exhale with the (fearful) thought that otherwise, the Evil one, Death, might seize me&rsquo;. Here it appears that we have the germ of the theory of the importance of prāṇāyāma. In Chan, Up. V. 18-24 it is stated that the five āhutis are offered to prāṇa, vyāna, apāna, samāna and udāna (in the words &lsquo;Prānāya syābā&rsquo; &amp;c.) at the time of a meal and that one who knows the true meaning of Agnihotra and offerings offers it in all worlds, in all beings and in all selves. Even now these āhutis are takan before meals by brāhmaṇas, only the order of the five differs. Praśna II, 13 says:– All this that is established in the three worlds is under the dominance of Prāṇa.' In Chān. Up. IV. 3. 3 Prāna is again given five bames on account of its working in the different parts of the human body viz. prāṇa, apāna, vyāna, samāna and udāna (all five being named in the Tai. S.). It follows that some distinction among. the operation of the five prāṇas must have been made at least a thousand years before the Christian era.</p>

<p>History of Dharmaśāstra (Sea VIII, Oh, XXXII</p>
<p>In this work it is not necessary to enter upon an exbaustive discussion on prāna from the Upaniṣads. A controversy has gone on about the meaning of prāna and apāng. Caland, Keith, Dumont and a few others hold that &lsquo;prāṇa&rsquo; means in the anoient Vedic literature expiration&rsquo; and &lsquo;apāna&rsquo; means &lsquo;inspiration&rsquo;, but that this meaning was revised in later days. On the other hand almost all Sanskrit commentators and writers and G. W. Brown, Edgerton and others hold the opposite view.2351 The present author agrees with the latter view viz. that &lsquo;prāṇa&rsquo; meant and means inbalation or thoracic breath', while &lsquo;apāna&rsquo; means &lsquo;abdominal breath. All scholars are agreed that those are certainly the meanings of the words prāna and apana in all classical Sanskrit literature, the opposite view being confined to the ancient period even by those who hold that prāṇa and apāna meant respectively &ldquo;expiration&rsquo; and &lsquo;inspiration&rsquo;. We should as far as possible so construe all Upaniṣad passages as to yield the same sense consistently. The Praśna Up. (certainly an early Upaniṣad, though not among the earliest ones) contains the following interesting and rather decisive passage &ldquo;just as the king appoints his officers saying &lsquo;(each of) you should govern such and such villages&rsquo;, in the same way this prāṇa assigns to the other prānas separate spheres viz. apāna in the organs of excrement and generation, the prāṇa going in from the mouth and nose establishes himself (as king) in the eyes and ears, Samāna in the middle (of the spheres of Prāna and Apāna) i. e, in the navel, since it is he (Samāna) that carries the food offered (in the fire i, e, in the stomach) equally (to all bodily parts ).&rdquo;</p>
<p>Caland, Dumont and others who hold that the word &lsquo;prāṇa&rsquo; in ancient Sanskrit literature means &lsquo;expiration&rsquo;, chiefly rely on Saṅkarācārya&rsquo;s explanation of Chāp.2355 Up. I. 3. 3. (yadvai</p>

Up I. 3.3) only mean &lsquo;inhaling&rsquo;; but that expression is capable of mean ing &lsquo;it draws the air into the inside of the body (i. e, in the abdomen) and what is more important, one has to note that the interpretation put on Saṅkara&rsquo;s words here by Caland, Dumont and others is directly opposed to Saṅkarācārya&rsquo;s own explana tions in several other passages of the Upaniṣads, such as Bļ. Up. I. 5. 3, III, 4. 1, Chan. Up. III, 13, 1-6, Katha 5. 3; Praśna III, 4-5 (vide note 2353). The bhāṣya on Bṛ. Up. I. 5.3 2356 remarks &ldquo;Prāpa is an activity of the heart which moves about in the mouth and nose and is so called because it is led forth ; Apāna is a downward movement starting from the navel and is 80 called because it oasts out urine and excreta&rsquo;. On Praśna Up. 111. 4 (quoted in n. 2353) the Saṅkarabhāṣya says the same thing about Prāpa and Apāna. Not only Saṅkarācārya but a much earlier authority viz. the Dharmasūtra of Devala (mentioned by Saṅkara, vide p. 1352 n. 2208 above) defines the working of Prāṇa and Apāna as done by Saṅkarācārya in his bhāṣya on Br. Up. I.5.3.</p>
<p>In the Yoga system (which is based on the Upaniṣads ) prāṇa implies more than mere breath. It means vital energy, powers such as speech, eye, ear, manas in the body as well as in different forms in the universe. Its most perceptible manifestation in the human body is the movement of the lungs. The Y. S. inculcates on the yogic student the doctrine that by scientific control ( as laid down in it) of prāṇa in the body it is possible to obtain control over the deep-seated (and ordinarily imperceptible ) forces in human consciousness as well as in the external world.</p>

<p>History of Dharmaśāstra (Soc. VIII, Ch. XXXI</p>
<p>The word &lsquo;pranayama &lsquo;does not occur in any of the principal Upaniṣads.7357 But it occurs frequently in the Sūtras. For example, the Ap. Dh. S. provides that if a householder 2355 is still asleep when the sun rises be should fast and keep silent that day (till night) and observes that, according to some ācāryas, he should continue to porform prāniyāma till he feels exhausted (by way of penance). The Gaut. Dh. S, states that if animals other than dogs, snakes, frogs and cata pass between the teacher and the pupil when the latter has sat down bofore the former for study, he ( pupil) should practise three prāniyāmas and should partake of some clarified butter (hy way of prāyaścitta). Similarly, it provides that if a person smells the odour from the mouth of one that has drunk liquor, he should perform ( 88 penance) three prāṇāyamas and should partake of clarified butter and that if a Vedic student chances to see an impure person like a Candāla, he should, after performing one Prāṇāyāma, look at the sun. Similarly, Baud. Dh. S. (IV.1.4-11, prose) provides prānāyāmas as expiation for gereral lapsos.</p>
<p>The above examples show that in the times of the Sūtras (i, e. several centuries before the Christian era) the conception of prāpāyāma had been so doveloped as to hold that it was a sort of penance and religious rite for removing the taint attaching to acts and omissions that wore condemned by the then society. At this stage prāpāyāma appears merely to have been a religious act independent of any theory about its being one of the eight angas of yoga.</p>
<p>To the five prānas mentioned in Vedic literature, the Purāṇas and other medieval works added five more prāpas with different 2359 names.</p>

<p>Prūnāyāına ex pluined in yoga-sutra</p>
<p>1437</p>
<p>It is now proper to see how the Y, S, defines and explains prāṇāyama. &lsquo;When the stability of posture has been assured (or secured) prāṇāyāma is the pause (lit. cutting off) in the movements of inhalation and exhalation&rsquo;. The bhāṣya explaing * śvāss&rsquo; as drawing in of the air which is outside one&rsquo;s body&rsquo; and &lsquo;praśyāsa&rsquo; as the expelling of the air in the trunk (or chest)&rsquo; and the absence of both these is prāṇāyāma. This shows that the chief element in prāṇāyāma is the absence of both inhalation and exhalation i. e, kumbhaka in the technical language of yoga works. The next gūtra states that prāṇāyāma (the pause in movement) is of three kinds, viz. external, internal and suppressed. The idea is that Kumbhaka (stopping or pause) may be done after one has taken in air from outside (first kind) or after one has expelled air from the trunk (2nd kind) or when one is in a normal condition (i. e. neitber making an effort to fill his chest with air or emptying it of air) one may make a pause ( 3rd kind). Each of these may be regulated and considered from the point of the units of space, time (measurement by kalās or mātrūs) and numbers. Prāṇāyāma is called mṛdu (mild) when pause is kept up for 36 mātrās, then moderate one when kopt up for 72 mātrās and keen (tivra) when kept up for 108 matrās. When practised for days, fortnights and months, it is called protracted and when performed with great skill it is called sūkṣma (subtle ).</p>
<p>In connection with prāṇāyāma we must look to Y. S. I. 34 also. That sūtra lays down that for securing the undisturbed calm of the mind one remedy is the expulsion and retention of the breath, 2360 It appears from that sūtra and its bhāṣya that vidhārana (retention of breath, I. e. Kumbhaka) is prāṇāyāma.</p>
<p>Some explanation must be offered about desa (space), kāla and sankhya in relation to prāṇāyāma. Ordinarily a healthy grown-up man breathes in and out in about four seconds i, e. about 15 times a minute ( 21600 times in one day and night). In order to measure the force of the recaka a piece of cotton or : a thin thread is held at some distance from the nostrils and the . distance up to which the air driven from the nostrils makes the cotton or thread move or cease to move is measured by means of finger-breadths. As regards time several units of time are mentioned because in those ancient days there was no scientific</p>

<p>apparatus. The time taken for winking (niment) is equal 2161 to the time required for pronouncing &amp; short vowel and this was called mulrū. The time taken for touching one&rsquo;s kneos thrice with one&rsquo;s hand and snapping the thumb and forefinger was also called mnātrā. Other units are passed over. The general rules are that both recuka and pīraka must be uniform and quiet, that the time given for pūraka should be half of that given to recaka. Three views about the duration of pūraka, kumbhaka and recaka are that they should be in the proportion of 1:4:2 or 1:2:2 or the same for all. The Puriṇas give different nātrās for prapāyāmas e. g. the Mārkaṇdeya (36. 13, 14 ) says that the laghu (mrdu of the bhāsya) is of twelve mātrās, double of that ia madhyama and the uttariya (tivra in the bhāsya) is for three times twelve mātrās, while the Garudapurāṇa (I. 226. 14-15) puts down the figures as 10, 20, 30 respectively and the Kūrma purāṇa ( II. 11. 32) agrees with the Mārkapdeya. The Mitakṣara on Yāj. III. 200-201 provides that prāṇāyāma is of three varieties (adhama of 15 mātrās, madhyama of 30 mātrās and uttama of 45 mātrās). The Lingapurāṇa (I. 8. 47-48) also puts forth 12, 24, 36 mātrās as the time of nici unghała, madhyama udghāta and mukhya and states that obvious results of these three are respectively perspiration, treinor and utthāna (prasāda-kampa. notthāna-janakaśca yathākramam). Compare Mārk, 36. 16 which states that those three are to be mastered respectively by the different lengths of prāṇāyāma (prathamena jayet svedam madhyamena ca repathuma / viṇādam hi tftiyena jayed-doṣan anukramāt 11).</p>

A third matter to be considered is that in some later works rocaka, pūraka and kumbhaka are said to be three prāṇāyāmas and this latter is said to be of four kinds, three set out in Y. S.

<p>Saṅkarācārya (vide note 2208 above). The Bphad-Yogi-Yaj, and Vacaspati also mention them. The Viṣnupurāṇa in a poetic description of the Sarad season employs them by way of śleṣa 2364 ( as below). Several modes of performing prāṣāyāma are prescribed. One of the simplest is to stop the right nostril with the thumb, to fill in air through the left nostril according to one&rsquo;s ability; then to throw out the air through the right nostril; again inhale through the right nostril and ejact air through the left. Do this at least thrice. Practise this at least twice every day, preferably in the morning after bath and in the evening or four times ( before dawn, during midday, in the evening or at midnight). In the beginning kumbhaka need not be practised at all. After some practice with pūraka and recaka, kumbbaka may be begun after recaka. Kumbhaka after pūraka is to be practised with great caution and should be attempted under the direction of an expert.</p>

I he Y. 8. states that from the practice of prāṇāyāma results the dwindling of actions (or kleśas) that envelop enlightenment (which is the characteristic of saltva) and the</p>

<p>Benefits from āsana, prānāyāma &amp;c.</p>
<p>1441</p>
<p>mind of the yogin becomes fit for fixed attention. 2866 The Gorakṣaśataka 2367 provides &lsquo;a yogin always eradicates diseases by Zsana, sin by prānāyāma and mental disturbance by pratyāhāra&rsquo;. The Smrtis state that prāṣāyāmas have great efficacy in destroying sins. Madu XI. 248 ( =Vasiṣtha 26, 4, Baud. Dh. 8. IV, 1, 31 and Saṅkbasmrti XII. 18-19) states</p>
<p>sixteen prāṇāyāmas performed everyday for a month together with the vāhrtis and pranava (om) purify even the murderer of a brāhmaṇa. Manu XI. 199 and 201 prescribe the performance of a single prāṇāyāma as a purification for light lapses or riding an ass or a camel and such incidents as being bitten by a dog, jackal, horse, camel, boar or man. Yaj. III. 305 prescribes the performance of a hundred prāṇāyāmas for the destruction of all sins, of upapatakas (lesser sing described in Yāj. III. 234–242) and of sins for which no specific prāyascitta is provided. Manu II. 83 (=Vasistha X, 5 and Visnudharmasūtra 55.83) states the one syllable (om ) is (the representative of) the highest brahma and prāṇāyāmas are the highest tapas&rsquo;.</p>
<p>It may interest readers to note that the great Jaina monk, ācārya Homacandra, condemns prāṇāyāmas by saying that they allow no rest to the mind, that there is physical effort in pūraka, kumbhaka and recaka and that prānāyāma is an obstacle to mukti. 2368</p>
<p>In kumbhaka performed after pūraka the nerves, heart and lungs are under strain and permanent damage to these may result from careless or basty practice of kumbhaka after pūraka. Those suffering from lung or cardiac affections should not enter upon the practice of prāṇāyāma on their own initiative but must first consult an expert. Swami Vivekananda said long ago that all students of Yoga 2369 are expressly and earnestly reminded</p>

<p>that with few exceptions Yoga can safely be learnt by direct contact with a teacher&rsquo;. The fact, that the Yogasūtra oon. taining 195 sūtras in all devotes only five sūtras (II. 49-53 ) to prāṇāyāma and that even these five are of a very general Dature, indicates that Patarijali intended that the yogio should not practise prāṇāyāma by merely listening to or reading those gūtras but should approach an expert yogin for instruction and guidance.</p>
<p>It should be noticed that Patañjali does not require in his definition of prāṇāyāma the mental or inaudible repetition of any syllable like &lsquo;om&rsquo; or any mantra like the Gayatrı. But the Smṛtis prescribe the practice of prāṇāyame every day in the Sandhyāvandada. Yāj. (I. 22 ) proscribes 2370 that a man of the three higher varnas must every day take a bath, perform mārjana (sprinkling water with kuśas) with the mantras (Rg. X. 9. 1-3 &lsquo;apo hi ṣthā &amp;c.'), practise prāṇāyāma, worship of the sun and japa of Gayatri (Rg. III. 62. 10) and that prāṇāyāma comprises the japa three times of Gayatri preceded by the Vyābstis, each being preceded by Om and followed by the firas. Prāṇāyāma as described by Yāj. is prescribed even in modern times for the morning and evening Sandbyā adorations. Prāṇā yama with mental repetition of &lsquo;Om&rsquo; or a.mantra&rsquo; is oalled &lsquo;sagarbha&rsquo; 2171 or &lsquo;sabija,&rsquo; while prāṇāyāma not so accompanied</p>

<p>is called &lsquo;agarbha&rsquo; or &lsquo;abija&rsquo; and it is said that &ldquo;sagarbha&rsquo; is the better of the two. Śāntiparva (304. 9. or. ed.=Ch. ed. 316.9-10) speaks of saguṇa and nirgupa prāṇāyāma. The Yogabhāsy &amp; (on Y. 8. II, 52 ) quotes a passage 2372 6 there is no higher tapas than prāṇāyāma, therefrom arises purification of the taints and knowledge flashes forth.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The H. Y.P. speaks of eight kinds of Prāṇāyāma (in II. 44). The two most important ones, viz Ujjāyi and Bhastrikā are described by Sri Kuvalayananda in chap. IV. pp. 67-68 and chap. VI. pp. 101-115 respectively in his handbook on Prāṇā yāma, part one and the other six viz. Sūryabhedana, Sitkāri, Sitali, Bhramari, Mūrochā, Plāvini in. pp. 6–25 of the handbook part 2. H. Y.P. (II. 48-70) describes all the eight at some length</p>
<p>Dr. Role in his work &lsquo;Mysterious Kundalini&rsquo; provides at the very beginning &amp; diagram of the autonomic nervous system according to the Western anatomical science, showing the six oakres and identifying the positions of those six and the sahasraracakra (lit. thousand-petalled i. e. having pumberless petals). He propounded an original view that the Kundalini is the right vagus nerve. His book is very interesting and he has explored a very large field of yogic practices. He has very thoroughly utilized his deep knowledge of Western anatomy and physiology, but he himself admits in his preface (p. 2) that the explanations of the various Yogio practices and phenomena given by him are possible suggestions only. But it may be noted that Sir John Woodroffe, who made a deep study of Yoga and of Tantra works and who wrote a foreword to Dr. Rele&rsquo;s work, was not prepared to accept Dr. Role&rsquo;s identification of Kundalini with the right Vagus Nerve (p. ii) and holds that Kundalint is not a nerve or any other physical substance or mental faculty but rather the Ground Substance of both (Forge word p. iii). Similarly, Shri Kuvalayanand (in his popular handbook on prāpāyāma part 1, p. 57 n. 3), after referring to Dr. Rele&rsquo;s admission about his explanations being possible sugges tions only, points out that Dr. Rele had not tried a single experi ment in the laboratory nor had be taken much oare to consult the practical experience of the students of Yoga and he states that to him the whole book of Dr. Role seems to be of doubtful scientific value. He goes further and apports that Swami</p>

Sri Kuvalayanand shows (on pp. 121-126 ) the value of pripāyāma for physical health and the proper functioning of the lungs, the organs of digestion, the liver, pancreas and kidneys and asserts that the spiritual value of Prāṇāyāma is very great.</p>
<p>Pratyahāra (withdrawal of the sonse orgads from the objects of senso ) is defined 2373 in Y. S. II, 54 as &lsquo;when the senses have no contact with (are withdrawn from) their objecte (because the mind is restrained) and thereby resemble the state of the mind itself, there is pratyāhāra.&rsquo; When the mind, being restrained by the yogin, does not come in contact with the objects of senge, viz, sound, touch, form, taste, smell, the organs of songe also become disconnected with them, the organs come to resemble the mind itself (hence the words anukāra iva&rsquo; in the sutra). From this (non-contact) results the complete mastery over the senses, The idea is that in restraining the mind from the objects of sense the organs also are withdrawn from contact with them. Since the mind is made ekāgra (one-pointed) the sense organs together with the mind do not cognise or apprehend the objects. Pratyāhāra is the checking of the outgoing activities of the mind and freeing it from being the slave of the senses. The Sāntiparva (cr. ed. 188. 5-7 = Ch. ed. 195. 6-7) speaks of it. The Vigpupurāṇa in V. 10. 14 (in describing Sarad, i.e. autumn, states &lsquo;Sarad removed the turbidness of waters as pratyāhāra withdraws the organs from their objects&rsquo;) refers to pratyāhāra 2374</p>

<p>Pratyahāra explained</p>
<p>1445</p>
<p>as Indriyanindriyarthebhyaḥ pratyahāra ivāharat&rsquo;.| Vacaspati quotes two verses from the Viṣnupurāna which employ the very characteristic words of the Y. S. and probably borrow the idea and language from the Y. 8. The Dharmasūtra of Dovala 2375 explains pratyahāra as establisbing (or yoking) the mind to the soul by bringing it back (to the soul) when it has swerved from the path of Yoga, because of its subtlety, its restlessness, its thoughtlessness or its force&rsquo;. The Kūrmapurāṇa 2076 defines it as &lsquo;the suppression or mastery over the organs of sense that are naturally attracted to objects of sense&rsquo;. Vide Sāntiparva (07. ed. 232. 13 ) also.</p>
<p>It appears that when the Chan. Up. (in VIII. 15) opumeratos the circumstances which enable a person to reach the worlds of brahmu it has an idea of pratyābāra in the word &lsquo;atmani sarvendriyāṇi sampratisthāpya&rsquo; (* when he concentrates all his senses in the self&rsquo;).</p>
<p>The third pāda of the Y. 8. is called &lsquo;Vibhati-pāda&rsquo; (pada that deals with the super-pormal powers of the yogin), The word &lsquo;vibhūti&rsquo; occurs in Praspa 5, 4 where it is stated that he who contemplates on Om of the dvimātra type is taken to the world of the moon where he enjoys &lsquo;vibhāti&rsquo; and again returns to the earth. There the word probably means nothing more than prosperous life. The third pada first deals with the last three of the sight angas of Yoga, the first five being called bahiranga (indirect helpers of samprajñātajamādbi), while the last thras are said to be antaranga of samprajñāta-samadhi (but even these three are bahiranga with reference to pirblia Yoga, og be latter may occur oven in the absence of the three dhāraña' &amp;c. These three are called dharapā, dhyāna and samadhi and these three when practised on the game object are called sarnyama, which is a technical term in the Yoga system. Vibhūtis are the results of samyama of various kinds. Instead of employing the three words dhāraṇa, dhyana and samadhi Patanjali explogs expressly or implied, the word gamyama' in most of the sāttas from 16 to 52 of the 3rd pāda.</p>

<p>History of Dharmatūstra 1880. VIII, Ch. XXXII</p>
<p>Dhāraṇā, dhyāna and samadhi are said to be the direct auxiliaries of Yoga and are three successive stages, the preceding one leading to the next. Dhārapā is the holding of the mind to a certain spot or point 2377 or object. The bhāṣya explains that the mind is to be held down to such spots (in one&rsquo;s body) as the navel, the heart-lotus, the head, the light (in the eye), the tip of the nose, the tip of the tongue and the like or on external objects (such as images of gods in various forms). In this stage attention has to be firmly held upon the choson object for a period of timo determined by the will of the yoga aspirant. In this stage there are three elements, the subject, the objoot and the act of concentration. The next stage is dhyāna, which will be described immediately below. The Mārkandeya Purāṇa speaks of ton dhāraṇās on the different parts of the yogin&rsquo;s own body 3378 and is in accordance with the plural &lsquo;dhāraṇāsu ca yogyata manasah&rsquo; (in Y. S. II. 53) employed by Patanjali himself. The Asvamedhikaparva also employs the plural &lsquo;dharanasu&rsquo;. Vide the Santiparva (er. ed. 188.8-12 %D Ch. ed. 195.8).

Dovala states 2380 that dhārapa is the holding in check of the body, senses, mind, intellect and Ātman (egoism).</p>

As one of the curiosities of history and further as a lesson in humility we must point out that the states just described under the names of collectedness, contention and auto hypnosis are described with considerable psychological acumen (though not in modern psychological terminology) in the precepts by which for centuries past the Yogis of Hindustan have been accustomed to attain to self-mastery and the author refers to Pratyāhāra and Dhāraṇā in this connection and on p. 151 remarks that auto-hypnosis is encountered in Yoga but it is tinged with mysticism because the sacred word &lsquo;om&rsquo; is repeated hundreds of times.</p>

This shows that dhyāna is either saguna or nirguna as stated by the Padmapurana IV.84, 80-86 (pirguna) and IV. 84. 88-96 ( saguna) or sūkāra and nirākūra (Padmapurāṇa, II, 80.70, 77-78). The Vispoparāṇa (VI. 7. 78-90) contains a passage similar to the Viṣnu Dh. S. Skanda (Kāśikhanda, chap. 41. 19) speaks of dhyāna as saguna and nirguna and defines saguna as depending on different forms or as accompanied by repetition of mantras and nirgupa as not depending on any particular form or as not accompanied by mantras&rsquo;. The Narasimhapurāṇa (17. 11-28 and 26. 17) describes at some length the form in which Nārāyaṇa or Visnu is to be contemplated upon and these verses are quoted by the Krtya kalpataru (Mokṣa, pp. 191-192). The Saṅkha-smrti states that one has realization (darśana) of the Lord of gods that abides in the heart (of every person) by means of dhyānayoga and describes the mode of dhyāna. Dakṣasmrti also emphasizes dhyāna and jñāna (correct knowledge) and states that descrip tion of others serves no purpose beyond adding to the bulk of the workIn this stage there is only the duality of subject and object, there is no awareness of effort to tie down the mind on an object ( as in mere dhāraṇā ).</p>

<p>History of Dharmatustra [800. VITI, Ch. XXXII</p>
<p>meditation is carried to &amp; stage where the object contemplated upon alone appears and the meditator is not consolous of the idea of contemplation, because the object meditated upon entirely engulfs the meditator. The yogin becomes so much identified with the object meditated upon that he is not conscious that he is contemplating upon an object. This is what is meant by &lsquo;svarupasunyam-iva&rsquo; (in Y. S. III. 3). In Samadhi the subject and object, the individual and Paramātman are completely blended into one, so that the consciousness of the subject as separate from object disappears. The word &lsquo;Samadhi&rsquo; does not occur in any of the ancient Upanigads, though it is known to the Maitrayani Up. (vide n. 2327 above). The word Samadhi occurs in the Bhagavadgita (II. 53-54) and in Vanaparva (3. 11) and in Santiparva 195. 19-20, Cb. ed.). The Visnu. purapa2384 provides that it is called Samadhi when the mind grasps as a result of dhyāna the real nature of that (the Paramātman) in which there is absence of the separate apprehension (of the object to be meditated upon, the act of meditation and the meditator). The three (dhāraṇā, dhyāna and samadhi) are direct aids in samprajñāta-samadhi but they are indirect aids in asamprajñātasamādbi, as this last may follow without these. The Hathayoga-pradipika 2385 states that is called Samadhi where there is equality and oneness of the individual self and the Highest Self and where all desires cease to exist&rsquo;. Sabija and nirbija samadhis would be equal to savikalpa and nirvikalpa samādhi defined by the Vedantasāra. There are soveral grades or stages in samadhi. There are four grades 2385 of Samprajnata</p>

<p>Four kinds of samadhi</p>
<p>1451</p>
<p>samadhi, viz. Bavitarka, pirritarka, savicāra, nirvloāra. Vide p. 1411 note 2318 above. The word gauḥ, the object cow denoted by it and the oonoopt or idea ( jõāna) &lsquo;this is a cow&rsquo; are all really three separate matters, but they are apprehended as mixed up. When a yogin concentrates upon a gross object and his intellect is conscious of that object 28 permeated by all the above three, then that samadhi is savitarka (Y. S. I, 42). For the others vide note 2318 and below. In the asamprajñāta Samādhi, the ultimate reality dawas on the yogin, praksti does not affect him in any way, his soul which abides in itself and is not conscious of personality and even of joy is all cit or citeakti and nothing else. In this section about the influence of yoga on Dharmaśāstra it is not necessary to go deeply into the several stages of samadhi described in the yoga works. The Gorakṣaśataka 2387 describes the final stage of samadhi as follows: &lsquo;A yogin in Samadhi does not apprehend smell, flavour, form, touch or sound nor does he apprehend him self or others ( as distinct); kaowers of brahma hold it to be pure, immovable, eternal, not engaged in activities, free from the guṇas, expansive like the sky, as intelligence and bliss; the knower of yoga teaches non-duality in the highest stage as milk poured in milk, ghee into ghee or fire into fire.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It would have been noted that in dharānā, dhyāna and samadhi the principal emphasis is mental. External conditions do help in the training but they are subsidiary. As noted above (pp. 1421–22 ) cleanliness, contentment, austerities (tapas), sexual purity, certain easy postures and living in detachment, restrictions as to quantity and quality of food-these are the chief physical or external conditions. While the yogin practises the above three he may develop certain super-Dormal powers which he is advised to ignore, as they are hindrances in the attainment of his goal ( Yogasūtra III. 36). Though this is the opinion of Patanjali, from the fact that with most yogins the siddhis are an important part of yoga doctrines and the fact that, out of 195 sūtras of the Yogasutra, 35 (III. 16-59) are devoted</p>

<p>to the description of siddhis, the present author is constrained to gay that siddhis are an integral part of Yoga. The Vaikhānasa. smārtasutra says that the yogin can vanish from people, can 800 distant objects and hear in spite of great distance.</p>
<p>It is unnecessary to dwell upon the results of all santyamas mentioned in Y. S. pāda three. A few are cited by way of sample. By saiyama on the power of an elephant one socures the strength of an elephant (111. 24), by samyama on the sun there arises the knowledge of the soven worlds (11I. 26 ) and by samyama on the moon, there arises knowledge of the arrange ment of the stars (III. 27), by samyama on the navel cakra arises knowledge of the arrangement of the body (III. 29, viz. the three doṣcze, rāta, pilla, kapha and the seven dhātus viz. skin, blood, flesh, sinews, bones, marrow and somen). By samyama on the coarse 2388 forms, the essential attributes (svarūpa), the subtle form (tanmātrās), the inherence (anvaya) and the pur. posiveness of the five elements results the conquest (or mastery over) elements and from this results the appearance of the per fections called anıma and others, perfection of body and non obstruction (of the actions of the yogin by the qualities of the elements i. e, the earth cannot prevent the yogin by its hardness from penetrating inside the earth&rsquo;s rocks nor can fire burn him &amp;c.). In IV. 1 Patañjali states that supernormal powers (siddhis) arise in five ways viz. by birth in certain 2389 bodies</p>

<p>History of Dharmaśāstra (Soc. VIII, Ch. XXXII</p>
<p>a great sage and its power of suggestion is great. But the real effective power of a mantra seems to the present au thor to depend far more on the knowledge, the responsiveness and the high spiritual level which the person who repeats it brings to bear on its use. No scientific tests have been employed and different works emphasize with exaggeration one of the two theories about mantras. All is speculation. The present author believes that the 2nd theory has greater elements of trust-worthi ness than the first, as it relies on human psychology, while the first degenerated so much that the famous mantrus &lsquo;om mapi padne hūm&rsquo; (dedicated to Avalokitesvara) written on some material and pasted on a whoel which was turned round and round hundreds of times was supposed to yield great results, The 2nd theory led to the importance of guru and dikṣā (initiation) and here also extravagant claims were made. This latter theory, however, required that the disciple should possess certain qualifications such as implicit faith in the guru, respect for matters spiritual, some knowledge of the tenets and the basio scriptures and readiness to devote time and energy to the study and practice of the teachings of the guru. Vide Siva-samhita (III. 10-19 ) for the relation between guru and disciple.</p>
<p>The fourth pūda deals with Kairalya. The yogin who has gone through the whole discipline up to samadhi and has become thoroughly aware of the distinction between Puruṣa and the guṇas ( sattva and others), becomes free from the influence of the three guṇas, because they merge in Pradhāna after having served the purpose of the soul, that is Kaivalya (isolation) or it (Kaivalya) may be stated to be the principle of consciousness that abides by itself (and does not become connected with even sa!tru-guna). 2391 This has also been alluded to in Y. S. II, 25 that states that when aridyā (nescience) is removed by discri mination the self (who is the perceiver) does not come into contact with the guṇas, which state is Kaivalya, 2392 Kaivalya</p>

<p>is put forword in IV. 34 from two points of view. When a puruṣa ceases to be affected in any way by the guṇas (that constitute prakrti) because he has become entirely passionless, praksti becomes aloof ( kevala) so far as that purusa is concerned. When puruṣa has thorough knowledge and ceases to be affected by guṇas he remains as bare consciousness (citisakti) and remains aloof (kovala ) and that is the 2nd point of view about kaivalya. In that state of kaivalya or mokṣa we cannot predicate any happiness or bliss about him but we can only gay about him that he is in a state of bare consciousness (citisakti&hellip; The Upaniṣads declare 239 that in such a state the liberated soul has neither joy nor sorrow, that happiness or its opposite does not touch such an one, since he has risen above identifying the body with himself. The ideal of Yoga is to be jIvan-mukta (i. e. to reject Life and Personality, to die to this world though the body may persist for some time ).</p>

I am convinced that the Yogasūtras of Patañjali do really contain the information 238 that some of the most advanced psychotherapists of the present day are ardently seeking &lsquo;(p. 245).</p>

<p>History of Dharmaśāstra (Sec. VIII, Ch. XXXII</p>
<p>The last chapter in Dr. Behanan&rsquo;s book on &lsquo;Yoga, a scientific evaluation&rsquo; is interesting and important. He makes an appraisal of several aspects of Yoga by means of experiments which he carried out on himself after spending one year under the guidance of Swami Kuvalayanand of Lonavla and after he had three years of experience in Yogic breathing. It is not possible for reasons of space to give here a summary of his appraisal of several aspects of Yoga but reference may be made to a fow of his findings. He finds that by yogic practices the mind is turned joward and detached from the external world (p. 232), it seems to him very probable that the prāṇāyāmic breathing induces a state of relaxation, thereby inducing the mind to take an inward course (p. 234 ), that taking normal breathing as a basis of comparison it was found that oxygen consumption increased 24,5 per cent in Ujjāyi, 18. 5 per cent in Vlistrikū and 12 per cont in Kapālabhāti; that the nasal gaze in &amp; meditative posture is an aid to checking the wandering propensities of the mind (p. 242), that Yogic practices lead to an emotional stability and that watching at close range for a year the daily lives of more than half a dozen practitioners of yoga Dr. Behanan concluded that they were the happiest personalities that he had known and that their serenity was contagious (p. 245).</p>
<p>Dr. P. A. Sorokin of the Harvard University, one of the greatest living sociologists, contributes a very valuable paper on &ldquo;Yoga and man&rsquo;s transfiguration to the Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan&rsquo;s Journal for November 1958 (pp. 111-120), the very first sentence of which opens with tha words &lsquo;The methods and techniques of the yoga, particularly those of the Rājayoga, contain in themselves nearly all the sound techniques of modern psycho-analysis, psychotherapy, psycho-drama, moral education, and education of character.&rsquo;</p>
<p>That a person engaged in Yoga practices is succeeding in reaching higher and higher spiritual lovels is shown by the appearance of certain traits in himself. The Sv. Up, states that the first favourable signs of the working of Yoga are: lightness Or agility of body, health, freedom from desires, brightness of complexion, fineness of voice, pleasant bodily odour, passing only a small quantity of urine or excreta. Almost the same Verse occurs in the Vayu 2394 and the Mārkandeya Puranas and</p>

<p>Mārkandeya further says &lsquo;people come to like the yogin and sing praises of his qualities behind his back and all animals are not afraid of him; he is not affected by severe cold or heat and is not afraid of others; these show that siddhi in Yoga is approaching.&rsquo; The Vāyupurāna adds &ldquo;if the practitioner of Yoga sees the earth or his body as if on fire and if he sees him self entering the elements (or all beings) he should understand that suocess in Yoga is near.&rsquo; 23</p>
<p>The Mārkandeya-purāṇa (chap. 38 Ferse 26 ) and the Viṣnu purāṇa II. 13 describe at some length yogicarya (ia behaviour or conduct of a yogin). It is not possible to get out all that is said in these chapters but two striking Ferses are rendered here The Mārkandeya 239 says honour and disrespect cause pleasure and distress to man (in general), but these two bave the reverse effect and serve to produce perfection in the yogin; these two are called poison and nectar respectively; disrespect is nectar for the yogin and honour is terrible poison.&rsquo; The Visnupurāns emphasizes that a yogin should so act that people will disrespect him and would not seek his company. The Manusiniti (in</p>
<p>VI. 38-85) enlarges upon the duties of sannyāsins, many of which are applicable to yogins. In VI, 65 Manu calls upon the sannyāsin to ponder by means of Yoga over the subtlaneas of the Highest Self and in VI, 73 Many advises the ascetic to practise dhyanayoga. The Yājñavalkyasmiti ako (in III. 56-67) prescribes the duties of sannyāsins, one of which (in Verse 64) is the same as Manu VI. 73,</p>

The wise call a man yukta (a yogin), when he neither hears, nor smells fragrance, nor tastes nor sees, nor touches and when his mind does not form (ever changing ) ideas, when he does not regard anything as his own, when he does not cognise ( external objects) as if he were a log of wood and when he can be said to have recovered the original real nature (of the Self). The Devaladharmasūtra provides that all beings come under bondage owing to alankārn (egoism that one will do this or that) and maiatza (regarding transiont things as owned by oneself) but he who is free from these becomes liberated. 2398</p>
<p>Through centuries Sannyasins and Yogins have been paid the highest honours in India. Special emphasis is laid on inviting a Yogin at a śrāddha and it is said by some authorities that a single yogin is equal to hundreds and thousands of brāhmaṇas. Vide H. of Da. Vol. IV. pp. 388, 398-399 for original authorities. In cases of doubt as to what the proper conduct or Dharma is in a set of circumstances, the matter was loft to be decided by E pariṣid (an assembly ) of ten learned brābmaṇas or at least three, but even one may constitute a pariṣad, provided he is learned in Veda and knows Dharma (vide Manu XII, 108–113). But Yaj. I. 9 and others say that four persons knowing the Veda and Dharmaśāstra or three of the same type or even one who is the best among knowers of spiritual matters (ascetics) may constitute a pariṣad and what he declares would be the right course of conduct. Vide H. of Dh. VOL. II. 969 for texts on this point, The Bhagavad-gitā says &lsquo;the yogin (who is a real karmayogin surrendering the</p>

<p>Manu (XII, 83) states &lsquo;study of the Veda, tapas, true knowledge (about brahma), restraint of the sense organs, ahiñsā, attending on one&rsquo;s guru-these are the highest means of nihśreyasa (i.e. mokṣa). Then verge 85 proceeds of all these six means true knowledge of the Self is the highest, it is at the head of all vidyās (lores), since immortality (mokṣa) is obtained by means of it.</p>
<p>The highest value is attached to Yoga 2399 as an integral part of Vedanta by the Yājñavalkyasmrti when it states that realization of the Self by means of Yoga is the highest Dharna. Then the same Smrti provides 2400 study of the Veda, perform ance of sacrificos, brahmacarya ( sexual purity), tapas and dama (restraint of senses), faith, fasting and freedom from attach ment to worldly objects; these are the causes of securing know ledge of the Atman,&rsquo; It should be noticed that some of these fall under yama, niyama and pratyāhūra.

<p>The Yogasūtras are difficult and do not give complete explanations of the several stages of Yogic practices. They are in the nature of brief notes or hints that are calculated to rouge the curiosity of the hearer or reader and induce him to go to a competent teacher and learn Yoga practices. A few examples may be cited. Y. S. II. 50 refers to three kinds of Prāṣāyāmas, and II. 51 mentions &amp; fourth (bāhyābhyantaraviṣayāksepi caturthah). There is no further explanation of this 4th variety. In IV. 1 Patañjali lumps together siddhis arising from janma, oṣadhi, mantra, tapas and samadhi. There is a vast difference</p>

<p>between a siddhi due to a drug and siddhis due to samadhi. Patañjali says that one is the symbol of Isvara and that repeti lion thereof and reflection on its meaning is a means of attain. ing ekāgratā, but there is no explanation why Om is expressive of Isvara nor is any reference made to the Upaniṣads &amp;c. about the importance of Om or how japa is to be performed. This is probably due to the agelong tradition that spiritual knowledge should be kept secret, should not be taught to all and sundry, but only to a disciple possessing certain qualifications, Already on pp, 1071-72 notes 1733, 1734 it has been shown from a fow Upaniṣad quotations how esoteric knowledge was imparted only by a guru to a disciple. In the dialogue of Yājāavalkya and Artabhāga (Bṛ. Up. III. 2. 13), when the latter asked, after saying after a man&rsquo;s death his speech enters fire, his breath enters into wind, his eye into the sun, his body into the earth&rsquo; ' where does thon the man remain?&rsquo; Yājāavalkya replied take my hand, on this matter we two alone must come to some understanding, but not here in the midst of company.&rsquo; Then the two went aside and conferred with one another. That shows that the knowledge about what happens after death was not held to be a matter proper for being discussed in an assembly of people. The Chāndogya Up. (III. 11. 5) states therefore a father may tell that doctrine of Brahma to his eldest son or to a worthy pupil but not to anyone else even if the latter gave him this earth girt by waters (seas) and full of wealth, for this doctrine is worth more than that'. The Bṭ. Up. VI. 3. 12 provides one should not speak of it (brahma doctrine) to one who is not his son or pupil'; vide Sv. Up. VI. 22, Maitrāyaṇi Up. VI. 29 for similar words. The Sāntiparva in a chapter dealing with spiritual knowledge provides that it should be imparted to one&rsquo;s dear son and an obedient disciple, but not to one whose mind is not quiescent nor controlled, nor one who is jealous or crooked or a backbiter or a logic-chopper,2x02 H. Y. P. states &amp; Yogin desirous of attaining siddhi should keep the knowledge of Hatha as highly secret; it becomes potent if kept secret, but becomes impotent if exposed to all; one should practise yoga alone in the way expounded by the guru &lsquo;. 2403 This applied in ancient</p>

The Nirukta (IL. 3) says that it (Nirukta) should not be taught to one who does not know grammar, nor to one who does not approach (the guru) for knowledge or who is not aware of the importance of the śāstra, since an ignorant person always beara ill-will to knowledge; and the Nirukta quotes (II. 4) four verses (called Vidyāsūkta) on this matter, 2404 In the Bhagavad gitā Krṣpa frequently emphasizes that the knowledge of Bhakti. yoga is a sovereign secret ( IX %), in XVII. 63 the knowledge conveyed to Arjuna is stated to be more secret than all secreta and in XVIII, 64-65 Kșṣpa asks Arjuna to listen to the most secret words of his viz. &ldquo;fix they mind on Me, be my dovotes, offer sacrifice to me, prostrate thyself before me; thou shalt come to me; I promise to theo truly as thou art dear to me! This last is repeated from IX. 34. At the end of shap. XV it ia said &lsquo;o blameless one! this most secret doctrine has been ex. pounded by me to you&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Whether the path of Yoga is desirable or feasible in its entirety cannot be debated here. But thors have been great men in India for thousands of years who have trodden the path of Yoga that led to the desired goal of freedom of the self from i vidyā and the bondage of birth and death by means of Yoga, Even as early as the Santiparva (chap. 289, cr. ed. verses 50 and 54), the path of yoga is said to be very difficult and that it is easy to stay on the sharp edges of razors, but that those whose souls are not purified would find it difficult and painful to continually practine Dhāraṇās. Kālidāsa so finely describes in the 8th canto of the Raghuvarsa ( verses 16-24) how Yoga was practised by king Raghu. Kalidasa refers (in VIII, 16) to apavarga as the goal of the ascetic Raghu 88 contrasted with mahodaya ( abhyudaya or bhoga), both words occurring in Y. 8. II. 18 (prakāśa &hellip; &hellip; bhogāpavargārtham drāyam); mentions dbāraṇā (in VIII. 18), pranidhāna practice and consequent mastery over the five prāṇas (in Raghu VIII. 19, Y. 8. II. 45</p>
<p>• samādhisiddhiriśvara-prapidhānāt); mastery over the three guṇas that constitute prakti (Raghu VI, 21. Y. 8. H. 48 mentions pradhānajaya), Yogavidhi as a means of paramal madarsana (Raghu VIII, 2%, Yaj. smrti I. 8 quoted in note 2399).</p>

<p>Rājayoga holds the supreme goal to be liberation from Nature (prakrti) or Maya of the Advaita) and its attitude towards the world of senses and our empirical life is that of shunning these. Mukti means absorption into brahnu for the Vedantist or Kaivalya ( isolation of the Individual self from the boods of birth and death and from praksti according to pure Yoga). For the vast majority of men and women the path and final goal of Pātañjala Yoga or of the Advaita Vedānta are almost inaccessible and unattainable, as the Gita itself states (XII.5) &ldquo;Those whose mind is set on the Unmanifested encounter greater difficulties (than those who worship &amp; personal God), since the goal of the unmanifested is hard to coach by embodied beings&rsquo;. The path of Karmayoga (performing good deeds and acts prescribed by Śāstra without hankering for rewards) and Bhaktiyogn (wherein there is deep devotion to God and self-surrender) appear to be more suitable and practical for ordinary human beings. The Gita in chap. XIII. (verses 13-17) contains one of the best descriptions of God as transcendent and immanent and verse 18 adds that the devotee of God who under stands this reaches God.</p>
<p>Many readers familiar with Shri Aurobindo&rsquo;s ātrama at Pondicherry and his voluminous writings might express surprise at the present author&rsquo;s non-mention (in what precedes) of Shri Aurobindo (who is called Mahāyogi by his disciples and admirers) in this section on Yoga and its influence on Dharma śāstra. But the reasons are obvious. In the first place, Shri Aurobindo says hardly anything about Dharmaśāstra in relation to Yoga. In the 2nd place, Shri Aurobindo admits that he had &lsquo;no touch from a guru&rsquo;, that he got an inner touch and practised Yoga, that he got some help from Mr. Lele of Gwalior, that when he came to Pondicherry he got from within a programme for his sādhanī, that he could not make much progress as to the help to be given to others and that when the Mother (Mira Richard ) came to the ūśrama in 1920 he found with her aid the method of helping others. In the next place, he departs from the teachings of a galaxy of Sanskrit writers on Yoga, viz, that &amp; yogin must shun woman (vide p. 1421 and note 2330), while his biographer Mr. Diwakar states that the Aurobindo Ashram was founded on 24th November 1926, that the Mother was entirely in charge of it from that day and that Shri Aurobindo thencs forward cut off all contacts except through the Mother (p. 257). In this, he strikes an entirely new line and appears to ordinary</p>

<p>men like the prosent author to have diverged far from the well trodden path of ancient Yoga and become like one described in the well-known words (&lsquo;Murārostrtiyaḥ panthāh&rsquo;). Shri Aurobindo is a mystic, 2405 the experiences of mystics are peculiar and their own, ordinary words and modes of speech fail to communicate thom to those that cannot claim to have over shared such experiences. Aurobindo became a recluse from November 1926 to his Mahāsamādbi on 5th December 1950 and gave darśana 2406 only on four days in the year viz. 15th August (his birth date.), 24th November ( day of victory for him), 21st February ( the birth date of the Mother) and 24th April the day of the Mother&rsquo;s coming to the Ashrama (vide Mr. Diwakar&rsquo;s &lsquo;life of Mahāyogi&rsquo; p. 265). For forty years Aurobindo lived in Pondicherry. His Ashram became a centre of the gospel of integrated Yoga and a home for those who sought real life and light, a place of pilgrimage for men and women attracted by his teachings.</p>
<p>On 15th August 1947 when India attained Independence (which happened to be the date of Aurobindo&rsquo;s birth ) he issued a long statement referring to the dreams of his youth, which he thought were arriving at fruition or were on their way to achievement. He stated the first of these dreams was a revolu tionary movement which would create a free and united India. Another dream was the resurgence and liberation of the peoples of Asia and her return to her great role in the progress of human civilization. The third dream was a world union forming the outor basis of a fairer, brighter and nobler life for all mankind.

<p>It is difficult to give an accurate definition of mysticism'. W. R. Iage in his works &lsquo;Christian Mysticism&rsquo; publishes 26 definitions of the word in an Appendix. James H. Leuba defiaes it as follors; &ldquo;Mysticism means for us any experience taken by the experiencer to be a contact (aot through the senses, but immediate or intuitive) or anion of the self with a larger than self, be it called the World Spirit, God, the Absolute or other wise&rdquo; (&lsquo;Paychology of religious mysticism,&rsquo; Kegan Paul, 1929).

Another dream, the spiritual gift of India to the world, has already begun; India&rsquo;s spirituality is entering Europe and America in an ever-increasing measure. The final dream was a step in evolution which would raise man to a higher and larger con sciousness and begin the solution of the problems which have perplexed and vexed him since he began to think and to drearu of individual perfection and a perfect society. Here too, if the evolution is to take place, since it must proceed through a growth of the spirit and the inner consciousness, the initiative can come from India and, although the scope must be universe!, the central movement may be hors',</p>
<p>These emotional and eloquent words are flattering to the pride of all Indian people, but it is possible that, bearing in mind that the whole of India was mostly under the boel of ruthless or exploiting conquerors for over seven hundred years from the 13th century A. D. (except for some parts and for brief periods as under the Vijayanagar Empire or under the Marathas for about 150 years and for about 50 years under Maharaja Ranjit Singh in Panjab) these proud assertions of Aurobindo are likely to bring derisive smiles on the faces of many non Indian readers. It is for discerning Indian readers to judge whether any of the dreams of Shri Aurobindo (except the first about 2407 Independence) are on the way to achievement or realization, whether during the last fourteen years after Independ ence India has progressed in the way of spirituality among men in general, whether there is any likelihood of there being a union of peoples and nations in the near future or whethor the world is on the brink of a precipice.</p>
<p>Shri Aurobindo had set his heart on the unity of the human race by an inner oneness and purpose and not by an external association of interests ; for 24 years he completely withdrew from the outer world and gave darśana only on four days in the year.

Pass ages quoted from his letters by Shri Diwakar (on p. 258) clarify what visions he had there will be first a race representing the supermind as man represents the mind&rsquo;, &lsquo;in what I am trying to do the spiritual realization is the first necessity, but it cannot be complete without an outor realisation also in life, in mon in this world, spiritual consciousness within but also spiritual life without&rsquo;. About his Sadhanā he says &lsquo;I began my Yoga in 1904. My Sadhanā was not founded upon books but upon personal experiences that crowded on me from within&hellip;&hellip; It is a fact that I was hearing constantly the voice of Vivekananda speaking to me for a fortnight in the Jail&rsquo; (p. 131 of Mr. Diwakar&rsquo;s book).</p>
<p>In a letter to his brother Barindra dated 7th April 1920 which is set out in full on pp. 309-314 in the work &lsquo;Sri Auro bindo on himself and on the Mother&rsquo; (1953), Aurobindo esserts &lsquo;the main defect in the old Yogas consisted in the fact that they know mind and intelligence and the Atman; they used to be satisfied with spiritual experience on the mental level; but the mind is capable of only partial knowledge and it can comprehend only parts and not the whole. The mind can know the infinite and the total reality only through Samadhi, Moksha or Nirvana and by no other means. Of course, some people do attain this kind of Moksha which may be said to be a blind alley. But then what is the use of it? But what the Bhagwan intends to do with man is to enable him to realize God in life, in the in dividual as well as in the collective society (to manifest God in life). The old systems of Yoga could not bring about &amp; synthesis or unity between spirituality and life; they disposed of the world calling it Māyā or the transitory play of the Lord. The result is vitality and vigour in life have been sapped and India has decayed&rsquo;. In this passage Aurobindo tries to bring out the distinotion between his integral Yoga and the Yoga of ancient and medieval Indians. There is hardly anything very new in his theory of Yoga The Gita also says the same in . ajčānenāvśtam' (Gita V, 15), in &ldquo;utsideyur-ime loka' (Gita II. 24-25, II. 47, III. 8, 19, LX, 27, XVIII. 45–46, all of which emphasize that disinterested work is worship of God). Aurobindo should have brought into being an organised body of workers after his own heart. The Patañjala Yoga does not employ the</p>

<p>History of Dharmaśāstra (Soo. VIII, Ch. XXXII</p>
<p>word Māyā at all nor did it say that the world was a play of God. It was the Vedanta-sūtra II, 1, 33 (lokavat-tu lilakaivalyam) that said go by way of ropelling an objection. In the Patañjala yoga Iyara has nothing to do with the creation of the world (vide abovo pp. 1402-3) but it speaks of avidyā by which the individual self is enmeshed (Y. S. II. 3-5 and 24) and not God or the Supreme Self. Besides one is tempted to sobo the question of Aurobindo himself What is the use of integral Yoga, mind, overmind and supermind?' Can anybody point out even half &amp; dozen men and diariples of Aurobindo who have devoted all their energies to the regeneration of the country and of the human race on his lines? The position of the Ashram itself is rather vague, anomalous and undefined. But it is unnecessary to say in this work anything further about it. 2408</p>
<p>The writings of Shri Aurobindo are numerous and voluminous. For &amp; list of his writings along with a few other works, vide the Bibliography (pp. 267–269 ) given by Shri Diwakar at the end of his work &lsquo;Mahāyogi&rsquo;. The present author bas read only the following works of Shri Aurobindo &lsquo;Yoga and its objects&rsquo; (1938, a brief work in which &lsquo;adhyātma Yoga&rsquo; is said to be higher than Hathayoga and Rajayoga); The Mother' (1937), &lsquo;Essays on the Gita (5th ed. of 1949), &lsquo;The Synthesis of Yoga&rsquo;(1948) which attempts to show that all three paths, viz. of knowledge (Jõānayoga), of Devotion ( Bhaktiyoga) and of Divine works ( Karmayoga) can be integrated; &ldquo;the problem of Rebirth&rsquo;(published by the Aurobindo Ashram in 1952 after his passing away); &lsquo;Foundations of Indian culture&rsquo; (essays brought together in one volume, revised by Shri Aurobindo), Now York, 1953; Aurobindo&rsquo;s Magnum Opus is &lsquo;Life Divine (originally in three volumes, now available in one of 1272 pages, published by the Aurobindo International University Contre, Pondicherry 1955). The prosent author has read only the first volume of this last work. Men of ordinary intelligence like the present writer find this philosophical work not easy to read, and are often at a loss to find out, in the flood of high sounding phrases used by Shri Aurobindo concerning the mind, overmind,</p>

<p>supermind, his precise meaning. Only one sentence is cited here for sample (from p. 345 of the big one volume edition); &lsquo;Overmind, intuition, even supermind not only must be principles inherent and involved in the Inconscience from which we arise in the evolution and inevitably destined to evolve, but are secretly present, oocult actively with flashes of intuitive emergence in the cosmic activity of mind, life and matter. The present author regards the book &lsquo;Foundations of Indian culture as the best of the works of Shri Aurobindo which he has read. Prof. R. D. Ranade in his Lectures on &lsquo;Bhagavadgitā as a philosophy of God Realization&rsquo; (Nagpur, 1959 pp. 163-176) submits to examination Aurobindo&rsquo;s &lsquo;Essays on the Gita&rsquo; and disagrees with him on some points. While these pages were passing through the press the present writer received a copy of &lsquo;Integral Philosophy of Aurobindo&rsquo;, &amp; symposium edited by Dr. Haridas Chaudhuri and Dr. Frederic Spiegelborg (and published by Allen and Unwin, 1960), which contains 30 papers written by Indian and Western scholars on the Philosophy of Aurobindo, p. 32 defining the eggence of integral Yoga and p. 44 distinguishes between &lsquo;mind&rsquo; and &lsquo;supermind&rsquo; (of Aurobindo&rsquo;s philosophy).</p>

<p>Tarka and Dharmaśāstra</p>
<p>The Yāñavalkyasmrti (I. 3) mentions Nyāya (logic )2409 ag one of the fourteen vidyās and as one of the means of knowing what Dharma is. Nyāya is rendered as &lsquo;tarkavidyā&rsquo; by the Mitākṣarā on Yāj. and the Mit. states that the fourteon vidyās are the hetu (moans) of ( knowing) dharma,</p>
<p>Both the Nyāyasūtra and the Vaiśeṣikasūtra of Kanāda postulate that &lsquo;nihśreyasa&rsquo; follows from the correct knowledge of the categories of the two darśanas, 2410</p>
<p>One of the earliest occurrences of the word tarka is in the Kathopaniṣad 2421 where it is declared &ldquo;This knowledge about the Self) cannot be obtained by (mere) ratiocination&rsquo; and the previous verse states that the Self is subtler than the subtlest and not capable of being understood by mere inference or reasoning. The word &lsquo;mantavyaḥ&rsquo; in the passage 2412 • Ātmā vā are drastavyaḥ śrotavyo mantavyo&rsquo; (in Bṭ. Up. II, 4. 5 and IV.5.6) is held by the objector (in bhāsya on V. S. I. 1. 2) and also by Saṅkarācārya as referring to tarka on V.S. II. 1.4. Tarka is accepted as an anga of Yoga in the Maitrāyaṇi Up. (vide note 2327 above), which further quotes a passage stating that by the control of speech, mind and prāṇa one apprehends brahman</p>

<p>with the help of tarka. 2413 The Gautamadharmasūtra 2414 remarks &lsquo;tarka is the means for securing justice ( among contending parties)&rsquo;. One of the replies given by Yudhisthira to the Yakṣa guarding a lake is &lsquo;ratiocination is unstable (leads to no certain conclusions), the Vedic texts differ (among themselves), there is no single sage whose opinion is held authoritative (by people or other Bages); the essence of Dharma is placed in a care (i. e. is enveloped in darkness and cannot be seen clearly), that is the path (to be followed) by which the majority of people 2415 proceed&rsquo;. This appears to make man in the mass the ultimate tribunal on all questions of value. In its peroration at the end, the Manusmrti observes &lsquo;one who desires to secure the pure Dharma must know well the three viz. direct perception (or experience), inference, and śāstra based on various traditions ; none but that man who considers the sayings of sages (i. e. the Veda), the instruction on Dharma (contained in the Smrtis) with the help of reasoning that does not ( directly) conflict with Veda and sāstras knows what Dharma is &lsquo;, 2416 This is the position of most orthodox Sanskrit writers about Tarka. Their reasoning appears to have been this. If one were to rely on mere reason, the result would be uncertainty and anarchy. Every theorist states that his system is based on reason; but the angwers arrived at on the basis of reason as to questions of vital importance to ordinary men are bewilderingly different. Thinkers brought up in different environments and of different experiences have different logics and propound even different moral laws. Whom should an ordinary man follow? The Vedas and Smṛtis</p>

<p>embody the principles of conduct in all spheres of life arrived at by eminent and solfloas sages during the course of thousands of years i, e, they embody the experiences and the reasonings of numerous wise men. Therefore, if a modern man says that reason leads him to hold opinions opposed to the Veda, most people are not prepared to accept a single man&rsquo;s opinion pitted against the views of numerous ancient sages. This point deed not be elaborated further. On many important questions viz. whether there is God or a Supreme Intelligence guiding the universe, or whether there is an individual self, or what the future of a man when he dies is, the wisest among mop have given widely differing answers.2117 On such questions final answers acceptable to all or most people cannot be given by reason alone. Though the orthodox position is as stated above, it has been shown above (e. g. on pp. 1267-1269) how Vedic practices have boon discarded by the weight of popular opinion from time to time. It is laid down by Smrti writers themselves that blindly following the words of Sastra would lead to loss of Dharma and that in case of conflict between two Smṛtis reasoning should be resorted to and popular opinions and practices should be con- , sidered. Vide H. of Dh. vol III, pp. 866-868 for this. The Mahabharata enjoins 2418 &lsquo;one should not try to solve incompre hensible matters by ratiocination.&rsquo; In the dialogue between the famished sage Viśvāmitra (who desired to eat the tail of a dog) and a cāndāla the great Epic winds up by saying therefore &amp; learned man whose soul is pure should act after relying on his intelligence in the matter of deciding what Dharma and adharma are&rsquo; 2419 It should not be supposed that Saṅkarācārya and other great Indian writers wanted to throw reasoning over. board altogether.

<p>conclusions arrived at by reasoning are in direct conflict with Vedic and smrti texts. Saṅkarācārya clearly states his position on 7. 8. II, 1, 1. and 11.2420 Beliefs (such as those of Jains and Buddhists) were held to be heterodox, because they did not acknowledge the authority of the Veda and the sacred tradition, though they often observad Hindu practices and married with Hindus; but within this limit there was room enough for an enormous and bewildering variety of convictions, rites and practices that olaimed to be orthodox. This may be illustrated by the attitude of some Upaniṣads. For example, the Mundaka Up. (I.1.4-5) speaks of two vidyās, parā and aparā, includes under aparā the four Vedas and the six angas and parā (highest) vidyā is that by which the imperishable brahman is attained. In the Chan. Up. (VII. 1.1-5) when Nārada approached Sanat kumāra for instruction, the former recounted what he had already learnt viz. the four Vedas, Itihasapurāṇa and other lores; then Sanatkumāra tells him that all that he has studied is mere name and then explains what is better than all those. Mundaka (I. 2.7 ) condemns yajfias as leaky vessels. It is extremely surprising that the Chān. Up. in I. 12. 2-5 compares the procedure of the five priests and the sacrificer touching each other and creeping from the sadas towards the cātvala where the Bahiṣpavamāna chant is to be sung with a procession of dogs, each dog holding the tail of the preceding dog in his mouth. Vide for the creeping of priests noiselessly and silently Tāndya Brāhmaṇa VI, 7, 9-12 and Ap. Srauta-sūtra XII, 17.1-4 and H. of Dh, vol. II. pp. 1166 and 1169. Though this is so, the Upa piṣads are called Vedanta, are looked upon as orthodox and as the highest end of the Vedic religion and literature. Most anoient Upaniṣads, however, quote Vedic Samhita taxts as autho rities. For example, Bṭ. Up. 1. 4. 10 and Ait. Up. II. 5 quote Rg. IV. 26. 1 and IV. 27.1 respectively; Bṛ, Up. I. 5. 16-17 quote Rg. I. 116, 12 and I. 117. 22 and Bṭ. Up. L. 5. 19 cites Rg. VI. 47. 18; Katha IV. 9 is the same as Atharvaveda X 8. 16, Prasna I 11 is quoted from Rg. I. 164. 1%.

<p>provides that brahmavidya is to be expounded to brotriyas (those who have studied the Veda). Horain tha Upaniṣads rely upon the principle of adbikārabhoda</p>
<p>One of the oldest philosophical problems is Authority and Reason or to put it in different words, Faith and Reason and there has been throughout the ages a constant struggle between these two. Most men want to rely on some authority, on some one deered higher than themselves. For vast numbers of people this authority or the something greater than themselves is Reve lation and God. They have neither the leisure nor the inclina tion nor the intellectual ability to think for themselves rationally on such abstruse questions as the existence of God or an in dividual self, free will and determinism, the general principles of conduct, the final destiny of men after physical death &amp;o. In sociological matters human judgement is often warped by prevailing dogmas and prejudices; on questions which are deemed to be religious (and in India the field of matters deemed to be religious has always been very extensive) a frank discus. sion is almost impossible without creating anger and rancour. Several ethical questions such as divorce and birth control often assume the position of religious dogmas and when openly discussed create great heat. In several so-called democracies of the present day rational discussion comes last and vital questions are determined by party loyalties or by personality culte or by lust for power and self-aggrandisement. It should not be supposed that ancient and medieval India had no ration alists por atheists. As a matter of fact there were several rationalists. Vide the prosent author&rsquo;s note 875 pp. 358-359 in H. of Dh. Vol. I, Vol. III, pp. 46-47 note 57 on Lokayatas and their views, 2421 and pp. 974–975 note 1596 above for rationalistio criticism of sacrifices, śrāddhas &amp;o. Many ration alists hold that there is no proof of the existence of God, they deny an individual soul, they deny immortality and the existence of any intelligence in the universe higher than man&rsquo;a, deny that there is any design or purpose in the Universe and they believe that in all religions there is some truth mixed with a great deal of error. The case of the rationalist is that</p>

<p>Rationalists&rsquo; arguments</p>
<p>1473</p>
<p>he should not be called upon to prove that there is no God (which is a negative proposition), that it is for theists to prove that God exists (which is a positive proposition) and that he is omnipotent and omniscient. They say that to attribute anger, love, pity to God is to implicitly negative God&rsquo;s omnipotence. The problem of evil in the world is, according to rationalists, a great stumbling blook in accepting God as good, kind, all knowing and all-powerful. The rationalist might agree with the theist that man as an individual depends on something greater than himself that is able to give directions and to punish him for the disobedience of directions. For the rationa list it is some kind of community or society in which men live and have their being that is greater than themselves. This would be substituting the worship of the human community or of collective human power for the worship of God. What human community is to be in the place of God? Is it to be the whole buman race (now having over two thousand million human beings ) or some big or small groups out of these? There are now two well-defined blocks between whom there is a conflict of ideological ends, viz, the communist block represented by the U. 8. S. R. and China and the capitalistic block represented by U. S. A., England and several other countries of Europe, and &amp; third unorganized block of countries professing to have no alignment with anyone of the two blooka,</p>
<p>In these days Communism is really a form of worship i. e. worship of man or men in place of the worship of God. It may be conceded that probably the masses of the Russian people are far better off in the matter of physical needs than they were in the regime of the Tsars. The magnos seem to have devotion to Communism. But that devotion is more apparent than real, based on the hope of quiok gains or the fear of prompt punishment and is the product of rigid State control of education and the environment. The communists have an attractive slogan in the words Workors of the world I unite, you have nothing to lose but your chains.&rsquo; There are also the catchwords &lsquo;Dictatorship of the proletariat.&rsquo;. But this ends in fact in a dictatorship of the Communist Party over the proletariat. In return for physioal well-being the common people have had to bargain away several freedoms, freedom to think for themselves, freedom of expression, freedom of intercourse with foreigners, freedom to choose their ocoupation &amp;o. The commu nista make no secret that they want to bring the whole world under Communism. Therefore, they pose that they are the</p>

<p>History of Dharmasastra [ Seo. VIII, Ch. XXXIII</p>
<p>saviours of common men and women throughout the world and they cannot be charged with aggression since they mean to liberate people from the bonds of capitalism or colonialism &amp;o. Their creed is one of fanaticism, of intolerance or hatred of others. The only experiment of a godless society on a large scale was made by the Soviet, but it does not appear to outsiders to have been a happy or successful one. The universal exhibi tion of portraits of great Soviet leaders ( some of whom were declared by successor leaders to be no better than murderera ) 2422 proclaims the necessity of worship even in a godless society. Dictators have nationalized not only all the means of the produca tion of wealth but also all the labour in the country. They have established themselves in the place of God and desire to have total control over the bodies and tbe minds of all their subjects. The faith of the communists is that their country is a heaven on earth and one must accept their word for that without wanting to see for one self the real state of things. The Communists have their own special versions of history, economios and science. These one must not question.</p>
<p>The followers of Judaism, Christianity and Islam (all believing in one God and one Book ) did not hesitate for centuries to inculcate their doctrines and practices by terrible persecutions and bloody wars. This spirit is very shocking to people brought up in Hinduism or Buddhism. If Rationalists substitute blocks of humanity or the leaders of such blocks for worship and authority, humanity itself would soon be wiped out. Conceding for argument that the existence of an omnipotent and omniscient Power cannot be proved to the satisfaction of the so-called rationalists, the present writer feels that it is for the good of most societies consisting of millions of common men and women that they believe in God and the individual soul. Most men are influenced to keep to the path of virtue and right by the fear of God, by the prickings of conscience (which is the inner light implanted in man by God), by the fear of public opinion, and by fear of punishment at the hands of the rulers of the State (vide</p>

<p>Rationalists&rsquo; arguments discussed</p>
<p>1475</p>
<p>Santiparva quoted in H. of Dh, vol II, p. 389 note 619). Those who reject the first of these would have to reject the 2nd also and would have to fall back upon hedonism (the greatest pleasure for themselves) or the idea of greatest good of the greatest number or progress towards some ideal state of society painted by imagination. The pursuit of purely secular or worldly happi. ness is incompatible with the precepts and ideals of Hinduism and all higher religions, Rationalism accepts the postulates which science finds convenient and useful. Though these postulates work well up to certain limits, it must be said that those limits are very narrow. Science aims at establishing general rules or laws. From those laws we know only the behaviour of nature and how man can utilize natural forces for realizing human aims; but science does not tell us what those aims should be, it is amoral and not concerned with morals or spirituality. Rationalism appears to smother many experiences of the human mind which are beyond the present machinery of science. When the scientific method is adopted in social studies, there is little to show that it leads to increased wisdom about the values that should be pursued. Rationalism insists that all our beliefs ought ultimately to be based on tangible and definite grounds and that modern scientific method is the only reliable method for acquiring knowledge of all kinds. But there are sub-conscious and non-rational impulses, beliefs and intuitions in men that are held by men to be truer or of a higher order than what is on the rationalistic level (vide W. James&rsquo; Varieties of religious experience' p. 74, ed. of 1920). It should be the endeavour of leaders of thought in each generation to find out what is essential and vital in tradition (without believing in the infallibility of all traditions) and to present reasoned dogmas which, while retaining the essential elements of tradition, will meet the demands of modern thought and conditions and obvironment. It is not necessary to say here more about modern rationalism. For over two thousand years our ancient writers and smptis like those of Manu (XII. 105-106 which are relied upon by Kumārila himself as shown on p. 1261 above) have allowed to tarka a place in the matter of finding out what Dharma is and have been most tolerant of differing views open on fundamental matters as shown above and brought about great changes even in religious rituala, philosophical views, social customs and practices without perpetrating atrocities and indulging in wholesale persooutions.

A more radical tolerance than what our people showed throughout the ages is almost unthinkable. Western writers while admitting great tolerance in religious views and practices harp often on the requirements about observing caste rules in matters of food, marriage etc. But caste is more a social institution than &amp; religious one and therefore just as in Western countries there were rules of etiquette and observance ( such as the number 13 and the regulations against working on Sabbath and against theatre going, card playing and physical exercise except walk. ing) that had to be observed meticulously, in India caste ruleg had to be observed. Besides, even when caste rules were brokon the offender had in a meeting of the caste people to admit his mistake, to pay a fine to the caste or village temple and then was restored to all privileges of the casto. As the Christian churches were extremely intolerant of the slightest departuro from religious views held at particular times, there arose in Europe the emphasis on rationalism and freedom to hold opinions. Government could effectively mould the opinions of its subjects by controlling education, by censorship of books and by inflicting severe penalties on those who expressed opinions opposed to those espoused by them. The Roman Church prepared an Index of forbidden books and an Index expurgatorius (a list of passages to be expunged from books that were otherwise permitted). The first Index Librorum Prohibitorius in its latest edition (before 1949) contains 5000 titles. Lecky in his &lsquo;History of the rise and influence of ration alism in Europe&rsquo; 2423 points out to the extirpation of Christianity from Japan, of Protestantism from Spain, of the Huguenots from France, of most Catholics from England. The Jesuits acted on the 2424 principle that the end justifies the means.</p>

Not much difference is made to religion whether the Sun revolves round the earth or the earth round the sun. In this connection it may be pointed out that Aryabhata (born in 476 A, D.) appears to have held the view that the stars did not revolve round the earth, but the latter revolved round itself and gave the illustration of a man sitting in a moving boat feeling that it is the stationary objects on the banks that rush past in the opposite direction, 2425 The Pancasiddhāntikā (13. 6) of Varāhamihira refers to this view and rejects it, not on the ground that it is opposed to the Veda, but on the ground that, if that view were correct, hawks and other birds flying high up in the sky would not be able to come baok to their nests without fail. He did not know that the atmosphere also goes with the earth. This was more than eleven hundred years before Galileo and there is nothing to show that Aryabhata suffered in the least for his views. For Aryabhata&rsquo;s view vide &lsquo;Aryabhatiyam by W. E. Clark (Chicago, 1930 ) p. 64. As observed by Archibald Robertson the history of the Rationalist movement in Europa is to a very great extent the history of a fight for the right to bold and propagate opinions unpopular for the time being and the growth of religious toleration in Europe has in fact gone hand in hand with the decay of traditional religious beliefs. Reason arrives at different conclusions on the same matter in different ages and even in the same age what appears reasonable to one group of people is held to be unreasonable -by another people. Vide Robert Bridges&rsquo; &lsquo;Testament of Beauty&rsquo; Book I lines 465-470 on what is reasonable.

<p>Doubt has been and is a frequent and legitimate attitude of the mind as recognised by the Bf. Up. (I. 5. 3) Kāmah sankalpo vioikitsa sraddbā, aśraddhā, dhritir, adhritir hrir-dhir bhir-etyetat sarvam mana ova' (desire, fancy, doubt, faith, want of faith, steadiness, restlessness, shame, understanding, fear, all these are aspects of mind). Even the Rgveda (11. 12. 5) refers to doubters about Indra (utom āhur-naisostityonam'). In the Katha Up. Naciketas says &ldquo;when a man dies there is tha doubt, some saying &lsquo;he (the self) exists&rsquo;, others saying &lsquo;he ceases to exist&rdquo; and prays to Yama to resolve that doubt for him as the third boon.</p>
<p>Descartes held that only one truth is beyond doubt viz, coyito ergo sum (I think, therefore I am). In Europe the whole of the 18th and 19th centuries were dominated as far as thought ful men were concerned by boundless faith in reason and progress. But owing to the two world wars ( particularly the second), their aftermath and the rise of two powerful Communist countries have greatly weakened the faith in progress guided by reason and ethics, faith in the dignity of man and in equality is on the decline and is assailed in many regions and the view that might creates or is right is gaining ground.</p>
<p>The Upanisada teach that a sound moral preparation must precede the acquisition of true vedantic view. The Bļ. Up. states therefore one who knows this, after securing quiescence, restraining his senses, being free from all hankerings, bearing with fortitude all pairs of opposites (such as heat and cold), having his mind concentrated, sees the Self in the self, looks upop everything as Ātman&rsquo;; the Kathopaniṣad II. 24 says &lsquo;one who has not ceased from doing evil actions, who is not quiescent, who bas not concentrated his mind nor has made his mind quiescent would not realize this Self by correct knowledge&rsquo;; Praśna I 16 those secure the pure world of brahman who are free from crookedness, falsehood and deceitful conduct'; Sv. Up. VL 22 &lsquo;this highly esoteric knowledge of Vedanta should not be imparted to one whose mind is not quiescent or who is not a son or disciple&rsquo;. The great formula thou art That' teaches one to look upon all men as Atman or as the Gita (VI, 29-30) puts it &ldquo;he who is endowed with Yoga and knows Atman to be in everything and everything as abiding in Ātman, is not lost to the Lord nor is the Lord lost to him'. Compare Isa Up. 6 and Manu XII. 91. In the Chan, Up. (III. 16. 1) man is symbolically represented as sacrifice and in III, 17, 4 it is statedVedāntu supports pure morality</p>
<p>1479</p>
<p>that lapas, charity, straightforward conduct, ahimga and truth fulness are the dakṣiṇā (sacrificial fees).</p>
<p>This shows that Vedānta in its highest form is the best support of pure morality for individuals. It is on account of this teaching that many sages cultivated these virtues in hermitages and were honoured by kings and common people in ancient times in India, but in medieval times the gages became2426 rare and as regards common people they were tied down by customs and caste and very few people made strenuous efforts for solidarity of all their countrymen, for meeting their common needs and safeguarding all peoples' interests; and by the side of sublime philosophical tonets our country witnessed abject poverty among large masses of people and political domination by alien or brutal invaders. The tendency to rely on the Vedas, to believe and to argue that what has been is the best, and to appeal to the past has been very strong throughtout our history for centuries. Our motto must not be &lsquo;back to the Vedas&rsquo; but rather &lsquo;forward with the Vedas&rsquo;. While giving due weight to the Veda and authority, we must not condemn all independence in thought.</p>
<p>Some Western rationalists such as Bentham, James Mill and John S. Mill put forward the theory of utilitarianism which briefly comes to this that actions are to be judged by their consequences and are right in proportion as they tend to make for the greatest good or happiness of the community or of the greatest number. This theory has great drawbacks, the most important being that it is not really a moral theory at all ag it does not tell us exactly what a man or community ought to do. Religions tell their followers what they ought to do or not to do. Another difficulty is that what may appear to one man as being for the greatest good of the greatest number may not be so accepted by others and further it is diffioult to define what the greatest number regards as good or happiness. Besides, many non care nothing at all about the happiness of others. Moral, political and economic actions are confused by this dootrine. In practice, as the emphasis was put on happiness, this theory</p>

<p>The present author is not at all against freedom of thought, but what he objects to is making a fetish of rationalism and making millions of common men and women water in their faith and principles of conduct by the constant talk of the non existence of God or of the individual soul &amp;c. The rationalists and utilitarians hardly agrae upon any values and principles of conduct to be inculcated among ordinary young men and women. If God and soul be eliminated, they have not been able to put something niore valuable in their place, for which the young generation that is growing up would be ready to live laborious days or to sacrifice thomselves. Though we may not subscribe to the position that the last word of wisdom on all religious and social matters is to be found in the Veda or in the works of ancient sages and writers, even wise men may hesitate before they decide the question whether we should carry on a campaign for eradicating beliefs in God and an immortal self. The Gitā strikes the right note for most people when it utters the warning (III. 26 ) &lsquo;let not the knowing or wise man (the jñānin or vidrān) unsettle the minds of the ignorant that are attached to (certain) actions (by babit); the enlightened man, himself doing all work in the true spirit of a yogin, should set others to do all actions.&rsquo;</p>
<p>As a result of the two world wars in which unspeakable atrocities and barbarities 2427 were committed by highly educated and organized countries most of whose people professed Christianity, there is a revulsion of feeling and Beveral eminent men are busy in attributing the present difficulties to the decay of religious belief and in inviting bumanity to return to religion. But the crux of the problem is what religious beliefs and practices are to be inculcated and practised by men in the present age.

<p>All writers on Dharmaśāstra are agreed on the existence of God. They rarely enter upon the task of adducing arguments for the existence of God. Christian theologians for hundreds of years put forward various arguments pointing to the existence of God. They are briefly summarised in William James&rsquo;</p>
<p>• Varieties of religious experience' p. 437 (ed. of 1920). The cosmological argument reasons from the ordered univers to &amp; First Cause which must be conceived as God who must at least po88e88 whatever perfection the universe itself contains. The argument from purpose or design (teleological argument) based itself on the evidence of purpose or design in Nature and concludes that the First Cause (God) must be a creative intellect or mind. Then there are other arguments also such as the &lsquo;moral argument&rsquo;(viz. the moral law presupposes a law-giver), the argument ex consensu gentium (vir, there is widespread belief in God all over the world and it should carry weight).2439</p>

Mr. Westway (on p. 374 ) givea &amp; definite answer that there is no proof of the existence of God, but (on p. 387) he admits tbat the argument from design carries an extremely high degrea of probability and that he believes that the Universe is not merely a chance-made affair as some philosophers believe. The argument from design (for God&rsquo;s existence) is beld to have been sbattered by the theory of evolution. If everything has a cause, it is also argued, why should God not have a cause?

<p>The Upaniṣads speak of the Absolute brahman as the creator, preserver and destroyer of the bhulas ( beings or elements or both). For example, the Tai. Up. III. 1(Bhrgu 2430 is instruoted ty his father Varupa) desire to know that from which all bhutas spring, by which, after being created, they live (are sustained) and to which they return and are absorbed therein ; that is brahma'. This is the basic text on which V. S. I. 1.2 (jappādyasya yataḥ) is based. This means &lsquo;from which the creation (sustenance and dissolution) of this (world ) proceed&rsquo; (that is brahma). Another passage of the Tai. Up. (II. 1) states that &lsquo;from this Ātman Akāśa sprang. from ākāśa Vayu, from Vāyu Agni, from Agoi waters, from waters the earth, from earth plants, from plants food, from food man&rsquo;. A passage of the Chān. Up. states 2431 all this, indeed, is brahma; a man, cultivating restraint of the mind, should meditate on that (world) As springing from, ending in and breathing on account of that (brahma)'. This is the basis of V. S. I. 2. 1 ( sarvatra prasiddho padeśāt). Here the three attributes of brahma are creator, preserver and destroyer of the universe.</p>

<p>145</p>
<p>of brahma, 3432 To the objection that the Veda la concerned with rites, that some partions of it are meant for the praise of rites, that the Vedic mantras only remind the performer about the various ingredients of sacrifice, that, therefore, the Vedanta texte either serye no purpose at all or at the most give information about the soul of the sacrificer or the deity to be worshipped in sacrificos, the reply is given by the Vedāntasūtra 1. 1. 4 (tat-tu samantayāt), which means that all Vedānta texts are agreed that their parport is to establish that brahma, whioh has been postulated (in V.S.I.1.2)as the creator, preserver and absorber of the world has that charaoter and is omniscient and omnipotente</p>
<p>That the argument from design also was present to the minds of the propounders of Vedānta follows from the fact that the Vedantasutra (IL 2. 1, racanānupapattesca nanumānam) denies that the Pradhana of the Saṅkhya (that is postulated as acetana) can be inferred as the cause of the universe.283</p>
<p>It may be noted here that, according to Saṅkarācarya, the detailed -334 statements on the dootrine about creation contained in the Upanisads are not to be taken literally, that no special purpose dependent thereon can be found nor is such a purpose laid down by Sruti (Veda), but all those statements are intended to lead on to the knowledge of brahma and to expound the non difference of the world from brahma. 2435 From early times most</p>

<p>philosophers osoillate between the dootrine of the First Pelnoiple ag immanent in the universe and the dootrine that God is the creator and is transcendent. The Rgveda and Upaniṣads appear to postulate the first doctrine according to which the Absolute enters into it when it creates the Universe (Tai. Up. II. 6 &lsquo;tat srstvā tad-evānuprāvisat&rsquo;), Cbān. Up. VI. 2.1, VI. 3. %, BF, Up. I. 4. 10. They also speak of God as ruling the Universe (antaryāmin) as in Br. Up. III. 7. Kausitaki Up. III. 8. At that time there was no atomic theory. Early Greek thought also wavered between the two doctrinos. Later on came the rival theory of cosmology in which atoms played a great part, that was adumbrated by Democritus (died about 370 B. C. 200. to William James in &lsquo;Some Problems&rsquo;, and explained by Lucretius. In India also the Vaiśesikas put forward the theory that the world is paramāṇus (atoms). Kapāda or Kanabhuk (lit, one who assumes or subsists on kaṇas, very subtle partioles) is the reputed founder of the Vaiśeṣika system. He does not expressly say anything about God. But later medieval writers on Nyaya Vaiśesika combined the two doctrines of God and atoms. As the Tarkadipikā246 puts the theory it is as follows: when God desires to create, activity is produced among the atoms, two atoms join, dvyaṇuka (dyad) is produced, tryaṇuka is produoed from three dvyapukas and in the end the great earth is prodaced; of things created when God desires to bring about dissolution an aotivity is produced in the atoms. The atoms are eternal and infinite in number.</p>

<p>Nature and attributes of God</p>
<p>attributes of God. Most wors agreed that God is one without a 8600nd, is spiritual (and not physical, though several people worshipped Him in the form of Siya or Visgu a Davi), it mutable, omnipresent, omniscient, omnipotent, creator, holy, good and just &amp;c. Difficult anestions arise about belief in God. One or two may be mentioned: Is God omniscient in the coma pleted and strictest sense viz. whether he could do anything what over as he likes or whether there are certain things which he cannot do. Another question is whether all existing things other than himself have been created by him or whether there are some things whose existence is as ultimate as God&rsquo;s. All religions are faoed with difficulties and therefore religion is a matter of faith</p>
<p>Though the Rgveda is full of the deeds of and prayers to individual Gods (such as Agni, Indra, Mitra, Varuna, Soma), the Roveda containg several hymns and verses to the effect that the original Principle is only one, that it creates the world out of itself, enters into it and inspires it. In Rg. 1. 164.46 the sage says &ldquo;the wise speak of the One existing (principle) under various names, they call it Agni, Yama, Mātariśvan ( wind god). This is not a solitary verse. There are similar verses in the Rgyeda For example, Rgveda VIII, 58. % (&amp; verse from the Valakhilya hymns) says &ldquo;The one fire is kindled in many places, the one Sun appears in the whole world, the one Dawn shines over all this world and the One (Principle, Spirit) became all this&rsquo;, In Rs. X. 90.2, it is declared all this universe is (in reality) the Puruṣa alone, (both ) what has been and what will come into existence in future&rsquo;. In Rg. II. 1. 3–7 Agni is identified with Indra, Viṣnu, Brahma, Varuṇa, Mitra, Aryaman, Tvasts, Rudra, Draviṇodas, Savitr and Bhaga. All these versos establish that ultimately all plurality is only a play of words, a mere name (Vācārambhanam vikaro dāmadheyam' as the Obān. Up. VI. 1. 4 states) and that unity is the only Reality and that the fundamental teaching of the Upaniṣads appears in germ in the Rgyeda.</p>

<p>History of Dharmadastra (Soo. IX, on XXXIV</p>
<p>In the Rgveda there are several hymns about the creation of the world in the 10th Mapdala (X. 72, X. 81 and 82, X, 90. X. 121, X. 129). For reasons of space all these cannot be set out at length, but some important texts will be mentioned. The main purpose of the bymn (X. 72) is to desoribe the birth of eight Adityag. Rg. X. 72. 2 states 2438 that Brahmanaspati brought about the ( births of) gods like &amp; smith (that works with bellows) and that in the primeval ages of the Gods' sat was produced from asat. In Rg. X. 72. 4-5 and 8 it is said that Daksa was born from Aditi and Aditi from Dakṣa, that the gods were born after her (Aditi) and that from Aditi eight sons were born. The two bymos X. 81 and 82 refer to Viśvakarman who fashioned the worlds. X. 81.2 and 4 ask questions &lsquo;what was the base 2439 (from where he created the world), what was the</p>

The Br. Up. (I. 4. 7) states all this was then (before creation began) ondeveloped and it was developed by Dame and form'. Similarly, in the Tai. Up. II. 7 it is said H ET TEPAT M ia and Raatua. But the Cbān, Up. (VI. 3, 1-3) emphatically asserts &ldquo;in the beginning there was that only which was &lsquo;sat&rsquo;, one only without a second; some say &lsquo;in the beginning there was tbat only wbich is esat, from which arose sat&rsquo;; but how could it be tbus, how would sat (that which is) spring from asat (that wbich is not)? It is sat only that was at the beginning, ode without a second. It reflected &lsquo;may I be many, may I produce&rsquo;; it created fire &amp;c.&rdquo; Saṅkarācārya on V. S. I. 4. 15 refers to Tai. Up. II, 7 &lsquo;asad vā idam-agra āsit&rsquo; and Chāo. Up. III. 19. 1 &lsquo;asad-evodem agra asit&rsquo; and explains w bat is meant by asat in such passages viz. &lsquo;FTREET ज्याकृतवस्तुविषयः प्रायेण ससुब्दः प्रसिद्ध इति तद्व्याकरणाभाषापेक्षया मागुत्पतेः सदेव ब्रह्मासदिवासीदित्युपचर्यते&rsquo; and points out that in such passages Sruti itself adds words which give the go-by and resote the words &lsquo;asad-evedam&rsquo; &amp;c. In æg. X, 72.4 (aditer dakso ajāyata ) Prof. Velankar (Pro. of All I. O. Coo ference, 17th Session in 1953 ) bolds &lsquo;aditeh&rsquo; to be in the genitive caso (p. 62) and not in the ablative case, to avoid the riddle bow Dakna and Aditi were boro of each other, but that breaks the symmetry of the words, such as &lsquo;agataḥ&rsquo;. &lsquo;attānapadah&rsquo;, &lsquo;bbuvaḥ&rsquo; tbat precede and are taken as ablatives The present author demurs to this explanation offered by Prof. Velankar.</p>

Rgveda X, 90 (001 taining 16 versus) is the famous hymn called Purusasūkta and postulates a supreme creator as a Puruṣa (called Adipurusa by Sāyaṇa) with a thousand heads, eyes and feet, asports that all this that has come into being and that is yet to come is Purasa, that from Puruṣa arose Virāj, from whom arose ( what we may call the second) Puruṣa (Hiranyagarbha) whom the gods offered as havis (oblation or paśu) in a symbolical sacrifice in which the three seasons, Vasanta, Grisma and Sarad were respectively the ghee, the fuel and the haris. This hymn was probably composed at a time when, it appears, there was a firm belief (as in Śat. Br. V.2.4.7, VI. 1. 1. 3 and Tai. 8. VIL 4.2.1) that nothing great can be accomplished without yajña or tapas. The hymn then proceeds to say that from that primoval yajña all animals (borses, cows &amp;c.), the four varnas, the Sun, the Moon, Agni, Indra, the Veda, heaven and earth were produced. In the Atharvaveda XIX. 6 also there are 16 verses of which the first fifteen correspond with the first 15 verses of the Paruṣasūkta, but the order of verses is different and some of the words also are slightly changed. The Vāj. S. 31 has all the 16 verses of the Prusan sakta but it contains five more verses and a prode passage at the end. Rg. X. 121. 1 declares 2440 that in the beginning Hiranya</p>

<p>garbha (the Golden Egg) was born; and verse 10 identifies him with Prajapati and verses 8 and 10 declare that waters were produced by him from which issues forth Hiranyagarbha (the Golden egg), which was Prajāpati Himself. The second verse is quoted in n. 1410. Rg. X. 125 is a hymn placed in the mouth of Vāk ( speech), wherein speech is portrayed as a power even beyond the gods and as creative. Three (1,6,8) out of the eight verges may be rendered here &lsquo;I move along with the Rudras and Vasus, with the Adityas and Viśyedevas; I support both Mitra and Varupa, Indra and Agni and the two Asvins, I stretch the bow of Rudra in order to kill the enemy, the hater of brahma (sacred prayer); I cause war for mon; I entered heaven and earth, I blow like the wind, producing all the worlds; I am beyond hearen and beyond this earth; by my greatness (power) I have become such a one&rsquo;. Here one must told that the sage is not referring to ordinary speech or language but to the conception that word has creative power and that it is one with God or was the thought uttered by brahman.</p>
<p>Rg. X. 129 (called Nāsadiya-sūkta from the opening words ) is a unique hymn241 Several passages of bis hymn are yet very obscure in spite of the labour bestowed upon it by eminent sobo lars. In this hymn the First Principle of Creator is not given any name but is simply spokon of as&rsquo;tad-ekam&rsquo;, as done in the Upaniṣads in &lsquo;Tat-team-asi&rsquo; or &lsquo;ekam-avādvitiyam&rsquo; (Ohān. Up VI 2.1-2.). The important and tolerably clear passages are translated here : &quot; There was then neither asat&rsquo; ( what is not,</p>

The stay (X. 5, 3, 1-2) makes an interesting refereace to this hymo: &lsquo;मेव वा इदमोऽसदासीव सदासीत् । आसीदिव था इदमये नेवासीचद्ध तन्मन पचास। परमादेतहषिणाम्यनूक्तम् । नासदासीको सदासीत्तदानीमिति। नेव हि सन्मनो नेवासद तदिद Har gen t .&rsquo; This Br, makes it clear that this (Universe) was as it were acither aon-existent nor existent and it further says in the beginning this (Universe) as it were existed and did aot exist: there was then only the mind and that mind as it were was neither existent nor pop•existent.' It may be noted that the Bhagavatapurāṇa speaks of the Lord as importag the esoteric (gubya) Truth in verses 32-36 of II. 9; verse 32 which reme miods us of Rg. X. 129. 1 is: TAROT wage9870 I fear wear</p>

<p>non-being) nor &lsquo;sat&rsquo; (what is); thone was no aky nor the heaven whisk is beyond; what was it that covered all! Where was it and under whose shelter? Was there deep unfathomable abyss of waters?; (2) There was no death, bonne nothing immortal; there was no congoiousness (distinction) of night and day; that one breathed by its own nature (power) without there being any air, really nothing other than that existed ; ( 4 ) destre oame into being, that was the first flow (seed, offspring) of the mind; (6) who knows directly, who can proclaim it here whence this creation came into being; (7) He from whom arose this area tion, whether he made it or did not make it, the Higheat soor in the highest heaven, he indeed knows or even he does not know?</p>
<p>It would be noticed that the sage, who was a poot and philosopher, proclaimed that there was that one Being, raised high above all gods, conditions and limitations; he, the sage, gives expression to what he conceived to be the state before the creation of the universe. Night and day, death and immorta lity are opposites. These exist only when there is manifest ness or creation and therefore he says there was no death, nor anything immortal. The hymn does not say that there was non-being out of which being grow. What he means is that That One alone breathed, the opposites, being and non-being, did not exist. For translations and remarks on this hymn, vide Max-Müller&rsquo;s &lsquo;History of ancient Sanskrit Literature (1859 ) pp. 539-566, and &lsquo;Six systems of Indian Philosophy&rsquo; (1919 ed.) pp. 49-52, Dr. Radhakrishnan&rsquo;s &lsquo;Indian Philosophy&rsquo; (1923), vol. 1. pp. 100-104. Prof. Whitney (Proceedings of American Oriental Society Vol. XI p. OXI.), in his characteristio supercilious manner referred to above on p. 51%, remarked that the praises bestowed on this hymn were nauseating. Deusben, loog after Whitney&rsquo;s diatribe, said &ldquo;in its noble simplicity, in the loftiness of its</p>
<p>philosophic vision, it is possibly the most admirable bit of the</p>
<p>· philosophy of olden times&rsquo; and that no translation can ever do</p>
<p>justice to the beauty of the original' (vide Bloomfield&rsquo;s &lsquo;The religion of the Veda,&rsquo; p. 234, ed. of 1908 ). Vide Keith&rsquo;s &lsquo;Reli gion and philosophy of the Veda and Upanigads.&rsquo; VOL II. pp. 435-436. In many other passages of the Rgveda, different gods are referred to as creators. God Prajāpati is said to have created heaven and earth, the wide, deep, well formed and to have pushed them by his power without support (IV. 56. 3 ). Indra is said to have created the Sun and Uṣas (Rg. II. 12.) and to have established heaven without any beam to support, supported and spread the earth ( Rg. II. 15.% ).</p>
<p>1492</p>
<p>History of Dharmalāstra (Soo. IX, Oh XXXIV</p>
<p>The creation hymns refer to a stage when there was no generally acoepted theory about the origin of the world.- But this much is clear that in the most ancient times, at least some of the Vedic sagos had arrived at the theory that there was only one Principle or Spirit, though called by various names and that it willed to create the world and created it from itself.</p>
<p>Apart from the above-mentioned hymns that may be called creation bymns, the Rgveda contains many references to the creation or the support 3443 of heaven and earth by several gods and also creation of other things. In Rg. X. 89. 4 Indra is said to have made from heaven and earth on all sides as the axle does the wheels. Rg. I. 154. 4 refers to Viṣou who single-handed supports the three, viz. the earth, the heaven (and antariksa) and all the worlds. Mitra is said to support beaven and earth (Rg. LIL, 59. 1) and to bear all gods (Rg. III. 59.8 ) 2413. Brahmanas pati (Lord of Prayer, Bphaspati) is said to have sent forth (blazed ) the births of gods like a blacksmith and that in the primeval times of the gods sat was born from asat. Soma is said (Rg. VI. 47. 4) to have made the width of the earth and the loftiness of the heaven and supported the wide anta. riksa (mid regions) and in Rg. II. 40 (which is addressed jointly to Soma-Pasan) it is said that one of them (Sona) produced all worlds and the other (Pūṣan, the Sun) goos over seeing or marking, the doings of the whole world ( verse 5).</p>
<p>In Rg. VII, 78, 3 dawns (plural) are said to have created the Sun, Yajña and Agai. This is metaphorical, since after each dawn the Sun rises, sacrificial fire is kindled into flames and sacrifice is offered. Ip Rg. I 96.2 Agni is said to be the progenitor of men. In Rg. II. 35.2 (apām napāt, grandson of waters i. e. Agni ) is said to have created all worlds.</p>
<p>Heaven and earth ( as dual divinities) have six hymno addressed to them in the Rg..viz. I, 159-160, 185, IV, 56, VI. 70, VII. 53 ) and they are called &lsquo;rodasi&rsquo; and sisters (Rg. I. 185.5). They are also called parents of the gods ( Rg. VIII. 97.8, X. 2.7).</p>

<p>The word ' antariksa&rsquo; (atmosphorio region) cours at least a hundred times in the Rgveda. Sometimes we have phrases like (tisrah pṣthvih ) meaning the three worlds including the earth (Rg. I. 84, 8), while in other passages reference is made to lower, middle and highest prithivi as in Rg. I. 108. 9 (yad indrā. gni avamasyām prthivyām madhyamasyān paramasyām uta sthaḥ) meaning thereby the earth, antariksa and heaven. Antariksa is often called &lsquo;rajas&rsquo; as the region of dust, mists and clouds</p>
<p>in Rg. I 35.% and 9).</p>
<p>In Rg. I. 35. 6 it is said &lsquo;there are three dyaus (i. e. heaven, antariksa and earth), two are on the lap of Savitr (i. o. heaven and earth) and one (antarikṣa) is in the world of Yama. The sage explains in Rg. &amp; 88. 15 &ldquo;I bave heard of two paths viz. of the pitṛs and of the gods and also of mon; the whole world that moves reaches that (region) which is between the father (heaven) and the mother (the earth).</p>
<p>Varuṇa is said to have spread antariksa on forests, spread the Sun in heaven and Soma on mountains (Rg. V.85.2). Even in the times of the Rgveda speculation had begun about the distance between heaven and earth. In Rg. I. 155.5 the post pays that no one dare soar up to the third step of Viṣṇu (i. e. heaven), not even the birds flying on their winga. In the Altareya Brāhmaṇa the distance between the earth and heaven is put at one thousand days&rsquo; journey for a horse, 2414</p>
<p>In the Taittiriya Samhita Prajapati is frequently mentioned as creating the gods and asuras (IIL 3. 7. 1), as creating yajfias (1 6.9.1), da creating people (II. 1. 2. 1) and animals (1. 5.9.7) and desiring to create prajā and performing tapas for that (III. 1.1.1). Tai. 8. (V. 6. 4.2) states that all this is the beginning was water, a sea and that Prajāpati becoming wind floated rapidly on &amp; lotus leaf.</p>
<p>The Atharvaveda has some hymns on creation. But they are verbose, repetitive and do not possess the depth, philosophy and torse style of the hymns of the Reveda cited above. In hymns 7 and 8 of the 10th kanda it puts forward Skambha as the base and as identified with Prajāpati, as the creator and supporter of all worlds and as having all the thirty-three gods in himself; it asks by how muoh did Skambha enter the manifold</p>

IX. 86. 46 Soma made for sacrifice is spoken of as Skambha. Hymn 8 of kāṇda X (of Atharvavada) in styled * description of Jyestha-brahma&rsquo; (the highest or oldest brahma). Two Verses from it may be cited &lsquo;Obeisance to that Jyestha Brahma that governs all, whether produced or to be produced, and to whom alone heaven pertains. These two, heaven and earth, stand supported by Skambha; all this that has Atman, that breathes and blinks is Skambha. Skambha literally means *support&rsquo; or &lsquo;pillar&rsquo;. The verbal form Skabbnāti' occurs in Rg X. 6. 3 and the word &lsquo;Skambha&rsquo; occurs several times in the Rg, but not in the sense of &lsquo;creator&rsquo;. In Atharva X. 8. 2 Skambha is mentioned twice, while in X. 72445 (of 44 verses) it occurs many times. Atharva X. 2 is called Brahmaprakāśana hymn (of 33 verses). Numerous questions are asked in verses one to 19. In verses 20, 22, 24 questions are asked and verses 21, 23, 25 giro replies to them. One question and answer may be set out &lsquo;By whom was this earth made (or arranged), by whom was the high beaven placed, by whom was the sky placed above and crosswise and in various directions&rsquo;? &lsquo;Brahma made the earth, brahma is the heaven placed high, it is brahma Shat is the sky placed above, Cross-wise and in various directions.&rsquo; Verse 27 of Atharva X. 8 ia the same as Sv.Up.

In Atharva IX. 2 ( 25 Verses) there is apotheosis of Kāma, in the first eighteen verses of which there are prayers to Kama for vanquishing and driving away enemies, the last quarter of each of the perses 19 to 24 ends tasmai te Kama nama it krpomi (I offer obeisance to you, O Kāma').

Tapas is placed in Kāla, also the Jyestha Brahma, Kāla is the Lord of all, he was the father of Prajāpati; Kāla created people, in the begin. ning Kāla created Prajāpati, Svayambhū (Brahmā), Kasyapa and tapas sprang from Kāla; from Kāla were born waters, brahma, tapas and directions, sun-rise is due to Kāla and it is merged in Kāla (at night).'</p>
<p>The Sat. Br. in many places speaks of creation. A few passages only can be referred to here. The Sat. Br. (in VI. 1. 1) starts by saying that in the beginning there was here the non-existent' and assorts that the non-existent was the sages, the vital airs and then it postulates Prajapati (made from seven vital airs) who desired “May I be more, may I have progeny'. *He toiled and practised tapas, and being tired, he created first of all the Brahman, the triple lore (the three Vedas), that Prajā pati then created waters from Vāk that is the world; that he (Prajāpati) entered the waters with the triple love and that thende an egg arose; he touched it, then earth was produced and so on.</p>
<p>In XI. 1. 6. 1 ff. the Sat. Br. states &ldquo;In the beginning this was water, only a 808. The waters desired &lsquo;How shall we have</p>

<p>progeny?&rsquo; They toiled and practised austerities; while they were doing this a golden egg was produced, which floated for about a year, in about a year&rsquo;s time a Puruṣa, Prajāpati, was born; he broke open the egg; he created the Gods by (the breath of) his mouth; he created Agai, Indra, Soma &quot; &amp;o.</p>
<p>In XI. 2. 3. 1-2 the Sat. Br, says-In the beginning this (universe) was brahma, it created the gods, Agni, Vāyu, Sūrya ; then &amp; reference is made to name and form (nāma rūpe) by which he descends into the worlds and it is said these two (nāmarūpe ) are the great manifestations of brahma'.</p>
<p>This myth about a golden egg of the universe is developed from Rg. X. 129. 3 and X. 121.1 (Hiranyagarbhaḥ sama vartatāgre) in the Ch. Up. III. 19. 1-2 &lsquo;In the beginning this universe was asat (not unfolded), it became sat (began to unfold), it was born (i, e. it took form); then an egg was evolved; it lay (in waters) for the period of a year; then it broke up, the two halves were one of silver and the other of gold; the silver half is this earth and the golden half is heaven&rsquo;. This is followed in Manusmrti as will be ghown later on.</p>
<p>It is stated in the Sat. Br. X. 4. 2. 22–23 that Prajapati arranged the Rgveda in such a way that the number of syllables in the Rgveda come to 12000 Bṛhati metres (each Bphati has 36 syllables ).</p>
<p>The Tai, Br. states &ldquo;Prajapati created Gods and aduras (II. 2. 3) but he did not create Indra; the Gods said to him * create Indra for us'; just as I created you by means of fupag in the same way you create Indra; they practised tapas and they saw Indra ( abiding) in themselves (i.e. in their hearts) they said to him be born'&rdquo;. In II. %. 9. 1 the Tai.2447 Br. statas &ldquo;this universe was nothing at all in the beginning; there was no heaven por earth nor mid region; that non-existent created Mind with the thought &lsquo;let me be&rsquo;&rdquo;. In II. 6. 2. 3 the same Brāhmaṇa says &ldquo;Prajapati created by the help of Veda the two forms &lsquo;sat&rsquo; and &lsquo;asat&rdquo;. The Tai. Br. in II. 8. 8. 9-10 oites as Puronuyākyā and Yājyā of purodāsa and puronuvākyā of &lsquo;havis&rsquo; 88 follows: Brahma produced the Gods and all this world;</p>

<p>Creation from braku</p>

<p>the kṣatriyas were produced from brahman and brahma tant formed its form into brahmanas; (Yaya) &lsquo;these worlds abida inside brahman, similarly all this world is inside it; brabma is the best among all bhūtas; who vie or compate with it, brahman is thirty-three Gods, and all bhūtas, all placed inside it as in a boat&rsquo;.</p>
<p>In the Kausitaki Brāhmana there are brief allusions to Prajāpati. In VI, 1 it is stated Prajāpati, desirons of progeny, practised tapas; while he was thus practising tapas five were born, viz. Agoi, Vāyu, Aditya, the Moon and Uṣas as fifth;&rsquo; in VI, 10 it is said &lsquo;Prajapati practised tapas; after haviog practised tapas, he produced this world (the earth) from prāna, the mid regions from a pān and the yonder world i beaven) from vyāna; he then created Agni, Vayu and Aditya respectively from the eartb, mid regions and heaven, and he produced ik Verses from Agni, yajus texts from Vāyu and sāman taxts from Aditya; in XIII. 1 it is assarted &lsquo;Prajāpati is indeed yajian in which al desires, all immortality are centered&rsquo;; in XXVII. 1 it is said &lsquo;Prajapati created yajña, the gods worshipped by means of yajāa, when it was created and thereby obtained all desired objects.&lsquo;2148</p>
<p>The chief aim and purpose of the Brāhmaṇas of the Veda are to prescribe the acts and parts of the ritual of various sacrifices, to set out some myths and legends for their origin and to postulate various towards on the performance of nume Tous sacrifices.</p>
<p>Prajāpati, who is mentioned very rarely in the Rgveda (IV. 53, 2 where Savity is called Prajāpati, IX. 5.9 where Soma is called Prajāpati, X. 85. 4 where in the marriage hymn Praja pati is prayed to bestow offspring, X. 169. 4 where Prajāpati is invoked to bestow good cows, X. 184. 1 whers Prajāpati along with other gods and goddesses is invoked for the blessing of cod ception in a married woman, X. 121. 10 (already referred to above on p. 1490), becomes the most prominent god in the Brahmanag. The Ait, Br, narrates the story that after Indra killad Vitra he wanted to be great and honoured in place of Prajapati, that then Prajāpati said (if you are to be great) &lsquo;who am I going</p>

<p>The Ait Br. states that Prajapati desiring to propagate and to be many and having practised tapas created the three worlda, earth, mid region and heaven from which arose three lights (jyotis), Agni, Vāyu and Aditya, from which arose the three Vedas &amp;c.</p>
<p>The Vedic Sambitās and Brahmaṇas show that the popular belief about the individual self was that by good deeds the soul reaches heaven, becomes immortal and enjoys various joys and pleasures. Vide Rg, IX. 113, 7-11, I. 125. 4-6, Atharva IV. 34. 2 and 5, VI. 120. 3. There was also the idea of retribution and recompense for evil or harmful acts done by one person to another. For example, the Sat Br. says (XII. 9. 1. 1) &lsquo;for what ever food a man eats in this world,. by the very same is he eaten again in the other world. Vide also Sat. Br. XI. 6.1. But when we come to the Upanisada, the whole intellectual atmosphere is changed. The Upaniṣads frequently assert that Atman is the only reality, that there is nothing else and that the Alman can only be described as &lsquo;not this-not this&rsquo; i. e. the Atman is un knowable. This is the first and foremost aspect of Vedānta. But this lofty inetaphysical conception clashed with the ideas of common people who thought that a real universa existed apart from the Creator. The higher philosophic minds had to concede the reality of the universe for common people. They were prepared to say that the universe exists; in truth, however, it is nothing but the Atman entered into the universe. They said that the world was phenomenal, not false or nothing, but the world bad the Atman behind it. This was the good aspect of the Vedānta viz. that the universe evolved from the first principle, brahma. They distinguished between saguna (quali fied) brahman that was for prayer and worship (upāsana ), and for practical purposes (vyavahārāvastha) and nirgura (un qualified) brahma. But the higher thought also insisted that the highest truth (pāramārtbikasatya ) is that brahman is one, that everything in the world ( mon, animals, inorganic matter)</p>

The last part of this passage is the ruler within is unseen but seeing, unheard but hearing, unperceived but perceiving, unknown but knowins, there is no other seer but he, there is no other hearer but he, that is no other perceiver but he, there is no other knower but he.

<p>History of Dharmadāstra (Soo. IX, On. XXXIV</p>
<p>antaryāmi-brāhmaṇa has a parallel in Bṛ. Up. II. 5 (Madhu vidyā). The ordinary man&rsquo;s conception of brahman as the creator was not, however, entirely given up by the thinkers in the Upaniṣads, though it was said that that concept was due to avidyā (ignorance about Reality). Brahman conceived as creator was called Iśvara (a personal God), though the worshipper might know that brahman in essence is above all conditions and limitations of personality. This is theism, which acknowledges three entities viz. a real world, the Paramātman (creative Ātman) and the individual self dependent on Paramātman. But the real thought of the Upaniṣads is centred round the non-difference of brahman and atman and the plıysical world. This thought that brahman entered into what are called individual souls and also the material universe is the third aspect of Vedānta. On V. S II, 3. 43 Saṅkarācārya quotes passages from the Brahma sūkta belonging to the Atharvaveda 2452 and from the Sv. Up. expressive of the identity with brahmin of fishermen, slaveg, gamblers, of men and women, of boys and girls and old men tottering on a staff. The faith that the same Spirit animates the universe, from the stone, worms and beasts to man, is an elevating one, may make one feel that all creatures are brethren seeking the Creator and may, in a world dominated by egoism and urged to activities for individual prosperity and benefit, introduce some sweetness and consolation. Deussen in The philosophy of the Upanishada&rsquo; (translated by A. S. Geden, Edinburgh, 1906) pays a glowing tribute to the sages of the Upanishads in the following eloquent passage &lsquo;It was horo that for the first time the original thinkers of the Upanishads, to their immortal honour, found it (key) when they recognized our atman, our inmost individual being, as the Brahman, the inmost being of universal nature and of all her phenomena (p. 40). Vide also J. Royce in &lsquo;The world and the individual&rsquo;, First series of Lectures, particularly pp. 156-175 for the exposition of Chān. Up. III, 14 and VI. 2-15 and the Bṭ, Up. dialogue between Yāj. and Maitreyi</p>

<p>Upani ṣad passages on creation</p>
<p>1501</p>
<p>about creation. The Bṛ. Up. I. 4 (in 3-4,7) has an original and significant passage on creation. Some part of it is set out here *In the beginning this was Atman alone in the form of Puruṣa ; He ( being alone ) found no pleasure; he desired to have a second (a companion); he became of the extent of a male and a female in close embrace; he made this very Atman fall aside in two parts that became husband and wife; from them were born men and he produced lower animals up to ants; this (universe) was then undeveloped (or not unfolded), it was then developed in names and forms; that (Ātman) entered into this up to the finger tips, just as a razor remains hidden in a sheath or just as the all supporting (fire) is not soon in wood&rsquo;. In this passage the popular idea of the creation of the world is taken up and related to the one reality, Ātman, and the emphasis appears to be placed on the theory that the sole reality is Ātman, under the phantas. magoria of world phenomena. In Ch. Up. VII, 10.1 it is said</p>
<p>this earth, mid regions, heaven, gods and mon, boasts and birds. grass and herbs, animals including insects, butterflies, ants, These are all nothing but waters in solid form.&rsquo; The Chan. Up. (VI. 2. 3–4 and VI. 3. 2-3) states &quot; in the beginning Sat alone was existent, one without a second; it thought &lsquo;I shall become many, I shall have progeny&rdquo;; it created boat (tojas); from tejas waters were produced, from water food; that divinity proposed &lsquo;I shall enter into these three divinities (heat, water and food) with this living self and unfold name and form. Here reference is made to three elements only viz. teias, water, and earth (anna is produced from plants which spring from the earth). It is not, however, proper to hold that only three were then recognized, these three were the most obvious and the other two Vāyu and Akasa mentioned in Ait. and Tai. Up. are elusive. The Ait, Up. (quoted in note 2451) begins &ldquo;In the beginning there was here this Ātman alone, there was nothing else that was active (lit. that opened and closed eyes); He reflected&rsquo; I shall create worlds&rsquo;. He created these worlds, the ambhas (water above heaven), marloi &lsquo;rays&rsquo; (i. e.) atmospheric region, death, waters&rdquo;. Then the Up. proceeds: He created guardians of worlds and proposed to produce food for them. Then he reflected &lsquo;how can this frame subsist apart from me? Then he reflected by what way shall I enter into it ?&rsquo; Then it is stated that he split open the crown of the head and entered by that door. The Tai. Up. II. 6 says &ldquo;Ho (the Atman) desired “May I become many, I shall bave progony&rsquo;; having practised tapas, he created all this (universe) whatever it is; after having created it he</p>
<p>1502</p>
<p>History of Dharmadāstra (Soo. IX, Ch. XXXIV</p>
<p>entered into it&rdquo; and again in II. 7 &lsquo;in the beginning this was asat (not unfolded), then it became sat (developed), it unfolded itself&rsquo;. This is the basis of V.S. I. 4.26 (atmakrteh pariṇāmāt) which establishes that brahman is both karls (agent) and karma (object) of creation. The same Up. in II. 1 speaks of the creation of akāśa from the Ātman, of Vāyu from ākāśa, of Agni from Vāyu, of waters from Agni and of the earth from waters. Here we have five elements instead of three (as in the Chan. Up.). The Ait. Up. III. 3 names the five elements and calls them Mahābhūtāni (though the usual order is not followed ); so do Praśna VI. 4, Sv. Up. II. 12, Katha III, 15 (where the five gupas, sabda, sparsa, rūpa, rasa and gandha, each paouliar to the five elements frota ākāśa to prthvi, are mentioned ). 2453</p>
<ol start="2453">
<li>Prof. George Sarton in A History of Science&rsquo; (Harvard Uairersity Press, 1952) states (p. 247) that Empedocles born about 490 B, C. (in Greece) postulated only four elements ; fire, air, water and earth and that a fifth, ether, was added by Plato and Aristotle. Vide also latrod. uction (p. 11) to Plato&rsquo;s Timaeus (in Loeb&rsquo;s classical library, Vol. VII, ed. of 1952 ) translated by Rev. R. G. Bury. Plato&rsquo;s exuberant imagination constructed the physical world on the pattern of geometrical figures most familiar to bid and assigned the cabe to earth and different kiods of triangles to Gre, air and water (vide Jowett&rsquo;s translation of Timaeus, Vol. III pp. 638-639). The Greek philosophers relied on reason and aot on ancient texts (as Indian sages did ) and Plato&rsquo;s philosophy and cosmology ware looked upon as the acme of wisdom even up to the 19th century, but Sarton (on p. 420 of the above work) remarks that modern men of science can regard it only as a monument of powisdom and recklessn058 (rathor a harsh judgment). Dr. W.M. Smart in ' Origin of the Earth remarks tbat in probing into the mystery of creation science has not been more succes. sful than tbe poetic Hebrew expounders of cosmology (pp. 8–9).

Fleure pp. 6–8 (Oxford, 1927); Os p. 7 there is a figure of a Babylonian tablet recording part of the creation story. On p. 56 it states that the probable place of the origin of mao and the period at which human story began are matters of great speculation, The principal qaestions that arise in cosmology are: (1) when were the earth and planets produced, (2) what is the process that accounts for the present state of the earth and the solar and other systems. Sanskrit works from the Rgveda down to the Purana tried to answer these questions in their own ways. Duriag the last one hundred years or so the theories of Lemaitre and Darwin and the develop ments in the sciences of Geology, Biology. Physics and Astronomy have revolutionized the whole conception of cosmology. Even the work of Sir A, Eddington &ldquo;The expanding UDIYork' (Cambridge, 1933) bna become</p>

<p>Dissolution of blitas</p>
<p>1503</p>
<p>It has already been shown that in the Tai. Up. and the Chān. Up. (vide note 2430) it is stated that the bhūtas spring from and are absorbed in brahman. The order of dissolution is the reverse of that of creation. This is stated by the Vedāntasūtra II, 3.14 (&lsquo;viparyayena tu Icramosta upapadyate ca&rsquo;). Saṅkarācārya in his bbāsya quotes a verse of the Sāntiparva in support of this. 2454</p>
<p>The theory of yugas, mahāyugas, manyantaras and kalpas has already been dealt with in vol. III. pp. 885-896 and above pp. 686-692. The dissolution of the world was called pralaya which was said to be of four kinds (vide above pp. 693–95), two of which are naimittika pralayz (which occurs at the end of a day of Brahma, that is equal to 1000 mahāyugas) and Praktika (when everything including Praksti ia dissolved in Paramātman). The Gita (VIII. 17-18) and Manu I. 73 state that the day of Brahma is equal to one thousand yugas and the night is also of the same duration, that all manifested things spring from the unmanifested (First Principle) at the beginning of the day (of Brahma) and at the coming of the night ( of Brahma) they merge in the same unmanifested (Principle). The present author does not like the disagreeable task of comparing Sanskrit cosmology with the theories in other religious soriptures such as the Bible, but will only refer to some Western writers on that subject. About these ideas of creation and dissolution of the universe René Grousset in the work mentioned above observes (p. 96) &ldquo;the same power of synthesis appears in the ancient Indian cosmogonies which tradscend in their breadth all that the Ionian philosophers or Lucretius have left us.

But from what little he has read in a few scientific works he may say that tbe history of science makes it clear that the actual state of man&rsquo;s scientific knowledge is provisional, that scientific theories are always subject to corrections and modifications. For instance, Newton&rsquo;s laws of motion were regarded for over two hundred years 26 absola tely correct enunciations of fundamental and universal laws of physics, but in recent times they have been foond to bo mere approximations.</p>

Similarly, Gerald Heard remarks (in • Is God evident&rsquo; Faber and Faber, London, 1950) *Final and most helpful fact is that Sanskrit Cosmology not only gets rid of intellectual difficulties such as the crude Hebrew Geology and Astronomy fossilized in the Christian dogmas, but it gets rid likewise of those more serious moral difficulties such as eternal damnation, pre-destination and that this life is man&rsquo;s only chance' (p. 51).</p>
<p>The bigh metaphysical conception that in reality there is no universo outside truhman (i. e. brahman is one and is unqualified, nirguna) and the popular empirical conception that there is a personal God who creates (saguna brahma) and real universe, often run together in the Upanisads. The Praśna Op. V. 2 asserts that Om is both para (highest) brahma and apara (other, lower) brahma. Saṅkarācārya on V. S. l. 1. 12 (abandamayosbhyasat) states that in the Upaniṣads brahman is described in two ways, (firstly) as qualified by various adjuncts such as name and form and created objects and meant to be worshipped and (secondly) as devoid of all adjuncts (as meant to be niystically realized). As instances of the 2nd way (niru pūdhiku or nirgunui brahman) he instances several passages viz. Br. Up. IV.5. 15 (“where there is ag it were duality, there one sees the otber &hellip; &hellip; One touches the other or knows the other, but where one has come to realize that all is only Atman, whom will one see, with what will one understand the knower himself'), Br. Up. III. 9. 26 = IV, 4. 22 and IV. 5. 15 (this self is to be spoken of as &lsquo;not tbis, &lsquo;not this&rsquo;), Br. Up. III, 8. 8 (it is that imperishable one that the brāhmaṇas speak about as neither coarse nor small, neither short nor long, neither red nor fluid, neither wind nor ether&hellip; neither as having an inside nor outside &amp;c.); Chān. Up. (VII, 24.1 &lsquo;where one sees nothing else, hears nothing else, understands nothing else that is the Infnite; where one sees something else, hears something else, understands gomething else, that is small (finito); the Infinite is immortal, the finite is mortal; the Infinite rests in its own greatness, or does not rest in greatness ); Sv. Up. VI, 19 (who is without parts, without activities, tranquil, faultless, without taint, the highest bridge to immortality, like a fire that has consumed its fuel). There are also other passages of the same import e. &amp;. Bļ, Up IV. 4. 19 (neha nānāsti kiīcana, there is no diversity in it), Katha Up. IV. 10–11 (mṛtyoh se martyum-āpnobi ya tha naneva</p>

<p>paśyati). The 4th aspect of Upaniṣadio thought is concerned with the desting of the self after the death of the body and the matters that govern it (i, e. Ethics and Eschatology).</p>
<p>These passages emphasize that it is impossible to desoribe what brahman is and that we can only say what it is not. Saṅkarācārya 2455 on V. S. III, 2. 17 refers to the dialogue of Bāṣkali and Badhya where Badhva declared the characteristic of brahman by his silence. Baṣkali said &lsquo;Sir, tell me about brahma&rsquo;; then Badhva remained silent; when Baṣkali asked a second and a third time Bādhya replied we have been telling you indeed; but you don&rsquo;t understand; this self is still (without any activity ). J. Royce in the world and the individual&rsquo; vol I. p. 148 is just like this episode of Baṣkali and Badhya &ldquo;Believe not those prattlers&rsquo; says one often quoted mystical work &lsquo;who boast that they know God.&rsquo; ,Who knows Him is silent&rdquo;. Saṅkarācārya puts the distinction between para-brahma and apara-brahma (personal God) as follows: Where texts reject the connection of brahma with names and forms that are the product of avidya (nescience) and speak of brahma in negative expressions such as asthūla' (not gross or big ), there it is parabrahma (that is meant), but where in such passages as &lsquo;He is mind, has prāṇa or body, the form of light, whose thoughts are true, whose nature is like akasa (present everywhere), who creates everything&rsquo; &amp;c. brahma is mentioned for worship and it is apara. 3456</p>

<p>History of Dharmasāstra (Sec. IX, Oh. XXXIV</p>
<p>The description of the creation of the universe and its disso lution are valid only on the practical plane. In Advaita Vedānta, Satta (roality ) is said to be of three kinds, viz. Pāramārthiki (the highest, the absolute), vyāvahāriki (of practical life) and pratibhāsiki (apparent or illusory). The first is the province of parā-vidyā which teaches that only the Ātman exists, that the cosmos exists within the Ātman and nothing else has intrinsic reality apart from it. From this high metaphysical standpoint there is in reality no creation nor dissolution, the individual self is not really in bondage, therefore none is liberated. The 2nd kind of reality is empirical and practical and the dogmas of the creation and dissolution of the world, of the individual self, its bondage, transmigaration and final liberation are valid only for the aparā-vidyā. Most religions postulate three fundamental entities viz God, individual self and the external world. These three are true but only up to a certain limit (only so long as a man holds his own ego as &amp; separate reality) but these three are not the ultimate Truth. Even in this lower kind of reality, a man who is in deep sleep becomes (for a time) united with (or absorbed in the True, as stated by the Chān, Up. VI. 8. 1 (yatraitat puruṣaḥ svapiti nāma satā somya tada gampanno bhavati). The third kind of reality pertains to dream state, One may have experience of pleasure and pain and misery from what one sees in a dream, which are real as long as the dream lasts, but all this that is seen in a dream vanishes the moment the man is awake. As stated above (p. 1485 and note 2434) the descriptions of the creation of the world have only this in view that there is non-difference between cause and effect and that they all lead to a correct understanding about brahman. Saṅkarācārya on V. s. II. 3. 30 extends the same reasoning to individual selves (to be quoted later on under &ldquo;Karma and transmigration').</p>
<p>In the Upaniṣads there is apparent discrepancy as regards what was created and the order of the things 2457 created. The</p>

<li>It may be aoted that the creation of tbe universe is put in the Upanisads in the distant and dim past, oot at a definite date as fixed by Biblical chronology ( 4004 B. C.). Vide Pringle-Pattison in Idea of God (ed, of 1917) p. 299: H, D. Anthony in Science and its background&rdquo; (MacMillan, 1948, p. 2) states that James Ussher, Archbishop of Armagh, in the 17th century introduced into the Anglican Church the year 4004 B.C. as the date of creation. On the medieval Christian doctrine, creation is only an incident in God&rsquo;s existence and man is made in the image of God and it is by the breath of God that man became a living soul (Genesis I. 27 and II. 7). There is another point that distinguisbes Christian doctrine about man from the Vedānta doctrine; &lsquo;According to the former man is concelved and born in sin, according to the latter the human soul in divino. :</li>

<p>Upanigad passages on brahman</p>
<p>1507</p>
<p>Bṭ. Up. (V. 5.1) states in the beginning there were only wator&rsquo;s; the waters oreated satya, which is brahma, brahman created Prajāpati, who created the gods&rsquo;. In Chān. Up. VI. 2. 3 the thing expressly mentioned as the first creation is teias (heat), akāśa not being mentioned at all, while in the Tai. Up. II. 1 ākāga is said to have been first created and then Vāyu (was created from akāśa), then Agni from Vāyu. Similarly, in the Ohān. Up. IV.% where the creation of tejas, waters and food (i. e, the earth ) is expressly mentioned, nothing is said about the creation of Vāyu, which is set out in Tai. Up. II. I. This matter about the creation of the elements and their order is discussed in V. 8. II. 3. 1-11. The reply of Saṅkarācārya is that a śruti passage like the one in Ch. Up. is concerned only with the creation of some elements like tejas and cannot be also interpreted as having a second purpose, viz. showing that the creation of akāśa in Tai, Up. is wrong and should be discarded. 2458</p>
<p>On the subject of creation, the question arises whether the individual Self is also a creation like that of the earth, trees and shrubs. The Upaniṣads have a good deal to say on this. Here also two kinds of texts have to be considered. In the first place, some texts seem to state that the individual selves spring from the Supreme Spirit. A few passages that are sometimes relied upon for this last matter may be cited here. 2459 The Br. Up. states just as tiny sparks spring forth from fire, in the same way from this Atman spring up all prānas, all worlds, all gods and all creatures'. The Mundaka Up. expands this game idea as follows: As from a well-kindled fro sparks of the same nature spring forth in thousands, so from the Imperishable various living beings issue and return into it. The Smrti of Yāj. oites the same illustration of fire and sparks. Another and perhaps apter illustration is in the Katha Up..just as pure water poured in (other) pure water becomes like it (i. e. not distingui</p>

<p>sbable), so the self of the wise sage becomes (indistinguishable from the Supreme Essence). On the other hand, there are aumerous Upanisad 2460 passages which categorically state that the individual self is unborn, uniying, is not a product, that the Supreme Spirit enters as individual self, that there is non difference between the one Supreme Spirit and the individual self. Some of these passages are set out in the note below. All those passages are cited by Saṅkaracarya on v. S. II. 3. 17, which states two propositions viz. the individual self is upproduced and that it is eternal according to Sruti passages (natmasruter-nityatvacca tābhyah). How the one Supreme Spirit expands into and pervades the manifold universe of plurality is a great mystery and can only be explained by illustrations. The few passages in which the texts seem to mention the creation or dissolution of individual selves are to be understood as referring to the Upādhis (such as body and mind) by which the self is affected. Yājñavalkya gives this answer in finally winding up his exposition to Maitreyi2462 &lsquo;this self is imperishable and indestructible; but (when one speaks of death what is meant is) that the self has no longer any contact with material elements&rsquo;. The śāntiparva 2462 and the Gitā (II. 20,21,24,25) say the same thing.</p>
<p>The highest metaphysical standpoint can be realized by only a few. For millions of men, the empirical standpoint alone remains and it is for them that texts speak of a personal God, ritual and sacrifices; they are only on the first rung of the ladder</p>

<p>to enlightenment and are only dimly aware of God; there is a much smaller class of people other than the preceding, who pray, seek God and come to realize that God is both immanent and transcendent; there is a third class of a very few people, the great sages and masters, the spiritual elite such as Saṅkarā cārya. who reach the peak of pure monism, who lose tine sense of the ego and who are ripe for entering into union with the One and they cannot and should not say that the individual soul and the physical world are all unreal (or Māyā). Both Bādarāyaṇa (V. S. II. 2. 29. Vaidharmyāo-ca na syapnādivat') and Saṅkarācārya are agreed that the ordinary physical world is entirely different from dreams and that the impressions in the waking state are not independent of existing objects. Apart from the question whether the word &lsquo;Māya&rsquo; used in V, 8, IT, 2. 3(Māyāmātram tu &amp;c.) is used by Bādarāyana in the sense in which Saṅkarācārya understands it, it cannot be denied that Upaniṣad passages like Katha Up. II. 4.2, Praśna 1,16, Chān. Up. VIII, 3. 1-2, the prayer in Bṛ. Up. I. 3. 28 ( asato mā sadgamaya &amp;c) could easily suggest the dootrine of Māyā and load to it as an intelligible development. Hence the proper language for almost all man is not to speak about the world 20 Māyā (illusion ). If the individual soul and the world are unreal, then it may be argued by one who does not subscribe to the doctrine of Māyā as against those who hold it that you are teaching that an unreal soul has to escape from an unreal Samsāra and secure what you call moksa by means which are themselves unreal (such as Upaniṣad study) and that therefore moksa itself is unreal. How the one Reality becomes many and expresses itself in the ever-changing physical world is really an inexplicable mystery, but that does not entitle all of us to say that the world is unreal or a dream. The few highly philosophioal men may say that what is roal is the one Absolute, that all else is only an appearance of that Absolute, Common men may, however, complain that explanations offered by thege philosophers do not satisfy them or are beyond them.</p>
<p>When one has to emphasize what the Reality behind the world is in itself, one speaks of the Absolute brahman, but when one has to speak about the relation of the one Reality to the individual selves and the physical world one speaks of a personal God.

<p>world is non-different (ananya) from brahman, what is meant to not that the two are identical, but only this that the golves and the world are not entirely different from brahman. When it is said that Moksa results if one realizes brahman, there is no question of the destruction of the world but all that it comes to is that the false idea of outlook in that case is displaced or sublated by a true one. How the finite world arises from the Infinite is a mystery, for which Saṅkarācārya employs the word * Māsā'. But he is positive that till a person realizes the one Ātman all religious and worldly courses of life, real-upreal, go on unobstructed. The concept of Maya as postulated by Saṅkarācārya (on V. S. IL 1. 14 and other places) is one of the most misunderstood elements of Vedānta. Further, it should not be forgotten that a very large number of philosophically minded Hindus do not advocate the doctrine that the world is an illusion; all that is said by advaiting is that the world is not as real as the Absolute is. The passages quoted below from Saṅkarādārya&rsquo;s Bhāsya clarify his position, which is this. There is the physioal world with its manifold distinctions, but it must rest on some thing else; that something is called the absolute brahman. The relation between the two is inexplicable and therefore it is spoken of as Mayā. In that way Sapkarācārya is agnostia, while other religious philosophers are not willing to admit the futility of theories or their helplessness to put forward a generally acceptable and reasonable theory of the relation of the universe and the Eternal Spirit behind it.</p>
<p>It should pot be forgotten that, according to our sāstras the goals of human life are four, Dharma (an ethical life of doing what is right), Artha (a life of acquisition of wealth i. 8. economic life based on justice), Kāma (a life of the enjoyment of innocent pleasures and right desires) and Mokṣa (liberation), this last being the highest goal to be attained only by a few people ( it is called Paramapuruṣārtha).

Vide also Rg. VII. 66. 16. The Manusmrti, after referring to several views about the number of the goals of human life, states its own final conclusion (in II, 224) that there are three goals4655 (Dharma, Artha and Kāma) for all men and condemns premature resort to sannyada in the following words (VI. 36-37) “Having studied the Vedas as laid down in śāstras, having produced sons and having porformed sacrifices according to one&rsquo;s ability, one should fix his mind on Mokṣu (liberation); if a man desires Mokṣa without having performed these duties he falls into hell. Manu emphasizes that a man must discharge his duties (i. e. pay off the three debts) as laid down in Tai. S. VI, 3. 10.5 (quoted in H. of Dh, vol. II. p. 270 n. 621 ) before he can renounce the world. The experience of sexual life and other pleasures not opposed to righteousness was not condemned by Manu and other Sāstras and in the Bhagavadgita (VII. 11) Lord Krona identifies himself with Kāma that is not in opposition to righteousness, In the three goals 2466 of ordinary human life there is bardly anything that should cause surprise. The Gita demands a life dedicated to active work and regards doing one&rsquo;s duty as worship (III. 8, 19, 20, 25, IV. 18, XVIII. 65-66). The 4th goal (mokṣa) is in a way opposed to the first three. But the first three goals enable a man to attain liberation, after he has discharged his duties. It was not meant for everybody but only for a selected fow.</p>

<p>as preparation (Bṭ. Up. IV. 4. 22). Because the Upaniṣads often employ the words “ Brahma veda brahmaiva bhayati&rdquo; (as in Mundaka III 2.9) one should not run away with the idea that mere knowledge of brahma (from books or a teacher) is enough. Though the verb &ldquo;vid&rdquo; (to know) is employed, the Upaniṣads are emphatic that before one attains realization of brahma one must have lived a life of delachment, peace, self restraint etc. For example, in Bṛ, Up. IV. 4. 23 Yājñavalkya saya to Janaka &ldquo;Therefore, one who knows this (under tarka quoted above p. 1478) evil does not overcome him, he overcomes all evil and hence he becomes free from evil, free from rajas (desires), free from doubts, he becomes a (true) Brābmana. This is the Brahma-world. O king! you have been made to reach the world. So said Yājñavalkya.&rdquo; This passage clearly emphasizes three stages, firstly, verbal knowledge about brahma (evam-vid), secondly he becomes śānta, dānta &amp;c., thirdly, he realizes the non-difference of himself and the world from the Supreme Self. In this text the indeclinable past participle 1467 (bhūtyā ) in &ldquo;tvā', acc. to. Pāṇini III. 4. 21, is used and so clearly conveys that (as Sanskrit grammar and usage require), in order that a person may realize the Self in his own self, he must have been already endowed with all that precedes the word &quot; bhūtyā&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Similarly, in the Mundakopaniṣad it is provided 24675 After carefully examining all the worlds that are collected (gained or brought about) by actions, a brābmana should reach &amp; sense of disgust or disregard with the thought that by actions (which are all impermanent) nothing that is imperishable (lit, unmade) can be attained, he should, for the special understanding of that, approach with fuel in hand a teacher who is learned in the Veda and who solely dwells in brahman, that wise (guru) declared brahma-vidyā to the one who thus properly (respectfully) app roaches and whose mind is quiescent (not perturbed by vanity &amp;c.) and whose mind has ceased to hanker after objeots of sense, whereby the disciple would realize the immutable Reality, the Puruṣa (Self ).'

<p>Moral preparation for brahmavid</p>
<p>1513</p>
<p>brahmavidyā can be attained only by him who already has become tired of the world of senges. It is further provided that 2468 when a man becomes freed from all hankerings that cling to the heart of man, he becomes immortal and attaing brahma in this very life. The Br. Up.(iv. 4. 6) states that of him who does not desire, who, not desiring, is freed from desires, who feels that he has obtained all desires in that he desires only the Self, the life breaths do not depart towards higher worlds (heaven eto.) as he, being (in reality ) brahma only, becomes absorbed in brahma.</p>
<p>The Katha Up. (2. 24) remarks &lsquo;He, who had not ceased from evil conduot, whose mind is not serene, who does not pra ctise concentration, would not be able by mere knowledge to find the Ātman.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The unalloyed Upanisad doctrine appears to be that, even when a man does good actions, they produce good results, to enjoy which the soul would have to undergo the bondage of fresh good births and thus liberation will be put off. Therefore, complete renunciation of all actions and their rewards was in culcated for the sannyāsin, who was to give up all desires for wealth, progeny and higher worlds and beg for alms as long as the body lasts. As no other course of conduot for the sannyāsin is specified here, it would have to be deemed that the Upaniṣad teaches only this mode of life for the sannyasin. This view is further strengthened by other passages of the Upaniṣads, where it is said that the liberated are beyond sukrta ( good deeds and their consequences) and duskrta (evil deeds and their consequences). The Chandgoya says 2469 &quot; the self is a bank (a dike or ridge ) 80 that these worlds are kept asunder and are not confounded, day and night do not pass beyond (over) bank, nor old age, death and misery, neither good deeds nor ovil deeds; all evil deeds turn away from him, for the world of brahma is free from all evil'. Similarly, the Kauṣitaki Up. says &ldquo;being freed from good actions and from evil ones, this knower of brahma moves towards brahma (i. e. becomes one with or is absorbed in brahma).</p>

<p>In this way the Upaniṣads appear to inculcate that the sannyasin should completely give up all actions except living till the body lasts. The Jābalopaniṣad 2470 (4) provides that the very day on which a person becomes disgusted (with worldly life) he should become a wandering ascetio (a sapnyasin). This emphasizes that not mere knowledge but disgust with worldly life is necessary before one becomes a gannyāsin. Vide Katha paniṣad (II. 24) quoted above in note 2467a. The Praśnopaniṣad emphasizes &lsquo;to them alone comes the pure world of brahman, in whom there is no crookedness, no untruth and no duplicity&rsquo; (I 16). The Upaniṣads sometimes do say that one who knows brahma becomes brahma itself'( Mundaka II. 3, 9), but the same Upaniṣads (c. g. Mundaka I. 2. 12.13 quoted in n. 2467a) require great moral and spiritual attainments besides mere knowlegde of brahma.</p>
<p>It is not necessary to set out more Upadiṣad passages to exhibit the proper relation between more knowledge of brahma and Realization of brahma. 2471</p>
<p>In classical Sanskrit several words are employed to describe the state of liberation. The Amarakośa regards mukti, kaivalya, nirvāṇa, śreyas, niṇśreyasa, amsta, mokṣa and apavarga as synonyms. Mukti, mokṣa, and annsta (or amptatva) are frequently employed in the Upaniṣads and the Gitā. They refer to the state of Salvation or Liberation from different points of view. Man is liable to have hankerings and to birth and death; therefore when the soul becomes free from that cycle and realizes brahma it is said that he becomes immortal or secures immor tality. Vide Bs. Up. VI. 4. 7 and 14, V. 15–17 (Vidyayāmstam aśnute), Chān. Up. II. 23. 2 (he who is firmly grounded in brahma attains immortality), Katha Up. VI. 2 and 9, Svet. Up.</p>

Vol. 62 (for 1942) pp. 151-156 appears to suggest that the Upanigads carry forward the idea of the Atharvaveda that knowledge of a matter was supposed to havo magic power. It is oot possible for limitations of space to examine hia arguments at length. With great respect for such a veteran scholar, it bas to be said that, so far as the Upanigads are concerned, mere koowlodge of brahma is only a first step, and that one who desires liberation has to live life on a high moral and spiritual' level.

<p>IV. 17 and 20, III, 1, 10, 13, Gita 13. 12, 14, 20. Mukti and mokṣa are both derived from the root muc' (to be free) and the verbal forms of muc' are frequently used along with * immortality' as in Katha Up. VI. 8 (yam jñātvā mucyate jantur-amrtatvam ca gacohati) and 14, Bś. Up. IV. 4.7, Sv. Up. I. 8 and IV. 16 (jñātvā devam muoyate sarvapāśaih). The word mokṣa oocura in Sv. Up. IV. 16 and Gita 5. 28, 7.29, 18. 30. Niḥśroyaga (moksa, than which there is nothing better) occurs in Kauṣ. Up. III. %, Gitā V.2. Vide p. 1037 671 for niṇśrayasa'. The word &lsquo;śreyas&rsquo; often means &lsquo;botter&rsquo; in the Upaniṣads (Tai. Up. I. 11 and Ohān, Up. IV.6.5) and Gita II. 7, 31, III, 35, XVIII. 47 &amp;o., but in Katha Up. II. 1 and 2 sroyas (as opposed to preyas i. e. pleasure) really means &lsquo;niḥdreyasa&rsquo; (salvation ). 2472 Kaivalya does not occur in the principal Upaniṣads, but kevalah (not affected by guṇas or isolated as pure consciousness ) occurs in śv. Up. IV. 18 and VI. 11 (sākṣi seta kevalo nirgunaśca ) Nirvāṇa ocours in Gita VI. 15 (the yogin, that has subdued his mind and always practises yoga, securOB peace, centred on me that is highest nirvana); in Gitā II. 72 and V. 24-25 we find</p>
<p>• brahmanirvāṇam' which means &lsquo;bliss in brahma. Apavarga occurs only in the Maltri Upaniṣad VI, 30 and was the goal laid down by the very first sūtra of the Nyāyadarsana.</p>
<p>It should be noted that cosmology whether in the Upanigads or later works is based on the geocentric theory and is concerned mostly with the earth, the elements, the Sun, Moon, planets and stars in general (without details ).</p>
<p>The Mapusmrti has several theories on creation. In I 5-19 we have the first theory: this (universe) existed in the form of darkness, was unperceived, destitute of distinctive signa, not subject to reasoning, unknowable, immersed in deep sloop 88 it were. Then the divine Self-existent appeared with irrosistible power, dispelling darkness and making all this including the great elements discernible; he shone forth of his own (will); he, desirous of producing beings of various types from his body, first produced water only after reflecting (over the idea of creating) and planted therein his soed; the seed became a golden egg, equal in brilliance to the sun and in that egg he himself was born as Brahma, the progenitor of the whole</p>

<p>world. He is called Narayana,173 since waters, designated as naras (offspring of Nara), were his firet place of residence. Prom that first cause, not yet unfolded, which can neither be oallod sat nor asat, was produced a purusa (a male) who is called by people Brahmā. In that egg the divine one resided for one year; he divided the egg into two parts after reflecting on that matter; out of those two halves (of the egg ) he created heaven and earth, between these two middle region, the eight directions and the abode of waters (the sea). From himself he drew forth mind which is neither sat nor asat, from mind Ahankara (self-con. sciousness), and the mahat-atman, all products produced by the combinations of three guṇas, the five organs of sonde which perceive the objects of sange; He created all beings by joining the subtle particles of the six (ahankāra and tapmātrās ) with portions of himself, the five great elements enter the framer of all beings. This theory combines the ideas contained in Rg. X.129 (particularly verses 1-3) with those in the Sat. Br.XI. 1.6.1 and Chan. Up. III. 19. 1-2 (about the golden egs) and with the Sāṅkhya theory of tattvas and guṇas, though Manu differs from the standard Sāṅkhya of the Kārikā 88 regards the order in which Mahat, Ahankāra and the five subtle elements arise.

<p>Manusmrti on creation</p>
<p>1517</p>
<p>beginning of creation assigned names, peculiar activities and conditions to all created beings by means of the words of Veda. In this it follows a fruti text (explaining Rg. IX. 62. 1) quoted by Saṅkarācārya (on V. 8. I. 3. 28 ) who quotes &amp; verge in support from the Mahabhārsta and another VOTNO also the source of which is not mentioned but which is found in some purāṇas).</p>
<p>Another theory of creation is stated in Manusmrti I, 32-41. Brahmā divided his own body into two halves, one half a male and the other a female and from that female he created Viraj, who practised tapas and created a male who was no other than Manu (promulgator of Manuamṛti). Manu desirous of produ</p>
<p>oing created beings, first created ten great sages as Prajāpatis, who created seven Manus, Gods, classes of gods, great sages, yaksas rākṣasas, gandharvas, apsarases, snakes, birds classes of pitrs, lightning, clouds, large and small stars, monkeys, fishes, cattle, deor, men, lions, worms, insects, flies, immovable things (trees etc.). This account appears to be inspired by the Puruṣasūkta (Rg. X. 90), particularly verses 5, 8-10.</p>
<p>A third theory of creation by Brahma after he awakes from his sleep is briefly noticed in Manusmrti 1. 74-78, viz, he creates (or appoints ) his mind which impelled by Brahma&rsquo;s desire to create, produces ākāśa (ether), of which sound is the (peculiar) quality; that other modifying itself creates Vayu possessing the quality of touch; from Vāyu arises refulgent light, from which arises water and from water arises the earth of which the special quality is smell. This theory is # modification of the Saṅkhya doctrine, according to which (kārikā 25) all five ela. ments proceed from ahankara and God Brahma is thrown in ( who has no place in standard Saṅkhya). The Manusmrti is in the habit of stating opposing views on the same topic one after another; 0. g. note on the use of flesh in Manu V. 27-46 de compared with V. 48.56, Manu III, 13 as compared with III. 14-19 (on brābmaṇa having a sūdra wife), Manu IX, 59-6% as opposed to IX. 64-68 on the practice of Niyoga.</p>
<p>Accounts of creation occur frequently in the Mahabharata, mostly in the Santiparva. All cannot be set out here, but a few would be described. Chap. 175. 11-21 (=Oh. ed. 18211-21) states that from God known as Avyakta all beings were born, he first oroated mahān also called akāśa, from akasa water was produced, from water were produced fire and yāyu, from the oombination of these two the earth wao produced. Then the</p>
<p>1518</p>
<p>History of Dharmatastra [seo. IX, Oh. XXXIV</p>
<p>self-existent created a lotus, from whioh arose Brahma, known as Ahankara and he produced the whole world. In chap. 176 (183 of Ch. ed.) it is stated that Brahmā first created water, from water arose Vāyu, from the combination of water and Vāyu arose Agni and earth was produced from the combination of Agni, Vāyu and ākāśa. Chap. 177 ( 184, Ch. ed.) explains that the Mahābhūtas (great elements) are five viz. vāyu, ākāśa, agni, water and earth, that all bodies are made of these five, that there are five indriyas, five objects of sense and five qualities, sabda, sparsa ( touch), rūpa (colour), rasa (taste) and gandha (smell); eubdivisions of each of these five are mentioned. Chap. 178 (=189 of Ch. ed.) speaks of the five prāṇas and the spheres of their activities. Chap. 179-180 ( =186-187 of Ch. ed.) deal with jiva (individual self) and states at the end that the body is perishable, that the self passes from one body to another and that by yoga one can see the self in the Highest Self. Chap. 200 ( = 207 Ch. ed.) states that Purusottama created the five elemente, that he reclined on waters, that from his navel sprang a lotus brilliant like the sun, from which arose Brahma, who created from his mind seven sons, Dakṣa, Marici, Atri, Angiras, Pulastya, Pulaha and Kratu. Dakṣa had many daughters (the eldest being Diti), from these daughters Daityaa, Adityas, the other gods, Kāla and its parts, the earth, the four varpas, all kinds of men, Andbras, Pulindas, Sabaras and others in Dakṣiṇāpatha and in the Uttarāpatha, Yauna (Yavanas), Kambojas, Gand hāras, Kirātas, Barbaras and others were produced. Chap. 224 ( =231 Ch. ed.) starts by saying that in the beginning there was brahma, beginningless and endless, unknowable and proceeds to divisions of time from nimeṣa to the yugas and their charac teristics. Herein ocour verses that are the same as in Manusmrti I. 65–67, 69–70,75–77, 81-83, 85-86. It is difficult to say who borrow as even the Manusmrti (in X. 44) mentiong Paundrakas, Odras, Dravidas, Kambojas and Yavanas, Sakas, Pāradas, Pahlavas, Cīnas, Kirātas, Daradas and Khaśas, as having been originally sub-divisions or sub-caster of Ksatriyas (Ksatriya jātayaḥ ) but reduced to the position of sūdras, because of losing all contact with brāhmaṇas (X, 43) and because of the cessation of religious rites (like Upanayana &amp;c.). In śānti 311 (=or. ed. 299) creation is described in Saṅkhya terms with Brahma thrown in. Brahmā (identified with mahān) was born in the golden egg, he remained inside the egg for a year, then be created within the two parts of the egg (heaven and earth), antariksa, from ahankara five elements were produced and theirMahābhārata on Creation</p>
<p>1519</p>
<p>five qualities are mentioned. Lévamedhika (Chap. 40–42 is similar to Santi 311 ) states the order of creation ag ayyakta mahat-abankira-five elements, the only peculiarity being that in Verse 2 mahan is identified with Viṣnu, Sambha, buddhi and several other words are given as synonyms thereof.</p>
<p>The Smrti of Yājñavalkya (III. 67–70) states that from the one Self, many individual selves arise just as from a red-bot iron ball sparks go out, that the unborn and imperishable Atman is said to be born when connected with body, tbat in the beginning of creation, Paramātman creates the five elements, ether, vāyu, tejas, water and earth, each succeeding one posses sing a rising series of qualities and when appearing as indivi dual self, it receives (for body) the same elements. Then after pointing out how a human being is conceived, how the foetus grows in the womb and describing the anatomy (with number of bones, veins, arteries, muscles &amp;c.) of the human body, the Smrti avers that the whole world proceeds from the Paramātman and the individual self appears from the elements ( which form the body). The individual self is beginningless 2475 and is not born, but it comes in intimate contact with a body that is due to acts influenced by false ideas, hankerings and aversions (III. 125). From the several parts (mouth, arms, thighs, feet &amp;c ) of the First Prinoiple that assumes numerous forms arise the four varnas in order, the earth, heaven, prānas, directions, Vāyu, Agni, Moon (from mind), the Sun (from His eye), sky and the whole movable and immovable world (III, 126-128). Hare the Purugagūkta (Re X. 90.1 and 12-14) is closely followed.</p>
<p>The Purāṇas devote thousands of verses to the theories of cosmology and cosmography. Only a very brief summary is all that can be attempted from the contents of a few among the extant Purānag that have been shown above to be the earliest, viz, Matsya, Vayu, Brahmānda, Viśṇu and Mārkandeya. It has been stated above (pp. 838-840) that the topics with which Furāṇas were deemed to be concerned were according to the Amarkośa five and that some of the Puraṇas themselves set out the five topics as creation ( sarga), resreation after dissolution (pratisarga), dynasties (vamsa), the vast periods of time (called Manvantaras), and history and deeds of the descendants of the</p>

<p>History of Dhurmatāstra (sec. IX, Ch. XXXIV</p>
<p>solar, lunar and other dynastiea ( Varsanuoarita). Thus, many of the Purāpas deal with creation at some length. A few striking theories and passages alone can be set out or cited.</p>
<p>The Matsyapurāpa begins the topic of creation in the same way as the Manusmrti does and some of the verses of the former are identical (or alınost identical) with the yorges of the Manusmṛti, 7476 The Matsya (2. 27) states; Nārāyapa alone appeared first and being desirous of creating the manifold world, produced from his body waters, cast the seed therein and a golden egg emerged; inside that egg the Sun appeared, he is called Aditya as well as Brahmā, he made the two halves of the egg into heaven and earth and produced all directions and the aky between the two ( beaven and earth). Then the Meru and other mountains and the seven seas (of salt, sugarcane juice &amp;c.) were produced. Nārāyaṇa became Prajāpati who created all this world including gods and asuras. The 3rd chap. of the Matsya speaks of the Vedas, Purāṇas and Vidyās as proceeding from his lips and states that he created from his mind ten sages, Marici, Atri and others (3.5-8). Then the Matsya launches on the Sāṅkhya scheme of creation (in 3. 14-29), stating that the three gunas are sattva, rajas, tamas, and the state of their equili brium is called Praksti, that some call it Pradhāna, otiliers call it Avyakta, that this Pradhāna produces creation, that from the three guṇas rose Brahmā, Viṣpu and Maheśyara; that from Pradhana arose Mahān, from the latter ahankara, then five Jñanendriyas and five Karmendriyas and the mind as the 11th songe and the five tanmātrās (subtle elements); that ākāśa was produced from the sabda-tanmātrā, vāyu from akasa, tejas from Vayu and water from tejas, that the Purusa is the 25th tattva. Then the Matsya (3. 30–44) tells a fantastic story that Brahma produced a woman (called Satarūpā, Savitri, Sarasvati, Gayatri or Brabmāpi) from himself, felt passion for her and had after a long time a son named Manu (called Syāyambhuva) and also Virāj from her; then Brahmā called upon his sons to create people. The Mataya in chapter four states that Brahmi had from Satarūpā seven song, Marici and others (verses 25-26, contradicting chap. 3. 5–8), mentions two sons of Syāyambhuva Manu and also the descendants of those two sons.

<p>chapters from five onwards describe the descendants of Daksa, of Kabyapa, of Diti, the coronation of Pythu, the solar and lunar dynastie and various classes of pitys.</p>
<p>The Vayapurāna devotes five chapters (4-9) to creations of differents kinda (in over 600 verges). In Chap. 4 verges 22-61 the Saṅkhya sobema of Pradhina, Mahat, Abankāra, Tapmatras in set out and is combined with the egg theory (verses 66ff). Chap, 6 appears to refer (vorses 2-3) to the Purugasūkta (Rg. X. 90. 1-2), explains that Nārāyaṇa is so called because he reclines on waters, refers to the Boar incarnation, to nine kinds of crea tion, states a ( different theory) that Brahmā Created in the beginning the mind-born sons and Sanandana and Sabaka (6.65). Chapter 7 refers to re-oreation, Chap. 8 ( containing 198 Verses) refers to the Yugas, their durations, the creation of eight Deva yonis, of animala, metres &amp;c., and different sons of Brahmā.</p>
<p>The Brahmāṇdapurāṇa I (chapters 3-5) deal with the appearance of Hiraṇyagarbha and various kinds of creations and chapter 4 refers to Pradhāna, the gunas and states that creation is due to the uneven mixture of guṇas that constitute Pradhana but these work under Viṣnu. Chap. 5 speaks of various kinds of creations, and tho mānasa sons of Brahmi. Chapters 8, 11 of the Anuṣangapada (2nd section of the Purana ) deal with the creation of gods, pitrs, men and of the great sagos, Bhrgu &amp;o.</p>
<p>The first three chapters ( containing about 240 verses) of the Brahmapurāpa deal with creation. Chap. 1 (vergos 34 f) puts forward Brahmā as the creator of all bhutas (beings) and 88 devotee of Nārāyana and then states that ahankāra arose from mahat and from ahankāra the elements were produced. The Brahma like the Matsya closely follows (in I. 37-41) Manu I. 5-13. It refers to the creation of the soven sages Marloi, Atzi and others who were seven Brahmānah, the creation of Sadhyas, gods, the Rgveda and other Vedas, birds and all sorts of beings; it also states (I 53) that Viṣnu created Virāj, who created Puruga (this is based on the Puruṣasūkta (Rg. X. 90. 5) and that Puruṣa created people.

<p>married to king some Chapter 3 deals with the creation of gods and asuras. 2477 &amp; The Vigpupurāng in Chapters 2, 4, 5,7 of the first añīa deals with several kinds of creation Chapter 2 starts with Viṣnu and asserts that Pradhāna and Puruṣa are his forms and in verses 34-50 proclaims the details of the Saṅkhya system and verse 54 refers to the production of the egg by Mabat and other tattvas. Chap. 3 deals with the question how brahman, which is free from guṇas, inconceivable, pure and untainted, is the author of creation, the reply being that there are natural powers (Saktis ) in all things that are inconceivable and so brahman has the power of creating the universe. Chap. 5 deals with nino kinds of creations viz. of Mabat, Tanmātrās, bhūtas, (elements), Vaikārika (i.6. Aindriyaka), Mukhya (i.e, of immovable objects), of lower animals, of urdhvarstas (i. e, divine beings), of human beings, of Kumāras ( i. e. Sanatkumāra and others).</p>
<p>The Mārkandeya-purāna in Chap. 42 speaks of the creation of Pradhāna, Mahat, Abankāra, Tanmātrās under the aegis of Brahmā. Chap. 44 speaks of the nine kinds of creation as in Viṣṇu. Chapters 45, 46, 47 deal with the creations of Gods, pitss, human beings, the four varpas, beasts, birds, trees and plants &amp;c. Passages from other Purāṇas need not and cannot be quoted as they are in the same strain as above and as limita tions of space preclude further elaboration</p>

<p>The Purāṇas devote thousands of verses to cosmography 2478 i. e, desoription of the divisions of the earth called dvipas, Varṣas, the mountains, the oceans, the rivers and the countries therein and their extent, the motions of the sun, moon, planets, the yugas, manyantaras, and kalpas 2419 and Dharmaśāstra works frequently rely on them. Jambudvipa was known at least before 300 B. O. 88 Asoka mentions it in his Rūpanātha Rook Inscription, quoted above on p. 1016 n 1649. The word &lsquo;dvipa&rsquo; occurs in the Rgveda I. 169. 3 and VII. 20. 4 (vi dvipāni pāpatan). Pāṇini derives the word from dvi and āpah. (VI. 3.97). A bare out line of these from some Purāṇas may be indicated here. The Mat ayapurāṇa starts by saying (in chap. 113. 4-5) that there are thou sanda of dvipas, but as it is not possible to describe the whole of the world in order it would expound only the seven 2400 dvipas.</p>

<p>History of Dharmafāstra (Soc. IX, Oh. XXXIV</p>
<p>Chapters 121-123 of the same Purana mention by name seven dvipas viz. Jambudvipa, Sakadvipa, Kuśa, Krauñoa, Salmala, Gomedaka and Puskara, each succeeding one being double of each preceding one and each surrounded by a sea and each having doved var sas, seven principal mountains, seven main rivers. The seven oceans surrounding the seven dvipas are stated to be respectively of salt 3181 water, milk, liquid ghee, curds, liquor, sugar-cane juice, fresh water. The names and order of the dvipas differ to some extent in different Purānas e. g. the Viṣnu II. 1.12-14, II, 2.5, the Brahmapurāṇa (18.11) mention them 29. Plakṣa, Sālmala, Kuśa, Kraunca, Saka and Puṣkara. The Vayu (33. 11-14), Kūrma I. 45. 3, Mārk, 50, 18-20 mention the game soven in the same order.</p>
<p>The descriptions of Kalpa, Manvantara, Yug&amp; in the Purāṇas have already been dealt with in H. of Dh. Vol. III. p. 890–91 and above pp. 686-693 and pralaya has been treated of in Vol. II pp. 893-895 and pp. 693-695 above. The Purāṇas contain thousands of verses on these topios.</p>
<p>The Viṣṇu (II. 2. 13-24) mentions the var ṣas as Bharata (the first among them ), Kimpuruṣa, Hari, Ramyaka, Hirapmaya, Uttara-Kuru, Ilāvṛta, Bhadrāśva and Ketumala. The Vamana (13. 2-5) mentions the same except that it substitutes Campaka for Ramyaka. Viṣnu IL (1. 16-17) states, however, that Nabhi, Kimpurasa, Hariyarsa, Ilavṣta, Ramya, Hiranvat, Kurt, Bhadrasva, Ketumāla were the names of pine kings, sons of Agnidhra, son of Priyavrata, a son of Svayambhuva Manu and that the varṣas given to the nine sons of Agnidhra were rospeotively Himāhya (i. e. Bhārata), Hemakūta, Naiṣadha, Ilavsta, Nllkoala, Sveta, Sppgavat, a varsa to east of Mera, Gan. dhamadana. Thus there is a confusion of names of kings and names of var ṣas. Vāyu (30. 38-40) states the same names of</p>
<p>(Continued from last page ) pipah). It is possible to take the word dvipa in the sense of Islands and not in the senge of continents in these cases. From Pag. IV.3. 10 (dvipade anusamudram yan) it appears that the word &lsquo;dvipa&rsquo; was also used abont Islands near the sea coast. Vide Nino dvipas of Bharatavarra&rsquo; by Sashi bhushad Chandari la I.

The Brahmanda (II. 16.7, says the same thing.

<p>principal mountains of Bhāratvarṣa are Mahendra, Malaya, Sahya, Suktimat, Rkṣaparvata, Vindhya and Pariyatra. The Purāṇas affirm that Bhārata is the best in the varsas of Jambu dvipa (Brahma 19, 23-24, Viṣnu III. 3. 22, Brahmanda II. 16. 17 ). Some of them contain fine eulogies of Bhārata (e. g. Brahma 87. 2.9 and 69-79, Viṣnu II. 3. 23-26.).</p>
<p>In several Purāpa, nine divisong of Bhāratavarṣa are named viz. Indradvipa, Kaseru, Tamraparna, Gabhastimat, Nāgadvipa, Sahya, Gandharva, Vāruṇa and a ninth which is 1000 yojanas long from north to south, on the east of which are Kirātas and on the west Yavanas and the four varnas in the middle of it.2484. It may be noted that though Bharatavarṣa is only one the divisions of Jambudvipa, some of the nine divisions are themselves called Indradvipa and Nāgadvipa. Another impor tant matter is that Matsya 114. 10, Vayu 45. 81, Vāmana 13. 11, and Brahmānda appear to call the 9th dvipa Kumāra or as extending from Kumāriki to the sources of the Gangā, Thero</p>

<p>fore, it appear that the 9th division of Bharatvarṣa was held to be a country like modern India and the other eight divisions seem to be countries and Islands lying to the south-east of prosent India. It is probable that early works identified Bharatvaras with what is now modern India, but when Indian culture spread to South-East Asia, Bhāratavarṣa was used to denote India as well as Greater India.</p>
<p>Sabara (bhāsya on Jai, X. 1, 35) shows that the language of cultured people from the Himayat to cape Comorin was the same (prasiddhasca sthalyām caruśabdaḥ &amp; Himayataḥ ā oa Ku maribhayaḥ prajujyamāno drstah). Vide also his bhāsya on</p>
<p>Jai. X. 1. 42 for the same words. The snow-capped mountains were known to the sages of the Rgveda (vide X. 121, 4 &lsquo;yag. yeme Himayanto mahitvā yasya samudram Tagayā sahāhuḥ). *Yasya&rsquo; in the yerse quoted refers to Hiranyagarbha. The Atharyayeda (V, 4, 2 and 8) mentions Himavat in the singular. Parvatas (plural) occur several times in Rg. III. 33. 1, IV.54.5 and also parvata in the singular (Rg. I. 37.7, V, 56. 4). The Mahabharata, Sabara, Puranas and the Bphat-samhita show that anoient Indian people identified their culture with Bhāratan Varga i, o, they identified country and culture, not race with culture.</p>
<p>The Brahmapurāṇa and the Mārkandeya appear to confine Bharatvarsa substantially to what has been known for centuries as India when they describe it as &lsquo;to its south, west and east there is the great ocean, to its north is Himavat resembling the string of a bow.&lsquo;2485 Vide H, of Dh. Vol. II, pp. 11-16 for discussion as to the limits of Āryāyarta and pp. 17-18 for Bbārata-varga.</p>

This is a vast subject and bas during the last few decades attracted the minds of numerours writers in the West. There is now a voluminous literature in the West on reincarnation, 2487a Several countries in historical times believed in transmigration. Herodotus 34876 states that some of the Greeks (whose names he know but did not disclose ) had used that doctrine as their own, but that the Egyptians were the first to teach that the human soul was immortal and that at the time of the death of the body it entered into some other living thing then coming to birth. Pythagoras appears to have believed in it and there are controversies whether he derived it from India. Prof. A. B. Keith (in J. R. A. S. for 1909 pp. 569 606) after a lengthy discussion holds that Pythagoras did not borrow it from India. The present writer does not express any opinion on that subject as it is irrelevant for the purpose of this volume. Hopkins and Macdonnell accept the theory of Indian Influence on Pythagoras, but Oldenberg and Keith do not.</p>
<p>Not only Pythagoras, but Empedocles (who is reported to have said that he was a boy, a girl, a bush, a bird and a fish) and Plato believed in the pre-existence and post-existence of the soul, in the idea that the bodies which will accompany the soul in several births would bear similitude to the lives that</p>

<p>they had led, that the happiest would be those who had practised the social and civil virtues called temperance and justice and that supersensible thinking would be the only means of dis engaging the soul from successive lives of sense. Vide Kenneth Walker&rsquo;s &ldquo;The circle of Life&rsquo; p. 93 (where he says that the do ctrine of metempsychosis was probably well-known in India at the time of Christ) and Gough&rsquo;s &lsquo;Philosophy of the Upaniṣads&rsquo; (London 1882), pp. 25-28, where he cites a long passage from Plato&rsquo;s Phaedon on this subject and pp. 29-31 for a long quotation from Humo&rsquo;s Dialogues concernig Natural Religion on the miseries and migration of the soul from body to body. Gough on p. 25 of the above work opines that since in the Vedic literature prior to the Upanisads there is no reference to the belief in the passage of the soul into plants and human bodies, it is reasonable to suppose that the Hindus borrowed this doctrine from the indigenes in the course of their absorption of indigenous blood. Vide also &lsquo;Studies in honour of Bloom field&rsquo; pp. 76-88 for G. W. Brown&rsquo;s views to the same effeot. This is a most gratuitous assumption, it is a pure con jecture and without any evidence whatever. If belief in trans migration could exist among Egyptians and many primitive tribes, there is no reason to assume that Indians did not them selves arrive at the doctrine, particularly when there exists Dowhere else in the whole world any theory of Karma and transmigration 80 detailed, so influential and so thorough as in Sanskrit Literature. One may dismiss the conjectures of Gough and G. W. Brown as verbiage (the latter conjectures on pp. 87-88 that even the words Yoga, Sāṅkhya and Upanisad are coined from similar words in some Dravidian tongue now lost). All Scholars ( particularly Western ones when writing about the East) should lay to heart the words of Mallinātha &lsquo;nāmālam likhyate kingit&rsquo;. The present writer is not against conjectures at all but they must not be bold and must always be treated as such. But the danger is that the conjecturos of former scholars or men are often treated as valid conclusions by later writers, All scholars must bear in mind Acton&rsquo;s warning &lsquo;Guard against the prestige of great names; no trusting without testing&rsquo;. In the H. of Dh. Vol. IV. pp. 38-40 the doctrine of Karma and Punarjanma was briefly discussed in relation to the con sequence of sins and their removal and details were reserved for treatment later.</p>

<p>this doctrine and the vicissitudes and modifications of it and the objections raised against it in modern times. It is a remarkable circumstance that, though the several darśanas (such as Sāṅkhya, Yoga, Nyāya, Vaiśesika, Pūrvamlmāmgā and Vedānta ) severely criticize some doctrines of each other, the doctrine of Karma and transmigration received alınost un animous support except among materialists (like Cārvāka), Prof. Wilson in &lsquo;Religion of the Hindus&rsquo; (London, ed. of 1862) vol. II, p. 112 remarks &lsquo;metem psychosis is not only the one point on which all are agreed, it is the one point which none have over disputed&rsquo;. The Buddhista and Jains, though they differed on many matters from Vedic and Smrti literature, adopted this doctrine in their own way. There are some suppositions antecedent to all beliefs in Karma and trans migration viz. (1) man has a soul, eternal and separate from the physical body, (2) that other organisms, animals, plants and probably inanimate objects possess souls, (3) that the souls of men and lower animals can pass from one kind of physical organism to another, (4) that the soul is both doer and sufferer,</p>
<p>It has already been shown at some length (in Vol. IV. pp. 154-171) how ideas of Heaven and Hell were developed from ancient Vedic times and it has been stated (on y. 158 of that volume) that the doctrine of Karma and transmigration modified the doctrine of Heaven and Hell,</p>
<p>The word karma occurs in the Rgveda over forty times, In some passages it appears to mean exploits' or &lsquo;valiant deeds&rsquo; as in the following: &lsquo;Observe the exploits of Visnu&rsquo; (Rg. 1. 22. 19), proclain by your word (or Verses) the 2483 ancient deeds of Him (Indra) who is worthy of praise' (Rg. I. 61. 13); &ldquo;that deed of his (of Indra), who is wonderful, is most worthy of worship, that deed is most beautiful, that he filled with sweet waters of four rivers' (Rg. I. 62. 6); &lsquo;who is firm in each exploit&rsquo; (Rg. I. 101, 4); &lsquo;O Indral four are your divine and unconquer able names,&hellip; under which you performed exploita&rsquo;(Rg. X. 54. 4);&lsquo;O Aspins! frequent drinkers of delicious Soma and Lords of splendour, you helped (or protected) Indra in his exploits</p>

<p>against Namuoi, son of Asura (or of the Asura breed)&rsquo; in Rg, X. 131. 4. In several other passages of the Rgveda &ldquo;karma means &lsquo;religious works&rsquo; (such as sacrifices or gifts); (the gods ) accept (or like ) all works of this poet who brings to you a hymn of praise &lsquo;2489 (Rg. I 148. 2); (O Indra), give your ear to (the prayer) of Syāvāśva who offers Soma to you, as you listened to (the prayers of) Atri who performed religious works&rsquo; (Rg. VIII. 36. 7); O pure Soma! with thy help our ancient and wise forefathers performed works' (Rg. IX. 96. 11). In very ancient times Heaven was believed to be the place for enjoying the rewards of most works. Rewards of this world such as wealth, heroic sons were no doubt prayed for, but it was immortality (amptatva) and the joys of heaven, that were highly valued. In Rg. X. 16. 4 Agni is prayed to take the deceased to the world of those who performed good works (tābhir-vahainam sukstām u lokam). The words sukstām lokam' occur in the Atharva veda 2990 (III, 28. 6, XVIII. 3.71) and in the Vāj. S. 18. 52. In Rg. IX, 113. 7–10 the sacrificer who offers Soma to Indra prays that he may be placed in that world (heaven) as an immortal, where there is never-ending light, where Yama, the son of Vivasvat, is the King, where there are joys and delights and where there are desires and their fulfilment. The prayers for immortality are made in the Rgveda to all gods, e. g. to Agni in I 31.7, IV 58. 1, V. 4. 10., Vi. 7. 4, to the Maruts in V. 55. 4, to Mitra and Varuṇa in V, 63. 2, to Visve-Devas in X 52.5 and X. 62.1, to Soma in I. 91.1, IX. 94. 4, IX. 108, 3. But about the fate of evil-doers not much is said in the Rgveda. In the Brāhmana works greater details are offered as to rewards of good works and the retribution for evil deeds. Śat. Br. (XII. 9. 1. 1) puts forth the idea of retribution (oited above).2491 The same idea is set forth as to flesh-eating in Manu and Viṣnu-dharmasūtra, which state</p>

<p>Mthat being wilde flere I eat here would eat me in the next world, tbe wise declare tils to be the origin of the word &lsquo;nāṁra&rsquo;.* The Smt. Br. in another pandaye refers to a strange legend 219: Burgu, who had boorne vain on account of his learning and thought hitarelf sagre learned than big father Varuna, was asked by his father to go to the four quarters from east to north and report what he would see there. Horrible sights met him in all directions e. g. in the east he say non dismembering men, huwing off their limbs one by one and saying &lsquo;this to you, this to mo&rsquo;. 11s said this is horrible'. They replied &lsquo;these indeed dealt with us in yonder world and so we now deal with them in return. Then in the north be saw that men crying aloud were hoing outon lig men crying aloud. When he said &lsquo;horrible &amp;c&rsquo;; they replied those indeed dealt with us&hellip; in return&rsquo;. This is a long story and it is not necessary to set out the whole. This story probably gives expression to the popular notion of &lsquo;tit for tat&rsquo;. But one thing is clear that the sat. Br. indicates by this story that a belief had then arisen that one who does evil in ono life has to suffer for it in a later life from that being whom he treated badly. The Śat. Br and the Tai. Br. both several times speak of conquering or casting off' punarmītyu' (ronowed death, liability to be born and die again and again). Two passages from the Sat, Bṭ. and Tai. Br. may be quoted. In X. 4, 4 the Sat. Br. tells the story that gods became immortal by means of the proper performance of Agnicayana as Prajapati advised them viz. hy laying down 360 enclosing stones, 360 Yajusmati bricks and 36 more thoroon, 10800 Lokam prpā brioke. In X. 4. 4. 9 it is said &lsquo;he who is to become immortal through knowledge (vidyā)31% and through sacred works (karman) mball become immortal after separating from the body, and then X. 4. 4. 10 assorts that those who know this or those who do this holy work come to life again after dying and coming to life thoy secure immortal life; but those who do not know</p>

<p>Story of Naciketas in Tai. Br.</p>
<p>1535</p>
<p>this or do not perform this sacred work oome to life again when they die and they become the food of him (Death) time after time.&rsquo; In the Tai. Br. III, 11, 8 the story of Naciketas is narrated just as in the Kathopaniṣad (some of the verses are the same in both). Death grants Naoiketas three boons in the Tai. Bṛ., the third being different in the Kathopan iṣad. The third boon asked by Naoiketas in Tai. Br. is &lsquo;Declare to me how to cast off punarmstyu.&rsquo; Death declared to him the Nāoiketa fire, thereby he (Nacikotas) cast off or kept off punarmṛtyu,2494 The words &lsquo;apa punasmṛtyum jayati&rsquo; occur in Kauṣitaki Br. 25. 1 and several times in the Bṛ. Up. I. 2. 7., I. 5. 2, III. 2., 10, III. 3.2.</p>
<p>From the ancient popular idea of retribution for evil deeds probably arose the idea of the setting of good deeds against the evil deads of a person and weighing them as if in a balance. The Sat. Br. states 2495 &ldquo;Now this one is the balance, viz. the right side of the vedi. 24% Let him sit down touching the right edge of the vedi, for indeed they place him on the balance in yonder world and whichever of two will rise he will follow, whether it be good or evil. And whosoever knows this mounts the balance even in this world and escapes being placed on the balance in yonder world, for it is good deed that rises and not his evil deod',</p>
<p>The Satapatba had arrived at the idea that man&rsquo;s will (and corresponding deed) governs what world he will reach after death. It says &lsquo;Let him meditate on truth as brahma. Now man here is mostly will and, according 8.8 his will is when he departs from this world, does he on departing become of similar will in the yonder world&rsquo;. 24%</p>
<p>There is a curious passage in the Satapaths (X. 1.5. 4) about the powers conferred by sacrifices in the yonder world. It states that he who had regularly performed Agnihotra eats food</p>

<p>in the eveniog and morning in the yondar world, the performer of Darsa and Purnamāsa sacrifica eats food every balf month; the performer of Caturmabyas (Abasobal sacrificos) eate food in the yonder worlds every four months. the performer of animal sacrifice every six months; the Soma sacrificer once a year; the builder of tbe fire after (agoicit) eats food every hundred years at his will or may not require it at all after once taking it, for a hundred years are as much as immortality, unending and everlasting.</p>
<p>The Sat. Br. bad arrived at the conclusion that every man is born in a world fashioned by himself. It also asserted that he who sacrifices to the gods does not win such a place as the one who sacrifices to the Atman and the latter froeg himself from the mortal body, from sin, as a anako frees itself from its slough 219.</p>
<p>It must be conceded that a clear statement about the doctrine of karma and punarjanma is absent from the whole of the Rgveda. Rg. VII. 33 is an important hymn. The first nine verses are spoken by Vasiṣtha about his song. Verses 10-14 refer to Vasiṣtha2498 himself and are either attributed to his sons or according to another view are part of a dialogue with Indra. The verses are inythological, mystical and rather difficult to explain. Verse 10 refers to one birth of Vasiṣtha when the gods Mitra and Varuna saw him reaching the refulgence of lightning and it is said that Agastya brought him (Vasiṣtha) to the people. Here the words skam janma' indicate that another janma of Vasistha is intended in this hymn. Verge 11 refers to Vasiṣtha as born of Mitra and Varupa from Urvasi and states that all the gods placed him in puskara (either antarikṣa or lotus); verse 12 is iraportant for the metaphorical and mystical statement that</p>

<p>Prof. R. D. Ranade2499 in his &lsquo;Constructive survey of the Upanishadic philosophy&rsquo; (pp. 145-166) relies upon oertain mantras of the Rgveda for stating that there is evidence for holding that an approach to the idea of Transmigration was being made by the vedio sages (p. 147), though he concedes (on the same page ) that in the major part of the Rgveda the idea of transmigration is conspicuous by its absence.</p>
<p>Among the texts on which he relies are Rs. I. 164.3,4,16, 17,20,30,31,38. The whole hymn has several riddles, has highly imaginative descriptions of the year, the path of the Sun, questions and answers and is a late hymn, as he him self admits (p. 150).

In I. 164. 38 the word जीब does not occur. At the most there is a contrast between the immortal part i.e. soul) and the mortal part (the body) in the verses 30 and 38. These two ( soul and body) are always bound together; one of them (the body) is well known to peopte, the other (the soul) is not so known. The verse अपश्यं गोपा (क.

Sāyaṇa gives goveral mea. nings of this verse. The present author fails to understand how the words &lsquo;father&rsquo;s father&rsquo; indicate any reference to transmig. ration in this verse, as Prof. Ranade asserts. Why he presses this verse of I. 164 into service the present author cannot understand. After referring to I. 164. 32 ( which doubts whether be who created all this knows its real nature ) he states it gets such a high price on the mystical knowledge which it glori. fies that any one who comes in possession of this knowledge may be said to be his father&rsquo;s father.'

<p>The verse 20&rsquo;dvā suparnā&rsquo; also occurs in the Mundako paniṣad III. 1. and SV. Up. IV, 6 and refers to the individual soul and the Supreme Self and tells us that the former is bhoktr (taster of worldly pleasures), while the latter simply looks on. But so far as the present writer can see there is absolutely nothing about a former or future life in the verse. Verse 30 draws &amp; sharp distinction between the self which is immortal and the body which is mortal and states that the two are bound together to the same place. Verse 31 is a description of the movements of the Sun who is called &lsquo;gopā&rsquo; (protector, guardian) and speaks of his coming to the worlds again and again. Prof. Ranade sees too much in the words &lsquo;gopām&rsquo;, which is applied to Agni (Rg. I. 1. 8, 1. 96. 7), to Soma (in Rg. VI. 52.3), to Varuna (in Rg. VIII, 42.2), to Visnu in Rg. I. 22. 18. In Rg. III. 43.5 the words &lsquo;gopām janasya&rsquo; (protector of the people ) ocour, Prof. Ranade translates (p. 151 ) he saw the guardian returning frequently to mundane regions'. Why should we not translate (particularly when we have the words &lsquo;bhuvanesvantaḥ &lsquo;) &lsquo;I saw the guardian Sun again and again returning to the worlds and moving towards me and away from me by different paths&rsquo;&rsquo;.

<p>X, 16 has 14 verses, is one of the funeral hymns and the Gre mation fire ( as Agni or Jātavedas) is expressly mentioned in eleven verses. Verse 3(addressed to the deceased) may literally be translated as &lsquo;may thy eye go to the Sun, ātman (prāṇa) to wind, go to heaven or the earth by dharman or go to the waters if you find your benefit in them; be firmly established in the plants with the limbs of the body.&rsquo; The express mention of &lsquo;heaven&rsquo; shows that this is only one of the numerous verses of the Rgveda in which heaven is referred to as the abode of those who perform good works and that there is nothing more in it than that. Vide above pp. 20–21 for the meaning of dharman (which is the only form of the word employed in the Rgveda) viz. &lsquo;religious rites or sacrifices&rsquo; (in most Rgveda passages) or rarely &lsquo;fixed principles of conduct&rsquo;. The very next yerse (X16. 4) contains a prayer to Agni to carry the deceased to the world of people of good deeds (tabhirvahainam sukṛtām-u lokam). There is no reason to suppose that in Rg. X. 16. 3 anything more is meant than what is prayed for in verge 4. Besides, the basic idea of punarjanma is that future existence is regulated by the good or evil deeds of a person and he has no option whatever. In Rg. X. 16. 3 the departed spirit is told that he may go to heaven or earthi or waters or plants. This is not the doct rine of punarjanma at all. In X. 16. 5 the cremation fire is addressed &lsquo;O Agnil send forth the departing man who is offered 88 an oblation into thee and who will move on with the food offered, again to (the world of) pitrs; the remainder (left after the body is burnt) putting on a new life may go near (pit?s) and be connected with (a now) body in that world. This verse con tains the same idea as in X 16. 4 in different words and refers</p>

<p>only to the other world (pitȚs) and not to transmigration, Prof. Ranade refers (p. 148) to Rg. X. 58 and translates one of the perses as meaning that the sage will recall the soul and make it live again by his song. It is not clear what verse or Verses he has in view. He has probably only the first verse in view. That hymn has twelve yerses in each of which a quarter is different but three quarters are the same. None of the verses contains any express word for song. Besides, mind is different from the soul even in the Rgveda (vide Rg. X. 57. 5 where both words &lsquo;manaḥ&rsquo; and &lsquo;jivam&rsquo; occur). Moreover, the man is not yet dead. The composer uses the present tense (ā vartayāmasi) and means to say that he will try to prevent his dying. In the present author&rsquo;s opinion there is not even a distant reference to trans migration in this hynn or in any of the four hymns (Rg. X. 57-60) which are assigned to brothers Bandhu, Srutabandhu and Vipra-bandhu, who are called Gaupāyanas in the Anukra mani. In Rg. X. 60. 7 Subandhu who appears to have been &amp; brother of the three is addressed &lsquo;O Subandhu ! here comes your mother, your father, your very life&rsquo; etc., and in X.60.10 it is said * I have brought the mind of Subandhu from Yama Vaivasvata in order that he may live and not die.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In Rg. X. 14. 8 there is no reference (as some suppose) to return to this world after enjoying the fruits of good deeds in the company of pitȚg. The first half of the verge expresses that the newly departed spirit will be united with pitrs, with Yama and with his good deeds. The 2nd half asks the departed to leave behind his sons and be united in heaven with a new and brilliant body.</p>
<p>Rg. IV. 42 (in ten verses) is a hymn of a sage-like king Trasadaggu, son of Purukutsa, who identifies himself with Indra and Varuṇa in verse 3 2501 &lsquo;I who bave become enlightened about the worlds am Indra and Varupa and by my greatness am the two worlds (heaven and earth) that are wide, deep (spacious) and well-fixed. I sent forth heaven and earth like Tvaṣt? (Prajāpati) and support them.&rsquo; Here by virtue of true knowledge he identifies himself with Indra and Varuna but there is no conception of transmigration. Similarly, Vāmadova</p>

<p>1541</p>
<p>having attained knowledge of Reality asserts 2502 &lsquo;I have become Manu and the Sun, I. am the wise sage Kaksivat; I reached Kutsa, the son of Arjuni, I am the seer Uśanas; look upon me (as identifiable with all)&rsquo;. This verse is quoted in Bṛ. Up. I. 4. 10 (which would be set out later on and explai ned). In this also there is no expregs reference to a past birth as Manu or as the Sun. In Rg. IV. 27. 1 Vāmadeva declares</p>
<p>while still staying in the womb (of my mother) I learnt all the births of these gode; if a hundred fortresses of ayas (copper or iron) had guarded me, I would have still escaped like a hawk with swiftness' (another meaning is also possible which may be set out later). This is quoted in the Ait. Up. II. 5 (to be quoted and explained later). Prof. R. D. Ranade understands (pp. 49, 153) Rg. IV. 26. 1 as saying that Vāmadeva makes an uncon scious utterance that he was in a former life Manu or the Sun. In that verse Vāmadeva indentifies himself with five persons, Manu, Sūrya, sage Kaksivat, Kutsa and Uśanas. There is no word like &lsquo;janma&rsquo; On Prof. Ranade&rsquo;s view Vāmadeva would have to be beld to state five previous births at least (and if so in a confused order). Besides, the following verses clearly show that Vāmadeva makes a claim to be identical with the Supreme Principle by giving the earth to the Āryas, sending rain to those who give offerings, making the gods follow his desire or will. The utmost that can be said is that he claims identity with the Godhead. Deussen in &lsquo;Philosophy of the Upanishads&rsquo; (p. 318) holds that both the verses (Rg. IV. 26. 1 and IV. 27. 1.) have nothing to do with the doctrine of the soul&rsquo;s transmigration, The present author respectfully agrees with Deussen and thinks that Prof, Ranade is wrong. Saṅkarācārya 1503 on V.S. I. 1.30 explains that Indra looking upon himself as brahma according to the Vedāntaśāstra gives the instruction &lsquo;know me alone&rsquo;, quotes' Br. Up. I. 4. 10, and on V. S. III. 4. 51 reiterates that in Rg. IV. 27. 1 the Veda expressly asserts that Vamadova, while still in the mother&rsquo;s womb, realized his identity with brahma and then remarks that this vedio</p>

<p>Mr. J. S. Karandikar of Poona (&amp; staunch disciple and follower of Lokamānya Tilak) in his learned work &lsquo;Gitatattva māñjarl&rsquo; (in Marathi, Poona 1947) asserts (on pp. 775-776 ) that the doctrine of transmigration is as old as the Vedic age (i.e. the Samhitās) and relies for this proposition on only four verses of the Rgveda viz. X. 14. 8, X. 16. 3 and 5 and X. 135. 6. The first three of these four hare been explained above in dealing with Prof. R. D. Ranade&rsquo;s views. Mr. Karandikar summarises Rg. X. 16.5 as a prayer to Agni that the latter should take the departed to the world of pitss and should send him baok to his relatives after endowing him with a new brilliant body. There are no words for &lsquo;back to his relatives ' nor for &lsquo;brilliant in the verse at all. The word &lsquo;punaḥ&rsquo; occurs in the first half and refers to the deceased&rsquo;s coming to pitflola after the body is burnt on the earth and the second half refers to the new body to be had in the world of pitra (and not to relatives Rg. X. 14. 8. on which Mr. Karandikar relies has nothing to do with returning to the earth. After leaving his bad deeds (avadya) behind the deceased is asked to go to the home of the pitra with a brilliant body. The brilliant body is not earthly but of the pitr world. Rg. X. 135. 6. is quoted in the note below.2505 That verse is an extremely vague one and is a riddle or is metapho rical. That hymn of seven verses is addressed to Yama and the Anukramaṇi says that the rși of it is Kumāra of Yama&rsquo;s family,</p>

<p>Rg. X. 186 explained</p>
<p>1543</p>
<p>The first verse of Rg. X. 135 refers to Yama who is said to drink (Soma) along with the gods under a tree (i. e. in a garden) with fine foliage, where our (my) father, lord of people, desires to send (me) to the ancient fathers. It is possible that this refers to Naciketas as Sāyaṇa, following the story of Naoiketas in the Tai. Br. IIL 11. 8 and in the Kathopaniṣad, holds. This verse may be taken as containing the words of Naciketas, sent by his angry father Vajaśrayaga to the world of Yama 28 donation in the Viśvajit sacrifice. The 2nd verse also contains what Naciketas said viz. that he (at first) looked upon his father in anger, since he (the father) desired to send him (the son) to the ancient pitss in that evil way, but that he (on further consideration) liked ( what the father did ). He liked the idea of facing Yama himself. Verses 3 and 4 are addressed by Yama to the boy Naciketas who approached Yama with prayer (or metaphorically in a chariot). Verae 3 says &lsquo;O boy! the new wheel-less chariot (viz. Țk prayer) with only one beam that you created by your intellect soars up in all directions and that you mount it without seeing (without considering the result of your action).&rsquo; In Rg. a prayer to (and a laud of) gods is often compared to a chariot (as in V. 73. 10, VIII. 3, 15). Therefore, verse 3 suggests two meanings viz. Naoiketas went to Yama in a chariot or that he sent up a prayer to Yama. Verse 4 is spoken by Yama &lsquo;O boył that chariot (i. o. prayer which you sent up from the learned priests on the earth) was followed by Sāman (a melody) from this place (the earth) as if it were placed in a boat. Almost all the verses of the Sāmaveda except about 75 are taken from the Rgveda and therefore the Obān, Up. sayg 2506 therefore Sāman is sung as resting on the śk&rsquo;. As the melody (Pāman) is sung on a sk perse, the Saman is said in this verse (4) as placed in a boat. Verse 4 may also convey another meaning. Sāman also means &lsquo;reconciliation&rsquo; and the verse may be taken as referring to the legend that Yama gave the boy a boon that the boy&rsquo;s father would become well-disposed to him. Verse 5 contains a question (supposed to be asked by Yama). It means &lsquo;who is the father of this boy (meaning probably that the father must be a bad man as he sent his own son to Yama)? Who sent up the chariot? Who would tell me to-day how (this boy) became anudeyi (a small gift accom</p>

<p>panying the large principal gift) ?&rsquo; Then follows the verse on which Mr. Karandikar relies as expressing Karms and rebirth. That verso literally means &lsquo;as it or he became an anudeyi, it stood in front ( or on top); the bottom (or base) was apread in front (or first or to the east), the coming out (or end) was behind (or afterwards or to the west).&rsquo; This conveys no clear sense. But it is possible to explain it in this way, viz, though the boy was sent by his father as an anudeyi (as &amp; subsidiary gift) still he came on top of all (in that Yama was pleased with him and bestowed on him three boobs); he was in front of all though he (boy) was at the bottom of all gifts (i. e. though he came last of all gifts)&rsquo;. There is another possible way of explai ning this verse. Each Sāman in a stotra has five parts called Prastāya, Udgitha, Pratibāra, Upadrava and Nidhana (finale); vide H. of Dh. Vol. II p. 1169 note 2589. Naciketas (who was a subsidiary donation following the donation of all hia father&rsquo;s property and designated &lsquo;anudeyi&rsquo;) is deemed here to have chanted a Sāman; when he began that, the ik verse on which the Saman rests went forth. The bottom of a Sāman is a fk verse. Therefore it is again said that the base or bottom went forward and the &lsquo;Nirayapa&rsquo; (i. e, the nidbana of the Saman) came last. Mr. Karandikar explains verse 6 as &lsquo;the cremation rite of the body of a deceased person shows the two-fold path; by the front path he should go to the highest world or by the hind path he should return to this world&rsquo; (p. 776). It passes the presont author&rsquo;s understanding how this translation follows from the words of verse 6. Verge 7 of the hymn presenta no difficulty; it means &lsquo;this is the house of Yama that is called the the palace of gods; here is played (or blown) the flute (or tube or trumpet) for him (Yama); he (Yama) is embellished with songs (of praise ).&rsquo;</p>

<p>it with a hundred years; he who strikes him (shall atone) with a thousand years; he who sheds the blood of a brāhmaṇa would not know the world of the Fathers for as many years as the number of the particles of dust that would be moistened into a ball by the stream of blood. Therefore a person should not threaten a brāhmapa or strike him or draw blood from his body, since ( in doing so ) so much (sin) is involved.&rdquo; This does not mean that only the world of Fathers had been conceived at the time of this passage (as Deugsen supposes on p. 325 of his Ph. Up.). It will be shown below that even the Rgveda was well aware of both Devayāna and Pitryāṇa. Most men would go to pitsloka presided over by Yama according to the Rg. and only the blessed would go by the Devayāna to the world of gods. This passage is important as conveying that for a very mortal sin the offender would have to suffer for a thousand years or even several thousand years and, therefore, would have to be born for several lives, since one human life was held to extend to one hundred years only (Rg. X, 161, 4 = Atharva III. 11. 4, Rg. 1. 89.9=Vāj. S. 25, 22). Following the above Tai. S. passage, the Gautama Dh. S. provided that threatening a brāhmaṇa in anger would bar going to heaven for a hundred years (or lead to hell for &amp;o), striking him would bar for a thousand years and on drawing blood there would be bar for as many years as the number of the particles of dust that would be made into a ball by the stream of blood. Manu (XI. 206-7) understands that the goveral acts against a brāhmana mentioned therein would lead to the offender being consigned to hell for 100, for 1000 or for thousands of years. Jaimini (III, 4, 17) discusses this passage and holds that the prohibition is not restricted only to Darśapū. raamāsa, but it applies to all brāhmaṇas in all conditions. It is possible to understand by the words • satena&rsquo; and &lsquo;sahasrena&rsquo; as a hundred or a thousand cows (or money). The Tantravar tika refers to this meaning but seems to prefer the idea of connecting the two words with years. Vide H. of Dh. Vol. II. pp. 151-152 where the first meaning was put forward and also A, B, Keith&rsquo;s tr. of the Tai. S, in the H.O.S. vol. I pp. 216-217</p>

Even in the old Testament we find in the Book of Job, chap. 4. 8&rsquo; they that plough iniquity and cow wickedness reap the same'. From the question of the disciples of Jesus as regards a man blind from birth &lsquo;Master! who did sin, this war or his parents that he was boro blind&rsquo; (St. Jobo IX. 2), it appears that the idea of Karma was prevalent among the Jewisb people in the time of Jesus.

<p>Desire, will and deeds fashion future life</p>

<p>(the last rosults) of whatever deeds he does in this world, he re turns again from that world ( where he temporarily went by way of roward) to this world of action; so much with regard to him who is consumed by desires; now concerning the man who has no desires (akāmayamāna); he who is without desire, free from desire, in whose case desires are laid to rest, who is himself his own desire, his vital spirits do not withdraw elsewhere but he, being brahma itself (here), is absorbed into brahina (or attains to brahma). On this point there is a verse: &lsquo;When all hanker ings that found an abode in a man&rsquo;s heart vanish, then he who was liable to death becomes immortal, here (in this body itself) he attains to brahma.&rdquo; In the above passage the sequence is : desire, will and act.</p>
<p>About the grandeur of this paggage it is enough to quote what Deussen (in &lsquo;Philosophy of the Upanishads&rsquo; p. 348) says there follow words than which deeper, truer, more noble were never uttered by human lips. Vide also remarks of Gerald Heard in &lsquo;Is god evident&rsquo; (Faber and Gaber, London) p. 34 &lsquo;Here (in Vedānta and Mahāyāna) is spirituality showing its full fruits; freedom from physical craving, from economic possessiveness, from social desire for recognition and that triple freedom removing all fear! and he hopes that the Vedānta picture, far from being contra dioted, is being increasingly confirmed by modern science.</p>
<p>This sublime passage is proceded and followed by illus trations two of which may be cited for explaining the ocnception of the passage of the soul from one body to another: &lsquo;Just as the caterpillar, having reached the tip of one blade of grass, makes an approach to another blade, draws itself towards it and establishes itself thereon, so this (individual) self, casting down this body in death, dispelling avidyā (ignorance) and making approach to another body draws itself to another body and esta blishes (or identifies itself) therein.&rsquo; This is Br. Up. IV. 4. 3. Another illustration (in Br. Up. IV. 4. 7) is just as the skin (alough) of a snake lies dead and cast-off in an ant-hill, in the same way the body lies (dead and cast-off) and then the self in bodiless, immortal spirit, is brahma only and is light only.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This whole passage (Bp. Up. IV. 4. 5-7) is the leading, the oldest and the clearest passage on the doctrine of trans migration in the Upaniṣads. There are several others of nimilar import. At the end of the story about Yājñavalkya and Artabhāga referred to above (where Yājñavalkya discussed vith Aratbhāga alone in private the question as to what happens</p>
<p>1548</p>
<p>History of Dharmatāsira [Seo. IX, 06. XXXV</p>

These two are the fundamental passages which express the reason and motive that lie at the basis of the doutrine of transmigration,</p>
<p>The gist of these two passages is that works and conduct done in this life fashion a man&rsquo;s future life and that the present birth of a man depends on his actions and conduct in a past life or lives. But works and conduct are the result of volition or will and this last is due to desires. A man may baye several desires, he may curb some of them, but may make a resolve to consummate some of his desires. Therefore, desires (kūma) are the root of volition, of works and conduct and ultimately of the cycle of birth and deaths (that is called &lsquo;samsāra&rsquo;). Hence Saṅkarācārya, following the idea of the verse &lsquo;gadā sarve pramucyanto kāmā&rsquo;(in Bļ. Up. IV. 5. 7) gays &lsquo;Kāmo mālam samsārasya&rsquo; (Kāma is the root of samsāra).</p>
<p>Then there is another important passage in the Bf, Up. VI. 2. There the story is told of Svetaketu, son of Arupi, who being proud of his learning, came to the assembly hall of the Pancālas and saw there Pravābana Jaivali( a kṣatriya or prince) being waited upon by servants. When the prince saw him he asked Svetaketu &lsquo;have you been taught by your father&rsquo;? When Svetaketu replied &lsquo;yes&rsquo;, the prince put to him five questions ViZ. (1) do you know how men when they depart from this world go in separate ( different) directions; (2) Do you know how they come back to this world; (3) Do you know how the yonder world does not become full with many men going there again and again; (4) Do you know at the offering of which obla tion waters become endowed with human voice and rise and speak; (5) Do you know the access to the path called &lsquo;Devayāna &ldquo;2511</p>

<p>and to the path oalled &lsquo;Pitryāṇa&rsquo; (1.e. the deeds by which men gain access to the paths called Devayana ans Pitryāṇa), for we have heard the saying of a sage &lsquo;I heard two paths for men, one leading to the Fathers and the other leading to the Devas; on those two paths all the world that is active moves on, whatever exists between father (sky) and mother (earth).&rsquo; To all these five questions Svetaketu replied that he did not know any one of them. The prince offered hospitality but Svetaketu ran to his father and demanded how the latter could say that he had been thoroughly-taught by him and that he could not answer even one of the five questions that the fellow of a Rajanya asked. Then the father replied that he had taught all that he knew but he himself did not know the answers to those questions. He went to the prince (ksatriya) who honoured him with offerings. Ārupi did not want wealth but the replies to those questions. The prince said como as pupil&rsquo; Aruṇi (Gautama) stated he came as &amp; pupil. The pridice stated that the vidyā2512 that he would teach was never before with any brāhmaṇa. Then he propounds to Svetaketu the anwers to the five questions (to be brief) viz. that the five fires are (figuratively) heaven, god of rain, the earth, man and woman, and the five āhutts (oblations) are sraddhā (faith), Soma (Moon), rain, food and seed. This answers the 4th question. The first and fifth questions are angwered by the statement Some go by the path of Devas, others by that of pitts and others (like flies and worms) know no path (they merely live and die )'; vide Bļ. Up. VI. 2. 15–16. The 2nd and 3rd questions are answered by the same viz. those that go by the path of pitṛs return to the earth and others that go to brahman do not return and therefore the world does not become full.</p>
<p>In the Ch. Up. V. 3. % the questions are put in a slightly &lsquo;different form :(1) do you know to what place mon go from here, (2) how they return, (3) do you know where the path of devas and the path of tbe fathers diverge, (4) why the world never becomes full, (5) why in the 5th oblation water is called &lsquo;man.&rsquo; The answers to these in Bś. Up. and Chāu. Up. are not identical, though very similar. A fire has five constituents, fuel, smoke, flame, live coals, sparks. In both Chān. Up. V.10,4-9 and Bļ. Up. VI. 2. 9-13 the fires are the same, but the constituents of</p>

<p>Before proceeding further some remarks are called for about what might possibly happen when a man&rsquo;s body dies. There are mainly three possibilities, viz. (1) annihilation, (2) endless retribution in heaven or hell and (3) punarjanma (transmigra tion. Those who do not believe in an individual immortal self, including some most eminent 2514 men such as G. B. Shaw, hold the first view and even in ancient India (as the Kathopaniṣad I 20 testifies) there were people who had doubts about survival after death. Those who hold that there is no survival after death are not troubled by other questions. Therefore, the most vital question is the one about survival after death. The very first verse of Sv. Up. puts forward four problems; is brahma the cause, whence do we come, what sustains us and whither we are going? Many of those who believe in God, heaven and hell do not admit pre-existence of the soul but only post-existence. They believe that if a man loads &amp; virtuous career in this life (and virtua according to them consists in obedience to the will</p>

<ol start="2514">
<li>In &lsquo;In search of faith&rsquo;, a &lsquo;symposium&rsquo; edited by E. W. Martin (London, 1943) G. B. Shaw states (pp. 9-10) that he may be described as a creative evolutionist, that he does not believo ia personal immortality and abhors it, that he does sot believe in tbe Resurrection of Jesus. It is difficult for a non-Christian to state definitely the doctrina as to wbat bappons after death, there being many varying interpretations accopted by the Christian Churh at various times and in different countries. But the general traditional scheme is a particolar judgment immediately after death, the general judgment at the general Resurrection, the ultimata issue of judgment being consignment to Hell or admission to Heaven otornally.</li>

<p>&ldquo;Eternal life of bliss or damnation</p>
<p>1551</p>
<p>of God as disolosed to their intellect in Revelation such as the Bible or the Koran) he would have an eternal life of bliss in heaven and that if one lod a life of sin and evil, he would after death remain for ever in hell. Very few accept the first possibllity (annihilation) because it is in conflict with man&rsquo;s cherished desires and with deep-rooted emotional certitude that efforts made in a long life, the mental and spiritual equipment acquired: Cannot have been meant to be dissolved altogether without leaving any trace behind. The 2nd possibility also leads to the prospect of eternal reward or eternal damnation for acts done during a life of a few years&rsquo; span and becomes unacceptable to many by the unparalleled disproportion between deeds (as Gauses) and their endless rewards or retribution (as effects). Therefore, to many people the third possibility of transmigration appeals, since it allows continued existence of the soul after physical death in some other forms and environments,</p>
<p>The above Upanigad passages are enough to show how the dootrine of transmigration was being moulded in the Upaniṣad period. The Rgveda knows the two paths of Devayāna and Pitryāpa and also that in heaven there were joys and delights but the Rgveda does not say how long the joys of Heaven were to last and makes no clear and definite statement on the doctrine of transmigration. In the Brahmana period the two paths were often referred to and the conception had dawned upon the minda of thinkers that man might have to pass through death several times (punarmstyu). But even then there is hardly any definite theory of punarjanma based on good or bad deeds. The clearest statements ( and probably earliest) of the origin of the doctrine of transmigration are the two passages (Bṛ. Up. III. 3. 13 and IV 4. 5-7) in which Yājāavalkya is concerned and is the instructor and emphasizes that it is man&rsquo;s own works and conduct that lead a man to now births. In both those passages the Devayāna and Pitryāṇa paths are not mention ed at all. But the Br. Up. VI. 2. 16 and Chan. Up. V. 10 relate the two paths to transmigration and speak of a third place for those born as worms and flies. This is an addition to the dootrine of the two paths, but they make a further departure, The Chān, Up. V. 10.5 states that those that performa sacrifices, works of public utility and charity go to the moon and when the results of their actions are exhausted after staying in the moon they have to return to this world by the path they went(i, o. from the Moon to ether, then to Vayu, smoke, mist, cloud and rain</p>
<p>1558</p>
<p>and they may be born from a mother&rsquo;s womb.2515 This shows that a double retribution awaits those who perform sacrifices &amp;o. yie. stay in the moon for a time and their rebirth on this earth. Other Upaniṣads follow the Chān. Up. in the theory of double retribution e.g. the Prasna has the following passage in prose: 2516 &ldquo;The year indeed is Prajapati, there are two parts thereof, the southern and the northern. Now those who believe in sacrifice and gifts for public utility as work that must be done, secure the moon only as their ( future ) world and it is they who return to this world. Therefore, the rșis who desire offspring resort to the southern (path). That path of the Fathers is indeed treasure (or wealth). But those who, after having sought the Ātman by austerities, (sexual) abstinence, faith and knowledge go by the northern path to the Sun. This is the home of the vital spirits, it is immortal, free from fear, it is the highest (or final) end. Thence they do not return, that is a check to otber things. On this there is a verse (Rg. I. 164. 12) &lsquo;some call hiri the father with five feet (the five seasons) and with twelve fornis (twelve months), the giver of rain in the highest of heaven; others again say that the sage is placed in the lower half, w the chariot with seven wheels (horses or rays of sun) and six spokee&rsquo;&rdquo;. This verse of the Rgveda is probably quoted here in support of the conception of the two paths symbolisily represented as two parts of the year, as the Rg. Verse (fast half) appears to rofer to the Sun, placed in highest half of deaven and as the second half seems to refer to a lower (upan) half of heaven with sir spokes (i.e. the six months of Daksinayana). Deussen (Ph. Up. p.338) is positiva that Rg. I. 164.1: has nothing to do with</p>

<p>Deussen on Rg. 1. 164. 12 criticized</p>
<p>1553</p>
<p>with the subject of the two paths). But what is there to prevent an ancient sage of the Upaniṣadic times from holding that the verse in its two halves refers (figuratively or symbolically) to two paths, particularly when even in the Rgveda times paths called Devayāna and Pitryāṇa were well-known as shown below? It should be noted that in the preceding verse (I. 164. 11) the wheel of įta (the year or the sun) is Drādaśāra ( with twelve spokes, viz. months) and therefore when ṣadare (with six spokes) is mentioned in I. 164. 12 a period of six months could well have been intended or could very well be got by interpretation.</p>
<p>The Kauṣitaki Up.( I. 2-3), however, speaks only of Devaya na and Pitryāṇa and has no third place for worms and birds &amp;c. and states (vide n 2520 below) that worms &amp;o. also come to the same world to which men return. Further, the stations of the Dova yāna path (Agni, bright half of the inonth etc.) bad been given a counterpart in the Pitryāṇa path in the Bș. Up. and Chāu. Up. which made the moon the point of divergence for the two paths. The Kauṣītaki Up. omits all the preliminary stations up to the moon and brings all transmigrating beings to the moon (in I. 2). There are some other variations also that need not be dwelt upon here.</p>
<p>Deussen (in Ph. Up.p. 318) argues that in the Rg. verse (X.88. 15) the two ways are really to be understood as day and night and he translates that verse as &lsquo;I have heard from my forefathers that there are two ways alike for gods and men&rsquo;, thus giving to the world&rsquo; pitṛnām&rsquo;the sense of the ablative and holding that&rsquo;my&rsquo; is to be understood before pitsṇām, though not to be understood before the other two words in the genitive in the same verse. The mean ing which the Upanigad reads in the Rg. verse is proper and also the original meaning of the verse. The path oalled Pitryāṇa 2517 is mentioned in Rg. X. 2,7 (Agoi knows well the path called pitsýāṇa) and Rg. X. 18. 1 runs &lsquo;O Death! Follow another path which is your own and different from Davayāna.&rsquo; These two Verses olearly show that the Rgvedic sagos had arrived at the conception of paths called Devayāps and Pitryāṇa. Therefore, the express mention of two paths in Rg. X. 88. 15. in connnection with Pits and Devas should be deemed to refer to Pitryāṇa and Dovayāna paths and it is far-fetched to take them as day and</p>

XII. 8. 1.212518 (quoted below) which says that the two ways are those of the gods and pitys and the commentary of Dvivedaganga explains the first half in the same way. Vide also Sat. Br. I.9.3.1-2. Devayana is sometimes used in the plural in the Rgveda (as in III. 58. 5, VII. 38.8, VII. 76.2,x. 51. 5,x. 98. 11). In Rg. x. 15.8 Yama is said to enjoy offerings along with the ancient fore fathers of the sage and in x. 154. 4 Yama is requested to be united with ancient pitṛs, righteous and full of austerities, The Sat. Br. (XIII. 8. 1.5) states that the door to the world of ' the Fathers is in the southwest, while Northeast is the direction of Gods and men (1. 2. 5. 17 and XII, 4. 2. 15). The Atharva veda (XV.12.5.) mentions both Pitryāpa and Devayana paths. Soma, rain, food, retas (semen) may be described as watery, but the question is how the first ahuti &lsquo;sraddha&rsquo; (faith) can be des cribed as an abuti offered in Agni (viz. the yonder world) by the Gods from which king Soma arises (in Chan, Up. V.4,3 and Br. Up. VI. 2.9). This is answered by V. S. 2519 1II. 1.5 and (and at some length) in the Saikarabhasya thereon.</p>

The moon is Verily the door of the heavenly world. Now if a man disowns the moon (i. e. is dissatisfied with life there ) the moon sets him free. But if a man is not dissatisfied then the moon sends him down as rain here (on the earth). And according to his deeds and according to his knowledge he is born again here as a worm, a looust, a bird, a tiger or a lion or a fish, or &amp; snake, as &amp; man or 88 something else in different places.&rsquo; Then I. 3 begins by referring to Dovayāna and I. 4 ends by saying, being frood from good deeds and from evil deeds, he, the knower of brahman, (neuter ) moves towards brahman alone.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In the Kathopaniṣad 2521 Yama tells Naciketas the secret about Brahmavidyā and what the self becomes on the death (of the body) viz. some men go to a mother&rsquo;s womb for an embodied existence while others are transferred into stumps (of trees) according to their deeds and knowlege.</p>

<p>person born of the mind (of Brahma ) comes to them and leads them to the worlds of Brahmā. In these worlds they being exalted, dwell for ages and there is no return (to sannsāra) for them. But they who conquer (attain) worlds by sacrifice, charity and aus terities go to smoke, from smoke to night, from pight to decrea. sing half of the month), from decreasing half month to the six month during which the Sun moves in the south, from these months to the world of the fathers, from the world of the fathers to the Moon, having reached the Moon, they become food and then the Deras feed on them there as sacrificers feed on king Soma as it increases and decreases (in a sacrifice). But when this ( the result of their works done on earth) is exhausted they return to either (ākāśa), from that to Vāyu, from Vāyu to rain, from rain to the earth; on reaching the earth they become food. They are then again offered into the fire called man, from that (i. e, man) they are born in the fire called woman. Theso, making efforts to secure worlds (by sacrifices &amp;c.), again and again repeat coming to this world.

Up. roads those who living in a village practise (a life of) sacrifices, works of public utility (called purta) and almsgiving, go to smoke', but adds these do not reach the year,' and proceeds from the months to the world of fathers, from that world to ether, from ether to the moon, this is king Soma that is the food of Gods (i. e. the gods like or love them). Having dwelt there (in the moon) till their works are exhausted, they return by the same way by which they came i. e. to other, from other to Vāyu, smoke, mist, cloud. (The persons that had performed sacrifices &amp;c) having become clouds come down as rain, are then born as rice and barley, herbs and trees, sesame and māsa beans. Escape from that state ( to that of human be. ings) is beset with extreme difficulties. Whoever the beings (cattle or other animals or man) may be that eat the food :( into which one has been transformed) and beget offspring be (the transmigrating entity ) becomes most like them.'</p>
<p>Chān. Up. on conduct moulding future</p>
<p>1557</p>
<p>One of the most important passages in the Upaniṣads on conduot fashioning the life that would follow is the Chan. Up. V. 10. 7-8 which may be rendered as follows: 2523 Those whose oonduct has been good will quickly attain some good birth, the birth of a brāhmaṇa, of a ksatriya or of a vāisya. But those whose conduct has been evil will quikly attain an evil birth, the birth of a dog or a hog or a cāndāla. Those that do not go by either of the two paths become those small creatures (worms, flies &amp;o) that are continually returning and whose destiny may be said to be to live and die'. Theirs is a third place (apart from the two paths). Therefore the yonder world does not become full. Hence one should be disgusted (with this Samsāra).</p>
<p>It may be stated here that the Bhagavadgitā (VIII. 23-27) also refers to the two paths following one of which a yogin does not return to this world and following the other of which he returns to this world. These are called sukla ( bright) and krśṇa ( dark) gati (in VIII, 26) and śști (in VIII. 27). The former is fire, light,2574 day, the bright half of the month, the six months of the northern path of the sun; those men who have realized brahman when going from this world go to brahman (the absolute)'. The latter path is smoke, night, the dark half (of the month ), the six months of the southern path of the Sun; the yogin reaobing the moon-light by that path returns to this world. The śāntiparva2525 of the Mahābhārata refers to the northern and southern paths, the latter of which is attained by gifts, study of Veda and sacrifices (as in Br. Up. VI. 2. 16 and Chān. Up. V.10.8). The Yājāavalkya-smrti2526 also refers to those</p>

<p>The Vedāntasūtra frequently refers to the doctrine of trans migration, but owing to the limits imposed by available space only a few important autras and their explanations will be get out here. The three sūtras of V. 8. II. 1. 34-36 2527 are of great importance for the theory of transmigration. An objector says &lsquo;to hold that God is the cause of the world does not stand to reason, for, if it be so, God would be liable to the charges of un equal treatment (or dispensation) and cruelty. He creates some that enjoy extreme happiness (like gods and others), some lead an extremely migerable life such as beasts (of burden &amp;o.) and some like men, who enjoy an intermediate position, Boours a modicum of enjoyment. So God may be charged with acting through hatred and love (like ordinary mon). God also produces misory and finally destroys all persons. This aspect (of great cruelty ) appears abhorrent even to evil men. To this the reply is: if god had created inequality in the world at his sweet will and without regard to any other matter, he might have been liable to the two charges of unequal treatment and cruelty. But God has regard to the righteousness (merit) or other wise of beings when he produces inequalities among creatures. The position of God should be looked upon like that of rain, which is the common cause (or factor) in the production of crops of rice and barley, but the difference ( in quality) between rice and barley is due to the varying potentialities of the seeds. God is the common cause in the creation of beaats, men and gods but the inequalities in these are due to the special poten. tialities of each. Saskarācārya relies expressly on two Upa niṣad passages viz. Kaus. Up. ILI. 8 and Bļ. Up. III. 2. 13 &lsquo;punyo vai puṇyena, karmaṇā bhavati pāpaḥ pāpena). The Kauṣ. Up. passage means &lsquo;He 2528 (the Absolute Atman) is not</p>

<p>exalted by good works nor degraded by evil works, but it is He indeed who inspires (a person) to do good works, whom he wishes to lead high over those worlds and it is he who in. spires one to do evil deeds whom he wishes to lead down from these worlds&rsquo;. It will be noticed that the Kauṣitaki bases the attainment of a higher life (or birth) or a lower life on the quality of men&rsquo;s deeds ( just as in Bṭ. Up. III. 2. 13, IV. 4. 5, Chan. Up. V. 10. 7, Praśna 3.7 ). The Gita statos &lsquo;I treat them the same way (with appropriate fruits) in which they come to (or approach) me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another objection is raised to the above proposition contained in V. S. II. 1. 34. The Upaniṣads often state &lsquo;In the beginning there was that only which is one without a second (Chan. Up. VI. 2. 1 sad-ova somyedam agra āsid-ekam ovā dvitiyan). Therefore, befora creation there was no difference between deeds and go there could have been no inequality among the first created beings dependent on difference in deeds. You may say that after difference in deeds arose God has regard to deeds of men, but all beings created in the beginning must have been alike. To this the reply is that samsāra is without beginning (anadi) and that such &amp; conception of the beginning lessness of samsāra stands to reason and is supported by (Śruti) texts.</p>
<p>Another discussion on the working of Karma occurs in V.8. II, 3, 41-42.2529 Acoording to the highest metaphysioal doctrine the Atman is one and all individual selves are really free but they are affected in the empirical state by the Upādhis of buddhi, mind &amp;o, and in that state they are controlled by Isvara (as Anta ryāmin, as Bļ.

<p>History of Dharmatastra · 1 Sec. IX, Oh. XXXV :</p>
<p>receive the fruits of their good and bad aotions through Layara who does not act at his gwent will but has rogard to good or bad conduct.</p>
<p>A few passages about karma and transmigration and stories illustrating how people&rsquo;s minds were affected by them in ancient times may be cited here. The Āp. Dh.2530 8. provides &lsquo;Members of all vargas (olasses) reap (in heaven ) highest and measureless happiness by carrying out their prescribed duties; thereafter (i, e. after enjoying happiness in heaven) they return ( to this world) on account of the (unenjoyed) residue of the results of their actions and secure birth in an ( appropriate ) caste (or family ), beauty of form, charming complexion, power, mental ability, wisdom, wealth, the (blessing of the ) performance of duties and this results in happiness only in both worlds like a wheel. A similar rule applies to the increase of the results of evil acts. The thief of gold, one guilty of brāhmaṇa murder, according as he belongs to the brāhmaṇa, ksatriya or vaibya class, after undergoing torments in hell for a limited time becomes respec tively &amp; candālu, paulkusa or vaina.&rsquo; The Gautama Dharma gūtra bas a passage in very similar words: &lsquo;Members of the varpaṣ (brāhmaṇa and others) and of aśramas (brabmacaria &amp;c) who are devoted to performing the appropriate duties (of their class or stage in life ) enjoy the fruit (heaven) of their actions after death and then by virtue of the residue ( of their actions ) they attain a (new) birth ( in this world ) endowed with a good country, caste, family, life, learning, character, wealth, mental ability and happiness. Those who act contrary to this are ruined by having to resort to many (evil) births.&rsquo; On V, S. III, 1. 8 Saṅkarācārya after quoting Gautama XI. 29 states there is no possibility of the destruction of the effect of an evil deed except by some of the methods prescribed by sāstra (such as expiations and realisation of the Absolute ) and that it is possible that a good deed may begin to yield its reward</p>

<p>Principle of doctrine of Karma</p>
<p>1561</p>
<p>after a long time because it is hampered by the results of an evil deed and quotes a smrti (Mahābhārata ) in support.2531</p>
<p>The principle of the doctrine of Karma is that every act, whether good or bad, produces a certain result or return which cannot be escaped. In the physical world there is the universal law of causation. The doctrine of Karma extends this inexorable law of causality to the mental and moral sphere. The doctrine of Karma is not a mechanical law; it is rather a moral or a spiri tual necessity. It cannot, however, be said that this doctrine is an induction from observod facts nor oan it be asserted that it is ex porimentally verifiable, but it is only a hypothesis or supposition; it is, however, far better than other naive and childlike theories. In the absence of the theory of karma and rebirth it would have to be assumed that the world is arbitrary, that the Creator is not bound to regard the nature of men&rsquo;s actions but may distribute rewards as he pleases or by caprice. This doctrine of Karma em phasizes three things, firstly it regards an existence as a sort of expiation for the doings of a previous existence or existences; secondly, an evil deed cannot be expiated by works of merit but ita punishment must be borne; thirdly, the punishment for wrong is automatic and personal. Under the doctrine of Karma there is no such thing as ohance or luck. When we use those words they correspond to no reality and are a tacit confession of our ignorance or inability to state the cause or causes of what has happened. This doctrine of Karma leads on to the doctrine of transmigration. The results of a man&rsquo;s actions may not happen at once or in the present life. The Adiparva and Manu say2532 * an evil deed does not yield its retribution immediately like &amp;</p>
<p>&amp; cow ( that yields plenty of milk immediately after she is well fed) but returning slowly it outs off the very roots of the perpe</p>

<p>trator.&rsquo; Man&rsquo;s actions in past existences determine or fashion the nature of the present existence and the actions in the present existence taken along with the residue of past actions will deter mine the future existence. This, in short, is the basis of the dootrine of punarjannur. The modifications introduced by texts or popular notions will be briefly dealt with later. The theory of rebirth is as logical as any of the bypothoses that hold the field about what happens after physical death of the body. It is certainly as satisfactory as (or rather more satisfactory than) the theory of absolute annihilation after physical death (held by atheists) or the theory of eternal roward or retribution in heaven or hell (for confirmed criminals of one life). The leaders or exponents of almost all religions hold that God is with them and they generally have never seen (up to at least the 19th century A. D.) any good outside their respective Churches. Hinduism of the Upaniṣads and Gita is the only religion and philosophy that proclaimed thousands of years ago that the man of good deeds is nearest to God on account of his goodness and the man of evil deeds cannot secure divine grace and follow ghip, whomsoever he may regard as a prophet or messiah sont by God.</p>
<p>The Vedāntasūtra in III, 1 examines the passages of the Chān. Up. and of the Bṭ. Up. dealing with Pañoāgnividya. It is not possible to set out in detail the discussions in the bhāṣya of Saṅkara on the sūtras in V, S. III. 1. Some of the important final.conclusions are: The individual self, while passing from one body to another, is accompanied or surrounded by subtle elements (bhūtasūksma), that the abutis are spoken of as &lsquo;āpaḥ (in Chān. Up. V.9. 1) because the human body is full of fluida in the form of chyle, blood &amp;c., because sacred works like Agnihotra &amp;o. are the causes of a new body after death and in those works the principal materials used (such as Soma juice, ghee, milk) are mainly fluid. In the statement that those who perform sacrifices &amp;c. go to the moon by the Pitfyāpa path and that śraddhā is offered as oblation from which Soma that is the food of gods arises, the words &lsquo;food of gods&rsquo; are used in a metaphorical sense (and not in the sense of eating). The souls of sacrificers and the like, after reaching the moon and enjoying the fruits of their good deeds that can be enjoyed in the moon, return to the earth by the way they went but in reverse order of stations for enjoying the fruits of their actions that oan only be</p>
<p>Double requital for sacrificers do.</p>
<p>1569</p>
<p>enjoyed on the earth.2533 This combines the idea of a life beyond (often referred to in the Rgveda) with the notion of rebirth and offers two prizes for good deeds ( Fiz, reward in heaven and then &amp; rebirth with material well-being and cultural environment, as in Gautama Dh. 8. XI, 29 and Gita VI. 37-45 and there is a double penalty for evil deeds (viz, hell torture and then a despised or low life ).</p>
<p>The V. S. (III, 1. 13-17) further explains that all men do not go to the moon, but only those that perform sacrifices &amp;c. and those that do not perform sacrifices or works of public utility but are guilty of evil acts go to the abode of Yama for under going tortures of hell 2534 (which are seven, according to V, S. III.1.15) and after that they come to the earth. Those who follow the path of faith and austerity go by the Devayāna path (Chān. Up. V. 10. 1 and Mundaka I. 2. 11 ) and those who perform sacrifices, charity and works of publio utility go by the pitryāṇa path (Chan, Up. V. 10. 3 and Muṣdaka I. 2. 10)2535 and those that do not follow any one of the two have to go to a third place and be born as worms &amp;c. (Chan, Up. V. 10. 8), that when &amp; śruti text like Kauṣitaki Up. (I. 2) states that all those that depart from this world go to the moon, what is meant by &lsquo;all&rsquo; is all those that have the adhikāra (capability or fitness) to go to the moon.</p>
<p>There is one word, namely sarisara&rsquo;, which occurs frequently in the comparatively later literature on Vedānta and Dharma Śāstra but rarely in the Upaniṣads. It means passing through a succession or a round or a cycle of births and deaths.&rsquo; The</p>

<p>Kathopaniṣad say: 1536 óthat person who has no understanding, who has not controlled his mind, who is always impure, does not attain that (highest) state and undergoes samsūra (birtha and deaths). The Sv. Up. VI. 16 speaks of the Supreme Spirit as the creator and knower of the universe, as self-born, the knower, the destroyer of time, possessing (all) qualities, know ing everything, Lord of Pradhāna, individual souls and the guṇas (sattva, rajas, tamas) and as the cause of release from samsāra, of sustaining it and of bondage,&rsquo; The Maitrāyaṇi Up. I. 4. says &lsquo;such being the nature of samsāra what is the use of the enjoyment (of pleasures)&rsquo;. The Muktikā Up. (II. 37) states &lsquo;mind is established as the root of the tréo of sargāra&rsquo;, The word &lsquo;samsāra&rsquo; occurs in the Vedāntasūtra 2537 IV.2.8. The Bhagavadgitā mentions the word several times e. g. &lsquo;men who have no faith in this way (of life ) do not attain to me (Lord Krsna ) and return to the path of death and transmigration (IX. 3); those whose minds are fixed on me I deliver in no time from the ocean of death and transmigration&rsquo; (XL. 7). The Manusmrti employs the word samsāra frequently e. g. in the table of the subjects to be treated in the Smrti &lsquo;the passing through samsāra&rsquo; is mentioned (in I. 117) and the 12th obap. uses the word often. It is said (in XII. 51)' the entire samsāra of three kinds due to three sorts of Kamma affecting all beings has been expounded'. After describing the various character istics of the three guṇas, sattva, rajas and tamas (in XII. 26–29), and the effects of these guṇas (XII. 30-38), Manu states that those in whom sattva, rajas or tamas preponderates respectively become gods, men or lower animals and again divides each of these three classes into lowest, middling and bighest (XI. 40-50). Manu Uses the word &lsquo;samsāra&rsquo; in the plural (in XI. 52, 54, 70) in the sense of gate' or &lsquo;yoni&rsquo;. In chap. VI. 40-60 Manu first dilates at length on the daily routine of one who has entered on the stage of sannyāsa, what he should wear and carry, how he should maintain himself, how he should restrain</p>

<p>his senses and give up love and hate and practise ahiinsā and then proceeds &lsquo;he should ponder over the destinies of men due to bad deeds, falling in hell and the tortures of hell, separation from loved ones and contact with undesirable persons, the ravages of old age and the pains of diseases, the departing from the body and again lying in the womb and the passage of the soul through thousands of crores of births of all sorts.&rsquo; It is entirely wrong to suppose (as done by Mr. Sanjana on p. 10 of his' Dogma of reinoarnation') that Manu prescribes that each ego has to go through ten thousand millions of existences.' Manu nowhore says so. All that he means is that the Sannyasin desirous of liberation should revolve in his mind the possibility of some souls having to migrate through millions of births. Yāj. (in III, 169) employs the verb samsarati' in the sense of &ldquo;undergoes births' and states &lsquo;The fruition of actions done by some mon results after death (in other bodies) or in this very life ( as in the case of Karli sacrifice) and in some cases either in this world or the next (i. e, there is no hard and fast gāstra rule that fruits of actions result immediately after they are done); it also states in a fine simile 2538 just as an actor, when acting different parts, colours his body in different colours (fair, dark, brown), so the soul assumes various forms ( as short, hunchback, &amp;o.), aggumos different bodies due to the various acts done by it. In Yāj. IIT. 140 the word saṁsāra itself occurs .The soul affected by (or under the influence of) rajas and tamas, wandering in this world and coming in contact with undesirable objects (or mental attitudes ) goes through transmigration (i, e. assumes various bodies). This is in reply to the question in Yāj. III. 129 (1śvaraḥ sa katham bhāvairaniṣtaiḥ samprayujyate). The Śantiparva 2539 remarks &ldquo;there is no doubt that in life there is far more misery than happiness&rsquo;. The Puranas often harp on the theme that sarnsāra is impermanent, abounds in sorrowE and is fragile like a plantain leaf (e.&amp; vide the Brahmapurāṇa * samsāre&hellip;, anitye duḥkhabahule kadalīdalasannibhe' (178. 179).

<p>much of Sanskrit literature but also by medieval saints like Tukaram (who says &lsquo;bappiness is as little as a grain of barley while misery is as big as a mountain&rsquo;) that people have lost zest in life, are unable to put their heart and soul and serious efforts for improving their own lot and the lot of others. It cannot be denied that in India the doctrine of Karma, instead of being a powerful means of urging all men to put great efforts in doing good deeds and a gospel of hope, became in the minds of many confused with fataliam, which led men to beoome feeblo, submissive and disinclined to work hard,</p>
<p>All the above discussion in the Upaniṣads about transmi. gration of the individual self are valid and concerned with the empirical or phenomenal world (samsārāvasthā or vyavahārā. Vasthā) but considered from the highest metaphysical stand point of thorough-going advaita (the parā vidyā of Mundaka I. 1.5-6 or amūrta brahma of Bṭ. Up. II. 3. 5-6) it falls to the ground, since the individual self is non-different from the Absolute Bralıman. Saṅkarācārya on V, S. II, 3. 30 emphasizes this point. He states: As long as the individual self is in sainsāra state and has not attained perfect knowledge and brought the empirical or phenomenal state to an end, so long the connection of the self with buddhi does not cease. As long as this connection with buddhi ( a limiting adjunct) lasts, so long lasts the state of being an individual self merged in sargāra. But the real truth is that there is no entity called jiva by itself except in so far as it is fictitiously hypostatized by buddhi, the limiting adjunct. For, when we determine the real meaning of Vedānta texts, we find no intelligent substance other than the one omniscient Lord whose nature is eternal freedom. Thon Śankarācārya cites certain texts (viz. Bṛ. Up. I. 4. 7, III. 7-13, Chan. Up. VI. 1. 6, VI. 8. 7 2540 and remarks that there are</p>

<p>Badarāyanus composed sutras froin two standpoints</p>
<p>1567</p>
<p>bundreds of such texts. Saṅkarācārya states that even Badarāyana, the author of the Vedāntasūtras, composed some sūtras from the highest advaita standpoint and some from the empirioal standpoint. In the following sūtras of V. 8. Bādarāyana is obliged to differentiate Jiva and Paramātman 1 1. 16–17; I. 1. 21, I. 2. 20, 1, 3.5, 11. 1. 21-23, II, 3. 21. II. 3. 41, II. 3. 43 &amp;o. But the gūtras I. 1. 33, II. 1. 14, IV, 13 indicate that there is non-difference between the two. 2541</p>
<p>The theory of transmigration postulates that each life is the result or fruit of the actions of the preceding existence or existences. It follows from this that if we go backwards far enough, no existence or birth can be the first. Therefore, the Vedāntasūtra had to declare ( in II. 1.35 quoted in n. 2527 above) that samsāra is anādi ( beginningless ). But this is in conflict with many passages of the Upaniṣads, which, in speaking of creation, employ the words ' in the beginning' (as in Chān. Up. VI. 2.1, Bf. Up. I. 4., 1, 10 and 17, V, 5.1, Tai. Up. II. 7. 1). In order to get over this oonflict the conception of the recurring creation of the universe periodically from all eternity was postulated by means of the machinery of kalpas, 2542 which provides that the universe created by brahman persists through a vast period called Kalpa, after the lapse of which it is absorbed into brahman. Vide Santiparva 231. 29–32 (Ch, ed.= c. ed. 224. 28-31). It is stated in the Gitā VIII, 17-19 that the day of Brahmā is equal to one thousand yugas (four yugas make one unit or Mahāyuga ) and the night of Brahma is also of the same duration. All objects spring up from Praksti at the advent of the day of Brahmā and at the advent of night are absorbed (or merged) in the Prakyti. Vide Bhagavadgita IX. 7 also ' at the end of a Kalpa all elements (or beings ) pass into prakrti over which I preside; but when the next Kalpa starts I send them forth'.</p>
<p>The reasoning is; just as we cannot decide which comes first, the seed or&rsquo;sprouting plant, so it is impossible to say which</p>

<p>comes first ( body or Karma), since no body is possible without Karma ( deuds) and no deeds are possible without a body. The Chan. Up. (V.13.2) states that Being ( doity) that had produced fire, water, and earth thought&rsquo; let me enter those three beings (fire, water and earth ) with this living self and then develop names and forms.&rdquo; That shows that Jiva ( the self) was there at the time of creation and thereby indicates that samsāra is beginning loge. The Rgveda in X. 190.3, expressly says the creator arranged (or created ) as before &lsquo;25420 Similarly, the Gitā ( 15.3 ) states the real form of it (of the tree of samsāra ) is not thus perceived, nor its end nor beginning nor its support; having out off this deeply rooted Aśvattha (pippala ) tree with the powerful sword of non-attachment, that place must be sought for from which those who have reached it do not again return&rsquo;. The Smrti verses relied upon by Saṅkarācārya on V. 8. 1.3.30 are noted below.2543</p>
<p>2542a. It is possible that the words &lsquo;dhātā yathāpūrvamakalpayat&rsquo; (in Rg. X. 190.3 ) simply mean that the Creator arranged the Suo, the Moon, Heaven, Earth and regions according to the priorities (or their proper ordor). But it cannot be gainsaid that these words are at least the germs of the later doctrine of Kalpa, Maavantara &amp; C. Sarkarācārya on V. S. I. 3.30 explaios the Rgveda verse as &lsquo;the creator created in the present Kalpa the universe inclading the Sun and the Moon in the same way as in the preceding Kalpa.&rsquo; यथा पूर्वस्मिन्कल्पे सूर्याचन्द्रमाप्रभृति जगत् कृत तथास्मिनपि कल्पे परमेश्वरोऽकल्पयदित्य. He quotes as supporting his views several smrti verses which occur in the Mabābhārata and in some of the Puriṇas.

<p>1569</p>
<p>The Bhagavadgita (VI. 37-45) is very emphatic that no exertions made by a man on the path of Yoga with faith are lost even if he does not quickly attain perfection. Lord Kroṇa replies (VI. 40 ff) that such a man failing to secure perfection does not come to an evil end, but he attains to the worlds of the righteous, dwells there for many years, is born in the houses of prosperous and pure men or is born in the family of wise yoging, where he regains the mental impressions of his past lives. He makes fresh efforts to gain perfection and is carried forward irresistibly by his practice in former lives and being free from all ging and perfecting himself through many lives attains the highest goal. In the Gita, Kroṇa says (in IV, 5) &lsquo;many are my lives that are past and thine also. All of them I know but thou knowest them not.&rsquo; In many places the Gitā touches upon the doctrine of transmigration ( such as in II. 12-13 and 22-27, IV. 8-9, VII, 19, VIII, 6, 15-16, IX. 21).</p>
<p>In chapters 30-32 (of ch. ed.) of Vanaparva there is a dialogue between Draupadi and Yudhisthira, who, having lost his kingdom in gambling with the Kauravas, was in axile and hard pressed. Draupadi wonders how such a straightforward, mild, benevolent and truthful prince allowed his mind to be involved in gambling (30. 19), that God does not act towards beings like a father or mother, but He appears to be irascible like a common man, when she sees that honourable mon of high character bave difficulties in maintaining themselves and dis. honourable men live in pleasures (30. 38-39 ); she proceeds &lsquo;human beings, 2544 ignorant and having no control over happi ness and misery, go to heaven or hell at the caprice of God.&rsquo; Yudhisthira warns her that she talks like an atheist, that he performed no deed with the thought of seeking the reward thereof, that be made gifts and performed sacrifices because he held that it was his duty to do so.' He asked her to give up atheistio talk and not to disrespect Highest God. Then Draupadi came round and replied that she did not mean to dis respect or censure Dharma, that it is far from her thoughts to show disrespect to God, but that, being distressed, she talked like an atheist. She then enters upon a discussion 2545 about</p>

<p>All strata of Hindu society were permeated by the theory of Karma and trangmigration. Great Sanskrit poets often allude to it. In the Raghuvamsa XI. 22 desoribing the visit of Rāma to the hermitage of Vāmana pointed out by Viśvāmitra, Kālidāsa remarks &ldquo;Rāma became restless (or disturbed) in mind, though not remembering his actions in the former existence as Vamana' (both Vāmana and Rāma being avatāras of Viṣṇu). Similarly, in Sakuntala (Act V) the poet remarks &lsquo;when on seeing charming sights and hearing pleasing words, &amp; person, though surrounded by pleasures, becomes restless (or sorrowful), that is indeed due to this that his mind unconsciously has the impressions of loves and friendships of past liyon presented to it&rsquo;. In the seventh Act of the same play when Duṣyanta and Śakuntala were re-united, she, referring to her previous rejection by the king, remarks 2549 &lsquo;indeed at that time some (bad) actions of mine (in some former life) hampered my good deeds and became ripe for fruition&rsquo;. In the Raghuvamsa the 14th canto contains at first a message of spirited protest by Sita whom Rāma ordered Lakṣmaṇa to abandon near Valmiki&rsquo;s hermitage on account of the scandal about her among common people, but afterwards qualifies the message by saying that the terrible misfortune that she was going to suffer was the fruition of her misdeeds in former existences and that she desired to be his wife in a future existence but without separation from him.

<p>(8ac. IX, Oh, XXXV</p>
<p>Many questions naturally arise on the doctrine of Karma and transmigration. One of them is discussed by the bhāṣya of Vyāsa on Yogasūtra II. 13. in Yogasūtra II. 3 five kledas (hindrances) such as aridyā (nescience) are enumerated and it is stated (II. 13 ) that these kleśas lead on to fruition of actions by way of birth, life ( long or short ), kind of experience. Actions (Karma) are of four sorts according to Yogasūtra (IV. 7) viz. krsna (dark found in wicked people), (2) sukluktsna (white dark) that are accomplished by external means in which there is some injury to or benefit of others; (3) śukla (white) belonging to those who engage in tupur, gyadhyāya ( study of the sacred texts) and contemplation; because this kind of deed depends on the mind alone and does not depend on external means and does not involve injury to others; (4) Asuklūktsna (neither white por dark), which is found in sanngāsins (ascetic saints) whose hindrances (avidyā &amp;c) have dwindled and whose bodies are the last (they will have). Of these four kinds, the yogin alone has non-white karma since he has renounced the fruit of all actions (even of good ones) and he has akrsna since he will never resort to dark actions. The bhāṣya on Yogasutra II, 13 states four questions, (1) whether one Karma is the cause of one birth, or (?) whether one Karma is the cause of more births than one;-(3) whether more than one Karma brings about more births than one; (4) whether more than one Karma brings about one birth. The bhāsya raises objections to the first three and states that the fourth alternative alone is acceptable. Vide p. 1417 note 2325 for the text of the Yogabbāṣya on these four alternatives. The Sāntiparva (chap. 273. 33–34 of or, ed. =chap 280. 33–34 of ch.ed.) mentions individual souls as of six colours viz. krsu (dark), dhūmru/grey), nila (blue), rulta (red), haririta (yellow) and śukla (white) in an ascending order, the dark being the lowest and sukla being the highest and verses 36-46 desoribe these six in detail.</p>
<p>There are several features of our present life that can be more satisfactorily explained on the theory of transmigration than on any other. Why do two people who have seen but little of one another feel friendship or hatred? The surmise that in past existences they were friends or had obliged each other or harmed each other offers an explanation. The doctrine of karma and transmigration accounts for the apparently unmerited misery and suffering of many people, while some enjoy undeserved happiness or a good life. Our Senge of fairness and justice would</p>
<p>Arguments in favour of doctrine of Karma</p>
<p>1573</p>
<p>be shocked by the inequalities in the world, if such a doctrine were not there. The hypothesis and belief that all human volition and conduct will suitably be rewarded and punished in subsequent existences has an important bearing on present conduct, would act as an urge to continual effort for good ness in this life and is likely to deter men from vice and cruelty. This doctrine of karma not only offers an explana tion about the varying degrees of happiness and unhappiness among human beings, but also accounts for differences in material well-being and unhealthy bodily conditions. It offers a solution of the problem of evil in the world and explains precocious abilities in mathematics, music and arts among children and grown up men as in the case of Ramanujan about whom Prof. Hardy of Cambridge (in &lsquo;Ramanujan,&rsquo; Cambridge, 1940 ) says that he was the most romantic figure in the recent mathematics. If rightly understood, it is not pessimistic or fatalist, but rather emphasizes all out human effort in this life. It will be seen how many of the works on Dharmaśāstra or connected with it as sources emphasize effort ( puruṣakāra ) as against views of various people that it is Daiva or Svabhāva or time or the combination of all these that yield rewards or retribution in this life. It also explains sudden accession of prosperity or bigh position such as, for example, a poor man&rsquo;s son being adopted by a prince or queen and then becoming an enlightened and famous ruler as was the case with the late Sayajirao Maharaj Gaikwad of Baroda.</p>
<p>Even from Upaniṣadio times various views were held about the origin of the world and similar questions. The śv. Up. (I. 1) asks the question &lsquo;Is brahma the cause? Whence ar: we born? Whereby do we live and whither are we going. Tell us, O knowers of brahman, under whose control do we abide in pain or pleasure&rsquo;? The next verse states &lsquo;Should Time or nature or necessity or chance or the elements be considered as the cause or He who is (called) Puruṣa ? It cannot be their combination either, since even the self has no power over happi ness and misery.&rsquo; Then verge 3 (latter half) states &lsquo;He being one superintends (or controls) all causes viz. Time, self and the rest.&rsquo; Yaj. I. 350 refers to five views on the question as to what causes desirable or undesirable results viz. some hold that it is Daiva alone, some put forward Svabhāva (nature), some rely on Time, sone on human effort and some on a combination of all these; but, Yājñavalkya&rsquo;s own view (I. 349, 351) is that</p>
<p>1574</p>
<p>[ Soo. IX, Oh. XXXV</p>
<p>good or bad results are due to duira and purusakāra and that the former is nothing but effort of former existences that has begun to manifest results. The Santiparva (chap. 238. 4-5=or, ed. 230. 4-5 ) refers to the fact that there are three views viz. either human effort or daira or suabhūra being the cause, but its own view appears to be that Purusakāra and Daiva combine to produce fruits. The Matsyapurana (221, 8) asserts that daira, effort and kāla working together produce the fruits of actions. The Brahmandapurana (. 8. 61-62) refers to three viows viz. Daiva, effort and Svabhāva are put forward as causes separately but its own view is that daiva and effort together yield fruits.</p>
<p>It may be stated here that Karma is put in three groups viz. sancta, prūrabdha and kriyamāṇa (or sañolyamāna). The first is the total accumulated deeds of all past existences, the fruits of which have not been experienced. The prārabdha Karma is that which was the strongest among the group of sancita deeds just before the present existence of a person begins and which is supposed to determine one&rsquo;s present existence. What a person accumulates during the present existence is called kriyamāna (or sañciyamāna, being collected ) and the next existence is determined by the strongest (or the earliest according to some ) among the sancita and kriyamāṇa deeds put together. As the karmans 2550 are of different characters and yield different consequences ( heaven in case of sāttvika deeds, or the earth or mid-regions when they are mainly rājasa ), and places of tortures when deeds are mainly tāmasa the existences (or births or bodies ) differ and the self being affected by the body, the individual souls appear as different. The objection is raised that freedom of will is the basis of all ethical values and that if a man&rsquo;s Karma in past lives determines the present life, then a man in the present life is morely a toy in the power of Karma and has no power to do as he sees best. The question about a man&rsquo;s freedom of will is a most thorny one, on wbich the greatest thinkers from ancient times to the present day have differed 2551 and no</p>

<p>satisfactory reply can be given. There are numerous works on discussions on Free will and Determinism such as Rashdall&rsquo;s * Theory of good and evil' vol. II. pp. 302-355 (1907) on Free Will,' Bergsons&rsquo;s Time and Free will,' Viscount Samuel in * Belief and action. pp. 303-320; but the present author does not propose to recommend any of these books to the reader of this volume. But if the reader wants a small book on the Free Will controversy he may read the book by M. Davidson (London, 1942). So far as the Indian doctrine of Karma is concerned, it appears that freedom of will is postulated for a man during the present existence to lead a good moral life and perform meritorious acts subject to the limitations caused by the environment in which the present existence is cast. The important working belief is that one has free will and that one is free in the present existence to mould the future ( 80 far as he is concerned ) by means of meritorious works. This is the message of the Santiparva.2552 Lord Kșspa, after a long discourse in the Bhagavadgita gives Arjuna permission to do as the latter likes (18.63' yathecohasi tathā kuru'). In Gitā 9.30 also Lord Krṣpa says if even a person of the vilest conduct worships me with undivided devotion, he must be held to be righteous, for he has made a right resolve.' Similarly, in VI. 5 the Gitā provides</p>
<p>let a man lift himself bigher by himself, let him not degrade himself; for the self alone is the friend of the self and the self alone is the enemy of the self'. Vide notes below for Upaniṣad passages, V. S. and Saṅkarabhāsya. It is possible to accept, on the ancient Indian doctrine, both predestination and free will, the first so far as one&rsquo;s being born in a certain environment is concerned and the 2nd so far as one&rsquo;s actions in the present life are concerned. The Bhagavadgitā (VI. 5-6 ) holds out the hope even to a sinner that it is never too late to mend and (II, 40 ) avers that even a little of righteousnegg saves a man from great fear and no effort is lost.</p>
<p>Though the general drift of the Gitā is in favour of Free Will, there are a few passages that seem to bavour of determinism, e.g.' everyone is made to do acts helplessly by the gunas born of Prakṛti ( III, 5); &lsquo;all beings follow praksti (Nature); what can control (or repression) do&rsquo;? (III. 33); * due to your conceit you think &lsquo;I shall not fight,&rsquo; this thy resolve is vain; (your) Nature will compel you to do it ; you being constrained 2552. आयुर्न सुलभ लभ्या नावकर्ष विशांपते। उत्कर्षार्थ प्रयतते नरः पुण्येन कर्मणा ।</p>

<p>by your own acts born of your nature will helplessly do that which you do not wish to do&rdquo;(XVIII. 59-60). It may have to be conceded that there is no freedom of will in the matter of environment during childhood.</p>
<p>The Rāmāyaṇa gives expression to the belief that sorrow in the present life is the result of similar actions done in past life or lives. When Rāma left Ayodhyā as an exile for the sake of fulfilling the promise giren to queen Kaikey! by king Dasaratha, Kausalya, mother of Rāma, laments &lsquo;I believe indeed that in a past life I must have made many persons lose their sons or I must have harmed (or killed) living beings; it is therefore that this ( sorrow) has befallen me&rsquo;; &lsquo;I think beyond doubt that in a former life, I, a wretched woman, must have cut off the breasts of cows (or mothers) when their calves (or children) desired (to drink milk at the breasts) of their mothers&rsquo;. 2533</p>
<p>The Purāṇas also emphasize the importance of good or evil deeds and say that one has to reap the fruits of one&rsquo;s actions, whether good or evil, and Karma does not come to an end even after hundreds of lives unless the results thereof are undergone. 2554 The Padmapurāṇa states there is no destruction of Karma except by reaping the fruits thereof; no one can set aside the bondage due to the Karma of past lives' and further man by his own actions may become a God, or a human being, cattle, a bird or a lower animal or even a tree (or rock); no man in this world is able to annul the effects of actions done in previous existences by his power or by the birth of progeny ' 2555 (son &amp;c).

<p>Buddha and the doctrine of Karma</p>
<p>1577</p>
<p>idea of transmigration as desoribed in the Upaniṣada had become universal in India at the time of Buddha. Buddha rejected the reality of a permanent ego or self as an entity. He was not a metaphysical philosopher, but wanted to lay down a way or method by which mankind could be freed from ignorance and suffering and liberation could be achieved. Therefore, while rejecting a permanent ego he accepted the doctrine of rebirth.</p>
<p>A side issue has been very much debated by some eminent scholars, viz. whether the cherishers of the Vedānta thoughts were originally the Kṣatriyas and not the Brāhmaṇas. The prosent author dealt with that question in a brief compass in H. of Dh. vol. II. pp. 105-107 and note 222. Deusion in ‘Das System des Vedānta&rsquo; (1883 pp. 18-19) and Ph. Up. (tr. by Geden pp. 18-19) and Dr. R. G. Bhandarkar in &ldquo;Vaiṣpavism and Saiviam &lsquo;p. 9 hold the view that the ksatriyas were the original Possesseors of Vedānta doctrines. Deussen relies mainly on six passages and Dr. Bhandarkar on two only (Chān. V. 3 and 11) and besides Deussen (in Ph. Up. p. 19) admits that his conclu sion is not absolute certainty but has a high degree of probability. Barth in &lsquo;Religions of India&rsquo; p. 65, Hopkins in * Ethics of India&rsquo; (1924) p. 63, Vedic India' by Macdonell and Keith (vol. II, p. 206), and Tuxen on The religions of India' (Copenhagen, 1949, p. 88 ) do not subscribe to this view. Deussen wont so far as to aver (p. 19) this teaching with regard to the at man was studiously withheld from them (the brāhmaṇas), that it was transmitted in a narrow circle among the ksatriyas to the exolusion of the brāhmaṇas'. The present author had not set out the passages on which reliance was placed by Doussen and those who followed him. They will be set out hore and will be examined as to the context in which they appear and the subject with which they deal. But it must first be emphasized that the most important doctrines of the main and ancient Upaniṣads are two, viz. &lsquo;non-difference of the individual self from the Supreme Self, and (2) transmigration of the self depending on his deeds and conduct. Both these doctrines are expounded by Yājāavalkya to king Janaka in various places in the Upaniṣads e. g. in Br. Up. IV, 4. 4-7 and following paggages. Deussen regards this part of the instruction as deepest, truest and noblest (Ph. Up. p. 348: quoted above on p. 1547) and this passage is (acc. to him) the leading passage on the dootrine of transmigration and on what accompanies the self in its trans migration (Ph. Up. p. 281). Besides, the words of Yajñavalkya</p>
<p>1, D. 198</p>
<p>1578</p>
<p>History of Dharmadāstra 1880, IX, Ch. XXXV</p>
<p>in Bṛ. Up. III. 2. 13.He who does good is born good&rsquo; and in IV. 4. 5&rsquo;He who does good is born good, he who does evil is born evil, he becomes righteous by righteous works &amp;c.' are declared by Doussen himself (Ph. Up. p. 410) as &lsquo;the oldest in which a doctrine of transmigration is found&rsquo;. Therefore, according to Deusgen himself, the original possessor of these two fundamental doctrines of the Upaniṣads is the brābmana Yājāavalkya who in the same Upaniṣad (Bp. Up. II, 4. 1-14) propounds to his wife Maitreyi the identity of the self and elements and everything else with brahma (idam saryam yadayamātmā). Not only 30, there are other brāhmaṇa teachers of these. For example, Uddalaka Aruṇi expounds at great length to his son Svetaketu the doctrine of identity in the famous words &lsquo;tat-tvamasi&rsquo; (Chān. Up. VI. 8-16).</p>
<p>Now the examples on which Deussen (Ph. Up. pp. 17-19) bases his couclusions must be cited and examined. Chān. Up. (V. 11. 1) tells the story of five (named) wealthy householders and great students of Veda who came together and discussed the question what is our ātman, what is brahma'. They proposed to go to Uddālaka Āruṇi who know the self called Vaisvānara. Uddalaka thought that he would not be able to explain all and therefore told them that Aśvapati Kaikeya (king of Kekaya country) at that time know the self called Vaiśvānara and all five together with Uddālaka went to that king, who said he would give an answer the next day. The next day those six went to him with fuel in hand (i. 0. as pupils) and the king without performing further preparatory rites asked each of them what they medidated upon. When each replied as to what he meditated upon, such as heaven, Aditya, air, ether, water and earth (this last by Uddalaka Āruni), he told them that all those are parts of Vaisvānara and he explained to them how the proper Agnihotra is to be performed.</p>
<p>Two things should be noticed viz. Uddalaka Āruṇi ia hero shown as ignorant of true Vaisvānaravidyā, though in the very next section (Chān. Up. VI. 8, 7. ff.) Uddalaka Aruṇi teaches the sublime doctrine of. Tat-tvamasl'. Probably these two Uddalakas are different or the present story is more or less a myth. In the Becond place, all that Aśvapati Kaikeya teaches is about Vaiśvānara and not brahmavidya (about the identity of in dividual soul with the Supreme Self. From before the times of Yaska, there have been various opinions about Vaiśvānara, frequently mentioned in the Rgveda (e. g. in I. 52. 6. I. 98. 1.). The Nirukta (VII, 21-23) has a long discussion and quotesWhat is Vaisvānara-vidya</p>
<p>1579</p>
<p>three different views viz. tbat Vaisvānara is lightning or Aditya or terrestrial fire. The Chan, Up.(V. 18.2) winds up the description of Vaiśvānara and brings it (V. 19-24) in line with the oblations to five breaths (as &lsquo;Prāṇāya&rsquo; gvāhā &amp;c.) and sets forth the results of the observance of Agnihotra with full know ledge of its true purport. The Vedāntagūtra (I. 2. 24–32) deals with what is meant by Vaiśvānara in Chān. V. 11 f, and the conclusion is that it means paramātman ( the highest Self) and not individual self or fire as an element or the digestive (stomach) heat.</p>
<p>Deussen then refers to the story of Gārgya Bālāki ( in Bṛ. Up. II. 1) who offered to expound brahma to Ajātaśatru, king of Kāsi, who offered to give a thousand cows if he did go and remarked that people run exclaiming Janaka, Janaka' (mean ing Janaka is donor and also listener to brahma exposition). 2556 Bāiāki offered twelve objects of meditation on brahma such as the person in the sun, the person in the moon &amp;c, Ajātaśatru replied as to the twelve objects that he knew them already and brahma is different from them and cannot be understood by what he said. Then Bālāki remained silent. Bālāki offered to be his pupil. Then Ajātasatru said 2557 &quot; this is topsy-turvy that a brāhmaṇa should approach a ksatriya as a pupil with the idea</p>
<p>the kṣatriya would expound Urahnan to him, I shall make known to you (brahma).&rdquo; So saying he took hold of Bālāki&rsquo;s hand and got up (from his seat ). Certain matters in this story must be carefully noted here. This does not at all say that the class of brāhmaṇas did not know brahmavidya and that ksatriyas alone were then the only possessors of it. On the contrary, Janaka is specially mentioned as a donor of cows and is eager to listen to brahmavidyā and people ran to him desiring to accept large gifts of cows for imparting brahmavidyā. We</p>

<p>know about Janaka from Bf. Up. III. 1 ff. wherein Janaka king of Videha, offered a thousand cows and, when Yājñavalkya took away those cows, numerous persons present in Janaka&rsquo;s court such as his hotṛ priest Aśvala, Artabhāga, Gargi, Uddalake Aruṇi, Vidagdha Sākalya ply him with questions. In Bṭ, Up, IV. 4,7 (Janaka offers a thousand cows to Yājñavalkya, in IV. 4.23 (Janaka offers to give his Videha kingdom to Yājñavalkya along with himself as a slave ). The story of Bālāki only comes to this at the most that when Janaka had learnt brahmavidyā, a brābmapa Bālāki did not know it though he professed to know it, and had to be instructed in it by king Ajātaśatru of Kāśi, who know it and who only stated that a brāhmana did not become a pupil of a ksatriya. All brāhmṇas could never have been proficient in brahmavidyā much less kṣatriyas. One regrets to say that Deugsen is guilty of making a sweeping generalisation without adequate data. It may be noted that in this story Ajātaśatru of Kāśi does not say that the Vidyā was not known to any brāhmaṇas before (as Pravāhaṇa Jaivali claimed ), but, on the contrary, expressed surprise that a brāhmaṇa should come to him for learning the Vidyā.</p>
<p>The game story occurs in Kauṣitaki Upanisad 2538 IV.1-19 often in the same wordsBālāki offers 16 explanations about the objects of his meditation. The V. S. devotes three gūtras (1. 4. 16-18) to the passage in which Ajātasatru stated &lsquo;He who is the maker of those persons ( you mentioned ), he of whom all this is the work, he alone is to be known&rsquo;. There is in Bṛ. Up. II, 1 and Kausitaki Up. IV hardly anything about trans migration. Both passages simply affirm that from the Atman all prāpas, all worlds, all gods, all elements spring forth (Br. II. 2. 20 ). This is nothing more than what is stated in the leading text (Bṭ. Up. IV. 4.7) of Yājñavalkya or in Chān. Up. VI. 1-16 in the oft-repeated words of Arupi to his son Svetaketu (aitadatmyam idam sarvam&hellip;tattvamasi).</p>
<p>It is most surprising that Deussen should press into service the story of Sanatkumāra and Nārada in order to fortify his proposition that ksatriyas were the original possessors of the great doctrines of Vedānta. He relies on Chān. Up. VII, where</p>

<p>Sanatkumora and Narada in Chān. Up.</p>
<p>1581</p>
<p>it is said that Narada approached Sanatkumāra and prayed *Teach me, Sir.&rsquo; Sanatkumāra said to him ' tell me what you know; then I shall tell you what is beyond that'. Narada stated (in Chān. Up. VII. 1-2) that he had studied the four Vedas, 2559 Itihāsa-purāna and gave a long list of lores includ ing Dovavidyā, Brabmavidyā (whatever that may mean), ksatravidyā, Nakṣatravidyā, admitted he knew mantras only and did not know Ātman (the Self) and added &lsquo;I have heard from men like you that he who knows the Atman overcomes sorrow. I am in sorrow; bhagavan I do help me to cross (to get over) my borrow. Sanatkumāra replied whatever you have studied is mere Dame, there is something better than a name&rsquo;. Then Sanatkumāra teaches him to meditate on speech as better than name, then on manas as better than speech and Beveral others as better than the preceding (in VII. 4–24) till ho reaches bhūman (the Infinite, the Paramātman) and describes bhūman in VII. 25–26 ending with the words &lsquo;all this springs from the Self&rsquo; and it is stated at the end (in VII. 26. 2) * Bhagavān (veporable) Sanatkumāra showed to Nārada, all whose blemishes had been crushed (uprooted), what is beyond darkness ( avidyā); they call him ( Sanatkumāra) Skanda. 2560</p>
<p>In all this long passage there is not a word whether Sanat kumāra and Nārada belonged to a brahmana or ksatriya class. Skanda is known in classical Sanskrit as the God of War (as in Gitā X. 24 &lsquo;Senāninām-abam Skandaḥ&rsquo;) and in the Vana parva 229. 22–23 he is mentioned as the commander of the armies of gods and the Santiparva mentions that Nārada approached Devala for knowledge about the creation and dissolution of the world (chap. 275 = 267 of Or, ed.). From this Deusson at once draws the conclusion that Sanatkumāra must have been a kṣatriya and Nārada a brāhmaṇa. In the Mahābhārata, Manu smrti and the Purāpas both of them are semi-divine sages and beyond varna or caste. Gita X. 13 speaks of Narada as Dovarsi, the Vayu-purāṇa speaks of Parvata and Nārada as sons of Kasyapa and as included among Devarsis (Vāyu 61. 85). The Manusmrti includes Nārada among the first ton Prajāpatis</p>

The Brahmapurāṇa (I. 46-47) describes both Skanda and Sanatkumāra as sons of Brahmā, The Nāradiyapurāṇa (Pūrvabhāga, 2. 3) speaks of Sanaka, Sanandana, Sabatkumāra and Sanātana as the mind-born song of Brahma and Sanat kumāra as brahmavādin and as expounding all Dharmas to Nārada. The Vāmanapurāna (60.68–69) describes the same four as sons of Dharma and Ahimsā, and as exponders of Yoga. śāstra. To crown all, Kūrmapurāṇa 2561 I. 7. 20-21 speaks of these four along with Kratu as Vipras (brāhmaṇas), yogins, and as mind-born sons of Brabmā. Sanatkumāra might have been literally or metaphorically called &lsquo;Skanda&rsquo;, because he attacked and routed Audya just as God Skanda routed armies of asuras, if at all the myth about Skanda was known in times before the Upaniṣads.</p>
<p>Chān. Up. I. 8 narrates that there were (in some part of India not mentioned ) three persons well versed in (the osoterio meaning of Udgitha i. e. Om ), viz. Silaka Śālāvatya, Caikitāyana Dalbhya and Pravābana Jaivali. They sat down for a discussion on Udgitha. The first two (who were brāhmaṇas) first put questions to each other and answered. Then Pravābana Jaivali told them that they were giving replies about matters that were not permanent. Then Pravāhana Jaivali told them that Ākāśa was the origin of this world, that beings owe their origin to Ākāśa and will return into it, that Ākāśa is Udgitha, greater than the great and without ond &amp;c. Doussen relies on this passage also for supporting his theory. Udgithavidyā is only one of soveral Upāsanās in the Upanisads. Therefore, what would follow is that Pravahana Jaivali know it and two brābmanas of some place not mentioned did not know it. It is not possible to see how this story lends any support to Deussen&rsquo;s sweeping thesis of all brāhmaṇas being originally excluded from the central doctrine of identity. In the same context (Chan. Up. I, 9,3) Pravāhapa mentions that one Atidhanvan Saunaka2563 taught Udgitha-vidyā to Udaraśāndilya.</p>

<p>Deussen on Udgithavidyā criticized</p>
<p>1583</p>
<p>Deusgon without giving any reason asserts&rsquo; the names allow of the conjecture that in this case also a brāhmaṇa received instruction from a ksatriya &lsquo;(p. 18). He probably connected the first name with dhanus&rsquo; (bow) which was the forte of ksatriyas. But he forgets that saunaka and Sandilya are both brāhmaṇa names. This will illustrate how even the most profound scholar goes astray when he becomes over-enthusiastic about a theory of his. In this story Pravāhaṇa does not claim that the Udgitha vidyā was unknown among brāhmaṇas. On the contrary he himself states that Saunaka, a brāhmaṇa (called Atidhanvan) expounded that Vidyā to Udaraśāṇdilya, another brābmaṇa, Besides, Udgithavidya is only one among numerous upāsanās and what Pravāhaṇa teaches is that all bhūtas spring from Akāśa and are absorbed in Akaśa, the purport being that Akāśa here denotes brahman as the V.S. (I, 1.22) establishes. This doctrine is the same as the one taught in Tai. Up. III. 6 (basis of V.S. I. 1.2) and other texts. Moreover, there is nothing about transmigration in this passage of Chān. Up.</p>
<p>The sheet anchor of the views of Deussen and Dr. Bhandarkar are the dialogue between Pravāhapa Jaivali and Svatakatu ( Bṛ, Up. VI. 2, Chṛn. Up, P.3-10 ) about Pañoāgni vidyā and that between Asvapati Kaikeya and Uddalaka Āruni about Vaiśvānara (Chān. V, 11.24). The latter has been already dealt with. In the former oocurs an important paggage which has been made much of and misunderstood. Before proceeding to expound the Pancāgnividyā to Svetaketu and his father Aruṇi Gautama, Pravāhana Jaivali remarks ( Chān. Up. V.3.7) this vidyā did not go to brāhmaṇas before you; therefore in all worlds domination (or government) has remained with the kṣatriya class alone'. In the corresponding Br. Up. passage the words are' this vidyā did not reside in any brāhmana before this day, but I shall expound it to you, for, who would like to refuse when you address me thus' 2563 ( vim.

<p>Kauṣitaki Up. I. the dootrine of the two paths of Devayana and Pitryāṇa is expounded to Aruni (and his son Svetaketu) by Citra Gārgyāyapi ( v. 1. Gangyāyani), but the remarks about kṣatriyas alone being the first possessors of the doctrine do not occur there at all and Gargyayari appears to be a brābmaṇa teacher. The question is: what is meant by this vidyā&rsquo; in the above passages of Chān, and Bṛ. Upaniṣads? In the Upaniṣads (particularly in Chāndogya and Bṛ.) numerous vidyās for the upāsanā of brahman by men that are not yet far advanced on the path of brahmaridya are dilated upon, such as Udgithavidya (Chan. Up. I. 8-9, Br. Up. I. 3), Daharavidyā (Chān. VIII. 1. 1-2, Bṛ. Up. 1.3, Vedāntasūtra 1, 3, 14-21), Madhuvidyā (Chān. III. 1. 1 ff., Bṛ. Up. II. 5. 1-15), Samvargavidyā (Chan. IV.3). In the same way Pancāgnividya is an Upāsanā. Deusson and others admit ( as shown above ) that the great and original texts about the identity of the individual self with the Supreme Self and about transmigration of the soul based on works and conduct are those of Yājāavalkya in the Bṛ, Up. The Pancāgaividyā expatiates upon and is concerned mainly with only one aspect of transmigration via, the path of those who living in a village practise a life of sacrifices, works of public utility and alms. The five fires and five offerings relate only to the pitļyāṇa path. It contains an esoterio and semi-physical explanation of the process by which persons oome to be born again on the earth. At the most it may be argued that some ksatriya rulers or noble men claimed to have given an esoteric or metaphorical explanation of the mode of the return of pious mon from the moon to the earth again. Nothing positive is said as to whether Pravāhana Jaiyali was the ruler of a country or only a kṣatriya (rājanya in Br. Up. VI. 2.3, Chin. Up. V. 3,5 ) but we are told that Asyapati was king of the Kekaya country in the extreme northwest of India, while the original proclaimer of the immorta. lity of the self and its identity with the supreme self was Yajna valkya who was in Videha (Mithilā, modern Bihar), which was at least a thousand miles away from Kekaya. Yājāavelkya&rsquo;s philo sophy must have taken a long time before it became well known in the distant Kekaya. Conceding for argument that a few rulers like Aśvapati were the first to propound an explanation of the</p>
<p>(Continued from last page) (teaching). Further, this sentence (in Chan, V.3, 7. is a boastful assertion like the one of Aśvapati in Ohan, V. 11. 5. that there was in his country of Kekaya no thief, no miser, do drunkard, ag man who had not consecrated sacred fire in his house, ao igagrant person and no adulterer.</p>
<p>Inferences from Aśvaputi&rsquo;s words criticized</p>

<p>way of the transmigration of pious sacrificers and the like, it is &amp; far cry from that to assume as Deussen does (Ph. Up. p. 20 ) that the doctrine of the Ātman as the first Prinoiple of tbe universe was fostered and progressively developed by the kṣatriyas in opposition to the principles of the brahmanical ritual and this assumption is contrary to what he himself states elsewhere in his own work ( pp. 410, 281, 348 ).</p>
<p>Before proceeding further a passage from the Bṭ. Up. I. 4. 10 and another from the Ait. Up. (II. 4-5) would have to be considered. In Bs. Up. occurs the following passage : 2564 &ldquo;In the beginning brahman was there, it cognised itself as &lsquo;I am brahma&rsquo;; therefore it became all; whoever from among the Gods perceived this (viz. &lsquo;I am brahman&rsquo;), he became that (brahman); the game occurred to sages and mon. The sage Vāmadova realizing this reached the conclusion &lsquo;I was (or became) Manu and the Sun also. Therefore, this ( will ocour) even now. Whoever (oven a man) who realizes &lsquo;I am brahman he becomes (identical with all this (universe); even the gods are not able to prevent that man&rsquo;s being one with brahman and with all, for he is the soul of all these.&rdquo; Deussen translates</p>
<p>aham Manurabhayam Būryaśca&rsquo; as &lsquo;I was once Manu, I was once the Sun&rsquo;. There is no word for &lsquo;once&rsquo; and it is supplied by Deussen who remarks &lsquo;88 a proof of his knowledge of brahman, (Vāmadeva) alleged his acquaintance with his former births as Manu and Sūrya&rsquo; (p. 317). The words can very well be construed as meaning that Vanadeva, having realized</p>

<p>brahman when he sang the hymn Rg. IV. 26, expressed his identity with Manu and Surya (and the whole universe ). There is no express reference to former births and Saṅkarācārya in 2555 his bhāsya on Bṛ. Up. understands the passage in this sense and does not refer to former births. It cannot be said that the Bṛ. Up. quotes Rg. IV. 26. 1 for supporting the concep tion of transmigration but it relies on it merely for the concep tion of identity of the individual soul with the Supreme Self.</p>
<p>Then there is a passage in the Ait, Up. which Deussen refers to (pp. 317–318 of Ph. Up.). In the 2nd adhyāya that Upanisad refers to the conception of a person as the first birth; when the child is actually born that is described as the 2nd birth. Then it proceeds &ldquo;He (the son) being the self of the father is placed in his (the father&rsquo;s ) stead for the performance of all sacred works; then his other self (the father) having performed all he has to do and having reached the span of his life (having become very old ) departs (from this world) and departing from this world is born again, that is his third birth. And this has been declared by a sage &lsquo;while dwelling in (mother&rsquo;s ) womb I came to know all the births of the gods; a hundred strongholds of ayas (copper or iron) held me, but I 98caped down with speed like a hawk, Vāmadova lying in his mother&rsquo;s womb declared this&rdquo;. In this passage the father and son are treated as identical, as elsewhere it is so said (vide note below). This Rgveda Verse (the 2nd half) is liable to several interpretations. In the Rgveda (I. 80, %, VIII. 95. 3, IX. 68. 6, X. 11. 4 &amp;c.) it is frequently stated that (syena) hawk brings Soma for Indra. Syena may also be interpreted as standing for the soul and the iron fortresses as the bodies through which the transmigrating soul wanders. The Rgveda sage might have only meant the mythical hawk of Indra. But as the word &lsquo;janimāni&rsquo; occurs in the first half the Upaniṣadio sage (in Ait. Up.) might have used the verge to support his ideas about the three births. But even in the Ait. Up. passage the three births are not clearly of one person, unless we resort to a myth, viz. the conception of a son and the son&rsquo;s birth are</p>

<p>taken as the two births of the father himself on the ground that the son is the father himself born again.2566</p>
<p>The Upaniṣads laid down an inexorable law that fruits of all actions, good or evil, must be experienced and that a person&rsquo;s deeds and conduct determined the character of his succeeding existences. But from gome passages in the Upaniṣads themselves it appears that they recognised some exceptions. One exception was that when a pesron realized that he was one with brahman the actions both good and evil, if any, done by him after that Realization and before the physical death of the body produced 20 results. In Chān. Up. VI. 14. 3 Satyakāma 2567 Jābāla tells his pupil Upakosala that&rsquo;Just as water does not cling to a lotus leaf, so no evil deed clings to one who knows (realizes) brahman&rsquo;; Chan. Up. V. 24. 3 &lsquo;just as the (soft) cottonlike fibres of the iṣikā reed when cast into fire are burnt out, so all evil deeds of him who knowing (the purport of) Vaiśvānara (brahma) offors Agnihotra are burnt&rsquo;. The Bṛ. Up, states &lsquo;Him who knows these two do not overwhelm, whether he says that he did evil for some reason or that he did a good deed for some reason; he overcomes both these; neither what he has done nor what he has omitted to do afflict (lit, heat or burn) him&rsquo;. The Mupdaka Up. provides &lsquo;when a person has seen (realized) the Highest (cause ) and lowest (effect) his actions perish.&rsquo; But this is only true as regards all acts before he attained Realization and all acts that his body may do after his attainment of Realization but he cannot rescind the prārabdha karma which brought about that existence wherein he reached Realization of brahman. The idea is that the actions which led to a person&rsquo;s present embodiment must all be consumed by the body persisting till the appointed period for its death, and then only he becomes free from the</p>

Up. states 256889 toaman who has attained true knowledge of the Supreme Self from a teacher that &lsquo;for him there is only delay so long as he is not delivered (from the body ), then he will become perfeot&rsquo;. All these Upanisad passages are relied upon in V. S. IV. 1. 13-15 and Saṅkaracarya explains their purpose concisely but very clearly. The Gitā also says (IV. 37) that the fire of knowledge reduces to ashes all deeds. Here all means only Sancita and Sañciyamāna and excludes prārabdha-karma. About the acts during the period between the attainment of Vidya and the fall of the body Saṅkarācārya gives the instance of an arrow shot from a bow, which stops only after the initial impetus is exhausted in the flight of the arrow. Some works say that when the meritorious deed or the sinful deed done in the present life is of the extremest kind it may yield results in this very life. 2569</p>
<p>The Upaniṣad theory is that one must bear the consequences of all actions, good or evil. But sometimes an evil action is done without any previous thought, as, for example, when a man&rsquo;s gun goes off by accident and somebody is killed or seriously injured. This led to a discussion in Dharmagūtras and Smṛtis and the doctrine of prāyasoittas (expiations) for sins was developed. From Vedic times some rites had been performed to counteract mishaps and irregularities in the course of religious Ceremonies and for portentous phenomena or personal misfortunes such as a dog-bite. In these the idea was</p>

<p>of ceremonial purity and the averting of evil results from such phenomena in which no question of sin as ordinarily understood entered. In the Gautama Dharmasūtra there is a discussion on this, which is probably the earliest clear exposition on expia tions for sins. Gautama states that there were two views on the efficacy of expiations against sins. One view was that expiations should not be performed as regards sins, because a sin is not destroyed unless its consequences are experienced ; the other view was that &lsquo;one should perform expiations since there are Vedic passages indicative of this, such as &lsquo;after performing the sacrifice called Pupaḥstoma one can come back ( i. e. become fit for) Soma sacrifice (i e. for all Vedic rites in general)'; &lsquo;after performing the Vrātyastoma&rsquo; (one becomes fit for vedic saorifices ), &lsquo;he who offers the Asvamedha sacrifice crosses beyond all sin, beyond (even) 2570 brāhmaṇa murder.&rsquo; Some held the view that only sins committed inadvertently were removed by expiations; 2571 while others held the view that expiations were efficacious even against sins committed wil fully as there are Vedic indications to that effect (Manu XI. 45). Manu, however, appears to have held that a man is relieved of the lapses inadvertently committed by means of the study of the Veda, but sins wilfully committed can be removed only by various prescribed expiations (XI. 46) and that a man must always resort to expiations for sins, since those who have not done so have to undergo a double retribution viz, the tortures of horrible hells for long terms of years and also being born in other human existences with bodily deformities and diseases (Manu XI 48 and XII, 54). The subject of expiations and of Karmavipāka (fruition of evil actions by being born as a worm or lower animal, or having a short life and premature death and undergoing torments of Hell) has been dealt with at length in H. of Dh. Vol. IV. pp. 1–178).</p>

For reasons of space it is not possible to set out this whole mass but a few illustrative pass. ages will be cited.</p>
<p>Manu states ( XII, 54-69, with which Yāj. 111. 206-208 and 212-215 agree in many places) &lsquo;those guilty of mortal sins (Mahāpātakas), having gone through terrible hells during a large numbers of years, come after the expiration (of hell punishment) to the following births. The slayer of a Brāhmaṇa passes through the births of dog, pig, ass, camel, cow (or ox ), goat, sheep, deer, a bird, a cīṇdāla and a pukkasa; a brābınapa who drinks the liquor called Surā enters the bodies of worms and (large ) insects, of moths (or locusts ), of birds feeding on ordure and of carnivorous animals; a brāhmaṇa ( who steals gold of a brāhmaṇa) shall pass a thousand times through the births of spiders, snakes, lizards, aquatic animals and of destructive gobling; the violator of his guru&rsquo;s bed passes &amp; hundred times through (the form of) grasses, shrubs, creepers, carnivorous animals and of beasts with fangs and of those (animals) like tigers doing cruel acts. Those men who are given to injuring others become animals that eat raw flesh, those who eat forbidden food become worms, those that thieve become creatures consum jag their own kind (such as fishes) and those who have inter course with women of the lowest classes become pretas (ghostly spirits); one who has associated with outcasts (for certain specified periods), he who approaches the wives of other men and he who has deprived a brāhmaṇa of his property (other than gold) becomes Brahmarakṣasa (an evil demon); a man who has on account of greed stolen gems, pearls or coral or any of the other kinds of precious stones is born among goldsmiths; for stealing grain a brāhmaṇa becomes a rat, for stealing bell-metal a man becomes a hamsa bird, for depriving another of water he becomes the bird called Plava, for stealing honey a stinging</p>
<p>Successive vile births for mortal sins</p>

<p>insect, for stealing milk a cow, for stealing sweet juice (sugar-Oane &amp;o) a dog, for stealing olarified butter an ichneumon; for stealing meat &amp; vulture, for stealing fat a cormorant, for stealing oil a bird called Tailapaka, for stealing salt a cricket, for stealing curds a bird called Balākā (crane); for stealing silk a partridge, for stealing linen a frog; for stealing cloth of cotton threads Kraunca bird, for stealing &amp; cow an iguana, for stealing molasses a bird called vāgguda (a bat?), for stealing fine perfume a musk-rat, for stealing vegetables consisting of leaves a peacock, for &lsquo;stealing cooked food of various kinds a porcupine and for stealing uncooked food a hedgehog; for stealing fire a person becomes a heron, for stealing household utensils a mason-wasp, for stealing dyed garments &amp; cakora bird; for stealing a deer or an elephant a wolf, for stealing a horse a tiger, for stealing fruits and roots a monkey, for stealing a woman a bear, for stealing drinking water a cūtaka, for stealing vehicles a camel, for stealing cattle a ho-goat; that man who has forcibly taken away any kind of property belonging to another or who eats sacrificial food of which no part has been offered in sacrifice certainly becomes &amp; lower animal; women also who in like manner committed theft shall incur guilt; they become the females of those same creatures ( enumerated above).</p>
<p>It may be noted that some of the births designed to those guilty of thefts of various articles have some logic or reason behind those regulations e. g. when Manu XII, 62 and Yāj. 11. 214 prescribe that a thief of grains becomes a rat in the next birth or when Manu XII. 61 prescribes that a thief of jewels, pearls and coral is born among the class of goldsmiths, one can easily appreciate this retribution as appropriate or reasonable, but the same cannot be said of all others. It is noteworthy that, in spite of what the bhāṣya on Y. S. quoted in note 2325 and pp. 1417-18 above says, a single mortal sin lika brahmana-murder might make the perpetrator pags through several vile births, ag stated by Manu in XII. 55-58, Yaj.

<p>quick pace was set even in early times for the removal or reduction of the effects of sins in other ways than by means of expiations. Gautama 2573 proscribes five means for redeeming (or expiating) blamable acts viz. inaudible recitation of the Veda, austerities, sacrifice in fire, fasting, giving gifts. The history of Dharmaśāstra vol. IV deals at some length with japu (pp. 44-51 ), tapas (pp. 42-43), homa (pp. 43-44), dana (pp. 51-52) • and fasting (pp. 52-51). Therefore, it is not necessary to say here anything about them. But attention must be drawn to some special and far-reaching modifications of these and other means. Sūdras and members of pratiloma castes were not authorized to study the Veda. Hence the authors of medieval works, particularly of Purāṇas,&rsquo; went so far as to say that remembrance 2574 of the name of Kșspa is superior to all expiations and all forms of austerities and that if a man only remembers Nārāyaṇa in the morning, noon, evening, at night and other timnes, he at once secures the destruction of (the consequences of) sins. Other means were also provided for the removal of sins, one being pilgrimage to holy places. Vide H. of Dh. vol. IV. pp. 55-56 and 552-580. Another was the practice of prāpāyāma which has been dealt with on p. 42 of H. Dh, vol. IV.</p>
<p>Even in the earliest times open confession of sin was in certain cases regarded as freeing the person from sin. In the Cāturmāsya called Varupa-pragbāsa, the wife who took part with her husband had to confess expressly or by some indirect ways whether she had at some time a paramour and if she did 80 she was purified and could take part in the sacrad rites there. after.

<p>Repentance (anutāpu). Manu (XII. 227 and 230 ) provides that a sinner is relieved of the consequences of sin by proolaim ing his sin to people, by repentance, by austerities, by recitation of Vedic texts, by gifts in case of distress (i. o. if he is unable to undergo tapas); a man after commiting a sin becomes free from</p>
<p>it by feeling remorse and if he makes a resolve &lsquo;I shall never again do so&rsquo; he is purified. The Viṣnupurāṇa provides that, when afer committing a sin the man feels remorse, the one high expiation that he has then to undergo is the remembrance of Hari 2576 MacNicol, a Scottish Missionary, wrote &amp; work (in 1915) on &lsquo;Indian theism&rsquo; in which he boldly asserts, after referring to the Upanisadic doctrine of Karma that there is no place for repentance in the Hindu doctrine of Karma&rsquo; (p. 223). It has been shown above that confession was known in Vedic times and that repentance was valued in Dharmaśāstra works either as removing sing or as making the repentant man fit for receiving expiatory rites (vide H. of Dh. VoL IV. pp. 41-42). The worthy missionary author probably thinks his Christian brand of remission of sins by confession and repentance better than the Upanisadic teaching. Ancient Indian authors were not prepared to accept mere confession and repentance as enough to absolve a man of all sing. The Biblical position that if one believes in Christ and his gospel, confesses his sins and says he repents (as required in Matthew 4. 17, Mark I. 15 and Luke 24. 47 ) is very likely to engender among common men a complacent attitude about sins. This complacent frame of mind, the ancient Dharmaśāstra writers wanted to prevent and therefore, they insisted upon a good deal more than repentance and confession of sins. They blended the old doctrine of con fession and repentance with retribution viz. hell tortures and vile births. Later Paurāṇik writers approached very close to the probable attitude of common Christians that one has simply to - believe in Christ as a redeemer, to confess and to take the name of God for being absolved from all sins. Macnicol either did not</p>

<p>Long before MacNicol wrote and since his days numerous Western scholars brought up in Christian Burroundings have expressed their view that the ancient Indian doctrine as regards man&rsquo;s destiny after death is far more preferable to Biblical ideas on the same subject. It is enough to refer to oply two or three authors, Arberry in his &ldquo;Asiatic Jones&rsquo; quotes (p. 37) from Sir William Jones&rsquo; letter to Earl Spencer the following passage &lsquo;I am no Hindu, but I hold the doctrine of the Hindus concerning a future state to be incomparably more rational, more pious and more likely to deter mon from vice, than the horrid opinions inculcated by Christians on punishments without end&rsquo;. Lowes Dickinson in &lsquo;Religion and Immortality&rsquo; (Dent and Sons, 1911) observes (on p. 74) &lsquo;it is really a consoling idea that our present capacities are determined by our previous actions and that our present actions again will determine our future character&rsquo;. Owen Rutter, author of the scales of Karma&rsquo; (London, 1925) says that Christianity has failed to solve the intellectual and moral problemas which beset those who live in the complexities of the modern world, that he began to study the doctrine of Karma and reincarnation seven years before he wrote the book, which is a personal statement rather than an essay on Karma (pp. 12–13). Many who have written against this doctrine, while conceding that the Upanisadic doctrine is an ancient and serious attempt to solve the problema of injustice and evil in the world, call it a weak one and beset with difficulties. One should like to ask, what systems of religion and philosophy are not beset with difficulties? One may take the Christian doctrines for example. To all non-Christians (and to soveral Christians also in modern times) ita doctrine of original gin, its damnation of unbaptized infants, of predestination deduced from the belief that God is an Omniscient and Omnipotent Creator of heaven and earth appear strange and unjustified. L. T. Hobhouse in &lsquo;Morals in Evolution&rsquo; part II (1906) pp. 130 ff points out how all systems with a personal God, particularly Christianity, are beset with difficulties, such as making the problem of evil urgent, eternal punishment for &amp; great sinner in one life suggestive of a moral impossibility, the inescapable conclusion that all men, however good, that did not or could not or do not believe in Christ and are not members of the Christian Church by baptism are irrevocably doomed. That</p>
<p>Prof. Toynbee on a christian dogma</p>
<p>1595</p>
<p>Christianity is unique and that Christians are God&rsquo;s chosen people are beliefs which would make God appear quite unjust and therefore some Christian writers like Prof. Toynbee in</p>
<p>Christianity among the religions of the world&rsquo; (Oxford Un, Press, 1958) have begun to urge that Christianity must be purged of such beliefs (pp. 13 and 95).</p>
<p>The strict doctrine of Karma would require that there can be no transfer of good or bad karma from one man to another and a man cannot suffer for the sins of others. But in the Rgveda there are allusions to the belief that God might inflict punish ment on the sons for the sins of their fathers. For example, in Rg. VII. 86. 5 Vasistha 2577 prays to Varupa &ldquo;cast awuy from us the transgressions of our fathers, and those that we committed in our own person&rsquo;; *May we not have to suffer for the sin committed by another, may we not do that for which you punish (this is addressed to Vißve-devāḥ). The Santiparva, however, asserts &lsquo;whatever deed a man does in four ways viz. with eye, with thought, speech or action, he receives (in return) that same kind of action; a man does not enjoy (i. e. experience the results of) the good deeds or evil deeds of another; man attains (a result) in consonance with the actions done by himself &lsquo;. 2578 Similarly, in the Gṭdhra-gomāyu-sarvāda, it is asserted &lsquo;the son does not have to go by the path due to the actions of the father, nor vice versa, they being bound by their own respective good or evil deeds proceed each by a different path&rsquo;. Whatever deed a man does, whether holy or very unholy (terrible), the consequences of that are experienced by the door alone, what have the relatives to do with that&rsquo; (Santiparva 153, 38 and 41=cr. ed. 149. 34 and 37).</p>

<p>varnas and asramas according to Śāstra and if they gwerve from their duties he should make them follow their duties, since he gets a share of the dharma (merit) observed by them. Manu provides (VIII. 304-305, 308) that the king who protects his subjects secures the sixth part of the (spiritual) merit of all (his subjects), but if he does not guard them he also shares in the sixth part of their adharma (sin); the king who protects well is entitled to the sixth part of the merit of the Veda study, the sacrifices, the gifts, and of the worship of gods done by all subjects ; that king who takes as his one-sixth part of the crops and other products, but fails to guard the subjects is declared (by sages) as receiving all the sins of all his subjects'. Manu says elsewhere (in IX. 301) that the king is the Yuga, that his actions may bring in Krta or any of the other Yugas. Kālidāsa in Sakuntala echoes this idea 2580 Manu (in VIII. 316) provides that when a thief comes to a king, confesses his guilt and asks the king to punish him with a heavy staff or a sharp weapon and the king either punishes him or lets him off, the thief is freed from (the effects of) the sin, but the king incurs the guilt of the thief if he does not punish him. To the same effect is Vasistha 19. 46 and 20. 41. It was stated by Manu (III, 100 ) that all the merit of even a man who lives a plain life by subsisting on grains left in the field after the crops are garnered and who performs homa in the five fires (to be kept by an householder) is taken away by a brāhmaṇa guest who stays unhonoured by him. Santiparya, Visṇu Dh. S. and several Parānas provide that 2581 when a guest, being disappointed (in getting food), turns away from the house of a person, the guest goes away taking all the merit of the person and transfers to him all his own misdeeds. This was probably not meant to be taken literally. It is only an arthavāda ( in the language of the Mimāmsā) and morely exhorts a householder to bonour a guest properly.

<p>verse 2592 : &lsquo;whatever good deeds you performed in hundreds of existencos, all that will go to that party whose defeat you will bring about by your falso evidence.&rsquo; The Mit. and Aparārke both say that this is meant only to frighten and quote a verge of Nārada (rpādāna 200) in support' he (the judge) should frighten them (from telling lies) by citing anoient dharma Sāstra texts, by rocounting the greatness of truth and by censur ing falsehood.') Manu (VIII. 90), however, makes the exhorta tion run as follows &lsquo;Whatever good deeds you performed from pour birth, the merit of all of them would go to dogs if you will depoze falsely&rsquo;. Manu XII. 81 says 2583 with whatever dis position of mind (either sūttvika or rūjasa or tāmasa ) a man dnes an act he reaps the fruits thereof (in a future life ) in a body endowed with the same character.'</p>

<p>As regards husband and wife, the Dharmaśāstra works say a good deal but all that is said should not be taken literally.

<p>husband, resides in the same world (heaven) as her husband, and is called a virtuous wife. A woman restrained in thought, word and deed, secures by such conduct (as is laid down for her) in this life highest renown and rosidence with her husband in the next world'. For byperbolical descriptions of the power of a chaste wife (patirratā) in the great epic and Purāṇas, vide H. of Dh. vol. II. pp. 567-568. A verse cited there may be repeated here just as a snake-charmer forcibly draws out from a hole &amp; snako, so a chaste wife snatches away her husband&rsquo;s life from the messengers of death and reaches heaven with her husband'. This is also an arthavāda but it probably reflected the popular ideas of those times.</p>

The offering of balls of rice to the spirits of the departed male ancestors was in vogue in the times of the Veda probably and even before the Vedas and the theory of Karma and Punar-janma arose later and as people were not prepared to give up the theory of śrāddhas, they kept both.</p>
<p>The popular idea of the last thought at one&rsquo;s death leading to a future birth appropriate to that thought in spite of a life of sin and iniquity is an interference with the working of the law of Karma and transmigration. This notion has been dealt with</p>

<p>Apart from the Upaniṣads (and commentaries thereon), the Vedāntasūtras (and the bhāgyas thereon) and the Bhagavad gitā, there are very few regular treatises on the doctrine of Karma and re-incarnation, One work comparatively early in date is the Vijñānadipikā of Padmapāda (said to be the same as the favourite pupil of the first Saṅkarācārya) in 71 vorges (edited with a commentary and Introduction by M. M. Dr. Umesha Mishra, Allahabad, 1940) which deal with the means of achieving mokṣa by realizing the identity of the individual self and the Supreme Self (they being like the reflection and its original) and by annihilating karma. Some of the important Verges in it have been adduced above in the notes. That work (verse 9) 2588 compares sanolyamāna-karma to grain standing in the field, sancita to grain stored in one&rsquo;s house and prārabdha. karma to food put in one&rsquo;s stomach. The food put in one&rsquo;s stomach is exhausted by its being digested which takes some time. Therefore, Karma of the sancita and sañolyamāna types is annihilated by correct knowledge, while prārabdha karma by undergoing its results for some time. It emphasizes that it is Vairāgya (extreme non-attachment to objects of sense) that leads to the rise of correct knowledge of Reality, to the elimina tion of vāsanās (unconsciously working impressions), to the annihilation of Karma and to cossation of rebirth.</p>
<p>Another work is the Janma-maranavicāra of Bhatta Vāmadeva (published in the Kashmir Series of Texts and Studios vol. 19, 1918 A. D.), It is a small work in 25 pages. 2589 It appears to belong to the Kashmir Saiva cult. It states that Siva has three Saktis, Cit-sakti (which is of the nature of light or consciousness ), Svātantrya (free will, independence) and</p>

<p>Anandaśakti (bliss). There are six kiñenkus (slioaths, covers) viz. Māyā, Kalā, Suddha-vidya, Rāga. Kāla and Niyantraṇā. On p. 15 it says that when the bodily machine is broken, consciousness, taking hold of prūnana (breathing), is carried to another body by the Ativāhika (subtle body ).2593 This latter body becomes like a vehicle between the body that lies dead and the next pbysical body. The work thon quotes from a Kośabbāsya three verses which support the theory of the antara bhavadeha (the intermediate body between the dead physical body and the future physical body) and also relies on Rg. X. 85. 16.2591 It also quotes Bhagavadgitā. 14. 14-15 (yadā sattve pravṛddhe tu &amp;c) and says that those bodily states are referred to in such Vedic passages as &lsquo;Pancare cakre &amp;c&rsquo;(Rg. X. 164. 13), in Kathopaniṣad 1.6 (sasyam-ira martyah pacyate), in &lsquo;Vāsiinsi jirpāni&rsquo; (Gita II. 22). He further says that by God&rsquo;s grace a man becomes pure and by dikṣit and other means he understands his real character and reaches Śiva. It states that all,nen do not attain liberation, while those who hate ( discard) likṣā, temples and correct knowledge go to hell. There is very little discussion about the kinds of Karma and the removal of the effects of these.</p>

<p>The author Acyutarāya states that the work really meang *Prārabdha-pada-dhyāntasamhrti' ( destruction of the darknees caused by the doctrine of prārabdha) and that all that he wants is to combat the false idea that all human acts from the moment of conception to death are governed by past deeds alone to the exclusion of everything else, He postulates that all human activity is due to prārabdha, to sainskāras (sub-conscious or latent impressions or tendencies) and prayatna (human effort). He explains : the moment after the body dies, all the accumulated good and bad deeds set in motion by God become ready to yield their retribution (results ) and that a good or evil deed (or both ) that is strongest begins a suitable body. The birth is that of a brahmapa or the rest when there is mixed good and evil as the strongest karma, as a lower animal when sin is strongest, &amp;s &amp; godly birth when a good dood is strongest. The duration of life may be 100 years, less or more, and bhoga means experiencing pleasure or pain that is regarded as favourable or unfavoura ble 259 Then he launches on the discussion of pleasure (sukha) as threefold, viz. illusory (pratibhasika), actual (vyāyahārika) of actual due to illusory pleasure. Pleasure is again ramya (beautiful) and priya ( dear or liked). These two are not syno nymous, since gold would appear beautiful to an ascetic but it is not dear to him. Then he divides what is priya into three kinds (or degrees). He divides each of the three kinds of pleasure into three varieties, which are passed over here. The preceding are classifications of pleasure that is &lsquo;Laukikakārya&rsquo; (ordinary or common); but there are also other sukhas, viz. vaidika (fourfold such as pratikopāsanā, ahārya (assumed) and vāsanātmaka</p>

Pain (duhkha) is divisible in the same way as sukha and the author illustrates the different kinds of pain, that are left out here. Then the author dilates upon the cause or causes of pleasure and pain (sukha and duḥkha) that constitute man&rsquo;s experience on earth, which causes are prārabdha (past karma that has begun to operate and determines the body the soul secures), sanskara and prayatna. 2593 He states that the bliss that a man feels in meditation (samadhi) is due to prārabdha, the pleasure he feels in deep sleep is due to sarskāras 2594 and the pleasure on the fall of rain after the performance of the Kārlrt (sacrifice) is due to human effort From the Upanisad passager it follows (says Acyutarāya) that in deep sleep there is no desire, nokarma and no fear and so the pleasure (expressed on waking in the .words &lsquo;sukham ahamasvapsam&rsquo; (I had a happy sleep) is not due to prārabdha but to samakāras. He relies on the Br. Up. 2595 (IV. 4.2) for holding this view (i.e. he taken *pūryaprajñā' in that paggage as equal to vāsanā (latent impres Bions or reminiscences of past experiences).

<p>manda (inferior), tiyra (formidable). A good deed which is three parts sāttvike and one part rājaga is called madhya; a deed which is half sāttvika and half rājasa is tivta. Then Acyutarāya refers to a conflict of views. Following the words &lsquo;punyo vai puṇyena karmaṇā bhavati pāpaḥ pāpena&rsquo; (Bṛ. Up. III. 3. 13 quoted in note 2510 above), some writers held that it is only Karma that is the cause of a new birth and that vidya (knowledge of all kinds) and pūrvaprajñā have nothing to do with it, while others relying on Br. Up. IV.4.2 (to which refør ence is made in the Saṅksepaśāriraka&rsquo;III, 18) held that Vidya, Karma and Puryaprajñā have all to do with the assumption of a new body by the soul. Achyutarāya agrees with this latter view. He divides and subdivides Karma, vidyā and pūrva. prajñā, so that ultimately the threefold apparatus for giving a new body comes to 96 varieties and remarks that these divisions are not of much use. 259 To the objection that all this refutation of prārabdhavada is idle and serves no purpose he replies: men are of three sorts, mukta (liberated), mumuksu (desirous of liberation) and viṣayin (immersed in enjoying the objects of sense). As regards the first the Chan. Up. VI, 14. % says &lsquo;for him there is delay so long as he is not delivered (from the body), then he will be perfect,2598 The game is relied upon in V. S. IV. 1. 19. The idea being that until prārabdhakarma that brought about the body in which Realisation was attained is done away with by the death of the body, the self is jivanmukta, but his other karma that has not begun to yield fruit is done away with by Realisation, To the same effect is Bhagavadgita.</p>

<p>The present author has read either wholly or partially the following modern works, mostly written by Western scholars on Karma and rebirth, that either offer remarks for or against that dootrine. The space at the author&rsquo;s disposal precludes any detailed statement about the objections raised against this doctrine in some of them. But a few important objections will be stated and will be briefly dealt with. The works read or consulted are: &ldquo;Philosophy of the Upanishads&rdquo; by Paul Deussen, translated by A. S. Geden (1906) pp. 313-338; J. R. A.S. for 1906 pp. 586-593 and for 1907 pp. 665–72 on modifications of the doctrine of Karma by E. W. Hopkins; Transmigration of souls' by Alfred Berthelot, translated by H. J. Chaytor (Harper, London, 1909);' Karma and redemption' by A. G. Hogg (od. of 1910); Religion and immortality by G. Lowes Dickinson (Dent, 1911); &lsquo;Re-incarnation&rsquo; by E.D. Walker (Rider and Co., London, 1913); this book contains extracts from Western authors (22 in number) on re-incarnation (pp. 63–124); there is also a long chapter (pp. 127-191) of extracts from Western Poetry on the same subject; he also deals with evidences of the doctrine in the Bible and early Christendom and a Bibliography on pp. 329-343; * Fate and free will' by Ardesar Sorabji N. Wadia (Dent and Sons, London 1915). He states the problem to be whether fate by itself influences and directs the course of human evolu tion of freewill by itself or both fate and freewill working conjointly lay down the lines along which human progress must lie'. He states that it must be the one or the other and that it can never be both (p. 180). He himself believes in a fixed and determinist future; &lsquo;Immortality&rsquo;eggays on, by B.H. Stroeter and others (Macmillan &amp; Co. 1917); pp. 293-317 deal with re-incarna tion and Karma by Miss Lily Dougall and pp. 317-341 deal with modern Theosophy which adopts the doctrines of re-incarnation and Karma ; &lsquo;Religion and philosophy of the Veda and Upew nishads&rsquo; by A.

Bhattacharya in Malaviya Commemoration Volume (1932) pp. 491–526; &lsquo;Reincarnation for every man&rsquo; by Shaw Desmond (Rider &amp; Co. London). This work mentions in chap. VIII European great men that believed in this doctrine; &lsquo;The goales of karma&rsquo; by Owen Rutter (London). This book contains numerous references to Greek and Roman writers and to modern English and German poets and philosophors from whose works extracts are oited for showing that they believed in Karma and reincarnation such as Shakespeare, Hume, Goethe, Wordsworth ; &lsquo;Indian Philosophy by Dr.8. Radhakrishnan (1941) pp. 244-249; The circle of life&rsquo; by Kenneth Walker (Jonathan Cape, London, 1942) chap. VIII and IX pp. 81-104; &lsquo;Karma and re-birth&rdquo; by Christmas Humphreys (London, 1944); in chap. VII. pp. 62-66 he tries to show that Schopenhauer, Tennyson, Browning, Rossetti and John Masefield, the English Poet Laureate, believe in this doctrine; The problem of re-birth&rsquo; by Sri Aurobindo (Pondicherry, 1952);</p>
<p>•The Brahmasūtras' by Dr. 8. Radhakrishnan (1959), pp. 194–207 of the Introduction; &ldquo;The dogma of re-incarnation' by J. E, Sanjana (New Book Co., Bombay, 1954) pp. 1-134 with an Appendix on the rationale of the dogma of rebirth, pp. 137– 157. This is one of the largest and latest works on &rsquo;re-incarna tion' that the present author read. Mr. Sanjana writes bitterly and sometimes in offensive language about those from whom he differs. He asserts that he is a true Zoroastrian and that it can be said without any exaggeration and with the most porfect reason and justice that a man who believes in re-incarnation is not a true Zoroastrian' (p. 125). None Deed quarrel with his first belief, but the latter part of the sentence invites serious consideration. He appears to aver that he has &amp; monopoly of the true doctrines of Zoroastrianism and like the Roman Church and the Popes, that held that the true religion was only in their keeping and that all others (even those who believed in the Bible and Christ) were damned, holds that Zoroastrians believing in ro-incarnation are apostates. I shall cite only one or two Parsi scholars who hold just the opposite view. Mr. R. F. Gorvala contributed &amp; paper on the &ldquo;Immortal Soul, its pre-existence,</p>

<p>persistence after death and transmigration&rdquo; to the Spiegel Oom memoration Volume edited by no less &amp; Parsi scholar than Dr. J. J. Modi (Bombay, 1908) pp. 99-124, in which he states (p. 124) &lsquo;that the Hindu doctrine of the transmigration of the soul influenced the faith of the ancient Zoroastrians in all times. Indeed the struggle between Good and Evil could not end in the triumph of the former if but one brief life was the only time given for the fight.&rsquo; Vide algo &lsquo;Philosophy of Zoroastrianism by Farodun K, Dadachanji (Bombay, Times of India Press, 1941) pp. 108–133, particularly pp. 116 ff. Mr. Sanjana seems to have been much upset by the faot that some Parsis, wbo were scholars of Avesta and Sanskrit, became Theosophists and admirers of Mrs. Besant and other famous personages in the Theosophist movement. Nearly half the main book of 129 pages is con cerned with the criticisms (sometimes extremely offensive ) of the doings and writings of Madame Blavatsky (pp. 28-42), Mrs. Besant (pp. 43–51), C. W. Leadbeater (pp. 57-59), A. P. Sinnett and others (like Col. Olcott and Mr. K. A. K, Iyer, author of</p>
<p>Vedanta), W.Q. Judge and a Gujarati book of an unnamed scholar (pp. 59–73). On pp. 82-88 he deals with MoTaggart, G, L, Dickinson and W. Lutogowski (Polish writer who claims that he remembers his many past lives). Mr. Sanjana returns (pp. 89–103) to the charge against the Theosophists and the storms aud sruptions in the Theosophical society and considera some works on Sufism alao (pp. 106-115). He emphasises the good points of Zoroastrianism as certified by W. B. Henning, J. W. Waterhouse and Hopkins. He does not devote much thought to the objections, more or less insuperable, against all monotheistic religions with a personal God in such works as Hobhouse&rsquo;s &lsquo;Morals in Evolution&rsquo; part 2, though in the appendix (on p. 140) he has to admit that no satisfaotory answer oan be given to the question why an omnipotent and omniscient God should allow Evil to exist. He contrasts Zoroaster&rsquo;s religion and philosophy with Hinduiem and Buddhism and winds up with an article by Winternitz (pp. 119-121) and then ends on an illuminating personal note in which he confesses (p. 126) that he in his youth was particularly attracted by the doctrine of re-incarnation eloquently propounded by Mrs. Begant, but later he became sceptical about what was said by Mrs. Besant Neophytes generally indulge in opprobrious language for the cult once ardently professed by them and later abjured and Mr. Banjana seems to be no exception to this. I may mention here only one or two instances of his language against Theosophista;</p>
<p>o The Roll-115 dina by</p>
<p>Mr. Sanjana&rsquo;s language about Theosophists</p>
<p>1607</p>
<p>on p. 64 he speaks of Blavatsky, Mrg. Besant, Sinnett and Leadbeater as &ldquo;proved charlatans&rdquo; and on p. 95 he writes about Mrs. Besant&rsquo;s entry into Politios as &ldquo;those later metamorphoses of the megalomaniac Mrs. Besant&rdquo;. It appears to the present writer that his study of original Sanskrit works is not deep and that he commits serious mistakes in the small portion of his work that he devotes to the ancient Indian view of the doctrine of re-incarnation. His wrong interpretation of Manu VI. 63 (p. 10 of his book) has been pointed out (on p. 1565). Some more cases of mistakes may be cited here. On p. 11 of his book he relies on Thibaut for the statement that there is nothing in the sūtras (the Vedānta-būtras) to warrant the main doctrine of Saṅkara about two Vidyas, the higher (parā) and the lower (aparā), which respectively lead to the higher (para ) brahma and the lower (apara ) brahme. If he had carefully read only a few of the eleven principal Upaniṣads (the Iśāvāsya, Kena, Katha, Mundaka, Praśna) he would have found for himself that Thibaut is not a trustworthy guide in all cases. The Mundaka Upaniṣad (I. 1. 4-5) speaks of two vidyās, para and aparā dve vidye veditavyo para oa, aparā ca, atha parā yayā tadakṣaram adhigamyate&rsquo; and this Mundaka text is treated as the basis of Vedāntagūtra 1. 2. 21-23 by Saṅkara and Rāmānuja. The Praśna Upaniṣad % states both para and apara brahma &lsquo;etadvai Satyakāma param cāparama 0a brahma yad-omkāraḥ&rdquo;. On pp. 21, 121, 146 he alleges that the words &ldquo;yadaharava virajet tadabarova pravzajet” (a man should become a sapnyasin the very day on which he feels disgust for this worldly life) are a dictum or saying of Saṅkara. But this text is taken from the Jābālopanigad 4. The whole passage of the Jābālopaniṣad 4 on the asramas is quoted by Saökara on Vedāntasūtra III. 4.20 and Saṅkara calls it Jabalasruti, On p. 22 Mr. Sanjana quotes Bhaga vadgita (IX. 32, &lsquo;mām hi pārtha vyapāṣritya yepi syu) pāps yodayaḥ, striyo vaiśyās-tatha sudrās-tepi yānti parām gatim) and holds that women, Taisyas and sūdras are declared to be included under &ldquo;pāpayonaya' (of evil or ginful birth). This is quite wrong. A Vaibya from very ancient times belonged to the three higher classes and in the Chandogya Upaniṣad V. 10.7, it is expressly stated that Vaiśyayoni is of good birth ( those whose conduct has been good will quiokly attain some good birth, the birth of a brāhmaṇa or of a kṣatriya or of a vaisya, but those whose conduct has been evil will attain an evil birth, the birth of a dog or a hog or a cindala&rsquo;. So vaisya&rsquo;s was good</p>

<p>birth in Chān. Upanisad. Women of the higher classes could not study the Veda in medieval times but women of the three Nigher classes co-operated with their husbands in all religious rites (including Vedic sacrifices). Therefore, the Gitā first mentions the worst case viz. that of Cāṇdālas and affirms that even Cāṇdālas (who belonged to the lowest class ) would attain the highest goal if they surrendered themselves as devotees to God and then adds three more classes of people viz. women, vaisyas and sūdras. A Sūdra was never among untouchables ; on the contrary, early Smrlis like Manu VI. 253, Yājñavalkya I. 166, Parāśara XI. 19 provide that a brāhmaṇa could take food at the house of a śūdra provided the latter was born of his slave woman or cultivated the brāhmaṇa&rsquo;s fields on the ront of half share of crops or was the friend of his family or tended his cattle or was his barber. In medieval times (after the 5th or 6th century AD.), however, the caste system became more rigid but even up to the 12th century A.D. a brāhmaṇa could take food at a śūdra&rsquo;s house in extreme calamity (vide History of Dharma gastra, vol. 111. pp. 952-53). Thereafter this was forbidden and was included among Kalivarjya acts. The vaisyas are probably equated with women and sūdras because in their pursuit of wealth they never cared to study the Veda and Upaniṣads. Other passages of Mr. Sanjana&rsquo;s work are not cited for criticism for reasons of space.</p>
<p>Some of the objections raised by Western thinkers and writers against the doctrine of Karma and re-incarnation will now be mentioned and briefly dealt with. One or two prelimin ary matters have to be emphasized. Many in the West regard our life after the death of the bodies as certain, but bardly any. one of them regards our life before our present bodies as a pos sibility. The explanation of this attitude of many Western thinkorg lies in the fact that in modern Western thought the great support of the belief in immortality of the soul has been the Christian religion, which is supposed not to recognize the pre-existence of the soul. Besides, Christian writers from Augustine onwards firmly believed that religious truths outside the revelation in the Bible as interpreted by them were a work of the devil. MoTaggart in &lsquo;Some Dogmas of religion&rsquo;(London, 1930) attacks this attitude. He holds (p. 113 ) that any evidence which will prove immortality will also prove pre-existence and that there is nothing in pre-existence that is inoompatible with any of the dogmas that are generally accepted as fundamentalObjections against doctrine of Karma</p>
<p>1609</p>
<p>to Christianity. L. P. Jacks in Near the brink&rsquo; (Allen and Unwin, London, 1952, pp. 10-11) holds the same opinion ( at the age of 92 ) as MoTaggart&rsquo;s. Wordsworth in his famous Ode appears to agree that the present life is preceded by another existence when he says &lsquo;Our birth is but a sleep and a forgetting, the soul that rises with us, our life&rsquo;s star, had elsewhere its setting and cometh from afar.&rsquo; L. P. Jacks in the work men tioned above remarks (on p. 9) that an endless punishment is not, strictly speaking, &amp; punishment at all but an exercise of cruelty or vengeance and that the same is true of an endless reward.</p>
<p>The first objection raised against the doctrine of Karma by Pringle-Pattison in &lsquo;Idea of immortality&rsquo; (Oxford, 1922) is that absence of memory of the pre-existence is fatal to it (p. 11%) and that immortality without recollection is quite useless. Miss Lily Dougall in &lsquo;Immortality&rsquo; by Canon Streeter and others raizes a similar objection (p. 29). This objection can be answered in various ways. Does any one remember anything of what one did during the first two years of his life? It is also well-known that mon do not correctly remember in old age even the names of their grand-children nor does a man remember what he did exactly ten years ago during his present life. It is rather merciful that there is no momory of past lives. If all the multifarious memories of many lives were to crowd on us in the present life, our minds would be confused and matters in the progent life would be very much complicated. Karma is a cosmio law like the law of gravitation. The latter was not recognized by humanity for thousands of years but all the same it existed and worked. Several people claim to remember their past lives. The story of Santidevi was published as a case of re-incarnation by Lala Deshbhandhu Gupta, Pandit Nekiram Sharma, and Tarachand Mathur. The &lsquo;Theosophist Monthly&rsquo; for January 1925 mentions concrete instances of the memory of past lives. The lives of Aloyone' (Adgar, 1924) is a work in two volumes by Mrs. Begant and Mr. Leadbeater in which 48 lives are traced from 70000 B. C. to 624 A. D. with photographs of some of them as they must have appeared in the respective incarnations. The present author does not go into that question here. In the Essays on Immortality edited by B. H. Streeter it is said (on p. 297 ) that lack of conscious continuity between two incarnations of a soul negatives the doctrine. One may ask: what grounds are there to hold or to prove that the reprobate oriminal who will be awarded a judgment of eternal punish</p>
<p>\#. D. 202</p>
<p>1610</p>
<p>(880. IX, Oh. XXXV</p>
<p>ment will remember while undergoing hell fires his past lifo on earth? If one can believe in future eternal punishment for a confirmed sinner without any tangible evidence of memory of the sinful life he lived, why refuse to believe in pre-existence merely on the ground of absence of memory? Vide &lsquo;Some Dogmas do.&rsquo; p. 130. Further, science holds that matter and energy are indestructible, they are only transformed into other forms. Why should one regard it as absurd if one were to hold that the soul (to which post-existence is granted by Christianity and some other religions) should be held to come into existence in the present life all at once and not be held to have had previous existence but only in a different form? The continuity of the soul in past and future existences ia merely a metapbysical question and cannot be affected by the loss of memory. The latter occurs in one life of many years as to numerous happenings and at least in that one life the soul is admittedly one throughout.</p>
<p>Another objection is on the ground of heredity. We often find a strong likeness between parents and children in body and sometimes in mental faculties also. How are we to explain this? One answer may be that by some law not yet discovered the soul that has to undergo rebirth is born to parents suited to his condition. Besides, children are not exactly like their parents, some resemble in several physical features the mother or the father, but not in all and children of the same parents differ among themselves even as regards physical features. As regards mental qualities, children do not very often resemble their parents. What sort of mental equipment was possessed by the parents of such men of genius as Shakespeare, Newton, Ramapujan, Einstein ? Karma does not express what a man inherits from his ancestors, but it expresses that which he inherits from himself in some previous state or states of existence.</p>
<p>Another objection is often raised that belief in the doctrine of Karma would make men callous to buman misery and suffering and unwilling to belp. This also is a perverse idea. From the ancient Vedic times charity and compassion have been inculcated as the duties of all men without distinction. The Rgveda (X. 117.6) sage declares that man who cooks food for himself and eats it himself alone simply incurs sin' (kevalagho bhavati kovaladı). The Bf. Up. V. 2. 3 prescribes for all mon the three duties viz, self-restraint, charity and compassion. I</p>

<p>1611</p>
<p>4 man having the means to help another does not offer help he would be failing in his duty. It is possible that the result of the sufferer&rsquo;s Karma might have been meant to be mitigated by the kindness of helpers.</p>
<p>Another objection is sometimes raised as follows. The population of the earth is growing rapidly. The question is: where do the additional egoes come from (vide Berthelot&rsquo;s work, English tr. p. 127 and J. E. Sanjana&rsquo;s book on the &lsquo;Dogma of Te-incarnation&rsquo; p. 81). Several answers are possible. Several species of lower animals have become extinot and the number of wild animals such as the lion is rapidly being reduced. It is possible for one who believes in Karma doctrine to argue that the selves that were masquerading as beasts now appear as human beings, because thetr Karma that reduced them to the state of beasts has been exhausted.</p>
<p>Some of the Purāñas declare that a man who is very sinful may reach lower and lower states e. g. the Vayupurāṇa 2599 (obap. 14 verses 34-37) provides that a very sipful man may become paśu (Cattle or a beast), then deer, then a bird, then &amp; creeping insect and then a tree or other immobile object. Theosophists and some modern scholars hold that once the human state is reached there is no regression at all. It may be noted that the Kathopaniṣad expressly states (in V. 6-7) that after the death of the body the souls take up birth in other bodies, while some become tree-trunks according to their actions and knowledge, The Oh, Up. V. 10, 7 days &lsquo;those whose conduct has been evil will quiokly attain an evil birth, the birth of a dog or hog or candāla.&rsquo; Manu (XII. 9) avers that a man is reduced by bodily sins to the stage of a treo-trunk, by sins due to speech to being a bird or a boast and by mental sins to lowest births (of a cāṇdāla eto.). In verges 62-68 of chapter XII, Manu describes the different births of various animals by the con mission of thefts of various articles and in verses 52-59 the births due to the grave sins of brahmana-murder, drinking liquor, in oost.

<p>Fundamental and leading characteristics of Hindu</p>
<p>culture and civilization</p>
<p>It is necessary to gather together the threads scattered over six thousand pages of the History of Dharmaśāstra and to emphasize the fundamental and leading characteristics and conceptions of Hindu culture and civilization.</p>
<p>The word Hindu ( in the form &lsquo;Hidu&rsquo;) appears to have been applied by the Persian2600 Emperors Darius ( 522-486 B.O.) and Xerxes ( 486-465 B. O.) to the territory and people to the west and to the east of the great river Sindhu, while the Greeks referred to the people in the same region as Indoi', from whioh comes the word &lsquo;Indian&rsquo;. Herodotus in his History (Loeb series) states that the Thracians were the biggest nation in the world next to the Indians (Book 5 para 3, vol. III p.5) and that the Indians constituted the 20th province of the Persian Empire and paid 360 talents of gold dust as tribute. The word. Sindhu' occurs more than two hundred times in the Rgveda alone in the singular as well as in the plural The words &lsquo;Sindbavah&rsquo; and * Sapta Sindhūn' occur more frequently than Sindhu in the singular. Indra is often desoribed as having let loose the seven Sindhus for flowing (Rg. I. 32.1%, II. 12.1%, IV. 28.1, VIL, 96.1, X, 43.3). In such passages what is meant is the great river Sindhu and its tributarios (or possibly its seven mouths ).</p>

<p>Many passages of the Rgveda where the singular is employed refer to the river Bindhu alone (as in Rg. IL, 15.6, IV. 30.12, V. 4.9 &amp;c). Io Rg. II, 15.6 it is said that Indra made Sindhu flow northwards. This would obviously refer to the first part of the river flowing northward from the Himalayas. Pāṇini usos the word Sindhu&rsquo; as the name of a country in IV. 3.93 (Saindhava&rsquo; means one who or whose ancestors lived in the Sindbu country). For the fluctuating limits of Aryāvarta, vide H. of Dh. Vol. II pp. 11-16 and p. 1525, note 2483 above, where Rg. passages about Bharatas are set out and it is shown that the Purāpas speak of Bharata-varsa as of the same extent</p>
<p>as that of modern India and the name is said to have been due ito Bharata, son of Duṣyanta and Sakuntala, Bharatavarṣa ocours</p>
<p>in the Hathigumpha Inscription of Kbāravela ( line 10 on p. 79) which cannot be assigned to a date later than the 1st century2601 B. C. It has been shown above (p. 1016 n. 1649 ) that Asoka in one of his adiota refers to his kingdom as Jambudvipa. Even in those days in the rather long sankalpa ( declaration) at the beginning of &amp; religious act in Mahārāṣtra, occur the words &ldquo;Jambudvipe Bharatavarse Bauddhāvatāre Godāvaryā dakṣiṇa tire' &amp;o. Therefore, the proper word to be used by us for our country should be Bharata varsa. It may be said that our culture and.civilization had throughout the past ages a geographical background. The Constitution of India has recognized this in its very first Article which runs India, that is Bharat, shall be &amp; union of States'. In view of the fact, however, that the words * Hindu' and' Indian' have been employed for centuries by foreign as well as our own writers, this work will employ those words instead of ' Bharatavarga'.</p>
<p>The words &lsquo;culture&rsquo; and civilization' are used as syno nyms by some writers, while some others regard them as quite distinguishable. These two are defined in various ways by scholars. A few definitions are set out here by way of sample,</p>
<p>Dr. Tyler states (in ‘Primitive Culture' vol. I p, 1, Murray, London, 1871) &lsquo;Culture or civilization is that complex whole which includes knowledge, belief, art, morals, law, custom and</p>

<li>Vide E, I, vol. XX pp. 71-89, Scholars differ about the data of this Inscription, Jayaswal holding (ibid, p. 77 ) that it belongs to the first half of the 2nd centary B, C., while N, N, Ghosh in J. G. J. R. I, vol. VI pp. 97-106 opines that it belongs to the last quarter of the first century B, C,</li>

<p>Definitions af</p>
<p>culture and</p>
<p>civilization&rsquo;</p>
<p>1615</p>
<p>any other capabilities and habits acquired by man is a member of society', Mattbew Arnold&rsquo;s definition of culture in his lengthy essay on Culture and Anarchy' (1869, Prefaco p. VIII) is rather restricted in scope. Ele regards culture as a &lsquo;pursuit of our total perfection by means of getting to know, on all the matters which concern us, the best which has been thought and said in the world, and through this knowledge turning a stream of fresh and free thought upon our stook notions and habits which we know follow ataunchly but mechanically, vainly imagining that there is &amp; virtue in following them staunchly whioh makes up for the mischief of following them mechanically, Prof. P. A. Sorokin in Social and Cultural Dynamics&rsquo; (1957, p.2) defines human culture as &lsquo;the sum total of everything which is created or modified by the conscious or unconscious activity of two or more individuals interacting with one another or condi tioning one another&rsquo;s behaviour.2612 Prof. Edgerton in Journal of American Oriental Society in a paper on the Dominant ideas in the formation of Indian Culture&rsquo; (vol, 62 for 194% pp. 151–156) understands culture as a total way of life viewed as &amp; Dorm and as such approved or at least tolerated by a people as a whole and by its articulate representatives generally.</p>
<p>Prof. Toynbee in &lsquo;Cirilizations on trial&rsquo; (1948) states (p. 223) &lsquo;I mean by a civilization the smallest unit of historical study at which one arrives when one tries to understand the history of his own country, U.S.A., gay, or U.K.&rsquo; Prof. Toynbee in his latest work ' Reconsiderations' (vol. XII pp. 76–77, of his Study of History) adopts Bagbey&rsquo;s definition of culture as meaning regularities in the behaviour, internal and external,</p>
<ol start="2602">
<li>Prof. Sorokio (ibid. pp. 24–25) distinguishes two types of integrated cultures, one called ideational and the other seasate. None of the two has, according to bim, ezisted in the porest form. In some culturas the first type prevails, in others the 2nd; while jo atill others both might miogle in equal proportions and on equal basis. This last he terms</li>
</ol>
<p>• idealistic type' (which is not to be confused with the ideational type ). Dr. G. S. Gburge&rsquo;s &lsquo;Culture and Society&rsquo; (Upiversity of Bombay Publi. cations, 1947) is a very useful book on culture and civilization and con siders at longth the views of eminent writers like Emerson, Arnold, Morley, Whitehead, Russell, Laski, Wells and others. Prof. Northrop in &lsquo;Meeting of East and West&rsquo; (1946) and Prof. Sorokin in Social Philosophies in ag age of crisis' (London, 1952 ) p. 145 hold that the total culture of a bation in the East or West is not a mora beap of numerons phenomong unrelatied to each otber but rather as grounded in differing philosophical conceptions of the nature of man and of the universe,</p>

<p>of the members of a Society, excluding those regularities which are clearly hereditary in origin' and adds that religious practices and institutions and, by implication, algo religious beliefs and experiences are certainly a part of oulture as thus defined' and mentions religion together with art, technology, social structure as examples of the elements of which culture consists ( pp. 84, 95). Prof. Toynbee further says that in his volumes he employed the word &lsquo;culture&rsquo; in two different senses, viz. (1) the comprehensive one in which it is used by Bagby and (2) in an exclusive sense in which the word has been current in contemporary English since the time of Matthew Arnold ( ibidi. p. 272). As regards the word &ldquo;civilization' be remarks (p. 273 ) that civilization is a hybrid word of modern French coinage and Johnson refused to include it in his dictionary.</p>
<p>Archibald Robertson (in Rationalism in theory and practice', London, 1954 p. 62 ) says &ldquo;when we use the word civilization', we mean &amp; society with enough command over nature to raise it above savagery or barbarism. Civilization prima rily means&rsquo;civitas&rsquo;city life, division of labour and consequent surplus production over and above were animal needs.' Vide Prof. 8. Levi&rsquo;s book &lsquo;L&rsquo;Inde et le Monde&rsquo;p 63 translated in H. Kraemer&rsquo;s&rsquo; World cultures and world religions'( London 1960 ) p. 315 where it is really a definition of Hindu civilization alone.</p>
<p>It is unnecessary to cite further definitions. We may accept any one of these for a working hypothesis. If a distinction is to be made between the two words, one may say that the word &lsquo;culture&rsquo;, being neutral in meaning, is the better one to use than the word &lsquo;civilization&rsquo;. The latter word is often employed for an advanced stage of social development and is contrasted with the stage of primitive or barbarian societies. People often speak of primitive culture, but rarely, if at all, of primitive civilization,</p>
<p>During the last 6000 years of human history, several cultures and civilizations rose and fell. Spengler, a militarist and anti-rationalistio author, who does not rely on religion, morality or politics but is a votary of force, examines about thirty civilizations and cultures and propounds the thesis that all of them (except seven or eight) follow &amp; certain common pattern, viz. they are born, grow, decline and die and that once defunct they are not revived. Prof. Toynbee, a Christian ( and</p>
<p>Toynbee on Indian culture criticized</p>
<p>1617</p>
<p>not a militarist) in his &lsquo;Study of History&rsquo; appears to arrive at conclusions not unlike those of Spengler, viz, culture and societies have stages of childhood, maturity, senility and disintegration. On p. 758 of Volume IX of his &lsquo;Study of History&rsquo; he gives a table for nineteen civilizations with the dates of their Epiphany (manifestation), of their breakdown and the span of growth phasa in number of years. He puts down Indic civilization as starting in 1375 B.C. and as breaking down in 725 B. C. and Hindu civilization as beginning in 775 A. D. and its breakdown in 1175 A. D. This is, to say the least, most objectionable.2603 The distinction between Indic and Hindu civilization is arbitrary and the dates also are so. Why the Hindu civilization is held by him as breaking down in 1175 A. D. is quite unconvincing and what was the nature or name of India&rsquo;s civilization between 725 B. O. and 775 A. D. is not stated by him. On the other hand, the whole metaphor of being born, growing, maturing and disintegrating is held inapplicable to civilizations by other distinguished writers, such as J. G. De Beus in the &lsquo;Future of the Wast&rsquo; (London, 1953), who remarks that civilizations are not born and they do not die (p. 60 ), but are transformed or absorbed. Prof. Sorokin asserts (in &lsquo;Social and Cultural Dynamica&rdquo;) that his theory has little in common with the age-old theories of the life cycle of culture and societies with stages of childhood, maturity, senility and decay (p. 627). Leonard Woolf in</p>
<p>Quack, quack&rsquo; mercilessly critioizes Spengler&rsquo;s theories (pp. 139-160). A. L. Kroeber in Style and Civilizations' (New York, 1957 ) agrees with Prof. Sorokid and disagrees with Spengler and Toynbee and remarks that &lsquo;the study of civili zations oan hardly become truly scientific or scholarly until it divests itself of emotional concern about crisis, decay, collapse, extinotion and doom&rsquo; (p. 160).</p>
<p>Among the numerous civilizations and cultures that flourished in the world there are only two (namely, the Indian and the Chinese ) that have survived and kept up a continuity of tradition for four thousand years (if not more ) in spite of recurrent invasions by foreign hordes like those by Persians,</p>
<p>2603, While these pages were passing through the press, I received Prof. Toynbee&rsquo;s Reconsiderations' (Vol. XII of bis Study of History ) on p. 184 of which be revises his opinion by saying &quot; the maintenance of the brahmans' monopoly of the religious ministry gires Indian History a continuity throughout the period ranging from the Aryan javasion to the impact of the West&rdquo;,</p>

Not only so, India could spread its literature, religion, art and culture, not by invasions or annexations but mostly by peaceful means, viz. teaching, translations of Sanskrit works and persuasion, to Ceylon, Burma, Sumatra, Malaya, Java, Bali, Borneo, China, Tibet, Japan, Mongolia and Corea.26*5 The charming island of Bali is still Hindu with four varnas, priests being called Pedanda (Pandita), consecrated water for worship being called Toya (vide S. Levi&rsquo;s &lsquo;Sanskrit texts from Bali&rsquo; Preface p. XII G.O.S.), priests still repeating one quarter of Gāyatri, viz. &lsquo;bhargo depasya dhimahi&rsquo; (ibid. p.

<p>This persistence of Indian culture and civilization for Beveral millennia requires an explanation and a consideration of the fundamental conceptions, values and characteristics of that civilization would enable us to offer a satisfactory one Indian culture and civilization have a distinct personality and should not and could not be judged by purely European standards.</p>

Bagchi (Hind Kitabs, 1950), particularly chapters II and III.Conceit of nations about their Mission</p>
<p>1619</p>
<p>Various peoples during past centuries had the conooit that they were far superior to others and had a mission to propagate. When the British empire became so extensive that the Sun never set on it', many British imperialists olaimed (most hypo oritioally) that they were carrying on the white man&rsquo;s burden 2605 A for the benefit and betterment of undeveloped and backward people ( when British Imperialism was impoverishing</p>
<p>to the utmost the people whom they governed by their colonial policies as will be briefly indicated later on so far as India is concerned). Russia claims that it has the mission to liberate the proletariat from capitalism and to bring about a Paradise on Earth, The Germans under Hitler believed that they belonged to the superior Nordic race and that they would save the world from communism. Such a conceit is not confined to the West. The Chinese believed that they alone were civilized. The Japanese hold that their Emperor is the son of Heaven. In these days some Indians also claim that spirituality existed nowhere except in India. It is quite correct to say that ancient Indian culture and civilization were based on great spiritual values. It would be entirely in the wrong to say that other people had no spirituality. All that we can at most say is that spirituality is more basic to Hinduism and was more diffused among Hindu people than anywhere else. The Manusmṛti provides that only those usages of varpas and mixed castes that are traditionally prevalent in the country of Brahmāvarta, in Kurukṣetra, in the countries of Matsya, Pañoala (the country called Doab) and Sūrasena (round about Mathurā) are spoken of as sadācāra (II, 17–19) and that all men on the earth should learn their respective duties from brāhmaṇas born in those countries. The Manusmrti exoludes the countries of Madhyadeśa (as defined by it) and Aryāvarta from this provision (II 21–). Recently, some people appear to rely on the words &lsquo;kļṇvanto visvam-aryam&rsquo; occurring in Rg. IX. 63. 5-6 and hold that the Veda has put forward the mission of our country as making the whole world arya. But there is hardly any foundation for this conceit. These words ooour about the offering of Soma juice (indavah) to Indra. They only mean this-these Soma libations, brown in colour, 2506 (prossed from Soma plant) increase (the</p>

There is here no reference whaterer to Vedic people making the whole world Ārya. At the most these verses may be interpreted as suggesting that Soma sacrifices to Indra would make the world Arya. Then there is no message in it which modern Indians can give and spread. Soua plant itself became unavailable in Vedic times and substitutes had to be utilized. And hardly any Bolemn Vedic sacrifices have been performed for centuries in India and very rarely, if at all, Soma sacrifices.</p>
<p>During the last four or five hundred years the Western pations professing Christianity started on a career of conquest, exploitation of undeveloped countries and peoples, colonial empires, use of the discoveries of science for competitivo pur poses, the amassing of wealth with such ideologies as those expressed in the words everybody should be for himself and the devil take the hind-most.' But the devastation and atrocities of the last two world wars and the possibility of the annihilation of the human race or a very large part of it by atomic warfare have now opened the eyes of many thoughtful leaders and people in the West that, if modern civilization is to be saved, they must cultivate regard for spiritual values, love of righteousness and justice, sympathy with the oppressed, and active belief in the brotherhood of man. Though our ancient sages and lawgi vers laid great emphasis on spiritul values, &amp; very large majority of our people and so-called leaders have been wanting in the practice of those values for centuries. Instead of merely praising our past glories, the prosent author would humbly request all educated Indians to be introspective and to ponder over cortain questions that are often asked and seek to find the reasons for the loss of our freedom from the 13th century onwards. (1) Why Hindus were generally found inferior to the invaders, Persian, Greek, Scythian, Turk, English, even though Indians far outnumbered and even though most invaders were impressed by the courage and perfect indifference to death on the part of India&rsquo;s soldiers; (2) Why Hindus could not form</p>

We must enter upon a thoroughgoing and honest inquiry into our past to find our own defects (political and others ) that led to our fall for centuries and try to remove those defects as quiokly as possible, now that Bhārata has won independence after centuries. There was no political unity of the whole of India till the British began to rule over the whole of India. There were constant wars among Hindu kingdoms and princes. For example, because the Marathas invaded Bengal, the Bengalis hated Marathas and were jubilant Over the defeat of the Marathas by the British. We Indians hardly had any deep-seated feeling of all Indians being one people or of nationalism till the 2nd half of the 19th century A. D. This chapter cannot discuss at length the subject of the causes of the downfall of India, politically and in other respects. But a few remarks would not be altogether out of place here.</p>
<p>Hinduism is a combination of many systems and religious ideologies including Vedic ritualism, Vedāntic thought, Vaiṣṇayism, Saivism, Shāktism and primeval cults, adapted to the requirements of different types of men and communities with great disparities of intellectual and spiritual attainments. There were only a few matters that would be said to have bound most of the Hindus to each other, viz. the doctrine of Karma and Punarjanma, the unifying influence of the vast and venerated Sanskrit literature that gradually enriched the regional langu ages, the veneration in which the Vedas were held by all Hindus as the final authority in religious matters, though only a small minority could learn and understand them, the geogra phical unity of the country from the Himalaya to Cape Comorin emphasized by the Purāṇas and by the pilgrimages to holy places from Mānaga lake and Badrinath to Rameśvara. These few elements, however, were not enough to neutralize the causes that militated against effective unity amongst all Hindus. Most of the acāryas and saints laid too much emphasis on other worldiness and Vedanta and did not lay equal or greater emphasis on or recognize the importance of active and thorough performance of people&rsquo;s duties to themselves, to their families, and to society, the result being that many people, whether fit or unfit, tried to become otherworldly and did not actively pursue worldly values with righteousness. Another cause of disunity</p>
<p>1622</p>
<p>[seo. X, Oh. XXXVI</p>
<p>and downfall was the great disparity between the high meta physical teaching of the whole world being one and the treatment meted out to lower classes and untouchables, owing to ideas of exclusiveness, of purity and pollution by touch &amp;o. The education of the masses was greatly neglected2607 and the bigher classes did not seriously mind who ruled the country as long as their life was not much disturbed. The great patriot and revolu tionary Savarkar, hammered on seven fetters by which Hindu society wag bound for conturies, viz. untouchability, prohibitions of several kinds viz. soa travel, of mutual dining among the hundreds of castes and subcastes, of intercaste marriages, of Veda study against several castes, prohibition against following certain occupations and prohibition against re-admission to Hinduism of people that were converted to other religious faiths by force, fraud or ignorance.</p>
<p>Our cultural bistory shows some central features which may be mentioned in one place here. The first is that there has been an unbroken religious tradition from the Vedic times almost to the present day. Vedic mantras are still employed throughout the whole of India in religious rites and ceremonies by all brāhmaṇas and by a large number of the members of castes claiming to be Ksatriyas and Vaisyas. The Vedic gods are not entirely forgotten. Kindling of Agoi is still required at the beginning of all rites; Viṣṇu (though not so frequently praised as Indra, Agni or Varuṇa, yet often enough, is praised in Rg. I. 22 . 16-21, I. 154. 1-6, I. 155. 1-6, VI. 69. 1-8, both Indra and Viṣnu are praised in Rg. VII. 99. 1-7, Atharvaveda VII. 27.4-9 ) and Siva (Rudra of the Rgveda, transformed a great deal yet highly praised in Rg. II. 1.6, II, 33,9, X. 92.9 where he is spoken of as Siva) are even now the principal deities worshipped. In the morning and evening Sandhyā worship, brāhmaṇas in many parts of India still repeat respectively verses addressed to Mitra (Rg. III. 59 ) and Varupa (Rg. I. 25 ). The second feature is that, India being a vast country (as large as the whole of Europe minus Russia ), central authority in political power never existed (except perhaps for a short time under Asoka). The ideal was that of supreme ruler ( samrāt or cakravartin). But, if &amp; king submitted, acknowledged the prowess of the successful conqueror</p>

<p>and paid some tribute, no sarrat troubled himself to look into tho affairs of the kingdoms ruled by petty kings. There could, therefore, be no common front against a foreign invader, no uniformity in laws, customs and practices and there were frequent wars among kings and petty princes. A third feature was that there did not develop a serious clash of cultures, there was tolerance about varying ideologies and beliefs and constant adaptation to create harmony in diversity.</p>
<p>It makes one sad to find that not a single Hindu scholar resembling Alberuni came forward to inquire into the causes of the successful invasions of India by Mahmud of Gazni and later hordes. Intellectuals were mostly engaged at least from the 11th century onwards in composing works of thousands of pages on such topics as Vrata, Dāna, Srāddha ( as the very learned minister Hemādri did) or in mental gymnastics about logic, Vedānta, Poetics and similar subjects and appear to have bestowed little thought on finding means of meeting the onslaught of foreignons or the remedies for removing their own weaknesses and defects. There were also other causes of the downfall of Hindus. Our intellectuals did not or could not pursue and make their own discoveries of science and technology made in the world from the 15th century A. D. Shahaji purchased firearms from foreigners. Neither he, nor his great son Shivaji, the founder of the Maratha empire, started factories for the manufacture of up-to-date firearms and cannon. Similarly, our people did not properly appreciate the role of a powerful navy. If the Hindus or their rulers had possessed a powerful navy they would have been able to nip in the bud the ambitions of the Portuguese, the French and the English,</p>
<p>We must now get out the important characteristics of Hindu culture and civilization.</p>
<ol>
<li>The most striking conception even as early as the Rgveda is that there is only one Reality or Essence, in spite of the fact that people speak of it or worship it as Indra, Mitra, Vartiṇa, Agni &amp;o. ( Rg. I. 164. 46, VIII. 58. 1, X. 129. 2. q. above on p. 1487). In the Mahābhārata, Purānas, in classical Sanskrit Poetry and even in medieval times, when there were various aults and schisms, such as the worship of Viṣṇu or Siva or Sakti, almost all Hindus had an inner consciousness that God is one though oalled by various names; vide p. 118 note 306, p. 973 and note 1593 above, and Harivansa (Viṇṇuparva 23. 31 ), Kumāra Bambhava VII, 44.</li>

<li>From this conception arose the great tolerance that Hinduism at all times showed to freedom of thought and worship, which has been dwelt upon by the present author in H. of Dh. Vol. II p. 388 note 928, Vol. V. pp. 970-71, 1011-1018 (references to Asoka&rsquo;s edicts and Yaj. I. 343 and numerous instances of Indian kings and donors of one persuasion making gifts to temples and institutions of other cults and persuasions ); vide also Gitā 7. 21-22 and 9.23. To hunt down heretics, real or supposed, has been a favourite business of some religiong3603 for centuries. This has been absent from Hinduism. Hindusim is not bound by any fixed creed nor does it rely on a single book2608 or a prophet as its founder. All that it requires is that man shoud be God-fearing and what matters is not correct beliefs but moral conduct and social behaviour. Hindus do not deny the truth of any religion or reject the validity of another man&rsquo;s religious experience. A verse2609 quoted below breathes a broad-minded approach to religious beliefs and worship &lsquo;May Hari, the Lord of the three worlds, bestow on you the desired reward, whom the Saivas worship as Siva, Vedāntins as brahman, the Bauddhas as Buddha, the Naiyāykas proficient in the means of knowledge as the Creator, those devoted to Jain teachings as Arbat and Mimāṁsakas as Yajña&rsquo;. The great logician Udayana who composed his Lakṣaṇāvali in saka 906 (984 A. D.) breathes in his Nyayakusumanjali the same spirit as is contained in the verse translated above. Tolerance is thus of the essence of Hinduism and even an atheist is often met with amusement and not with persecution.</li>

<p>Vedānta doctrine of one in the many and many in one 1625</p>
<p>conclusion that the individual self is non-different from the one Essence, that all manifoldness is only apparent, that even fishermen, slaves, gamblers and the inanimate world are non-different from it. This Vedānta doctrine is one of the most characteristic features of Hinduism and is India&rsquo;s great contribution to the spiritual development of man, though there are sporadic instances of this doctrine having been held by some ancient philosopbers in other lands. This idea of one in the many and many in one is the very core or centre of Vedānta. This has been dealt with above ( vide pp. 1499-1500 notes 2451-52 and pp. 1509-10). In Europe the study of philo sophy is an end in itself. In ancient India this idea of the unity in diversity was made the basis of education and sociology and it was held that the realization of this unity in one&rsquo;s life was the highest freedom (mokṣa).</p>
<p>The Upaniṣadic teaching is a universal doctrine in which all men of good will can meet and combine, in whatever religion they might have been brought up from their childhood. Many illustrations are adduced in the Upaniṣads to bring home non-difference to the inquirer about the Essence. But two are very apt. The Mundaka Upaniṣad ( III, 2.8) declares &ldquo;just as rivers flowing ( towards the ocean) become morged in the ocean after giving up their names and forms, so the man who realizes (knows ), being free from name and form, attains the divine Person that is higher than the highest&rdquo;. The Praśnopaniṣad has (VI.5) the same illustration in prose. The Kathopaniṣad IV. 15 states * just as pure water poured into pure water assumes the same form ( appearance ), similarly the soul of the sage who has realized (the Essence ) becomes the Atman (Self). Deussen in his address on 20th February 1893 before the Asiatic Society of Bombay (in J. B. B. R. A. S. No. 18 for 1893 Art 20 pp. 330-340) after quoting the verge of Mundaka III, 2. 8 remarks “It is not the falling of the drops in the infinite ocean, it is the whole ocean returning to that which he really is and has never ceased to be, to his own all-pervading eternal almighty nature&rdquo; and concludes (p. 340) “ Vedānta in its unfalsified form is the strongest support for morality, is the greatest consolation in the sufferings of life and death; Indians, keep to it,&rdquo; Vide V.S. II. 3.43, where reference is made to Atharvaveda &lsquo;Brahma daśā brahma dāsa brahmeme kitavā uta&rsquo; ( occurring in the Paippalada version as shown by Prof. Durgamohan Bhattacharya in his paper on a</p>

<p>IV. From very ancient Vedic times one of the fundamental conceptions of our Indian culture has been the idea of three spiritual and religious debts owed by a person to the sages, gods and pits, which he paid off by the study of the ancient lore, by sacrifices, and by having a son or sons respectively. This subject has been dealt with at length in the H, of Dh. Vol. II pp. 270, 425, 560-61, 676, Vol. VII p. 416 and above. p. 1318 note 2168. To these three debts the Mabābhārata added a fourth viz. the debt owed to all men:paid off by goodness (vide H. of Dh. Vol. III p. 416 1. 675 ). Sabara on Jaimini VI, 2.31 explains that this doctrine is not confined to brāhnianas but to all members of the three classes, the word &lsquo;brāhmana&rsquo; used in the Tai. S. and other Vedic texts being only illustrative.</p>
<p>V. Another set of values is contained in the conception of puruṣārthas ( ends or goals of human endeavour) viz. Dharma (right conduct), Artha ( economics, politics and civics ), Kama (life of sex, of pleasures and aesthetics ), Moksa (salvation, release or recovery by the self of its real nature and freedom from the bondage of low desires and aims). Mokṣa is said to be the highest goal (parauapuruṣārtha) and the first three are spoken of as &lsquo;trivarga&rsquo;. The concept of Dharma is a far-reaching one and has been emphasized from very ancient times and refers to the principles which men have to observe in their lives and in social relations. This subject of puruṣarthas and of dharna has been dealt with at some length in H. of Dk. Vol. 1 pp. 2-11 and Vol. III pp. 8-10 and 239-241. Therefore, only a few matters would be briefly emphasized here. It has been shown above on pp. 1-21 how the Rgveda had three words viz. gla (cosmic order), vrata (laws or ordinances deemed to be laid down by a god or gods) and dharma (religious rites or sacrificos or fixed principles), how gradually rta receded into the back ground and &lsquo;satya&rsquo; took its place and Dharma became an all-embracing conception and vrata came to be restricted to sacred vows and rules of conduct. When a teacher was about to take leave of the pupil at the end of the latter&rsquo;s studenthood he placed in his final exhortation (Tai. Up. I. 11 ) Truth as the first and Dharma as next to it (satyam yada dharmam cara ). The Bș. Up. 1. 4. 14 equates Satya with Dharma. One of the noblest prayers occurs in the Bṭ. Up. (I. 3. 28 ) &lsquo;from falsehood lead me unto truth, from darkness unto light, from death</p>
<p>Noble prayers and virtues emphasized in Upaniṣads 1627 unto life eternal&rsquo;. The same Upaniṣad in V. 2. 3 inculcates on all men the three cardinal virtues of self-restraint ( dama), charity ( dāna) and compassion ( dayā). The Ohān. Up. V. 10 quotes a verse' the thief stealing gold, the drinker of liquor, one who dishonours his guru&rsquo;s bed and the murderer of a brāhmaṇa&ndash; these four fall ( into hell ) and the fifth is one who associates with them.' It would be noticed that this anoient verse contains some of the ten commandments of the Bible. In spite of these ) (noble Upanisadia teachings of Dharma and morality, Prof. Keith ( in &lsquo;Religion and Philosophy of the Veda and Upaniṣads &lsquo;, Vol. II. p. 584, ed. of 1925) makes the pontifical but peryonse pro nouncement that&rsquo; the ethical content of the Upanigads is negligible and valueless. It is not necessary to combat here his views. Most scholars would rather follow Schopenhauer (quoted in S. B. E. Vol. I, p. LXI) and Deusson (quoted above in Vol. II. p. 424 ) rather than Keith. The concept of Dharma began to occupy the highest position in the times of the Upanisads. The Bṭ. Up. I. 4.14 states there is nothing higher than Dharma.&rsquo; The Tai,2610 Āranyaka avers &lsquo;Dharma is the support (or prop) of the whole world&rsquo;. The Mahabhārata and Manu repeatedly refer to the high value of Dharma. The Mahābhārata claims that everything concerning the four puruṣārthas is contained in it and that what is not contained in it about them would be found in no other work. In Udyogaparva it is stated &lsquo;Dharma is so called because of its character as the sustainer of all beings.&rsquo; Vanaparve and Manu both declare Dharma when violated kills the violator, when preserved it preserves man; therefore, Dharma should not be violated lest Dharma might destroy us.' Vyāsa winds up the Mahābhārata with the solemn appeal with arms up-raised 1 here raise a loud cry, but no one listens to me; from Dharma spring wealth and satisfaction of all desires, why is Dharma not resorted to ? One should not give up Dharma for some desired object, nor through foar nor from greed nor even for the</p>

<p>This sharma must</p>

<p>sake of life itself. Dharma is eternal, pleasure and pain are impermanent, the individual self is eternal, but the conditions (under which self works ) are impermanent.' The Mahābhāra ta passages quoted in n. 18 p. 8 of H. of Dh. Vol. II say the three ( Dharma, Artha, Kama ) are meant for all men, that Dharma is the best of the three, that Artha is middling and Kāma is the lowest and that if there be conflict then Dharma must be followed and the other two abandoned.' This shows that Artha and Kāma were made subservient to Dharma ( the ethical code ) and all three were subservient to the spiritual goal. Our Sāstras do not at all prescribe asceticism for all, but they recognized a scale of values. The Manusmrti (IV.3 and 15 ) provides' one should accumulate wealth for securing only his needs by actions proper for his station ( varna &amp;c) and without harm to his body. One should not desire to acquire wealth by excessive attachment nor by actions condemned by Śāstra nor when be has already enough wealth nor from any kind of person (a sinner or like ), even when he is in straightened circumstances. Āp. Dh. S. (II. 8. 20 22-23) declares that man should enjoy all such pleasures as are not against Dharma; by doing 80 be secures both worlds ( this life and life in the next world ). Gautama Dharmagūtra3611 IX. 46-47 and Yāj. I. 115 practically say the same thing. In the Bhagavadgitā (VII. 11 ) Kispa identifier himself with Kāma that is not in conflict with Dharma. The Arthasāstra of Kautilya no doubt says (I. 7) that. Artha is the chief among the three puruṣārthas', but he also provides that one should enjoy a life of pleasures in such a way as not to conflict with Dharma and Artha, that one should not lead a life devoid of pleasures altogether. The Anuśāsa naparva (chap. III. 18-19 ) states that Dharma, Artha and Kāma are the three prizes ( fruits ) of human life, these three should be striven for but in such a way as not to coflict with Dharma'. The Manusmrti (V. 56 ) declares that eating flesh, drinking intoxicants and sexual intercourse are not sinful in themselves; all beings are naturally inclined to these; but abstention (from these ) leads to great rewards (and therefore Śāstra emphasizes abstention)'. The Rāmāyaṇa ( Araṇyakāpda 9.30 ) contains a statement similar to Svargarohanaparva 5.62.</p>

<p>When reforms are suggested in these days, conservative people put forward the plea that ours is &lsquo;sanātana-dharma&rsquo; 2612 and so no changes should be introduced. But the words &lsquo;sanātana dharma&rsquo; do not mean that Dharma always stands still or is immutable; all that those words mean is that our culture is very ancient and has a long tradition behind it but they do not mean that Dharma permits no change. As a matter of fact funda mental changes in conceptions, beliefs and practices have been made from ancient times to the medieval times by means of various devices. Attention may be drawn to a few. Veda was all in all in very ancient times but in the Upaniṣads this was changed, the Muṇdaka I. 1. 5 designating the four Vodas as inferior knowledge ( aparā vidyā) and the knowledge of the immutable brahman as the higher vidyā; in the Chān. Up. VII. 1.4, the four Vedas and several other branches of knowledge are called by Sanatkumāra (whom Narada approached for instruction) mero name (nāma). Yajñas were the most important religious practice in the early Vedic period, but the Mundaka Up. I. 2.7 designates them as leaky boats and regards those who hold them as the best thing to be fools. Vide above pp. 1265–72 about changes in the views on anuloma marriages, on the topio of whose food may be partaken even by a brāhmana, the abrogation of many Vedic practices by the doctrine of Kalivarjya ( matters forbidden in Kali age ) &amp;c. Manu, Yāj., Viṣṇudharmasūtra, Viṣnu and other purāṇas expressly provide that one should not observe but give up what was once Dharma, if it has come to be hateful to the people and if it would end in unhappiness ( vide p. 1270 n. 2071 above). The Sāntiparya2613 expressly states that what was adharma (in one age) may become dharma in another</p>

<p>and that dharma and adharma are both subjeot to the limitations of country and time. Kāma also was not neglected, as the Kama gūtra (particularly its chapter on Dāgaraka-vykta ' I. 4) will show. The extensive Nātyaśāstra of Bharata ( containing about 5000 verses ) is a witness to the aesthetic enjoyment of dance, music and drama in ancient India by thousands of ordinary men and women,</p>
<p>Hindu thought on the three goals of human life came to this ' do your duty, do not fall into temptations, perform duties for their own sake ( Gita II, 47, III, 19 ), do unto others as you would be done by (Gitā VI. 32, Anusasanaparva 113. 8-9, śānti 259. 20. = Cr. ed. 251. 19), earn wealth but without conflict with dharma and without injury to others and lead a chaste sexual life and enjoy aesthetic pleasures. These summarise the teachings underlying the conceptions of the three puruṣārthas. There was hardly any real pessimism2614 in the principal Dharmaśāstra works except perhaps here and there in the Mahābhārata. They consider life to be worth living, provided all actions are informed by the dictates of Dharma. Manu ( XII. 88-89 ) provides that Karma (conduct or actions ) proscribed by the Veda is of two kinds, viz. pravītla and nivștta, the former leading to happiness in this world and to svarga, and the latter to niṇśreyasa (mokṣa) and requiring complete absence of all hankerings proceded by realization of brahma The Anuśāgana parva ( chap. 146. 76-80 ) divides Dharma into pravsttilakṣana (characterized by persistent activity) and nivșttilakṣaṇa (characterised by abstention from worldly activities and desires), which latter is to be followed for mokṣa and lays down certain practical and salutary rules viz. one should constantly make gifts according to one&rsquo;s ability, constantly offer sacrifices and perform rites to secure one&rsquo;s prosperity. One should collect wealth following what is right and such wealth obtained righte ously should be divided into three parts; one should secure both dharma and artha with one-third of the wealth aoquired, one-third should be spent on Kāma (i, e, chaste sexual life and enjoyment of other pleasures not in conflict with dharma ) and one-third he should increase. Manu (VII. 99 and 101) prescribes similar rules for the king. The same parvan (Agusagana chap. 144, 10-25</p>
<p>2614, The Bible was very pessimistic, both Christ and Saint Paul regard the world as evil or at least spoiled. Christ calls upon people not to resist evil ( vide Hobhouse · Morals in evolution &lsquo;Vol. II, p. 152).</p>
<p>Provisions for all ordinary men</p>
<p>1631</p>
<p>and 31-39 ) dwells at length upon those actions that lead men to heaven (the phrase &ldquo;te narāḥ avarga-gaminaḥ&rsquo; is repeated in each Verse). These provisions are meant for all ordinary people. The Rāmāyaṇa 2615 quotes a popular Verge that man is not oondem ned to never-ending misery but joy comes to a man even after a hundred years if he be alive.</p>
<p>The 4th Puruṣārtha Moksa can be obtained only by a few. It is not a bow which every man or any man can make strung. It was a very difficult path like a razor&rsquo;s edge (Katha Up. III. 14), far more difficult than the path of devotion to &amp; Personal God (Bhagavadgitā XII. 5). The Upaniṣadic doctrine of liberation comes to this that man&rsquo;s nature is really divine, that it is possible for a human being to know and become actually identi. fied with the Godhead, that this should be the ultimate goal of man&rsquo;s life, that this can be achieved by one&rsquo;s ows efforts, but the way to achieve this goal is most difficult and requires the aspirant to give up egotism, selfishness and worldly attachments, Besides, there is another difficulty. The conceptions about mokṣa differ in the different schools of thought like Nyāya Saṅkhya, Vedānta. Even in the Vedānta the conception about Moksa on the part of the different ācāryas differs. Some declared that there were four stages in Mukti viz. Salokya (place in Lord&rsquo;s world ), Sāmipya ( proximity ), Sārūpya ( attaining same form as God ) and Sayujya (absorption ). 2616 These matters cannot be gone into hero,</p>

<p>Dharma is divided into different classes from different standpoints. One classification is into srauta ( based on the Vedas ) and Smārta (based on Smṛtis ). There was another and a more comprehensive classification of Dharma into six classes viz. varnadharma ( duties and rights of varṇas), āśramadharma (rules about the aśramas), varpāśramadharna ( rules enjoined because the person belongs to a certain class and was also in a certain asrama (8.g. the rule that a brāhmaṇa brahmaoāri should carry a staff of palāśa tree), guṇadharma (rules for one who holds or occupies a certain position, as in the case of a king ), naimittikadharma ( rules that have to be observed only on certain occasions such as bath on an eclipse, expiation for a lapse and lastly sāmānyadharma ( duties common to all ( such as those described in pp. 10-11 of the H. of Dh. Vol. II), This leads on to the next important characteristic of Hindu culture and society, viz. varṇas and castes.</p>
<p>VI. Varnia and custe. The subject of the origin of varna classification, the caste system and the duties, privi leges and disabilities of the four varnas have been dealt with at length in the History of Dharmaśāstra Vol. II. pp. 19–164. It has been shown that the word &ldquo;varna&rsquo; (colour) has been applied to Aryas and clāsas in the Rgveda, that these two (āryas and dāsas ) were opposite camps, that brāhmaṇas and kṣatriyas are mentioned in the Rgveda, but the word varṇa has not been expressly connected with them. The words Vaisya and Sūdra do not occur in the Rgveda except in the Puruṣasūkta (Rg. X. 90. 12 ) but even in that hymn the word&rsquo; varna&rsquo; is not employed with reference to them. That hymn is held to be comparatively a late one by most modern scholars. It may be conceded that at the time when the Puruṣasūkta was composed the community was divided into four groups viz brāhmaṇas (thinkers, learned men, priests ) kṣatriyas (rulers and warriors), vaiśyas (common people following agriculture and crafts ) and sudras ( those that did menial work). Such a division of people into four groups is not unnatural and is found in many countries even now. In England there are aristocratic families, there is the middle class and the workers in factories &amp;c. They are not necessarily based on birth alone, though largely so based. It has been shown above (p. 1265 ) that intermarriages between brāhmaṇas and the other varnas were allowed up to the time of the Yājā. valkya Smrti which expresses its dissent from its predecessors</p>
<p>No evidence of prohibition of marriage among four varṇas 1633</p>

XVII. 13, Tai, Br, III, 4, 2-3 numerous artisans and craftsmen such as takṣan, rathakāra, kulāla, karmāra, niṣāda, sūta and others are mentioned but it is extremely doubtful whether they had become petrified caetes at the period of these works. Rathakāra and karmāra and sūta are mentioned in Atbaryaveda III. 5. 6-7. It is probable that by the time of the Chan. Up. V. 10.7 Cāṇdalas had become untouchables (like dogs and hogs ) and Paulkaga seems to be equated with Cāṇdāla in Br. Up. IV.3.22. Even in the times of Yājāavalkya and Parāśara (2nd to 6th century A.D.) a brāhmaṇa was permitted to take food at the house of such śūdras as bis dāsa, cowberd, barber, a tenant of his land on the rent of half share of crops ( vide above p. 1266 ). The varnas were only four, there was no fifth varṇa (Manu X, 4 and Anuśāganaparva, chap. 48. 30), though in modern time untou obables are often spoken of as pañcamas ( against Smrti usage ). The word jāti in the sense of caste hardly ever occurs in Vedic literature but it occurs in the Nirukta ( XII. 13 ) and in Pāṇini (V. 4. 9 ), who explains brāhmaṇajātiya' as meaning one who is a brāhmaṇa by caste'. Sometimes, Jāti and Varpa are differentiated in Smrtis (Yāj. II. 69, 260 ), but from ancient times the word Jāli is confounded with the word Varna. Manu (X. 31 ) uses the word Varpa in the sense of mixed castes; conversely, the word Jāti is employed in the sense of Varpa ' in Manu ( VIII, 177, IX. 85-86, X. 41 ).</p>
<p>A sort of caste system existed in several countries such as Persia, Rome and Japan, but it disappeared and had never attained the complexity of the Indian Caste system.</p>
<p>There are now several thousand castes and sub-castes in India. How they arose is, according to the present author, an insoluble problem. Sherring in Hindu Tribes and Castes' (1881, vol. III, p. 231 ) beld that caste was an invention of the brāhmaṇas ). How such a huge system could be invented and imposed upon millions of people by a small minority without physical or political power never occurred to the prejudiced Christian missionary of the third quarter of the 19th century.</p>

<p>History of Dharmasisira</p>
<p>onwards India was being invaded by Persians, Kambojas,2617 Greeke, Scythians ( generally held to be the same as Sakaa), and people like Pāradas, Pablavas, Cinas, Kirātas, Daradas (Dards ) and Khaśas emigrated into India. Manu ( X, 43-44 ), after mentioning these and Paundrakas, Odras ( Orissa ), Dravidas, asserts that these were originally Ksatriyas but had become Sūdras because the sacraments like Upanayana bad ceased among them and because they lost contact with brāhmapas, Manu X. 45 shows that in his day there were mixed castes that spoke mleocha tongues and Arya languages but were treated as dasyus ( śūdras). Gautama-dharmazūtra (IV. 14-17 ), Manu X. 5-40, Yāj. I, 91-95 and many other works dilate upon the rise of inixed castes from the trarriages or unions of men and women of different vargas and declare how further castos and sub-castes arise from the marriages and unions of men and women belong ing to different classes and castes. This was called Vurn isunkara or simply sarkara, about wbich Arjuna expressed concern ( Gitā I. 41-42) and against which the Bhagavad-gitā (111. 24-25 ) inveighs bitterly. It was stated by Gautama (Dh, S. VIII, 3) that the prosperity ( of the castos and sub-castes ), protection and the non-mixture (of varnas ) depend on the king and learned brābmaṇas. The Nasik Inscription of king Siri Pulumāyi (E. I. Vol. VIII. p. 60 about 130 A. D.) extols the king as baving prevented the intermicgling of vardas (Varpasankara).</p>

<p>oaste of a person on account of the confusing mixture of Varnas; all men raise progeny from all sords of women; therefore, those who are wise regard character as the principal and desirable matter' (q. in H. of Dh. vol. II. p. 61 n. 149). The original scheme of varpas was natural and based on the work that men put in for the community as a whole. It was not based on birth. The ideas underlying the original varṇa system made the nearest approach towards a society in which there was no attempt to secure a competitive equality but in which the interest of all groups were regarded as identical. In Vedic times there were only classes and pot castes in the modern sense. Even in the smrtis when many castes had arisen the greatest emphasis was laid on duties rather than on privileges and on high moral character and the value of the effort made by a man. It is therefore stated in the Gitā ( IV. 13 ) that the system of four varṇas was created on the basis of quality (or on the basis of sattra, rajas and tamas ) and actions and (in XVIII. 42-44 ) it specifies the qualities and actions required in the four varṇas as an ideal, viz. serenity of mind, self-control, austerity, purity, forbearance, straightforwardness, wisdom ( spiritual knowledge ), knowledge (of all kinds ), faith (in God ) these are the natural actions ( duties ) for a brāhmaṇa; bravery, fury, energy, steadiness, capability, not running away in battle, charity and rulership these are duties of a kṣatriya; agriculture, keeping herds of Cows (and cattle ), trade and commerce-these are the natural duties of the Vaibya; work of the nature of service is the natural duty of the Sūdra. These words of Gitā cannot be used for supporting the present scheme of thousands of castes and sub-castes of water-tight character. If birth had been regarded as the sole or principal basis, the words in the Gita 2619</p>

It would be noticed that out of the nine harmūṇi specified as natural to brāhmaṇas most are moral and spiritual and do emphasis is laid on the element of birth. At the time of the Mabābhārata there must have been a great deal of ferment, some revolt and criticism about the petrified caste system. The epic frequently refers to the theme of vardas and jātis. Vide for example, Vanaparva (chapter 180), Virātaparva 50. 4-7, Udyoga 23. 26, 40, 25-29, Santi 188. 10-14, Anusāsana 143. A few passages may be got out here. Santi 188. 10 says there is no (real) distinction between the varpas, (since ) the whole world is of Brahmi, since it was formerly created by Bralmā, and has had the system of varnas on account of the various actions (of men)'; Santi ( 189, 4 and 8) &amp;vers that man is known as brāhmana in whom are seen truthfulness, generosity, absence of hate, absence of wickedness, shame (restraint for avoiding wrong-doing), compassion and a life of austerity; if these signs are observed in a sūdra and are not found in a brāhmana, then the sūdra is not a sūdra ( should</p>

A similar passage ooours in Vanaparva 216. 14-15 ( quoted above in note 1640 pp. 1005-6 and compared to Dhammapada 393, translated on p. 1005). When the wrangles between Vaiṣpavas and others were at their highest the Bhagavatapurāṇa (VII. 9. 10) avers that a cāndala who is a devotee of Viṣou is superior to a brahmana who is not a devotee of Viṣeū. Apart from the specific qualities required to be possessed by the members of each of the four varpas, all Dharmaśāstra works attach the highest importance to certain moral qualities and enjoin them on all men. Manu X. 63, Yāj. I. 22, Gaut. Dh. S. VII). 23-25, Matsya 52. 1-10 (quoted above on p. 1023 n. 1652) prescribe for all Varnas a brief code of morals, such as abimsa, truthfulness, non stealing (i. e, no wrongful taking of another&rsquo;s property ), purity and restraint of the senses. The Mitakṣarā on Yāj. I. 22 explains that the word &lsquo;saryeṣām &lsquo;therein states that these moral qualities if practised are the means of Dharma for all men from brāhmaṇas to cāṇdālas. Vide H. of Dh. Vol. II pp. 10–11 for different enumerations of dharmas common to all men. The Manusmṛti (1.1) begins by saying that the great sages requested Manu to expound the dharmas of all varnas and of the intermediate castes. This ( viz. the Dharmas of vardas, intermediate castea and asramas ) is the principal topic in most of the smrtia.</p>
<p>A very high ideal was placed before brāhmaṇas ( vide above pp 936-938). They were to study the Veda and its subsidiary lores as a duty (to be discharged ), were to perform sacrifices and make gifts also and their proper means of livelihood were only three viz, teaching the Veda and Śāstras, officiating as priests in sacrifices and receiving religious and other gifts. How arduous learning the Veda was will be clear when it is remembered that a brāhmaṇa who was to be regarded as a very learned one had to memorize one Veda at least. Supposing he was a student of the Rgveda he had to commit to memory the ten thousand and odd verses of the Rgveda, also its pada-patha, its krama. patha, the Brāhmaṇa text (generally the Aitareya ), the six Vedāngas ( auxiliary works) viz. the Kalpagūtra ( of Asyalāyana generally ), Vyakarana ( the Grammar of Pāṇini in about four thousand sūtras ), the Nirukta ( in at least 12 chapters ), metrics, Śikṣā ( Phonetics ) and Jyotiṣa. The first three of these six Vedāngas are rather longish treatises and abstruse. These extensive texts were generally committed to memory without understanding the meaning and so entailed very great strain on</p>
<p>1638</p>
<p>History of Dhar masāstra</p>
<p>the mind and memory. There were thousands of such brāhmaṇas in India up to the beginning of this century, and even now there are still hundreds of such men. They were to teach the Veda without demanding any fee ( demanding a fee to teach Veda was and is regarded as sinful even to this day). They were allowed to receive a fee if the pupil or somebody on his behalf paid something at the end of studenthood. Not only did they trans:nit the Veda free, but there were in the present author&rsquo;s youth in Konkaṇa and Mahārāṣtra many Vaidik brāhmaṇas who gave free board and lodging to several pupils (or arranged to feed them by turns at the houses of brāhmaṇa families in the village or town). All this has now almost stopped owing to rationing during the world wars and present high prices. So teaching hardly brought any regular and substantial amount of money ( vide H. of Dh. Vol. II. pp. 108-110 ). As regards officiating as priests, that was a precarious and fitful source of income. Besides, in Rg. times at least, the scion of a royal family could be a purohita i. . a priest ( vide H. of Dh. Vol. II. p. 109). It should be remembered that all brāhmaṇas were not priests; they could be so if they chose and if they were learned. Further, many learned brābmaṇas refuse even now to act as priests in śrāddhas for pitss ( at least for three years after the man&rsquo;s death ). Pāṇini (V.2.71 ) provides for the forinacion of the word &lsquo;Brāhmanaka&rsquo; meaning a province or country where &lsquo;brāhmaṇas followed the profession of arius&rsquo; and Kautilya (IX. 2 ) also refers to armies of brāhmaṇās, ksatriyas &amp;c. The third source specially permitted to brāhmaṇas was the privilege of receiving religious gifts from a worthy or unblemished person ( vide H. of Dh. Vol. II pp. 110, 11). Brāhmaṇas could follow other occupations in distress, but even then there were great restrictions imposed on them by Śāstras even when they took to other means of livelihood ( vide H. of Dh. Vol. II pp. 118-132).2620 The ideal set before brāhmaṇag was one of poverty, of plain living and high thinking, of forsaking a very active pursuit of wealth, of insisting on the necessity and high value to themselves and the Aryan society of studying, preserving, propagating and augmenting the ancient literature and culture. Kings, rich persons and even</p>

<li>It was, for example, provided by Vasistha (II. 27 ) and Manu X. 92 tbat a brahmana becomes a sūdra by selling milk for three days. Io the present author&rsquo;s boyhood some poor brāhmaṇas had begun to sell milk and the result was that they were very much looked down upon by the villagers. There would be the temptation to add water to the milk to gain money.Ancient ideal set before brāhmanas</li>
</ol>
<p>1639</p>
<p>ordinary men made gifts of lands and houses to learned brāhmaṇas ( which were deemed the most meritorious gifts ) 2621 The present author saw in his boyhood very learned Vaidika brāhmaṇas themselves ploughing their own lands, while repeating inaudibly the Veda (i. e. revising it, as otherwise it might slip from their memory ) and know a middle class Vaidika brābmaṇa family that for seven generations had taught Voda to a number of pupils and provided them with free board and lodging; (out of these seven the present author personally know three generations, the last of whom stopped a few years ago the Vaidika school owing to present high prices of food, decrease in gifts due to the increasing poverty of the people round about and their unconcern for Vedic studies ). Even in the times of the early Upaniṣads, the brāhmaṇa&rsquo;s first duty was to learn and teach the Veda and to take all knowledge for his province. Ajātaśatru, king of Kāsi, exclaimed, when the brābmaṇa Balaki&rsquo; Gārgya approached him for knowledge of brahman, this is against the natural usual course that a brāhmaṇa should approach a kṣatriya to learn about brahman&rsquo; (Bṛ. Up. II, 1. 15). That indicates that many brāhmaṇas must have endeavoured to act up to the old ideal of learning in olden times. They became the custodians of the vast literature that had aocumulated and wag growing every day and were expected to preserve that literature and propagate it. Though every brahmana could not have lived up to the high ideals set up for brāhmaṇas, a very large number must have made as near an approach to the ideal as possible It was the greatness of these letter that led to the glorification of the whole class. In most communities there is a group of the elite, which represents the ideals of the whole community, its essential tendencies and acts up to the ideals. Learning, great moral and spiritual attainments among individuals are rather slusive and impalpable, while birth in &amp; certain family is a very obvious thing. Most people in ancient and medieval times followed the occupation of their forefathers. The kingly office was highly eulogised by Manu ( VIII. 4-8), who propounded the theory that the king represented in his person eight deities ( Indra, Agni, Varuna, the Sun, the Moon, Kubera, Yama and Vāyu) and that the king was a great divinity in human form. The office of the king also was hereditary.</p>

<p>1640</p>
<p>Except in a few cases the brāhmaṇas were never rulers. It was the ksatriyas and śūdras that were rulers. Therefore, &amp; generalisation was made that birth in a particular group or family was a more or less sure indication of the possession of certain qualities generally associated with the members of that group or family. The brāhmaṇas were teachers with no salary, officiated as priests when called and were given fees, but there was no assurance of a continuous and certain payment. They had no church organization 2622 ( such as Archbishops, bishops, priests, deacons in the Anglican Church ) and monasteries for monks among Buddhists and in the Christian Church. The brāhmaṇas were not monks but house. holders who had to maintain a family and bring up children and to make their sons learned and of high moral and spiritual worth. There is no example in the whole world of &amp; small minority of the population of a country, that had no military strength behind it, being revered for at least thirty centuries without any serious challenge not only by the common people but by nobles and kings. What was the basis of the reve rence shown to brāhmaṇas as a class for at least three thousand years? They were believed to be religious, moral and spiritual leaders and the possessors and representatives of an idealistio culture (&lsquo;ideational&rsquo; in the language of Prof. Sorokin ). The gecret of the power of and regard for brāhmaṇas had been the fact that as a class they performed well three of their appointed tasks of study, teaching and comparative renunciation ( in spite of the failings of some individual brāhmaṇas ). The brāhmaṇas had no army to support them and they could not, by devoting themselves to physical sciences, find new sources of income or well-being for themselves or for the whole community.</p>
<p>Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru in his Autobiography (p. 432 ) pays in passing a tribute to the Brāhmaṇa ideal as follows. But the West also brings an antidote to the evils of this cut-throat civilization - the principles of socialism, co-operation and service to the community for the common good. This is not so unlike the old Brabm in ideal of service etc.&rsquo; The ancient Indian culture exalted the mind and soul over the body and henos arose an extra-ordinary development of asceticism,</p>

<p>Abolition of caste system</p>
<p>1641</p>
<p>If in modern times the caste system has broken down and has become harmful and unpopular among all people, it may be sorapped and discarded ( vide above p. 1270 note 2071 for provisions about this ). But such a huge and all-pervading system cannot be destroyed in a short time nor by legislation, What those who desire to destroy altogether the caste system want is not clear. Do they want complete westernization of the whole of India? To the present author this appears to be not only very difficult but almost impossible. Legislation may help a little, but it cannot eradicate within the foroseeable future the mental attitudes and outlook of millions of people. Cases have been reported where village kunbis and craftsmen thre atened to beat untouchables that wanted to draw water from &amp; village well in the presence of a magistrate. If this campaign against the whole caste system is carried on with force, there are sure to be widespread riots and disorders and the Independence of the country attained after two centuries of colonial rule may be jeopardized. Two matters must be carefully considered and strenuously worked for. Government must see to it that nationalism, the emotion of being one people, in spite of differences in some respects, must be instilled from childhood and among the masses. For that purpose free and compulsory education for all children on national lines must be achieved as quickly as possible. Merely inveighing against casteism by leaders would not do, when people often suspect them as guilty of other &lsquo;isms&rsquo; (such as nepotism ). Universal primary and secondary education, growing number of inter-caste marriages, a growing sense of solidarity as to essentials of culture ( though petty differences may exist) would be the first requisites in any scheme of the removal of castes, Besides, very large numbers of self-sacrificing men, of high moral character and devotion to duty would be required for eradicating the evils of the decayed Oaste system. Another matter also must be very carefully considered. What is going to be substituted in place of the old oaste system? People are afraid that a new caste system of ministers, bureaucrats, captains of industry, men in power and workers is going to be substituted without the saving grace of the ancient caste system,</p>
<p>It should not be forgotten that high spiritual life and mokṣa were not denied to the sūdra. It is true that the Purvamimāmsā denied to the sūdra the right to study the Veda and to perform Vedic sacrifices ( VI, I. 26 ). But even in those ancient timea</p>
<p>H, D 206</p>
<p>1642</p>
<p>180o. X, Ch. XXXVI</p>
<p>one sage, Badari, advocated that the sūdra could atudy the Veda and perform Vedic sacrifices (P. M. S. VI. 1. 27). Besides, it should be noted that the sūdra was not at all debarred from a spiritual life and could secure mokṣa by studying the Mahābhārata ( which contains thousands of perses on Mokṣa), which Vyasa compassionately composed for the benefit of women and sūdras and which calls itself (in Adiparva chap. 62. 23 ) Dharmaśāstra, Arthasāstra and Mokṣaśāstra, as declared by the Bhāgavata purāṇa I. 4. 25. All that was decided was that a sūdra could not secure Mokṣa by the study of Veda. Saṅkarācārya on V.S. I. 3. 38 points out that sūdras like Vidura (Ādiparva 63. 96-97 and 114, 106. 24-28, Udyogaparva 41.5 ) and Dharma-vyādha ( Vanaparya 207 ) possesed knowledge of brahmavidyā and that it is impossible to say that they were not able to secure Mokṣa. Vide above pp. 921-2% and note 1468a for the discussion of the relevant passages. It is noteworthy that even in early Vedic times the Rathakāra (a caste not belonging to any of the three higher classes ) was allowed to set up Vedic fires and could repeat certain Vedic mantras for that purpose and the Niṣada ( also not belonging to any of the three varpas, but being a sūdra ) was allowed to perform an iṣti to Rudra with Vedic mantras. Vide pp. 1290-91 (for Rathakāra ) and pp. 1295-96 ( for Niṣāda ) above. These facts show that Vedic sacrifices had penetrated into certain sūdra castes long before the sūtras and smśtis The Bhagavatapurāṇa (VII. 9.10) was prepared to hold that 8 cāṇdāla (by birth ) if he becomes a devotee of Viṣnu was superior to a brāhmaṇa who was not such a devotee.</p>
<p>The disappearance of the caste system, when it comes about, will not at all imply the disappearance or destruction of all that for which Hinduism has stood up during several millennia.</p>
<p>We should not be constantly harping on the oaste system au the only or most basic cause of our downfall. The Moslems Lave no caste system and yet most of the Moslem countries in the world have been backward and under the thumb of Western powers. China, Japan and the countries in S. E. Asia bad hardly anything like the caste system of our country, but the first two about a hundred years ago were very backward and many of the countries in S. E. Asia were within the Colonial Empire of Holland, a small country the population of which is even now only about eleven millions.

<p>Downfall due to lack of certain virtues</p>
<p>1643</p>
<p>royal power remained in India was distributed among about 600 princely States ruled by ksatriyas and others and hardly a dozen brāhmaṇa States existed among those 600. What little trade and commerce existed or was allowed by the British to Indians was in the hands of Parsis, Bhatias, Banias, Marvadis, Jains and Lingayats and the brāhmaṇas had very little share in trade and commerce. It was the brāhmaṇa politi cians like Tilak that insisted on Swadeshi. Agriculture, money lending and Zamindari were mostly in the hands of non-urah maṇas except in Bengal and contiguous territories where the Zamindari system supported by Lord Cornwallis prevailed. Our downfall for centuries was due to lack of certain virtues and idealogies among all our people, high or low. Let us, therefore, all Indians, stop blaming the oaste system for our downfall and try to eradicate it or lessen its evils and cultivate virtues like duty for duty&rsquo;s sake, high endeavour, high moral character, nationalism, freedom and justice.</p>
<p>VI. Aśramas : Another important characteristio of our culture is the system of Aśramas, which have been in existence for certainly several centuries before the Christian era. The word Aśrama does not occur in the Vedic Samhitās or Brāhmaṇas, In Sv. Up. VI. 21 oocurs the word ' atyāśramibhyaḥ'( to the best of ascetics ) which indicates that the word ' āśrama&rsquo;had then been known. A generic word comprehending several matters is coined long after the several words for the component parts have been current for centuries. The word śrāddba doos not ooour in any ancient Vedic passages, though the Piṇdapitryajõe ( per formed by an agnihotrin on each Amāvāsyā), the Mahāpitçyajña (performed in the cāturmāsya rite Sākamedha) and the Aṣtaka rites ( all of which are rites in honour of pitȚs) were known in early Vedic literature ( vide H. of Dh. VOL IV. pp. 349–50 ). Similarly, some of the āśram as were certainly known from the times of the Rgveda, The Aśramas 2623 long before the time of the sutra literature at least have been four viz. brahmacarya ( stage of studenthood), gārhasthya (householder stage ), vāpaprasthya ( stage of forest hermit) or vaikhānasa (Gaut. III, 2 ), Sannyasa (stage of ascetic life ) or Mauna or Pārivrājya or Pravrajyā or Bhikṣu ( Gaut. III, 2 ). Asramas have been dealt with in H. of Dh. VOL II pp. 416-426, brahmacarya in H. of Dh. Vol. II pp. 349-382, forest hermit (in pp. 919–929 ) and sandyāga in pp.</p>

<p>History of Dharmaśāstra (Beo. X, Oh.XXXVI 930-975 (of the same volume ). The span of human life is said to be one hundred years or winters or autumns from the times of the Roveda (Rg. VI. 4, 8; 10.7, 12, 6, 17. 15, 24. 10 in all these hundred winters ), VII, 101. 6, X. 161. 3 and 4 (autumns ). As no one could say how long one might live it is not to be supposed that each stage was of 25 years; all that is meant is that a man may, if he lives long, pass through the four stages. The word brahmacārl occurs in Rg. X. 109.9 and Tai, 8. VI. 3. 10.5 and brahmacarya in Tai. S. VI. 3, 10.5 and Tai, Br. III, 10. 11. In Rg. VI. 53. % occurs the word &lsquo;gçhapati&rsquo; (lord of the house ) meaning the same thing as grhastha. Indra is said to be the friend of munis (in Rg. VIII. 17. 14 ) and yatis are said to have praised Indra ( Rg. VIII 6. 18). The Katha Up. IV. 15 saying that the self of the Muna ( knowing the reality) becomes one with the Supreme Self indicates that the reference is to a Sannyāsin who had realized the Supreme Spirit. The Br. Up. IV. 4. 22 saying that the Great Self is the Lord of the universe, that brāhmaṇas seek to know him by study of the Veda, by sacrifices and gifts, by austerities (tapas) and by fasting and that, after realizing that Supreme Self the man becomes a muni, that desiring this stage only the wandering (ascetics ) leave home ( take to that stage ). Here those engaged in tapas are placed at an earlier stage than pravrajyā. Therefore, the Ch. Up. II. 23. 1, speaking about three branches of Dharma, should be taken as mentioning the three āśramas and the words</p>
<p>one who is firmly established in brahman obtains immortality should be taken as referring to the 4th Aśrama. As pointed out in H. of Dh. Vol. II. pp. 928–929 most of the rules laid down for forest hermits are the same as those for the sannyāsin and there was difference between the two in a few matters only. From Br. Up. II. 4.1 ff. and IV, 5. 2 ff. (where the word pravrajiṣyan is used) for udrūsyan (in II. 4. 1) it follows that Yajñavalkya became a sannyāsin (or parivrājaka) immediately after leaving the householder&rsquo;s life. Later op in the Kalivarjya acts the stage of being a forest hermit is included. Vide H. of Db. Vol. II, p. 420 n. 999 on Chān. Up. II. 23.1. The stage of householder ( grhastha) was highly praised. Vide H. of Dh. Vol. II pp. 424-425, 640-41, Vol. V. pp. 1026-27.</p>
<p>The stage of sannyāsa or yati was highly honoured, because it was deemed to lead to mokṣa. The result was that many persons quite unfit to lead the life presoribed for a real sanayisin only entered the order and possessed all the outward</p>
<p>High position of sannyāsins due to virtues</p>
<p>1645</p>
<p>signs of that stage such as wearing ocbro-coloured garments, shaving the head, carrying three staffs and a water jar. They are condemned in the Mahābhārata, śāntiparya 308. 47 (or, ed. = 320. 47 Ch, ed.) quoted in H. of Dh. Vol. II p. 936 n 2151b and above p. 1369 n. 2241 ). Yāj. IIL 58 provides that the sannyāsin should be good to all beings, quiescent, have three dapdas and a water jar and should enter a village for begging alms. Some interpreted the word fridandi as meaning carrying three staffs', while others like Manu XII. 10 and Daksa VII, 30 provide that a person is called tridandı who observes threefold restraint, viz, of speech, mind and body. The sannyāsin was so highly esteemed that for deciding doubtful points of dharma a single ascetic was allowed to do the work of a pariṣad and declare the proper decision (vide H, of Dh. Vol. II p. 969). Similarly, great emphasis was laid on inviting a Yati at a śraddha dinner (vide H. of Dh. Vol. IV pp. 388, 399). The Bșhaj-jātaka ( chapter 15 ) deals with the question about the horoscopio indications for different kinds of ascetics being born on the conjunction of four or more powerful planets in the same sign of the zodiac in the horoscope and adds that according as Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, the Moon, Venus, Saturn, or the Sun is the most powerful of the four or more planets in one sign in a horoscope, the person whose nativity it is becomes respectively an ascetio of the types of Bauddha, Ajivika,2624 a bhikṣu ( i. e. vedio ascetic), Vṛddha (a Kāpālika), &amp; caraka, a nirgrantha (a Jain ascetio ) or one subsiating on forest produce, fruits, roots &amp;c. 3625 This shows that long before Varahamihira (6th century A. D.) so many kinds of ascetics flourished or were common in India.</p>
<p>The varna system classified the whole community and was addressed to people in the mass; the Aśrama theory addresses itself to the individuals in a community and maps out for them</p>

<p>• Philosophy of the Upanisade&rsquo; (English translation of 1906, p. 397 ) says about the Asrama theory that the entire history of mankind does not produce much that approaches in grandeur to this thought.'</p>
<p>VII. The doctrine of Karma and Punarjanma (transmi gration or metem psychosis ).</p>
<p>This is one of the most fundamental dootrines of the Hindu system of religion and philosophy and is unique in its own way, particularly in its long continuity and immense early literature. It has been dealt with above in a separate and extensive chapter ( XXXV pp. 1530 ff). It is not, therefore, necessary to say anything more here.</p>
<p>VIII. Another important doctrine is that of ahiinsā. So far as the Upanisads, Mahābbārata, Dharmaśāstras and Purāpas are concerned the subject of ahirsū has been dealt with above in pp. 944-947 and in Vol. II, p. 30. A few matters are briefly mentioned here. The words kratu and ynjña occur hundreds of times in the Rgveda. The difference sometimes made is this that the word ynjña is yery general (including the five daily religious duties laid down in Manu III. 70), while kralu ia confined to solemn Vedic sacrifices like Somayāga. Panini mentions the two separately (IV.3.68 ) and the Gitā IX, 16 (aham kraturabam yajñaḥ ) also does the same. Animals were offered in some of these, though not in all. Gradually it came to be thought even in the Rgveda times that worshipping Agai with fuel sticks or with an oblation of cooked food or ghee or with Veda study or obeisances or with a solemn sacrifice is on the same level and the worshipper is rewarded with swift horses (dashing against enemies ) and with bighest glory and no trouble whether divine or due to mon, reaches him (Rg. VIII. 19. 5-6). Some Brāhmaṇa texts are couched in the same strain. The Ait. 2626 Br. (VI. 9 ) remarks' he who offers a cake performs a sacrifice equal to the offering of all sacrificial animals'. The Tai, Br. provides that the forest sacrificial animals, after a firebrand is carried around them, are let off for the sake of abiṁsā. Dr. A. Schweitzer in bis &lsquo;Indian thought and its deve lopment&rsquo; (tr. into English by Mrs. Russell, 1936) tries hard to establish a contrast between the attitude of what he calls' world and life negation' in Hindu thought and &lsquo;world and life affir.</p>

<p>• Renaissance of Hinduism&rsquo; pp. 618-634. On p. 2 Dr. Schweitzer boldly asserts that world and life affirmation unceasingly urges men to serve their fellows, society, the nation, mankind and indeed all that lives with their atmost will &amp;c. One should like to know the Biblical passages where all this grand thought is explicitly stated. On p. 4 he contradicts himself when he says. Christianity also brought European thougbt into relation with world and life aegation.' The two great commandments of Jesus are first' to love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul' and the second is &lsquo;thou shalt love thy neigbbour as thyself&rsquo;( vide Matthew 22.37 and 39 and Mark 12. 30-31). This is hardly anything like what Schweitzer says about Christianity&rsquo;s world and life affirmation, Not a word is said here about even loving all buman beings, much less loving all that lives'. The world has had enough of the world and life affirmation of Christianity ( or rather of Christian Dations or people). Attention is invited to H, of Dh. Vol. II. p. 180, where Westermarck&rsquo;s remarks in his Origin and development of the moral ideas' (1912) Vol. I. p. 711 are cited on slavery, The world knows wbat during the last four or five bandred years the colonial empires of Christian countries like England, France, Holland, Belgium, Portagal and Spain did in India, Africa, S, E, Asia, the Congo and America. O p. VII of his Preface he appears to contradict himself when he disagrees with the view of Schopenhauer and Deussen about Indian thought being completely governed by the ideal of world and life negation and admits the fact that &lsquo;world and life affirmation is present at the back of this thought (Indian thought ) from the very dawn of its history, and lifa negation and world and life affirmation constitute its chief characteristic and determine its development&rsquo;. Both books ( Dr. Sweitzor&rsquo;s and Dr. Radbakrishnan&rsquo;s) are reviewed in Hibbert Journal' for 1953 pp. 234-241 and 355-363 by O. W. M. Gell who finds both works disappointing, holds that Schweitzer has misunderstood the Hindu ideal of sopra-ethical man, that aegation and affirmation have not been properly defined by him, that it was only very late in Christian history that the West began to work actively for improvement of social and economic conditions, Social service was not anknown in Ancient India. The very idea of &lsquo;pūrta &lsquo;dharma is social service. Vide above pp. 947-949, The Purāṇas emphasize the importance of work for relieving distressed beings. For example, the Mārkaqdeya has the following very noble sentiment (15. 57).men would not obtain that happiness in heaven or in the world of Brahmā which arises from giving happiness to distressed mea&rsquo; (a ETT T ara a sua at: i vores facforamcurrat Hall)Vide also note 6 op pp. 3-4 of H, of Dh. vol.

<p>Chandogya and other passages about ahimsi. Secondly, the injunction about not giving pain to any being (in Chān. Up.) is immediately preceded by the words &lsquo;having concentrated all his senses on the Self&rsquo;. That shows that one who knows and has come to realize that all is brahma should give no pain to others as all those also are brahma and not on the ground of purity or defilement. Further, in the Mahabharata and Smṛtis some of which at least are not far removed in time from the Upaniṣada both ahimsa and sauca ( purity ) are separately mentioned along with other duties ( dharmas) common to all varpag. Gaut. ( 8. 23-24 ) lays down eight qualities of the soul for every dvija viz, compassion towards all beings, forbearance, freedom from jealousy, freedom from excessive harm ( to himself ), doing auspicious acts, absence of abjectness (or miserliness ), absence of discontent&rsquo;. The same eight are specified in the Matsya purāṇa 52, 8-10, Atrismrti 34-41. Manu V. 46 ( = Viṣnu Dh. 8. 51. 69 ) provides &lsquo;he who does not desire to cage or kill or cause pain to living beings, thus desirous of doing good to all, secures highest ( or never ending ) happiness&rsquo;. Sauca is external ( of the body ) and internal ( of the mind). Manu V. 106 expressly says that he who is pure as to money matters is really pure and not one who washes himself with sand or water. Vide above pp. 1421-22 notes 2331 and 2333. It is worthy of note that the Santiparve (chapter 162, 4-5 = Or. ed. 156, 4-5) contains an apotheosis of Satya as the ancient Dharma and brahman itself and then in verses 7-9 Satya is stated to appear in thirteen aspects such as tyāga ( renunciation of attachment and pleasures ), samata (boing the same to all), dama ( restraint of senses ), kṣamā ( forbearance), hri (being ashamed to boast of one&rsquo;s good deeds ), anasūyā (absence of jealousy ), daya ( compassion ) and so on, ahimsā being the 13th aspect of Satya.</p>

<p>IX. The three paths, viz. Karmamārga, Bhaktimarga and Jāānamārga. These have already been dealt with above in pp. 964-967, 1462. The Bhagavadgita expounds the further doctrina of what is called niṣkāma-karmayoga, which has been explained above on pp. 966–67.

<p>It was recognised in India from very early times that in the matter of religious worship and philosophical doctrinor, there are different grades among human beings. All are not competent to grasp and act upon abstruse metaphysical doctrines or to follow higher forms of worship. This has been brought out in several places before. Vide above p. 973 note 1593 and p. 1462. Abstruse metaphysical doctrines are likely to be misunderstood and therefore we find that there is an effort to koop such doctrines secret and frequent warnings are given in the Upaniṣads not to impart the knowledge of brahman to all and sundry and to keep it secret. Vide p. 1071-72 and Chan. Up. III. 11. 5 set out above on p. 1460, Śv. Up. VI. 22, Katha Up. III. 17, Bļ. Up. III. 2. 13 ( Yājñavalkya and Artabhāga did not discuss brahman among people ). The word Upaniṣad came to mean&rsquo;secret doctrine' (vide Tai. Up. II. 9 and III. 10 ). This tendency to keep abstruse doctrines secret obtained in other nations in antiquity (vide St. Mark 4. 11, 34-35). The Hathayogapradipika 2628 has similar provisions (vide p. 1460 above). Many modern writers condemn people that engage in image worship. The reasons advanced for image worship by Indian works are given in note 1593 p. 973 above. The worshipper of an image of Ganega or Kāli casts the image in water ( a river, sea &amp;o.) after a day or more (when the period of the festival is over ). So it is not as if he worshipped the wooden or earthen object but he has an emotional idea for the time being that God is enthroned in that object. These common people, if questioned, will say &ldquo;God is everywhere, in you, in me and in the wooden image'. The Nrsimhapurāpa 62.5 ( quoted by Aparārka p. 140 on Yāj. I. 101 ) says that sages declare that the worship of Hari (God Viṣnu) may be performed in six ways, yiz, in water, in fire, in one&rsquo;s own heart, in the sun&rsquo;s orb, on an altar or in an image. 1629 The Viṣnudharmotturapurāṇa appears to have been conscious that image worship came later in Kali age and was not prevalent</p>

Tie prosent author saw in several European Churches the images of the Madonna or the images or pictures of certain saints worshipped by Christian people that addressed prayers to the image of the Madonna or the piotures of saints for fulfilment of their desires. Therefore, he thinks that it would not be wrong for him to say that the religion of many Christians in Europe is image worship. 2630 The several darśanas (except that of Cārvāka ) were looked upon generally as approximations to truth. There was no question of all of them being false and one alone as containing the truth.</p>
<p>(XI) Vast Sanskrit literature.</p>
<p>India produced a vast amount of Sanskrit literature of a most varied character for at least three thousand years. There is no country in the world that can exhibit continuous creation of several departments of literature for such a long period. Sanskrit literature penetrated to countries like Tibet, China, Java and others. Its literature influenced the Moslem world and European world by means of the decimal place value system, its fable literature and system of Vedānta. Vide Winternitz&rsquo;s &lsquo;Some problems of Indian Literature ( the Readership Lectures in Calcutta University ) pp. 59–81 for a brief but instructive treatment of the influence of Sanskrit Literature in the West. Its study by Europeans at the end of the 18th century and in the 19th century laid the foundation of several sciences, such as the science of language, of comparative religion, of thought and of mythology. There exist several Histories of Sanskrit Litera ture by several scholars such as Weber, Max Müller, Wintornitz, Keith, M. Krishnamachariar, which will give an idea to any roader of the variety and vastnega of Sanskrit literature.</p>
<ol start="2630">
<li>Vide &lsquo;Hinduism and Baddhisma&rsquo; by Sir Charles Elliot, Vol. I. Iotro. p. LXX, where a similar view is expressed by the learned writer who relies also on William James&rsquo; &lsquo;Varieties of religious experience ? pp. 525–527. Sir Oliver Lodge in Man and the Universe (London, 1908 ) pp. 246-247) says &ldquo;There are plenty of good reasons agaiost idolatry among intellectual and &lsquo;choseo ' people but this (God was jealous of idol worship) is not one of them; nor is it to be supposed that the stock of a tree is ever really worshipped even when prostrated to. An idol, to ignorant and uadeveloped people, is a symbol of something whicu they are really worship piog under a material form and embodiment, the sensuoua presentation assists their infantile efforts towards abstract thonght as material sacramonte help people in a higher stage of religious development; but some of these holps should be outgrown.&rdquo;</li>

<p>Vast Sanskrit Literature</p>
<p>1651</p>
<p>India has preserved for itself and for the world a vast literaturo in the best part of which the principal theme is to ask mon Dover to cease in their efforts to control the senses and to reach higher and higher heights of morality and spirituality. H. H. Gowen in&rsquo; A History of Indian Literature&rsquo; (1931 ) observos (on p. 8) Indian literature has an intrinsic value which no gomoteness avails to destroy. For sacredness, variety and continuity, scarcely any other may compare with it, certainly none surpasses it. As for sacredness no other scripture, not even our Bible, may compete with the Veda in its continuity or in the matter of general acceptance'. He dilates also on the variety and remarkable continuity of Indian literature. Classical Sanskrit first blossoned at least before 500 B.O. Pāṇini names at least ten predecessors and his sūtras IV. 3. 87 and 88 olearly indicate that before his time there was considerable non-vedio secular literature.</p>
<p>XII. Yoga : Yoga has been treated of above (pp. 1385_ 1462). In the whole world there exists hardly any well thought out and comprehensive system of psychical and moral discipline like Yoga. Mercea Eliade observes (on p. 359 ) in.Yoga, Immortality and Freedom' (tç. by Willard R. Trask, 1958)</p>
<p>Yoga constitutes a characteristic dimension of the Indian mind, is marked by reaction against metaphysical speculations and the excesses of a fossilized ritualism'. Western minds having experienced a surfeit of economic prosperity, but worried by the tensions and crises of these times are turning more and more to Yoga and to Indian philosophy such as the Vedānta. In recent years numerous books are being published that deal with * perennial philosophy', Yoga (including Tibetan Yoga ). meditation, concentration, mystical experience &amp;o. Many of these books are written by honest people after reading a good deal of literature on these subjeots but they are wanting in any personal yogio or mystio experience. There are some books that are written by persons who want to take advantage of the popular craze for Yoga and similar mystical practices for the sake of wealth and fame. In &lsquo;Vedanta for the Western World&rsquo;edited by Christopher Isherwood (Allen and Unwin, London, 1948) the famous writer Mr. Aldous Huxley sounds a note of warning against the plethora of books on mysticism and Yoga in the market (p. 376 ).</p>
<p>XIIL Philosophy :</p>
<p>The central point of much of our philosophy is contained in Ohandogyopanigad VI.1, where Uddalaka inquiros of hia conceited</p>
<p>1652</p>
<p>History of Dharmaśāstra [Seo. X, Ch. XXXVI</p>
<p>son Svetaketu &ldquo;Have you asked for that instruction by whioh one hears what cannot be heard, by which one perceives what cannot be perceived, by which one knows what cannot be known;&rsquo; and when Svetaketu asked for that instruction, Uddalaka expounds to him (in VI. 1-16 ) the subject at length and winds up with the words &lsquo;tat-tram-asi&rsquo; (thou art that Se]f). An inquirer into philosophy will find in the various branches of Indian philosophy a vast mass of material, hardly surpassed by any other ancient country in the world. The word for philosophy is darśana and there is a famous work called &lsquo;Sarvadarśangangraba in which fifteen different points of view apart from advaita Vedānta are summarised. The principal orthodox darśanas are six- Sāṅkbya, Yoga, Nyāya, Vaiśeṣika. Pūrvamimāmgā and Uttaramımāmsā&rsquo; (or Vedānta ), which have been treated above and their relation to and influence on Dharmaśāstra has been dwelt upon. The chief marks of Indian philosophy aro that it concentrates on the spiritual, that philosophy has to be lived and not merely discussed, that it seeks the Reality. that for real philosophy great moral preparation is necessary, that reason has to be extensively used in arriving at the truth, that tradition and authority have to be accepted and not neglected. Almost all darśanas ( except that of Cārvāka) are concerned with Liberation ( variously called Mokṣa, Kaivalya, Nirvana, Amptatva Niḥśreyaga, Apavarga) and all (except Cārvāka ) are agreed on the doctrine of Karma and Punarjanna. It is not necessary to say more on Indian Philosopby in this Chapter.</p>
<p>XIV. Arts. Architecture, Sculpture, Painting :</p>
<p>Though the present author has travelled throughout India for over fifty years and seen most of the famous places rich in ancient architecture, sculpture and painting, he lays no claim to being a connoisseur in those matters and cannot gire his own valuation of these relics of ancient Indian Art. The number of works on these is legion. A more bibliography would not be of much use to the reader. Therefore, he will content himself with mentioning a few works on each of the abovo branches which he has road wholly or partly or which he consulted.</p>

<p>Some of the Puranas contain information on the above topics. The Matsyapurāṇa (chap. 25%. 2-4) names 18 ex pounders of Vāstuśāstra (architecture ) such as Bhṛgu, Atri, Vasiṣtha, Viśvakarman, Maya, Nārada, Nagpajit, Viśālākṣa, Purandara, Brahmā, Kumāra, Nandiśa, Saunaka, Garga, Vasudeva, Aniruddha, Sukra and Bṛhaspati. Chapters 253–257 deal with the construction of mansions and houses, chap. 258–263 with images of several deities. The Vāyupurāṇa (8.108 ff.) describes the founding of a capital Agnipuriṇa, chapters 42, 104-106 deal with the building of mansions, houses and laying out cities. The Viṣnudharmottara (third section) is called citrasūtra 2632 because danoing is held to be the primary art and painting rests on it. It is further said that painting is the best of arts (III. 33. 38) and the foremost of auspicious things in &amp; bouge, that the rules that apply to painting are applicable to the making of images of metala, stone and wood (UL 43.31-32). Chapters 36-43 deal with painting, chapters 44-85 with the making of images of gods and goddesses and housebuilding is dilated upon in chap. 86 ff The Bṭhat-samhita ( ed. by M. M.

<p>Puintings - The only famous ancient paintings are those in the caves of Ajanta, in the Bagh oaves in the former Gwalior State and those in the caves at Sigiriya in Ceylon. For reasons of space it is not possible to quote the enthusiastio appreciations of Western writers on ancient Indian Art, particularly paintings and sculpture. The author would quote a few passages from Rene Grousset&rsquo;s 2634 works: &lsquo;India has given a mighty art or &amp; complete Aesthetic equal in originality and power to the Greek and Chinese. It is marked by its naturalism in depicting animals&rsquo;. The same writer says about Ajanta&rsquo;s immortal paintings &lsquo;they count among the most moving that have ever come within human vision&rsquo;. In civilizations of the East&rsquo; (tr. by Mrs. C. A. Phillips, London, 1932 with 249 illustrations) the same author (after citing paintings of the Jātakas of self sacrifice ) remarks these are but a few examples, the most poetic, tender and moving that could be imagined. No better example could be found of that purely Indian sentiment of universal brotherhood, that fervour of humanitarianism which extends even to animals and plants&rsquo; (p. 79). For Ajanta, there is a fine edition by Dr. G. Yazdani, the text in two parts ( 1930 and 1933 ) and there are besides many coloured and monochrome plates with an Introduotion by Lawrence Binyon. There is also another small work prepared for the use of Lord Reading on his visit to Ajanta in 1924 in which Dr. Yazdani gives ten colour plates and one monochrome plate (of a bull fight ) with notes on some of the scenes in several caves and appreciations by Binyon, Rothenstein, Solomon and others. Another good book is my pilgrimage to Ajanta and Bagh' by Sri Mukul Chandra Doy, with Introduction by Lawrence Binyon (London, 1925 )</p>

<p>CHAPTER XXXVII</p>
<p>Future Trends</p>
<p>After the battle of Plassey in 1757 the civil government of the three large provinces of Bengal, Bihar and Orissa came under British rule from 1765. From 1818 when the last Peshwa Bajirao II was defeated and became a pensioner, the British were in control over the whole of India except Punjab, which was subdued in 1845. The British left India in 1947. There fore, they were rulers over a large part of India for 180 years, over the whole of it except Punjab for about 130 years and over Punjab just about 100 years. The impact of British occupation during these periods on Hindu society was tremendous in all spheres, physical, mental and moral. The changes effected during these years of British rule were of such magnitude that they far exceeded the changes that occurred in hundreds of years before the coming of the British. With the advent of British rule came a new system of Government on an all India basis, establishment of courts of justice on Western patterns, laws that applied to all Indians without distinction, modern indivi dualistic liberty, Western pattern of living at least in towns and cities, an educational system placing all Indians on the same level, newspapers, better means of transport, study of modern science, English literature and arts &amp;c.</p>
<p>The present author has no intention of writing anything on the all round changes that have taken place in India under British rule. All that he proposes to do in this chapter is to indicate briefly the effects that are likely to be produced on Hindu society, its ancient ideals and values in the near future, on acoount of science and modern ideas, the Constitution framed for Indian democracy, the idea of a secular State, socialistio pattern of society, economical planning, legislation, growth of population and means to check it.</p>
<p>But before he deals with the above subjects, it is necessary to give a rapid review of the state of things before Independence was achieved. Lord Ripon as Viceroy of India in 1882 started a scheme of local self-government by means of municipal corporations in the cities and district and local Boards in the rural areas. Thus after about 120 years from 1765 when British rule was first established in a large part of India, the British::.</p>

<p>British colonial policy und its effects</p>
<p>165g</p>
<p>thought fit to associate the conquered people in managing some of their own (unimportant and petty) affairs. Colonialism on the part of the British had reached its peak by that time. The British imported raw materials like cotton from India, processed them in Manchester and exported the manufactured products back to India&rsquo;s immense market. At the instance of British manufacturers laws WOTE passed in Britain forbidding the import of Indian silk and cotton goods. India was drained of wealth by that policy for over a hundred years and India became one of tbe poorest countries in the world. Dadabhai Naoroji in his . Poverty and un-British rule in India' (London, 1901, 675 pages) demonstrated this very ably. The main elements of the colonial rule of Britain were these; complete political subjection existed; the main economic activity was in the hands of foreigners, it was foreign capital that was employed in India and substantial dividends or interest on the capital were guaranteed in some cases like the Railways by the British rulers of India payable from the taxes imposed on Indian people, the control of large enterprises was in foreign hands and directed towards securing foreign interests, the land and people were used as instruments of the purposes of Britain. India got peace and political unity at the cost of enormous poverty and distress and many of the economic problems that beset present day India have to be traced back to the disastrous colonial policies of Britain.</p>
<p>The amy of the Government of India was for over a century entirely officered by the British. There were in the 20th century about 7000 officers (lieutenants, captains, majors, colonels ) among whom not one Indian held the King&rsquo;s commission till after the first world war. Then a few were sent every year for training to England. The examination for entry in the Indian civil2635 Service (the &lsquo;Steel frame of the Indian</p>

<p>administration, as one great British Prime Minister was pleased to call it) was held in England (in spite of a Resolution of the House of Commons that the examination for appointment to the Indian Civil Servics in 1893 should be held simultaneously in India and England ). Only a few Indians in the last quarter of the 19th century could go to England and qualify for entry in that heaven-born service. District officers such as Collectors, District Judges, Police Superintendents, Medical officers of the Indian Medical Service ) were almost all British. Almost all Professors in colleges and the head masters of even some secondary schools were Englishmen. All the books to be used in schools were prescribed by the Head of the Department of Public Instruction in the several provinces, all of whom were Westerners. Even primary education was being given only to a small fraction of the children of school-going age, even in 1947 when the British left. The elements of colonial rule by Britain and the policies pursued by the British rulers are emphasized here solely as warnings to present warring elements in our country that if they pursue their quarrels to bitter ends the nation may again be plunged into a miserable state by invasions from powerful and hostile neighbours.</p>
<p>Morley (who was Secretary of State for India and who was believed by many Indians to be a man of liberal or even radical views ) introduced separate communal electorates for Moslems in the reforms of 1909 and he was firmly of opinion that a Parliamentary system in India should not be established in the foreseeable2636 future. It is unnecessary to refer in detail to Montagu&rsquo;s famous speech in 1917, characterizing the Indian Government as too wooden, too antediluvian for modern times, to his statement ( the roverse of Morley&rsquo;s views ) that the policy of the British Government is the gradual development of self governing institutions with a view to the progressive realiza</p>

<li>Vide the volume of &ldquo;Indian Speeches&rdquo; by Viscount Morley (p. 92 ) where he says &quot; If my existence, either officially or corporeally, were prolonged twenty times longer than either of them is likely to be, a Parliamentary system in lodia is not at all the goal to which I would for one moment aspire l'. Even so late as 1941 Sir G. Schuster in &quot; India and - Democracy&rdquo; (MacMillan, 1941 ) strongly expressed the view that Parlia. mentary democracy of the Westminster pattern would not suit India and that Indians would bave to work out a system of their own. He does not eveo indicate bow, while the British ruled India, a democratic system could be evolved by Indians and jo how many years.</li>

<p>Brtish approach to treatment and training of Indians 1661</p>
<p>tion of responsible Government in India as an integral part of the British Empire,' the failure of Dyarchy introduced by Montagu, the Rowlatt Acts, unrest in Punjab, General Dyer&rsquo;s proclamation declaring any assembly of four or more persons as unlawful, his shooting of men, women and children assembled in Jallianwallah Bagh for a meeting in defiance of the procla mation, when, even according to Government statistics, 300 people were killed and 1200 injured, Dyer&rsquo;s compulsory retire ment and the presentation of a purge of thirty thousand pounds to him by his British admirers for saying the British Empire ( as they then thought).</p>
<p>The introduction of education through English was espoused by Lord Macaulay in his &lsquo;Minute on Indian Education&rsquo;. Why he insisted on the education of Indians through English is stated in the Midute as follows: We must at present do our best to form a class who may be interpreters between us and the millions whom we govern; a class of persons Indian in blood and colour, but English in taste, in opinion, in morals and intellect': 2637 English education caused great wastage of effort in learning all subjects (including even Sanskrit) through English and led to a disproportionate pursuit of literary studies and neglect of scientific and technological subjects and created a wide gulf between the educated and the uneducated masses; it glorified Western culture and did not help Indians to study and appreciate their own culture. Educated Indians, particularly in the earlier period of English education in India, came to entertain an exaggerated respect for Western institutions and unduly disparaged their own social and religious systems.</p>
<p>The British Government&rsquo;s interest in Indian education (particularly higher education ) was lukewarm. Three Univer sities (of Bombay, Calcutta and Madras ) were first established in 1857 for the whole of India, but they were merely examining bodies. In the whole of the Bombay Presidency there was no Science Institute entirely maintained by Government till about</p>

<li>An Indian could pass the M. A. examination in Philo sophy without knowing anything about ancient Indian philosophy till only a few years ago. However, English education by Government and missionaries produced a result exactly opposite of what was expected by them. The missiona ries miserably failed in securing the Indians (except a few among the lower castes and ādivāsis ) for Christ and Government found that reading the classics of English literature and works of men like Burke, Spencer, Mill and others created among the educated emotions of nationalism and discontent with their own abject political status. Political agitation daily increased. Lokamanya Tilak was called &lsquo;the father of Indian unrost by an English writer. He passed away in 1920. But his mantle fell on Mahatma Gandbi, who while agitating for political power and eventual freedom, adopted the technique of satyāgraha.</li>

<p>It is not necessary to go into the freedom struggle from 1919 to 19 17 which culminated in the British leaving India but after dividing it into Pakistan and the present India. The partition of India into two parts based on merely communal considerations let loose the most hideous conflicts, massacres and flights of millions of refugees which India had ever witness ed during its long history. The giving up of a large empire with mutual consent and without war or bloodshed is a unique and unparalleled event in the whole history of the world. The message of the King of Great Britain read by Lord Mountbatten as Viceroy to the members of the Constituent Assembly was pobly and graciously worded &quot; With this transfer of power by consent comes the fulfilment of a great democratic ideal to which the British and Indian people alike are firmly dedicated.&rsquo; Dr. Rajendra Prasad&rsquo;s reply to the message of the King was couched in equally noble and just language. While our achieve ment is in no small measure due to our sufferings and sacrifices, it is also the result of world forces and events, and last, though not least, it is the consummation and fulfilment of the historio traditions and democratic ideals of the British race&rdquo; (vide</p>

<p>Constituent Assembly and the Constitution 1663 Parliament and Royal assent was given on 18th July 1947. A Constituent Assembly had been set up by the cabinet mission (of three cabinet ministers, Pethick Lawrence, Secretary of State for India, Stafford Cripps and A. V. Alexander ) and it held its first meeting in December 1946. It re-asgembled in August 1947 as a sovereign body to frame a constitution for free India. Its work went on for over two years and the constitution con sisting of 395 Articles and nine Schedules came into force on 26th January 1950 (except 15 Articles that came into force at once ); vide Art. 394.</p>
<p>The Preamble to the Constitution of India declares that India is a sovereign democratic Republic. The extent of the Indian Republic even at present is vast. It was hardly ever under one Government, except possibly under Asoka. In ancient times India had some ganarājyas or sangharājyas ( oligarchio states, or republics as Jayaswal and some others prefer to call them ). This question of the existence of oligar chies (or republios ) in ancient India has been discussed at some length by the present author in Vol. III pp. 87–96 of the H. of Dh. He still adheres to the views there expressed. The Buddhist monks had a procedure for regulating the meetings of their sangha ( as set out in the Mahāvagga IX. 3 in SBE Vol. XVII p. 264 ff and in Cullavagga IV. 9, SBE Vol. XX pp. 24-27 and pp. 53 ff) and Jayaswal conjectures that the same procedure was followed in oligarchies (or republics ).</p>
<p>There are substantial achievements to the credit of present India and its leaders during the last 14 years after Independence. Some of them may be very succinctly stated here: (1) The production of a comprehensive domooratio constitution guaranteeing freedom of speech and worship, freedom of the Press, protection of the rights of minorities, equality of all before the law, equality of status to women, independent judiciary; (2) Abolition of untouchability (Art. 17 ); (3) poli tioal integration of India without any violence, as the five hundred and odd States (except only three ), that comprised nearly 1/3rd of the total land area of India and 1/4th of the population, patriotioally accepted a merger of the States in the Indian Republic ( Shri, V. P. Menon&rsquo;s &lsquo;Story of the Integration of States&rsquo;); ( 4 ) Reorganization of India into 15 States and six Union Territorios based mostly on linguistic unity and admini strative convenience; (5) holding two elections on the basis of</p>

<p>adult suffrage, viz. every person 26375 (male or female) who is a oitizen of India, is twenty-one years of age and not disqualified under the constitution or any other law, has a right to be registered as a voter at elections to the House of the people and to the Legislative Assemblies of States (Art. 326 ); (6) Socialistic pattern of society as the goal ( Art. 38, 39 ); (7) Two five year plans have been carried out and a third Five Year Plan has been get on foot (under Schedule VII, list III, item 20 ). The creation of a democratic republic was something that India had not been acquainted with for at least twelve centuries (even if gañarājyas were held to be republics and not nerely obligarchies ). From Rgvedic times there was a hereditary monarchical form of rule. Vide Rg. VII. 33.3 and 5, VII. 83. 7-8, where the battle of ton kings ( daśa rājānab) with king Sudās is mentioned; vide also the story of Devāpi and Santanu in Rg. X, 98 expanded in Nirukta II. 10-12.</p>
<p>Some criticism may be offered against the Constitution. In the first place, it is extremely bulky and goes into too many details and is a hotchpotch of provisions from several sources, Some provisions are derived from England, the directive principles of State policy are derived from the constitutions of Ireland and other countries of Europe, some are borrowed from the Government of India Act of 1935. Several of these need not have been put in a Constitution but should have been left to ordinary legislation. In spite of such a lengthy constitution there are many omissions. Nothing is expressly said about political parties, about industrial corporations, about relation of religions and the State. The Constitution makes a complete break with our traditional ideas. Dharmagūtras and Saśtis begin with the dharmas ( duties ) of the people ( varnas and aśramas ). Prime Minister Pandit Nehru himself says in his Azad Memorial Lecturos on &lsquo;India to-day and to-morrow (1959) p. 45 &lsquo;All of us now talk of and demand rights and privileges, but the teaching of the old dharma was about duties and obligations. Rights follow duties discharged.&rsquo; Unfortunately this thought finds no place in the Constitution.</p>
<p>One fact of the greatest importance in the life of India is the accession of the masses to power, not only political, but also</p>
<p>2637 b. Women had no votes in Great Britain till the first war and even now in Switzerland women have do votes ( vida p. 31 of Switzerland in perspective ' by George Soloveytchik (1954).</p>
<p>Common people feel that they have only rights and no duties 1665</p>
<p>social, economical, intellectual and moral. The Constitution engenders a feeling among common people that they have rights and no obligations whatever and that the masses have the right to impose their will and to give the force of law and justice to their own ideas and norms formed in their own cottages and tea shops.</p>
<p>The Constitution of India has no chapter on the duties of the people to the country or to the people as a whole. Art. 19 confers the right to seven freedoms, one of which (c) is to form associations or unions and sub-article ( 4 ) enables the State to make laws imposing, in the interest of public order or morality, reasonable restrictions. The framers of the Constitution forgot to include what Britain had provided long before in 17 and 18 Geo. 5, Chapter 22, Article 1, part of which runs any strike is illegal if it is designed or calculated to coerce the Government directly or by inflicting hardship on the community. The eyes of some of the framers of this constitution were opened by the strike of Government servants in the Railways, Posts and Telegraphs by which, if it had continued for even a fortnight, crores of people would have had to submit to incalculable hard sbips and the action of the strikers in essential services would have been like a rebellion by some lakhs of people against over forty crores of people. The right to strike by workers tacitly given in the constitution is in imitation of similar rights enjoyed in industrial countries like Britain only for the last few decades and the framers should have restricted the right to strikes between private employers and einployees as an experiment</p>
<p>in the first instance.</p>
<p>Another criticism is that there are too many amendments. From 1950 there have been ten amendments, while in the U. S, A, there have been only 22 amendments during a period of about 170 years. The very first amendment was made within less than a year and a half from the day the Constitution came into force. It affeoted about a dozen Articles, among which there were three Articles dealing with fundamental rights viz. 15, 19, 31. One fails to understand the meaning of the words * fundamental rights in a constitution whicb took over two years of deliberations, if they could be changed within a year and a half. The amendment made in Article 31 prohibits a person from challenging in a court of justice a law about the compen sation to be paid to a person for compulsory soquisition of his property. This is a serious inroad on rights to private property</p>

<p>and smacks of spoliation and arbitrariness. In the House of the People the quorum is only 50 and if 50 persons are present and a majority of thom ( say 26 ) decide that a certain amount of compensation should be paid for compulsory acquisition of several properties of a person and the compensation is felt to be ridiculously low he has no remedy in a court of law at all. Besides, the Welfare State is, if at all, foreshadowed in the Directive Principles of State Polioy (Art. 38, 39 etc.), but these principles are not enforceable in a court of law and, therefore, they are inferior to fundamental rights, the breach of which can be examined by the High Court or Supreme Court, which is invested with the power of issuing writs. Parliament (Lokasabba) has over 500 members and the quorum is 50 and yet this small number is not often present and the Speaker has several times to reprimand the House of the People on this score.</p>
<p>Another criticism my be offered as to the inclusion of Universities in list II (of schedule 7, State List, No. 11 ) and not in tha concurrent list. Vocational and technical training of labour is in the concurrent list (Item 25 ). Is not University education throughout India of as much importance as the training of labour? Only items 63-66 (of list I, Union list ) are within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Central Government.2638 There is hardly any weighty reason (except chance ) why the Benares Hindu University, the Aligarh Muslim University, the Delhi University and Santiniketan should be treated as the 6xclusive concern of the Central Government and the other Universities be not placed even in the concurrent list.</p>
<p>The Constitution in its 8th Schedule recognizes fourteen languages as the national languages of India, while Article 343 (1) makes Hindi the official language of the Union, but sub-article 2 ( of Article 343 ) provides that English will continue to be used for all official purposes for fifteen years and sub-article 3 provides that Parliament may continue even after 1965 the use of English for purposes specified by Parliament. Even such a small country as Switzerland has three official languages. The Constitution should have provided at least two Official languages for north India and two for South India, when even</p>

<p>Effect of making Hindi the only official language 1867 in 1950 the population of India was about 36 crores. This sweeping decision to make Hindi the only official language instead of helping emotional integration of Indiang produced great strife. An official language is not the only means of emotional integration, nor even the chief one. The Govt. should begin with the children in the schools, should instil into their minds the fundamental cultural Unity of India, and that India has been looked upon as one by all foreign invaders, steps should be taken to make every Indian feel that he is the inheritor of the vast ancient wisdom and spiritual culture of India, that he must contribute to the conservation of that culture, and must add to its greatness in the future, and free and compulsory education for all children up to the age of 14 should have been achieved in ten years as foreshadowed in Art. 45.</p>
<p>A plan and programme to instil among all grown-up citizens the ideal of national integration must be prepared, insisting on our common past, common interests, common future and on elements like the wisdom and thought embodied in Sanskrit and the regional languages, the tolerance shown by our people through the ages.</p>
<p>The Constitution has also committed several mistakes in the allotment of subjects in the 7th Schedule as Union list, State List and Concurrent list. For example, the production, manu facture, possession, transport, purchase and sale of intoxicating liquors are put in the State List (item 8 in List II, State List) This has led to prohibition in some States, but also its absence in other States.</p>
<p>The above discussion is enough to show that the Constitution framed after more than two years&rsquo; cogitation is unsatisfactory in several ways.</p>
<p>Ours is a democratic Republic. The most famous definition of democracy is Lincoln&rsquo;s viz. &lsquo;Government of the people by the people for the people&rsquo;. All three must exist in a proper democracy. In the Greek city States such as Athens all adult citizens ( exoept. slaves that outnumbered citizens ) could assemble and could directly participate in discussion and the framing of laws and regulations. But this is impossible when orores of people spread over a vast country are voters. Therefore, one part of Lincola&rsquo;s definition becomes watered down. Crores of people cannot govern themselves, which is a physical impossibility. All they can do is to choose some men as their rulers. In former ages when monarchy</p>
<p>1668</p>
<p>History of Dharmaśāstra [Seo. X, Ch. XXXVII</p>
<p>was the prevailing form the ruler came to be ao by succession or by conquest i. e. by breaking heads. Now, under democracy, the ruler or rulers are chosen by the more counting of heads. As observed by Dr. Radhakrishnan in &lsquo;Kalkin or the future of civilization&rsquo; ( 4th ed. of 1956 ) Democracy in actual working rarely permits a country to be governed by its ablest. The opinions of the mass provail over those of the thinking few. We must strive for some better way for conducting human affairs than the lottery of the ballot-box' (pp. 20-22). René Guonon in &lsquo;Crisis of the modern world&rsquo; (translated by Arthur Osborne, London, 1932 ) romarks the law is supposed to be made by the opinion of the majority, but what is overlooked is that this opinion is something that can very easily be guided or modified i. e. opinion can be manufactured. The majority on whatever question it may be called on to give its opinion is always composed of the incompetent, whose number is vastly greater than that of the men who can give an opinion based on a full knowledge of the subject' (p. 108 ).</p>
<p>These words of René Guenon refer to conditions in European countries in most of which there has been almost cont per cent literacy for goine decades. Parliamentary democracy assumes that voters understand the policies and programmes of different parties and cast their votes accordingly, It presupposes some education, intelligence, respect for the rule of law, tolerance, a sense of brotherhood for at least one&rsquo;s countrymen, and a more or loss homogeneous society. But when, as in India at present, the vast majority of voters are illiterate, the state of things becomes far worse. We can and must tolerate democracy in India as a first step towards better days, though at present it is a mere shell and is ridiculed by some unsympathetic foreigners.2639 The census of 1961 discloses that literacy which was only 16.6 percent in 1951 is 23.7 percent in 1961. Dean Inge in</p>

<p>to his friends and associates. In our country also ministers and officials must be in &amp; similar predicament, particularly when there exist numerous rules and regulations about permits and licenses galore.</p>
<p>The Directive Principles of state policy are contained in Articles 37 to 51 and it is provided in Article 37 that they shall not be enforceable by any court, but that they are fundamental in the governance of the country. Article 45 enacts that the State shall endeavour to provide within a period of ten years from the commencement of this constitution for free and compulsory education for all children until they complete the age of fourteen years. It is more than twelve years since the commencement of the Constitution. In spite of the fact that about 7000 crores of rupees were to be spent on grandiose schemes in the two Five Year Plans, this fundamental provision was not implemented. Even free and compulsory primary education of all children up to the age of eleven years ( instead of 14 as envisaged in Artiole 45 ) is not accomplished and it is promised that in the Third Five Year Plan (which envisages an expenditure of over ten thousand crores of rupees ) this may be accomplished. But, if the huge sums for the third plan be not forthcoming, the first casualty will be education. The education of the masses who are to be voters and indirectly rulers of the nation continues to be sadly neglected even after Independence.</p>
<p>It is remarkable that the directive principles of state polioy mostly contain provisions on the economic system for raising people&rsquo;s standard of living (Art. 43, 47 &amp;o.), i. e. it lays emphasis only on the material things for the people. It seems to be assumed that if material prosperity or benefits are assured for all, then there is nothing more to be done by the State. The present author feels that the Directive Principles should also have put equal or greater emphasis on moral and spiritual values and should have called upon the State to promote among the people high moral standards, self-discipline, 00-operation, sense of responsibility, kindliness, high endeavour. Man is a many-sided being. The satisfaction of more physical needs is not enough. Man has intellectual, spiritual, cultural and social aspirations also. The socio-economic pattern for the future must be based on the foundation of the best part of our traditions, the rule of dharma, the duties common to all as declared by Manu X, 63 and Yaj. I. 122. A secular state should not and does not mean a godless state or a state that has nothing to do with moral and</p>
<p>1670</p>
<p>History of Dharmaśāstra (Sec. X, Ch. XXXVII</p>
<p>spiritual values. Prime Minister Nehru himself emphasizes this, when he sayg' whether religion is necessary or not, a certain faith in a worth-while ileal is essential to give substance to our lives and to hold us together. We have to have a sense of purpose beyond the material and physical demands of our daily lives' ( in &lsquo;Today and tomorrow&rsquo;p. 81. It may be stated that for most common men and women it is religion that sets worth-while ideals.</p>
<p>The third item in Lincoln&rsquo;s definition is for the people&rsquo;. That is, the Government inust look to the good of the people as a whole and not to that of any class or a community in the country. Modern democracy has conie to mean parties and it has to work on dacisions of the majority. It often happens that, there being several parties, no one party has an absolute majority over all other parties put together, It may often happen that one party secures 40% of the votes actually cast and the other parties (that differ in ideologies) secure, say 25, 20, 15, percent of the votes, then the first party with only 40 percent of the total votes cast rulee, though it does not represent the majority of the whole country. The party system generally leads to a struggle for power and lowers the moral standards of the whole people, particularly when hardly one-fifth of the voters (both male and female ) can read and write their own regional language. The present author does not hold that illiteracy necessarily means absence of intelligence. But, unless a 182 can read for himself and ponder over what he reads, he can hardly be a good judge of the pros and cons in relation to a measure or policy placed before the voters. Besides, the emphasis laid on standards of living without any direct reference to moral and spiritual values has already led to this result that in India the desire for material comforts and positions of power dominates almost every one and there is no corresponding urge or even idea to do one&rsquo;s best for producing goods. The laws are drafted in the English language. Most of the speakers in Parliament use English (a few only speak in Hindi ) and complicated laws are gaid to have been passed by a majority or unanimously as the case may be. That country may be said to be the best governed which is least governed. There is a spate of legislation in the House of the People. In the seven years from 1950 to 56 nearly 450 laws were passed by the central legislature alone. Some of these laws vitally affect Hindus in their family relations and in other respects. A few examples only can be cited here. The Hindu Adoption Act went far beyond the ancient Hindu principles, which were two viz. that</p>
<p>Spate of legislation in India</p>
<p>1671</p>
<p>only a male could be adopted for purposes of spiritual benefit to the adopter and the person to be adopted should be in age and other matters like a son. Women could not adopt to thomselves but a widow could adopt a son for the spiritual benefit of her husband. These principles have been thrown to the winds as will be seen from the criticisms of the present author above on pp. 1337-1338. But one thing must be mentioned. In some enactments affecting Hindu Law, customs have been abrogated: vide Hindu Marriage Act 25 of 1955, Section 4, Hindu Succession Act 30 of 1956, Section 4 (1). The Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act ( 78 of 1956 ) prescribes that the person to be adopted must not be more than 15 years of age ( section 10 item IV) and that there should be a difference of 21 years between a male adopter and a female adoptee and between a female adopter and a male adoptee (geo. 11 items iii and iv). But the provision in Sec. 10 is made subject to a custom to the contrary. It passes one&rsquo;s understanding why custom was allowed to prevail over the law in this case. The Hindu Marriage Act, 25 of 1955, has made sweeping changes of which the vast majority of Hindus are blissfully ignorant. Before the Act a Hindu could in theory (and rarely in practice ) have two or more wives living at the same time and even an anuloma marriage (i, e, the marriage of a male of a higher varṇa with a woman born in a lower varna ) was held to be invalid by some High Courts in India such as those of Allahabad and Madras. Now under the present Hindu Marriage Act of 1955 the marriage is a monogamous marriage ( section 5) and a person belonging to any casta may marry a woman of any caste how highsover or lowsoever she may be by caste; and further marriages between spouses belonging to the Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist or Jaina religions are now declared valid. It was suggested, while the marriage Bill was in the Committee stage, that the provision as to monogamous marriages should become compulsory when a similar provision would be made applicable to Muslims ( who under the Koradic law can have four wives at the same time ). But this was brushed aside through fear of antagonizing Muslims. Other provisions about Buddhists, Jains and Sikhs being Hindus for the purposes of the Marriage Act, being a sweeping one at one stroke, is likely to be resented by almost all illiterate Hindus and likely to lead to tension and bitterness in many rural families and to break-up of the family as a central and compact unit in Hindu society. The orthodox people do not like such mixed marriages. It is not</p>
<p>and a 1955 the Ladrag</p>
<p>1672</p>
<p>History of Dharmatāstra 1 Sec. X, Ch. XXXVII</p>
<p>unlikely that the orthodox sections in the country may join hands with the ignorant masses and set back the hands of the clock, when some years hence the ranks of the towering personalities of the Gandhi era whom people want to humour have become thin.2640</p>
<p>One of the outstanding characteristics of Hindu society for several millennia has been the joint family system of the Mitākṣarā type which prevails in the whole of India (except in Bengal which is under the Dāyabhāga system ). Ita peculiarity is that all male members in the family form a coparcenary, that if any male of the family dies his interest devolves by survivor. ship on the remaining male members including his own male issue, if any, that females have no rights in the family property except marriage expenses and maintenance and no member of the joint family could transfer any part of the family property by will(not even the father) or by sale or mortgage except for certain recognised family necessities. This joint family system and the caste system wers the bulwarks that kept together Hindu Society for centuries, inspite of foreign invasiobs and misrule. The Hindu Succession Act ( 30 of 1956 ) makes two sweeping changes in the Mitākṣarā joint family system. The explanation to Section 30 of the Act provides that any male Hindu may dispose of by will his interest in the coparcenary property. This is one drastic change. A similar drastic change was made by section 6, its proviso and explanation read together. Briefly it comes to this. If a Hindu coparconor of the Mitākṣarā system dies after the Succession Act comes into force, leaving him surviving no son, but a daughter or the danghter of a predeceased son or the son of a pro deceased daughter or daughter of &amp; predeceased daughter, his interest in the coparcopary property will not pass by survivor ship to the other surviving male members of the coparoenary but to the above mentioned descendants of his and the interest that would pass to these descendants would be the share in the coparcenary property that would have been allotted to him if partition of the coparcenary property had taken place immediately before his death. Before this Act, the daughter or the other hoirs mentioned above would have got nothing in the coparcenary property when any male member of the family died sonless. These two changes make of the joint family of the Mitākṣarā</p>

<p>Far-reaching changes in Hindu Law</p>
<p>1673</p>
<p>type a mere shell. It was suggested when the Bill was before Parliament that Parliament should provide that the joint family system of the Mitākṣarā type has been abrogated and that all members of the joint family after the passing of the Act would be only tenants-in-common. But this was not done. Why the Minister in charge or the members of Parliament felt squeamish about ending the copercenary system of the Mitākṣarā is not clear to the present author. It looks like straining at a goat while swallowing a camel. These and other changes in the old Hindu Law are possibly motivated by the desire to do justice to the rights of women. But in some cases this is done with a vengeance. For reasons of space only one example of this type is cited. Under Section 8 of the Hindu Succession Act and the Schedule of heirs in class I and class II, if a man dies possessed of property leaving only his mother and father (and no sons or wife or other persons ) the mother will take the whole estate of her son absolutely to the entire exclusion of the father, since the mother is placed among heirs of class I., while the father is placed in class II and the rule in Sec. 8 (a and b) is that heirs put in class II succeed only if there is no heir in class I. Under Yaj. II, 135 the order of heirs to a man dying without male issue is first the widow, then daughter, then daughter&rsquo;s son or sons, then parents (piturau, the dual is used). Some commentators held that the mother is to be preferred as hoir to the father, others held that the father is to be preferred to the mother, while still others held that both parents ahould succeed together. In the Council of States (Rajyasabha) the father was put in class I along with the mother, but in the House of the People the mother was put in class I and the father was put as heir in class II. Artiole 15 of the Constitution prohibits discrimination on the ground of sex, religion, race &amp;o. What difference can be made between the mother and the father of a man as heirs except on the ground of sex? Probably, the legislators wanted, in however small a way, to compensate women for past injustices to them. The Hindu Law of Succession of 1956 goes even beyond Muslim Law in that it recognizes twelve categories of persons (in class I of Schedule) &amp;s entitled to succeed simultaneously and take the property of the deceased. In a few Cages it is possible that the heirs of class I taking the estate of a deceased person may be twenty or even more, if the latter leaves five sons and five daughters, besides some children of predeceased sons and daughters. There is probably no country in the world where so many persons are entitled to succeed simultaneously to</p>
<p>E, D. 210</p>
<p>1674</p>
<p>History of Dharmaśāstra (Soo. X, Ch. XXXVII</p>
<p>&amp; deceased person&rsquo;s estate. The result would be that thore would be great fragmentation of property and constant wrangles and litigation. This amounts to distribution of poverty. Under the Hindu Law before 1955 women as heirs to males took as a general rule a limited estate ( i. e. a life estate ). For example, if a man died leaving his wife and a brother or a brother&rsquo;s son (but no children ) his widow would take a limited estate i. e. on the widow&rsquo;s death, the estate would go to the brother (if alive ) or to the latter&rsquo;s sons &amp;c. Now (after 1956 ) the widow would take an absolute estate and she would be able to dispose of it as she pleased ( by sale, gift or will ). Vide Section 14 of the Hindu Succession Act of 1956. Not only this, that section has retrospectively conferred an absolute estate on the widows who succeeded as limited owners before 1956. Suppose a person died in 1950, leaving a widow and a brother. The widow would take only a limited estate and she could not sell it or will it away; if she died before 1956 the husband&rsquo;s brother would have succeeded to the estate. But suppose she is alive and in possession of her husband&rsquo;s estate when the Act of 1956 was passed. Her estate is at once enlarged. She can donate it to any one or leave it by her will to her own brother and entirely destroy the expectancy of the husband&rsquo;s brother to succeed to her husband&rsquo;s estate. This is equality of women with a vengeance The mass of people know nothing about this at present. But when many cases come before the courts and the common people come to know the present law whereby the expectancies of male members of Ler husband&rsquo;s family are set at Daught by the widow transferring the property to persons that are strangers there is bound to be great trouble. Of all the revolutionary changes in India none will have more pervading influence and meaning than the drastic changes in the legal status of women made by the laws affecting Hindus passed from 1954 to 1956, which enforce monogamy, make polygamy punishable, which provide the minimum ages for the marriage of women and men at 15 and 18 respectively, which allow divorce to both sexes on the same basic rules, which confer rights of inheritance and absolute ownership on a daughter and her children, that allow the husband or the widow of a person, if the deceased had not already adopted a son and a daughter before his death, to adopt a son and a daughter.</p>

This is felt by common people as a great injustice, when there is no ceiling on the wealth of big merchants and the like. It may be argued that these very rich people pay income-tax and other taxes. The agriculturists also say that they pay taxes and that inflation has made the price of bare necessities go up.</p>
<p>Before leaving the subject of legislation vitally affecting Hindu society, some remarks will have to be made about the mentality of several Congressmen who appear to have great faith in making mep moral by legislation. Article 47 provides that it is among the primary duties of the State to raise the level of nutrition, the standard of living of its people and the improvement of public health and that, in particular, the State shall endeavour to bring about prohibition of the consump tion of intoxicating drinks and of druge which are injurious to health. The Bombay State and a few other States in India embarked on a policy of total prohibition of intoxicating drinks. If there was to be a total prohibition of intoxicating drinks, it should have been an all India measure. Several States refused to have the prohibition law because there is loss of revenue in two ways, viz, the income from excise duties on liquors is lost and large sums of money bave to be spent on establishments for preventing people from manufacturing illicit liquor. Art. 45 about free and compulsory education of children of school-going age (up to 14 years) was not strenuously observed by the Bombay State but it wanted to enforce Art. 47 at all costa. Besides, there being no prohibition on an all India basis, what is an offence under law in the Bombay State is not an offence in Delhi and some other States at all. That takes away the moral basis from the measure. Besides, prohibitionists forget human psychology. When something is prohibited or becomes rare, many feel a fascination in breaking the law or trying to possess what is rare. Illicit liquor produced and kept under the most unhygienio conditions is being sold on a large scale and persons knowing this dare not inform the police for fear of being stabbed or killed by distillers of illicit liquor,2640a A -</p>

<p>Minister&rsquo;s cook was found engaged in manufacturing illicit liquor. In the present author&rsquo;s opinion probibition has turned out to be a dismal failure, it tends to corrupt the police, it reduces revenue much needed for development purposes, illicit distillation has become a cottage industry and boot-leggers have acquired &amp; vested interst in prohibition. Why horse-racing and betting are not probibited by law is inexplicable, except on the supposition that many people entertain that Government is afraid of displeasing rich people who indulge in it. Wine and gambling have beep besetting sins from the times of the Rgveda. Vasiṣtha pleads for forgiveness of sins from Varuṇa in Rgvoda VII. 86.6 saying that it is not one&rsquo;s own power that leads one to commit sin, it is fate, wine, anger, dice (gambling) and thoughtlessness'. In Rg. X. 34 a gambler laments over his own frailty. Therefore, all that can be reasonably attempted is temperance and reducing the spread of the drinking habit; otherwise new and greater evils pot contemplated in the ardour for suppression emerge. Vide p. 1338 above for the warning given against startling changes based on Mr. Aldous Huxley&rsquo;s words. Another faddist attempt at improving morals by legislation is the recent Act prohibiting dowries, which came into force on first July 1961. The giving or taking or abetting the giving or taking of dowry or demanding a dowry directly or indirectly from the parents or guardians of a bride or bridegroom is punishable with imprisonment extending to six months or with fine extending to five thousand rupees or with both. The definition of dowry punishable 2611 under the act is rendered practically nugatory by the explanation that presents made at the time of a marriage to either party to the marriage in the form of cash, ornaments, clothes or other articles, shall not be deemed to be dowry within the meaning of the section, unless they are made as consideration for the marriage of the said parties. This, instead of relieving the parents of marriageable girls from the payment of a dowry, would give rise to blackmail on the part of busy bodies in the town or the village of the parties. If this lattor does not happen the Act will ordinarily remain a dead letter.</p>

<p>Śtarting of Village Panchayats 1674 Article 40 of the Constitution calls upon the State to organize village Panchayats and to endow them with the power! and authority necessary to enable them to function as units of self-government. In ancient and medieval times, village Panchayats played an important part. Under the British this system ( which trained people in democratic functions on a small scale ) was practically done away with. Now after about two hundred years the present Government wants to revive Panchayats. In the different States of India village Panchayat Acts have been passed. Until a large percentage of villagers become educated, self-reliant and men of character, the village Panchayats cannot function as the foundations of real democracy. It is very likely that either the dominant castes or the leading families or the bullies (gundas) in the village will capture the village Panchayats and use them for their own benefit A recent book &lsquo;Panchayt-i-raj&rsquo; by Shri 8. A. Dey (published by Asia Publishiug House, 1961 ) paints a very roseate picture of Panchayats functioning in the 550 thousand villages of India. It all depends on disinterested workers of high character; other wise this project will meet the same fate that overtook Brayne&rsquo;s work in Gurgaon after Brayne left.</p>
<p>Some people took it into their heads to decide that agri. cultural land should belong to him who tilled it. Therefore, in Bombay and some other States legislation was enacted, first holding that he who tillod another&rsquo;s land for six years was to be regarded as a &lsquo;protected tenant&rsquo; (i, e. practically &amp; permanent tenant); later on the owner was prohibited from selling the land to a non-agriculturist and ultimately( by Bombay Act. LXVII of 1948, 860.32 ) the tenant was made the owner, being liable to pay to the original owner the price fixed by the Revenue authorities spread over twelve yearly instalments. Whatever may be the case in Zamindaris, in the Deccan and some South Indian States the Ryofwari system prevails and persons belonging to the lower middle class purchased lands at high prices (not getting more than three or four percent as ront on the money invested ) as land was deemed a stable investment. The present author, having been a practising lawyer for forty-five years, knows personally thousands of village people. In many cases although four or five years have passed away, the Revenue authorities have not yet decided the prices of the lands over which ownership of erstwhile tenants has been declared. Most of the erstwhile tonants ( now become owners ) have not paid a pie for four years</p>

<p>and the real owners have been robbed of the benefit to be derived from the price, if paid. Supposing Government was solioitous of increasing production by making tenants owners there is no reason why Government should not have recovered the price or instalments as a revenue demand. There is no judicial probe in the ordinary courts of law, the appeal lies only to the Govt.(that means to the Collector), no owner is entitled to engage a pleader ( sec. 80 A) and very complicated provisions are made if the former tenant fails to pay each instalmont. But the present state of things is sheer spoliation and looks like robbing Peter to pay Paul and is a sample of what democracy might mean to people of the lower middle class. There is no evidence that by these measures production of food grains has greatly increased. But Congressmen are complacent because they know that in the elections the vast majority of illiterate agriculturists who are to benefit by such legislation will cast their votes in favour of &lsquo;ozen&rsquo; adopted as symbol by the Congress party. Many States have introduced by legislation ceilings in land holdings, viz. no man or family is to hold more then 48 acres of dry land and no more than 24 acres of irrigated land. Even agriculturists have Dow begun to grumble and to ask why no ceilings are placed on the accumulation of wealth, when they see rich paople flaunting their wealth in cars eighteen or twenty feet in length, obstructing narrow roads and causing serious casualties. 2612 Most people complain that the poor are getting poorer and the rich richer under the policies of the present Government. Government is not able to hold the price line and agriculturists, workers in industries and the lower middle class are dissatisfied and there is great danger of communistic ideas spreading among the majority of the inhabitants of this ancient land, that once honoured sages. Prime Minister Neliru said on the Congress manifesto for the elections of 1962 2643 &lsquo;If the great majority of people in India for some reason or other become communists in the sense of thinking that way, it may be good or bad, I do not know, but I</p>

I do not want that to happen, even though I want India to take up modern scientific techniques, scientific theories, economic theories, economic organizations. I accept all that to the extent it is good for India. It is for us to choose, I do not rule out any-thing but I rule out being uprooted from India',</p>
<p>What is ordinarily mont by &lsquo;Socialism&rsquo; is collective farming, the abolition of the private ownership of the means of production and State Industrialization. Merely saying that the land should go to the tiller and carrying out that by legislation is simply robbing one person to benefit another. It is a long way off from that to socialist farming which would make the tiller a landlegs worker on the collective farm.</p>
<p>It is often said that ours is a' Welfare State and that what is aimed at is a socialistic pattern of society'. The Constitution does not employ thege very words. But Art. 38 appears in substance to mean that India would be a Welfare State, as it provides The State shall strive to promote the welfare of the people by securing and proteoting as effectively as it may a social order in which justice, social, economic, political, shall inform all the institutions of the national life.' In the report of the Planning Commission on the 2nd Five Year Plan (which was acoopted by the Government ) the meaning of &lsquo;socialistic pattern of society is set out as follows : 2644</p>
<p>The task before an underdeveloped country is not merely to get better results within the existing framework of economic and social institutions, but to mould and refashion these so that they contribute effectively to the realisation of wider and deeper social values. These values or basic objectives have recently been summed up in the phrase &ldquo;socialist pattern of society&rsquo;. Essentially this means that the basic criterion for determining the lines of advance must not be private profit, but social gain and that the pattern of development and the structure of socio economio relation should be so planned that they result not only in appreciable increase of national income and employment but also in greater equality in incomes and wealth.' Major decisions regarding production, distribution, consumption and investment</p>

<p>must be made by agencies informed by social purpose. The benefits of economic development must accrue more and more to the relatively less privileged classes of society and there should be progressive reduction of the concentration of incomes, wealth and economic power. The problem is to create a milieu in which the small man who has so far had little opportunity of perceiving and participating in the immense possibilities of growth through organized effort is enabled to put in his best in the interest of a higher standard of life for himself and increased prosperity for the country'. It appears from this and from what follows that &lsquo;socialist pattern of society&rsquo; is not to be regarded as some rigid or fixed pattern. It is not rooted in any doctrine or dogma.</p>
<p>A booklet published by Sriman Narayan for the All India Congress Committee (2nd ed. of 1956, New Delhi) embodies the notable speeches of the Prime Minister Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru. He starts by saying that private enterprise is useful so far as our country is concerned, that we wish to encourage it, but the dominance which privato enterprise had throughout the world during a certain period is no more and that for a planner it has now a secondary place. Later on (p. 2 ) he states that he uses the word ' socialistic picture of society' as meaning largely that the means of production should be sociully owned or controlled for the benefit of society as a whole. On p. 12 he says ( at Avadi Session )&lsquo;we bave laid down that certain basio industries must necessarily be state-owned and there are other industries we should try to encourage the State to start. The plan is an integrated whole and in that integrated whole the public and private sector inust also be integrated. They are not rival shows.&rsquo; On p. 19 he saya. The national aim is a welfare state and a socialistic economy.' &lsquo;Finance is important, but not 80 much as people think.&rsquo;. What is important is trained personnel. The only thing we have to guard against is inflation. Inflation is avoided if there is production corresponding to the money thrown in'. (p. 20 ). &ldquo;Everyone in the country should have the primary things of life like food, clothing, housing, education, sanitation, medical help, employment, work' (p. 27). &ldquo;The objectives of India&rsquo;s Planning should be socialistic pattern of society. It cannot be achieved by mere legislation; but it is all a question of planning' (pp. 30-31 ). Both Congress and Parliament have said that we want a socialistic pattern of society. Why have we used this vague languageWe have done</p>
<p>Vague language about Socialistic pattern</p>
<p>1681</p>
<p>so deliberately because we do not want to commit ourselves to any rigid formula' (p. 55). &lsquo;India wants a social revolution by peaceful means, peaceful methods, by mutual agreement, by working together. Hard work is the only way to progress.&rsquo; Russia had to use force to do in 20 or 25 years what England did in 1.00 years ( pp. 60-66 ).</p>
<p>These quotations taken from the speeches of the Prime Minister clearly establish that he does not want a totalitarian communiam in India. He appears to favour a democratic socialistic pattern. But he himself admits that vagus language about socialistic pattern has been deliberately used and that his idea is to build up in India by trial and error a sort of democratic socialism. But there is great danger in this. The present author is not aware of any large country in the world where a democratic socialistic pattern purposely clothed in vague language has been tried and gucceeded. The language being vague and no defininite procedure being chalked out, a socialistic pattern would mean all things to all men and the socialistic pattern of society is vague enough to allow diverse interpretations,</p>
<p>Russia and China have been and are under totalitarian socialism. In Soviet Russia under Lenia and Stalin peasants, working men and intellectuals became statesmen and military commanders, the old economic principle of supply and demand was replaced by central control of all commercial relations, of all production and distribution among the large populations of Russia spread over vast areas, individualistio agriculture gave place to hugo co-operative farms managed under the directivos of the State, aristocracy and democracy were abolished and dictatorship of a party that monopolized all power emerged. Our leaders appear to have borrowed the ideas of co-operative farming and the State control of production and distribution of several commodities from the Russian example, but the present writer is afraid that without the coercive methods employed by dictators like Stalin, our experiments will not in a measurable period of time lead to the results desired and expected by our · leaders.</p>
<p>Those interested in democratio socialism may profitably read Shri Ashok Mehta&rsquo;s work on it (published by Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, 1959).</p>
<p>A, D. 211</p>
<p>1682</p>
<p>History of Dharmasastra [800. X, Oh. XXXVII</p>
<p>What appears to the present author is that our country is to have a mixed economy, in which private and publio enterprise are supposed to work together to narrow the disparity or gulf between a small minority of haves and a vast multitude of have-nots. For example, Atomic energy, Railways, iron and steel, aircraft, ship-building are among Government industries, while the private sector is to be concerned with the manufacture of textiles, cement, alluminium, machine tools, chemicals and pharmaceuticals &amp;o.</p>
<p>The present writer doos not think that he is competent enough to criticize the means and methods that are being adopted by the leaders of the country and to say whether they are enough to meet the high promises made and the hopes raised by certain Articles in the Constitution such as 39 ( part a of which declares that the citizens have the right to an adequate means of livelihood ), 41 (providing for securing the right to work, to education and to public assistance in cases of un-empluy ment, old age, sickness and disablement), 43 (the State shall endeavour to secure to all workers, agricultural, industrial or otherwise, work, a living wage, decent standard of life and full enjoyment of leisure and social and cultural opportunities ); vide Articles 45 and 47 already quoted above (on pp. 1669, 1675)</p>
<p>But he will say a few words. The mass of people cannot be kept at a high level of self-sacrifice, great ideals and hard work for long. A dynamic and revered leader like Buddha may succeed for a time in securing this. But, when he passes away, there is gradually a relapse into conditions worse than what they were before. For the vast majority of people anywhere private gain is the chief motive for hard work and not mere requests or sermons. If that motive is abolished, then the majority will not work hard at all, though a few individuals of high ideals and moral character may work as hard as before. Or there will have to be a dictatorship, coercion and fear of being liquidated. In the absence of these, production will be enormously reduced and there will be no improvement in standards of living. Russia and China are not under a Parlia mentary democracy and they can therefore make people work without trammels, but in countries like U. K., U. 8. A., even Japan the appeal of the motive of private gain is the chief factor. Even in Russia incentives have to be held out for extra work and it is admitted that even after forty years of totalitarian rule, there are great-inequalities of income, since the wages of</p>
<p>Inequalities of income in Ü. 8. 8. R.</p>
<p>168$</p>
<p>an Academician and an average worker are in the ratio of 62:1, and ( apart from aoademicians) the wages of high-placed executives and common men are in the ratio of 20:1 and there are no ceilings on income. 2646 Shri Vinoba Bhave placed his target about Bhūmidana at fifty million acres but he got only about five million acres, half of which are not arable. Now the emphasis has shifted to &ldquo;Sarvodaya'. Shri Jayaprakash Narayan, who was first a Marxist out and out, then joined the P. S. Party, is now advocating the principles of Sarvodaya' in 2647 * Towards a new society' published by Mr. Prabhakar Padhye for the Congress for cultural freedom (New Delhi, 1958). Sarvodaya planning seems to be based on the assumption that a radical change in human behaviour and attitude to work and property will take place on a large scale without coercion. There is hardly any basis for any such assumption at present. The Prime Minister himself adaits (vide p. 240 of Prof. V. K. R. V. Rao&rsquo;s paper in Changing India &lsquo;) that adequate motives and inducements have to be provided. The Indian Government more than any other purely democratic country in the world has extended the scope of public administration to embark on the production and distribution of economic goods while keeping at the same time full Parliamentary democracy. Gandhiji also called upon the millionaires to hold their vast fortunes in trusteeship. One should like to know the names of even a dozen millionaires in India that dealt with their wealth like trustees even in Gandhiji&rsquo;s lifetime.</p>

<p>2648, Third Five Year Plan'. published by the Government of India, Plaoning Commission, 1961 ( 774 pages). While these pages were passing through the press the author came across a book called &lsquo;Planning in India by Mr. V, T. Krishnamachari ( Orient Loogmans, 1961 ) who was a member of the Planning Commission from March 1950 and Deputy Chairman from February 1953 to June 1960. It is a valuable book based on official in formation and containing numerous tables and details. It requires to be carefully studied and invites criticism, but that cannot be done in this place now.</p>
<p>1684</p>
<p>History of Dharmadāstra (sec. X, CL, XXXVII</p>
<p>objectives of the planners are stated on L. d. &lsquo;Rapid economic growth and expansion of employment, reduction of disparities in income and wealth, prevention of the concentration of economic power, and creation of the values and attitudes of a free and equal society. Where the bulk of the people live so close to the margin of poverty, the claims of social justice, the right to work, of equal opportunity and of a minimum level of living have great urgency&rsquo;. On p. 48 the principal aims are further elabora ted and it is stated on p. 49 that the first priority belongs to agriculture and therefore the total outlay provided is 1718 crores of rupees as against 950 crores in the Second Plan and fertilizers to the extent of 800,000 tons are provided for as against 110,000 tons in the 2nd Plan.</p>
<p>Our country&rsquo;s great handicap is population and food produc tion. Statistics for the growth of population 2619 are (in millions ): 1901 (235.5), 1911 ( 249 ), 1921 ( 248.1), 1931 ( 275.5), 1941 ( 314.8), 1951 (356.9), 1961 ( 138 ). This indicates that by about 1966-1967 the population of our country may be about 480 millions. Article 39a ( referred to on p. 1666 ) requires the State to direct its policy towards securing that every citizen has the right to an adequate means of livelihood. Our country has been an agricultural country from time immemorial, yet we have to import millions of tons of wheat and other grain for feeding our large population. The finance minister in his speech on the Budget for 1961-62 states (p. 79 para 36 ) that in May 1961 an agreement under P. L. 480 was signed by Ivdia&rsquo;s minister with the U. S. A. for the import in four years of 18 million tons of wheat, oda million tons of rice and also certain quantities of maize, cotton, tobacco and soya bean oil. This is the biggest agricultural commodities agreement ever signed between two countries. There were four previous agreements commenoing f:om August 1956 but they were all on a legger scale. The fifth agreement of May 1960 was for agricultural commodities worth 1369,8 million dollars ( = 655.8 crores of rupees ). The average intake of food in India is below the nutritional standards laid down by scientists. Ours is one of the poorest countries in the world as the following table 2650 for national income per capita for 1957 will show :</p>

<p>These figures show that in Ceylon the per capita income is double that of India, in Japan it is four times as much and in Germany over twelve times that of India. Both Germany and Japan were devastated by the 2nd World War and yet the people of both countries have in less than 15 years improved so much in production that both are giving substantial assistance to India. Our people and leaders should deeply ponder over this state of things and should strain every nerve in an all out effort to improve the country&rsquo;s lot instead of talking and mutual biokerings.</p>
<p>While these pages were passing through the Press, the author got a copy of India &rsquo;s Food Crisis and steps to meet it&rdquo; which is a report (of 254 pages) made in 1959 by a Ford Foundation Team of thirteen American Technicians and agriculturist specialists at the invitation of two Indian Mini stors of Food and Agriculture and Community Development and co-operation. It is &amp; very important document, discusses seventy. aspects of the problem and deserves close study by all Indians interested in India&rsquo;s welfare. It is issued by the Goʻrt. of India. One or two striking matters can alone be referred to here. The report points out that the total population of India will be about 480 millions at the end of the Third Five Plan in 1966, that the target of 110 million tons of food grains by 1965-66 is reasona ble and is necessary to provide food enough for the added millions and to provide for some dietary improvement and a safety margin for poor crops and other emergencies. The report recognises that India is making steady progress in food produc tion, but the rate of production must be tripled to meet the Third Plan target. It gives the warning that if India&rsquo;s food production increases no faster than at present rates, the gap</p>
<p>1686</p>
<p>History of Dharmatūstru 1 sec. X, Ch. XXXVII between supplies and target will be 28 million tons by 1965-66; this would be 25 per cent shortfall in terms of need and that no conceivable programme of imports or rationing would meet &amp; crisis of this magnitude ( pp. 3-4). The report suggests several emergency measures and measures to be carried on over a long period, which cannot be set out here. It stresses the need for research in agricultural economics. It recommends (p. 11 ) that the entire nation must be made aware of the imponding food crisis and steps must be taken to meet it and warns that adequate supplies of food are essential to the survival of democracy. Two short-comings of the report may be pointed out. It does not tell us what funds would be required for research and for implementing the numerous other suggestions it makes. Besides, it says nothing about the birth rate in India and measures to curb the phenomenal rise in population.</p>
<p>According to U. N. Demographic Year book (August 1960 ) there are about 2900 million people in the world. More than half of the world&rsquo;s inhabitants live in four countries viz. China ( 669 millions ), India ( 438 millions), Soviet Union (209 millions ), U. 8. A. ( 178 millions ). Population growth dependa upon the birth rate and the death rate. Owing to scientific discoveries, epidemics or such diseasos as malaria, typhoid, cholera, influenza are either eliminated or brought under control and therefore the death rate tends to be lower and lower. It is the birth rate that has to be controlled. The following table 365 for comparative birth rate and death rate in 1957 for eight countries is interesting :</p>
<p>Country</p>
<p>Birth Rate per thousand.</p>
<p>Death rate per thousand.</p>
<p>India Australia Canada Ceylon France Sweden U. K. U. 8. A.</p>

</ol>
<p>Comparative birth rates and death rates</p>
<p>1687</p>
<p>This table shows that the birth rate in our country is not very high or abnormal and the death rate is also similar to that of such progressive countries as France and U. K. Many Western countries have no definito population policy at Govt. level. But the case of our country is entirely different. Our country has already a buge population, most of which is on the margin of subsistence level. Supposing that by means of our two Five Year Plans the national income in the ten years (1951–1961 ) increased 30 percent, the growth of population in the same period would come to about 22 percent, so that most of the additional wealth produced would be eaten up by the new mouths that have to be fed and the standard of living of the average Indian would practioally remain the same. Therefore, the main problem that faces the Government, the planners and the people is how to control the large growth of population. Population control will not solve all the problems of our country, but our other problems will not be solved without solving that problem. The Government of India and the Planners had no well thought policy about the control of population, Government appears to lay far more emphasis on industrialization and agricultural production than on population control. In the first Five Year Plan only 65 lakhs of rupees were allocated to the schemes of population control, in the 2nd Five Year Plan the allocation was raised to five crores. The Planning Commission has now realized the gravity of the problem of the enormous growth of Indian population, has provided 50 crores of rupees in the Third Plan for the various schemes of population control ( vide pp. 676 ff. of Third Five Year Plan). In the whole world about 100 people are born every minute, about 6000 persons every hour, about 140,000 every day and about five crores every year. This problem of the phenomenal growth of population Overshadows in urgency and importance almost every problem of the contemporary world, much more 80 of India. Very little is being done to control systematically the terrific growth of numbers. Sweden in the early 19th century was a poverty stricken country, but now it is one of the progressive and prosperous countries of the world owing to hard work, co-opera tion, honesty, social and personal discipline. Birth control is a very difficult and delicate problem. Religious beliefs and prejudices have to be taken into consideration. In Rgvedio times the prayer to God Indra for a newly married bride had been' bountiful Indra 1 may ten gons be born of her and make har husband the eleventh (member of the family ).' Later on</p>

<p>History of Dharmaśāstra (Sec. X, Ch. XXXVII</p>
<p>some kindly soul took compassion on women and made the blessing to bo. of eight sons'. The Mahābhārata said that a sonless man does not reach blessed worlds ( heaven &amp;c). By the birth of a son the father was deemed to have discharged his debt to his ancestors and the water and pindas ( balls of cooked rice ) offered by the son to his deceased father and other deceased ancestors were supposed to be of great efficacy for the peace of the departed souls, Vide H. of Dh. Vol. II pp. 560-61, 799 and above p. 1626 This importance of a son or sons is believed to this day by almost all illiterate or educated people in India except a few men and women of advanced views. Educated brides sometimes request that the old mode of blessing for eight sons should not be followed. Therefore, in such cases the formula has to be changed to&rsquo;may you have as many sons as you desire'. The Smstis lay down that the husband has to cohabit with the wife after the first few days of her monthly illness and that he incurred the sin of embryo murder if he refused to do so without good cause. Vide H, of Dh. Vol. II pp. 570-71 and note 1327. The Mārkandeya Purāpa (Chap. 14. 5-6 ) goes a little further and gives a story in which the husband who neglected this owing to his partiality for another charming wife had to undergo torments of hell. The prosent high prices of the necessaries of life induce many people to limit families by various devices. The Planning Commission is going to try various measures such as intensive education, provision of facilities and advice on the largest scale possible, providing family planning services at 1864 rural and 330 urban medical and health centres, numbers of sterilization centres, opening 6100 clinics in rural areas and 2100 in urban areas ( in 2nd Plan only 549 urban and 1100 rural clinics ), distribution of simple contraceptives, research programme for more effective contraceptives etc. The 3rd Plan reports that in the 2nd Plan period 125000 sterilization operations were carried out (p. 678 of Third Plan). The present author is not an expert in these matters and so will content himself by pointing out that sterilization and, particularly contraceptives, are double-edged Weapons. Sterilization for males is easy and may become popular among well-to-do men for selfish reasons (such as not wanting children and not undertaking the task of bringing them up). Therefore, a rule would have to be made and rigorously enforced that no sterilization will be done unless the man has three children or more.

<p>.Birth control by contraceptives etc.</p>
<p>1889</p>
<p>West Europe, North America, Japan exclusively by the well-to do type of people. The same might happen in India. The most serious objection against contraceptives is that they will lead to immorality and encourago promiscuity in both sexes, Gandhiji in bis Self-restraint versus self-indulgence' (3rd. ed., 1928) stated that so far as India is concerned there is no case for contraceptives (p. 3) and advised self-restraint. But he might have changed his opinion if he had been alive today. To advise poor people to practise self restraint, when most of them live in hovels of one room or two rooms, who are uneducated and have no ambitions and pass life in abject poverty, sounds to them as a huge joke. The well-to-do have many interests in life and several outlets for their energy but for the poor there are very fow. It is interesting to note that the Prime Minister in his</p>
<p>• Autobiography &lsquo;( 1936 ) strongly criticizes Gandhiji&rsquo;s praise of poverty, suffering and ascetic life as utterly wrong, harmful and impossible of achievement ( p. 510 ) and regards Gandhiji&rsquo;s attitude to sex as extraordinary (p. 51% ).</p>
<p>Dr. Radhakrishnan in &lsquo;Religion and Society &lsquo;(published in 1947 ) concedes (p. 189) that the use of contraceptives cannot be altogether forbidden, quotes Dawson to the effect that birth control by abstention is either ineffective or, if effective, pernicious (p. 90 ), that objections to birth control by contra ceptives are due to their abuse and that in the present conditions facilities for birth control must be available, especially to poorer olasses (p. 191 ). Contraceptives would have to be harmless to use, cheap, easy to use and absolutely reliable. The author is not sure if thore are contraceptives of this type. Japan, a small country of islands, was compelled by the rapid growth of popu lation to legalise abortions. Vide . Aggression and Population&rsquo; by F. James Dawson (London, 1946 ) for a thoughtful book on how to check worldwide growth of population. A thoughtful and exhaustive work is &lsquo;Population and planned parenthood in India&rsquo; by S.

<p>The two five year plans have given our leaders a cortain mastery over the aituation and some confidence abut the future, But Mr. Nanda has to admit that the produ ativity and level of efficienoy are very low. Foreign aid raises difficult questions as to how to match it with an adequate mobilization of domestic resouTCOS. The mass of people are poverty-striokon, have a low standard of living and therefore can save little. High prices, which is a concomitant of develop mont plans in all countries, are making common people disoontented.</p>
<p>Foreign assistance runs into thousands of crores of rupeen, Rearly half of which comes from U. 8. A. The United States Information Service has propared a detailed statement of assistance to India for ten years from June 1951 to 4th August 1961 and circulated it to many Indians from which some striking figures are quoted here. A statement brought up only to June 30 of 1961 gives slightly smallor numbers as compared with the statemont given below which brings up the figures up to 4th August 1961,</p>
<p>Extent of U. 8. Å aid to India</p>
<p>1691</p>
<p>U. 8. Government aid consists of grants and loans. Granto are gifts and do not involve any repayment. The grants in ton years total 1128,5 million dollars (537.4 croros of rupees ). Loans involve repayment, some in dollars and some in rupees or dollars at the option of the Indian Government. Repayment in rupees does not involve the utilization of India&rsquo;s foreign exchange earnings or the export of goods from India. Eighty porcent of U. 8. loans to India up to Aug. 4, 1961 ( 2192.1 million dollars ) are ropayable in rupees i, e. that portion of the loans is not so inconvenient as the loans repayable in dollars are.</p>
<p>On p. 110 of Third Five Year Plan the foreign exchange requirements are put down at 2030 crores of Rs. for plan projects. But there are other general needs of the economy by way of raw materials, components, replacement machinery to be provided for. It is estimated that Rs. 3800 crores over the five years would be not too high. On p. 114 it is stated that the total assistance for the Third Plan assured by foreign countries is 2286 million dollars ( Rs. 1089 orores ) out of which the USA has agreed to provide 1045 million dollars (just under half of the total foreign assistance), West Germany 425 million dollars, U.

<p>The preceding table shows that in the last ten years, India has become indebted to the USA in the huge sum of 2655 million dollars (some payablo in dollars alone and the rest in rupees if India chose that way ). In the Third Plan USA has agreed to provide India up to 1045 million dollars i. e. at the end of the 15 years from 1951 India may owe to U.S.A. 3700 million dollars, that is roughly about 1756 crores of rupees (at Rs. 43 per dollar ). India will probably owe a larger amount to all the other lending countries taken together. The most serious question is how and in how many years India will repay the debts that run into astronomical figures. The explanatory memorandum accompanying the Central Budget for 1961-6% shows that India&rsquo;s public debt stood at Rs. 949 crores on 31st March 1939. On the 31st March 1962 it will reach the huge figure of 5554 crores. Adding the liability of Govt. to repay various deposits placed with Govt, under the Post Office Savings Bank, National Plan Savings, Provident Funds, Saving Deposit Certificates etc. which account for Rs. 1868 crores, India&rsquo;s obligations would really come to 7422 crores of Rs. (5554 +-1868), at the end of March 1962. Our interest yielding assets are only Rs. 5725 croreg. If we add to this huge gun the debts our Govt will owe to U. 8. A. and other sountries as shown in the</p>
<p>Colossal amount of debts owed by India</p>
<p>1693</p>
<p>above table, at the end of the third plan India would be indebted in the colossal figure of about Rs. 11000 crores.</p>
<p>While these pages were passing through the Press, the author received a statement from the USA. Information Servioe in Bombay, which brings the figures up to 12th March 1962. It states that the American Economio assistance to India from June 1951 to 12th March 1962 totals 4118 million dollarg ( = 1960.9 crores of Rupees) as shown in the table below:</p>

<p>It is not necessary to go into other details. The loans are ropayable at different dates, some being repayable in forty years and some carrying a very low rate of interest. It may, however, be noted that ont of about 4000 million dollarg aid to India since Independence over half has been in the form of P. L. 480 Food for commodities. The Food Minister of India, Mr. S. K. Patil, assures us, however, that India would become completely self suffoient in food by the end of the Third Five Year Plan and points out that during the last decade, foodgrain production in India rose from 50 to 80 million tons a year, an increase of 60 por cent. But it should not be forgotten that the population of India in the same ten years increased by about 2% per cent over the population in 1951.</p>
<p>&ldquo;! The Welfare State theoretically aims at (Sarvodaya). prosperity for all ( at least for the vast majority ). Up to recent times, the main obligations of the State towards its people were the administration of the country, the defence of the country and its coast against aggression or invasion, maintenance of law, and order, primary and bigher education. The ambition of the framers of the Indian Constitution and our leaders is to create a welfaro state, and to reconstruct the present social and economio order on a socialistic pattern by subjecting the country to a planned economy. Soveral vital industries are now reported</p>

<p>for the State and Government has assumed power to regulate production, to control distribution and to fix even the prioes of some commodities absolutely necessary to all men in daily life. It has also established the State Trading Corporation. Taxation has become an ever-inoreasing instrument of economic policy for carrying out the plan projects. Apart from the income-Tax Aot ( XI of 1922 recently consolidated by Act 43 of 1961) our demooratio Government passed one after another four Acts, vis. the Estate Duty Act ( XXXIV of 1953), the Wealth Tax ( XXVI of 1957 ), the Expenditure Tax ( XXIX of 1957 ) and the Gift Tar (XVI of 1958). There is no other country in the world that has all the above five taxes. Is India the only welfare country in the world? There is a senge of uncertainty and fright in the middle classes and tax dodging in the rich or influential sections of the community. Reasons of space prevent the citing of illustrations of the arbitrary character of the recent four Aots. In all these Acts the opinions of the Govt. officers (viz. Gift Tax officer, expenditure tax officer, and wealth tax officer and higher officers ) in an executive ladder under the same Acts on questions of fact (such as the value of a property ) are final and cannot be questioned in any court of justice ( i. e, in a subordinate judge&rsquo;s court or district judge&rsquo;s court or High Court). If a creditor releases a debtor from his debts ( wholly or partly ) the oreditor will have to pay gift tax on the debt released if the gift tax officer is of opinion that he could have recovered the debt by means of legal steps. No man can make a gift of more than 100 rupees at one time to a private person or even &amp; noar relative (except to his wife ) and I he makes several gifts to the same person in one year exceeding five hundred rupoes he will have to pay gift tar. In all cases of questions of fact one appeal should have been allowed to a district court or where the amount concerned wall more than ten thousand rupees to the High Court. It should be recognized by policy-makers that our people have great faith in the integrity of the High Courts and the distriot judges who are selected by the High Courts and whose promotion dans not depend on the Executive. They have not much faith in the fairness and integrity of Appellate Commissiopers and Tribunala that are appointed by the Ministers, when the dispute is between private persons and taxing authorities on behalf of Government, Writers on the constitutions of countries have for many years empbasized two loading features viz. the sovereignty of Parliament and the rule of law.

<p>The New Despotism</p>

This is what is called the New Despotism &lsquo;by Lord Chief Justice Howart of Great Britain, 2559 in the name of the Welfare State it seems that all power is being centralized in bureauoraoy by our leaders,</p>
<p>Most common pepople in India have a very vague notion of what socialism means. They believe that socialism is based on Marxism. 2652 Marx holds that revolution is the weapon or means by which the workers are to seize power, that his theory is scientifio and based on a study of facts. He himself declared that he was no &lsquo;Marxist&rsquo; ( vide. Naked God&rsquo; p. 3 by Howard Fast, New York, 1957 and New Class&rsquo; by Milovan Djilas p. 4 London, 5th Impression, 1958). These words of his are explained by Dr. Radhakrishnan as meaning that he was not pledged to the acceptance of a doctrine, final, complete and oppressive ( vide. Religion and Society,&rsquo; 1947, p. 25). This is not the place to discuss the premises and predictions of Marx, But a few words may be said here. Marx had predioted that communism would provail first in the most developed and industrialized nations. What happened is quite the opposite of this. Communism occurred in countries like Russia and China that were relatively very much less developed and industrialized. Another of his predictions was that the system of private ownership would make the rich richer and the poor poorer, would</p>

Pollard in &lsquo;Conscionce and liberty&rsquo; (Allen and Unwin, London, 1940 ). Vide also · Bureaucracy triumphant' by C. K. Allen ( London, 1931). All these taxing enactments have created a bigh ladder of officers appointed by the executive. For example, under the Wealth Tax Act there is Girst the Wealth Tax Officer who decides what tax is payable, thop there is an appeal to the Appellate Assistant Commissioner (Sec, 23), then there is a farther appeal to the Appellate Tribunal (Sec. 24 ), then there can be a reference to the High Court on a point of law (Séc. 27-28) and finally an appeal to the Supreme Court (Sec, 29). This is sheer harassment and practical denial of justice. Affer a private person bas run to three different officers or official bodies then only the High Court comes in, if at all, and that too on a point of law. It should be remembered that the wealth tax officer has often to determine the value of properties worth lakhs of rupees and on points of fact there are appeals only to tko first officer&rsquo;s saperiors and there is no provision for a probe of facts by a court or judicial officer independent of the executive. A similar procedura is provided in the Gṛft Tax, the Expenditare Tax and Estate Daty Taxi</li>

<p>breed ruinous depressions and in the end the angry proletariat would revolt, would overthrow the exploiting classes and establish a communist society. This second prophecy has not materialized in almost all highly industrialized nations. On the contrary, several democratio States have provided security against unemployment, sickness and old age and in some countries employers have admitted representatives of workers into the management of industries. The &lsquo;Communist Manifesto&rsquo; is the official Bible in the U.S. S. R. A recent work The &ldquo;Anatomy of the Soviet man' by Claus Mehport, translated from Gorman by Maurice Rosenbaum (1961 ), appears to the present author to contain a balanced and fair estimate of the working of Communism in U. S. S. R. He points out that the desire to rise socially and amass wealth and power is as common to the Soviet Union as to the rest of the world (p. 84 ), that the New Class does not constitute a bourgeoisie in the West European sense, that it is a State bourgeoisie, all members work for the State and are dependent on it (p. 73 ), that social distinotions ara greater in U.S. S. R. than in U. S. A. (p. 109 ), that the greatest disproportion prevails between the incomes of Academicians, artists and writers on the one hand and ordinary men and workers on the other. It appears to the present author that Communism has so far been the best means for the exploitation of the proletariat,</p>
<p>No great Indian leader of the present day has offered a luoid and considered statement of wbat the philosophical foundations of Indian socialism are or should be, nor has any leader placed before the people a clear and full picture of the Indian socialistic pattern of the future in all its aspects. In the Plan structures welfare seems to be identified with broad, physical and material comforts. Marx denied God and advocated the forcible liquidation of the exploiting classes. Our Constitution does not mention God (except in schedule II about oaths and affirmations of Ministers and M. P.&rsquo;s) nor does it emphasize moral and spiritual valnos, though the founding fathers of the U.S.A. prescribe( in the Declaration of American Independence ) &ldquo;All men are created equal. They are endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights; among them are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness'. Of course it is wrong and unscientific to say that all men are created equal if literally construed (as even children of the same parents are not equal in height, strength and mental equipment). All that is meant is that all men are equal in the eye of the law or have the same rights before the law. Truth.</p>

<p>and non-violenoe are not mentioned in our Constitution, though these were the basio prinoiples from Upanigad and Smrti times ( as in Chandogya III. 17.4, Manu X, 63, Yāj. I. 122) and for Gandhiji by whom all Congressmen and their leaders swear, Lands of thousands of men of the middle class of small means were taken away from them by changing the fundamental right to property bestowed by Art. 31 (as originally onaobed ), by preventing recourse to law courts and by giving illusory hopes of some compensation not yet even determined after several years. This may not be liquidation of opponents, yet it is a cruel thing all the same in the name of democracy and Welfare State, 2653</p>
<p>Borrowing in the country itself and from foreign countries has beon resorted to on an increasing scale.</p>

Among the sources for the plan are included Provident Funds, Post Office savings bank accounts, National Plan Certificates &amp;o. These are really debts, though not demandable on any one date or year. Deficit financing whioh did not form part of the central budget in past years has now become a regular item.

The latter phrase refers to more specialized work for the weak or more vulnerable sections of the popolation (such as women, children, physically handicapped persons like the deal, dumb and blind, mentally retarded, scheduled castes and tribes and backward classes). A Welfare State wants to change the pattern of life of the whole community or country. Our Constitution in Article 15 (paragraphs 3 and 4 ) authorizes the State to make special provisions for women and children and for the advancement of backward classes, scheduled castes and scheduled tribes and Article 16 para 4 authorizes the State to make provision for the reservation of appolatments or posts ia favour of any backward class of citizens. Articles 338-342 deal with the appointment of a special officer for the scheduled castes and scheduled tribes and with the appointment by the President of India of a Commission to report on the administration of scheduled areas and scheduled tribes and for specification from time to time of the castes, races or tribes in a list of the scheduled caste, aad tribes.</p>

<p>rupeeg and the expenditure at 1381.65 orores of rupees and it is announced that a total deficit of about 150 crores would have to be met partly by additional taxation of 60 crores and 80 lakhs of rupees. It must be remembered that most of these taxes are indirect and the major part of the income from such taxes is due to levies on articles of everyday necessity to common people who are already groaning under high prices of absolutely necessary commodities. The Bombay Government&rsquo;s Budget for 1962-63 intended to tax the poor man&rsquo;s bidis and gur (jaggery). About 7000 crores were put in the State sector in the 1st and 2nd Plan projects and 7500 crores are proposed to be spent in the Public sector in the 3rd plan period. Thus at the end of the 3rd Plan ( in 1965-66 ) Government will have spent about 15000 orores of rupees. Tremendous power will be concentrated in the hands of ministers and the official bureaucracy. It is not generally known how Government has dealt with or will deal with this vast amount, what projects have been undertaken, which of them are completed, the cost of the completed projects, yearly yield from the projects that are completed, steps that are being taken to repay debts and to what extent. There are fervent appeals made by leaders to common people to co-operate with Govt, but the Govt. does not seem to be anxious to take people into confidence by widely circulating through newspapers, press-notes or otherwise information on the above mentioned matters. The vast sums spont on projects have caused inflation, Besides, during the two five year Plans population increased by 77 millions. This accentuated the problem of unemployment and on p. 47 of the book above referred to it is admitted that at the end of 10 years the backlog of unemployment is estimated at nine millions.</p>
<p>Sir W. Beveridge in Pillars of Security' (1944) names five giants with which humanity has to struggle viz, want, disease, ignorance, squalor and idleness. (p. 43) The last, that is, unemployment, should be the first point of attack. Art. 41 of qur Constitution confers the right to work, to education and to public assistance in case of unemployment, old age, Bioknese and in certain other cases. It is not easy to give full employ ment for all. The State must try to limit numborg and provide not merely for literary education but also for vocational and technical training on a very extensive scale. Industrialization is necessary but it is not an unmixed blessing. Discussion of these matters would require far more space than can be afforded in this chapter,Dangers of recent public administration</p>

<p>One last word before taking leave of the subjeots of Democraoy, Welfare State, Socialistic pattern, legislation, planning for social and economio reconstruction. In the new set-up publio administrators have become the brains behind the production of economic goods. They have, however, to do in the now sphere work which is entirely different from their traditional work in the Government of former times. Production activity in modern days demands bringing together and co-ordinating various skills and complex tasks to which administrators in Govt. offices are often strangers. How far they will be able to accomplish the new tasks undertaken by them is a matter which admits of no certain answer. But the most perplexing and baffling question is : Can all-comprehensive national plans under which the State either owng or controls:most aspects of economic activities in Agriculture, Industry and Trade be implemented democratically by Parliamentary control? The present author is very much afraid that the combination of economic and political power in the hands of a few ministers, high ranking officials and politicians would be so overpowering as to reduce the present Parliament (based on universal adult suffrage, only 23 percent of the population being literate ) to a more shadow and may in some respects at least narrow the liberties of men almost as much as the totalitarian State does.</p>
<p>Let us now turn to the reform and reorganization of Hindu Society and religion. The Portuguese came to India towards the end of the 15th century and acquired some territory on the Western coast of India. But owing to religious intolerance and persecution by them not much impression was made by them on Hindu society. But the case was different with the British, who did not imitate the Portuguese in the matter of religion, but wanted trade, wealth and power. On account of the British rule established over a large part of India from 1765 A. D. Indians oame in contact with modern English literature and modern science. The earliest Indian reformor in modern times was a Bengali, Raja Ram Mohan Roy (1772-1833). He founded the Brāhmo Samāja in 1828. Some of the great names in the effort to reorganize and reform Hindu society and religion are those of Devendranath Tagore (1817-1905), Keskub Chandra Sen (1838-1884), Ishvarachandra Vidyasagar, Dayānand (1824-1883 ) who founded the Aryagamāja in 1877 and who regarded only the Vedas as authoritative, Ramakrishna Paramahamsa ( 1834–1886 ) and his great disciple Swami Vivekananda (1863-1902), who founded the Ramkrishna Mission</p>

<p>There is a great forment of ideas in India at present. Many of our countrymen, whether young or old, do not derive any inspiration from their religion. It is not the fault of religion, but the fault lies with us and our predecessors who did not and do not exhibit to us the core of our culture and religion, do not sift the essentials and separate them from the unessential acoretions due to superstitions and wrong emphasis. Ordinary men of to-day feel bewildered by the disagroentents between scientific knowledge and the traditional beliefs. The result is that traditional values and codes of conduct are disintegrating and various views are being bandied about. There are now Hoveral distinct thought-forms on matters religious or spiritual. One class calls itself sanātanis whose view is that the traditional codes of conduct and beliefs were established by the all-wise sages of old and therefore modern half-baked reformers have no right at all to introduce changes in them. Thore is another class ( allied to these ) of those who have studied such modern sciences as eugenics and biology, who oppose change on the ground that our traditions embodied in the caste system and the restrictive rules about marriage are most scientific and no obange should be made in them and if made disaster will follow. There is another class of people who say why do you quarrel with us? Time will bring about all necessary changes&rsquo;. Thoro are other people who go to the other extreme and deny the existence of any divine or spiritual realities and values in the world. Some believe in the efficacy of laws to introduce desired obanges. There are people who say. take the essential values of Indian culture as foundation and build thereon a struoturo in keeping with the needs of the times&rsquo;. Hinduism has always been growing and changing traditions ( vide for examples above pp. 1267-7% and 1471 ).

Ancient and medieval Dharmaśāstra writers held the viow that the king had no authority to interfere with Sastric rules governing varnas and castes. Vide H. of Dh. vol. III pp. 98-101 for the proposition that there was almost total absence of logislative power in the king according to Dharmaśāstra writers. Changes in practices and beliefs, however, did take place, but it was learner commentators that by various devices tried to support changes that had already taken place (vide pp. 1267-1272 above). There are really three well-marked classes of people, viz. Sanātanis or no-changers, the iconoclasts and those who want a synthesis of the old and the new.</p>
<p>The question is what should be conserved or discarded from the old practices and what new ideals or values should be added and assimilated. Reasons of space forbid saying much about values here. Values are largely moulded by environment. Only a century or two ago, slavery or racial inequality and pride, sweating children of tender age in factories were accepted in Christian countries as morally neutral or at least not disrepu. table. But at present some of these, if not all, are generally condemned as immoral. In India also values have changed from time to time. At one time animal sacrifices were quite reputable and of high other-worldly value. Later in the Upanigad times Ahiingā came to the fore. But there are certain values of our culture that have endured for three thousand years, vis. the consciousness that the whole world is the manifestation of the Eternal Essence, restraint of senses, charity and kindness, Now we are in an age of democracy and the important values of democracy are justice, liberty, equality and fraternity. But unfortunately many of those who sing paeans of democracy in India banker aftor power and are in the grip of selfishness and hatred. Lord Acton wrote &ldquo;All power corrupts and absolute power corrupta absolutely.&rdquo; Kautilya said more than two thon sand years ago that power warps ( intoxicatea ) the mind. Vide H. of Dh. vol. 11. p. 114 and n. 151 for quotations.</p>

<p>women, while getting rid of superstitions and beliefs opposed to all science and common sense. It is not the age-old principles of Hindu religion that are at fault, it is modern Hindu society that has to be reorganized, particularly when ours is now a democratio republic; and our leaders must make supreme efforts for many years to preserve oquality in the midst of very great exonomic inequality, liberty which is likely to be overwhelmed by mighty parties and social groups and democracy against demagogues on the one hand and plutoorats on the other.</p>
<p>We must not shut our eyes to the peculiar and formidable difficulties of our country.2654 Even the present India (i. e. Bhārat ) is a vast country. There are in present India adherents of eight great religious systems ( Hindu, Buddhist, Jain, Sikh, Moslem, Parai, Christianity and Judaism ), besides some tribes following none of these, but their own primitive systems; there are different States based on 14 different languages ( mentioned in the 8th schedule to the Constitution of India ), besides six Union territories and about 200 recognized dialects. These are likely to produce movemonte towards complete provincial autonomy and cultural separation. There are great contrasts among the inhabitants, at one end the primitive tribes and the people who were untouchables and at the other end highly educated men and, in between the two, groups of illiterate people numbering at present about 77 per cont of the whole population. After centuries of conquests by alien people our country has gained independence. This opons</p>
<p>2654 For a somewhat captious and depressing portrayal of our difficulties by an apparently unsympathetic and unhelpfal critic, vide .Iadia, the most dangerous decades &lsquo;by Selig S. Harrison (Oxford Uolversity Press, 1960), The trend of the wbole book is mainly to drive home one point viz. that democracy will not live or be successful in India, The book, it is believed, is mainly intended for non-Indian readers. The author insists too much on the obscurantist tendencies of some Indian people in the matter of caste. If he felt real sympathy and real friendship for the now democracy in India, he should bave emphasized tbe points that make. for doity in India, viz. the absence of an organized Church (like . Protestant or the Roman Catholic Church ), that Hinduism is a personal religion, that Hindus can easily adapt themselves to the requirements of modera democracy as shown by the three elections bold so far without any serious disturbances when there were millions upon millions of voters, ban and womeo. If he really wanted to help the Indian people, he should have stressed matters that favour democracy and not constantly barped on North India and South India, on Hiadi and anti-Hladi, many States and language difficulties.</p>
<p>Our great opportunities for creative thinking and work</p>
<p>1703</p>
<p>for ug a new vista of creative thinking and work, We need not give up the basic principles of Hinduism, but should reorientate them to meet new and more complex conditions and work out a changed social order. Everybody says that what is wanted is an emotional integration of Indians and some have suggested that the caste system should be destroyed. If the Gaste system were &amp; tangible thing it could have been easily and quiokly destroyed. But it is not tangible. Legislation cannot destroy it. Only a change of heart with appropriate remedies and vast efforts persistently made over a long period may accom plish this Herculean task and not glib talk by people that hardly ever practise in their lives what they preach. In the prosent author&rsquo;s opinion States purely on linguistic basis should not have been created at all, but once it was resolved to create them, that should have been strictly adhered to and clear definite principles should have been laid down by the Central Government about assigning border villages to one State or another. The Central Government leadership has been most vacillating in this respect. For exmple, there were at least five different proposals put forward on Bombay City alone viz. a bilingual state (in which Bombay City was merged), a city State for Bombay alone with separate states of Gujarat and Maharashtra, central administration for five years, a return to the bilingual formula, and lastly separate Maharashtra (inclu ding Bombay City, Berar and Marathwada ) and a separate State of Gujarat, with about 200 villages taken over from the Khandesh and Thana districts that had been part of Maharashtra for over one hundred years.</p>
<p>The oaste system, the joint family system and the laws of Succession and inheritance that are peculiar to Hindus are really social matters and not religious matters at all. Our Constitution and recent legislation deal with all the three, holding that these are social matters. As shown above, the Constitution abolished untouchability, the Hindu Marriage Act has done away with all prohibitions against marriages between porsons of different castes and a Hindu can have marriage relations with any Hindu ( including Buddhist, Jain and Sikh ) and can take any Hindu woman da spouse subject only to the rules of sapinga relationship and prohibited degrees for marriage. The Hindu Succession Act has practically done away with the joint family Bystem as shown above, though it has not been expressly Abrogated.</p>

<p>What is wanted is not more declamations against the caste system and fervent appeals for emotional integration of all Indians but a comprehensive code or scheme of beliefs and day to day conduct. The present writer cannot enter here into a detailed code or goheme which might require a volume by itself but some concrete proposals if set out here may induce more competent writers to give better and more exhaustive patterns. Let there be churning of thoughts. It is possible that in the beginning one may meet with formidable and learful difficulties as in the mythological churning of the ocean, but let us hope that, even after the emergence of frightful things, the final result would be blissful, as in the churning of the ocean poison emerged but the whole effort was crowned with the appearance of amata at the end,</p>
<p>We must not despair of solving our difficult problems. Despair means destruction and death. We must not lose courage by the condition of our country for the last few centuries. We should rather look to our achievements during about three thousand years and take to heart the following advice of ancient Bages of the Dharmśāstras such as that of Manu. Manu says (IV.137 )3455 &lsquo;one should not despise oneself on account of previous failures; one should seek (make efforts for securing) prosperity till one&rsquo;s death and should not regard prosperity as unattainable.&rsquo; To the same effect is Yāj. when he says &lsquo;One should never despise a learned brāhmaṇa, a serpent, a ksatriya (a king) or oneself; one should desire to secure prosperity till one&rsquo;s death and should not touch (i. e, make public) another&rsquo;s weak points (misdeeds &amp;c.)&rsquo; We are over 43 crores of people, We are proud of the achievements of our forefathers. If wo work bard in a concerted and intelligent effort for years with the solo object of bringing about the highest development of the country and without ambitions of securing individual profit or fame there is no reason why our country shculd not outstrip or at least equal other countries in the world. The Isopanigad 2 (Vāj. S. 40.2 ) ordains for all common men &lsquo;one should wish to live for a hundred years, always doing here ( in this world) actions ( prescribed by the śāstra ).&rsquo; The Ait. Br. (chap. 33.5), in the story of Sunaḥsepa insists on men being always active and emphasizes that prosperity does not come to him who does</p>

<p>In 1934 some persons under the guidance of Swami Kovalānanda Sarasvati of Wai ( Satara District) started a society which later came to be named &lsquo;Dharmapirnaya mapdala&rsquo; 2656 (society for arriving at definite conclusions on matters of Dharma ). The Swami was a very learned man and a Sandyāsin, did not know English, but he held very modern views. There were fourteen original founder members of whom the present author is one. From 1934 to 1959 eleven sessions attended by hundreds of people were held at Thana, Poona (twice), Lonavla (thrice ), Abmednagar, Badalapur (Diet. Thana ), Vardha (in Berar), Akolā (in Berar ), Wai and Bombay. At the different sessions resolutions were passed (in all 82 ) on several social and religious matters and a committee was appointed to prepare model prayogas (procedures ) for Sandhyā, congregational (sāmudāyika) prayer, upanayana, marriage, untyeṣti ( funeral rites ), śrāddha, remarriage ( of widows ), ro-conversion to Hinduism &amp;c. That Committee prepared under the guidance of Swāmi Kovalānanda such prayogas shorn of unnecessary details and with translations in Marathi, which can be had from Mr. Kokaje of Lonavla. Among the resolutions the following deserve special mention: usages have been changed from time to time by former learned men ( sistas ) and the learned men of the present day have the authority to introduce changes in usages as the present circumstances may require; that the untouchability of the people of certain oastes be abolished (Art. 17 of the Constitution of Indie subseque. ntly did this ); that those sub-castes that have similar usages,</p>

( almost the game grounds as in sec. 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act of 1955 ); a Hindu widow succeeding as heir to her husband takes an absolute estate except when any of the following relatives of the husband are alive, viz. daughter, daughter&rsquo;s son, mother, father, brothers brother&rsquo;s son, paternal grand-parents, paternal first cousin ( vide Hindu Succession Act, 30 of 1956 sec. 14 which goes further by omitting the near relatives specified above ). Most of the. decisions mentioned above were proclaimed from ten to twenty years before our Constitution came into operation.</p>
<p>Among the standing complaints against brābmaṇas one bas been that they debarred millions of people called &lsquo;Sūdras&rsquo; from Vedic studies. Therefore, the Mandala announced that all Hindus ( including the so called untouchables ) should observe the worship of the sun, repetition of the Gāyatri-mantra ( Rg. III. 62.10, Tai. S. 1. 5. 6.4, Vāj. S. III. 35 ) and reading or recital of the Bhagavadgitā (whole or part) every day, since thogo common observances would help in creating the sentiment of</p>

<p>In order to cultivate a sense of unity among all Hindus (including the so-called untouchables), the Mandala prepared a congregational prayer ( to be recited by all Hindus in &amp; con gregation once in a month ) consisting of the following eleven pagsagos culled from the Vedic literature, viz. Atharvaveda X. 8.1, Rg. X. 82.3, I. 164.16, Vāj. 8. 25.21, Rg. X. 121. 10, Tai, Ār. 4.42.5, the Gayatrimantra, Bļ. Up. I. 3,28 (asato mā sad-gamaya, tamago mā jyotir-gamaya, mṛtyor māsmrtam gamaya), Rg. X. 191.2-4. In many villages some people tried to introduce this congregational prayer, but after some time most people complained that they found it difficult to commit to memory and recite the Vedic passages and requested that similar con gregational prayers be prepared in Hindi and therefore the Mandala prepared a brief prayer of five yerses in Hindi.</p>
<p>The above lines would only briefly illustrate how we would have to proceed if we want an emotional integration of all our countrymon, partioularly on the social and religious plane. But we must not forget what the foundation of our culture and civilization has been throughout the past ages. Ancient sages laid the foundation by insisting upon this that there is and must be harmony between man&rsquo;s spirit and the spirit of the world and man&rsquo;s endeavour should be to realize in his actions and in his life this harmony and unity.2659 The Upaniṣads teach that man gains by giving up ( by renunciation) and exhorts man not to covet another&rsquo;s wealth (Isopaniṣad I &lsquo;tona tyaktona bhuñjitha mā grdhaḥ kasya gvid dhanam&rsquo;).</p>

<p>The Bhagavadgitā emphasized doing one&rsquo;s duty without hankering for the rewards thereof. Science oannot answer such fundamental questions as occur to every thoughtful person viz. what is the ultimate cause, is it brahman, what is our origin, by what are we sustained, what is our destiny (goal), being influenced by what do we persist in patbs leading to pain and misery (Sv. Up. I. I). They are answered by the ancient2660 Upanisada, but not by science so far.</p>
<p>The chief aim of Indian culture and civilization was not to attain military and political power over other countries and peoples; it neglected to organize Indians for offensive and defensive purposes, nor encouraged the starting of immense corporations for the acquisition of wealth. But in those days of koon competition between nations and peoples we must not only koop a vigilant eye on the eternal principles of our culture but also on the worldly happiness of our countrymon in the midst of the warring elements in the world. Our people often took and take to premature vairāgya(renunciation),while Western nations and men have been laying for the last few centuries great store by extreme activity. Now that our leaders are thinking of remodelling our society and spiritual life they must cultivate qualities whereby they at least will be sthitaprajña i. e. fully developed or ideal souls (Bhagavadgitā II. 55–68) or men of God (Gita XIII. 13-18).

From time immemorial all religious cults in India (except Buddhism and Jainism) recognized that there was One Principle (or Deity of some kind ) and in the immortality of the soul. The tremendous march of science and mastery over soma of the forces of nature has gone to the heads of many modern mion and made them conceited. Science can disclose to us at the most secondary causes; but it has to be silent as to the ultimate cause and the ultimate destiny of man. It cannot tell us what the purpose of life is, it cannot tell us anything about moral values, The present and the following generations have to be trained in an environment where spiritual life, love of truth, sense of and belief in the brotherhood of man or at least of our owcountry. men, love of peace and sympathy for the oppressed would be held to be supreme virtues to be attempted by all people,</p>
<p>It is most difficult to suggest in a brief space a code of conduct for all the millions of India.

<p>science should not be included in the religious creeds of these days and should be treated as more myths and legende. Many Chzistians even in these days ( and most Hindus and Moslems) believe in a heaven above and a hell or hells below. But Sabara2663 (in the first centuries of the Christian era ) holds that heaven is not a place ( vide pp. 1211-1215 above). Therefore, heaven and hell as described in ancient Sanskrit works cannot be made an article of faith for modern men. It is often said that myths may be represented as facts to simple people for the sake of beneficial results (e. g. for inducing them to perform sacrifices or to observe rules of morality &amp;c.). But this is not propor as there are dangers in this. In these days of growing popular education, when the myth becomes exposed, the men who once believed it not only give up that myth but also might give up everything contained in ancient works as unbelievable Space does not permit any elaborate cataloguing of what should be given up and what striven for in these days. Values, aims and institutions that were accepted by almost all people only a few decades ago are now challenged and new patterns are in process of being moulded. The chief catalytic agencies are modern science and Western thought and literature. The old struoture of beliefs is tottering and laxity in morals has made great headway. But whatever happens, we must so regulate society that the family as a social unit2664 is preserved and safeguarded, every child of whatever class or race must have equal opportuni ties of education, man&rsquo;s daily work must be held to be divine work and worship, great inequalities of wealth and possessions must be eliminated.</p>

<p>EPILOGUE</p>
<p>Many friends and well-wishers of the author and some readers of the volumes of the History of Dharmaśāstra have often ( personally and by correspondence) pressed him to furnish some biographical details about himself, about the circumstances in which he launched on this undertaking, about the preparations be made, about the time and labour that this undertaking cost him and also what money it brought to him (a few asked even this ).</p>
<p>To write an autobiography is a most difficult and delicate matter, In an autobiography one has often to use the words &lsquo;I!, Me&rsquo;, &lsquo;My&rsquo; etc, and the writer is liable to be charged with egotism. If he is very frank about his own failings and faults, he may be accused of exhi bitionism. I do not propose to say much about my parents or my ancestors or about my marriage and family life or my likes and dis likes. I had my own share of anxieties, troubles and sorrows, but I shall not say much about them, since the blessings that were showered On me far outweighed the anxieties and sorrows. A brief account of some aspects of my long life may, I hope, be of some interest and belp to those wbo bave to face problems similar to those that I had to face,</p>
<p>I was born on 7th May 1880 in a village called Pedhen or Paraśarima [ because it has &amp; large and famous temple of Parafu rāma, an avatāra of Vigṇu and the patron saint of several brāhmaṇa sub-castes ( such as the Citpāvana)] near Chiplun in the Ratnagiri District at my maternal uncle&rsquo;s house, My father belonged to a priestly family in a village called Murden near Khed in the Ratna giri District. My father had learnt by heart a great deal of the Rgveda and was being trained for priesthood till the age of 18. He did not like the profession of a priest and left for Poong to learn English along with a friend of his boyhood, the late Shankar Bal krishna Dixit, who later on became famous for his Marathi work on Indian Astronomy which was admired by Dr. Thibaut. Mr. Dixit and my father passed the Matriculation Examination of the Bombay University in 1873. My father stadied for the Pleader&rsquo;s examination held in those days by the Bombay High Court, passed it and began to praotise as a Taluka lawyer at Dapoli in the Ratnagiri Distriot from 1878. Besides Vedic lore, my father stadied the principal Upanigada</p>
<p>and the Gitā and had many of the former by heart. He practised as a lawyer for about forty years, then retired and passed away in 1920. We were nine children, six brothers and three sisters. I was the eldest of the sons and one sister was older than myself. In my early boyhood my father taught me some elements of astrology and advised me to commit to memory the verses of Amarakośa (of which I had</p>
<p>400 by heart before I was 12 years of age). In 1891 I joined the S. P. G. Mission&rsquo;s English High School at Dapoli and passed the Bombay University&rsquo;s Matriculation Examination in 1897 and stood high among the successful candidates. While at school, I began to suffer from hyper-acidity, consequent acute stomach pains and vomit ing at the age of 16 and had to leave school for nearly a year. At the time when I passed the Matriculation there was an epidemic of Babonic Plague in Bombay and Poona, where there was high morta lity. My father was not willing to send me ( whose health was already delicate) to those places where alone College education could then be had. So he asked me to study law under him. I studied it for two weeks, but being repelled soon by the dry study of law, 1 wrote a letter to Dr, Machichan, who was then Principal of the Wilson College in Bombay (and reputed to be very kind ), conducted by the Scottish Mission, asking him whether I could be enrolled as a student in absentia. He asked me to send Rs. 36/-, a term&rsquo;s fee, get myself registered as a student and stated that as the epidemic was at its height the University might condobe absence, The Bombay University later on did so. I did not attend College in the first term. The epidemic abated, I joined College in June and appeared for the first year&rsquo;s examination of the Bombay University in Novem ber 1898 ( which was then called the Previous Exam.) and was awarded a scholarship of Rs. 175 and a prize of Rs. 100 for being the first among the students whose second language was Sanskrit. This was the first lucky accident in my life. Life is a mysterious business. It is full of lucky incidents or chances and one must be able to take advantage of them by one&rsquo;s own efforts. There have been many such incidents and disinterested friendships in my life and I have hardly ever had an enemy to my knowledge in the whole of my rather long life. The ailment of my boyhood pursged me at college, pursues me even now and has become worse, but I did not allow myself to be much disturbed by it, controlled my diet and led a regular and strict life. At the second year&rsquo;s examination in Arts ( called Intermediate) I was awarded a scholarship of Rs. 180</p>
<p>Epilogue</p>
<p>111</p>
<p>(lump sum ) for standing first among students taking Sanskrit as a second language. Two years afterwards I appeared for the B. A. examination in 1901 and was awarded the Bhau Daji Prize for proficienoy in Sanskrit and stood first among the students of the Wilson College. An idea about how delicate I was in 1901 when I was 21 years old may be had from the fact that, though I was 5 feet 4 inches in height, I weighed only 98 pounds. After the B. A. exa mination I was a Dakṣiṇā Fellow at the Wilson College for two years and lectured to the first two years' classes at the Wilson College on Sanskrit about three hours a week. In 1902, I passed the First LL. B. examination in the First class and in 1903 the M. A. examination and was awarded the Zala Vedānta Prize of Rs. 400. The peculiarity of this prize is that the paper set is in Sanskrit, the answers are to be written in Sanskrit in three hours, the chief exa miner was to be a Sastri who was proficient in Saṅkara Vedānta and had studied it under the old traditional methods. As my father had yet to spend for the education of several sons he asked me either to enter the Education Department as a High School teacher or to become a lawyer in a subordinate court. I did not like the latter idea and applied to the Director of Public Instruction, Poona, for appointment as a teacher in a Govt. High School. Here again Dr. Machichan helped me by recommending me highly to the D. P. I. I was appointed a teacher in the Govt. High School at Ratnagiri in August 1904 on a salary of Rs. 60 per month raised to Rs. 66 per month after a few months ( having been an M. A, with five scholar ships and prizes in Sanskrit). I was at the Ratnagiri Govt. High School for three years, I appeared for the 8. T. O. ( Secondary Teacher&rsquo;s Certificate ) Examination held by the Department in 1905 and stood first in the whole of the Bombay Presidency (including Sind in those days). In the same year I submitted an essay on * Aryan Manners and Morals as depicted in the Epics' for the V. N. Mandlik Gold Medal of the Bombay University and was awarded a prize of books worth Rs. 150. For this essay I read both the Maha bhārata and the Rāmāyaṇa. Till now I have read the Mahābhārata thrice and I have yet got the notebooks of extensive extracts, parti cularly from the Mahābhārata. In the next year I appeared for a Departmental Examination for Honours in Teaching and secured first clags in &lsquo;Logic in relation to teaching &lsquo;. The same year ( 1906 ) I sub mitted a paper on the History of Alarkāra Literature for the V. N. Mandlik Gold Medal again and was awarded the medal. At the end</p>
<p>of this year I lost my younger brother by T. B. I was transferred at my own request to the Elphinstone High School in Bombay ag 6th assistant on Rs. 75 in April 1907. There were over 40 teachers in that High School and about 750 students from the 4th to the 7th standard. I was made Head Sanskrit teacher (there were three teachers of Sanskrit and 12 classes in Sanskrit). Towards the end of 1907 the post of Assistant to the Professor of Sanskrit at the Poona Deccan College ( on Rs. 125 p. m.) fell vacant and I applied for the post. But I was not appointed and another person who was an M. A. in Sanskrit, but bad won no prize, scholarship or medal in Sanskrit at any examination from the Matriculation to the M. A, and who was 9th Assistant in the Elphinstone High School ( where I was 5th assistant) was appointed to the post, because he was a favourite stadent of the D. P. I. when the latter was Principal of the Decoano College. I sept a protest through the Principal of the High School. I was informed that a competent authority in Sanskrit had reoom mended that the person chosen was superior to me in Sanskrit and when I requested the D. P. I, to let me know the name of the com petent authority I was informed that my letter was an impertinent one aod deserved no reply. This added insult to injury. This happened in December 1907. I decided to appear for the 2nd LL, B. examination in November 1908 and then to leave Govt, service. My supersession created a great deal of oriticism in the Department and almost all persons sympathised with me and helped me in various ways. I appeared for the 2nd LL. B, examination in Novem ber 1908 and passed it. This created an impression in the Education Department that I meant serious business. Therefore, as a sop to my injured feelings, I was appointed to act as Professor of Sanskrit at the Elphinstone College from February to April 1909 in place of Prof. S. R. Bhandarkar who had been depated on some Govt. work. I reverted to the High School at the end of April 1909 and began to cast about where to practise as a lawyer. I was not inclined to practise as a lawyer in subordinate courts and decided that, if I left service, I would practise on the Appellate side of the High court, where it is a battle of wits and of hard work and one bad not to do what a lawyer practising in the subordinate courts had to do. At that time, the late Mr, Daji Abaji Kbare was almost at the top of the Appellate side Bar ( called Vakils of the High Court). He had some large estates at Dapoli (my native place) and knew my father and myself. I approached him for advice. He told me that I must</p>
<p>Epilogio</p>
<p>have with me at least two thousand rupees in cash, if I wanted to practise in the High Court and to stick to it. I had then not &amp; pie with me and my father who was already sixty years old and had to educate other sons, declined to help. In less than two years from June 1909 I brought out two school books and one annotated book in Sanskrit (the Sabityadarpana ) for College students and was also appointed an examiner in Sanskrit at the Previous and Intermediate Arts Examinations. I thus collected two thousand rupees, resigned from Govt, service at the end of June 1911 and applied for a Sanad (after payiog Rs. 500 as fee for enrolment as a Vakil of the High Court of Bombay) with a certificate of good moral character from Mr. Khare and was enrolled as a Vakil of the High Court on 6th July 1911 when I was in my 32nd year.</p>
<p>Work was slow in coming and the first two years were rather bleak. Having not much to do, I appeared for the LL. M. examina tion in Hindu and Mahomedan law in 1912 and passed it. From 1911 to about 1918 I brought out every year some book or books such as the Kādambarī of Bāṇa in three parts with ample notes, the Hargacarita in two parts, and the Uttararāmacarita. I also condoo ted a private law class for coaching stodents for the High Court Vakil&rsquo;s examination (in which 60 percent marks were required for passing). This brought in a steady income of about Rs. 100 per month for four years from 1913 to 1917 and, what was more impor tant, this task of teaching single-handed the vast field of law made me proficient in all complicated legal topics. In the meantime, in 1913 I was appointed Wilson Philological Lecturer to deliver six lectures on Sanskrit, Prakrit and allied languages for a lump sum of Rs. 750. In 1913 I became an ordinary member of the Bombay Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society and a life.member ( by paying &amp; lump sum of Rs. 500) in January 1915. At the beginning of 1915 I was appointed by the Bombay University a Springer Research Scholar for two years on a salary of Rs. 100 per month, the subject of research being Ancient Geography of Mahārāstra&rsquo; (part publish ed in JBBRAS, VOL. XXIV for 1917, pp. 613-657). In 1916 I worked as Honorary Professor of Sanskrit at the Wilson College, when Prof. 8. R. Bhandarkar, who was permanent Professor, fell ill, and I leatured for three hours a week to B. &amp;. classes on the most difficult part of Rāmānuja&rsquo;s Bhāṣya on Vedāntasātra.</p>
<p>In 1917 June I was appointed as a Professor of Law in the Govt.</p>
<p>Vi</p>
<p>Ristory of Dharmasastra</p>
<p>Law College at Bombay. This was again a case of an unexpeoted event. The Chief Justice of the Bombay High Court had recom mended for a vacancy in the law college two names from among the Vakils on the Appellate side Bar of the High Court, one a very senior gentleman and myself who had less than six years&rsquo; practice. The senior gentleman for some reason (not given out) refused at the lust moment and on 20th June, the day on which the Law College was to open, I receired a wire in the Vakil&rsquo;s room from Government stating that Gort, proposed to appoint me as a Professor of Law from that day and that if I agreed I should see the Principal. This was a comfortable job, the salary being Rs. 350 a month and tbe duties light viz. three or four hours per week in the evening from 5-45 p.m. to 6-45 p. m. I was Professor of Law for six years ( 1917-1923). Hardly any Vakil with less than six years' practice on the Appellate Side of the High Court had bee) appointed before me as Professor of Law.</p>
<p>I had undertaken about 1911 an edition of the Vyavahāra mayūkha with explanatory notes on the advice of Prof. S. R. Bhad darkar who was one of the General Editors of the Bombay Govt&rsquo;s Sanskrit Series. But, owing to fluctuations in my own fortunes, I had neglected the work and had almost decided to give up the under taking altogether. The Bombay Govt.&rsquo;s Sanskrit Series came to be transferred by Govt. to the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute that had been started in Poona in 1917. The authorities of the Institute pressed me to carry out my undertaking. I agreed and began to read the vast Dharmaśāstra Literature for that purpose. The edition of the Vyavabāramayūkba of Nilakantha (text based on three printed editions and eight mss., an Introduction of 47 pages and exhaustive notes ) was published in 1926 by the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, Poong. In the brief Preface to that edition of 1926, I announced that I bad undertaken to write the History of Dharmaśātra Literature,</p>
<p>Dr. R. G, Bhandarkar had expressed a desire to donate bis large library of thousands of books to some Institute that would properly house them, take care of them and make it a centre of Sanskrit studies, Dr. Belvalkar, Dr. Gude and several others suppor ted the idea and about thirty people including myself contributed Rs. 500 each for the purchase of a big vacant plot of 30 acres in Poona and, after setting aside nearly half of the purchased plot forEpilogue</p>
<p>VII</p>
<p>the Institute to be named after Dr. R. G. Bhandarkar, distributed the rest among the original contributors as plot-holders. The public and Govt, supported the Institute and the famous Tatas donated money to construct a suitable building. The first project undertaken</p>
<p>was the publication of the critical edition of the Mahābhārata. Gort. made grants, transferred the Bombay Sanskrit Series to the Institute, the Chief of Aundh promised a lakh of rupees for the Mahābhārata edition with pictares and later the Nizam of Hyderabad contributed a large som for building a guest-house for scholars from India and abroad.</p>
<p>The first volume of the History of Dharmaśāstra, which was published in 1930, deals with the chronology and relative importance of famous and less known writers and works and covers 760 pages. As I regarded myself as one of the original founders of the B. O. R. I. and as I was a sacoessful lawyer on the Appellate side of the High Court, I offered the volume to that Institute for publication without any agreement about payment. The Preface to the first volume makes it clear that I intended to finish the whole history in two volumes and that even at that time I suffered from a painfal complaint ( daodenal ulcer) which has dogged my footsteps throughout up to this day. The second volume of the History of Dharmasastra covering 1368 pages (including about 300 pages on Śrauta ritual, not included in the original plan) was published in June 1941 ( i. e. eleven years after the publication of the first volume), when I was already 61 years old and pursued by an impla cable ailment. The third volume containing 1088 pages was published in October 1946 and deals with only three topics &ldquo;Rājadharma, Vyavabāra, and Sadācāra' (customs and customary law). On account of the 2nd world war there was paper shortage and the finances of B, O. R. I. were at a low ebb. I had therefore to advance three thousand rupees to the B. O. R. I, and had to purchase paper worth several hundred rapees for expediting the printing, in view of the fact that I was in my 67th year and that my physical condition was causing anxiety. The 4th volume is spread over 926 pages, was published in October 1953 ( when I was in my 74th year) and deals with Pātaka ( sins ), Prāyaśoitta (expiation), Karmavipāka ( fruition of evil deeds ), Antyesti (rites on death), Atanoe ( impurity on death and birth ), Suddhi ( purifioation ), Sraddha, Tirthayātrā ( pilgrimages to sacred places ).</p>
<p>VIII</p>
<p>History of Dharmaścīstra</p>
<p>The (fifth and ) last volume deals with numerous topios, as the Table of Contents will show. The first part of 718 pages dealing with Vrata ( sacred pows, observances and festivals) and Kala vas separately published in 1958 ( as I had then an attack of heart trouble, and it was thought that I might not survive, being more than 78 years old at that time). The second part now printed deals with Santis, Purāṇas in relation to Dharmasastra, causes of the disappearance of Buddhism from India, Tantras and Dharnalastra, Sāṅkhya, Yoga, Tarka and Dharmaśāstra, Pūrvamimārisā and Dharmaśāstra, Cosmologs, doctrine of Karma and Punarjanta, dominant characteristics of our Indian culture and civilization and future trends. This volume has been in the press for over five years and has involved an enormous amount of varied reading and writing for over eight years from 1953.</p>
<p>In describing how and in how many years the H, of Dh, deve loped, I have not said anything about the environment in which I had to Tork. From about 1918 I began to have good work as a lawyer. I not only conducted cases in the Bombay High Court, but I appeared before the District Courts of the wofussil in several districts such as Khandesli, Nagar, Poona, Sholapur, Satara, and Ratnagiri. I owe a great deal to my college friends, to my students that passed the High Court Vakil&rsquo;s examination after attending any private law class and to Mr, MK. Atbaple of Sangli and Mr. C. M, Saptarishi of Ahmednager for sending me much legal work.</p>
<p>I took part in many of the intellectual activities in Bombay and Poona. I was a member of the Senate of the Bombay Univer sity from 1919 to 1928, I have been throughout a member of the Regulating Council of the Bhandarkar Institute and of its other bodies. I was closely connected for over 40 years with the Marathi Granthasangrahālaya of Bombay in various capacities and with the Brāhmaṇasabha of Bombay in many capacities as Chairman of the Managing Committee, a Trustee for 21 years and Adviser from</p>
<p>1918 to this day.</p>
<p>I had argued gratis several cases for some societies and indivi duals. Mr. Jaydekar, lawyer of Dhulia, espoused the cause of people who had grievances against the Indian Railways, I conducted many such railway cases and cases of poor and helpless people, One of these latter was that of a poor untonsured brāhmaṇa widow who had been prevented by the priests in the temple of Vithoba at Pandharpur</p>
<p>Epilogue</p>
<p>IX</p>
<p>from offering worship to the image by placing her head at the feet of the image ( because she was untunsured ) as all Hindus, male or female, of all castes were allowed to do. I had to go to Pandharpur thrice at my own expense and spent in all seven days in court. The court decided in favour of the widow. The case is referred to in the History of Dharmaśāstra, vol. II p. 593 and the arguments are set out on pp. 587–593 of the volume.</p>
<p>Another case that I conducted gratis is that of the Deccan College, Poona. This College was started by Govt. bat a Parsi Baronet, Sir Jamsetji, made in the early sixties of the 19th century a munificent donation of about two lakhs with the stipulation that it was to be maintained as an educational Institution for ever on the lines already laid down. The British Govt. on the suggestion of an Indian Minister wanted to close the College and made a contract for sale of the site and buildings for a Parsi Public School. Some of the Old Boys of the College such as Prof, S. G. Sathe and Dr. Belyalkar consalted me what to do, though I was not an old boy of the Deccan College. I first suggested that a member of the Bombay Legislative Council should ask a question whether the Deccan College was not an Institution held in trust by Govt. The Gort, replied that it was a trust property, but that Govt. would approach the Distriot Court of Poona for permission to sell it for the purpose of a public school. Govt. applied to the District Court at Poona for permission to sell it for the purpose of a public school. I appeared for the old Boys' Association and requested that the Association should be made a party to Govt&rsquo;s application, The Court allowed the application. I had agreed not to charge any fees. I suggested that Mr. M. R. Jayakar, who had a great regard for me and was a very successful advocate in Bombay ( who later became a member of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in England ), shonld be briefed in the matter. The Association said that they had not money enough to pay Mr. Jayakar&rsquo;s heavy fees. I requested Mr. Jayakar not to charge any fees. He complied with my request and the whole case took about 15 working days in court, besides many days of prepara tion, Mr. Jayakar, having once agreed to work without fees, put his heart and soul in the matter and the District Court in a long judgement of about ninety typed pages held that the Deccan College was a trust and could not be sold. Govt. went in appeal to the High Court of Bombay, but by that time a popular Ministry with the</p>
<p>History of Dharnuaśastra</p>
<p>late Mr. B. G. Kher as Chief Minister had come to power and compromised the matter by agreeing to conduct the Deccan College as a Research Institote for Vedic studies and classical Sanskrit, Ancient Indian History etc. The Association made Mr. Jayakar and myself Honorary members of the Old Bugs' Association. I have been on the Managing Council of the Deccan College Research Institute since 1938 to this day.</p>
<p>In 1944 I was appointed by the Bombay University Sir Lallabhai Shah Lecturer aod delivered four lectures on Hindu customs and modern laws. The lectures have been published in book form by the University.</p>
<p>In 1927 at thr time of the Ganapati festival in Bombay, a mela (Party of worshippers) of the Mahar caste (held untouchable) approached the authorities of the Brāhınanasahhi for permission to come for darśan of thr image installed by the Sabhā and stated that they would be content if they were allowed to come as near the image as Parsis, Christians and Moslems would be allowed to do. I was then Chairman of the Janaging Committee and called a meeting of the Committee to decide whether the request should be granted. In the Committee the voting was exactly half for and half against. I had to give a casting vote for granting permission, since I was of the opinion that the request was a very modest one and in view of the changing times should be acceded to. A suit was filed in the Bombay High Court by certain orthodox people against the Brāhmanasabhā, against myself as Chairman of the Manag ing Committee and the Secretary for a temporary injunction res training us from bringing the Mahar Mela jaside the building where the image was and for a declaration that the Sabbā through its office-bearers had no right to do what had not been pre vionsly done, It must be said to the credit of the members of the Sabhā that in a meeting of the general body of members my action was supported by &amp; pery large majority. There was great excitement and it was feared that violence might result. The High Court retased io grant a temporary injunction and later the suit was withdrawn by the members seeking legal relief. Our Constitution bas abolished untoucbability but that was in 1950 and this excite ment arose in 1927.</p>
<p>I have been a member of the Managing Committee of the Bombay Asiatic Society for about 45 years, a Vice-President and one</p>
<p>Epilogue</p>
<p>of the editors of the Journal of the Society for many years. I con tributed many long articles to the Journal of the Society and to the Annals of the Bhandarkar Institute. In 1946 at my request Dr, B. C. Law, a great scholar, whom I had never seen but who had become an admirer of my books, donated Rs. three thousand ( for purchase of books for the Society) and donated five thousand rupees for founding a medal called P. V. Kane Gold Medal to be awarded once every three years to a scholar who had done sabstantial research in subjects in which I was interested.</p>
<p>On 7th May 1941, in honour of my 61st birthday. A volume of studies in Indology' was presented to me edited by Dr. S. M. Katre and Prof. P. K. Gode and published by Dr. N. G. Sardesai of the Oriental Book Agency, Poopa. My friends and admirers had formed a Committee with Dr. V. S. Sukthankar as Chairman and invited papers. Many contributions came in, of which 74 are contained in that work, mostly written by Indian scholars ( a few by scholars from abroad also ).</p>
<p>In 1942 the British Govt. conferred on me the title of Mahd mahopādhyāya and the Allahabad University conferred on me the Honorary Degree of D, Litt. In 1946 I was asked to preside over the All India Oriental Conference held at Nagpur. In 1947 Mr. B, G, Kher, then Chief Minister of the Bombay State, pressed me to become Vice-Chancellor of the Bombay University for two years and I agreed after some hesitation owing to my age ( about 68). There was no salary attached to the post nor was there any sumptuary allowance nor any other allowance. In the years 1947 to 1949 I had three matters on my hands, my legal practice, the History of Dharmaśāstra and the work as Vice-Chancellor ( which was heavy in those days, sometimes three hours a day). Mr. Kber pressed me to remain Vice-Chancellor for three years more, offered to make it a salaried post of 2000 Rs. per month and requested me to give up practice as Advocate. The then Gorernor of Bombay, Sir Maharaj Singh, as Chancellor, also pressed me, but for various reasons ( the foremost being that the work on the History of Dharma tāstra would make slow progress if I spent five or more hours a day in the University ) I declined. The Session of the All India Oriental Conference was held in Bombay in 1949. I was Chairman of the Reception Committee. On my request the Sakuntala of Kālidāsa was performed in Sanskrit with songs, the director being Mr. K.C.M,</p>
<p>XII</p>
<p>Bhatavdekar who is a fine-looking and tall inan, an excellent actor, a good Sanskritist and a singer. It was a great success. Embolde ned by this success I suggested that other Sanskrit drames should be put up on the stage. Mr. Bhatawdekar and Mr. P. P. Joshi, two enthusiastic workers of the Sanskritic Samili (Cultural Committee) of the Brābwanasabbā at Bombay, worked hard and at different times and in different places ( Delhi, Bombay, Ujjain, Poona ) put up on the staye ten Sanskrit dramas, sīkuntula, Mrochakatika, Katnāvali, Venisalihāra, Uttararimacarita, Modrārākṣasa, Vikramorvasiya, Mālavikāgoimitra, Svapnavāsa vadatta and Sangita Saubhadra (tran slated into Sanskrit by Mr.S. B, Velaukur, Indian Postal Service, from the original Marathi by Anna Kirloskar). These performances became very popular. The sale of tichets yielded 150,000 Rs, out of which about thirty thousand were saved after meeting all expenses as a fund to fall back upon when they performed one of these plays at different places.</p>
<p>The International Congress of Orientalists was held in Paris in 1948. The Indian Govt, sent a delegation of three, Dr. 8. Radha krishnan as leader and Dr. S. K, Chatterji and myself as two Dembers. In 1951 the International Congress met in Istanbul and the Indian Govt. sent a delegation consisting of myself as leader ), Dr. R. O. Majumdar and Prof. Siddiqui. At this conference I sponsored a resolution that the Unesco should make a substantial grant to the project of a Sanskrit Dictionary on Historical Principles undertaken by the Decoan College and it was unanimously passed by the Conference and subsequently Unesco made a grant of 5000 dollars to the Deccan College. In 1954 the Session of the Inter pational Congress of Orientalists was held at Cambridge to which the Govt of India sent a delegation consisting of myself ( as leader), Dr. 8. K. Chatterji and Dr. R. N. Dandekar. From Cambridge I went at any own expense to U. 6. A. and visited the Library of the Congregs in Washington for two days, the University of Princeton, Harvard University and the University of Rochester, where may younger son was studying for the Ph. D. degree in Atomio and Nuclear Physios. The Governing Body of the London School of Oriental and African studies of the London University was pleased to nominate me as an Honorary Fellow, I being the only Indias among the present 25 Honorary Fellows of the School. In December 1963 I presided over the session of the Indian History Congress at Waltair.</p>
<p>Epilogue</p>
<p>Xiii</p>
<p>In November 1963 the President of India was pleased to nominate me as a member of Parliament i e. of the Rājyasabhi (Council of States ) and when my term expired on 1-4-58 I was again nominated for six years. While in Parliament I worked on several committees such as the Committees fur considering the Hindu Adoption Act, the Hindu Marriage Act, the Hindu Succession Act. I pressed on the Govt, that they should start a Central Institute of Indian Studies. This has been now accepted in principle and a committee has been appointed to suggest a constitution and other matters. I have also been a member of the Central Sanskrit Board. On 15th August 1958 the President of India was pleased to grant me a certificate of merit and an annuity of Rs. 1500 a year. In August 1959 the President was pleased to nominate me as National Professor of Indology for five years on a substantial salary, the only condition being that I should carry on research as I have been doing. I resigned from Parliament in September 1959, because as I beld an office of profit under Gort, I had to do so according to law. In 1960 the University of Poona conferred on me the Honorary Degree of Doctor of Letters,</p>
<p>From the beginning of 1955 I did not take any fresh legal work and by March 1956 I got all my cases disposed off. Since April 1956 I have systematically refused all pressure to accept briefs. Since April 1956 I have devoted my time to Parliamentary work (till September 1959 only) and to the last volume of the History of Dharmasastra.</p>
<p>I had substantial legal work from 1919 to about 1949. For the benefit of those who made inquiries and of those who desire to pursue literary studies while working as lawyers, I shall briefly state how I saved time for literary work. The High Court worked for five days in the week. I always atilized all holidays for literary work, Saturday and Sanday have always been my busiest days. There were always two Benches ( sometimes three Benches also ) on the Appellate side of the High Court. Often ten appeals were placed on the board for each Bench every day, since the practice of the Court has been that if an Advocate had two matters, one in each of the different courts and he was engaged in one court, his case in the other court was kept back till he became free. So when an advocate had even one appeal in one court and that too very low down in the list, even then he had to be present in court from the beginning, since appeals</p>
<p>XIV</p>
<p>lower down on the Board might be taken up by the Court if the lawyers therein were available, Most lawyers when free spent their time iu chitchat in the Advocates' room. I spent such time in the Library for preparing my briefs that were likely to be taken up in the next few weeks. I hardly ever read my briefs at home. Therefore, I could devote every day some hours in the morning and eveuing to my work on Sanskrit studies. I always worked for eight or pine hours a day and sometimes ten to twelve hours from 1911 to 1948, except when I was not in Bumbay. I bave never slept or even taken a nap ly day from 1904 to 1958; even when I went to see a drama at night and came home at 2 A.V. I awoke at 6 A.M. and slept a little earlier on the following night. After the mild heart trouble in 1958, I tried sleeping a little by day, but not being used to such a thing I gave it up in a few months. For fifty years I have been taking morning walk for about one hour on the Chow pati sea face in Bombay and at the Hanging Gardens since 1912, but stopped going to the Hanging Gardens from about 1956.</p>
<p>That I had duodenal ulcer was discovered by X-ray therapy about 1925. Some doctors advised an operation. Others opposed it, I consulted the then most eminent surgeon in Bombay, Dr. G. V. Deshmukh, and he advised me not to go in for it. Again in 1937 when I undertook a trip in European countries for three months, I consulted in Vienna an eminent German doctor who advised me to continue my dietetic methods and not to undergo an operation, when I was nearly 58 and the disease was of very long standing.</p>
<p>A few words about my method of collecting materials for my . History of Dharmasastra, I have about a bundred pote-booka, some of them subjectwise and some with pages marked from A to Z, in which I noted important pages and passages extracted from the works read. For example, I have a big oblong notebook ( leather bound ) of about 500 pages devoted to Puriṇas only.</p>
<p>As regards the writing of the History of Dharmasastre my method was as follows: I wrote in my own band a first draft, collected a hundred pages or so and then carefully read those pages. Sometimes I tore off several pages and prepared a new draft. I cannot type well, having had no time to cultivate the habit of using a typewriter. Then I got the matter typewritten by an exoellent typist, Mr. G. R. Barve, who was my neighbour and who could decipher my bad writing tolerably well and paid him his usual</p>
<p>Epilogue</p>
<p>XV</p>
<p>charges. I sent to the Press only the handwritten original of the first volume. It was from the 2nd volume onwards that I got one or two copies typewritten (two when there was danger of bombing Bombay in 1942 ) and sometime afterwards I read the typed copy myself and put in the diacritical marks. This was sent to the Press in Poon! I examined three (rarely four ) proofs of all forms myself, but the press had directions to send a oopy of the third page proof to a good Sanskrit scholar in Poona who was to read it and make corrections (not in the matter but only as to diacritical marks, spelling, stops etc. ) and to send the corrected proof to me and I incorporated his corrections (if accepted by me) in my own copy of the third proof, which was sent to the Press as the final proof. The Indexes to all the five volumes were prepared by me. The Indexes to volumes I-IV alone come to 289 pages. The total prin ted pages of all works written and printed by me and of the numerous papers that I contributed to the Journal of the Bombay Asiatic Society, the Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Institute and to other Journals would come to at least twenty thousand pages. To the typewriters of vol. II to V, I paid about 2500 rupees out of my own pocket and about 600 rupees to the correctors of the page proofs (of volume II to V). I went to places that had collections of Sanskrit Mss, such as Poona ( very often ), Baroda, Benares ( several times ), Madras ( several times), Tanjore and Ujjain at my own expense for reading several mss. and getting copies made of a few of them. In our country, there are no large libraries like those in Europe and U. 8. A. So I had to spend money on securing micro-films of certain articles in foreign journals and copies of certain Mog. I have no accounts of the travelling charges but about making copies of some mss, and microfilms I can say that they came to about 200 rupees. The Press was in Poona and I was in Bombay and the proofs ( along with the original copy at the time of the despatch of the first proof ) had to be sent by post for about 30 years ( sometimes one form, sometimes two and rarely three at a time). Besides, the original ms, had always to be sent in small packets (of from 50 to 100 handwritten or typed pages) by registered bookpost. No, accounts are kept of this but probably Rs. 400 would be a very modest estimate. The honorarium paid (and to be paid ) to me</p>
<p>for all the five volumes is given in the table below :</p>

<p>Epilogue</p>
<p>XVII</p>
<p>The usual method in India as regards Histories or Encylo pædias in several volumes ( running into thousands of pages ) is to appoint a Director or Chief Editor (on a salary of Rs. 1500 per month ), an Assistant Editor (op a salary of Rs. 600 or Rs. 750 per month ) and to pay contributors at Rs, five or so per page, beside an office and a staff of clerks and typists. The Director&rsquo;s salary on the usual scale for one year alone would come to Rs. 18,000. The payments made and to be made to me for writing the work of over six thousand pages spread over 37 years come practically to one year&rsquo;s salary for a Chief Editor ( or rather less by Rs. 3700 which were spent for typewriting, correction, and copies eto, as stated above). I do not like this distasteful task. I had, however, to write about this matter because I wanted to dispel the queer notions about my profits that some people appear to entertain and made inquiries. It is owing to one individual&rsquo;s sacribce that all the volames ( containing over 60C0 pages) can be sold by the Bhandarkar Oriental Institute for only Rs. 180. If the usual method had been followed, these 6000 pages would have had to be priced at Rs. 400 or more.</p>
<p>I could not arrange or plan my life. I had to oscillate bet ween education, literature and law, between Government service and an independent profession like that of law, I have, however, lived a very active, full and varied life for over sixty years. Thinking over the vast Sanskrit literature and the labour and time that I had to spend on one branch of it, I am inclined to close this Epilogue with two lines from Browning&rsquo;s poem “ The last ride together&rdquo;</p>
<p>Look at the end of the work, contrast The petty done, the undone vast.'</p>
<p>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS AND THANKS</p>
<p>During the last thirty-seven years from 1926 to this day I have received from hundreds of friends and others, institutions and books, assistance of various kinds. Now that this undertaking is drawing to a close, I should like to mention with gratitude all of theo that I can remember. In the Prefaces to the several volumes of this History I have acknowledged the help received from individuals in writing the separate volumes. Here at the end of the whole work,</p>
<p>XVIII</p>
<p>I shall try to mention in one place the Institations, the series of books and individuals to whom I have been indebted,</p>
<p>INSTITUTIONS</p>
<p>Among Institutions the first place must be assigned to the Library of the Bombay Asiatic Society (formerly called Bombay Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society ). It was in this Library that I passed several hours almost every day (except on holidays ), when I was in Boinbay. It has also a large collection of Sanskrit Mgs. The materials for the first four volumes were collected mainly in the rooms of this Library. I owe a deep debt of gratitude to this Library and to all persons in the service of the Library from the highest to the lowest, I must bext mention the Library of the Bombay University, which was also of great use to me, The Library of the Bombay Asiatic Society is a circulating Library with a large membership, but the Bombay University Library permits only the members of the Senate to have books issued to them for reading at home. I could secure books urgently needed by me from this Library, when I could not get them from the Asiatic Society&rsquo;s Library ( because some members had taken them ). Besides, it possesses a large number of Sanskrit Mss. I tender my thanks to the Bombay University and its Library, to the staff of the Library and particularly to Mr. D. N. Marshall, the present Librarian, Since November 1353 when I was nominated a member of Parliament (Rājyasabhā) by the President of India, two more Libraries became available to me. One was the Library of Parliament which contains a large number of books on many subjects including Sanskrit Litera ture, Ancient Indian History, and the Library of tbe Archaeological Department in New Delhi. I thank the staff of the Parliament Library. Dr. A. Ghosh, Director-General of the Archaeological Survey of India, made special arrangements for seating me in the Archaeological Library and made me a corresponding member, Dr. Chabbra, Joint Director of that Department, also was very kind and helpful. I am under great obligations to these high Officers. When at the end of 1953, I went to the Library of the Archaeologioal Department, the Librarian was a young man, Shri L. G. Parab, a double M, A, of the Bombay University, &amp; B.T. and holder of a diploma in Librarianship. He is a very industrious and enthusi astic young Librarian, who made great efforts to keep the Library</p>
<p>Epilogue</p>
<p>XIX</p>
<p>full of Sanskrit books, full of books both on ancient and medieval history of India and of other countries, and of books on all archae logical studies, such as architecture, iconography and painting, kept the Library uptodate and took a keen interest in my work and a great deal of trouble to accommodate me in various ways ( too many to mention ) from 1954 to the present day. Much of the material for this lengthy 6th volume was collected in the Archaeological Library and a good deal of the text also was written there, I am under a deep debt of gratitude to Mr. Parab and also thank all bis assistants, particularly Messrs. Kapur and Mr. A. 8. Dhavle and his Jamadar, Bhagavat Sabai.</p>
<p>Then I most mention certain Series of books and certain Presses that have printed and published a large number of books, such as the Anandāśrama series (Poona), the Bibliotheca Indica Series the Bombay Sanskrit Series, the Kāvgamālā and the Nirnayasāgar Press, Calcutta Oriental Series, Chowkhamba 8. Series, Cultural Heritage of India, volumes I-IV (Calcutta), the Gujarati Press and its Sanskrit Series, the Gaikwad Oriental Series (Baroda ), Haridas Sanskrit Series (Benaras ), Harvard Oriental Series, Kashi Sanskrit Series, Jivanand Vidyasāgar&rsquo;s numerous pablications, Prājāapatha. fālā Mandala&rsquo;s volumes of Dharmakośa and Mimārsā-kośa ( Wai), Kashmir Sanskrit Series, the Manikyachandra Digambar Jain</p>
