<h3 id="preface">Preface</h3>
<p>PREFACE</p>
<p>It is a little over ten years since the first volume of my History of Dharmaśāstra was published. In the preface to that volume I expressed the hope that time and health permitting I might issue in a few years the second volume dealing with the development of the various subjects comprised in Dharmaśāstra, For several years thereafter whatever leisure I could seouro from professional work was devoted to the collection and orderly assortment of the vast Literature on Dharmasastra. After my return from a few months' visit to Europe in 1937 I commenced the work of writing the second volume. It soon became apparent to me that to compress within the limits of a single volume the development of the thousand and one topios that fall within the purview of Dharmaśāstra would present only a sorappy and faint outline of the whole field. To add to the difficulties of my task my old painful complaint ( duodenal ulcer) recurred with far greater virulence than before, so much so that, partly on medical advice and partly out of despair, in October 1938 I gave up the work altogether. When relief did not come even after six months' total abstinence from literary labours I resumed, in spite of my extremely painful complaint, the work of writing, for fear that otherwise the extensive materials that I had been collecting for nearly two decades might be entirely lost to the world of Sanskrit scholars and that my labours might be altogether wasted. Being afraid that my strength and resolu tion may not last till the completion of the rather ambitious undertaking, I decided upon bringing out in two volumes the development of the various subjects comprised in Dharmaśāstra. The present volume contains the treatment of varna and Aśrama, the samskāras, āhnika and acāra, dāna, pratiṣtha and utsarga, and srauta (vedic) sacrifices. The next volume (the last) will deal with the following topics: vyavahāra (Law and procedure), āśauca (impurity on birth and death), sraddha, prāyasoitta, tirtha, vrata, kāla, sānti, the influence of the Pūrva. mimams. and other sāstras on Dharmaśāstra, customs and usages modifying Dharmasastra, the pbilosophical background of Dhermaśāstra, and future developments in Dharmasastra. Looking to my past performance I am unwilling to make any promise about the time when the next volume may be</p>
<p>I. D. A</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>History of Dharmaśāstra</p>
<p>expected to be published. I may state, however, that in view of the fact that at present I am in much better health than I have been for several years I shall try to publish it in three years more.</p>
<p>Excellent works dealing with distinct topics of Dharmaśāstra have been given to the world by eminent scholars. But so far 88 I know no writer has yet attempted single-handed to survey the whole field of Dharmaśāstra. From that point of view this volume partakes of the nature of a pioneer undertaking. It is therefore to be expected that such an ambitious project will manifest the defects of all pioneer work. The circumstances (adverted to above) in whioh this work had to be written and the great hurry with which it had to be rushed through are other factors that are responsible for the awkward or obscuro expreso sions and the errors that it may contain. I mention these matters for lessening the surprise that such blemishes might lead my friends to feel and not for blunting the edge of adverse criti oism. The critic is certainly entitled to mercilessly criticizo the work for its shortcomings and mistakes. Some readers may complain that the present work is prolix, while others may say that the space devoted to several topics is meagre,</p>
<p>I have tried to pursue a middle course.</p>
<p>There was great temptation throughout this work to com. pare ancient and medieval Indian oustoms, usages and beliefs as disclosed by dharmaśāstra works with those of other peoples and countries. But I have tried to omit, as far as possible, such comparisons. Whenever I indulge in them I do so for several reasons. It is the fashion among many writers, both European and Indian, to hold the caste system and the dharma. bāstra view of life responsible for most of the evils from which India suffers at present. To a very large extent I do not subscribe to that view. I have endeavoured to show that human nature being the same in essentials throughout the world, the same tendencies and evils manifest themselves in all countries, the game abuses prevail and the same perversions of originally beneficent institutions take place everywhere and anywhere, whether partioular countries or societies are within the grip of the caste system or any other casteless system. Undoubtedly the caste system has in fact produced certain evils, but it is not singular in this respect. No system is perfect and immune from evil effeots. Though I have been brought up in the midst of the Brahmanical system, I hope it will be conceded by scholara</p>
<p>Preface</p>

<p>that I have shown both sides of the picture and that I have endeavoured to write with detachment.</p>
<p>A few words must be said about the extensive quotations from Sanskrit works and the references to modern Indian Legis lation and case-law. For those who cannot read English (most pandits and sāstris do not) the quotations will be of great help in understanding at least the trend of the arguments. Besides Indian scholars are as a class poor and cannot afford to pur chase numerous books. Nor are there many good libraries in India where all works of reference can be had. For all these reasons thousands of quotations have been cited in the footnotes. The quotations are mostly drawn from published works and references to mss. are few and far between. I hope that the numerous quotations will not intrude themselves on the atten tion of those who want to read only the English portion of the work. Legislative enactments and case-law have been referred to for showing that many regulations of dharmaśāstra are still very much alive, that they govern the every-day life of Hindus and permeate all classes of Hindu society in spite of the fact that a considerable part of dharmaśāstra has become obsolete. Similar remarks apply to the numerous references to inscriptions on stone and copper. These latter serve to prove that rules laid down in the dharmaśāstra were throughout two thousand years observed by the people and enforced by kings and that such rules were not mere precepts composed by</p>
<p>dreamers or scholastio pedants.</p>
<p>I acknowledge with great pleasure that I am under deep obligations to many predecessors and workers in the same and other fields and to many friends. Among the works to which I had to refer constantly and from which I derived the greatest benefit I must specially refer to the following: Bloomfield&rsquo;s Vedio Concordance, the Vedio Index of Professors Macdonell and Keith, the Sacred Books of the East edited by Max Müller (vol. II, VII, XII, XIV, XXV, XXVI, XXIX, XXX, XXXIIII, XLI, XLIII, XLIV). As I was handicapped by the fact that I know little German and less French, I could not fully utilise all the work done by modern European scholars. I am highly obliged to Paramahamsa Kevaldnanda Svāmi of Wai for constant help and guidance (particularly in the srauta portion); to Chintaman gāstri Datar of Poona for assistance in the chapter on darga. pārṇamāsa and for carefully going through the other chapters on srauta; to Mr. Keshav Lakshman Ogale for his work on &amp;iv</p>
<p>History of Dharmasastra</p>
<p>portion of the Index ; to Tarkatirtha Raghunāthasastri Kokje for reading through the whole work and suggesting additions and emendations.</p>
<p>Besides, assistance in various ways during the progress of the work for over three years was very kindly rendered by a host of friends, among whom I should like to make special mention of Prof. H. D. Velankar, Prof. Rangaswami Ayyangar Prof. P. P. S. Sāstri, Dr. Alsdorf, Mr. Bhabatosh Bhattacharya, Mr, N. G. Chapekar, Mr. G. H. Khare, Mr. N. O. Bapat, Pandit Rangacharya Raddi, Mr. L. S. Dravid (a Sāmavedi of Poona), Pandit S. D. Satavlekar, Mr. P.K. Gode. Thanks are due to all these and other friends for their help and interest in this volume, I must state, however, that I alone am responsible for the views and mistakes contained in this work.</p>
<p>In &amp; work containing thousands of quotations and refe rences it is very likely that many slips have oocurred. Besides it is very much to be regretted that several misprints have crept into the footnotes by the loss or displacement of dots and other loose parts of Sanskrit letters in the process of printing.</p>

<p>HISTORY OF DHARMAŚĀSTRA</p>
<p>VOLUME II</p>
<p>CHAPTER I THE TOPICS OF DHARMAŚĀSTRA Manifold are the topics that have been inoluded under Dharmasastra from very ancient times. The Dharma-sutras of Gautama, Baudhāyana, Apastamba and Vagiṣtha deal in greater or less detail principally with the following subjects: the several warnas (classes ), āśramas (stages of life ), their privileges, obligations and responsibilities; the samskāras performed on an individual (from garbhadhāna to antyeṣti ); the duties of the brahmacārin (the first asrama); anadhyāyas (holidays on which Vedic study was stopped); the duties of a snātaka ( one who has finished the first stage of life); vivāha ( marriage ) and all matters connected therewith ; the duties of the grhastha ( house-holder&rsquo;s stage); sauca ( daily purification of body ); the five daily yajñas; dāna ( gifts ); bhakṛyūbhakṣya ( what food should one partake of and what not); $uddhi ( puri. fioation of persons, vessels, clothes &amp;o.); āśauca (impurity on birth and death); antyeṣti ( rites on death ); $rāddha ( rites performed for the deceased ancestors and relatives ); stridharma ( special duties of women ) and stripurdharma ( duties of husband and wife ); dharmas of ksatriyas and of kings ; vyava. hāra (judioial procedure, and the sphere of substantive law suoh as crimes and punishments, contracts, partition and inheritance, adoption, gambling &amp;o.); the four principal classes, mixed castes and their proper avocations; āpaddharma ( actions and avocations permitted to the several castes in extreme diffioulties); prāyascitta (sins and how to expiate them); karmavipāka ( results of evil deeds done in past lives ); sānti (rites on the happening of portents or for propitiating the planets &amp;o.); duties of vānaprastha (forest hermit ) and sarnyāsin ( ascetio). All these subjects are not treated in any fixed or settled order in the sūtra works. To take only one example, the subject of partition and inheritance ocours at the end of the dharmasūtra of Gautama, while Vasiṣtha places the same subject in the middle of his work (17th ohapter) and Apastamba deals with those topios after inishing</p>
<p>History of Dharmaśāstra</p>
<p>1 Oh. I</p>
<p>three-fourths of his work (in II. 6.14). Burther, some works on dharmasastra give very elaborate treatment of certain topios of whioh only faint traces are found in the ancient dharmasutras and metrical smptis. Such topios are vratas ( which may be looked upon as extensions of the subject of gifts ), utsarga and pratiṣthā (dedication of works of public utility and of temples and shrines), tirtha (sacred places and pilgrimages to them), kāla ( auspicious times, festivals &amp;o.).</p>
<p>A glance at the above list will convince anyone how the conception of dharma was a far-reaching one, how it embraced the whole life of man. The writers on dharmaśāstra meant by dharma not a creed or religion but a mode of life or a code of conduct, which regulated a man&rsquo;s work and activities as &amp; member of society and as an individual and was intended to bring about the gradual development of a man and to enable him to reach what was deemed to be the goal of human existence.</p>
<p>From this standpoint various divisions of dharma were suggested. Dharma was divided into srauta and smārta. The first comprised those rites and ceremonies with which the Vedic Sanhitās and Brāhmaṇas were chiefly concerned, such as con secration of the three sacred fires, the Full moon and New moon sacrifices, the solemn soma rites &amp;o. The smārta comprised those topics that were specially dealt with by the smrtis and that concerned the various classes and stages of life. The present work will concern itself principally with smārta dharma and śrauta dharma will be dealt with concisely in an appendix. Some works divide dharma into srauta (Vedio), smārta (based upon smrtis) and siṣtācāra (the actions of the respected in society ). This classification is based on the three sources of dharma viz., fruti, smpti and śiṣtācāra, as observed by Baudha. yana. Another and more comprehensive classifioation says that dharma is sixfold, viz. dharma of Varnas (injunctions based on varna alone such as &lsquo;a brahmapa should never drink wine&rsquo; or &lsquo;a br&amp;bmana should not be killed&rsquo;), āśramadharma</p>

<p>(such rules as &lsquo;begging&rsquo; and ' carrying a staff &lsquo;enjoined on a brahmacarl&rsquo;), varnāśrama-dharma (rules of conduot enjoined on a man because he belongs to a partioular class and is in a particular stage of life, such as a brāhmaṇa brahmacāri should carry &amp; staff of palasa tree ), gunadharma ( such as proteotion of subjects in the case of a crowned king), naimittika dharma (such as expiation on doing what is forbidden ), sādharana dharma ( what is common to all humanity viz., ahiinsā and other virtues ). This olassification appears to have been an ancient one. Medhātithi on Manu II, 25 speaks of fivefold dharma (only omitting sūdhārana dharma from the abovementioned six ) and quotes the explanations of them from the expounders of smśtis. Hemadri ( vrata-khanda p. 5) quotes 16 verses from the Bhaviṣyapurāṇa on the six-fold dharma. It will be noticed from the above that all matters (except sādhārana or sāmānya dharma) have vurga and āśrama as the pivots round which the whole of dharmaśāstra revolves. It is therefore that in anoient smrtis like those of Manu (I. % and 107) and Yājāavalkya (1.1) the sages are represented as asking the great expounders of those codes to impart to them instruction in the dharmas of varnas and asramas.</p>
<p>Before embarking upon any treatment of varṇas it would not be out of place to say a few words about dharmas common to all humanity. Our dharmasastra works do not enter into any subtle or detailed examination of the principles of ethios or of the moral standard, nor are the concepts of duty, happi. ness or perfection subjected to any searching analysis, But</p>

<p>this does not at all mean that the principles of ethics were passed over by dharmaśāstra works or were not highly thought of by them. From very ancient times truth is exalted above everything else. Rgveda VII. 104.1% says? &lsquo;True speech and</p>
<p>(Continued from last page) this hypothosis in well-knowny works on Ethics. To expose the fallacies in Principal MoKenzie&rsquo;s work would requiro a volume. But a fow words must be said here. What particular brand of active social servioo the learnod author has in viow is difficult to follow. I would like to make bim a present of the following lines from the Encyclo pædia Britannica on Social Service The term social service is a comparatively now ono in Great Britain. If it bad been used previous to the 20th century it would bave meant philanthropy and charity in the ordinary senso&rdquo;. If the learned author means that ancient India never insisted on universal philantbropy and charity, he has read the Indian Literature in vain. Every house-holder was called upon by the Hindu Sastras to offer food according to his ability to studente, ascetics and to all beings including the untoucbable candalas and even dogs and crows. Every brahmana who could teach had to do 80 without demanding any foo beforehand. Maths were establisbed in all parts of India for oxpounding religious books, feeding students and the poor. Thero aro annaðatras even now where hundreds are fed every day. No necessity arose throughout the ages for a Poor Law in India with its attendant evils well portrayed in Dickens&rsquo; famous master-piece Oliver Twist'. The above were some of the different aspects of philanthropy and charity which are now dubbed social service. In the third century B. C. Asoka had established bospitals not only for men but evon for beasts and Yaj. 1.209 equates the free qursing of sick persons with gifts of cows. The learned Professor asks with an air of triumph and condemnation of all Indian morality (p. 251 ) &ldquo;Is there anything oomparable to the movement which 8t. Francis of Assisi initiated and lod?' The learned Professor has fallen into the frequent error of comparing &amp; move mont of the 18th contury.with Indian ideas over 2000 years old. Again I shall quote words from the Encyolopædia Britannica. &ldquo;It would bo an anachronism to think of Francis as a philanthropist or social worker or &amp; rovivalist preacher, though ho fulfilled the functions of all these. Before every thing he was a ascetic and mystic'. The partioular brands of Social Service that are now in vogue are mainly due to the ravages of Imperialiam and extreme capitalistic tondenoios. Besides ho forgots that ayon tbe movement started by St. Francis bad schisms and was guilty of all the moral evils that are associated with Western monastio institutions.

<p>false speech run a race against each other. Soma protects out of the two what is true and what is very straight-forward and strikes down what is false'. The conception of sta in the Rgveda is a sublime one and is the germ of the later doctrine of the rule of dharma. The Satapatha-brahmana (8. B. E. vol. 44 p.85 ) enjoins &lsquo;therefore let a man speak naught but truth&rsquo;s. In the Taittirlyopaniṣad (I. II. 1 ), the teacher when taking leave of his pupil at the end of the latter&rsquo;s studenthood places truth in the forefront of his exhortation and dharma next. In the Chandogya (III. 17) there is an allegory of a Soma sacrifice on life, where the dakṣiṇā ( fee to be paid ) is fivefold viz. the five virtues of tapas ( asceticisi), dāna (charity ), arjava (straightforwardness ), abinsā (non-injury to sentient beings ), satyavaoana ( truthfulness ). The Bļ. Up. remarks that truth and dharma are in practical life identical terms. 10 One of the noblest prayers in all literature oocurs in the Bṛ. Up. (I. 3.28) * from falsehood lead me unto truth, from darkness lead me unto light, from death lead me unto immortality&rsquo;. The Mundakopaniṣad says &lsquo;only truth is viotorious and not falsehood; the path of the gods is spread out by (the pursuit of) truth&rsquo;. The Bf. Up. inculoates on all the great need of three cardinal virtues, viz. self-restraint, dayā (compassion or love for all sentient life ) and dāna ( gifts or charity ).&rdquo; The Chan. Up. says that the world of Brahman is free from all evil and only those who have lived as chaste students can enter the world of brahma. The Chan. Up. V. 10 sternly condemns five sins, viz, theft of gold, drinking spirits, murder of a brāhmana, defiling of one&rsquo;s guru&rsquo;s bed and association with these, as the greatest sins and in V, 11. 5 A. vapati exultantly declares that in his kingdoin there were no grave sinners.

The Udyogaparva 43.20ff. speaks of the twelve vratas ( vows or rules of conduot) for brahmanas and Versos 22-25 desoribe at great length the characteristics of one who is dānta (self-controlled ). Santi 160 contains an eulogy of dama ( self-control).

The Gautama-dharmasūtra (VIII. 24-26 ) holds that daya ( compassion or love for all beings), kṣānti ( forebearance), anasuya ( freedom from envy ), sauca ( purity of body, speech and thought ), anāyāsa (absence of painful efforts or ambitions ), mangala ( doing what is commended ), akārpanya ( not demeaning oneself before others ), asp?hā (not hankering after sensual pleasures or the possessions of others)&rdquo; are the qualities of the soul and remarks that the person who has these eight qualities realizes non-difference from Brahma and reaches the world of Brahma, though he may not have all the other forty sainskāras, while he who has all the forty samskaras but is not possessed of these eight qualities does not reach the world of Brahma.'

<p>near; look at what is highest, not at what is not highest'. Apastamba Dh. 8. (1. 8. 23. 3-6) calls upon all asramas to ers dicate faults that tend to destruotion and to cultivate the oppo. site virtues (and gives long lists of both). This shows that in the scale of values mere performance of sacrifices and purifica tory and other religious ceremonies ranked according to Gautama and other writers very low and the highest value attached to the moral qualities of the soul. There is no elabo rate discussion of the questions as to why a man should tell the truth or abstain from hiinsī (injury to sentient beings) and cultivate other high moral qualities. But it should not be supposed that no indications whatever are given of the reasons why this should be done. Two principles emerge if we closely examine the texts. In the midst of countless rules of outward conduct there is always insistence on the necessity to satisfy the inner inan (antara-puruṣa ) or conscience. Manu IV. 161 says&rsquo;assiduously do that which will give satisfaction to the antarātman' (inner self ); IV, 239 says &lsquo;No parents, nor wife nor sons will be a man&rsquo;s friends in the next world; but only righteousness.&rsquo; &lsquo;Gods and the inner man mark the sinful acts&rsquo; Vanaparva 207-54 and Manu VIII, 85, 91-92. Vide also Adi parva 74. 28-29, Manu VIII. 86, Anusāgana 2. 73-74. The reason given for cultivating such virtues 88 dayā, ahinsa is based upon the philosophical doctrine of the one Self being immanent in every individual as said in the words &lsquo;tat tvam-asi&rsquo;. This is the highest point reached in Indian metaphysics and combines morality and metaphysics. That doctrine requires us to regard the goodness or badnegs of one&rsquo;s actions from the standpoint of other individuals who will be affected by such actions. Daksa (III. 22) declares &quot; &lsquo;one who desires happiness should look upon another just as he looks upon himself. Happi. ness and misery affect one&rsquo;s self and others in the same way&rsquo;. Devala says that the quintessence of dharma is that one should not do to others what would be disliked by one&rsquo;s self.&quot; There</p>

<p>fore our texto lay down two seats of authority in morals viz., the revealed truth (sruti) that &lsquo;All this is brahma&rsquo; and the inner light of consoience. Another reason for cultivating high moral qualities is found in the doctrine of the goals or ends of human existence (puruṣārtha). From very ancient times they are said to be four, dharma (right conduot ), artha ( economio interests ), kama (satisfaction of sexual, emotional and artistic life ), mokṣa (liberation of the spirit). The last is said to be the supreme end and to be attained only by the few and the vast majority can only place it as an ideal to be attained in the most distant future. As regards the other three, there is a gradation of values. Kāma is the lowest of all and only fools regard it as the only end.&quot; The Mahābhārata says: &ldquo;A wise man tries to secure all three, but if all three oannot be attained, he secures dharma and artha or only dharma if he has a choice of only one from among the three. A man of middling disoi. pline prefers artha to the other two; dharma is the source of both artha and kāma.' The dharmaśāstra writers did not condemn kāma altogether, they recognise that kāma has a place as a motive urging mon to be active but they assigned it a low</p>
<p>place. They recognised that a man shares with lower beings the impulses and emotions of sex, but that the satisfaction of these impulses is of lower values than the moral and spiritual ends proper for a developed human personality and therefore insist that it should be subordinated to artha and dharma. Gautama (IX. 46-47 ) says &lsquo;one should not allow the morning, midday and evening to remain fruitless so far as dharma, artha and kāma are concerned. But among these three one should attach most importance to dharma.&rsquo; Yāj. I. 115 says practioally the same thing. Ap. Dh. S. (II. 8. 20. 22-23) declares that *&amp; man should enjoy all such pleasures as are not opposed to</p>

<p>dharma. In this way one secures both worlds',&rdquo; In the Bhagavadgita (VII. 11) Krsna identifies himself with kama that is not opposed to dharma. Kautilya say880' one may enjoy kāma provided there is no confliot with dharma and artha, one should not lead &amp; life of no pleasures' and then true to his role of a writer on arthaśāstra, he proclaims that his own opinion is that artha is the principal of the three, as dharma and kama both spring from artha.' Manu (II. 224)Blafter setting out several views about which of the three is principal states it as his own opinion that one should strive for all the three, but adds that if artha or kāma is in confliot with dharma one should give up artha or kāma as the case may be. Viṣnu Dh. S. (71.84)and Bhagavata I.2.9 say the same. The Kamasutrasof Vātsgāyana defines the three and says that out of dharma, artha and kama waob preceding one is superior to each following one and that to the king ortha should be the highest goal. This teaching shows that there are proximate ends or motives and ultimate ends or motives, that the ultimate ende are really the most valuable and that the whole teaching of dharmaśāstra points to this that all higher life demands discipline both of body and mind and requires the subjection of lower aims to aims of higher value. Manu II. 4 (like Aristotle in the first sentence of his Politics) says that the end of all activity is some presumed good. Manu further says (V.56) that the natural proclivity of all beings is to hanker after the satisfaction of the common and lower desires of hunger, thirst and sexual gratifica tion and therefore no stress is to be placed on them but on the cessation or curbing of these.

<p>The Mitakṣara on Yāj. I. 1. remarks that ahinsa and other qualities are the dharmas common to all inoluding even cāndalas. The qualities are variously enumerated and emphasis is laid upon different lists in different works. Saṅkhasmrti (I. 5) says that forbearance, truthfulness, self-restraint and purity are common to all varnas. The Mahabharata says that three are the best qualities among all beings viz., absence of enmity, truthfulness and freedom from anger and in another place says that the best vrata ( vow ) for a man is threefold viz., he should feel no enmity ( to others ), should give and should speak the truth. Vasiṣtha ( IV. 4 ) sayses that truthfulness, freedom from anger, generosity, ahiisā (non-injury ) and procreation of offspring are the common dharma ) of all (varnas). Gautams (X. 52 ) says that even the Sūdra has to submit himself to the dharma of truthfulness, freedom from anger and purity (of body and mind). Manu says that ahimsā, truthfulness, no wrongful taking of another&rsquo;s possessions, purity and restraint of ponses are in brief the common dharmas of all varpas. Manu ( IV, 175 ) oalls upon all to take delight in truth, in dharma, in conduct worthy of an arya and in purity. In the 3rd century B. C. the remarkable emperor Asoka inscribed on stone in all parts of his empire the following list of virtues: compassion, liberality, truth, purity gentleness, peace, joyousness, saintli. Dess, self-control; whiob bear a olose reseinblance to Gautama&rsquo;s list and even to a later list of St. Paul (vide Pillar Ediots II and VII in E. L vol. II p. 249 and p. 272). Yaj. (I. 122 ) men tions nine qualities as the means of securing dharma for all (from the brāhmaṇa to the cāndalas).

<p>with others, forbearance, procreation ( of children) from one&rsquo;s wife ( alone ), purity, absence of enmity, straight-forwardness, maintaining persons dependent on one-self-these nine are the duties of all varṇas. The Vāmanapurana says that tenfold dharma is common to all and names these ten as ahiinsā, satya. usleya, dana, forbearance, restraint, quiescence, not demeaning oneself, purity, tapas.98 Hemādri ( vratakhanda pp. 7-8 ) quotes several passages froin the Brahma, Brahmavaivarta and Vispu dharmottara for several sādhārana doarmas (virtues common to all varpag and asramas ). The Viṣnudbarmasūtra enume rates fourteen qualities as sāmānya-dharma.30</p>
<p>The foregoing discussion establishes that all dharmaśāstra writers attached the highest importance to moral qualities and enjoined them upon all with all the emphasis they could command; but as their main purpose was a practical one, viz., to guide people to right acts in everyday life, they dealt more olaborately with the acts, rites and ceremonies that eaoh person had to do with reference to his station in society. They are therefore found principally concerning themselves with varpā. śrama dharma and not with sādhārana dharma (i. e. duties</p>
<p>common to all alike).</p>
<p>Aryūvarta &ndash; One important question that is very much canvassed in works on dharmaśāstra is about the country or territory which should be called āryāvarta or which was a fit habitation for those who called themselves the followers of the Vedio religion. Therefore a few words on this subject would be quite relevant. The Rgveda shows that the centre of Aryan culture in the times of the Rgveda was the land of the seven</p>

<p>rivers, viz. North-West India and Punjab. We find that the rivers from Kubba ( the Kabul river, in Rg. V. 53, 9; 1. 76, 6), Krumu ( the modern Kurram, Rg. V. 53. 9, X. 75. 6), Suvāstu (modern Swat, in Rg. VIII. 19. 37 ), the seven Sindhus ( Rg. II. 12. 12. IV. 28. 1. VIII. 24. 27, X. 43. 3) up to the Yamunā (Rg. V. 52. 17, X. 75.5), the Ganges (Rg. VI. 45.31, X, 75,5 ) and Sarayu ( probably in modern Oudb, in Rg. IV, 30. 18 and V. 53. 9 ) figure in the Rgveda. Among the rivers of the Punjab the following are individually mentioned : Sindhu (Rg. II, 15. 6 he made the Sindhu flow northwards&rsquo;, Rg. V. 53. 9, Rg. IV. 30. 12, Rg. VIII. 20. 25 where reference is made to the medicine in the Sindhu, in the Asikni, in the seas and on mountains ), Asikni (Rg. VIII. 20. 25, X. 75. 5), Paruspl (Rg. IV. 22. 2, V. 52. 9), Vipās and Sutudri ( Rg. III. 33. 1 where their confluence is spoken of ), Vipas alone in Rg. IV. 30. 12, Sutudri alone in Rg. X. 75. 5, Drṣadvati, Apaya and Sara svati ( as very holy in Rg. III, 23. 4), Sarasvati alone (Rg: VII. 95, the whole hymn is addressed to it of which verso % says it springs from the mountains; Rg. VI. 61 is another hymn addressed to it, v. 10 of which says it has seven sisters ), Gomati (Rg. VIII. 24. 30, X. 75, 6), Vitastā (Rg. X. 75. 5). Gradually the Aryans spread southwards and eastwards. The Kathaka S. X. 6 speaks of Kuru-Padoalas. In the Brah maṇas the centre of Aryan activities and culture shifted to the oountries of the Kurus and Paboālas and Kosala-Videhas. For example, the Satapatha Brāhmaṇa remarks that in the lands of Kurupañoalas speech is at its best.&rsquo; In Sat. Br. XI. 4. 1. 1 Uddalaka Aruṇi is called a Kuru-Pañcala brahmapa and contrasted with brahmaṇas of the north ( S. B. E. vol. 44 p. 51 ). Similarly the Kauṣitaki-br. (VII. 6) remarks that those who want to learn (best) speech go northwards or wait upon him who comes from that direction. In the Satapaths we have the story of Videgha Mathava who went beyond the country of Kosala-Videba, crossed the river Sadanirā that came down from the Himalaya, and settled to the east of that river, where the country was &amp; cultivated and civilized one in the times of that work, while in former ages it had been uncultivated (I. 4. 1. 4-17, 8. B. E. vol. 12 pp. 105-106;). Even in the Buddhist</p>

<p>Jatakas we see that being an &lsquo;udicoa brāhmano&rsquo; was a source of great pride ( vide Fiok&rsquo;s work p. 40). The Tai. Br. speaks of the vedi of the gods as being in Kuru-kṣetra.23 Even in the Rgveda itself the country through' which the rivers Dṛsadvati, Apayd and Sarasvati flowed is spoken of as the best spot (vide III. 23. 4). The Tai. Br. says that the Kurupancālas go east in the winter and westwards in the last month of summer. In the times of the Upaniṣads also the Kurupañcāla country appears to have oooupied &amp; pre-eminent place. The Bs. Up. (III. 1. 1.) says that when Janaka, king of Videha, performed &amp; sacrifioe the brāhmaṇas of Kurupañcāl&amp; flooked there in large numbers. Vide also Bṛ. Up. III. 9. 19. The Bș. Up. VI. 2. 1 and Chāndogya V. 3.1 say that Svetaketu went to the assembly of the Pancalas. Kausitaki Br. Up. (IV. 1.) names the countries of Ubinara, Matsya, Kurupaioala and Kādivideha as centres of intellectual activity and in II. 13 refers to two mountains one in the North and the other in the South ( meaning probably Himayat and Vindhya ). According to the Nirukta (II. 2 ), the country of Kamboja was outside the limits of the country of Aryas, though the language spoken there seeins to have been the same. The Mahabhāsya lends support to this and adds that Surāṣtra was not an Arya country (vol. 1, p. 9). In the times of the Dharmasūtras great divergence of opinion prevailed on the question of the location of Aryavarta. The Vasistha dharma'-sūtra says: Aryāvarta is to the east of the disappea rance ( of Sarasvati in the desert), to the west of Kalakavana, to the north of the mountains Pāriyātra and Vindhya and to the south of the Himalaya' It then refers to two more views held by other authors viz., ' Aryāvarta is in the region between the Ganges and the Jumna' and &lsquo;where the black antelope roams about there is spiritual pre-eminence&rsquo;. The Baud. D. S. (I. 1.27) gives the same limits of Aryāvarta as Vasiṣtha,</p>

<p>(Ch. substituting the word vinasana' for &lsquo;adarsa : 35 Patañjali in his Mahabhāṣya defines Aryavarta several times in the same terms as Vasiṣtha does. The Dharmasūtra of Saṅkha-Likhita gives somewhat similar limits by remarking &lsquo;spotless spiritual pre-eminence is to be found (in the country ) to the east of the countries of Sindhu and Sauvira, to the west of the oity of Kampill, to the south of Himalaya and to the north of Pariyatra &lsquo;, 37 The extant Manusmrti ( II. 22 ) makes Aryāvarta coterminos with the whole of India north of the Vindhya by saying that the territory between the Himalaya and the Vindbya and extending up to the eastern and western oceans is known by the wise as Aryāvarta. The second view ( viz. Āryāvarta is the region between the Ganges and the Jumna) oocurs in Beud. Dh. S. (I. 1.28 ). In the Tai. Ar. II.20 special honour is shown to those who dwell between the Ganga and the Yamuna. The third view ( viz. Aryāvarta is the country where the blsok antelope roame about naturally ) is the one given in most smptis. Both Vasistha (I. 14-15 ) and Baud. Dh. 8. (1. 1. 29-30 ) quote an ancient gātha from the Nidāna work of the Bhallavins *to the effect that wherever the black antelope roams about in the country lying between the Sindhu in the west and the rising mountain in the east, there is spiritual pre-eminence. So this view is a very anoient one and probably</p>

<p>Limits of Aryavarta</p>

<p>aroge from some mythological aocount as is indioated by the commentary of Visvarūpa on Yāj. I.2 which quotes &amp; prose passage of the Svetāśvataras &lsquo;Sacrifice became a blaok antelope and wandered over the earth; dharma followed it in its wanderings&rsquo;. This view of the limits of Aryavarta is maintained by Saṅkha ( as quoted by Visvarūpa on Yaj. I.2), Vigṇudharma. gūtra 84.4, Manu II. 23, Yaj. I. %, Samvarta 4, Lagbu-Harita (I. p. 178), Veda-Vyasa (1. 3), Bṛbat-Parāśara (p. 56 ) and several other smṛtis. The Manusmrti (II. 17-24 ) defines Brahmāvarta as the country between the holy rivers Sarasvati and Dṣṣad. vati, says that the traditional mode of conduct observed in that country is called sadācāra, that the countries of Kuruksetra, Matsya, Pañoala and Sarasene are styled Brahmarṣidesa and are slightly less ( in holiness ) than Brahmavarta, that Madhyadeśa is between the Himalaya and the Vindhya and to the east of Vinaśana and to the west of Prayāga, that Aryāvarta is the country between the Himalaya and Vindhya up to the eastern and western oceans, that that territory where the black antelope roams about naturally is the country fit for sacrifices and the countries beyond constitute mlecchadesa, that mon of the three higher varnas should endeavour to</p>
<p>live in these countries (viz. Brahmavarta, Brahmarṣideśa, Madhyadesa, Aryāvarta &amp;c.) while &amp; sūdra, when distressed for his livelihood, may stay in any country whatever. The Viṣnudharmasūtra ( 84. 4) says that the country where the system of the four varpas is not established is to be known as Mlecche country and Aryāvarta is beyond that. This is ex plained by Apararka (p. 5) as follows: one who desires to practise Vedic religion should live in one of the four countries viz. Brahmāvarta and others; if that is not possible, then in a country where there is establishment of the four varnas and the blaok antelope roams about naturally; if both these cannot be had, then one should dwell in a country where at least one of the two (cāturvarnya and black antelope ) is found. The above discussion shows that in very ancient times the country south of the Vindhya was looked upon as beyond the pale of Aryan culture. Baud. Dh. 8. ( I. 1. 31 ) says that the countries of Avanti, Anga, Magadha, Surāsýra, Dakṣiṇāpatha, Upāvit, Sindhu</p>

<p>and Sauvira are of mixed origin (i. e. not of pure Aryan ancestry ), that a person who goes to Arattaka, Karaskara, Pundra, Sauvira, Anga, Vanga, Kalinga and Pr&amp;nūna (9) has to offer a solemn sacrifice like the Sarvaprstha and that for going to Kalinga the prayasoitta is an offering to. Vaibvānara Agni. The Mit, on Yāj. III. 292 quotes a verge of Devala to the effect: that if a man goes to Sindhu, Sauvira, Saurastra, the border lands (or Mleccha countries), Anga, Vanga, Kalinga and Andhra he has to perform the Upanayang sadskāra over again.&quot; The Mit. adds a remark that this is so only if the man goos to these countries for some purpose other than pilgrimage. Gradually however as Aryan culture spread over the whole of what is now called India the view of the sages about the countries pre-eminently Aryan had to be given up. Medhatithi on Manu II. 2% explains that Aryāvarta is so called &lsquo;because Aryas again and again spring up there and because the Mlecchas even if they overrun it from time to time do not abide there for long&rsquo; and then makes the following very sensible observation (on II, 23 ) &lsquo;if a ksatriya king of excellent conduct were to conquer the Mlecohas, establish the system of four Varnas (in the Mlecoha country) and assign to Mlecohas a position similar to that of candālas in Aryāvarta, even that (Mleccha) country would be fit for the performance of saori. fices, since the earth is not by itself impure, but becomes impure through contact (of impure persons or things ).'* As a result of the spread of Aryan culture eastwards and southwards and the frequent invasions of non-Aryan tribes on the north west, the countries on the rivers of the Punjab came to be looked upon in the whirligig of time as unworthy of the Aryas to live in. Karnaparva 43. 5-8 abuses those who live on the Sindhu and the five rivers of the Punjab as Impure and dharmabahya.&quot;</p>

<p>Another word whiob is very often used, particularly in the Puranas, to denote the territory where the ancient Vedio reli glon prevails is Bharatavarṣa or Bhāratavarṣa. It occurs in the Hathigumpha Insoription of Khāravela (2nd century B.C.) as Bharadhavasa.48 The Mārkandeyapurāṇa says that Bharatavarṣa has the ocean on the east, south and west and the Himalaya on the north.t The Visnupurana (II. 3.1) says the same and Matsya (114.10 ) and Vayu define Bharatavarsa as stretching from Cape Comorin to the source of the Ganges.ts Sabara (not later than 5th century A. D.) in his bhāsya on Jaimini (X. 1.35 and 42 ) shows that to him there was unity of language and culture from the Himālaya to Cape Comorin. 46 Paithinasi as quoted in the Paribhasa-prakasa (p.58) says that dharma is fully developed (lit. four-legged ) in the country from the Himalaya to Cape Comorin. According to Markandeya (53.41), Vayu (vol. I chap. 33.52) and other Purāṇas Bharatavarṣa is so called after Bharata, son of Rsabha, descendant of Svayambhuva Manu%3; while Vāyu ( vol. II, chap. 37.130 ) appears to strike a different note by saying that Bharatavarṣa is so called after Bharata, the son of Duṣyanta and Sakuntala. The Viṣnupurāṇa saya that after thousands of births a person secures life as &amp; human being in Bharatavarṣa and this land is called Karmabhūmi ( the land of religious actions ) for those who want to secure heaven and final liberation. The Vāyupurāṇa says almost the same and adds that in no land other than Bharatavarṣa is karma prescribed for mortals. It is somewhat amusing to find that</p>

<p>many of the countries of India that in modern times pride them gelves on being most orthodox are declared by the Aditya-purana ( as quoted in the Smsticandrika ) to be countries unfit for habitation and to be suoh that a stay in them except for pilgrim age entailed loss of caste and prāyssoittag. 49 The Adipurāṇa ( Adityapurāṇa ?) as quoted in the Paribhāṣāprakāśa (p. 59 ) says ' no one, whether a dvija or not, born in Aryāvarta should cross the three rivers, Sindhu, Karmadā (i. e. Karmanisa) or Karatoy: except on a pilgrimage&rsquo; and that if he does so, he should perform the penance of cāndrāyana.</p>

<p>VARŅA</p>
<p>The number of works dealing with the origin and characteristics of the caste system in India is legion. Most of them, however, concern themselves with the detailed des cription of the bewildering variety of castes and subdivisions of castes in modern times and their present religious and social customs and usages. The origin of caste has given rise to great speculation and several schools of thought have arisen. Generally individual authors lay undue emphasis on one element or attach far too much importance to one point in tracing the origin of the caste system and its ramifications, such as race ( Risley ), tribe ( Ibbetson ), occupation ( Nesfield ). The study of the origin and development of caste in India is one of deep and absorbing interest to all students of sociology. A complete and critical examination of the several theories of caste advanced by distinguished authors and a detailed description of the hundreds of castes and suboastes now found in India is far beyond the scope of the present work. For those who want to make a thorough study of the most important works on caste a modest list is given in the footnote below.50</p>

<p>The oaste system has been highly eulogised and also most severely condemned by Western writers. Sidney Low in his * Vision of India' (pp. 262-263, 2nd ed. of 1907 ) speaks of the beneficent aspect of the caste system in the following eloquent passage There is no doubt that it is the main cause of the fundamental stability and contentment by which Indian society has been braced up for centuries against the shocks of politics and the cataclysms of Nature. It provides every man with his place, his career, his ocoupation, bie cirole of friends.

The caste organization is to the Hindu his club, bis trade union, his benefit society, his philanthropic society. There are no work-houses in India and none are as yet needed.' Abbe Dubois, who wrote about 130 years ago after being in close touch with Hindus of all castes for 15 years as &amp; missionary, remarks ( in his work on the character, manners and customs of the people of India, translated into English and published in London in 1817 ) &lsquo;I consider the institution of castes among the Hindu nations as the happiest effort of their legislation ; and I am well convinced that, if the people of India never sunk into a state of barbarism, and if, when almost all Europe was plunged in that dreary gulf, India kept up her head, preserved and ex tended the sciences, the arts and civilization, it is wholly to the distinction of castes that she is indebted for that high celebrity&rsquo; (p. 14 ) and he devotes several pages to the justification of this remark, Maine in his &lsquo;Ancient</p>

Yet gurely these onds might have been attained in a simpler manner and by a loss antagonistic process. The invention of a project so wonderfully elaborate and intricate- &amp; project of bringing into absolute;subjection two hundred millions of the human species by robbing them of their independence, &hellip;&hellip; the invention of a project like this, so prodigious and far-reaching was not needed to accomplish such useful and boneficent ends.

This object was neither more nor loss than to exalt the Brabman, to food his pride and to ininister to his self-will.' Equally sweeping con demnation can be aad has been indulged in as regards feudalism and modern capitalism. Fick (p. 331) entirely scouts the idea that the theory of oustes was invented by the priests. There are soveral fallacios lurking in the above quoted passage of Sherring. In the first place, there is nothing to show that the oaste system was inyonted by any body of persons who could impose their will on a continent. The dystom simply grew up in the lapse of ages. Tho population of Hindus when Sherring wrote may bave been near two hundred millions, but it could not bave been more than &amp; small fraction of that colossal opinber during tho thousands of years that the system bas tourisbod.

These critios igaore the great adaptability of tbe system, whereby it preserved Indian society from social anarchy during ages of foreiga invasions and internecine wars.

<p>that the caste system was an invention, an artificial product, due to the machinations of crafty brāhmaṇas. Every great institution has its extremes of good or evil. This work will endeavour to steer clear of downright and hypercritical con demnation of the caste system due to relying on modern stand points and conditions of society and unthinking adulation thereof. It will try to present and balance facts and though it cannot help passing judgments it will leave the reader free to judge for himself as far as possible. In the present work the discussion will be mostly confined to the evidence of Sanskrit literary monuments, ancient and medieval. An attempt will be made to trace the origin of caste from Vedio times, to exhibit theories of the Dharmasūtrakāras, other smṛtikāras and oom mentators on the subject and to describe the peculiar ceremonies, privileges, duties and responsibilities of Hindu castes 88 gathered from these works in Sanskrit. To discuss the feasibility or desirability of totally destroying the caste system or the ways and means of attaining that end is deemed to be outside the legitimate limits of this volume. It may, however, be expressly stated as the author&rsquo;s opinion, in order to avoid misunderstand ings or fruitless speculations about his personal views, that he does not think that the caste system was an artificial product due to the intrigues, greed and cunning of brābmaṇas, nor does he hold that it is feasible to destroy the whole edifice of the caste system in the near future. In the cities we may find some people taking their food together but the real India is in the villages, where in spite of the loud denunciations of reformers for a hundred years, the restrictions on taking food and inter caste marriages are almost as rigid as they once were. Our efforts must be direoted to wide and rapid spread of literacy among the village people, the diffusion of the idea of one people and one nationality and gradual fusion of small subcastes into larger similar units. We in India have no doubt reached &amp; critical stage in our history when old ideals, institutions and</p>

We bave to decide whether we shall make or be able to make a clean sweep of all old ideals and institutions as so much debris and rubbish or whether while keeping the old ideals and some of the old institutions as founda tions we shall build up a new social order and create and foster new babits of thought and action. It is beyond the scope of the present work to write more on this point.</p>
<p>A sort of caste system based on birth and occupation did prevail in many countries in ancient times as in Persia, Rome and Japan. But in all these countries it hardly ever made any near approach in rigour and complexity to the oaste system that we have in India and instead of ramifying into divisions and subdivisions, it dwindled and disappeared in the course of time. Nounanimity seems possible as to the several causes and ciroum stanoes which led in India alone to the evolution of the stupendous structure of caste. Not only is it impossible to hold that the origin of the modern complexity of the casto system is to be traced back to one single cause, but it is diffioult to accept that even all the origins that have been postulated by the several authors can adoquately and satisfactorily explain the modern caste system.</p>
<p>In most of the works on the castes in India a fow features are pointed out as the characteristics of the caste system and as common to all castes and sub-oestes. They are: (1) heredity i. e. in theory a man is assigned to a particular caste by birth in that oaste ; ( 2 ) endogamy and exogamy i. e. restriction as to marrying in the same caste and not marrying cortain rela. tives or other persons, though of the same caste ; (3) restrio tions as to food ( i. e. what food and water may be taken or not taken and from whom ); (4) occupation ( 1. e. members of most castes follow certain occupations and no others ); (5) grade tion of castes, some being at the top in the social scale and others being deemed to be so low that they are untouchable. Some authors58 like Senart add another characteristic, viz the oaste council with its ohiof having in meeting assembled among other matters the power to regulate the conduct of its members, to impose the penalties of fine or excommunioation for lapses. It may be said at once that this last is a feature</p>

<p>that is not found among most of the brāhmana and kṣatriya castes even in modern times and is not dealt with by dharma sāstra works. Endogamy is now the most prominent characte ristio of caste and so is the theory that it is by birth. The other three are more or less fluctuating from province to prom vince and age to age. In this work the first five characteristics of the oaste system set out above will be subjected to a close critical examination on the basis of the Vedio and dharma sāstra material. We must also remember that the attributes of caste have not been the same throughout the ages. There is great difference between the popular conceptions of modern caste and the conceptions about it embodied in the ancient and medieval dharmaśāstra works. In the twentieth century caste in India is a matter of marriage and to a much lesser extent of food and drink. As to avoca tions any one can at present follow any profession without fear of loss of caste excepting a few believed to be very impure and very degrading ones (like those of sweepers, butchers, tanners &amp;c.). It is also not possible even now for any one to be generally accepted as a priest, unless he is or claims to be a brāhmaṇa. The old barriers that separated one caste or subcaste from another have been greatly shaken by the influx of modern ideas and the exigencies of the times and one may bope that in a few decades more caste will remain as a purely social institution regulating marriages and to a lesser extent oommen. sality (and not a religious one). Western scholars, in spite of their most commendable patience and industry, often present, through ignorance or lack of first-hand knowledge, the number of castes as larger than what it actually is. For example, Sherring (vol. II. Introduction pp. XXII-XLVI) gives an alpbabetical list of brahmanical tribes and remarks ( XLVII) * Hundreds of these tribes, if not at enmity with one another, cherish mutual distrust and antipathy to such a degree that they are socially separated from one another as far as it is possible for them to be-as much as brahmaṇas are from the lowest outoastes-neither eating nor drinking together nor intermarrying'. The list he gives is most misleading. To take only a few examples, he enumerates Athavle, Achwal, Abhyan kara, Apte, Agashe, Bhanu, Bivalkar, Badye, Bhide, Bhagvat, Bhuskute, Bhat, Bodas as separate tribes; but it is well-known to people in Western India that these are the surnames ( not subcastes ) of the Konkanastha or Citpavana brabmaṇas, who not only interdine, but also inter-marry among themselves,</p>

<p>The word varna means &lsquo;colour&rsquo; or &lsquo;light&rsquo; in most passages of the Roveda (e. g. l. 73.7, II. 3.5, IX. 97.15, IX. 104.4, IX. 105.4, X. 124.7 ). But in some verses of the Rgvedas? the word varna is associated with groups of people having a skin of a dark or fair colour. For example, we read in Rg. II. 12.4 (Indra) who placed low the dāsa colour in &amp; cave (or darkness )'; in Rg. I. 179,6 &lsquo;the fierce sage (Agastya) cherished both varñas &lsquo;; in Rg. IX. 71.2 &lsquo;like one (a fighter) who strikes the people he (Soma ) who is powerful goes giving out frequent roars; he exposes the Asura colour&rsquo;; in Rg. I. 130.8 &lsquo;Indra helped in battles the Ārya sacrificer&hellip;&hellip; Indra punished for the sake of Manu ( the dāsas ) who do not observe the ordinances and subdued (or killed ) the dark skin&rsquo;; * Indra having killed the dasyus protected the ārya varṇa (Rg. III. 34.9); &ldquo;You ( Indra ) subdued for Rjiśvan, the son of Vidathin, Pipru and powerful Mṣgaya; you mowed down fifty thousand dark (men), you sbattered cities as old age does shatter good looks&rsquo; Rg. IV. 16.13; &lsquo;Somas, which strike away the dark skin&rsquo; Rg. IX. 41.1. In Rg. I. 158.5 a certain dāsa is called Traitana wbich name has &amp; Persian ring about it; In Rg. I. 104.% varna seems to be placed in opposition to dāse. These passages make it clear that the Aryas and dāsas were two opposing camps and both were designated varnas on account of the colour of their skins. The Tai. Br. I. 2. 6 (with reference to the Mahāvrata in which there was a mook fight between a brābmaṇa and a sūdra ) says &lsquo;that the brāhmaṇa is the divine varṅa, and sūdra is the asurya varna&rsquo; 54 If we can interpret the Rgveda verse by the help of the Tai, Br, then in Rg. 1X, 71.2, the words &lsquo;asuryam varnam&rsquo; mean</p>

<p>between the aryas and dāsas or dasyus is emphasized and prayers are offered to Indra and other gode for having subdued or for subduing the dāsa in favour of the Arya. Rg. I. 51.8; I. 103.3; 1. 117.21; II. 11.2, 4, 18, 19; III. 29.9 ; V. 70.3 ; VII. 5.6; IX. 88.4 ; VI. 18.3 ; VI. 25.2. In Rg. 1. 51.8 Indra is requested to mark who are āryas and who are dasyus. This does not mean that there was difference between the two in bodily appearance only; on the contrary the antithesis between the arya who is referred to as &lsquo;barhismat&rsquo; and the dasyu who is styled &lsquo;avrata&rsquo; clearly shows that the emphasis was rather on the difference of their cults. That dasyu and dāsa are identical in meaning follows from the same epithets being applied to both and from the fact that dasyu and dāsa ooour in the same verses as applying to the same enemy.ss In Rg. X. 22.8 dasyu and dāsa are used in the same verse as applicable to the same enemy. In Rg. X. 99.6 and 8 Indra is represented as killing both daba and dasyu respectively. The dasyus are described as &lsquo;avrata&rsquo; (not obeying the ordinances of the gods ) in Rg. I. 51.8, I. 175.3, VI. 14.3, &lsquo;akratu&rsquo; (who perform no sacrifice) in VII. 6.3,58 mṭdhravacaḥ' ( whose speech is in distinct or soft) in VII. 6.3 and V. 29.10,' anāsaḥ &lsquo;( snub.nosed or dumb) in Rg. V. 29.10. It appears that dāsa and dasyu are synonyms and were sometimes styled asuras. For example, Sambara is called dasyu and dāsa in Rgveda VI. 31.4 and dāsa in Rg. VI. 26.5 and is also associated with asuras like Pipru in VI. 18,8; Pipru is spoken of as a dāsa in Rg. VIIT. 32.2 and as an asura in X. 138.3. Varcin is styled dāsa in Rg. IV, 30.15 and VI. 47.21 and asura in VII. 99,5. In Tai. S. 57 (IV, 3.11.3 ) also it seems that they are held to be identical. The enmity between dāsa and ārya is breathed in such verses as the following: Rg. II. 11.4 &lsquo;vanquish the tribe of dāsas by the sun (i. e. by the help of a brilliant weapon ); Rg. I. 174.7You made the earth a pillow for the dāsa ( i. e. you laid him low on the ground); Rg. III. 12.6 *OhIndra and Agni, by one effort together you shook ninety</p>

<p>cities that had dāgas as overlords&rsquo;. It is not possible to say that dasss or dasyus were some Aryan tribes that had fallen from the worship or culture of the Aryan singers of Vedic hyians. In many places the sage refers to the conquest for him by Indra and other gods of dāsas as well as Aryan foes. For example,</p>
<p>• Protectors of the good! you ( two) killed Aryan foes and dāsa foes&rsquo; Rg. VI. 60.6; &lsquo;Oh Indra and Varuṇal you killed dāsa foes and also Arya foas and helped Sudās with your protection&rsquo; Rg. VII.83.1. Vide also Rg. VI. 22.10, X. 69.6, X, 33.1, X, 102.3. This shows that though the āryans had become divided and fought among themselves, they kept āryas and dāsas quite distinct. The foregoing shows that in the times of the Rgveda there were two antagonistio camps, of the dryas and dāsas or dasyus, tbey differred in the colour of their skins and also in worship, speech and bodily appearance. Therefore, in the earliest period we find the word varna associated only with dāsa and with drya. Though the words brāhmaṇa and kṣatriya occur frequently in the Rgveda, the word varna is not used in connection with them. Even in the Puruṣasākta (Rgveda X. 90 ) where the words brāhmaṇa, rājanya, vaisya and sūdra occur the word varna is not used. Hence, one may reasonably say that the only water tight groups that are positively or expressly vouchsafed by the Rgveda are ārya and dāsa or dasyu. It is often argued that as the word brāhmana denotes a caste in later literature, in the Rgveda also it must be presumed to have the same meaning. But this begs the whole question. No one denies that brāhmana denotes a caste in later literature. But whether it has the same sense in the Rgveda must be determined on the materials furnished by the Rgveda itself. Some rely on the word &lsquo;bra hmaputra&rsquo; in Rg. II. 43,2 as showing that a brāhmaṇa became so only by birth in the Rgveda. But the verse begins by saying that' you sing &amp; Sāma like the Udgātṛ priest and go &lsquo;brahma putra&rsquo;must mean a ftvij whose duty it was to recite śastras (the Brahmapāochamsin ag Sāyana explains). It is generally conceded that the Puruṣagūkta is a muoh later hymn than most of the hymns of the Rgveda. In the whole of the Rgveda the words vaisya and sūdra do not ooour except in the Puruṣa sūkta, though both of them occur in the Atharyaveda (V. 17.9 for vaisya and IV, 20. 4 and 8 for sūdra and ārya) and very frequently in the Tai. . Besides we cannot forget that the final redaction of the Rgveda must be held to have been separated from the composition of the individual hymns by several hundred years ( if not more) and that even if it be oonooded</p>

<p>that at the time when the Puruṣ&amp;sūkta was composed, the four varnas had been constituted and had become castes, yet the same cannot be affirmed for the time of the original composition of the other bymns. The word brāhmana occurs several times in the Rgveda: 58 &lsquo;Oh brāhmaṇas, Oh pitṛs fond of soma! May the sinless Dyāvāprthivi ( Heaven and Earth ) tend to our welfare&rsquo;; &lsquo;Like brāhmaṇas in the Atirātra where soma is to be drunk, utterring ( words ) round a lake full of water you havo, Ob frogs, gathered together on that day of the year on which the rains begin&rsquo; (Rg. VII. 103.7 ); $&ldquo;The brāhmanan, who drink soma, reciting prayers of the yearly sacrifice, have sent forth their speech ( R&amp;. VII. 103. 8). In this verse brāhmaṇas are expressly said to be getting &lsquo;brahma&rsquo; ready. &lsquo;May Agoi who devours every thing make that (dead body ) free from disease and ( may ) soms also ( do the same ) who entered into the brāhmanas&rsquo; ( Rg. X. 16. 6). &ldquo;When the brābmapas worship together as friends in hymns (lit. speed of the mind) that are fabricated from their hearts&rsquo; (Rg. X. 71. 8). In Rø. VI. 75. 10 brāhmaṇas are invoked for welfare along with pitṛs. This shows that the brāhmaṇas were highly venerated. The other verses establish that they were the reciters of hymns (brahma) and drank soma. In Rg. VIII. 35. 16-18 we read &lsquo;You (As vins ) urge on (or inspire ) brabma, you urge on our thoughts (or actions ), you kill the evil spirits and subdue diseases; ( 17 ) you urge ksatra ( valour) and also men, you kill evil spirits ( same as 16 ); (18) you urge on the cows and also the Vis (the rest is same as 16 ),&rsquo; Here it seems that the groups of people (viz. those who think and make songs, those who show valour and lead men, and those common people who tend cattle) are clearly meant. These verses may be conceded as pointing to the exis tence of three groups (brāhmaṇas, kṣatriyas and vitaḥ ) but there is nothing in them to show that these three had crystal. lised into somewhat like the castes of later times. In Rg. VIJ. 33. 11 Vasiṣtha is addressed as brahman, but that does not mean that he was a brābmaṇa (by birth), as he is said to have been born of Urvaśi from Mitra and Varuna. Similarly, in</p>

<p>Rg. IX. 96. 6 (Brahmā devānām ) the word brahma to does not certainly mean &lsquo;brāhmaṇs by birth&rsquo;, nor does &lsquo;viprāṇām&rsquo; mean &ldquo;brāhmanas by birth'. In that verse one who is super eminent among a group is specified, just as the buffalo among animals, the hawk among carnivorous birds &amp;c. Io Rg. VIII. 33. 19 &lsquo;look down and not up: bring your feet close together; may thy kaśaplakas ( legs?) be not seen, for though a brahmā, thou wert born &amp; woman,&rsquo; it is impossible to hold that the last words mean &lsquo;thou wert a brāhmaṇa woman&rsquo;. If it is only intended to refer to the fact that she is a brāhmaṇa woman, there is no reason why the Perfect tense ( babhūvitha ) is used and not the present. Here &lsquo;brahmā&rsquo; most probably means ' a priest of that name', as that is the meaning in Rg. II. I. 2 ( brahma casi grbapatis-ca no dame). The word &lsquo;brabmajāyā&rsquo; in Rg. X. 109.%, 3, 6 and 7 does not mean the wife of a brāhmaṇa by birth but rather &lsquo;wife of Bphaspati&rsquo;. The whole hymn is obscure and more or less enigmatic or allegorical. In the Aitareya-brāhmaṇa 6' 35. 2-4 it is said that soma is the food of brāhmaṇas and that a kṣatriya was to press the tendrils of the Nyagrodha tree and the fruits of Udumbara, Asvattha and Plakga and drink the juice 80 pressed instead of soma. It appears, therefore, that the brāhmaṇas were a distinot group even in the earliest period of the Rgveda, Whether they were hereditary is certainly not olear; nor is there anything to show that there were restrictions as regards partaking of food from persons other than brahmanas or as to marriage. That brāhmaṇas in the Rgveda were &amp; class by themselves may be conceded, but whether they had become a caste by birth is a matter of opinion dependent on the connotation given to the word oaste. Dr. Ghurye (Caste and race in India' p. 42 ) thinks, probably following the Vedic Index (vol. I on Ksatriya ), that the reference in Rg. X. 71. 9 to a false claim for being regarded as a brāhmaṇa points to the nonolusion that brāhmapas had become a caste. The verge literally translated means &lsquo;these ( persons) who do not move below nor beyond, who are neither brāhmaṇas, nor engaged in pressing some &ndash; they</p>

<p>being ignorant and having reported to speech in sinful (or coarse ) language take to ploughshares and engage in (agri. oultural) operations&rsquo;. It is difficult to see how there is here any false claim to be regarded us a brāhmaṇa. This verse means apparently that those who are not composers of prayers or drinkers of soma ( because they are ignorant) are men of low speech and have to turn to agriculture. Even in the days of the dharma-sūtras restrictions as to food and marriage for brāhmaṇas were not at all as rigid as they became in medieval and modern times; but even when these restrictions were not rigid it was clearly laid down that a brābmana is so by birth alone. The word &lsquo;brahma&rsquo; generally means in the Rgveda prayer' or hymn'. Vide 62 Ry IV. 6.11, VI. 52.2, X. 105.8, X. 141.5 ( &lsquo;Oh Agni, make our prayer and sacrifice prosper by your flaines&rsquo;). Rg. III. 53.12 is this brahma (prayer or spiritual power) of Viśvāmitra protects the Bharata people'. In the Atharvaveda II. 15.4 (as brahma and kṣatra entertain no fear, nor are they harmed) brahma seems to mean the class of brāhmaṇas'. The transition of ineaning from &lsquo;brahma&rsquo; (prayer) to &lsquo;brahma&rsquo; meaning the class of those who composed or recited prayers is natural and easy. In the Rgveda I. 157.2 both brahina and kpatra occure3 in the same verse where they probably mean &lsquo;prayer&rsquo; and &lsquo;valour&rsquo; respectively. In the Atharvaveda III. 19.1 both words ocour and probably mean the same thing as in Rg. I. 157,2. In some Vedio works brahma and kṣatra stand collectively for brāhmaṇas 4 and ksatriyas ( e. g. Tai. Br. II. 7.18, Bṛ. Up. I. 4.11, Kathopaniṣad I. 2. 24). The word kṣatriya is very frequently applied as an epithet to several gods; e. 8. Rg. VII. 64. 2 and VIII. 25. 8 (in both to Mitra and Varuna ), Rg. VIII. 67. 1 (to Adity as ), Rg. X. 66.8 (to gods in general). In some verges kṣatriya means&rsquo;a king or a nobleman'; o. g. Rg. IV, 42.1 &lsquo;the kingdom on both sides (heaven and earth) belongs to me, who am &amp; kṣatriya and who holds sway over all living persons, so that all the immortals (gods) are ours (on my side)'; &amp;Rg.

<p>( = Atharva V. 17.3 ) the domain of the ksatriya has been protected (from the sight of enemies )&rsquo;. The word &lsquo;rājanya occurs in the Rgveda only in the Purusasūkta. It ocours in the sense of kṣatriya in the Atharvaveda V. 17.9. The same remark applies to the word kṣatriya as to brāhmang. It is difficult to say whether kṣatriyas were so by birth in the times of the hymns of the Rg. or were only a class more or less fluid. We find that the Rg. speaks of Devāpi as the purohita of Santanu who became a king. The story is tbat both were sons of Rṣtiṣena and that Santanu, though a younger brother, became king as Devāpi was not willing to be a king. The result was a famine due to Santanu&rsquo;s transgression and 80 Devāpi performed &amp; sacrifice to induce rainfall. This shows that out of two brothers one became a king and the other &amp; purohita. So kings and purohitas did not depend on birth. In Rg. IX. 112, 3 a poet exolaims ' I am a reciter of hymns my father is &amp; physician and my mother grinds ( corn ) with stones. We desire to obtain wealth in various actions. 67 In Rg. III. 44.5 the poet wistfully asks Indra &lsquo;O, Indra, fond of soma, would you make me the protector of people, or would you make me &amp; king, would you make me &amp; sage, that has drunk of soma, would you impart to me endless wealth ?&rsquo; This shows that the same man could be a ṛṣi or &amp; noble or a king. Dr. Ghurye (in &lsquo;Caste and race in India&rsquo; p. 44) thinks that the kṣatriyas had become a compact body and he particularly relies on Rg. VII. 104. 13 ( = Atharvaveda VIII, 4. 13 ) which is cited in the Vedio Index (vol. 1, p. 207 ) for the same purpose. That verse literally means ' Soma does not urge on the crooked one, nor the kṣatriya who bears false. He strikes the rakṣas, and strikes him who speaks falsely; both lie in the bonds of Indra&rsquo;. The words * kṣatriyam mithuya dharayantam' are explained by Sayaṇa as * Ksatriya who bears false words'. The 2nd half is only an expansion of the first half and so &lsquo;vṛjina&rsquo; corresponds to *rakṣas' and &lsquo;asad vadantan&rsquo; is only a paraphrase of &lsquo;mithuyā dbārayantam&rsquo;. They may mean this that one who is a kṣatriya, but has no strength as a kṣatriya abould have, is at</p>

<p>the ineroy of Indra. Unless we project our notions of the later state of society and the caste system when considering this verse, it is hardly possible to hold that this verse indicates that it refers to persons making a false claim for entrance into &amp; com pact body of ksatriyas by birth. Dr. Ghurye also says (p. 44 ) *The 2nd order in society, the kṣatriya, is known in the earlier portions of the Rgveda as rājanya.' I have not been able to find the word rājanya in the Rgveda any where except in the Puruṣa - sākta. In the Aitareya brahmans (chap. 34. 2) the word &lsquo;rājanya&rsquo; stands for a member of the 2nd class in society, while ksatriya means a king of whom land ( for sacrifice to gods ) is asked for by brāhmaṇa, rājanya or vaisya.</p>
<p>Though the word vaisya ooours in the Rgveda only in the Purugasūkta, the word &lsquo;vis&rsquo; is very frequently employed in it. It generally means people or group of people'. In a large number of cases we have the words mānuṣīr-visaḥ or mānuṣiṇu vikṣu or mānuṣiṇām vigām, 0.g. Rg. III.5.3, III.6.3, III. 11.5 (invincible Agni goes in front of human groups ), IV. 6. 7 and 8, IV.9.2, V. 1. 9, V. 8,3, VI. 48. 8, VI. 47. 16 ( viso mānuṣyān ), X. I. 4, X. 69. 9. In some places we have dāsir visah' (the dāsa hordes ) e. g. IV. 28-4, VL. 25.2. In 68 Rg. III. 34.2 we have &lsquo;Ob Indra, you are the leader of human hordes as well as of divine hordes&rsquo; (where we have daivinām visām). Rg. 69 VIII. 63.7 ( when loud invocations were sent towards Indra by the people consisting of five groups ) shows that&rsquo;vis' means all the Aryan people. In Rg. V. 32. 11 Indra is styled &lsquo;pāñcajanya&rsquo;(favourable to the five people ) and in IX. 66. 20 Agni has the appellation pañcajanyaḥ purohitab (the purohita of the five peoples). Sometimes jana and viś seem to be contradistinguished as in Rg. II. 26. 3 ( sa ij-janena sa visā ga janmanā 88 putrair-vājam bharate dhana npbhib ). But the very fact that vis is qualified also as pāñoajanya shows that</p>

<p>there was hardly any distinction between jana and vis, In the Rg veda frequent reference is made to five people (pañoa janaḥ ); vide Rg. III. 37. 9, III. 59.7, VI. 11. 4, VIII. 32. 22, X. 65.23, X. 45,6. In the same way the words krsti (II. 2. 10, IV.38.10), kṣiti (V. 35. 2, VI. 48. 7, VII. 75, 4 ), oarsani( V.86.2, VII, 15.2 ) are employed along with pañca. We have also pāñcajanyasu krsṭiṣu' in Rg. III. 53.16. So it is clear that vis cannot in almost all hymns of the Rg, mean' vaiśya ' but means the people' or</p>
<p>ārgan people' when no epithet like &lsquo;dāsih&rsquo; or daivih is prefixed. The Ait. Br. (1. 26 ) says that visaḥ' means</p>
<p>rāstrāṇi' (countries) when explaining Rg. IV. 50.8 ( tasmai viśaḥ svayam-avānamante ).</p>
<p>The word &lsquo;dāsa&rsquo; in later literature means &lsquo;&amp; serf or a slave.&rsquo; It follows that the dāsa tribes that we see opposed to the Aryas in the Rgvoda were gradually vonquished and were then made to serve the Aryas. In the Manusmști (VIII. 413 ) the sūdra is said to have been created by God for service (dāsya ) of the brāhmapa.71 We find in the Tai. S., the Tai. Br. and other Brāhmaṇa works that the sūdra oooupies the same position that he does in the smśtis. Therefore it is reasonable to infer that the dāss or dasyus conquered by the Aryas were gradually transformed into the sūdras, From being enemies they were brought into friendly relations and given &amp; very subordinate position. Traces are visible even in the Rgveda that friendly relations had begun to be established between certain dāsas and the priests. For example in Rg. VIII. 46. 32 we read * the singer took a hundred (cows or other gifts) from the dāsa Balbūtha and froin Tarukṣa.' In the Puruṣasūkta (X. 90.12 ) the brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaisya and sūdra are said to have sprung from the mouth, arms, thighs and feet of the supreme Puruṣa. In the very next verse the sun and the moon are said to have been born from the eye and mind of the Purusa. This shows that the composer of the hymn regarded the division of society into four classes to be very ancient and to be as natural and God-ordained as the sun and the moon.</p>
<p>We shall now see what position was assigned to the sūdra in the Vedio Samhitās and Brābmapas. In the Rgveda the Ārya is contradistinguished from the men of dark skin. In the dharmasūtras we find the Sūdras spoken of as &lsquo;dark varna.&rsquo;</p>

Therefore those two, the horse and the sūdra, are the convey. ances of beings; therefore the sūdrs is not fit (or ordained ) for sacrifice&rsquo; (Tai. S. VII. 1. 1. 6).73 This shows that the sūdrs could not perform the Vedic sacrifices and that he was employed for carrying persons in &amp; palanquin or otherwise. In Tai. S. V. 7. 6. 3-4 we have put light (glory) in our brahmaṇas, put it in our chiefs (or kings ), (put) light in vaisyas and sūdras, put light in me by your light.&lsquo;74 This is a sure indication that the sūdra who took the place of the dāsa is here placed on the same level with the other three classes in the matter of the receipt of light from God and that far from being looked upon as an enemy, he had come to be looked upon as a member of the society (though the lowest in the scale). &lsquo;The sūdra is a moving burial ground; therefore one should not study the Veda in the vicinity of a sūdra.&rsquo; 7 &lsquo;He created the brāh inana with Gayatri, the rājanya with Triṣtubh and the vaisya with Jagati; but he did not create the sūdra with any metre. 76 The Tandyamahābrāhmaṇa saya &quot; &lsquo;Therefore a sūdra, though he may have many beasts, is not entitled to perform sacrifice, he is godless as no deity was created after bim (as in the case of the other varnas ); therefore he does not go beyond washing the feet (of the three other varnas ), since he was created from the foet&rsquo; (this last being an allusion to the Puruṣasūkta X, 90, 12 pudbhyām śūdro ajāyata ). This sbows that the sūdra, however rich in cattle he might be, had to perform the menial duty of washing the feet of dvijus. The</p>

<p>Satapatha Br, says that the sūdrn is untruth&rsquo; (8. B. E. vol. 44. p. 446 ), that the sūdra is toil&rsquo; (S. B. E. vol. 44 p. 410), and that a dikṣita ( one who was initiated for a Vedio sacrifice ) was not to speak with a gūdra (S. B. E. vol. 26 p. 4). The Aitareya Brāhmaṇa remarks that &lsquo;the sūdra78 is at the beck and call of others ( the three varnas), ho can be made to rise at will, he can be beaten at will.&rsquo; When the father of Sunaḥsepa?&rsquo; ( who had sold Sunshseps for 100 coins and had shown himself ready to kill him as a paśu for another hundred coins ) urged his son to come back to him after the boy had been taken into favour by Varuna and Visvamitra, he contemptu. ously discards his father&rsquo;s proposal with the words ' one who commits an evil deed once may commit another sinful deed thereafter; you did not leave aside the sūdra&rsquo;s line of conduct; you did what leaves no door for reconoiliation.' These passages show that the sūdra, though he had ceased to be an enemy of the arya and had been allowed to be within the pale of society, was looked down upon, was assigned a very low position, had to perform work of toil as a menial and was not allowed to perform Vedio sacrifices. A clear line of demarca tion was kept between the Arya and the Sūdra in the times of the Brāhmaṇa works and even in the dharmasūtras. The Tandya Brabmaṇaso speaks of a mook fight &lsquo;the sūdra and ārya fight on a hide, out of the two they 80 arrange that the arya colour becomes the victor&rsquo;. The Ap. Dh. 8. (1. 1.3.40-41 Bayg8l that a brāhmaoārin, if he cannot himself eat all the food he has brought by begging, may keep it near an ārya (for bis use ) or he may give it to a sūdra who is a dāsa ( of his teacher). The same Dharmasūtra8% (II. 2.3. I and 4 ) Says &lsquo;Aryas who are pure (by bath) should prepare the food for Vaiśvadeva ;&hellip;&hellip;or sūdras supervised by Aryas should prepare it&rsquo;.

<p>gūdra having sexual intercourse with an ārya woman. Jaimini in his Pūrvamimāðsā sūtra (VI. 1.25-38 ) establishes after elaborate discussion that the sūdra has no adhikāra for the performance of Agnihotra and Vedic sacrifices. It is, however, somewhat gratifying to find that at least one ācārya, Bādari, espoused the cause of the sūdra and propounded the view that all ( including sūdras ) were entitled to perform Vedic sacrifices (VI. 1.27). In the Vedānta-sūtras also (I. 3.34-38 ) it is established that the sūdra has no adhikūra for brahmavidyā based on Veda study, though some sūdras like Vidura might have been endowed with the knowledge of brahma owing to samskāras of former births. In the smrti literature, however, a few passages are found allowing marriages of aryas with sūdra women (which will be discussed later on). Similarly sexual relations ( illicit) between &amp; sūdra woman and &amp; man of higher varna are alluded to even in the Samhitās e. g. Tai. 8.88 VII. 4.19.3 ' when &amp; sūdra woman has an ārya as her paramour she does not seek wealth for the prosperity ( of her relations )&rsquo;. In Ait. Br. (8. 1) there is the story of Kavaṣa Ailūṣa, who was driven out from the sacrifice on the Sarasvati with the words &lsquo;Oh, son of a female slave, you are a rogue and not a brahmana ; how did you take the dikṣs (initiation) as one of us&rsquo; and they carried hiin off to &amp; sandy desert with the idea that he might die of thirst there. He when tormented by thirst' saw' the hymn Rg. X. 30 and Sarasvati came rushing to him.4 Further discussion about the sūdra and his dis abilities will follow in another section later,</p>
<p>The position of the three varnas inter se ( called collectively arya ) now requires consideration. It is clear that the Samhitas other than the Rgveda and Brāhmaṇa works show that the three classes of brāhmaṇas, ksatriyas and vaisyas had bocome differ entiated and their privileges, duties and liabilities had become more or less fixed in those times.</p>

<p>In Rg. IV. 50.8 we read that king alone who places brabma first (i. e. honours him ) dwells happy in his house, for him the earth always remains prosperous and to him all the people (or kingdoms ) bow down of their own accord'. &lsquo;Brāhmaṇas 85 are gods that are directly seen&rsquo; (Tai. S. I. 7.3.1); &lsquo;there are two kinds of gods; for indeed the gods are gods and the brāhmaṇas who have studied and teach the sacred lore are the human gods&rsquo; Śat. Br. (S. B, E. vol. 12 p. 309, vol. 26 p. 341 ). In the Atharvaveda V. 17. 19 there is an assertion of the pre-eminence of brāhmaṇas and the consequences of harming them or their cows. Therefore the brāhmaṇa is the foremost &lsquo;(Tai. 8. II. 6.2.5, V.2.7.1). Therefore the brāhmaṇa shows his might by his mouth, since he was created from the mouth&rsquo; ( Tāndya Br. XI. 1. 2 ).88 In the Ait. Br. ( 33. 4) Varuṇa, when he was told that a brāhmaṇa boy would be offered in place of the son of the king Hariscandra, is made to say &lsquo;a brāhmaṇa is indeed pre ferable to a ksatriya&rsquo;. The mere fact of birth as brahmana&rsquo;s son is represented here as giving to the boy pre-eminence over a king&rsquo;s son. On the other hand the Sat. Br. says (V. 1. 1. 12) &lsquo;a brāhmaṇa 87 is not adequate to ( competent to manage ) a kingdom&rsquo;. In the Tai. Br. it is said that playing on the viṇā ( in the Aévamedha ) is to be done by a brāhmaṇa and a rājanya (and not by two brāhmaṇas ), since wealth does not find delight in the brāhmaṇa. The Satapatha Brāhmaṇa 88 ( XI. 5. 7,1 )lays emphasis on the four peculiar attributes of brābmaṇas viz. brāhmanya ( purity of parentage as a brāhmaṇa ), pratirūpacaryā ( befitting deportment or conduct ), yasas ( glory ) and lokapakti ( the teaching or perfecting of people ). &ldquo;When the people are being perfected or taught by him, people endow him with four privileges viz. arcā ( honour), dāna (gifts ), ajyeyatā (freedom</p>

Teaching had become so much associated with the brāhmaṇas that when the brahmana Gārgya approached king Ajātasatru for the knowledge of brahma, the latter replied “this is oontrary to the natural order that a brāhmaṇa should approach a ksatriya with the idea&rdquo; he ( ksatriya) will propound to me brahma..&rdquo; In a separate section below all the privileges enjoyed by the brahmanas will be set out at one place.88</p>

<p>The position of ksatriyas and their relation to the brah maṇas falls to be considered now. First of all with reference to the king several important passages may be cited. In some Cases rājan' means only a noble' or &lsquo;chief&rsquo;, as in Rs. X. 42. 10, X. 97. 6. In many passages rājan' means &lsquo;king&rsquo;. The government often seems to have been tribal, such tribes as Yadus, Turvabas, Druhyus, Anus and Pūrus (Rg. I. 108. 8) being frequently mentioned ( vide Rg. VII. 18. 6 for Bhrgus and Druhyus and VII. 18. 7 for Tștsus, VIII. 6. 46 for Yadvas ). Whether kingship was by election it is not necessary here to discuss. The king was regarded as keeping the people within bounds. When a king was crowned, it was thought that &lsquo;a ksatriya was produced, a lord of all beings, the defender of brāhmaṇas (or of holy texts ) and of dharma.'&rsquo;! The Sat. Br. says &lsquo;for these two ( śrotriya and king ) are the upholders of the sacred law among men (8. B. E. vol. 41 p. 106 ).&rdquo; That the co-operation between brāhmaṇa and kṣatriya results in glory and success is frequently emphasized e. g. *therefore a brāhmaṇa must certainly be approached by a ksatriya who is about to perform some act, for indeed that act of &amp; kṣatriya which is sped on by brāhmaṇa succeeds (Satapatha, S. B. E. vol. 26 pp. 270-271). The purohita of &amp;</p>

<p>kṣatriya came to occupy a very high position. The Satapatha (8. B. E. vol. 26 p. 270) lays emphasis on the importance of the purohita and cautions a brāhmaṇa against being the purohita of any king he meets with and adds that a brahmana may remain without a king, but a king should not be without a brahmana. Even the gods required &amp; purohita, as the Tai. S. II. 5. 1. 1. says' Viśvarūpe son of Traṣtr was the purobita of gods. 44 Sanda and Aiarka were the purohitas of the Asuras ( Kathaka S. IV. 4). Agni is often called purohita (Rg. I. 1. 1., I. 44. 10, III. 2. 8). &ldquo;May we, purohitas, be awake in the kingdom (for its welfare )' says the Tai. 8. (I. 7. 10.1). The Ait. Br. ( chap. 34.8) say895 * the purohita is half the soul of the ksatriya' and contains an eulogy of purohita in the following words ( 40.1 ) &quot; for indeed the gods do not eat the food of a king who has no purohita ; therefore a king when about to offer a sacrifice should have a brāhmaṇa as his purohita with the idea &lsquo;may the gods eat my food.&rdquo;&rdquo; The combination of the brāhmaṇa and the rājanya is said to be most desirable and that it is conducive to the eminence of both is declared in the Tai. S. (V. 1. 10. 3 )86 . Therefore a brāhmaṇa who is supported by a rājanya is superior to another brālmana (not so supported ), hende a rājanya who has a brāhmana ( to help him ) is superior to another rājanya&rsquo;. The Satapatha ( V. 4. 4. 15 ) deolares that king indeed who is not powerful to the brāhmaṇas ( i. e. who is humble before the brāhmaṇas ) becomes more powerful than his foes.&lsquo;97 It is not to be supposed that this attainment of the supreme position by brāhmapas was an affair of plain sailing. Sometimes kṣatriyas claimed higher position and also paid scant respect to brahmaṇas. In the Satapatha we read &lsquo;whence the brahmana is an object of respect after the king&rsquo;( S. B. E. vol. 41, p. 96 ); hence the people here serve, from a lower po ition, the kṣatriya seated above them&rsquo; Satapatha (S. B. E. vol. 12 p. 94 ); &lsquo;hence when a nobleman approaches, all these people, the subjects crouch down hy him on the ground &lsquo;Satapatha ( S. B. E. vol. 26 p. 228 ); therefore there is nothing higher than the kṣatra;</p>

<p>therefore the brāhmana sits down below the ksatriya in the Rajasuya&rsquo;( Satapatha 14. 4. 1. 23 =Bṛ. Up. I. 4. 11). In the Atharvaveda several verges occur which declare the harm that results from disrespecting or injuring a brābmana or from rob. bing him of his cow. &ldquo;He who regards brahmana as food drinks of the poison of Taimāta; he who injures &amp; brāhmana, the rela. tive of the gods, does not attain to the world of pitss ( Atharvs veda V. 18. 4 and 13). Those who spat on a brāhmaṇa or those who sent to him muous remain biting the hair in the midst of a stream by their mouth; that kingdom sinks as water sinks a shattered vessel, where they injure &amp; brāhmana; that wicked aot strikes that kingdom * ( Atharvaveda V. 19. 3 and 8).</p>
<p>The stories of king Kārtavirya and Visvā mitra who respec tively carried off the cows of Jamadagni and Vasistha narrated in the Mahabhārata (Santi 49 for Kartavirga; Ādi. 175 for Viūvamitra ) and the Purāṇas show how several kings were high-handed and treated brāhmaṇas with no respect whatever. It appears that even the wives of brāhmaṇas were not quite safe at the hands of kings. The chamberlain ( kṣat) of that king in whose kingdom the wife of a brāhmana is thoughtlessly put under restraint does not march in front of cooking vessels with a golden ornament on his neok*99 ( Atharva V. 17. 14). The somewhat mystical hymn (Rg. X. 109 ) where &lsquo;brahmajāyā&rsquo; figures prominently probably hints at the same fact (viz. tbe kidnapping of the wives of brābmanas ).</p>
<p>The Tai. S. says that &lsquo;the vaisya indeed sacrifices, being desirous of cattle&rsquo; and that the gods having been defeated were reduced to the condition of being the vaisyas or &lsquo;vis of asuras&rsquo;; 100 &lsquo;the vaisya among men, cows among beasts, therefore they are to be enjoyed ( to be eaten, to be subsisted upon) by others; they were produced froin the receptacle of food; therefore they exceed others in numbers, 101 The Tai.

<p>said to have been born from pk verses, they declare the Yajur veda as the origin of the ksatriya, the Sāmaveda is indeed the source of brāhmaṇas. 108 The same Brāhmaṇa further says the vis go away from (reside separately from ) the brahmaṇas and ksatriyas&rsquo;. The Tāṇdya Br. says!&rdquo;? &lsquo;Hence the vaisya, though being eaten ( i. e. subsisted upon) by others is not exhausted, since he was created from the prajanana (from the sexual parts of Prajāpati); therefore he has numerous cattle, he bas all the gods (as his patrons ) and was produced with the Jagati metre, his season is the rains, therefore he is to be eaten by the brābmans and the rājanya, since he was created as lower (than those two classes). The Sat. Br. (S. B. E. vol. 26 p. 335 ) 88ys &lsquo;He thus assigns to the Maruts a share tberein after Indra, whereby he makes the people ( vis ) subser vient and obedient to the nobility 5.104 According to the Ait. Br. 35, 3 the vaisya is one who is the food of others, who pays taxes to others. These passages show that vaibyas were entitled to sacrifice, reared cattle, were far more numerous than the other two classes, they had to bear the brunt of taxation, they lived apart from brāhmaṇas and kṣatriyas and were</p>
<p>obedient to them.</p>
<p>The system of the four varṇas had taken such deep roots in the period when the Brāhmaṇa works were composed, that we often meet with Vedic passages saying that it extended even to the gods, Agni and Bșhaspati being the brāhmaṇas among gods; Indra, Varuṇa, Soma, Yama being the kṣatriyas; Vasus, Rudras, the Viśve Devas and Maruts being the vis, and Pūṣan being the sūdra. 105 Similarly it is said the brāhmaṇa is really spring, the kṣatriya summer, and the vis are the rainy season.&rsquo;</p>

<p>That there were other professions and crafts with specific names ( which in later times at least became castes ) even in the times of the Samhitās is quite clear. The Rg. speaks of vaptā ( barber ) in X. 142.4, taṣtā (a carpenter or maker of chariots ) in Rg. I. 61.4, VII. 32.20, IX. 112.1, X119.5; tvaṣta (a carpenter ) in VIII. 102.8; bhisak (medicine man) in IX. 112.1 and 3, karmāra or kārmāra (iron-smith) in X. 72.2 and IX. 112.2, carmanna ( tanner) in Rg. VIII. 5.38.</p>
<p>The Atharvavada mentions rathakāra ( III. 5.6 ), karmara (III. 5.6 ) and sūta (III. 5.7). In the Tai. S. (IV. 5.4.2 )106 mention is made of kṣatr (royal chamberlain or doorkeeper), samgrabitr (treasurer), takṣan ( carpenter ) and rathakāra ( maker of chariots ), kulala (potter), karmāra, puājista (fowler), nisada, iṣukst (maker of arrows), dhanvakrt ( maker of bows ), mrgayu ( hunter) and svani ( those who lead packs of hounds ). These also occur in the Vājasaneya-sambitā 16.26-28 and these and a few more in Vāj. S. 30.5-13 and in Kathaka Samhita 17.13. In the Tai. Br. (III. 4.1 and the following anuvākas that deal with Puruṣanedha) we have dyogū, māgadha (bard), sūla, kailūṣa (actor), rebba, bbsmala, ratbakāra, takṣan, kaulala, karmāra, mapikāra, vapa (sower or barber), iṣukāra, dhanvakāra, jyākāra (maker of bow-string), rajjusarga, mrgayu, svani Burākāra ( vintner), ayastāpa (heater of iron or copper), kitava ( gambler ), bidalakāra ( worker in wicker-work ), kantakakāra. The Satapatha Br. XI, 8.1. speaks of kaulala-oakra (the potter&rsquo;s wheel). The Tai. Br. III. 8.5, mentions also rājaputra ugra. The Satapatha (S. B. E. Vol. 44 p. 397) speaks of Marutta Avikṣita as an ayogava king. This latter is a pratiloma caste according to the dharmasutras (vide below). Whether in the Satapatba that word has the same sense is doubtful. The Tai, 8. I. 8.9.1-2 mentions among the ratnas&rsquo; (the jewels ), the sūta, grāmaṇi, kṣats, samgrabit?, bhāgadugha ( collector of taxes ), akṣāvāpa ( superintendent of gambling). Vide also Tai. Br. I. 7.3. In the Tāṇdya Brāhmaṇa (19.1.4 ) it is said that ' eight brave persons hold up the kingdom viz. the king&rsquo;s brother, the king&rsquo;s son, the purohita, the crowned queen, the sūta, the grāmapi, kṣats and samgrabit?&rsquo;. Therefore it looks likely that kṣat; and samgrabitf were high officers of state and not castes. In the Sat. Br. XIII. 4. 1. 5 among the</p>

<p>guards of the horse let loose in the Agvamedha there were a hundred sons of kṣātr&amp;-samgrabitrs carrying olubs&rsquo;. As the word &lsquo;kṣātra&rsquo; is prefixed to samgrabitr' it follows that &lsquo;samgrabitrs&rsquo; were officers who may have belonged to any varna. In the same passage inention is made of a hundred guardians who were the sons of sūtagrāmanis. In another passage of the same brāhmaṇa ( XIII. 2.2.18) the sūtas and grāmanis are said to be no kings and yet are rājakt (i. e. king-makers ), 107 This means probably that they are the prinoipal persons on wbose support the king depends. The Sat. Br. V. 4. 4.15-19 arranged brāhnapa, king, king&rsquo;s brother, sūta or sthapati, grāmani, sajāta in a descending soale of powerfulness. So the sūta appears to have been originally an important officer. It is hardly possible to say with assurance that all tbese had become petrified into castes in the modern sense, particularly when several persons associated with these in the Vaj, S. and elsewhere were not castes such as the thief ( taskara ), the impotent ( kliba ), humpbacked ( kubja ), dwarf ( vāmana ); but most of the avocations and crafts referred to above have corresponding castes and subcastes for hundreds of years. It is therefore possible to say that in the times of the Samhitas and Brāhmaṇas these were groups founded on oocupations that had become castes or were in process of developing into castes. The Tāṇdya Br. speaks of Kirātas ( who were and are non-Aryan and were abori ginal tribes ). 108 The Vāj. . (30. 17 ) speaks of Paulkasa in connection with bibhatsā ( nauseating filth ) and of cāṇdāls ( in 30.21 ) in connection with yāyu ( wind). The paulkasa and capdāla oocur in Tai. Br.

In later literature ugra is the offspring of a ksatriya from a $ūdra woman (Yāj. I. 91 ). In the Rg. X. 97, 12 the word ugra ocours &ldquo;You destroy disease just as an ugra who is a mediator or arbitrator (removes dispute ).&rdquo; What ugra means here cannot be said with certainty. It may only mean a &lsquo;formi. dable ohief or king.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The rathakāra and niṣāda deserve a passing notice. The Tai. Br. I. 1. 4 after stating that the brahmans should conge orate sacred fires in the spring, the ksatriya in summer, the vaikya in autumn, ordains that the rathakāra should consecrate sacred fires in the rainy season. The question arises whether the rathakāra is a member of the three higher castes who has taken in economio distress to the profession of making chariots or is a person belonging to a caste other than the three higher varpas. Jaimini in bis Purvamimaisi-sutra (VI. 1. 44-50) discusses this question and establishes&rdquo; that the rathakāra is a member of &amp; oaste other than the three higher varṇas, that he has on account of the express words in the śruti the privilege to consecrate sacred fires with vedio mantras, that the mantra for the consecration of rathakāras is &lsquo;;bhūṇāın tvā&rsquo; (Tai Br. 1. 1. 4) and that the rathakāras are the caste called Saudhanvand which is neither sūdra nor one of the three higher ones, but is slightly inferior to the three higher varnas.

<p>With reference to an isti offered to Rudra &amp; Vedic text says &lsquo;one should make a niṣādasthapati perform this iṣti.&rsquo; The Pārvamimañsā sūtra 114 (VI. 1, 51-52) discusses the question whether this authorises a nisāda who is himself a chieftain or a chieftain (who is a member of the three higher varṇas) of niṣadas. The established conclusion is that the iṣti is to be performed by a niṣāda who is &amp; chieftain though he be beyond the pale of the three varmas, as the Karmadbāraya compound is the proper way of dissolving the compound and not the genitive Tatpuruṣa.

(37.7) says 118 &lsquo;just as the niṣadas, or selagas (thieves) or evil-doers seize a wealthy man in a forest and throwing him in &amp; well run away with his wealth.&rsquo; The Sāṅkhāyana Br. ( 25. 15 ) allows one who had performed the Visvajit sacrifice (in whioh everything is given away ) to stay in &amp; settlement of niṣadas whose food is the lowest that he is allowed to take. The Katya yanaśrauta-sūtra (I. 1. 12-14) says 118 that the chieftain who is &amp; niṣada can offer &amp; caru of Gavedbuka corn to Rudra, but this offering is to be made in ordinary firo ( and not in the fires consecrated with Vadio mantras ) i. e. the permission to offer Raudra iṣti does not entitle him to perform Vedio consecration of fire ( &amp;dbāna ). But scoording to Satyāṣādba 117_kalpa III. 1 both the niṣāda and the rathakāra are entitled to perform</p>

<p>The Aitareya Brahmana 118 narrates that Vigvamitra oursed his senior fifty sons, when they did not agree to his pro posal to treat Sunah epa ( Devarāta ) as his son, that they would associate with the lowest castes and that they became the Andhras, Puṇdras, Sabaras, Pulindas and Mūtibas who are among the lowest of society and are mostly composed of dasyus. It is probably owing to this legend that the Manusmrti 11&rsquo; (X. 43-45 ) is prepared to regard the Paupdrakas, the Odras, Dravi. dag, Kambojas, Yavanas, Sakas, Paradas, Pahlavas, Cinas, Kirātas, Daradas and Kbaśas as being originally kṣatriya castes, but later on reduced to the position of sūdras by the non performance of Vedio saskāras (like upanayana) and by the absence of contact with brāhmaṇas. Manu further adds that the various castes that are outside the ( influence of the ) four verṇas are all known &amp;8 dasyus whether they speak the language of Mlecchas or of Aryas.</p>
<p>One very important question is whether the theory of the four varṇas with their peculiar privileges and duties desoribed in the dharmasūtras and other smrtis was merely a theory even in the most ancient times. When the Purusasūkta of the Rg veda speaks of Brāhmaṇa, Rājanya, Vaibya and Sadra or when the Satapatha Brāhmaṇa expressly says that they are four Varnas, it appears to me that they speak of facts existing in their times and not merely of a theory which was to be striven for as an ideal. Smrti writers try to place all their diota in the frame-work of the varnas because the four varnas and their duties and privileges had been more or less clearly defined in the times of the Vedas and Brābmaṇas, which according to the authors of the smṛtis were sruti, eternal and infallible. They tried to approximate the state of society existing in their times to the varnas which they held were of hoery antiquity. But there is nothing to show that the same difficulties were felt by the authors of the Vedic hymns and the Brāhmaṇas. The manner in which they refer to the privileges and disabilities of the several varnas have such a deep ring of actuality that one must concede that the varṇas spoken of in them represented the</p>

<p>The preceding discussion renders the following propositions most probable ;</p>
<p>(1) that in the earliest times about which we have literary records there were only two varnas, the āryas and their opponents the dasyus or dāsas; that the difference between the two was based on difference of colour and oulture and was thus more or less racial and cultural;</p>
<p>(2) that centuries before the samhitā period closed the dasyus had been conquered and were given a position subservi ent to the aryas ;</p>
<p>(3) that the sūdras were the dasyus so subjugated and made subservient ;</p>
<p>(4) that the spirit of exclusiveness and pride of superio rity existing among the Āryas with reference to dasyus soon extended to groups among the āryas themselves;</p>
<p>(5) that by the time of the Brāhmaṇa Literature, brahmanas (men supposed to be devoted to learning and priest hood), kṣatriyas (kings, noblemen and some warriors ) and vaiøyas ( the artisans and common people ) had become sepa rated into groups more or less dependent on birth and that the brahmana 10 had come to be regarded as superior to the kṣatriya by the fact of birth ;</p>
<p>(6) that even such low castes as cāpdāles and paulkasas had been evolved long before the end of the Vedio period ;</p>
<p>(7) that owing to cultural advance, division of labour arose and numerous arts and crafts bad been developed and they were in process of contributing to the complexity of the system by creating numerous sub-castes based upon occu pations ;</p>
<p>(8) that besides the four varnas intermediate castes like the rathakāra had been evolved ;</p>
<p>(9) that there were certain non-Aryan tribes which were supposed to have been originally ksatriyas but fallen later on.</p>

<p>Several centuries before the Christian ere there were Beveral castes. This follows not only from the dharmasūtras but also from the ancient Buddhist works and from the meagre existing fragments of the work of Megasthenes on India. Though Megasthenes was confused in his statements about the caste system as prevalent in his day, some propositions are clearly deducible therefrom. He states (pp. 40 ff) that the whole population of India was divided into seven castes, (1) philosophers, (2) husbandmen, (3) neatherds and shepherds, (4) artisans, (5) military, (6) overseers, (7) councillors and assessors. Out of these 1 and 5 correspond to brāhmaṇas and kṣatriyas, 2-3 to vaisyas, 4 to śūdras; 6th and 7th correspond to adhyakṣas and amatyas (as in Kautilya&rsquo;s Arthasastra ) and are not really castes but occupations. He probably regards them as castes because the offices of the adhyakṣas and amatyas were generally hereditary or at least he gathered that they were so. Megasthenes' further statement (pp. 43-44 ) that no one is allowed to marry out of his own caste or to exeroise any calling or art except his own' shows that the prevailing tendency was that casto had become exclusive and mostly occupational in bis day, though there must have been excep tions of which he was not informed.</p>
<p>The ancient writers on dharmasastra strive very hard to account for the bewildering ramifioations of the caste system from the four yarpas that were spoken of in the śruti (revela tion). There is unanimity on the theory that the numerous castes actually found in the country arose from the unions of males of different varnas with women belonging to varnas differing from their own. The divergences (and they are</p>
<p>Oh, II</p>
<p>Varna and castes derived therefrom</p>
<p>51</p>
<p>many) among the several smrtikaras relate only to details. The smrti writers had before them the hoary theory of four Varpas youched for by infallible Vedic authority, but they were at the same time quite cognizant of the realities in society viz. the separate existence of numerous castes and Bub-castes that had varying claims es regards social status and that were based in popular estimation on birth alone. Therefore, when one criticizes the smrti view of the derivation of numerous castes from the mixture or confusion ( sankara ) of the four varnas as purely hypothetical and imaginary, the critioism is true only partially. The smrtis were composed in different parts of India at different times and they were meant to supply a popular want, to guide the people and to reflect the prevailing state of society and popular feeling. Therefore, it must be admitted that the numerous castes mentioned in the smptis did exist at the time of the smṛtis, that the social status of the several castes might have varied from country to country or from epoch to epoch, that the peculiar avocations and means of livelihood assigned to the various castes reflected the real state of things. The element of hypothesis and speculation lies only in the theory of a partioular sub-caste having sprung from the union of two persons belonging to two partioular varnas or castes.121 This description of the origin of the several castes was only indicative of the suthor&rsquo;s view or of the accepted view about the social status of those castes in particular looalities. There is here, as a inatter of fact, great divergence of views among the several authors.</p>
<p>In the first placa all writers on dharmagāstra start with the propositions viz. (1) that the four varnas, brahmana, ksatriya, vaisya and sūdra, are arranged in a descending scale of social status ; and (2) that marriage is or was permissible between a male of a higher varpa with a woman of a lower varpa, but the union of a woman of a higher varng with a male of varpa lower than her own is reprehensible and not permitted. Thero is a third proposition advanced by many writers that a man belongs to a particular varṇa or jati by birth only i. e. if born in lawful wedlook of parents both of whom belong to that varpa</p>

<p>or jati. 18 This is the view held by all medieval writers and digests and it is expressly said that a man belongs to a caste by birth and no actions of his can alter that fact, that several castes are like the species of animals and that caste attaches to the body and not to the soul (vide Sūtasambita ). When &amp; male of a higher varṇ&amp; marries &amp; woman of a lower varna, the marriage is said to be anuloma ( lit. with the hair, in the natural order) and the offspring is said to be anuloma ; when there is a union of a woman of a higher varna with a male of a lower Varpa, it is said to be pratiloma ( against the bair, i. a. against the natural or proper order) and the children of the union are said to be pratiloma. These two words anuloma and pratiloma ( as applied to marriage or progeny ) hardly ever occur in the vedic literature. In the Bș. Up. (II. 1. 15 ) and Kausi taki Br. Up. IV. 18 (quoted in note 89 above ) the word * pratiloma' is applied to the procedure adopted by a brāhmana of going to a kṣatriya for knowledge about brahman. From this it may possibly be inferred that pratiloma and anuloma might have been employed with reference to marriages also ( in the days of the Upaniṣad). Panini ( IV. 4. 28 ) teaches the formation of words from anuloma and pratiloma. They occur in Gautama (IV. 14-15 ), Baud. Dh.S.( I. 8. 8), Vasiṣtha ( 18.7), Manu ( X. 13), Yāj. (1. 95 ) and other smrti works.</p>
<p>One important question is whether the theory of anuloma or pratiloma castes presupposes a marriage or only a union ( outside marriage) of &amp; man and a woman. The Ap. Dh, S. (II. 6. 13. 1, 3-4) lays down 123 that a man must marry a virgin of his own varna with the rites prescribed by the sāstras and only the son born of such a marriage is entitled to the privileges and occupation of his father, that sexual intercourse with a woman who has been married by another or on whom the proper ceremonies of marriage are not performed or who</p>

<p>Ch. II] Varna : anuloma and pratiloma castes belongs to another caste is condemned and that the son (and not the daughter ) born of such an union is condemned (through the sin of the parents ). So Apastamba looked with disfavour even on marriages called anuloma. He is entirely silent about anuloma and pratiloma castes. It is no doubt true that most ancient writers like Gautama ( IV. 1), Vasistha ( I. 24), Manu (III. 12-13), Yaj. ( I. 55 and 57 ) prescribe that &amp; person should by preference marry a girl of his own varna but also allow the marriage of a person with a girl of apother varṇa lower than his own. Yāj. (1.92) expressly says that the six anuloma castes, mūrdhāvasikta, ambaṣtha, niṣāda, māhiṣya, ugra, and karana are so called only when they are the offspring of women married by men of higher varpas. Manu (X. 41 ) says that the six anuloma castes are entitled to the rites ( Bamskāras like upanayana ) performed for dvijas, but that the pratiloma castes are like sūdras (i. e. even when a pratiloma oaste springs from a brābmana woman and a ksatriya or vaibya male they cannot have upanayana and other rites of dvijas performed for them, though both parents are dvijas ). Kautilya 184 (III. 7 ) also says that all pratilomas except cāndalas are like sūdras; Viṣnu says that they are condemned by all Aryas. Devala&rsquo;s ( quoted by Parabara. madhaviya I. 2. p. 122 ) says that pratilomas are outside the pale of the system of varnas and are patita. The Smrtyarthasāra p. 13 Axys that anuloma sons and those born of the mūrdhāvesikta and other anuloma castes are dvijātis and are entitled to samskāras as dvijātis. Commentators like Kullāka (on Manu X. 11 ) say that, as no marriage is legally possible between a woman of a bigher varpa and a male of a lower varpa, all the pratilomas are born outside lawful wedlock, Gautama (IV. 20) says that all pratilomas are dharmahina, which is interpreted by the Mit. on Yaj. III. 262 as meaning that they cannot have upana yang and similar samskāras of drijas performed for them, though they are amenable to the rules of morality and entitled to perform vratas and prāyascittas. Vasiṣtha, Baudhayana and several others do not make it olear whether, when they speak of pratilomas, they contemplate offspring of legal</p>

<p>marriages or only of illegitimate and adulterous unions. But it will be seen from the list appended below that Uśanas and Vaikhanasa almost always make a distinotion between the caste assigned to the offspring of the union of parents of different varpas, according as there is a marriage between the two or it is only a clandestine, illegitimate or adulterous union, For example, Uśanas says 18 that when there is a marriage between a ksatriya male and a brāhmapa female, the offspring is oalled gūta, while the offspring of a clandestine union between a brāhmaṇa woman and a ksatriya male was called rathakāra. So these two authors held that there could be a legal marriage when &amp; woman of a higher varpa married a male of a lower yarpa. 187 There were several other works like the Sūtasamhita (Śivamāhātmyakbanda chap. 12. 12-48) where a similar distinction is made between the children of marriages and clandestine unions. The Mit, on Yāj. I. 90 says that such progeny as kunda and golaka (Manu III. 174), kānina, saho dhaja ( who are all not due to intercourse in wedlock) are different from savarpa, anuloma and pratiloma and are to be treated as sūdras and that the kṣetraja son is to be treated as in a different category (since niyoga is allowed by the smrtis and by the usage of sistas ) and belongs to the caste of bis mother. Aparārka ( on Yāj. I. 92 p. 118 ) does not accept this view and holds that even kanina and sahodha may be held to be brāhmaṇas (if the begetter can be proved to have been a brāhmaṇa ); while Viśvarūpa on Yāj. II. 133 says that kanina and gūdhaja must be deemed to belong to the mother&rsquo;s caste as the begetter may not be known and that sahodhaja ( II. 135) is also to be so treated. These several kinds of secondary sons will be treated under inheritance.</p>
<p>A few words must be said about the word jāli. The idea of varna was as we have seen based originally on race, culture, cha. racter and profession. It takes account mainly of the moral and intellectual worth of man and is a system of olasses whioh appears more or less natural. The ideal of varna even in the smstig lays far more emphasis on duties, on a high standard of effort for the community or society rather than on the rights and pri vileges of birth.

<p>birth and heredity and tends to create the mentality of clinging to privileges without trying to fulfil the obligations correspond ing to such privileges. The word &ldquo;jāti' in the sense of caste hardly ever occurs in the vedic literature. In the Nirukta 128 (XII. 13) it is said &lsquo;after agnicayana (the building of the fire altar), 8 man should not approach &amp; rāmā (for sexual intercourse ); rūmā is so called because she is approached only for pleasure and not for ( 8ccumulation of ) merit; she is of a dark caste&rsquo;. Here the word krsnajātigā ocours with reference to a woman of the sūdra caste. Almost these very words occur in Vasiṣtha (18. 17-18 )129 where for krsna jatiya the word kropavarṇā is substituted. Visvarūpa on Yāj. I. 56 ( yad-ucyate sto. )130 quotes these words as a brāhmapa text, but there the word is krsnavsrply. Therefore, the use of the word jāti in the sense of caste can be traced back at least to the times of the Nirukta. Pāṇini (V. 4. 9 )131 teaches the formation of words like &lsquo;brahmanajātiya&rsquo; derived from words ending in &lsquo;jāti&rsquo; (in the sense of caste). The expression &lsquo;jātidharma&rsquo; (rules of castes ) oocurs in Gautama XI. 20, Vasiṣtha I. 17 and XIX. 7, Manu I. 118 and VIII, 41 and the word jāti (caste ) ocours also in Āp. Dh. S. II. 3. 6.1, II. 1.2.3, Manu (IV. 141, X, 11, 18, 40, 97 ), Yāj. (I. 95, 361, II. 69, 206, III. 213), Nārada (rpādana 288 ) and in the vārtika on Pānini IV. 1. 137. Varna and jāti are sometimes clearly distinguished as in Yaj II. 69 and 206. But very often they are confounded. In Manu X. 27,31 the word varna is used in the sense of mixed castes (jatis ). Conversely the word jāti often appears to be used to indicate &lsquo;varṇa &lsquo;Vide Manu III. 15, VIII. 177, IX. 86 and 335, X. 41 and Yāj. I. 89 ( in which latter sajāti appears to mean&rsquo;savarna&rsquo;).</p>
<p>Even when anuloma marriages were allowed there is no unanimity among the sages and the smrtis as to the status of the progeny of such unions. Three different views are found. The first view is that if a male of one varṇa married a female of the varpa immediately after it, the progeny belonged to the varna</p>

<p>of the father; e. g. Baud. Dh. 8,184 (I. 8.6 and I. 9. 3) says that sons born to a person of a savarpa wife or a wife of the varpa next to his own are savarna i. e. the son of a brāhmaṇa from &amp; wife of the ksatriya varna is a brāhmaṇa. The Anusasang parya 48. 4, Nārada (stripuīsa 106 ) and Kautilya (III. 7) gay the same. Gautama IV, 15 as interpreted by Haradatta appears to say that the off-spring of a brāhmaṇa from a kṣatriya wife is called savarna, but not the offspring of a ksatriya male from &amp; vaibya wife or of &amp; vaisya male from &amp; sūdra wife. Fick (pp. 54-57 ) shows that even according to the Bbaddasāla Jataka &lsquo;the family of the mother does not matter; the family of the father alone is important&rsquo;. The second view is that the progeny of anuloma unions is in status lower than the father, but higher than the mother; e. g. Manu X. 6 &lsquo;sages declare the sons begotten by dvijas on wives of varpas immediately next to theirs as similar ( to the fathers, but not of the same varṇa with the fathers ) but tainted by the inferiority of their mothers.&rsquo; The third view (and this is the common view ) is that the progeny of anu loma marriages is of the same varṇa as regards its privileges and obligations as the mother&rsquo;s; e. g. vide Viṣnu Dh. S. 16. 2 188 and Saṅkha (prose) quoted by the Mit, on Yāj I. 91 and Apararka (p. 118 ). A classical echo of this view is found in the Sakuntala of Kālidāsa where king Duṣyanta exclaims aside to himself &lsquo;would that this girl were born of the sage from a wife who was not savarna&rsquo;. Medhātithi on Manu X, 6 says that Pandu, Dhstaraṣtra and Vidura being kṣetraja sons took the caste of their mothers. The Mit, explains the words of Saṅkha by saying that the offspring of anuloma marriages such as mūrdhāvasikta are not really different from kṣatriyas, that they have the same saṁskāras but they do not become kṣatriyas etc. and are dubbed by these names to indicate their mixed origin and come to form separate sub-castes. The pratilomas, as said above, are lower in status than any of the two parents.</p>

<p>Varna and the enumeration of castes</p>
<p>The ancient dharmasūtras mention only a few mixed castes. Ap. Dh, S, mentions only cāndāla, paulkasa and vaipa. Gautama names five anuloma castes, six pratiloma, one and eight others according to the view of some. Baudhāyana adds to those mentioned by Gautama &amp; few more viz rathakira, śvapaka, vaiṇa and kukkuṭa. Vasiṣtha names even a smaller number than Gautama and Baudhāyana. It is Manu ( X) and Visṇu Dh. 8. (XVI) that for the first time dilate upon the avocations of the mixed castes. Manu refers to 6 anuloma, 6 pratiloma and 20 doubly mixed castes and states the avocations of about 23; Yaj. names only 13 castes (other than the four Varpas). Usanas names about 40 and gives their peculiar avocations. All the smrtis taken together hardly mention more than about one hundred castes.</p>
<p>The number of primary anulomas is only six ( vide Manu X. 10, Yaj I. 91-92), but Manu names only three of them, vis. ambastha, niṣāda and ugra. The primary pratilomas also are six ( vide Manu X. 11–12 and 16-17 and Yāj. I. 93–34 ) viz sūta, vaidebaka, cāṇdāls, māgadha, kṣats, and dyogava. Further sub-castes are said to arise from the unions of the anulomas and pratilomas with the four varnas and of the male of one anuloma and the female of another, from the union of pratilomas among themselves and from the union of a male or female of an anuloma caste and the female or male of a pratiloma caste. For example, Yāj. I. 95 defines rathakāra as the offspring of a māhiṣya male and a karana female, i. e. it is a further mixture between two anuloma oastes. The Mit. on Yāj. I. 95 says that upanayana and other sainskāras are performed for the offspring of anuloma persons marrying among themselves. The Smrtyarthasāra (p. 13 ) says the same&rsquo;s. Similarly Manu X, 15 says that avśta and abbira spring from the union of a brahmana with an ugra girl and an ambaṣtha girl respectively ( i. e. from the union of a brābmana with anuloma caste girls ). Manu X. 19 says that syapāka is the offspring of a kṣatṛ male (a pratiloma) with an ugra female (an anuloma ). Manu X 33 defines maitreyaka as the offspring of a vaidehaka male and an dyogava female (i.e. from parents who are both pratiloma). A</p>

<p>smrti verse quoted 128 by Visvarūpa on Yaj. I. 95 says that there are six anulomas, 24 doubly mixed castes ( due to the union of the six anulomas with the four yarpas ), 6 pratilomas and 24 doubly mired castes (due to the unions of 6 pratilomas with four varnas ) i. e, in all 60 and further mixtures of these among themselves give rise to innumerable sub-castes. Similarly Viṣnu Db. 8. 16.7 137 says that the further mixed castes arising from the unions of mixed castes are numberless. This shows that before the time of the Viṣnudharmasūtra (i, e. at least about 2000 years ago) numberless castes and sub-castes had been formed and the writers on dharmasastra practically gave up in despair the task of deriving them, even though mediately, from the primary varnas. The same state of things Wag continued and was rather aggravated by the time of the nibandhakāras. Medhatithi on Manu X. 31 speaks of 60 mixed castes along with the four varṇas and adds that by the inter mingling of these endless sub castes are formed. The Mitakṣara 188 on Yāj. I. 95 observes that since the castes spring ing from the double intermingling of varnas are innumerable, it is impossible to describe or enumerate them. Similarly the Kṛtyakalpataru in its prakirnaka topic of vyavahāra section, when dealing with castes, merely quotes several passages from the smrtis and does not add a word of its own about the castes, their names or avocations in its own day (first half of 12th century ). The Mit. on Yāj. I. 94139 expressly says that the avocations of the pratilomas (about which Yaj. is silent) should be understood from the smśtis of Usanas and Manu. Medieval writers on dharmaśāstra usually ignore the treat ment in detail of the numerous sub-castes and content themselves with dilating upon the duties of the four varpas.</p>
<p>There was great diversity of opinion among the smrtikāras about the derivation and status of the several sub castes. We find that the same subwoaste is known under five or six different names even so early as the present Manusmrti.</p>

<p>Varna and sub castes</p>
<p>59</p>
<p>Manu X. 22 gives seven names for the same caste and Manu X. 23 gives five for another. Vibvarūpa on Yāj. I. 92 explains that these different names are due to difference of locality.&rdquo; There is another difficulty. The same name given to &amp; oaste is differently derived by different writers ( vide under niṣada and pārasava below). For the same sub-caste different names are given in different smṛtis (vide under krta and rāmaka). It beoame difficult to assign any peculiar derivation for groups of people and so Manu (X. 40), Vasiṣtha161 ( 18.7) and Anuśāsana parva 148. 29 laid down that men&rsquo;s sub-caste was to be known from their actions and ocoupations. This shows that according to most writers castes in the times of the smrtis were predominantly occupational,</p>
<p>One word that frequently occurs in connection with castes and sub-castes is varnasankara ( or only sarkara ). In Manu X. 12 and 24 the word varnagamkara is used in the plural in the sense of mixed casteg, wbile in Manu X 40 (and in V. 89) the word sankara seems to be used in the sense of &lsquo;mixture or intermingling of Varnas&rsquo;. Gautama (VIII. 3) employs the word saṛkara and says &lsquo;on the two ( the brābmana and the king ) depends the prosperity of men), protection, the prevention of mixture (of varṇas ) and the ( accumulation of merit (or the observance of dharma ).148 Narada ( stripuṁsa 102 ) 13 says ' to be born from a union in the inverse order of Varnas amounts to varyasankara;&rsquo; while Bphaspati quoted in the Krtyakalpataru appears to apply the word varpasarnkara to both anuloma and pratiloma casteg.

<p>Varnasamkara are called vrūtyas, The Mit. on Yaj I. 96 applies the word varnasamkara to both anuloms and pratiloms progeny. Medhātithills on Manu V. 88 says that the word ' samkarajāta&rsquo; indicates pratilomas like āyogava and that even though as regarda anulomas there is intermingling (of varnas ), yet as they have the privileges of the caste of their mothers, even Manu himself does not apply the word samkirnayoni to them as been above ( Manu X. 25). Yama'46 quoted in the Kityakal. pataru says &lsquo;Varnagarkara arises by the violation of the res trictions ( about marriage); if the proper order of varnas ( i. e. male of higher varṇa marrying a woman of a lower varna) is followed, (the offspring) is entitled to be regarded as belonging to the system of varṇas, but if the reverse order is followed it is sin.&rsquo; Manu ( X. 24 ) says &lsquo;mixed castes arise by members of one varna baving sexual intercourse with women of another varna, by marrying women who ought not to have been married (such as &amp; sagotra girl) and by neglect of the duties peculiar to one&rsquo;s varna&rsquo;. The Anuśāganaparve 48. 1148 remarks that &lsquo;varnasamkara arises from wealth, greed, desires, unoertainty about the varpa ( of a person) or ignorance about varna&rsquo;, Even in such &amp; philosophical treatise as the Bhagavad-gita ( I. 41-43 ), it is said &lsquo;when women become corrupt (or demo ralised ), intermingling of varnas arises ; saṁkara necessarily leads the whole family and the destroyer of the family to hell. By reason of these transgressions of the destroyers of families which bring about varnasamkara, the ancient casto observances and family observances are subverled.&rsquo;</p>
<p>On account of the great emphasis laid on the prevention of varnasaṛkara the smrtis ordain that it is one of the principal duties of the king to punish people if they transgress the rules prescribed for varṇas and to punish men and women if guilty of varnasımkara. Gautama (XI. 9-10) says the king should protect the varṇas and āārainas according to the gāstras and be should make them conform to their duties when they swerve</p>

<p>from them;&rsquo; Vasiṣtha (19, 7-8) &lsquo;the king paying attention to all these viz. the observances of countries, castes and families should make the four varnas conform to their duties and should punish them when they go astray&rsquo;; Viṣnu Dh. 8. III. 3 and Yaj I. 361, Mārkandeyapuārṇa 27, Matsyapurāṇa 215. 63 say the same. Nārada ( stripuasa 113 ) 148 says * when &amp; brāhmaṇa woman goes astray a cāṇdāla is born from a sūdra male (and the brāhmaṇa woman); therefore the king should specially protect women from sarkara'. It is on account of this that so early as in the first centuries of the Christian era we see that king Vasithiputa Siri Pulumāyi is extolled as having prevented the mixture of the four varṇas ( E. I. vol. VIII pp. 60-61, &lsquo;vinivatitacātuvaṇa-sakarasa ). That Varnasamkørs had gone too far in the opinion of the author of the Mahabharata (Vanaparva 180. 31-33 ) follows from the following words which are despairingly put in the mouth of Yudhisthira 149 &ldquo;It appears to me that it is very difficult to ascertain the caste of human beings on account of the confusion of all varnas; all sorts of men are always begetting offspring from all sorts of women; speech, sexual intercourse, being born and death-these are common to all human beings; and there is scriptural authority (for this view) in the words &lsquo;We, who ever we are, offer the sacrifice&rsquo;. Hence those who have seen the truth regard character as the principal thing desired.&rdquo; Samkarācārya in his bhāṣya on Vedantasūtra I. 3. 33 remarks that, though in his day varṇas and asramas had become disor ganised and unstable as to their dharmas, that was not the caso in other ages, sinoe otherwise the kāstras laying down regulations for them would have to be deemed purposeless or futile.150</p>
<p>Gautama (IV. 18-19), Manu ( X, 64-65 ) and Yāj. (I. 96 ) speak of a paouliar doctrine called Jūlyutkarṣa and Jūtyapakarṣa. These passages have given rise to some divergence of interpreta</p>

<p>tion, but their general sense is clear. Gautama (IV. 18 ) 151 says that according to the Scāryas the anulomas when they marry in such a way that the bridegroom in each stage is higher or lower than the bride they rise to a higher or go down to &amp; lower varpa in the 7th or 5th generation ( respectively ). This is explained by Haradatta as follows: When a brāhmapa marries a kṣatriya woman the daughter born of this marriage is called savarnā; if this latter is married to a brāhmaṇa and &amp; daughter is born and this latter is again married by a brāhmaṇa and if this continues in the same way for seven generations, then when the 7th girl in descent marries &amp; brahmana, whatever child is born of that union belongs to the brāhmaṇa varna (though in the preceding generations only the fathers were brāhmaṇas and the mothers were all not strictly brāhmaṇas, but only savarnās if at all). This is called jālyutkarṣa (rise in status as a caste). On the other hand, when a brāhmaṇa marries a kṣatriga girl and a son is born who is called savarna, then that son marries a kṣatriya girl and has a son and this is continued for five generations, then when the fifth son (in descent ) marries a ksatriya girl, the child born belongs to the ksatriya varpa (though in all the preceding generations the father was higher than kṣatriya and the mother only was a kṣatriya). This is jātyapakarṣa ( fall in status as a caste). The same rule holds good as regards a kṣatriya marrying a vaisya female and e vaisya marrying &amp; sūdra female. The same rule applies among anulomas also e. g. if a savarna (as defined by Gautama ) marries an ambagtha girl and a daughter is born who again marries &amp; savarna and this continues for seven generations, then the child of the 7th girl ( in descent) from a savarna male becomes &amp; savarna ( rises in status); on the other hand if a savarna ( offspring of brāhmaṇa male and kṣatriya female ) marries an ambaṣtha girl and &amp; son is born and that son marries an ambaṣtha girl and their son marries an ambaṣtha girl and this goes on for seven generations, then the child of</p>

Though this method makes a good sense it is opposed to the explanation of Haradatta, who explains that the option allowed by the use of &lsquo;v&amp;&rsquo; in the sutra applies only where there is pro-ominonco of cbaracter and lourning (i. e. in such a capo riso is possible oven in the 5th geboration )</p>

<p>63</p>
<p>the 7th male (in descent ) born of an ambastha wife becomes an ambaṣtha ( i. e. there is jātyapakarga as to anulomas ).</p>
<p>According to Manu'58 X. 64 when &amp; brāhmaṇa marries &amp; sūdra woman, the daughter born is pāraśava, and if this pāraśava daughter marries &amp; brāhmaṇa and the daughter of this latter union marries a brāhmaṇa and this continues for seven generations, then the seventh generation will be a brahmana ( i, e, there will be jātyutkarṣa ), Conversely, if a brāhmaṇa marries &amp; sūdra woman and a son is born, he is &amp; pārasaya and that son marries &amp; sūdra woman and their son again marries a sūdra woman and this goes on for 7 generations, the 7th generation becomes a mere sūdra ( there is jātyapakarṣa ). It will be seen that this differs from Gautama in several respecte. In the first place for both jātyutkarsa and jātyapakarṣa seven generations are prescribed, while in Gautama they are 7 and 5 respectively (according to Haradatta). In the second place according to Gautama the 8th in descent from the first anuloma marriage secures jātyutkarṣa, while according to Manu, the 7th secures it. Further Manu is silent about jātyutkarsa when the original parents are anulomas. Besides, the commentators of Manu shorten the period for rige or fall in jati as stated below. Manu X. 65 extends the game rules to the offspring of the marriage of a kṣatriya with a vaisya woman and of a vaibya with a sūdra wonian, Medhātithi and Kullūka extend these express words of Manu further by explaining that if a brahmana marries a vaisya female and a daughter is born and she again marries &amp; brahmana then in the fifth generation there will be jātyutkarṣ&amp; ; conversely if &amp; son is born from a brāhmaṇa and a vaibya wife, and he marries</p>

<li>The word &ldquo;yuga ' is understood by Medbātitbi (on Madu X. 64) and Kullaka to mean &ldquo;jadma'; Sarvajõ&amp;-Dūrūyaga understands it to moan &lsquo;yugma&rsquo; (pair of spouses ). The meaning (yugina ) is attached to &lsquo;yuga&rsquo; by A parārka on Yoj. I. 96 (p. 119). In the S. B. E. vol. II p. 196 Dr. Bobler compares Āp. Dh. $. II. 5.10. 10-11 with Gautama IV. 22. But the great scholar is not accurate here, Ap. does not speak of progeny of mixed marriages rising to higher status or being degraded to lower status after several generations ; he rather spoaks of . $Odre rising bigher and higher in successive births. In the Anugasana parva (chap. 27. 5-6, 28. 6-13) it is said that after numberless births sūdras and others beooine vaidyas and 80 on. Vana parva (212. 11-12) gives expression to the samo iden सपोमो हि जातस्म सगुणाहपतिष्ठतः। श्यत्वं लभते बान क्षत्रियत्वं तथैव च। भाजी dari ponsel werf 212. 11-18.</li>

<p>a vaibya female and this goes on, then in the fifth generation the son will be &amp; vaibya (1. e. there will be jātyapakarsa ) Similarly if a brāhmaṇa marries a kṣatriya woman then there is jātyutkarga or jātyspakarṣa in three generations.</p>
<p>Yajñavalkya ( I. 96 ) 158 speaks of two kinds of jātyrutkarṣa or jūlyapakarṣa viz. one due to marriage (as in Manu and Gautama) and another due to the avocation followed. It should be understood that there is rise in caste in the 7th or even in the 5th generation; if there is inversion as to the avocations, then there is corresponding similarity (of varpa in the 7th or even 5th generation). This is elaborated by the Mitakṣarā as follows: If a brahmana marries a śūdra woman and a daughter is born she is a niṣādi; if this latter marries a brāhmaṇa and a daughter is born and she in turn marries a brāhmaṇa and this goes on for six generations, then the child of the 6th girl (in descent ) becomes a brāhmaṇa ( he being 7th in descent); similarly if a brāhmaṇa marries a vaibga woman and a girl is born, she is an ambaṣtha ; if the latter marries a brāhmana and a daughter is born and this goes on in the same way, then the fifth girl in descent has a child ( from a brābmaṇa husband) which is the 6tb in descent from the original anuloma marriage and which then becomes a brāhmaṇa. If a brāhmaṇa marries &amp; ksatriya woman and a daughter is born who is called mūrdhāvasiktā (Yāj. I. 91 ) and she marries a brāhmaṇa, then the fourth in descent marrying a brāhmaṇa has a child (5th in descent), then that child becomes a brābmana. Similarly, if a kṣatriya married a śūdra female and a daughter was born, she was called ugra, then jātyutkarsa by marrying a higher male took place in the 6th generation, If &amp; ksatriya married a vaiśya woman, the daughter born was a mahiṣya and jātyutkarṣa took place in the 5th generation, If a vaiśye married a sūdra woman, the daughter of the marriage is &amp; karani and if she marries &amp; vaisya, then in the fifth generation there would be jātyutkarṣa. Certain peculiar avocations and activities are prescribed for the four varpas, Each varṇa may in times of difficulty follow the ocoupation peculiar to the caste immediately below it, but should not follow the avocations peculiar to the higher varnas ; 184 he must however revert to his proper avocation when the difficulty is</p>

<p>over (vide Vasistha II. 13-23, Visnu Dh. 8. II. 15, Yaj. I. 118-120, Gautama X. 1-7 &amp;c.). If a brāhmaṇa begins to follow the avocations peculiar to a sūdra and has a son, who does the same and this goes on continuously for seven generations, the 7th becomes a sūdra (by caste ). If a brābmana begins to follow the avocations peculiar to a vaibya or a kṣatriya then in the 5th or 6th generation respectively there is fall in oaste (i,e, the 5th or 6th becomes respectively a vaisya or ksatriya). Similarly if a kṣatriya follows the avocation of a vaisya or sūdra and this goes on continuously, then the 5th or 6th (respectively ) becomes a sūdra or vaisya. Similarly if a vaisya takes to the work peculiar to sūdras, then the fifth generation becomes sūdra,</p>
<p>Baud. 355 Dh, 8. ( I. 8. 13-14) gives another illustration of jātyutkarṣa. He says &ldquo;if a niṣāda (the son of a brāhmann from &amp; sūdra wife) marries &amp; niṣādi (and this goes on continuously ), then the fifth generation becomes free of the taint of a sūdra status, he can have upanayana performed for him and his son (6th from the original niṣāda pair) can have a vedio sacrifice performed for him.'</p>
<p>These provisions would considerably lessen the rigour of the caste system based purely on birth. But one feels grave doubts whether such a method of jātyutkarṣa or jatyapa karṣa (particularly the one based on ocoupation) was or could be ever enforced in actual life. It would have been impossible to remember descent in a particular way for five or seven genera tions. The want of unanimity among the original smrtikāras and the commentators also points in the direction that the method advocated, though it might have originally some slight basis in fact, was only a hypothesis and an ideal. Hardly any examples of jātyutkarsa in the way set out by Manu or Yaj. ooour in the literature on dharma-sāstra or in insoriptions. In the inscriptions we have authentic cases of intercaste marriages only, but hardly anything further 18. From the Talgunda pillar inscription of king Kakusthavarman of the Kadamba family we learn that the Kadambas were originally of brāb maṇa lineage, that the founder of the family was &amp; brāhmana</p>

<p>Mayurasarman, who became exasperated with the Pallavas of Kāñcipura and took up the sword to conquer the earth, that his descendants applied the affix &lsquo;Varman&rsquo; to their names (as if they were ksatriyss, according to Manu II. 32) and Kakustha Varman (4th in descent from Mayurasarman) married his daughters to Gupta and other kings 187. This shows that an originally brāhmaṇa family came to look upon itself as ksatriya by virtue of pursuing the profession of arms and governing the people. In the Mahabhārata we meet with stories of kings who became brālmaṇas. For example, Anugasana 30 speaks of Vitahavya, a king, as having become a brāhmaṇa; similarly Salya ( 39. 36-37) speaks of Aratisena, Sindhudvipa, Devāpi and Viśvāmitra as having become brāhmaṇas at a sacred spot on the Sarasvati. In the Purāṇas also there are stories 158 of kings like Viśvāmitra, Mandhātā, Samkṣti, Kapi, Vadhryasva, Purukutsa, Arstisena, Ajamidha and others as having risen to the status of brāhmaṇas. These are mythical sages and their rise is not stated to have been due to the prin ciple of jātyutkarṣa 159. Ibbetson (Report on the census of the Punjab 1881, pp. 174-176) notes that brahmanas following certain professions became degraded and that the caste was changed.</p>
<p>That the professional castes were wealthy and well organized follows from the dharmaśāstra works and epigraphic records. In this connection the words śreni, pūga, gana, vrāta and sangha deserve to be carefully studied. All these were called samūha (group) or varga according to Kātyāyana.160 These</p>

<p>Varna: caste and other guilds</p>
<p>67</p>
<p>words ocour in the Vedio literature, but the sense is generally ' a group' and there is no special meaning attached. &ldquo;Srepi' occurs in the Rg. I. 163. 10 161 (like flamingoes the horses press forward in rows or groups ); both vrāta and gaña occur in Rg. III. 26. 6, V, 53. 11 and in numerous other places. The Kausi taki Br. 16.7 16% speaks of Rudra as pūga ( as he is the hoad of the band of Maruts). Ap. Dh. . I. 1. 3. 26163 quotes a Brāh. mana passage about a group (sangha ) of brabmacārins going about for alms. Pāṇini teaches 184 the formation of derivatives from pūga, gana, sangha (V. 2. 52), from vrata (V. 2. 21 ). In his time it appears the words had acquired specific meanings. The Mahābhāṣya explains ( on Pāṇini V, 2.21 ) that vrātas are groups formed by men of various castes with no fixed means of livelihood but subsisting by the might (or strength ) of their bodies (by bodily labour of various kinds). The Kāśika185 explains pūgas as associations of men of different castes with no fixed professions, who are solely bent on making money or seeking pleasure, Kautilya in one place distinguishes between soldiers and bropis ( guilds ) and in another place says that the guilds of kṣatriyas in Kambhoja and Surāṣṭra subsist by the profession of arms and vārtā ( agriculture ).188 Vas. Dh. 8. XVI. 15 says that boundary disputes are to be settled by the evidence of the old men in the village or town or of guilds (śreni) when there is conflict of documentary evidence. Viṣnu Dh. S. V. 167 prescribes banishment for him who embezzles the wealth of associations ( gaña) and who transgresses the conventions made by them. Manu (VIII. 219 ) has a similar rule about village and local associations (sangha). The above words are variously explained by the several commen</p>

Katyāyana says &lsquo;Naigama is an association of citizens of the same city, vrata is a company of soldiers carrying various arms, pūga is an association of traders and the like, gana is a group of brahmaṇas, sangha is &amp; body of Bauddhas or Jainas; and bands of oāndalas and kvapacas are called gulma.&rsquo; Yāj. ( I. 361 ) directs the king to punish kulas, castes, āreṇis, ganas, if they tranggress their rules (of conduot or business) and the Mit, explains sreṇi 88 a guild of sellers of betel leaves and the like and gaña &amp;8 of &lsquo;helabukas&rsquo; (horse-dealers ); while Yāj. II. 192 and Nārada 188 ( samayasyānapākarma ) require the king to prevent the breach of the conventions of frepi, naigama, pūga, vrata, gana and to confirm them in their traditional occupations. Yāj. II. 30 says that pūgas and trenis had authority to investigate dis putes and that the pūga was a higher tribunal than the froṇi. The Mit, on this explains that pūga is an association of people of diffe rent castes and different occupations that stay in one locality, while a froṇi is a group of people of different castes, that subsist by the occupation of one caste and gives &lsquo;hedabukas&rsquo; tambū. likas' (betel sellers ), ' kuvindas &lsquo;( weavers ) and &lsquo;carmakāras (shoe-makers ) as examples of sreṇis. In the Harṣa stone of Chabamāna Vigraharāja (E, I. vol. II. p. 124) there is a reference to one dramma for each horse given to &lsquo;hedāvikas.&rsquo; In the Nasik Inscription No. 15 (E. I. vol. VIII p. 88 ) we are told that in the reign of the Abhira king Iśvarasena 1000 karṣāpaṇas were deposited with an association of potters as a permanent donation yielding interest, 500 with a guild of oilmen and 2000 with a guild of watermen ( uda ka-yantra-sreṇi ) for medicines to be given to sick bhikṣus. No. 9 and No. 12 of the inscriptions at Nasik also contain reference to deposits of money with the guild of weavers. The Mathurā Brahmi insoription of Huviśka&rsquo;s reign mentions a guild of flour-makers ( sam itakara, vide E. I. vol. 21 p. 55 at p. 61). The Junnar Buddhist cave Inscription (A. 8. W. I. vol.

Similarly it is said that a guild of silk weavers from Lāṭa (southern Gujerat ) caine to Dajapura ( Dasor in Malwa ) and built a temple of the sun in the Mālava year 494 i. e. 437-38 A. D. (O. I. I. vol. III p. 81 = I. A, vol. 15 p. 194). These examples show that about the first centuries of the Christian era such castes as woodworkers, oilmen, betel sellers and weavers that are at present very low in the hierarchy of castes had very efficient caste guilds, so famous for their organization, integrity and stability that people deposited with them thousands for permanent services to objects of charity, 169</p>
<p>We shall now append a list of several castes enumerated or mentioned in smrti and other dharmaśāstra works from about 500 B. C. to 1000 A. D. in alphabetical (Sanskrit) order. They are not given in a tabular form owing to numerous contradictory statements in the smṛtis themselves. References are given only to a few smrtis, the principal ones drawn upon being the Dharmasūtras, Manu, Yaj., Vaik. smārta-sutra X 11-15, Uśanas, the Sūtasambita (Siva-mahatmya-khaṇda obap. 12). It is hoped that the list is fairly exhaustive for the smrti period. It will be noticed that many of the caste names collected here still occur under the same forms or under slightly modified forms of the names.</p>
<p>Andhra. Vide above note 118 quoting the Ait. Br. Manu X. 36 says it was a low subcaste sprung from Vaidehaka father and Kārāvara mother and that Andhras were to live outside the village and to subsist (X. 48 ) by killing wild beasts. In the edicts of Asoka the Andhras ara associated with Pulindas ( vide Rook Ediot No, 13). The Udyogaparve ( 160. 103 ) mentions Andhras (probably as people of Andhradeśa ) along with Dravidas and Kāñoyas. In the Nālanda plate of Devapāladeva (E. I. vol. 17 p. 321 ) meda, andhraka apd cāndala are spoken of as the lowest oastes. In Orissa one scheduled caste is noted as Adi-Andhra ( vide Sob. O.O. 1936 ).</p>
<p>Antya. According to Vas. Dh. S. 16.30, Manu IV. 79, VIII. 68, YAJ. I. 148, 197, Atri 251, Likhita 92, verse Apastamba (IIL 1 ) this word is a generic appellation for all lowest oastes</p>

<p>Antyaja. This word is applied to all lowest castes like the cāndāla in Manu IV. 61, Viṣṇu Dh. S. 36.7, Yāj. I. 273, Bșhad yama ( quoted in Mit. on Yāj. III. 260). In Manu VIII. 279 the word is used in the sense of sūdra&rsquo;. Various enumerations of the subdivisions of antyajas are found in the smṣtis. Atri 199 enumerates! BOVER antyajas viz. rajaka (washerman ), carmakāra ( worker in hides ), nata (dancer caste, represented in the Deccan by Kolhātis ), buruda ( worker in bamboos ), kaivarta (fisherman ), meda, bhilla. This verse is quoted as Āpastamba&rsquo;s by the Mit. on Yāj. III. 265, while Apararka p. 1123 asoribes it to Atri. The Mit. on Yāj. III. 260 distinguishes between two groups of antyajas, viz. the one quoted above which it says is not so low as another group of seven, which are called antyāvasūyins, 171 viz. cāṇdāla, śvapaoa (eater of dog flesh ), kṣats, sūta, vaidehika, māgadha and dyogave. In the Mahābhārata (Santi 101. 19 ) reference is made to antyaja soldiers and Nilakantha explains that they were the kaivartas and bhillas of the border regions. According to the Sarasvati. vilāsa (p. 74) Pitāmaha speaks of the seven castes of rajaka and others as prakstis.178 Is it possible that the Prākṣta languages were originally so called because they were spoken by these castes called prakṣtis? In the Sangamner plate of Bhillama II dated sake 922 (E. I. vol. II. p. 220 ) a village is granted with eighteen prakstis ( meaning probably the eighteen guilds of washermen and others ). The Viramitrodaya ( vyavahāra p. 12 ) explains that froṇis mean the eighteen low castes such as the rajaka. This shows that these low castes had risen in social status in the medieval ages by their organization and</p>

Manu IV.79 separately mon tions&rsquo;antyas' and &lsquo;antyāvasāyins&rsquo; and Manu X. 39 says that the antyāvasāgin is the offspring of &amp; oāṇdala male from a nisāda female, that he is condemned even by all &lsquo;bāhyas&rsquo; (untouchables ) and stays in a cemetery. Gautama 20.1 and 23, 32 mentions &ldquo;antyā vasāyin (and -yini). Vas. Dh. S. 18. 3 holds that the antyāvasāyin is the offspring of a sūdra from a vaibya woman. The Bhāradvāja-srauta sutra (XI. 22. 12) forbids the study of the Veda in the presence of the antyava sāyin. The Anusasana-parva ( 22.22) epeaks of Medas, Pulkasas and Antāvasāgins (the printed text is corrrupt). Sānti (141. 29-32) gives a graphic description of a hamlet of cāṇdālas and calls them &lsquo;antyāvasaya&rsquo; (in verse 41 ). Nārada (rpādāna 182 ) says that an antyāvasāyin is not eligible as a witness. Some modern works like the Jātiviveka (D.O.

<p>Abhiṣikta - See under Mūrdhāvasikta. Ambaṣtha - (same as Bbsijakantha ).</p>
<p>In Ait. Br. (chap. 39. 7) king Ambaṣthya is said to have performed an Aśramedha saorifice. In Pāṇ. VIII. 3. 97 the word Ambastia is derived and on Pān. IV.1.170 Ambaṣthya (king ?) is cited by Pat, as an example derived from Ambaṣtha (&amp; country ). It is a question whother the oaste of Ambaṣthas derived its name froin a country. Karnaparva (6. 11) mentions a king Ambaṣtha. In Baud. Dh. S. I. 9. 3, Manu X. 8, Yāj. I. 91, Usanas 31, Nārada ( stripumsa v. 107) Ambaṣtha is an anuloma sprung from the marriage of a brāhmaṇa with a vaibya woman, while according to Gautama 4. 14 as interpreted by Haradatta he is the offspring of a kṣatriya from a vaisya woman. Manu X. 47 prescribes the profession of medicine for him and Uśanas 174 ( 31-32 ) says that he may subsist by agriculture or may be a fire-dancer or he may be a herald (? banner proclaimer)</p>

<p>Avarita. Devala quoted by Aparārka (p. 118 on Yāj. I. 92) says that he is born of the illegitimate connection between a married woman and a male of the same caste and he becomes &amp; sūdra. The Śūdra-kamalakara 175 (p. 247) cites from the Smpti kaumudi a verse of the Adityapurāṇa to the same effect.</p>
<p>Avira. According to the Sūtasamhita he is the offspring of &amp; clandestine union between a kṣatriya male and a vaisya female.</p>
<p>Apita. According to the Sūtasamhita he is the offspring of brāhmaṇa from a Daugyanti.</p>
<p>Abhira. According to Manu X. 15 he is the child of the union of a brāhmaṇa with an ambaṣtha girl. The Mahabhārata ( Mausalaparva 7. 46-63 and 8. 16-17) states that the abhiras were dasyris and mlecchas who attacked Arjuna after the great war in the land of the five rivers and carried away Vrobi women. The Sabhāparya (51.12 ) mentions abhiras with Pāradas and the Aśvamedhika ( 29. 15-16 ) says ( just as Manu X. 43-44 do ) that the Abhiras, the Dravidas and others became kūdras by non-contact with brāhmaṇas. The Mahābhāṣya expressly states that the abbiras are not &amp; subcaste inoluded under the genus sūdra but that they are a caste distinct from sūdras. 176 The Kamasutra (V. 5. 30) names an abhira king Kottarāja.

The Abbiras became absorbed in Hindu society and we find that an Abbira senāpati Rudrabbūti in the year 103 (181-82 A. D.) under king Rudrasimha, son of Rudradāman, built a well (E. I. vol. 16 p. 235 ) and in the Nasik cave No. 15 there is an inscription of king Isvaradena, a son of Abbira Sivadatta and Madhari ( i. e. the mother was of the Mathara gotra ). Vide E.

<p>Ayogava. Vide Ayogū above (p. 43) from Vedio literature. According to Gaut. IV, 15, Viṣnu Dh. S. 16. 4, Manu X. 12, Kauṭ. III. 7, Anuśāsana 48. 13, Yaj. I. 94 this is a pratiloma caste sprung from the union of a sūdra male and a vaisya female; while Baud. Dh. S. (I. 9.7), Uganas 12, Vaik, X. 14 say that it springs from the union of a vaisya male and &amp; ksatriya female. Vas. Dh. 8. (18,3 ) gives antydvasāyin as the name of the caste sprung from a śūdra male and a vaisya female and pulkasa as the name of one sprung from a vaisya male and s ksatriya female. His avooation (Manu X 48) is to pare wood, while Uśanas ( verse 13 ) says he is a weaver or subsists by making vessels of bronze or by cultivating paddy or by dealing in cloth. According to Viṣṇu Dh. S. 16. 8 and Agnipurāṇa (151. 15 ) he is to make his living by going to the stage. The Sahyadrikhanda says ( 26. 68-69 ) that he works in stones and brioke, makes pavements and whitewasheg walls i. e, he is the modern Pātharvata ( in the Deccan).</p>
<p>Avantya. Same as Bhūrjakantha ( Manu X. 21).</p>
<p>Afrika. According to Vaik. X. 12 he is the child of a olandestine union betweon &amp; ksatriya male and a vaisya female and deals in horses.</p>
<p>Ahindika. According to Manu X. 37 he is the offspring of a niṣada male from a vaidehi female i. e. he is a double pratiloma oaste. Kullaka says that his avocation according to Uśanas is to prevent strangers from trespassing on places where offenders are kept imprisoned. Manu X. 36 shows that the same caste is called Kārāvara when it follows the oraft of a oarmakāra.</p>
<p>Ugra. For Vedic reference see above (p. 45). According to Baud. Db. S. (I. 9.5), Manu X,9, Kauṭ. III.7, Yaj. I. 92, Anuśksana 48, 7 be is an anuloma offspring of a ksatriya male from a būdra</p>

<p>woman, while according to Uśanas ( verse 41 ) he is the offspring of the union of a brāhmaṇa with a sūdra woman. The Ap. Dh.8. (I. 2. 7. 20 ) allows a pupil to bring wealth from a sūdra or an ugra when the teacher is in distress or diffioulties. Gaut. 4. 14 ( as explained by Haradatta ) says that ugra is the offspring of &amp; vaisya from a gūdra female. The Ap. Dh. 8. ( I 6. 18. 1 ) says that a brāhmaṇa may accept the gift of money, corn like paddy, flesh of deer, house, field, hay for oxen from an ugra. Manu X. 49 says that the ugra should subsist by oatching and killing animals that hide in holes, while Usanas ( verse 41 ) states that he is to be the staff-bearer of the king and to carry out the punishments inflicted on offenders. Vide Vaik, 10. 13. According to the Sahyadrikhanda and Sūdrakamalakara (p. 255 ) he is called &lsquo;Rajpūta&rsquo;. In the Jātiviveka ( the D. O. collection of 1887-1891 No. 347 ) he is called Rāvut.</p>
<p>Udbandhaka. Acoording to Ubanas (verse 15 ) he is the offspring of the union of a sūnika and a kṣatriya woman, subsists by washing clothes and is an untouchable. Vaik. 10, 15 says he is the offspring of a khanska and a kṣatriya woman.</p>
<p>Upakruṣta. According to Asv. śr. sutra (II. 1) he does not belong to the dvijātis, but is authorised to perform the vedic rite of agnyādheya and the commentary explains that he is a vaisya following the profession of a carpenter.</p>
<p>Odra. Vide Manu X. 43-44. Odra is a country correspond ing more or less to modern Orissa. Most of the names of people mentioned in Manu X. 44 are derived from countries. Vide note on Khasa (p. 79) and see Sabhāparva 51, 23.</p>
<p>Katakāra. According to Usanas ( 45 ) and Vaik, 10, 13 he is the offspring of a clandestino union between &amp; vaibye and &amp; sūdra female,</p>
<p>Karana. According to Gaut. (IV. 17 the view of some Acāryas) and Yaj. I. 92, he is the child of the marriage of &amp; vaisya and a sūdra woman (i. e. he is an anuloma ). Manu (X. 2% ) says that a ksatriya who is &amp; vrātya (i. e. for whom no upanayana has been performed ) has from a similar woman &amp; child variously called Jhalla, Malla, Nicoivi (Licohivi?), Nata, Karana, Khaba, Dravida. Adiparva 115. 43 tells us that Dhstarāstra had from &amp; vaisya female a karana son named Yuyutsu, Kṣtrasyāmi on Amara says tbat karapa also denotes a group of officers like kayasthas and adhyakṣas (superintend ents). The Sahyadrikhanda (26. 49-51 ) says he is the same as</p>

<p>Karmakāra. Visṇu Dh. 8. (51. 14) montions this oaste. It is most probably the same as karmārs. But Saṅkha ( prose ) quoted by Aparārka p. 115 separately mentions in the same passage karmakāra and karmāra,</p>
<p>Karmāra. For vedio references vide (p. 43) above. This caste appears in the gapa kulaladi (Pān. IV. 3. 118). Manu IV. 215 mentions it. In Bengal the Lohar is &amp; scheduled caste ( vide Sch. O.O. 1936 ).</p>
<p>Kāisyakāra. ( modern kāmsāra in Marathi) Mentioned by Nārada (śṇādāna 274 ) and Viṣṇu Dh. S, X 4 in connection with the balance ordeal.</p>
<p>Kakavaca. Mentioned in Uśanas (50) as doing the work of bringing grass for horses.</p>
<p>Kamboja. Vide Manu X. 43-44. The oountry of Kamboja was known to Yaska ( Nirukta II. 2) and Pāṇini ( IV. 1. 175 ). Udyogaparva 160. 103, Droṇa 121. 13 mention Kambojas with Sakas. Vide under Yavana.</p>
<p>Kayasthan 17Heated controversies have røged in medi. eval and modern times about the origin and status of kāyasthas and the bitterness is refleoted in the decisions of the Indian courts also. In Bholanath v. Emperor178 the Caloutta High Court held that the kāyasthas of Bengal were sūdras and went so far as to hold that a kayastha could marry &amp; Dom female. But in Asita Mohan v. Nirode Mohani7s the Privy Counoil left open the question whether the kāyasthas of Bengal were sūdras. On the other hand in Tulsi Ram v. Bihari Lal180 and in Ishwari Prasad v. Rai Hari Prasad181 the Allahabad and Patna High Courts respectively held that the kāyasthas were dvijas and not sūdrag. In Subrao v. Radha 52 Bom. 497 at p. 504-506 this conflict of decisions is referred to. . The word kayastha does not ooour in the anoient dharma. sūtras of Gautama, Apastamba, Baudhāyana, or Vasiṣtha nor</p>

<p>In the Manusmrti. The Viṣnu Dh. 8. VII. 3 defines a publio dooument (rajasaksika) as one written in the royal court or office by a kayastha appointed by the king and attested by the hand of the superintendent of the office. 188 These words suggest that the kāyastha was an officer and that there is nothing about a oaste here. Yāj. I. 322 calls upon the king to protect the subjects from the harassment of cātas ( rogues ), thieves, bad characters, desperadoss and the like and partioularly of kāyasthes. The Mit. explains that kāyasthas are accountants and soribes, are favourites of the king and very cunning. Usanas 188 ( 35 ) holds the kāyasthas to be &amp; caste and gives an uncomplimen tary derivation of the name by saying that it is compounded of the first letters of kaka (orow), Yama and sthapati to convey the three attributes of greed, cruelty and the spoliation (or paring), characteristio of the three. The Veda-Vyāga sost1184 ( 1. 10-11) includes the kāyastha among sūdras along with barbers, potters and others. Sumantu quoted in the Par. M, II part I p. 383 makes the food of &amp; lekhaka along with that of oilmen and others unfit for a brahmanaloLekhaka is obviously a caste here, but whether it is the kāyastha caste is doubtful. Bphas pati as quoted in the Smptioandrika ( vyavahāra ) speaks of the ganaka and lekhaka as two persons to be associated with a judge in a court of justice and says they were to be dvijas. Vide also Aparārka p. 600. Therefore both these were only officers and not members of a particular caste. In the Mșochakaṭika (Act IX) &amp; breṣthin and kāyastha are associated with the judge. So the kāyastha seems to be the same as the lekhaka of Bphaspati and as a mere offioial. In the first centuries of the Christian ere the kdyastha was merely an officer and the word was possibly derived from or is &amp; Sanskrit approximation of some foreign word for an officer, though in some parts of the country (as shown by Ubanas and Veda-Vyāsa ) the kāyasthas also had come to form &amp; oaste in medieval times.</p>

<p>Varna: kāyastha</p>
<p>Though numerous officers are mentioned in the inscriptions of the first five or six centuries of the Christian era, the kāyastha hardly ever figures among them. One of the earliest inscrip tions where the word kāyastha ocours is the Kanaswa Inscription of Sivagana dated in the Mālava era 795 (i. e. 738-39 A, D.). Vide I. A. vol. 19 pp. 56 and 59. See also E. I. vol. X. p. 79 for Kayastha Kāñoana in Balera plates in 994-95 A. D., E. I. vol. XI. p. 149 for Śāsanika kāyastha in Naraspatam plates of 1045-46 A. D., E. I. vol. XI. p. 20,25 for kāyastha Surāditya who was &lsquo;Sarvaśkstravit&rsquo;in Govindacandra&rsquo;s plate dated 1129-30 A. D., E. I. 19 pp. 209, 213 Amodā plate dated 1161 A. D. (for Vāsta vya kāyastha ), E. I. vol. 19 p. 45 Inscription of Hammira ( dated 1288-89 A. D. ), E. I. XII. P. 46 ( dated 1328-29 A. D. for Mathura kāyastha), E. I. 20 Appendix No. 442 p. 64 ( for Gauda kayastha ). In the Rājatarangiol ( VIII. 131 ) kāyasthas and diviras are mentioned separately and in VIII. 2383 it is stated that the brāhmana Sivaratha, who was a roguish kayastha, was strangulated in the reign of Jayasimha. So in the 12th century kayasthas were only officers in Cashmir and brāhmaṇas held such offices. Vide Rājatarangini V, 180-184 for a bitter diatribe against kāyasthas.</p>
<p>The Śūdrakamalakara (pp. 279-280) speaks of three sub castes of kāyasthas.</p>
<p>Kārāvara. According to Manu X. 36 he is a doubly mixed oaste sprung from the union of a niṣāda with a vaidehi and his oraft is that of a carmakāra. According to later digests like the Śūdrakamalakara he is called &lsquo;kabāra&rsquo; or &lsquo;bhoi&rsquo; and holds torches and carries umbrellas for others.</p>
<p>Kāruṣa. According to Manu X. 23 this caste springs from the union of a vrātys vaisya and a similar female. This caste is also called Sudhanvācārya, Vijanman, Maitra and Satvata (according to Manu ).</p>
<p>Kirāta. Vide above (p. 44) for vedio references. Veda-Vyāsa speaks of him as a subdivision of sūdra ( note 184). According to Manu ( X. 43-44) he is a kṣatriya reduced to the status of a sudra. Anuśāsana (35.17-18 ) says the same about Mekalas, Dravidas, Latas, Pauparas, Yavanas and others. Karnaparva 73. 20 speaks of kirātas as men of fiery valour. Asvamedhika 73. 25 shows that Arjuna met kirātas, yavanas and Mleochas when proceeding to the north with the Aśramedha horse. The Amarakoha says that kirāta, dabara and pulinda are subdivi sions of Mlecoba castes,</p>

<p>History of Dharmaśāstra</p>
<p>( Ch. II</p>
<p>Kukkuta. According to Baud. Dh. 8. I. 8. 8 he is a pratiloma oaste, but I. 9. 15 says that he is the child of the union of a sūdra with a niṣada woman, while I. 8. 12 states that he is the offspring of a vaisya from a niṣada woman. 188 Manu X. 18 agrees with Baud. Db. I. 9. 15. According to Kaut. III. 7 he is the offspring of an ugra male from a niṣāda female. According to Adityapurāṇa quoted in the Sūdrakamalakara he manufactures swords and other weapons and engages in cookfights for the king.</p>
<p>Kunda. According to Manu III. 174 he is the offspring of a clandestine intercourse between a married brāhmaṇa woman whose husband is living and a brābmaṇa male.</p>
<p>Kukunda. According to the Sūtasarhitā he is the offspring of a māgadha from a sūdra female.</p>
<p>Kumbhakara. This word ocours in the gapa kulaladi (Pān. IV. 3. 118 ). Ubanas ( 32-33 ) says that he is the offspring of the clandestine union of a brāhmaṇa with a vaibya female. Vaik. (X 12 ) agrees with Ubanag and adds that the offspring becomes either a kumbhakāra or a barber who sbaves parts of the body above the navel. Veda-Vyāsa (I. 10-11 ) and Devala (quoted in Par. M. II. 1. p. 431 and Gr. R. p. 337 ) include the potter among sudras.187 In the Central Provinces the Kumbhāra is a scheduled oaste.</p>
<p>Kulala. For Vedic references see above (p.43). Paṇ IV3.118 explains the formation of kaulalakam (made by a potter ). The Aśv. Gr. IV. 3. 18 says that all earthen Vessels (kaulālam) of a deceased agnihotrin should be kept by his son. Why two names arose for the caste of potters it is difficult to explain.</p>
<p>Kulika. This caste is mentioned in Saṅkha quoted by Aparārka p. 1175 (where Apararka explains it as devalaka ).</p>
<p>Kusilava. According to Baudhāyana as quoted in the Kṛtyakalpataru he is the offspring of an ambastha from a vaidebaka female. According to Amara he is the same as a carana ( a bard). According to Kaut. (III. 7 ) he is the offspring of a vaidehaka male from an ambaṣtha female ( i. e. exactly the reverse of Baudhayana&rsquo;s view ) and he gives the name vaiṇa to the offspring of an ambaṣtha male from a vaidebaka female.</p>

<p>Kṛta. According to Gaut. IV. 15 he is the offspring of a vaibya from a brāhmaṇa woman. Yaj. I. 93 and others call this caste vaidehaka.</p>
<p>Kaivarta. In the Assam valley kaibartta is &amp; soheduled caste. Vide under antyaja (p. 70) above. Medhātithi on Manu X, 4 says that this is a mixed caste. Manu X. 34 tells us that the inhabitants of Aryāvarta employ the name kaivarta to denote the offspring of a niṣāda from an āyogava woman, who is also oalled mārgava and dāsa ( dāśa ?) and who subsists by plying boats. Samkara on Vedantasūtra IT. 3. 43 says that dāśa and kaivarta are the same. Fick p. 302 notes that fishermen who work with nets and baskets were called in the Jātakas kevatta.</p>
<p>Kolika. Mentioned as one of the antyajeg by Veda-Vyāga. Vide note 173 under antyaja. Koli is a scheduled caste in the Central Provinces and Kol in United Provinces.</p>
<p>Ksats. For vedio references see above. According to Baud. Dh. 8. I. 9.7, Kaut. (IIL 7), Manu X. 12, 13 and 16, Yāj. I. 94, Nārada ( stripumsa 112 ), this is a pratiloma caste sprung from a sūdra father and kṣatriya mother. Manu (X. 49-50) pres oribes for him the same avocation as for ugra and pulkasa. Vas. Dh. S. 18. % oalls him vaiṇa. In the Amarakoga ksatr is given three meanings, a charioteer, doorkeeper and the caste described above. In Chāndogya Up. IV. 1, 5, 7, 8 the word seems to mean only door-keeper. Pān. notices the word (VI. 4.11). The Sahyadrikhanda ( 26. 63-66 ) says that kṣatç is also called niṣada and that he is an expert in catching deer by means of nets, is a forester and kills wild animals, also rings &amp; bell at night to remind people of the hour.</p>
<p>Khanaka. Aocording to Vaik. (X. 15 ) he is the offspring of an dyogava male and kṣatriya female and lives by digging.</p>
<p>Khasa or khaba, According to Manu X. 22 this is another name for karapa; while in X. 43-44 he makes the khagas a kṣatriya caste originally but reduced to the status of sūdras by the absence of samskāras and the absence of contact with brahmanas. Vide Sabha. 52. 3, Udyoga 160. 103.</p>
<p>Guhaka. According to the Sātasamhita he is the offspring of a syapaca from a brahmana female.</p>
<p>Goja ( or Goda ). According to Uśanas ( 28-29 ) he is the offspring of a clandestine union between a kṣatriys male and female.</p>

<p>[ Ch. II</p>
<p>Gopa. Vide note 184. He is the modern Gavli and a kūdrs subcasto. Yaj. II. 48 says that debts contracted by gopa wives must be paid by their husbands as the latter&rsquo;s profession and earnings depend upon them. The Kāmagūtra (1. 5. 37 ) mentions a caste oalled Gopalaka.</p>
<p>Golaka. He is the offspring of a clandestine intercourse between a brāhmana widow and a brābmapa male. Vide Manu III. 174, Lagbu-Satātapa 105, Sūtasamhita ( Siva. 12. 12 ).</p>
<p>Cakri, According to Uśanas (22-23 ) he is the offspring of a clandestine union between &amp; sodra male and a vaibya fomalo and subsists by (selling) oil and oiloakes or salt. He seems to be the same as tailika. Hārita ( quoted by A parārka p. 279 ) mentions him. Acoording to Brabınapurāṇa quoted by Apararka p. 1177 he is one who prosses sesame. According to Vaik. (X. 13) he is the offspring of a secret love affair between &amp; vaisya male and a brāhmaṇa female and engages in the sale of salt and oil.</p>
<p>Carmakāra. Vide under antyaja (p. 70) above. He is men tioned in many smṛtis like Viṣnu Dh. S. (51.8 ), Āpastamba ( in verse 9.32), Parāśara (VI. 44). According to Usanas (4), he is the offspring of a sūdra from a ksatriya girl, while verse 21 says that those sprung from a vaidehaka and a brāhmaṇa girl subsist by working on hides. Vaik. (X. 15 ) agrees with this latter. Manu IV. 218 speaks of him as carmāvakartin ( outter of hides). According to several smrtis he is one of the Beven antyajas. According to the Sūtasamhitā he is the offspring of an dyogave from a brāhmana female. This name persists to this day as cambhār (in Western India ) or cāmār in all other Indian provinces. This caste is often spoken of as Mochi (shoe-maker ). Often the moohis are Moslems. This is an untouchable caste and the population of carmakāras in India is very large, In the Bombay Presidency alone they are about two hundred and ninety thousand ( in 1931 ).</p>
<p>Cakrika. According to Amara he is a person who rings a bell. Kṣirasyāmi says that he announces the king&rsquo;s arrival by ringing bells and that some regard him as the same as vaitalika. According to Saṅkha ( prose ) and Sumantu quoted by Aparārka (pp. 1175–76) cakrika and tailika are separate suboastes. According to Vaik. (X. 14 ) he is the offspring of a love affair between a gūdra male and a vaisya female and his avocation is the sale of salt, oil and oil cakes.</p>

<p>Varna: cāndala</p>
<p>81</p>
<p>Candāla (or cāndāla). For Vedio references see above pp. 44-45. Aco. to Gaut. IV. 15-16, Vas. Dh. S. 18.1, Baud. Dh. S. I. 9.7, Manu X. 12, Yāj. I. 93, Anuśāsana 48. 11 he is a pratiloma caste sprung of a śūdra from&rsquo;a brāhmaṇa woman. He is the lowest among men ( Manu X. 12 ), beyond the pale of religious observances prescribed for the four varnas ( sarvadharma-babi ṣkṛta, as Yāj. I. 93 says ) and often spoken of in the same breath with dogs and crows (e. g. Āp. Dh. S. II. 4. 9.5, Gaut. 15. 25, Yāj. I. 103 ).188 The word occurs in the kulālādi gana ( Pāṇ. IV. 3. 118). Veda-Vyāsa-smrti ( I. 9-10) says that there are three kinds of cāndalas. viz. the offspring of a sūdra from a brāhmana woman, the offspring of an unmarried woman, the offspring of a union with a sagotra girl. Yama quoted in Par. M. vol. II. part 1 p. 306 says that one born of a person who after becoming an ascetio turns back to the householder&rsquo;s life, one born of a sagotra woman and one who is the offspring of a sūdra from a brāhmaṇa woman are all cāṇdālas. Laghu-sātātapa ( 59 ) has &amp; similar verse. Manu (X.51-56) says that cāṇdālas and syapacas should have their houses outside the village, vessels used by them cannot be used by others (even after putting them in fire ), their wealth consists of dogs and asses, their clothes should be the garments on corpses, they should take their food in broken Vessels, their ornaments were to be made of iron, they should incessantly roam, they are not to enter towns and villages at night, they have to carry the corpses of persons who have no relatives, they are to be hangmen when the king so orders, they may take the clothes, ornaments and beds of persons that are to be hanged. Uśanas (9-10) says that their ornaments are to be of lead or iron, they should have a leather thong round their neoks or oymbal under their armpits, they should remove the dirt of the village in the first part of the day. According to Viṣnu Dh. S. 16.11 and 14 their avocation is to be hangmen or to kill those offenders who are condemned to death and cāṇdālas have to stay outside the village and to wear the clothes on corpses. Santi 141.29-32 gives a grapbio description of their hamlet. The classical description of a oāṇdāla hamlet is in the Kadambari of Bāna. In Anuśāsana (29.17 ) Matanga is called &amp; cāndāla because he was born of a brāhmana woman from a barber,</p>

<p>town or market place by striking a piece of wood to make themselves known so that a man may avoid them and not come in contact with them (vide &lsquo;Record of Buddhist kingdoms&rsquo; tr. by Legge, p. 43). In modern times cāṇdālas are returned as &amp; scheduled oaste in Madras and Orissa.</p>
<p>Cina. According to Manu X. 43-44 the Cinas were a ksatriya caste reduced to the status of sūdras. They are frequently named in the Mahabhārata e. g. Sabhā 51. 23, Vanaparva 177. 1, Udyoga 19. 15.</p>
<p>Cuñicu. According to Manu X. 48 the avocation of Meda, Andhra, Cuñcu and Madgu is to kill forest (or wild) animals, Kullūka says that he is the offspring of a brāhmaṇa from a vaidehska woman,</p>
<p>Cucuka. According to Vaik. (X. 13) he is the offspring of the marriage of &amp; vaiśya with a sūdra woman and his a vocation is the sale and purchase of betelnut, betelnut leaves and sugar.</p>
<p>Cailanirnejaka (or only nirnejaka)-washerman. This occurs in Viṣnu Dh, S. 51. 15 and Manu IV. 216. It appears that Viṣnu who separately mentions &ldquo;rajaka&rsquo; (in 51. 13 ) distingui. shes between the two, Harita ( quoted in Aparārka p. 279 ) also distinguishes between &lsquo;rajaka&rsquo; (one who dyes clothes ) from</p>
<p>nirṇejaka' (one who washes clothes ). Very often &lsquo;rajaka&rsquo; means only &lsquo;a washerman&rsquo;(as Amara says ).</p>
<p>Jalopajivin (subsisting by catching animals in a net) probably the same as &amp; kaivarta. He is mentioned in Harita quoted by Aparārka p. 279.</p>
<p>Jhalla. Manu X. 22 says that it is another name for Karana and Khasa. In Bengal Jhalo Malo or Malo is returned as a scheduled caste.</p>
<p>Domba (or Doma) is the same as śvapaca according to Kṣira syāmi on Amara. Parāśara quoted by Aparārka (p. 1197) puts $yapāka, domba and cāṇdāla on the same level. In the Rājatar angini ( V.354, VI. 182, VI. 192 ) dombas are spoken of as untou chables on the same level with cāṇdalas and as following the profession of singers. In Rājatarangini V. 389-394 dombas are spoken of as svapacas. This caste is returned as a scheduled caste in Madras as Dombo, as Dom in Bengal, Bihar and U. P.</p>
<p>Takṣan or Takṣaka (Carpenter). For vedic references see above (p. 43). He is the same as vardhaki quoted above, under kāyastha. He is mentioned by Manu IV. 210, Viṣnu Dh. 8.51. 8. According to the Mahabhāṣya on Pān. II. 4. 10</p>
<p>Ch. II)</p>
<p>Varna : takṣan</p>
<p>the takṣan is a sūdra and on the same level with an ayas kāra (ironsmith) and excluded from sacrificial rites. Even 80 early as the Sat. Br. the takṣan was an unboly person ( amedhya ) and his touch made yajñapātras impure ( I. 1.3. 12). Uśanas 43 says that takṣaka is the offspring of a brāhmaṇa female from a sūcaka ( i. e. he is a pratiloma). He must be supposed to be originally different from the rathakāra (vide Tai. S. quoted above p. 43 ) who was allowed the vedic rite of adhūna or probably in the time of the smṛtis the carpenter lost his former status. According to Vaik. (X. 14 )189 the offspring of a brāhmaṇa girl from &amp; cucuka ( sūcaka?) is a takṣaka who is untouchable or a goldsmith or blacksmith or worker in bell-metal. Bṛhaspati names the takṣaka as one whose food a brāhmaṇa could not eat.</p>
<p>Tantuvāya ( a weaver), also called kuyinda. He is men tioned in Visnu Dh, S. (51. 13) and Saṅkha quoted by Aparārka p. 1175. He is regarded as &amp; śūdra by the Mahābhāsya on Pāṇ, II. 4. 10 and as excluded from sacrificial rites.</p>

<p>Tūmropajivin (coppersmith). According to Uśanas (14) he is the offspring of an āyogava from a brāhmaṇa woman. Vaik. (X. 15 ) says the same and calls him tāmra. The Jātiviveka (D. O. No. 347 of 1887-91 ) gives the name as tāmra-kuttaka.</p>
<p>Tunnavaya (a tailor). He occurs in Manu IV. 214. Acoording to the Brahmapurāna quoted by Aparārka p. 1178 ho is the same as sūci (or saucika ).</p>

<p>Daśa (a fisherman). This occurs in an Upaniṣad passage according to Vedānta sūtra II. 3. 43. Veda-Vyāsa (I. 12-13) includes him among antyajas (vide footnote 173). Manu X. 34 says that mārgava, dāga ( dāśa ?) and kaivarta are the same and that he subsists by plying boats. Pāṇ. (III. 4. 73 ) derives the word. Vide under kaivarta.</p>

<p>Dauṣmanta. According to Gaut. 4. 14 this is an anuloma caste sprung from the union of a kṣatriya male and a sūdra female. According to the Sūtasambitā the name is Dauṣyanta.</p>
<p>Dravida. The same as karana, according to Manu X. 22. According to Manu X. 43-44, this is &amp; kṣatriya caste reduced to the status of a śūdra. Vide under khaśa, and Mahābhārata, Udyoga 160. 103, Droṇa 93, 43.</p>
<p>Dhigvana. According to Manu X. 15 he is the offspring of a brāhmaṇa male from an āyogava female and according to Manu X 49 he subsists by working on (and sale of ) hides. Kullūka on Manu X. 49 quotes a text of Uśanas that Dhige vanas subsist by working on bides and selling them and distin guishes them from kārāvaras. This passage is not found in the printed text of Uśanas. In the Jātiviveka he is styled Mocikāra.</p>
<p>Dhivara. Same as kaivarts and dāśa, Gaut. (IV. 17 ) indioates that this is a pratiloma caste sprung from a vaisya male and a kṣatriya female ( according to the view of some teachers ). In the Tai. Br. III. 4. 12 Dhaivara, Dāśa and Kaivarta are separately mentioned, but how they were distinguished it is difficult to say. All caught fish in different ways. Dhimar is a scheduled caste in the Bhandara District of C.P.</p>
<p>Dhvaji (seller of wines mentioned by Sumantu and Harita quoted by Aparārka p. 1176. The Brahmapurāṇa quoted by Aparārka (p. 1177 ) says he is the same as saundika.</p>
<p>Nata. He is one of the seven antyajas ( vide note 170 above). Nata is a scheduled caste in Bengal, Bihar, U, P, and Punjab. Hārita quoted by Aparārka (p. 279 ) distinguishes between nata and sailūṣa and Aparārka remarks that nata is &amp; specifio oaste, while sailūṣa is one who though not &amp; nata by caste makes a living by going on the stage. Manu X. 22 says that he is the same as karaṇa, khasa (vide note on kbasa p. 79). Pāṇini knew of a Natasūtra composed by Silalin and another by Krśāśva (IV. 3. 110 and 111), but whether the naṭas he meant were so by caste or whether he meant only actors in general is not clear. Vide under rangāvatārin for a quotation from Maitri Up. Probably this oaste is the same as the Kolhātis or Bahu. rūpis of modern times ( in the Decoan) who are dancers, acrobats and jugglers by profession. Fick&rsquo;s work p. 299 speaks</p>

<p>Varna : nata</p>
<p>of natakakulas mentioned in Buddhist Jātakas and at p. 294 he shows that in the Suruci Jātaka the nata is described as throw ing up a ball of rope and climbing it and performing other trioks of jugglery.</p>
<p>Nartaka. According to Uśanas (19) he is the offspring of a rañjaka from a vaiśya woman and his profession is that of a singer. Bșhaspati quoted in Par. M. (II. part I p. 380) sepa rately mentions in the same verse nata and nartaka (both being abhojyānna to a brāhmaṇa). Atri VII. 2 also mentions the two separately. See note 189.</p>
<p>Nāpita (barber). The Sāṅkhāyana gphya I. 25 refers to him (in cūļākarma). Uśanas (32-34) and Vaik. (X. 12) say that he is the offspring of a clandestine affair between a brāhmaṇa male and a vaisya female and Uśanas derives the word by saying that he shaves the body above the navel of &amp; person. 190 Vaik. ( X. 15 ) says that the offspring of an ambastha malo from a kṣatriya female is a nāpita, but he shaves the hair on the body below the navel. Parāśara (XI. 21 ) 101 says that the offspring of &amp; brāhmaṇs from &amp; śūdra girl is called dāsa if samskāras are performed on him, but if they are not performed he be. comes &amp; napita. Pān. (VI. 2. 62 ) specially provides for the accentuation of words meaning artisan ( silpin, like hāpita or kulāls) when compounded with the word grāma. The Sūtasan hitā (Siva-chap. XII. 15) says that the offspring of the olandestine union of a brāhmaṇa male and a. vaisya female is called kumbhakāra or ūrdhva.Dāpita, while verse 32 says that the offspring of a kṣatriya female from a niṣāda is called *adho-nāpita',</p>
<p>Nicchivi. Manu X. 22 says that this is another name for karang or khaśa. Probably this is a misreading for Licchavi or Licchivi. Kaut. (Artbaśāstra XI. 1) speaks of the oligarcbies or corporations of Licohivika, Vṛjika, Mallaka &lsquo;9% etc. Vaigāli was the seat of this oligarchy in the 6th century B. C. (Rapson&rsquo;s &lsquo;Anoient India&rsquo; p. 169 ). Vide Indian Antiquary vol. 32 p. 233 for their Tibetan affinities and I.

<p>Quarterly,&rsquo; 1933, vol. 18 p. 439 ff. Fa Hion ( in &lsquo;Records of Buddhist Kingdoms&rsquo; translated by Legge, 1886, p. 71 ) says that the Liochavis of Vaiśāli were attached to Buddha and also speaks of Ananda ( pupil of Buddha) and the Licchavis.</p>
<p>Niāṣda. For vedio references see above (pp. 43 and 46 ). The Nirukta193 III. 8 wbile explaining the words &lsquo;pañcajanā mama hotram juṣadhvam&rsquo;in Rg. X. 53. 4 remarks that according to Aupamanyava the &lsquo;five people&rsquo; are the four varnas with niṣāda as the fifth. This shows that Aupamanyava regarded them as distinct from the four varnas (inoluding the sūdras). The Nirukta further says that according to the Nairuktas the niṣāda is so called because &lsquo;sin (or evil) sits down in him&rsquo;; from this it follows that in the times of Yaska the niṣādas had come to be looked down upon with scorn as evil people and were probably some aborigines like the modern Bhils. Accord ing to Baud, Dh. S. (I. 9.3 and II. 2.33), Vas. 18.8, Manu X. 8, Anuśāsang 48.5, Yāj. I. 91 the Niṣāda is an anuloma caste, offspring of the marriage of a brāhmaṇa with a sūdra woman. Baud. Dh. 8. (II. 2.34), Kuut. (III. 7), Manu ( X, 8) and Yāj. ( I. 91 ) say that pāraśava is another name for niṣāda. Manu ( IX, 178 ) derives pāraśava from the root pūray ( to go across ) and the word $ava ( a corpse) meaning though living he is like one dead&rsquo;. In a corrupt passage of Vas. Dh. S.194 ( 18. 9-10) the same derivation is accepted. Gaut. (IV. 14 ) distinguishes between niṣāda and pāraśava, the former (aco. to the com. Haradatta ) being the offspring of a brāhmaṇg froin a vaisya woman and the latter being the offspring of a brāhmaṇa male and a sūdra female. According to Nārada (stripumsa v. 108 ) and Anuśāsana 48.1%, niṣāda is the offspring of a kṣatriya male and a śūdra female and he subsists by fishing (acoording to the latter). Nārada ( stripunsa 108 ) says that pāraśava is the offspring of a brāhmaṇa male and a sūdra female. Uśanas ( 36-38 ) says that the offspring of the marriage of &amp; brāhmanx with &amp; sūdra woman is called pārasava and gains his livelihood as the worshipper of the goddess Bhadrakāli or by learning Saiva agamas or by playing on musical instruments, while niṣāda is the illegitimate offspring of a brāhmaṇa from a sūdra woman who subsists by killing wild beasts (such as elephants ) and by</p>

<p>selling flesh. The Vaik. 195 (X. 13 ) has practically the same remarks to make about pāraśava and niṣāda. Sāntiparva ( 59. 96-97) speaks of niṣādas as men with reddish eyes and with black hair. In the Rāmāyana Guha, the king of niṣādas, helps Rāma to cross the river Ganges ( Ayodhyā 50. 33). Here he is spoken of as belonging to the caste of niṣādas ( niśādajātyah). We have historical evidence for the name pāraśava in the Harsacarita (I, towards end ), where Bānaisi tells us that he had with him two pāraśava brothers Candrasena and Mātrṣena in his travels. In the Tipperah copperplate of a chieftain called Lokanātha (about 650 A. D.) we are told that the king&rsquo;s maternal grandfather Keśava was a pāraśava (vide E. I. vol. 15 at p. 307). The Mit. on Yāj. I. 91 cautions that this niṣāda ( the anuloma offspring of a brāhmaṇa from a sūdra woman) is different from another caste called niṣāda, which is a pratiloma one and lives by catohing fish, Medhātithi on Manu X, 8 does the same. Nisāda occurs in the gana kulālādi (Pan. IV. 3. 118 ). The Vāyupurāna ( vol. II. chap, 1.120-121) narrates that the nisādas, dark and dwarfish, were produced from the left hand of king Vena and they dwelt on the Vindhya. In the Bhāgavata-purāna we have the same story 1 (IV. 14. 42 ff.) and we are told that niṣādas were dark like crows, of short stature, snubnosed, with red eyes and hair and that they dwelt in mountains and forests.</p>
<p>Pahlava.&ndash;occurs in Manu ( X. 43-44) as a ksatriya caste reduced to the status of sūdra. Vide note on khasa. The Mahābhārate geveral times mentions the Pahlavas, Pāradas and other non-Aryan people (vide Sabhā 32. 16-17, Udyoga 4. 15, Bhiṣma 20. 13).</p>
<p>Pāndusopūka. According to Manu X. 37 he is the offspring of a cāṇdala male from a vaidehaka woman, who maintains him self by dealing in bamboos. He is the same as buruda.</p>

<p>Pāraśava. Vide niṣāda above. In the Adiparva 109, 25 Vidura is called pāraśava and he is said (in Adi. 114.12 ) to have married the pārasavi daughter of king Devaka. The Sahyadri. khanda ( 26. 43) says that he is called śūdra and is superior to a sūdra ( in status ) and that he was to live by the avocations pre acribed for sūdras.</p>
<p>Pingala. According to the Sūtasarhitā he is the offspring of a brāhmana from an āyogaya female.</p>
<p>Pundra or Paundraka. Frequently mentioned in the Maha bhārata among non-Aryan tribes e. g. Drona 93. 44, Āśvame dhika 29. 15-16. Medhātitbi on Manu X, 44 remarks that the Paundrakas aro spoken of as ksatriyas in the Mahābhārata, 80 a man may be misled into thinking that even in the days of Medbātithi they were still kṣatriyas ( but they were not so ).</p>
<p>Pulinda. For vedic references see above (p. 47). They were &amp; wild mountain tribe like the Kirātas or Śabaras. In the Vana parva 140. 25 Pulindas, Kirātas and Tanganas are spoken of as dwelling on the Himālaya. Udyoga 160. 103, Karna 73. 19-20, Anuśāsana 33. 21-22 mention pulindas. Uśanas (16) says that he is the illegitimate offepring of a vaisya male fron a kṣatriya female and he lives by rearing cattle and by killing wild beasts. Vaik. ( X, 14 ) says the same and adds that he subsists on the produce of the forest and by killing wild animals. The Sūtasambitā is of the same opinion as Vaik.</p>
<p>Pulkasa ( or paulkasa). The word is also written as pukkase. Samkarācārya on Bṛhadāranyaka Up. IV. 3. 22 days that pulkasa and paulkasa are the same. Acoording to Baud. Dh. 8. (1.9.14) and Manu X. 18 he is the offspring of a niṣāda male from a sūdra female. According to Kaut. (III. 7) be is the offspring of a niṣāda male from an ugra female, while Vaik. X. 14, Uśapas (17) and the Sūtasaṁhitā say that he is the offspring of a sūdra male from a kṣatriya woman and that he makes his livelihood by manufacturing and selling 198 liquors or natural intoxicating sap. The same is the view of some teachers according to Gautama IV. 17. According to Vas. Dh, 8.. ( 18. 5 ) and Viṣnu Dh. S. (16.5) he is the offspring of a vaibya</p>

<p>male from a ksatriya female and the latter adds that he subsists by bunting. The Agnipurāṇa (151. 15 ) says that pukkases are hunters. Yama&rdquo;&rdquo; and Hārita quoted in the Kștya kalpataru make him out as the offspring of a śūdra male from a vaisya female. Manu X. 49 prescribes catching and killing animals that live in holes as the occupation of kṣats, ugra and pukkasa. Kṣirasyāmi ( com. of Amara ) says that pukkasa is the same as mrtapa (which see below). Āp. Dh. 8. (II. 1. %. 6) says tbat when a Brahmana, Ksatriya or Vaiśya is guilty of the theft of gold, of the murder of a brāhmaṇa, they undergo for some time in hell torments and then are respectively born as Cāṇdāla, Paulkasa or Vaiṇa.</p>
<p>Puṣkara. Mentioned in Veda-Vyāna-smrti (I. 12 ) as one of the antyajas. Vide note 173 above.</p>

<p>Barbara. Medbātithi on Manu X. 4 says that the barbaras are samkirṇayonis. In the Mahābhārata they are frequently mentioned among non-Aryan tribes along with Saka, Sabara, Yavana, Pahlava etc. Vide Sabha, 32. 16-17, 51. 23; Vana 254, 18 ( as staying in the west); Droṇa 121. 13; Anuśāsans 35. 17; Śānti 65. 13.</p>

<p>Bhoja. Acoording to the Sūta-sambitā he is the offspring of &amp; kṣatriya woman and &amp; vaisya male.</p>
<p>Madgu. Mentioned in Manu X. 48 as subsisting by killing wild beasts. Kullūka on that verse explains that according to Baudhāyana he is the offspring of a brāhmaṇa from a bandin female. Vaik. X. 12 says that he is the offspring of the marriage of a kṣatriya male with a vaiśya female and subsists as &amp; merchant ( sreṣtbin ) and does not take to the profession of &amp; Wartior.</p>

According to Uśanas ( 39-40 ) he is the offspring of a clandestine union between a kṣatriya male and a vaisya female and he gains bis livelihood by working on beads, by perforating pearls and dealing in coral and conches. According to the Sūtasaṁhitā he is the clandestine offspring of a vaisya male from &amp; vaibya female.</p>

Sahyā. drikhanda ( 26. 60-62 ) also calls him bandin and says he is slightly superior to śūdra and that he is clever in ornate prose, in six languages, in kalās and he is a devotee of Kālikā. Vaik. (X. 13 ) states that even sūdras cannot take food cooked by him, that he is an untouchable and maintains himself by praise, by singing or by being a messenger. Ubanas (7-8) says that he becomes the bandin of brāhmaṇas and kṣatriyas, he maintains himself by lauding (the deeds of others ) or 88 &amp; messenger or servant of a vaisya. Pāṇini IV. 1. 70 derives the word Magadha from the country Magadha, but apparently not</p>

<p>Matanga. The same as cāndāla. The Kādambari of Bana (para 9) and Amara employ them as synonymous. Yama (12) uses the word Matanga where we ordinarily find cāṇāla in other smrtis. In the Bombay Presidency there is an untouchable caste called Māng which numbers about three hundred thousand,</p>

<p>Māhiṣya. According to the view of some teachers mentioned in Gaut. IV.17 and Yāj. I. 92 he is an anuloma oaste sprung from the marriage of a kṣatriya with a vaibya woman. According to the Sabyādrikhanda ( 26. 45–46 ) he is entitled to upanayana and his evocations are astrology, augury, prognostioations due to svara. According to the Sūtasamhitā he is the same as ambaṣtha.</p>
<p>Mūrdhāvasikta. This is an anuloma caste according to the view of some teachers in Gaut. IV. 17 and Yāj. I. 91 sprung from the marriage of a brāhmaṇa with a ksatriya woman. According to Vaik. (X.12) the offspring of the marriage of a brāhmaṇa with a ksatriya woman is the foremost among anulomas and is called savarna, while the offspring of the clandestine union of these two is oalled abhiṣikta. If crowned he becomes a king, otherwise he subsists by studying Ayurveda (Medioine ) or the science of ghosts or astronomy, astrology and mathematics.

<p>Mṛtapa. Vide pulkasa above. In the Mahābbāsya' on Pāṇ. II. 4. 10 this caste is mentioned as separate from candāla, but both are included by the Mahābhāṣya under śūdras that are niravasila (i, e. those who are so low in the caste system that if &amp; vessel is used by them for eating their food from it cannot be used by any one of the other castes even after the vessel is purified by fire &amp;o.).</p>
<p>Meda. He is one of the seven antyajas ( vide note 170 ). This is mentioned in Nārada (vākpāruṣya, verse 11). Anuśāsana 22. 22 speaks of medas, pulkagas and antā vesāyins, and the com. Nilakantha 201 explains that Medas are those who eat the flesh of dead cattle. Manu X, 36 says that he is the offspring of a vaidebaka male and a nigāde woman, that he dwells out side the village and Manu X. 48 says that his business along with that of Andhra, Cuñou and Madgu is to kill wild beasts. Vide under Andhra above and see E. I. vol. XX. p. 130 where meds and capdāla are named as lowest castes in a grant of Paramardideva in samvat 1236.

From Striparva 22. 11 it appears that Jayadratha ( king of the countries of Sindhu and Sauvira) had Kamboja and Yavana women in his harem. Pāṇini (IV. 1.59 ) derives the word Yavanāni from Yavana and a vārtika on that sūtra adds that Yavanāni means the lipi ( the written alphabet) of the Yavanas. Patañjali in his Mahābbāsya (on Pān. II. 4. 10) indicates that he was prepared to regard Yavanas and Sakas as sūdras but as outside Arya. varta. Asoka in Rock Ediots V and XIII refers to the Yonas and Kambojas as nations on the borders of his empire. The Viṣnupurāṇa IV. 3.. 21 describes that the Yavanas shaved the head and also the beard, the Sakas tonsured their heads only, the Pāradas allowed the hair on the head to grow long and the Pahlavas grow beards and that all became Mlecohas because they gave up their original dharmas and because brāhmaṇas also left them.</p>
<p>Rangāvatārin (or-tūraka ). According to Manu IV, 215 be is distinot from sailūṣa and gāyana. Saṅkha (quoted by Aparārka p. 1175 ), Saṅkha ( 17, 36 ) and Viṣnu Dh. S. 51. 14 mention him. According to Brahmapurāṇa (quoted by Aparārka p. 1178 ) be is a nata who goes on the stage for livelihood and who introduces various changes in his appearance and dress. Rangāvatārin is mentioned in the Maitri Up. along with nata and bhata.208</p>
<p>Rajaka (washerman), Dhobi is &amp; scheduled caste in U. P., Bihar and C. P. and in Bengal (called Dhoba). He is one of the antyajas according to several writers ( vide note 170 above). Acoording to Vaikh. (X. 15) and the Sūtasambitā he is the offspring of a pulkaga ( or vaideba ) from a brāhmans woman, while according to Uśanas (18) he is the offspring of a pulkasa male from a vaisya girl. The Mahābhāsya on Pān. (II. 4, 10 ) includes him under sūdra. Yāj. II. 48 mentions him as liable to pay his wife&rsquo;s debts, because his livelihood depends on her, The Sūdrakamalakara mentioned another caste of rajaka ( which is the offspring of an ugra male and vaidehaks female ).</p>

<p>Rathakāra. Vide above pp. 43, 45 for Vedio references. According to Baud. gr. II. 5. 6 and Bharadvāja gr. (I) his upanayana was to be performed in the rainy season. It appears he lost his status gradually. In the Baud. Dh.S.( I. 9. 6) he is the offspring of the marriage of a vaiśya male with a sūdra female. According to Yaj. I. 95 he is an anuloma doubly mixed as he is the offspring of a mahiṣya male from a karang female and according to a prose passage of Saṅkha quoted by the Mit. the rathakāra is entitled to have upanavana performed, to offer sacrifices and gifts and makes his living by learning the art of taming horses, of making chariots and building houses. According to Usanas (5-6) and Vaik. (X. 13 ) he is the offspring of a clandestine union between &amp; kṣatriya male and a brāhmana woman and he is to behave like a sūdra, he is not a twice-born (dvija ) and cannot repeat Vedic mantras and makes his living by tending and driving horses and carts,</p>
<p>Rāmaka. According to Vas. Dh. S. 18. 4 he is a pratiloma sprung from the union of a vaiśya male and a brābmana female. This would be kita, according to Gaut. (IV. 15), vaidehaka according to Baudhāyana.</p>

(III. 7) makes the vaiṇa the offspring of an ambastba male from a vaidehaka female; and according to Manu X. 49 he makes his livelihood by beating musical instruments. Kullūka on Manu IV, 215 says that Vena is one who maintains himself by splitting bamboos and that he is the same as buruda according to Visvarūpa.. For Vaiṇa see Āp. Dh. S. quoted under pulkasa (p. 89). Kaut. (IIL. 7) adds that a vainya follows the same profession as &amp; rathakāra Śankba ( 17. 38), Viṣnu Dh. S. 51. 14, Yāj. III. 207 place the vena alongside of carmakāra, niṣāda and pulkasa. According to Vas. Dh. 8. (18,2) he is a pratiloma sprung from the union of a sūdra male and a kṣatriya female. Yāj. I. 161 has the form vaiṇa which the Mit. explains as meaning one who maintains himself by cutting and splitting bamboos. The sūdrakamalakara notes that according to Adipurāṇa vena is &amp; drum-beater to announce royal orders and edicts.</p>

According to Manu X. 47 and Agnipurāna (151. 14) his peculiar work is to attend on and guard women (in harems sto), while according to Usanas ( 20-21 ) and Vaik. (X. 14 ) he is to tend goats, cows and buffaloes and to sell milk, curds, buttor-milk and ghee. The Sūta-gamhitā says that vaideha and pulkasa are the same.</p>

But in other works like Baud. Dh. 8. (I. 9. 15), the word yrātya is applied to all who are born of the mixture of varnas.</p>
<p>Saka. Manu ( X. 43-44 ) mentions Sakas along with Yava nas and others as originally kṣatriyas reduced to the state of śūdras. Vide note on Yavana (p. 92) above. They are mentioned in the Mahābhārata along with Yayana and other non-Aryan tribes. Vido Sabhā 32. 16-17, 51. 23, Udyoga (4. 15; 19, 21; 160. 103 ), Blisma ( 20. 13 ), Droṇa ( 121. 13). Saka occurs in the kambojādigana ( Pāṇ. IV. 1. 175 ). Vide note 200.</p>

<p>Svapaca or Svapāka. He is one of the antyajas enumerated by Veda-Vyasa ( I. 12-13). Vide note 173 above. He occurs in the gana kulālādi ( Pān. IV.3. 118). According to Baud. Dh. 8. (1. 9, 12), Kaut. (III. 7), he is the offspring of an ugra malo from a female of the ksatr sub-caste, while according to Manu</p>
<p>X. 19 he is the offspring of a kṣatr male from an ugra female. Vaik. (X. 15 ) and Sūtasamhitā say that he is the offspring of a cāndāla male and a brāhmaṇa female, while Uśanas (11) holds that he is the offspring of a cīṇdāla male from a vaisya woman. According to Manu X. 51-56 cāṇdālas and svapacas follow the same avocation and are governed by the same rules ( vide p. 81 under cāṇdāla). Usanas (12) says that they eat the flesh of dogs and that dogs are their wealth, while Vaik. says that they wear the same marks that cāndālas have to wear (under the king&rsquo;s order, as Manu says in X 55 ), that they remove the filth of towns etc., stay near cemeteries, have to dis pose of corpses of men that leave no relatives, have to act as hangmen for offenders sentenced to death and to take their olothes eto., have to take food in broken pots and to eat dogs flesh and to deal in hides and armour (or in armour made of hides ). The Bhagavadgitā (5. 18 ) puts him on the same level with dogs. In the Mārkandeya-purāṇa (8. 81-83, 86, 96 ) a candāla is called svapāka ( i. e. no distinction is made between the two). In the Jātiviveka he is identified with the Mahar and with the Mang of the Deccan,</p>
<p>Satvata. According to Manu X. 23 he is the same as kāruṣa above.</p>
<p>Sudhanvācārya. According to Manu X. 23 he is the same as kāruṣa above.</p>
<p>Suvarna. Acoording to Usanas (vv. 24-25) he is the offspring of the legal union with Vedio mantras of &amp; brābmana male and a ksatriya female. It appears likely that the text is corrupt and we should read savarna for suvarna. He should perform rites prescribed by the Atharvaveda, he should by the king&rsquo;s order ride a horse, elephant or chariot, may act as the comman der of an army or may practise as a physioian.</p>

<p>Suvarnakāra or Sauvarṇika or Hemakāra (goldsmith). A hiranyakāra is mentioned in the Vāj. 8. XXX. 17 and in Tai. Br. III. 4. 14. According to Viṣṇu Dh. S. X. 4 and Nārada (inādāna 274 ) a goldsmith or a dealer in bronze or a bania was to examine the balance in the balance ordeal. Manu IV. 215, Yaj. I. 163, Saṅkha and Sumantu quoted by Aparārka (pp. 1175, 1176 ) treat him on &amp; level with karmakāra (blacksmith ) and niṣāda. Manu IX. 292 condemns him as the worst of all rogues (sarvakanṭakapāpistha ). For the view of Vaik. and Bphaspati vide under takṣan above (note 189). In the Maha bhārata it is said that after Paraśurāma&rsquo;s alleged extermination of the ksatriyas, some of them that escaped resorted to the castes of ironsmiths and goldsmiths.208</p>
<p>Sacaka. According to Uśanas ( v. 43 ) he is an anuloma born of the marriage of a vaiśya male from a sūdra female.</p>
<p>Sucika or sauciks or sūclone who works with a needle, a tailor. According to Vaik. (X. 15 ) and Usanas ( v. 22 ) he is a pratiloma, offspring of a vaidehaka from a ksatriya woman and engages in the work of sewing with a needle. Sauoika, according to the lexioon of Amara, is the same as tunnavāya (for which see above p. 83 ) and the Brahmapurāna quoted by Apar ārka (p. 1178 ) also equates sūcī with tunnavāya.</p>
<p>Suta. For vedic references see above p. 43. According to Gaut. (IV. 15), Baud. Dh. S. (1. 9. 9), Vas. (18.6), Kaut. (III. 7), Manu (X. 11), Nārada ( stripussa 110), Viṣnu Dh. S. (16.6), Yāj. (I. 93) and Sūtasamhita, he is a pratiloma sprung from a ksatriya male and a brāhmaṇa woman. Kauṭ is careful to add that the sūta who figures in the purānas as the reciter is quito different from this. A vārtika on Pāṇ. (VI. 3,70) teaches the formation of words like sūtaputri.208 According to Manu(X,47) and Viṣṇu the avocation of sūtas is driving a chariot ( i. e. breaking and yoking horses). According to Vaik. (X. 13) he makes his liveli hood by reminding the king of his duties and by cooking food for him, Usanas (v. 3) also says that his business is to remind (a king) of his duties.

<p>are the attendants of brāhmaṇas and kṣatriyas and the latter need not carry out what the sūta says. According to the Vāyupurāṇa (vo). I. 1. 33-38 and vol. II. 1. 139 ) the gūta was to preserve the pedigrees of kings and great men and traditions about learning or books, he is not authorised to study the Veda, the middling way of maintenance for him is to depend upon kings and to look after chariots, elephants and horses; an inferior way of maintenance is the practice of medicine. The Vaik. (X. 13) and the Sūta. samhitā expressly say that the difference between the sūta and the rathakāra consists in this that the former is the offspring of a marriage, while the latter is the offspring of &amp; clandestine union of a ksatriya male with a brāhmaṇa woman. The Sahyādrikhanda (26.53-54) says that he is inferior to ksatriyas, but is entitled to do all the work of a kṣatriya and that he also performs the work of a charioteer, of taming elephants and riding horses.</p>
<p>Sūnika or Saunilca (a butcher). Acoording to Usanas (v. 14) he is the offspring of an āyogava from a kṣatriya woman. Hārita ( quoted by Aparārka p. 279) speaks of him in the same breath with rajaka and carmakāra. The Brahmapurāna ( quoted by Aparārka p. 1177 ) says that he is &lsquo;paśumāraka&rsquo;. Sumantu207 quoted by Par. M, makes his food unfit for brāhmaṇas. He is the same as &lsquo;khātika&rsquo; according to the Jātiviveka.</p>
<p>Sairindhra. According to Manu X. 32 he is the offspring of a dasyu (as defined in Manu X. 45 ) from an ayogava woman and he makes his living by combing the hair (of men and women), he is not to be treated as a dāsa (i. e. he has not to eat ucobista food ), but is to perform menial work (such as sham pooing the body ) or is to subsist by catching deer etc. The word is included in the gaṇa kulālādi (Pān. IV, 3. 118 ). From the Mahābhārata we see what duties Draupadi disguised as sair andhri had to do for the queen of Virāṭa ( Virāṭa-parva 9. 18-19), viz.combing and arranging the hair, pounding unguents, making garlands. Similarly Damayanti became &amp; sairandhri to the mother of the Cedi king (Vanaparva 65. 68-70), but she refused to eat ucohista food, would not wash the feet of any. body and would not allow any man to approach her. According to Adipurāṇa quoted in Sūdrakamalakara he lives by hunting deer and guarding royal harems and women after delivery.</p>

<p>Sadūhanvana. Vide note on &lsquo;rathakāra&rsquo; above ( 45). Vide Kāmasūtra I. 5. 37.</p>
<p>It will have been noticed that some of the castes mentioned in the smrtis such as ambaṣtha, māgadha, malla and vaidehaka are connected with countries (Amba, Magadha, Videha etc.), that some others are based upon race such as Abhira, Kirāta and Saka. Manu ( X. 43-45 ) and the Mahābhārata ( Anuśāsana parva 33. 21-23 and 35. 17-18 ) were prepared to admit that several foreign races like the Sakas, Yavanas, Kambojas, Dravi das, Daradas, Sabaras, Kirātas etc. were originally ksatriyas, but had been reduced to the status of sūdras by losing contact with brāhmaṇas or by not liking the idea of being subject to the brabmanical system. The Viṣnupurāna (IV. 4. 47-48) says the game. Numerous names of castes arise from the professions they follow, o. g. ayaskāra, kumbhakāra, carmakāra, takṣan, tailika, nata, rathakāra, vena etc. Even in ancient times brāhmaṇas followed so many different occupations almost as in modern times that the list of brāhmaṇas who cannot be invited at śrāddhas because they follow occupations other than those prescribed for them is rather very formidable (vide Manu III. 151 ff. and the remarks on panktipāvana later on ).</p>
<p>It appears that comparatively very early many among the brahmanas had given up the occupations peculiar to them and were entitled to be called brāhmaṇas simply because of their birth. The Mahābhāṣya 208 of Patañjali quotes a verse &lsquo;tapas, vedio study, and birth ( from brāhmana parents ) these are the causes why a person is called a brāhmaṇa; he who is devoid of tapas and vedio study is a brābmaṇa only by birth (and not a real brābmana)&rsquo;. Similarly in another place Patañjali quotes a verse &lsquo;know this to be the auspicious sign of the best of brāhmaṇas, viz, whose lore, actions and birth are all three holy&rsquo; (vol. II. p. 220 on Pāṇ. IV. 1. 44). Though in the Mahābhārata</p>

<p>it is often said that a brāhmaṇa is 80 by birth alone and that he deserves respeot from all, still we meet several times with passages 409 wherein there is a revolt against the caste system dependent on birth alone and where it is severely condemned and great emphasis is laid on the moral worth of a man. In the Vanaparva (181. 42-43) we are told t10 ' Truthfulness, restraint, tapas, generosity, non-injury to sentient beings, constant adherence to dharma-these always lead men to the fruition (of their goal) and not caste nor family'. Udyogaparva ( 43. 20 ff. ) explains at great length what is meant by self-restraint. In the Santiparvaan (189.4 and 8) &lsquo;Truthfulness, generosity, free. dom from hatred and wickedness, humility, kindness, and tapas he is known as a brāhmana where these are seen. If these signs are seen in a sūdra and they do not exist in a brāhmana, then the sūdra would not be a śūdra and the brāhmaṇa would not be a brāhmana&rsquo;. In another place we are told 912 &lsquo;there is no difference between the varnas; the whole world is brāhma (the creation of Brahmā), since it was created by Brahmā in former ages and was evolved into varṇas by actions (or.occupations ).&rsquo; Udyogaparva 413 ( 43. 49 ) remarks &lsquo;Do not regard a person as brāhmaṇa by his talk; he who does not depart from truth is a brahmana&rsquo;; Vanaparva (216. 14-15) * that sudra who is always struggling for self-restraint, truthfulness and dharma is a brāhmaṇa in my opinion, for a brāhmaṇa is so by his character.'

<p>in spite of those sentiments the caste system dependent on birth has continued in all its strength and rigour for ages and writers like the Par. M. II. 1, p. 228 are emphatic in saying that between jāti and character one must look principally to the eminence of the caste.</p>
<p>In certain medieval works called Jātiviveka and in other works like the Sūdra-kamalākara ( first half of 17th century A. D.) several moro castes are mentioned, some of which are set out below.</p>
<p>Aghūsika or Andhasika-from a vaidehika male and a śūdra female; sells cooked food; also called Randhavanu.</p>
<p>Avartaka&ndash;from a bbrjjakantha and a brāhmaṇa woman.</p>
<p>Ahitundika&ndash;from a niṣāda and a vaideha female; called Gārudi in Marathi.</p>
<p>Aurabhra-called Dhangar in Marathi (tends rams and ewes for their wool),</p>
<p>Katadhūnaka&ndash;from āvartaka and a brāhmaṇa woman. Kuntalaka-the same as nāpita.</p>
<p>Kuruvinda-from a kumbhakāra and a kukkuta female. Same as modern sāli, according to Sūdrakamalakara.</p>
<p>Gholika from &amp; Vyādba male and gārudi female. He is called Undiramāru (rat-killer) in the vernacular.</p>
<p>Durbhara—from an āyogava and a dhigvaṇa woman; called Dohor ( or Dhor) in modern times.</p>
<p>Paustika&ndash;from a brāhmaṇa and a niṣāda female; called in modern times Kahāra or Bhol ( palanquin-bearer).</p>
<p>Plava-from a cāṇdāla and an andhra woman; called &lsquo;bādi&rsquo; in modern times.</p>
<p>Bandhula&ndash;from maitreya and jānghika female ; called Jbārekarl now ( who takes out gold particles from the dust at the doors of goldsmiths).</p>
<p>Bhasmānkura~from a Saiva fallen ascetio and a sūdra pro stitute; called Gurava by the Jātiviveka.</p>
<p>Manyum&ndash;from a vaisya and a kṣatriya female; called Tāvadia ( thief oatcher).</p>
<p>Romika~from malla and an avartaka woman; called Loṇār in modern times (manufacturer of salt).</p>
<p>Ch. II ]</p>
<p>Varna and modern castes</p>
<p>103</p>
<p>Salakya or Sakalya from a mālākāra and kāyastha woman; called Maniar.</p>
<p>śuddha-Mārjaka-called Mandali ( who gains livelihood by singing and playing on musical instruments ).</p>
<p>Sindolaka or spandālika, from a sūdra male and a māgadha female ; called Rangārl ( dyer ).</p>
<p>In modern times each of the principal varnas has numerous Bub-castes, based upon difference of country, occupation, sect and other causes. For example, brāhmaṇas are first divided into ten classes, five of them being Gaudas 14 and five Drāvidas. Among the Drāvida brāhmaṇas, the Mahārāstra brābmanas are again subdivided into numerous sub-castes such as the Cit pāvana (or Konkanastha), Karhāde, Deśastha, Devarukhe sto. It is said that in Gujerat there are 84 subcastes of brāhmaṇas, as most of which do not interdine nor intermarry. There is often a further distinction among the members of the same subcaste, viz, those who follow the priestly occupation and those who do not. The spirit of exclusiveness and ideas of superiority that arose in vedio times gradually led on to further and further divisons and subdivisions of people owing to geographical situation and other $10 causes. It appears that probably even in ancient times the brāhmaṇas of the north looked down upon the brāhmaṇas in eastern countries like Magadha. Vide notes 31-32 above and Fick (pp. 213-214). The Matsyapurāṇa ( 16. 16 ) says that brāhmaṇas who dwell in Mleccha countries, in Triśanku, Barbara, Odra (Orissa ), Andhra ( Telingana), Takka, Dravida and Konkana are not to be invited at śrāddhas.217</p>

It is only in the census reports prepared at great expense by the British Government after elaborate efforts and organization that the great complexity of the caste system in modern India is laid bare to the eye.

<p>THE DUTIES, DISABILITIES AND PRIVILEGES</p>
<p>OF THE VARŅAS</p>
<p>at sacrifit means of has certain</p>
<p>The duties and privileges of varnas occupy a very prominent place in all works on Dharmaśāstra. The study ( of the Vedas), offering sacrifices and giving gifts are said to be the duties absolutely enjoined on the brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya and vaiśya, 18 while each of these three varnas has certain peculiar privileges, which are its principal means of livelihood. Teach iog Vedas, officiating at sacrifices and receiving gifts-these are the privileges of brāhmaṇas; the profession of arms and protection of the people are the peouliar privileges of kṣatriyas; agriculture, rearing cattle, trade and inoney-lending are the peculiar privileges of vaisyas. The first three viz. study, sacrifices and liberality are said to be the dharmas of all dvijas and the other actions such as teaching the Veda are said to be the vrtti or jivikū( means of livelihood ) of the dvijas. The conse quence of this bifurcation is that if the first three are not performed or are negleoted, the person concerned was deemed to incur sia, while a brāhmaṇa is not bound necessarily to earn his livelihood by all or any one of the three viz. teaching, officiating at a sacrifice or receiving gifts.818 A few words on each of these duties and privileges must be said at this stage.</p>
<p>Study ( of Vedas). It has been already stated (p. 38 ) that brāhmaṇa and learning had become indissolubly connected even in early Vedio periods. We see in the Satapatha Br. and in the Upaniṣads that certain kings had attained eminence as philosophers or students of brahma-vidya and then even learned brāhmaṇas came to them as pupils. For example, Yājāavalkya learnt from Janaka (Sat. Br. XI. 6. 21.5), Bālāki Gārgya from</p>

<p>Vide Deussen&rsquo;s Das System des Vedanta !, 1883, (pp. 18-19 ) the real cherisher of thoso thoughts was originally the caste of the kpatriyas, rather than the caste of the priests. Over and over again we come across the situation that the brahmana asks the ksatriya for infor ination and Deussen refers only to six passages (Bș. Up. II, 1, VI. %, Ob. Up. V. 3 and V. 11 and Kauṣitaki Up. I, 1 and IV. 1). Vide also</p>

<p>Philosophy of the Upanisbads (translated by Goden, 1905, PP. 17–19). In the first place these are too few passages out of the vast Upanipad literature to found tho sweeping generalisation in which tho German savant indulges. In the second place in Br. Up. II. 1 and Kaupītaki Up. IV. there is no statement that brabmavidyd was known only to kpatriyas; on the contrary Ajātabatru expre8808 surprise tbat a brābmaga should approach a ksatriya for the expounding of brahma vidya and says that this is opposed to the natural (or usual) order of affairs. This shows that Ajatasatru was an exception and that brahmanas usually taught brahmavidya. In Kausitaki 1. 1. and Ch. Up, V. 11 all that is narrated is that Gautama Svetaketu learnt from Citra Gārgyāyadi and certain drotriyas like Aupamanyava learnt Vais. vāpara vidya from Aévapati Kaikoya. But nothing is said here about brahmavidyą being first known to kṣatriyas only. In Bṛ, Up. VI. 2 and Ch. Up. V. 11 it is no doubt stated that this Vidyā' was not known to any brahmana till then; but this vidya' does not mean the whole of the philosophy of brahma, but only that particular dootrine wbich bears the name of pañoāgnividya. This vidya no doubt propounds the doctrine of transmigration in a figurative and somewbat picturesque way. But that dootrine is elsewhere elaborated by brahmanas like Yājöavalkya to the brahma gas in king Janaka&rsquo;s court and to. Janaka himself (vido Bṛ. Up. III. 2. 13 and IV. 4. 3-4). Nor can it be said that the doctrine of transmigration was not at all known before the Upanigads. The same views aro eohood by Sir R, G. Bhandarkar in. Verhand-lungon der VII</p>

<p>Study of the Veda</p>
<p>107</p>
<p>drawn by certain writers that ksatriyas or kings were the pioneers in brahmavidyā cannot be accepted as correct. The germs of the philosophy of the Upaniṣads are seen in the later hymns of the Rgveda, in the Atharvaveda and in some of the Brābmana treatises. The Upanisads are full of brāhmaṇas who independently propounded various aspects of brahma-vidya and there is no reason to suppose that the few ksatriyas referred to as masters of the vidyā were the only persons who first attained to that position. There are hardly any ancient passages to show that vaisyas devoted any portion of their time to veda study. The Kāthaka-Samhitā 243 (IX. 16) indicates that all varnas studied the Veda since it speaks of a person not a brahmana, having studied (Vedio ) lores and yet not shining (by his learning).</p>
<p>As to brāhmaṇas the matter stands thus, The Nirukta (II. 4) contains four 224 verses ( which are called Vidyāsākta ), the first of which says that vidyā came to the brāhmaṇa and requested him to guard her as his treasure. The Mabābhaṣyales of Patañjali quotes as an agama (Vedic passage ) the words &lsquo;a brāhmaṇa should study and understand without any motive (of profit) dharma, the Veda with its six subsidiary lores ( viz. phonetics etc.)&rsquo;. Manu IV. 147 says &lsquo;a brāhmaṇa should always and assiduously study the Veda alone; that (Veda study) is his highest dharma; everything else is inferior dharma&rsquo;. Yāj. ( I. 198 ) observes the Creator created brāhmaṇas for the preservation of the Vedas, for the satisfaction of the</p>

Other 288 sages say that he in whose family Veda (Vedic study ) and vedi (congecration of fires for grauta rites ) are given up for three generations becomes a durbrāhmana (an unworthy or bad brāhmaṇa ). The Tai. S. (II, 1. 10. 1) prescribes a rite for a durbrāhmaṇa in whose family cessation of drinking soma occurred for generations and who himself desired to drink soma.</p>
<p>Teaching the Veda. It is probable that in very remote times the son was taught the Veda by his father. The story of Svetaketu Āruneya (Chāndogya V. 3. 1. and VI. 1. 1-% and Br. Up. VI. %. 1 ) shows that he learnt all the Vedas from his father and the legend in the Bṛ. Up. (V. 2. 1 ) that the gods, men and asuras learnt from their father Prajāpati points in the same direction.-27 Rg. VII. 103.5 shows that instruction was oral and consisted in the pupil repeating the words uttered by the teacher. *88 Whatever may have been the case in very remote times, from the times of the Brāhmaṇa literature and in the times of the dharmaśāstras teaching Vedio literature was almost universally in the hands of brāhmaṇas. Some ksatriya teachers or philoso phers are referred to in the Satapatha (VIII. 1. 4.10 and XI.6.2) and elsewhere, but they are generally held in low esteem. The Āp. Db. 8.248 (II. 2. 4. 25-28) lays down that the brāhmaṇa alone can be the teacher ( of a brāhmaṇa ), but in distress ( i. e. in the absence of a brāhmaṇa teacher ), a brāhmaṇa may learn from a kṣatriya or vaisya, but the only service (which as a pupil ) he should render to a ksatriya or vaiśya teacher is to go after him (and not shampooing his feet etc.) and after the brāhmaṇa finishes his study, the brahmana may go in front</p>

<p>( of:bis kṣatriya teacher), Gaut. (VII. 1-3) and Manu ( X. 1, II. 241 ) lay down the same rules. Manu ( II. 242 ) adds that a perpetual student (naisthika brabmacārl) should not stay as &amp; pupil with a teacher who is not a brāhmana and that a brāh. maṇa may learn even from a sūdra a useful or efficacious craft (II. 238 ). The profession of teaching the Veda could not have brought much money or wealth to brāhmaṇas, since very great emphasis was laid, as we shall see later, on teaching without any prior agreement about payment. It was the privilege of a brāhmaṇa alone to officiate as a priest. Jaimini230 says that, as the ksatriya and vaisya cannot be priests (rtviks ), the battra ( a sacrifice extending over many days or years ) could be performed only by brāhmaṇas. The Kātyāyana Srauta. sutra uses a similar argument. When Visvāmitra agreed to perform a sacrifice for Trisanku who had been cursed to be a cāṇdāla, the Rāmāyaṇa says that the gods and sages would not accept the oblations. It is doubtful whether the same rigid rule prevailed in ancient Vedio days. In Rg. X. 98. r it is said that Devāpi was the purohita of Santanu and the Nirukta (II. 10) adds that Devāpi and Santanu were brothers and des. cendants of Kuru. So, according to the Nirukta at least, a ksatriya could be a purobita in Vedio times. It may be admit ted that the Rg. itself does not expressly say that they were brothers. In modern times many writers often speak of brāh. manas as the priestly caste or as priests. But this is not a very accurate statement. All brāhmapes nover were nor are priests; besides even in modern times when caste is so rigid all priests in all temples and shrines are not brāhmaṇas. Some brāhmaṇas became the family priests (purohitas) of kings, many engaged as ýtviks at solemn srauta sacrifices or at domes tic rites and ceremonies. Temple priests are comparatively a later institution and they were generally looked down upon in olden times and are regarded as inferior even in modern times.433 Manu (III. 152 ) says that a devalaka i. e. a brābmana who took</p>

<p>The third means of livelihood permitted to brāhmaṇas was receiving gifts from a worthy or unblemished person. Accord ing to Yama238 quoted in the Sm. C. (I. p. 179 ) pratigraha (recei. ving gifts ) from &amp; worthy person of the three higher varṇas is superior to the acquisition of wealth by officiating as a priest or by teaching. But Manu ( X. 109-11 ) says that pratigraha from an unworthy person (or a sūdra ) is worse than the act of teaching him or officiating as a priest for him. Very elaborate rules were laid down about gifts i. e. who should receive gifts, from whon gifts may be received and on what ocoasions and what things were proper subjects of gift. The latter two matters will be discussed in detail later on. Here the rules about the per sons to whom gifts should be made and from whom they were to be accepted will be set out. It appears from the Bp. Up.(IV.1.3) that even in those ancient times there were prohibitions against receiving gifts from unworthy persons and officiating as priests for the unworthy. And the Bf, Up. ( V. 14. 5-6 ) suggests that it is only the learned who could properly accept large gifts.</p>
<p>In the first place, the ideal set before brāhmaṇas was one of poverty, of plain living and high thinking, of forsaking the aotive pursuit of riches and cherishing cultural preservation and advancement. Manu lays down the general rule that when not in distress a brāhmana should acquire wealth only just sufficient to maintain himself and his family, and to enable bim to perform his religious duties without causing any harm to others or by as little harm to others as possible and without unduly worrying his own body (IV, 2-3) and then Manu (IV. 7-8) says 34 that a brāhmaṇa householder may</p>

<p>either accumulate so much grain ( but not more ) as would fill a kusūla (a granary ), or a kumbha235 or he may have as much corn as would satisfy all his needs for three days or as much 88 will suffice for the day that is on and that out of these four each succeeding one was superior to each preceding one i. e. one who had no more accumulation of material goods than for the day itself (and who did not care for the morrow) was the best brāhmaṇa. Yāj. I. 128 speaks of a fifth grade viz, a brāhmaṇa should subsist by collecting the ears of corn that are left in the field after the crops are gathered or the single grains of corn so left and Manu (X. 112) says that if a brāhmaṇa cannot maintain himself he may prefer to live on the collection of fallen ears of corn or grains rather than receive gifts. This last mode is designated sta by Manu (IV.5). Manu (IV. 12, 15, 17 ) lays down that a brābmaṇa should cultivate supreme contentment and though desirous of happiness should restrain himself (in the pursuit of wealth), he should not, even when in distress, hanker after the acquisition of wealth by excessive attachment or by doing what is forbidden or by accepting gifts from any person whatever (of blemisbed character etc.) and he should give up pursuits that are opposed to ( cause obstacles in) his devotion to Vedio study. Yāj. ( I. 129 ) says the same thing in more concise language. Vyāga prescribes that a brāhmaṇa should seek to narrow down his means of livelihood and should not banker after excess of wealth; if he sets about accumulation of wealth he loses the ( glorious ) status of brāhmanya.236 The Mahābhārata says that when a brāhmana has more corn than he would require to satisfy his needs for three years, then he should offer a sacrifice with that wealth and he should not go on accumulating wealth in vain and that accumulation of vast wealth is a calamity for a brāhmaṇa.837</p>

<p>king (or a rich man) for his yogakṣema (i. e, for his livelihood and support). Manu (IV. 33 ), Yāj. (I. 130 ), and Vas. Dh. S. (XII. 2) declare that a brāhmana when oppressed by hunger should seek for help (or money ) from a king, from his pupil or from one who is able and willing to offer &amp; sacrifice. But &amp; brāhmaṇa should not receive a gift from an irreligious king or other irreligious donor. This implies that if the brāhmana is not hungry and has sufficient woalth either obtained by inheritance or partition or in any other way he should not go about soeking for wealth and should not receive gifts (Manu IV. 34 ). If a brahmana cannot secure gifts from the above three, then he may do so from any other worthy dvijāti. 838 When even that is not possible and the brāhmaṇa is in difficulties he was allowed to take a gift from anybody including a sūdra ( Manu X. 102-103, Yāj. III. 41 ); but a brāhmana should not seek gifts from a śūdra for the performance of a sacrifice or for agnihotra, as thereby he becomes &amp; cīṇdāla in another birth ( Manu XI. 24 and 42, Yāj. 1. 127). A brāhmaṇa trying to support his hungry elders ( parents etc.), his dependants ( wife, servants etc.), and about to worship gods and honour guests may accept a gift from anybody (except a patita ), but should not satisfy his own hunger with that wealth (Manu IV. 251, Vas. 14. 13, Viṣnu Dh. S. 57. 13, Yāj. I. 216 ). Yāj., however, allowed this even for one&rsquo;s own livelihood, Gaut. 239 ( 18. 24-25 ) allows a brābmaṇa to receive even from a sūdra as much as would enable him to finish marriage ceremonies on which he has embarked or to get materials for &amp; sacrifice when he has begun it. One may take gifts from a sūdra or ugra for paying a fee to one&rsquo;s guru at the end of the period of brahmacarya (Ap. Dh. S. I. 2. 7. 20-21 ). A brābmana was not to seek gifts from a king who was not of kṣatriya lineage nor from butchers, oilmen, keepers of liquor. shops and of brothels nor from courtesans ( Manu IV, 84 ), nor from a king who is avaricious and transgresses the rules of the tāstras $40 (Yāj. I. 140, Manu IV. 87). The Smrtis lay down</p>

<p>that it is the duty of the king to support śrotriyas ( brāhmaṇas learned in the Veda) and brāhmaṇas who are incapable of struggling for their maintenance (Gaut. X. 9-10, Yāj. III. 44, Atri 24) and that if a śrotriya perishes through hunger in the domains of a king, that country would suffer from famine and disease ( Manu VII. 134 ). Yāj. III. 44 lays down that it is the duty of a king to assign a proper means of livelihood to a brāhmaṇa in distress, having regard to the brāhmana&rsquo;s conduct, descent, learning, Vedio study, tapas, the members in his family. 341 The ideal set before brāhmaṇas in the matter of pratigraha ( receiving gifts ) was that he, who though entitled to aocept a gift (on account of bis Vedic learning and tapas ) does not take it, attains to the highest worlds ( Yāj. I. 213 ); and Manu (IV. 186 ) says that though entitled to accept gifts a brahmana should not again and again resort to that method, since the spiritual power ( due to Vedic study ) that he acquires is lost by accepting gifts. Another role about gifts is laid down in many works as follows. When a donor himself goes to the place of a worthy donee and makes a gift that is the best gift, when a donor calls &amp; donse to his place and makes a gift It is middling and when a donor gives if begged by a donee it is inferior, $42 Manu (IV. 188-191 ) prescribes that a man, who is not learned, is reduoed to ashes like fuel if he accepts &amp; gift of gold, land, horses, cows, food, clothes, 8e8ame and ghee, that a brāhmaṇa who, being devoid of learning and tapas (regulated life), desires to accept gifts sinks ( into Hell ) as one who sits in a stone boat sinks in water; and that therefore &amp; brahmana who is not learned should be afraid of receiving gifts.</p>

Just as a brāhmaṇa who was not learned was enjoined not to accept a gift, so conversely people were asked to make gifts only to learned and worthy men. Even so early as the Sat. Br. this is emphasized as in IV. 3. 4. 15 (S. B. E, vol. 26 p. 344 ) &quot; thus those cows of his are given to him who is fit to receive a dakṣiṇā and not to him who is unfit'. Vide III. 5.1.19 (S. B. E. vol. 26 D. 114) also, The Ap. Dh. S. (II. 6. 15. 9-10 ) prescribes one should invite for dinner in all religious acts brāhmaṇas who are pure and who have studied the Veda and one should distribute gifts at a proper time and place and on ocoasions of purificatory rites and when there is a worthy acceptor,' 243 To the same effect are Vas, Dh. 8. III, 8 and VI. 30, Manu (III. 128, 132 and IV. 31 ), Yaj. ( I. 201), Daksa III. 26 and 31.** The smrtis say that gifts given to a brāhmaṇa who has not studied the Veda or who is avaricious and deceitful are fruitless and lead the donor to hell ( Manu IV. 192-194, Atri 152, Daksa III. 29). Manu ( XI. 1-3 ) says that nine kinds of mātaka brahmanas who are poor are the primary objeots of the gift of food and fees inside the sacrificial altar; while to others food and wealth may be given outside the altar ( babirvodi ).</p>
<p>An exception was made in the case of gifts made without request from the donee. What has been offered unasked may be accepted even from one who is guilty of bad actions, except from unchaste women, impotent persons and patita (outcastes or persons guilty of mahāpātakas ) Yāj. I. 215, Manu IV. 248-49, Ap. Dh. 3. I. 6. 19. 11-14 ( where two verses are quoted from a Purāna which are almost the same as Manu IV. 248-249 ), Viṣṇu Dh. 8. 57. 11. Many persons are mentioned in the smṛtis from whom gifts ( particularly of food) were not to be accepted (vide Manu IV. 205-224, Vas. Dh. 8. XIV. 2-11).</p>
<p>Another rule about gifts was that a person should prefer a learned brahmana who is his neighbour for making a gift to one who is not near; if he did not do so, he incurred sin; but there was no blame in passing over an ignorant or foolish</p>

Devala quoted by Aparārka p. 288 and Par. M. I. part 1 p. 181 say that that brāhmaṇa is &amp; pātra (worthy to receive a gift) who is pure in three respects ( viz. as to his parents and his guru), whose means of livelihood are slonder, who is tender-hearted and of restrained senges. Vas. Dh. S. VI. 26 and Yāj. I. 200 also define pātra similarly.</p>
<p>It is not to be supposed that the ideal of poverty and non acceptance of gifts except under compelling circumstances was only an ideal hardly ever acted upon at any time or in any part of the country. Even in the 20th century rural India has villages with a considerable population of brāhmaṇas where many srotriyas ( learned in the Veda) and pandits ( those who study sāstras like grammar, logio, mimansā ) are still found who are content with what little patrimony they have got, who engage in the profession of teaching the Veda and sāstras in accordance with ancient rules and who do not go about seeking gifts nor accept invitations for dinner at ørāddhas. In the Santiparva 199 brāhmaṇas are divided into two sorts, viz. those who are pravștta (i. e. engage in all sorts of activities for aoquiring wealth) and those who are nivștta and verse 40 defines these latter as those who do not resort to pratigraha (acceptance of gifts ).</p>
<p>Though pratigraha was a special privilege of brāhmaṇas, gifts could be made by anybody to anybody. Yāj. I, 6 says that giving to a worthy person at &amp; proper time is the complete definition of dharma and Visvarūpa adds that gifts could be made by anybody ; but the merit secured by making a gift depended upon the worth and caste of the donee.

<p>28 say that a gift given to a brāhmaṇa ( who is only so by casto, but is not learned ), to a śrotriya (or ācārya ) and to one who has completely mastered all the Vedas ( with their subsi. diary lores ) respectively confers merit which is twice, a hun. dred thousand times or an infinite number of times more than the merit conferred by a gift to a non-brāhmana. Gautama 47 (V. 19-20 ) and Baudhāyana II. 3. 24 further make it obligatory to give outside the sacrificial altar according to one&rsquo;s ability a portion of one&rsquo;s wealth to a brāhmaṇa, śrotriya and veda pāraga when they seek help for giving &amp; dakṣiṇā to their teacher ( at the end of the period of studenthood ), for their own marriage, for medicine, for their own maintenance (that day ), for &amp; sacrifice, for their own study or journey, and when everything has been given in a Visvajit sacrifice and that one must give oooked food to all others who beg for it ( except brāhmana, sro triya and vedapāraga). Manu ( XI. 1-3) gives praotically the Bame rule. In the Vaiśvadeva the householder was enjoined to give food to every one including even dogs and cāṇdālas, as we shall see later on ( under848 Vaiśvadova). Medhatithi on Manu IV. 5 says that when a person makes a gift through compassion it is not the dana and pratigraha spoken of by the śāstra; just 88 when a man gives instruction as to what is beneficial he does not care to see what the caste of the person to be benefitted by the advies is, so &amp; gift made through compassion is made irrespec tive of caste; and that when non-brāhmaṇas reduced to a help legs condition take what is given by others, it cannot be said that they are assuming to themselves the livelihood by prati graha which is a peculiar means of livelihood for brāhmaṇas.869</p>

<p>117</p>
<p>In spite of the noble ideal set before brāhmaṇas it appears that, owing to the growth of the Brāhmaṇa population and the paucity of gifts and invitations to officiate as priests, the strict rules about dāna and pratigraha had to be relaxed and in course of time it came to be said that a brāhmaṇa, whether learned or ignorant, was to be a donee and may accept gifts without any scruples. The first inroade50 was made by the rule that in rites meant for gods the character and learning of brāhmaṇas need not be deeply inquired into, but that such enquiry was proper only when they were to be invited for śrāddha and other rites for the dead, the only exceptions being that a brāhmana, who is a thief or is guilty of a mahāpātaka, or is impotent or an atheist was not to be invited even in rites for the gods ( vide Manu III. 149-150). Gradually such views as the following came to be recommended. The Skandapurāṇa si as quoted by Aparārka (p. 455 ) makes Siva Bay to Pārvati &lsquo;the Vedic revelation is that śrāddha (food) should be given (to &amp; brāhmaṇa ) after inquiry (into his learning and character), but straightforward action is better than sorutiny. When one offers srāddha straightforwardly without scrutiny, his pitrs are satisfied and also gods.&rsquo; The Vṛddha-Gautama smrti (chap. III pp. 512-513 and 518, Jiv.) says &lsquo;Brāhmaṇas, whether well conducted or of bad conduct, whether vulgar or of polished intellect, should not be disrespected like fires covered with ashes. Just as fire in whatever condition it may be, is a great deity, 80 a brāhmaṇa is a great deity in whatever condition he may be. 251 &ldquo;The wise should not despise brāhmaṇas, whether they be squint eyed, humpbacked, dwarfs, indigent or diseased, since they are</p>

<p>my forms (1. e. of Krsna)&rsquo;. The Anusasanaparva (152.19 )*** Bayr&rsquo;a brāhmaṇa who is not learned is a god and he is a worthy object for gifts and is a great purifier; a learned brahmana is a greater god ( than an unlearned one ).&rsquo;</p>
<p>As already said above teaching could have brought very little wealth. There was no state educational system as in modern times with stability of tenure and graded rates of salary, Nor was there any copyright Act under which a learned man could make money by writing books for students and the general public. The brāhmaṇas had no organised corporate body like the Anglioan Churoh with its hierarchy of Archbi shops, Bishops and other divines, nor was there in anoient India any practice of making wills whereby large estates came to the Church as in England ( where statutes of Mortmain bad to be passed to prevent enormous estates from going to the Church ).184 The emoluments of officiating priests and gifts given by charitably disposed persons must have been fitful and offered only a precarious means of livelihood, as they depended upon the volition of others and as the smrtis recommended that even in srāddha too many brāhmaṇas should not be invited.5$ Besides all brāhmaṇas could not bave possessed the memory, intelligence and patience required to master the Vedic Literature after intensive study for decades of years. Therefore, there is no wonder that many brāhmaṇas were compelled by the force of circumstances to pursue for their livelihood avocations other than the three pregoribed ones. From ancient times this was recognised by the dharmaśāstra works. Gaut. (VII. 6 and 7) gays that if a brābmana cannot maintain himself by means of the three peculiar modes of livelihood viz. teaching or officiating as a priest for even an unworthy person or by receiving gifts, then he should maintain himself by doing the work peculiar to a kṣatriya (i. e. by fighting and proteoting people ) and if even that is not possible then by following the avocations of a vaisya and Gaut. VII. 26 ordains that a kṣatriya may resort to the profession of the vaisya in similar circumstances. Baudhāyana</p>

<p>Dh. 8. (IL 2.77 ) says the same and then it adds ( II. %. 78 and 80) that Gautama says that it should not be so as the duties of a kṣatriya would be too terrific for a brāhmana and that he should pursue the avocation of a vaisya. Baudhayana (1. 1. 20) notes that the profession of arms was practised by the brāhmaṇas of the north. Vas. Dh. 8. (II. 22) lays down that persons (of the three higher yarnas) should, if they cannot maintain themselves by the peculiar avocations of their varna, resort to the means of livelihood prescribed for the varna which is immediately below their own, Manu X. 81-82, Yaj. III. 35, Narada (rnādāna 56 ), Viṣnu Dh. S. 54. 28, Saṅkba-Likhita say the same 856 tbing. It is further laid down by the same works that a person belonging to a lower varna should not resort to the modes of livelihood peculiar to a bigher varṇa (vide Vas. Dh. S. II. 23, Manu X. 95). The smptis further ordain that when the calamity or distress ceases, the person who has taken to the avocations of another vārṇa should perform prāyaścitta, should resume his proper avocations and abandon the wealth acquired by him by resorting to improper avocations ; vide Manu XI. 192-193; Viṣnu Dh, S. (54. 27-28), Yaj. III. 35, Nārada ( rṇādāna 59-60). Manu (X. 96 ) prescribes that, if &amp; person of a lower varṇa maintains himself through greed by the avocation 857 peculiar to a higher varpa, the king should confisoate the wealth and should at once banish him from the country. A classical example of the keenness with which good kings were expected to prevent persons of lower varnas doing the actions allowed only to higher varnas is furnished by the story of Sambūka narrated in the Rāmāyaṇa (VII. 73-76.) The Uttararāmacarita of Bhavabhūti echoes the same sentiments. A śūdra888 who engaged in japa, homa, tapas or became an ascetic or repeated ( Vedio ) mantras was to be punished (or killed) by the king and was also guilty of mortal sin.

<p>actions proper for a gūdra viz. Berving members of the twice born classes. It is also said by Gaut. (VIL 22-24) that a brahmana may maintain himself in any way if unable to maintain himself (by the three means specially prescribed for him), but he should not resort to the actions peculiar to a sūdra, that according to some ācāryas he may do even those actions when life itself is in danger, but that when he stoops to the aotions peculiar to sūdras for maintenance he should not mix himself up with members of that varna (by sitting on the same seat with them eto.) or eat articles forbidden to brāhmaṇas (such as leek and garlio) and should not be a mere monial servant. Vide Manu (IV, 4 and 6) and Narada (rṇādana 57).</p>
<p>According258 to all anoient authorities the special duty of the sūdra was to render service to the twice-born classes, to obtain his livelihood from them and serving a brāhmaṇa conferred grea ter happiness or benefit on the sūdra than serving a kṣatriya and serving a ksatriya conferred greater good than serving a vaisya. According to Gaut. (X. 60-61), Manu (X. 124-125 ) and others, the gūdra was to wear the old or cast-off clothes, umbrellas, sandals, mattress etc. of his patron and the leavings of food (ucchiṣta ) were to be given to him. If he beoame old and unable to do work while serving anyone of the higher Varnas he was to be fed by him whom he had formerly served (Gaut. X. 63). In course of time the position of the sūdra improved. If a sūdra 80 was unable to maintain himself and his family by serving dvijas, he was allowed to maintain himself by having recourse to crafts like carpentry or drawing or painting pictures etc. Nārada (rṇādāna 58 ) allowed him to perform the work of ksatriyas and vaisyas in times of distress. Yaj (1. 120) also says that, if unable to maintain himself by the service of dvijas, the sūdra may carry on the profession of a vaisya or may take to the various orafts. The Mababharata allowed &amp; gudra&rsquo;i who could not maintain</p>

<p>himself by the service of higher varnas to resort to the avocations of a vžibya, to rearing cattle and to orafts. Others like Laglu-Āśvalāyana (22.5), Vrddha-Hārsta ( VII. 189, 192 ) allowed agriculture to the sūdra. The Kālikāpurāna quoted in the Gr. R. (p. 479 ) allowed the sūdra to sell all commodities except honey, skins, lāksā (lac), wines and flesh, while Bṭhat-Parāśara (p. 101 ) prohibited the sūdra from selling wine and flesh. Devala quoted in the Mit. (on Yāj. I. 120 ) prescribes that the sūdra should serve the twice-born and may engage in agriculture, rearing cattle, carrying loads, sale of commodities, drawing and painting, dancing, singing and playing on musical instruments like the flute, lute, drums and tabors. 268 The foregoing will show that the sūdra gradually rose in social status so far as occupation was concerned and could follow all occupations except those specially reserved for the brāhmana, 80 much so that sūdras became even kings and Manu (IV. 61 ) bad expressly to enjoin upon brābmanas not to dwell in the kingdom of a sūdra. 263 The smṛtis however did not like that wealth should be accumulated in the hands of the śūdra (though they were quite willing that kṣatriyas and vaisyas should command all wealth ). Gaut. (X. 64-65 ) says that the sūdra&rsquo;s accumulation of wealth should be for the support and benefit of the other varnas. Manu (X. 129) says that a śūdra, even though able to accumulate wealth, should not do so, as ( on account of his pride of wealth and his ignorance ) he may cause obstructions and trouble to brāhmaṇas. Sūdras were divided into numerous subcastes. But there were two main divisions. One was aniravasita sudras (such as carpenters and blacksmiths) and the other niravasita śūdras (like cāṇdālas ); vide note 200 above. Another division of sūdras was into those who were bhojyānna (i. e. food prepared by whom could be partaken by brāhmaṇas ) and abhojyānna. In the first were included one&rsquo;s</p>

So it follows that Manu did not hold the view propounded in certain Pura pas that after the Nandas there would he no ksatriya kings and only sudras will be kings.</p>

<p>slave, one&rsquo;s cowherd, barber, family friend and one who shared with one the crop reared on one&rsquo;s land (vide Yāj. I. 166). It is worthy of note that even the Mit. adds the potter to the above list. All the other sūdras were such that a brāhmana could not take his food. A third and well-known division was into sacchūdra ( well-conducted) and asac-chūdra. The former class included those śūdras who followed good occupations or trade, served dvijas and had given up meat and drinking or selling liquor. 204 The Sūdrakamalakara (p. 60.) says that agat-sūdras do not incur sin even if they partake of meat and liquor, provided they do not eat forbidden meat and that there is no lapse if one comes in contact with a sūdra that drinks liquor.</p>
<p>A few words may now be said about brāhmaṇas being allowed to follow the occupations of kṣatriyas and vaisyas. From very ancient times brāhmaṇas appear to have followed the profession of arins, Pān (V. 2. 71) teaches 285 the formation of the word &lsquo;brāhmaṇaka&rsquo; as applied to a country, which means &ldquo;in which Brāhmaṇas follow the profession of arms. Kaut.866 (IX.2) quotes the view of the acāryas that when there are armies composed of brāhmaṇas, kṣatriyas, vaisyas and sūdras each preceding one is better for enlistment than each subsequent, but Kaut himself is against this and adds that the enemy may win over the army of brābmanas by prostration before them. Apastamba was against the idea of brāhmaṇas following the profession of arms. He says (I. 10. 29. 7)267 ' a brāhmaṇa should not catch hold of a weapon oven for examining it (much</p>

<p>less for attacking others with it)&rsquo;. Gaut. (VII. 6) allowed &amp; brāhmaṇa to follow ksatriya&rsquo;s profession in case of distress (āpad ) and adds ( in VII. 25 ) that even a brāhmaṇa while still following the peculiar avocation of a brābmana may wield weapons when his life is in danger. The Baud. Dh. S. (II. 2, 80) quotes a verse&rsquo; for saying cows and brāhmaṇas, for preventing the mixture of varṇas, the brābmana and vaisya may take to arms from their concern for dharma,' The Vas. Dh. S.(111. 24) allows a brāhmana to wield &amp; weapon for protecting himself and for pre venting confusion or mingling of vernas. Manu (VIII. 348-349) allows all dvijūtis to resort to weapons where the observance of dharma (or of the duties of varnas and āśramas ) is obstructed (by violent men), when there is a disturbance (due to invasion etc. ) involving the twico-born classes, in evil times for protect ing one&rsquo;s self, when there is an attack for carrying away cows or other wealth ( given as fees) and in order to protect women and brāhmaṇas and he incurs no sin if he kills ( for these pur poses). Among the heroes of the Mahābhārata there are great warriors and commanders like Drona, his son Aśvatthaman, Krpa (the maternal uncle of Ağvatthāman) who were brāhmaṇas, The Mahābhārata says that a brāhmaṇa slıould fight at the order of the king.288 The Sāntiparva (78.18 ) calls upon persons of all varnas to wield arms when the rules for holding society to gether are broken and when dasyus (robbers or low persons ) cause confusion. From ancient times we find brāhmaṇas as commanders and founders of royal dynasties. The famous Senāpali Puṣyamitra belonged to the Sunga gotra and wrested an empire from the last of the Mauryas about 184 B.O. His line was followed by the Kāṇvāyanas, the founder being minister Vāsudeva, a brābmana, who killed the last Sunga about 72 B. O. We learn from the Talagunda pillar inscription of Kakusthavarman ( E. I. Vol. VIII. p. 24 ) that the founder of the Kadambas, Mayūraśarman, was a brāhmaṇa. In Maratha history there were the Peshwas and other brāhmana warriors and commanders.</p>
<p>Though it is said that a brāhmaṇa in distress may follow the occupation of a vaisya, there were several restrictions imposed upon brāhmaṇas following the occupations of money. lending, agriculture, trade, and the rearing of cattle, which were proscribed as the privileged occupations of vaisyas.</p>

<p>As to money-lending, Gaut.269 (X. 5-6) allowed &amp; brābinana to maintain himself and his family by agriculture, sale of commodities and money-lending only if he did not engage in these personally, but through the agency of others. Vas. Dh. S. (II. 40 ) enjoins upon brāhmaṇas and kṣatriyas not to lend money like usurers and quotes two verses which define usury and say that a userer is a greater singer than even one who is guilty of brāhmana-murder, Manu (X. 117) also forbids usury to brābinanas and kṣatriyas, but allows them to charge a low rate of interest to persons engaged in low actions. Nārada (rṇādāna 111 ) forbids usury to brābmanas even in the direst calamnities. Ap. Dh, S. (I. 9. 27. 10) prescribes a prāyaścitta 370 for a brāhmana lending money at usurious rates. Bphaspati as quotedPri in the Gr. R. has a rather amusing Verse &lsquo;sages have enumerated numerous means of livelihood, but out of all of them money-lending is pre-eminent. There is loss in agriculture due to draught, to the fear of the exactions of the king and the ravages of rats and others, but there is no such loss in money-lending. It appears that this is only a general or satirical statement and does not recommend money lending to brāhmaṇas.</p>
<p>The obvious reasons and motives underlying these restric tions on brāhmaṇas were to make them live simple lives, to insist on the necessity and high value to themselves and to society of studying, preserving and augmenting the ancient literature and oulture, to emphasize the fact that a highly spiritual life should not be given up for a mere secular life, to prevent the coarsening and hardening of the heart and emotions in a relentless and continuous pursuit of wealth or martial glory.</p>

<p>brāhmaṇas. The Vedic Literature does not condeinn agriculture in the case of brāhmaṇas. The gambler&rsquo;s song 273 (Rg. X. 34 ) winds up with the exhortation &lsquo;do not play with dice, do engage in agriculture, thinking highly of my words (or of wealth ), do find joy in wealth, in that ( in agriculture) there are cows, there is your wife &amp;c.&rsquo; There are frequent references in Vedic Litera ture to fields, ploughshares and tilling the soil ( vide Rg. X. 101,3</p>
<p>=Tai.S.IV.2.5.5, Vāj. S. XII. 67, Rg. I. 110.5, I. 176.2, X. 117. 7). Baudhāyana 273 says (1.5. 101). The study of the Veda tends to the destruction of agriculture and ( devotion to) agriculture tends to the loss of the study ) of the Veda. One who has the capacity (to look after both ) may rogort to both, but he wbo is unable (to look after both) should give up agriculture&rsquo;. Baudhāyana further says (II. 2. 82-83) &lsquo;&amp; brābnana should engage in agriculture before his morning meal and he should only coax again and again his oxen whose noses bave pot been pierced and whose testicles are not reinoved and without prodd. ing them with a pointed awl&rsquo;. The Vas. Dh. S. ( II. 32-34 ) has a similar sūtra, adds that in summer he shall water his beasts (in the morning ) and quotes Vāj. S. XII. 71. Manu ( X. 83-84 ) says &lsquo;a brāhmaṇa or a ksatriya compelled to follow the avocations of a vaiśya (owing to difficulty of maintenance otherwise ) should by all means avoid agriculture wbich is full of injury to sentient beings and dependent on others (labourers, oxen &amp;c.). Some regard agriculture as a good mode of liveli hood but it is condemned by the good, (as) wood having an iron tip (i, e, the plough) strikes the earth and (the insects and germs) imbedded in the earth.&rsquo; Manu IV. 5 designated agricul ture by the word &lsquo;pramta&rsquo; (pre-eminent in loss of life). Hārita quoted 374 in Gr. R. p. 429 declares &lsquo;the ploughshare (i. e. agrioulture ) carries with it destruction of life, therefore it is not for brāhmaṇas; but if he were to follow it (agriculture ) in distress he should pursue it only till bis object (of tiding over</p>

<p>distress) is accomplished&rsquo;. Parāśara 87$ (I1. 2-4, 7, 14) allows a brābmapa to engage in agriculture, but lays down certain restrictions. The proper number of oxen to be yoked to the plough is eight, six being middling, four are yoked only by the cruel and two by those who sacrifice the lives of their oxen; he should not yoke an ox that is hungry, thirsty or tired, he should make the oxen work only for half the day and then bathe them</p>
<p>in water, he should offer the five mahāyajñas and other sacrifices with corn raised by himself engaging in agriculture, the sin of ploughing the earth for a day with an iron-tipped ploughshare is equal to that incurred by a fisherman fishing for a year; he should give of the corn to the king, offer it to gods and go to brāhmaṇas and then he may not be smeared with sin'. Harita quoted by Aparārka (p. 937) has a long prose passage on the treat ment to be given to oxen by brāhmaṇas and also Vrddha-Gau tama (Jiy. part 2 p. 571). Vṭddha-Hārita 276 (VII. 179 and 182 ) says that agrioulture is common to all verṇas and agriculture, rearing cattle and service are not forbidden to any. The above discussion shows how agriculture was viewed at different times and by different writers from different points of view.</p>
<p>Sale and barter-We have seen above that &amp; brāhmana is allowed to maintain himself by trade in distress or difficulties (ūpad). But there were very great restrictions as to what things could be sold by a brāhmaṇa. According to Gaut. (VII. 8-14) &amp; brāhmaṇa should not engage in the sale of fragrant things (like sandal-wood ), fluids (like oils, ghee &amp;c.), cooked food, Besame, hemp (and hempen articles like bags ), kṣauma (linen), deer-skin, dyed and cleanly washed clothes, milk and its products (like curds &amp;c.), roots, flowers, fruits, herbs ( used as drugs ), honey, meat, grass, water, deleterious drugs (like opium, poison), animals ( for being killed), men (as elaves), barren cows, heifers and cows liable to abortion. He adds (Gautama VII. 15 ) that according to some a brāhmaṇs could not sell land, rice, yava, goats and sheep, horses, bulls, freshly delivered cows and</p>

<p>oxen that are yoked to carts. These restrictions did not apply to a kṣatriya engaging in trade. Āp. Dh. 8. 1. 7. 20. 12-13877 has a similar list but adds among forbidden articles of sale' weapons, sticky things (śleṣma, like lac), young stalks ( tokma ), fer mented liquids (kiṇva), the expectation of merit (sukrtāsā ) and says that among corns sesame and rice are on no account to be sold. Baud. Dh. S. II. 1. 77-78 condemns the sale of Besame and rice by saying that he who sells them sells respec tively his pitīs (dead ancestors ) and his prānas. This arose probably from the close connection of sesame with śrāddha and tarpana. Vas. Dh. S. ( 11. 24-29) gives a similar list and adds a prohibition against the sale of stones, salt, silk, iron, tin, lead, all wild animals, all tame animals with uncloven hoofs and those that have a mane, birds and animals having fangs. It quotes a verse at II. 27 ( which is the same as Manu X. 92) &lsquo;a brābmana immediately becomes a sinner by the sale of meat, lac and salt and be becomes &amp; sūdra by selling milk for three days&rsquo;. About sesamo, Baud. Dh. 8.478 ( II. 1. 76), Manu ( X. 91 ) and Vas. Dh. 8. (II. 30 ) present the same verse. If a man deals with sesame in any way other than eating them or using them for bathing (i. e. applying sesamum oil to the body before a bath ) and making a gift of them, becomes a worm and sinks together with his pitps in the ordure of a dog'. But it appears that Vasiṣtha 278 (II. 31), Manu (X. 90) allow the sale of sesame if a man engages in agriculture and himself produces them (but sale must be only for purposes of religious duties, according to Manu ). Yāj. (III. 39) and Nārada ( rṇādāna 66 ) say that Besame may be bartered for an equal measure of other corn to raise means for religious purposes and for medioine also socording to Nārada). Manu (X. 86-89), Yaj. (III. 36-38), Nārada (rnādāna 61-63 ) give long lists of articles that Brāhmaṇas were forbidden to sell and that inolude a few more than those specified above. For example, Manu forbids the sale of bee&rsquo;s wax, kusa, indigo, while Yāj. adds soma, mud, blankets made of goat wool, hair (of camari deer ) and oilcakes ( pinyāka ) to things forbidden to</p>

<p>be sold. Saṅkha-Likhita,280 Udyoga-parva 38. 5, śāntiparva 78. 4-6, Harita (as quoted by Aparārka p. 1113) contain long lists of things the sale of which was forbidden to brāhmaṇas. Apart from these negative rules, there are some that are positive and prescribe what may be sold. For example, the Baud. Dh. S.81 prescribes the sale of grass and wood in their natural state and quotes a verse Oh! Brahmana, these are the articles you may sell, viz., domestic animals that have only one row of teeth, minerals except salt and threads (i. e. cloth ) that are not coloured with some dye.' Nārada 288 (rṇādāna 64-65) states' a brāhinana may sell dried wood and grass, except fragrant articles, eraka (a kind of grass), rattan, cotton, roots, kusa grass; cereals that get split up of their own accord, badara and inguda among fruits, cords and threads of cotton provided they are not coloured'. Saṅkha-Likhita also (as quoted by Aparārka p. 933) have the same rules as Nārada and further enjoin upon the brāhmaṇa not to higgle for the price but to have a fixed price.</p>
<p>___Yaj. (III. 40) says that the sale of lac, salt and meat lead to a brāhmaṇa&rsquo;s fall (i. e, he loses the right to perform the duties of dvijātis) and the sale of milk, ourds and liquor reduces him to the status of a low class (i. e. of a sūdra). Manu (XI. 62). Visnu Dh. S. (37.14)and Yaj. (III. 234) include the sale of for bidden articles among upapātakas and Yāj. (III. 265) prescribes cāndrāyana and other prāyaścittas for it. Hārita ( quoted by Aparārka p. 1113 and Mit. on Yaj. III. 265 ) prescribes various prāyaścittas for the sale of various forbidden articles. Laghu Sātātapa prescribes ( v.87 ) cāndrāyana for the sale of honey, meat, wine, soins, lac, salt.283 Nārada (rṇādāna 67 ) calls upon</p>

<p>the king to inflict a heavy fine upon a brāhmaṇa who engages in the sale of artioles forbidden to be sold and strays from the path ( proper for brāhmaṇas ) in the absence of distress.</p>
<p>Ap. Dh. 8. (I.7. 20. 14-15 )284 states the goneral rule that exchange or barter also of those articles that are forbidden to be sold cannot be resorted to, but adds that barter is allowed of foods with foods, of slaves with slaves, of fragrant things with other fragrant things, of one kind of learning with another. Gaut.285 (VII. 16-21 ) allows the exchange of rasas with rusas, of domestic animals with other domestic animals, of cooked food with an equal measure of uncooked food for immediate use, but forbids the barter of salt, cooked food and sesame with other articles. Manu ( X. 94 ) allows the exchange of onu rasa ( liquid like molasses ) with another (like ghee ), of cooked food with uncooked food, of sesame with an equal quantity of other corn, but does not allow the barter of Balt for any rasa. Vas. Dh, S. (II. 37-39 ) has rules similar to Manu and Āp.286</p>
<p>Manu (X. 116 )287 enumerates ten means of maintaining oneself in āpad ( distress ) viz. learning, arts and crafts, work for wages, service ( i. e. currying out another&rsquo;s orders), rearing cattle, sale of commodities, agriculture, contentment, alms, money-lending. Out of these some cannot be followed by a brāhmaṇa or a kṣatriya when there is no distress (e. g. a brāhmaṇa cannot engage in service). Yāj. III.42 enumerates seven of these and adds &lsquo;cart&rsquo; (i. e. driving carts for hire ), mountain ( subsisting on the price of grass and fuel taken from hills ), a country full of water, trees and shrubs, king (i. e. resorting to or begging from a king).

<p>speaks of nine means of livelihood in &amp; season of drought, viz. Oart, plot of vegetables, cows, fishing, asyandana (main taining oneself by the slightest effort possible ?), forest, a country full of water, trees and shrubs, &amp; mountain, king. Nārada (rṇādāna 50-55 ) says that three modes of soquiring wealth are common to all, viz. inheritance, a gift of friendli ness or affection and what comes to a man with a wife ( at the time of marriage ); that each of the three varnas has three special modes of acquiring wealth, viz., receiving gifts, fees as priest and fees for teaching in the case of brāhmaṇas; booty in war, taxes and fines in judicial trials in the case of ksatriyas ; agriculture, rearing cattle and sale of commodities in the case of vaisyas. Nārada ( rṇādāna verses 44-47 ) divides wealth into śukla ( white, pure), sabala ( dark-white, mixed) and krsna (dark ) and each of these into seven varieties. The Viṣnu Dh. S. chap. 58 also divides the wealth of householders into these three varieties and says that what is earned by the special modes prescribed for each varṇa, inherited wealth, gifts of affection and what comes with the wife-these are sukla (pure ); what is obtained by following the special avocation of the varna immediately lower than one&rsquo;s own varna and what is acquired by giving bribes or by sale of forbidden articles or from one who is under one&rsquo;s obligations is sabala; what is obtained by following the avocations of a varna other than the immediately lower one and what is acquired by gambling, theft, violence or fraud is called kroṇa. Baud, Dh. S. (III. 1. 5-6 ) speaks of ten kinds of vrttis ( means of livelihood) and III, 2 explains them at length. Manu (IV. 4-6 ) speaks of five ways of livelihood viz. rta ( i. e. subsisting on grains left in the fields ), amita ( what comes without begging), mrta (alms obtained by begging ), pramṛta ( agriculture ), satyānrta (sale of commodities ) and forbids svavṛtti ( service, lit. living like a dog ). Manu (IV. 9) further says that some brābmanas live by six means (i. e. adhyāpana, yājana, pratigraha, agriculture, rearing cattle and trade), some by three ( viz. the first three ), some by two (yājana and adhyāpana ) and others again only by one (adhyāpana ).</p>
<p>The avocations practised by brāhmaṇas in the pursuit of wealth were many and varied, so much so that from very ancient times the lists of brāhmaṇas not eligible for invitation at srāddhas because they followed unworthy oallings were very formidable. Atri (Anan, ed.) verses 379-383 names ten kinds of brahmanas and briefly defines them, viz. deva-brahmana ( who</p>

( who is given up to staying in a forest, subsists on roots, fruits and vegetables and performs daily grāddhag ), dvija-br. (who studies the Vedānta, gives up all attachments and is engaged in reflec. ting over Sāmkhya and Yoga ), kṣatra-br. (who fights), vaisya-br. (who engages in agriculture, rearing cattle and trade ), sūdra-br. (who sells lac, salt, dyes like kusu mbha, milk, ghee, honey, mest), niṣāda-br. ( who is a thief and robber, a backbiter and always fond of fish and meat), pasu-br. ( who knows nothing about brahma and is only proud of bis wearing the sacred thread), mleccha-br. (who obstructs or destroys wells, tanks, gardens, without any qualm )and candālā-br. ( who is &amp; fool, devoid of prescribed rites, beyond the pale of all dharma apd cruel ). Atri (384) rather 289 humorously adds &lsquo;those who are devoid of Vedic lore, study the śāstras (like grammar, logio &amp;c.), those devoid of śāstric lore study purānas (and earn money by reciting thein), those who are devoid even of purāṇa reading become agriculturists, those who are devoid oven of that become bhāgavatas ( pose as great devotees of Siva or Viṣnu i. e. become what is called in modern Marathi&rsquo; buvā').' Devala quoted 890 by Aparārka (pp. 284-285 ) speaks of eight kinds of brāhmaṇas (of whom each succeeding one is superior to each preceding one) viz. mātra (one who is only born in a brāhmana family but has not studied any part of the Veda nor performs the actions appropriate to brāhmaṇas ), brāhmaṇa ( who has studied a portion of the Veda ), śrotriya ( who has studied one vedic sākhā with the six angas and performs the six duties of brāhmaṇas ), anūcāna (who knows the meaning of the Veda and the vedāngas, is of pure heart and has kindled the sacred fires), bhrūna ( who besides being anūcāna always performs yajñas and eats wbat is left after performing yajñas ), rṣikalpa ( who has gained all worldly and Vedic knowledge, and has his mind</p>

Sātātapa equoted by Aparārka (pp. 286-287) speaks of six classes of persons who, though born brāhmaṇas, are really not brāhmaṇas viz. one who has taken service with a king, one who engages in sale and purcbage (of commodities ), one who officiates for many yajamānas, one who is the officiating priest for the whole village, one who is in the service of a village or town, one who does not perform sandhyā adoration in the morning and evening at the proper time. The Anuśāsanaparva ( 33. 11 ff) shows that some brāhmaṇas were great rogues, others engaged in austerities, some resorted to agriculture and rearing cattle, others subsisted by begging, some were thieves and others were false, some were acrobats and dancers (but it yet recom&rsquo;nends that brāhmaṇas must be honoured).</p>
<p>The smstis teach that brāhmaṇas doing certain things are to be treated as sūdras. For example, Baud. 292 Dh. 8. (II. 4. 20 ) requires a religious king to employ brāhmaṇas who do not perform the morning and evening adoration ( sanuhyā) in doing work appropriate to sūdras. Vas.293 Dh. S. (III. 1-2) says that brāhmaṇas who are not śrotriyas (learned in the Veda ), who do not teach the veda or who do not kindle the sacred fires become reduced to the status of sūdras and quotes a Mānava śloka ( Manu II. 168) &lsquo;that a brāhmaṇa who without studying the Veda works hard to master something else is quickly reduced while still living to the status of a śūdra together with his family.&rsquo; Manu ( VIII. 102=Baud.

Vide Manu X. 92 quoted above (p. 127). Parāśara ( VIII. 24) says 29+ that 8 brābmana who does not repeat the Gāyatri mantri is more impure than even &amp; Śūdra and that brāhmaṇas who do not offer oblations to sacred fires, who are bereft of samdhyā adoration and who do not study the veda are all sūdras and that therefore one should study at least a portion of the veda if he cannot study the whole. Manu (V. 4) 295 sums up in one place the reasons why brāhmaṇas are seized by Death before the allotted span of human life' on account of not studying the Vedas, on account of giving up the rules of conduct prescribed for them, through idleness and through the faults arising from (partaking forbidden ) food, Death desires to kill brāhmanes.'</p>
<p>A few words must be said about begging. The smṛtis prescribe begging as specially appropriate to brahmacārins (vedio students) and ascetics (yatis ), which will be dealt with at length later on. Begging was not allowed to others except under considerable restrictions. The king of Kekaya 496 is made to boast in the Mahābhārata (Sand 77. 22 ) that no one who is not a brabmacārin begs in his kingdom Gifts of food were to be made daily while performing the five mahāyajñas (this will be treated under vai vadova). Ap. Db. S. II. 5. 10. 1-4 recognizes that begging can properly be resorted to for the following reasons, viz. for the teacher, for ( one&rsquo;s first) marriage, for &amp; sacrifice, in anxiety to support one&rsquo;s parents, for warding off the non-observance of the duties of a worthy person ; he onjoins that on these oocasions there is a duty to give according to one&rsquo;s ability and according to the worth of the person begging and that if a man bogs only for the gratification of his senses (and not for pressing wants) one should pay no heed to such 207</p>

<p>begging. Vas. Dh. S. XII. 2-3 says that a man oppressed by hunger may beg for a little viz. &amp; cultivated or uncultivated plot, a cow, &amp; sheep or ewe, and at last gold, corn or cooked food; but a snālaka should not faint through hunger ; this is the instruction'. Vide Manu X. 114 for practically the same words and Viṣṇu Dh. 8. 3. 79-80. Baud Db. 8. II. 1. 64 includes begging by one who has finished his course of studenthood among actions that make a man impure (aśucikara). Manu XI. 16-17 says that when a person has had no food for three days he may take away (by theft even) from one who is lower than bimself in class as much corn as will be enough for one day, either from the threshing floor or from the field or from his house or from whatever place he oan get it, but he should announce his eotion when the owner asks. Gaut. (18. 28-30 ) and Yāj. IIL 43 are to the same effect. Angiras 898 quoted in Gr. R. (p. 450) allows bogging to the diseased, the indi gent, to one who is torn away from his family and who is on a journey. Saṅkba-Likhita 899 as quoted in Gr.R. (p. 457) say when a man begs he should state the purpose (such as inarriage completion of sacrifice ) of his begging; he should not beg of a woman or of those who are minors or unable to conduct their affairs, nor when the donor is not in &amp; proper place or at &amp; proper time. He should apply the alms to the purpose for which he begged. He should give that portion of the alms wbich remains unused to priests or any other excellent person'. Vas. Dh. S. (III. 4 ) and Parāśara 300 ( I. 60) call upon the king to fine that village where persons of the higher classes wander about begg ing though they are not observers of vows (like brahmacārins ) and are not studying the Veda. The foregoing will show that indiscriminate begging was never allowed or encouraged by the smrtis even for brābmanas, much less for others.</p>
<p>It has been seen above how even during the Vedio period brāhmaṇas had come to be highly eulogised as if they were gods and held superior merely on account of birth. The</p>

Vide Sāntiparva 343, 13-14, Manu IV. 117, Likhita 31, Vas, Dh. 9. 30.2-5. The same ideas of the sacredness and the superiority of brāhmaṇas were carried forward and further emphasized by the dharma-śāstra works. Most exaggerated and hyperbolical descriptions of the greatness of brāhmaṇas are sown broadcast over all the smrtis and the purāṇas. It is not possible to set out even a small fraction of them. But a few passages may usefully be cited here by way of samples. The Visnu Dh. 8.301 (19, 20-22 ) says &lsquo;the gods are invisible deities, but brābmaṇas are visible deities; the worlds are supported by brāhmaṇas ; the gods stay in heaven by the favour of brābmanas; words spoken by brāhmaṇas never come to be untrue&rsquo;. Manu (I. 100) declares &lsquo;whatever 08 wealth exists on this earth-all that belongs to the brābmaṇa; the brāhmaṇa deserves everything on account of his superiority due to his descent (from the mouth of the Creator ).&rsquo; Manu IX. 313-321 contain a hyperbolical eulogy of the power of brābmaṇas, two of which may be set out &lsquo;who would prosper if he oppresses brāhmaṇas that, when angered, might oreate other worlds and other guardians of the worlds and that might deprive the deities of their position as deities&rsquo; ( 315 ); &lsquo;&amp; brāhmana, whether learned or not, is a great deity&rsquo; ( verse 317 ). Manu XI. 84 is &lsquo;a brābmana by the very fact of his birth is an objeot of honour even to the deities.&rsquo; Parāśara (VI. 52-53 ) holds' whatever defects there may be in vratas, in austerities, or in sacrificial rites, they all vanish when brāhmaṇas support them. Whatever words are spoken by brāhmaṇas are spoken by the gods ; brābmanas have all the gods in them and therefore their words do not fail. *803 The Mabābhārata indulges in very</p>

<p>frequent eulogies of brābmanas. Adiparva (28. 3-4) say 804</p>
<p>a brāhmaṇa, when provoked, becomes fire, the sun, poison, and weapon; a brābmana is declared to be the guru of all beings.' Vanaparva 305 ( 303. 16 ) says' a brābmana is the highest light, he is the highest tapas; the sun shines in heaven on account of the salutations made by the brāhmaṇas'. This and similar dicta closely follow what was expressed in the Vedio period long before e. g. &lsquo;the sun would not rise if the brāhmaṇa did not make sacrifice&rsquo; (Satapatha II. 3. 1.5); the refrain of Rg. II. 15. 2-9 is tbat Indra performed his great and heroic works under the intoxication of the soma ( offered by the priests in sacrifices ). Rg. IV. 50.7-9 say that a king and others for whom tbe purohita offers prayers win battles, secure booty and help from gods. Anuśāsana-parva08 (33. 17) says * they may make a non-deity into a deity and a deity into &amp; non-deity ; that man may become a king whom they desire to be so, and he who is not desired by them may be defeated.' Sānti ( 56. 22 ) declares. In this world brahmana is the highest being'.</p>
<p>It should not be supposed that the brāhmanas inserted these eulogies solely for the purpose of increasing their importance, and tightening their hold on the other classes. If the other classes had not themselves more or less shared these ideas, no amount of iteration on the part of brābmapas would have given them the influence which they as a matter of fact wielded. Their influence was a growth of centuries and they themselves were as much parts of the huge edifice of the caste system as the other varṇas. Besides the brāhmanas had no military force behind them. They could only succeed in influenoing the other varnas by persuasion and their own worth. The brāhmaṇas were the creators and custodians of the vast literature that bad grown up, they were the guardians of the culture of ages, they were expected to shoulder the burdens of teaching and preserving the vast literature on such gifts as were voluntarily made.

<p>Eulogy of brāhmanas</p>
<p>137</p>
<p>live up to the high ideals set up for their order, there must have been not a few who made as near an approach to the fulólment of the ideal as possible. It was the greatness of these latter that led to the glorification of the whole order to whicb they belonged. Learning and tapas are more or less elusive and impalpable, while birth from brāhmaṇa parents was quite an apparent and palpable thing. Therefore that was seized upon by some writers as the principal reason for the respect to be given to brāhmaṇas. For centuries human societies have everywhere acquiesced in the government and control exercised by small coteries of the elite, generally the elite of birth, who have guided the destinies of their societies on traditional lines of religious and social order. It must be remembered that the smrti works also extol the office of the king ( which was generally hereditary and is so even now ) to the skies. Manu ( VIL 4-11 ) propounds to the theory that the king has in him the parts of buoh gods as Indra and that a king is a great deity in human form. The theory of varṇas as conceived by Manu and other smrtikāras was based upon the idea of the division of labour, on the idea of balancing the rival claims of various sections of the community ; it laid greatest emphasis upon the duties of the varṇas rather than upon their rights and privileges. It raised the brāhmaṇa to the highest pinnacle of reverence, but at the same time it placed before him the ideal of not hankering after temporal power, of leading a life of compara tive poverty and of making his knowledge available to the other classes for a soanty and precarious return. It made the military caste feel that they were not all-in-all, but had to look up to some other class 88 superior to themselves. European writers severely condemn brāhmanas for their greed, selfishness and constant praises of gifts to themselves. But they forget to take account of the circumstances under which the brāhmaṇas were forced to sing the praises of gifts to them. The ideal before brāhmaṇas was to lead a life of comparative poverty; they were forbidden to follow many worldly pursuits and depended on the generosity of their patrong. They did not live in monasteries as Buddhist and Christian monks did nor were they entitled to fixed and fat salaries like the bishops in some Christian countries. They had further to bring up their own families and pupils and had themselves also to make gifts to others. In modern capitalist societies those who have brains</p>

<p>and knowledge tend to become financiers and capitalists, all wealth is ountred in their hands, they reduce most other men to mere wage-earners who are often hardly better than helots. While finding fault with the brāhmaṇa writers of over two thousand years ago for the eulogies they bestowed upon themselves, one should not forget that even in the 20th century when the pursuit of scientifio studies is professed to have reached its zenith, we hear ecstatio and arrogant eulogies of the white man&rsquo;s burden, of the great and glorious achievements of the Nordio race and the greater and more glorious future it is destined to attain ( vide the very first sentence in Spengler&rsquo;s *The Decline of the West', English translation by C. F. Atkinson). The brāhmaṇas never arrogated to themselves the authority to depose kings and to hand over vast territories for ever to whomsoever they liked, as Pope Alexander VI by his Bull of 1493 made over the New World to Isabella of Castille and Ferdinand of Aragon ( vide Dean Inge&rsquo;s &lsquo;Christian Ethics&rsquo; 1930 p. 160 where this astounding Bull is set out).</p>
<p>It has been seen already that brāhmaṇas had the special privileges of teaching, officiating as priests and accepting gifts made as a religious duty. It is desirable that a comprehensive list of all the privileges claimed by brāhmaṇas (though not always conceded as the sequel will show ) should be set out once for all.</p>
<p>(1) The brāhmaṇa was to be guru( object of reverence )388 to all verṇas by the mere fact of birth. Ap. Dh. 8. (1. 1. 1. 5) says 80. Vas. Dh. 8. (IV. 1 ) says ' the system of four varnas is distinguished by its origin and by the special features of the sacraments ( each of them undergoes )' and quotes Rg. X. 90.12 in support. Manu (1. 31 and 94 ) says that the Creator produced the four varnas respectively from his mouth, arms, thighs and feet, that (I. 93 ) the brāhmaṇa is by right the master of this whole world on acoount of his birth from the best limb(i.e. the mouth ) of the Creator, on account of his priority (in birth to the kṣatriya and others) and on account of possessing Vedic lore. Manu(X.3) uses almost the same words as Vasiṣtha&rsquo;the brābmaṇa is the master of the varnas on account of the peculiar excellence</p>

<p>(of his caste ), on account of his superiority of origin (from the mouth of the Creator ), on account of his submitting himself to discipline (or holding up Vedio lore) and on account of the eminence of the sacraments ( samgkāras ) in his case'. Bhisma. parva ( 121. 35 ) says that the brāhmaṇa is superior among all castes. This sense of superiority was carried so far that Ap&amp;m stamba 209 (1. 4. 14. 23), Manu (II. 135 ) and Viṣṇu Dh. S. (32. 17 ) say that a brāhmana only ten years old was to be honoured as a father by &amp; kṣatriya 100 years old.</p>
<p>(2) The brāhmaṇa was to expound the duties of all other classes, to indicate to them proper conduot and their means of livelihood and they were to abide by his directions and the king was to rule in accordance with such directions (Vax. Dh. S. I. 39-41, Manu VII. 37, X. 2). This is supported by the words of the Kathakasambitā 310 ( IX. 16 ) and the Tai. Br, that the brāhmana is indeed the supervisor over the people. The Ait. Br. (37.5) declares that where the might of kṣatriyas is under the control ( or direction) of brālmaṇas that kingdom becomes prosperous, that kingdom is full of heroes 311 &amp;o. This idea is somewhat similar to the teaching of Plato who held that philosophers that had undergone a special training were to rule and were to be politicians, that the government of the best (aristocracy ) was the ideal system. The problem is how to find out the best. Anoient India solved it by leaving the decision of knotty points to the learned brāhmaṇas and the execution of the decisions arrived at by them to the king and the kṣatriyas.</p>
<p>(3) The king was the ruler of all, except brāhmaṇas' Gautama 318 XI. 1. The Mit, on Yāj. II. 4 explains that these words were only laudatory of the greatness of brāhmaṇas and were not to be taken literally and that the king oould punish brāhmaṇas in appropriate cases. These words of Gautama are a mere echo of certain passages like those in the Vāj. 8. (IX. 40) and the Sat.318 Br. (V, 4.%. 3 and IX. 4. 3. 16 ), where it is said</p>

<p>*Som&amp; is the king of us brāhmaṇas'. The idea was that brāhmaṇas had to prepare some and offer it in sacrifices to the gods i.e, they held all wealth for Some and owed all allegiance to Soma, while other people owed allegiance only to the king. The brāhmaṇas alone were to eat the sacrificial food and drink Soma (and kṣatriyas were to drink only a substitute for Soma ). Vide Ait. Br. ( chap. 35 khanda 4). In the Mahābhārata, however, many kings are described as Somapas. So the practice of not allowing the kṣatriyas to drink soma was not universally accepted. Further it was probably not a privilege at all, but only indicates that Soma sacrifices had been mostly neglected by all except brāhmaṇas.</p>
<p>(4) &ldquo;The king should exonerate ( the brāhmaṇa ) in the six matters, viz. (a brāhmaṇa ) should not be beaten ( whipped ), he should not have fetters put on him, he should not be muloted in fines of money, he should not be driven out ( of the village or country), he should not be consured, he should not be abandoned' Gaut, VIII.&ldquo;14 12-13. The Mit, on Yāj. II. 4 explains that these words are not applicable to every brābmaṇa, but only to deeply learned brāhmaṇas described in the preceding sūtras (Gaut. VIII. 4-11). Haradatta adds that even a learned brāhmaṇa is treated in this way only if he commits an offence without pre-medi tation but only through ignorance or oversight. As to corporal punishment for brāhmaṇa offenders, the matter stands thus. Gaut XII.43 says that there is no corporal punishment for a brāhmana (even when he being a thief comes to the king confessing his guilt and asking the king to beat him with a heavy club on the head). Vide Manu XI, 99-100 also. Baud. Dh, S. (I 10. 18-19) first lays down that a brāhmana is to undergo no beating for any offence but allows for &amp; brāhmaṇa guilty of the mortal sins (of brāhmana-murder, incest, drinking liquor, theft of gold) the punishment of branding on the forehead with red. hot iron and banishment from the country. Manu IX. 237 (= Matsyapurāṇa 227. 163-164), Viṣnu Dh. 8, V. 4-7 prescribe the</p>

<p>Ch. Iti ) Brāhmana and corporal punishment 141 various figures that were to be branded on the forehead of a brāhmaṇa in the case of various offences. Manu (VIII. 379-380) presoribes shaving of the head for brāhmaṇa offenders where others would have had to suffer the extreme penalty of death and adds that a brāhmaṇa was not to be sentenced to death whatever offence he might have committed and that he is to be banished from the country taking with him all his possessions. Even on this the Mit. ( on Yāj. II. 81 ) observes that it applies only when it is the brāhmaṇa&rsquo;s first offence (i, e. he may be fined for repeating an offenoe). Yāj. ( II. 270 ), Nārada ( sābasa, Verse 10 ) and Saṅkba 314 prescribe branding and banishment as punishment for brābmanas ( particularly in the case of theft). The brābmana was never above being fined. Manu ( VIII. 123) prescribes fine and banishment for &amp; perjured brāhmaṇa witness, while Manu VIII. 378 presoribes heavy fines for &amp; brāhmana guilty of rape or adultery. The Mit, on 316 Yāj. II. 302 quotes &amp; verge of Manu ( not found in the extant Manusmrti) that in the case of the brāhmaṇa corporal punishment takes the form of complete shaving of the head, he is liable to banishment from the town, he may be branded on the forehead and he may be made to ride through the town on the back of an a88 ( looked upon at all times as the highest form of indignity ). Kaut. also 317 (IV.8) forbids corporal punishment for brāhmaṇas in all offences but prescribes branding on the forehead in the same way as Manu(IX.237) and also banishment and labour on minos. But Kaut makes an exception, viz. he allows a brāhmana to be drowned in water if he is guilty of high treason, or of forcible entry in the king&rsquo;s haren or of inciting the enemies of the king &amp;o. Katyāyana 318 ( quoted by Visvarūpa on Yāj. II. 281) proscribes death sentence even for a brāhmaṇa when the latter is guilty of the destruction of a foetus, of theft, of</p>

<p>striking a brāhmaṇa woman with a weapon and of killing an innocent woman. The Mit. on Yaj. III, 257 thinks it possible that kings sentenced brāhmaṇas to death in spite of the prohibi tion of corporal punishment and we have &amp; olassical illustra tion in the death sentence passed on the brāhmaṇa Carudatta by king Palaka in the Mṛcobakaṭika (IX). The foregoing discussion shows that the only special privilege claimed for the brābmaṇa in the law courts of the land was freedom from death sentence or other corporal punishment like whipping, though rarely he was liable to be sentenced to death also. He was subject to the indignities of branding and being paraded on the back of an ass, to fines and banishment. These claims were very muode rate as compared with the absurd lengths to which the doctrine of ' benefit of clergy&rsquo; was carried in England and other western countries.319 The olergyman in England was not by birth, he bad to be ordained. Yet clergymen claimed that an ordained clerk, a monk or nun charged with serious offences called felonies could be tried only by an ecclesiastical court and this was conceded by the ordinary courts; this privilege was gradually extended to persons not ordained viz. to doorkeepers, readers, exorcists (all of whom merely assisted the clergy ) and finally to all who could read or pretended to read a few words from the Bible. Holdsworth, Pollock and Maitland admit that the procedure in the ecolesiastical courts was little better than a farce (P and M vol. I. p. 426, Holdsworth vol. III p. 296 ), The ecclesiastic courts never pronounced &amp; judgment of blood, the bishop only deprived the offending clerk of orders, and relegated him to a monastery, or kept him in prison for life or a shorter period and very rarely whipping and branding were ordered. Even in the first quarter of the 20th century, European British subjects and Europeans and Americans in general could claim in British India some startling privileges when charged with orimi nal offonces which even the brāhmspas of over two thousand years ago did not claim. For example, under Sec. 443 of the Criminal Procedure Code of India ( as it existed before 1923 ) they could not be tried by any Indian Magistrate (however senior and experienced ) and that in serious Odses like murder, even a Sessions Judge who was himself an European British</p>

<p>subject could not sentenop an European British &lsquo;subjeot to more than one year&rsquo;s imprisonment (Section 449). Any European or American could claim to be tried by a mixed jury of which not less than one half had to be Europeans or Americans, while an Indian offender could not claim the privilege in his own country that not less than one half of the jury that tried him must be Indians. In England even now a peer indicted for treason or felony must be tried by his peers and not by the tribunals that try ordinary men (vide Halsbury&rsquo;s Laws of England, 2nd Ed. vol. 25 p. 46). The brāhmaṇas had to submit to trial in the ordinary courts and the smrtis do not generally provide for trial of brāhmaṇas in special eoclesias. tical courts of tbeir own class. The only approach to this western doctrine of benefit of clergy is to be found in the Ap. Dh. 8.,380 where it is said that the teacher and others who have authority over a brāhmana guilty of transgressions should presoribe prāyaścittas for him : if he does not abide by their orders, he should be taken to the king who should hand him over to his own purohita; the latter was to prescribe prāyas cittas ( penances for atonement) for brāhmaṇa offenders. If the latter did not carry out the penances then he was to break them by disciplines according to their ability except that he (the purohita ) was not to prescribe corporal punishment and slavery for brāhmaṇa offenders.</p>
<p>(5) Most smrtis lay down that a śrotriya (a brābmana learned in the Veda ) was to be free from taxes. Certain passages of the Sat. Br. suggest that even in those times brāhmanas were not taxed.381 Ap. Dh. 8.828 II. 10. 26. 10. Vas. Dh. 8. 19. 23, Manu VII, 133 say this. Some claimed this exemption for all brāhmaṇas e. 8. Vas. Db. S. ( I. 42-43 ) says &ldquo;a king ruling over his subjects according to the rules of the Sāstra should take the sixth part of all wealth except from brāhmaṇas&rdquo;; the Visnu Dh. 8.

<p>not recover taxes from brāhmaṇas&rsquo;. Kaut. *83 (II. 1) requires the king to make gifts of brahmadeya lands to Țtviks (who offioiate at solemn sacrifices), teachers, purobitas, śrotriyas, that will yield substantial produce and on which no fines and taxes will be levied. The reason assigned was the belief that the king shared in the religious merit accumulated by the brāhmanas. Vas. 884 (1. 44-46 ) explains ( freedom from taxation is there) because he (the king) secures the sixth part of the istā pārta ( the merit due to sacrifices and performing charitable works of public utility) and it is declared (in a Brāhmaṇa text) tbat the brābmana enriches the Veda, he relieves (others ) from calamities and therefore the brāhmana is not a source of subsistenoe (i. e, should not be taxed by the king ) since Soma is his king; and it is further declared that bliss awaits after death ( the king who does not tax brābmaṇas ).&rsquo; The Viṣnu Dh. S. III. 27 says &lsquo;they render unto him the tax of religious merit&rsquo;. Manu VII. 136 says ' by the religious merit which the śrotriya accumulates every day when protected by the king, the king&rsquo;s life, wealth and kingdom increase.' Vide Manu 8. 305. This sentiment is expressed even by &amp; great poet like Kalidasa 825 &lsquo;forest-dwellers give &amp; sixth part of their tapas ( merit due to austerities) to the king and that is an fnexhaustible treasure&rsquo;. It is further to be noted that not only grotriyas, but also many other persons were free from taxation. Ap. Dh. 8. (II. 10. 26. 11-17 ) exempts from taxation all woman of the four varṇas, all boys before they show signs of manhood (i. e. before they attain majority ), those who stay with their teachers for learning (even though they may be grown up), those engaged in susterities and devoted to right practices, a sūdra wbo washes the feet (of men of the three higher classes ), the blind, the dumb and the diseased, those who are for bidden to possess wealth ( i. e. Ascetics eto. ). The Vas. Db. S. ( 19. 23.) 388 exempts from taxation the king&rsquo;s servants, helpless</p>

<p>persong, ascetics, minors, senile men (above 70), young men, and women who are recently delivered. Manu VIII. 394 con tains a similar provision. Bṛhat-Parāśara 327 (chap. III, Jiv. part II p. 113 ) says ' a brāhmaṇa engaged in agriculture had to pay nothing to anybody. It is extremely doubtful whether in actual practice kings respected all these rules. Note 275 shows that a brāhmaṇa engaging in agriculture had to pay 3th of the produce just as others did. An inscription of Vikramā. dity.a V, found near Gadag dated sake 934 ( 1012 A. D.) refers to taxes levied even on upanayana, marriages and vedio sacri. fices ( E. I. vol. XX. pp. 64 and 70). The Santiparva ( 76. 2-10 ) contains an interesting disquisition on the taxation of brāhmaṇas. Those brāhmaṇas who have mastered all the lores and who treat all equally well are called brahmasama. Those brāhmaṇas who have studied the Rgveda, Yajurveda and Samaveda and who stick to the peculiar duties of their olass are styled devasama ( verses 2 and 3). A religious king should make those who are not śrotriyas and who do not kindle the sacred fires render taxes and forced labour ( verse 5). Then certain brāhmaṇas are described as kṣatrasama and vaiśyasama. A king whose treasury is empty should levy taxes from all brahmanas except those that are desoribed as brahmasama and devasama.326 Even if these rules were honoured, the claim was not very excessive. The brāhmaṇas who ministered to the religious wants of the people and wbo were to conserve the religious literature and spiritual inheritance of the country and to teach without the liberty to make &amp; contract for fees were never entitled to raise taxes from the people for their benefit. According to the practice of the Roman Catholic Churoh &lsquo;the clergy owed no allegiance to the Becular power; they were not under the laws of the land, they paid no taxes to the State. All benefices were put under the Holy See and the Roman chancery compiled &amp; tariff of prioes for which each might be bought&rsquo;. It would take too long to</p>

<p>(6) In the matter of treasure trove the brahmana was more favourably treated than members of other classes. If a treasure was found by a learned brāhmaṇa he was entitled to keep the whole of it; in other cases the treasure belonged to the king, except a sixth part which was given to the finder if he honestly informed the king about the finding of the treasure. If a king himself found buried treasure, he was to distribute half of it among brāhmaṇas and was to keep for himself the other half. Vide Gautama (X. 43-45 ), Vas Dh. S.

<p>(7) The general rule about the property of one dying heir less is that it escheats to the king, but there was an exception in the case of an heirless brāhmaṇa. Such property was to be distributed among śrotriyas or brābmanas. Vide Gautama 330 28. 39-40, Vas. Dh. S.17.84-87, Baud. Dh. S. I. 5. 118-122, Manu IX. 188-189, Visnu Dh. S. 17. 13-14, Saṅkha..]</p>
<p>(8) The rule of the road was in favour of brāhmaṇas even as against the king. If on a road there was a crowd or obstruc tion, precedence was to be given to the cartman, to a very old man, to one suffering from a disease, to a woman, to a snātaka, to the king; but &amp; king was to give precedence to a śrotriya-Gaut, VI. 21-22.

<p>Brahmana and precedence on a road</p>
<p>147</p>
<p>give precedence to fools, patita, the intoxicated and lunatics and a person of a lower varṇa should give precedenoe to one of a higher varpa. The Mahābhārata (Vanaparv: 133. 1 ) adds the blind and the deaf,(Anugāsana 104. 25-26 ) cows, &amp; pregnant woman and a weak man. Vas. Dh. S. (13,58-60) enumerates the same persons, but says that the snātaka ( one who has just returned from his stay with his guru ) has precedence over the king and that the bride has precedence over all when being taken in a procession ( to the house of the bridegroom ). Manu II. 138-139 has the same list and prefers the onātaka to the king; Yaj. I. 117 has the same rules. Saṅkha ( quoted in the Mit. on Yāj I. 117) mentions the view of some that the king has precedence over the brāhmaṇa, but disapproves of it. Vide Brahmapurana 113, 39 for a list. The Mārkandeyapurāṇa ( 34. 39-41) has a long list which includes a prostitute and one who is an enemy. The Viṣnu Dh. 8. ( V. 91) prescibes a fine of 25 kārśāpaṇas for him who does not give procedence on the road to one who deserves it. It will be conceded by every one that the above rules ( exoept the one about the precedence of brāhmaṇas over even the king ) are quite reasonable and are informed by a spirit of humanity and chivalry. The rule about learned brāhmaṇas probably owes its origin to the emphasis laid on the importance of the diffusion of learning ( which was not the direct concern of the state in those days, but of the brāhmaṇas ) and tbe superiority of knowledge over mere brute force or military achievements.</p>
<p>(9) The person of the brāhmaṇa was regarded as very sacred from ancient times and so brahmahatya ( killing a brahmana ) was looked upon as the greatest sin. The Tai. 8.3** (V. 3. 12, 1-2) says that he who performs the horse-sacrifice goes beyond (i. e. gets rid of) all sins, even the sin of brāhmana murder. The Tai. S. II. 5. 1. 1 narrates how Indra incurred the sin of brahmahatya by killing Viśyarūpe and how all beings ran him down as &lsquo;brahmahan&rsquo;. In the Sat. Br. XIII. 3. 1. 1 we read (8. B. E. vol. 44 p. 328 )&rsquo; thereby the gods redeem all sin, yea, even the slaying of a brāhmaṇa they thereby redeem and * whosoever kills a human brāhmaṇa here he forsooth is deemed guilty, how much more so who strikes him ( Soma), for Soma is god' (S. B, E. vol. 26 p. 243 ). The Ohandogya Up. V. 10.9 quotes</p>

<p>defence by One Manu IV. 16</p>
<p>of one&rsquo;s t</p>
<p>a verse declaring brāhmaṇa murder as one of the five mortal sins (mahāpātakas). Gaut. (21, 1) places the murderer of x brahmana at the head of his list of patitas ( persons guilty of mortal sins ). Vas. Dh. S. (I. 20 ) uses the word bhrūnahatyā.334 Manu XI. 54, Viṣnu Dh. S. 35. 1, Yāj. III. 227 enumerate five mahāpatakas of which brāhmana-murder is one. Manu VIII. 381 declares that there is no worse sin in the world than brāhmaṇa-murder.</p>
<p>A question that very much exercised the minds of all smrtikāras and writers of digestg335 was whether &amp; brāhmaṇa who was himself guilty of violence or serious offences could be killed in self-defence by one attacked. The diota of the smśtis are somewhat conflicting. Manu IV. 162 lays down a general rule prohibiting himsā ( death or injury ) of one&rsquo;s teacher (of Veda), expounder (of the meaning of the Veda ), one&rsquo;s parents, one&rsquo;s other teachers (or elders ), brāhmaṇas, cows and all persons engaged in austerities. Manu XI. 89 lays down that there is no expiation (prayasoitta) that will wipe off the sin of intentionally killing &amp; brāhmaṇa. But Manu himself (VIII. 350-351=Viṣṇu Dh. S. V. 189-190=Matsyapurāṇa 227. 115-117=Vṛddha-Hārita IX. 349-350) says &lsquo;one may surely kill without hesitation a man who comes down upon one as an ātatāyin338 ( a desperate character or violent man), whether he be a teacher, a child or an old man or a learned brāhmaṇa. In killing an atatāyin, the killer inours no sin ( or fault), whether he kills him in the presence of people or alone; (in such a case) wrath meets wrath&rsquo;: Vas. Dh. S. (III. 15-18) expressly says *by killing an ātatāyin they say the killer incurs no sin whatever' and quotes three verses &lsquo;an incendiary, &amp; poisoner, one armed with a weapon, a robber, one who wrests a field or carries away one&rsquo;s wife-these six are called atatāyin.

(1.1) says that bhrūpa is a brābmana learned in the Veda who has performed soma sacrifices. Vide noto 290 a bore.

<p>Killing a brāhmaṇa</p>
<p>149</p>
<p>an atatayin comós ( to attack) with the desire to kill (or harm), one may kill him even though he be a complete master of Vedānta; by 80 doing one does not become a brāhmaṇa murderer. If a person kills one who has studied the Veda and who is born of a good family, because the latter is an atatāyin, he does not thereby become a brāhmana-murderer as in that case fury meets fury.&rsquo; 337 In the Sāntiparva (34.17 and 19 1328 we have similar verses &ldquo;If a brāhmaṇa approaches wielding a weapon in a battle and desirous of killing &amp; person, the latter may kill him even if the former be a complete master of the Veda. If a person kills a brābmaṇa ātatāyin who has swerved from right conduct, he does not thereby &hellip; &hellip; &hellip;fury'. Udyog&amp; parya (178. 51-52 ) says that, if a man kills in a battle a brāhmaṇa who fights like a kṣatriya, it is a settled rule that he does not incur the sin of brābinana-murder. Santi (22.5-6) is to the same effect. The Viṣṇu Dh. S. (V. 191-192 ) speaks of seven persons as ātatāyin viz, one who has &amp; weapon ready to strike, .one who is about to set fire or administer poison, one who has raised bis hand to give &amp; curse, who sets about to kill by the magic rites mentioned in the Atharvaveda (e. g. such sūktas as I. 19, II. 19, III. 1-%, VII. 108 ), one who is a back. biter and informs the king, one who violates or assaults another&rsquo;s wife.' The Matsyapurānu (227. 117-119) is practically to the same effect. Sumantu as quoted by the Mit. (on Yaj. II. 21) and by Aparārka (p. 1043 ) &lsquo;says &lsquo;there is no sin in killing an ātatāyin except &amp; cow or a brāhmaṇa *.839 This implies that a brāhmaṇa even if an ātatayin should not be killed, but if he be killed sin is incurred. Kātyāyana340 ( quoted in the Sm. C. and other digests ) declares that one should not kill a brāhinana who is eminont by reason of his tapas, Vedio study and birth, even though he be an ātatāyin; Bhṛgu allows killing when the offender is of a lower caste than that of brābmana&rsquo;. Bphaspati841 also says that he who would not kill a brāhmana atatayin</p>

<p>deserving to be killed for his violence would obtain the merit of an Aśvamedha sacrifice.</p>
<p>Commentators and writers of digests differ in their interpre. tations. Visvarūpa 348 (on Yāj. III. 222) remarks that he is guilty of brābmana-murder who kills &amp; brāhmaṇa except in battle or except when the latter is an atatāyin, or who kills &amp; brābmana ( not an ātatāyin nor fighting ) on his own account without being employed by another or who brings about the death of such a brāhmana by hiring another to perpetrate the murder for money. He further adds that the man who kills &amp; brāhmana at the instigation of another for money is not guilty of the sin of brāhmaṇa-murder, but it is the instigator who is 80 guilty on the analogy of the rule that the merit or fruit of a sacrifice belongs to him on whose behalf the ștviks perform it. The Mit.343 on Yāj. (II. 21 ) says that the real purport of Manu VIII. 350-351 is not to ordain that a brāhmaṇa must be killed if he is an atatāyin, but those two verses are only an arthavāda ( laudatory or recommendatory diota ), the real meaning being that even &amp; guru and a brābmana who are most highly honoured and who are not fit to be killed at all, may have to be killed if ātatāgins (then what of others ?). The final conclusion of the Mit, is that if a brāhmana who is an ātatāyin is being opposed in self-defence without any desire to kill him and if he dies through mistake or inattention, then the killer inours no punishment at the band of the king and has to undergo a slight prāyascitta i. e. there is really &amp; prohibition to kill an atatayin brāhmaṇa and verses like Manu VIII. 351 refer to an ātatāyin who is not a brāhmaṇa. Medhātithi appears to have held the same view i on Manu VIII. 350-351). Kullūka explains Manu VIII. 330 as meaning that&rsquo;a guru or a brāhmaṇa or others coming as ātatāyins may be killed when it is impossible to save oneself even by fleeing from them&rsquo;. Aparārka is of opinion 344</p>

<p>Killing a brāhmana</p>
<p>151</p>
<p>that where an atatāyin brāhmaṇa cannot be prevented from his wioked intent except by killing him, there only the sastrag allow the killing of a brāhmaṇa but where it is possible to ward him off by a mere blow (i. e. without actually killing him ) there would be the sin of brāhmana-murder if he were actually killed. The Sm. O. in a long note appears to hold that an atatāyin brāhmaṇa rushing upon a man to kill him may be killed by the person attacked (there is no sin and no punishment nor penance for it), that a brāhmaṇa atatāyin ( who does not come to kill but) who only siezes one&rsquo;s fields or wife should not be killed (but lesser harm may be done to him with impunity ) and that kṣatriyas and others if atatāyin may be killed outright. The Vyavahāra-Mayūkha 345 adds a rider that, on account of the prescription contained in the section on kalivarjya (actions forbidden in the Kali age) viz. &lsquo;the killing in a properly conducted fight of brāhmaṇas that are ātatāyin&rsquo; ( is forbidden in Kali), an ātatāyin brāhmaṇa even when about to kill a person should not be killed by that person in the Kali age, that such a brāhmaṇa was allowed to be killed in former ages, that an ātatāyin brāhmaṇa other than one bent upon killing another was not be killed in all ages. The Viramitrodaya ( pp. 19-27 ) has a long disquisition on this subject but space forbids us from giving even a brief summary of it. It will have been noticed how the sacredness of the brāhmaṇa&rsquo;s person went on increasing in later ages.</p>
<p>(10) Even threatening &amp; brāhmans with assault, or striking him or drawing blood from his body drew the severest condemnation from very ancient times. The Tai.348 8. (II. 6. 10.1-2) oontains these words &lsquo;He who threatens a brāhmana should be fined a hundred, he who strikes a brāhmaṇa should be fined a thousand, he who draws blood would not reach ( or find ) the abode of pitrs for as many years as the dust particles that may be made into &amp; paste by the quantity of blood drawn. Therefore one should not threaten a brāhmans with assault, nor strike him nor draw his blood&rsquo;. Gaut. ( 22. 20-22) has a</p>

<p>similar 847 dictum, viz. that threatening a brāhmaṇa with assault in wrath prevents entry into heaven for a hundred years (or leads to hell for a hundred years) &amp;o. Jaimini III. 4. 17 considers the question whether the passage in the Tai. 8. is kvatvartha or puruṣārtha.</p>
<p>(11) For certain offences &amp; brāhmana received lesser punishment than members of other classes. For example, Gaut. says 848 * if a kṣatriya reviled a brāhmaṇg the fine was one hundred ( karṣāpaṇas ), if a vaisya did so it was 150 ; but if &amp; brāhmaṇa reviled a ksatriya the fine was 50; if he reviled a vaisya it was only 25, and if a brāhmaṇa reviled a sūdra he was not to be fined. Vide Manu VIII. 267-268 (but Manu pregoribes a fine of twelve for a brābmaṇa reviling a sūdra) which are the same as Nārada ( vākpāruṣya verses 15-16 ), Yāj. II. 206-207. But in the case of certain crimes the brāhmaṇa was to receive heavier punishment. For example, in the case of theft, if a gūdra thief was fined 349 eight, &amp; vaisya 16 and a kṣatriya 32, a brāhmaṇa was fined 64, 100 or 128. Vide Gaut. 21. 12-14 and Manu VIII. 337–338.</p>
<p>(12) According to Gaut. 350 ( XIII. 4 ) a brābmapa could not be cited as a witness by a litigant who was not a brāhmana and the king would not summon him, provided he ( the brāhmaṇa) was not an attesting witness on &amp; document. Narada ( rṇādāpa verse 158 ) lays down that 351 frotriyas, those engaged in austerities, old men, those who have become ascetics, are not to be witnesses because the authoritative texts 80 prescribe but there is no cause assigned for this rule.' So Nārada&rsquo;s view was that a srotriya could never be cited as a witness by any litigant (even by a brāhmaṇa litigant). Gaut. impliedly shows that even a srotriya could be oited as a wit ness by a brāhmaṇa. Manu VIII. 65, Viṣnu Db. S. VIII. 2 also forbid citing a srotriya as a witness.</p>

<p>Minor privileges of brāhmaṇas</p>
<p>153</p>
<p>(13) Only certain brāhmaṇas were to be invited for dinner in sraddhas and in rites for gods. Vide Gaut. 15. 5 and 9, Ap. Db. 8. II. 7. 17. 4, Manu III. 124 and 128, Yaj. I, 217, 219, 221.</p>
<p>(14) Oertain sacrifices could be performed only by brahmaṇas. For example, the Sautrāmani sacrifice and the sacrifices called sattras could be performed only by brāhmaṇas.383 But it has to be noted that the Rājasūya sacrifice could performed only by kṣatriyas and that according to Jaimini VI. 6. 24-26 even brāhmanas of Bhrgu, Sunaka and Vasistha gotras could not perform a sattra.</p>
<p>(15) The periods of mourning were less in the case of brābmaṇas. Gaut. 14. 1-4 prescribes ten days of mourning for brāhmaṇas, eleven for ksatriyas, twelve for vaisyas and a month for sūdras. Vas. Dh. S. IV. 27-30, Viṣnu Db, S. 22. 1-4, Manu V, 83, Yāj. III. 22 contain similar provisions. Later on ten days' mourning came to be presoribed for all oastes.353</p>
<p>Several other legger privileges are enumerated by Nārada (prakirṇaka, verses 35-39) &ldquo;The king shall show his face in the inorning before brābmanas first of all and shall salute them all. When nine or seven persons ( of different rank) meet, they shall first make room for the brāhmaṇa to pass 354 by. Further privileges assigned to brāhmanas are: free access to the houses of other people for the purpose of begging alms; the right to collect fuel, flowers, water and the like without its being regarded as a theft35s and to converse with other men&rsquo;s wives without being restrained ( in such conversation) by others; and the right to cross rivers without paying any fare for the ferry-boat and to be oonveyed ( to the other bank) before other people. When engaged in trading and using a ferry boat, they shall have to pay no toll. A brāhmaṇa who is engaged in travelling, who is tired and has</p>

<p>There were some disabilities also in the case of brāhmaṇas which have been indicated in the above discussion (viz. as to avocations, selling articles &amp;o.).</p>
<p>It may be convenient to bring together the disabilities of the sūdra :</p>
<p>(1) He was not allowed to study the Veda. Many of the smrtikāras and writers of digests856 quote several Vedio passages on this point. A śruti text reads &lsquo;(The Creator ) created the brāhmaṇa with Gayatri ( metre), the rājanya with Triṣtubh, the vaisya with Jagati, but he did not create the śūdra with any metre; therefore the sūdra is known to be unfit for the saṁskāra ( of upanayana)&rsquo;. The study of the Veda follows after Upanayana and the Veda speaks of the Upanayana of only three olasges387 one should perform upanayana for a brāhmaṇa in spring, for a rājanya in summer and in sarad (autumn) for a vaisya.' Not only was the sūdra not to study the Veda, but Veda study was not to be carried on in his presence ( vide note 75 above ).858 This attitude need not cause wonder. The sacred Vedio literature was largely created and preserved entirely by the brāhmaṇas ( the ksatriyas contributing if at all &amp; very small share in that task ). If the brāhmanas desired to keep their sacred treasure for the twice. born classes in these circumstances, it is understandable and for those ages even excusable. In the 20th century there are vast majorities who are not allowed by small minorities of imperial. istio and capitalistio tendencies to control the just and equitable distribution of the material goods produced mostly by the labour and co-operation of those majorities and doctrines are being openly professed that certain races alone should be imparted higher and scientific knowledge while other 80-called inferior races should be only hewers of wood and drawers of water.</p>

<p>There are however faint traces that in ancient times this prohibition of Veda study was not so absolute and universal as the smrtis make it. In the Chandogya Upaniṣad IV. 1-2, we have the story of Jānaśruti Pautrāyana and Raikya where the latter addresses Jānaśruti as sūdra and imparts to him the Samvarga ( absorption ) vidyā.359 It appears that Jānaśruti was a sūdra to whom the vidyā embodied in the Chāndogya ( which is also Veda ) was imparted. It is no doubt true that in the Vedāntasūtra 260 (I. 3. 34 ) the word sūdra is explained not as referring to the class, but as meaning that sorrow ( suc) arose in Jānasruti on hearing the contemptuous talk of the flamingoes about himself and he was overcome ( from dru) by that (i. 8. śūdra is derived from suc and dru). But this far-fetched explanation had to be given because of the practice current in the times of the Vedāntasūtras that the sūdra is not entitled to study the Veda. Gaut. XII. 4 went so far as to presoribe' if the sūdra intentionally listens for committing to memory the Veda, then his ears should be filled with ( molten ) lead and lao; if he utters the Veda, then his tongue may be cut off ; If he has mastered the Veda his body should be hacked' 361,</p>
<p>Though the sūdra could not study the Veda, he was not debarred from hearing the itibāsas (like the Mahābhārata ) and the Purāṇas. The 362 Mababbārata (Santi 328. 49 ) expressly says that the four yarṇas should hear the Mahābhārata through &amp; brāhmaṇa as reader. The Bhagavatapurāṇa 263 says that as the three Vedas cannot be learnt by women, sūdras and brāhmaṇas ( who are so only by birth ), the sage ( Vyasa ) composed the story of the Bhārata out of compassion for them. The Sūdraka malakara 284 ( pp. 13-14 ) cites several passages from the purāṇas</p>

<p>to the effect that the sūdra could not study the smrtis and purānas by himself. Even Manu II. 16 seems to suggest that only the dvijātis had the privilege to listen to the Manusmṛti (and not sūdras ). The only privilege conceded by the Sūdrakamalakara to the sūdra is that he can acquire knowledge by listening to the purānas read by a brāhmaṇa (p. 17); the Kalpataru and other works allowed the sūdra to read and repeat Purāṇa mantras. Samkarācārya on Vedāntasūtra ( I. 3, 38 ) quotes śānti 328. 49 and says that the sūdra has no adhikūra ( eligibility ) for brā hmavidyā based upon a study of the Veda, but that a sūdra can attain spiritual development (just as Vidura and Dharma vyadha mentioned in the Mabābhārata did ) and that he may attain to mokṣa, the fruit of correct knowledge. In certain digests we find &amp; smrti quotation to the effect that sūdras are Vājaga neying. This is 365 explained as meaning that the sūdra should follow the procedure prescribed in the gļhyasūtra of the Vājas&amp; neya Sākbā and a brābmapa should repeat the mantra for him. This is probably based on the Harivamsa (Bhavisyat-parva, chap. III. 13 ) &ldquo;all will expound brahma ; all will be Vājasane yins; when the yuga comes to a close sūdras will make use of the word &lsquo;bhob&rsquo; in address&rdquo; (sarve brahma vadisyanti sarve</p>
<p>Vājasaneyinaḥ).</p>
<p>(2) The sūdras were not to consecrate sacred fires and to perform the solemn Vedic sacrifices. Vide note 73 above. Jaimini ( 1.3, 25-38 ) elaborately discusses this question and arrives at the conclusion that the sūdra oannot consecrate the three sacred fires and so cannot perform Vedic rites. Among the reasons given are that in several Vedio passages only the three higher classes are referred to in the case of the consecration of fires, about the samans to be sung, about the food to be taken when obgerving vrata.366 It is however interesting to note that at least one ancient teacher ( Bādari ) 367 was found wbo advocated that</p>

<p>Sudras not authorized for Vedic rites</p>

<p>even sūdras could perform Vedio sacrifices. The Bhāradvaja Srauta sūtra 868 (V.2.8) states the opinion of some that the sūdra can consecrate the three sacred Vedic fires. The Kātyāyana. srautasūtra ( I. 4, 5 ) prescribes that all can perform Vedic rites except those who are deficient in a limb, who are not learned in the 389 Veda, who are impotent and sūdras; but the commentary thereon states by way of pūrvapakṣa that there are certain Vedic texts which lead to the inference that the Sūdra had the adhikāra for Vedic rites e. g. in Sat. Br. I. 1. 4. 12 ( S. B. E. vol. XII. p. 28 ) it is said with reference to the Haviṣkpt call &ldquo;Now there are four different forms of this call, viz. Come hither' (ehi) in the case of a brāhmana ; &lsquo;approach&rsquo; (agahi) and * hasten hither'(ādrava) in the case of a vaisya and a member of the military gaste and &lsquo;run hither&rsquo; (adhāva ) in that of a $ūdra.&rdquo; Similarly in the Somayāga in place of the payovrata (vow to drink milk only ) masłu ( whey ) is prescribed for sūdra (indicating thereby that the sūdra could perform Somayāga) and in Sat. Br. (XIII 8. 3. 11, S. B. E, vol. 44, p. 435 ) with reference to sepulchral mounds it is said ' for the kṣatriya he may make as high as a man with upstretched arms, for a brābmana reaching up to the mouth, for a woman up to the hips, for a vaisya up to the thighs, for a sūdra up to the knee. The commentary on the Katyayana Srauta I. 1.6 says that the word gūdra here stands for rathakāra because ( aoc, to Yāj, I. 91 ) his mother&rsquo;s mother is a sūdra woman.</p>
<p>Though the sūdra was not authorized to perform Vedio rites, he was entitled to perform what is called pārta-dharma 390 i. e. the building of wells, tanks, temples, parks and distribution of food as works of charity and gifts on such occasions as eclipses and the Sun&rsquo;s passage from one zodiacal sign into another and on the 12th and other tithis. He was allowed to perform the five daily sacrifices called Mahāyajñas</p>

<p>in the ordinary fire, he could perform sraddha, he was to think of the devatās and utter loudly the word &lsquo;namah&rsquo; which was to be the only mantra in his case (i. e. he was not to say *Agnage svāha' but to think of Agni and say 171 &lsquo;namah&rsquo;). Manu X 127 prescribes that all religious rites for the sūdra are without (Vedic ) mantras. According to some the sūdra could also have what is called Vaivāhika fire ( i. e. are kindled at the time of marriage) in Manu III 67 and Yāj. I. 97, but Medhātithi (on the same verse), the Mit. (on Yaj. I. 121 ), the Madanapārijata (p. 231 ) and other works say that he should offer oblations in the ordinary fire and that there is no Vaivabika fire for the sūdra. All persons including the sūdras and even cāndalas were authorized to repeat the Ramamantra of 13 letters ( Sri Rama jaya Rama jaya jaya Rāma) and the Siva mantra of five letters (namaḥ śivāya ), while dvijatis could repeat the Siva mantra of six letters (Om namaḥ śivāya). Vide Śūdra-kamalakarą pp. 30-31, where passages of Varāba, Vamana and Bhavisya Purāṇas are cited to show that sūdras are entitled to learn and repeat mantras of Vispu from the Pañcarātra texta and of Siva, the Sun, Sakti and Vināyaka. The Varāhapurāṇa (128. 22-31) describes the initiation ( dikṣā ) of a sūdra as a devotee of Viṣnu ( as a bhāgavata ).</p>
<p>(3) As to Sanskaras, there is some apparent confliot among the authorities. Manu X. 126 says &ldquo;The gūdra incurs no sin (by eating forbidden articles like onions and garlio ), he is not fit for saṁskāras, he has no adhikāra for (authority to perform ) dharma nor is ha forbidden from performing dharma and in IV.80 (which is the same as Vas. Dh. 8. 18. 14 and Viṣnu Dh. S. 71. 48-52) we see one should not give advice to a sūdra, nor give him leavings of food nor of sacrificial oblations, one</p>

<p>should not impart religious instruction to him nor ask him to perform vratas'. Laghuviṣṇu 87% (I. 15 ) contains the dictum that the sūdra is devoid of any samskāra. The Mit. on Yāj. IIL 262 explains the words of Manu IV. 80 about vratas in the case of sūdras as applicable only to those sūdras who are not in attendanoe upon members of the three higher castes and esta blishes that sūdras can perform vratas ( but without home and muttering of mantras ). Aparārka on the same verse ( Manu IV. 80 ) explains that the sūdra cannot perform vratas in person, but only through the medium of a brāhmana. The Sūdra kamelākara (p. 38) holds that sūdras are entitled to perform vratas, fasts, mahādānas and prāyaścittas, but without homa and japa. Manu X. 127 allows religious śūdras to perform all religious sots which dvijātis perform, provided they do not use Vedio mantras. On the other hand Saṅkha (as quoted by Viśvarūpa on Yāj. I. 13 ) opines that samskaras may be performed for sūdras but without Vedio mantras. Yama quoted in Sm. C. (I. p. 14) says the same. Veda-Vyasa (I. 17) prescribes that ten samskāras ( viz. garbhādhina, pumsavana, slmantonnayana, jātakarma, namakarana, niṣkramana, anne prāśana, oaula, karṇavedha and vivāha ) can be performed in the case of sūdras, but without Vedio mantras. Haradatta ( on Gautama X. 51 ) quotes a gļhyakāra to the effect that even in the case of the sūdra the rites of niṣeka, pumgavana, simanton nayana, jātakarma, nāmakarana, annaprāśana and caula are allowed but without Vedio mantras. When Manu prescribes (IL. 32 ) that the sūdra should be given a name conneoted with service, he indicates that the sūdra could perform the ceremony of nāmakarana. So when Manu ( IV. 80 ) states that he deserves no samskāra, what he means is that no samskāra with Vedio mantras was to be performed in his case. Medbātithi on Manu IV. 80 says that the prohibition to give advice and impart instruction in dharma applies only when these are done for making one&rsquo;s livelihood, but if a śūdra is a friend of the family of a brāhmaṇa friendly advice or instruction oan be given. Vide Sudrakamalakara p. 47 for several views about the samskāras allowed to sūdras.</p>

<p>higher castes, Gaut.873 ( XII. 1-%) prescribed the cutting off of his penis and forefeiture of all his property and if he was guilty of this offence when entrusted with the duty of pro tecting her, he was to suffer death in addition Vaṣ. Dh. S. 21.1. Manu VIII. 366 prescribe death in the case of a sūdra having intercourse with a brāhmana woman whether she was willing or unwilling. On the other hand, if a brāhmaṇa committed rape on a brāhmaṇa woman he was fined a thousand and five hundred if he was guilty of adultery with her (Manu VIII. 378) and if a brāhmaṇa bad intercourse with a kṣatriya, vaisya or sūdra woman, who was not guarded, he was fined five hundred (Manu VIII. 385 ). Similarly in the case of Vākpārusya (slander and libel) if a sūdra reviled a brāhmaṇa he received corporal punishment or his tongue was cut off (Manu VIII. 270), but if a ksatriya or vaiśya did so they were respectively fined 100 or 150 (Manu VIII. 267 ) and if a brāhmana reviled a sūdra, the brābmand was fined only 12 (Manu VIII. 268 ) or nothing (aco. to Gaut. XII. 10). In the case of theft, how. ever, the sūdra was fined much less. Vide above p. 152 (No. 11 among the privileges of brāhmaṇas).</p>
<p>(5) In the matter of the period for impurity on death or birth the sūdra was held to be impure for a month, while a brāhmana had to observe ten days' period only. Vide above p. 153 (No. 15 among the privileges of brābmaṇas ).</p>
<p>(6) A gūdra could not be a judge or propound what dharma was. Manu (VIII. 9) and Yāj. I. 3 lay down that when the king does not himself look into the litigation of people owing to pressure of other business, he should appoint a learned brābmaṇa as a judge. Manu (VIII. 20) further says that a king may appoint as his judge even a brahmana who is 80 by birth only (i. e. who does not perform the peculiar duties of brāhmaṇas ), but never a sūdra.

<p>in *** the Mit, on Yaj. I. 3 ) says that when a brahmana is not available (as a judge ) the king may appoint as judge a kṣatriya or a vaidya who is proficient in dharmaśāstra, but he should carefully avoid appointing a śūdra as judge.</p>
<p>(7) A brahmana was not allowed to receive gifts from &amp; Śūdra except under great restrictions. Vide above note 239.</p>
<p>(8) A brāhmaṇa could take875 food at the houses of mem bers of the three classes who performed the duties prescribed for them by the sāstras ( according to Gaut.), but he could not take food from a sūdra except when the sūdra was his own cowherd, or tilled his field or was a hereditary friend of the family, or his own barber or his daba. Vide Gaut. XVII. 6 and Manu IV. 253 (=Viṣnu Dh. S. 57. 16), Yaj. I. 166, Parāśara IX. 19. Ap. Dh. S. I. 5. 16. 22 saya 876 ' that food which is brought by an impure śūdra should not be eaten by a brāhmana;' but Āpastamba allows śūdras to be cooks in brāhmaṇa households provided they were supervised by a member of the three higher classes and observed certain hygienio rules about paring nails, the outting of hair. Manu IV. 211 forbade in general the food of a sūdra to a brahmana and by IV. 223 he laid down that a learned brābmaṇa should not take cooked food from a sūdra who did not perform śraddha and other daily rites ( mahāyajñas ) but that he may take from such a sūdra uncooked grain for one night, if he oannot get food from anywhere else. Baud. Dh. S. (IL. 2. 1) requires a brāhmaṇa to avoid the food of vrsalas ( śūdras ). Gradually rules about taking food from sūdras became stricter. The Saṅkhasmfti ( 13. 4) remarks that brāhmaṇas fattened on the food given by sūdras are Panktidūṣaka. Parāśara 377 XI. 13 ordains that a brāhmaṇa may take from a sūdra ghee, oil, milk, molasses and food fried in oil or ghee, but should eat it on &amp; river bank and not in the sūdra&rsquo;s house and the Par, M. adds</p>

<p>(II. 1. pp. 411-12) that this permission is meant to apply only when the brāhmaṇa is tired by travelling and no food from a momber of another class is available. Haradatta on Gaut. XVII. 6 remarks that a brāhmaṇa could take food from a sūdra who was a cowherd &amp;o. only in the case of very extreme cala mities. Aparārka algo (p. 244 on Yāj. I. 168 ) says the same. In the kalivariya ( actions forbidden in the kali age) the old practice of eating the food of cowherds, barber &amp;c. was for bidden, 878</p>
<p>(9) The sūdra gradually came to be so much looked down upon that he could not touch a brahmana, though at one time he could be a cook in a brāhmaṇa household and a brāb mapa could eat food from his house. In the Anuśāsa naparva (59.33 ) it is said 379 &lsquo;a brāhmaṇa should be served by a sūdra from &amp; distance like blazing fire while he may be waited upon by a kṣatriya or vaisya after touching him.&rsquo; Aparārka (p. 1196 ) quotes two smrti texts &lsquo;&amp; brāhmaṇa on touching a sūdra or niṣada becomes pure by acamana ( ceremo nial sipping of water); on touching persons lower than these, he becomes pure by bathing, prāṇāyāma and the strength of tapas; on seeing a ram, &amp; cock, a crow, a dog, a śūdra and an antyāvasāyin (an antyaja ), one should stop the rite that is being performed and on touching them one should take a bath&rsquo;. On this Aparārka explains that if a man who touched &amp; sūdra cannot bathe then he may resort to sipping water, but if able he must take a bath or that on touching &amp; sat-sūdra one may have recourse to acamana and on touching an asateśūdra one must take a bath. We find from the Gșhyasūtras 380 that in Madhuparka offered to a snātaka the feet of the guest (even if he was a brahmana ) were washed by a sūdra male or female. So there could have been no ban against a sūdra touching a brāhmaṇa then. The Ap. Dh. S. (II. 3. 6.9-10) says that two sūdras should wash the feet of a guest, according to some teachers (in the case of a householder who has several disas ), while Apastamba</p>

<p>himself says that one gūdra should wash the guest&rsquo;s feet and another should sprinkle him with water.341</p>
<p>(10) As the sūdrs could not be initiated into Vedio study, the only aśrama out of the four that he was entitled to was that of the householder. In the Anuśāsanaparva ( 165. 10) we read 88&rsquo;I am a sūdra and so I have no right to resort to the four asramas'. In the Santiparva383 ( 63. 12-14 ) it is said, ' in the case of a sūdra who performs service (of the higher olasses ), who has done his duty, who has raised offspring. who has only &amp; short span of life left or is reduced to the 10th stage (i. e. is above 90 years of age ), the fruits of all asramas are laid down ( as obtained by him ) except of the fourth.' Medha tithi on Menu VI. 97 explains these words 88 meaning that the sūdra by serving brahmanas and prooroating offspring as a house-holder acquires the merit of all aśramas except mokṣa wbloh is the reward of the proper observance of the duties of the fourth aśrama,</p>
<p>(11) The life of a sūdra was esteemed rather low. Yāj. III. 236 and Manu XI. 66 include the killiog of a woman, a sūdra, a vaisya and a kṣatriya among upapātakas; but the prāyasoittas and gifts prescribed for killing these show that the life of the sūdra was not worth much. On killing a kṣatriya, the prāyasoitta prescribed was brahmacarya for six years, gift of 1000 cows and a bull; for killing &amp; vaisya, brahmacarya for three years and gift of 100 cows and a bull; for killing &amp; gūdra brahmacarya for one year, gift of 10 cows and a bull. Gaut. XXII. 14-16, Manu XI, 126-130, Yāj III. 266-267 say practically the same thing. Ap. Db. S.( I. 9. 25. 14-1. 9. 26. 1) says that on killing a crow, a chameleon, a peacock, a cakravāka, flamingo, bhāsa, a frog, ichneumon, muskurat, a dog, a cow and draught ox the prāyaścitta is the same as that for killing a sūdra. Manu (XI. 131 ) says &lsquo;on killing a cat, an iobneumon,</p>

<p>If the sūdra laboured under certain grave disabilities, he had certain compensating advantages. He could follow almost any profession except the few specially reserved for brāhmaṇas and kṣatriyas. Even as to the latter many gūdras became kings and Kaut, in his Arthaśāstra (IX. %) speaks of armies of sūdras ( vide note 266 above). The sūdra was free from the round of countless daily rites. He was compelled to undergo no saṁskāra (except marriage), he could indulge in any kind of food and drink wine, he had to undergo no penances for lapses from the rules of the śāstras, he had to observe no restrictions of gotra and pravara in marriage. Those western writers who turn up their nose at the position of the sūdras in ancient and medieval India conveniently forget what atrocious crimes were perpetrated by their people in the institution of slavery and in their dealings with the Red Indians and other backward coloured races; how nations of Europe out of false pride of race have passed in the 20th century laws prohibiting marriages between the so-called Aryans and non-Aryans and preventing the latter from holding state offices and carrying on several occupations and how discrimination is made against coloured men on railways, in hotels and other places of public resort and how even in India separate third class compartments were reserved on railways for Europeans, for entering which Indians were prosecuted and sentenced in their own country.

<p>CHAPTER IV</p>
<p>UNTOUCHABILITY</p>
<p>Those who have written on the Indian caste system bave always been struck by the fact of the existence of certain castes that are treated as untouchables. But it should not be supposed that this is something confined only to India. Even nations that have no caste system at all have often carried out complete segregation of certain people dwelling in their midst, which in essentials is the same as the system of untouchability in India. The Encyclopaedia of social sciences vol. XI. p. 339 says that in the southern States of U. S. A. discrimination against Negroes took the form of residential segregation, separation of the races in public conveyances and places of amusement, exclusion of Negroes from public institutions and educational discrimination. Disenfranchisement and social discrimination had their economio counterpart in all branches of industry except agriculture and domestic and personal service,88% occupations to which Negroes had been habituated under the slave regime.&rsquo; It is also within living memory that Mahatma Gandhi had to lead a movement of satyagraha in South Africa against the disoriminating treatment of Indians and even now in Natal and other parts of British Africa there is legislation restricting Indians in the matter of residence and purchagos of land.</p>
<p>In the early Vedio literature several of the names of oastes that are spoken of in the emptis es antyajas occur. We have carmamna (a tanner of hides ?) in the Rgveda (VIII. 5, 38), the Capdala and Paulkasa occur in the Vaj. S., the Vapa or Vapta ( barber ) even in the Rg., the Vidalakara or Bidalakāra ( corresponding to the buruda of the smśtis) oocurs in the Vaj. 8. and the Tai.

<p>indioation in these passages whether these, even if they formed castes, were at all untouchables. The utmost that can be said is that as the Paulkasa is assigned to bibhatsā (in Vaj. S. 30. 17) and Candala to Vāyu (in the Puruṣamedha), the Paulkasa lived in such a way as to cause disgust and the Candala lived in the wind ( i. e. probably in the open or in a cemetery ). The only passage of Vedio literature on which reliance can be placed for some definite statement about cāndalas is in the Chandogya Up.386 V. 10.7. where while describing the fate of those souls that went to the world of the moon for enjoying the rewards of some of their actions it is stated those who did praiseworthy actions here, quickly acquire birth in a good condition, viz. in the condition of a brāhmaṇa, a kṣatriya or vaisya, while those whose actions were low ( reprehensible ) quickly acquire birth in a low condition i. e. as a dog, or a boar or &amp; capdala.' This occurs in Pañcāgnividyā, the purpose of which is to teach vairāgya and disgust with the transmigratory world. This passage does not enjoin anything, it is a bare statement by way of explanation or elucidation. All that can be legitimately ipferred from this is that the first three varṇas were cominended and that caṇdalas were looked upon as the lowest in the social scale. It is to be noticed that the sūdra vārng does not occur in this passage at all. So probably even in the times of the Chandogya the candāla was looked upon as a sūdra, though lowest among the several sūdra subcastes. The candala is equated with the dog and the boar in this passage, but this leads hardly anywhere. It is no doubt stated in the Sat. Br. XII. 4. 1. 4 387 that &lsquo;three beasts are unclean in relation to a sacrifice viz. the vicious (filthy) boar, the ram and the dog.&rsquo; Here it is clear that every boar is not unclean, but probably only that variety that subsists on the village offal. On the other hand the flesh of boars was said to cause great delight to the Pitps when offered in sraddha (vide Menu III. 270 and Yāj. I. 259). Therefore this Upaniṣad passage does not say anything on the point whether the Candala was in its day untouchable. This passage may be com pared with another in which the śūdra is said to be a walking</p>

<p>cemetery. If the sūdra was not untouchable in the Vedio literature, and if he was allowed to be a cook for brāhmaṇas and to wash the feet of brāhmaṇa guests in spite of that passage ( as stated in the Dharmasutras quoted above pp. 161-162 ), there is no reason to suppose that the Chandogya passage indicates that the candāla was untouchable in the remote ages. Another passage is relied upon by orthodox writers to support the theory that untouchability of candālas is declared in Vedio writings. In the Br. Up. I. 3 the story is narrated that gods and asuras had a strife and the gods thought that they might rise superior to the asuras by the Udgitha. In this vidya occurs the passage388</p>
<p>this devata ( Prana) throwing aside the sin that was death to these devatās (vāk eto. ) sent it to the ends of these quarters and he put down the sin of these devatās there; therefore one should not go to people (outside the Āryan pale) nor to the ends ( of the quarters ) thinking otherwise I may fall in with pāpman i. e. death'. In the first place there are no peoples expressly named here. Samkara explains that by &lsquo;end of the quarters are meant regions where people opposed to Vedic culture dwell. This description can only apply to people like the mleochas and not to cāṇdalas who are not opposed to Vedio knowledge (but who have no adhikāra to learn it). Besides cindalas might stay outside the village, but they do not stay at the end of the quarters:89 (or at the end of the arya territory ). Hence this passage does not help in establishing the theory of untouchability for Vedio times.</p>
<p>Next comes the consideration of the evidence derived from the sūtras and smrtis. But certain preliminary observations must be made to olarify the position. The theory of the early emptis was that there were only four yarpas and there was no fifth varna. Vide Manu X. 4 and Apusāganaparva 47.18.390 When in modern times the so-called untouchables are referred</p>

<p>to as the pañcamas,89l that is something against the smrti tradi tion. Pān, II. 4. 10 and Patañjali398 say that &amp; Samahara dvandva oompound can be formed from several subdivisions of sūdras that are not nirarasita e. g. we can have the compound *takṣayaskaram' meaning carpenters and blacksmiths, but not &lsquo;candala-mṛtapam&rsquo;, because capdalas and mrtapas&rsquo;are niravasita sūdras (and so the compound will be &lsquo;caṇdālamstapaḥ). There fore it follows that Pan. and Patañjali inoluded caṇdalas and mṛtapas among sūdras. When Angiras ( note 171 above) includes kṣats, sūta, vaidehika, māgadha and dyogava ( that are pratiloma castes) among antyāvasāyins along with cāndala and svapaca, he makes it clear that he regarded cāndalas as included among sūdras, for Manu X. 41 deolares that all pratiloma castes are similar to śūdras in their dharma and because the Santiparva 297,28393 expressly says that the vaidehika is called sūdra by learned dvijas. Gradually how. ever, a distinction was made between sūdras and castes like capdalas. Fresh castes were then added to the list of untoucha. bles by custom and usage and the spirit of exclusiveness, though there is no warrant of the sāstras for such a procedure.</p>
<p>Untouchability did not and does not arise by birth alone. It arises in various ways. In the first place, persons become outcasted and untouchable by being guilty of certain acts that amount to grave sins. For example, Manu IX. 235-239 presori bes that those who are guilty of brahmana-murder, theft of brāhmapa&rsquo;s gold or drinkers of spirituous liquors should be excommunicated, no one should dine with them or teach them, or officiate as priests for them, nor should marriage relationship be entered into with them and they should wander over the world excluded from all Vedio dharmas. But if they perform the proper priyasoitta they are restored to caste and become touchable. Secondly, persons were treated as untouchables simply through religious hatred and abhorrence beobuse they belonged to a different sect or religion. For example, Aparārka</p>

Fifthly, certain races such as mleochas and persons from certain countries and the countries themselves were regarded as impure ( vide notes 40, 42, 49).

<p>by Aparārka p. 1196 says &lsquo;on touching a fisherman, a deer-bunter, a hunter, a butcher, a bird-oatoher, and a washerman one must first bathe and then take one&rsquo;s meal&rsquo;. It is to be remarked that such texts do not expressly make a man of those castes untouchable even if he does not pursue the occupation stated, but they have rather the occupation in view. Such oooupations were thought impure, as it was believed that if one was to secure the final goal of liberation, one must oultivate purity of mind as well as body, and as great importance came to be attached to cleanliness and the ceremonial purity of the body for spiritual purposes ; and emphasis was laid upon not coming in contact with persons carrying on filthy or impure pursuits, but also with animals and even inanimate objects. These restrictions were not inspired by any hardness of heart or any racial or caste pride as is often said, but they were due to psychological or religious views and the requirements of hygiene. Āp. Dh. S. L 5. 15. 16 says&rsquo; a person touched by a dog should take a bath with his clothes on'. Vide also Vas. Dh. S. 23, 33, Viṣnu Dh. 8. 22. 69. Vžddha-Harita (chap. 11. 99-102) enumerates certain vegetables and herbs (such as leek) and other articles on touobing which one was to bathe. Ap. Dh. S. (II. 4. 9. 5) requires every house-holder to give food after Vai vadeva to all including cāṇdalas, dogs and crows. And this practice is followed even now by those who perform Vaiśvadeva. The anoient Hindus had &amp; horror of uncleanliness and they desired to segregate those who followed unclean professions like those of sweepers, workers in hide, tanners, guardians of cemeteries &amp;o. This segregation cannot be said to have been quite unjus tifiable. Besides those who are not familiar with anoient or even modern Hindu notions must be warned against being carried away by the horror naturally felt at first sight when certain classes are treated as untouchable. The underlying notions of untouchability are religious and ceremonial purity and impurity. A man&rsquo;s nearest and dearest women relatives such as his own mother and wife or daughter are untouchable to him during their monthly periods. To him the most affectionate friend is untouchable for several days when the latter is in mourning due to death in the latter&rsquo;s family. A person cannot touch his own son ( whose thread ceremony has been performed ) at the time of taking meals. In this latter cage there is no idea of impurity and in most of these cases there is no idea of superiority or inferiority. As many professions and · qrafts were in ancient times hereditary, gradually the idea arose</p>
<p>Oh. IVI</p>
<p>Untouchability</p>
<p>171</p>
<p>that a man who belonged to a caste pursuing certain filthy or abhorred avocations or crafts was by birth untouchable. Medie val and modern usage had no doubt reached the stage that if &amp; man belonged by birth to a caste deemed by custom to be untou obable he remained an untouchable whatever profession or craft he may pursue or even if he pursued no profession. But ancient and medieval writers thought otherwise and there was also great divergence of view as to who were untouchables and to what ex tent. The only caste that is said by the most ancient Dharma sūtras to be untouchable by birth is that of cāṇdālas and the word cāṇdala has a technical meaning in these works as stated above (p. 81 ) under cīṇdāla, Gaut. (IV. 15 and 23 ) says that the oān. dāla is the offspring of a sūdra from a brāhmaṇa woman and that he is the most reprehensible among the pratilomas. Āp. Dh.S. II, 1. 2. 8-9 388 states that on touching a cāndāla one should plunge into water, on talking to him one should converse with a brāh mana ( for purification ), on seeing him one should look at the luminaries ( either the Sun or moon or stars ). We have seen above that there were three kinds of candālas and they were all 80 by virtue of the circumstances of their birth. Manu ( X. 36, 51 ) makes only the andhra, meda, ciṇdāla and øvepaca stay outside the village and makes the antyāvasāyin (X. 39 ) stay in a cemetery. That leads to the inference that other men even of the lowest castes could stay in the village itself. Harita 399 quoted by A parārka (p. 279 ) states &ldquo;if a dvijāti&rsquo;s limb other than the head is touched by a dyer, a shoemaker, a hunter, a fisherman, a washerman, a butcher, a dancer (nata ), a man of sotor caste, oilman, vintner, hangman, village cock or dog, he becomes pure by washing that particular limb and by sipping water (i. e. he need not bathe)'. Here most of the Boven antyajas are included and it is expressly said that their touch is not so impure as to require a bath. Angiras (verse 17 ) states that a dvija when he comes in contact with a washerman, a shoemaker, a dancer (nata ), &amp; fisher man or a worker in bamboo becomes pure by merely acamana (by</p>

<p>sipping water ). The Nityacārapaddhati (p. 130 ) quotes a Verse *00 to the effect that even on coming in contact with cāndalas and pukkasas one need not bathe, if the latter stand near a temple of Viṣnu and have come for the worship of Viṣnu. Alberuni in his work on India (tr. by Sacbau vol. I. chap. IX ) refers to two classes of antyajas, the first of which bad eight guilds ( seven of which were practically the same as the seven in note 170 above, the eighth being the weaver) and a second group of four viz, Hadi, Doma, Cbandala and Bhadatau. As to the first group he says that they intermarried except the fuller, shoemaker and weaver. Alberuni seems to have been misinformed as to this and what caste he means by Bhadatau is not clear. Medhatithi 401 in his commentary on Manu X. 13 is positive that the only pratiloma who is untouchable is the cāndala and no bath is necessary on coming in contaot with the other pratilomas ( viz sūta, māgadha, dyogava, vaidebika and kṣat; ). Kullūka also says the same. Therefore it follows that in spite of the smști texts ( notes 170, 171, 173 ) inoluding the pre tilomas among antyajas along with the oāṇdālas, such authorita tive and comparatively early commentators as Medhatithi (about 900 A, D.) were firmly of opinion that they were not untouchable, Manu 408 V, 85 and Angiras 152 prescribe a bath for coming in bodily contact with a divākirti (a cāndala ), udakya (a woman in her monthly period ), patita (one outoasted for sin &amp;o. ), sūtikā (&amp; woman after delivery ), a corpse, one who has touched &amp; corpse. It follows therefore that the only antyaja who was asp?sya according to Manu was the cāṇdāla. But gradually the spirit of exclusiveness and ideas of ritual purity were carried to extremes and more and more castes became untouchable. Some Very orthodox writers of emptis went so far as to hold that on touching even a sūdra a dvijati had to bathe.*03 Among the</p>

<p>Untouchability</p>
<p>173</p>
<p>earliest occurrences of the word asprøya ( as meaning untouch ables in general) is that in Viṣnu Dh. S. V, 104; Katydyana also uses the word in that sense *04. It will have been seen from the quotations above that cāndālas, mlecchan and Pārasikas are placed on the same level as regards being asprsya. Atri tos ( 267-269) says ' if a dvijs comes in contact with a cāndala, patita, mleocha, a vessel containing intoxicating drink, a woman in her monthly course, he should not take his meals (without first bathing ) and if he comes in contact with these while taking his meal, he should stop, throw away the food and bathe', Vide Viṣnu Dh. 8. 22. 76 about talking with mlecchas and ośndalas. But so far as mlecohus are concerned these restrictions of untouchability have been given up long ago at least in public. Similarly the washerman, the worker in bamboo, the fisherman, the nata, among the seven well-known antyajas, are no longer untouchable in several provinces (though not in all ) and were not so even in the times of Medhatithi and Kullūka.</p>
<p>Once the spirit of exclusiveness and exaggerated notions of ceremonial purity got the upper hand they were carried to extremes. It does not appear from the ancient smrtis that the shadow of even the cāndāla was deemed to be polluting. Manu V. 133 (which is nearly the same as Vispu Dh. $. 23.52 ) declares &lsquo;flies, spray from &amp; reservoir, the shadow ( of a man ), the cow, the horso, the sun&rsquo;s rays, dust, the earth, the wind and fire should be regarded as pure.&rsquo; Yāj. I. 193 is a similar verge (Mārk. Purāna 35. 21 is almost the same ). Manu IV. 130 prescribes that one should not knowingly cross the shadow of the image of a deity, of one&rsquo;s guru, of the king, of a anataka, of one&rsquo;s teacher, of a brown cow or of a man who has been initiated for &amp; Vedic sacrifice. Here no reference is made to the shadow of a cāṇdala. Medhātithi on Manu V. 133 expressly says that *shadow means &lsquo;shadow of &amp; capdala and the like&rsquo;. Kullūka, however, adds on Manu IV. 130 that on account of the word * oa ' in that verse the shadow of oāṇdalas was inoluded in the injunction of that verse. Therefore it is legitimate to infer that Manu and Yaj. did not prescribe that even the shadow of</p>

<p>a cāndala was impure and caused pollution. Not only 80, Aparārka 400 quotes a verse the shadow of a caṇdala or patita, if it falls on a man, is not impure'. But Aparārka himself 109 adds on this verse the comment that this favourable rule about the shadow of a cāṇdala or patita is applicable only if he is at &amp; greater distance from a man than the length of a cow&rsquo;s tail. Bana in his Kādambari ( para 8) describes how the cāndāls girl entered the royal assembly-hall though she was untoucha ble and stood at some distance froin the king. It appears that there was no difficulty about her entering the hall of audience or polluting the assembly by her shadow. Gradually some smptis prescribed &amp; bath for a brābmana coming under the shadow of a cīṇdāla. The Mit. on Yāj. III. 30 quotes a verse of Vyāghrapāda that if a cāṇdāla or patita comes nearer to &amp; person than the length of a cow&rsquo;s tail, then the latter must take a bath and another verse of Bphaspati to the effect</p>
<p>a patita, a woman in her monthly period, a woman freshly delivered and a cāṇdāla should be kept respectively at a distance of one yuga, two, three and four'. As yuga is four cubits, this means that a capdāla cannot approach within 16 oubits of a caste Hindu, 408</p>
<p>As regards publio roads Vāj. I. 194 says that they become pure by the rays of the sun and the moon and by the wind even when they are trodden by cāṇdālas. In Yāj. I. 197 it is stated that the mud and water on public roads and on houses built of baked bricks, though touched by capdalas, dogs and crows, are rendered pure by the mere blowing of the wind over them.409</p>

<p>Untouchability</p>
<p>175</p>
<p>These rules show that the emptis followed a reasonable rule about the public roads and do not countenance the restrictions maintained in some parts of South India, particularly in Malabar, about the use of publio roads by the untouchables viz. that an untouchable must not approach within a certain distance of a high caste Hindu, must leave the road to allow him passage or must shout to give warning of his presence in order to avoid pollution to the easte Hindu. Vide Wilson&rsquo;s &lsquo;Indian Castes&rsquo; vol. II p.74 (footnote ) for details of the distance. In South India also there are various grades of distances within which members of the several lowest castes cannot approach high caste Hindus.</p>
<p>Certain provisions were made in the smrtis by way of exceptions to the general rules about the untouchability of certain castes. Atri *o (verse 249 ) says there is no taint of untouchability when &amp; person is touched by an untouchable in a templo, religious processions and marriages, in sacrifices, and in all festivals'. Sātātapa quoted in the Sm. O. declares that there is no doṣa ( lapse ) in touching (untouchables ) in a village (1. o. on the publio road), or in a religious procession or in an affray and the like, and also when the whole village is involved in a calamity.&ldquo;1 Bphaspati also remarks that there is no fault (and so no prāyasoitta) if one comes in contact ( with untouch ables ) at &amp; sacred place, in marriage processions and religious processions, in battle, when the country is invaded, or when the town or village is on fire. The Sm. O. adds that these verses were veriously interpreted; some saying that they apply only where one does not know that the man who has touched him is an untouchable, while others bold that they apply to the touch of impure persons who are not uochista (i. e, risen from meals without washing their hands &amp;o).

<p>(p. 79) summarises the places where no blame in incurred on the ground of mixing with untouchables viz. in battle, on publio roads leading to a market, in religious processions, in temples, in festivals, in sacrifices, at sacred places, in calamities or invasions of the country or village, on the banks of large sheets of water, in the presence of great persons, when there is &amp; sudden fire or other great calamity. It is somewhat remarkable that the Smṛtyarthasāra speaks of untouchables entering temples. The Par. M. (vol. II part I p. 115 ) says that there is no doṣa when cāndalas take water from a large tank (used by higher castes ), but as regards small reservoirs the same rules apply to them that apply to the purification of wells touched by untouchables. 413 Vide Vĩddha-Harita IX. 405-406 for the purification of a well.</p>
<p>The Viṣnu Dh. S. (V. 104 )&quot;}4 prescribed that if an untou chable deliberately touched a man of the three higher castes he should be punished with beating, while Yāj. II. 234 proscribes that if a cāpdāla ( deliberately ) touches any one of the higher castes the cāndala should be fined one hundred panas.</p>
<p>Elaborate rules are laid down about the penanoe for drink ing from the wells or vessels of untouchables, for partaking of their food (either cooked or uncooked), for staying with them and for having sexual intercourse with untouchable women, These matters will be briefly dealt with under prayascitta.</p>
<p>The so-called untouchables were not entirely excluded from worship. When it is said (as in Yaj. I. 93 or Gaut. IV, 20 )415 that the cāndalo is outside all dharma, the meaning is that he is outside such Vedic rites as upanayana, not that he cannot worship the Hindu deities nor that he is not bound by the moral code. He could worship images of the avatāras of Viṣnu ( vide note 364 above). The Nirnayasindhu quotes a passage of the Devipurāṇa that expressly authorizes antyajas to establish &amp; temple of Bhairava.

<p>antyāvasāying are purified by listening to the praises or names of Hari, by repeating the names of Hari and by contemplation on Him, much more therefore will those ( be purified) who can see or touob your images'. This however shows that to the author of the Bhagavata it never occurred that an untouchable could see or touch the image of Visṇu enshrined in a temple of caste Hindus. In south India among the famous Vaiṣpava saints called Aļvāre, Tiruppāṇa Alvār was a member of the depressed classes and Nammālvār was a Vellala. The Mit. on Yaj. III. 262 remarks that the pratiloma castes (which include oāṇdāla) have the right to perform vratas.417</p>
<p>In modern times the eradication of the system of untoucha bility is engaging the minds of great leaders like Mahatma Gandhi whose fast for 21 days for effecting a change of heart among caste Hindus is famous throughout the world. The prinoi. pal matters of concern to the so-called untouchables or depressed classes are facility for education in schools, removal of restrictions about places of public resort such as publio wells, roads, restaurants and eating houses and entry in public temples. A good deal has been done by a few zealous workers from anong the higher castes in these respects. The Christian missionaries have been doing good work among the untouchables, but their efforts are mainly devoted to direot or Indireot proselytization. The conscience of the educated among the higber castes has been roused. But the total removal of un. touchability is yet a matter of the distant future. The greatest draw-back is illiteracy among the masses of India. Hardly twelve per cent of the population are literate. The diffusion of literacy and the spread of the idea of the equality of all men before the law and in publio are the only sure solvents of the evils associated with untouchability which have exis tod for ages. Popular Governments in the provinces are doing what they with their limited resources can do to ameliorate the condition of the untouchables. The Government of India Act ( of 1935 ) has given special representation to the Scheduled Castes (the name given to the depressed classes or untouchables ) in the Provincial and Federal Legislatures of India.

<p>gets out the names of the numerous scheduled castes in the several provinces of British India. The Provincial Govern ments have issued circulars to enforce the rule that no discrimination be made against the scheduled castes in places of public resort and have tackled to some extent the question of the entry of untouchables in temples by passing such acts as the Bombay Act XI of 1938 viz. Bombay Harijan Temple Worship ( Removal of disabilities Act) and the Madras Temple Entry Authorisation and Indemnity Act of 1939. Much will depend upon the untouchables themselves. As am ong the caste Hindus, the untouchables also have inter se numerous divisions and subdivisions each of which regards itself as superior to several others of them and will not condescend to mix with them in the public or dine with them. They must also throw up from among themselves selfless and capablo leaders. This is a vast problem and the appalling evils which have been growing for ages can not be wholly removed in a day. The leaders of the so-called untouchables also should not make exaggerated claims. For the present they should rest content with equality in public places, public services and before the law and at the most entry into publio temples. But if they indulge in the tall talk of destroying the caste system at one stroke and requiring that all caste Hindus should dine with them and inter-marry with them, they may find that at least two hundred millions of caste Hindus will be dead opposed to them, and the cause of the removal of the evils of untouchability is bound to suffer a set-back. Besides it should not be forgotten that the amelioration of the condition of untouchables is bound up with the problem of the poverty of the entire rural population of India. It should not be supposed that all the untouchables are the poorest of the poor. I know from personal knowledge that many among certain classes of untouohables like the Mahars and Chambhars of the Decoan are economically better off than the ordinary cultivators in many villages. The mahars are hereditary village servants in the Deccan and they recover from every householder bread every day as part of their remuneration or a certain measure of corn from the threshing floor. Vide Grant Duff&rsquo;s History of the Marathas' (ed. of 1863 vol. I p. 23 ) for the balutedars ( village servants) among whom the mahar ocoupies an important place and Hereditary Offices Act ( Bombay Act III of 1874, section 18) for Legislative recognition of their ancient rights. The population of untou chables in India has been estimated at various figures from three</p>

<p>orores to six orores. The Simon Commission Report (1930) vol. I p. 40 estimated that there were about 43 millions of untoucha. bles in the whole of India, the criterion adopted being whether pollution by touch or approach within a certain distance is caused. The ratio of untouchables to the total population of India or to the Hindu population varies greatly in different parts of India. The total Harijan ( the name given to untouchables by Mahatma Gandhi) population is 14 per cent of the whole population of India. In the Bombay Presidenoy the ratio of Harijans to Hindus is only about eleven per cent being the lowest of all provinces and States in India, while in Bengal the ratio is about 32 per cent which is the highest in India except in Assam.*18 The High Courts in India have held that the untouchables are included among sūdras for purposes of marriage.

<p>CHAPTER V</p>
<p>SLAVERY</p>
<p>Slavery has existed as a constant element in the social and economioal life of all nations of antiquity such as Babylon, Egypt, Greece, Rome and also of many nations of Europe. &ldquo;20 It was however left to such Christian Dations of the West as England and the United States of America to carry on the institution of slavery in the most horrible manner possible never dreamt of by any nation of antiquity, viz. by sending out kidnapping expeditions to Africa to collect slaves, to huddle them in ships in such unspeakably filthy conditions that half of them died on the voyage, to sell them to plantation owners and others like chattel. Westermarck in his Origin and Development of the moral ideas' vol. I (1912) p. 711 was constrained to observe This system of slavery, which at least in the British colonies and slave states surpassed in cruelty the slavery of any pagan country ancient and modern, was not only recognised by Christian Governments but was supported by the large bulk of the clergy, Catholic and Protestant alike.' Slavery was abolished in the British Dominions only in 1833 and in British India by Act V of 1843.</p>
<p>It has been seen above (pp. 26-27) that the word &lsquo;dāsa&rsquo; in the Rg. generally stands for the opponents of the dryas. It is possible that when the dāsas were vanquished in battle and taken prisoners they were treated as slaves. In the Rgveda, however, there are not many passages where the word dasa' can be said to have been used in the sense of slave. In Rg VIII. 56. 3 421 we</p>

<p>read thou madest a gift to me of one hundred donkeys, of one hundred fleece-bearing ewes and one hundred dāsas'. It appears that here daga means slaves or serfs. In Rg VIII. 5.38 the sage praises his patron Caidya Kasu &lsquo;the common people sit down at the feet of Caidys Kaśu like men crowding round tanners of hides, (Caidya ) who honoured me by giving me ten noblemen that were like gold in appearance&rsquo;. Here probably there is an allusion to the gift of ten captured nobles made to the sage by Caidya Kaśu, the victor. A sage declares in Rg. VIII. 19. 36 *Trasadasyu, son of Purukutsa, gave me fifty young women', This probably refers to the gift of female slaves ( dagla). The Tai. S. VII. 5. 10. 1 says &ldquo;dāsis ( girl slaves ) place on their heads jars full of water and singing this madhu and beating their feet against the ground dance round the mārjāliya' &amp;o.428 The Tai. S. II. 2. 6. 3. refers to the gift of a horse or a male (slave ). &lsquo;He obtains a portion of himself who accepts ( in gift) a being with two rows of teeth, ( suoh as ) a horse or a human male; on accepting an animal with two rows of teeth one should offer to Vaiśvānara a mess cooked on twelve potsherds * 428 The Ait. Br. 39.8 mentions large gifts such as 10,000 girls (dāsi) and 10,000 elephants made by a king to his purohita performing coronation. When the angel of Death tries to dissuado Naoiketas from his curiosity to know the destiny of a person after death, he tempts the inquirer ( Katha Up. I. 1.25). Here are such handsome women with chariots and musical instruments as cannot be secured ( ordinarily ) by men; make them, when gifted by me, serve you; do not ask me what happens after death&rsquo;. The women referred to were probably meant to be serving (or slave ) girls who attended on a man as maids and who could dance and sing. In the Bṭ. Up. IV. 4. 23 Janaka after receiving instruotion in Brahmavidyā from Yajñavalkya exclaims' I make a gift to your honour of the Videhas together with myself for being your slavo'. We read in the Chan. Up. * In this world they speak of cows and horses, elephants and gold, wives and slaves, fields and houses as mahimā (greatness).</p>

<p>Vide also Chan, Up. V. 13.2 and Bf. Up. VI. 2.7 for references to dasis. These passages show that in the Vedio period men and women had become the subjects of gifts and so were in the condition of slaves.</p>
<p>Though Manu ordained (I. 91, VIII. 413, 414 ) that the principal duty of the sūdra was to wait upon the three higher castes or that the gūdra was created by the Creator for the service of brāhmaṇas, the sūdra who thus served a dvijāti ag &amp; duty was not his slave. Jaimini (VL 7. 6 )424 makes this perfectly clear by saying that when a man makes &amp; gift in the Visvajit sacrifica of everything belonging to himself he cannot make a gift of the sūdra who waits upon him as his duty. Sabara in his bhagya adds the sūdra may not desire to serve the man to whom the sacrificer gives his all and the latter has no power over him if he is unwilling.'</p>
<p>We have seen how the Gșhya Sūtras speak of dāsas being employed to wash the feet of honoured guests. It appears that the ideal placed before the masters was to treat the slave humanely. Ap. Dh. 8. II. 4. 9. 11485 says that opo may indeed stint oneself, one&rsquo;s wife or son (as to food) if guests come, but never &amp; dāsa who does one&rsquo;s menial work (or &amp; dāsa and hired servants). In the Anuśāsana parva*26 it is stated &lsquo;one should not sell a human being who is a stranger; how much more one&rsquo;s own children&rsquo;. In the Mahabhārata gifts of dāsas and dasis are very frequently men tioned. In Sabhāparva 52, 45, Vanaparv: 233, 43 and Virāts 18. 21 gifts of 30 dāsis to each of 88000 snātaka brāhmaṇas are spokon of. In Vanaparva 185. 34 Vainya is said to bave given a thousand handsome dāsis with ornaments on to Atri. Vide Dronaparya 57.5-9. Manu (VIII. 299-300) places a slave on the same level as one&rsquo;s son in the matter of corporal punish ment' the wife, the son, the slave, &amp; menial servant, one&rsquo;s full brother&ndash;these when guilty of wrong may be beaten with a rope</p>

<p>or a thin piece of split bamboo, but only on the baok and never on the head and if a person beat them otherwise he would be punished as a thief.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Slavery was probably not much 487 in evidence in India in the 4th century B. O, or the treatment of slaves in India was 80 good that a foreign observer like Megasthenes acoustomed to the treatment of slaves in Greece thought that there was no slavery. Megasthenes ( MacCrindle, p. 71 ) states that none of the Indians employs slaves ( vide Strabo XV. 1. 54). That slavery existed then admits of no doubt. The Emperor Asoka when proclaiming his Law of Piety enjoins in his 9th Rock Edict that the Law of Piety consists ( among other things ) in the kind (or proper) treatment of slaves (dāsas ) and hired servants. In the Arthaśāstra (III. 13 ) Kautilya *28 gives very important provisions about slaves. He says that the mleochas are not punishable if they sell or plenge their children, but an Arya cannot be reduced to slavery. He then prescribes that if a relative sells or pledges a sūdra ( who is not born as a slave ) or &amp; vaisya or ksatriya or a brāhmaṇa (all being minors), he should be respectively fined 12, 24, 36 and 48 paṇas and that if &amp; stranger sells or pledges the above then the vendor, the vendee and the abettors will be liable to the first, middle and highest ammercements and whipping respectively (i. e, first emmerce ment for sale of a sūdra by a stranger and whipping for the sale of a brahmana). But he allows the pledge of even an arya in family distress. He refers to several kinds of slaves viz. dhvajāhsta (captured in battle ), atmavikrayin (who sells himself), udaradāsa (or garbhadāsa, one who is born to a dāsi from a slave ) or those so made for a debt (abitika ), or for a fine or court&rsquo;s deoree (daṇdapranita ). He then prescribes how they are set free from slavery. One who sells himself or is pledged or is born a slave becomes a free man by paying off respectively the amount for which he was purchased or pledged or what would be a proper price. One who is made a slave for a fine may pay off the fine by doing work. One captured in war may become free by paying socor ding to the time he has been in bondage and the work he did or by paying half of it. The child of one who sells himself</p>

<p>History of Dharmasastra i Ch. remains an arya ( free man). He prescribes that if a master makes a pledged slave carry a corpse or - sweep ordure, urine or leavings of food, or keeps him naked, beats him or abuses him or violates the ohastity of a female slave, he forfeits the price paid by him. He presoribes the first ammorcoment for a master having intercourse with a pledged slave girl against her will and middle ammorcement for a stranger doing so.</p>
<p>Manu (VIII. 415 ) speaks of seven kinds of dāgas, viz. one captured in battle, one who becomes so for food ( i. e, in scarcity or in a famine), one born in the house ( i. e. of a female slave ), one bought, one given ( by his parents or relatives ), one inheri. ted ( as part of the patrimony), one who becomes so for paying off a fine or judicial decree. He states the general rule 428 that the wife, the son and the slave bave no wealth and whatever they earn belongs to him whose wife, son or slave they are. Manu prescribes a fine of 600 panas for a brāhmaṇa making a member of the dvijāti castes after his upanayana a slave against his will.</p>
<p>Nārada (abhyupetyāsusrūṣa ) and Kātyāyana among the smrtikāras contain the most elaborate treatment on slavery, Nārada first says that &amp; susrūṣaka (one who serves another ) is of five kinds viz. a Vedic student, an antavāgin (an apprentice who is learning a craft), adhikarmakst (a supervisor over workmen), bhṛtaka (hired servant) and dāsa. The first four are called karmakara. They can be called upon to do only work that is pure, while &amp; dāse may have to do impure work *20 Buch as cleaning the entrances to the house, filthy pits (for leavings of food), the road, dunghill heaps, touching (or soratohing ) private parts, taking up and throwing away ordure and urine (verses 6-7), doing bodily service to the master if he so desires, Nārada mentions 15 kinds of slaves viz. one born in the house, one bought, one acquired (by gift or other means ),</p>

<p>one inherited, one saved in a time of famine, one pledged by the master, one discharged from a large debt, one cap. tured in a battle, one vanquished in a bet, one who &amp;ocepts slavery by saying &lsquo;I am yours&rsquo;, an apostate from the order of asceticism, one who stipulates to be a slave (for &amp; certain time ), one who is a slave for food ( as long as food is given to him), one who is tempted to become a slave out of love for a female slave, and one who sells himself. Nārada says that the first four of these are not freed from slavery except by the favour of the master( v. 29 ), while one who sells himself is the worst kind of slave and he also does not become free from slavery (v. 37). Nārada ( v. 30) and Yāj. (II. 182 ) state a rule applicable to all slaves, viz. that when a slave saves a master from imminent danger to the latter&rsquo;s life the slave becomes a free man and (Nārada adds ) that he gets &amp; share in the inheritance as a son. One who is an apostate from the order of ascetics is a slavs of the king till the former&rsquo;s death ( Yaj. II. 183). One saved in a famine becomes free by giving a pair of cows, one pledgedo?! if the master who pledged him repays the debt, the slave in lieu of discharge of debt by paying off the debt with interest, one who accepted slavery or who was captured in battle or became so under a bet is freed by giving a substitute who is equal to him in work, one for a stipulated period by the lapse of the period, one who is a bhakta-dāsa becomes free by the master ceasing to give food, one who is &lsquo;vadavābśta ' ( tempted by a female slave ) by abandoning his intercourse with her ( Nārada vy. 31-34, 36 ). Yaj. ( II. 182 ) and Nārada (V. 38 ) say that one who was made a slave by force or was carried away by raiders and sold should be set free by the king. Yāj. (II. 183 ) and Nārada ( . 39) prescribe that a man can be a slave to a master only in the proper order of varṇas*** i. e, the three vargas next to a brāhmaṇa may be slaves to a brāhmaṇa, a vaisya or &amp; sūdra may be a slave to a kṣatriya but a kṣatriya cannot be the slave of a vaiśya or a śūdra, nor a vaisya of a śūdra. There is one exoeption viz. an apostate from asoeticism muy be the slave of a vajśya or a sūdra</p>

<p>king. Katyāyana emphasizes that a brāhmaṇa188 cannot be made a slave even to a brāhmaṇa, but if he himself chooses, he may do pure work for a brāhmaṇa endowed with character and Vodic learning, but no impure work. Katyāyana ( v. 721 ) says that when a brāhmaṇa becomes an apostate from the order of asceticism he should be banished from the kingdom and the kṣatriya or vaisya apostate may become a slave to the king. Dakṣa (VII. 33 ) quoted by Aparārka (p. 787) adds that the apostate&rsquo;s head should be branded with the mark of dog&rsquo;s foot.</p>
<p>Kautilya 84 and Katyāyana (v. 723 ) both declare that if a master has sexual intercourse with a female slave and she is delivered of a child, both the slave and the child should be given freedom by the master.</p>
<p>Kautilya declared that the heirs to the wealth of a slave are his relatives and if none of them exist then the master, while Katyāyana*85 says that the only wealth that the slave can call his own is the price he received for selling himself or what the master gave as a gift through favour.</p>
<p>Nārada (vv. 42-43 ) describes the ceremony of the manu mission of a slave &ldquo;when a master being pleased with a slave desires to make him &amp; free man, he should take, from the slave&rsquo;s shoulder, a jar full of water and break it, he should sprinkle water mixed with whole grains of rice and flowers on the slave&rsquo;s head and thrice uttering the words &lsquo;you are no longer a slave&rsquo; he should dismiss him with the ( slave&rsquo;s ) face to the east.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Vyavahāramayūkhu *38 quotes a verse from the Kalikāpurana about an adopted son, which is very interesting</p>
<p>• persons adopted and the like on whom the samskārag of cūda ( tonsure ) and Upanayans are performed by the gotra of the adopter, become sons of ( the adopter ), otherwise the person on whom such ceremonies are not performed ) is held to be a slave</p>

<p>( of the adopter ).&rsquo; The Vyavahāramayūkha remarks that this pagsage is not reliable as it is not found in several msø, of the Kalikapurāṇa. Narada mentions 15 kinds of slaves, but this is not one of them. All that the Kalikāpurāpa probably means is that when a boy is adopted into another family after his oūda and upanayana are performed in the family of birth, he is not fully affiliated in the family of adoption, he does not become a son and so does not take the inheritance but is only entitled to maintenance in the family of adoption, just as a slave is to be fed. No digests have recognised such a person as a slave proper.</p>
<p>Nārada 37 (ṣṇādāna 12 ) and Katyāyana declare that a debt contracted by a Vedio pupil, an apprentice, a slave, the wife, a menial gervant and a workman for the benefit of the family even though it was inourred in his absenoe, was bind. ing on the owner of the house. Ordinarily a slave was not &amp; competent witness, but Manu VIII. 70 and Uśanas ( quoted in Vyavahāramayūkha p. 37 ) say that when no other witness is available, a minor, an old man, a woman, a pupil, a relative, a slave or a hired servant may be a witness.</p>
<p>There are numerous works dealing with slavery in its various aspects. The latest book on the subject is &lsquo;Slavery through the ages&rsquo; by Sir George Mao Munn (1939). Mr. D, R. Banaji has published a very painstaking and interesting study on &lsquo;Slavery in British India&rsquo; from 1772 to 1843 (2nd ed. 1937) The Carnegie Institution of Washington has published studies on several aspects such as ' Judicial Cases' (by Mrs. Catterall in 1926 ) and &lsquo;Doouments of the history of the Slave Trade to America, 1930&rsquo; by Prof. Elizabeth Donnan. Dr. H. J. Nieboer&rsquo;s * Slavery as an Industrial System' (1910) is a well documented study of slavery in various countries and at various times.</p>

<p>SAMSKĀRAS</p>
<p>Gautama ( II. 1) says that before upanayapa, a boy may act, speak and eat as and what he likes (i. e. may follow his inclinations). Haradatta explains that this does not mean that he can kill a brāhmana or drink liquor, but that there is no restriction, although he be a brāhmana&rsquo;s son, to his selling what is forbidden to a brābmana to sell, or he may eat onions and garlic or stale food or may eat four or five times a day. Ap. Dh. S. +38 (II. 1. 6. 15. 17-20 ) states several views on this point. &lsquo;Up to the time when they begin to take cooked food infants do not become impure ( by the touch of a rajasvala &amp;o. ); according to some ( teachers ) up till they are one year old ; or till they are not able to distinguish the cardinal points; another view is that till upanayang ( they do not become impure ). Aparārka (p. 28 ) also explains that a boy may ( before upa nayana) eat the leavings of the food of his parents, but he cannot eat or drink what would cause loss of caste as in that case he may become unfit to have the samskāra of upanayana performed on him. The Sinrtyarthasāra gives the view of some that in case an infant touches &amp; cāndāla before it reaches the age of taking cooked food, only water need be sprinkled on it, before caula ācamana need be done by it and after caula (and before upanayana ) a bath would be necessary. Vas. Dh. 8. (II. 6 ) quotes &amp; verge of Harita to the effect &lsquo;up till investi ture with the girdle of muõja grass ( i. e. till upanayana ) there is no action that is obligatory on him, as long as he is not born again for Vedio study he may be in his conduot like &amp; sūdra *438, This verse occurs also in Baud. Dh. S. I. 2. 6 and Manu II. 171 and 172. Daksa I. 3-4 gays Till a boy is eight years old he is like one newly born and only indicates the caste in which he is born.

As to prāya soitta when a child is guilty of the commission of a mah.. pātaka, sea under prāyaścitta later on and the Mit on Yāj. III. 253. The sinṭtis look upon upanayang as the second birth of a boy (the first being his physical birth ) &ldquo;1. Gaut. (X. 1 and 51 ) says that the three higher classes are called dvijātis ( having two births ), while the sūdra is only ekajāli. +48 Ap. Dh. S, says (1. 1. 1. 16-18 ), the teacher causes him ( the boy who is initiated into Vedio study ) to be born from vidyā (i.e. by imparting Vedic knowledge ), that birth is superior, the parents produce only the body s43. Upanayana is like Baptism and St. John (3. 3 ) also says&rsquo; except a man be born again, he cannot see the Kingdom of God.' Manu II. 147-148 ( = Viṣnu Dh, S. 30. 45-46 ) convey the same idea. Manu ( II. 169 ) speaks of three births in the case of a man, first birth from his mother, the second when the girdle is tied (i, e, on upana yana ) and the third when he is initiated for &amp; Vedic sacrifice. Upanayana is the foremost of the samskārasAtri (141-142 ) says &lsquo;a person is known as a brābmaṇa by birth, he is said to be a dvija ( twice-born) on account of samskāras, he reaches the position of a vipra by learning ( study of the Veda ); he is called śrotriya on account of all these three&rsquo;, 144 Parāśara (VIII. 19) contains a fine image to illustrate this just as a work of painting gradually unfolds itself on account of the several colours (with which it is drawn), so brahmanya (the status of a brāhmaṇa) is similarly</p>

<p>brought out by samskāras performed according to prescribed</p>

<p>Therefore it is now time to speak of samskāras.</p>
<p>The word samskāra hardly ever occurs in the ancient Vedic literature, but the root “kf' with &lsquo;sam&rsquo; and the past passive participle &lsquo;samsksta&rsquo; occur often enough. In Rg. V. 76.2 the word samsksta is applied to &lsquo;gharma&rsquo; (vessel) <em>the two Asvins do not harm the gharma that has been purified.' In Rg. VI. 28. 4 we have the word sanskrtatra' and Rg. VIII. 33. 9 hasranāya samskrtah'. Sat,</em>** Br. I. 1. 4. 10 speaks of preparing (or purifying) offering (havis ) for the gods. So in Sat. Br. III. 2. 1. 2% therefore a woman approaches a man who stands in &amp; well-trimmed (samskýta ) house.' Vide Vāj. S. IV. 34 for a similar use of samaksta. In Chan. Up. IV. 16. 2, we 448 read &ldquo;of that sacrifice there are two ways, by mind, by speech; the Brahmā (priest) prepares (or polishes ) one of them by his mind.&rdquo; The word samskāra is used several times in the sutras of Jaimini ( as in III. 1. 3, III. 2. 15 and 17, III. 8. 3, IX, %, 9, 42, 44, IX, 3.25, IX. 4. 33, IX. 4. 50 and 54, X, 1.2 and 11 &amp;c.). It generally means some purificatory aot in a sacrifice e. g. in Jaimini III. 8. 3 the word is applied to the actions of shaving the head, washing the teeth and paring the nails on the part of the sacrificer in Jyotiṣtoma; in IX. 3, 25 the word samskāra is applied to prokṣaṇa ( sprinkling with water), in X. 2. 49 it is applied to the sharing of the head and face. In Jaimini *** VI. 1.35 the word samskāra stands for upanayana. Sabara explains 448 samskāra as that which being effected makes &amp; certain thing or person fit for a certain purpose and the Tantra vārtika says that samskāras are those actions and rites that</p>

<p>impart fitness and it further says 449 &ldquo;fitness is of two kinds; it arises by the removal of taints (sins) or by the generation of fresh qualities. Samskāras generate fresh qualities, while tapas brings about the removal of taints. He who performs such sacrifices as Jyotiṣtoma and others has certain blemishes in him due to not doing in this life or a previous life duties laid down for him or doing what is forbidden. If they (blemishes) are not removed they obstruct the ( acquisition of the) reward of the sacrifice even if it be entirely free from any defects whatever, as they (blemishes ) produce (for the sacrificer) the experience of their own fruits that are opposed to the (fruit of the ) sacrifice.' The Viramitrodaya 450 (on sarskāra ) defines *saṁskāra' as &lsquo;&amp; peculiar excellence due to the performance of rites ordained (by the śāstra ) which resides either in the Boul or the body and says that it is of two kinds, one kind making a person eligible for performing other actions (e. g. upanayana renders &amp; person eligible for Vedio study), while another kind removes the evil taint that may have been gene rated (e. g. Jatakarma removes the taint due to seed and uterus). The word saṛskāra does not ocour in most of the grhyasūtras ( it ocours in Vaik. ), but it ocoura in the Dharmasūtras (vide Gaut. VIII. 8, Ap. Dh. I. 1. 1. 9, Vas. IV. 1).</p>
<p>The principal matters that fall to be discussed under ganskaras are: the purpose of sarskāras, the classification of Bamskāras, the number of samskāras, the procedure of each of the saṁskāras and the persons authorized to perform them and the persons for whom they are to be performed.</p>
<p>First as to the purpose of saṇskāras. Mann ( II. 27-28 ) says &lsquo;In the case of dvijātis, the taints (or sins ) due to seed and the uterus (1. e. derived from parents ) are wiped off by the homas ( burnt oblations) performed during pregnancy and by jātakarma ( ceremonies on birth), caula ( tonsure ) and the tying of the girdle of muñja grass. This (human) body is rendered fit for the attainment of brahma by the study of the Veda, by ( observance of) yratas, homas ( oblations in fire ), by the vrata called traividya, by worship (of gods, sages and manos), by generation of sons, by the performance of the five daily</p>

<p>saorifices and by (solemn Vedio ) sacrifices. The view of Yaj. (I, 13 ) is that &lsquo;thus (i.e. by the performance of samskāras ) the taint arising from the seed and uterus (i. e. from the physioal defects of parents ) is removed.&rsquo; These words of Manu and Yāj. are variously interpreted by the commentators. Medhatithi says &lsquo;sead and uterus are not the causes of sin and therefore all that is meant by enas ( in Manu II. 27 ) is impurity.&rsquo; Kullūka explains that blemishes of seed are those arising from intercourse in a prohibited manner and the *garbhika&rsquo; blemish is what arises from huving to stay in the womb of an impure mother. The Mit. 451 on Yāj. I. 13 makes it clear that samskāras are deemed to remove bodily defects trans mitted from parents (euch as defective limbs, diseases &amp;c. ) and are not intended to remove the taint of being born of sinful parents. Manu II. 66 also states that all the samskāras are performed on a woman also for the purification of the body. Hārsta $8 as quoted in the Samskāratattva says when a person has intercourse according to the procedure of garbhādhāna he establishes in the wife a foetus that becomes fit for the reception of the Veda, by the rite of punsavana he makes the garbha become &amp; male, by the ceremony of Simantounayana he removes from the foetus the taint derived from the parents and the accumu lated taints ( which are five ) due to seed, blood and womb are removed by jātakarma, nāmakarana, annaprāśana, cūdākarana and samāvartana. By these eight sam,kāras (from garbha. dhāna) purity arises.&rsquo; The exact significance of samskāras in the development of bigher human personality was left rather vague in our authorities and their treatment of the purpose of samskāras is not very elaborate or exhaustive. The samskaras had been treated from very ancient times as necessary for unfolding the latent capacities of man for development and as being the outward symbols or signs of the inner change whioh would fit human beings for corporate life and they also tended to confer &amp; certain status on those who underwent them. If we look at the list of sarskāras we shall find that the purposes</p>

<p>of samskāras were manifold. Some like Upanayang served spiritual and cultural purposes, they brought the unredeemed person into the company of the elect, they opened the door to Vedio study and thus conferred special privileges and exacted duties. They have also psychological values impressing on the mind of the person that he has assumed a new role and must strive to observe its rules. Other samskāras like namakarapa, annapraśana, and niskramana were more or less of a popular nature. They afforded opportunities for the expression of love and affection and for festivities. Other samskāras like garbhādhāna, pursevana, simantonnayana had also mystical and symbolical elements. Vivāha (marriage) was a sacrament which brought about a union of two personalities into one for the purpose of the continuance of society and for the uplift of the two by self-restraint, by self-sacrifice and mutual co-operation.</p>
<p>The samskāras were divided by Hārlta into two kinds, brahma and daiva. *$3 The saraskāras of garbhadhana and others which are described only in the smṛtis are called brābma and the man who is purified by performing them attains equality with sages, stays in the same world with them and is joined with them; pakayajñas ( offerings of cooked food ), yajñas with burnt offerings and sacrifoes in which soma is offered are called daiva (samskāras ). The last two varieties, viz. those in which there is burnt offering and those in wbich Boma is offered, are dealt with in the frauta sūtras, which have been left outside the purview of this work (except in the note at the end of this volume).</p>
<p>There is a great divergence of views among the writers on smrtis as to the number of samskāras. Gaut. ( VIII. 14-24) speaks of forty samskāras and eight virtues of the soul. The forty samskāras ars: garbhādhāna, pumaavana, sīmantonnayana; jātakarma, nāmakarana, annapraśana, caula, upanayana (8 in all ), the four vratas of the Veda, snana (or gamāvartana ), vivāha, five daily mahāyajñas (for deva, pits, manusya,</p>

<p>bhūta and brahma); seven pakayajñas *** (viz. aṣtaka, pārvapasthāllpaka, śrāddha, srāvapl, agrahāyani, caitri, aśva yuji); seven haviryajñas (in which there is burnt offering but no soma ) viz. Agnyādbeya, Agnihotra, Darśapūrṇamāsa, Agrayana, Caturmasyas, Nirudhapaśubandha and Sautrāmapi); seven soma sacrifices (Agniṣtoma, Atyagniṣtoma, Uktbya, Şodasin, Vājapeya, &lsquo;Atirātra, Āptoryāma). Gautama uses the word samskāra in the most extended sense. Saṅkba as quoted by the Sm. C. (I. p. 13) and the Subodhini on Mit. II. 4 follow Gautama. Vaik. speaks of eighteen sārira samskāras (in which he includes utthina, pravāsāgamana, piṇdavardhana, which are seen nowhere else as saṇskāras) and twenty-two yajñas (i. e. five daily yajā as as one and seven pākayajñas, seven havir-yajñas, and seven Boma yajñas). Most grhyasūtrag, dharmasūtras and smstis do not enumerate so many. Angiras ( quoted in the Samskāra mayūkba, Samskāra-prakāśa p. 135 and other digests) mentions twenty-five samskārag. They inolude all sarskāras of Gautama from garbhādhana to the five daily yajñas ( which latter are reckoned as one saṁskāra by Angiras ) and after nāmakarana niskramana is added. Besides, Viṣnubali, Agrayana, Aṣtakā, Srāvapl, Aśvayuji, Mārgasirṣi ( same as Agrahāyaṇi), Pārvana, Utsarga and Upākarms are enumerated as the remaining samskāras by Angiras. Veda-Vyāsa . 14-15 enumerates sixteen samskāras. Manu, Yaj., Viṣnu Dh. S, do not give the number of samskāras but simply say that they are those from niṣeka (garbhādhana) to smagāna (i. e. antyesti). This last one is not treated of in Gautama and several grh yasūtras. In most of the digests the principal samskāras are said to be sixteen; but there is some difference of opinion even as to these sixteen, 455 For example, Jātūkarnya as quoted in Sam. Pr. (p. 135 ) enumerates the 16 as garbhādhāna, pumsavana, simanta, jātakarma, nāmakaraṇa, annasrāśana, caula, mauñji</p>

<p>According to some the seven pakayajñas are : aupasanaboma, Vaiśvadeva, pārvada ( sthālīpāka), astaka, sraddha (montbly), sarpabali and ilangbali. Vide Sm. C. I. p. 13. The Baud. gr. I. 1. gives the govon pakayajñas as huta, prabuta, abuta, kulagava, balibaraga, pratyavaroba pa and aptaka homa. Vide 8. B. E, Vol. 30 p. 358 for several differing onumerations of paka yajñas.</p>

<p>(upanayana ), vratas (four), godana, samavartana, vivāhs and anty eṣti. These slightly differ from the sixteen of Veda-Vyisah</p>
<p>The grhyasūtras deal with Samskāras in two different sequences. Many of them begin with vivāha ( marriage ) and then proceed up to samāvartana. Some like the Hiranya kesigrhya, Bhāradyājagṣhya and Mānavagļhya begin with upanayana. 458 Some saṇskāras like Karnavedha and Vidya rambha are conspicuous by their absence in the grbyasūtras, but are added by later smstis and purāṇas. The following is the list of all the samskāras usually so called in most of the smrti works together with a few remarks against each as to the work or works in whioh each is mentioned or described. The samskāras are arranged in the sequence of the times at which in &amp; man&rsquo;s life they are performed beginning from garbhādhāna:</p>
<p>Rtu-sargamana-mentioned in Vaik. *S? I. 1 as distinct from garbhādhāna; it calls it niṣeka also (VI. 2) and describes it in III. 9 and garbhādbāna in III. 10. The Vaik. commences the saṁskāras with niṣeka.</p>
<p>Garbhadhāna: Nizeka : Caturthikarma or-homa:- Manu (II. 16 and 26 ), Yāj. I. 10-11, Viṣṇu Dh. 8.( 2. 3 and 27.1) employ the word niṣoka as equivalent to garbhādhāna. In the Saṅkhim yana gļhya (I. 18-19), Pār. gr. I. 11, and Ap. 85. (8. 10-11) the rite called caturthikarma or caturthiboma takes the place of the rite oalled garbhādhāna elsewhere and there is no separate description of garbhādhāna in these and some similar</p>

<p>For detailed treatment of some of the sarsköras, vide Dr. (Mrs.) Kamalabai Deshpando&rsquo;s work tbe Child in ancient India&rsquo;(with copious references to the gṛhye sutras); Mrs. Stevenson&rsquo;s &lsquo;the Ritos of the twice-born&rsquo; (1920), which exhaustively reviows in the minutest details the rites of brahmanas (particularly in Kathiawar and Gujarat) as observed at present. This work however gives hardly any references to original Sanskrit authorities, is permeated by the spirit of a Christian missionary and commits the mistake, usual with most Western writers, of comparing hoary Indian customs, usages and the position of women with those of the West only in the latter half of the:19th century, alton gother ignoring what existod in Europe over a few bundred years ago, though it is generally written with sympatby and understanding.

<p>grhyasūtras. The Baud. 87. (IV. 6. 1), the Kathakagļhya (30.8), Gaut. ( VIII. 14), Yāj. I. 11 employ the word garbha dhāna. According to Vaik. (III. 10 ) the garbhādhāna rite follows niṣeka or stu-samgamana (union of married pair after menstruation) and consists in ensuring conception.</p>
<p>Pursavana :-occurs in almost all the gļhyasātras, in Gaut., in Yāj. (1. 11).</p>
<p>Garbharakṣana mentioned in the śānkhāyana gr. ( 1. 21). It seems to be the same as the Anavalobhang which according to the Aśvalāyana gr.(I, 13.1) occurs in the Upaniṣad and which is described in Aśv. gr. (1. 13, 5-7).</p>
<p>Simantonnayana :-This occurs almost everywhere. Yāj. I. 11 uses the word simanta.</p>
<p>Viṣnubali :&ndash;mentioned in Baud. gr. (I. 10. 13-17 and I. 11.2), Vaik. (III. 13), Angiras. It is not mentioned by Gautama and several other ancient sūtrakāras.</p>
<p>Soṣyanti-karma or-homa:-described in Khādira and Gobbila. It is called Sosyanti-savana in Kathaka-gphya and Kṣiprasuvana in Ap. gr., Bharadvāja gr. and Kṣipraprasavana in Hir. gr. (S. B. E. vol. 30, p. 210). It occurs in Budhasmrti (as quoted in Samskāra-prakāśa p. 139 ).</p>
<p>Jatakarma :&ndash;This is described in all sūtras and smṛtis.</p>
<p>Utthāna :&ndash;mentioned only in the Vaik. (III. 18 ) and in San, gr. I. 25 ( S. B. E. vol. 29, pp. 51-52).</p>
<p>Namakarana :-mentioned in all smrtis.</p>
<p>Niṣkramana or Upaniṣkramana or Adityadarśana or Nirna. yana:-Yaj. I. 11 speaks of it as Niskramana, Pār. gr. (I 17 ) as Niskramanika, Manu IL. 34 speaks of it as Niṣkramaṇa. The Kausikastra 58. 18 calls it Nirṇayana; while Baud. gr. (II. 2) employs the word upaniṣkramaṇa; Mānava gr. (1. 19, 1), Viṣnu Dh. S. ( 27. 10), Saṅkba (in verse, IL 5 ) employ appropriately the name Adityadarsana. Gaut., Ap. gr. and several other sūtras omit it.</p>
<p>Karnavedhamomitted in almost all anoient smrtis ; men tioned in Veda-Vyās, sporti ( I. 19), Baud. gr. sesa-sūtra (I. 12. 1), Katyāyana-sūtra ( &amp; supplement to Pār. gr.)</p>

<p>Upanayana :-mentioned by all. It is called vratadesa in Veda-Vyāsa I. 14.</p>
<p>Vratas (four):&ndash;mentioned by most of the gļhyasūtras. Keśānta or Godāna :&ndash;Mentioned by almost all.</p>
<p>Samāvartana or Snāna &mdash;there is great divergence about these two. Manu (IIL. 4) seems to keep snāna ( ceremonial bath after the period of studentship is over ) as distinct from samā. Vartana. Gaut., Ap. gr. V. 12-13, Hir. gr. I. 9. 1, Yāj. L. 51, Pār. gr. ( II. 6-7) employ the word snāna for both the ceremo nial bath and the rites of return from the teacher&rsquo;s house on finishing one&rsquo;s studies, while Asv. gr. (III. 8. 1), Baud. g?. (II. 6. 1), Sān. gr. III. 1, Ap. Dh, S. (I. 2. 7.15 and 31 ) employ the word Samāvartana.</p>
<p>Vivāha :&ndash;Mentioned by all as a samskāra.</p>
<p>Mahāyajñas :-five daily yajāas; mentioned by Gaut., Angiras and others,</p>
<p>Utsarga -( seasonal giving up of Veda studies ) is men tioned as a samskāra in Vaik (1.1) and by Angiras.</p>

<p>Antyeṣti :-mentioned by Manu II. 16 and Yāj I. 10.</p>
<p>It is laid down that the sarskāras from jātakarma to gūdakarma were to be performed in the case of the twice-born classes with Vedio mantras when the child was a male and that in the case of girls the ceremonies were to be performed but without Vedic mantras ; vide Asy, gs. (I. 15. 12, 1. 16. 6, I. 17.18), Manu II. 66, Yaj I. 13. But marriage in the case of the girls of the three higher classes was to be performed with Vedio mantras ( Manu II, 67. Yaj. I. 13).</p>
<p>The samskāras 458 from garbhadhāna to upenayana alone were absolutely necessary in the case of all twice-born persons ;</p>

<p>History of Dharmaśāstra</p>
<p>Oh, Vi</p>
<p>the samskaras of snana and vivaha were not obligatory, as &amp; men was allowed to become a samnyāsin ( ascetio) immediately after finishing the period of studenthood (according to the Jabalo paniṣad ). The Samskāraprakasa enters upon an elaborate discussion as to whether jātakarma could be performed for a child that is neither &amp; male nor a female (pp. 195-197) and arrives at the conclusion that jātakarma and other samskaras cannot be performed for a kliba ( impotent) child.</p>
<p>Another question was as to what samskāras could be per formed for the sūdra. The view of Vedavyāgs that he could have ten samskāras performed (but without Vedio mantras ) has been stated above (p. 159 ). The Baijavāpa *s9 gļhya says that seven samskāras are allowed to the sūdra viz. froun garbhādhāna (or niṣeka ) to caula. The view of Aparārka 160 appears to be that the eight saröskāras from garbhādhāna to caula (in Yāj. 1.11-12) were meant for all varnas (including the sūdra). According to the Madanaratna, Rūpanārāyaṇa and the bhāṣya of Harihara as quoted in the Nirnayasindhu, the sūdras were entitled to perform six saṛskāras viz. jatakarma, nāmakarana, niṣkra maṇa, annaprāśana, cūdā and vivaha and the five daily mahā. yajñas. The Sūdrakrtya-tattva of Raghunandana (p. 634 ) quotes &amp; verse from the Varahapurāna 461 this very procedure (about sraddha ) has been declared in the case of sūdras but without mantras; for the sūdra who is not entitled to repeat a mantra, a brāhmaṇa repeats the mantra&rsquo; and then remarks that for a sūdra a mantra from the purāṇas is to be repeated by the brāhmaṇa priest employed, that the sūdra is not to repeat even the purāṇa mantras but has only to say &ldquo;namaḥ'. The Nirnayasindhu 462 mentions with approval the same view of Śūlapāṇi that in all religious ceremonies for sūdras the man. tras are to be takon from the purāpas and that they are to be repeated by the brāhmana priest. The Brahmapurāṇa 468 quoted</p>

<p>in the Sm, O.( I. p. 24 ) and other digests states that no other sarskāra than vivāba is allowed to the sūdrs. On this the Nirpayasindhu remarks that these conflicting views are to be reconoiled by holding that the liberal ones apply to good (sat) sūdras and the stricter ones to low ( ayat) sūdras or that the rules are different in different countries.</p>
<p>It is to be noted that in modern times most of the samg. kāras (except garbbadhana, upanayana and vivāha) have fallen into oblivion and are bardly ever performed even by brāhmaṇas in the manner and at the times prescribed by the smrtis. Owing to the rapid rise in the marriageable age of brābmana girls, even the samskāra of garbhādhāna is falling into abeyance. Nāmakarana, annaprāśana are performed in a popular way but without Vedio mantras or without calling &amp; priest to officiate. In most cases caula is performed on the day of the upanayans and samāvartana is also performed a few days after upanayana. Jātakarms and annaprābana are performed on the same day in some parts (e. g. in Bengal). It appears that this state of things has continued for centuries. The Smṛtyarthasāra ** (p. 3) says &lsquo;if the samskāras (except upa nayana ) are not performed at the prescribed times, the Vyāhrti homa should be offered and then the samskāras should be per formed (though late ). For each samskāra that is not performed the penance called pādakṣcchra should be performed (if the non performance is due to some difficulty or distress ), and for non performance of caula the penance is ardha-kpoobra. If the sams kāras were knowingly omitted or if there was no distress then the penance is double &ldquo;$ of this.&rsquo; The Nirnayasindhu quotes verses of Saunaka *68 to this effect and then remarks that there was a conflict of views, some holding that after the penance the samskāras passed over should be performed all at one time,</p>

<p>while others held that they should not be performed at all after undergoing penance and a third view was that if caula was left unperformed it may be performed on the same day as upanayana. The Dharmasindhu (3rd pariccheda, purvārdha) states various substitutes (which are comparatively easy ) for these penances. For example, one prājāpatya penanoe is equal to three Pādaksochras. In place of prājāpatya the person guilty of the lapse may make the gift of a cow or (in the absence of a cow ) may give one niṣka (320 guñjās) of gold or one half or one-fourth of it; one who is very poor may give one-eighth of &amp; silver niṣka or corn of that value. There being these easy substitutes (pratyāmnāya as they were called ) people gradually left off performing the several samskāras and concentrated themselves only on upanayana and vivāha. The whole life of a person was 80 very minutely worked out and overlaid with so much ritual in the grhyasātras and smrtis that the tendency to neglect and change became insistent and inevitable. This tendency was helped by the accommodating spirit of the brāhmana authors of later smitis and digests that were ready to prescribe easier and easier substitutes for non-observance of the elaborate Sacraments, pre-natal and post-natal. Haradatta in commenting on Gaut. I. 6 ( upanayanam brāhmaṇasya aṣtame ) remarks the teacher (Gautama ) expounding upanayana first and passing over the samskāras like garbhadhāns that precede upanayana in time conveys that upanayana is the principal samskāra. Therefore even if the samskāras like garbhādbāna did not take place owing to adverseness of fate, upanayana can be performed, but it follows that if upanayana be not performed there is no adhikūra ( eligibility ) for marriage which follows only after upanayana.&rsquo; 467 In modern times in undergoing prayascitta for non-performance of the samskāras up to caula rupees two have to be paid to the priest (annas four for each of the samskāras not performed up to caula and annas eight for caula ).468</p>

The method followed will be as follows. Each samskāra will be described from a few representative gļhya and dharma sutras such as the Ābv. gr., Āp. 8F., and references will be given to other important works. Only important parts of procedure can be noted, minute divergences among the several works being passed over. Greater details will be given in the case of the two ohief samskāras viz, upanayana and marriage which are in vogue even now. 468</p>
<p>Garbhadhāna:&ndash;The beginnings of this ceremony are found very early. Atharvaveda V. 25 appears to be a hymn intended for the garbhādhāna rite.

VI. 4. 13, 19&ndash;22 may be rendered thus : &lsquo;At the end of three days ( after menstruation first appears ) when she ( wife ) has bathed, the husband should make her pound rice ( whioh is then boiled and eaten with various other things according as he desires a fair, brown or dark son or a learned son or &amp; learned daughter )&hellip; and then towards morning, after having according to the rule of the Sthallpaka performed the preparation of the clarified butter, he sacrifices from the Sthalipaka little by little,</p>

Innumer able modifications were introduced and usages cropped up among the people, partioularly owing to the influence of womon, of which gmṛtis and digests take po notice.

<p>nights after marriage having elapsed, on the fourth the husband makes into fire eight offerings of cooked food to Agni, Vayu, Sārya ( the mantra being the same for all three except the name of the deity), Aryaman, Varuna, Pūṣan (mantras being the Bame for these three ), Prājāpati (the mantra is Rg.

(I. 11, S. B. E. vol. 29, pp. 288-290 ) also has a similar procedure. Ap. gr. (8. 10-11, S. B. E. vol. 30, Pp. 267-268 ), Gobbila II. 5 (8. B. E. vol. 30, pp. 51-52) give briefly a similar prooedure, but refer to mantras given in the Mantrapātha (e. g. Āp. M. P. I. 10. 1. to I. 11. 11 ). To modern minds it appears strange that intercourse should have been surrounded by so much of mysticism and religion in the ancient sutras. But in ancient times every act was sought to be invested with a religious halo; so much so that socording to Hir. gr. I. 7. 25.3. (S.B. E. vol. 30, p. 200) Atreya held that mantras were to be repeated at each cohabitation throughout life, while Bādarayana prescribed that this was necessary only at the first cohabitation and after each monthly course.478 The Hir. gs. (1.7, 23.11 to 7 25, 8. B. E. vol. 30 pp. 197-200) gives &amp; very elaborate rite, but on the same lines as the above grhyasūtras. One of the mantras is interesting on account of its reference to the cakravāka birds (1. 7. 24. 6), &ldquo;The conoord that belongs to the oakrayaka birds, that is brought out of the rivers of which the divine Gandharva is possessed, thereby we are concordant ( S. B, E. vol. 30, p. 198). The Vaik. (III. 9 ) calls this ceremony ptusamgamana and is similar to Ap. gr. and Hir. gs. It will be seen that the</p>

<p>caturthikarma is treated by the gļhya writers as part of the marriage rites and the rite was performed irrespective of the question whether it was the first appearance of menses or whether the wife had just before the marriage come out of her monthly illness. This indicates that it was taken for granted that the wife had generally attained the age of puberty at the time of marriage. As the marriageable age of girls oame down it appears that the rite of caturthikarma was discontinued and the rite was performed long after the ritual of marriage and appropriately named garbhādhāna.</p>
<p>The smrtis and nibandhas add many details some of which will have to be noticed. Manu (III. 46 ) and Yāj. I. 79 say that the natural period (for conception ) is sixteen nights from the appearance of menses, Ap. gļ. 9. 1 says 478 that each of the even nights from the 4th to 16th ( after the beginning of the monthly illness ) are more and more suited for excellence of (male) offspring. Hārlta also says the same. These two appear to allow garbhidhāna on the fourth night, but Manu (III. 47 ), Yāj. ( I. 79 ) lay down that the first four nights must be omitted. Katyayana, Parāśara (VII. 17) and others say that a woman in her menses is purified by bathing on the 4th day. Laghu-Āśvalāyana (III. 1) says that the garbhādhāna ceremony should be performed on the first appearance of menges after the 4th day has elapsed. The Sm. C. suggests that the 4th may be allowed if there is entire cessation of the flow, 474 Manu (IV, 128 ) and Yāj. I. 79 added further restrictions viz. that new moon and full moon days and the 8th and 14th tithis of the month were also to be omitted. Astrological details were added by Yāj 80 ( that the Mūla and Maghā constellations must be avoided and the moon must be auspiciously placed) and other later smrtis, which it is unnecessary to dwell upon. In the later smrtis like Laghu-Asvalāyana III. 14-19 and in nibandhas like the Nirṇayasindhu and Dharmasindhu elaborate discussions are held about the months, tithis, week</p>

<p>days, nakṣatras, colour of clothes, that were deemed to be inauspicious for the first appearance of menges and about the sāntis (propitiatory rites) for averting their evil effects. Ap. gr., Manu (III. 48), Yaj. (I. 79), Vaik. III, 9 hold that a man desirous of male issue should cohabit on the even days from the 4th day after the appearance of menges and if he cohabits on uneven days &amp; female child is born. Hir. gr. *75 1. 7. 24.8 (8. B. E. vol. 30 p. 199 ) and Bhāradvaja gr. (I. 20 ) prescribe that a woman in her menses who takes a bath on the 4th day should attire herself in white ( or pure ) clothes, should ornament herself and talk with (worthy ) brāhmaṇas (only ). The Vaik. (III. 9) further adds that she should anoint herself with unguents, should not converse with &amp; woman, or a sūdra, should gee no one else except ber husband, since the child born becomes like the male whom a woman taking a bath after the period looks at. Saṅkba-Likhita convey a similar eugenio suggestion, 678 viz. &ldquo;Women give birth to a child similar in qualities to him on whomsoever their heart is set in their periods.&rsquo;</p>
<p>A debatable question is whether garbhadhāna is a samskāra of the garbha (the child in the womb) or of the woman. Gaut. VIII. 24, Manu. L 16, and Yāj. I. 10 indicate that it is a samskāra of the garbha and not of the woman. Visvarūpa &ldquo;TT on Yaj. 1. 11 expressly aggerts that all samskāras except Simantonnayana have to be performed again and again (as they are the saṁskāras of the garbha ), wbile Simantonnayans being a samskāra of the woman has to be performed only once and this opinion was in consonance with the usage in his days. Laghu-Aśvaldyana ( IV. 17) also holds the same view. Medha tithi 478 on Manu IL 16 says that the garbhadhāna rite with mantras was performed after marriage only once at the time of the first cohabitation according to some, while according to</p>

<p>otbers it was to be performed after every menstruation till conception. Later works like the Mit. (on Yaj. I. 11), the Sm. C., the Samskāratattva (p. 909 ) hold that garbhādhāna, pumsavada 479 and Bimantonnayana are samskāras of the woman and are to be performed only once and quote Hārita in support. Aparārka holds that slmantonnayana is performed only once at the first conoeption, while puinsavana is repeated at esch conception. He relies on Pār, gr. I. 15; and the Sams kāra-mayūkha and the Samskāraprakāśa (pp. 170-171) hold the same opinion. Sm. O.( I. p. 17 ) quotes a verse of Viṣnu that Bocording to some even simantonnayana is repeated at each conception. About the rules for women who are rajasvalā (in their monthly course ) vide later on.</p>
<p>According to Kullūka (on Manu II, 27), the Sm. O. (I. p. 14) and other works garbhādhāna is not of the nature of homa. The Dharmasindhu says that when garbhādhāna takes place on the first appearance of menses, homa for garbhādhāna is to be performed in the gṛbya fire, but there is no homa when the cohabitation takes place on the second or later appearance of menses ; that those in whose sūtra no home is prescribed should perform the garbhādhāna rite on the proper day after the first appearance of menses by reciting the mantras but without homa. The Samskarakaustubha (p. 59 ) relying on Gshyapari sista prescribes homa in which cooked food is to be offered to Prajapati and seven offerings of ājy&amp; are to be offered in fire, three with the verses &lsquo;Viṣnur-yonim&rsquo; (Rg. X. 181. 1-3), three with &lsquo;nejameṣa&rsquo;( Ap. M. P. I. 12, 7–9) and one with Rg. X. 121. 10 ( prajapate na ).</p>
<p>All samskāras other than garbhādhāng can be performed by any agnate in the absence of the husband ( vide Samskāra prakāśa 480 p. 165 ).</p>

<p>Samskāras and homa</p>
<p>207</p>
<p>As homa is necessary in numerous ceremonies and rites, the gphyasūtras give a description of a model boma. Therefore here also it would be well to set out the description from the Aśvalāyana 481 Giphyasūtra ( I. 3, S. B. E. vol 29 pp. 162-163 ), a few important points of difference being added from other gphyasūtras and other works.</p>
<p>&quot; Now wherever ( a person ) intends 48% to offer a sacrifice he should besmear ( with cowdung ) a sthandila (slightly raised equare surface of sand or loose earth) of the dimension at least of an arrow on all (four) sides ; let him then draw six lines (in all) on it, one to the west ( of that part of the sthandila on which the fire is to be placed ) but turned northwards, two lines turned towards the east but separately at the two ends (of the line first drawn); (then he should draw ) three lines in the middle (of the two); let him then sprinkle (the sacred sthandila) with water, establish the ( sacred ) fire (on the sthandila ), put (two or three Bamidhs) on the fire; then he should perform parisamūhana (i. e. wiping or gweeping the ground round the fire), then paristarana ( i. e, strewing darbha grass round) to the east. to the south, to the west, to the north ( in order); in this way (all acts like parisamūbana, paristarana &amp;o.) should end in the north. Then silently he should sprinkle (water) round (the fire). (2) With two (kusa blades used as ) strainers ( pavitra ) the purifying of the djya is done. (3) Having 83 taken two kuga blades with unbroken ends, which do not bear &amp; young shoot in them, of the measure of a span, at their ends with his thumb and fourth finger, with hands turned the inside being upwards, he purifies the ajya (from the west) towards the east with (the words) by the urging of Savitç I purify thee with this uninjured pavitra, with the rays of the Vasu ( i. e. rioh or good ) sun&rsquo;, once with this mantra, twice silently. (4) The strewing of kuga grass ( paristarana ) round the fire may or may not be done in the djya homas ( i. e. sacrifices in which clarified butter alone is to be offered into the fire ).

(7) He should offer the sacrifice with the words &lsquo;to suoh and such a deity, svāha&rsquo;. (8) If there is no specific direction ( as to the deities to whom the offerings are to be made ), the deities are Agni, Indra, Prajāpati, Vigve Devas ( all gods), Brahma. 484 At the end there is an offering to Agni Sviṣtakrt (vide Appendix under note 481 for the mantra ).</p>
<p>In the Saṅkhāyana gr. I. 7 (S. B. E. vol. 29 pp. 22-31 ) the procedure described is more elaborate and contains some important differences. The performer (I. 7. 6-7) draws one line in the middle of the sacrifioial surface from south to north and from this line only three lines are drawn upwards, one to the south of it, one in the middle, and one to the north ( i. a. there are only four lines and not six as in Āśvalāyana ). Further it ( I. 8. 6-7 ) says that the seat of the brahmā priest is to the south of the sthandila and he is honoured with flowers. Sāṅkhāyana adds ( I. 8. 8.) the detail that the pranita waters are carried forward on the north side and (I 8. 9-11) that paristarana follows after the carrying forward of the pranita waters. It also adds (I. 8. 24-25 ) that waters in the sruva spoon are purified just as ajya is purified and then a portion of the water in the sruva is poured on to the pranitā water and the rest of the water in the sruva is called the prokṣanl water with which the havis, the idhma (fuel) and barnis (kuśas) are sprinkled. Saṅkhāyana I. 9. 1 lays down that sruva spoon is the vessel in all gshya rites ( and not juhū as in srauta rites ) except where a special rule to the contrary is stated. The Pār. 87. I 1(8. B. E. vol. 29, pp. 269-270 ) and the Kbādira gr. L2 (8. B. E. vol. 29, pp. 376-378) describe the model homa in a very concise manner. The Gobhila gs. (1. 1. 9-11, and I. 5. 13-20, I. 7. 9, 1. 8. 21), Hir. gr. (1. 1. 9-I. 3.7 8. B. E, vol. 30 pp. 138-145 ) describe it at great length. The sthandila should be prepared on a level spot or on &amp; spot that slopes towards the east or north or north-east ( vido Hir. gr. I. 1. 9, S. B. E. vol. 30, p. 138). The sthandila should be raised to the height</p>

<p>In modern times, after the sthandila is sprinkled with water, fire is established on it under various names depending on the rite to be performed e. g. in upanayang and marriage respec tively the fire is called &ldquo;&lsquo;Samudbhava&rsquo; and &lsquo;Yojaka&rsquo;.

Then follow parisamūhana and other acts stated above.</p>
<p>Just as homa is required in most gļhya rites there are certain matters common to almost all rites. One is that in all samskāras one has to feed brāhmaṇas learned in the Vedas.498 All rites begin with acamana by the performer, prāṇāyāma by him, reference to the desa (place) and kala (time) and a sankalpa ( a declaration of what rite he is performing and for what purpose). After these, according to medieval works, follow in all auspicious rites the worship of Ganapati, pupyābavicana, the worship of Mātrs (mother goddessess) and Nandiørāddha. According to some there is only one sankalpa for all these ; according to others there is a separate saṇkalpa for each of punyābayacana, matrkāpūjana and Nandiārāddba. In all auspicious rites the performer takes a bath first, ties his topknot, has a piece of ground cowdunged and lines with coloured materials are drawn on a portion of the ground, two auspicious kalasas ( jars ) filled with water are placed on such ornamented ground with their mouths covered with a pot, all articles neceszary for worship are placed to the north of the spot, two</p>

<p>wooden low stools or planks are arranged to the west of the spot so decorated, the performer sits on one plank facing the east, bis wife sits to his right and if the ceremony is meant for his son, the latter sits to the right of the wife; the brāhmapas are seated a little away to the right of the wife, facing the north and the performer sips water (takes acamana).

<p>Ganapatipūjana :&ndash;This consists in inviting the presence of the elephant-faced god Gapeśa on a betelnut placed in a handful of husked rice. The word Ganapati is used in the Rgveda as an attribute of Brabmaṇaspati ( the lord of prayer or holy lora ). The well-known mantra (&lsquo;gaṇānām tvā ganapatim havāmabe&rsquo; Rg. II. 23. 1) which is used to invoke Ganesa ia addressed to Brahmanaspati. Indra is addressed as Ganapati in Rg. X. 112. 9. In tbe Tai. S. IV. 1. 2. 2 and Vāj. S. paśus ( and the horse specially ) are said to be the Gāpapatya of Rudra. The Ait, Br. IV. 4 495 expressly says that the mantra &lsquo;ganānām tva&rsquo; is addressed to Brahmaṇaspati. In the Vāj. S. 16. 25 we have the plural (Ganapatibhyalok vo namo&rsquo;) and in 22. 30 we have the singular &lsquo;Ganapataye svāhā&rsquo;. The peculiar features of Gañesa as described in the medieval works, viz. the head of an elephant, pot belly, mouse as vābana ( conveyance) are entirely wanting in the Vedic literature. In Vāj. S. III. 57 the mouse *** is said to be the pasu (animal to be offered to ) of Rudra. In the Tai. Ār. (X. 15 ) there is a verse 197 &lsquo;We contemplate Vakratunda, therefore may the tusked ( god ) impel us&rsquo;. In the Gșhya and Dharma sūtras there is no reference to the worship of Ganesa at the beginning of all auspicious rites. That is comparatively a later cult. In the Baud. Dh. 8. (II. 5. 83-90, 8. B. E. vol. 14. p. 254) the Devatarpana includes the propitia tion of Vighna, Vinayaka, Vira, Sthūla, Varada, Hastimukha,</p>

<p>Vakratunda, Ekadanta and Lambodara. But this part of the Baud. Dh. 8, is of doubtful authenticity. All the above are the appellations of Vinayaka (vide Baud. gļhya-seṣasūtra III. 10,6). In the Mānava grbya II. 14 it is said that the Vināyakas are four viz. Sālakatankaṭa, Kūṣmāndarājaputra, Usmita and Devayajana. They are evil spirits and people when seized by them have bad dreams and see in them inauspicious sights such as shaved persons, persons with matted hair or wearing yellowish garments, camels, hogs, asses, cāṇdālas. When seized by them, princes, though capable, do not get their king doms ; maidens, though endowed with all accomplishments, cannot secure husbands; married women have no children or even virtuous wives lose their children in infancy; husbandmen lose their crops &amp;o. The Mānavagshya then prescribes propi. tiatory rites to remove the effects of Vināyaka seizure. The Baija vāpagphya (quoted by Aparārka p.563 on Yaj. I. 275) Bays** that there are four Vināyakas, Mita, Sammita, Salakataokata and Kūṣmaṇdarājaputra and describes seizure by tbem and its effects in the same way 88 the Mānavagphys. These two show the first stage in the development of the cult of Vināyaka. Vinayakas are at this stage malevolent spirits who cause dangers and obstacles of various kinds. In this cult various elements from the terrific aspects of Rudra were probably first drawn upon and amalgamated with other elements drawn from aboriginal cults. The next stage is indicated by the Yāj. smrti (I. 271-294). Hers Vinayaka ( I. 271 ) is said to be one appoin ted by Brahmā and Rudra to the over-lordship of the Gaṇas, be is represented not only as causing obstacles, but also as bring ing success in the actions and rites undertaken by men. Yāj, enumerates the results of the seizure by Vinayaka in the same way 88 the Mānavagshya, Yaj. I. 285 says that Mita, Sammita, Salakatankata and Kūṣmāṇdarajaputra are the four names 299 of the one Vinayaka and that Ambika is the mother of Vinayaka. It is noteworthy that Yāj. does not</p>

<p>Though Vidvartpa and Apararka take these to be four, it is ourious tbat the Mit. makes them to be six ( viz. Sala and Kataokata as distinct and so also Kaṣmaqda and Rajaputra ). It is remarkable that Kpira on Amarakoso expressly says that Herimba is . Dedya word.

<p>employ any one of the well-known epithets of Vinayaka, viz. Ekadanta, Heramba, Gajānana, Lambodara &amp;o. The Baud. gf. segagūtra III. 10 prescribes &amp; somewhat different procedure for propitiating Vinayaka and styles him &lsquo;the lord of bhūtas&rsquo;, and also hastīmukha&rsquo; and &lsquo;vighnesvara&rsquo; and prescribes the offerings of apūpa and modaka to him. Thus Baudhāyana is nearer to the medieval conception of Ganesa than even Yajna valkya. The Adiparva makes Ganese write the Mahabharata to the dictation of Vyasa ; but this part is apocryphal as many mes, altogether omit this episode (vide J. R. A. 8. for 1898 pp. 380-384, Winternitz). The other references in Vanaparva 65. 23 and Anusāsana 150, 25 bear affinity to the description of Vinayaka in the Mānavagļhya. 500</p>
<p>The Gobhilasmrti (in verse) I. 13 prescribes that at the begin ning of all rites, the Mātrs together with Gaṇādhipa (the lord of Ganas ) should be worshipped. The well-known characteristics of Ganesa and his worship had become fixed before the 5th or 6th century of the Christian era. Kālidāsa does not refer to Ganesan The Gathāsaptaśati has references to Ganesa. In that work (IV. 72) an image of Gaṇeśa is referred to as made use of 88 a pillow and the tip of his trunk is mentioned in V. 3. In Codrington&rsquo;s &lsquo;Ancient India&rsquo; plate XXXIX there is an image of Ganesa referable to about 500 A. D. Vide Dr. Bhandarkar in. Vaisnavism and Saivism' p. 147. Bāṇa in his Harsacarita (IV Ucobvāsa verse 2 ) speaks of the large tusk of Gapādhipa and in describing Bhairavācārya ( Harṣacarita III) associates Vinayaka with obstacles and learning and also indicates that he had the head of an elephant. In the Vāmanapurāna (obap. 54 ) there is a fantastic legend about the birth of Vinayake</p>
<p>The Mahaviracarita ( II. 38 ) speaks of the tusk of Heramba, The Matsyapurāṇa (chap. 260.52-55 ) describes how the images of Vinayaka are to be made. Aparārka (p. 343 ) quotes a pass age from the Matsyapurāṇa ( 289.7) on the mahādana called Mahābhūtaghata, in which it is said that Vinayaka should be shown as riding a mouse. The Krtyaratnākara p. 271 quotes a passage from the Bhaviṣyapurāpa for the worship of Ganese on the 4th day of Bhadrapada. Vide Agnipurāṇa chap. 71 and 313.</p>

<p>Among the earliest epigraphic references to Ganapati is the one in the Nidhanpur plate of Bhaskarvarman (middle of 7th contury ). Vide E. I. Vol. XII. p. 73.508</p>
<p>The Ganapatipājāna consists in the performer repeating the mantra Rg. II. 23. 1 (&lsquo;gaṇānām tvā Ganapatim&rsquo;) AS a prayer and then bowing to Ganeśa with the words &lsquo;Om Maha ganapataye namo namaḥ nirvighnam kuru&rsquo; (Balutations to the great Ganapati, make ( this rite ) free from obstacles'.</p>
<p>Punyāhavācana :-Although many elaborate descriptions of this are given in later digests like the Samskāraratnamala, this was originally in ancient times a very simple and brief rite. The Ap. Dh. S, ( I. 4. 13. 8 ) says that in ordinary life in all auspicious rites ( such as marriage ) all sentences begin with &lsquo;Om&rsquo;as in saying &lsquo;punyābam&rsquo;, &lsquo;svasti&rsquo;, and &lsquo;?ddhim&rsquo;. The performer of a religious rite honours the assembled brahmaṇas with gandha (sandalwood paste ), flowers and tāmbula (botel leaves ) and requests with folded hands &lsquo;may you declare the day to be auspicious for such and such a ceremony which I, by name so and so, am 508 about to perform and then the brahmaṇas</p>

<p>Matrkāpūiana &ndash;The Matrs (the Mother Goddesses ) do not figure in the sūtras. But that their worship was prevalent certainly in the first centuries of the Christian era throughout India oan be proved from several sources. In the drama Mroohakatika (I) Cārudatta asks his friend Maitraya to offer bali to the Matss. The Gobhila-smrti 504 (in verse I. 11-12) names 14 mātṛs viz. Gaurl, Padma, Saci, Medhā, Sāvitri, Vijaya, Jaya, Devasenā, Svadhā, Svāhā, Dhști, Pusti, Tuṣti and one&rsquo;s own deity (abhiṣta-deyatā ). In the Mārkandeya (chap. 88. 11-20 and 38) seven mātrs have been named as Mātrgana. The Matsyapurāṇa (chap. 179. 9-32) names over a hundred mother goddesses (like Mahesvari, Brāhmi, Kaumāri, Cāmunda ), while in chap. 261 (24-36 ), there is a description of the images of some of the matrs like Brahmāṇi &amp;o. The Bṭbat-Samhita of Varāhamihira (chap.58 56) refers to the images of the mother goddesses. Bāṇa in his Kā dambari frequently refers to the mātrs, to their worship and to dila pidated temples of these goddesses.505 The Krtyaratnākara quotes a passage from the Bhavisyapurāṇa at p. 261 about the images of the seven mātṛs and pp. 305 and 307 quote the Devipurāna about the worship of mātṛs and the flowers dear to them. The worship of matrs is mentioned in the Bibar Stone Pillar Inscription of Skandagupta (Gupta Inscriptions pp. 47, 49). The Cālukyas are often described as cherished by the seven mātrs&rsquo; (1. A. vol. VI. p.73 in 535 śake and E. I. vol. IX, p. 100 in 660 A. D.). The Kadambas are described as meditating on Kārtikeya-gvāmi and on the group of mātra (I. A. vol. VI. p. 25 ) 508.

<p>Whence the cult of mātrs, which was not described in the Gphyasūtras, was derived it is difficult to say. Sir John Mar shall in his famous work on Mohenjo-Daro ( vol. I. p. VII and pp. 49-52 and plates XII, XOIV and XCV ) shows how figurines of mother goddesses are common at Mohenjo Daro. That shows that the oult prevailed in the remotest antiquity and was probably taken up by the followers of the Vedio religion and affiliated to the worship of Durgā, the spouse of Siva. In Rg. IX. 102.4 509 the seven mothers are said to regulate soma when it is being prepared ( the seven mothers are probably the seven metres or the seven rivers ).</p>

The Āsv. gṛ. I. 13. 2-7 describes the rite as follows: &lsquo;he should in the third month of pregnancy, under the constel. lation Tiṣya (i. e. Pusya ) give ( tbrice) to eat to the wife, after she has fasted, (on the preceding Punarvasu constellation) in the curds of a cow which has &amp; calf of the same colour (with the cow ) two beans and one grain of barley for each handful of curds. On his asking ( the woman) &lsquo;what dost thou drink? what dost thou drink?&rsquo;, she should thrice reply &lsquo;pumaayana&rsquo;, (generation of a male ), &lsquo;puṁsavana&rsquo;.

Most of the grhyasūtras refer to the pounding of the shoot#18 of the Nyagrodha tree (or some other plant) and inserting the pounded substance in the wife&rsquo;s right nostril. The mantras repeated when inserting the substance in ber nostril are different according to most sūtras. Saṅkhayana (8. B.E. vol. 29, p. 46) prescribes the four verses Rg. I. 1.3, III. 4.9., V. 37. % and IX 3. 9. with svahā at the end of each verse. Pāraskara (S. B. E. vol. 29, p. 292) prescribes Vaj. S. XIII. 4 (Rg. X. 121. 1) and XXXI. 17; Khādira gr. (S. B. E, vol. 29. p. 394 ) mentions Mantra-Brāhmaṇa I. 4. 8, the Kathaka gr. quotes Kathaka Samhita. The several sūtras of the Black Yajurveda show the greatest divergence among themselves.</p>
<p>It would be clear that the puṁsavana rite has several elements, religious (home and son&rsquo;s importance from ancient times), symbolical or suggestive ( the drinking of ourds with beans and grain of barley ) and medioal (inserting some substance in the woman&rsquo;s nostrils). For what purpose the placing of the bile of a tortoise on the woman&rsquo;s lap was prescribed by Pāraskara alone ( I. 14 ) it is difficult to say,</p>
<p>Later works like the Samskāraratnamālā prescribe a homa for pumsavana also and remark that when in the absence of the husband, the husband&rsquo;s brother or other relative performs the rite, it should be performed in ordinary kitohen fire (p. 815 ). This latter rule applies to Simantonnayana also.</p>
<p>Anavalobhana or Garbharakṣama :-This rite was apparently part of Pursavana, Āāv. gf., as already said, separately men tions purgavana and anavalobhana 88 referred to in the Upaniṣad. The Baijavāpa gļ. ( quoted in the Samskārapra kaśa p.171) says &lsquo;He performs the purgavana and anavalobbana in the fortnight of the waxing moon on an auspicious day when the moon is in conjunction with a nakṣatra (deemed to be ) a male&rsquo;. This shows that both were performed on the same day. Another sutra of Baijavāpa quoted in the Samskāramayūkha $14 says that the two are to be performed in the 2nd or 3rd month</p>

<p>of pregnancy. This rite is so called because by virtue of its performance the foetus does not fall out or is not destroyed (i. e. it is really anavalopana from the root lup with ava). Aśv. gr. (I. 13. 5-7) describes it as follows: He then inserts in her right nostril in the shade of a round apartment the (sap) of an herb which is not faded : 515 according to some ( teachers ), with the Prajāvat and Jiyaputra mantras. Having offered a sacrifice of cooked food to Prajapati he should touch the region of her heart with the verge Oh thou whose hair is well parted, what is hidden in thy heart, in Prajāpati, that I understand, (mayst thou understand ) me who know that; inay not injury to the son be my lot&rsquo;.</p>
<p>It will be seen that the inserting of dūrvārasa in the woman&rsquo;s nostril, touching her heart and prayers to the gods for the safety of the foetus are the principal features of this rite in Asv.</p>
<p>Acoording to Saunaka-kārikā ( Ms. in Bombay University Library, folio 138 ) that rite is called anavalobhana whereby the foetus remains undisturbed or does not fall out. 516 According to the Smstyarthasāra it is to be performed in the fourth month. According to Laghu-Asyalāyana IV.1-2 anavalobhana and simantonnayana were to be performed in the 4th, 6th or 8th month of pregnancy and verses 6-7 give the same details as in Āśv. gļ.</p>
<p>The San. gr. (I. 21. 1-3, S. B. E. vol. 29, p. 47 ) speaks of &amp; ceremony called Garbharakṣaṇa (protection of the foetus): &quot; In the fourth month the garbharakṣaṇa; offering six oblations into fire from a mess of cooked food with the six verses of the hymn brabmanāgnih &lsquo;517 (Rg. X. 162 ) with svāha uttered at the end of each verse, with the verses &lsquo;from thy eyes, thy nose&rsquo; (Rg. X. 163. 1-6), besmearing her limbs with clarified butter at each verse. &quot;</p>

<p>Nardyans explains that the berb is durvā according to usage. The sap is put in the nostril silently or to the accompaniment of two mantrar, which are respectively of the sago Prajāvat and Jivaputra. They are: आते गौं योनिमैतु पुमान बाण इवेषुधिम् । आ पीरो जायतां पुत्रस्ते दश मास्य:॥ अग्निरेतु प्रथमो देवतानां सोस्यै मजा मुञ्चत मुत्युपाशात् । तदर्थ राजा परुणोद्धमन्यता पधेयं भी पौधमपं न रोदात् ॥ इति.

<p>This seems to be anothor version of anavalobhana.</p>
<p>According to Asv. gr. kārikās of Kumārila (I. 6.5) this rite is to be repeated on every conception. Most other writers would hold that like pumsavana it is to be performed only once.</p>
<p>Şimantonnayana :&ndash;This is treated in the following gr. sūtras: Asv. I. 14. 1-9; San. I. 22, Ap. 14. 1-8, Hir. II. 1, Baud. I. 10, Bhāradvāja I. 21, Gobhila II. 7.1-12, Khādira II. 2. 24-28, Pār. I. 15, Kāthaka 31. 1-5, Vaikhānasa IIL 12.</p>
<p>This word literally means &lsquo;parting of the hair (of a woman) upwards.&rsquo; Yaj. (1. 11), Veda-Vyasa ( I. 18 ) oall this ganskāra simply &lsquo;simanta&rsquo;, while Gobhila ( II. 7.1), Mānava gr. (1.12.2), Kāthaka gp (31.1) call it simantakarana. Ap. gr. and Bhāra dvāja gr. (I. 21 ) describe it before pumsavana. The Asv. gr. ( I. 14. 1-9 ) describes it as follows: &ldquo;In the fourth month of pregnancy the Simantonnayana (should be performed). In the fortnight of the waxing moon,when the moon may be in conjunc tion with &amp; nakṣatra that is ( regarded as ) male (or the name of which is of the magouline gender, according to Nārāyaṇa ); then he establishes fire (i. e. performs the details of homa up to offering of ūjyabhāgas ) and having spread to the west of the fire a bull&rsquo;s hide with its neck to the east and the hair outside, he makes eight oblations (of ajya, clarified butter), while his wife sits on it ( hide) and takes hold (of his hand ), with the two ( verses) may Dhātr give to his worshipper&rsquo; (Atharvaveda VII. 17. 2-3 ), with the two verses, &lsquo;I invoke Rakā&rsquo; (Rg. II. 32. 4-5), with the three (verses) called &lsquo;nejameṣa&rsquo; (a khilasūkta after Rg. X. 184 and Āp. M. P. I. 12. 7-9) and with the verse &lsquo;Oh Prajāpati, no one other than you&rsquo; (Rg. X. 121. 10). He then three times parts her hair upwards (beginning from the front and pro ceeding backwards ) with a bunch of an even number of unripe fruits with a porcupine quill that has three white spota 518 ( or rings ) and with three bunches of kusa grass, with the words &lsquo;bhūr, bhuvaḥ, svar, om&rsquo; or he does so four times. He gives orders to two lute players&rsquo;sing (praise of) king soma.&rsquo; (They sing this gāthā ) may some, our king, bless the human race.</p>

<p>Fixed is the wheel ( dominion) of this (river); (here they take the name in the vocative ) of the river near which they dwell, And let them do whatever aged brāhmana women whose hus. bands and children are alive direct. A bull is the fee ( for the sacrifice)&rdquo;. In the Āp. mantrapatha thirteen verges are devoted to this samskāra in all, some of which occur in the Rs., the Atharvaveda and Tai, S..</p>
<p>We have here first the religious part of home and oblations with mantras. But this rite is mainly of a social and festival nature intended to keep the pregnant woman in good cheer. The Samskāraprakāśa ( pp. 172-173 ) quotes some verses from an Asyalāyana stating that this rite serves the purpose of driving certain female goblins that thirst for the destruction of the foetus; the parting of the hair by the husband with the quill, bunch of unripe fruits and darbhas and tying a garland round her neok, giving her boiled rice mixed with mudga and ghee and asking lute players to sing indicate its festive character. There is a great divergence among the gphya sutras about the several details of this samskāra and the order in which they take place. The Sm. O. after pointing out a few divergences remarks that one should follow the rules of one&rsquo;s own grbya sutra. A few important divergences are pointed out below. This samskāra was to be performed in the 3rd month according to Kāthaka gr., in 3rd, 6th or 8th according to the Mānava; in the 4th month according to Aśv., Ap., Hir. (II. 1 ), in 4th or 6th according to Gobhila (II. 7. 2) and in the 4th, 6th or 8th according to Khadira, in 6th or 8th according to Paraskara, Yaj. (I. 11), Viṣṇu Dh. S. ( 27. 3), Saṅkha; in the 7th according to Sān. gr. (I. 22. 1), in the 8th according to Vaik, and Veda-Vyāsa (1. 18). Saṅkha as quoted in the Smsticandrikā (I. p. 17) says that it should be performed on the foetus beginning to move and up to the time of delivery, Āśv., Sānand Hir. require that the moon must be in conjunc tion with a malo naksatra. Hir. gr. alone prescribes that the samnskāra should take place in a round apartment. It is remark able that Āśv. alone requires that the woman should be beated on a bull&rsquo;s hide, which shows that till his day such a hide was not treated (as is done in modern times) as a very unholy thing. Pāraskara makes her sit on &amp; soft chair or seat, while Gobhila prescribes a seat of northward pointed darbhas. There is great divergence as to the number of oblations and the verses to be repeated even in sutras of the same Veda, e. g. Asta layana prescribes eight oblations and eight mantras, but</p>
<p>224</p>

<p>[ Ch. VI</p>
<p>Wisband is to that it was in and thr</p>
<p>Śānkhāyana prescribes only six (by omitting the verses Rg. II. 32. 4-5). Gobhila, Khadira, Bhāradvāja, Paraskara and Saṅkhāyana prescribe the preparation of boiled rice with ghee thereon or sesame and the first three of these say that the woman should be asked to look at the ghee on the mass of rice and be questioned &lsquo;what do you see&rsquo; and she should be made to reply &lsquo;I see progeny&rsquo; (Bhāradvāja has the reply &lsquo;sons and cattle&rsquo;). Almost all gļhya sūtras agree that in parting the hair the husband is to use a bunch of unripe fruit (Gobhile, Pār, and Sān, specifying that it was to be Udumbara fruit), a poroupine quill with three white spots and three bunches of kusa grass. Pāraskara and Gobhila add the use of a Viratara stick and a full spindle. Some like Aśv. presoribe that the parting must be done thrice, Gobhila seems to prescribe it six times, while Khādira ( II. 2. 25 ) expressly says that it is to be done only once. Sān, says that the unripe fruits are to be tied to a string of three twisted threads and the string is to be sus pended from her neck as a garland. Par. also seems to suggest the same. Ap. also says that the husband should (by way of ornament) tie a string of barley grains with young shoots on the woman&rsquo;s bead (14.7) and Vaikhānasa says that the woman is to wear a garland and have fragrant unguents applied to her body. Many of the gshya sūtras direct that lute players should sing a verse or verses. Gobhila, Khadira, Vaik, are silent on this point, but Gobhila prescribes that brāhmaṇa women should address auspioious words to her &lsquo;Be you the mother of a valiant son.&rsquo; There is divergence as to whose praise is to be sung. San and Pār. say that the ballad sung must be in praise of the (ruling) king or any one else who is very valiant. ĀśV., Hir., Baud., Bhāradvāja and Pār. prescribe a gāthā in honour of king Soma (the plant). Apastamba refers to two verses, one of which praises king Yaugandhari and the other king Soma and presoribes that the first is to be sung for all varnas residing in the Salve countries, while the second is to be recited by brahmanas. Some of the sūtras like Asv., Pār., Bhāradvāja allow that in the ballad to be sung by the lute players the river on which the woman and her husband dwell is to be invoked. 519</p>

Haradatta explaining Ap gr. says that the country of Salva is on the Jumpa and that Vaidyas are in abundance there. The country of Salva was included in the Kaccbādigaṇa (Papini V. 2. 133, and Mahābhāsya, vol. II. p. 300 ). Panini mentions Salva in IV. 1, 173, IV. 2. 135 and teachos the formation of Yaugand bara in IV, 2. 130 and of Yaugandhari in IV. 1. 173. In the Vana parva 14, 1-5 it is said that the king of Salve whose ca pital was at Saubha attacked Dyāraka. Salyaparva (20.1) calls the Salva king lord of mleccha tribes and speaks of him as fighting for Duryodhana and as killed by Satyaki.

<p>Apastamba, Baud., Bhāradvāja and Pār. expressly say that this saṁskāra is to be performed only onoe at the first conception. For the difference of view among nibandhakāras vide above ( pp. 205-206 ) on garbhādbāna.</p>
<p>Viṣṇu was of opinion that sīmantonnayana is a samskāra of the woman, but that according to some it is &amp; samskāra of the foetus and so was to be repeated at each conception.581 On account of the great divergence of details one may conjecture that this samskāra was not very ancient in the times of the Gșhyasūtras.</p>
<p>It appears however that gradually this picturesque rite. receded in the back ground, so much so that Manu does not even mention it by name, though Yāj. namas it. In modern times in Western India some people perform a rite in the 8th inonth of pregnancy (called in Marathi Athangulen) which retains some vestiges of the ancient rite (such as the garland of udumbara fruit).</p>
<p>Viṣnubali :- According to Vasistha quoted in the Samnskāre. prakāśa (p. 178 ) this ceremony was to be performed in the 8th month of pregnancy, on the 2nd, 7th or 12th tithi of the bright fortnight and when the moon was in the Sravana, Rohiṇi or Puṣya constellation. The same work quotes verses of Aśvala. gana describing the ceremony and stating its purpose viz. to remove harm to the foetus and for easy delivery of the woman and that it was to be performed during every conception. On the preceding day Nāndiørāddha was to be performed and then boma to fire was to be performed up to the offering of ājyabhāgas. To the south of the fire another sthandila of the shape of a lotus or svastika was to be drawn on which 64 oblations of boiled rice with ghee thereon were to be offered to Viṣṇu (some offer them on the fire itself) with the verses of Rg. I. 22. 16-21, Rg. I. 154. 1-6, Rg. VI. 69.1-8, Rg. VII. 104. 11, Rg. X. 90.1-16, Rg. X. 184, 1-3. Then to the north-east of the fire, &amp; square plot should be smeared with cowdung and be divided into 64 squ. ares with white dust and 64 offerings of boiled rice should be offer. ed with the same mantras and in their midst one ball of rice should be offered to Viṣnu with the mantra loudly uttered&rsquo; namo</p>

Then the offering to Agni Svi. stakrt should be made, dakṣiṇā should be distributed and brāb maṇas should be fed. The Vaik. (III. 13) describes Viṣṇubali differently. The gods with Agni as the first are invoked unto the northern pranidhi vessel and then at the end Puruṣa is invoked four times with &lsquo;om bhūb&rsquo;, &lsquo;om bhuyah,&rsquo; &lsquo;om suvaḥ,&rsquo; &lsquo;om bhūr-bhuvah-suvaḥ&rsquo;, then to the east of the fire he invokes Viṣnu on seats of darbha grass with the names, Kesava, Nārāyana, Madhava, Govinda, Viṣṇu, Madhusūdana, Trivikrama, Vāmana, Sridhara, Hrṣikeśa, Padmanābha, Damodara; then he bathes Visnu, with mantras &lsquo;Apah&rsquo; (Tai. S. IV.1.5.11=Rg. X. 9. 1-3), &lsquo;Hirapyavarṇāḥ&rsquo; (Tai. 8. V.6.1) and the chapter beginning</p>
<p>pavamānaḥ&rsquo; (Tai. Br. I. 4.8); he dous worship (with sandal peste, flowers &amp;c. ) by eaoh of Viṣnu&rsquo;s twelve names, then he offers 12 oblations of clarified butter with the mantras ato devā' (Rg. I. 22. 16-21), Viṣnor-nu kam'(Rg. I. 154.1-7=Tai. S. I. 2. 13),' tad-agy&amp; priyanı'( Tai, Br. II. 4. 6 = Rg. I 154.5), &lsquo;pra tadviṣnuḥ&rsquo; (Tai. Br. II. 4. 3 = Rg. I. 154, 2 ), &lsquo;paro mātrayā&rsquo; ( Tai. Br. II. 8. 3), vicakrame trir-devab' ( Tai. Br. II. 8. 3). Then he announcces as offering a mess of rice cooked in milk on which ājya has been poured to the god and sacrifices it to him with the twelve names repeating the twelve mantras ( Rg. I. 22. 16-21, and Rg. I. 154. 1-6): Having praised the god with mantras from the four vedas he should prostrate himself before the god after taking twelve names with the word &lsquo;namaḥ&rsquo; at the end of each (i. e. by saying Keśavāya namah' &amp;o.). What remains of the rice cooked in milk is eaten by the wife.</p>

This seems to be a very ancient rite. It means ' s rite for a woman who is about to be delivered of a child&rsquo;Rs. V. 78.7-9 give the earliest indications of this rite. &lsquo;Just as the wind moves a lake on all sides, so may the foetus move and come out, being (now) in the tenth month. Just as the wind, the forest and the sea are in movement, so mayst thou ( foetus ) that art ( now ) in the tenth month, come out together with the after-birth, may the male child having been sleeping ten months inside his mother, como out a living being, unharmed, from his mother, herself being alive. Br. Up. VI. 4. 23 also refers to this rite &quot; He sprinkles with water the woman who is about to be delivered ( with the mantras) just as the wind &hellip; &hellip; &hellip; may it come out with the</p>

This is &amp; pen 52% of Indra with a bolt and with a chamber for rest; oh Indra, leave it and come out with the foetus and after-birth.&rdquo; Āp. gļ, describes the ceremony as follows: &lsquo;Now is described the rite to secure a rapid delivery. With a cup that has not been dipped in water before he drawe water in the direction of the current (of a river or spring); he places Tūryanti plant at his wife&rsquo;s feet; he should then touch on the head (with both hands) the woman who is in child-birth with the verse ( Āp, mantra-pātha II. 11. 15 ),823 should sprinkle her with the waters ( brought as above ) with the next three verses (Ap. mantra-pātha II. 11. 16-18 ). If the after birth does not come out, he should sprinkle her with the water ( brought ) as directed above with the next two verses &lsquo;(i, e. Āp. mantra-patha II. 11 19-20).52* Hir, is very brief and is similar to Āp., but omits all verses except one (which is part of Ap. M. P. II. 11. 16). Bhāradyāja is similar to Āp., but gives verses that are slightly different from those of the Ap. M. P. Gobhila and Kbadira are very brief and say that a home with two oblations of clarified butter is to be performed with the verses of the Mantra-brāhmaṇa I 5. 6–7. Paraskara also speaks of the sprinkling of the woman with two verses of Vaj. S. VIII. 28-29 (the first being almost like Rg. V. 78.7) and prescribes the recital of Atharvaveda I. 11. 4 for the falling of the after-birth. Adityadarśana on Kathaka gr. ( 33. 1 ) remarks that this rite is not really a samskāra and Devapāla says that this is a rite which has a seen result ( while samskāras are deemed to have an unseen result).</p>

<p>son is born (to a man) &hellip;&hellip; That son, for whom when born they perform this &lsquo;iṣti&rsquo;, does become pure, glorious, substantial in ( abundant) food, full of vigour and possessed of cattle &lsquo;. This shows that Vaisvānareṣti was performed on the birth of a son. Jaimini (IV. 3. 38 ) holds a discussion on this passage and establishes the conclusion that this iṣti is for the benefit of the son and not of the father and the bhāṣya of Sabara gives the further propositions that this isti is to be performed after the jātakarma rites are finished (and not immediately at birth) and that it is to be performed on a full moon day or a new moon day following ten days after birth. The Sat. Br. (9. B. E. vol. 44 p. 129 ) prescribes a certain rite before the navel string is out &ldquo;regarding a new born son let him say to five brāhmaṇas before the navel string has been out ' breathe over him in this way. But if he should be unable to obtain them, he may even himself breathe over him while walking round him&rdquo;. The Bṛ. Up. I. 5. 2 contains the following interesting passage 526 &ldquo;when a boy is born they first make him lick clarified butter, and they make him take the breast ( of the mother) after that.&rdquo; At the end of the Bs. Up. ( VI. 4. 24-28 ) there is an elaborate description of the jātakarma. &quot; When (a son) is born, having kindled the fire, having placed the son on one&rsquo;s lap, having poured curds mixed with ghee in a bell-metal vessel be offers oblations of the curds mired with ghee with the mantras &lsquo;may I maintain a thousand, prospering in my house; may there be no break with regard to progeny and cattle; svāhā! I offer to these in my mind my prāṇas, svāhal Whatever I havo done in excess in my work or whatever I may have left defi cient in this ( rite ), may the wise ( Agni) (called ) Sviṣtakt make that well sacrificed and well offered for us, svābāl&rsquo;. Then after bringing down his mouth up to the right ear of the son he should recite thrice the word &lsquo;speech&rsquo; 587, then having poured together curde, honey and olarified butter, he makes the (son) eat it by means of (a spoon of) gold not covered with anything else with the mantras &lsquo;I place in thee bhūh, I place in thee bhuvah, I place in thee syaḥ, I place in</p>

<p>thee bhūr-bhuvaḥ svaḥ, I place in thee all&rsquo;. Then he gives him (the boy that is born) a name with the words &lsquo;thou art the Veda&rsquo;. That becomes bis secret name. Then he hands the boy over to his mother and gives him the breast of the mother with the mantra (Rg. I. 164, 49 ) &lsquo;Oh, Sarasvati / make that breast ready for being sucked, which lies on thy body, which engenders happiness, by which thou nourishest all blessings, which bestows gems, that wins wealth and is a generous donor&rsquo;. Then he solemnly addresses the mother of the child with the following mantras &lsquo;Oh maitrāvaruṇi 528 1 Oh strong one! thou art Iļā, she ( the mother) has given birth to a valiant ( boy ); mayst thou be endowed with valiant sons, since thou hast made us possessed of &amp; valiant son. They say to him (the newly born son)&rsquo; thou indeed excellest thy father, excellest thy grand father; he may attain the highest station by his prosperity, glory and spiritual eminence, who is born as a son of such &amp; brāhmaṇa that knows this&rdquo;.</p>
<p>It will be clear from the above passages of the Bs. Up. that the jātakarma rite contained the following parts: (1) homa of ourds with ghita to the accompaniment of mantras ; (2) repeat ing in the child&rsquo;s right ear the word &lsquo;speech&rsquo; thrice; (3) making the child liok curds, honey and gbrta by means of a</p>
<p>golden ladle (or ring); (4) addressing the child with a name which was to be his secret name (nāmakarana ); (5) putting the child to the breast; (6) addressing the mother with mantras. The Satapatha adds another detail viz. asking five brābmanas if available to breathe on the child (from four quarters, east, south, west, north and one immediately above him) or the father himself may do so.</p>
<p>There is great divergence in the grhyasūtras on the diffe rent details that go to make up the jātakarma. Some give almost all the above seven details, while others omit some of them. The order of these components differs in the grhyam sūtras and according to the Veda to which each sutra is attached the mantras differ. It would be impossible to give in a brief compass the details from all grbyasūtras. Some description, however, of the details from important gļhyasūtras is given below:</p>

<p>The ceremony has to be performed by the very necessities of the case immediately after birth. But different sūtras er. press it in differant ways, e. g. Aśv. I. 15. 2 says the rite should be done before any other person (than the mother and nurse ) touches the child. Pār. gr. ( I. 16 ) says it is performed before the navel string is cut off. Gobbila ( 11.-7. 17 ) and Khadira II. 2. 32 say that it is to be performed before the navel string is cut off and the breast is given to the child..</p>
<p>In the Asv. gr. (I. 15. 1-4) the ceremony is described as follows: &ldquo;When a son has been born, he (the father ) should before other persons touch him, give to the child to eat honey and olarified butter in which gold has been rubbed by means of a golden (spoon) with the verge &lsquo;I give unto thee the Veda ( wisdom or knowledge ) of honey and ghșta, ( Veda ) which is produced by the god Savitr ( who urges on) the bountiful; may you have long life and may you live in this world for a hund. red autumns being protected by the gods&rsquo;. Bringing near the child&rsquo;s two ears ( his mouth ) the father mutters medhajanana 589 *may god Savitr bestow on thee intelligence; may the goddess Sarasvati bestow on thee intelligence and may the two gode Aśvins wearing wreaths of lotus give to thee intelligence&rsquo;: 530 He touches the (son&rsquo;s ) two shoulders ( with the mantra ) be a etone, be an axe, be indestructible gold; thou art indeed Veda, called son; so live a hundred autumns&rsquo; and (with the mantra ) &lsquo;Oh Indra, bestow the best wealth&rsquo; (Rg. II. 21. 6 ) and &lsquo;Oh Maghavan (bountiful Indra ) | 51 Oh ( Indra) partaker of rjisa! bestow on us&rsquo; (R&amp;. III. 36. 10). And let them give him a name&rdquo;, The following sūtras ( I. 15. 5-10) lay down rules about the name, which will be considered under Nāmakarana,</p>

<li>The verse is zo bided because it was deemed to produce intelligence,</li>

<p>. 580. Narayana (on Aśv. gr. I. 15. 2) notes that some say that the mantra is muttered only once, when the mouth is brought near each car one after another, others say that the mantra is recited twice.</p>

<p>It will be noticed that out of the several co.oponents of the rite described in the Br. Up. and the Sat. Br., Asv. omits express mention of homa, of putting the child to the breast (stanadāna), the address to the mother (mātrabhimantrana ), and the brea thing over the child by five brāhmaṇas or the father. The Sān. gr. (I. 24. 1-12 ) also omits homa, the stanadāna and mātrabhi. mantrana, but refers to the father breathing over the new born child thrice. Instead of ghṛta and honey served with a golden spoon, Sān. prescribes mixing of ourds, honey, ghṛta and water or grinding together of rice and barley. It adds the tying of gold to &amp; hempen string and fixing it on the right hand of the child till the mother gets up from child-bed.</p>
<p>It will have been noticed that Aśv. and San. both prescribe giving a secret name to the child on the day of birth and do not prescribe a separate Nāmakaraṇa ceremony. Śān. gr. (1. 24. 6 ) adds that a vyāvahārika name inay be given on the 10th day from birth. The Gobhila gr. (II. 7. 13-15 ) and Khādira gr. II. 2. 28-31 say that a secret name for the child that is to be born is to be uttered in the Sosyanti-karma. 80 Āśv, probably carries on that tradition.</p>
<p>We shall now take the several components of the rite and show how they are dealt with by the several grhyasūtras.</p>
<p>Homa :-This is prescribed by the Br. Up., the Manava, the Kathaka gf. at the time of birth. The Asv. gr. pariśiṣta (1.26) says that home should be performed to Agni and other gods as stated above, then the child should be made to eat honey and gbpta and then the offering be made to Agni. It is prescribed before birth ( in the Sosyantikarma) by Gobhila and Khādira. It is prescribed after the whole rite by Baud. gr. II. 1. 13. It is omitted by Asy.and San, The Pār. gs. (1. 16), Hir. gr., Bharadvāja gr. (I. 26 ) say that the Aupāgana (i. e. gļhya ) fire is taken away and a sūtikāgni set up (which is also called Uttepaniya )532 near the door of the lying-in chamber. The Vaik. (III. 15 ) calls it jātakāgni (and also Uttapaniya ). These say that in this fire white mustard seed with small grains of rice are offered at the time of birth and at the morning and evening twilights for ten days after birth with certain mantras. Ap. proboribes that</p>

<p>Sanskūras-Jatakarma</p>
<p>mustard seeds and rice chaff are to be offered in the fire when. ever any body enters the lying-in chanıber for ten days.</p>
<p>(2) Medhājunana -Two meanings are given to tbis. This word does not ocour in the Bṛ, Up. But it speaks of muttering in the right ear of the boy the word &lsquo;vāk&rsquo; thrice and making the boy lick from a golden spoon or ring curds, honey and gbrta. The first of these viz. muttering in the right ear of the boy some words or a mantra is called medhājanana in Āśv. and Śan. (I. 24. 9 which prescribes &lsquo;vāk &lsquo;); while most of the other sūtras viz. Vaik., Hir., Gobhila say that medbājanana is the action of making the child eat honey, ghee, curds or pounded barley and rice, to the acoompaniment of mantras (like * bhūstvayi dadhāmi&rsquo; in Pār. or &lsquo;Bhūr rcaḥ&rsquo; as in Vaikbānasa, or &lsquo;medbām to devaḥ&rsquo;as in Ap.), The Baud. gr. (II. 1. 7) prescribes the giving of ourds, honey and ghșta ten times with each of the ten mantras ( Tai. Br. II. 5. 1) of the anuvāka beginning with &lsquo;prano rakṣati viāvam-ejat.&rsquo; The Vaik, expressly Bays that the Vacā 833 plant, Pathyā plant, gold, honey and clari fied butter become medhājanana. Manu II. 29 seizes upon the making the child eat gold ( dust ), honey and clarified butter to</p>
<p>the accompaniment of mantras as the central part of the rite. Later works like the Samskıramayākha regard this eating of honey and ghfta as the principal part of jātakarma. 534</p>
<p>(3) Ayuṣya Some of the sūtras speak of &amp; rite called Ayuṣya in the jātakarma. This consists in muttering over the navel ( as in Pār.) or in the right ear of the boy some mantra or mantras invoking the bestowal of long life on the boy. Aśv. ( vide p. 231 ) bas such an invocation in conjunction with the eating of honey and gbfta. Bhāradvāja also does the same. Manava gf. prescribes the anuvāka &lsquo;Agne āyur-asi&rsquo; ( Kathaka Sarn. XI. 7) for 21 oblations (this anuvāka is full of the word * 2yuṣmat&rsquo;).</p>
<p>(4) Amsābhimarsana ( touching the child on the shoulder or shoulders ). Vide Asv. above. Ap. begins his treatment with the direction that the father touches the boy with the Vatsapra anuvāka. Pār., Bhāradvāja speak of touching the boy twioe, once with Vātsapra anuvāka (Vāj. 8. XII. 18-29 or Tai, S. IV.</p>

<p>2.2), and again with be a stone, be an axe&rsquo;(in Par. and with the mantra &lsquo;may he grow&rsquo; in Bhār.). Some sūtras like Saó. omit this.</p>
<p>(5) Matrabhimantrana :-( addressing the mother). The mother is addressed by the father with the verse. Thou art Iļa &amp;o&rsquo; ( vide Bļ. Up, above), which occurs in Pār. Many sutras ounit this. Hir. has a different verse.</p>
<p>(6) Panoa-brāhmaṇasthāpana :-We saw above that the Satapatha prescribes the breathing over the child by five brāh manas or the father himself. Pār. prescribes the same and gives an option (the five brāhmanas are to repeat in order from the east prāṇa, vyāna, apāna, udāna and samāna ). Sān. asks the father bimself to breathe thrice over the boy with a verse referring to the three Vedas. Several sūtras omit this.</p>
<p>(7) Stana-pratidhāna or stanapradana:-making the child take the breast. The Br. Up. and many of the sūtras prescribe this, together with the recitation of a mantra or mantras e. g. Pār, prescribes Vāj. S. 17. 87 and 38.5 for the two breasts, Ap. and Bhār. prescribe Ap. mantrapatha II. 13. 2 only for the right breast ; Hir. and Vaik. prescribe the same verse for both.</p>
<p>(8) Desābhimantraña385 (or-marśana);touching the ground where the son is born and addressing the earth ( with one or two mantras ). Pār., Bhār., Ap., Hir. do this.</p>
<p>(9) Namakarana :-(giving a name to the child ). The Bṛ. Up., Āgv., Sān., Gobhila, Khadirs and several others speak of giving a name to the boy on the day of birth. Aśv. (I. 15. 4 and 10 ) presoribes the giving of two names on that date, one for common use (for which he gives elaborate rules) and the other a secret one which his parents only know till the boy&rsquo;s upanayang. San. reverses this and says the name for which similar elaborate rules are laid down by him is the secret name and a name for common use is to be given on the 10th day, Ap. gr. ( 15.2-3 and 8 ) says on the day of birth a name derived from the nakṣatra (lunar mansion) on which the boy is born is given, which is the secret name and then on the 10th another pame is to be given. According to Gobhila and Khādira a name is to be given in the Sosyanti-karma which is to be kept secret.</p>

<p>(10) Keeping off evil spirits :&ndash;Though Aøv. and san are entirely silent on this point several sutras devote large space to this topic and are full of mantras which are more are less magio. Ap. presoribes the offering of mustard seed and rice chaff in fire three times with each of eight mantras (Ap. pantra pātha II. 13. 7-14). Bhār. gr. (I. 23 ) also prescribes similar offerings with several verses. Hir. gr. requires the throwing of mustard seeds eleven times in the sūtikāgne with eleven mantras some of which are almost the same as in Bhāradrāja. Pār. gr. recites two of such mantras.528</p>
<p>It would not be out of place to mention a few other subsidiary matters. Baud., Ap., Hir. and Vaik. expressly say that the boy is to have a bath. The Hir, and Vaik, 537 say that the axe is to be placed on a stone and gold is to be placed on the axe, then these are to be turned upside down ( so that gold lies at the bottom and the stone is on top ) and then the boy is to be held head eastwards above the stone by a female in her two hands, while the father repeats the two mantras &quot; be a stone &amp;c.' and the mantra &lsquo;thou art produced from (my) limb by limb &amp;o.&rsquo; This shows how what was once only symbolical (viz. uttering the mantras &quot; be a stone' &amp;c. indicating the desire that the boy should be strong, sharp and worthy like a stone, axe and gold ) became transformed into &amp; rite requiring physical presence of these things. Par.. Ap., Hir., Bbār. and Vaik. prescribe that a pot full of water should be placed towards the head ( of the woman and her child) with a mantra &lsquo;Oh waters!</p>

<p>watch while (people are asleep). None of the sotras ( except Vaikhānasa ) refers to any astrological details. Vaik. (III. 14 ) gays that when the child&rsquo;s nose appears, the position of the planets should be observed and his future welfare or otherwise should be examined, since the boy is to be so brought up as to enhance his good qualities. Both Āp, and Baud, say that the remnants of honey, curds and ghrta should be mixed with water and poured out in a cowstable (and not thrown about in an impure place ). This ceremony is comparatively brief in Ap., Sān. and a few others, but in Hir., Par, and Bhāradvāja it is most elaborate and would require an unduly long time consi dering the state of the newly born child and the woman in child-bed. There is no wonder, therefore, that this ceremony gradually went out of vogue.. In modern times a few well-to-do families in Western India sometimes perform what is called &lsquo;putrāvana&rsquo; (in Marathi) and make the boy lick honey and ghfta by means of a golden piece or ring. The dangers to the child of an elaborate ritual must have been apparent to all people even in ancient times. 588</p>
<p>The Sm. O. (I. p. 19 )539 cites Hārita, Saṅkha, Jaimini to the effect that till the navel cord is out there is no impurity, that the saṁskāra may be performed till then and that gifts of jaggery, sesame, gold, clothes, cows and corn may be made and accepted. The same work quotes Samyarta and other smṛtis to the effect that the father must bathe before he can perform the jātakarma rite. This would involve some further loss of time and it is remarkable that the grhy&amp; sūtras observe silence about this, though Manu V. 77 prescribes a bath on hearing of the birth of a son, The Sm. C. quotes Pracetas, Vyāsa and others to the effect that a nāndiśrāddha ( whioh will be explained under srāddha ) should be performed in jātakarma ( brāhmanas are not to eat cooked food in this srāddha, but to receive corn or only money payment). Later works like the Dharmasindhu say that in jātakarma as in other rights, svastivāoana, punyābą. vācana and mātrkāpūjana are necessary.</p>

<p>Medieval writers of digests give extensive descriptions of sānti rites 540 performed to counteract the inauspiolous effoots of birth on the 14th tithi of the dark half of a month or on the amāvāsya or on Mūla, Asleṣā and Jyeṣthā nakṣatras and certain astrological conjunctions like Vyatipāta, Vaidhfti, Sarnkranti (sun&rsquo;s passage from one sign of the zodiac into another). These matters are passed over here for want of space, as of little importance in modern times and as new departures introduced in the ancient sutra rites by later works. A few general remarks will be made on these matters in the section on Śanti and Muhurta.</p>
<p>In modern times on the 5th and 6th days after birth certain ceremonies are performed for which there is no warrant in the sūtras. These probably arose in the times of the Puranas, sinoe the only verses quoted on this point in the Nirnayasindhu, the Samskāramayukha and other works are the Mārkandeyapurāṇa, Vyāsa and Nārada. On these days the father or other male relative bathes in the first part of the nigbt, then invokes Ganesa, and certain minor deities called Janmadā on handfuls of rice and also Şaṣthidevi and Bhagavati ( i. e. Durgā) and worships them with sixteen upacāras. Then tāmbia and dakṣinā are offered to one or more brāhmaṇas and the members of the family keep awake that night with songs (in order to ward off evil spirits). One text from the Mārkandeyapurāns Bays&rsquo;men fully armed should keep watch the whole night&rsquo;. It must be noted here that fear springing from astrological considerations got bettor of even natural love and affection to such an extent that some writers advised that the child when born on certain inauspicious conjunctions should be abandoned and its face should not be seen till at least its eighth year, Vide Nityacārapaddbati pp. 244-255.</p>
<p>Utthana getting up from child-bed). According to Vaik, III. 18 on the 10th or 12th day after birth, the father shaves, bathes, purifies the house, performs in the jātakāgni ( or in the ordinary fire, according to some) a sacrifice to the earth through some person belonging to another gotra. Then he brings back the aupāgana (gṛbya fire), offers oblations to Dhāts and others (as in l. 16), five oblations to Varuna (I. 17), the mūlahoma (I. 18 ) and feeds the brahmanas. San. gs. (I, 25 ) is more elaborate. It pre scribes that a mess of cooked food is prepared in the sūtikagni</p>

<p>and oblations are made to the tithi of the child&rsquo;s birth, and to three nakṣatras and to their presiding deities, two to Agni and then one (i. e. 10th ) to Soma with Rg. I. 91.7. Hir. gs. IL 4. 6-9 (S. B. E. vol. 30 p. 214 ) and Bhāradvaja (I. 26 ) also refer to utthāna, Both say that the sūtikāgni is taken away and the Aupāsana fire is brought in and oblations of gbṛta ( 12 or 8) are offered in that fire with the mantras beginning with dhātā dadātu no rayim&rsquo;.</p>

<p>There is great divergence of view as to the time when the ohild was named. Several times are suggested in the ancient literature and in the gūtras and smrtis.</p>
<p>(a) We have already seen (p. 232 ) that a child was addressed by a name, according to Gobhila and Khādira, even in the Sosyantikarma.</p>
<p>(6) According to the Bṛ. Up., Aśv. and Sān., Kathaka gf. (34.1) a name was given to the child on the day of birth. &ldquo;This praotice is supported by a passage of the Sat. Br. Sala therefore when a son is born ( the father ) should bestow on him a name; thereby he drives away the evil that might attach to the boy ; ( the father gives himn) even a second, oven &amp; third ( name)', The Mahābhāsya of Patañjali appears to refer to this view. &ldquo;In the world the parents give a name to the son when born in a closed space (or room ) such as Devadatta, Yajñadatta; from their employment ( of that name for the boy ) others also come to know this is his appellation'&rdquo;. 548</p>

<p>(c) Ap., Baud., Bhar., and Par. prescribe the 10th day after birth for namakarana. The Mabābhāṣya quotes a passag8848 from the Yajnikas that a name was given on a day after the tenth from birth.</p>
<p>(d) Yaj. I. 12 prescribes it on the 11th day after birth.</p>
<p>(e) Baud. gr. (II. 1. 23 ) says that Namakarana may be performed on the 10th or 12th, while Hir. gr. says that it should be on the 12th. As Vaik. prescribes that the mother should get up from ohild-bed on the 10th or 12th and then speaks of nāmakarana, it follows that the ceremony was performed accord ing to it on the 10th or 12th. Manu 11.30 says it may be performed on the 10th or 12th day after birth or on an auspicious tithi, muhurta and nakṣatra thereafter.</p>
<p>(f) Gobbila (II. 8. 8, S. B. E. vol. 30. p. 57 ) and Khādira 5* say that it should be on any day after ten oights, one hundred nights or a year from birth. Laghu-Aśvaldyana (V1.1) allows it on 11th, 12th or 16th day. Aparārka (p. 26 ) quotes gļhyaparis iṣta to the effect that it may be performed after the 10th night is passed or after 100 nights or a year and the Bhaviṣyat-purana to the effect that it may be performed after 10 or 12 nights or on the 18th day or after a month. It is worthy of note that Bāṇa in his Kadambari ( pūrvabhāga para 68 ) says that Tārāpida named his son Candrāpida when the tenth day after birth fell on an auspicious muhurta and that the minister Sukanāsa named his son Vaiśampāyana next day. 545</p>
<p>The commentators were bewildered by these differences, Visvarūpe explains Manu II. 30 as &lsquo;when the 10th night is past&rsquo; and Kullūka does the same ( i. e. Bocording to him it is performed on the eleventh day). Medhātithi does not 546 like the addition of &lsquo;past&rsquo; (atitāyām) after &lsquo;dasamyam ' in Manu II. 30 and says just as jātukarma can be performed even when there is impurity due to birth, so nāmakarana may be performed on the 10th and that the only essential thing is that it is not to</p>

<p>be performed before the 10th or 12th. Aparārka says that there is an option and one may follow one&rsquo;s own grhyasūtra. It appears that the nāmakarana 547 of Hariscandra, son of Jayat candra, king of Kanoj, took place three weeks after jātakarma (on 31. 8. 1175 A. D.). In modern times nāmakaraña generally takes place on the 12th day after birth and no Vedio ceremony as prescribed in the sūtras is gone through, but women assemble and after consulting the male members of the family beforeband announce the name and place the child in the oradle.</p>
<p>In Rg. VIII. 80. 9 we read &lsquo;when you give us a fourth name connected with (the performance of ) a sacrifice, we long for it; immediately afterwards, you, our master, take us &lsquo;(for ward to glory ) 54% This shows that a man could have a fourth name even in the times of Rg. and the fourth was a name due to the performance of a yajña. Sāyaṇa explains that the four names are: nakṣatranāma ( derived from the nakṣatra on which a person was born ), a secret name, &amp; publicly known name and a fourth name like Sumayāji (due to having performed a Somayāga ). In Ry. X. 54. 4 there appears to be a reference to four names (though Sāyana takes nāma here to mean thaven</p>
<p>tra, even or deed). In Rg. IX. 75. 2 there is reference to a la</p>
<p>the son has a third name unknown to the parents and the in the bright part of heaven&rsquo;. The two names are the mostra name and the ordinary name, while the third would be the name due to the performance of a sacrifice (which the parents could not foresee at his birth). In the Rg. frequent reference is made to the secret name of a person. Vide Rg. IX 87. 3, X. 55. 1-2. We saw above ( note 541a ) that the Sat. Br. speaks of a second or even a third name for a person given to him by his parents. The same Brāhmaṇa 5*recommends &ldquo;Therefore a brāhmaps</p>

<p>when he does not prosper should give himself &amp; second name&rsquo;. But how these names were formed is not stated anywhere in the Vedic literature. In the Tai. S. VI. 3. 1.3 it is said therefore a brābmaṇa who has two names prospers &lsquo;. $50 The Sat. Br. (II. 1. 2. 11 ) gays Arjuna is the secret name of Indra and the constellation of Phālgūuis being presided over by Indra they are really Arjunyaḥ, but are called Phālgunyaḥ in an indirect way:55? We saw above (p. 230) that the Bļ, Up. speaks of a secret name given by the father on the day of birth. Hardly apy secret names are expressly mentioned in the Vedio literature except the name of Arjuna given to Indra (and being secret they cannot be expected to be mentioned). How the secret name was given is not clear from the Vedic literature. In Vāj. 8. 17. 89 there is a reference to the secret name of ghrta 568 The Tal. 8. gives expression to the request that the (dhavaniya); fire should bear the name of one who keeps sacred fires, while the person</p>
<p>praying was away on a journey &ldquo;63.</p>
<p>A few examples of the three names of a person from the Vedio literature may be given here. These are generally the ordinary name, a name derived from his father and a third from his gotra ( or from the name of some remote ancestor). In Rg. V. 33. 8 we find Trasadasyu ( his own name), Paurukutsya ( son of Purukutsa), Gairikṣita (descendant of Girikṣita ). In the Ait. Br. ( 33.5) Sunah epa is spoken of as Ajigarti ( son of AjIgarta ) and also as Angirasa (a gotra name ), while king Harigoandra is mentioned ( Ait. Br. 33, 1 ) as Vaidhasa ( son of Vedhas ) and Aikṣvāka ( descendant of Ikṣvāku ). In the Sat. Br. (XIII.5.4.1) Indrota Daivāpa ( son of Devāpi) Saunaka (&amp; gotra name) is said to have been the priest of Janamejaya. In the Chan. Up.(V. 3. 1 and 7) Svetaketu Aruneya (son of Aruni) is styled Gautama (a gotre name). In the Kathopaniṣad</p>

<p>Usually however a person is referred to in the Vedio literature by two names. In some cases it is his own name and a gotra nane 0. g. Medbyātithi Kāṇva (Rg. VIII. 2. 40), Hiranyastūpa Angirasa (Rg. X. 149.5), Vatsapri Bhālandana (Tai. 8. V. %. 1. 6), Bālāki Gārgya ( Bṛ. Up. II. 1.1), Cyavana Bhārgava ( Ait. Br. 39.7). In other cases &amp; man is referred to by his own name and another name derived from a country or locality e. g. Kasu Caidya (Rg. VIII.5.37), Bhima Vaidarbha ( Ait. Br. 35. 8), Durmukha Pañcala ( Ait. Br. 39. 23), Janaka Vaideha ( Br. Up. III. 1. 1), Ajātasatru Kābya (Br. Up. II. 1. 1), In some cases a matronymio is added to a person&rsquo;s name e. g. Dirgbatamā Māmateya (Rg. I. 158. 6), Kutga Arjuneya ( son of Arjuni, Rg. IV. 26. 1, VII, 19. %, VIII. 1. 11 ), Kaksivat Ausija (son of a woman called Usik, Rg. I. 18. 1, Vāj. S. III. 28 ),*** Prahlada Kāyādbava (son of Kayādhū, Tai. Br. I. 5. 10), Mahidāsa Aitareya ( son of Itarā, Chān. Up. III. 16.7). In the vamsa added at the end of the Br. Up. there are about forty sages with matronymio names. The practice of mentioning &amp; man by reference to his mother&rsquo;s name or to his mother&rsquo;s father&rsquo;s gotra was continued till later times, as will be shown later on. The most usual method, however, of referring to a person in the Rg. and also in other Vedic works was to state his name along with another derived from his father&rsquo;s, name. For example, Ambariṣa, Rjrāśva, Sahadeva and Surādhas are all called Vārṣāgira ( son of Vrṣagir, Rg. I. 100. 17 ); king Sudās is called Paijavana ( son of Pijavana, Rg. VII. 18. 22), Deyāpi is Arṣtiṣena ( son of Rṣtiṣena, Rg. X. 98. 5-6), Samyu Bārhaspatya (Tai. 8. II. 6. 10), Burgu Vāruṇi (Ait. Bṛ, 13. 10 and Tai. Up. III. 1), Bharata Dauṣṣanti (Satapatha XIII. 5. 4. 11, Ait. Bṛ, 39. 9), Nābhānediṣtha Mānava ( Ait. Br. 22, 9).</p>
<p>The principal rules about names may now be set out from the gphyasūtrag. Asv. ( I. 15. 4-10, S. B, E. vol. 29, pp. 182-183 ) Bays &lsquo;Let (them) give the boy a name beginning with a sonant, having a semivowel in it, with a visarga at the end, consisting of two syllables or of four syllables, of two syllables if (the father) is desirous of firm (worldly ) position ( for his son ), of four syllables if he is desirous of spiritual eminence (for his son );</p>

<p>and all the</p>

<p>Sanskaras-Namakarana</p>
<p>245</p>
<p>but (in all cases ) with an even number of syllables in the case of males and with an uneven number of syllables in the case of women. And let him find out (for the boy ) a name to be employed at respectful salutations ( at Upanayana &amp;c.); that name ( the boy&rsquo;s ) mother and father alone should know till his upanayana &ldquo;555. The Sān. gr. (S. B. E. vol. 29. p. 50) omits the rule about the name ending in a visarga and allows an option of six syllables and adds that the name should be formed by a kft affix ( from a root) and not by a taddhita; that this name should be known only to his parents and that on the tenth day after birth the father should give the child a name for ordinary use which should be pleasing to brāhmaṇas. It should be noticed that Asy, and Sān. differ on one very important point. According to AŚy, the name for which elaborate rules are laid down is to be the ordinary name and he lays down no rule about the forma. tion of the secret name; while Sān. lays down for the secret name the same rules as Asy, does for the public one and San. Bays about the public name that it should be pleasing.</p>
<p>Instead of quoting gļhya sūtras at length the principal rules about names deducible from them may be stated in the form of propositions with a few illustrations for each.</p>
<p>(1) The first rule in almost all gūtras is that the name for males should contain two or four syllables or an even number. This rule is deduced from Vedic literature where most of the names contain either two syllables (e. g. Baka, Trita, Kutsa, Bhṛgu) or four syllables (Trasadasyu, Purukutsa, Medhyatithi, Brahmadatta &amp;c.), though names of three bylla. bles (like Kavaṣa, Cyavana, Bharata ) and of five syllables</p>

<p>(like Nābhānediṣtha, Hiranyastupa ) are not wanting. Baija vāpass grhya allowed the name to be of one, two, three, four or any number of syllables. Sān, allowed a name even of six syllables and Baud. gr. ( II. 1. 25 ) of six or even eight. Exam ples of names with two syllables and four syllables are given below.</p>
<p>(2) Almost all gphyą sutras contain the rule that the name should begin with a sonant and contain in the middle a semitowel. This is stated also in the ancient quotation from Yājõikas in the Mahābhāṣya.</p>
<p>(3) Some sūtras prescribe that the name should end in a visarga preceded 557 by a long vowel (e. g. Ap., Bhār., Hir., Pār.). Āśv. only mentions that it should end in a visarga, while Vaik. and Gobhila say that it may end in a long vowel or in a visarga.</p>
<p>These rules were probably based on such Vedic names as Sudās, Dirghatamas, Pștbusrayas ( that occur in the Rgveda ) and such names as Vatsapri ( Tai, S. V. 2. 1. 6).</p>
<p>(4) Ap. prescribes that the name should have two parts, the first being a noun and the second a verbal formation ( generally a past passive participle). This rule is probably based on such ancient names as Brabmadatta ( wbich occurs in Bṛ. Up. I. 3. 24 and figures very much in Pali works ), Devadatta, Yajñadatta &amp;c.</p>
<p>(5) Many grbya sūtras (like Pār., Gobhila, san., Baija vāpa, Vārāba ) say that the name should be formed from a root by a kft affix and should not be a taddhita (i, e. formed from a noun by an affix ).</p>
<p>(6) Ap. and Hir, say that the name should have the upasarga&rsquo;su&rsquo; in it as a Brāhmana passage says that such a name has stability in it. Examples are Sujata, Sudarsana, Sukeśas ( Praśna Up. I. 1).</p>

<p>243</p>
<p>(7) Baud. gr. prescribes that the name may be derived froin a gage or a deity or an ancestor.558 The Mānava grhya, how. ever, forbids the giving of a name of a deity itself, but allows the giving of a name derived from the name of a deity or a nakṣa tra. Examples of names derived from sages would be Vāsistba, Nārada &amp;o, and of names taken from deities would be Viṣnu, Śiva &amp;o. The Mit, on Yāj. I. 12 quotes a passage of Sarkha that the name should be connected with one&rsquo;s family deity. It should be noticed that in modern times most names in many parts of India are the names of deities or of heroes supposed to be avatāras of deities. In Vedic literature hardly any human being bears the name of any of the Vedic gods (Indra, Mitra, Pūṣan &amp;c). There are only a few exceptions such as that of Bbrgu ( in Tai. Up. III. 1 ) who is said to have learnt from his father called Varuna and in the Praśna Up. (I. 1) there is Sauryāyaṇi Gārgya whose name is derived from Sūrya. But in the Vedic Literature persons have names derived from the names of gods, such as Indrota ( Indra +ūta, protected ), Indradyumna. The names that occur in the Mahābhāṣya such as Devadatta, Yajñadatta, Vāyudatta (vol. II. p. 296 ), Viṣnumitra ( vol. I. pp. 41 and 359), Bphaspatidattaka (or Bphaspatika ), Prajāpati. dattaka (or-patika), Bhanudattaka (or Bhānuka) and others set out in the Mahābhāsya ( vol. II. p. 425 ) exemplify the rule of the Mānavagrhya. It is difficult to say when the very names of deities began generally to be borne by human beings. Probably the practice began in the first centuries of the Christian era. From the fifth century onwards we have historio examples of such names, 6. g. in the Eran stone inscriptions of Budha gupta dated in the Gupta samvat 165 i. e. 484-5 A, D, (Gupta Inscriptions No. 19 ) there is a brāhmaṇa Indra-Visnu, son of Varuṇa-Viṣnu, son of Hari-Viṣnu.</p>
<p>(8) Baud., Pār., Gobhila (and the Yājñikas quoted by the Mahābhāsya ) prescribe that the name of the boy may be the same as that of any of the ancestors of the father. The Mānava gr. (I, 18 ) expressly says that the father&rsquo;s own name should not be given. This practice was observed in ancient times and continues even today, when the child is often given his grand father&rsquo;s name,559 Vide I. A. vol. VI. p. 73 where we see that Pulakesi II was grandson of Pulakesi I.</p>

<p>(9) The gļhyasūtras (except Pār. and Manava) are agreed that &amp; secret name is to be given to the boy by the parents, in the Sosyantikarma according to Gobhila and Khadira, at birth accord ing to some (like Aśv. and Kathaka) and according to others like Āp., Baud., Bhār.) at the time of Nāmakarana on 10th or 12th day. We saw above that Sān. and Kathaka give elaborate rules about the secret name, which rules are those of the Vyavahā. rika 580 name according to Aśv, and many other sūtrakāras. Gobhila and Khādira give no rules about the secret name. Ap., Hir. and Vaik, only say that the secret name should be derived from the nakṣatra of birth, but give no further rules. Bhāra dvāja 58&rsquo; speaks of the giving of two names in Nāmakarana, one being derived by applying the intricate rules described above and the other being a nakṣatra name; but it is not quite clear which was to be the secret&rsquo; name; it is probable, however, that the naksatra name was to be the secret one. According to A$va lāyana the secret name was called Abhivādaniya ( which was to be known to the parents only till the boy&rsquo;s upanayana and which was to be used by the boy for announcing bimself in respectful salutations ); but he does not say how it was to be derived.

<p>the gotra of the boy (ase.g. Gargya, Sandilya, Gautama &amp;c.). This practice is based on the usage we find in the Upaniṣads, where Satyakāma when about to go to &amp; teacher for Vedio study asks his mother what his gotra was (Chan, Up. IV.4.1) and where the teacher also asks him what his gotra was. In the Kathopaniṣad Naciketas is styled Gautama and in Chān. V. 3.7 Svetaketu is addressed as Gautama by Pravābana Jaivali when the latter expounded Samvarga-vidyā to the former. But if the abhivādaniya was a gotra name there could have been no secrecy. From Gobhila it appears that the ācārya told the boy his abhivadaniya name, but the Khadira suggests that the boy already knew it ( from his father or mother) and informed the toacher. The nakṣatranāma was of importance in the perform. ance of Vedic sacrifices. The Vedangajyotisa 563 (of the Rg) in verses 25-28 enumerates 28 nakṣatras ( adding Abhijit after Uttarāsādhā and before Sravana) and their presiding deities and adds that in sacrifices the sacrificer is to bear a name derived from the name of the presiding deity of his nakṣatre. The object of keeping the nakṣatra name secret seems to have been to prevent rites of abhicāra (magical practices ) against &amp;</p>

<p>person, for the effective employment of whioh it was necessary to know a person&rsquo;s name. 564</p>
<p>Hundreds of names oocur in the Vedio Literature, but there are hardly any names directly derived from &amp; nakṣatra. In the Sata patha (VI. 2. 1. 37 ) there is an Aṣādhi Sausromateya (son of Aṣadha and Susromata ). Here Aṣādha is probably connected with the nakṣatra Aṣadha. It appears therefore that in the times of the brahmanas pakṣatra names were secret and 80 are not met with. Gradually however nakṣatra names ceased to be secret and became common. For several centuries before the Christian era naksatra names were very common. Pāṇini (who cannot be placed later than 300 B. C. and may have flourished some centuries earlier still) gives several rules (IV. 3. 34-37 and VII. 3. 18) for deriving names of males and females from nakṣatras. In IV, 3. 34 he says that names are derived from Śraviṣthā, Phālguni, Anuradha, Svāti, Tiṣya, Punarvasu, Hasta, Aṣādha and Babula (Kșttikā) without adding any termination signifying &lsquo;born on&rsquo; (e. g. we have the names Sraviṣthaḥ, Phālgunaḥ &amp;c.). In VII.3.18 he derives the name Proṣthapadaḥ from Prosthapadā. In the Junagadh inscription of Rudradāman (150 A. D.) the brother-in-law of Candragupta Maurya is said to have been a vaisya named Puṣyagupta ( E. I. vol. VIIL. P. 43). This shows that in the 4th century B. O. &amp; name was derived from the naksatra Puṣya (80 the name was nakṣatrāśraya ). The Mahābhāṣya (vol. I. p. 231 ) speaks of boys named Tisya and Punarvasu and cites Citrā, Revati, Rohiṇi as names of women born on these nakṣatras (vol. II. p. 307 ) and of Caitra as &amp; male (vol. II. p. 128 ). The Mahābhāsya speaks of Puṣyamitra, the founder of the Śunga dynasty ( vol. I. p. 177, vol. II, pp. 34 and 123 ). Buddhists also had nakṣatra names 8. 8. Moggaliputta Tissa ( where &amp; gotra name and a nakṣatra name from Tiṣya are combined), a parivrājaka Potthapāda in Digha I. p. 187 and III. p. 1 (from the nakṣatra Proṣthapada ), Asāda, Phaguna, Svātiguta, Pusara khita and in the Sāñci inscriptions of 3rd century B. C. (E. I. ( vol. II. p. 95). The giving of nakgatra names continued for centuries after the Christian era. For example, in the Palitana plate of Dhruvagona I dated Valabhi samvat 210 (about 529 A. D.) there is a brāhmana named Viśākha. We have</p>

<p>names like Puṣyasyāmi, Rohinisyāmi ( in the plates of Sivarāja dated 602-3 A. D., in E. I. vol. IX. p. 288 ). Another way of deriving names from nakṣatras was to form them from the presiding deity of the nakṣatra on which a person was born. A man was called Agneya, if he was born on Kfttikā ( Agni being its devatā), Maitra (from being born on Anuradha ). In modern times this round-about way is given up and persons are named directly from the names of gods and avatāras (like Rāma).</p>
<p>There is another way of deriving names from nakṣatras set forth in medieval works on Dharmaśāstra and Jyotiṣa. Each of the 27 nakṣatras is divided into four pādas and to each pāda a specifio letter is assigned (e. g., cũ, ce, co and la for the pādas of Aspini) from which names are derived for persons born in those pādas (e. g. Cūdāmaṇi, Cedisa, Colesa and Lakṣmaṇa for the four pādas of Asyini ).Sos These names are secret and are even now muttered into the ear of the brahmaoārl in Upa na. yana and are known as the name in the dāily samdhyā prayer.</p>
<p>Modern works like the Samskāraprakāsa (p. 237 ) say that four kinds of names may be given viz. devatānāma, māsanāma, nakṣatranāma and vyāvahārikanāma. The first shows that the bearer is the devotee of that devatā. The Nirnayasindhu 566 quotes &amp; verse about twelve names derived from the month in which a man was born and adds that the Madanaratna laid down that the names specified in the verse were to be given to the months from Margaśirṣa or Caitra. Such names of Viṣṇu ) are being given now, particularly in Western India, but without regard to the month of birth. So early as in the Bșhatsambitā of</p>

<p>As to the names of girls, some special rules were laid down. Many grbyasūtras say that the names of girls should contain an uneven number of syllables and the Mānava gr. (I. 18 ) expressly says that the names of girls should be of three sylla bles. Pār. and Vārābagrhya further say that the names of girls should end in &lsquo;a&rsquo;, Gobhila and Mānava say they should end in &lsquo;da&rsquo; (as in Satyadā, Vasuda, Yasodā, Narmadā), Saṅkha-likhita dharmasutra and Baijayāpa require that it should end in &lsquo;l&rsquo;, while the Baud.588 gr. sesa-sutra says that it should end in a long vowel. The Vārāhagļhya adds an intricate rule that the name of a girl should have an &lsquo;a&rsquo; vowel in it and should not be after a river, a naksatra or should not be the name of the gun or moon or Pūṣan and should not be one having the idea of &lsquo;given by god&rsquo; as in Devadattā or having the word &lsquo;rakṣitā ( as in Buddharakṣitā ).569 Manu II. 33 prescribes that the names of women should end in a long vowel, should be easy to pronounce, should not suggest any harsh acts, should be perspicuous, should be pleasing to the ear, auspicious and should convey some bles sing and in III. 9 Manu and Ap. gr. III. 13 say that one should not marry a girl named after nakṣatras, trees, rivers. In modern times girls frequently bear the names of the great rivers of India ( Sindhu, Jāhnavi, Yamunā, Tāpi, Narmada, Goda, Krṣṇā, Kāveri &amp;c. ). .</p>
<p>It is remarkable that Manu altogether omits the involved rules given by the gṛhya sūtras about naming a boy and prescri bes ( II. 31-32 ) two simple rules viz. that the names of all the members of the four varnas should suggest respectively suspici ousness, vigour, wealth and lowness (or contempt) and that the names of brāhmaṇas and the other varnas should have an addition ( upapada ) suggestive of sarman (happiness ), rakṣa</p>

It is significant that none of the gļhya sūtras except Pāraskara 570 makes any reference to these additions ( śarman and the like) to the names of brāhmaṇas and others. Therefore this was comparatively &amp; later development, though such additions must have been in vogue at least two centuries before the Christian era. The Mahābhāgya s71 ( vol. III. P. 416 ) cites Indravarman and Indrapālita as the names of a rājanya and a vaisya. Yama quoted by Aparārka (p. 27 ) says 574 that the names of brāhmaṇas should have the addition of sarma or deva, of kṣatriyas varma or trūta, of vaisyas bhūti or datta, and of sūdras dāsa. Similar rules are given in the Purāṇas $73. These rules were sometime observed, but were often broken from very ancient times as inscriptions show. A striking example of the observance of these rules is contained in the Talgunda Inscription of Kakutsthavarman of the Kadamba family (E. I. vol. VIII. p. 24 ) where the founder who was a brāhmana is styled Mayūraśarman, but his descendants who were kings had names ending in varman ( which was appropriate to ksatriyas). On the other hand we have frequent breaches of these rules. In the Gupta Inscriptions No. 35 (C. I. I. vol. III, p. 150, at p. 156 the Mandasor Ins. of Yasodhar man of Malava year 589, 645-46 A. D.) the genealogy of the brāhmaṇa ministers is Şaṣthidatta, his son Varābadāsa, bis son Ravikirti (so the upapadas&rsquo; datta' and &lsquo;dāsa&rsquo; appropriate to vaisyas and sūdras respectively were added to brāhmana names ). In the Neulpur plate of Subhakara of Orissa ( 8th century A. D., E. I. vol. XV. p. 4) we have several bhattas whose names and in vardhana, datta and svāmin. In the Nidhanpura plate of Bhāskaravarman (E. I. vol. XIX p. 115 ) among the numerous donees (who must have been all brāhmānas) there are some who are named Srāddhadāsa, Karkadatta and Merudatta.

<p>of the year 60 (C. I. I. vol. II. P. 16 ) his father is called Valavadha (Balavardhana ) and his son Mitravadhana (Mitravardhana ).</p>
<p>A few words may be said about matronymics. A few examples of such names have been given above from Vedio Literature. Aøv. gr.574 (I. 5. 1.) says that in seleoting a bride groom or bride &ldquo;one should first examine the family, as has been already said &lsquo;those who on the mother&rsquo;s and father&rsquo;s side&rsquo;&rdquo;. This refers to the Aśv. Srauta sūtra where it is required that both parents of the brāhmaṇa at the time of camasabhakṣaṇa in Daśapoya should be for ten generations perfect in their learning, austerities, and meritorious works and who can be traced to have throughout been of the brāhmaṇa class on both sides &amp;o. Yāj. I. 54 enjoins that one should choose a girl from</p>
<p>&amp; great family of śrotriyas, which has been famous for ten generations (for learning and character ). Therefore when in certain cases a person is named after his mother or after the gotra of his mother&rsquo;s father, all that is intended to be conveyed is that he is descended from worthy male and female ancestors. There is no question in such cases of matriarchy. In the Nasik Inscription No. 2 (E. I. vol. VIII. p. 60) siri Puļumāyi is des cribed as Vāsithiputa and in E. I. vol. VIII. p. 88 the Abhira king Iśvarasena is described as Mādhariputra. 575 In a Scythian</p>
<p>Inscription ( E. I. vol. X at page 108 ) we have mention of the son of Bhargavi'. In all these cases the mother&rsquo;s gotra name is specially emphasized probably to convey that the mothers were of the bluest blood. Comparatively late writers mention the gotra in which their mother was born (e. g. Bhavabhūti who flourished about 700–750 A. D. says that he was a Kāøyapa while his mother was a Jātūkarṇi). From a Kārikā in the Mahābhāṣya we learn that the great grammarian Pāṇini was the son of a Dākṣi. Pāṇini himself 578 (IV. 1. 147 ) delivers a</p>

E. vol. 29, p. 52 ) prescribes that the father and mother (having bathed themselves and the child) should put on new clothes, that the father should cook a mess of food in the sūtikāgni, that he is to offer oblations to the tithi of the boy&rsquo;s birth and to three constellations with their presiding deities, that he is to place in the middle the oblation to the nakṣatra of birth and he should make two other oblations to fire with two mantras and then the 10th oblation is made to Soma with Rg. I. 91. 7. The father pronounces aloud the child&rsquo;s name and causes the brāhmaṇas to say auspicious words.</p>
<p>The Aśv. gr. does not describe Nāmakarana. Many of the other gļhyasūtras presoribe that the sūtikāgni is to be removed and the home for nāmakarana is to be performed in the Aupāsana ( gļhya) fire, The Bhāradvāja gr. 578 prescribes the repetition of the Jayā, Abhyātāna and Rāṣtrabhṛt mantras and the offering of eight oblations of ghrta with the eight mantras may Dhātr bestow on us wealth' (ĀP.M.P. II. 11. 1ff). The Hir. gr. ( II. 4. 6-14, S. B. E. vol. 30 pp. 214–215 ) contains similar rules. It prescribes twelve oblations with the mantras *may Dhāts bestow on us wealth' and gives two names &amp; secret naskatra name and an ordinary name) to the boy. The twelve oblations are as follows: four to Dhātr, four to Anu mati, two to Rākā, two to Sinivāli. According to some a thirteenth oblation to Kuhū was to be offered.</p>

<p>Some sūtra works udd &amp; detail immediately after Nāma karana. For example, Asv. gr. ( I. 15. 11 ) says &lsquo;when a father returns from &amp; journey he holds in his hands his son&rsquo;s head, mutters the verse &lsquo;angad angād &amp;c.&rsquo; and thrice smells (kisses) his son on the head. Ap. gr. 15. 12 580 prescribes that on returning from a journey the father should address his son (abbimantraña) with the verse angad,&rsquo; should smell the child on the head with the verge &lsquo;be thou an axe&rsquo; and should mutter in his right ear five mantras. These rules have a very ancient origin. The Kauṣitaki Br. Up. II. 11 says that on returning from a journey the father touches the head of a son with the verse &lsquo;angād-angad &amp;o.&rsquo; and takes the name of the boy and also repeats the verge * aśmā bhava' &amp;o. In the case of the girl there is no smelling of the head nor muttering in the ear, but only address ( with a prose formula). This no doubt indicates that greater value was attached to a son than to a daughter, but it also shows that the daughter was not altogether neglected.</p>

<p>Niṣkramana:(Taking the child out of the house in the open). This is a minor rite. Pār. gṛ. I. 17 gives the briefest description. Vide also Gobhila II.8.1-7 (S. B.

According to Par. gr. the fatber makes the ohild 584 look at the sun pronouncing the verge &lsquo;that eye&rsquo; (Vaj. S. 36. 24).

<p>gr. (IL.) prescribes a homa with eight oblations. Gobhlla speaks of candradarsana. It says that on the 3rd tithi of the third bright fortnight after birth, the father bathes the child in the morning, worships in the evening the moon with folded hands, then the mother, having dressed the child, hands it with its face to the north from the south to north to the father and herself passes behind the back of the father and stands to the north of him, who worships with the three verses 585 &lsquo;Oh thou whose hair is well parted, thy heart&rsquo; (Mantrabrahmana I. 5. 10–12 ), then the father hands back the son to the mother with the words that this son may not come to harm and be torn from his mother'. Then in the following bright fortnights, the father filling his joined hands with water and turning his face towards the moon, lets the water flow out of his joined hands once with the Yajus &lsquo;what is the moon&rsquo; (Mantrabrāhmaṇa I. 5. 13 ) and twice silently. The Khādiragphya bas practically the same rules, except that it does not speak of two times. It will be noted that both omit tbe sight of the sun, but only mention the seeing of the moon. Laghu-Aśvaldyana VII. 1-3 speaks of the performance of abhyudayika sraddha, then reciting the sūkta from svasti no mimitam' (Rg. V. 51, 11 ) and &lsquo;āśu siśanaḥ&rsquo; (Rg. X. 103. 1), showing the boy to the sun in the courtyard of one&rsquo;s father-in-law or in that of another and then repeating the verse &lsquo;that eye&rsquo; (Vaj. 8. 36. 24). The Sm. O. remarks that those in whose sākhā this rite is not mentioned need not perform it. The Samskāraprakāśa pp. 250-256 and Sarakararatnamālā pp. 886-888 give an extensive description and make of this samskāra a matter of great pomp, festivity and rejoicing. Yama 588 quoted in Sam, Pr. says that seeing the sun and seeing the moon should be done respectively in the 3rd and 4th months from birth.</p>

<p>month from birth as the time for this samakāra; but Mānava gf. says it may be the 5th or 6th ; while Saṅkha quoted by Aparārka says it should be performed at the end of a year or at the end of six months, according to some 587. The Kathaka gr. enjoins the sixth month from birth or the time when the child first strikes teeth. The procedure is very brief in all except Śān, and Pār, Sān. says that the father should prepare food of goat&rsquo;s flesh, or flesh of partridge, or of fish or boiled rice, if he is desirous of nourishment, holy lustre, swiftness or splendour respectively and mix one of them with ourds, boney and ghee and should give it to the child to eat with the reciting of the Mahāvyābśtis ( bhūḥ, bhuvaḥ, svaḥ). Then the father is to offer oblations to fire with four verses &lsquo;Annapate&rsquo;, 588 Rg. IV. 12. 4-5 and &lsquo;him, Oh Agni, lead to long life and splendour &amp;o&rsquo;. The father recites over the child the verse Rg. IX. 66. 19 and then sets down the child on northward pointed kusa grass with Rg. I. 22. 15. The mother is to eat the remnant of the food thus prepared. Aśv. has almost the same rules as to food (omitting fish ) but prescribes only one verse &lsquo;Annapate&rsquo;. Ap. gr. 589 prescribes feeding of brāhmaṇas, making them give benedictions to the child and then making the child eat only once amess of curds, honey, ghee and boiled rice mixed together, with the recitation of a mantra joined to the three vyābftis singly and collectively and says that according to some the flesh of partridge may also be added. Bhār, says that the method of making a child eat is the same as in Medhājanana and is silent about the food. Pār. gr. (I. 19 ) prescribes the cooking of sthālīpāke and offering the two ajyabhāgas and then two offerings of ghee with the mantras &lsquo;the gods generated 590 the goddess of speech &amp;o &lsquo;(Rg. VIII. 100. 11 ) and the verse &lsquo;may vigour to-day produce for us gifts &amp;c&rsquo;(Vāj. S. 18. 33 ). Mānava, Kathaka and Vaik. are entirely silent about flesh. Kāthaka</p>

<p>It will be seen from the above that the principal part of the samskāra is making the child taste food. Some writers add home, feeding of brāhmaṇas, and benedictions. The Samskara prakāśa (pp. 267-279 ) and Samskāraratnamālā (pp. 891-895) have very detailed notes on this samskāra. One interesting matter quoted by Aparārka (p. 28 ) from Mārkandeya is that on the day of this ceremony, in front of the gods worshipped in the house, tools and utensils required in various arts and crafts, weapons and sāstras should be spread about and the child should be allowed to crawl among them and what the child seizes at first should be noted and it should be deemed that he is destined to follow that profession for his livelihood which is represented by the thing first touched by him.</p>
<p>Varṣavardhana or abdapūrti:«In some of the sūtras provi. sion is made for some ceremonies every month on the day of the birth of the child for one year and on every anniversary of the day of birth throughout life. For example, Gobbila gr. ( II. 8. 19-20 ) says every month of the boy&rsquo;s birth for one year or on the parva days of the year he should sacrifice to Agni and Indra, to Heaven and Earth and to the Visve devas. Having sacrificed to these deities be should sacrifice to the tithi and nakṣatra &lsquo;.$02 The Sān. gr. (1. 25. 10-11 S. B, E, vol. 29, p. 52) similarly says&rsquo;having sacrificed in the same way every month on the tithi of the child&rsquo;s birth, he sacrifices when one year has expired in the (ordinary ) domestic fire&rsquo;. Baud. gr. III. 7598 prescribes an offering of cooked rice for life (āyuṣyacaru) &lsquo;every year, every six months, every four months, every season or every month on the nakṣatra of birth&rsquo;.

<p>flesh of a goat and sheep to Agni and Dhanvantari and feeding the brāhmaṇas with food mixed with plenty of ghee. Vaik. III. 20-21 speaks at great length of the ceremony called * Varṣavardhana&rsquo; ( increase of the years of a person) to be performed on the anniversary of the birth-day every year and lays down that in this rite the deity of the nakṣatra on which a child is born is the principal one, that oblations of ghee are to be offered to that deity and naksatra and then to the other presiding deities of the nakṣatras and to the nakṣatras them selves, then an oblation with the vyābști (bhūḥ svāhā ), then offerings to Dhātā. It describes in detail how different cere monies are to be performed up to Upanayana, then up to finishing of Veda study, how ceremonies are to be performed on the anniversary day of one&rsquo;s marriage, on the nakṣatra on which a person performed solemn sacrifices like Agnistoma and that if he thus lives till 80 years and 8 months he becomes one who has seen a thousand (full) moons and is called &lsquo;brahma sarfra &lsquo;, in celebration of which several ceremonies are pres cribed ( which for want of space are not set out here ). In connection with the anniversary of the marriage day, 594 Vaik. specially prescribes that whatever ceremonies women direct as done traditionally should be performed. Aparārka (p. 29 ) quotes verses of Mārkandeya to the effect that all should every year on the day of birth celebrate a festival (mahotsava ) in which one should honour and worship one&rsquo;s elders, Agni, gods, Prajāpati, the pitrs, one&rsquo;s nakṣatra of birth and brābmanas, The Kṛtyaratnākara (p. 540 ), the Nitgādārapaddhati (pp. 621-624 ) quote the same verses (as Aparārka does ) and add that on that day one should worship Mārkandeya (who is believed to be immortal) and the seven other cirajivins,595 The Nityācārapaddhati (p. 621 ) quotes a verse that in the case of kings the.anniversary of the day on which they were crowned should be delebrated.

<p>this festival&rdquo; abdapūrti&rsquo;. The Samakāraratananālā contains a very extensive discourse on this rite (pp. 877-886 ) and calls this festival ayurvardhāpena&rsquo;. The Nirnayasindhu and tbe Samskāraratnamālā set out the verses that are addressed to Mārkandeya and others. In modern times women do calobrate overy month the birthday of a child and the first anniversary of birth. They make the child cling to the principal house-post or to the post used for churning out butter from the pail of ourds and water.</p>
<p>Caula or Cudākarma or Cūdakarana :-( the first cutting of the hair on the cbild&rsquo;d head). This samskāra is mentioned by every writer. &lsquo;Cūdā&rsquo; means the &lsquo;lock or tuft of hair kept on the head when the remaining part is shaved (i, e. the sikha ); $0 cūdākarma or cūdākaraṇa means that rite in which a lock of hair is kept ( for the first time after birth ). We get cauda&rsquo; from &lsquo;cūdā &lsquo;586 meaning &lsquo;a rite the purpose of which is keeping a look of hair&rsquo; and &lsquo;da&rsquo; and &lsquo;la&rsquo; often interchange places. So we get&rsquo; cauda &lsquo;or&rsquo;caula&rsquo; also as the name of the ceremony.</p>
<p>According to many 597 writers caula was performed in the third year from birth. Baud. gr. (II. 4), Pār. gr. (II. 1), Manu II. 35, Vaik. III, 23 say that it may be performed in the 1st or 3rd year: Asv. gr. and Vārāba gr. say it may be performed in the 3rd year or in the year in which it is the custom of the faniily to perform it. Pār. also refers to family usage. Yāj. specifies no year, but mentions only family usage. Yama quoted by Aparārka (p. 29 ) allowed it in the first, 2nd or 3rd year, while Saṅkha-Likbita allowed it in the 3rd or 5th ( Aparārka p. 29 ), Şad-guru-sisya quoted in the Samskāraprakāśa (p. 296 ) and Nārāyaṇa (on Āśv. gr. I. 17,1) say that some per formed it at the time of upanayana.</p>

<p>Sanskaras-Caula</p>
<p>261</p>
<p>Whether such a ceremony was performed in the Vedio ages cannot be ascertained with certainty. Bhār, gr. I. 28 expressly 5*8 refers to the Vedio verse ( Rg IV. 75. 17 or Tai. S. IV, 6. 4. 5) as indicative of the practice of Caula in Vedic times where arrows fall together like boys having many tufts of hair&rsquo;. Manu II. 35 also has in view this Vedic verse,</p>
<p>The principal act in this ceremony is the cutting of the hair of the obild. The other subsidiary matters are the performance of homa, feeding of brābmaṇas, receiving of their benedictions and giving of dakśiṇā, the disposal of cut hair in such a way that no one can find them.</p>
<p>The ceromony is to be performed on an auspicious day as set out in note 494 above. Ap. gr. 16, 3 says it should be per formed when the moon is in conjunction with Punarvasu nakṣatra, while Mānava gr. says that it should not be done on the 9th tithi of a month. Later works like the Samskāraprakāśa (pp. 299-315 ) give very intricate rules about the auspiciou 8 times, which rules are passed over here. The most exhaustive treatment of this ceremony in the sūtra works is to be found in Aśv., Gobhila, Vārāha 4 and Pār. II. 1.</p>
<p>The materials required in this ceremony are stated as follows:-(1) To the north of the fire are placed four vessels each of which is separately filled with rice, barley, māṣa beans and sesame respectively ( Aśv. gr. I. 17.2 ), but Gobbila (II. 9. 6-7) says that they are to be placed to the east and Gobhila and Sān. say that these are to be given to the barber at the end of the rite ; (2) to the west of the fire the mother with the boy on her lap is to be seated and two vessels one filled with the dung of a bull and the other with sami leaves are to be also placed to the west ( Gobbila II. 9.5 and Khādira II. 3. 18 place the dung to the north of the fire and Khādira says that she sits to the north ); (3) to the right of the mother the father sits holding 21 bunches 599 of kusa grass or the brahmā priest (if there be any) may hold them; (4) warm and cold water or only warm water; (5) an ordinary razor or one made of Udumbara wood ( according to Khādira II. 3. 17 and Gobhila II. 9. 4);(6) a</p>

According to Gobhila and Khādira the barber, hot water, mirror, razor and bunches of kusa grass are to the south of the fire and bull&rsquo;s dung and a mess of rice mixed with sesame are to the north of the fire. Āśv., Pār., Kathaka and Mānava say that the rezor is to be of loha ( which the commentator Nārāyana explains as copper).</p>
<p>After home is performed, the principal matter (of cutting the hair) is to be begun. According to Gobbila and Khādira the father, having contemplated upon Savit;, looks at the barber with the mantra &lsquo;here comes Savitr&rsquo; (Mantra-br. I. 6. 1) and contem plating on Vāyu looks at the warın water with the mantra&rsquo; with warm water, Oh Vāyu, come hither&rsquo;( Mantra-Br. I. 6, 2). The father then mixes the hot and cold water and may put, in a part of the water, butter or drops of curds and apply the water to moisten three times the boy&rsquo;s head with the mantra &lsquo;may Aditi cut thy hair; may the waters moisten ( thy hair) for vigour &lsquo;. Then60d on the right portion of the boy&rsquo;s hair the father puts three kuśa bunches with the points towards the boy with the formula &lsquo;herb, protect him&rsquo; (Tai. 9. I. %. 1. 1). With the words ' Axe, do not harm him&rsquo; (Tai. S. 1. 2. 1. 1 ) he presses a copper razor (on the kuśa blades). The hair is cut&rsquo; with the mantra &lsquo;with that razor with which Savits, the wise, cut ( the hair ) of king Soma and of Varuna, cut now his (the boy&rsquo;s hair), Oh brābmaṇas, so that he may be endowed with long life and (reach) old age&rsquo;. Each time the hair is cut, he gives the cut hair with their ends turned towards the east together with sami leaves to the mother, who puts them down on the bull dung, Cutting is done a second time with the mantra' with what Dhata shaved ( the head) of Bphaspati, Agni and Indra for the</p>

The cutting is done a third time with the mantra &lsquo;with what he may after night ( is past ) see the sun again and again, with that I shave thy (head) for the sake of long life, fame and happiness&rsquo;. The cutting is done for the fourth time with all the three mantras together, Then the hair is out three times on the left side similarly. The edge of the razor is then wiped off with the mantra &lsquo;when thou sbavest as a shaver the hair ( of the boy ) with the razor that wounds and is well-shaped purify his head, but do not deprive him of life&rsquo;. Then he gives orders to the barber &lsquo;doing with lukewarm water what bas to be done with water, arrange his bair ( well ) without causing him (the boy ) any wound&rsquo;. Let him have the hair of the boy arranged according to the custom of the family. The rite only (without the mantras ) is per formed for a girl.eus</p>
<p>According to several gūtras, the cut hair placed in the dung of a bull is buried in a cow stable603 or is thrown in a pond or in the vicinity of water ( Pār., Bhār. ) or is buried at the root of the Udumbara tree ( Bhār.) or in a bunch of darbha grass (Baud.. Bhār., Gobhila ) or in the forest (Gobhila). The Mānava gr. prescribes that as the hair fall down when cut they are gathered by some friendly person. The Kathaka gf. and Mānava gf. say that the barber gets a sesame cake and a fine piece of cloth, while Vaik, says food is given to him. A bath for the boy is expressly prescribed by Baud. and some others.</p>
<p>There is a great divergence of views about the number of locks of hair to be left on the head and the portion of the head where they are to be left. Baud. gr. says that one or three or five looks 604 may be left on the head or according to family usage and he further says that some sages say that the looks should</p>

<p>be as many as the pravaras invoked by the father.605 Aśv. gr., and Pār. gr. say that looks may be kept according to family usage. Ap. gì, says that the locks may in number follow the pravara or they may be kept according to family usage. Gobhila and Khādira say that the locks should be arranged according to gotra and family usage. Whether they mean by &lsquo;gotra&rsquo; the number of pravaras of the gotra or some rule such as the Kathaka gives is not clear. The Kathaka gr. says that the Vāgiṣthas keep a lock on the right, that persons of Atri and Kaśyapa gotra (or pravara ) keep looks both on the right and the left, that the Bhrgus shaves the entire head, that the Angiras gotra keeps five looks or only a line of hair, while persons of other gotras (like Agastya, Viśvāmitra &amp;c.) keep a sikbā (without any particular number of locks ) simply because it is an suspicious sign or one may follow the usage of one&rsquo;s80 family. Vaik.607 says that the locks may be one, two, three, five or seven according to the pravaras. Rgveda 608 VII. 33. 1 refers to the fact that Vasisthas had a look of hair on the right side of the head and so the rule of the Kathaka has a very hoary antiquity behind it. Up to modern times one of the characteri stic outward signs of all Hindus was the sikhā ( the top-knot). A verse of Devala says that whatever religious aot a man does without the yajñopavita or without sikhā is as good as undone and Hārita rules that a person who cuts off his sikhā through hate or ignorance or foolishness becomes pure only after</p>

Sabara (on Jaimini I. 3, %) remarks that the sikhā (its position and locks) is a sign to indicate the gotra and quotes Rg. VI. 75, 17 ( yatra bāṇāḥ &amp;o. cited above in note 598). Vasiṣtha (II. 21 ) pres oribes tbat membors of all varnas (including the sūdra ) should arrange their hair acoording to the fixed usage (of their family) or should shave the whole head except the sikhā, A Vedic passage840 is the head that has no sikhā on it is unholy'. For rules about the sikha of students vide later on under upanayana. During recent times men, particularly those receiving English education in towns and cities, are forsaking the ancient practice of keeping a sikbā and follow the western method of allowing the hair to grow on the whole head.</p>
<p>In modern times the rite of cūdākarana generally takes place if at all on the day of Upanayana,</p>
<p>Aśv. gr. (I, 17, 18) expressly says that the ceremony of cūdākarana was to be perforined for girls also, but no Vedic mantras were to be repoated. Manu ( II. 66 ) Bays that all the ceremonies froin jātakarına to caula must be performed at the proper times for girls also in order to purify their bodies but without mantras and Yāj. (1. 13 ) is to the same effect. Even such late writers as Mitramiśra say that the caula of girls may be performed according to the usage of the family and that their bair may be entirely shaved or a siklā may be kept or there should be no shaving at all.911</p>
<p>In some castes even in modern times girls when mere children are shaved once, it being supposed that the first hair are impure.</p>

<p>between the third year when asually caula was performed and the 8th year (from conception) when the upanayana usually took place ( in the case of brābmanas). They state that rarely upanayana was performed even in the 5th year ( as will be shown hereafter ). Some faint light is thrown on this matter by the Arthasāstra of Kautilya, 81% which says that the prince after the performance of caula is to engage in the study of the alphabet and of arithmetio, and after his upanayana he is to study the Vedas, ūnvikṣiki (metaphysics ), vārlā ( agriculture and the science of wealth ) and dandaniti (the art of government) up till the 16th year when the godāna ceremony is to be performed and after which year ho may marry. Kalidāsa also (in Raghuvamsa III. 28) says that prince Aja first mastered the alphabet and then entered into the ocean of (Sanskrit ) liter ature. Bana has its probably the Arthasāstra in view when he makes prince Candrāpida enter the temple of learning ( vidyā mandira ) at 6 and remain there till he became sixteen and he (like Milton in his letter to Hartlile ) tells us how extensive the ideal curriculum of studies in arts and soiences for the prince was thought to be. In the Uttararamacarita ( Act II) it is said that Kusa and Lata were taught vidyās other than the Veda after their caula and before upanayana.</p>
<p>It appears that at least from the early centuries of the Christian era, &amp; ceremony called Vidyārambha (commencement of learning the alphabet ) was celebrated. Apararka (pp. 30-31) and the Sm.C.(I. p.26)cite verses from the Markandeya-puranasit</p>

<p>Sanskāras-Vidyārambha</p>
<p>267</p>
<p>about vidyārambha as follows: in the fifth year of the child on some day from the 12th of the bright half of Kartika to the 11th of the bright half of Aṣadha, but excluding the 18t, 6th, 8th, 15th tithi or rikta tithis (i. e. 4th, 9th and 14th ) and Saturday and Tuesday, the ceremony of beginning to learn should be performed. Having worshipped Hari ( Viṣnu ), Lakṣmi, Sarasvati, the sutra writers of one&rsquo;s sākha and the lore peculiar to one&rsquo;s family, one should offer in the fire oblations of olarified butter to the above mentioned deities and should hone our brāhmaṇas by the payment of dakṣiṇā. The teacher should sit facing the east and the boy should face the west and the teacher should begin to teach the first lesson to the boy who should receive the benedictions of brāhmanas. Thereafter teaching should be stopped on the days of anadhyāya (which will be specified later on).</p>
<p>The Samskāra-prakāśa (pp. 321-325 ) and Samskāraratna inālā (pp. 904-907 ) have an extensivo note, a considerable part of which is devoted to astrological matters. The Samskāraprakāśa quotes passages from Viśvāmitra, Devala and other sages and works that vidyārambha is performed in the 5th year or in any case before upanayane. It also quotes a verse from Nṭsimba that Sarasvati and Ganapati should be worshipped and then the teacher should be honoured. The modern practice is to begin learning the alphabet on an auspicious day, generally the 10th of the bright half of Āśvina, Sarasvati and Ganapati are wor shipped, the teacher is honoured and the boy is asked to repeat the words &lsquo;om namah siddham&rsquo; and to write them on a slate and then he is taught the letters (&lsquo;a&rsquo;, &lsquo;a&rsquo; &amp;c.) of the alphabet. The Samskāraratnamālā$15 calls this ceremony Aksarasvikāra (appro priately enough) and among other texts cites a long prose passage from Garga quoted in the Pārijāta and prescribes a homa also with ajyāhutis to Sarasvati, Hari, Lakṣmi, Vighnesa (Ganapati), sūtrakāras and one&rsquo;s vidya,</p>

<p>UPANAYANA</p>
<p>This word literally means &lsquo;leading or taking near&rsquo;. But the important question is &lsquo;near what&rsquo;? It appears that it originally meant &lsquo;taking near the ācārya&rsquo; (for instruction); it may have also meant &lsquo;introducing the novice to the stage of student-hood&rsquo;. Some of the grhyasūtras bring out this songe clearly e. g. the Hir. gr. I. 5. 2618 says &ldquo;The teacher thon makes the boy utter &lsquo;I have come unto brahmacarya. Lead me near (initiate me into it). Let me be a student,- impelled by the god Savitr&rsquo;&rdquo;. The Mānava and Kathaka gr. ( 41.1) also use the word upāyana for upanayana and Adityadarśana on Kāthaka gr. ( 41. 1 ) says that upānaya, upangyana, mauñjibandhana, batukarana, vratabandha are synonyms.</p>
<p>A few words about the origin and development of this most important samskāra would not be out of place here. Compe rison with the ancient Zoroastrian scriptures ( vide S. B. E. vol. V. pp. 285-290 about the sacred girdle and shirt) and the modern practices among the Parsis of India tend to show that Upanayana goes back to an Indo-Iranian origin. But that subject is outside the scope of this work. Confining ourselves to Indian Literature, we find that already in the Rg. X. 109.5 the word &lsquo;brahmacari&rsquo; occurs &lsquo;oh gods he ( Bṛbaspati), all pervading one, moves as a brabmacārl pervading all (sacrifices); he is only one part of the gods ( i. e. of sacrifices ); Bphaspati secured by that (i. e. by his service to the gods ) &amp; wife (me who am named) Juhū, who was (formerly ) taken by Soma&rsquo;, 617 The</p>

<p>Upanayana</p>
<p>word &lsquo;upanayana&rsquo; 818 can be derived and explained in two ways: (1) taking (the boy) near the acārya, (2) that rite by which the boy is taken to the acārya. The first sense appears to have been the original one and when an extensive ritual came to be associated with upanayana the second came to be the sense of the word. Such an ancient work as the Ap. Dh. S. I.1.1. 19 says that upanayana is &amp; Barnskāra (purificatory rite ) laid down by revelation for him who seeks learning (i. e. it accepts the second explanation) or this sūtra may mean it is a samskāra brought about by imparting the śruti ( viz. Gāyatri mantra ) to him who seeks learning&rsquo;. This would mean that upanayana principally is gāyatryupadeśa ( tho imparting of the sacred Gāyatri mantra), This appears to be suggestod by the Vedic passage quoted above ( 154 f. n. 356) &lsquo;he created the brāhmaṇa with Gāyatri, the ksatriya with Tristubh, the vaisya with Jagati&rsquo;, and by Kātyāyana Srauta &lsquo;one should initiate the brābmana with Gayatri&rsquo;. Jaiminists also (in VI. 1.35) propounds the view that upanayana is a samskāra and has a seen result viz, thereby the boy is brought near the teacher for learning Veda,</p>
<p>Rg. III. 8. 4 620 is a verse that clearly indicates that some of the characteristics of upanayana described in the grhya sūtras were well known even then. There the sacrificial post (yūpa ) is praised as a young person ( i. e. in the language of the later classical rhetoricians there is the first kind of the figure Atisayokti)&rdquo; here comes the youth, well dressed and encircled (the boy by his mekhala and the post by its rasana); he, when born, attains eminence ; wise sages, full of devotion to the gods in their hearts and entertaining happy thoughts, raise him up&rsquo;. Here in &lsquo;un-nayanti&rsquo; we have the same root that we have in upanayana. This mantra is employed in the upanayana by several grhya sutrase. g. Asv. I. 20. 8 (who employs it for</p>

<p>making the boy circumambulate) and Pār. II. 2. (presoribes that the mantra is to be recited when tying the girdle round the boy&rsquo;s waist). In the Tai. 8. VI.4) 3. 10.5 we have the famous passage referring to the three debts where the words &lsquo;brahmacārl&rsquo; and &lsquo;brahmacarya&rsquo; occur. &lsquo;Every brāhmaṇa when born is indebted in three debts viz. in brahmacarya to the sages, in sacrifice to the gods and in offspring to the manes; he indeed becomes free from debts who has a son, who sacrifices and who dwells ( with the teacher) as a brahmacārl.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In the other Vedas and in the Brāhmaṇa literature there is ample material to show what the characteristic features of upanayana and brahmacarya were. The whole of Atharvaveda XI. 7 ( 26 verses ) is a hymn containing hyperbolical laudation of the brahmacāri (Vedio student) and brahmacarya. The very first verse 688 may be cited as a sample The brahmacāri incessantly covering ( the world by his glory ) roams in the two worlds; the gods have the same thoughts ( of grace and favour) about him; he fills his teacher by bis austerities&rsquo;. Verse 3 says &lsquo;the teacher leading ( the boy ) near him makes the brahmacāri like unto a foetus&rsquo; (here the word &lsquo;upanayamānaḥ&rsquo; occurs ). Verse 4 states that the heaven and the earth are the samidh&rsquo; (the fuel stick) of the brahmacārl and that the brahmacārl by his mekhalā (girdle), by his samidh and by his life of hard work fills the world with austerities. Verse 6 tells us that the brahmacārl wears the skin of a black antelope and has a long beard; verse 13 says that the brahmaoāri offers samidh into fire (or if fire is not available) to the sun, to the moon, to the wind or into waters. This hymn thus brings out most of the characteristio features of the brahmacārl-and of upanayana ( viz, deerskin, mekbalā, offering of samidh, begging and a life of hard work and restraint), From the reference to the beard and from the words &lsquo;this man (ayam purusah)&rsquo; occurring in the Atharvaveda VIII. 1. 1 and elsewhere it appears probable that upanayana was performed rather later in those ancient days than in the days of the gutras.</p>

<p>Upanayana</p>
<p>___ In the Tai. Br. III.683 10. 11 there is the story of Bharadvaja who remained a brabmacāri for three parts of his life ( i. e. till 75 ) and to whom Indra said that in all that long period of brahmacarya he had mastered only an insignificant portion ( three handfuls out of three mountains) of the Vedas, which were endless in extent. The story of Nābhānedistha, son of Manu, who was excluded from ancestral property at a partition made by his brothers, narrated in the Ait. Br. shows $24 that he was a brahmacāri staying with a teacher away from his father&rsquo;s place. The Sat. Br. XI. 5. 4, contains many and almost complete details about the life of brahmacūrins which bear &amp; very close similarity to those taught in the grhya sūtras. A brief summary is set out below. The boy says &lsquo;I have come unto brahmacarya&rsquo; and &lsquo;let me be a brahmacāri&rsquo;. Then the teacher asks him ' what is your name&rsquo;; then the teacher takes him near (upanayati); the teacher takes hold of the boy&rsquo;s hand with the words ' you are the brahmacārt of Indra; Agni is your teacher, I am your teacher, N. N. (addressing the boy by his name)'. Then he consigns the boy to (the care of ) the ele ments. The teacher instructs him ' drink water, do work (in the teacher&rsquo;s house ), put a fuel stick (on the fire), do not sleep (by day). He repeats the Savitri (mantra sacred to Savitr). Formerly it was repeated a year ( after the boy came as a brahmacari), then at the end of six months, 24 days,12 days, 3 days; but one should repeat to the brāhman, boy the verse at once ( on the very day of upanayana ); the teacher repeats it to him first each pada separately, then the half and then the whole. Being a brabmacāri one should not eat honey.625</p>

It also says that after one finisbes studenthood and takes the ceremonial bath one should not beg. Vide Gopatha Br. (ed. by Gastra ) 2, 3 and Baud. Dh. S. I. 2. 53. The Sat. Br.

<p>Janamejaya Pārikṣita asks the hamsas ( who were the Abavaniya and Dakṣiṇā fires ) what is holy' and the latter reply &lsquo;It is brahmacarya&rsquo;(vide Gopatha Br. 2.5). Gopatha (2.5) further says the period of studenthood for the mastery of all Vedas is 48 years, wbich, being distributed among the Vedas in four parts, makes brahmacarya last for 12 years, which is the lowest limit; one should practise brahmacarya according to one&rsquo;s ability before taking the ceremonia1628 bath,' The same work says that the brahmacāri should fetch gamidhs every day for worship ping fire and beg and that if he does not do so continuously for seven days he has to undergo upanayanı again (2. 6) and that the lady of the house should daily give alms to a brahmacarin with the idea that he may not deprive her of her wealth, of merit due to iṣtāpurta. It also says that a brahmacāri should not sleep on a cot, should not engage in singing and dancing, should not roain about, should not spit about nor go to a cemetery.629</p>

<p>Upanayana</p>
<p>275</p>
<p>It appears from the above and from the Upanigad pagsages set out immediately below that originally Upanayana was a very simple matter. The would-be student came to the teacher with a samidh in his hand and told the teacher that he desired to enter the stage of studenthood and begged to be allowed to be a brahmaoirl living with the teacher. There were no elaborate ceremonies like those desoribed in the grhya sutras. The word brahmacarya occurs in the Katha. Up. I.1.15, Mundaka II. 1.7, Chandogya VI. 1. I and other Upan iṣads. The Chandogya and the Br. Up., probably the oldest among the Upaniṣads, furnish very valuable information. That some ceremonies were required before a young boy was admitted as a student even in Upaniṣadio times is clear from the statement in the Chāndogya V. 11. 7830 that when Aś vapati Kekaya was approached by Prācinagala Aupamanyava and four others who carried fuel in their hands (like young students) and who were grown-up householders and theologians, &lsquo;ho ( Asyapati) without submit ting them to the rites of Upanayana began the discourse&rsquo;. When Satyakāma 631 Jābāla tells the truth about his gotra to Gautama Hāridrumata, the latter says &lsquo;fetch, dear boy, fuel, I shall initiate you. You have not swerved from the truth(Chāndo gya IV.4.5). Similarly in the Bș. Up. VI. 2. 7. it is said that foriner students ( i. e, students in former ages ) approached (the teacher for brahmacarya) only in words (i. e. without any further solemn rite or ceremony ).638 In the most ancient times it is probable that the father himself always taught his son. 6831 But it appears that from the times of the Tai S, and the Brābmaṇas the student generally went to a guru and stayed in his house (vide note 624 about Nābhānediṣtha ). Uddalaka Aruni who was himself a profound philosopher of brahma asks his son Śretaketu to enter upon brahmacarya and sends him to a teacher to learn the Vedas. 686 The same Upaniṣad describes the</p>

<p>asrama of brahmacarya ' dwelling as a brahmapārl in the house of a teacher, mortifying his body in the house of his teacher till his 888 end&rsquo;. Chāndogya IV. 4. 4. shows that the teacher asked the pupil his gotra ( in order that he may address him by that name ). The same Upaniṣad shows that the brahmatāri had to beg for food (IV. 3. 5), that he had to look after the fire of his teacher (IV. 10.1-2) and that he had to tend his cattle (IV. 4. 5). The age when upanayana was performed is not expresaly stated in the Upaniṣads except in the case of Svetaketu who was 1% ( vide note 634 above). The period of student-hood was usually twelve (Chandogya II. 23.1, IV, 10.1, V1.1.), though the Chāndo gya ( VIII. 11. 3 ) speaks of Indra&rsquo;s brahmacarya for 101 years and Chandogya II. 23. 1. speaks of brahmacarya for life.</p>
<p>We shall now turn to upenayana as described in the sūtras and smstis. The following matters fall to be treated under Upanayana: The proper age for upanayana, the auspicious Beasons for it; the skin, the garments, the girdle and the staff for the brahmacārins of different varpās; the yajñopavita ; the preliminaries of upanayana, such as homa, taking of curds by the boy, afjalipūraṇa, aśmārohana; the principal rites of upanayana viz. taking of the student&rsquo;s hand by the teachers touching the chest of the student expressive of acceptance as pupil, banding the boy to Savits and other gods (paridana), instruction in the duties of the student (such as putting fuel on fire, begging &amp;o.), instruction in the famous Savitri mantra ; iedhājanana; study of the Vedas and daily recitation of Vedio texts; special vratas of the brahmacāri; Patitasūvitrika (those whose upanayana has not been performed at all) and rules about them. These matters will now be dealt with in order. It should be remembered that all these matters are not dwelt upon by all the smrtis nor are they treated of in the same order. Further the Vedio mantras often differ in the different sūtras.</p>
<p>The proper age for Upanayana The Aśv. gr. 638 (I. 19. 1-6) says that a brāhmaṇa boy should undergo upanayana in the eighth year from birth or from conception, a kṣatriya in the 11th year, a vaisya in the</p>

(1.1), Gobhila (II. 10. 1) gphy&amp; sūtras, Yāj. I. 14, Ap. Dh. S. I. 1. 1. 19 expressly say that the respective years are calculated from conception. The Mahābbāṣya 688 also refers to the rule that a brāhmaṇa&rsquo;s upanayana is to be performed in the 8th year from conception. Par. 38 gr. (II. 2) allows upanayana in the 8th year from birth or conception and adds that in the case of all varnas family usage may be followed. Yāj. I. 14 also refers to family usage. Sān. gr. (II. 1.1) allows upanayaoa in the 8th or 10th year from conception, the Mānava gṛ. (I. 22. 1) allows it in the 7th or 9th year, the Kathaka gf. (41. 1-3) prescribes 7th, 9th and 11th years for the upanayana of the three varnas respectively. In some smṛtis upanayana is allowed to be performed even earlier or at different ages, e. g. Gautama (I. 6-8) prescribes that upanayana for a brāhmana is in the 8th year from conception but it may be in the 5th or 9th according to the result desired; and Manu. II. 37 says that if spiritual eminence ( for the boy ) is desired ( by his father) then upanayana may be performed in the 5th year for a brāhmans, in the 6th year for a ksatriya if there is a desire for military power, in the 8th for a vaisya if there is desire for endeavour to accumulate wealth.

<p>spiritual eminence, long life and wealth. The Ap. Dh. 8. I. 1. 1.21 and Baud. gr. (II. 5) prescribe 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, 11th, 12th years respectively for one desiring spiritual eminence, long life, brilliance, abundant food, physical vigour and cattle.</p>
<p>Therefore, the 8th, 11th and 12th years from birth for the three varnas are the principal time for upanayana; while the years from 5th onwards up to 11th are the secondary time ( gauṇa ) for a brāhmaṇa, 9th to 16th are secondary for ksatriya and so on. From 12th to 16 is gaunatara for brāhmaṇas and after 16 gaunatama for them. Vide Samskāra-prakāśa p. 342.</p>
<p>The auspicious times according to the Ap. gr. and Ap. Dh. S. I. 1. 1. 19, Hir. gr. (1.1) and Vaik. are vasanta ( spring), griṣma (summer), and sarad (autumn) for the three Varpas. The Bhār. gr. (1. 1 ) says that upanayana for a brābmapa should be performed in vasanta, for a kṣatriya in summer or hemanta, for a vaisya in sarad, in the rains for a carpenter (rathakāra ) or in sisira for all. Sabara in his bhāsya on Jaimini VI. 1. 33 where upanayana is denied to śūdras quotes</p>
<p>Tasante brāhmaṇam upanayita' as &amp; Vedic text. Áśv. gr. I. 4.1 ( quoted above in f. n. 494), Hir. gr. (I. 1. 5, S. B. E. vol. 30 p.1 37 ) and Bhār, gr. (1.1) say that upanayana should be performed in the bright half of a month, on an auspicious nakṣatra, particularly under a naksatra the name of which is masculine.640</p>
<p>Later works introduced very intricate rules about the proper months, tithis, days and times for upanayana. It is neither possible nor very necessary to go into these astrological details. But a few words must be said as in modern times upanayana is performed only in accordance with these rules. Vṛddhagārgya841 laid down that six months from Māgba wore the proper months for upamayana, while others say that five months from Māgha are the proper ones. Then 1st, 4th, 7th, 8th, 9th, 13th, 14th, 15th i. e. ( full moon and new moon ) tithis are generally avoided (though there are some counter exoeptions wbich are not set out here). It is stated that upanayana should not be performed whon Venus is so near the sun that it cannot be seen, when the sun is in the first degree of any zodiacal sign, on anadhyaya</p>

<p>days and on galagraha (( the tithis specified above). Jupiter, Venus, Marg48 and Mercury are respectively the presiding deities of the Rgveda and the other Vedas. Therefore the upanayana of those who have to study these Vedas should be performed on the week days presided over by these planets. Among week days Wednesday, Thursday and Friday are the best, Sunday is mid dling, Monday is the least suitable, but Tuesday and Saturday are prohibited (except that for students of the Samaveda and kṣatriyas Tuesday is allowed). Among the nakṣatras644 the proper ones are Hasta, Citrā, Svāti, Puṣya, Dhaniṣtha, Asvini, Mrgaśiras, Punarvasu, Sravana and Revati. There are other rules about nakṣatras with respect to those who follow a particular Veda ( which are passed over ). One rule is that all nakṣatras except Bharaṇi, Kșttikā, Maghā, Visakha, Jyestha, Satatārakā are good for all. The Moon and Jupiter must be astrologically strong with reference to the boy&rsquo;s horoscope. The rule about Jupiter probably arose from the fact that Jupiter was supposed to rule over knowledge and happiness and as upanayana was meant to be the entrance for Veda-study, Jupiter&rsquo;s benevolent aspect was thought to be necessary. If Jupiter and Venus are not to be seen owing to nearness to the sun, upanayana cannot be per formed. Jupiter when in the 2nd, 5th, 7th, 9th, 11th zodiacal sign from the sign of birth ( calculation to be made inclusive of the sign of birth ) is auspicious, when in the 1st, 3rd, 6th, 10th place from the sign of birth it is auspicious after the performance of a propitiatory homa and when it is in the 4th, 8th, 12th place from birth, it is inauspicious. The moon is supposed to be malefic when she is in the 2nd, 4th, 5th, 8th, 9th or 12th place froin the sign of birth. Four hours from sunrise is the best for upanayana, from that time to noon is middling and afternoon is prohibited. Some said that a person&rsquo;s upanayana should not be performed in the month in which he was born, others restricted the prohibition to the pakṣa ( the half) of the month in which he was born. There are other rules about the Lagna (the rising</p>

<p>A brahmacārl had to wear two garments, one for the lower part of the body (vāsas), another for covering the upper part of the body (uttariya). Ap. Dh. S. (I. 1. 2. 39-1. 1. 3. 1-2) says that the garment845 (vāsas) for a brāhmana, ksatriya or vaisya brahmavari is respectively to be made of bemp, flax, ajina ( deerskin), some teachers prescribe that the lower garment should be of cotton but coloured reddish-yellow for brāhmaṇas; dyed with madder for ksatriyas, dyed with turmeric for vaisyas.' Pār. gr. (II.5), Manu (II. 41 ) speak of &lsquo;āvika&rsquo;( made of wool.) for vaiśys instead of *ajina'. Vas. Dh. 8. (XI. 64-67) says that a brāhmana (brahmacāri) should wear a (lower) garment which is white and unblemished (or new) and for a ksatriya or vaisya it should be the same as in Ap. Dh., but for vaisya Vas. prescribes also one made of kusa grass or he says that all should wear cotton cloth that is undyed.' Gaut. (I, 17-20) on the other hand says for all the lower gar ment may be made of hemp, flax or kuśa grass (cira) or of the hair of the mountainous goat ( kutapa ); other teachers prescribe coloured garments, one coloured with the juice of trees for brāhmaṇas and madder-red and yellow for ksatriya and vaibya. Aśv. gr. (I. 19. 8), Pār. gr. (II. 5), Vas. Dh, S. (XI. 61-63), Baud. gr. (II.5.16 ) say that the upper garment for a brāhmaṇa should be the skin of a black deer, for kṣatriya the skin of ruru deer and for a vaisya of cow-skin or of goat skin. Baud. and Asv. pres. cribe only goat skin. Pār. gļ, adds that if any one cannot secure &amp; skin suited to one&rsquo;s varna, he may wear an upper garment of cow-hide as the cow is the chief among animals.648 Baud. gr.

<p>ciroumstances. Ap. Dh. 8. (1. 1. 3.7-8) gives the option to all varnas to use a sheep skin (as upper garment) or a woollen plaid ( kambala ). Ābv. gr. ( I. 19. 8-9) appears to suggest that the lower and upper garments may be of the same skin or that the lower garment may be white or coloured ( as stated above by Ap. Dh, S.). The Kathaka gr.647 ( 41. 13 ) says that the upper garment for the three varpas should be respectively of the skins of black deer, tiger and ruru deer. A vestige of these rules survives in the modern practice of tying a small piece of deer skin to the yajaopavita of the boy when his upanayana is performed.</p>
<p>That the rules about the lower and upper garments go back to great antiquity is shown by a reference to a Brahmana passage in the Ap.

( I. 19. 13 and I. 20.1) says a staff of the palasa wood for a brāhmana, of udumbara for a kṣatriya and of bilva for a vaisya or all the varnas may employ a staff of any of these trees.&rsquo; The Āp. gr. 11. 15-16 (this is the same as Ap. Dh. 8.1.1.2. 38) says that the staff should be of palāsa wood for a brāhmaṇa, of the branch of the nyagrodha tree ( so that the downward end of the branch forma the tip of the staff) for a ksatriya, of badara or udumbara wood for a vaibya; while some teachers say that the staff should be made of a tree (which is used in sacrifices ) without reference to any varna, Gaut. (I. 21 ) and Baud. Dh. 8. (II. 5. 17 ) Bay that the staff of palāśa or bilva should be used for brābmana and Gaut. (I. 22-23 ) says that aśvattha and pilu wood staff should be used respectively for kṣatriya and vaisya or of any sacrificial tree for all varnag. Baud. gr. prescribes nyagrodha or rauhitaka for kṣatriya, and badara or udumbara for vaisya. Pār. gṛ.</p>

<p>(IL 5 ) recommends a staff of palaga, bilva and udumbara respectively for the three varnas (or any of these for all ). Kathaka gr. (41.22)recommends palāsa, aśvattha and nyagrodha respectively for the three. Manu (II. 45) presoribes bilva and palaga for brahmana, vata and khadira for kṣatriya, pilu and udumbara for vaibya, and Kulluka adds that two staffs should be used by the boy, as two are recommended in a compound.</p>
<p>• The staff was required for support, for controlling the cattle of the teacher ( which the student was to tend ), for proteo tion when going out at night and for guidance when entering a river or the like.649</p>
<p>The length of the staff varied according to the varna of the boy. Aśv. gr. I. 19. 13, Gaut. I. 25, Vas. Dh. 8. (XI. 55-57), Par. gr. (II. 5), Manu ( II. 46 ) presoribe that in the case of the brahmana, ksatriya or vaibga boy respectively the staff should be as high as his head, forehead or the tip of the nose, The Sān. gr. ( 11.&lsquo;1. 21-23, S. B. E. vol. 29. p. 260) on the other hand reverses this ( the brahmans having the shortest staff and the vaisya the longest ). Gaut. I. 26 says that the staff should be one not eaten by worms, should have the bark attached to it, and should have a curved tip, while Manu II. 47 adds that the staff should be straight, pleasing to look at and should not have come into contact with fire. The Sān. gr. (II. 13. 2-3) prescribes that the brahmacāri should not allow any one to pass between himself and his staff and that if the staff, girdle or the yajñopavita break or rend, he has to undergo a penance (same as the one for the breaking of a chariot at a wedding procession ) and that at the end of the period of brahmacarya, he should sacrifice in water the yajñopavita, staff, the girdle and the skin 650 with a mantra to Varuna ( Rg. I. 24. 6) or with the sacred syllable &lsquo;om&rsquo;. Manu II. 64 and Viṣnu Dh. 8. ( 27. 29 ) say the same thing.</p>

<p>tled round a brahmana boy&rsquo;s waist, one made of mūry: grass (which is used for making a bowstring) for a kṣatriya and one of hemp cords for a vaisya. Pāraskara says that the string of a bow should be used for a ksatriya and of mūrvā grass for a vaisya and adds that in the absence of these the girdle should respectively be made of kusa, aśmantaka and balvaja grass ( for brābmana, kṣatriya and vaibya). Manu (II. 42-43) gives the same rules as Pār, gr, Ap. Dh. 8. (I. 1.2. 35-37) si optionally allows &amp; girdle of muñja grass with an iron piece intertwined in it for ksatriyas and woollen string or the yoke-string or a string of tāmala bark for vaisyas ( according to some ). Baud. gr. (II. 5. 13 ) allows mauñji girdle also to all. Some of the sūtras (e. g. Baud. gr., Āp. Dh.S.) further prescribe that the girdle of muñja grass should have three strings to it and the grass should have its ends turned to the right and the knot of the girdle should be brought near the navel. Manu ( II. 43 ) says that there may be one knot or three or five (according to family usage, says Kullūks ). 688</p>
<p>In order to convey an idea of the rites of upanayana in the days of the grhya sūtras the ceremony as contained in the Asy. gr. sūtra (which is among the shortest ) is set out in full.*** &lsquo;Let him initiate the boy who is decked, whose hair (on the head) is shaved (and arranged), who wears a new garment or an antelope skin if a brāhmaṇa, ruru skin if a ksatriya, goat&rsquo;s skin if a vaisya; if they put on garments they should put on dyed ones, reddish-yellow, red and yellow (for a brāhmana, ksatriya, vaiśya respectively), they should have gird]es and staffs ( ag described above). While the boy takes hold of ( the hand of) his teacher, the latter offers ( a homa of olarified butter oblations) in the fire (as described above) and seats himself to the north of the fire with his face turned to the east, while the other one ( the boy ) stations himself in front ( of the teacher) with his face turned to the west. The teacher then fills the folded hands of both bimself and of the boy with water and with the vergewe choose that of Savitr (Rg.

<p>of interest and divergence may be noted here briefly. It is remarkable that Aśv., Āp. and several other sūtrakāras do not say a word about the sacred thread, while &amp; few like Hir. gr. (I. 2. 6), Bhār. gs. ( 1.3 ) and Mānava gr. ( I. 22. % ) say that the boy already wears the yajśopavita before the homa begins; while Baud. gr.662 (II. 5. 7) says that the boy is given the yajñopavśta and then made to recite the well-known mantra &ldquo;the Yajñopapita is extremely sacred&rsquo; and the Vaik, smārta (II. 5 ) says that the teacher gives the upper garment to the boy with 668 the verge paridam vāgah&rsquo;, the sacred thread with the mantra &lsquo;Yajñopavitam&rsquo;and the black antelope skin with the mantra &lsquo;the eye of Mitra&rsquo;. Sudarśana on Āp. gr. 10.5 says that the boy puts on the yajāopavita with the mantra before he takes bis meal ( according to some) or (according to others) before he puts the fuel stick on the fire and relies on Āp, Dk. 8. I. 5. 15. 1 for support. According to Karka and Haribara ( on Pāraskara ) the yajśopavita was given to the student by the teacher after the tying of the girdle. The Samskāratattva p. 934 says the same. Late works like the Samskāraratnamālā (p. 202 ) prescribe the wearing of the sacred thread before the bome. The origin and development of the ideas about yajñopayita will be dealt with separately later on, Ap. gf, (X.5), Baud gs. (II. 5. 7) and Pār. gr. (II. 2) prescribe a dinner to brāhmaṇas before the ceremonies begin and receiving their benedictions. Ap. gr. (X.5), Bhār. gr. (I. 1), Baud gp. 685 (II. 5. 7) say that the boy also is made to take food; socording to later works ( e. g. Samskararatnamālā ) the boy takes his meal in the same dish with his mother (for the last time) and other brahmacārins (eight in number) are also invited at the same time for meals in the</p>

<p>company of the boy. This practice is observed even in modern times. Almost all prescribe that the boy is shaved on this day ( as in caula ); this also is done in modern times. But in ancient #68 times the shaving was done by the ācārya bimself as stated by Sudarsana on Āp. gr. 10. 6-8. There are several other matters detailed in Ap. and others, on which Asy, and some others are silent. The important ones are mentioned below.</p>
<p>(a) Ap. gr. (10.9), Mānava gr. (I. 23. 12), Baud. gr. (II. 5, 10), Khādira gr. (11. 4) and Bhār, gr. (1.8) make the boy tread on &amp; stone to the north of the fire with his right foot after home. The mantras repeated in the several sūtras are significant asking the boy to be firm like a stone. 669</p>
<p>(6) Mānava gf. (1.22.3) and Kathaka gp. (41. 10) preboribe after homa the tasting of ourds thrice after repeating the verse * Dadbikrāvạo skāriṣam&rsquo;(Rg. IV. 39. 6=Tai. 8. 1. 5. 4. 11 ).</p>
<p>(c) Pār. gp. (II.2), Bhār. gr. (1.7), Ap. gs. (11.1-4), Āp. Mantrapātha (IL. 3. 27-30), Baud. gr. II. 5. 25 ( quoting Satya yanaka), Mānava gṛ. I. 22. 4-5, and Khādira gr. II. 4. 12 refer to the fact that the teacher asks the boy his name and the latter pronounces his name. The teacher also asks whose brahmacārı the boy is.</p>
<p>A person was given ( as shown above at pp. 246-247 ) an abhivadanlya name either derived from the naksatra of birth or from a deity name or the gotra name. This was necessary for several purposes. The teacher had to know that the boy came from a good family, he had also to address him by name ( as there might be several pupils).

<p>teacher asked him his gotra ) that only brāhmaṇas were admitted to brahmaoarya, All smrtis, even the latest, contemplated that the three castes had the right to learn the Veds. It is one thing to have a right and another to exeroise it. Probably very few ksatriyas cared to submit their sons to the rigorous discipline of brahmacarya as laid down in the smrtis and cared much less for Veda studies. In the Mahābhārata and in the Kādambari it is said that the princes were taught in a special house con struoted for the purpose and teachers were paid handsomely and brought there to teach instead of the princes going to the teachers.</p>
<p>It is not possible for want of space to show how the great est possible confusion prevails as to the order of the various components of the ceremony of upanayana, But a few striking examples may be gived. Aśvalāyana gr. treats of the tying of the girdle and the giving of the staff almost at the end of the ceremony, while Ap. gr. puts this after homa and immediately before anjalipūrana (Glling the folded hands of both with water); Asvolāyana puts adityadarsana after the boy&rsquo;s band is held by the teacher and before paridāna (handing the boy over to the deities ), but Bhār. ( I. 9) puts it after the instruction in the observances of brahmacarya. The Bhār. gr. (1.9) treats of adityadarśana almost at the end of the rites, while Asy. places it among the earlier ones after homa. Besides the same mantras are employed by different sūtras for different purposes; for example, the mantra *susrayaḥ &amp;c.&rsquo; is employed by Ap. at the time of taking the staff by the boy (XI. 14 and Mantrapatha II. 5. 1), while Abv. gr. ( I. 22. 19), Bhār. gr. (1. 10), Māneva gr. (I. 23, 17 ) employ it in &lsquo;medhajanana&rsquo; (on the 4th day after upanayana) and Pār. gs. (II. 4) employs it at the time of putting a fuel stiok on fire. Aśv. employs the verse &lsquo;yuva suvāsaḥ&rsquo; (Rg. III. 8. 4) for making the boy turn round ( first half ) and for touching the region of the boy&rsquo;s heart (latter half ), while the same verse is employed at the time of tying the girdle round the boy&rsquo;s waist by the Mānave gr. (1. 22.8 ) and Par. 87.(II. 2).</p>
<p>Later writers went on adding mantras and details.' On the day prior to upapayana the Nāndiśrāddha was performed as said by Haradatta on Ap. gp. 10. 5. Grahamakha (&amp; sacrifoe to the planets ) also may be performed the previous day or on any day within 7 or 10 days of the upanayana. Then before the actual upanayana, there is the worship of Gapapati and of</p>

<p>Kuladavatās, punyābavācana, the worship of Matrs and the consecration of the mandapa-devatās. For the detailed modern procedure ( prayoga ) of upanayana, the 8. R. M. (pp. 197-210), which in the main follows the briefer procedure in the gfhya sūtras, may be consulted. Up to the act of making the boy dine with his mother it is the father who does everything i thereafter it is the acārya who does the rest. The samkalpa of upanayana is given below 968,</p>
<p>Yajñopavita 690 :&ndash;A few words must be said on the history of yajñopavita from ancient times. Among the earliest references is one from the Tai. S. II. 5. 11.1 &lsquo;the nivita 671 is (used in actions) for men, the prācināvita ( is used in rites ) for pitrs, the upavita (in rites ) for gods; he wears it in the upavita mode (i.e. Blung from the left shoulder ), thereby he makes &amp; distinguishing sign of the gods&rsquo;. In the Tai, Br. (I. 6. 8.) we read &lsquo;wearing in the prāolnāvita form he offers towards the south; for in the case of pitīs, acts are performed towards the south. Disregarding that one should wear in the upavita form and offer in the north only, since both gods and pitss are worshipped (in this rite)'.87 The three words nivita, prāoināvita and upavita are explained in the Gobbila gp. (I. 2. 2-4) which says&rsquo; raising his right arm, putting the head into ( the upavita ) he suspends ( the cord) over his left shoulder in such a way that it hangs down on his right side ; thus he becomes yajñopavitin.

<p>Khadira gr. I. 1. 8-9, Manu II. 63, Baud. gr. paribhasa sutra II. 2.7 and 10, Vaik. I. 5. The Baud.in gr. paribhasa-sātra II.2.3 says' when it is carried over the neck, both shoulders and the chest and is held with both the thumbs ( of the two hands ) lower than the region of the heart and above the navel, that is nivita ; (when the śruti says it is) for men, what it means is that it is for sages. The occasions when nivita mode is used are: rsi-tarpana, sexual intercourse, samskares of one&rsquo;s children except when boma is to be performed, answering the calls of nature, carrying a corpse and whatever other actions are meant only for men; nivita is what hangs from the neck'.</p>
<p>The Sat. Br. ( II. 4, 2.1, S. B. E. vol. 12, p. 361 ) says &ldquo;the gods being yajñopavitins approached near, bending their right knee; he (Prajāpati ) said to them the sacrifice is your food, immortality is your strength, the sun is your light'; then the pitrs approached bim, being prācināvitins and bending their left knee and then men approached him covered with a garment and bending their bodies&rdquo; etc.ors It is important to note here that men are said to have been covered only with a garment and there is no reference in their case to any mode of wearing either as yajñopavita or nivita or prādināvita. This rather suggests that men wore only garments when approaching gods and not necessarily a cord of threads. In the Tai.076 Br. III. 10.9. it is said that when vāk ( speech ) appeared to Devabhāga Gautama he put on the yajñopavita and fell down with the words. namo namah'.</p>

<p>Upanayana-yajstopavita</p>
<p>286</p>
<p>yajñopa vita becomes spread out ( prosperous, famous ), while the sacrifice of him who does not wear it does not spread ; whatever a brāhmaṇa studies, wearing a yajśopavita, he really (therein) performs a sacrifice. Therefore one should study, sacrifice or officiate at a sacrifice with the yajñopavita on for securing the spreading of sacrifice; having worn an antelope skin or &amp; garment on the right side, he raises the right hand and keeps the left down; this is yajāopavita; when this position is reversed it is prācināvita; the position called samvita is for men.&rsquo; It is remarkable that here at any rato no cord of threads is meant by upavita, but only a piece of skin or cloth. The Par. M. (I. part 1 p. 173 ) quotes878 a portion of the above passage and remarks that the Tai. Ār. lays down that a man becomes an upavitin by wearing one of the two, viz. antelope skin and (cotton ) garment,</p>
<p>In the Pūrvamimāmsāsūtra (III. 1.21) it is established (with reference to the words) in the Tai. S. IL. 5. 11. 1 (upayyayate eto. quoted in f. n. 671) that one has to be an upavitin throughout all the actions, prescribed in the sections on the Darsa-Purnamāsa sacrifice and not only when the Samidheni verses are recited, The first part of the same passage is discussed by Jaimini ( III. 4. 1-9) and it is established that the passage enjoins the wearing of upavita in Dars. -Pūrṇamās, which is devakarma and that the reference to prācināvita and nivita is only an anuvāda intended to enphasize the desirability of the wearing of upavita in sacri. fices to gods. The Tantravārtika 679 explains that nivita is tying the upavits round the throat like a braid of hair (according to some), while according to others it is tying it round the waist as if for girding up the loins and that the first is not done except in battle, while the latter has to be resorted to in all acts in order to depote solo attention to them. So according to the Tantravārtika, the Tai. S. is not referring (in II.5.11.1) to a cord of threads but to a piece of cloth. Some of the sūtrakāras and commentators drop hints that garments were used or could be used as upavita. Ap. Dh. S. (II. 2. 4. 22-23 ) says that a householder should always wear an upper garment and then adds&rsquo;or the sacred thread may serve the purpose of an upper garment.&rsquo; This shows that originally</p>

<p>upavita meant an upper garment and not merely a cord of threads. In another place the same sutra says (II. 8. 19.12 ) *one (who partakes of sraddha dinner) should eat covered with an upper garment slung over tha left shoulder and passing under the right arm'. Haradatta gives two explanations of this, viz. that one should wear an upper garment ( while dining at a sraddha) like a yajliopavita i. e. under the right arm and over the left shoulder, that is, a brāhmana cannot rely on Ap. Dh. S. II. 2. 4.23 and wear at sraddha repast only the sacred thread ( but he must wear the garment in that fashion) and give up the sacred thread for the time. 880 While another view is that he must wear the sacred thread and the upper gar ment both in the fashion of upavita. Ap. Dh. S. (I.2.6. 18-19) proscribes that when a student wears two garments he should wear one of them (i. e. the upper one ) in the yajdopavita mode, but when he wears only one garment then he should wear it round the lower part of the body (and should not cover the upper body with a portion of the garment though it may be long enough for that). Ap. Dh. S. I. 5. 15. 1 presoribes that a man must be yajñopavitin at the time of waiting upon teachers, elders, guests, at the time of homa, in japa (murmuring prayer), at meals and in taking āoamana and at the time of daily vedic study. On this Haradatta says&rsquo;yajñopavita means a particular mode of wearing the (upper ) garment; if one has no upper garment, then there is another ( but inferior) mode stated in Ap. Dh. S. II. 2. 4.23 and that at other times it is not necessary to have the yajñopavita'.</p>

<p>or a rope of kuśa grass&rsquo;. This indicates that though &amp; cord of threads was considered in Gobhila&rsquo;s days as the appropriate yajñopa vita, that was not an invariable rule in his day and that &amp; garment could be employed instead. The commentator being brought up in the latter day tradition explains by saying that if the sūtra was lost in a forest then &amp; garment may be worn like the sacred thread and if evon that was lost a rope of kuśa. But this appears to be rather far-fetched as an explanation of Gobhila&rsquo;s unqualified words. Manu (II. 44 ) says that the upavita of a brāhmaṇa should be made of cotton , its strands should be twined with the right hand moved over them (or the twist of the strands must be upwards) and it should have three threads&rsquo;. Medhātithi comments on this that &lsquo;upavita&rsquo; means &amp; particular mode of woaring a garment or a particular position of it and therefore bere by upavita is meant that which can be worn in that mode. The Sm. C. quotes a prose passage from Rṣyaérnga</p>
<p>or one may carry out all the purposes for which yajñopavita is required by means of a garment and in its absence by a string of three threads'. From the above passages, from the fact that many of the grbyasūtras are entirely silent about the giving or wearing of the sacred thread in upanayana and from the fact that no mantra 688 is oited from the Vedic Literature for the act of giving the yajñopa vita (which is now the centre of the upanayans rites), while soores of vedic mantras are cited for the several component parts of the ceremony of upanayana, it is most probable, if not certain, that the sacred thread was not invariably used in the older times as in the times of the later amptis and in modern times, that originally the upper garment was need in various positions for certain acts, that it could be laid aside altogether in the most ancient times and that the cord of threads oame to be used first as an option and later on exclusively for the upper garnent.</p>

<p>twisted (for each thread). Vide Baud. Db.8.1. 5.5., Devala quoted in the 8m. O. 684. The nine devatās of the nine tantus (strands ) are given by Devala viz. Omkāra, Agni, Nāga, Soma, Pitrs, Prajāpati, Vāyu, Sūrya,485 all gods. Medhātithi on Manu II.44 says that in iṣtis, animal sacrifices and soma sacrifices, the yajñopavita was to have only one thread of three tantus, but it was three-fold in three classes of ahina, ekāha, and satira sacrifices as they required three fires and in the seven somasarst has seven-fold and five-fold when viewed with reference to the three savanas and two samdbyāsThe yajaopavita should reach as far as the navel, should not reach beyond the navel, nor should it be above the chest.686 Manu II. 44 and Viṣnu Db. S. 27. 19 prescribe that the yajñopavita for brāhmaṇa, ksatriya and vaisy a should respec tively be of cotton, bemp and sheep wool. Baud. Dh. S. (I. 5.5), Gobbila gp. (I.2.1) say that it may be of cotton thread or of kuśa grass and Devala as quoted in Sm. C. says that all twice-born persons should make their yajāopavita of cotton, of kṣumā, hair of cow&rsquo;s tail, hemp, tree bark or kusa according to the availa bility of the material.087 The remarks of the Samskāramayukha after quoting Manu II. 44 are interesting &lsquo;we do not know the origin of (or authority for) the practice of present-day kṣatriyas and vaisyas, viz. of wearing cotton yajñopavita&rsquo;. This shows that in the 17th century A. D. many ksatriyas and vaisyas put on yajñopa vita.688 Kumārila also says that wearing yajśopavita and studying Vedas is common to all the three varṇas.</p>
<p>The number of yajñopavitas to be worn differed according to circumstances. A brahınacarl was to wear only one yajñopavita and samnyāsins, when they kept yajñopa vita at all, also wore</p>

<p>only one. Asnātaka 689 (i. e. one who has returned from the teacher&rsquo;s house after brahmacarya) and a house-bolder were to wear two while one who desired long life may wear more than two. Vas. Dh. S. XII. 14 days &lsquo;snatakas should always wear &amp; lower garment and an upper one, two yajñopavitas, should bave &amp; stick and &amp; pot filled with water&rsquo;. Kaśyap: allowed &amp; householder to wear any number up to ten. Whether yajñopa vita as worn in modern times was worn from the most ancient times or not, it is certain that long before the Christian era it had come to be so worn and it had become an inflexible rule that a brābmana must always wear &amp; yajñopavita and have his top-knot (of hair) always tied up; if he did any act without observing this rule, it was inefficacious.690 Vas.691 and Baud, Dh. 8. ( II. %. 1) both say that a man must always wear yajñopavita. If a brāhmaṇa took his meals without wearing yajñopavita, he had to undergo prāyaścitts viz. to bathe, to mutter prayers and fast; vide Laghu-Harita verse 23 quoted by Aparārks pp. 1171, 1173. The Mit, on Yāj. III, 292 prescribes prāyaścitta for answering calls of nature without having the yajñopavite placed on the right ear ( as Yāj. I, 16 prescribes). Manu IV. 66 forbids the wearing of another&rsquo;s yajõopayita along with several other things (such as shoes, ornament, garland and kamaṇdalu). In Yāj. ( I. 16 and 133) and other smrtis the yajñopavita is called brahmasūtra.</p>

<p>Hārstadbarmasūtra as quoted in the Sm. O. and other digeste says &lsquo;there are two sorts of women, those that are brabma vādinis ( i. e. students of sacred lore) and those that are sadyo vadhūs ( i. e, who straightway marry ). Out of these brahma. Vādinis have to go through upanayana, keeping fire, vedio study and begging in one&rsquo;s house ( i. e. under the parental roof); but in the case of sadyovadbūs when their marriage is drawing near, the mere ceremony of upanayans should somehow be performed and then their marriage should be celebrated.&rsquo; In the Gobhila gp. 6o3 II. 1. 19 it is said &quot; leading forward towards the sacred fire (from the house ) the bride who is wrapped in a robe and wears the sacred thread (slung from her left shoulder, in the yajñopavita mode ) he (the busband ) should murmur the verse. Soma gave her to Gandharva' ( Rg. X. 85. 41 )&rdquo;. It is clear that the girl, according to Gobhila, wore the yajñopavits as a symbol of the rite of upanayana. The com mentator to whom this procedure naturally seemed strange explains&rsquo;yajñopavitinimas meaning whose upper garment is worn in the fashion of the sacred thread'. In the Samskāra tattvā of Raghunandana it is stated that Hariśarmā held that according to Gobhila the bride was to wear &amp; yajopa vita, though Raghunandana himself does not approve of this expla. nation. In the ceremony of Samāvartana, Āśy, gr. III. 8, 694 on the subjeot of applying ointment says' after baving smeared the two hands with ointment a brāhmana should selve his face first, a ksatriya his two arms, &amp; vaiśya his belly, a woman her private parts and persons who gain their live lihood by running, their thighs'. It is improper to say, as some do, that as to women this is a general rule inter polated in the treatment of samāvartana and has nothing to do with the latter. We should rather hold that Asv. knew of women undertaking Vedio study and 80 presoribed what they should do in their samāvartana. In the Mahābhārata (Vanaparva 305. 20)*&rsquo;s a brāhmaṇa is said to have taught to the</p>

<p>mother of the Pandava heroes a number of mantras from the Atharvasiras. Hārlta&rsquo;s prescribes that in the case of women Bamāvartana took place before the appearance of menses. There fore brahmavādini women had upanayana performed in the 8th year from oonception, then they studied Vedio lore and finished student-bood at the age of puberty. Yama®&rdquo; says &lsquo;in former ages, tying of the girdle of muñja (i. e. upanayans ) was desired in the case of maidens, they were taught the vedes and made to recite the Sāvitri ( the sacred Gayatri verse ); either their father, uncle or brother taught them and not a stranger and begging was presoribed for a maiden in the house itself and she was not to wear deer-skin or bark garment and was not to have matted hair&rsquo;. Manu seems to have been aware of this usage as prevalent in ancient tiines, if not his own. Having spoken of the samskāras from jātakarma to upanayana, Manu winds up ( II. 66 ) &lsquo;these ceremonies were to be performed in their entirety for women also, but without mantras&rsquo; and adds ( II. 67 ) * the ceremony of marriage is the only saṁskāra per formed with Vedio mantras in the case of women; (in their case ) attendance on the husband amounts to serving a guru (which a student had to do) and performance of domestio duties to worship of fire' (which the student had to perform by offering a fuel-stick in the evening every day ). This shows that in the day of the Manusmrti, upanayana for women had gone out of practice, though there were faint glimmerings of its perform ance for women in former days. Relying on the words &lsquo;in former ages&rsquo; occurring in the verses of Yama quoted above medieval digests like the Sm. C., the Nirnayasindhu and others say that this practice belonged to another yuga. In Baṇa. bhatta&rsquo;s Kadambari,498 Mabāśvetā (who was practising tapas) is described as one whose body was rendered pure bs (wearing) a brahmasūtra (i. e. yajñopavita )'.

<p>(p. 419 ) quotes a verso saying that the Supreme Being is called yajña and yajśopavita is so called because it belongs to the Supreme Being (or is used in sacrifices for Him ).699</p>
<p>Though ksatriyas and vaiśgas also were entitled to have the upanayana performed, it appears that they often neglected it or at least neglected the constant wearing of yajñopayita, so much so that from comparatively early times the yajñopavita came to be regarded as the peculiar indicator of the wearer&rsquo;s being of tbe brābmana caste. For example, Kalidasa in Raghuvamsa (XI. 64 ) 700 while describing the irate brāhmaṇa hero Paragu rāma says wearing the upavita, which was the heritage that came to him froin his father, and holding a formidable bow that came to him from the side of his mother (who was &amp; kṣatriya princess). If the upavita had been as constantly worn by the kṣatriyas as by brāhmaṇas in Kalidāsa&rsquo;s day he would not have spoken of it as the peculiar sign of a brāhmaṇa, In the drama Venisamhāra ( Act III) when Karna resented the attitude of Aśvatthaman, who raised his left foot for kicking Karna, and said that he could not cut off his leg as by virtue of his caste (as brāhmana ) he could not be punished in that way, Aśvattha man replied by throwing away his sacred thread with the words &lsquo;here do I give up my caste&rsquo;.701 That shows that in the days of the Venisambāra ( not later than about 600 A. D.) the yajñopavita had become the peculiar indicator of the caste of brahmanas only.</p>
<p>The Baudhāyana-sutra quoted in the Samskāra-ratnamālā (p. 188 ) says that yarn spun by a brālmana or his maiden daughter is to be brought, then one is to measure first 96 angulas of it with the syllable bhūḥ, then another 96 with bhuvah and a third 96 with svah, then the yarn so measured is to be kept on a leaf of palāsa and is to be sprinkled with water to the accompaniment of the three mantras &ldquo;āpo hi sthā' (Rg. X. 9. 1-3), with the four verses &lsquo;Hiranyavarṇāb&rsquo; ( Tai, S. V, 6.1 and Atharva I. 33. 1-4 ) and with the anuvāka beginning with &lsquo;pavamānaḥ suvarjapaḥ &lsquo;( Tai. Br. I. 4.8) and with the Gāyatri, then the yarn is to be taken in the left hand and there is to be a clapping of the two handa thrice, the yarn is to be twisted</p>

<p>The Baudhayana-gphyasesasūtra (II. 8. 1-12 ) gives a few insignificant points of difference as to the upanayana of ksatriyas, vaisyas, ambastha and karaña (son of a vaisya from a sūdra female). It is not necessary to go into these details.</p>
<p>The next important question is as to whether upanayana was performed in the case of the blind, the deaf and dumb, the idiotic &amp;c. Jaimini has established that those who are devoid of a limb708 are not eligible for agnihotra, but this inability arises only when the defeot is incurable. Similarly the Ap. Dh.S. II. 6. 14. 1, Gaut. 28. 41-42, Vas. 17, 52-54, Manu 9. 201, Yāj. II. 140-141, Viṣnu. Db. S. 15. 32 ff. lay down that persons who are impotent, palita, congenitally blind or deaf, cripple and those who suffer from incurable diseases are not entitled to share property on a partition, but are only entitled to be maintained. But they all allow even these to marry. As marriage is not possible for dvijatis unless upanayana precedes it, it appears that the core. mony of upanayana was gone through as far as it could be carried out in the case of the blind, the deaf and dumb &amp;o. The Baud. gr. seṣasūtra (II. 9) prescribes a special procedure for the upanayana of the deaf and dumb and idiots. The principal</p>

<p>points in which their upanayana differs from that of others are that the offering of samidh, treading on a stone, putting on a garment, the tying of mekhala, the giving of deer skin and staff are done silently, that the boy does not mention his Dame, it is the doārya himself who makes offerings of cooked food or of clarified butter, all the mantras are muttered softly by the ācārya himself. The sūtra yot gaya that according to some the same procedure is followed as to other persons who are impotent, blind, lunatics, or suffering from such diseases as epilepsy, white leprosy or black leprosy &amp;c. The Nirnayasindhu quotes a passage from the Brahmapuriṇa cited in the Prayogaparijata about the upangyana of the impotent, the deaf and others which contains rules similar to Baudhāyana&rsquo;s. The Sam. Pr. (pp. 399-401) and S. R. M. (pp. 273-274 ) also quote the passage and explain it. The purāna 90$ says that those who cannot repeat the Gayatri ( such as the deaf and dumb ) should be brought near the teacher or fire and that the teacher should then touch them and then mutter the Gayatri himself, but tbat in other cases such as lunatics, they should be made to repeat the Gāyatri at least if possible and if that too is not possible, then on touching them the acārya should repeat it. The game purana prescribes that kunda and golaka (the first being the offspring of an adulterous intercourse when the husband of the woman is living and the second when the husband is dead) should have upanayana performed in the same way as for the deaf and dumb, if it is known that the adulterer and the woman were both of the brābmana caste. There is some difference of opinion as to kunda and golaka. Manu (II. 174) defined them as above. Ap. Dh. S, II. 6. 13. 1, Manu (10.5) and Yaj. (I. 90, 92 ) 706 expressly say that a person born of a brāhmaṇa from a brahmana woman belongs to the same caste only if he is born in lawful wedlook and that even the anuloma sons must be born in wedlock. The kunda and golaka being the offspring of adultery</p>

<p>would not really be brāhmaṇas even though both parents were brahmanas. Thus, though these two are not strictly brāhmaṇas, upanayana of a secondary kind is allowed to them. Manu (III. 156 ) included the kunda and golaka among brābmanas not to be invited at śrāddha. Elaborate discussions have been held why they were so specially mentioned, when they were not on Manu&rsquo;s own dictum brāhmaṇas. Some like the author of the Samgraha held that the kunda and golaka forbidden by Manu in sraddha were those born under the ancient practice of niyoga; while others repudiated the idea that those born under the practice of niyoga had any taint attaching to them.709</p>
<p>It is not necessary to go into the question of the upanayana of mixed castes. Manu ( X. 41 ) says that the six anulomas are eligible for the rites of drijas (and so for upanayana ) and the Mit.Pos on Yaj. I. 9% and 95 says that the anulomas have upanayana performed according to the rules of the oaste of the mother and further mixed castes arising from the six anuloma castes in the anuloma order are also eligible for upanayana. The Baud. gr. seṣasūtra II. 8 gives rules for the upana yana of kṣatriyas, vaisyas and of mixed castes like rathakara, ambaṣtba &amp;c. Gaut.709 IV. 21 made an exception in the case of the son of a brāhmaṇa from a sūdra woman. All pratilomas were like sūdra according to Manu (IV. 41 ) and the offspring of a brāhmaṇa from a sūdra woman, though anuloma, was like pratilomas. A śūdra is only ekajāti and not dvijāti (Gaut. X. 51) and for the pratilomas ( 88 well as for the gūdra ) there was no upanayana.</p>
<p>Upanayana was so highly thought of that some of the ancient texts prescribe a method of upanayans for the Asvattha treo. Vide Baud. gs. seṣasūtra II, 10. In modern times algo rarely this upanayana is performed. To the west of the Asvattha tree homa is performed, the samskāras from pumsavana are imitated but with the vyabrtis only, the tree being touched with R&amp;. III.</p>

<p>Savitryupadesa - It will be seen from the passage of the Sat. Br. quoted above (in note 625) that the sacred Gayatri verse was imparted in very apoient times to the student by the teacher 8 year, or six months, 24, 12 or 3 days after upanayana and that the Sat. Br. prescribes that in the case of brāhmaṇa students this must be done immediately. This ancient rule was probably due to the fact that students in those far-off times when they came to the teacher at the age of seven or eight had hardly any previous instruction and so must have found it difficult to pronounce properly and correotly the sacred verse immediately on initiation. It is for this reason that so modern &amp; work as the S. R. M. (p. 194) says that such mantras As &lsquo;San-no devirabhiṣtaye&rsquo; (Rg. X. 9. 4) which have to be repeated by the brahmacārl in the rites of upanayana should be taught to him even before upanayana, just as the wife (who being a woman had no upanayana performed ) was taught the Vedio mantras accompanying such acts as that of examining ajya in sacrifices.710 The same rule of postponing the instruc tion in Gayatri is stated in Sān. gr. II. 5, Mānava gṛ. I. 22. 15, Bhār. gṛ. I. 9, Pār. gṛ. II. 3. The general practice however seems to have been to impart the Gayatri that very day. According to most of the sūtras the teacher sits to the north of the fire facing the east and in front of him the student sits facing the west and then the student requests the teacher to recite to him the Verse sacred to Savitr and the toacher imparts to him first one pāda at a time, then two pādas and then the whole.

Various intricate modes occur in the sūtras and the commentaries thereon about how this first instruction in Gāyatri is to be carried out. The differences are due to the place assigned to the vyābrtis713 °( bbūḥ, bhuvaḥ, svaḥ ). Two illustrations are set out below from Sudarśana 714 on Ap. gr. II. 11.

<p>beaven; therefore one who is about to study the Veda, should start his study by first repeating om.&rsquo; Manu (II. 74 ) prescribes the repetition of pranava at the beginning and at the end of daily Vedio study and further on (II. 76 ) says that the three letters &lsquo;a&rsquo;, &lsquo;u&rsquo;,&rsquo;m&rsquo;(in om) and the three vyābftis were distilled from the three vedas by Prajāpati as the essence. Medbātitbi on Manu (II. 74 ) says that &lsquo;om must be uttered at the begin. ning of the daily Vedio study by the student or by the house holder ( when performing brahmayajña ), but it is not necessary in japa&rsquo; &amp;o. In the Mārkandeya-purāṇa chap. 4%, Vayu chap. 20, Vṭddha-Harsta-smrti VI. 59-62 and in numerous other places there are hyperbolical or esoterio identifications of the three letters of om with Viṣnu, Lakṣmi and the jive, with the three Vedas, with the three worlds, with three fires &amp;o. In the Kathopaniṣad I. 2. 15-17 om is said to be the end of all Vedas, the source of the knowledge of brahma and also its symbol.</p>
<p>The sacred Gayatri verse is Rg. III. 62. 10 and oocurs in the other Vedas also. It is addressed to Savitr (the sun) and may also be interpreted as a prayer to the Source and Inspirer of everything. It literally means &lsquo;we contemplate that esteemed (longed for) refulgence ( glory ) of the divine Savitr who may inspire our intellects (or actions)&rsquo;. Some gṭhya sūtras prescribe the same vorge for all students, whether brāhmaṇas, kṣatriyas or vaisyas. But others say that for brāhmana the Sāvitrl verse is the Gāyatri, but for ksatriyas and vaisyas, a sāvitri ( verse addressed to Savitr) in the Triṣçubh (having 11 syllables in each quarter) or Jagati (12 syllables in each quarter ) should be the proper one. Here again there is difference. According to the commentators on the Kathaka gr. (41.20 ), the verge &lsquo;adabdhebhiḥ savita&rsquo;( Kathakam IV. 10) and the verge Viśvā rūpāpi' (Kathakam XVI. 8) are cited as the Savitri for a kṣatriya and a vaisya respectively; while the commentator on</p>
<p>Sān. gr. (II. 5. 4-6) says that the Trisṭubh which is to be taught as the Sāvitri to the kṣatriya students is &lsquo;&amp; kṛṣpena rajasā&rsquo;</p>
<p>Rg. I. 35. 2) and the Jagati Savitri for the valấya is. Hiranya pāṇiḥ savita' (Rg. I. 35. 9 ) or hamsaḥ śuciṣad' (Rg. IV. 40. 5). According to the Vārabagļhya (5) &lsquo;devo yāti savita&rsquo; and &lsquo;yuñjate manaḥ&rsquo;(Rg. V. 81.1) are the Triṣtubh and Jagat meant as Savitri for the kṣatriya and vaisya respectively. According to Satatapa quoted in the Madanapārijāta (p. 23) the verse ' Deva savitaḥ' (Tai. S. I. 7.7.1, Kathakam XIII. 14) is the sāvitri for the ksatriya. According to Medbātithi on Manu II. 38 : &amp; krsñena ( Rg. I. 35. 2 ) and &lsquo;visva rūpāṇi&rsquo; ( Kathakam XVI. 8)</p>
<p>Oh. VII)</p>
<p>Upanayana and the Gāyatri</p>
<p>303</p>
<p>are the two Sāvitris respectively for ksatriya and vaibya. That all these rules about the Sāvitrī being in the Gayatri, Tristubh and Jagati metres for the three varnas respectively are probably very ancient follows from the text &lsquo;gāyatrgā brāhmaṇamassajata triṣtubbā rājanyam &amp;c.&rsquo; (quoted in note 356 above). The Asv. gr., Āp. gr., and some other gūtras are entirely silent on the point, while Pār, gr. II. 3 allows an option viz, all varnas may learn the Gāyatri or the Savitri verses in the Gayatri, Tristubh and Jagati respectively. Why the Gāyatri verse (Rg. III. 62. 10) came to be famous it is difficult to say. Its fame was probably due to its grand simplicity and to its adaptability to an idealistic conception of the world as emanating from an all-pervading Intelligence. The Gopatha Brābmana (I. 32-33 ) explains the Gāyatri in various ways. In the Tai. Ār. (II. 11 ) it is stated that the mystio words&rsquo;bhūḥ. bhuvah, svaḥ' are the truth (essence) of speech and that Savita in the Gayatri means &lsquo;one who en. genders glory,96 Atharvaveda 19. 71. 1 calls it vedamata&rsquo; and prays that it may confor long life, glory, children, cattle</p>
<p>&amp;c, on the singer.717 The Br. Up. V, 14. 1-6718 contains a sublime eulogy of Gāyatri which word is there derived from &lsquo;gaya&rsquo; meaning prāṇa', and the root &lsquo;trai&rsquo; ( to save ) and it is said that when the teacher repeats the Gāyatri for the benefit of the young student be thereby saves the boy&rsquo;s life (from ignorance and the effects of sin). The Āp. Dh. S. I. 1. 1. 10 montions a brahmana text to the effect that the Savitri is recited for all the Vedas ( i.e. by its recital all Vedas become recited as it is their essence ). Manu II. 77 ( =Vispu Dh. S. 55. 14 ) says that each pada of the Savitri was as if extracted from each of the three Vedas and that ( II. 81=Viṣnu Dh. S. 55, 15 ) the Savitri together with om and the three mystic syllables (bhūḥ &amp;o.) is the mouth of Vedio lore (sinoe Vedio study starts with it, or &lsquo;brabna may mean &lsquo;the Supreme Being&rsquo;).

<p>Bphat-Parāśara chap. V (where the mystical significance of each of the 24 letters of the Gāyatri is explained ) and numerous?i! other works contain hyperbolical eulogies of Gayatri. Parāśara V.1 calls it &lsquo;Vedamata&rsquo;. The words&rsquo;Apo jyoti rasonrtam brahina bhur-bhuvah svarom' are said to be the tiras (head) of the Gaya tri (vide Saṅkhasmrti XII. 12). Manu (II.104) and others pres cribe that every day &amp; brahmacāri ( as well as others) must per form japa of Gayatrl, Baud. Dh. S. II 4. 7-9 prescribes that in the evening Sandhyā adoration one should murmur the Gāyatri a thousand times, or a hundred times with prāṇāyāma each time or ten times with &lsquo;om&rsquo; and the seven vyahrtis.780 Vas. Dh. S. 26. 15 proscribes that a man desirous of purifying himself from sin should repeat the divine Gayatri 1000 times (daily) as the maxi mum or 100 times (as the middle way) or at least ten times. There are mantras for invoking the Gāyatri and for taking leave of it.7'!</p>
<p>Brahmacāri-dharmāḥCertain rules and observances are prescribed for all brahmacārins 7%, They are of two kinds, some are pregoribed for a very short time and some have to be observed for all the years of studenthood, The Asv.gr. I. 22.17 783 says &quot; for three nights, or twelve nights or 8 year after upanayana</p>

<p>Upanayına and brahmacāridharma</p>
<p>305</p>
<p>the brahmacāri should not eat&rsquo; kṣāra&rsquo; and &lsquo;lavana&rsquo; and should sleep on the ground&rdquo;. The same rule is stated by Baud. gr. II. 5. 55 ( adding the maintenance of the fire kindled at the upanayana for three days), Bhār. gr. I. 10, Pār. gr. II. 5, Kbūdira gr. II. 4. 33 (adding avoidance of milk also for three days). Hir. gr. ( I. 8. 2 ) specially prescribes for the first three days the avoidance of kṣāra, of lavana and vegetables, and the duty of sleeping on the ground, of not drinking out of an earthen vessel, of not giving the remnants of his food to śūdras and several other observances which he has to continue throughout the period of student-hood. These latter are briefly indicated in Manu II. 108 and 176 viz. offering samidhs into fire, begging for food, not using a cot, working for the teacher, daily bath, tarpana of gods, sages and pitṛs &amp;c.</p>
<p>The observances that last throughout the period of student hood are first seen in the passage of the Sat. Br. (quoted above in note 625 ). The same are laid down in Aśv, gr, I, 22.2 ( quoted on p. 283 above), Pār. gr. II. 3, Āp. Mantrapātha (II. 6. 14), Kathaka gr. ( 41. 17 ) and other texts. These are principally acamana, guruśusrūṣā, vāksaiyama (silence), samidādhāna. When the teacher says in the upanayana&rsquo; drink water, do work &amp;c', the student is to reply with the word &lsquo;yes&rsquo; (&lsquo;bādham&rsquo; or om ). But the gūtras and emptis lay down many rules about these and other observances; vide Gaut. II, 10-40, Sān. gr. II. 6.8, Gobhila gr. III. 1.27, Khādira gr. II. 5. 10-16, Hir. gr. 8.1-7, Ap. Dh. S, I. 1. 3. 11-1.2.7. 30, Baud. Dh. S. I. %, Manu II. 49-249, Yāj. I. 16-32 &amp;o. The rules centre principally round agnipa ricaryā (worshipping fire), bhikṣā (begging for food ), samdhyopāsana, study of Veda and its methods and duration, avoidance of certain foods and drinks and other matters like singing &amp;o., guruśusrūṣa ( including honouring him and his family and other elders ), and the special vratas of the brabma cāri. These principal topics will be dealt with in some detail now. Before doing so some other matters will have to be briefly disposed off.</p>

<p>it was supposed that the student&rsquo;s intellect was made capable of mastering Vedic lore. A$v. gr. I. 22. 18-19 deals with this. The teacher makes the student sprinkle water in an unobjectionable direction thrice from the left to the right with a pot of water round about a palāśa tree that has one root, or round a bunch of kuśa grass if there is no palāśa, and makes him repeat the mantra &lsquo;Oh glorious one, thou art glorious. As thou, glorious one, are glorious, thus, glorious one, make me full of glory. As thou art the preserver of the treasure of sacrifice for the gods, thus may I become the preserver of the treasure of Veda among men°725. The Bhār. gr. (1. 10 ) also prescribes this rite on the fourth day after upanayana and says that &amp; palāśa tree with one root is to be anointed with ājya and the mantra</p>
<p>suśravaḥ&rsquo; (the same as in Āśv.) is to be muttered. Kathaka gr. 41. 18, Mānava gr. I. 22. 17 also refer to this. The Sam. Pr. (pp. 444-446) gives a more elaborate des cription. In addition to what is stated in Asv. gr. it quotes from Saunaka and adds a few more details, viz. the student deposits at the root of the palāśa his garments already worn, the staff and the girdle and then wears new ones and then when the boy returns to the house, a stream of water is poured before him. The teacher takes the garments &amp;c. left by the boy. The Āp. gr. 11. 24 says that on the fourth day the teacher takes the garments worn on the day of upanayang by the student and the boy wears new ones. Sudarsana on Ap. 11. 24 speaks of palāśa-karms on the fourth day. The boy goes out with his ācārya to the east or north and three sthapdilas are prepared to the north or east of a palāsa tree and on these three pranava ( om ), sraddhā and medha are invoked, are worshipped with unguents, flowers, lamp &amp;c. (as in the regular worship of an image ), then the pranava is worshipped with the formula &lsquo;yas-chandasām&rsquo; to &lsquo;śrutam me gopaya&rsquo; (Tai. Up. I.4.1), sraddha with the hymn&rsquo;sraddhayāgniḥ &lsquo;Rg. X. 151 and Medhā with the anuvāka &lsquo;Medhā devi&rsquo; (Tai. Ār. X, 39 ). Then the staff is deposited at the foot of the palāśa, another staff is taken and the student returns to the house with the acārya. In modern times in the Deccan a similar ceremony is gone through under the (Marathi) name &lsquo;Palasula&rsquo;.</p>

<p>Upanayana anıl brahmacūridharma</p>
<p>3017</p>
<p>We have seen above that the student has to offer samidh (fuel stick) into the fire on the day of upanayana. The fire kindled at the time of upanayana was to be kept up for three days and the fuel-stioks were offered in that fire during those days. Afterwards samidh was to be offered in the ordinary fire ( vide Baud. gr. II. 5. 55-57, Ap. gr. 11.22). The student is required to offer every day after upanayana a samidb into fire in the evening and in the morning. Asv. gß. I. 22. 6 prescribes this and the commentator Nārāyaṇa adds that in so doing he bas to observe the procedure prescribed in Asv. gr. I. 20.10-1. 21. 4 for the putting on of samidh on the first day. Sān, gr. II. 10, Manu II. 186, Yāj. I. 25 and almost all others prescribe the offering of samidh into fire in the evening as well as in the morning ; but Ap. Dh. 8. I. 1. 4. 17 notes that according to some &ldquo;agnipāja&rsquo; was to be performed in the evening only. Ap. Dh. S. (1. 1. 4. 14-20) lays down the following rules : &lsquo;the student 786 should always bring fuel from the forest and heap it on a low place (otherwise if placed high it may fall on anybody&rsquo;s head), one should not go out after sunset for bringing fuel-sticks. Hav. ing kindled fire, having swept round it he should offer fuel-sticks in the evening and the morning as already directed ( in the grhyasūtra). One should sweep round the fire that is burning red-hot with the hand and not with a broom (of kusa grass ).&rsquo; The Ap. Dh. S, I. 5. 15. 12 further prescribes that no fuel is to be placed on fire ( in srauta and smārta rites ) unless water has been sprinkled over it. The student had not only to offer samidhs on his own account into the fire, but he had to help his ācārya in the latter&rsquo;s worship of fire by bringing fuel and by offering oblations for his acārya when the latter was away on a journey or was ill. The ĀŚv. gļ. I. 9. 1 says727 beginning from marriage a householder should worship gļhya fire himself or his wife or son or maiden daughter or pupil may do so.' The Chandogya Up. IV. 10 contains the story of Upakosala Kama layang who was a student of Satyakama Jābala and looked after his teacher&rsquo;s fires for twelve years and whom Satyakāma did not teach anything, though the wife of Satyakāma interceded on behalf of the dejected pupil.</p>

<p>A few words about samidhs may be said here. The samidh 788 must be of palāśa or some other yajñiya tree ( used in sacrifices ). Such trees are palaga, asvattha, nyagrodha, plakṣa, vaikankata, udumbara, bilva, candana, sarala, sala, devadaru and khadira. The Vayupurāṇa quoted by Aparārka (p. 51 ) says that palāśa samidhs should be preferred, in their absence samidhs of khadira, in the absence of the first two, of sami, rohitaka and asvattha and in the absence of all these of arka and vetase. The Trikānda-mandana (II. 82-84 ) has several rules on this point. The principal trees for fuelsticks (samidh ) are palāśa and khadirs, but samidhs of kovidāra, bibbitaka, kapittha, karabha, rāja vṛkṣa, sakadruma, nipa, nimba, karañja, tilaka, śleṣmātaka or sālmali are not to be employed. The samidh was not to be thicker than the thumb, was to have its bark on it, was not to be worm-eaten nor divided, nor longer nor shorter than the span (prādesa ) nor having two branches, it was to be without leaves and was to be strong. 2. According to Hārita &lsquo;when death wanted to seize the brahmacāri formerly, Agni saved him from death and so a brahmacāri should serve fire.730</p>
<p>The number of samidhs varied as shown above and not only in the worship of Agni by the brahmacāri, but also else where.</p>
<p>Bhikṣā:&ndash;The Āśv, gr. after presoribing begging for food states (I. 22. 7-8) that the student should first beg of a man who would not refuse or of a woman who would not refuse and that in begging he should say &lsquo;sir, give food&rsquo;. More detailed rules are laid down by others.</p>

II. 5. 47-53 gives the same rules and adds 731 that a brāhmana student should beg with the words' bhavati bhiksām dehi' (lady, give me food), a ksatriya with the words &lsquo;bhikṣām bhavati debi&rsquo; and a vaisya with the words &lsquo;debi bhiksām bhavati.&rdquo; Pār. gr.

II. 5 says that the student should first bog of three women who would not refuse or of six, of twelve or of an unlimited number and that acoording to some he should first beg of his mother. Manu IL, 50 says that he should first beg of his mother, sister or mother&rsquo;s sister. Ap. Dn. S. I. 1. 3. 26 says that if womon refuse to give alms to 8 devout brahmacarl he snatohes away or destroys their merit arising from sacrifices, gifts and burnt offerings, progeny, cattle, spiritual glory (of their families ) and food and quotes a Brāhmana passage therefore indeed one should not refuse to give food to a orowd of students moving about (for alms ) for fear that among them there may be some one who is like this (a devout student), and who has carried out all the observanoes for students. If a brahmavārl cannot get food elsewhere he may beg from his own family, from his elders (like maternal uncles), his relatives and lastly from his acārya himself. As to the persons 138 from whom to beg for food, one sees how the growing strictness of oaste rules about food during the lapse of centuries affected the brahmaoāri. Ap. Dh.

<p>he could beg food from anybody except apapātras (persons like capdālas ) and abhiśastas (i. e. those who are guilty of or suspected of grave sins). Gaut. II. 41 expressly says that a brahmacārs may beg food from all the varṇas except from those who are abhiśasta and palita. Manu (II. 183 and 185 ) says a brahmacāri should beg for food at the houses of those who study the Veda and perform sacrifices, who are devoted to their duties and are virtuous in their conduct; if from such persons food cannot be had he may go about the whole village, but should avoid those who are abhisasta. Yāj. I. 29 says &lsquo;for his own maintenance a brahmacārl should beg food from brāhma ṇas who are blameless&rsquo; and the ancient commentator Visvarūpe says that the best way is to beg at brāhmapa houses, the next best is to beg of kṣatriya and vaiśya houses and to beg of kūdras is allowed only in āpad (time of distress or difficulty). Ausa nasa (Jiv, ed I. p. 505 ) says that a brahmacāri should beg only from houses of bis own caste ( as the best way probably ) or he may beg at the houses of all varpas, while Aögiras quoted in the Par. M. (1. 2, p. 41 ) says that even in a season of distress &amp; brahmacāri should not beg for cooked food from gūdras, The Madanepārijāta p. 33 quotes a passage from the Bhaviṣyapurana to the effect that a brahmacāri may beg food from anybody except a sūdra.</p>
<p>Food obtained by begging was supposed to be pure as said by Manu II. 189, Baud. Dh. S. I, 5, 56 and Yāj. I. 187. It was further said that a brahmaoāri who subsists on food obtained by begging is like one observing a fast (Manu II. 183 and Bphat-Parāgara p. 130 ). The brahmacārl was to eat food collected from several houses and was not to take food at a single person&rsquo;s house, except that when he was requested to dinner in honour of gods or the Manes he might do so by partak</p>
<p>(Continued from last page) dourde was possible), while on 31. . I.1.3. 25 he explains 479 as</p>
<p>HAUTAT: TWITC9&rsquo;. The word literally neans those who cannot be allowed to use tho vessels out of whicb members of other castes are to take food (i, e, those vessels when used by them have to be broken or thrown away). Spero p. 720 explains 37997 as afarer mat en: (i. o. one who has lost caste through the commission of some mortal sin). According to Ap. Dh. 8. I. 9. 24, 7-9 an abhijasta is one that kills any brahmana or kills a brahmana woman who is Atreyi. According to Ap. Db. 8.1,7. 21. 8 abbigastya' is one of the grave sins and is explained by T as TT, but explains of STRAT: 08 OTTI on . II. 41.</p>

<p>ing of such food at such dinners as would not violate his TOWB. Vide Manu II. 188-189 and Yāj. I. 32.</p>
<p>Corresponding to the duty of the student to beg was the obligation cast on householders to serve food according to their ability to brahmacūrins and yatis ( ascetics ). Gautama V. 16 prescribes that after performing the daily yajñas to gods ( vaisvadeva ) and offering bali to bhūtas, the householder should offer alms (of food ) preceded by the word &lsquo;svasti&rsquo; and by water. Manu III. 94, Yāj. I. 108 and others say that alıns should be given to ascetics and brahmavārins with honour and welcome. The Mit. on Yāj. I. 108 says that alms should be ordinarily one morsel of food as large as the egg of &amp; pea-hen and quotes a verse of Satātapa735 saying that&rsquo;bhikṣā is as much as one morsel, that puṣkala is equal to four morgels, hanta is equal to four puṣkalas and agra is equal to three hantas.'</p>
<p>The idea that a bralmanāri must beg for his food and offor fuel-sticks every day was so ingrained in ancient times that the Baud. Db. S. I. 2. 54 and Menu II. 187 ( = Viṣnu Dh. S. 28. 52 ) prescribe that if for seven days continuously a brahma cārl who was not ill failed to offer fuel-sticks and to beg for food he violated his vow and had to undergo the same penance as was prescribed for a brahmacārl having sexual intercourse.738 Even in modern times many brāhmaṇa students (not only those who study the Ved&amp; from orthodox teachers but even those learning English) begged for their daily food and by dint of hard discipline, patient industry and integrity rose to high positions in public life. However the practice of poor begging students attending English schools in this way is dying out, since English education does not now onsure for the poor brāhmaṇa students even a bare maintenance.</p>
<p>Other important rules about the begging of food are that the student should not beg for his sake alone, should announce</p>

<p>to the teacher all that he has brought and eat only that which the teacher directs him to take; if the teacher is gone on a journey then he should announce it to the teacher&rsquo;s family ( wife, son ); if even these are absent, then to other learned brahmanas and eat with their permission. Vide Āp. Db. S. I. 1. 3. 31-35, Manu II. 51. He should leave no residue in his dish and wash it after taking his meal therein. If he is not able to eat the whole that he has brought he should bury it underground or consign it to water or place that which is more than he can eat near an ārya or give it to a sūdra who works for his teacher (Āp. Dh. S, I. 1. 3. 37-41). Ap. Dh. S. (I, 1. 3. 43-44) says that alms are held to be equal to sacrificial food, the teacher holds the place of the deity and of the ābavaniya fire, 737</p>
<p>Other miscellaneous acts that the students had to do were bringing 738 water for the acārya in pots, collecting flowers, cowdung, earth, kus&amp; grass &amp;o. ( vide Manu II. 182 ).</p>
<p>Sandhya:-On the day of upanayana there is no morning saidhyā. Jaimini 734 says &lsquo;as long as there is no imparting of the Gayatri there is no sandhya.&rsquo; So the student begins bis samdbya in the noon of the day of upanayana. As however on that day he knows no Vedic text except the Gāyatri, his whole samdhyā worship consists of the Gāyatri,</p>
<p>The word &lsquo;samdhya&rsquo; literally means &lsquo;twilight&rsquo;, but also indicates the action of prayer performed in the morning and evening twilight. This act is generally styled &lsquo;samdhyopāsana&rsquo; or &lsquo;samdhyāvandana&rsquo; or simply &lsquo;sandhya.&lsquo;740 This act of adoration is sometimes prescribed as necessary thrice a day viz. at day-break, in the noon and at sun-set e.g. Atri74) gays&rsquo;&amp; twice born person possessed of the knowledge of the Self should perform three gamdhy&amp; adorations.&rsquo; These are respectively named Gāyatri ( morning one), Savitri ( noon) and Sarasvati</p>

<p>( evening one) by Yoga-yājāavalkya. Generally however the sandhya prayer is prescribed twice ( Aśv. gr. III. 7, Ap. Dh. S. I. 11. 30. 8, Gaut. II. 17, Manu II. 101, Yaj. I. 24-25 &amp;o).</p>
<p>All prescribe that the morning 748 prayer is to be begun before sunrise and should be carried on till the disc of the sun is seen on the horizon and the evening prayer begins when the diso of the sun is about to set and goes on up to the appearance of stars. This is the most proper time; but a secondary time was allowed up to three ghatikās after sunrise and sun-set. The duration of the prayer each time was to be one muhūrta ( i. e. two ghatikās, according to Yoga-yājāavalkya )</p>
<p>whatever the length of the day may be. 743 Manu (IV. 93-94) however recommends the prayer to extend as long as one could afford, since the ancient sages seoured long life, intelligence, glory, fame and spiritual eminence by long samdhyā prayers.***</p>
<p>According to inost writers japa of Gayatri and other sacred mantras is the principal thing in sandhya and other things such as mārjana are merely subsidiary, but Medhātithi on Manu II. 101 ( where the words are &lsquo;japanstiṣthet&rsquo; and not * tiṣthan japet&rsquo;) says that japa is subsidiary or secondary and the place of the prayer and the posture of the praying person are the principal items. When it is said &lsquo;one should perform the sandhya&rsquo; what is meant is that one should contemplate the deity called Aditya represented by the orb of the sun and should also contemplate on the fact that the same Intelligence dwells in his heart. The proper place for samdhyā prayer is outside the village ( Ap. Dh. 8. I. 11. 30. 8, Gaut. II. 16, Manava gr. I. 2. %), in a lonely place ( San. gr. II 9. 1 &lsquo;araṇye&rsquo;) or on a river or other sacred spot (Baud. gr. II. 4. 1). But this does not apply to the agnihotrin, 748 who has to perform vedio rites and repeat homa</p>

Vasiṣtha quoted by Aparārka says that samdhyā performed in a cowpen or on a river or near the shrine of Viṣṇu ( or other deity ) respectively is ten times, 100000 of times or numberless times better than sandhyāvandana in the house. *** All presoribe that the morning samdhya is to be performed standing and the evening one in a sitting posture ( Āśv. gļ, III. 7. 6, Śān. gr.

<p>The principal constituents of samdhyopasana are these : ācamanas (sipping of water ), prāṇāyāma, mārjana thrice ( sprinkling himself with water to the accompaniment of several mantras ), aghamarṣana, offering of water to the sun (arghya ), japa of Gayatrl, and upasthāns ( reciting mantras by way of worship of the sun in the morning and generally of Varuṇa in the evening). Among the earliest references to Samdhyopāsana is the one in the Tai. Ar. II. 2,749 where it is said that when brahmavādins facing the east throw up water consecrated by the Gayatri, the evil spirits that fight with the sun are sent tumbling into the country (called) Mandeha Aruṇa (of the evil spirits). This shows that in ancient times samdhyā consisted principally of offering water (arghya ) to the sun in worship and japa of Gayatri. Aśv. gr. III.7.3-6, San. gr.

<p>Samdhyopāsana. Manava gr. (L. 2.1-5) refers only to the arghya offering to the sun and japa of Gāyatrl. It is in the Baud. Dh. S. II. 4 that we find an elaboration of samdhyopasana into various components such as acamana, mārjana, japa of Gayatri and upasthāna ( worship) of Mitra and Varuna ( respectively in the morning and evening with only two verses in each case ). *48 Modern writers went on adding details 0. g. it is now the practice in the Deccan to repeat the 24 names of Viṣnu at the very beginning of the samdbyopāsana, but this is hardly any where prescribed by any smrti or early commentator. Similarly elaborate rules are laid down about mystic nyāsas with the sixteen verses of the Puruṣasukta ( vide Apararka p. 140 ), of the nyāsa of the Nārāyapamantra of 25 letters on 25 parts of the body (Vṛddha-Hārita VI. 16-19 ) and of the letters of the Gāyatri</p>
<p>Brhatparāśara chap. V. p. 83). In modern times ācamana ia performed with the three names of Viṣnu, viz. Kośava, Narayana and Madhava in the form om Kesavāya namaḥ.&rsquo; The 24 names are given below.7488</p>

(I. 5. 10) prescribes that one should not perform ācamana with water that is in a cleft of the earth. Ap. Dh. S. (1. 5. 15. 5) says the same thing.749 One should perform</p>

<p>acamana in a sitting posture ( and not standing nor bent) in a pure spot, facing the north or east, one should sip water thriloo with water that is not hot and that is free from foam or bubbles, one should after sipping water wipe the lips twice (thrice according to Āp.)and should touch with the wet right hand one&rsquo;s eyes, ears, nose, heart and head. The water for doamana should be as much as would penetrate (or reach) to the heart in the case of brahmaṇas, to the throat in the case of ksatriyas, to the palate in the case of vaisyas; women and sūdras should sip on occasions of donmana only once as much water as would reach the palate, Manu (II. 18) and Yāj. (I. 18) say that water should be sipped by the brāhmatirtha (i. e, from the root of the thumb).950 The further elaborate rules laid down in such smstis as Gobhila gr. (L 2.5-6), Saṅkhasmrti 10 are not set out here. The occasions for acamana are many. According to Gobbila &quot; gr. I. 1.2 one must do every gṛbys rite with yajñopevita worn in the usual way and after doamana. Haradatta on Ap. Dh. S. I. 5. 15. 1 says that acamana is a subsidiary matter in all religious acts. There are several occasions when the sipping of water twice is necessary, the principal being before and after bhojana ( meals ); vide Gautama I, 40, Vas. 3. 38, Yaj. I. 196, Sm. O. I. p. 100, Madanapārijāta p. 57, Par. M. I. part 1. pp. 241-243. Both the Bṛ. Up. (VI. 1. 14 ) and Chan. Up. V. 2. 2 refer to the praotice of sipping water before and after bhojana and the Vedantasūtra III. 3. 18 is based on these upaniṣad passages and says that water is looked upon as the garment of prāṇa. 758 Numerous occasions when acamana is necessary are stated in Ap. Dh. S. I. 5. 16. 15-16, Manu V. 138 and 145, Yaj. I. 196, Kūrmapurāṇa I. 2. 13. 1-8 &amp;c.</p>

<p>Sarndhyā and prāmāyāma</p>
<p>317</p>
<p>Prānāyāma (restraint of breath ) is defined by the Yoga sūtra *** (IL 49 ) as the regulation of inhalation and exhalation of air. Gaut. I. 50 prescribes three prāṇāyāmas, each of which lasts for 15 matras (moras). Baud. Dh. S. IV. 1. 30 ( = Vas. Dh. 8. 25. 13=Saṅkhasmrti VII. 14 ) and Yaj. I. 23 say that the Siras of Gāyatri, the three vyābftis each preceded by &lsquo;om&rsquo; and the Gayatri verse are to be rehearsed mentally during the time of prāṇāyāma. According to Yoga-yājñavalkya, one should first revolve in the mind the seven vyabftis, each preceded by &lsquo;om,&rsquo; then the Gayatri and then the diras of Gāyatri, 754 Prānāyima has three components, pūraka ( inhaling the outside air ), kumbhaka ( keeping in the inhaled air i. e, neither taking in air nor giving it out) and reoaka (exhaling air from the lungs ). Manu VI. 70-71 highly praises the utility of prāṇāyāma in purifying the mind of sin.</p>
<p>Mārjana is performed by means of kusa grass dipped in water kept in a vessel of copper or udumbara wood or earthen. ware and while doing so one is to repeat om,' the vyābrtis, Gayatri and the three verses &lsquo;apo hi ṣthā&rsquo; (Rg. X, 9.1-3). Baud. Dh. S. II. 4. 2 adds more Vedio mantras for mārjana. *55 Mānava gr. I. 1.24, Yāj. I. 2% and others prescribe mārjana only with the three verses apo bi ṣtha'(Rg. X, 9, 1-3).</p>
<p>Aghamarṣana (driving out sin) consists in taking water in the right hand formed in the shape of a cow&rsquo;s ear, holding it noar one&rsquo;s nose, breathing out from the nose on the water (with the idea of driving away sin from oneself) to the accom paniment of the three verses' ftam ca' (Rg. X. 190.1-3) and then casting the water away to one&rsquo;s left on the ground.</p>

<p>Arghya 756 ( offering water out of respeot to the sun ) conaists in taking water in one&rsquo;s joined hands, repeating the Gayatri verse over it and standing faoing the sun and casting it up thrice. If a man cannot have water ( being at the time of Samdhyā on a road or in jail &amp;o.) he could use dust for water. The Tai. Ār. II. % says that a brāhmana contemplating the rising and setting sun and doing obeisance to it by going from left to right attains all bliss, since this Aditya is Brahma,</p>
<p>As to japa of Gayatri, vide above under Savitryupadega (p. 304). There is an extensive literature about the greatness of the japa of Gāyatri and of other holy vedic mantras which are passed over bere and for which reference may be made to A parārka pp. 46–48, Sm, C. I. pp. 143&ndash;15%, Gr. R. pp. 241-250, Ahnikaprakāśa pp. 311-316. A few details will be given under āhnika,</p>
<p>Astoupasthāna vide above(p.315, note 748). According to Baud. the worship 787 of the sun is done with the verses&rsquo;udvayam' (Rg. I. 50.10), &lsquo;Udu tyam&rsquo; (Rg. I. 50.1),&lsquo;citram&rsquo;(Rg. I. 115.1), &lsquo;tao-cakṣur&rsquo; (Rg. VIL 66. 16), &lsquo;ya udagat&rsquo; (Tai. Ār. IV. 42, 5). Manu II. 103 presoribes that he who does not perform the Sardhyopāsana in the morning and evening should be excluded from all actions meant for the benefit or honour of dvijas. Gobhila 788 smști II. 1 says the same and adds that brāhmanya resides in the three sathdhyās and that he who has no concern for samdhyopasana is not a brāhmaṇa, Baud. Dh. 8. II. 4. 20 calls upon the religious king to make brābmapas, who do not engage in samdhyopasana thrice a day, perform the work peculiar to sadras. The Kūrma-purāṇa ** goes so far as to say that even if a person engages in other actions which are religious but gives up the performance of samdhyopāsana, in so doing he falls into numerous hells.

<p>Sandhya</p>

<p>morning samdhyā and the sins committed in the day are removed by the evening sandhyā. Baud. Dh. 8. II. 4. 25-28, Yaj. III, 307 are to the same effect. When a person is impure owing to mourning or birth in the family, he is to perform sandhyd only up to arghya to the sun but not japa nor upasthāna.</p>
<p>In modern times the samdhyopasana has become a lengthy business by the addition of materials from purāṇas and the tantras. But as observed by the Samskararatnamālā rituals like nyāsa are non-Vedio 760 and many do not perform them. For various nyāsas and mudrās (postures of the fingers, hands eto.) one may consult the Smṛti-muktāphala ( āhnika pp. 328-333 ), Sm, C. I. pp. 146–148.761</p>
<p>Nyāsa means &lsquo;mentally invoking god and holy texts to come to ocoupy certain parts of the body to render it a pure and fit receptacle for worship and contemplation. The sixteen verses of the Purusasūkta (Rg. X. 90) are respectively invoked to reside in the left and right hands, the left foot, the right foot, the left and right knees, the left and right sides, the navel, the heart, the throat, the left and right arms, the mouth, the eyes and the head ( vide Apararka p. 140 ). The Bhagavata (VI. 8. 4-5) recommends that one should perform nyāsa on the hands and limbs of one&rsquo;s own body with the two mantras of Narayana and thus make Nārāyaṇa one&rsquo;s armour when some danger arises and that one should perform nyāsa with &lsquo;om&rsquo; and other syllables on one&rsquo;s feet, knees, thighs, belly, heart, chest, mouth and head.708 The Sm.

<p>body. Vśddha-Hārita VI. 16-19 speaks of the nyāge of the twenty-five letters of the mantra about Nārdyana on the twenty-five parts of the body. The Nityaofrapaddhati (pp. 578-579 ) describes the nyāga of the letters of the alphabet (51 in all ) from &lsquo;Om Keśavāya namaḥ&rsquo; to &lsquo;kṣam Nṛsimbaya namaḥ.&rsquo; One well-known mode is to assign Govinda, Mabidhara, Hṇśikeśa, Trivikrama, Viṣnu, Madhava respectively on the tips of the thumb, the index finger, the middle finger, the ring finger, the small finger and the middle of the palm, Manu II. 60 enjoining the touching of the limbs and head with water appears to contain the germ of this practice of nyāsa.</p>
<p>The Sm. O. I. (pp. 146–148 ) quotes long passages about the mudrūs (hand poses) to be made in the samdhyā adoration. The Samgraha 768 quoted in the Pūjāprakāśa (p. 123 ) states that the mudrās are to be made in worship, at the time of japa, dhyāna (contemplation) and when starting on kāmya rites ( performed for securing some desired object) and that they tend to bring the deity worshipped near to the worshipper. The names and number of mudrās differ considerably. For example, the Sm. O. and Smr. Mu. (abnika pp. 331-332 ) quote passages defining the following mudrās viz. sammukha, sampuṭa, vitata, vistirna, dvimukha, trimukha, adhomukba, vyāpakāñjalika, yamapasa, grathita, sammukhonmukha, vilamba, muștika, mina, kūrma, varāha, simbākrānta, mahākrānta, mudgara and pallava, The Nityācārapaddhati p. 533 derives the word mudrā from &lsquo;mud&rsquo; (joy) and the root &lsquo;rā&rsquo; (to give ) or &lsquo;drāvay&rsquo; (causal of dru, to put to flight) and says that &ldquo;nudra&rdquo; is 80 called because it gives delight to the gods and also puts to flight asuras (evil beings). That work and the Pūjā-prakasa (pp. 123-126 ) give the names of mudrās. They are dvahani, sthāpini, samnidhāpani, samrodhini, prasādamudrā, avagun. thana-mudrā, sammukba, prarthana, sankha, cakra, gadā, abja, (or padma), musala, khadga, dhanus, bāpa, nāraca, kumbba, vighna (for Vighneśvara ), saura, pustaka, lakṣml, saptajihva ( for Agni Vaiśvānara ), durgā, namaskara (bringing together both hands from the wrist to the tips of the fingers ), añjali, samhara (in all 32). The Nitydoārapaddhati (p. 536 ) says that sankha, cakra, gada, padma, musala, khadga, srivatsa and kaustubha are the eight mudrās of Viṣṇu. The Sm. C. quotes a</p>

<p>work oalled 764 Mahasamhita that the mudrās are not to be performed in the presence of a crowd and if so performed the deities become angry and the mudrās become fruitless. The Sāradatilaka (23. 106 ) states that all deities are gladdened by the mudrās and in verses 107-114 describes the following mudrās, viz. dvahani, stbāpani, samnidhāpani, saṁrodbini, sammukha, Bakala, avagunthana, dhenu, mabāmudra. The Acara-dinakara of Vardhamana-sūri composed in samvat 1468 ( 1411-12 A. D.) for Jainas enumerates 42 mudrās and defines them ( 1923, part II. pp. 385-386 ).</p>
<p>The influence of these mudrās spread outside India and they are still practised in the island of Bali. Miss Tyra de Kleen has brought out a very interesting book on the &lsquo;mudrās (the hand poses ) practised by Buddhist and Saiva priests&rsquo; (called pedandas ) in Bali, with 60 full page drawings (1924, New York ).</p>
<p>Study af the Veda :&ndash;A detailed examination of the educa tional system from anoient times onwards, together with its methods, courses of study and kindred topics will require a volume by itself. The works 765 mentioned in the note below may be read for that purpose. Here a few salient features alono can be set out.</p>
<p>The pivot of the whole educational system of ancient India was the teacher (variously called acārya, guru, u pādhyāya). The instruction was oral. Rg. VII. 103.5 ( speaking of frogs ) says</p>
<p>when one of these frogs follows another in making noise just as a learner repeats the words of the teacher'. Vide the quotations from the Atharvaveda and the Sat. Br. cited above (f. n. 622 and 625 ). In the beginning the father alone may have taught his son. The story narrated in the Br. Up. V. 2. 1 and the story of Svetaketu Aruṇeya who was taught by his father everything he knew (Br. Up. VI. 2. 1 and 4 ) illustrate this (vide f. n. 633 ).

<p>of sending 786 boys to learn from an acārya had become usual. The Chan. Up. itself says in one passage (VI. 1) that Svetaketus Āruñeya was placed by his father for twelve years as a student with a teacher. The saine upaniṣad (III. 11. 5 ) says that the father should impart the &lsquo;madhuvidya&rsquo; to his eldest son or to a wortby pupil only. As the boy stayed with the teacher in the latter&rsquo;s house and all instruction was oral, the teacher&rsquo;s position assumed the greatest importance. Satyakama Jābāla 767 says to his teacher (in Chan. IV. 9.3) &lsquo;I have heard from persons like your revered self that knowledge when learnt from an acārya reaches the highest excellence. The Svetāśva. taropaniṣad 768 ( VI. 23 ) places the guru almost on a level with God and inculcates the highest devotion to him. The Ap. Dh. S. I. 2. 6. 13 says the pupil should wait upon the acārya as if he were &ldquo;9 God.&rsquo; The story of Ekalavya, whom Droṇa refused to take as &amp; pupil because he was a niṣāda and who by worshipping the image of Dropa is alleged to have become an adept in archery, illustrates two points viz. the prevailing notion of the greatness of a guru and the necessity of single minded devotion to him for attaining proficienoy (vide Adiparva 132 for the story and also Droṇaparva 181. 17). The Mahābhārata condemns him who learns the Vedas at home and says that Raibhya became superior to Yavakrita 770 because the former learnt from a guru, while the other did not do 8o.

<p>greatness of the ādārya. Manu II. 146 ( = Viṣṇu Dh. 8. 30. 44 ) says that both the father (jangka ) and the teacher are oalled father (pilā ) but the father (i, e. ācārya) who imparts the sacred Veda is superior to the father that gives (physical) birth, since the birth in spiritual learning is for a brāhmaṇa of eternal benefit here and hereafter. But in II. 145 Manu 771 says that an ācārya is ten times superior to an upādhyāya, the father is superior to a hundred ācāryas, while the mother is thousand-fold superior to the father. Gaut. II. 56 declares that the ācārya is the highest among all gurus while according to some the mother js the highest. Yāj. I. 35 also places the mother higher than the ācārya. Gaut. I. 10-11, Vas. Dh. S. III. 21, Manu II. 140, Yaj. I. 34 define 778 the ācārya as one who performs the upana yana of the student and im parts the whole Veda to him. The Nirukta 773 ( I. 4) derives acārya as follows: &lsquo;he makes the student understand the proper course of conduct, or he collects wealth (i. e. fee) from the student (or gathers together the meanings of words ), or he increases the intelligence ( of the student)&rsquo;. Āp. Dh. S. I. 1.1. 14 says &lsquo;The ācārya is so called since the student gathers his duties from him.&rsquo; Manu II. 69 says that the teacher, after performing upa nayana, teaches his pupil the rules about sauca (bodily purity), ācāra (rules of conduct in every day life), the offering (of fuel-stick) in fire and sandhya adoration. Yāj. I. 15 is to the same effect. Though the words ācārya, guru 774 and upādhyāya are very often used as synonyms, anoient writers made a distinction between them. According to Manu II. 141 and 14%, an upadhyāya is one who teaches to a student &amp; por tion of the Veda or the Vedāngas 775 (subsidiary lores of the</p>

<p>Veda ) as a means of his own livelihood and a guru is one who performs the samgkāras and who maintains the child. This latter definition shows that guru means the father here. Vas. Dh. 8. (III. 22-23), Viṣnu Dh. S. 29. 2, and Yāj. I. 35 define upādhyāya in the same way as Manu. Acoording to Yāj. I. 34 the guru is one who performs the samskāras and imparts the Voda. This corroborates the statement made above that originally the father himself taught the Veda to his son. The word guru is often used in the sense of any elderly person, male or female, who is entitled to respect. Viṣnu Dh.776 . ( 32.1-2 ) asys that the father, the mother and the acārga are the three highest gurus of a person and Manu II. 227-237 contain the most sublime glorification of these three, Davala 777 says that among gurus five deserve special honour, viz. father, mother, acarya, eldest brother and husband ( in the case of women)&rsquo;. Manu (II. 149 ) says that whoever confers on another the benefit of knowledge, whether great or small, is the latter&rsquo;s guru.</p>
<p>A great deal is said about the qualifications of the ācārya who is to perform the upanayana of a person and to teach him the Veda. Ap. Dh. S. 778 I. 1. 1. 11 refers to a Brahmana text to the effect &ldquo;he whom a teacher devoid of learning initiates enters from darkness into darkness and be also (i. e. an acārya ) who is himself unlearned ( enters into darkness ).' Āp. Dh. S, (1. 1. 1. 12-13 ) further provides that one should desire a performer of one&rsquo;s upanayana who is endowed with learning and whose family is hereditarily learned and who is serene in mind and that one should study Vedio lore under him up to the end (of brahmacarya ) as long as the teacher doos not fall off from the path of dharma. Vyāss ( quoted in Sam, P. p. 408) says 779 that the dcārya should be a brahmapa who is solely</p>

<p>CH. VII) Upanayana and qualifications of the ācārya</p>
<p>325</p>
<p>devoted to the Voda, who knows dharma, is born of a good family, who is pure, is a śrotriya that has studied his Vedic sākha and who is not lazy. Śrotriya has been defined above (f. n. 290 ). Ap. Dh. S. II. 3. 6. 4 and Baud, gr. I. 7.3 define a śrotriya as one who has studied one śālchā of &amp; Veda. Vide Vāyupurias vol, T. 59, 29 also.780 The āoārya in upanayang must be a brāhmaṇa; as to the study of veda one should ordinarily learn the Veda from &amp; brāhmaṇa teacher; in times of difficulty (i, e, when a brāhmana is not available ) one may learn the Veda from a ksatriya or vaibya teacher; but in such circumstances the only service that &amp; brābmaṇa student rendered to the guru would be following after the non-brāhmaṇa teacher; ho had not to render bodily service (such as shampooing or washing the feet &amp;o). Vide Ap. Dh.S.II. 2, 4, 25-28 (quoted above in note 2:9), Gaut. 7,1-3, Baud, Dh. S. 1.2.40-42, Manu II. 241. Manu II. 238 allows even a brālmaṇa to learn subhā vidyā ( visibly beneficial knowledge ) even from a sūdra, Santiparva 165, 31 does the same.781 The Mit. on Yāj. I. 118 remarks that a kṣatriya or vaisya should teach &amp; brahmana only when urged by him and not at his sweet will. Aparārka (p. 160 ) says that Manu II. 241 allows only teaching to a kṣatriya, but does not allow him to make it a means of his livelihood.784</p>
<p>We saw above (p.321) that the instruction was entirely oral. The first thing that was taught to the boy was the pranava and the vyābṛtis and the Gāyatri. Then the boy was to be taught other parts of the Veda. It is desirable to get out briefly the method of teaching the Veda followed in ancient times. The Sān. gr. (IV. 8) describes the method as follows: the teacher sits facing the east or north, while the other (i, e, the student) sits to his right facing the north or two students may sit in that way; but if there are more than two they should sit as the available space will allow.788 The student should not sit on a high soat</p>

<p>before the teacher nor on the same seat with him; he should not stretoh out his feet, nor should he sit seizing his knees with his arm, nor should he lean against &amp; support, nor should he place his feet on his lap nor should he hold his feet like an axe. After the student utters &ldquo;Recite, Sir,&rdquo; 784 the teacher should urge him to pronounce &lsquo;om&rsquo;; the other (i. e. the student) should reply &lsquo;om&rsquo;. Thereafter he (the student) should recite continuously. After reciting he should clasp the teacher&rsquo;s feet and say &lsquo;we have finished, Sir&rsquo; and go away to his business. Some teachers say that the teacher should say &lsquo;Leave, let us stop&rsquo;. In the Rk Prātisakhya, 785 15th patala, there is a description of the method of teaching the Veda, which closely agrees with the above quotation from the San. gr. It adds that the teacher may also sit facing the north-east. When the teacher recites two words or more, the first pupil ( to the right of the teacher) repeats the first of the two or more words and the other pupils ropeat the rest afterwards. The teacher recites one word if it is a compound, two words if they are un-compounded; the teacher also clearly explains how to recite the words if there is any difficulty ; in this way the whole praśna is finished and all the pupils repeat again the whole of it. A praśna generally has three mantras and each adhydya has about sixty praśnas. Manu ( II. 70-74 ) also prescribes certain rules: the student should sip water (ācamana ) when about to begin Vedio study, should face the north, should fold both hands 786 together (and place them on his knee ), should wear light (pure) olothes, should at the beginning and end of Vedic study clasp the feet of the teacher with crossed hands</p>

<p>The study of the Veda was the first duty of every twice born person (dvijāti). Vedic Literature had grown to vast proportions even in the times of the Tai. Br. ( III. 10.11 ), as the story of Indra and Bharadvāja cited above (p. 271 ) shows. The ideal was set up by Manu II. 165, viz. that the whole Veda together with seoret doctrines ( Upaniṣads ) was to be learnt by every dvijāti. The Sat. Br. XI. 5. 7 oontains a eulogy of Veda study (svādbyāya) and the injunction &lsquo;svādhyāyosdbyetavyaḥ&rsquo; (one must study the Veda ) occurs there very frequently. The Ap. Dh, S. (1. 4. 12. 1 and 3) quotes787 the Tai. A. II. 14. 3 that the study of the Veda (svadhyāya ) is austerities and also the Sat. Br. XI. 5. 6. 8. The Mahabhāśya (vol. I. p. 1) quotos &amp; Vedio text&rsquo;a brāhmans should study and understand without any purpose ( or desire of reward) dharma and the Veda with its six angas.788 The Mahabharata says that a brāhmaps may be deemed to have completely accomplished his duty by the study of the Veda.789 Yāj. I. 40 says that it is Veda alone that confers the highest bliss upon dvijātis by enabling them to understand and perform sacrifices, austerities and auspicious sots (like samskāras ). The Mahābhāṣya (vol. I. p. 9) contains the traditional extent of the four Vedas, viz. that there were 101 sākhāg of the Yajurveda, 1000 of the Sāmaveda, 21 of the Rgvoda and nine of the Atharvaveda.790 Concessions had to be</p>

<p>made to the shortness of human life and the weakness of the human mind. Therefore Gaut. II. 51, Vas. Dh. S. VII. 3, Manu III. %, Yaj. I. 52 and others allowed &amp; person to study only one Veda. After a man studied his own Veda, he could if so minded study another sākhā of another Veda or other Vedas. The rule laid down by many emptis is that one should study the sakhā of the Veda which his ancestors studied and should parform religious rites with mantras derived from that sākha. Vide Medhatithi on Manu III. 2 and Visvarūpa on Yaj. I. 51.791 That person who does not study &amp; Vedio Sākhā studied by his ancestors and studies another sākhā altogether was called * sakhārapda'. Whatever religious rites a man did with the procedure and inantras of another sākhā giving up his own sakha becomes fruitless. But an exception was made to the effect that if some 792 religious rite was omitted in one&rsquo;s sākhā, but was dealt with in another sākhā and was not opposed to the teaching of one&rsquo;s sākhā, it may be performed as in the case of Agnihotra ( which is not dealt with in all sākhās, but is to be performed by all ).</p>
<p>Teachers mostly confined themselves to one place. But we find that even in ancient times there were teachers who wandered from one country to another. In the Kauṣ. Br. Up. IV, 1 we find that the famous Bālāki Gārgya moved about in the countries of Usinara, Matsya, Kuru-Pancāla and Kāśivi deba. In the Bs. Up. III. 3. 1 Bhujyu Lāhyāyani tells Yajnavalkya that he and others wandered about in the country of Madra for study. Students generally stuck to one teacher ; but it appears that they sometimes flocked to renowned teachers as waters flow down a slope 793 (Tai, Up. I. 4. 3). There were also students who wandered from teacher to teacher and were</p>

<p>therefore derisively called &lsquo;tirthakaka ( crows at a saored place ),&rsquo; as the Mahabhaṣya states.784</p>
<p>As the study of the Veda was &amp; duty enjoined upon a brahmana, so teaching Veda to another was a duty. Medhatithi on Manu (II. 113 ) quotes &amp; Vedio text 7** &lsquo;He who having studied the Veda would not teach one who requests him to do so would be one who destroys his own good aots (i.e. would lose the benefit thereof), would shut the door leading to happiness; therefore he should teach; it leads to great glory&rsquo;. When Satyakāma Jābāla did not teach his pupil Upakosala anything for twelve years, though the latter served asaiduously by attending to the sacred fires of the teacher, the teacher&rsquo;s wife remonstrated with the busband by saying this student bas worked hard and attended the fires, may the fires not congure you and order you to teach him the vidyā he desires' (Cbān, Up. IV. 10. 1-2). The Praśna Up. 798 VI, 1 gives expression to the view that if a teacher keeps back anything he knows he dries up entirely. The Āp. Dh. S. I. 4. 14. 2-3 expressly prescribes the teacher whom a student asks for instruction should not refuse him, if he finds no defect in the student.' 787 Ap. Dh, s. (I. 2. 8. 25-28 ) lays down certain excellent rules for the teacher &ldquo;the teacher, anxious for the welfare of the student as if he were his son, should atten tively impart learning to the student without hiding anything from him in all matters of duty; nor should the teacher restrain the student for his own work in such a way as to cause obstacles in his study except in seasons of distress. A teacher becomes no teacher if he avoids giving instruction' (1. e, he may be abandoned ). The Dronaparva (50.21 ) says that a pupil oomes only after the son socording to the idea of those</p>

<p>who know dharma. If a teacher does not teach &amp; pupil any thing even after his pupil has stayed with him for a year, the former receives all the sins of the pupil. A teacher 798 who did not teach or was sinful was to be abandoned. Similarly &amp; teacher, who becamo puffed up, did not care for what should or should not be done and took to &amp; sinful path was to be abandoned.*9 Ap. I. 1. 1. 13 lays down that a student must stay with his teacher who performs his upanayana till he completes his study, unless the teacher himself swerved from the path of dharma and became a sinner and (I. %. 7. 26 ) that if the teacher cannot teach the subject, the pupil may resort to another teacher.</p>
<p>The smrtis lay down rules about the qualifications of a student who deserves to be taught. In the Vidyāsūkta quoted in the Nirukta 80(II. 4) we see that the teacher was not to impart vidya (knowledge) to one who was jealous (or who treated vidya with contempt), was crooked and was not self-restrained and that learning was to be imparted to one who was pure, attentive, intelligent and endowed with brahmacarya ( celibacy ), who would never prove false ( to his teacher) and who would guard what he learnt as a treasure. Manu (II. 109 and 112 also ) says that ten persons deserve to be taught viz. the son of the teacher, a student who serves his guru, one who gives some knowledge in exchange, one who knows dharma or who is pure (in body and mind), who is truthful, who is able to study and retain it, who gives money (for teaching ), who is well-disposed and who is one&rsquo;s near relative (agnate). Yāj. 1. 28 mentions all these and adds that the student must be grateful, not inolined to hate or prove false to the teacher, healthy and not disposed to find fault. The student should always be dependent</p>

<p>on and under the control of the teacher (as Āp. Dh. 8.801 I. 1.2. 19 and Narada say) and should stay with no one but the teacher. We saw above (p. 274) that from ancient times the student had to serve the teacher by tending his cattle ( Chandogya IV. 4. 5), had to beg for food and announce it to the teacher ( ibid. IV, 3.5) and to look after his sacred fires and to learn the Veda only in the time that would be left after doing work for the gurusos, Besides these, the rules concerning his conduct towards the teacher, the teacher&rsquo;s wife and son, concerning the method of salutation and showing respect, the food, drinks, and actions allowed or prohibited to students are too numerous to be set out in detail. A few important ones from Gautama, Ap. Dh. S., Manu II and Yāj. I. 33 are stated below. Gaut. (II. 13, 14, 18, 19, 22, 23, 25) says that the student should speak the truth, bathe everyday, should not look at the sun; should avoid honey, flesh, perfumes, the wearing of flowers, sleeping by day, rubbing oil on the body, putting collyrium in the eyes, going in &amp; cart, 803 wearing shoes and holding an umbrella, love affairs, anger, covetousness, infatuation, vain discussions, playing on musical instruments, luxurious baths with hot water, metioulous cleans ing of the teeth, eostatic states of inind, dancing, singing, calumny of others, dangerous places, gazing at women or touching young women, gambling, serving a low person (or doing very low work ), injury to animals, obscene or barsh talk, wine. Manu (II. 198 and 180-181) prescribes that he should not sleep on a cot and should observe complete celibacy, but if he suffers from night emissions he should bathe, worship the sun and repeat thrice the mantra &lsquo;punar mām&rsquo; (Tai. Ar. I. 30). The Ap. Dh. 8. (I. 1. 2. 21-30, L. 1. 3. 11-24) contains similar rules of conduct. Ap. says (I. 1. 2. 28-30 ) that the student should not wash his limbs with hot water ( generally ), but he may do so if they are smeared with dirty and impure matter provided he does it out of the sight of the teacher and that he should not bathe in water in a sportive manner, but</p>

<p>Gautama and Baud. Dh, S. (1. 2. 34 and 37) say that the student is to serve his teacher by following after him when he goes anywhere, he should help the teacher in his toilet and bath and should shampoo his body and take food left by him (ucchiṣta ); 505 lio should be diligent in doing work that would be pleasing and beneficial to the teacher; he was to study when the toacher called him, he was not to cover his throat with a piece of cloth, or was not to sit in the presence of his teacher with his feet on his lap, was not to stretch his feet, he was not to clear loudly his tbroat, nor to laugh, yawn or crack the knuckles; he was when called by the teacher to reply at once leaving his sest or bed and was to approach the teacher even when he called from a distance ; he should always occupy a Beat lower than that of his teacher and should go to sleep after his teacher and rise before him (Gautama II. 20-21, 30-32 ). Manu II. 194-198 and Ap. Dh. S. I. 2. 5. 26 and I. 2.6. 1-12 contain similar rules. Manu (11. 199) says that a pupil should</p>

<p>The word &ldquo;ucchista&rsquo; is used, as exbaustively pointed out by Medhatithi on Manu VI. 80, in several song08. It literally means &lsquo;what is left out.&rsquo; The most usual senses are three, viz. (1) food left in tbe plate from which one has enten, (2) food taken out in a vessel for sery ing to a person but not exhausted by being served in his plate, and (as applied to a person), (3) one who bas not washed his hands and mouth after eating food (or as applied to a plato ) the plato (not yet cleaned) from which ono has taken his meal. Vide IV. 211 for the 2nd meaning. Another meaning is : (4) one who has answered a call of nature and not yet perforinod the &ldquo;purificatory acts like scamana is said to be ucchiṣta. Vide Manu IV, 142 ( for tbis and the 3rd moaning ) and V. 143 ( for 3). Sometimes the word is usod in its literal sense (vide Ap. Dh, 8. I, 1. 4. 2). Vide Manu V. 141 for anothor appli cntion of the word.</p>

<p>Rules of conduct for a student</p>
<p>333</p>
<p>not mimic the gait, the manner of speech and the actions of the teacher. Manu (II. 200-201 ) calls upon the pupil to close his ears (with his bands or fingers) or to leave the place wbere somebody indulges in calumnies about the teacher or points out the faults in him, and states that if the pupil himself finds fault with his teacher or caluinniates him, the pupil ( in the next life ) is born as an ass or a dog. Viṣnu Dh. 8.806 28. 26 says the same.</p>
<p>Some rules are laid down as to how the brahmacārin is to deal with the hair on his head. Even the Rg. speaks of boys with several sikbās (topknot). Vide note 598 above. Gaut. I. 26 and Manu II. 219 say that a brahmacārin may either shave his entire head, or may allow all the hair to grow as matted or should keep only a tult of hair on the head (and shave the rest ).807 Ap. Db. S. 1. 1. 2. 31-32, Vas. VII. 11 allow only two alternatives viz. growing all the hair or keeping a tuft of hair, while Viṣnu Dh. 8. 28. 41 says that a student may either shave the entire head or grow matted hair. One was not to untie one&rsquo;s sikha, while on the public road.808</p>
<p>One of the rules for the student was that he was not to pronounce the name of his teacher even when the teacher was not present without prefixing or affixing an honorifio addition ( such as srl, bhatta, Mcārya ). Gaut, ordains that the student should not speak of his teacher, the teacher&rsquo;s son or wife or of a man who has been initiated for a srauta sacrifice by their bare names80s and then says that when it is absolutely necessary</p>

<p>to refer to thege by name the student should not pronounce the name and gotra of his teacher as they are, but by means of a synonym (e. g. if the teacher&rsquo;s name is Haradatta or Deves. vara the pupil should respectively say Devarāta or Sureśvara ). Ap. Dh, 8. I. 2. 8. 15 says that even after returning home &amp; snataka should avoid touching his former teacher with his fingers ( to call his attention), frequent muttering of something in his care, laughing into his face, calling him out loudly, taking his name, ordering him about. Manu II. 128 and Gaut. VI. 19 say that a man who has been initiated for a srauta sacrifice should not be addressed by his name, even though he be younger than the person addressing, but that one should use the words ' bhoṛ' and &lsquo;bhavat&rsquo; when addressing him or speak ing about him and may refer to him by words like dikṣita &amp;c. There are other rules about addressing or referring by name which may be set out here for the sake of completeness. The Sm. O. (I. p. 45 ) and Haradatta on Gaut, II. 29 quote a smrtiklo that one should not mention by name only one&rsquo;s teacher, teacher&rsquo;s son and wife, &amp; dikṣit&amp;, any other guru, father, mother, paternal and maternal uncles, one&rsquo;s benefactor, a learned man, one&rsquo;s father-in-law, one&rsquo;s husband, one&rsquo;s mother&rsquo;s sister. The Mahabharata says that one should not mention by name or address as &lsquo;tvam&rsquo;(thou) one&rsquo;s elders, but one may speak of one&rsquo;s contemporaries or those who are younger by their names.811 Another vorse says that one should not mention one&rsquo;s own name, the name of one&rsquo;s guru, the name of a mean person, of one&rsquo;s wife and one&rsquo;s eldest child.</p>
<p>Upasangrahaṇa consists in repeating one&rsquo;s gotra and name, saying &lsquo;I salute&rsquo;, touching one&rsquo;s ears, olasping the feet ( as stated above) and bending one&rsquo;s head while so doing. In abhivādana there is no clasping of the feet with the hands; one</p>

<p>Rules about saluting ( abhivadana )</p>
<p>335</p>
<p>may or may not touch the feet of the person to be honoured.</p>
<p>Abhivādana must always be preceded by pratyutthāna.813</p>
<p>Very detailed rules were laid down about pratyutthāna (rising from one&rsquo;s seat to receive a person), abhivadana ( salut ing a man), u pasamgrabana (saluting by clasping the feet of the teacher or another with one&rsquo;s hands ), pratyabhivada (returning &amp; salutation), and namaskāra ( bowing with the word &lsquo;namah &lsquo;). According to Ap. Dh. 8. I.2.5.19 and I. 3. 10. 17 the student must, when he meets bis teacher after sunrise, clasp his teacher&rsquo;s feet and also before beginning the day&rsquo;s lesson of Vedio study and also after finishing it. Manu IL 71 says the same. Gaut. (I. 52-54) prescribes the clasping of the feet every day in the morning and at the beginning and at the end of a lesson in the Veda. Acoording to Ap. Dh. S. 1.2.5.20 on other oocasions whenever the student meets the teacher only abhivādana is sufficient, though according to some teachers (Ap. I. 2. 5. 21) clasping the teacher&rsquo;s feet is necessary on each oocasion. Ap. Dh. S. L. 2. 5. 22 states that in upasamgrabaṇa the teacher&rsquo;s right foot is to be stroked below and above with the student&rsquo;s right hand and the foot and ankle are both to be taken hold of, while according to some teachers, the student must press each foot of the teacher with both hands and clasp them. Manu II. 72, Viṣnu Dh.8.28.15, and Baud. Dh. 8. I. 2. 24 say that the student is to clasp the feet of the teacher with crossed hands, touobing the right foot with the right hand and the left foot with the left hand. Kullūka on Manu II. 72 quotes Paithinasi that the student should olasp the teacher&rsquo;s feet with his hands turned upwards. Baud. Dh. 8. I. 2. 28 adds that clasping should not be done when either the teacher or the pupil is seated, or is lying down or impure. Acc ording to Gaut. VI. 1-3 one must clasp every day on the first meeting and particularly on his or their return from a journey, the feet of one&rsquo;s parents, of the blood relations of parents (e. g. paternal and maternal uncles ), of the elder brother, of the guru (i. e, acārya, upadhyaya) and of persons Venerated by one&rsquo;s gurus, Ap.

<p>Abhivādana is of three kinds, viz, nitya (obligatory every day ), naimittika (to be done only on certain ocoasions) and kāmya (to be done only if a person has certain rewards in View). As examples of nitya abhivadana one may instance the rules of Ap. Dh. 8.813 ( 1. 2. 5. 12–13) &ldquo;every day a student should get up from bed in the last watch of the night and standing near his teacher salute him with the words &lsquo;I so and 80, ho&rsquo; (salute thee ); and the student should also salute other very aged (and learned brāhmaṇas) who may reside in the same village before his morning meal.&rdquo; Yaj. I. 26 also speaks of the latter. The occasional abbivā dana is done on certain oooasions such as return from a journey (Ap. Dh. S. 1. 2.5. 14). A person may salute elderly persons whenever be chooses, if he is desirous of long life or (bliss in) heaven (Ap. Dh. 8. 1. 2. 5. 15 and Baud. Dh. S. I. 2. 26). Manu 814 ( II. 120 and 121 ) gays * the prāṇas ( vital breaths) of a young man mount upwards when an old man approaches; but by rising to meet him and salutation ( to him ), be ( the young man) recovers them. He who habitually salutes and constantly pays reverence to the aged obtains an increase of four things viz. length of life, knowledge, fame and strength. Ap. Dh. S, I, 4, 14. 11,818 Baud. Dh. 8. L 2. 44, Manu II. 130 and Vas. Dh. S. 13. 41 prescribe that a person must honour by rising and mentioning one&rsquo;s name an officiating priest, one&rsquo;s father-in-law, paternal and maternal unoles, even though these may be younger than oneself in</p>

<p>Rules about abhivadana</p>
<p>337</p>
<p>years. Gaut. ( VI. 9 ) however says that in the case of these one need only rise from his seat to receive them; but it is not necessary to salute them (abhivadana is not necessary ). Viṣnu Dh. 8. 32. 4 expressly says that in the case of offioiating priests and others specified by Ap. and Gaut. and who are younger, rising from one&rsquo;s beat is tantamount to abhivadana. Manu II. 117 says that one must perform abhivadana to a person from whom one learns secular, Vedic or spiritual knowledge of any kind. There is some difference in the words used at the time of abhivadana. Usually the words are &lsquo;abhivadaye devadatte śarma-ham816 bhoh&rsquo; ( vide Ap. I. 2.5. 12, Gaut. VI, 5, Baud. Dh. S, I. %, 27, Vas. XIII. 44, Manu II. 122 and 124). But this mode is appropriate only if the person addressed knows how to return the salutation. Manu II. 123 and 126 and Vas. Dh. S. 13. 45 declare that in the case of those who do not know how to return a salutation (pratyabhivadana, and according to Manu in the case of women also ) one should omit the word &lsquo;bhoh and simply say &lsquo;abbivadaye aham&rsquo; (omitting one&rsquo;s name ). Ap. Dh. 8. I. 4. 14. 20 similarly says that in saluting women, &amp; kṣatriya or &amp; vaiśya one should use &amp; pronoun and omit one&rsquo;s name.817</p>
<p>The manner of abhivadana was as follows 3818 A brahmana shall salute stretching forward his right arm on a level with his ear, a ksatriya holding it on a level with the chest, a vaisya holding it on a level with the waist and a sūdra holding it low (up to his feet) and that the salutation shall be by joining one&rsquo;s hands&rsquo; (Ap. Dh. 8. I. 2. 5. 16-17). The Madanapārijata adds that abhivādana is with both handa when the person to be saluted is learned, but with one hand only if he is not learned (p. 27 ) and the Sm. O. (I. p. 36 ) quotes Viṣnu and Atri to the</p>

<p>same effeot. The stretohing of the hands up to the ear &amp;o. indicates how far the head is to be bent in each case.</p>
<p>There were also other rules about honouring one&rsquo;s elders in the presence of one&rsquo;s teacher or honouring the teacher&rsquo;s teacher or about one&rsquo;s behaviour when a gentleman comes to see one&rsquo;s doārya and leaves him, which are here passed over for want of space. Vide Āp. Dh. 8. 1. 2. 6. 29-32, Manu II. 205.</p>
<p>A brahmapa who does not know the form of returning &amp; Halutation must not be saluted by &amp; learned man; he is like &amp; sūdra (Manu II. 126). Similarly a brāhmaṇa was not to perform abhivādana to a ksatriya or a vaisya however learned the latter may be, but one should simply say &lsquo;svasti&rsquo;; those who are of the same oaste should do abhivādana. 819 The Mit. on Yāj. III. 292 and Aparārka p. 1188 quote sūtras of Hārita presoribing as prāyasoitta a fast of one, two or three days respectively for a brahmaṇa galuting a kṣatriya, vaisya or sūdra and also for saluting when the persons saluted or the man waluting are in such a condition as to make them unfit for abhivādana. One should not salute with the shoes on or when one&rsquo;s head is wrapped up or one&rsquo;s hands are full (Ap. Dk. S. I. 4. 14. 19); or if one carries a load of fuel-sticks or holds a pot of flowers or food in one&rsquo;s hands one shall not salute, nor shall one salute on oocasions similar to the preceding (such as one being engaged in worship of manes, of fire or other gods or when one&rsquo;s teacher is so engaged), nor should one salute a teacher standing Very close to him (Baud. Dh. 8. I. 2. 31-32). When one is impure or the person he meets is impure ( owing to aśauca or other causes ) no salutation is to be made or returned (Ap. Dh. 8. I. 4. 14. 17 ). Gaut. IX. 45 says that one should not occupy a seat or perform abhivādana and namaskāra with shoes on. One need not salute a person who is not a guru or who stands in a lower or higher place than oneself (Ap. Dh. S. I. 4. 14. 14). Ap. Dh. 8. I. 4. 14. 23, Manu II. 135 and Viṣnu Dh. 3. 32. 17 say that a brāhmaṇa ten years old is like a father to a ksatriya even 100 years old and so deserves salutation from the ksatriya.</p>

<p>Rules about abhivādana</p>
<p>339</p>
<p>Ap. Dh. 8. (I. 4. 14. 12 ) gives a special rule that a friendship kept for ten years as fellow citizens, a friendship contracted at school for five years, the fact of &amp; śrotriya being three years older entitles the friend or śrotriya to a salutation. But Gaut. (VI. 14-17) and Manu II. 134 give somewhat different rules viz. contemporaries who are born in the same year are to be addressed with the word &lsquo;bhoh&rsquo; or &lsquo;bhavat&rsquo; and &amp; fellow citizen who is ten years older than oneself and an artist who is five years older than oneself and a brotriya studying the same Vedio school as oneself who is three years older are to be addressed similarly. Manu adds blood relations to the list when the difference in age is very small. The Smartyarthasara p. 7 gives a long list of persons whom one should never salute viz. an heretio, &amp; person guilty of grave sins, an atheist, gamblers, thieves, ungrateful persons, drunkarde. Vide also Manu IV. 30 and Yaj. I. 130 (as to showing no respect even by words to heretios &amp;c).</p>
<p>In the case of certain persons one was to show honour only by rising from his seat and not by abhivādana. Gaut. (VI. 9) mentions some such persons who are already referred to in note 815. Headds that (VI.10-11) even a sūdra of eighty years or more must be honoured by rising by one (even though the latter be of a higher varpa ) young enough to be his son ( but there will be no abbivādana ) and that an arya (i, e, one belonging to the three higher oastes) must be honoured by rising by a gūdra even if the latter be older (and so a vaisya must honour a ksatriya though the latter be younger). Haradatta explains that the word kūdra in Gaut. VI. 10 is only illustrative and that an old vaibya must be honoured by a young ksatriya or brābmana by simply rising from his seat and an old kṣatriya by &amp; young brābmana in the same way. Ap. Dh. 8. (II. 2. 4. 16-18) lays down that if a brāhmaṇa who has not studied the Veda comes 88 a guest one may give him &amp; seat, water and food but one should not rise to receive him, but should rise to recoive him if he is entitled to abhivādana on account of age (as stated in Ap. I. 4. 14. 12, and Manu II. 134 ); similarly a brāhmaṇa need not rise to receive a ksatriya or vaibya ( except on the same ground of age).</p>
<p>The rules about returning a salutation (about pratyabhivada) are made somewhat intricate and obscure by the varying interpretations of commentators. Pratyabhivada consists in pronou noing a benediction in the proper form given by a gury</p>
<p>340</p>
<p>History of Dharmaśāstra</p>
<p>[ Ch. VII</p>
<p>or other person who has been saluted. Among the oldest880 is the rule in Āp. Dh. 8. 1. 2. 5. 18 &lsquo;when returning the salute of one belonging to the first three castes, the (last syllable of the ) name ( of the person whose salutation is to be returned ) shall be lengthened to three moras&rsquo;. Vasistha&rsquo;s rule (XIII. 46 ) is&rsquo; when the salute is returned, the last vowel ( of the noun standing) in the vocative is protracted to the length of three moras and if it is a diphthong (i. e. e or o but not of the dual number ) it becomes &lsquo;ay&rsquo; or &lsquo;v&rsquo;.g. &lsquo;bho becomes bhāv&rsquo;. Manu II. 123 prescribes &ldquo;a brāhmana should be thus saluted in return,&lsquo;mayst thou be long-lived, O gentle onel&rsquo; and the vowel *a&rsquo; or any other vowel at the end of the name (of the person addressed ) should be made plula (i.e. lengthened to three moras) and if the name ends in a consonant, the preceding vowel</p>
<p>is made pluta.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That these rules are very ancient follows from Panini&rsquo;s sūtra (VIII. %. 83 ) when the salutation of a person who is not a sūdra is returned by the person saluted, the final vowel in the name ( that occurs at the end of the sentence of pratyabhivāda ) becomes pluta. The Mabābhāṣya comments on this and two vārtikas thereon say that this rule does not apply when it is a woman to whom the salutation is returned and it applies optionally when the person whos a salutation is returned is a kṣatriya or vaisya. All these rules are exemplified in the foot-note below.821 Ap. Dh. S. agrees with this rule of the ancient grammarians. The verge of Manu (II. 125 ) also really means the same thing; but there the word &lsquo;akāra&rsquo; is only</p>

<p>illustrative and stands for all vowels. The ancient oom mentator Medhātithi interprets Manu so as to agree with Pāṇini and says &lsquo;in the realm of the use of words and their senses Panini has higher authority than Manu, that the pratyabhivāda words containing the benediction about long life are not stereotyped, that when a kṣatriya returns the salutation of a kṣatriya or a vaisya of a vaisya, the same rules hold good&rsquo;. As a person of a higher varna was not to do abhivadana to one of lower varṇa (vide note 819 above ) there would be no occasion for pratyabhivada from the side of the latter. The verse of Manu is interpreted by Haradatta and a few others in a different manner. According to them the last vowel in the name of the person whose salutation is to be returned is pluta and then a' is added to it, and that if the vocative ends in e or o, it beoomes aya or āva ( with a&rsquo;added ).823 This view is opposed to Panini, the Mahābhāṣya, the Kāśika, Apastamba and several writers of digests. Aparārka and the Sm. C. condemn the interpretation put upon Manu&rsquo;s vorse by commentators like Haradatta.8%</p>
<p>What great importance was attached to the correct utter ance of the return salutation can be seen from the fact tbat one of the miscellaneous reasons assigned for the necessity of grammatical studies in the Mahābhāṣya is that (as stated in a verse) a person who returns from a journey will perform salutation to ignorant persons ( who do not know how to utter pratyabhivada) as if to women with the words &lsquo;abhivadaye</p>

<p>Ap. Dh, S. (I, 2.7.27) prescribes that the student shall be have towards his teacher&rsquo;s wife as towards the teacher himself, but he shall not clasp her feet or eat the residue of her food.888 Gaut. (II. 31-32 ) also says the same thing and adds that the student shall not assist the wives of the teacher at their toilet or bath nor wash their feet nor shampoo them. Manu II. 211, Baud. Dh. S. I. 2. 37, Viṣṇu Dh. S. 32. 6 have the same rule. But Gaut. II. 33 stutes an exception that on return from &amp; journey the student shall clasp the feet of the wives of his teacher (also Manu II. 217 and Viṣṇu Dh. S.32.15). Manu (II. 210) gives special directions &lsquo;the wives of the teacher who belong to the same casto must be treated as respectfully as the teacher but in the case of those who belong to a different caste he need only rise from his seat and salute&rsquo; ( Viṣnu Dh. S. 32.5 also is similar), and a student who is full twenty years old shall not honour the young wife of a teacher by clasping her feet ( Manu II. 212 and Viṣnu Dh. 8. 32. 13 ); but even a young student may prostrate himself on the ground for honouring the young wife of his teacher without clasping her feet (with the words ' abhivādaye amukasarmā-ham bhoh&rsquo;).</p>
<p>As regards women who are not wives of the teacher, the following rules deserve attention. The first rule is that married women, whatever their age may be, deserve honour (and so he must salute &amp;c. ) according to the ages of their husbands827 ( Ap. Dh. S. I. 4. 14. 18 and Vas. Dh, 8. 13. 42). Viṣpu Dh. 8. 32.2 gives the same rule, but restriots it to wives of the same caste. Ap. Dh. S. I. 4. 14, 6 prescribes that the same honour must be shown to the mother and father as to a teacher i, e. their feet must be olapsed on those occasions on which a teacher&rsquo;s feet are to be olasped and Ap. Dh, 8. I. 4. 14. 9 extends the rule to elder sisters. Gaut. (VI. 4-8) states that the feet of the wives of (elder) brothers or of one&rsquo;s mother-in-law</p>

<p>need not be clasped on any occasion; and the feet of a paternal uncle&rsquo;s wife or of elder sisters need not be clasped except when one returns from a journey. But Manu (II. 131-132) gives different rules. A maternal or poternal aunt, a maternal uncle&rsquo;s wife, a mother-in-law are equal to one&rsquo;s teacher&rsquo;s wife and must be honoured like her; one&rsquo;s elder brother&rsquo;s wife&rsquo;s feet must be clasped every day if she is of the same caste, but the feet of the wives of one&rsquo;s other paternal and maternal relatives need only be clasped on one&rsquo;s return from a journey. Viṣnu Dh. S. 32, 3 places a maternal or paternal aunt and the eldest sister on an equality with the teacher&rsquo;s wife. As already stated above in the case of all women the galutation is simply &lsquo;I salute&rsquo; ( abbivādaye aham)&rsquo; without mentioning one&rsquo;s name. Devala says &lsquo;the mother, mother&rsquo;s mother, teacher&rsquo;s wife and the full brothers and sisters of one&rsquo;s parents, paternal grand-mother, mother-in-law, elder sister and the foster mother are women who are ( to be honoured like ) gurus &lsquo;, 828</p>
<p>Āp. Dh. 8. 1. 2.7. 30, Vas. Dh. 8. XIII. 54, Viṣṇu Dh. 8. 28. 31, Manu II. 207 require that the student will behave towards the teacher&rsquo;s son as towards his teacher. That this rule is very ancient follows from a passage829 in the Mahābhāṣyai where it is stated and a proviso is added that the student will not however clasp the son&rsquo;s feet nor eat the leavings of his food. Āp. Dh. 8. I. 2.7.30 only mentions as prohibited the eating of the leavings of food, but Viṣnu Dh. 8. (28. 32-33) prohibits also the washing of the son&rsquo;s feet. Manu (II. 208) gives a restrictive rule that the son of the teacher deserves the same honour as &amp; teacher, if he imparts instruction in place of the teacher (because the latter is otherwise engaged), whether the son be younger or of the same age as the student, but that the student in any case must not shampoo the limbs of the son nor assist him in his bath nor wash his feet nor eat the leavings of his food,</p>

<p>Further rules are laid down about showing courtesy to a person who is not a relative or who is not a teacher &amp;o. Ap. Db. 8. I. 4. 14, 26-29 and Manu II. 127 lay down that one should, on meeting a brāhmaṇa, ask after his health with the word &lsquo;kuśala,&rsquo; a kṣatriya about his health using the word ' animaya&rsquo;, a vaisya by using the word kṣema (or anasta according to Āp.) and a sūdra by employing the word arogya. Thus one who is older (acoording to the rule in Manu II. 134 oited above on p. 339) should be saluted, while one who is of the same age or younger should simply be asked &lsquo;kuśala&rsquo; &amp;c. Gaut. V. 37-38 gives similar directions.831 Manu ( II. 129 ) enjoins that one should address a woman who is the wife of another man and who is not a blood relation as lady&rsquo; ( bhavati) or beloved sister' and (Ap.

S. 32.7 says that in such circumstances he must address her (in order to assure her) as &lsquo;sister&rsquo; ( if she is of the same age as himself) or ' daughter' ( if she is younger ) and mother (if she is older than himself).</p>

<p>Grounds for showing respect</p>
<p>their names and of the sūdra caste the word &lsquo;dasi&rsquo;. This is still the practice partioularly in Bengal and Northern India,</p>
<p>The works on Dharmajāstra give very interesting rules about the grounds on which respect was to be shown to a person. Honour 838 consists in saluting a person, or rising to meet him or allowing him to walk in front of one or giving him</p>
<p>&amp; garland, sandal-wood paste on festive occasions and the like. Manu (II. 136 ) and Viṣnu Dh. 8. (32. 16 ) say that wealth kindred, age, ( performance of ) religious rites and sacred know ledge confer title to respect, but each succeeding one out of these five is superior to each preceding one. Gaut. (VI. 18-20) is slightly different; he says &lsquo;wealth, relations; occupation, birth, learning and age must be honoured ; each later named is more important than each preceding one; but Vedio learning is more important than all (the rest)&rsquo;. Vas. Db, 8. 13. 56-57 also says that learning, wealth, age, relationship and religious actions are titles to respect, but each preceding one is more important than each succeeding one. Yāj. I. 116 puts the order as vidyā, karma, age, relationship and wealth (i. e, wealth is the least ground for giving honour). Visvarūpa on Yāj. I. 35 Bays that if respect is not paid to guru (parents ), ācārya, upādhyāya and ștvik ( they are arranged in descending order) one incurs sin, but if honour is not shown on the ground of learning, wealth &amp;o. there is no sin but one loses happi. ness and success. Manu II. 137 says that a sūdra who is beyond 90 years is still &amp; child to a learned brahmana. In order to show that Vedio learning is superior to seniority of age Manu (II. 151-153 ) narrates the story of a young soion of the Angiras gotra who taught his pitṛs and addressed them as * little sons' and whose action was supported by the gods with the romark that a man destitute of knowledge was a child and he who taught him the Veda was his father. This story is referred to expressly by Baud. Dh, S. I. 4. 47 and tacitly by Gaut. VI. 20. It is borrowed from the Tāndya Mahābrāhmaṇa 834</p>

<p>(13. 3. 24). Manu II. 155 clinches the argument by saying &lsquo;the seniority of brahmaṇas springs from (saored ) knowledge, of kpatriyas from valour, of vaisyas from (the possession) of corn and other wealth and only among sūdras is age a ground of seniority&rsquo;&hellip;</p>
<p>Kaut. says that men deserve honour according to their learning, intelligence, valour, high birth and eminent deeds.835</p>
<p>One has to distinguish between abhipādana and namaskāra. In the former one not only bows but utters words like &lsquo;abbi. vādaye &amp;c.&rsquo;, while in the latter one only bows and folds one&rsquo;s hands. The latter is done only to images of gode, brāhmaṇas, sampyāsins and the like. The Smrtyarthasāra p. 8 prescribes a fast for one day as a penance for not bowing to images of gods, sarnyāsins &amp;o. Visṇu838 ( quoted in the Sm. C.) says that one should not salute ( abhivadana ) a brāhmaṇa, but should only perform namaskāra in all public assemblies, in sacrifices or in palaces or royal courts. The posture of the hands is namaskara is stated as follows: &lsquo;One should join the bands in the shape of a shegoat&rsquo;s ear in namaskāra to a learned man, one should fold the hands together in bowing to an ascetio, one should salute an ignorant man with one hand and should not perform abhi vādana to one who is younger.837</p>
<p>One had to show respect by circumambulating838 from left to right temples or images of gods, bulls, cowpens, cows, ghee, honey, sacred trees that had brick or stone platforms built round them (like asvattha) and squares (where four roads meet), a teacher who is very learned, a learned and religious brāhmana, clay from Baored places.</p>
<p>One was not to approach empty-handed one&rsquo;s parents, acarya, sacred fires, houses and the king, if the latter has not heard of him before.889</p>

<p>Óh. VII] Learning from books</p>
<p>347</p>
<p>A matter closely connected with the showing of respeot is that of the rules about the preference to be given on the road. This has already been dealt with in speaking of the privileges of brahmaṇas above pp. 146–147.</p>
<p>One striking point about the imparting of knowledge (par ticularly Vedio ) in the ancient educational system of India Was the great prejudice against learning from books. The greatest importance was attached to handing down the Veda intact and various devices were discovered and employed for securing this end, such as the various modes of repeating the Veda only in padas, in the krama, jaṭā and other formations. Great care was taken to preserve the proper accentuation of the Vedic texts. There is a well known story how Tvastr repeating the words &lsquo;Indraśatrur-vardhas VA *840 in wrong accents caused the fire to be extinguished instead of inflaming it against Indra as he intended. This story is alluded to in the Papinlyasikṣā. The same work ( in verse 32 ) condemns one who learns from a manuscript as among the worst of learners. The Veda was to be recited not only with proper modulation of the voice to convey the accents, but the accents were indicated also by the movements of the fingers ( vide verses 43-45 of the Pāṇiniya sikṣā). All these intricate matters could be learnt only by oral instruction.</p>
<p>Great controversies have raged round the question whether the art of writing was known in India in very ancient times, whether it was used for literary purposes in the times of Panini and whether the Brahmi alphabet was an indigenous product or whether it was imported into India from some foreign land. Max Muller in his ' History of ancient Sanskrit Literature&rsquo; started the astounding and absurd theory that writing for literary pur. poses was unknown to Panini (p. 507). Later on that position</p>

<p>was given up. Then Bühler wrote his famous work on the origin of the Brahmi alphabet&rsquo; mainly relying on the regem blances of a few letters of the Asokan script with an ancient Semitic alphabet and came to the conolusion that the Brahmi alphabet was derived from a Semitio script sometimes about 800 B.O. It never occurred to that learned scholar to advance and carefully examine the other possible hypotheses which any unbiassed and cautious scholar should have ordinarily advanced viz, that the Semitic script might have been derived from the Brahmi alphabet and was later on developed or both might have been derived from some unknown ancient script. All these theories are now in the melting pot on account of the seals bearing writing in some undeciphered script found at Mohenjo daro and Harappa, some of which are at least 5000 years old. So if the Brāhmi alphabet was at all borrowed, it is clear now that it was not necessary for Indians to travel so far as Westernmost Asia for that purpose.</p>
<p>Oral instruotion was the cheapest and most accurate method of imparting learning. In anoient times writing materials were not easily available and written texts could not be handled easily and would have been extremely costly. Thereforo the method of oral instruction was resorted to and having been hallowed by the lapse of thousands of years it has been persisted in to the present day. Even in the 20th century after writing has been known for not less than 3000 years acoord ing to scholars like Bühler there are hundreds of brāhmaṇas who learn not only the whole of the Rgveda (about 10580 verses) by heart, but also commit to memory the pada 841 text of the Rgveda, the Aitareya Brābmapa and Aranyaka and the six Vedāngas ( which include the 4000 aphorisms of Panini and the extensive Nirukta of Yaska ) without caring to understand a word of this enormous material.</p>

<p>&amp; teacher does not shine in an assembly. Vļddha Gautama 843 condemns to hell those who sell the Veda, who condemn the Veda and those who write it down. Aparārka (p. 1114 on Yāj. III. 267-268 ) quotes verses from the Caturvinsatimata which prescribe various prāgascittas for selling the Vedas, the angas ( of the Veda), the smśtis, itihāsa and purāṇa, the secret pañoarātra (system ), gāthās, nitiśāstras &amp;o. The prejudice against using books for learning was carried so far that among the six obstacles in the path of the acquirer of knowledge, reliance on books is mentioned as one. $44 Aparārka (p. 390) quotes a long passage from the Bhavisyottarapurāṇa about the rewards of gifts of books of the epios and purānas to a brahmana or to a matha for the use of the public. A grant of the Valabhi king Guhasena I dated 559 A, D, refers to a colleo tion of books on the true dharma. 845 In the Kadambari (para 88 ) the queen Vilasavati is described as surrounded by ascetic women who held books in their hands and read itibāsa. 846 Vide under dāna and matha-pratiṣtha.</p>
<p>The teacher was expected to make the student understand by explanations in Sanskrit or in the prakrits or even by employing the current languages of the various countries. 847</p>
<p>The Duration of studenthood (brahmacarya) ;&mdash;It appears from certain passages of the Upaniṣads that the usual duration of brahmacarys was 12 years 848 Svetaketu Aruṇeya is said to have become a brahmacārl when he was twelve and to have mastered all the Vedas at the age of 24 (vide Chan.

<p>quoted in f. n. 634). Similarly Chān. IV. 10.1 appears to suggest that students left their teacher after twelve years of study. But a long period of brahmacarya was not unknown to the sages of the Upaniṣads. Ohāndogya ( VIII. 11. 3) declares that Indra remained as a student with Prajapati for 101 years (three periods of 32 years plus fire). The story of Bharadvāja narrated in the Tai. Br, quoted above ( at p. 271 ) states that Bharadvāja studied the Vedas three parts of his life (at least till 75 years ). The Gopatha Brāhmaṇa 849 (II. 5) states that the period of studenthood for learning all the Vedas is 48 years; that distributing that period in four portions among the vedas student-bood is for 12 years (for mastering one Veda ), that period (12 years ) is the shortest (for brahmacarya) and that one should learn of the Veda as much as one can before he is about to return from his teacher,</p>
<p>Some of the grhya and dharma sūtras contain these very words of the Gopatha Brābmapa e. g. Pār. gṛ. II. 5 says &lsquo;one should observe brahmacarya forty-eight years for the (four ) Vedas, or twelve years for each Veda or until one has learnt one or more Veda&rsquo;. The Baud. gr. ( I. 2. 1-5 ) has a very suggestive passage &quot; the ancient period of studenthood was forty-eight years for ( the four Vedas ) or 24 years, or 12 years for each Voda or at least one year for each kānda ( section of tbe Vedic samhitas like the Tsi. S.) or until the student learnt (one Veda ), as life is fleeting and as there is &amp; Vedic text &lsquo;one should consecrate ( the three ) Bacred fires, while his hair is still dark&rdquo;. On Jaimini I. 3.3 Sabara states the objection (among other similar matters ) that the smrtis speaking of brahın acarya for fortyeight years are opposed to the Vedic injunction that a man who has a son and whose hair is still dark should consecrate the three srauta ) fires (i.e. he must do Bo in middle life, not when his hair is turning grey).

<p>As the Vedio literature had grown to vast proportions and as it was thought necessary to preserve this ancient heritage, the ancient sages hit upon the plan of enlisting the whole population of the three varnas in the task of preservation by making it as their duty to devote as muob time as they could to the study and conservation of the Vedio literature. Therefore various alternatives were proposed viz. studying all the four Vedas for 48 years, three of them for 36 or if a man was very clever he may finish the study of tbree Vedas in 18 years or in 9 years or he should devote as much time as he would require for learning one Veda or more. Vide Manu III, 1-2 and Yāj. I. 36 and 52 for the various alternatives. Spending 12 years for Vedio</p>

<p>As upanayana was usually performed in the 8th year from conception or birth, the period of studenthood (if it was to be 48 years) would not ond till a inan became 56.

So if the man was to marry after fifty-six his bair would be turning grey and by following the smrti rule he would run counter to the Vedio injunction.

<p>study must have been found even in anoient times impossible for many among the brāhmaṇas and therefore the Bharadvāja gphys ( quoted above in note 850 ) allowed the alternative that one should study the Veda till the Godāna ceremony (whion as we shall see later on) took place in the 16th year. Akv. 87. sutra I. 22. 3-4 also prescribes only two alternatives for brahmacarya viz. for 12 years or as long as one could learn the Veda ( 80 Aśv. contemplated brałmacarya for less than 12 years ). Haradatta remarks on Āp. Dh. 8. I. 1. 2. 16863 that reading Ap. I. 1. 2. 12-16, I. 11.3.1 and Manu III. 1 together it follows that every one must observe brahmacarya for three years at least for each Veda and when it is said that one may observe brahmacarya till one learns the Veda, that means beyond three years for each Veda. This appears somewhat opposed to the words of Asv. and Bhāradvāja,</p>
<p>Not only was the study of the Veda made an absolute duty for all persons belonging to the three higher varpas, but the study of Veda was essential for the performance of the solemn Vedio sacrifices. Jaimini854 lays down that it is only be who knows the Vedic portion necessary for a Vodio sacrifice, that is entitled to perform that sacrifice.</p>
<p>Subjects of Study.&mdash;The study of the Veda means the study of the Mantras and the Brāhmaṇa portion of the partioular gakhā or bākhās.8The Vede was deemed to be eternal and not composed by any human author (1. e. it is apauruṣeya). Jaimini in I. 1, 6-23 establishes that the relation of word and sense is eternal and that ( in I. 1. 27-32) the Vedas are apauruṣeya. This is not the place to set out or examine the arguments. Alll dharmaśāstra writers proceed on this axiom of the eternity of the Veda. The Vedāntasūtra (1. 3. 28-29) says that the Vedas are eternal and the whole universe (including the gods ) emanates from the Veda</p>

<p>Greatness of the Veda</p>

<p>and reliance is placed on certain Upaniṣad passages and on Manu L 21, Santi-parva 233, 24 and other emptis. The Bṛ, Up. IV.5. 11 says that the Vedas are the breath of the great Being (i. e. the Supreme Spirit, God); in Bṛ, Up. I, %. 5 the Creator (Prajāpati) is said to have evolved all this viz. Rgveda, Yajurveda, Samaveda, yajñas and so forth. The Svetagvatara Up. VI. 18 says that the Supreme Being evolved Brahmi and imparted the Vedas to him.858 The Sāntiparva857 says that speeoh in the form of Veda is without beginning and without end, from which all activities and creation proceed, and that the Vedas become latent at the periodical dissolution of the world and become manifest to the great sages again when the world is recreated. But the eternity of the Veda and apauruṣ. eyatva of the Veda were interpreted in various ways e. g. the Mahābhagya says that, though the purport of the Veda is eternal, yot the arrangement of words is non-eternal and therefore there are various sākās ( branches or recensions ) of the Veda, named Kathaka, Kālāpaka &amp;0.858</p>
<p>From very ancient times the literature to be studied appears to have been rast. Vide Tai. Br. quoted above (at p. 271 ) where the Vedas have been declared to be endless. In the Rgveda itself (X. 71. 11 ) reference is made to the verses learnt by the four prinoipal priests ( hota, adhvaryu, udgātā and brahma ), it is also said that persons who studied together showed great disparity in their mental advancement (Rg.

<p>Brahmapas, Upanigads, itihāga, anpakhyāna, purana, anugi Banas, vākovakya &amp;o&rsquo;. In the Upaniṣads frequent mention is made of the literature studied by persons before they became seekers for the knowledge of brahma. For example, in Chān. Up. VII. 1. % Nārada tells Sanatkumāra that he had studied the four Vedas, Itihasa-purana as the fifth Veda, the Veda of Vedas ( grammar), pitrya ( treatise on sraddhas ), raśi (arithmetio), daiva (portents), nidhi (finding out hidden treasures ), vākovakya (dialogue or dialectic ), ekāyans ( politics ), devavidyā (Nirukta ), brahmavidyā (metres and phonetics ), bbūtavidyā (exorcising ghosts), kṣatravidyā (dhanurveda), nakṣatravidyā (astronomy ), sarpavidya (snake charms ), devajanevidya ( arts like danoing, singing, preparing unguents &amp;o.). The same list is repeated in Chan. Up. VII. 1. 4 and VII. 7. 1. In the Bs. Up.859 II. 4. 10 and IV. 5. 11 there is a similar smaller list. In the Mundaka Up. I. 1. 5 it is said that the āoārya Angiras told Saunaka who was a great householder that the four Vedas and the six angas (mentioned in note 775 above ) are inferior knowledge and that the highest knowledge is that by which the Imperishable One is apprehended. Gaut. XI. 19 exhorts the king to rely upon the Veda, dharmaśāstras, the angas, Upavedas and Purāṇa for regulating the conduct of his subjects. Ap. Dh. 8. ( quoted above in note 775), Viṣnu Dh. S. 30. 34-38, Vas. III. 19 and 23, VI. 9-4 mention the anges of Veda. Pāṇini shows acquaintance not only with the Veda and Brāhmapas but he know anoient Kalpasūtras, Bhikṣusutras and Natasutras, secular works on various subjects ( IV. 3. 87-88, 105, 110, 111, 116). Patañjali 360 ( 2nd century B. C.) mentions how vast the field of Sanskrit literature had become. Yāj.

I, 61. 78, Vrddha-Gautama (p.632) and other works, viz four vedas, 6 angas, purānas, nyāya (logic), mlmāmsā and dhar. maśāstra. Some added four more to these, viz. the Upavedas of Ayurveda, Dhanurveda, Gandharvaveda and Artbagāstra (which were affiliated respectively to the four Vedas) and thus the vidyās are also spoken of as 18.86% Kālidāsa in the Raghuvamsa (V. 21) expressly says that Varatantu taught his pupil 14 vidyās. In E.I. vol. VIII. p. 287 (in an inscription of 199 Guptasamvat i. e. 517-18 A. D.) it is said about Suśarman, an ancestor of Maharaja Samkṣobha, that he knew the highest truth because of his proficiency in the 14 vidya-stbanas&rsquo;. Kumārila 863 in his Tantravārtika (p. 201 ) says that vidyā-sthānas that are looked upon as authoritative in knowing dharma are 14 or 18. The Vārābagrhya (6) refers to different preparations for different people, viz. &amp; yājñika had to study mantra and Brāhmaṇa, kalpa ( vedic ritual ) and mimāṁsa and one could study at his option grammar, the smrtis and vaktra (?) and the grotriya only committed to memory the Veda; the first two were called snātakas. Numerous grants and insoriptions testify to the provision made by kings and well-to-do donors for all branches of study. In E.O. vol. III. T N. 27 there is a grant made by the minister Perumal under the Hoysala king Viranarasimhadava in 1290 A. D. which provided that each teacher of the Rgveda and the other Vedas was to receive &amp; salary of six gedyāṇakas of gold a year and the teacher who taught the boys to read Nagara, Kannada, Tigula (Tamil) and Arya (Marathi) was to receive the same salary. The Gadag inscription of the time of Vikramaditya VI. (1098 A, D.) refers to the founding of a school for teaching Prabhākara&rsquo;s system of Mimāmsā at Lakkigundi (E. I. vol. 15 p. 348 ). Vide E. I. vol. I. p. 338 ( for endow ment for teaching an astronomical work of Bhāskara).</p>

<p>enormous extent. On account of this vast literature many portions of which appealed more to the emotions and intellect than the Vedas could, the study of the Veda receded in the background and the study of subsidiary works became more popular. Therefore the smṛtis again and again raise their voice and try to impress it upon all that the first duty of a dvijāti is to study the Veda. The Maitri Up. VII. 10, though comparatively &amp; late work, inveighs against brāhmaṇas studying non-vedic texts.864 Manu (II. 168 ) says that the drija who, without study. ing the Veda, bestows labour upon another lore, is quickly reduced to the status of a śūdra in this very life together with his descendants. Kullaka on this verse cites the aphorism of Saṅkha-Likhita 868 &lsquo;one should not, without studying the Veda first, study another lore, except the Vedāngas and smṛtis&rsquo;. Vas. Dh.S. III. % expressly quotes the verse of Manu II. 168 as Mānava sloka. The Tai. Up. I. 9 speaks of svādhyāya (study of the Veda) and pravacana (teaching it or daily repeating it) as tapas and joins these two with sta, satya, tapas, 886 dama, dama, fires, agnihotra and progeny in order to emphasize that these two are the most important and it also exhorts the student on the eve of his return home not to neglect his study of the Veda.</p>
<p>The study of the Veda did not merely consist in learning the mantras by heart. Samkara in his bhāṣya on Vedāntasutra I. 3. 30 quotes a Brāhmaṇa text to the effect that he who teaches a mantra or officiates at &amp; sacrifice with mantras of which he does not know the seer, the deity or the Brāhmaṇa (i. e. viniyoga, employment or use) falls on a stump or in a pit. 887 The Mit. on Yaj. III. 300 quotes &amp; verse of Vyāsa to the same effect. Not only was the Veda to be committed to memory (i. e. not only was there to be pātha ) but one had also to understand</p>

<p>the meaning. The Nirukta (1. 18 ) quotes two verses 846 which condemn in very strong language one who only commits to memory the Veda and does not know the meaning that man, who having studied the Veda, does not know its meaning, is indeed a tree, a stump, a mere carrier of a load; he alone who knows the meaning secures all happiness; his sins being shaken off by knowledge, he reaches beaven'. Dakṣa 869 II. 34 says that the study of Veda involves five things viz. first committing to memory the Veda, then reflection over its meaning, keeping it fresh by repeating it again and again, japa ( inaudibly muttering by way of prayer) and imparting it to pupils. Manu XII. 103 says those who have committed to memory the Veda are superior to those who are ignorant of it, those who retain their Veda (i, e, who do not allow it to be forgotten ) are superior to those who only studied it (and then forgot it), those who know its meaning are superior to those who simply retain it in memory, those who perform what the meaning of the Veda diotates are superior to those who know</p>
<p>its meaning'. Sabara 879 says that the real purpose of the study of the Veda is the knowledge about religious actions that it conveys and that from the mere memorizing of the Veda, no rewards are promised by those who know the lore of the sacrifices. Visvarūpa 871 on Yāj. I. 51 says that he alone is really vedapāraga who has made the Veda his own as to the spirit ( the meaning ). Aparārka (p. 74 ) quotes a long passage from Vyāga condemning the mere memorizing of the Veda.878 Vide also Medhatithi on Manu III. 19.</p>

<p>In spite of these excellent precepts it appears that from very ancient times the Veda was only committed to memory and most men learned in the Veda never cared to know its meaning. The Mahabhārata 878 speaks disparagingly of the srotriya as having an intelleot dulled by the constant repetition of the anuvākas of the Veda. Further there was always an under current of the belief that the mere memorizing of the Vedic texts conferred great sanotity on the memorizer and removed all sing. As time went on these ideas became supreme and the neglect of the meaning of the Veda has gone so far that among many modern orthodox brāhmaṇas there is a belief that the meaning of the Veda cannot be known and it is futile to try to find its meaning. The Tai. Br. says that a man&rsquo;s Bins are destroyed by the Veda and by svādhyāya. In Vas. Dh, S. 27. 1, Manu XI. 245, Yāj. III. 310 and in numerous other places it is said that sins do not affect a nan who studies the Veda and that the study of Veda destroys sin. Vas. Dh. S. 28. 10-15 speaks of about 35 groups of Vedic hymns (like the Aghamarsana, Rg. X. 190 ) by silently muttering which a man is purified of his sins; but Vas. Dh. 8. 27. 4 is careful to add that Veda study only removes such sins as are committed through ignorance or carelessness,87* Similar provision for removal of sins by the muttering of the Vedic mantras is made in Viṣṇu Dh. S. 56.</p>
<p>1-27, Yāj. III. 307-309, Manu XI, 248-260 &amp;o.</p>
<p>Not only was the Veda to be committed to memory, but when learnt it was not allowed to slip from one&rsquo;s mind, Ap. Dh, S. I. 7. 21. 8 makes &lsquo;brahmojjha&rsquo;(i. e. abandoning what is learnt) &amp; grave sin along with drinking wine and others. Similarly Manu XI. 56 and Yāj. III, 228 also treat it as equal to drinking wine or the murder of a brāhmaṇa.</p>
<p>Similarly Manu IV.163 forbids nāstikya878 (bolding that there is no soul or no Hereafter ) and the reviling of the Veda and in</p>

<p>Reviling the Veda</p>

<p>XI. 56 regards the latter as a grave sin equal to drinking wine, while Yai III. 288 treats it as grave as brahmabatya. Gaut. 21. 1 mentions the nāstika among patitas along with brāhmana murderer and drinker of wine. Visṇu Dh. 8. 37. 4 includes the reviling of Veda among upapātakas ( lesser sins ). Manu II, 11 says that he who disrespects veda and smrti by relying on syllogistic reasoning is a reviler of Veda and a nāstika (atheist) and should be excluded from social intercourse by good men. Vas. Dh. S. XII. 41 says &lsquo;to hold the Vedas as unauthoritative, to carp at the words of the søges, and to be wavering on all points lead to one&rsquo;s destruction&rsquo;. Vide Viṣṇu Dh. 8. 71. 83 and Anusasanaparva 37. 11 for the same ( in the latter the 2nd pada is sāstrāṇām cabhilanghanam ).</p>
<p>Another striking feature of the anoient educational system was the total absence of any prior agreement about fees for teaching students. So early as Bṛ. Up. IV.1.2 we find Yājñavalkya</p>

<p>saying to king Janaka who offered to give him a thousand Cowo, an elephant and a bull ( or as Samkara explains an elephant like bull ), &lsquo;my father was of opinion that without fully teaching &amp; pupil one should not receive any reward from him &lsquo;.878 Gaut.877 (II. 54-55 ) says that at the end of his studies the student should request the teacher to accept the wealth that he could offer or ask the teacher what should be given and after paying or doing what the teacher wants or if the teacher allowed him to go without demanding anything, the student should take the ceremonial bath ( i. e. return home). The Asv. gr. ( III. 9. 4) has almost the same words. The Āp. Dh. 8.878 (1.2.7. 19-23 ) requires the student to offer at the end of his studies, whatever their extent may be, &amp; dakṣiṇā obtained from proper sources to his teacher according to his abilities and that if the teacher is in straightened circumstances, to offer him a fee even by begging from a person who is of the ugra caste or from &amp; sūdra and that after offering a fee or doing even a very strikingly good turn to his teacher he should not boast of it to others nor should he ever dwell in his mind over it. The ideal :Was that the dakṣiṇā (fee ) offered to the teacher at the end of study was simply for pleasing or propitiating the teacher and was not a complete equivalent of or compensation for the knowledge imparted. Manu ( IL 245-246 ) 88ys that the student need not give anything to the teacher till his snāna; when he is about to return home, he may offer to his guru some wealth; that the gift of a field, gold, a cow, or a horse, of even shoes or an umbrella, of a seat, corn, vegetables and clothes (either singly or together)may engender pleasure in the teacher, The Chān.

<p>letter to the pupil, there is nothing in this world by giving which the pupil oan get rid of the debt he owes. The Mahl bharata saya ( Advamedhika 56. 21 ) that the teacher&rsquo;s satisfac tion with the student&rsquo;s work and conduct is indeed the proper dakṣiṇā,881 Yaj. L. 51 says that one should give to his teacher what he chooses to ask as dakpiṇā and Katyayana888 quoted by Aparārka (p. 76 ) prescribes that a brāhmana pupil may give &amp; cow, a princely one a village, a vaibya a horse (if able to do so). It has been shown above (p. 355 ) how kings and others made gifts of lands or provided for salaries to teachers. One of the earliest record about university scholarships is contained in the Bahur ( near Pondiobery ) plates of Nfpatungavarman in which we find &amp; grant to &amp; Vidyasthana (&amp; seat of learning ) for promotion of learning (E. I. vol. 18 p. 5). In E. I. vol. 15 p. 83 there is provision of 30 mattars of land for professors leoturing to ascetios and of eight mattars to teachers giving lessons to the youths in a monastery (in the times of Calukya Somes vara I at Sūdi in Dharwar District in sake 981). The Peshwa distri. buted to learned brāhmaṇas every year dakṣiṇ&amp; which rose to 4 lakhs of rupees a short time before 1818 A. D. It may be stated that even in the 20th century there are numerous brāhmaṇa teachers of the Veda and the sāstras who. teach pupils for years without stipulating for any fee or even receiving any thing from them.</p>
<p>According to Manu II. 141, Saṅkbasmpti III.2 and Viṣnu Dh, 8. 29.2 a teacher who teaches the Veda or the Vedangas for money or for his livelihood is called an Upadhyāya. Yaj. III. 235 and Viṣnu Dh. 9. 37. 20 and others include teaching for money (and also learning from a paid teacher ) among upapata kas ( lesser sins). Manu III. 156, Anusasana 23. 17 and Yaj. I. 223 say that he who is a hired teacher (bhrtakādhyapaka ) and he who learns from such a teacher are not fit to be invited at a brāddha. But Medbātithi (on Manu II. 112 and III. 146), the Mit. (on Yāj. III. 235 ), the Sm, O. and others say that a person does not become a hired teacher by accepting something from a pupil, but that what is condemned is making a stipulation before hand that one would teach only if a certain sum or if so much</p>

<p>( Ch. VII were paid or delivered,888 In distress, Manu X. 116 and Y&amp;j. III. 4% allow even such stipulations for the purpose of securing one&rsquo;s livelihood,</p>
<p>The Mahabharata ( Adi. 133, 2-3) shows that when Bhiṣma appointed Drona as the teacher of the Pandava and Kaurava princes he bestowed on him wealth and a well-furnished house full of corn; but there was no stipulation.</p>
<p>It has been shown above (p. 113) that it was the king&rsquo;s duty to support learned mon and students and to see that no brāhmaṇa died of hunger in his kingdom (vide Gaut. X. 9-12, Viṣnu Dh. 8. III. 79-80, Manu VII. 82-85, Yāj. I. 315, 333 ). So a student, when the teacher demanded a heavy fee at the end of studies, could theoretically at least approach a king for the fee. Kalidasa draws in Raghuvamga V a graphic picture how Vara tantu demanded a dakṣiṇa of 14 crores from his pupil Kautsa who approached Raghu for the same and would not take more than his requirements. Sometimes the teacher or his wife, according to legends, demanded fanciful dakṣiṇās. For example, Utanka was asked by his teacher&rsquo;s wife, when he urged her to take something, to bring the ear-rings of the queen of the reigning king ( vide Adiparva chap. 3 and Afvamedhika-parve 56 ).</p>
<p>It would be interesting to see how far corporal punishment of pupils was allowed in ancient India. Gaut.884 (II. 48-50 ) lays down that pupils are to be regulated (ordinarily ) without beating ; but if it is not possible to control the pupil ( by words &amp;c. ) then he may be struck with a slender rope or with a split bamboo; that if the teacher struok (the pupil) in any other way (e. g. with the hand &amp;o.) the teacher should be punished by the king. The Ap. Dh. S. I. 2. 8. 29-30 calls upon the teacher to censure (by words ) a pupil when he commits &amp; fault and to employ according to the gravity of the offence any one or more of the following punishments till the pupil desists, viz. threatening ( the pupil), refusing to give him food, dronching him in cold water and not allowing him to come in his presence.885 The</p>

<p>. Corporal punishment of students</p>

<p>Mahābhāsya888 (vol. I. p. 41) refers to the fact that when a pupil pronounced a wrong accent (e. g. anudatta in place of udatta ) the upadhyāya slapped him (on the back probably ). Manu VIII, 299-300, Viṣṇu Dh. S. 71. 81-82, Nārada (abhyupetyd. susrūṣā, verses 13-14) follow Gautama as to corporal punishment, but add that beating should be on the back only and never on the head nor on the chest, while Nārada further rules that the beating should not be excessive. Manu (VIII. 300) says that the punishment in case of violation of these rules by the teacher is that for a thief and (VIII. 299 ) extends the same rules to the son and the wife. Manu II. 159 recommends that in imparting instruction about the right path of conduct, one should use sweet persuasive ( not high-toned ) words.</p>
<p>A few words must now be said about the education of kṣatriyas, vaisyas and kūdras. According to Gaut. XI. 3 a king should be well-grounded in the three Vedas and in Anvikṣiki (i.e.metaphysics) and in XI. 19 Gaut. says that the king has to rely for carrying out his duties on the veda, the dharmağāstras, the subsidiary lores of the veda, the upavedas and purāṇas. Manu VII. 43 and Yaj. I. 311 say that a king should be profi cient in the three Vedas, in metaphysics, in daṇdaniti (the art of government and statecraft) and in vārtā ( economio life and production of wealth). These directions were probably meant to be an ideal and very few kings ever went through all this. If any conclusions are to be drawn from the stories in the Mahabharata, we may say that princes at least hardly ever went to a guru&rsquo;s home, but teachers were engaged to teach them ( as Drona was engaged by Bhiṣma ) and they became proficient in military skill. Alberuni(tr. by Sachau 1888, vol. I p. 125) says that brāhmaṇas taught the veda to ksatriyas, but he is probably drawing only on the rules given in the smśtis. Kings left ecclesiastical matters to their purohita and were always to rely on him for advice. Gaut.887 XI. 12-13 and Ap. Dh, S. II. 5. 10. 16 require that the purohita was to be a learned man of good birth, endowed with polished speech, a fine form, middle age and high character and that he was to be well-versed in dharma and artha. Aśv. gr. III. 12 describes how the purobita is to prepare the king for battle. Kaut in his Arthasāstra after</p>

<p>stating several views gives his own opinion that the vidyās for a prince are four ( the same as those of Manu and Yaj. above), that after the caula is performed the prince should learn the alphabet and arithmetio and when upanayana is performed he should learn the four vidyās till he is 16 years old and may then marry (I. 5), that in the first part of the day he should have instruction in elephant riding and horse riding,riding in chariots and in arms and the latter part of the day he should devote to hearing purāṇas, stories, dharmaśāstra and arthasāstra (politics). In the Hathigumpha Inscription (2nd century B. C.) there is a reference to rūpa (currenoy ), gananā (finance and treasury accounts ), lekha (official correspondence ) and vyavahāra (law and judicial administration) as the subjects which Khāravela mastered as heir-apparent from his 15th year to his 24th ( vide E. I. vol.20 p.71 at p. 81, J. R. A. 8. 1918 p. 545, I. H. Q. vol. 14 for 1938 p. 459 ff.). In the Kadambari also Bapa shows that prince Candrāpida did not go to a teacher&rsquo;s house but that a school was built for him outside the capital where he learnt from his 7th to the 16th year.</p>
<p>As to the education of ksatriyas in general we have hardly any directions in the dharmaśāstra works. But that there were several learned ksatriyas and vaisyas who sometimes became teachers cannot be denied. Kumārilabhatta says ( on Jaimini I. %. 2) that adhyāpana888 is not a special characteristic for recognising that a man is a brāhmaṇa, since certain kṣatriyas and vaisyas who have given up the observation of the caste rules also do so.</p>
<p>About the education of vaisyas there is still less material. Manu X. 1 lays down generally that the three varnas ( includ ing vaisyas) are to learn the Veda, (X. 79 ) that trade, cattle rearing and agriculture are the means of the vaisya&rsquo;s livelihood and that (IX.328-332) the valsya should never think of giving up cattle rearing, that he should know the prices of jewels, coral and pearls, of metals and clothes, of perfumes and salt, the Bowing of seed, the qualities and defects of soils, measures and weights, the different grades of qualities of goods, the profit and loss in trade, the rates of pay for servants, various alpha. bets and the places where saleable artioles are produced or manufactured.</p>

<p>Yaj. II. 184, Nārada ( abhyupetyāsusrūṣa 16-20) indicate that boys were apprenticed with master artisans to learn several filpas (crafts) like preparing ornaments 889 of gold or for learning dancing, singing &amp;o. An apprentice was to stipulate how long he would stay with the master craftsman, that even if he learnt the craft earlier than the stipulated time he was still to stay with the teacher and work for him till the period was over, that the teacher was to give food and lodging to the apprentice and to appropriate the proceeds from his work, that if the apprentice left the teacher before the time fixed even though the teacher was ready to teach him, he was to be compelled to stay with the teacher and to be imprisoned or Bentenced to whipping by the king if he would not stay.</p>
<p>As for the education of the sūdra, there are hardly any rules in the dharmaśāstras. He gradually, as stated above ( at pp. 120-121), rose in status and was allowed to engage in orafts and agriculture and so the same rules might have been applied to him as to vaisya apprentices. The sūdra oould listen to the recitation of the Mahabharata and the purāṇas as shown above ( at pp. 155-156 ).</p>
<p>It appears that in very ancient times the status of Indian women as to education was much higher than in medieval and modern times in India. Several women are stated to have been the composers of Vedic hymns; e. g. Rg. V, 28 is ascribed to Vibyavārā of the Atri family ; Rg. VIII. 91 to Apālā of the same family and Rg. X. 39 to Ghoṣā Kākṣivati. The Bs. Up. II. 4. 1. shows that Maitreyi, one of the two wives of Yāja. valkya, the great philosopher of ancient India, was herself a very earnest seeker after true knowledge and she prayed to Yājñavalkya that he should impart to her such knowledge as would make her immortal.890 In the same Upaniṣad (III. 6 and 8) we find that among the several interlooutors in the court of Janaka, king of Videha, who propounded several questions for solution before Yajñavalkya, Gārgi Vacaknavi ocoupies &amp; very prominent position. She pursued Yājāavalkya with subtle and searching questions till ultimately he was forced to warn her</p>

<p>not to probe too much into the nature of the First Principle which was beyond mere human reason and logical questioning or otherwise she might die by the fall of her head. Then she desisted, but her unquenchable thirst for pbilosophical knowledge again gwelled up and she put two questions to Yajavalkya hoping to confound him. In the same Up. (Bṛ. Up. VI. 4. 17 ) there is a rite prescribed 89&rsquo; for one who desires to have a learned daughter. As in the very preceding sentence &amp; prescription is given for one desirous of having a son who would master the three Vedas, it naturally follows that the learning of the daughter must refer to the same topio. But Samkara, in whose day women were debarred from learning the Vedas, could not but explain the word &lsquo;pandita&rsquo; as referring to proficiency in domestic work. It has been shown above (p. 294) that upanayapa and veda study were allowed to women by Harita. In the daily rṣitarpana ( Asv. gr. III. 4) among a host of sages water is offered to three women as teachers viz. Gārgi Vacaknavi, Vadavā Pratitheyl and Sulabha Maitreyi. The very fact that the Kasika on Pāṇini IV. 1. 59 and III. 3. 21 teaches the formation of acārya and upadhyāya as meaning &amp; woman who is herself a teacher (and not merely the wife of a teacher) establishes that the ancient grammarians were familiar with women teachers. Patañjali teaches 898 how and why &amp; brahmana woman is called Apisala (one who studies the gram mar of Apisali) and Kaśakrtsnā (one who studies the mimanga work of Kāśakṣtsna). He also states the formation of the appellation&rsquo; Audameghāḥ' (meaning the pupils of a woman teacher called Audameghyā). Gobhila 892 gr. II. 1. 19-20 prescri bes that when the bride pushes forward with her foot a mat the bridegroom should make her repeat the mantra &lsquo;may the way which my husband goes by be also assigned to me&rsquo; and that if she does not repeat this mantra ( through bashfulness &amp;o.) he</p>

<p>should repeat it substituting the words &lsquo;to her&rsquo; for &lsquo;to me&rsquo;. In the Kathaka 894 gr. 25. 23 it is said that the Anuraka beginning with &lsquo;sarasvati predam-ava&rsquo; ( of 21 vorges) was to be recited both by the bride and the bridegroom acoording to some teachers. All this shows that women could recite Vedio mantras in the gūtra period. The Kāmagūtra of Vatsyāyana, 895 &amp; remarkable though in some places &amp; filthy work, prescribes that women should study the Kamasutra and its subsidiary angas (vim the 64 kalās such as singing, dancing, painting &amp;o.) before they attain youth (i.e. in their father&rsquo;s house) and after marriage with the husband&rsquo;s consent. In the 64 kalās enumerated in that work (I. 3. 16 ) are included prahelikās ( riddles of words ), pustakavācana (chanting from books ), kāvyasamasyd-pūraṇa ( composing a suitable portion of a verse to fit in with a portion given ), knowledge of lexicons and metres &amp;o. We read in the epics and the dramas like the Sakuntala of women writing messages to their lovers. In the Malatimadhava Bhavabhūti tells his readers that the fathers of the hero and the heroine studied in their youth together with Kāmandakı at the feet of the same master. From anthologies like Rājasekhara&rsquo;s Sāktimuktavali we learn that there were poetesses like Vijja, Sitā &amp;o. All these facts tend to indioate that literary attainments among women were not totally unheard of in ancient India.</p>
<p>But gradually the position of women became worse and worse. In the Dharmasutras and Manu woman is assigned a position of dependence and even women of higher classes came to be looked upon as equal to śūdras so far as Vedic study and several other matters were concerned. Gaut. 18. 1, Vas. Dh, S. VI. 1, Baud. Dh. 8. IL. 2. 45 and Manu IX. 3 say that women have no independence and in all stages depend upon men. We have seen (at p. 265) also that all the samskāras (except marriage) were performed in the case of girls without Vedic mantras. Though according to the Pūryamimāmsā the husband and wife were to perform Vedio sacrifices together (Jaimini VI. 1. 17-21) still women 496 were only Associated with their husbands and all the</p>

<p>aotions to be done by the sacrificer (yajamāna ) were to be done only by the husband except where the texts expressly requested the wife to do certain things such as examining the djya or repeat ing certain mantras (VI. 1.24), Jaimini says that the husband and wife were not equal and Sabara explains that the yajamina is a male and is learned, while the patni is a woman and has no vidya. Medhātithio? on Manu II. 49 raises the interesting question why brabmacāring when begging for alms used a Sanskrit formula (bhavati bhikṣām debi) which language ladies do not know. He replies that women can understand that vernacular words which they use being similar to Sanskrit words must be derived from them and that these few well known Sanskrit words they can easily grasp. Besides even in Vedio times there was a tendency as in many other countries to make sarcastio references to women. The Rgveda898 VIII. 33. 17 Bays&rdquo; Even Indra said &lsquo;the mind of woman cannot be control led; and also her intellect (or power) is slight&rsquo;&quot;; in Rs. X. 95. 15 898 there is no truth in the friendship of women ; they have the hearts of hyaenas'. The Sat. Br. XIV. 1.1.3 exhorts a person studying the Madhu-vidyā not to look at &lsquo;woman, sūdra, the dog and the black bird that are all untruth&rsquo;. In Manu IL 213-214, Anusaganaparva chap. 19. 91-94, chap. 38 and 39 there is severe condemnation of woman. Such ideas, and ideas about pollution and the early marriage of girls are probably responsible for the great lack of literacy among women in medieval and modern times.</p>
<p>As literary education among women was in a languishing state or almost nil, the question of co-education hardly arises, There are no doubt faint indications that when women could at all devote themselves to learning, they must have been taught with male pupils. Poets like Bhavabbūti (in the Mālati madhava) envisage a state of society in which &amp; woman (like Kamandakı) learnt at the feet of the same master along with male students (like Bhūrivasu and Devarāta, who later on became ministers of states ).</p>

<p>The house of the acārya where the student learnt was called do&amp;ryakula (vide Chān. Up. II. 23. 2, IV. 5. 1., IV. 9. 1, VIII. 15. 1). The teacher who presided over a large establishment of pupils was called kulapati (e. 8. Kanva is so referred to in the Sākuntala, vide note 134 above).</p>
<p>It is outside the scope of this work to show from the numerous inscriptions and copper-plate grants that have been published so far, how ancient kings and rich private persons made substantial grants to famous schools, colleges and univer sities. There were famous universities at Takṣaśilā ( modern Taxila ), Valabbi, Benares, Nalanda, Vikramasilā &amp;c. For an account of the university of Nālandā in the 7th century reference may be made to the accounts given by the two Chinese travellers Yuan Chwang ( vide Watters vol. II, pp. 109, 246 ) and Itsing (&lsquo;Records of the Buddhist Religion&rsquo; by Dr. Takakusu pp. 154, 177 &amp;c.). Most of those seats of learning were endowed. One of the earliest of such grants is that of the Pallava Nṛpatunga-varman ( Bahur Plates, E. I. 18 p. 5) whereby three villages were bestowed as a source of revenue (vidyābhoga ) for the promotion of learning to the residents of a seat of learning ( vidyāsthāna, a college ) at Vāgūr, The Kāvye mimāṁsā of Rājaśekbara ( in chap. 10) calls upon the king to hold assemblies of poets and learned men, to arrange for their examination and to distribute rewards to them in the manner of such ancient kings as Vasudeva, Sātavāhana, Sūdraka, Sābasānka. It also says that in Ujjayini such poets as Kalidāsa, Mentha, Bhāravi, Haricandra were examined and in Pataliputra (modern Patna) such fainous śāstrakāras as Pāṇini, Vyādi, Vararuci, Patañjali, Varṣa, Upavarṣa, and Pingala were examined.</p>
<p>The salient features of the educational system outlined in the Dharmaśāstra works are the high and honourable position assigned to the teacher, the close personal contact of the pupil with the teacher and individual attention, the pupil&rsquo;s stay with the teacher as a member of his family, oral instruction and the absence of books, stern discipline and oontrol of emotions and the will, cheapness (as no fees were stipulated for). The Indian system compares most favourably with any systein of education of the West, whether in Greece or Rome or any other country. It gave to the students a more or less literary educa tion, particularly of the Vedio literature and of philosophy, grammar and other subjects ancillary thereto. The principal</p>

<p>History of Dharmaśāstra</p>
<p>[ Ch. VII</p>
<p>effort was directed towards the conservation of the ancient literature rather than to the creation of fresh literature. In these respects it was similar to the Grammar Schools of England and to the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge as they were till about the middle of the 19th century. The defects of the Indian system were that it was too literary, there was too much memorizing, boys under it had hardly any instruction in useful manual arts and crafts, the studies were not brought in contact with practical life. The discipline was rigorous and joyless. Many of these defects were due to the exigencies of the caste system which assigned particular avocations to particular castes. We cannot and should not compare the system with the systems of education prevalent in the 20th century, when several subjects such as literature, music and the fine arts, bandicrafts, mathematios, science, history and geography are taught in the schools to all boys and when it has been recog nised that education is a prime concern of the State.</p>
<p>The four Veda-vratas :-Among the samskāras enumerated by Gautama there are four Veda-vratas (Gaut. VIII. 15). These four are also included in the 16 samskāras by several smṛtis. Their names and procedure differ considerably in the several grhyasūtras. Some grhyasūtres like Pār. do not describe them. A brief reference will be made to them here. The Aśv. gr. I. 22. 20 600 says in general words that in the vratas all the ceremonies beginning from shaving the head up to paridāns ( i. e. Āśv. gr. I. 19. 8 to I. 20.7) that are performed at the upapayana are repeated each time with each vrata. And the four yratas according to the Aśvalāyana smrti ( in verse) were Mahānāmni vrata, Mahāvrata (Ait. Ār. I. and V), Upaniṣad vrata and Godāns. Each vrata is to be performed for a year. Vide Laghu Asvalāyana 11th section ( Ānan. Ed). The śān. gr. ( II. 11-12 ) describes, after the student is instructed in the sacred Gayatri, four vratas (observances ) called Sukriya (whioh precedes the study of the main part of the Rgveda ), the Sakvara, Vrātiks and Aupaniṣada vratas ( which three precede the study of the different sections of the Aitareya Aranyaka). The observance of the first of these (viz. Sukriya) lasted for three days or twelve days or one year or as long as the teacher liked and the observances of the other three were to be kept for one year each ( Sān. gr. II. 11. 10-12, S. B, E. vol. 29</p>

<p>The Veda-vratas</p>
<p>371</p>
<p>p. 77). At the beginning of each of these three vratas there is a separate upanayana, followed by a ceremony called Uddik ṣanikā (giving up the preparatory observances) and then the vrata is to be performed for one year. The Ārapyaka is to be studied in the forest out of the village. Manu II. 174 prescribes that at the time of the beginning of each of these vrates the student hall to put on a new deer skin, a new yajñopakita and a new girdle. The Gobhila gļhya III. 1. 26-31 (which is connected with the Sāmaveda) mentions the vratas as Godānika, Vrātika, Aditya, Aupaniṣada, Jyestha-Eāmika, each lasting for one year. It adds that some do not observe the Aditya-vrata. The godāna vrata is connected by the Gobhillya with the samskāra of godāna ( to be described below) and it prescribes certain observances for it such as removing all hair on the head, chin and lips; avoiding false-hood, anger, sexual intercourse, perfumes, dancing and singing, collyrium, honey and meat; not wearing shoes in the village. It also prescribes that wearing the girdle, begging for food, carrying &amp; staff, daily bath, offering a fuel-stick, and clasping the teacher&rsquo;s feet in the morning are common to all vratas. The Godā nika enabled the student to study the Pūrvārcika of the Sā maveda (i. e, the collection of verses sacred to Agni, Indra and Soma Pavamāna ). The Vrātika was introductory to the study of the Āranyaka (excluding Sukriya sections ); the Aditya vrata to the study of the Sukriya sections; the Aupaniṣada-vrata to the study of the Upaniṣad-brahmana; the Jyestha-sāmika to the study of the Ajga-dohas. The Kh. gr. II. 5. 17 ff. speaks of the same vratas as Gobhila, Those who observe the Adityavrata wore one garment, did not allow anything to come between them and the sun (except trees and the roofs of houses) and did not descend into water more than knee-deep. The Sākvara vrata was kept for one year, or for three or six or nine. Those who observe this vrata study the Sakvarl or Mahāpārni Verses. Vārtika901 on Panini V.1.91. (tadasy&amp; brahmacaryam) mentions the Mabānāmnis and teaches the derivation of Mahānāmnikam (as the period of brahmacarga devoted to the vrata of the Mahānāmnis ).

<p>this such as bathing thrice a day (Gobhila III. 2. 7-46, Kh. gr. II. 5. 23 ff.), wearing dark clothes, partaking of dark food, standing by day, sitting by night, not seeking shelter when it is raining, not crossing &amp; river without bathing in it ( the virtue of the Mabānāmnis is centred in water). After the student has kept his vow for one-third of the time prescribed the teacher is to sing to the student the first stotriya of the Mahānāmnis 80% (viz. the three mantras, vidā maghavan, abhiṣtvam, evābi sakro) and in the same way the two other stotriyas ( each consisting of three mantras). They are to be sung to the student who has fasted, has closed his eyes, has dipped his hand in a brass vessel full of water in which all sorts of herbs are thrown and whose eyes are veiled with a new piece of cloth, the student is to keep silent and abstain from food for one day and nigbt (or three ), to stand in the forest till sunset (and return to the village in the night ), should sacrifice with mahāvyāhtiis; look at fire, clarified butter, the sun, a brāhmana, a bull, food, water and curds; then salute the teacher, break his silence and give a fee to the teacher and offer a mess of cooked food to Indra and give a dinner to the teacher and all co-students. The same rules apply to the Jyesthasāmika vrata (introductory to the study of the three Ājyadohas 808 viz. &lsquo;mūrdhānam divaḥ, tvām visve, nābhim yajñānām). The student who undergoes this has to observe certain rules throughout his life viz. he cannot marry or bave sexual intercourse with a sūdra woman, cannot eat bird&rsquo;s flesh, he should not restrict himself to one kind of corn or one country and should always wear two garments, should bathe in water drawn with a vessel and should not eat in an earthen pot or drink water from it.</p>
<p>The Baud. gr. III.2. 4 ff says that there are vratas of one year each which precede the study of certain brāhmaṇa texts ( of the Krsna Yajurveda ); they are hotāraḥ ®, kukriyas, upaniṣadaḥ,</p>

The Samskāra-kaustubha ( pp. 571-580 ) gives in some detail the procedure of the Malā. nāmnī vrata, Mahāvrata, Upaniṣadvrata and Godānavrata. It states that the Mahānāmnivrata is performed in the 13th year from birth and Godānavrata in the 16th. It appears, however, that these vratas gradually fell into desuetude and medieval writers often paes them over altogether or barely mention them and emphasize only the general observances of brahmacārins viz. celibacy, begging for food, avoiding honey, wine and singing &amp;c. For example, the Smrtyarthasāra 908 (p. 6 ) refers to Savitrivrata, then tho vrata for Vedic study and then the Āranyaka vratas. The Mit. on Yāj. I. 52 ( vedam vratāni vā pāram nitrā) explains &lsquo;vratam&rsquo; as simply the duties of the student already enumerated by Yāj. (among which the specifio vratas of Mabānāmni &amp;o, do not figure).</p>
<p>If the student failed in observing the specific vratas, he had to perform prāyaścitta by undergoing the prājāpatya ponance thrice or six times or twelve times. If the brahmacāri is guilty of failing in his daily duties of observing sauca and ācamana, of the performance of samdhyā prayer, of using darbho, of begging for food, of offering fuel stick to fire, of avoiding the touch of sūdras and the like, of wearing the cloth (for covering his private parts ), the loin thread, the yajño. pavita, the girdle and the staff and deorskin, of not sleeping by day, of not holding an umbrella over his head or of not wear ing shoes, or not putting on garlands, of avoiding luxurious bath, sandal paste, collyrium, of not sporting in water, of avoiding gambling, and addiction to dancing, singing and music, of not engaging in conversation with heretios, he had to undergo the penance of three krcchras ( according to Baudhā. yana ) and to perform a homa with the vyābṛtis separately and together (i. e, four oblations of clarified butter were to be offered).906 If he was guilty of other more serious lapses he</p>

<p>had to undergo heavier penance. The most reprehensible act in a brahmacārin was to have sexual intercourse with a woman, The Tai. Ār. II. 18 speaks of the prayascitta for such a bralımacārin who is called avakirnin. Gaut. 25, 1-2 quotes the Tai. Ār. &ldquo;they (the sages 1007 say &lsquo;in how many ( deities) the avakirṇin enters; (the answer is ) he enters the Maruts with his breath, Indra with his strength, Bșhaspati with his spiritual eminence and fire with the rest (of bis senses )'&rdquo; and Gautama further provides that he should kindle fire at midnight on a new moon day and then offer two ājya oblations by way of penance with the two mantras &ldquo;kāmāva-&lsquo;and&rdquo; Kāmāyadrugdhosmi&rsquo; &amp;c., place a fuel stick on fire, sprinkle water round the fire, offer the yajñavāstu oblation (for which see Gobhila gr. I. 8. 26-29) and standing near the fire should worship fire thrice with the versesam mā siñcantu&rsquo;. Baud. Dh. S. (IV. 2. 10-13) contains the same rules. Jaiminio08 ( VI. 8. 22) prescribes that ordinary (laukika) fire is to be used for the pasu to be saorific od ( viz. ass to Nirpti, which is symbolic of the stupid lapse the student is guilty of ) and Sabara quotes a Vedio passage that&rsquo;a brahmacārin who has become avakirnin should sacrifice an ass to Nirfti&rsquo;. Āp. Dh. S. 1. 9. 26. 8, Vas. 23. 1-3, Manu XI. 118-121, Yaj. III. 280 contain similar provisions ( Vasiṣtha allowing in the absence of an ass oblations of boiled rice with the mantras mentioned by Gautama). Manu XI. 122–123 and Viṣnu Dh, S. 28. 49-50 prescribe that the brahmacāri so guilty should for one year wear the skin of the ass, should beg for food at seven bouses announcing to them bis lapse, should take food only once, should bathe thrice and then only he becomes pure. Manu II. 187 ( =Viṣpu Dh. S. 28. 52) prescribes similar pedance for &amp; brahmacārl who without being ill gives up begging for food and offering fuel to fire continuously for seven days. Prāgaścitta is prescribed for loss of yajnops vita or its being torn, or its being polluted by impure tbings</p>

<p>Naisthika brahmacūrin ( perpetual student).</p>
<p>Brahmacārins were of two kinds, upakurvāṇa (the student who offered some return to the teacher, vide Manu II. 245, for the word upakurvita ) and the naiṣthika 809 ( the student who remains so till his death). These two names occur in Harita Dh. S., Dakṣa 1.7 and in several smptis. Tbe word &lsquo;naiṣthika&rsquo; occurs in Viṣnu Dh. 8. 28. 46, Yāj. I. 49, Veda-Vyāga 1. 41. The idea of perpetual studenthood is very ancient. In the Chandogya 910 Up. II, 23. 1 we read that the third branch of dharma is the ( status of a ) student who stays with his teacher&rsquo;s family and who wears out his body to the end in the family of the teacher, Gaut. III. 4-8, Āp. Dh. S. I. 1. 4. 29, Hārita Dh. 911 S., Vas. VII. 4-6, Manu II. 243, 244, 247-249, and Yāj. J. 49-50 say that if tbe student likes he may stay with his teacher till life lasts and should serve his guru and in the rest of the time repeat the Veda; that if the teacher be dead he may stay with and serve the teacher&rsquo;s son if he is worthy or the teacher&rsquo;s wife or he may worship the fire kindled by his deceased guru; he should thus wear out his body; he obtains the highest worlds of bliss and is not born again. He has to perform throughout his life the duties of offering fuel sticke, Veda study, begging for food, sleeping on the ground ( not on a cot), and of self-restraint (Bphaspati quoted in Sm. C. I. p. 62 ).</p>

<p>dwarfs, ill-formed, congenitally blind, impotent, cripples and those suffering from incurable diseases should become perpetual students, as they are not entitled to perform the Vedic rites and are not entitled to inherit. We saw above that Kumārilabhatta accepted this view ( vide note 852a). But this does not mean that the blind and other partially dofective people could not marry at all. They could marry if they had sufficient wealth. For example, Dbṛtarāstra, though congenitally blind, married and had song. Aparārka (p. 72 ), the Sm, C., the Madanepāri. jāta (p. 111 ), the Par. M. (I. 2. p. 51 ff) and others say that perpetual student-bood is not restricted only to the blind and the cripple, but it may be resorted to by even able-bodied men at their choice ( vide Manu II. 243-44).</p>
<p>Atri ( VIII. 16 ) says 913 that if a person undertakes to be &amp; perpetual student, but falls from that ideal, there is no prāyas. citta for that lapse. Somne interpret this as applying to one who becomes &amp; samnyāsin and then gives up that mode of life ; while others like the Samskāra-prakāśa (p. 564 ) interpret it as meaning that the prāyascitta is double of what the upakurvāṇa would have to undergo.</p>
<p>Patitasāvitrika (those for whom there has been po upana. yang and therefore no instruction in Gāyatri and who are therefore sinful and outside the pale of Aryan society ). The gphya and dharma sūtras are agreed that the time for upang yana has not passed till the 16th, 22nd and the 24th year in the case of brāhmaṇas, ksatriyas and vaiśyas respectively, but that after these years are past without upangyana taking place they become incompetent thereafter for learning the Sāvitrī (the sacred Gayatri verse) Vide ĀŚv. gr. I. 19,5-7, Baud. gr. III. 13. 5-6, Ap. Dh. S, I. 1. 1. 22, Vas. XI. 71-75, Manu II. 38-39, Yāj. I. 37-38. Such persons are then called patitasāvitrika or gāvitripatita and also vrātya (Manu II. 39 and Yāj. I. 38 call them so ). These works ot also declare that the consequences of this are that no upangyana is to be thereafter performed for them, they are not to be taught the Veda, nor is any one to officiate at</p>

<p>their sacrifices and there is to be no social intercourse with them (i. e. no marriage takes place with them). Ap. Dh. S. (I. 1. 1. 24-27 ) prescribes that after the 16th or 24th year, the person should undergo the rules of student-bood two months just as those who meant to study the three Vedas and whose upanayana has been performed observe (viz. begging for food &amp;c.), then his upanayana should be per formed, then for one year he should bathe (thrice if possible ) overy day and then he should be taught the Veda. This is a somewhat easy penance. But others prescribe heavier penalties. Vas. Dh. 8. XI. 76-79 and the Vaik. smārta II. 3 prescribe that one who is patitasavitrika should either perform the Uddalaka vrata or should take a bath along with the performer of an Aśramedha sacrifice or should perform the Vrātyastoma sacrifice. Both Vasiṣthaois and the Vaik. smārta explain that the Uddalaka vrata consists in subsisting on barley gruel for two months, for one month on milk, for half a month on.āmikṣā (the whey that arises by pouring curds in hot milk), for eight days on ghee, for six days on alms obtained without begging, for three days on water and in observing &amp; total fast for one whole day. The Sm. C. (I. p. 28 ) says that this vrata is so called becauge it was promulgated by Uddalaka. Manu XI. 191 and Viṣnu Dh. S. 54. 26 prescribe a mild pray$&amp; citta for palitasāvitrikas, viz. three prājāpatya 96 penances; while Yaj. I. 38, Baud. gì. III. 13.7, Veda-Vyāsa I. 21 and several others prescribe only the Vrātyastoma for those who are patitasāvitrikas. Visvarūpa 917 (on Yāj. III. 262 ) tries to reconcile these contradictions by saying that the easy penance prescribed by Manu applies to a brāhmaṇa whose upanayana is not performed before the 16th year, but whose upanayana is Bought to be performed before the 22nd year, while the Vrātya stoma is to be performed for him whose upanayana is not</p>

<p>Ap. Dh.

It then prescribes that they have to perform the penance (observing rules of student-hood) ono year for each generation (that had not the upanayana perform od), then there is upanayana and then they have to bathe (thrice or once) every day for a year with certain mantras viz. the seven Pāvamāni verses beginning with &lsquo;yad anti yacca durake&rsquo; (Rg. IX. 67. 21-27), with the Yajuṣ.pavitra (Tai, S. I. %. 1. 1=Rg. X, 17. 10), with the sūmapavitra and with the mantra called Angirasa (Rg. IV. 40.5) or one may pour water only with the vyābstis 19. After all this is done, one may be taught the Veda. Ap. Dh, S. goes further (I. 1. 2. 5-10) and days if the generations 920 beginning with the great-grand father had not the upanayana performed on them, they are called the cemetery and that if there is desire they may observe the rules of student-hood for twelve years, then</p>

Haradatta *} remarks that Āp. does not declare the prāyascitta for him whose great-grandfather&rsquo;s father also was without upanayana, but that those who know the dharmaśāstra should find out a proper prāyaścitta even in such cases. It is clear that Ap. contemplates cases where for three generations there had been no upanayana and the fourth generation also had not the upanayana performed at the right time and desired to have it performed for him. Pār. gives a brief rule when three generations are patitasāvitrika, their offspring (i. e. the fourth generation) is excluded from the sacrament of upanayana and he cannot be taught the Veda.' 528 So Pār. is more restrictive than Āpastamba.</p>
<p>There is a famous historical example of the application of these rules. Gāgābhatta, a profound scholar of Benares, officiated at the coronation of Shivaji, the founder of the Maratha Enpire, in 1674 and performed the upanayana of Shivaji before the coronation, when Shivaji was about 45 years old and had even two sons. Some eminent scholars like the late Mr. Justice Telang 94have found fault with Gāgabhatta</p>

<p>The Vaik, sūtra (II. 37 ) adds that in the case of the man who is himself patitasūvitrika the saṁskāras (from Garbh.. dhāna ) have to be again performed ( with Vedio mantras ) and then the upanayana is performed.</p>
<p>One very important question that exercised the minds of some writers in medieval timos was whether kṣatriyas and vaidyas existed in the kali age. In some of the purāṇas it is said in a pro phetio voin that Mahāpadma Nanda will destroy the ksatriyas and thereafter rulers will be of the sūdra caste. For example, the Viṣnupurāpa IV. 23. 4-5 says &ldquo;Mabāpadma Nanda, the son of Mahānandi, born of a sūdra woman would be extremely greedy (of power) and will destroy the whole kṣatriya race as if he were another Paraśurāma; thereafter sūdras will be kings'. The Matsya 272. 18-19 and the Bbāgavata-purāṇa XII. 1. 6-9 declare the same prophecies. The Viṣnupurāpa IV. 24.44 remarks that Devāpi, descendant of Pūru, and Manu, descendant of Ikṣvāku, stay in</p>

But the role of a historian is entirely different. Ho must not only try to read all evidence available till the timo be writes but he must bimself ferret out all possible evidence and make soarches in places where evidence is likely to be found. Above all ho must be cautious in bis condemnations of persons long dead on the strengtb of the meagre evidenco read by him. Mr, Telang wrote the paper above referred to in 1892, but long before that Paraskara (in 1886 ) and Āpastamba (in 1885) had been translated and published in the Sacred Books of the East series. But he, though &amp; great judge and also &amp; great Sanskrit soboler, nowhere sbowa that he cared to see wbether fastrio rules allowed the apanaya nk of a man himself at any ago wbaterer (after some penance ). If he had seen those rules he would not beve unjustly taken to task pandits that flourished two bundred yoars beforo him and attributed irregular motives to them. It does not appear that ho mado any Boarob in the arobives of the Udaipur Durbar to see bow Shivaji traced his descent from the Sisodia clan, nor does it appear tbat he ovon went to Madbol add other places in Mabardptra whero apcient Maratha families have been holding sway for conturios.

<p>Ksatriyas and Kaliyuga</p>

<p>Kalāpagrāma, are endowed with great yogio powers, will revive the ksatriya race when the kita age will start again after the present kali age comes to an end and that some ksatriyas exist on the earth like seed even in the kali age. Vāyu(vol. I. 32.39-40), Matsya ( 273, 56-58) have similar verges. Relying on suoh pagsages somo medieval writers stated that there were no ksatriyas in their times. The Suddhitattyao23&amp; of Raghunandana (p. 268) after quoting the Viṣnupurāpa IV. 23. 4 and Manu X. 43 declares that kṣatriyas existed till Mahānandi, that the so-called ksatriyas of his day were sūdras and that similarly there were no yaibyas also. In the Sūdra-Kamalakara occurs this verse &lsquo;The varpas are brāhmaṇas, ksatriyas, vaisyas and sūdras, the first three being twice-bord; all these exist in the several yugas; but in the kali age only the first and the last remain&rsquo;. Nāgesabhatta (first half of 18th century 9236) in his Vrāty atāprāyasoittanirnaya ( Chaukbamba Series ) examines all the relevant Purāpa passages and states as his conclusion that real kṣatriyas do not exist and so those, in whose families no upanayana had been performed for ten or twenty generations, are not kṣatriyas even though they rule over kingdoms and no upanayana can be performed for such kinga. It must be stated that suob views, though held by some rigidly orthodox writers of extreme views, were not shared by most writers. All the smrtis speak of the duties of the four varnas even in the kali age. Parāśara-smrti which is said to be the smrti par excellence for the kali age ( as stated in I. 24 ) does 60. Almost all nibandham kāras (authors of digests and comipentaries ) discuss the privileges and duties of all varṇas. The author of the Mitāk ṣarā, who is rightly described as the best of all nibandba. kāras, nowhere says that kṣatriyas do not exist in the kali age. Numerous kings claimed to be descended from the Sun and the Moon. Hemādri in bis Caturvargacintāmani states that his patron&rdquo; was a scion of Somāvamsa ( vide H. Dh. pol. I p. 356 for quotations). The princes of Rajputana and Central India claimed to have sprung from the Agnikupda on Mount Abu, viz. of the</p>

<p>This question is now largely of academio interest. Whether &amp; person is a sūdra or a member of the regenerate classes assu mes great importance in adoption, inheritance and succession, Therefore the question, whether kṣatriyas exist in modern times, oame before the British Indian courts over a hundred years ago. In Chouturya Run Murdun Syn v. Sahub Purhulad Syn 7 Moore&rsquo;s Indian Appeals 18 this question was argued and the Privy Council citing the authorities on both sides set the question at rest by remarking (p. 46 ) &lsquo;Their Lordships have nevertheless no doubt that the existence of the Khatri caste as one of the regenerate tribes is fully recognised throughout India and also that Rajputs in central India&hellip;&hellip;are considered to be of that class &hellip; &hellip; The courts in all oases assume that the four great olasses remain&rsquo;. The only question that is now permissible is whether a particular caste belongs to the regenerate classes or to the sūdra class. On this the courts often differ. Vide p. 75 under Kayastha. In Maharaja of Kohapur v. Sundaram Ayyar 48 Mad. 1 it was held (in an exhaustive judgment extending over 229 pages) that the Tanjore Maratha princes descended from</p>
<p>Venkaji, the step-brother of the founder of the Maratha Empire, were sūdras and not kṣatriyas. The learned judges (at p. 51) quote Telang&rsquo;s dictum criticized by me above (note 923 ), but refrain from expressing any decided opinion about the claim of Shivaji to be of kṣatriya descent. In Subrao v Radha 52 Bom. 497 it was held after a careful examination of autho. rities that the Marathas of Mabārāstra are sub-divided into three groups, viz. (1) the five families, (2) the ninety-six families and (3) the rest and that the first two groups are kṣatriyas. It was further held that the tests to be applied in determining the class (varna) of a particular caste are three viz. the consoiousness of the caste itself, the acceptance of that con sciousness by other castes, and lastly its customs and usages,</p>

<p>das, Mātibas, that were described as dasyus by the Ait. Br.. One word that is of striking importance is mlecche. The Sat. Br. (III. 2. 1. 23–24, S. B. E. vol. 26 p. 32 ) states that the asuras were defeated because they spoke an incorrect and corrupt dialect and that a brāhmaṇa should not, therefore, utter suoh a corrupt®234 speech and so should not become a mleccha and an asura. Gaut. IX 17 enjoins that one should not speak with mlecohas, impure or irreligious persons and Haradatta explains that mlecchas are the inhabitants of Ceylon and similar countries where there is no system of varpas and āśramas. Viṣnu Dh. S. 64. 15 is to the same effect. Viṣnu Dh. S. 84. 1-% and Saṅkha 14.30 prescribe that one should not perform śrāddba in a mlecoha country nor should one visit such a country (except on &amp; pilgrimage ). Viṣṇu Dh. S. 84. 4 states that that country where the system of the four varnas is not in vogue is mlecoha terri tory and Aryāvarta is beyond it, while Manu II. 23 states that the mlecche country is beyond Aryāvarta which land is fit for sacrifices and in which the black deer wanders naturally. Visva rūpa on Yāj. I. 15 quotes Bharadvāja to the effect' one should not study the language of the mlecohas, for it is declared (in the Brāhmaṇas) that a corrupt word is indeed mleccha'. Vas. Dh. S. VI. 41 also enjoins that one should not learn the mlecoha dialect. Manu X. 43-44 knew that many of the tribes called Puṇdrakas, Yavanas, Sakas spoke mlecche languages and also the language of the Aryas (mleochavācas-cāryavioaḥ sarva te dasyavaḥ smrtāḥ ). In Parāśara IX. 36 mleochas are referred to as eaters of cow&rsquo;s flesh. That the molecohas had affected the Sanskrit language by lending to it certain words follows from the discussion in Jaimnini I. 3. 10 whether words like pika (a ouckoo ), nema (half), Bata (&amp; wooden vessel), tāmarasa (a red lotus) are to be understood in the sense in which mlecchas use them or certain meanings are to be assigned to them by deriving them from some root aocording to the rules of grammar, Nirukta and Nighantu and Jaimini&rsquo;s conclusion is that they are to be understood in the same sense in which mleochas employ them 3d Pāṇini derives the word yavanani</p>

<p>and Patanjali speaks of the siege of Saketa and Madhyamika by the Yavana by whom scholars generally understand Menander. Asoka in his Rook Ediot No. 13 refers to Yona kings and it appears from his reference that brāhmaṇas and bramaṇas were not found in the Yona country. A Yavanarāja Tusaspha is mentioned as the governor of Kathiawar under Aśoka in the inscription of Rudradāman at Junagadh ( E.I. vol. VIII. at p. 43). In the Prakrit Inscriptions the Yavanas are referred to as Yavana ( vide E, I. vol. VII. pp. 53-55 at Karle No. 7 and 10) or Yona or Yonaka (E. I. VIII. 90 Nasik cave No. 18). In Kharavela&rsquo;s inscription also the form is Yavana (E. I. 20 p. 79). In the Mahābhārata the words Yavana and Saka ocour very frequently. Vide notes above on these words. In the Dronaparya 119. 45-46 Yavana, Kamboja, Saka, Sabara, Kirāta and Barbara are mentioned as one group fighting against Satyaki. In Drona 119. 47-48 they are referred to as dasyus and as having long and flowing beards. In the Striparva 22. 11 Jayadratha is said to have had Kamboja and Yavana women in his harem. The word Yavana is generally taken as referring to the Greeks. But there are dissenting voices also. Dr. Otto Stein in Indian Culture' denies that the word ever means Greeks and Dr. Tarn in his recent work on</p>
<p>• Greeks in Bactria and India' p. 254 argues that the Yavanas in the Nasik inscriptions were not Greeks but only Indian citizens of a Greek polis. The Santiparva 65. 17-22 prescribes for Yavanas, Sakas and similar tribes only the duties of obedience to parents and attendance on teachers and tending cattle and looking after agriculture, dedication of wells and making gifts to dvijas, ahimsā, satya, absence of fury, sauca, adroha, maintenance of wife and child. Atri VII. 2 puts the receiving of gifts from or eating the food of or having sexual intercourse with the women of Sakas, Yavanas, Kambojas, Bahlikas, Khaśas, Dravidas on the same level with doing the same things with reference to nata, nartaka, svapāka &amp;o. Aparārka p. 923 quotes Vṛddha-Yājāavalkya to the effect that the touch of Mlecohas is on the same level with that of capdala, Bbilla and Parasika.</p>
<p>Prof. D. R. Bhandarkar in a very learned and scholarly paper in Indian Antiquary vol. 40 pp. 7-37 endeavours to establish that many non-Aryan persons belonging to tribes like the Yavanas, the Sakas became absorbed in the general mass of Hindu society, that even several of the princely families such as those of the Guhilots were not of pure Aryan descent and that the pride of</p>

<p>the purity of oaste shown by many castes is not justified by history. He, therefore, appeals to modern Indians to forget all caste-exclusiveness and pride. But this appeal will be in vain. Merely showing that non-Aryan elements were absorbed in the body of the Aryan community several thousands or hundreds of years ago will not probably lessen that pride. Such people may retort that, whatever may have happened centuries ago, for about a thousand years there has been no such fusion. There fore the appeal should rather be based on the futility of caste exclusiveness in the 20th century when owing to the exigenoles of the times any one can pursue any occupation, when a sense of one nation and one people is absolutely necessary for secur ing to Indians their proper place in the society of nations.</p>
<p>The question of the re-conversion or re-entry of people con. verted to other faiths willingly or against their wishes will be briefly dealt with immediately below.</p>
<p>A few words may first be said about the Vrātyastoma. The Tāṇdya-Mabābrāhmaṇa (or the Panca-vimsa, as it is called from the number of Adhyāyas) describes four yratyastomas in chap. 17. 1-4 (khandas). The meaning of many words and passages in that chapter of the brāhmaṇa is uncertain and some what cryptio. The four vrātyastomas were ekāhas (i. e. sacrifices taking one day only ). Tāṇdya 17. 1. 1 begins with the story that when the gods went to the heavenly world some dependents of theirs who lived the vrūlya life were left behind on the earth. Then through the favour of the gods the dependents got at the hands of Maruts the Sodaśastoma (containing 16 stotras ) and the metre (viz, anuṣtubh ) and then the dependents secured heaven. The Sodaśastoma is employed in each of the four vrātyastomas, the first of which ( 17. 1) is meant for all vrātyas, the 2nd is meant for those who are abhijasta ( who are wicked or guilty of heavy sins and 80 censured) and lead a vrāty&amp; life, the third for those who are youngest and lead &amp; vrātya life, and the fourth who are very old and yet lead a vrātya life. Some of the passages convey a tolerably clear idea of what the vrātyas were like. Those who $4 lead the vrātya life are base and are reduced to a baser stato, since they do not observe student-hood (brabmacarya) nor do they till the soil nor engage in trade. It is by the Sodasastoma that they</p>

<p>can attain this ( superior status ). This shows that the vrātyas did not perform upanayana and did not study the Veda, nor did they do even what vaidyas do. Another passage says those swallow poison who eat food of the common people as food fit for brāhmaṇas, who call good words bad, who strike with a stick him who does not deserve to be beaten (or punished ), who, though not initiated, speak the speech of the initiated. The Sodasastoma has the power to remove the guilt of these. That ( in this rite ) there are four Şodaśastomas, thereby they are freed from guilt. 925 This passage indicates that the vrātyas spoke the same language as the orthodox people, but were rough in their ways and lax as regards the food they partook of. They were thus outside the pale of orthodox Aryan society and they were brought within it by the Vrātyastoma described in the Tandya. The origin of the word vrātya is lost in the mists of antiquity. The 15th Kanda of the Atharvaveda glorifies the vrātya and identifies him with the Creator and Supreme Being. The word is probably derived from vrāta ( group) and means &ldquo;he who belongs to or moves in a group.' It is possible to derive the word from vrata. Originally vrātyas appear to have been groups of people who spoke the same language as orthodox aryas, but did not follow their discipline and habite. The word vrata oocurs in Rg. I. 163. 8, III. 26. 6, V.53. 11. Sāyaṇa also perceived the difficulty raised by the glorification of the yrātya in the Atharva voda 15. 1. 1 and his note is interesting, since he says that the description does not apply to all vrātyas, but only to some very powerful, universally respected and holy vrāty&amp; who was, however, not in the good books of the brāhmaṇas that were solely devoted to their own rites and sacrifices. Katyayanaśrauta XXII. 4. 1-28 and Āp. Srauta XXII. 5. 4-14 also deal with Vrātyastoma. Kātyāyana des cribes the four vrāty astomas and adds $28 &lsquo;by performing the vrātyastoma sacrifice, they should cease to be vrātyas and become eligible for social intercourse with the orthodox aryas.&rsquo; The Par, gr.

<p>In the Vrātyatā-suddbisamgraba provision is made 988 for the purification of vrātyas even after twelve generations (vide pp. 7 and 22-24 ) and that work adds (p. 42 ) that the Vrātya stoma like the penance for an avakirṇin is to be performed in tbe ordinary fire (laukiks agni). It also suggests easy substi tutes for the lengthy and trying penance of twelve years prescribed by Ap.</p>
<p>Hinduism has not been an avowedly proselytizing reli gion. In theory it could not be so. For about two thousand years the caste system has reigned supreme and no one can in theory be admitted to the Hindu fold who is not born in it. A Hindu may lose caste, be excommunicated and driven out of the fold of Hinduism, if he be guilty of very serious lapses and refuses to undergo the prāyasoittas prescribed by the smrtis. Gaut, 20.15 states that he who was guilty of a misdeed for which death was prescribed as a penance became purified only by dying. But Gaut, himself prescribed death ( 21.7 ) as penance only for the sins of brahmana-murder, drinking spiri tuous liquor and incest. Even as regards these three, lesser penances were prescribed by some smrtig as alternatives (e. g. vide Manu XI. 72, 74-8, 92, 108). When the sinner performed the prayascitta prescribed by the sāstras, he was to be welcomed by his relatives, who took a bath along with him in a holy river or the like and throw therein an unused jar filled with water; they were not to find fault with him and were to completely Associate with him in all ways (Manu XI. 186-187, Yāj. III. 295, Vas. 15, 20, Gaut. 20. 10-14). Vas. 15. 17 says that those who were patita were to be re-admitted to all social</p>

<p>intercourse when they performed the prescribed penances (patitānam tu caritavratānim pratyuddhāraḥ ). But if the sinner refused to undergo the prescribed prayascitta, then a peculiar procedure called gbatasphota (breaking a jar ) was prescribed. In such &amp; case the sinner&rsquo;s relatives ( sapiṇdas) made a slave girl whose face was turned to the south thrust aside with her foot an earthen jar full of water so that all water flowed out of it, then the relatives were to observe mourning for one day and night ( as he was deemed to be dead to them) and from that day they were to stop speaking or sitting with him, and all other social interoourse and he was to be given no inberitance ( vide Manu XI. 183-185, Yaj. III. 294, Gaut. 20, 2-7). In this way the obstinate sinner went out of the Hindu fold. The ancient smrtis do not expressly prescribe any rites for bringing into the brahmanic or Hindu fold a person who or whose ancestors did not belong to it. But as Hinduism has been extremely tolerantl8a (barring a few exceptional instances) it had a wonderful power of quiet and unobtrusive absorption. If &amp; person, though of foreign ancestry, conformed to Hindu social usages in outward behaviour, in course of time his descendants became absorbed into the vast Hindu community,</p>

<li>A fow striking instances of roligious toleranco among kings and common people may be cited with advantage, The Pala king Mabipala I granted a village to a brūhmaga of the Vajag.noyaśêkha in honour of Lord Buddha (E. I. vol. 14 p. 324). Similarly the king Subhakaradeva who was a great devotee of Buddba (para madaugata) granted two villages to 200 brohmapas ( Neul pur grant in E, I. vol. 15 p. 1); vide also E. I. vol. 15 p. 293. The famous Einporor Harpa, whose father was a great dovotee of the Sun, and who was himself a great devotoo of siva, pays the higbost bonour to his older brother Rajyavardhana who was a very devout Buddhist (paramagaugata ). Vide the Madhuban copperplate Inscription in E. I, vol. I. p. 67 and E. I, vol. VII. p. 155. Upavadata makes largo gifts to brahmanas as well as to communities of Buddhist monka (vide Nasik Inscriptions No. 10 and No. 12 in E.I. vol. VIII p. 78 and p. 82). The Valabhi king Gubasena:who was himself a Mahespara (Saiva ) made a grant of four villages to a bhiksu-sanghe. From the Paharpur plate of the Gupta yo&amp;r 159 (478-79 A.

<p>Absorption of non-Aryans</p>
<p>389</p>
<p>This process has gone on for at least two thousand years. The beginnings of it are found in the Santiparva obap, 65 where Indra tells the Emperor Māndhātr to bring all foreign people like the Yavanas under brahmanioal influence. The Besnagar column inscription shows that the Yona (yavana ) Heliodora ( Heliodorus) son of Diya (Dion) was a bhagavata ( devotee of Vasudeva ). Vide J. R. A. S. for 1909 pp. 1053 and 1087 and J. B. B. R. A. S. vol. 23 p. 104. In the caves at Nasik, Karlo and other places' many of the donors are said to have been yavanas (vide E. I. vol. VII, pp. 53-54, 55, E. I. vol. VIII, p. 90, E. I. vol. XVIII, p. 325 ). Several inscriptions state that Indian kings married Hūṇa prinoesses, e. g. Allata of the Gubila dynasty married a Hūna princess named Hariyadevi (I. A. vol. 39 p. 191 ), king Yaśaḥkarnadeva of the Kalacuri dynasty is said to have been the son of Karnadeva and Avalla devi, a Hūna princess. These and similar examples show that persons of foreign descent and their children were absorbed into the Hindu community from time to time. This absorption is illustrated in modern times by the case of Fanindra Deb v. Rajeshwar (L. R. 12 I. A. 72) in which it was found that a family in Kooch Behar not originally Hindu had adopted certain Hindu usages and it was held that it had not taken over the practice of adoption. How Hindu customs and incidents persist even after conversion to Islam is strikingly shown by the Khojas and Kutchi Memons of the Bombay Presi. dency, who though made converts to Islam several centuries ago, were held by the courts in India to have retained the ancient Hindu Law of succession and inheritance. 988b</p>
<p>The problem of taking back into the Hindu fold persons who were forcibly converted to other faiths has engaged the attention of smrtis. Moslems first attacked India in the 8th century from the direction of the province of Sindh. This invasion led to the enslavement and forcible conversion of many people. It appears that Devala and other smrtikāras tackled with the problem of taking back such people. The DeFala smrti opens with a question by the sages put to Devala who was sitting on the banks of the Sindhu at ease as to how</p>

By Aot XXVI of 1937 it is declared that the personal law will apply to all Muslims instead of customary law on going through cortain procodure prescribed by the Act.</p>

<p>brābmaṇas and members of the other varpas when carried off by Mlecchas were to be purified and restored to caste. The following verses of the Devala-smṛti are very instructive on this point. Verses 7-10 declare that when a brābmaṇa is carried off by Mlecchas and he eats or drinks forbidden food or drink or bas sexual intercourse with women he should not have approached, he becomes purified by doing the penanoe of cāndrāyana and parūka, that a kṣatriya becomes pure by under. going parāka and pādakṛcchra, &amp; vaibya by half of parāka and a sūdra by the penance of parāka for five days. Then verses 17-22 are most important *884 When persons are forci bly made slaves by Mleochas, cāndalas and robbers, are com pelled to do dirty aots, such as killing cows and other animals or sweeping the leavings of the food (of Mlecches) or eating the leavings of the food of Mlecohas or partaking of the flesh of anges, camels and village pigs, or baving intercourse with their women, or are forced to dine with them, then the penance for puri. fying a dvijāti that has stayed for a month in this way is pra jāpatya, for one who had conseorated Vedio fires (and stayed one month or less ) it is cāndrāyaṇa or parāka; for one who stays a year (with Mlecchas in this condition of things ) it is both cāndrāyana and parāka ; &amp; sūdra who stays (in this con dition) for a month becomes pure by kroobrapāda; a sūdra who stays a year should drink yayaka for half a month. The appropriate prāgaścitta should be determined by learned brāh maṇas when a person has stayed (in the above circumstances among Mlecohas) for over a year; in four years the person (who stays in the above circumstances among Mlecobas) is reduced to their condition (i. e. becomes &amp; mleocha and there</p>

<p>is no prāya citta for him)!' The Prayasoittaviveka states that after four years death is the only purifier for him.9284 Three more verses of Davala (53-55 ) also deserve considera tion &lsquo;One who was forcibly seized by Mlecchas for five, six or seven years or from ten to twenty years, is purified by under going two Prājāpatyas. Beyond this there is no purification ; these penances are meant only for him who has simply stayed among Mlecohas. He who had stayed with Mlecohas from five to twenty years is purified by undergoing two Candrāyaṇas&rsquo;. These verses are apparently inconsistent with the verses cited above ( 17-22 ), but they most probably mean this that if a man only stayed among Mlecchas for 5 to 20 years, but has not done any of the forbidden things such as eating uochista or the flesh of asses &amp;c., then he can be taken back even after so many years. This would be an exception to the rule contained in verse 22. There is no reason why the reason ing of Devala should not be extended to persons who have been in the condition stated in verses 17-22 for over four years. In the Pancadasi (Trptidipa v. 239) we have the following very significant passage**8* just as &amp; brāhmaṇa seized by Mlecches and afterwards undergoing the appropriate prāyascitta does not become confounded with Mlecchas ( but returns to his original status of being a brāhmana) so the Intelligent Soul is not really to be confounded with the body and other material adjuncte.&rdquo; This establishes that the great Vidyaranya, who after Samkarı cārya, is the greatest figure among ācāryas, approved of the view that a brābmana even though enslaved by Mlecchas could be restored to his original status.</p>
<p>Under Shivaji and the Peshwas it appears that several persons that had been forcibly made Moslems were restored to caste after under-going prāyasoitta (vide notes 2321-2 below for examples ). But this was done in only a few instances.</p>
<p>In modern times there is a movement among Hindus called fuddhi or patitaparāvartana (purification or bringing back into the Hindu fold those who had fallen away from it). In a very few cases persons born in western countries have been taken into the Hindu fold by the performance of vrātyastoma</p>

<p>and other rites. But such instances are very rare and are not yet supported by the vast majority of Hindus. It has been shown above that for taking back a man who was once a Hindu but had left Hinduism, there is empti authority in Devala and others and the authority of the Nibandhakāras.</p>
<p>Punarupanayana (performing upanayana again ).</p>
<p>In certain cases an upanayana has to be performed again. The A$v. *** gr. (1. 22. 22-26 ) presoribes that in punarupadayana the cutting of the hair and production of intelligence (medhā janana ) are optional, there are no rules about paridana (giving in charge of deities ) and about the time ( i.e. it may be performed at any time and no paridāna is necessary) and instead of the usual Gayatri, he should recite &lsquo;tat savitur Vğạimahe ' (Rg. V. 82. 1. ). When &amp; person in whose family one Veda is studied ( 0.g. the Roveda ) wants to study another Veda (e. g. Yajurveda ), he had to undergo a fresh upanayana. The Asv. gr. sutra is interpreted in this way by some. Hara datta on Ap. Dh. S. I. 1. 1. 10 says that as the Sāvitri (i, e. Gāyatri, Rg. III. 62. 10 ) is recited for all Vedas according to the Brābmana passage quoted by Ap. one upanayana is sufficient for the study of the three Vedas in succeesion, but if a person wants to study the Atharvaveda after studying another Veda, then a fresh upanayana is necessary. This is one kind of punarupanayana. Another kind of punarupanayana takes place when in the first upanayana the principal rite viz. placing his hands on the boy&rsquo;s shoulders and bringing the student near the teacher is left off through oversight or the first upanayana takes place in a season other than rasanta (spring) or in the dark half of a month or on a day which was anadhyāya 980 (unfit for Vedic study ) or on a galagraha (vide note 642 above) or in the latter part of the day. A tbird kind of punar upanayana is one which is by way of prāyascitta for certain sins or lapges from good conduct.31 Gaut. 23. 2-5</p>

<p>prescribes the penance called Taptakrochra and punarupanayana for one guilty of drinking wine (sura ) in ignorance or partaking of human urine, fæces and semen and the flesh of wild beasta, camels, asses, village cocks, and village hoge. Vas. ( 23. 30 ) also has a similar sutra. Baud. Dh. S. II, 1, 25 quotes &amp; verse if a person belonging to the three varṇas unknowingly drinks surā ( wine ) or fæces, he has to undergo punarupanayana&rsquo; and says ( II. 1. 29 ) that if a brabmacari carries a corpse ( other than that of his parents or teacher ) he has to undergo punar upanayana. Manu V. 91 and Viṣnu Dh. 8. 22. 86 prescribe the same. In the Baud. gr. paribhāṣāsūtra (1. 12.4-6) it is said that on partaking of honey, or flesh, srāddha food or food from those in impurity on birth, or the milk of a cow before the lapse of ten days or the milk of a sandhini cow, mushrooms or the resin exuded from trees, wilayana (8 product of milk?), the food prepared for a number of people in common or the food of prostitutes, &amp; man has to undergo punarupanayana and, according to some, also if he goes to &amp; forbidden coun try, $32 viz. Saurāstra (Kathiawar), Sindhu, and Sauvira (Sind and the territory to its south and east), Avanti ( Ujjain), Dakṣiṇāpatha ( Deccan), a brāhmaṇa has to undergo punarupanayapa (except when he goes on a pilgrimage). It then sets out the procedure ( such as &amp; homa, putting a fuel stick of palaśa on the fire and oblations of cooked food and ajga) and adds that in punarupanayana shaving, dakṣiṇā, girdle, staff, deer-skin, begging for food and vratas do not take place.</p>
<p>The Vaik. smārta (VI. 9-10) contains similar rules for punkrupanayana.838 Aparārka (p. 1160 ) quotes Paitbinasi to the effect that if a grown-up person drinks the milk of sheep or of a she-ass, she.camel or of a woman, he has to undergo punarupangyang and also the penance called prājāpatya.</p>

<p>It appears that from very early times Vedic studies wero stopped on various grounds. The Tai, Ār. 934 II. 15 has a very important statement on this subject. &lsquo;Indeed as to this yajña (brahmayajña ) there are two cases in which the study of the Veda ceases, namely, when the man hintself is impure or when the place is impure&rsquo;. The Sat. Br. 935 has a passage in which several oocasions when Vedio study was ordinarily stopped are mentioned and it is added that those occasions do not provent the repetition of Vedic texts as Brahmayajña. &ldquo;Therefore one knowing this should certainly repeat the Veda as Brahmayajña, when the wind blows, when lightning flashes, when it thunders or when there is a fall of thunderbolt, in order that yaṣatkūras may not be fruitless'. The Āp. Dh. 8. (I. 4. 12. 3. ) quotes the Vajasaneyi Brahmana ( the Satapatha ) to the effect that &quot; Vedio study is Brahmayajña; .when it thunders, when lightning flashes, when there is a fall of the thunderbolt, when the wind blows, these are its vasatkāras ; 936 therefore when&hellip;&hellip;fruitless&rdquo;. The Ait. Ār. (V.3.3) notes that if there be rain when it is not the season of rainfall, he should make a break by observing Cessation of Vedic study for three nights. 887</p>
<p>The subject of anadhyāya is discussed in the grhya and dharmasūtras and in almost all smṛtis. It is not possible to give for want of space the differences between the several works. Among sutras and smṛtis the most exhaustive and lengthy treat ment is found in Āp. Db. 8. (I. 3. 9, 4. to I. 3.11 ), Gaut. 16. 5-49, Saṅkhāyana gļ. IV. 7 (S. B.

<p>Among tithis the following are anadhyāyas. On the first, the 8th, the 14th, 15thtithis ( Paurṇamāsi and Amāvāsya ) there was to be cessation of Vedic Study for the whole day ; vide Manu IV. 113-114, Yāj I. 146 ( in both pratipud is not expressly mentioned ) and Hārita. Patanjali in the Maha bhāsya ( vol. II. p. 386 ) refers to anadbyāya on amāvāsya and 14th tithi. There is a famous verse of the Rāmāyana 888 which shows that pratipad also was a holiday. Gaut. says that there was no holiday on the full moon days of the twelve months, but only on the full moon days of Āsādha, Kartika and Phālguna. The Baud. Dh, S. I. 11. 42-43 quotes &amp; verse 989</p>

Aparārka 940 (p. 189 ) quotes from the Nṛsimhapurāṇa verses to the effect that tbere is to be no teaching of the Veda ) on Mabānavami (9th of Aśvina, bright half), on Bharani (i. e. the tithi when the moon is in Bharani nakṣatra after Bhadram pada full moon ), Akṣatatștiya (3rd of Vajśākha, bright half ) and Rathasaptami ( 7th of Māgha, bright half ). Similarly there is to be anadhyaya on what are called Yugādi and Man. vantarādi tithis, Yugādi tithis according to Viṣnupurāṇa $1 and Brahmapurāṇa quoted by Aparārka ( p. 425) are Vaisakha śukla trtlya, Kārtika sukla navami, Bbādrapada kṛṣṇa trayodasi and Māgha Purnimā ( they are respectively the beginnings of the four yugas, kṣta, tretā, dvāpara and kali).

<p>days in the year when the day and night are equal), on the tithis when Viṣpu sleeps and awakes from sleep ( i. e. Aṣadha sukla-ekādasi and Kārtika-sukla-ekādasi ), on Yugādi and Manvādi tithis there is anadhyāya. The tithis on which the fourteen manvantaras are supposed to begin are quoted below. 948 According to &amp; purāṇa passage quoted in the Sm. O. (I. p. 58 ) there is anadhyāya on Sopapadā tith is $8 (viz. Jyeṣtha sukla %, Asvina sukla 10, and Māgha sukla 4 and 12). Sometimes on the same day there are two tithis; hence the rule laid down is that if on any day a particular tithi ( which is declared to be anadhyāya) is shown in the calendar as extending for three muhūrtas at sunrise or at sunset, then the whole of that day is anadhyāya. ***</p>
<p>Yaj. (I. 148-151 ) speaks of 37 talkālika anadhyāyas ( i. c. where Veda study is suspended only as long as the occasion or disturbance stated lasts). They are: when there is noise created by a dog, jackal, ass, owl, singing of sūman, playing on a flute and the cries of the distressed (these are 7); in the vioinity or presence of impure things, of a corpse, or a sūdra or antya (i. e. one of the untouchables ), cemetery, a patita (one guilty of mabāpātaka ); when the place ( of study ) has become impure or when the man himself is impure; when there is continuous flashing of lightning or continuous peals of thunder; while one&rsquo;s hands are wet after taking one&rsquo;s meals; in the midst of water, at midnight; when a violent wind is blowing; when there is a rainfall of dust, when the quarters are lit up by sudden (and strange ) lights ; at the two twilights; when there is fog; when there is a fright (caused by robbers &amp;c.); when one is running; when the smell of something rotten or impure spreads ; when a distinguished visitor comes to the house; when one rides an ass, &amp; camel, a conveyance (like a chariot ), an elephant, &amp; horse, a boat, or climbs &amp; tree or is in a desert (or barren) place.

<p>be added. According to Ap. Dh. S. L 3. 10. 19 when wolves howl, or when there is the sound of any musical instrument, or of weeping, singing or of the recitation of a Sāman there is anadhyāya. Gaut. 16.7 mentions the sound of bāṇa (a kind of viṇā ), bber! (a drum), mṭdanga, garta (&amp; chariot ) and the distressed. Manu (IV. 123-124) explains that when A sāman is heard, one should not study any portion of the Roveda or Yajurveda, because the gods are the devatās of Rgveda, the Yajurveda deals with men ( it enjoins actions to be done by men), Sāmaveda has the pitrs as its deities; hence its sound has sonething of the impure or uncanny about it. Āp. Dh. S. I. 3. 11. 27 prescribes 94% that there should be no Vedio study as long as there are clouds when it is not the season for clouds, when there is a halo round the sun or moon, when there is a rainbow, or when there is parhelion or a star with a tail (like &amp; fish). Gaut. 16. 19, Āp. Db. I. 3. 9. 14-15, Vas. 13. 11 say that there is anadhyāy&amp; as long as a corpse or a cāṇdāls is in the village or town. Gaut. 16, 45 states the view of some that the Veda can never be studied in a city ; there is no Veda study as long as there is an assembly of people ( Manu IV. 108 ) or while the student is lying down or has stretched his feet or placed them on a cot or stool, or while he sits on his haunches winding round his knees and hips a piece of cloth (Manu IV. 112., Vas. Dh. S. 13. 23, Viṣnu Dh. S. 30. 17). There is to be anadbyaya when one is answering the calls of nature ( Manu IV. 109), or when one has not yet sipped water (acamana ) after taking food, or after partaking of meat ( Manu IV. 112), wlien there is wordy argument or there is an affray or &amp; fight or when one is wounded or when blood flows from the body ( Manu IV. 122 ) or when one suffers from indigestion or vomits or has sour eruotations ( Manu IV. 121 ).</p>
<p>In certain cases anadhyāya lasts only for a portion of the day. When the wind blows by day strong enough to carry off clouds of dust (Gaut. 16. 5) there is anadbyāya during the day (but not at night even if the wind is still strong ) or when on a festive occasion like upanayana there is anadhyāya after dinner that day (Gaut. 16. 43 ); when in the morning twilight fire has been kindled for hona and there are</p>

Db. 8. I. 3. -11. 28 ) or whon there is the howling of Bālāvska (hyaena ?) or &amp; jackal moving about alone there is Anadhyāya till one gets up from sleep ( ibid I. 3. 11.29 ).</p>
<p>In some cases there is anadhyāya for the whole day and night. According to Yāj. I. 145-147 there is such an anadhyaya when there is thunder at the twilight time, there is a fall of the thunderbolt or earth-quake or the fall of a meteor, when one finishes Samhita or Brābmaṇi ( of the sākhā one is studying ) or wbon one finishes the study of the Aranyaka portion of one&rsquo;s Veda; when there is an eclipse of the sun or moon, or when it is the firet day after the season changes or whon a person partakes of grāddha food or accepts a gift on srāddha (except in Ekoddista srāddha); when a beast, frog, mongoose, dog, snake, cat or mouse passes between the teacher and pupil ( Manu IV. 126 also ) or when the banner of Indra is raised or taken down. Manu IV. 110 lays down anadhyāya for three days when one accepts invitation for an Ekoddiṣta srāddha or when the king dies or when there is an eclipse. This last refers to an eclipso where the sun or the moon sets while still eclipsed. Gaut. 1.60 prescribes cessation for three days when dogs and others come between. This is explained as referring to the first lesson in Veda, while the words of Manu and Yāj. are held to refer to repetition. Raising the banner in honour of Indra was a festival prescribed for kings in the Kausika sūtra 140 and other works. The banner was raised usually in Bhadrapada (or sometimes in Asvina) on the 12th of the bright half when the moon was in conjunction with uttarāṣād bā, srayana or dhaniṣtha oonstellation and it was taken down in the same month on the bharani constellation ( vide Sm. C. I. p. 59 ). According to the Bșhat-Samhitā ( chap. 43 ) of Varaha this festival lasted from the 8th to the 12th day of Bhadrapada sukla. Manu (IV. 119) prescribes anadbyāya for a day and night on the Aṣtakā days &ldquo;46 and on the last day of each of tbe six stus ( seasons ).</p>

<p>In a few cases the anadhyāya was akalika 7 i. e. lasted for one day (60 ghatikās) from the time when the cause began to operate up to the same hour next day. Āp. Dh. S. ( I. 3. 11. 25-26) lays down this kind of anadhyāya if out of three viz, Hasbing of lightning, thunder and rain, one or two occur at a time when it is no season for rain; there is this anadhyāya for all vidyas at all times, when there is an eclipse of the sun or the inoon or there is an earthquake or a whirlwind or fall of meteors. Manu IV, 103-105 and Gautama 16. 22-23 are similar to Ap. Dh, S. 1. 3.11. 25-26 and Manu IV, 118 prescribes akalika anadbyāya when a village is thrown into confusion by thieves or there is a commotion due to &amp; conflagration and in the case of all portentous phenoinena (such as rain of blood or stones; vide Vas. 13. 35). Gaut, (16. 47-48 ) adds that the performer of a sraddha ( whether he actually serves cooked food to brāh. maṇas or only makes gifts of money and corn &amp;c.) has to observe this anadhyāya (vide Manu IV. 117 also).</p>
<p>Anadhyāya for three days was prescribed in a few cases. If lightning, thunder and rain all appear together when it is not the proper season for them, there is anadhyāya for three days (Ap. Dh. I. 3. 11. 23). Vide note 937 above. In the utsarga and upākarana of the Vedas, on the death of gurus ( persons worthy of respect like the father-in-law), on the Aṣtakās and on the death of near agnates (like brother, nephew &amp;c.) there is anadhyāya for three days 98 ( Ap. Dh. S. 1. 3. 10. 2-3). Gaut. (6.38-41 ) is similar to Āp. The Harita dharmasutra ®9 prescribes apadhyāya for three days on the death of one&rsquo;s upadhyāya, or of the king or of a śrotriya or fellow pupil, on eclipses of the sun and the moon, on the taking down of the banner of Indra and on the death of one&rsquo;s ācārya.</p>

<p>Manu (IV. 110 and 119 ) prescribes anadhyaya for three days on accepting invitation for eloddiṣtu śrūddha, on the death of the king, on eclipses and on upakarms or utsarga. Yaj. I. 144 contains similar rules.</p>
<p>Āp. Dh. 8. ( I. 3, 10, 4) prescribes 12 days' anadhyāya on the death of one&rsquo;s parents and ācārya. Baud. Dh. 8. I. 11. 32 prescribes 90 three days' anadhyāya on the death of one&rsquo;s father. This rule must be taken as referring only to a brahmacāri. Vas. (13. 39-40 ) prescribes three days' anadhyaya on the death of one&rsquo;s ācārya and one day&rsquo;s on the death of the son or wife of the acārya.</p>
<p>The Smrtyarthasāra (p. 10) mentions some occasions when apadhyaya may extend to a month, to six inonths, or a year. Ap. D. S. I. 3. 9. 1. prescribes that, when upakarma is performed on the full moon day of Srāvana, for a month thereafter ono should not study Veda in the first part of the night (he may do 80 after that at night or in the day ).</p>
<p>Aparārka (1). 192 ) quotes &amp; verse from Yamaoi that there can be po Vedio study under the shade of certain trees like Ślesmataka, Salmali ( silk-cotton), Madhuka, Kovidara and Kapitthake.</p>
<p>Both Gaut. (16. 49 ) and Ap. Dh. S, I. 3. 11. 34 state that besides the anadhyāyas expressly mentioned by them there are others which may be learnt from the several smrtis and from the assemblies of learned men.95%</p>
<p>It would be noticed how the number of anadhyāyas is rather too numerous for rapid and effective study. Therefore certain rules are laid down to explain what is that is forbidden on those days.</p>

<p>the Veda in the mind). Baud. Dh. S. 1.953 11, 40-41 says that the rule about anadhyāya on portentous happenings for a day and night does not apply to mānase study; but even mānase study is forbidden when there is impurity due to birth or death, Gaut. 16. 46 says the same. Ap. Dh. S. I. 3. 11. 20 allows (in general) mental study (not vocal) on unadhyāya days. Vide also Ap. Dh. S. I. 11. 32. 12-13.</p>
<p>The Āp. Srautasūtra &ldquo;54 ( 24. 1. 37) says that the rules about anadhyāya apply only to the learning of Vedic mantras but have no application to their employment in various rites, Jaimini $55 ( XII. 3. 18-19) establishes the proposition that the rules about anadhyāya being prescribed for acquisition of the Vedio mantras have no application to their employment in sacrifices. The Ap. Dh. 8. I. 4. 12. 9 has a sūtra which shows remarkable agreement with the words of Jaimini.</p>
<p>We saw above that according to the Tai, Ār, the rules of anadhyāya do not apply to the daily performance of Brahma yajña (i. e. to the repetition of the Vedic texts already learnt). Maou II. 105 says that there is no concern about anadhyāya as to the lores ( the anges like grammar, Nirukta &amp;o.) helpful to (understanding of) the Veda, the obligatory syadhyaya (i. 0. brahmayajña) and the mantras to be used in homa. Saunaka 958 quoted in the Sm, C. says there is no anadhyāya as to repeating the Vedic texts in the obligatory rites and in japa nor in kāmya rites, in sacrifices or in the pārāyapa (repeating the Veda already learnt); the anadhyāya rules apply only to the first learning of Vedio mantras and to their teaching. The Smrtyar thasāra 97 (p. 10 ) says that those who have a slippery memory or those who have to commit to memory extensive Vedic texts</p>

<p>should study the Vedāngas, nyāya (logio ), mimāṁsā and dharmaśāstras on all anadhyayas except on 1st, 8th, 14th and full moon and new moon days. Some digests quote a verse from the Kurmapurana958 that there is no anadhyāya for the study of Vedāngas, of itibāsa, purānas, dharmaśāstras and other sāstras ; but on parva days the study of even these should be dropped. This shows that these tithis were the only close holidays on which there was complete cessation of all study, whether Vedio or non-Vedio, That is, these were what are called nitya holidays while the rest are naimittika anadhyāyas. Even now these nitya anadhyāyas are observed by vaidikas and by Pandits in their Sanskrit schools ( particularly amāvāsyā).</p>
<p>It will be seen that though some of the occasions for anadhyāya are somewhat strange and bizarre, underlying most of them there are reasonable and understandable principles. Vedic study depended in the first place on memo rizing Committing sacred texts to memory (without in most Cases understanding their meaning ) required cloge attention and concentration. Therefore, all occasions which caused dis turbance or distraction of mind were held to be anadhyāyas. But the same concentration was not necessary for reciting in sacrifices or jape or brahma-yajña what had already been committed to memory. Hence such occasions were not anadhyāyas for those purposes.</p>
<p>It was believed that&rsquo;s if a person taugbt the Vedic lore or studied it on anadhyāya days, he incurred loss as to ( long ) life, offspring, cattle, intelligence and the merit accumulated by him,</p>
<p>Kesānta or godāna :-Tuis sainskāra consists in shaviug the head and also the hair on the other parts of the body ( such as arm-pits, chin). Pār. gr., Yaj.

<p>of a sacrifice ) the word godana is used in the sense of a portion of the hair (on the head) near the top of the ear. Most emptikāras say that this samskāra was performed in the 16th year. According to San. gs. (I. 28. 20, S. B. E. vol. 29, p. 57 ) it may be performed in the 16th or 18th year. According to Manu II. 65 kesānta is performed in the 16th, 22nd or 24th year respectively for a brābmana, kṣatriya or vaisya. The Laghu-Aśvalāyana smrti XIV. 1 says that Godāna may be performed in the 16th year or at the time of marriage. This last view seems to have been known to Bhavabhūti who in his Uttararāmacarita 36( Act. I) makes the heroine Sitā say that Rāma and his three brothers had the godāna ceremony per formed immediately before their marriage. It is somewhat strange that according to the Kausika būtra 868 (54. 15 ) godāna precedes cūdākarma and the commentator Kesaya remarks that godāna takes place at the end of the first or 2nd year ( from birth ).</p>
<p>There is great divergence of views about the starting point from which 16 years are to be calculated. The Baud. Dh. S. ( 1. 2.7 ) has stated the rule in general terms that the number of years is to be calculated from the time of conception.963 Following this rule the Mit. on Yāj. I. 36 and Kullūka on Man II. 65 say that godāna should be performed in the 16th year from conception in the case of brahmaṇas, &ldquo;4 while Aparārka says that it is to be performed in the 16th year from birth. Viśvarūpa 90% on Yāj. I. 36 says that whatever the period of brahmacarya that a student was going to observe ( whether 12, 24, 36, 48 &amp;c.) keśānta must be performed in the 16th year and if any one had his upanayana performed later than the 16th year, then kesānta will not take place at all.

<p>All sūtrakāras are agreed that godāne or keśānta follows the procedure of cūdākarana with a few differences. The Asv. gr. ( I. 18. 1-9 ) points these out. Caula is performed in the 3rd year, while godāna is performed in the 16th, Aśv. gr. further says &quot; wherever the word keśa occurs ( in the mantras or proce dure of caula ) he should employ the word smagru ( beard). He moistens the beard here. (The mantra is)&lsquo;purify his head and face, but do not deprive him of life. He gives orders ( to the barber ) * arrange his beard, the bair of his body and his nails, ending in the north&rsquo;. Having bathed and stood up silently during the rest of the day, he should break his silence in the presence of his teacher (saying to the teacher) &lsquo;I give a gift&rsquo;. The fee is a pair of COWB. Let the teacher instruct him to keep the observances for &amp; year&rdquo; 988 Nārāyana notes that being grown up he should not sit on his mother&rsquo;s lap as in caula (but sit to her right) and that the instruction is to be on the next day, Nārāyana says that the instruction referred to is the one men tioned in Āśv. gṛ. I. 22. 20 from &lsquo;cutting the hair to giving in charge&rsquo; i. e. from Aśv, gr. I. 19. 8. to I. 20.7. It is better to hold as Pār. and Bhār. gs. ordain that the instruction is as to brahmacaryavrata (mentioned $67 in Āsv. gr. I. 22. 17) or that he is not to shave himself for a year, 12 days, 6 days or at least 3 days. Par. gr., Śankhāyana and several others allowed the fee of only one cow 368. Gobbila ( III. 1. 5) and Khadira (II.5.3) allowed optionally the gift of a pair of horses or a pair of sheep for kṣatriyas or vaisyas respectively. According to</p>

<p>Gobhila and Khādira shaving the beard precedes a vrata called godānika for one year and both state at length the observances of that vrate (Gobhila III. 1. 11-29, Kbādira II. 5. 7-16).</p>
<p>Sāñ. gr. (I. 28. 22) expressly says that the keśānta ceremony is performed for girls but silently. Āp. gf. 16.15, Hir. gr. 6. 16, Bhāradyāja gr. I. 10, Baud. gr. III. 2. 55 prescribe in godāna the removal of all the hair on the head (including the sikhā top-knot), while in caula it is not so.</p>
<p>This samskāra gradually went out of vogue, so much so that most of the medieval digests like the Sm.C., the Samskārapraksa, and the Nirnayasindhu contain hardly anything about it.</p>
<p>Snāna or Samāvartana :-( Taking the ceremonial bath after finishing Vedic study and returning from the teacher&rsquo;s house). Some gūtrakāras such as Gaut. (VIII, 16), Ap. gr. XII. 1, Hir. gr. 9. 1 and Yāj. I. 51 employ the word &ldquo;snāna' for this eamskāra, while Ásv. gr. III. 8. 1, Baud. gp. (II. 6. 1), Āp. Dh. 8. I. 2. 7. 15 and 31, Bhār, gr. II. 18 employ the word samāvartana. The Khadira gr. (1. 3. 2-3, III. 1. 1) and Gobhila III. 4. 7 use the word &lsquo;āplavana&rsquo; (which means snāna ). Manu ( III, 4) uses both &lsquo;snāna&rsquo; and &lsquo;samavartana&rsquo; in &ldquo;a duija being permitted by his teacher, may take the ceremonial bath and return from his teacher according to the rules laid down (in his own gļhyasūtra ) and then marry a &amp; girl &amp;o&rdquo;. Aparārka ( p. 76 ) explains this verse by saying that it makes a distinction between enāna and samāvartana. The distinction consists in this : snana or ceremonial bath indicates the completion of the period of student-hood. A man who wants to remain a brahmacārin all his life need not undergo this samskāra. Samāvartana literally means &lsquo;return from the teacher&rsquo;s house to one&rsquo;s home&rsquo;. If a boy learns under his own father, then literally speaking there will be no return in his case from a teacher&rsquo;s house. Medhatithio' (on Manu III. 4) puts this position forcibly. Samā vartana is not a necessary anga ( adjunct ) of marriage and therefore he who learnt the Veda in his father&rsquo;s house may, though there is no return ( to the father&rsquo;s house from the teacher&rsquo;s house ), enter on matrimony. Some hold that Samāvartana is an anga of marriage and consists</p>

<p>in the ceremonial bath. If it be said that the gerundial termination (tva in snātvā in Manu III. 4 ) conveys distinotion between spāna and samāvartana, the reply is that Manu will later on speak of samāvartana as the samskāra of snāna.</p>
<p>Ap. gr. 12. 1 begins its treatment with the words &lsquo;vedam adhitya snāsyan&rsquo; (after learning the Veda and when about to undergo the ceremonial bath ).' Having these words in mind Baud. gr. 970 (II 6. 1) remarks that in the words &lsquo;vedam adbitya snāsyan&rsquo; it is samāvartana that has been described. Hence the essence of samāvartana is the ceremonial bath and return to the parental home is a subsidiary matter (which may or may not occur in the case of a student). The Mahabhasya (vol. I. p. 384) says that a person after he bas studied the Veda and taken the ceremonial bath with the permission of the teacher should begin to use a cot (for sleeping on).</p>
<p>In the Vedic Literature both words are used. In the Chandogya Upaniṣad 91 IV. 10. 1 we read that Upakosala Kamalāyana became a student of Satyakama Jābāla and tended his teacher&rsquo;s fires for twelve years; the teacher while making his other pupils return( to their parental home ) did not make Upako sala return. Here it is clear that the Upaniṣad knew the term *samāvartana'. Similarly in Chāndogya VIII, 15 it is stated that &lsquo;having studied the Veda according to the rules in the time that was left after doing work for the teacher and having returned from the teacher&rsquo;s house to his own family&rsquo;. On the other hand the Sat. Br. (XI. 3. 3. 7) says that one 974 should not beg after taking the ceremonial bath'. The Sat. Br. (XII. 1. 1. 10) distinguishes 078 &amp; snataka from &amp; brabmacārin (8. B, E. vol. 44 p. 137). Similarly the Āp. Dh. S. II. 6. 14. 13 quotes a Brāh. mana passage therefore the face of the snātaka is as if resplen dent with fire'. The Ait. Ār. V. 974 3. 3. remarks that one who</p>

<p>has not studied this (mabā vrata) does not become a (true) snataka, oven though he may have learnt a good deal else.' 10. ANS The Aśr. gr. III. 9. 8 summarises &amp; Brahman&amp; passage to the</p>
<p>Swiss effect that a snātaka is indeed a great being,</p>
<p>Snana (the ceremonial bath ) was ordained by the sūtrakāras after a student finishesd bis Vedic study. The Āśv. gp. (III.9.4) remarks “after having finished ( the task of learning) vidyā, they should invite his teacher to name the gift (of wealth or other wise) he desired or when the pupil has been permitted by the teacher, the pupil may take a ceremonial bath, 975 This shows that one may perform snāna either when he had finished his Vedic and other studies or he may do so even without finishing his intended studies, if the teacher permitted him to do so. The Pār. gr. II. 6 is more explicit The student should take the ceremonial bath after finisbing (the study of) the Veda or when he has gone through the period of student-bood for 48 years, or for 12 years according to some ( teachers); (he should) take the bath when permitted by the teacher,' A person who has taken the ceremonial bath is called a snūlaka. A snātaka is said by the Pār. 85. (II. 5),976 Gobbila (III. 5. 21-22), Baud. Er. paribhāṣā gūtra I. 15, Hārita and others to be of three kinds, viz vidyāsnātaka (or Veda-snātaka as Baud. gļ, pari. bhāṣā has it), vratasnātaka and vidyā-vratagnātaka (or veda vrata-snātaka as in Baud). One who has finished Veda study, but has not gone through the pratas ( described above ) is called vidyā-snātaka ; one who has finished the vratas, but has not finished his Veda study is styled vrata-snilalı ; while one who has finished both is named vidyd-vrata-snātaka. Yaj, I. 51 in saying that a student &lsquo;after finishing Veda (study) or the yratas ( observances of brabmacarya ) or both, and after giving to the teacher what the latter chooses to ask should take the ceremonial bath with the teacher&rsquo;s permission&rsquo; impliedly refers to the three-fold division of snātakes. These three alternatives are due to the fact that &amp; student may not have the ability or the time to go through the full Vedio curriculum and the</p>

<p>vratas. Medbātithi on Manu IV. 31 notices that according to some vrata-snātakas are those who without finishing Veda study take the ceremonial bath three years after upanayana. Gobbila ( III, 5. 23 ) says that of these, vidya-vrata-snātaka is the best, the other two being equal to each other. Āp. Dh. S. (I. 11. 30. 1-5 ) refers to this three-fold division and adds that all three are to be honoured as anātakas, but that great reward follows by honouring vidyd-vrata-snātakas.</p>
<p>A good deal of time may conceivably elapse between a man&rsquo;s taking the ceremonial bath and actually marrying &amp; woman. During that period he is called a snātaka; while after marriage he comes to be called a grhastha 977. As long as &amp; person is not married after he takes the bath, he has to follow the observances prescribed for snātakas and gļhasthas so far as applicable to his position but not those of a student. Gaut. 878 (IX. 1-2) makes the position quite olear by prescribing the same rules of conduct for gphasthas and for snātakas. He also states (in III. 9) that whatever rules laid down for brahma carins are not opposed to the special rules for other āśramas are to be observed by all. The latter means that the special obser vances of a brahmacārl are not applioable to bim (such as avoiding honey and flesh, living on alms, offering fuel-sticks to fire),</p>
<p>The most elaborate procedure of samāvartana is found in Hir. gr. I. 9-13, Baud, gr. paribhāṣā I. 14, Pār, gi, II. 6 and Gobbila gr. III. 4-5. A concise statement is given below from Āśv. gr. (III. 8 and 9). The student who is about to return home from his teacher should get ready (eleven) things, viz. a jewel (to be suspended round his neck), two earrings, &amp; pair of gar ments, an umbrella, a pair of shoes, a staff, a wreath, (powder) for rubbing his body with, ointinant, eye-salve, &amp; turban, ( all these ) being meant for the teacher and for himself. If he cannot afford to have these materials for both of them, then he</p>

Having placed the fuel-stick on high (not on the ground ) and having made gifts of food and of a cow to brāhmaṇas, he should perform the actions prescribed in godāna ceremony (and not the obser vances like remaining silent). He should 979 alter the mantras (of godāna ) so that they refer to himself.

Madhuparka will be dealt with under marriage.</p>
<p>The Baud. gp. paribhāṣı says (I. 14. 1) that the samāvarlana rite for him who is only a vratasnātaka ( and has not studied the Veda ) is performed silently (i. e. without the mantras prescribed ). The other gļhya sūtras have a similar procedure in samāvartana, only the mantras sometimes differ and a few details are added.</p>

<p>Procedure of Samāvarlana</p>
<p>For example, San. gr. (IIL 1.2) makes the student sit on bull&rsquo;s hide. Par. gp. (II. 6) prescribes that eight jars full of water are to be placed on kusa grass and water therefrom is to be poured over the head and the body of the student with certain mantras, that he is to worship the rising sun, to par take of curds or sesame seeds, to cleanse his teeth with an udumbara twig, he sees himself in a mirror ( after adorning himself ). Both Par. and Gobhila (IIL. 4. 23 ) say that in this rite the girdle is taken off. Gobhila ( III. 4. 31-34 ) says that at the end of the rite the student should mount &amp; chariot drawn by oxen, drive some distance in an eastern or northern direction, should then come back to the teacher who honours him with madhuparka, Hir. gr. (1. 9. 10) says that the girdle, the staff and the black antelope skin that he wore as brahma cirin are to be thrown into water. The Laghu-Ăśvalāyana smrti ( 14th section ) appears to suggest that godāna and sama Vartana take place on the same day and that at the end of the homa in samāvartana &amp; student of the Rgveda should unloosen the girdle of muñja grass with the inantra &lsquo;ud uttamam mumugdbi&rsquo; (Rg. I. 25,21). It is for this reason that in the Maratha country samāvartana is called &lsquo;sodmuñja&rsquo; (rite in which the inučja girdle is taken away).</p>
<p>The gūtras more or less prescribe expressly or impliedly the same materials that are required by Āśvaldyana. Vide Bhār, gr. II. 18 ( whioh enumerates them in one place ). Baud. gr. paribhāṣā sūtra I. 13. 1.</p>
<p>Some of the sūtras specify the auspicious times when this rite is to be performed. Hir. g!. I. 9. 3 lays down that the proper time for snāna is during the northern course of the sun, in the bright half of a montb when the moon is in conjunction with Rohini, Mrgasiras, Tiṣya (Pugya ), Uttara Phalguni, Hasta, Citrā, or Visakha. The Baud. gr. paribhāṣā (L 13. 3-9) omits Mrgasiras out of these, while Bhar. gr. (II. 18 ) omits Rohiṇi and Mrgasiras and adds Svāti. Medieval and modern digests add elaborate rules about the astrological details for the proper day of samāvartana, which are passed over here. Vide Samskāraprakasa pp. 576-578 for some of these details.</p>
<p>Numerous rules are laid down in the smrtis and digests about anatakas (@natakadharmaḥ). Many of these rules are applicable to grhasthas also (i. e. anatakas who have married ). Those rules are too numerous to enumerate. But some idea may be conveyed by quoting in full the rules in Asv. RI.</p>

<p>(III. 9. 6-7) which has the shortest treatment and adding a few interesting items from other works. Aśv. gr. (III. 9. 6–7) says &lsquo;He (the snātaka ) should not bathe at night, nor bathe naked, nor lie down naked, he should not look at a naked woman except during intercourse, ho shall not run when it rains, he should not climb up a tree, nor descond into a well, should not cross a river (by swimming) with his arms, he should not expose himself to a danger. A great being indeed is a snātaka&ndash;so it is known (from the śruti). Ap. Dh. S. (I. 11. 30. 6-1 11. 32. 29), Vas. XII. 1-47, Gaut. IX, Yaj. I. 129-166, Manu IV. 13ff, Viṣnu Dh. S. 71, Pār. gr. II. 1 contain an exhaus tive treatment of snātaka vratas. Some of these are concerned with the rules about anadhyāyas, about answering calls of nature, about persons whose food should not be taken, about sexual intercourse, about acamana, about daily observances like the five mabāyajñas, about upākarma and utsarjana. These have been or will be dealt with in the appropriate places. A few of the other important rules of conduct are: a snataka should always be pure (in body), should daily bathe and should apply fragrant unguents (like sandal-wood paste) to his body, should be always patient, persistent in his under takings, self-restrained, generous and not disposed to cause injury to others (Gaut. 9.7 and 73 ); he should speak the truth and also speak what is agreeable, but should not tell disagree able truths, nor should he tell agreeable lies (Manu IV. 138 and Gaut. IX, 68 ); he should according to his ability try to make his day fruitful as regards the performance of meritorious acts, satisfaction of (legitimate ) desires and acquisition of wealth, but he should look upon dharma as the principal of the three puruṣārthas (Gaut. IX. 46-47, Manu 1V. 176, Yaj. I. 156 ), though he should avoid even what is allowed by the sās. tras if it is bateful to the people; he should not beg (for his liveli hood) of anybody except the king or bis pupils, but when oppres sed by hunger he may beg a little such as a cultivated or uncul tivated field, &amp; cow, goats and sheep, or gold, corn, food (Vas. XII. 2-3, Gaut. IX, 63-64, Manu IV. 33-34, Yāj. I. 130); but he should not beg of a king who is not of ksatriya descent or who sets at naught the dictates of the sāstras (Manu IV. 84, 87) nor should he stay in the kingdom of a sūdra king (Manu IV. 61); he should not talk with the mlecchas, impure persons and irreligious persons (Gaut. IX. 17 ); he should not dwell in contact with sinners, cāndalas and other untouchables, with fools or persons puffed up with the pride of wealth &amp;o. (Manu IV, 79); he should</p>

IX. 66 ); he should not engage in wordy quarrels with his parents, guests, brothers, sisters, persons connected by marriage, maternal uncles, dependents, relations, sacrificial and family priests, children, wife, slaves (Manu IV. 179–180=śāntiparva 244, 14-16, Yāj. I. 157-158 ); he should carry a bamboo stick, a water jar, kuśa grass, wear two yajñopavitas, two garments (upper and lower) and two golden ear-rings (Manu IV. 36, Yaj. I. 133, Vas. XII. 14, 37-38); if he has inoney enough he should not wear old and dirty clothes, his garments should be white, be should not wear garments that are dyed and black oloth even when that is its natural colour (Ap. Dh. S. I. 11. 30, 10-13, Manu IV. 34-35, Yāj. 1. 131, Gaut. IX. 4-5 ) nor should he wear the clothes, shoes, and garland of another and if he wears those of another owing to poverty, he should thoroughly clean them (Gaut. IX. 6-7, Manu IV.66); he should not allow his beard to grow unless there is some good ground to do so and should pare his nails (Gaut. IX. 8, Manu V. 95, Yaj. I. 131); while his shoes are in his band he should not sit on &amp; seat nor should he salute a person or bow to a deity (Gaut.

<p>Manu (XI. 203 ) says that the prāya citta for not observing the rules of conduct laid down for enātakas is fasting for a day. Haradatta on Gautama IX. % says that the rules for snātakas are meant for brahmaṇa and kṣatriya snātakas only, that the prāyaścitta for non-observance is also to be undergone by them and that the vaisya snātakas are not obliged to observe these rules.</p>
<p>In modern times samāvarta na often takes place &amp; short time after upadayana and sometimes on the 4th day thereafter or even the next day. As many brābmanas do not learn any part of the Veda, samāyartana has become a mere matter of form in their case. Even the Samskārakaustubba (p. 607) presoribes a very brief procedure for samāvartana when the brahmacāri is ill. It consists in the brahmacārl giving up his girdle &amp;o., in shaving the boy silently, in silently bathing at a holy place, putting on anotber garment, then sipping water twice, bringing fire from the house of a śrotriya and plaoing it on some place according to the rules, then contemplating on Prajāpati and putting the samidh (fuel-stick) on fire.</p>

<p>theory of the</p>
<p>In the preceding pages several questions connected with brahmacarya have been dealt with. Brahmacarya is, according to the theory of the dharmasutras and smśtis, the first of the four āśramas. Therefore, before proceeding to the next samskāra, viz. vivāha ( marriage ) which is the starting point of the second āśrama, it is necessary to discuss the origin and deve lopment of the idea of asramas.</p>
<p>From the times of the most ancient dharmasutras the number of aśramas bas been four, though there are slight differences in the nomenclature and in their sequence. 988 Ap. Dh, 8. II. 9.21. 1 says &lsquo;there are four āśramas, viz. the stage of householder, ( staying in) the teacher&rsquo;s house, stage of being a muni, the stage of being a forest dweller.&rsquo; That here mauna stands for the aśrama of sannyāsa is clear from Apastamba&rsquo;s own words in II. 9. 21.7 (atha parivrājah ) where he employs the word ' parivrāj&rsquo; to indicate' mauna, Āp. places the house holder first among the āāramas, probably on account of the importance of that stage to all other Aśramas. Why he should mention the stage of forest hermit last is not clear, Gaut. also (III, 2 ) enumerates the four āśramas as brahmacāri, grhastha, bhikṣu and vaikhānasa. Here also Gaut, speaks of bhikṣu before vaikhānasa and Haradatta 988 explains this departure from the usual sequence of aśramas as due to the words in Gaut, 28. 47 where we read&rsquo;prāg-uttamad traya āśramiñaḥ'(persons belonging to the three asramas except the last may constitute a pariṣad ), 1. o. to exclude vaikhānasa from the pariṣad he is mentioned last, Why the vānaprastha is called vaikhānasa will be discussed later on under the former word. Vas. Dh. 8. (VII. 1-%) names the four aśramas as brahmaoāri, grhastha, vānaprastha and parivrājaka.</p>

<p>Vas. Dh. S. (in XI. 34) employs the word yuti to denote 8 person in the fourth aśrama. Baud. Db.S.(I1.6.17) names the four āśra mas in the same way as Vasiṣtha and vouchsafes the interesting</p>
<p>information that it was the asuru Kapila, son of Prablāda, who in his rivalry with the gods, made these distinctions to which &amp; wise man should pay no heed. Wlist Baud.990 means appears to be that there is really one āśrama viz. that of the householder, that Kapila devised the scheme of four aśramas, so that those who become yānaprasthas and parivrājakas would perform no yajñas and thereby the gods would lose the offer. ings they received from men and become less powerful Manu VI. 87 speaks of the four asramas, the last being called yati by him and also &lsquo;samnyāsa&rsquo; ( in VI. 96 ). It would thus be seen that a person who belongs to the last asrama is variously called parivrāt or parivrājuka ( one who does not stay in one place but wanders from place to place ), bhikṣu (one who begs for his livelihood ), nuni (one who ponders over the mysteries of life and death ), yati ( one who controls his senses ) These words suggest the various characteristics of the man who undertakes the fourth āśrama.</p>
<p>The theory of Manu about these aśramas is as followe. The span of human life is one hundred years ( satāyur vai puruṣaḥ). All do not live to that age, but that is the maximum age one can expect to reach. This should be divided into four parts. As one cannot know beforehand what age one is going to reach, it is not to be supposed that these four parts are each of 25 years. They may be more or less. As stated in Manu IV, 1 the first part of man&rsquo;s life is brabmacarya in which he learns at his teacher&rsquo;s house and after he has finished his study, in the second part of his life he marries and becomes an house holder, discharges his debts to his ancestors by begetting Bons and to the gods by performing yajñas ( Manu V. 169 ). When he sees that his head has grey hair and that there are wrinkles on his body he resorts to the forest i. e. becomes a Vānaprastha (Manu VI. 1-2). After spending the third part of his life in the forest for some time he spends the rest of bia life as a samnyāsins (Manu VI. 33). Similar rules are found</p>

<p>The word āśrama does not occur in the Sambitās or Brāb. maṇas. But this cannot be stretched to mean that the stages of life denoted by this word in the sutras were unknown throughout the Vedic period. It has been shown above (p. 268) that the word brabmacarl occurs in the Rgveda and the Atharva veda and that brahmacarya is mentioned in the Tai. S., the Sat. Br. and other ancient Vedic works. So the stage of brabmacarya was well known in the remotest past. The fact that Agni is said to be *the gļhapati in our house (Rg. II. 1.2) 994 and the fact that in the famous verse (Rg. X. 85. 36 ) which is employed even to. day in the marriage ceremony the husband says to the bride when taking bold of her hand that the gods gave her to bim for gārbapatya (for attaining the position of a house-owner or housebolder) establish that the second stage of the householder was well-known to the Rgveda. There is nothing in the Vedic Literature expressly corresponding to the vānaprastha. It may however be stated that the Tāṇdya Mahabrāhniana 14. 4. 7 Aays that vaikhanasa sages were the favourites of Indra and that one Rahasya Devamalimluc killed them in a place called Munimaraṇa. Vaikbanasa means &lsquo;vānaprastha&rsquo; in the sūtras and it is possible that this is the germ of the idea of vāda prastha. &ldquo;Yati' used in the sutras and smrtis to indicate the fourth asramna of samnyaga does occur in the oldest Vedic texts. But there the meaning appears to be different. In the Rg. the word &lsquo;yati&rsquo; occurs several times. But the sense is doubtful. Rg. VIII. 3. 9 runs · whereby ** when wealth was bes towed on Burgu and on yatis (or &lsquo;on Bhṛgu from yatis&rsquo;) you pro tected Praskaṇva'. Rg. VIII. 6. 18 reads &lsquo;O Indra, the yatis and those who were Bhrgus praised thee&rsquo;; Rg. X. 72. 7 says &lsquo;O gods,</p>

<p>when you filled the worlds as the yatis ( did) you brought tbe sun bidden in the sea&rsquo;. In the Tai.&quot;' S. VI.2.7.5 we read &lsquo;Indra threw yatis to the salāvṣkas (hyaenas or wolves), they devoured them to the south of the Uttaravedi.&rsquo; The same words and story occur in the Kathaka sambitā VIII. 5, the Ait. Br. 35. 2 (prādat) and the Kauṣitaki Up. III. 1; in the last Indra said to Pratardana</p>
<p>do know me only; I regard this as the most beneficial thing to man that he should know me. I killed the three-headed Tvāṣtra. I gave to the sālāvśkas the Arunmukha yatis.' In the Kathaka samhita (IV. 10) and the Tai. S. II. 4. 9. 2 it is stated that the heads of the yatis when they were being devoured fell aside and they (the heads) became the kharjūras (date palıns). Atharvaveda II. 5. 3. says &lsquo;Indra, who is quick in bis attack, who is Mitra and who killed Vṛtra as he did the yatis.&rsquo; In the Tāndya Mahābrahmana VIII. 1. 4 Bṛhadgiri is said to be one of the three yatis who escaped from slaughter and who were then taken under his protection by Indra. All these passages taken together suggest that the yatis were people who had incurred the hostility of Indra, the patron of the Aryas, that they were slaughtered by the Aryas with the help of Indra and their bodies were thrown to the wolves and that they seem to have something to do with a country where the date.palm grew and that a few of them who escaped slaughter subse quently were won over and became the worshippers of Indra (and therefore in Rg. VIII. 6. 18 they are described as praising Indra ). So originally they were probably beyond the pale of the Vedio Aryans. If there is any connection betwoen yati and yatu ( sorcery ) which seems possible, the yatis were pro bably non-vodic sorcerers.</p>
<p>In the Rg. X, 136. 2, there is a references to munis, who are wind-girt and who put on brownish dirt (dirty garments). In Rg. VIII. 17. 14 Indra is said to be the friend of munis (Indro muni. nām saklā) and in Rg. X. 136. 4 muni is said to be the friend of all gods. So it appears that even in the times of the Rgveda persons</p>

<p>who led a life of poverty, contemplation and mortification were known, and were honoured and called munis, while persons corresponding to them among non-vedic people were probably called yatis. But in both these words there is no idea of a certain stage in a well-knit scheme of life. Perhaps the earliest reference to the four āśramas, though somewhat obscure, occurs in the Ait. Br. 33. 11 &lsquo;what (use is there ) of dirt, what use of antelope skin, what use of (growing) the beard, what is the use of tapas? O! brāhmaṇas I desire a son, he is a world that is to be highly praised.* *98 Here it is clear that ajina refers to brahmacarya, smaśrūṇi to vānaprasthas ( since accord ing to Manu VI, 6 and Gaut. III. 33 tbe vānaprestha had to grow his hair, beard and nails). Therefore &lsquo;malam&rsquo; and &lsquo;tapas&rsquo; must be taken respectively as indicating the householder and the sainnyāsin. A much olearer reference to three aśramas occurs in the Chandogya&rsquo;s Up. II. 23. 1 &lsquo;there are three branches of dharma, the first (is constituted by ) sacrifice, study and charity (i. e. by the stage of householder), the second is (constituted by the performance of) tapas (i. e. the vānaprastha), the third is the brahmacārl staying in the house of his teacher and wearing himself out till death in the teacher&rsquo;s house ; all these attain to the worlds of the meritorious; but one who ( has correctly understood brahma) and abides in it attains immortality&rsquo;. Tapas is a characteristic of both vānaprastha and parivrājaka. Therefore in this passage it is possible to hold that the three āśramas ( of student, householder and vāna prastha ) are mentioned. The last clause about &lsquo;brahmasamstha&rsquo; differentiates the three asramas from him who has knowledge</p>

<p>of brahma and holds fast by it. That portion says that the consequence of the knowledge of brahma is immortality ; but it does not say expressly or impliedly that the stage of parivrājaka is a means of attaining the knowledge of brahma, So one may doubt whether samnyaga as an asrama is spoken of here, but there can be no doubt that the other three are clearly indioated here. Probably in the time of the Chāndogya there was no clear line of demarcation between the āśrainas of vānaprastha and earnyāsa and they rather coalesced into each other. Chān. Up. V, 10.1 and Br. Up. VI. 2. 15 support this conolusion 9000. In the Br. Up. III. 5. 1 there is a reference to brābmapas who on apprehending correct ly the Suprema Spirit turn away from the desires of progeny, wealth and of securing holy worlds and practise begging. Begging is a characteristic of samnyāsa in the sutras. Yājña valkya in the Bṛ. Up. IV.5. 2. tells his wife Maitreys that he was going into a life of prairajyā from being a householder. Mundaka Up. I. %. 11 refers to begging for him who has know ledge of brahma and Mundaka III. 2. 6 mentions &lsquo;gamnyāsa &lsquo;. In the Jabalopaniṣad 1001 (4) it is said that Janaka asked Yājña. valkya to expound sainnyāsa and then the four asramas are distinotly set out ' after finishing the stage of student-hood, one should become a householder; after becoining a householder one should become a forest-dweller, after being a forest-dweller, one should renounce the world; or he may do otherwise viz. he may renounce the world after the stage of student-hood itself or after being an householder or from the forest. The very day on which he becoines desireless, he should renounce the world (become a saṁnyasin). Probably this passage 100% was not</p>

<p>before the author of the Vedantagūtra or ho did not regard tbe Jābālopaniṣad as very authoritative ; itherwise thero would hardly have been any need for the Vedāntabūtrakāra (in the Vedantasūtra III. 4. 18-20 ) to hold a discussion on Chandogya II. 23. 1.</p>
<p>It is clear that in the tiines of the earliest Upanisade at least three ( if not four) asramas were known and that all four were known by their specific names to the Jābālopaniṣad. In the Svetaśyataropaniṣad (VI. 21 ) we have the word * atyāśramibhyah&rsquo;. It is said there that the sage Svetasvatara, who acquired knowledge of Brahma, proclaimed the knowledge to those who had rison above the mere observances of asramas.</p>
<p>No scholar Eastern or Western places Pānini later than 300 B. C. He knew Bhiksu-sūtras composed by Pārāśarya and Karnanda 1003 and he tells us that the word &lsquo;maskarin &ldquo;1004 means parivrājaka. As sūtra works about &lsquo;bhikṣus&rsquo; were composed before Pāṇini, this asrama of bhikṣus must have been an established institution centuries before Pāṇini. Buddhism took over tbis mode of life (pabbrijjū as tho Pali works gay ) from the brahmanical system.</p>
<p>It has been already stated at p. 8 that the goals of existence were deemed to be four, viz dharma, artha, kama and mokṣa. The highest goal was mokṣa. All ancient Indian philosophy (whether Vedānta, Sāṁkhya or Nyaya) held that liberation from the never-ending cycle of births and deaths, and escape from the three kinds of duḥkha were the highest good. The gummum bonum consisted in non-return (anavșttih) to the world of pleasures and sorrows. The Chan. Up. 100VIII. 15. 1 winds up with the words and be does not return&rsquo;. The Br. Up. VI. 2. 15, Prasna Up. I. 10 and others say the same. This supreme goal had fascinated all noble minds in whatever Bphere of life they might have been working. The greatest poot and dramatist of classical Sanskrit ends his most famous drama ( the Sākuntala ) with the prayer may self-existent God Śiva destroy for me rebirth 1006 This state of liberation or release is variously oalled mokṣa or mukti, amptatva, nihāreyasa,</p>

<p>kaivalya ( by the Saṅkhyas) or apavarga (Nyāyasūtra I. 1.2 ). For attaining this state man must know and realize that thero is only one Reality underlying all existence (and no plurality) and become disgusted with the passions and temptations of the world i. e. ho must bave nirveda and vairāgya ( as stated in the Bș, Up. III. 5.1 or Mundaka I. 2. 12). Merely reading from the books that desirelessness is necessary for release and immediately giving up the world would not serve the purpose. The man would be hankering, as the Bhagavadgitā says, after pleasures he has renounced. Therefore the anoient Indian writers devised according to their lights a schemo which is embodied in the theory and practice of the āśramas. In brahma carya the individual goes through the discipline of the will and the emotions, makes himself acquainted with the literary treasures of the past and learns obedience, respect, plain living and high thinking. Then he marries, becomes a householder, tastes the pleasures of the world, enjoys life, has gone, dis charges his duties to his children, to his friends, relatives and neighbours and becomes a useful, industrious and worthy oitizon, the founder of a family. It is supposed that by the time he is fifty years or so he has become convinced of the futility of human appetites and the pleasures of the world and is, therefore, called upon to resort to a forest life for pondering over the great problem of the life hereafter and to accustom himself to self-abnegation, austerities and a barınless life. This would lead on to the last stage, viz. samnyāse. He may succeed in this very life in realizing the supreme goal of mokṣa or he may have to continue to rise in spiritual height until after several births and deaths the goal is in view. The theory of varna dealt with man as a member of the Aryan society and laid down what his rights, functions, privileges, responsibilities and duties were as a meniber of that society. It was addressed to man in the mass. The theory of asramas addressed itself to the individual. It tells him what his spiri tual goal is, low he is to order his life and what preparations are required to attain that goal. The theory of agramas was truly a sublime conception and if owing to the exigencies of the times, the conflicts of interests and distractions of life, the scheme could not even in anoient times be carried out fully by every individual and seems to have failed in modern times, the fault does not lfe with the originators of this conception. Deussen was constrained to say (in E. R. E. under asrama ) how far the practice corresponded to this theory given in</p>

<p>[ Ch. Viti</p>
<p>Manu and other law books, we do not know; but we are free to confess that in our opinion the whole history of mankind has not much that equals the grandeur of this thought' and again in &lsquo;The Philosophy of the Upaniṣads&rsquo; (tr. by Geden, 1906 ) p. 367 ' the entire history of mankind does not produce much that approaches in grandeur to this thought'.</p>
<p>The three āśramas of householder, forest hermit and sam nyāga will be dealt with in detail bereafter. Only one question about āśramas in general remains to be discussed. With refe rence to the four aśramas, there are three different points of view (pakṣas) viz. samuccaya (orderly co-ordination), vikalpa (option) and būdha (annulment or contradiction). Those who hold the first view (samuccaya) say that a person can resort to the four asramas one after another in order and that he cannot drop any one or more and pass on to the next nor can he resort to the householder&rsquo;s life after becoming a saṁnyāsin ( vide Dakṣa I. 8-9, Vedāntasūtra III. 4. 40) e, 8. a man cannot take Baṁnyāsa immediately after brahmacarya. Manu (IV. 1, VI. 1. 33-37, 87-88) is the prime supporter of this view. The first part of the Jābālopaniṣad quoted above refers to this view. This view does not regard marriage and sexual life as impure or inferior to asceticism and on the contrary places it on a higher plane than asceticisin. On the whole the tendency of most of the dharmaśāstra works is to glorify the status of an house-holder and push into the background the two āśramas of vānaprastha and sainyāsa, so much so that certain works say that these are forbidden in the Kali age. The second view is that there is an option after brahmacarya i. e. a man may be come a paritrājaka inimediately after he finishes his study or immediately after the householder&rsquo;s way of life. This view is put forward by the Jābālopaniṣad as an alternative to the first view of samuccaya. This is the view also of Vasiṣtha VII. 3, Laghu Visnu III. 1, and Yāj. III. 56. Āp. Dh. S. (II. 9. 21. 7-8 and II. 9. 22. 7-8) seems to favour this view. The third view of bādha is held by the ancient dharmasūtras of Gautama 1007 and Baudbāyana. They hold that there is really one asrama viz. that of the householder (brahmacarya being only prepara tory to it) and that the other āśramas are inferior to that of the householder. Vide Gautama (III. 1 and 35 ) where he first</p>

<p>refers to the view about vikalpa (option) and emphatically says that there is only one asrama. Manu VI. 89-90, III. 77-80, Vas. Dh, S. VIII. 14-17, Daksa II. 57-60, Viṣnu Dh. S. 59. 29 and many others praise the asrama of householder as the highest. Baud. Dh. S. (II. 6. 29 ff) says the same as Gautama and it relies 100% upon the fact that the asramas other than that of householder do not beget offspring and quotes Vedic passages viz, &lsquo;may we, O Agai, attain immortality through progeny (Rg. V, 4. 10=Tai. 8. I. 4. 46. 1) and &lsquo;a brāhmana when born is born involved in three debts, viz. he owes brahmacarya to the sages, sacrifice to the gods, and progeny to pitrs&rsquo; (Tai. 8. VI. 3. 10. 5). According to Brahmasūtra III. 4. 18 Jaimini held this view, while Bādarāyana seems to have been of the opinion that all āśramas are enjoined (ibid. III, 4. 19-20). Those who hold this view (bādha ) rely on such Vedio passages 100% as one should offer agnihotra as long as life lasts&rsquo; or &lsquo;indeed Agni. hotra is a satra (sacrificial session) that lasts till one dies by old age&rsquo; ( Sat. Br. XII. 4. 1. 1), &lsquo;one should desire to live a hundred years performing religious acts&rsquo; (Vāj. S. 40, 2), &lsquo;after bringing to the teacher wealth desired by him, do not cut off the thread of progeny&rsquo; (Tai. Up. I. 11. 1). The Mit. on Yāj. IIT. 56 sets out these three views and says that each is support - ed by Vedic texts and one may follow any one of the three. Āp. Dh, S. ( 11. 9. 21, 2) held the view that whatever āśrama out of the four one followed, one attained happiness if one performed its duties according to the śāstra and after a lengthy discussion Ap. arrives at the conclusion that thero is no dis tinotion due to superiority among the four āśramas lol. There were some who thought that the houscholder&rsquo;s life was the rulo and the other āśramas were for the blind and other incapable persons. The Mit. on Yāj. III. 56 refutes this view.</p>
<p>The word āśrama is derived 11 from &lsquo;śram&rsquo; to exert, to labour and etymologioally means &lsquo;a stage in which one exerts oneseli,</p>

<p>Commentators like Sarvajña-Narayana on Manu VI. 35 endeavour to bring about reconciliation between the three views set out above as follows: the view that &amp; man may pass on to sannyāsa immediately after the period of student-hood (without being a householder ) applies only to those men who are, owing to the impressions and effeots of restrained conduct in past lives, entirely free from desires and whose tongue, sexual appetites, belly and words are thoroughly under control ; the prescriptions of Manu enjoining on men not to resort to sarny āga without paying off the three debts are concerned with men whose appetites have not yet thoroughly been brought under control and the words of Gautama that there is only one aśrama (that of the house-holder) relate only to those whose appetites for worldly pleasures and pursuits are quite keen.</p>

<p>CHAPTER IX</p>
<p>MARRIAGE</p>
<p>This is the most inportant of all samskāres. Throughout the ages for which literary tradition is available in India marriage has been highly thought of. The several words that are employed to denote the idea of marriage indicate one or more of the elements of the samskāra of marriage. Such words are udvāha ( taking the girl out of her parental home ), vivāha ( taking the girl away in a special way or for a special purpose i. e. for making her one&rsquo;s wife ), pariṇaya or pariṇayana (going round i. e. making a pradakṣiṇā to fire), upayama (to bring near and make one&rsquo;s own), and panigrahana ( taking the hand of the girl). Though these words express only one component element of the rite of marriage they are all used in the sāstras 1018 to indicate the totality of the several acts that go to make up the ceremony of marriage. The word &lsquo;vivāha occurs in the Tai. S. VII. %. 87 and Alt. Br. (27.5). In the Tāṇdya 1013 Mahābrābmaṇa VII. 10.1 it is said that &ldquo;heaven and earth were once together but they became separate &lsquo;; then they said let us bring about a marriage, let there be a co-ope ration between us&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before dwelling upon the various aspects of marriage, the question, whether our authorities point to &amp; state of society when there was no institution of marriage, but there was only promisouity, requires to be considered. The Vedic works con tain no indications about a society in which the relations of the sexes were promiscuous and unregulated. In the Mabā. bhārata, 1014 however, Pāṇdu is made to state to his queen Kunti that women in former ages were under no control, indulged themselves as they liked and that they left off one man and</p>

<p>went after another, that this state of things continued to his (Pāṇdu&rsquo;s ) day in the country of Uttara Kuru, that it was Śretaketu, son of Uddālaka, who for the first time stopped all this license and laid down the rule that if a woman proved false to her husband or if a husband was false to a chaste wife, very grave sin would be incurred. In the Sabhāparva (31. 37-38 ) it is said that through the favour of Agni women in Mābiṇmati did what they liked and could not be restrained. These passages cannot be relied upon for proving promisouity of intercourse. In the first place, the country of Uttara Kuru is more or less inythical. This passage rather gives expression to what the poet imagined about remotest ages and not what he knew was the real state of society thousands of years before him. The theory of an original state of promiscuity onoe advanced by Reveral sociologists has now ceased to be respectable (vide Mrs. M. Cole in &lsquo;Marriage, past and present&rsquo;p. 10.</p>
<p>The purpose of marriage, even according to the Rgveda, was to enable a man, by becoming a householder, to perform sacrifices to the gods and to procreate song. The verse in Rg. X. 85. 36 shows that the husband took a woman as a wife for &lsquo;gārbapatya&rsquo;. Rg. V. 3. %., V. 28. 3 speak of the co-operation of husband and wife in the worship of gods. Rg. III. 53, 4 contains the emphatic assertion the wife herself is the home&rsquo; (jāyed-astam). In later literature also the same statement occurs. A wife was called &ldquo;jāya &lsquo;, because the husband was born in the wife as a son (Ait. Br. 33. 1). The Sat. Br. V. 2. 1. 10 says &lsquo;the wife ons is indeed half of one&rsquo;s self; therefore as long as a man does not secure a wife so long he does not beget a son and so he is till then not complete (or whole); but when he secures a wife he gets progeny and then he becomes complete&rsquo;. Tho Ait. Ār. (I. 2. 4 ) says therefore a man, after securing a wife, regards himself as more complete&rsquo;. When Ap. Dh. S. II. 5. 11. 12 forbids taking a second wife if the first is endowed with progeny and the performance of religious rites, it indicates</p>

<p>that the main purposes of marriage are two, 1014 vie. the wife enables a man to perform religious rites and is the mother of a son or sons who were supposed to save &amp; man from hell. Manu (IX. 28 ) states that on the wife depend the procreation of sons, the performance of religious rites, service, highest pleasure, heaven for oneself and for one&rsquo;s ancestors. So these three viz, dharnasampatti, prajā (and consequent freedom from falling into hell ) and ruti (sexual and other pleasures) are the principal purposes of marriage according to the smrtis and niba ndbas. Yāj. I. 78 is to the same effect. Jaimini (VI. 1. 17 ff) establishes that husband and wife hare to perform saorifices together and not separately and Āp. Dh, S.0II. 6. 13. 16-17 emphatically says that there can be no separation between husband and wife, for since marriage they have to perform religious acts jointly.</p>
<p>Marriage is a composite rite comprising several subordinate elements which have to be done in a certain order and the last of which is seeing the constellation of the seven sages; it (rite ) brings about the status of a woman as a person&rsquo;s wife.1018</p>
<p>The first consideration is : how to choose a bridegroom and what qualifications make a person a very desirable bridegroom, Agy. gṛ. (1. 5. 2) says &lsquo;one should give &amp; maiden &lsquo;18 (in marriage ) to a man endowed with intelligence&rsquo;. The Āp. gr. (3.20 ) remarks &ldquo;the accomplishments of &amp; bridegroom are that he must be endowed with good family, a good character, auspicious characteristics, learning and good health&rdquo;. Baud. Dh. S. IV. 1.12 states &lsquo;a maiden should be given in marriage to one who is endowed with good qualities and who is a colibate (till then)&rsquo;. Even the Sakuntala (IV) echoes the words of</p>

<p>Baudhāyana &lsquo;the best idea is to give one&rsquo;s daughter to a man endowed with good qualities&rsquo;. Yanna quoted in the Sm. C.(I. p. 78) says &lsquo;one should seek for seven qualities in a bridegroom viz. good family, good character, bodily appearance, fame, learning, wealth and support (of relatives and friends ); the other matters need not be considered&rsquo;. Bphat-parāśara (p. 118 Jiv. ed.) enumerates eight qualities in a bridegroom viz. oaste, learning, youth, strength, health, support of many (friends &amp;o.), ambi. tions ( arthitva ), and possession of wealth. Aśv.gr. (1. 5. 1) and others place kula (a good family ) in the forefront in the case of both the bride and the bridegroom. 1080 &lsquo;One should first examine the family ( of the intended bride or bridegroom ) as it has been said above (in the Asv. Srauta gūtra IX. 3).&rsquo; The Āsv. Srauta reads &lsquo;those who on their mother&rsquo;s as well as their father&rsquo;s side through ten generations are endowed with learning, austerity and meritorious works or whose pure brāhmaṇa lineage can be traced on both sides (for ten gonera. tions) or according to some on the father&rsquo;s side.&rsquo; Manu regarded a good family as the most important from the eugenic point of view. In IV. 244 he says &lsquo;one who desires to raise his family to excellence and eminence should always enter into marriage alliances with the best and avoid alliance with the low&rsquo;; and adds (III. 6-7) that ten kinds of families even though richly endowed with cattle, wealth &amp;o, should be avoided in marriage viz, in which the samskāras are not performed, in which there is no malo progeny, which are devoid of Veda (study), which have hairy members, that suffer from piles or consumption or indigestion or epilepsy, white or black leprosy. Manu ( III. 63-65 ) explains under what circumstances good families are reduced to a bad state. Hārita states that the offspring is in accordance with the (qualities of the) family of the parents. The Hargacarita ( IV) gives expression to the view that generally the wise look to good family first even though there may be other qualities in the bridegroom. Manu II. 238, however, allows a man to marry a girl even from an inferior or bad family provided she is &amp; jewel among women.</p>

<p>Marriage and good family</p>
<p>431</p>
<p>Yāj. (I. 54-55 ) emphasizes the importance of a good family famed for ton generations and freedom from diseases that are hereditarily transmitted and adds that the bride groom must be young, intelligent, &amp; favourite among the people and his virility must be carefully tested. The Mit. on Yaj. 1. 55 quotes Nārada (stripumsa ) who mentions some characteristics of the virile man and enumerates fourteen varieties of impotent persons ( verses 11-13). Katyāyana 1081 mentions what defective bridegrooms are to be avoided viz. the lunatic, one guilty of grave sins, leprous, impotent, one of the same gotra, one bereft of eyesight or hearing, an epileptio and adds that these defects are to be avoided even among brides. The Mahābhārata observes &lsquo;friendship and marriage should take place between those alone whose wealth is similar and whose learning (i, e. the learning in whose fami lies) is of equal status, not between opulent (well-off) and the poverty-stricken&rsquo;. 1028</p>
<p>Though Manu and Yāj. indicate that impotent persons are not eligible for marriage, yet such persons &lsquo;rarely married. Their marriages were held valid by Manu, Yāj. &lsquo;and others and their sons (by niyoga) took property as if they were aurasa sons. Vide Manu IX. 203 and Yāj. II. 141-142.</p>
<p>The Saṁskāraprakāśa (pp. 752-754 ) contains a long dis cussion on the question how from bodily characteristics one can find whether a man will live long or what bis prospects would be. These are passed over for want of space.</p>
<p>Rules for the selection of the bride are far more elaborate than those for selecting a bridegroom, though in some respects they are the same (such as about the necessity of good family, about the absence of diseases &amp;o.). Vide Vas I. 38, Viṣnu Dh. S. 24. 11, Kāmasūtra III. 1. 2. 1028 Even the Sat. Br. (I. 2. 5. 16 )</p>

I. 5. 6 and Manu III. 4 and Yāj. I. 52 also require that the girl should be possessed of auspicious charac teristios (or indications). These (lakṣanas) are of two kinds, bāhya ( visible or bodily characteristics ) and ābbyantara (invisible). Āp. gr. 1025 (III. 21 ) states a commonsense rule: &lsquo;a girl on whom his mind and eyes are riveted will bring him happiness (or prosperity ), he should pay no heed to other things; this is the view of some&rsquo;. The Kāmasutra quotes the view of Ghotakamukha &lsquo;he should proceed to marry a girl on taking whom as his wife he would regard himself as blessed and would not be blamed by his friends (or persons in a similar station in life ) 1026 Manu III. 8 and 10, Viṣṇu Dh. S. 24. 12-16 say that one should not marry a girl having tawny hair or having an excessive limb (such as a sixth finger) or a deficient limb, who is bairless or very hairy, who is talkative and has yellowish eyes; but should marry a girl who has limbs void of any defect, whoso gait is like that of a swan or an elephant, the hair on whose head or body is of slight growth and whose teeth are small, whose body is delicate. The Viṣnu-purāna ( III. 10. 18-22 ) adds that the girl must not have a marked growth of hair on her chin or lip, her voice must not be hoarse or like that of a crow; her legs and ankles must not be very hairy, there should be no dimples on her cheeks when she laughs, she should not be very dwarfish or very tall &amp;c. Manu III. 9 and Ap. gp.

<p>of a mountain, of a bird, of a snake or of a slave or a name that is terrifio. Ap. gr. (III. 14 ) and Kamasūtra III, 1. 13 mention that a girl should not be chosen, the penultimate letter of whose name is r or I (such as Gaurl, sāli, Kamalū). Nārada 1087 ( strl pumseyoga 36 ) says that defects of girls are as follows:when they suffer from long-standing or disgusting diseases, when they are devoid of a limb or have already had connection with an other man, when they are wicked or have their minds fixed on another; and Ap. gr. (III. 11-12 ) states other defects of girls viz, one should not choose a girl who is asleep or weeps or has left the house when persons come to see whether she can be chosen. Vide Mārkandeya-purana 34. 76-77 for guṇas and defects of girls as &lsquo;brides&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Bhār.gf. I. 11 says that there are four inducing reasons 148 for marrying a particular girl viz. wealth, beauty, intelligence and family. If all four cannot be secured, wealth may be neglected (as the least important of all ); then beauty may be neglected if there is intelligence and good family, but there is a difference of view as to the latter two, some preforring intelligence to family and others family to intelligence. Mānava gf. (I. 7.6–7) adds a fifth inducement for marriage, viz. vidya (learning) after beauty and before prajñā. Vide also Vārāha gf. 10.</p>
<p>Some of the gļhyasūtras propose a peculiar mystical method of selecting a bride. The Asv. gr. (1. 5. 3) after stating that one should select a girl endowed with good characteristics (lakṣaṇas ) proceeds &lsquo;lakṣaṇas are very difficult to discern and therefore prescribes (I. 5.5-6) that eight lumps of different kinds of earth should be taken respectively from a field that yields two crops a year, from a cow-stable, from a vedl ( sacrifi cial altar, after sacrifice is performed), from a pool of water that does not dry up, from a gambling place, from a place where four roads meet, from a barren &lsquo;spot, and from &amp; burial ground; then he should recite over the lumps the formula&rsquo; fla (right) has been born first in the beginning; truth is founded ( or fixed) in fta; may this girl attain here that for which she is born; may what is true be visible;&rsquo; then he says to the girl</p>

<p>take one of these&rsquo;. According as she chooses the lump, it may respectively be deemed that she will have offspring rich in food (if she chooses the lump of the earth taken from the field of two crops a year &amp;c. ), or rich in cattle, or rich in spiritual lustre or rich in everything, or addicted to gambling, or wandering in different directions or poor, or that she will bring death to her husband ( if she takes the lump of the earth from the burial ground). The Gobhila gr. II. 1. 4-9 speaks of these lumps and adds that a ninth lump may be formed by mixing up the earths of all eight varieties and that if she takes up any one of the four lumps of earth from an altar, furrow, a pool or a cow-stable or (according to some ) the ninth lump, she may be selected. The Laugākṣi gr. 14. 4-7 contains the same rules as in Gobhila. Āp. gr. 1048 (III. 15-18) prescribes a somewhat different method. If both sides agree, the bridegroom (or his friends) should place in one lump of earth several kinds of seeds (such as rice, barley &amp;o.); he should take (a lump having in it) the dust from an altar, &amp; third having a clod from &amp; ploughed field, a lump having cowdung inside and (a fifth having) a clod of earth from a cemetery and keep ing them before the girl ask her to touch one of them (the five ). If she touches any one of the first four, that is an indication of future prosperity (of the nature of the object touched ), but the last ( viz. clod of earth from cemetery ) is objectionable. The Vārāba gr. 10 and Bhār, gr. I. 11 speak of only four lumps of earth viz. from a field, from an altar, from a cow-stable, and from a cemetery and say that one should not marry a girl who takes up the lump of cemetery earth. Mānava gf. (1. 7. 9-10) speaks of eight lumps but substitutes &amp; lump of earth where dūrvā grows and a lump from under a tree filled with fruit for earth from a pool of water and one from &amp; gambling place and adds that the eight lumps should be placed in a temple and if the girl takes up the lump from a cemetery or from a barren spot or from where four roads meet she should not be married. Many digests like the Gr. R. (pp. 13-22) contain long quotations which dilate upon the indications about the auspiciousness or otherwise of girls from their several physi. cal features.</p>

<p>than the bridegroom and the Kāmagūtra ( III. 1. 2) recommends that she must be younger than the bridegroom by at least three years. The Mit. on Yaj. I. 52 explains &lsquo;yavlyasi&rsquo; as meaning &lsquo;younger in age and smaller in stature&rsquo; (than the bridegroom). What the age of marriage was will be discussed a little below.</p>
<p>Gaut. IV. 1, 1030 Vag. 8, 1, Yāj. I. 52, Manu (III. 4 and 12) and others say that one should marry only &amp; girl who is a virgin and of the same caste. How far widow-marriages and intercaste marriages were allowed would be discussed later on.</p>
<p>The Manava gr. 1.7.8, Manu III. 11 and Yāj. I. 53 require that the girl to be chosen must not be brotherless. This requirement which has been not in force for centuries has a long history behind it. In Rg. I. 124, 7 it is said 1031 &lsquo;as a brotherless maiden compos back towards her male relations (ber father&rsquo;s family)&hellip;80 the dawn reveals objects (or ber beauty ).&rsquo; In the Atharvaveda I. 17.1 wo read &lsquo;like brotherless women let thom sit still with their splendour gone. Both these passages are quoted and explained in the Nirukta III. 4-5. In ancient times when a man had no son, he could make his daughter do for a son (i. e. she herself became putrikā) and stipulate with the person marrying her that the son born of hor would be his ( i. e, the girl&rsquo;s father&rsquo;s ) son and would offor piṇdas as &amp; son to his maternal grandfather. The result would be that the son of such a girl would not offer pindas to his father and would not continue the line of his father. Rg. III. 31. 1 (a very obscure and difficult verse ) has been explained by the Nirukta ( 111.4) as referring to the practice of declaring a daughter to be one&rsquo;s son 1038. Therefore, brotherless maidens were not chosen as brides and the Rg. speaks of spinsters growing old in their parental home ( Rg. II. 17, 7). Vas. Dh. S. 17. 16 refers 1033 to</p>

<p>Rg. I. 124, 7 and quotes &amp; verse about &amp; brotherless girl. Such &amp; daughter at whose marriage the father made the stipulation stated above was called putrikā and according to Gaut. 28. 17 some 1034 teachers went so far as to say that a daughter became a putrikā by the mental resolve of the father alone ( without there being an express agreement with the bridegroom ). It is therefore that Manu (3. 11 ) ordains that one should not marry a girl that has no brother, as there is the danger of her being &amp; putrikā, The Nirukta (III. 5) quotes another 1038 Vedio passage *one should not marry &amp; brotherless woman, for she becomes the son of him (her father)&rsquo; and remarks that in this passage there is a direct prohibition against marrying &amp; brotherless maiden ( while in the passage of the Atharva veda it is indirect, being involved in a simile) and it is also expressly said that she becomes the son of her father. In medieval times this prohibi tion against marrying a brotherless girl gradually was ignored and in modern times the pendulum has swung the other way, a brotherless girl being &amp; coveted prize if her father be rich. In course of time popular feeling changed and no girl could remain unmarried if she wanted heavenly worlds. There is an interesting story in the Salyaparva chap. 52 of the daughter of Kuñigarga who, when told by Nārada that an unmarried womon could not secure heaven, married for one day Sșogavat and then went to heaven.</p>
<p>There are further restrictions about choosing &amp; girl for marriage. The rule was that a man should marry a girl of the same caste. So far there is what is called endogamy (i. e, rule requiring marriage within a certain large community ). But within this large community there were certain groups which were prohibited for marriage to a person belonging to another group of the same caste or community ( i. e. the principle of exogamy operated within the large community itself). The Hir. gr. I. 19. %, Gobhila gr. III. 4. 4, Ap. Dl. 8. II. 5. 11. 15 require that the bride to be chosen must not belong to the same gotra as that of the bridegroom. They are all silent about the sameness of prarara. Gaut. IV. %., Vas. Dh. S. VIII. 1, Mānava</p>

<p>All these prohibitions against marrying a sagotra, sapravara or sapinga girl are extremely important, as the following considerations will show. It is a canon of the Pūrvamināmsā that if there is a seen ( dṛṣta ) or easily perceptible reason for a rule stated in the sacred texts, it is only recommendatory and a breach of such a rule does not nullify the prinoipal act. But if there is an unseen (adrsta ) reason for a rule and there is &amp; breach of such rule, the principal act itself is rendered invalid and nugatory thereby. The rule about not marrying &amp; woman who is disessed or who has superfluous or deficient limbs has a seen reason viz, marriage with such a girl causes unhappiness ( if she is diseased) or comment ( if she has defi cient limbs). Therefore, if a person marries such a girl the marriage is perfectly valid. But there is no seen or easily perceptible reason for the prohibition against marrying &amp; sagotra or sapravara girl. Therefore, such rules go to the root of the matter and are obligatory and, if there is a breach of them, the marriage is no marriage, it is null and void.

Those principles are very luoidly set 1087 forth by Medhatithi on Manu III. 11, by the Mit, on Yāj. I. 53, the Madanaparijata and other works. Therefore, these questions of sagotra, sapravara and sapiṇda will be dealt with at some length later on.</p>
<p>The question of the age of marriage for men and women will now be considered. This is a very interesting and instruotive study. The age of marriage for both sexos has varied consider ably from age to age, from province to province and also from caste to caste even at the same time. 1038 As regards men there is po special rule as to the age before which &amp; man was obliged to marry. A man could remain celibate all his life, while at least in medieval and modern times marriage has been abso lutely necessary for evory girl. A man was to marry after he had finished his Vedio studies; but the period of Vedic study was fluctuating (i. e. it could be 12, 24, 36, 48 years or as much time as was necessary to master one Veda or a portion of it). Usually twelve years were devoted to brahmacarya in ancient times and as upanayana ordinarily took place in the 8th year (for brāhmaṇas) a man would ordinarily be 20 years old or more at the time of marriage. It is therefore that Manu (IX. 94) romarks that a man of thirty may marry a girl of twelve years or a man of 24 who is in a hurry to become a house holder may marry a girl of eight. Basing on this the Viṣnu purāṇa 1039 (III. 10. 16 ) says that the ages of the bride and bridegroom should be in the ratio of 1 to 3. Angiras says that the bride should be two, three, five or more years younger. In</p>

<p>Age of Marriage for girls</p>
<p>499</p>
<p>the Mahabharata 1040 Gautama is prepared to give his daughter in marriage to Uttanka if he could be a youth of 16 years. In another place the Mahabharata (Sabha 64. 14 and Vanaparva 5. 15 ) uses the simile of &amp; maiden not liking a husband of 60 years. That shows that girls were sometimes married to even old men of 60 in those days as rarely in modern times also. In the Mahabhārata (Anusāsana 44. 14) the respective ages of the bridegroom and bride are recommended as 30 and 10 or 21 and 7; while the Udvāhatattva (p. 123) and S. Pr. p. 766 quote &amp; verge from the Mahabharata that a man of 30 should marry a girl of 16 (but from the metre and context it appears that</p>
<p>sodaṣa-varṣam&rsquo; as printed should be dasa-varsām).</p>
<p>In the Rgveda there are no clear statements about the exact age when girls were married. But there are indications that many girls were married at a sufficiently matureage (at least they were not married at the tender age of eight). We have already Been (p. 435 ) that brotherless girls often remained unmarried till old age. One of the benevolent deeds 1041 of the Asvins is that they bestowed a husband on Ghoṣā who was growing old in her father&rsquo;s house. Vide algo Rg. I. 124.7, II. 17. 7, and Atharve. veda I. 17. 1. In Rg. X. 27. 12 it is said&rsquo; when a bride is fine looking and well adorned, she by herself seeks her friend from among men. That shows that girls were grown-up enough to select their husbands. Some of the verges in the marriage hymn (such as Rs. X, 85.26-27, 46 ) indicate 1018 that married girls could not have been child-wives, but must have been grown-up. On the other hand in Rg. I. 116. 1 it is said that the Nāsatyas (Asvins ) bestowed a wife on Vimada who was an arbhaga ( of tender age ). 1048 But all that is meant seems to be that Vimada was a mere boy as compared with his rival kings who had come as suitors. The two vorges Rg. I. 126. 6-7 ( which are ratber too naive ) indicate that girls were married before they had attained puberty. In Rg. I. 51. 13 Indra is said to have given to old Kaksivat a wife named Vṛcaya who is styled</p>
<p>arbhā&rsquo;(young). But that word is only used in contradistino tion to the word &lsquo;mahate&rsquo; (grown old ) applied to Kaksivat</p>

<p>and conveys no idea of her exact age. 1044 On the whole one may conclude that in the period of the Rgveda girls were probably married at any age ( either before puberty or aftor puberty ) and sometimes remained spinsters all their life. The other Samhitas and the Brāhmaṇas do not shed much light on the question of the age of marriago for girls. In the Chān. Up. Uṣasti Cakrāyana is described as dwelling in the Kuru country with his wife, who is said to have been &lsquo;ātikı&rsquo; which Samkara explains as a mere undeveloped girl : 1045</p>
<p>Coming to the ancient gshya and dharma sūtras, it will be Been from several considerations that girls were married just before the time of puberty or immediately after it. Among the several requirements of the bride to be chosen several gphys sūtras lay down that she must be s &lsquo;nagnikā&rsquo;. Vide Hir. gr. I. 19. 2, Gobhila gr. III. 4. 6, Mānava gr. I. 7. 8, Vaik. VI. 12.1046 The word nagnika is variously explained by the commentators, Mātṇdatta on Hir, gr, explains that nagnikā means&rsquo; one whose menstrual period is near&rsquo; i. e, one who is fit for intercourse, Aṣṭā vakra, the commentator of the Mānava gr., explains nagnikā as &lsquo;one who has not yet experienced the impulses and emotions of youth&rsquo; or &lsquo;one who looks pretty even without clothes&rsquo; (taking the word along with greṣtham&rsquo; that follows). The Grbyāsamgraha 1047 ( wbich is much later than the Gobhila gr.) explains' nagnika' as one who has not yet reached puberty. These varying explanations of the word &lsquo;nagnikā&rsquo; are due to the fact that when some smftis and commentators wrote child marriages were not in vogue, while they were in vogue when and where others flourished.

<p>should give away his daugbter while she is still nagnikā through fear of her attaining puberty ( wbile unmarried ).&rsquo; This shows that, according to Vas, nagnikā must have been &amp; girl of tender years or one that had not attained puberty.</p>
<p>There is another very important indication. Most of the grbyasūtras prescribe that the married couple should be celibate for at least three nights after marriage ( if not for a longer period ). For example, the Pār. gr. (1. 8 ) says1048 the married pair should (after marriage) not partake of kṣāra and lavana for three nights, should sleep on the ground ( end not on &amp; cot, for the same period ) and should not have intercourse for a year, twelve nights, six nights, three nights in the last resort&rsquo;. Vide for a similar rule Āśv. gr. I. 8. 10, Ap. gr. 8. 8-9, Sān. gr. I. 17. 5, Mānava gf. I. 14. 14, Kāthaka gr. 30. 1, Khādira gr. I. 4. 9 and others. Such an injunction against intercourse for three nigbts after marriage would have been uncalled for and extremely inappropriate if girls had been usually married when they were only eight to ten years old. Such injunctions by so many authors presuppose that girls must have generally been very near puberty or past puberty at the time of marriage. Haradatta who belongs to about the 12th century A. D. expressly says 1049 that (in his days ) in certain countries intercourse was commenced immediately after marriage and that such &amp; usage being opposed to Aśv. gr. I. 8. 10 should not be followed ( but continence should be observed at least for three days after marriage). This shows that so late as 1200 A. D. in several countries the marriageable age of girls must have been at least about 14.</p>
<p>In most of the grhyasūtras there is &amp; rite called &lsquo;oaturthi. karma&rsquo; (rite on 4th day after marriage). Vide Gobbila II. 5, Śān. gr. I. 18-19, Kbadira gf. I. 4. 12-16, Pār. gr. I. 11, Ap. gp 8. 10-11, Hir. gr. I. 23-24 &amp;o. This rite has been described above (pp. 203-204) and corresponds to the garbhādhāna of later writers (e. g. Yāj. I. 11).

<p>In some of the gļhyasūtras and smṛtis a slight prāgascitta (purificatory ceremony) is prescribed if the bride has menstrua tion during the progress of the marriage ceremonies. Vide Baud. gr. IV. 1. 10, Kausika sūtra 79. 16, Vaik. VI. 13, Atri ( ed. by Jiv. part I. p. 11 ).</p>
<p>Gaut. 1050 (18. 20-23) says &rsquo;s girl should be given in marriage before she attains the age of puberty. He who begleots it commits sin. Some declare that she should be given in marriage before she begins to wear clothes. A marria geable girl (who is not given in marriage by her father &amp;c.) should allow tbree monthly periods to pass and after wards unite herself to a blameless man of her own will and give up the ornaments received from her father (or her family)'. This passage establishes that even before Gautama (i. e. 500 or 600 B. C.) there were people who advocated marriages of infant girls that did not care to put on clothes (i. e. who had no sense of shame if they went about without clothes ), that Gautama disapproved of this view, that he only presoribed that the marriage of girls should take place before puberty and he was not horrified if girls got themselves married sometime after puberty. But it is clear that no blame attached to the girl married after puberty or to the husband; the idea, however, had arisen even then that the father or guardian incurred blame or sin by not getting a girl married before puberty. Manu (IX. 89-90) goes so far as to say &ldquo;A maiden may rather stay in her father&rsquo;s house oven till her death, though she may have attained puberty ; but the father should never give ber to one who is devoid of good qualities. A maiden after attaining puberty may wait for three years ( to see if she is given away by her father or brother &amp;o.) but after this period she should seek a husband who is similar to her.' Anugāganaparve 44. 16 is to the same effect. Baud. Dh. S. IV. 1. 14 and Vas. V. Dh. S. 17. 67-68 give the same rule as in Manu IX. 90. But both add ( Vas. 17,70-71 and Baud. Dh. S. IV.1.12) that the father or guardian inours the sin of destroying an embryo at each appearance of menses as long as the girl is</p>

<p>Early Marriage for girls</p>
<p>unmarried. Yaj I. 64 and Nārada (stripumga, verses 25-27) state the same rule.</p>
<p>On account of this change in popular beliefs and senti: ments it came to be recommended that a girl must be married early and may be given even to one 1051 who is devoid of qualities (in spite of Manu IX 89 ). Vide Baud. Db, S. IV, 1.12 and 15.</p>
<p>So we see that from about 600 B, C. to about the beginning of the Christian Ere it did not matter at all if a girl was married a few months or few years after puberty. But by about 200 A. D. (when the Yaj. smrti was composed) popular feeling had become insistent on pre-puberty marriages. The reasons for this change are not quite clear. But it is possible to hold that it was due to the following circumstances. Buddhism bad spread far and wide during these centuries with its encouragement of the institution of monks and nuns. There was laxity of morals among nuns. A further reason may be adduced viz. that girls had generally ceased to study anything, though some of them certainly did study in the times of Pāṇini and Patañjali, and so society did not like girls to remain doing nothing. From the times of the Rgveda (X. 85. 40-41) there was a mystical belief that Soma, Gandharva and Agni were the divine guardians of a girl and the Gphyāgamgraha (quoted in the oom. on Gobhila gļ. III. 4.6 ) says that Soma enjoys a girl first, then Gandharva enjoys her when her breasts develop and fire wben sbe men truates. Therefore, a feeling arose that a girl must be married even before she develops any distinct signs of femininity. Samvarta 1053 (verses 64 and 67) gives expression to this idea, Further, since marriage came to be looked upon as the upanayana in the case of women, naturally the age for upanayana (5th year) came to be looked upon as the proper age for marriage. Vide Samskārakaustubha quoted below. It came to be believed that there was no hope of heaven for a woman who died unmarried.</p>

<p>In the Salyaparva 1098 chap. 52 we have the story of a girl, daughter of Kuṇi Garga, who practised severe penanoe till she reached old age and yet was told by Nārada that if she died uomarried she would not go to heaven. The woman induced Sṭngavat of the Galava family for a day previous to her death to marry her by the promise of giving him half of her merit (punya). The Vaik. 1084 (V. 9), while describing the ceremony of funeral rites in cases of distress, mentions the curious practice of find. ing out a male of the same caste for a girl, who dies unmarried though of the age of puberty, with whom a sort of marriage is gone through and the girl is then cremated. Whatever the reasons may be, this tendency to bring down the age of marriage for girls was accentuated in the first five or six centuries of the Christian era. The Laugākṣi1055 gr. ( 19. 2 ) says &lsquo;brabmacarya for girls lasts till the 10th or 12th year&rsquo;. The Vaik. (VI. 12 ) says that a brāhmaṇa should marry a brāhmaṇa girl who is a nagnikā or gauri and defines nagnikā as a girl over eight years but less than ten and gauri as one who is between ten and twelve and has not bad menstruation, Aparārka (p. 85 ) quotes the Bhavisyapurāna to the effect that nagnikā is one who is ten years old. Vide Sm. O. quoting Samgraha. Parāśara, Yāj. and Sarvarta go even beyond this. Parāśara 1058 ( VII. 6-9) Baya' a girl of eight is called gaurl, but one who is nine years old is a rohini; one who is ten years old is a kanya; beyond this (1. e, after 10 years ) she is a rajasvalā. If a person does not give away a maiden when she has reached her 12th year, bis pitfs have to drink every month her menstrual discharge. The parents and also the eldest brother go to hell on seeing (an unmarried ) girl reaching the state of a rajasvala'. Parāśars adds that the brāhmaṇa who marries such a girl should not be spoken to or admitted to dinner in the same row (as other</p>

<p>brāhmaṇas) and that he becomes the husband of a prsall. On the other hand the Vāyupurāṇa ( 83. 44 ) extols the marriage of &amp; gauri by remarking that her son purifies 21 ancestors on bis father&rsquo;s side and 6 male ancestors on bis mother&rsquo;s side. Samvarta ( verse 65-66) bas the same two verses as Parāśara (VII. 6 and 8) and winds up (verse 67) by saying that the marriage of a girl of eight is highly commended. The saine four verses (Parābara VII. 6-9) occur in Bșhad-Yama ( Anan. ed. ) chap. 3. 19-22, but the order is different. Angiras (vv. 126-128, Ānan. ed.) has the same verses. Kaśyapa as quoted in the Gr. R. (p. 46 ) says that &amp; girl is called gauri when she is seven, a kanyakā when she is ten and kumārt when she is twelve. It will be noticed that the smṛtis of Vaikhānasa and Kaśyapa differed from Parāśara as to the definition of gauri. Further the three smstis make marriage of a girl after puberty an extremely sinful act and condemn not only the parents but also the husband, while Baud. prescribed only a slight prāyasoitta for the father alone even if there was menstruation during the marriage rites. Marloi105? (quoted in Pār. M. I. 2. p. 177) said that choosing a bride who was five years old was best. Even Manu ( 9.88 ) recommended an early marriage if a very desirable bridegroom was available. Rama and Sitā are said to have been respective. ly 13 and 6 at the time of marriage (Arapyakāṇda 47, 10-11). But this passage appears to be an interpolation. In the Balakāṇda 1058 it is expressly stated that Sita and her sisters enjoyed in private dalliance with their respective busbands immediately after marriage. If this is true then Sitā could not have been only 6 at the time of marriage.</p>
<p>The rule that brāhmana girls were to be married between 8 to 10 years became general from about the 6th or 7th century and continued down to modern times. During the last two or three decades the marriageable age of girls owing to several causes, particularly the ravages of plague and the economio condition of the middle cladres, has risen very high and marriages of girls even of poor brābmanas hardly ever take place before 16 and have to be postponed to the age of 20 and beyond.

<p>by Act 19 of 1938) has fixed the minimum age limit for girls at 14 and persons getting their daughters married before the completion of 14 years are liable to be punished in a criminal court under the Act. There is no reason to laugh at ancient Indian writers for the low age of marriage they advocated. Child marriages were common in all countries of Europe. Even in England the age limits for boys and girls were recognised by the law only at 14 and 1% respectively until 1929, when the lowest marriageable age for both was fixed at 16 (19 and 20 Geo, V. Chap. 36). Besides it must be remembered that when marriages of girls of tender years took place they were purely a sacrament. There was no question of consummation which took place only after puberty. Sages condemned intercourse even with one&rsquo;s wife before she attained puberty. 1058 Winternitz in * Die Frau,' p. 135 refers to a work of F. J. Furnivall on Child Marriages, Divorces &amp;c' between 1560-66 A. D. in England from which it is clear that marriages of children of 9 or 10(and rarely of even 2 or 3 years) took place in England only about 300 years ago.</p>
<p>These rules about the proper age for the marriage of girls affected only brābmaṇas. Sanskrit poets and dramatists always depict that the heroines in their works are grown-up at the time of marriage and even Bhavabhūti imagines that Malati, the heroine of his romantic drama of Malatimādhava, was so grown-up that it was practically a case of love at first sight. Vaik. (VI. 12 ) requires a brāhmaṇa bride to be a nagnikā or gauri, but does not prescribe the same qualification for a kṣatriya or vaisya bride. In the Harṣacarita princess Rajyasri is desoribed as quite grown-up at the time of her marriage which was consummated on the very day of marriage (vide the last para, of the 4th Ucchyāsa ). The Samskāra-prakasa 1060 expressly says that there is no prohibition against marrying a girl who has passed the age of puberty for ksatriyas and others. Even in Pauranio times grown-up unmarried girls must not have been unbeard of. The Gṛ. R. p. 83 quotes &amp; passage from the Brahmapurāpa where the injunction to observe complete deli.</p>

<p>Another important question is inter-caste marriages. It has already been shown ( pp. 50-58 ) how anuloma marriages were allowed, while pratiloma unions were condemned and how it was supposed that numerous sub-castes arose from such mixed marriages.</p>
<p>It is the contention of several eminent scholars (e. 8. Senart in his. Caste in India' translated by Ross p. 124 ) that caste as implied in modern usage and in its strict sense did not exist in the times of the Rgveda and the other Vedio Sambitas. We have seen, however, that the four varpas had been reco gnised in the times of the Samhitās and that ideas of superiority and inferiority due to being of a partioular varna had become quite prevalent. But the practices as to marrying outside one&rsquo;s varṇa and taking food had not become an rigid and cast-iron as they became in medieval times. A few clear examples of inter-caste marriages may be cited from the Vedio Literature. The Sat. Br. (IV.1.5, S. B. E. vol. 26, pp. 272-275) narrates the story of the old and decrepit sage Oyavana who Was &amp; Bhargava ( descendant of Bbṛgu ) or Angirasa to Sukanyā, the daughter of king Saryata, &amp; descendant of Manu. The Sat. Br. ( XIII. 2. 9. 8, 1068 S. B. E. vol. 44, p. 326 ) quotes a half Verse from the Vāj. 8. ( 26. 30 ) and then remarks therefore he does not anoint (as king) the son of the vaisya woman. This suggests that a king might marry &amp; vaisya girl, but her son would not have the Vedio coronation ceremony performed on him. Verses 17-19 of the Rgveda V. 61 are interpreted by the Bphad-devata (V. 50 ) as referring to the marriage of the brahmana sage Syāyāśva to the daughter of king Rathaviti Darbhya. The story of Kavaṣa Ailūṣa who was styled' dāsyāḥ putra' ( either meaning the son of a dasi or used as a term of abuse ) by the Bages has been mentioned above ( at p. 36).</p>

<p>History of Dharmaśāsira</p>
<p>C. IX</p>
<p>Turning to the dharma and gļhya sūtras, the matter stands thus. Some of the gṛbya sūtras (like Aśv., Ap.) do not expressly say anything about the varṇa of the bride. The Ap. Dh. S. 1083 (II. 6. 13. 1 and 3) requires tbat one should inarry a girl of the game varna, who was not given before to another and marriage with whom is in accordance with śāstra and says that by contre vening these rules sin is inourred. So he condemns mixed marria ges. The Mānava gr. I.7.8 and Gaut. IV.1 require that one should marry a girl of the same varna and are silent about marriages with a bride of another varna. But Gautama knew of such marriages and enumerates the names of several sub-castes due to mixed marriages (IV. 14-17) and he includes among those who are unfit to be invited at a śrāddha dinner a brābmaṇa who is the husband of &amp; woman of the sūdra caste (15.18). Manu (III. 12), Saṅkha and Nārada 1084 (stripumsa, v. 4) say that the best course is to marry a girl of one&rsquo;s own caste. This is said to be purva kalpa (the foremost or the best procedure). Many also speak of &amp; less advisable course (anukalpa, as it is called ) viz. that a brāhmaṇa may take as wife a woman of any caste, a ksatriya may marry a woman of his own caste or a vaisya or a sūdra woman, a vaisga may marry &amp; vaisya or sūdra woman and a sūdra only a sūdra woman. This is stated by Baud. Dh. S, I. 8. 2, Saṅkha, Manu III. 13, Vippu Dh. S. 24. 1-4. Pār. gr. I. 4 and Vas. Dh, S. 1065 I. 25 inform us that some teachers allowed a dvija to marry &amp; sūdra woman but without Vedio mantras. But Vasiṣtba himself condemns it severely by saying &lsquo;one should not do so (i. e. marry a śūdra girl), for by doing so the degradation of the family is certain and loss of heaven after death&rsquo;. Though the Viṣṇu Dh. S, and Manusmrti state that a dvijāti may marry a śūdra girl, that is not their own view, but they simply voice practices and sentiments prevalent in their time, since both denounce the marriage of a brābmapa with a sūdra girl in the most un-measured terms. Viṣnu Dh, S. 26. 5-6 (S. B. E. vol. 7 p. 112 ) says that the union of a dvijati with a sūdra woman can never produce religious</p>

<p>merit; it is from carnal desire alone that be marries her being blinded by lust; and that dvijāti men who thus marry sūdra women quickly degrade their families and progeny to the status of sūdras'. The ancient editor of the Manusmrti did not tolerate such marriages (though he gave expression to the common trend of view in III. 12-13) and condemns a dvijati&rsquo;s marriage with a śūdra woman in the strongest language (III. 15-19, Manu III. 15 being the same as Viṣnu Dh. S. 26.5) &lsquo;&amp; brāhmaṇa by having intercourse with a sūdra woman goes to hell and by procreating &amp; son on her he loses his status as a brahmana&rsquo;. Yāj. I. 57 allowed a brāhmaṇa or kṣatriya to marry a girl of his own varpa or of the varṇas next in order, but laid it down as his emphatic opinion that&rsquo;a dvijāti should not marry a sūdra girl'. It appears however that prevailing public opinion and practice was too much for both Manu and Yāj.; for, both declare ( Yāj. II. 125 and Manu IX. 152-153 ) that when a brāhmaṇa has sons from wives of the four varnas, the son of a brāhmaṇa wifo takes four shares (out of 10 in which his wealth is to be divided ), the son of a kṣatriya wife takes three, of a vaibya wife two and of a sūdra wife one. Yāj. ( I. 91-92 ) recognises the marriage of a brāhmaṇa with a śūdra and says that the son of such a union is &amp; pāraśava' Manu III. 44 also recognises the marriage of a śūdra girl with one of a higher class by saying that she holds the hem of the garment of a bridegroom of a higher class.</p>
<p>This shows that the ancient smrtis ungrudgingly recognised inarriages between a brābmapa and a ksatriya or ā vaisya girl. But opinion was not unanimous about the marriage of a dvijāti with a sūdra woman, Such marriages took place, but were looked upon with disfavour and often condemned with severity. Anuloma marriages were frequent enough till the 9th or 10th century A. D., but became rare later and for the last several hundred years they hardly ever took place or they were not at all recognized as valid by the communities concerned. The epigraphio records furnish well authenticated instances of intor-caste marriages. The Vākatakas were brāhmaṇas (their gotra being Viṣnuvžddha). The Poona plates of Prabb&amp;vatigupta (E. I. vol. 15 p. 39 ) establish that she was a daughter of Candragupta II. (first quarter of 5th century A. D.) of the Imperial Gupta dynasty and became the chief queen of the king Rudrasena II of the Vakataka line. The Talaguṇda pillar inscription of the Kadamba king Kakusthavarman ( E. I. vol. 8 p. 24) recites that</p>

<p>the founder of the Kadamba family was Mayūrasarman, a brāhmaṇa, who being exasperated with the Pallavas of Kañol took up the sword. His descendants have names ending in varman (as kṣatriyas should have, according to Manu II. 32 ). The inscrip tion mentions that Kakusthavarman ( who was 4th in descent from Mayūrassrman) got his daughters married to Gupta and other kings. In the Ghatotkaca Inscription of Yaśodharman and Viṣnuvardhana (A. S. W. I. vol. 4, p. 140 ) we are told that Soma, &amp; brāhmaṇa and ancestor of Hastibhoja, minister of the Vākāṭaka king Devasena, gave his heart to wives born in brāhmaṇ&amp; and kṣatriya families, The Tip perah copper-plate grant of a chieftain called Lokanatha (E. I. vol. 15, p. 301 ff) dated in the 44th year ( probably of the Harga era i. e. about 650 A. D.) says that Lokanātha&rsquo;s ancestors belonged to the Bharadvāja gotra (p. 306) and that the maternal grand-father of Lokanātha was Kesava who is said to have been a pāraśava (p. 307), wbile Keśava&rsquo;s father Vira was &amp; brāhmaṇa (dvijasattama). Virūpādevi, a daughter of the famous Vijayanagara king Bukka I (1268-1298 A. D. ), was married to &amp; brābmaṇa named Brabma or Bomanna Wodeya, who was the Governor of the Araga province ( E. I. vol. 15,p.12). Vide also E. I. vol. 18, p. 87 ( dated 894 of the Vikrama era ) for Pratibāra kings being descended from a brāhmana Hari candra and the latter&rsquo;s kṣatriya wife; the Ātpur Insoription of Śaktikumāra dated in sarnvat 1034 (977 A. D.) which states that the founder of the Gubila dynasty was a brāhmana Gubadatta, whose descendant Bhartspatta married a Rāṣtrakūta princess.</p>
<p>Classical Sanskrit Literature also yields certain well known instances of inter-caste marriages. The Malavikāgnimitrs of Kalidasa shows that Agnimitra, a son of Senapati Puṣya. mitra of the Sunga dynasty and a brāhmaṇa, married Malavika who was a kṣatriya princess. In the Harsacarita of Bāpa (Ucchvāsa I towards end) we are told by Bāṇa himself that among the friends and companions of his wanderings there were bis two pāraśava brothers Candrasena and Mātrṣeṇa (i.e. step-brothers froin a sūdra wife of his father). Rajasekhara, teacher of king Mahendrapala of Kanoj, says in his Karpūra mañjarl( I. 11 ) that his accomplished wife Avantisundarl was descended from the Cahuāṇa (modern Chavan) family (i. e. from a kṣatriya family ).</p>

<p>smrtis and writers of digests. Visvarūpa 5066 on Yāj. III. 283 ( not later than first half of 9th century ) olearly suggests that in his day a brahmana could marry a kṣatriya girl. Medha. tithi on Manu III. 14 suggests that about 900 A. D. at the latest marriages of brahmaṇas with kṣatriya and raisya girls took place rarely in his day, but not with sūdra women; and the Mito on Yaj. does not at all say that though marriages among dvijātis (anuloma ones) were allowed by Manu and Yaj, they had entirely ceased to be regarded as valid by its time. Many of the medieval digests and writers like the Sm. O. and Hemādri quote verses stated to be from the Aditya-purāṇa or Brahma-purāṇa on matters forbidden in the Kali age ( and so called Kalivariya) among which inter-caste marriages are inoluded.</p>
<p>The Āpagtambalo17 smrti (in verse ed. by Jivananda 1, p. 549, chap. IX) says that by marrying a girl of another caste a man incurred the sin of mahāpātaka and had to undergo the penance of 24 kṛoohras. The Mārkandeya-purāṇa (113. 34-36 ) narrates the story of king Nābhāga who married a vaisya girl by the rākṣaga form of marriage and who consequently incurred sin.</p>

<p>The state of the law as to inter-caste marriages in British Indian courts may be briefly indiosted here. By the Special Marriage Act ( III of 1872 as amended by Aot XXX of 1923 ) both anuloma and pratiloma marriages are validated if they are registered and solemnized according to the procedure prescribed by the Act. But if &amp; marriage is not so solemnized under that Act, but under the general rules of Hindu Law, then all pratiloina marriages are invalid throughout British India,</p>

<p>But anuloma 1068 marriages have been recognised as valid by some High Courts in India; the Allahabad High Court, however regards all anuloma marriages even as invalid.</p>
<p>The next restriction that the girl to be married must not be a sapiṇda of the bride-groom has now to be considered. Sapinda relationship is of special importance in three matters, viz. marriage, inheritance and āśauca 1068 (impurity on birth and death). The prohibition against marriage with a sapipda girl applies to all varṇas including the sūdra 1970. There are two schools about the meaning of sapiṇda, one represented by the Mitāksarā and the other by Jimūtavahana (author of the Dāyabhāga). Both are agreed that a sapinda girl cannot be married, but they differ as to the meaning of the word. We shall first understand one interpretation of sapiṇda. The locus classicus is the commentary of Vijñānesvara on Yāj. I. 52-53 a substantial portion of which is translated here : ** asapiṇ. dām' (in Yaj. I. 52 ) meang a woman who is not a sapinda and sapinda means one who has the same piṇda i, e. body (or particles of the body). Sapiṇda relationship (between two persons ) arises from (their) being connected by having partioles of the same body. Thus, the son has sapinda relationship with his father by reason of the ( fact that ) particles of the father&rsquo;s body oontinue in him (the son).

Thus (&amp; person has sapinda relationship) with his mother&rsquo;s father through his mother; 80 (one has sapiṇdatā) with one&rsquo;s mother&rsquo;s sister or mother&rsquo;s brother also by reason of the connection with (or continuity of) particles of the same body (viz. the body of the naternal grandfather). So also (a person has sapiṇdatā) with the paternal uncle, the paternal aunt and the like. Similarly the wife has sapinda rolationship with the busband because she produces ( with the husband) one body (viz. their son). 1071 In the same way brother&rsquo;s wives (are sapiṇdas) of each other, because they produce one body ( viz. their respective sons ) with their respective husbands who are produced from one body (viz. their busbands' father). In this manner wherever the word sapiṇda ooours, there one has to understand connection with (or continuity of)</p>

<li>The words . UT 979T RETETYT TCTT1977are translated differently by Golap Chandra Sarkar in his Hindu Law (7th od. of 1936 ) pp. 81-82 as &lsquo;similarly arises tho sapinda relationsbip of the husband with the lawfully wedded wife by reason of their togethor) forming one body&rsquo;(i. o. one person, bence the wife is called half the body of the husband). The learned author thinks that his translation is the correct one and others went wrong in translating as in the passago above. His translation oan not be accepted for several roas008. In the first place, it is opposed to the explanation of the Baļambbatti SITTHwafa TOTEU artit Tutarref: (i, e. particles of tho bodies of the husband and wife continue in or are concerned with one body, the son, that is produced by them both). Tbat husband and wifo are one is a pleasant fiction but here Vijñanodvara is stressing the physical continuity of particlos. The husband and wifo though said to be ono are still two bodies. No one says that their bodies become physically one. Besides the objection that if thoy do not beget a son, the husband and wife will not be sapiṇdas is not sound. Rules and principles are laid down for generality of cases and regard is to be had to their capacity to produce a 800. The forcing (III. q . p. 280) shows that G. C. Sarkar is wrong &lsquo;Tento rochtaart CITRATE 49 go पौत्रादिषुसाक्षात् परंपरा पा शुक्रशोणितादिरूपेणावस्यूताः । पचपिपल्या पत्यासह भ्रात पत्नीनां च परस्परं नैतत्संभवति तथापि आधारवेकशरीरावयवान्दयोऽस्येव ।। A woman&rsquo;s busband&rsquo;s brother&rsquo;s wifo is the receptacle ( Adhara ) for a son who is procreated by the husband&rsquo;s brother and his wifo, the former of whom has partioles of his father whose particles continue in the husband of the woman.</li>

<p>partioles of the same body either direotly or mediately. 1071 On the word &lsquo;asapiṇdām&rsquo; it was explained that sapiṇda rela tionship arises immediately or mediately by reason of the conneo tion with partioles of the same body; this may prove to be too wide a statement, since in this beginningless sansāra, such a rela. tionship might exist in some way or other between all men; 1978 therefore ( the sage Yajñavalkya) states&rsquo; after the fifth on the mother&rsquo;s side and after the 7th on the father&rsquo;s side. After the fifth on the mother&rsquo;s side i. e. in the mother&rsquo;s line and after the 7th on the father&rsquo;s side 1. e. in the father&rsquo;s line sapinda relationship ceases. These words ( viz sapiṇda &hellip; &hellip; Deases) are to be taken as understood ( in the text of Yaj.). Therefore the word &lsquo;sapiṇda&rsquo; though it applies everywhere (i. e. to a very wide circle of persons ) by the expressive (i. e. literal) power of its component parts, is restricted to a certain definite sphere, like the words nirmanthya' 10%* and &lsquo;pankaja&rsquo;. And so the six ( ascendants ) beginning with the father and the six descendants beginning with the son and the man himself as the seventh ( in each case ) are sapiṇdas; wherever there is &amp; divergence of the line, the counting shall be made until the seventh in descent is reached including him (i, e. the ancestor ) from whom the line diverges; in this way the computation is to be made everywhere. And so the fifth ( if a girl ), who stands in the fifth generation when a computation is made beginning with the mother and going up to her ( mother&rsquo;s ) father, mother&rsquo;s paternal grandfather &amp;c., is styled in an indirect way &lsquo;fifth</p>

<p>from the mother&rsquo;s side' (by Yaj.). In the same way the seventh from the father&rsquo;s side' (in Yāj.).is she who is the seventh in degree (from an ancestor) when computation is made beginning from the father and proceeding up to the father&rsquo;s father and so on&rdquo;. . According to this explanation of the Mitaksara 1075 the following rules about prohibition based on sāpiṇdy&amp; follow: (1) In computing degrees the common ancestor is to be included; (2) regard is to be had to the fatber and mother of the bride and bridegroom both; (3) if computation is made from the mother&rsquo;s side of either the proposed bride or bride groom, they must be beyond the fifth degree (i. e. they must be 6th or further on) from the common ancestor and if it is made through the father of either, they must be beyond the seventh from the common ancestor ( i. e. they must be eighth &amp;c.). This last postulates four different classes of cages, viz. descent from a common ancestor may be traced through the fathers of both bride and bridegroom or through the mother of both, or through the mother of the bridegroom and the father of the bride or through the father of the bride groom and the mother of the bride. The method of computing degrees is entirely different from the English method as is made clear by the remarks of the Mit. translated above. The rules require that both must be beyond sapiṇda relationship as defined and limited above. For example, tracing descent through the fathers of both bride and bridegroom, if the bride is 8th from the common ancestor ( called kūļastha in dharmaśāstra works ) and the bridegroom is 6th, there can be no marriage, as though the bride is beyond the limits of sapiṇda relationship to the common ancestor, the bridegroom being 6th from the kūtastha has sapiṇda relationship with the kūtastha. These rules apply according to the Mit. only where the ancestors married women of their own varṇa. But if an ancestor married a brahmana girl and also a kṣatriya girl and a question arose about the eligibility of marriage among descendants of these two wives, then prohibition based on sapiṇda relationship extends up to only three degrees (and not seven or five ). 10754</p>

<p>It should not be supposed that these rules of the Mit. are universally observed. The texts themselves are in conflict, Further, the customs and usages as to prohibited degrees for marriage are so divergent in the various parts of India and among the hundreds of castes and sub-castes that it is impossible to state any rule as universally or even generally applicable. A few examples of conflict among the smrtis are cited by the Mit. itself. Vas. Dh. S. (8.2) says &lsquo;(he may marry ) the fifth on the mother&rsquo;s side and 7th on the father&rsquo;s side&rsquo;, while Yāj. as interpreted by the Mit. makes it necessary that the girl to be eligible must be 6th from the common ancestor traced through the mother and 8th when traced through the father. Paighinasi says the girl must be beyond three degrees on the mother&rsquo;s 1070 side and five degrees on the father&rsquo;s side'. These two are explained away by the Mit. by saying that these texts do not authorise a marriage with &amp; girl who is distant from the common ancestor by a legger number of degrees than those propounded by Yāj. but they only prohibit marriage with girls who are nearer in degrees than those stated in those texts. But this reconciliation of the conflict among the smrtis is not at all satisfactory.</p>
<p>The following diagrams illustrate the application of the rules of sapiṇda relationship according to the Mitakṣarā. In all of them A represents the cominon ancestor and the letters Sand D represent respectively sons and daughters. According to the Mit. computation has to be made from ( and inclusive of ) the common ancestor in all cases and both the bride and bride groom have to be beyond the prohibited degrees. 1077</p>

<p>sapiṇda relationship by &lsquo;frog&rsquo;s leap,1018 Just as a frog leaps from one spot to another leaving intervening objects untouobed, 80 in this example No. 3, there is sāpiṇdy&amp; between D(5) and D(5), but 8(6) and D(6) are left unaffected by sāpindya ( as relationship is traced through the mothers of both ), while sāpiṇdya reverts to affect D(7) and 8(?). The maxim of * frog&rsquo;s leap is a very ancient one, being exemplified by the Mahābhāṣya of Patafjali.1079</p>
<p>The rules about prohibition of marriage on the ground of sapiṇda relationship, particularly where cognates (persons oonnected through females) were concerned, have not been observed in numerous instances over wide areas from very ancient times. One striking illustration is the question whe ther a man can marry his maternal unole&rsquo;s or his paternal aunt&rsquo;s daughter, particularly the former. On this point opinion has been sharply divided from ancient times. Ap. Dh. 8. 1. 7. 21. 8 includes among pataniya actions (mortal sins) sexual intercourse with the uterine relations ( mothers and sisters ) of one&rsquo;s parents and their children. This would prohibit marriage with one&rsquo;s maternal uncle&rsquo;s or paternal aunt&rsquo;s daughter, Baud. Dh. S. I.1080 1. 19-26 notes that there were five practices peculiar to the south viz. eating in the company of one whose upanayana has not been performed, to eat in the company of one&rsquo;s wife, to eat stale food, to marry the daughter of the maternal uncle or of &amp; paternal aunt and there were five practices peculiar to the north. Then he proceeds to state the argument that those who follow the practices mentioned by him in countries other than those where they prevail incur sin, that Gautama (XI. 20) holds this last argument to be wrong and then Baud. states his own</p>

<p>Marriage with maternal uncle&rsquo;s daughter</p>
<p>459</p>
<p>view that one should pay no heed to either set of practices, as both are opposed to smrtis and the views of śiṣtas. - From this it is olear that a marriage with one&rsquo;s maternal uncle&rsquo;s daughter or paternal aunt&rsquo;s daughter was in vogue in the south ( below the Narmada probably) long before the Baud. Dh. S. (1. e. several centuries before the Christian ora ) and that North India did not go in for such marriages and that orthodox sutra writers like Gautama and Baudbāyana reprobated such practices. Manu (XI. 172-173 ) forbids such marriages &quot; on approaching (for carnal intercourse ) the daughter of one&rsquo;s father&rsquo;s sister or of one&rsquo;s mother&rsquo;s sister or of mother&rsquo;s full brother, a man must undergo the penance called &lsquo;cāndrāyana&rsquo;. A wise man should not take as his wife (any one of ) these; they are not fit to be wedded because they are (sapinda ) relatives, for by wodd. ing them one sinks low ( i. e. falls into hell or loses caste)&rdquo;. Haradatta on Ap. Dh. S. II. 5. 11. 16 quotes &amp; verse from Sātātapa 1981 prescribing the penance of candrāyaṇa for marrying one&rsquo;s maternal uncle&rsquo;s daughter or a girl having the same gotra as one&rsquo;s mother&rsquo;s gotra (i. e. maternal grandfather&rsquo;s gotra ) or &amp; sapravara girl and a text of Sumantu forbidding marriage with the daughter of the brother of one&rsquo;s mother or step-mother. It would be seen that all these relatives are third from the common ancestor and so are very much within the probibition against marrying &amp; sapiṇda, whatever be the number of prohibited degrees for marriage that are accepted. Kumārila in his Tantravārtika while discussing the scope and validity of sadācāra ( on Jaimini I.3.7) enumerates many lapses from good conduct attributed to great men and heroes of the past and tries to explain away those violations of good conduct. The cbarge brought against Vāsudeva (Krsns) and Arjuna, the central heroes of the Mahābhārata, is that they respectively married Rukmini and Subhadrā who were their maternal uncle&rsquo;s daughters ( this being forbidden). Kumārila makes very soathing remarks against this practice 10% prevalent among southerners and then refutes this charge by saying that although in the Mahabharata (Adiparva 219. 17–18) Subhadra is described as the daughter of</p>

<p>Vasudeva and sister 1083 of Krṣṇa, she was really not 89, but that she was Vāsudeva&rsquo;s mother&rsquo;s sister&rsquo;s daughter or was the daughter&rsquo;s daughter of the sister of the father of Vasudeva&rsquo;s mother (or step-mother Rohini ).1086 Kumārila argues that such female cousins one degree or Beveral degrees removed are often spoken of as sisters. Vide my notes to the Vyavahāramayūkha pp. 200-202 where this matter is fully explained. This reply of Kumārila well illustrates the method of dealing with inconvenient texts adopted by msmāṁsakas like Kumārila when the texts run coun ter to their cherished views. Viśvarūpa on Yāj. III. 254 quotes Manu XI. 172 and verses of Samyarta prescribing the penance of Parāka for carnal intercourse with one&rsquo;s maternal unole&rsquo;s daughter. 1085 Medbātithi on Manu II. 18 refers to this practioe as prevalent in some countries, and says it is opposed to the rule of Gautama (IV. 3 ) about probibition on the ground of sāpindya and explains how such practices might have arisen. Persons making love to the handsome daughters of their maternal uncles married them for fear that they might otherwise be punished by the king; it may be that others literally following the words of Manu IV. 178 held by the practice which their fore fathers resorted to for fear of punishment. 1086 Among medieval writers, some condemn this practice, others justify it. Aparārka (pp. 82-84 ) after a lengthy discussion condemns marriage with maternal unole&rsquo;s daughter, The Nirnayasindhu also does the same (p. 286 ).</p>
<p>Among those who support marriage with a maternal uncle&rsquo;s daughter the most prominent are the Sm. C. ( I. pp. 70-74) and the Par. M. (1. 2. pp. 63-68). They both admit that there are</p>

<p>Marriage with maternal uncle&rsquo;s daughter</p>

<p>passages of Manu, Sātātapa, Sumantu (all quoted above) and others condemning marriage with a maternal uncle&rsquo;s daughter, yet they say that there are passages of the Veda and some smstis in support of it and sistas (learned and respect able persons ) observe this practice and 80 such marriages are sadācāra and not forbidden. They rely upon two Vedlo passages; one is from the Sat. Br. I. 8. 3. 6 (S. B. E. vol. XII. p. 238 ) &quot; thus the separation ( of the eater and the eaten ) is effected in one and the same act; hence from one and the same man spring both the enjoyer (the husband) and the enjoyed ( the wife); for now kinsfolk live sporting and rejoicing together saying in the fourth or tbird man (generation ) we shall unite&rsquo;. And this is so in accordance with that (separa tion of the spoons ).&rdquo; 1087 The mention of the union in the third generation is understood by the Sm. C. 88 referring to the marriage of a person with his maternal uncle&rsquo;s or paternal aunt&rsquo;s daughter. Visvarapa also refers to this passage ( on Yaj. 1.53), but he does not draw the inference that such marriages are authorized by the Veda. Another Vedic verse is relied upon by the Sm. O. and Par. M and other works. It is a verse from a Khila sūkta Come, 0 Indra, by commended paths to this our sacrifice and partake of your portion. They (the priests ) have offered the fat seasoned with ghee that is thy portion, as the maternal uncle&rsquo;s daughter or the paternal aunt&rsquo;s daughter (is one&rsquo;s lot in marriage ) 1088 This verse is referred to by Visvarūpa on Yāj.( I. 53 ) but his explanation of it is different viz. that it really indicates one out of four different alternatives</p>

<p>as regards prohibited degrees for marriage.1089 Aparārka (p. 83) on Yaj. I. 53 reads the latter balf somewhat differently and 80 interprete it as to spell out of it a prohibition against marrying a maternal uncle&rsquo;s daughter. This text is quoted in I. L. R. 7 Mad. 548 at p. 550. The Smrtio:ndrikā relies upon &amp; passage of the Caturvimsatimata that allows a marriage of persons who are third or fourth in descent from a common ancestor on both sides (on the mother&rsquo;s or father&rsquo;s side ). There is also a text of Bphaspati which presoribes that the practices of the countries, castes and families should be guarded (or enforced) by the king as they have been in vogue from past times, otherwise the subjects becoine inflamed and among buch practices he instances &lsquo;Brāhmaṇas in the south marry the maternal uncle&rsquo;s daughter. 1090 So there is smrti authority for Buch marriages. Besides southern śistas deeply read in the Vedas and acting according to the meaning of the Veda prac tise marriage with a maternal uncle&rsquo;s daughter. Here both Sm. C. and Par. M. are on very firm ground. The Smrtimuktāphala of Vaidyanātha bays&rsquo; among the Andhras sistas deeply read in the Vedas follow the practice of mālulasulā-pariṇayana and among the Dravidas respectable people allow marriage of &amp; person with a girl who is fourth in descent from the common ancestor&rsquo;,1031 Among several castes in the Dacoan and the Madras Presidenoy, not only is marriage with a maternal uncle&rsquo;s daughter allowed, but it is highly commended. Even certain brābmapa castes like the Desastha brāhmaṇas of the Karnataka and Karbādā brāhmaṇas observe this practice in modern times. The Samskārakaustubha (pp. 616-620 ) and the</p>

<p>Both the Sm. O. and Par. M. say that though the Vedic passage from the Satapatba is a mere arthavāda ( a laudatory statement) in praise of &amp; Vedio act, yet on the analogy of the words &lsquo;he holds ( the samidb ) above the sruo) for gods&rsquo;, which</p>

<p>Cross-cousin Marriages</p>

<p>are construed by Jaimini ( III. 4. 15 ) 88 a vidhi (as &amp; positive rule) on socount of their apūrvatva ( not being known from any other source ), these words of the Satapatha are also to be con strued as a vidhi ( of the marriage with maternal uncles daughter ). 1098 The Sm. C. also pregaes into service the Vedio verso ( Rg. X. 16, 5 ) addressed by Yami to Yama. But that mantra does not clearly refer to cross-cousin marriages.</p>
<p>The smrti pasgages that condemn cross-cousin marriages are explained in a peculier manner by the Sm, C. and the Par. M. When a woman is married in one of the four forms, brāhma &amp;c., she passes into the gotra of her husband, becomes &amp; sapiṇda in the husband&rsquo;s family and so she is revered from her father&rsquo;s family (as to gotra and sapiṇda relationship); but when a woman is married in the asura, gāndharva and other forms, she does not pass over into the gotra of her husband, but remains in the gatra of the father and her sapiṇda relationship with her father and brother continues. Therefore the son of such a woman, if he marries the daughter of his mother&rsquo;s brother, would be marrying a girl who is &amp; Bagotra and sapinda of his mother. The Sm. C. and the Par, M. and other works say that the smrti texts forbidding marriage with maternal unole&rsquo;s daughter refer to a person whose mother was married in the gāndbarva, asura and the other two forms, but not to a person whose mother was married in the brahma and the three other approved forms.</p>
<p>This is the reasoning of the Sm, C. and the Par. M.1093</p>
<p>1092, Jaimini&rsquo;a satra is feftat rostera III.4.15. This is not com mented upon by Sabara ; but the Tantravārtika, wbich poticos this fact, assigns several reasons for tbis omission and explains it as follows: in the au t hore is a passage TURPIENTAU UNTY</p>
<p>anti vir oft. In the homa for pilis the samidh is beld bolow the sruc in which the havis bas boon placed ; in tbis passage it is said that when tho oblation is to be offered to tho gods the sainidh is to be held over tbo sruo (in wbich the oblation is placod before boing thrown into the fire). Hero though the particle bi&rsquo; (slowing reason) is einployed and tbougl, the prosent &lsquo;dbarayati&rsquo; is used (and not the potential as is usual in ridhis), it is not a more arthavada but a vidhi. So also in the Bat. Br. thore is a vidhi about matula-suta parinayana.'

<p>These rules about probibition on the ground of sapinda relationship cause great difficulties in modern times, when owing to the rapid spread of co-education and the rise in the marriageable age of girls, love marriages have become some what frequent. Lovers do not stop to consider such (to them ) trivial matters as sapiṇda relationship, but the law is often inexorable. The narrowing of the limits of sapipda relationship is permitted by the authors of commentaries and digests only on the ground of immemorial family, caste or local usage. For example, the same authors, who hold that marriage with the maternal uncle&rsquo;s daughter is sanctioned by Vedio texts and custom, condemn and forbid marriage with one&rsquo;s paternal aunt&rsquo;s daughter or with one&rsquo;s maternal aunt&rsquo;s daughter (vide below ). There are a few Verees oited from the smptis which favour the narrowing down of sapinda relationship. For example, the Caturvimsatimata 08?« states' According to Sākaṭāyana there is no blame in marrying a girl wbo is 7th or 6th or 5th (from the common ancestor); similarly Manu, Pārāśarya, Yams and Angiras say that one may marry a girl who is third or fourth (from the common ancestor) on both sides (i. e. from her father&rsquo;s side or mother&rsquo;s side). Whoever enters into such marriage alliances by relying on the usage of bis country or of his family is always entitled to associate with people and this is seen from the Veda'. Parāśara (as quoted in the Nirṇayasindhu and other works ) says a man who is himself fourth or fifth (from the common ancestor ) may according to Parāśara&rsquo;s view marry a girl who is 4th or 6th (from the common ancestor ), but one who is himself fifth cannot marry a girl who is also fifth (from the common ancestor). The Samskārakaustubha, the Sāpindyadipika and a few digests hold these verses authorita tive and allow such marriages provided they are in accordance with local or family usage. As against this the following facts have to be remembered. One of the maxims of interpretation is that where there is conflict between smști texts, the preferable rule is to follow the opinion of the majority.10986 Gaut., Manu,</p>

<p>Marriage-sapinda relationship</p>
<p>465</p>
<p>Yaj, Marloi and numerous other smptikaras are opposed to these diota. The second rule is that Manu has the highest authority among smptis and that smrti which is opposed to the dicta of Manu is not commended.10934 The above passages are opposed to the words of Manu on sapiṇda relationship and about marry. ing a maternal uncle&rsquo;s daughter ( Manu V. 60, III. 5, XI. 171 172). A third point about the above texts is that several eminent works like the Nirnayasindhu and the Dharmasindhu 10888 hold that some of these Verses are baseless and not genuine and that they really refer to persons adopted or persons des cended from wives of different castos of the same common ancestor; and lastly even those works that support such narrow ing of sapinda relationship for marriage do not advocate it for all and sundry, but only where there is &amp; local or family Ugage to that affect. Therefore, marriages among persons who are 3rd or 4th or 5th from the common ancestor cannot be regarded as valid in general, but only on the ground of usage. The following diagram will furnish some examples of the narrowing down of sapiṇda relationship.</p>

It should be noted that even under the Special Marriage Act ( III of 1872) marriage between D (4) and S (4) or 8 (5)</p>

<p>will not be valid according to the 2nd proviso to sec. %. The Nirnayasindhu 1083 * was not prepared to concede that such marriages, though not the best, were at least allowable as inferior (anukalpa). The Dharmasindhu 1093! stated that only in calamities when one is unable to secure a girl one may enter into &amp; marriage where sapiṇde relationship is narrowed down, but that those who can secure another girl should not go in for it, as the sin of incest would be incurred. Such marriages did not take place except during the last few years and so the courts have not yet pronounced on their validity. The preceding remarks are made by way of caution only and it is quite possible that courts may find out some way to uphold the marriages when they come before them many years after their celebration. But it is well to remember that the validity of such marriages in oastes that have no usage to that effect is, to say the least, doubtful.</p>
<p>There is a great 1094 deal of discussion in the smrtis and nibandhas on the gotra of a woman. Aśv. gr. 8. I. 8. 12 is interpreted by some as laying down that husband and wife become of one gotra one year after marriage. Laghu Harita appears to refer to this and also proposes an option that she takes up the husband&rsquo;s gotra immediately after marriage. Yama 86 and Likbita 25 say that after marriage on the 4th night a bride becomes one with her husband as to gotra, pinda and āśauca ; while Yama 78 and Likhita 26 state that she loses her father&rsquo;s gotra on taking the seventh step. The Mit. on Yaj. I. 254 has a long note on this subject, states that there are two views and finally reaches the conolusion that a woman retains her father&rsquo;s gotra even after marriage for pindadāna, if she was &amp; putrikā or wag married in the Āgura and the following forms ; but if she was married in the brāhma and other approved</p>

<p>forms, there was an option viz. pinda may be offered to one&rsquo;s mother by one&rsquo;s father&rsquo;s gotra or by her father&rsquo;s gotra acoording to family usage. Vide also Aparārka pp. 432, 542, Sm. C.</p>

<p>Both of them allow a person&rsquo;s marriage with his paternal aunt&rsquo;s daughter. Certain inscriptions at Nāgārjunikonda (of about the 3rd century A. D.) establish that the king Siri Virapu risadata, son of Siri Cbāntamūla who had performed the Vājapeya, Aśvamedha and other sacrifices, married &amp; daughter of his paternal aunt ( E. I. vol. 20 at p. 4). There are other authors, however, who, while allowing marriage with a maternal unole&rsquo;s daughter, disallow it with &amp; paternal aunt&rsquo;s daughter, For example, the Nirnayasindhu says that, though it follows from the same Vedic passages that one&rsquo;s paternal aunt&rsquo;s daughter may be married, yet such a marriage should not be contracted as it is hateful to the people, as there are no other passages laying down the advisability of such marriages. 9o95 Similarly the Sm. O. (I. p.71 ) and Par. M.( I. 2. p. 65 ) say that though marriage with one&rsquo;s mother&rsquo;s sister or mother&rsquo;s sister&rsquo;s daughter also should be allowed on the same grounds as those urged in favour of the marriage with the maternal uncle&rsquo;s daughter, yet it is forbidden since it is condemned by sistas and is hateful to the people and both again rely on Yāj. I. 156,1096</p>
<p>Another and a very striking instance of the limits of sapiṇda relationship not being observed is the practice among certain seotions of even brāhinanas ( such as some Deśasthas in Karnataka and Mysore ) marrying their own sister&rsquo;s daughter (i.e. their own niece ). Vide Mandlik&rsquo;s Hindu Law p. 425. In Ramangavda v.

<p>such marriages was alleged 1097. In Vellanki Ramakrishna v. Kotagiri Subbamma 13 Mad. 830 at p. 834 it is stated that in the Velama caste a man may marry his sister&rsquo;s daughter.</p>
<p>On account of these disergenoes about the limits of probi. bited dogrces for marriage it appears that the remarks of the Sarhskārakaustubha (p. 620) and of the Dharmasindhu (p. 228) are most sensible and practical. They say that even in the Kali age 1098 those, in whose families or countries the limits of sapiṇda relationship are narrowed down and marriage with the maternal uncle&rsquo;s daughter has been in vogue for ages, may do so, that they incur no blame by such marriages, that others (among whom there is no such custom) may without blame invite such persons for sraddhas and may take girls from their families in marriage and that the passages quoted by Hemādri forbidding their being invited at śrāddhas only apply to those who marry a maternal uncle&rsquo;s daughter even though they have</p>
<p>no such family or local usage.1039</p>
<p>Another question is how far sapinda relationship holds good in the case of girls belonging to the family from which one&rsquo;s step-mother comes. The Udvāhatattva (p. 118), the Nirnayasindhu (p. 289), the Sam. Pr. (pp.695-699), Samskara Kaustubha (pp. 621-630) and the Dharmasindhu (p. 230) deal with this matter. They all rely on a text of Sumantu &ldquo;100 &lsquo;all the wives of one&rsquo;s father are mothers, the brothers of these are one&rsquo;s maternal unoles, their sisters are one&rsquo;s mother&rsquo;s sisters, the daughters of these are one&rsquo;s sisters and the children of these</p>

<p>latter are one&rsquo;s sister&rsquo;s children; otherwise there would be samkara ( confusion)&rsquo;. Two interpretations are placed on this, one view (and that is held by most ) is that this lays down sāpindya only with the persons specifically mentioned, hoi whilo another view (this is held by the Sam. Pr.) is that there is sāpindya for four generations from the father of one&rsquo;s step mother. According to the first view a man cannot marry the daughter or grand-daughter of his step-mother&rsquo;s brother or sister, but his own daughter can marry the son of his step mother&rsquo;s brother; while according to the second view the latter marriage also would contravene the rule about this extension (alidesa) of sāpiṇdya.</p>
<p>Marriages with certain girls were forbidden by certain writers on the ground of what is called &lsquo;viruddhasainbandha &lsquo;, although there is no question of sapiṇda relationship in such cases. The Ghya-parisista &lsquo;108 ( quoted in the Nirnayasindhu p. 289) prescribes &lsquo;one should marry a girl with whom there is no viruddhasambandha, e.g, the daughter of one&rsquo;s wife&rsquo;s sister or the sister of one&rsquo;s paternal uncle&rsquo;s wife (these should not be married), Viruddhasambandha (incompatible relation ) occurs where the standing of the proposed bridegrooin and the bride would resemble that of father or mother to the other (or of brother and sister). In modern times such marriages take place as a matter of course and no court would declare them to be invalid. Vide I. L. R. 20 Mad. 283 and I. L. R. 43 Mad. 830 where marriage with one&rsquo;s wife&rsquo;s sister&rsquo;s daughter was held to be valid, among brāhiapas as well as sūdras in the Telugu and Tamil distriots, relying on Mandlik&rsquo;s Hindu Law pp. 484-485 and other autho rities. In Ramchandra v. Gopal 32 Bom. 619 at pp. 630-631 the court approves of the decision in 20 Mad, 283 and holds that the dicta as to viruddha-sambandha are only recommendatory,</p>

<p>History of Dharmasastra</p>
<p>i Ch. IX</p>
<p>About the sapinda relationship of the adopted son as regards marriage, asauoa and graddha a good deal is said in many works such as Sam, K. (pp. 182-186 ), Nirnayasindhu (pp. 290-291 ), the Vyavabāramayūkba, the Sarn, Pr. (pp. 688-694 ), Sam. R. M. (pp. 453-456 ). Sāpiṇdya for āśauca and frāddba will be dealt with later on. As to sāpipdya for marriage in the case of adoption there is great divergence of views. The Sam. Pr. (p. 690) says that the son given in adoption has sāpindya for seven genera tions with his genitive father and for three generations with the adoptive father (pp. 693-694 ).&ldquo;103 The Sam, K. appears to hold, after quoting several views, that if the upanayang of the adopted boy was performed in the family of birth, then he has sāpindya with the genitive family for seven generations. But if the ceremonies from jātakarma to upanayana are performed in the adoptive family then he has sāpindya in the adoptive family for seven generations, but only for five generations if only upanayana is performed in the family of adoption. The Nirnayasindhu gives its own view that thers is sāpindya in both families for seven generations. The Vyavahāramayūkha holds ( following Gautama IV. 3 ) that in the case of kevala dattaka (the ordinary adopted son) sapinda relationship extends to seven degrees in the adoptive father&rsquo;s family and five degrees in the adoptive mother&rsquo;s family. 1104 The Dharma sindhu follows the Sam. 6. generally but it makes one significant remark. It says that several writers hold that in the case of dattaka, sāpiṇdya is to be observed for a lesser number of degrees (than seven or five ) in both families.&ldquo;105 The Samn, R. M.(p. 454 ) says that the limits of sāpiṇdya spoken of as applying to an adopted person extend to his children also. &ldquo;106 As the limits of sāpindya for marriage are very muoh narrowed down when marriage with one&rsquo;s maternal unolo&rsquo;s daughter or one&rsquo;s niece is allowed, on the other hand certain communities extend such limits too much.

Manu III. 5 lays down *that girl who is not a sapiṇda of the motber (of the bridegroom) and who is not a sagotra of the father of the bridegroom ) is commended in the case of twice-born classes&rsquo;. Many com mentators and digests like Kullūka, the Madana-pārijāta (p. 132), the Dipakalikā, the Udvābatattva (p. 107 ) understand the word asagotra (in Manu III. 5 ) after matuh&rsquo; also, and thus forbid marriage with a girl whose gotra is the same as that of one&rsquo;s mother (i. e, of one&rsquo;s maternal grandfather). Medhātithi 1107 on Manu III. 5 quotes &amp; text of Vasiṣtha which prescribes the penance of candrāyana for marrying a girl who has the same gotra as the bridegroom&rsquo;s mother ( i.e. his mother&rsquo;s father) and abandonment of her. Haradatta on Ap. Dh. S. II. 5. 11. 16 quotes a similar verse from Sātātapa. Kullūka, the Sun. O. (I. p. 69 ), Haradatta on Āp. Dh. S. II. 5. 11. 16, the Gr. R. (p. 10), Udvahatattva p. 107 and other digests quote a verse of Vyāsa&rsquo; some do not desire for marriage a girl who has the same gotra as one&rsquo;s mother; but one may marry without question (or fear) a girl when her birth and name (as connected with one&rsquo;s mother&rsquo;s original gotra ) are unknown&rsquo;. A woman on marriage loses her original gotra and passes over into the gotra of her husband; 80 the words &lsquo;sagotra&rsquo; of the mother simply mean &ldquo;having the same gotra as one&rsquo;s mother once had in her maiden state&rsquo;. The Sm. C. (I. p. 69 ) takes this Verse to refer only to a woman who was made an appointed daughter (putrikā) by her father. Halā yudha also hold the same view. But other writers do not approve of this ( vide the Gr. R., p. 10). The Nirnayasiadbu 1108 (III. pūrvārdha p. 302 ) forbids marriage with a girl who is sagotra of one&rsquo;s mother, but the sam. K. (p. 693 ) and the Dharmasindhu both say, after quoting a text of Satyāṣadha, that this restriction applies only to those who study the Madhyan. dina sākha.</p>

<p>Rasta word sapinda is that is offered interpretation</p>
<p>The Bengal school represented by the Dayabhāga and Raghunandana differ from the Mitakṣarā in the interpretation of the word &lsquo;sapinda&rsquo;. In this system the word &lsquo;piṇda&rsquo; is taken to mean &lsquo;the ball of rice&rsquo; that is offered in sraddhas to deceased ancestors &amp;o. (while under the Mit. interpretation &lsquo;pinda&rsquo; means body or partioles of body ). Sapiṇda means &lsquo;one who is connected with another through oblations of food&rsquo;. The author of the Dayabhaga propounds his theory with reference to inheri. tance and he himself says that with reference to aśauca 1109 sapiṇda relationship is to be differently understood. Further Jimūtavāhana does not set forth his theory of sapiṇda relation ship with reference to marriage. His theory is that in matters of inheritance the guiding principle is the spiritual benefit ( upa kārakatva ) conferred on the deceased through oblations of food, and be relies on Manu (IX. 106) for this proposition. For his sapiṇda theory he principally relies on two passages, Baud. 1110 Dh. 8. I. 5. 113-115 and Manu IX. 186-187, Baudhayana&rsquo;s words are the paternal great-grand-father, the paternal grand father, the father, the man himself, his full brothers, his son, grandson and son&rsquo;s son from a woman of the same varpa: all these participating in undivided daya (heritage ) are called gapindag. Those who participate in divided daya are called sakulyas. Thus issue of the body existing, wealth goes to them; on failure of sapiṇdas, the sakulyas&rsquo;. The text of Manu (IX. 186-187) is &lsquo;To three, libations of water must be given; towards three pinda proceeds; the fourth is the giver of these (of water and pindas ), there is no fifth properly (concerned in this). Whoever is the nearest among sapiṇdas, his becomes the wealth of him (who dies). After him the sakulya be comes (the heir) &amp;o. Jimūtavahana&rsquo;s explanation of this text is as follows: &lsquo;A man when living offers piṇdas to his three male ancestors ; but when he himself dies, his son performs</p>

Thus those to whom he offers piṇdas and those who offer pindas to him are called, since they share in undivided oblations, avibhaktadāyāda sapiṇdas. Several objections can be raised against the theory of Jimātavāhana. In the first place he assigns the meaning of pinda to the word dāya in Baudhāyana&rsquo;s passage for which there is no warrant. Baudbāyana really means tbat those enumerated by him are called sapiṇdas who take undivided wealth i. e. who constitute an undivided family. In the next place on his interpretation the word sapinda has to be interpreted in entirely different ways for āśauoa and marriage. Besides he himself is not sure of his ground, since he says that although learned men may not approve of his theory that spiritual benefit is the guiding principle in taking property by inheritance they must admit that the order of heirs as stated by him relying on Manu IX. 186-187 is the proper one. &ldquo;18</p>

<p>I Ch. IX</p>
<p>Śrikṭspa, a commentator of the Dāyabhaga and author of Dayakramasamgraha, and Raghunandana, author of Smptitattva, and others elaborate these rules. The Full Bench of the Caloutta High Court in Guru Govind Shaha Mandal 1118 v. Anand Lal Ghose Mazumdar gives an elaborate statement of the geveral sapiṇdas. But as those rules have reference only to succession, they are passed over here. Raghunandana in his work on marriage called Udvābatattva &ldquo;14 quotes the famous verse of the Matsyapurāṇa, &lsquo;the fourth and (two beyond him) among ascendants are partakers of lepa ( the leavings of the boiled rice that become attached to the hand of him who offers pindas ), the father and the rest( i. e. two more beyond bim ) are partakers of the pinda; he who offers the piṇda to them is the seventh ; sāpiṇdya extends to seven generations and refers the readers to his Suddhitattva for elucidation. Raghunandana does not give any definition of sapindas for marriage, but discusses the confliot about the several texts such as &lsquo;7th on the father&rsquo;s side and 5th on the mother&rsquo;s side&rsquo;. He expressly says (p. 110 of Udvābatattva) that the words &lsquo;who is not a sapinda of one&rsquo;s mother&rsquo; are still applicable even if several females intervene between the common ancestor and the girl proposed to be married. He then adds &amp; special rule that descendants of what are called pitṛbandhus and mātsbandhus also are for bidden if they are within 7 degrees and 5 degrees respectively from these bandbus. The pitbandhus 1115 of a person are his paternal grand-father&rsquo;s sister&rsquo;s sons, bis paternal grandmother&rsquo;s aister&rsquo;s sons and his father&rsquo;s maternal uncle&rsquo;s sons; while mātrbandhus are &amp; person&rsquo;s mother&rsquo;s father&rsquo;s sister&rsquo;s sons, inother&rsquo;s mother&rsquo;s sister&rsquo;s sons, mother&rsquo;s maternal uncle&rsquo;s song. These two latter may be illustrated by two diagrams.</p>

In the ascending line only the descendants of the common ancestors are excluded. For example, SI is a pitrbandbu and his descen. dants up to 7 degrees are excluded; but Si&rsquo;s father is not a bandhu of the bridegroom; therefore Sl&rsquo;s father&rsquo;s sister may be married by the bridegroom. Under this rule the 6th descendant (&amp; girl) of Sl will be ineligible for marriage with A: but she will be 9th from A&rsquo;s grandfather&rsquo;s father who is the common ancestor. So it will be seen that this goes far beyond the limits of sāpiṇdys generally prescribed and there is no valid reason assigned for this.</p>

<p>N. B.&ndash;Here S1, S2 and 83 are mātṛbandhus of the bride groom. The maternal great-grandfather is the starting point in calculating prohibited degrees in the mother&rsquo;s paternal line. In the mother&rsquo;s maternal line the starting points are S2 and 83. In the ascending lines of the mātsbandhus the descendants of only the common anoestur are excluded. For example, the girl descended from S3&rsquo;s maternal ancestors may be married by the bridegroom and so also a girl descended from the paternal ancestor of S2 or $1.</p>
<p>Another rule propounded by Raghunandana is that even within prohibited degrees a valid marriage may be contracted if three gotras intervene. In the case of girls descended from pitbandhus and mātṛbandhus the computation of gotra must be made from them. For want of space it is not thought advisable to illustrate this by citing several examples. But one example is given to illustrate this rule.</p>
<p>A (common ancestor )</p>

<p>D (3) D(4)</p>
<p>Here according to the Bengal school S (4) can marry D (4) because three gotras intervene between her and the common ancestor, although S4 is only 5th in descent from the common ancestor; for according to the Bengal school it is not necessary that both the bridegroom and the bride be beyond the limits of sapiṇdaship, but only the bride need be so; while according to many writers of the Mitākṣarā school both must be beyond the limits of sapiṇdaship from the common ancestor.&ldquo;118</p>

<p>Sapinda relationship under Dāyabhāga</p>
<p>477</p>
<p>The Dayabhāga does not rely upon any Vedic passages for its theory of sapinda relationship. The Mit. (on Yāj. I. 52 ) relies upon three Vedic passages only in propounding the theory of sapinda relationship viz. &ldquo;indeed the mau bimself is born from himself (as son, Ait. Br. 33. 1)'; &lsquo;thou art born again (or reproduced ) in the offspring&rsquo; (Tai. Br. 1.5.5) and &lsquo;this body is made of six kośas ( sheaths ); three are derived from the father, three from the mother ; bones, musoles and marrow from the mother&rsquo;( Garbhopaniṣad). These passages at the most say that particles of the bodies of the parents continue in their offspring; but they do not say anything about the meaning of sepinda or the limits of the Eapiṇda relationship for marriage or in heritance. Even in the Rg. the words jñāti and bandbu&rsquo; which occur in the dharmasūtras (e. g. Ap. Dh. S. I. 3.10. 3, I. 5. 11 17. and Gaut. II. 44, IV. 3 and 5, VI. 3) frequently occur (vide Rg. VII. 55. 5 and X. 85. 28 for jñāti and Rg. I. 113, 2, V. 73. 4, VII. 72. 2, VII. 67. 9 for bandhu). All that we can say is that both meanings of sapiṇda were implicit in the word pinda from the earliest times and that the sūtra writers were conscious of both meanings.</p>
<p>As to the grounds on which marriages between near sapindas were prohibited various theories have been advanced by antbropologists. Vide Westermarck in his ‘History of Human marriage&rsquo;( ed. of 1921, vol. II. pp. 71-81 ) and Rivers on Marriage of cousins in India&rsquo; in J. R. A. S. for 1907 pp. 611-640. Some think that the prohibition was due to the abhorrence which men in the primitive times felt for incest. To me it appears more probable that in India at least the prohibition was due to two causes; firstly, the observed fact that, if near relatives marry, their defects are transmitted with aggravation to their offspring and secondly the fear that, if marriages between near relatives by blood were allowed, there may be clandestine love affairs and consequent loss of morals and it would be difficult to secure husbands for girls who would</p>

<p>The Par. M. I. part %, p. 59 expressly says that only such a girl who is not &amp; sapinda of the bridegroom within the prohi. bited degrees on any of the two theories of sāpindya (viz. by connection with particles of the body or with the balls of rice ) is eligible for marriage.</p>
<p>The question what support Vedic Literature lends to the two interpretations of the word sapiṇda may now be briefly discussed here.</p>
<p>The word pinda ocours &ldquo;117 in the Rgveda (1. 162. 19 ) and the Tai. 8. IV, 6, 9, 3 where it seems to mean&rsquo;s part of the body of the sacrificial animal thrown into fire as an offering&rsquo;. Here it is clear that the word pinda is not used in the sense of &lsquo;ball of rice&rsquo;. But in the Tai, S. II, 3.8.2 and in the Sat, Br. II. 4. 2. 24 the word pinda meang &lsquo;ball of rice&rsquo; offered to the Manes. The Nirukta III. 4 and 5 twice employs the words &lsquo;pindadānāya&rsquo; (for offering balls of rice). But the word sapiṇda bardly ever occurs in the Vedio literature and we have no means of judging in what sense it was used in the Vedic literature. In the dharmasūtras the word sapinda occurs frequently and the dharmasūtras show a close connection between offering pinda and the taking of inheritance ( vide Gaut. 14. 13, 28. 21, Ap. Db. S. II. 6. 14. 2, Vasistha IV. 16-18, Vispu Dh, S. 15. 40).</p>
<p>It was shown above (pp. 436-37 ) that some sages prohibit marriage with a sagotra girl while others prohibit it with a sapravara girl. A number of sages and works like Viṣnu Dh. S. 24. 9, Yāj. I. 53, Nārada (stripursa, verge 7) require that the girl to be married must not be a sagotra nor &amp; sapravara. Therefore it is necessary to understand the meaning of gotra and pravara. A detailed treatment of the topics of gotra and pravara would extend to a large treatise. Only &amp; few salient points oan be gone into here. The subject of gotra and pravara in the Vedic Literature has been treated at length by me in the J. B. B. R. A. 8. (New series vol. II. for 1935 ). Only the conclusions there drawn will be set out here.</p>

<p>Marriage-meaning of golra</p>
<p>479</p>
<p>The word gotra in the Rg. means &lsquo;cow-stable&rsquo; or &lsquo;berd of Cows&rsquo; in a few passages (I. 51.3, II. 17. 1, III. 39. 4, III. 43, 7, IX. 86.23, X. 48.2, X. 120.8). By a natural metaphor &lsquo;gotra&rsquo; was applied to a cloud (in which waters are pent up as cows in a Cow-stable) or to a cloud demon and also to a mountain range or peak which conceals water-yielding clouds. Vide Rg. II. 23. 3 (where. Bșhaspati&rsquo;s car is styled &lsquo;gotrabhid&rsquo;), Rg. X. 103.7(=Tai. S. IV. 6. 4.2, Atharva-yed&amp; V, 2. 8. and Vaj. S. 17. 39), Rg. VI. 17. %. X. 103. 6. In some of these verses it is possible to take &lsquo;gotra&rsquo; in the sense of &lsquo;fort&rsquo;. In some cases &lsquo;gotra&rsquo; probably means only &quot; assemblage&rsquo; (samūba) 0. g. Rg. II. 23. 18, VI. 65. 5. From this last senso of &lsquo;assemblage&rsquo; the transi tion to the meaning of a group of persons' is both easy and quick. There is no positive instance of the word &lsquo;gotra&rsquo; being unchallengeably used in the sense &lsquo;descendants of a common patriarchal ancestor&rsquo; in the Rgveda; but the concep tion underlying the idea of gotra was, it is plain, quite familiar even in the age of the Rgveda. In the Atharvaveda V. 21. 31118 the word &lsquo;visvagotryaḥ&rsquo;( belonging to all families) occurs. Here the word &lsquo;gotra&rsquo; clearly means a group of mon connected together' (by blood). The Kausika sātra IV. % quotes &amp; mantra in which gotra undoubtedly means &lsquo;a group of persons&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Several passages of the Tai. S. show that descendants of great sages were called after those sages. In Tai. S. I. 8. 18. 1 it is said &lsquo;the Hotr is &amp; Bbārgava&rsquo; ( descendant of Bhfgu ). The commentator explains that this is so only in the Rajasuya. It is quite possible that in those days descent was traced through teacher and pupil as well as through father and son. But there being a very few occupations only it is most probable that the son</p>
<p>generally learnt from his father the lore of the latter. In Tai. S. VII. 1. 9. 1 we read therefore one does not find (or know) two Jāmadagniyas (in succession) who are poor (or grey haired )'. From this it is clear that in the times of the Tai. S. Jamadagni was regarded as a very ancient sage, that several generations of Jamadagni&rsquo;s descendants had passed away by that time, that they were all known as Jāmadagnyas (or-gniyas) and that no two descendants were found to be poor (or grey. haired ) in succession.</p>

<p>In numerous mantras of the Rgveda the descendants of well-known sages are denoted by the plural form of the names of those sages. In Rg. X. 66. 14 we read the Vasiṣtbas have raised their voices like their father'. In Rg. VI. 35. 5 the Bharad. vājas are referred to as Angirases. According to Aśv. Srauta sūtra Bharadvāja is a gotra falling under the Angirogana. In the Brāhmaṇa Literature there are ample indications that priestly families had come to be formed into several groups named after their (real or supposed) founders and that such families differed in details of worship according to the group they belonged to. The Tai. Br. (1. 1. 4) prescribes that the consecration (adhāna ) of the sacred Vedio-fires is to be performed for Bbṭgus or Angirases with the mantra &lsquo;bhrgūṇām (or angi rasām) tvādevānām vratapate vratena-dadhāmi,&rsquo; that for other brāhmaṇas with the words &lsquo;ādityānām tvā devānām vratapate&rsquo; &amp;o. The Tai, Br, II. 2. 3 speaks of the &lsquo;Angirasi prajā&rsquo; (people of the Angiras group). The Tāpdys Brāhmaṇa &ldquo;119 prescribes that the camasa (oup) made of udumbara was to be given as dakṣiṇā to a Bagotra brahmana.' The Kausitaki Br. 1120 ( 25. 15 ) says that one who has performed the Visvajit sacrifice (in which everytbing that the sacrificer owned was gifted away ) should stay for a year with a brāhmaṇa of the same gotra. The Ait. Br. (30.7) contains the story of Aitasa and his son Abhyagni and it is stated that the Aitaśāyanas Abhyagnis are the most sinful of the Aurvas. In the Kauṣitaki Br. where the same story occurs it is said that the Aitaśāyanas became lowest among Bhrgus, as they were cursed by their father, According to Baudhāyanaśrauta-sutra the Aitaśāyanas are a sub-section of Burgugana. Sunaḥsepa, when he was accepted as a son by Viśvāmitra, came to be called Devarāta and the Ait. Br. (33.5) says that the Kāpileyas and Babhravas were affiliated to Devarāta. According to Baud. srauta-sūtra Devarata and Babhru are sub-sections of Visvāmitra gotra. Sunaḥsepa is said to have been an Angirasa by birth (Ait. Br. 33,5).1121 So this makes it clear that gotra relationebip was by birth in the times of the Ait. Br. (and not from teacher to pupil).

<p>Marriage-meaning of gotra</p>
<p>481</p>
<p>addressed their pupils by the gotra names e. g. by the Bhāra dvija, Gārgya, Aśvelayana, Bhārgava and Katyāyana gotras in Praśna I. 1, Vaiyāghrapadya and Gautama in Chandogya V. 14. 1 and V. 16. 1; Gautama and Bharadvāja, Visvāmitra and Jamadagni, Vasistha and Kaśyapa in Bṛ. Up. II. 2. 4. All this shows that the system of gotras with several sub-sections was well established in the times of the Brāhmaṇas and the ancient Upaniṣads. But the gotras are in these works referred to in connection with sacrifices or education. There is hardly any distinct reference in these to gotra or sagotra in relation to marriage. In the Lātyāyana-srauta-sūtra 1128 VIII. 2. 8 and 10 it is prescribed that one who has given away everything in the Visvajit sacrifice should stay three nights with niṣadas and may partake of their junglo diet and then again three nights with &lsquo;jana&rsquo; and then the sūtra gives several views about the meaning of &lsquo;jana&rsquo; one of which, that of Dhānañjapya, is that</p>
<p>jana' means a person with whom (i. e, with whose daughter) marriage is possible while one who is sagotra is called ' samāna jana'. This clearly proves that long before the Latyāyana. srautasūtra marriage with a sagotra had been forbidden. Besides several of the gļhya and dharma sūtras prohibit marriage with a sagotra girl. It is impossible to hold that this was a new conception that arose only about the time of these sūtras. Therefore, it must be supposed that prohibition as to sameness of gotra in marriage had its origin long before the period of the sūtras in the times of the Brāhmaṇa works (if not earlier).</p>
<p>Gotra was of supreme importance in several fundamental matters and it largely entered into several practices of the ancient Aryans. A few examples may be given here. (1) In marriage sagotra girls were forbidden, vide above pp. 436-37, In the Lājākomna at marriage two offerings were to be made by all except Jāmadagnyas, who had to make three (Aśv. gr. I. 7. 8–9).</p>
<p>(2) In matters of inheritance the wealth of one dying without issue went to his near sagotras ( Gaut, 28. 19).</p>
<p>(3) In grāddha the brāhmaṇas to be invited should not belong as far as possible to the same gotra as the person invi. ting ( Ap. Db. S. II. 7. 17. 4, Gaut. 15. 20).</p>

<p>(4) In pārvana athalipaka and other pūkayajñas, all were to out off oblations from the middle and fore-half of the havis, but for Jāmadagnyas ( who are pañcāvaltins ) they were to be cut off from the middle, the fore-part and the hind part (vide Āśv. gr. I. 10. 18-19 ). 118%</p>
<p>(5) In offering water to a preta ( a person recently dead) his gotra and name were to be repeated ( Aśv. gr. IV. 4. 10).</p>
<p>(6) In the caula ceremony tufts of hair were to be left in accordance with the gotra and practice of the family (Khadira gp. II. 3. 30).</p>
<p>(7) At the time of performing one&rsquo;s daily samdhya prayer, one has to repeat even in modern times one&rsquo;s gotra and prayara, the Vedasākhā and sūtra which one studies.</p>
<p>As regards srauta sacrificea a few interesting examples may be given. Jaimini establishes that sattras ( sacrificial sessions extending over 12 days and more ) could be performed only by brāhmaṇas and that among brāhmaṇas the Bhrgus, Sunakas and Vasiṣthas are not entitled to perform them (VI. 6. 24-26). Those of the Atri, Vadbryaśva, Vasiṣtha, Vaisya ( Vainya?), Saunaka, Kapya, Kaśyapa and Samkfti gotras took Nārasamsa as the second prayāja, while others took Tanūnapāt as the second ( vide Sabara on Jaimini VI. 6. 1).</p>
<p>The conception of pravara is closely interwoven with that of gotra from very ancient times. The two bave to be studied together. &ldquo;Pravara' literally means &lsquo;choosing&rsquo; or ' invoking (prarthana ).124 As Agni was invoked to carry the offerings of a sacrificer to the gods by taking the names of the illustrious rois ( his remote ancestors ) who in former times had invoked Agni, the word pravara came to denote one or more illustrious rṣis, ancestors of a sacrificer. A synonym of prayara is ārṣeya or ārga (as in Yaj. I. 52). Pravara entered into several domestic ceremonies and practices according to the grhya and dharma gūtras. For example:</p>
<p>(1) a bride was to be chosen whose father&rsquo;s pravara was not the same as that of the bridegroom&rsquo;s father. Vide</p>

<p>(2) In upanayana the girdle (mekhala) was to have one, three or five knots according to the number of rṣis constituting the boy&rsquo;s pravara.(vide San. gs. II. 2 ).</p>
<p>(3) In Caula the tufts of hair to be left on the head depended on the number of sages constituting the pravard of the boy&rsquo;s family (Ap. gr. 16. 6).</p>
<p>The mass of material on gotra and pravara in the sūtras, the purāṇas and digests is so vast and so full of contradictions that it is almost an impossible task to reduce it to order and ooherence. The learned author of the Pravara-madjart (which is the leading work on the subject) wrote in despair &lsquo;Here, in the parts of sūtras that have been quoted there is a great diver gence in the order (of the names of pruvaras) of the texts of the several sūtrakāras, this being specially so in the text of Aśvalāyana (srauta )-sūtra. Thus, though divergence is clearly established, yet following the order of the texts of the majority of writers such as Baudbāyana, Āpastamba and Katyāyana we shall declare (the rules ) about marriage or no marriage&rsquo;, 1385</p>
<p>We have first to understand what gotra in the sūtras and digests means and how it is inter-related to pravara. Among the sūtras that treat of gotra and pravara the srauta sūtras of Aśvalāyana (Uttaraṣatka VI, kbandas 10-15), Apastamba (24th praśna) and Baudhāyana (B. I. ed. vol. III pravaradhyaya at end) are the most important. The Pravaramañjarl (p.5) has a verse to the effect that Baudbāyana&rsquo;s pravarādhyāya is the best on the subjeot.</p>
<p>The Srautasūtra of Satyāṣadha Hiranyakegi (21st praśna) has a section on this subject, which is the same as Āpastam. basrauta with a few omissions and variations. The Baudha. yanaśrauta-sūtra says 1128 &ldquo;Viśvāmitro, Jamadagni, Bharad vāja, Gautama, Atri, Vasiṣtha and Kaśyapa are the seven sages and Agastya is the eighth; the progeny of these eight sages is declared to be gotra'. These seven bages are probably derived from what is stated in the Bļ. Up. II. 2. 3-4 (=Sate Bṛ.</p>

The same work ( Baud. srauta ) states that there are thousands, tens of thousands and arbudas (millions of millions ) of gotras, but the pravards are only 49. Besides the sūtra works, some purānas like the Matsya (chap. 195–202), the Vāyu (chap. 88 and 99, Ānan. ed.), Skanda III.2 (Dharmāranya kapda ) contain elaborate enumerations of gotras and pravaras. The Mahābhārata sets out at length the subdivisions (such as Madhuc. chandas, Devarāta ) of Viśvāmitragotra in Anuśāsa naparva 4. 49-59. Digests like the Smṛtyartbasāra (pp. 14-17 ), the Sam. Pr. (pp. 591-680), the Sam. K. (pp. 637-692), the Nirnaya sindhu, the Dharmasindhu, the Bāļambhatti contain a vast material on this topic. Tbere are also special works like the Pravaramañjarl on this topic. The general conception about gotra is that it denotes all persons who trace descent in an unbroken male line from a common male ancestor. When &amp; person says ' I am Jamadagni-gotra&rsquo; he means that he traces bis descent from the ancient sage Jamadagni by unbroken male descent. As stated by Baud. cited above, from very ancient times these male founders were supposed to be eight. This enumeration of eight primary gotras seems to have been known to Pāṇini. Patanjali says &lsquo;there were eighty thousand sages who observed celibacy. The accepted opinion is that the spread of progeny was due to eight sages includ ing Agastya. The offspring ( apatya ) of these eight are gotras and others than these are called gotrāvayava&rsquo;, 1128 Pāçini</p>

<p>defines gotra for grammatical purposes as &lsquo;apatyam pautra prabhști gotram&rsquo; (IV.1. 162), which means the word golra denotes (in my work on grammar) the progeny (of a sage) beginning with the son&rsquo;s son&rsquo;. For example, the son of Garga would be called Gārgi, but the grandson would be called Gārgyaḥ and the plural Gargāḥ would denote all descendants of Garga (downwards from Garga&rsquo;s grand-son). But this definition is a technical one in grainiar and is meant to indicate how derived (taddhita ) words are to be formed by means of termina tions. Even Pāṇini makes use of this technical sense only in the apatyādhikāra, but elsewhere in his work he uses the word gotra in the popular sense as comprehending all descendants of &amp; common male ancestor. Vide the Kāsikā on Pāṇini II. 4. 63, IV. 2. 39 and IV, 3. 80. The Sam. Pr. (pp. 591-592) lucidly uxplains 1128 this. That a man belongs to a particular gotra is known by him only from tradition, from his father and other elders or from people about him, just as he knows that he is a brābmapa from the same source 1130. Medhātithi on Manu III. 5. 194 has a very lucid and interesting discussion on this topic. His argument is: just as, though all persons are men, some are called brāhmaṇas, 80 among brāhmaṇas certain persons are known by immemorial usage (or convention) as belonging to certain gotras like Vasistha and the sūtra-kāras lay down that a certain gotra has certain pravaras; so the word gotra is applied to Vasiṣtha and other Eages by rūdhi (by convention or long-standing usage). It cannot be supposed that a person called Parāsara was born at &amp; certain time and then his descendants came to be called Parāsaras. In that case the Veda would not be anādi (beginningless), as it is sup posed to be, since it mentions Parāāgra, Vasistha &amp;o. So gotra is anādi like the brābmaṇa caste and the Veda. The word is also secondarily used to denote 8 person, who is very illustrious on account of his learning, wealth, valour or generosity,</p>

<p>who thereby gives a name to his descendants and then becomes the founder of the family. This is laukika gotra. But this is not the meaning of gotras which brāhmaṇas have. The secondary meaning may apply to the word gotra when used in the case of ksatriyas'.1131 The Mit. on Yāj. I. 53 says &lsquo;gotra is that which is known from tradition handed down in the family.''** Eao gotra is associated with one, two, three or five sages (but never four or more than five ) that constitute the pravara of that gotra. &ldquo;138 The gotras are arranged in groups, e. g. there are according to the Āśvaldyana-srauta-sūtra four sub divisions of the Vasiṣtha gana, viz. Upamanyu, Parasara, Kundina and Vasiṣtha (other than the first three ). Each of these four again has numerous sub-sections, each being called gotra. So the arrangement is first into ganas, then into pakṣas, then into individual gotras. The first has survived in the Bhṛgu and Angirasa gane. According to Baud. the principal eight gotras were divided into pakṣas. The pravara of Upamanyu is Vasiṣtha, Bharadvasu, Indrapramada; the pravara of the Parisara gotra is Vasiṣtha, Śaktya, Pārāśarya; the pravard of the Kundina gotra is Vasiṣtha, Maitrāvaruṇa, Kauṇdinya and the pravara of Vasisthas other than these three is simply Vasistha. It is therefore that some define pravara as &lsquo;the group of sages that distinguishes the founder (lit. the starter) of one gotra from another&rsquo;. 1184</p>
<p>Though the word pravara does not occur in the Rgveda, the word &lsquo;ārṣeya&rsquo; ocours therein and the system of pravara goes back almost to the Rgveda. Rg.

<p>Ch. Ix1 Meaning of ārṣeya or pravara</p>
<p>the word pravara or ārṣeya. In Rg. VIII. 102. 4 1186 it is said * I invoke Agni just as Aurva, Bbṛgu and Apnavāna did.' It is remarkable that these are three of the five pravara sages of the Vatsa-Bhrgus according to Baud. (3). Rg. I. 45. 3 has&rsquo;o Jatavedas (Agoi), give beed to the summons of Praskanya, as in the caso of Priyamedha, Atri, Virūpa and Angiras.&lsquo;1136 In Rg. VII. 18.21 it is said they who from house to house gladdened thee, being desirous of thee, viz. Parāśara, Satayātu and Vasiṣtha, will not forget the friendship of a liberal patron (like thee)&rsquo;. 1137 It deserves to be noted that this mantra mentions Parāśara (wbo in later mythology is the grandson of Vasiṣtha and son of Sakti), Satayātu (who is Sakti according to Sāyaṇa ), and Vasiṣtha. Parāsara, Sakti and Vasiṣtha constitute the prapara of Parāsar&amp; gotra (aocording to A$v. and Baud). In the Atharvaveda (XI. 1.16, XI. 1.25,26, 32, 33, 35, XII. 4. 2 and 12, XVI. 8.12-13) drseya means' descendants of sages or those who are related to sages'. In the Tai. 8. both ārṣeya and pravara occur in the sense of the sātras. In the Tai. S. II. 5. 8.7 ( which refers to the recita tion of the Sāmidbeni verses) we road &ldquo;he says &lsquo;oboose (or invoke) ye the fire called havyavāhuna&rsquo;; he chooses him ( the fire ) of the gods; be chooses the ārṣeya; in so doing he does not depart from the relationship ( by blood) and doing 50 serves for conti nuity. He chooses the later ones beginning from the remoter ones&rdquo;. In this passage &lsquo;ārgeyam&rsquo; appears to be used in the sense of one or more illustrious ancestors of the sacrificer' and reference is made to one of the two modes of mentioning the sages constituting the pravara. &lsquo;Arṣeya&rsquo; may also be taken here 88 an adjective (qualifying Agni), the meaning being &lsquo;ho invokes Agni by the names of the illustrious ancestor sages of the yajamāna&rsquo;. In one mode the remotest ancestor is named first in a taddhita ( derivative ) formation, then his descendant and 80 on, the sage nearest the sacrificer being mentioned last. For example, the pravars of Bhrgu Vatsa is &lsquo;Bhargava-cyavana apnavinaurya-jāinadagnyeti&rsquo;. This method is employed by the Hotṛ priest when lie invokes fire as the divine Hotr with the pravara-mantra &lsquo;Agne mahān-asi brāhmaṇa bharata deveddha</p>

In the other mode the affix &lsquo;vat&rsquo; is used after the name of each pravara sage and the remotest one is mentioned last (e. 8. Jamadagnivat, Urvavat, Apnavanavat, Cyavanavat, Bhrguvat). This mode is employed by the adhonryu when he chooses the Hotṛ priest. 1188 The Tai. S. IL 5. 11. 9 appears to refer to one ( i. e. 2nd ) mode. The Kauṣitaki brāhmaṇa explains the purpose of taking the names of ancestors * as the gods do not partake of the offering of him who has no list of ( illustrious ) ancestors, therefore be pro nounces the arṣeya of the saorificer.' The Ait. Br. ( 34.7 ) has an interesting passage on pravara. When a brāhmaṇa is initiated for a sacrifice, that fact is announced in these words</p>
<p>a brāhmaṇa has been initiated for a sacrifice. How is the initiation of the kṣatriya to be announoed? The reply of the Ait. Br. is * even in the case of the ksatriya the announcement is to be in the same form (viz. a brāhmana has been initiated); but with the prayara of the family priest. Therefore they ehould proclaim the kṣatriya&rsquo;s initiation as a sacrificer with the ārṣeya of his family priest and should invoke Agni with the pravars of his family priest. 1138 The Aśv. Sr. (Uttara patka VI. 15. 4-5) and Baud. Sr. ( pravarapraśna 54 ) say that in the case of kṣatriyas and vaisyas the pravara of their purohita was to be employed or the pravara · Mānava-Aila Paurūravaga' or simply · Manuyat.' The origin of that rule is to be found in the above passage of the Ait. Br. There is another similar passage in the Ait. Br. (35.5). The Sat. Br.</p>

<p>The Mahabharata says that the origioal gotras were only four viz Angiras, Kaśyapa, Vasistha, Bhrgu. 1141 The verses are rather abruptly introduced in the epic and there is nothing to show on what this statement was based and it appears that it is due to the imagination of the writer. Baud. as shown above states that the original gotras are eight. But it is remarkable that Bhrgu and Angiras (whose divisions and sub-divisions are many) are not included by him in these eight. Therefore, it appears that even Baudhāyana is not correctly stating the number of original gotras. Gautama and Bharadvāja are stated to be two out of the original eight, but both of them instead of being separately dealt with are grouped under the comprehensive Angirasagana.So even Baud. is not to be implicitly followed. The Bālambhatti mentions eighteen principal gotras (eight as in Baud. plus ten more some of which are names of mythicai kings &ldquo;148). Baud, himself says that there are millions of gotras and in the Baud. Pravarādhyāya there are over 500 names of gotra and pravara sages; while the Pravaramañjari quotes a verse that &lsquo;there are three crores of them &ldquo;143 and so the gotra system is difficult to comprehend&rsquo;, and it mentions about 5000 gotras. Therefore, as the Smṛtyarthasāra says the nibandhas endeavour to place the innumerable gotras under groups and distribute them among 49 pravaras (mentioned by Baud.) &ldquo;**. Some idea of these</p>

<p>gotras and their distribution among the prevaras is given below. The appendix under note No. 1144 collects together the 49 pravara groups,</p>
<p>The Bhṛgugana and the Angirogana are very extensive. The Burgus are of two sorts, Jāmadagnya and non-Jāmadagnya. The Jāmadagnya Bhrgus are again towfold, Vatsas and Bidas (or Vidas); the non-Jāmadagnya Bhṛgus are fivefold viz. Ārṣṭiṣeṇas, Yāskas, Mitrayus, Vainyas and Sunakas (these latter five are called kevala Bhrgus). Under each of these sub-divisions there are many gotras, on the names and number of which the sūtra kāras are not agreed. The pravara of Jāmadagnya Vatsas is con stituted by five gages according to Baud. and by three according to Kātyāyana. The prayura of the Bidas and the Arṣṭiṣeṇas also has five sages. &lsquo;45 These three (viz. Vatsas, Bidas and Arsṭiṣonas ) are styled pañcāvattin (Baud.5) and they oannot inter-marry (the reason will be explained below). The five non-Jāmadagnya Bhrgus have each of them numerous sub-divisions. These divisions of Bhṛgus are given here according to Baud. Ap. bas only six of them (and not seven as he excludes Bidas from this group). According to Kātyāyana, Bhrgus have twelve sub divisions ( vide Sam, Pr. p. 625 ).</p>
<p>The Angirogana has three divisions, Gautamas, Bhara dvājas and kevalāngirases ; out of whom Gautamas have seven sub-divisions, Bharadvājas have four (Raukṣāyaṇas, Gargas, Kapis and Kevala-Bharadvājas ), and Kevala-Angirases have six sub-divisions and each of these again is sub-divided into numerous gotras. This is according to Baud. Other sūtrakāras differ as to the subdivisions. Atri ( one of the eight primary gotras ) is subdivided into four (Atris proper, Vādbhūtakas, Gavisthiras, Mudgalas). Visvāmpitra is sub-divided into ten, which are further sub-divided into 7% gotras. Kaśyapas are sub divided into Kaśyapas, Nidhruvas, Rebhas, and Sandilas. Vasiṣtha has four sub-divisions (Vasiṣthas with one pravare only, Kundinas, Upamanyus and Parāśaras ) which are further sub divided into 105 gotras. Agastya has three sub-divisions (Agastyas, Somavābas and Yajñavābas), the first of which is further sub-divided into twenty gotras.</p>

<p>Marriages-sagotra and sapratara</p>
<p>491</p>
<p>When it is said that marriage with a sagotra or a sapravara girl is forbidden, each of these is separately an obstacle to marriage. Therefore, a girl, thougb not sapravara, may be yet sagotra and so ineligible for marriage or though not sagotra may yet be sapravara and not eligible. For example, the gotras of Yaska, Vādhūla, Mauna, Mauka are different, yet a marriage beta ween persons belonging to these gotras is not possible, because the pravara of all these is the same, viz. &lsquo;Bhārgava-Vaitahavya-Sāve tasa-iti&rsquo;.!!48 So also though the gotras Saṁksti, Putimāṣa, Tandi, Sambu and Samgava are different, there can be no marriage bet ween them as the prevara is the same, viz. &lsquo;Angirasa, Gaurivita, Samkftya&rsquo; (aco. to Asy, Srauta). When it is said that samāna pravaras cannot marry, sameness may be due to only one sage being the same in the pravaras of two gotras or there may be two or three or more sages that are common. The general rule is that if even one eage is the same!147 in the pravaras of two different gotras, then they are s&amp;pravara, except in the case of the Bbṛgu group and the group of Angirases. In these two latter unless there are at least three sages common ( when the pravara is constituted by five sages) or at least two sages are common ( when pravara consiats of only three sages ), there is no Bapravaratva and no bar to marriage. It will be noticed that among the five pravara sages of the Vatgas, Bidas and Ārsti ṣenas quoted above there are three sages that are common and so they cannot inter-marry.</p>
<p>Though the vast majority of gotras have three pravara sages, a few have only one pravara sage or two sages or five. Those who have only one sage are Mitrayus (pravāra Vādhrya Śya according to Aśv.), the Vasiṣthas (other than Kundina, Parāśara and Upamanyu) have only one pravara Vāsiṣtha, the Sunakas have one pravara Grtsamada (according to Aśv.) or Saunaka or Gārtsamada (according to Baud. 9); the Agastis have one pravara Agastya ( according to Ap. Sr. 24. 10.9); Āśv. optionally allows three pravaras to Mitrayus (Bbārgava Daivodāsa-Vādhryasya) and to Sunakas (viz. Bhārgava</p>

<p>Śaunahotra-Gārtsamada) and Ap. also allows to Agastis three pravaras ( Viz. Agastya-Dārdbacyuta-Aidmavāba-iti). Accord ing to Āp, and the purānas, Dhāpayantas have two pravaras (Vaiśvāmitra-Paurana-iti ), Aṣtakas Lohitas have two ( Vaisvā mitra-Aṣtaka iti), and Sandilas also have two ( Daivala-Asita iti). But he says that according to some the latter have three pravaras also (Kāsypa-Daivala-Asita-iti), while Baudhiyana gives four optional groups of three sages each for Sāndilas (Baud. 43 ). For Vāri-Dhāpayantas Aśv. prescribes three only (Vaiśvāmitra-Devarāta-Paurana ) and also for the Astakas. According to Baud. the Vatsas, Bidas and Ārstiṣeṇas ( among the Bhṛgus ) have five pravara sages; so also among Angirases, the Kaumaṇdas, Dirghatamasas, Raukṣāyaṇas and Gargas huvo five pravara sages, though the last have optionally three also.</p>
<p>The Ap. śr. 1118 ( 24. 5 6) says the sages to be invoked were to be three and they were to be seers of mantras&rsquo;. It is therefore that the number of pravara sages is limited; there was no such requirement for a gotra and so gotras multiplied to an unlimited extent.</p>
<p>There are certain families that are dvigotras (i. e. have two gotras). Aśv. uses the word &ldquo;dvipravācanaḥ for them ** They are principally three viz. Sauöga-saisiris, Sarkṛtis and Laugākṣis. From a Sunga, &amp; sub-division of Bberadvāja gotra, was born a son to the wife of a Saisiri, &amp; sub-division of Visvā mitra (hy niyoga); the son, therefore, came to be called Saunga Saisiri. Therefore Saunga-Saisiris cannot marry in both Bharadvāja and Viśvāmitra gotras. Their pravaras are given below riso. They have to select one pravara sage from one gotra and two from the other gotra or two from the first and three from the other. A pravara of four sages is not allowed nor of one beyond five. For the other dvigotras, the San. K. (pp. 682 686), Nirpayasindhu p. 300 ff. may be consulted. In the case of the adopted son also, on the analogy of the Saunga-saisiris,</p>

<p>both gotras and the pravaras of both gotras have to be considered and the diotum of Manu (IX. 142) that the son given does not share the gotra and inheritance of the genitive father and the svadha (sraddhas etc.) of the giver ceases&rsquo;, is restricted only to matters of inheritance, śrāddha and the like and does not apply to marriage. 1151</p>
<p>A few words must be said about the gotra and pravara of kings and other ksatriyas. It appears from the Ait.Br.quoted above (p. 488) that in the case of ksatriyas the pravara of their purohita was employed in religious acts where pravara had to be recited. This leads to the inference that most ksatriyas had forgotten their gotras and prayaras by that time. The Srauta sutras allow 1158 an option to kṣatriyas ( to kings according to Aśv.).</p>
<p>They may employ the pravard of their purohitas or all ksatriyas may employ the same pravara viz. Manava-Aila-Paurāravasa iti&rsquo;. Medhatithi on Manu III. 5 states that the distinctions of gotras and pravaras concern primarily brāhmaṇas alone and not ksatriyas and vaisyas and quotes Asv. Sr. (I. 3) in support, The Mit, and other nibandhakāras rely on the first alternative mentioned in the sūtras and say that in marriages of kṣatriyas and vaiśyas the gotras and pravaras of their purohitas should be considered, as they have no specific gotras of their own 1153. This is carrying the doctrine of atideśa (extension) too far or with a vengeance. The Sam. K. (pp.689-690) assigns reasons for this attitude of the Mit, but they are not satisfactory. Ancient literature and epigraphio records show that kings had gotras of their own. In the Mahābhārata it is said that when Yudhisthira</p>

<p>went to the court of Virata in the guise of a brāhmaṇa and was asked by the king to state his gotra he said that he was of the Vaiyāghrapadya gotra ( Virāta-parva 7. 8-12). That this was the gotra of the Pandavas also follows from the fact that in the Bhismatarpaṇa 1154 that is performed on the eighth day of the bright half of Māgha, Bhiṣma&rsquo;s gotra is given as Vaiyā. ghrapāda or-padya and pravara as Sāṁkrti, Jaimini (VI. 6. 12-15) establishes that the Kulāyayajña was to be perform ed jointly by a king and his purohita (and so they could uso different pravaras it appears). The Pallavas of Kanci had Bhāradvāja as their gotra (vide E. 1. vol. I p. 5). The Cāluk yas are often described as &lsquo;mānavya-gotra&rsquo; ( vide E. I. vol. VI. p. 339). In a copper-plate grant of Jayacan. dradeva (dated samvat 1233 i. e. 1176 A. D.) the donee was a kṣatriya described as Rāuta-śrl-Rājyadbaravarman of the Vatsa gotra and of five pravaras viz. Bhargava-Cyavana Apnayāna-Aurva-Jāmadagoya, 1155 In the Garra (Bundelkhand) plate of the Candella king Trailokyavarma of Kālañjara a village is granted to Rāuta Samanta of the Bhāradvāja gotra in recognition of his father&rsquo;s death in battle with the Turuskas (E. I. vol. 16, p. 274 ).</p>
<p>In many inscriptions and copper-plate grants hundreds of donees with their gotras and pravaras occur and it would be an interesting study to compare the latter with the material derived from the sūtras and nibandbas. For example, vide E. I. vol. 19, pp. 115-117 and 248-250 for about 205 donees and their gotras in the plates of Bhāskaravarman, E. I. vol. 14, p. 202ff (500 donees with gotras in the time of Candradeva Gāhadavāla, samal 1150), E. I. vol. 13 p. 237, E, I. vol. 8 pp. 316-317 ( śake 1346 ), E. I. vol. 9 p. 103 (32 donees with gotras, pravaras, sakhas &amp;o.), E. I. vol. 12 pp. 163-167 ( 120 donees with gotras, Śake 1508 ), Gupta Ins. No. 55 Chammak plate of Pravarasena &amp;c. Even the Buddhists kept the system of gotras ( vide E. I. vol. 10, Lūder&rsquo;s list, No. 158).</p>

<p>Bhalandana-Vatsapra-Manktila'. They could also employ the pravara of their purohitas. The Sam. Pr. (p. 659) says that Bhalandana is the gotra of vaisyas.</p>
<p>If a person does not know his own gotra and prevara be should take those of his ācārya ( teacher of Veda), according to Ap.157 Though he takes his teacber&rsquo;s gotra, it is only the teacher&rsquo;s daughter that is forbidden to him in marriage and not other girls of the same gotra as the ācārya&rsquo;s. Both Sam, K. and Sam. Pr. (p. 650 ) quote a verse that when one does not know one&rsquo;s gotra one should call oneself of Kāśyapa gotra. This is so when he does not know even his teacher&rsquo;s gotra. The Sın, O. ( śrāddha section p. 481) says that this is so even when one does not know the gotra of one&rsquo;s maternal grand-father (i.e. he should offer pinda with Kāśyapa gotra to his maternal grand-father ).</p>
<p>The word gotra also came to mean any family name (surname). In the inscriptions we find this usage very often. For example, in the Bannahalli plate of the Kadamba king Krṣnavarma II (E. I. vol. VI, p. 18) a śreṣthin (a merchant) is said to have been of the Tuthiyalla gotra and pravara. The Reddi king (a śūdra ) Allaya Vema of Rajalımundry was said to have been of the Polvola gotra (E. I. vol, XIII. p. 237, of</p>
<p>śake 1356 ).</p>
<p>A few interesting matters about pravaras are noted below. It is noteworthy that even as to the same gotra, there is great divergence among the sūtrakāras about the sages constituting the pravara e. g. as to Sāndilyagotro, Āýv, gives two groups of the sages &lsquo;Sāndila-Asita-Daivala-iti&rsquo; or &lsquo;Kāśyapa-Asits-Daivala iti&rsquo;, but Ap. states his own view that there are only two sages in the pravara viz. &lsquo;Daivala-Asita iti&rsquo; and that some say they are tbree, Kāśyapa-Daivala-Asita-iti; while Baud. states four groups, &lsquo;Kaśyapa-Avatsāra-Daivala-iti, Kāśyapa-Avatsāra Asita-iti; Saṇdila-Asita-Daiyala-iti; Kāøyapa-Avatsāra sāndila iti.&rdquo; No adequate reasons can be given why even at so early an age as the sūtras, not only the order of the names in the pravara, but the very names in the prevara and their number should have varied so much.

The Smrtyarthasāra says that this picturesque description of them bas reference to the prayājas and the like i, e. by day they follow the procedure of prayājas peouliar to Vasiṣthas and by night that peculiar to the Kasyapas.</p>
<p>Among the gotras there are names of mythical kṣatriyas and kings like Vitahavya and Vainya and among the names of pravara sages many legendary kings like Māndhātý, Ambarlṣa, Yuvanāśva, Divodāsa appear. Vitahavya figures even in the Rgveda as closely connected with the Bhrgus (Rg. VI. 15. 2-3). In the Mahābhārata it is narrated that Vitahavya, being a king, attacked Divodāsa, whose son Pratardana pursued Vita havya, whereupon Vitahavya took shelter with Burgu and that when Pratardana asked Bhṛgu whether there was any ksatriya in the hermitage, Bbṛgu replied that there were all brāhmaṇas and that by this Vitabavya became a brāhmaṇa ( Anuśāsana chap 30 ).</p>
<p>Similarly the pravars of the Haritas is either Angirasa Ambarisa-Yauvanāśva-iti or Māndbātr-Ambarisa-Yauvunāśva iti. These are mythical royal cages. Among 1150 the Bhrgus is &amp; sub-division called Vainya which is further subdivided into Pārthas and Bāṣkalas. The story of Pṛihu who milked the earth is well-known (Droṇa-parva 69 ); he is called &lsquo;adirāja&rsquo; in Anuśāsana 166. 55. The Vāyupurāṇa in several places narrates that some kṣatriyas became the pravaras of brāhmaṇas. Vide chap. 88. 72-79, ( about Viṣnuvṛddha, 1160 who was descended from Purukutsa, whose son was Trasadasyu ), chap. 88. 6-7, 92. 6, 99. 158-161, 99. 169-170 ( Anan, ed.) for other examples 101. How and why kṣatriya names were adopted as brahmanical pravaras is obscure and difficult to understand. If one may hazard &amp; guess, it is probably due to the fact that the purāṇas retain very ancient traditions of times when there were no water-tight varnas and that ancient kings were learned in the</p>

<p>The connection of gotra and pravara may be stated thus: Gotra is the latest ancestor or one of the latest ancestors of a person by whose name his family has been known for genera tions ; while prevara is constituted by the sage or eages who lived in the remotest past, who were most illustrious and who are generally the ancestors of the gotra sages or in soine cases the remotest ancestor alone.</p>
<p>It has been seen (pp.437-38) that marriage between parties that are sagotra or sapravara is no marriage and the woman does not become the man&rsquo;s wife. What were the consequences of such a void union? Baud. 1163 (pravaradhyāya 54) says that if a man has intercourse with a sagotra girl he should undergo the penance of oāndrāyana, after that he should not abandon the woman, but should only maintain her as if she were a mother or a sister ; if a child is born it does not incur sin and it should take the gotra of Kaśyapa. Aparārka quotes (p. 80) Sumantu and another smrti to the effect that if a person inadvertently marries a sagotra or samāpa-pravara woman he should give up intercourse with her, should maintain her and undergo cāndrāyaṇa.&ldquo;163 But if he knowingly marries &amp; sagotra or sapravara girl the penance was heavier (viz, that for incest) and if he has intercourse with her or begets a child from her he loses his caste and the child will be a cāndala&quot;164. The rule of Baud, that there would be no blemish and the child will be of Kaśyapa gotra is restrioted to inadvertently marrying such a girl.1165 The Sam. Pr. quotes a verse of. Kātyāyana to the effect that if a marriage is gone</p>

<p>through with a sagotra, the girl may be again given in marriage to another. But the Sarn. Pr. gets rid of that inconvenient text by saying that it does not apply to the present age. So the poor girl for no fault of hers had to pass her whole life in enforced celibacy, being neither an unmarried woman nor a widow.9166</p>
<p>Questions about the validity of sagotra or sapravara marriages have not yet come before the courts ; but it is likely that in the near future courts will have to deal with such cases. If a marriage takes place under the Special Marriage Act of 1872 ( as amended in 1923 ) no difficulty will arise ; but recently several marriages have been celebrated under the old sastric procedure between persons who are sagotra or saprayara. Upon the strict letter of the dharmaśāstra texts such marriages are absolutely yoid. But it seems that the legislature should intervene and declare sagotra and sapravare marriages valid. Whatever may have been the case thousands of years ago when there were no means of communication and when there were small communities, the prohibition of sagotra relationship bad some plausibility and real feeling of close kinship about it; but now the prohibition has become meaningless. A man from Kashmir may marry &amp; girl from Madras and the parents of both may have the same gotra. Granting for argument that the gotra gage was a common ancestor, one does not know how many generations have intervened between that remote ancestor and the intending spouses and particles of the ancestor&rsquo;s body, if they have survived at all in the intending spouses of the same gotra, must be in the present generation in the most attenuated state. The prohibitions based upon gotra and pravara are said by orthodox people to be prescribed upon unseen (adreta ) grounds and so they argue that they must be held to be absolute and not admitting of any evasion by any one calling himself a Vedic Hindu. One may be permitted to reply to these people that when almost every-body has given up the ancient cult of the śrauta and gļhya fires and when hundreds of other innovations in ancient practices have been accepted without demur, there is hardly any justification for sticking to this one remnant of ancient practices. As a matter of fact many brābmaṇas now do not remember their pravara themselves but have to be told by the priests what their prevara is. Certain probibitions against</p>

<p>Marriage-sagotra relationship</p>
<p>499</p>
<p>marriage between near sapiṇda relations may be respected on account of their universal acceptance. Even the Special Marriage Act of 1872 presoribes that there can be no marriage between parties when they trace descent to a common ancestor who is the great-grandfather or great-grandmother (or who is nearer even than these ) of any one of them.</p>
<p>Sagotra relationship is in one direction wider than sapinda relationship and narrower than it in another so far as marriage is concerned. A man cannot marry the daughter of any sagotra, however distant the sagotra may be. Similarly even an adopted man cannot marry the daughter of a sagotra of his genitive father for two reasons, firstly because, though on adoption be becomes severed from his natural family for inheritance and offering of pinda ( vide Manu IX, 142 ), his other rela tionships with the natural family remain intact; and secondly because Manu (III. 5 ) says that the girl must not be a sagotra of the bridegroom&rsquo;s father and so even if by adoption &amp; man goes into another gotra, it is the father&rsquo;s gotra that is to be considered). Sapiṇda relationship prohibiting marriage extende only to seven or five generations, but prohibitions on the ground of sagotra relationship extend to any number of generations, On the other hand sapiṇdas may be either of the saine gotras i. e, Bagotra) or of a different gotra (i.e. bhinnagotra). Thus up to a certain limit sapiṇdas include both sagotras and bhinnagotras. The latter are called bandhus by the Mit.; they are all cognate relations and have an important place in inheritance. We have seen (p. 436-37) that sagotra marriages were totally forbidden in the sūtras (in the srauta sūtras like Lātyāyana srauta and in grbya and dharma sūtras). A passage of the Sat. Br.( quoted above at p. 461) is relied upon by Professors Macdonell and Keith (Vedic Index vol. I. p. 236 ) for holding that marriages within the third and fourth degrees on both maternal and paternal sides were allowed in the days of the Satapatha and that therefore &amp; man could marry in those days his paternal uncle&rsquo;s daughter, This latter is &amp; startling proposition. The passage in the Sat. Br. is no doubt expressed in general words (&lsquo;one may be united in the third or fourth generation&rsquo;). But that passage is geno. rally applicable even if only a marriage with a maternal uncle&rsquo;s daughter or paternal aunt&rsquo;s daughter is meant. The passage does not expressly allow paternal cousins&rsquo; marriages. The dharma-sūtras prohibit sagotra marriages. Both the learned Profesgors, as most western scholars do, probably hold that</p>
<p>500</p>
<p>History of Dharmaśāstra</p>
<p>(Ch. IX</p>
<p>the Satapatba is not separated from the sūtras by more than a few centuries. If &amp; paternal uncle&rsquo;s daughter had been eligible for marriage in the times of the Satapatha, but became forbidden in the times of tbe sūtras we shall have to suppose that an usage died out from one end of the country to another and an opposite usage became prevalent throughout within a few centuries. The smṛtis are not afraid of stating ancient practices which they themselves do not accept (i. e. niyoga). The smrtis do not say that marriages with paternal uncle&rsquo;s daughters were ever allowed anywhere. So it appears that the Satapatha is not referring to marriage with paternal uncle&rsquo;s daughter, but to marriage with maternal uncle&rsquo;s or paternal aunt&rsquo;s daughter. It must however be pointed out that Aparārka (pp. 15. 63), the Sm. O. (I. p. 12), Par. M. I. part 1 p. 133 and other digests quote a passage from the Brahmapurāṇa 1187 that sagotra and sapiṇda marriages are forbidden in the Kali age. It may be argued with some force that this implies that sagotra marriages once took place. But there are various ways of explaining this. It is possible that in the purāna the word gotra is not used in the technioal sense, but only in the sense of family or surname. Among sūdras there is no gotra in the strict sense, but they also do not marry a girl who is believed to be of the same family, though the exact relationships or generations are not known. Besides it has been shown above that if a woman was &amp; putrikā or married in the Gandharva or Āgura form she retained the gotra of her father and the son of the putriki would have the gotra of his maternal grand-father and yet being of a different family bis marriage with the daugther of a sagotra of the maternal grand-father might have taken place in ancient times and was forbidden in the Kali age by the purāṇa. Similarly the implied reference to marriages of sapiṇdas as taking place in former ages has probably marriage with maternal uncle&rsquo;s daughter in view. When in the kalivariya texts it is said these dharmas are deolared to be prohibited by the sages in the Kali age' (vide Vyavahāra-mayūkha p. 242 ), it is not proper to argue that everyone of the practices forbidden in the kali age was valid in former ages. All that is meant seems to be that most of them were allowed in former ages and these along with others enumerated are not to be practised in the Kali age, just</p>

<p>Prohibitions about Marriage</p>

<p>as when in a crowd many have umbrellas and a few have not, &amp; speaker still says with reference to the whole crowd &lsquo;chatriṇo gacchanti&rsquo; (here go persons with umbrellas ).</p>
<p>There are certain other prohibitions about marriage. The Smrtimuktāphala 1168 quotes a verse of Hārlta that one should not give one&rsquo;s daughter in exchange to another&rsquo;s son and receive that other&rsquo;s daughter in marriage for one&rsquo;s son, one should not give two daughters to the same man (at the same time), nor should one give one&rsquo;s two daughters to two persons who are brothers. But these dicta will now certainly be held as merely recommendatory. Besides there is no objection in India in modern times to marrying the deceased wife&rsquo;s sister, though even in England the deceased wife&rsquo;s sister could not be married until 1907 ( when the Deceased Wife&rsquo;s Sister&rsquo;s Marriage Act, 1907, Edw. 7 chap. 47 legalised such marriages).</p>
<p>The next question is as to who have power to arrange for the marriage of a girl and to give her away. The Viṣnu Dh. S. (24. 38-39) specifies the order of persons who are entitled to exercise this right of guardianship in marriage &lsquo;the father, the paternal grand-father, a brother, a kingman, &amp; maternal grand father and the mother are the persons, by whom the girl may be given away in marriage. In the absence of the preceding one (the right) devolves upon the next in order, in case be is able&rsquo;. Yāj. (I. 63-64) gives a slightly different order viz. he omits the maternal grand-father and adds that the right can be exercised only when the guardian is not affected by lunacy and similar defects and that in the absence of these the girl should perform svayamvara (i. e. choose a husband herself).

To give away a girl in marriage was not only a right but was rather &amp; beavy responsibility, as ( Yāj. 1. 64) and others declare that if a girl is not got married by the guardian at the proper time the latter inours the sin of the murder of an embryo. The practice of syayamvara is well known from the Rāmāyaṇa and the Mahābhārata, but it was confined mostly to the princely families. Manu (IX. 90–91) required a girl to wait for three years after she became marriageable before ble could choose her husband herself. But Viṣnu Dh. S. 24. 40 says that a girl should wait only for three monthly periods after sbe attains puberty and that after that period sbe has full power to dispose of herself in marriage as she thinks best.</p>
<p>There are no rules in the smṛtis as to who is to arrange the marriage of a male, since in ancient times they did not contem plate the marriages of minor males.</p>
<p>The mother has been put low in the order of guardians probably because of the dependent status assigned to women and because of tbe fact that in the ceremony of kanyādāna she cannot personally engage but has to get it done through some male relative. The courts in modern India, however, have held that the mother is entitled to select a husband for her daughter even when the girl&rsquo;s paternal grand-father is living, though the actual gist may be made by a male. Vide Bai Ramkore v. Jamnadas, I. L. R. 37 Bom. 18, where Yāj. I. 63 is interpreted as only laying down who are to make a gift of the girl and as not intended to take away altogether the mother&rsquo;s right of selecting a bridegroom in favour of even distant relations. Vide also Indi v. Ghania (I. L, R. 1 Lahore 146 ), Jawani v. Mula Ram (I. L. R. 3 Lahore 29, where it was held that, after the father, the mother of a girl has the preferential right to select a bride groom for her and that she is under no obligation to consult the girl&rsquo;s paternal kindred such as a paternal unole ), Ranga. naiki V. Ramanuja I. L. R. 35 Mad. 728, ( where all the authorities are examined). The Dharmasindhu states the important proposition that when the girl performs svayamvara or when the mother is to give away the girl in marriage, the girl or mother should perform the Nāudisraddha and the princi pal samkalpa is to be pronounced by her and the rest of the</p>

<p>Guardians for Marriage</p>
<p>503</p>
<p>rite is to be performed through a brāhmaṇa.&lsquo;170 Narada states the general rule that if anything is done by one who is afflicted with lunacy or similar defects, what he does is as if not done, 80 &amp; marriage settled even by the father if he is a lunatio need not be performed. If an unauthorized person (like a maternal uncle) were to give away a girl in marriage though her father is alive and fit, what is the result? The digesta statel 1714 that if the marriage has been completed by the performance of saptapadi, it cannot be set aside merely on the ground of the want of authority in the giver, since marriage rites are the principal matter and the authority to give is &amp; very subsidiary matter, the absence of which cannot affect the principal matter. But before the marriage takes place a person who wants to give away a girl, though persons better qualified exist, can be prevented from doing so. Courts in modern India have followed these rules, relying on the dootrine of &lsquo;factum valet quod fieri non debuit&rsquo; ( what ought not to be done when done is valid) and holding that when once a marriage is duly solemn ized and is otherwise valid, it is not rendered invalid because it was brought about without the consent of the proper guardian for marriage or in contravention of an express order of the court. Vide Khushalchand v. Bai Mani (I. L. R. 11 Bombay 247) and Bai Diwali v. Moti (I. L. R. 22 Bom, 509).</p>
<p>A few words must be said about the sale of girls in marriage. We read in the Maitrayapiya s. I. 10. 11 she indeed commits falsehood ( or sin ) who being purchased by her husband roams about with other males. 1178 There is another passage of the Veda relied upon along with the above by the pūrvapakṣa (the plausible view-point) in Jaimini (VI. 1. 10-11) which denies that women have &amp; right to</p>

<p>take part in Vedio sacrifices, viz. &lsquo;one should give to the daughter&rsquo;s father &amp; hundred (cows ) plus a charioti&rsquo; Jaimini replies ( VI. 1. 15 ) that the giving of a hundred with a chariot is not for purchasing a bride, but it is only a duty and a hundred must be offered as a present ( whether the girl is beautiful or not).&ldquo;173 This shows that, even if some girls were purchased for marriage in the times of the Maitrāyaniya S., there was a popular revulsion of sentiment about this practice and the sale of girls was severely condemned by the time of the sūtrakāras. The Ap. Dh, S. ( II. 6. 13. 10-11) also makes interesting remarks on this point 1174 &quot; there is no gift and the incidents of purchase about one&rsquo;s children; in marriage the gift ordained by Veda to be made to the daughter&rsquo;s father in the words ' therefore one should give a hundred ( cows ) besides &amp; chariot to the girl&rsquo;s father and that (gift) should be made to belong to the (married ) couple&rsquo; is due to the desire ( of the father to give a status to the daughter and her sons ) and is meant as a fulfilment of duty (and not as a sale transaction). The word ' purchase' applied to such a transaction is merely figurative, since the relationship (as busband and wife ) arises (not from the 80 called purchase but) from dharma.&rdquo; Vas. Dh, S. ( I. 36-37) quotes the two passages of the Veda (from Mait. 8. and the other about the gift of one hundred cows ) in support of the Mānuṣa (i. e. Asura) form of marriage. The Nirukta VI. 9 1175 while explaining Rg. I. 109.2 ( O Indra and Agni, I have heard you to be greater donors than a partially fit son-in-law or a brother-in-law') remarks that &ldquo;the word</p>

<p>Sale of girls in Marriage</p>
<p>505</p>
<p>bridegroom who is deficient and not endowed with all good qualities.&rdquo; So Yaska implies that in the south girls were sold for substantial sums of money to persons who ( either becauso they were old or wanting in some qualities desirable in a good bridegroom ) were therefore really deficient as bridegrooms. In the Nirukta ( III. 4) while discussing the several views about the obscure verse of the Rgveda IIL 31, 1 ( sāsad-vahnir &amp;o.) one of the reasons assigned for the view that women do not inherit is that gift, sale and abandonment in the case of women exist, but not in the case of mon, to which some reply that these ( gift, sale &amp;o.) can be minde of males also as is seen in the story of Sunaḥsopa ( in the Ait. Br. 33, Tai. S. V. 2, 1, 3, Tai, Br. I. 7. 10.).</p>
<p>These passages lead to the inference that in ancient times girls were sometimes purchased for marriage, as was the case in many other countries. But gradually public feeling entirely changed and not only was the sale of daughters by the father or brother severely condemned, but even taking of presents by thein was looked down upon. Ap. Dh. 8. has already been quoted above (note 1174). The Baud. Dh. 8. (1. 11. 20-21) 1196 quotes two verses that woman who is purchased with wealth is not declared to be a legally wedded wife (a patni); she is not (to be associated with the husband) in rites for the gods or manes and Kaśyapa declares that she is a dāsi ( slave girl). Those, who, blinded by greed, give their daughters in marriage for a fee (śwka), are sinners, sellers of their own selves and perpetrators of great sin and they fall into hell &amp;c.&rsquo; In another place Baud. says he who gives his daughter (in marriage) by sale (as a chattel ) sells his merit (punya)&rsquo;. Manu (III. 51, 54-55 ) strikes 1177 a tender note about daughters when he says &lsquo;a fatber should not take even the smallest gratuity for his daughter; if he takes a gratuity through greed he becomes the seller of his obild; when relations do not take for themselves wealth given by the bridegroom as gratuity (but hand it over to the girl) there is no sale ( of the girl ); the wealth so taken is for</p>

Fathers, brothers, husbands and brothers-in-law desiring their own welfare should honour women and should give them ornaments&rsquo;. Manu (IX. 98) further recom monds that even a sūdra should not take a gratuity when giving his daughter (in marriage), since in taking a gratuity he clan destinely sells his daughter'. Yaj. III. 236, Manu XI. 61 include the sale of cbildren among upapātakas. The Mah.. bbārata (Anuśāsana 93. 133 and 94. 3) condemns the taking of a gratuity for giving a girl and Anusāsana ( 45. 18-19) speaks of gāthās of Yama contained in dharma-gāstras &lsquo;who ever sells his son for a price, or gives a daughter for the sake of bis own liveli-hood in return for a gratuity, would fall into a most horrible hell called Kālasūtra&rsquo;. Verse 23 of the same ohapter says &lsquo;even &amp; stranger cannot be sold, what of one&rsquo;s own children&rsquo;. Verse 20 (= Manu III. 53 ) condemns even the Arsa form of marriage as a sale because a pair of cattle is therein taken by the girl&rsquo;s father. In Kerala or Malabar it is believed that the great teacher Samkara laid down 64 ācāras, among which are prohibition of the sale of girls, prohibition of sali &amp;c. Vide I. A. vol. IV, pp. 255-256 and also Atri v. 389 and Ap. (in verse) IX. 25 (ed. by Jivānanda ). This practice, however, persisted till modern times. For example, in an inscription dated about 1425 1178 A. D. from Padaividu (North Arcot District) we find an agreement signed by the representatives of Karnata, Tamil, Telugu and Lāta (South Gujarat ) brāhmaṇas that they would give up taking gold for their daughters and get them married by the simple kanyādāna ( the Brahma form ) and that the father who accepted gold and the bridegroom who paid gold were to be punished by the king and were to be excommunica ted from the brāhmaṇa caste. The Peshwa!19 issued orders (about 1800 A.

<p>Sale of girls in Marriage</p>

<p>who took money, for the giver and the interinediary who brought about the marriage. Among certain castes and among the sūdras even now money or money&rsquo;s worth is often taken when a daughter is married, but generally the money is meant as &amp; provision for the girl and for defraying the expenses of the girl&rsquo;s father.</p>
<p>The question of the sale of girls in marriage has been from the remotest ages bound up with the question of the father&rsquo;s power over his children Rg. I. 116, 16.180 and I. 117. 17 refer to the story of Rjrāśva who was deprived of his eye-sight by his father because the former gave a hundred rams to a she-wolf. The verses refer to some natural phenomena under a metapho rical garb and cannot be used for drawing the inference that a father could in law deprive his son of eye-sight at his will. The story of Sunaḥśepa ( Ait. Br. 33 ) shows that in rare cases the father did sell his son. The passage of the Nirukta about the power to sell, to gift away or to abandon daughters has been already cited (p. 505), The Vas. Dh, S. 1181 ( XVII. 30-31) says &lsquo;Sunaḥsepa is an example of the son bought&rsquo; (one of the twelve kinds of sons). The same sūtra (XVII. 36-37) defines the apaviddha kind of son as one, who being cast off by his parents, is accepted (as a son) by another. Manu IX. 171 also defines the &lsquo;apaviddha&rsquo; in the same way. Vas. Dh. 8. (XV. 1-3) propounds the absolute power of the parents over their children in the words &lsquo;man pro duced from seed and uterine blood springs from the father and the mother; (therefore, the parents have power to give, to sell or to abandon him; but one should not give nor accept an only son&rsquo;. Here Vas. states the right of patria potestas several centuries before Justinian, who makes the vain boast (Institutes, Lib. I. Tit. IX. 2) that no other people have a power over their children such as we have over ours'. Manu (VIII. 416) and the Mahābbārata 118€ (Udyoga 33. 64) both state that the wife, the son and the slave are without wealth and that what. ever they acquire belongs to him whose they are. Manu (in V, 152 ) says that&rsquo;gift (by the father of the bride ) is the source of (the husband&rsquo;s) ownership (over her)'. But gradually the</p>

<p>rigour of the father&rsquo;s power was lessened by other competing considerations such as the ideas that the son was the father bimself born again, and that the son conferred great spiritual benefit on the souls of the father and his ancestors by the balls of rice offered in srāddha. So gradually the father&rsquo;s power over the son becamo restricted. Kautilya (III. 13) gives the inte resting information that mlecchas incur no blame by selling or pledging their children, but an ūrya cannot be reduced to the state of slavery. Yāj. II. 175 and Nārada (dattāpradānika 4) both forbid the gift of one&rsquo;s son or wife. Katyāyana 1183 says that though the father has powers of control over the wife and the son, he has not the power to sell or make a gift of his son. Yāj. (II. 118-119 ) modified the rule about the son&rsquo;s acquisitions also. Manu VIII. 389 prescribes a fine of 600 panas for aban doning one&rsquo;s mother, father, wife or son when they are not sinners. Vide Yāj. II. 237, Viṣpu Dh. S. V, 113-114, Kautilya III. 20 (p. 199) for a similar provision. Manu (VIII. 299–300) restricted &amp; man&rsquo;s power to award corporal punishment for misconduct to his wife, son or slave to striking with a rope or a</p>
<p>thin piece of bamboo.</p>
<p>One question discussed by dharmasūtra writers is whether one has ownership over one&rsquo;s wife and children. Io Jaimini 1184 (VI. 7. 1-2) it is decided that in the Visvajit sacrifice where one is to give away all that one has, one cannot give away one&rsquo;s parents and other relatives as one can make a gift only of what one is master of. The Mit. on Yaj. II. 175 says though one cannot make a gift of one&rsquo;s wife or child to another, one is still owner of them.' The Viramitrodaya 1185 (vyavahāra p. 567) is of the same opinion. On the other hand the Tantraratna (of Pārthasārathimisra ) says that the word gift with reference to the son and the like is used only in a secondary sense viz. that of passing to another the power of control over the son</p>

<p>Marriage-Infanticide</p>

<p>or the daughter. The Vyavahāramayukha is also of the same opinion.</p>
<p>Afew words may be said about infanticide. Westermarok in his Origin and Development of Moral Ideas' vol. I. ( 1906 ) pp. 393-413 furnishes an exhaustive account of this practice in ancient and modern times among barbarous and civilised communities from various countries, e. g. in Sparta ( for the purpose of securing strong and healthy fighters ), among the Rajputs ( from family pride and fear of the crushing burden of expenses at inarriage ).1186 He is wrong in saying that in the Vedic times infanticide or exposure of children was practised. Rs. II. 29, 1 1187 is of no use on this point; it says &lsquo;cast off from me sin as a woman who secretly gives birth to a child (casts it off).&rsquo; This is not a reference to infanticide of children born in wedlock, but refers to the exposure of a cbild by an unmarried woman which is clandestinely practised everywbere and as regards which even in England a very lenient attitude is shown as manifested by the passing of the Infanticide Act (12 and 13 Geo. V. Chap. 18). The most important passage on which some European scholars like Zimmer and Delbrūck rely upon for this proposition is Tai. S. VI. 5. 10.3 They go to the avablıṣtha &lsquo;188 (the final sacrificial bath); they keep aside the sthalis (pots) and take up the vessels for vāyu : therefore they (the people ) keep aside the girl when she is born and lift up (i. e. greet with pride and joy ) the son&rsquo;. This simply refers to the fact that a daughter was not greeted as much as the son. It has nothing to do with exposure or infanticide. That passage only expresses the sentiment contained in the Ait. Br. 5189 (33.1)</p>

<p>the wife is indeed a friend, the daughter is distress (or humilla. tion ), the son is light in the highest heaven. The Mahabbārata ( Adi. 159. 11 ) in a similar veia says &lsquo;the son is one&rsquo;s self, the wife is one&rsquo;s friend, but the daughter is indeed a difficulty. But all the same the Grbyasūtras like Āp. ( 15. 13 ) call upon the father to greet his daughter also with a mantra when he returned from a journey, the differance being that in the case of the son there is kissing of the son&rsquo;s head and muttering of certain mantras in his right ear. Manu (IX. 232) advises the king to award death sentence to him who kills &amp; woman, a child or a brābmana. Manu IX. 130 ( = Anuśāsa na 45. 11) expressly says that just as the con is one&rsquo;s own self, 80 is the daughter like the son; bow can another person take the wealth (of the deceased) when his daughter who is his own self is there to take it'9 Nārada!90 ( dayabhāga v. 50) reasons that both the son and the daughter continue the line of the father and therefore in the absence of the son the daughter suc coeds as heir. Bphaspati exclaims&rsquo; the daughter is born from the limbs of the parents as much as the son ; when she is alive how can another take her father&rsquo;s estate&rsquo;? Bāns, who as a great post had unparalleled Bympathy with the emotions and feelings of the average man, makes even the king Prabhakara vardhana say about his daughter what every Indian father has felt for thousands of years' this rule of law laid down by some one vix, that one&rsquo;s own children ( daughtera ) sprung from one&rsquo;s body, fondled on one&rsquo;s knees and whom one would never forsake, are taken away all of a sudden by persons (husbands ) who till then were quite unfamiliar. It is on account of this sorrow that although both (son and daughter ) are one&rsquo;s own children the good feel sorrow when a daughter is born and who offer water in the form of tears to their daughters at the very time of their birth'. A daughter was not greated at birth, not because the father had no love for her, but because</p>

<p>he felt that a daughter meant &amp; source of anxiety all her life to him. It was the great concern felt for a daughter&rsquo;s well-being in life and her character that made the parents anxious that no daughter be born to them. Society expected a very high moral rectitude from women and treated lapses of mon with leniency. This is finely expressed in the Rāmāyana (Uttara-kānda 9.10-11). Ancient literature did not everywhere treat women with scorn and contempt. It has already been shown how bigbly the wife was regarded even in the most ancient days as &amp; man&rsquo;s half. Rg. III. 53. 4 speaks of the wife as a haven of rest (jāyed-asiam), The Chan. Up.&rdquo; looks upon the sight of a woman in &amp; dream as very suspicious and as prognosticating success in religious rites already undertaken. Manu (III. 56 = Anusagana 46.5), though he has said, as will be shown later on, some very hard things about women, was not unmindful of the honour due to them and Aays in a chivalrous spirit where women are honoured there the gods love to reside; where they are not honoured, there all religious acts come to nought.' Maidens were regarded as pure ( vide p. 296 above ) and auspioious. When the king passed through his capital it was customary to greet him with fried grain showered by maidens (Raghuvamsa II.10). The Saunaka-kārika 119 (ms. in Bombay University Library folio 22 b) inoludes a maidon among the eight objects which were auspicious. The Dronaparva (82. 20-22 ) mentions numerous objects wbich Arjuna looked at and touched as auspicious when starting for battle, among wbich well-decked maidens are mentioned. Gobhila-smrti II. 163 saya that one that sees on rising from bed in the morning among others a woman whose husband is living is free from all diffi culties. The Vāmana-purana (14. 35-36) mentions several objects which are auspicious when one is about to leave home, among which figure brābmaṇa maidens. Vide Sm. C. I. p. 168.</p>

<p>words ocour &lsquo;the cows are killed on the Agbas and (the bride ) is carried away (from her father&rsquo;s house) on the Phalgunis&rsquo;, The cow was killed in Madhu parka which was offered to the bridegroom on the day of marriage. Or this may be a reference to the giving of cows by the bridegroom to the bride&rsquo;s father (as in the form later called arṣa). So it appears probable that this is a reference to marriage being performed on the day when the moon was in conjunction with the constellation of Agbaa (i. e. Magha). The two Phalgunis follow immediately after the Maghā naksatra. There is an echo of this in the Ap. gp. III. 1-2 which says &lsquo;cows are accepted on the Maghas and (the bride) is carried (to the bridegroom&rsquo;s house ) on the Phalgunis&rsquo;. This means that the marriage.(probably in the ārṣa form) is celebrated on the Maghās and the bride goes from her father&rsquo;s house on the next day after marriage or after one day more. The Asv. gr. ( I. 4. 1) says 1194 that &lsquo;in the northward passage of the sun, in the bright half of a month and on an auspicious lunar mansion, caula, upanayana, godāna and marriage are to be performed and tbat according to somo teachers marriage may be celebrated at all times&rsquo; (not necessarily in northward passage &amp;c). The Ap. gr. (2. 12-13) prescribes that all geasons except the two months of Sisira (i. e. Māgha and Phalguna)and the last of the two months of summer (viz. Aṣādha) are fit for marriage and all nakṣatras which are declared to be auspicious (or holy ). Ap. gr. further 1198 adds (3, 3)&lsquo;a father who desires that his daughter should be dear ( to her husband) should give her in marriage on the Nistyā (ie. Svāti con stellation); thus she becomes dear (to her husband ), she does not return (to her parent&rsquo;s house ); this is a procedure based upon the Brābmana passage.&rsquo; The Brāhmaṇa passage is Tai. Br. I. 5, 2. The Baud. gr. (I. 1. 18&ndash;19) is the same &ldquo;196 as Āp. gr. about months and adds that the nakṣatras for marriage are Robiṇi, Mrgasirsa, Uttarā Phalguni, Svāti; while Punarvasu,</p>

<p>Tiśya (Puṣya ), Hasta, Sravana and Revati are suitable for other ceremonies of an auspicious character. The Mānava gf. ( I. 7.5 ) says that the nakṣatras Robiṇi, Mrgaśiras, Sravans, Sravistha (Dhaniṣtha) and the Uttarās (i. e. Uttarāṣādbā, Uttarā Phalguni and Uttarā Bhādrapada ) are fit for marriage and for taking the bride from her parent&rsquo;s house and whatever other (nakṣatra ) is deolared to be auspicious. Kāthaka gr. 14. 9-10 and Vārāha gr. 10 are similar. The Rāmāyaṇa 1197 ( Balakanda 72, 13 and 71.24) speaks of marriage being per formed on Uttarā Phalguni, of which Bhaga is the deity. The Mahābhārata also speaks of marriage on a nakṣatra presided over by Bhaga ( Ādiparva 8, 16). The Kausika: sūtra ( 75,2-4) makes an approach to modern practice when it prescribes that marriage should be celebrated after the full moon of Kārtika and up to the full moon of Vaiśākha or one may do as one likes but should avoid the month or half month of Caitra. &ldquo;188</p>
<p>Medieval digests introduce many detailed rules derived from astrology which it is not possible to get out here. A few only will be indicated.

<p>writers about months one should follow the usage of one&rsquo;s country. One should not celebrate the marriage of the eldest son with the eldest daugter of a man in the month of Jyestha (or on Jyesthā nakṣatra ) nor should one celebrate a marriage in the month of birth or on the day of birth or nakṣatra of birth ( of the eldest son or daughter). Wednesday, Monday, Friday and Thursday are the best days of the week, but the Madana pārijāta says that any day is good if the marriage is celebrated at night. 1200 In marriage the moon must be in a strong position for girls. One should avoid Jupiter being the 4th, 8th or 12th from one&rsquo;s rāśi ( zodiacal sign in which the moon was at the time of birth). The Nirnayasindhu quotes &amp; verse that when the girl has reached puberty, then one should not wait till Jupiter is favourable, but marriage should be performed even when Jupiter is 8th from the zodiacal sign of birth, propitiatory rites however being performed for Jupiter. 1201 Upanayana and marriage cannot be performed when Jupiter is in the zodiacal sign called Leo ( Simba), but this applies only to the tract between the river Godāvari and the Ganges. 1203 From the nakṣatra and zodiacal sign at the time of birth ( in the case of both the girl and the bridegroom) certain astrological calculations were made in eight ways 1203 called kūtas. They were Varna, Vaśya, Nakṣatra, Yoni, Graha (planets governing the twelve rāśis ), Gana, Rasi, and Nādi, each later one of which was more powerful than each preceding one and marks (guna) from 1 to 8 were respectively assigned to each of these if the conditions laid down were satisfied. Two of these viz. gana and nādi are attached great importance even now among brāh manas and other classes also and so they may be illustrated here, though very briefly. The 27 nakṣatras are arranged in three groups of nine each, each group being assigned to Deva. gana, Manusyagana and Rākṣasagana as follows:</p>

<p>If the bride and bridegroom are born on nakṣatras that belong to the same class out of these three groups it is the best thing but if their nakṣatras of birth belong to different groups, then the rules are: it is middling if their nakṣatras belong to the deve group or the human group respeotively, or if the bride groom&rsquo;s nakṣstra being of the devagaña or rākṣasagana, the bride&rsquo;s is of the manuṣyagaṇa, while if the nakṣatre of the bride is of the rākṣaga group and the bridegroom&rsquo;s of the manusya type, then death would result.

<p>If the pakṣatras of the intended pair belong to the same nādi, then that portends death and so there is to be no marriage in such a case. The respective nakṣatras of birth in the case of the two should belong to different nādis.516</p>

<p>The apxieties of the girls' father did not end here. If after the marriage was settled but before it actually took place any relative in any of the two families died, then the marriage agreement was to be broken off according to some writers, but Saunaka 1204 mercifully states a more sensible and reasonable rule viz, if the father or mother or paternal grand-father or paternal grand-mother or paternal uncle, brother or unmarried sister of the intended bride or bridegroom dies, or the bride groom&rsquo;s first wife or his son from another wife dies, then only it is pratikūla and the marriage should not be performed, but the death of any one else presents no obstacle.</p>
<p>If before the rites of marriage begin (i. e. before the per formance of nandiśrāddha ), the mother of the bride or of the bride-groom has her monthly illness then the marriage has to be postponed till she becomes pu re (till the fifth day after the illness ),</p>
<p>Forms of marriage: From the times of the grhy&amp; sūtras, dharmasūtras and smrtis the forms of marriage are said to be eight, viz. Brahma, Prājāpatya, Arṣa, Daiva, Gāndharya, Āsura, Raksasa and Paisaoa ( vide Āśv. gr. I. 6, Gaut. IV, 6-13, Baud. Dh. 8. I. 11, Manu III. 21 = Adi-parya 73. 8-9), Visṇu Dh. S. 24.18-19, Yāj. .58, Nārada ( strīpumsa, verses 38-39), Kautilya III. 1, 59th prakarana, Adi-parva 102. 12-15 (they are described but not named); some of these arrange the first four differently, e. g. Aśv. g}. arranges them as Brāhma, Daiva, Prājāpatya and Ārsa, while Viṣṇu arranges them as Brāhma, Daiva, Ārga and Prājāpatya; Aśv. gr. I. 6 places Paisāca before Rākṣasa. The Mānava gr. speaks of only two Brāhma and Saulka (i, e. Asura), probably because these two were the forms most current. Āp. Dh. S. (II. 5. 11. 17-20&ndash;II. 5. 12. 1-2) speaks of only six, omitting Prājāpatya and Paiśāca ; while Vas. Dh. 8. I. 28-29 expressly says that there are only six forms of marriage viz. Brāhma, Daiva, Arṣa, Gāndharva, Kṣatra and Mānuṣa ( the last two being the same as Rākṣaga and Asura ). It is impossible for want of space to set out the various definitions of the several forms given by the several authors. There is general agreement on the special characteristics of each and it is sufficient to point out these as given in Manu III. 27-34.</p>

<p>The gift of a daughter, after decking her (with valuable garments ) and honouring her (with jewels &amp;c.), to &amp; man learned in the Vedas and of good conduct, whom the father of the girl himself invites, is called Brāhma. When the father gives away his daughter after decking her (with ornaments &amp;c.) to a priest, who duly officiates at &amp; sacrifice, during the course of its performance, it is the Daiva form. 1305 When there is &amp; gift of one&rsquo;s daughter, after taking one pair of cattle (&amp; cow and a bull ) or two pairs only as a matter of fulfilling the law (and not as a sale of the girl ), that is named the ārṣa form, The gift of &amp; daughter, after the father has addressed ( the couple with the words &lsquo;may both of you perform your religious duties together&rsquo;) and after he has honoured the bride-groom ( with Madhuparka &amp;c.), is declared to constitute the Prājāpatya form. Yāj. I. 60 calls this &lsquo;kaya&rsquo;, because in the Brāhmaṇa works &lsquo;ka&rsquo; means ' Prajā pati'. When the girl is given away at the father&rsquo;s will after the bride-groom gives as much wealth ag he can afford to pay to the relatives of the girl and to the girl herself, that is called the Asura form. The union of a girl and the bride-groom by their mutual consent is known as Gāndharva, which springs from the passion of love and has intercourse as its purpose. The forcible abduction of a maiden from her house, while she weeps and cries aloud, after her kinsmen have been slain (or beaten), wounded and their houses or fortresges) are broken open, is called the Rakṣasa form. When a man has intercourse with a girl stealthily while she is asleep or intoxi cated or disordered in mind (or unconscious), that is the Paisāca form, which is the basest and the most sinful of all forms.</p>
<p>In the first four forms there is the gift of the girl (kanyādāna) by the father or other guardian to the bride-groom. The word *dāna' bere is used in 8 secondary sense (as stated above on p. 504) viz, in the sense of transfer of the father&rsquo;s right of guardia pship and ountrol of the maiden to the husband. All gifts are to be made with water in the case of brāhmaṇas as stated by Manu</p>

Medbātithi on Manu III. 28 is against the idea of the bride being part of the sacrificial fee. Visvarūpa also says RO; but Apararka p. 89 holds that the girl is givon as fee.</li>

<p>( III. 35 ) and Gaut. V. 16-17. 1206 Similarly in all the four forms where there is kanyādana the girl is to be well dressed and deoked with ornaments. The essence of the brābma form is that the girl is given without receiving anything from the bride-groom, who is invited and honoured by the girl&rsquo;s father. It is called brāhma either because brabma means the holy Veda and this mode being sanctioned by the most ancient texts it is the holiest and best form, or brahma means dharma and being the best of all forms it is called brāhma (vide Smṛtimuk tāphala part I. p. 140). In the ārṣa form &amp; pair of cattle is received from the bride-groom and it is somewhat inferior to the brāhma form. But the pair is given not as a price (i. e. there is no purchase ), but because that is one way of effecting &amp; marriage laid down by the sāstras (vide the passage quoted above at p. 504 . therefore one should give a hundred cows &amp;c' and Āp. Db. S. II. 6.13. 11, which is opposed to Vas. Db. 8. I. 36 ) and the gift is made to show one&rsquo;s regard for the girl (vide Manu III, 53-54). The daiva form is only appropriate to brāhmanas as only 1307 a brāhmaṇa could officiate at &amp; sacrifice. It is so called because the bridegroom is engaged at the time in rites for the gods and it is inferior to the brābma inasmuch as in it there is soine trace of benefit to the father ( that the priest may do his best in the rite for the gods ). Govindasvāmin on Baud. Db. S. says the bride is in this form part of the sacrificial fee'. In all forms of marriage the husband and wife have to perform all religious acts together, as forcibly put by Ap. Dh, S. 1208 ( there is no separation betweon husband and wife, since from the time of taking the band of the wife there is joint perforin ance of all religious actions). But in the Prājāpatya the words used indicate according to the commentators ( vide Sam.</p>

<p>Forms of Marriage</p>

<p>Pr. p. 852 and Haradatta on Gaut. IV. 5) one or more of several things, viz. that the husband will remain a house-holder all his life and will not become a recluse while the wife is living or that he will not marry another wife i. e. it will be a strictly monogamous marriage which is defined in Hyde v. Hyde (1866), P. and M. p. 130 as &lsquo;the voluntary union for life of one man and one woman to the exclusion of all others&rsquo; (p. 133 ), or that he will associate the wife with himself not only in sacrifices but also in works of charity (like building tanks, wells &amp;c.). This form is inferior to brāhma in that the father, as it were, makes a special stipulation with the bride-groom, while in the brābina there is no such special stipulation, but the bride-groom promises that he will not break faith with his wife in the matter of the three puruṣārthas, dharma, artba, kāma. 1208</p>
<p>In the āsura form there is practically a sale of the girl for money or money&rsquo;s worth and so it is not approved. The arṣa is distinguished from āsura in this that in the latter there is no limit to what is taken from the bride-groom, while in the former a pair of cattle is offered as a matter of form. In the gāndharva there is no gift by the father; on the contrary the father&rsquo;s authority is set at naught by the girl for the time being. Marriage was a sacrament according to ancient sages, and its principal purposes as stated above (pp. 428–29) were the acquisition of merit by the performance of religious duty and of progeny. In the gandharva form the principal object was gratification of carnal desires and so it is held inferior to the first four forms and is disapproved. This kind of marriage is so called because it is prompted by mutual love and the Gandharves were known to be libidinous, as the Tai. S. VI. 1.6.5 (strikāmā vai Gandharvab) and Ait. Br. V. 1 state. In this form at least the girl&rsquo;s feelings are consulted. In the rākṣasa and the paiśāca, there is no gift by the father and both are or may be against the wish of the girl. The forcible carrying of the girl is the essence of the rākṣasa (even if there is no fight because the girl&rsquo;s father takes no retaliatory steps in fear of the abductor&rsquo;s strength). It is called rākṣasa because rākṣasas ( demons) are known from legends to have been addicted to cruel and forceful methods. The paigāca is so called because in it there is action like that of pisācas ( goblins ) that are supposed to act stealthily by night.</p>

<p>It is not to be supposed that when ancient sages held that rākṣaga and paiśāoa were forms of marriage, they legalized marriage by capture or stealth. What they meant was tbat these were the means of securing 1210 wives and that there are not really eight kinds of vivāhas, but rather there are eight ways in which wives may be secured. It is for this reason that Vatsa gays that if a fine girl cannot be secured by any means she may be approached even in private by stealth and married. The sages condemned in no measured terms the paisāca. From the fact that Apastamba and Vasiṣtha both ignore the Paigāca and Prājāpatya it may be inferred that these two bad ceased to be recognised by their time and that the other sages enumerated them only because they appeared in ancient works and for the sake of completeness of treatment. Vasiṣtha ( 17.73 ) expressly repudiates the idea that legal wifehood can arise by forcible seizure of a girl &lsquo;if a damsel &lsquo;211 has been abduoted by force and not wedded with sacred texts she may lawfully be given to another man ( in marriage ); she is just as good as a maiden&rsquo;. The smrtis out of regard for the future welfare of the girl preferred to blink at the wrong done, but insisted upon the abductor or stealthy seducer performing the rites of homa and saptapadi in order to confer on the girl wronged the status of a legally married wife. But if the wrong-doer was unwilling to do this they recommended that the girl may be given to another in marriage and pronounced very heavy punishments for the abductor or seducer of a girl (vide Manu VIII. 366 and Yāj. II. 287-288). Sir Gooroodas Banerjee 1213 rightly expresses surprise at Macnaughten&rsquo;s saying that fraud was legalised by the Hindu Law in the case of the paiśāca form. Manu VIII. 366 says that if a man bas inter course with a girl of his own caste with her consent, he will have to give a fee to the father if the latter so desires and</p>

<p>Forms of Marriage</p>

<p>Medhatithi 1918 adds that if the father does not desire money the lover will have to pay a fine to the king, that the girl may be given to him or if she has lost her love for bim, she may be given to another and if the lover himself wants to discard her he should be forced to accept her (as a wife), Nārada (strl pussa, verge 72 ) similarly says that if a man has sexual inter course with a maiden who is a consenting party, then there is no offence, but he must marry her after decking her (with ornaments) and treating her with honour.</p>
<p>The Sm. C. and other digests state that in the gāndharva, asura, rākṣaga and paisāoa homa and saptapadi are necessary and they quote Devala and the Grhyapariṭista in support. The Mahābbārata (Adi. 195, 7) 1814 expressly says that even after svayamvara religious rites had to be performed. Kalidasa in Raghuvamsa VII describes how after the svayamvara of Indu. mati the principal religious rites of madhuparka, homa, going round the fire, pānigrahaṇa took place. Since Aśvalāyana first speaks of eight forms and then prescribes the performance of home and saptapadi, be implies that these are necessary in all forms.</p>
<p>The smrtis contain several views about the suitability of these eight to various varnas. All are agreed that the first four, brābma, daiva, ārṣ&amp; and prājāpatya, are the approved forms ( pragasts or dharmya). Vide Gaut. IV. 12, Āp. Dh. S II.5.12. 3, Manu III. 24, Nārada (stripuṁsa, verse 44) &amp;o. Most say that each preceding one out of the first four is superior to each succeeding one and that thus brāhma is the best (vide Ap. Db. 8. II. 5. 12. 4, Baud. Dh. S. I. 11. 11). Almost all are agreed that paiśāca is the worst. Manu III. 23-26 refers to several views. One view is that the first four ( brāhma &amp;o.) are the proper forms for brābmanes ( Baud. Db. 9. I. 11. 10, Manu III. 24). Another view was that the first six (out of the eight i. 8. all except rākṣaga and paigāos ) are allowed to brāhmanas and the last four to kṣatriyas, and the gāndharva, Apura and paisāca to vaisyas and sūdras (Manu III, 23 ). A third view was that prājāpatya, gāndharva and āsura may be resorted to</p>

<p>by all varnas and paisāca and āsurs should not be resorted to by any one of any varṇa ( Manu IlI. 25 = Anuśāsana 44.9-10), but in another verse (III. 21 ) Manu allows asura to vaisyas and sūdras'214*, Manu mentions the view that the gāndharva and rākṣasa are proper ( dharmya ) for a kṣatriya or a mixture of these two viz. where the girl loves the bride-groom, but ber parents or guardians disapprove or cause obstacles and the lover takes away the girl after a fight with her relations (Manu IIL 26 and Baud. Dh. 8. 1. 11. 13). Baud. Dh.S. 1218 (I. 11, 14-16) recommends āsura and paiśāca to vaisyas and sūdras and assigns the interesting reason for the vaisyas and sūdras do not keep their wives under restraints, they having to do the work of ploughing and waiting upon (the other varṇas)'. Nārada ( strīpumsa, verse 40 ) says that gāndharva is common to all varnas. The Kāmasūtra (III. 5. 28 ) first speaks of the brāhma as the best ( following the view of the dharmaśāstra writers ) and then, true to its own particular subject, gives its own opinion that gāndharva is the best ( Kāmasutra III. 5. 29-30).</p>
<p>The gāndharva form was very much in vogue among royal families. In the Sakuntala, 1218 Kālidāsa gives expression to this practice. In the Mahābharata 1917 Krsna says to Arjuna who was in love with Subhadrā that carrying away by force one&rsquo;s lady-love is commended in the case of valiant ksatriyas. In the Sanjan plates of Amoghavarṣa ( dated sake 793 ) it is stated that Indrarāja married the daughter of the Calukya king at Kaira by the rākṣasa form of marriage ( E. I. vol. 18, p. 235 at p. 243 ). Another and a very famous historic example of the raksasa form is the forcible abduction after &amp; most dashing and valiant fight by Pșthvirāja Cohan of the daughter of</p>

<p>The svayaivara very often spoken of in the dharmaśāstras was practically the gāndharva as stated by the commentary Viramitrodaya. 1918 It had several varieties. The simplest forni of svayamvara occurs when, as described by Vas. Dh. S. 17. 67-68, Manu IX. 90, Baud. Dh. S. IV. 1. 13, a girl, who attains puberty and whose father does not find &amp; proper husband for three years, herself seeks her husband (or after three months from puberty according to Gaut. 18. 20, Viṣnu Db. 8. 25. 40-41 ). Yāj. I. 64 also recommends svayamvara to every girl when there is no parent or other guardian who can find out a worthy husband for her. When a girl chose her own husband as above she had to return all ornaments given to her by her parents or brother and the husband who married her had to pay no sulka ( dowry ) to the father as the latter lost his power over her by not giving her away in time ( vide Gaut. 18. 20 and Manu IX, 92). This simple svayamvara was applicable to girls of all castes. Sāyitri indulged in this kind of syayar vars, when she went about in a chariot to find out a suitable husband for herself. But the svayamvaras described in the two great epics are often most elaborate and spectacular affairs and were confined to royal families. The Adiparya says that kṣatriyas commend svayamvara and resort to it, but they prefer a girl who is carried off after subduing her relatives, Bhiṣma carried off the three daughters of the king of Kāśi and got two of them ( Ambikā and Ambālikā ) married to his ward Vicitrapirya. 1220 The svayamvara of Sitā or Draupadi did not depend upon the will of the bride, but the bride was to be given in marriage to whomsoever showed &amp; certain skill as a warrior. In the case of Damayanti it was &amp; real choice of her husband by her ( Vanaparva 54 ff.) though sbe chose Nala in s vast and splendid assembly of royal suitors. Kālidase also</p>

<p>History of Dharmasastra</p>

<p>gives us a fine description of the evayamvara of Indumati in the Raghuvamsa. Bilhana in his Vikramānka-devacarita (canto IX) gives a description of the historio svayamvara of Candralekha ( or Candaladevi ) daughter of the Silābāra prince of Karahāṭa ( modern Karad), when she chose Abavamalla or Vikramānka, the Cālukya king of Kalyāna ( latter balf of 11th century). Such a svayamvara, it appears, was thought to be unsuitable to brāhmaṇas according to the Adiparva. 11 In the Kadambari ( Pārvabhāga, penultimate para ) Pattralekha says that svayamvara is ordained in the Dharmaśāstras. 1337</p>
<p>The Ap. Dh. S. II. 5. 12. A makes &amp; general statement that the progeny of a couple partakes of the character of the form in which they were married 1228 (i. e. if the marriage is in the best or in an approved form the son is good; if the marriage is in a condemned form, the son bears a low character ). Mapu (III. 39-42 ) expands the same idea by stating that sons born of marriages in the brahma and other three forms are full of spiritual eminence and are endowed with beauty, virtues, wealth, fame and very long life, while sons of marriages of the other four forms are cruel, are liars, haters of the Veda and of dharma. Some sūtras and smrtis state how many generations are rendered holy by a son born in one of the first four forms. For example, Āśv. gr. ( 1. 6) says that a son born of parents married in the brāhma, daiva, prājāpatya or ārsa forms respec tively brings purification to twelve descendants and twelve ancestors on both sides (i. e. his father&rsquo;s and mother&rsquo;s ), to ten descendants and ten ancestors on both sides, to eight descen dants and ascendants on both sides and to seven descendants and ascendants. Manu (III. 37-38 ) and Yaj. ( I. 58-60) put the matter somewhat differently. According to them the son of &amp; brāhma marriage brings purification to ten paternal ancestors, to ten male descendants and to himself ( in all 21 ), of the daiva marriage to seven paternal ancestors and seven male descen dants, of the prājāpatya marriage to six male anoestors, to six male descendants and to himself (in all 13), of the arṣa marriage to three male ancestors and three male descendants.

<p>(IV. 24-27 ) has similar provisions. Commentators like Visvarūpa and Medhatithi explain that these verses are not to be taken literally. They merely praise the extreme desirability of the brahma form. Visvarūpa, however, alternatively proposes that one may accept the texts of the holy sages as literally true, following the dictum of Sabara that there is nothing too heavy (or impossible ) for a holy text. 1224 One may laugh at these texts about the virtues of the several forms of marriage, but they are really intended to emphasize the high importance to the future of the race and to society of noble ideals of marriage, of morals and of a decent and peaceful mode of life.</p>
<p>The forms of marriage have their roots deep down in the Vedic Literature. Rg. X. 85 gives expression to a marriage in the brāhma form ( there is kanyādāna and so forth). The asura form (by payment of money ) is referred to in Rg. I. 109.2 and Nirukta VI.9 (quoted above in note 1175). The gāndharva form or svayaṁvara is indicated by Rg. X. 27. 12 (quoted above p.439) and Rg. I. 119.5. The story of Syāyāśva narrated in the Bșhad devatā (1.50) in connection with Rg. V.61 makes an approach to the daiva form. It is related in the Bșhad-devatā that Ātreya Arcanānas who officiated as a priest at &amp; sacrifice for king Ratha viti asked for his son Syāvāśva the hand of the king&rsquo;s</p>
<p>daughter.</p>
<p>In modern times two forms are in vogue, the brāhma and āsura. In the brabma form it is a gift of the girl pure and simple; in the āsura form it is like the sale of the bride for pecuniary consideration paid to the father or other guardian for his benefit. If this element of pecuniary consideration paid to the guardian.exists, its effects oannot be undone by the form of &amp; gift being gone througb. 1235 The gāndharva form is said to be obsolete now, yet in some cases before the courts it has been held that it is still in vogue. 1226 There can be no gāndharva if the girl is &amp; minor. Further if a widow remarries, that marriage</p>

<p>will be ordinarily regarded as gāndharva, because there will be no gift of a kanya ( as she is a widow ) and because she herself will generally arrange such a marriage.</p>
<p>Before proceeding to set out in detail the ceremonies of marriage, it would be best to analyse the contents of Rgveda X. 85, which is &amp; marriage hymn redolent of the highest ideal of marriage and conjugal felicity and several verses of which are recited even now in the marriage rites. The hymn refers to a mythical marriage of Sūryā, daughter of Savitr, with Some and the important features of the marriage, though not arranged in a regular sequence in the hymn, are: the two Aśvins went to ask for Sūryā as a bride for Soma 1297 (verses 8-9); Savitr agreed to give her (v.9), the bride-groom was treated with honour, presents were made to him and cows were killed for (or presented to) him; Soina took hold of her hand with the verge (36)' I 1228 take thy Land for prosperity (or love ) so that you may grow to old age with me thy husband; the gods, Bhaga, Aryaman, Savits, the wise Pūṣan have given thee to me for performing the duties of a house-bolder'; the bride is a gift by her father in the presence of gods and the fire ( v. 40-41); the girl passes from the dominion and control of her father and becomes united with her husband (v. 24); the bride is blest as follows: &lsquo;may you stay here together, may you not be separated, may you compass all life (long life ), happy in your own house and playing with your sons and grandsons; O Indra / make her endowed with worthy sons and prosperity ; bestow on her ten sons and make her husband the eleventh (male); may you be queen over your father-in-law, mother-in-law, over the husband&rsquo;s brother and sister (vv. 42, 45-46). 1939 Among subordinate items it is noteworthy that Raibhyā was sent along with Sūryā as her friend ( anudeyi) to make her time not hang heavy on her hands</p>

<p>The religious ceremonies of Marriage</p>

<p>In connection with the rites of marriage it is necessary to observe that the greatest divergence prevailed from very ancient times. Āśv. gr. (1.7.1-2) says&rsquo; various indeed are the observances of ( different ) countries and villages; one should follow those in marriages; what, however, is common ( to all or most ) that we shall declare'. Similarly Āp. gp. (2. 15 ) declares' people should understand from women (and others ) what procedure is (to be observed according to custom)&lsquo;and the commentator Sudarsanācārya notes that certain rites like the worship of planets, ankurāropaña and the tying of pratigara (the marriage string or ribbon round the wrist ) are usual and are performed with Vedic mantras, while others like Nāgabali, Yakṣabali and the worship of Indrāṇi are performed without Vedio mantras. The Kathakagshya 25.7 allows usages of countries and families to be observed in marriage and the commentators mention several such usages. As the grhy&amp;-sūtra of Asyalāyana contains perhaps the shortest account of marriage rites and as that sutra is probably the most ancient among the grhya sūtras I shall set out below the entire ceremony of marriage from that sūtra Then a few important details from other gshya gūtras will be added and it will be pointed out how in modern times a marriage is celebrated, particularly among higher classes. It must be remembered that there is not only great divergence as to the number of separate ceremonies that constitute the samskāra of marriage, but the sequence of even the most important ceremonies is different in the several sutras and the mantras also are different (though some like Rg. X. 185. 36 are common to all ). It is remarkable that out of the 47 vorges of Rg. X. 85, the Ap. Mantrapātha employs as many as 29 (most of which are quoted in connection with marriage ). The main outlines of the marriage samskāra show &amp; remarkable continuity for several thousand years from the times of the Rgveda down to modern times.</p>

Standing with his face turned to the west, while the bride is sitting and has her face turned to the east, he should seize only her thumb with the mantra &lsquo;I take hold of thy hand for happiness&rsquo; (Rg. X. 85.36 quoted in note 1228), if he desires that only male children be born to him; he may seize her other fingers if he is desirous of female children; he may seize her hand on the hair side together with the thumb if he be desirous of both (male and female children ). Leading her thrice round the fire and the water jar so that their right sides are turned towards (the fire &amp;o. ) he murmurs 1231 &lsquo;I am ama (this ), thou art sā (obe ), thou art sā, I am ama; I am heaven, thou art the earth; I am the saman, thou art the ?k.

Then he pours clarified butter over what has been left of the haris (sacrificial material or offering) and over what has been cut off ( separated from the aggregate ). This is the rule about the portions to be out off ( in every case where there is avadann). 1838 With the following verses (recited by the bride-groom)</p>

Without going round the fire the bride sacrifices fried grain a fourth time silently with the neb of the sūrpa (winnowing basket) towards herself. Some1234 lead the bride round each time after fried grain has been poured out, so that the two last oblations do not follow imme diately after each other. Then he loosens her two looks of hair if they are made up ( that is if her hair has been bound round on two sides with two tufts of wool), ( the right one) with the mantra &ldquo;I release thee from the fetter of Varuna' (Rg. X. 85, 24) and the left one with the following mantra (Rg. X. 85. 25 ). Then he causes her to step forward in a north-eastern direction seven steps with the words &lsquo;may you take one step for sap, second step for juice (or vigour), third step for the thriving of wealth, fourth step for comfort, fifth step for offspring, sixth step for seasons, may you be my friend with your seventh step 1 May you be devoted to me; let us have many sops, may they reach old age,1233 Bringing the heads of the two ( bride and bride-groom) together, he ( the ācārya) sprinkles</p>

And the bride should dwell that night in the house of an old brahmaṇa woman whose busband and children are alive. 1236 When she (the bride ) has seen the Pole star, the star Arundhati and the seven sages (the constellation of Ursa Major), let her break her silence and say &lsquo;may my husband live and may I secure offspring &lsquo;.1937 If ( the newly married couple ) have to make &amp; journey ( to their home in another village), let him cause the bride to mount a chariot with the verbe &lsquo;may Pūṣan lead theo from here holding thy hand&rsquo; (Rg. X. 85. 26 ); he should make her ascend into a boat with the hemistitch &lsquo;carrying stones (or the river called Aśmanvati) flows; get ready&rsquo; (Rg. X. 53. 8) and let him make her descend from the boat with the following hemistitoh; if she weeps let him pronounce the verse they weep for the living&rsquo; (Rg. X. 40. 10). They constantly carry the nuptial fire in front. At pleasing places, trees and cross roads, let him mutter&rsquo;may no way-layers meet us&rsquo;( Rg. X. 85. 32). At every dwelling place (on the way) let him look at the onlookers with the mantra &lsquo;this newly married bride brings good luck&rsquo;(Rg. X. 85. 33). He should make her enter his house with the verse' here may happiness increase unto you through offspring &lsquo;(Rg. X. 85.27). Having kindled with fuel sticks the nuptial fire and having spread to the west of it &amp; bull&rsquo;s bide with the neck turned towards the east and the hair outside he makes oblations, while she (the bride ) is sitting (on that hide ) and takes hold of him, with the four verses (one oblation with each verse ) may Prajāpati oreste offspring to us&rsquo; ( Rs. X. 85. 43-46 ); and then he partakes of ourds with the verse &lsquo;may all the gods unite our hearts&rsquo; (Rg.

<p>In this description of the samskārs of marriage there are three parts. There are certain rites that are preliminary, there are then a few rites that are of the essence of the samskāra viz. pānigrahaṇa, homa, going round the fire and the saptapadi, and there are certain rites like the seeing of the Pole star &amp;o. that are subsequent to the central rites. The essential rites are mentioned by all sūtrakāras, but as to the preceding and sub sequent rites there is a great divergence in the details. Even as regards the essential rites the sequence in which they take place differs. For example, the Asv. gr. (I. 7. 7) describes going round the fire before saptapadi, while the Āp. gr. describes saptapadi (IV.16) before the act of going round the fire ( V.1). The Gobhila grhya (II. 2. 16), the Khādira gr. (1.3, 31), and Baud. gs. (I. 4. 10) describe panigrahaṇa after saptapadi while many other sūtrakāras describe it before saptapadi. Then again there are many acts reference to which is altogether omitted in the Aśv. gr., 0. g. there is no reference to madhuparka (whioh is mentioned in Āp. gr. III. 8, Baud. gr. I. %. 1, Mānava gr. I. 9) nor to kanyādūna (which is referred to in Pār. gr. I. 4 and described in detail in Mānava gr. 1. 8. 6–9). Aśv. probably omitted express mention of kanyādāda, because in defining the first four forms he uses the word &lsquo;dadyat&rsquo; while in the last four there is no kanyādāna and Agy. wanted to desoribe ceremonies that were common to all forms.</p>
<p>Taking as many gļhya sūtras as I could read, the following is a fairly exhaustive list of the different matters described in the sarskāra of marriage. A few notes are added against those that are deemed important. 1289</p>
<p>Vadhūvara-gunaparikṣa: (examining the suitability of a girl or a bride-groom). This has been dealt with already (vide pp. 429-436 above).</p>

<p>some person or persons (Rg. X. 85. 8-9) to the father of the girl for asking her in marriage. The same was the practice in the sūtras. Vide San. gļ. I. 6. 1-4 (where Rs. X. 85. 23 in the mantra recited when sending them), Baud. gr. I. 1. 14-15, Ap. gr. II. 16 and IV. 1-% and 7. Even in medieval times, parti cularly among kṣatriyas, the bride-groom was the first to seek for the hand of a girl. In the Harṣacarita, prince Grahavarmā of the Maukbari race sent messengers for the hand of princess Rājyasrl, sister of Harga 1840. In modern times among the brahmanas and many other castes, the girl&rsquo;s father has to seek a bride-groom, though among the sūdras and several other castes the old practice is retained.</p>
<p>Vāgdāna or Vār-niscaya: (settling the marriage). This is described by Sān. gr. I. 6. 5-6. Medieval works like the 8. R. M. pp. 529-533 describe this ceremony at great length.</p>
<p>Mandapa-karaṇa: Erecting a pandal where the ceremonios are to be performed.' Pār. gr. I. 4 says that marriage, caula, upanayana, keśānta and simanta are to be performed outside the house in a pandal. Vide Sam. Pr. pp. 817-818.</p>
<p>Nandi-śrāddha and Punyāhavācana: These are referred to by Baud. gr. I. 1. 24; most of the gļhyasūtras are silent about these. Vide for these pp. 216, 218 above.</p>
<p>Vadhūgļhāgamana: (bride-groom&rsquo;s going to the bride&rsquo;s house). Vide Sān. gr. I. 12. 1.</p>
<p>Madhuparla: (reception of the bride-groom at the bride&rsquo;s house). Āp. gṛ. III. 8, Baud. gr. I. 2. 1, Mānaya gļ. 1. 9 and Kathaka gr. 24. 1-3 prescribe this. Vide below chap. X for madhuparka. Sān. gr. I. 12. 10 appears to refer to two madhu parkas, one before marriage and one after marriage (when the bride-groom returned to his own house). The commentator Adityadarśana on Kathaka gr. 24. 1 refers to the opinion of some that madhuparka should be offered at the close of the marriage, but states his own view that in all countries it is offered before marriage.</p>
<p>Snāpana, Paridhāpana and Sarnahana: (making the bride bathe, put on new clothes and girding her with a string or rope of darbha. ) Vide Ap. gr. IV. 8 and Kathaka gf. 25. 4. Pār: gf.</p>

<p>I. 4 refers only to the putting on of two garments, Gobhila gṛ. ( II. 1. 17-18) refers to bathing and putting on a garment, Manava gr. (&lsquo;1. 11. 4-6 ) refers to paridhāpana and semnahane. Strangely enough Gobbile gṛ. II. 1. 10 speaks of the sprinkling of the girl&rsquo;s head with the best of surā (wine), which the commentator explains as water.</p>
<p>Samanījana: (anointing the bride and bride-groom ). Vide Sān. gr. I. 12.5, Gobhila gp. II. 2. 15, Pār. gr. I. 4, in all of which Rg. X. 85. 47 is cited as the mantra with which anointing or sprinkling is done.</p>
<p>Pratisarabandha: (tying an amulet string on the bride&rsquo;s hand). Vide San. gr. I. 12, 6-8; Kausika sūtra 76. 8.</p>
<p>Vadhūvara-niskramana: (the coming out into the pandal of the bride and bride-grooun from the inner part of the house ). Pār. gr. I. 4.</p>
<p>Parasparasamiksana: (looking at each other). Vide Pār. gr. I. 4, Ap. gr. IV. 4, Baud. gr. I. 1. 24-25. Pār. gr. I. 4 says that the bride-groom recites Rg. X. 85. 44, 40, 41 and 37 at this time. Ap. gr. IV, 4 and Baud. gs, say he recites Rs. X. 85. 44. The Aśv. gs. pariĝista I. 23 says that first of all a piece of cloth is held between the bride-groom and bride and that at the proper astrological moment it is removed and then the two see each other. Lagbu-Asvalayana-smrti (15. 20) also says the same. This practice is observed even now, When the interposed oloth is held between the bride and bride-groom verses called manga laṣtakas are repeated by brāhmaṇas, the last of which verses is *tad-eva lagnam sudinam tad-eye&rsquo; &amp;o.</p>
<p>Kanyadūna : (the gift of the bride ). Vide Pār, gr. I. 4, Mānava gr. I. 8. 6-9, Varāha gļ. 13. The Aøv. gr. pariṭiṣta sets out the procedure about the kanyādāna which is the same open now. The Saṁ, K. p.779 notes about half a dozen different methods of uttering the formula in kanyādāna. It is in this rite that the father of the girl says that the bride-groom should not prove false to the bride in dharma, artha and kama and he responds with the words &lsquo;I shall not do so&rsquo; (nātioarāmi), 1241 This is done even now.</p>

Aśv. gr. says that the bride makes three offerings of fried grain when mantras are repeated by the bridegroom and a fourth is made of the remaining lājas by the bride silently. Some others speak of only three offerings by the bride.</p>
<p>Agniparinayana: (the bride-groom going in front takes the bride round the fire and water jar). It is while doing this that he utters the words &lsquo;amohasmi&rsquo; &amp;c. (vide San. gr. I. 13. 4, Hir. gr. I. 20. 2 &amp;c ).</p>
<p>Afmārohana: (making the bride tread on a mill-stone ). These three are done thrice viz. lājahoma, then agnipari mayana and asmārobana, one after another.</p>
<p>Saptapadi : (taking seven steps together ). This is done to the north of the fire; there are seven small heaps of rice and the bride-groom makes the bride step on each of these seven with her right foot beginning from the west.</p>
<p>Murdhābhiṣeka : ( sprinkling holy water on the head of the bride and of the bride-groom according to some and on the head of the bride only according to others ). Aśv. gr. I. 7. 20, Pār. gr. I. 8, Gobbila gr. IL %. 15-16 &amp;c.</p>
<p>Sūryodiksaṇa: (making the bride look towards the sun ). Pār, gr. I. 8 speaks of this and employs the mantra &lsquo;tac-oakṣur&rsquo; (Rg. VII. 66. 16 = Vaj. S. 36. 24 ).</p>

<p>Dhruvārundhati-darsana: (pointing out the Pole star and Arundhati to the bride at night on the day of marriage ). Āøv. gr. I. 7. 22 speaks of the seven sages in addition, Mānava gr. I. 14. 9 speaks of the same three and adds Jivanti, Bhār, gr. I. 19 speaks of Dhruva, Arundhati and other nakṣatras, Āp. gr. VI. 12 ( only Dhruva and Arundbatı), Pār. I. 8 (only Dhruva ). According to San. gr. I. 17. 2, Hir. g§. I. 22. 10 both the bride and the bride-groom remain silent till night. According to Aśv. gr. only the bride does so. Gobbila gs.

<p>Trirātravrata: (keeping for three nights after marriage certain observances). Vide A$v. above p. 530 for the observances which are enumerated by almost all sūtrakāras. Ap. gr. VIII. 8-10, Baud. gr. I. 5. 16-17 contain the interesting injunction that the newly married pair should sleep on the ground on the same bed for three nights, but should interpose between them a staff of udumbara wood anointed with perfumes and wrapped round with a germent or a thread and that on the fourth night it should be removed with the verses Rg. X. 85. 21-22 and thrown into water.</p>
<p>Caturthikarma : (rite on the fourth night after marriage ). This has been described above (pp. 202-204).</p>
<p>In the medieval digests certain other ceremonies are mentioned and they are observed in modern times also. A few of them will be noted below. Here again the order is not the same in all works. The Dharmasindhu p. 265 refers to this divergence</p>
<p>Simāntapājana: (bonouring the bride-groom and his party on their arrival at the bride&rsquo;s village ). This is done before vāgniscaya in modern times. Vide Sam. K. p. 768; Dharma sindhu III. p. 261.536</p>

<p>Gauri-Hara-pūjā: (worship of Siva and his consort Gauri). Sam. K. p. 766, S. R. M. p. 534 and 544, Dharmasindhu p. 261 ( notes that there are several views as to when kanyādāna takes place) describe this. Images of Gauri and Hara are to be made of gold or silver or pictures of them on a wall &amp;o. or on a piece of cloth or stone are to be drawn and worshipped by the intanding bride after puṇyābavācans and before kanyādāna. Vide Laghu-Āśvalāyana 15. 35.</p>
<p>Indrāni-pījā: (worship of Indrāni, the consort of god Indra). Vide San. K. p. 756, 8. R. M. p. 545. This seems to have been comparatively an anoient practice as Kalidasa in Raghuvamsa VII. 3 seems to refer to it (' there was absence of disturbers of svayamvara on account of the presence of Sacl'). Probably Sack was worshipped before the svayarmara began.</p>
<p>Taila-haridrāropana: (Applying turmerio powder to the bride-groom&rsquo;s body from what is left after the bride&rsquo;s body has been so treated). Vide Sam. K. p. 757, Dharmasindhu III. p. 257.</p>
<p>Ardrākṣatāropana: (mutual showering of wet unbroken rice grains by the bride and bride-groom). In a vessel of some metal like silver &amp; little milk is poured and clarified butter is sprinkled over it and unbroken wet rice grains are poured therein. The bridegroom applies milk and ghoe to the joined hands of the bride twice and thrice places rice grains in the joined hands of the bride so that her anjali becomes filled up and twice sprinkles ghee over her joined hands. Some other person does the same to the joined hands of the bride-groom and the bride&rsquo;s father places a golden piece on the joined hands of both. Then the bride-groom places his joined hands on those of the bride whose father then repeats &amp; mantra and raises her up; she then pours the rice over the head of the bridegroom who follows her in the same way. This is done thrice by each and then lastly by the bride ( 1. e. seven times in all). Then the priest sprinkles on their heads water with an udumbara twig together with durvā grass after reciting verses &lsquo;Apo hi atbā &amp;c. (Rg. X. 9. 1-3)&rsquo;. Then the couple make a tilaka mark on each other&rsquo;s forehead, garland each other and tie a thread with a turmeric piece on each other&rsquo;s hand ( whioh is variously called &lsquo;kankaṇa-bandhana&rsquo; or &lsquo;kautuka-bandhana&rsquo;). Vide Sam. Pr. pp. 828-829, S. R. M. p. 556. Kalidasa in Raghuvamga VII describes ardrākṣatd-ropaña as the last of the rites of marriage and in VIII. 1 speaks of the kautuka,</p>

<p>Mangalasutra-bandhana: (tying &amp; string having golden and other beads on it round the neck of the bride ). This is now regarded as the most important ornament which no woman will part with as long as her husband is alive. But the sūtras are entirely silent about it. Among the earliest references is one from Saunaka smṛti 1848 (ms. in Bombay University Library, folio 39 b). The Laghu-Āśvalāyana sıști 15. 33 also prescribes it and the mantra to be employed when doing so. Gadadhara on Pār. gr. I. 8 says that mangala-sūtra should be worn and garlands be placed round their necks by the bride and bride-groom, though the sūtra of Paraskara is silent on the point. The Baud. gr, sesa sutra V, 5 in describing &lsquo;arkavivāls&rsquo; speaks of māngalya sūtra to be tied to the plant. It is not clear whether it means the same as the mangalasūtra now tied by married women round their necks. About the nose-ring or nose ornament to which all women whose husbands are living attach the greatest importance in modern times, the sūtras, smitis and even the early digests are entirely silent. Dr. Altekar in his recent work Position of Hindu women in Hindu Civilization' pp. 362-64 holds from the evidence of the sculptures tbroughout India-that the nose-ring was unknown throughout the whole of India during the entire Hindu period' (i. e. till about 1000 A. D.). Mr. P. K. Gode in Annals of B. O. R. I. vol. XIX (for 1939) pp. 313-34 adduces evidence to show that a nose ornament was known to literary works from at least about 1000 A. D.:</p>
<p>Uttariyaprānta-bandhana: (Tying turmeric pieces and betelnut on to the end of the upper garments of both and making &amp; knot of their two garments together). Vide Sam. K. p. 799, S. Pr. p. 829.</p>

A basket of bamboo (vamsa) is used probably to symbolize the continuity of the family (vamsa) of the bride-groom.

<p>Two interesting questions arise viz. when can a marriage be said to be final and irrevocable and what would bappen if &amp; marriage is brought about by force or fraud.</p>
<p>Manu says (VIII. 168 ) &lsquo;what is given by force, what is enjoyed by force, aleo what has been caused to be written by force and all other transactions done by force, Manu has declared void ;&rsquo; and in VIII. 165 he places fraudulent transactions on the same footing as those brought about by force. There is great difficulty in applying these dicta to marriages. We saw above that Vas. Dh. S. (17. 73 ) and Baud, Dh. S, declare that if a girl has been carried off by force and has not been wedded with the repetition of sacred texts she may be given to another man in marriage. Viśvarūpe (p. 74 ) and Aparārka (p. 79 ) add a gloss that this can be done only after she has undergone a prāyaścitta. From this it appears that if the marriage rites (like saptapadi) have been performed, the ancient law.givers would not bave declared the marriage null and void even if the girl had been carried away by force or married by fraud. In modern works on Hindu Law the proposition is stated 1244 that &lsquo;&amp; marriage, though performed with the necessary ceremonies, inay be set aside by the court, if it was brought about by force or fraud.&rsquo; This opinion is based on what was said in some decided cases 8. g. Aunjona Dasi v. Prahlada Chandra (6 Bengal L. R. 243 at p. 254), Venkatachurgulu v. Rangacharyulu I. L. R. 14 Mad. 316 at p. 320, Mulchand v. Bhudhia 1. L. R. 22 Bom. 812. But in none of these cases was a marriage duly solemnized by the performance of the rites of pāpigrabana, going round the fire and saptapadi, set aside. There are mere</p>

<p>Ch. Thṛ</p>
<p>When is Marriage irrevocable</p>
<p>539</p>
<p>ohiter dicta in these cases to the effect that a marriage may be set aside by the court for force or fraud.</p>
<p>The Vas. Db. 8. (17.72) goes so far as to observe &lsquo;when &amp; girl has been promised in marriage (and the promise has been confirmed) with water, if the intended bride-groom dies, but tbe Vedic mantras have not been recited, that girl still belongs to her father (and may be given to another)&rsquo;. Kātyāyana 1345 has a similar verse &lsquo;if after choosing a girl as his bride, a man dies (or is unheard of) the girl after the lapse of three monthly periods may marry another&rsquo;. And another verse of the same author says that if a person after giving &amp; gratuity for a girl and stridhana to her goes abroad, the girl may be kept unmarried for a year and then may be given to another. Manu (VIII. 227) says &lsquo;the Vedic mantras recited in the marriage rite are a suro indication of wife-hood; but their completion should be under stood by the wise as cccurring on taking the seventh step&rsquo;. Aparārka p. 94 (on Yāj. I. 65 ) quotes a similar verse from Nārada (stripum &amp; v. 3). The Udvālatattva p. 129 quotes Yama to the same effect. So it follows that the marriage be comes complete and irrevocable the moment the saptapadi rite is performed, but before tbat rite is gone through there is a locus pænitentice or a power to resile from what has been under taken. Before the saptapadi is performed, if the bride-groom dies, the bride is still a maiden and not &amp; widow and can be married again 248. The most essential ceremonies of marriage are the homa and saptapadi. The Dronaparva'247 says that promise of a daughter and giving a daughter with water are not certain means of knowing wife-hood but saptapadi is known to be the completion of marriage. If any of the other ceremonies are wanting that would not vitiate the marriage. In I. L. R. 12 Cal. 140, it has been hold that the viddhi-śrāddha is not an essential ceremony and its absence would not vitiate marriage.</p>

<p>Even the Kāmaśūtra 1248 quotes the unanimous opinion of the dcāryas that marriages celebrated before fire as a witness cannot be revoked. In the case of sūdras there are no Vedic mantras and so in their case the completion of marriage will be determined according to custom. The digests like Gṭ. R. say (p. 57) that in the case of sūdras the marriage will be complete when the sūdra girl holds the fringe of the garment of the bride-groom.</p>
<p>Manu (IX. 47) declares &lsquo;once is the partition of inheri. tance made, once is a maiden given in marriage&rsquo;. This rule really means that once the ceremony of marriage is completed by saptapadi, the marriage is irrevocable and the girl cannot thereafter be given to any one else. But if a girl is only promised in marriage and if a more worthy suitor subsequently presents himself, then the father may commit breach of promise and give her in marriage to another. Vide also Manu (IX. 71 and VIII. 98). Yāj. I. 65 states the rule and the exception *A girl is given only once; a person who after having pro mised to give, deprives that man of ber, is liable to the punishment of a thief; but if a more worthy suitor approaches, the father may deprive the foriner ( suitor) of her (hand) though promised&rsquo;. The Mahābhārata ( Anuśāsana 44. 35 ) says that up to pānigrabana any one may ask for the hand of a maiden (even though promised before to another). Nārada ( stripu msa VV. 30 and 32 ) contains similar provisions. 1949 Conversely, if a man agrees to marry a girl and subsequently discovers defects in her or if she is diseased or already deflowered or given by practising fraud he may refuse to marry her. Vide Manu IX, 72. If a guardian gives away a girl without declaring the defects of a girl (and they are subsequently discovered) the guardian should be fined in the highest ammercement (according to Yaj. I. 66 and the lowest, socording to Nārada, stripumba v. 33). Aparārka 125° (p. 95 ) and others add that the defects referred to must be latent and not apparent or patent to view, If a suitor repudiates a girl who is free from defeots be should be fined in the highest ammercement and if he falsely accuses her of defects be should be fined one hundred panas (Vāj I. 66</p>

<p>Some of the smrtis and digests are very much exercised over the question of the bride having menstruation while the marriage ceremonies are in progress and homa is about to be performed. Atri 1283 ( Jivānanda part 1, p. 11, chap. V) pre scribes that having made the girl bathe with the Havismati (with a verse in which the word havis occurs, probably Rg. X. 88.1 or VIII. 72. 1) and to put on other garments and having offered an āhuti of clarified butter with the verse &lsquo;Yuñjate manaḥ&rsquo; (Rg. V. 81. 1) the ceremonies should be proceeded with. The Smṛtyarthasāra (p. 17 ) first quotes two verses (the same as Atri&rsquo;s) and proposes an alternative method viz. that the bride and the bride-groom should stay separate from each other for three days and on the fourth day after ceremonially bathing themselves should perform the homa in the saine fire.</p>

<p>CHAPTER X MADHUPARKA AND OTHER USAGES</p>
<p>Madhuparka: ( offering of honey by way of honour to 8 distinguished guest). The word literally means&rsquo; a ceremony in which honey is shed or poured'(on the hand of a person). The word occurs in the Jaiminiya Upaniṣad-Brāhmaṇa 1283 18. 4. The Nirukta ( I. 16 ) also refers to the usage of offering madhu parka with the word madhuparka repeated thrice. It appears that the Ait. Br. III. 4 when it says that if the ruler of men comes as a guest or any one else deserving of honour comes, people kill a bull or a cow (that has contracted a habit of abortion)' refers to Madhuparka, 1854 though that word is not actually used. In all grhya sūtras it is described at length. Most of the details are the same, the principal difference being that often different mantras are prescribed, though soine ( like the verse &lsquo;mātā rudrāṇām&rsquo;) are the same. The madhuparka &ldquo;255 is offered to sfurks (priests officiating at sacrifices ) when they are chosen for a sacrifice, to a snātaka who has come to one&rsquo;s house, to the king ( who rules one&rsquo;s country, when he comes to one&rsquo;s house ), to one&rsquo;s acārya, father-in-law, paternal and maternal uncles. The Mānava gr. (I. 9. 1), Khādira gr. IV. 4. 21, Vāj. I. 110 say that six persons deserve arghya (madhuparka ) viz. ștvik, ācārya, the bride-groom, the king, the Bnātaka and a person who is dear to one. Some like Baud. 1856 gr. I. 2. 65 add &lsquo;atithi&rsquo; (guest ). Vide Gaut. V. 25, Ap. gr. 13. 19-20, Ap. Dh. S. II. 3. 8. 5-6, Baud, Dh, S. II. 8. 63-64,</p>

<p>Manu III. 119, Sabhāparva 36. 23-24, Gobbila gr. IV, 10.23-24. It is laid down that if the persons enumerated come to one&rsquo;s house within a year after madhuparka has been onde offered, then it need not be offered again ( in the same year), but when a marriage is being celebrated in one&rsquo;s house or a yajña is being performed, then madhuparka must be offered to those persons (even if one year has not elapsed since the madhu parka was previously offered). Vide Gaut. V. 26-27, Ap. Dh. $. II. 3. 8. 6, Yāj. I. 110, Khādira gr. IV, 4. 26, Gobbila gr. IV. 10. 26. Rtviks are to be honoured in each yājña, even though several yajñas are performed in the same year ( Yāj. I. 110). Manu (III. 120 ) says that a king and &amp; snataka are to be honoured with madhuparka only when they visit one&rsquo;s house in 8 yajña. Visvarūps ( on Yāj. I. 109 ) Bays that madhuparka is to be offered to the king only and not to any ksatriya. Medhatithi on Manu III. 119 says that when &amp; king, whether a kṣatriya or not, comes to one&rsquo;s place madhu parka was to be offered, but not to a sūdra king. According to gļhya-pariśiṣta the madhuparka is to be perforined according to the rites prescribed in the sakh of the receiver and not of the giver. 1957</p>
<p>The procedure of madhuparka is set out from the Aśv. gr.1858 (1.24.5-26 ) &quot; He pours honey into ourds or clarified butter if no honey can be had. A seat,1289 water for wasbing the feet, arghya water (i. e. water perfumed with flowers &amp;o.), water for ācamana, honey mixture, a cow; every one of these they announce three times ( to the person who has arrived). The person (to be honoured ) should sit down on the seat made of northward pointed darbha grass with the verse 1260 &lsquo;I am the highest one among my kindred, as the sun among lights&rsquo; (lightnings ). Here I tread on whomsoever bears enmity to me.' Or he should repeat this verse after he has trodden on it. He should make ( thu host) wash his feet; the right foot he should</p>

VIII. 101. 15 ) and says &lsquo;let her go&rsquo;. Let the inadhuparka not be without flesh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few small inatters may be noted. Several ghya-sūtras (such as the Mānava ) describe madhuparka as a part of the marriage rite, while others like Asv. describe it independently. Others like Hir. gi. (1. 12-13) describe it as part of Samā. vartana There is divergence about the substances mixed in offering madhuparka. Asv. gr, and Āp. gr. (13. 10) presoribe &amp; mixture of honey and curds or clarified butter and curds. Others like Pār, gr. I. 3 prescribe &amp; mixture of three (ourds, honey and butter ). Ap. gṛ. (13. 11-12 ) states the view of some that those three may be mixed or five (those three with fried yava gruin and barley ). Hir. gr. I. 12. 10-12 gives the option of mixing three or five (curds, honey, ghee, water and ground grain). The Kausika sūtra (92) speaks of nine kinds of mixtures viz, Brāhma (honey and ourds ), Aindra ( of pāyaga ), Saumya (curds and ghee), Pauspa (ghee and mantha), Sārasvata (milk and ghee), Mausala ( wine and ghee, this being used only in Sautrāmaṇi and Rājasūya sacrifices), Vāruña (water and ghee), Srāvana ( sesame oil and ghee ), Pāriprājaka (sesama oil and oil cake ). The Mānava gr. I. 9. 22 says that the Veda declares that the madhuparka must not be without flesh and so it recommends that if the cow is let loose, goat&rsquo;s meat or payasa (rice cooked in milk) may be offered; the Hir, gr. I. 13. 14 says that other meat should be offered; Baud. gr. gays (I. 2.51-54) that when the cow is let off, the flesh of a goat or ram may be offered or some forest flesh (of a deer &amp;c.) may be offered, as there can be no madhuparka without flesh or if one is unable to offer flesh one may cook ground grains. As the cow became Baored, it became unthinkable to kill her and so other flesh was</p>

<p>offered. When even flesh-eating came to be abhorred, then only pāyasa and such other things were recommended. The Adiparva ( 60. 13-14) refers to Janamejaya&rsquo;s reception of Vyāsn with madhuparka and Vyasa&rsquo;s letting the cow looge. This abhorrence of flesh-eating will be dealt with later on. In modern times there is generally no madhuparka except in marriage and then too it is a simple matter and the elaborate procedure presoribed in some of the gļhya sūtras is hardly ever followed.</p>
<p>Certain peculiar ceremonies relating to marriage may now be described very briefly. In order to avert early widowhood ( which was judged from her horoscope ) for the girl to be married, &amp; ceremony called kumbha-vivāha was performed. It is described in Sam. Pr. (p. 868 ), Nirnayasindhu p. 310, Sam. K. (p. 746), S. R. M. (p. 528 ) and other works. On the day previous to the marriage &amp; jar of water in which &amp; golden image of Viṣnu is dipped is decked with flowers &amp;c. and the girl is surrounded in a network of tbreads, Varuna and Viṣnu are worshipped and prayed to give long life to the intended bride-groom. Then the jar is taken out and broken in &amp; pool of water and then water is sprinkled over the girl with five twigs and to the accompaniment of Rg. VII. 49 and then brahmanas are fed.</p>
<p>The Sam. Pr. (pp. 868-869) speaks of Asvattha-vivāha which is like kumbha-vivāba and performed for good luok to the bride and averting widowhood. Here the Aśvattha tree is substituted for the jar and a golden image of Viṣou is worshipped. The image is then given to a brāhmaṇa,</p>
<p>Arkavivāha: When a man has the misfortune to lose by death two wives one after another, before marrying a third wife he goes through a ceremony of marriage with the arka plant. This is described in Sam. Pr. pp. 876-889, Sam. K. p. 819, Nirnayasindhu, p. 328. It is described in Baud. gs. seṣasūtra</p>
<p>V.5 also.</p>
<p>Another question which takes up much space in ancient works but which is now of hardly any importance is parivedana, When a male got married before his elder brother or where a person married a younger girl before her elder sister was married, this act was called parivedana and was severely oon. demned as a serious encroachment on the rights of seniority and as &amp; sin. Gaut. 15. 18 and Ap. Dh. 8. (II. 5. 12. 22) declare that a younger brother married before an elder brother, and an elder</p>
<p>Ch. x]</p>
<p>Parivedaria</p>
<p>547</p>
<p>brother married after a younger brother are sinners, and should not be invited at a sraddha. Ap. adds that one who marries a younger sister before her elder sister is married, one who marries an elder sister after the younger sister has been married, one whose younger brother has kindled the sacred fires or offered a soma sacrifice before him (and a younger brother who kindles the sacred fires or offers soma sacrifice before his elder brother) are also equally sinful. Vās. Dh. 8. I. 18, Visṇu Dh. 8. 37. 15-17 also have similar provisions and Vas. Db. 8. ( 20.7-10) pres cribes krochra penance of twenty days for the husband of the younger sister married before her elder sister and for the husband of the elder sister married after the younger one, requires each of them to offer his wife to the other for the sake of form (to remove the slur) and then to wed her again with his assent. 1285 Vide Baud. Db. S. II. 1. 40 also. The younger brother who marries before the elder brother is called pariretta or parivividāna ( Manu III, 171, Ap. Dh. 8. II. 5. 12. 22) or parivindaka (Yaj. I. 223 ), the elder brother before whom the younger brother marries is called parivitia or parivinna or pariritti ( Manu III. 171 ), the younger sister who marries before the elder sister is called agredidhiṣt (Gaut. 15. 15, Vas. I. 18) or parivedini, the elder sister before whom her younger sister marries is called didhiṣi. The busbands of these two last respectively bear the appellations agre-didhiṣūpati and didhi. ṣūpati. The father or other guardian who gives away the girl in any of these cases of parivedang is called paridāyī or paridata. The younger brother who kindles the sacred fire before the elder is styled &lsquo;paryādhātr&rsquo; and the elder brother who is so treated is called &lsquo;paryāhita&rsquo; (Gaut. 15. 18). Manu IIL 172 ( which is almost the same as Baud. Dh. S. II. 1. 30 and Viṣnu Dh, S. 54. 16 ) says that the parivettā, the parivitta, the girl whom the younger brother marries before the elder, the man who gives away the girl in marriage and the officiating priest-these fire all fall into hell1288 (and must perform the penance of Cāndrāyana according to Viṣnu ).

<p>Yāj. IIT. 265 quotes Hārita-dharmagūtra on this topic to the same effect. Medhātithi on Manu III. 171 refers to the view of some that if a son kindles the sacred fire before his father, the same rule applies as between brothers and then refutes that view. Aparārka p. 446 quotes Uśanas that &amp; person may kindle sacred fires even before his father or grandfather with the latter&rsquo;s consent. The Trikāṇdamaṇdana ( I. 76-77 ) says that there is no sin in taking agnihotra and performing a sacrifice before an elder brother and the incurring of sin is only restricted to marriage, while the Smrtyarthasāra (p. 13 ) holds the opposite view that one should not kindle the Vedio fires before one&rsquo;s father even with the latter&rsquo;s consent. The Viṣnu Dh. S. ( 37. 15-17 ) enumerates parivedana among upapātakas. Gaut. ( 18. 18-19 ) prescribes that if an elder brother has gone to a foreign country his younger brother must wait twelve years before he takes a wife or kindles sacred fires or six years according to some. 1287 There is a similar text of Vas. quoted by Apararka p. 445.</p>
<p>In certain cases marrying or kindling saored fires before an elder brother is not condemned. Medhātithi on Manu III. 171 quotes a verse &lsquo;One need not wait where the elder brother is a lunatic, or is a sinner, or leprous, impotent, or suffering from tuberoulosis&rsquo; and remarks that this is only illustrative (i. e. one need not wait where the elder brother has no adhikārs for marriage or for kindling fires) 1288 Vide Atri v. 105 ( Anan. ed.) for a similar verse. Another verge of Atri (v. 106 ) says that there is no blemish in marrying before the elder brother, if the latter is impotent or gone abroad, or palita or has become a reoluse or is devoted to Yogagastra 1269. Vide Gobhila smrti (1. 72-74) for similar verses ( which are quoted by the Gr. R. p. 90), Trikāndamapdana I. 68–74, Smṛtyarthasāra p. 13 and Sam. Pr. pp. 760-766.</p>
<p>The ideas about the wrong committed by a younger brother or sister marrying before an elder one reach far back into Vedio antiquity. In the Tai. Br. (III. 2. 9) there is a story that the gods transferred (rubbed off) their sin to the Apyas and then</p>

<p>POLYGAMY, POLYANDRY AND RIGHTS &amp;</p>
<p>AND DUTIES ON MARRIAGE</p>
<p>Polygamy: Though monogamy 127seems to have been the ideal and was probably the rule, the Vedic literature is full of references to polygamy. Rg. X. 145 (same as Atharvaveda III. 18) is a hymn meant as a charm for weaping the husband&rsquo;s affections from a co-wife. It occurs in the Ap. M. P. (I. 15 ) and Āp. gp. IX. 6-8 prescribes it for winning over the husband to oneself and for causing estrangement between him and one&rsquo;s co-wife. Rg. X. 1878 159 is a hymn attributed to Saci, wife of Indra, who claims to have vanquished and killed her co-wives and to rule supreme over Indra and all men. This hymn also occurs in Āp. M. P. (I. 16 ) and is prescribed by the Ap. gr. (IX. 9) as a charm always to be repeated by a wife for sup pressing ber co wives. In &amp; verge (Rg. I. 105. 8) Trita who had fallen into a well declares the rib-like sides of the well) cause me pain all round as co-wives make it too hot ( for the husband or for themselves )* 1872The Tai. S. (VI. 6. 4.3) gives a dogmatic and somewhat picturesque explanation of polygamy that &lsquo;on one sacrificial post he passes round two girdles, so one man secures two wives; that he does not pass one girdle round two posts, so one wife does not obtain two husbands&rsquo;.

<p>sama 1874 time&rsquo;. The Tai. Br. (III. 8. 4.) when speaking of the Asya</p>
<p>medha says &lsquo;the wives anoint (the horse); wives are indeed a form of prosperity&rsquo; 175. In the Sat. Br. (XIII. 4. 1.9., S. B. E. vol. 44, p. 349 ) it is said, &lsquo;four 1978 wives are in attendance viza the consecrated queen (mahisi), the favourite wife (vavata), the discarded wife (parivṛktā or parivṛkti) and the palāgalı ( who is low-born)&rsquo;. The Tai. 8. I. 8. 9 refers to the mabiṣi and parivrkti. In the Vaj. S. (23. 24, 26, 28) there are verses which are addressed to the mahiṣi, vāvātā and parivrkti by the brahmā, udgāta and hotā priests respectively. Hariscandra is said to have had a hundred wives (Ait. Br. 33.1). It is not to be supposed that polygamy was confined only to kings and nobles. The great philosopher Yājñavalkya bad two wives, Katyayani who was worldly-ininded and Maitreyi who tbirsted for the knowledge of brabma and immortality (Br. Up. IV. 5, 1-2 and II. 4.1).</p>
<p>In the times of the sūtras, some sages wanted to hold up a high ideal. The Ap. Dh. S. (II. 5.11.12-13) declares that when &amp; man has a wife who is endowed with dharms and progeny, he shall not marry another wife; but if any one of the two (dharma and progeny) is wanting (in the case of the wife), he may marry another before he has consecrated the sacred srauta fires. In another place Ap. (I. 10. 28. 19) prescribes that one who abandons bis (faultless ) wife should put on the skin of an ass with the hair outside and should beg for alms at seven houses for six months. in Narada ( stripumsar.95)</p>

<p>recommends that the king should bring round to the proper path by inflicting heavy fines a husband who abandons a wife that is obedient, not harsh of tongue, vigilant (in household work), chaste and endowed with sons. Even Kaug. (III. 2) prescribes that a husband should wait for eight years ( before marrying another) if his wife gives birth to no child after one delivery or is sonless or is barren; he should wait for ten if she bears only still-born children, twelve years if she gives birth to daughters only. Then if he is anxious for a son he may marry another. If he violates these rules he must pay her gratuity, some wealth as stridhana and money (prescribed to be given) on supersession and besides a fine (to the king ) of 24 paṇas&rsquo;. 1878 So far Kautilya appears to have only stated the ideal, because he follows up this remark by another statement which probably represented the commonly held popular view *a man may marry several wives after giving sulka and stridhana to those to whom nothing had been given at the time of marriage and money on supersession (adhivedanika ) and suitable provision for livelihood; for women are (married ) for prooreating sons. Though Ap. and others held up the ideal of monogamy and Nārada and others prescribed &amp; fine for marrying a second wife without sufficient cause, it is extremely doubtful whether a man was ever punished by the king for so doing. Manu V. 80 and Yāj. I. 80 both say that a husband may supersede a wife (and marry another) if she drinks wine, suffers from a disease (of long standing), is deceitful, is extravagant in expenditure, speaks harsh words, and gives birth to female children only. Manu V. 81 and Baud. Dh. S. II, %. 65 allow a husband to marry another woman at once if the first is barsh of tongue. Devala 1878 quoted in the Gr. R. says that the sūdra may have only one wife, &amp; vaisya two, a kṣatriya three and a brāhmana four, but a king may have as many as he desires. This only reflected the prevailing practice of kings.

<p>the duty owed to the first husband would be a great adharma in the case of women.&rsquo; The Mahabharata (Mausala-parva V. 6) tells us that Vasudeva 1281 ( Krona) had sixteen thousand wives. Several kings had in historio times as many as a hundred wives. For example, the Cedi king Gāngeyadeva alias Vikramāditya is said to have obtained mukli ( salvation) at Prayaga with his hundred wives 1282 (vide Jabalpur plate of Yaśaḥkarpadeva dated 1122 A. D. in E. I. vol. II. p. 4 and the Khaira plates of the same king in E. I. vol. XII. p. 205). In Bengal the evils of Kulinism are well known. The reasons for this treatment of women were mapy, such as the great spiritual importance of sons, early marria ges and consequent illiteracy of women, the spread of the idea of the ceremonial impurity of women and their being equated with gūdras and lastly the idea of the complete dependence of women on men. One must not be carried away, however, by the notion that marrying many wives was either very common or was not looked</p>
<p>down upon. Steele (in &lsquo;Law and Custom of Hindoo Oastes,&rsquo; first published in 1826 ) who had the most unique opportunities for observing the practices of numerous castes in the Dekhan in the first decades of the 19th century writes (p. 168, ed. of 1868)&lsquo;a man may marry as many wives as his inclination or circumstances allow. Marriages in succession, in consequence of the death of a former wife, are very common; but polygamy is not usual except on account of the barrenness of the first wife. It is practised in the Koonbee castes&rsquo;. Vide also Imperial Gazetteer of India, Vol. I (ed. of 1907 ) P. 482 &lsquo;Although in theory polygamy is allowed, in practice a second wife is rarely taken while the first is alive and in India as a whole there are only 1011 wives to every 1000 husbands so that even if no husbands have more than two wives all but 11 per thousand must be monogamous&rsquo;. The state of the modern case law is unsatis factory. The Bombay High Court has held that the mere fact that the husband has married a second wife would not entitle the first wife to refuse to stay with the husband. Vide Motilal V. Chanchal, 4 Bom, L. R. 107. In Virasami v. Appasami, 1 Madras High Court Reports, p. 375, the court held that a Hindu may marry any number of wives, although he may have a wife or wives living.

<p>not the ideal or the view of the best writers, nor is such a view held by the majority of Indian jurists of anoient and medieval times. Modern opinion of educated people is most favourable to making marriages monogamous and efforts are being made to secure absolute monogamy by legislative action. For example, the Madras Nambudri Act ( Madras Act XXI of 1933) forbids &amp; Nambudri brāhmana from inarrying a second wife when the first is living except in three cases viz. (1) when the first wife is afflicted with an incurable disease for over five years, (2) when she has not borne a child within ten years of marriage, and (3) when she becomes an outcast.</p>
<p>Polyandry The passages cited above (note 1274) from the Ait. Br. and the Tai. S. that a woman cannot have several husbands at the same time make it olear that in those ancient times polyandry was unheard 1288 of. Not a single Vedic passage can be cited which clearly refers to the practice of polyandry. The most glaring example of polyandry in Sanskrit literature is that of Draupadi as the wife of the five Pāṇdavas. Probably the tradition was too firmly rooted to allow the author to ignore it. The Mahābhārata shows that all were shocked by the resolve of Yudhiṣthira to make Draupadi the wife of the five brothers. Dhrstadyumna (Adiparva &ldquo;384 195. 27-29) tries vehemently to dissuade Yudhisthira, who tries to justify his action on the ground of ancient practice and the agreement of the brothers to share everything that any one of them may secure. But Yudhisthira could 1388 ferret out ( Adi. chap. 196 ) only two instances (rather mythical) in support of the practice viz. of Jaṭilā Gautami ( who bad seven sages as husbands ) and of Vārkṣi who had ten Prācetasa brothers as husbands. It is this fact that has led many scholars to regard the Paṇdus as a non-Aryan tribe somehow grafted on the Aryan stock and represented as relatives of the Kauravas by the editor of the</p>

<p>Mahabharata. This too also sounds somewhat far-fetohed, Kumārilabhatta in bis Tantra vārtika cuts this Gordian knot by putting forward three explanations, one of which boldly assorts that there were many Draupadis very similar to each other and so the epic figuratively speaks of one Draupadi only. &ldquo;286 There were really five Draupadis (and not one) married separately to the five Pāndavas. In the Dharmaśāstra works there are traces of the knowledge of the practice of polyandry. Ap. Dh, S. (II. 10. 27.2-4) refers to it&rsquo;One shall not make over (his wife) to strangers (for &amp; son by niyoga), but only to one who is a gagotra ; for they declare that a bride is given to the family (of brothers and not to one brother alone); that (niyoga) is forbidden on account of the weakness of men&rsquo;s senses,&rsquo; Similarly Bṛhaspati, while illustrating the proposition that the king should not disturb popular usages even though they may be improper, cites several such practices among which he mentions ' In some other countries there is the most reprehensible practice of a brother taking ( as wife ) the widow of his deceased brother, and the practice of delivering &amp; maiden to a family ; similarly among the Pārasikas ( Persiang) matches with a mother are seen &lsquo;.1287 Dr. Jolly is wrong in thinking that Bphaspati refers to polyandry as practised in the south. Bphaspati first referred to the practice of marrying a maternal uncle&rsquo;s daughter as prevalent amongst the southerners ( dākṣinātyas ) in his day and then adds that a practice of giving a girl to the family is in vogue in other countries. So he clearly means countries other than those of the dā kṣiṇātyas. Prof. Keith appears to follow Dr. Jolly without any independent examination of the original passage (in E. R. E. vol. 8 on marriage, p. 453). Just as Bphaspati refers to the Pārasīkss, he speaks of polyandry as current among other countries ( but not Aryan India). There are two types of polyandry, 1888 one matriarchal ( where a woman forms simultaneous alliances with two or more men who are not necessarily relations of each other and therefore succession is</p>

The former practice once prevailed among the Nairs on the Malabar coast, but it has now died out. The latter form of polyandry is still to some extent found in Kumaon, Garhwal and among peoples in the Himalayan area up to Assam.1489 Pandit Bhagwanlal Indraji (I. A, vol. 8, p. 88) says that in Kumaun between the Tons and Jumna river about Kalsi, Rajputs, brābmanas and sūdras all practise polyandry and the children are attributed to the eldest brother who is alive. Nilakantha, 1290 the commentator of the Mahābhārata, raises ( on Adiparva 104. 35 ) the question about Draupadi&rsquo;s marrying five husbands and refers to the practice among very low castes in his day of one woman having two or three husbands.</p>
<p>Mutual rights and duties of husband and wife</p>
<p>Manu (IX. 101-102 ) lays down in a conoise form the obli. gations of husband and wife viz. &lsquo;they should not prove false to each other till death ( as regards dharma, artha and kāma) and that their constant endeavour should be not to be separate from each other and not to break faith with each other (as to those three goals of human life)&rsquo;. The detailed rights and duties of the husband and wife will be unfolded as we proceed.</p>
<p>The first duty of the husband and the privilege of the wife was to require and to give respectively her co-operation in all religious acts. This has been so from the most ancient times, Io Rg. 1. 72.5 it is said &ldquo;891 that &lsquo;they, accompanied by their wives, worshipped the fire who is worthy of worship&rsquo;. In another place it is said &lsquo;when you make the husband and wife of one mind, they anoint thee with gbee like a well-placed friend&rsquo;. In the Tai. Br.

<p>both ), they two became yoked like oxen to the sacrifice; may the two be of one mind and destroy their foes; may they attain non-aging light in heaven&rsquo;. The same verse with slight variations occurs in the Kathaka Sam. V. 4 and is relied upon by Sabara on Jaimini VI. 1. 21. This indicates that they were supposed to enjoy the fruits of their actions together. We saw above (p. 551) how in the Aśvamedha the wife anoints the horse, how in marriage the bride offers handfuls of fried grain into fire. It has already been seen (note 1208 ) that the Ap. Dh. S. (IL. 6. 13. 17-19 ) requires that from the time of marriage the husband and wife work together in religious acts, that they share the reward of such acts toget ber and that they both bave dominion over the wealth of the family and that the wife can make gifts in the absence of the husband if occasion necessitates. The Āśv. gr. (1.8.5) prescribes that the fire kindled at marriage is carried by the married pair to their home (in a vessel ) and that( I. 9. 1-8) since the day of marriage, the husband should worship the domestic fire himself or his wife or his son or his daughter or pupil (mey offer worship in bis absence), that if fire goes out, some teachers say that the wife should observe a fast, the domestio fire should be worshipped in the evening with an ahuli and the formula * agbaye syāba&rsquo; and in the morning with an āhuti and the formula &lsquo;sūryāya svābā&rsquo; and there is to be a second oblation each time silently (to Prajāpati). According to the commen tator some said that the wife and daughter oould not perform the homa as they had no privilege to learn mantras, that they could only kindle the fire, while others said they could do so. In the grhya fire kindled at marriage one was to offer the daily mahāyajāas (Gaut. 5. 6-8) and as regards baliharana, Gobbila gp. (I. 4. 16-19) says that both husband and wife should offer balis, or a brābmana may offer for them, or the wife may offer in the evening and the husband in the morning 1203.

<p>offer balis, but without mantras. This shows that though gradu ally women began to lose the right to repeat Vedic mantras ( as shown by Manu), still she had a hand in the religious rites. She had to perform many acts in sacrifices, such as unbusking grain in sthallpāka (vide Hir. gr. I. 23. 3), washing the slaughtered animal (compare Sat, Br, III. 8.2 and Gobhila gr III. 10. 29), looking at the ajya in śrauta sacrifioes. The Pūrvamlmārsā 1994 (VI. 1. 17-21) establishes that both husband and wife own property and should join together in performing sacrifices, but that the male sacrificer alone is ordinarily to do every act in all religious ceremonies except such matters as are expressly declared to be performed by the wife also or alone (as e. g. observing celibacy, uttering benediction &amp;c.). It is on account of the necessity of associating the wife in all religious aots that the hero Rāina was compelled to celebrate sacrifices with a golden image of Sita by his side.1295 Pāṇini (IV, 1.33 ) derives the word patni and says that it can be only applied to a wife who shares in the sacrifice (and its roward ). It follows that wives who are not or cannot join with their husbands in yajñas are only jāyās or bhāryās (but not patnis). The Mahābhāsya say81296 that the wife of a sūdra is called patni only by analogy (ag &amp; śūdra himself has no adhikāra for yajña, his wife can much less bave it). It is on account of this close association of the wife in all sacrifices (either srauta or smārta) that the wife if she dies before her husband is burnt with the sacred fire or fires and with the sacrifioial vessels and implements (Manu V. 167-168, Yāj. I. 89). The Tai. Br. III. 7. 1 says &lsquo;half of the sacrifice is destroyed in the case of that sacrificer whose wife is (in her monthly course and therefore) unavailable on the sacrificial day.&lsquo;1897</p>
<p>But the wife is not authorized to do religious acts indepen dently of her husband or without his consent. Manu ( V. 155 = Viṣnu Dh. S. 25. 15 ) ordains &lsquo;there is no separate yajāa for</p>

<p>women ( independently of the husband ) nor vrata ( vows) nor fasts (without his consent).&rsquo; Similarly Kātyāyana propounds 128 a sweeping rule &lsquo;whatever &amp; woman does to secure spiritual benefit after death without the consent of her father (when she is unmarried), or her husband or her son, becomes fruitless for the purpose intended.&rsquo; Vide also Veda-Vyāga smrti II. 19. The Nityācāra paddhati (p. 329 ) quotes Manu V. 155 and remarks that Manu&rsquo;s words are not to be taken literally but are only meant to extol the eminence of the husband.</p>
<p>Very detailed rules were laid down as to procedence among wives, if &amp; man married several women. Viṣnu Dh. 8. (26.1-4) concisely gives all the rules. 1299 If all the wives are of the same caste, then the wise whose marriage took place first was to be associated with the husband in all religious aots ; if a man had wives of different varnas ( when inter-caste marriages were allowed ) the wife of the same varna with the husband had precedence, though her marriage might have been later in date. If there is no wife of the same varne as himself, the husband may associate with himself in religious rites even a wife of the varna imme diately next to his own; but &amp; dvijali should never associate a śūdra wife with himself in religious ceremonies. Vide Madanapārijata p. 134 for similar rules, Vas. Db. S. 18. 18 expressly says &lsquo;a woman belonging to the dark varna (i. e. śūdra) is meant only for pleasure and not for performance of religious rites , 1300 Gobhila smrti (1. 103-104 ) contains rules similar to those in Viṣnu Dh. 8., Yāj. I. 88 and Veda-Vyāga IL 12 are to the same effect. Visvarūpa on Yāj. remarks that though the eldest wife alone is entitled to take part in religious rites, all wives (except a sūdra wife) may be cremated with the srauta fire. Vide Sm. C. I. p. 165. In the Pūrvami. māmsā ( IX, 3. 20-21 ) Jaimini discusses the question whether the direction in the Darka-pūrnamāsa &lsquo;patnim samnabya&rsquo; (having girt up the wife ) which employs the singular number</p>

<p>should be modified into the dual or plural when the sacrificer (in a model sacrifice or its modifications) has two or more wives and establishes that no change is required. The Trikāṇ damaṇdana 1801 (I. 43-44) says that there were three views when a man had several wives viz. some said that all should be associated with him in religious rites, others held that only the eldest wife of the same varṇa should be associated and the third view was that the husband should never associate with bimself &amp; wife whom he married for pleasure after he kindled the sacred fires. Manu (IX. 86-87 ) lays down that the wife of the same caste with the husband should always have precedence not only in the obligatory religious rites, but also in ministering to the pbysioal comfort of tbe husband and if a brāhmaṇa husband gets these done by a wife of another caste when the wife of the same caste is near, he becomes like a cāndāla.</p>
<p>From very ancient times one of the articles of faith was that a man was born with debts, that be owed three debts to sages, gods and pitṛs and tbat by brabmacarya (student-hood ), by performing yajñas and by procreating sons he freed himself from those three debts respectively. Vide 1308 Tai. S. VI. 3.10, 5, Sat. Bp. I. 7.2.11, Ait. Br. 33.1. The last very succinctly states the purposes served by a son viz. payment of the debt to ancestors, the securing of immortality and heaven. Rg, V.4. 10 (prajābhir agbe amrtatvam-aśyām) prays&rsquo;may I obtain immortality through progeny.&rsquo; Vas. Dh. 8. 17, 1-4 quotes these passages of the Tai. S., Ait. Br. and Rg. The Rg. X. 85. 45 invokes the blessing of ten sons on the newly married bride and the Rg. is full of the yearning for a son at every step. Vide Rg. I. 91, 20, I. 92. 13, III. 1, 23 &amp;c. Jaimini (VI. %. 31 ) 1303 discusses the passage of the Tai S. and arrives at the conclusion that the duties laid down in it are obligatory and not left to choice and Sabara adds another explanation that these duties are obliga tory on all dvijātis and the word &lsquo;brahmana&rsquo; is used in the</p>

<p>Tai. 8. as illustrative only, Manu (VI. 35 ) enjoins upon a man that he should not think of moksa ( release from saṁsāra) before he has paid off the three debts and (IX. 106 ) further Bays that by the very birth of the eldest son a man becomes free from the debt owed to ancestors. Manu (IX, 137 ), Vas. 17. 5, Viṣnu Dh. 8. 15. 46 contain the same verse proclaiming that &amp; man attains all (heavenly ) worlds by means of a son and Manu IX. 138, Adi. 129. 14, Viṣnu Dh. S. 15.44 declare that a putra is so called because he saves his father from the hell called put. The Nirukta II. 11 1304 also derives the word pulra similarly. Further the water and piṇdas ( balls of cooked rice ) offered by the son to his father and other deceased ancestors were supposed to be of great efficacy for the peace of the souls of the departed. The Viṣnu Dh. S. 85, 70,1305 Vanaparva 84. 97, Matsyapurāṇa 207.39 contain a verse one should desire to have many sons in the hope that one of them may repair to Gaya.&rsquo; On account of these several benefits conferred by a son, the highest importance was attached to the birth of a son. The wife helped &amp; man to discharge two of his debts, to the gods by associating with him in sacrifices and to the pitrs by procreating &amp; son or sons. Therefore the goal of the life of women was declared to be to get married and procreate sons. This was so much the cage from very ancient times that even the Sat. Br. (V.3. 2.2, S. B. E. vol. 41, p. 65 ) says that the sonless wife is possessed with Nir-sti (ill luck or Destruction). Manu (IX. 96 ) says &lsquo;women are created for procreation and men have to propagate ( the race ); therefore in the Veda it is declared that the wife shares in common (with the husband ) the performance of religious duties&rsquo;. Nārada (stripumsa v.19) also declares that women are created for ( procreating ) children. It was on account of these ideas about the goal of woman&rsquo;s life and the supreme importance of a son that the smṛtis and dharma-sātra works recommended or allowed the husband to marry &amp; second time even when the first wife was living.</p>
<p>All the smptis, purāṇas and the digesta devote a great deal of space to the duties of a wife. It would be impossible to set them out in detail. A fow striking passages alone will be cited. All are agreed that the foremost duty of a wife is to obey her</p>

<p>husband and to honour him as her god. In the Sat. Br. 1306 princess Sukangā when married to the old and decrepit sage Cyavana to mollify the sage who had been wronged by her brothers says&rsquo; I shall not forsake my husband, while he is alive, to whom my father gave me&rsquo; (IV. 1. 5. 9). Saṅkha-Likhita 1309 say a wife should not hate her husband even if he be impotent (or have swollen testicles), patita (guilty of mahāpātaka and 80 an outoast), devoid of a limb or diseased, since the husband is the god of women.' Manu declares (V. 154)&lsquo;a virtuous wife should serve her husband as if he were a god, whether he be of evil character, or lustful ( loving another woman ) or devoid of good qualities Yāj. I. 77 enjoins upon women this is the highest duty (dharma) of women that they should obey their husband&rsquo;s words ; if he is guilty of some mortal sin, they should wait till he is purified (and thereafter be dependent on his words )&rsquo;. The Rāmāyaṇa (Ayodhya-kāṇda 24. 26-27) remarks &lsquo;the husband is the god and the master of the wife, while she is alive and she obtains the highest heaven by serving her husband.&rsquo; The Mahābhs rata very frequently barps upon the duties of wives. 1308 The Anuśāsana parva 146. 55 says the husband is the god of a woman, her (sole) relative, her goal'; the Āśvamedbika. parya 90. 51 declares the husband is the highest deity.' &ldquo;The father gives only what is limited, the brother and the son do the same; what woman would not worship the husband who gives what is unlimited or immeasurablel' (Sāntiparva 148. 6–7).

<p>husband fs voiced even by poets like Kalidasa, 1309 who makes one of the pupils of Kanya kay about Sakuntala this is your wife, abandon her or accept her, since all-round domination of the husband over the wife is proper.' Manu V. 150-156, Yāj. I. 83-87, Viṣnu Db, S, 25. 2 ff, Vanaparva 233. 19-58 (Draupadi as the speaker ), Anuśāsana 123 (Sandili declares the conduct of virtuous wives ), Veda-Vyāsa-smrti II. 20-32 ( wife&rsquo;s duties from morning till night ), Vṛddha-Hārita XI. 84 ff (wife&rsquo;s duties from morning), Sm, C. ( vyavahāra section) p. 249 ff, Madanapārijāta pp. 192-195 and other nibandhas dwell at length upon the duties of the wife. A few of such duties may be indicated here.</p>
<p>According to Manu V. 150 &lsquo;a wife should always present &amp; smiling face, should be alert and clever in her domestio duties, sbould keep domestic vessels well burnished and clean and should not be extravagant in spending.&rsquo; Manu IX. 11 asks the husband to set to his wife the task of con serving the wealth acquired and looking to its expenditure, of keeping things clean, of the performance of religious aots, of cooking food and of taking care of household paraphernalia. Manu (IX. 13) adds that drinking wine, company of bad people, staying away from the husband, wandering about ( to tirthas or elsewhere ), sleep (by day), staying in the house of strangers-these sir spoil married women. Adiparva 74. 12 gives1310 expression to the popular notion that people do not like married women staying with their paternal relatives for a long time away from their husbands, since such &amp; stay leads to loss of good name and character. The same sentiment is echoed by Kalidasa in the Sakuntala (V. 17). The Markaṇdeya-purāṇa 77. 19 is to the same effect. Yāj. ( I. 83 and 87 ) requires the wife to keep household utensils and furniture in their proper places, to be clever, to have a smiling face, to be unextravagant, to be dovoted to doing what is agreeable and beneficial to the husband, to show respect to her father-in-law and mother-in-law by clasping their feet; to</p>

<p>husband. 1818 Manu (VIII. 361) prescribes the fine of a suvarna for a man speaking with a woman with whom he is forbidden to speak and Yāj. II. 285 prescribes a fine of one hundred paṇas in the case of a woman who is forbidden to speak with a man (by her husband or father &amp;o.) and a fine of two hundred panas in the case of the man who speaks with a woman with whom he is forbidden to speak. Bṛbaspati 1313 says that a wife should get up from bed before her husband and elders, should partake of food and condiments after they have eaten, should occupy &amp; seat lower than that of the husband or elders. &lsquo;A wife oan engage in vratas, fasts, observances and worship (of god &amp;o.) with the permission of her husband&rsquo; Bay Saṅkha-Likbita.1314 The Purāṇas frequently descant on stridharma. A few specimens may be noted here. The Bhāgavata VII. 11. 29 says that the wife who looks upon her husband as the god Hari dwells in the world of Hari and revels with her husband. The Skanda Purāpa (Brahma-khaṇda, Dharmāranya section, chap. 7) has &amp; long description of a pativratū &lsquo;she should not repeat the name of her husband, 88 such conduct leads to the increase of the husband&rsquo;s life and sbould Dover take the name of another male (v. 18), even when she is loudly blamed (by the husband) she does not cry loudly, even when beaten she is smiling (v. 19). A pativratā should always use turmeric, kunkuma, sindūra, lamp black (for the eye ), a bodice, tāmbūla, auspicious orna ments, and should braid her hair (vv. 28-29). The Padma-purana (Sṭsti-khanda, chap. 47, v. 55) says that that wife is pativrata who in doing work is like a slave, like a helaira in affording sexual pleasure, like a mother in offering food and like a counsellor in adversity.</p>
<p>Special rules of conduct were laid down for a wife whose husband was away from home on a journey. Saṅkha-Likbita (quoted by Aparārka p. 108, Sm. O., vysvahara p. 253) contain a long statement about what suoh a wife should not do &lsquo;women whose husbands are away from home should avoid amusements of swing and dance, seeing pictures, applying upguents to the body, walking in parks, sleeping in open places (or uncovered).</p>

<p>partaking of sumptuous food and drink, playing with a ball, fragrant resins and perfumes, flowers, ornaments, ceremonial brushing of the teeth, collyrium ( in the eyes ).&rsquo; Yāj. (I. 84 ) puts these briefly &lsquo;a woman whose husband is gone to another country should give up play, the adornment of the body, Visiting samājas (note 986 above) and festivals, laughing, going to the house of a stranger.&rsquo; The Anuśāsana-parva 1315 ( 123. 17) indicates that a wife whose husband is gone abroad does not apply eyesalve or rocana ( yellow pigmont) to her body, does not take a ceremonial bath and does not use flowers, unguents or ornaments. Manu (IX. 74-75 ) requires the husband when going abroad to make provision for the wife&rsquo;s maintenance, since a woman without some means of livelihood, though originally virtuous, may go astray and adds &lsquo;when the husband goes abroad after providing for maintenance, the wife should live thereby and abide by the restrictions (laid down for such wives); if he goes away without making provision for her maintenance she should maintain herself by crafts (such as spinning ) which are unblamable.&rsquo; The Viṣnu Dh. S. (25. 9-10) contains similar rules. The Veda-Vyāsa-smrti (II. 52 ) enjoins upon a wife whose husband is gone abroad&rsquo; her&quot;816 face should look pale and distressed, she should not embellish her body, she should be devoted to her husband, should be without (full) meal, and should emaciate her body.' The Trikāṇdamandana 1317 (I. 80-81 and 85 ) says that when the husband is gone abroad the wife may with the help of a priest perform the daily duties of agnihotra, the obligatory iṣtis and pitsyajña, but should not perform soma sacrifices.</p>
<p>The rewards of the wife&rsquo;s single-minded devotion to her husband and her rigid observance of the rules of conduct prescribed for her are stated at great length in smrti works. Manu (IX. 29-30 - Manu V. 165 and 164 ) says that woman who does not prove faithless to her husband in thought, word and deed (lit. body ) secures the ( heavenly ) worlds together with her busband and is spoken of as a sādhvi' (a virtuous woman, a patitratā); but by proving faithless to her husband a</p>

<p>woman incurs consure in this world, is born as a female jackal (in the next life ) and is afflicted with very bad diseases.' Yaj. ( I. 75 and 87) declares that the woman, who does not approach another while the husband is living or after bis death and who is intent on doing what is agreeable and beneficial to her husband, who is of good conduct and has restrained her Benbes, attains glory in this world and plays with Umā (the wife of Siva) in heaven. Bșhaspati&quot;818 defines &amp; pativratā as one who is distressed when her husband is distressed, who is delighted when her husband is in delight, who is emaciated and wears dirty clothes when her husband has gone on a journey and who dies on the death of her husband.</p>
<p>In the Mahābharata and the purāṇas byperbolical des criptions of the power of the pativralā occur at every step. Vide Vana-parva 63 where we are told (vv. 38-39) that when Damayanti oursed by her faithfulness to her husband the young hunter who had evil designs on her, he fell down a dead man. In the Anuśāsanaparva 123 Sāṇdill who1318 had attained heavenly worlds tells Sumanā Kaikeyi how she reached that state with out wearing kāṣāyas ( dyed garments worn by samnyāsins) or bark garments and without having matted hair or without tonsuring her head (as ascetics do ), but by strictly following the rules laid down for virtuous wives, such as not addressing harsh words to their husband, abandoning all food that the husband did not like. Anuśāsana (146. 4-6) names several pativratās of ancient times and the following verses dilate upon the rules of conduot for virtuous wives. The story of Savitri in the Vanaparva ( 293-299 ) illustrates the power of &amp; pativratā, who wrung back even from Yama, the dread god of Death, the life of her husband. 1380 Sāvitri and Sitā have been held by the women of India for thousands of years as the</p>

<p>highest ideals of womanly virtue, to which they have always endeavoured to approach and one may say that Indian women generally have most successfully lived up to that bigh and ennobling ideal that was set before them. Vanaparva (205–206) tells the story of a learned brāhmaṇa, who by his mere angry look made a female crane die when the latter voided its fueces on to the head of the brāhmaṇa and who was rebuked by a pativratā that the latter was not a crane, when the brāhmaṇa tried to frighten the virtuous woman for her tardiness in welcoming him as a guest and for looking only after her husband. The Salyaparva (63) narrates how awful the power of a pati vrata like Gandbārl is in that she can, if she choose, burn the world, she can stop even the motions of the sun and 1821 the moon. The Skanda-purāṇa III ( Brahma-khanda, Brahmāranya section chap. 7) first names ( verses 14-15 ) several pativratās like Arundhati, Anasuya, Savitri, Sandilya, Satya, Menā and then waxes eloquent over the tremendous spiritual power of a pativrata &lsquo;just as a snake-charmer 388 forcibly draws out from a hole &amp; snake, 80 &amp; pativrata snatches away her husband&rsquo;s life from the messengers of Death and reaches heaven with ber husband and the messengers of Death, on seeing the pativrata, beat a hasty retreat.&rsquo;</p>
<p>As the foremost duty of the wife was to honour and serve the husband, she must always stay with him and she had a right of residence in the house. A wife was further entitled to be maintained in the house by the husband. A verse quoted by Medhātithi on Manu III. 62 and IV. 251 and by the Mit. on Yaj. I. 224 and II. 175 and which occurs in some M88. as a spurious verse after Manu XI. 10 says &lsquo;Manu declares that one must maintain one&rsquo;s aged parents, &amp; virtuous wife and a minor son by doing even a hundred bad acts&rsquo;, 1823 Dakṣa</p>

<p>Rights and Duties on Marriage</p>

<p>II. 36 ( = Laghu-Aśvalāyana 1884 1. 74 ) defines posyavarga ( persons whom &lsquo;every one, however poor, is bound to maintain ) as follows: &lsquo;the parents, the guru, the wife, children and a helpless man who has taken shelter with one, a guest and fire constitute posyavarga.&rsquo; Manu VIII. 389 prescribes that the man who abandons and does not maintain bis parents, wife, and son, when they are not outcasted, should be fined 600 papas by the king. Yāj. I. 74 requires the husband to maintain &amp; wife whom he has superseded in the same way as before, otherwise he would be guilty of great sin. Yāj. I. 76 says that if a man abandoned a wife who was obedient, diligent, the mother of a son, and agreeable in speech, he was to be made to give one-third of his property to the wife, but if he had no property he had to maintain her. Nārada ( stripunsa 95 ) has &amp; similar provision. The Viṣnu Dh. S. V. 163 made the husband punishable like a thief, if he abandoned his wife. The husband was required by Yaj. I. 81 to be devoted to his wife, since women are to be guarded ( against falling into error ). Vide Yāj. I. 78 also. Manu IV. 133 forbids adultery with another&rsquo;s wife and Manu IV.134(=Anusāsana 104.21 and Mārkandeya-purana 34. 62-63) observes that there is nothing that harms one&rsquo;s life as much as adultery. Visvarūpa 1885 on Yaj. I. 80 points out that the guarding of a wife from evil can be secured only by being devoted to her and not by beating her, as, if the husband were to beat her, it might endanger her life. Manu (IX. 5-9) also calls upon men to guard women, and ( in IX. 10-12 ) says that they cannot be guarded by imprisonment or force, but by engaging them in looking to the income and expenditure, the furniture, beauty and purity of the house and the cooking and by inouloating on them the value of a virtuous life. In spite of this the husband possessed certain powers of physical correction over the wife which were the same as those possessed by a teacher over a pupil or a father over a son, viz. he could administer beating with a rope or a thin piece of bamboo on the back but never on the head. Vide Manu VIII. 299-300 (oited above on p. 363 ) which are the same as Matsyapurāna 227. 152-154. It will be seen that about two thousand years ago Manu did not confer</p>

<p>greater powers of correction and restraint of the wife on the husband than the Common Law of England allowed to husbands even in the 18th century.1428</p>
<p>As it was the husband&rsquo;s duty to provide residence and maintenance for the wife and as the wife was bound to stay with the busband, it follows that either party could after marriage enforce his or her rights in a court of law if the other party refused to perform her or his duties. In modern times a suit for restitution of conjugal rights can be brought and the deoree can be executed against the wife by the attachment and sale of her property ( if she has any), but not by detention in civil jail and against the husband by the court ordering the husband to make periodical payments of money for the maintenance of the wife and securing such payments by creating a charge on his property (vide Civil Procedure Code of 1908 Order 21 rules 32 and 33). To such &amp; suit by the husband Indian Courts have recognised certain valid defences, such as desertion, cruelty or such conduct as endangers the health of the wife, change of religion, or keeping a concubine in the house or the husband&rsquo;s being afflicted with a loathsome disease (like leprosy ). Vide Bai Premkunvar V. Bhika 5 Bom. H. C. R. (A, C, J.) p. 209 ( leprosy ), Yamunabai v. Narayan 1 Bom. 164 ( cruelty ), Paigi V. Sheo Narain 8 All, 78, Dular Koer v. Dwarkanath 34 Cal. 971, Bai Jivi v. Narsingh 51 Bom. 329. Where the courts make the husband pay maintenance, they are in principle following Yāj. I. 76 and Nārada (p. 569). Vide Binda v.

<p>consortium i. e. the wife was not to refuse herself to the husband and if she did so ber delinquenoy was to be proclaimed in the village and she was to be driven from the house 1807</p>
<p>The humane character of the legislation of the Indian sages is seen by the fact that even for adultery they do not allow the husband to drive the wife out of the house and to abandon her. Gaut. 22.35 prescribes that a wife who violates her duty of chastity must undergo a penance, but she should be kept under guard and be given food. Yāj. ( 1.70,72 ) declares * an adulterous woman should be deprived of her authority (over servants &amp;o.), should be made to wear dirty clothes, should be given food just sufficient to enable her to live, should be treated with scorn and made to lie on the ground (not on a cot); a woman becomes pure from adultery when she has her monthly period after that, but if she conceives in adulterous intercourse she may be abandoned and also when she is guilty of the murder of her foetus or of her husband or of some sin that makes her an outcast&rsquo;. The Mit. on Yāj. I. 72 draws attention to the text of Vasiṣtha XXI. 12 &lsquo;the wives of brābmaṇas, 1328 kṣatriyas and vaiśyas who commit adultery with a śūdra may be purified by a penance in case no child is born (of the inter course), but not otberwise&rsquo; and remarks that the words of Yājñavalkya are to be understood in the same sense i. e, a wife is to be abandoned only if she be in adultery with a sūdra; and further that the abandonment consists in not allowing her to participate in religious rites and conjugal matters, but she is not to be cast on the streets; she is to be kept apart guarded in a room and to be given food and raiment (as stated in Yaj. III. 297). Vasiṣtha XXI. 10 says that only four (types of) wives are to be abandoned viz. one who has intercourse with the husband&rsquo;s pupil and with the husband&rsquo;s guru, and especially one who attempts to kill her husband and who commits</p>

<p>adultery with a man of degraded caste (like a leather-worker). Nārada 1328 ( strīpumsa v. 91 ) says &lsquo;when a woman commits adul. tery her hair shall be shaven, sbe shall have to lie on a low bed, shall receive bad food and clothing and her occupation will be the removal of sweepings of the husband&rsquo;s house&rsquo;. Gaut. 23. 14, Santi-parva 165, 64 and Manu VIII. 371 are more harsh on a woman who has intercourse with a low-caste man, i. e. she is to be punished by the king with being devoured by dogs. Veda-Vyāsa (II. 49-50 ) says that &lsquo;a wife 330 who is guilty of adultery should be kept in the house but void of her rights of associating in religious and conjugal matters and of her rights over property, and should be treated with scorn; but when she has had monthly course after the act of adultery (and does not repeat it), the husband should allow her the usual rights of a wife as before.&rsquo; Manu XI. 177 asks the husband to confine an exceedingly corrupt wife to one room and compel her to perform the penance'331 prescribed for males in cases of adultery. Vide Atri V. 1-5, Parabara IV, 20 and XI. 87 and Bșhad-Yama IV. 36.</p>
<p>Under the English law, if the wife commits adultery the husband&rsquo;s obligation to maintain her ceases altogether un less he had connived at it or condoned it. 1838</p>
<p>The following propositions can be deduced from the texts cited above. (1) There is no absolute right of abandonment of wife in the husband on the ground of adultery ;(2) Adultery is ordinarily an upapātaka (a minor sin ) and can be atoned for by appropriate penance undergone by the wife; (3) the wife who has committed adultery but has undergone penance is to be restored to all the ordinary rights of wives (vide Vas. XXI. 12, Yāj. I. 72, Mit. thereon and Aparārka p. 98);(4) as long as the adulteress has not undergone penance, she is to be given in the house itself starving maintenance and to be depriv. ed of all her rights as wife (Yāj. I. 70, Santiparva 165, 63 );</p>

<p>Rights and Duties on Marriage</p>
<p>573</p>
<p>(5) a wife, who commits adultery with a śūdra or has had &amp; child thereby, who is guilty of killing her foetus or of attempt to kill the husband or guilty of one of the deadly sins (maha pātakas ), is to be deprived of her right to participation in religious rites or conjugal matters and is to be kept confined in a room or in a hut near the house and to be given starving maintenance and poor apparel, even after she undergoes penance ( Vas. XXI. 10, Manu XI. 177, Yāj. III. 297-98 and Mit. thereon); (6) that wives who are not guilty of acts men tioned in Yāj. I. 72, III, 297-298, Vas. 21. 10 or 28. 7 are to be given starving maintenance and residence near the house even if they do not perform penance (vide Mit. on Yāj. III. 298); (7) wives who are guilty of the acts mentioned in Yāj. I. 72, III. 297-298, if they refuse to perform penance, are to be refused even starving maintenance and residence near the husband&rsquo;s house (Mit. on Yāj. III. 298 ). The propositions about maintenance set out here are accepted as the modern Hindu Law by the courts in India. 1383</p>
<p>It has been shown above (p. 518) that Ap. postulated the identity of husband and wife in religious matters and Manu IX. 45 declares that the husband is one with his wife. But this identity of husband and wife was not accepted by the ancient sages for secular or legal purposes. The rights of husband and wife as to each other&rsquo;s property and the liability of each for the debts of the other will be dealt with later on in detail. It may suffice here to point out that the wife was not ordinarily liable for the debts contracted by the husband nor was the husband liable for the debts contracted by the wife alone, unless the debt was for family purposes (Yāj. II. 46). Similarly the husband could exercise no dominion over the wife&rsquo;s own property (her stridhana or peculium ) except in a famine or for a necessary religious purpose, or in disease or when he was imprisoned (Yaj. II. 147). These rules prescribed centuries ago compare in their fairness or reasonableness most favourably with the rules of the English law 1334 ( as they prevailed before the Married Women&rsquo;s Property Act of 1882, 45 and 46 Viot. chap. 75 ), whereby the husband by the more faot of marriage acquired free-bold interest, during the joint lives of himself and</p>

<p>his wife, in all estates of inheritance and life estates of which she was seised at the marriage or became seised during coverture, and an absolute interest in all the wife&rsquo;s personal chattels.</p>
<p>Nārada 1888 ( stripumsa, V. 89 ) does not allow the husband or wife to lodge a complaint against one another with their relations or with the king. The Mit. on Yāj. II. 294 remarks &lsquo;though &amp; judicial proceeding between husband and wife as plaintiff and defendant before the king is forbidden, still, if the king comes to know personally or indirectly of wrong done by the one to the other, the king must bring round the husband or the wife to the path of duty by appropriate punishment, other wise 1326 the king incurs sin&rsquo;. There were certain matters of which the king could take cognisance without the complaint of anybody : they were called aparādhas ( they are ton ) among wbich were included the murder of a woman, varnasamkara, adultery, pregnancy of a widow from some person other than the husband, abortion 1337 &amp;c. We have seen (p. 569) that Yaj. I. 76, Narada (strīpumsa, v. 95 ) make the husband liable to pay one-third of his estate or a fine for deserting a virtuous wife and there are many such provisions about the matters affecting the husband and wife in which the king interfered. In England 1938 at Common Law a wife could not sue her husband in tort (till the Married Women&rsquo;s Property Act) nor could a husband sue the wife in tort.</p>
<p>We must now turn to the position of women in general and wives in partioular and the estimate of their character and worth made by anoient India. It has already been seen (p. 428) how the wife was looked upon as half of the husband, how in Vedio times women composed hymns and learnt the Vedas and how they co-operated with their busbands in all religious acts. On the whole their social position was much better ( except as to rights of property ) than what it became in later times. But</p>

<p>Position of women</p>
<p>575</p>
<p>even in the Vedio times there was an under-current of opinion which was hostile to women, sneered at them and treated them with scorn. Some of the passages from Vedic and classical Sanskrit literature eulogising women and the wife bave been set out above (pp. 428ff). The passages noted below inay be read in this connection. 1378 Vide Baud. Dh. S. II. 2. 63-64, Manu III. 55-62, Yaj. I. 71, 74, 78, 82, Vas. Dh. S. 28. 1-9, Atri vv. 140 141 and 193-198, Adiparva 74. 140-15%, Santiparva 144. 6 and 12-17, Anusāsana 46, Mārkandeyapurana 21. 69-76. The Kamasutra III. 2 says that women are like flowers ( kusuma sadharmāṇo hi yoṣitaḥ ). It has been seen (pp. 146–147) how way was to be made by all for the bride and the pregnant woman and it will be shown that the general opinion was that no woman was to be killed on any account (with one or two exceptions 1340 in ancient writers). Some of the smstikāras like Atri and Devala were so liberal as to say that women who had intercourse with one not of the same caste or who had conceived by such intercourse did not become outcasts, but only impure till delivery or next period when they became pure again and could be associated with, the child born of the adulterous connection being handed over to some one else for being brought up.1341 If a woman was raped she was not to be abandoned, but she became impure only till her next period ( Atri 197-198 ) and Devala ( 48-49) pres cribes purifications for a woman raped by mlecchas and concei. ving thereby. In the Sāntiparv8 267. 38 it is said that it is not the woman who is at fault, but it is the man who is at fault ( when the wonian goes astray). In the Varuṇapraghāsa 148</p>

<p>As against the high eulogy and considerate treatment of women a few passages unfavourable to women may be cited. We have already seen (p. 503) how woman was said to be &lsquo;falsehood&rsquo; incarnate (Maitrāyaniya S. I. 10.11). Rg. VIII. 33. 17 says the mind of woman is uncontrollable'; Rg. X. 95. 15 and Satapathe XL 5. 1. 9 declare there is no friendship with women and they have the hearts of hyænes' (addressed to Purūravas about Urvasi); Rg. V. 30. 9 &lsquo;women are the weapons and army of the dāsa&rsquo;. The Tai, S. VI. 5. 8. 2 1348 says therefore women are without strength, take no dāya (portion) and speak more weakly than even a wretched man'. This passage ( which really refers to women not being entitled to a portion of Soma drink) is relied upon by Baud, Dh, S. (II. 2. 53 ) and 1344 by Manu IX. 18 for prescribing the entire dependence of women on men, for depriving them of a share on partition or inheritance and of the privilege of Vedic mantras. The Sat. Br. (8. B. E. vol. 44. P. 446 ) says that woman, sūdra, a dog and a crow embody un truth, sin and darkness (XIV, 1. 1. 31). The same Brāhmaṇa (IV. 4. 2. 13, S. B. E. vol. 26, p. 366 ) remarks &lsquo;the wives being smitten (with ghee-the thunderbolt) and unmanned neither rule over themselves nor over dāya (share of pro perty ) 134. Another passage of the Satapatha (S. B. E. vol. 44, p. 300.) says &lsquo;He thereby makes women to be dependent, whence women are sure to be attendant upon man&rsquo;(XIII. 2.2.4). These passages establish that even in Vedio times women were often looked down upon, had no share in property and were dependent. The passages about the character of women contain no more than what male oynios and critics of all times and in all countries have attributed to women such as frailty, thy name is womanl&rsquo;.

<p>worse and worse as time went on, except as to rights of property. Gaut. 18. 1, Vas. Dh. S. V. 1 and 3, Manu V. 146–148 and IX, 2-3, Baud. Dh, S. II. %. 50-52, Nārada ( dayabhāga 31) all declare 1348 that women are not independent, but dependent in all matters on men and that in childhood, after marriage and in old age they are to be guarded by the father, the husband and the son respectively. Manu (IX, 2-3 ) refers to rakṣā (i. e. protection against harm or calamity ), while Manu V. 146–148 deolare a woman&rsquo;s dependence even in all domestic matters at all stages of her life on some male. Nārada ( dāyabhāga Yv. 28-30 ) adds 1347 when &amp; widow is sonless, her husband&rsquo;s relatives are the controlling authority as regards her main. tenance, the application ( of the husband&rsquo;s property ) and guarding her against harm; if there be no relative or sapindas of the husband, then a woman&rsquo;s father&rsquo;s family has control of her ; the creator assigned dependence to women as women even of good family fall into ruin by independence'. It has been seen above (pp. 561-562) that a woman&rsquo;s only concern was to serve her husband, and that she could perform other observances or under take fasts and pilgrimages only with her husband&rsquo;s permission. Vide Hemādri (Vrata-khaħda, part i. p. 362 where several texts are quoted including Mārkandeyapurāṇa 16. 61 ).1348</p>

<p>cited below. 1319 The Sūtrakāra concludes that women are untruth&rsquo; ( Anusagana 19. 6); &lsquo;there is nothing more wicked than women, who are the edge of a razor, poison, snake and fire in one&rsquo; (Anuśāsana 38. 12 and 29 ); there may be at most one pativratā in hundreds of thousands of women (Anuśāsana 19. 93 ); women are really uncontrollable but remain within bounds as regards their husbands simply because other men do not woo them and because they are afraid of servants' (Anuśāsana 38. 16 ); vide also Anuśāsana chap. 38. 24-25, obap. 39. 6-7 ( women have the tricks of the demons Sambara, Namuci and others). The Rāmāyana is not behind the Great Epic in condemning women &lsquo;This is the character of women seen in the three worlds viz, they are renegades from Dharma, fickle, oruel and create estrangement&rsquo; ( Aranya kāṇda'350 45. 29-30). In an uncharitable mood Manu (IX. 14-15) gives to women the following obaracter &lsquo;they are lascivious, fickle-minded, devoid of love and come to dislike their husbands and resort to another man, whether handsome or ugly, simply because he is a man.&rsquo; &lsquo;It is the nature of women to tempt men; therefore the wise do not act beedlessly with young women, who are able to lead a man astray whether he be learned or not&rsquo; (Manu II. 213-214 = Anuśāsana 48. 37-38). Bșhat-Parāśara 851 ( Jivananda&rsquo;s Collection, part %, p. 121 ) says that the passion of women is eightfold of that of men. In modern times old men, though they might not know much of the sāstras, are often in the habit of repeating a verse which contains a list of the faults of women &lsquo;falsehood, thoughtless aotion, trickery, folly, great greed, impurity, cruelty these are the natural faults of women. &ldquo;1858</p>

<p>Defence of Women</p>

<p>protested against the injustice of these accusations. Varaha mihira (6th century A. D.) in bis Bphat-Samhita chap. 74 ( ed. by Kern) makes a spirited defence of women and eulogises them highly. He first says that on women depend dharma and artha and from them man derives the pleasures of sense and the blessing of sons, that they are the Lakṣmi (goddess of Prosperity ) of the house and should be always given honour and wealth. He then condemns those who following the path of asceticism and other-worldliness proclaim the demerits of women and are silent about their virtues and pertinently asks 1358 &lsquo;tell me truly, what faults attributed to women have not been also practised by men? Men in their audacity treat women with contempt, but they really possess more virtues (than men). He then cites the dicta of Manu in support (verses 7-10). &ldquo;One&rsquo;s mother or one&rsquo;s wife is a woman; men owe their birth to women; O ungrateful wretches, how oan happiness be your lot when you condemn them? The bāstras declare that both husband and wife are equally sinful if they prove faithless to the marriage vow; men care very little for that sāstra ( while women do care ); therefore women are superior to men. Oh! how great is the audacity of wicked men who heap abuse on women that are pure and blameless, like robbers who while themselves stealing raise a hue and cry * atop, O thief I.&rsquo; Man in privacy utters words of cajolry to woman, but, there are no such words after the woman dies ; while women, in gratitudo, clasp the corpses of their husbands and enter the fire.&rdquo; It may be said that, barring great poets like Kalidāsa, 1864 Bana and Bhavabhūti, in the olassical period</p>

<p>Varahamihira&rsquo;s was rather a solitary voice raised in defence of women and in the appreciation of their worth.</p>
<p>In the midst of this dark picture and undeserved condem nation of woman there is one very bright spot, viz. the high eulogy of and the reverence for the mother in all smrti works. Gaut. (II. 56) first says that the acārya (one&rsquo;s teacher of the Veda) is the highest among gurus, while some teachers hold that the mother is the highest. The Ap. Dh, S. I. 10. 28. 9 prescribes that &amp; son must always serve his mother even if she has been an outcast ( for some great sin), since the mother undertakes for her son numerous ( troublesome) actions. Baud. Dh, S. (IL. 2. 48 ) requires the son to maintain his mother, even though an outcast, without speaking to her. Vas. Dh. S. 13. 47 says&rsquo;a father who is an outcast may be abandoned, but &amp; mother (though patita ) is never an outoast to the son. &ldquo;1365 &ldquo;The ācārya exceeds by his greatness ten upādbyāyas, the father exceeds a hundred ācāryas, a mother exceeds a thousand fathers&rsquo; says Manu II. 145 ( = Vas, Dh. $. 13.48 ). Saṅkha-Likhita1356 give a very salutary piece of advice &lsquo;the son should not take sides ( in a quarrel) between his father and mother : indeed he may (if he chooses ) epeak on the side of the mother alone, since the mother bore him ( in her womb ) and nourished him; the son, wbile living, would never be free from the debt he owes to his mother except by the performance of the Sautrāmaṇi saorifice.&rsquo; Yāj. I. 35 holds that the mother is superior to the guru, ācārya and upādhyāya, The Anuśāsana parya 1357 ( 105. 14-16 ) says that &lsquo;the mother excels in her greatness ten fathers or even the whole earth; there is no guru like the mother.&rsquo; Santiparva chap. 267 contains &amp; very high eulogy of the mother.

<p>Estimate about Women</p>
<p>581</p>
<p>Pandava heroes pay the highest honour to their mother Kunti. The Adiparya chap. 37 says that one may avert the conse quences of all curses, but a mother&rsquo;s curse can never be averted 1858.</p>
<p>Reading all that has been said in favour of and against women in ancient Sanskrit Literature it may be said that the higher minds of Hindu Society were quite aware of the worth of women, that they insisted on chastity as the bigbest virtue for them, that there was no doubt an underourrent among common people of poor opinion about women, that those who valued an ascetic life and wanted to wean people away from worldly ties and attachments looked down upon women (vairāgyamārgena&rsquo; as Varāhamibira happily puts it) and exaggerated their faults. It has to be borne in mind that many of the passages condemning women are put in the mouth of persons who were for some reason or other angry with women or wronged by them or dissatisfied with their conduct. Further in assessing passages disparaging the character of women one maxim of the Pūryamimāmsā system must not be lost sight of. The maxim is stated by Sabara ( on Jaimini II. 4. 21 ) as follows : 1359 the purpoge of a text censur ing anything is not censure pure and simple, but the purpose is to enjoin the performance of the opposite of what is censured and to praise such performance&rsquo;. The objeot therefore of the authors that censured women was to inculcate the great value of chastity and obedience for women and not merely to paint a dark picture of them.</p>
<p>The rights of women as regards partition and inheritance will be discussed in detail later on. But a brief statement about them may be made here. Ap., Manu, and Nārada do not allow the widow of a sonless male to succeed as heir, while Gaut. 28. 19 appears to contemplate that she is an heir along with sapindas or sagotras. That the widow&rsquo;s right to succeed as heir to her deceased husband was not recog oised in ancient</p>

<p>times is clear from the Sakuntala ( Aot VI) where the minister writes to the king that the estate of &amp; merchant dying at sea will escheat to the crown and will not go to his widow. Y&amp;j. II. 135. mentions the widow as the first heir of a sonless man dying separate; Vispu, Katyāyana and others say the same. So in medieval times the rights of widows to property were better recognized than in the times of the early gūtra writers. In this respect the position of women improved in medieval times, though in the religious and other spheres their position became worse, as they were equated with sūdras. Yaska while explaining Rg. I 124. states that in the southern countries the widow of a sonless man goes to an assembly ball, standa upon a stool and when the members strike her with dice she gets the property of her deceased 1380 husband. This implies that in Nothern India widows did not succeed to their husband&rsquo;s property in Yaska&rsquo;s time.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XII</p>
<p>THE DUTIES OF A WIDOW, SOME PRIVILEGES</p>
<p>OF WOMEN AND THE PURDA SYSTEM</p>
<p>Vidhavādharmaḥ So far the social position and the duties and rights of a wife during her husband&rsquo;s life-time have been considered. We shall now consider the rules laid down for a wife if she has the heavy misfortune to become a widow. 1361</p>
<p>The word vidhavā occurs several times in the Rgveda (.8. IV. 18. 12, X. 18.7, X. 40.2 and 8); but these passages contain very little that is indicative of their condition in society except Rs. X. 40.2 (vide under niyoga). Rg. I. 87, 3 1364 says in the rapid movements of the Maruts the earth trembles like a woman deprived of her husband,&rsquo; That shows that widows trembled either from sorrow or from fear of molestation and ill-treatment.</p>
<p>The Baud. Dh, S. 1363 II. 2. 66-68 prescribes that the widow of the departed should give up for one year honey, meat, wine and salt and should sleep on the ground; according to Maud. galya (she should so act) for six months; after that period, if she is Bonless, she may procreate &amp; son from her brother in-law if the elders consent.' Vas. Dh. 8. (17. 55-56 ) contains similar provisions. Manu (V. 157-160 ) contains rules that have been repeated in almost all smrtis &lsquo;a woman when her husband is dead, may, if she chooses, emaciate her body by subsisting on flowers, roots and fruits, but she should not even take the name of a stranger male. Till her death she should be forbearing, observe vows, should be celibate and should hanker after that super-eminent code of conduct that is presoribed for women devoted to their husbands. On her husband&rsquo;s death, if a virtuous woman abides by the rule of celibaoy, she goes to heaven though she be sonless, as the ancient perpetual</p>

<p>students (like Sanaka ) did. Kātyāyana 1364 similarly provides ' a gonless widow preserving the bed of her husband ( unsullied ) and residing with her elders and being self-controlled (or forbearing ) should enjoy her husband&rsquo;s property till her death; after her the heirs of her husband would get it. A widow engrossed in religious observances and fasts, abiding by the vow of celibacy, always bent on restraining her senses and making gifts would go to heaven oven though sonless,' Parāsara IV. 31 is almost the same as Manu V. 160. Brhaspati 1365 says *the wife is declared to be half of a man&rsquo;s body, she participates equally in the husband&rsquo;s merit and sin; &amp; virtuous wife, whether she burns herself on her husband&rsquo;s funeral fire or lives after bim, tends to the spiritual) benefit of her husband'. Výddha-Hārlta (XI. 205-210) prescribes what a widow should do all her life, &lsquo;She should give up adorning her hair, chewing betel-nut, wearing perfumes, flowers, ornaments and dyed olothes, taking food from a vessel of bronze, taking two meals a day, applying collyrium to her eyes; she should wear a white garment, should curb her senses and anger, she should not resort to deceits and tricks, should be free from laziness and sleep, should be pure and of good conduct, should always worship Hari, should sleep on the ground at night on a mat of kusa grass, she should be intent on concentration of mind and on the company of the good.&rsquo; Bāṇa in his Harṣacarita ( VI, last para ) indicates that widows did not apply eye-galve to their eyes nor rocana (yellow pigment) to their face and simply tied their hair.1386 Pracetas 1367 forbids to an ascetic and a widow the chewing of betel leaves, ceremonial bath (with oil &amp;c.) and taking meal in a vessel of bell-metal. The Adiparva (160, 12) says just as birds flock to a piece of flesh left on the ground, so all men woo (or try to seduce ) a woman whose</p>

<p>The Duties of a widow</p>
<p>585</p>
<p>husband is dead': while the Santiparva (148. ) remarks &lsquo;all widows are in sorrow even if they have many sons. 1368 The Skandapurana (Kasikhanda, chap. 4, vv. 71-106 and III Brahmaranya section ohap. 7, vv. 67-81) has long passages on the duties of widows, many verses from which ara quoted in the Madanaparijata (pp. 202-203), the Nirnayasindhu, Dharma sindhu and other nibandbas. A few striking verses may be translated here. The Skandapurāṇa (III, Brahmaranya seotion chap. 7, verses 50-51) says &lsquo;The widow is more inauspicious than all other inauspicious things; at the sight of a widow no success oan be had in any undertaking ; excepting one&rsquo;s ( widowed) mother all widows are void of auspiciousness%3 &amp; wise man should avoid even their blessings like the poison of a snake 1809. The Kāśikhanda of the game purāṇa, chap. 4, delivers itself thus the tying up into a braid of the hair by the widow leads to the bondage of the husband; therefore a widow should always abave her head. She should always take one meal a day and never &amp; second; or she may perform the observance of fast for a month or undergo the penance of cāndrā yaṇa. A widow who sleeps on &amp; cot would make her husband fall (in hell). A widow should never wash her body with fragrant unguents nor should enjoy the fragrance of sweet smelling things; she should everyday perform tarpana with sesame, water and kusa grass for her husband, his father and grandfather after repeating their names and gotra; she should not sit in &amp; bullock cart even when about to die, she should not put on a bodice, should not wear dyed garments and should observe special vows in Vaisakha, Kartikaro and Magha.&rsquo;.

<p>Kāśikhanda 4.74) is the only verse on wbich the medieval writers rely for prescribing continual tonsure of widows. That ohapter begins by extolling the pativratā ( Bphaspati does it with regard to Lopamudrā, the wife of Agastya). It passes one&rsquo;s under standing why when a pativratā whose husband is living is before Bphaspati he should wax eloquent over the duties of widows ( verses 71-106 ). Therefore this portion appears to be an interpolation in the Skandapurāṇa itself. In Lakshmibai v. Ramchandra I. L. R. 22 Bom. 590, it was held that the text &lsquo;vidhara-kabarl-bandho&rsquo; is of doubtful validity (p. 594 ). Besides 69 verses of this chapter 4 are common to chap. 7 of the Dharmāranya section of the Skandapurāṇa ( III ) which precedes it. There is no reason why they should have been repeated. The Nirnayasindhu quotes &amp; passage from the Brabmapurāṇa as cited in the Pșthvioandrodaya to the effeot that sraddha food should not be got prepared by a widow belonging to another gotra.!??</p>
<p>The position of the Hindu widow was miserable and her lot was most unenviable. She was looked upon as inauspicious and so could take part in no festivities, such as those on marriage. She had not only to lead a life of perfeot celibacy, even if she was a child widow, but she had to act like an ascetic, being poorly fed (only once a day) and poorly olad. Her rights to property were negligible. Even if the husband died sonless she did not originally succeed as shown above (p. 582). Later on her position as an beir was improved; but even then she could ordinarily enjoy only the income of the pro perty and could transfer it only for the legal necessities of the family ( including herself) or for the spiritual benefit of her husband. In a joint Hindu family a widow had only the right of maintenance ( except in Bongal where she had more rights ), which would be forfeited if she became unohaste and persisted in that course. 1378 If she returned to a moral life then she may be entitled to bare starving maintenance (vide above p. 573 ). If her husband had separate property and left a son or sons, the widow was only entitled to maintenance. This was the law</p>

<p>The Duties of a widow</p>
<p>587</p>
<p>widow of a member in a joint Hindu family and of the widow of a person who leaves separate property has been improved by Act XVIII of 1937 as amended by Act XI of 1938.</p>
<p>One subject that arouses bitter controversies is the practice of tonsuring widows among brāhmaṇas and certain other castes. A few words must be said on this. It is clear from the verso (vidhavā-kabari.bandho &amp;c.) of the Skandapurāṇa quoted in the Madanapārijāta and other nibandhas that for some time at least before the 14th century A. D. (when the Madanapārijāta was composed) tonsure of widows was in yogue. How and exactly when this practice arose cannot be established with certainty. That it is comparatively &amp; later innovation can, however, be demonstrated. Two distinct propositions have to be made out, first, that widows were tonsured on the death of their husbands, just as sons were tonsured and secondly, that widows were required by the texts to tonsure themselves continually from time to time till their death, though sons who had to tonsure themselves on their father&rsquo;s death are not required to do so after wards. Tbe advocates of this practice rely upon three Vedio passages, viz. Rg. X. 40.2, Ap. M. Pātha I. 4. 9, and Atharvaveda 14.2. 60, Rg. X. 40, 2 ( cited below p. 606 ) refers to vidhavā only and probably to niyoga, but there is nothing about tonsure in that Verse. Some modern orthodox Pandita ingeniously argue from the explanation of the word &lsquo;vidhava&rsquo; in the Nirukta (IIL 15 vidh.. vanād-vā iti Carmaśirāḥ). Carmaśiras is the name of a former teacher according to all commentators of the Nirukte, but these pandits interpret it by a tour de force as &amp; synonym of vidhavi (&lsquo;having only the bare skin on her head&rsquo;). About this interpretation the less said the better. Ap.M.P. 1.5.9 contains the word &lsquo;vikesil which is translated as the appellation of a female goblin in S. B. E. vol. 30 p. 187 &lsquo;mayst thou not be beaten at thy breast by she goblin, the rough haired 1378 one&rsquo;. Even taking &lsquo;vikesi As referring to the maiden who is being married the meaning is &lsquo;mayst thou, with dishevelled hair, not beat thy breast ( through grief )&rsquo;. The word &lsquo;vikesi&rsquo; does not mean &lsquo;a widow whose hair is tonsured&rsquo;; it ordinarily means&rsquo; &amp; woman</p>

<p>with dishevelled hair&rsquo;. The third passage is Atharvaveda 1376 14. 2. 60, that is a verse in a marriage hymn which means ' if this daugbter of thine has bewailed with loosened hair in thy house, doing evil by her wailing, from that sin let Agni and Savitr release thes'. Here it is impossible to hold that' vikesi' means tonsured, as this mantra is part of the marriage hymn and Agni is asked to remove the blemish due to the girl&rsquo;s weeping at the approaching prospect of separation from her parents. There is no comment of Sāyaṇa on this passage but elsewhere in the Atharvaveda when that word oocurs as in Atharva XI. 9. 14 he paraphrases it by &lsquo;vikirṇakesi&rsquo; which does not mean &lsquo;with tonsured hair&rsquo; but only &lsquo;baving dishevelled hair&rsquo;. Therefore there is no reference whatever to the tonsure of widows in the Veda, much less an inju notion as to it. In the Baud. Pitṛmedhasūtra, 1375 elaborate rules are laid down about the cremation of one who had kindled the sacred Vedic fires. In I. 4. 3 it is said his wives led by the youngest should follow the cortege with dishevelled hair and throwing dust on their shoulders' and this they have to repeat several times ( vide I. 4. 12-13, 1. 5, 5-7, I. 5. 12-14) on the way to the cemetery. It is also said that they go round the corpse) thrice with their hair gathered togetber (I. 4. 13). Then in I. 12. 7 shaving of the hair and moustache is prescribed for the close relatives of the deceased ( amātyas ) who are present, his wives are not mentioned in this connection and II. 3. 17 expressly forbids tonsure of wives.</p>
<p>Manu and Yāj, dilate on the duties of widowe, but they are entirely silent about tonsure. Nor does any other ancient smrti refer to it. On the contrary Vśddha-Hārita (XI. 206 quoted above p. 584 ) asks the widow not to deck her hair, among other things which, she is not to do. This makes it clear that the widows kept their hair. The word &lsquo;keśarañjanam&rsquo; is to be dissolved as &lsquo;kesanām rañjanam&rsquo; and not as &lsquo;kesasoa rañjanam 08&rsquo; ( as Vžddha-Harita XI. 103 makes it clear by employing &lsquo;kegānāṁ raśjanartham vā). It can be shown that</p>

<p>The tonsure of widows</p>
<p>589</p>
<p>at least kṣatriya widows never tonsured their head. In the Mahābhārata whenever the widows of the fallen warriors are described they are always referred to as &lsquo;having dishevelled hair&rsquo; and there is not a single reference to tonsure 1378 of widows. In the Harṣacarita, Harga 1377 in his soliloquy on the death of his father Prabhākaravardhana says &lsquo;may the Glory of super-eminent man-hood tie up her hair in the way in :which widows tie up their hair&rsquo;. In the Pehoa praśasti of king Mahendrapala of Kanoj (E. I. vol. 1. p. 246 verse 16) the widows of his enemies are spoken of as shedding tears on their cheeks and having long ( not braided) and profuse 1378 tresses.</p>
<p>The orthodox pandits rely on a verse in Vedavyasa-smṛti 1379 II. 53 &lsquo;a brāhmaṇa woman should enter fire, clasping the dead body of her husband; if she lives ( does not become sali ) she being tyaktakesā should emaciate her body by tapas&rsquo;. The read. ing brāhmaṇi&rsquo; for &lsquo;jivanti&rsquo; is not good, as the word &lsquo;brāhmaṇl&rsquo; is redundant having occurred in the first half and as the second half refers to the faot of her surviving after her husband. In this verse the injunction relates only to the emaciation of the body ( śoṣayet ), the word &lsquo;tyaktakeśa&rsquo; being only an attribute of the subject is no part of the predicate, which alone is enjoined. The general rule laid down by the Mimāṁsā is (III. 1. 13-15, the grahaikatvanyāya) | 380 that the attributes of a subject are no part</p>

(1) one who has given up or is unmindful of dressing or decking her hair, (2) one whose hair is given up in accordance with the prescription of some smṛtis that only two finger-breadths of tresses are to be cut off when doing penance for govadba &amp;c. in the case of women (vide Parāśara IX. 54-55, Angiras 163, Yama 54 ); (3) one whose head is tonsured. For the first meaning vide Raghuvamāa IX. 14 ( where &lsquo;analakām&rsquo; is explained by Mallinātha as&rsquo; who have given up ornamenting the hair'). For this meaning of &lsquo;tyakta&rsquo; vide Bhagavadgitā I. 33' tyaktajivitāḥ'. &lsquo;Tyakta ' by itself never means tonsured. The third meaning will be only implied if at all, while the first two are the usual meanings. Further, the interpretation of the Veda-Vyāsa smrti II. 53 given by the pandits is liable to the fault called vākyabheda (i. 8. it lays down two injunctions in one and the same sentence ), as they say that Veda-Vyasa calls upon widows to tongure themselves and to emaciate their body. Besides, if Veda-Vyasa really meant to enjoin tonsure, the verge could easily have been made to read &lsquo;jivanti ced vapet kesān tapasā &amp;o.&rsquo; Lastly assuming that Veda-Vyāga refers to tonsure, there is conflict among smptis, since Vrddha-Harita ( quoted above ) allows her to keep her hair, and since an option results when two texts of equal authority conflict ( Gaut. I. 5). 1381</p>
<p>The Mit. on Yāj. III. 325 quotes a text of Manu (not found in the printed Manu) shaving of the hair is not desired in the case of learned men, the king and women, except in the case of one guilty of mahāpātaks or the killer of a cow and a brahma. carl guilty of sexual intercourse. 1889 The Mit. nowhere refers to tonsure as one of the obligatory matters for widows.</p>
<p>The orthodox pandits further rely upon Ap. Dh. 8. I. 3.10.6, its explanation in the Mit. on Yāj. III. 17 and the explanation of the Mit, in the commentary, Balambhatti.

<p>case of the death of these he must also bathe for the same number of days. Persons who are younger than (the relation deceased) must shave their hair. 1383 Some declare that students who have returned home on completion of brahmacarya sball never shave except when engaged in a frauta sacrifice. In sattras even the top-lock must be shaved&rsquo;. In this there is no reference to women, much less to widows and lesser still to the tonsure of widows. The reference to srauta sacrifices, sattra, and-sikha indicates that only males are in view. The Mit. on Yāj. III. 17 explains at length Ap. Dh, S. I. 3. 10. 6. It gives two Benses of &lsquo;anubhavin&rsquo; viz. those who experience sorrow on the death of a person i. e. his gapiṇdas ( from the root &lsquo;bhủ&rsquo; with &lsquo;anu,&rsquo; to experience) and those who are born after the deceased i. e. who are younger than the deceased (from &lsquo;bhu&rsquo; with &lsquo;anu &lsquo;to be born after). The Mit. then combines 1384 these and remarks &lsquo;those sapindas of the deceased who are younger than the latter have to save themselves on the death of a relative&rsquo;. This is its own view. It then refers to the view of some that &lsquo;anubhāvin&rsquo; In Ap. means &lsquo;son&rsquo; and those latter rely on a restrictive text * shaving is declared on seven occasions only, vix. on the Ganges, in the Bhaskara-kṣetra, on the death of one&rsquo;s parents or teacher, at the time of consecrating srauta fires, and at the time of a soma sacrifice&rsquo;. It is clear that the Mit. does not expressly mention the wife or widow here. Supposing that she is impliedly referred to as &amp; sapiṇda and as younger than her husband, this will at the most come to the requirement that on the death of the husband the wife had to undergo shaving, just as her son would have to do. But this passage cannot be used to support continual shaving of widows throughout life. Really &lsquo;anubhāvinām&rsquo; in Ap. cannot include the wife; since if women were to be included by the rule of ekaśega ( vide Panini I. 2. 67 ) the absurd conclusion would follow that the daughters of the deceased and his younger brother&rsquo;s wives (who are all sapiṇdas and younger) would have</p>

<p>to be shaved. The Nirnayasindhu 1388 ( composed in 1612 A. D.) and the Bālambhatti ( composed towards the end of the 18th century ) were both familiar with the tonsure of widows and so they interpret Ap. and the Mit. as requiring shaving for the wife on the 10th day after the death of the husband and rely on a text of Vyāsa quoted in Aparārka. The Balambhatti says &ldquo;the words on the death of the mother and father&rsquo; are only illustra tive and so the same rule applies to the husband&rsquo;s death.&rdquo; Even conceding all this far-fetched interpretation, there is no authority for the continual tonsure of widows tbronghout their lives in these passages. It may be noted that the Madana pārijāta 1386 which contains the verse (vidbavā-kabarl-bandho &amp;o. quoted above ) does not include the widow among &lsquo;anubha vinām&rsquo;, but only male sapiṇdas and sons.</p>
<p>The foregoing discussion leads to the following conclusions. There is no express Vedio authority for the tonsure of widows. The grhya or dharma sūtras do not refer to it; nor do important smstis like those of Manu and Yāj. If one or two smrti verses of doubtful import seem to refer to it, other smrtis. Like Vžddha-Harita are to an opposite effect. Some of the smrti texts only refer, if at all, to one shaving on the husband&rsquo;s death, but there is no smrti passage prescribing continual shaving for widows. There is only the Skandapurāṇa passage expressly requiring tonsure of widows. The Mit. and Aparārks are silent about it. It appears that the practice Was gradually evolved after the 10th or 11th century. As widows were equated with yatis for several injunctions ( vide note 1367 above ) and as the latter shaved themselves, widows were gradually required to do so. By rendering them ugly it might have been intended to keep them ohaste. Probably the example of Buddhist and Jaina nuns may have also suggested the cruel practice. We find from the Oullavagga 1387 that Buddhist nuns</p>

<p>cut off their hair and put on orange-coloured robes. In Maha rāṣtra brāhmaṇa widows a few years ago wore a garment that wag reddish ( and even now a few old widows do wear it). At all events the practice is not very old and hardly any digest before the Madanapārijāta ( 14th century ) quotes the Skanda. purāna text. The practice is dying out and deserves to be suppressed at once, though strange insistence on it sometimes obtains publio notoriety. Recently the worshippers in the famous shrine of Vithobā at Pandharpur in Mahārāṣtra pre yented an untonsured brāhmaṇa widow from baving darśana of the idol in the customary way i. e, by placing the head on the feet of the idol, while they were prepared to allow untongured widows of all castes ( except the so called untouchables ), and even Hindu prostitutes in the keeping of Christians or Maho medans to have darśana in that way. The matter came before a civil court, where it was decided in favour of the widow that no such disorimination could be allowed to pravail, but owing to certain unforeseen circumstances the case did not come before the Bombay High Court,</p>
<p>It would be of interest to many to learn that among one sect ( the Tengalai) of the Sri-vaiṣnavas ( followers of Rāmā. nuja ) tonsure of widows has been forbidden for centuries, though tbat sect is most orthodox in other matters. 1388 The Śūdrakamalakara romarks that widows in Gouda keep their hair. 1989</p>
<p>From very ancient times, it appears the idea was that women should not be killed on any account. The Sat. Br. ( XI. 4. 3. 2, S. B. E. vol. 44, p. 62 ) says 1390 people do not kill a woman, but rather take (anything ) from her (leaving her ) alive&rsquo;. It was only the king who was authorised, according to Visvarūpa, to punish a woman to death for adultery with a inan of very low caste ( vide Gaut, and Manu VIII. 371 quoted above on p. 572 ), but the king had to undergo a slight penance for doing this ( vide Yāj. III, 268). Manu XI. 190 ordains that one who killed a woman was not to be associated with, even after he performed the requisite ponance. Manu IX. 232 calls</p>

<p>upon the king to punish with death those who murder women, children and brahmaṇas. The Mahabhārata frequently refers to this chivalrous rule. Adiparva 1391 158. 31 says &lsquo;those who know dharma declare that women are not to be killed&rsquo;. The Sabhāparya 41. 13 prescribes &lsquo;one&rsquo;s weapons should not be directed against women, cows, brāhmaṇas, against one who gave livelihood or shelter&rsquo;. In the Santiparva (135. 14 ) even thieves are instructed not to kill women. Vide also Ādi. 153, 2, 217. 4, Vanaparva 206. 46. The Rāmāyaṇa ( Balakānda ) also breathes this sentiment, when Rāma was called upon to kill the ogress Tataka.</p>
<p>Even for the most serious offence of adultery with a man of a low caste Yaj. II. 286 prescribes for the woman the punish ment of cutting the ear &amp;c. Similarly Vṛddha-Hārsta VII. 192</p>
<p>prescribes the cutting of the nose, ear and lip for attempt to &lsquo;murder the husband or her foetus. Vide Yaj. II. 278-279 for the sentence of death in the case of women for certain offences.</p>
<p>It has been seen how women gradually lost the privilege of upanayana, of studyiog the Veda, of having all the samskāras performed with Vedic mantras and how they came to be regarded as entirely dependent on men. Their position became assimilated to that of the sūdras 1392 in many matters. A few examples will be cited here. All dvijātis were to sip water thrice (acamana) for purifying their body, but women and sūdras were to sip water only once for that purpose ( Manu V. 139, Yāj. I. 21). The dvijātis were 1393 to take their bath to the accompaniment of Vedio mantras, while women and sūdras were to bathe silently. Sūdras and women were to perform what is called amaśrāddba (i. e. śrāddba without cooked food).1394 The same penance was prescribed for killing a sūdra or a woman ( Baud. Dh. 8. II. 1. 11-12, Parāśara VI. 16). Ordinarily women, children and very old men could not be witnesses ( Yaj.</p>

<p>II. 70, Nārada, rnādāna, vv. 178, 190, 191 ), but Manu VIII. 68, 70, Yāj. II. 72, and Nārada, rṇādāna 155 allowed women to be witnesses in disputes between women or when no other witness could be had or in the cases of theft, adultery and other offences in which force was an element. Documents taken from or transactions ( partioularly gift, sale and mortgage of lands or houses ) made with women were ordinarily to be treated as voidable like those brought about by force or fraud (vide Nārada, ļṇādana 26, 137, Yāj, II. 31). But this instead of being regarded as a disability was rather a boon owing to the general illiteracy of women. The Tristhalssetu (of Nārāyana ) quotes a passage of the Brhan-Nāradiya purāṇa to the effect that women, those whose upanayana has not been performed and sūdras bave no right to establish the images of Viṣṇu or Śiva. 1395</p>
<p>If there were many and heavy disabilities on women in certain matters, they enjoyed in certain directions more privi. leges than men. It has been already seen that women were not to be killed nor were they to be abandoned even when guilty of adultery. They also enjoyed the right of precedence on the road (vide p. 146 above). The daughter 1386 of a patita was not regarded as palita, though the son of a patita was regarded as patita ( vide Vas. 13. 51-53, Ap. Dh. S. II. 6. 13, 4, Yaj. III. 261). Women 1887 had to undergo only half of the prāyascitta that men had to undergo for the same lapse (Visṇu Dh. 8. 54. 33, Devala 30, &amp;o). Women received 1398 honour according to the ages of their husbands, whatever their own ages may be (Ap. Dh. S. I. 4. 14. 18). Just as brābmaṇas learned in the Vedas were to be free from taxes, the women of all varnas (except those of pratiloma castes ) had to pay no taxes, 1999 according to Āp. Dh.</p>

<p>S. II. 10. 26. 10-11). Vas. D5, S. 19. 23 limits this exemption to women who are young or just delivered of a child. Pregnant women from the third month of pregnancy, forest hermits, samnyāsins and brahmaṇas and brahmacārins had to pay no tax at a ferry (Manu VIII. 407 and Visnu V. 132 ). According to Gaut. V, 23 and Yāj. 1. 105 children, the daughters and sisters who are married and yet stay with their parents or brothers, pregnant women, unmarried daughters, guests and servants are to be fed before the master and mistress of the house; wbile Manu III. 114 and Viṣṇu Dh, S. 67. 39 go a step further and say that freshly married girls of the fanily, unmarried girls, pregnant women are to be fed even before guests. A judicial proceeding in which a woman was a party, or which was heard at night or outside the village or inside a house (i. e. not in public) or before enoinies was liable to be reviewed (Nārada 1:00 I. 43). Ordinarily trial by ordeal did not apply to a woman, whether she was plaintiff or defendant, but if at all a woman had to prove her case by ordeal, only the ordeal of tulā ( balance ) was prescribed for her (Yaj. 11, 98 and Mit. thereon ). In succession to strīdhana property, daughters were preferred to sons. Women did not lose their stridhana by adverse possossion ( Yāj. II. 25, Nārada, ṣṇādāna 82-83). Women were always to be consulted about ācāra, Ap. Dh, S, II. 11. 29. 15 cites the view that rules not stated in the sūtra are, according to some teachers, to be understood from women and from men of all castes. Āp. gr. II. 15 prescribes that in marriage the usages to be followed are to be learnt from women. Vide also Asv. gr. I. 14. 8, Manu II. 223, Vaik, III. 21. 1401</p>
<p>One interesting question is whether the practice of purda now in vogue among Moslems and also among Hindus in certain provinces of India prevailed in anoient times. Rg. X, 85, 33 (used in the marriage rite) expressly calls upon people to look at the bride. &ldquo;This bride is endowed with great auspicious ness; assemble together and see her; having given her bless ings of good luck you may go to your house&rsquo;. The Asv. gr. I. 8. 7 prescribes that at each halting place when the bride-groom is returning to his village with his bride he should</p>

<p>look at the spectators with the verge Rg. X. 85. 33. 1408 This shows that no veil was worn by the bride and she appeared in public without one. Though in the marriage hymn there is a blessing (Rg. X. 85.46) that the bride was to dominate over her father-in-law, mother-in-law, sister-in-law and brother-in-law, it appears that that was only a blessing and the heart&rsquo;s wish, but the reality was somewhat different. The Ait. Br. 1408 (12. 11) gays that the daughter-in-law is abashed in the presence of the father-in-law and goes away concealing herself from him. This indicates that there was some restraint for younger women when they were in the presence of elders. But in the gļhya and dharma sūtras there is no reference to any veil for women when moving in public. Pāṇini III. 2. 36 teaches the formation of &lsquo;asūryampaśyā&rsquo; (who do not see the sun) applied to queens. That only shows that royal ladies did not leave the precincts of the palace and come under publio gaze. In the Ayodhya-kāṇda 1404 ( 33. 8) it is said ' people walking on the publio road see to-day Sitā who could not formerly be seen even by aerial beings'. Similarly it is stated in the same kāṇda ( 116.28) &lsquo;the appearance of a woman in publio is not blamable in misfortunes, diffioulties, in wars, in svayamvara, in &amp; sacrifice, and in a marriage&rsquo;. In the Sabhāparva 1405 69.9 Draupadi exolaims &lsquo;we have heard that ancient people did not take married women to the public assembly-hall; that ancient and long-standing practice has been contravened by the Kauravas&rsquo; She says this after referring to the fact that, since she was seen at her svayamvara by the kings, she was never seen again by them till the day she</p>

<p>was brought to the assembly-hall when Yudhisthira gambled and lost everything. This shows that women, particularly high born ladies, did not appear in public except on certain occasions, but it does not follow that they always wore the veil. When the Kauravas were routed the Salyaparva ( 29.74 ) laments that their ladies whom even the sun did not see in their palaces were seen by the common people who had come to the capital. Vide also Sabhāparva 97. 4-7, Salyaparva 19. 63, StrIparva 9. 9-10, Aśrama-vāsi-parva 15. 13. In the Harṣacarita (IV) princess Rājyasri, whom the intended bride-groom Grahavarmā came to see just before marriage, is described as having her face covered with a veil of fine red cloth. In another place, while describing the country of Sthāṇvisvara ( modern Thanesar) Bāṇa says &ldquo;where bees drawn by the fragrance of the breaths of the ladies (and hovering round their faces ) served as a charming veil for their faces and the veil actually worn by them became a mere redundancy worn because it was the practice of high-born ladies to wear one'. In the Kādambari also (para 99 ) Bāṇa describes Patralekha as covering her face with a veil of red cloth. In the sakuntala 1406 when Sakuntalā is taken to the court of Duṣyanta she is described as wearing &amp; veil. So it must be conceded that ladies of high rank did not appear in public without a veil, but ordinarily women did not wear any veil. It is probably after the advent of the Moslems that the wearing of a veil, which was not quite unknown, became general among Hindu women in Northern and Eastern India. Vide Indian Antiquary for 1933 p. 15, where &amp; passage is quoted from the Saṅkhyatattva-kaumudi of Vacaspati ( 9th century A. D.) referring to ladies of good family not appearing in public without a veil and Pathak Commemoration vol. p. 72 for references from Buddhist works about the practice of purda.</p>

<p>son from intercourse with an appointed male ). Great divergence of views prevails about the origin and purpose of this practice. It will be best first to begin by examining the most ancient smṛtis that permitted this practice. Gaut. 1407 18. 4-14 have great bearing on this point, Gaut. 18. 4-8 are: &lsquo;&amp; woman whose husband is dead and who desires offspring may socure &amp; son from her brother-in-law. She should obtain the permission of the elders 1308 and have intercourse only during the menstrual period (exoluding the first four days). She may obtain a son from a sapiṇda, &amp; sagotra, &amp; sapravara or one who belongs to the same caste (when there is no brother-in-law). Some (hold that this practice is allowed) with nobody except a brother-in-law. She shall not bear more than two sons (by this practice ). Gaut. 18. 11 says that a child begotten at the request of a living husband on his wife belongs to the husband. Gaut. (28. 32) says that such a son is called kṣetraja. The wife is called kṣetra 1499 ( field ), the husband of the wife or widow is called kṣetrin or kṣetrika (to whom the wife or widow belongs) and the person appointed to produce offspring is called bijin (one who Bows the seed) or niyogin (Vas. 17. 64, one who is appointed).</p>

<p>The Vas. Dh. S. (17. 56-65) similarly presoribes 1410 * the father or brother of the widow (or widow&rsquo;s husband) shall assemble the gurus who taught or sacrificed for the deceased husband and his relatives and shall appoint her (to raise issue for the deceased husband ). Let him not appoint a widow who is mad, not master of herself (through grief &amp;c.) or is diseased or is very old. (Up to ) sixteen years ( after puberty is the period for appointing a widow ) nor shall an appointment be made if the person who is to approach her is siokly. Let him approach the widow in the muhurta sacred W1 to Prajapati like a husband, without dallying with her and without abusing or ill-treating her. No appointinent shall be made through &amp; desire to obtain 1419 the estate.&rsquo; Baud. Dh. S. II. 2. 17 (8. B. E. vol. 14, p. 226 ) defines a kṣelraja son as one who is begotten by another man after permission on the wife of a deceased person or of 8 eunuch or of one who is suffering from ( an incurable disease). Manu (IX. 59-61 ) says that a widow who is properly appointed may obtain offspring, in case there is total failure of issue, from her brother-in-law or &amp; sapinda of her husband, that the person appointed should approach her in the dark and should be anointed with ghee and should procroate only one son and never two, while some say that he may procreate two. Baud. Dh. . II. 2. 68-70, Yaj. I. 68-69 and Nārada ( strīpumsa, 80-83 ) lay down similar rules. Kautilya (I. 17, p. 35 ) says that &amp; king who is old or suffering from (incurable ) disease should procreate &amp; son on his queen through &amp; mātsbandhu or a feudatory chief endowed with qualities similar to his. In another place he says that if a brāhmana dies without leaving a near heir, then &amp; sagotra or mātsbandhu</p>

<p>may be appointed to procreate a kṣetraja son, who should get the inheritance.&ldquo;413 The conditions necessary to allow niyoga were : (1) the husband, whether living or dead, must have no son; (2) the gurus in &amp; family council should decide to appoint the widow to raise issue for the husband; (3) the person appointed must be either the busband&rsquo;s brother, or a sapiṇda or sagotra of the husband or (according to Gautama, a sapravara or a person of the same caste);(4) the person appointed and the widow must be actuated by no lust but only by a sense of duty; (5) the person appointed must be anointed with ghee or oil (Nārada, 1414 strīpumsa, 82), must not speak with or kiss her or engage in sportive dalliance with the woman; (6) this relationship was to last till one son was born (or two according to some); (7) the widow must be comparatively young, she should not be old or sterile or past child-bearing or sickly or unwilling or pregnant (Baud. Dh. S. 11. 2,70, Nārada, stripuīsa 83-84); (8) after the birth of a son they were to rogard themselves as father-in-law and daughter-in-law (Manu 1X. 62). It is further made clear by the texts that if a brother-in-law has intercourse with his sister-in-law without appointment by elders or if he does so even when appointed by elders but the other circumstances do not exist (e. g. if the husband has a son), he would be guilty of the sin of incest ( vide Menu IX. 58, 63, 143, 144 and Nārada, stripumsa 85-86 ) and a son, born of such interoourse, would be a bastard and not entitled to any wealth (Nārada, stripumsa 84-85 ) and that he would 1419 belong to the begetter ( Vas. Dh. S. 17. 63). Nārada says that if a widow or &amp; male acts contrary to the stringent provisions about niyoga, he or she should be severely punished by the king or ortherwise there would be confusion. Yāj. II. 234 makes such a person liable to be sentenced to a fine of one hundred paṇas. It will be seen from the above that even in the times of the Dharmasūtras, the practice of niyoga was hedged round with so many restric</p>

<p>tions that it must not have been very much prevalent and instances must have been rather rare.</p>
<p>While ancient Dharmasutras like Gautama allowed niyoga, there were other dharmasūtras and writers almost as old as Gautama that condemned the practice and forbade it. Ap. Dh. S.1418 II. 10. 27. 5-7 after referring to the view of some that a girl is given to a family in marriage and declaring that that practice (of polyandry ) is forbidden adds &amp; condemnation of niyoga&rsquo;the hand (of a sagotra is considered to be ) that of a stranger; that if (the marriage vow) is transgressed, both (husband and wife ) certainly go to hell and that the reward obtained from observing the restrictions of the law is preferable to offspring obtained in this manner (by niyoga).&rsquo; Baud. Dh. S. II. 2.38 refers!417 to the view of Aupajanghani that it is only the aurasa son that is to be recognized as &amp; son and then quotes three verses (probably of the same ancient sage ), which are also oited as quotations by Ap. Db, S. ( II. 6. 13. 6 ) and which call upon husbands to guard their wives and not allow others to procreate sons on the latter, as the sons so procreated will benefit only the begetter. Manu, though at first he desoribes niyoga, ultimately condemns it in the strongest terms possible (IX, 64-68). He says that among dvijātis a widow should never be appointed to raise issue from another, for by doing so ancient dharma would be violated, that in the mantras relating to marriage there is no reference to niyoga nor is the remarriage of a widow spoken of in the procedure about marriage, that niyoga is a beastly way and was first brought into vogue by king Vena who thereby caused varra-samkara, and that since that time good men condemn him who through ignorance appoints &amp; widow to produce offspring. Manu (IX. 69-70) explains the meaning of niyoga by saying that the rules and the ancient texts about niyoga apply or refer to that case only where, after a girl is promised as a bride, the intended bridegroom dies, the</p>

<p>brother of the latter is called upon to marry the girl and to have intercourse with her only once during each period till she gives birth to a son who would be the son of the deceased. Though Manu condemned the ancient practice of niyoga, he had to make provision for the kṣetraja son as regards partition (IX. 120-121, 145 ). It should be noticed that if the inter pretation of Manu IX, 69-70 be accepted, the word &lsquo;vidhayā&rsquo; would have to be taken in two different senses in Manu and other texts e. g. in IX. 60 where Manu speaks of niyoga, the word means &amp; girl promised to a bridegroom who died before the marriage ceremony was gone through, while in Manu IX. 64 vidhava&rsquo; means &lsquo;&amp; widow whose husband died after marriage was completed.&rsquo; To say the least, this contravenes the canon of Mimāṁsā interpretation that the same word in the same passage or context should have only one meaning. Bphaspati&quot;418 refers to the fact that the Manuemrti first des oribed the ancient niyoga and then forbade it and adds that in former ages men possessed tapas and knowledge and could strictly carry out the rules while in dvāpara and kali ages there is great deterioration of power and so men of these times cannot now practise niyoga. The several kinds of sops will be dealt with under vyavahūra.</p>
<p>The Viṣṇu Dh. S. (15,3) contains an innovation wbich is not found in the sūtras of Gautama and Vasiṣthe viz, the kṣetraja is one!19 who is procreated on an appointed wife or widow by a sapinda of the husband or by a brābmana,' The Mahābhārata is replete with cases of niyoga. Adiparva (95 and 103 ) narrates how Satyavati pressed Bhiṣma to procreate sons for bis younger brother Vicitravirya (who was dead) from his queens and how ( Adi, 105 ) when Bhiṣma refused Vyāsa ulti mately was appointed by Vyasa&rsquo;s mother Satyavati and pro created Dbptarāṣṭra and Pandu.

<p>the objector finding fault with Vyasa by saying that Vyāsa followed Gaut. (18.4-5) and the urgent request of his mother and besides bis tapas saved him from the effects of violation of dharma. Pandu himself is said to have asked Kunti to procreate sons for him by niyog&amp; from a brābmana endowed with great tapas ( Ādi, 120 ) and tells her certain stories of niyoga (Ādi. 120-123) and winds up by saying that three sons is 1431 the limit and that if a fourth or &amp; fifth were procreated the woman would be svairini (a wanton woman) and bandhaki (liarlot). Adiparva (chap. 64 and 104 ) states that when Parasurāına tried to exterminate the kṣatriyas thousands of kṣatriya widows approached brāhmaṇas for the procreation of sons. 1182 Vide Adiparva, chap, 104 and 177, Anuśāsana, chap. 44.52-53, Santi 72. 12 for other references and examples of niyogs. 1483</p>
<p>Owing to the bewildering and often conflicting rules about niyoga in the smrtis, commentators like Viśvarūpa, Medhātithi, who wrote at a time when niyoga was almost unheard of, made heroio though unsatisfactory efforts to bring order out of chaos. Viśvarūpa on Yāj. 1. 69 states several views on the point. The first is that niyoga is bad in the present age as opposed to smrti texts (like Manu IX, 64 and 68 ) and to the usage of the śiṣtas ( respectable people ). The second view was the same as Manu IX, 69 set out above. A third view was that there was an option (as niyoga was both forbidden and allowed ). A fourth view (which seems to be the view of Viśvarūpa himself) was that the smsti texts about niyoga refer to śūdras 148* ( Manu IX. 64 uses the word &lsquo;dvijāti&rsquo;) and it was also allowed to royal families, when there was no male to succeed ( and only a brāh maṇa was to be appointed) and Visvārūpā relies upon two</p>

<p>verses of Vṛddhamanu 1485 and a gātha of Vāyu. Visvarūpa further says that the procreation of sons by Vyasa from the queens of Vicitravirya should be paid no heed ( i. e. is not to be relied on) like the marriage of Draupadi ( to the five Pandavas), The Mahābhārata probably reflects what happened owing to the incessant internecine wars among the princes of India. Whole princely houses must have been slaughtered. If niyoga was prevalent among them, the males appointed, when they had to be of the same caste, would have been ordinary soldiers ( kṣatri yas). The proud princely families very likely thought it below their dignity to associate widowed queens with ordinary kṣatriyas. It is possible to hold that they chose brāhmaṇas for appointment, as the latter were deemed to be higher than even kings in the spiritual domain. It is impossible to believe that Brāhmaṇas, who had no temporal power, could coerce the proud and warlike oaste into choosing brāhmaṇas for niyoga, unless the teaching of the smṛtis fell in with the notions of the ruling houses themselves to some extent at least.</p>
<p>There was difference of opinion as to whom the obild of niyogs belonged. Vas. Dh. s. 17. 6 expressly refers to this divergence. The first view was that the child belonged to the begetter; this view would cut at the very root of the purpose for which niyoga was recommended. Nirukta 1426 III. 1-3 supports this view and relies on Rg. VII. 4. 7-8, Gaut. 18. 9 and Manu IX. 181 state the same rule. Ap. Db.8. 11.6.13.5 says that acoording to &amp; Brāhmaṇa text the son belongs to the begetter. The second view was that if there was an agreement between the elders of a widow and the person appointed or between the husband himself and the begetter that the child should belong to the husband, then the son belonged to the latter. Vide Gaut. 18. 10-11, Vas, 17. 8, Adiparva 104. 6. 1487 A third view was that the son belonged to both the begetter and the owner of the wife. This is the view of Nārada (stripumaa 58 ), Yaj. II. 127, Manu IX. 53, Gaut. 18. 13.</p>

<p>As shown above (in note 1418) niyoga was forbidden in the Kali age by Bșhaspati and it was included among practices forbidden in the Kali age by several works. Vide the Mit. on Yāj. II. 117 and Aparārka p. 97 quoting Brahmapurāṇa. 1487*</p>
<p>The practice of raising issue from the widow of one&rsquo;s brother or marrying her was a widespread one. Vide Wester marck&rsquo;s &lsquo;History of Human Marriage&rsquo; (1921) vol. III. pp. 207-220. In the Rgveda 1488 X. 40. 2 we read &lsquo;what sacrificer invites you ( Aśvins) in his house as a widow invites &amp; brother-in-law to her bed or as a young damgel her lover&rsquo;. But it is not clear whether this refers to marrying the widow of a deceased brother or to the practice of niyoga. Visvarūpa (on Yāj. I. 69 ) thinks that this refers to niyoga. The Nirukta (III. 15 ) explains Rg. X. 40. %, where in some mss. the word &lsquo;devara&rsquo; is explained as &lsquo;a second husband&rsquo; (dvitiyo yaraḥ). Medhātithi on Manu IX. 66 explains Rg. X. 40.2 as applying to niyoga. According to the sutras and smrtis niyoga was entirely different from marriage. In many ancient societies, women were inherited like property. On the death of the eldest brother, his younger brother took the family property as well as his widow. But the Rgveda had reached a stage much beyond that. Mac Lennan thought that the practice of niyoga was due to polyandry. Westermarck combats this view and rightlyso. When niyoga wag allowed in the sūtras, polyandry had been either unheard of or forbidden. Jolly in Recht und Sitte (English translation, pp. 156-157) thinks that apart from the religious importance of a son economic motives were at the bottom of the long list of secondary song, including the kṣetraja. This appears to be quite wrong. The practice of niyoga was a relio from the past and probably owed its origin to several causes, which are now obscure, but one of which was the great hankering for &amp; son evinced by all in Vedio times. Vas. Dh..(17.1-6) lends support to this view, since after quoting Vedio passages about the importance of a son for paying off the debt to ancestors and for seouring heavenly worlds, he at once proceeds to the description of the kṣeiraja. But the economio motive was never put forward by any of the sages, nor could it possibly have been the reason</p>

<p>and main-spring of the practice. If many secondary sons were desired for economio reasons, then the same man could have had any number of secondary sons. But the dharmaśāstra texts do not allow this. A man who has an aurasa son can have no kṣetraja or adopted son. If one kind of son was adopted, then another kind of son could not be adopted. So economic motives did not at all form the origin of this practice. Winternitz in J. R. A. S, for 1897 at p. 758 puts forward poverty, paucity of women and the joint family system as the causes of niyoga. There are no data to prove that there was paucity of women in India during historic times. There might have been a paucity of men owing to wars. Nor do the other two reasons bear cloge examination. It is better to say that niyog&amp; was a survival from the remote past, that gradually it became rarer and rarer till in the first centuries of the Christian era it came to be totally prohibited.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XIV</p>
<p>REMARRIAGE OF WIDOWS</p>
<p>Remarriage of widows.&ndash;The word punarbhu is generally applied to a widow that has remarried. Before going into the detailed history of the remarriage of widows it is desirable to probe into the meaning of the word &lsquo;punarbhū &lsquo;.1489 Nārada (stripursa, v. 45 ) says that there are seven sorts of wives (mentioned in order) who have been previously married to another man (parapūrvā); among them, the punarbhũ is of three kinds 1430 and the svairiṇi ( wanton woman) is of four kinds. The three punarbhūs are: (1) a maiden whose hand was taken in marriage but whose marriage was not consummated; in her case the marriage ceremony has to be performed once more ; (2) a woman who first deserts the husband of her youth, betakes herself to another man and then returns to the house of her husband ;(3) a woman who is given by the husband&rsquo;s relatives (when the husband dies) to a sapiṇda of the deceased husband or a person of the same caste, on failure of brothers-in-law ( this is nigoya and no ceremony is to be performed). The four svairinis are: (1) a woman, whether childless or not, who goes to live with another man through love while the husband is alive; (2) a woman who rejeots after her husband&rsquo;s death his brothers and the like and unites herself with another through passion for him; (3) a woman, coming from a foreign country or purchased with money or oppressed by hunger or thirst, gives herself to a man saying &lsquo;I am yours&rsquo;; (4) a woman who is given to a stranger by the elders relying on the usages of the</p>

<p>country, but who inours the blame of wantonness 1481 (as the smsti rules about niyoga are not observed by them or her). Nārada says tbat each preceding one of the punarbhūs and svairipis enumerated is inferior to the next in order. Yaj. ( I. 67) does not give this elaborate classification; all he says is that a punarbhū is of two kinds, one whose marriage had not been consummated and another who has bad sexual intercourse and that both have the marriage ceremony performed again (i. e, punarbhū is one who is &ldquo;punaḥ samskṛtā ); a svairiṇi is one who forsakes the husband whom she married when &amp; maiden and lives with another man of the same caste through love for the latter. Viśvarūpe on Yaj. I. 67 remarks that the elaborate classification of Nārada and Saṅkha (3 punarbhūs and 4 svairipis ) is not of much use, that it only indicates the various degrees of blame ( or sin ) attaching to them and is also meant to discriminate among prāyaścittas to be performed by those women. It is the second husband and the son of the Becond marriage that bear the appellation &lsquo;paunarbhava&rsquo; ( pati or putra respectively ) and not the first husband. Vide Sam, Pr. pp. 740-741.

According to Kasyapa 1438 the seven kinds of punarbhū are: (1) the girl who had been promised in marriage, (2) one who was intended to be given; (3) one on whose wrist the auspicious band was tied by the bride-groom, (4) whose gift had been made with water (by the father ), (5) whose band was held by the bridegroom, (6) who went round the fire, (7) who had given birth to a child after marriage. In the first five cases it is to be supposed that the bride-groom either immediately died or left the further pro secution of the marriage rites. Even such girls would be styled punarbhūs, when they married another person later on, though</p>

The 3rd kind of punarbhu refers to the practice of niyoga; the 4th kind of svairiṇi is one who is allowed to bave intercourse by her elders for procreating a son for her deceased husband but without observing the strict rules of niyoga laid down in the smitis.

<p>the first marriage was not complete because the saptapadi had not been performed. The sixth case is one of completed marriage (though it refers to only going round fire). Baudhāyana&rsquo;s seven varieties are slightly different, the first two being the same as Kaśyapa&rsquo;s: the others are (3) one who went round the fire (with the bridegroom); (4) one who took the seventh step; (5) one who has had sexual intercourse (either after marriage or even without it); (6) one who has conceived; (7) one who has borne 1438 &amp; child. These meanings of the word punarbbū must be borne in mind when one nieets with the word punarbhū in Vedio texts. That even the promise to give in marriage without the performance of any cere monies was looked upon as tantamount in its consequences to marriage follows from the words of Sukanyā quoted above (in note 1306) from the Sat. Br., where she had been only offered to the sage Oyavana by ber father, but where noceremonies had been perform od as none are described or referred to therein. Manu (IX. 69-70) confines the rules of niyoga to a girl who was only promised ( vāgdattā); while Vas. Dh. 8. XVII. 72 speaks of tbe vāgdatta and one given with water as still &amp; maiden, if no Vedio mantras have been repeated. 1434 Vas. Dh. S. XVII. 74 refers to the 4th variety of Baudbāyana. Yāj. I. 67 when he speaks of akṣatā refers to all the six varieties of Kaśyapa or the first four varieties of Baudbāyana and when he speaks of &ldquo;kṣatā&rsquo; he refers to the seventh variety of Kasyapa and the last three of Baudhāyana. Vas, Dh, 8. 1485 17 19-20 describes paunarbhava as the son of &amp; woman, who leaves the husband of ber youth and after having lived with another person, re-enters the house of the husband or 88 the son of a woman who takes another husband after leaving an impotent, outcast or lunatio husband or after the death of the first husband. Baud. Dh. 8. II. 2. 31 describes paunarbhava as the son of a woman who after abandoning an impotent or outcast busband goes to another husband. Nārada ( strīpumsa, v. 97), Parāśara IV. 30 and Agnipurāna 154, 5-6 have the same verse another husband</p>

<p>Remarriage of women</p>
<p>811</p>
<p>is ordained for women in five calamities viz. when the husband is lost (unheard of ), is dead, has become a saīnyāsin, is impotent or is patita.' 1426 Great controversies have raged round this verse. Some like the Par. M. ( II. part I. p. 53 ) give the easy explanation (always given about inconven nient texts ) that this verse refers to the state of society in another yuga (age) and has no application to the Kali age. Others like Medhātitbi (on Manu V. 157 ) explain that the word pati means only &lsquo;pālaka &lsquo;( guardian). Medbātithi 1487 (on Manu III. 10 and V. 163 ) is not dead against piyoga, but he is opposed to the remarriage of widowe. Even the Smrtyar thasāra ( which belongs to about 1150 to 1200 A. D.) mentions Beveral views viz. some hold that a girl may be married to another if the bride-groom dies before saptapadi, others hold that she may be remarried if the first husband dies before con summating the marriage, while still others are of opinion that if after marriage the busband dies before she begins to mens truate sbe may be remarried and some hold that remarriage is allowed before conception. 1488</p>
<p>Āp. Dh, S. II. 6. 13. 3-4 condemns remarriage if one has intercourse with a woman who had already another husband, or with a woman on whom no marriage samskāra has taken place or who is of a different varna, then sin is incurred; in that case the son also is sinful&rsquo;. Haradatta quotes Manu III. 174 and says that the son procreated on another&rsquo;s wife is called kunda if the busband is living, and golaka if the husband is dead. Manu V.162 is opposed to the remarriage of widowa ‘nowhere is a second husband declared for virtuous women&rsquo;; so also Manu IX. 1439 65</p>

<p>(&lsquo;in the procedure of marriage there is no declaration about the remarriage of widows ), Manu IX. 47 &amp; maiden can be given only once and Manu VIII. 226 (the Vedio mantras used in panigrahana are applicable to maidens only) are opposed to the remarriage of widows. The Brahmapurāṇa and other purīṇas forbid remarriage of widows in the Kali age ( vide note 1427 a above). The Sam. Pr. quotes a text of Kātyāyana to the effect that a girl, who has gone through the ceremony of marriage with a sagotra, may be married again and remarks that the text refers to the state of society in another yuga. This is the view of all the commentators and nibandha writers, Manu himself (in IX. 176 ) expressly allows the samskāra of remarriage in the case of a girl, whose first marriage has not been consummated or who left the husband of her youth, went to live with another and returned to the first husband. In this the author of the Manusmrti probably only reiterates popular usage whioh was too much for him in spite of his own view (in V. 162 ) denounoing remarriages. So it may be taken that Manu does not forbid the use of mantras in remarriage, but holds that even after the mantras are recited the remarriage of a widow is not dharmya (approved). It is said in the Mahābhārata ( Adiparva 104. 34-37) that Dirghatamas forbade remarriage and also niyoga. 1440 Manu himself speaks of the samskāra of a pregnant girl (IX. 172-173). Baud. Dh. S. IV. 1. 18, Vas. Dh. S. 17, 74, Yaj. I. 167 speak of the samskāra of remarriage ( paunarbhava samskāra ). Manu III. 155 and Yāj. I. 222 include the paunarbhava (the son of a punarbhū) among brāhmaṇas that are not to be invited at &amp; grāddha. Aparārka (p. 97 ) quotes a passage from the Brahmapurāṇa itself which speaks of a fresh samskāra of marriage for a child widow or for one who was forcibly abandoned or carried away by somebody, 1441</p>

<p>Remarriage when husband unheard of</p>
<p>613</p>
<p>following directions. &ldquo;448 &ldquo;If the husband has gone to a foreign country a brāhmaṇa wife sbould wait for eight years, but four years if she has not given birth to a child ; after that period (of 8 or 4 years ) she may resort to another man (then Nārada lays down lesser number of years for ksatriya and vaiśya wives). If the husband is known to be living then the periods are double of those stated above; this is the view of Prajāpati when no news can be had of persons and hence there is no sin if &amp; woman resorts to another man ( in such cases).&rsquo; Manu (IX, 76 ) By&rsquo;If a man has gone to a foreign land for doing some religious duty the wife should wait for him for eight years, six years if he has gone for acquiring knowledge or fame, or three years if he has gone on a love affair (or for another wife ).' Manu does not state what the wife is to do after these years of waiting. Vas. (17. 75-76) requires that &lsquo;the wife of one who has gone to a foreign land should wait for five years and after five years she should go near her husband.&rsquo; This may be all right as far as it will go. But if the husband is unheard of, how is she to reach him ? Vasiṣtha says nothing on that point. Visvarūpa on Yāj. I. 69 says that the periods of waiting prescribed for the wife of an emigrant are meant not for permitting niyoga thereafter, but for calling upon her to repair to her husband. Kautilya (III. 4) prescribes some interesting rules : &lsquo;the wife of one, who has long gone abroad, or who has become a recluse or who is dead, should wait for seven menstrual periods and for a year if she has &amp; cbild already. Thereafter she may marry the full brother of her husband. If there be many brothers she should marry one who is near in age ( to the first husband ), who is virtuous, capable of maintaining ber or who is the youngest or unmarried. If no such brother exists she may marry a sapiṇda of the husband or one of the same caste.&rsquo; The story of Damayanti suggests that when the husband was not heard of for many years, &amp; wife could marry again. Damayanti is said to have sent a message to Rtuparna that, as Nala was not heard of for many years, Damayanti was going to celebrate a syayam vara and Rtuparna hurries for it and does not think it a strange thing ( Vanaparva 70.24 ).</p>

<p>One question &ldquo;44raised by Dr. Banerjee is : what is to be regarded as the golra of a widow when she is to be remarried ( is it to be her father&rsquo;s gotra or of the first husband&rsquo;s ?). There are hardly any indications in the ancient smṛtis or commenta ries on this point. Visvarūpa1444 commenting on Yaj. I. 63 (on the word ' kanyaprada') observes that according to some the father gives away the bride even if she is not a virgin. So it appears that the father&rsquo;s gotra should be looked to in the remarriage of a widow. Vidyasagar, whom Dr. Banerjee follows, held the same opinion,</p>
<p>Certain passages of the Atharvaveda may be considered in connection with the question of the remarriage of widows. Atharva-Veda V. 17. 8-9 are &ldquo;445&rdquo; when a woman has at first even ten husbands, who are not brābmaṇas, if a brābmana takes bold of her hand (i, e, marries her ), he alone is her (real) husband. A brāhmaṇa alone is (a real) husband, not a kṣatriya or &amp; vaisya-the sun goes proclaiming this to the five (tribes of) man'. The first verse is not to be taken literally in tbe sense that a woman married ten persons in succession and that the 11th was a brāhmaṇa; the first verse contains rather what is called &lsquo;praudbivāda&rsquo; (poupous assertion or boast) and this is indi oated by the word &lsquo;uta&rsquo;. The verse may at the most mean that if a woman has first a kṣatriya or vaisya as husband, and she marries on his death a brahmana, then the brābmana is the real husband. The word &ldquo;pati' may also bave been used loosely and all tbat is meant may be that if a girl is promised to ten persons one after another and then lastly to a brāhmaṇa, the latter is to be accepted as the best.

<p>Remarriage of widows</p>
<p>615</p>
<p>Atharvaveda (IX. 5. 27-28) is &lsquo;whatever woman, having first married one husband, marries another, if they (two) offer &amp; goat with five rice dishes they would not be separated (from each otber). The second husband secures the same world with his remarried wife, when he offers a goat accompanied with five rice dishes and with the light of fees&rsquo;. Here the word punarbhū occurs. It is possible to hold that this may refer to the promise of a girl in marriage, subsequent death of the intended bridegroom before the marriage ceremonies take place and thon the bestowal of her on another. Whatever the meaning of punarbhū here may be, it is clear that some sort of sin or inferiority attached to her and that such sin or oppro brium had to be removed by sacrifices. Other passages are dis cussed later on. But it must be admitted that remarriage of women was not prohibited in the times of the Atharvaveda. In the Tai. S. III, 2. 4. 4 &lsquo;daidhiṣavya&rsquo; (widow&rsquo;s son) occurs, The grhyasūtras are silent about remarriage; 80 probably by that time it had come to be prohibited generally, though sporadio instances might have occurred. Among the brāhmaṇas and castes similar to them and holding or endeavouring to hold a high place in the hierarchy of castes widow remarriage has been forbidden for centuries. One of the earliest historical instances is the remarriage of Dhruvadevi, queen of Rāmagupta, who was after Rāmagupta&rsquo;s death, married by her brother-in-law Candragupta (vide Journal Asiatique for 1923, pp. 201-208, Sanjan Plates in E. I. vol. 18, p. 255, Indian Culture' vol. 4. p. 216, Harṣacarita VI, penultimate para). Among sūdras and other lower castes widow remarriage has been allowed by oustom, though it is held to be somewhat inferior to the marriage of a maiden. 147 Among these castes remarriage is allowed after the death of the husband or during his life-time with the consent of the husband who gives a writing called farkhat or sod-chetti ( a deed of release ). Such marriages are called pat in Mahārāṣtra, notra in Gujarat, udki in the Canarese districts. In some cases the caste in a meeting assembled takes upon itself to bring to an end &amp; marriage and allows the wife to re-marry. But the Bombay High Court does not recognize the authority of &amp; oaste to declare &amp; marriage void or to permit &amp; woman to remarry another person without the consent of the busband and have convicted of bigamy women re-marrying without the</p>

<p>consent of the first husband but with the permission of the oaste, 1418 In modern times, the Hindu Widows' Remarriage Act (XV of 1856) has been pasged mainly through the efforts of Pandit Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar. That Act legalises the marriages of widows notwithstanding any custom or interpretation of the Hindu Law to the contrary and declares that the children of such marriages are legitimate. Owing to the sentiment of oentu ries widow remarriage is still looked down upon and during more than eighty years since the Act was passed not many widows have taken advantage of it. The Census &lsquo;449 of India for 1931 discloses Certain appalling figures. Among infants of less than one year old there were in the whole of India as many as 796 males who were widowers and 1515 females who were widows, among children up to 5 years there were 12799 widowers and 30880 widows ( out of these last the Hindus contributed 10266 as widowers and 23667 as widows). It is true that amongst the castes to which most of these must have belonged widow remarriage is allowed by custom, but there must be # certain number of females who are widows before five, who cannot remarry by the custom of the caste and who would not dare to take advant age of the Hindu Widows&rsquo; Remarriage Act. Between the ages of 5-10, 11-15, 16-20 the numbers of Hindu widows for the whole of India are respectively 83920, 145449, 404167. The age of marriage for girls is rapidly rising owing to economic causes, the spread of literacy among the masses, and the opera tion of the Child Marriage Restraint Act ( XIX of 1929 ) and it may be hoped that these high figures of ohild widows will be substantially reduced in the near future. Persons finding fault with Hindu society for large numbers of child widows should not forget one thing. According to Hindu notions every girl must be married at any cost. Hence people rush into cbild marriages. But there has been no problem of old spinsters in Hindu society, as there is in Western countries, though it appears that in the near future that problem will arise even in India. Apart from the considerations as to religious texts prohibiting widow remarriage and the great concern among women for preserving a high ideal of chastity and single-minded devotion to the husband, many Hindus feel that, each girl</p>

<p>having been given one chance of marriage, if she becomes a widow, that is her ill-luck, but she should not be allowed to compete with unmarried girls in the marriage market, which is already overorowded with girls waiting to be married.</p>
<p>Certain verses of the Rgveda and the Atharvaveda have given rise to various explanations and opinion is divided as to whether they refer to niyoga, to the reinarriage of widows or to the practice of the immolation of widows. First the two Verses Rg. X. 18. 7-8 1450 which are part of a funeral hymn will be set out: &lsquo;Let these women, who are not widows and who have good husbands, sit down with clarified butter used as collyrium ; may the wives who are tearless, free from disease and wearing fine jewels (or clothes ) occupy the seat in front ( first). O woman! raise yourself towards the world of the living ; you lie down near this departed (husband ); come, this your wifehood of the husband who (formerly ) held your hand and who loved you has ( now ) been fulfilled&rsquo;. It is somewhat strange that Sāyaṇa understands the latter half as an invitation by the husband&rsquo;s brother to the wife of the departed to remarry him. But that meaning is far-fetched and does not bring out the proper force of &lsquo;hastagrābbasya&rsquo;, &lsquo;patyuḥ&rsquo; and &lsquo;babhūtha&rsquo;. The Asv. gr. 1451 (IV. 6. 11-12) prescribes that (in the expiatory rite performed on the death of an elder) the young women relatives should salve their eyes with butter with their thumb and fourth finger and with tender darbha blades and then throw the blades away, when the performer of the rite should look at them while they are salving their eyes with the verse &lsquo;imā nārir &amp;o.&rsquo;.

The San. Sr. S. IV.16.16 also directs that the verse Rg. X. 18. 7 is repeated when the eyes of women are touched with blades of kusa grass and XVI. 13. 13 says that Rg. X. 18.8 and Rg. X. 85.21-22 are called &lsquo;uttbāpinyah&rsquo; (verses addressed for making one rise). There is another mantra in the Atharva veda ( 18. 3. 1) and Tai. Ar. VI. 1 1452 &lsquo;Ob ( dead ) man! this woman choosing the world of the husband lies down by thee, the deceased, observing the old universal custom; bestow on her in this world offspring and wealth&rsquo;. The first verse ( i. e. Rg. X. 18. 7) contains nothing about niyoga or remarriage. It has been made use of for giving Vedio authority to the practice of sati ( which will be dealt with later on). That verse refers to the practice that young women of the household of the departed uged to go to the cemetery and applied clarified butter to their eyes ( by way of purification and dānti); this practice continued to the days of the Asv. gr, the Bpbad-devata (VII. 12 ) and the Baud. pitpmedbagūtra ( I.21.11). The two verses &lsquo;iyam nāri&rsquo; and Rg. X. 18. 8 are employed by the Baudhāyana-Pitsmedhasūtra 153 in the funeral rites, the first to be repeated when the wife is made to sit near the corpse and the next for making her rise. It is to be noted that Baud. directs that the corpse is placed on the funeral pile after the wife is made to rise from the vicinity of the corpse; while the Bpbaddevatā appears to suggest that the wife ascends the funeral pile after the corpse is placed thereon and then the younger brother forbids her with the verse' udirṣva &amp;o.'. But the Bphad-devatā 1484 does not mean that the wife burns herself on the funeral pyre and the brother-in-law contents himself with only repeating &amp; verse to dissuade her. The Rgvidbāna 1455 (III. 8.4) says that the brother-in-law should call back the wife</p>

<p>Remarriage of widows</p>
<p>619</p>
<p>of his sonless brother when she is about to ascend the funeral pyro for procreating asin on her with Rg. X. 18. 8. It appears that the verse Rg X. 18. 8 symbolically describes what even in the days of the Rgveda was probably only a tradition viz. that in hoary antiquity &amp; wife burnt herself with her husband. In the times of the Rgveda this practice had altogether ceased, but &amp; symbolical imitation of it had come into vogue, viz. that the wife ley near the corpse in the cemetery and then she was asked to get up and was told that by following ber husband to the Very doors of death she had fulfilled all that was expected of her and that she should return. The same idea is referred to by the verse' iyam nāri', but the latter half appears to refer to the practice of niyoga when it calls upon the departed to bestow on the wife offspring and wealth. It is possible to argue that Rg. X. 18. 8 also impliedly has niyoga in view. But both these verses do not expressly refer to the parctice of suti at all. They at the most might lead to the inference that the woman had either to marry the deceased husband&rsquo;s brother or go in for niyoga because the husband died sonless. The latter appears to me to be the more probable of the two hypotheses, if those are the only explanations. The symbolic use made in the gļhyasūtras and in the Bșhad-devatā of Rg. X. 18.8 shows that they practically are against the burning of widows. It is probable that these authors knew of the custom of niyoga, that it was not then much approved of and so they are silent about it, while the Rgvidhana which appears to be comparatively a late work takes the verse &lsquo;udirṣva&rsquo; as referring to niyoga ( which is most probably referred to in Rg. X. 40.2 ko vam sayutrā vidbaveva devaram). The consideration of the practice of widow burning naturally arises here from the above discussion and will be dealt with in a separate chapter.</p>
<p>Divorce In the Vedio literature there are at least some texts capable of being interpreted as relating to the remarriage of widows and we have the word punarbhū'. But as regards divorce there is absolutely nothing in the Vedic texts nor is there much in post-vedio literature. The theory of dharma fāstra writers is that marriage when completed by homa and saptapadi is indissoluble, Manu IX. 101 says &lsquo;Let mutual fide lity (between husband and wife ) oontinue till death; tbis in brief may be understood to be the bigbest dharma of inan and wife.&rsquo; In another place Manu (IX. 46) declares&rsquo;neither by sale nor by</p>

<p>History of Dharmasastra</p>
<p>(Ch. XIV</p>
<p>desertion is the wife released from the husband; we under stand that this is the law ordained by the Creator in former times.' The position of the writers on dharmaśāstra is that marriage is a saṁskāra, that the status of wife-hood arises from that samskāra, that even if the husband or wife became patita, the samskāra already performed is not annulled by that fact, that even if a wife committed adultery she still remains a wife and that when she performs a penance for her lapse, it is not necessary to have a fresh samskāra of marriage performed on her. 1486 We have seen (pp. 552-553) that a man was allowed to supersede a wife and marry another or others or to abandon bis wife altogether in certain circumstances. But that does not amount to divorce ( i. e. dissolution of the marriage tie ); the marriage is still there intact. It was also shown (at pp. 610-611) that according to Nārada, Parāśara and a few others a woman was allowed to remarry in case the husband died, or was unheard of &amp;o.; but according to the digests and commentaries these rules apply to a former Yuga ( age). Therefore divorce in the ordinary sense of the word (i. e, divorce a vinculo matrimonii ) has been unknown to the dharmaśāstras and to Hindu society for about two thousand years (except on the ground of custom among the lower castes ). Even when the husband was allowed to abandon the wife for her lapse, still she was in most cases entitled to at least starving maintenance. Therefore tyāga ( abandonment) was not only no divorce a vinculo at all but was not even a divorce a mensa et thoro (divorce from board and bed ). Later smitis and medieval digests could hardly conceive of any ground for which the wife could desert her husband altogether, though Nārada and a few others allowed her to desert one husband and marry another if he was impotent, or became &amp; gamnyāsin or an outcast. The Mit. on Yāj. I. 77 says that a wife is not under the control of her husband as long as he remains patita (outcast or excommunicated ) and that she should wait till he is purified by penance and restored to oaste and that thereafter she again becomes dependent on him. The gravest sins can be expiated by penance ( vide Manu XI. 89,</p>

<p>92, 101, 105-106 ); therefore it follows that a wife could not for ever desert even a patita husband. In modern times the Indian courts&rsquo;est have held that mere change of faith or Apostasy by a Hindu wife or husband does not ipso facto dis solve the marriage and that if the wife changes her religion and then marries another while the first husband is still living, she would be guilty of bigamy. Mere desertion or separation for many years or even adultery does not dissolve a Hindu marriago ( vide 42 Madras Law Journal 276 ). Only in cases where the husband or wife becomes a convert to Christianity, &amp; special procedure is prescribed for the dissolution of the original Hindu marriage by the Native Converts' Marriage Dissolution Act (XXI of 1866), which is not set out here as it is beyond the scope of tbis work to do so. Further, those Hindus who marry under the Special Marriage Act ( III of 1872 as amended by Act XXX of 1923 ) can secure divorce under the Indian Divorce Act ( IV of 1869). The Malabar Marriage Act ( Madras Act IV of 1896 ) forbids polygamy if the first marriage is registered and allows divorce (sec. 19 ) among those who are governed by the Marumakkata yam or Aliyasantana Law prevalent in Malabar.</p>
<p>The Artbaśāstra of Kautilya contains some interesting observations bearing on divorce.1458 A wife hating her husband cannot be released from the husband if be is unwilling (to let her go), nor can the husband release himself from the wife (if she is unwilling ); but if there is mutual hatred then release is possible. If &amp; man fearing danger (or injury ) from his wife desires release from her, he shall return to ber whatever was given to her (at the time of marriage). If a woman out of fear of danger (or injury) from the husband desires releage, the latter need not return to her what was given to her ( at the time of marriage ); marriages in the approved form cannot be dissolved.' Kautilya himself says ( in III. 2) that the first four forms viz. brāhma, prājāpatya, arṣa and daiva are dbarmya ( approved ), since they are brought about under the authority of the father. 1459 Therefore according to Kautilya there can</p>

But if the marriage was in the gāndharva, asura or rākṣaße form, then the tie may be dissolved by mutual consent, if both have come to hate each other. But he seems to hold that there can be no release at the instance of only one party to the marriage who has begun to feel aversion to the other party in whatever form the marriage may have been performed. Even in this latter nabe he apparently makes an exception, where physical danger is apprehended by one party from the other.</p>
<p>It is beyond the scope of this work to compare the law of divorce in other countries or under other religious systems. It may be stated, however, that according to the strict theory of the Roman Catholic Church the marriage tie is indissoluble, o though decrees of nullity of marriage were sometimes granted by that Church to those who could pay for them. In England after the Restoration divorce could be secured through the Parliament by a private Bill where a divorce &amp; vinculo matri monii was desired. But this method could be resorted to only by the rich, as the passage of a private Bill for divorce cost at least 500 £. The Ecolesiastical courts in Englaud granted divorces a mensa et thoro on the ground of adultery, cruelty or unnatural offences, though such a divorce did not dissolve the marriage. But this procedure also was costly, as even an un defended suit for divorce a mensa et lhoro would ordinarily cost from 300 to 500 £. Then came the Matrimonial Caures Aot of 1857 ( 20 and 21 Vic, chap. 85 ) by sec. 27 of whioh a wife could petition for divorce only if she proved that since the celebration of marriage the husband was guilty of inces tuous adultery, or of bigamy with adultery, or of adultery coup led with such cruelty as, without adultery, would have entitled her to a divorce a mensa et thoro or of adultery coupled with desertion. The Matrimonial Causes Act of 1923 (13 and 14 Geo. 5 chap. 19) placed women on an equality with men by allowing them to apply for divorce merely on the ground of adultery by the husband without having to prove anything more. Then the Act of 1937 known as A, P. Herbert&rsquo;s Act (1 Edw. 8 and 1 Geo. 6 chap. 57) allows the husband or wife to petition for divorce on four grounds. It will be noticed</p>

<p>from this that the absence of divorce and rigorous restrictions thereon are not a peculiarity of the Brabmanical religion or of the caste system, but existed even in 80-called progressive, casteless and Christian countries up to very recent times. In modern times even in Roman Catholic countries divorce is allowed on various grounds; and in India too efforts are being made to enact legislation permitting divorce among Hindus for various reasons. And it may be admitted that some legal provision is necessary for securing divorce in hard cases even as to marriages celebrated under the ancient sāstric system on grounds similar to those in the English Act of 1937.</p>

<p>SATI ( Self-immolation of widows )</p>
<p>The word is often written as &lsquo;suttee&rsquo; in English works and papers. This subject is now of academic interest in India, since for over a hundred years ( i. e. from 1829 ) self-immolation of widows has been prohibited by law in British India and has been deolared to be a crime. A portion of sec. 1 of the Regulation XVII of 1829 passed by the Governor-General Lord William Bentinck is set out below. We are now in &amp; position to take a dispassionate view of the practice, to trace its origin and follow its working down to the date of its being declared illegal. It is not possible in the space available here to go into all details. Those interested may read the latest book on the subject by Mr. Edward Thomson.&rdquo; The burning</p>

In an appendix the autbor gives extracts from the accounts reported by those who witnessed widow burning from 317 B. C. to 1845 A, D. Vide also Max Muller&rsquo;s H. A. S. L. p. 48 for references to the custom of widow-burning among Greeks and Soythians; Die Frau' pp. 74-79 for accounts of travellers and eye witueg808; Colebrooke&rsquo;s Miscellaneous Essay&amp; vol.

In the Travels of Poter Mundy (1608-1669) published by the Hakluyt Society in 1914 vol. II, pp. 34-36, the author gives an account of the burning of a widow at Surat in 1630 with a sketch showing the widow having on her lap the hoad of her deceased husband. That writer also notes that the practice had in his time become rare, as under the Mogal rulers a special license from tho Ruler or Governor was required. Similarly Barbosa (a Portugueso ) describes the burning of a sati in the Vijayanagar kingdom (vide translation by M. L. Dames, vol. I. pp. 213-216 ).</p>

<p>of widows was not peculiar to Brahmanism, as many are prone to believe, but the custom owes its origin to the oldest religious views and superstitious practices of mankind in general. The practice of widow burning obtained among ancient Greeks, Germans, Slavs and other races (vide &lsquo;Die Frau&rsquo; pp. 56, 82-83 and Sobrader&rsquo;s &lsquo;Prehistoric Antiquities of the Aryan People,&rsquo; English Translation of 1890, p. 391 and Wester marok&rsquo;s Origin and Development of Moral Ideas', 1906, vol. I, pp. 472–476 ), but was generally confined to the great ones, the princes and nobles.</p>
<p>There is no Vedio passage which can be cited as incon trovertibly referring to widow-burning as then current, nor is there any mantra which could be said to have been repeated in very ancient times 1468 at such burning nor do the ancient gphy &amp; sūtras contain any direction prescribing the procedure of widow burning. It therefore appears probable that the practice arose in Brahmanical India &amp; few centuries before Christ. Whether it was indigenous or was copied from some non-Aryan or non Indian tribes cannot be demonstrated. None of the dharmasūtras</p>

<p>except Viṣṇu contains any reference to sati. The Manusmrti is entirely silent about it. It is stated in Strabo (XV. 1. 30 and 62 ) that the Greeks under Alexander found sati practised among the Cathaei in the Punjab and that that practice arose from the apprehension that wives would desert or poison their husbands (Hamilton and Falooner&rsquo;s Translation vol. III ). The Viṣnu-dharmasūtra 1183 says &lsquo;On her husband&rsquo;s death the widow should observe celibaoy or should ascend the funeral pyre after him.&rsquo; The Mahābhārata, though it is profuse in the descriptions of sanguinary fights, is very sparing in its references to widow burning. Mādrl, the favourite wife of Pāṇdu, burnt herself with her husband&rsquo;s body. 1464 In the Virāṭa-parva Sairandhri is ordered to be burnt with Kicaka, 1465 just as in ancient times it is said there was a custom to bury a slave or slaves along with the deceased ruler. The Mausala parva ( 7.18 ) says that four wives of Vasudeva, viz. Devaki, Bhadra, Rohiniand Madirā burnt themselves with him and (cbap. 7.73-74) that Rukmiṇi, Gāndhāri, Saibyā, Haimavati, Jāmbavati among the consorts of Krṣṇa burnt themselves along with his body and other queens like Satyabhāmā went to &amp; forest for tapas. The Viṣnupurāṇa also says that eight queens of Krona, Rukmiṇi and others, entered fire on the death of Krsna.1468 The Sāntiparva (chap. 148 ) describes how a kapoti (female pigeon) entered fire on the death of her husband the bird. 1467 In the Striparva (chap. 26 ) the Great Epio describes the death cere monies performed for the fallen Kauravas, but no mention is made of any widow immolating herself on the funeral pyre though the chariots, clothes and weapons of the warriors are said to have been consigned to fire.

<p>that the practice was originally confined to royal families and great warriors even in India and that cases of widow burning were rare. Several texts are cited by Aparārka from Paighinasi, Angiras, Vyāghrapād which apparently forbid self-immolation to brābmana widows. 1488 The authors of digests explain away these passages by saying that they only probibit self-immola tion by a brāhmaṇa widow on a funeral pyre different from that of the husband i. e. a brāhmaṇa widow can burn herself only on the funeral pyre of her husband and if his body is cremated elsewhere in a foreign land, his widow cannot, on hearing of his death, burn herself later. They rely on the text of Usadas that a brāhmaṇa widow should not follow her husband on &amp; separate funeral pyre. The Veda-Vyāsa-smṛti ( 11.53 ) says that &amp; brāhmaṇa wife should enter fire, clasping the dead body of her husband; if sbe lives ( after her husband ) she should give up adorning her hair and emaciate her body by austerities.1469 In the Rāmāyaṇa, 1470 ( Uttarakāṇda 17. 15 ) there is a reference to the self-immolation of &amp; brāhmaṇa woman ( the wife of &amp; brahmarṣi and mother of Vedavati, who when molested by Ravana burnt herself in fire). The Mahābharata (Stri parva 23. 34 ff.) on the other hand describes how Krpi, the wife of Droṇa, the brahmana commander-in-chief of the Kauravas, appeared with dishevelled hair on the battle-field on the death of her husband, but does not say that she burnt herself.171 It appears therefore that the burning of brāhmana widows began much later than that of kṣatriya widows.</p>

In the Gātbāsaptasati ( VII. 33 ) there is a reference to a woman being decked for anumarana (Nirṇ, ed.). The Kāmasūtra VI. 3.53 speaks of anumarana. It has been shown (at p.579) how Varāha mihira admires women for their courage in being burnt with their husbands. The Harṣacarita ( Ucchvāsa 5 ) describes how Yagomati, the chief queen of king Prabhākaravardhana and mother of Harṣa, consigned herself to fire when the king was dying. But this is not a proper case of sati, as she burnt herself even before her husband died.

<p>in memory of satis and men. The Harṣacarita (V. 3rd para from end) describes how many of the king&rsquo;s friends, ministers, servants and favourites killed themselves on the death of Prabhākaravar dbana. The Rājatarangiṇi VII. 481 narrates how when the queen of king Ananta became a sati on her husband&rsquo;s death, her litter carrier and some other men and three of her dāsis followed her in death. There is the example of a mother burning herself on the funeral pyre of her son (vide Rājstarangini VII. 1380). We shall see later on that suioide at holy places like Prayage was practised for attaining heavenly worlds and bliss. Life seems to have been deemed of small account in those ages and though the death of women or men on the funeral pyre of the husband or for their masters appears to us sophisticated people of modern days as very horrible, it did not so appear to the ancients. Sati was not in historic times a practice imposed by priests or men on unwilling women. It somehow grew and it is improper to say that men imposed it on women. It may be that examples of sati ocourred because of the force of popular sentiment. It was first confined to kings and nobles, because the lot of the wives of conquered kings and warriors was most miserable in all countries as well as in India. Vengeance for the truculence of their husbands was wreaked on the poor wives by carrying them as captives and making them work as slaves. Manu (VII. 96 ) allows a soldier to retain women (probably &lsquo;slaves&rsquo;) conquered by him along with other booty. When queen Yasomati narrates to her son Harsa the great honour and glory that was hers during the reign of her husband king Prabhākaravardhana, she refers to the fact that the wives of the enemies defeated by her husband waved chowries over her. 1476 From kings the practice spread among brāhmaṇas, though as shown above, several smṛtikāras disapproved of the practice among brāhmaṇa wives. Once it took root learned commentators and digest writers were found to support it with arguments and promises of future rewards. Even in modern times we can secure learned writers to support any pet theory of a coterie or olique. When Manchester and Liverpool were prosperous, English economists preached the doctrine of free trade and laissez faire to all nations, but in more difficult times we bave now the apotheosis of Empire Preference and discriminating preference for home-made goods. Manu IV. 178 asks people to do whatever their forefathers did.</p>

<p>The rewards promised to a sati were as follows: Saṅkba and Angiras 1477 say &lsquo;she who follows her husband in death dwells in heaven for as many years as there are hair on the human body, viz. 33 crores of years. Just as &amp; snake-catcher draws out a snake from a hole by force, 80 such a woman draws her husband from ( wherever he may be ) and enjoys bliss together with him. In heaven she being solely devoted to her husband and praised by bevies of heavenly damsels sports with her husband for as long as fourteen Indras rule. Even if the husband be guilty of the murder of a brāhmaṇa or of a friend or be guilty of ingratitude, the wife who dies (in fire ) clasping his body, purifies him ( of the sin). That woman, who asconds (the funeral pyre) when the husband dies, is equal to Arundhati in her character and is praised in heaven. As long as a woman does not burn herself in fire on the death of her hus band she is never free from being born as a woman (in succes sive birtbs)&rsquo;. Hārita says that woman who follows her husband in death purifies three families, viz. of her mother, of her father and of her husband'. The Mit. after quoting the above passages adds that this duty of anvārohana is common to the women of all castes from the brāhmaṇa to the cāṇdāla, provided they are not pregnant or they have no young children ( at the husband&rsquo;s death ) 1478</p>

<p>way of blaok magic to kill his enemy. He says 147that though Angiras allowed &lsquo;anumarana&rsquo; it is suicide and is really forbidden to women. Just as the Veda says &lsquo;syenenabbicaran yajet&rsquo; and yet syenayaga is not looked upon as dharma, but rather as adharma ( vide Sabara on Jaimini I. 1. %), so, though Angiras speaks of it, it is really adharma; and that a woman who is in a hurry and extremely anxious to secure heaven quickly for herself and her husband might act according to Angiras, still her action is aśāstriya ( not in accordance with the sāstras ); besides apvārohana is opposed to the Vedio text &lsquo;ope should not leave this world before one has finished one&rsquo;s allotted span of life.&rdquo; The Mit. on Yāj. I. 86 coinbats these arguments. It says that śyenayāga is no doubt undesirable and therefore adharma, but that is so because the object of syenayāga is injury to another. Anugamana on the other hand is not so; there the result promised is heaven which is &amp; desir. able result and which is enjoined by fruti in such sentenoes as * one should sacrifice a wbite goat to Vāyu if one desires pros perity&rsquo;. Similarly the smrti about anugamana is not opposed to the fruti quoted, the meaning of which is different; that sruti means &lsquo;one should not waste one&rsquo;s life for securing heavenly bliss which is fleeting and insignificant as compared with the supreme bliss of Brahma knowledge. As the woman in anumarana desires only heaven, she is not doing anything cont rary to the sruti texts. This is the reasoning of the Mitakṣarā which looks like special pleading. Aparārka p. 111, the Madang. pārijāta p. 199, Par. M. II. part I pp. 55-56 follow the reasoning of the Mit. and add that the Vedic text about the allotted span of life is a general rule, while the smrti about anumarana is a special or exceptional sastra and so there is no contradiction as the rule applies to all cases outside the excepted one. The Madanapērijāta (p. 200 ) further explains that the texts about purifying a husband guilty of brābmaṇa murder are not to be taken literally but only as byperbolically extolling anvārohana.</p>

<p>The Sm. O. also expressly says that anvārohana, 1480 though re commended by the Viṣnu Dh. 8. (25. 14) and Angiras, is inferior to brabmacarya (leading a celibate life ), since the rewards of anvārohana sre inferior to those of brahmacary8. As against this may be cited the extreme view of Angiras &lsquo;for all women there is no other duty except falling into the funeral pyre, when the husband dies.&ldquo;148The Suddhitattva remarks that this extreme or sweeping statement is made by way of belauding sahamarana.</p>
<p>We saw above that brāhmaṇa widows were only allowed anvārohana, but not anumaraṇa. There were other restrictions enjoined by the smrtis on all widows&rsquo; wives who have &amp; child of tender years, who are pregnant, who have not attained puberty and who are in their monthly course do not mount the funeral pyre of their husbands' 1488&mdash;from the Bṛban-Naradiya puriṇa. There is a similar verse of Bphaspati. The wife who was in her course was allowed to burn berself after she batbed on the fourth day.</p>
<p>Apagtamba ( verse ) prescribes the Prājāpatys penance for a woman who having first resolved to burn herself on the funeral pyre turns back from it at the last moment. 1483 The Rajatarangini (VI. 196 ) refers to a queen who having pretended to have resolved on becoming sati ultimately regretted the step and turned back.</p>
<p>The Suddhitattva sets out the procedure of widow burning. 1484 The widow bathes and puts on two white garments, takes kuśa blades in her hands, faces the east or north, performs koamana (sip ping water); when the brāhmaṇas say &lsquo;om, tat sat&rsquo; she remembers the God Narayana and refers to the time (month, fortnight,</p>

She then calls upon the eight lokapalas (guardians of the quarters ), tbe sun, the moon, the fire &amp;c. to become witnesses to her act of following her husband on the funeral pyre, she then goes round the fire thrice, then the brahmana recites the Vedic verse &lsquo;imā nārir &amp;c.&rsquo; (Rg. X. 18. 7) and &amp; Purāṇa verse &lsquo;may these very good and holy women who are devoted to their husbands enter fire together with the body of the husband,&rsquo; the woman utters &lsquo;namo namah&rsquo; and ascends the kindled pyre. The long-winded preamble of the bamkalpa *arundhati&hellip; patipūtatvakāmā' is based upon the verses of Angiras quoted above (in n. 1477). Toe Suddhitattva as printed is corrupt but it appears that it read the last quarter of Rg. X. 18. 7 A8 *Orobantu jalayonim-8gne' ( let them ascend the watery seat or origin, O fire 1) meaning probably may fire be to them as cool as water'. Some writers have charged the brahmana priest-hood (or Raghunandana ) with having purposely changed the reading of the verge Rg. X18. 7 in order to make it suit the rite of immolating oneself in fire (i. e. agne' or &lsquo;agneh&rsquo; was substituted for agre). But this charge is not sustainable. That the verge Rg. X. 18. 7 as it actually is was held to refer to widow burning centuries before Raghunandana follows from the fact that even the Brahmapurāna 1485 and Aparārka ( quoted above on p. 628 ) take it in that sense. It was therefore not necessary to alter the reading. Furthor even if some priests or Raghunandana had changed it that fact would have been detected in no time, as in those days there were thousands of people who know every syllable of the Rgveda by heart. There fore it must be admitted that either the M89. are corrupt or Raghu nandana committed an inpocent slip. Tbat mantra was not addressed to widows at all, but to ladies of the deceased man&rsquo;s household whose husbands were living and the gļhyasūtra of Asy, made use of it with that meaning. Raghunandana, a profound student of dharmasastras and smrtis (and often styled Smārta-bhattācārya), could not have been ignorant of what Āśv. Baid.

<p>It appears from all accounts of travellers and others that widow-burning prevailed more in Bengal during the centuries immediately preceding its abolition than anywhere else in India. 1487 If that was so, there were certain good reasons for that state of things. In the whole of India, except Bengal, the widows of members in a joint Hindu family are only entitled to maintenance and have no other rights over the property of the family. In Bengal, wherever the Dāyabbāga prevails, the widow of a sonless member even in a joint Hindu family is entitled to practically the same rights over joint family property which her deceased husband would have had. This must have frequently induced the surviving 1488 members to get rid of the widow by appealing at a most distressing hour to her devotion to and love for her husband. This rule of the widow&rsquo;s right was not for the first time propounded by Jimūta vāhana ; he makes it clear that he followed a predecessor called Jiten driya. The figures given above lend support to the view expressed here, since Benares, where the rights of widows were insignificant, was responsible for a small number of satis only. It is impossible, however, to believe that the number of widows in ordinary stations of life burning themselves was very large at any time or that most of the widows that did so were coerced into doing it. There is a good deal of epigraphic and other evidence particularly in otber parts of India that rela tives tried to dissuade the widow from taking the step. Even in Bengal the number of salis must never have been very</p>

D. &lsquo;Happily the martyrs of this superstition bave never been numerous. It is certain that the instances of the widow&rsquo;s sacrifices are now rare &lsquo;.1489 The very fact that there was no disturbance of peace or ebullition of popular feeling or even any great verbal protest from the vast Hindu population (except a petition to the Privy Council) against Bentinck&rsquo;s sweeping measure indioates two things, viz. that the burning of widows was a rare occurrence and that people were not very keen on observing the practice nor bad they any very deep-seated convictions about its absolute religious necessity. 1480</p>
<p>Modern India does not justify the practice of sati, but it is &amp; warped mentality that rebukes modern Indians for expressing sdrairation and reverence for the cool and unfaltering courage of Indian women in becoming satīs or performing the jauhar for cherishing their ideals of womanly conduct. If Englishmen can feel pride in their ancestors who grabbed one fourth of the world&rsquo;s surface or if Frenchmen can feel pride in the deeds of their Emperor Napoleon who tried to enslave the whole of Europe and yet are not held up to ridicule or rebuke, there is no reason why poor Indians cannot express admiration for the sacrifices which their women made in the past, though they may condemn the institution itself which demanded such terrible sacrifice and suffering.</p>

<p>VESYA</p>
<p>Vesya-(Courtezan). This work dealing among other matters with the position of women and marriage in India would be incomplete if nothing were said about prostitutes and concubines. Prostitution has existed from the dawn of history in all countries and in the absence of statistics it is difficult to say whether it flourished more in one country than in another or whether it existed to a greater or lesser extent in ancient days as compared with modern times. The artiole in the Enoyolopædia Britannica on prostitution will be an eye-opener to many who will be inclined to turn their nose at Indian conditions.</p>
<p>From the Rgveda we find that there were women who were common to several mon i, e. who were courtezans or prostitutes In Rg. I. 167. 4 the bright Maruts ( storm gods ) are said to have become associated with the young (lightning), just as men become associated with a young courtezan. 1591 It has already been seen how in Rg. II. 29. 1 reference is made to a woman who gives birth in secret to a child and leaves it aside. In Rg. I. 66. 4, L. 117. 18, I. 134. 3 and other places jāra (paramour or secret lover ) is spoken of. In Gaut. XXII. 27 it is said that for killing a woman who is a brāhmaṇi by birth only and who subsists by harlotry no prāya citta is necessary but eight hand. fule of corn may be gifted. Manu IV, 209 forbids &amp; brabmana from taking food offered by harlots (vide also IV. 219); and Manu IX 259 requires the king to punish clever (or deceitful ) harlots. In the Mahabbārata courtezans are an established institution. The Adiparva (115, 39 ) narrates how a vesy &amp; waited upon Dhstarāṣtra when his wife Gandhari was pregnant.149 In the Udyogaparva ( 30. 38) Yudhisthira sends greetings to the vetyās of the Kauravas. Courtezans are describ. ed as going out to welcome Krsna when he came on a mission of peace to the Kaurava court (Udyoga 86. 15 ).

<p>is said that oarts, markets and courtezans also accompanied them (Udyoga 151. 58). Vide also Vanaparva 239, 37, Karnaparva 94. 26. Yāj. &ldquo;498 II. 290 divides concubines into two sorts, avaruddha ( one who is kept in the house itself and forbidden to have intercourse with any other male ) and bhujisya ( concubine who is not kept in the house, but elsewhere and is in the special keeping of a person ) and prescribes a fine of fifty paṇas against another person having intercourse with them. Nārada 1494 (stripumsa, 78-79 ) says &lsquo;intercourse is permitted with wanton women (svairipi) who are not brahmana by caste, with a prostitute, a female slave, or a female not restrained by her master, if these belong to a caste lower than oneself; but it is forbidden with women of superior caste. But when these very women are the kept mistresses ( of a person ) intercourse with them by a stranger is as much a crime as intercourse with another&rsquo;s wife. Such women must not be approached, though intercourse with them is not forbidden ( on the ground of caste &amp;o ), since they belong to another.&rsquo; On Yāj. II. 290 the Mit., after quoting the Skandapurāṇa to the effect that prostitutes constitute a separate caste being sprung from certain Apsurases (heavenly nymphs ) called pañicacūdās, states that such courtezans as are not kept specially by a person do not inour any sin, nor punishment at the hands of the king, if they have intercourse with men of the Bame or &amp; superior caste, nor do men approaching them incur any penalty if they are not avaruddha. But the men who visit tbem incur sin ( which is an unseen result ), since the smṛtis ordain that men should be devoted to their wives ( vide Yāj. I. 81) and the prājāpatya penance is presoribed for him who has intercourse with a vesyā (vide Atri v. 271). Nārada 14% (vetanasyanapakarma 18 ) lays down that if a public woman after getting her fee refuses to receive the customer, she shall pay twice the amount of the fee and the same fine shall be imposed on a man who does not pay the ( stipulated ) fee, after having had interoourse with a veśyā.

<p>Concubines being recognized by society, the smýtis provided for their maintenance. During the life-time of a person keeping a concubine, the latter has no legal right to proceed against tbe former. Nārada ( dāyabbāga 1996 52 ) and Katyayapa lay down that even when the property of a deceased person escheats to the king for want of heirs ( except in the case of the deceased being a brāhmana ) the king has first to provide for the main. tenance of the concubines of the deceased, of his slaves and for his grāddbas. The Mit. says that tbe concubines bere referred to are those oalled avaruddhā (and not bhujiṣya ) and that even the kept mistresses of a deceased brāhmaṇa are entitled to maintenance from his property.

Bai Monghibai have gone beyond the Mit. and have held that all concubines (whether kept in the house practically as members of the family i. e. avaruddhā or not so kept i.e. bhujigyā ) within the exclusive keeping of a Hindu till his death are entitled to maintenance from his property after his death, provided they are continuously chaste thereafter, W17</p>
<p>The rights of the illegitimate children of concubines to inheritance or maintenance will be dealt with later on under inheritance.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XVII ĀHNIKA AND ACARA</p>
<p>(Daily and periodical duties and ceremonies )</p>
<p>This forms &amp; very important topio of dharmasastra. The daily duties of the brahmacārin have been already desoribed above and those of the vānaprastha and yati will be spoken of later on. Under this section we are concerned principally with the duties of the snātaka (the would-be householder) and the grhastha ( the householder).</p>
<p>Before the āhnika duties are described a few remarks about the importance of the stage of householder would not be out of place. It has already been shown(pp. 424-425) how one school of dharmaśāstra writers represented by Gautama and Baudhayada looked upon the stage of householder as the only Aśrama. The eulogies of the housebolder are sung in numerous passages of the Dharmaśāstra works. Gaut, 1498 (III. 3) declares that the house holder is the source ( support ) of all the other aśramas, because the other three do not produce offspring. Manu (III. 77-78 ) states that as all creatures live by receiving support from the air, 80 other asramas subsist by relying for support on the housebolder and that as men belonging to all the three other orders ( aśramas) are supported from day to day by the house holder alone with (gifts of ) food and sacred knowledge, the housebolder&rsquo;s is therefore the most excellent asrama. Manu (VI. 89-90 ) reiterates the same sentiments under a different figure just as all big and small rivers find a resting place in the ocean, so men of all aśramas find support in the householder and the householder is declared to be the most excellent of all the asramas by the precepts of the Veda and smrtis, sinoe be supports the other three'. Viṣṇu Dh. 8. (59. 27-29 ) contains almost the same remarks as Manu. Vide Vas. VIII. 14-16 ( 15 being identical with Manu VI. $0). Vas. VII. 17 (and X. $1 ), Baud. Dh. S. IL 2. 1, Udyogaparva 40. 25 say that a house holder observing the rules laid down for him does not fall</p>

<li>6-7 states &lsquo;as all beings live on the support given by their mothers, so other āśramas subsist on the support of the order of householders&rsquo;.1100 In the same chapter ( verses 10-11) Kapila condemns those who hold that mokṣa (final release from samsāra ) is not possible for him who remaing a householder. Santi 12. 12 holds that, if weighed in the balance, the order of householders is equal to all the other three put together. Vide also Santi 11, 15,23. 2-5, Vanaparva chap. 2. The Ayodhyakanda 106. 22 also says that the stage of householder is the most excellent of all asramas.</li>

<p>The brābmaṇa householder is again divided into several varieties from different points of view. Baud. Dh. S. III. 1. 1, Devala ( quoted in the Mit. on Yaj, I. 128) and other works divide &amp; householder into two varieties viz. sāling and yāyā. vara, 501 the latter being superior to the former. 102 The salina</p>

<p>[ Oh. XVII</p>
<p>is one who dwells in &amp; house, is possessed of servants and cattle, has a fixed place and a fixed village and has grain and wealth and follows the life of worldly people; the yāyāvara is one who subsists by the best of livelihood, viz. picking up grains that fall down when the corn that is reaped is taken to the house or threshing floor by the owner and who does not accumulate wealth or who does not earn his livelihood by officiating as priest, or by teaching or by accepting gifts. Manu (IV. 7) appears to divide brahmana householders into four varieties, viz. one who possesses enough to fill a granary or &amp; store filling &amp; corn jar, one who collects as much as will Batisfy his needs for three days, or one who makes no provision for the morrow. Vide Santiparva244.1-4 and Laghu-Visnu II.17 for similar statements. The Mit. on Yaj. I. 128 says that &lsquo;salina is of four varieties viz. (1) one who maintains hinself by officiating as a priest, teaching Veda, accepting gifts, agriculture, trade and breeding cattle, (2) one who subsists by the first three out of the above six, (3) one who subsists by offioiating as a priest and by teaching, (4) one who subsists by teaching alone. Manu IV. 9 (as interpreted by the Mit.) refers to these four varieties. The Ap. Śr. (V. 3. 22 ) distinguishes between salina and yayavara.1503 The Baud. gr. III. 5.4 refers to yayavara. The word &lsquo;yayavara&rsquo; occurs in the Tai. S. V. 2, 1.7 1804 therefore the active man lords it over one who is easy going&rsquo;; but here the word has not probably any technical sense.</p>
<p>In the Vaik. VIII. 5 1505 (=D Vaik. Dh. S. I. 5) householders are divided into four classes. The first olass (called vartavrtti)</p>

<p>maintains itself by Agriculture, cattle-rearing and trade; the second ( salina ) observes various niyamas ( vide Yaj. III. 313 ), offers pākayajñas ( sacrifices of cooked food), kindles the srauta fires, offers the darśa and pārṇamāsa sacrifices each half montb, offers cāturmāsyas, in each half year offers an animal sacrifice and each year the soma sacrifice; the third (yāyāvara ) is engaged in the six actions viz. offering sacrifices of havis and somna, officiating as priest at such sacrifices, studying the Veda and teaching it, making gifts and receiving them, constantly attends his fires (srauta and smārta ), and gives food to guests that come to him; the fourth (called ghorācārika, one whose rules are awfully difficult to observe) is observant of niyamas, offers sacrifices but does not officiate at others&rsquo; sacrifices, studies the Veda but does not teach it, makes gifts but does not receive them, maintains himself on corn fallen in the fields &amp;c., is absorbed in Nārāyaṇa, performs agaihotra in the morning and evening, in Mārgaśirṣa and Jyaṣthe performs observances that are like the edge of &amp; sword and attends upon his fires with herbs from a forest. These four names occur also in Bphat-Parāsara P. 290 (Jivananda&rsquo;s ed.).</p>
<p>In numerous smrtis, purāṇas and digests the duties of householders have been described in detail. For example, vide Gaut. V and IX, Ap. Dh. S. II. 1. 1-II. 4. 9, Vas. Dh. S. VIII. 1-17 and XI. 1-48, Manu IV, Yāj. I. 96-127, Viṣnu Dh, 8, 60-71, Dakṣa II, Vedavyāsa III, Mārkandeya-puriṇa 29-30 and 34, Nṛsimha-purāṇa 58. 45-106, Kūrmapurana (uttarārdha ohap. 15-16), Laghu-Hārlta IV. p. 183 ff (Jivā nanda ), Dronaparva 82, Vanaparva 2. 53-63, Aśvamedhika 45. 16-25, Anusābana-parva 97. Among the digests may be men tioned the Sm. O. (I. pp. 88-232), the Smṛtyarthasāra (pp. 18-48), the Mudanapārijāta (pp. 204-345 ), the Gphastharatnākara, the Ābuikatattva of Ragbunandana, the Viramitrodaya ( Āhnika prakasa), the Smṛtimuktāphala (Ahnikakõnda). It would be impossible to present in the space at our disposal all the details of the duties of the housebolder contained in the vast sourcos indicated above. Some of the usual, out standing or important matters alone can be dealt with here. Some of the works contain moral exhortations to the householder. For example, the Anusaganaparva 1806 ( 141. 25-26)</p>

<p>says &lsquo;ahimsa, truthfulness, compassion towards all beings, quiescence, charity according to one&rsquo;s ability&ndash;this is the best dbarma for a gphastha (householder). Non-contact with the wives of others, guarding ono&rsquo;s wife and deposit (made by another ), abstaining from taking what is not given ( by the owner), avoiding honey and meat&ndash;this five-fold dharma has many branches and gives rise to happiness.&rsquo; Dakṣa (II. 66-67 ) also has similar provisions. But such moral exhortations (called sādhāraṇa dharmas) have already been discussed above (pp. 3-11).</p>
<p>From Very ancient times there were several ways of dividing the day. Sometimes the word &lsquo;ahah&rsquo; is distinguished from night and sometimes it stands for the period from sunrise to sunrise (and includes day and night ). For example, in Rg. VI. 9. 1 we have 1807 the dark day (i. e. night) and the bright day (i. e. the period when there is light). This part (viz. the period of sunlight) is divided some times into two parts viz. purvābna (period before noon ) and aparāhpa ( the time after noon ) Vide Rg. X. 34. 11, Manu III. 278. Day time is also divided into three parts, morning, midday and evening, which correspond to the three libations of Soma juice in prātaḥsavana, mādhyandina-savana and trtiya-savana. Vide Rg. III. 53. 8 where these three parts of the day are mentioned when Indra comes to drink Soma for a muhurta each time and III. 28. 1, 4 and 5 ( where all three savanas are named) and III. 32. 1, III. 52. 5-6. The day (of 12 hours ) was often divided into five parts, 1508 viz. prātaḥ or udaya (sunrise ), samgava, mādhyandina or madhyahna (mid-day), aparāhna (afternoon) and sāyāhna or astagamana or sāyam (evening). Each of these five parts of day time will be equal to three muhurtas. In some smrtis and purāṇas these five parts are mentioned and defined; 0. g. in the Prajāpatismśti,</p>

<p>The Madanapārijāta p. 496 quotes Vyāga for the fifteen parts of the day.</p>
<p>The smstis however generally divide day-time into eight parts. Dakṣa II. 4-5 divides the day into eight parts and then treats at length about the duties to be performed during those eight parts. Kātyāyana divides day-time into eight parts and asks the king to assign three parts after the first to the investi gation of judicial proceedings. 1510 That this was a very anoient division follows from several considerations. Kau ṭilya 1511 divides the day and night each into eight parts and prescribes what the king is to do in the eight parts of the day and also in the eight parts of the night. Vas. XI. 36, Laghu. Harita 99, Laghu-sātātapa v. 108 say &ldquo;the sun becomes mild-rayed in the 8th part of the day and that time is called kutapa &lsquo;.1518 The Kādambari of Bāṇa ( para 24 ) speaks of the light of the sun becoming clear and bright in the first eighth part of the day.&lsquo;13 In the Mahabharata frequent reference is made to the sixth part of the day as a somewhat late hour for taking one&rsquo;s meal (and as making one hungry ).

<p>The prinoipal matters to be disoussed under āhnika are : getting up from bed, gauca ( bodily purity ), dantadhavana (brushing the teeth), snāna (bath), saindhyā, tarpana, the five mahayajñas (including brahmayajña and honouring guests ), attending on fire, bhojana (mid-day meal ), obtaining wealth, studying and teaching, evening samdhyā, gifts, going to bed, performing saorifices at certain stated times. The Parāśara smrti I. 39 summarises the most important daily duties as bathing, performing the samdhyā prayers, japa, homa, worship of gods and honouring of guests, and vaiśvadeva are the sir (principal) daily actions.1818 Manu (IV. 152=Anugāsana parva 104. 23 ) also enumerates in one place the principal daily actions that must be got through in the morning viz. angwering calls of nature, toilet, bathing, brusbing the teeth, applying collyrium to the eyes and worship of the gods 1516</p>
<p>Although as stated in the Sūryasiddbānta 1517 the day was calculated from sunrise, daytime for practical purposes was extended for a short time before sunrise and after sunrise. According to the Brahmavaivarta-purāṇa the four nādis (or ghatikās) before sunrise and the four nādis after sunset are included in daytime ( dina ) i. e. when a man takes his bath before sunrise on a particular day that bath is one for the day that is to begin after be takes his bath 1518 Several smṛtis like Manu IV. 92, Yāj. I. 115 enjoin that a man should get up from bed at the brābma muhūrta, 1518 should reflect over dharma and artha that he would seek to attain tbat day and over the bodily efforts that he would have to undergo for securing his object and think out the real meaning of Vedic injunctions, Kullūka and others say that the word muhurta in Manu IV. 92 means</p>

<p>only time generally and not a period of two ghatikās and that it is called brāhma because that is a time when one&rsquo;s intelli gence and one&rsquo;s power to compose a literary work are at their best. The Par. M. (1. 1. p. 220 ) 1820 says that there are two muhurtas in the half watch before sunrise, the first of the two is called brābma and the second raudra. Pitāmaba quoted in the Sm. O. ( I. p. 88 ) says that the last watch of the night is called * brābms muhūrta&rsquo;. From very early times getting up before sunrise was prescribed specially for a student and generally for everyone. Gaut. 23. 21 says that if the sun rose while a brahmacārin was asleep he should stand up the whole day without food and mutter the Gāyatri throughout the day (as a penance) and if the sun set while he was asleep he should sit up the whole night engaged in muttering the Gāyatri. Ap. Dh, 8. II. 5. 12. 13-14 and Manu II. 220-221 contain similar rules and they employ the word&rsquo; abbinirmukta 1525 (or abbinimrukta) to denote one who is asleep when the sun sets. The Gobbila smrti ( in verse ) I. 139 says that on getting up one should wash one&rsquo;s eyes. In the Rgvidhana it is ordained that on getting up one should wipe one&rsquo;s eyes with water after reciting Rg. X. 73. 11 the latter half of which says &lsquo;remove away from us dark ness, fulāl our eyes and release us who are as if bound with snares.</p>
<p>The Sm. C. ( I. p. 88 ) quotes the Kūrmapurāṇa to the effect that on getting up from sleep some time before sunrise one should contemplate on God. The Abnika-prakāśa (p. 16 ) quotes five verses from the Vamanapurāns (14.23-27) wbich are to be recited on getting up as a morning hymn, one of which is quoted below. 1522 These verses are repeated even now by some</p>

<p>old people. Some works say that he who repeats the four verses called Bharatagāvitri in the morning obtains the reward of hearing the whole Mahabhārata and attains the highest Brahma, 1528 The Ahnikatattve (p. 327) quotes &amp; verse to be repeated on getting up from bed in wbich the serpent Karkotaka, Damayanti, kings Nala and Rtuparṇa are remembered for removing the effects of Kali, 1524 and the Smṛtimuktāphala quotes a verse about Nala, Yudhi ṣthira, Sitā and Krṣṇa as punyasloka ( singing of whose glory is holy ) 1525. The Acāraratna (p. 10 a) states that one should repeat the names of certain famous and long-lived (cirajlvins) personages viz. Aśratthaman, Bali, Vyāsa, Hanūmān, Bibhi ṣana, Krpa, Parasurama and Mārkandeya and also the names of five boly women, Ahalya, Draupadi, Sitā, Tarā and Mando dari. Even now old men brought up in the orthodox ways repeat these names on getting up.</p>
<p>In some works it is said that if on getting up a mon sees a brāhmaṇa learned in the Veda, a lady whose husband is living, a cow, an alter where fire is kindled, he becomes free from adversities and that if a man sees on getting up in the morning a very sinful man, a widow, an untouchable, one naked, one whose nose is cut off, that is an indication of kali (misfortune or strife ). 1526 Parāśara XII. 47 says that one who has built the fire altar (for Vedic sacrifices ), a dark-brown cow, one who is engaged in a satira (or performed it), the king, an ascetic, the oceanthese purify a man the moment they are seen, so one should see them always.</p>
<p>Then the next act is to answer the calls of nature. Very detailed rules are laid down about these even in the most ancient sūtras and smrtis. Many of the rules are simply hygienio, but as religion, rules of law, of morality, of health and</p>

<p>hygiene are mixed up in the ancient works, they are given in works on dharma. Even in the Atharyaveda (XIII. 1. 56 ) it 1887 is said &lsquo;I cut off thy root who kick a cow with the foot or who urinate opposite the sun (facing the sun); thou shall not further cast a shadow.&rsquo; Urinating while standing seems to have been condemned in the time of the Atbaryaveda; vide VII. 102 ( 107 ). 1 &lsquo;I shall urinate standing erect; let not the lords harm me.&rsquo; Gaut. IX. 13, 15, 37-43, Ap. Dh. S. I. 11. 30. 15-30 and I. 11. 31. 1-3, Vas. Dh. S. VI. 10-19 and XII. 11-13, Manu IV. 45-52, 56, 151, Yāj. I. 16-17, 134, 154, Viṣṇu Dh.

Nor should one answer calls of nature looking at or facing fire, the sun, the moon, a brāhmana, water, the image of some god, cow, wind. Nor should one do these acts on the bare ground, but on ground covered with dry twigs or leaves or grass or loose earth. One should oover one&rsquo;s head and should face the north by day or when there is twilight and face the south at night, but when there is a danger one may face any direction. One should not urinate while standing or walking (Manu. IV, 47) nor should one speak while doing so. 1829 One should answer calls of nature away from a human habitation towards the south or south west. Manu V. 126 and Yāj. I. 17 prescribe that, after answering calls of nature, one should perform cleansing the parts with water held in a pot and lumps of earth to such an extent that no smell or filth will stiok. According to Manu V. 136 and 137 and Viṣnu Dh. S. 60.25-26 one lump of earth is to be applied to the penis, three to the arms, ten to the left hand</p>

<p>and seven to both hands, three to both feet together. This is the extent of sauca required for householders, and for brabma cārin, forest hermit and sampyāsin, twice, thrice and four times As much is required. The Mit, on Yāj. I. 17 remarks that for all asramas the cleansing required is only as much as will remove foul smell and filth and the several numbers of lumps of earth prescribed in different smstis are only precribed for unseen ( or spiritual ) results. Gaut. I. 45–46, Vae. III. 48 and Manu V. 134 say that cleansing of the body is to be so effected first with water and then with earth that foul smell and filth will be totally removed. Devola ( quoted in the Gr. R. p. 147) says that respectable people do not emphasize the number of times mentioned in the smṛtis, but they say that cleansing should be carried on till one feels that it is all right. 1580 The Smṛtyarthasāra 1531 (p. 19 ) following Dakṣa V. 12 says that at night only half of the sauca prescribed for the day is required, only one-fourth of it is prescribed for the ailing and only one-eighth when a man is on a journey and that no special number of lumps of earth are prescribed for women, śūdras, boys whose upanayana bas not been performed. In cleansing one is not to employ stones, clods of earth, and green twigs cut off for the purpose from herbs and trees ( Āp. Dh. S. I. 11. 30. 30, Gaut. IX. 15 ) nor is one to use earth from inside a river or water reservoir or from a temple, from an ant-hill or from the hiding places of rats or from dung-hills or what is left after being used for a prior cleansing ( Vas, Dh. S. VI. 17 ) nor what is taken from &amp; road or cemetery, nor should one use earth that has worms, coals, or bones or gravel in it. Dakṣa V. presoribes that for the first time as much earth as will fill half of the outstretched hand and for the second time half of that is to be taken and so on.&ldquo;532 The lump of earth should not be bigger than a myrobalan fruit (Kūrmapurāpa in Sm. C. I. p. 182 ). One is not to answer calls of nature with the shoes on ( Āp. Dh. . I. 11. 30. 18 ) and one&rsquo;s yajttopavila should be suspended from the right ear or he should throw it on bis</p>

<p>This cleansing of the body in the morning is only a part of general sauca. Sauca is a ccording to Gaut. VIII. 24 one of the atmagupas. Even the Rg. (in VII. 56. 12 and other verses ) appears to emphasize cleanliness ( sucitva ). 1534 Aocording to Harita sauca is the first path to dharma, it is the resting place of brahma ( Veda ), the abode of sri ( prosperity ), the means of clearing (or soothing ) the mind, the favourite of gods, the means of realizing the Atman and the awakener of intelli gence.&rsquo; 1588 According to Baud. Db. S. III. 1. 26, Hārita, Dakṣa V. 3 and Vyāghrapāda (quoted in Sm. C. I. p. 93) sauca is of two kinds, 1586 bāhya (outward) and antara or ābhyantara (inward), the first being effected by water and loose earth and the latter is the purity of one&rsquo;s sentiments. Hārlta divides the first into three, that of kula ( being free from impurity due to birth or death in the family ), of artha ( i. e. of the vessels and things to be used in all matters ) and of sarira ( of one&rsquo;s body ); Hārita divides ābhyantara into five, mānaga ( mental ), cākṣuṣa ( of the eye i. e. not looking at things that should not be looked at), gbrānya ( of the nose), vāoya ( of speech ), svādya ( of the tongue). According to a verse quoted by Haradatta on Gaut. VIII. 24 gauca is of four kinds, viz, of dravya (the vessels and things employed by one), of the mind, of speech and, of the body. Vrddha-Gautama ( Jivānanda p. 632 ) speaks of five kinds of sauoa viz. of the mind, of actions, of kula (family ), of the body and of speech. According to Manu V. 135, Viṣnu Db. 8. 22. 81, Atri v. 31 and others there are twelve malas (filthy exudations or impurities) of the human body, viz. fat, semen, blood, marrow, urine, fæces, mucus of the nose, ear-wax, phlegm, tears,</p>

<p>After preforming sauca one has to rinse the mouth with twelve mouthfuls ( ganduṣa ) of water (vide Smṛtimuktāphala, abnika p. 220). When one finishes the purification of the body by washing the hands and feet and by rinsing the mouth one has to engage in ācamana. 1837 A good deal has been said about acamana above (pp. 315-316) under upangyana. Acamana (sipping water) is to be done after tying the top-knot and tucking up the garment from behind; the water is to be poured in the hollowed palm of the band in such a quantity that a grain of māsa ( bean) will be plunged in it and the three fingers except the thumb and the small one are to be joined together and the water is to be drunk from that part of the hand which is called brāhma tirtha describ ed above (n. 750 ). The word tirtha means that part of the right hand by whioh water is taken in or poured in religious rites and the parts are given the names of deities for lauding them, as Visva. rūpa says.1538 In most smrtis their number is four, viz. prājāpatya or kāya, pitrya, brāhma, and daiva (for example in Manu II. 59, Viṣnu Dh. S. 62.1-4, Yāj. I. 19, Mārkandeya-purāṇa 34. 103-109, Daksa II. 18). Some works like the Satyayanakalpa and Vṭddha Vasiṣtha quoted by Visvarūpa on Yāj. I. 19 name five tirthas viz. daiva ( when a brābmaṇa faces the east, the front part of his hand ), pitrya ( the right portion of the right hand ), brāhma (the portion of the hand opposite the fingers ), prājāpatys (the portion of the band near the small finger ) and parameṣthya ( the centre of the right palın). The Pār, gr. pariṭiṣta names the above five, except that it eubstitutes the name āgneya for parameṣthya. The Saṅkba-smrti (in verse, X. 1-2) distinguishes kāya and prājapatya and omits the name of brāhma altogether which is called prājāpatya by it. Vaik. I. 5 has six, the usual four, the fifth being āgneya ( centre of the palm ) and the sixth being ārza (the roots and tips of all fingers together). According to some, daiva tirtha means the tips of the fingers and the centre of the palm is either saumya or āgnaya. According to Harita the</p>

<p>daiva 1889 tirtha is to be used in mārjana, worship of gods, offering of bali and in bhojana; the kaya tirtha is to be employed in laja. homa (homa of fried grain) and daily homa, the pitrya in all rites for dead ancestors. Touching the kamandalu ( water jar ), eating curds and fresh products of the fields (navāgna ) are to be done with the saumya tirtha (Smrtyarthasara p. 20). When there is difficulty of getting water and an occasion for purifi cation by acamana arises, one should touch one&rsquo;s right 1540 ear. Very elaborate rules are laid down in the digests on the subject of āoemana (e. 8. Sm. O. I. pp. 95-104 ), Smștimuktāphala, Ahnika-prakāśa pp. 221-240, Ahnika-tattva pp. 333-344. Gr. R. pp. 150-172 &amp;c., which have to be all passed over for want of space. One matter to be noticed is that according to the Āpas. tamba-smrti ( in verse ) the procedure of acamana is of four kinds, viz. paurāṇika (in which each sipping of water is accompanied by the names, Keśava, Nārāyana, Madhava &amp;o.); smārta ( as laid down in the smrtis like Manu II. 60 ff), agama (i. e. taught in the sacred books of Saiva and Vaiṣṇaya secta rians ) and srauta (laid down in the Srautasūtras for Vedic sacrifices 154). The first of these four is the method usually followed now by most brāhmaṇas.</p>
<p>Danta-dhāvana ( brushing the teeth ).</p>
<p>Danta-dhavana comes after sauca and acamana and before snāna (bath). Vide Yāj. I. 98 and Daksa IL. 6. The practice of daily danta-dhavana has existed in India from the most ancient times. The Tai. S. 1548 (II. 5. 1. 7) when enumerating tbe actions which a rajasvala (a woman in her monthly period ) was to avoid mentions dantadhāvana among them and remarks that if she indulges in it during that period, she gives birth to &amp; son whose teeth are naturally black. Dantadhavana is an independent act by itself performed for rendering the body (here the mouth ) clean and it is not an anga ( 8 subordinate</p>

<p>constituent part) of bath or morning prayer. 1548 Āp. Dh, S. I. 2. 8. 5 forbids 1544 one who bas returned from his teacher&rsquo;s home after finishing his studies to engage in the sight of his teacher in such acts of pleasure as cleansing the teeth, shampoo ing the body and combing the hair and also forbids the study of the Veda while such actions are going on (ibid. I. 3. 11. 10-12 ), 1515 The brahmacārin was not to engage in the leisurely actions of brushing the teeth (but was to ringe his mouth ) according to Gaut. II. 19 and Vas. Dh. S. VII. 15.</p>
<p>In dantadbāvana one has to take the twig ( with its bark) of certain trees, crush the end of the twig with his teeth 80 as to make a brush of it and then to cleanse his teeth with the brush-like end. According to Gobhilasmrtilis (which is also oalled Chandoga-parisista in some works ) if a man only rinses his mouth with river water or at home, he has not to repeat a mantra, but if he uses a twig he has to repeat &amp; mantra &lsquo;Oh tree, bestow on me long life, strength, fame, brilliance, offspring, cattle, wealth, brahma ( Veda ), memory and intelligence.&rsquo; In the Par. gr. II. 6 and Āp. gr. 12. 6 brusbing of the teeth with an udumbara twig is prescribed in Samāvartana with a mantra &lsquo;may you be ready for food; here comes the king Soma; may be clean my mouth with glory and good luck.&rdquo; 1547 Therefore the same mantra is to be employed every day after samavartana.

<p>Very detailed rules are laid down about the length of the twig, about the trees the twigs of which are allowed or forbidden, about the days or occasions or times on which there is to be no dantadhāvana. A few of these details are given below. Trees having thorns on their trunk or from wbioh &amp; milky fluid oozes out when a twig is broken off are allowed and 80 are vata, asana, arka, khadira, karañja, badara, sarja, nimba, arimeda, apāinārga, malati, kakubha, bilva, amra (mango), punnāga, sirîṣa and further the twig must be astringent, pungent or bitter in taste and not sweet or sour.1548 Vide Bṭbat Sambitā of Varāhamihira chap. 85, Laghu-Hārita (Jivananda part I. p. 183), Laghu-Vyāsa I. 17-18, Nrsimhapurāṇa 58. 47. Before the advent of the modern dentrifrices people in India followed these directions and even now many even in the cities still follow them and brush their teeth with twigs of various trees. Among the trees which are not to be used for danta dhāvana are palāśa, 1849 śleṣmātaka, arista, vibbitaka, dhava, bandhūka, nirgudi, sigru, tilva, tinduka, inguda, guggulu, sami, pllu, pippala, kovidāra &amp;o. (Viṣpu Dh. S. 61. 1-5). The twig may be undried or dried, but one dried on the tree itself is not to be taken (Viṣṇu Dh. S. 61. 8, Nrsimhapurāṇa 58. 46 ). One must brush the teeth faoing north or east, but not west or south (Viṣnu Dh. S. 61. 12-13). Viṣṇu Dh. 8. ( 61. 16-17) pres cribes that the twig should be as big as the end of one&rsquo;s small finger and twelve angulas in length and it should be washed before its use and after using it it should not be cast off in an impure place. There are various opinions about the length of the twig employed. The Nṛsimhapurāṇa ( 58. 49. 50 ) says that it may be of eight angulas in length or a</p>

<p>According to Laghu-Harita (Jivānanda I. p. 183) and Nrsim. bapurāṇa 58. 50-52 there is to be no brusbing of the teeth with &amp; twig on the 1st tithi, the parva tithis (i, e, new moon, full moon, 8th day, 14th day and the day on which the Sun enters a new zodiacal sign, according to Viṣnu-purāṇa III. 11. 118), on the 6th tithi and 9th tithi and on those days when twigs are not avail able one may rinse one&rsquo;s mouth with twelve mouthfuls of water 1851, Paighinasi (quoted in the Sm. C. I. p. 106) says *one may brush one&rsquo;s teeth with grass, leaves and water and with the fingers except the 4th finger.&rsquo; One may also cleanse with mouthfuls of water when one has no teeth (Ahnika. prakāśa, p. 127). One may also rub one&rsquo;s tongue with these or with a twig on the days on which it is allowed. There is to be no dantadhāvana on śrāddha day (for the performer), on the day of a sacrifice, when one is observing niyama, when the husband has gone to another country, when there is indigestion, on marriage day, on a fast or a vrata (Smrtyarthasāra p. 25). Viṣnu 1658 Dh. S. 61. 16 prescribes dantadhāvana not only in the inorning but also after taking one&rsquo;s meal. This, as stated by Devala, is intended for removing particles of food sticking to the teeth or the gums.</p>

<p>other rites are to be performed after holding kusa grass in the right hand some remarks must be offered on kusas. The Kūrmapurāṇa says &lsquo;whatever action is done without darbha or without yajā pavita, it becomes useless and brings no reward here or in the next world&rsquo; (quoted in Kṛtyaratnākara p. 47). Sātātapa 1553 says &lsquo;in japa, homa, dāna, svādhyāya (study of the Veda) or in pit;tarpana one should have in his hand gold, silver and kuśas&rsquo;. One should have at the time of acamana &amp;c. &amp; pavitra (a ring-like loop) of darbhas in his right hand or in both his hands on the finger next to the small one or have kusa in his right hand. There were several views about wearing &amp; pavitra or darbbas, as stated in note 1553. The darbha grass is to ba collected on the darsa day (new moon) in the month of Srāvana and the darbhas so collected are never stale and may be used again and again 1554. The pavitra of the four varṇas should be made with 4 darbhas or with 3, 2, or l rospectively or it should be made with two darbbas for all (Smrtyarthasara pp. 36-37). Thoso darbha blades from which no further blades shoot forth are called simply darbhas, blades from which fresh oncs sprout forth are called kuśas, blades with their roots are called kutapas and those the tips of which are cut off are called trna 1665 (grass). The darbha grass growing in a field of sesame and having boven blades is very auspicious.</p>
<p>The darbhas to be used in yajñas should be green in colour, yellowish for use in pākayajñas, they should be with roots when used in rites for the pitrs and variegated when used in vaiśva deve. Those darbbas that were held in tbe hand at the time of offering piṇdas to the dead or in srāddhas or in pitstarpaṇa or at the time of urination or voiding fæces should be thrown away (Smrtyarthasāra p. 37). If kusa grass is not available, then kāsa or dūrvā may be employed instead.</p>

<p>The subject of snāna can be treated from various points of view. Snāna 1858 is either mukhya (principal) or gauna (secondary), the first being a bath with water and the second being without water. Each of these is again subdivided into various kinds. According to Daksa II. 48 snana is nitya (obligatory every day), naimittika (to be performed on certain occasions), and kāmya (to be performed only if one desires certain rewards). All the varnas 1557 have to bathe in or with water every day the whole body together with the head also (Baud. Dh. S. II. 4. 4, Manu II. 176 and IV. 82) and dvijatis have to do it with Vedic mantras. This is nitya. This 1558 is required to be done, because a man who has not bathed is not entitled to perform homa, japa and other rites (Saṅkha VIII. 2, Daksa II.9). The body is dirty and from it ooze various exudations day and night and a bath in the morning oleanses and purifies the body. In this way snāna has seen and unseen (i. e. spiritual) results 1558</p>
<p>Some works (Yāj. I. 95, 100, Laghu-Asvalāgana I. 16, 75, Daksa II. 9 and 43 &amp;c.), prescribe two bathsaday for brahmana house-holders, one before day-break and another at noon. There is only one bath a day for brahmacārins, two for forest hermits (Manu VI.6). According to Manu VI. 22 and Yaj. III. 48 the forest hermit has to bathe thrice (in the inorning, at noon and in the evening) and a yati has also to bathe thrice 1560. Though even now some orthodox brāhmapa householders do forform two baths a day, the usual rule for all Hindus (including even the sor oalled untouchables ) is to bathe once a day, which also has</p>

<p>been the general rule for centuries ( vide Smrtyarthasara p. 26 &lsquo;Barve vāpi sakrt kuryur). Snāna is usually done now before noon, that in the early morning being done only by &amp; yati, one observing a vrata, a brahmacārin, sacrificial priests, students of the Veda and those engaged in austerities (Smrtyarthasāra p. 27). The morning bath is to be taken immediately after brushing the teeth before day-break when one sees the eastern direction lit up by the morning rays of the rising sun (Viṣnu 161 Dh. 8. 64. 8). Gobhila-smrti (II. 24) says that 1568 one should not lengthen out the process of taking the morning bath (by repeating too many mantras ) as it would come in the way of performing the morning home at the proper time, which is between the first appearance of light and the sun&rsquo;s reaching about one cubit above the eastern horizon (Gobhila L 122-123 ). Vide Manu IL. 15 also. The mādhyāhna ( midday ) bath is to be performed in the fourth part of the day-time divided into eight parts (Dakṣa II. 43, Laghu-Vyāsa II. 9) and one has to bring together loose earth, cow-dung, flowers, whole rice grains, kuśas, sesame and sandalwood paste 1563. This midday bath is not to be performed by one who is ill. The third bath (in the case of forest hermits and yatis ) is to be performed before sunset, but not after sun-set or at night. No bathing is allowed for any one at night except when there is an eclipse or the sun passes into the zodiacal signs of Cancer and Capri corn (at night), a marriage, &amp; birth or death or when a vrata is undertaken with some object 1584. Night means specially the two middle watches (Manu IV, 129, Kullūka thereon and Parasara XII. 27 ).</p>

<p>The obligatory (nitya) bath is to be taken with cold water and ordinarily hot water is not allowed. Saṅkha (VIII. 9-10) Bays that if one bathes with heated water or in water belonging to another individual, he may effect the cleansing of the body but he would not secure the ungeen spiritual result of a bath. Dakṣa II. 64 is to the same effect 1505, Naimittika and kāmya baths must be performed with cold water, there is an option only as to nitya (daily obligatory ) bath (Garga quoted in the Sm. C. I. p. 123).</p>
<p>Manu IV. 203, Viṣnu Dh. S. 64. 1-2 and 15-16, Yāj. I. 159, Dakṣa II. 43, Vede-Vyāsa-smrti III. 7-8, Saṅkha VIII. 11 and others say that one must daily bathe in natural water, i. e. in rivers, in tanks connected with temples, in lakes, in deep reservoirs and in mountain springs. One should not bathe in water belonging to an individual (i. e. &amp; well or reser voir dug or dammed by him &amp;o.) but if no water is other wise available one may bathe with such water after re moving three or five lumps of clay (from the bottom of the reservoir 1568) or three or five jars from the well. The idea is that either the private owner would participate in the merit of the bath ( as Baud. Dh. S. II. 3. 7 remarks ) or that the bather inours &amp; fourth part of the sin of the owner of the water (Manu IV. 201-202 ). If no such water is available or one is unable to go to a river &amp;o, for a bath one may bathe in the court-yard of one&rsquo;s house with water drawn in a vessel (from &amp; well &amp;c.) till his clothes are wetted. The words &lsquo;nadi&rsquo; and garta&rsquo; (used in Manu IV. 203 ) are defined as follows: &amp; nadi (river) is one that has &amp; stream of water at least 8000 bows in length, wbile all other streams are called garta (a pool). As in the months of Srāvana and Bhādrapada all rivers are full of mud (rajasvalā is used in &amp; double sense ) one should not bathe in them in those months, exoept in rivers that</p>

Vide Viṣnu Db, S. 64. 17 wbich says that out of water drawn in a pot, water standing in a reservoir, a spring, a river, water in which noble men of the past bathed, Ganges water, each succeeding one is holier than each preceding one for &amp; bath. 1588</p>
<p>The actual bath is described differently in different sūtras, emṛtis and digests. Gobbila-smrti(I. 137) says 1588 that the morning bath contains the same procedure as the mid-day bath. The morning bath has to be brief, as already stated, in the case of one who has consecrated the srauta fires. The procedure of bathing will be indicated by a few brief extracts. The Viṣnu Dh. 8. (64. 18-22 ) says&rsquo;having removed 1570 the dirt from his body with water and loose earth, he should plunge in water, he should invoke the water with the three verses &lsquo;apo hi stba&rsquo; (Rg. X. 9. 1-3), with the four verses &ldquo;biranyavarnaḥ ( Tai. S. V. 6. 1. 1-2) and with the verge &lsquo;idamāpaḥ pravabata&rsquo; (Rg. I. 23. 22 or X. 9.8). Then while still plunged in water he should thrice mutter the Aghamarsang hymn (Rg. X. 190. 1-3, śtam ca satyam &amp;c.) or he may mutter &lsquo;tad vispoh paramam padam&rsquo; ( Rg. I. 22, 20 ) or the Drupadā Savitri verse (Vaj. S. 20. 20 ) or the anuvāka beginning with &lsquo;yuñjate mana&rsquo; (Rg. V. 81. 1-5 ) or the Puruṣasūkta (Rg. X. 90, 1-16). &lsquo;Having bathed he should, with his garment still wet, perform tarpana of gods and Manes while still in the water.

<p>Yogi-Yajñavalkys quoted by Aparārka and other works gays that when a man is unable to perform the elaborate spana described by himself and others, he should engage only in this; he should invoke the water, then perform acamana, then mārjana (sprinkling water on body with kuśa blades) and then snāns and muttering of Agbamarṣana (Rg. X. 190.1-3)1578 thrice. The Gr. R. ( pp. 215-217) quotes the method of snāna according to the Padmapurāna and the Nșsimhapurāṇa and remarks that the procedure in the Padmapurāṇa may be observed by all varnas and by men following all the different Vedio schools ( except the Vedio mantras in the case of sūdras). The Smrtyarthasara (p. 28 ) also gives a brief procedure of snāna.</p>

<p>There are certain rules to be observed when bathing. One was not to bathe naked (Gaut. IX. 61 and Manu IV. 45 ), nor with all clothes on (but only with the lower garment) nor after taking one&rsquo;s meal ( Manu 4. 29); one was not to rub the body in water but outside on the bank, one should not strike the water with one&rsquo;s foot or hand or dash a portion of the water against the rest. 1874</p>
<p>The earth to be employed (like soap) for cleansing the body was to be obtained from a pure place and not from an 875 ant-hill or from places infested by mice, nor from under water, nor from the publio road, nor from the bottom of a tree, nor from near temples, nor out of what was left by some person after using a portion for his own gauca and is to be invoked with two verses' aśyakrante 578 &amp;o.' Laghu-Harita ( v. 70-71 ) 88ys' earth seoured after digging eight angulas from the surface should be used, all earth is pure which is taken from a place not frequented by people and that ten kinds of earth should not be used at the time of bathing'(verses 72-73).</p>
<p>The brahmapārin was not to bathe in a leisurely or sporting manner but to dive in water motionless like a stick.</p>
<p>The Mahabharata, Daksa and others say that ten gocd consequences follow from snāna viz. strength, beauty, olearness of complexion and voice, (pleasant) toucb and odour (of the body ), purity, prosperity, delicacy and fine women.1578</p>
<p>Bathing with water is divided into six varieties by Saṅkba smrti (VIII. 1-11), Agnipurāpa 155, 3-4 and others, viz. nitya, naimittika, kāmya, kriyanga, malāpakarṣana (or abhyanga-snāna ),</p>

<p>Ahnika-procedure of bathing</p>
<p>665</p>
<p>kriyāsnāna. Nitya snana (daily bath) has been described above. A few observations are made below on each of the otherg, On certain occasions or on coming in contact with certain persons or things one has to bathe, although one may have already bathed that day. This is called naimittika ( due to some occasion or cause ) snāna. For example, on the birth of a son, in a sacrifice (at the end), on the passing away of a relative, in eclipses, one has to bathe and even at night 1898 ( Parāśara XII. 26 and Devala quoted above ). Similarly a man has to bathe with all his clothes on if he touches an outcast (who is guilty of one of the mortal eins), &amp; cāṇdāla, a woman who has recently delivered, a woman in her montbly course, a corpse, or one who has touched a corpse or one who has touched another that has come in contact with a corpse or when a man follows a corpse 1579 (Gaut. 14. 28-29, Vas. 4. 38, Manu V. 85 and 103, Yāj. III. 30, Laghu-Asvalayans 20. 24). According to Manu V.144, Saṅkha-smpti VIII. 3, Mārk, purana 34. 82-83, Brahmapurāpa 113. 79, Parāśara XII. 28, if a man vomits or has many purges ( ten or more ), if he has a shave or has a bad dream, has had sexual intercourse, if he repairs to a cemetery, or is covered with smoke from a funeral pyre or touches a sacrificial post or a human bone, he has to undergo a bath to purify bimself 1580. Ap. Dh. 8. L. 5. 15. 16 prescribes a bath if &amp; man is bitten by a dog and Gaut. 14. 30 prescribes it even for touching it. If a man touches Bauddhas, Pāśupatas, Jainas, Lokāyatikas, atheists, dvijātis living by condemned actions and sūdras he should bathe with his clothes 1581 on, Tho Mit. on Yāj. III. 30, the Sm. C. I. pp. 117-119 and other digests speak of snāna being necessary on coming in contact with</p>

<p>Kāmya-snāna 1688 (bath for some desired object) is that which is taken when one goes to a tirtha (&amp; sacred place ) or when there is some astrological conjunction like the moon being in the constellation of puṣya (vide Saṅkhasmṛti VIII. 4) or when one bathes in the morning in the two months of Magha and Phalguna for securing abundant pleasures.

<p>When a man applies oil to his body, uses myrobalans and engages in a bath solely for oleaning the body ( and with no idea of performing an obligatory duty or securing religious merit) that is called malāpakargaka or abhyanga-snāna. The Sm. O. I. p. 125, Aparārka pp. 195–196 and other works lay down elaborate rules about this snāna. One rule is that on certain tithis like parva (vide Manu IV 128 and Yāj I. 79 above on p. 204 ) there is to be no bath with oil &amp;o. It is said that ons desiring prosperity should use dried myrobalan (āmalaka) at the time of bath except on the 7th and 9th tithis and on parva days, 15** Vide Vāmanapurāṇa 14. 49 ff. (quoted in Sm. C. I, p. 125 ) for astrological rules.</p>
<p>When a man regards bathing at a sacred place the reward of his pilgrimage and engages in the procedure prescribed by Saṅkbasmpti IX. that is called kriya-snāna. 1688</p>
<p>A person who is ill may bathe with hot water or he may, if he cannot bear that, only wash his body except the head or his body may be rubbed with a wet piece of cloth. This last method</p>

<p>is oalled kāpila-snāna.&ldquo;586 There is another method where a man is ill and something happens on which it is absolutely necessary for him to bathe; in this case one who is not ill should touch him and then bathe himself and then again touch him and bathe; when this is repeated ten times the person who is ill is deemed to have become pure as if he had bathed.1887 In the case of a woman in her monthly course, if on the fourth day she has high fever, she is not to be bathed, but another woman is to touch her and bathe with all her clothes on and perform doamana and touch her and bathe again; this is to be carried out ten or twelve times and in the end the clothes worn by the ailing woman are to be taken off and new ones to be given to her and she becomes olean. 1188</p>
<p>The bath with water is called Varuṇa (as Varupa is the lord of waters, according to Rg. VII. 49. 3 yāsām rāja Varuṇo&rsquo; &amp;o.) and. Vāruṇa is the principal kind of bath. There are six kinds of gauna snānas which may be employed when one is either ill and so unable as to undergo a regular bath or when there is no time or room to take a regular bath. These six (with Varuṇa as the Beventh ) are enumerated and defined in Yogayðjñavalkya and other works and they are: mantrasnāna, bhauma, āgneya, vāyavya, divya, manasa. Daksa II. 15-16 and Parāśara XII. 9-11 mention these except bhauma and manage and employ the word brāhma in place of mantrasnāns. The Vaik. gr. (I. 2 and 5 ) employs both words &lsquo;mantra&rsquo; and &lsquo;gurvanujaa&rsquo; as synonymous. Garga and Bșhaspati omit bhauma and manasa and speak of sūrasvata-snāna instead, which consists in the blessing pronounced by a learned man in the case of a dvijāti, or a pupil or his son may you have a bath with golden jars of Ganges water and of other sacred waters ( vide Ahnika-prakasa</p>

<p>pp. 196-197). The mantrasnanalisg consists in sprinkling water with the verses &lsquo;apo hi stha ' (Rg.x. 9. 1-3), the bhauma (or pūrthiva ) in smearing the body with loose earth, āgneya in smearing the body with holy ashes, vāyarya in taking on the body the dust raised by the hoofs of cows, divja in wetting one&rsquo;s body with a shower of rain accompanied with sunshine and mānasa in reflecting on God Viṣnu.</p>
<p>___ Tarpana (offering water to gods, sages and Manes) is an anga (a subsidiary constituent part) of snāna, just as it is an anga in brahma-yajña. When a person plunges his whole body in water including the head, he has to perform tarpana while still standing in the water. Vide Manu II. 176, Visnu Dh.S. 64. 23-24 (quoted above in n.1570), Parasara XII. 12-13 for this. He joins his two hands together, takes water in the joined hands and casts the water into the stream in which he is standing. If he changes his clothes, then he may perform the tarpaṇa on the bank of the river. There was a difference of opinion about tarpana. Some saidisno that a man had to perform tarpana as an anga of snāna immediately after it and before samdhyā prayer and then again the same day as an ange of brahmayajña; while others held that tarpana was to be performed only once in the day after sandhyā prayer. One has to perform tarpaṇ&amp; according to the procedure prescribed in one&rsquo;s sakha (Vedio school) but Saṅkba prescribes a brief tarpana which consists in the words &lsquo;may the universe from Brahma down to a bunch of grass be satisfied&rsquo; (or satiated ) and offering three añjalis (joined hands) of water. When he performs tarpana</p>

He should then wring159l the ends of his garment and the water so falling down is deemed to be meant for the sonless deceased persons born in the family of the bather and he has to repeat &amp; verse to that effect. Further details of tarpaṇo are set out under brahmayajña below.</p>
<p>After one takes a bath one was not to shake one&rsquo;s head ( for getting rid of the water ), nor should one rub off the water on one&rsquo;s body with one&rsquo;s hand or with the garment already worn by one; one has to cover one&rsquo;s head with a turban ( to dry the hair ) and wear two fresh garments already washed and dried (Viṣnu Dh. S. 64. 9-13).</p>
<p>What clothes the brahmaoārin was to wear has already been stated ( pp. 278-279 ). A few words must be said about the olothes to be worn by a householder.</p>
<p>Weaving and woven cloth are frequently referred to in the Veda, generally in a metaphorical sense or in similes. Vide Rg. I. 115. 4, II. 3, 6, V. 29. 15, X. 106. 1. In Rg. VI. 9. 2-3, both warp (tantu) and woof (otu) are mentioned. The words used for garment are &lsquo;vāsas&rsquo; or &lsquo;vastra&rsquo;. In the Tai.S.(V1.1.1.3) it is said that kṣauma (linen) cloth is worn when &amp; person takes the dikṣā (initiatory rite) for &amp; Vedio sacrifice. In the Kathaka Nam. XV. 1 kṣauma cloth is said to be the fee in a certain rite. In the Atharvaveda VIII. 2. 16 we have the two words &lsquo;vāsaḥ&rsquo; (outer garment) and&rsquo;nivi&rsquo;(under garment) 1898 used with reference to the same man. In the Rg. the word &lsquo;adhivāsa&rsquo; is also used with reference to a garment which must have been some. what like a mantle or toga (Rg. I. 162. 16). In the Tai. S. II. 4. 9. %. the skin of the blaok deer is mentioned. In the Satin Br. V. 2. 1. 8 it is said that when the Nestr 1503 priest is about to lead up the sacrificer&rsquo;s wife he makes her put on a kusa upper garment (vāsas) or a kuśa skirt next to the cloth that</p>

<p>one who is initiated for the sacrifice wears. In the Bṛ. Up. IL 3. 6. there 1544 is a reference to cloth dyed red with safflower or woollen oloth that is whitish in colour. Rg. IV. 22, 2 and Rg. V. 52. 9 are interpreted by Western scholars as referring to wool on the Paruṣpi river being the best, but the sense is rather obscure. It appears from the above that cloth was either woollen or linen, that silken (or kusa ) cloth was worn on very solemn occasions, that deer-skin was also employed 88 covering and that cloth was also dyed red. Whether cotton cloth was known in the earliest Vedio period is not certain. It is clear that in the sūtras ( Viṣnu Dh. S. 71. 15 and 63. 24 ) and in Manu (8.326 and 12. 64 ) cotton cloth is known and so its use must have reached several centuries before the times of the sūtras. Arrian (tr. by MaoCrindle) says that Indian dress was made of cotton (p. 219).</p>
<p>The Ap. Dh. 8. (II. 2. 4. 22-23) requires that a householder should always wear an upper garment ( besides the lower one ) but allows him to have only the sacred thread instead ( if he be poor &amp;o.). Vas. Dh. 8. XII. 14 says that snātakas ( those who have returned from the stage of student-hood ) should always wear &amp; lower garment and an upper one, two yajñopavitas &amp;o. The Baud. Dh. S. 1. 3. 2. says the same and adds that a snā. taka should wear a turban, a deer-skin as upper garment, shoes and have an umbrella. Aparārka (pp. 133-134 ) quotes verses from Vyāgbra and Yogayājñavalkya to the same effect, the latter remarking that if one cannot prooure a second washed garment one may wear a blanket of wool, or bempen or linen cloth. Baud. Dh. 8. (I. 6,5-6,10-11) says &lsquo;among garments 1898 the one that has not been worn is pure and therefore everything connected with sacrifice and worship should be done with fresh (or unblemi shed) clothes. The sacrificer, his wife and the priests should wear garments that have been washed, dried in the wind and are not worn out by use; but in sacrifices performed for abhicāra (harm to one&rsquo;s enemies) the priests should wear clothes and turbang dyed red. In consecrating the Vedio fires one should wear clothes made</p>

Sabara on Jaimini X. 4. 13 quotes fruti passages to the effect that the sacrificer and his wife wear fresh unused clothes in the model sacrifice and in the Mahāvrata the sacrificer wears in addition &amp; tārpya (silk garment) and his wife wears one made of kuśa grass.&ldquo;596 Baud. Dh. 8. II. 3. 66 requires that one must wear an upper garment in five acts viz. study of the Veda, dedioation of a well or a tank &amp;o. to the public, making gifts, taking one&rsquo;s meal or doamana. Similarly the Viṣnupurana (III. 12. 20) requires that a man must not, with only one garment on, begin homa, the worship of gods and similar rites, study of the Veda, ācamana and japa. 807 Gaut. 9. 4-5, Āp. Dh. S. I. 11. 30. 10-13, Manu IV, 34-35, Yaj. I. 131 and others enjoin that a snātaka and a householder should wear wbite garments and they must not be worn out or dirty if he has enough (means ) and should not wear dyed garments or garments of high price (or gaudy ones) or those worn by another. $98 Baud. Da, 8. II. 8. 24 remarks&rsquo; what a man, while wearing reddish garments, does such as japa, homa, receiving gifts, offerings made to gods and Manes, does not reach the gods. 1899 Cloth dyed in indigo is also forbidden and a male has to undergo &amp; fast and take pancagavya for wearing such cloth. The Apastamba smrti (in verse ) chap. VI has several verses on cloth dyed in indigo. The Mit. on Yāj. III. 292 quotes verses 1-5 of Apastamba.

<p>yajāopavita, ornament, garland, or water-jar used by another but if a man is unable to secure one for himself, he may wear another&rsquo;s garment or shoes or garland after cleansing it. According to Garga quoted in the Sm. O. ( I. p. 113 ) a brāhmang should wear white garments, a kṣatriya red and brilliant ones, a vaisya yellow ones, a sūdra should wear a dark one that is dirty. The Mahabharata says that one has to wear garments at the time of worshipping gods that are different from those that one wears while walking on a road or when one is in bed 001. Prajapati quoted by Par. M. states that in tarpana one should wear silk cloth having a hem or one that is orange-coloured, but never one that is gaudy. Probably it is requirements like these that led to the practice of wearing silken garments at the time of meals and worship, which practice is observed even now in many parts of India. Manu IV. 18 and Viṣnu Dh. 8.71.5-8 presoribe that one must dress, speak and entertain thoughts that would be in keeping with one&rsquo;s age, occupation, monetary affairs, learning, family and country. The garments to be worn by the vānaprastha and samnyāsin will be discussed below. The sportis contain rules about tucking up the lower garment. A garment should be tuoked in three places i. e. when it is tucked near the navel, on the left side and behind on the baok. A brābmaṇa is said to be a gūdra as long as he has not tucked his garment bebind or allows one corner of it to hang down from bobind like a tail, or has tucked it in the wrong way or side, or bas wound part of it round his waist or has covered the upper part of the body with a portion of the lower garment. Vide Sm. M. (āhnika pp. 351-353 ) and Sm. C. I. pp. 113-114 for these and other rules about wearing garments.</p>
<p>After one bathes, one has to sip water ( Dakṣa II. 20. ff) and make marks on his forehead (variously called tilaka, ūrdhyapundra, tripuṇdra &amp;o.) according to one&rsquo;s caste or sect. In the Abnikaprakasa (pp. 248-252 ), in the Smrtimuktaphala (abnika pp. 292-310) elaborate rules are laid down on this subject. In the Brabmandapurāṇa 1008 it is stated that for making</p>

<p>ūrdhvapundra (vertical mark of a line or lines on the forehead) one may select earth from the top of mountains or from banks of holy rivers like the Indus and the Ganges, from places sacred to Viṣnu, from ant-hills and from the root of the tulasi plant. The thumb, the middle finger and the finger next to the small finger are to be used in making the mark, but the nails should not come in contact with the earth employed. The mark may be of the form of a lamp and its wick, or of the form of bamboo leaves or &amp; lotus bud, or of a fish or tortoise or &amp; conch and the mark may be in length from two to ten fingers. The marks are to be made on the forehead, the chest, the throat and its pit, on the abdomen, the right and left sides, the arms, the ears, the back, the back of the neck, after taking the twelve names of Viṣṇu ( viz. Keśava, Nārāyana &amp;o.) for each of the above twelve parts of the body. The tri pundra mark (three oblique lines) is to be made with holy ashes (bhasman) and the -tilaka with sandalwood paste.&ldquo;03 According to the Brahmāndapurāṇa, the urdhyapundra is made after a bath with loose earth in such a way that it resembles the outline of the foot (of Hari), 1604 the tripupdra with holy ashes after homa, and the tilaka (a circular mark) with sandalwood paste on worshipping gods (devapājā). The Sm, M. (āhnika p. 292) quotes Vasudevopaniṣad for making the urdhvapuṇdra mark on the forehead and other places with Gopioa ndana ( magnesian or calcareous clay ) or in its absence with earth from the roots of the tulasi plant. Sacrifice, gifts, japa, homa, study of the Veda, tarpaṇa of the Manes, if done without the ūrdhvapundra mark, become fruitless (according to Visṇu quoted in Sm. M. āhnika p. 292 ). The Vṛddha-Hārīta smrti (II. 58-72) has a long note on urdhvapundru. The Sm.M.(āhnika p. 296) notes that some texts of the Pāśupata and other Saiva sectarians run down Ardhyapuṇdra and highly extol the tripuṇdrs mark, while Pāficarātra texts enjoin the marking of the body with sankha, cakra and other weapons of Viṣnu and condemn tripundra.

I. P. 42). Works like Vṛddha-Hārlta II. 44-45, the Pșthvi candrodaya condemn the practice of branding the body with marks of the conch &amp;o. with red-hot iron as fit only for sūdras. The Smṛtyartha-sāgara of Chalāri quotes passages of the Vāyupurāṇa and Viṣnupurāna supporting branding. In the Kālāgnirudropa niṣad the procedure1605 of the tripuṇdra mark is laid down. Holy asbes are taken from the sacred fire with the five mantras &lsquo;sadyo jātam&rsquo; (Tal.

I. 114. 8) and mixed with water and therewith lines are made on the head, the forehead up to the ( middle of the ) eyebrows and eyes, on the chest and shoulders, after repeating &ldquo;tryāyuṣam Jamadagner' when applying the ashes to the forehead, &lsquo;kaśyapasya tryāyuṣam&rsquo; when applying to the navel (or chest) and so on (the head coming last ). The Saṅkhyāyana gṛ, says 1806 &quot; He makes the tripundra mark with ashes with the five formulas &lsquo;tryāyuṣam&rsquo; &amp;c. on his forehead, chest, right and left shoulders and then on the back; (by doing this ) he studies these Vedas, one, two, three or all.&rdquo; The Smrtimuktāphala 1607 (āhnika p. 301) quotes a passage from Baudhāyana in which the words of the exhortation to the pupil returning home &lsquo;bhūtyai &amp; pramaditavyam&rsquo; occurring in the Tai.

<p>of the tripuṇdra mark with ashes (bhūti). This is a fine example of how seotarians twist the words of ancient texts to bolster up their practices and dogmas. In the Kādambari (para 34 ) Hārita is described as ornamented by the tripuṇdra mark of ashes. The Acāramayūkha quotes &amp; verse from the Bhaviṣyapurāṇa of him who does not bear the tripuṇdra mark, truthfulness, sauca, japa, homa, pilgrimage and worship of gods-all this becomes futile&rsquo; and a verse from the Smṛtiratnāvali as to the parts of the body that are to be smeared with holy ashes, viz. the forehead, the region of the heart, navel, throat, shoulders, the joints of the arms, the back and the head. The Smṛtimuktāphala (ahnika p. 310) gives the following sage advice to the Saiva and Vaisnava sectarian writers that were guilty of running down the practices of each other. As one God appears in the form of various deities, all should worship their ( favourite ) god, whether Siva, Viṣṇu or any other, without indulging in the calumpy of other deities and they should wear the puṇdra mark that is deemed to be pleasing to any deity without calumniating other sect marks &lsquo;.1808 The Nirnayasindhu (II pariccheda ) when dealing with the 11th day of Aṣādha sets out from the Rāmārcana-candrikā passages about the marking of the body with conch figure by means of heated metal pieces and also quotes the Pythvioandrodaya and other works that condemn such practices and remarks that one may follow the siṣtus. The ācāraratna (p. 37 a ) states that votaries are of several kinds, viz. Saives and Vaiṣpavas who are purely followers of the Vedio cult, Saivas and Vaisnavas who follow both Vaidika and Tāntrika practices and the same two following purely the Tāntrio cult.</p>

<p>sun rises one oubit above the horizon (Gobhila-empti I. 123 ). 1809 The evening home is to be performed at a time when the stars clearly appear in the sky and the ruddy colour has left the western horizon (Gobhila-smrti I. 124). Aśv. Śr. II. 2 and Asy. gr. I. 9.5 state the time for morning homa to be up to the end of the period of sangava ( i. e. the second of the five periods of day time). Therefore some said that in order to perform homa in time one may perform the morning sandhya prayer even after homa. 1810 It has been shown above (p. 425 ) that the belief was that a man owed three debts one of which, viz. tbat to the gods, was discharged by performance of sacrifices and that a man had to perform agnihotrs ( fire worship ) to the end of his life. The fire to be tended was either srauta or smārta. As to the first there were certain rules. Oply a person that had attained &amp; certain age was to kindle the $rauta fires, viz, one who had &amp; son or had reached an age when he could have a son and whose hair was still black (i.e, who had not become middle-aged or old). There were two views on the necessity of kindling the srauta fires. Vas. Dh. 8. XI. 45–48 1011 says &ldquo;a brāhmapa must necessarily kindle the three srauta fires and offer (in them ) the Darśa-Pārnamāga (new moon and full moon sacrifices ), the Āgrayaṇa iṣti, the Cāturmāsyas, the animal and soma sacrifices. For this is enjoined as an observanoe and has been lauded as &amp; debt. For it is declared ( in the Veda)&rsquo; a brāhmaṇa is born</p>

<p>indebted in three debts, in sacrifice to the gods &amp;o.&rdquo; Sabara on Jaimini V. 4. 16 expressly says that there is no particular time fixed for kindling the sacred fires and that a person may do so the very day on which the pious desire to do 80 arises in his mind 161%. The Trikāṇdamandana I. 6-7 refera to the two views that adhāna (kindling of srauta fires) is nitya (obligatory) and the other view (discussed by Baudha. yana) that it is merely kāmya (to be performed only if one desires the fulfilment of certain objects). The person who had kindled the sacred fires offered his daily oblations in them. It is clear that even in very ancient times not many kindled the sacred Vedic fires. The Gșhya and Dharma gūtras often contain rules referring to those who had kindled the sacred fires and to those who had not. For example, the Asv. gs. I. 1. 4 quotes Rg. VIII. 19.5 &lsquo;the person who lays &amp; fuel stick on fire, or throws an oblation on it or offers it the study of the Veda, or who pays adoration to Agni, (in substance) offers a good sacrifice.&rsquo; Aśv. gr. then quotes &amp; brāhmana passage explaining 1917 Rg. VIII. 19.5 in which reliance is also placed on two more Rk verses (viz. Rg. VIII. 24. 20 and VI. 16. 47). The purpose of all this is to show that even the study of the Veda, the performing of namaskara and offering of a samidh in the fire are equivalent to a real sacrifice. That shows that it was not obligatory on every-body to kindle the three sacred fires. But it must be said that agnihotra was highly thought of in ancient India. Vide Chāndogya Up. V. 24. 5 for a verse extolling it.</p>
<p>The three fires (often called Tretā) are the Ahavaniye, Garbapatya and Dakṣiṇāgni. The Abavaniya fire-place is a square, Gārhapatya is round (as the earth is round) and Dakṣiṇāgni is in the form of half the orb of the moon (vide Vpadha-Gautama p. 604, Jiyananda). In the Brāhmaṇas and Srautasūtras ela borate discussions are held about the kindling of fires (agnya. dhana), about the several sacrifices, and the various details connected therewith. It has been decided, in view of the vastness of the subject of srauta rites and the academic nature for modern times of the treatment of most of those rites, to pass them over</p>

<p>in this work and to give in a separate chapter at the end of this volume only some information about the grauta sacrifices. For about two thousand years hardly any animal or soma sacri fices have been performed (except rarély by kings, nobles and rich people). In medieval times there were many brābmaṇas who performed the New and Full moon sacrifices, the Āgrayana isti and the Cāturmāsyas. But in modern times even suoh agniho trins have become very rare and in certain parts of India one can hardly find a single agnihotrin keeping srauta fires even among thousands of brābmaṇas.</p>
<p>Every one who has kindled 1014 the sacred fires has to offer every morning and evening the Agnihotra ( oblations of clari. fied butter ) in the grauta firos. Not only bas one who has consecrated the three sacred fires to offer agnihotra everyday, but also every householder has to do so every day twice, in the morning and in the evening. Vide Manu IV, 25, Yaj. I. 99, Ap. Dh. S. I. 4. 13. 22 and I. 4. 14. 1. &lsquo;For when a man is married, there are daily observances declared for him such as agnihotra, ( honouring) guests and such other proper actions&rsquo; (Ap. Dh. S. I. 4. 14. 1). The rules about the proper time of kindling fire and offering oblations and about the material of the oblations are the same for gphy&amp; rites as in srauta agnihotra (Asv. gr. I. 9, 4-6). The fire in which these daily offerings are made by one who has not kindled the three srauta fires is called anipāsana, āvasathya, aupasada, vaivābika or (-hana), smārta or gļhya or salāgni.1015 There are various views about tho time from which this fire is to be maintained. The view of the vast majority of writers is that the grhya fire is the nuptial fire which is kindled on the day of marriage by the newly married pair. We saw above (pp. 530, 557 ) that the Āśv. gļ. (I. 8. 5 ) directs that when the bridegroom starts after marriage from the bride&rsquo;s house for his own house ( whether in the same village or in</p>

I. 9. 1-3 says &lsquo;beginning from the holding of the hand (i. e. marriage ) he should worship the domestic fire himself or his wife, also his son or his daughter or pupil.1817 The worship of fire should be constantly kept up&rsquo;. A man&rsquo;s nuptial fire may go out and be may not re-instate it through neglect or other cause or his wife may be dead and he may remain a widower. In such cases he has to offer his daily offerings in the ordinary fire on which he cooks his food (laukika or pacana fire); so that so far five kinds of fires (viz. the three srauta ones, aupasana or grhya and the laulcika ) are spoken of. There is another fire called &lsquo;sabhya&rsquo; (which is the sixth). According 1618 to Medhātithi on Manu III. 185 the sabhya fire is that which is kept burning in the ball of a rich man for the removal of cold and for the diffusion of warmth. Vide Sat. Br. (8. B. E. vol. 12, p. 302 n 1), where the translator says that the sabhya fire was kept only by ksatriyas. The Katyayana Srauta sutra IV, 9. 20 prescribes that the sabhya fire also is generated by friction like the Gārbapatya fire. Ap. Śr, sutra IV. 4.7 says that the sabhya fire is to be kindled in the ball (of gambling, according to the com.) to the east of the place of the ahavaniya fire. The Smṛtyarthasāra (p. 14 ) 1619 Bays that a householder should maintain six fires, five, four, three, two or one, but should never remain without fire. When he keeps the tretā, aupāsana, sabhya and ordinary fire be will have six; when he maintains the tretā, aupāsa na and sabhya he is called pañcagni, who is among the brāhmaṇas that are pankti pāvanas (i. e. that sanotify the company at dinner). Vide Gaut. 15. 29, Ap. Dh. S. II. 7. 17. 22, Vas. Dh, S. III. 19, Manu III. 185, Yāj. I. 221. He who maintains treta and aupāgana will have only four, he who maintains only tretā</p>

But if one has no fire other than the ordinary one, every rite has to performed in it.

<p>Manu III. 76 (= Santiparva 264, 11) and Sm. C. I. p. 155, Par. M. I, part I, p. 130 for the eulogy of agnihotra.</p>
<p>There were other views about the time from which one was to begin keeping one&rsquo;sgrhya fire. Gaut. V.6, Yaj. I. 97, Par. gr.I.2and.others refer to an optional course viz. setting up the grbya fire at the time when one separates from other members of the family. The San. gr. I. 1.2-5 refers to four alternativea in all (including the two already referred to); the other two are: When 1021 a pupil is about to return from his teacher&rsquo;s hme, he may keep as his gshya fire that fire on which he puts the last samidh; or a person may, if he is the oldest son, keep the fire of his father on the latter&rsquo;s death or of his oldest brother on the latter&rsquo;s death (if there is no division and the family continues joint ). Baud. gr. II. 6. 17 says1888 that the gļhya fire for a person is one by which his upanayana is performed, that from upanayana to samāvartana the homa is performed only by uttering the vyāhrtis and with fuel stioks, from samāvartana to marriage with vyābftis and olarified butter, and from marriage onwards with offerings of boiled rice or barley.</p>

<p>The deities to whom agnihotra is offered in the morning and evening are Agni and Prajapati ( to the latter inaudibly ). According to some in the morning the sun takes the place of Agni (vide Baud. gr. II. 7. 21 quoted in n, 1622 Hir. 85. I. 26. 9, Bhār, gr. III. 3, Ap. gr. VII. 21 ).</p>
<p>The oblations are to be made in the morning and evening of cooked food, but only such corn as is fit to be offered to fire as havis is to be used ( Aśv. gr. I. 2. 1). It is either boiled rice or barley ( Ap. gr. VII. 19 ). 1083 Gobhila-smrti (1. 131 and III. 114) says 1624 that among havisyas the foremost are yavas ( barley ), then comes rice, but one should eschew māṣa, kodrava and gaura among corns even if nothing else is available, that if rice and barley are not available one may employ curds or milk or in their absence, yavāgū (gruel) or water. According to a verse quoted by Nārāyana on Aśv. gļ. I. 9. 6 ten materials oan be offered as havis into fire viz. milk, curds, yavāgū, clarified butter, boiled rice, husked rice, soma, flesh, sesame oil and water. 1625 Manu III, 257 specifies some articles as naturally fit for being employed as havis. Vide also Āp. Dh. S. II. 6. 15. 12-14. Though flesh is allowed as offering in some sacrifices it cannot be employed in the morning and evening homa (vide Āśv. gļ. I. 9. 6). The general rule is tbat when no partioular material is specified for home into fire, clarified butter is to be used as offering, and when no particular deity is mentioned, then the deity is to be Prajapati 1826 There is another rule that fluid materials are to be offered into fire with the sruva ladle, while solid havis is to be offered with the right hand 1687</p>

<p>The Gobhila gf. (I. 1.15-19) lays down that one is to kindle one&rsquo;s gļhya fire (originally or if it goes out) by bringing it from the house of a vaisya or from a frying pan or he may bring it from the house of a person who performs many sacrifices, whether he be a brahmana or rajanya or vaisya or one may produce it by attrition; this last is holy, but does not bring pro sperity. One may do as one likes 1628! There are similar provisions in sān. gļ. I. 1. 8, Pār. gs. I. 2, Āp. gs. V. 16-17. If the gshya fire goes out, the husband or the wife has to observe a fast that day as &amp; penance ( Ap. gf. V. 19).</p>
<p>The fire in which oblations are to be offered must be fed by plenty of dry wood, must be well kindled and smokeless, the cinders must be red-hot and it must be flaming up 1488. The Chān. Up. V, 24. 1 indicates that oblations were to be offered only on red hot coals. The Mundaka Up. I. 2. 2 says the same. Āp, Dh. S. (1. 5. 15. 18-21), Manu IV. 53 and others lay down that one should not come very near fire when one is not pure, one should not blow on fire with the mouth (to kindle it), nor should one place it under a cot &amp;c., one should not throw anything impure in fire, nor should one warm one&rsquo;s feet over it, nor should one place it towards one&rsquo;s feet ( when one is sleeping). Gobhilasmrti I. 135-136 says that one should not blow on fire with the hand or a winnowing basket or a darvā (ladle), but one may use a fan; some blow on fire with the mouth because fire was produced from the mouth and construe the words ( of Manu IV. 53 ) &lsquo;one should not blow on fire with the mouth&rsquo; as applicable to ordinary fire (i. e, one may blow with the mouth on srauta fires 1630 ).</p>

<p>Ahnika-daily homa</p>
<p>683</p>
<p>The daily homa must be offered by the man himself and Dakṣa says that the merit secured by performing homa by one self cannot be secured by getting it performed through another, but he adds that homa performed on one&rsquo;s behalf by a priest, by one&rsquo;s son, teacher, brother, sister&rsquo;s son,or son-in-law is oquivalent to homa made by oneself. 1631 We saw above (n. 1617 ) that the Asv. gr. (1.9.1) allows the wife, a son, an unmarried daughter or &amp; pupil of the householder to attend to the worship of the house.. holder&rsquo;s gļhya fire. San. gr. II. 17. 3 is to the same effect. The Smrtyarthagāra (p. 34) adds that the wife and the daughter Bhould perform all the acts in homa except paryukṣana. Ap. Dh. S. II. 6. 15. 15-16 1038 and Manu XI. 36-37 lay down that the wife, an unmarried daughter, a young married daughter, one who has studied little, a stupid person, a diseased person or one whose upanayana has not been performed should not offer agnihotra (on behalf of the householder); if they do so, they and he both fall into hell; therefore the person to offer agni hotra for another should be one proficient in srauta sacrifices and master of the Vedas. These passages have been explained by the Sm. O. (I. p. 161) and other writers as applicable to the performance of srauta sacrifices only; while as regards the daily homa in the grhya fire the wife and others specified by Aśv. are held to be competent if the sacrificer is ill or has gone abroad, Haradatta (on Asv. gr. I. 9. 1-2) says that either the husband or the wife must always be near the grbya fire. 1038 Laghu-AŚva layana (I. 69) says that one who has kindled the gļhya fire should not leave the boundary of his village without his wife, as the texta lay down that home is to be performed in the place where the wife stays. A brāhmana 1624 may go abroad on business, leaving his fire in charge of his wife and after appointing a priest ; but he should not stay away long without cause. A priest should not offer homa on behalf of a householder, when both the spouses are absent, because such homa by him in the</p>

<p>absence of both is useless. 1685 If an householder has several wives of the same caste or wives of different castes, the texts lay down who is to be associated with him in religious rites. Those rules bave already been set out above (pp.559-60). &lsquo;When &amp; householder&rsquo;s wife dies he should not give up his Vedic fires, but that ( i. e. the Agnihotra ) should be performed till one&rsquo;s life by means of an upādhi (i. e. by marrying another savarna wife or by associating with himself an asavarna wife )&rsquo; says Gobhila smști638 III. 9. Gobhila then refers to the story of Rāma, who performed sacrifices with a golden image of his discarded wife Sitā kept by his side. In spite of Gobhila&rsquo;s dictum, allowing a golden image or a kuśa representative of an absent or dead wife, Aparārka condemns the practice as opposed to the rule laid down by Satyāsādha in bis srauta sūtra &lsquo;there 1637 is no pralinidhi ( representative or substitute) in the case of the owner (i. e. yajamāna ), the wife, the son, the ( proper) place and time ( for an aot), fire, the deity (to be invoked ), of a rite and of a text ( directed to be employed in &amp; rite).&rsquo; His argument is that the wife&rsquo;s co-operation is required in such actions as looking at the clarified butter, in unbusking grains &amp;o, and as an image of kuka or gold cannot perform these acts, the imago cannot be employed in place of the wife. The Sm. C. replies to this argument by saying that the words of Satyāṣādha have reference only to a human substitute for a wife and that other smrtis allow a substitute made of gold or kuśa. For example, Vṛddha-Harita 1838 expressly pres. cribes that a man may perforın agnihotra and the offering of the five daily sacrifices throughout his life in the company of his wife&rsquo;s image made of kusa grass (if the wife be dead &amp;o.).

<p>Not kindling Vedio fires when one was competent to do so and giving up srauta and smārta fires were looked upon as upapātakas by Yaj. III. 234, 239, Viṣnu Dh. 8. 37. 28 and 54. 13. The Vas. Dh. S. III. 1 gays 1641 that those who do not study or teach the Veda or who do not maintain the sacred fires become equal to śūdras. Gārgya as quoted in the Sm. C. (I. p. 156) avers that if &amp; dvija remains after marriage without fires even for a moment ( when he has the power and authority to maintain them ) he becomes a vrālya and patita. The Mun. daka Up. I. 2. 3 declares that if a person fails to perform the Darsa-Pūrpamāsa and other sacrifices and Vaiśvadeva, bis seven holy worlds are destroyed. The Tai. 8. I. 5.2.1 and the Kathaka S. IX. 2, declare &lsquo;He who makes the sacred ) fires go out (be extinguished) is indeed a killer of a hero in the eyes of the gods and brāhmaṇas who are anxiously devoted to ta (righteousness or correct order ) did not formerly eat food at his house&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The texts (such as Yaj. I. 99 ) prescribe japa (muttering of Gāyatrl and other holy Vedio mantras ) as part of samdhyā adoration. This has been already referred to above (p. 313). Yāj. I. 99 speaks of japa (of verses addressed to the Sun) after morning home and then in I. 101 again prescribes japa after the midday bath of philosophical texts (like the Upaniṣads, as stated in Gaut. 19. 12 and Vas. Dh. 8. 22. 9). Vas. Dh. S. 28. 10-15 are Verses which mention several hymns principally of the Rgveda, by reciting which ( inaudibly ) several times a man becomes pure.

<p>of those Vedic texts are well known, such as Aghamarṣaṇa (Rg. X. 190. 1-3), Payamāni versos (Rg. IX), Satarudriya (Tai. S. IV, 5, 1-11), Trisuparpa (Tai. Ār. X. 48-50 ) &amp;o. Manu II. 87, Vas. 26. 11, Saṅkhasmrti XII. 28, Viṣnu Dh. 8. 55, 21 say that a brāhmaṇa attains the highest perfection by japa alone, even if he does not do anything else. Gobhila smrti II. 17 says that one should inaudibly repeat as much of the Veda from the beginning as one oan and that japa may be performed before tarpana or after the morning homa or at the end of vaiśvadeve and that it constitutes brahmayajña (II. 28-29). Viṣṇu Dh. 8.(64. 36-39) avers that japo should comprise sacred hymns, particularly the Gayatri and Puruṣasūkta, as notbing else is superior to these. 1643 Japa is of three kinds, vūcika (audibly uttered), upāṁsu ( inaudibly uttered) and mānasa ( mentally revolved), each succeeding one being ten times superior to each preceding one (Laghu-Harita 1648 chap. IV, p. 186, Jivānanda I). Vide Manu II. 85 ( = Vas. 26. 9, Śankha XII. 29 ). Japa is one of the removers of sin (Gaut. 19. 11). Japa is to be performed sitting on a seat of kuśa grass, either in the house, or on a river bank, or in a cowpen, or in a fire room or at tirthas or before images of gods or before an image of Viṣṇu, each succeeding place being many times superior to each preceding one. 1644 One is not to speak while engaged in japa. A brahmacāri or a householder who has consecrated sgored fires should mutter the Gayatri 108 times, while &amp; vānaprastha and yati should repeat it more than 1000 times. Vide Manu II. 101 also about the extent of the time to be devoted to japa. When in the middle ages Vedic learning declined and Puranas came to the fore, the writers of the digests stated that one who has studied the whole Veda should repeat daily from the beginning of the Veda as much as he could; if one has studied only &amp; portion of the Veda, then one should recite in his japa the Puruṣesākta (Rg.

<p>Gayatri should repeat the texts of the purāpas. 1848 Vṛddha Harita (VI. 33, 45, 163, 213) prescribes that the mantra of 6 letters (om namo Viṣnave), eight letters (om namo Vasudeviya) or of twelve letters (om naino bhagavate Vasudevāya) should be repeated 1008 or 108 times. The counting of the mantra as repeated so many times has to be done by means of one&rsquo;s fingers (except the thumb) or by drawing lines (on the ground or walls &amp;c.), or by telling the beads of &amp; rosary, as japa without counting the number is fruitless 1646. Saṅkha-smrti (ohap. XII. in prose) lays down that the rosary should have beads of gold or precious stones or pearls or orystal or rudrākṣa, padm. kṣa (lotus seed) or putrajsvaka or a man may count by knots of kusa grass or by bending the fingers of the left hand. 1647 Bphat-Parāśara V. p. 85 and Laghu-Vyāsa (Jivananda part II. p. 375) contain similar provisions about aksamalā and counting of japa. They add &lsquo;indrākṣa&rsquo; to the different kinds of beads. The rosary should have 108 beads (this is the best) or 54 (middling) or 27 (this is the lowest number of beads in a rosary). 1848 Kalidasa (in his Raghuvamsa XI. 66) mentions that the hero Parasurama had on his right ear &amp; rosary of akṣa seeds. Bana ( Kadambari para 37 ) speaks of counting by means of rings of rudrākṣas. Vide Sm. O. I. pp. 152-153, Par, M.

<p>dūry 1649 &amp;o. Vide Manu IV. 152 quoted above (p. 646). What objects a man should see on getting up has already been stated (p. 648). Acoording to Nārada ( prakirṇaka vv. 54-55 ) there are eight mangala objects viz. a brāhmaṇa, a cow, fire, gold, clarified butter, the sun, water and the king and if one sees, bows to or circumambulates these, one&rsquo;s life is lengthened.1050 The Vāmana-purāṇa (14. 35-37) mentions numerous objeots that are auspicious and that one should touch or see before going out.161 The Matsyapurāṇa 243 enumerates in 26 verges numerous auspicious and inauspicious objects ( these are quoted in Gr. R. pp. 553-554). Viṇpu Dh. S. 23. 58 enumerates six objects derived from the cow as auspicious. Vide Adiparva 29. 34, Dronaparva 127. 14 (for touching eight mangalas ), śānti 40,7, Anuśāsana 126. 18 and 131. 8. According to the Viṣṇu Dh. 8. 63. 26 one should start on a journey after seeing such objects as fire, a brāhmaṇa, hetaera, &amp; jar full of water, a mirror, &amp; banner, a parasol, palaces, fans, ohowries &amp;c.

S. 63. 27-31 states that wlien, on leaving one&rsquo;s house, one sees certain persons or objeots one should return to the house and then restart viz. a drunkard, a lunatic, a cripple, one who has vomited or has undergone a purge, one who is completely shaved, one with dirty clothes, one baving matted hair, a dwarf, one wearing orange-coloured clothes, en ascetic &amp;o.</p>

<p>householder was to work and find out the means of maintaining those dependent on him ( Dakṣa II. 35 ). The different ways of maintaining oneself in the case of brāhmaṇas have already been spoken of above (pp. 105–134). Gaut. IX. 63, Yāj. I. 100, Manu IV. 33, Visṇu 63.1 and others say that a brāhmaṇa householder should approach a king or other rich person for the wherewithal to maintain his family. The persons whom every one must maintain have already been pointed out on p. 569 (Dakṣa II. 36) In the case of the well-to-do, there are other persons who should be maintained viz. agnates and cognates, one who is without means, helpless or has taken shelter 1852. In this world only that man may be said to live on whom many depend for their livelihood; other men who only fill their own belly are really dead, though living (Dakṣa II. 40 ).</p>
<p>In the fourth part 1864 of the day (i. e. before noon) one was to have the mid-day bath (with tarpana) and then the mid-day samdhyā prayer and devapūjā &amp;o. (Dakṣa II. 43 and Yāj. I, 100). Those who bathe twice (in the morning and at noon) will strictly follow the routine sketched above in Dakṣa, Yāj. and others. But most of the brāhmaṇas bathe only once either in the morning or before noon. The principal matters to be described</p>
<p>in connection with the bath before noon are tarpana of gods, sages and pitrs; devapūjd and the five daily yajñas. These will now be desoribed in detail.</p>
<p>Tarpana-(satiating by offering water). As stated in Manu II. 176, every day one has to perform tarpapa of gods, sages and pitss. The water to be offered to gods is poured by that part of the right hand which is called devatirtha and that for the pitra by the pitr-tirtha. A person was to perform tarpana according to the gshyasūtra of the Vedio sākhā which he or bis ancestors studied. There is a good deal of divergence among the several grb yasūtras.

<p>by the Asv. gr. (III. 4. 1-5 ) will be first set out. In the Devatātarpana the following deities are enumerated and one has to add the words ' typyatu&rsquo;, &lsquo;trpyetām&rsquo;, or trpyantu&rsquo; with each devatā according as it is one deity, two deities or more and offer water to each (e. g. &lsquo;Prajāpatis-tṛpyatu, Brabmā tṛpyatu, &hellip;&hellip; Dgāvāppthivi tṛpyetām&rsquo; &amp;c.). The deities are 31 viz. Prajapati, Brahma, Vedas, devas, psis, all metres, omkara, vaṣatkāra, vyābstis, the Gayatri, sacrifices (yajñas ), heaven and earth, the air (antarikṣa ), days and nights, the Sāṅkhyas, siddhas, oceans, the rivers, the mountains, the fields, herbs, trees, Gandharvas and Apsarases, snakes, birds, cows, sādhyas, vipras, yakṣas, the rakṣases, the bhūtas (beings) that have these (raksas) at the end. In modern times the fields, herbs, trees, Gandharvas and Apsarases are put in one compound word and form only one devatā, while after bhūtas there is a separate deity &lsquo;evam-antāni trpyantu&rsquo;. Haradatta on Aśv. gr. III. 3. 2 refers to the view of some that take &lsquo;evam-antāni&rsquo; as a separate mantra but his opinion was that the phrase &lsquo;evam-antāni&rsquo; only described the preceding devatās and that the devatās stopped at &lsquo;raksāmsi&rsquo;. He further adds that the tarpaṇa to these was done by the prājāpatya tirtha (of the hand).</p>
<p>The sages to whom water is offered are divided into two groups. The first group contains twelve sages and when offer ing water to these the sacred thread is worn in the nivita form. The twelve sages are those of the hundred rks, the middle fsis (i. e. of mandalas 2 to 9 of the Rgveda), Gștsamada, Visvāmitra, Vamadeva, Atri, Bharadvāja, Vasiṣtha, Pragātbas, the Pavamāni hymns, sages of the short hymns and those of the long hymns (the tarpane formula will be sataroinas-trpyantu, madhyamas-trpyantu, Gștsamadas-trpyantu &amp;c.). It will be noticed that the sages from Gṛtsamada to Vasiṣtba are the seers of mandalas 2 to 7 of the Rgveda. The Pragathas stand for the eighth mandala of which the first hymn is ascribed in the Anukramani to Pragatha of the Kaṇva gotia and the rest of the eighth mandala is ascribed to various scions of the Kanya gotra. The verses of the ninth mandala are called Pāvamānyaḥ; but as it is a tarpaṇa of sages, we rather expect the form pāve mānāḥ as in the Saṅkhyāyana grhya IV, 10. &lsquo;Sataroinab&rsquo; refers to the gages of the first mandala, and &ldquo;kṣudrasūktāḥ&rdquo; and &lsquo;mahāsūktab&rsquo; to sages of the tenth mandala. Water is offered to these sages by the daiva tirtha. Then there is a second group of sages to whom water is offered by a person who wears his sacred</p>

<p>Ahnika-tarpaṇa</p>

<p>thread in the prācināvita form (i. e. it is suspended over the right shoulder and under the left arm). There are two sub-groups bere. In the first the verbal forms &lsquo;trpyantu&rsquo;or&rsquo; trpyatu' are used with the nominative of the words for the sage; i. e. &lsquo;Sumantu Jaimini-Vaisampāyana-Paila-sūtra-bhāṣya-Bharata-Mahabhā. rata-Dharmācāryās trpyantu&rsquo;;1655 * Jānanti-Bābavi.Gārgya-Gau tama-Sākalya-Bābhravya-Māndavya-Mapdūkeyās tṛpyantu &lsquo;;</p>
<p>Gārgi-Vāoaknavi trpyatu, Vadava-Pratitheyi tṛpyatu, Sula bhā-Maitreyi tṛpyatu&rsquo;. These together are five sentences. It is remarkable that in this list three women are mentioned as sages (Gārgi, Vadavā and Sulabhā ). Among the other søges the first four are frequently mentioned in the Mahābhārata as the pupils of Vyāsa who taught them the Vedas ( vide Sabhāparva 4. 11 and Sānti 328. 26-27 where all four are named). For chronological purposes it is important to note that the Asv. gr. knew teachers of sūtras, bhāṣyas, of the Bhārata and also the Mahabharata and of Dharma. In the Becond sub-group there are 17 single sages and the 18th is a miscellaneous offering to all other acāryas. The names of the 17 sages ocour in the accusative and after each the word *tarpayāmi' is to be uttered ( i. e. Kaholam tarpayāmi, Kausi takan tarpayāmi&hellip;&hellip; Abvalāyanam tarpayāmi). These 17 Bages are: Kahoļa, Kauṣitaka, Mabākausitaka, Paingya, Mahāpaingya, Suyajña, Saṅkhyāyana, Aitareya, Maha itareya, Sakala, Baṣkala, Sujātavaktra, Auda vāhi, Mahaude vāhi, Saujāmi, Saunaka, Asvalayana. The 18th is may all the other acāryas be satiated' (ye canye acāryās-te sarve tṛpyantu ). All these sages are connected with the Rgveda, its Brāhmaṇas, its Aranyakas and other related works like the Prātisakhya sutra ( of which Saunaka is said to be the author). It is interesting to note that Asvalāyana himself is named as the last teacher in tarpana. Saunaka is said to be the teacher of Aśvaldyana.658 In modern times in the Deocan water is offered twice to each sage or group of sages.</p>

<p>Brahmayajña of which tarpapa is a constituent part). In modern times the deceased ancestors and relatives to whom water is offered are stated below. Water is offered to each thrice (except to women ancestors other than the mother, grand-mother and the great-grandmother) by the pitr-tirtha and the rele tionship, the gotra and the name of each are recited when doing so. For example, water is offered to the deceased father in the form, &lsquo;I offer svadba and bow to and satiate my father, 80 and so by name, whose gotra was so and so and who has attained the form of Vasu&rsquo; (asmatpitaram amukaśarmāṇam amuka-gotram vagurūpam svadhanamas tarpayāmi). The ances tors and relatives to whom water is offered, if they are dead, are in order father, paternal grandfather and great-grandfather ; mother, paternal grand-mother and great-grandmother; step mother; maternal grand-father (with maternal grand-mother, sapatnikam being used with #mātāmaham'), maternal great grand-father and maternal great-great-grand-father (with their wives); one&rsquo;s wife; one&rsquo;s son (or sons, if several are dead already and with his wife or their wives that are dead); daughter (with her husband, if both are dead); upole (with his wife, if dead); maternal uncle (with his wife, if dead); brother (with wife); paternal aunt (with husband); maternal aunt (with husband ); sister ( with husband); father-in-law (with his wife and son, if they are dead); guru (father as teacher of the Gayatri and Veda); pupil. In the case of grand-fathers and grand-mothers they are described as &ldquo;rudrarūpa&rsquo;aud the great grand-fathers and great-grand-mothers as &lsquo;adityarūpa&rsquo;. The three ancestors of the mother with their wives are respectively Vasurūpa, rudrarūpa and adityarūpa 167. The names of women ancestors bave the affix &lsquo;da&rsquo; added and all persons both male and female other than those specified above are described as</p>
<p>Vasurupa',</p>
<p>A few points of divergence will be noticed. Haradatta on Asv. gr. III. 3. 6 notes that some do not include the mother and maternal relations in the daily tarpana, and that according to the establisbed practice in his day the tarpaṇa formulæ did not Include the names and the gotra of the relatives.

<p>do not say that the names and gotras of the relatives are to be repeated in daily tarpana. The words &lsquo;svadba namas&rsquo; do not occur in many sūtras, but some do contain them (e.g. Baud. Db. 8. II, 5, 184 ff.. Vaik. 1.4). The devatās of tarpaṇa differ in each sutra. The Sān. gr.(IV.9) whioh belongs to the Rgveda just as Asvalāyana&rsquo;s does, enumerates the deities differently in the beginning (it has Agni, Vāyu, Sūrya, Viṣṇu, Prajāpati, Virūpākṣa, Sahasrāksa &amp;c.). Its order of sages is somewhat different and it adds some names such as Sakapūni, Gautami &amp;c. The Baud. Dh. S. II. 5 contains the most elaborate tarpaṇa of all sūtras, It puts om&rsquo; before each devatā, rṣi and pits. It includes not only many more deities than elsewhere, but includes several names of the same deity. (e. g. Vināyaka, Vakratunda, Hasti. mukba, Ekadanta ; Yama, Yamarāja, Dharma, Dharmaraja, Kala, Nila, Vaivasvata &amp;o.). Among rṣis it inoludes many sūtrakāras like Kaṇva, Baudhayana, Apastamba, Satyāṣādha, and also Yājñavalkya, Vyāsa. The Hir, gr. II. 19, 20, Baud. gr. III. 9, Bhāradvāja gr. III. 9-11 contain long and interesting lists of deities and particularly of sages.</p>
<p>If a man has no time for this lengthy tarpaṇa the Dharma sindhu and other digests prescribe an extremely brief one, viz. he repeate two verses and offers water thrice. The verses are &lsquo;may the gods, sages, pitṛs, human beings, from Brahmā up to a blade of grass, be satiated and also all the pitre, the mother and the maternal grand-father and the rest, may this water mixed with sesame be for the crores of families of bygone ages residing in the seven dvipas from the world of Brahma downwards &lsquo;.</p>
<p>The Snānasātra (3rd kandika ) of Katyāyana attached to the Pār. gs. contains a description of tarpana. Like the Baud. Db. S. it lays down that &lsquo;om&rsquo; is to be uttered before the name of every deity (devata ) and &lsquo;tṛpyatām&rsquo; (or trpyantām if the word denoting the deity is in the plural) is the verbal form employed. The deities are only 28 and slightly differ from those of Aśv. The group of sages is made up of only Sanaka, Sanandana, Santana, Kapila, Asuri, Vodbu, and Pancaśikha (Kapila, Asuri and Pancaśikha are according to the Saṅkhya karika the names of the founders of the Saṅkhya philosophy and stand in the rolation of teacher and pupil). Then (after the røitarpaṇa), the householder is to mir sesame in water and wear the sacred tbread under the left arm and suspend it from the right shoulder&rsquo; and offer the water to Kavyavād Anala</p>

<p>(fire), Soma, Yama, Aryaman, Agniṣvāttas, Somapas, Barbi. sads 1688 Offerings of water mixed with sesame are to be made thrice to each of the above with joined hands (jalāñjali) and this is to be done by all householders even if the father be living. The remaining part of tar paṇa (viz. pitrtarpaṇa ) is to be done only by him whose father is dead. Gobhila-smrti II. 18-20, Matsyapurāpa 102. 14-21 are very similar to the Snāns sutra. According to Asvalāyana and others water is offered with the right hand only while according to Kātyāyana and others water is offered with both hands. 1689 The Sm, C. I. p.191 says that the householder should follow his grhyasūtra and if there is nothing in it on this point there is an option. Kārṣnājini pre scribes that in srāddha and marriage only the right hand is employed in making an offering or gift, but in tarpaṇa both hands (made into an añjali) are employed. One 1660 añjali of water is offered to each of the gods, two to Sanaka and other sages and three to each of the pitrs. When tarpana is performed while the householder is still in the water with his wet clothes on, ho offers the water in the stream itself; but when he wears dry clothes and performs tarpaṇa, then he is to let fall the handfuls of water in a pure veggel of gold, silver, copper, bronze, but not in an earthen one; or he may let the water fall on the ground covered with kusas (Sm. C. I. p. 192 ). There were several views on this point (vide Gș. R. pp. 263-264). In modern times daily tarpana bas become very rare. Only a few even among the orthodox or priestly brāhmaṇas and among those who have studied the several sāstras (such as grammar</p>

<p>A special tarpana was offered to Yama on the 14th of the dark half of a month if it was a Tuesday or on the 14th of the dark half. Vide Sm. O. I. pp. 197-198, Madana pārijāta p. 296, Par. M. I. part 1, p. 361. Dakṣa (II. 52-55 ) prescribes that Yama-tarpaṇs is specially performed in the Jumna on the days specified above and gives the several names under which Yama is invoked. Vide also Matsyapurāṇa 213. 2-8. The Tai. Ar. VI. 5 speaks of a yajña or bali ( offering) in honour of Yama every month. There is also tarpana in honour of the great epio hero Bhiṣma offered on the 8th of the bright half of Magha. Vide Sm. O. I. p. 198.</p>
<p>Gobhila-smṛti 1881 (II. 22-23) emphasizes the importance of tarpaṇa by remarking that, as all beings, animate or inani mate, desire water from the brāhmaṇa who brings prosperity to all, tarpapa should always be done by him and that if he does not do it he would inour great sin and that if he does it he would support this world. The idea underlying tarpana seems to be indicated even by the Tai. S. V. 4. 4. 1. 1668</p>
<p>It has already been seen (at pp. 668-669 ) that tarpana was presoribed as an appendage of the early morning bath and that some required it to be done twice daily while others said that it was to be done only once. As Aśv.gr. places tarpana immediately after svādbyāya (or brahmayajña) it follows that he treated it as a constituent though subordinate part of it. The Gobhilasmrti (II. 29 ) says that brahmayajña which consists in inaudibly muttering Vedio texts (japa) should be performed before tarpaṇa or after the morning homa or at the end of Vaiśvadeva and at no other time unless there is some special reason. 1863</p>

<p>PAÑCA MAHĀYAJÑAS</p>
<p>Pañca Mahājajñas :-(the five daily great observances or sacrifices).</p>
<p>From early Vedio times five daily observances called mahāyajñas were presoribed. The Sat. Br. (XI. 5. 6. I.) 1864 says &lsquo;there are only five mahāyajñas, they are like great sacrificial sessions, viz. the sacrifice to beings, the sacrifice to men, the sacrifice to the Fathers, the sacrifice to the gods, the sacrifice to brahman (Veda)&rsquo;. These are then briefly defined. In the Tsi.</p>
<p>Ar. II. 10 we read these five mahāyajinas indeed are spread out continuously, viz. devayajña, pitryajña, bbūtayajña, manusy&amp; yajña, brahmayajña. That is fulblled as devayajña when one</p>
<p>makes an offering in fire, even if it be a mere fuel-stick; when one offers svadha (sraddha repast) to the fathers, even if it be mere water, that becomes pitryajña; when &amp; man offers a bali (a ball of food) to the beings it becomes bhutayajna, when he gives food to brāhmaṇas that becomes manuṣyayajña. When one studies svādhyāya even if it be a single ;k or yajus formula or a sūman, it becoines brahmayajña&rsquo;. 1665</p>
<p>The Asv. gr. (III 1. 1-4) speaks of the five mahayajnas and defines them in practically the same words as the Tai. Ār. IL 10 and enjoins that those yajñas must be performed every. day. Narayara on Asv. gr. III. 1.2 expressly asserts that the</p>

Ar, II. 10 ) * great yajñas&rsquo; and &lsquo;great sacrifioial sessions&rsquo; by way of lauda tion. The word' yajña ' applied to these five daily duties is figurative and the adjective' great' is applied only for belaud ing 1867 them. Gaut. V.8 and VIII. 17, Baud. Dh, S. II. 6.1-8, Gobbilasmpti II. 26 and numerous smrti texts speak of the same five yajñas. Gaut. VIII. 17 inoludes them among sarskāras as stated above (p. 193 ).</p>
<p>It will be noticed from the description of the five yajñas given below that they are distinguished from the solemn srauta saorifices in two respects. In these five the chief agent is the householder bimself, he does not need the help and ministration of a professional priest, while in the srauta sacrifices the priests occupy the most prominent place and the householder is more or less a passive spectator or agent in the hands of the priests who direct everything. In the second place, in the five yajñas the central point is the discharge of duties to the Creator, to the ancient sages, to the Manes, and to the whole universe with myriads of creatures of various grades of intelligence. In the srauta sacrifices the main-spring of action is the desire to secure Heaven or some object such as prosperity, a son &amp;c. Therefore the institution of the five sacrifices is morally and spiritually more progressive and more ennobling than that of the frauta sacrifices.</p>
<p>The sentiments that prompted the performance of these five observances appear to have been as follows: Every man could not afford to celebrate the solemn srauta rites prescribed in the Brābmaṇas and Srauta sūtras. But every one could offer a fuel-stiok to fire that was deemed to be the mouth of the</p>

<p>great Gods 1868 of Heaven and thus show his reverence and devotion to them. Similarly everyone could show his reverence for and gratitude to the great sages that had bequeathed a glorious heritage of sacred literature by repeating at least one verse and one could propitiate his deceased ancestors by offering in loving memory and filial devotion a mere handful or vessel-ful of water (which costs nothing). The whole world human and non-human is one creation and there must be a spirit of live and let live or give and take. Therefore one must offer what one can afford to a guest and also have something for all beings (including even such shunned animals as dogs, crows and insects). These feelings of devotion, gratitude, reverence, loving memory, kindliness and tolerance seem to have been the springs that prompted the Aryans of old to emphasize the importance of the five daily yajñas and to have led sutra writers like Gautama and legislators like Manu (IL. 28) to look upon them as saṇskāras, 88 ennobling the soul by freeing it from mere selfishness and elevating the body to become a fit vehicle for higher things. 1069 Later on it appears that other purposes came to be attributed to the institution of the five daily yajñas. According to Manu III. 68-71, Viṣnu Dh. 8. 59. 19-20, Saṅkha V. 1-2, Harita, Matsyapurīna 52. 15-16 and others every householder causes injury or death to sentient beings every day in five places, viz. the hearth, the grinding mill, broomstick, winnowing basket and similar household gear, mortar and pestle, and water-jar. The five daily yajñas were dovised by the great søges as atonements for the sins arising from these five sources of injury to life. These five are : brah mayajña which oonsists in the study and teaching of the Veda, pitryajña which consists of tarpana, daivayajña which consists in offerings made into fire, bhūtayajña which is offering obla tions to beings and manuṣyayajña which consists in honouring guests. He who performs these daily according to his means is never tainted by the sin of the injuries arising from the five places mentioned above. Manu (III. 73–74) further 1070 saya that former søges had a different nomenclature for the five</p>

<p>yajñas i. e. ahuta, huta, prahuta, brāhmya-huta and prūsita, which were the same respectively as japs (or brahmayajña ), homa (devayajña), bhūtayajña, manusyayajña and pitstarpaṇa (pitryajña). In the Atharvayeda VI. 71. % four out of these seem to be alluded to &lsquo;what came to me as huta or ahuta or given by pitṛs and assented to by men&rsquo;. 1871 Huta and prahuta in the sense of homa to gods and bali to bhūtas ocour in Br. Up. I. 5.2. But in some gļhyasūtras different meanings are attached to these very words e. g. Sān. gr. I. 5 and Par. gf. I. 4 say that there are four pākayajñas viz. buta, ahuta, prahuta and prāśita and San. gṛ. I. 10.7 1072 explains that they are respectively the same as agnihotra ( or daivayajña), bali (bhūtayajña), pits yajña and brāhmya-buta (or mānuṣyayajba ). The Hārlta. dharma-sutra has a very interesting passage on this point. &lsquo;We shall now explain the sūnās (places of injury) which are so called because they kill moving and immovable sentient beings. They are five. The first (sūnā) is caused by actions like sudden entrance in water, plunging into water, whirling water, splashing it in various directions, taking water without straining it through a piece of cloth and driving vehicles; the second by walking about in the dark or &amp;way from the beaten path or in quick jerks or by treading upon insects &amp;c.; the third by striking ( a tree with an axe &amp;o.), by pluoking flowers &amp;c., by tying with a rope &amp;o., by crushing (in &amp; mortar), by splitting (wood &amp;c.); the fourth by cutting crops, by rubbing or grinding; and the fifth by ignition of fire-wood ), heating (of water ), by roasting, frying and cooking. These five injuries that lead to Hell are committed every day by people. Brahma carins get rid of the first three by attending on fire and on their teacher and by the study of the Veda ; householders and forest hermits purify themselves from these five by performing the five yajñas; ascetios get rid of the first two injuries by sacred knowledge and contemplation, but the injury caused by crushing uncooked seeds under the teeth cannot be removed by any of these &lsquo;. 1073 Although in the Ap. Dh. S. end others the five yajñas are enumerated in the order of bhūta-yajña, manusya-yajña,</p>

<p>devayajña, pitsyajña and svādhyāya, still the proper order from the point of view of the times of performance is first brahmayajña (japa &amp;o.), then devayajña, then bhūtayajña, then pitȚyajia, and lastly manusyayajña. 1074 Therefore they will be dealt with in the same order bere. But some matters have first to be noted. Various views were entertained about the time and nature of brahmayajña 1075 and pitsyajña. According to Gobhila-smrti II. 28-29 quoted above (n. 1663), japa prescribed in samdbyā adoration may be looked upon as brahmayajña, that the latter may be performed before tarpans and after the morning homa or after vaiśvadeva. Nārāyana on Aśv. gr. III. 2. 1 says that brahmayajña may be performed before or after vaisvadeva. Aocording to the Snānasūtra of Katyāyana, brahmayajāe precedes tarpana and Asv. gļ. as stated above (p. 695 ) appears to regard tarpaña as part of it. Manu III. 82 ( Viṣnu Dh. S. 67. 23-25) enjoins upon a man the performance of daily śrāddha with food or water or with milk, roots and fruits and thus to propi tiate and please the Manes of his deceased ancestors; while Manu ( III. 70 and 283 ) says that tarpana ( done after bath ) constitutes pitsyajña. Therefore Gobhila says that śrāddha, tarpana and the bali offered to pitrs constitute pitryajña and even when one of them is gone through, the performance of pitryajña is effected and it is not necessary to perform all three. 1078 In the bali-harana ( described below ) the remnants of bali are offered to pitṛs ( Aśv. gr. I. 2. 11, Manu III. 91 ).</p>
<p>Brahma-yajña. Probably the earliest description of this is to be found in the Sat. Br. XI.5.6.3-8. That Brāhmaṇa, after stating that brahmayajma is one&rsquo;s own daily study of the Veda, compares several elements required in the ordinary sacrifice to certain elements of brahmayajña, viz. the juhū spoon, upabhrt, dhruva, Bruve, avabhrtha (the solemn bath at the end of a sacrifice ) and heaven are said to be represented by the speech, the mind, the eye, mental power, truth and the conclusion (that</p>

Then 4-7 compare șk, yajus, sāman and Atharvangiras (Atharvaveda ) texts respectively to offerings to gods of milk, ghee, soma and fat and it is stated that the gods being delighted and satisfied with these, bestow on the man who per forms brahmayajña affluence and seourity, life-breath, seed, his whole self and all auspicious blessings and streams of ghee and honey flow for his departed pitrs. The Sat. Br. XI. 5. 6. 8 enumerates other works that may be recited in brahmayajña, the recital of which is like honey offerings to gods who being delighted and gratified bestow on the reciter the boons stated above, the works being Anuśāsanas ( Vedāngas ), vidyās ( such 88 sarps and devajana vidya mentioned in Chandogya VII. 1. 1), vākovākya ( theological discourses called brahmodya, as in Vaj. S. 23. 9-12 and 45-62 ), Itihāgapurana (traditional history and legends ), Gāthās, Nārāśaṁsis (i, e. stanzas in praise of heroes ). 1878 The Tai. Ār. (II. 10-13) has a more lengthy passage on brahmayajña ; Tai. Ār. II. 10 is almost 1878 the same as Sat. Br. except in two respeots, viz. in the Tai. Ār. Athar Vāngirasaḥ are said to be honey offerings and brāhmana texts, itihāsas, purānas, kalpas ( works on srauta ritual) and Gātha Nārāsamsis are said to be fat offerings and the rewards, bestowed by the gods when delighted by the brahmayajña, are long life, brilliance, lustre, prosperity, glory, spiritual eminence and food. Tai. Ār. II. 11 describes how and where brahmayajña is to be performed&rsquo; one who desires to offer brahmayajña should repair to a place so far away to the east, north or north-east of his village that the thatoh covering houses is not visible and when the sun rises ho should wear his sacred thread (in the upavita form ) under his right arm, should sit down (on a pure spot ), should wash both his hands with water, should sip water thrice, should wipe his hand twice with water, should</p>

<p>once sprinkle his lips with water, and touch his head, eyes, nostrils, ears and heart; he should spread out &amp; large seat of darbhas, should be seated facing the east with his legs crossed over each other (the left foot being underneath and the right foot on the left thigh ) and then should repeat his Veda ; ( it is Baid that) the darbhas are indeed the flavour (or sweetness ) of waters and herbs; he (by sitting on darbhas) makes his Veda full of sweetness. Placing his left hand on the right knee with the palm turned up and covering it with the right hand the palm of which is turned down and placing pavitras (blades of darbha) bet ween both hands, he should begin with the syllable &lsquo;om&rsquo; which is &amp; yajus, which is the representative of the three Vedas, which is all speech, and is the highest syllable; this has been declared by a rk ( Rg, I. 164. 39 is quoted ). He recites the syllables bhūḥ, bhuvah, syaḥ; he thereby (by repeating the vyābṛtis ) employs the thres Vedas. This is the truth ( quintessence) of speech; he thereby has employed the truth of speech. Then he recites thrice the Gāyatri verse, which is addressed to Savitr, by its feet separately, then by half of it, then the whole verse without stopping. The sun is the creator of glory, be secures glory itself; then he begins ( the next day ) the repetition of the Vedic texts from that point which he had noted ( the previous day ). 1880 Tai. Ar. II. 12 states that if a man is unable to go out of the village he may perform brahmyajña by revolving in his mind in the village itself the Veda by day or even by night; or if he cannot seat himself, then he may perform the brahma yajña even standing or lying down, since the principal matter is the recitation of the Veda ( time and place being quite subordinate). Tai. Ār. II. 13 says that he should conolude the brahmayajña by repeating thrice the verse Adoration to Brahma ( Veda or Prajāpati), to Agni, to the Earth, to herbs, to speech, to the Lord of speech (Bphaspati), I offer adoration to</p>

<li>The idea is that one is not to begin to recite Vedic texts at random. When a man has recited a portion of any Veda one day, ho should note where he stopped and continuo his recitation next day from that point. The Ap. Dh. 8. 1. 3. 11. 19 also prescribes that one should go every day to the water-side before taking his morning meal and recito in &amp; puro place a portion of the Veda in succession (i. .. one day he should begia where he stopped the previous day and so on) Vide Xóv. gr.

<p>the great Vlonu&rsquo;. 1181 Then he should sip water and return home; thereafter whatever he gives becomes the fee of the Bacrifice ( i. e. of brahmayajña ).</p>
<p>The procedure of svadbyāya ( or brahmayajña) in Asv. gr. III. 2. 2-III. 3. 4 is practically in the same words as in the Tai. Ār. quoted above. One or two points may be noted. The Asv. gr. 1688 prescribes that one should recite gazing at the horizon or one may close one&rsquo;s eyes or one may look in such a way that one feels that one can concentrate one&rsquo;s mind. According to the Asv. gr. the shortest brahmayajña would be : om bhūr bhu vaḥ svaḥ; the Gāyatri verse repeated thrice; then at least one Ik verse and then the verse &lsquo;namo brahmane&rsquo; (quoted above) repeated thrice. The Ahnikaprakasa p. 329 says that one who knows only a portion of the Veda should recite as brahmayajna the Puruṣasūkta ( Rg. X. 90) and other hymns and one who knows only the Gayatri should repeat &lsquo;om&rsquo; as brahmayajña every day. 1883 Aśv. gs. (III. 3. 1) mentions the following works for svādhyāya, Rgveda, Yajurveda, Sameveda, Atharvan. girasaḥ, Brāhmaṇas, Kalpas, Gatbas Nārāśamsis, Itihāsas, and Purāṇas. But it adds that one may recite only as much as one feels that one can afford to do with a concentrated mind.</p>
<p>The Sān. gr. I. 4 prescribes several hymns and verses of the Rgveda for reciting in brahmayajaa. Others following different Vedas and Sakhas differ as to the content of the brahmayajña. Vide Abnika-prakāśa pp. 328-336 for brahmayajña according to Kātyāy&amp;pa and according to the followers of Sāmaveda. Yāj. I. 101 prescribes that as time and ability allow one may include in brahmayajña the Vedas together with the Atharva veda, Itihasa and philosophical texts.</p>
<p>Brahmayajña is very rarely performed every day (except by the most orthodox vaidikas and śāstris ) in modern times and a fixed formula of brahmayajña has been decided upon, which is recited once a year in Srāvana by most brāhmaṇas in the Deccan. The formula for students of the Rgveda is as follows:</p>

<p>After reciting &lsquo;om bhūr bhuvaḥ svah&rsquo; and the sacred Gayatri, he recites Rg. 1.1.1-9, then the first sentence of the Ait. Br., the first sentences of the five sections of the Ait. Ār.; the first sentences of the Black and White Yajurveda, of the Samaveda, of the Atharva veda; the first sentences of the Nighantu and the six Vedangas viz. Aśv. śrauta, Nirukta, Chandas, Nighapṭu, Jyotiṇa, Sikṣa, Pāṇini&rsquo;s grammar in order; the first &lsquo;pada&rsquo; of Yāj. I. 1 and of the Mahabharata (I.1.1), the first sūtra of the Nyāya, Pūrvainimaṁsā and Uttaramlmārsā; then a benedictory formula (stacchamyor&hellip; catuṣpade&rsquo;) and lastly the verse&rsquo; namo brahmaṇe' is repeated thrice.1084 After this brahmayajña, tarpaṇa of devas, sages and pitsa follows.</p>
<p>The Dharmasindhu (III. pūrvārdha p. 299 ) says that brahmayojña is to be performed once either after morning homa or after midday saṁdhyā or after Vaisvadeva, but those who study the Asvaldyanasūtra should perform it only after midday sandhyā. After ācamana and prānāyāma one should make the samnkalpa ( $riparameśvaraprItyartham brabmayajñam kariṣye tadangataya devarsy&amp;cārya-tarpaṇam kariṣye) and if one&rsquo;s father is dead one should add in the samkalpa ( pitstarpapam ca kariṣye ). It then sets out how it is to be performed by various people, such as those who have studied all vedas or one veda or only a portion or when one has no time. It says that the followers of the Taittiriya sakbā repeat the wordsvidyud-asi vidya me pāpmānam-ṣtat satyan-upaimi' at the commence ment and the words &lsquo;vrstirasi ypsoa me pāpmānan-stāt satyam. upāgim&rsquo; at the end. If a man is unable to repeat brahmayajña sitting he may do it even when lying down.</p>
<p>The Dharmasindhu notes that according to the followers of the Tahririya gakha and of the Vājasaneya Samhita tarpana is not a part of brahmayajña and so tarpans hay be performed by them either before brahmayajña or even some time after brahmayajña.</p>
