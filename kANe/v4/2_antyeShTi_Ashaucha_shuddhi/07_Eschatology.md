CHAPTER VII

ESCHATOLOGY

What happens after death to a human being (which is the subject matter of Eschatology) has been a great mystery that has intrigued and baffled mankind in all ages and was a question of vital importance among almost all ancient peoples such as the Indians, Egyptians, Chaldeans, Greeks and Persians. The word Eschatology is derived from a Greek term meaning 'last things and is applied to the study of opinions that men have held from time to time concerning the future, including such matters as the state of man after life on this earth and the end of the world. It exercises a great fascination over most people and speculation on it can be carried on endlessly. Every religion has its own eschatology. There are two aspects of Eschatology; one is concerned with the destiny of the individual after death, immortality of the soul, sin and punishment, the meaning and content of 'Heaven' and 'Hell'; the other aspect of eschatology has relation to the whole universe, its creation, destination and renovation, and the ultimate end of all things. The first aspect and matters relevant to it from the ancient Indian point of view will be dealt with in this section and the second aspect of Eschatology is reserved for treatment in a later section. In ancient works far more emphasis was laid on the first than on the second, while modern men with a more or less scientific outlook and attitude are inclined to think more of the second aspect.

Death has been generally looked upon with feelings of awe and terror, though there were men (often philosophically minded) who looked upon it as a blessing and as a release of the spirit from the shackles imposed upon the latter by the body. The terror of death was in many cases due not so much to the pain caused at the time of death but rather to the mystery that surrounds what happens after death and to the thoughts about what the survivors would have to undergo. It is said by O E. Vulliamy in his work 'Immortal man' (p. 2): ‘although the idea of that life (ghostly life) ranges from the most dismal and horrible fantasies to the most sublime imaginations, the fundamental thought is always the same, the body dies but not the spirit'. There were several attitudes adopted by primitive as well as civilized people towards death. In the Kathŏpaniṣad we read (I. 1.20 ) When a man dies there is a doubt, some saying that there is survival after the death of the body and some denying any survival' and Naciketas requests the dreaded God Yama to solve this doubt. There are several beliefs[^422a] even among those who hold that there is survival after death. Some say that there is a world of the dead to which whatever survives goes after death. Others believe that the surviving part goes to Heaven or Hell according as the man has been virtuous or sinful in his life on earth. Others believe in transmigration and re-incarnation, Several of the great writers in ancient Greece believed in this last doctrine, as Pindar (in second Olympian Ode), Plato (in Phaedrus and Timaeus) and Herodotus (II. 123) indicate.

The Brahmapurāna (chap. 214 verses 34–39) sets out the Persons to whom death is happy and easy and not a source of misery and sorrow. A few may be mentioned here.-'He who did not tell lies, he who did not prove false to affection or friendship, who is an _āstıka_ (a believer in God and the life to come), who is devoted to the worship of gods and the honouring of brāhmanas, ha who does not bear malice to anyone-these have a happy death,' Similarly, the Anusāsanaparva of the Mahābhārata (chap. 104. 11-12, chap. 144 49-60) states at length the causes of premature death and of long life. Some of them may be translated here. Those who are atheists, do not perform the acts (or sacrifices) proper for them, violate the (dictates of) elders and of sāstras, who do not know what _dharma_ is and are evil-doers are short-lived. Those who have no character, who always break all rules of conduct, who have promiscuous sexual intercourse become short-lived and go to Hell. One who is not irritable by temper, speaks the truth, does not cause injury to beings, who bears no malice to any one and who is not crooked—those live for a hundred years' (104. 11-12 and 14).

## _Signs of approaching death_

Several works specify the signs indicative of the approach of death. The Śantiparva of the Mahābhārata (chap. 318. 9-17), Devala quoted in the Moksakānda of the Kalpataru (pp. 248-250, about 20 verges), the Vāyupurāṇa (chap. 19 verses 1~32), the Mārkandeyapurāna 43. 1-33 (chap. 40 verses 1-33, Venkatesvara Press ed.), Lingapurāna (pūrvārdha chap. 91) and other Purāṇas contain long lists of the signs of approaching death. It is impossible for want of space to set out in detail these signs. But the gist of a few verses is mentioned by way of sample. The Sāntiparva (chap 318) states that a man who is not able to see the star of Arundhatī which he could formerly see, nor the pole-star nor the full moon, nor his own reflection in another man's eye has only one year to live; he has only a span of six months of life left to him who sees the orb of the moon with a hole in it; a man has only seven days left of life who sees a hole pierced in the orb of the Sun, who smells the odour of a corpse when fragrant substances are near; when the nose and ears bend down, when his teeth and eyes become discoloured, when there is loss of consciousness, and loss of bodily heat, when smoke emerges from the crown of the head, when the left eye begins to ooze moisture all of a sudden these are indications of the immediate approach of death. Devala states indications that prognosticate life for only one year, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2 months, one month, half a month, 12 days, 4 days, 3 days, 2 days and winds up by saying that one who cannot hear the humming sound in his ear (when closed with fingers) or cannot see the light in the eye is going to die immediately. The Vāyupuraṇa (19.28) and Lingapurāṇa 91.30 regard the last two as the worst indications of approaching death[^433]. The Lingapurāṇa (pūrvabhāga chap. 91.24) states that he who cannot see his own reflection in another's eye will not live. There is an interesting paper by Dr R.G. Harshe in the Munshi Diamond Jubilee volume (pp. 246-268) where the learned writer gives the text of two mss. on the prognostications derived from dreams e.g. if a man sees an ass in a dream he is sure to die, or if he sees an old maid then it is an indication of danger, disease and death (p. 251) or if he sees a trident death is indicated (p. 254).

[^423]:  ई चात्र परमेऽरिष्टे एत्तद्रूपं परं भवेत्। घोपं न शृणुयात्कर्णे ज्योतिनैत्रे न पश्यति ॥ वायुपुराण 19.27; वशं वा श्रमणं दृष्ट्वा विघात्मृत्युमुपस्थितन्। लिङ्ग्पुराण (पूर्वभाग 91 19).

When a man is sinking and is almost on the point of death it was and even now is the practice in many parts of India to take the dying man down from the bedstead and place him on & bed spread on the earth[^424]. For example, the Kauśika-sūtra (803) prescribes[^425] : When the man is losing all strength, he (the son or other attending relative) spreads _kuśas_ on the grass growing in the shed and takes him down (from the bed-stead) with the _mantra_ 'syonāsmai bhava' (mayst thou be good to this man, Oh Earth). The Baud P S III 1 18 says that sand should be spread on the ground in the sacrificial shed when it is feared that the sacrificer is dying and _darbha_ grass should be strewn on the sand with the sharp ends turned to the south and the dying man should be placed thereon and one (son or the like) should repeat in his right ear the _anuvāka_ beginning with 'āyusah prānam santanu'. The Gobhilasmrti III. 22 and later works lika the pitṛdayitā provide the same procedure.

Medieval digests like the Śuddhiprakāśa (pp 151–152) state that when a person is moribund, has half closed his eyes and is taken down on the ground (from a bed-stead), his son or other relative should make him give one or more of ten gifts viz of cows, [^426] land, sesame, gold, clarified butter, clothes, grain, jaggery, silver, salt. These gifts are superior even to a śrāddha performed at Gayā or to even hundreds of Aśvamedhas.

[^424]: In Europe a very widespread custom is to take a dying man out of bed and to lay him on the earth or on straw. Vide Prof Edgerton's very exhaustive article on 'the Hour of Death' in Annals of the Bhandarkar O.R, Jostulote, vol. VIII PP 219-249.

## Gifts when death approaches



The _saṅkalpa_ (verbal declaration of the gift) is made in the words 'I shall make ten gifts for the attainment of heaven (_abhyudaya_), or for the removal of all sins'. After the ten _dānas_, a cow with & calf should be donated if possible[^427] (this cow being called _utkrānti-dhenu_ "a cow donated in view of death') and then another cow called Vaitaranī with gold (or two pieces of cloth &c) should be donated. The Antyestipaddhati and the Śuddhiprakāśa (pp. 152-153) set out all the mantras (not vedic) that are to be recited at the time of making the several gifts, which (mantras) are passed over here for want of space. The Antyestipaddhati, the Antyakarmadīpaka and other works prescribe that when a person is near death, his son or other relative should make him perform Vratodyāpana, sarvaprāyaścitta and the gift of ten _dānas_ or if the dying man is unable to do these himself, the son or the other relative should perform these and give the merit thereof to the dying man. A person often resolves upon observing certain _vratas_, but fails to carry out all the details of those vratas to the end. The Vratodyāpana for the dying man is meant to cure all such unfinished vratas, The A.K.D. (pp. 3-4) has a long note about the performance of _vratodyāpana_. Briefly it comes to this. The son or other relative having brought about the purity of the dying man's body by a bath or by sprinkling it with holy water (_mārjana_) or by making him drink Ganges water, having himself taken a bath and performed his daily duties (of _sandhyā_). having lighted a lamp, having bowed to Ganeśa and prayed to god Visṇu, having placed before him the materials of worship and having repeated the usual saṅkalpa ( see note [^428]), he should honour a brāhmaṇa already invited and should give to him the gold (or silver ) set apart for the purpose and the brāhmaṇa should pronounce the words "May all vratas be fulfilled! May there be the attainment of the fruits of _udyāpana_ (accomplishment of vrata )". In the sarvaprāyascitta the son approaches 4 or 3 learned men or one man knowing _adhyātma_ (metaphysics) and offers the substitutes (of gold &c.) for sins that involve penances for 6,3 or 1 1/2 years or makes a declaration and performs the prāyaścitta, after the days of impurity.


[^427]: आसन्नमृत्युना देया गौः सवत्सा तु पूर्ववत्। तदभवे तु गौरेव नरकोत्तरणाव वै। तदा यदि न शवनोति दातुं वैत्तरणीं तु गाम्। शक्तोऽन्योऽरुक् तदा दच्वा दथाच्छेवो मृतस्य च ॥ व्यास. q. by शुद्धितत्त्व p 300, शुद्धिप्रकाश p 153. अ.क.दी . p 7. पूर्ववत् means हेमशृङ्गादिना. The गरुदपुराण (प्रेत) 4 6 says 'नदीं वैतरणीं तर्त्तु दयाद्वैतरणीं च माम्। कृष्णस्तनी सकृष्णाङ्गी सा वै वैतरणी स्मृता॥' The idea was that at the door of यम there was a river called वैतरणी, full of blood and sharp weapons and that there those who donated a cow at the time of death cross that terrible river by holding the cow's tail, vide स्कन्दपु VI 226 32–33 for वैतरणी and verse 34 is 'मृत्युकाले प्रयच्छन्ति ये धेनुं बाह्मणाय वै ॥ तस्या. पुच्छं समाश्रित्व ने तरन्ति च त्तां नृप ॥'. The श्राद्धरत्न of लक्ष्मीपति prescribes two _mantras_ at the time of donating the वैतरणी cow, one of which is उष्णे वर्षति शीते वा मारुते षाति वा भृशम्। दातारं त्रायते यस्मात्तस्माद्वेतरणी स्मृता ॥.

The sarvaprāyaścitta was to be performed by the dying man or by his son or other relative who was to shave himself, take a bath, drink _pañcagavya_, honour a brāhmaṇa with sandal paste and other things, after having honoured the cow or the money to be paid in lieu of it, and after referring to the several kinds of sins that one may be guilty of (vide note[^429]) he is to make a gift of a cow (with a calf) to the brāhmaṇa or in lieu of it, of some money. After sarvaprāyaścitta come the ten _dānas_ stated above. In the danas the Kāmastuti[^430] as studied by the followers of each veda was to be recited. The Garuḍapurāṇa (II. 4.7-9) further prescribes other dānas called mahā-dānas viẓ, of sesame, iron, gold, cotton, salt, seven kinds of corn, land and cows when a man is dying and also other gifts called padadānas such as of umbrella, sandals, ring, water-jar, seat, food.

## Thoughts of a dying man


The Garuḍapurāṇa (II 4 37) further provides that if a man about to die takes sannyāsa according to the rules laid down for what is called _āturasannyāsa_ he never returns to the cycle of births and deaths,

From ancient times it was a firmly held belief that the thoughts that a dying man entertains at the time of death determine what will happen to his spirit after physical death (this is expressed in the well-known words 'ante matih sā gatih'), that therefore a man should, when death approaches, give up all thoughts of mundane affairs and all earthly attachments, should think of his favourite deity. (Hari or Śiva), should inaudibly recite such _mantras_ as "om namo Vāsudevāya'. Several texts insist on making the dying man listen to holy Vedic texts. The Gautamapitṛ-medhasūtra (1.1-8) prescribes that one should at the time when one's father, mother, brother, teacher or a brāhmaṇa friend is on his death-bed make the dying man hear the first and last verses of the Veda and certain _sāmans_ and should mutter in the dying man's right ear (one sāman) The Ṛgvidhāna provides that one should repeat at the time of death the _sūkta_ beginning with 'trātāram' [^431]

The Hir. P. S. I. 1 provides that when it is thought that the _āhitāgnı_ is going to die, he (the son or the like) should mutter in the dying man's ear (if he is a knower of Brahma) the two _anuvākas_ of the Tai. Up. II. 1 (beginning with 'brahmavidāpnoti param') and III. 1 (beginning with 'Bhrgurvai vāruṇiḥ'). The A. K. D. (P 18) says [^432] that if the dying man is unable to engage in _japa_ he should revolve in his mind the benign form of Visṇu or Śiva and should listen to the thousand names (of Visṇu or Śiva), the Bhagavadgitā, the Bhāgavata, Bhārata, Rāmāyaṇa, the Upanisads like Īśāvāsya and hymns to Soma.

[^431]: त्रातारमिति सूक्तं तु अन्तकाले सदा पठेत्। जप्त्वा चैव परं स्थानममृतत्वाय कल्पते। ऋग्विधान q in शुद्धिप्रकाश p 154 The अन्त्येष्टिपद्धति  of नारायणभट्ट (Nir, edition, poth size p. 163 b) reads नानानमिति · स्थानममृतत्वं स गच्छतीति ऋग्विधानवन्दनात्॥ The _Ṛgvidhāna_ edited by Jagadish Shastrı reads (III.19-20) नानानमिति सूक्तानि अन्तकाले जपेत्सकृत्।. नानान is the first verse of Ṛg IX 112. It is likely that the editor of शुद्धप्रकाश misreads नानानमिति as त्रातारमिति, since त्रातारम् is not a sūkta (hymn) but only one stanza in a hymn.

## History of Dharmaśāstra

The germs of this idea are found even in the Upaniśads, The Chāndogya Up. (in the famous Śāndilya-vidyā, III, 14, 1) remarks 'All this is Brahman. A man should meditate on that (all this) as beginning, ending and subsisting in it (brāhmaṇn). Now man is a creature of his will. According to whatever is his will (or thought) in this world, so will he become after departing from this world.'[^433] The Praśna Up. II, 10 contains a similar idea. It is here asserted that it is thought power or the will that raises the soul higher and higher, and that the human mind should try to realize the idea that behind all physical transformations the Universe is one and is informed by one all-pervading Essence. Similarly, the Bhagavadgitā puts this idea in a much more clear way. The man, who remembering me alone in his last moments, departs from this life, comes to me, there is no doubt about this' ( 8,5). But in order to guard against the possible inference that it is only the thoughts at the approach of death that matter whatever the past life led by a dying man may have been, the next verse emphasizes that a man's spirit is engrossed by the thoughts that he has entertained throughout life and that a man can think of spiritual matters or about God at the time of death only if he has been thinking about such matters or about God throughout his life. That verse (8.6) is 'whichever form (or thing) a man remembers when he leaves the body at death, to that alone he goes, having been always (throughout his life) engrossed in meditating over it"

Some of the digests, on the authority of several Puraṇas, prescribe that the dying man should be taken, if possible, near a holy place (_tirtha_) such as the Ganges. For example, the Śuddhitattva[^434] (p 299) quotes a passage from the Kūrmapurāṇā to this effect 'a man attains _mokśa_ (final release from _samsāra_) by dying in the waters of the Ganges, on land or in water at Vārānasi (Benares) and at the confluence of the Ganges with the sea either on land, in water or in the air.'

[^433]: सर्वं खल्विदं ब्रह्म तज्जलानिति शान्त उपासीताथ खलु ऋतुमय. पुरुषो यथाऋतुर्स्मिँल्लोके पुरुषो भवति तथेत प्रेत्य भवति स क्रतु कुर्वीत। छा उप  III. 14 1. अन्तकाले च मामेव स्मरन्मुक्त्वा कलेवरम् । य. प्रयाति स मद्भावं याति नास्त्यत्र सशय ॥ य य वापि स्मरन्भावं त्यजत्यन्ते कलेवरम् । त तमेवैति कौन्तेय सदा तद्भावभावित ॥ भगवद्गीता 8.5-6, vide शाङ्करभाष्य on वे सू I 2 1 for the explanation of तज्जलान् and on वे.सू.

## Death near a holy place

 Another passage to the same effect is quoted from the 'Skanda-purāṇa and it is further said in the same Purāṇa that for one _gavyūti_ from the banks of the Ganges is a _kṣetra_ (holy place): 'gifts, _japa_ (muttering of sacred texts), _homa_ performed within this extent is equal to doing the same on the Ganges itself, those who die within this _kṣetra_ go to heaven and are not born again. In the Pujāratnākara[^435] it is said: 'Hari is present wherever there is the Śālagrāma stone; one dying near ā Śālagrāma stone reaches the highest abode of Viṣṇu'. It was said that a person (even a non-Aryan) dying within one krosa of a Śalagrāma reaches Vaikuntha (world of Viṣṇu) Similarly, one dying in a garden of tulasi (Basil) plants or with Tulasi leaf placed in his mouth at the time of death attains _mokṣa_ even if guilty of crores of sins. These are popular notions held even up to this day among common people, not thoroughly affected by modern ideas.

There are also dicta about the time when it is best to die. The Śantiparva of the Mahābhārata states 'he who dies after the sun has gone to the northern direction (i.e, when the apparent motion of the sun towards the north begins ) and on any auspicious _nakśatra_ and _muhūrta_ is really one who has a store of merit (with him )'[^436]. This is based on the ideas of death in _Uttarāyana_ and _Dakṣiṇāyana_ found in the Upaniṣads. For example, the Chāndogya Up. (IV. 15. 5-6 ) states "Now ( if one who knows this dies) whether people perform obsequies for him or not he goes to light (_arcis_ ), from light to day, from day to the bright half of the moon, from thence to the six months during which the sun goes to the north, from the months to the year, from the year to the sun, from the sun to the moon, from the moon to lightning.

[^435]: पूजारत्नाकरे। शालग्रामशिला यत्र तत्र संनिहितो हरिः। तत्सन्निधौ त्यजेत् प्राणान् याति विष्णोः परं पदम्॥ लिङ्गपुराणे। शालग्रामसमीपे तु क्रोशमात्रं समन्तत। कीकतेपि मृतो याति वैकुण्ठभवनं नरः । वैष्णवामृते व्यासः। तुलसीकानने जन्तोर्यदि मृत्युभवेत् क्वचित् । स निर्भत्स्य नरं पापी लीलयैव हरिं विशेत् ॥ प्रयाणकाले यस्यास्ये दीयते तुलसीदलम् । निर्वाणं याति पक्षीन्द्र पापकोटियुतोपि सः ॥ शुद्धितत्त्व p. 299, शुद्धिप्रकाश P 155. कीकट is the country of Magadha, which was regarded as a land beyond the pale of Aryanism in the Ṛgveda (III 53.14). Vide Nir VI 32 where the country of कीकट is said to be अनार्यनिवास. The शुद्धिप्रकाश reads कीटकोऽपि (even a norm) for कीकटेपि, which is better, but might be an emendation.

  There is a person who is not human that leads them to brāhmaṇ. This is the path of the Devas, the path that leads to brāhmaṇ. Those who proceed on that path do not return to the life of man, yes, _they do not return_'. There is a similar passage in Chāndogya Up. V. 10.1-2 where it is said that even householders who know the doctrine of the five fires (_Pañcāgni-vidyā_) and those who in the forest follow the path of faith and austerities (i,e. _vānaprasthas_ and _parivrājakas_ wbo do not yet know Highest brāhmaṇṇ) go by the path called Devayāna, while (V, 10. 3—7) those, who, living in a village, practise , sacrifices, works of public utility and alms, go to smoke, from smoke to night, from night to the dark half of the inoon, from thence to the six months when the sun goes to the south, from thence to the worlds of the fathers, from thence to ether (_ākāśa_) and to the moon, where they consume their works and return again the way they came. The Chān Up. (V, 10. 8) refers to a third place where small creatures (like flies, worms &c.) are continually going and returning. The Br. Up. (VL 2. 15-16 ) contains similar passages about Devaloka, pitṛloka and the third world of worms, birds and creeping beings. The Bhagavadgitā, basing itself on these Upaniṣad passages, puts the matter succinctly (in 8 23-25) as follows:-'I shall state the times at which devotees departing from this world go, never to return or to return. The fire, the flame, the day, the bright fortnight, the six months of the northern (apparent) motion of the sun; departing from the world in these those who know the brāhmaṇ go to brāhmaṇ. Smoke, night, the dark fortnight, the six months of the southern (apparent) motion of the sun; dying in these the devotee goes to the lunar light and returns. These two paths, bright and dark, are deemed to be eternal in this world. By the one a man goes never to return, by the other he comes back'. The Vedāntasūtra (IV, 3 4-6) explains that the words 'light' 'day' and others are not to be taken in their literal sense (i,e. as signposts or stages on the paths) but they are to be understood as referring to superintending deities that help the spirits and lead them on the path to the worlds of the Devās or of Pitṛs (i e. they are _ātivāhikas_ and _abhımānidevatās_). Śhaṅkara on Vedāntasūtra IV. 2. 20 (ataścāyanepi daksine) explains that the waiting for the -day of Uttarāyaṇa on the part of Bhiṣma (narrated in the Mahābhārata) is only meant as a eulogy of the path called,'arcirādi', that one who has realized brāhma, even if he dies in dakṣiṇāyana, does secure the fruits of his knowledge (viz.reaching Brahma), that Bhiṣma waited for the beginning of _uttarāyaṇa_ to abide by popular ideas and practices and to show that he possessed the power to depart from the world at his wil owing to the boon conferred on him by his father.


## Death in Uttarāyana

 The Yajñavalkya-smrti refers to the path (devayāna) [^437] that leads to Devaloka (in III. 193-194, where it reads 'mānasah' for 'amānavah' of the Ch. Up.) and the Pitṛyāṇa (in III, 195-196). In spite of the interpretations of the Vedāntasūtra (and of Śaṅkara) the popular belief that death in Uttarāyaṇa is best persisted and still persists. For example, the Baud, P.S.(II.7, 21 ) remarks '(the sages) provide that death during the northern path of the sun, in the bright half of a month, during the day and at the end of a Śrauta sacrifice is best[^438]' The G. P. S. (II. 7.1-2) remarks: 'It is desirable to avoid dying in the dark half of a month or at night and the following _sūtras_ provide for the offering of certain oblations if the death occurs in the dark half or at night.



[^437]: The words 'devayāna' and 'pitṛyāna' are a legacy from the hoary past. Even in the Ṛg. there are frequent references to them. In Ṛg III. 58 5 the Aśvins are addressed a prayer 'may you come here (to this sacrifice) by the paths leading to the abode of the gods' (eha yātam pathibhurdevayānaih). Ṛg. VII 38 8 also has a similar idea 'may you, being gratified, go by the devayāna paths' (trptā yātam pathibhir-devayānaih). In Ṛg-VII 76.2 (addressed to Uśas) the sage Vasistha exclaims that he has seen the Devayāna paths when the dawn shone in the East (pra me panthā devayāna adrśran). Agni is asked to make the devayāna paths easily accessible and to carry the offerings in a pleased mood (Ṛg. X 51.5, sugān pathaḥ krnuhi devayānān vaha havyāni sumanasyamānah) Ṛg. X 98 11 describes Agni as knowing the _devayāna_ paths according to the seasons and a prayer is offered to him to place Aulāna (son of Śantanu) in heaven among the gods (vidvān patha ṛtuśo devayānān-apyaulānam divi devesu dhehi). In Ṛg. X 18.1 it is stated that the path of Death is different from devayāna (paran mrtyo anu parehı panthām yaste sva itaro devayānāt). In Ṛg X 2.7 Agni is said to know the pitṛyāna path (panthāmanu pra vidvān pitṛyānam). In the Tai. Br II 6 3 5 it is said 'I have heard of two paths of the Fathers; I have heard about the paths of the gods and mortals' (dve sruti aśrnavam pitṛṇām aham devānām-uta martyānām), The Sat Br. I 9.3 2 remarks "this is the path called Devayāna or Pitṛyāna.' In the Br, Up. 1.5.16 it is said 'there are indeed three worlds, viz. the world of men, the world of _pitṛs_ and the world of gods'.

FUNERAL RITES (antyeṣṭi) are a saṁskāra. Antyeṣṭi is one of the 16 (or more) saṁskāras of a twice-born person performed with Vedic mantras according to Manu II. 16, Yāj. I 10, Jātūkarnya[^439]. These saṁskāras were formerly performed for women also (Āśv gr I 15.12, L 16 6, 1. 17-11, Manu II. 66) but without Vedic mantras (except in marriage) and for sūdras also (Manu X, 127, Yāj I. 10) but without Vedic mantras. The Baud. P.S. III, 1.4 states that there are two saṁskāras of every human being and they are like a debt i.e. they must be performed, just as a debt must be discharged viz the saṁskāra on birth and the one on death (mr̥tasaṁskāra). Funeral rites and rites after death varied according as the deceased was an āhitāgni (one who had consecrated the śrauta fires) or one who had only kindled the smārta fire, or one who had neither the śrauta fires nor the smārta fire, or a woman, a child, an ascetic (_parıvrājaka_), or one dying in a distant land or one dying by accident or committing suicide &c. The śrauta and grḥyasūtras differ among themselves in many details even on the same topic and the procedure becomes more elaborate in medieval and later times. It would be impossible to state all the differences on each topic in this section. A separate volume would have to be written for the purpose of setting out all the variations and. additions from ancient times to modern times, to discuss why and how they arose or were made, to compare the various sūtras and to compare these again with the puraṇas and medieval digests, and to appraise their worth or usefulness. All that can be attempted here is to give the bare outlines of the procedure in different sūtras, smṛtis and digests by way of sample in a chronological order. The Nirṇayasindhu (p. 569 ) expressly says that the last rites differ in each Sākhā, though certain things are common to all [^439a]. Chronological conclusions have been drawn about the relative ages of the sūtras ( as Dr. Caland does), of the smṛtis, purāṇas and nibandhas from the presence or absence of this or that detail or the elaboration of this or that ritual. But with 'all respect to the industrious scholars of the West such conclusions are often tentative or misleading and are purely subjective in many cases and are often due to ignorance or loss of ancient works.

## Ṛgveda X 14-18

Before setting out the rites of cremation contained in the Śrauta sūtras, Grḥya sūtras and later works, it would be best to give here a translation of the five hymns from the Ṛg. (X. 14-18)[^440]. The verses in these hymns are employed by most of the sūtras and are used even now in the cremation rites and most of them about in the other Vedic Samhitās. Varying interpretations have been given of some of these stanzas by Indian and Western commentators and critics. Only a few of these have been mentioned in the notes. Besides some stanzas are employed for different details of the cremation rites by the different sūtras. All such differences cannot be set out for want of space. The five hymns are so placed that they follow the order of the stages in which the funeral ritual proceeded in fact and is performed even now to a great extent. Vide Appendix for the text of the Ṛgveda hymns without accents[^441].


440. The work of Bertram S Packle on 'Funeral customs' (London, 1926) is a very interesting and instructive one. It describes at great length funeral customs in various parts of England, France and other countries in Europe and among Jews and also in other parts of the world. Many of the customs and beliefs that he records bear a close resemblance to customs and beliefs in ancient and modern India, such, as, for example, the alighting of a raven or other black feathered bird on a cottage where a man is very ill as a death warning (p 17), washing and anointing of dead bodies before burial (pp. 34, 36), the hiring of professional women for wailing and shrieking for the dead (p 67), condemning burial at night (p 77), the cutting of the hair as a sign of mourning (p. 91). placing meat and drink on the grave for the spirit of the departed (pp 99-100), refusal of burial in the churchyard by the Church for unbaptised children, suicides, lunatics, and those excommunicated (p. 143).

441. Vide Appendix.

## Ṛgveda X. 14.

  X. 14.1 (O! sacrificer!) worship with an offering Yama, king (of pitṛs), son of Vivasvat, the gatherer of men ( that are dead ), who sought out the way for many (men who do meritorious acts) and who passed along great (non-terrestrial) heights[^442].
  2. Yama was the first to know (find out) the path for us men; that is a pasture (abode ) that cannot be taken away (by anybody), that is (an abode) where our ancient ancestors went, each knowing his own way thereto[^443].
  3. Mātali (Indra's charioteer or Indra himself) with the (pitṛs ) called _kavya_, Yama with the Angirases and Brhaspati with the Ṛkvans become prosperous (or increase in strength); whom (the pitṛs) the gods support and who support the gods; some of them (the gods, Indra and others) are delighted by _svāhā_ (by offerings given after uttering that word) and others (pitṛs) are delighted by _svadhā_[^444].
  4. O! Yama! Being of one mind with the pitṛs çalled Angirases come to this (sacrifice) and sit down on the seat (of kuśas). May the _mantras_ recited by the wise (priests) bring you (here). May you (O king) delight yourself with this offering!
  5. O Yama! (come with the adorable) Angirases and Vairūpas and delight (or exhilarate) yourself. I invoke Vivasyat, your father; (May he delight himself) after sitting on the kuśa grass (spread) in this sacrifice[^445].
  6. The Angirases, the Navagvas,[^446] the Atharvans, the Bhṛgus are our pitṛs and love soma (drink). May we secure the good will of those adorable ones! May we be in their gracious favour also!
  7. Hasten, hasten[^447] by the ancient paths (to that place) where our forefathers that went before us passed. May you (the departed) see the two kings Yama and god varuṇa rejoicing as they will.
  8. (O departed one!) be united in the highest heaven with the pitṛs, with Yama and with your _istāpūrta_; leaving here blamable acts (sins), come back to your home! Being endowed with bright lustre, be united with a (new)[^448] body!
  9. (Ye evil spirits! ) Gọ away, depart, move aside from this place ( the cemetery), the pitṛs made (or assigned) for him (the departed person ) this abode Yama gives to him (this) resting place characterized by waters, days and nights.
  10. (O departed !) proceeding by a good path, hurry on past the two dappled dogs (of Yama), offspring of Saramā, each having four eyes. Thus approach the pitṛs who will recognize[^449] you and who enjoy delight in the company of Yama.
  11. O king Yama! Give him (the departed one) in charge of those two dogs of yours, who are guards, having four eyes each, who guard the path (to pitṛ-loka) and who watch men. May you bestow on him happiness and health!.
  12. The two messengers of Yama, that have wide nostrils, that are very strong, that are satisfied with difficulty, move among the people. May those two (messengers) restore to us to-day auspicious life in order that we may see the Sun![^450].
  13. Extract Soma juice for Yama (O priests !), offer oblation to Yama.[^451] Sacrifice, in which Agni is messenger (carrier) to the gods and which is well prepared reaches Yama.
  14. (O priests) offer oblation sprinkled with ghee to Yama and then start. May he keep us (tied) to the worship of gods,[^452] so that we may live a long life!
  15. Offer to king Yama an oblation which is extremely sweet. Here is salutation to the sages who were born before us and who made the path for us.
  16. The one great (Bṛhat-sāman) passes in three sacrifices (called Jyotir-gaur-āyuh) to the six wide expanses[^453]. Tristubh, Gāyatrī and the metres are all centered in Yama.


[^442]: X.14.1. This verse is explained in Nir X 20. 'Pareyivāmsam' may also be taken with 'panthām', The meaniag of 'pravataḥ' is rather uncertain, The Tai Ā. VI 1.1, Sat. Śr. 28 1 20, Baud. P.S. (1.2), Vaik, Sr. S. 20.22 (p. 311) read 'pareyuvāmsam'.

[^443]: It is quite possible to understand 'eva jajñānāh' as meaning 'being thus born' (like ourselves). 'eva' being taken adverbially and
jajñānāh' from 'jan' (to be born). Compare A V 18 3.13 यो ममार प्रथमो मर्त्याना य प्रेयाय प्रथमो लोकमेतम्। . The Parsi scriptures also speak of Yama (Yima) as the first mortal and as the son of Vivanghat Vide Vendidad, Far_ard II 1. p 11. (SBE, vol. IV)

[^444]: Kāvyas, Aṅgirases and Rkvans are different classes of Pitṛs. In Ṛg VII 10 4 the Rkvans (singers) are associated with Bṛhaspati. In other places they are associated with Viṣṇu, Aja-Ekapāt and Soma also. The exclamation svāhā is uttered when making an offering to Gods and svadhā when making an offering to pitṛs.

[^445]: 'Nisadya' is really a gerund and not a finite verb. We have to supply some verb like 'mādyatām' understood from the preceding half. Vairūpas are a subdivision of the Aṅgiras group.

[^446]: Navagvas seem to be a subdivision of Aṅgirases, just as 'daśagvas' are, as in Ṛg III 39,5, IV 51 4, V 29 12, X 62.6. The late Mr Tilak in his 'Arctic' home in the Vedas' (pp 162-169) gave a somewhat far-fetched interpretation of these two words which can hardly be accepted as satisfactory in the presence of words like 'atithigva' (Ṛg. I 53 8, I 307, II 147, IV 26 3. VIII 68,17). 'abbiyugvan' (Ṛg VI 45 15), 'etagva' (Ṛg. VIII 70.7). This verse is explained in Nır XI 19.

[^447]: This and the followiag three stanzas are addressed to the departed man. For the meaning and history of the word Istāpūrta, vide H of Dh, vol II. pp, 843-845. It means 'the cumulative spiritual result or merit due to the performance of sacrifices and charitable acts'.

[^448]: This appears to postulate the acquisition of a new ethereal body for the departed enabling him to enjoy the pleasures of pitr̥loka.

[^449]: 'Suvıdatrān' - who will know or recognize you. The Nir, V1.14 explains 'suvıdatrāh kalyānavidyāh'.

[^450]: The life implored for here is that of the persons related to the deceased who are left behind on the earth. 'Asutrpa' according to Sāyana and Oldenberg means 'who steal away the lives of men'. This is a good meaning in view of what is stated in the last _pāda_ of the verse. In trans 1ating as done above the word is taken as 'a+śu+trpa', while Sāyana takes it as 'asu +- trpa'.

[^451]: This and the folloring two verses are addressed to the priests.

[^452]: "Sa no devesvāyamad' - For the 'translation of these words given above, compare Ṛg. IX. 44 5.

[^453]: This is rather a very obscure stanza The A. V. reads 'pavate' for 'patati'. 'Trıkadruka' occurs frequently in connection with Soma (as in Ṛg II 22 1; VIII 92,21). Sāyana explains that for the performance of Trikadruka sacrifices Yama gives protection and that he comes to the six wide ones for supervising over what was done or not done. The six are mentioned in Sat Br 1.5 1.22 as fire, earth, water, wind, day and night. The six wide ones are referred to in Ṛg VI 473. The conception is rather vague. The meaning probably is that in the Trikadruka sacrifices the Brhatsāma is sung and it reverberates throughout the universe (symbolized as the six wide ones) and that all the verses recited in the several metres do the same.

## Ṛgveda X. 15.

X. 15. 1. May the Soma--loving [^454] pitṛs, whether of the lower, middling or higher grade, come forward, those pitṛ̥s that attained life (an eternal life or a life of spirit) being kind hearted and knowing _rta_ (the rule of right)! May those pitr̥s protect us when invoked!
2. Today may this be our salutation to the pitr̥s who went (died) before (the birth of this departed one) or who went after (the birth of the departed [^455]), also (those pitr̥s) that are seated in this world or those who have places among the powerful people.
3. I have known the pitr̥s as those who will recognize (me, their descendant) and I have known the stride of Viṣṇu and the child (viz. Agni), the pitṛs who sit on kuśa grass and partake of food and Soma offering at their will, repeatedly come here[^456].
4. O pitṛs, that occupy kuśa grass! (come) down towards us with your protection, we have prepared for you these offerings; accept them. May you come with very blissful protection and then may grant us happiness that is free from trouble (or evil)! [^457]
5. May the Soma-loving pitṛs invited by us to the dear treasures (offerings) placed on the kuśa grass come! May they hear (our prayers) here! May they speak in favour of us and may they protect us!
6. O Fathers! May you all, bending your knee and sitting to the right side (of the offering ) commend our sacrifice; whatever fault we may commit in reference to you through our being (erring) men, do not injure us for the sake of that.
7, O Fathers! sitting in front of (in the lap of) brilliant (flames ) may you bestow wealth on ( me) the mortal sacrificer! May you give wealth to the sons (of the deceased mortal) and may you impart vigour (to them)!
8. May Yama desiring offerings and enjoying the company of our ancient and rich pitṛs, who came to (or valued) Soma drinks one after another, who were glorious and in whose company Yama (the king of pitṛs) found great delight. partake of (eat) the offerings (given by us) according to his liking[^458].
9. O Agni! come down towards us with the pitṛs that were thirsting and gaping (to reach the world of the gods), that know about sacrifice and that were authors of _stomas_ by means of prayers (that they offered), that know us well, that are unfailing (in responding to our call), that partake of the _kavya_ offering and that sit round the heated milk.
10. O Agni! come with the pitṛs earlier and later (in time) that are unfailing, that partake of the offerings (presented to them), that drink the offerings, that are seated in the same chariot with Indra and the gods, that make obeisances to the gods in their thousands, that sit round the hot milk.
11. O pitṛs called Agnisvātta [^459], that are good guides! Come (to this rite) and sit down each on his proper seat. Eat (partake of) the pure offerings (offered) on the sacred kuśa grass and then bestow wealth (or prosperity) together with all heroic sons.
12. O Agni Jātavedas! when praised (by us) you, having made the oblations savoury, have carried them and presented (them to the pitṛs). May they eat them as is their wont (or as they are offered with the word svadhā)| O God! May you eat (partake of) the pure offerings!
13. O Jātavedas! you know how many (pitṛs) are there, viz, those who are here (near us), those who are not here, those whom we know and those whom we do not know (because they are remote ancestors). Be gracious to accept as is your habit this sacrifice which is well prepared.
14. (O Agni) Resplendent (or self-ruling) along with those (pitṛs) who (whose bodies) were burnt by fire and also whose bodies were not burnt and who enjoy delight (on account of offerings made) with _svadha_ (or as is their wont) in the midst of the heavens. May you arrange a body as (the deceased) desires that will inspire him to a (new) life (in heaven)!


[^454]: X 15.1 This and the following seven stanzas were employed as mantras in offering oblations to pitṛs in the rite performed on the day previous to the day (8th tithi) of Astakā-śrāddha, vide Aśv. gr. 11, 4 6.

[^455]: X 15. 2. 'Purvāsah' and 'uparāsah' may simply mean 'ancient and modern' 'Parthive rajasi'probably means 'the regions contiguous to or just above the earth'

[^456.]: X. 15 3, "Napātam' is difficult to construe: probably it refers to Agni who is often addressed as 'ūrjo napāt' (Ṛg. I, 58,8, II, 6,2, VI.48.2).

[^457]: X. 15.4. 'Sam yoḥ' 15 explained by the Nir. IV. 21 as शमनं च रोगाणां यावनं च भयानाम् and रप: in अरप: as meaning पाप.

[^458]: X. 15.8. अनूहिरे is perfect of either वह् with अनु or of ऊह् with अनु. वसिष्ठा: may be taken as meaning 'Vasistha, his descendants and others' and as the worshippers of pitṛs or simply means 'rich or dressed in rich clothes.

[^459]: X, 15 11. अग्निष्वात्त = अग्नि + स्वात्त ( from स्वद्) means 'tasted of licked by Agni'.

## Ṛgveda X. 16.

X. 16. 1. O Agni! Do not burn out this (departed person?), do not singe him all round, do not throw here and there ( parts of) of his skin or his body , O Jātavedas (fire)! when you burn him completely, may you send him ( the deceased) on to the pitṛs !
2. O Jātavedas: When you thoroughly burn this (departed person), then may you hand him over to the pitṛs! When he (the dead person ) follows this (path) that leads on to a (new) life, may he become one that carries out the wishes of the gods[^460]!
3. May your eye (of the deceased) go to the Sun, your breath to the wind, may you go to Heaven and earth by your merit or you may go to the waters if you find pleasure there (or if that be your lot)! May you rest (stand) with all your limbs in the herbs!
4 O Jāta Vedas! May you burn by your heat the goat that is your share ! May your flame, may your bright light burn that goat, [^461] carry this (departed) to the world of those who do good deeds by means of your beneficent bodies (flames).
5. O Agni! discharge again towards the pitṛs (this deceased) who being offered on to you moves about (or wanders) as is his habit. O Jātévedas! may he take on (a new life and increase his offerings and be united with a new (ethereal) body. [^462]
6. (O dead man!) May Agni who consumes all make free from blemish that limb of yours which the dark bird (crow) has pierced or an ant or a snake or a wild beast struck at and may Soma that entered into the brāhmaṇas do the same[^463].
7. (O deceased) put on (yourself) with cows an armour (i.e. against fire flames ) of Agni (i.e. with the skin of the cow) and surround yourself with the thick fat (of the cow), so that (Agni) that overwhelms with his lustre, that takes delight (in destroying things), that is bold and seeks to burn completely may not scatter (all your parts).
8. O Agni! do not destroy this cup that is dear to the gods and the Soma-loving (pitṛs ). In this cup from which the gods drink, the immortal gods take delight[^464].
9. I send far away the fire that eats raw flesh; may Agni that carries evil (or sins) go (to regions) where Yama reigns! The other Agni (Jātavedas), knowing everything, may take even here the offering to the gods.
10. I, observing the other Agni (Jātavedas) for the purpose of offering a sacrifice to the pitṛs, leave aside the fire that devours raw flesh and that entered your house; may he (the other fire) urge on to the highest world the _gharma_ (heated milk or sacrifice [^465]).
11. May that fire which carries the _havya_[^466] offerings offer them to the pitṛs that prosper according to rta! May he offer the oblations to the gods and pitṛs!
12. (O Agni!) we who love you have established you and have kindled you. May you loving (the pitṛs) bring here the pitṛs that love us in order that they may partake of the offering!
13. O Agni! May you extinguish (with water) that spot which you burnt (at the) time of cremation! May Kiyāmbu (plant) arise here and may dūrvā creeper spreading its tendrils grow here!
14. O Śītikā (cool plant), O herb full of cooling effect, O Hladikā (freshening herb) causing delight, may you be well associated with a she frog! May you gladden this fire!


[^460]: X. 16. 2. The words असुनितिमेता have in view the words असुनीतिमेतां यथावश तन्वं कल्पयस्व  in X 15 14 above.

[^461]: X 16.4 अजो भाग -This refers to the goat that was optionally carried with the dead body Vide note 486 below and Ṛg, X 16,7 where the cow is mentioned as being burnt with the dead body.

[^462]: X 16 5. For the meaning of शेषस्, compare Ṛg. VII 4.7 ( न शेषो अग्ने अन्यजातमस्ति).

[^463]: X 16 6-For सोम ..आविवेश, compare 'सोमोऽस्माकं ब्राह्मणाना राजां' शतपथव्रा V, 4.2 3 and ' स यदि सोमं ब्राह्मणाना भक्ष' ऐ. वा.) 35 3. In X.16.7 the idea seems to be that when the corpse is covered with the parts of a slaughtered animal the corpse may not be burnt too quickly.

[^464]: X 16.8. This mantra is repeated as invocation when the _pranītā_ water is carried forward in the cup. As stated below all sacrificial implements are placed on the body of the deceased āhitāgni and burnt. But the sage prays that the cup may not be completely destroyed, since it may have to be used in the other world by the departed spirit.

[^465]: X. 16. 10. This verse is rather involved. If the words of this verse and the next are literally construed it would ̐ seem that the _kravyād_ fire was employed for pitṛyajñā. It is possible to hold that _kravyād_ fire was considered as something evil and to be kept distinct from the ordinary or sacrificial fire.

[^466]: X 16.11 Sāyana explains on the assumption that the word is kavyavāhana in this, while the Samhitā and the padapātha hare kravyavāhana. The Vāj S. 19 65 and Tai S. II. 6 12 5 read 'kavyavāhanah'. Here apparently at least the flesh-eating fire is admitted not only in the rites for the pitṛs but also in the rites for gods.

## Ṛgveda X. 17.   

X. 17. The verses of this hymn, except 3-6, have hardly any bearing on funeral rites. Therefore only those four verses are translated here. The first two verses refer to the marriage of Vivasvat with the daughter of Tvastr and to the legend of the birth of Yama and Yami from Vivasvat. Both are explained at length in Nir. XI. 10-11. Verses[^467] 7-9 which contain prayers to Sarasvati are almost the same as A. V. 18. 1. 41-43 and are employed by the Kauśika-sūtra (81,39) in the cremation rite along with A. V. 7.68 1-2 and 18 3,25.

3. May the all-knowing Pūsan, who does not allow cattle to perish and who protects the world, discharge ( despatch ) you from this ( world to the next)! May he (Pūsan) hand you over to these pitṛs and may Agni hand you over to the gods that know you well!
4. ·May Pūsan, who is the life of the Universe and who is himself life, protect you ! May he who is ahead of you guard you on the way (to heaven)! May god Savitṛ place you in that place where the doers of good deeds went and dwell.
5. Pūsan knows all these quarters in order ; may he take us by (a path ) most free from danger! He is the bestower of happiness, full of refulgence, he has all heroes with him; may he (Pūsan) the wise one go in front of us without committing a mistake!
6. Pūsan exists (stands) in the forefront of the paths (leading to the world of pitṛs ), of the paths leading to heaven and of the paths on the earth. He stands facing both the worlds that are very dear (to all) and he, the knowing one, travels towards and away from both.

467. Sarasvati is a sacred river and also imagined as a deity. Ṛg VI. 61 and VII 95 are two hymns addressed to Sarasvati. Probably waters of rivers were used at the time of cremation and they are all identified with and held as sacred as Sarasvati.

468. X 18.2 This verse is addressed to the relatives when they turn homeward after cremation.


## Ṛgveda X. 18.

X. 18. 1. O Death! Move aside along another path that is your own and different from the Devayāna path. I address you who have eyes and ears. Do not injure our children, do not harm our heroic sons.
2. (O relatives )[^468] that are sacrificers! Since you have come obliterating the foot-prints of Death and firmly establishing long life for yourselves, prospering with progeny and wealth, may you be pure and holy!
3. These living (relatives) have turned back separated from the dead; this day our invocation (sacrifice to ) of the gods became auspicious. We then went forward for dancing, for laughter (with our children) firmly establishing our long life.
4. I place (here) this barrier (stone) for the (protection of) the living (relatives, son and the like) so that none of them may go this goal that the departed went). May they live for a hundred prosperous autumns! May they keep off Death by means of the mountain[^469] (the stone).
5. O Dhātṛ! Arrange the lives of these (the survivors) in the same way as the days come one after another in proper order, as the seasons follow each other in a proper order, as a younger one does not abandon an elder (relative)[^470].
6. May you (the survivors) accepting old age attain (long) life, striving in order (of age) what ever your numbers may be ; may Tvaṣtr of noble birth and gracious give you here (in this world ) a long life to live![^471]
7. Let these women whose husbands are worthy and are living enter the house with ghee (applied) as collyrium (to their eyes). Let these wives first step into house, tearless, without any affliction[^472] and well adorned.
8. O wife (of the dead)! Raise yourself up towards the world of the living (your sons and other relatives); you lie down near one (your husband) who is now lifeless; come! You have kept true to this your wifehood of the husband who held your hand (formerly in marriage) and who loved you passionately[^473].
9. (I) Take the bow from the hand of the departed (kṣatriya) in order that there may be in us martial vigour, brilliance and strength[^474]. May thou (the departed) there and may we here be endowed with heroic sons and conquer here all competing and aggressive enemies !
10. (O departed) approach this mother Earth which is spread wide and is pleasant. May this young one (the Earth) as soft as (wool) to you who have bestowed gifts save you from the lap of Death[^475].  
11. O Earth! heave yourself up, do not crush it, be of easy approach and of easy resort to him, and O Earth! cover him (the dead person represented by his bones) just as a mother would cover her son with the fringe (of her garment)[^476].
12. Let the Earth heave itself up and remain firm. Let the pillars in their thousands stand up supporting this house. May these homes (the clods of earth) drop him nourishment! May they become here for all days the shelter[^477] for him (the departed represented by bones)!
13. I prop up the earth around you for your sake. May I placing this lump of clay receive no harm. May the pitṛs support (make steady) this post![^478] May Yama provide here seats (or resting places) for you.
14. (The gods) have placed me in the day that will come back (tomorrow) like the feather of an arrow; (therefore) I restrain backwards (stop) my speech as a person restrains a horse with a bridle[^479].

[^469]: X 18 4. Paridhis are encircling sticks of sacrificial wood such as palāśa, khadira placed round the fire. This verse is employed by Asy. gr. IV. 6.9 in the Śantikarma performed after the collection of bones. Here the fire is surrounded on three sides by the wooden sticks and a stone is placed on the north of the fire with the last quarter as stated by Aśv, gr. IV. 6. 10 अन्तर्मृत्युं दधतां पर्वतेनेत्यश्नानमुत्तरतोऽग्नेः कृत्वा...यथाहान्यनुपूर्वे भवन्ती स्वनात्यानीक्षेत ।  अनात्य here means all members of the family, men and women, except the performer of the rite.

[^470]: X 18.5 यथा न पूर्वमपरो &C. Probably this refers to the funeral procession arranged according to ages, as Aśv. gr. IV. 2.9 states expressly 'अन्वञोऽनात्या अघोनिवीताः प्रवृत्तशिखा ज्येष्ठप्रथनाः कनिष्ठजवन्याः'. The ato वौ.पि.सू remarks 'अथैनाननुपूर्वे कल्पयति यथाहान्यवुपूर्वे भवन्तीति or the idea may be that each generation should die in the order it was born and that a son should not die before his father.

[^471]: X. 18.6. This may be symbolic of the fact that the members of the family of the deceased are made to stand on the hide of an ox spread to the west of the fire. Vide Aśr. gr. IV. 6.8 'अथाग्निमुपसमाधाय पश्र्वादस्यानडुहं चर्मात्त्वीर्य ...वलिसनात्यामारोहरेदारोहतायुजरसं वृणाना इति.'

[^472]: X 18 7. This verse was employed in the procedure of widow burning (sati or sahamarana or anugamana) by medieval and later writers. Some of them read 'agneh' or 'agne' for "agre'. But even without this change Aparārka (p. 111) and others rely for the practice of _sati_ on this verse. For a discussion on this verse and the next, the different readings in the old texts, the different theories built upon these and the practice of widow burning, vide H. of Dh. vol. II pp. 617-619 and pp, 625-635.

[^473]: X. 18. 8: This verse is somewhat misplaced. It should occur earlier in X.14 The last quarter is rather difficult to construe. In the Tat Ā VI 1 there is a similar verse 'इय नारी पतिलोक वृणाना निपथत उप त्वा मर्त्य प्रेतम् । विश्वं पुराणमनुपालयन्ती तस्यै प्रजा द्रविणं चेह धेहि'॥ The Tai Ā. VI 1 also has the verse उदीर्ण्व नार्यभिः and as printed reads 'सम्बभूव', but सायण explains आभिमुख्येन सम्यक प्राप्नुहि (i.e he explains सम्बभूथ) The वौ.पि.सू. पिच 18.1-2 reads सबभूव and says about Ṛg X 18 8 and Tai, Ā verse अथास्य भार्यामुपसवेशयति । इयं नारी . धेहीति । ता प्रतिहितः सव्ये पाणावभिपाद्योत्थापयति उदीर्ण्व...बभूवेति।

[^474]: X 18.9: अस्मे is used with all cases as shown by the Nır. VI.7, Here it may be equal to अस्मन्यं or अस्मासु. This verse also should occur earlier along with verse 8 above. In Sān Sr 16 13 13 botb 8 and 9 are called utthāpıni (verses) 'उदीर्ण्व नार्युदीर्ष्वात' पतिवत्युदीर्ण्वातो विश्वावसोऽश्मन्वतीत्युत्थापिन्य'. The com remarks 'आभिर्होवादयो महिषीमुत्थापयन्ति'. उदीर्ण्वात पतिवती is Ṛg X 85 21, उदीर्ण्वातो विश्वावसो is Ṛg X 85.22 and अश्मन्वती is Ṛg X 53 8. These are recited in अश्वमेध at the time of making the crowned queen get up from near the dead horse. Compare H of Dh, vol II. P 1235. The ते आ VI. 1 reads three verses respectively applicable to ब्राह्मण, क्षत्रिय or वैश्य departed person as'सुवर्ण हस्ताददाना, धनुर्हस्तादा, मणिं हस्तादाददाना' and पौ पि सू I 83-5 cites them and remarks 'अथास्य सुवर्णेन हस्तौ निमृजते स्वर्णे हस्ता. इति ब्राह्मणस्य, धनुर्हस्ता. इति क्षत्रियस्य' &c.

[^475]: X 18.10 Vide the passage from ĀŚv Sr S where this and the following three verses are stated to be among the 24 verses to be recited on the death of a _diksıta_ The Aśv gr 4 5 5 employs this as a _mantra_ to be recited at the time of depositing in a pit the jar containing the burnt bones of the dead. The बृहद्देवता (VII 17–18) says that X 18 10-13 are employed in the rite of collecting the bones.

[^476]: X 18. 11. This verse is employed by the Asv gr 4.5 6 for recital at the time of scattering dust over the jar containing the charred
bones.

[^477]: X. 18. 12. This is recited after the bones are covered with particles of dust. It is probable that the particles were poetically described as posts.

[^478]: X 18 13. It looks very likely that a wooden post was employed as a support for the urn that was deposited under ground.

[^479]: X. 18. 14. This verse is rather obscure and various interpretations have been proposed by German scholars (Roth, Grassmann, Ludwig, Geldner and Oldenberg) and others like Whitney and Hopkins. The translation is only tentative, but it probably brings out the sense in the context much better than many other interpretations. The idea probably is that the speaker wants to disconnect himself from the dead just as a feather may become loosened from an arrow that is shot and therefore he states that he wants to stop addressing the dead and close up all connection with the dead. The Bṛhaddevata (VII. 18-19) remarks on this verse 'प्रतीचीने यथाहानि अपहृत्येतराणि तु । अहःमु पितरो वधुरित्याशास्तेऽन्त्ययाशिषः॥


It should be noted that the word 'pitṛ-yajña' actually occurs in Ṛg. X. 16. 10. What does it mean? It has to be remembered that the hymns Ṛg. X. 15-18 refer to rites immediately on the death of a single person. They are not concerned with rites performed for deceased male ancestors long after their deaths. The anxiety (in X. 15-18) seems to be to make the ancient pitṛs (styled Barhisadaḥ and Agnisvāttāḥ in Ṛg. X. 15. 3-4, 11) favourably disposed to the recently departed spirit. _Havis_ (sacrifical food such as boiled rice) was offered to the ancient pitṛs (Ṛg. X 15, 11) who were supposed to have partaken of the food offered (X. 15. 12). The purpose of these Ṛgvedic hymns is entirely different from the purpose of the mantras in Tai, S. I, 8.5 (which refer to the pitṛyajña performed in Sākamedha). As a matter of fact three of the mantras in Tai. S. I. 8.5 do occur in Ṛg. X. 57. 3.5 and are employed in the piṇḍa-pitṛyajña. There is hardly any reason to suppose that the pitṛyajña in Ṛg. X. 15. 10 is more ancient than the piṇḍapitṛyajña, It is quite possible that both referring as they do to different matters were coeval.

It would be interesting to see how the ceremonies on the death of an _āhitāgni_ are described in the śrauta and grhya sūtras. The Aśv. Sr. S. VI. 10 describes what is to be done in case one that has undergone a _dīkṣā_ (initiation) for a Soma sacrifice or a sattra dies before the sacrifice is finished. It states "When the _diksita_ is dead, they take out the body by the _tīrtha_,[^480] place it on the spot where it was intended that _avabhṛtha_ (bath at the end of a soma or sattra sacrifice) was to be taken and deck the body with the decorations that ordinarily are placed on a dead body. They cut the hair (on the head) of the corpse, the hair on the lips, the hair on the body and also pare the nails. They apply paste of _Nalada_ (Indian spikenard) to the corpse and throw on it a garland of _naladas_. Some (having cut open the entrails) take out the fecal matter from them and fill them with prsadājya ( when clarified butter is mixed with curds it is so called ). They cut off a portion as wide as the foot of the corpse from a new ( unworn ) garment and cover the dead body with it in such a way that the fringe is towards the  west (the head being placed towards the east) and the feet of the corpse are exposed to view. The portion cut off from the piece of cloth is taken by the sons and the like. The deceased man's _śrauta_ fires are placed on the churning sticks.( the two _avanis_), the dead body is taken outside the _vedi_ (fire altar) towards its south, fire is produced by attrition and then the body is burnt therewith. After returning from the cremation, they should finish the work of the day. On the next morning, the recitation of the śāstras, the singing of the stotras and the samstavas (reciting hymns in chorus) should be without repetition and the utturing of the _him_ sound. On the same day before taking up the _grahas_ (cups), the priests come out by the tirtha, go round the place of cremation with the right hand turned away (from the place ) and sit round it in the following manner viz. the hotr priest sits to the west ( of the place of cremation ), the adhvaryu to the north, and the sāma priests to the west of the adhvaryu (and the brahmā priest to the south). Then the Sāma priests sing in a low voice the verse beginning with "āyam gauh prśnirakramīt' When the singing is finished the hotr walks round the place of cremation thrice with his left turned towards the place of cremation and without uttering the syllable 'om' recites immediately after the song of the sāma priests the stotriya in a low voice and also the following verses attributed to Yama and Yāmyāyanas (as seers or authors) viz. Ṛg x 14. 7-8, 10-11, X. 16. 1-6, x. 17. 3-6, X. 18. 10-13,X, 154.1-5. They should finish with Ṛg..X. 14.12, then collect the charred bones in a jar, take the jar by the way of the tīrtha and place it on the seat that was occupied by the deceased sacrificer[^481].

[^480]:  तीर्थ means the path to the sacrificial ground between the चात्वाल and उत्कर (vide H, of Db vol. II P 984) For स्तोत्रिय that occurs a little lower down, vide H, of Dh, vol. II p. 1186.

[^481]: संस्थिते तीर्थेन निहत्यावभृथे प्रेतालङ्कारान् कुर्वन्ति । केशश्मनुलोमनखामि वापयन्ति। नलदेनानुलिम्पन्ति। नलदमालां प्रतिमुञ्चन्ति । निष्पुरीषमेके कृत्वा पृषदाज्य पूरयन्ति। अहतस्य वासस पाशत. पादमात्रमवच्छिद्य प्रोर्णुवन्ति प्रत्यग्दशेनावि पादम् । अवच्छेदमस्य पुत्रा अमा कुर्वीरन अग्नीनस्य समारोप्य दक्षिणतो बहिर्वेदि दहेयुः ।...प्रत्येत्याह. समापयेयुः। प्रातरनम्यासमनभिहिङ्कृतानि शस्त्रानुवचनाभिष्टवनसंस्तवानि । पुरा ग्रहग्रहणात् तीर्थेन निष्क्रम्य त्रिःप्रसव्यमायतनं परीत्य पर्युपविशन्ति। पश्वाद्धोता। उत्तरोघ्वर्युः । तस्य पश्चाच्छन्दोगा.। आयं गौः पृश्निरक्रमादित्युपाशु स्तुवते। स्तुते होता प्रसन्यमायतनं परिव्रजन्स्तोत्रियमनु द्रवेदप्रणुवन् । यामीश्च । प्रेहि प्रेहि पथिभिः पूर्व्येभिरिति पञ्चाना तृतीयामुद्धरेत् । मैनमग्ने विदहो माभिशोच इति षट् । पूपा त्वेतप्रक्ष्यावयतु प्रविद्वानिति चतस्र उपसर्पमातरं भूमिमेतामिति चतस्र. सोम एकेभ्यः । उरुणसा उदुम्बलाविति च समाप्य सञ्चित्य तीर्थेन प्रपाद्य यथासनमासादयेयु। आश्व. श्री 10.

The Sat. Br. (XII, 5 2.5) refers to the practice of cleansing the deceased of all foul matter, but does not approve of it. It recommends
'having washed him out inside he anoints with ghee and thus makes the body sacrificially pure' आयं गौः पृश्निरक्रमीत-is the first verse of the hymn Ṛg.x.189. 1-3 which are also S.V. No. 630-632 (Āranyakānda) and 1376-78 (Uttarārcika). The hymn also occurs in the other Vedas. The verses are called सार्वराञ्य ऋचः. It may be noticed that the Aśv.gr. (IV.46) prescribes the recitation of the 24 mantras prescribed in the Aśv Sr. above and employs some more verses (from Ṛg x. 14-18) in the ritual set out below from the Āśv. gr. In the Aśv Sr, II, 19 there is a description of a rite called 'pitṛyā karma,' in which offerings are offered in fire taken from the Daksiṇāgni and in which the _devatās_ are five viz. Pitarah-somavantaḥ, Soma pitṛmān, Pitaraḥ barhıṣadah, Pıtaraḥ Agnisvāttāḥ, Yama, for each of whom three verses are recited respectively in order viz Ṛg. X. 15. 1, IX.9611,x15.5, Ṛg 191.1,19112. VIII. 48 13,x.15.4.x 153.x. 15,2: x.15.11,x 1513,४. 15.143 X. 14.4-5, x. 14 1. Ṛg.x,1612 (repeated thrice) becomes the sāmidhenis in that rite, X, 14 5 15 Yājyā and X 14,4 and x 14.1 are anuvālyās, Ṛg. x. 159, IV 113, 1 96.1 are recited when the rite is finished (instead of Agni Sviṣṭakṛt Agni Kavyavāhana is invoked); Rs. 3. 16 11,x. 15.12 are two Samyājyās in Vasaṭkāra. The editor of the Prayogaratna explains that Nalada means "Uśira' (i.e wālā in Marathi) and that some substitute japā flowers (china rose) for _naladas_.


The Saṅkhāyana Śr. S. (IV. 14-15) deals at great length with the death of an _āhitāgni_ and the rites that follow. Kāt. Sr. [Vol. S. 25.7 does the same but more briefly. Kāt. (25.7.18) refers to the cutting of hair and nails and taking out fecal matter and Kaus. (80. 13-16), Śān, Śr. 4.14 4-5 also speak of the cutting of hair, of bathing the dead body, applying paste and putting garlands. The Baud. P, S (1 2) refers to these and adds that if they cut open his entrails from the right side they again sew it with darbha grass or they may simply wash the body (without taking out the fecal matter ), cover the body with a piece of cloth, deck it, remove the body by the way between the _vedi_ and _utkara_, place it on a couch (_āsandi_) over which a black antelope skin was spread with the head to the south, put Nalada garland on it and cover it with an unworn piece of cloth (as in ĀŚv. Śr, above ). Sat śr. 28 1. 22 and G. P. S. 1. 10-14 contain similar provisions adding that the toes of the feet and thumbs of the corpse are tied with a white thread of the fringe of a garment (baddhvā daśenāṇgusthau-pādayoh pānyośca, G. P. S. I 12 ) and that the _āsandi_ ( a small couch or chair on which the corpse was carried ) was to be of _udumbara_ wood. The Kauśikasūtra (80, 3, 3-45) refers to numerous stanzas from À V. that are to be recited in kindling the funeral fire and offering oblations, viz. 18. 2. 4 and 36, 18, 3, 4; 18. 1. 49-50, 58; 18. 1. 41-43; 7. 68 1-2; 18. 3. 25; 18.2 4-18 (omitting 18.2.10); 18.4.1-15 &c. Compare SBE VO), XI p. XLI for Budhist practice.

The Aśv. gr. [^482] (IV.1 and 2) prescribes in general the ceremonies on the death of an _āhitāgni_, while the Āśv. Sr. S. quoted above deals with what should be done in case the _āhitāgni_ dies while engaged in a Soma or other sacrifice. The Aśv. gr. remarks 'when an _āhitāgni_ dies, one (a son or other relative) should arrange to have a piece of land dug up to the south-east or south-west at a place sloping towards the south or south-east, or according to some towards the south-west. The piece of land dug up should be of the length of a man with upraised arms, of the breadth of one _vyāma_[^483] and one _vitasti_ (twelve finger breadths) in depth. The cemetery (śmaśāna) should[^484] be free (open) on all sides. It should abound in herbs, but plants with thorns and with milky juice (should be dug out) as stated before (in Aśv. gr. IL 7.5 about Vāstu-parikśā). From which the waters flow on all sides (that is the spot should be a little higher than the surrounding ground); this should be a characteristic required for that (kind of) cemetery where (the body) is to be burnt. They should cut off the hair on the head, the lips and the body and pare the nails (of the deceased); this has been declared already (in Āśv, Śr. VI. 10.2). They should make provision for plenty of sacrificial grass and clarified butter. In this (funeral rite) they pour clarified butter into curds. This is the _prṣadājya_ used (in the rites) for pitṛs. The relatives of the deceased) carry his sacred fires and his sacrificial Vessels in that direction (viz, where the ground is dug up for cremation). After these aged persons, in odd numbers, men and women not going together, carry the dead body. Some say that (the dead body) should be carried in a cart with a seat drawn[^485] by oxen. Some prescriba that a she-animal, either a cow[^486] or a she-goat, of one colour or of a dark colour (should be taken to the cemetery). The (relatives of the dead) tie (a rope) to the left fore-foot and lead it behind (the corpse). Then follow the relations (of the deceased) with their yajñopavitas brought low (round their body) and with the top knot untied ( dishevelled ), the older ones going first, the younger ones last. Having thus arrived at the spot (of cremation ), the performer (of cremation rites ) while walking three times round the spot (for cremation) with his left side turned towards it, sprinkles water on it with a _śami_ twig with the verse 'apeta vita vi ca sarpatātah' (Ṛg. X, 14. 9). To the south-east on a slightly raised corner (of the spot for cremation ), he ( son or the like ) places the Āhavaniya fire, to the north-west the Gārhapatya fire and to the south-west the Dakśiṇa fire. Then a person that knows how to prepare a funeral pile) collects a pile of fuel between the fires (on the dug-up spot). Then the performer of the rites spreads _barhis_ (_kuśas_) and a black antelope skin with the hairy part outside on the pile, ( the relatives ) place the dead body thereon carrying it by way of the north side of the Gārhapatya fire and turning its head towards the Ahavaniya fire. They make the wife of the deceased (belonging to any one of the three higher Varṇas) lie down (on the pile) to the north of the dead body, and also place his bow to the north if (the deceased-was) a kśatriya. The wife's brother-in-law[^487] (husband's brother) or a representative of the husband or a pupil (of the deceased) or an old servant (slave) should make her rise (from the pile) with the mantra 'udirsva nāryabhi jiyalokam' (Ṛg. X, 18. 8); the performer (of the rites) should mutter this verse if a śūdra (servant) makes her rise and he takes away the bow with the Verse 'dhanur-hastādādadāno' (Ṛg. X. 18. 9). It has been stated (above what is to be done) in case a śūdra (should perform this act). Having strung the bow he should before the piling up of the things (mentioned below on the dead body) is done, break the bow to pieces and throw it on the pile[^488]. He then should put the following sacrificial implements (on the dead body ) viz. into the right hand the spoon called Juhū, in the left hand the spoon Upabhrt, on his right side the Sphya (wooden sword), on his left side the Agnihotrahavani (the ladle with which the Agnihotra offerings were offered into fire), on his chest, head and teeth respectively the dhruvā (the big sacrificial ladle), the dishes (or the _kapālas_ ), the pressing stones (used for pressing out Soma juice in a soma sacrifice), on the two nostrils the two small ladles (_sruva_), on the ears the two Prāśitra-haranas, [^489] if there be only one then breaking it into two; on the belly the _pātri_ (in which the oblations are collected before offering) and the _camasa_ (cup) in which the _iḍā_ portion) cut off is placed; on his private parts the śamyā, on the thighs the two aranis (wood sticks for kindling fire by attrition) and on the spanks the nortar and pestle, on the feet the winnowing baskets (śūrpa) or if there be one only, by tearing it in two pieces. Those of the sacrificial implements which have a hollow (into which a fluid can be poured) are filled with _Prṣadājya_. The son of the deceased) should take the upper and the lower mill-stones for himself and the implements made of copper, iron and earthenware[^490].


[^482]: It deserves to be noted that the numbering of the sūtras in Aśv. gr. IV, 1-2 differs in different editions considerably. The rules about the selection of the site for cremation are ancient. The Sat Br. XIII. 8,1 and Kat. Sr XXI. 3,15-26 also lay down elaborate rules. The latter may be set out here. 'the site for cremation should be one surrounded by a thicket of trees, but it should be so open that the sun shines directly on it at mid-day. It should be saltish land or land sloping to the north or it may be all level land. Some say that it should slope towards the south. The spot should be such that the houses in the village cannot be seen from it and should be at a distance from the road and from the vata, pippala, tilvaka, haridru, sphūrjaka, bibhidaka and other trees that have an evil name (such as ślesmātaka and kovidāra) The 'Sat, Br. XIII 8.1.16 names all those trees that are to be avoided. The spot should be such that a pile of wood (as directed in Kāt. St. 25 7 16-17) can be constructed thereon. It should be a pleasing one and should have a thicket of various trees to its west or in default, water, which may be to its west or north. The spot should have streams or holes and grass growing thereon. The Kat Sr. S. 21 3. 27 adds that a bamboo staff with a bundle of grass at its top is carried to the cremation ground and held by a person to the north of the ground while the rites go on and that it is brought back to the house and kept raised at the house. The ground is measured and pegs of palaśa, śami, varana and a stone are driven into the ground from the east, north, west and south in order. The Sat. Br. XIII. 8. 4,1 mentions pegs (_śanku_), Sān. Sr. (IV, 14, 6-9) states that the ground of cremation slopes to the south or south-east, that the ground is swept with a palāśa branch with the verse 'apeta' (Ṛg. X. 14. 9), then it is cleared with the _sphya_ and sprinkled with water and the pile of wood is made to face south-east.

[^483]:  व्याम is defined as 'व्यामो बाह्वोः सकरयोस्ततयोस्तिर्यगन्तरम्'  अमरकोश. It is as much as the out-stretched arms together with the hands (i.e, a fathom).

[^484]: श्मशान has two meanings viz. the place where a corpse is cremated and also the place where the charred bones (after cremation) collected in a jar are deposited in the earth. नारायण remarks on आश्व. गृ. IV. 1.11 (अभित आकाशं श्मशानं) 'श्मशानग्रहणेनात्र श्मशानद्वयं गृह्यते । ..दहनदेशश्व श्मशानं 'सञ्चित्य यत्रास्थानि निधीयन्ते तच्च श्मशानम् । तट्द्वयं सर्वतआकाशं भवेत् '. The शतपथवा . XIII 8.1.1 derives श्मशान in two ways as being a form of शवान्न or श्मशान्न in the words अथास्मै कल्याणं कुर्वन्ति। अथास्मै श्मशान कुर्वन्ति। श्मशा उ हैव माम पितॄणामत्तारस्ते हामुष्मिँल्लोकेऽकृतश्मशानस्य साधुकृत्यामुपदम्भयन्ति तेभ्य एतदन्नं करोति तस्माच्छ्भ्शास्त्रं श्मशानं ह वै तच्छ्स्शानमित्याचक्षते परोक्षम् । अथर्व 18 4 44 shows that the dead body was carried in a cart drawn by oxen.

[^485]: The Baud, P, S, (1, 4,5-6) says that servants or old men should carry the dead body on a couch or chair covering the body with a mat or according to some in a cart.

[^486]:अनुस्तरणी is a cow or she-goat which is killed and then is made to cover the dead body with its limbs. The word is explained by नारायण as 'प्रेतमसुस्तर्यते या स्त्री पशु सानुस्तरणी'. कात्यायनश्रौत  (25.7.34-37) 'अनुस्तरणी चेत्पश्चारकर्णमाहत्य हस्तयोर्वृक्कौ। अङ्गेण्वङाानीति जातुकर्ण्यः । न वास्ति सम्देहात् । वपया सुखमवच्छायाग्निभिरादीपग्रति । आहुतिं जुहोति पुत्रो भ्रातान्योवा ब्राह्मणोऽस्मत्वमाधिजातोऽसि 'त्वदयं जायता पुन. असो स्वर्गाय लोकाय स्वाहेति। The mantra अस्मात्त.. लोकाय स्वाहां is वाज सं 35 22 Vide शतपथ व्रा XII, 5 2 15 for the same words and mantra as in Kāt Sr. The com of Yājāskadeva on Kāt. Sr. 25 7 34 explains वृक्कौ as कुक्षिगोलकौ Vide also Baud. P, S 1 4 1 and I 9-10, Sat. St 28.2 3-13, Kaus 81.20-27. The latter prescribes that the cow is led round with the left side towards the corpse with the mantras A V 18 3 3 and 4, that the cow is struck on her buttocks and loins, that two vrkkau are taken from the cow's back and placed on the hands of the corpse with the mantra 'ati drava' (A V. XVIII 2 11 ) which is Ṛg. X 14 10.

[^487]: Many of the sūtras refer to this act of making the wife of the deceased lie down to the north of the dead body on the funeral pile and then making her rise up from it. Vide Kauśikasūtra 80, 44-45 'इयं नारीति पत्नीमुपसंवेशयति । उदीर्ण्वेत्युत्थपयति' These two verses are A. V. XVIII, 3, 1-2. Sat Sr. (28. 2. 14-16) states that before the corpse is placed on the pyre the wife is made to lie down near it with the verse 'iyam nāri' and then her husband's brother or another brāhmaṇa makes her get up with the verse 'udirsva nāri'. The same sūtra (28. 2. 22) says that the wife may be made to lie down near the corpse after the latter is placed on the pyre or before (as it appears to prefer).

[^488]: Here the Sat. Br. XII 5.2.6 and some of the sūtras (such as Kāt, Sr. 25.7. 19, Sān. Ś1. IV. 14. 16-35, Sat śr. 28. 2. 23-50, Kauśika 81. 1-19, Baud P, S I, 8-9) and smṛtis like Gobhila (III 24) add that in the seven seats of vital air viz. the mouth, the two nostrils, the two eyes and the two ears, they cast small pieces of gold. Others add that sesame wetted with ghee are also thrown on the corpse. The G. P S. 11, 7 12 says that it is the adhvaryu who deposits the kapālas on the head (of the dead body).

[^489]: On the Praśitraharana, vide H, of Dh vol II, p 1064 (the vessel in which a portion of purodāśa is kept for the brahmā priest). For the Samyā (yole-pin), vide H. of Dh vol. II, p. 1112 n. 2487.

[^490]: It should be noted that there are some variations in the statements about the sacrificial implements made here and in the Sat Br. XII. 5. 2, Sat Sr, 28. 2 23-50, Kat Sr 25 7 21-33, Kaus. 81 1-19, Baud. P. S. 1, 8 11-1.9 7, sāo śr. IV 14, 18-36. For example, the Sāo Sr. (IV. 16 21-31) prescribes that the Agnihotrahavani is placed on the throat and the two aranīs on the private parts, while Aśv. gr. places the Agnihotrahavani on the left side and the śamyā on private parts. Sabara quotes several times a passage which says "They burn the āhitāgni with his (vedic) fires and sacrificial implements' (āhitāgnim-agnibhır dahantı yajñapātraśca) on Jai IV 1 9, VI, 6 34, XI 3.34. Those words occur also in Baud P. S. III 1.9 Jai XI 3 34 states the proposition that the cremation of the sacrificer with the sacrificial implements is what is called _pratipattikarman_ (the final disposal) of the yajñapātras.


The Śat. Br. XII. 5. 14 first states that sacrificial implements made of stone or earthenware should be donated to a brāhmana but people regard the latter as a corpse-bearer (and so) they should be thrown into water[^491]. Taking out the omentum (_vapā_) of the Anustarani she-animal he should cover therewith the head and the mouth (of the deceased) with the Verse 'Agner Varma' (Ṛg. X, 16. y). Taking out the two kidneys (vrkkau) of the animal he should deposit them into the hands of the deceased) the right kidney in the right hand and left kidney in the left with the mantra 'ati drava'(Ṛg X. 14, 10, recited once only). He puts the heart (of the animal) on his heart and according to some also two lumps of flour (of rice or barley ); according to others only if there are no kidneys[^492]. Having deposited the whole animal limb by limb (on corresponding limbs of the dead body) and having covered it with its own hide he recites when the Pranitā water is being carried forward, by way of invocation the mantra 'imam agne' (Ṛg. X. 16. 8). Bending his left knee he should offer into the Dakśina fire oblations of clarified butter with the formula 'to Agni svāhā! To Soma svāhā! To the world spāhā! To Anumati svāhā!' A fifth oblation (is to be offered ) on the chest of the deceased with the formula 'from this one, indeed thou hast been born! May he now be born out of thee, N. N.| To the heavenly world, svāhā' (Vāj s. 35. 22 ). He gives the order 'Light the fire together.' Then the Aśv. gr. (IV, 4. 2-5) states what one has to understand if the Āhavanīya or Gārhapatya or Dakśina fire reaches the dead body first or if all the fires reach the body at the same moment; while the body is burning he recites over it the same texts (Ṛg. X 14, 7 and others quoted above in n. 481 from Aśv. Sr. sūtra ). Being cremated by a person who knows this he goes to the heavenly world together - with the smoke (of the funeral pile)--thus it is known (in the Śruti). After he has, recited the verse 'ime jīvāh' (Ṛg. X, 18.3) they (all relatives) turn round from right to left and go away without looking back. When they have come to a place where there is standing water, having once plunged into it and raised their heads out of it they pour one handful of water, pronounce the gotra name and the proper name (of the deceased), come out (of the water), put on other garments, wring out (already worn garments) once, lay them away with their skirts to the north and sit down until the stars appear or they may enter their houses when a part of the Sun's disc is still visible, the younger ones entering first, the older ones last. When they have come to the houses they touch a stone, the fire, cow-dung, fried barley, sesame seeds and water. Compare Sat. Br. XIIL 8, 4. 5 for bath and offering of water by relatives and touching a bull on returning from cremation and reciting 'udvayam' (Vaj. S 35. 14 = Ṛg. I 50. 10) and applying collyrium and unguent to their bodies[^493].

XII. 5 2 6-8 The गौ.पि.सू I 2.31, Sat Sr. 28.2 23-4 and others provide that either gold bits or drops of clarified butter were to be cast over the seven orifices (mouth and others). A comparatively later smṛti like that of Parāśara mentions this depositing of sacrificial implements on the sacrificer's body (V. 19-22)

[^492]: According to Kat. Sr. quoted above in n. 486 the Anustarani animal was to be struck behind the ear and killed. According to Jätükarnya the several limbs of the animal were to be placed on the corresponding limbs of the dead body. But Kat. disapproves of this since when burnt there may be a doubt (in collecting bones) whether they are of the deceased or of the animal (and so only the flesh of the animal was to be placed on the limbs according to Kāt.). Compare Sat. Br. XII. 5. 9-12 for similar remarks. Ašv. 81. IV. 2.4 (as interpreted by Nārāyana) itself shows that there was an option) viz, that the animal may be killed or let off and donated to a brāhmaṇa (vide also Baud. P. S. I. 10. 2). The San. Sr. (IV. 14. 14-15) stated that the kidneys were to be taken from the killed or living animal from behind and being slightly heated on the Dakśina fire were to be placed in the two hands of the deceased with the two mantras 'ati drava' (Rg. X. 14. 10-11).

It is not possible from considerations of space to set out all that is said in the other gṛhya sūtras. A few interesting points may be noted here. The Sat Br XII. 8. 4, 11, Par. gr. (IIL 10. 10 ff) expressly provide that funeral rites for any one whose upanayana has been performed are the same from the choosing of the site for the burning of the body to the descent into water on the part of the relatives (for bathing themselves ) as those prescribed for a person who has set up the srauta (Vedic) fires, the only difference being that an _āhitāgni_ is cremated with the three Vedic fires kept by him, that one who has kept only the smārta[^494] or aupāsana fire is burnt with that and that common persons who have neither kept the śrauta fires nor smārta fire are burnt with the ordinary[^495] fire. Devala provides that when using ordinary fire, one should avoid taking the fire from a cāndāla or any unclean fire or the fire in the room of a freshly delivered woman or the fire of a _patita_ or fire from a funeral pyre[^496]. Tho pitṛdayıtā states that the mantra 'asmāt tvam &c' was not to be recited when the deceased was a person who had not kept sacred fires[^497]. The Pār, gr, further provides that all relatives residing in the same village, if they can trace the relationship, do the same, that they wear only one garment, suspend their sacred thread over the right shoulder, that with the fourth finger of the left hand they spurt away the water with Vāj. S 35.6 and facing the south plunge into water and pour out one libation of water with joined hands. The Āp. Dh. S, (TI. 6. 15, 2-7) lays down a bath when a person's relatives On the mother's side and father's relatives up to the 7th degree or as long as relationship can be traced die, except in the case of children less than a year old. In the case of a child's death before one year, the parents and those who carry the child's body have to bathe. All the above should have dishevelled hair, should throw dust in the hair, wear only one garment, turn their faces to the south, plunge into water, offer water to the dead thrice and then sit down on the bank (of the river or pond), then come to the village and do what the women tell them to do (such as touching fire and bull &c.). Yāj, III 2 also provides the same rules as Pās. gr, and prescribes the recitation of the mantra 'apa nah sośucad agham' (May evil be burnt away from us,' Ṛg. I. 97 1, A.V. IV. 331, Tai, Ā, VI 10.1). The G P, S, (II, 23) provides that the funeral pyre is to be made with the wood of sacrificial trees, (II. 37 and 39) that the sapinḍas of the deceased headed by the women, the youngest being the first, fan the corpse placed on the pyre with the fringes of their garments, that the performer of the funeral rites takes a jar filled with water, places a _darbhendva_ (?) on his head and goes round the corpse thrice and the priest gives a light stroke on the jar -thrice separately with a stone (_aśman_) or an axe and recites a mantra 'imā āpo &c.' when a stream of water rushes out of the broken jar, (changing the words about ‘asmin loke' to 'antarikśe' and 'svarge' at the 2nd and 3rd perambulations). The performer while standing should drop behind him the jar of water. Then after repeating the mantra 'tasmāt tvam adhijātosi...asau svargāya lokāya svāhā,' he should set fire to the pyre to burn the body[^498]. The Sat Śr 28 1 38 provides that the family members beat their right thighs, fan the corpse with the fringes of their garments and go thrice round the corpse with the left side towards the corpse and recite the _mantra_ 'apa nah sośucad agham' (Ṛg. I 97 1. Tai. Ā, VI 10.1). It further provides (28, 1 37-46) that the corpse is carried in a cart or by (four) men and while being carried four stops are made, at each of which clods of earth are dug up and boiled rice is offered thereon with mantras like 'pūsā tvetah' (Ṛg. X. 17 3., Tai Ā VI, 10 1), "āyur visvāyur" (Ṛg. X. 17. 4, Tai. Ā VI 10.2). The Varāhapurāna prescribes that a Paurānic mantra should be recited, that the performer should go round the pyre and apply the kindled fire towards the part of the pyre where the head is placed[^499].

## Antyeṣṭi in modern times

In modern times the procedure of cremation is generally on the lines of that described in the Aśv. gr, cited above and the procedure described in the Garuḍapurāṇa II, 4, 41 ff. The following is a summary of the procedure set out in the Antyeṣṭipaddhati of Narāyanabhatta which is generally followed by Ṛgvedins in Western India. The dead body is washed with water, is decked with a _tilaka_ on the forehead, is clothed in a garment, is covered with a paste of Jatāmāmsi and a garland of _naladas_ is placed round its neck. Then the performer washes his own feet, sips water, performs prāṇāyāma without Vedic mantra, then makes a _Saṅkalpa_ (as in note 500 ),[^500] he wears his sacred thread under the left shoulder (and on the right shoulder) and prays to the earth with the mantra 'upasarpa' (Ṛg. X. 18.10), he then thrice goes round the place dug up (for cremation) and sprinkles water with a śami branch at the end of the mantra 'apeta' ( Ṛg. X. 14. 9). This mantra is repeated thrice. Then, he draws three lines on the ground with an iron piece or kuśa roots saying 'I draw a line for Yama, the lord of cremation', 'I draw a line for Kāla, lord of &c' 'I draw a line for Mṛtyu, lord of &c'. Then he throws into the dug-up ground pieces of gold and sesame and water mixed with sesame in the middle of the dug up spot for Yama, to the north for Kāla and to the south for Mṛtyu (each being associated with pitṛs, the formula being ' Yamāya dahanapataye pitṛsbhyaḥ svadhā namaḥ'). He puts sesame in the mouth of the corpse and prepares a funeral pile sufficient for burning the body by means of sacrificial wood brought by the castemen of the deceased. On that pile he spreads kuśa grass and over the latter black antelope skin with the hair outside. Then the corpse is carried to the north of the fire and is placed on the funeral pile with the head to the south. To the north of the dead body, he makes the wife of the deceased sit down. Then the husband's brother, pupil or an old servant makes her get up with the mantra 'udīrsva' (Ṛg. X. 18. 8). Then the performer puts pieces of gold in the seven holes of the body (vide above note 491) or drops of clarified butter. He then throws on the body of the departed sesame anointed with ghee, he performs _parısamūhana_ (wiping with the wet hand) of the fire, then _paristarana_ (strewing darbha grass) round the fire together with the funeral pile) and paryuksana (sprinkling water) and brings to the south of the fire the vessels viz proksani, sruva, camasa and the vessel containing clarified butter. Then he puts water in the _camasa_ (cup), covers it with darbha grass and carries it forward and invokes the camasa with Ṛg. X. 16.8 (imam-agne &c). He makes a _saṅkalpa_ that he would wait upon (or worship) the dead, takes two fuel sticks and offers them into fire and performs the worship of Agni, Kāma, Loka and Anumati by offering clarified butter in fire with the appropriate formula (viz. agnaye svāhā, agnaya idam na mama). Then he offers on the chest of the deceased clarified butter (or prṣadājya) (according to some) with the mantra 'asmādvai &c. (vide above note 498). Then he prepares apūpas (balls) with barley flour and mixes them with _prṣadājya_ and places portions of the balls on the five parts viz. forehead, mouth, the two arms and chest with the following mantras viz Ṛg X. 16. 7 (for the ball on forehead and mouth), Ṛg X. 14, 10 (for the two arms) and Ṛg. X 14. 11 (for the chest). Then he makes the fire flame up with the mantra Ṛg. X. 16 9 (kravyādam-agnim) towards the head of a male (and the feet of a woman). Then he should repeat certain mantras while the body is being burnt viz. Ṛg. X, 14,7-8, Ṛg. X. 14. 10–11, Ṛg. X. 16.1-6, X 17.3-6. X. 18. 10–13, X, 154, 1-5, X. 14. 12 While muttering these mantras he should throw sesame on the body that is being burnt. Then the performer should take a jar (full of water) on his left shoulder, should make a hole in it on the back of the jar with a broken but smooth stone. He should go round thrice with the left towards the burning body from the spot where the feet of the corpse lie and mutter certain mantras. The jar is struck thrice. ALL the _sagotra_ relatives go round the burning corpse. Then the jar is completely broken near that part of the funeral pyre where the head rests. The relatives without looking back turn to the left and come out of the cemetery with the youngest members first. The performer recites Ṛg 18 3 (ime jīvā &c ). The relatives repair to a spot where water is flowing, wearing only one garment and with faces to the south and hair dishevelled, plunge into the water once, sip water, place on the bank that stone (_aśman_) with which holes were made in the jar, offer water mixed with sesame on that stone with folded hands with the words 'O departed, of such a gotra and of such a name! May this water mixed with sesame reach you'. The performer offers water with the uttariya for allaying the thirst (of the departed) due to the burning.

Many rules were prescribed as regards the carrying of the dead body. It has been seen above that the corpse was carried in a cart or on a couch by the relatives or by the ser yants (dāsas). Some sūtras, spirtis, commentaries and other works lay down many other rules hera The Rāmāyaṇa (Ayodhya 76. 13 ff) states that on the death of Dasaratha his Vedic fires were carried by his priests before the corpse, that the dead body was placed in & palanquin (Sibika), that his servants carried it and that coins of gold and clothes vora thrown about on the road in front of the bier (for the pour), The general rule was that members of the three higaer vardas alone should carry to the cemetery a dead body belonging to any one of those vargas and a śūdra should not carry the dead body of a man of a higher casto (when there vore mon of the caste of the dead available) nor should a man of one of the threa higher varṇas carry the dead body of a sudra, in that the impurity in the case of a sūdra carrying a 1840 dvijātı or a duzzati carrying a sūdra's body is determinou by the caste of the dead man, Vida Visau Dh S 19 1-4, Gaut, Dh. S. 14 29, Manu 5 104. Yai H 26. Parāśara IL 43-45. A brahmacarin was not permitted to be a carrier of the dead body of a person or relative even of his owo caste, excapt Dis parents, guru, ācārya and upādhyāya and he was not guilty of breaking his yovs of student-hood if he carried the bodies of any one of the five mentioned above. Vide Vas 23. 7, Manu 5. 91, Yāj III 15, Laghu-Harita 92-93, BrahmapurāD& (g by Par. M. I. % g. 278). Guru, ācārya and Upadhyāya are definod

Rules about carrying a corpse

215

by Yaj. I 34-35. If a brahmacārin carried the corpse of any one except the above five he was held to have swerved from his vrata and he had to undeṚgo the expiation for trafalopa, Manu 5, 103 and Yāj. II 13-14 state that those who merely carry a dead body of their own caste should bathe with the clothes on, then bite off nimba leaves, should perform acamana, touch fire, water, cowdung, white mustard, place slowly a foot on a stone and then enter their house It being the duty of sapindas 501 to carry the dead body of their relative they, after doing so, had simply to bathe, to touch fire and drink clarified butter for being pure (Gaut. 14, 29. Yāj. IL. 26, Manu IV. 103. Parāśara II. 42, Devala q. by Par. M. 1 %, p. 277, Harīta q. by Aparārka p. 871). Carrying the dead body of a brāhmaga who has no relatives is highly extolled by Parāśara (III 39-41) who says that a person, that thus carries the dead body of a brāh mapa, secures at each footstep the reward of the performance of a sacrifice and he becomes pure at oncs simply by plunging into water and performing prādāyāma, while Manu (5. 101–102) prescribes that if one carries the dead body of a person who is not a sapında through affection he becomes pure after three days. The Hāralatā p. 121 quotes the Adipurāda that if a ksatriya or vaisya cremates the dead body of a poor brāhmaṇṇa or of a ksatriya who has lost everything or of a poor Faiśya, he secures great merit and becomes pure at once after a bath. Even now generally (particularly in villages) men of the same caste carry or follow a dead body and are held to be purified by a bath with clothes on. The medieval commentaries like the Mitakṣarā stuck strictly to the extreme exclusiveness of caste by prescribing 'if a man sua carries a dead body through affection, eats food in that family and dwells in their house he is under impurity for ten days; if he simply stays with the dead man's family but does not eat their food he is impure for three days; these rules apply when the carrier is of

the same caste as the dead person But if a brāhmana carries a Śūdra's corpse, the brāhmana is impure for a month, but if & Śūdra carries a brāhmana's body the sūdra is impure for ten days. The Kūrmapurāda prescribes that if a brāhmana carries the dead body of a brāhmana for a fee or from other interested motive he becomes impure for ten days, a ksatriya, vaisya and sūdra doing the same becomes impure for 1%, 15 or 30 days and the Vispupurāpa says that the person carrying a dead body for a fee has to become impure for the period of impurity prescribed for a man of that caste, It may be stated that these rules about impurity on the ground of carrying or following the carrying of a dead body of another caste are no longer enforced and it is extremely doubtful whether they were ever strictly enforced or followed Harsta 503 prescribes that a dead body should not be carried through the midst of a village if wbile going to the cemetery a village comes in the way, but it should be carried away from it. Manu, 592 and Vrddha-Hārīta IX, 100-101 prescribed that the dead body of a śūdra, vaisya, ksatriya and a brāhmana was to be taken out respectively by the southern, western, Dorthern and eastern gates of the town or village It was provided by Yama and the Garuḍapurāna II 4 56-57 504 that the fuel for the funeral pyre should not be carried (for higher varṇas) to the cemetery by a sūdra and if a śūdra did so the deceased would always remain in the state of preta The Hāralatā (p 121) says that if firewood is carried by sūdras still the pyre should be made by brāhmanas only (for a brāhmapa's body). The smrtis and purāpas provide that the corpse 505 should be first bathed with water and then cremated, that the corpse should never be burned naked, but that it should be covered with cloth, decked with flowers and have fragrant unguents (sandalwood

The Brahmapurāpa (q. by Suddhiprakaśa p. 159) states that when carrying a dead body to the cemetery, a great deal of noise should be created by means of the four kinds of instru. ments. 506

There were differing rules laid down about rapana (shaving) for the performer as an auxiliary (anga) of the rite of cremation, after the cremation and bath thereafter. A smrti text provides 507

shaving of the head and moustaches is declared in seven cases, viz. on the Ganges, at the Bhāskaraksetra, on the death of the mother or father or guru, on consecrating the frauta fires and in a Soma sacrifice'. The A KD (p. 19) prescribes that the son or other performer of the rites of cremation should first perform vapana and thep bathe, then carry the dead body to a sacred spot, bathe it there, or if such a spot is not at hand should invoke the presence of the Ganges, Gayā and other tirthas in the water to be used for washing the dead body, then anoint it with ghee or sesame oil, again bathe it and put on it a fresh garment, should deck it with yarnopavīta, gopicandana, garland of basil leaves and then should apply to the wbole body fragrant subst. ances like sandalwood paste, camphor, saffron, musk &c. But if the cremation took place at night, there was to be no vapana at night, but on the next day.508 Other smrtis allowed vapana on the 2nd, 3rd, 5th or 7th or any following day up to the offering of śrāddha on the 11th day.509 Áp Dh, S.

provides sio zapana for all sapindas that are younger than the deceased The Madanapārijāta holds that the performer of orema. tion rites had to undergo vapana on the first day and also on the expiry of the period of impurity, while the Suddhiprakasa (p 162) following the Mit on Yāj. ITI 17 states that the day on which vapana is to be undergone is determined by the usage of each country. This difference in usages has been even judicially noticed. In Chandra choora Deo v. Brbhuti Bhushan Deva A,I R. 1945 Patna p. 211 at p. 219 it has been stated that according to the Benares School the person who performs the cremation shayes his head at the time of cremation, whereas under the Mithilā school there is no such shaving at that time.

The Garuḍapurāpa (II. 4. 67-69) provides that loud weeping may be indulged in when the body is burning but there should be no weeping after cremation and the offering of water to the departed,

There was some difference of opinion as to the offering of water (udakakriyā or udakadana) to the deceased by his sapindas and samānodaloas ĀŚy gr, quoted above (p 209) speaks of offering water once, but the Sat, Śr 28 2. 72 and others prescribe that water mixed with sesame is offered thrice with joined hands on the day of death to the deceased after reciting his gotra and name and every day thereafter up to the 11th,511 Gaut Dh. S. 14. 38, Vas. 4 12 presoribe that water should be offered by sapindas to the deceased with their faces to the south on the first, third, seventh and ninth days of death and Haradatta says that in all 75 añjalis of water were to be offered (threa on 1st day, 9 on 3rd, 30 on 7th and 33 on 9th ), but that the usage in bis country was that on the first day water was offered three times with joined hands and then one more anjali on each succeeding day from the 2nd.

Views on offering water prescribe that water and pinda were to be offered to the deceased for ten days.512 The Suddhiprakāśa (p. 202 ) quotes Terses from Gphyd-pariśista, one of which says that some declare that only ten añjalis were to be offered, some say 100 Tere to be offered and others that 55 vere to be offered and that one should follow the usage settled in one's vedic Sākha. The ĀŚv. gr. parisista 3. 4 has & similar rule in prose The Garuḍapurāna (Pretakhanda chap. 5 yerses 22-23 ) also refers to the offering of 10, 55, or 100 anjalis. Some smrtis prescribed that the number of añjalis of water were dependent on the caste of the deceased. Pracetas (q. by Mit. on Yāj. ITI. 4) provides that 10, 12, 15, 30 añjalis should be respectively offered to a deceased person of the brahmaṇa, ksatriya, vaisya or sūdra Varna, Yama (verses 92-94 ) states how water is to be offered to the deceased standing in navel-deep vater and (98) pre scribes that water is to be offered in water to gods and pitis but on the ground to those that died without upanayana being performed. In a smrti quoted by Devayājnika 513 it is stated that six pindas Tere to be offered from the day of death as follows: at the place where the death occurred, at the door of the house, where four roads meet, where the funeral procession on the way to the cemetery rested, on the pile of Food arranged for burning (cita), and at the time of the collection of the burnt bones. It was further provided that for the benefit of the departed a lamp fed by sesame oil was to be kept burning continuously for ten days after death and an earthenware Yessel was to be kept filled with water and a handful of cooked rice was to be offered on the ground at the time of the mid-day meal after uttering the name and gotra of the departed. This was called pātheya śrāddha because it helped the departed to go on his way from the earth to the world of the departed (Tide Dharmasindhu p 463). According to some of the digests

a śrāddha called Nagna-pracchadana was to be performed on the day of the death of a person after his sapindas undeṚgo sharing and bath, enter the village and the house. It consists in filling a jar with grains of rice wound round with a piece of oloth and putting clarified butter in a vessel of bell-metal and some gold (or coins) thereon according to one's ability. The whole was to be given to a poor brāhmada of good family after romembering Visou for the benefit of the departed Vide Smrtı muktāphala (on śr ) pp. 595-596, Sm C (on Aśauca p. 176 ),

The smrtis and purānas (like Kūrma, uttarārdha 23.70 ) prescribe that after offering with joined hands water to the deceased a ball of rice or barley flour with sesame was to be presented on darbha grass There are two views on this point, According to Ya. III, 16 a pinda vas to be offered for three days after death according to the procedure prescribed for Pinda-pitṛ-yajña (such as wearing of the sacred thread on the right shoulder and under the left shoulder ), while according to Vispu 19. 13 one pinda was to be offered every day as long as impurity on death lasted The pinda was to be offered on darbhas spread on the ground if the deceased had his upanayana performed, but without mantras or may be offered on a stone sly While water could be offered by any and every sapinda, pioda was to be offered only by the son (and when there were many sons, by the eldest if free from defect); in default of a son the nearest sapinda like a brother or brother's son was to offor it and in default of such then the sapindas of the mobbet (materna) uncle, his son or the like ) could 515 offer it. Even when pindas were to be offered for three days or āśauca lasted only for 3 days the pipdas were prescribed to be ten by Satatapa and Paraskara distributed them as follows three on the irsu day, four on the 2nā and 3 on the third and Dakga *** d1801)* buted them as follows. one on the first day, four on the 2nd and fiya on the 3rd Paraskara prescribed that 10, 12, 15, 30 pindas were to be offered according to the varṇa of the deceased i the case cited above from A I R. 1945 Patna p 211 at p 219 jt has been stated that according to the Benares school 4, 5 oro

II Views on pinas at cremation

pindas are offered at the time of cremation, while according to the Mithilā" school only. one pioda is offered. Everybody, whether a person of the same gotra as the deceased or of another gotra, had to carry out all the rites up to the tenth day wlien he once began them on the day of death, as stated by the Grhya-pariśista 517 and Garuḍapurāpa. It is further prescribed that when the funeral sites are begun by a person and then a nearer Telatiye such as a son comes, even then the former is to carry on all the rites up to the 10th day, but the rites of the 11th and later days are to be performed by the son and in default of him by a near sapinda. The Matsyapurāna states 518 that pindas should be offered to the deceased for twelve days; they become his food on his journey (to the other world) and they give bim satisfaction; since the deceased is taken to the abode of departed spirits after twelve days, he (his spirit) sees his house, sons and wife for twelve days Rsyaśroga quoted by Aparārka (p. 889 ) specifies the limbs of an ethereal body with which the deceased is endowed on each day of the ten days after death when a pinda is offered The Garuḍapurāpa (pretakhanda chap. 5. 33-36) says the same.

Just as sapindas of the same gotra and samānodakas were bound to offer water to the deceased, & person was bound to offer water to his maternal grandfather and to the two further ancestors and to his ācārya on their death. Every man, if he 80 desired (i. e, he was under no religious duty), could offer water to his friend, to his married sister or daugbter, to his sister's son, father-in-law and his sacrificial priest on their death (Pār. gr. III, 10, Saṅkha-Likhita, Yāj. 519 IL, 4) Paraskara (III. 10) refers to a peculiar practice. When the sapindas are about to enter water for bathing and thereafter offering water to the deceased they pray to their relatives or brother-in-law for water with the words 'we shall perform udakakriya , where-upon

the other roplios do so but don't come again (with a similar request),' if the deceased was less than one hundred years of age, but the reply would be simply do so if the deceased Tas hundred years of age or more.520 The G. P. S. (1, 4,4-6) has & somewhat similar symbolic dialogue. A king's officer, a sagotra or a brother-in-law takes a branch having thorns and provents them from entering water with the words 'don't enter'; then the sapindas should reply 'we shall not again enter Water'. The probable significance of this was that they thereby vould be able to escape from another death in the family soon after,

There were rules prohibiting certain persons from offering water to the deceased and also directing that water should not be offered to certain deceased persons. Impotent 521 persons and the like, thieves of gold, vrātyas, those who follow forbidden conduct and women that kill their own foetus or husband and that drink the kind of liquor (forbidden to them) should not offer water to a deceased person. Yaj (III. 6) provides that water should not be offered to and no āśauca observed for heretics, for those who do not belong to one of the four āśramas, to thieves, to women wao kill their husbands or who are guilty of prostitu tion or who drink surū, or who commit suicide. Manu (V. 89 90) is to the same effect, Gaut Dh, S. 522 14, 11 provides that in the case of those who start (through anger) on the Great

To whom no water is to be offered

Journey, who commit suicide by fasting or by means of a weapon or by fire, by poison, in water, by hanging or falling from a precipice or tree, there is no oremation, no asauca, Do offering of water or pinda. Haradatta on Gazt, 14. 11 quotes three verses froni Brahmapurāpa that those who die of a brāhmana's curse or black magic and those who are patitas are dealt with in the same way. But Angiras (9. by Mit, on Ya). II, 6) says that if one dies by water or fire or the like through inadvertence, there was āśauca for him and udakakriya tras performed. Vide Vaik, Sm S. V. 11 for a long list of persons who must not be cremated. In the Mahābhārata the rites of cremation have been described frequently eg. the cremation of Pandu in Adiparva, chap 127 ( the body was carried in a frika covered on all sides, there were musical instruments, the royal parasol and chowries were carried in the procession, distribution of vealth to mendicants, carrying the dead body to the bank of the Ganges on a charming sylvan spot, bathing the body, applying sandalwood paste to it), of Drona in Strīparya, chap 23.38-42 (three samans were sung, his pupils with Dropa's wife in front vent round the funeral pyre, going to the Ganges ); of Bhisma in anusāsana 169 10-19 (fragrant resins were used on the pyre, his body was covered with fine clothes and flowers, an umbrella and chowries were held over the body, Kaurava vomen fanned the body with fans, sāmans vere sung ); of Vasudeva in Mausalaparva 7. 19-25; of killed Warriers in general in Striparya, chap. 26. 28-43 and of Kunti, Dhrtarāstra and Gandhārl in ' Aśramayasikaparya, chap. 39. In the Rāmāyaṇa ( Ayodhyā, chap 76 verses 16-20 ), it is said that the funeral pyre for Daśaratha was made with sandalwood, aguru and fragrant resins, with Sarala, Padmaka and Devadāru (pine) wood and various fragrant substances were heaped thereon, then Daśaratha's body was placed on the pyre and that Kausalyā and other women followed the corpse in &:blikās and conveyances aocording to their status,

If an āhitāgni died away from home, the Sat. Br. (XI, 5.1.13-14) provides that, having brought his bones home they were to be spread on a black antelope skin and arranged in imitation of the human frame, were to be covered with wool and ghee and burnt with his srauta fires and sacrificial imple ments. Similar rules are laid down in Kāt. Śr, 25.8-9, Baud. P.S, HII 8, Gobhilasmrti 11,47, Vas. Dh, S. IV, 37,

(Vol.

If even the bones could not be found, then the sūtras follorya ing the Azt Br. (chap. 32.1) and similar ancient workg523 provide that on a skin of black antelope one should make the effigy of a human frame with palāśa stalks (leaves) 360 in 521 pumber, the effigy should be bound round with woollen thread, should be covered with yava flour mixed with water and anointed witl clarified butter and cromated with his fires and sacrificial implements. The Brahmapurana (q. by Suddhi prakas& p. 187) contains similar rules about burning an efigy and ordains three days' impurity thereafter. Acc. to a smrti (a by Aparārka p. 545), the palūśa leaves were to be 362. They were to be distributed according to Baud. PS and Gaut. P S. as follows: 40 represent the bead, 10 the neck, 20 the chest, 30 the abdomen (udaa), 50 each of the arms, 10 the fingers of the two hands, 70 each of the two legs, 10 the toes of the feet, 8 the male organ, 12 the testicles. This is also the enumeration in Sat śr. 29.4.39. Vide also Śān, Śr. IV 15,19-31,52 Kāt. ŚT. XXV. 8.15, Baud, P. S. II 8, G. P.S.

Jātākarnya (a by Aparārka p. 545 ) and Bhaviṣyapurāpa (q. by Suddhi. prakāśa p. 187 ) say that when a son does not hear for 15 years about his father who had gone to a distant land, he should perform the cremation of the effigy (called 'akrtidahana'). Bghaspati advises waiting for 12 years before resorting to akrtidalang (Suddhipr. p 187). The Vaikhānasa-sinārta-sutra V. 12 regards the burning of the effigy as a meritorious act for every one and does not restrict it to the case where the body or bones are not found. The Suddhiprakāśa p. 1897 quotes several Verses from the Brahmapurāpa that the procedure of burning an effigy of palāśa stalks was to be followed even in the case of one who has not consecrated Srauta fires and āśauca for three days has to be observed, while the aśauca for burning the effigy of an ābitagpi was ten days.

It is further provided in Sat śr. 29, 4. 41, Baud P.S. (II, 7. 4) and Garuḍapurāna II, 4. 169–70 that, if after the effigy is cremated in the belief that a person died in a foreign land, he returns alive, then he is plunged in a pit containing clarified butter and then he comes out of it, takes a bath, then all the sainskāras from jātalarına are performed on him, then be marrieg the same wife again or if she be dead, he may marry another girl, then consecrate again śrauta fires. Some sūtras provide that if the wife of an āhitāgni dies before him, he may, if he so desires, cremate her with his srauta fires or be may cremate her with fire prepared from covdung and some easily inflammable things (like straw) placed in three sthālis (cooking pots 526). Manu (V. 167-168) provides that if the savarṇa and virtuous wife of a twice-born person who had consecrated sacred srauta fires died before him she was to be cremated with big fires (srauta and smārta) and with the sacrificial implements. Then he may marry again and consecrate srauta or smārta fires again, To the same effect are Yā). T. 89, Baud.

and Yama allows the recital of the Yamasūktā (Ṛg. X. 14) and the versos in honour of the god Yama, Manu V 70, however, states other optional provisions viz, that the offering of water may be done (and therefore the cremation also of the dead body) in the case of infants that have struck teeth or after nāmakar ana. Thereforo there is an option as to cre mating an infant of less than two years, viz it may be buried or cremated after nāmakarana or after the appearance of teeth. In this case it is not necessary that all the sapında relatives should follow the dead body If a child is two years old or more at death and upanayana has not been per formed it must be cromated with ordinary fire and water must be offered silently. The same rule applies to a child whose cūčā (tonsure) had been performed before death as stated by Laugāksi. 528i The Vaik, Sm. S. V.11 lays down that there is no burping with fire until the 5th year for a boy and the 7th year for a girl After Upanayana the chuld was to be cremated according to the rites prescribed for an āhitāgoi 80 far as they could be applied (i, e, there would be cremation without sacrificial implements and the mantra 'asmat tvam abbijātosı' was not to be recited) The Baud 529 P. S. (II 3.10-11) provides that tliere is no cremation for children dying before the performauce of carla ( tonsure) and there is no pittimedha for those wlioge upanayana had not been perforined at death or for unmarried girls. It also provides that infants that have struck no teeth are to be buried with syllable 'om' and those that have had teeth with the Vyāhrtis The Mit. on Yaj. III 2 summarises the rules as follows: Before Nāmakarana there was to be only burial and no offering of water and the like; after Nāmakarapa up to the third year cremation and offering of water are optional with burial, from the third year up to upanayana there is cremation and also offering of water but silently (without mantras ), If Oūdā ceremony was performed before the 3rd year and the child died then also the same rule applied. After Upanayana the deceased vas to be cremated with ordinary fire but the procedure was to be the same as for an āhitāgni,

Disposal of an ascetic's corpse

A yati (sannyāsin) was and is even now buried. In a previous note (n, 528b) a verse of Kratu is quoted that a brahmacārin and yati are to be cremated with uttapana fire, The explanation of the Suddhiprakāśa (p. 166 ) is that the word yati here means an ascetic of the Kutīcaka kind and quotes a 530 verse as to how the dead bodies of the yatis of four grades are to be disposed of. The 531 Baud. P. S. IIL11 gives a brief description which is adopted with some variations by the . Smrtyarthasara (p. 98) that contains a description of the death rites of a parivrājaka. 532 One slould go to the east or north of the village, he should dig ā pit (lit, a sacrificial place) as deep as the staff ( carried by the yati) under a palāśa tree or on a river bank or on some other pure spot to the accompaniment of the vyjālirtis; then he should sprinkle water thereon thrice repeating the seven vpāhrtis each time, should spread darbha grass on the bottom of the pit, should deck the dead body (with garlands, sandal paste ), deposit the body in the pit with the mantra (Tai 8.1.1.3.1) 'O Viṣṇul guard this offering (the dead body ).' He should place in the right hand the staff of the parivrājaka (breaking it into three parts ) with the mantra ' Viṣṇu took strides over this' (Ṛg. I.22.17, Vaj. S. V.15, Tai. S. 1.2,13,1). He places the skija (loop of strings ) in the left

He then inpokes with the mantras beginning with 'cittih sruk' (ten sentences in Tai, Ā, Maitrāyani S 19 1 which are called 'oaturhotārah") 533 The other rites are not performed here as they were performed before No cremation should be done, no āśauca should be observed nor should water be offered to (an ascetic who is dead) who was free from all attachments and who had given bimself up to meditation, The Smrtyarthasāra adds that no ekoddista śrāddha nor sapindīkarana ss performed for an ascetic, but only par vana on the 11th day, that a kutīgaka should be cremated, the babūdaka should be buried, hansa should be thrown into water and paramahamsa should be thoroughly buried. The Nidayasindhu (pp 634-635) quotes the Smrtyartha sāra and then adds a few details from Brhat-Saunaka, riz that the dead body of a yatr should be bathed with the Purusasūkta (Ṛg X, 90), then the pit (dug for burial) should be sprinkled eight times with the syllable 'Om'on all sides; having deposited the body in the pit with the Yajus formula 'O Viṣṇu i guard this offering. (Tai S I 1. 3.1) and with 'Om', he should place in the right hand the staff with the mantra "Visou took strides over this' (Ṛg. I 22. 17), then pierce the crown of the head with & conch by repeating the mantra 'bhūr-bhuvah-svah', be should fill up the pit with salt to the recitation of the Purusasūkta (Ṛg. X. 90). He should fill up the pit thoroughly (with sand) in order to guard against jackals and dogs and the like (exhuming the body with their paws) The Dharmasindhu (p 497) adds some details particularly as to the number of hymns and mantras to be repeated It states that the crown of the head should be pierced with a conch or an axe. that one who is unable to do this gliould smash a ball of jaggery placed on the head. It adds that no yati except kuticaka should be cremated. In modern times a sannyāsin is always buried and not cremated, since kuticaka and babūdaka kinds of pati are no longer in vogue and it is only the paramahamsa that is prevalent in the whole of India.

Why ascetics were not cremated

appears to me to be as follows; part of the procedure of becoming an ascetic consisted in giving up his srauta fires and throwing in fire his sacrificial wooden implements (vide H. of Dh. vol. II. p. 954). One of the rules for ascetics is that he should not kindle siauta or smārta fires por kindle ordinary fire for cooking his food but was to subsist on cooked food obtained by begging (HI, of Dh. yol I pp. 933-934). The householder was cremated with his srauta or smārta fire but the ascetic, having abjured these, was without any fire and was therefore buried. The Vaikhanasasmārtasūtra X. 8 (ed. by Caland ) contains a brief description of the burial of an ascetic who was not an āhitāgni and the cremation of an ascetic who was āhitāgni,

Special rules were laid down about the cremation of women dying in or immediately after child-birth and women dying while still in their monthly illness. A smrti quoted by the Mit and the Smrti-candrikā (I p. 121) provides that in the case of a sūtehū, one should take water and pancagavya in a jar, should repeat holy texts (such as "apo hi sthā' Ṛg. X. 9. 1-9, verses addressed to varuṇa) over them, should then bathe the sūtikā with water and pañcagavya and then cremate the body. A woman in her monthly illness was to be similarly bathed and she was to be covered with another garment and then cremated. Vide Garuḍapurāna I 4. 171 ff and Nirnayasindhu p. 621. Similarly, elaborate rules are pres cribed about the rites of cremation in relation to the death of & pregnant woman (vide Baud P. S. II, 9, Nirnayasindhu p. 622) which are passed over here.

caves, 535 or being mummified (as in Egypt). The general rulo in India froin times of which we have literary evidence was cremation; though burial took place in certain cxceptional cases such as in the case of infonts, ascetics &o How tho ancient Indians hit upon this scientific though rather heart lending method of the disposal of dead bodios it is difficult to say 536. Burials were not unknown in India eren in rory carle times, as Atharvareda 5. 30 14 (mā nu bhumigrho bhurat) and 18 2 34 show. The last may be rendered as follows: O Agnil bring all those piits here in order that they may par take of the offering, those (pitṛs whose bodies) were buried or cast aside (exposed) or burnt or deposited above (on troos or in caves ? )s36. In the word 'anagnidagdhāh' occurring in Rs. X. 15. 14, scholars soe a reference to burial. But it is quito possible that no burial is referred to. If some ancestors worc killed far from home in a fight or if they wore kidnapped and killed by enemies, their bodies might havo beon Jeft uncared for in a distant land and not cremated nor buriod. A passage in the Chāndogya 537 Up. (VIII, 8. 5) is construed by some scholars as referring to burials. It may be rendored as followy. Therefore they designate evon now a man, an asura who dong not make gista, who has no faith and who offors no sacrifices; for this is the esoteric doctrino of Asiiras. They dock out the body of the dead with bhihsā (perfumes and forers ?), with s raiment by way of decoration, and think that they will thuis conquer the next world. Though the passage is not quito clear, the reference to Asuras, their usage of docorating the dead body and thereby being able to gain the nort world sonder it probable that the usage of the burial of the body among Asuras is roforred to. In Ṛg. VII 89.1 tho sago prays 'O varuṇa!

may I not go to the earthen house'. This is probably & re ference to buria). Besides, after the charred bones were collec ted, they were placed in an urn or pot, which was buried in the ground and after a good deal of time & mound (śmaśāna) was built upon the bones as will be seen immediately from a passage in the Sat Br, and other sources In A V. XVIII % 25 it is said, 'may the tree not oppress them, nor the great goddess Earth'. This is probably a reference to a coffin and burial.

It is somewhat curious that the progressive nations of the West, believing in a literal interpretation of the Biblical words (such as Matthew 22.23-33, Mark 12. 18-27 and Luke 20. 37-38, John 5. 19-31 and 6. 32-56) about physical resurrection of the dead, held fast by burial alone and up to the end of the 19th century people in Christendom would not allow the cremation of a dead body. The case of Reg. v. Price illustrates how deep the sentiment against cremation was and how popular fury prevented Price from disposing of the body of his dead child of five months by petroleum fire in a field, how he was prosecuted for two offences viz. misdemeanor at Common Law for burning a dead body instead of burying it and misdemeanor on the ground that he attempted to burn the body with intent to prevent an inquest being held on it by the coroner.538 It was only in 1902 that the Cremation Act (% Edw. 7 Ch. 8) was passed empowering burial authorities to establish crematoria on plans approved by the Minister of Health. The Catholic Church does not even now allow cremation. The ancient Romans on the other hand held crepation as the honourable means of the disposal of the dead body but reserved burial for the suicide and the murderer.

Embalming the dead for some time at least was not quite unknown in India. The Sat, Śr, 29. 4, 29 and Vaik. Śr, 31.23 539 prescribe that if an ābitāgni died away from his people his corpse should be laid down in a tub or trough filled with sesaine oil and brought home in a cart. In the Rāmāyaṇa it is several times said that the body of Dasaratha was placed for several

What the state of things was before the composition of tho Ṛgveda cannot be said with certainty. There is no general agreement as to the age of the Ṛgveda and of the ruins found at Mohenjo-daro and Harappa. Sir John Marshall (in Mohonjo daro vol. I. p. 86) refers to complete burials, partial burials and post cremation burials. The excavations at Lauriga sil Nandan garh have brought to light supposed Vedic burial mounds in which has been found a small repousse golden plaque bearing the figure of a nude female, the Earth Goddess These and the disposal of corpses in paleolithic ages are matters for archaoo logists and are outside the proper scope of the present work.

The Hāralata (p. 126 ) quotes a passage from the Adipurada to the effect that Magas (Magians) are buried undoṚground and that Daradas and Luptrakas (?) go away after placing their dead relatives on trees. S41a

It appears that among early Buddhists in India hardly any religious ceremony was performed, whether the person docoased was a layman or even a member of the Order. In tho Mahāparinibbāna Suttanta the death and the funeral cererronios of the great founder of Buddhism are described in chaptor V ( Section 14 ff). All that is gathered from that chapter is that the favourite disciple of the Buddha, Ananda, uttered a stanza, some of the disciples that were not free from passion wept and fell beadlong on the ground, while others (who wora Arobots) bore the grief with composure, that next morning Ananda went to the Mallas of Kusinārā, that the Mallas took perfumea,

garlands, all musical instruments and five hundred suits of apparel, the Mallas passed seven days in paying bomage to the body of the Buddha that lay in the sala grove with dancing, hymns, music, garlands and perfumes, in making canopies of their garments, that on the 7th day they carried the body of the Blessed One to the south but owing to a miracle (described in sections 29-32) they carried it through the city by the north gate and laid the body to the east (the general rule was that a dead body was not to be carried through the middle of a village, and was to be carried to the south but as Buddha was so extraordinary and holy the above was allowed to be done ). The body of the Buddha was then wrapped in a new cloth, then with cotton wool, then in a new cloth and so on till 500 layers of cloth and cotton wool covered the body The body was then placed in an oil vessel of iron which was covered with another oil vessel of iron, Then a funeral pile of all kinds of perfumes was built upon which the body was placed. Then Mahākassapa and five hundred brethren accompanying him arranged their robes on one ahoulder (representing the way in which the sacred thread is arranged among the brābmapas), bowed down with clasped hands, went round the body reverently thrice, The body was then burnt and only bones remained. Then the narrative states that Ajataśatru, king of Magadha, the Licohavis of Vesāli and several others claimed portions of the relics of the Buddba. Then the relics were divided into eight parts. Those who received them built mounds (Thūpas) over the relics and the Moriyas who got only embers also built a Thūpa over them and a brahmaṇa Dona (Drona) built a mound over the jar (kumbha) in which the bones were collected. Mr. Rhys Davids remarks (8. B. E vol. XI Introduction p. XLV) 'though funerals are naturally not infrequently mentioned in the historical books and in the Birth stories there is nowhere any reference to a recognised mode of performing any religious worship'. It will ba noticed that the Buddhist ritual 512, though simple, agrees closely with some of the rules of Aśv. gr.

As the departed spirit, being helpless, has to swallow the tears and phlegm cast by kinsmen, they should not weep but should perform (obsequial) rites according to their ability.' Gobhilasmrti III. 39 uṚges 'do not lament for what is perishable and what is the characteristic (destiny) of all beings. Exert yourselves in the performance of meritorious acts which will accompany you' Gobhila then quotes Yāj. TI, 8-10 and one verse from the Mahābhārata 544a viz. 'All collections are to end in dissipation, all rise is to end in fall, all unions in separa tion and life in death'. Aparārka quotes the Rāmāyaṇa and Vasudeva's words from the Salyaparya to Dhrtarāstra on the death of Duryodhana, The Par. M. 1.2 pp. 292–93, the Suddhi prakāśa pp. 205-206 and several other works quote the verges of Vispu, Yāj. and Gobhila.

The Garuḍapurāna here (II. 4. 91-100) waxes eloquent over the immolation of a wife on her husband's funeral pyre, over the miraculous power of a pativratā, and states that a brāhmana woman should not burn herself apart from her husband's body (or afte, he is cremated), but that ksatriya and other women may do so, that the practice of sati is common to all women even including chandāla women, but pregnant women or those that havo young children should not do so and that a woman does not beconie free from the liability to be born again and again as a woman until she becomes a Sati.

After listening to the philosophical discourse of elders the relatives return to their house, placing children in front and standing at the door of the house, they with minds under control bite the leaves of the nimba tree, perform Öcamana, touch fire, water, cowdung, white mustard; then they should enter their house after slowly , (firmly) planting their foot on a stone.

let them eat no mineral salt or ordinary $48 salt for three nights, let them optionally avoid for twelve nights the distribution of gifts and the study of vedic texts if one of the principal gurus (father, mother or the teacher who performed upanayana and taught the whole Veda) dies. Pār. gr. IIL 10 adds that they should remain chasto, eat food only once in the day and that they should not repeat Veda study, and should give up the daily obligatory duties except those connected with Vedic fires. Manu (V. 73) adds that they should not eat flesh for three days. Vas. (4.14-15 ) lays down that the relatives who returned from the cemetery should sit down for three days on mats and fast, that if they are unable ( to fast for three days ) they should subsist on food bought in the market or obtained unasked. Ya. III 17 and Pār. III, 10 549 provide that for the night they should put milk and water in an eartben Tessel in the open space (on a szkya) with the words 'O departed onel bathe here (in the water) and drink this milk'. Yāj III, 17, Paithinasi, Manu V. 84, Par. gr. III 10, and others state that the relatives of the departad should perform their own daily rites to be performed in the frauta fires (such as Agaibotra and Darsapūrpamāsa) and in the smārta fire (such as morning and evening homa) on account of the peremptory dictates of the Veda (such as one should perform Agnihotra as long as one lives'). The commentators have added several limitations and restri ctions. The Mit.553 on Yā). III, 17 states that, as Manu V, 84 only prohibits the stopping of the rites in (Vedic and Smarta ) fires, such religious duties as the five daily Mahayajñas are excluded, that Vaiśvadeya, though performed in fire, is excluded because there is an express text of Samyarta & brāhmapa should be without Vaiśvadova for ten days ( after the death of a sapinda ), that the Srauta and Smārta rites should be got per formed by another, as Pāraskara (III 10'anya etāni kuryuh) expressly lays down Only nziya and narmittaka acts to be parformad in Vedic and Smārta fires are allowed and so Icāmya rites cannot be performed.

perform their srauta nitya homa during days of impurity them selves, though some get it performed by another (Vide Yā). III, 17, Manu V 84). Although there is a text of Gobhilasmrti (III 60 ) prohibiting the performance of sandhya, yet relying on & sūtra of Paithinasi the Mit says that a man can offer water to the Sun in worship; others like the Sertimuktāphala (p. 478) say that sandhyā mantras may be revolved in the mind, except the prāpāyāpia mantras. This is followed in modern times in many parts of India. Viṣṇu Dh, S, 226 prescribas that in impurity due to birth or death homa (Vaiśvadeva ), giving and accepting gifts and the study of Voda ceasa, The Vaiks Sm, S. VL4 states that the perform enga of sandhyā adoration, all rites for the gods and manes, gift and acceptance and Veda study should be given up during impurity on death. Gautama 14,44 appears to hold that a brāhmana is not affected by impurity on birth and death for the purposes of Veda study. On the other hand Samvarta 551 (43) affirms that on the days of impurity on birth and death there is no performance of the five Mahāyajñas nor of Veda study. The Nityācāra-paddhati p 544 states that even in hbauca the thousand names of Viṣṇu may be recited.

Asthisanirayana or Saficayang means that rite in which the (charred) bones (of the cremated person) are collected. This rits is dealt with in many sūtra and smrti works, such as Sān. Sr. IV, 15. 12-18, Sat śr. 28. 3, Āśy.gr. IV, 5 1-18, Gaut P.S I. 5, Viṣṇu Dh, S. 19. 10-1%, Baud P.S I 14, Kausika-sūtra 8%. 29-3%, Vaik. Smārta Sūtra V. 7, Yama 87-88, Saṁvarta 38, Gobbila-smrti II. 54-59 (q. by Hāralatā p. 183). There is great diveṚgence of views about the day on which this was to be done. For example, Sat Sr. 28, 3. 1 provides : 552 'bones are collected on the next day after cremation) or on the 3rd, 5th or 7th.' Samyarta (verse 38) and Garuḍapurana (Pratakhanda 5 15 ) prescribe that collection of bones should be made on the 1st, 3rd, 7th or 9th and (particularly) on the 4th by twice-born persons The Vāmanapurana (14 97-98) allows it on the 1st, 4th or 7th day. Yama (87) requires the relatives to collect bones from tho 1st to the 4th day after cremation and also provides (verse 88)

that the four yarpas should respectively perform sañcayana on the 4th, 5th, 7th and 9th day. The Aśv. gp, $. IV. 5. 1 states that saflcayana should be performed after the 10th day from oremation in the dark half, but on uneven tithis (i. e. 1st, 3rd, 11th, 13th, 15th) and on a raksałra which bears a name not applicable to two or more naksatras (i. e. except on the two Aṣāḍhas, two Phalgunis and two Bhādrapadās). Vispu Dh. S. 19 10, Vaik. Sinārta-sūtra V. 7, Kaus. 82. 29, Viṣṇupurāne ILI, 13 14, Kūrmapurīna (uttara) 23 and a few other works lay down that saīcayand must be done on the 4th day after cromation. The various texts differ a good deal in details. The following is the procedure in the Āśv, gr. IV.5.-The bones of a male should be collected into an urn that has no spacial marks (protuberances), those of a woman in an urn that has protuberances but no other special marks, Åged persons," odd in number 553 not being together with women, (i. 8, not as a mixed assemblage ) collect the bones. The per former walks thrice round the spot (where the body was burnt) with his left side turned towards the spot, sprinkles on it with a sami branch milk mixed with water with a verse esitike' (Ṛg. X, 16, 14). With the thumb and the 4th finger they (gatherers ) should put each single bone into the urn without making a ratt}ing noise (of the bones in the urn), the bones of the feet being taken first, those of the head last. Having well gathered the bones and having purified them with a win llowing basket (i. e. Temoving the dust attaching to them) they should put the urn in a pit at a place where the waters from different sides do not flow together except rain water with the verse 'upasarpa' (Ṛg. X 18, 10) and he should throw earth (into the pit) with the following verse (Ṛg X. 18. 11) After having thrown (earth) he should repeat the next verse (Ṛg. X, 18, 12). Then covering (the mouth of the urn) with a lid with the mantra 'ut te stabhnāmi' (Ṛg, X, 18, 13) (he fills up the pit) Thon without looking back they return (towards the house), bathe in water and then offer sraddha to him alono (the departed).

pp. 223-307 rogards (p. 285) Ṛg. X, 18 as & hymn dealing with burial of tho whole body (and not of ashes), while he admits (p 287) that Ṛg. X. 16 is a cremation hymn. I dissent from him for various reasons; the niost important is that if his theory be correct a period of several conturios must be postulated between the two hymns, This is inadmissible.

The Kausikasutra (82, 29-32) prescribes certain details differently. It says that the bones are collected with A. V. 18. 2. 84, 26, then they are consigned to a jar over which alj frag rant powders aro scattorod, then the jar is raised with the Utthāpani yorses and carried with the verses called Haridis (ie, A V. 18 % 11-18). He (the performar) deposits (in the earth the urn) at the root of a troo with the verse 'mā tva' (A. V. 18. 2. 25 May the tree not injure thee all round, may not tho wido goddess Earth also injure theo'). 551

The other sūtras present several yariations which are passed over here, excopting one or two matters. The Sat, Sr, proridos that the twig should be of the Udumbara trae, that the bonos aro collected by women of the family of the decaased (his sifo and othora) odd in number (five or more), or other womon (in the absonce of women of the family). A woman who is not likoly to have a child should tie in her left hand a Brhati fruit with two threads, blue and red in colour, should step on a stone with hor left foot, colloct the bones first from the teethiyo or head with the mantra uttistbata' (Tai Ā VI. 4. 2) and she should deposit those bones in a jar or garment, then a second woman of the same type collects bones from the shoulders or arms, a third woman from the sides or hips, a fourth from the thighs or legs, and a fifth from the feet They or mora vomon collect the bones completely, The urn is deposited at the root of a sami or palāsa tree,

In modern times, particularly in towns and cities, the collection of bones has to be done immediately after cremation. The Antyesti-paddhati closely follows the procedure prescribed in the Aśv. gr quoted above. It eays. the perfornier goes to the place of cremation, sips water, meptions the time and place, makes a saṅkalpa (declaration) that he will perform the collec

tion of the bones of the departed naming him and his gotra, He walks thrice round the place of cremation with his left towards it and sweeps it with a sami branch and sprinkles it with milk mixed with water with the mantra 'śītike' (Ṛg X. 16. 14). Then old men odd in number with the performer collect the bones (as stated by Aśy.gr, above) and place them in a new jar and if they are of a woman in a jar with protu berances They also winnow the ashes with a sūrpa and place in the jar even small bones and throw the ashes into the Ganges. Then at some time other than the rainy season a pit should be dug in a pure spot whereon water would not flow and the performer deposits the jar in the pit with the mantra 'approach this mother, Earth' (Ṛg. X. 18, 10). With Ṛg X, 18. 11, he throws earth in the pit all round the jar and muimurs with folded hands the mantra (Ṛg X, 18, 12 ) and he closes the jar with a new earthen disk with the verse Ṛg. X. 18. 13 Then he should put earth on the jar in such a way that it may not be seen by anybody and without looking back should go else where and bathe, The Nirnayasindhu (p. 586 ) expressly states that the procedure for the collection of bones may be gathered from one's sūtra or from the work of Bhatta (i. o. Nārāyana, Kamalakara's grandfather).

The Vispudharmagūtra (19.11-12) and Anu, 26.32 state that the collected bones should be cast in Ganges water, since as many particles of the bones of a man remain in Ganges vater for so many thousands of years he dwells in heaven. It was provided in the Purāpas that a virtuous son, brother or daughter's son or a relative on the father's or mother's side should cast the bones in the Ganges, that one not so related should not do it and that if he does it he has to perform cāndrāyapa prāyaścitta. Even in modern times many Hindus take the charred bones of their parents or other dear relatives to the Ganges at Prayaga (Allahabad) or some other holy river 5540 or cast them into the sea. The Nirnayasindhu (p. 587 ) quotes an elaborate rite of casting the ashes in the Ganges from Saunaka. It is briefly as follows: The performer should go out of the village, bathe with clothes on, sprinkle the earth where the ashes are deposited with the Gayatri and the other mantras usually repeated over

Then he should bathe and purify the bonos by touching the bones again and again and repeating the mantras .eto nyindram stavāma suddham &c' (Ṛg VII. 95, 7-9). Then he should bathe with panca. gavya and become pura. Then he should batho ten times with cow's urino, cow's dung, cow's milk, curds, clarified butter, water in which kuśas have been dipped, ashes (of sacred fires), earth, honey and water. Then he should sprinkle (with kuśas) wator on the bones with the mantras, viz. Ṛg. 1,2% 16. Ṛg VIII 95,7-9, 555 Ṛg VII. 56.12-14, Ṛg. X. 126 1-8, Ṛg. X. 119,1-13, Ṛg.

Then he should cover the bones in seven ways viz. by doer-skin, woollen blanket, darbhurs, cow's hair, hempen cloth, birch leaf and palm leaf. He should cast among the bones pieces of gold and silver, pearls, coral and sapphire for the purification of the bones, then he should offer into fire 108 oblations of clarified butter and sesame with the hymn beginn ing with 'udiratām' (Ṛg. X. 15). Then he should cast the bones in holy water; thereby he does not incur the fault of touching an unclear object. While answering the calls of nature or performing acamana one should not hold the bodes,

The Nirnayasindhu adds (p. 588) that there is no asthi. sarcayana for one whose upanayana had not been performed.

The Aśv, gr. IV.6, the Sat Sr. 284, Sān Śr 46 (called parıdhikarma) and some others prescribe a sāntı rite after collection of the charred bones of a deceased person. The Baud. P. S. (II. 3 3) and Viṣṇu Dh. S. 19.19 appear to prescribe the Santi rite after the ten days of impurity have expired('dasarātre saucam krbyā sāntih'). It is described by Aśv. gr as follows: They who have lost a guru (father or mother) by death should perform on the new moon day an expiatory ceremony. Before sunrise they should carry fire together with its ashes and with its receptacle to the south with the half verse "I send away the flesh-devouring Agni' (Rtg X 16 9) Having cast that fre down at a place where four roads meet or somewhere else, they

At the time of the Agnihotra (in the afternoon, he should kindla fire (by means of the arabis) with, the half verse 'Here may this other Jatavedas' (Ṛg X. 16,9 latter half)'. Keeping the fire burn ing they sit till night silence falls, repeating tales of old mon (of the family) and stories of auspicious contents, Itzhāsas and Purūnas When all sounds have ceased or when the others (members of the deceased's family) have gone to their houses or Testing place, (the performer) should pour out a continuous stream of pater beginning at the south side of the door with the veṚge (Ṛg.

He should place tvigs round the fire with 'Here do I deposit an encircling thing'(Ṛg. X. 18.4). Having placed a stone to the north of the fire with the words "May they place a mountain between themselves and death' (Ṛg. X. 18.4 last pāda) and having sacrificed with four verses 'Go hence, O Death' (Ṛg. X. 18.1*), he should look at his people with the verse 'as days follow each other' (Ṛg. X 18.5).

sway the blades turning their faces away. The performer should Jook at them while they are salving their eyes, with the verse 'theso women, being to widows and having good husbands' (Ṛg. X, 18,7). The former should first touch the stone with the stream containing stones flows' ( Ṛg. X 538). After that, stationing himself to the north-east, while others go round with the firo, bull-dung and a continuous stream of water he should, aftor repeating the three verses (āpo hi sthā, Ṛg X, 9.1-3), murmur the Terbe "these have led round the cows' (Ṛg.

A cow, a cup of metal and a fresh unworn garment are the sacrificial fee for each of the brāhmanas.

A few details may be added from other sūtras. The Sat Śr, (28.4.1) provides that the Sānti is performed on the 10th day after cremation by a priest, that in the folded hands of the wives ( of the members of the family ) he puts the remains of the material used for oblations syith the veṚge * these women, not being widows' (Ṛg, X. 18,7=Tai.

the grave 560 or monument should not be built too soon after desth, lest he (the performer) freshen up the sin of the deceased ; that he should make it a long time after and when paople do not even remember the years (that have elapsed since the decease). He should make it in uneven years and under a single naksatra (i. e. containing a single stat such as Citra and Pusya, and not dnal such as Punarvasu and Visakhā or plural such as Kettikā ) and on the New Moon day. Let bim make it in autumn or in Māgha or in summer. The sepulchral mound should be four cornered, because the people who are worshippers of gods (or godly) make their burial mounds four-cornered, while those who are followers of Asuras, the Easterns and such like people, make them round. As to the choosing of the ground, the Sat. Br. states several views viz. he makes it on ground sloping towards the north or, according to some, to the south; but the Sat, Br, disspproves of both the views and prescribes that he should make the burial mound on any level ground where the waters flowing from a southernly direction come to the east and stand still without dashing forward and on such a ground one may make it (burial mound). Lot him make it on a pleasant and peaceful spot, but not on a road nor in an open space lest he should make the deceased's sin manifest. It should have the sun shining on it (at mid-day).

Ho pakos it on salt (barren) soil, on such ground as abounds in roots. Let him not make it near where grows the Bhūmipāśā plant or where reeds grow, or Aśvagandhā or Adhyanda, or Prśniparnī grows. He should not make it near an asrattha tres or near a vibhitaka tree or a tilvaka, a sphūrjaka or a haridru or nyagrodha tree or other trees that have an eril name (like slesmātaka or koyidāra) For one ho has per formed Agnicayana, he makes a tonb after the manner of the fire altar. One must not make it too large lest he should make the sin (of the deceased) large He should make it just a man's size, broader behind (to the west) and broader on the north side He encloses it with cords twisted in the non-sunwise way. He then bids them to out out the earth which would be just sufficient for making the mound of a man's size.

The Kāt Śr. (21. 3. 1 and 6) closely follows the above direc tions containod in the Sat 561 Br The Sat. ŚT. 29,1,prorides that when the day of cromation is not known or remembered one may croct a mound over the bones ( with clods of earth or bricks) on the New Moon day that comes immediately after the Full Moon day of Māgha, Phālguna, Caitra, Vaisakha or of the summer months (Jyestha and Asādha)

The Sat. Br. (XII. 8 2-4) pursues the subject of sepulchral monuments as follows: Godly people make their sepulchres so as not to be separate from the earth; while those trho are of the Asura stamp, the Easterns and others, make the sepulchral mounds so as to be soparate from the earth, either on a stone basin or a similar thing He then oncloses it with an undefined number of stones silently. He then sweeps the Bepul chral site with a palāśa branch with (Vāy S. 35.1 'May the niggardly god-haters go away') and prays that Yama may grant him ( the deceased) an abode He throws out the branch to the south side He then yokes the team of six oxen to the plough on the south side or on the north side, as he chooses Having given the order 'Yoka' he (the performer ) utters the

He then ploughs across the body (of the sepulchral site) silently with an undefined number of furrows He then unfastens the team of oxen To the right side (south-west) be removes this (the plough and the team ).

He then sows seeds of all kinds of herbs with a single verse (Vā).

He does so before sunrise so that the sun should rise over him while he is doing it He does so with Vāj S. 35. 5-6. He then says to some one 'Proceed in that ( southern ) direction without drawing breath and having thrown down the jar, return hither without looking behind.' He then mutters Vāj $. 35.7. He then arranges the dead man ( the bones ) limb by limb with Vāj. S. 35.8–9. Now thirteen unmarked 563 bricks each measuring a (human) foot (pada) have been made and are laid down

563 The bricks of the fire altar are taarled with lines (vide H of Dh. Vol II. p 1248) The bricks to Agnicayada are as long as the foot of the sacrificer. Thereon gods have to be worshipped Here it is the fathers to be bonoured Throughout Sat, Br. XIII 8 2-3 a distinction is drawn between wbat is done for the gods and what is to be done for pitṛs in order to keep the divine distinct from what belongs to the fathers In Agnicayana a bird-like pattern is the most frequent (vide H of Db vol II p. 1249) It is hence that the Sat Br. speaks of wings and tails. The heights prescribed for men of the several varṇas and for tomen are symbolic Ksatriyas, brābwanas aad vaisyas represent the arms, the month and thighs of the Parasa (as stated in Ṛg. X. 90.12).

home. They proceed towards the village muttering Vaj. S. 35.14 (ud vayam). When they have arrived, ointments for their eyes and feet are given to them; such indeed are buman means of embellishment and therewith they keep off death from them selses Then in the house having kindled (domestic) fire and laid enclosing sticks of zarana wood round it he offers by means of a sruva ( spoon) an oblation to Agni Ayuṣmat. Vaj. S. 35. 16 serves 367 as a puronur ākyā (invitatory formula). He then offers with Vāj. S. 35.17. He says this so that Agni may guard and protect these men. The sacrificial fee is an old ox, old barley, old chair with a head cushion, He may give more if he desires. This is the procedure in the case of one who has performed Agnicayana 568 In the case of him who has not performed Agni. cayapa, there is the same procedure for selecting a site and the same performance says that of the firs-altar Having fetched a clod from the boundary he deposits it midway between the sepulchral mound and the village with Vaj. S. 35. 15 (imam 569 Jivebhyah). He then makes this a boundary between the Fathers and the living, so as not to commingle the two.

The Sat. Śr. 29. 13 f, and Baud. P.S. I 17–20 provide a lengthy procedure for erecting a mound over the bones of one who has performed the special rite of agnicajana which is passed over here. In building a mound the urn deposited under - a tree is taken out and after the bones are purified in various Ways (such as the spilling on them of curds mixed with vājina from & jar, the digging up of the clods by means of a plough to which & certain number of oxen are yoked). The Sat. Sr. (29. 1. 3-12) deals with one kind of procedure in which there is no dhavana, while 29.1. 13-32 deal with the procedure where dhamana is employed and sūtras from 33 deal with procedure common to both pahsas (viz, one without dharana and the other with dhawna) The building of a mound with clods (lostaciti) in which there is dhavana is rather an obscure matter in its nature and had some symbolic significance which is now lost. It may be briefly described as follows. The members of the deceased's house

They drive in the eastern half or middle or wostern half of it a three-pronged palāsa peg, In front of it one born of a sūdra woman or a brahmabandhu ( a brāhmana only in name) sits down for a dialogue He asks the principal wife of the deceased) 'will you dwell with me.' That woman roplies to him 'I shall not give (what you ask).' The samo dialogue takes place on the 2nd day. Then on the third day she replies 'I shall give for one night' Or if this peculiar practice (of talking about dhavana, which literally means 'soxual intercourse') was intended to last for more days than three sho was to give a suitable reply (viz. for three nights or for five nights &o).

Various measurements are given in the sutras for the mounds that are constructed over the bones, Sat, Śr. (29.1 5-6) says 572 that the site of the mound / $maśūnāyatana ) is five prahramas on all four sides (or six on the east and five in the other directions, acc. to some ). The height of the mound is variously given ayen in the same sūtra. 573 Sat Śr. states that the height way be two finger-breadths, or three or four or a pradeśa (the distance between the thunib and index finger when both are stretched away) or a vlast, (twelve finger-breadtha), or it may be up to the knee or thighs or buttocks The Baud P S,T, 18 gives different 574 measurements. It states if the mound to be raisad is as high as the neck towards the west, then it is up to the pavel on the east, if it is as high as the naye) on the west, then it is as high as the knee on the east; if up to the knee on the west them on the east it is level with the ankle'.

255. Stages in the disposal of dead bodies

modern times. In the Baud. 578 P. S. I 17 there are passages that bear & close resemblance to sonze passages of the Sat. Sr on dhavana. Similarly, Kāt Sr. 579 21. 3,6 provides (immedi ately after the months in which mounds were to be constructed) that as many jars should be taken as there are persons perfoıın ing dhavana (or dhurana) and the conimentator explains that word as meaning 'fanning'.

It will be seen that the disposal of the dead in ancient India was divided into four stages viz. cremation, collecting the charred bones and depositing them underground in an urn, expiatory rites (called Santıkarma) and erection of a monument over the bones. The last was not necessarily done in every case. The Andhau Juscription of the time of Rudradaman in the year 52 (probably of the saka era ) refers to the erection of a staff (lasti i e, yasti) as a funeral monument to the inemory of a sister, brother and vife by Madana son of Sibila (vide E I VOI, 16 pp. 23-25). In a long passage of the Brahma purāna quoted by Aparārka (pp. 887-886) it is stated that the charred bones of a cremated person should be collected in an urn and deposited at the root of a tree or cast in the Ganges, that the place of cremation should be purified with cowdung and kator, that a puskaraka tree should be planted there or an eduka (a structure ) should be built over it. 580

The Sat Śr 28.4 28 and Baud P S. II. 3. 2 state as shown above thet the rites immediately after death were performed only up to the depositing of the urn (containing the bones) underground in the case of those housobolders who had not set up tbe vedio fires and in the case of married women and that in the case of him who had performed the solemn rite of Agni cayang & mpound with bricks or clods was built up on the bones.

[Vol.

It is remarkable that while slaves and even attendants Fere often buried with the aiaster in Babylon and Celtic Britain, there is no similar reference to the burial or cremation of anybody with the deceased even in the ancient procedure found in the Sat Br It is only possible to say that in some cases in the pre-Vedic age the wife might have burnt herself along with the deceased husband on the funeral pyre. There is no doubt that later works like the Viṣṇuidharmasutra recommended to women the practice of Satī as an option to leading the life of perfect celibacy after the husband's death,

The persons entitled to perform the funeral rites after death (antyakarmadhikarin) are the same as those entitled to offer sraddha. There is a good dea] of difference as to the order of the persons so entitled For example, Gautama (Dh. S 15 13-14) statos 'On failure of sons the sapındas (e g. brother, brother's 5012 ), the sapindas of the mother (eg maternal uncle or his con) and pupils may perform srāddha for the deceased; id default of these the family priest and the ācārya (veda teacher).' Saṅkha says 582 "The offering of pinda and water should be done by the son for the father; in default (i e absence or death) of the son, the wife of the deceased) should offer, but in default of her the full brotber' The Viṣṇupurāna 532 provides

the son, grand-son, great grandson (of the deceased), the offspring of the brother (of the deceased), the offspring of a sapinda become entitled to offer (pioda)' The Mārkandeya purāda provides (30. 19-21, chap 27.19-23 of the Veuk, ed.) 'On failure of the sons, sapindas, on failure of them the samānoda kas, then the sapindas of the mother, and samāpodakas of her, should perform these rites, a daughter's son should perform them (If the man dies sonless), the putrikāputra should perform them for bis maternal grand-Father: in default of all these, womeil should perform these rites for their husbands but without Vedic mantras; in default of wife the king should get the rites per formed by some one belonging to the fainily (of the deceased)

Adhikarin for Antyesti"

257

OT by persons of his caste, since the king is the relative of all yarnas 583 There was a close connection between taking the estate of a man and performing the rites after death up to the 10th day. For the doctrines represented by the Mitaksarā and the Dāyabhāga, vide H. of Dh. yol II pp. 734-743. Even those that regarded that inheri tance was based on relationship by blood and not on the capacity to offer pindas held that it was obligatory on everyone who took the estate of another (including the king who took as the ultimate heir by escheat) to arrange for the rites after death and śrāddha. Vispu 584 Dh. S. XV. 40 declares 'Whoever inherits the estate of a deceased person has to offer pinda to him.' Yāj. II 127 says the same thing about the Kse raja son (ubhayorapyasau rikthi pinda-dātā ca dharmataḥ).

· The Smrtyarthasāra (p. 94 ) states the order of adhikarins as fullors; a competent son is the first adhikāri for offering pinda; in default of a son, husband, wife and co-vives; in default of these, the brother's son, the brother, daughter-in-law, daughter, daughter's son, any other sagotra, & sapinda, a fellow-student, a friend, a pupil, the teacher, any relative and anyone who takes the wealth of the deceased may offer pında, The father is not competent to perform śrāddha rites for his (deceased) son, an elder brother for his younger brother; these may even do so through affection but they cannot perform the sapindīkarana, Parents may offer pinda to unmarried daugh ters, and even to married daughters in the absence of another (proper) giver. The daughter's son and the maternal grand father may offer to each other; the daughter's son to waterna) grand-mother; the son-in-law and father-in-law to each other, the daughter-in-law to her mother-in-law, brothers among them selves, teacher and pupil to each other.

[Vol. vol. II p. 739. The Nirnayasindhu 585 says that in the Kali age only two kinds of sons viz. aurasa and dattaha are allowed (out of the twelve mentioned by Yā]. IL 128-132) and the order of śrāddbadhikārins is given by it as follows: aurasa son, then grandson, then great grandson, then adopted son If there are many sons then the eldest alone is the adhikarin; if the eldest be pot present or is patrta, then the son next to the eldest is the adbikarin (and not the youngest). If the sons are divided from each other, then all the rites up to sapindikarana are to bo performed by the eldest alone who may make the other sons contribute to the expenses, but the yearly śrāddha may ba per formed by each son separately. If the sons (of the deceased) are not divided, then all rites including the yearly śrāddha also are to be performed by the eldest alone When the eldest son not being present, the younger one or the youngest per forms the cremation, he should perform all rites up to and inclu ding the sixteen śrāddhas, but not sapiodikarada and he should wait for one year for the arrival of the eldest If the eldest comes to know of the death within one year, he alone should perform the sapindīkarada, If the eldest son does not come even at the end of one year, then even the youngest may per form sapindīkarana. If before the expiry of one year the youngest son or some one other than & son performs the moothly, anumāsika, sapindikarana śrāddhas, then the eldest son or a son should again perform these. If there is a grandson who has his upadayana performed and there be a son those upanayana is not performed it is the latter who is a preferable adhikarin, provided he is either three years old or has the cūdā ceremony performed as stated by Sumantu 586 Manu IL 172 states that a boy should not repeat the Veda before the performance of Upanayana except the mantras that are te quired for the śrāddha of his deceased father or mother. Such a son may perform with Vedic mantras the funeral rites OD the death of his father or mother and their yearly and other śraddhas. If he is unable to repeat the Vedic mantras, be may simply perform the cremation Tith mantras and the rest may be got performed through another person. In the

'sama way he should make only the declaration (saṅkalpa) of darsaśrāddha and mahālaya and the rest may be performed by sonis one else. An adopted son becomes an adhıkārin for fune Tal rites and the like only if the upanayana has been performed. If there be no lineal descendant up to a great-grandson and also no adopted son, then the wife should perform with mantras the funeral rites and yearly and other śrāddbas but if she is unable to repeat the Vedic mantras, then the same rules apply as in the case of an anupanīta son. Even if the husband be not divided from his brother, or be be re-united with his brother, it is the wife and not the brother who is to be preferred as having adhikara for śrāddha, though the brother gets all the property. Though some of the latest works on dharmaśāstra like the Nirnayasindhu 587 and Dharmasındhu (bhāryayapi samantrakam-eya-aurdhradehikadikam kāryam) allowed the wife to perform rites after death with vedic mantras, several works such as the Mārkandeya-purāna and the Brahmapurada did not allow the wife to repeat Vedic mantras (vide note 583 above). In default of the wife, the daughter has the right to perform rites after death if the deceased was separated and not re-united. But if the deceased was joint then his full brother would be the proper adhikarin after the wife. Among daughters the married one is preferred, though an unmarrjed daughter is a preferable heir. In default of daughters, the daughter's son is an adhikarin; then a brother, then a brcther's son. Among brothers a full brother is preferred to a half brother and if there be both elder and younger brothers, then the younger is preferred for performing rites after death (in order to make as near an approach as possible to the relation of father and son). If there be no younger brother, then even an elder one could be adhikārin; in default of full brother, a half brother. Some held that even if the deceased was separata from his brother and had a daughter or daughter's son as heir the funeral rites were to be performed by the brother (and not by the daughter or her son), since & sagotra is to be preferred as an adhikarin to one of a different gotra. If there be no brother, then a full brother's son was to be preferred, then the half brother's son, then father, then mother, then daughter-in-law, then sister. In case of there being

full sisters, half sisters, younger and older sisters the same rules apply as in the case of brothers; in default of any sister, sister's SON. If there be many sister's sons, the rules as to brothers would apply. Then come paternal uncle, his son, other sapindas; 588 then samānodakas, then other persons born in the same family. In default of these, the sapipdas of the mother, such as the maternal grand-father, maternal uncle, maternal uncle's son is that order; in default of the sapindag of the mother, the sons of the deceased's paternal or maternal aunt; in default of these the prir-bandhus such as the sons of the father's father's sister, of the father's mother's sister, of father's maternal uncle; then the maātr-bandhus such as mother's father's sisters's son; in default of these, a disciple (of the deceased); in default of disciple, son-in-law of the deceased (or the father in-law of the deceased); in default of these, a friend; in default, any one who takes the wealth of a brābmana (deceased); if the deceased was other than a brābmana the king (who took the wealth of everyone dying heirless, except the wealth of a brahmaṇa) who arranges for funeral rites through another.

In the case of women the following order of those entitled to perform rites of a deceased woman is given in the Dharma sindhu (p. 370); If the female be unmarried then her father is the adhikarin, then her brother and the like; if the woman was married, her son, then her co-wife's son, then co-wife's grandson and then great-grandson; in default of these, the husband; in default of husband, daughter, then daughter's son; then busband's brother; then husband's brother's son; then daughter-in-last; then (the deceased) woman's father, then her brother; then her brother's son and the rest.

An adopted son should perform the śrāddha of his natural father if the latter left zo son or other adbikārl If a brahms cārin dies, his monthly, yearly and other sraddhas should be performed by his father and mother. A brahmacārın may carry the dead body of his parents, or of his maternal grand-father, upādhyāya and ācārya and perform the cromation and other rites; but if another adhikārin is available, he should not do these even for the parents and the other threo.

should zot at all carry the dead body of any one except of the above five or perform the cremation and other rites for any one 8]se. If a brahmacārin performed all the rites for ten days he had to observe āśauca for ten days, but if he performed only the cremation he had to observe āśauca only for one day. Even while in mourning his obligatory acts do not stop; but he should not eat the food cooked for bis relatives that are in mourning nor should be dwell among them; if he did (both these ) he had to undergo prāyaścitta and perform upanayana again,

It is somewhat curious that Baudhāyana, the Lingapurada (quoted in Srāddhaprakāśa pp. 361-371), the Markandeya. purāna, the pitṛdayitā (p 82) and several other works allow man himself while living to perform his own rites after death (antyesti).589 This will be dealt with briefly later on under śrāddha Further, if a man became patrta and refused to undergo prāyaścitta, he was driven out of the Hindu fold by the pro cedure of ghatasphota (vide H. of Dh. Vol. II pp. 387-388), and Gaut. Dh, S. 20 % and Manu XI. 182-183 provide that such a man was to be held to be dead and his relatives were to perform a]l rites for him such as offering water and srāddha and were also to obserye āśauca for him.590

Many commentators and digests quote certain verses of the Vispupurāpa (III, 13. 34-39) wherein the rites (kriyah) after death performed for a person are enumerated as falling into three classes, viz. pūrva, madhyama and uttara. The rites from cremation up to the end of the 12th day are called pūrya, the śrāddhas performed monthly and sapindikarana and ekoddista are called madhyama rites and those that are performed after sapindīkarada, when the deceased has reached the position of pity after being a preta, are designated uttara,591 The pūrva and

[Vol. madhyama rites of the deceased may be performed by the father, the mother, sapindas, samānodakas and those belonging to the deceased's group (gotra) or by the king if le takes the wealth of the deceased. But the rites called uttara are to be performed only by the son, grandson, great-grandson, daughter's son or the latter's sons Even in the case of women, on the day of the anniversary of death every year an ekoddista srāddha may be performed for them. There is also another classification of śrāddhas viz. Navaśrāddha (those rites up to ten days after death), Navamiśra (those performed after ten days up to six seasons), Purana (those perfornied after a year ).591a

As stated above, for ten days after death a bandful of water mixed with sesame was to be offered to the deceased on a stone (aśman) placed on kuśa grass and one large pinda (called pūraka-pipda) was to be offered on busa grags everyday with the face to the south and the sacred thread on the right shoulder (prācidāpiti) for the purpose of freeing tho departed from the state of being a preta. On the pinda, yator mixed with sesame was to be offered and leaves of Bhragarāja (called mākā in Marathi) and Tulasi also. The verse 'anādi. nidhano' was to be repeated 592. The performer throws the pinda in water and then bathes. Vide A.K. D pp. 43-50 and Antyesti-paddhati of Nārāyana for detailed treatment of the procedure of these ten days. Besides this, the Asvalayana grhyaparisistass IIL 6 speaks of five sraddhas called 'nava

According to the Garuḍapurada (Pretakhanda 34, 36 which speaks of six śrāddhas on uneven days from 1st day to 11th) and Apastamba they are six (Dharmasindhu p 464, Nirdayasindhu p 588, Suddhiprakāśa pp. 214-216, Srāddhatattva p. 619) and accord ing to others there is an option. Angiras and Vasistha speak of six Navasrāddhas on uneven days from the 1st to the 11th, while Baud pitṛmedha S. IL 10, 6 speaks of five. Some prescribe the placing of some cooked food sprinkled with ghee on the hand of a brāhmana. Others do not approve of this They prescribe the placing of uncooked corn in front of a brāk mapa or in front of a figure of a brābmaṇa made with kuśas (called cata in Marathi). The Garuḍapurāpa (IL. 5, 67 ff) holds that the payasrāddhas are those performed at the place where

man died, where the funeral procession rested on the way, when the bones were collected and those performed on the 5th, 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th and 11th day, The Suddhiprakās3 p. 214 quotes similar views from Katyāyana and the view of Viddha-Vasistha that the deceased does not become free from the status of a preta, unless the navafrāddhas are performed. The Garuḍapurāna, Pretakhanda (chap. 34. 27-28, 44, 48) states that by the pindas offered for ten days the several limbs of a subtlo body are provided for the departed spirit which at first wanders like thin air. There are several differing views on tho napaśrāddbas which are passed over here. On the uneven days if navaśrāddha is performed two pindas will be offered (one the daily one and the other, of the Dayaśrāddha). The Padma (Srstikhanda 10. 19) prescribes that one should not pat take of the food at navasraddha and on doing so should undergo the cāndrāyada expiation.

In modern times, after the rites of the first day of crema tion and of the collection of the bones, the rites for the dead generally begin on the 10th day. The performer goes to the place where the rites of the first day were performed, makes a saṅkalpa and offers a pinda with the words "May this pinda wait upon the preta Damed N. N, and of the gotra (Kāśyapa &o ) in order that hunger and thirst affecting the preta may be removed'. Theo he offers water mixed with sesame, places leares of blrngarāja and tulasī, repeats the verge 'anādini dbano' (nota 592), removes the pinda to another place from the place where it was offered. Then he prepares & Led: with

Then he offers a request to the middle jar with the words 'May this pinda together with the jar of water wait upon the preta by name N, N, of such and such a gotra in order that his hunger and thirst may be allayed'. There is a prayer before the jars to the east, south, west and north respectively to those whom the preta had befriended, to Yama, to crows, to Rudra raspectively. There is a difference of view here, some pres. cribing four jars, soma three, while others offer a pipda with the jar of water only on the place meant for the preta and mera pinda to others Then water is offered over the pinda and to each of the above he offers sandals, umbrella, banner, bread. Then the performer waits till a crow seizes or eats the pipda placed to the west 594, Then the aśman (stone) is anointed with oil and cast in water. Then the performer requests the relatives, who offer one handfu) or three handfuls of water to the preta on the bank of the reservoir of water. Then the sons and others accor ding to usage cut their hair and nails. Then all persons of the same gotra, according to the custom of the country, bathe with sesame and myrobalan, wear pure and dried garments, go home and take their meals there.

594 In modern times great importance is attached by many people to a cron todching and pecking at the puda food There is a common belief that if a crow does not touch the pioda then the deceased bad some intense wish at his death that was unfulfilled and it is certainly beart-read ing and a source of poignant sorrow even for passers-by to see the relatives waitiog for hours and tempting the crow or crows to come dove from trees with dainty pieces of copra and other things and also loudly declaring that they would do this or that and fall the last desire of the deceased Often it 50 happeos that no crow touches the pinda food in honour of the deceased, a very old and venerable man, and relatives are very much distressed to fiod that their venerable ancestor who could have hardly any ambition or desire at the advanced age of 50 or 30 (except to die speedily), judging from the reluctance of the crow, had some udfolflied desire, Often the crow immediately touches the piada offered to one who died very young (say 25 or 30 years old) and wbo would naturally be presened to have many unfulfilled desires In such cases the relatives feel very much relieved at the thought that their young relative passed away without any uplalalled desires The Saddbakaumudi refers to this offering to crows as a usage सथाचारात् काकालिदानम् । पिण्डशेपमनं पात्र छन्ना अमुफगोत्रस्य प्रेतस्यामनशमणों विशेपत्तये पमहारापस्थितवायसाय एप बलिन म इत्युत्तुज्य कृतासलि-काक व यमहतोसि रहाण पलिमुत्तमम् । यमलोकगतं प्रेत बमाप्पायितुमर्हसि ॥ कामाय कासपुरुपाय वायसाय महात्मने । तुम्य भलिं प्रयच्छामि प्रेतस्य दृषिहेतवे ।। इति पठेत् । शुद्धिकौमुदी p. 135.

IV

Ethereal body after death

265

Some of the Puranas and medieval digests assert that after a man dies, the soul or spirit assumes that is called an ativahika sin body consisting of three of the five elements (vir. fire, vind and akāśa) that rise up from the dead body (while two viz, earth and water remain below), that such a body is obtained only by men and not by other beings, that with the aid of the pindas that are offered to the departed at the time of cremation and during ten days thereafter, the soul secures another body called bhogadeha (a body for enjoying the pindas offered) and that at the end of a year when sapındıkarana is performed, the soul securos a third body wherewith the spirit reaches heaven or bell according to the nature of his actions, The word 'ativāhika' is comparatively an ancient one. It occurs in Vedantasutra IV. 3.4 (ativahikas-tal-lingat). But there the meaning is somewhat different. The Upanisads speak of the soul as going by the path of arcas, day &c. The sutra says that these (viz. ar cis, ahah &c.) are superintending deities that take the soul gradually opward by the path that leads to Brahma. Govindānanda in his commentary on the Prāgaścitta viveka (pp. 13-14) holds that there are only two bodies (and not three as appears at first sight), viz, the ātrvāhika or pretadeha and the blogadeha. The belief was that the man on whose death Do pioda was offered or the sixteen śrāddhas (to be described below) vere not performed remained for all time in the condi

(VOL. tion of a pisaca, from which he would not be freed upon if numerous other śrāddhas were later on offered for him, 595 The Brahmapurāna calls the body 'yātaniya'(i.e, one that has to undergo trials and torments), while the Agnipurāpa calls it

yātāniya' or 'ativāhika' and asserts that this body is made up of the elements of ākāśa, vāyu and tegas The Padmapurāna (IL 67, 98 ) states that persons who commit certain sins secure after death a body similar in shape to the physical body for undergoing torments. The underlying conception was that when the gross body was destroyed after death by cremation, burial or other methods an intermediate subtile body had to be built up before the departed soul was compelled to assume another body in a fresh incarnation The subtile body was gradu ally built up, as stated by the Mārk 10.73, by the rites performed on death and on several days after death. Though this con ception is very clearly set forth in the Purāṇas it should not be supposed that it was altogether a new one. It had its roots deep down in the earliest Vedic period and was implioit in some of the hymns as indicated by Rg. X, 15. 14, X. 16, 4-5 translated above. Though in the Tai. S. I 8.5 1-2 and in passages of the Tai, Br, and Sat. Br to be set out later on it is said that the offerings are made to the paternal ancestors, it does not follow that the brāhmanas were not fed at the same time on the food prepared for being offered to the ancestors, just as in the solemn Vedic sacrifices offerings were made to the gods, Agni, Indra, Prajāpati, Visou and others and at the same time priests engaged in the sacrifices were fed and given presents ( dalsına). Therefore, it need not be necessarily sup posed that feeding the brahmaṇas at sraddha vas & later idea and offering food to the dead was the origina] idea.
