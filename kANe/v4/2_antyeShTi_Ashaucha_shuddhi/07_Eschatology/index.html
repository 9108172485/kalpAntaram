  <p>CHAPTER VII</p>
<p>ESCHATOLOGY</p>
<p>What happens after death to a human being (which is the subject matter of Eschatology) has been a great mystery that has intrigued and baffled mankind in all ages and was a question of vital importance among almost all ancient peoples such as the Indians, Egyptians, Chaldeans, Greeks and Persians. The Ford Eschatology is derived from a Greek term meaning &lsquo;last things and is applied to the study of opinions that men have held from time to time concerning the future, including such matters as the state of man after life on this earth and the end of the world. It exercises a great fascination over most people and speculation on it can be carried on endlessly. Every religion has its own eschatology. There are two aspects of Escha tology; one is concerned with the destiny of the individual after death, immortality of the soul, sin and punishment, the meaning and content of &lsquo;Heaven&rsquo; and &lsquo;Hell&rsquo;; the other aspect of eschatology has relation to the whole universe, its creation, destination and renovation, and the ultimate end of all things. The first aspect and matters relevant to it from the ancient Indian point of viow will be dealt with in this section and the second aspect of Eschatology is reserved for treatment in a later section. In ancient works far more emphasis was laid on the first than on the second, while modern men with a more or Jess scientific outlook and attitude are inclined to think more of the second aspect.</p>
<p>Death has been generally looked upon with feelings of awe and terror, though there were men (often philosophically minded) who looked upon it as a blessing and as a release of the spirit from the shackles imposed upon the latter by the body. The terror of death was in many cases due not so much to the pain</p>
<p>1.80</p>
<p>(Vol.</p>
<p>caused at the time of death but rather to the mystery that sur rounds what happens after death and to the thoughts about what the survivors would have to undergo. It is said by O E. Vulliamy in his work &lsquo;Inmortal man&rsquo; (p. 2): ‘although the idea of that life (ghostly life) ranges from the most disma) and horri ble fantasies to the most sublime imaginations, the fundamental thought is always the same, the body dies but not the spirit&rsquo;. There were several attitudes adopted by primitive as well as ojvilized people towards death. In the Kathopanisad we road (I. 1.20 ) When a man dies there is a doubt, some saying that there is survival after the death of the body and some denying any survival' and Naciketas requests the dreaded God Yama to solve this doubt. There are several beliefg421a ayon among those who hold that there is survival after death. Some say that there is a world of the dead to which whatever survives goes after death Others believe that the surviving part goes to Heaven or Hell according as the man has been virtuous or sinfu) in his life on earth. Others believe in transmigration and re-incarnation, Several of the great writers in anoient Greece believed in this last doctrine, as Pindar (in second Olympian Ode), Plato (in Phaedrus and Timaeus) and Herodotus (II. 123) indicate.</p>
<p>The Brahmapurana (chap. 214 verses 34–39) sets out the Persons to whom death is happy and easy and not a source of misory and sorrow. A few may be mentioned hera.-&lsquo;He who did not tell lies, he who did not prove false to affection or friendship, who is an āstıka (a believer in God and the life to come), who is devoted to the worship of gods and the honouring of brāhmanas, ha who does not bear malice to anyone-these have a happy death,&rsquo; Similarly, the Anusāsanaparva of the Mahābhārata (chap. 104. 11-12, chap. 144 49-60) states at Jength the causes of prema ture death and of long life. Some of them may be translated here. Those who are atheists, do not perform the acts (or sacrifices) proper for them, violate the (diotates of) elders and of sāstras, who do not know what dharma is and are evil-doors are short-lived. Those who have no character, who always braak all rules of conduct, who have promiscuous sexual inter Course become short-lived and go to Hell. One who is not irritable by tempor, speaks the truth, does not cause injury to baings, who bears no malice to any one and who is not crooked—those live for a hundred years' (104. 11-12 and 14).</p>

<p>Signs of Approaching Death Several works specify the signs indicative of the approach of death. The Santiparva of the Mahābhārata (chap. 318. 9-17), Dayala quoted in the Moksakānda of the Kalpataru (pp. 248-250, about 20 verges), the Vāyupurāna (chap. 19 verses 1~32), the Mārkandeyapurāna 43. 1-33 (chap. 40 verses 1-33, Venkatesvara Press ed.), Lingapurāna (pārvārdha chap. 91) and other Purāpas contain long lists of the signs of appr02 ching death. It is impossible for want of space to set out in detail these signs. But the gist of a few verses is mentioned by way of sample. The Sāntiparva (chap 318) states that a dian who is not able to see the star of Arundhati which he could for morly see, nor the pole-star nor the full moon, nor his own reflec tion in another man&rsquo;s eye has only one year to live; he has only a span of six months of life left to him who sees the orb of the moon with a hole in it; a man has only seven days left of life who sees a bole pierced in the orb of the Sun, who smells the odour of a corpse when fragrant substances are near; when the nose and ears bend down, when his teeth and eyes become discoloured, when there is loss of consciousness, and loss of bodily heat, when smoke emerges from the crown of the head, when the left eye begins to ooze moisture all of a sudden these are indications of the immediate approach of death. Davala states indications that prognosticate life for only one year, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2 months, one month, half a month, 12 days, 4 days, 3 days, 2 days and winds up by saying that one who cannot hear the humming sound in his ear (when closed with fingers) or cannot see the light in the eye is going to die immediately. The Vāyupurana (19.28) and Lingapurāda 91.30 regard the last two as the worst indications of approaching death 433. The Lingapurāna (pūrvabhāga chap. 91.%t) states that he who cannot see his own reflection in another&rsquo;s eye will not live. There is an interesting paper by Dr R.G. Harshe in the Munshi Diamond Jubilee volume (pp. 246-268) where the learned writer gives the text of two moss, on the prognostications derived from dreams e. g. if a man sees an ass in a dream he is sure to die, or if he sees an old maid then it is an indication of danger, disease and death (p. 251) or if he sees a trident death is indicated (p. 254).</p>

<p>I Vol. When a man is sinking and is almost on the point of death it was and even now is the practice in many parts of India to take the dying man down from the bedstead and place him on &amp; bed spread on the earth424 For example, the Kausika-sūtra (803) prescribes 925 : When the man is losing all strength, he (the son or other attending relative) spreads Tuśas on the grass growing in the shed and takes him down (from the bed-stead) with the manira &lsquo;syonāsmai bhava&rsquo; (mayst thou be good to this man, Oh Earth). The Baud P S III 1 18 says that sand should be spread on the ground in the sacrificial shed when it is feared that the sacrificer is dying and darbha grass should be strewn on the sand with the sharp ends turned to the south and the dying man should be placed thereon and one (son or the like) should repeat in his right ear the anuvāka beginning with ayusah prānam santanu'. The Gobhilasmrti III. 2% and later works lika the Pitrdayita provide the same procedure.</p>
<p>Medieval digests like the Suddhiprakāśa (pp 151–152) stata that when a person is moribund, has half closed his eyes and is taken down on the ground (from a bed-stead), his son or other relative should make him giya one or more of ten gifts viz of cows, 426 land, segame, gold, clarified butter, clothes, grain, jaggery, silver, salt These gifts are superior even to a śrāddha performed at Gayā or to oven hundreds of Aśvamedhas.

After the ten danas, a cow with &amp; calf should be donated if possible 427 (this cow being called utkrānta-dhenu &ldquo;a cow donated in view of death&rsquo;) and then another cow called Vaitaraps with gold (or two pieces of cloth &amp;c) should be donated. The Antyestipaddhati and the Suddhi prakāśa (pp. 152-153) set out all the mantras (not vodic) that are to be recited at the time of making the several gifts, which (nantras) are passed over here for want of space. The Antyesti paddhati, the Antyabarmadīpaka and other works prescribe that when a person is near death, his son or other relative should make him perform Vratodyāpana, sarvaprayascitta and the gift of ten danas or if the dying man is unable to do these himself, the son or the other relative should perform these and give the merit thereof to the dying man. A person often resolyes upon observing certain vratas, but fails to carry out all the details of those vratas to the end. The Vratodyāpana for the dying man is meant to cure all such unfinished vratas, The A. K.D. (pp. 3-4) has a long note about the performance of vratodyāpana. Briefly it comes to this. The son or other rolativa having brought about the purity of the dying man&rsquo;s body by a bath or by sprinkling it with holy water (mārjana) or by making him drink Ganges water, having himself taken a bath and perform ed his daily duties (of sandhyā). having lighted a lamp, having bowed to Ganeśa and prayed to god Vispu, having placed before him the materials of worship and having repeated the usual saṅkalpa ( see note 128), he should honour a brāhmapa</p>

<p>Thoughts of a dying man</p>

<p>down for what is called aturasannyāsa he never returns to the cycle of births and deaths,</p>
<p>From ancient times it was a firmly held belief that the thoughts that a dying man entertains at the time of death determine what will happen to his spirit after physical death (this is expressed in the well-known words &lsquo;aats natih sā, gatih&rsquo;), that therefore a man should, when death approaches, give up all thoughts of mundane affairs and all earthly attachments, should think of his favourite deity. (Hari or Siva), should inaudibly recite such mantras as &ldquo;om namo Vāgudevāya&rsquo;. Several texts insist on making the dying man listen to holy Vedic texts. The Gautamapitr-Inedhasūtra (1.1-8) prescribes that one should at the time when one&rsquo;s father, mother, brother, teacher or a brāhmana friend is on his death-bed make the dying man hear the first and last verses of the Veda and certain sūmans and should mutter in the dying man&rsquo;s right ear (one sāman) The Rgvidhāna provides that one should repeat at the time of death the sākta beginning with &lsquo;trātāram&rsquo; 431 (7)</p>
<p>The Hir. P. S. I. 1 provides that when it is thought that the ālutāgnı is going to die, he (the son or the like) should mutter in the dying man&rsquo;s ear (if he is a knower of Brahma) the two anuvākas of the Tai. Up. II. 1 (beginning with &lsquo;brahmavidāpnoti param&rsquo;) and II. 1 (beginning with &lsquo;Bhrgurvai vārupih&rsquo;). The A. K. D. (P 18) says 432 that if the dying man is unable to engage in japa he should revolve in his mind the benign form of Vispu or Siva and should listen to the thousand names (of Vispu or Siva), the Bhagavadgitā, the Bhagavata, Bhārata, Rāmāyada, the Upanisads like Lāāvāsya and hymns to Soma,</p>

<p>Vol. The germs of this idea are found even in the Upanisads, The Chāndogya Up. (in the famous Sandilya-vidyā, III, 14, 1) romarks &lsquo;All this is Brahman. A man should meditate on that (all this) as beginning, ending and subsisting in it (Brahman). Now man is a creature of his w]] According to whatever is his vill (or thought) in this world, so will he become after departing from this world.&rsquo; 433 The Praśna Up. II, 10 contains Q similar idea. It is here asserted that it is thought power or the will that raises the soul higher and higher, and that the human mind should try to realize the idea that behind all physical transformations the Universe is one and is informed by one all-pervading Essence. Similarly, the Bhagavadgita puts this idea in a much more clear way. The man, who romeinbering me alone in his last moments, departs from this life, comes to mo, there is no doubt about this&rsquo; ( 8,5). But in order to guard against the possible inference that it is only the thoughts at the approach of death that matter whatever the past life led by a dying man may have been, the next verse emphasizes that a man&rsquo;s spirit is engrossed by the thoughts that he has entertained throughout life and that a man can think of spiritual matters or about God at the time of death only if he has been thinking about such matters or about God throughout his life That verse (8.6) is &lsquo;whichever form (or thing) a man remembers when he leaves the body at death, to that alone he goes, having been always (throughout his life) engrossed in meditating over it&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some of the digests, on the authority of several Puranas, prescribe that the dying man should be taken, if possible, near a holy place (tirtha) such as the Ganges. For example, the Suddhitattva434 (p 299) quotes a passage from the Kūrmapurana to this effect &lsquo;a man attains mohsa (final release from samsūra) by dying in the waters of the Ganges, on land or in water at</p>

<p>Vārānasi (Benares) and at the confluence of the Ganges with the sea either on land, in water or in the air.&rsquo; Another passage to the same effect is quoted from the &lsquo;Skanda-purāda and it is further said in the same Purāda that for one gavyūti from the banks of the Ganges is a kṣetra (holy place): &lsquo;gifts, japa (mut tering of sacred texts), homa performed within this extent is equal to doing the same on the Ganges itself, those who die within this kṣeira go to heaven and are not born again. In the Pujāratnākara 435 it is said: &lsquo;Hari is present wherever there is the Salagrāma stone; one dying near ā sālagrāma stone reaches the highest abode of Viṣṇu&rsquo;. It was said that a person (even a non-Aryan) dying within one krosa of a Salagrāma reaches Vaikuntha (world of Visou) Similarly, one dying in a garden of tulasi (Basil) plants or with Tulasi leaf placed in his mouth at the time of death attains moksa even if guilty of crores of sins. These are popular notions held even up to this day among common people, not thoroughly affected by modern ideas.</p>
<p>There are also dicta about the time when it is best to die. The Santiparva of the Mahābhārata states the who dies after the sun has gone to the northern direction (i. e, when the apparent motion of the sun towards the north begins ) and on any auspicious naksatra and muhurta is really one who has a store of merit (with him ) ' 436 This is based on the ideas of death in Uttarayana and Dakṣiṇāyana found in the Upanisads. For example, the Chandogya Up. (IV. 15. 5-6 ) states &ldquo;Now ( if one who knows this dies) whe ther people perform obsequies for him or not he goes to light (arcus ), from light to day, from day to the bright half of the moon, from thence to the six months during which the sun goes to the north, from the months to the year, from the year to the sun, fron the sun to the moon, from the moon to</p>

<p>[Vol. lightning. There is a person who is not human that leads them to Brahman, This is the path of the Devas, the path that leads to Brahman. Those who proceed on that path do not return to the life of man, yes, they do not return&rsquo;. There is a similar passage in Chandogya Up. V. 10.1-2 where it is said that even householders who know the doctrine of the five fires (Pancūgni-indya) and those who in the forest follow the path of faith and austerities (i, e. vānap asthas and parivrājakas wbo do not yet know Highest Brahman) go by the path called Devayāna, while (V, 10. 3—?) those, who, living in a village, practise . sacrifices, works of public utility and alms, go to smoke, from smoke to night, from night to the dark half of the inoon, from thence to the six months when the sun goes to the south, from thence to the worlds of the fathers, from thence to ether (ahasa) and to the moon, where they consume their works and return again the way they came. The Chān Up. (V, 10. 8) refers to &amp; third place where small creatures (like flies, worms &amp;c.) are continually going and returning. The Br. Up. (VL 2. 15-16 ) contains similar passages about Davaloka, Pitrloka and the third world of worms, birds and creeping beings. The Bhagavadgita, basing itself on these Upanisad passages, puts the matter succinctly (in 8 23-25) as follows:-&lsquo;I shall state the times at which devotees departing from this world go, never to return or to return, The fire, the flame, the day, the bright fortnight, the six months of the northern (apparent) motion of the sun; departing from the world in these those who know the Brahman go to Brahman. Smoke, night, the dark fortnight, the six months of the southern (apparent) motion of the sun; dying in these the devotee goes to the lunar light and returns. These two paths, bright and dark, are deemed to be eternal in this world. By the one a man goes never to raturn, by the other he comes back&rsquo;. The Vedānta sūtra (IV, 3 4-6) explains that the words &lsquo;light&rsquo; &lsquo;day&rsquo; and others are not to be taken in their literal sonse (i, e. as signposts or stages on the paths) but they are to be understood as referr. ing to superintending deities that help the spirits and lead them on the path to the worlds of the Devas or of Pitrs (i e. they are ātrvālekas and abhımānidevatās). Saṅkara on Vedāntasūtra IV. 2. 20 (ataścāyanepi daksine) explains that the waiting for the -day of Uttarāyada on the part of Bhisma (narrated in the Mahābhārata) is only meant as a eulogy of the path called ,&rsquo; arcirādi&rsquo;, that one who has realized Brahma, even if he dies in dakṣipāyana, does secure the fruits of his knowledge (viz.</p>

The Yajāavalkya-smrti refers to the path (devayāna) 437 that leads to Devaloka (in III. 193-194, where it reads &lsquo;mānasah&rsquo; for *amānavah&rsquo; of the Ch. Up.) and the Pitryāpa (in II, 195-196). In spite of the interpretations of the Vedāntasūtra (and of Saṅkara) the popular belief that death in Uttarāyana is best persisted and still persists. For example, the Baud, P.S.(IL.7, 21 ) remarks &lsquo;(the sages) provide that death during the northern path of the sun, in the bright half of a month, during the day and at the end of a Srauta sacrifice is best43&rsquo; The G. P. S. (II. 7.1-2) remarks: &lsquo;It is desirable to avoid dying in the dark half of a month or at night and the following sūtras provide for the offering of certain oblations if the death occurs in the dark half or at night,</p>

VII 38 8 also has a similat idea &lsquo;may you, being gratified, go by the devayāna paths&rsquo; (trpta yatam pathibbır-devayānaih). In Rg-VII 76.2 (addressed to Usas) the sage Vasistha exclatus that he has seen the Devayāna paths when the dawn shone in the East (pra me pantbā devagāba adrsrap). Agai is asked to make the devayāna paths easily accessible and to carry the offerings in a pleased mood (Rg. X 51.5, sugāa pathaḥ krnuhi devagādāa vaha havyāni samanasyamīdah) Rg. X 98 11 describes Ayni us knowlog the devayāna paths according to the seasons and a prayer is offered to bim to place Aulāda (son of Santanu) in heaven among the gods (vidvan patha stuśo devayābān-apyanlānam divi deyesu dhebi). In R8. X 18.1 it is stated that the path of Death is different from devayāna (paran mrlyo ang parehı paotham yaste sva itaro devayānāt). In Rg X 2.7 Agai is said to know the patryāna path (panthamanu pra vidvan pitryānam). In the Ta. Br II 6 3 5 it is said &lsquo;I have heard of two paths of the Fathers; I bave heard about the paths of the gods and mortals&rsquo; (dve sruti aśroavata pitrpām abam devādām-uta martyādātu), The Sat Br. I 9.3 2 remarks &ldquo;this is the path called Devayāna or Pitryāda.&rsquo; In the Br, Up. 1.5.16 it is said &lsquo;there are indeed three worlds, viz. the world of men, the world of putrs and the world of gods&rsquo;.</li>

<p>performed with Vedic mantras according to Manu I. 16, Yāj. I 10, Jātūkarnya439. These samskāras were formerly performed for women also (Āśv gc I 15.12, L 166, 1. 17-11, Manu I. 66) but sithout Vedic mantras (except in marriage) and for sūdras algo (Manu X, 127, Yāj I. 10) but without Vedic mantras. The Baud. P.S. III, 1.4 states that there are two samskāras of every human being and they are like a debt i e. they must be fer formed, just as a debt must be discharged viz the samskāra on birth and the one on death (mrtasamskāra). Funeral rites and rites after death varied according as the deceased was an abitāgni (one who had consecrated the śrauta fires) or one who had only kindled the smārta fire, or one who had peither the śrauta fires nor the smārta fire, or a woman, a child, ad ascetic (parıvrājaha), or one dying in a distant land or one dying by accident or committing suicide &amp;c. The srauta and grbya gūbras differ among themselves in many details eten on the same topic and the procedure becomes more elaborate in medieval and later times. It would be impossible to state all the differences on each topic in this section. A separate yojume would have to be written for the purpose of setting out all the variations and. additions from ancient times to modern times, to discuss why and how they arose or vere made, to compare the various sūtras and to compare these again with the puranas and medieval digests, and to appraise their worth or usefulness, All that can be attempted here is to give the bare outlines of the procedure in different sūtras, smrtis and digests by way of sample in a chronological order. The Nirnayasindhu (p. 569 ) expressly says that the last rites differ in each Sabha, though certain things are common to all 439 Chronological conclusions have been drawn about the relative ages of the sātras ( as Dr. Caland does), of the smrtis, purāpas and nibandhas from the presence or absence of this or that detail or the elaboration of this or that ritual But with *all respect to the industrious scholars of the West such conclu sions are often tentative or misleading and are purely subjec tive in many cases and are often due to ignorance or loss of , ancient works,</p>

<p>191 Before setting out the rites of cremation contained in the Śrauta sūtras, Grhya sūtras and later works, it would be best to give hero a translation of the five hymns from the Rg. (X. 14-18) 40. The verses in these hymns are employed by most of the sūtras and are used even now in the cremation rites and most of them about in the other Vedic Samhitās. Varying interpretations have been given of some of these stanzas by Indian and Western commentators and critics Only a few of these have been mentioned in the notes. Besides some stanzas are employed for different details of the cremation rites by the different sūtras All such differencos cannot be set out for want of space. The five hymns are so placed that they follow · the order of the stages in which the funeral ritual proceeded in fact and is performed aven now to a great extent.

Many of the customs and beliefs that be records bear a close resemblance to customs and beliefs in ancient and modern India, such, as, for example, the alighting of a raven or other black feathered bird on a cottage where a mad is very ill as a death waraing (p 17), washing and anointing of dead bodies before burial (pp. 34, 36), the hinag of professional women for wailiog and sbriek lag for the dead (p 67), condemning burial at night (p 77), the cutting of the hair as a sign of mourning (p. 91). placiog meat and driok on the grave for the spirit of the departed (pp 99-100), refusal of burial in the church yard by the Church for unbaptised children, suicides, lunatics, and those excommunicated (p. 143).</p>

(O departed !) proceeding by a good path, hurry on past the two dappled dogs (of Yama), offspring of Saranā, each having four eyes. Thus approach the pitrs who will recognize 449 you and who enjoy delight in the company of Yama 11. O king Yama! Give him (the departed one) in charge of those two dogs of yours, who are guards, having four eyes each, who guard the path (to pitr-loka) and who watch men. May you bestow on him happiness and health! 1%. The two messengers of Yama, that have wide nostrils, that are very strong, that are satisfied with difficulty, move among the people. May those two (messengers) restore to us to-day auspicious life in order that we may see the Sun 1 450 13. Extract Soma juice for Yama (O priests !), offer oblation to Yama.451 Sacrifice, in which Agni is messenger (carrier) to the gods and which is well prepared reaches Yama, 14. (O priests) offer oblation sprinkled with ghee to Yama and then start. May he keep us (tied) to the &lsquo;worship of gods, 452 so that we may live a long life! 15. Offer to king Yama an oblation which is extremely sveet. Here is salutation to the sages who were born before us and who made the path for us,</p>

<p>It should be noted that the word &lsquo;pitr-yajāa&rsquo; actually occurs in Rg. X. 16. 10. What does it mean? It has to be remembered that the hymns Rg. X. 15-18 refer to rites immediately on the death of a single person. They are not concerned with rites performed for deceased male ancestors long after their deaths. The anxiety (in X. 15-18) seems to be to make the ancient pitrs (styled Barhisadaḥ and Agnisvāttāḥ in Rg. X. 15. 3-4, 11) favourably disposed to the recently departed spirit. Havis (sacrifical food such as boiled rice) was offered to the ancient pitrs (Rg. X 15, 11) who were supposed to have partaken of the food offered (X. 15. 12). The purpose of these Rgvedic hymns is entirely different from the purpose of the mantras in Tai, S. I, 8.5 (which refer to the pitryajāa performed in Sākamedha), As a matter of fact three of the mantras in Tai. S. I. 8.5 do occur in Rg. X. 57. 3.5 and are employed in the piṇda-pitryajña, There is hardly any reason to suppose that the pitryajña in Rg. X. 15. 10 is more ancient than the piṇdapibryajña, It is quite possible that both referring as they do to different matters were coeval.</p>

The idea probably is that the speaker wants to disconnect himself from the dead just as a feather may become loosened from as artos that is sbot and therefore he states that he wants to stop addressing the dead and close up all connection with the dead.

<p>It would be interesting to see how the ceremonies on the death of an āhutāgni are described in the srauta and grhya sūtras. The Aśv. Sr. S. VI. 10 describes what is to be done in case one that has undergone a dīkṣā (initiation) for a Soma sacrifice or a sattra dies before the sacrifice is finished. It states &ldquo;When the diksita is dead, they take out the body by the tin tha, 480 place it on the spot where it was intended that avabhrtha (bath at the end of a soma or sattra sacrifice) was to be taken and deck the body with the decorations that ordinarily are placed on a dead body. They cut the hair (on the head) of the corpse, the hair on the lips, the hair on the body and also pare the nails, They apply paste of Nalada (Indian spikenard) to the corpse and throw on it a garland of naladas. Some (having cut open the entrails) take out the feca) matter from them and fill them with prsadājya ( when clarified butter is mixed with curds it is so called ). They cut off a portion as wide as the foot of the corpse from a now ( unworn ) garment and cover the dead body with it in such a way that the fringe is towards the vest (the head being placed towards the east) and the feet of the corpse are exposed to view. The portion cut off from the piece of cloth is taken by the sons and the like. The deceased man&rsquo;s srauta fires are placed on the churning sticks.( the two aranis), the dead body is taken outside the vedi (fire altar) towards its south, fire is produced by attrition and then the body is burnt therewith. After returning from the cremation, they should finish the work of the day. On the next morning, the recitation of the śāstras, the singing of the stotras and the samstavas (reciting hymns in chorus) should be without repetition and the uttaring of the hum sound. On the same day before taking up the granas (cups), the priests come out by the tirtha, go round the place of cremation with the right hand turned away (from the place ) and sit round it in the following manner viz. the hotr priest sits to the west ( of the place of cremation ), tho adhvaryu to the north, and the sāma priests to the west of the adhvaryu (and the brahmā priest to the south). Then the Sāma priests sing in a low voice the verse beginning with &ldquo;ayam gauh prśnirakramīt&rsquo; When the singing is finished the hoto walks round the place of cremation thrice with his lett</p>

The piece of land dug up should be of the length of a man with upraised arms, of the breadth of one vyama-83 and one vrtasta (twelve finger breadths) in depth. The cemetery (smaśāna) should484 be free (open) on all sides. It should abound in herbs, but plants with thorns and with milky juice (should be dug out) as stated before (in Aśy. gr.

From which the waters flow on all sides (that is the spot should be a little higher than the surrounding ground); this should be a characteristic required for that kind of) cemetery where (the body) is to be burnt. They should cut off the hair on the head, the lips and the body and pare the nails (of the deceased); this has been declared already (in Āśy, Śr. VI. 10.2).

Compare Sat Br. XII 5, 9-12 for similar remarks. Aśv.

On that pile he spreads kusa grass and over the latter black antelope skin with the hair outside Then the corpse is oarried to the north of the fire and is placed on the funeral pile with the head to the south. To the north of the dead body, he makes the wife of the deceased sit down. Then the husband&rsquo;s brother, pupil or an old servant makes her get up with the mantra &lsquo;udīrsva&rsquo; (Rg.

He then throws on the body of the departed sesame anointed with ghee, he performs parısamuhana (wiping with the wet hand) of the fire, then paristarana (strewing darbha grass) round the fire together with the funeral pile) and paryuksana (sprinkling water) and brings to the south of the fire the vessels viz proksani, sruya, camasa and the vessel containing clarified butter. Then he puts water in the camasa (oup), covers it with darbha grass and carries it forward and invokes the camasa with Rg.

<p>Many rules were prescribed as regards the carrying of the dead body. It has been seen above that the corpse was carried in a cart or on a couch by the relatives or by the ser yants (dāsas). Some sūtras, spirtis, commentaries and other works lay down many other rules hera The Rāmāyada (Ayodhya 76. 13 ff) states that on the death of Dasaratha his Vedic fires were carried by his priests before the corpse, that the dead body was placed in &amp; palanquin (Sibika), that his servants carried it and that coins of gold and clothes vora thrown about on the road in front of the bier (for the pour), The general rule was that members of the three higaer vardas alone should carry to the cemetery a dead body belonging to any one of those vargas and a śūdra should not carry the dead body of a man of a higher casto (when there vore mon of the caste of the dead available) nor should a man of one of the threa higher varṇas carry the dead body of a sudra, in that the impurity in the case of a sūdra carrying a 1840 dvijātı or a duzzati carrying a sūdra&rsquo;s body is determinou by the caste of the dead man, Vida Visau Dh S 19 1-4, Gaut, Dh.

<p>by Yaj. I 34-35. If a brahmacārin carried the corpse of any one except the above five he was held to have swerved from his vrata and he had to undergo the expiation for trafalopa, Manu 5, 103 and Yāj. II 13-14 state that those who merely carry a dead body of their own caste should bathe with the clothes on, then bite off nimba leaves, should perform acamana, touch fire, water, cowdung, white mustard, place slowly a foot on a stone and then enter their house It being the duty of sapindas 501 to carry the dead body of their relative they, after doing so, had simply to bathe, to touch fire and drink clarified butter for being pure (Gaut. 14, 29. Yāj. IL. 26, Manu IV. 103. Parāśara II. 42, Devala q. by Par. M. 1 %, p. 277, Harīta q. by Aparārka p. 871). Carrying the dead body of a brāhmaga who has no relatives is highly extolled by Parāśara (III 39-41) who says that a person, that thus carries the dead body of a brāh mapa, secures at each footstep the reward of the performance of a sacrifice and he becomes pure at oncs simply by plunging into water and performing prādāyāma, while Manu (5. 101–102) prescribes that if one carries the dead body of a person who is not a sapında through affection he becomes pure after three days. The Hāralatā p. 121 quotes the Adipurāda that if a ksatriya or vaisya cremates the dead body of a poor brahmana or of a ksatriya who has lost everything or of a poor Faiśya, he secures great merit and becomes pure at once after a bath. Even now generally (particularly in villages) men of the same caste carry or follow a dead body and are held to be purified by a bath with clothes on. The medieval commentaries like the Mitakṣarā stuck strictly to the extreme exclusiveness of caste by prescribing &lsquo;if a man sua carries a dead body through affection, eats food in that family and dwells in their house he is under impurity for ten days; if he simply stays with the dead man&rsquo;s family but does not eat their food he is impure for three days; these rules apply when the carrier is of</p>

<p>the same caste as the dead person But if a brāhmana carries a Śūdra&rsquo;s corpse, the brāhmana is impure for a month, but if &amp; Śūdra carries a brāhmana&rsquo;s body the sūdra is impure for ten days. The Kūrmapurāda prescribes that if a brāhmana carries the dead body of a brāhmana for a fee or from other interested motive he becomes impure for ten days, a ksatriya, vaisya and sūdra doing the same becomes impure for 1%, 15 or 30 days and the Vispupurāpa says that the person carrying a dead body for a fee has to become impure for the period of impurity prescribed for a man of that caste, It may be stated that these rules about impurity on the ground of carrying or following the carrying of a dead body of another caste are no longer enforced and it is extremely doubtful whether they were ever strictly enforced or followed Harsta 503 prescribes that a dead body should not be carried through the midst of a village if wbile going to the cemetery a village comes in the way, but it should be carried away from it. Manu, 592 and Vrddha-Hārīta IX, 100-101 prescribed that the dead body of a śūdra, vaisya, ksatriya and a brāhmana was to be taken out respectively by the southern, western, Dorthern and eastern gates of the town or village It was provided by Yama and the Garudapurāna II 4 56-57 504 that the fuel for the funeral pyre should not be carried (for higher varṇas) to the cemetery by a sūdra and if a śūdra did so the deceased would always remain in the state of preta The Hāralatā (p 121) says that if firewood is carried by sūdras still the pyre should be made by brāhmanas only (for a brāhmapa&rsquo;s body). The smrtis and purāpas provide that the corpse 505 should be first bathed with water and then cremated, that the corpse should never be burned naked, but that it should be covered with cloth, decked with flowers and have fragrant unguents (sandalwood</p>

<p>The Brahmapurāpa (q. by Suddhiprakaśa p. 159) states that when carrying a dead body to the cemetery, a great deal of noise should be created by means of the four kinds of instru. ments. 506</p>
<p>There were differing rules laid down about rapana (shaving) for the performer as an auxiliary (anga) of the rite of cremation, after the cremation and bath thereafter. A smrti text provides 507</p>
<p>shaving of the head and moustaches is declared in seven cases, viz. on the Ganges, at the Bhāskaraksetra, on the death of the mother or father or guru, on consecrating the frauta fires and in a Soma sacrifice&rsquo;. The A KD (p. 19) prescribes that the son or other performer of the rites of cremation should first perform vapana and thep bathe, then carry the dead body to a sacred spot, bathe it there, or if such a spot is not at hand should invoke the presence of the Ganges, Gayā and other tirthas in the water to be used for washing the dead body, then anoint it with ghee or sesame oil, again bathe it and put on it a fresh garment, should deck it with yarnopavīta, gopicandana, garland of basil leaves and then should apply to the wbole body fragrant subst. ances like sandalwood paste, camphor, saffron, musk &amp;c. But if the cremation took place at night, there was to be no vapana at night, but on the next day.508 Other smrtis allowed vapana on the 2nd, 3rd, 5th or 7th or any following day up to the offering of śrāddha on the 11th day.509 Áp Dh, S.

<p>provides sio zapana for all sapindas that are younger than the deceased The Madanapārijāta holds that the performer of orema. tion rites had to undergo vapana on the first day and also on the expiry of the period of impurity, while the Suddhiprakasa (p 162) following the Mit on Yāj. ITI 17 states that the day on which vapana is to be undergone is determined by the usage of each country. This difference in usages has been even judicially noticed. In Chandra choora Deo v. Brbhuti Bhushan Deva A,I R. 1945 Patna p. 211 at p. 219 it has been stated that according to the Benares School the person who performs the cremation shayes his head at the time of cremation, whereas under the Mithilā school there is no such shaving at that time.</p>
<p>The Garudapurāpa (II. 4. 67-69) provides that loud weeping may be indulged in when the body is burning but there should be no weeping after cremation and the offering of water to the departed,</p>
<p>There was some difference of opinion as to the offering of water (udakakriyā or udakadana) to the deceased by his sapindas and samānodaloas ĀŚy gr, quoted above (p 209) speaks of offering water once, but the Sat, Śr 28 2. 72 and others prescribe that water mixed with sesame is offered thrice with joined hands on the day of death to the deceased after reciting his gotra and name and every day thereafter up to the 11th,511 Gaut Dh. S. 14. 38, Vas. 4 12 presoribe that water should be offered by sapindas to the deceased with their faces to the south on the first, third, seventh and ninth days of death and Haradatta says that in all 75 añjalis of water were to be offered (threa on 1st day, 9 on 3rd, 30 on 7th and 33 on 9th ), but that the usage in bis country was that on the first day water was offered three times with joined hands and then one more anjali on each succeeding day from the 2nd.

<p>Views on offering water prescribe that water and pinda were to be offered to the deceased for ten days.512 The Suddhiprakāśa (p. 202 ) quotes Terses from Gphyd-pariśista, one of which says that some declare that only ten añjalis were to be offered, some say 100 Tere to be offered and others that 55 vere to be offered and that one should follow the usage settled in one&rsquo;s vedic Sākha. The ĀŚv. gr. parisista 3. 4 has &amp; similar rule in prose The Garudapurāna (Pretakhanda chap. 5 yerses 22-23 ) also refers to the offering of 10, 55, or 100 anjalis. Some smrtis prescribed that the number of añjalis of water were dependent on the caste of the deceased. Pracetas (q. by Mit. on Yāj. ITI. 4) provides that 10, 12, 15, 30 añjalis should be respectively offered to a deceased person of the brahmana, ksatriya, vaisya or sūdra Varna, Yama (verses 92-94 ) states how water is to be offered to the deceased standing in navel-deep vater and (98) pre scribes that water is to be offered in water to gods and pitis but on the ground to those that died without upanayana being performed. In a smrti quoted by Devayājnika 513 it is stated that six pindas Tere to be offered from the day of death as follows: at the place where the death occurred, at the door of the house, where four roads meet, where the funeral procession on the way to the cemetery rested, on the pile of Food arranged for burning (cita), and at the time of the collection of the burnt bones. It was further provided that for the benefit of the departed a lamp fed by sesame oil was to be kept burning continuously for ten days after death and an earthenware Yessel was to be kept filled with water and a handful of cooked rice was to be offered on the ground at the time of the mid-day meal after uttering the name and gotra of the departed. This was called pātheya śrāddha because it helped the departed to go on his way from the earth to the world of the departed (Tide Dharmasindhu p 463). According to some of the digests</p>

<p>History of Dharmaśāstra ( toi.</p>
<p>a śrāddha called Nagna-pracchadana was to be performed on the day of the death of a person after his sapindas undergo sharing and bath, enter the village and the house. It consists in filling a jar with grains of rice wound round with a piece of oloth and putting clarified butter in a vessel of bell-metal and some gold (or coins) thereon according to one&rsquo;s ability. The whole was to be given to a poor brāhmada of good family after romembering Visou for the benefit of the departed Vide Smrtı muktāphala (on śr ) pp. 595-596, Sm C (on Aśauca p. 176 ),</p>
<p>PACCORDI Pere death sticke be left the offered pars to be upana</p>
<p>The smrtis and purānas (like Kūrma, uttarārdha 23.70 ) prescribe that after offering with joined hands water to the deceased a ball of rice or barley flour with sesame was to be presented on darbha grass There are two views on this point, According to Ya. III, 16 a pinda vas to be offered for three days after death according to the procedure prescribed for Pinda-pitr-yajña (such as wearing of the sacred thread on the right shoulder and under the left shoulder ), while according to Vispu 19. 13 one pinda was to be offered every day as long as impurity on death lasted The pinda was to be offered on darbhas spread on the ground if the deceased had his upanayana performed, but without mantras or may be offered on a stone sly While water could be offered by any and every sapinda, pioda was to be offered only by the son (and when there were many sons, by the eldest if free from defect); in default of a son the nearest sapinda like a brother or brother&rsquo;s son was to offor it and in default of such then the sapindas of the mobbet (materna) uncle, his son or the like ) could 515 offer it. Even when pindas were to be offered for three days or āśauca lasted only for 3 days the pipdas were prescribed to be ten by Satatapa and Paraskara distributed them as follows three on the irsu day, four on the 2nā and 3 on the third and Dakga *** d1801)* buted them as follows. one on the first day, four on the 2nd and fiya on the 3rd Paraskara prescribed that 10, 12, 15, 30 pindas were to be offered according to the varṇa of the deceased i the case cited above from A I R. 1945 Patna p 211 at p 219 jt has been stated that according to the Benares school 4, 5 oro</p>

<p>II Views on pinas at cremation</p>
<p>pindas are offered at the time of cremation, while according to the Mithilā&rdquo; school only. one pioda is offered. Everybody, whether a person of the same gotra as the deceased or of another gotra, had to carry out all the rites up to the tenth day wlien he once began them on the day of death, as stated by the Grhya-pariśista 517 and Garudapurāpa. It is further prescribed that when the funeral sites are begun by a person and then a nearer Telatiye such as a son comes, even then the former is to carry on all the rites up to the 10th day, but the rites of the 11th and later days are to be performed by the son and in default of him by a near sapinda. The Matsyapurāna states 518 that pindas should be offered to the deceased for twelve days; they become his food on his journey (to the other world) and they give bim satisfaction; since the deceased is taken to the abode of departed spirits after twelve days, he (his spirit) sees his house, sons and wife for twelve days Rsyaśroga quoted by Aparārka (p. 889 ) specifies the limbs of an ethereal body with which the deceased is endowed on each day of the ten days after death when a pinda is offered The Garudapurāpa (pretakhanda chap. 5. 33-36) says the same.</p>
<p>Just as sapindas of the same gotra and samānodakas were bound to offer water to the deceased, &amp; person was bound to offer water to his maternal grandfather and to the two further ancestors and to his ācārya on their death. Every man, if he 80 desired (i. e, he was under no religious duty), could offer water to his friend, to his married sister or daugbter, to his sister&rsquo;s son, father-in-law and his sacrificial priest on their death (Pār. gr. III, 10, Saṅkha-Likhita, Yāj. 519 IL, 4) Paraskara (III. 10) refers to a peculiar practice. When the sapindas are about to enter water for bathing and thereafter offering water to the deceased they pray to their relatives or brother-in-law for water with the words &lsquo;we shall perform udakakriya , where-upon</p>

<p>the other roplios do so but don&rsquo;t come again (with a similar request),&rsquo; if the deceased was less than one hundred years of age, but the reply would be simply do so if the deceased Tas hundred years of age or more.520 The G. P. S. (1, 4,4-6) has &amp; somewhat similar symbolic dialogue. A king&rsquo;s officer, a sagotra or a brother-in-law takes a branch having thorns and provents them from entering water with the words &lsquo;don&rsquo;t enter&rsquo;; then the sapindas should reply &lsquo;we shall not again enter Water&rsquo;. The probable significance of this was that they thereby vould be able to escape from another death in the family soon after,</p>
<p>There were rules prohibiting certain persons from offering water to the deceased and also directing that water should not be offered to certain deceased persons. Impotent 521 persons and the like, thieves of gold, vrātyas, those who follow forbidden conduct and women that kill their own foetus or husband and that drink the kind of liquor (forbidden to them) should not offer water to a deceased person. Yaj (III. 6) provides that water should not be offered to and no āśauca observed for heretics, for those who do not belong to one of the four āśramas, to thieves, to women wao kill their husbands or who are guilty of prostitu tion or who drink surū, or who commit suicide. Manu (V. 89 90) is to the same effect, Gaut Dh, S. 522 14, 11 provides that in the case of those who start (through anger) on the Great</p>

<p>Journey, who commit suicide by fasting or by means of a weapon or by fire, by poison, in water, by hanging or falling from a precipice or tree, there is no oremation, no asauca, Do offering of water or pinda. Haradatta on Gazt, 14. 11 quotes three verses froni Brahmapurāpa that those who die of a brāhmana&rsquo;s curse or black magic and those who are patitas are dealt with in the same way. But Angiras (9. by Mit, on Ya). II, 6) says that if one dies by water or fire or the like through inadvertence, there was āśauca for him and udakakriya tras performed. Vide Vaik, Sm S. V. 11 for a long list of persons who must not be cremated. In the Mahābhārata the rites of cremation have been described frequently eg. the cremation of Pandu in Adiparva, chap 127 ( the body was carried in a frika covered on all sides, there were musical instruments, the royal parasol and chowries were carried in the procession, distribution of vealth to mendicants, carrying the dead body to the bank of the Ganges on a charming sylvan spot, bathing the body, applying sandalwood paste to it), of Drona in Strīparya, chap 23.38-42 (three samans were sung, his pupils with Dropa&rsquo;s wife in front vent round the funeral pyre, going to the Ganges ); of Bhisma in anusāsana 169 10-19 (fragrant resins were used on the pyre, his body was covered with fine clothes and flowers, an umbrella and chowries were held over the body, Kaurava vomen fanned the body with fans, sāmans vere sung ); of Vasudeva in Mausalaparva 7. 19-25; of killed Warriers in general in Striparya, chap. 26. 28-43 and of Kunti, Dhrtarāstra and Gandhārl in ' Aśramayasikaparya, chap. 39. In the Rāmāyana ( Ayodhyā, chap 76 verses 16-20 ), it is said that the funeral pyre for Daśaratha was made with sandalwood, aguru and fragrant resins, with Sarala, Padmaka and Devadāru (pine) wood and various fragrant substances were heaped thereon, then Daśaratha&rsquo;s body was placed on the pyre and that Kausalyā and other women followed the corpse in &amp;:blikās and conveyances aocording to their status,</p>
<p>If an āhitāgni died away from home, the Sat. Br. (XI, 5.1.13-14) provides that, having brought his bones home they were to be spread on a black antelope skin and arranged in imitation of the human frame, were to be covered with wool and ghee and burnt with his srauta fires and sacrificial imple ments.

<p>If even the bones could not be found, then the sūtras follorya ing the Azt Br. (chap. 32.1) and similar ancient workg523 provide that on a skin of black antelope one should make the effigy of a human frame with palāśa stalks (leaves) 360 in 521 pumber, the effigy should be bound round with woollen thread, should be covered with yava flour mixed with water and anointed witl clarified butter and cromated with his fires and sacrificial implements. The Brahmapurana (q. by Suddhi prakas&amp; p. 187) contains similar rules about burning an efigy and ordains three days&rsquo; impurity thereafter. Acc. to a smrti (a by Aparārka p. 545), the palūśa leaves were to be 362. They were to be distributed according to Baud. PS and Gaut. P S. as follows: 40 represent the bead, 10 the neck, 20 the chest, 30 the abdomen (udaa), 50 each of the arms, 10 the fingers of the two hands, 70 each of the two legs, 10 the toes of the feet, 8 the male organ, 12 the testicles. This is also the enumeration in Sat śr. 29.4.39. Vide also Śān, Śr. IV 15,19-31,52 Kāt. ŚT. XXV. 8.15, Baud, P. S. II 8, G. P.S.

It may be stated here that all the sūtras and smartis do not entirely agree as to the number of palāsa leaves taken as representing the several parts of the body, as may be seen from a comparison of the Sad, Sr. quoted in the note with Baud. P 8. set out here. A smrti quoted by Aparārka (p 545 ) gives the numbers as follows: 32 for the head, 60 for the neck, 80 for the chest, 20 for the hip and loins, 20 each for the two arms, 10 for fingers. 6 for testicles, 4 for the penis, 60 for the tio thighs, 20 for the knees, 20 for the</p>

Jātākarnya (a by Aparārka p. 545 ) and Bhavisyapurāpa (q. by Suddhi. prakāśa p. 187 ) say that when a son does not hear for 15 years about his father who had gone to a distant land, he should perform the cremation of the effigy (called &lsquo;akrtidahana&rsquo;). Bghaspati advises waiting for 12 years before resorting to akrtidalang (Suddhipr. p 187). The Vaikhānasa-sinārta-sutra V. 12 regards the burning of the effigy as a meritorious act for every one and does not restrict it to the case where the body or bones are not found. The Suddhiprakāśa p. 1897 quotes several Verses from the Brahmapurāpa that the procedure of burning an effigy of palāśa stalks was to be followed even in the case of one who has not consecrated Srauta fires and āśauca for three days has to be observed, while the aśauca for burning the effigy of an ābitagpi was ten days.</p>
<p>It is further provided in Sat śr. 29, 4. 41, Baud P.S. (II, 7. 4) and Garudapurāna II, 4. 169–70 that, if after the effigy is cremated in the belief that a person died in a foreign land, he returns alive, then he is plunged in a pit containing clarified butter and then he comes out of it, takes a bath, then all the sainskāras from jātalarına are performed on him, then be marrieg the same wife again or if she be dead, he may marry another girl, then consecrate again śrauta fires. Some sūtras provide that if the wife of an āhitāgni dies before him, he may, if he so desires, cremate her with his srauta fires or be may cremate her with fire prepared from covdung and some easily inflammable things (like straw) placed in three sthālis (cooking pots 526). Manu (V. 167-168) provides that if the savarṇa and virtuous wife of a twice-born person who had consecrated sacred srauta fires died before him she was to be cremated with big fires (srauta and smārta) and with the sacrificial implements. Then he may marry again and consecrate srauta or smārta fires again, To the same effect are Yā). T. 89, Baud.

<p>and Yama allows the recital of the Yamasūktā (Rg. X. 14) and the versos in honour of the god Yama, Manu V 70, however, states other optional provisions viz, that the offering of water may be done (and therefore the cremation also of the dead body) in the case of infants that have struck teeth or after nāmakar ana. Thereforo there is an option as to cre mating an infant of less than two years, viz it may be buried or cremated after nāmakarana or after the appearance of teeth. In this case it is not necessary that all the sapında relatives should follow the dead body If a child is two years old or more at death and upanayana has not been per formed it must be cromated with ordinary fire and water must be offered silently. The same rule applies to a child whose cūčā (tonsure) had been performed before death as stated by Laugāksi. 528i The Vaik, Sm. S. V.11 lays down that there is no burping with fire until the 5th year for a boy and the 7th year for a girl After Upanayana the chuld was to be cremated according to the rites prescribed for an āhitāgoi 80 far as they could be applied (i, e, there would be cremation without sacrificial implements and the mantra &lsquo;asmat tvam abbijātosı&rsquo; was not to be recited) The Baud 529 P. S. (II 3.10-11) provides that tliere is no cremation for children dying before the performauce of carla ( tonsure) and there is no pittimedha for those wlioge upanayana had not been perforined at death or for unmarried girls. It also provides that infants that have struck no teeth are to be buried with syllable &lsquo;om&rsquo; and those that have had teeth with the Vyāhrtis The Mit. on Yaj. III 2 summarises the rules as follows: Before Nāmakarana there was to be only burial and no offering of water and the like; after Nāmakarapa up to the third year cremation and offering of water are optional with burial, from the third year up to upanayana there is cremation and also offering of water but silently (without mantras ), If Oūdā ceremony was performed before the 3rd year and the child died then also the same rule applied. After Upanayana the deceased vas to be cremated with ordinary fire but the procedure was to be the same as for an āhitāgni,</p>

<p>A yati (sannyāsin) was and is even now buried. In a previous note (n, 528b) a verse of Kratu is quoted that a brahmacārin and yati are to be cremated with uttapana fire, The explanation of the Suddhiprakāśa (p. 166 ) is that the word yati here means an ascetic of the Kutīcaka kind and quotes a 530 verse as to how the dead bodies of the yatis of four grades are to be disposed of. The 531 Baud. P. S. IIL11 gives a brief description which is adopted with some variations by the . Smrtyarthasara (p. 98) that contains a description of the death rites of a parivrājaka. 532 One slould go to the east or north of the village, he should dig ā pit (lit, a sacrificial place) as deep as the staff ( carried by the yati) under a palāśa tree or on a river bank or on some other pure spot to the accompaniment of the vyjālirtis; then he should sprinkle water thereon thrice repeating the seven vpāhrtis each time, should spread darbha grass on the bottom of the pit, should deck the dead body (with garlands, sandal paste ), deposit the body in the pit with the mantra (Tai 8.1.1.3.1) &lsquo;O Viṣṇul guard this offering (the dead body ).&rsquo; He should place in the right hand the staff of the parivrājaka (breaking it into three parts ) with the mantra ' Viṣṇu took strides over this&rsquo; (Rg. I.22.17, Vaj. S. V.15, Tai. S. 1.2,13,1). He places the skija (loop of strings ) in the left</p>

The Nidayasindhu (pp 634-635) quotes the Smrtyartha sāra and then adds a few details from Brhat-Saunaka, riz that the dead body of a yatr should be bathed with the Purusasūkta (Rg X, 90), then the pit (dug for burial) should be sprinkled eight times with the syllable &lsquo;Om&rsquo;on all sides; having deposited the body in the pit with the Yajus formula &lsquo;O Viṣṇu i guard this offering.

X. 90). He should fill up the pit thoroughly (with sand) in order to guard against jackals and dogs and the like (exhuming the body with their paws) The Dharmasindhu (p 497) adds some details particularly as to the number of hymns and mantras to be repeated It states that the crown of the head should be pierced with a conch or an axe. that one who is unable to do this gliould smash a ball of jaggery placed on the head. It adds that no yati except kuticaka should be cremated. In modern times a sannyāsin is always buried and not cremated, since kuticaka and babūdaka kinds of pati are no longer in vogue and it is only the paramahamsa that is prevalent in the whole of India. The reason why ascetics were buried and pot cremated</p>

<p>231</p>
<p>Why ascetics were not cremated</p>
<p>appears to me to be as follows; part of the procedure of becoming an ascetic consisted in giving up his srauta fires and throwing in fire his sacrificial wooden implements (vide H. of Dh. vol. II. p. 954). One of the rules for ascetics is that he should not kindle siauta or smārta fires por kindle ordinary fire for cooking his food but was to subsist on cooked food obtained by begging (HI, of Dh. yol I pp. 933-934). The householder was cremated with his srauta or smārta fire but the ascetic, having abjured these, was without any fire and was therefore buried. The Vaikhanasasmārtasūtra X. 8 (ed. by Caland ) contains a brief description of the burial of an ascetic who was not an āhitāgni and the cremation of an ascetic who was āhitāgni,</p>
<p>Special rules were laid down about the cremation of women dying in or immediately after child-birth and women dying while still in their monthly illness. A smrti quoted by the Mit and the Smrti-candrikā (I p. 121) provides that in the case of a sūtehū, one should take water and pancagavya in a jar, should repeat holy texts (such as &ldquo;apo hi sthā&rsquo; Rg. X. 9. 1-9, verses addressed to Varuna) over them, should then bathe the sūtikā with water and pañcagavya and then cremate the body. A woman in her monthly illness was to be similarly bathed and she was to be covered with another garment and then cremated. Vide Garudapurāna I 4. 171 ff and Nirnayasindhu p. 621. Similarly, elaborate rules are pres cribed about the rites of cremation in relation to the death of &amp; pregnant woman (vide Baud P. S. II, 9, Nirnayasindhu p. 622) which are passed over here.</p>

The last may be rendered as follows: O Agnil bring all those piits here in order that they may par take of the offering, those (pitrs whose bodies) were buried or cast aside (exposed) or burnt or deposited above (on troos or in caves ? )s36. In the word &lsquo;anagnidagdhāh&rsquo; occurring in Rs. X. 15. 14, scholars soe a reference to burial. But it is quito possible that no burial is referred to. If some ancestors worc killed far from home in a fight or if they wore kidnapped and killed by enemies, their bodies might havo beon Jeft uncared for in a distant land and not cremated nor buriod. A passage in the Chāndogya 537 Up. (VIII, 8. 5) is construed by some scholars as referring to burials. It may be rendored as followy. Therefore they designate evon now a man, an asura who dong not make gista, who has no faith and who offors no sacrifices; for this is the esoteric doctrino of Asiiras. They dock out the body of the dead with bhihsā (perfumes and forers ?), with s raiment by way of decoration, and think that they will thuis conquer the next world. Though the passage is not quito clear, the reference to Asuras, their usage of docorating the dead body and thereby being able to gain the nort world sonder it probable that the usage of the burial of the body among Asuras is roforred to.

<p>may I not go to the earthen house&rsquo;. This is probably &amp; re ference to buria). Besides, after the charred bones were collec ted, they were placed in an urn or pot, which was buried in the ground and after a good deal of time &amp; mound (śmaśāna) was built upon the bones as will be seen immediately from a passage in the Sat Br, and other sources In A V. XVIII % 25 it is said, &lsquo;may the tree not oppress them, nor the great goddess Earth&rsquo;. This is probably a reference to a coffin and burial.</p>
<p>It is somewhat curious that the progressive nations of the West, believing in a literal interpretation of the Biblical words (such as Matthew 22.23-33, Mark 12. 18-27 and Luke 20. 37-38, John 5. 19-31 and 6. 32-56) about physical resurrection of the dead, held fast by burial alone and up to the end of the 19th century people in Christendom would not allow the cremation of a dead body. The case of Reg. v. Price illustrates how deep the sentiment against cremation was and how popular fury prevented Price from disposing of the body of his dead child of five months by petroleum fire in a field, how he was prosecuted for two offences viz. misdemeanor at Common Law for burning a dead body instead of burying it and misdemeanor on the ground that he attempted to burn the body with intent to prevent an inquest being held on it by the coroner.538 It was only in 1902 that the Cremation Act (% Edw. 7 Ch. 8) was passed empowering burial authorities to establish crematoria on plans approved by the Minister of Health. The Catholic Church does not even now allow cremation. The ancient Romans on the other hand held crepation as the honourable means of the disposal of the dead body but reserved burial for the suicide and the murderer.</p>
<p>Embalming the dead for some time at least was not quite unknown in India. The Sat, Śr, 29. 4, 29 and Vaik. Śr, 31.23 539 prescribe that if an ābitāgni died away from his people his corpse should be laid down in a tub or trough filled with sesaine oil and brought home in a cart. In the Rāmāyapa it is several times said that the body of Dasaratha was placed for several</p>

<p>What the state of things was before the composition of tho Rgveda cannot be said with certainty. There is no general agreement as to the age of the Rgveda and of the ruins found at Mohenjo-daro and Harappa. Sir John Marshall (in Mohonjo daro vol. I. p. 86) refers to complete burials, partial burials and post cremation burials. The excavations at Lauriga sil Nandan garh have brought to light supposed Vedic burial mounds in which has been found a small repousse golden plaque bearing the figure of a nude female, the Earth Goddess These and the disposal of corpses in paleolithic ages are matters for archaoo logists and are outside the proper scope of the present work.</p>

<p>It appears that among early Buddhists in India hardly any religious ceremony was performed, whether the person docoased was a layman or even a member of the Order. In tho Mahāparinibbāna Suttanta the death and the funeral cererronios of the great founder of Buddhism are described in chaptor V ( Section 14 ff). All that is gathered from that chapter is that the favourite disciple of the Buddha, Ananda, uttered a stanza, some of the disciples that were not free from passion wept and fell beadlong on the ground, while others (who wora Arobots) bore the grief with composure, that next morning Ananda went to the Mallas of Kusinārā, that the Mallas took perfumea,</p>

<p>garlands, all musical instruments and five hundred suits of apparel, the Mallas passed seven days in paying bomage to the body of the Buddha that lay in the sala grove with dancing, hymns, music, garlands and perfumes, in making canopies of their garments, that on the 7th day they carried the body of the Blessed One to the south but owing to a miracle (described in sections 29-32) they carried it through the city by the north gate and laid the body to the east (the general rule was that a dead body was not to be carried through the middle of a village, and was to be carried to the south but as Buddha was so extraordinary and holy the above was allowed to be done ). The body of the Buddha was then wrapped in a new cloth, then with cotton wool, then in a new cloth and so on till 500 layers of cloth and cotton wool covered the body The body was then placed in an oil vessel of iron which was covered with another oil vessel of iron, Then a funeral pile of all kinds of perfumes was built upon which the body was placed. Then Mahākassapa and five hundred brethren accompanying him arranged their robes on one ahoulder (representing the way in which the sacred thread is arranged among the brābmapas), bowed down with clasped hands, went round the body reverently thrice, The body was then burnt and only bones remained. Then the narrative states that Ajataśatru, king of Magadha, the Licohavis of Vesāli and several others claimed portions of the relics of the Buddba. Then the relics were divided into eight parts. Those who received them built mounds (Thūpas) over the relics and the Moriyas who got only embers also built a Thūpa over them and a brahmana Dona (Drona) built a mound over the jar (kumbha) in which the bones were collected. Mr. Rhys Davids remarks (8. B. E vol. XI Introduction p. XLV) &lsquo;though funerals are naturally not infrequently mentioned in the historical books and in the Birth stories there is nowhere any reference to a recognised mode of performing any religious worship&rsquo;. It will ba noticed that the Buddhist ritual 512, though simple, agrees closely with some of the rules of Aśv. gr.</p>

<p>let them eat no mineral salt or ordinary $48 salt for three nights, let them optionally avoid for twelve nights the distribution of gifts and the study of vedic texts if one of the principal gurus (father, mother or the teacher who performed upanayana and taught the whole Veda) dies. Pār. gr. IIL 10 adds that they should remain chasto, eat food only once in the day and that they should not repeat Veda study, and should give up the daily obligatory duties except those connected with Vedic fires. Manu (V. 73) adds that they should not eat flesh for three days. Vas. (4.14-15 ) lays down that the relatives who returned from the cemetery should sit down for three days on mats and fast, that if they are unable ( to fast for three days ) they should subsist on food bought in the market or obtained unasked. Ya. III 17 and Pār. III, 10 549 provide that for the night they should put milk and water in an eartben Tessel in the open space (on a szkya) with the words &lsquo;O departed onel bathe here (in the water) and drink this milk&rsquo;. Yāj III, 17, Paithinasi, Manu V. 84, Par. gr. III 10, and others state that the relatives of the departad should perform their own daily rites to be performed in the frauta fires (such as Agaibotra and Darsapūrpamāsa) and in the smārta fire (such as morning and evening homa) on account of the peremptory dictates of the Veda (such as one should perform Agnihotra as long as one lives&rsquo;). The commentators have added several limitations and restri ctions. The Mit.553 on Yā). III, 17 states that, as Manu V, 84 only prohibits the stopping of the rites in (Vedic and Smarta ) fires, such religious duties as the five daily Mahayajñas are excluded, that Vaiśvadeya, though performed in fire, is excluded because there is an express text of Samyarta &amp; brāhmapa should be without Vaiśvadova for ten days ( after the death of a sapinda ), that the Srauta and Smārta rites should be got per formed by another, as Pāraskara (III 10&rsquo;anya etāni kuryuh) expressly lays down Only nziya and narmittaka acts to be parformad in Vedic and Smārta fires are allowed and so Icāmya rites cannot be performed.

<p>perform their srauta nitya homa during days of impurity them selves, though some get it performed by another (Vide Yā). III, 17, Manu V 84). Although there is a text of Gobhilasmrti (III 60 ) prohibiting the performance of sandhya, yet relying on &amp; sūtra of Paithinasi the Mit says that a man can offer water to the Sun in worship; others like the Sertimuktāphala (p. 478) say that sandhyā mantras may be revolved in the mind, except the prāpāyāpia mantras. This is followed in modern times in many parts of India. Viṣṇu Dh, S, 226 prescribas that in impurity due to birth or death homa (Vaiśvadeva ), giving and accepting gifts and the study of Voda ceasa, The Vaiks Sm, S. VL4 states that the perform enga of sandhyā adoration, all rites for the gods and manes, gift and acceptance and Veda study should be given up during impurity on death. Gautama 14,44 appears to hold that a brāhmana is not affected by impurity on birth and death for the purposes of Veda study. On the other hand Samvarta 551 (43) affirms that on the days of impurity on birth and death there is no performance of the five Mahāyajñas nor of Veda study. The Nityācāra-paddhati p 544 states that even in hbauca the thousand names of Viṣṇu may be recited.</p>
<p>Asthisanirayana or Saficayang means that rite in which the (charred) bones (of the cremated person) are collected. This rits is dealt with in many sūtra and smrti works, such as Sān. Sr. IV, 15. 12-18, Sat śr. 28. 3, Āśy.gr. IV, 5 1-18, Gaut P.S I. 5, Viṣṇu Dh, S. 19. 10-1%, Baud P.S I 14, Kausika-sūtra 8%. 29-3%, Vaik. Smārta Sūtra V. 7, Yama 87-88, Saṁvarta 38, Gobbila-smrti II. 54-59 (q. by Hāralatā p. 183). There is great divergence of views about the day on which this was to be done. For example, Sat Sr. 28, 3. 1 provides : 552 &lsquo;bones are collected on the next day after cremation) or on the 3rd, 5th or 7th.&rsquo; Samyarta (verse 38) and Garudapurana (Pratakhanda 5 15 ) prescribe that collection of bones should be made on the 1st, 3rd, 7th or 9th and (particularly) on the 4th by twice-born persons The Vāmanapurana (14 97-98) allows it on the 1st, 4th or 7th day. Yama (87) requires the relatives to collect bones from tho 1st to the 4th day after cremation and also provides (verse 88)</p>

<p>that the four yarpas should respectively perform sañcayana on the 4th, 5th, 7th and 9th day. The Aśv. gp, $. IV. 5. 1 states that saflcayana should be performed after the 10th day from oremation in the dark half, but on uneven tithis (i. e. 1st, 3rd, 11th, 13th, 15th) and on a raksałra which bears a name not applicable to two or more naksatras (i. e. except on the two Aṣāḍhas, two Phalgunis and two Bhādrapadās). Vispu Dh. S. 19 10, Vaik. Sinārta-sūtra V. 7, Kaus. 82. 29, Viṣṇupurāne ILI, 13 14, Kūrmapurīna (uttara) 23 and a few other works lay down that saīcayand must be done on the 4th day after cromation. The various texts differ a good deal in details. The following is the procedure in the Āśv, gr. IV.5.-The bones of a male should be collected into an urn that has no spacial marks (protuberances), those of a woman in an urn that has protuberances but no other special marks, Åged persons,&rdquo; odd in number 553 not being together with women, (i. 8, not as a mixed assemblage ) collect the bones. The per former walks thrice round the spot (where the body was burnt) with his left side turned towards the spot, sprinkles on it with a sami branch milk mixed with water with a verse esitike&rsquo; (Rg. X, 16, 14). With the thumb and the 4th finger they (gatherers ) should put each single bone into the urn without making a ratt}ing noise (of the bones in the urn), the bones of the feet being taken first, those of the head last. Having well gathered the bones and having purified them with a win llowing basket (i. e. Temoving the dust attaching to them) they should put the urn in a pit at a place where the waters from different sides do not flow together except rain water with the verse &lsquo;upasarpa&rsquo; (Rg. X 18, 10) and he should throw earth (into the pit) with the following verse (Rg X. 18. 11) After having thrown (earth) he should repeat the next verse (Rg. X, 18, 12).

I dissent from him for various reasons; the niost important is that if his theory be correct a period of several conturios must be postulated between the two hymns, This is inadmissible.</p>
<p>The Kausikasutra (82, 29-32) prescribes certain details differently. It says that the bones are collected with A. V. 18. 2. 84, 26, then they are consigned to a jar over which alj frag rant powders aro scattorod, then the jar is raised with the Utthāpani yorses and carried with the verses called Haridis (ie, A V. 18 % 11-18). He (the performar) deposits (in the earth the urn) at the root of a troo with the verse &lsquo;mā tva&rsquo; (A. V. 18. 2. 25 May the tree not injure thee all round, may not tho wido goddess Earth also injure theo&rsquo;). 551</p>
<p>The other sūtras present several yariations which are passed over here, excopting one or two matters. The Sat, Sr, proridos that the twig should be of the Udumbara trae, that the bonos aro collected by women of the family of the decaased (his sifo and othora) odd in number (five or more), or other womon (in the absonce of women of the family). A woman who is not likoly to have a child should tie in her left hand a Brhati fruit with two threads, blue and red in colour, should step on a stone with hor left foot, colloct the bones first from the teethiyo or head with the mantra uttistbata&rsquo; (Tai Ā VI. 4. 2) and she should deposit those bones in a jar or garment, then a second woman of the same type collects bones from the shoulders or arms, a third woman from the sides or hips, a fourth from the thighs or legs, and a fifth from the feet They or mora vomon collect the bones completely, The urn is deposited at the root of a sami or palāsa tree,</p>
<p>In modern times, particularly in towns and cities, the collection of bones has to be done immediately after cremation.

Then old men odd in number with the performer collect the bones (as stated by Aśy.gr, above) and place them in a new jar and if they are of a woman in a jar with protu berances They also winnow the ashes with a sūrpa and place in the jar even small bones and throw the ashes into the Ganges. Then at some time other than the rainy season a pit should be dug in a pure spot whereon water would not flow and the performer deposits the jar in the pit with the mantra &lsquo;approach this mother, Earth&rsquo; (Rg. X. 18, 10). With Rg X, 18. 11, he throws earth in the pit all round the jar and muimurs with folded hands the mantra (Rg X, 18, 12 ) and he closes the jar with a new earthen disk with the verse Rg. X. 18. 13 Then he should put earth on the jar in such a way that it may not be seen by anybody and without looking back should go else where and bathe, The Nirnayasindhu (p. 586 ) expressly states that the procedure for the collection of bones may be gathered from one&rsquo;s sūtra or from the work of Bhatta (i. o. Nārāyana, Kamalakara&rsquo;s grandfather).</p>
<p>The Vispudharmagūtra (19.11-12) and Anu, 26.32 state that the collected bones should be cast in Ganges water, since as many particles of the bones of a man remain in Ganges vater for so many thousands of years he dwells in heaven. It was provided in the Purāpas that a virtuous son, brother or daughter&rsquo;s son or a relative on the father&rsquo;s or mother&rsquo;s side should cast the bones in the Ganges, that one not so related should not do it and that if he does it he has to perform cāndrāyapa prāyaścitta. Even in modern times many Hindus take the charred bones of their parents or other dear relatives to the Ganges at Prayaga (Allahabad) or some other holy river 5540 or cast them into the sea. The Nirnayasindhu (p. 587 ) quotes an elaborate rite of casting the ashes in the Ganges from Saunaka. It is briefly as follows: The performer should go out of the village, bathe with clothes on, sprinkle the earth where the ashes are deposited with the Gayatri and the other mantras usually repeated over</p>

Then he should bathe and purify the bonos by touching the bones again and again and repeating the mantras .eto nyindram stavāma suddham &amp;c&rsquo; (Rg VII. 95, 7-9). Then he should bathe with panca. gavya and become pura. Then he should batho ten times with cow&rsquo;s urino, cow&rsquo;s dung, cow&rsquo;s milk, curds, clarified butter, water in which kuśas have been dipped, ashes (of sacred fires), earth, honey and water. Then he should sprinkle (with kuśas) wator on the bones with the mantras, viz. Rg. 1,2% 16. Rg VIII 95,7-9, 555 Rg VII. 56.12-14, Rg. X. 126 1-8, Rg. X. 119,1-13, Rg. IX. 1.1-10 (called Pāvomāni verses ), Rg. X 128,1-4, Rg. I 43.1-9 (a hymn to Rudra); then he should offer &amp; hiranya Srāddha for the deceased, offor pinda to him and perform tarpxina with sesame. Then he should cover the bones in seven ways viz. by doer-skin, woollen blanket, darbhurs, cow&rsquo;s hair, hempen cloth, birch leaf and palm leaf. He should cast among the bones pieces of gold and silver, pearls, coral and sapphire for the purification of the bones, then he should offer into fire 108 oblations of clarified butter and sesame with the hymn beginn ing with &lsquo;udiratām&rsquo; (Rg. X. 15). Then he should cast the bones in holy water; thereby he does not incur the fault of touching an unclear object. While answering the calls of nature or performing acamana one should not hold the bodes,</p>

<p>The Aśv, gr. IV.6, the Sat Sr. 284, Sān Śr 46 (called parıdhikarma) and some others prescribe a sāntı rite after collection of the charred bones of a deceased person. The Baud. P. S. (II. 3 3) and Viṣṇu Dh. S. 19.19 appear to prescribe the Santi rite after the ten days of impurity have expired(&lsquo;dasarātre saucam krbyā sāntih&rsquo;). It is described by Aśv. gr as follows: They who have lost a guru (father or mother) by death should perform on the new moon day an expiatory ceremony. Before sunrise they should carry fire together with its ashes and with its receptacle to the south with the half verse &ldquo;I send away the flesh-devouring Agni&rsquo; (Rtg X 16 9) Having cast that fre down at a place where four roads meet or somewhere else, they</p>

At the time of the Agnihotra (in the afternoon, he should kindla fire (by means of the arabis) with, the half verse &lsquo;Here may this other Jatavedas&rsquo; (Rg X. 16,9 latter half)&rsquo;. Keeping the fire burn ing they sit till night silence falls, repeating tales of old mon (of the family) and stories of auspicious contents, Itzhāsas and Purūnas When all sounds have ceased or when the others (members of the deceased&rsquo;s family) have gone to their houses or Testing place, (the performer) should pour out a continuous stream of pater beginning at the south side of the door with the verge (Rg. X. 53.6) &lsquo;spreading the thread follow the light of the world&rsquo; and go round the house ending at the north side of the door, Thez having placed the fire and spread to the west of it a bull&rsquo;s hide with neck to the east, with the hair outside, he should cause the people of the house (including pomen) to step on that hide with the verse &lsquo;Aribe to long life &lsquo;557 (Rg, X. 18,6). He should place tvigs round the fire with &lsquo;Here do I deposit an encircling thing&rsquo;(Rg. X. 18.4). Having placed a stone to the north of the fire with the words &ldquo;May they place a mountain between themselves and death&rsquo; (Rg. X. 18.4 last pāda) and having sacrificed with four verses &lsquo;Go hence, O Death&rsquo; (Rg. X. 18.1*), he should look at his people with the verse &lsquo;as days follow each other&rsquo; (Rg.

<p>556, Nārāyana explains that the fire means ordinary kitchen fire and be seems to be right in spite of Oldeaberg&rsquo;s pote to the contrary oa p. 246 (of S.

A cow, a cup of metal and a fresh unworn garment are the sacrificial fee for each of the brāhmanas.</p>
<p>A few details may be added from other sūtras. The Sat Śr, (28.4.1) provides that the Sānti is performed on the 10th day after cremation by a priest, that in the folded hands of the wives ( of the members of the family ) he puts the remains of the material used for oblations syith the verge * these women, not being widows' (Rg, X. 18,7=Tai.

Let bim make it in autumn or in Māgha or in summer. The sepulchral mound should be four cornered, because the people who are worshippers of gods (or godly) make their burial mounds four-cornered, while those who are followers of Asuras, the Easterns and such like people, make them round. As to the choosing of the ground, the Sat. Br. states several views viz. he makes it on ground sloping towards the north or, according to some, to the south; but the Sat, Br, disspproves of both the views and prescribes that he should make the burial mound on any level ground where the waters flowing from a southernly direction come to the east and stand still without dashing forward and on such a ground one may make it (burial mound).

Vaj. S. 35. 16 serves 367 as a puronur ākyā (invitatory formula). He then offers with Vāj. S. 35.17. He says this so that Agni may guard and protect these men. The sacrificial fee is an old ox, old barley, old chair with a head cushion, He may give more if he desires. This is the procedure in the case of one who has performed Agnicayana 568 In the case of him who has not performed Agni. cayapa, there is the same procedure for selecting a site and the same performance says that of the firs-altar Having fetched a clod from the boundary he deposits it midway between the sepulchral mound and the village with Vaj. S. 35. 15 (imam 569 Jivebhyah). He then makes this a boundary between the Fathers and the living, so as not to commingle the two.</p>
<p>The Sat. Śr. 29. 13 f, and Baud. P.S. I 17–20 provide a lengthy procedure for erecting a mound over the bones of one who has performed the special rite of agnicajana which is passed over here. In building a mound the urn deposited under - a tree is taken out and after the bones are purified in various Ways (such as the spilling on them of curds mixed with vājina from &amp; jar, the digging up of the clods by means of a plough to which &amp; certain number of oxen are yoked). The Sat. Sr. (29. 1. 3-12) deals with one kind of procedure in which there is no dhavana, while 29.1. 13-32 deal with the procedure where dhamana is employed and sūtras from 33 deal with procedure common to both pahsas (viz, one without dharana and the other with dhawna) The building of a mound with clods (lostaciti) in which there is dhavana is rather an obscure matter in its nature and had some symbolic significance which is now lost. It may be briefly described as follows. The members of the deceased&rsquo;s house</p>

(29.1 5-6) says 572 that the site of the mound / $maśūnāyatana ) is five prahramas on all four sides (or six on the east and five in the other directions, acc. to some ). The height of the mound is variously given ayen in the same sūtra. 573 Sat Śr. states that the height way be two finger-breadths, or three or four or a pradeśa (the distance between the thunib and index finger when both are stretched away) or a vlast, (twelve finger-breadtha), or it may be up to the knee or thighs or buttocks The Baud P S,T, 18 gives different 574 measurements. It states if the mound to be raisad is as high as the neck towards the west, then it is up to the pavel on the east, if it is as high as the naye) on the west, then it is as high as the knee on the east; if up to the knee on the west them on the east it is level with the ankle&rsquo;.

<li>Stages in the disposal of dead bodies</li>
</ol>
<p>modern times. In the Baud. 578 P. S. I 17 there are passages that bear &amp; close resemblance to sonze passages of the Sat. Sr on dhavana. Similarly, Kāt Sr. 579 21. 3,6 provides (immedi ately after the months in which mounds were to be constructed) that as many jars should be taken as there are persons perfoıın ing dhavana (or dhurana) and the conimentator explains that word as meaning &lsquo;fanning&rsquo;.</p>
<p>It will be seen that the disposal of the dead in ancient India was divided into four stages viz. cremation, collecting the charred bones and depositing them underground in an urn, expiatory rites (called Santıkarma) and erection of a monument over the bones. The last was not necessarily done in every case. The Andhau Juscription of the time of Rudradaman in the year 52 (probably of the saka era ) refers to the erection of a staff (lasti i e, yasti) as a funeral monument to the inemory of a sister, brother and vife by Madana son of Sibila (vide E I VOI, 16 pp. 23-25). In a long passage of the Brahma purāna quoted by Aparārka (pp. 887-886) it is stated that the charred bones of a cremated person should be collected in an urn and deposited at the root of a tree or cast in the Ganges, that the place of cremation should be purified with cowdung and kator, that a puskaraka tree should be planted there or an eduka (a structure ) should be built over it. 580</p>
<p>The Sat Śr 28.4 28 and Baud P S. II. 3. 2 state as shown above thet the rites immediately after death were performed only up to the depositing of the urn (containing the bones) underground in the case of those housobolders who had not set up tbe vedio fires and in the case of married women and that in the case of him who had performed the solemn rite of Agni cayang &amp; mpound with bricks or clods was built up on the bones.</p>

<p>It is remarkable that while slaves and even attendants Fere often buried with the aiaster in Babylon and Celtic Britain, there is no similar reference to the burial or cremation of anybody with the deceased even in the ancient procedure found in the Sat Br It is only possible to say that in some cases in the pre-Vedic age the wife might have burnt herself along with the deceased husband on the funeral pyre. There is no doubt that later works like the Viṣṇuidharmasutra recommended to women the practice of Satī as an option to leading the life of perfect celibacy after the husband&rsquo;s death,</p>
<p>The persons entitled to perform the funeral rites after death (antyakarmadhikarin) are the same as those entitled to offer sraddha. There is a good dea] of difference as to the order of the persons so entitled For example, Gautama (Dh. S 15 13-14) statos &lsquo;On failure of sons the sapındas (e g. brother, brother&rsquo;s 5012 ), the sapindas of the mother (eg maternal uncle or his con) and pupils may perform srāddha for the deceased; id default of these the family priest and the ācārya (veda teacher).&rsquo; Saṅkha says 582 &ldquo;The offering of pinda and water should be done by the son for the father; in default (i e absence or death) of the son, the wife of the deceased) should offer, but in default of her the full brotber&rsquo; The Viṣṇupurāna 532 provides</p>
<p>the son, grand-son, great grandson (of the deceased), the offspring of the brother (of the deceased), the offspring of a sapinda become entitled to offer (pioda)&rsquo; The Mārkandeya purāda provides (30. 19-21, chap 27.19-23 of the Veuk, ed.) &lsquo;On failure of the sons, sapindas, on failure of them the samānoda kas, then the sapindas of the mother, and samāpodakas of her, should perform these rites, a daughter&rsquo;s son should perform them (If the man dies sonless), the putrikāputra should perform them for bis maternal grand-Father: in default of all these, womeil should perform these rites for their husbands but without Vedic mantras; in default of wife the king should get the rites per formed by some one belonging to the fainily (of the deceased)</p>

<p>OT by persons of his caste, since the king is the relative of all yarnas 583 There was a close connection between taking the estate of a man and performing the rites after death up to the 10th day. For the doctrines represented by the Mitaksarā and the Dāyabhāga, vide H. of Dh. yol II pp. 734-743. Even those that regarded that inheri tance was based on relationship by blood and not on the capacity to offer pindas held that it was obligatory on everyone who took the estate of another (including the king who took as the ultimate heir by escheat) to arrange for the rites after death and śrāddha. Vispu 584 Dh. S. XV. 40 declares &lsquo;Whoever inherits the estate of a deceased person has to offer pinda to him.&rsquo; Yāj. II 127 says the same thing about the Kse raja son (ubhayorapyasau rikthi pinda-dātā ca dharmataḥ).</p>
<p>· The Smrtyarthasāra (p. 94 ) states the order of adhikarins as fullors; a competent son is the first adhikāri for offering pinda; in default of a son, husband, wife and co-vives; in default of these, the brother&rsquo;s son, the brother, daughter-in-law, daughter, daughter&rsquo;s son, any other sagotra, &amp; sapinda, a fellow-student, a friend, a pupil, the teacher, any relative and anyone who takes the wealth of the deceased may offer pında, The father is not competent to perform śrāddha rites for his (deceased) son, an elder brother for his younger brother; these may even do so through affection but they cannot perform the sapindīkarana, Parents may offer pinda to unmarried daugh ters, and even to married daughters in the absence of another (proper) giver. The daughter&rsquo;s son and the maternal grand father may offer to each other; the daughter&rsquo;s son to waterna) grand-mother; the son-in-law and father-in-law to each other, the daughter-in-law to her mother-in-law, brothers among them selves, teacher and pupil to each other.

IL 128-132) and the order of śrāddbadhikārins is given by it as follows: aurasa son, then grandson, then great grandson, then adopted son If there are many sons then the eldest alone is the adhikarin; if the eldest be pot present or is patrta, then the son next to the eldest is the adbikarin (and not the youngest). If the sons are divided from each other, then all the rites up to sapindikarana are to bo performed by the eldest alone who may make the other sons contribute to the expenses, but the yearly śrāddha may ba per formed by each son separately. If the sons (of the deceased) are not divided, then all rites including the yearly śrāddha also are to be performed by the eldest alone When the eldest son not being present, the younger one or the youngest per forms the cremation, he should perform all rites up to and inclu ding the sixteen śrāddhas, but not sapiodikarada and he should wait for one year for the arrival of the eldest If the eldest comes to know of the death within one year, he alone should perform the sapindīkarada, If the eldest son does not come even at the end of one year, then even the youngest may per form sapindīkarana. If before the expiry of one year the youngest son or some one other than &amp; son performs the moothly, anumāsika, sapindikarana śrāddhas, then the eldest son or a son should again perform these. If there is a grandson who has his upadayana performed and there be a son those upanayana is not performed it is the latter who is a preferable adhikarin, provided he is either three years old or has the cūdā ceremony performed as stated by Sumantu 586 Manu IL 172 states that a boy should not repeat the Veda before the performance of Upanayana except the mantras that are te quired for the śrāddha of his deceased father or mother.

<p>&lsquo;sama way he should make only the declaration (saṅkalpa) of darsaśrāddha and mahālaya and the rest may be performed by sonis one else. An adopted son becomes an adhıkārin for fune Tal rites and the like only if the upanayana has been performed. If there be no lineal descendant up to a great-grandson and also no adopted son, then the wife should perform with mantras the funeral rites and yearly and other śrāddbas but if she is unable to repeat the Vedic mantras, then the same rules apply as in the case of an anupanīta son. Even if the husband be not divided from his brother, or be be re-united with his brother, it is the wife and not the brother who is to be preferred as having adhikara for śrāddha, though the brother gets all the property. Though some of the latest works on dharmaśāstra like the Nirnayasindhu 587 and Dharmasındhu (bhāryayapi samantrakam-eya-aurdhradehikadikam kāryam) allowed the wife to perform rites after death with vedic mantras, several works such as the Mārkandeya-purāna and the Brahmapurada did not allow the wife to repeat Vedic mantras (vide note 583 above). In default of the wife, the daughter has the right to perform rites after death if the deceased was separated and not re-united. But if the deceased was joint then his full brother would be the proper adhikarin after the wife. Among daughters the married one is preferred, though an unmarrjed daughter is a preferable heir. In default of daughters, the daughter&rsquo;s son is an adhikarin; then a brother, then a brcther&rsquo;s son. Among brothers a full brother is preferred to a half brother and if there be both elder and younger brothers, then the younger is preferred for performing rites after death (in order to make as near an approach as possible to the relation of father and son). If there be no younger brother, then even an elder one could be adhikārin; in default of full brother, a half brother. Some held that even if the deceased was separata from his brother and had a daughter or daughter&rsquo;s son as heir the funeral rites were to be performed by the brother (and not by the daughter or her son), since &amp; sagotra is to be preferred as an adhikarin to one of a different gotra.

If there be many sister&rsquo;s sons, the rules as to brothers would apply. Then come paternal uncle, his son, other sapindas; 588 then samānodakas, then other persons born in the same family. In default of these, the sapipdas of the mother, such as the maternal grand-father, maternal uncle, maternal uncle&rsquo;s son is that order; in default of the sapindag of the mother, the sons of the deceased&rsquo;s paternal or maternal aunt; in default of these the prir-bandhus such as the sons of the father&rsquo;s father&rsquo;s sister, of the father&rsquo;s mother&rsquo;s sister, of father&rsquo;s maternal uncle; then the maātr-bandhus such as mother&rsquo;s father&rsquo;s sisters&rsquo;s son; in default of these, a disciple (of the deceased); in default of disciple, son-in-law of the deceased (or the father in-law of the deceased); in default of these, a friend; in default, any one who takes the wealth of a brābmana (deceased); if the deceased was other than a brābmana the king (who took the wealth of everyone dying heirless, except the wealth of a brahmana) who arranges for funeral rites through another.</p>
<p>In the case of women the following order of those entitled to perform rites of a deceased woman is given in the Dharma sindhu (p. 370); If the female be unmarried then her father is the adhikarin, then her brother and the like; if the woman was married, her son, then her co-wife&rsquo;s son, then co-wife&rsquo;s grandson and then great-grandson; in default of these, the husband; in default of husband, daughter, then daughter&rsquo;s son; then busband&rsquo;s brother; then husband&rsquo;s brother&rsquo;s son; then daughter-in-last; then (the deceased) woman&rsquo;s father, then her brother; then her brother&rsquo;s son and the rest.</p>
<p>An adopted son should perform the śrāddha of his natural father if the latter left zo son or other adbikārl If a brahms cārin dies, his monthly, yearly and other sraddhas should be performed by his father and mother.

If a brahmacārin performed all the rites for ten days he had to observe āśauca for ten days, but if he performed only the cremation he had to observe āśauca only for one day. Even while in mourning his obligatory acts do not stop; but he should not eat the food cooked for bis relatives that are in mourning nor should be dwell among them; if he did (both these ) he had to undergo prāyaścitta and perform upanayana again,</p>
<p>It is somewhat curious that Baudhāyana, the Lingapurada (quoted in Srāddhaprakāśa pp. 361-371), the Markandeya. purāna, the Pitrdayitā (p 82) and several other works allow man himself while living to perform his own rites after death (antyesti).589 This will be dealt with briefly later on under śrāddha Further, if a man became patrta and refused to undergo prāyaścitta, he was driven out of the Hindu fold by the pro cedure of ghatasphota (vide H. of Dh. Vol. II pp. 387-388), and Gaut. Dh, S. 20 % and Manu XI. 182-183 provide that such a man was to be held to be dead and his relatives were to perform a]l rites for him such as offering water and srāddha and were also to obserye āśauca for him.590</p>
<p>Many commentators and digests quote certain verses of the Vispupurāpa (III, 13. 34-39) wherein the rites (kriyah) after death performed for a person are enumerated as falling into three classes, viz. pūrva, madhyama and uttara. The rites from cremation up to the end of the 12th day are called pūrya, the śrāddhas performed monthly and sapindikarana and ekoddista are called madhyama rites and those that are performed after sapindīkarada, when the deceased has reached the position of pity after being a preta, are designated uttara,591 The pūrva and</p>

<p>[Vol. madhyama rites of the deceased may be performed by the father, the mother, sapindas, samānodakas and those belonging to the deceased&rsquo;s group (gotra) or by the king if le takes the wealth of the deceased. But the rites called uttara are to be performed only by the son, grandson, great-grandson, daughter&rsquo;s son or the latter&rsquo;s sons Even in the case of women, on the day of the anniversary of death every year an ekoddista srāddha may be performed for them. There is also another classification of śrāddhas viz. Navaśrāddha (those rites up to ten days after death), Navamiśra (those performed after ten days up to six seasons), Purana (those perfornied after a year ).591a</p>
<p>As stated above, for ten days after death a bandful of water mixed with sesame was to be offered to the deceased on a stone (aśman) placed on kuśa grass and one large pinda (called pūraka-pipda) was to be offered on busa grags everyday with the face to the south and the sacred thread on the right shoulder (prācidāpiti) for the purpose of freeing tho departed from the state of being a preta. On the pinda, yator mixed with sesame was to be offered and leaves of Bhragarāja (called mākā in Marathi) and Tulasi also. The verse &lsquo;anādi. nidhano&rsquo; was to be repeated 592. The performer throws the pinda in water and then bathes. Vide A.K. D pp. 43-50 and Antyesti-paddhati of Nārāyana for detailed treatment of the procedure of these ten days. Besides this, the Asvalayana grhyaparisistass IIL 6 speaks of five sraddhas called &lsquo;nava</p>

<p>Navaśraddhas</p>
<p>263</p>
<p>śraddhas&rsquo; (or Visamaśrāddhas) performed on the uneven days (i. e. 1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th and 9th ) with uncooked food. According to the Garudapurada (Pretakhanda 34, 36 which speaks of six śrāddhas on uneven days from 1st day to 11th) and Apastamba they are six (Dharmasindhu p 464, Nirdayasindhu p 588, Suddhiprakāśa pp. 214-216, Srāddhatattva p. 619) and accord ing to others there is an option. Angiras and Vasistha speak of six Navasrāddhas on uneven days from the 1st to the 11th, while Baud Pitrmedha S. IL 10, 6 speaks of five. Some prescribe the placing of some cooked food sprinkled with ghee on the hand of a brāhmana. Others do not approve of this They prescribe the placing of uncooked corn in front of a brāk mapa or in front of a figure of a brābmaṇa made with kuśas (called cata in Marathi). The Garudapurāpa (IL. 5, 67 ff) holds that the payasrāddhas are those performed at the place where</p>
<p>man died, where the funeral procession rested on the way, when the bones were collected and those performed on the 5th, 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th and 11th day, The Suddhiprakās3 p. 214 quotes similar views from Katyāyana and the view of Viddha-Vasistha that the deceased does not become free from the status of a preta, unless the navafrāddhas are performed. The Garudapurāna, Pretakhanda (chap. 34. 27-28, 44, 48) states that by the pindas offered for ten days the several limbs of a subtlo body are provided for the departed spirit which at first wanders like thin air. There are several differing views on tho napaśrāddbas which are passed over here. On the uneven days if navaśrāddha is performed two pindas will be offered (one the daily one and the other, of the Dayaśrāddha). The Padma (Srstikhanda 10. 19) prescribes that one should not pat take of the food at navasraddha and on doing so should undergo the cāndrāyada expiation.</p>
<p>In modern times, after the rites of the first day of crema tion and of the collection of the bones, the rites for the dead generally begin on the 10th day. The performer goes to the place where the rites of the first day were performed, makes a saṅkalpa and offers a pinda with the words &ldquo;May this pinda wait upon the preta Damed N. N, and of the gotra (Kāśyapa &amp;o ) in order that hunger and thirst affecting the preta may be removed&rsquo;. Theo he offers water mixed with sesame, places leares of blrngarāja and tulasī, repeats the verge &lsquo;anādini dbano&rsquo; (nota 592), removes the pinda to another place from the place where it was offered. Then he prepares &amp; Led: with</p>

Then he offers a request to the middle jar with the words &lsquo;May this pinda together with the jar of water wait upon the preta by name N, N, of such and such a gotra in order that his hunger and thirst may be allayed&rsquo;. There is a prayer before the jars to the east, south, west and north respectively to those whom the preta had befriended, to Yama, to crows, to Rudra raspectively. There is a difference of view here, some pres. cribing four jars, soma three, while others offer a pipda with the jar of water only on the place meant for the preta and mera pinda to others Then water is offered over the pinda and to each of the above he offers sandals, umbrella, banner, bread. Then the performer waits till a crow seizes or eats the pipda placed to the west 594, Then the aśman (stone) is anointed with oil and cast in water. Then the performer requests the relatives, who offer one handfu) or three handfuls of water to the preta on the bank of the reservoir of water. Then the sons and others accor ding to usage cut their hair and nails. Then all persons of the same gotra, according to the custom of the country, bathe with sesame and myrobalan, wear pure and dried garments, go home and take their meals there.</p>
<p>594 In modern times great importance is attached by many people to a cron todching and pecking at the puda food There is a common belief that if a crow does not touch the pioda then the deceased bad some intense wish at his death that was unfulfilled and it is certainly beart-read ing and a source of poignant sorrow even for passers-by to see the relatives waitiog for hours and tempting the crow or crows to come dove from trees with dainty pieces of copra and other things and also loudly declaring that they would do this or that and fall the last desire of the deceased Often it 50 happeos that no crow touches the pinda food in honour of the deceased, a very old and venerable man, and relatives are very much distressed to fiod that their venerable ancestor who could have hardly any ambition or desire at the advanced age of 50 or 30 (except to die speedily), judging from the reluctance of the crow, had some udfolflied desire, Often the crow immediately touches the piada offered to one who died very young (say 25 or 30 years old) and wbo would naturally be presened to have many unfulfilled desires In such cases the relatives feel very much relieved at the thought that their young relative passed away without any uplalalled desires The Saddbakaumudi refers to this offering to crows as a usage सथाचारात् काकालिदानम् । पिण्डशेपमनं पात्र छन्ना अमुफगोत्रस्य प्रेतस्यामनशमणों विशेपत्तये पमहारापस्थितवायसाय एप बलिन म इत्युत्तुज्य कृतासलि-काक व यमहतोसि रहाण पलिमुत्तमम् । यमलोकगतं प्रेत बमाप्पायितुमर्हसि ॥ कामाय कासपुरुपाय वायसाय महात्मने । तुम्य भलिं प्रयच्छामि प्रेतस्य दृषिहेतवे ।। इति पठेत् । शुद्धिकौमुदी p. 135.</p>

<p>Ethereal body after death</p>
<p>265</p>
<p>Some of the Puranas and medieval digests assert that after a man dies, the soul or spirit assumes that is called an ativahika sin body consisting of three of the five elements (vir. fire, vind and akāśa) that rise up from the dead body (while two viz, earth and water remain below), that such a body is obtained only by men and not by other beings, that with the aid of the pindas that are offered to the departed at the time of cremation and during ten days thereafter, the soul secures another body called bhogadeha (a body for enjoying the pindas offered) and that at the end of a year when sapındıkarana is performed, the soul securos a third body wherewith the spirit reaches heaven or bell according to the nature of his actions, The word &lsquo;ativāhika&rsquo; is comparatively an ancient one. It occurs in Vedantasutra IV. 3.4 (ativahikas-tal-lingat). But there the meaning is somewhat different. The Upanisads speak of the soul as going by the path of arcas, day &amp;c. The sutra says that these (viz. ar cis, ahah &amp;c.) are superintending deities that take the soul gradually opward by the path that leads to Brahma. Govindānanda in his commentary on the Prāgaścitta viveka (pp. 13-14) holds that there are only two bodies (and not three as appears at first sight), viz, the ātrvāhika or pretadeha and the blogadeha. The belief was that the man on whose death Do pioda was offered or the sixteen śrāddhas (to be described below) vere not performed remained for all time in the condi</p>

<p>(VOL. tion of a pisaca, from which he would not be freed upon if numerous other śrāddhas were later on offered for him, 595 The Brahmapurāna calls the body &lsquo;yātaniya&rsquo;(i.e, one that has to undergo trials and torments), while the Agnipurāpa calls it</p>
<p>yātāniya&rsquo; or &lsquo;ativāhika&rsquo; and asserts that this body is made up of the elements of ākāśa, vāyu and tegas The Padmapurāna (IL 67, 98 ) states that persons who commit certain sins secure after death a body similar in shape to the physical body for undergoing torments. The underlying conception was that when the gross body was destroyed after death by cremation, burial or other methods an intermediate subtile body had to be built up before the departed soul was compelled to assume another body in a fresh incarnation The subtile body was gradu ally built up, as stated by the Mārk 10.73, by the rites performed on death and on several days after death. Though this con ception is very clearly set forth in the Purāṇas it should not be supposed that it was altogether a new one. It had its roots deep down in the earliest Vedic period and was implioit in some of the hymns as indicated by Rg. X, 15. 14, X. 16, 4-5 translated above. Though in the Tai. S. I 8.5 1-2 and in passages of the Tai, Br, and Sat. Br to be set out later on it is said that the offerings are made to the paternal ancestors, it does not follow that the brāhmanas were not fed at the same time on the food prepared for being offered to the ancestors, just as in the solemn Vedic sacrifices offerings were made to the gods, Agni, Indra, Prajāpati, Visou and others and at the same time priests engaged in the sacrifices were fed and given presents ( dalsına). Therefore, it need not be necessarily sup posed that feeding the brahmanas at sraddha vas &amp; later idea and offering food to the dead was the origina] idea.</p>
