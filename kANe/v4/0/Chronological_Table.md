CHRONOLOGICAL TABLE 

OF some important Sanskrit works and authors referred 

to in volume IV 

lars have 15 date as 400 this question in hi 

N. B.-Some dates, particularly of ancient works, are conjectural and disputed by several scholars. Most of the dates about authors from the 8th or 9th century refer to the probable periods of their literary activity except in the case of a few authors such as Saṅkarācārya and Vidyāpati. 4000 B, C.-1000 B. C-The period of the Vedic Sambitās, 

Brābmanas and Upanisads. Some hymns of the Rgveda, of the Atharvaveda, and in the Taittırīya Sambitā and Brāhmana may possibly go back to a period earlier than 4000 B. C. and some of the Upanisads (even from among those that are regarded by most scholars as the earliest ones) may be later than 1000 B. C. Some scholars have criticized me for ascribióg the vedic sambitās to such an early date as 4000 B. C. Time and health permitting, I may have to deal with this question in a separate vork after I finish the 5th and last volume op which I am now 

engaged. 800 B. C.-500 B. C.-The Nırakta of Yāska 800 B C.-400 B. C.—The principal srautasūtras (of Āpastamba,
