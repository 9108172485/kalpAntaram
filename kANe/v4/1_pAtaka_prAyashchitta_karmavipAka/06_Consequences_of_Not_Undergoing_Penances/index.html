<p>bhramsa-kara actions, sankarikarana, apatrikarana, malini karana and miscellaneous sins, respectively enter the bodies of all plants, of worms (or insects), of birds, of aquatic animals, of animals roving in waters, of deer, of cattle, of untouchables among men, of miscellaneous and cruel carnivorous animais (like tigers). Visou Dh. S. 45.1 provides 358 that sinners, after having undergone the horrors of hells and after having passed through the bodies of lower animals, are born as human beings with certain marks (indicative of their sins) So the teaching of these and other authorities comes to this that sins when not expiated by penances or by State punishment, lead to hell, that then, owing to some remnants of the evil deeds, to birth as lorer animals and then as decrepit or diseased human beings.</p>
<p>It 18 now necessary at this stage to enter upon a historical though brief account of the idea of Hell and of its opposite Heaven 359 There are in the Roveda hardly any clear or express references to Hell In Rg II. 29,6 the sage prays to the Vissa Davas &lsquo;save me from the pit, from falling down into it&rsquo; (trādhram kartād-avapado yajatrāh), In Rg IV 5 5 16 is said 360 that those men who are bereft of tta and satya, being sinful, create deep place for themselves. In Rg. VII 104.3 the poet calls upon Indra and Soma to strike down 361 into bottomless darkness evil-doers, and in VII 104,11 the poet prays that whatever enemy desires to harm the poet by day or night may be deprived of his body and progeny and may be hurled below the tbreg earths Indra is implored in Rg X. 152.4 by the sage to send down into darkness whoever attacks him and his people. In Rs. IX, 73 8 Soma is said to throw dosyn in a pit those who do not observe Soma&rsquo;s ordinances and who are disliked by hiin. Irom these passages what emerges is that the sages of the RgTBON had some faint glimmerings of (or belief in) the idea of a dark</p>

<p>Idea of Hell in Vedic Literature deep pit bolow the earth to which wicked persons were relegated by the gods But there is no mention in the Rgveda of the tortures of Hell. It is in the Atharvaveda that we find the clearest references to Hell (Naraka). Sorcerers and demons dwell in a house below (the eartb), according to A, V.II, 14, 3. Atharva Feda V.30 11 asks a man to come out from death, from the deep and black darkness. In Atharvayeda 362 V. 19. 3 it is asserted that those who spat in the face of a brābmana or who imposed a levy of money on him remain biting hair in the midst of a river of blood Atharvaveda XU. 4. 36 mentions &ldquo;Nāraka-loka'. In the Vāj. S, XXX, 5 the Vialan 363 (i, e, one who gives up or extinguishes the consecrated Vedic fires) is relegated to nāraha (nārakāya virabapam). A vir alan may also mean &lsquo;one who kills a valiant man&rsquo; but that does not seem to be a proper sepse in this passage of the Vaj S. In the Sat, Br. XI. 6, 1 4 we fud a reference to torments of Hell, viz. men cutting up the limbs of others one by one for crimes committed The Tai. À I. 19 speaks of four narakas called Visarpin, Avisarpin, Visādin and Avisādin in the south-east, south-west, north west and north-east, Trom the Kathopanisad it appears that at that time there was a belief that those foolisi men who do not know the Reality and who only believe in the existence of the mundane world alone have to be born again and again and fall into the hands of Yama 364 (II. 5-6) The same Upanisad (V. 7) states that aiter the death (of the body) somo enter the womb in accordance with their actions and knowledge to have an embodied existence, while others go into fixed matter (the form of trees and the like). But that Upanisad says nothing about the torments of Hell. They were therefore probably not believed to exist in those days, at least, to the sapie degree as in the days of the Epics and Purības. The very words at the beginning of the Katha Up, (I. 21 &lsquo;devair-atrāpi vicikitsitau&rsquo;) indicate that there were even then various views about the fate of the departed The Kausitaki Br (XI 3) propounds the remarkable proposition that</p>

IX. 113 10–11 ).367 In Rg IX, 113 8 the poet prays &lsquo;make me immortal (in heaven) where dwells king Vaivasvata, where the sun is confined (i e. where it never sets) and where the divine waters flow&rsquo; A. person who neither offers sacrifices to gods, nor worships, and observes ordinances other than those of Indra is thrown down from Heaven 36 A sage exultingly addresses Soma &lsquo;we have drunk soma, we have become immor tal, we have reached Light (Heaven) and we have known the gods; what will an enemy or harnıful person do to us who have been mortals so far?&rsquo; 369 The pious dead become united in Heaven with their Istāpūs ta (merit due to sacrifices and chari table acts) and with their fore-fathers and become ondowed with a refulgent body (Rg X 148). Those who practise tapas or those who perform sacrifices in which the fees run to thousands (of cows) reach Heaven (Rg x 154.1-3)3, and Soma, ghee and honey flow for them there. Heaven is said to be the abode of Yama and there resounds the sound of flutes and of songs 371 The Atharvaveda, being more popular in</p>

<p>Idea of Heaven in the Veda character, contains much more information about Hoaven. In Atharvayeda III, 29,3 it is said that a donor goes to Heaven where a weak man has not to render to the strong any contri bution 312 In Atharvaveda IV. 34.2, 5-6 it is stated that in the heavenly world there are bovies of women (for the denizens), that there the dwellers get many edible plants and flowers and that there are ponds of gliee, streams of milk and honny, vina</p>

Atharvaveda VI. 1.20.3 and other verses ex press a yearning to meet one&rsquo;s parents, wife and sons (vide Atharva XIL 3,17).374 The Tai. S. is full of references to Heaven and so no quotation is cited bere except one where it is said that he who offers the Adābhya cup in Jyotistoma goes to heaven while still living in this world.375 The Tai, Br. appears to hold that those who offer sacrifices bacome shining stars in the firmament (I. 5. 2. 5–6)375a The Sat. Br. (XI 1. 8.6) states that sacrificer who offers a sacrifice as this redemption is born in the next world (Heaven) with his body entire &lsquo;. 375 Survival of the soul after death is emphatically asserted in the Tai. Br, III. 10. 11. These passages are enough to establish that the state of the pious after death and of heroes killed in battle was one of happiness in heaven, that there the food and material things (such as honey, ghee) that a person required in this world were also available in greater perfection and abun dance The remark of Macdonell &lsquo;Heaven is a glorified world of material joys as pictured by the imagination not of warriors but of priests (Vedic Mythology p. 168) is not (in view of Rg.

<p>that the warriors of Vedic times did not believe what the priests believed. Iu later tiines (as in the Bhagavadgitā II 37 &lsquo;hato vā prāpsyasi svargam&rsquo; or in the Ragluvamśa VII. 51 ) warriors killed in battle were supposed to go to heaven and were privi leged to have the company of beautiful damsels Heaven as a place or state of eternal bliss to which the spirits of the reli gious or meritorious people or warriors go, is an idea common to most ancient peoples and was probably based on the idea that the Earth was flat and the sky was a dome carrying various celestial objects In the Brhadaranyaka Up (IV 3 33) and Tai Up. (II, 8) it is 377 stated that the joys of the world of gods are lundreds of times more delightful than those of the morta] world 378 In the Kathopanisad (I 12 ) it is stated by Yama hin self that in Heaven there is no sear and no old age, that the denizen of Heaven is beyond hunger, thirst and sorrow and is in the midst of all delights. The Kausītakı Br Up as quoted by Saṅkarācārya on Vedāntasūtra 1128 contains the statement that the abode of sinners is below this world or 379 the earth. The Cliāndogya Up in one place remarks380 &lsquo;those whose con duct has been good will quickly attain some good birth, the birth of a brāhunapa or a ksatriya or vaiśya But those whose conduct has been evil will quickly attain an evil birth, the birth of a dog or a log or a candāla&rsquo;.</p>
<p>We have here a complicated blending of two theories The original theory of early Vedic times was that of Heaven and Hell which is also that of most religions Later on when the docti i nes of harma and punar Janma came to be universally believed in India the theory of Heaven and Hell came to be modified by holding that the pleasures of heaven and the torments of Hell both came to an end some time or other and the author of sins was born again as an animal or a tree or a human being suffer ing from diseases and defects</p>

<p>159 Yama in the Veda The fate of the departed soul after the death of the body will be touched upon in the section on Antyesti and Sraddha, but in connection with the doctrine of Hell it is necessary to say something about Yama. In Rg. X. 58, 1 Yama is called Vaivasvata (son of Vivasvat, the Sun). Yama is at least an Indo-Iranian deity. Yama is eulogised in Rg. X. 14. He is</p>
<p>of gathering called a king and is credited with the task together people (X. 14. 1); le is said to have been the first to make a way to Heaven) which was followed by former ancestors of mankind (X 14,2 &lsquo;Yamo no gātum prathamo viveda. yatra nah pūrve pitarah parayuh &lsquo;). The soul when departing from this world is told that when he follows the paths of the ancient ancestors he would see the two kings Yama and Varupa. In Rg. X. 14. 13-15 the priests are asked to press Soma for Yama, to offer oblations to him and it is said that yaiña reaches Yama, Agni being the messenger. In Rg. X. 135. 1 Yama is stated to drink in the company of gods, he is the lord of men. Yama owns two dogs each having four eyes who guard the way, who are the spies of Yama and who move among men and mark their doings. In Rg. X. 97. 16 the sage prays &lsquo;May the plants release me from the effects of the) violation of oaths, from the violation of the ordinances of Varupa, from the fetters which Yama claps on the feet of sinners and from all sins against the gods &ldquo;331 In Rg. X. 165. 4 Yama is identified with Mrtyu (death) and the owl (an evil omen) or a kapota is said to be the dita (harbinger) of Yana Rg 1. 38 5 (addressed to the Maruts) appears to crave for something which is opposed to that other references to Yama state &lsquo;May not the singer of your praises go by the path of Yama&quot;382 Thus, though in the Rgveda, Yama is a god and mostly a beneficent ruler of men, there is an element of fear associated with him as the two prying dogs that guard the way to heaven and his being called Mrtyu would suggest. The Atharvaveda refers to Yama in several places in the same strain as in the Rg. In A, V 18 3 13 it is said 393 &lsquo;serve the king Yama with offering, who was the first to die among men, who was the first to depart from this world and who, the son of Vivasyat, is the gatherer of men&rsquo;, In Tai S.

<p>IV Heaven and Hell in post-Vedic Literature 161</p>
<p>We must now turn to the ideas of Heaven and Hell contained in the post-Vedic Literature, sūtras, smrtis, puradas and digests. The Nir. (I 11 ) quotes387 a quarter of &amp; Vedic verse which means &lsquo;for fear that if we (women) acted crookedly towards our husbands ) we might fall into Hell&rsquo; The word Naraka is derived by it in two ways (172 to araka), viz. as meaning &lsquo;going below&rsquo; (the earth) or (na to ra t-ka) where there is not the slightest place for joy&rsquo;. In another place, while deriving the word &lsquo;putra&rsquo; (son) the Nir. (IL 11) declares that the son is called putra because he saves (the father) from the hell called put. The same derivation of the word putra is offered by Manu IX 138 (=Adiparva 229.14 Visnudharmasūtra 15.44). Gautama (13,7) promises 388 heaven to the witnesses in a cause if they speak the truth, but Hell (naraka) if they tell the opposite (of truth). After defining patana as loss of the capacity to perform the privileged acts of twicz-bors classes (such as Veda study &amp;c) and stating that by being guilty of sios a man does not in the next world reap the fruits of his good actions, Gautama states the striking viey of other sages that naraka is nothing more than this loss of capacity and of the fruits of good acts, his own view how ever being that naraka is a particular place where a man has to dwell solely in distress and sorrow. It was the enphatic view of Gautama that men of the several varnas and aśramas that ara devoted to the actions prescribed as peculiar to each, enjoy after departing from this body, the fruits of their actions and then oving to some remainder of their total actions are born in bodies in appropriate circumstancas as to the country, caste, family, appearance, length of life, learning, conduct, wealth, happiness and intelligence, while those who act contrariwise</p>

Dh S, affirms that Naraka is indeed one&rsquo;s lot when one trans gresses one&rsquo;s dharma. It also states that rewards without end are denominated svai gya. The Vedāntasūtra II 1.13 makos it 391 clear that after enjoying the fruits of one&rsquo;s actions in the abode of Yama (Samyamana) ovil-doers ascend to this mortal world. In Vedāntasūtra III. 1.15 the narakas 392 are said to be seven Panini VL 238 teaches the accent of mahāraurava. In the Kāśikā com on Panini IL 2.88 a vedic verse is oited accor ding to which one who kills his mother enters the 7th na aka. The Vignupurāna I, 6.41 names seven hells, Tāmisra, Andhatā misra, Mahāraurava, Rauraya, Asipatrayana, Kālasūtra and Ayici and (in IT, 6 2-5) names 26 narakas, Saṅkha-Likhita as quoted by the Madanapārijāta pp 694-695 mentions in detail the torments that evil-doers undergo in the he]ls called Kum bhīpāka, Raurava, Mahāraurava &amp;c. Manu IV. 88-90, Yāj. II, 222-224, Visnu Dh, S. 43, 2-22, Agnipurāna 371. 20-22, Nārada (pralirnaka 44) enumerate 21 narakas. The names are almost the same in all these works, the variations being due mostly to the scribes having read certain letters differently.

<p>V. 6,2-5, Skandapurāna I, chap. 39 and VL 226-227, In the Mārkandeyapurāna ( chap 12) we have a description of several Darakas like the Rauraya, Mahāraurava, Asipatrarana &amp;c and chap 14 (verses 39-94) mentions the punishments moted out to perpetrators of various sins In the Mahabharata also narakas and the torments thereof are frequently referred to For example, Sāntiparva 321 32 speaks of Vaitaradt and Asipatravana, Anuśāsana ( 23 60-82) speaks of the actions that lead to hells(each yerse having the refrain te var noraya-gāmnah) Anuśāsana 145.10-13. Svargārohanika-parva (2 16-26) describes the several horrible sights and torments of such hells as * Asipatravana&rsquo; (named in verse 23 ) and Kūtaśālmalı (named in Svargarohanika 34). The Vrddha-Hārita-smrti (IX. 167-171) mentions almost the same 21 narakas as the Manusmrti does. The craza for multiplying Darakas went so far that the Brahmapurāps, the Visoudharmottara 395, the Garuda-purāna and others declared that there were thousands, lakhs and crores of narakas,</p>
<p>The Visnu Dh, S. (46, 23-29) provides that those guilty of atipātakas, anupatakas, sankarīkarana, who have not under gone prāyaścıttas suffer respectively for one Kalpa,395a for one Manyantara, for four Yugas, for a thousand years in the 21 Darakas in rotation and the other sinners for many years. Yama quoted by the Madanapārijāta p. 696 says that those guilty of Mahāpātakas stay in Hell with face downyards for a yuga and Yama has numerous other verses stating what sinners undergo which horrors of Hell.</p>
<p>Buddhists appear to bave borrowed the doctrine about hells from Brahmanical writers Vide Dr B O. Law&rsquo;s mono graph on &lsquo;Heaven and Hell in Buddhist perspective&rsquo; (1925), pages 111-113. which refer to eight Mahānisayas and there are other - Jesse Hells. The eight Mahānirayas are Saājīva, Kālasutta, Sanghāta, Roruva, Mahāroruya, Tapa, Mahātapa and Avici. It will be noticed how those names agree closely with Manu&rsquo;s 1156</p>

<p>There are very gloving descriptions of Heaven ( svarga) in the Mahabharata, the Purānas and other works. We bave already seen how Heaven was supposed to be a place of delights in the Rgveda and even in the Upanisads like Katha (I. 12-13 and 18</p>
<p>sobātigo modate syargaloke&rsquo;). Rg. X. 107.2 affirms that those vho give (large) daksnā stand bigb in the Heavens ( as stars), those that donate horses go in the company of the Sun and those that donate gold become immortal. An3% echo of this is found in Vanaparya 186,9. The Kaus Up 13 speaks of several worlds (lokas) of the gods such as those of Agni, Vāgu, Varuda, Āditya, Indra, Prajāpati, Brahmā and a similar gradation of higher worlds is described in Br. Up. III.6 (such as Devaloka, Indraloka, Prajāpatiloka, Brahmaloka) The Br. Up. 1.5. 16 speaks of manusyaloka, pitrioka and devaloka and holds that deraloka is the best of all worlds 311 Eans, Up. 1. 4 implies that in the heavenly world divine nymphs, garlands, collyrium, fragrant powder, garments wait upon the fortunate depizons. Saṅkara on Vedānta-sūtra (IV. 34) says that the word &lsquo;loka&rsquo; means &ldquo;a place for enjoying the fruits of one&rsquo;s actions</p>

<p>Brahmapurāna, 225.5-6. Vanaparra (chap. 261 verses 28-29) says that there is one great draw-back in going to hearen,riz, that there one simply enjoys the rewards of one&rsquo;s good actions, no new merit is accumulated there, one simply subsists on the accumu. lated principal or store of merit and that when that store is exhausted one has to fall down, the only good point about this being that one is born a man and that too in such a way that he enjoys398 happiness, Apuśāsana (23. 84–102) sets out numerous actions whereby a man attains heaven (each Terse having the refrain &lsquo;te narāh svarga-gāminah&rsquo;) Similarly, in Brahmapurada 224. 9-14, 18-25 and 30-37 we have the same refrain. Vide also Anuśāsana chapters 144 (verses 5-15, 19-26, 31-39) and 145 Santi (99. 4-5) states that syarga is full of those fallen in battle, there are Gandharva damsels there for the brave (and there is bell for the coward) and that svarga Fields all desiras that one may entertain. The Santiparta (192.8 and 21 ) states that syarga was in the North, that (Sānti 191 19,193 27) there vas neither hunger nor thirst nor weariness nor old age nor sin (in Heaven), that good men (Santi 271, 24) are seen as stars (or become stars). In the Matsyapurāpa (276 17) it is 399 stated that he who performs Brahmāndadāns (one of the 16 malādānas) reaches the world of Viṣou and delights in the company of Apsarases. The Brahmapurāna (225. 6-7) assures us that a generous donor goes to beaven where he enjoys the best pleasures in the company of Apsarases and in the beatedly garden called Nandana and when he falls down from heaven he is born as a portal in a rich and noble family. Vide a]so Garudapurāns IL 3.86-89. It is not necessary to multiply passages. There are two matters to be noted in connection with Heaven and its pleasures, One is the calculating or bargaining spirit which the smrtis and purānas display viz. make this or that gift and then there is so much delight to be enjoyed in heaven, a sort of profit and loss account; and the second is that the highest</p>

<p>Lamitations on pleasures of Heaven</p>
<p>pleasures of Heaven have a time limit, i, e. they are to come to an end one day and the meritorious have to be born again in mortal bodies. The doctrine was gradually evolved that there is no final release from the cycle of births and deaths by the performance of meritorious deeds alone</p>
<p>It is not necessary to set out at length the gruesome torments of Hell described in great detail in several smrtis and purānas. By way of a sample, the following description taken from a Dharmaśāstra work (viz. Visnu Dh, S. 43.32-45) will be quite enough. &ldquo;Sinners guilty of having committed (one or more of the nine kinds of) sins have to endure terrible sufferings when they have left this life and reached the path of Yama. Being dragged hither and thither by the fierce servants of Yama they are led (to hell) by them with frightening gestures, (In Hell) they are devoured by dogs, jackals, crows, herons, cranes and other birds eating raw flesh, by snakes and scorpions that haya fire in their mouths (i. e. that emit stinging poison). They are scorched by fire, pierced by thorns, divided into parts by saws and oppressed by thirst. They are afflicted with hunger and by terrible hordes of tigers and they faint away at every step on account of the stinking smell of pus and blood, Desiring to secure the food and drink of others they are beaten by the servants (of Yama) whose faces are similar to those of such horrible animals as Crows, berons and cranes. In some places they are boiled in oil, in others they are pounded with pestles or ground down in iron or stone vessels. In some places they * (have to eat what is vomitted or pus or blood or excrements, and hideous meat smelling like pus. In one place they have to stay in terrible darkness, and are devoured by horrible worms having flames in their mouths. In some places they are over whelmed by cold or have to pass through the midst of unclean things and in other places the departed devour each other, thus becoming most horrible, In some places they are beaten on account of their former deeds and are suspended in other places (from trees &amp;c.) or are struck with heaps of arrows or are cut into pieces. In other places they have to tread upon thorns and they are encircled by the hoods of serpents, they are tor mented with machines and are dragged by their knees. Their backs, heads and neoks are fractured, they become terrible (to look at ), their throats being reduced to the size fit for a care shelter and they become unabje to bear torments. Sinners are being tormented in this way and having suffered intopse</p>

<p>That naraka is a place below the earth is frequently stated in the Purādas For example, in the Garuda and Brahmānda purānas all Hells such as Raurava are stated to be situated below the earth. Vide Vispupurāna II 6.1 also. The Bhāga vatapurāna states that Hells are below the earth and above water to the south of the three worlds and hang without support, in which dwell the troups of pitrs called Agnisvõtta and others. 400 The Agnipurāna (371 13-14) avers that the 28 groups of narakas are below the earth and even below the 7th Patala</p>
<p>We come across Vedic passages such as these &lsquo;This sacri ficer who is possessed of the utensils of yara directly reaches Heaven&rsquo; (Sat. Br.

Parāśara, 40% an astronomer and a predecessor of Varāha-mihira quoted by Utpala on Br.

<p>nountain Meru, 84000 yojanas high and sixteen below and hrice as much in length and width, which is called syarg&amp;, But it would be far from the truth to say that all eminent yriters were agreed on the actual existence of svarga and laraka as places. It has already been shown how several jenturies before Christ Gautama refers to the view of some predecessors of his that naraka is not a place, but simply means he loss of the capacity to perform the peculiar actions of one&rsquo;s vai na There were others who argued in the same strain, Jabara (on Jai IV. 3. 27-28) quotes a Vedic passage where the view of the sage appears to be that sacrifices yield the reward promised by śruti in the next life and where Kumātila. 403 in his brief comment propounds the view that the injunctive passage (vidhi) of the Veda only promises a reward but does not state that it follows immediately in this life, that syarga which means unsurpassed joy, can happen only in another life, On Jaimini VI. 1. 1. Sabara first puts forward the prima facie view that svarga 404 imports in popular language such things (dravya) as fine silken clothes, sandalwood paste, young damsels only 16 years old and that the word svarga is also popularly applied to a particular place where there is neither heat por cold, neither hunger nor thirst, neither distress nor fatigue and where only those that have done meritorious deeds can reach and not others. Sabara refutes this view and holds that the primary meaning of the sword svarga is joy 905 or delight and not a thing (dravya) which brings joy.</p>

<p>pain, which is not immediately afterwards overwhelmed (by pain) and which is present whenever desired, is denoted by the word svah (or svarga). The Prakarana-pancikā of Salika nātba, 400x one of the early works of the Prabhākara Mimānsā sohool, affirms that in such sentences as &lsquo;one desirous of heaven should perform the Jyotistoma&rsquo; the rite is simply commended by Vedic passages, which are no more than arthavādas, as a means of securing long-enduring happiness which is free from the taint of all kinds of sorrow and which is present at the mere desire of the enjoyer. The Sāntiparva expressly states &ldquo;The wise do not regard the other world as directly seen by anyone; one has to entertain faith (in the existence of the other world) because otherwise one may run counter to the Vedas.&rsquo; 407 The Bralımapurāpa and the Visnupurāda speak in the same strain as Sabara that svarga is what causes bappiness to the mind, that narake is the opposite of it and that meritorious deeds and wicked deeds are designated as svarga and naraka respectively and that syarga and naraka are really states of the mind characterised by happiness and pain respectively.108 ! One need not wonder at the crude ideas of naraka and svai ga entertained by most ancient Indian writers and works. The same ideas were pravalent among peoples of all religions a]] the world over. For example, The Egyptians whose dynastic history covers a period of about 5000 years had very remarkable beliefs about Heaven and Hell which were illustrated with pictorical representations copiously (as no other nation had ever done), although the oldest Books of the Dead are without illustrations of any sort (vide E. A. W, Budge&rsquo;s &lsquo;Egyptian Heaven and Hell&rsquo;, 1905 p. XI and 2). Sheo] was the name the Hebrews gave to the gloony abode of the dead in the lowest parts of the earth and it was a land of darkness, which was appointed as the house for all living (Job 10, 21-22 and 30. 23) The Greek Hades closely resembles the Hebrew Sheol in its chief characteristics. In the New Testament also Hell is &amp; land of everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels and it is a place where the wicked go into everlasting torment &quot; 406 , ज्योतिष्टोमेन स्वर्गकामो यजेतेत्येवमादिसमाम्नायं सकलदु खसम्भेदरहिताभिला. giaditing and rṛ để hī tại Thất (P 102 ). . .407. न हपूर्व प्रत्यक्ष परलोक विदुर्बुधा । आगमास्त्वनतिक्रम्य श्रद्धातव्य बुभूषता। 3 28 42. - A08. mostrar man hargcafqI 7</p>

The words of the New Testament are plain enough that Heaven was supposed to be a place above the earth and the clouds and that Hell was a place below the earth full of darkness and torments. Vide Luke 23. 43, Ephesians I 3 and 20, II. Cor. 12, 4, Rev.2.17; and Luke 12.5 and 16.23; II.

Even men of genius like Shakespeare and most Christian theologians 409 down even to modern times believed in a literal interpretation of passages from the Bible which speak of Heaven and Hell as places. It is only recently that many Christians have begun to hold that the language of the Bible about Heaven and Hell is purely symbolical in character 410.</p>

<p>The Sacrtis had evolved the doctrine, as stated above, that if &amp; sinner did not undergo prāyaścitta, he had to suffer tora ments in hell, thereafter he became born as some insect or lower animal or a tree on account of some remnants of his sins and that he was born as a human being afflicted with certain diseases or vith defects. 411 These last two consequences are described under the title karmavipaka (the fruition of evil deeds).

Heaven is also a fellowship of fioite spirits &quot; It will be patent how modern European miads have begun to thiok of Heaven and Hell in terms analogous to those in which some of the best minds of India thought of them centuries before and After the Christian era la spite of the glowiog pictures of the pleasures of Heaven and terrifying descriptions of the torments of Hell detailed in many of the sacred and popular works in Sanskrit and other Indian languages people have gone on committing all sorts of sins. The ancient machinery of Heavens and Hells must be deemed to bave largely failed of its purpose 10 these days. Large masses of men appear to be slipping into an abyss of despair, misery, bardness of heart, wapton brutality and lawlessness The lurid accounts of bombings and pight raids on big cities, the reports of the bloody battles for six years 10 the World War No 2, the harrowing tales of tortures in such prisoners' camps as at Belsen, the phenomenal rise in the prices of all necessities of life (food, clothing and shelter), frequent stribes and struggles between the employed and the industrialists, growing indisciplipe, arson, plonder and bestial treatment of human beings on the ground of race or religion have produced bardness of bears and debased large masses of Indian people. It is a very difficult question for our leaders how to revive among the common people of India, (wbom Westerners dubbed muld Hindus) the old characteristics of tolerance, peacefulness, goodwill and respect for human life and property, how to build up a new fabric of society, a new civilization and culture on the ancient Upadisadıc foundations of the parsnit of Reality, brotherhood of man, the unity of all life, and love of mankind even without pressing into service the ancient and medieval literal conceptions of Heaven and Hell,</p>

<p>ins that have not undergone prāyaścitta are, after undergoing ihe torments of Hell, born with bodies marked with certain zondemned signs. One guilty of grave sins bears ṣuch signs For seven births, one guilty of upapātaloc for five births and one Quilty of pāpz for three births. These marks indicative of their baving committed a particular sin are observed in each</p>
<p>ife and only disappear after they repent and perform prāya &lsquo;citta. Similarly, the diseases arising from sinful deeds sub side by adopting the remedies of the recitation of Vedic jexts, vorship of gods, homas and gifts,&rsquo; Verses 6-10 specify the diseases that arise in consequence of sing such as leprosy, tuberculosis, gonorrhoea, dysentery, kidney trouble, stone in the bladder, cough, fistula &amp;c. A man may commit sins of three kinds viz. by the body, in words and mentally (Manu XII. 3). Really speaking, it is the mind that is the spring of all actions (Manu XII 4), but for the sake of convenience, this threefold division is made. Coveting another&rsquo;s wealth by unfair means, desiring that evil should befall another and persistence in false ideas (such as the one that there is no soul, but that the body is the soul)-these three are mental sins (Manu XII. 5). Harshness of speech, falsehood, backbiting and irrelevant prattling those four are vocal sins (ibid XII, 6). Appropriating to onese]f another&rsquo;s wealth without his consent, injury to sentient beings against the injunctions of sastra, sexual intercourse with another&rsquo;s wife&ndash;these three are bodily sins (ibid. XI. 7). Manu provides that bodily sins reduce a man to the state of a fixed object (tree &amp;c.), vocal sins reduce bym to the state of birds and beasts and mental sins to the lowest castes (Capdāla and the like). Harita (q. by Par, M )412 speaks of 18 evil actions that lead to hell, of which six are mental, four vocal and the rest are bodily sins. Manu XII. 54-59 and 62-68, Yaj. III 131, 135 136, 207-208 and 213-215, Vispu Dh, S: Chap. 44, Atri Chap, 45-14, 17-44 (in prose) state into what animals, trees and creep ors sinners are born after undergoing hell torments. The state monts of Yāj being concise are set out here. This soul enters into hundreds of bodies in this saṁsāra, viz, as one of the lowest castes, bird or fixed object (tree &amp;c) on account of his lapses spring ing from the mind, speech and body (Ya).

TIT 207-208). On stealing leafy vegetables one is born as a peacock, on stealing perfumes one is born a chuchundari (musk-rat), the thief of corn, of a vehicle, fruits, water, milk, domestic utensils (like pestle), honey, flesh, a cow, fire, cloth, juice (of sugarcane or the like) and salt is born respectively as a mouse, a camel, a monkey, a playa (duck), a crow, a sparrow, bee, vulture, godkā (iguana), orane, a man suffering from wlijte leprosy, a dog, cii (cricket bird). The Brahmapurana (chap 217 verses 37–310) contains a long dis quisition on the different kinds of animal births that sinners of various kinds have to undergo Vide also Garudapurāna (Protakhanda) 2 60-88, Agni 371 30-32 (which latter states that the murderer of a brāhmada is born as a beast or deer or a dog, bog, or camel, the drinker of wine as an ass or pukkasa or mleccha, the thief of gold as a worm or pest or moth, one guilty of incest as grass or a bush).</p>
<p>It was believed in yery ancient times that diseases were the consequences of sins413 In the Atharyaveda VIII. 7.3 plants are said to have destroyed from each limb the disease due to sin:14. Manu XI. 49-52, Vas. 2044, YāII. 209-211, Visnu Dh. S Chap 45, śātātapa I. 3-11 and II, 1, 30, 32, 47, Gautama. smrti in verze chap 20 and Gautama (in prose g by the Mit on Yā).

<p>p. 861), Yama (g by Pr. M. 09), Saṅkha (q. by the Mitaksarā on Yaj. III. 216 ), Smrtyarthasāra pp. 99-100 state the diseases and bodily defects from which sinners suffer after they are born as men. As a sample Yāj. III. 209-211 may be cited here; the murderer of a brāhmana suffers from Tuberculosis, a drinker of surā has black teeth, the thief of brāhmana&rsquo;s gold has diseased nails, one guilty of incest suffers from leprosy; the thjef of food suffers from dyspepsia, one who stealthily learns without permission (or one guilty of plagiarism) is born dumb, one who mixes up inferior corn with superior corn is born with excessive limbs (with six fingers &amp;c.), a backbiter is born with pus in the nose; a thief of oil is born as tilapāyī and one who falsely reports faults in others has a foetid breath. Yāj. III. 217 states that after reaping the consequences of their (evil) deeds (by falling into Hell and) by reaching the state of lower animals, sinners are born as human beings of a low order, poor and with con demned marks on the body; even medical works like the Carakasambita held the belief that diseases were the con sequences of actions done in past lives (vide Sūtrasthāna, Chap. I 116),</p>
<p>. The smrtis are not in complete agreement about the diseases or bodily defects that sinners of various grades suffer. For example, though Vas 20 44 and Saṅkha (q by Mit, on Yaj. ITI, 216 ) state that the murderer of a brāhmana suffers from leprosy, Manu XI. 49, Yāj III, 209, Visnu Dh. S 45. 3, Agni, 371, 32 aver that he suffers from phthisis. For want of space the long lists of the births as lower animals and the diseases and deformities from which sinnors suffer contained in Saṅkha, Hārsta, Gautama, Yama and the Purāpas quoted by the Mit.. on Yāj IL 216, the Par M. I. part 2 pp. 230-240, 242-272, Madanapārijāta pp 701-702, the Mahārnava-karnavipaka are passed over here,</p>
<p>Āp. Dh. S (II. 1. 2. 6-7) states that a brāhmana, ksatriya or vaiśya sinner guilty of brāhmana murder, after undergoing the tornients of Hell is born again respectively as a Candāla, Paulkasa and Vaida and that other sinners who have become outcasts by their sins are born on account of these as certain animals (like pigs) Similarly, Manu XIL 61 provides that one who from greed steals precious stones, pearls, corals and jewels of various kinds is born as a goldsmith.</p>

<p>Although the word Karman is ordinarily employed to denote good as well as evil actions still in the section on pen ances the word &lsquo;Karman&rsquo; prominently presents to the mind the idea of evil deeds. Hence Karmavipāka means the ripening (or fruition) of evil actions or sins This fruition takes three forms, as stated in the Yogasūtrā:15 I 13, viz jātı (birth as a worn or animal &amp;c), āyuh (life i. e living for a short period such as five or ten years) and bhoga (experiencing the torments of Hell &amp;c) The vord Karmavipaka appears to have been known to Yā). III 131 (vipakaḥ karmanām pretya kesām cid-iha jāyate) and it occurs frequently in the Purānas (e g in Brahma-purapa 224 41, 225 43 and 59, Matsya 115 14 &amp;c). The Pr, Sāra pp. 219-231 contains probably the longest treatment of Karna vipaka The doctrine of Karmavipāka was well known to the Buddhist philosopher Nāgārjuna, who in his Ratnāvali refers to it416 The Buddhist Avadānaśatakas also refer to the doctrine of Karmavipāka. Vide also Suttanipāta (S B. E vol 10 part 2) p. 38 and S B. E vol 21 p. 130 (Saddharma-pundarika ). In some medical works also such as the Haritasamhita it is said that the murderer of a brāhmana suffers from white Jeprosy and the killer of a cow from black leprosy ; a regicide suffers from phthisis, and the destroyer of a park frum dysentery &amp;c.417. In the Vivāgasuyam (Vipākaśrutam), which is the 11th anga of the Jaina-āgama and an edition of which was brought out by Dr. P L Vaidya (in 1933) we have stories of persons who suffered from evil diseases ovving to their committing evil deeds in former lives and other stories of the fruits of good deeds.</p>

<p>The Mit, on Yaj. IL 216), the Smṛtyarthasāra, Par. Mi, Pr. Sāra and other works state that the disquisition on Karmavipāka420 is merely an arthavuda, that it is not to be taken literally, but is meant to induce sinners to updergo such prāyaścittas as Prājāpatya which entail great worry and trouble and which no one might willingly undertake, The Mit points out that the description of the diseases (like pthisis) is not intended for requiring those who suffer from &quot; them to undergo the penances for twelve years or the like nor for induc ing people to avoid contact with such persons, that śistas do not avoid contact with those who have bad nails, that in the case of soch persons the disease or defect is the last result of wbat little sin remained attached to them and that by the very fact of their having the disease or defect mentioned in the texts they become free from the last remnants of their sins and therefore they do -Dot stand in need of any further panance and as their sin is -finally removed by suffering the disease or defect their fitness</p>
<p>for being allowed to mix among people is established</p>
<p>The teaching of the works on Karmavipaka, though dismai 80d terrifying, comes to this that no soul Reed be without hope provided it is prepared to wait and undergo torments for its mis deeds, that it need not be appelled by the numerous existences foreshadowed in those works and that the soul may in its long passage and evolution be ultimately able to discover its true greatness and realize eternal peace and perfection.</p>
<p>Manu XII. 69 (almost the same as Vispu Dh, S. 44.45 and Garudapurāna II 2. 89) states that women guilty of the sin of theft become the wives of men who are guilty of the same offences.</p>

<p>Varāhapurana (chap. 203 21 ff ) expatiates at length upon the topic how sinners endure torments in Hell for innumerable years, how after their evil deeds have been almost wiped out they become human beings suffering from various diseases or deformities. i In the Mahārnaya-karmavipāka of Mandhātr it is stated that there are two means of destroying the consequences of (evil). actions, viz krochira (penances) and the reversal (or remedies) against diseases $21. The latter consists in making golden images of the sun (as the superintending deity of good health ) and of the deity of a disease and offering worship to both these in a mandapa on a raised vedıkā (plat form). The work expatiates at length on the Vedic verses employed according to Asyalāyana and the Taittiriya Sākhā for ghosa-sūntt (propitiatory ceremonies with loud recitation of Vedic mantras); the worship of the sun with Vedic mantras and of the planets, the offerings of ahutus, the Rudraikādasini, Mahārudra (11 times as many as the preceding) and Ati rudra, repeating the thousand names of Vispu, Vināyaka śānti (as laid down by Yāj. I. 271-294), Navagraha-yajña in which it assigns each planet to some country and some gotra *22. It also prescribes how for the removal of particular diseases particular dānas may be given (such as Kadalidāna i e. manufacturing a kadalı plant from one pala of gold and donat ing it). It deals with the gifts of the images of all diseases supposed to be incurable and quotes Śātātapa II. 47-48 in con nection with the removal of rājayaksmā (phthisis). It deals at length with fevers and other diseases and bodily defects such as greenish or cat-like eyes, deafness &amp;c. But the detai led treatment of all these matters is passed over here from considerations of space, and also for the reason that these prescriptions are now either hardly believed in by people or hardly ever performed.</p>
