CHAPTER II 

MEANS OF REDUCING CONSEQUENCES OF SINS 

Confession-In Āp. Dk S. 1. 9. 24. 15, 1. 10. 28. 19, 1. 10.29. 1 it is prescribed that the parson undergoing a penance for being an ableśasta or for unjustly forsaking his wife or for the murder of a learned brāhmana has to declara his misdeed while begging for alus to support himself. The Vedic student who was guilty of sexual intercourse had also to proclaim his lapse while begging at seven houses (Gaut, 23.18, Manu XI 122 ) 98 

Repantance (anutāpa)ManuXL 229-230 (=Vispudharn ołtara II. 73 231-32 ) provide: "The more a inan's mind loathes his own evil deed the more does his body become freed from the unrighteousness (comınitted by him). If after committing a sin a man feals repentance for having done it he becomes free from that sin. He becomes purified only by the resolution of ceasing to sin and thinking 'I shall not do so again". 100 The Vispupurāpa II. 6.40 lays emphasis on repentance and humble devotion to Krspa. Pr. V, (p. 30 ) quotes a verse of Angiras 'A man after committing sins, if he is consuined by repentance and is sorry day and night (for his misdeed), is purified by prānāyāma'. The view of digests like the Pr. Prakasa is that 

98 Confession of sins has played a prominent part in early and medie val Christianity. For example, (First epistle on) Joho I. 9 says "If we confess our sias, he is farthéal and just to forgive us our sigs and cleause us from all uprighteouspess'. 

99. Maou XI, 229 also occurs in EITTO 218. 5. 

100. Compare Christ's call to repentance 10 Matthew 4. 17 and Mark I 15 abd his last words (in Luke 24 47) that 'repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his game among all Dations'. araa \#HT नित्यं दुग्छतान्यचिन्तयन् । तपस्वी चाममत्तश्च पापेग्य. स प्रमुच्यते ॥ इति कल्पतरूवाहत. वास्येन तपतिपदोपादानात् ...पुनरनिराः। विकर्मणा तप्यमान पापाद्धि परिमुच्यते । इति । अत्रानुतापमात्रस्य पापनाशकत्वानुपपत्त- पापनाशकमायश्चिते अधिकारिविशेषणवेन पापनाश.

Prānāyāma (rostraint of the wreath ) Vido H of Dh. vol II P 317 for a description of this Manu XI. 248 (which is the sono as Baud. Dh S IV 131, Vas, 264, Atri II. 5, Sapkhasmrti XII 18-19 ) lays down 'sixteen prānāyāmas attended by the Vyāhrtis and the Pranava ( omkāra ), if per formed every day, would purify astor a month oven the murderer of a blirūna (a learned brālmana). Viṣṇu Db S. 55.2 (in prose) 18 to the same effect. Vas 26 1-3 provide that on the proper performance of three prānāyāmas all the sins committed by day or in the night are at once destroyed Yā). ITI 305 states that for the removal of all sins, of upapatakas and of sins for which no special expiation is provided by the texts one lundred prādāyāmas should be performed. This refers to sins not known to others for which expiation is to be porformed sccietly. Baud Dh. S (IV 15-11) provides for varying mimbers (3, 7, 12 ) of prānāyāinas to be spread over one day to a year for different kinds of sins ranging from the eating of the food of a śūdra to brāhmana murder This wholo passage is quoted by the Mit on Yā, III, 305 which points out the kinds of sins at doals with Tho Agnipulāna 173.21 has the same half vcrso as Yā).

Tapas (austerity) Even Rg X 154 % spoaks of tapus as leading to heaven and ag iinassailable. The Chān. Up V 10 1-2, Mundaka Up I 2 10-11 place tapus over yajña Gaut 1915 says that celibacy, 101 truthfulness, bathing tlirico daily (in the morning, at noon and in the evening), wearing wet clothes 

(till they are dried on the body), sleeping on the ground (on raised part or altar) and fasting constitute austerities Baud DI S HI 10 13 adds to these alirmsā' (non-injury to any being), aslannya (not depriving any one of liis property) and guid susi ūsā (attendance upon a teacher) Gaut, 19 17 states thal

Tapis (anster ilies) 

the periods for which tapas is to be observed are a year, six months, four months, three months, two months, one (month), 24 days, 12 days, 6 days, 3 days, a day and a night, (according to the nature of the sin). Manu XI. 239-2-41 declare that those guilty of mahāpātakas and others guilty of evil deeds are freed from sins by well-practised tapas and that whatever sins are committed by people in thought, word and bodily actions are all quickly burnt by tapas This doctrine is shared by th: Jainas as stated in the Uttaradhyayana XXIX 27 'by austerities he cuts off karman' (S B. E. vol 45 p. 166). 

Homa (sacrifice into fire). The Tai. A. (II 7-8) describes 102 the kūsmānda homa and dīkṣā and II. 8 prescribes that the man who regards himself as impure should offer a sacrifice with the kūsmānda mantras (mentioned in Tai Ā. II3-6, viz. 'yaddeva deya-bedanam' (Vaj. S 20 14-16-Tai. A. II 3.1) The Mahārpava karmavipāka (folio 8 a) prescribes the procedure of Kūsmānda homa taken from Jawadagni which is brief. It is as follows.“ After shaving the hair on the head and the moustache and taking a bath in holy water one should offer the ajyabhāgas and then offer oblations of clarified butter with the three Anuvākas beginning with 'yad deyā deyahedanam,' and then he worships fire with the verses beginning with Vaisyanaraya pratipā dayani' He then offers samıdh with the mantra yadadiya. yam' and then he repeats the Jayā mantras. He has to observe the rules for a diksita viz not eating flesh, avoiding sexual intercourse, not telling a falsehood and not sleeping on a cot. He has to subsist on milk (if he is a brāhmana), on barley gruel if a ksatriya and on āmiksā if he is avaisya, The Kūsmanda-homa as prescribed by Baudhāyana is a longer one The Baud, Dh. S. II. 71 prascribes that he who considers himself impure should offer burnt oblations reciting the kūsmānda mantras, that he who has had forbidden intercourse becomes even like a thief or even like a slayer of a learned brāhmada

and that (by performing homa with kūsmāndas) he becomes free from any sin that is less than the murder of a learned brahmana Ya) IIT, 309 provides that whenever a twice-born man feels himself mixed up in heavy sins he should perform a homa with sesame with the sacred Gāyatri manira. The Mit following a verse of Yama says that one lakh of offerings of sesame must be made. Both Manu XI. 34 and Vas 26 16 say that a brāhmana becomes free from all distrasses by Vedic recitations (japa) and sacrifices (homa). When the wife con fessed to the existence of a paramour, the Sat. Br. Il 5 2. 20 states that she made an offering into the Dahsinūgni with the mantra (Vaj S. IIT 45) 'whatever103 sin we have committed, whether in the village, in the forest, in society or by the organs of sense, we cast that away by this sacrifice, svāhā.' Both Manu (VII 105) and Yāj (II, 83) prescribe that when vitness tells a falsehood in order to prevent an accused person from be ing sentenced to death, he should offer for expiating his perjury an oblation of boiled rice to Sarasvati There are other homas also prescribed such as the Ganahoma, in which such Terses as 'agne naya supathā' from the Taittirfya śākhā are recited (Mahārnava). 

The old idea of sacrifice seems to have been that it was propitiatory in character Sacrifice was not demanded or required by God. Sacrifice 'vas probably regarded as a gift which pleased God, induced Him to forgive a man for his transgressions and enabled erring man to regain God's favour which had been lost by some shortcoming or some sinful act Sacrifices therefore had an expiatory or cleansing function or character. Sacrifices may be performd by offerings either an animal (meant as substitute for the sinner himself who had forfeited his life for his sins and transgressions) or a burnt offering or any other thing offered to God and then distri buted to others. 

Japa (muttering of Vedic passages as prayers) Japa is of three kinds, vācihaz (audibly uttered), upūnsul (inaudibly uttered) and mūnasa (nentally revolved), each succeeding one being ten times superior, acc to Laghu Hārsta IV. p 186,

Japa (repeating Vedic prayers) (Jivananda L.).104 Sabara (on Jai. XIL. 4. 1) distinguishes japa from stutt, the former being simply an utterance or recitation of a mantra or mantras105. Inaudible japa is praised 106 in Saṅkhāyana Br. 14, 1. The Āśy. Śr 11 20 provides that japa, anumantrana, āpyāyana and upasthāna are uttered upamsu. The Ap. Sr (24 1, 8-10 ) provides that mantras from the Rgveda and the Sāmaveda are uttered in sacrifices loudly and that passages of the Yajurveda are muttered upāmśu and the Tai. Pratisakhya. 23.6 states that upamsu recitation is made by means of the effort of speech organs but without sound (i.e. in a very low voice) and without the mind being directed (to utterance with udātta and other accents) i e. 'Karanavad asabdam-amanah-prayogam-upamsu'. Gaut. 19.12 (- Baud. Dh. S. II, 10 10=Tas 229) prescribes the following Vedic texts as purifiers: Upanisads, Vedānta texts, the Samhitā texts of all the 

Vedas (and not the padapotha or kramapatha), the Yajus texts in 

• which the word 'madhu' occurs, the Aghamarsana hymn (Rg, 

x. 190 1-3), the Atharvasiras, (the anuvakas called) Rudras, the Purusa hymn (Rg. X. 90), the two sūmans called Rājata and Rauhineya, the Brhat-sama and the Rathantara, the Purusagati saman, the Mahānāmni verses, the Mahāvairāja. (sāmam), the Mahadivakirtya (saman), any of the Jyestha. samans, the Bahispayamāna. (saman), the Kusmāndas, the Pavamānis (Rs. IX) and the Savitri (Rg. III6210). 107 The

original idea of japa was highly spiritual. Deep knowledge of the Upanisads and other texts would have made the soul pura and enabled it to realize the supreme reality and induced in the mind love of all human beings as sparks of the one Divine Essenco, Japa at the highest level was contemplation of God and endeavour to attain unity with God The habit of repeat ing the sacred texts should lead to maintaining the soul in the presence and thought of God Japa demands three thinga, purity of leart, detachment and placing oneself in the hands of God

Mamu I 85-87 (which are the gapie as Vās, 26 9-11 and Viṣṇu Dh S 55. 10-21) lay108 down: 'the performance of japa is ten times more efficacious than the sacıifices (like Darsapūrnan māsa) prescribed by the rules (or the Veda), hapa when carried on inaudibly is a bundred times superior (to sacrifices) and niental revolutiou of mantras is a thousand times superior The four pākayajñas 109 (Vaiśvadeva, buli, daily śūddha, and hono uring guest) together with the Vedic sacrifices do not come up to even the 16th part of yapa. A brāhmana attains perfection (tlie liighest goal) by japa; he may or way not engage in other duties (such as Vedic sacrifices), a brāhmana befriends all creatures'. Great eulogy is bestowed on the inaudible jupa of the Gāyatri mantra (Rg II. 62 10) for which pp. 303-305 of H of Dh. vo), II may be consulted where no particular number is specially mentioned the recitation of a mantra is to be per formed a hundred times.110 

Manu110a XI. 261-262, Vas 27 1-3, Angiras 101 and other works go so far as to assert that the fire of Veda study con sumnes guilt caused by evil deeds just as a fire burning strongly consumes even green trees or that a brābmapa who remenibers Rgveda (studied by him) is not tainted by any guilt, though he may have destroyed the three worlds and have eaten the food of any person whatever But these are simply laudatory(ai thavūdas) and are not to be taken literally, as Vas. 27, 4 111 (-ādgiras 102) gives the warning 'one should not bacoine addicted to (or take pleasure in committing) evil deeds relying on the power of the Veda (stated in some smrti passages). (The effects of) actions done through ignorance and negligence are alone consunisd (by Veda study) and not those of other actions (intentionally done),'

Even he who has stolen gold (of a brāhmana) instantly becomes free from guilt if he once mutters (the hymn) beginning with 'asya vāmasya'i e. Rg I. 164 1-52), and the Śivasaṅkalpa (Va) S XXXIV. 1-6). The violater of a guru's bed is freed from sin if he repeatedly recites the hymn beginning with 'havispāntam' ( Rg. X 88 1-19 ) and the hymn beginning with 'na tam-ambo' (i e. Rg X 126 1-8), the hymn beginning with 'iti' (i e. Rg X 119) and the hymn addressed to Purusa (Rg X 90) He who desires to do away with sins, great and small, should mutter during a year the verse beginning with 'aya' (1 8 'aya te helo Varuna namobhih' Rg I. 24. 14, Tai s I. 5 11 3), or the varse 'yat kim ca' (Rg VII 89 5) or the verse ‘Iti vā' (Rg X 119 1) That man who, having accepted a gift that ought not to be accepted, or having eaten forbidden food, inutters the hymn beginning with 'tarat sa mandr (Rg IX 58 1-4):14 becomes pure after three days He who has committed many sins becomes pure if he recites for a month the hymn beginning with 'Somā rudrā' (Rg VI 74 1-4) and the three verses beginning with 'Aryamapam' (Rg. IV 2 4-6) while he bathes in a river (and not in a pond or other reservoir of water). One guilty of a grievous offence should mutter the seven verses beginning with 'Indram' (Rg I. 106 1-7) A twics-born man removes even yery great guilt by offering clarified butter for a year (in fire) with the mantras for the Śakalahomas (Vāj 8 VIII 13) or by muttering the

mantra 'nama id-ugram' (Rg. VL 51. 8) One who is stained by mortal sin becomes pure if with a concentrated mind he attends cows for a year, reciting the Pāvamāni hymns (the whole of Rg. IX) and subsisting on alms 114a 

So much importance and such occult povers came to be attached to the words of the Rgveda that the Rgvidhāna of Saunaba (which is later than Manu) concerns itself with prescribing numerous hynins of the Rgveda for the removal of Farious diseases, of sins, for the conquest of enemies 

The Sama Br I. 5 says 115 generally that when no parti cular hymns are prescribed for the removal of sins Vedic mantras are powerful and become purifiers if accompanied by tapas and the Sāmans may be repeated for the same purpose from ten times as the minimum to 100 times as prāyagcitta, Gautama 19. 13 prescribes the kind of food on which one should subsist when one is engaged in japa viz, one was to live on milk alone, to eat vegetables only, to eat fruits only, to live on barley gruel prepared from a handful of grain, to eat gold116, to eat clarified butter, and to drink soma and so forth. Gautama 19.14 further lays down that all mountains, all rivers, holy lakes, places of pilgrimage, the dwellings of sages (rṣıs ), Cowpens and temples of the gods are places (which help to destroy sin). 

As the Veda could be studied in and after the sutra period only by the male members of the first three classes, the japa of Vedic texts for the removal of sins 'was not possible for Śūdras; therefore, the Mit. (on Yāj IIL 262) says that although the sūdra (and women and those born of pratiloma marriages also) has no adhakāra (power or capacity or authority) for the recitation of Gāyatri and other Vedic mantras, still the sūdra and women after revolving in the mind the name of the deity put in the dative case can engage in japa with the word namah (i a he can only utter the yords 'namo namah' and not om &c)

[Vol. as stated by Gaut Dh S. X 66-67 and Yaj. I 121117. When Manu IV. 80 says 'let him not explain to a śūdra the sacred law (dharma) nor impose upon him a vrala' a]] that is meant is, according to the Mit on Yā; II. 262, that it applies only to a Śūdra who does not wait upon or serve higher varpas Similarly, when Gaut IV. 20 says that those born in the inverse order are outside the pale of the sacred law, the meaning is that samshāras like upanayana are not to be performed on them. The mystic syllable 'om' is said by Āp Dh S (1 4 13 6) to be the door to heaven and was to be employed before the recitation of any Vedic passage The Yogasūtra (L 27) avers that om (called pranava) is expressive of the idea of God and that the repetition of om and revo}ving the meaning of it in the mind lead to concentration, 118

V. p 31 quotes a Ferse from the Bhaviṣyapurāball Ba and three verses from the Vispupurāda as follows.-'even a great sin is removed by the resolve of) not doing it again, by gifts, by confessing it to others, and by meditation (on Vispu) and not only by prayaścıttas' (Bhayisya); 'of all the expiations (for sins declared by the sages) such as tapas (Cāndrāyana and others) and other actions (japa, homa, gifts ) the meditation on

Taking the ruime of Hari Krsna is the highest. If a man remembers Nārāyana in the morning, at night, at twilight, at midday and the like, he at once secures the removal of sin' (Vispupurāna). The Brahma. purānal19 (216. 87-88) gives expression to a popular belief as follows:~"Men, even after committing sins many times through folly, do not go to Hell if they prostrate themselves before Hari who destroys all sins. Those men also who always remember Janārdana eyen by roguery go to the world of Vispu after death " The Viṣṇupurāna affirms that those who contemplate upon the mantra of twelye letters (viz. 'om namo bhagavate Vasudevāya') do not return to the cycle of births and deaths. The great power of mantras is mentioned in the Adiparva (161. 14) by Kunti. The Nrsimha-purāna in chap. 18 eulogises the mantra of eight letters (om namo Nārāyapaya) and chap. 63,6, states "what is the use of many mantras and the performance of many vratas, When the mantra 'om namo Nārāyapāya' is capable of securing all desired objects". The mantra of five letters 'namah Sivāya' is dealt with in Lingapurāna (pārvārdha, chap. 85) and Saura purāna 65. Brahma-purāna speaks of vaidika mantras and Ūgamokta mantras (41. 63). The Nityācāra-paddhati (p. 67) says that it is necessary to understand the meaning of Vedic mantras in srauta rites but in smārta rites it is not so. 

Dana (gifts). Gaut. XIX, 16 provides120 that gold, a cow, a dress, a horse, land, sesamum, clarified butter and food are the gifts (that destroy sin) and may be optionally undergone as penance if no express mention is made thereof. Vas. quotes several yerses on gists one of which (29. 16) states: "whatever sin a man distressed for livelihood commits he is purified from that by giving land even if it be as small in extent as 'gocarma'"122. Viṣṇu Dh S. 92.4 is to the same effect. Sam. varta122 (204) prescribes that the gists of gold, cow and land

[Vol. quickly destroy sins even if committed in former lives Medha tithi (on Manu XI. 139) remarks that the verse implies that as to sins arising from injury to living beings gifts are the princi. pal expiations. The subject of dana has been dealt with at length in H. of Dh vol II pp. 837-888 A few further remarks may be made here In many inscriptions and copperplate grants of lands or villages the donor usually states that the grant is made for the increase of the merit of himself and of his parents ( 

eg. E. I vol. XI, p. 219 at p 221). Brhaspati123 as quoted in the Madanaratna (vyavahāra p 66) expressly provides that in land-grants the king should state that he made the gift for securing merit to his parents and to himself124 The Rājatarangini (I 143 ) 125 refers to the founding of whiras (monasteries). 

Upavūsa (fasting). Fasting strictly means total abstin ence from food and drink, but generally it means light diet restricted in quantity and also as regards the nature of the articles taken. Even the Tai s. (I. 6. 7 3-4) referg186 to three ways of observing vrata on the days of the Dar sapūrnamāsa-ists either by subsisting only on food available in the village or on forest food or partaking of no food at all. Gaut 19 11 includes upayāga among the several means of removing sins Tapas is also one of such means acc. to him. But in Gaut, 19 15 as stat ed above, Gaut includes fasting (anāśaha) among 'tapāmsi'.

In Europe the same practice prevailed 10 the middle ages, 'The founder (of monasteries) constantly tells us that this sacrifice is made for the Atonement of bis own $10s and those of bis progenitors and kiosfolk" G, G. Coulton ia 'Five centuries of Religion' (1936) vol III p. 27.

Haradatta explains upavāsa187 as giving up the eating of boiled rice (bhaktatyāga) and adds that upavāsa is again included under tapāīsi to show the great importance attached to it. Haradatta notes that a predecessor of his relying on a Purana passage explained upavāsa in Gaut. 19.11 as 'restraint of senses'. In many of the Grhya sūtras upavasa means only eating light food prepared from corn usable in sacrifices (such as rice) once in the day excluding vegetables, māsa (pulse), salt and flesh (compare Gobbila gr. I. 526, Khādira gr II 1.4 and 6, Kausika sūtra I 31-32, Kathakagrhya 46.2128). The Bļ. Up IV. 4. 22 closely associates 'anāśaka' (fasting) with tapas as a means to the mystic realisation of the Supreme Soul129. Jaimini (III. 8, 9 11) appears to regard fasting as tapas130, Manu XI 203 (=Vispu Dh. S. 54.29) provides that fasting (for a day) is the penance for omitting the rites ordained by the Veda (such as the Darśapūrpamāsa sacrifice and the performance of sandhyā adoration) and for neglecting the special duties oi a snataka (laid down in Manu IV. 34 ff). When a parson vas observing a fast he had to avoid doing certain other actions, Acc to Devala a fast becomes bereft of its good results by drinking water often, by chewing tambulał by sleep in the day-time and by sexual intercourse131 ; but the Garuḍapurada I 128,6 and Bhaviṣya purana (I. 184 27) allow even when one is fasting the use of flowers, ornaments, rich clothes, garlands, unguents, applying collyrium to the eye and the cleansing of teeth. Daksa quoted by the Par M states that if a man observes a fast for the day and night on the day on which the sun first turns towards the

Manu XI 166 (Agnipurāna 169.31) prescribes a fast for three days as a penance for theft of grass, firewood, tree, dry food (i e. grains of rice), jaggery, clothes, hide and flesh. The Anuśāsanaparva (106 1) remarks133 that men of all varṇas and even Mlecchas thought highly of fasts and that chapter contains an exaggerated eulogy of fasting Almost all religions (except Zoroastrianism) such as the Hebrew, Christian (in Lent) and Moslem (in Ramjan) cmphasize the necessity of fasting as a discipline or as a preparation for pentence The Bhaviṣya, purāna (L, chap 16. 12-14) states that those who have not kind led sacred fires can please the gods by vratas, restraints, gifts and particularly by upavāsas and points out (verses 18-22) what substances (eatables) should be given up from the first to the 15th trthi in each fortnight In the Satapatha Brāhmana and the śrauta and grhya sūtias the word upayasatha is used in the sense of 'upayāsa' and is derived from 'vas' (to dwell) with 'upa'. Vide H of Dh. yol I. p 1010 and n 2276 for the Śat Br. The Khādira gr II 1 4, Gobhila gr I. 62, Kausika-sūtra I. 31 employ the word upavasatha Āp Dh S.II 1 1 4-5 prescribe an upavāsa for busband and wife on parvan days and if they cannot totally abstain from food they should eat only once by day food proper for upavāsa Aparārka p. 199, Smr C (srāddha p 355) and Kr̥tya ratnākara quote a veise from Vyāsa deriving the word upayāsa133. The Āp Dh S. II, 5 9-13, Baud, Dh II, 732, Vas 6 21 and Sāp gr. II 165 have the same verse viz. 'an āhitāgni, a draught ox and brahmacārin, these three fulfill (their work) by eating, they cannot fulfill their duties by non-eating'. This is explained as not applying to prāgascittag (Baud. Dh Ś II. 734) and to fasts on Ekādaśī, The śāntiparva 323 17 states 'Just as a dirty garment is after wards cleansed by water, so to those who are heated in the fire of) fasting inexhaustible happiness for a long time comes.' Sānti 79 18, however, says 'merely emaciat ing the body by fasting is not tapas, but ahimsā, truthfulness, freedom from cruelty, restraint and compassion are tapas'.

Tirthayatra ( Pilgrimages) 

Tirthayātrā :-Pilgrimage will be dealt with exhaus tively in a later section. It was believed that going on a pilgrimage and bathing in such holy rivers as the Ganges freed a man īrom sins. Vispu Dh. S. (35.6) lays down that those guilty of maliāpātalas may become pure by Ağvamedlia sacrifice or by visiting all the sacred placas on the earth. Devala says that a man removes the consequences of such grave sins as the murder of a brahmana that he may have committed uninten. fionally by the performance of great sacrifices or by going on a pilgrimage. Parāśara (XII, 58 ff) prescribes 134 pilgrimage to see Rāma's bridge to Lankā for a murderer of a brālmana who has studied the four Vedas. Devala statas: 'a man becomes freed from sin by approaching holy places and shrines, brālman nas that practise austerities, that all livers that fall into the ocean, all great mountains, all shrines and all forests are holy.' The Matsyapurada (184 18) says that a heap of sins as big as the mountain Meru or Mandara beconies destroyed when man reaches Avimukta (Benares), The Kūmnapurāna135 (pūrvārdba 29.3) says 'I do not see any other expiation for destroying all sing in the Kaliyuga for all beings except Benares'. Even in the times of the Peshwas of Poona pilgrimage was prescribed for brāhmapa murder (vide. Selections from Peshwa Records, Vol. 43 p, 107) and the brāhmadas were ordered that after the sinner performed the penance they were to dine with him and recognize that he had been purified In an order dated sake 1659 (1737 AD) the Peshwa Bajirao the first informs the Deshmukhas, Deshpandes and Mukadams that four brothers named Zende approached him with the story that their father was born when their paternal grandmother "lived with one Pilaji Zende after she became a widow and that she intended to remarry that man but that had to be postponed owing to famine, that the caste meeting were prepared to take them into the

Prakāśa quotes & verse froni the Bhaviṣya purāna about the penance for brāhmapa murder to the effect that for him who dwells to the north of the Vindhya mountain Parāśara prescribes the sight of Satubandha os a penance and then remarks that a man from the north of Vindhya has to travel 360 yojanas to reach Setubandha and that since 360 Prājāpatya penances are declared to be enough to remove the sin of brahmahatyā, it impliedly follows that each yojana towards a tirtha is equal to one Prājāpatya, The Smrtyar thasāra (pp. 149-150 ) quotes several verses froin the Purāṇas stating that gods like Brahmā, Viṣṇu and Śiva, great sagos liko Bbrgu, Vasistha and Viśyāmitra, great kings like Hariscandra, Nala, Sagara obtained greatness by means of tirthas and that Pandavas, Sri Krsna, Nārada, Vyāsa and other sages engaged in pilgrimages for securing kingdoms and for removal of evil fortune.
