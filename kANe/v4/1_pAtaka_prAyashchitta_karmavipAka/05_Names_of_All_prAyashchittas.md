CHAPTER V NAMES OF ALL PRĀYAŚCITTAS 

Now all the prāyaścittas mentioned in the smrtis and digests will be arranged in alphabetical order (Sanskrit, transliterated into English), excepting mere hymns, fasts, &c. and brief explanations and references will be added to each. 

AGHAMARSANA-(The hymn Rg. X 190 1-3) 

This is prescribed as a penance for all sins by even the most ancient Dharmaśāstra works such as Gaut 24.11, Baud. Dh S IV. 2 19-20, Vas 268, Manu XI. 259-260, Yāj III 301, Vispu Dh S, 557, Saṅkha 18 1-2 and others. They prescribe that if a man recites (for three days, according to Haradatta) the Agharmarsada hymn thrice in the day while immersed in water for a bath, he is freed from all sins and that this pedance is equal in sanctification to the bath at the end of the Asyamedha sacrifice The Pr. Sāra p 199 speaks of the Aghamarsana vrata He has to fast for three days and stand up by day and sit up by night and donate a milch cow at the end. Saṅkha 18 1–2 and Viṣṇu Dh. 8.46.19 prescribe the details. 

ATIKRCCHRA–Vide under Kr̥cchra Manu XI, 213 prescribes that this penance is constituted by eating only one morsel of food for three days in the morning only, for three days in the evening only, for three days eating one morsel got without asking for it and observing a complete fast for the next three days Yāj II 319, on the other hand, prescribes the eating of just as much food as would fill the hand (and not merely one morsel) The Mit, Pr Sāra (p 176 ) and others state that the rule of Manu applies to those who are able to undergo it, while that of Yay is meant for those who are unable (asakta) The Sāmavidhāna Br. 1.2 6-7, Gaut 26,18-19, Vispu Dh S 54 30, Laugāksigrhya V.12-13, Parāśara X1,54-55, Vas 241-2, Baud Dh S IV 58 also spaak of this Manu 1.208 (= Vispu 54 30) prescribes this penance for striking & brahmana with a weapon or a cudgel Gaut 26 22 states that this penanca purifies a man of all sins except the malūpātahas 

ATISANTAPANA-See under Maha-sāntapana This is variously defined According to the Agnipurāna 171 10 and Viṣṇu Dh S, 46 21 at lasts for 18 days (3 times of the Mahā-santapana in which for six days one has to subsist on cow's urine and five

other things). The Mit on Yāj. II 315 quotes a verse of Yama according to which this penance lasts for 12 days. 296 The Pr. M. (p. 23) speaks of it as lasting for 15 days. 

ARDHAKĄCCHRA-See under Kr̥cchra. According to the Āpastamba-smrti 9 43-44, this is constituted by taking food only oncs in the day for one day, only once in the evening for one day, taking food for two days without asking for it and completely fasting for two days 207 (in all six days). The Mit. quotes another variety of it, viz, subsisting for three days on food obtained without asking for it and thereafter observing a complete fast for three days, 

AŚVAMEDHAVABHRTHASNANA- the ceremonial bath in the sea or a holy river at the end of an Aśvainedha sacrifics. Vispu Dh, S. 36 (last verse) prescribes for those guilty of mahāpātakas and apupātakas the Asyamedha sacrifice. It is only an emperor or a crowned king who is entitled to perform an Aśramedba, at the end of which comes a ceremonial bath. Vide H of Db, vol. II, pp. 1228-1236 for a description of the Aśvamedha According to Pr. V. p. 65 only a ksatriya could perform Aśramedha and so this bath was a penance for him alone. But according to Kullūka (on Manu XI. 92) and Pr. T. (both quoting a verse from Bhavisya-purāna) even a brāhmana could participate in the bath at the end of the Aśramedha and become free from the sin of brālimana murder if committed unintentionally. 298 

AGNEYA KRCCHRA-According to the Agnipurāna and Vispudharmottara if a man subsists for twelve days on sesame alone that is āgneya Kr̥cchra. 299 Vide also Pr Pr. (folio 48 b.)

[Vol. RSICANDRAYANA-According to Brhad-Visdu quoted by Pr, Prakarana p. 13% this penance requires that one should take only three mouthfuls of sacrificial food every day for a month 300 

ERABHAKTA-According to Pr Pr. (folio 488) If one takes for a month only one meal a day it is ekablaktaka.303 

KRCCHRA-This is the general word for several penances The Sāma. Br ( 2 1) starts 302 by saying 'we shall now expound three krcchras' and adds that one should eat sacrificial food for three days only by day add oat nothing at night, then for three days more one should eat at night only, then for three more days one should not beg or ask for food from others and should then observe a complete fast for three days If lie is in a hurry to purify himself he should pass the day standing and the night in a sitting posture. Gaut. (26.2–16) describes the procedure of the first Kr̥cchra (called Prājāpatya by later writers), then Atikrochra (26 18-19), and then Krcchrātıkrcohra ( 26 20 ). Baud. Dh. S (II.1,91 ) speaks of Parāka as Kr̥cchra. Āp. Dh S (19.27.7) describes the Kr̥cchra penance of twelve days. The Kr̥cchra penance described by Gaut, 26 2-16 is one for twelvo days and is called Prājāpatya by Manu (XI 211 ), Saṅkha (183), Yā) III 319 and others. Laugāksi Gr. (5 3-11) describes Kr̥cchra According to the Par 303 M. (II Part 1 p. 30) and Pr, Pr, (fo)10 64a) the word Krcohra without any qualifying epithet (upapada) means Prājāpatya The Pr, T. (p 481 ) states that the Kr̥cchra described by Gaut. (261-5) is given the name of Prājāpatya by Manu (X1. 211). Besides the rules about the intake of food, Gaut. prescribes certain other obsors ances viz speaking the truth, not holding conversation with

men and women that are anāı yas (not of the three higher castes ), always singing the sūmans called 'Raurava' and 'Yaudhājapa', bathing thrice in the day in the morning, the noon and the night, then performing mārjana 301 ( sprinkling of of water) with the three verses beginning with ' Āpo hi stba' (Rg X,9.1-3), vith the mantras called 'pavitravati' viz. those beginning with 'paramānah suvarjanaḥ' (Tai. Br. 1 481) and the eight yerses beginning with 'Hiranyavarpāh' (in Tai, S V. 6.1), he should perform tarpina with water with 13 mantras (Gaut 26,12 ); he performs the worship of Aditya (the sun) with the same mantra (i.e, after tar pana vith the 13 mantras, he is to perform the worship of the sun with the same thirteen mantras ) and offers oblations of clarified butter with the same 13 mantras and then on the 13th day he cooks boiled rice and offers oblations into ordinary Agni ('svābā' added at the end of each, such as ' agnaye svaha), Soma, Agni and Soma, Indra and Agni, Indra, Viśve devāh, Brahman, Prajāpati and Agni Svistakrt and then feeds the brābmanas. 

Krcobra-samvatsara-āp. Dh. S. I 9.27.8 spaaks of this as a penance in which Kr̥cchras are undergone continuously in a cycle for one year. 

Krcchrātikrochra-Gaut, 26,20 and Sāma. Br. I. 2. 8, Vas, 24 3 define it as a krcchra where only water is drunk on those days on which food is allowed and Gaut. 26.23 and Sama. Br. 1 2 9 state that this penance freos a man from all sins, 305 Yaj. II, 320 ( = Dorala 86, first half) and Brabınapurāna g. by Pr, Pr. (folio 40 a) presoribe that in this one has to subsist on water alone for 21 days. This difference between the views of Yaj on the one hand and of Gaut, on the other is reconciled by the digests by saying that the pariod depends on the capacity of the sinner. According to Pr. Pr (folio 46b) and Aparārka p. 1238, Yama prescribed a krochrātikrcchra for 24 days, 306 Vide Par, 

304. For mārjana vide H. of Dh. vol. II pp 317, 8121 and for tarpana the same vol pp. 668-9, 689-695. Raarava Sāmad is sung on the rk 'pudādah soma dbāraya' (Rg IX. 107.4-Samaveda Nos. 511 and 675) and Yaudhājapa on 'Dubīna ūdhar' (Rg. IX. 107.5=Sāmaveda No. 676).

(Vol, 

M. II part 1 p. 179 and Madanapārijāta p. 716. According to Manu XI 208 ( = Viṣṇu Dh. S. 54.30 ) when a person strikes & brāhmana with & weapon and draws blood, he has to undergo this penance. The Pr. Prakarana (p 15 ) states that for those unable to undergo Kr̥cchra, one milch cow is a substitute, for Atikrochra two milch cows and for Krcchrātikrochra four. 

GOMūTRA-KRCCHRA-The Pr. Sāra p. 187 quotes a verse about this: one should make a cow eat to satiety grains of wheat mixed with barley and then may collect the yava" grains that are to be found in her dung and then drink the gruel of those yavas cooked in cow's urine. 307 

GOVRATA Pr, Prakarana (p. 132 ) quoting the Mārkandeya describes this as follows: One should bathe with cow's urine, should subsist on cow-dung, should always stand among cows, should sit down on cowdung, should drink water only when cows have drunk water; one should not eat when they have not eaten, should stand up when they stand, should sit down when they sit down. This should be continued for a month, 

CANDRAYAN 4-The word is derived in this way That rite, where there is action by means of inorease and decrease (10 the intake of food) in imitation of the courge of the phases of the moon, is cāndrāyana 308 The word occurs in Pān. V. 1. 72 (pārāyana-turāyana-cāndrāyanam vartayati) From very ancient times Cāndrāyana has been divided into two varioties, called Yavamadhya 309 (lit. being large in the middle like & grain of yava, and therefore tapering or thin at the ends) and Pipilikāmadhya (lit. baving a middle like that of an ant, that is, slender in the middle and large at the ends), Baud Dh S. II. 8. 33 names these two varieties. According to Jabāli 310 there are five

varieties of Cāndrāyana viz. Yavamadhya, Pipilikāmadhya, Yatıcāndrāyana, Sarvatomukha and stśucāndrāyana. These will be described later on. Yājñavalkya says (III. 326 ) that where no specific penance is prescribed in the smrti texts, cāndrāyana effects purification and cāndrāyana may be undergone not as a penance but for the purpose of accumu lating merit and that in the latter case (when performed for a year) the performer enjoys the happiness of going to the world of the moon after death. 311 Manu XL 221 and Gaut. 27.18 state the same view about cāndrāyana for accumulating merit. When the vrata of cāndrāyana is performed for the sake of merit, there is no tonsure (vide Gaut, 27.3 'vapanam vratan caret' and Haradatta thereon). Gaut. 19.20 (= Vas. 22. 20) prescribes that Kr̥cchra, Atikrochra and Candrāyana are the same ponance for all sins ( collectively for grave sins, for lesser ones separately, according to Haradatta and others). Compare Manu V 21 and XI, 215 (=Baud. Dh S. IV.5, 16). Manu XI, 27, Ya]. ILL. 323, Vas, 27 21, Baud. Dh, S. IV.5.18 and others define Cāndrāyana (of the Yayamadhya type) as follows: On the first day of the bright half of a month only one morsel of food (grāsa or pinda) is taken, on the second irthi two and so on; on the full moon (Paurnamāsī) 15 morsels are taken; then on the first of the dark half 14 morsels, one being reduced on each succeeding day. So on the 14th of the dark half only one morsel is taten and on the Amāvāsyā there is a complete fast. Here in the middle of the month of thirty days the largest number of morsels is taken (and so this is Yayamadhya) just as on the Paurnamāsi day the moon becomes full and begins to wane from the next day. Here Paurnamāsi is in the middle of the period of the observance as Viṣṇu Dh. S. 47.6 says. If one begins the vrata on the first toth, of the dark half, he reducas one morse) on the 1st i. e. takes 14 morsels on that day, 13 on the 2nd tithi of the dark half and so on On the 14th of the dark half he eats one morsel and on the amāvāsyā he eats nothing. Then on the 1st of the bright half he takes one morsel and goes on increasing the intake till on the Paurnamāst he takes 15 morsels The month is taken in this latter casa to be Pūrnimānta. Here in the middle of the observance there is no food taken and a large number of morsels is taken at the beginning and at the end So this is called Pipīlikāmadhya. This latter is dascribad by Vas 23.45

Voi, 

and Manu XI. 216. Vispu Dh, S. 47,5-6 say: Yasyāmamāvāsya madhye bhavati sa pipiliki-madhyah yasya paurnamāsi sa yavamadhyah. If there are 14 or 16 tithis in any particular pakṣa (half of a month ) thon the number of grūsas must be regulated accordingly There are other descriptions of cindrāyapa Vide Haradatta on Gaut. 27.12–15. The Kalpataru appears to have held (explaining two verses of Jābā]8) that on the first of the dark half of a month 15 morsels were taken, then one morsel less was taken on each succeeding tithi; so that on amāvāsyā one morse) was eaton, then on the first of the bright half two morsels were eaten and one morsel was added every day so that on the 14th of the bright half fifteen morsels were taken and there was a complete fast on Paurbamāsi. But this seems to be opposed to the very idea of increase and decrease of the intake of food on the analogy of the waxing and waning of the Moon and to several smrti texts such as Vas 23.45 and Parāsara X 2 Thorofore the Pr. Prakāśa (folio 58b) finds fault with it 31166 Cāndrāyana may be divided from another point of view into two varieties : (1) MUKHYA (in the primary sense, viz. following exactly the waxing and waning of the moon) and GAUNA (having a secondary or metaphorical senso). The former is either yavamadhya or pipillu-kanil madhya ), while the latter is of four kinds, viz. sāmānya, rsi cāndrāyana, śiśucāndrāyana and yaticandrayana The last two will be described later, The Samanya (or sarvatomukha ) consists in eating only 240 morsels of sacrificial food in a month of 30 days, distributing them according to one's choice (not necessarily in imitation of the phases of the moon) as stated by Manu XI 220, Baud. IV.5.21, Yāy III, 324 and the Mit (on Yā). II. 324), the Madana-pārijāta and other works. Here the penance, though it is not regulated by the phases of the moon, is called Candrāyana for the purpose of prescribing the same procedure and observances in it as in the Candrāyana which follows the phases of the inoon. Here the Mimānsā rule of Kundapāyinām-ayana applies. 322 From th 3 words of Gautama

27.12-15 it appears that he envisaged a cāndrāyana of 32 days ( pipllikamadhya ) or 31 days, when he says that the performer siould fast on the 14th of the bright half, eat fifteen morsels on the Full Moon day, then reduce it by one morsel, so that there is a total fast on the amārāsya and then on the first of the bright half one morsel is taken until on the full moon 15 morsels are taken. Thus from the 14th of the bright half (when fiere is a complete fast) to the full moon of the succeeding month there are in all 32 days and the penance is of the pipilikā-madhya type. 

As regards the size of the morsels, different views are Espressed. Gaat 27.10 and Vispu Dh, S. 47.2 prescribe that the size of a morsel shall be such as not to cause a distortion of the mouth (while swallowing it) Yaj TIL 323 allows that the morsels may be as large as the egg of a peahen, and Parāśara X,3313 prescribes the size of a hen's egg and Saṅkba that of an undried amalala fruit ( myrobalan). The Mit explains that Gautama's Fords apply to boys and young people and that the other sizes confer an option according to the capacity (sakti) of the man undergoing pedance. The procedure of candrāyana is described in Gaut, 27.2-11, Baud. III.8, Manu X1221-225, Vrddha-gautana chap. 16 and other works. The one given by Gautama, being pro bably the oldest among Dharmaśāstra works, is hera set out. 

The general rules prescribed for the Kyochra penance in Gaut. 266-11 are applicable to Candrāyada also. If it is parformed as a penance the performer must tongure his hair and observe a fast on the day preceding the Full Moon. He offers libations of water, oblations of clarified butter, consecrates the sacrificial food and worships the moon, reciting 'āpyāyasva!, (Rg I 91.17), 'san te payāmsi' (Rg. I 91. 18). He shall offer clarified butter, reciting the four (rks) beginning with 'yad dara devahedanem' (Vaj. S. 20.14 or Tai. Br. I. 6.6.1). These

four together with the preceding are seren oblations of clarified butter that have to be offered. At the end of the offering of clarified butter he shall offer pieces of sacred fuel while reciting the (eight) texts beginning rith 'derabrtasya' (Vāj S VII 13). Each mouthfuj must be consecrated by (mentalls ) reciting one of the 314 following words 'om bhūḥ, bhurah, syah, tapah iruth, fame, prosperity, rigour, refreshment, strength, lustre, lyrightness, soul, dharma and sira' 315; or he may consecrate all of them at once saying 'adoration' stāhā'. The sacrificial food must be one of the folloring. boiled rice, food obtained by begging, ground barley, grain separated from the husk, barley gruel, vegetables, milk, sour milk, clarified butter, roots, fruits and water. Among these each succeeding one is preferable to that edumerated earlier.

TAPTAKRCCHR4-There is great divergence of views about this penance Manu XI 214, Vas 21 21, Vispu Dh. S 46 11, Baud Dr. S. IV 5.10, Saṅkle-smrti 18.4, Agniparāda 171 6-7, Atri verses 122–123, Parāsara IV. 7 speak of it as of 12 days' duration comprising four periods of three days each In this one drinks hot rater, hot milk, hot ghee for three days each and then for three days there is a complete fast rhen he inhales hot Tapour or atmosphere (ace to Bladu XI. 214) Manu adds that the performer has to bathe only once (and not thrice as in some other penances) and that he should practise self-control Tāj II 317 (= Devala 84) speaks of this as of four days' duration, viz he takes hot milk, hot ghee and hot Tater for one day each and observes a total fast on the 4th day. The Mit on Yāj. ITL 317 calls this mahātapia-bocchra and also mentions a lapak cchra of two days, vix on the first day the sidner takes ..:+trze, vir hot rater. los milk ard hot ghee and obscTTE a total fast on the 2nd day.

The penance Tæptakrochra 

of by the Mit has to be found out The Pr. Prakāśa refers to a tapta-krochra for 21 days. It may be said, as done by the Pr. Prakāśa, that the penance of tapta-krochra for twelve days is meant for great sins and that the one for four days is meant for lesser sins The quantity of water, miśk and ghee, that was to be taken is laid down by Parāśara 316 IV. 8, Atri 123-124 and Brahmapurāna (q. by Pr V. p. 513) viz. that hot water, hot milk and hot ghee should be six palas, three palas and one pala respectively The Brahmapurāna adds that water, milk and ghee are to be taken respectively in the evening, morning and noon 

TULĀPURUSA KRCCHRA-Jābāli speaks 317 of the duration of this penance as eight days; Saṅkha (18,9-10) and Viṣṇu Dh. S. 46 22 describe one of ten days where oil-cake, the foamy scum of cooked rice, butter-milk, water and barley meal are to be sater, each respectively ou one day, followed by a fast on the next day Yā). III, 32% (= Atri versos 129-130) describes one of 15 days where the above five ingredients are eaten for three days each. Yama on the other hand speaks of Tulāpurusa for 21 days, when the five things are separately saten for three days (vide Mit, on Yāj II. 322). Aparārka pp. 1239—1241, Par. M II. part % pp 184-189, Madanapārijāta pp. 718–727, Pr. Sāra pp 179–181 set out at length the mode of the performance of Tulāpurusa as a penance.

TOYA-K.RCCHRA-This is also called Varuna-krochra by Yama (q in Pr. Prakāśa, folio 48 a) and by Saṅkha (q in Pr. Sāra p. 182). Viṣṇu Dh S. (46. 14) states 318 that subsisting on nothing but ground barley mixed with water for one month is called Udakaktcchu a. Since Varupa was regarded as the lord of waters even from the times of the Rgveda (e. g. in Rg. VII. 49. 3) and to mark the truth and falsehood among men, this Toya krochra was called Varuna. The Pr. Prakasa (folio 47 b)319 quotes Jābāla to the effect 'If a sinner remains immersed in water for a whole day and night without taking food and recites mantras (addressed to Varupa) he removes by the jalalcrcchra the sing which he may have committed for a year'. According to Yājña valkya (q in Pr. Sara p 187) this penance consists in observing a fast for a day and night standing up the whole day and passing the night without sleep in water and reciting the next day the sacred Gāyatri mantra 1008 times. According to Saṅkha (g. by Madana-pārijāta p 737) this penance is constituted either by subsisting on lotus stalks giown in water or on saktus boiled in water. 

DADHIKROCHRA-This is spoken of by the Pr Prakasa quoting from the Viṣṇudharmottarapurāna as a pedance in which the sinner subsists on ourds alone for a month.320

Penance called Devahrcchira of only rice gruel, barley gruel, vegetables, milk, curds, ghee each for a period of three days in succession and then should observe a complete fast for three days; this is called Devaksta (performed by the gods) penance and destroys all sins. It was practised by the Maruts, the Vasus, Rudras, and Adityas. By the power of this ponance they became free from rajas (impurity). Thus this penance lasts for 21 days. The Pr. Prakāśa (folio 48 b) refers to apother variety of it and quotes a long prose passage on it, which is passed over here for pant of space. 

DHANADAKRCCHRA-See under Vayayya-krochra. According to the Visaudharmottara 322 (q. by Pi. Prakāśa) this penance consists in subsisting for a month on food just sufficient to fill the extended but hollowed palm, mixed with gold (i. e, in which gold is rubbed or boiled). 

NITYOPAVASA KROCHRA-The Pr. Prakāśa (p. 48 a) states that this is constituted by a man eating only twice in the day (in the morning and evening ) for six years and not drink ing even water between the two meals. 323 

PANCAGAVYA -For the various details connected with panicagavya prepared from cow's urine, dung, milk, cards and ghee, vide H, of Dh, vol. II, pp. 773-774, Pancagavya is to be offered into fire with the mantras 'Irāyati' (Rg. VI, 99,3), 'idami Viṣṇur' (Rg 1.22. 17), 'mā nastoke' (Rg. I. 114.8), "Sam po deyir' (Rg. X 9.4) and then the remainder is to be drunk. It is to be drunk with the middle of a sprig of three Palāśa leaves or with a lotus leaf. Manu, XI, 165 ( = Agnipurāna 169, 30) prescribes this drinking of pañcagavya as the penance for petty thefts Similarly, Yāj. II. 263 prescribes that one guilty of killing a cow should drink panicagavya for a month. The Mit. on Yāj. III. 263 quotes Viṣṇu to the effect that one who kills a cow should perform one of three penances, yiz, drinking three palas of pañcagavya every day for one month or undergoing the penance of Parāka or Candrāyana, 324 Though Vispu 54, 4 and Atri (verse 300 ) state that a brālimapa

Parāśara XI 3 and 27 and medieval works like the Pr M. (p 13) and Sūdrakamalakara (p. 42) allowed śūdras to take pañcagavya without Vedic mantı as. And women of all vardas, being treated like sūdras for certain purposes, were also allowed optionally to do the same, 

PATRAKRCCHRA-Vide Parna-kūrca below, 

PARAKA-Manu XI, 215 (= Baud. Dh S IV. 5.16), Yāj. III. 320 (= Saṅkha 18 5 = Atri 128), Agnipurāva 171, 10, Viṣṇu Dh, S. 46. 18 and Br. 325 prescribe that this penance is constituted by not taking any food for twelve days, while the performer controls his senses and remains vigilant, and that this penance removes all sins. 

PARNAKŪRCA-This is a more severe type of patra krcchra Yā) II 316 (= Devala 83) and Saṅkha-Likbita 326 define Parnakrochra as one where the leaves of palāśa, udumbara, lotus, and bilva are boiled separately on each day in succession and the decoction of each is drunk on each day separately and then water in which kuśas have been dipped is drunk. Thus parpakrcchra is a penance of five days The Mit. on Yāj. III. 316 quotes a verse of Yama to the effect that when a sinner fasts for three days and nights and thereafter he drinks together the decoctions of all the four and Icusa water on the same day then the penance is called parnakūrca. The Par M (II part 2 p 181)327 regards Parnakūrca as a variety of Parna krcolira Vasistha, Jābāli and Atri (116–117) make Parna kicchra a penance of six days by adding the leaves of Aśvattha to the five mentioned above, Viṣṇu Dh S 46 23 mentions another variety of Parpakrcchra for seven days 328

PADAKRCCERA-According to Yaj. III. 318(=Dovala 85) this is defined as a penance where a sinner takes food one day only once by day, only once by night, then once only by day or night) but without asking for it from any one (a stranger, a servant or even his own wife) and observes a total fast for one day. Thus this penance lasts for four days. There was differ ence of view as to the number of mouthfuls to be eaten, Apastamba (a by Mit, on Yāj, II, 318) saying that the mouth fuls are respectively 22, 26 and 24 when food is taken only once in the evening or morning or without asking for it, while Parāśara states the number of mouthfuls to be 12, 15 or 24 respectively when food is taken only at night or in the morning or without asking for it The Caturvimsatimata (q. by Par. M. II part 2 p. 172) puts them as 12, 15 and 10 respectively 

PADONAKRCCHRA-This lasts for nine days 329 only instead of the 12 days of the Prājāpatya and in it one eats by day only for three days, eats food once only for taree days with out asking for it from any one and observes a complete fast for three days (i. e, three days when food is eaten by night only are omitted here). 

PUSPARRCCHRA-According to the Agnipurāna 171. 12 and the Mit, on Yāj II. 316 (quoting Markandeyapurāna) this penance is constituted by drinking for a month the decoction of flowers boiled in water. 330

Some passages from Baud who is probably the oldest of the three authors may be set out here, 331 "Now if a man feels his conscience heavy with bad actions committed by himself, let him boil for himself, when the stars have risen, a liandful of barley and prepare gruel with that. Let him not perform (the Vaisvadeva) offering with (a part of) that nor a Balh 332 offering. Let him consecrate the barley before it has been placed on fire, when it is being boiled and after it has been boiled with the following mantras 'thou art barley, the king of grains, thou art sacred to Varuna and mixed with honey, the sages have declared thee to be an expeller of all sins and a means of purification' Then there are five verses more invoking the barley grains to purify the performer from all sins whether due to deeds, words, or thoughts, to destroy distress and evil fortune, to free him from the food of ganas (guilds or multitudes of men), hariots, Sudras, or food offered at sraddhas by persons in impurity due to birth or death, food of a thief, food at navaśrāddha (i e on 1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th, 11th days after death) or from dreadful mortal sins or from guilt against children and guilt due to serving in a royal court, from sin of stealing gold, sin of the violation of a viata or sacrificing for an unworthy person and sin of speaking 1]] of brāhmanas Then Baud proceeds "while the barley is being boiled he should guard it and recite 'Adoration to Rudra, lord of created beings; pacified

Let him offer it as a sacrifice to the soul reciting 'ye deva' (Tai.

Then Baud. prescribes: "one desirous of wisdom must perform this rite for three days and nights A sinner who drinks it during six days becomes pure, he who drinks this during seven days becomes purified from the wahāpātakas, he who driuks during eleven days removes even the sins conmitted by his ancestors. But he wybo during 21 days drinks gruel of barley grains which have passed through a cow (i. e. cowdung) sees the Ganas, the lord of the Ganas, the goddess of learning and the lord of learning." 

PRAJAPATYA-Vide under Kr̥cchra above where it is shown that the word Kr̥cchra without any qualifying epithet means Prājāpatya. Manu XI. 211, Yaj III, 319, Viṣṇu Dh. S. 46 10, Atri 119–120, Saṅkha 18 3, Baud Dh. S. IV 5 6 mention the word Prājāpatya and define it. This Prājāpatya bas several 'varieties. The first is that described by Manu XI, 211 and Vas, 21, 20 viz. four periods of three days each following one another in which there is respectively eating once only by day, once only by night, eating once only without asking for it and complete fast. The second is that described by Vas. 23. 43, where on the first day food is taken only by day, on the 2nd only at night, on the 3rd day food got without asking for it is taken and on the 4th a complete fast is observed and where the same process is repeated for two periods of four days each The first 333 is called Prājāpatya by 'sthānaviyrddhi' and the 2nd is called 'Dandakalita'. Further, both these are said to be made ānulomyeza' (by the proper and straightforward order). If the sequence described above is reversed i, e if for three days there is first a total fast, then subsisting for 3 days on food got without asking for it, then for three days eating at night only

BRHAD-YAVAKA-The Pr. Pr. (folio 49 a) quoting Brahmapurāna describes it as follows. One should feed cows on plenty of yavas anointed with clarified butter Then he should mix water with the dung of those cows and take out the grains of barley which are voided by thein after eating them He should then dry them in the sun, should grind them on a clean stone and cook them mixed with sesame and anointed with ghee in cow's urine on a fire brought on an altar He should place the boiled holy grains in a vessel of gold or in a cup made of palāśa leaves and present them to the gods and manes and he may eat them. He should carry this on for twelve, twenty-four or thirty-six years for the removal of all sins. This is prescribed as a penance for killing one's guirre, brother, friend or a near relative &c. 

BRAHMAKŪRCA-The Mit 335 on Yājñava]kya II 314 states that when a man fasts on one day and on the next day mixes up the ingredients of pañcagavya with Vedic mantras and drinks it with mantras it is called Brahmakūrca. According to Saṅkha cow's urine is taken with the Gayatri (Rg. IL. 62 10 ), cowdung with the mantra 'Gandhadyārām' (Tai.

• pp 969-972 quoting Devala and Mārkandeyapurāna, in which a vwāha or a half of it or quarter of it had to be donated.

For killing a brāhmada secretly or for the guilt of incest one had to perform ten thousand or 40 thousand suvarda-krochras and a lesser number for various other lapses. 

SOMAYANA–According to the Madanapārijāta pp. 744 746 (quoting Hārītadharmasūtra and Mārkandeya) and Pr Prakasa (folio 60b) the penance lasts for thirty days divided into five periods of 7,7,7,6, 3 days, in which the milk of all the four udders of a cow, of three udders, of two udders and of one udder is respectively drunk and for the last three days there is a complete fast.
