  <p>CHAPTER I</p>
<p>The Article on sin in Hasting&rsquo;s Encyclopædia of Religion and Ethics (Vol 11) will clearly show how the idea of sin varies from religion to religion, from age to age and from coun try to country. We are concerned here with the growth and development of the doctrine of sin in India from Vedic times to the medieval digests and commentaries on Dharmaśāstra</p>
<p>Sin (pātaku) is a word that belongs to the terminology of religion rather than to that of Ethics 1 It is very difficult to dafine sin. In a general way it may be said that it is an act which is regarded as a wilful rebellion against or disobedience of some law supposed to be laid down by God or Revelation; it is opposition to the will of God manifested in an authoritative work or at least failure to abide by the regulations contained therein.</p>
<p>1 In these days many people, both in the East and the West, ques. tion the very existence of sio As Barbour puts it in his &lsquo;Sin and the new Psychology&rsquo; ( 19) &ldquo;The feeliag is garding vide acceptaace that there is no such thog as $ıb in the Christian sense. Evil may encompass a man&rsquo;s life and bring disaster to his personality, but it is not so It is psychic evsi that can be explained by psychic causes and perhaps cured by psycho logical therapy and Many say &lsquo;nothing is right and nothing is wrong Every thing is the result of complexes. It has resulted in an easy tolerance of sia&rdquo; Sir Oliver Lodge in his article on Christian Doctrine&rsquo; in the Hibbert Journal for 1903-4 at p 466 says &lsquo;The higher mad of to-day is not worrying about bis sins at all, still less about their punishments His mission, if he is good for anything, is to be up and doing and in so far as he acts wroagły or unwisely he expects to suffer&rsquo; The followers of Cār vāka who was the prince of Atheists in ancient India used to say &lsquo;man should live among pleasures as long as life lasts, he should feed himself sumptu ously (lit, skould drink ghee) even by borrowing money from others There is ao coming again joto the world after the body is reduced to asbes by cremation&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Hưstory of Dharmaśāstra</p>
<p>[Vol</p>
<p>The Rgveda is full of fervent and heart-felt expressions of tlıe sense of sin and betrays intense desire on the part of the sages of old to be free from it The idea of sin in the Rgveda is bound up with the conception of rta. The conception of rta cannot be discussed here in detail But a brief statement is absolutely necessary in order to be able to convey what the Vedic doctrine of sin was 2</p>

<p>Many of the principal gods of the Vedic pantheon are described as the guardians, promoters or charioteers of rta, Mitra and Varuna rule over all the world by rka (Rg V, 637, rtena visvain bhuvanam vi rājathah); Matra and Varupa, the protectors of rta, occupy a chariot (Rg V. 631), Mitra, Varuna, and Aryaman are said to be charioteers of rta (yūyamrtasya rathyah, VII 66 12); they and Aditi and Bhaga are protectors of rta (Rg. VI 51 3) Agni is called &lsquo;the charioteer of ļta&rsquo; (rathi rtasya, Rg. III, 28), the protector of pta, in Rg. 1.18, III 10.2, 4.8.5, X 118.7 and itāvān (in Rg IV.2.1). Soma is styled the protector of rta (in Rig. IX. 48 4, IX 738) and is said to support rta (IX, 97.24 ptam bharat subhrtam carvindub) In Rg. VI. 66.13 the Adityas are said to be rlaran (acting according to the fixed order of nature), tlagāta (sprung from rta) and Itāvrdh (augmenting or rejoicing in rta) and further they are said to be fierce baters of anyta (what is opposed to Ita).&rsquo;</p>
<p>Rta is distinguished from sacrifice (yajña). It is not any particular sacrificial rite itself nor the institution of sacrifice, It stands for the ordered course of sacrifice in general In Rg. IV, 3.4. Agni is styled racit (conversant with or observing sta) and is invoked to know the rta (of the sacrifice); in several Fersos we meet with the words &lsquo;utena ṣtam&rsquo; (e. g. in Rg IV. 3.9 rtena Itam niyatam-illa ā goh&rsquo;, V, 15.2 &lsquo;stena ṣtama dharunam dhārayanta yajñasya sāke, V. 68.4 rtam-stena sapantā &ldquo;conform ing to or joining rta with rta&rsquo;, where &ldquo;tena&rsquo; appears to mean the correct course of sacrificial rites and &lsquo;rtam&rsquo; the settled order in the universe.

<p>The conception of rta as a moral imperative occurs in several passages Rg 1. 90 6 (madhu vātā rtāpate madhu ksarantı sındhavah) &lsquo;the winds carry sweets, the rivers do the same to him who keeps rta&rsquo;, Rg V 12 % &lsquo;O Agni, that knowest rta, know rta alone (in me) I shall not resort to magic either by force or hy duplicity, I shall conform to rta of the reddish bull (1 m of Agni)s; Rg.

<p>In two or three instances sta appears to be almost personifi ed and invoked as a divinity. &lsquo;O Agnil for us offer sacrifice to Mitra and Varuna, to the gods and to the great (brhat) rta&rsquo; (Rg I 75 5).

IX 113,4 rta and satya both occur and appear to mean almost the same thing In Rg X. 190 1 Ita and satya are distinguished as having sprung from &lsquo;tapas&rsquo;. Rta involves a wider conception and satya had originally a restricted mean ing (viz truth or static order). The word aprta, however, is the</p>

Gradually, however, the word rta receded into the back-ground and satya took its place even in Vedic literature, though here and there (as in Tai, Up, II 1 and 1.9.3) both sta and satya ara found in juxtaposition.</p>
<p>The sages of the Rgveda vere acutely conscious of sin or guilt and pray to the gods, particularly to Varuna and the Adityas, for forgiveness and for being freed from the consequ ences of sin In this connection they employ numerous words such as āgas, enas, agha, durita, dushrla, drugdha, amhas. A few examples of the employment of these words may be cited here. The most frequent vords are āgas and enas, both of whiclı appear to import sin in its deepest and most ethical sense. Rg. VII 86 is a hymn to Varuna in which there are several verses that breathe a deep and heart-felt consciousness of guilt. The sage begins in verse 3 by saying that all wise men of whom ho inquired told him the same thing viz. &lsquo;Varuna is angry with you. Then the sage proceeds &lsquo;O Varupal what is that great guilt (āgas) (of mine) whereby you desire to injure your worship per and a friend ? Declare that to me, then I shall quickly approach thee with an obeisance and be free from sin (enas). Cast away from us the transgressions (drugdha) of our father and those that we committed in our own person ;&hellip;free Vasistha (from guilt) like a calf from the rope (that binds zt). In Rg. VII, 89,5 (almost equal to Atharya-veda VI, 51,3) the sage says &lsquo;whatever transgressions (abhidroha) we who are mere men have practised as against the divine hosts and whatever dhar mas laid down by you we may have confounded through our ignorance (or heedlessness) do not destroy us ou account of that guilt (enas).&rsquo; It will be noticed that in these verses the words agas, ablude oha and enus are employed in the same verses and therefore practi cally inean the same thing. In Rg. II. 27.14 the sage prays &lsquo;O Aditil O Mitral O Varunal take pity on us though we may have committed some sin against you&rsquo;, In Rg. II, 28 5 Varuna is implored to loosen sin (agas) from the devotee just like a girdle, Rg. VIII, 45,34 states: &lsquo;O Indral do not kill us for one sin, for two sins or three sins or for many (āgas).&rsquo; In Rg 11, 29.1 the Adityas are implored &lsquo;cast away from me sın (āgas) as a woman who gives birth to a child in secret&rsquo;.

<p>Another word is amhas. The following passages may bo cited. In Rg II. 28 6 Varupa is implored &lsquo;remove ainhas (sin ) as one removes the rope from the (neck) of the calf; one has not the power even to wink without you (your favour)&rsquo;? It should be noted that in the preceding verse (D 28 5) already quoted the simile of the girdle is employed with regard to ūgas. &lsquo;May Indra take us away from anhas as persons on both sides ( of a river) call one who is going in a boat&rsquo; (Rg II, 32 14 ), &lsquo;No evil caused by the gods or by ren reaches him from any side who Vorships Agai with fuel, oblation or sacrifice&rsquo;&rsquo; Rg VIIL 19, 6, &lsquo;May Aditi, the mother of the affluent Mitra and Varuna, save us from all sın&rsquo; (Rg.

Here all three words &lsquo;durita, droha and anrta&rsquo; are brought together and convey almost the same idea, viz, sin or guilt against the law of the Gods. In Rg I. 185 10 Heaven and Earth are called father and mother and are invoked to save the worshipper from dunta (sin) which involves blame (pātām-avadyād-duritad) &lsquo;Avadya&rsquo; means &lsquo;garhya&rsquo; acc. to Pān.

<p>How sin arises in men&rsquo;s minds</p>
<p>than these and He makes that man commit bad deeds whom Ho wishes to drag down'.18 Here it appears to be suggested that some men are chosen by God for being saved and some are chosen for being damned. This sounds like the Calvinistic doctrine of pre-destination. In the Bhagavadgita (LII, 36 ) Arjuna questions Srikrsna as follows: &lsquo;impelled by whom does a man commit sin as if constrained thereto by force, even though he does not desire to do so&rsquo;? The answer given is (III. 37) “it is lust and anger springing from the element (muna) of rajas (passion) that are the enemies of man in this world. In another place the Bhagavadgitā (XVI. 21 ) says &lsquo;this19 is the three-fold door or entrance to Hell that is ruinous to the self viz, lust, anger and greed; therefore a man must shun these three.&rsquo; But it must be said that this does not go to the real root of the matter. The question is why should carnal lust, anger or greed themselves arise in the mind of man. The only answer that is indicated is in accordance with the tenets of the Sārkhya philosophy viz. that there are three gunes, sattva, rajas and tamas which combine in various proportions in different men and that it is rajo guna that is the cause of man&rsquo;s sinfulness In the Santi parya, chap. 163, it is stated that there are thirteen very powerful enemies of men beginning with anger (kr odha) and hāma (lust) and it is said that krodha springs from lobha (covet ousness), which latter arises from ignorance (verses 7 and 11). But there is no satisfactory discussion of the origin of ignorance in that chapter. Gautama 19.2 observes20 that &lsquo;man in this Torld is polluted by &amp; vile action such as sacrificing for a man unvorthy to offer a sacrifice, eating forbidden food, speaking that ought not to be spoken, neglecting what is prescribed and practising what is forbidden&rsquo;.

It may be noticed that most of these occur almost in the same order in Ap. Dh. S, I. 5. 12. 22 where it is24 said that though</p>

The Amarakośa explains Free differently. (17, 43-44) makes even the father or other guardian for marriage getting a younger son or daughter married before an elder one and the priest officiating at such a marriage equally guilty fralara: orta ar यया च परिविद्यते । व्रतं संवत्सरं कुर्युतियाजकपञ्चमा.</p>
<p>Vol.</p>
<p>these actions are not to be styled patanīyas according to Ap, yet they cause impurity which being greater and greater in each succeeding one requires higher and higher penances. Āv adds a few more sinners to those in the Tai, Brviz drdmṣupalı (husband of an older sister whose younger sister was married before her), paryāhita (an elder brother before whom a younger brother kindled fires ), pariunvidana (a younger brother who takes his share of the ancestral property before his elder brother ), parunna ( an older brother before whom a younger brother takes away his share of the ancestral property). The Obāndogya Upanisad25 (V. 10. 9.) quotes a verse that declares that the five great sinners are the thief of gold, the drinker of surū, the violator of the guru&rsquo;s bed, the murderer of a brahmapa, and one who associates with any of the preceding four. The Br. Up. (IV. 3. 22) mentions as great sinners the thief and the murderer of a bhruna.</p>
<p>Coming to the sūtras there is great divergence as to the classification of sins and the enumeration of sins in each class. The Āp. Dh. S, divides sins into two classes viz. pataniya (those that cause loss of caste), asuahara (those that cause imprurity. though no loss of caste is caused). Āp. Dh. S (I.7.21,7-11) states that palaniya sins are theft (of gold), crimes whereby one becomes an ablusasta, complete loss (by neglect) of the Vedic learning that one secured by study, destruction of a foetus, incestuous connection with relations born of the same womb as one&rsquo;s father or mother and with the children of such persons, drinking of sura, intercourse with persons with whom intercourse is for bidden, intercourse with the female friend of one&rsquo;s female guru (mother &amp;c) or with the female friend of one&rsquo;s guru (father &amp;c.) and with the wife of any stranger, constant commission of immoral acts (adhar ma) other than those already mentioned. Ap. Dh $. I. 7.21.10 notes that, according to some, intercourse with a woman who is not the wife of a guru is not a pataniya sin. Among acts which render a man impure are (Ap. Dh, S, I, 7. 21. 12–18) the cohabitation of an Arya woman with sūdras, eating the flesh of forbidden animals such as that of a dog or a human being or village cock or pig or other carnivorous animals, eating the excrement of human beings, partaking of food Jeft by a sūdra, and cohabitation by Arya men with apapātra</p>

<p>women.25 According to some, those acts that are declared to be asuakara are also pataniyas. Āp. Dh, S. (I. 7.21.19) states that acts other than those enumerated are a]so asucikara. Āp. Dh, S. (1. 9. 24.6-9) enumerates those who are ablurśasta, viz, one who slays a person belonging to the first two yarṇas (viz, brāhmana and ksatriya) who had studied the Veda or who had been initiated for the performance of a sona sacrifice, one who kills a mare brāhmana (though he may not have studied the Veda or be not initiated for a soma sacrifice), also one who destroys the embryo of a brāhmana even though its sex be undisting uishable, or slays a woman who is an alreyi (in her monthly course). The Vasisthadharmasutra divides 27 sinners into three classes, viz. those who are enasuns, those guilty of mabāpātakas and those guilty of upapatakas (I. 19-23). Among those who are styled enasvinah are those mentioned in Ap. Dh. S. II, 5.12.22, with this difference that the &lsquo;brahmojjha&rsquo;, who is included among &lsquo;pataniyas&rsquo; by Ap. Dh. S, 1.7, 21, 9 is put among &lsquo;enasvins&rsquo; by Vasiṣtha. In Vas. 20.4–12 special prāyaścittas for each of these &lsquo;enasvinah&rsquo; (ordinary sinners) are prescribed. The Mahāpātakas (mortal sids) according to Vasistha are five, viz (violating) a guru&rsquo;s bed, drinking of spirituous liquor, murder of a bhrūna (a learned brahmana), stealing gold from a brāhmaṇa and associating with a patta. Those guilty of upapātakas (minor sins) are: He who forsakes sacred Vedic fires, he who offends a guru, an atheist, he who earns his livelihood from atheists, and he who sells the soma plant. The Baudhāyana Dharmasūtra28 (II, 1) divides sins into pataniya, upapātaka and asucikara. Among the first it cites making voyages by sea, stealing the property of a brāhmaṇa&rsquo;or misappropriating a deposit, giving false evidence</p>

<p>Classification of sins</p>
<p>15</p>
<p>The above statement about the classification of sins and their inclusion among the several classes or &lsquo;grades of sids will show that among the early sūtra works there was no general agreement about the nature and number of mahāpātakas, upapatakas and other classes of sins, even though as early as the Chandogya Upanisad the mortal sins had been declared to be five. It must be supposed that that Upanisadrepresented only one school of thought in the times of Āp., Baud, and Gaut, who did not entirely accept the tradition of that Upanisad, but followed other divergent ideas. It is impossible to suppose that the verse quoted in that Upanisad is later than the Dharma sūtras of Ap., Gaut, Baud, and Vas</p>
<p>posed that thing had been dearly as</p>
<p>ing more to association om also says tha</p>
<p>It appears that Katyāyana32 divided sinful acts into five classes viz. mahāpāpa (mortal sins), atipāpa (the highest sins than which there is nothing worse), pātaha (sins similar to mahā patakas), prāsangka (due to association for contact) and upapātaka (minor sias). The Bhavisya-purāna also says that those sins that are declared to be equal to mahāpatakas (by Manu and others) are called pātakas Vrddha-Hārsta also (IX. 215-216) speaks of five kinds viz, mahāpāpa, pataka, anupātaka, upapāpa and prakırnaka (miscellaneous) and states (IX, 216–218) that those sins which are said to be like mahāpātaka are pātakas, that anupātakas are sins lesser than patakas, that upapatakas are lesser than patakas and prakīnaka sins are the least sinfu) of all. The Visnudharnasūtra (33 3-5)*speaks of nine kinds of lapses viz. atipātaka, mahāpataka, anupataka, upapataka, jātıbhrariisakara (effecting loss of caste), sankarīkarapa, (Tendering one as degraded as a man of a mixed caste), apātri karana (renderiog the perpetrator unworthy of receiving a gift), malāvaha (causing defilement) and prakīrpaka (miscellaneous). Atipatakas, acc. to Visbu Dh, S 34.1, are sexual intercourse with one&rsquo;s mother, daughter or daughter-in-law and the only expiation for them is entering fire. Manu omits the separate mention of atipātaka and anupātaka and includes most of them under those that he designates as equal to one of the fovr well known mahāpātakas. Katyāyana quoted in the Prāyaścitta muktāvali of Divākara (folio 3 a) adds sexual intercourse with one&rsquo;s sister as atipātaka to the three mentioned by Visnu</p>

<p>[Vol.</p>
<p>Harita Dh. S (it appears) quoted by the Mit knew33 of a variety of patakas called anupātaka, but from the way in which the several patakas are arranged it looks as if atıpātaka in Harita was a lesser sin than mahāpātaka Manu (in chap XI) refers to all the kinds of pātakas found in the Visnu-dharmasūtra except atipātakas Usually five mahāpātakas have been enumerated from the days of the Chāndogya Up (quoted on p. 12) viz brābmana murder, drinking spirituous liquor, theft (generally understood as theft of brāhmana&rsquo;s gold), sexual intercourse with the wife of a guru and association with the perpetrators of any of these four (for a year34) Vide Vas I 19-20, Manu XI 55, 180, Yā; TII, 227, 261), Visnudharmsūtra 35 1-5, Vrddha-Hārsta IX 174. Manu mentions certain sins as equal to Mahāpatakas which are styled anupatakas by the Vispudharmasūtra chap. 36 The most elaborate treatment of all kinds of sins in the amrtis is found in Manu, Yāj and Visnu There is difference of opinion even among these three on certain points For example, Manu35 XI. 56 says that forgetting the Veda, reviling the Vedas, giving false evidence, slaying a friend, eating forbidden food and food that is unfit for eating or should not be eaten, are lapses similar to drinking surā; while Yā. IIT, 228 states that three out of these (viz reviling the Vedas, slaying a friend and forgettirg the Veda studied by a person) along with the reviling of a guru by attri buting false faults are similar to the murder of a brālmana. The result is that there is an option as to the expiation to be prescribed for these sins,</p>

<p>Details of Mahāpūlakas</p>
<p>It would be desirable to give some details as regards each of the makāpātakas and then to describe the other varieties of sins and then to set out the expiations prescribed for all of them, It should be noted that both the secular law of penalties and the ecclesiastical rules about expiations made a difference between a sinful act intentionally committed ( hānatah) and one com mitted through ignoranca or besdlessness and between an act done only once ( sakrt) or dono repeatedly (asakti)</p>
<p>Brahmahalya Halyā or vadha (killing) is applied to an act which immediately or after some time results in causing loss of life directly without the intervention of any other cause.36. The Agnipurāna (173 1), the Mit, the Prāyaścittaviveka ( 47 ) and other works define what is meant by vadha A man may be the cause of the death of a brāhmana in five ways, viz, he may himself kill (i e, he becomes the kartā), he may incite another to kill (prayojaka) by ordering that other to do so (as a king or noble by ordering his servant) or by imploring another to kill and giving advice about the killing, he may encourage another to kill by his own approval (anumanta), or by helping the killer when he wavers or by offering protection to the killer against others (anugrahaka ) and by becoming a ninutta, 37</p>
<p>The Mit on - Yaj. II. 227 and 243 ( quoting verses from Paithinasi) explains all these at length. For the definition of anugrāhaka it relies on a verse of Manu &ldquo;Where many persons are armed and have a coinmon purpose in view, if even one of them kills a person, all of them are guilty of murder, which is very much like sec. 34 of the Indian Penal Code. This distinc tion into several degrees of killers is an ancient one and is based on Āp Dh. S. II. 11. 29. 1-% &lsquo;He who78 instigates, be who approves, and he who commits an act-these share its results in heaven and hell; but be amongst these who contributes most to</p>

<p>One important question that very much exercised the minds of ancient and medieval Dharmaśāstra writers is whether a man can kill a brāhmana ātatāyin in self-defence without incurring any sin or punishment by the king. There is great divergence of views on this point, which has been dealt with at some length in H of Dh vol I pp. 148–151 and vol. III pp. 517-518. The conclusion of the Mitaksarā appears to voice the views of most writers that, if a brāhmana comes as an atatayin (as an incendi ary, as a poisoner, as a kidnapper of women or with the inten tion of killing or wresting a field), then in self-defence one may oppose him without incurring any sin, but that if the brāhmana offender meets death though the defender did not desire to kill him (but only to stop him by causing injury short of death), the</p>

<p>History of Dharmatūstra - I voli defender is not liable to be punished by tle king and he has to undergo a light expiation (i, e, he is not guilty of brāhmana&rsquo;s murder). 45</p>
<p>Surāpāna (drinking of suā) has beon lield to be a maha. pātaka The word surā occurs several times in the Rgveda (e g. Rg I 116 7, 1. 191.10, VII, 86 6, VIII.2 12, X 1079) Rg. VII. 86 6 quoted above (in note 17) clearly indicates that sura was looked upon by the Rgvedic singers as a cause of sin just as much as gambling Rg. I 1167 (satam kumbhān asiñcatam surāyah) road with Rg I 117.6 (satam madhūnām) implies that madhu (honey or some sweet substanca) might have been used in preparing surā Soma svas a beverage to be offered to the gods and to be drunk by the brāhmana priests and was sharply distinguished from surā (o &amp; in Tai S II 5 11, Vāj S. 197, Śat Br. V.1 5 28). The last furnishes the striking antithesis &lsquo;soma is truth, prosperity, light, and surā is untruth, misery, darkness&rsquo;. It appears that long before the Kathaka Sambitā brāhmanas had come to regard the drinking of sura as very sinful [ XII 12 &lsquo;therefore the brāhmapa does not drink surā (with the idea) that (by drinking it) he may become affected by sin&rsquo;) 46 The Chandogya Up. (V. 10.9) speaks of the drinker of surā as a patita, while in V.11 5 king47 Aśrapati Kaikeya makes the boast before the five learned brābmanas that had come to him for the knowledge of Alman Varśvānara that in his kingdom there was no thief and no drinker of madya. Though Manu XI 54 enumerates the drinking of surā among the five mahāpātakas, Vā). III. 227 speaks of the madyapa (drinker of madya) as one of the five great sinners. Therefore we must explain what is meant by surā and when surāpāna becomes a mahāpātaka. By Manu XI, 93 surā is said to be the refuse of food and Manu XI. 94 states that surū is of three kinds, viz that prepared from iolasses, that from flour and that from madhūka flowers (or from honey). There is a great deal of discussion about surā in many of the digests and the propositions</p>

<p>established by most of them are 8: (1) that all the three higher varnas are forbidden to drink the surā preparad from flour and drinking it is a grave sin (mahāpataka) in the case of anyone belonging to the three first yarpas, (2) All intoxicants (madya) are forbidden to brāhmanas at all stages of life (Gaut. II. 25 &lsquo;madyam nityam brāhmanal&rsquo; and Āp. Dh, S, I 5. 17-21); but a brālimana drinking surā of the gaudi or mādlyi kind would not ba guilty of mahāpātaka but of anupataka (acc to Vispu); (3) that intoxicants other than surā prepared from flour are not con demned for ksatriyas and Faiśgas; (4) the sūdra was not for bidden to drink any kind of intoxicant (including surā made from flour); (5) brahmacārins of all varnas studying the Veda had to abstain from intoxicants of all kinds. The Vispu Dh. S. (22 83-84) specifies ten kinds of madya (intoxicants) prepared from dates, jack fruit, cocoanuts, sugarcane &amp;c and Pulastya quoted by the Mit on Yāj. III. 253, by the Prayascittaprakarapa of Bhavadera ( 40), the Prāyaścittaviveka of Sūlapāni (p. 90), Pr.

<p>The Mit points out (on Yāj III, 253) that the prohibition against drinking surā applies to boys who have not yet been in Fested with the sacred thread and also to unmarried girls, since Manu XI 93 makes no distinction of sex but only forbids to the three first castes the drinking of surā and since the Bhavisyapurāna49 expressly forbids to a brāhmada female the drinking of surā The Kalpataru appears to have held otherwise, But a woman and a minor had to undergo lesser prāyascitta as will be shown below. Vas 21 11 and Yāj III 256 state that the wife of a brahmana, ksatriya or vaiśya who drinks surā (made from flour)would not reach the worlds of her husband and she</p>

In order to constitute theft as a grave sin according to the commentaries the theft must be of a brāhmada&rsquo;s gold of a certain quantity Steya is defined by Ap DhS I 1028 1 ass&quot;a man becomes a thief by coveting another&rsquo;s property (and taking it) in whatever situation he</p>

Vācaspati in his bhāsya on Yogasūtra IT. 30 defides steya as taking property from another in a manner that is not allowed by the śāstras (steyam asāstra-pūryakam dravyānām paratah śvīkaranam).

<p>Steya as Mahapātaka</p>
<p>for steya Manu (XI, 99 &lsquo;suvardasteyakrt) and Yaj. I, 257 (brāhmanesvarbahari) add the qualification that he should be a thief guilty of stealing gold (from a brālımapa, acc. to Yāj ). Vas, 20. 41 and Cyavana (q by Pr V. p. 117) mention &lsquo;brāhmana suvarda-harana&rsquo; as a mahāpataka and the Samaridhāra Br. (I, 6.1) also employs the words brāhmadasyam brtvā&rsquo;. Vide Samvarta 122 and Viśvāmitra (q. by Pr. V. p. 108). A further qualification was added by Viśvarūpa (on Yāj III. 25% &lsquo;anākhyāya &amp;c), the Mit. (on Yāj. II. 257), the Madana pārijāta (pp 827-28), Prayascittaprakarana (P. 72), the Prayascittaviveka ( 111) and other commentators that the gold stolen must be at least sixteen māsas in weight, otherwise there is no mahāpatakas. So, if a man steals gold belonging to a brahmana which is less than 16 māsas or steals gold of any weight (even more than 16 māsas) from a non-brāhmana (i, e. from a ksatriya or the like) he would be guilty only of a minor sin (upapātaka). The Mit relies on the verses of Yaj. I 362-363 for the technical meaning of suvarna (as 16 māsas) There was no guilt of theft acc. to Vārsyāyani if (Ap. Dh, S, I 10. 28.2) a person took only a small quantity of cereals ripening in pods (such as mudga, maṣa and gram) or took grass for his oxen while he was going in a cart.56) According to Gautama 12.25 a man may take (without permission and without incurring the guilt of theft) for the sake of cows and for the sake of śraula or smārta fires grass, fuel and flowers of trees and plants as if they were his own property and the fruits (of trees and plants) that are not fenced around. Manu VII, 339 (=Matsya 227. 112-113) is almost Jike Gaut 12.25 and Manu VII, 341 adds that a traveller of the three higher castes may, if his provisions have run short, tako (without fear of punishment) from another&rsquo;s field two sugarcane stalks and two mūlakas (esculent roots).</p>
<p>Gurvanganāganah (sexual intercourse with the wife of the guru). Manu (X1,54) employs this word, while Yāj. II, 227 and Vas. 20.13 speak of the offender as gurutalpaga (who violates the bed of the guru) and Vas. I. 20 mentions the sin as &lsquo;gurutalpana</p>

This would have been unnecessary if gur utalpa was primarily meant to include the teacher&rsquo;s wife; while the Pr. V. relies upon Gaut.

S, 31.1-2 three persons are atrgurus (exceed even guru in their greatness) viz. the mother, the father and the ācārya and Devala who mentions eleven parsons as gurus. The Pr. M, does not seem to be quite correct since the Pr. V. ultimately (pp. 134-135) states its final view that guru here means only the father and not the acārya and others and that Vispu Dh.

<p>of nine kinds of satsarga (contact or association) out of which the first five were treated as light sins, but the other four were serious viz, Occupying the same bed or seat, taking food in the same row with the sidner, cooking food in the sinner&rsquo;s cooking pots or partaking of food prepared by him, being his sacrificial priest or employing him as one&rsquo;s sacrificial priest, being the sinner&rsquo;s teacher of the Veda or employing him as one&rsquo;s teacher of the Veda, sexual intercourse, taking food with him in the same pot. The Pr Prakasa (folio 74a) holds that samsarga is of three kinds, the highest, middling and lovest. The first includes four viz. yonisambandha (marriage), srauva (</p>
<p>ie that due to sacrificing for a sinner or making him a priest), maulcha (about learning or teaching Veda) and eating of food from the same vessel (ekāmatrabhojana), the middling is of five kınds viz. using the same vehicle, seat, bed or coverlet, eating in the same row and learning the Veda together ( sahadhyayana) The lowest is of various other kinds such as intimate talks, touching, cooka ing food in the same vessel, eating food at his house, receiving a gift from him &amp;c Adhyāpana in order to be a great sin must relate to the Veda, and so also yājana must relate to such Vedic sacrifices as Darbapūrpamāsa, Caturmāsya, Agajstoma Helping &amp; mahāpatakin to perform the five daily yajñas or teaching him the angas (metrics, grammar etc.) and the śāstras is only a minor sin. Parāgara62 (XII. 79) states that sins are transferred (or spread) from man to man like a drop of oil on vater by sitting or sleeping together or by using the same conveyance or by speaking with or dining in the same row. Devala and Chāgaleya q, by the Mit, on Yāj. VII 261, the Pr. Prakarana (p. 101), the Pr. V. (p. 145), the Par M. (II. part 1. p 28) and others contain similar Yerses. Acc. to Pr. Prakāśa (folio 75a), in order to become palita one must simultaneously practice these four together, if practised separately, there is no pārtya but only dosa. Parāsara (I. 25-26) states that in the Krta age a man became pauta by speaking with a palita, in Tretā by touching him, in Dvāpara by partaking of food prepared in his house and in Kali by actually committing a sinful act and that in tha Krta age a district was abandoned (if any one therejn became patuta), in Tretā the village, in Drāpara the family of the patta was abandoned) and in Kali only the actual perpetrator himself (18</p>

It is clear from this that such contacts with a patita as speaking with him,63 touching him or eating food (in the house of a patita) were not regarded as involving a man in the same sin as that of the actual perpetrator. Speak ing, touching and eating are also actions (karman) and Parāśara did not include them in the word &lsquo;karmanā&rsquo; which Tefers only to the actual perpetration of a murder, surāpana etc. Therefore when some writers include such contacts as eating or touching under &ldquo;karmana&rsquo; they put two meanings on the ' word karman in Parāśara viz. perpetration of a murder or the like and also doing some of the acts (touching, eating) which are forbidden to be done in reference to a perpetrator by somo &lsquo;smrtis. This is a procedure which is against the maxim of the Mimāmsā that the same word conveys only one sease in the game context The reasonable inference from the words of Parāśara is that merely touching a mahāpātakın or eating food in his house did not involve the toucher and eater in patutya. In spite of this medieval writers gradually extended the scope of samsarga in a spirit of exclusiveness and of over-emphasis on ideas of ceremonial purity - For example, the Sinṭtyarthasara 65 (p. 112) remarks that he who associates with the person that associates with a malāpātakin has to undergo half the expiation that the first associator has to undergo. But that work does not go beyond this. The Mit. (on Yāj III. 261) appears to hold that the associator even though he does not be como patita is liable to undergo expiation and that even the 4th and 5th associators in a series are liable to undergo expiation</p>

Apastamba-sporti67 (II, 1-3) states, &lsquo;if a cāndāla stays in the house of any one of the four castes without being kuown, the latter on coming to know of the fact should undergo expiation, which is Cāndrāyana or Parāka for a member of the first three vardas and Prājāpatya for a sūdra, Those who partook of cooked food in that man&rsquo;s house should undergo Krochra; one should prescribe one half of Kșochra for those who took cooked food in the house of the 2nd associator and for those who partook of cooked food in the house of these last one fourth of Krochra is piesci abed&rsquo;. So besides the oliginal associator three more in succession were held to be liable for prayas citta. Mercifully they stopped at the 4th from the original associator A few writers took a more reasonable view.

<p>there is no blenish of samsarga and that it is ou account of this that in the enumeration of things to be avoided or not allowed in the Kali age (Kalz-varjya) another smrti includes &lsquo;pollution through contact with a sinner&rsquo; (as a Kalivariya). The Smrtimuktaphala (Prayascitta. pp. 897-98) echoes the very words of Madhava and quotes further authorities on the point69. The Nirdayasindhu holds that though there is blame in association with a patra the associator does not himself become pattta. As Yaj III. 261 employs the word &lsquo;vatsaram&rsquo; and as the accusative of time is, acc. to Panini, to be used only when there is &lsquo;atyantasamyoga&rsquo; of time and space (distance ) it follows that the associator who is to undergo penance for contact must have been day and night in contact for a year, Devala employs the word &lsquo;sārvakālıkam&rsquo; in this connection,</p>
<p>Though many crimes do not in so many words come within the words of the definitions of the mahāpātakas the smrtis extend by analogy the saine condemnation as the mahapatakas in three ways. For example, Yaj. III. 251 expressly states that one who kills a ksatriya or Yaibya engaged in (soma) sacrifice or a foetus or an atreyi woman has to undergo the same expiation as for brāhmana murder (therefore this is vācanikūtideśa). Yay. III. 232-233 extends the sin of gui utalpa-gamana to intercourse with several near female relatives (such as mother&rsquo;s or father&rsquo;s sister), This is extension by tādrūpya. The smrtis declare many actions as equal to ( sama) mahāpātakas in general or as equal to one of the mahāpātakas, This is alıdeśa by sāmya. A few words must be said on this topic. The general rule is that the expia tion for those lapses that are declared to be equal to a mabāpātaka is less than (i. e. half of) what would be prescribed</p>

<p>[Vol. for the mahāpataka itself!. And the penance for those that come under atrdeśa of the vacanika or tādrūpya kind is three fourths of that for the mahāpātaka itself. But it has to be noted - that there is divergence of views about these in the sūtras and the smrtis Acc, to Gaut 21.10 giving72 false evidence, backbiting about another&rsquo;s guilt that will reach the king, falsely accusing one&rsquo;s guru with a grave sin or crime are equal to malāpātaka. Ini Manu XI 55 (=Agnipurāna 168. 25) the last two of these three and false statement about one&rsquo;s caste or learning or family (1 e. . saying that one is a brālimana whep one is not) for securing pro sparity or eminenca are stated to be equal to brāhmapa&rsquo;s murder. Acc to Yaj. III 228 falsely charging one&rsquo;s guru is equal to brahmahatyā aod false statement about one&rsquo;s caste or learning is equal to drinking surā (Vā). III 229), while acc, to Visou Dh. S 37.1-3 the three sins mentioned in Manu XI, 55 are to be in cluded among minor sins (upapalakas), while giving false evid ence is declared by Visou to be equal to drinking sura (36.2). No useful purpose would be served by dilating at great length on the divergences of smrtis on what lapses are equal to one of the Mahāpatakas. The digests explain that where the same lapse is described as equal to surāpāna by one smrti and as equal to brāhmana-murder by another the idea is that there is an option as to the penance prescribed for that lapse. There fore only the remarks of Manu and Yaj. will be set out hero. Manu XI. 56 (=Agnipurāna 168, 26 ) prescribes that forgetting the Veda ( already studied ), reviling the Vedas, giving false evidence, killing a friend, eating forbidden food or food that should not be eaten, these sis are equal to surāpāna. Vide Yāj III 228 already referred to above. Manu XI. 57 holds that stealing a deposit or a man or horse or silver or land or diamonds and other gems is equal to the theft of brahmana&rsquo;s gold. Yaj. III, 230, Visnu Dh S. 5 383, Agni purāna 168. 27 ara to the same effect. Aco to Manu XI. 58 ( Agnipurāna 168 28 ) carnal intercourse with a sister by the same mother, with maidens, with females of the lowest castes (like Candālas), with the wife of a friend or son is declared to</p>

<p>be equal to the violation of a guru&rsquo;s bed. Yāj. II, 231 is practically the same (but he adds intercourse with a sagotra woman to the list). Gaut. 23.12 and Mapu XI. 170 are very similar. Yāj. III, 232-233 declare that a man who has sexual intercourse with a sister of his father or mother, with his maternal uncle&rsquo;s wife, with his daughter-in-law, with a co-wife of his mother, with his sister, with the daughter or wife of his Vedic teacher or his own daughter, is guilty of being a violator of the guru&rsquo;s bed and should have his penis cut off and be killed (by the king) and the woman concerned, if she was a willing party, should also be killed, Nārada (stripunsayoga, verses 73–75)73 states: &ldquo;If a man has sexual intercourse with any of these women viz. mother, mother&rsquo;s sister, mother-in-law, maternal uncle&rsquo;s wife, father&rsquo;s sister, a wife of the paternal uncle or of a friend or of a pupil, a sister, sister&rsquo;s friend, daughter-in-law, daughter, the wife of one&rsquo;s Vedic teacher, a woman of the same gotra, one who has come for protection, a queen, an ascetic woman, one&rsquo;s wet-nurse, a woman performing a vrata and a brāhmana woman, he becomes guilty of the sin of the violator of the guru&rsquo;s bed (i. e, incest). For that crime zo other punishment is laid down except that of the cutting of the penis.&rdquo; These two, Yāj. and Nārada, show that excision of the organ and death are both the expiation and the punishment for this crime. The Mit. (on Yāj II, 233) adds that this punish ment applies only to the offenders other than a brāhmana, since Manu (VIII, 380) prescribes that a brāhmada offender should not be punished with death whatever sin or crime he niay have committed and that he is to be banished from the country unhurt and is to retain all his wealth. The Vispudharma-sūtra (36.4-77) adds a few more women to the list of Yaj and Narada (such as a woman in her monthly illness, the wife of a learned brāhniana or of one&rsquo;s sacrificial priest or of one&rsquo;s Upadhyāya).</p>

XV, 18), killers of kine, those who forgot the Voda, those wbo pronounce Vedic texts for these last, Vedic students who broak the vow of chastity and those who allow the time for upanayana to pass without performing it. Saṅkho quoted by Viśvarūpa on Yaz ID 229-236 mentions only 18 upapātakas and styles them unapałaniyas The longest lists are contained in Manu XT 59-66, Yaj III 231-242, Vrddha-Hārita IX, 208-210, Visnudharmasutra 37 and Agnipurāna (168 29-37), AC cording to the Pr.

<p>Manu XI. 67 (=Agnipurāna 16886, 37-38) and Vispu Dh, S. 38 1-6 mention certain lapses as &lsquo;Jatiburamsakara&rsquo; ( that cause the loss of caste ) viz giving pain to a brālmapa (by means of a stick or by the hand), smelling things which ought not to be smelt at (such as garlic, ordure &amp;c.) and smelling spirituous liquor, cheating (saying one thing and doing another), an unnatural offence with a man or beast also, aco to Visau) According to Manu XI 68 (=Agnipurana 168 38-39), killing a donkey, a horse, a camel, a deer, an elephant, a goat, sheep, fish, a snake or a buffalo must be known to be sankarikarana (reducing one to a mixed caste). Visou 29, 1 says that sankarikarapa is the killing of village of forest animals, Manu XL. 69 holds that accepting presents from condemned men (such as those mentioned in Manu IV. 84), trading, serving sūdras and speaking a falsehood make &amp; man unvorthy to receive gifts (apatrikarana). The Visnu. Dh. S. 40.1 adds &lsquo;maintaining one&rsquo;s self by usury&rsquo; to these. Manu XI. 70 prescribes that killing insects, small or large, or birds, eating any thing kept close to spirituous liquors, stealing fruits, fuel and flowers and unsteadiness of mind are malāvaha (which make a man impure). Visou Dh. S. 41. 1-4 are similar. Vispu Dh, S. 42, 1 says all other lapses not specifically mentioned in</p>

<p>Having dealt at length with several classes or grades of sins, we have now to address ourselves to the question of the consequences of sins and the means recommended or adopted for removing sin and its consequences.</p>
<p>It has already been shown above how the sages of the Rgveda prayed to the gods, particularly to Aditi, Mitra, Varupa, the Adityas and Agni to free them from agas or enas eto. They often say that they violated the dharmas or the valas (ordinances) of the gods and imploie forgiveness They were afraid of the consequences of their guilt, viz. the god&rsquo;s apger, They thought that when God was angered by their transgres sions he smote them with &ldquo;adversity, destruction, disease and death. For example, they prey &lsquo;whatever ordinance (vrata) of yiyurs we may violate every day like subjects in the case of a king&rsquo;s ordinances) do not subject us to your death-dealing blow&rsquo; (Rg I 25 2), &lsquo;O Varunal whatever transgression we men have committed towards the divine host and whatever rules of yours wo may have confounded through heedlessness, do not, on</p>

<p>IV</p>
<p>Fear of conséqrences of sin</p>
<p>account of that sin (enas),&rsquo; strike us down&rsquo; (Rg. VII. 89.5)88 In Rg X 89.8-9 it is said that Indra hurls his sharp and deadly Teapon at those who break the settled order (dbarman) of Mitra, Varuna and Aryaman. The gods are implored to save the worshipper from the deadly attacks of the wolf and from sinking into a pit (in adversity) in æg. II, 29.6. In Rg. IX. 73.8 it is said that the wise God has his eye on all worlds and he pierces in pits those who do not observe his ordinances and who are therefore not liked by him89. On the other hand, when God is pleased with the worshipper, he is implored to lead the latter by the path of vi tue (Rg. I 189.1), to confer happiness on the wor shipper&rsquo;s offspring (Rg I. 189 %, IV, 12.5) and to bestow wealth on bim (Rg VII. 45 40).</p>
<p>In the Rgveda the first means of removing the consequences of sin appear to be prayers for mercy and for the remission of sin as in Rg. VII. 86.4-5, VIL 88, 6–7, VIL 89.1-4 (where &lsquo;mflā suksatra mrlaya&rsquo; is the refrain of all four verses). Even in the Rgveda water Tas supposed to remove sin, e g. I. 23. 22 says &lsquo;O water! carry away whatever sin(durata)may exist in pe&rsquo;. This shows that sin was supposed to have physical effects like a disease, which Tere removed by water, Sacrifices were offered to the gods in order to win their favour and in order that the sacrificer may be freedoo from the consequences of even grave sins. The Tai S. V. 3.12 1-2 and the Sat. Br. XIII, 3, 1. 1 (S. B. E, VOL. 44 p. 328) state that the gods redeemed themselves from all sin by means of this (Aśramedha sacrifice), they even redeemed themselves from the sin of brāhmapa murder. That a confession of sin was deemed to remove sin is illustrated in a striking way by what happened in the Varupapraghāsa (one of the cāturmāsya sacrifices). In thato sacrifice the wife of the sacrificer had to confess whether she had any lovers and if she felt ashamed to</p>

S III 44 and was allowed to take further part in the sacrifice If she con cealed the truth, it was stated in the Tai. Br that evil would be. fall her near and dear relatives (her son or husband). It is said by many European scholars who have written on the religion of the Veda that sacrifice became a sort of magic rite to wrest from gods or independently of them what the worshipper desired (eg, see Keith&rsquo;s Religion and Philosophy of the Veda and Upanishads pp. 260-268) 92 But this is an over-statement When initiated for a sacrifice the sacrificer and his wife had to observe a fast or live on a low diet, both were called upon to observe many strict rules such as telling the truth, they had to make large preparations and spend wealth on the materials and the fees to the priests, These things were deemed to cleanse the mind and soul of the taint of sin. There is no reason to suppose that it was only the ritual that was thought to bring about the desired result (and not all the other matters referied to above).</p>
<p>We shall now discuss the prescriptions of the sūtras and smrtis about the consequences of sins.</p>
<p>In this connection the doctrines of Karma and Purarjanma must be well remembered The details of the origin and develop ment of those doctrines will be discussed in a later section, Here it is enough to state the few main propositions of the doctrine of Karma The fundamental proposition is that cause and effect are as inseparably linked in the moral sphere as assumed in the physical sphere by science. A good action has its reward and a bad act leads to retribution. If the bad actions do not yield their consequences at once or in this life, the soul begins another existence and in the new environment undergoes suffering for its past bad deeds The theory of karma and</p>

<p>IV)</p>
<p>Rarma and punarjanma</p>
<p>the theory of transmigration of souls (of pre-existence and post-existence) are inextricably mixed up in Indian thought from at least the ancient times of the Upanisads. The general rule is that Karma, whether good or evil, cannot be got rid of, except by enjoying or undergoing its consequences. This is said by Gaut. 19. 5, Markandeya-purāna and many other works. &lsquo;Because the deed does not perish&rsquo; Gaut. 93; &lsquo;whatever human action it may be, whether good or evil, it cannot be got rid of except by enjoying its consequences; know from me that a man gets rid of good and evil deeds by enjoying their con sequences)&rsquo;. This doctrine is based on the Sat. Br. V, 22.27, Br. Up IV. 4 and VI. 2, Chān, Up. III, 14, and V, 3–10, Katha 5. 6-7 and other Upanisad texts.</p>
<p>Therefore they say, &lsquo;a man is born again in that world for which he has worked.&rsquo; &lsquo;According as a man acts and accord ing as he believes so will be be; a man of meritorious acts will be meritorious, a man of evil deeds sinful He becomes pure by pure deeds and evil by evil deeds. And here they say that a person consists of desires And as is his desire, so is his will; and as is his will, so is his deed; and whatever deeds he does that he will reap&rsquo; (Br. Up. IV. 4, 5); &lsquo;a man is made up of will; whatever he wills in this world the same he becomes after departing from this world&rsquo; (Chān. Up. I, 14, 1); &lsquo;some human beings enter the womb in order to have an embodied existence; others go into inorganic matter (the stump of a tree and the like) according to their deeds and according to their knowledge&rsquo; (Katha Up. 5, 7). 94</p>
<p>&lsquo;Actions done by a man do not perish unless they (i e, their consequences) are enjoyed even after crores of years, (the fruits of) actions whether good or evil must of necessity be enjoyed95,&rdquo;</p>

<p>just as a calf finds out its own mother from among thousands of Cows, so actions done in a former life unerringly reach the parpetrator thereof.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But this general principle pas modified in various ways by the smrtis and later writings. Gautama 19.1196(=Vasistha 22.8) states. &lsquo;Reciting the Veda jnaudibly (Japa), austerities, a saciifice, fasting and giving gifts are the means of expiating that (i e, a blamable act)&rsquo; Vas, 20. 47 and 25. 3 lay down &lsquo;A. sinner is freed from sin by tormenting his body, by austerities, by reciting the Veda and also by making gifts&rsquo; and &lsquo;those who are constant ly engaged in prānāyāmas (suppression and regulation of breath), raciting purificatory texts, giving gifts, offering sacrifices, muttering sacred texts &lsquo;will undoubtedly be freed from sing&rsquo;. Manu III, 227 observes. &lsquo;by confession, by repentance, by austerity, by reciting Vedic texts (sacred Gāyatri or other texts), a sinner is freed from guilt and in case of difficulty (i, e. if he is unable to perform austerities or to recite Vedic texts) by liberality&rsquo;. Similar provisions occur in Parāsara X, 40, Sātātapa T, 4, Samvarta 203, Harita (q, in Pr. T. p 467), Yama, (q. in Pr. V. pp 30, 31 ), Bhavisyapurāna (q. by Pr. V. p. 31 )</p>
<p>Before proceeding with the subject of prāyaścittas we shall speak briefly about the other means of reducing the con sequences of sin And first comes confession With reference to tlie confession of paramours by the wife in the Varunapraghāsa, the Tai. Br. (I. 6. 5. 2)97 says &lsquo;He makes the wife confess, there by he renders her pure and then he leads her to penance&rsquo;. The Sat. Br. (II. 5. 2. 20) puts it in this form &lsquo;for when confessed the sin becomes less, since it becomes tluth&rsquo;. This was a confession before God (Fire) and men (the priests ) to restore one to divine forgiveness and favour As regards several lapses, confession was part of the procedure prescribed for atoning for the sin,</p>
