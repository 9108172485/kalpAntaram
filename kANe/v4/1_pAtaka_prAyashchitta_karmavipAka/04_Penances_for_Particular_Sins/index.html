  <p>CHAPTER IV</p>
<p>PENANCES FOR PARTICULAR SINS</p>
<p>It is now proper to turn to the penances prescribed for individual sins of different types (grave sins, minor sins and the like). It may be noted that the smrtis contain numerous prāyaścittas for the same sin and that it is often difficult to reconcile all the dicta The commentaries and digests such as the Mit and the Prāgascitta-viveka therefore try to assign to each pobancs an appropriate provision, looking to all the circum stances noted above (i.e they are bont on &lsquo;visayavyavastha&quot;).206 In this work, it is not necessary to set out in detail the numerous penances for numberless lapses that are prescribed in the several smrtis and digests. In the Sabdakalpadruma (part III) there is an analysis from the Prayasoitta-viveka alone of the several lapses, the penances for them, the number of cows to be donated as substitutes, the monetary equivalents when even COVs cannot be donated and the dalcsınā in each case, which occupy pages 321 to 364. Satting out all these lapses together with the penances for them would only be a matter of academic interest and of no practical value, as almost all the prāyaścittaa have become antiquated and are hardly ever performed now except in the form of gifts of cows or money to brahmanas, pilgrimages and recitation of Vedic mantras or japa of the names of some favourite deity such as Visdu or Śiva. Therefore only a few typical sins alone will be taken for treatment here and later on a list of all penances with brief descriptions will be furnished.</p>
<p>First come the Mahāpātakas, Saṅkha 207 (17.1-3) prescribes the following penance for the four mahāpātakas: the sinner should bathe thrice every day, should erect in a forest a cottage thatched with leaves, should sleep on the ground, should subsist</p>

<p>on leaves, roots and fruits, should enter a village for alms all the time declaring his misdeed, should eat only once a day. When the 12th year passes in this way, the thief of gold, the drinker of surā, the murderer of a brāhuiapa and one who is guilty of incest become free from sin. Viṣṇu Dh S. 34.1 speaks of sexual intercourse with one&rsquo;s mother, daughter or daughter in-law ag aanūtala and (34.2) provides that there is no penance ercept entering fire for this grave sin. The Bhaviṣyapurana, Hārīta and Samyarta (q. by the Pr. V p 43) say the same But other smrtis like Manu XI. 54 and Yaj III 227 treat māte gamana as &amp; mahāpātaka (gurutalpa-gamana) and intercourse with the daughter or daughter-in-law as equal to yiolating guru&rsquo;s bed (Manu XI. 58, Yi). III. 233-234). Therefore we begin with the mahāpatakas the first of which is the murder of a brāhmapa Gaut. 22 2-10, Ap Dh, S I. 9.24 10-25 and I. 9 25 12-13, Vas 20. 25-28, Visou Dharmasūtra 35.6 and 50. 1-6 and 15, Manu, XL 72-82, Yāj III 243-250, Agnipurāna 169. 1-4 and 173 7-8, Samyarta 110-115 and many others prescriba various penances for brālmana-murder. As the treat ment of Manu is tolerably long, an analysis of it alone will be</p>
<p>given liere, Manu as stated by the Bhaviṣyapurada (quoted by Kullūka op Manu XI. 72-82, Aparārka p 1055 and Pr Y, p 63) speaks of 13 separate penances for brahmahatya 20%. The general rule was that for a man of any class who is directly guilty of intentional murder of a brālimana the penance was to end in death209. The thirteen penances as set out by Govindananda in his commentary (called Tattvārthakaumudi) on Prayascittaviveka (p 63) are as follows</p>
<p>(1) The murderer of a brāhmana should construct a hut in a forest and dwell therein for twelve years, should subsist on alms and should carry a piece of the head-bones of the murdered man on &amp; staff. This is a very ancient penance and other smrtis add some details. For example, Gaut 2% 4 provides that the sinner should submit to observances meant for a Vedic student (such as not partaking of flesh, honey etc. stated in</p>

<p>IVE Prājaścittas for murder Gaut.3.19), should announce his sin and enter a village only for begging alms. Yaj. III. 243 prescribes that the sinner should have a piece of the head-bone in the hand (left) and another placed on a staff (in the right hand) and that he should sat a moderate quantity&rsquo; (i e. only once a day). The carrying of the piece of the head-bone in one hand is not meant for beggipg alms thorein but only as a symbol, There was some.divorgenooi of views on this point,209a, Ấp Dh. S, 1.9.-24, 14 further provides that he should beg for alms at seven houses in only a broken reddish vessel (of clay or copper) and wear a piece of hempen cloth round his waist that will reach a little above his knees and that if he got no food at the seven houses he had to go with out food that day and that he should protect cows and may for that purpose (for taking them out for grazing or bringing them back) enter the village again. The Mit. (on Yaj. II. 243) adds that the staff with head-bone on and the head-bone carried in. the left hand are merely symbolic (in order to remind him and others of his being guilty of brāhmada murder), that he-should on seeing an arya avoid his path (Gant. 22.5), - that the should keep standing by day and only sit down at night (Gaut. 82.6) and bathe thrice in the day (Gaut. 22.6). It is added by the Mit. that, if the murdered brahmana&rsquo;s head-bone cannot be had, that of any other brahmana would do. The Mit. adds that this vrata 210 for twelve years propounded by Gautama, Manu, Yājñavalkya and others is one and not different for each smrti and therefore a}] the details that are not opposed to sach other should be included. Apararka p. 1053 (on Yai. III. 243) relies on the &lsquo;sarvasakhapratyayanyaya&rsquo; and statest</p>

<p>that there would be an option where the details of several smartis are in conflict. It was Viśvarūpa 212 on Yā). III, 237 who held that the procedure prescribed by each smrti vas separate and that all details taken from different smrtis were not to be roixed up. According to the Mit, and Kullūka (on Manu XI. 72) this vrata for 12 years is appropriate in the case where a brāhmana is murdered unintentionally and Kullaka quoting Angiras provides that for intentional brāhmana murder tho penance will be double (i. e. 24 years). The Mit (on Yaj. II. 243) states that this observance for twelve years applies only to one who syas himself directly the murderer of a bralniana and that the anugrāhaka has to undergo only 9 years&rsquo; vrata, the prayojaka only six years, the anumanta only 4 years and the nimittin only three years. It is further provided by the Mit. (on Yaj. III. 243) following a verse ascribed to Manu (not found in the printed text) and Devala 213 that if a man commits several murders of brāhmanas one after another, and performs ponance at one time for them, for two inurders he has to undergo the penance for 24 years and for three murders 36 years and when he commits the 4th murder there is no ponance (but only death is the penance). The Pr. T. (P. 468) on the othor hand, 214 following the Bhaviṣya-purāna holds that one per formance of the 12 years&rsquo; penance is enough penance for the murder of several brālmanas, on the analogy of the Ksāmavati isti (Jai. VI. 4. 17-20 ) which is performed whon both the purodāgas and the house are totally burnt up by accident before the oblations are offered. The Pr. Prakasa (folio 19 a) also says the same and adds that Devala&rsquo;s Forse is to be interpreted as laying down that repetition of tho samo sinful act is more blamable.

<p>was a ksatriya or &amp; vaiśya or a śūdra he had to perform the penance above described respectively for 24, 36 or 48 years. (Smrtyarthasāra p. 105). Instead of staying in a hut for twelve years he may stay at the end of a village or a cowpen and should tónsure his head and the hair on the lips or he may stay in an hermitage or at the foot of a tree and should devote himself to doing good to brāhmanas and cows and should observe celibacy (Manu XI. 78 and 81). At the end of 12 years he destroys the sin of brahmana-murder,</p>
<p>(2) According to Ap Dh. S. I, 9.25.12, Gaut 22, 3, Manu XI, 72, Yā. III, 248, if a ksatriya intentionally killed a brāhmana he may at his will enter a fight and if he werā killed, by his opponents who knew that he was a brāhmana murderer, or even if he was wounded and left unconscious on the field but subsequently recovered he should be free from the sin of brāhmaṇa-murder,</p>
<p>(3) According to Āp. Dh, S. I. 9.25.13, Vas. 20. 25-26, Gaut, 22.2, Madu XI, 74, Yāj. TIL 247, he may cut off with ano axe his hair, skin, blood, flesh, muscles, fat, bones and marrow and offer them into an ordinary fire kindled by him for the purpose and offer these sight offerings into it for Death 215 (Mrtyu) as the deity and then throw himself into fire (thrice: with head downwards, according to Manu XI. 73). This pen.&rsquo; ance is for intentional murder of a brāhmapa by a ksatriya aco: to the Madanapārijāta and Bhaviṣyapurāpa q. by Pr. Prakāśa folio 95 a.</p>
<p>(4)-(8) The murderer of a brāhmana may perform the Asyamedha sacrifica or Gosava or Abhijit or Viśvajit or the threefold Agnistut (Manu XI, 74) The Aśramedha could be performed only by a king or an emperor (samrāj). The others&rsquo; could be performed by any one belonging to the three higher classes This applies only where the murder was unintentional as stated by Kullūka following the Bhaviṣyapurāna,216&quot; Vispu*</p>

<p>(9) Manu XL 75 provides that for the removal of the sin of brahmahatya, the sinner may walk one hundred yojanas, sub sisting on limited food, controlling his senses and reciting one of the four Vedas, Kullūka says that this appjies only where she killing is unintentional and the victim is a mere brāhmana by caste (i. e, has not studied the Veda &amp;c.).

<p>(11) Manu XI, 76 and Yaj II 250 provide that the mura derer may donate to a worthy brāhmana (who has studied the Veda and whose character is good) as much wealth as would suffice to maintain the latter throughout his life and a house with all paraphernalia. This is the view of Govindananda. But tha Mit, on Yaj. II. 250 appears to hold that Nos 10 and 11 are not separate penances It combines the two into one, viz. that if the murderer has no offspring then he was to donate all his wealth or if he had offspring he was to donate a bouse with paraphernalia. This explanation is certainly preferable, The Smrtyarthasāra (p 105) states that if the murderer is devoid of qualities but is well-off he may give a house and lands suficient for the maintenance of a worthy brāhmana or he may donate a house with appurtenances or if he be childless all his wealth.</p>

<p>ghee) should follow the course of the (holy ) river Sarasvati in all its branches. This, acc. to the Bhaviṣyapurāna and Kullūka, applies where a mere brahmana by caste (without Vedic learning) is killed intentionally by a man who is himself rich but has no vedic learning. The words &lsquo;pratisrotah sarasvatim&rsquo; have been variously explained. Medhātithi explains as above. Apararka, Barvajianārāyana and Raghavānanda explain that the murderer should follow the course of the Sarasvati in the opposite direc tion from the sea to its origin. This appears to be a better explanation, since it brings out the force of &lsquo;pratisrotah&rsquo; more clearly,</p>
<p>(13) It is provided by Manu XL, 77 and Yāj. II. 249 that the murderer should recite in a forest thrica the sainhatā text of the Veda, while subsisting on limited food. The express mention of samhita text precludes the pada text or krama. The Bhaviṣyapurada and Kullūka hold that this ponance is proper where a mere brahmana by birth (without Vedic learning ) is killed unintentionally.</p>
<p>Manu XI. 79, Yāj. III, 244 and 246, Vas, 20.27-28 and Gaut. 2%, 7-8 and 11 mention three more penances, but they are not independent ones ( as is made clear by Saṅkha). If a murderer, while undergoing the 12 years&rsquo; penance, fights hin who attacks a brāhmana and saves him (or fights for the king, acc. to Vas.) or dies in the attempt, he becomes at once free from the sin and if he lives after the fight he had not to continue the penance for the whole period. The same applies to the saving of 12 cows by the murderer by putting his own life in danger219, Similarly, if a murderer fights &amp; marauder depriving a brahmana of all his wealth and restores the wealth to 2 brāhmana or dies in the atterapt or is severely wounded (thrice acc. to Yāj, Vas and Gaut.) and is unable to restore the wealth to the brābmana he becomes free from the grave sin of brahmapa murder.</p>

<p>Yaj. DI. 245 provides that if the murderer treats and cares a brahmana or a cow (or cows ) lying helpless on the public road suffering from a long-standing and serious ailment he becomes free from the sin,</p>
<p>Parāśara (XI, 65-67) prescribes for brah mahalyi the penance of going to the sea and Rama&rsquo;s bridge, begging and declaring on the way one&rsquo;s sin, walking ithout on umbrella or shoes and residing in compens, forests, tirthas and rirer streams; on seeing the setu he was to bathe in the ocean and on return to feed brālımadas at a dinner and to donate 100 con to learned brahmapas,</p>

<p>Prayascittas for brahma-halyā</p>
<p>age at the time of finishing twelve years and 120 years (which is regarded as the highest limit of life ). If a person strikes &amp; brahmana intending to kill him but only injures him he should perform the vrata for brahmahatyā (acc. to Yāj. II, 252, Gaut, 22.11). The Mit. explains that this is an extension (atrdeśa) of the rules about brahmahalyā and so the penance is a little Joss than the full one (i. o. 9 years). Where certain sins aro said to be equal / sama ) to bralımahatya or surāpāna, the penance for them is half of what is prescribed for the latter. If a person intending to commit suicide by entering water or fire or by hanging himself or by taking poison or by falling from a precipice or the dome of a temple or by cutting his belly with a weapon or by fasting, does not dia, but luckily lives, he has to undergo a prayascitta for three years (acc. to Pr. Prakarana p. 15). Vas. 23, 18-19 and Parāśara XII.5-8 prescribe other prāyascittas for such persons (who are styled &lsquo;pratyjavasita&rsquo;). Pr. Prakarana (p. 15 ) and Pr. V. (P. 75 ) quote two verdes of Yama 22la for nine kinds of pratyavasıta and prescribe Candrāyana or two Taptakrcchras for them.</p>
<p>If a ksatriya, vaisya or sūdra intentionally and directly killed a brahmana, the expiation was death, but otherwise each had respectively to undergo twice, thrice or four times as much prāyascitta as a brāhmana sinner would have had to undergo for killing a brahmana,322 Conversely, if a brābmana killed a ksatriya or vaisya or a sūdra the sin was only an upapātaka (acc. to Yāy. II, 236 and Manu XI, 66), unless the ksatriya or vaiśy&amp; victim was engaged in performing a soma sacrifice (Śāmavidhāna Br, I, 7, 5, Yāj. ITI 251, Vas, 20. 34) when the penance was heavy. Yāj. IUI, 266-267, Manu XI, 126-130 and Āp. Dh. S. 1.9.24. 1-4 prescribe other penances for killing a ksatriya, a vaiśya or &amp; sūdra. The penance for a ksatriya</p>

<p>Women victims were placed on the same footing as ksatriya, vaisya and sūdra males (Yāj, III, 236 and Manu XI 66), except the cases where the woman was an Atreyi or pregnant or in her monthly illness (Gaut 22 17, Āp Dh, S. I. 9. 24. 5 and 9, Baud, Dh. &lsquo;S, II, 1.10, 12–13, Vas 20 34, Viṣṇu Dh. S. 50 7-9) or the wife of a twice-born performing a soma sacrifice, when the penance was heavy (like the one for brahmahatya) The period of soma-yāga was reckoned from the Diksaniya isti to the Udavasāniyā (acc to the Mit ) or up to the end of avabhrtha bath (acc. to Apararka). Tor killing women guilty of adultery the ponances were higher and varied according to the caste of the paramour and of the woman (vide Gaut 22.26-27, Manu XI. 138, Yāj III. 268-269).</p>
<p>Manu (XI. 208–Viṣṇu Dh, S 54 30) and Yaj II, 293 prescribe that for threatening to beat or strike a brāhmana the penance is kṛochra, for striking him it is Ati-krochra, for shedd ing his blood a Kr̥cchra and Atikrcchra. The Samaridhāna Br. 1.7. 4 prescribes other penances (i. e. recitation of certain sāman texts) for those.</p>
<p>Gaut. 23.1, 22 Ap Dh S. I 9 25.3, Baud. Dh. S. I. 1. 21., Vas. 20.22, Manu X. 90-91, Yā). II, 253 and Brhaspati prescribe that if a brāhmada drinks intentionally spirituous liquor prepared from flour oven once he has to undergo &amp; PAN ance that ends in death, viz, he has to drink that liquor boiling: hot or to drink boiling hot cow&rsquo;s urine, milk, ghee, water or liquid cow-dung, and when his body has been completely soalded thereby and he dies he becomes free from that sin. Some like Haradatta on Gaut. 23 1 hold that this horrible ponance is meant for one who knowingly and repeatedly drinks sura (man ufactured from rice flour). Manu XL 92 and Yāj. II. 254 prescribe another penance in place of the one ending in death viz, that the sinner should eat during one year (during three</p>

The same rules apply to a ksatriya or vaisya drinking sura (manufactured from rice flour). Only they have as stated above (in nots 192) to undergo three-fourths and one-half respectively of the penance for a brābmapa sinner, This penance was to be undertaken after vomiting the contents of the stomach. According to the Madanapārijāta (p. 818), Pr. V. p 104, Pr Prakarana p. 43, Mit. (on Yāj III. 24) and other works the twelve years&rsquo; penance is meant for one who drinks Surā (made from flour) through ignoranca or forcs. According to Gaut 23, 2-3, Yaj. II 255, Manu, XI, 146, Atri 75, for drink ing intoxicants or human semen, ordure or urine through ignorance a person of the three first classes had first to undergo the panance called Taptakrcchra and then his upanayana was again performed. Vasistha 20.19 prescribes for drinking any intoxicant unintentionally the panances of Kr̥cchra and Atikrochra, the drinking of ghee and the performing of upanayana again. There is great divergence of views about Madu XI, 146 and Yāj III 255 which is passed over here, Brhaspati 224 quoted by the Mit, Aparārka and others prescribes that a brāhmapa who drinks surā prepared from raw sugar, flour and honey (or madhūka flowers) should respectively undergo Taptakrcchra, Parāka and Candrayana. This light penance is restricted acc. to the Mit, and others to cases where suā is drunk for curing a malady which no other medicine could ourd. If a brālmana drank sura (not manufactured from flour) or any other intoxicant, various easy penanons were prescribed for him (such as undergoing Candrāyapa on a river falling into the sea, feeding brāhmanas and donating a cow and a bull to the brābmapas, Parāśara XII 75-76). Vide Yāj. III. 255 and the Mit thereon. Ksatriyas and vaisyas incurred no sin by drinking intoxicants other than sura (made from flour) and the sūdra incurred no sin even by drinking surā of the</p>

The Pr. V (p. 104) and Ps.

<p>Vasistha 20.18 quotes Menu XI, 151 on this point 228 and Viṣṇu (Dh, S. 51.4-5) in prose is to the same effect. Viṣṇu (Dh S&rsquo; 51. 2-3 ) provides Candrayana for drinking any of the (twelve ) unclean excretions of the body (Manu V. 134 ) or any of the several kinds of intoxicating drinks and for eating garlic or onion or red garlic or any plant having a similar flavour or the flesh of village pigs, of fame cooks, of apas and of cows and then adds (in sūtra 4) that they (the sinners) must undergo fresh upangyana also The surtis provide different prāyascittas for various lapses about drinking and eating such as drjnking vater from a pot which had already been used for holding surā, for drinking water from the water vessel of a cāṇḍāla or of a washerman or from a sūdra&rsquo;s house or for drinking milk which should not be drunk (Gaut 17.22-26, Yaj 1.170, Manu V. 8-10), for eating forbidden food, which must be passed over bere, because 229 they are too many and too various and depend on circumstances for their application as observed by the Pr. V and because they are now of academic interest alone. Some reference, however, may be made to show how some of these lapses were treated. Saṅkha states that there are many articles that are allowed or forbidden to men, particularly to brahmanas and in cases of transgressions the decision tests with the sustas (the pareṣad of respectable people). Brhaspati 230 (quoted by Apararka) prescribes that in the case of the partaking of things that should not be licked or drunk or eaten or in case of taking in human semen, urine or ordure, the penance of &amp; cāndrāyana is the purification Some of the sages such as Samyarta, Saṅkha-likhita took a lenient view, prescribed Candrāyada even for eating cow&rsquo;s flesh and human flesh 231</p>

<p>Tho gonoral rule stated by thio Sama Br. I 513, Manu XI, 160 and others is that one dosirous of inner purity should not eat forbiddon food, that if he eats it through ignorance he should make efforts to vomit it and if that is impossible he should quickly take some prāyaścitta (which is slight in the case of ignorance ). It may be montioned that even from very ancient times exceptions were recognised to the prohibitions against the partaking of forbidden food The Chāndogya Upanisad (I, 10 )287 narrates the story of Usasti Cakrāyana, who when the country of tho Kurus had been devastated by hailstones (or by locusts ), begged (along with his very young wife ) of a chief eating boans and took from the latter the beans that had been put away for the chiof (and so were ucchista), but when asked to take water for drinking meant for the chief replied that if he drank of it he would be drinking wliat was unclean, since he could get water whenever he liked. This Vedic passage indicates that oven unclean things may be eaten when there is distress (īpad) or danger to life, but that when there is no distress or danger even one who has knowledge of or ahmavidyā should not violate the injunctions of śāstra about eating. The Vedāntasūtra (III.428) has an aphorism on this incident Manu X.104 provides that he who, when in danger of losing his life, accepts food from any parson whatsoever is not tainted by sin as the sky is not tainted by mua Manu then refers (X 105-108) to the stories of Ajigarta who, when fanished, approached for slaying his own son, of the sage Vāmadeva who when tormented by hunger desired to eat the flesh of a dog in order to save his life and did not sully himself, of Bharadvāja who when distressed by hunger along with his son in a lonely forest accepted many cows from the carpenter Vrdhu (Brbu?) or of Vispāmitra who, well knowing what was right or wrong, proceeded, whon tormented by hunger, to eat the haunch of &amp; dog, receiving it from the hands of a Capdāla 2324</p>

<p>We may not revert to the penances for the other Mahā. pātakas. It has already been seen how the thief that had stolen a brāhmana&rsquo;s gold of a certain weight was to approach the king with a club (p. 73 above). Even Ap.Dh. S, I9,25.4 refers to this and prescribes as an option (Ap Dh. S. 1.9 23.6-7) entering into fira as an expiation for theft or starving oneself by reducing the intake of food. Therefore, the penance for the theft of brahmana&rsquo;s gold of the weight of 80 rahtikās or more (Manu VIII, 134 and Yā] 1,363) was death for the offenders of all varpas, except a brāhmana offender, who clad in rags (or bark garment) was to undergo a penance in a forest for twelve years of the same kind as for brāhmana murder (Manu XI, 101) or for the drinking of salā prepared from flour (Vāj III. 258 ). The offender may also give as much gold (if he is rich) as his own weight or as much wealth as would be required for the maintenance of a brāhmana&rsquo;s family for the latter&rsquo;s lifetime (Yā). III 258 and Mit. thereon) The Āp Dh, S. I. 9 258 provides the observance of the penance of Kr̥cchra for one year (as defined in Āp Dh. S I 9 27 7–8) and quotes a verse &lsquo;&rsquo;those who have committed a theft (of gold), drunk spirituous liquor, or had connection with a guru&rsquo;s wife, but not those who have slain a brāhmaua, shall eat every fourth meal-tinje a little food, bathe thrice a day, pass the day standing and the night sitting; after the lapse of three years they cast off their sins.&ldquo;2325 The digests contain numerous and varying expiations for theft depending upon the weight of gold stolen, upon the qualities of the man robbed and of the thief, upon the caste of both, upon whether it is a first offence or a repeated one, on the price and natura of the thing stolen and on the time and place and so on Vide Pr V. pp. 117-127, Pr. Sāra p 49, Madanapīrijāta pp 828-834, Smrtyarthasāra pp. 108-109, Smrtimuktāphala pp 883-885. These have to be passed over here for reasons of space.</p>

<p>or any other non-brahmana, the expiation would be as one for an upapātaka Manu (XI 162&ndash;168 =Matsyapurana 227, 41-47) and Viṣṇu 52. 5-13 prescribe various penances such as krochra for a year for the theft of corn or cooked food or wealth; cāndrāyana for abducting men and women (slaves) or for appropriating a field or liouse and the water of wells and cisterns; santapana for thefts of objects of small value; pancagavya for stealing eatables of various kinds or a vehicle or a bed or a seat or flowers or roots and fruits, fasting for three days and nights in the case of theft of grass, food, trees, dry food, molasses, clothes, leather (or armour) and flesh, subsisting for twelve days on small grains of rice for stealing gems, pearls, coral, copper, silver, iron, bell-retal or stones, subsisting on milk alona for the theft of cotton, silk, vool, animals with cloven hoofs (cows &amp;c.) or uncloven hoofs (horses &amp;c), birds, perfumes, medicinal herbs or a rope (used for drawing water). It must be remembered as stated above (p. 74) that the thief had to restore to the owner the thing stolen and then undergo a penance (Manu XI.164 and Visou Dh S 58.14) and Medhātithi (on Manu XI. 164) adds that if he is unable to restore the thing (or its price) the penance is to be double. Besides, in certain cases of theft if corporal punishment or death was not inflicted by the king, the thief vas fined eleven times the price of the thing stolen (Manu VIII, 321, 323, Vienu Dh S. 5,82) 233</p>
<p>Steija (theft) is of two kinds, by force (such as robbery and dacoity and called sālasa) and by clandestine means. In the fornier case the penance goes on increasing (twice, thrice) according as the offender is a ksatriya or raiśya (parsadya brālimanūnūn, quoted above, Par. M. I part 1 p.231) In the Cuse of theft by clandestine means if the owner wliose gold or wealth is stolon is a brahmana and the thief a ksatriya or vaisya, then also the penance must be bigher than for a brāhmana thjef (since, as, Nārada says in his chapter on sāhasa verse 16, the pealth belonging to idols, brāhmapas and kings is the bast) But conversely, if the owner of stolen property is of lower class than the thiof then the verse of Brhad-Vignu (&lsquo;vipre tu sakalam deyam,&rsquo; quoted above in note 192) will apply.</p>

<p>Penance for incest</p>
<p>103</p>
<p>become three are no hot iron im penance. There penance cream</p>
<p>The penance for incest with the guru&rsquo;s wife was prescribed from very ancient tines as follows: Gaut. 234 23, 8-11, Ap. Dh. S. 1.9.25.1-2, Baud, Dh. S. II. 1. 14-16 (almost in the same words as in Gaut), Vas. 20. 13-14, Manu XI. 103-104 prescribe that the offender shall confess his guilt and then extend himself on a red-hot iron bed or embrace the red-lot iron image of a woman or having himself cut off his organ and testicles and having taken them in his joined hands may walk straight towards the south or south-Test until he falls down dead and that he becomes purified by death. According to the Mit, on Yāj. TIL 259 the three are not distinct penances, but that two of them, viz, embracing the red-hot irou image of a woman and sleeping on a bed of red hot iron form one penance. The words of Yāj. no doubt contey that the two together are one penance ( viz. sleeping on red hot bed and clinging to a red hot image ). Others like the Madanapārijāta. (p. 837), Medhātithi 235 on Manu XI. 103 do not accept this interpretation. The latter moreorer relies on Gautama who employs the word &lsquo;ya&rsquo; (or) in the two latter of his three sūtras on this point, The Pr. V. (p. 138) points out this difference between Gaut. and Yāj. Manu XI. 58 and 170–71, Yāj. N. 231, Samyarta 159 regard sexual intercourse with a friend&rsquo;s wife or a maiden of a higher caste and the wives of one&rsquo;s son or of sagotras and women born of the same womb (sister &amp;c.) or with an antyaja Voman as equal to gurutalpagamana and the penance is only a little less than for the latter. Manu XI. 103 and Yā). III. 260 prescribe a penance (other than one ending in death), viz. that the singer should dwell in a tenantless forest, allow his beard to grow, should trear tattered garments and practise Prājāpatya Kpochra for one year (tliree years acc. to Yāj.). The commentators say that this was meant where the sin pas committed by mistake, Manu XI. 106 and Yāj. IL 260 provide another penance viz. Cāndrāyana for three inonths, Manu prescribing that the sinner should subsist on sacrificial food (fruits, roots or nivõra grain) or on barley gruel and Yāj. adding that he should recite for the three months the Vedasambit. The commentators say that this applies in casos khera the guru&rsquo;s wife is of a lower yarna or of the sūdra class,</p>

<p>[Vol. Parāgara (X 10-11) provides three different prāyascittas, viz. excision of the organ, three hrochu as or three cāndı āyanas if a man commits incest with his mother, sister, or daughter and in X. 12-14 prescribes other penances for adultery with other near female relatives The Mit on Yā). III 259 quotes Saṅkha for twelve years&rsquo; penance for all four kinds of Mahāpātakas, which applies acc to it to intercourse with guru&rsquo;s wife of the same class. It is not necessary to quote further smrti passages which vary greatly as to the extent of the penance Manu XI 178(= Vispu Dhs 53. 9 = Agnipurāna 169 41), Santi 165 29 state that the sin which a twice-born man com mits by sexual intercourse for one night with a vr̥ṣalī 236 (a cāṇḍāla woman) is removed by him by the penance of subsist ing on almos for three years and reciting mantras (like the Gāyatri). Āp. Dh S. I 9 27. 11 has a somewhat similar verse about a brāhmana&rsquo;s intercourse with a śūdra woman237. Yaj III, 233 prescribes for women death as a legal penalty and the same prāyaścitta as for a male if a man has sexual intercourse with his paternal or maternal aunt, or daughter-in-law, matei nal uncle&rsquo;s wife and others ( enumerated above) with their consent Manu XI, 175 (= Laghu-Satātapa 155 = Agaipurāda 169 38) holds that a brāhmana, who has sexual intercourse with a cāṇḍāla woman or mleccha woman or dines with candālas or mlecchas or accepts gifts from them, has to perform penance ag if he were patta if he unknowingly did these things, and be comes like them by committing thesa sins knowingly Coni pare Vasistha 23 41, Visvu Dh.

<p>If a wonian be guilty of a Mahāpātaka the general rule stated by Manu XT 176 (latter half), Kātyāyana and Brhaspatı23 was that whatever penance was prescribed for a male in casos of adultery with other&rsquo;s wives the same was to be adminis tered to women in case of adultery with males.

<p>Prāyaścitta for adulteress</p>
<p>105</p>
<p>cular case the rule about half panance being prescribed for women did not hold good when a woman with full knowledge committed adultery and half panance was to be prescribed only where the adultery was through mistake, A. similar rule was laid down by Angiras 23. If a woman became patita and did not undergo frīgaścitta she could be excommunicated by the process called ghatasphota (described in&rsquo;H. of Dh, vol. III pr. 615-616 and 1009). But there was a difference between a male and a woman in this respact. A wawan, however, was not to be altogether abandoned on the street and left to fare for herself, though she be patita, but she was to be lodged in a cottage thatched with grass near the house and was to be guarded against further lapses and given bare maintenance ( enough to keep body and soul together) and (dirty) clothes (Yā), IL 296, Manu XI. 176). Thera vera certain acts, however, which were specially condemned in women (Vāj. III, 297) viz, sexual intercourse with a man of a lower class, causing abortion and killing the husband. Vas. 21, 10 provides 339 that four olasses of women may be altogether abandoned (and not given even starving maintenance &amp;c) viz, a woman who has sexual intercourse with her husband&rsquo;s) pupil or with his guru or one who kills her husband or one who sexually approaches a man of a lower degraded class. Women, however patita they may be, were to be dealt with as stated in Yāj. II 296 even if they did hot perform any penance Vas. 21.12 states that women of the brahmana, ksatriya and Taiśya classes, if guilty of sexual intercourse with a śūdra, can be purified by penanos if they do not give birth to a child, but not those others (who give birth to a child born of the condemned connection). Vida H. of Dk, vo). III. pp. 946-949 for penance and other matters in relation to adultery by men and women.</p>
<p>It is now necessary to turn to the penance for association with those that are guilty of grave sins (rahāpatakas), Manu XT. 181, Visou Db, S. 54 1, Yay. III 261 provide that whoever associates with (for a year, acc. to Yāj.) a person guilty of one</p>

If the association Tas for less than one year, then the penance was proportionatels reduced, Not only was the patita condemned but even his son born after he became patta and he was excluded from inheritance. But the daughter of a patita was treated differently and she could be married without any stigma being attached to the husband, Vide Vas, 13 51-53, Yā), III, 261, Baud Dh.

<p>The penances for upapātahas must now be briefly dealt with. The number of apapatakas is very large and it is of no practical importance to deal with each of them separatels First of all, some general rules about them will be stated and</p>

<p>Penances for upapātakas</p>
<p>&amp; few of them that are of some importance will be dealt with individually. The Samaridhāna 243 Br. (L 5.14) states that on committing several upapātakas a man becomes pure by reciting thrice the whole of the veda while fasting. Manu XI. 117, Yāj. IIL 265, Viṣṇu Dh, S. 37 35 prescriba that purification from all classes of upapātakas (except the sin of the avalcīrnin) is effected by the same penances that are prescribed for govadha or by cāndrāyana or by subsisting on milk alone for a month or by Parāka or Gosava. The digests prescribe that Parāka is meant for him who is strong enough to undertake it, Cāndrāyana for him who is weak, Gosava for him who repeatedly commits the same upapātaka or is guilty of several at the same time (vide Pr. Prakāśa, folio 12% a).</p>
<p>Govadha stands at the head of upapātakas in Manu, Yāj., the Agnipurāna (168 29-37). Several smrtis provide different penances for the sin of killing a cow. Gaut, 22.18 prescribes244 the same penance for govadha as for killing a paisya (Gaut. 22. 15) viz. staying for three years in a forest, subsisting on alms, observing celibacy and donating one hundred cows toge ther with a bull. In Āp. Dh, S. 1. 9. 26. 1 for killing a milch OOW or a full grown ox the penance is said to be the same as for killing a śūdra Vas, 21. 18 provides that if a man kills a Gow he should cover himself with the raw bide of the cow (that is killed) and should observe Kr̥cchra or Atikrochra for six months. Manu 245 XI, 108-116, Vispu Dh. S, 50, 16-24, Sam Varta 130-135, Parāśara VII. 31-41 (q. in Smrtimuktāphala p. 875, prāyaścitta section) prescribe elaborate observances as penances for govadha Yāj. (IIL 263–264) provides four sepa rate prāyasoittas, viz (1) the killer of a cow should control his senses for a month, should subsist on pascagavya (cow&rsquo;s urine, cow-dung, milk, curds and ghee), should sleep in a cowpon, should follow the cows so penned (by day) and at the end of a month donate a cow; (2) or he should perform Kr̥cchra penance while sleeping in a cow-pon and following cows by day; (3) or should perform an alkrochra in the same way; (4) or should fast for three days and donate tan cows together with</p>

Some of the smrtis and digests declare that the penance differed according as the cow that was killed belonged to a learned brāhmana or to a mere brāhmana by caste, to a ksatriya or vaisya or sūdra For example, Davala (q. by Pr. V. p 202) states that if a cow belonging to a brah mapa were killed, then the sinner should wear as upper garment that cow&rsquo;s hide for six months, should bring fodder for cows, should imitate cows, should subsist on barley gruel, should move among cows and then he becomes free fion the sin, Sātātapa (q. by Pr V. p 203) states that one kıllıng the cow of a yaisya should subsist on pañcagavya for a month, should recite the Gomati-vidya 217 and stay in a cowpen for a month, Viśva mitra (Pr. V. p 203) says about the killer of a cow belonging to a sūdra that he should undergo four krochras if he kills intentionally and two if unintentionally. The Gomati-vidyā as quoted by Aparārka (p. 1102), the Madana-pārijāta (p. 862) and Pr T. p 522 (which takes it from the Prāyaścitta section of the Kalpataru that takes it from Yama) is a laudation of cows: &lsquo;cows always emit fragrance, they liave the sinell of guggulu (bdellium), they are the support of beings, they are a great blessing, cows are (yield in their milk) the best food and the best offerings for gods; they are purifiers of all beings and offerings ooze from them; they please the gods in heaven by the offerings (of milk and ghee) that are rendered pure by the mantras recited over them; in the agnihotra (keeping up the sacred fire) of sages cows help</p>

Dh S (I 9.25.14) provides for killing a crow, a chameleon, &amp; peacock, a chaki avāka, hamsa, bhāsa, a frog, ichneumon, musk-rat, a dog the same penance as for killing a sūdra Gaut 22 19-22, 24–25, Manu XI. 133-137, Yā) III. 269-274, Viṣṇu Dh, $ 50,25-32, Parāśara VL 1-15 prescribe several ponances for killing an elephant, &amp; horse, a tiger, a monkey, a cat, a serpant and numerous other animals, whioh are passed over here Some smrtis such as Samyarts 10 and Paithinasi make a difference between grāmya and aranya (forest) animals, in each class seven being specificed by Paithidasi 21 The great concern of the sages for anything possessed of the principle of life or growth went so far as to prescribe the ponance of reciting one hundred rk verses if a man cut off big trees (like mango or jack-fruit tree) or shrubs and creepers, except for purposes of sacrifices or agriculture 252 (Manu XI. 142, Yāy TIL 276, Vas 19. 11-12). These provisions tended against wanton destruction of trees, shrubs and forests that are so beneficent to humanity and lend a charm to the landscape,</p>
<p>It is remarkable that in case a man was bitten by a harlok or a monkey or an ass or by a dog or jackal or a camel or a crow he had to perform (in addition to the pain of the bite) prānāyāna while standing in water and to drink ghee for purification (Manu XI. 199, Yā). III. 277, Vas 23, 31) Paraśara V 1-9 prescribe elaborate rules of purification for bites by wolves, doga and jackals (such as a bath and Japa of Gāyatri &amp;c).</p>
<p>PARADARYA (adultery with another&rsquo;s wife)-is a minor sin (acc to Yāj III, 235, Manu XT. 59). This excludes inter course with guru&rsquo;s wife and other intercourse declared to be like gurutal pagamana or with candāla women (Mapu XI. 170-17%, 175, 178, Yaj III 231-233, Vas XX. 15-17 and XXI, 41) Ap.

III, 265 quotes numerous texts dealing with the penanc for adultery that does not amount to a mahāpātaka and tries to evolve order by assigning to each its proper province. This is passed over here. A woman guilty of adultery with a male of the saine or higher caste than herself had to undergo the same penance as a malo adulterer (Manu XI 176 and Bphaspati), but if she committed adultery with a male of lower caste, then the penances differed as stated above (vide Vas, 21, 1-5 and Sarvarta 167-172), Brhadyama IV.48 states that adultery in the inverse order of olasses is a grave sin, but adultery in the anuloma order of classes entails different penances for purification from it.253</p>
<p>Vrātyatā (failure to have upanayapa performed at the right time) person whose upanayana is not performed at the proper time is called vrātya or patitasāvitriha. Vide Asv. gr. I 19. 5-7, Ap Dh.

XI. 76-79, Gaut. 198) are prescribed by some of these works, while Mann XI. 191 (=Visdu Dh, S. 54, 26-27=Agni purāna 170.8-9) prescribes a milder penance of three krochias and then Upanayana is to be performed again. Vas. XI. 77 describes Uddalakavrata as follows: &lsquo;for two months he should subsist on barley gruel, for a month on milk, for half a month on āmiksā, for eight days on ghee, for six days on food obtained without begging or asking for it, for three days on vater and he should observe a complete fast for one day.&rsquo; Ap.

<p>If an ascetic reverted to the life of a householder, Samyaita (171-172) prescribes the penance of krcchra for six months 257, Such a man is called pratyavasıta. The pratyavasitas are said to be of nine kinds 258 by Yama (22-23), Bșhad-Yaba (3-4) and others viz, those who turn back from water, fire, halter by means of which they wanted to kill themselves), those who revert back from the stage of sannijāsa or from a fast (unto death), or from poison, precipice or sitting dharna and those who (desiring to coinmit suicide) strike themselves with a weapon (but are not killed), these pine are called pratyavasıta and are beyond commerce with people, become pure by the penance of Candrāyana or two Taplakrcchras. Vrddha-Parāśara quoted by Par. M, and Prayascitta-inuktāvali provides that sandyāsins, who revert to the life of the householder, are to be treated as cāṇḍālas even after undergoing penance and their children born after they fall from the fascetic stage are to be made to dwell among cāndalas. This explains the harsh treatinent alleged to have been meted to the great saint Jñanośvara and his brothers at Paithan in the 13th century.

<p>Elaborate purifications are prescribed for renioving the tait of touching ceitain men, unclean objects like bones (Manu V. 87), women in their monthly illness or within certain days alter delivery and animals (like dogs, village pigs, cocks, crows). They have to be passed over here for reasons of space. But a feir passages may be cited by way of sample. Gautama 253 (14,38) provides that on touching palta, cāṇḍāla, a woman fresh) delivered, a woman in her monthly illness, a corpse, or on touch ing any one who has touched any one of these or any one who is the third in contact, the purification is brought about by a bath with the clothes on. Maru V. 81 and Yāj III 30 contain similar provisions The Pr. V. (pp. 495–199) discusses the question whether spar sa 260 (touch) means direct touch or includes even indirect touch and ultimately arrives at the conclusion that indirect touch also is included and cites Āpastanla-smrti in support that if a brāhmana and a candāla or the lıke aro both seated on the seme branch (without actually touching each other) the brāhmana can become purified only by a bath. A rerse quoted as Yājāavalkya&rsquo;s by Pr. Prakarana 351 p. 110 (not found in the printed text) states. &lsquo;on touching a cāṇḍāla, pukkass, mleocha, bhilla, a pārasika (one coming from Persia) and the like and persons guilty of grave sins one should bathe with the clothes on.&rsquo; The Sat-trimsan-mata262 provides &lsquo;on toucbing</p>

<p>115 Bath for fouching certain persons</p>
<p>Bauddhas, Pasupatas, Laukāyatikas, atheists and those who follow forbidden aotions, one should plunge in water together with the clothes on. On touching a cartya tree (such as a sig tree round which a platform is built), a funeral pile (or brick altar prepared in the srauta rits called Agnicayana), a sacrificia) post, a cāṇḍāla, one who sells the soma plant, a brāhmana should enter water with the clothes on.&rsquo; Samyarta 263 requires a drija to sip water on touching a shoemaker, a washerman, a zena (Manu X 19, 49, one who beats drum &amp;c.), a fisherman, a dancer (nata) and Sātātapa 26 provides that if any liub of a duija (except the head) is touched by one who colours clothes, a shoemaker, a hunter, a fisherman, a washerman, a butcher, a thaha (Thug), an actor, one who allows sexual intercourse in the mouth, a dog, a prostitute allowing men of all varpas to visit her, an oil-grinder, the keeper of a tavern, an executioner, a village pig or cock, he should wash the limb with water and perform ācamana. If the head is touched by any one of these, then he should bathe. In this connection it may be noted that Hemādri quotes (on p. 38) the Garuḍapurāna and (on p. 316) Parāśara for the 16 castes in a village that were treated as cāndalas jn the matter of touch, speech or sight. Devala (q. by Hemādri on prāyaścitta p. 312) says that Capdāla and Turuska (Turk) are equally low. The chapter on untouchables in the 2nd rol. of the H. of Dh pp. 165–179 may be consulted in this connection. On pp. 175-176 of the same work references are given to verses of Atri, Satātapa, Brhaspati and others stating that no purification is required on the ground of untouchability in the case of religious festivals and marriage processions, in hattle, in the case of fire or invasion and similar calamities. By po stretch of imagination can these verses be restricted to the untouchability arising from death or birth as some propose</p>

<p>One important matter dealt with by a few of the smrtis and some of the digests is the re-admission into the Hindu fold of those who were converted by force by the invading mlecchas. About the ineaning of the word mleccha, there is some diver gence of views. From the Sat. Br. (IHL. 21 23-24) it appears that the mlecchas spoke a degraded and corrupt speech ( such as saying &ldquo;helavah&rsquo; for &lsquo;hesrayah&rsquo;). Parasara (IX. 36) refers to the mlecchas as the eaters of cow&rsquo;s flesh. The Pr. T. (p 549) quotes a smrti 265 text to the effect that a mlecoha is an eater of Cow&rsquo;s flesh and talks much that is contradictory, and cites a passage from the Harivamsa for the manner of the dress and of the trimming of hair in the case of Sakas, Yavanas, Kambojas, Pāradas, Pablayas &amp;c. Vide for mleccha and for the return to the Hindu fold of those that ware forcibly carried away as slaves by mlecchas and robbers or made to kill cows or to eat the flesh of asses, camels, village pigs, H. of Dh. vol.

S. VII 6-7, Yāj II 89 declare that what is given by force, what is enjoyed by force and what is caused to be written by force and all transactions whatever that are brought about by force are void, and the burning desire of many people forcibly converted in times of disturbances to return to the Hindu sold and to the religion of their forefathers, the movement now called suddhi should be encouraged by all interested in the well-being and stability of Hindu society It is better to call this return by the name of parāvartana&rsquo;. A model but brief rite for the par āvar tana of those who were forcibly converted or for those who voluntarily left the Hindu fold but want to return to it is given in the Appendix The same prayoga with suitable changes may be employed for taking into the Hindu fold any one who was not born a Hindu. In ancient times such people appear to have been taken into the Hindu fold by the perfor mance of Vrūtyastoma.

<p>Penances for miscellaneous lapses</p>
<p>days Those two verses of Manu occur in Agnipurāna (170. 23-25). Vispu Dh. 8. (39,2, 40.2, 415) prescribas somewhat different penances for sankarikarana, apātrikarana or malini karapiya deeds Vide also the Mit on Ya) III, 290 for the penances prescribed for these deeds by Yama and Brhaspati, About miscellaneous pūtahas the rule laid down by Manu XI, 209, Vispu Dh S 422, Yā). III 294 and others is that the penance should be prescribed by the brahmanas after taking into account the nature of the deed, the ability of the perpetrator and other circumstances of time and place &amp;c.</p>
<p>Some of the digests prescribe certain times for the perform ance of penance. The first rule is laid down by Harita that having done something sinful or improper through trustfulness, affection, greed, fear or heedlessness one should resort to puri fication at once Daksa268 11. 73 also states that all narmadhika and kāmya matters must be performed as they fall due and no delay should be caused. If more than a year is allowed to pass after the sin is incurred the penance vould have to be double of what it otherwise would have been, according to Davala and Manu.26BIT The Pr. T. (pp 474,512) quotes a perse from the Vyavahāra cintamani 269 and an astrological work to the effect that a penance or ordeal should not be administered on the 8th or 14th tithr of a month, nor should an ordeal or marriage take place on a Saturday or Tuesday. The Prayascittendusekhara (P 15) says that according to respectable people (śrstas) the saṅkalpa (declaration of undergoing a penance) should be made on the 14th titiu and the actual rite should be performed on the amīvūsyā. If the guilty person is in mourning he may perform penance after the period of mourning is over.</p>

<p>the method of performing Kr̥cchra penance It is briefly as follotts: The sidder desiring to be free of sin quickls should stand by day and sit up by night (i e. should take sleep in a sitting position and not lie down), he should speak the truth and should not hold conversation with anārijas (sūdras &amp;c), should bathe thrice in the day, should perform mārjana (splash ing or sprinkling water on the head and other limbs by means of kuśas dipped in ater after repeating sacred mantras) Frith the three verses &lsquo;āpo hi sthā&rsquo; (Rg. X,9.1–3), with the perses called Pavitrarati and with the eight Terses beginning with ‘hirapfararpah sucayaḥ pārakāh&rsquo; (Tai. S 1.6 1.1-8) Then he should perform the tru pana 270 (satiating with water) with thirteen mantras beginning with namah and ending with namah (each respectirely containing 6, 4, 4, 13, 2, 2, 2, 6, 5, 7, 2, 6, names of deities) This constitutes for him the worship of Aditya (the Sun) and be offers oblations of clarified butter with these thirteen mantras and, after he passes twelve days in this vay, on the 13th he offers nine oblations of boiled rice to Agni, Soma, Agni and Soma, Indra and Agni, Indra, the Price Darvas, Brahman, Prajāpati, Agni Syistakrt Then he serres dinner to brābmadas The Āp. Dh. S II, 6 15.9 states 21 the general rule that in a]] religious observances one should give dinner to brāhmadas that are pure (in conduct) and that hare studied the Veda. The Baud Dh S. (I. I. 95-99) prescribes that in a krcchra penance one has to bathe thrice in the day, to jie dorsa on the ground (not on a cot &amp;c), to rear only one piece of cloth, to shave one&rsquo;s hair on the head, the moustache and the body and to pare one&rsquo;s nails, and that the same mode is prescribed also for women (sinners) except the topsure of the head Manu (XI. 222-225) prescribes that in all penances there is homa Tith the malāryābrtis erery day, the singer has to practise ahinsa (non-injury to all sentient beings), truthfulness, absence of anger and straight-forwardness, has to bathe thrice by day and thrica by night together with the clothes on, he should not talk with women, sūdras and patitas, he should stand by day and sit down at night or if unable to do so he should sleep on the ground (raised platform called sthandila), should observe celibacy and the rules of a student, such as wearing girdle of nunja grass and carrying 3 staff (of palāśa &amp;c), should honour gods, brāhmanas and his elders, should always recite the Gāyatri and sacred testa.</p>

<p>Procedure of penances</p>
<p>121</p>
<p>Vas, 24.5 (a long prose passage) contains similar provisions. Yaj II, 312-13 are very important. They prescribe the practice of certain virtues and rules of conduct called yamas (such as brahmacaryja, kindliness, forbearance, truthfulness, ahinsa &amp;c.) and nyamas (such as bath, silenc3, fasting, purity of body &amp;c.) as necessary adjuncts in all penances. The Laugāksigihya (V. 3-11) prescribes the procedure for all penances Yāj. IL, 325 holds that one should, while performing the penance of krcchra or cāndrāyapa, bathe thrice daily, recite holy mantras (as stated in Vas 28.11-15) and should eat balls of rica over which the Gāyatri has been recited, Saṅkha272 (18.12-14) also summarises the different items that have to be gone through in undergoing &amp; penance The Madanapārijāta (pp 781-784), Pr. V. (Pp 503 506), Pr. Sāra (pp 21,22 and 200-203), Pr. T. pp. 497-510, 523-524, Pr. Mayūkha pp. 18-21, Pr. Prakasa (folios 38b to 43b), Prāgascittendusekhara (pp. 15 and 88) and other works provide elaborate rules about the procedure of undergoing prayascittas. It is not possible nor necessary to set out these in detail here. Briefly put, on the day previous to the actual day of commencing panance the sinner should pareʻhis nails, shave his head, bathe with clay, cow-dung, holy water &amp;c, drink clarified butter, make a declaration of performing the penance indicated by the assembly of learned men. On the next day he should bathe, perform śrāddha, drink pancagavya, should perform homa, give dalıṣınā (gold, cows &amp;c.) to the brāhmadas and feed them. Parāśara (XI. 3) says that at the end of the rite of penance pañca gayya should be taken and one, two, three or four cows should be donated respectively by a brāhmana, a ksatriya, a vaiśya and a sūdra. Yama (verse 63) says that brāhmadas should be fed on the performance of a penance and a daksidā of one golden māsa should be given to each brāhmana, Jābali says that at the beginning and close of all penances the sinner should offer in the smārta fire oblations of clarified butter to the accompani ment of the Vyāhrtis, perform śrāddha and offer daksınā con sisting of a cow or gold. Vide Aparārka (p. 1230) and Par. - 1 I part 2 p, 195 for Jābāli&rsquo;s verses. The Pr Prakāśa (folio 30a) adds that according to the Mahārnaya the number of tūlirli-homas should be 28 or 108.</p>

<p>History of Dhar maśāstra</p>
<p>[Vol. A few words may be said about the tonsure of the head (vapana or mundana). The Tai Br (15 6.1-2) states273 &ldquo;The Asuras first shaved the hair on the head, then the moustache and then the armpits, therefore they went down (or with face down. wards) and were defeated, while the gods first shaped the armpits, then the moustache and then the hair on the head&rsquo; The Pr Prakaśa quotes this passage in a mutilated form and then states that vapana is of three kinds, darva (of the gods), ūsura (of the asuras) and mānusa (of men), that the asura method is condemned, that in consecrating the Vedic fires, in the zśtis and soma sacrifices the daiva method is ordained, while in prāyaścıttas, there being no special vidhi, there is an option. Tonsure of the head is enjoined on several occasions e, g. the Vispupurāna provides 274 &lsquo;Tonsure should be carried out at Prayaga when on a pilgrimaga, and on the death of one&rsquo;s father or mother, one should not in vain (lightly ) tonsure the head&rsquo;. To these occasions may be added penances. The idea seems to have been entertained that whataver sin a man commits it becomes centered in the hair, as a verse quoted by the Madanapārijāta and Pr M. states Is Gaut. (273), Vas.76 (245), Baud. Dh. S. (II.1.98-99) and others provide for the tonsure of the hair on the head and lips (except those on the eye-brows, the hair on the trunk and the top knot ). Exceptions were introduced to the rule about tonsure Daksa277 forbade tonsure, the offering of pindas and the carrying of a corpse and all funeral rites to</p>

<p>Tonsire in penances</p>
<p>123</p>
<p>one those father was alive and to a man whose wife was pregnant. But this prohibition did not apply to penances. The Baud, Dh s already referred to prohibits the tonsurs of Fomen in penancos Angiras 163, Āpastanuba-smrti I. 33–34. Brhad-Yama IV.16, Vrddha-Hārita IX 386, Parāśara IX, 54-55, Yama 54-55 provide 278 that in the case of married women whose husbands are alive and in the case of maidens all their hair should be held together and only two finger-breadths of hair should be cut off, In the case of widows and ascetics the entire Head vas to be shared. It was further provided by Parāśara (IX 52-54), Saṅkha (q. by Par. M. I. part I, pp. 290-291) that in the case of a king or prince or a learned brābmapa tonsure of the head should not be insisted upon, but that they should have to undergo double the usual penance and the dahsinā would have to be double, 239 The Mit, on Yāz. II. 325 quotes a verse of Manu 230 (not found in the printed text) &rsquo;tonsure of the head is not desired in the case of learned brāhmanas and kings except in the case of those guilty of mahāpātakas, of cow-killing of of being ad avahirnin&rsquo;. The Mit. (on Yaj. III 264) further quotes Samyarta 251 to the effect that when the penance prescribed is only a quarter then only the hair on the body below the throat is to be shared, when half is prescribed then in addition the hair on the lips is to be cut, when three-fourths then all the bair on the body except the knot is to be cut and in the case of the full penance all hair including the śikna (the top-knot) also are to be cut off. The Par, M (II part 1. p 300) while describing cāndrāyada penance requires the cutting of the hair on all parts</p>

<p>I Vol. of the body (including private parts), 282 The tonsure is to be performed by a barber and yet the sanhalpa is &lsquo;vapanam karisye&rsquo; and not &lsquo;vapanam kārayisye&rsquo; From Gaut 27.3 (vapanam vratam caret) prescribing tonsure in cāndrāyana Haradatta and others infer that zapano is unnecessary in krcchra pedance</p>
<p>Baths that are subsidiary to prāyascitta are performed with ashes, cowdung, clay, water, pañcagavya and water in which kusa grass has been dipped Mantras that are to be recited at the time of bath aro laid down in the Linga-piirāna, the Bhaviṣyapurāna and elsewhere,</p>
<p>Thcra are certain virtues to be cultivated as being common to all prāyascittas whether secretly or openly undergone They are called vamas and niyamas and have been set out abovo (121) from Yāj III. 312-313 Atri (versos 48-49) sets them out somewhat differently. Manu IV, 204 (= Atri verse 47 ) refers to yamas and niyamas which Medhātithi explains as follows. viz yamas are in the nature of prohibitions (e. g. a biāhmada should not be killed), while niyamas consist of what is to be done (such as one Bhould always recite the Veda, as in Manu IV. 147).</p>
<p>While undergoing prayascittas certain rules about food and other matters were to be observed. For example, Hārita 28 prescribes that the person undergoing penance should omit all days māsa and masūra pulse, honey, taking food at the house of or belonging to others and sexual intercourse, should not speak at an improper time, should perform ūcamana if he speaks with women or sūdras or those who are ucclusta Yama ordains that one who is undergoing a penance should omit massaging the body or head with oil, the chewing of tõmbula, applying unguents and every thing else that causes one to feel strength or sexual passion.</p>
<p>According to the Pr 781 Prakāśa when undertaking &amp; penance one should begin with the mantra * Agne vratapata</p>

<p>Prāgascittas are of two kinds, prakāśa (undergone openly ) and rahasya (undergone secretly). A few words must be said about the latter, Gaut. ( 241-11), Vas. (251-3), Manu XI. 248–265, Yāj. IIL, 301-303, Viṣṇu Dh. S. 55 and other smrtis lay down rules about secret prāyaścittas, Where a man&rsquo;s 285 sin is not known to anyone except himself he may perform secret expia tion. In the case of adultery and in the case of association with one guilty of a grave sin, ono may still perform a secret penance, even though the adultery is known to the adulteress and even though the man guilty of &amp; mahāpātaka is aware of the association, Vas.286 25 % states the general rule that secret penances are meant for those who have consecrated the Vedic fires, who are disciplined, old or learned and that the openly undergone penances are meant for others. If such &amp; man is himself aware of the proper podance, he should perform it with out going to an assembly ( parṣad ), but if he is not so aware he may consult some knowing pareon privately, asking him in a general way what the penance for a particular sin may be Vas, 25.3 provides that those who are always intent on prānāyāmas, holy texts, gifts, homas and japa are released from sin, Manu XI.226 states that those whose sins have not become public may be purified by homes and mantras. Even women and sūdras can perform penance in secret, since, though they cannot garform liomz and repeat Vedic mantras, they can, as the Mit on Yāj III.300 says, perform expiation by means of gifts and prānāyāmas. Gaut 26 % and Manu XI. 253 proscribe that one who desires to receive a gift which he should not accept or who receives such a gift should recite in water (navel-deep according to some) the hymn of four verses beginning with &rsquo;tarat</p>

<p>sa mandi&rsquo; (Rg 8,581-7). For ong who is guilty of brāhinana murder Gaut. (246) prescribes that for the first ten days be should subsist on mık alone, on clarified butter for a further ten days, on water for another period of ten days, that he should partake of the articles specified only once in the worning, should wear wet clothes and should offer every day night symbolic homas with clarified butter, of his hair on the body, nails, skin, flesh, blood, muscles, bones and marron with the words &lsquo;I offer in the mouth of Death&rsquo; added at the end, 257 Yā] II(301 prescribes that the murderer of a brāhmana should fast for ten days, should reoita the Aghamarsana hymn (R&amp; X190) while submerged in water, donate a cow yielding milk, while Visou prescribes that he should bathe for a month in a flowing stream or river, should perform every day 16 prādāyāmas, should eat oply once a day sacrificial food and may then become purified. Visou provides that the drinker of surā becomes pure by observing the viata ( as stated) for brāhmana murder and reciting Aghamarsada; while the thief of brahmana&rsquo;s gold becomes pure by fasting for three days and reciting the sacred Gāyatri ten thousand times and one guilty of incest by the repeated recital of the hymn beginning with &lsquo;sahasrasīrsa&rsquo; (Rg X. 90).</p>
<p>The sages observed that some of the pedances mentioned in old sortis were terrible and inyolved loss of life Therefore, gradually more humane and easier penances came to be prescribed For example, Harita 28 states brāhmanas ho have studied dharmaśāstra should prescribe a pedance appro priate to the age, the time and the strength of the brāhmada (sidder), tha penance being such that he may not lose his life and yet may be purified; one should not presoribe an observance that will cause great distress ( to the sidder) Ažgiras also says that the par ṣad should indicate the penance resolved upon by all the menubers which would not cause loss of life Saṅkha</p>

<p>As times changed easier substitutes (called palyāmnayas) were found and prescribed The word pratyāmnaga was used in this sense in the Ap. Sr, S. V. 20,18 (yadyanadhyo-gnin ādadhīta kāmam-eyaikām gām dadyāt sā gavām pratyāmnāyo bhayatīti vijñāyate), 6 309 and San. Sr. S. 1451.6 and other sūtras Samayarta, 290 states that if a sinner is unable to undergo the Prājāpatya penance, he may donate instead a cow yielding milk and if he cannot donate such a cow he may donate the full price of such a cow, Parāśara 2942 (XI 63–64) provides four substitutes for a Prājāpatya, penanca viz the recital of the famous Gayatri mantra (Rg. II, 62 10) ten thousand times or 200 prādāyāmas, or bathing twelve times in a sacred watery place after drying the head on each bath, or taking to a journey of two yojanas towards a holy place. From the words of Gaut. 19 16 and 18 (quoted above in note 120) it follows that gold is a substitute for a cow by way of penance.

<p>or a quarter niska may be given The Caturvimśatimata 293 provides several pratyāmnāyas for Prājāpatya viz recital of Gāyatri ten thousand times, standing in water, gift of a cow to a brāhmana&ndash;these four (including Prājāpatya) are equal, as also a thousand homas with sesame, recitation of the whole sammulā of the veda, feeding twelve brahmanas, Pavakesti are equal. The Caturyimsatimata 294 stated that one should substitute the gift of one cow for Prājāpatya penance, of two cows for Santa pana, of three cows for Parāka, Tapta-krcohra and Ati krccbra and eight for Cāndrāyana The result was that from medieval times at least even in the case of mahāpātakas there was a sliding scale of penancos ultimately ending in feeding brābmapas or making monetary or other presents to them, Tor example, the Mit (on Yaj. III. 326) says that in the case 295 of the twelve years&rsquo; penance, optionally 360 praja patyas could be performed, each prājāpatya extending over twelve days, that if a man was unable to undergo this he&rsquo; should donate as many (ie 360) nilch cows, if that was impossible he may donate their price or 360 niskas or even half or quarter thereof &amp;c. Yaj. III 309 provides (a lakh of) homas with sesame to the accompaniment of the Gayatri or making brahmanas recite the Veda by the gift of sesame. Vas 28 18-19 (=Atri VI. 7-8) and Viṣṇu Dh S9010 state that by feeding seven or five brāhmadas on the Full moon of Vaiśākha with sesame and honey a man becomes free of all sins. These prOVI</p>

<p>INI - Method of pratyānnõya</p>
<p>129</p>
<p>sions are maintained in almost all medieval works such as the Smrtyarthasāra pp. 149, 155, Prayascittasāra p. 203, Pr. T. pp. 517, 541, Pr. Mayūkha p. 18 &amp;c The same method is folloved in penances for lesser periods, It is due to this provi sion in the smrtis that in modern times men, when on death-bed, perform prāyaścittas for all their sins by donating a cow or mora or by monetary presents to priests.295&amp;</p>
<p>Some interesting sidelights ara thrown on the prices of milch cows, cows and bulls by the medieval writers The Pr, V. (p 199 ) states that the price of a milch cow (payasvini ) was 3 purānas, that of an ordinary cosy (go) one purāpa and that of a bull was five purāpas The Pr. T. (pp. 517–18 ) quotes Kātyāyana to the effect that the price of a cow (go) is 32 panas and that of a male calf one purana, that a pana is copper weighing 80 raklukūs or equal to 80 varūtakas ( cowr ies), that 16 panas were equal to one purana (following Bhaviṣya and Matsya purāpas ), that by niska is not meant the one indicated by Manu (VIII, 137 ) but a dīnāraniska i, e gold weighing 32 raktıkās. The Prayascittendusekliara p. 7 follows Yāj I 365 and holds that niska is silver equal (in weight) to four sular nas or a pala, A. raktika weighs on an average 1.8 grains; so : copper papa of 80 raktikās vould veigh about 144 grains, Therefore a dhenu vas equal to 32 panas (or two purānas) i, e. about 26 tolus of copper (one tola being taken as equal to 180 grains). Vide H of Dh, vol. III pp.120-121 notes 161 and 162 . for information about ancient coins and their weights. There appears to be owing to lapse of centuries some difference in the views of several writers According to Vijñāneśvara four surarnas are equal to a silver niska According to the Lilāvati 20 yarātakas are equal to a kākini, 4 kākinis are equal to a pada and a niska is equal to 256 papas,</p>
<p>295a There was a parallel to this method of pratyāmnāja in Europe as rewashed by Gibbon A year of penance was appreciated at 26 solidt of silver, about four pounds sterliog, for the rich, at 3 solıdı or nine shilliags for the jodigeat; and these alms were soon appropriated to the Church which derived from the redemption of sias an inexhaustible source of opulence and dominion&rsquo; Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, vol VII. p. 187 (Smulk&rsquo;s ed, of 1862).</p>
