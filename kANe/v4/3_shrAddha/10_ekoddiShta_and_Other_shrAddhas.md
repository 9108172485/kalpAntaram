CHAPTER X

EKODDIṢṬA AND OTHER ŚRĀDDHAS

Having dealt at great length with Pārvaṇaśrāddha which is the model of all śrāddhas it is now time to speak of Ekoddiṣṭa śrāddha that is a modification of Pārvaṇaśrāddha[^1150]. The word Ekoddiṣṭa means 'that in which only one deceased person[^1151] is intended (to be invoked or benefited)'. The Pārvaṇaśrāddha is intended for three paternal ancestors and is thus distinguished from Ekoddiṣṭa. In šān. gr. IV. 2, Baud. gr. III, 12.6, the Śrāddhasūtra of Katyāyana (kaṇḍikā 4), and Yāj. I. 251-252, the points of difference between the two are clearly set out[^1152]. In this śrāddha only one _arghya_ is offered, there is only one _pavitra_ and only one piṇḍa is offered, there is no _āvāhana_ (as there is in Pārvaṇa), no agnaukaraṇa, there are no brāhmaṇas invited to represent the Viśve-devas; the question about being satiated by the dinner is to be asked in the word 'svaditam' (did it taste well) and the brāhmaṇas reply with 'susvaditam') (it had excellent taste ); instead of saying 'may it be in exhaustible,' the formula here used is ‘May it approach' (or wait upon the deceased person); when the brāhmaṇas are sent away at the end of the dinner the word used is 'be satisfied (or delighted)' and they reply 'we are delighted.' The Vişṇupurāņa (1II. 13. 23-26) and Mārkaṇḍeya (28. 8-11) closely follow the Śrāddhasūtra and Yāj. According to śān. gr. (IV. 2. 7)[^1153], Manu III, 257, Mārkaṇḍeya (28. 11), Yāj. I. 256 and others, for one year after the death of a twice-born person till the sapiņḍikaraṇa śrāddha is performed this is the way in which śrāddha is to be performed for the _preta_ every month.

[^1150]:  अथेत्यनेनैकोद्दिष्टस्य पार्वणानन्तर्याभिधानं तयोः प्रकृतिविकृतित्वं सूचयति । श्राद्धतत्त्व p. 244.

[^1151]: एक उद्दिष्टो यस्मिन् श्राद्धे तदेकोद्दिष्टमिति कर्मनामधेयम् । मिता. on या. I. 251; elsewhere it says 'तत्र त्रिपुरुषोद्देशेन यत् क्रियते तत्पार्वणम्, एकपुरुषोद्देशेन क्रियमाणमेकोद्दिष्टम्'। मिता. on या. I. 217. हलायुध (folio 32b) on श्राद्धसूत्र says 'एकोत्र संप्रदानत्वेनोद्दिष्ट इति'।.

[^1152]: अथैकोद्दिष्टेषु नाग्नौकरणं नाभिश्रावणं न पूर्वे निमन्त्रणं न देवं न धूपं न दीपं न स्वधा न नमस्कारो नात्रापूपम् । बौ. गृ. सू. III. 12. 6.

[^1153]: अथैकोद्दिष्टम् । एकोऽर्घ एकं पवित्रमेकः पिण्डो नावाहनं नाग्नौकरणं नाब विश्वे देवाः स्वदितमिति तृप्तिप्रश्नः सुस्वदितमितीतरे ब्रूयुरुपतिष्ठतामित्यक्षय्यस्थानेऽभिरम्यतामिति विसर्गोऽभिरताः स्म इतीतरे । श्राद्धसूत्र 4 (कात्यायनीय). Almost the same words occur in कौषीतकिगृह्य 4. 2 (Benares S. Series). The यजुर्वेदिश्राद्धतत्त्व (Jiv.II p. 495) explains 'एकं एकदलरूपं पवित्रम्'।.

## Characteristics of Ekoddiṣṭa

The Viṣṇudharmasūtra 21.2 provides that suitable changes (üha) should be made in the mantras employed (e.g. instead of 'atra pitaro mādayadhvam' the mantra should be ‘atra pitarmādayasva' (O father![^1154] regale thyself here). In Ekoddiṣṭa such a formula as 'ye ca tvām-anu' (those that come after thee) cannot be employed and the word 'pitṛ' is not to be employed (till sapiṇḍikaraṇa is performed), but the word 'preta' (Aparārka p. 525 quoting Śaunaka-gṛhyapariśiṣṭa)[^1155].

As seen above (p. 262, note 591a) Ekoddiṣṭa śrāddhas are of three kinds, nava, navamiśra and purāņa. Navašrāddhas are those that are performed till the 10th or 11th day after death, navamiśras (or miśras) are those that are performed after the 11th day till one year (or six months, according to some) after death. Aparārka quotes a verse from Vyāghra[^1156] that Ekoddiṣṭa-śrāddha is performed on the 11th day, on the 4th day, at the end of each month for a year after death and every year on the day of death and a verse of Katyāyana that (ekoddiṣṭa) śrāddha should be performed for one who had kept sacred fires on the 11th day after the day of cremation and that the Dhruva śrāddhas should always be performed on the day of death. Aparärka explains 'Dhruvāṇi' as meaning those that are performed after three fortnights from death. About the navaśrāddha there is again a divergence of views. One meaning has already been given above on p. 262 note 593. The Skandapurāņa VI (Nāgarakhaṇḍa ) 205. 1-4 and Garudapurāņa (pretakhaṇḍa 5. 67-69 ) state that navašrāddhas are nine viz. the three performed where a man died, where the funeral procession rested on the way and where the burnt bones were collected and six more performed on the 5th, 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, and 11th days after death.

[^1154]: एकवन्मन्त्रानूहेतैकोद्दिष्टे । विष्णुध. सू. 21. 2. On this the दीपकलिका explains “अत्र पितरो मादयध्वमिति बहुवचनान्तेषु अत्र पितर्मादयस्व इति एकवचनेनोहः कार्यः".

[^1155]: ये च त्वामनु इत्यादि मन्त्रो न युज्यते। पितृशब्दं न कुर्वीत नमो वः पितर इत्यादि मन्त्रं न पठेत् । कल्पतरु (श्रा.) p. 246.

[^1156]: तत्र व्याघ्रः। एकादशे चतुर्थे च मासि मासि च वत्सरम् । प्रतिसंवत्सरं चैव मेकोद्दिष्टं मृताहनि॥ कात्यायनः । श्राद्धमग्निमतः कार्ये दाहादेकादशेऽहनि । ध्रुवाणि तु प्रकुर्वीत प्रप्नीताहनि सर्वदा ॥ अपरार्क p. 521. This last is गोभिलस्मृति III. 66 which reads प्रत्याब्दिकं प्रकुर्वीत.

Numerous works lay down that there are sixteen śrāddhas which must be performed for a deceased person and that if these are not performed then his spirit is not freed from the condition of being a _preta_ and a _piśaca_[^1157]. There is a great deal of divergence of views about what these sixteen śrāddhas are, some works including sapiṇḍikaraṇa among the 16, others excluding it therefrom. Gobhilasmṛti III. 67 enumerates[^1158] the 16 as follows: The twelve monthly śrāddhas (performed every month on the _tithi_ of death), the first (i.e. the sraddha on the 11th day), two śrāddhas on (a day prior to the expiry of) every six months from the tithi of death and sapiṇḍikaraṇà are the sixteen Śraddhas. The Garudapurāṇa[^1159] refers to three groups of sixteen, one of which enumerates the 16 sraddhas as those performed on the 12th day (after death), after three fortnights, after six months, after every month and at the end of the year, while the Padmapurāņa[^1160] enumerates them as follows: the sixteen śrāddhas are those performed on the 4th day after death, at the end of three fortnights, after six months, after a year and twelve śrāddhas performed each month (on the _tithi_ of death). The Kalpataru p. 25 and Brahmapurāṇa q. by Aparārka (p. 523) state that the 16 śrāddhas are those performed on 4th, 5th, 9th and 11th days after death and the twelve monthly śrāddhas (on the tithi of death[^1161]).

[^1157]: यस्यैतानि न दीयन्ते प्रेतश्राद्धानि षोडश । पिशाचत्वं ध्रुवं तस्य दत्तैः श्राद्ध शतैरपि॥ यम q. by श्रा. क्रि. को. p. 362. The same verse occurs in गरुडपुराण (प्रेतखण्ड 5. 50-51), लिखितस्मृति 16 (reads यस्यैतानि न कुर्वात एकोद्दिष्टानि), लघुशङ्क 13 (with variations), पद्म (सृष्टिखण्ड 47.272 reads न सन्तीह यथाशक्त्या च श्रद्धया). The verse is quoted by the मिता. on या 1.254 (reading न दत्तानि and प्रेतत्वं सुस्थिरं तस्य). प्रेतलोके तु वसतिर्नृणां वर्षे प्रकीतता। क्षुत्तृष्णे प्रत्यहं तत्र भवेतां भृगुनन्दन ॥ मार्कण्डेय q. by मिता. on या.

[^1158]: द्वादश प्रतिमास्यानि आद्यषाण्मासिके तथा । सपिण्डीकरणं चैव एतद्वै श्राद्धषोडशम्॥ गोभिलस्मृति III. 67. The word आद्य has been explained by या. I. 256 as मृतेहनि प्रकर्तव्यं प्रतिमासं तु वत्सरम्। प्रतिसंवत्सरं चैवमाद्यमेकादशेऽहनि ॥ on which the मिताः says 'आद्यं सर्वेकोद्दिष्टप्रकृतिभूतमेकोद्दिष्टमेकादशेहनि'. गरुड (प्रेत० 5.51) says: एकादशे द्वादशे वा दिने आद्यं प्रकीर्तितम्।. But अपरार्क p. 543 explains आद्य differently 'आद्यशब्देन नवश्राद्धान्युच्यन्ते. षाण्मासिके is explained by गोभिलस्मृति III. 68 as एकाहेन तु षण्मासा यदा स्युरपि वा त्रिभिः । न्यूनोः संवत्सराच्चैव स्यातां षाण्मासिके तथा ॥ q. by अपरार्क p. 522, श्रा. क्रि. कौ. p. 338 and explained as 'एकेनाह्ना त्रिभिर्वा अहोभिर्यदा षण्मासा न्यूनाः स्युः संवत्सरश्च तावत्संख्यया न्यूनास्ति तदा षाण्मासिके श्राद्धे कार्ये इत्यर्थः.

[^1159]: द्वादशाहे त्रिपक्षे च षण्मासे मासिकेऽब्दिके। तृतीयां षोडशीमेतां वदन्ति मतभेदत ॥ गरुड (प्रेतखण्ड 5.49-50); the other two groups are at chap. 35. 33-36 and in 37.

[^1160]: चतुर्थाहे त्रिपक्षे च षण्मासे चाब्दिके तथा। द्वादश प्रतिमास्यानि श्राद्धान्ये तानि षोडश। पद्म, सृष्टिखण्ड 5.271.

## Views on sixteen śrāddhas

Laugākşi and others say that after performing the 16 śrāddhas according to the procedure for Ekoddiṣṭa śrāddhas sapiṇḍana should be performed[^1162]. The Madanapārijāta (p. 615 ), the Nirṇayasindhu (III. p. 599) and others say that in this conflict of views one should follow the usage of one's country, Vedic śākhā or family. There were two views about the śrāddha on the 11th day. It should be remembered that Yāj. III. 22 laid down impurity on death for 10, 12, 15 and 30 days respectively for the four varņas. One view espoused by śankha and Paithinasi was that in spite of the days of impurity not being over śrāddha must be performed on the 11th day (and for the moment the performer becomes pure for that purpose). The other view was that of the Matsyapurāṇa and Vişṇudharmasūtra 21.1 that the first śrāddha (ekoddiṣṭa ) was to be performed on the expiry of āśauca.

In the case of ascetics dying it is provided by Uśanas[^1163] that by the fact of their taking to the order of _sannyāsa_ (of the ekadaṇḍi kind in the Kaliyuga ) they have not to undergo the condition of being _preta_, no Ekoddiṣṭa nor Sapiṇḍikaraṇa should be performed for them by their son or other relative but only pārvaṇaśräddha on the 11th day and every year thereafter. Sātātapa provides[^1164] that no Ekoddiṣṭa, no water, no piṇḍa and no cremation rites should be offered to an ascetic nor mourning should be observed, but pārvaṇa-śräddha should be performed. Pracetas quoted by Mit on Yāj. I. 256 states that no ekoddiṣṭa is to be performed for an ascetic nor sapiṇḍikaraṇa, but only pārvaṇa on the day of death every year in Bhadrapada dark half. The Sivapurāṇa (Kailāsa-samhitā) chapters 22 and 23 deal with the rites to be performed on an ascetic's death on the 11th and 12th days.

[^1162]: श्राद्धानि षोडशापाद्य विदधीत सपिण्डनम्। लौगाक्षि q. by मिता. on या. I, 255, निर्णयसिन्धु p. 599, भट्टोजि on चतुर्विशतिमतसंग्रह p. 168; ascribed to वायुपुराण by अपरार्क p. 532; सपिण्डीकरणादर्वाक् कुर्याछ्राद्धानि षोडश। एकोद्दिष्टविधानेन कुर्यात्सर्वाणि तानि तु ॥ q. by अपरार्क p. 522.

[^1163]: एकोद्दिष्टं न कुर्वीत यतीनां चैव सर्वदा। अहन्यकादशे प्राप्ते पार्वणं तु विधीयते ॥ सपिण्डीकरणं तेषां न कर्तव्यं सुतादिभिः । त्रिदण्डग्रहणादेव प्रेतत्वं नैव जायते ॥ उशनमस् by मिता. on या. I. 255, परा. मा. I. 2. p. 458, श्रा. क्रि. कौ. pp. 444-445.

[^1164]: एकोद्दिष्टं जलं पिण्डमाशौचं प्रेतसत्क्रियाम् । न कुर्याद्वार्षिकादन्यद् ब्रह्मभूता हि ते स्मृताः॥ शातातप q. by मद. पा. p. 627, श्रा क्रि. कौ. p. 445, अपरार्क p. 538(reads पार्वणादन्यद् ब्रह्मीभूताय भिक्षवे).

In the Navaśrāddhas no incense, no lamps are employed. All mantras having the words 'pitṛ' and 'svadhā namaḥ' are omitted and so is the word 'anu' omitted and there is no _japa_ and no recital of mantras in the hearing of the brāhmaṇas. As stated in the Brahmapurāņa, the śrāddhas performed in the house at the end of impurity on the 12th day, at the end of a month etc, are called ekoddiṣṭa. It follows that the rites called navaśrāddhas offered during the days of impurity are performed at the place of death or in the cemetery or at a place where water and piņda are offered (and not in the house ); vide Sm. C. (āśauca p. 176 ). In the _navamiśra_ śrāddha mantras are employed according to some. In former times and now also all the 16 śrāddhas are performed on the 11th day. Hardly any one waits for one year to perform Sapiṇḍikaraṇa. In former times it was laid down (e.g. by the Mit. ) that in times of difficulty, Sapiṇḍikaraṇa should be performed even before a year elapses after performing the sixteen śrāddhas. But now this exception has become the rule.

Sapiṇḍikaraṇa or Sapiṇḍana is the reception of a deceased person into the community of pitṛs to whom piṇḍas are offered. Several times were prescribed by ancient works for this. Acc. to the Kauṣītaki gr. IV. 2 this śrāddha could be performed after the death of the deceased at the end of a year or at the end of three fortnights or on the happening of a lucky event (like the birth of a son or a marriage). The Bhāradvāja[^1165] gr. (III. 17) allowed it at the end of a year (after death) or in the 11th or 6th or 4th month or on the 12th day. The Baud. Pitṛmedhasūtra II. 12.1 mentions five times for sapiṇḍikaraṇa viz, one year, 11th, 6th or 4th month or 12th day. The Garudapurāņa (Pretakhaṇḍa 6. 53-54) states the time of Sapiṇḍikaraṇa to be one year, six months, three fortnights, the 12th day or on a lucky occasion. The Vişṇupurāņa (III. 13. 26ff) makes similar provisions about sapiṇḍikaraṇa (which is an ekoddiṣṭa śrāddha). Aparārka (p. 540) after a long discussion holds that there are three times for a performer who is an _āhitāgni_ viz. 12th day, some day between the end of _āśauca_ and the first amāvāsya (after death) or the first amāvāsyā after āśauca ends and prescribes four times for one who has not kept sacred fires, viz. a year, six months, three fortnights or when a lucky event occurs.

[^1165]: संवत्सरे सपिण्डीकरणमेकादशे मासि षष्ठे चतुर्थे द्वादशेहनि। भारद्वाजगृह्य III 17.1; आनन्त्यात्कुलधर्माणां पुंसां चैवायुषः क्षयात् । अस्थिरत्वाच्छरीरस्य द्वादशाहो प्रशस्यते ॥ व्यास q. by मद. पा. p. 631, श्रा.क्रि. को. p. 350 (ascribes to व्याघ्र ), पृथ्वीच. fohan 237 a (ascribes to व्याघ्र), भट्टोजि p. 176 of चतुर्विशति०, श्राद्धतत्त्व p. 301.

## The time for Sapiṇḍikaraṇa

The Madanapārijāta quotes a verse of Vyāsa that the 12th day is commended (for the sapiṇḍana śrāddha) because family usages are innumerable, because man's life is short and because the body is evanescent. The Vişņu Dh. S. (21.20) provides that for śūdras 12th day after death is the only day for Sapiṇḍikaraṇa (but without Vedic mantras). Gobhila laid down that after Sapiṇḍikaraṇa was performed, there was to be no performance of śrāddhas every month, but Gautama (or Śaunaka, according to Aparārka p. 543) held the view that they may be performed according to the procedure of ekoddiṣṭa śrāddhas. Bhattoji says [^1166] that when sapiṇḍikaraṇa is performed before the end of the year, then all the sixteen śrāddhas must be performed before Sapiṇḍikaraṇa, yet the monthly śrāddhas should again be performed at their proper times for one year. Yāj. I. 255 and Vişnu Dh. S. 21. 23 prescribe that even if Sapiṇḍikaraṇa is performed for a deceased person within less than a year from death still for one year food and a jar of water should be given to a brāhmaṇa for the whole year (for the benefit of the deceased). Uśanas provides that even if the heirs of a deceased person are divided in wealth, still the _navaśrāddhas_, the sixteen śrāddhas, and sapiṇḍikaraṇa must be performed by one alone[^1167] (e.g. the eldest son), but Pracetas provides that when a year has ( elapsed ) śrāddha may be performed separately by each heir[^1168].

The procedure of Sapiṇḍana or Sapiṇḍikaraṇa is described in numerous works such as the Sān. gr. V. 9, Kauṣitaki gr. IV. 2, Baud. Pitṛmedhasūtra III, 12.12, Śrāddha-sūtra of Kātyāyana (kaṇḍikā 5), Yāj. I. 253-254, Vişņupurāņa III. 13.27 ff., Viṣṇu Dh. S. 21. 12-23, Padma (Sṛṣṭikhanda 10.22-33), Mārkaṇḍeya-purāņa 28. 12-18, Garuda-purāņa I. 220, Viṣņudharmottara II, 77, Smṛtyarthasāra pp. 57-58, Nirṇayasindhu (IIL, p. 614). It is briefly set out here[^1169].

[^1166]: यदा संवत्सरपूर्तेः प्रागेव सपिण्डीकरणं क्रियते तदा यद्यपि षोडश श्राद्धानि ततः प्रागेव कृतानि-श्राद्धानि षोडशादत्त्वा न कुर्यात्तु सपिण्डनम् इति वृद्धवसिष्ठोक्तेः, तथापि स्वस्वकाले पुनरपि मासिकादीन्यावर्तनीयानि। भट्ठोजि on चतुर्विंशतिमतसंग्रह p. 171.

[^1167]: नवश्राद्धं सपिण्डत्वं श्राद्धान्यपि च षोडश। एकेनैव हि कार्याणि संविभक्तधनेष्वपि॥ उशनस् q. by अपरार्क p. 524, मिता. on या. I. 255 (without name). This verse is गरुडपुराण, प्रेत 34. 128-129.

[^1168]: अर्वाक् संवत्सरात्सर्वे कुर्युः श्राद्धं समेत्य वै। संवत्सरे व्यतीते तु कुर्युः श्राद्धं पृथक् पृथक्॥ प्रचेतस् q. by अपरार्क p. 524.

[^1169]: The सङ्कल्प in सपिण्डन will be somewhat as follows: 'अमुकगोत्रस्यामुकशर्मणः प्रेतस्य प्रेतत्वनिवृत्त्या पितृलोकप्राप्त्यर्थममुकगोत्रैः अमुकशर्मभिर्वसुरुद्रादित्यस्वरूपैः प्रेतपितृपितामहप्रपितामहैः सह सपिण्डीकरणं मृताहाद् द्वादशेऽह्नि पार्वणैकोधिष्टविधिना करिष्ये'।

As said by Baud.Pitṛmedhasūtra III, 12.12, in this śrāddha there is invitation to the brāhmaṇas the previous day, there is agnaukaraṇa, there is the recital of Vedic texts when the brāhmaṇas are engaged in eating, Vaišvadeva brāhmaṇas are honoured, the Viśvedevas are Kāma and Kāla (vide n. 1018), there is the presentation of incense and lamp, there is _svadhā_ and also _namaskāra_. Four vessels for _arghya_ should be got ready and filled with sandalwood paste, water and sesamum grains, one being for the deceased (the _preta_) and three for his paternal ancestors; two daiva brāhmaṇas should be invited, one to represent the _preta_ and three to represent the three paternal ancestors of the _preta_; if a man is unable to invite so many brāhmaṇas, he should invite three, one for Viśvedevas, one for the preta and one for the three paternal ancestors. He should request 'I shall unite the vessel for the preta with the vessels for his three paternal ancestors.' When permitted in the words 'do unite', he should cast the kuśas in the vessel for the _preta_ into the vessels for his three paternal ancestors, should keep a little water mixed with kuśas in the vessel for the _preta_ and distribute the rest of the water from the preta vessel into the three vessels for his ancestors with the two mantras[^1169] 'ye samānā' (Vāj. S. 19. 45-46). Arghya is offered to the brāhmaṇa representing the preta with the water that remains in the preta vessel, arghya is offered to the three _pitṛya_ brāhmaṇas from the three pitṛya vessels. Four piṇḍas should be prepared, one for the _preta_ and three for his ancestors and then the performer requests "I shall unite the pretapiṇḍa with the piṇḍas for the three ancestors of his'; when permitted in the words 'do unite', the performer divides the pretapiṇḍa into three parts and puts each third into each of the three piṇḍas with the same two mantras (Vāj. S. 19. 45-46). The Garudapurāṇa (I. 220,6 ) strikes a discordant note in that it states that the pretapiṇḍa is to be divided in two parts, each of which is to be placed inside the piṇḍas for pitämaha and prapitāmaha only.

[^1169a]: The two mantras are: ये समानाः समनसः पितरो यमराज्ये । तेषां लोकः स्वधा नमो यज्ञो देवेषु कल्पताम्॥ ये समानाः समनसो जीवा जीवेषु मामकाः। तेषां श्रीर्मयि कल्पतामस्मिँल्लोके शतं समाः॥ वाज. सं. 19.45-46, काठकसंहिता 38. 23-24. भारद्वाजगृह्य III. 17 sets out the following formula for तिलप्रदान 'ये समाना ये सजाता इति द्वाभ्यामसौ पितृभिः पितामहेभिः प्रपितामहेभिः सहैतत्ते तिलोदकं तस्मै ते स्वधा नाम इति तिलोदकप्रदानम् ।'. In place of असौ one has to use the vocative 'अस्मत्पितरमुकगोत्रा मुकशर्मन् प्रेत'. पितामहेभिः and प्रपितामहेभिः are Vedic Instrumentals (plural).

##Sapiņḍikaraṇa

Sapiṇḍikaraṇa partakes of the character of both ekoddiṣṭa and pārvaṇa, the first applying to the _preta_ and the 2nd to the three ancestors of the _preta_, so that in it two kinds of śrāddhas are combined. When the sapiṇḍikaraṇa rite is completed by the giving of dakşiņā to the brāhmaṇas, then the _preta_ ceases to be so and himself becomes a pitṛ. The status of being a _preta_ involves the experiencing of great torments due to hunger and thirst and becoming a pitṛ means being brought in contact with the śrāddha devatās called Vasu, Rudra and Āditya[^1170]. The word _preta_ has two meanings, (1) a person who is dead and (2) one who being dead has not the sapiṇḍikaraṇa performed for him. The result of sapiṇḍana is that the[^1171] great-grandfather of the deceased whose sapiṇḍana is performed drops out from the list of pitṛs entitled to piņḍa and becomes one called 'lepabhāk' (entitled to only wipings of the hand) and the former "_preta_ becomes one of the pitṛs and entitled to participate in the piṇḍas offered at a pārvaṇaśräddha thereafter. As stated in the Garudapurāna I. 220. 2 the sapiṇḍikaraṇa-śrāddha is to be performed like the pārvaṇa in the afternoon.

It may be noted that in some works the mantras recited at the time of pouring the water from the preta vessel into the pitṛ vessels are different. For example, the Viṣṇu Dh.S. 21. 14 says[^1172] the mantras are 'Samsṛjatu tvä pṛthivi' (May the earth unite thee) and 'samāni va ākutiḥ' (Ṛg. X. 191.4), while the Gṛhya-pariśiṣṭa[^1173] of Āśv. employs the three Madhumati verses (Ṛg. I. 90.6-8) and the three fine verses at the end of the Ṛgveda beginning with 'saṅgacchadhvam! (Ṛg.

'sāmanā va ākūtāni' and 'sam vo manāṁsi' (काठकसंहिता 10.38-39) are recited.

Yāj. (I. 254) and Mārkaṇḍeya (28. 17-18) provide that Ekoddiṣṭa and Sapiṇḍikaraṇa śrāddhas are performed for women also (but not pārvaṇa nor ābhyudayika). About the Sapiṇḍikaraṇa of the mother there are somewhat conflicting dicta. If a woman dies sonless and her husband is alive, her sapiṇḍana is effected with her mother-in-law (Gobhilasmr̥ti II. 102). If a woman dies leaving no son and the husband also is dead, then no sapiṇḍana can be performed for her. If she died either on the funeral pyre of her husband[^1174] or afterwards (as a _Sati_) then her son should perform her sapiṇḍana with her husband (i.e, the son's father) and there is no separate sapiṇḍana for her. If she was married in the _āsura_ form or she was made a _putrikā_, then the son should perform his mother's sapiṇḍana with his maternal grandfather; while a son born of a woman married in the _Brāhma_ and three other proper forms may perform her sapiṇḍana with her husband or the paternal grandmother or the maternal grandfather. In the case of these three alternatives if there is a certain family usage that should be followed; otherwise there is an option. If a woman has a step-son, the latter should perform her sapiṇḍana with his father, as Manu IX. 183 ( = Vas. 17. 11) indicates. Vide the Mit. on Yāj. I. 253-254 and Sm. C. (on āśauca p. 169) for discussion of these points and for various alternatives[^1175].

[^1174]: सपिण्डीकरणं तासां पुत्राभावे न विद्यते । प्रतिसंवत्सरं कार्यमेकोद्दिष्टं नरैः स्त्रियाः॥ मार्कण्डेय 28.18 on which रुद्रधर (श्राद्धविवेक p. 113) says : अत्र पुत्राभाव इत्युपलक्षणं पतिपुत्राभाव इति द्रष्टव्यम् ।.

Therefore the मिता. says 'मातुः सपिण्डी करणेपि विरुद्धानि वाक्यानि दृश्यन्ते'।.

The Nirṇayasindhu (III. p. 388) says that there is no sapiṇḍana for one whose upanayana was not performed when
he died, but if he was more than five years old then the 16 śrāddhas are performed for him (though not sapiṇḍana) and piṇḍa is offered on bare ground. It may be noted that no auspicious rite like marriage in which ābhyudayika śräddha is necessary can be performed until the sapiṇḍana of a deceased person of the family has been effected (except in the case of such absolutely necessary ceremonies as simantonnayana).

Manu (V. 89-90) prescribes that no water and other rites like sapiṇḍikaraṇa are offered and performed for those who had left off their faith, who were born of condemned mixed marriages, who entered ascetic orders, who had committed suicide (by hanging, poison &c.), who had embraced heretical doctrines, for women that wilfully seek illicit connection with men, that did harm to their foetus or husband (were guilty of abortion and murder of husband) and that were addicted to drinking _surā_. Yāj. III, 6 contains similar provisions. It has to be noted that every kind of suicide is not condemned by the ancient smr̥tis. Vide H. of Dh. vol. III, pp. 939, 958–9 for cases where suicide was not condemned. Except in those cases Yama (q. by the Mit. on Yāj. III. 6) provides that in the case of the persons mentioned in Manu and Yāj. there is to be no āśauca observed, no water oftered, no tears shed, no cremation and no last rites. The Mit. (on Yāj. III, 6) quotes Vr̥ddha Yājñavalkya and Chāgaleya that in the case of those who are guilty of condemned suicide the procedure of Nārāyaņabali should be resorted to after a year and _then śrāddha_ may be offered to them. Then the Mit. describes at length the procedure of Nārāyaṇabali. Vide note 838 b p. 370 above for the Skandapurāņa, Nāgarakhanda 219. 19-21 on the view that śrāddha may be performed on the 14th of the dark half for persons who committed suicide or who met a violent death.

## Ābhyudayika-śrāddha

The _Ābhyudayika-śrāddha_ is to be now described. Āśv. gr. IV.7 mentions in one place only four śrāddhas viz. Pārvaṇa, Kāmya, Ābhyudayika and Ekoddiṣṭa (note 966 above). Many of the sūtras such as Āśv. gr. II. 5. 13-15, Sān. gr. IV. 4, Gobhila gr. IV. 3. 35-37, Kauşitaki gr. IV. 4, Baud. gr. III. 12. 2-5, the Śrāddhasūtra of Kātyāyana (kaṇḍikā 6 ) briefly describe this śrāddha. According to most of these sutras this sraddha is performed when there is a lucky event such as the birth of a son, or his _caula_, _upanayana_ or marriage or there 18the commencement of a charitable (_pūrta_) act (such as the dedication of a well or a tank or a park to the public). Āśv.gr. and Gobhila gr. are very brief. They say that in this śräddha performed on auspicious occasions or on the under taking of meritorious acts an even number of brāhmapas is to be fed, that the rite is to be performed from left to right and that yavas (barley ) are to be used instead of sesamum grains. As this śrāddha is only a modification (viksti) of pārvaṇa ( as said by Aparārka p. 514) all rules of the latter will be applicable to the former except where special directions are given. The Āśv. gr. pariśiṣṭa II. 19, Smộtyarthasāra (p. 56), Pitrdayitā pp. 62-71 give a compact but tolerably full description of this śrāddha.

In this śrāddha which is to be performed in the morning (except on the birth of a son when it is to be done at once ) the Višve-devas are called Satya and Vasu, it is performed in the forenoon, the brāhmaṇas to be invited must be even in number, the darbhas are to be straight (and not doublefolded) and are not to be with their roots; the performer wears his sacred thread in the usual form ( and not in the _prācināvita_ form), all actions are to be done from left to right (pradakşiņam and not prasavyam); the word svadhā is not to be used; yava grains are to be employed instead of sesamum grains; he invites them with the words 'find time to attend Nāndīšrāddha'. The brāhmaṇas say 'be it so'. He says 'May you two come ( to my house )'; they reply 'we two shall come'. The performer faces the east or north (but never the south); the mantra about yavas is 'yavosi' (vide note 966 )[^1176] he requests 'I shall invoke the pitṛs called Nāndimukha'.[^1177] When permitted by the brāhmaṇas in the words 'do invoke' he says 'may the Nāndimukha pitṛs be pleased'; he offers arghya only once with the words 'O Nāndīmukha pitṛs! this is the arghya for you'. Sandalwood paste, incense, lamp are to be given twice; the _homa_ is made on the hand of the brāhmaṇa. the two mantras being 'to Agni, the bearer of _kavya!_ svāhā' and 'to Soma accompanied by the pitṛs! svāhā.'

[^1176]: The मन्त्र here repeated is 'यवोसि...प्रत्तः पुष्टया (in place of स्वधया) नान्दीमुखान् पितॄन्...नः स्वाहा नमः (instead of स्वधा नमः)'.

[^1177]: The सङ्कल्प will be somewhat as follows: ओम्, अद्यामुकगोत्राणां मातृपितामहीप्रपितामहीनाममुकामुकामुकदेवीनां नान्दीमुखीनां तथामुकगोत्राणां पितृपितामहप्रपितामहानाममुकामुकामुकशर्मणां नान्दीमुखानां तथामुकगोत्राणां मातामहप्रमाता महवृद्धप्रमातामहानाममुकामुकामुकशर्मणां नान्दीमुखानाममुकगोत्रस्य कर्तव्यामुककर्मनिर्मित्तकमाभ्युदयिकश्राद्धमहं करिष्ये। श्राद्धविवेक of रुद्रधर p. 149. For देवीनां it is usual to put दानां.

While the brāhmaṇas are eating the dinner, the Rākṣoghna mantras and mantras addressed to Indra and propitiatory mantras may be recited but not the mantras addressed to pitřs (viz, Ṛg. X. 15. 1-13); when he sees that the brāhmaṇas are satiated, he recites the five verses (Ṛg. IX. 11.1-5) beginning with 'upāsmai gāyatā naraḥ' (O men! sing for this soma) instead of the Madhumati verses (viz, Ṛg. I. 90. 6-8) and at the end he makes the brāhmaṇas hear the mantra 'the pitṛs have partaken ( of the food ), they have regaled themselves'. The performer should ask 'I shall request the nāndimukha pitṛs to utter benedictions' at the stage where (in Pārvaṇa) 'akṣayyodaka' is asked for, to which the brāhmaṇas respond with the words 'do request.' The performer employs the word 'sampannam' (was it perfect) in asking about the gratification of the brāhmaṇas, who reply with the word 'susampannam' (it was quite perfect). On the brāhmaṇas sipping water after their dinner, he cowdungs the places where the dinner was taken, strews darbha grass thereon with their tips turned towards the east and offers thereon two piṇḍas for (each of the ancestors) made with the food that remains after the brāhmaṇas have eaten mixed with curds, jujube fruit and _pr̥ṣadājya_[^1178] (mixture of curds and clarified butter). The piṇḍas are offered to the mātr̥s, to the three paternal ancestors and the three maternal ancestors (viz. mother's father, mother's paternal grandfather and her paternal great-grandfather). Some do not offer piṇḍas in this śräddha (as stated by Aśv. gr. pariśiṣṭa II. 19). The Pitr̥dayitā and Śrāddha-tattva (Jiv. p. 297) say that no mātr̥śrāddha is to be performed in Ābhyudayikaśrāddha by the followers of the Sāmaveda. It is possible that the sraddha for the mother, paternal grandmother and paternal great-grandmother was inspired by the Anvaṣṭakya śrāddha, as the sūtras from Āśv. gr. quoted below will indicate[^1178a].

The words Nāndiśrāddha and Vr̥ddhiśrāddha are synonymous. When Yāj 1.250 says[^1179] that the Nāndimukha pitṛs should be worshipped with piṇḍas when there is _vr̥ddhi_ (a lucky or auspicious event), he indicates that Nāndīśrāddha and Vr̥ddhiśräddha mean the same thing.

[^1178]: पृषदाज्य is defined in आश्व. गृ. IV. 1. 17 as 'दधन्यत्र सर्पिरानयत्यत्त त्पित्र्यं पृषदाज्यम्'.

As noted by the Mit. on Yāj. I. 250 quoting Śātātapa this śrāddha is made of three parts, viz. mātṛ-śräddha, pitṛśrāddha and mātāmahaśrāddha[^1180]. On the other hand the Bhaviṣya-purāna I. 185. 15 states that there are two śrāddhas in this viz. Mātṛ-śrāddha and Nāndimukha-pitṛ-śrāddha. Ābhyudayika-śrāddha and Vṛddhiśrāddha are treated as synonyms in some works such as the Padmapurāṇa[^1181], though it may be said that Ābhyudayika śrāddha is wider in import than Vṛddhiśrāddha, since it is also applicable to śrāddha performed on the commencement of a _pūrta_ act.

The Viṣṇupurāņa III, 13. 2-7, Mārkaṇḍeya 28. 4-7, Padma purăņa (srsti 9. 194–199), Bhaviṣyapurāņa I. 185. 5-13, the Viṣṇudharmottara I, 142. 13-18 describe briefly the procedure of Nändiśrāddha and also the occasions on which it is to be performed. The occasions specified are[^1182]: on the marriages of sons and daughters, on entering a new house, on naming a child, at the time of Cūdākarma, at Simantonnayana, on the birth of a son, a householder should honour the group of pitṛs called Nāndimukha. The Mārkaṇḍeya-purāņa 28. 6 notes that some desire that this śrāddha should not have Vaišvadeva brāhmaṇas, but the Padmapurāņa (srṣṭikhaṇḍa 9.195) says that in this Vṛddhiśräddha the mothers are to be first honoured, then the fathers. then the mātāmahas and then the Viśve-devas. Hemādri (śr. p. 107) quotes two verses from the Brahmapurāņa to the effect that the father, paternal grandfather and paternal great-grand father are called _aśrumukha_ pitṛs, while the three paternal ancestors beyond the great-grandfather are called Nāndimukha pitṛs[^1183]. The Kalpataru (on śrāddha p. 270) explains these verses as meaning no more than this that in case the three paternal ancestors of a man are living and there is a lucky event, then the devatās for Nāndiśräddha in his case would be the three paternal ancestors beyond the great-grandfather.

The Bhaviṣyapurāņa notes that according to family usage some did not offer piņdas in Vṛddhiśrāddha[^1183a].

The word 'mätaraḥ' has two meanings. Gobhilasmr̥ti[^1184] prescribes that at the beginning of all rites the Mātṛs together with Gaṇeśa have to be worshipped and it names fourteen mātṛs such as Gauri, Padmā, Śaci (1, 11-12)[^1185]. In the Mārkaṇḍeya-purāna ( 88,11-20 and 38 ) they are said to be seven viz. Brahmäni and others. Vide H, of Dh. vol. II pp. 217-218 for the Matṛs and their worship[^1186]. Aparārka (p. 517) quotes verses to the effect that in Vṛddhiśrāddha one must offer worship to the seven mātṛs (Brahmāni and others ), then to one's mother, paternal grandmother, and paternal great grandmother, then to the Nāndimukha pitṛs and then to the mātāmahas together with their wives. The Śrāddhaprakāśa (of Viramitrodaya ) quotes Vṛddha-Vasiṣṭha to the effect that in the Mātṛśrāddha (as part of Vṛddhi-śrāddha) if a sufficient number of brāhmaṇas be not available then for the groups of mātṛs and of mātāmahis four women (for each group) whose husbands are living and who have a son or sons should be invited to dinner[^1186a] and honoured.

[^1186]: The worship of the mother Goddess or of mother Goddesses is one of the oldest and most widespread forms of religion. The mother Goddess appears in the civilizations of Mesopotamia and Syria, in prehistoric Europe and west Africa. Rude female figures, which represent idols of the mother' Goddesses, have been discovered in the earliest deposit of pre- historic cultures, . Vide Mother Goddesses' by Mr. S. K. Dikshitit Poona).

The _Pratisāmvatsarika_ or _Pratyābdika_ śrāddha has already been described above at great length. It is to be performed every year on the day of death (Gobhilasmr̥ti III. 66 ). It is laid down that in the case of one's parents this śrāddha partakes of the character of _pārvaṇa_[^1186b]. The Bhaviṣya-purāņa and Skanda state that the Sāṁvatsarika śrăddha is the most eminent among śrāddhas and that if a son does not perform the yearly śrāddha of his parents on the day of death he goes to the horrible Hell called Tämisra and then is born as a pig in a town[^1187]. In connection with this, if the _tithi_ or month of death or both are not known then Bṛhaspati, the Skandapurāņa, Padma and Bhaviṣyapuräna lay down certain rules, viz. [^1188] (1) if the _tithi_ is known but the month is not known, then the śrāddha should be performed on that tithi in the month of Mārgaśīrsa or Māgha; (2) if the month is known but the tithi is not known, then the śrāddha should be performed on the amāvāsyā of the month; (3) if both the tithi and the month are not known, then one should take the tithi and the month when the deceased started from home; (4) if even the day and month of starting be not known, then the tithi and month in which a person hears of the death of a relative should be taken. It is to be noted that the month in pitṛya rites is lunar and the words '_dina, ahaḥ, väsara_' in connection with pitṛya rites mean 'tithi' ( Aparārka p. 545). There is no _pratyābdika_ śrāddha in an intercalary month (Skanda VII. 1. 206.59 ).

A few words may now be said about some other śrāddhas.

[^1186b]: एतच्च मृताहपार्वणं मातापित्रोरेव । तथा च हेमाद्रिधृतकात्यायनवचनं 'सपिण्डीकरणादूर्ध्वे पित्रोरेव हि पार्वणम् । पितृव्यभ्रातृमातृणामेकोद्दिष्टं सदैव तु ॥ मातृपदं सपत्नीमातृपरम्'। श्राद्धतत्त्व p. 304.

Vide भविष्यपुराण I. 183, 28-29, स्कन्द VII. 1.205.52 for similar rules. बृहस्पति q. by अपरार्क p. 545 has similar verses and adds 'दिनमासौ न विज्ञातौ मरणस्य यदा पुनः। प्रस्थामदिनमासौ तु ग्राह्यौ पूर्वोक्तया दिशा'॥ .

## The Mahālayaśrāddha

A well-known śrāddha is the Mahālayaśrāddha. Some of the Purāṇas deal with this. The Padmapurāna (Srṣṭi-khaṇḍa) says 'In the fifth fortnight (_pakşa_) beginning from the Full Moon day of Āṣādha, one should perform a śrāddha, whether the Sun is by that time in the zodiacal sign of Kanyā (Virgo) or not. The sixteen days when the Sun is in Kanyā are equal to the solemn sacrifices which are completed with the gift of the best of dakşiņās. If it is not possible to perform the śrāddha in the dark half (when the Sun is in Kanyā), one may perform it when the Sun is in Tulā (Balance). When the Sun enters the sign of Scorpion (without a śrāddha being performed), the Fathers go away losing all hope and after pronouncing a terrible curse (on their descendants) they return to their abode'[^1189]. The fifth fortnight from the Full Moon day of Āsādha is the dark half of Bhādrapada. The dark half is the preserve of pitṛs. In Bhādrapada the Sun is in the middle of its apparent motion in dakşiņāyana. Therefore the dark half of Bhādrapada is specially chosen as the best period for śrāddha to the pitṛs i.e. for the Mahālaya. The śräddha performed in Bhādrapada dark half is called Mahālaya-śrāddha, since that fortnight is the abode (_ālaya_) as it were of the _maha_ (i.e. festival day ) for pitṛs. The real idea is that the dark half of Bhādrapada is specially to be welcomed for a śrāddha when the Sun is in Kanyā during that fortnight and that even if the Sun is not in _Kanyā_ the dark half of Bhādrapada is still a good time for a śrāddha to the pitṛs. The Skandapurāna[^1190] also says 'In the fifth fortnight from the Full Moon of Āṣādha, when the Sun occupies the sign of Kanyā, the pitṛs of him who offers a śräddha on the tithi of the death (of one's father) certainly derive gratification for one year thereafter.'

The first verse आषाढी-occurs in अग्निपुराण 175.33 and is ascribed to जातूकर्ण्य by श्रा. कि को. p. 283 and अपरार्क p. 423, which reads the third पाद as श्राद्धकालः स विज्ञेयः. The verse कन्यागते is ascribed to the ब्रह्मपुराण by श्रा.क्रि. को. p. 285 (which reads तुल्यानि देवो नारायणोऽब्रवीत्) and to ब्रह्माण्डपुराण by अपरार्क p. 424 (which reads last पाद as तत्र दत्तं महाफलम्) and to श्लोकगौतम by श्रा. क.ल. p.99. यान्यहानि तु षोडश-These words are explained in two ways : 'कदाचित् पक्ष विवृद्धौ षोडशदिनात्मकोऽपि नभस्यस्यापरः पक्षः श्राद्धकर्मणि कालो न तु पञ्चदशदिनात्मको वेति दर्शयितुमुक्तम् । यद्वा अमावास्याया अनन्तरभूतायाः प्रतिपत्तिथ्या अपि संग्रहणार्थ तिथि षोडशकः' इत्युक्तम् । प्रतिपदोपि क्षीणचन्द्रवे सापरपक्षतुल्यत्वात् । स्मृतिच. (श्रा. p. 365). There is also a third way viz., including the preceding full moon day along with the 15 days of the dark half. प्रजापतिस्मृति verse 161 is very similar to the verse कन्यागते and कल्पतरु (श्रा. p. 16) quotes it from ब्रह्माण्ड.

The Kalpataru quotes the Bhaviṣya purāņa to the effect that if a man has not performed śrāddha in Mahālaya (i. e. in the dark fortnight of Bhädrapada when the Sun is in the sign of Kanyā) he should offer it on the 15th day (of the dark half of Āśvina) on which, it is well-known, lamps are lighted.1191 The Śrāddha-sāra (p. 113) and the Smrtimuktā phala (on śrāddha p. 745) quote Vrddha-manu to the effect that the latter half of Bhadrapada when the Sun is in Kanyā is called Mahālaya and also Gajacchāyā. Various views are held on the question of the exact day on which the Mahālayaśrāddha is to be performed, viz. it may be performed on any day from the first tithi of the dark half of Bhādrapada to the amāvāsyā or from the fifth of the dark half to the amāväsyā of Bhādrapada or from the 8th or 10th of the dark half to amāvāsyā or from the 5th of the dark half of Bhadrapada to the 5th of the next fort night or on any day on which the Sun is in Kanyā or on any -day till the Sun enters Scorpion. 1192 Prajāpati states that there are numerous śrāddhas described by the Purāṇas, all of them yield rewards but the Mahālaya (śräddha) is the most eminent among them. 1193

The Mahālayaśräddha is to be performed, as stated by the Mārkaṇḍeyapurāņa, in accordance with the procedure of Pārva pašrāddha. 1194 The Smrtyarthasāra states that if it is not pos sible to perform all śrāddhas (except sapiṇḍikaraṇa) according to the detailed procedure of Pārvaṇaśrāddha they should be performed by the procedure called 'Sankalpavidhi', which con sists in performing the details laid down for Pārvaṇa as far as possible except the details of āvāhana, arghya, homa and piṇḍadāna. 1195 The Madanapārijāta (pp. 609-610) also states that when a man has to perform a sankalpa-śrāddha' he need not go through the details of arghyadāna, vikira and there is no āvāhana, no agnaukaraṇa and no piṇḍadāna even, but he has simply to feed a brāhmaṇa or brāhmaṇas.

Mahālayaśrāddha

533

In the Mahālayaśrāddha the Viśvedevas are Dhuri and Locana. This śrāddha is performed for the benefit not only of the paternal and maternal ancestors with their wives, but also for other relatives and persons that are dead (together with their wives, sons and husbands if these be dead) viz. one's step mother, one's wife, son, daughter, paternal uncle, maternal uncle, brother, paternal aunt and maternal aunt, sister, paternal uncle's son, son-in-law, sister's son, father-in-law, mother-in law, ācārya, upādhyāya, guru, friend, pupil and any other relative. 1196 Some perform only for the paternal ancestors with their wives and the maternal ancestors with their wives. The day on which the moon is in Bharani nakşatra in the dark half of Bhādrapada is called Mahābharani and śrāddha performed on that day is said to be equal to Gayāśrāddha (Matsyapurāņa q. by Śr. K. L. p. 99). The Mahālaya-śrāddha is to be performed on the 12th tithi of Bhadrapada dark half in the case of a sannyāsin and on no other tithi and his yearly śrāddha is to be performed by his son according to pārvaṇa method as in the case of householders. The dvādaśi is sacred to Viṣṇu and yatis always repeat the words 'namo Nārāyaṇāya' and therefore the 12th is the special tithi for the mahālaya śrāddha of yatis. The Mahālayaśrāddha is not to be performed in an intercalary month (malamāsa ).

Two more śrāddhas that are performed even to this day may be mentioned here. One is called 'Mātāmahasraddha' or "Dauhitra-pratipad-śrāddha'. A daughter's son whose parents are alive can alone perform a śrāddha for his maternal grand-father (together with the maternal grand-mother if she also be dead) on the first tithi of the bright half of Āśvina 1197. A daughter's son can perform it even if his maternal grand father has a son or sons living. It may be performed with or without piṇḍadāna (generally without it) and it may be per formed even if the daughter's son has not been invested with the sacred thread. The Śrāddhasāra nutes that the mātāmaha śrāddha is based only on the usage of śistas (p. 24).

Another is the 'Avidhayānavamiśrāddha', which is per formed for one's mother or other women of the family who died while the husbands were alive. It is performed on the 9thy of

the dark half of Bhādrapada. It ceases to be performed when the husband dies after the woman's death. The Nirnayasindhu notices several views about this and says that one should follow the usage of one's country 1198. According to the Mar kaṇḍeyapurāņa in this śrāddha not only a brāhmaṇa but also a woman whose husband is alive is to be fed and presents of a girdle, a garland and bangles are to be made to her.

It will have been seen from the translation of Aøv. gr., Yaj. and the Padmapurāṇa that daksina, according to one's ability, has to be given in each śrāddha towards the end of the rite. The Skandapurāṇa (VI. 218. 12-14) provides that what ever is wanting in mantras or the proper time or in procedure becomes pərfect by dakşiņā. Śrāddha without daksinā is like rain on an arid place or like dancing in the dark or like singing before a deaf person, that he who desires the permanent gratification of himself and his Manes should not offer a śrāddha without dakšiņā. The Rāmāyana shows how on the 12th day after the death of king Dasaratha gifts of jewels, of hundreds of cows, wealth, food in abundance and vehicles, of male and female slaves, of spacious houses were made to the brāhmaṇas. 1199 The Asramavāsikaparva (14. 3-4) recounts the valuable gifts to brāhmaṇas in honour of Bhisma, Drona, Duryodhana and other fallen warriors, adding that persons of all varpas were treated to profuse food and drink. The Vāyupurāņa (chapter 80 ) propounds in great detail the rewards of various kinds of gifts made in śrāddhas. From considerations of space those descriptions are passed over here and only a brief eulogy of the gift of cooked food is given in the note below.1200 The Santiparva (chap. 42.7)

states that while Yudhisthira performed the after-death cere monies of the fallen heroes he erected sabhās, prapās, water reservoirs and the like intending them for each separately. Devala states: 'when the brāhmaṇas have sipped water after dinner, dakşiņā is to be given' and Bphaspati prescribes

Dakşiņā should be given to all the brāhmaṇas according to the learning of them by means of (gifts of) cows, land, gold, clothes. He should do this in such a way that they feel satisfied; one who is well-off should do this specially. '1201 The Āývamedhika-parva (62. 2-5) states that Vasudeva offered śrāddha to his sister's son Abhimanyu and donated to sixty thousand brāhmaṇas, gold, cows, bed-steads, clothes and fed them. A special rule was provided by Brhaspati that the clothes, ornaments, bed-stead and the like, the horse and the like that were used by the father during his lifetime should be presented to the brāhmaṇa invited for śrāddha after honouring him with sandalwood paste and flowers.12014 The Anušāsana parva (chapt. 96 ) states the origin of the practice of giving an umbrella and sandals on the completion of a śräddha.

Something must be said about the gift of the bed-stead ( sayyā) used by the deceased on the 11th or 12th day after death. The Garudapurāņa (Pretakhanda 34. 69-89), Padma (srṣṭikhaṇḍa 10.12), the Matsyapurāņa highly eulogise the gift of sayyā to a brāhmaṇa and his wife. The Matsyapurāņa states that on the 2nd day after the end of impurity on death the performer (of śrāddha ) should donate a bed-stead possessing special characteristics; on it the golden image of the deceased should be placed and also fruits and clothes. After honouring a brāhmaṇa couple with many ornaments this should be done; then a bull should be let loose (for the benefit of the deceased) and the gift of a dark brown cow should also be made 1202 The Garudapurāņa (Pretakhanda 34.73-82) gives a more elaborate description which appears to be almost identical with the

verses of the Bhaviṣya quoted by Hemādri. The Bhaviṣya puräna quoted by Hemādri (and from Hemādri by the Nirnaya sindhu p. 596 ) states the mantra to be recited viz. just as the bed-stead of Krsna is never devoid of Laksmi, the daughter of the ocean, similarly my bed may not be empty in each birth that I may have to undergo. '1203 Acceptance of the gift of a sayyā was looked down upon in former times and even now it is only the poor brāhmaṇas (that are not generally learned) that accept this gift. The Padmapurāņa condemns the accept ance of the gift of sayyā in no measured terms. It says 'when a brāhmaṇa accepts the gift of a bed-stead, he should have to undergo the ceremony of upanayana again. In the Veda as well as in the Purāna (the gift of ) a bed-stead is everywhere condemned and all those who accept the gift go to hell.' 1204

Certain other matters connected with śrāddhas may be briefly touched upon. In very ancient times twelve kinds of sons were recognized out of whom the kşetraja, 1205 the putrikā putra and dattaka were most important. All these were the sons of two fathers. The question mooted was: to whom were they to offer piṇḍas? The Madanapārijāta (pp. 607-608) quotes a passage from the Hārīta-dharmasūtra 1206 and explains it. Hārīta says: 'seed does not grow without a field. Since it is seen that both are necessary the child born is the child of both. Out of the two (fathers ) the procreator is to be first invoked

1205. The ksetraja son was procreated on the wife or widow of a sonless man by a sagotra (a brother or other agnate) or even an asagotra accor ding to the rules of niyoga, the procreator being called bijin and the hus band on whose wife or widow the son was begotten was called ksetrin. The putrikāputra is of two kinds, (1) a sonless man gives his daughter in marriage to another with the stipulation that the son born of the marriage will be the son of the girl's father (Vas. 17. 17, Manu IX. 127); (2) A daughter herself may be made a son (Vas. 17. 16). A dattaka is a son whom his father or mother gives to another as a son confirming the gift with water (Manu IX, 168). Vide H. of Dh. vol.

(and then the kşetrin). He (the son) may offer two piņdas to each grade of the ancestors or he may offer a single piṇḍa (to the father and ) may repeat the names of both (fathers ) as to that single piṇḍa. The son of the son of two fathers ) may repeat two names as to the 2nd piṇḍa (i. e. the piņda for paternal grand-father ); the grand-son (of the son of two fathers ) may do the same as to the third piṇḍa (viz. the piṇḍa for paternal great-grandfather). Manu IV. 140 and Gobhila-smr̥ti II. 105 say about the putrikāputra 1207 that he presents the first piṇḍa to his mother (as she was appointed as a son), the 2nd to her father and the third to his father's father. This appears to be one order in which piṇḍas are to be offered by the putrikāputra, while Manu IX. 132 sets out another method since it says that a putrikāputra inherits the entire wealth of his own father if he is sonless and he gives two piṇḍas (i. e. performs two śrāddhas) for his own father and for his maternal grandfather. The Sān. Śr. S. provides 1208 that if there be two fathers, the son should recite the names of both (bijin and kşetrin ) with reference to the same piṇḍa. Even Yāj. says "The son procreated according to the rules of niyoga by a sonless man on the wife of another inherits the wealth of both and offers piņda to both.'1209 The Mit. adds that if a person appointed to procreate a son on another's wife has a son, then the son so begotten becomes the son of the kşetrin alone and not of the bijin. As the kşetraja and putrikā putra have beconie obsolete for several centuries the subject has only an academic interest now. But the dattaka is still in vogue and a few words must be said here about the persons to whom the dattaka offers piṇḍas. The Kalpataru quotes from the Pravarādhyāya a passage on this point which is as

follows: 1210 'If these (i. e. those who are bijin ) have no issue born of their own wives, (the sons begotten by niyoga or given in adoption ) should inherit their wealth and offer pipdas to them up to three ancestors; if both (the bijin and kşetrin or the giver and taker in adoption) have no other son, then they (sons begotten or adopted ) should offer piṇḍa to both; in one and the same śrāddha they should repeat (the names of) the two ancestors respectively (of the acceptor and that of the begetter) after having separately intended the same pipda for both up to the third ancestor.' The Baud. Dh. S. 1211 quotes a verse as follows The son of two fathers shall give the piṇḍa (to his two fathers and pronounce) two names with each piṇḍa ; three piṇḍas will thus serve for six persons (ancestors).' It would be seen from the passage quoted above from Hārīta that some authorities allowed two separate piṇḍas for each degree of ancestors when there were two in the same degree. Manu IX. 142 lays down the son given should not take the golra and wealth of his natural father; the piṇḍa follows the gotra and wealth; the svadhā (obsequies) of him who gives (his son in adoption) coase or fail (so far as that son is concerned).' This verse has been so interpreted by some decisions of the High Courts and of the Privy Council as to mean that the son adopted becomes totally severed from the family of his birth. This subject has been discussed at great length in H. of Dh. vol. III pp. 690-697 and it is established there that the severance of the son given in adoption is only partial, that the gotra of the natural family persists even after adoption into another family for purposes of marriage and āśauca and that the Nirņayasindhu, 1212 the Dharma-sindhu and the Dattaka candrikā declare that the son given away in adoption into another family can perform the śrāddha of his natural father,

He must drive away the bull together with the young cows in the north-eastern direction and give a pair of garments, gold and a vessel of bell metal to the hots (officiating priest). The blacksmith should be given wages as desired by him and food seasoned with a good deal of clarified butter should be served to (three) brāhmaṇas (at least). That 1219 pool at which a bull let loose (in honour of a deceased person by his son or the like) drinks water serves (reaches the manes. Wherever a bull (let loose) exulting in his strength scratches (or digs up) the earth, that earth becoming abundant food and water waits upon the manes." 1220 In the Anušāsanaparva the pitṛs are represented as saying that by letting loose a dark coloured bull, by offering water mixed with sesame and by lighting lamps in the rains a man becomes free from the debt he owes to the pitṛs (chap. 125. 73-74).

In the Garudapurāņa it is stated that the deceased person for whom a bull is not let loose on the 11th day after death permanently remains a preta, even if hundreds of bräddhas are offered for him. The same Purāpa further provides that if a bull be not available on the 11th day, then the effigy of a bull made of darbhas and flour or clay should be symbolically let loose 1221 In the Bhaviṣy apurāna the 12th day after death is prescribed for the letting loose of a bull (N. S. III, p. 505 ). The Nirņayasindhu says that the making of an effigy of a bull with clay, darbhas and flour is without authority. Even at present people let loose a bull but owing to the rise in the prices of bulls this is becoming less frequent, Several medieval digests such as the Pitrdayitā (pp. 84, 94), Śrāddhaviveka of Rudradhara ( pp. 69-77), Nirnayasindhu (III. pp. 595–596 ), Suddhiprakāśa

he should himself bathe his body with the water in) the jars with verses of Puruşasūkta and with pañcagavya and pure water and eat in the evening food mixed with sesamum grains together with clarified butter. He should give dinner to brāhmaṇas for the gratification of the servants of Yama. On the 4th day he burns (the effigy) with mantras. He should offer water and piṇḍa with the words 'piṇḍa to me of such and such a gotra for benefit in the next world; svadhā namah.' With these words he should bring to a close the rite. He should observe impurity for ten days for himself, but his agnates have not to observe impurity for him. On the 11th day he performs ekoddiṣṭa. They also cite the following verse 'one who is in distress, a woman and a südra having burnt one's body (i. e effigy) with mantras should perform all rites on that very day. This is the revela tion. In the case of women the rite is performed silently or with (?) Vedic mantras. In this way he should perform his own śrāddha every month for a year and at the end of each year up to twelve years. And then he should stop. When he is not able to do all these ( himself) his son and the like may perform them. They also recite the following verse; Although heirs may be alive-one may perform one's śrāddha while alive, having quickly set about doing everything according to the rules. except Sapiṇḍana. One should not make delay as to the time specified above, since life is evanescent '.".

It may be noted that the Baud. gļhyaśeşasūtra III. 22 contains a very brief procedure of the same rite, but therein two verses of Kanva and one of Vişņu are quoted. It appears that this is a later addition. The text of Baud. gṛhyaśeşasūtra III. 19 is quoted by Śr. Pr. pp. 361-363. But the Śrāddha prakāśa also quotes a long passage from the Lingapurāṇa and explains it (pp. 363-368). The procedure in the Lingapurāna. however, materially differs from that of Baudhāyana. It is passed over here from considerations of space. The Sraddha mayūkha also gives an elaborate description. Some of its provisions are stated here. In Jivat-śräddha the word preta: should nowhere be used. An effigy of the person is made with fifty kusas and is to be burnt by another with the mantra ‘kravyādam-agnim' (Ṛg. X. 16. 9). The person has to kindle fire on the banks of a river with his face to the south with his mTUR gṛhya fire or ordinary fire and has to dig up a pit and make bob prayer to the earth as in the case of an actual death.

Śrāddha to himself by one living

It contains a far more elaborate procedure than that of Baudhāyana and is in prose. It contains many of the provisions of Baudhāyana. Further details are passed over here.

The provision of a śrāddha for a living person offered by himself is a perversion of the ancient idea of śrāddha. The basic and fundamental conception of a śrāddha was to gratify the spirits of deceased ancestors. People had gone crazy with the idea of śrāddhas and invented this new mode to satisfy that craze. I have known persons that performed Jivat-śrāddha, though they had sons, younger brothers and nephews who would have certainly performed śrāddhas for them on their death.

It is customary to make a gift of a cow with a calf to a brāhmaṇa, preferably a kapilä сow, on the 2nd day after the period of āśauca. Often times this is the only cow given, and the cow called Vaitarani referred to above (p.183, note 427) is rarely donated in the midst of the sorrow and turmoil immediately on the death of a dear and near relative. A declaration is first made that a gift of a cow will be made and then water is poured on the hand of a brāhmaṇa. Then holding kušas in his hand the donor makes a gift of the cow with a formula noted below 1224 The donee replies with the words 'om svasti' (Yes, may it be well!). Then daksinā (in gold or silver coins ) is given and the brāhmaṇa says 'om svasti', holds the tail of the cow and repeats a Kāmastuti (eulogy of Kāma) 1225 according to the recension of the Veda he has studied. The Anušāsana parva ( 57. 28-29 ) eulogises the gift of a kapilā cow with the calf, given with a milking pail of bell-metal, whose horn tips are decked with gold, by stating that such a gift not only saves the donor in the other world but also his sons, grandsons and family for seven generations. The Anušāsanaparva (77.10 ff) sets out a legend why the kapilā cow is the best of all cows.

The Purāṇas and digests devote a good deal of space to śräddhas at tirthas and at Gayā. Vide Atri 55-58, Väyupurāņa 83. 16-42, Hemādri (on Śr.) pp. 1568 ff and 1575 ff. This sub ject will be briefly dealt with in the section on tirthas.

Much is said on the question whether śrāddhas should be performed in the intercalary month. The intercalary month is called by various names, viz. Malimluca (Kathaka Sam. 38. 14),1226 Samsarpa or Amhasaspati (Vaj.S:7.30 and 22.31), Mala māsa, Adhimāsa. An intercalary month is known even to the Rg veda (Ṛg. I. 25.8). The vendor of soma and the thirteenth month are condemned as pāpa (sinful) in the Aitareya Brāhmaņa 1227. The Parāṇas tried to bolster up the intercalary month by calling it Purusottama-masa (i. e. the month of Viṣṇu) but the original stigma attaching to the 13th month seems to have persisted. The general rule about an intercalary month is stated by the Grhyapariśiṣṭa : 1228 the month called Malimluca is polluted and springs from sin; it is condemned for all acts; it should be discarded in all rites in honour of gods and pitṛs. But exceptions to this sweeping prohibition have been recognized. Hārīta provides 1229 that all śrāddhas that come after Sapiṇḍana are not to be performed in an intercalary month, Vyāsa laid down 1230 that such ceremonies asjatakarma, annaprasana, the navašrāddhas, sraddha on Maghā and the thirteenth tithi, the sixteen śrāddhas, bath, gifts, japa and śrāddha at the time of the eclipse of the sun or moon-these should be performed even in an intercalary month. The Smrtimuktāphala concludes (p. 728 ) that there is no blemish in performing a śrāddha in an intercalary month provided it is to be performed before the end of one year from death. It is provided by Bhrgu 1231 that the sāmvatsarika śrāddha of those who die in an intercalary month

Śrāddha in intercalary month

may be performed in the intercalary month, but if there be none such then in the ordinary month of the same name. When the tithi for performing a śrāddha comes and there is then an intercalary month, Vĩddha-Vasistha says that śrāddha should be performed in both months, 1232

Further discussion about what may be done in Malamāsa and what is prohibited therein will be taken up in the section on Kāla. The question as to the day on which a śrāddha is to be performed if the tithi is spread over two days or if there is a kşaya of the tithi will also be discussed in that section.

Some of the works on śrāddha such as the Pșthvi-candro daya deal with what is called 'sanghāta-śrāddha.' 1232a When on the same day several persons die, but not at the same time, then the śrāddhas for them should be performed, as said by Rsyasrnga, in the order in which they died. But if five or six persons die at the same time on the same day (as when a vessel sinks in the sea or a market is burnt down all at once ), then the order in which śräddhas are to be performed is determined by the nearness of relationship to the performer of śrāddha in the case of each. For example, if a person's wife, son, brother and paternal uncle meet death at the same time, then the order should be this that the grāddha of the wife is performed first. then of the son, then of the brother and then of the uncle. If the parents die at the game time by accident, then the father's cremation or other rites should be first performed and then of the mother.

Provision is made if the performance of a śrāddha is rendered impossible by some obstacle. Rşyaśạnga provides 1233

if impurity (on death ) intervenes when a śrāddha is to be offered to the pitṛs, śrāddha should be offered at the end of the period of impurity. If an obstacle arises at the time when an ekoddiṣṭa is to be performed, the śrāddha should be performed in another month on the same tithi'. This last refers to a monthly śrāddha. If any of the sixteen śrāddhas fails owing to an obstacle it should be performed on the amāvāsyā or better still on the 11th day of the dark half. If there is an obstacle owing to impurity on death in the performance of a monthly śrāddha or yearly śrāddha it should be performed at the end of the impurity or on amāvāsyä. 1234 The Padmapurāņa (Pätālakhanda 101. 68-70) provides similar rules. If the obstacle is the performer's illness or his inability to collect materials or his wife being in her monthly illness, he may offer āmaśrāddha described above.

It may be noted that while great emphasis was laid on inviting a very learned brāhmaṇa at a śrāddha, that object was often frustrated in practice by the provisions made in certain smr̥tis that one 1235 should not partake of śrāddha food for three years after sapiṇḍana (which is often one year after death) and that by dining at a śräddha in the first year one eats the bones and marrow of the deceased, in the second year his flesh. in the third year his blood and śräddha in the 4th year is (somewhat ) pure. Vide Par. M. vol. II part 1 p. 423, where smr̥ti passages prescribing prāyaścittas for partaking of food at various śrāddhas including sāmvatsarika are set out. Harita says: one partaking of food at Navaśrāddha should undergo Candrāyana, the Prājāpatya for dining at a monthly śrāddha and fast for one day for dining at a pratyābdika śrāddha. This is on the same lines as acceptance of gifts. A donor collected merit by making gifts, but it was for the acceptor to decide whether he should accept gifts. The ideal

High ideal for brāhmaṇas

placed before brāhmaṇas was that one, though entitled to accept gifts on account of his vedic learning and tapas, should not accept gifts, if he desires to secure the highest world (Yāj. I. 213), while Manu IV. 186 affirms 1236 that though entitled to accept gifts a brāhmaṇa should not again and again resort to that method, since the spiritual power that he acquires by Vedic study is lost by accepting gifts. Manu IV. 85-86 (= Padma V. 19. 236-237) say that acceptance of a gift from the king is terrible (in its consequences) and Padma warns that gift appears sweet like honey but is like poison (i.e. deadly in its effects). This reasoning applied with greater force to officiating and dining at a śrāddha, where not only gifts are to be received, but also sumptuous food that will please the palate is served in abundance.

It has been seen above how the most ancient literary monument, viz. the Ṛgveda, shows that the funeral rites per formed immediately after death were prompted by affectionate concern for the departed spirit mingled with some element of fear, that the object of those rites was to provide sustenance to the departed spirit and to endow it with an intermediate body before it became one of the pitṛs. It has also been found that in the most ancient times of which we have literary evidence, there were rites for the worship of ancestors, being the Pinda pitṛyajña performed every month on amāvāsyā, the Mahāpitṛ yajña performed in the Sākamedha and the Astakā śrāddhas. Gradually the rites for deceased ancestors became more and more frequent, all-inclusive and elaborate, so that ultimately an exaggerated importance came to be attached to the cult of śrāddhas over which there was an enormous expenditure of time, effort and wealth. The question now arises what Indians of the 20th century should do about śrāddhas. One finds that in these days when many brāhmaṇas even do not engage in any of the five daily obligatory yajñas (the pañca-yajñas), they are so licitous to offer śrāddha at least once a year to their ancestors. The following may be therefore suggested as a via media for all kinds of people. Those who have faith in the duty of performing śräddhas and their efficacy for the benefit of

the dead may perform them on a small scale, bearing in mind the emphatic admonition of Manu (III. 125-126 ), the Kūrmapurāṇa II. 22. 27, Padmapurāna V. 9. 98 1237 that one should desist from extravagance in the matter of śrāddhas, particularly in the number of brāhmaṇas to be invited. Those whose faith is shaken or shattered by the onrush of modern ideas and English education or firm belief in the doctrines of karma and punarjanma should also remember one thing. The main underlying conception of śrāddha is certainly admirable, viz, a tender and affectionate regard for one's near and dear relatives. It is a good practice to set apart at least one day in a year for the remembrance of one's near and dear relatives that are no more, to invite relatives, friends, and learned people to a dinner in memory of the dead and to bestow monetary gifts on poor but learned persons of character and devoted to the practice of plain living and high thinking. This will be in keeping with our past traditions and will also give a new orientation to and infuse new life into practices and usages that have become lifeless and meaningless to many people.
