<p>EKODDISTA AND OTHER SRADDHAS</p>
<p>Having dealt at great length with Parvanaśrāddba which is the inodel of all śrāddhas it is now time to speak of Ekoddista śrāddha that is a modification of Parvanaśraddha 1150 The word Ekoddista means that in which only one deceased person 1152 ja intended (to be invoked or benefited)'. The Pārvana śrāddha is intended for three paternal ancestors and is thus distinguished from Ekoddista. In San gr. IV. 2Baud. gr. III, 12.6, the Sraddhasūtra of Katyāyana (kandika 4), and Yā). I. 251-252, the points of difference between the two are Clearly set out,1152 In this sraddha only one arghya is offered, there is only one pavitra and only one pinda 18 offered, there is no āvāhana (as there is in Pārvana), no agnau luvana, there are no brālmanas invited to represent the Vißve-devas; the question about being satiated by the dinner is to be asked in the word &lsquo;svaditam (did it taste well) and the brāhmanas reply with &lsquo;susyaditam&rsquo;) (it had excellent taste) instead of saying &lsquo;may it be in exhaustible,&rsquo; the formula here used 18 &lsquo;May it approach&rsquo; (or wait upon the deceased person), when the brāhmapes are sent away at the end of the dinner the word used is &lsquo;be satisfied (or delighted) and they reply &lsquo;we are delighted.&rsquo; The Viṣṇu. purāna (UT 13, 23-26) and Mārkandeya (28 8-11) closely follow the Sraddhasūtra and Yāj. According to San gr. (IV. 2. 7), 1153</p>

<p>Manu TIL, 257, Mārkandeya (28. 11), Yāj. I. 256 and others, for one year after the death of a twice-born person till the sapindīkarada śrāddha is performed this is the way in which grāddha is to be performed for the preta every month. The Viṣṇudharmasūtra 21.2 provides that suitable changes (ūha) should be made in the mantras employed (e.g instead of &lsquo;atra pitaro madayadhyam&rsquo; the mantra should be &lsquo;atra pitarmādayas va&rsquo; (O father | 1154 regale thyself here ). In Ekoddista such a formula as &lsquo;ye ca tvām-anu&rsquo; (those that come after thee) can not be employed and the word &lsquo;pitr&rsquo; is not to be employed (till gapindikarana is performed), but the word &lsquo;preta&rsquo; (Aparārka P. 525 quoting Saunaka-grhyaparisista) 1155</p>
<p>As seen above (p 262, note 591a) Ekoddista śrāddhas are of three kinds, nava, navamiśra and purāpa Navaśrāddhas are those that are performed till the 10th orlith day after death, navamisras (or miśras) are those that are performed after the 11th day till one year (or six months, according to some) after death. Aparārka quotes a verse from Vyāghra 1156 that Ekoddista-śrāddha is performed on the 11th day, on the 4th day, at the end of each month for a year after death and every year on the day of death and a verse of Kātyāyana that (ekoddista) śrāddha should be performed for one who had kept sacred fires on the 11th day after the day of cremation and that the Dhruva śrāddhas should always be performed on the day of death. Aparārka explains &lsquo;Dhruvāni&rsquo; as meaning those that are performed after three fortnights from death. About the navaśraddha there is again a diveigence of views. One meaning has already been given above on p 262 note 593. The Skandapurāpa VI (Nāgarakhanda) 205. 1-4 and Garuḍapurāna (pretakhanda 5. 67-69 ) state that navaśrāddhas are nine viz. the three performed where a man died, where the funeral pro cession rested on the way and where the burnt bones were collected and six more performed on the 5th, 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, and 11th days after death.</p>

<p>[Vol. Numerous works lay down that there are sixteen śrāddhas which must be performed for a deceased person and that if these are not performed then his spirit is not freed from the condition of being a preta and a pośāca 1157 There is a great deal of diver gence of views about what these sixteep śrāddhas are, some works including sapindįkarapa among the 16, others excluding it therefrom, Gobhilasmrti III 67 enumeratesi15s the 16 as follows: The twelve monthly śrāddhas (performed every month on the ththi of death), the first (i. e. the sraddha on the 11th day), two śrāddhas on (a day prior to the expiry of) every six months from the tithi of death and sapindikarada are the sixteen śrāddhas, The Garuḍapurāna 1159 refers to three groups of sixteen, one of which enumerates the 16 śrāddbas as those performed on the 12th day (after death), after three fort nights, after six months, after every month and at the end of the year, thile the Padmapurāna 1160 enumerates them as follows: the sixteen sraddhas are those performed on the 4th day after death, at the end of three fortnights, after six months, after a year and twelve śrāddhas performed each month (on the tith of death) The Kalpataru p.25 and Brahmapurana g. by Apararka (p. 523) state that the 16 sraddhas are those performed on 4th, 5th, 9th and 11th days after death and the twelve monthly śrāddhas (on the tithi of death 1161 ).

<p>Views on sitteen frāddhas</p>
<p>519</p>
<p>others say that after performing the 16 śrāddhas according to the procedure for Ekoddista śrāddhas sapindana should be performed. 1162 The Madanapārijāta (p. 615 ), the Nirnaya sindhu (III. p. 599) and others say that in this conflict of views one should follow the usage of one&rsquo;s country, Vedic Sakhā or family. There were two views about the śrāddha on the 11th day. It should be remembered that Yaj. III. 22 jaid down impurity on death for 10, 12, 15 and 30 days respectively for the four varpas, One view espoused by Saṅkha and Paithi. pasi was that in spite of the days of impurity not being over śrāddha must be performed on the 11th day (and for the moment the performer becomes pure for that purpose ). The other view was that of the Matsyapurana and Viṣṇudbarmasūtra 21.1 that the first śrāddha (okoddista ) was to be performed on the expiry of āśauca,</p>
<p>In the case of ascetics dying it is provided by Uśanas 1163 that by the fact of their taking to the order of sannyāsa (of the ekadandi kind in the Kaliyuga) they have not to undergo the condition of being preta, no Ekoādısta nor Sapindikarana should be performed for them by their son or other rolative but only pārvanaśraddha on the 11th day and every year thereafter, Sātātapa provides 1164 that no Ekoddista, no water, no pinda and no cremation rites should be offered to an ascetia nor mourning should be observed, but pārvada-śrāddha should be performed. Pracetas quoted by Mit, on Yāj 1. 256 states that no ekoddista is to be performed for an ascetic nor sapindi karapa, but only pārvana on the day of death every year in Bhadrapada dark half. The Śivapurada (Kailasa-samhita) chapters 22 and 23 deal with the rites to be performed on an ascetic&rsquo;s death on the 11th and 12th days,</p>
<p>In the Navaśrāddhas no incense, no lamps are employed. All mantras having the words &lsquo;pitr&rsquo; and &lsquo;syadhā namah&rsquo; are</p>

<p>[Vol. omitted and so is tho word &lsquo;anu&rsquo; omitted and there is no jam and no recital of mantras in the hearing of the brābmanos, As stated in the Brahmapurana, the śrāddhas performed in the house at the ond of impurity on the 12th day, at the end of a month etc. are called ekoddista. It follows that the rites cailed navagrāddhas offered during the days of impurity are per formed at the place of death or in the cemetery or at a place whoro wntor and pinda are offered (and not in the house ), vido Sm, C. (aśauca p. 176 ). In the navamióra śraddha mantrag aro employed according to some. In former times and now also all tho 16 śróddhas aro performed on the 11th day. Hardly any one waits for ono year to perform Sapipdikarada. In former times it was laid down (e. g. by the Mit ) that in times of difficulty, Sapindikarana should be performed even before a yoar elapses after performing the sixteen śrāddhas. But now this cxcoption has become the rule.</p>
<p>Sapindīkarana or Sapindana is the reception of a deceased person into the community of pitrs to wbom pindas are offered. Soreral times were prescribed by apoient works for this. A.co to tho Kausitaki gr. IV. 2 this śrāddha could be performed after tlo doath of the deceased at the end of a year or at the opd of throo fortnights or on the happening of a lucky opent (like the birth of a son or a marriage), The Bhāradvāja1165 gr (III 17) allowed it at the end of a year (after death) or in the 11th or 6th or 4th month or on the 12th day. The Baud. Pitroedhasūtra II 1%.1 mentions five times for sapibdikarapa viz one year, 11th, 6th or 4th month or 12th day. The Garuḍapurāna (Pretakhanda 6 53-54) states the time of Sapindīkarana to be one year, six months, three fortnights, the 12th day or on a lucky occasion, The Vispupurada (DL, 13. 26£) makes similar provisions about sapindikarana (which is an ekoddista śrāddha). Apararka (p. 540) after a long discussion holds that there are three times for a performer who is an āhtāgni viz 12th day, some day between the end of aśauca&rsquo; and the first amāvāsyā (after death) or the first apāvāsyā after asauca ends and prescribes four times for one who has not kept sacred fires, viz &amp; year, six months, three fortnights or when a lucky event occurs.

<p>The time for Sapindikarana</p>
<p>521</p>
<p>commended (for the sapindana śrāddha) because family usages are innumerable, because man&rsquo;s life is short and because the body is evanescent. The Visou Dh S. (21.20) provides that for sūdras 12th day after death is the only day for Sapindī. karada (but without Vedic mantras). Gobhila laid down that after Sapindīkarapa was performed, there was to be no per formance of śrāddhas every month, but Gautama (or Saunaka, according to Aparārke p 543) held the view that they may be performed according to the procedure of ekoddista śrāddbas, Bhattoji says 1166 that when sapipdikarana is performed before the end of the year, then all the sixteen śrāddhas must be per formed before Sapiodikarana, yet the monthly śrāddhas should again be performed at their proper times for one year. Yaj. I. 255 and Vispu Dh. S. 21. 23 prescribe that even if Sapibdi. karana is performed for a deceased person within less than a year from death still for one year food and a jar of water should be given to a brābmapa for the whole year (for the benefit of the deceased). Uśanas provides that even if the heirs of a deceased person are divided in wealth, still the naraśrāddhas, the sixteen śrāddhas, and sapindīkarapa must be performed by one alone 1167 (e. g. the eldest son), but Pracetas provides that when a year has (elapsed ) śrāddha may be performed separately by each heir 1168,</p>
<p>The procedure of Sapindana or Sapipdikarana is des cribed in numerous works such as the San, gr. V. 9, Kausi taki gr.

Four vessels for arghya should be got ready and filled with sandal wood paste, water and sesamum grains, one being for the deceased (the meta) and three for his paterna) ancestors, two daiva brāhmanas should be invited, one to represent the preta and three to represent the three paternal ancestors of the prela; if a man is unable to invite so many brahmanas, be should invite three, one for Viśvedevas, one for the pieta and one for the three paternal ancestors. He should request &lsquo;I shall unite the vessel for the preta with the vessels for his thres paternal ancestors&rsquo; When permitted in the words do unite&rsquo;, he should cast the kuśas in the vessel for the preta into the vessels for his three paternal ancestors, should keep a little water mixed with kuśas in the vessel for the preta and distribute the rest of the water froin the preta vessel into the three vessels for his ancestors with the two mantras 11*** &lsquo;ye samāna&rsquo; (Vā), S. 19, 45-46) Arglya is offered to the brahmana representing the preta with the water that remains in the preta vesse), arghya is offered to the three patria brahmanas from the three pitrya Vessels. Four pindas should be prepared, one for the prela and three for his ancestors and then the performer requests *I shall unite the protapinda with the pindas for the three ancestor&rsquo;s of his&rsquo;; when permitted in the words &lsquo;do unite &lsquo;, tha performer divides the pretapinda into three parts and puts each third into each of the three pindas with the same tio mantras (Vāy. S 19. 45-46). The Garuḍapurana (1, 220,6 ) strikes a discordant note in that it states that the pretapında is to be divided in two parts, each of which is to be placed inside tho pindas for pitamala and prapitāpaha only.</p>

<p>Śapindikarana</p>
<p>523</p>
<p>Sapiodikarana partakes of the character of both ekoddista and pārvana, the first applying to the preta and the 2nd to the threa ancestors of the preta, so that in it two kinds of śrāddhas are combined. When the sapindikarana rite is completed by the giving of daksinā to the brahmanas, then the preta ceases to be so and himself becomes a pitr. The status of being a preta involves the experiencing of great torments due to hunger and thirst and becoming a pity means being brought in contact with the traddha devatas called Vasu, Rudra and Aditya.1170 The word preta has two meanings, (1) a person who is dead and (2) one who being dead has not the sapindikarana performed for him The result of sapindana is that the 1171 great-grandfather of the deceased whose sapindana is performed drops out from the list of pitrs, entitled to pipda and becomes one called &ldquo;lepablāk&rsquo; (entitled to only wipings of the hand) and the former preta becomes one of the pitrs and entitled to participate in the pindag offered at a pārvavaśraddha thereafter. As stated in the Garuḍapurāna I 220, 2 the sapindikarana-śrāddha is to be perforined like the pāryana in the afternoon.</p>
<p>It may be noted that in some works the mantras recited at the time of pouring the water from the preta vessel into the pitr Vessels are different For example, the Viṣṇu Dh. S. 21. 14 sayg1172 the mantras are &lsquo;Samsrjatu tvā prthivi&rsquo; (May, the earth unite thee) and &lsquo;samāni va ākutiḥ&rsquo; (Rg. X. 191. 4), while the</p>

<p>Grhya-parisista 1173 of Aśv, employs the three Madhumati yergas (Rg. I 90,6-8) and the three fine verses at the end of the Rigveda beginning with &lsquo;sangacchadhvam&rsquo; (Rg. X 191. 2-4, &lsquo;May you unita&rsquo; &amp;o.). .</p>
<p>Yaj. (1 254) and Markandeya (28. 17-18) provide that Ekoddista and Sapindīkatana Graddhas are performed for women also (but, not pārvana nor abhyudayika), About the Sapindikarana of the mother there are somewhat conflicting dicta. If a woman dies sonless and her husband is alive, her sapindana is effected with her mother-in-law (Gobhilasmrti II, 102). If a woman dies leaving no son and the husband also 18 dead, then no sapindana can be performed for her. If she died either on the funeral pyre of her husband 1194 or afterwards (as a Satz ) then her son should perform her sapindana with her husband (1, e. the son&rsquo;s father) and there is no separate sapin dana for her. If she was married in the asura form or she was made a putrikā, then the son should perform his mother&rsquo;s sapin dana with his maternal grandfather; while &amp; son born of a woman married in the Brahma and three other proper forms may perform her sapindana with her husband or the paternal grandmother or the maternal grandfather. In the case of these three alternatives if there is a certain family usage that should be followed; otherwise there is an option. If a woman has a step-son, the latter should perform her sapindana with his father, as Manu IX. 183 ( Vas, 17. 11) indicates. Vide the Mit on Yāj I. 253-254 and Sra. C. (on zsauca p 169) for discus sion of these points and for various alternatives 1175</p>

<p>he died, but if he was more than five years old then the 16 śrāddhas are performed for him (though not sapindana) and pinda is offered on bare ground. It may be noted that no auspicious rite like marriage in which abhyudayika śrāddha is necessary can be performed until the sapindana of a deceased person of the family has been effected (except in the case of such absolutely necessary ceremonies as simantonnayana).</p>
<p>Manu (V. 89-90) prescribes that no water and other rites like sapindīkarapa are offered and performed for those who had left off their faith, who were born of condemned mixed marriages, who entered ascetic orders, who had committed suicide (by hanging, poison &amp;c.), who had embraced heretical doctrines, for women that wilfully seek illicit connection with men, that did harm to their foetus or husband (were guilty of abortion and murder of husband) and that were addicted to drinking sura. Yāj. II. 6 contains similar provisions. It has to be noted that every kind of suicide is not condemned by the ancient smrtis. Vide H, of Dh. vol. III, pp. 939, 958–9 for cases where suicide was not condemned. Except in those cases Yama (g by the Mit. on Yāj. III, 6) provides that in the case of the persons mentioned in Manu and Yāj, there is to be no āśauca observed, no water oftered, no tears shed, no cremation and no last rites. The Mit. (on Yāj, NI, 6) quotes Vrddha Yājāavalkya and Chāgaleya that in the case of those who are guilty of condemned suicide the procedure of Nārā yapabali should be resorted to after a year and then sraddha may be offered to them. Then the Mit. describes at length the pro cedure of Nārāyanabali. Vide note 838 b p. 370 above for the Skandapurāpa, Nagarakhanda 219, 19-21 on the view that śrāddha may be performed on the 14th of the dark half for per sons who committed suicide or who met a violent death.</p>
<p>The Abhyudayıka-śrāddha is to be now described. Asv. gr. IV. 7 mentions in one place only four sraddhas viz. Pārvana, Kāmya, Abhyudayika and Ekoddista (note 966 above). Many of tle sutras such as Āsv. gr. I. 5. 13-15, Sat, gr. IV. 4, Gobhija gr. IV, 3. 35-37, Kausitaki gļ, IV, 4, Baud. gr. III. 12. 2-5, the Srāddhasūtra of Katyāyana (kandikā 6 ) briefly describe this srāddha. According to most of these sutras this śrāddha is performed when there is a lucky event such as the birth of a son, or his caula, upanayana or marriage or there is the commencement of a charitable (purta) act (such as the dedication of a well or a tank or a park to the public), Āýv.</p>

<p>{ Vol. gr, and Gobhila gr. are very brief. They say that in this sraddha performed on auspicious ocoasions or on the under taking of meritorious acts an even number of brālimapas is to be fod, that the rite is to be performed from left to right and that yavas barley) are to be used instead of gesamum grains, As this Srāddha is only a modification (Vikrti) of pārvana ( as said by Aparārka . 514) all rules of the latter will be applicable to the former except where special directions are given. The Aśv. gr. pariśista II. 19, Smrtyarthasāra (1. 56), Pitrdayita pp. 62-71 give a compact but tolerably full description of this sraddha.</p>
<p>In this sraddha which is to be performed in the morning (oxcept on the birth of a son when it is to be done at once ) the Vißve-devas are called Satya and Vasu, it is porformed in tho</p>
<p>• forenoon, the brālimanas to be invited must be oven in number, the darūlias are to be straight (and not doublefolded) and are not to bo with their roots; the performer wears his sacred thread in the usual form (and not in the pracinūvita form), all actions are to be done from Loft to right (pradaksinan and not prusavyam); the word svadha is not to be used; yava grains are to bo omployed instead of sesamum grains, he invites then with tho words &ldquo;find time to attend Nandiśrāddha&rsquo;. The brālimanas say be it so. To says &lsquo;May you two come to my houso ); they reply &lsquo;wo two shall come&rsquo;. The performer faces the east or north (but never the south); the mantra about yavas is &lsquo;yavosi&rsquo; (vide note 966 ) 1976 he requests &lsquo;I shall invoke the pitrs called Nāndimukha : 1197 When pormitted by the Brāhmapas in the words &lsquo;do invoke&rsquo; le says &lsquo;may tho Nandīmukha pitra be ploased&rsquo;; he offers arghya only once with the words &lsquo;O Nāndipukla pitrsthis is the arguya for you&rsquo;.

<p>brābmanas are eating the dinner, the Rāksoghna mantras and mantras addressed to Indra and propitiatory mantras may be recited but not the mantras addressed to pitrs (viz. Rg. X, 15. 1-13); when he sees that the brāhmanas aro satiated, he recites the five verses (Rg. IX. 11.1-5) beginning with &lsquo;upāsniai gayatā narah&rsquo; (O men) sing for this soma) instead of the Madhumati verses (viz, Rg. I. 90. 6-8) and at the end he makes the brālmapas hear the mantra &lsquo;the pitrs have partaken ( of the food), they have regaled themselves&rsquo;. The performer should ask &lsquo;I shall request the nāndimukha pitrs to utter benedictions&rsquo; at the stage where (in Pārvapa) aksayyodaka&rsquo; is asked for, to which the brāhmabas respond with the words &lsquo;do request.&rsquo; The performer employs the word &lsquo;sampannam&rsquo; (was it perfect) in asking about the gratification of the brāhmapas, who reply with the word &lsquo;susampangam&rsquo; (it was quite perfect). On the brālimadas sipping water after their dinner, he covdungs the places where the dinner was taken, strews darbha grass thereon with their tips turned towards the east and offers thereon two pindas for (each of the ancestors) made with the food that remains after the brāhmanas have eaten mixed with curds, jujube fruit and prsadajya 1178 (mixture of curds and clarified. butter). The pindas are offered to the mātrs, to the three paterna) ancestors and the three maternal ancestors (viz. mother&rsquo;s father, mother&rsquo;s paternal grandfather and her paternal great-grandfather). Some do not offer pindas in this śrāddha (as stated by Āśy. gr, parisista II, 19). The Pitrdayitā and Srāddha-tattva (Jiv. p. 297) say that no mātrśrāddha is to be performed in Abhyudayıkaśrāddha by the followers of the Sāmaveda. It is possible that the sraddha for the mother, paternal grandażother and paternal great-grandmother was inspired by the Anvastakya śrāddha, as the sātras from ĀŚv. gr. quoted below will indicate 11784</p>
<p>The words Nandißrāddha and Viddhisraddha are synony mous When Yāj I. 250 says117) that the Nāndimukha pitrs should be worshipped with pindas when there is vrddhi (a lucky or auspicious event), he indicates that Nāndiśrāddba and Vrddhi</p>

As noted by the Mit, on Yāj. 1. 250 quoting Sātātapa tbis sraddha is made of three parts, viz. mātr-śrāddha, pitrśrāddha and mātāmahaśrāddha, &ldquo;80 On the other hand the Bhaviṣya-purada I 185. 15 states that there are two śrāddhas in this viz Mātr-śrāddha and Nandimnkha-piti śrāddha. Abhyudayika-śrāddha and Vrddhjśrāddha are treated as synonyms in some works such as the Padmapurāna, 1191 though it may be said that Abhyudayika śrāddha is wider in import than Vrddhiśraddha, since it is also applicable to sraddha performed on the commencement of a purta act.</p>
<p>The Vispupurāṇa III, 13, 2-7, Markandega 28, 4–), Padmaa purana (srsti 9. 194–199), Bhaviṣyapurāba I 185. 5-13, the Vispudharmottara I 142. 13-18 describe briefly the procedure of Nāndiśrāddha and also the occasions on which it is to be per formed. The occasions specified are 1182: on the marriages of song and daughters, on entering a new house, on naming &amp; child, at the time of Cūdākarma, at Simantonnayana, on the birth of &amp; son, &amp; householder should honour the group of pitrs called Nandi mukha. The Mārkandeya-purāna 28. 6 notes that some desire that this śrāddha should not have Vaiśvadeva brāhmanas, but the Padmapurāna srstikhanda 9.195 ) says that in this viddhi śraddha the mothers are to be first honoured, then the fathers, then the mātāmabas and then the Vitre-devas Hemādri (śr. P. 107) quotes two yerses from the Brahmapurāpa to the effect that the father, paternal grandfather and paternal great-grand father are called aérumukha pitrs, while the three paternal ancestors beyond the great-grandfather are called Nāndīmukha pitrs.8183 The Kalpataru (on śrāddha p 270) explains these verses as meaning no more than this that in case the three paternal ancestors of a man are living and there is a lucky orent, then the devatās for Nāndiśrāddha in his case would be the three</p>

<p>(Vol. laid down that in the case of one&rsquo;s parents this śrāddha par takes of the character of pārvana. 11861 The Bhaviṣya-purada and Skanda state that the Samvatsarika sraddha is the most eminent among srāddhas and that if a son does not perform the yearly graddha of his parents on the day of death he goes to the horrible Hell called Tamisra and then is born as a pig in a town, 1187 In connection with this, if the tithi or month of death or both are not known then Brhaspati, the Skandapurāda, Padma and Bhaviṣyapurāna lay down certain rules, viz 1188 (1) if the tithz is known but the month is not known, then the śrāddba should be performed on that tithi in the month of Mārgasirsa or Māgha; (2) if the month is known but the tithi is not known, then the śrāddha should be performed on the amāvāsyā of the month; (3) if both the tithi and the month are not known, then one should take the tithi and the month when the deceased started from home; (4) if even the day and mouth of starting be not known, then the tithi and month in which a person bears of the death of a relative should be taken, It is to be noted that the month in pitrya rites is lunar and the words &lsquo;dina, ahah, võsara&rsquo; in connection with pitrya rites mean ' tithi&rsquo; (Aparārka p. 545).

<p>The Mahālayasrāddha best of daksipās. If it is not possible to perform the śrāddba in the dark half (when the Sun is in Kanyā), one may perform it when the Sun is in Tulā (Balance). When the Sun enters the sign of Scorpion (without a śrāddha being performed), the Fathers go away losing all hope and after pronouncing a terri ble curse (on their descendants) they return to their abode.&rsquo; 1189 The fifth fortnight from the Full Moon day of Āṣāḍha is the dark half of Bhadrapada. The dark half is the preserve of pitrs. In Bhādrapada the Sun is in the middle of its apparent motion in daksināyana. Therefore the dark half of Bhadrapada is specially chosen as the best period for śrāddha to the pitrs i, e. for the Mahalaya The śrāddha performed in Bhadrapada dark half is called Mahālaya-śrāddha, since that fortnight is the abode (alaya) as it were of the maha ( i. e. festival day ) for &lsquo;pitrs, The real idea is that the dark half of Bhādrapada is specially to be welcomed for a śrāddha when the Sun is in Kanya during that fortnight and that even if the Sun is not in Kanya the dark half of Bhadrapada is still a good time for a srāddha to the pitrs. The Skandapurana 1190 also says &lsquo;In the fifth fort night from the Full Moon of Āṣāḍha, when the Sun Occupies the sign of Kangā, the pitrs of him who offers a śrāddha on the tithi of the death (of one&rsquo;s father) certainly derive gratification for one year thereafter.&rsquo; The Kalpataru quotes the Bhaviṣya purāpa to the effect that if a man has not performed śrāddha in</p>

Various views are held on the question of the exact day on which the Mahālayasraddha is to be performed, viz, it may be performed on any day from the first tathi of the dark half of Bhadrapada to the amāvāsyā or from the fifth of the dark half to the amavasyā of Bhadrapada or from the 8th or 10th of the dark half to amāvāsya or from the 5th of the dark half of Bhadrapada to the 5th of the next fort night or on any day on which the Sun is in Kadyā or on any day till the Sun enters Scorpion. 119 Prajāpati states that there&rsquo; are numerous srāddhas described by the Puranas, a]] of them yield rewards but the Mahalaya (śrāddha) is the most eminent among thein, 1193</p>

<p>In the Mahalayaśrāddha the Viśvedevas are Dhuri and Locana, This śrāddha is performed for the benefit not only of the paternal and maternal ancestors with their wives, but also for other relatives and persons that are dead (together with their wives, sons and husbands if these be dead) viz one&rsquo;s step mother, one&rsquo;s wife, gon, daughter, paternal uncle, maternal uncle, brother, paternal aunt and maternal aunt, sister, paternal uncle&rsquo;s son, son-in-law, sister&rsquo;s son, father-in-law, mother-in law, ācārya, upādhyāya, guru, friend, pupil and any other relative. 1196 Some perform only for the paternal ancestors with their wives and the maternal ancestors with their wives. The day on which the moon is in Bharani naksatra in the dark half of Bhādrapada is called Mahābharani and śrāddha performed on that day is said to be equal to Gayāśrāddha (Matsyapurāna g. by Sr, K, L P 99) The Mahālaya-śrāddha is to be performed on the 12th tithi of Bhadrapada dark half in the case of a sannyāsin and on no other tithi and his yearly śrāddha is to be performed by his son according to pāryapa method as in the case of householders. The dvādaśī is sacred to Visou and yatis always repeat the words &lsquo;namo Nārāyanaya&rsquo; and therefore the 12th is the special tithi for the mahālaya śrāddha of yatis, The Mahālayaśrāddha is not to be performed in an intercalary month (malamāsa).</p>
<p>Two more śrāddhas that are performed even to this day may be mentioned here. One is called “Mātāmabaārāddha&rsquo; or &lsquo;Dauhitra-pratipad-śrāddha&rsquo;. A daughter&rsquo;s son whose parents are alive can alone perform a sraddha for his maternal grand-father (together with the maternal grand-mother if she also be dead) on the first tithi of the bright half of Asyina 1197, Å daughter&rsquo;s son can perform it even if his maternal grand father has a son or sons living It may be perforined with or without pindadāna (generally without it) and it may be per formed even if the daughter&rsquo;s son has not been invested with the sacred thread, The Srāddhasāra notes that the mātāmaba. śrāddha is based only on the usage of śistas (p. 24),</p>
<p>Another is the &lsquo;Avidhayānavamiśrāddha&rsquo;, which is per formed for one&rsquo;s mother or other women of the family who died while the husbands were alive. It is performed on the 9th of</p>

<p>the dark half of Bhadrapada. It ceases to be performed when the busband dies after the woman&rsquo;s death, The Nirdayasindbu notices several views about this and says that one should follow the usage of one&rsquo;s country 1198. According to the Mar kandeyapurāna in this śrāddha not only a brāhmana but also a woman whose husband is alive is to be fed and presents of &amp; girdle, &amp; garland and bangles are to be made to her.</p>
<p>It will have been seen from the translation of Abv. gr., Yaj and the Padmapurana that daksinā, according to one&rsquo;s ability, has to be given in each sraddha towards the end of the rite. The Skandapurana (VI. 218. 13-14) provides that what ever is wanting in mantras or the proper time or in procedure becomes perfect by daksina. Srāddha without daksidā is like rain on an arid place or like dancing in the dark or like singing before a deaf person, that he who desires the permanent gratification of himself and his Manes should not offer &amp; śrāddha without daksidā. The Ramayana shows how on the 12th day after the death of king Dasaratha gifts of jewels, of hundreds of cows, wealth, food in abundance and vehicles, of male and female slaves, of spacious houses were made to the brahmavas, 1199 The Asramayāsikaparva (14 3-4) recounts the valuable gifts to brābmanas in honour of Bhisma, Dropa, Duryodhana and other fallen warriors, adding that persons of all vardas were treated to profuse food and drink The Vayupurana (chapter 80 ) propounds in great detail the rowards of various kinds of gifts made in śrāddhas From considerations of space those descriptions are passed over here and only a brief eulogy of the gift of cooked food is given in the note below. 1200 The Santiparva (chap 42.7)</p>

He should do this in such a way that they feel satisfied, one who is well-off should do this specially. &lsquo;1201 The Ābvamedhika-parya (6. 2-5) states that Vasudeva offered śrāddha to his sister&rsquo;s son Abhimanyu and donated to sixty thousand brāhmanas, gold, cows, bed-steads, clothes and fed them. A special rule was provided by Brhaspati that the clothes, ornaments, bed-stead and the like, the horse and the like that were used by the father during his lifetime should be presented to the brāhmana invited for śrāddha after honouring him with sandalwood paste and flowers, 1201a The Anuśāsana parya (chapt. 96 ) states the origin of the practice of giving an umbrella and sandals on the completion of a grāddha,</p>
<p>Something must be said about the gift of the bed-stead (sayyā) used by the deceased on the 11th or 12th day after death. The Garuḍapurāda (Pretakhanda 34, 69–89), Padma (srstikhanda 10. 12), the Matsyapurāna highly eulogise the gift of sayyā to a brāhmapa and his wife. Tho Matsyapurāpa states that on the 2nd day after the end of impurity on death the performer (of śrāddha ) should donate a bed-stead possessing special characteristics; on it the golden image of the deceased should be placed and also fruits and clothes. After honouring a brāhmada couple with many ornaments this should be done; then a bull should be let loose (for the benefit of the deceased) and the gift of a dark brown con should also be made.1202 The Garuḍapurana (Pretakhanda 34, 73–8%) gives a more elaborate description which appears to be almost identical with the</p>

The Bhaviṣya purāna quoted by Hemādri (and from Hemādri by the Nirnaya sindhu p. 596 ) states the mantra to be recited viz &ldquo;just as the bed-stead of Krṣpa is never devoid of Laksmi, the daughter of the ocean, similarly my bed may not be empty in each birth that I may have to undergo,&ldquo;1203 Acceptance of the gift of a sayyā was looked down upon in former times and even now it is only the poor brāhmanas ( that are not generally learned) that accept this gift The Padmapurāpa condemns the accept ance of the gift of sayyā in no measured terms. It says &lsquo;when a brāhmade accepts the gift of a bed-stead, he should have to undergo the ceremony of upanayana again. In the Veda as well as in the Purāja (the gift of ) a bed-stead is everywhere condemned and all those who accept the gift go to hell.&rsquo; 1204</p>
<p>Certain other matters connected with śrāddhas may be briefly touched upon. In very ancient times twelve kinds of sons were recognized out of whom the ksetraja, 1205 the putrika putra and dattaka were most important All these were the Bons of two fathers. The question mooted was: to whom were they to offer pindas? The Madanapārijāta (pp 607-608) quotes a passage from the Hārīta-dharmasūtra 1206 and explains it. Harita says, &lsquo;seed does not grow without a field Since it is seen that both are necessary the child born is the child of both. Out of the two (fathers) tha procreator is to be first invoked</p>

The son of the son of two fathers ) may repeat two names as to the 2nd pinda (i. e. the pinda for paterpal grand-father); the grand-son (of the son of two fathers ) may do the same as to the third pinda (viz, the pioda for paternal great-grandfather ),&rsquo; Manu IV, 140 and Gobhila-smrti II. 105 say about the putrikāputra 1207 that he presents the first pioda to his mother (as she was appointed as a son), the 2nd to her father and the third to his father&rsquo;s father. This appears to be one order in which pindas are to be offered by the putrikāputra, while Manu IX, 132 sets out another method since it says that a putrikāputra inherits the entire wealth of his own father if he is sonless and he gives two pindas (i. e. performs two śrāddhas) for his own father and for his maternal grandfather. The Sān, Śr. S. provides 1208 that if there be two fathers, the son should recite the names of both (bījin and ksefrin) with reference to the same pinda. Even Yāj. says &ldquo;The son procreated according to the rules of niyoga by &amp; sonless man on the wife of another inherits the wealth of both and offers pinda to both. 7209 The Mit, adds that if a person appointed to procreate a son on another&rsquo;s wife has a son, then the son so begotten becomes the son of the ksetrin alone and not of the bijin. As the kshtraja and putrikā putra have beconie obsolete for several centuries the subject has only an academic interest now, But the daltaka is still in · vogue and a few words must be said here about the persons to whom the dattaka offers pindas.

He must drive away the bull together with the young cows in the north-eastern direction and give &amp; pair of garments, gold and a vessel of bell metal to the hotr (officiating priest). The blacksmith should be given wages as desired by him and food seasoned with a good deal of clarified butter should be served to three) brāhmanas (at least). That 1219 pool at which a bull let loose (in honour of a deceased person by his son or the like) drinks water serves (reaches) the manes, Wherever a bull (let loose) exulting in his strength scratches (cr digs up) the earth, that earth becoming abundant food and water waits upon the manes.&rdquo; 1220 In the Anuśāsanaparva the pitrs are represented as saying that by letting loose a dark coloured bull, by offering water mixed with sesame and by lighting lamps in the rains a man becomes free from the debt he oves to the pitrs (chap. 125. 73–74).</p>
<p>In the Garuḍapurāpa it is stated that the deceased person for whom a bull is not let loose on the 11th day after death permanently remains a preta, even if hundreds of śrāddhas are offered for him, The same Purāda further provides that if a bull be not available on the 11th day, then the effigy of a bull made of darbhas and flour or clay should be symbolically let loose,1221 In the Bhaviṣyapurāna the 12th day after death is prescribed for the letting loose of a bull (N.S. III. p. 505), The Nirnayasindhu says that the making of an effigy of a bull with clay, darbhas and flour is without authority. Even at present people let loose a bull but owing to the rise in the prices of bulls this is becoming less frequent, Several medieval digests such as the Pitrdayitā (pū, 84, 94), Sraddhaviveka of Rudradhara (pp. 69-77), Nirnayasindhu (IIL pp. 595-596 ), Suddhiprakasa</p>

<p>pp. 225-230, Antyegtipaddbati of Nārāyapabhatta present a far more elaborate description, but from considerations of space thoy are passed over here. It is provided in these and other digosts that such a bull should not be seized by anyone nor made to draw a vehicle and the cow Or Cows let loose along with him should not be milked nor confined in a cow-pen. A bull is not lot loose for a deceased woman, but a cow may be donated together with its calf without being branded and after being decked with sandal-wood paste,1nzia</p>
<p>What is the idea underlying the letting loose of a bull after the death of a person? If a conjecture may be hazarded, it appears to have been thought that if a bull were freed from toil ( that is the lot of most bulls) and placed in the midst of pleasant surroundings, that act of the relatives of the deceased may in a vicarious manner conduce to the bappiness of the departed spirit in the other world,</p>
<p>Ono remarkable matter about śrāddhas is yet to be montioned. The Baud, grhyaśesasūtra TII, 19, the Lingapurana (JI 45, 8-90, some of which are quoted by Śr. Pr. pp 363-364), the Kalpataru (on śrāddha pp. 277-279), Hemādri (Sr. pp.1704-1717), the Srāddhaprakasa (pp. 361-371) and a few other digests describe the procedure of Jivat-frāddha or Jiva-śrāddba, which a man was allowed to perform for the benefit of his own soul, while he was himself alive. Baudhāyana&rsquo;s being probably the most ancient extant description it is briefly set out bore &ldquo;A man who desires his own highest happiness should fast on the 13th tithi of the dark half and bring together materials on the same day, which are required in the funeral rites of deceased persons, vix six garments, a golden needle, a goad, a moose made of (cotton ) threads, a ragged garment, a stalk of palasa leaves, a chair of udumbara wood, jars and other materials also On the next day he bathes; after standing in the midst of water he comes out and makes (the brāhmanas) pronounce this is an auspicious day, may there be happiness and prosperity (for you)'; he makes a gift of garments, &amp; ring and daksinā and facing the south eats rice boiled in milk and mixed with ghee. 1221 a.

<p>He kindles the fire according to the general 1222 procedure laid down for homa, spreads round it darbhas, cooks food on the fire and offers from the cooked food four oblations of food into the fire; the first is made after first reciting the Puronuvākyā 12220 (invitatory prayer) &lsquo;catvāri śrogā&rsquo; (&lsquo;Agni has four horns,&rsquo; Rg. IV. 58. 3, Tai, Ā X, 10.2) and offers the oblation with the Yājyā (offering prayer) &lsquo;tridhā hitam&rsquo; (placed in three plates, Rg. IV, 58, 4) The Puronuvākya and Yājyā of the 2nd oblation of rice are &lsquo;tatsayitur parenyam&rsquo; (Rg, III, 62, 10, Tai, S, I, 564) and &lsquo;yojayitri sūnrtānām&rsquo;. Of the third oblation the Puronuvākyā and Yājyā are respectively &lsquo;ye catvārah&rsquo; (Tai. S V.7, 2. 3) and &lsquo;Dve sruti&rsquo;(Rg, X. 88. 15, Tai Br. I. 4. 2. 3 ); the Puronuvākya and Yājyā of the 4th oblation are respectively &lsquo;agne naya&rsquo; (Rg I. 189 1, Tai, S. 1 114. 3) and &lsquo;yā tiraścī&rsquo; (Br, Up. VI. 3 1). 1223. Then he offers oblations of clarified butter with the Purusasūkta of 18 verses (Vaj. S. 31. 1-18, Tai, À, III, 12) and 1008, 108 or 28 oblations of clarified butter with the Gayatri verse. Then he goes to a spot where four roads meet, makes a gift of the needle, goad, ragged garment, the rope to a short-statured brāhmana who has a dark skin and having made him repeat the words &lsquo;May the servants of Yama be gratified&rsquo; he places the jars on grains of rice. Having wound round the jars that are full of water threads he prepares an effigy of a human being, three threads for the head, three for the mouth, 21 for the neck, 4 for the body, two on each arm, one for the male organ, five for each of the feet with the words &ldquo;May the revered Yama be pleased.&rsquo; Then making ready the chair, washing it with pancagavya, he makes the effigy of a human being on black antelope skin with palaśa stalks, he establishes the prānas in the effigy made on the jar and placing his body on the body made with stalks he should sleep. When he rises,</p>

<p>[Vol. he should himself bathe his body with (the water in) the jars with verses of Purusasūkta and with paroagavya and pure water and eat in the evening food mixed with sesamum grains togethor with clarified butter. He should give dinner to brābmanas for the gratification of the servants of Yama. On the 4th day ha burns (the effigy) with mantras. He should offer water and pinda with the words &lsquo;pinda to me of such and such a gotra for benefit in the next world, svadhā namah.&rsquo; With these words ho should bring to a close the ride. He should observe impurity for ten days for himself, but his agnates have not to observe impurity for him. On the 11th day he porforms ekoddista, They also cite the following verse &lsquo;one who is in distress, a woman and a śūdra having burnt one&rsquo;s body (ie effigy) with mantras should perform all rites on that very day. This is the revela tion. In the oase of women the rite is performed silently or with (?) Vedic mantras. In this way he should perform his own śrāddha every month for a year and at the end of each year up to twelve years. And then he should stop. When he is not able to do all these (himself) his son and the like may perform them. They also reoite the following verae; Although heirs may be alive one may perform one&rsquo;s śraddha while alive, having quickly set about doing everything according to the rules, except Sapindana. One should not make dolay as to the timo specified above, since life is evanescent,&rdquo;</p>
<p>It may be noted that the Baud. grhyaśesasūtra III, 22 contains a very brief procedure of the same rite, but therein two verses of Kanya and one of Viṣṇu are quoted. It appoars that this is a later addition. The text of Baud. grhyasosasūtra MI, 19 is quoted by Sr. Pr, pp. 361-363. But the Sraddha prakāśa also quotes a long passage from the Lingaporāda and explains it (pp. 363-368). The procedure in the Lingapurāṇa, however, materially differs from that of Baudhāyana. It is passed over here from considerations of space. Tho Sriddha mayūkha also gives an elaborate description. Somo of its provisions are stated here. In Jiyat-śrāddha tho word prola should nowhere be used. An effigy of the person is made with fifty kuśas and is to be burnt by another with the mantra *kravyādam-agnim (Rg. X. 16, 9). The person has to kindla fire on the banks of a river with his face to the south with his grhya fire or ordinary fire and has to dig up &amp; pit and mako &amp; prayer to the earth as in the case of an actual death.</p>

<p>Śrāddhi to himself by one living</p>
<p>It contains a &lsquo;far more elaborate procedura: than that of Baudhāgana and is in prose. It contains many of the provisions of Baudhāyana. Further details are passed over here. - -</p>
<p>The provision of a śrāddha for a living person offered by himself is a perversion of the ancient idea of śrāddha. The basic and fundamental conception of a śrāddha was to gratify the spirits of deceased ancestors. People had gone crazy with the idea of srāddhas and invented this new mode to satisfy. that craze. I have known persons that performed Jiyat-śrāddha, though they had sons, younger brothers and nephews who would have certainly performed śrāddhas for them on their death,</p>
<p>It is customary to make a gift of a cow with a calf to a brāhmada, praferably &amp; kapilā cow, on the 2nd day after the period of āśauca Often times this is the only cow given, and the Cow called Vaitatani referred to above (p. 183, note 427) is rarely donated in the midst of the sorrow and turmoil immediately on the death of a dear and near relative. A declaration is first made that a gift of a cow will be made and then water is poured on the hand of a brābmana. Then holding kuśas in his hand the donor makes a gift of the cow with a formula noted below 1224, The dones replies with the words &lsquo;om svasti&rsquo; (Yes, inay it be well!). Then daksinā (in gold or silver coins ) is given and the brahmada says &lsquo;om svasti&rsquo;, holds the tail of the cow and repeats a Kāmastuti (eulogy of Kāma) 1225 according to the recension of the Veda he has studied. The Anuśāsana. parva (57. 28–29 ) eulogises the gift of a kapilā cow with the calf, given with a milking pail of bell-metal, whose horn tips are decked with gold, by stating that such a gift not only saves the donor in the other world but also bis sons, grandsons and family for seven generations. The Anuśāsanaparya (77.10 ff) sets out a legend why the kapilā cow is the best of all cows.</p>
<p>The Purāṇas and digesta devote a good deal of space to śrāddhas at tirthas and at Gayā, Vide Atri 55-58, Vāyupurāna 83. 16-42, Hemādri (on Śr.) pp. 1568 ff and 1575 ff. This sub ject will be briefly dealt with in the section on tirthaṣ. ,,,</p>

<p>[Vol. Much is said on the question whether sraddhas should be performed in the intercalary month. The intercalary month is called by various names, vir, Malimluca (Kathaka Sam. 38. 14),1226 Samsarpa or Amhasaspati (Vajs.1.30 and 22.31), Mals māsa, Adhimāsa. An intercalary month is known even to the Rg veda (Rs. I.25.8). The vendor of soma and the thirteenth month are condemned as papa (sinful) in the Aitareya Brahmanasam. The Puranas tried to bolster up the intercalary month by calling it Parusottama-masa (1. e. the month of Viṣṇu) but the origina] stigma attaching to the 13th month seczas to have persisted. The general rule about an intercalary month is stated by the Grhyaparisista.1228 &ldquo;the month called Malimluca is pottuted and springs from sin; it is condemned for all acts; it should be discarded in all rites in honour of gods and pitrs. But exceptions to this sweeping prohibition have been recognized. Harita provides 1229 that all sraddhas that come after Sapindada are not to be performed in an intercalary month, Vydsa laid down 1230 that such ceremonies as jātakarma, apaaprāśana, the navaśraddhas, sraddha on Maghā and the thirteenth tithi, the sixteen śrāddhas, bath, gifts, jape and śrāddha at the time of the eclipse of the sun or moon these should be performed byen in an intercalary month. The Smrtimuktāpbala concludes (p. 728) that there is no blemish in performing a sraddha in an intercalary month provided it is to be performed before the end of one year from death. It is provided by Burgu 1231 that tha sārnyatsarika sraddha of those who die in an intercalary month</p>

<p>Further discussion about what may be done in Malamāsa and what is prohibited therein will be taken up in the section on Kala. The question as to the day on which a śrāddha is to be performed if the tuthi is spread over two days or if there is a hṣaya of the tithi will also be discussed in that section,</p>
<p>Some of the works on srāddha such as the Pfthyl-candro daya deal with what is called &lsquo;saoghāta-śrāddha.&rsquo; 1232 When on the same day several persons die, but not at the same time, then the śrāddhas for them should be performed, as said by Rsyaśrnga, in the order in which they died. But if five or six persons die at the same time on the same day (as when a vessel sinks in the sea or a market is burnt down all at once ), then the order in which śrāddhas are to be performed is determined by the nearness of relationship to the perforiner of śrāddha in the case of each. For example, if a person&rsquo;s wife, son, brother and paternal uncle meet death at the same time, then the order should be this that the śrāddha of the wife is performed first, then of the son, then of the brother and then of the upole. If the parents die at the same time by accident, then the father&rsquo;s cremation or other rites should be first performed and then of the mother.</p>
<p>Provision is made if the performance of a śrāddha is rendered impossible by some obstacle, Rsyasrnga provides 1233</p>

<p>I Vol. Sif impurity (on death) interrenes Then a śrāddha is to be offered to the piers, srāddha should be offered at the end of the period of impurity. If an obstacle arises at the time when an ekoddista is to be performed, the śrāddha should be performed in another month on the sane tithi. This last refers to a monthly śrāddha. If any of the sixteen śrāddhas fails owing to an obstacle it should be performed on the amārasyā or better still on the 11th day of the dark half. If there is an obstacle oning to impurity on death in the performance of a montbiṣ śrāddha or searis śrāddha it should be performed at the end of the impurity or on amārāstā. 134 The Padmapurāda (Palalakbanda 101, 68-70) Provides similar rules. obstacle is the performer&rsquo;s illness or his inability to collect</p>

<p>It may be - noted that while great emphasis Tas laid on inriting a very learned brābmapa at a śrāddha, that object was often frustrated in practice by the provisions made in certain smrtis that one izs should not partake of śrāddha food for three years after sapindana (which is often one year after death) and that by dining at a śrāddba in the first year one eats the bones and narror of the deceased, in the second year his flesh, in the third Fear his blood and stāddha in the 4th year is (somerhat) pare.

<p>placed before brāhmanas was that one, though entitled to accept gifts on account of his vedic learning and tapas, should not accept gifts, if he desires to secure the highest worla (Yā).

Manu IV. 85-86 (= Padma V.19. 236-237) say that acceptance of a gift from the king is terrible (in its consequences) and Padma wards that gift appears sweet like honey but is like poison (i e, deadly in its effects). This reasoning applied with greater force to officiating and dining at a śrāddha, where not only gifts are to be received, but also sumptuous food that will please the palate</p>

<p>• It has been seen above how the most anciant&rsquo; literary monument, viz the Rgveda, shows that the funeral rites per formed immediately after death were prompted by affectionate concern for the departed spirit mingled with some element of fear, that the object of those rites was to provide sustenance to the departed spirit and to endow it with an intermediate body before it became one of the pitrs. It has also been found that in the most ancient times of which we have literary evidence, there were rites for the worship of ancestors, being the Pinda pitryajña performed every month on amāvāsyā, the Mahāpitr yajña performed in the Sākamedha and the Astakā śrāddhas, Gradually the rites for deceased ancestors became more and more frequent, all-inclusive and elaborate, so that ultimately an exaggerated importance came to be attached to the cult of śrāddhas over which there was an enormous expenditure of time, effort and wealth. The question now arises what Indians of the 20th century should do about śrāddhas. One finds that in these days when many brāhmapas even do not engage in any of the five daily obligatory yajñas (the pañca-yajñas), they are so licitous to offer śrāddha at least once a year to their ancestors. The following may be therefore suggested as a via media for all kinds of people. Those who have faith in the daty of performing śrāddhas and their efficacy for the benefit of</p>

<p>the dead may perform them on a small scale, bearing in mind the emphatic admonition of Manu (NI, 125-126 ), the Kūrmapurāna II. 22, 27, Padmapurāna V, 9. 98 1237 that one should desist from extravagance in the matter of śrāddhas, particularly in the number of brāhmanas to be invited. Those whose faith is shaken or shattered by the onrush of modern ideas and English education or firm belief in the doctrines of Jourma and punarjanna should also remember one thing. The main underlying conception of śrāddha is certainly admirable, viz, a tender and affectionate regard for one&rsquo;s near and dear relatives. It is a good practice to set apart at least one day in a year for the remembrance of one&rsquo;s near and dear relatives that are no more, to invite relatives, friends, and learned people to a dinner in memory of the dead and to bestow monetary gifts on poor but learned persons of oharacter and devoted to the practice of plain living and high thinking, This will be in keeping with our past traditions and will also give a new orientation to and infuse new life into practices and usages that have become lifeless and meaningless to many people. From very ancient times one of the fundamental con ceptions of our faith has been the idea of three debts owed to sages, gods and pitrs. The debt owed to the ancestors is paid off by the procreation of a son who would offer pindas to his (and therefore also to his father&rsquo;s) ancestors, This is a grand conception, Nothing can be more sublime than the formula which one has to repeat at the time of offering pindas and water (with sesame) at Gayā &lsquo;may those of my ancestors that are in the form of pretas be all satiated by means of the (balls made) of barley flour mixed with sesame and may everything, whether moving or immoveable from Brahmā up to blades of</p>
