  <p>ŚRĀDDHA</p>
<p>This subject is of great practical importance from several points of view.</p>
<p>The Brahmapurâna defines śrāddha as follows: &lsquo;whatever is given with faith to brāhmaṇas intending it to be for the (benefit of) pitrs at a proper time, in a proper place, to deserv ing persons and in accordance with the prescribed procedure is called sraddha.751. The Mit. on Yaj. I. 217 definessraddha as &lsquo;abandonment with faith of an article of food or some sub stitute thereof, intending it for (the benefit of) the departed&rsquo;. The Kalpataru on srāddha defined it as &rsquo;the giving up of sacri. ficial material intending it for pitys and its acceptance by brāhmanas&rsquo;. The Srāddhaviveka of Rudradhara and the Śrād dhaprakāśa define śrāddha in the same way as the Mit, but in a more involved manner. Yaj. I. 268 (= Agnipurana 163. 40-41) states that the pitrs viz. Vasus, Rudras and Adityas that are the deities of śrāddha, being gratified by śrāddha, give gratification to the ancestors of human beings. This verse and Manu III. 284 make it clear that the three ancestors of a man,</p>

<p>Definition of śrāddha</p>
<p>viz, the father, paternal grand-father and the paternal great grand-father are respectively to be identified with the three orders of superintending pit; deities, viz. Vasus, Rudras and Adityas, when performing śrāddha. According to some,752 śräddha denotes three things, viz. homa, the offering of pinda (ball of cooked food) and gratification of brāhmaṇas invited to a dinner; the application of this word to any one of these three can only be in a secondary sense.</p>
<p>A firm believer in the doctrine of karma, punarjanma (re incarnation) and karma-vipāka (explained above) may find it difficult to reconcile that doctrine with the belief that by offer ing balls of rice to his three deceased paternal ancestors a man brings gratification to the souls of the latter. According to the doctrine of punarjanma (as very clearly and succinctly put in Br. Up. IV. 4.4 and Bhagavad-gitā 2.22) 753 the spirit leaving one body enters into another and a new one. But the doctrine of offering balls of rice to three ancestors requires that the spirits of the three ancestors even after the lapse of 50 or 100 years are still capable of enjoying in an ethereal body the flavour or essence of the rice balls wafted by the wind. Further, Yāj. I. 269 (which is the same as Mārk. 29. 38, Matsya-purāņa 19. 11-12, Agnipurāna 163. 41-42) provides that the grand fathers (i. e. pitrs) being themselves gratified (by the offerings of food in srāddha) bestow on men (their descendants ) long life, progeny, wealth, learning, heaven, mokşa (final beatitude), all happiness and kingdom. In the Matsya-purāņa (chap. 19, verse 2) a question is asked by the sages how food which a brāhmana (invited at a śrāddha) eats or which is offered into fire is enjoyed by departed spirits that might have assumed (after death) good or evil forms of bodies. The answer given ( verses 3-9) is that fathers, grand-fathers and great-grand fathers are identified with Vasus, Rudras and Adityas respectively according to Vedic passages, that the name and gotra (mentioned at the time of śräddha), the mantras uttered and faith carry to the pitys the offerings made, that if one&rsquo;s</p>

<p>father has become a god (by his good deeds) the food offered in grăddha becomes nectar and follows him in his state of godhood, if he has become a daitya (an asura) then (the food) reaches him in the form of various enjoyments, if he has become a beast then it becomes grass for him and if he has become a snake the śrāddha food waits on him as wind (serpents are supposed to subsist on wind) and so on. Verses 5-9 of the Matsya, chap. 19 are quoted as from Märkandeyapurāna by the Sräddha kalpalata p. 5. Visvarāpa 754 on Yaj. I. 265 (p. 171 of Tri, ed.) also raises the same objection and gives several replies. One is that this is a matter entirely based on śāstra and so when sāstra says that pitys are gratified and the performer gets desired objects no objection should be raised. Another reply is that the gods Vagus and others that have access everywhere have the power to gratify pitrs wherever they may be situated.

He asks: why is sraddha useless? Is it because there is no prescriptive text laying down an obligation</p>

<p>Does śrāddha serve no purpose</p>

<p>to perform it or is it because sraddha produces no consequences or is it that it is not proved that pitrs and the rest are gratified by śrāddha? To the first he replies that there are such passages as &rsquo;therefore a wise man must perform şrāddha with all his efforts that lay down the obligation; nor is the 2nd objection proper, since Yāj. I. 269 does declare the rewards (of śrāddha ) viz, long life &amp;c. Nor is the third alternative acceptable. In the śrāddha rites it is not that the mere ancestors named Deva datta and the like are the recipients and that they are denoted by the words pitr, pitämaha and prapitāmaha, but that those words denote them as accompanied by the superintending deities viz. Vasus, Rudras and Adityas. Just as by the words Deva datta and the like what is denoted is not merely the bodies ( so named) nor merely the souls, but what is denoted by the words is individual souls as particularised by the bodies; in the same way the words pit? and the like denote Devadatta and others together with the superintending deities (viz. Vasus, Rudras and Adityas). Therefore, the superintending deities viz, the Vasus and the rest, being gratified by the food and drink offered by the sons and the rest, gratify those also viz. Davadatta and the rest and endow the performers (of śrāddha ) with such rewards as male progeny and the rest. Just as a. woman expecting to be a mother becomes gratified by partaking of the food and drink for which she has a longing in pregnancy and which is given to her by another person for the sustenance of the child in the womb, she satiates also the child in her womb and endows those that offer her the food and drink for which she has longings by bestowing on them some reward in return. Thus the pitss denoted by the words father, grand father and great-grand-father are the deities Vasus, Rudras and Adityas, and not merely (human beings called ) Devadatta and the rest. Hence these deities of śrāddha become the recipients (of gifts) in the śrāddha rite, are gratified by the śrāddha and gratify in their turn the ancestors of human beings.

<p>Mārkandeyapurāpa many of which are found in chap. 28 ( verses 3 ff) of the printed text. It is said 757 that just as a calf finds its own mother from among many cows that are scattered about, so the mantras repeated in srāddha carry the food to the pitřs.</p>
<p>The explanation offered by the Śrāddha-kalpalatā relying on passages of the Mārkandeyapurāna is not satisfactory and is rather far-fetched. The Mārkandeya and the Matsya appear to agree with the doctrine of Vedānta that immediately on leaving one body the soul has recourse to another body, either as a god or a man or a beast or a snake &amp;c. The hypothesis pro pounded is that the food and drink offered in šrāddhas becomes transformed into various substances for the use of the ancestors (Matsya 141. 74–75). But the great difficulty in accepting this explanation is that the ancestors might die at different places, while śrāddha may very often be performed at one place far away from those places. It is difficult to believe that the grass growing in one place where the ancestor has been transformed into a beast as a result of his evil actions is the same that might have been produced from the substances offered in śräddha at a place hundreds of miles away. Further, if one or all the three ancestors have been transformed into beasts or the like how can they recognize their offspring and bestow on them long life, wealth &amp;c? If the Vasus, Rudras and Adityas bestow these, it is better to say so directly and affirm that pitrs cannot bestow</p>

<p>any thing on their progeny. It appears very probable that the worship of ancestors by means of śrāddhas was a very ancient institution and that the doctrines of punarjanma and karmavipāka were comparatively later ones and that Hinduism being all-embracing retained the institution of śrāddhas while adopting also the doctrine of metempsychosis. The institution of srāddha is from one point of view an excellent one. It provides an occasion for remembrance of one&rsquo;s ancestors and relatives that were dear and near when living. The Aryasamāja objects to the institution of sraddha and interprets pitrs in the Rgveda as meaning living men in the Vānapragtha stage. It may be noted that the texts support both views. The Šat. Br. expressly says that food is offered to the father of the sacrificer in the words &rsquo;this is for thee.&rsquo; Vişnu Dh. S. 75. 4 &ldquo;He whose father is dead may put down a pinda for his father &amp;c. On the other hand Manu III, 284 states that fathers are spoken of as Vasus, grandfathers as Rudras &amp;c. and Yāj. I. 269 provides that Vasus, Rudras and Adityas are the pitrs and the devatās of śrāddha. These latter are to be explained as con taining an injunction to contemplate upon the pitrs as Vasus, Rudras &amp;c.</p>
<p>As stated below (p. 347) with regard to the Rgvedic passages, it was on account of the supposed power of pitrs to benefit or harm the living that the cult of the dead became a prominent feature in primitive societies. Offerings and ceremonies which may have in most ancient times been prompted in part at least by the desire to placate the ancestors are continued as tokens of pure affection and remembrance. Various beliefs about pitrs are mentioned 758 in post-Vedic Literature. The Baud. Dh, S. II. 8. 14 summarizes a brāhmana text stating that pitrs move about in the form of birds. The Aušanasa-smrti and Devala quoted by the Kalpataru say the same thing. In the Vāyu purāna 759 it is stated that at the time of śräddha the ancestors</p>

<p>enter the brāhmanas (invited) after assuming an aerial form and that when the best of brāhmaṇas are honoured with clothes, foods, gifts, eatables, liquids, cows, horses and villages, pitrs become pleased. Manu III. 189 and the Aušanasa-smrti also support this notion that pitrs enter the invited brāhmaṇas. The Matsyapurana (18. 5-7 ) enjoins: pindas should be offered to the departed for twelve days after death, since they serve hin as food on his journey and give him great satisfaction. Therefore, the soul leaving the dead body is not taken to the abode of the departed for twelve days after death); the departed spirit hovers near his house, his sons, his wife for twelve days. Therefore for ten days after death milk (and water) should be placed (hung up) in space for ten nights for reducing all torments (or troubles of the departed) and for the removal of the fatigue of the journey (that the departed spirit has to make ). The Vişnudharmasūtra 760 (20.34-36 ) provides “the departed spirit enjoys in the world of pitrs the food offered in srāddha with the utterance of the word &lsquo;svadhā&rsquo;; whether the departed is in the state of a god or in the place of torments (Hell) or in the form of a lower animal or a human being, the śräddha food offered by his relatives reaches him; when śrāddha is performed, the performer and the departed soul both certainly secure vigour (or prosperity ).”</p>
<p>The Brahmapurāņa 761 states that śrāddha is to be treated of under five heads, viz. how, where, when, by whom and with what materials. But before proceeding to deal with these five heads, it is necessary to dilate upon the underlying ideas and significance of the word &lsquo;pitarah&rsquo; from the most ancient times of which we have literary records.</p>
<p>The word &lsquo;pitr&rsquo; means &lsquo;father&rsquo;, but the word &lsquo;pitarah&rsquo; is used in two senses, viz. (1) a man&rsquo;s three immediate deceased ancestors, (2) the early or ancient ancestors of the human race that were supposed to inhabit a separate world (loka) by them</p>

<p>Meaning of &lsquo;Pitarah</p>
<p>selves. 762 For this second meaning, vide Rg. X. 14. 2 and 7, X 15.2 (translated above pp. 191-92, 194) and Rg. IX.97.39.762a &ldquo;That Soma which becomes stronger and stronger and makes others strong, that is strained through a strainer, that flows in a stream, protected us by means of the luminary (the Sun)&ndash;that Soma with whose help our ancestors knowing the place where the cows were kept concealed) and the higher regions, harassed the mountain for the sake of recovering) the cows.&rsquo; In Rg. X. 15.1 the pitrs are said to be of three grades, lower, middling or higher. They are also said to be earlier and later ones (Rg. X. 15.2). They are all known to Agni, though all pitrs are not known to their descendants (Rg. X. 15. 13). The pitrs are divided into several groups such as Angirasas, Vairūpas, Atharvans, Bhrgus, Navagvas and Daśagvas (Rg. X. 14,5-6), the Angirasas being particularly associated with Yama who is invoked to come to the sacrifice along with the Angirasas (Rg. X. 14. 3-5). In Rg. I. 763 62. 2 it is said:</p>
<p>through whose (Indra&rsquo;s) help our ancient ancestors (pitarah), the Angirasas, who sang his praises and who knew the place, found out the cows.&rsquo; The pitrs called Angiras were, it appears, again subdivided into two classes viz. Navagva and Daśagya 764 both of which words occur in Rg. 1. 62 4, V. 39. 12 and X. 62. 6. In several passages the ancient fathers are identified with the seven sages 765 as in Rg. IV. 42.8 and VI. 22.2 and sometimes the Navagvas and Daśagvas also are said to be the geven sages (Rg. I. 62.4). Angirasas are said to be the song of Agni (Rg. X. 62, 5) and also of Heaven (Rg. IV. 2. 15). The pitrs are often said to regale themselves in the company of gods,</p>

<li>This idea is at least Indo-Iranian, if not Indo-European, The ancient Parsi scriptures speak of Fravashis that were originally the same as pitrs of ancient Hindu works or the Manes among the ancient Romans. They were the everlasting and deified souls of the dead. Gradually the mean ing of Fravashi was extended and even Gods and objects like the Earth and the sky were supposed to have each a Fravashi. Vide S. B. E. vol. 4 p. 262 for the Fravashis of the holy Yama and for the different classes of Fravashis; also S. B. E. vol. 23 pp. 180, 184, 230.</li>

<p>particularly of Yama (Rg. VII. 76, 4, X, 14, 10, X, 15, 8-10). 766 The mitrs are said to be fond of Soma drink (Rg. X. 15. 1 and 5, IX. 97. 39), they lie down on kusa grass (Rg. X. 15.5), they come with Agni and Indra to partake of the offerings (Rg. X. 15. 10 and X. 16.12) and Agni is also said to carry the offerings to the pitrs (Rg. X. 15.12). Fire is supposed to take the spirit of a cremated person to the pitys (Rg. X. 16. 1-2, 5=A, V. 18. 2. 10; Rg. X, 17, 3). In later works also (e. g. in Mārk, chap. 45), Brahmā is supposed to have created in the beginning four classes viz. gods, asuras, pitrs and human beings. Vide also Brahmāndapurāņa, Prakriyā, chap. 8, and upodghāta chap. 9. 35 (ityete pitaro devā devāśca pitaraḥ punaḥ anyonyapitaro hyete).</p>
<p>It was supposed that the departed spirit, after the cremation of the body, was endowed with an ethereal body and became associated with Yama, the gatherer of departed men (Rg. X. 14.1 and 8, X. 15. 14, X. 16.5), and with pitrs. The departed spirit went to the world of the pitȚs and Agni was implored to take the spirit to the world of the departed whose deeds were good and to the stride of Visņu (Rg. X. 14. 9, X. 15.3, X. 16. 4).</p>
<p>Although Yama is said to dwell in heaven (divi) in Rg. X. 64.3, he is really a god of the middle region, as the Nirukta states, 767 The Atharvaveda states: 768 let us worship with obeisance the fathers and grandfathers of our father, that enter the wide middle regions, that dwell on the earth and in heaven.&rsquo; In Rg. I. 35.6 769 it is said : there are three worlds; two of them (Heaven and earth) are in the lap of Savitr; one (i. e. the middle region) is in the domain of Yama where departed spirits congregate, &lsquo;The great Luminary (the Sun) has risen, a gift of the pit;s&rsquo; (Rg. X. 107. 1). In the Tai. Br. I. 3. 10. 5 770</p>

<p>The World of Pitrs</p>
<p>it is said that the pitrs dwell in the third world from this. This means that after bhūloka and antariksa comes the pitsloka. In the Br. Up. I. 5.16 three worlds of men, pitrs and gods are separately mentioned. In Rg. X. 135. 1-7, Yama is spoken of in somewhat different language. He is in this hymn men tioned as a god by himself and not as the first mortal who made a path (Rg. X. 14. 2) or as the gatherer of men (X. 14.1) or as being in company of the pitrs. In a few other places Yama is no doubt called rājan and praised in the same breath with Varupa (Rg. X. 14,7). But such a position is very rarely mentioned, For the further development of Yama and his assistants as the punishers of men for evil deeds, vide pp. 159-160 above and notes 381-386.</p>
<p>There is another division of pitrs viz. pitaraḥ somavantaḥ,771 pitaraḥ barhi şadah, pitarah agnişvāttāḥ. The latter two are named in Rg. X. 15. 4 and 11 (which occur also in Tai. S. II, 6. 12. 2). The Sat. Br. defines these as follows:-&ldquo;those that performed a soma sacrifice are pitaraḥ somavantah; those that offered cooked oblations (like caru and purodāsa) and secured a world are pitarah barhi sadah; those that did none of these (two actions) and whom fire consumes when burning them are &rsquo; pitarah agnişvāttāḥ;&rsquo; these are the only ones that are pitarah.&rdquo; The Tai.772 Br. has a somewhat similar passage and the Kāthaka Samhita IX. 6. 17 also refers to these three kinds of pitrs. Later writers introduced certain changes in the mean ings of the words for the different classes of pitys and also in creased the number of the classes of pitys. For example, the Nandipurāņa q. by Hemādri states: the pitrs of brāhmaṇas are called &lsquo;agnişvātta&rsquo;, those of ksatriyas &lsquo;barhişadah&rsquo;, those of vaisyas &lsquo;kāvyas&rsquo;, those of südras aukālin&rsquo; and those of mle cchas and untouchables are called &lsquo;vyāma&rsquo;. 773 Even Manu</p>

<p>(III, 193-198) mentions several classes of pitys, connects pitrs called Somapās, Havirbhujaḥ Ājyapās and Sukālins with the four varnas and in III, 199 states that the pitrs of brāh manas are designated as Anagnidagdha, Agnidagdha, Kāvya, Barhişad, Agnişvātta and Saumya. Those verses of Manu appear to summarize different traditions about the several classes of pitys. Vide Matsyapurāņa 141. 4 for the same last four names and 141. 15-18 for their definitions. In Sătātapa smrti (VI. 5–6) twelve groups or divisions of pilys are mentioned viz. pindabhājaḥ (three), lepabhājaḥ (three), Nāndimukhas (three) and Aśrumukhas (three). This is a classification of pitrs from two different standpoints. In Váyu 72,1 and 73.60, Brahmānda (Upodghāta 9.53), Padma V. 9. 2-3, Vişnudharmo ttara I. 138. 2-3 and other Purāṇas the classes of pitrs are said to be seven, three of which are formless (amūrti mat) and four have forms (mūrtimat) and they and their offspring are des cribed in detail. All this is passed over here. The Skanda purāņa (VI. 216. 9-10) speaks of nine groups of pitrs, being Agni şvāttāḥ, Barhişadaḥ, Ājyapāḥ, Somapāḥ, Raşmipāḥ, Upahūtāḥ, those called &lsquo;āyantunah&rsquo;, &lsquo;Srāddhabhujaḥ, Nāndimukhāh. In this list old and new elements are mixed up. The Indian mind often revels in divisions, sub-divisions and classifications with out much basis therefor and this is probably an illustration of that tendency. Manu (III. 201) states that from the sages the pitrs sprang, from the pitrs sprang gods and human beings and from the gods arose the whole world whether moving or immo vable. It is remarkable that here the gods are spoken of as springing from the pitrs. This is really a mere eulogy of pitrs (i. e. it is an arthavāda).</p>

<p>(pañcajanā mama hotram juşadhyam) and other passages, the Ait. Br. (13.7 or 3.31) explains that they are the five classes, viz. Gandharvas with Apsarases, pitrs, devas, sarpas and rākşasas. The Nirukta III. 8 partly follows this explanation and also gives another. In the Atharvaveda X, 6.32 the gods, pitrs and men are mentioned in that order. The ancient Vedic texts and practice make a sharp distinction between the Gods and the Pitrs. The Tai. S. VI. 1.1.1 states: &rsquo;the gods and men divided the quarters, the gods took the east, pitrs the south, men the west and Rudras the north.&rsquo; The general rule is that sacrifices for gods are begun in the forenoon, while the pitr-yajña is performed in the afternoon (San. Br.).775 The Sat. Br. II, 4.2.2 narrates that the pitrs wearing the sacred thread over the right shoulder (and under the left arm) and bending their left knee approached Prajāpati, when Prajāpati said to them &lsquo;you will have food at the end of) each month (on the Amāvāsyā), your svadhā (cordial) will be swiftness of thought and the moon will be your light,&rsquo; while to the gods he had said that sacrifice will be their food and the sun their light. The Tai. Br. 776 I. 3. 10.4 appears to make a distinction between pitrs who are of the nature and position of gods and pitrs that are more or less like human beings.</p>
<p>The Kausika-sūtra (1. 9-23) neatly collects in one place the difference in the procedure of the rites meant for gods and for pitrs. The performer of rites for gods wears the sacred thread on the left shoulder and under the right armpit, while in the case of the rites for pitrs it is worn on the right shoulder and under the left arm; the rite for gods is either begun facing the east or north, while that for the pitss is begun facing the south; the rite for gods is finished in the north-east (or north or east), while that for the pitys is completed in the south-west; an action is done only once for pitrs, while for gods at least thrice or as many times as the texts direct; in going round (perambulating) the right side is turned towards gods and the left one in the case of pitrs; offerings are made to gods with the words &lsquo;svāha&rsquo; and &lsquo;vaşat&rsquo;, while they are made to pitřs with &lsquo;svadhā&rsquo; and</p>

<p>&rsquo;namaskāra&rsquo;; the darbhas employed in rites for Fathers are those that are taken out from the earth with their roots, while for gods darbhas used are cut a little above the roots. The Baud. Sr. II, 2. also mentions some of these in one place. 777 The Rgveda itself (in X. 14,3&rsquo;svāhānye svadhayānye madanti&rsquo;) marks this distinction in the words employed at the offerings to Gods and Pitrs. The Sat. Br. (II. 1,3,4 and II. 1.4.9) speaks of the gods as immortal and of the Fathers as mortal.</p>
<p>Though the gods and pitřs are placed in separate classes, still the pitss partake of some characteristics of the divine. As Rg. X. 15. 8 shows, the pitės drank Soma. In Rg. X.68.11 it is said that the pitȚs adorned the sky with nakşatras (naksatrebhiḥ pitaro dyām-apimśan) and placed darkness in the night and light in the day. The pitrs are said to have found out the light that was secreted and to have produced the Dawn (Rg. VII. 76. 4). Here the pitys are credited with powers possessed by the highest gods. The pitrs are invoked with affection and regard for conferring various boons and their favour is sought in various ways. In Rg. X, 14. 6 the good will (sumati) and favour (saumanasa) of the pitrs are sought. In Rg. X. 15. 1. and 5 the protection of pitrs is sought. They are requested to grant happiness unmixed with trouble (Rg. X. 15. 4.), to bestow wealth on the sacrificer (Rg. X. 15.7 and 11) and on his son. Rg. X. 15.11 and A. V. 18. 3. 14778 seek the bestowal of wealth and heroic sons, A. V. 14. 2.73 says ‘May the pitrs who throng round the bride to see her grant her happiness endowed with progeny.&rsquo; 779 In the Vāj.

It should not be, however, supposed that the element of fear of the pitrs is altogether wanting. 780a For example, Rg. X. 15.6 prays &lsquo;whatever fault we may commit in reference to you through our being (erring) men do not injure us for that.&rsquo; In Rg. III. 55. 2 we read &lsquo;May the gods and the ancient pitrs who know the place (of the cows or the path ) not harm us here.&rsquo; In Rg.X.66. 14 it is said the Vasisthas praising the gods fashioned speech (hymns ) like pitys and like sages.&rsquo; Here pitrs and rșis are separate groups and Vasisthas are compared to both.7805</p>
<p>In many passages of the Vedic Literature the word pitarah is applied to the three immediate deceased male ancestors of a man. &ldquo;Therefore up to three generations they specify (the ancestors) by name; for so many are the ones to whom sacrifice is offered&rsquo; (vide n. 772 above).

Relying on these Vedic passages and on the fact that Manu (III. 221 ) and Visnudharma sūtra (21. 3,75. 4) prescribe the invocation of pitrs after men tioning their gotra and names that the Srāddhaprakāśa (p. 13) concludes that it is really the father and the other ancestors that are the deities of śrāddha and not Vasu, Rudra and Aditya, since these latter have no gotra and that the description of the father and others as Vasu, Rudra and Aditya is meant only for contemplation (on them as identical with Vasus &amp;c.). On a passage of the Brahmapurāņa 782 prescribing that the perfor mer should say to the invited brāhmanas that he would call the pitrs to the rites and that when the brāhmaṇas give per mission to call them he should do so, the Śr. P. (p. 204) remarks that the pitrs here meant are the divine ones viz. Vasus, Rudras and Adityas and also the human ones viz. the performer&rsquo;s father and the rest. The Vāyupurāpa (56. 65-66) Brahmānda and Anu. distinguish between pitrs who are above and pitrs who are laukika, viz. father, grand-father and great-grand-father. Vide also Vāyu 70. 34 for pitrs that are like gods.</p>
<p>In the post-Vedic Literature, particularly in the Purānas, a great deal is said about the origin and classes of pitrs. For example, the Vāyupurāna 56. 18 speaks of three classes of pitrs viz. &lsquo;kävyäh, barhisadah and agnisvāttāḥ&rsquo;, while the same Purāna, chap. 73, Varāha 13. 16 ff, Padma (Srsti 9. 2-4) and Brahmända III. 10.1 speak of the origin of pitrs of seven classes that dwell in heaven, four of which have a form ( mürlimat ) and three of which are without form (amūrta). The Sātātapa-smrti (6. 5-6 ) speaks of 12 pitrs viz. pindabhājah, lepabhājah, nāndimukhāḥ and aśrumukhāḥ. All such descrip tions have to be passed over from considerations of space.</p>

<p>Promulgators of śrāddha rites</p>
<p>349</p>
<p>From the sūtra period ( about 600 B.C.) to the most modern among medieval Dharmaśāstra works the authors wax eloquent over the praises or the importance or benefits of the institution of śrāddhas. One of the earliest works among these, viz. the Ap. Dh. S. gives the following interesting information : 783 “Formerly men and gods lived together in this world. The gods went to heaven owing to sacrifices (i. e, as a reward of sacrifices that they performed), but men remained behind. Those among men who perform sacrifices in the same way as the gods did, dwell in the other world (i. e. heaven) with the gods and Brahman. Then (seeing that men lagged behind) Manu promulgated the rite which is designated by the word &lsquo;śrāddha&rsquo; and which tends to the salvation (or happiness) of mankind. In this rite the Manes (pitaraḥ) are the deities but the brāhmaṇas (that are fed) are in the place of the āhavaniya fire (in which in sacrifices to gods oblations are offered)&rdquo;. On account of this last sūtra Haradatta (com, of Āp. Dh, S.) and others hold that feeding the brāhmaṇas is the princi pal act at a śrāddha. The Brahmāndapurāņa (Upodghātapāda 9. 15. and 10. 99) speaks of Manu as the promulgator of śrāddha rites and Visņupurāņa III. 1. 30, Vāyu 44. 38 and Bhāgavata III. 1, 22 designate Manu as Srāddha-deva, Similarly, in the Säntiparva 345.784 14-21 and the Visnu-dharmottara I.139.14-16 it is stated that the institution of śrāddha was established in the Boar incarnation by Visnu and that Vispu should be regarded as dwelling in the three pindas offered to the father, grand-father and great-grandfather. From this and from the passage of the Ap. Dh. S. cited above we may infer that it was believed even several centuries before Christ that the institution of śrāddhas had a hoary antiquity behind it and that it was as old as Manu, the father of mankind according to the Rgveda (VIII. 63.1, VIII. 30. 3.). It is, however, very remarkable that the word &lsquo;śräddha&rsquo; itself does not occur in any undoubtedly authentic and ancient Vedic passage, though the rite called Piņdapitr yajña 785 (performed on the amāvāsyā of each month by an</p>

<p>[Vol. Ahitāgni), the Mahāpitryajña (performed in the Cāturmāsya called Sākamedha) and the rites called Astakās were known to the early Vedic literature. The word śräddha occurs in the Kathopanişad (1.3.17) &lsquo;whoever proclaims this highly esoteric doctrine in an assembly of brāhmaṇas or at the time of śrāddha tends to secure immortality.&lsquo;786 The other early occurrences of the word śrāddha known to me are confined to the sutra literature. The most reasonable and probable inference to be drawn from these facts is this that only a few rites (mentioned just above) were known as related to the pitss and that there fore no need arose for a generic term in very ancient times to comprehend several rites for the pitrs. But when the number of rites in honour of pitss increased, the generic term &lsquo;śrāddha&rsquo; was hit upon.</p>
<p>A few samples of the panegyrics on śrāddha may be set out here. The Baud. 787 Dh. S. states that rites for the Fathers confer long life, heaven, fame and prosperity. The Harivamsa 788 says &rsquo;the would derives support from śrāddha and Yoga (i. e. Mokşa) springs from it.&rsquo; Sumantu 789 quoted in the Smộticandrikā (śrāddha p. 333 ) states nothing else is declared to be more beneficial than śrāddha.&rsquo; The Visnupurāna (III. 14, 1-4) avers that if a man performs śräddha with faith he thereby propitiates Brahmā, Indra, Rudra and the other gods, sages, birds, men, beasts, creeping animals, hosts of pitrs and whatever else is styled a being and the whole world. Yāj. I. 270 790 promising long life and several other benefits arising from gratifying pitys has already been quoted above (p. 337). Yama has a similar verse. It is said in a passage of the Visnudharmottara 791 quoted by the Srāddhasāra (p,6) and Srāddhaprakāśa (pp. 11-12) that the pinda offered to the</p>

<p>Panegyries of sraddha</p>
<p>great-grandfather is declared to be god Vāsudeva himself, the one to the grandfather is designated Sankarsana, that to the father is known as Pradyumna and the offerer of the pindas is him self in the position of Aniruddha. In Sāntiparva 345. 21 it is stated that Visnu should be looked upon as staying in the three pindas. In the Kūrmapurāņa it is stated on the day of Amāvāsyā the pitrs assuming an aerial form come to the door of their former haunt and mark whether śrāddha is being per formed by men of their family. This they do till sunset. When the sun sets, being oppressed by hunger and thirst, they become full of despair and feel sorrow, breathe heavily for a long time and go away condemning their descendants. The pitrs of him who does not offer srāddha on amāvāsyä, even with water or vegetables, go away after cursing him&rsquo;.</p>
<p>It is necessary to say a few words about the derivation of the word &lsquo;sräddha&rsquo;. That the word is derived from &lsquo;sraddhā&rsquo; is quite clear. In the definition quoted above from the Brahma puräna and the definition 792 given by Marici and Brhaspati the connection of śrāddha with sraddha is emphasized. In śräddha one entertains the firm faith or conviction that what is given up to the brāhmaṇas for the benefit of the departed man or the Fathers will reach him or them in some way. The Skandapurana VI. 218.3 says that śräddha is so called because śraddhā is the root (or main spring) of that rite. This means that there is not only the conviction stated above but that there is a firm belief that a person is under an obligation to offer it. Sraddhā is deified and addressed as a deity in Rg. 793 X. 151. 1-5, the first verse of which is explained in the Nirukta (IX, 31). The word also occurs in Rg. II. 26.3, VII. 32. 14, VIII, 1.31, IX. 113. 4. In some verses the two components of the word</p>
<p>sraddhā&rsquo; (viz. srat&rsquo; and &lsquo;dhā&rsquo;) are separated without any change in the meaning. For example, in Rg. II. 12. 5 (= A. V. 20. 34, 5) it is said &lsquo;Have faith in him; O people! he is Indra&rsquo;. In Rg. X. 147. 1, addressed to Indra, we have I have faith in that high wrath of yours &amp;c.&rsquo; (śratte dadhāmi</p>

I. 103.5. Śrat and sraddhā are both mentioned in the Nighantu (III. 10) as meaning &lsquo;satya&rsquo;. In the Vāj. S. 19.77 we are told that Prajāpati put Sraddhā in truth and aśraddha in falsehood, while in Vāj. S. 19.30, it is said that truth is obtained by sraddhā.</p>
<p>In the post-vedic Literature, Pāṇini explains the forms śrāddhin&rsquo; and &lsquo;śrāddhika&rsquo; in y. 2. 85, in the sense of one who has eaten a śrāddha dinner.&rsquo; The word &lsquo;śrāddha&rsquo; may be derived from sraddhā according to Pän. V.1.109 795. Sraddha is variously defined. In the bhāsya on Yogasūtra I. 20, &lsquo;śraddha&rsquo; is defined as the composure of the mind 796 (or men tal approval). Devala defines sraddhā: &lsquo;confidence (in the efficacy) of religious acts is called sraddhā; one who has no faith has no reason (or motive) for engaging in religious acts: 797. The Srāddhasūtra 798 of Katyāyana prescribes &lsquo;one endowed with śraddhā should offer śräddha even with vege tables (if nothing else is available). Vide Manu III, 275 which emphasizes sraddhā for the gratification of pitrs. The Märkandeyapurāņa (29. 27) emphasizes 799 the relation of śräddha to sraddhā and states that what is offered at śräddhas becomes transformed into that kind of food for the use of the pitrs who require food in the new bodies they might have assu med according to the doctrine of karma and punarjanma and it also remarks that arāddha offered with wealth acquired in an improper or unjust way is a means of gratification to the pitrs that are born as cāņdālas, pukkasas and similar very low grades of people.

<p>It has already been stated above (pp. 349-350) that in very ancient times there were only three rites for departed ancestors, viz. Pinda-pitr-yajña (offered by those who had consecrated the srauta fires) or monthly Śrāddha in the case of those who had not done so (vide e. g. Ašv. Gr. II. 5. 10, Hir. Gr. II. 10. 1, Āp. Gr. VIII. 21. 1, Visnupurāņa III. 14. 3 &amp;c.), the Mahäpitr yajña and the Astakā śrāddhas. The first two have been already described in vol. IL (as said above), but the Astakā śrāddhas have not been described at all so far. Therefore some remarks will be offered here about them. They are of special importance, but the authorities present great variations on almost all points such as the number of days and the months in which they were to be performed, the deities to be worshipped, the offerings to be made and the procedure to be followed.</p>
<p>Gaut. (VIII, 19) mentions &lsquo;Astakā&rsquo; rite as the first among the seven kinds of pākayajñas and as one of the forty samskāras. Astakā appears to have meant the 8th tithi in any month after the Full Moon day (vide Sat. Br. VI. 4. 2.10). The Sat. Br. states 800 &lsquo;On the 8th day (after full moon) he (the performer of agnicayana ) collects the materials for the fire pan, for sacred to Prajāpati is the 8th day (after full moon) and sacred to Prajapati is this rite viz. the firepan.&rsquo; Sabara in his Bhāsya on Jai.801 I.3.cites a verse occurring in the A, V. III, 10. 2 and in the Ap. M. P. II. 20. 27 as a mantra indicative of Astakā. The mantra is &ldquo;May that (Astakā) night be very auspicious for us, whom people welcome like a cow coming towards a person and which is the wife of the Year.&rsquo; In the A. V. IIL 10. 8 the Ekāstakā is said to have the year (Samvatsara ) as husband. The Tai. S. VII. 4. 8. 1. provides 802&rsquo; Men about to take dikşā (consecration) for a Samvatsarasattra should undergo dikşā on the Ekāştakā; what is called Ekāstakā is the wife of the year.&rsquo; Jai. (VI. 5. 32-37) explains that Ekāstakā is the 8th tithi after the Full Moon of Māgha. The Āp. Gr. (quoted by Haradatta</p>

<p>on Gaut. 8. 19) says 803 the same, but adds that on it (the 8th tithi) the moon is in Jyesthā constellation. This means that if the 8th tithi is spread over two days, then that day on which the moon is in Jyesthā would be called Ekāstakā,804 The Hir. Gr. (II, 15.9) also says that Ekāstakā is called the wife of the</p>
<p>year. 805</p>
<p>According to the Āśw. Gs. II, 4. 1 the Astakā days (and rites ) were four, viz. the 8th tithis of the dark halves of the four months of the two seasons of hemanta and śiśira (i. e. of Mārgaśirşa, Pausa, Māgha and Phālguna). Most of the Grhya sütras viz. Mānava Gr. II. 8, Sān. Gr. III. 12.1, Khādira Gr. III. 3.27, Kathaka Gr. 61.1, Kausitaki Gr. III. 15. 1 and Pär, Gr. UIT. 3 say that there are only three Astakā rites viz. on the 8th after the Full Moon day of Mārgaśīrsa (called agrahāyani) i.e. in the dark halves of Mārgasirsa, Pausa (or Taisa) and Māgha. The Gobhila Gr. III, 10.48 mentions that the Astakās are four according to Kautsa and in all flesh is to be offered, but that Gautama, Audgāhamāni and Vārkakhandi prescribe only three and Gobhila follows these latter, The Baud. Gr. II. 11. 1 provides that the three Astakā homas are performed in the months of Taiņa, Māgha and Phālguna. Āśv. Gr. II. 4.2 refers to an option that Astakā rites were performed only on one Astami (and not on three or four). The Baud. Gr. provides that 806 the rite may be compressed into the three days (7th, 8th and 9th ) of the dark half of Māgha or even in one day (i.e. 8th of the dark half of Māgha). The Hir. Gr.

<p>805 The Full Moon night of Māgha is said to be the mouth of the year i. e, the year began on that day in ancient times. The Astakā day after the Full Moon day was the first and most important festival after the Full Moon and it was younger than the beginning of the year. It is probable that because of this it was spoken of as the wife of the year.</p>

<p>describes only one Astakā rite viz. the Ekāstaka in the dark half of Māgha. The Bhāradvāja Gșhya II. 15 also speaks of only Ekāstakā but adds that the 8th of the dark half of Māgha on which the moon is in Jyesthā is called Ekāstakā. According to Hir. Gr. II. 14 and 15 the one Astakā extended over three days viz. 8th, 9th (on which a cow was sacrificed for the pitrs) and 10th (which was the Anvastakā). The Vaikhānasa-smārta sūtra (ed. by Caland) IV. 8 says that Astakā is to be performed on the 8th of the dark half of Māgha and Bhādrapada or on the 7th, 9th or 10th tithi.</p>
<p>There is divergence in the offerings also. The Kāthaka Gș (61.3), Jaimini Gr. 2.3 and Sān. Gr. (III, 12.2 ) provide that on the three different Astakās the offerings are of cooked vegetables, flesh and apūpas (cakes), while the Pār. Gr. III, 3 and Khădira Gr. III. 3. 29-30 put apūpas for the first Astakā (and hence Gobhila Gr. III, 10. 9 designates it apūpāştaka) and boiled vegetables on the last. According to Khādira Gr. III, 4. 1 a cow is sacrificed. According to Āśv. Gr. II. 4.7-10, Gobhila Gr. IV. 1. 18-22, Kausika 138.2, Baud. Gr. II, 11, 51-61, on the 8th day very many options are given, viz, either to sacrifice a cow or a ram or a goat; or to offer some jungle flesh that may be available or flesh mixed with sesame and honey, or flesh of the rhinoceros, deer, buffalo, ram, boar, spotted deer, hare, Rohita deer, pigeons, śārnga and other birds, or an old red goat; fishes or rice cooked in milk so as to form thin gruel, or gifts only of uncooked corn or fruits and roots, or gold may be offered or only grass for cows or oxen or one may burn some thickets in a forest or present jars for holding water to those deeply learned in the Veda or should recite the mantras relating to śrāddhas, saying &rsquo;this is the Astakā I offer,&rsquo; but one should not remain without observing the Astakā day in some such manner as the above 807</p>

<p>applied to a rite in which the pitrs are the deities worshipped, the greatest divergence prevails as to the devatā of the Astakās. The Āśv. Gr. (II. 4.3 and II. 5. 3-5) provides that on the 7th of the dark half the offerings are made to the pitrs and on the 9th also, but Āśv. II, 4. 12 refers to the eight options as regards the deity of the 8th day, viz. Viśve-devāh (all the gods ), Agni, Sürya, Prajāpati, Rātri (night), Naksatras (constellations ), the seasons, the Pitrs, Pašus (cattle). The Gobhila Gr. III. 10.1 starts 808 by saying that Night is the devatā of Astakā, but adds that there are other views about the devatā being Agni, the Pitrs, Prajāpati, Řtus (seasons) or all Gods.</p>
<p>The procedure of Astakā comprises three parts, viz. homa, inviting brāhmaṇas for dinner (up to seeing them go away after dinner) and the rite called Anvastakya or Anvastakā. When the Astakās were deemed to be three or four performed in the several months noted above, all these were gone through at each Aştakā. When the Astakā rite was performed only in one month i. e, after the Full moon in Māgha, the above parts were performed on three days, 7th, 8th and 9th of the dark half. When compressed in one day only, they must have been per formed one after another on the same day.</p>
<p>Many of the Grhyasūtras, such as those of Āśvalāyana, Kausika, Gobhila, Hiranyakeśin and Baudhāyana describe a very elaborate procedure in the case of Astakās. One of the shortest being that contained in Ap. Gr. (VIII. 21 and 22 ) is given here by way of sample 808a. After defining Ekästakā (in VIII, 21. 10) Āp. proceeds: &lsquo;He (the performer of the Astaka rite) should perform subsidiary (or preparatory) rites in the evening of the previous day (i.e, on the 7th of the dark half). He cooks (or bakes) a cake from rice taken up (from a heap) in four cups; according to some teachers the cake is prepared on eight potsherds (like a purodāsa). After the actions up to the</p>

<p>(the Astakā day) the Anvastakā rite. Its procedure is explain ed by the description of the monthly śräddha.</p>
<p>Though Āp. Gr. (II. 5.3) and San. Gr. III, 13. 7 state that the Anvastakya rite follows the procedure of Pipdapitryajña, some Grhyasūtras (such as Khădira III, 5, Gobhila IV. 2-3) give very elaborate descriptions of that rite. The Āśv. Gr. and Visnudharmasūtra 74 follow a middle course. The description in Āśv. Gr. is comparatively brief and it is set out below. It may be noted that some Grhya-sūtras state that the Anvastakya rite is performed on the 9th or 10th of the dark half (e. g. Khădira Gr. III. 5. 1 &rsquo;navamim daśamim vānvastakyam )&rsquo;. Further, it may be stated that though most Grhyasūtras call the rite Anvastakya still it is also called Anvastaka by Pār. Gr. III, 3. 10, Manu IV. 150, Visnudharmasūtra 74.1 and 76. 1. The most notable peculiarity of this rite is that therein female ancestors are invoked and offerings are made to them of which liquor (surā), scum of boiled rice, collyrium, salves and garlands form part. Though some sūtras (like Āớv. Gr. II. 5) declare that the Astakā and Anvaştakya are modelled on the monthly śrāddha or Pindapitşyajña, others (like the Baud. Gr. III, 12. 1. Gobhila Gr. IV, 4., Khădira III, 5. 35) say that the Astakā or Anvastakya is the norm which is followed in the Pindapitryājña and all the śrāddhas. The Kāthaka Gr. (66. 1, 67. 1, 68. 1, 69. 1) avers 816 that the first śrāddha, the other srāddhas (such as sapiņdikarana), Pasuśrāddha (in which the flesh of an animal is offered) and the śrāddha performed every month follow the procedure of Astakā. The Pipda-pitryajña could be offered on amāvāsyā only by one who was āhitāgni (i.e. had kept the sacred vedic fires). It is impossible to believe that everyone became āhitāgni. The case was probably the reverse i. e. only a few became āhitāgnis and the rest had only the grhya fire or many of the rest were without even the grhya fire. It appears possible that all were required to offer śräddha on amāvāsyā on the analogy of pindapitryajña. As the latter became rare, the requirement of offering śrāddha on amăvāsvā. remained and in the sütras and smrtis all the details were mentioned under māsiśrāddha and in the case of the other gräddhas the sutras and smrtis pointed out only what was to be omitted. It is owing to this that the māsiśrāddha came to be called the prakrti and the other śräddhas were called mikro</p>

<p>The Anvaştakya817 is described in the Āøv. Gr. (II. 5. 2-15) as follows:-Having prepared a portion of the same meat,818 having established the fire on a surface sloping towards the south, having fenced it in and made a door on the north side of the enclosed shed, having strewn round the fire three times sacrificial grass with its roots without touching it, turning the left side (of one&rsquo;s body) towards the fire, he should place down the things to be offered, boiled rice, boiled rice mixed with sesamum, rice cooked in milk, meal pap with curds and meal pap with honey. The ceremony should follow the ritual of the Pindapitryajña (vide Āśv. Śr. II. 6). Having sacrificed (part of the foods specified except meal-pap) with honey let him offer portions of those substances to the pitys and to their wives with the addition of liquor and the scum of boiled rice. Some place the portion to be offered into pits, which may be two or six. In those situated to the east he should present the offerings to the pitrs; in those to the west, to the wives. Thereby the cere mony celebrated in the rainy season on the Maghā day in the dark fortnight after the full moon of Prausthapada (i. e. Bhadrapada) has been declared. And thus he should offer (a festival like the Anvastakā ) to the pitrs every month, obsery ing uneven 819 numbers. He should give food at least to nine (brāhmanas) or to any un-even number of brahmanas. (Food should be given) to an even number on auspicious occasions 820</p>

<p>The Anvastakya rite was performed after each of the three or four Astakās and if only one Astaka in Māgha were perform ed, then after the 8th of the dark half.</p>
<p>There are two views about the rite called Māghyāvarsa 821 in Āśv. Gr. II, 5.9. Acc. to Nārāyana, the rite is performed in the dark half of Bhādrapada for three days on 7th, 8th and 9th.822 The other view is that it is a rite like the Astakās but performed on the 13th of the dark half of Bhādrapada, when generally the moon is in the Maghā naksutra. There is doubt about the very name of the rite, as the mss. present various forms (vide Oldenberg&rsquo;s note in S. B. E. vol. 29. p. 103 on Sän, Gr. III. 13. 1). The real name appears to be Māghyāvarsa or Maghāvarşa (meaning &lsquo;a śrāddha in the rainy season when the moon is in the Maghā nakşatra)&rsquo;. The Vişnu Dh, S. 76. 1 823 mentions the following times for offering śrāddha viz, (twelve) Amāvāsyās (in a year), the three Astakās, the three Anvastakās, the 13th of the dark half of Bhādrapada when the moon is in the Maghā asterism, the seasons of śarad and vasanta. In Visnu Dh. S. (78.52-53) also a śrāddha on the 13th of the dark half of Bhādrapada is highly eulogised. Manu III. 273 also states that whatever food mixed with honey is offered on the 13th day in the rainy season when the moon is in Maghā procures endless satisfaction. To the same effect are Vas. XI, 40 (in the rainy season and on Maghā), Yaj. I. 26 and Varāhapurāna,824 In the</p>

<p>Hir. Gr. II, 13. 3-4 (edited by Kirste) the name appears to be Madhyāvarsa 825 and it is provided that meat is obligatory in it, but that if meat cannot be had then vegetables may be offered, In Pār, 826 Gr. (III. 3) the name (as printed) is madhyāvarsa which is said to be a 4th Astakā in which only vegetables are offered. Aparārka (p. 422) also appears to call the rite &lsquo;madhyā Varşa.&rsquo; In the Bhavisyapurāņa 827 (Brahma-parva), chap. 183. 4 also this rite is referred to but it is said that therein meat is to be offered. It appears probable that this ancient rite on the 13th of the dark half of Bhadrapads is a precursor of the Mahālayasrāddha of later times.</p>
<p>If Āśvalāyana&rsquo;s view, viz. that there are four Astakās in Hemanta and Siśira, were followed and if the Māghyāvarsa śrāddha were to be performed on the 8th of the dark half of Bhādrapada as Nārāyana holds, then there would be five Astakās in all.

<p>Considerations of space forbid the comparison of the above procedure from Āp. Gr. and Āśv. Gļ. with the procedure described in the other Grhyasūtras. It should be noted that several of the sūtras often employ the same mantras in the various stages of the rite (ag pointed out above in notes 813-814).</p>
<p>It must be said that the Astakā śrāddhas gradually fell into oblivion and are not performed now.</p>

<p>which the Astakās and other srāddhas were copies (vikrtis ) with suitable modifications, though a few dissident texts reverse the position,</p>
<p>In the Gobhilagphya (IV. 4. 3 ff) another śrāddha called *Anvähārya&rsquo; is prescribed after the Pindapitryajña on the same day. The Sān. Gr. IV. 1. 13 appears also to describe the monthly śrāddha as distinct from the Pindapitryajña. Manu (III.122-23) states: &lsquo;After performing the Pitryajña (i. e, piņdapitryajña) a brāhmaṇa who keeps sacred fires shall offer every month on the amāvāsyā day the funeral sacrifice Piņdānvāhāryaka. 829 The wise call the monthly offering to the Manes Anvāhārya and that must be carefully performed with the approved kinds of flesh mentioned below.&rsquo; From this it appears that one who has consecrated the frauta fires (i.e. an āhitāgni) was to perform the pindapitryajfa in the grauta fires and also perform the same day another sraddha after the pindapitryajña, while those who had not consecrated srauta fires were to perform on amāvāsyä a sraddha in the gphya fire, which was called piņdānvāhār yaka or simply anyāhārya and also were to offer pindapitr yajña in smārta fire (vide Sat. Srauta II. 7. 64 &lsquo;grhyāgnau anāhitāgneh&rsquo;). From inquiries made I learn that nowadays most Agnihotrins (at least in the Deccan) do not perform Pinda pitryajña at all or perform it only once a year and that no one performs the Pindänvāhāryaka śrāddha. It is further to be noted that in smārta yajñas no one now sacrifices an animal but employs instead māşa grain and there are āhitāgnis who do not offer meat in srauta sacrifices also, but only pişta-pasu (an effigy of an animal made of flour).</p>
<p>The literature on śrāddha is enormous in extent.

<p>adequate and thorough treatment of all this vast mass would fill a separate volume, but considerations of space forbid such an attempt here. All that can be attempted here at the most (and that too not in all cases) is to present matters chronologi cally i. e. describe how śrāddha was dealt with in the Samhitās and Brāhmaṇa texts, then in the comparatively older Gphya and Dharma sūtras, then in such early smftis as those of Manu and Yāj., then in some representative Purāpas, then in the early commentaries of Medhātithi, Vijñānesvara and Aparārka, and then in the medieval digests. Even in this way only a skeleton of the ceremonies described in some representative work of each class can be exhibited. Many differences of detail which arose owing to lapse of time, the locality, the sākhā and usages of each writer, his individual inclination and his ability, will have to be passed over altogether. In the days of the Purānas the differences in detail in the several sākhās have been adverted to.829a Apart from the smrtis and passages of the Mahābhārata (such as Anusäsana chap. 87-92) and com mentaries on the Sūtras, on Manu, Yāj. and other smitis, the digests on śrāddha are legion.

While presenting this exhaustive and hetero. geneous material, some generalisations, when called for, will be made here and there. It will be seen later on how several minor matters such as whether food should be offered to gods before śräddha, definitions of words like parivitti, vrsalipati increased the extent of treatises on śrāddha.</p>

<p>We should now turn to the several matters relating to šrāddhas.</p>
<p>First comes the question as to who are entitled to offer sräddha (śrāddhādhikärin). This matter has been already dealt with in the H. of Dh. vol. III. p. 739 ff., and on page 763 and on pp. 256-261 (notes 581-588) above. It would be noticed that some (like the Visnudharmasūtra ) prescribe that whoever takes the wealth of the deceased should offer pindas (i, e. per form śrāddha for him), while others said that whoever was preferable as entitled to offer pindas to the deceased propositus was to take the wealth. A few matters not mentioned there may be added here. In the Santiparva 65, 13-21 it is narrated830 that emperor Māndhātr was told by Indra how Yavanas, Kirātas and similar non-Aryan peoples (that are styled Dasyus in the Epic) are to be made to conduct themselves and it is stated that all dasyus may perform Pitryajñas (in which they should feed men of their own kind and make monetary gifts to them) and offer money to brāhmaṇas also. The Vāyupurāna (83. 112) also speaks of the Mlecchas as persons that offer oblations to Pitrs. The general rule is stated by the Gobhila smrti 831 that the husband should not offer pipda to his wife even if she dies sonless, nor a father to his son nor an elder brother to a younger brother. The moral of the story of Ninii who performed śrāddha for his predeceased son and repented for having done so as it was dharmasankara is the same. Vide Anušāsanaparva 91. Aparārka (p. 538) quotes a verse from Saţtrimsan-mata that a father should not perform the śrāddha of his son nor an elder brother of a younger one. But Brhat parāśara (p. 153) appears to state that even this general rule may have to be set aside sometimes. Baudhāyana and VỊddhaśātātapa (q. by Sm. C, on śräddha p. 337) allow a śrāddha (except sapiņdikarana) to be performed by any one for any</p>

<p>relative through affection, particularly at Gayā. It is emphas ized 832 that he alone deserves to be called putra, who, while the father is alive, obeys his words, and gives plenty of food (to brāhmanas) every year (after his father&rsquo;s death) and who offers pindas (to his ancestors) at Gayā. The general rule laid down was that a child, whose upanayana has not been performed, is like a südra and lacks authority to utter Vedic passages (vide Āp. Dh. S, II, 6. 15. 19, Gaut. II, 4-5, Vas. II. 6, Vişnu Dh. S. 28. 40. Manu II, 172).833 But an exception was recognized by almost all these authorities that a son, though his upanayana may not have been performed, can repeat the Vedic mantras required in funeral rites. Medhatithi on Manu II, 172 explains that a minor son, even though not initiated into Vedic study by upanayana, can offer water to his father, perform the navaśrāddhas (mentioned above in n. 593) and repeat such mantras as sundhantām pitarah&rsquo; required in these rites, but since he has no srauta or grhya fire of his own he can not per form such śrāddhas as the pārvana. The Smrtyarthasara (p. 56) provides that boys whose upanayana has not been per formed, women and südras should get śrāddhas performed through a priest or they may themselves perform them without mantras but only mention the name and gotra of the deceased or with the two mantras &lsquo;devebhyo namah&rsquo; and &lsquo;pitrbhyah svadhā namah&rsquo;. The above discussion shows that men and women, adults as well as children, those who are upanita as well as those that are anupanāta are under an obligation to per form śräddha.</p>
<p>Tai. S. I. 8. 5.1, Tai. Br. I. 6.9 (which will be quoted later on) show that srāddha was offered to three immediate ancestors, father, grand-father, great-grand-father. The Baud. Dh. S. (I. 5. 113-115) states that there is a group of seven persons closely knit together that is called avibhaktadāya sapindas viz. great-grand-father, grand-fathsr, father, the man himself (who</p>

<p>Visņu Dh. S. 15. 46 ) solemnly 835 affirms: &lsquo;by (the birth of) a son a man wins the worlds (heaven &amp;c.), he secures immor tality by a grandson and by the grandson of a son he reaches the abode of the Sun&rsquo;. This verse shows that all the three descendants of a person confer equally great spiritual benefit on him. Yāj. also (in 1. 78) lumps the three together (without making any distinction between them) when he says since a man securos perpetuation of lineage and heaven by means of son, grand-son and great-grand-son&rsquo;. Therefore when Manu (IX. 106 ) says that by the birth of a son a man discharges his debt to his progenitors the Dāyabhāga (XI. 34) explains that the word putra stands for the three descendants up to the great grandson, since all the three are entitled to perform the pār vana-śrāddha and equally benefit the ancestors by the pindas they offer, and that the word putra is not to be taken literally but only as illustrative in order to include the great-grandson since one may with difficulty find a text expressly mentioning the adhikära of the grandson (as a performer of śräddha and taker of wealth) but there is no text expressly mentioning the great-grandson separately (as the taker of wealth and giver of piņda ) 836. On Yāj. II. 50 which lays down that when the father dies or has gone to a distant country or is overwhelmed by calamities (incurable diseases or the like) his debts should be paid by the sons or grandsons, the Mit. adds that even when a son or grandson receives no ancestral property the father&rsquo;s debts must be paid, the only difference being that the son has to pay the principal as well as the interest, while the grandson</p>

<p>Meaning of &lsquo;putra&rsquo;</p>
<p>367</p>
<p>has to return only the principal and has to pay no interest and the Mit. quotes a verse of Brhaspati 837 where all the three descendants are mentioned in one breath and the Mit. adds that the great-grandson has not to pay even the principal if he has received no ancestral property. This last remark implies that the Mit, regarded that the great-grandson was also included in the extended sense of &lsquo;putra&rsquo;. Yāj. II. 51 begins by saying that whoever takes the wealth of a deceased person has to pay the latter&rsquo;s debts, so the great-grandson would have to pay the great-grand-father&rsquo;s debts if he received the assets of the grand-father. Therefore the Mit. on II. 50 expressly mentions that a great-grandson need not pay his great-grand-father&rsquo;s debts if he received no assets, because, otherwise being included in the extended meaning of putra, he would have had to pay. There was no necessity to bring in or mention the prapautra under II. 50 if the Mit. did not include the prapautra in the word putra. Again on Yāj. II. 51 (&lsquo;putrahinasya rikthinaḥ&rsquo;) the Mit. included even prapautra under the word putra. This shows that the Mit. is quite conscious that the three descendants of a man form one group and succeed to his estate and liabilities and putra includes three descendants wherever the context so requires. If the word &lsquo;putra&rsquo; is not to be taken as only illustrative and as including both grandson and great-grandson, serious difficulties will arise even in the interpretation of Yaj. on which the Mit. comments. For example, in Yāj. II. 135-136 it is said that when a gonless man dies his wife, daughters and other heirs (named there ) succeed one after another. If ‘putra&rsquo; is taken to mean only son&rsquo; and no one else, then on the death of a man without a son his wife or daughter (whoever is alive ) will take the wealth even if a son&rsquo;s son exists. But that would be absurd and is not stated by any one. Therefore the word putra has to be interpreted in a wider sense in a proper context. Many works such as the Vyavahāramayukha, the Viramitrodaya, the Dattakamimāngā interpret the word &lsquo;putra&rsquo; as including three generations. Therefore, though the Mit. in its remarks on inheritance and succession expressly names the son and grand</p>

<p>son only (lit. it should have mentioned only the son) it must be taken as including the great-grandson also, particularly in view of the fact that it refers to the great-grandson in its comment on Yāj. I, 50 and 51 as taking the riktha which the Mit. (on Yāj. II, 114) interprets as aptratibandha dāya. Baud., Manu, Yājñavalkya speak of the three descendants and Sankha likhita, Vas. XI. 39 and Yama employ 838 only the word putra or suta in relation to the three ancestors. Therefore, the remark of Dr. Kapadia in &lsquo;Hindu Kinship&rsquo;on p. 162 Vijñāne śvara understands by the word putra sons and grandsong only! is unjustified. It is impossible to hold with Dr. Kapadia that the Mit. ran counter to the express dicta of renowned Smrtis such as those of Manu, Sankha-Likhita and Puranas like the Vişnu-puräpa III. 13,30 (quoted above in note 582) and that in its remarks on succession it forgot its own interpretation of putra on Yaj. II. 51. He has also not correctly understood the words of the Mit, introducing Yāj. II. 137: &lsquo;sons and grandsons take the wealth; in their absence, the wife and others; thus it is said (by me). This is wrong for several reasons. &ldquo;Wife and others take the wealth&rsquo; is said by Yāj. (in II. 135-36). The following words are &rsquo;now (the author) declares an exception to both.&rsquo; This clearly refers to Yāj. (II. 137) and not to Vijñāne śyara and so &lsquo;uktam&rsquo; also must refer to Yāj. and not to Vijñāneśvara. Therefore, according to the Mit, the great-grand son is included in the extended meaning of the word &lsquo;putra&rsquo;, is entitled just like a son or a grandson to offer śrāddha (in default of a son or grandson) and to take the wealth and pay the debts of the ancestor. In the matter of payment of debts there is, on account of the difference in the period that elapses, a difference between all the three descendants if no ancestral wealth is left by the ancestor, viz. the son pays the debt with interest, the grandson only the principal lent but without interest and the great-grandson nothing at all. This shows that even between the son and the grandson that are expressly mentioned by Yaj. * II. 50 as to the payment of debts there is a difference and that as the great-grandson had to pay nothing when no ancestral property existed he was not mentioned at all in Yāj. II, 50,</p>

<p>Just as the king is an ultimate heir and also the guardian of all minors, so he is like the son of a person (who has no relatives left) for performing śrāddhas.</p>
<p>The next question is about the times when śrāddha is to be performed. It has been seen above (vide H, of Dh. vol. II. p. 696 ff) that long before the time of the Sat. Br. five daily observances (called Mahāyajñas) were prescribed for each house-holder, viz. the sacrifice to beings, that to men, that to the Fathers, that to the gods and that to Veda. The Sat. Br. and the Tai. Ā. (II. 10) say further that this daily rite in which one offers svadhā (food) to the Fathers even up to water was called pitryajña, Manu III. 70 defines pitryajña as tarpana (satiating ancestors with the offerings of water). Manu III. 82 provides that an householder should daily perform a srāddha with food or with water or with milk, roots and fruits and thus please the Fathers. Srāddha originally meant a sacrifice performed for the Fathers on Amāvāsyä (vide Gaut. 15.1-2).838a By applying that word to the daily oftering of water to the Manes what is intended to be conveyed is that the special characteristics of śräddha in the strict sense are to be extended to this daily rite so far as possible. Amāvāsyā is of two kinds, Sinivāli and Kuhū. Those who keep srauta fires should perform śrāddha on the former, while those who have not kept srauta fires and südras should offer sraddha on the latter.</p>
<p>Srāddhas are divided into three classes, nitya, naimittika and kāmya. An observance is called nitya when it is laid down that it must be performed on a certain or fixed occasion (such as every day, on an amāväsyä, or on Aştakā day). What is laid down for being done on an occasion which is uncertain is called naimittika (such as the birth of a son). What is ordained to be done in case one desires a certain reward or fruit is called kāmya (e.g. the performance of a śrāddha on Krttikā or Rohiņi by one who desires heaven or progeny ). The five daily yajñas including pitr-yajña are nitya i. e. they must be per formed without any eye to any reward therefrom and the</p>

<p>non-performance thereof will lead to sinfulness. Passages mentioning the rewards that follow from the performance of obligatory ( nitya ) rites are only laudatory, they only convey that such performances make a man pure, but it is not meant that they are not obligatory and may be performed only if a person desires the rewards or results promised (i, e. such performances are not kāmya). Āp. Dh, S. (II. 7. 16. 4-7) provides certain times for the performance of śräddha viz, that it must be performed in the latter half of every month, that the afternoon is preferable for it, that the last days of the latter half of each month are preferable to the first days of the latter half. Gaut, 15. 3 and Vas. XI. 16 say that śrāddha may be performed on any day of the dark half of a month after the 4th day and Gaut. 15. 5 adds that if particularly appro priate materials or particularly holy brāhmaṇas are available or the performer is near a very sacred place (such as Gaya) a śrāddha may be performed on any day. Kurma (II. 20. 23) says the same thing. The Agnipurāna 115. 8 says that at Gayā a srāddha may be performed on any day (na kālādi Gayātirthe dadyāt pindāśca nityasah). Manu (III, 276-278) provides that the days of the dark half of the month beginning with the 10th but excepting the 14th 838b are recommended for śrāddha, that one performing a śrāddha on even lunar days (i. e, on the 10th, 12th) and on the even naksatras (i. e. on Bharani, Rohiņi &amp;c.) gains the fulfilment of all his desires, that one who worships the Manes on uneven days (11th, 13th &amp;c.) and on uneven constellations (Krttikā, Mrgasiras &amp;c.) obtains pro sperous offspring and that just as the latter half of a month is</p>

<p>grareatata. This only means that sraddha should not be performed for anyone on the 14th of the dark half except for those who were killed by poison or by beasts, snakes, lower animals or brahmanas or in battle. But a sräddha may be performed on any tithi of the dark half for those killed in battle or by poison &amp;c. It should be noted that Manu prescribes (III. 282) that an āhitāgni should not perform a sraddha except on darsa, from which it follows that only others (who had no srauta fires) could offer srāddha on any day of the dark half. Vide F actor VI, 204, 24-27 and VI. 219.19-21 for the proposition that srāddha should be performed on the 14th tithi of the dark &ldquo;half of Bhadrapada for those who met a violent death by poisoning or forle For</p>

(I. 217-218), the Kurma (II 20.2-8), Mārkandeya (28. 20 ff) and Varāhapurāņa 13. 33–35 sum up in one place the times for performing śräddhas as follows: Amāvāsyā, the Astakā days, lucky days (such as the birth of a son), dark half of a month, the two ayanas (the two days on which the sun appears to start towards the south or north i. e. solstices), possession of sufficient materials (such as rice and pulse or meat), the arrival of a worthy brāhmana, the equinoctial points (vişuvat, i. e. the sun&rsquo;s apparent en trance into Aries and Balance), the days on which the sun passes into one rāśi from another, the astrological conjunctions called Vyatīpāta 838c, Gajacchāyā, eclipses of the sun and the moon, when the performer has an intense desire to perform śräddha-these are times for performing śrāddha The Mārkan</p>

Bana mentions Vyatipata in his हर्षचरित. व्यतीपात is also defined in another way with reference to Rasis. पञ्चाननस्थौ गुरुभूमिपुत्री मेषे रविः स्याद्यदि शुक्लपक्षे । पाशाभिधाना करभेन युक्ता तिथिय॑तीपात इतीह योगः॥. by श्रा.</p>

<p>deya 838d (chap. 28. 22-23), adds that śräddha should be perform ed when a man dreams an evil dream and when evil planets affect the naksatra of his birth. In an eclipse the appropriate time for śrāddha is what is called Sparsa Kāla 839 (i. e. when the eclipse begins), as stated in a verse of VỊddha-Vasistha. The Brahmapurāṇa (220. 51-54) contains all the times specified by Yāj. and a few more. Vide also Skandapurāņa VII, 1. 30-32, Visnupurāņa TII, 14. 4-6, Padma (srsti 9. 128-129). Acc. to Vişņu Dh. S. 76. 1-2, Amāväsyä, the three Astakās and the three Anvastakās, the 13th day of the dark half of Bhādrapada on which the moon is in Maghā, Sarad and Vasanta are obliga tory (nitya) times for śräddha and that if a person does not per form śrāddha on these days he goes to Hell. Visnu Dh, S. (77.1-7) states that the day of the sun&rsquo;s passage from one sign of the zo diac to another, the two equinoctial days, particularly the sols ticial days, Vyatipāta, the constellation on which the performer is born, a time of rejoicing (son&rsquo;s birth or the like )&ndash;these are kāmya times and a srāddha performed on these occasions gives infinite pleasure (to the Manes). The Kūrmapurāņa (Uttarārdha 16. 6-8) says that śrāddhas called kāmya are commended on eclipses, solstice days, equinoctial days and on Vyatipāta and they give infinite pleasure (to the Manos) and srāddha per formed on Sankranti (sun&rsquo;s passage from one sign of the zodiac to another) is inexhaustible and so also on days of birth and on the several naksatras śrāddhas should be performed. Ap. Dh, S. II. 7. 16. 8-22, Anusāsana 87, Väyu 89. 10-19, Yāj. I 262-263. Brahmapurāņa 220.15-21, Vişnu Dh. S. 78. 36-50, Kūrmapurāna (IL 20,19-22), Brahmānda III. 17.10-22 state what rewards a man gets if he performs śräddhas on each of the days from the first to the 15th of the dark half. These lists do not completely agree with each other. That of Ap. being probably the most ancient, is set out here:-Śrāddha performed on each of the 15 days of the dark half respectively yields the following results in order, viz. progeny chiefly consisting of females (on 1st tithi</p>

A man can perform a sraddha on any tithi of the dark half of a month, but he should not perform it on a tithi when the moon is in the naksatræ on which he was born or in Purva-bhadrapada or in Uttarābhādrapada or Kritikā, Ārdrä, Aslesā or Müla or in a nakşatra, which is 5th, 14th or 23rd from the naksatra of his birth.</p>

Amāyāsyā). Gārgya (q. by Par. M. I. 2 p. 324) provides that one should not perform śrāddha on Nandā, on Friday, on 13th of the dark half and on the nakşatra of birth and the preceding and the following naksatras for fear of losing one&rsquo;s sons and wealth. The Nandā tithis are 1st, 6th and 11th. The Anušāsana-parva (87.16) provides that he who performs śräddha on the 13th tithi attains pre-eminence among his agnates, but then the young men in his house die as a consequence.</p>
<p>The śrāddhas performed on the days mentioned in Vişnu Dh, S. 77.1-6 are naimittika and those performed on certain tithis and days of the week for securing certain rewards would be kūmya śräddhas. According to Par. M. I. 1 p. 63 the per formance of obligatory (nitya) actions is samskäraka (i. e. effects a purifying change in the mind making it fit for higher things ), while in some cases it may also produce the desire to know the Reality behind the appearances (i. e. it is &lsquo;vividisa janaka&rsquo; as indicated by the Gitā 9. 27). Jaimini (VI. 3.1-7) establishes the proposition that the nitya acts (such as Agni hotra, Darsa-pürņamāsa-yāga ) must be performed even though the performer is unable to perform a subsidiary part of the rite; while Jai. VI. 3. 8-10 provide that every part of kāmya actions must be performed and if the performer thinks that he would be unable to perform all he should not undertake to perform a kāmya rite at all. 839a</p>

<p>tively secure happiness (or admiration by people ), victory in battle, all desires, such learning as he desires, wealth and long life. The Kūrma (II. 20, 16-17) also expatiates on the rewards for śräddhas on the several days of the week.</p>
<p>The Vişnu-Dharmasūtra (78. 8-15 ) mentions what rewards follow from performance of srāddhas on the 28 naksatras from Krttikā to Bharaṇi (including Abhijit which is placed after Uttarāsādhā and before Sravana). Yāj. I. 265-268, Väyu chap. 82, Mārkandeya-purāna 30, 8-16, Kūrma (II, 20. 9-15), Brahmapurāņa 220, 33-42, Brahmānda ( Upodghātapāda 18.1 ff) also deal with the same topic, but all these works do not present complete agreement. For example, Visnu Dh. S. and Yāj. agree that śrāddha performed on Křttikā, Rohiņi, Aśvini and Bharani yield as rewards heaven, offspring, horses and longe vity, but they disagree in several others e. g. while Vispu says that prosperity, beauty (or happiness ) and all desires are obtained by performing śrāddha on the Pusya, Aśleşā and Maghā nakşatras respectively, Yāj. provides that a śräddha on these three yields strength, son and eminence. The Anu sāsanaparva 89 and Vayupurāņa 82 set out the rewards of śrāddhas on the several nakşatras from Krttikā as declared by Yama to Sasabindu.</p>
<p>It is stated in the Agnipurāņa 840 that śrāddhas performed at a holy place and on days that are called Yugādi and Man vādi yield inexhaustible gratification (to the pitys). The Vispupurāna 841, Matsyapurāna (17. 4-5), Padma V. 9. 130-131, Varāhapurāna and Prajāpati-smrti verse 22 and Skanda VII, 1. 205, 33-34 state that the third tithi of Vaisakha (bright half), the 9th of the bright half of Kārtika, the 13th of the dark half of Bhädrapada and 15th tithi of the dark half of Māgha are called Yugādi tithis (i. e. the first days of the four Yugas from Kịta).</p>

In the Skandapurāņa (Nāgarakhanda) the first tithis of thirty kalpas from Sveta onwards are specified as fit for śrāddha, but are passed over here.</p>
<p>Ap. Dh. S. II. 842 7. 17. 23-25, Manu III, 280, Visņu Dh.

Visņu Dh. S. declares that śrāddha performed during an eclipse satisfies the Manes as long as the moon and stars exist and brings to the performer all advantages and the satisfaction of all his desires, while the Kūrmapurāņa threatens that he who would not perform a sraddha in an eclipse sinks (incurs sins or becomes ruined) as a cow in mud. The Mit. on Yāj. I. 217 is careful to point ont that though there is a prohibition against eating during the progress of an eclipse of the sun or moon, that prohibition would only affect the eater (the brāhmaṇa who eats śräddha repast in an eclipse) but not the giver who will secure happiness (or good results ) thereby.843</p>

<p>Very learned disquisitions are held in Aparārka p. 465 ff, Hemādri p. 313 ff and other writers and digests as to the mean ing of aparāhna which is the time for sraddha prescribed by Manu (III. 278). There are several views. Some hold that the part of the day after noon is &lsquo;after-noon.&rsquo; The word &lsquo;purvāhna&rsquo; occurs in Rg. X. 34. 11. Others relying on a śruti 844 text</p>
<p>The forenoon is for gods, mid-day for men and afternoon for pitěs&rsquo; hold that the third part of the day divided into three parts is &lsquo;aparähọa.&rsquo; A third view is that aparāhna is the 4th part of the day divided into five parts and they rely 845 on Sat. Br. II. 2.3.9. The five parts are called pratah, saigava, madhyandina (or madhyahna), aparahna and sayahna (or sayam or astagamana). The first three are expressly mentioned even in the Rgveda V. 76. 3. Prajāpati-snirti (verses 156-157) says that each of these five parts extends over three muhurtas (the day being divided into fifteen muhūrtas). It further states that kutapa is the 8th muhūrta from sunrise and that sräddha should be begun in kutapa and should not last beyond Rauhina muhūrta and that five muhurtas (from 8th to 12th) are the maximum time for śrāddha, 846 The word kutapa has eight meanings as noted by the Sm. c. (śrāddha) p. 433 and Hemādri on śräddha p. 320. The word is derived from ku&rsquo; meaning &lsquo;condemned&rsquo; (i.e.sin) and &rsquo;tapa&rsquo; means &lsquo;what burns.&rsquo; The eight 847 meanings of &lsquo;kutapa&rsquo; are &lsquo;midday, a vessel of rhinoceros horn, woollen seat or blanket</p>

<p>from Nepal, silver, darbhas, sesame, cows and daughter&rsquo;s son.&rsquo; The general rule is that srāddhas are performed in the afternoon (but this applies to śrāddha on New moon, Mahālaya, Astakā and Anvastakā śräddhas ), while Vrddhiếrāddha and śrāddha in which only corn is offered (āmaśräddha) are performed in the morning. Medhātithi on Manu III. 245 quotes a smrti text on this. 848 The Trikāpdamandana (II. 150, 162) provides that when it is not possible to perform a religious rite at the time prescribed for it as appropriate, it should be performed at some other time thereafter and that, between the proper time of a rite and the means, the former is to be preferred and one should not wait for a time later than the proper one with the desire of being able to collect all the principal materials. 848a</p>
<p>A few words must be said about the proper places for the performance of a śrāddha. Manu (III, 206-207 ) lays down that the performer should make efforts to secure a spot sloping to the south and smear it with cow dung, a spot that is pure and unfrequented by many persons) and that the Fathers are pleased by śräddha at naturally clean spots or the banks of rivers and spots that are unfrequented. Yāj. I. 227 very briefly puts the requirements by saying that the place of śrāddha should be covered on all sides, should be pure and sloping to the south. Sankha says : 849 one should not perform śrāddha on the backs of bulls, elephants and horses, nor on raised earth platforms nor on land owned by others.&rsquo; The Kūrmapurāņa states 850 &lsquo;Forests. sacred mountains, holy places, temples-these have no (definite) owner and they cannot be private property (of any one )&rsquo;. Yama provides 851 if one offers sraddha to his pitrs in spots</p>

Therefore, a man should perform srāddha on holy spots, on river banks, in sacred places and particularly in land belonging to himself, in bowers near hills and on mountain tops.&rsquo; The Vişnudharma-sūtra chap. 85 mentions numerous holy places and then adds in these and other tirthas, big rivers, on all natural sandy banks, near streams, on mountains, in bowers, forests, groves and spots that look charming because of being smeared with cowdung ( sraddha may be performed ).&rsquo; Sankha (14. 27–29 ) states &lsquo;whatever is given in holy Gayā, in Prabhāsa, Puşkara, Prayāga, in the Naimisa forest (on the Sarasvati), on the banks of the Ganges, Yamunā, Payosni, on Amarakantaka, on Narmadā, in Benares, in Kuruksetra, Bhrgutunga, on the Himalaya, on Sapta-Veni, on Rşikūpa&ndash;all that becomes inex haustible.&rsquo; The Brahmapurāpa ( 220.5-7) also specifies river banks, lakes, mountain tops, sacred spots like Puskara as the proper places for sraddha. The Vāyupurāna, chap. 77 and Matsya 22 contain long lists of sacred places, countries, moun tains in relation to śräddhas. The Kalpataru (sräddha p. 40) and Sr. P. p. 147 state that special characteristics of the tirthas in the several countries that are declared to be fit places for śräddha should be understood from the inhabitants of those various countries.</p>

Magadha ) is not fit for sraddha; similarly the countries called Käraskara, Kalinga, the country to the north of the river Sindhu and all countries where the system of varnas and āśramas is not in existence should be sedulously avoided for śräddhas, The Brahmapurāna (220.8-10) makes the somewhat startling remark that the following countries should be avoided for śräddhas viz, the Kirāta country, Kalinga, Konkapa, Krimi (Krivi?), Daśārņa, Kumärya (Cape Comorin), Tangapa, Kratha, the northern banks of the Sindhu river and the south bank of Narmadā and the east of the Karatoyā.</p>
<p>The Markandeyapurāņa 854 prescribes that for a śrāddha a place (ground) that is full of insects, that is arid, or is burnt by fire, from which proceed sounds that are painful to the ear, that is terrific in its aspect, that emits fetid smell should be avoided.</p>
<p>It was also provided from very early times that certain persons and animals are to be ejected from the place where śrāddha is to be performed and are not to be allowed to pollute the śrāddha rite by looking at it or by disturbing it in various other ways. Gaut. (15. 25-28) provides that food seen by dogs, capdalas and those guilty of mahāpātakas becomes unclean (and so unfit); therefore one should offer śräddha in a covered (or screened) place; or he should strew round about the place sesame or a worthy brāhmaṇa who purifies a row of diners by his presence should perform a sānti for removing the taint caused (by a dog or cāņdāla seeing the food &amp;c). Ap. Dh. S, prescribes that the learned condemn the seeing of a śrāddha by dogs and those who (being palita) are excommunicated and that a leper, a bald man, one having sexual intercourse with another&rsquo;s wife, the son of a brālmaņa who follows the profes sion of arms, the son of a brāhmana woman from a südra man if these eat śrāddha food they pollute the diners sitting to eat in a row. Manu (III. 239-242) states: a candāla, a village pig or cock, a dog, a woman in her monthly illness, an impotent person-these should not be allowed to see brāhmapas engaged in taking dinner. Whatever is seen by these at a homa</p>

A pig taints food ( offered to gods or Manes) by merely smelling it, a cock by setting in motion the air with its wings, a dog by casting a glance and a man of low caste by touch. If a servant of even the person who offers srāddha is lame or squint-eyed or has a limb loss or more (i. e. having eleven or nine fingers &amp;c.), he should be ejected from the place where śrāddha is to be per formed.&rsquo; It is provided by the Anušāsanaparva (127.13) that śrāddha food should not be seen by a woman in her monthly illness or by a sonless woman or by one suffering from white leprosy. Vişnu-dharmasutra (82, 3 ff) contains a long list of about 30 persons who are not to be allowed near a śrāddha. The Kūrmapurāņa (II. 22. 34-35 ) states that one devoid of a limb, a patita, a leper, one suffering from an open ulcer, an atheist, a cock, a pig, a dog, should be kept far away from a śrāddha; one should also avoid one that has a disgusting appearance, an impure person, one who is naked, a mad man, a gambler, a woman in her monthly course, those that wear indigo-coloured or yellow-red garments and those who follow heretical views. The Mārkandeya 32. 20-24, Vāyu 78. 26-40, Visnupurāna III. 16. 12-14 and Anušāsanaparva 91. 43-44 also contain long lists which are passed over here.

Another classification is that into Ekoddista and Pārvapa 855. The first is offered to one deceased person alone, while the latter is performed on the amāvāsyā of a month or in the dark half of Bhādrapada or on sankrānti and in it the three paternal ancestors are principally invoked.

<p>Classification of śrāddhas</p>
<p>381</p>
<p>pati quoted in the Srāddhaviveka of Rudradhara mentions five classes of Sraddhas as declared by Manu viz. nitya, naimittika, kāmya, Vrddhi and Pārvana 856. The Srāddhaviveka remarks that the sixteen pretašrāddhas (to be described later on) are included under naimittika and that such śrāddhas as Gosthi śrāddha enumerated in other smrtis are included in Pārvana. The Kurmapurana (II. 20.26) similarly speaks of the five śräddhas as enumerated by Manu 857. The Mit on Yãi. I. 217 states that there are five srāddhas, viz. &ldquo;ahar-ahah-śrāddha, parvana, vrddhisraddha, ekoddista and sapindikarana. The daily sraddha is described by Manu IIL.82 ( Sankha 13.16 and Matsya 16.4) as one that is performed every day with food (cooked rice, yavas &amp;c.) or with water or with milk, fruits and roots. Two verses of Viśvāmitra858 quoted by several works speak of twelve kinds of śräddhas, viz. nitya, naimittika, kāmya, věddhi-śrāddha (performed on the birth of a son,</p>
<p>marriage or similar incident of good luck), sapindana (sapindi karana), parvana, gosthisraddha, suddhisraddha, karmānga, daivika, yātrāśrāddha, pustiśrāddha. Explanations of all these are quoted from the Bhavisyapurāņa by the same works. Sapindana and Pārvana will be described below. Some of the rest not already defined may be briefly explained as follows: The Gosthi-srāddha 859 is one which is performed when a man be</p>

<p>comes enthusiastic owing to a talk about sraddha or when many learned men gather together at a sacred place and, finding it impossible to have separate cooking arrangements for each, pool their resources for collecting śrāddha materials and perform simultaneously śrāddha for the pleasure it affords to themselves and for the gratification of pitrs. The Suddhi śräddha is one where brāhmanas are fed when a person under goes śuddhi ( purification) after being guilty of some sin or transgression (it is a subsidiary act in a prāyaścitta). That sräddha is called &lsquo;karmānga&rsquo; which is performed at the time of the Garbhādhāna rite or at the performance of a soma sacrifice, or at simantonnayana, pumsavana (it is like Vrddhisrāddha ). That is called daivika śrāddha which is intended to propitiate gods ( it is like nityagräddha and is performed on the 7th or 12th tithi or the like with sacrificial food). When a man going to a distant country on a pilgrimage or the like performs a sräddha in which clarified butter is served ( to brāhmapas ) in abundance or when he comes back to his house, that is yātra srāddha. That is called pustiśrāddha which is performed for the health (or fattening ) of the body (when taking some medicine for the purpose ) or for the increase of one&rsquo;s wealth. Out of these 860 twelve the principal ones are pārvana, ekoddi şta, vrddhi and sapindana. There are works called Şan-navati-śräddha such as those of Sivabhatta, son of Govinda, and of Raghunātha. The 96 śräddhas to be performed in a year are briefly enumerated in a verse 861 quoted in the note. They are: 12 srāddhas on</p>

Vaidhrti) and the 13 śrāddhas on the Vyatipāta yoga, the 16 Mahalaya śräddhas, the four Anvaştakā days (according to Ašv. as noted on pp. 359-360), the four Astakā days and the four days (i.e. 7th of dark half of the months of Hemanta and Sisira) of the day previous (to the Astakā). These classifications and enumerations of śrāddhas will afford an idea how the doctrine of śräddhas was carried to an exaggerated extent in the course of centuries. It goes without saying that only a few people could have indulged in the luxury of so many sraddhas a year and most people were content with the performance of only one Mahälayaśräddha and one or two more. It may be noted that Manu (III. 122) first prescribed that on the amāvāsyā of each month an elaborate grāddha should be performed, but knowing that this was almost impossible Manu recommends to all (III. 281) that an elaborate sraddha should be performed on three amāvāsyās in one year 862 (viz. in Hemanta, Grisma and Varșa ) and one should perform every day the sraddha which is one of the five daily sacrifices (III. 82-83). Devala went further and recommended that an elaborate śrāddha may be performed only once a year.</p>

In this connection many works contain high eulogies of brähmanas, but they are passed over here, as the eulogy of brähmanas has been already dealt with at some length in H. of Dh. vol. II, pp. 37-38, 135-138. It may be noted that the gļhyasūtras contain a few requirements, but as we proceed the smrtis and purānas go on adding qualifications and enlarging the lists of those that should not be invited. For example, the Āśv. Gr. 862a IV. 7.2, San, Gr. IV.1. 2, Ấp, G. VIII. 21. 2, Ấp. Dh, S, II, 7. 17. 4, Hir. Gr. II, 10.2, Baud. Gr.

The Ap. Dh. S. states that he who has studied the three Vedic verses in which the word &lsquo;madhu&rsquo; occurs (Rg. I. 90.6-8, Vāj. S. 13. 27-29. Tai, S.

<p>Who should be invited at śrāddha</p>
<p>385</p>
<p>who has studied the Veda and is able to teach the whole Veda with its angas, a śrotriya&ndash;these persons sanctify the company if they eat at a funeral repast. Gaut. 15. 28, Baud. Dh. S. II, 8.2, Manu III. 185-186, Yāj. I. 219, Varahapurāna 14.2 contain almost the same words about those who sanctify the company of diners (i. e. who are pankti pāvana). The Anusāsanaparva (90.25-31), Kūrmapurāna II. 21.1-14, Matsya 16. 7-13, Brahmapurāna 220. 101-104, Väyu 79.56-59 and 83.5R-55, Skanda VI. 217. 21-25 give long lists of pankti pāvana brāhmaṇas. The Hir. Gr. II. 10.2, Baud, Dh. S. II. 2. 7, Kūrma (II. 21. 14) and others say that a performer of śrāddha should invite one who is not a relative connected by marriage (such as a maternal uncle) nor one who is of the same gotra, nor one who is connected with the performer by Veda study (i. e. is his teacher or pupil), nor a friend nor one who expects monetary help from the performer. Manu (IIT, 138-139) provides that one should not invite at a śrāddha dinner a personal friend, that one may gain a friend by making valuable gifts to him (on other occasions), that one should feed at a śrāddha a brāhmana whom he does not deem either his friend or foe and that he who performs srāddhas and offer ings to gods chiefly to gain friends reaps no reward after death by those grāddhas or offerings. But Manu III. 144 (= Kūrma II, 21-22) provides that one may invite even a friend but not a foe though the latter may be learned. Manu (III. 135-137 and 145-147 ) lays down that the main or best rule to be followed is to present śrāddha food to those who are devoted to spiritual knowledge, that between a man who has studied one whole recension of the Veda but whose father was not a śrotriya and one who is himself not a śrotriya but whose father had studied a whole recension of the Veda (i. e.whose father was a śrotriya) the latter is the more worthy of the two, that one should strive to feed at a śräddha an adherent of the Rgveda who has studied one entire recension of that Veda or a follower of the Yajurveda who has studied one Sakhā thereof or a singer of sāmans who has finished one recension of the Sāmaveda and that if one of these preceding three is honoured and dines at a śrāddha, the ancestors of the performer will be gratified up to the seventh generation for a very long time. Harita (q. by Hemādri on grāddha p. 392 and Kalpataru on śr. pp. 66-67) describes the qualifications of those who are pānkteya brāhmaṇasyiz, they must be born in a high family (possessing four characteri stics), must be endowed with learning ( of six kinds ) and sila</p>

<p>(character of 13 kinds) and good conduct (of 16 kinds). Sankha Likhita 863 give a long list of pānkteya (fit to be associated with in a pankti i. e. row of diners) brāhmaṇas, viz, he who knows the Veda and the Vedāngas (viz. phonetics, kalpa or srauta ritual, grammar, Nirukta, metrics and astronomy); one who keeps the five fires; one who has studied the Veda with its angas; one who knows Sankhya, Yoga, Upanişads and Dharma śāstra; a śrotriya, a triņāciketa, trimadhu, trisuparņaka and one that has studied Jyesthasāman; one who has studied Sankhya, Yoga, Upanişads and Dharmaśāstra; who is devoted to Veda; who always keeps sacred fires; who is obedient to his parents and devoted to Dharmaśāstra. Similar rules are laid down by Visnu Db. S. 83, Brhat-Parāśara p. 150, Vrddha-Gau tama p. 581, Prajāpati verses 70-72, Laghu-Sätātapa verses 99 100, Aušanasasmrti (Jiv. vol. I. pp. 523-524). As Medhatithi 864 on Manu III 147 says the gist of all these passages is that a learned brāhmana who has studied the Veda, whose conduct is good, whose family is famous, who is the son of a śrotriya father and who is not related to the performer must be invited and all the rest is mere arthavāda (by way of eulogy). Manu (III. 128) laid down two propositions viz, all food offered as sacrifice to the gods and manes must be given only to a brāh mapa who studies the Veda and that whatever is presented to the most worthy brāhmaṇa (among brāhmaṇas studying the Veda) brings in the greatest rewards. Then Manu (III. 183) declares that panktipāvana brāhmaṇas are those that sanctify a row of diners among whom sit some who are tainted by (latent) blemishes that make them unfit to be among the diners. Then Manu (III. 184-186) gives examples of panktipāvana brāh manas viz, those who are the foremost among students of all the Vedas or their expository works and who are born in a family of unbroken descant of Vedic students, who are Trinā ciketa &amp;c. Hemādri (on śr, pp. 391-395) and Kalpataru (śr. pp. 64-65) quote numerous verses from Yama on panktipāvana.</p>
<p>Manu III, 147 asserts that the best course is to invite a brāhmana who fulfils the conditions laid down in Manu III.</p>

<p>132-146, but adds that if it is not possible to secure such a brāhmana then the next best course 865 (anukalpa&rsquo;) may be followed, viz. the performer may invite his own maternal grand father, his maternal uncle, sister&rsquo;s son, father-in-law, his teacher of the Veda, daughter&rsquo;s son, son-in-law, a bandhu (such as mother&rsquo;s sister&rsquo;s son), wife&rsquo;s brother or a sagotra, or his family priest, or his pupil. Similar provisions occur in Yāj. I. 220, Kūrma (Uttarārdha 21. 20), Varāhapurāņa 14. 3, Matsya 16. 10-11, Visnupurāņa III. 15. 2-4 (anukalpeşvanantaran). But Manu is careful 866 to point out in a later chapter that one who is able to observe the best course, but observes the second best does not reap other-worldly rewards by his actions. Even Āp. Dh, S. 867 expressly says that if strangers do not possess the requisite qualifications, then even one&rsquo;s full brother possessed of all the qualifications (as to Vedic learning, good conduct &amp;c.) and pupils may be fed at a śräddha. Baud. Dh. S. also allows even a sapiņda to be fed. 868 Gaut. 15. 20 appears to be of the view that even pupils and sagotras may be invited when they are possessed of excellent qualities and strangers with good qualifications are not available. Even in these times very learned brāhmanas are un willing to be fed at a śräddha, particularly within a few years (three or five ) from the death of the person for whose benefit the śrāddha is to be performed. Smrtis attach a certain stigma to the fact of being the recipient of a śrāddha dinner and prāyaścittas are prescribed. For example, the Mit, on Yāj. III. 289 quotes several verses of Bhāradvāja, one of which says &ldquo;If a brāhmana dines at a pārvaņa śräddha he has to perform six prāņāyāmas (as expiation), if he dines at a śrāddha from the third month after a person&rsquo;s death to one year, he has to undergo a fast; if he dines at a yrddhisräddha, he has to per form three prāņāyāmas, and a fast for a day and night if he dines at a sapindana śräddha.&rsquo; The Mit. further quotes a</p>

<p>verse from Dhaumya which prescribes Cāndrāyana for dining at a śrāddha on the birth of a son or at simantonnayana, in a pavagrāddha eto. Vide also Nirnayasindhu III, pp. 467-468 for prāyascittas on eating srāddha dinners, The Varāhapurāna (189. 12-13) provides that if a brāhmana dies while the food offered to a preta is still in his stomach he dwells for a kalpa in a horrible hell, becomes a rākşasa and then becomes free from the sin.</p>
<p>According to Gaut. 15.10 young persons with the requisite qualifications are to be preferred to older ones, while, according to some, young men were to be invited at a śrāddha for one&rsquo;s deceased father and old men for a śrāddha for one&rsquo;s grand father. On the other hand, Āp. Dh. S. says among brāhmaṇas possessing the same qualifications, the older ones are to be preferred and among those that are old are to be preferred the poor that are anxious to earn money. 8686</p>
<p>Some of the works lay special emphasis on inviting ascetics or yogins at a śräddha dinner. The Vişnu Dh. S. states that yogins 869 are particularly pańktipāvana and quotes a stanza as recited by the pitrs ‘May (a descendant) be born in our family who feeds a brāhmaṇa yogin at a śrāddha by which we are ourselves satisfied.&rsquo; The Varāhapurāņa 14.50 says that a yogin is superior to 100 brāhmaṇas. The Mārkandeya-purāņa provides a wise man should always feed yogins at a śrāddha since the pitrs rely for support on Yoga; if a yogin is fed by being seated as the first among thousands of brāhmaṇas he saves the performer and the other diners as a boat saves men in water.&rsquo; Then it quotes stanzas sung by the pitrs (29. 32-34) to king Aila. The Saurapurāņa, after mentioning the qualifica tions (in 19.2-3),870 winds up by stating that even one may suffice provided he be a single-minded devotee of Sivä (verse 6).</p>

<p>Who should be invited at śrāddha</p>
<p>389</p>
<p>The Matsyapurāņa (16. 11-12) recommends &lsquo;He who expounds (the meaning of) texts; he who enters upon the discussion of þrauta sacrifices and he who knows the rules about the accents of sämans is a purifier of panktipāvanas; one proficient in the Sāmaveda, a Vedic student, one endowed with knowledge of the Veda or of Brahma &ndash;where these are fed in a śräddha it yields the highest benefit.&rsquo; 871 Though in the above passages the greatest emphasis was laid on the possession of Vedic learning by the brahmanas to be fed, one had also to see whether they were men of good character and observers of the rules of proper conduct, as provided by Aśy, Gr. IV. 7. 2 (note 862), Gaut. 15.9 and Manu II, 118 who says &lsquo;a brālmana 872 knowing only the sacred Gāyatri but living a well-regulated life is to be preferred and not one who knows the three Vedas but who is not well-regulated in conduct and who eats anything (even forbidden food ) and who is a vendor of everything.&rsquo; The Skandapurāna VI. 217. 27 recommends that one should make every effort to know the family of the brāhmaṇas, then their character (sila), then their age and then the facts about whom they marry or to whom they give their daughters in marriage. The Brahmäņda (Upodghāta, chap. 15) says that there should be no scrutiny of a brāhmana about whom nothing is known because siddhas (yogins) roam about on the earth in the form of brāhmaṇas. But if faults in a brāhmana are easily seen or if one knows his disqualifica tions on account of one&rsquo;s dwelling near him, he should not be invited (verses 5-6). The same Purāna (Upodghāta 15. 24-26) arranges the orders of preference as follows: first yati (ascetic), then a brāhmaṇa who knows the four Vedas and itihāsa, then one who knows three Vedas, then one who knows two, then one who knows one Veda, then one who is an upādhyāya. Hemādri (on śrāddha p. 443) quotes the Agni purāņa 873 as follows: &lsquo;what is the use of (birth in a) famous</p>

<p>family if the man is himself devoid of good conduct? Are not insects found in fragrant flowers ?&rsquo; Jātükarnya says &lsquo;one should not honour even with a word (much less with food &amp;c.) in rites for gods and Manes bad brāhmaṇas void of good conduct, even though they be endowed with learning and be born in a good family. This insistence on worth was due to the conception that pitrs assuming an aerial form enter brāhmaṇas at the time of śrāddha. Vide Brahmāndapurana (Upodghātapāda 11. 49).solaaaaa</p>
<p>These requirements of learning, character and good conduct would naturally make it incumbent on the performer of a śräddha to inquire into the antecedents, qualities and defects of the brāhmanas to be invited. Manu and others lay down several rules about the testing of the brāhmaṇas to be invited. Manu III, 149, Visnu Dh.874 S. 82.1-2. provide at an offering to the gods let a man not enquire into (the qualities of a brāhmaṇa ( when he wants to invite ), but at a śräddha offering to the Manes close inquiry (into qualities ) is declared to be proper and just.&rsquo; Manu III. 130 says that even if a brāhmana be master of the Veda, one should enquire far (into his ancestry). The Vāyupurāpa 875 appears to provide that inquiry into the qualifications of ) brāhmaṇas should not be always undertaken when gifts are to be made, but enquiry is declared (necessary) in the case of rites for gods and Manes. The Anusā ganaparva provides 876 that in rites meant for gods a ksatriya knowing the rules about gifts should not (closely) inquire into the qualifications of brāhmaṇas, but in rites for the gods and Manes such inquiry is quite proper. Vrddha-Manu and the Matsya-purana877 lay down that a brāhmana&rsquo;s character is to be inquired into at the place where he resides for a long time, his purity by his acts and transactions with other people, his intelli gence by discussion with him: with these three one should inquire whether the brāhmaṇa (to be invited) is a worthy person,</p>

<p>Inquiring into qualifications</p>
<p>391</p>
<p>The Nrsimhapuräna 878 forbids close inquiry into the character and learning of one who comes by chance as a guest at the time of śrāddha. That inquiry was allowed as to brāhmaṇas who were invited and not as to those who came by chance uninvited as atithis. There are no doubt certain passages particularly in the Puranas where scrutiny into a brähmana&rsquo;s qualifications is condemned. For example, the Skandapurāņa quoted by Apa rärka (p. 455) and Kalpataru (on śr. p. 102) states * The Vedic revelation is that śrāddha is to be offered to a brāhmana) after inquiry (into his learning and character), but straightforward action is better than scrutiny. When one offers sraddha straightforwardly without inquiry his pitrs are gratified and also gods&rsquo;. The Bhavisyapurāpa (q. by Balambhatti ) states &lsquo;it is my view also that one should not test (the qualifications of) brāhmaṇas; one should only consider their caste and not their virtues&rsquo;. Such passages are explained away as referring to a śräddha at sacred places or as applicable to gifts or to atithis (vide Hemädri on śräddha p. 513, and Bälambhatti on ācāra p. 494 ) 878a</p>
<p>Brähmaņas were declared to be apānkteya 879 (not fit to sit in the row of brähmana diners or as defiling a row of diners at sräddha) on various grounds, such as bodily and mental defects and diseases, pursuit of certain avocations, moral lapses, being guilty of crimes, being followers of unorthodox systems, being inhabitants of certain countries. A distinction has to be made between brāhmanas who should not be invited and brāhmanas that are apānkteya or panktidūşaka. For example, one should not ordinarily invite a friend or a sagotra brāhmaṇa even</p>

Manu III. 170-182 indulge in pointing out how feeding such unworthy brāhmanas results in the loss of the gratification of pitrs and state that the food eaten by such unworthy persons becomes or is to be deemed as equal to foul things. The Kūrmapurāna 882 forbids inviting at śrāddhas Bauddha ascetics, Nirgranthas (devotees who have withdrawn from the world and wander about naked or as beggars), those that follow the Pañcarātra and Pasupata doctrines, those that are kāpālikas (devotees of Siva of the left hand order) and other similar heretical people. The Visņupurāņa (III. 18. 70 ff) narrates how a king after a bath in a holy place talked with a heretic and had to pass in consequence through the bodies of a dog, a jackal, wolf, vulture, a crow, a crane and peacock and ultimately became freed from the taint by a bath at the ava bhrtha in an Aśvamedha sacrifice. The same Purāna provides (III. 18. 97) that one should avoid talking with or touching heretics, particularly at the time of a religious rite or when one has consecrated for a solemn sacrifice. The Vāyupurāņa 883 provides that people who are &rsquo;nagna&rsquo; should not be allowed to see a śrāddha and then defines &ldquo;nagna&rsquo; people as follows: &rsquo;the three Vedas are declared to be a protective covering for all beings and therefore those who foolishly abandon the Vedas are called &rsquo;nagna&rsquo;; those who vainly keep matted hair, those who shave their heads for no purpose, those who are nagna (naked) without any cause, those who engage in certain obser vances and mutter certain words aimlessly are called nag nādi&rsquo;. Just as certain countries were declared unfit for the performance of śrāddhas (vide note 853 above), so certain brāhmaṇas hailing from certain countries were declared in some</p>

<p>works as not fit to be invited at a śrāddha, 894 For example, the Matsyapurāņa states that brāhmaṇas that are ungrateful, that are atheists, that stay in Mleccha countries or the countries of Trisanku, Karavira, Andhra, Cina, Dravida and Konkana should be carefully avoided at the time of śrāddha. Hemādri (on śrāddha p. 505) quotes from the Saurapurāna the following: &lsquo;Brāhmaṇas hailing from the countries of Anga, Vanga, Kalinga, Saurāştra, (Kathiawar), Gurjara, Ābhira, Konkana, Dravida, Daksimāpatha, Avanti and Magadha should be avoided at śrāddhas. It will be noticed that putting the above two passages together, brāhmaṇas from half of modern India would have been ineligi ble for being invited at śrāddhas if these passages were literally followed. This was probably a counsel of perfection prompted by the false pride and prejudices of the authors of those works. The Srāddhaviveka of Rudradhara (pp. 39-41 ) contains one of the longest lists of persons unfit to be invited at a śrāddha.</p>
<p>The following reason is advanced by the Varāhapurāna 885 and others for honouring a guest who comes by chance at the time when a śrāddha rite is in progress: &ldquo;Yogins wander over the earth assuming different forms that prevent recognition, but doing good to people; therefore a wise man should honour a guest who arrives at the time of the performance of a śrāddha&rdquo;. The Bhavisya-purāņa 886 similarly says that an atithi ( guest ) at a śrāddha is one who comes when least thought of and not one who had arrived before the śrāddha rite started. The Märkandeya ( 26, 30 ) provides that one should not ask such an atithi about his gotra or caraṇa or his Vedic study nor should one consider whether he has a fine appearance. Hemādri (on śrāddha pp. 430-433 ) quotes verses from the Sivadharmottara,</p>

<p>Hemādri (Srāddhakāņda, pp. 380-385) holds an interest ing discussion as to whether a performer of śräddha belonging to one recension of a Veda must restrict himself to inviting brähmanas that are students of the same recension of the Veda or whether he can invite any brāhmana that may have studied any of the three Vedas. Some people relying on a maxim (as in the case of a bride so in the case of an offering&rsquo;) invite only brāhmaṇas of their own sākhā possessed of the qualifications above set forth. Hemādri replies that this is a wrong notion, relies on Āp. Dh. S. II. 6. 15.9 &lsquo;one should feed 887 in all (religious) acts brāhmaṇas that are pure (in their conduct) and that have studied the Veda&rsquo; and asserts that no smrti, Itihāsa, Purāņa, Gphyasūtra nor Kalpasūtra contains the restriction of inviting only brāhmanas of the performer&rsquo;s own sākhā. He further says that in such texts as &rsquo;trināciketas trimadhuh&rsquo; (quoted in note 862a above) the rule laid down is to invite brāhmaṇas that have studied different sakhās and Vedas. He rejects the idea about any restriction as to selecting a bridegroom of the same sākhā as the bride&rsquo;s father and remarks that if some people are not prepared to give their daughters in marriage to young men belonging to other śākhās, that is due to ignorance about the families and is also due to pride and vanity. He winds up by saying that in Aryavarta countries it is found on all sides that marriage connections are entered into with persons studying different sākhās but living in the same district, (such connections) not being con demned, while persons who study the same sākhā of the Veda but do not know each other do not enter into marital connec tions.888 As a contrast to this commonsense view it should be</p>

<p>ing (of food ) is eaten by a yati that knows the truth about pralcrti (primordial matter) and the gunas (sattva, rajas and tamas) reaps the reward (merit) of feeding a thousand (other brahmanas). Therefore one should feed in offerings to gods and manes an excellent yogin who is intent on true knowledge of God and others only if such a one is not available.&rsquo; Similar verses about ascetics and yogins occur in Varahapurana 14.50, Skanda (VI.217.7 ff) and Vayupuranas91 chap.71.65-73, chap.76.28 &amp;c. Brhaspati provides 892 a special rule that, if a person cannot afford to feed at a śrāddha more than one brāhmaṇa, then he should feed one who has studied the Sāmaveda, since in him all the three viz. Rks, the Yajus and Samans co-exist, that the father is pleased by Rks (i. e. by the feeding of a brahmana who has studied the Rgveda), the grand-father by Yajus, the great-grand-father by a Sāman and a chandoga (a chanter of the whole of Samaveda) is superior. A verse of Satatapa is 893 quoted to the effect that if a student of the Atharvaveda is fed in a rite for the gods or manes, that yields endless and inex haustible rewards.</p>
<p>Some of the smộtis were very strict in laying down the qualifications of brāhmaṇas to be invited at a śrāddha.

<p>author 895 further says that six persons are merely brahma bamdhus (i. e. brahmanas by birth or caste alone) viz. one who is hired by a sūdra or a king as a servant, who has a sūdra woman as his wife, who is a village priest and he who subsists by killing (animals) or by catching them. So early as the Mahābhāsya 896 it was stated that austerities (leading a life of restraint and strict observances), Vedic learning and birth (from brahmana parents) are the causes of (a man being called) a brāhmaṇa and that he who is devoid of the first two is a mere brāhmaṇa by caste (but not a real brāhmana). It is curious to note that Yama stated that, if brāhmaṇas that do not declare (or point out) the auspicious nakşatra or tithi or day or mu hūrta and other auspicious matters, eat (śrāddha) food it be comes inexhaustible.</p>
<p>But the requisite qualifications were so exacting that it must have been found almost impossible to secure for a śrāddha brāhmaṇas altogether free from any of the blemishes set out above from Manu. Gautama (15. 15-18) contains long lists 897 of over 50 kinds of brāhmanas that were not to be invited at a śrāddha dinner or at a sacrifice for gods, but Gaut, adds that according to some only those beginning with &lsquo;durvāla&rsquo; (Gaut. in 15.18) were to be shunned at a śrāddha (but could be invited at a sacrifice for the gods). The persons so to be shunned, according to some who flourished before Gautama (i. e. at least before 600 B. C.) are: a bald man, a man who has deformed nails or has black teeth (naturally), one suffering from white</p>

Vas. quotes a verse 898 as follows: If a brāhmaṇa knowing the Vedas is afflicted with physical defects which (ordinarily ) exclude a person from a row of diners, Yama declares that he is irrepro achable and that he does sanctify the row of diners. But it must be said that even in modern times emphasis is laid on</p>
<p>inviting learned and well-conducted brāhmaṇas for śrāddha. The idea (expressed by Manu III. 189 and the Padmapurāņa) persists that the pitrs enter into and hover round the invited brāhmanas and that the latter are to be looked upon as represen ting the pitrs.899 The Garudapurāna states that Yama allows the departed souls and the pitrs to visit the world of men at the time of sraddha from the nether regions.</p>

<p>Kūrma (uttarārdha 22.8) states that if a person first invites a brāhmana and then foolishly invites another (passing over the first) then he becomes a greater sinner (than the brāhmana who after accepting one invitation promises to dine at another śrāddha) and is born as a worm in human faeces. The Bhavisyapurana. 902 provides that honouring gods, pitrs and men and feeding (brāhmaṇas) should not be done without wearing an upper garment; otherwise the rite will bear no fruit.</p>
<p>About the number of brāhmaṇas to be invited at a śrāddha there were several options and several views. The Āsv. Gr. S. states 903 that at the Pārvana-śrāddha (performed on a parvan day i. e. on Amavasya), the Abhyudayika sraddha, the Ekod dista or Kāmya, the larger the number of brāhmaṇas the greater is the reward, that in no case should a person invite only one brähmaņa at a śrāddha meant for all pitrs or he may optionally invite only one brāhmaṇa except at the first śrāddha, that he may invite one, two or three brāhmaṇas for each of the three paternal ancestors. The Sān. Gr. (IV. 1,2) and Kausitaki Gr. III. 14.1-2prescribe that one should 904 invite an uneven number of brāhmanas, at least three, to sit down as (representing the ) fathers.

<p>of brahmanas, at least nine or as many as he is able (to food) and that they should be learned in the Veda and endowed with polished speech, good appearance, mature age and good character&rsquo;. If five were invited two would be for gods and three for pitrs; if soven, then four for gods and three for pitrs and so on. Vas. XI. 27 ( = Manu III, 125 = Baud. Dh. S. II. 8. 29), Yāj. I. 228, Matsya 17. 13-14, Visnupurāna III. 15.14 provide that one must feed two brāhmanas at the rite for the gods and three for the manes or one only for each of the two purposes and even a rich man should not go in for a large company. The Padma purāņa (Srsti 9.98 and 141) says the same thing. So the number of brāhmanas to be invited did not depend so much upon the means of the inviter, but upon the point whether the inviter would be able to honour them all properly and with ease. The idea was that at the same time when śrāddha was to be performed two brāhmanas should be fed for gods and three for the pitrs. When only one brāhmana could be invited or was available, Vas. (XI. 30-31) provides that portions of the several foods cooked should be put in a vessel and should be placed at the place where Vaišvadevika brāhmaṇa would have been seated, then served in a plate and the visve devāh be invoked and should be contemplated as present and then the food should be thrown into the fire or offered to a Vedic student (as alms) and then śrāddha rite should be continued Sankha 906 14.10 provides a similar rule. The result is that if a man can afford to invite only one brāhmana or can secure one only, then that brāhmaṇa is meant for the rite in honour of pitrs and the offering for the gods is to be cast into fire. Baud, Dh, S. II, 8.30, Manu TIL. 126, Vas. XI. 28, Kūrma (uttarärdha 22.28 ) contain the same verse which emphatically states &lsquo;A large company destroys these five desiderata, viz. the respectful treatment (of those invited), the securing of a proper place (such as one sloping to the south) and time, purity and (the</p>

<p>choice of) meritorious brāhmaṇas; therefore one should not desire a large company'907. The Kūrmapurāna (uttarārdha 92.32) insists that an atithi must be fed at a sraddha or other-. wise the śrāddha is not praiseworthy. Though these ancient works insisted upon the avoidance of large preparations and expenses for śrāddhas in honour of a deceased person, there were other smrtis that favoured lavish distribution of wealth in srāddhas. For exanıple, Brhaspati lays down:</p>
<p>( An heir ) should lay aside half of the wealth that comes to him (by inheritance ) for the benefit of the deceased owner and should expend it in the monthly, six-monthly and yearly śrāddhas&rsquo;. The Dāyabhāga XI. 12 approves 908 of this and also guotes Ap. Dh. S. II. 6.13.3 &ldquo;On the failure of a sapinda the teacher of the Veda takes the wealth of the deceased, on failure of the teacher, the pupil takes it and having inleri ted it he should employ it in the performance of works of charity for the benefit of the deceased&rsquo; (or he himself may enjoy it). These passages show to what lengths the cult of benefit to the soul of the deceased was carried in India by certain writers. More practical authors such as Haradatta did not relish these extreme views. In several purānas such as the Vāvu 908a and Visnu there are express directions that when a śrāddha is performed at Gayā, it should be on a profuse scale and no stinginess 909 (lit. cheating in money matters ) in spending wealth should be shown there; otherwise the performer would not reap the benefit of the performance of śrāddha at that holy place. The Padmapurāņa appears to inculcate profuse</p>

<p>Lavish expenditure recommended</p>

<p>expenditure of wealth in all śrāddhas. The Vāyupurāņa 910 (82. 26-28 ) further says that the brāhmanas of Gayā are super men, that when they are gratified (at a śrāddha) the gods together with pitrs become gratified, that no question should be raised about the family, the character, the learning and the austerities (of the Gayā brāhmaṇas), that by honouring them a man attains liberation, that a man after honouring the brāhmaṇas should proceed according to his resources and strength to the performance of śrāddha; thereby he secures all heavenly desires and obtains the means of Moksa. The Skanda purāna goes so far as to say that Gayā brāhmaṇas even if they are depraved in their conduct and are backward deserve to be invited at śräddha and are superior to brāhmanas who have mastered the Veda and Vedāngas. The Nirnayasindhu (III. p. 401 ) notes that, according to the Tristhalisetu of his grandfather, this provision holds good only in the case of the śrāddha at the Aksayya Vata in Gaya and nowhere else. In modern times the brāhmanas at Gayā used to require the performer of śrāddha while he was in the sacred Phalgu river to make a declaration about his wealth and demanded fees accordingly, thereby carrying to the letter the words of the Vāyupurāna. Many people returned from Gayā thoroughly dis illusioned and disgusted with the conduct of the brāhmanas at Gayā. In the Varāhapurāna 911 it is said that two verses were sung by the pitrs viz.Would such a blessed and intelli. gent man be born in our family who will offer pindas (i. e. śrāddha) to us without being stingy about wealth and who would bestow on brāhmaṇas with reference to us (i. e. for our bənefit) jewels, clothes, land, costly vehicles and all other kinds of wealth including water, when he has riches enough? Here lavish expenditure on all śrāddhas (not only at Gayā. śrāddha) appears to be strongly recommended. Devala prc</p>

<p>If no brāhmaṇa is available, then the Srāddhaviveka, Śrāddhatattva and other digests say that effigies of brāhmaṇas made with seven or nine darbhas (except in the case of a per former following the Sāmaveda who is not restricted as to the number of darbhas) should be got ready and śrāddha should be performed and afterwards the fee and other materials may be given later on to other brahmanas 912.</p>
<p>Rules were laid from very ancient times about the method of inviting brahma.nas. The A.p. Dh. S. states 912 that the performer should make a request to the brāhmaṇas on the previous day, that on the day of the śrāddha he should request a second time (saying &rsquo;today is the śrāddha day&rsquo;) and then he should address them a third time (with the words food is ready, come&rsquo;). Haradatta on the first of the three sutras explains that the request should be tomorrow there is a srāddha, you should do me the favour of being in the place of the Ahavaniya fire&rsquo; i. e. you should partake of the food that will be prepared. Manu III. 187 also says that the invitation should be on the previous day or on the day of the śrāddha</p>

The Matsyapurāņa 913 and Padma (Sșsti-khanda 9.85-88) provide that the person intending to perform a śrāddha should in an humble manner invite the brāhmanas on the previous day or (in the morning of the day of śrāddha, that he should touch the right knee (of the brāhmana to be invited) with the words &lsquo;you are given this invitation by me&rsquo; and repeat in their hearing the following observance you should be free from anger, should be intent on purity of body and mind) and should abstain from sexual intercourse and I, the performer of śrāddha, shall also act in the same way and that the pitrs in an aerial form wait upon the invited brāhmanas,&rsquo; The Brhan-nāradīya-purāna states that the invitation should be in the words &lsquo;O best men! You should do me a favour and accept the invitation for śrāddha.&rsquo; It is noteworthy that the Prajāpati-smrti (63) prescribes that one should invite brāhmaṇas for a śrāddha or sacrifice for gods in the evening of the previous day after uttering the verse &lsquo;akrodhanaiḥ &amp;c.&lsquo;914 The Skandapurāņa VI. 217. 37 says that the performer should address the brāhmana as follows: &lsquo;my father (is or will enter) into this your body and so will my grand-father; let him (the grand-father) come with his father and you should strictly observe the vrata&rsquo; (the rules). The invitation to the brāhmanas representing pitės is to be given with the sacred thread in the prācīnāvīta form and to those for Vaišvadevika in the yajñopavīta form.

<p>there is a conflict among smrtis and the medieval digests propose an option (vide Hemādri on śrāddha pp. 1154-1157). Manu III. 205 appears to lay down that the daiva brāhmana should be invited first (daivādyantam tad-iheta). Yama quoted by several digests 915 says that the performer should request in the evening of the previous day brāhmaṇas with the words You should all be free from exertions and should avoid passion and anger for the śrāddha in my house which is to be performed tomorrow,&rsquo; that the brāhmaṇas should reply &rsquo;let it be so if the night passes happily and without any mishap to us! digests (e. g. Śrāddhakriyākaumudi p. 81, Śrāddhatattva p. 194 and Nirnayasindhu III, p. 804) say that the verse &lsquo;saryāyāsa &amp;c,&rsquo; may be repeated when the invitation is given on the day previous to the day of śrāddha and the verse &lsquo;akrodhanaih&rsquo; when the invitation is given on the morning of the śrāddha day. The words of invitation differ according to different authorities, For example, according to the Mit. on Yāj. I. 225 the words are śrāddhe ksanah kriyatām.&rsquo;. Vide Sr. Pr. p. 106 also, Manu III. 187 and 191 show that the words &rsquo;nimantrana&rsquo; and &lsquo;amantrana&rsquo; are used as synonyms. In the Srāddhasūtra 916 of Kātyāyana the word &lsquo;āmantrana&rsquo; is used. But Pānini 917 (III. 3. 161) apparently makes a difference between the meanings of the two words and the Mahābhāsya explains that invitation is called &rsquo;nimantrana&rsquo; which if rejected (without proper cause) involves a fault or sin, while that invitation which one is free to reject (without incurring blame) is called &lsquo;āmantrana.&rsquo; There fore, it must be held that the few writers such as Kätyāyana who employ amantrana use it in a secondary sense. The invitation should be given by a performer himself or by his son,</p>

<p>brother or a pupil or a brāhmaṇa, but it should not be given through a person of another varna 918 or a woman or a child or person belonging to another gotra nor from a distance (Prajāpati 64). Pracetas provides that a brāhmana performer of grāddha when giving an invitation should touch the right knee, a ksatriya inviter the left knee of the invitee, a Vaisya inviter should hold both feet of the invitee and a sūdra should prostrate himself at the feet of the invitee (vide Sr. Pr. p. 106 and S. K. L. p. 47 ). The Markandeya (28. 35) states an exception that if, when a śrāddha rite is going on, brāhmaṇas or Vedic students or ascetics come by chance begging for food, the performer should make them pleased by falling at their feet and feed them (i.e. no formal invitation is necessary in these cases). Vide Visnupuräna III. 15. 12 for feeding uninvited ascetics. It is provided by Bhrgu quoted by Hemādri that the brāhmaṇas on accepting the invitation should pronounce the finely-worded and comprehensive Vedic benediction quoted below.919</p>
<p>Ušanas 919a provides that the performer should wash the floor of his house with water, cowdung it and cleanse the vessels on the day previous to the śrāddha and then give an invitation to the brāhmanas with the words tomorrow I am going to perform śräddha&rsquo;. The Varāhapurama and the Kurma also provide for this and for the washing of the clothes. Manu III. 206 also requires that the spot where śräddha is to be performed should be clean, secluded, cowdunged and should slope to the south.</p>

<p>mana who has been invited (to a śrāddha dinner) by a faultless performer should not refuse the invitation nor should he, after being invited (and having accepted the invitation), accept a gift of even (uncooked) food from another person. Manu III. 190 and Kūrmapurāna provide that if a brāhmana after receiving an invitation for a sacrifice to gods or manes according to śästra directions and after having accepted it violates the appoint ment, he incurs sin and becomes a hog 921 (in his next birth). This does not apply where he is unable to go on account of illness or other valid reason,</p>
<p>The smrtis laid down some strict and elaborate rules which were to be observed by the brāhmaṇas invited for śrāddha and by the performer himself. Many of the rules are applicable to both. Gaut. prescribes 922 that the brähmana who has partaken of śrāddha dinner should remain chaste (i. e. shun sexual inter course) that whole day, and if he has intercourse with a wife of the sūdra caste he thereby makes his own pitrs stay in the ordure of that wife. Vas. XI, 37 makes this rule applicable both to the performer and the invited brāhmaṇa and as regards wives of all varņas. Manu III. 188 provides that the brāhmana invited to dine at a sacrifice in honour of pitrs and the per former of the śrāddha should remain controlled (i. e. chaste and free from anger and passion) and should not study the Veda (except japa). Yāj. I. 225 (latter half) briefly puts the matter by saying &rsquo;they should be controlled as to their bodies, speech and thoughts&rsquo;. The Matsyapurana 923 prescribes that both the performer of śrāddha and the brāhmana invited to dine at it should avoid dining again (after the śrāddha dinner), journey, going in a conveyance, exertions, sexual intercourse, study of the Veda, quarrel and sleeping by day. Similar rules to observe continence are laid down for both on the day of śrāddha if invitation be given on the morning of the day of</p>

<p>śrāddha and also on the previous day if invitation be given on the day previous to the grāddha day. Vide Visnu Dh. S. 69. 2-4, The Mit, on Yāj. I. 79 appears to strike a dissenting note about sexual intercourse with one&rsquo;s wife during the days from the 5th to the 16th; while most other medieval writers such as Hemādri (śr. pp. 1006-7) and Śr. P. p. 111 are opposed to this view. The Srāddhasūtra 924 of Kātyāyana provides that the performer should, from the time of giving invitation to the time when the brāhmaṇas sip water (i. e. performācamana after śrāddha dinner), remain pure, free from anger, hurry, negligence, should speak the truth and should shun a journey, sexual intercourse, hard work and study of the Veda and control speech (should remain mostly silent) and the brāhmanas invited should observe the same rules. Aušanasa (Jiv. vol. I. pp. 526-527) contains verses very similar in import to Kātyāyana. The Brahmapurāņa (220. 106-108), Mārkandeya (28. 31-33) and Anušāsana 125.24 have identical verses 925 and Vāyu 79.60-61 are very similar in import. Laghu-Sankha 29, Laghu-Hārīta 75 and Likhita 60 have the same verse requiring the invited brahmanas to avoid eight matters, viz. dining again, journey, carrying loads, Vedic study, sexual intercourse, making gifts, accepting gifts, performing homa, while Prajāpati 92 substi tutes the brushing of the teeth (with a twig), tāmbula, bath after applying oil to the body, and fast for the first four of the above eight. The Anušāsanaparva (90. 12-13) and Padma (Pātālakhanda 101. 94-95) also contain a list of actions that should be avoided. Briefly put, the following were the obser vances for both inviter and invitee, viz. avoidance of sexual intercourse, dining again, falsehood, hurry, vedic study, heavy work, gambling, carrying burdens, giving gifts and acceptance of gifts, theft, journey, sleep by day, quarrels; the performer alone was to abstain from eating tambūla, shaving, applying oil to the body, brushing the teeth with a twig; while the bräh.</p>

<p>mana invited was (alone) to observe the following, viz. not absenting oneself after accepting an invitation, making no delay when called for dinner (vide Srāddhakalikā folio 4b and 5a and Pitr-bhakti on śrāddha 926 ).</p>
<p>Elaborate provisions are made from ancient times about the substances and utensils proper for being used at srāddha and about those that should not be used therein. Ap. Dh. 927 S. remarks: the materials in śrāddha are sesamum, māsas, rice, yavas (barley ), water, roots and fruits; but the pitrs are extremely gratified by food that is mixed with clarified butter and for a very long time; so also they are gratified by wealth that is obtained lawfully and is bestowed on worthy persons&rsquo;. Manu III. 267 ( Vāyu 83.3) is to the same effect as Ap. Dh. S. Yāj. I. 258 is content to say that food which is fit to be offered in sacrifices (havisya) should be served. Manu III, 257 explains that food eaten by hermits in the forest, (cow&rsquo;s) milk, soma juice, meat that is not prepared with spices (or that is free from a bad smell), rock salt are by their very nature havis (sacrificial food). According to Gaut. 27. 11 the sacrificial food (havis) comprises boiled rice, food obtained by begging, ground barley (after being baked or fried), grain separated from husk, barley gruel, vege tables, milk, curds, clarified butter, roots, fruits and water. 928 Other smrtis and digests very much elaborated these brief indications in the early works. The three kinds of wealth (viz. śukla, sabala and krsna ) and the several lawful or uncondemned means of acquiring wealth have been described already in H. of Dh. vol. II. pp. 130 ff. The Mārkandeya (29. 14-15) condemns the use in śrāddhas of wealth that is obtained by taking bribes or from a patita (one guilty of a grave sin), that springs from bride-price or that is declared to be unlawful or is obtained by saying to another &lsquo;give me for the sake of a śrāddha to be offered to my father&rsquo; (q. by Sm.C. on</p>

The Skandapurāna emphasizes that at a śrāddha purity (suddhi) must be specially secured in seven matters viz. the body of the performer), the materials, the wife, the place (where śrāddha is to be performed), the mind, the mantras and brāhmanas.929 Manu III. 235 (= Vas, 11.35) states: three are the sanctifying things in a śrāddha, viz. a daughter&rsquo;s son, a Nepal blanket and sesamum grains and three are commended in śrāddha viz, cleanliness, freedom from anger and absence of hurry.929a Pracetas mentions several kinds of oorn that are commended as food in grāddha. Manu III, 255 summarises that in śrāddha the riches (i. e. the most im portant matters) are afternoon, darbhas, proper cleansing of the place (or house) for śrāddha, sesame, generous expense (on food &amp;c.), seasoning food, eminent brāhmanas,</p>
<p>The Mārkandeya-purāņa says that several kinds of corn yielding plants (some due to tillage in villages and some growing wild) were produced by Brahmā when he milked the earth for famished people, while Brahmavaivarta (q. by Hemādri on śräddha p. 537) affirms that when a few particles fell down on the earth while Indra drank. Soma, from them arose such corn as śyāmāka, wheat, yava, mudga and red paddy and as they were produced from soma they were like nectar to the pitřs and food prepared from these should be offered to pitrs. The Mārkandeya speaks of seven kinds of grāmya corn and seven kinds of wild (āranya) corn. Prajāpati 119 recommends the use of eight kinds of corn, viz. nivära, māşa, mudga, wheat, paddy, yava, grain and sesamum, The Matsya (q. by Hemādri on śrāddha p. 538) narrates that when the Sun drank nectar some drops fell down from which arose the several kinds of</p>

<p>paddy, midga, sugarcane and that therefore sugar is sacred and may be employed in sacrifices to gods and manes. The Mārkandeya 930 mentions several kinds of corn that may be employed for śrāddha food. The Brahma-purāna 220. 154 155, Vayu 82. 3, Visnupurana III. 16. 5-6, Vispu, Dh. S., 931 Brahmānda II, 7. 143-152 and III. 14. contain similar lists of different kinds of corn that may be used in śrāddhas. The Vāyupurāņa (80. 42-48) mentions various desirable eatables prepared from corn of various kinds, sugar and clarified butter and milk..932</p>
<p>Certain kinds of corn and cereals were forbidden. For example, the Matsya-purana and Padma (Srstikhanda, chap. 9. 62-66 )933 declare that masüra, linseed, nispāva, rājamāsa, kusumbhika, kodrava, udāra, gram, kapittha, madhūka and linseed are forbidden. Visnu Dh. S. 79.18 provides that the performer should avoid the bean called rājamāsa, masüra, stale food and salt manufactured from seawater. The Sat-trimsa nmata 934 forbids the use in śrāddha of all kinds of cereals covered with dark. husk except sesamum, mudga and māşa.</p>

<p>What milk and water to be used</p>
<p>415</p>
<p>From considerations of space this matter cannot be pursued further. The Mit, on Yāj. I. 240 puts together a long list of allowed and of condemned kinds of grains and other articles.</p>
<p>What milk should be ordinarily partaken of and what should be avoided has been dealt with in H. of Dh, vol. II, pp. 782-783. A few words are added here. Manu III, 271 and Yāj. I. 258 provide that if cow&rsquo;s milk or rice cooked therein (called pāyasa) is offered in srāddha the pitrs are satisfied for one year. Vāyu 78. 17, Brahma 935 220.169, Märkandeya 32,17-19, Vişnupurāna III.16.11 forbid the use in a śrāddha of the milk of a she-buffalo, of a camari or female deer, of sheep or ewes, of she camels, of human females and of all animals with one hoof and the use of the curds and clarified butter prepared from such milk. But ghee prepared from buftalo milk was allowed by Sumantu and Devala (q. by Hemādri on śrāddha p. 572).</p>
<p>The Märkandeyapurāna 936 (29.15-17), Vāyu (78.16) and Vişnupurāpa (III, 16.10) lay down that the water to be employed in sraddha must not have a bad smell, must not be foamy, or taken from a puddle or a small reservoir which cannot slake the thirst of a cow, must not have been brought overnight, must not be taken from a reservoir not dedicated to all or from a trough or the like meant for beasts.</p>
<p>Several rules are laid down about the fruits, roots and vegetables recommended or condemned for use in srāddha. For example, the Brahma-purāņa (220.156-158 ) enumerates several kinds of fruits such as mangoes, bilva, pomegranate, cocoanut, dates, grapes, as fit to be given in śräddha. Vide Sankha 14.22-23 also. Vāyu (78.11-15 ) states936c that garlic, leeks and onions, other things that are of bad odour or taste</p>

<p>and all exudation from trees not permitted by the Veda and salt gathered from saltish earth, should be avoided in śrāddha. The Vişnudharmasūtra 937 (79.17) contains a long list of fruits, bulbs and vegetables that were not to be employed in sraddha. The Rāmāyāna states 938 that Rāma when an exile in the Dandaka forest gratified his pitys by offering the fruits of inguda, badara, and bilva trees and generalises that deities are offered that food which is partaken of by a person (who is a devotee of That deity). From considerations of space detailed references to the smộtis and purāņas are passed over. The Smộtyarthasära pp. 52-53, Srāddhaviveka (pp. 43-47 ) of Rudradhara and other digests collect in one place the foods, vegetables, fruits and roots that are allowed to be offered in śrāddha and that are condemned in sraddha. Manufactured salt was forbidden, but natural salt from a lake (called saindhava) was allowed. Salt was not to be served directly (as Visnudharmasūtra 79.12 says) but when put in while cooking vegetables it was not prohibited. There was a difference of opinion about the employment of asafoetida (vide Hemādri on Srāddha p. 565). The Visnudharmasutra (79.5-6) provides that flowers having a strong (or nasty) odour or no odour at all, the blossoms of thorny plants and red flowers should not be given, but one may give white and sweet-smell ing flowers even though they are taken from thorny plants and flowers though red in colour may be taken from aquatic plants. Sankha (14. 15-16) is to the same effect (q. by Hemādri p. 684). Väyu (75. 33-35) is to the same effect and adds that the flowers called Japā, Bhandi, Rūpikā (of arka plant), Kurantaka should be avoided in sraddha. The Brahmapurana (220.162 165 ) specifies the several kinds of flowers that may be offered in śrāddha such as jāti, campaka, mallikā, mango blossom, tulasi, tagara, ketaki and various kinds of lotuses ( white, blue and red &amp;c.). The Smộtyarthasāra includes tulasi among things to be avoided in śrāddha. The Sm. O. notes this and remarks</p>

<p>Kušas are required in srāddha. Vide H, of Dh. vol. II. p.657 for general remarks on kusas. A few words may be added here. The Sat. Br. VII, 2.3.2 states that the waters that loathed Vrtra went out to waterless deserts and became bushes of darbhas 939. Similarly, Ašv. Gr. III. 2.2 summarizes a Brāh mana text stating that darbhas are the essence of waters and herbs (apam va esa osadhinām raso yad-darbhah). Prajapati (verse 98 ) 9394 provides that darbhas should be gathered from a pure spot in the morning by a brāhmaṇa, should have mantras repeated over them, should be greenish in colour, should be as long as a cow&rsquo;s ear and then they are holy. The Gobhila gr. (1. 5. 16-17) states the barhis consists of kuģa grass cut off at the points at which the blades diverge from the main stalk and that the blades should be cut off near the roots at the rites meant for the Fathers&rsquo;. Daksa (II, 33 and 35) provides that the second part of the day (divided into eight parts) is the proper time for collecting fuelsticks, flowers and kusas. The Gobhilasmrti (I. 20-21) says 940 that the darbhas used in sacrifices are gree nish, those to be used in Pākayajñas should be yellowish, those in rites for the pitrs must be taken out from the roots and those that are to be used in Vaišvadeva should be dark-pale, and that</p>

<p>greenish darbhas together with ends uncut, that are smooth and well nourished, one aratni in length and touched with that part of the hand called pitrtirtha are pure, The Padmapurāņa (Srstikhanda 11.92 ) and Skanda VII1. 205.16 state that kuģas and black sesamum spring from the body of Visnu and the Vispudharmottara I. 139.12 says that tilas and darbhas sprang from the perspiration and hair of Visnu in the Boar incarna tion. The Matsya ( 22.89 ) says the same.</p>
<p>The Garuda 941 (Pretakhanda 2.21-22) states that all the three gods dwell in kusa grass viz. Brahmā at its root, Visnu in the middle and Sankara at the end and that brāhmaṇas, mantras, kuśas, fire, tulası leaf&ndash;these do not become nirmālya (stale and so unfit to be used again ) even when the same are employed again and again. But an exception is made by Gobhila 942 that those darbhas which are spread on the ground for placing pindas on them or that are used in tarpana and those that are held in the hand while a man is answering the calls of nature should be given up (and not used again). The Visņu Dh, S. 79.2 and Väyu 75.41 provide that if kušas are not avail able, kāśa grass or Dūrvā may be substituted. The Skanda purāna VII (Prabhāsakhanda ) part 1.206.17 says that straight darbhas are used in giving gifts, at baths, in japa, homa, dinner and worship of gods, but they are double-folded when used in rites for pitrs. The Skanda VII. 1. 205,16 provides that the top of darbhas is for divine rites, while darbha with the root and tip is meant for paityka rites. This is based on the Sat. Br. II. 4. 2.17 which states that the top of the darbha belongs to gods, the middle to men and the root part to the fathers,</p>
<p>Great importance was attached to the use of tila (sesamum) in śräddha. The Jaiminigshya II.1 states that the whole house should have sesamum grains scattered about in it. Baud. Dh. S. II. 8,8 provides that when the invited brahmanas come they should be given water mixed with sesame. The Baud. gr. II. 11.64 provides that sesamum grains are holy in sraddha for making gifts of them or as part of food or for being mixed in</p>

<p>water. The Prajapatismrti speaks 943 of four kinds of tilas viz. white, black, very black and jartilas and states that each succeeding one gives greater gratification to the pitrs than each preceding one. The Tai.s.V. 4.3.2 refers tojartilas and Jai. X.8.7 holds a discussion thereon. The Naradapurana (purvardha 28.36) 944 provides that the performer of śrāddha should scatter tilas in the midst of the brāhmaṇas invited and at the doors with the mantra &lsquo;apahatā&rsquo; (may the asuras and evil spirits that sit on the altar be struck and run away). Yaj. I. 234 also recommends this mantra ( which is Vāj. S. II. 29). The Kūrma purana (II. 22.18) states that sesame should be scattered all round and a goat should be tied near the spot, since srāddha polluted by asuras becomes purified by sesame and a goat. The Visnupurāna (III. 16.14) prescribes that by tilas scattered on the ground one should ward off evil spirits (Yātudhāna ). The Garudapurana 945 ( Pretakhanda 2. 16 ) makes Srikrsna say &ldquo;tilas have sprung from the perspiration on my body and are holy; asuras, dānavas and daityas run away on account of tilas.&rsquo; The Anusāsana-parva (90.22 ) says that yātudhānas and goblins snatch away the havis when the srāddha is offered without tilas. The Krtyaratnākara (p. 540 ) quotes a verse as follows: &lsquo;he who applies as unguent tilas, who bathes with water in which tilas are mixed, offers tilas into fire, makes gifts of tilas, eats tilas and who grows tilas-these six never sink (i. e. are not unlucky nor in trouble ).</p>
<p>A great deal is said about the vessels to be used in offering arghya (water for honouring the invited brāhmaṇas and pipdas), for cooking śrāddha food, for dining and for serving. The Śrāddhasūtra of Kātyāyana 946 provides that the arghya water</p>

<p>The conclusion arrived at by Jai. X. 8.7 is that the passage about जतिलs is an अर्थवाद for praising पयोहोम. The स्मृतिच. (श्राद्ध) p. 433 says जतिलास्तु तिलाः प्रोक्ताः कृष्णवर्णा वने भवा इति सत्यवतेनाभिधानात्.</p>

The Vispu Dh. S. (179. 14-15) provides that the performer should employ metallic vessels, particularly vessels made of silver. The Mārkandeya (31.65) and Väyu (74.3) state that in a vessel of silver the (ancient) pitrs milked svadhā and hence a silver vessel is highly desired by pitrs and brings de light to them. Yăj. I. 237 also specially recommends silver vessels. The Vayu (74. 1-2), Matsya (17. 19-22), Brahmānda (Upodghāta 11. 1-2) and Padma (Srstikhanda 9. 147-150) state that vessels of gold, silver or copper are the (proper) ones for pitrs; that even the talk about silver or the sight or gift of silver gives inexhaustible results to pitrs in heaven, that vessels to be used for arghya, for pipda and for the food to be offered should be preferably of silver and that in rites for gods a silver vessel is not auspicious. Atri (q. by Sm. C. II, p. 464) says that in rites for the gods and pitrs, vessels of gold and silver should be respectively employed and in default of these vessels of other metals (such as copper, bell-metal) should be used (as stated by Visnu Dh. S. 79.22 and 24). The Padma provides 947 that the vessels may be of sacrificial wood or of palāśa or of silver or made from a sea product (such as conch shell) and that since silver was produced from the eye of Siva, it is a great favourite with pitrs. Prajāpati (111) provides that the three piņdas should be cast in a vessel of gold or silver or copper or bell metal or of rhinoceros horn but not in earthenware or a wooden vessel, that (verse 112) the cooking vessels should be of copper or of any metal, but an earthen vessel baked in fire and immersed in water is the best (for cooking), that food cooked in an iron vessel is like crow&rsquo;s flesh, that (115) the vessels to be used for taking food by the brāhmaṇas should be made of gold, silver or of an alloy of five metals or they may take their food in patrāvali (i. o. leaves stitched together); vide also Matsya</p>

Acamana should be performed with water from a copper vessel. Atri (153) prescribes that no food should be served from an iron vessel, if so served the food is like ordure to the diner and the server goes to hell.

<p>Visnu Dh, S. 79. 11 provides that for unguents (anulepana) to be applied to the bodies of the invited brāhmaṇas, sandal wood, saffron, camphor, aguru, padmaka may be used. The Brahmapurāņa (220. 165-166) mentions kustha, jatā-mänsi, nutmeg, uśīra, mustā and some others as proper perfumed articles to be used at śräddhas.</p>
<p>It has already been seen at pp. 413-14 what kinds of food were recommended or condemned for śrāddha. The Matsyapurāņa 948 states that food containing milk and curds and clarified butter from cow&rsquo;s milk mixed with sugar gives satisfaction to all pitrs for one month and that whatever food, whether cow&rsquo;s milk or ghee or rice cooked in milk, is mixed with honey, yields inexhaustible results. The Brahmapurāpa also ( 220. 182-184) provides that such eatables as are sweet and oily and are slightly sour and pungent should be served in śräddha and one should shun eatables that are very sour or very saltish or very pungent, since they are ūsura (fit for asuras). Great emphasis was laid on serving preparations of food made from māşa</p>

C. quotes a smrti text saying that a śrāddha in which no māsa preparation is offered is as good as not performed.</p>
<p>The greatest divergence has prevailed about the employ ment of flesh at śrāddhas among writers from the earliest times. The subject of flesh-eating in general has been discussed at great length in the History of Dharmaśāstra, vol. II, pp. 772-782. A few remarks about flesh in relation to śrāddha will not be out of place here. The Ap. Dh. S. prescribes 950 that the obli gatory śrāddha (to be performed every month) must contain food mixed with fat, the best course (for supplying fat) is to employ clarified butter and flesh; on failure of these two, sesa mum oil and vegetables may be employed. The same sūtra also provides 951 that the pitrs are gratified for a year by the offering of cow&rsquo;s flesh in a śrāddha, that by the flesh of a buffalo the gratification of pitrs extends to more than a year, that this rule extends to the flesh of wild animals (like hares) and village (or domesticated) animals (like goats) that are declared to be fit for being sacrificed, that the gratification of pitrs extends to endless time if the flesh of a rhinoceros is offered to brāhmaṇas seated on rhinoceros skin, so also by the flesh of the</p>

The Kūrmapurāņa II. 22.75 provides that the brahmana who is employed for the performance of a śräddha and does not eat flesh offered therein becomes a beast for 21 births. Manu III. 257 states that the following are said to be proper offerings in a śrāddha by their very nature viz. food (prepared from nīvāra grain and the like) fit for a forest hermit, milk, soma juice, flesh that does not emit foul smell and unmanufactured salt. An ascetic was ordinarly required not to partake of flesh; but Vasistha insisted on his partaking of it when invited at a śrāddha.</p>

<p>honey, of food fit for hermits (wild corn such as nīvāra), the flesh of a red goat, of Mahāśāka (i. e. Kālašāka), and the flesh of Värdhrīnasa&ndash;these secure inexhaustible fruit. There is some divergence of views among the several works. For example, Manu III. 267 and 271, Katyāyana (in srāddhasūtra 7 ) appear to hold that by offering food prepared from village corn (such as rice, māsa &amp; c.) or wild eatables (such as nīvāra or fruits and roots) the gratification is only for one month and the flesh of Vārdhrinasa produces gratification for twelve years only (and not for all time ). Visnu Dh, S. 80.10 and Manu III. 270 bring in buffalo flesh and tortoise flesh as giving gratification for ten and eleven month respec tively. Hemādri (on śräddha p. 590 ) 953 is careful to point out that these words about the duration of time are not to be taken literally but what is really intended is to convey greater and greater gratification of the pitrs according to the kind of flesh offered. Pulastya quoted by the Mit. and Aparārka p. 555 provides that a brāhmaṇa should generally or mainly offer at a śrāddha hermit&rsquo;s food, a ksatriya or a vaisya should offer flesh, a śūdra should offer honey and all varnas may offer anything else (except these three) which is not forbidden. 954 Whoever may be the offerer, the eater at a śrāddha dinner was to be a brāhmaṇa alone and so it follows that brāhmaṇas invited to a śrāddha by a kşatriya or vaisya had to eat flesh. Yet it is remarkable that even the Mitākṣarā and the Kalpataru written about 1100-1120 A. D. do not expressly say that in the Kali age flesh-eating at śrāddha is totally prohibited at least for brāhmaṇas. It has been shown already (H. of Dh. vol. III, pp. 775-776) that even when animal sacrifices were the order of the day in the Rgveda and the Brāhmaṇas there was an undercurrent of thought that the offerings of fuel-sticks or of boiled rice when made with heart felt devotion to the gods were as good as flesh offerings for</p>

<p>securing their favour. In course of time that conception grew 361 onger and stronger, so much so that Manu (V. 27-44 and V.46-47) and Vasistha appear to be in two minds (vide H. of Dh. vol. II pp. 778–780). Gradually the offering of flesh in Madhuparka and in śrāddhas came to be totally condemned in works of the 12th and 13th centuries and onwards as a matter prohibited in the Kali age (Varātithipitrbhyasca pašūpākaranakriya). (Vide H. of Dh, vol. III pp. 945-946 and p. 964). Now except among the brāhmanas (in Northern India ) who have no objection to include fish in diet as permissible to them no brāhmana offers flesh in śrāddha, The usage of Northern India would be in accordance with the view set out in Brhannāradiya-purāna that one should offer honey, flesh and other things according to the usage of the country, as explained by the Přthvicandrodaya.</p>
<p>Manu ( V.11-18) contains long lists of animals, birds and fishes whose flesh was not to be eaten even by those who were flesh-eaters.</p>
<p>If a person is destitute, some of the Purāṇas such as the Visnu (III. 4.24-30) and the Varāha (13,53-58) mercifully provide in identical 955 verses that instead of entertaining brāhmanas with a sumptuous dinner or flesh the poor man may offer only un cooked corn, or some vegetables growing wildly or some slight daksinā if he cannot offer even uncooked food or vegetables, or he may offer a few grains of sesamum (7 or 8 ) to a brāhmana with water in his folded hands, or grass to a cow enough for one day and if he cannot afford even any one of these, then he may repair to a thicket of trees, raise his arms so that his armpits are exposed and loudly address the guardians of the worlds such as the Sun in the following words: &lsquo;I have neither wealth nor money nor anything else fit to be offered by way of śrāddha; I bow to my pitrs; may the pitřs be satisfied by my devotion; I have stretched these arms in space!&rsquo; (lit, the path of the wind).</p>

<p>It is now time to describe the procedure of the Pārvaņa Sraddha. 955a which is the pattern or norm (prakrti) of the other śrāddhas 956 (even including the Aştakās). Here one meets with great divergences of views even from the times of the sūtras up to modern times. Though the main items and stages in the rite of śrāddha are generally the same, there is variation in the mantras, the details and sometimes in the order of the several items. Kātyāyana lays down that every man has to follow his own sūtra as to the use of the word &lsquo;svāhā&rsquo; or the words &lsquo;svadhā namah&rsquo;, as to wearing the sacred thread in the yajñopavita or prācīnāvita way and as to the number of āhutis 957</p>
<p>It would be very interesting first to find out the vestiges of the sacrifice to the fathers in the most ancient Vedic texts. The Tai, S. (I. 8. 5. 1-2) deals 958 with the Mahāpitryajña per</p>
<p>955 a. Terms already explained such as Pārvana&rsquo; and &lsquo;Ekoddista! are not explained again, Vide n. 855above for those two words. Sraddha on amavasya, is obligatory (nitya) as laid down by Gaut. 15.1q. in note 935 above, while the srāddhas performed on the other tithis of the dark half of a month are kāmya.</p>

<p>He says &rsquo;to Soma drunk by the pitrs, svadhāl Adoration!&rsquo; He says to Agni, the carrier of kavya, svadhā! Adoration ! (Thereby ) he pleases the fire that pertains to the pitrs. He offers (into fire ) three oblations; he puts down (on the darbhas spread on the ground) three pindas. (These) thus come to six in number. Six indeed are the seasons. He (thereby) pleases the seasons. The seasons are indeed the shining (or divine) pitrs&hellip;&hellip;The darbha grass is cut with one stroke; the pitrs have as it were (passed away) once for ever. He puts down thrice (the pindas). The pitrs are indeed in the third world from here. He (thereby) pleases them. He (the performer) turns his face away to the north from the south), for the Fathers are shy. He remains with his face turned away till the steam (of the boiled rice of the pindas) ceases to rise, for the Fathers have the steam of rice as their share; he should simply gmell (the pindas). That as if does not amount to eating or non-eating. The pitřs when departing (from the śrāddha rite) take away or grant a valiant son. He cuts off the fringe (of a garment to place it on the pindas), for the share of Fathers is taking away (what is offered). He (thereby) allots their proper share to the pitrs (and dismisses them). When the performer) is in the latter part of life (i. e, over 50 years of age) he cuts off hair (from his chest instead of presenting a daśa). At that time he is nearer to the pitrs (when above 50 years of age). He offers adoration, because adoration (namaskāra) is dear to the pitrs. Adoration to you, O Fathers, for vigour; adoration to you, O fathers, for life; adoration to you, O fathers, for svadhū; adoration to you, O fathers, for ardour; adoration, O fathers, for the terri ble! O fathers! here is adoration to you. This (pindapitryajña) is indeed a sacrifice of men (i. e. sacrifice to departed men) and other sacrifices belong to the gods.” In the Tai. Br. I. 4. 10 the Pitryajña performed in sākamelha is praised (in 2) and further on it is said that Rtus (seasons) are pitrs and they offered pitryajña to Prajāpati, their father. This passage gupports the provision made in Manu and some of the digests that the Rtus are to be identified with pitrs and obeisance is to be made to them. %0</p>

<p>Pindapitryajña in sat. Br.</p>

<p>The Sat. Br. (II. 4. 2) contains the following somewhat fuller account of the Pinda-pitry ajña, omitting legendary or other irrelevant matters :-When the moon is not seen either in the east or in the west, then he (the performer of the Darsa sacrifice) presents food to the Fathers in each month &hellip;&hellip; He presents it in the afternoon. The forenoon indeed belongs to the gods; the midday to men; and the afternoon to the Fathers; therefore he presents (food to the Fathers) in the afternoon. While seated behind the Gārhapatya fire with his face turned towards the south and the sacred thread on his right shoulder he takes that material (for the offering from the cart). There upon he rises from thence and threshes the rice while standing north of the Dakşiņa fire and facing the south. Only once does he clean the rice, for it is once for all that the fathers have passed away. He then boils it. While it stands on the Dakşiņa fire) he pours some clarified butter on it. After remov ing it (from the fire) he offers to the gods two oblations in the fire &hellip;&hellip; Here he is engaged in a sacrifice to the Fathers; hence he thereby propitiates the gods and being permitted by the gods, he presents that food to the Fathers. He offers to both Agni and Soma &hellip; He offers with the formula To Agni, the carrier of kavya (what is offered to the Manes), svāhā!&rsquo;, &lsquo;To Soma accompanied by the Fathers, svāhā!&rsquo; (Vāj. S. II 29). He then puts the pot-ladle (mekşana) on the fire, that being in lieu of the Svistakřt. Thereafter he draws (with the sphya, the wooden sword) one line south of the Dakşiņa fire, that being in lieu of the altar. He then lays down a firebrand at the further (south) end of the line, For, were he to present that food to the Fathers without having laid down a firebrand, the Asuras and Rākşasas would certainly tamper with it. &hellip; He lays it down with the text &lsquo;whatsoever Asuras roam about being attracted by the svadhā (offering to Fathers), assuming various shapes, be they large-bodied or small-bodied, may Agni expel them from this world (Vāj. S. II, 30)&hellip; He then takes the water jar and makes the Fathers wash (their hands) merely saying &lsquo;N. N., wash thyself&rsquo; (naming) the sacrificer&rsquo;s father; &lsquo;N. N. wash thy self (naming the sacrificer&rsquo;s) grandfather; &lsquo;N. N., wash thyself</p>

<p>(naming) the sacrificer&rsquo;s great-grandfather. As one would pour out water (for a guest) when he is about to take food, so in this case. Now those (stalks of sacrificial grass) are severed with one stroke and cut off near the root; the top belongs to the gods, the middle part to men and the root part (of darbhas) to the fathers. Therefore they are cut off near the roots &hellip;&hellip; He spreads them along with the line with their tops towards the south. Thereon he presents (to the fathers the three round cakes of rice). He presents thus :- for the gods they offer thus: for men they ladle out; and in the case of the fathers they do in this very way; therefore he presents (the cakes to the fathers) thus. With &lsquo;N. N., this for thee!&rsquo; he presents one cake to the sacrificer&rsquo;s father. Some add &lsquo;for those that come after thee&rsquo;, but let him not say this, since he himself is one of those to whom it would be offered in common. Let him therefore merely say &lsquo;N, N., this for thee!&rsquo; as to the sacrificer&rsquo;s father; &lsquo;N. N., this for thee&rsquo; as to his grandfather; &lsquo;N. N., this for thee&rsquo; as to his great grandfather&hellip;He then mutters &lsquo;Here, O fathers, regale your selves; like bulls come hither each to his own share!&rsquo; (Vāj. S. II, 31). Whereby he says &lsquo;Eat each his own share&rsquo;. He then turns round to the left so as to face the opposite (north) side ; for the fathers are far away from men; and thereby he also is far away (from the fathers). &lsquo;Let him remain (standing with bated breath) until his breath fail&rsquo; say some; &lsquo;for thus far extends the vital energy&rsquo;. However, having remained so far a moment-he again turns round (to the right) and mutters &rsquo;the Fathers have regaled themselves; like bulls they have come each to his own share&rsquo; (Vāj. S. II, 31); whereby what he says is &rsquo;they have eaten each his own share&rsquo;. Thereupon he takes the water jar and makes them wash themselves (by pouring water on the pipdas), merely saying &lsquo;N. N., wash thyself&rsquo; (naming) the sacrificer&rsquo;s father; &lsquo;N. N. wash thy self&rsquo; (naming) his grandfather; &lsquo;N. N., wash thyself&rsquo; (naming) his paternal great-grandfather. Even as one would pour out (water for a guest). When he has taken his meal, so it is here. He then pulls down the tuck (of the sacrificer&rsquo;s garment) and performs obeisance. The tuck is sacred to the Fathers; therefore he performs obeisance to them after pulling down the tuck, &hellip; Six times he performs obeisance, for there are six seasons and the fathers are the seasons. He mutters &lsquo;Give us houses, O fathers&rsquo; for the fathers are the rulers of houses; and this is the prayer for blessing at this sacrificial performance. After the</p>

<p>monthly śräddha (māsi-śräddha) is the prakrti of Astakā and other srāddhas in which three ancestors are to be invoked. It is as follows: Now then at a Pārvana-śrāddha, or at a śrāddha celebrated for securing some desired object, or at an Abhyu dayika-śrāddha or at an Ekoddistaśräddha, the performer causes to sit down brāhmaṇas who are endowed with learning, moral character and proper conduct or who are endowed with ( at least) one of these three characteristics ), who have been invited already in proper time, who have taken a bath, whose feet are washed (by the performer) and who have sipped water (taken ācamana), as representatives of (or equal to) the Fathers, with their faces turned to the north, one for each of the Fathers, or two for each or three for each. The larger the number of brāhmaṇas invited the greater is the fruit or reward. But in no case (should he invite ) only one for all (the Fathers ); or he may invite only one brāhmaṇa except at the first śrāddha 967. By the exposition of the Pindapitryajña the rules for the pārvana-śrāddha have been declared. Having given water (into the hands of the invited brāhmaṇa or brāhmaṇas after they sit down) and double-folded darbha blades as a seat (on which the darbhas are to be kept), having again given water to them and having poured water into three vessels of metal (silver &amp;c.), of stone and of earthenware or into three vessels made of the same substance (out of these three) which are covered over with darbha blades and having recited (over the water in the vessels ) the verse &lsquo;sanno &amp;c.&rsquo; (Rg.

<p>The rules about Pindapitryañja have been set forth in Āsv. Sr. S. II. 6. Nārāyana notes (on Āśv. gr. IV. 7.2) that Āśvalāyana treats of only the procedure relating to the rite for pitrs and that he does not at all refer to the dinner given to daiva or Vaišvadeva brāhmanas at the time of sraddha. It is therefore possible that feeding daiva brahmanas was added to the ancient ritual, though it must be said that Manu III. 125, Yaj. I. 224-28 and Vas. XI. 27 prescribe such feeding. Dr. Caland (in &lsquo;Ahnencult p. 161 ) asserts that he can prove that the detail of feeding daiva brahmanas spread from the Srāddhasūtra of Katyāyana to the other sutras and he relies on the fact that Kätyāyana (in Kandikā 2) prescribes that the viśve devāh should be invoked with the verse . Visve devāsa āgata&rsquo; and the performer should mutter the verse visve devāh srnutemam&rsquo; which are respectively Vaj. S. VII. 34 and XXXIII. 53. But Dr. Caland tries to prove too much. The first verse occurs twice in the Rg. (II. 41. 13 and VI 52.7) and the second occurs in Rg. VI. 52. 13, Tai. S. II. 4. 14. 5. They are not found only in the Vaj. S. as Dr. Caland seems to have thought. It is possible that other works took over those mantras from the Rgveda or the Tai. S. It may also be noted that Yāj. I. 229 mentions only &lsquo;Visve devāsa&rsquo; and specifies that it is a rk (and not a mantra or yajus). So Yaj. at least does not appear to have borrowed the prescriptions of Katyayana. It is not necessary to examine the other arguments.</p>

<p>Svadha&rsquo; or he should say &lsquo;Om! Svadhā !&rsquo; (and they should reply</p>
<p>Om! Svadhā!), 980a</p>
<p>From considerations of space it is impossible to set out all the differences among the several grhyasūtras of the Rgveda, of the Taittiriya sākhā (viz. Baudhāyana, Āp., Hir., Bharadvāja and Vaikhānasa), of the Vājasaneya sākhā (such as Srāddhasūtra of Kātyāyana), of the Sāmaveda (such as Gobhila and Khādira) and of the Atharvaveda (being Kausika sūtra). A few matters may be set out by way of illustration. The Āp. gr. (21. 3-4)981 states that after the brāhmaṇas are invited for śrāddha dinner) from the food prepared for the dinner a portion is taken out in a vessel and therefrom seven āhutis are cast into the fire with the seven mantras beginning with &lsquo;yan me mātā&rsquo; (in Āp. M. P. II. 19, 1-7), the first two for the father, the next two for the grand-father, next two for the great-grand-father and the 7th to pitrs in general with svāhā (but without naming any one) and then six oblations of clarified butter are offered with the six formulas beginning with &lsquo;svāhā pitre&rsquo; (Ap. M. P. II. 19, 8-13). Thus the agnaukarana in Ap. consists of two parts viz, āhutis of food and of clarified butter, while in Asv. it is made only with food. Then the performer should touch all food (cooked food and the remainder of what is employed for offering into fire ) with the three mantras &ldquo;esa te tata madhumān&rsquo; (Ap. M. P. II. 19. 14-16), he should make the brāhmaṇas touch the food served to each with the Yajus formula &rsquo;the earth is thy vessel&rsquo; (Ap. M. P. 2. 20. 1) quoted in n. 992 below.</p>
<p>Ap. gr. prescribes the mantra, &lsquo;putrān pautrān&rsquo; (Ap. M. P. II. 20. 24) for moistening the pindas, while Baud. gr. and Vaikhānasa gr. (IV. 6) employ the mantra &ldquo;ürjam vahantir&rsquo; (Vāj. S. II, 34) for the same purpose. It may be noted that</p>
<p>980 a. It will be noticed that Āsv. omits several details viz. (1) he does not say that the brāhmaṇas for all the gods are to be seated, facing the east; (2) he mentions no mantra such as &lsquo;ye agnidadghã &amp;c.;&rsquo; (3) nothing is said about dakşinā or about the performer following the brahmanas a few paces and then returning with their permission.</p>

T. 20. 9 sets down the whole procedure very succinctly after the brahmanas have taken the dinner as follows: भुक्तवतोनुव्रज्य प्रदक्षिणीकृत्य वैधं दक्षिणाग्रान् वर्भान संस्तीर्य तेषूत्तरैरपो दत्त्वोत्तरदक्षिणापवर्गान पिण्डान् दत्वा पूर्ववदुत्तरैरपो तत्वोत्तरैरुपस्थायोत्तरयोदपात्रेण त्रिः प्रसव्यं परिषिच्य न्युज्य पात्राण्युत्तरं यजुरनवान वरा</li>

<p>these sūtras which belong to the Taittiriya sakhā employ a Verse from another recension viz. the Sukla Yajurveda.</p>
<p>The Hir. Gr. (II. 10-13) is more elaborate than the Ap. Gr. and not only sets out at length many of the mantras in Āp. M. P. II. 19-20, but adds some more. The Srāddhasūtra of Kātyāyana (1-3) sets out the procedure of the monthly sraddha almost in the same way as the Yājñavalkyasmrti (which is set out below). It states that in the monthly śrāddha first come the daiva rites and then the various items occur as in the Pinda-pitryajña pindapitryajña-vad-upacāraḥ&rsquo; (first sūtra of the 2nd kandikā). Some details which it contains (and Yāj. does not expressly mention) may be set out here. It gives in full the mantras &ldquo;tilosi&rsquo;, &lsquo;yā divya&rsquo; (both of which occur in Ašv. gr.), &lsquo;prthivi to pātram&rsquo; (which is Āp. M. P. II, 20.1). It prescribes that in addition to the Gāyatri and the Madhumati verses the word &lsquo;madhu&rsquo; should be repeated thrice. The holy texts to be repeated while the brāhmaṇas are engaged in eating according to Kātyāyana are the Gāyatri (once or thrice), the five Rākşoghni verses (Rg. IV. 4.1-5, Vaj. S. XIII. 9-13, Tai. S. T. 2. 14. 1-2). Purusasūkta, the Apratiratha hymn (Rg X. 103. 1-13 = Vaj. S. 17. 33-34, 46 = Tai. S. IV. 6. 4. 1-4) and others. It expressly states that the svadhāvācana (Yāj. I. 244) relates to both paternal and maternal ancestors. Besides the blessing contained in Yāj. I. 246, Katyāyana provides that the performer is to pray for and the brāhmaṇas are to pronounce two more viz. May the pitrs be kind (lit. not dreadful) to us&rsquo; and &lsquo;May our family prosper&rsquo;. Dr. Caland in his learned work &lsquo;Altindi scher Ahnencult&rsquo; (pp. 150–152) appears inclined to hold that when a sūtrakāra has not actually said anything on certain items in the śrāddha ritual, one has no right to anticipate, on the authority of later authors, that those items existed in the times of that sūtrakāra. I demur to this conclusion. Dr. Caland has attached no weight to the fact that Jaimini (as stated in H. of Dh, vol. III p. 870) laid down the principle that one may include certain items from another sākhā. Jaimini&rsquo;s sūtras cannot be supposed to have laid down those propositions for the first time. Jaimini&rsquo;s sūtras are at least as old as some of the extant srauta sütras such as that of Katyāyana. Therefore hardly any chrono logical conclusions can be drawn with certainty from the silence of a sūtrakāra as to a certain item in the śrāddha ritual.</p>

The brāhmaṇas invited should be even in number (2, 4 &amp;c.) according to the performer&rsquo;s re sources at the daiva rite (i. e. the Vaišvadevika brāhmanas should be two, four &amp;c.) and uneven (three or five &amp;c.) at a (pārvana) śrāddha for the pitrs; the brāhmaṇas should be seated in a pure (cow dunged) plot screened on all sides and sloping towards the south. At the daiva (part of pārvana śrāddha when Viśve-devāḥ are to be invoked) two brāhmaṇas facing the east should sit down and three brāhmaṇas facing the north should be seated in the rite for the pitrs or only one may be seated for each (i, e, in daiva and in pitrya). The same rule applies to a śrāddha for maternal ancestors. In both (pitrśrāddha and mātāmahasraddha) the worship of Viśve devas may be performed separately or simultaneously 983.

The performer, having scattered sesamum seeds all round (the brāhmanas) with the mantra &lsquo;Apahatā&rsquo; (Vāj. S.

The Firagpro (VII. 1. 206. 17) provides a FU ETA Hrga araarai agrariaa qui: rauti FELTETAN.&rsquo; In offering each of the things in daiva or pitrya rite in sraddha water must be given before and after. The मिता. says that here the method called काण्डानुसमय (and not पदार्थानुसमय) has to be followed. These two are dealt with in Jai. V. 2.1-15. Vide H. of Dh, vol. II. pp. 739-740. In this case if there are three brahmanas, water, kusas and water are all to be given to one, then the same three to the second and the same three to the third This is a TVEIDHAT. If water is given one after another to the three, then kusas one after another to them, then water one after another to three, that would be पदार्थानुसमय. काण्ड means पदार्थवर्ग. EATIE (on tr. pp. 759-766) has an exhaustive and lucid discussion on these two. He states that पदार्थानुसमय is the rule but काण्डानुसमय also has to be followed in certain cases. For example, on p. 764 he says &rsquo; TOT 13ar चमनप्रदानासनोपवेशनानि पदार्थानुसमयेन । आसनक्षणावाहनार्धगन्धपुष्पधूपदीपाच्छादनानां Tariat great anugaraaraang rescatau aquateur and relies on y.

Vide आश्व. गृ. in note 966 above for शं नो देवीः, तिलोसि, या दिव्याः . The मन्त्र is &lsquo;अपहता असुरा रक्षांसि वेदिषदः (वाज. सं. II. 29). The बहचगृह्यपरिशिष्ट, अपरार्क (p.484) and others say that the name and gotra of the ancestors should be mentioned in offering पाद्य, अर्घ्य, गन्ध etc. Therefore the अय॑ will be offered in the form &lsquo;अमकगोत्र पितरमकामतत्य मा, हलायुध (folio 18a on श्राद्धसूत्र) notes that in the case of वाजसनेयs the last words are एष तेऽर्घः.</p>

<p>मेक्षण is a rod of Asvattha woodone aratni long having at one end a square board four angulas in length (to be used like a mixing spoon ). Two offerings are made with the words अझये कव्यवाहनाय स्वधा नमः, सोमाय पित मते स्वधा नमः (वाज. सं II. 29 where the same formula occurs with स्वाहा for स्वधा नमः). Acc. to Baud, Dh. SII. 8.8-11 the offerings are three viz. toसोमाय पितृपीताय, यमायाङ्गिरस्वते पितृमते, अग्नये कन्यवाहनाय स्विष्टकृते. Acc.to मद.पा. p. 590 this is peculiar to Baudhayaniyas. The ब्रह्मपुराण q. by मद. पा. (p.591) speaks of आहुतित्रय and so does Brahmānda (upodghata, 11.93-94). If the performer is आहिताग्नि and has observed सर्वाधान method he offeres into दक्षिणाग्नि: if he is not आहितानि or has followed अर्धाधान method he offers into grhya or āvasathya fire and if he has neither the srauta or gryba fire he offers into the hand of the brahmana. For the procedure of पिण्डपितृयज्ञ (which varies from one sakha and sutra to another ) vide H. of Dh. vol. II. pp. 1085-1090 and मनु III. 212 for पाणिहोम. The food offered on the hand has to be mixed with the food served in tbe plate and then eaten. When there are several pitrya brahmanas invited the TOETA is to be made on the hand of the best of the brahmanas acc, to the मद. पा.585 and स्मृतिच. (श्रा. p.462), both of which quote गोभिल II. 120 &lsquo;पित्र्ये यः पडिमूर्धन्यस्तस्य पाणावनग्निमान् । हुत्वा मन्त्रवदन्येषां तूष्णीं पात्रेषु निक्षिपेत् ॥१. हलायुध holds that, since या. (10237 हुतशेषं प्रदद्यात्तु भाजनेषु समाहितः) employs the word भाजनेषु without aky quali fication, the remnants of the food for a should be put in all places including those for दैवब्राह्मणs.

He, being intent (only on performing śrāddha correctly), should serve the food that remains after (making the two offerings mentioned above) in plates (except earthen one) that he may be able to secure, and particularly silver oness (plates are meant for feeding pitsya brāhmaṇas). After serving the food in the plates, he should invoke over the plates the mantra &rsquo;the earth is thy 992 support&rsquo;, he should take hold of the thumb of the brāhmanas and put it on the food (served in the plates) with the mantra 993 idam Visnur&rsquo; (&lsquo;Visnu strode over this&rsquo; Rg. I. 22. 17, Vāj, S. V. 15, Tai S. I. 2. 13. 1). The performer should then mutter the Gāyatri verse (Rg. III. 62. 10, Vāj. S. III. 35, Tai. S. I. 5. 6. 4) together with &lsquo;Om&rsquo; and the</p>

He should serve without anger or bustle food fit for being offered as havis (in a śrāddha) and liked by the brāhmaṇas till they are satiated (so that some food is left in their plates) and should repeat (while the brāh maņas are engaged in eating) sacred texts and the texts for Japa (Gāyatri &amp;c. already referred to in Yaj. I. 239 above). The sacred texts to be repeated according to the Mit, on Yāj. I. 240 are the Purusasūkta (Rg. X. 90. 1-16), the Pāvamāni verses (i. e. verses like &lsquo;svādişthayā madişthayā&rsquo; from the 9th mandala of the Rgveda as stated by Medhātithi on Manu III, 86 and Haradatta on Gautama (19. 12). Manu III. 232 mentions other works for recitation such as the dharmaśāstras, ākhyānas, itihāsa (Mahābhārata), purāṇas and khilas (like Śrīsākta and Vidyāsūkta).

<p>TOTTA सप्तव्याधा इति च पठ्यते&rdquo;. These very verses occur in the आग्निपुराण chap. 117. -56-57. The story is very clearly set out in errat 1, Chapters 21-24 and the Matsyapurana chap. 20-21. Sever pupils of Garga guarding their guru&rsquo;s cow thought of eating that cow as they were famished. But the youngest said &rsquo;let us make use of the cow&rsquo;s flesh in sraddha, so that we may be saved from sin&rsquo;. Two of the brothers became daiva brahmanas, three became pitr-brāhmanas, one became the giver and the 7th became a guest, They told the guru that the cow was eaten by a tiger. They passed through several births first as seven hunters, then deer in Kalañjara bill and so on. Sraddha ultimately saved them. The same story is narrated in Padma V. 10.49-125, and v. 47.282-304 (in which last the disciples are said to have been those of any). After becoming hamsas three of them became kings (a king and two ministers, acc. to FET) and cared not for the other world. The four others knew the path to moksa, sent word to the three with these verses saying that they four had started on the long road to the other world (Frat&hellip;arci) and asking the other three not to be immersed in the mire of wordliness (77&hellip; ). The story also occurs in the BERTIOT (SATIEAT chap. 41.24 ff). It is interesting to note that in the Jaina Uttaradhyayana-sūtra (S. B. E. vol. 45 p. 56) the echoes of this story of the brothers are heard for illustrating the influence of karman,</p>

Collecting all the cooked food (i, e. portions from each food) with sesamum mixed with it, the performer facing the south should offer the pindas near the remains of the food (eaten by the brāhmanas) according to the procedure of the pindapitryajña, For maternal ancestors also the same procedure is to be followed (from invoking the Visve devāḥ to offering pindas). Then he should give water to the brāhmaṇas for sipping. Then (he should say to the brāhmaṇas pronounce benediction&rsquo;); after making the brāhmanas say svasti&rsquo;, he should offer water into their hands for saying &rsquo;let it be inexhaustible (after he requests them &rsquo;let it be inexhaustible&rsquo;).

Then the brāhmanas should say &rsquo;let there be svadhā&rsquo;. On the brāhmanas saying so, he should sprinkle water on the ground and say &rsquo;let the Visve devāḥ be pleased&rsquo; and when the brāhmaṇas have responded with ‘let the Viśve&ndash;devāḥ be pleased&rsquo; he should mutter the follow</p>

<p>Many of the Puranas contain detailed descriptions of the śrāddha to be performed on every amāvāsyā; for example, Matsya 17. 12-60 (closely resembling Yāj. 225-259), Vispu purāņa III. 15. 13-49, Mārkandeya 28. 37-60, Kūrma (II. 22. 20-62), Padma (srstikhanda) 9. 140-186), Brahmānda (Upod ghātapāda, chap. 12), Skanda VI. 224. 3-51, Vişnudharmottara I. 140.6-44. The Agnipurāņa chap. 163 verses 2-42 are the same (with very slight variations and the omission of 23 verses) as Yāj. I. 227-270; while Agni chap. 117 contains many verses that closely follow the Āśv. Gr. and Yāj. Similarly the Garuda puräna contains numerous verses that are identical with Yājñavalkya&rsquo;s. For example, compare Yāj. I. 229-239 with Garuda I. 99. 11-19. The Purānas closely follow the Grhya gütras, Manu and Yājñavalkya and often employ the same mantras and formulas, though here and there they introduce some details. As remarked by the Varāhapurāna 14.51, the procedure for śrāddha is the same in all Purānas (iyam sarva purānesu sāmányā paitriki kriyā). For sample, a summary of the procedure in the Padma (srsti 9. 140-186) is set out here, The performer having honoured the Viśve-devāḥ (i. e. the brāh mana or brāhmaṇas invited to represent them) with a seat and with yava grains and flowers should fill two vessels with water and should place them on a pavitra of darbhas. The water should be offered with the verse &lsquo;sam no devir&rsquo; (Rg. X. 9.4) and the yava grains with &lsquo;Yavogi&rsquo;. They should be invoked with the verse &lsquo;Vißve devāsah&rsquo; (Rg. II, 41.13) and yavas should be scat tered about with the two verses Viśve devāsah&rsquo; (Rg. II. 41. 13-14) and he should scatter about yava grains with the verse thou art yava, the king of grains &amp;c.&rsquo; ( quoted 1003 below).

He should then remove the pipdas and request the brāhmaṇas to utter the word &lsquo;svasti&rsquo; and they should do so. The remains of the food eaten by the brāhmanas remain (unremoved or unwiped) till the brāhmanas are dismissed; then he should perform the (usual) daily rites Vaišvadeva, balihoma1009 &amp;c. The remnants of food that lie on the ground are the share of the group of slaves that were straight-forward and not roguish (dishonest or shirkers ). The performer holding a vessel full of water and muttering the verse &lsquo;vāje vāje&rsquo; (Rg. VII. 38. 8, Vāj. S. IX. 18, Tai. S. I. 7. 8. 2) should touch the brāhmaṇas with the tip of kušas and dismiss them. He should follow them out of his house for eight paces, should circumambulate them, should then return with his rela tives, sons and wife, should then perform the daily Vaišvadeva and balihoma. Then after Vaišvadeva he should together with his relatives, sons, guests and servants partake of the food that remains in the cooking pots after what was eaten by the brāhmaṇas.</p>
<p>It should be noticed how closely the Padmapurana follows the procedure (including the mantras ) contained in Yājña valkya. What procedure the author of a Purāņa follows depends upon his learning and the sūtra that he studied. For example, the Visnudharmottara 1.140 appears to rely on the Ap.gr. and the Ap. M. P. (II. 19-20), since I. 140, 12 refers to Āp. M. P. II, 19.1., 1. 140.29-30 to Ap. M. P. II. 19. 14-16, I. 140. 35 to Āp. M. P. II, 20.1. Similarly, Skanda (VI. 224. 3-51) closely follows Āśv. gr and Yāj.</p>
<p>Owing to the difference in details of śrāddha in the several grhyasūtras, the smrtis and the purāņas, an important question arises whether a person should perform a śrāddha rite only in accordance with the gặhyasūtra of his own Veda or Sākhā or whether he may perform it after the inclusion (upasamhāra ) of</p>

<p>IV] The maxim of &lsquo;sarvasakhāpratyaya&rsquo; 453 the several items found in other sütras and smrtis though not included in the kalpa or grhya sūtra of his own Sākhā. This topic is discussed at great length by Hemādri (on srāddha ) pp. 748-759 and briefly by Medhātithi on Manu II, 29 and XI.216, by the Mit, on Yāj. III. 325, Aparārka p. 1053 and others. Those who are for strictly following the details in one&rsquo;s own sūtra alone argue as follows: If one were at liberty to include details other than those contained in one&rsquo;s own sūtra, the order of the details ( krama) given in one&rsquo;s sutra and the time specified for each detail would be interfered with. Besides, if the addition of details were permissible, one would be liable to the charge of giving up the usages of one&rsquo;s own family handed down for generations. These objectors rely upon such passages as that of the Visnudharmottara which states &lsquo;He who violating (the dictates of ) his own sūtra acts according to a sutra meant for others, treats thereby his own sage ( the author of his sūtra ) as unauthoritative and incurs (the blame of) doing what is im proper.&rsquo; 1010 The smrtis that contain additional details may be meant for those men who have no kalpa or grhya sütra of their own or they may be useful for Śūdras.</p>
<p>Those who espouse the view that as far as possible all details found in several grhyasūtras and smrtis on one rite should be included by every one rely mainly on Jaimini II. 4. 8-33 which is called &lsquo;sakhāntarādhikarananyāya&rsquo; or &lsquo;sarvasākhāpratyaya nyāya&rsquo;. The principal sutra is Jai. II. 4. 9.1011 It is established in this gūtra that the prayoiana (purpose ) or phala (reward to be secured) of the rite is the same in different sūtras and smrtis. For example, the rewards of śrāddha are stated to be the same in all sūtras and smộtis (vide notes 787-790 above); then the dravya (materials) and the deity are the same (in Parvana śrāddha the deities are the paternal ancestors and the materials,</p>

The effort that is enjoined the vidhi) is the same and the name (Pārvanaśrāddha, Ekoddista sraddha &amp;c.) is the same. Therefore, on account of these various signs one easily recog nizes that the same rite is being dealt with by all sūtras, even if many of them differ in details. It cannot be said that smrtis will be useful for those who have no sutras of their own. Each man of the first three varņas is attached to some sūtra or other by the tradition of his family or caste. Similarly, the smrtis cannot be held to be meant for sūdras alone, since the smrtis mainly deal with upanayana, the study of the Vedas, agnihotra and other matters with which a sūdra has no concern. Similar ly, the objection that if details were allowed to be inserted from other sūtras and smrtis the krama and kāla prescribed in one&rsquo;s Sūtra might have to be set aside, the reply is contained in Jai. I. 3. 5-7 (explained at great length in H. of Dh. vol. III. pp. 841-848 ).1012 The fruti says after getting ready a bundle of kusa grass he prepares the vedi (altar)&rsquo;. Here a certain order of acts is laid down. If after a bundle of kušas is got ready, the man has a sneeze, he has to sip water (perform ūcamana ) immediately as laid down by Manu V. 145 and Vas. III. 38 before he prepares the vedi. So the objector says the krama will be interfered with. The reply is that the sequence (krama) is only a characteristic of the items in the śruti passage, that all that is meant is that the making of the altar follows the getting ready of a kusa bundle, but that it is not meant that the making of the vedi should follow immediately after the bundle is got ready. Therefore, the conclusion is that whatever detail is not in conflict with one&rsquo;s own sākhā or sutra may be in cluded in the rite one is about to perform, but if there is a direct conflict, then one should stick to one&rsquo;s own sūtra. As observed by Kätyāyana &lsquo;whatever is declared, whether in great detail or in brief, in one&rsquo;s own grhyasūtra about a rite, if he performs that much, it may be taken that he has done all that is required of him; but what is not handed down in one&rsquo;s sākhā (or sūtra) but is contained in another sākhā and is not in conflict with one&rsquo;s ovn sākhā, should be performed by the learned, as in the case of</p>

<p>agnihotra and the like&rsquo;. 1013 The first verse of Katyayana may be explained as applying where one&rsquo;s sākhā or sūtra deals with a matter without requiring any addition or as the next best course where one is not able to supplement one&rsquo;s sūtra owing to some unseen cause or owing to human difficulties. The Sangraha says that where different items of the śrāddha rite are declared to be performed at different times and there is no agreement among the sages, one should follow one&rsquo;s grhya sutra, but where one&rsquo;s grhyasūtra is silent as to a certain item or as to the stage when it is to be performed, there is an option and one may follow the opinion of some gage as to that item. 1014 It appears that even the ancient grhya sūtras exhibit tendencies that led to the sarvasākhā-pratyaya-nyāya e. g. Ašv. gr. (q. in n. 966) employs several passages (such as &lsquo;Tilosi&rsquo;, &lsquo;Ya. divyā,&rsquo; which do not occur in the Rgveda.)</p>
<p>It is owing to this maxim of &lsquo;sarvasākhā-pratyayanyāya&rsquo; that medieval digests go on heaping up details from all smrtis and purāṇas in their descriptions of the several šrāddhas, the procedures of which were not originally very extensive.</p>
<p>The Kūrmapurāna 1015 provides that the performer should before noontime is past bring to his house the invited brāhmanas</p>

<p>who have shaved themselves and pared their nails, should offer them materials for brushing the teeth and request them to sit down on separate seats, then give them oil and water for bathing. It will be seen that here the purāpa has added several details that were not provided for by the Āśv. gs. (n. 966), Manu (III. 208 ), Yāj. (I. 226) and even by some of the purāņas such as the Varaha 14, 8, which begin the procedure with seat ing the brāhmanas in the afternoon on seats after welcoming them. Many more examples could be given, but that attempt is not made owing to considerations of space.</p>
<p>Before proceeding to give some idea as to how the pārvana śrāddha was dealt with in medieval and modern times, observa tions must be made on several relevant matters, on which there is a difference of views or which are important in a general way.</p>
<p>When the invited brāhmanas come after noon, it is pro vided in some of the purāņas that two mandalas should be made in front of the performer&rsquo;s residence for receiving the brāh maņas. For example, the Nāradapurāņa states1016 the mandala for a brāhmaṇa performer should be square (four cornered) in size, for a kşatriya triangular, circular for a vaišyà and for a sūdra mere sprinkling of the ground with water is enough.&rsquo; The mandalas should be made on ground smeared with cowdung and with water mixed with cow&rsquo;s urine. Of the two mandalas one should be on the northern side sloping towards the north and the other on the southern side sloping towards the south. On the northern mandala kuģas with points towards the east should be placed along with akşata (unbroken or whole) grains and on southern one double-folded kusas should be placed along with sesamum grains. The northern mandala should generally be two cubits on each side while the southern one should be four cubits on each side. The brāhmana or brāhmaṇas that repre sent the Viśvedevāh should be honoured in the northern mandala first by the performer himself with water for washing their feet after bending his right knee and the brāhmaṇas representing the pitrs should be then honoured in the southern mandala with water for washing the feet (hence called padya) after bending his left knee.

<p>The ancient sūtras and smộtis like those of Manu and Yāj. (T. 229) say generally that the Viśvedevāḥ are to be invoked, but some of the later smrtis (such as Prajapati, verses 179-190) and purāṇas contain verses enumerating ten names of Viśve devās and assign two each (out of the ten) to five classes of śrāddhas. They say: 1018 &ldquo;in śräddha performed in an işti the Visvedevas are Kratu and Daksa, in a Nándimukha śrāddha they are Vasu and Satya, in Kamyaśraddha Dhuri and Locana, in naimittika śrāddha Kāla and Kāma and in Pārvana-śrāddha Purūravas and Ardrava&rsquo;. According to the Sm. C. and Hemādri a seat (āsana) is to be given to the Vaišvadeva brāhmanas and invocations are to be made in the several śrāddhas after taking the names enumerated above.

The आ. प्र. p. 23 notes the different readings of some of the names such as पुरूरवस् and आर्द्रव, some saying the first is पुरूरव and the second is मादव. The printed श्राद्धतच p. 199 has माद्रव and so has टोडरानन्द (श्राद्धसौख्य folio 57 a). श्राद्धतत्व explains इष्टिश्राद्ध as इच्छाश्राद्ध and नैमित्तिक as एकोद्दिष्ट. The श्रा. क्रि. कौ. (p.56) reads पुरोरवाः and मादवाः. कल्पतरु (श्रा. p. 142) reads मावश्च दशैते तु. The ब्रह्माण्डपुराण (III. 3.30-31) enumerates the ten विश्वेदेवाः somewhat differently. It reads&rsquo;पुरूरवो माद्रवसो रोचमानश्च&rsquo;. The ब्रह्माण्ड (III. 12.3ff.) states that ten sons were born to asar, one of the daughters of ear. When they performed severe tapas on a Himalaya peak Brahma gave them the boon they wanted (श्राद्धेश्माकं भवेदंशो ह्येष नः कांक्षितो वरः) and the pitrs agreed. The pitrs said (verse ra) &lsquo;अग्रे दत्त्वा तु युष्माकमस्माकं दास्यते ततः । विसर्जनमथास्माकं पूर्व पश्चानु दैवतम् THIS legend is obviously an attempt to explain the usage about vaisvadova brahmanas at a श्राद्ध.</p>

<p>for invoking the Viśvedevas in Pārvana-śrāddha are two viz. &ldquo;Viśvedevāsa āgata&rsquo; (Rg. II, 41.13) and &lsquo;āgacchantu mahābhāgā&rsquo; (q. above in note 984), while the Sm. C. (p. 444) prescribes an additional mantra &lsquo;viśve devāḥ śruņuta&rsquo; (Rg. VI. 52. 13).</p>
<p>The general rule is that the Vaišvadeva brāhmaṇas are to be seated facing the east and the pitrya brāhmaṇas facing the north (Yāj. I. 228, Varāha 14. 11), but there were at least five differing views about the directions which the brāhmanas were to face as Hemādri (on śrāddha p. 1200) points out. It is fur ther pointed out by Hemādri and others (like Yāj. I. 247) that in all items in the procedure of śrāddha the Vaišvadevika brāhmaṇas have precedence except in the matter of washing the hand smeared with the remains of food and the final dismissal of the brahmanas at the end of the śrāddha.1019 It may be noted that in southern and western India brāhmaṇas invited at śrāddha are worshipped, while in Bengal it is the effigy made with darbhas (darbhabatu) that is worshipped as shown by the late M. M. Haraprasad Shastri (Catalogue of Mss, vol. III p. 406). The Srāddha-tattva (folio 2b) of Raghunandana provides for the same: &lsquo;purūravā-mādravasor viśveşām devānām pārvana-śrāddham kusamayabrāhmane karisye iti prcchet.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In the Vāyupurāpa 1020 it is stated that the following mantra should be repeated thrice at the beginning and end of a śräddha and at the time of offering pindas; on repeating it the pitrs come quickly to the śrāddha and rāksasas run away and that the mantra saves the pitrs in all the three worlds. The mantra is &lsquo;Perpetual adoration to the gods, to pitrs and to the great Yogins, to svadhā, to svāhā&rsquo;. The Sm. C. (on śrāddha</p>

As almost in every case there are different views here also. Brhaspati says: &lsquo;when giving a seat, when offering arghya, or pindas, in offering ablutions of water on pindas, the performer has to declare his relation to each of the ancestors, the names and gotras of the ancestors and also the form in which each of the ancestors is to be contemplated (viz, as Vasu, Rudra, Aditya respectively). It is further laid down that the genitive is to be employed for the ancestor&rsquo;s name in offering a seat ( to the pitrya brāhmaṇa) and aksayyodaka, the objective in invoking the pitrs, the dative in offering food, the vocative in other cases.</p>
<p>It is laid down that the perfornier has to take ācamana (sip water) in śrāddha rite six times viz., at the commencement of śrāddha, when washing the feet of invited brāhmanas, in wor shipping them, in making the vikira, in offering pindas and at the end of the srāddha, 1022</p>

<p>An important question which exercised the minds of many medieval writers was &lsquo;who was the real recipient (sampradāna)1023 of the offerings made in śrāddha, whether the brāhmaṇas or the pitrs&rsquo;. Relying on the words of the Āśv. gr. IV.8.1 (quoted above in n. 966 etasmin kāle &hellip; dānam) and passages of the purāņas such as the Varāha (13. 51) &lsquo;vibhave sati viprebhyo asmān uddiśya dāsyati&rsquo;, the Mahārnavaprakāśa, Harihara and some others held that brāhmaṇas were the recipients, while others like Sridatta, relying on indications furnished by śruti passages like Vāj. S. 19. 36 (akşan pitarah amimadanta pitarah) and such formulas as &lsquo;pitar-etat te arghyam&rsquo; or &rsquo;etadvah pitaro vāsaḥ,&rsquo; held that the real recipients intended were the pitrs, but, as the pitrs had gone to another world and could not be bodily present to receive the gifts of such things as sandlewood paste, flowers and clothes, the latter were only handed over or assigned to the brāhmaṇas who were for the moment contemplated as not different from the pitrs.1023a Vide Sm. C. (śrāddha pp. 447 449 ), Śr. Pr. pp. 30-31 for a discussion of these two view points. It should, however, be noted that the water given to the brāhmaṇas and the dakşiņā given to them were only meant for the brāhmanas, the former for purification and the latter for the inexhaustible merit that dakşiņā to brāhmanas conferred.</p>
<p>It is to be noted that in the invocation (āvāhana) of the pitrs there is a divergence of views as to the mantras to be employed and also as to the stage when it is to be made. Hemādri (śrāddha, pp. 1254-56) states that there were five different views on the latter point, the three most important of which were that āvāhana should come before giving darbhas as āsana on the left side of the seats of the pitrya brāhmanas or after giving such darbhas or after agnaukaraña. As regards the former (viz. the mantras), Yāj. (I. 232-233), the Brahmānda purāna and several others say that the invocation mantra is * uśantas-tvā&rsquo; (Rg. X. 16. 12, Vāj. S. 19. 70, Tai. S.

<p>permission from the brāhmanas should invite the Manes. Having driven away the Yatudhānas (demons) by strewing grains of sesamum and by reciting the two mantras (the first of which begins with &lsquo;may the Asuras go away) he should invite the Manes with the four mantras &lsquo;come near, ye Manes!&rsquo;, &lsquo;conduct them here, O Agnil&rsquo;, &lsquo;May my (ancestors ) come near&rsquo;, &rsquo;this is your (share), O Manes&rsquo;. Hemādri (śrāddha pp. 1260-1267) points out how the mantras differ according to different writers.</p>
<p>There is a great deal of discussion about agnaukarana men tioned in Yaj. I. 236-237. The Mit. points out that if a man has kept srauta fires by the sarvādhāna method then in the pārvaņa-śrāddha that he offers after pindapitryajña he offers homa in the Dakşiņāgni, as he has no aupāsana (i. e. grhya) fire and supports this by quoting a passage which occurs in the Vişnudharmottara-purāna,1025 But if a man consecrates the śrauta fires by the ardhādhāna 1026 method, then he has to offer pārvana homa in the aupāsana fire and one who is without srauta fires and has kept up only aupāsana fire has to offer homa in that fire. One who has neither the srauta fires nor the gļhya fire offers it in the brāhmana&rsquo;s hand only. The Mit. relies on Manu III. 212 and on two verses from a grhya and comes to the conclusion that one who has consecrated śrauta fires performs homa in daksina fire in the case of Anvastakya śräddha, the grāddha on the day previous to Astakā, the sraddha</p>

Vide Hemādri (srāddha pp. 1328-1344), Bālambhatti (on ācāra p. 518). The Todarānanda (śräddha saukhya ) following Manu III. 282 states that one who is an Agnihotrin cannot perform a pārvana-śrāddha on any day except on darśa (i. e, on amāvāsyā).</p>
<p>Another important question on which there is great diver gence concerns the number of āhutis to be offered in agnau karana, the deities to whom the homa was to be offered, the order in which the deities were to be named and the form of words to be used. On these matters there appears to have been divergent views from very ancient times. According to the Śat. Br. II, 4. 2. 12-13 the āhutis were only 1027 two, they were offered to Agni and Soma in that order and the word svāhā was used at the end. According to the Tai. Br. I, 3.10.2–3 1028 the āhutis were three, they were to be offered to Soma, Agni and to Yama in that order and the formula ended with &lsquo;svadhā namah&rsquo; (and not with &lsquo;svāhā&rsquo;). It is therefore that a verse of Kātyā yana 1029 says &quot; whether to employ the word &lsquo;svāhā&rsquo; or the words</p>
<p>svadhā namah&rsquo;, whether and when to wear the sacred chord in the yajñopavīta form or präcināvita form and what was to be the number of āhutis-all these have to be understood from one&rsquo;s own sūtra.&rdquo; The difference of views which is noticed as far back as the Brāhmanas persists in the sütras, smrtis, purānas and is briefly indicated here. The Ap. Gr. S. (quoted above in n. 981 ) speaks of thirteen āhutis, seven with food and</p>

Some give the order as &lsquo;Soma accom panied by the pitrs, Agni the carrier of kavya, Yama Angiras;&rsquo; while others give it as &lsquo;Agni the carrier of kavya, Soma accompanied by the pitrs, Yama Vaivasvata &amp;c.&rsquo; It is further provided that the āhuti to Agni is made to the southern side of the fire, to Soma on the northern part of it and in the middle of the two sides to Vaivasvata (Yama ).1033</p>

<p>of silver. Kātyāyana says that the performer who has no fire (either srauta or smārta ) should offer the homa on the hand of the most eminent among the pitrya brāhmaṇas to the accom paniment of a mantra and should offer the remainder in the plates of the other pitrya brāhmanas.1034 The Sm. C. notes that Yama and the Vāyupurāna say that the homa should be in the hand of the daiva brāhmana and that on account of this conflict there is an option. It is further provided that a portion of the food from which agnaukarana was effected should be kept aside for making pindas (Mārkandeya and Garuda). The food should be served by the performer himself wearing the sacred thread in the yajñopavīta form or by his wife of the same caste or by some attendant who is purified. Manu (III. 224-229, 231-233, 236-238) contains several rules 1034a &lsquo;Himself holding the vessels full of food with both hands the performer should slowly place them near the brāhmanas seated for dinner while think ing of his ancestors.

<p>side dishes viz. broths, vegetables, milk, curds, gheo and honey on the ground and not on a wooden stool or the like). The vessels placed on the ground should contain various kinds of food (such as sweetmeats, pāyasa ), fruits and roots, delicious flesh, spiced or perfumed drinks. Having brought near the brāhmanas all the vessels containing food, he should serve it in the plates declaring the characteristic of each kind of food (saying this is sweet, this is sour&rsquo; &amp;c.). The performer while serving should not shed tears (remembering his ancestors ), he should not become angry, should not utter falsehood, he should not touch the vessel containing ) food with his foot and should not serve food with a violent jerk. Whatever is liked by the brahmanas should be served to them without any grumbling and he should talk about Brahma (or about Vedic riddles ), because that is agreeable to the pitrs. The performer himself, being pleased, should ( by his sweet speech ) gladden the brāhmaṇas, should make them partake of food without hurry, and should urge them on frequently (to take more food) by declaring the good points of the various items of food. All food should be steaming hot and the brāhmaṇas should partake of it silently and should not themselves speak of the good points of the food even when questioned by the performer. When the food is hot, when the brāhmaṇas eat in silence and when the good qualities of the food are not declared by the brāhmapas, the Fathers partake of it. When a brāhmana (at a śrāddha dinner) partakes of food, having his head covered with a garment (a turban &amp;c )or facing the south or having his sandals on, evil spirits partake of the food (and not the Fathers).&rsquo; As early as Gaut., it is provided that the food for the brāhmanas should be of the highest sort and should be enriched by condiments and flavoured.</p>
<p>Some of the other rules are : The Prajāpati-smrti (verses 57-62 ) states who should cook the food for the śrāddha dinner. The wife, any fortunate (or handsome) woman of the performer&rsquo;s gotra whose husband is living and who has a son or brother and is devoted to waiting upon her elders, the performer&rsquo;s teacher&rsquo;s wife, his maternal uncle&rsquo;s wife, paternal or maternal aunt, his sister, his daughter or daughter-in-law, all of them having their husbands alive, should engage in the cooking, of the food for śrāddha. Women of good family, who hayo a large progeny, whose husbands are alive and who are about 50.yoats old or these women if they have become widows, and the wife of one&rsquo;s paternal uncle or brother, one&rsquo;s mothers (natupator</p>

<p>step-mothers ) and the mothers of one&rsquo;s father may cook the śrāddha food and also a woman of the same gotra who is mild by temper. In the Anušāsana parva (92.15) it is stated that a woman belonging to a gotra other than that of the deceased should not be employed for cooking śräddha food. One&rsquo;s brother, paternal uncle, brother&rsquo;s son, sister&rsquo;s son, one&rsquo;s son, pupil, one&rsquo;s daughter&rsquo;s son or daughter&rsquo;s husband may also engage in cook ing the śrāddha food, but not a woman who wears a white and wet garment, who has let her hair loose, who does not wear a bodice, who is ill or who has bathed her head. Before the brāhmanas begin to eat, the food should be first served in the plates for the Vaiśvadeva brāhmaṇas and then in those of the pitrya brāhmaṇas (Vişnu Dh. S. 173. 13-14), but once the brāhmaṇas have begun to eat there is no such precedence; what ever each brāhmaṇa may be noted as requiring should be served to him (as indicated by Manu III, 231). The performer of the śräddha when serving food to the brāhmanas (including pitrya) wears his sacred thread in the upavita form. Though it is said that the food should be hot, that does not apply to such eatables as curds, fruits and roots and flavoured 1035 drinks (as Sankha XIV.13 and Skandapurāna say ). As Hemādri (śrāddha p. 1371) points out, the serving of food in a śrāddha rite should be done with the right hand supported by the left; besides, nothing should be served with the bare hand or with a single hand, but with a wooden ladle or other utensil (but not an iron one). All cooked food, all side dishes and ghee should be served with a ladle (and not with the bare hand) but not water or eatables like laddus. No salt was to be directly served (Vispu Dh. S, 79.12). In Kātyāyana&rsquo;s Srāddha-sūtra it is provided 1036 &ldquo;The food that remains after agnaukarana should be served in the plates of the pitrya brāhmaṇas and the performer should touch</p>

The Kalika-purana prescribes1037 that the thumb of the brāhmaṇa should be moved about in the food covered with ghee and honey with the mantra “the earth is thy vessel &amp;c.&rsquo; because Vişnu in the form of the thumb protects food meant for sacrifices to gods and manes. The Baud. Pitsmedhasūtra provides that while plunging the thumb of the brāhmaṇa in the food served it should be so arranged that the nail of the thumb is not smeared with food. 1038 Vasistha provides that the brāhmanas eating grāddha food should always hold the plate from which they are eating with (the left ) hand till the end of the dinner. Sankha-Likhita provide 1039 that brāhmaṇas (eating sraddha food ) should not declare the good or bad points of the food served, should not say what is untrue, should not praise each other, nor should they say there is plenty of food and drink (and so do not serve more food ),</p>

S. II. 32. Tai. S. III, 2.5.5), clarified butter with the mantra Tejosi sukram&rsquo;, curds with the mantra &ldquo;dadhikrāvno&rsquo; (Rg. IV. 39.6, Vāj. S. 23. 32, Tai. S. 1. 5. 11. 4). Ap. Dh, S. (II. 8. 18. 11) provides that the leavings of a śrāddha dinner should not be given to one who is inferior to the invited brāhmanas in qualities and Manu III, 249 states that the man who after eating śrāddha dinner gives the leavings to a śüdra falls in the Kālasūtra Hell.</p>
<p>The Matsyapurāna and some other works provide that the brāhmaṇas should pronounce blessings on the performer (who faces the east) after they have sipped water and have been given water, flowers and akşata grains. The performer prays &lsquo;May our Fathers be not terrible (i, e, be kind) to us. The brāhmanas reply &ldquo;let it be so&rsquo;. The performer prays &lsquo;May our family grow&rsquo;, &lsquo;May donors increase in our family and also food&rsquo;, ‘May these blessings turn out to be true&rsquo;. To all these the brāhmanas reply after each one of the prayers 1040 &ldquo;May it be so&rsquo;. There are rules about the time when the leavings or particles of food in the plates of the brāhmanas that ate the dinner should be removed or swept away. Vas. (XI. 21-22) and the Kūrma purāņa provide that the leavings of food should not be removed till the Sun sets, since streams of nectar flow from them, which are drunk by the spirits of) those departed persons for whom no water was offered. Manu III. 265 (which is the same as Matsya 17.56 and Padma, Srstikhanda 9.185) provides another rule that the leavings of the food in the plates may remain where they are till the brāhmapas are dismissed and depart.</p>

<p>Rules about removal of leavings</p>
<p>469</p>
<p>Hemadri (Sraddha, p. 1512 )1041 therefore provides that if the per former has another house the leavings may not be removed till sunset, but if he has only one house, they may be removed after the brāhmanas have gone away (vide Yāj. I. 257, Matsya 17.56 ). It is further provided by Brhaspati 1042 that the plates should not be removed before the brāhmanas pronounce the word &lsquo;svasti&rsquo;, and Jatākarnya 1043 and the Skandapurana say that the plates and the leavings should be removed by the performer himself or by his pupil or son, but not by women nor by a child nor by one who is not of the same caste. Manu III. 258 provides that, after the brāhmanas have left, the performer should look at the south and pray to the pitrs for certain blessings contained in Manu III, 259 which are the same as Yāj. I 246 translated above (vide p. 447), Visnu Dh. S. 73.28, Matsya 16.49-50. The Ap. gr. 20.9 (q. in note 981), Ap. Dh. S. II. 7. 17.16, Manu III, 264, Yāj. I. 249 provide that the performer should partake of the remainder of the food cooked for the śrāddha along with his wife, paternal and maternal relatives after recit ing (according to Haradatta) the Yājusa mantra (Ap. M. P. II. 20.26) which means &rsquo;entering the life breath I offer nectar; my soul is centred in Brahman for the sake of immortality. The Ap. gr. and Ap. Dh. S. provide 1044 that the performer must eat at least a morsel of the food left after serving to the brähmanas. Vyāsa and Devala prescribe that on the day of śräddha the per former must not observe a fast (even if he usually does so as on Ekādaśī or Sivarātra). A way out was provided by the Bra hmavaivarta-purana by recommending that the performer should merely smell the remnants of the śräddha food. Vide</p>

<p>Hemādri (śrāddha, pp. 1519-1521) for the discussion. Hemādri (p. 1485) refers to the practice (observed even now) that after the performer receives the blessings referred to above, his son, grandson and the like should offer adoration to the devatās in the form of pindas. The brāhmaṇas should praise the good characteristics of the food served at the end of the gräddha ceremony. 1045 The brāhmaṇas should not get up from the dinner, carelessly leaving remnants of food in their plates, but they may leave in the plates a little food except milk, curds, honey or barley flour. 1046</p>
<p>There were several views as to the exact stage at which the offerings of pindas were to be made. According to Sān. Gr. IV. 1.9., Āśv. gr. IV. 8. 12, 1047 Sankha 14.11, Manu III. 260-261, Yāj. I. 242 and several other works, the performer offers the lumps of boiled rice after the brāhmaṇas have finished eating their dinner. The pindas are made with boiled rice mixed with sesame and are placed on darbhas on a clean spot and at a distance of about one aratni from 1048 the plates in which the brāhmanas ate and the performer faces the south. Here again there are two opinions, one being that pindas were to be offered before the brāhmaṇas sip water (perform ācamana) after dinner (e. g. Äśv. gr. IV. 8. 12–13, Srāddha-sūtra of Kātyāyana, kaņdikā 3), while others hold that they were to be offered after the brāhmaṇas have rinsed their mouth and taken āca mana. Another view referred to as the view of some by Sān. gr. IV. 1.10 and Manu III, 261 was that pindas were to be offered to the ancestors first after honouring the invited brähmaņas or after agnaukarana and then the brāhmaṇas were to partake of the dinner.

<p>Time of offering pindas</p>
<p>401</p>
<p>Brahmāndapurāna 109 emphatically asserts that this is the correct position as stated by Brhaspati. The Visnu Dh. S. (73 15-24) provides that the pindas are to be offered to the ancestors while the brāhmaṇas are actually eating. A fourth view is that of the Ap. gr. 24.9, Hir. gr. (II. 12.2-3) which state that the per former1050 should, after the brahmanas have eaten and gone away and he has followed and circumambulated them, offer pindas. Owing to this conflict of views Hemādri (quoting smrti) and the Madanapārijāta (p. 600) say that each one should follow the procedure laid down in his own sākhā.1051 Hemādri adds that those in whose grhyasūtra no special time is mentioned for pindadāna should follow the view that pindas are to be offered after the brāhmanas have partaken of the dinner and sipped water. The Sr. P. (p.247) endorses this view.1052 The pindas were to be deposited on bunches of (25) darbhas for each pinda. Aparārka on Yāj. I. 24 states that in all cases without exception piņdas were to be offered near the plates from which the brāhmanas took their meals, while Hemādri who relies on Katyayana&rsquo;s word &lsquo;ucchistasannidhau&rsquo; says that where the performer is an āhitāgni the pindas were to be offered near his sacred fire, but when a performer had not kept the sacred fires pindas were to be offered near the plates from which brāhmaṇas ate the śrāddha food. The Śrāddhasāra (p. 163) quotes Atri to the effect that pindas should be offered at a distance of three aratnis from where the brāhmaṇas ate the śrāddha dinner and that in such śrāddhas as Navaśrāddhas Vaišvadeva is to be performed before piņdadana and that it is to be performed after</p>

<p>There is another conflict of views as regards the ancestors to whom pindas are to be offered at the śrāddha on amāvāsya. Most of the ancient Vedic works refer only to the three paternal ancestors as the devatās of the Pārvana-śrāddha and not to any other relatives. The three paternal ancestors are separately the devatās of śrāddha and not cumulatively, as indicated by the Āśv. Srauta II. 6.15 and Vişnu Dh. S. 73.13-14. The important questions are whether the wives of the paternal ancestors, viz, the mother, the grandmother and the paternal great-grandmother were associated with their husbands in ancient times and secondly, whether the three paternal ancestors of one&rsquo;s mother viz. the maternal grandfather, the maternal great-grandfather and the maternal great-great-grandfather were invoked together with their wives in the Pārvana. The answer to both these questions so far as the Vedas and Brāhmanas are concerned is in the negative, Vide Tai. S. I. 8. 5.1, Tai. Br. I. 3. 10, II, 6. 16, Vāj. S. 19. 36-37, Sat. Br. II, 4.2. 16, in all of which the only persons expressly named are the pitrs and three paternal ancestors. It may be noted, however, that in Vāj. S. 9. 19 (which is cited by Kātyāyana at the end of Srāddhasūtra 3 as the mantra to be recited when following the brāhmaṇas that are dismissed) there is a clear reference to paternal ancestors and also to mothers. Almost all sūtras also are silent as regards the invocation of the maternal ancestors in Pārvaņa-śrāddha along with paternal ones. Vide 1053 Āśv. Śr.; Sudargana on Ap. gr. VIII. 21. 2 states that the Sūtrakāra and Bhāsyakāra did not speak of Mātāmahaśrāddha as it is not obligatory for a daughter&rsquo;s son to offer it. The Srāddhasutra of Katyāyana 1054 speaks of three pindas being made for the paternal ancestors and three for the mother&rsquo;s paternal</p>

<p>IV1 Ancestors to whom pindas were offered 473 ancestors. The Gobhilasmrti provides 1055 that six pindas should be offered except in the Anvastakāśrāddha, the first śräddha (on the 11th day), the sixteen śrāddhas and the yearly śrāddha for a deceased person. Dhaumya 1056 prescribes that where the paternal ancestors are honoured (or fed) the mater nal ancestors also should be certainly honoured without making any difference (between the two classes ); if he makes a dis tinction the performer will go to Hell. The Vişnupurāna, 1057 the Brahmāndapurana and the Varāhapurāna say that some hold that a śrāddha for maternal ancestors is to be performed separately while other sages hold that one śrāddha is to be offered at the same time to the paternal and maternal ancestors. Bphaspati (q. by Kalpataru on śrāddha p. 204) prescribes 1058 that one should offer pindas made from all food cooked for the śrāddha and mixed with honey and sesamum grains for both paternal and maternal ancestors according to the rules of one&rsquo;s grhyasūtra. The Varāhapurāna (14. 40-41) says that pitrya brahmanas should be dismissed first and then the daiva brāh manas together with those for the mother&rsquo;s ancestors and that separate pindas were to be offered to the mother&rsquo;s paternal ancestors (14.37). Some held the view that the offering of pindas to maternal ancestors was obligatory for the putrikā putra 1059 (son of the appointed daughter) or for a daughter&rsquo;s son that inherited the wealth of his maternal grandfather. Brhat-Parāśara (chap. V. p. 153) montions several views on this point. It seems probable that when the appointment of a</p>

<p>daughter as a son became rare or went out of vogue the maternal ancestors came to be associated with the paternal ancestors in pārvana-śrāddha.</p>
<p>The question when the wives of ancestors became associa ted with the male ancestors cannot be solved satisfactorily. The pitāmahi is not mentioned in the extant. Vedic Literature. But it is certain that the wives of male ancestors had come to be associated with their husbands in the sutra period. For example, the Hir. Gr. II, 10 associates the mother, the paternal grandmother and the paternal great-grandmother with their respective husbands in the monthly śrāddha performed in the dark half. Similarly, the Baud. gr. II. 11.34 not only associates in the Astakā śräddha the male maternal ancestors with the male paternal ancestors, but also their respective wives. The Āp, M. P. 1060 has mantras referring to the three male paternal ancestors as well as their wives. The Sān. gr. (IV. 1.11) pro vides that behind the lumps for the paternal ancestors the per former places the lumps for their wives, putting something between the two sets of pindas and the commentator explains that darbhas are placed between the two sets. The Kausika sūtra (88.12) also provides for the offering of piņdas to the wives of male ancestors to the south of the pindas for male ancestors. The Āśv. gr. (II. 5. 4-5), while speaking of the Anvas takya rite, refers to pindas to be offered to the wives of ances tors with the addition of rum and the scum of boiled rice. The Vaikhānasa-smārta-sūtra IV. 7 (after describing the Pinda pitryajña in IV.5-6) notes that the difference between it and the ordinary monthly sraddha is that in the latter pindas are offered to the wives of the pitrs 1061. Dr. Caland (in &lsquo;Ahnencult&rsquo; p. 164) thinks that this inclusion of the women ancestors among those to whom pindas were to be offered was made by taking over from Anvastakya ceremonial described above. This con jecture does not look very probable. The Astakā rites existed from remote antiquity as shown above. If the offering of pindas to women ancestors were borrowed from the Anvastakya</p>

<p>Participation of females in pindas offered</p>
<p>475</p>
<p>this item would have figured in all sūtras just as Astakā śra ddha does. It is rather more probable that the extension to women was a natural growth in course of time. Some of the smrtis emphasize the participation of the wives of paternal ancestors in the pārvanasroddha offerings. Satatapa states 1062 : &ldquo;In what is offered to the pitrs after Sapiņdikarana, the mother is a participant everywhere. A śräddha may be separately offered to the mother in the Anvaştakā rites, in Vrddhi-śrāddha, at Gayā and on the anniversary of the day of her death; but in other cases it is performed along with the husband&rsquo;. It is stated by Brhaspati that the mother partakes of the śrāddha food along with her husband (i. e. the father of the performer); that the same rule applies to the paternal grandmother and the paternal great-grandmother 1063. The Kalpataru 1064 and others held that the wives of the paternal ancestors were not devatās in the pārvaņa-śrāddha, but they only enjoyed the ethereal food which came to the pitřs, while Hemādri and other sou thern writers held that the mother and other female ancestors were among the devatās of pārvaņa-śräddha, but not the step mother. There was a divergence of views whether the words &lsquo;mother&rsquo;, &lsquo;paternal grandmother&rsquo; and &lsquo;paternal great-grand&ndash;</p>
<p>mother&rsquo; included the co-wives(sapatnis) of these, Hemadri (on śräddha pp. 97-104) has a long disquisition on this question. According to one view the step-mother, the co-wife of the pita mahi and the co-wife of the prapitāmahi would be included in</p>

It is provided by Gobhila-grhya 1071 that if he does not know the names of his ancestors he should put down the first pinda with the Formula</li>
</ul>
<p>svadhā to the Fathers dwelling on the earth&rsquo;, (he should put down) the 2nd pinda with the formula &lsquo;svadhā to the fathers dwelling in the air&rsquo;, the third with the formula ‘svadha to the Fathers dwelling in heaven&rsquo; and should recite in a low voice the words &lsquo;Here, O Fathers, gladden yourselves, show your vigour each according to his own part.&rsquo; Yama quoted by Kalpataru (on Sr. p. 203), following Gobhila provides generally (whether the ancestors be known or not) that the first pinda should be offered to the father with the expression prthivi&rsquo;, the second to the grandfather in the aerial regions and the third to the paternal great-grandfather with the mantra &lsquo;dyaur darvi&rsquo;. The Visnu Dh.S. (73.17-19) has similar provisions, the mantras respectively being prthivi darviraksita&rsquo;, &lsquo;antariksam darvi raksita,&rsquo; dyaur-darviraksita&rsquo;. Medhatithi on Manu III. 194 says (following ASv. Sr. and others) that if the names of the ancestors are not known he should simply say “O Father, Grandfather&rsquo; &amp;c. If the gotra be not known then he should employ the gotra name Kaśyapa. 1072</p>

<p>undried āmalaka fruit, of the size of a bilva fruit in Ekoddista, - in navaśrāddhas the pinda should be bigger than in any one of</p>
<p>the preceding when offered every day during the days of impu rity on death. The Skandapurāņa says that pindas should be of such a size as would enable a calf two years old to put it easily into its mouth. 1073 Angiras (q. by Sm. C. p. 475 and Hemādri, śrāddha p. 1429) prescribes that the pindas may be of the size of kapittha or bilva fruit or of the size of a hen&rsquo;s egg or of an āmalaka or badara fruit. In the Maitrāyaṇīya-sūtra 1094 it is said that the pinda for the paternal grandfather should be bigger than that for the father and should be in the middle (of the three pindas), that the pinda for the great-grandfather should be the largest of all. The next point is from what materials the pindas were to be made. If pindas were offered before agnau karana they were to be made from the boiled rice (caru) prepared for agnaukarana. If made after agnaukarana, the pindas were to be made from the cooked food (remaining after agnaukarana) mixed with sesamum (vide Yāj. I. 242). If pindas were to be offered after the brāhmanas took their dinner, the pindas were to be made from the remainder of the food cooked for the brāhmaṇas which was to be mixed with the boiled rice for agnaukaraña as stated in Kātyāyana&rsquo;s Srāddha sūtra 1075 The pindas were to be placed according to the Matsya 1076 on darbhas spread on the ground cleaned with water mixed with cow&rsquo;s dung and urine. There were others such as Devala, the Brahmapurāņa and Bhavisyapurāna that prescribed that an altar, either circular or square, of sand was to be raised on ground 4 fingers in height and one cubit in extent near the plates from which brāhmaṇas were to eat and thereon darbhas</p>

S. II. 32) 1078 and the repetition of three mantras when each of the three pindas is offered, some holding that the seasons were to be deemed as identified with &lsquo;rasa&rsquo;, sosa&rsquo; and four other words (in Vaj. S. II. 32), while others held that the adoration of the seasons is quite distinct from the namaskāras to the pitrs. In the Saunakātharvanaśrāddha-kalpa, the pindas are offered in the reverse order i. e. first to the great-grand father, then to the grandfather and then to the father (Hemādri on śrāddha p. 1442).

<p>About the final disposal (pratipatti) of the pipdas several views were entertained. We have already seen (note 780 ) that the Vāj. S. and several sūtras provided that the middle one of the three pindas for paternal ancestors was to be eaten by the wife of the performer of the śrāddha if she was desirous of a son. Manu (III. 262-263) provides that the dharmapatni (i. e, a wife of the same varpa and married before any other wife ) should eat the middle pinda with the mantra &lsquo;ādhatta pitaro garbham&rsquo; (q. in n. 780) and then she gives birth to a son who lives long, secures fame, is intelligent and obtains wealth and progeny and who is of a good and righteous turn of mind. The same rule is provided for by the Laghu-Ašvalāyana 23.83, the Kūrma II. 2. 71, 76, Matsya 16,52, Vāyu 76,31, Vişnudharmottara I. 1718, 220, 149, Padma (srstikhanda 9.121) and other purāņas. As regards pindas in general, the Āśv. Sr. (11. 7. 14-17) says that the other two pindas (except the middle one ) should be cast into water or in fire or they may be eaten by a brāhmana who has suddenly developed a distaste for food or they may be partaken by one who has been suffering from a serious disease (such as tuberculosis or leprosy ) and that in the latter case the man either recovers or dies. The Gobhila-gr. (IV. 3, 31-34) provides that the pindas should be thrown into water or in fire or should be given to a brāhmaṇa or a cow to eat. Manu (III. 260-261 ) says the same and adds that they may be given to a goat for eating and that some allow them to be devoured by birds. Yāj. I. 257, Matsya 16.52-53, and Padma1079 mention the same five ways of disposal but the last adds one more viz. placing them near a mound of earth. The Varaha purāņa 1080 (190.121 ) says that the performer may eat the first pinda himself, he should give the middle to his wife and the third he should cast into water. The Anušāsanaparva (125.25.26) provides that the first and the third should be thrown into water or fire and the middle pinda should be eaten by the wife. It is provided by Bịhaspati that if the wife is suffering from a disease or is already pregnant or is staying in some other</p>

<p>place, then an old bull or a goat may eat the middle pinda (quoted by Sm. C. on Sr. p. 486, Kalpataru on Śr. p. 224). The Vişnudharmottara (I. 141, 8) prescribes that when a śrāddha is performed at a tirtha, the pindas should be cast into the sacred water. The Anušāsanaparva 125. 38-40 and some of the purānas such as Vāyu (76.32-34 ) and Brahma (220.150–152) provide that certain consequences follow from the disposal of pindas in one way or another viz. the best worlds by giving pindas to cows, intellect and fame from casting into water, long life from offering them to birds &amp;c. Vide also Brahmānda (upodghāta, chap. 12. 31-35) which provides that if given to cows the result is best complexion, if to cocks then delicacy. long life if given crows. In this connection it should be noted that pindas of rice or of flour were not to be offered in all śrāddhas. The Śrāddha-kalpalatā (pp. 86-89 ) has a long discussion about the śrāddhas in which the offering of pindas of food is forbidden. For example, it quotes Pulastya to the effect that in śrāddhas performed on the two ayana days, on the two equinoctial days, on any sankrānti, no pindas are to be offered, so also in śrāddhas on Ekādasi, Trayodasi, on Maghā and Krttikā nakşatras, if a man desires to have sons and wealth.</p>
<p>On the question as to what is the principal item in the śrāddha there are three views. Some, like Govindaraja, 1081 hold that feeding of brāhmaṇas is the principal thing and they rely on Manu III. 129 which says &lsquo;One may feed even a single learned brāhmaṇa in a rite for gods and manes and not many who do not know vedic mantras; by doing so he reaps abundant reward&rsquo;. Here the reward or fruit is associated with feeding a learned brāhmaṇa. There is a maxim 1082 of the Pürvamimāṁsā that whatever is mentioned in proximity with an action that has a reward or fruit but has no special reward of its own, is subsidiary (anga) to what is declared to have a reward.&rsquo; Besides, there is no pindadāna in certain śrāddhas such as āmasrāddha, śrāddha on the Yugādi days.1083</p>

<p>Others like Karka hold the view that pindadāna is the principal item in śrāddha. They rely upon the fact that in the śrāddha at Gayā it is the offering of pindas that is the most important matter and upon the fact that in the Visnudharmasūtra (78. 52-53, and 85. 65-66) and in several Purānas such as the Varāha (13.50), Visnu (III. 14.22-23), Brahma (220.31-32), Visnu dharmottara (I. 145.3-4) the pitrs are stated to have expressed a deep yearning for a son who would offer them pindas at Gayā and water on sacred rivers &amp;c. (vide note 911). Further support is sought for this view in the fact that in the śrāddha on the birth of a son and in śrāddha offered even by a good Śūdra the feeding of brāhmanas is forbidden, A third view is that both the feeding of brähmanas and the offering of pindas are the principal matters in a śräddha. The Gobhila-smrti, after stating 1084 the other two views and some of the reasons therefor, tells us that the author of it is himself in favour of this third view. In cases where the word śrāddha is employed and there is neither brāhmana feeding nor pindadāna as in Daiva srāddha, the word śrāddha is applied in a secondary sense (gauna). Vide Hemādri (śraddha) pp. 157-160. In the Dharmapradipa it is said that among the followers of the Yajurveda (i. e. Vājasaneyins) the offering of pindas is principal, among the followers of the Rgveda the feeding of brāhmaṇas is principal, while among the followers of the Sāmaveda both are principal. In this way śrāddha partakes of two characters viz. it is a yāga (sacrifice) and also 1085 a gift (dāna). Haradatta, Hemādri, Kapardi and others appear to hold that all three (bhojana pindadāna and agnaukaraña) are principal. Vide Samskära ratnamālā p. 1003.</p>

<p>the hand of the performer of śrāddha); the father, (the grand-father and great-grandfather) are entitled to the piņda; the offerer of the pinda is the 7th; thus sapinda relationship extends to seven generations 1086 The Mārkandeya-purāpa states that three ancestors beginning from the paternal grand father of the paternal grandfather enjoy the wipings (of the hand of the performer when he offers pindas). 1087 The Brahma purāņa (220. 84-86) has similar verses. Manu provided 1088 that the performer should place three pindas on darbhas and then wipe off from his hand the particles of food and water sticking to it with the roots of the darbhas (on which the pindas were placed) and that such wipings are meant for those who are called &rsquo;lepabhāgin&rsquo; (the three paternal ancestors after the paternal great-grand-father). Similar provisions are made by the Visņu Dh. S. 73.22, Varāhapurāņa 14,36, Garudapurāņa (Acārakānda 218.24), Kūrma II. 22.52. Medhātithi on Manu III. 216 says that even if no food or water sticks to the hand still the performer rubs the hand against the roots of the dar bhas on which the first pinda was placed. A special rule was provided by Devala quoted in Srāddhakalpalatā (p. 14) that if the father or mother became a mleccha (by forcible or volun tary conversion &amp;c.) one should not observe any impurity for him or her and no śrāddha should be offered and when offering the three pindas in place of the father the name of Visņu should be uttered.</p>
<p>&lsquo;One question that exercised the minds of well-known writers was whether the daily Vaišvadeva should be performed before starting the bräddha ceremonies or after the latter were finished.

<p>gods 1089. Manu (III. 265 ) states 1090 that after the brāhmanan have been dismissed the performer of śrāddha shall offer the (daily) domestic bali offering and that this is the settled rule of dharma. Medhātithi explains that the word &lsquo;bali&rsquo; is merely illustrative. The Matsyapurāņa 1091 17.61, the Varāha purāna (14.43), Skanda VII. 1. 266. 101-102, Devala, Kārsnājini and others provide that after the rites for the fathers are finished Vaisvadeva should be performed. When Vaišvadeva is performed after the completion of śrāddha rites, it is to be offered from the food that remains after being utilized for the śrāddha dinner. But Hemādri (pp. 1058-1065) holds a long discussion and arrives at the following conclusions. In the case of an āhitāgni (p. 1064), Vaišvadeva is to be performed before śrāddha except in the case of the śrāddha on the 11th day after death. In the case of one who has not kept the sacred fires there are three optional times for Vaišvadeva, viz. after agnau karaṇa or after the vikira (scattering of food on darbhas for those dying without the sařskāras being performed for them), or after the brāhmanas are dismissed on the completion of the śrāddha (p. 1064). If Vaišvadeva is to be performed before śrāddha or in the midst of it, then the cooking of food must be done separately for Vaišvadeva and for śrāddha. In the case of all, whether sāgnika or anagnika, Vaišvadeva must be performed with the remainder of the food left after use in śrāddha, if the former is performed after the latter. There were sages like Paithīnasi1092 that held that Vaišvadeva should not be performed with the food cooked for sraddha without first offering the food to the brāhmanas invited for srādda dinner i. e. Vaišvadeva must be performed after śrāddha if the same food is to be used</p>

<p>for the former. The Nirpayasindhu (III. p. 459 ) states that as most smrtis place the performance of Vaišvadeva after śrāddha and as many writers of commentaries and digests such as Medhātithi and Smộtiratnāvali do the same all should perform Vaišvadeva after finishing śräddha.</p>
<p>It is now necessary to illustrate how pārvana srāddha is performed in modern times. Here the greatest variety prevails. The details of the rite vary in the different parts of India. They vary also according as the performer belongs to a particular Veda or a particular recension of the Veda, they vary according to the particular eminent writer that is followed and further additions are made according as the performer is a Vaispava or a Saiva. Such differences have to be passed over here, particularly because they are not material. We saw above that the Pārvana-śrāddha was very simple in the days of the Brāhmaṇas and most of the sūtras. There was then no express mention of the worship of Viśvedevāḥ in Pārvana śrāddha, or of the maternal ancestors or of the wives of any ancestors. Gradually these came to be added and by the time of the Yājñavalkyasmrti there was special invocation of the Viśvedevāḥ. But these latter were probably not expressly divided into groups at the time of that work. During the smrti period groups of Viśvedevāḥ came to be assigned to different kinds of śräddhas (vide p. 457 note 1018). The Puräpas pres cribed several Paurānic mantras for being recited during the śrāddha rite, such as the verse Sāgacchantu&rsquo; (note 984) and the verse &lsquo;devatābhyah pitrbhyasca&rsquo; (p. 458 note 1020). Then there arose the principle of the Pūrvamiņāmsā that all rites described in the different sākhās and sūtras constitute but one rite, and that one may take over from another sākhā or sūtra details described therein, which are not opposed to one&rsquo;s own sākhā or sutra (vide pp. 453-55 notes 1011-1013). This principle tended to make the śräddha rites all inclusive and the whole procedure became swollen to an enormous extent. How even the slightest variation causes difference in the details may be illustrated by an example. In Mithilā villages even among poor men eleven brāhmaṇas are invited for pārvapa-śrāddha, but it is often difficult to secure a very learned man (who is called pātra or mahāpātra) to officiate. In such a case where a mahapatra or a pātra brāhmana is not available the śrāddha be called apātraka-pārvanaśräddha (for which really there is nouśastric authority) and is distinguished from the sapātraka pārvana śrāddha in several matters, two of which in the case of the</p>

<p>Vājasaneyins may be stated here. Though the Śrāddhasūtra of Kātyāyana, which is of special authority among Vājasaneyins, declares (at the end of kandikā III) that the brāhmaṇas are to be dismissed at the end of the śrāddha with the verse &lsquo;Vāje vāje&rsquo; (Vāj. S. 9.18) and the performer should circumambulate the brāhmanas with the mantra &lsquo;ā mā vājasya&rsquo; (Vaj. S. 9. 19), it is not the practice among the sistas in Mithilā according to the editor of the Srāddharatna to observe these directions in what is called &lsquo;apătraka-pārvana-śrāddha&rsquo; in these days. In Rudradhara&rsquo;s Srāddhaviveka (pp. 138-146) the apātraka pārvana-śräddha-prayoga&rsquo; is set out at length.</p>
<p>In medieval and modern times in the different provinces of India different manuals are followed by the followers of the several Vedas. For example, in Bengal the Sāmavedins, Yajurvedins and Rgvedins follow the procedure of pārvana śrāddha laid down in the manuals (or paddhatis) of Bhavadeva, Pasupati and Kālesi respectively and there are many persons who follow the rules laid down by Raghunandana in his Śrāddhatattva and Yajurvediśrāddha-tattva In Mithilā, Śrīdatta wrote his Pitřbhakti for Yajurvedins and the Srāddha kalpa for Sāmavedins and the Srāddha-ratna of Mahāmaho pādhyāya Laksmīpati (between 1500 to 1640 A. D.) which is printed at Darbhanga and claims to be the traditional manual for Maithilas (Maithila-sämpradāyika-śrāddhapaddhati) in several places says that it follows the Sugatisopāna of Prati hastaka for Chandogas and also for Vājasaneyins. In the Madras State Vaisnava brāhmaṇas follow special treatises on Pūrva and Apara kriyās of Vaidika-Sārvabhauma or Harita Venkatācārya or Tolappar and Smarta brähmaņas follow the Smrtimuktāphala of Vaidyanātha, which does not much differ in major matters from the works of Vaidikasārvabhauma, Often the only differences are in the sankalpa and at the end. It is impossible to exhibit in this work the contents of all these manuals and to compare and contrast them. Therefore I shall set out here a model pārvanaśrāddha rite as performed by Revedios in Western India and then a Sukla Yajurveda rite, The Pratisāmvatsarika śrāddha 93 rite for Rgvedins in</p>

Then he puts yava grains into the two arghya vessels for daiva brāhmanas with the mantra &lsquo;Yavosi dhānyarājo vā&rsquo; (note 985 ) and also sandalwood paste, flowers, basil leaf and performs obeisance. He says &ldquo;May all the upacaras be completed by means of yavas; the two arghya vessels for daiva brāhmanas are fully ready&rsquo;. The response is</p>
<p>susampanne&rsquo;. He says &lsquo;svāhā, these are arghya waters&rsquo;. The response is &rsquo;let there be arghya waters&rsquo;. Placing his left hand in which he holds kuģas and yava grains on the right knee of the daiva brāhmana and holding in his (right) hand yava grains he says ‘Ishall invoke the Viśve devas called Purūrava and Ardrava to be present in you&rsquo;. They respond&rsquo; do invoke&rsquo;. He invokes the Viśve-devas with the mantra viśve devāsa&rsquo; (Rg. II. 47.13) separately repeated as regards each daiva brāhmaṇa. He says, &lsquo;I invoke the Viśve devas with the mantra</p>
<p>visve devāh śrnutemām (Rg. VI. 52.13). Having invoked Vißve devas he casts the remaining yaya grains on the ground near the feet of the daiva brāhmaṇas. Then he gives water to them (daiva brāhmanas) and he puts in their hands the darbhas placed over the arghya vessels; he says &lsquo;O Viśve devas called Purūrava and Ārdrava! this is arghya water for you; svāhā, adoration. They respond let there be arghya&rsquo;. Repeating the mantra &lsquo;yā divyā āpah&rsquo; (vide Äsv. Gr.

Let there be good worship in the rite of worship; May that which is wanting or is excessive be according to prescribed rules&rsquo;. The brāhmaṇas respond &lsquo;astu vidhivat&rsquo; and the per former recites the verse &lsquo;I do obeisance to Acyuta by remem bering whom or by uttering whose name whatever is wanting in tapas (observances) or sacrifices becomes at once perfect&rsquo;.</p>

So saying he offers double-folded darbhas with sesamum grains to the pitrya brāhmaṇas who reply &lsquo;svāsanam&rsquo;. Then follows the same procedure as regards pitrya brāhmanas which has been already set out as to daiva brāhmaṇas. The only difference is that instead of two darbhas three darbhas are spread on the ground with their tips towards the south, three vessels are placed towards south-east with faces down wards and three double-folded darbhas are placed on each of the three vessels, instead of &lsquo;yavosi&rsquo; the mantra is tilosi somadevatyaḥ&rsquo; (vide note 966) and instead of &lsquo;svāhā namah the words &ldquo;svadhā namaḥ&rsquo; are employed, and instead of tulasi leaf bhrngarāja leaf is employed. In āvāhana the per former places his left hand holding kusas and sesame on the left knee of the pitrya brāhmana and the verse repeated is &lsquo;usantas tvā&rsquo; (Rg. X. 16. 12) as to each pitrya brāhmaṇa and he should honour the pitrs by repeating one mantra &lsquo;ā yantu nah&rsquo; (Vāj. S. 19. 58). He offers arghya 1103 water with the right hand supported by the left to the father and the other two paternal ancestors. Ho brings together the samsravas 1104 in the first pitrya vessel and anoints his face with that water if he desires a son. The brāhmaṇas respond &lsquo;may you have a son&rsquo;.</p>

Just as Visnu renders ineffective the eyes of all men of evil sight, so one should make a mandala with ashes and when this is done there is no blemish in sitting in the same row for dining. Then the purification of the hand (right) of the brāhmaṇas is done, beginning with the pitrya brāhmaṇa first.

<p>and having held his breathi according to his ability he should return to the original position and utter the words &rsquo;the Fathers regaled themselves and came like bulls, each to his share&rsquo; and having smelt the remains of the boiled rice from which pindas are made from the left side (to the right ) he should cast the pindas (on the darbhas ) and should partake of the boiled rice by taking in as much steam and flavour out of it as he can by smelling it. He should say &lsquo;my father! N. N. by name, so and so by gotra, apply unctuous substance&rsquo;; with these words he should anoint the pindas by means of darbhas with ghee or sesamum oil. And he should apply collyrium to the pindas with the words &lsquo;O father! N. N. by name and so and so by gotra apply collyrium&rsquo;. He should put on the pindas unctuous subst ance, collyrium and garment, 1118 the last being the fringe of a garment or a tuft of wool with the words &ldquo;O fathers ! this is the garment for you, do not take up any other (garment ) than this&rsquo;. Then savyam. He then says &ldquo;I shall offer worship to the pindas for the prosperity of my family&rsquo;. He then offers to the pitrs present in the piņdas pādya, arghya, water for ācamana, bath, gandha, flowers, bhrngarāja leaf, incense, lamp and naivedya of apūpa (cakes) and pāyasa (rice cooked in milk), tāmbūla and dakşiņā, using the word &lsquo;svadhā&rsquo; after each of them. Then he should worship 1119 them with the mantra &lsquo;Fathers! obeisance to you for the sake of food, for strength, for susma, for the non-terrible (aghora), for jīva, for rasa; svadhā to you, O pitrs, obeisance to you; these are yours, Opitrs ! these are ours; we are your living (descendants), may we be alive here&rsquo;l He then recites the verses 1120 Rg.

Having thus worshipped them he then (apasavyam) with the palm of the hand turned upwards moves the pindas with the mantra 1121 paretana&rsquo; which means &lsquo;O fathers who love soma</p>

<p>Then savyam. On the ground near the plates of the Vaišva deva brāhmaṇas he scatters food together with yavas and water with the verse &lsquo;I shall offer food scattered (vikira) near the Vaiśvadeva brāhmaṇas to those gods to whom no soma drink is offered and who are bereft of a share in sacrifices; this scattered food is offered to Viśvedevas who do not partake of the soma drink; it is not (now) mine&rsquo;. Then apasavyam. He says &lsquo;I shall offer food scattered near pitrya brāhmaṇas on the ground covered with darbhas to those who died without the saņskāras being performed for them and to those women of my family who left the family (for bad deeds); this scattered food is presented to those boys and girls that came out of the womb; it is not mine&rsquo;. So saying he strews food with water and sesamum seeds and then says after reciting Rg. X. 15.14 &rsquo;this pinda made from the remainder of the food and occupying the position that a pinda given at Gayā occupies, has been offered to those persons who were born in my family and died and who were cremated or were not cremated; this is not mine. So saying he offers near the pitrya brāhmaṇas a ball of rice and water mixed with sesamum grains,</p>
<p>Then he washes his hands and feet, sips water twice and puts on his finger a pavitra with the mantra &lsquo;pavitravantah&rsquo; (Rg. IX. 73. 3). He then requests that the water in the hands of the daiva brāhmaṇas be auspicious (or beneficial). The brāhmaṇas reply &lsquo;may the waters be auspicious.&rsquo; In the same way there are requests for goodwill, for protection due to yavas, for long life, welfare, peace, prosperity, contentment and responses by the daiva brāhmaṇas giving blessings as to these. Then apasavyam. Then the same request for auspiciousness of waters, goodwill. protection by sesamum grains &amp;c. and blessings about them by pitrya brāhmaṇas.

The same request is made to the daiva brāhmanas and the reply is the same. Then gold is given to the daiva brāhmaṇas and silver to pitrya brāhmaṇas and the performer says &lsquo;may the daksipās (fees) given to the brahmanas that ate the srāddha dinner protect (me).&rsquo; They reply &lsquo;may they do so.&rsquo; Then he says &lsquo;I shall request you to utter the word svadhā!&rsquo; They reply &lsquo;do so.&rsquo; Then apasavyam.

Then he says ‘May you declare that svadhā be accomplished.&rsquo; They reply &lsquo;may svadhā be accomplished.&rsquo; Then savyam. Then he says &lsquo;may you say that the gods led by Agni be pleased.&rsquo; They reply &lsquo;may the Viśvedevāḥ be pleased.&rsquo; Then apasavyam.

<p>May there be accomplishment of the sankalpa&rsquo;. He asks were the vegetables and cooked food liked by the pitrs&rsquo;. They reply they were most excellent&rsquo;. Then the performer decks himself by applying sandal paste to his forehead. After doing obeisance to the piņdas he requests for blessings for his family (which are the same as those set out above from the Padma puräna on p.452 above) and one more blessing &lsquo;May persons beg of us but may we not beg of any one&rsquo; (vide n. 998). The brāhmaṇas reply in the same words only employing the words &lsquo;you&rsquo; or &lsquo;your&rsquo; for &lsquo;us&rsquo; or &lsquo;our &lsquo;.</p>
<p>He says &ldquo;I shall remove the pindas&rsquo;. They reply do remove&rsquo;. Then he repeats the verses Tad Vispoh&rsquo; (Rg. I. 22.20 ), Tad viprāso&rsquo; (Rg.

<p>remove the plates in which the brāhmaṇas had their dinner.&rsquo; Then he lays aside the kūrca. He then recites the verse</p>
<p>Vāje vāje&rsquo; (Rg. VII, 38,8). Then savyam. Then he says &lsquo;O pitrs, get up together with the devas&rsquo; and repeats the verses &lsquo;ā mā vājasya&rsquo; (Vāj. S. 9. 19), &lsquo;svādusansadah&rsquo; (Rg. VI. 75. 9), &ldquo;brāhmanāsah pitarah&rsquo; (Rg. VI, 75. 10), &lsquo;ihaiva stam&rsquo; (Rg. X. 85. 42). Then he recites &lsquo;may the grand fathers being pleased grant to men (their descendants ) long life, progeny, wealth, learning, heaven, mokşa, happiness and kingdom&rsquo; (Yāj. I. 270, but reads &ldquo;prayacchantu&rsquo; for &lsquo;prayac chanti&rsquo;). Then he prays &lsquo;May these blessings turn out to be true, may my family prosper, may this Pratisäinvatsarika śrāddha have the same fruits as that of a śrāddha performed at Gayā! May the pitrs secure inexhaustible gratification.&rsquo; Then he proceeds &lsquo;Today my birth has had its reward by bowing to your feet &amp;c.&rsquo; (vide n. 999 for the two verses repeated here ). The brāhmaṇas reply we forget the trouble and excuse you.&rsquo; Then he says &lsquo;Today this tithi is like a day sacred to the sun; the brāhmanas invited are like Vyāsa, Vasistha and Vāmadeva; may you declare that whatever is lacking as regards seats, dinner, mantras, procedure, materials and fees in this prati sāmvatsarika śrāddha of my pitrs performed by me today be come all perfect at the words of brāhmaṇas&rsquo;. They reply May all be perfect&rsquo;. Then he recites the two verses &ldquo;Vasist hāsaḥ pitřvad&rsquo; and &lsquo;devān vasiştho&rsquo; (Rg. X. 66. 14-15) and then at the end he repeats the verse containing a salutation (the word &rsquo;namah&rsquo;) viz. &lsquo;idam pitřbhyo namo astvadya&rsquo; (Rg. X. 15. 2). Therefore at the end (of a śrāddha rite) one does obeisance to the pitrs (in the words &rsquo;namo vaḥ pitaro &amp;c.&rsquo;). Therefore they say “should one repeat the pitryā verses with āhāva mantra specially recited with each verse or without repeating the āhāva mantra separately with each verse; for it is better not to finish Pitryajña quickly. He who separately recites the āhāva with each verse makes the pitryajña that is imperfect, complete and therefore one must recite specially employing the āhāva with each verse.&ldquo;1123 The conclusion is</p>

<p>one should repeat each verse with āhāva separately uttered. The performer should follow the brāhmanas up to the boundary of the village). He says &lsquo;whatever blemish there may be in japa, tapas or śrāddha rite&ndash;may all that become free from blemish by the favour of brāhmaṇas. I do adora tion to that Acyuta (Visnu) by remembering whom &amp;c. O best of brāhmaṇas! may this śrāddha, even if devoid of mantras, or of some rite or of faith, become perfect by your favour&rsquo;. Then he concludes &ldquo;May Janārdana Vasudeva who assumes the forms of father, grand-father and great-grand father be pleased by this sacrifice, viz. the pratisāmvatsarika śrāddha of the pitrs. This is a sacrifice to the manes. Tat sat. May it be dedicated to Brahma.&rsquo; Then he repeats the verse * Vaşat te&rsquo; (Rg. VII. 99.7) and then says &lsquo;adoration to Vişnu (Vişņave namah) thrice and sips water twice. The fruit of offering piņdas is stated by Bphaspati and Vrddha-Parāśara as follows: If the pitrs are in the world of gods they are grati fied by the food offered in fire, if they are in the world of pitrs they are gratified by the dinner to brāhmaṇas and if in hell they are gratified by the balls offered on the ground, 1123a</p>
<p>Comparing the above rather elaborate and exhaustive procedure with the procedure of pratisāmvatsarikaśräddha as</p>
<p>(Continued from the last page) verse &lsquo;devānām patnir&rsquo; (Rg. V. 46. 6) or the rk verse referring to Rākā should be recited first in the surfar asta in gai hia. The conclusion reached is that the verse referring to aagcars should be recited first by the EIA. In the same context a question is raised whether the Yāmī verse (Rg. X, 14,4 &lsquo;Imam yama prastaram&rsquo;) or the Pitryā verses (Rg. X. 15.1-3) should be recited first. The conclusion is that the rat verse should be first recited, then the Kavya verse (Rg. X. 14. 3 &lsquo;Matali kavyair&rsquo;) and then the pitrya verses, out of which Rg. X. 15.2 (Eg fûqxu 31a) is recited last in which the word नमः occurs. आहाव means the mantra शोसावोम, The figure 3 is a sign of the wa accent. The sign of wa shows deliberation, TE:-we have to understand garga: as the subject. Then comes the question whether the stera should be recited at the beginning of each of the three pitryā verses or not. The conclusion is that the 3TER should be recited at the beginning of each of the three pitryā verses. Apparently it is rather difficult to say why this passage of the datater should occur in this TUTT. The only reason appears to be that the . a. passage has something to say about fags and hence as this is a ty for fuas it ts introduced here:</p>

The Pāryanaśrāddha-prayoga in Halāyudha&rsquo;s Brāhmanasarvasva closely follows Kātyāyana and I am assured by a careful student of Dharmaśāstra that the pro cedure of pārvanaśrāddha followed by Madhyandinas at Bhat para in Western Bengal is in strict conformity with the proce dure laid down by Raghunandana. The Śrāddhasūtra of Kātyāyana is translated here with some explanations and additions made by Halāyudha and Raghunandana and the whole text, being not very extensive, is given in the note below1124.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The pārvaņa-śrāddha is preceded by the rite for Višve devas. The procedure follows that of Pindapitryajña 1124a. In the rites for the pitrs double-folded darbhas are to be used (while in Vaišvadevika rite straight darbhas are used). Whenever any thing is to be gifted, the performer (in all daiva as well as pitrya rites ) wears a pavitra and makes the gift sitting. (When questions are to be asked the performer puts the question to the most eminent in the row of diners (to the best daiva brāhmana in daiva rites and to the best pitrya brāhmaṇa in pitrya rites) or he may put the question to all (and the reply is given by one or by all). Spreading darbhas on the seats (he makes the brahmanas occupy them), he puts the question &lsquo;shal] I invoke the Visvedevas (to the daiva brāhmana)&rsquo;. Being permitted (by the daiva brahmanas) in the words &lsquo;do invoke&rsquo;, he invokes the Visvedevas with the mantra 1125 Visve devāsa āgata&rsquo; (Vāj. S. 7. 34 &lsquo;Ye All Gods, come, listen to this my call and sit down on this darbha grass &lsquo;). Then he scatters yavas (in front of the brāhmaṇas), mutters a mantra Viśvedevāḥ srunutemam&rsquo; (Vaj. S. 33. 53, &lsquo;Ye All Gods, hear this call of mine&rsquo;). After this japa he asks (the pitrya brāhmaṇas) &lsquo;I shall invoke the pitrs&rsquo;. When permitted (by the pitrya brah manas) in the words do invoke&rsquo;, he invokes them with the mantra &lsquo;usantas tva.&rsquo; (Vaj. S. 19, 70, &lsquo;O Agni! we longing for our fathers place you down&rsquo; &amp;c.). Then he scatters (sesamum</p>

(He keeps some food aside for making piņdas later on). Then (having served the food in the plates ) he plunges the thumb of the brāhmapas in the food with a řk (Rg.

Then he should serve hot food very much liked (by diners or by the departed) or he may serve such food as he can afford. While the brāhmaṇas are engaged in eating (the dinner) he should perform japa of the follow ing 1131, viz, the sacred Gāyatri once or thrice preceded by om and the vyāhrtis, the verses called Rāksoghni (note 1111 ), mantras addressed to the pitřs (Rg.

Then finding that the brāh maņas are satiated with food, he should scatter some food in front of the dining brāhmanas, he should give to each brāh mana water once (for aposana at the end of dinner). Then he should mutter as before the Gāyatri, the (three) Madhumati verses (Rg. I. 90. 6-8) and the word &lsquo;madhu&rsquo; (thrice). Then he asks are you satiated&rsquo;. Being permitted by them in the words &lsquo;we are satiated&rsquo;, he makes them give their consent as to the rest of the food, collects together all food in one vessel (in order to make piņdas from it); he offers (two sets of three pindas, three for paternal ancestors and three for maternal ancestors) on darbhas near the spot where 1132 the brāhmaṇas dined and left uneaten food in plates and pours water over the pindas for ablution 1133.

<p>Pārvanaśrāddha in Bengal</p>
<p>509</p>
<p>It is to be noted that in the Bengal Manual of Pārvana śrāddha based on the Brāhmanasarvasva of Halāyudha and also on Raghunandana&rsquo;s Yajurvedi-śrāddhatattva the following details are added after the pindas are placed on the darbhas and before the dismissal of the brāhmaṇas. He turns towards the north and says &lsquo;O pitrs, regale yourselves here and come like bulls each to his portion.&rsquo; Then he turns round to his former position and says &rsquo;the pitrs regaled themselves and came like bulls each to his own share.&rsquo; Then he loosens 1135 the side of his dhoti which has been tucked up and then folds up his hands (i. e. offers six namaskāras) with the mantra 1136 &lsquo;Namo vaḥ pitaro rasāya&rsquo; (Vāj. S. I. 32). He smells 1137 the pindas and gives the middle one to his wife, if she desires a son, with the mantra &lsquo;&lsquo;ādhatta&rsquo; (Vaj. S. II. 33).</p>
<p>From considerations of space the procedure of pārvaņa śrāddha among Hiranyakeśins in modern times is passed over here. Moreover, it closely resembles the procedure in Āśv. Gr. set out above, the principal difference being that some of the mantras are different. The Samskäraratnamālā of Gopinātha deals with this from p. 985 onwards. But one noticeable feature of this last work is that of making hair-splitting distinctions. On p. 985 it refers to two śrāddhas (other than pinda-pitr yajña) to be performed on amāvāsyā, viz. māsi-śrūddha and māsika-śrāddha, the first being described by the Dharmasutra of Hiranyakesin and the second by the Gshyasūtra. Gopinātha further says that māsikaśraddha is the model of the other śrāddhas described in the Grhyasūtra and māsisraddha is the model of śrāddhas described in the Dharmaśāstras, such as Mahālayaśräddha or Samvatsarika-śrāddha, that Darśaśrāddha itself is māsi-śrāddha (p. 988) and that māsika-śrāddha may be performed on each darśa or on any one darśa day in a year and that māsi-śrāddha follows immediately after Pindapitryajña as</p>

<p>laid down by Manu (III. 122) and māsikaśrāddha may be per formed after māsi-śrāddha. In modern times no one performs māsiśrāddha or māsika-śrāddha strictly in accordance with the ancient rules. Srāddha is supposed to be performed by feeding a brāhmaṇa and giving him a dakşiņā of a few annas. The Srāddhatattva (Jiv., part 1 p. 254) provides, after quoting Matsya and Bhavisya, that, if a person is unable to perform a pārvanaśrāddha every month, he should perform one at least thrice a year when the sun is in the zodiacal signs of Kanyā, Kumbha and Vrsabha and that if he is unable to perform even thrice then he should perform at least once when the sun is in the sign of Kanyā.</p>
<p>The two meanings of sapiņda given by the Mit, and the Dāyabhāga have already been explained at great length in H. of Dh. vol. II, pp. 452-458 and pp. 472-477. The Dāyabhāga pro pounded the theory that whoever conferred greater spiritual benefit on the deceased by the performance of śrāddhas and the offering of pindas was entitled to be preferred as an heir to the deceased&rsquo;s wealth. The Mit. said that heirship depended on blood relationship and the nearest in blood to the deceased was the preferential heir. But even under the Mit. whoever took the wealth of the deceased was bound to pay his debts (Yaj. II, 51 ) and to offer śrāddha and pinda to him. This subject and the several propositions deduced from the texts have been dealt with in H. of Dh. vol. III, pp. 734-745.</p>
<p>One thing to be remembered is that in determining the preferential right regard is to be had to the capacity of a per son and the efficacy of the pindas when offered. After a person takes the wealth of the deceased, there is no legal machinery to enforce his duty to offer pindas 1138 It was argued in Nalinaksha v. Rajani Kanto 35 C. W. N. 726 that, if an heir does not offer pindas or refuses to offer them to his ancestor. he was not entitled under Hindu Law to succeed to him. This argument was repelled by the judges with the remark that there was no authority for such a proposition and that the right to inheritance is based under the Dāyabhāga not on offering pinda but on the capacity to offer it (p. 729). Vide Gooroo Gobinda Saha v. Anand Lal 5 Beng. L. R. 15 (F. B.) and Digambers Motilal 9 Cal. 563 (F. B.) for the statement that the principle of spiritual benefit is the sole foundation of the theory of in.nl</p>

<p>heritance propounded in the Dāyabhāga. But in certain later cases such as Akshayachandra v. Hari Das 35 Cal, 721 it was rightly pointed out that spiritual benefit is not always the guiding principle under the Bengal school of law, that the principle of spiritual efficacy as the guiding principle fails in all classes of female relations such as the wife, the daughter and the mother whose rights are really based on special texts and that the reason for inheritance by a re-united coparcener was not spiritual benefit but was based on a quasi contract and affection</p>
<p>The question about how śrāddha was to be performed if one or more of the three paternal ancestors were alive engaged the thoughts of writers from very ancient times. The Āśv. 1139 Śr. S. (II. 6. 16-23) first sets out the views of Gāņagāri, Taulvali and Gautama and then refutes them. Gā pagāri held that out of the three paternal ancestors pindas should be offered to those that were dead and those that were alive should be honoured in person, since the śräddha rite is meant for pleasing the ancestors; Tau)vali opined that pindas should be offered to all the three ancestors, whether living or dead, since in the rite of śrāddha they are only a secondary matter (a detail). Gautama thought that pindas should be offered to dead ancestors, upto three from the father if the latter was living, from the grand father if he was alive and from the great-grandfather if all the three be living. Āśv. replies; one cannot offer pindas to three ancestors 1110 beyond the father, grand-father or great grandfather, since one has no adhikära to do so; one cannot offer pindas to an ancestor after whom there is an ancestor (within three degrees) living. One may offer homa into fire to those that are alive. (If all three ancestors are alive ) all the three pindas must be cast into fire or he may not begin the rite at all.

<p>that pindas are offered only to deceased ancestors; therefore if a person&rsquo;s father be alive or if there is a deceased ancestor between whom and the performer there is an ancestor that is alive, then one whose father is alive can only perform homa (into fire, but no pindadāna) or he should not undertake at all (the rite of pinda-pitryajña or pārvanaśrāddha); that Jātākarnya prescribes that no pindadāna is possible when a living ancestor (father) intervenes between the performer and a deceased ancestor, since a śruti text says &lsquo;one does not offer pindas to ancestors that are beyond a living ancestor.&rsquo; Manu (III. 220-222 ) deals with this question as follows: If the performer&rsquo;s father be alive he should offer pindas to three ancestors begin ning from the paternal grand-father or he may request the father to dinner as he would do to a stranger brāhmaṇa and offer pindas to the deceased grand-father and great-grand-father, If the father be dead and the grandfather be alive, he may offer a pinda only to the father and the great-grandfather (i. e. only two pindas) or the grand-father who is alive may be invited to dinner as if he were the stranger brāhmana invited to represent a deceased grand-father or if permitted by the grandfather who is alive he may offer pindas to father, great-grandfather and great great-grandfather. The Visnudharmasūtra (chap. 75) has several rules of a similar character. Some of the Purānas such as Skanda VI 225.24-25, Agni 117,58-59 deal with this matter. Gobhilasmrti (II. 93 ff) has a long passage on this question, one verse of which is quoted below. 1142 Many of the commentaries and digests hold divergent views on this subject, viz. the Mit. on Yāj. I. 254, Kalpataru (śr. pp. 240 ff), Śr. K. K. pp. 552-556 and Nirnayasindhu (III, pp. 499-503 ). It is impossible to reconcile all the views. The Kalpataru (on śr. p. 240) states that there are three alternative courses for him whose father is alive; (1) he should pass over the father that is alive and offer pindas to those three ancestors to whom his father offers pindas: (Manu. III, 220, Visņu Dh. S. 75.1); (2) he should simply offer homa into fire as stated in Aśv. Sr. S. quoted above: (3) he should not engage in the rite of pindapitryajña or pārvanaśrāddha at all (Gobhila-smrti II. 93). The Nirnaya sindhu says that there are numerous alternatives mentioned by different writers, that they are forbidden in the Kali age and com</p>

<p>that one view is that a man whose father is alive cannot engage in a pārvanaśrāddha and that the real conclusion is that śrāddha may be offered to those to whom the father of the performer ) who is living offers pindas. It is clear that one whose father is living should have nothing to do with pindadāna for deceased ancestors. Manu (in latter half of III. 220) allowed an alternative viz. one should feed one&rsquo;s father at a dinner (and honour him with the details of worship such as gandha, dhūpa, dipa) and offer pindas to the deceased grandfather and great-grandfather. When any one or two out of the three paternal ancestors are alive and śrāddha is permitted to a descendant several alternatives become possible by permu tation and combination, which are passed over here from considerations of space and utility. But the various views held by different writers as described above show clearly what a firm grip the theory of the supreme benefits to be derived from śrāddhas had on the minds not only of common people but of learned men, who, in spite of the fact that the father was alive and was there to offer pindas to his three ancestors, allowed even the son (whose father was living) to offer pindas to the same three ancestors. The Vişņu Dh. S. extends the procedure about &lsquo;jivatpitrka&rsquo; to one&rsquo;s mother&rsquo;s paternal ancestors ( changing the mantra where necessary ). 1142a Similar rules apply where the performer&rsquo;s mother is alive (Agnipurāna 117.60&rsquo;evam mātrādikasyāpi tathā mātāmahādike&rsquo;).</p>
<p>It is provided by Gobhilasmrti (III. 157) that a śruti injunc tion should be made effective by means of anukalpa (of some substituted procedure) if the primary procedure cannot be carried out.1143 If a person cannot secure several brāhmaṇas but can secure only one, he should perform Pārvana-śrāddha in which six pindas are to be offered with a single brāhmaṇa, pro vided he is pankti-pāvana 1144 (sanctifier of a row of diners) and in such a case, naivedya should be offered in place of the dinner</p>

<p>to the daiva brāhmaṇas and the food should be thrown into fire; so says Sankha 14.10. If even a single brāhmana cannot be had for a pārvanaśrāddha, then one should prepare with kušas the effigy of brahmana students (batu) and the performer should himself ask the questions and give the answers required in pārvanasraddha.1145</p>
<p>When one cannot secure a brāhmana nor materials, or when one is on a journey, or on the birth of a son, or when one&rsquo;s wife is in her monthly illness, one may perform āmaśrāddha (Sraddha with uncooked grains). 1146 This is stated by the Skandapurana VII.1.206.52. Katyayana and Saurapurana. 19.32 have similar verses &ldquo;a twice-born person should perform āmašrāddha when he is on a journey or is in distress, or if he has no fire for cooking and those who are weak may always perform it.&rsquo; The Madanapārijāta (p. 483) states that one who has the adhikāra for pārvanaśrāddha can alone offer āmasrāddha. Hārīta says that when there is an obstacle in performing a śrāddha, āmasrāddha is prescribed except in the case of māsika and sāmvatsarika śrāddhas, 1147 Amaśrāddha is always pres cribed for sūdras. It was further provided that the grains offered in srāddha should be utilized by the brāhmaṇas for eating the cooked food for themselves and were to be applied for no other purpose (Hemādri, Śr. p. 1527). Vyāsa provides 1148 that the quantity of grains should be at least two or three or four times as much as the grains required for offering cooked food.

<p>svadhākāra and dismissal of the brahmanas had to be changed 0. g. in ävāhana the verse employed is &lsquo;usantastvā&rsquo; (Vāj. S. 19.70) which ends with the words ‘havişe attave&rsquo; (which means</p>
<p>in order to eat the havis&rsquo;) the words &lsquo;havişe svikartave&rsquo; would have to be substituted.</p>
<p>Amasraddha is to be performed in the first part of the day, ekoddista in the noon, the pārvanaśrāddha in the afternoon and yrddhišrāddha in the first part of the day (divided into five ). 1149a</p>
<p>If even uncooked food grains cannot be offered the per formier should perform hemaśrāddha (śräddha with money ). When the sun passes from one sign of the zodiac into another, in default of food and brāhmaṇas, on a journey, on the birth of a son, in an eclipse, in the case of women and südras hema śrāddha is allowed or when one&rsquo;s wife is in her monthly illness. In āmaśrāddha twice the quantity of grains required in offering cooked food and in hemaśrāddha four times (the price of the grains required for cooked food) has to be offered. If no money can be had the digests prescribe several modes which have already been set out above ( vide p. 425, n. 955).</p>
