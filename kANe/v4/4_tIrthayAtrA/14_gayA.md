CHAPTER XIV 

GAYA 

Gaya occupies a unique place in the hearts of all pious Hindus eren in these days. Hundreds of pages bave been written about the history, the antiquities, the architectural remains of Gavā, the sacred places in and round about Gayā, the sraddha rites performed in Gaya and about Gayawals (the priests of Gaya). It is not possible to deal with this vast mass in this worko Bat it is impossible not to say a few words about the many conflicting views on certain important matters put forward by scholars for about three quarters of a century. Those who are deeply interested in the history and antiquities of Gaya should carefully read the following books and papers; Dr. Rajendralal Mitra's 'Buddha-Gaya' with 51 plates (1878); General Cunningham's 'Mahabodhi' with 31 plates at the end (1992); L. S.S. O'Malley's District Gazetteer of Gayā, vol. XII and J. A S. B for 1903 LEXI, No. 3, pp 1-11 on 'Gayāśrāddha and Gayāyals;' Indian Antiquary, yol pp. 339-340 for a Chinesa Inscription at Buddha Gayā dated in a Chinese date COTTesponding to 1033 A D. and pp. 341-347 for Inscriptions at Gaya, one of which is engraved in a temple of the Sun near a tank 'Daksinamāpasa' near the Visoupada, dated 1813 years after Buddha's Pariniryāṇa; Indian Antiquary, VOL 16 pp 63 ff Inscription of Yatsapāla, son of Viśrāditya, which records the building of a temple for certain images in the 15th regnal year of the Pāla king Nayapāladeya who died in 1045 A.D., edited by Kjelhorn; Dr. Benimadhav Bajua's 'Gayā and Buddha. Gaga' in two volumes (1934) with plates; Journal of Bibar and Orissa R. Society, vol. 24 (for 1938) pp. 89-111 where Dr. J.O. Ghose deals with the antiquity of Gaya.' Some of the remarks of Di Ghose are most unwarranted and cannot be accepted, such as holding 'maganda' in 'Pramagandasya' in Rg. III. 53. 14 as identical with Magacha and the explanation of 'udantyāh' in the Ait. Br. as people of sunrise' Among medieval digests Gafā is dealt with in Kalpataru on Tirthas pp 163–174, Tīrtha cintamani of Vacaspati pp. 268-328, Tristhalisetu of Nārāyana bhatta pp. 316-379, Tirthaprakāsa pp. 384-452, Tirthendu sekhar: pp. 51-59, Tristhalisetu-sāra-sangraha of Bhattoji pp. 36-38,

The most important work on Gayā relied upon in such works as the Tristhali-setu and in modern times is the Gaya mālātmya that occurs at the end of the Vayupurāna (ohapters 105–112 of the Anandāśrama ed.). Scholars differ about the antiquity of these chapters. Rajendralal Mitra assigned the Gaya-māhātmya to the 3rd or 4th century AD. O'Malley was inclined to hold that the legend of Gayāsura was invented in the 14th or 15th century, principally on the ground that the Gayāwals profess the Vaissava faith established by Madhva. cārya 1:68 and acknowledge as their spiritual head the mahant of Hari Narasimhapura; vide J. A. S. B. vol. LXXI (1903) P. 4. To my mind there is hardly anything in this. The Gayawals are notorious for their indolence, dissoluteness and ignorance and they are a dying race. O'Malley himself notes in the paper mentioned above at p. 8) that originally the families of Gayawals were 1484, that in Buchanan Hamilton's time they numbered about 1000, that in 1893 a Gayāwal counted 128 families, that in the census of 1901 there existed only 168 males (as pure Gayawals) and 153 females. Gaya is a place sacred to Yispu and if the Gayāwals had to turn in medieval times for support to some great acārya they would naturally choose to align themselves with the Vaisnava ācārya Madhye rather than with Saṅkara Dr. Barua, after an elaborate exami nation of the several iterns of evidence, holds 'that' the Gaya mahatmya is not earlier than the 13th or 14th century A. D. (vol. I. P. 64 of Gaya and Buddha Gaya'). From considerations of the space at my disposal I cannot examine in detail his argu ments His conclusion is vitiated mainly for two reasons. He relies too muoh on the dubious and unconvincing argument from silence. He examines the account of Gayā that appears in - the Vanaparya and compares it with the fuller account in the Gayāmābatmya and arrives at the rather startling conclusion "The Gayā proper as known to the Epic (the Mabābhārata) is essentially a place sacred to Yama Dharmarāja, Brahma and Sivasūlin, and Vispu and Vaisna. vism has no place in it either as a name or as an idea. Except 

1468 There is conduct abont the dates of Madhvācārya's birth and death. The-Uttaradı-matha records give sake 1040 (1118 A. D.) and saxe 1120 (1198 A. D.) as the dates of his birth and death respectively. Th19 15 said to conflict with the date given in Madhva's FEDETTrafora viz. that he was born 10 Trasto 4300. In a paper published in the Journal of the Annamalai University, vol III for 1934 pp. 245ff, the correct dates are said to be 1238 A.D.-1317 A, D.

Dr. Barua on Gayāmāhātmya

Brahmayūpa, Sivalinga and Vrsabha there is no refe rence to any structural erection nor any iconic suggestion'. In order to show how this conclusion is not at all justified the references to Gaya in the Epic and other Sanskrit works will hare to be set out and compared with each other and with the Gayāmāhātmya. The second reason that vitiates Dr. Barua's conclusion is the wrong interpretation that he puts on yerse 12 of the Inscription edited by Kielhorn in I A, yol 16, 

I shall now turn to the name Gayā and references to it or similar names from the Rgveda downwards. A Gaya, son of Plati, is the reputed author of two hymns of the Rgveda (X. 63 and X 64). In Rg X, 63. 17 and X. 64. 17 we have the words 'astāri jado divyo Gayena' (the divine host was praised by Gaya). So Gaya was a proper name applied to a composer of Rgvedic hymns. In the Rg, the word Gaya has several other senses, which are not material here. In the Atharvaveda (1. 14.4) Gaya appears to be a wonder-yorker or a sorcerer along with Asits and Kaśyapa. Even in the Vedic Samhitās Asuras, Dāsas and Raksasas are credited-with tricks and magic. Vide Rg VII 99.4, VII 104,24-25 and Atharva IV, 23.5. It is not difficult to imagine how a sorcerer Gaya could have been transformed into Gayāsura later on, Proceeding further, the Nirukta 1469 while explaining 'idam Vigdur-vi cakrane tredbā nidadhe padam' (Rg. I 22. 17) gives two very interesting interpretations, one explaining the verse as a natural phenomenon and the other explaining it from geographical or legendary points of view Ho (Visou) puts down his foot in three ways. According to Śakapūni, Vispu plants his foot on the earth, in mid air (sky) and heaven; according to Aurnavābha, on Samarohada, on Viṣnu pada and on Gayaśiras.' Whatever the Vedic verse may mean, it is clear that two interpretations had arisen several centuries before Christ and if the usual dates about Buddha's nirvana are accepted surparābba and Yāska both flourished before Buddha. Vide S. B. E. vol. XII pp. XXII-XXII for Buddha's nirlūna being placed at 483 B, C. according to Ceylonese chronicle, while sonie western scholars would place it between 429-400 B. C 1470 Gayasiras is named in the Vanaparva (87. _____1469 वेधा निधत्ते पदम् । पृथिव्यामन्तरिक्ष दिवीति शाकपूणिः। समारोहणे विष्णुपदे TAFETTET STUET: 1 foi 12 19,

B. E. vol. XII p. 134) in which last it is said that after having dwelt at Uruvela, Buddha accom panied by a thousand bhikkhus went to Gayāsisa (which is the Pali equivalent of Gayasirga). Traditions of Gaya as a king of the territories round about Gsyā are mentioned in Jaina and Buddhist works. The Uttaradhyayapasūtra (S BE, vol. 45 p. 86 and note 3 there) states that he was son of king Samudravijaya of Rajagrha and became the 11th Cakravartin, The Buddbacarita of Aśyaghosa states that Buddha visited the hermitage called a city of the royal sage Gaya, that the saint (future Buddha) fixed his dwelling on the pure bank of the Nairanjanā river (S. B. E vol. 49 part 1 p. 132, Canto XII. 87-88) and p. 193 (chap XVII, 8 of the same work) and that Buddha went to the hermitage of Kāśyapa at Gayā called Uruyilvā, The same vork (S. BE , 49 part 1 192) speaks of Dharmātays where dwelt 700 ascetics whom Buddha helped to enter nirvana Visnupada occurs in the Vispudharmasūtra 85 40 as a holy place very fit for śrāddha. In my opinion at least Aurnayabha held that in & particular region there were three places on which according to the legends current in his day the foot-prints of Vispu's foot could be seen 1471. Two of

Rajendralal la "Buddha-gaya'p 19 says 'Gayāsıras is not the Brabmayoni bill but a low spur of it to the porth-east about a mile in area forming the site of the old town of Gaya. This Gayasıras is the most sacred spot ra Gayā.' Dr, Barba (vol. I 'p. 246) 'Gayā proper is still sandwiched between the Pbalgu and a small set of hills containing some 25 bill-tops with Gayasra or Gayāsıra (Brahma yadi) in the south-west &c', Both are, boxever, agreed that Gas asiras 16 part of the ancient Gaya region.

Viṣnupada and Gayaśıras

these, Visnupada and Gayaśiras ara well-known; hence it would not be unreasonable to hold that 'Samārohana' is a place and has to be located somewhere near the other two. Samārohana means 'mounting up' or 'ascending'. This word probably refers to the ascent of the hill that rises up from the river Phalgu, It is also possible that it is the same ag the Udyanta hill echoing with the varbling (of birds) 1472 I therefore hold that at least 600 years before Christ (and hence' even before Buddha) there was a tradition about Visno's footprints in at least two well-known places viz. Vispupada and Gaya-siras (both in Gayā). Even if some other work does not mention any one of these it does not follow from mere non-inention that that spot was not so named or did not exist. 

Let us now turn to the Vanaparvā. Dr. Barua mainly relies, on Vanaparva 84, 82-103 and 95, 9-29. But some preliminary remarks must be made before the two passages are examined. 

The Nāradiyapurāna (uttara, 46. 16) states that Gayasiras extends from Krauñcapada to Phalgutirtha, 

Vanaparva chapter 82 sets out Pulastya's replies to Bhisma's question about tirthas. First comes Puskara (verses 20-40), then Jambumārga, Tandujikāśrama, Agastyasasah, Mahākāa, Kotitirtha, Bhadravata (Sthānutirtha), Narmadā, Prabhāsa and several other tirthas (not in any particular order but selected at random). In chap 83 Kuruksetra is described at some length, 

Before discussing the most important passage of the Vana. parva (viz. 84. 82–103) we must see what precedes the descrip tion of Gayā. Dr. Barua and many of those that have written on this passage have not carefully considered the implications of verses 1-81 of chapter 84 and also of the following chapters. In Vanaparva 84. 1-81 the author makes Dhaumya name 

(Continued from last page) gupta. Therefore Visau's footpnat existed on a bill dear Delbı in the 4th Ceptory A D. There is no sound reaspo advanced why it could not have existed at Gayā about the same time or even earker, Besides in the Rām. 11 68 19 a Ftgtę south of the river at it is mentioned. 

1472. Dr Barna regards mac 1Vapaparva 84.93 as the name of a peat (vol I p. 246). But this appears to be wrong It is an adjective of an (T ) that immediately precedes, I have not come across any peak called TTGANICA 10 any other work and Dr. Barna does not cite any other text in support of his viele, gen mould mean 'the bill of sunrise,' n'ot aecessarily for the whole of Aryāvarta but in the place where both four and TATOTT Bere situated

about 57 holy places (including such famous ones as Naimisa, Sākambhari, Gangadvāra. Kanakhala, the confluence of Ganga and Yamunā, Kubjāmraka) and then comes to speak of the sacred spots in Gayā 1473 It is therefore clear that the intention of the author is not to speak exhaustively about any tirtha. For this reason some tirthas are described twice in the Vang parva. For example Naimisa is very highly praised 10 chap. 84. 59-64 and again in chap. 87. 6-7. The same happens vith re gard to Gaya in 85.82-103 and 87.8-12. We cannot at all presume

It may be noted that the Padmapurāna, Ādıkhanda, chap 38 (verses 2-19) contains verbatim and in the same order the verses about Gaya in the Vapaparva 84, 82-99 except that a word 18 changed bere and there.

Sacred spots in Gaya and Panaparva 649 

from the manner in which tirthas in Gayā are pamed and des cribed that the writer of Vanaparva (chap. 84. 82–103) meant to be exhaustive as regards the holy spots in Gayā or the legends about Gaya, This conclusion is very much strengthened by the fact that in the Apuśāsanaparva three seored spots in Gayā are mentioned which do not occur in Vanaparva 84. 82-103 viz. 'In Gayā a man becomes purified in Asmappstha (the same as Pretaśilā), on the bill Niravinda and of even a third brāhmana murder in Krauṛcapadi'. 1474 These three, A.śmaprstha, Nira vinda and Krauñoapadī, are in addition to those sacred spots that are mentioned in Vanaparya 84, In Vayu 109, 15 a hill Aravindaka is said to be a peak of the Silāparyata and Nāradīya (uttara 47, 83), Vāyu 108.75 and Nāradiya (uttara 46.16) men tion the hill Krauñcapada (Munda-prstha was so oalled) There fore it is clear that three important sites in the Gayāmahatmya are mentioned by the Anuśāsanaparya. 

It was unfortunate that Dr. Barua confined his attention on the question of the antiquity of Gayā to merely three works yiz, the Vanaparva chapters 84 and 95, the Agnipurāna chap. 114-116 and the Vāyupurāna chapters 105-112. He did not care to investigate all the other Purānas nor did it strike him that the explanation of three padas of Vispu furnished by Aurnayābha probably referred to spots around Gayā alone, Other Puranas such as Padma (Adikhanda 38.2-21), Garuda I chapters 82-86, and the Nāradiya (uttara chap. 44-47) contain much that concerns Gayā and all of them have many verses in common. The critical edition of the Mahābhārata (published by the B O.R.I., Poona) reads 'sāvitram padam' (chap. 82.81) for 'savitryāstu padam of the Bombay edition. The reading of the critical edition is supported by numerous and ancient Mss, Further, the printed Padmapurāna (in Ādikhanda 38. 13) Teads 'Savitram padam' and thus lends support to the reading adopted in the critical edition. The words 'sūvitram padam' may be taken to mean the foot-print of Visou (Savitr). Dr. Barua goes very much further than the facts warrant when he says that there is no reference in the Vanaparva to any struc tural erection or iconic suggestion. It is clear that there must have been an image of Dharma, since the Vanaparva speaks of 

1474 अम्मपृष्ठे गयाया च निरविन्दे च पर्वते । तृतीयां क्रौञ्चपद्यां च ब्रह्महत्या AYES JEṣit 25. 42. fimus explains 'Braye varat DA TEGI ध्यपोश निरविन्दे मुखगन्धहीने द्वितीयां ब्रह्महत्या निरस्य क्रौञ्चपदीति सर्वेषां विष्णुपदा दीनामुपलक्षणं तेषु तृतीयां बद्महत्या सकृढ़या गत एव विशुध्यते पूतो भवति,

History of Dharmaśūsira -the pilgrim to Gayā haring to touch Dharma (Danimam tatrā. bhi-samsprśya). Besides, there is a reference to the footprints of a cor with a calf and to 'Saritra pada'. All these Trould surely be things that have an 'iconic suggestion. NO POTCT, Dr. Barua forgets for the moment that, according to the Chinese trareller F& Hien who visited India between 399.13 'Å. D., the Gaya of the Hindu faith was all emptiness and desolation (ride Legge's translation p. 37) that Gayā might hare suffered from earthquakes befora 400A. 

It is possihie D. (as it is a region that is liable to severe carthquakes eren in modern times) and therefore no structural eraction of t'ia ancient city of Garā (to which ancient Pali works and tra Lalitaristara p 311 refer) might liare been left in Ha llion's day. Gayā appears to have passed through several vicissitudes. Some centuries before the Christian cra it was in cristence ari vas a flourishing torn, Bs 400 AD. it had been reduced to desolation. But in the 7th century the Chinese traveller Hiouen Thsang notes that the Hindu Garā ras a torn with 1000 brāhmana families (ride Beal's B R. 11.W. rol. II p. 1131 Later on ghen Buddhismı taned and ranished, Gayā came is comprehend eren Buddhist remnants, since the Mārupuris. speaks of Garā as extending from Pretasila to Mabibodhi tres (a distance of about 13 miles, according to Mitra p 39). 

Dr, Barua has also misunderstood rerse 12 of the inscrip tion at Gayā edited by Dr. Kielhorn in LA. 16 p. 63 ff. The verse1473 set out below may be translated as follons That vise (prince Yaksapala) caused to be constructed a temple for the images of Maunāditya and the other gods (mentioned in it), he dug up the famous Ullaramūnası loka and esta blished a sattra (charity house for food) near to Al ara (vata).

engraved about 1040 A.D. Dr. Barue thought that Uttaramānasa was dug up at that time and therefore Uttaramānasa tank is taken to be not older tban 1040 A D. and that it and many of the sacred spots must have been later and the Gayā. māhātmya which speaks of Uttarmānasa must be much later than the 11th century A. D. But Dr Barua is entirely mistaken in this. If a tank was dug up for the first time at the time of the inscription, it is impossible that it should have been called "kuyata' (famous). The tank can become famous some centuries after it was dug. Uttarmānasa tank is mentioned as a sacred spot in Vayupurāna 77. 108 (which verse is quoted about 1110 A.D. in the Kalpataru on tirtha at p. 168), Vāyu 82.21, Agni 115. 10. Therefore Uttaramānasa tank was well known at least in the 8th or 9th century AD. What the inscription means is either that the famous tank bad silted up and so it was dug up or that it was made longer, broader and deeper in about 1040. That is all. 

In my opinion the Gayāmābātmya (Vāyu, chap. 105-112), though possibly later than the main text of the Vayupurāna, cannot be placed so late as the 13th or 14th century A. D. It is really & patch-work from many sources of earlier times such as the Vanaparva, Anusāsanaparva, Padma I 38, the Naradiya (uttara) chap. 44-47 Several verses and half verses of it are repetitions (such as the half verse 'Gayāyām aksayam śrāddham japalomatapāmsi ca' Vāyu 108 35 and Vāyu 82,43 quoted as from Vāyu in Kalpataru on tirtha p. 167, and Vayu 110. 29-30 are the same as Vāyu 105,37-38. So also Vāyu 82, 31-33 are the same as Vāyu 110, 51-53. Dr. Barua does not notice that in chap. 82 of the Vayu (20-24) several sub-tirthas of Gayā are sa pressly mentioned viz. Brahmakunda, Prabhāsa, Pretaparvata, Uttaramāgasa, Udici, Kanakhala, Daksinamādaga, Dharn āranya, Gadādhara, Matanga; 80 also chap 77.97-108 mention Grdbrakūta, hermitage of Bharata, Matangapada, Munda prstha and Uttaramānasa. Many of the verses occurring in the Gayāmāhātinya are found quoted in the Smrtioandrikā 1476

one (of whom) goes to Gayā, or performs the Aśyamedha sacri fice or lets loose a nila bull' (the pitrs may be gratified ). Then Vanaparya chap. 87 goes on to refer to the holy river (maha nadi) Phalgu, the hill Gayaśiras, the Aksayya Vata, where food offered to pitrs becomes inexhaustible. In Vanaparva 95 men tion is made of Brabnasaras (where Agastya went to Dharma rāja i. e. Yama, verse 12), of Aksayavata (v. 14) which is an imperishable place of worship and where the fruit (of offerings made) is inexhaustible; it further states that king Gaya, son of Amūrtarayas, 1471a performed a sacrifice in which food and fees in plenty were distributed (verses 18-19). Vas. (XI. 42) states: when a man goes to Gayā and offers food his ancestors become delighted like agriculturists that rejoice when there is good rain and pitrs become (really) putrın (having a son) on account of such a son The Visnudharmasūtra, chapter 85, 1478 mentions by name about 55 holy places that are most proper for śrāddha among which those connected with Gayā are Gayāsirsa, Aksaya vata, Phalgu, Uttaramānasa, Matangavāpi, Visnupada, and winds up by quoting three verses as gātās sung by pitrs, - Yāj. I 261 states that whatever a man gives while in Gayā leads to inexhaustible rewards. Atri-smrti (55-58 ) refers to a son's going to Gayā for the benefit of the pītrs, to a bath in Phalgu and tarpana of pitrs in the river, to seeing Gadādhara (Visnu) at Gayā and to Gayāśīrsā. Saṅkha (14 27-28) refers 1479 to several tirthas (one being Gaya) the offerings made at which

The Likhita-Smrti speaks 1480 of the importance of Gayā as follows: In whosesoever name a pinda is offered at Gayāśiras, whether for oneslf or for another, that person, if in hell, goes to heaven and if in heaven that man secures release (from samsāra). The Kūrmapurāna remarks that ono should desire to have many sons so that if one out of them goes to Gayā on some other business and offers sraddha, ho thereby saves his pitrs and himself reaches the highest goal. The Matsyapurana (22. 4-6) quoted by the Kalpataru (on tirtha p. 163) speaks of Gayā as pitrtirtha and as the best among tirthas where Bralmā himself dwells and also has the verse 'estavyā bahavah putrah'. 

In the Gayāmāhātmya (Vāyupurāda, chapters 105-112) thiero aro about 560 verses. An attempt will be made here to give a brief summary of it and some of the important verses will be quoted. Chapter 105 is general and briefly indicates some of the main topics dealt with in the following chapters. It states that in Syotavārāhakalpa Gaya performed a saorifice and Gayū was named after him 1481, that putrs hanker after gons because the son that goes to Gayā saves the pitrs from hell 1482, At Gayā a man should offer pindas to his father and others and even to himself but without sesame; all the five mortal sins lika brāhmapa-murder are removed by the perfor mance of śrāddba at Gayā. A. pinda offered after uttering the name and gotra of the recipient by the son or any other person in Gayā leads that person to the imperishable bralıma 1483, Moksa ia fourfold (i. e, results in four ways) viz. by knowledge of brahma, śrāddha at Gayā, death in (a fight for preventing) the seizure of cows and residence in Kuruksetra and śrāddha at

$rūddha at Gaya 

Gaya renders the others unnecessary 1484Srāddha may be performed at Gayā at all times, even in an intercalary month, on the anniversary of one's birthday, or even when Jupiter and Venus are invisible or when Jupiter is in Leo. One should honour the brāhmanas (of Gayā) that were established there by Brahmā; when they are gratified all deities together with the pitrs are gratified. Tonsure 1485 and fast are to be observed at all tirthas except in Kuruksetra, Viśālā, Virajā and Gayā. An ascetic 1485 (sannyasin) should not offer pindas (at Gaya) but should merely exhibit (hold up) bis staff and should put it down on Visnupada The (whole) Gayāksetra is five lerośas in extent and Gayāśiras is ono krośa and all the tirthas of the three worlds are centered in these two 1487, AC Gayā one may offer (to pitrs) pindas by means of payasa (rice cooked in milk), boiled rice, barley flour, fruits and roots, the cake of sesame (after oil is extraoted), sveetmeats or jag gery with ghee or with curds alone or with invigorating honey. In a śrāddha at Gayā, the procedure consists in pre paring 1488 a seat for the pindas, the offering of pindas, the sprinkling of water again (on the kusa grass), giving fees and declaration of dinner (to brāhmadas); but there is no invoca. tion of pitrs, no curtains for privacy and no blemish due to śrāddha being seen (by undesirable persons or animals) Those who desire to reap the full fruit of śrāddha performed at a tirtha (like Gayā) must give up passionate longings, anger and

The famous river Vaitarani. has come down to Gayā; one taking a bath in it and donating a cow saves 21 generations in his family, One should go to the Aksayapata and gratify the (Gaya) brāhmanas. There is no spot in Gayā which is not a sacred place, 1489 

Chap. 106 narrates the story of Gayasura. Gayāsura, a very powerful asura 125 yojanas in height and 60 yojanas in girth, performed severs austerities for thousands of years on the nountain called Kolābala. The gods, anxious and torment ed by his austerities, went to Brahmā for protection. Bralmā took them to Siva who proposed to go to Visnu. Brahmā, Sira and the gods praised Visnu, who appeared to them and said that they should, riding their respective conveyances, go to Gaya sura. Vispu asked him why he practised søvere austerities and said that the boon he would ask would be granted. He asked the boon that he should be purer than al the gods, sages, mantras, ascetics &c The gods said "let it be so' and left for heaven, All people who saw or touched Gayāsura's holy body went to heaven. The capital of Yama became deserted and so he went to Brahmā who took him to V790u who asked Brahma to request Gayāṣura to give his pure body for the purpose of a 880 rifice. Gayāsura agreed and fell down on the earth towards the southwest with his head on the north on Kolāhala mountain and feet to the south. Brahma collected materials and mind-born Tiinks (about 40 are named) and performed a sacrifice on the body of Gayāsura, That body, however, was not stable but moved and hence Brahmā asked Yama to place on Gayasura's bead a śilā (stone slab) that was in Yama's house, Yama did so; pot Gayāsura's body together with the śılā still moved. Brahma asked Siya and other gods to stand immoveable on the sila. They did so and yet the body moved. Hence Brabma went to Vispu and requested him to make the body and slā stablo, Visnu gave his own muriand though it was placed on the sila it still moved. Then Visni sat on the sila in three forms piz Japārdana, Pundarika and Adi-Gadādhara, Brahmā in five forms (Prapitāmaba, Pitāmaha, Phalgyisa, Kedāra and Kanakeśvara), Vinayaka in the form of an elephant, the Sun in three forme, the Goddesses Laksimi (as Sita), Gauri (as Mangala), Gayatri

and Sarasvati. As Gayasura was made stable by the first Gadā 

(mace) wielded by Hari, therefore Hari was called Ādigada dhara.1490 Gayāsura complained 'why am I deceived? I have giver my pure body to Brabmā for the latter's sacrifice. Would I not have become stable at the mere word of Visou (why tor ment me with the mace ?).' Then the gods asked him to choose a boon. He chose 'As long as the earth, mountains, the Sun, Moon and stars last, may Brahmā, Visnu and Siva and the other gods remain on the silal Let this sacred spot be known by my name, Let all tirthas be centered in the midst of Gayā which is five krośas in extent and in Gayāśiras which is one brosa and do good to people. May all the gods remain here in manifest forms (images &c ) and unmanifest forms (such as footprints &c)! Those to whom śrāddha with pindas is offered may go to the world of Brahma and all grave sins like brāhmana-murder be destroyed at once. The gods said 'Let it be so.' Then Brahma gave to the brāhmadas Gayā (with its extent of five krośas ), 55 villages, well-furnished houses, desire-yielding cow and trees, & river flowing with milk, golden tells, heaps of food, but enjoined on them not to beg from any one else. But the brāhmapas, greedy as they were, performed a sacrifice for Dharma in Dharmāranya and begged him for fees, Then Brahmā came, cursed them and took away everything from them. When the brāhmanas bewailed that they had been deprived of everything and their livelihood should be provided for, Brahmā said that they would live on the charity of pilgrims to Gayā and those who would honour them would be honouring Brahmā. 

Chap. 107 deals with the story of the silā 1491 that was placed on the head of Gayāsura for making it stable. Dharma had a daughter called Dharmavrata Dharma could not find a bridegroom worthy of her virtues and accomplishments and asked her to perform tapas for the purpose. She performed severe austerities (subsisting only on air) for ten thousand years. Marici, one of the mind-born sons of Brahma, once saw her and asked her to become his vife. Dharmavrata asked him to request her father Dharma, Marici approached Dharma who

History of Dharmasastra gave her in marriage to Marlci, who took her to his hermitage and had one hundred sons from her. Once Marici being tired lay down for sleep and asked Dharmavrata to shampoo his feet, While she shampooed his feet Brahmā (her father-in-law) oame there. She left off shampooing her husband's foot and got up to receive with honour her husband's father. In the meanwhile Marici awoke and not seeing his wife oursed her to be a sila (atone slab) as she disobeyed his order by giving up the sham pooing of his feet. She being innocent of any fault got angry and was about to curse Marici but said 'Mahadeva will curse you'. She, standing in the midst of Gārhapatya fire, performed tapas and Marici also did the same. The gods led by Indra got anxious as usual and went to Visou who asked her to choose a boon. She prayed that the ourse pronounced by her husband be annulled. The gods said that Marici being a great sage the curse could not be annulled and asked her to choose some other boon, She said that she should be a śija more holy than all rivers, sages and gods and that all tirthas should stand in the slab of stone, that those who would bathe in the tirthas on the silā and offer pindas and grāddha should be able to go ta brahmaloka, that all holy rivers like the Ganges should alvays remain in her. The gods conceded what she prayed for and said that when she would become stable on the head of Gayasura, they would all stand on the gila. 

Chap. 108 presents numerous divergences in the Mas In the Anandāśrama edition its contents briefly are; The sila was placed on the head of Gayāsura and therefore there was union of two very, holy objects, on which Brahmā performed Aśramedha and when the gods came to receive their share of the sacrificial offerings the silā said to Visnu and others 'pro mise that you would remain on the silk and would bring about the release of pitrs'. The gods agreed and they stayed on the sila in the form of images and foot-prints. As the silk was placed on the back of the head of the Asura the hill was called Mundaprstha (lit, the back of the head) which gave Brahma. loka to pitrs. Then the chapter speaks of a hill called Pra bhāsa, of Rāmatirtha near the place where the great river -(Phalgu) and Prabhāsa hill meet, the hermitage of Bharata, of Matangapada, of the bal to be offered to Yamarāja and Dharma raja and to the dogs of Yama, viz. Śgāma and Sabala, of the Udyantaka bill near the left of sila, of Agastya-kunda, and nūmṛrous other holy places such as Grdhrakūta hill, the her

mitage of Oyavana, the river Punahpunā, Krauñca-pada, Janārdana on Bhasmakūta. 

The story of Gayāsura has puzzled Mitra and subsequent writers. Mitra holds that nothing appears more absurd or stupid than the story of Gayāsura who, he emphasizes, is not a demon or & vicious monster, but a devout Vaisnava ('Bodh Gaya' pp. 15-16). The story of Gayāsura is not unique. The Puranas abound in stories that appear to modern minds absurd and puerile. Besides, there were several asuras like Prahlada, Bāna (devotee of Siva) and Bali (who was an exemplary and pious king and a worshipper of Visnu) that were not monsters but good and devout persons, and yet fought with gods. For ex ampie, Kūrmapurāna (I. 16. 59-60 and 91-92) narrates that Prahlada fought with Nisimha; the Padma (Bhumikhanda 1.8) calls him a Mabābhāgavata but states that he first fought with Vishu and entered Vaisgavitanu; while Vāmanapurāna (ohap. 7-8) speaks of his fight with Naranārāyana In Pali works (e. g. Anguttara-nikāya, part IV pp. 197–204) he is called Pahārāda and asur inda (asurendra). Vide Anguttara-nikaya (text) vol. IV p. 197. For Bali who was grandson of Prahlada, a good king and a devotee of Visnu, vide Brahmapurāna, chap. 73, Kūrma I, 17, Vāmana (chapters 77 and 92). For Bāna, son of Bali and the fight of Bāna helped by Siya vith Krspa, vide Brahma chap. 205-206 and Vispupurāpa V. 33. 37-38. 

According to Dr, Rajendralal Mitra (in 'Bodh-Gaya' pp. 14. 18) the story of Gayasura is an allegory of the vanquishing of Buddhism by Brahmanism. O' Malley thought (J. A S. B. vol, LXXII part 3 p. î for 1904) that the Gayāgura legend represents an amalgamation or compromise of Brahmanism with the popular demonolatry which preceded Brahmanism, Dr, Barua critisizes both theories and appears to hold (rol, I. pp. 40-41) that the idea underlying the legend is to impress on people's minds the high sanctity of the Gayā tange of hills along the western bank of the river Phalgu, that Gayā figures nowhore in Buddhism, that Gaya 1492 or Namuci or Vrtra is represented as a demon of darkness and as an enemy of Indra and that the Vedic word Trivikraina and the interpretation of Aurparābha are the nucleus of the legend of Gayasura. From considerations of space it is not possible to discuss these 

• 1492 It is not cicar wbence' Dr Barua derived his information that in the Veda Gaya is represented as a demon like Vrtra. In tbe Rg. at least Gaza is not a demon like Vrtra,

theories here. To my mind it appears that Gaya bad become a famous pitrtirtha centuries before Christ and that the logond of Gayāsura is a post facto attempt to account for the sanctity" of the place and the numerous shrines and holy places that lod sprung up round Gaya, 

Chap. 109 deals with the questions how Adi-Gadadhara abided in manifest and unmanifest forms, how bis gadā (muce) was produced and how the tirtha called Gadalola becamo a destroyer of all sins: There was a poworfu) Agira called Gada, who, when Bralımā. requested, gave up lis bones to Brahmā. Viśvakarma, at the desire of Brahma, fasbioned a wonderful mace out of the bones. In the times of Srayanbhura Manu an Asur3 Damed Heti, son of Bralmā, porformed severe austerities for thousands of divine years. He secured from Brahina and other gods the boon that he could not be killed by gods, dartyas, men or with such weapons as the discus of Kısna and others. Heti conquered the gods and became Indra. The gods went to Hari and roquested him to kill Heti. He asked for a powerful veapon and the gods gave him the mace manufactured from the bones of Gada and Visnu killed Heti with the Gadā. This story about demon Hoti is mentioned in Agni 114 26-27 and Nāradiya (uttara) 47.9.-21. Hari is called Adi-Gadadhara because 1992 he was the first to wield that mace and stood on the silā on the head of Gavagura. supported by the Gadā, in order to make (the hoad of Gayayura) stable. Ha shows himself in the forın of hilla viz. tho Mundaprstba hill, the Prablāsa and other bills. Thoso and Aksayavata, Phaigu and other rivers are the non-nonifest forms of Adigadadbara, The Visnupada, Rudrapadı, Brahma. pada and other padas are the non-manifest and momfost forma of Gadādhara, 1493 The image of Gadadhara is purely a inani.

fest form. Asura Heti was killed by Vispu and went to Visbu loka. When the body of Gayāsura was made stable Brahma sang a hymn of praise to Visou who asked Brahmā to choose a boon Brahmā said 've (gods) shall not abide in the silā with out you, but shall remain therein together with you if you have a manifest forin." 1194 Visnu said 'be it so' and Visnu stood on Gayāsiras in the Adigadadhara form and as Janārdana and Pupdarīkāksa. Siva also praised Visou (Vāyu 109. 43-50). The Vāyu speaks at several places of 'vyaktāvyakta' symbols of the deity (chap. 109, 20 and 43-45) What is meant is Visnu is non-manifest in Phalgu, vyaktāvyakta in Vispupada and manifest in images and statues (vide Tristhalīsetu p. 365, prati masyarūpi vyaktah).

noon the pilgrim should go to the Pretaśılā, take a bath in the Bralmakunda, offer tarpada to the gods and perform sraddha of his sapindas on the Pretasila with the mantras set out in Vayu (110,10-12) and offer pipdas to bis ancestors, In Astakās, in Vrddbiśraddha, at Gayā and on the anniversary of death, one mas offer a śrāddba separately to one's mother but on all other occasions with her husband. 1495 To the sapindas other than one's patorna) ancestors he should offer sraddha to the south (of the place whero he offers to his father &c.) viz, should spread kugas and once offer Fater mixed with sesame and should offer them & pinda made of barley flour and repeat the mantras (Vāyu 110. 21-22). The pindas to be offered at Gayaśiras may be in size as 14% big as one's closed hand, or an undried amalaka (myrobalan) fruit or of the size of sami leaves. By means of these he saves seven gotras viz, that of his father, of his mother, of his wife, sister, daughter, paternal aunt and maternal auzit. Water mixed with sesame and pindas are offered to all persons on the maternal grandfather's side, to all bandhus, to all infants, to persons cremated or not cremated, to persons that were killed by lightning or robbers or that commit ted suicide in various says and to those who may be undergo ing torments of Hells of various kinds and those who have become beasts or birds or insects or trees owing to evil deeds (Vāyu 110, verses 30-55).

In chap. 110 it has been stated as shown above that on entering Gayā, a pilgrim takes a bath in the Phaigu water, performs tarpana and śrāddha, then on the same day he goes to the Pretaśilā (which is a part of the Sujā ag stated in Vāyu 108 15) and performs a śrāddha there and offers pindas with boiled rice and ghee (Vāyu 110.15).

this the persons for whom this is done become free from the position of pretu. It is stated (in Vayı 108, 17--22) that one ghould bathe in the Rāmatirtha which is near the place where Phalgu meets the Prabhāsa hill. By bath in Rāpatirtha and offering of śrāddha and pinda there the persons for whom this is done become pitrs ( being already free from pretatta by the śrāddha on pretaśila). On a hill on the south of Pretaśilā one should offer & bali (food offered with kuśa, sesame and water) to Yamarāja and Dharmarāja and to the two dogs Syāma and Sabala. On the next day after entering Gayā (i. e. the 2nd day), the pilgrim should proceed to the Pretaparvata 1497 (Vāyu 110.8) and take a bath in the Brahmakunda and perform tar pana, sraddha and giving of pindas mixed with sesame, ghee, curds and honey to his ancestors (father, grandfather &c.) with the mantras "pitā pitāmabascaiva' (Vāyu 110. 23-24). Then the pilgrim should offer on kuśas, water, sesame and pindas to persons related in various ways with the mantras * asmat-kule murtā ye ca &o., (Vayu 110. 34-55). He should then invoke the gods to be witnesses to the fact of his having come to Gayā and become free from the debt to the ancestors (Vayu 110. 59-60). It is stated in Vāyu 110,61 that at all eacred spots in Gayā the offering of pindas should be done in the same way as at Pretaparvata 1498. 

On the third day of entering Gaya one has to perform Pañcatīrthi rites 1499 (Vāyu 111, 1 ff.). The pilgrim first bathes in Uttaraniānasa, offers tarpana to gods, gives water and sraddha and pindas to his ancestors with the mantras (Vāyu 110. 21-24). The fruit of this rite is the inexhaustible grati fication of the pitts. Then the pilgrim goes to the three tirthas which constitute Daksinamānasa, viz. Udicītīrtha (on the north), Kanakhala (in the middle) and Daksipamānasa

[Vol. I on the south). At each of these three there is a śrāddha. Then the pilgrim goes to the Phalgutirtha, which is the best of all (Gayā) tirthas. The pilgrim performs tarpana and srāddha with pindas on Phalgu, This śrāddba at Phalgu results in nukta for the performer and also for those for whose benefit it is performed (muktir-bhavati kartfdām pitinām śraddhatah sadā, Vāyu 110. 13). It is stated that Phalgu is Adi-Gadadhara himself in a fluid form.1500 By bath in Phalgu and seeing Gadadhara a map saves himself, ten ancestors and ten descend ants. Then he worships Gadadhara by a bath with pañcamrla after bowing 1500x to Vasudeva, Saṅkarsada, Pradyumna, Aniruddha, Vispu, Srīdhara. On the 2nd day of the Panca tirthi rites (i. e. 4th day from entering Gayā) the pilgrim should repair to Dharmārapya which is so-called because Dharma per formed a sacrifice there. Then the pilgrim should bathe in the Matapgavāpi (which is situated in Dharmāranya), then he should perform darpana, śrāddha and pindadana at the well called Brahmatirtha and also in the space between Brahma tirtha and Brabmayūpa; then bow to Brahma and Dharm eśvara 1501 He should bow to the Mahābodhi tree (1, e, the sacred pippala) and perform śrāddha also underneath it. Agni 115. 34-37 and Nāradiya (uttara) 45, 104 refer to these tirthas, On the third day of the Paicatirthi rites (i. e, on 5th day from entering Gayā) the pilgrima should bathe in Brahmasaras and perform sraddha with pindas between the Brabmakūpa and the Yūpe (sacrificial post) raised by Brahmā vben he performed a sacrifice, By this śrāddha the pilgrim saves his pitrs. 1502 He should go round the Brahma-yūpa and bor

Here follows the verse ('eko munih' &c.) quoted above (1 1493). Then a balt should be offered to Yama and Dharmaraja, then to the two dogs of Yama, then he should offer a bali to cross and then bathe (in Brahmasaras). This is briefly a summary of Vayu 111 30 40. Some of these details are mentioned by Agni 115.34-40 and Nāradiya (uttara) 46. Then on the 4th day of the Panca. tirthi rites (i, e. 6th day from entrance into Gaya) the pilgrim should take an ordinary bath in the Phalgu and should then perform śrāddhas at the several padas on Gayāśiras which is near Phalgutirtha, Gayāśiras extends from Krauñcapāda up to Phalgutirtha. Śrāddha offered here (on Gayāsiras) becomes inexhaustible,1503 Here Adi-Gadadhara abides in the form of Visnupada, By performing a sraddha with pindas on Visnu pada (which is a footprint on a slab deemed to be of Visṇu ) the pilgrim saves one thousand families and takes them and himself to the blissful, inexhaustible and never-ending world of Visou. Then Vāyu 111. 47-56 deal with the towards of śrāddhas performed at Rudrapada, Brahmapada and 14 other padas expressly named by it, 1504 "For whomsoever by name a pilgrim offers a piṇda on Gayāśiras, that man, if in hell, goes to heaven and if in heaven he secures moksa.' 

On the 5th day of the Pañcatirthi rites (i. e, the 7th day from entering Gayā), the pilgrim should bathe in the sacred place called Gadālola, 1505 By performing śrāddha with pindas at Gadāloja he takes his pitrs and himself to the world of Brahmā. Then at the Aksayavata he should perform a grāddha

The Tristhalisetu (P 368) remarks that the above are the fixed rites for seven days in Gaya, that other tirthas may be visited according to one's convenience if one stays in Gaya for half a month or a month; that the grāddha at the Pretabilā is to be the first and that at the Aksayayata is to be performed at the ond, 1507 and that although there is variation between the order in which tirthas are to be visited on the several days according to the Vāyupurāna, the Agnipurava and other purāvās, yet as the Vāpupurāna is most detailed as regards Gayā rites, the order therein should be followed and that one not knowing the order may visit the tirthas in any order 1503 exoept Pretaśilā and Aksagarata. Gayāyātrā, chapter 112 of the Vāyupurāna, refers to king Gaya who performed & yajsia and who got two boons, ons about the restoration of the Gayā brāhmazas to favour and the other that Gayāpuri be named after him and who thon went to Visnuloka. Then it narrates the story of king Vıśāla (versos 7-15) who being sonless performed piodadāda on Gayāśīrsa and thereby saved his three ancestors, got a son and also himself went to heaven. Then another story is told (verses 16-20) of deceased person, who was in the condition of a prela, offoring one-sixth of his property, to a trader and asking him to perform Gayāśrāddha with the rest of his wealth and who on account of śrāddha at Gaya became free from the condition of preta,1509 Then verses 20-60 mention several other tirthas of Gayā such as Gayatritirtha, Prāci-sarasvatitirtha, Visālā, Lelibāna, tho

hermitage of Bharata, Mundaprstha, Akasagangā, Vaitarani and other rivers and sacred places. It winds up by saying that six Gayās confer muktı (by worship and pindadana at them). viz. Gayāgaja, Gayāditya, Gayatri (tirtha), Gadādhara, Gayā and Gayāśiras.150% 

The Agnipurapa (chap 116. 1-34) has a long list of tirthas at Gayā that is quoted by the Tristhallsetu pp. 376-378, which are passed over here. 

Though the number of tirthas at Gayā is very large, the majority of pilgrims do not visit them all. Visits to three places are absolutely necessary for every pilgrim to Gayā, viz. Phalgu river, Vispupada and Aksayavata, at all of which worship has to be done with milk, water, flowers, sandalwood paste, tambula, lighted lamp and pindas to ancestors have to be offered. The Visnupada temple is built over the footprint of Visou on the rock to the west of the river Phalgu The old town of Gayā was built round Visnupada and it is the largest and most important temple in Gayā. The footprint (about 16 inches in length) deemed to be God Visnu's is inside an octa gonal basin plated with silver. Pilgrims of all castes (except untouchables) surround the basin and cast their offerings in side the basin, though for a substantial payment the priests clear out all people, shut the door for a minute or two and allow a very orthodox or a rich person to make his offerings without being disturbed by anyone else There are 45 vedis (or sacred places) at which the leisured pilgrim may offer pindas in the Gayāksetra which extends from about five miles to the north-west of Old Gayā town to about 7 miles south of it. Though the ancient Buddhist works and Fa Hien and Hiouen Thsang make a distinction between Gaya and Uruvilyā or Uruvela where Buddha attained Enlightenment after six years of severe tapas, the Bodhi tree (Mahābodḥitaru) was recognized by the Gayāmābātmya as one of the sacred places which Hindu pilgring should visit and is so regarded eyen pow. When the Hindus appropriated Buddhist sacred places to themselves it is difficult to say. The Bodbi tree is the oldest historical tree in the world A branch of it is said to have been transplanted to Ceylon in the times of the great Emperor Asoka (about 250-B.C)

History of Dharmadastra and at Kandy in Ceylon a pippala tree is even now shown as that travsplanted tube or the suocessor of that branch. The Gayāśīrsa 1520 is a set of rocky hills such as Gayāśīrsa, Manda prgthā, Prabhāsa, Grdhrakūta, Nagakūta, ranging over one krosa (about two miles). 

It has been already stated abové (p 666) that the rites at the Aksayayata are the last in the pilgrimage to Gayā. The Gaya wal priest binds the thumbs or hands of the pilgrim with a garland of flowers and receives his fees He gives sweatmeats to the pilgrim as prasāda, applies talaka to the pilgrim's forehead, touchss the pilgrim on his back, pronounces the word 'suphala' (the pilgrimage has been fruitfu) or successful), declares that the pilgrim's ancestors have gone to heaven and blesses the pilgrim, It must be noted that there is a special class of priests called Dhaujo who alone (and not the ordinary Gajāwals) have the right of officiating at five vedis vis, at Pretasila, Rāmaśili, Rāmakunda, Brahmakunda and Kakabali, that are situated on or about the two hills Rāmaśilā and Pretaśılā (vide Bengal District Gazetteers, vol 12 for Gayā p. 66) They are regarded as inferior in status to the tegular Gayāwals. 

One important question on which there is great divergence of views among the medieval digests is about the ancestors to whom grāddha is to be offered at Gayā. In the Vayu and other Purāpas it is frequently said that he who performs srāddha at Gayā becomes free from the debt due to the pitrs 1551 or that what is offered to the pitrs at Gaya, Dharmaprstha, Brahma. Batas, or on the Gayasirsa and under the imperishable Vata tree becomes inexhaustible. In most of these passages the plural of the word 'pitr' is used. Therefore it follows that śrāddba is to be offered in Gaya to three paternal ancestors. And on account of & verse attributed to Gautania, 1512 the three male materna) an Gestors also are to be offered srāddha. The difference arises with 

1510. Gayāsıras and Gaya were according to Buddhist works well known places in Buddba's days. Vide the Mabavagga 1. 21. 1 (S. B. C. vol 13 p. 134 ) cited above (on p. 646) and Anguftara Nikaya (text) vol IV. p 302' HAY FT Tarat For T his

IV] Ancestors for whom Gaya-śrāddha is offered 669, reference to the wives of these six male paternal and maternal ancestors. The Agnipurāna proposes an option (115 10) that the decatās in Gayāsrāddha are nine or twelve. When they are to be nine, the srāddha is for three paternal ancestors, three male ancestors of the mother and the wives of the latter three male ancestors, while there is a separate śrāddha for the mother, paternal grand-mother and paternal great-grandmother. If there are to be twelve devatās in Gayāśrāddha, then all the vives of the paternal ancestors and of maternal ancestors would be included in one śraddha. Aparārka allowed an option (as in Agai) in Gayā-śrāddha. 1513 According to the Smrtyarthasāra 1911 and Hemādri the Anvastakā śrāddha and Gayāstāddha for the paternal ancestors and that for the vives of these (i. e, mother, paternal grandmother &c.) must always be separate, but the śrāddha for the mother's paternal ancestors and their wives should be one (and therefore the devatās will be nine). Yama (verse 80) appears to hold that the mother, paternal grandmother and paternal great-grandmother are always to be associated with their respective husbands in śrāddha, Some held that the devatās of Gayāśrāddha were only six viz the three male paternal ancestors and three male maternal ancestors.1515 The Tri. s ultimately remarks that the usage of the country should be the deciding principle The Prajapati-smrti (183–184) has some rather contradictory views as to when there would be 12 or 9 or 6 devatās in a srāddha, When there are twelve devatās, the sanhalpa at the Pretaśilā. śrāddha which is the model of all the śrāddhas at the other sacred spots in Gaya (with suitable modifications) will be as noted below. 1516 

It should be noted that there are certain special charac teristics of Gayāśrāddha. There is no tonsure (Vāyu 83. 18

History of Dharmasastra and note 1485 above). One must bonour the Gayāpals alone, and not other brāhmanas, however learned they may be; one should not consider the family or character or learning of Gaya brāhmadas (vide p. 579 above and note 1313). But it has to be remembered that Nārāyapabhatta 1517 did not accept this for all śrāddhas t Gaya, but only as to the śrāddha under the Aksaya. vata, since the Vayu (111, 79-80) again refers under Aksaya vata to the worship of Gaya brāhmabas and sinca following the Daxim of 'caturdhākarana' laid down in Jai. III. 1 26–27 the later specific provision narrows down the wide vords used in the sarlier passage. At Gayā one could offer pioda to oneself but without sesame.1518 The Tri S. ( 

p350) observes (relying on Vāyu) that when a man offers a pinda to bimself, it should be in the hands of the image of Janārdana on Bhasmakūta 5519 and that the pilgrim to Gayā can offer a pinda to himself only when it is certain that he has no son or other adhıların for offering śrāddha. Further, any one related or udrelated, could offer a pinda 1520 to anybody, as laid down in Vayu 'Whether it is one's own son or the son of another (sylio offers), in whosesoever name a pinda is let fall at Gayā, that man attains everlasting Brahma It is desired that anyone may offer a pioda to anybody after uttering that person's Dame and gobra and the latter reaches the highest goa]'

Raghunandana on Gayā-śrāddha paddhati) published in Bengali characters. Then I consulted two mss. viz the Gaya-śrāddha-paddbati of Raghunatha son of Mādhara (D. C.mas. No. 93 of 1891-95) and the Gayāśrāddha-vidhi of Vācaspati (D. C No 245 of 1887-91). The procedure in the Tirthayātrā-tattya of Raghunandaza is set out here briefly with out actually citing in full the Vāyupurāṇa passages which it quotes profusely. Raghunandana appears to follow the Tirtha cintamani closely as some of the notes will show. After the pilgrim enters Gayā he sliould first make an appropriate sankalpa1521 for a bath in Phalgu, take the olay from the river, apply it to his body and bathe Then he should perform tarpana2522 to the twelve male and female ancestors (specified in note 1516 abore) Then he should declare a sankalpa that he would per form Gayāśrāddha with the words 'Omladyetyādi Gayatirtha prapti-nimittaka-śrāddhamalam karisye'. Then he should per form & pūrvana-srāddha (described above pp. 485-505) excepting the āvāhana and arghya rites If the pilgrim be unable to per form all the details of śrāddha, he may offer only pindas. Then on the same day he should go to the Pretasila which adjoins the west bank of the river Phalgu and is to the north of Gaya and perform srāddha there as follows: he should perform the purification of the ground, sit down on it, perform ācamana, face the south, rear the sacred thread in the apasavya form, recite the verses (Vāyu 110 10-12 'Kavyavalo...śraddbenānena śāśvatīm), conternplate on his pitrs, perform prānāyāma, sprinkle water on the materials for stāddha after remembering Pundarīkāksa (Visnu), make the sankalpa (set out in note 1516). Ele should go through the whole procedure of srāddha up to the payment of daksipā to brāhmanas. After this he should sit to the south of the altar (where he performed the śrāddha), should wear the sacred thread in the apasavya form, face the south, place on the ground three kuśas and after reciting the mantra ( Vāyu 110, 10-12 ) should make an invocation once in the form of offering an añjal of Vater mixed with sesame, then honour the father Frith padya (water for washing the feet), recite the two verses

[Vol. (Vayu 110. 20-21 Sa brahma., tilodakam' with om prefixed ), perform invocation as before of the father and others with water in, folded hands and should offer a pioda to bis father of pāyasa or other material mixed with sesame, water and honey with the words 'Om, adya amuka-gotra pitar-ainukadevaśar man, esa to pipdah svadba'. In this way he should offer pinda to the remaining eleven devatās, viz. paternal grandfather and others (or eight or five according to usage). He should donate A fee according to his means. Then he should sit to the south of the place he so far occupied, spread on the ground kusag having roots but with tips turned to the south, should repeat the mantras (Vāyu 110 10-12), perform on those kuśas once an invocation in the form of an anjalı of water mixed with sesame, repeat the two verses (Vayu 110. 22-23 'Pitā pitāmaha...mupatisthatām' with om prefixed 1522a) and shonld offer one pinda made of one handful of barley flour mixed with sesame, kuśas, ghee, ourds, water and honey to all the twelve devatās ( ancestors) together. Then follows what is called Sodaśīkarma, which is as follows, Nineteen spots for pindaṣ should be made (each to the south of the preceding) and should be smeared with pañcagavya one after another; then he should spread over each kuśas with their tips to the south, should invoke on the kuśas the persons intended with the mantras (Vāyu 110. 30-32 asmat-kule mrta... bijodakaih '). should worship them by offering sandalwood paste and the rest, (and if he is performing the rite of sodasi on a spot sacred to a specific deity then worship that deity also with an appropriate mantra ), should then offer once as before an anjal of water mixed with sesame and offer pindas beginning from the first spot, each pinda being offered after reciting each of the 19 mantras (Vāyu 110. 34-55, omitting 110,44 'asipatra o', 110.46 

anekayātanā-samsthāh ye nitā o', and treating 52-53 as one meotra and 54-55 as one mantra)15226, He should offer 19 pindas 

1522 a It sbould be noted that om is to be recited before each verse intended as maofra here and below. 

2522 b. The Tir C, (pp 290-292) sisghtly differs. It does sociude Vayu 110. 46 and treats tbe three verses (Vāyu 110 51-53) as one mantra It is difficult to understand why the writers of digests did not say that the śrāddhasodasi should be performed witb only 18 mantras from out of the 21 or 22 yerses with option to the reciter, Where the maatras exceed the number required, Jaumini X. 5 14 states teria a re facing farfare amarelo: Raghupandana reads the five verses (51-55) somewhat differeatly from the printed Vāyupurana, thoagh the sense is not much affected ,IV) Raghunandana's procedure of Gaya-śraddha 673 

of the size already stated and made of the material already mentioned with the sacred thread in the apasavya form. Raghu nandana explains that although there are nineteen pindas still this is called śrāddhasodaśī as a technical term,1573 It would be noticed that all the mantras refer to males in the words 'ye', 'te', 'tebhyah. So this is 'Pum-sodasi,' There is a strī-sodasi' also which only involves changing the words of the mantras in the masculine to words in the feminine gender as indicated in the Vāyuputāna itself. 1524 Otherwise there is no difference between the two (pumsodaśī and strisodasi ). The note belosy states the mode in which both males and females are to be invoked and gratified. 

Water should be sprinkled over all pindas three times with & vessel full of water mixed with sesame. The mantras repeated at the time are quoted below in the note, 1525 Then he prostrates himself on the ground and should dismiss (send away) them (the persons invoked) with the words 'O father and others 1 forgive me.' Then wearing the sacred thread in the savya form, he should sip water (perform acamana) and recite with his face to the east the two mantras (Vāyu 110.59-60 'sāksipaḥ santu," and 'āgatosmı Gayām'). If a pilgrim is unable to carry out all this lengthy procedure, he should at least offer pindas on Pretaśilā, by making a sankalpa (like the one in note 1516 saying 'pindadānam' for śrāddham'). He should wear the sacred thread in the apasavya mode and repeat the verses in Vayu (110. 10-12 and 110.59-60) and should perform according to his sūtra the various iteros such as drawing lines on the altar meant for placing pindas, spreading kuśas, sprinkling down water on the pindas, the offering of pindas, re-sprinkling

Then the pilgrim should descend from the hill (Pretaśila) to the ground below and should bathe in the deep pool well known as Ramatirtha 1525 (which is in the form of Prabhāsa. hrada) at the meeting place of the great river (Phalgu) with the Prabhāsa bill after making a sapkalpa (as given in the foot note ) and after repeating the mantra 'janmāntarasatam' (Vāyu 108 18). He should then perform tarpana and perform śrāddha or (if unable to offer sraddha) offer only pindas accord. ing to the procedure of his own grupasūtra. He should offor as done in the Pretaśilā śrāddha twelve pindas to the father and the others, the siogle inexhaustible pinda and the sodasi pindas If he cannot go through all these,' he may perform any one of them. Then he should make a sankalpa and should offer obeisance to Rawa with the mantra 'Rama Rāma'(Vayu 108,20). When a pilgrim performs this bath, śrāddha and pindadāna kis pitrs become free from the condition of being preta (Vāgu 108. 21). Then he should perform obejbance to the refulgong Prabhāsesa (Siva). He should offer obeisance to both Rārar and Prabhāsesa with the mantra 'āpastyamasi' (Vāyu 108. 22) Then he should offer a balt of boiled rice to Yama with the words "this is a bali, om) bow to Yama.' Then on a hill called Naga situated to the south of Prabhāsa hill and on the middle of Prataśılā he should recite the verse 'dvau śvānau' (Vāgu 108.30) and offer a bali made up of some kind of cooked food with the words 'this is a bali to Yamarāja and Bhramarāja (Dharma rāja?); salutation. This offering of bali is obligatory on every pilgrim); the rest may be done according to one's ability. This finishes the rites on the first day (i, e, the day of entoring Gayā). 

On the 2nd day of entering Gayā the pilgrim should bathio in Phalgu, perform his daily duty of tarpana and sorship of gods and then in the afternoon bathe in Brahmakunda 151 situated in the north-east corner which touches the root of Pretaparvata, that is at the distance of a gavyūti from Gaga and that (Brabmalcupda) is situated to the nortli-west of Gasā,

Then he should with the face to the south throw on Pretapar vata barley grains mixed with sesame with the mantra 'ye kecit" (Vāyu 110 63 g both by Tīr, C. p. 297 and by Raghunandana) and offer an añjali of water mixed with sesame with the mantra tā-brahma' (Vāyu 110-64).1528 

On the third day after entering Gayā come the rites of Pañcatirthi described above,(pp. 663-666). The pilgrim bathes 1529 in the Uttaramānasa with the mantra uttare mānase snānam' (Vāyu 111. 2-3). He should offer one añjali with the Terses (Vayu 110. 20-21) and perform śrāddha, After this śrāddha be sits to the south of Uttara-mānasa, spreads Kusas with tips towards the south, offers water with sesame and offers to all together one pinda of one handful of barley flour mixed with sesamo, kuśas, honey, curds and water Then he bows to and worships the Sun's image on Uttaramānasa with the mantra 'namostu bhānave' (Vāyu 111 5). Then he repairs to Daksinamānasa in silence and there takes a bath in Udici tirtha, in Kanakhala and then in Daksinamānasa with the mantra (Vāyu 111 9-10) and then performs salutation and vorship to Daksipārka, then makes a bow to Maunārka, then goes to Phalgu tirtha situated to the east of Gadadhara and takes a bath and performs tarpana and śrāddha there; then be Worships Pitāmaha (with Vāyu 111. 19), visits Gadādhara and worships (with Vāyu 111.21), then again goes to the five tirthas, at each of which he bathes and performs tarpana Then he bathes the image of Gadadhara with pancāmrta. Raghu nandang notes that the bathing of Gadadhara with pancāmrta is obligatory, while the rest may be done according to one's ability. This finishes the rites of pañcatirthi,

History of Dharmaśāstru 

[ Voi. nandana will alone be specified here. After bath and śrāddha at Matangavāpi, the pilgrim should go to Matangeśa to the north of Matangavāpi and recite Vāyu 111, 25 (pramānam devatāh santū &c). When pouring water at the root of the mango tree established by Brahma the pilgrim repeats Vāya 111, 36 (āmram brahma-sarodbhūtam &c.). When boving to Brahmā, the mantra is Vāyu 111. 34 (namo brahmane &c.). The bali to Yama is offered with Vāyu 111, 38 (Yamarāja dharmarājau &c.). The bali to the two dogs is to be given with the mantra (Vāyu 111, 39) and that to the crows with Vāyu 111. 40 (Aindra-vāruna-vāyavya &c). As regards the padas the pilgrim should begin with Rudrapada and perform śrāddha there and then proceed to Visnupada and worship Visnu with five upacaras1530 with the mantra 'Idam Visnur-vi cakrame' (Rg. I. 22. 17). To the south of the vedi of Vispupada he should perform the śrāddhasodasi (described above pp 672-673) up to Vāyu 110, 60 (anrnosham-rpatrayāt). About an ascetic, vide above p. 655 

Then Raghunandana briefly touches upon the sraddhas to be performed at the several padas and remarks that the last śrāddha at the padas is that at Kasyapapada. He prescribes Vayu 11). 76 as the mantra for bath in Gadalola-tirtha. Then he states that the srāddha at the Aksayavata is to be performed on the north side of the Vata near ats bottom. He prescribes Vāyu 111. 82-83 (ekārnave &c ) as the mantras for bowing to the Aksayavata Further, he speaks of śrāddhas to be performed at several sub-tirthas, such as Gayatri, Sarasvati, Vikāla, the hermitage of Bharata, Mundaprstha. Then he prescribes that the pilgrim should cross the Vartarani (situated to the east of the Devanadi which is near Bhasmakūta) with the mantra (Vāyu 105.44, yāgau Vaitaradi nāma &c). After referring to several other tirthas such as Gopracāra, Ghrtakulyā, Madhu. kulya, Raghunandana recommends that the pilgrim should visit Pānduśılā (which is in Campakavana near Pitamaha) and perform sraddha there He notes that the four rivers and streams called Ghrtakulya, Madhukulyā, Devika and Mahānadi 1931 (Phalgu) are called Madhusravā when they meet the Sulā (Vāyu

112.30) and a bath, tarpana and śrāddha thereon yield immense results, Then are mentioned several other tirthas such as Daśāśvanedba, Matangapada, Makha-kunda (near Udyanta parvata), Gayākūta, Raghunandana winds up by providing that on Bhasmakūta the pilgrim should place with his right hand in the hand of Janardana a pinda mixed with curds (but without sesame) and on doing so recite five verses (Vāyu 108, 86-90, 1532 'eṣa pindo maya' &c.). Then Raghunandana quotes *sixteen verses about Mātrsodası (which do not ocour in Vāyu 

purāna and are passed over here). 

We have to distinguish between Gayākgetra, Gayā and Gayāśiras or Gayāśīrsa. The Vayu, Agni and Nāradiya all assert that Gayāksetra is five krośas 1533 (in extent) and Gayā. śiras is one krośa. It had become the fashion to speak of famous tirthas like Kāśi and Prayāga as pañcakrosa. But so far as the Vāyupurāna is concerned the Gayāksetra is about 13 miles in length from Pretaśilā to Mahābodhi tree as shown above Gayā is said to be two krośas and a half in extent in all directions from Mundaprstha 1534, Gayāśiras is smaller than Gayā and is identified with Phalgutīrtha (vide note 1499). Gajā and Gayasiga (Pāli for Gayāśirsa) are well known to ancient Buddhist texts (Mahāvagga I 21. 1 in S. B. E. XIII p. 136, Anguttaranikāya, toxt vol IV. p. 302). Vide n. 1510 

Four of the most important and holy tirthas have been dealt with at some length so far. It is not possible in the space allotted to the section on tirthas to pursue the same procedure as regards other famous tirthas. It is proposed to devote a few pages to each of half a dozen or more tirthas and then to give a somewhat comprehensive list of tirthas with a few references in the case of each. But before proceeding further reference must be made to certain popular groupings of tirthas. There is a group of seven cities that are deemed to be very holy and 

1532. Raghunandada reads the five verses somewhat differently from the priated Vāyapurāna, though the sense is not much affected.
