CHAPTER XV 

KURUKSETRA AND SOME OTHER FAMOUS 

TĪRTHAS 

KURUKSETRA (25 miles east of Ambala) is a very sacred tract, the history of which is lost in the mists of anti quity. In the Rgveda X.33.4 there is a reference to a king Kuruśravada, son of Trasadasyu.1538 The Atharva-veda men. tions a Kauravya husband (probably a king) who had a talk with his wife 2539 In the times of the Brāhmadas Kuruksetra had become a very holy land. The Sat. Br. (IV. 1, 5.13) narrates the legend that the gods performed a sacrifice in Kuruksetta and at first excluded the two Aśvins from any share in it (S. B. E vol. 26 p. 275). The Maitrāyani Samhita (IL. 1. 4., dova yai sattramāsata Kuruksetre) and the Tai, Br. (V. 1. 1., devā vai sattram-asata tesām Kurukgetram vedir-āsīt) also say that the Gods performed a satira in Kuruksetra. The idea underlying these passages appears to be this. The Vedic people of the Brāhmana period held yajñas to be the dharma par ercellence, as stated in Rg. X. 90. 16 (yajñena yajñam-ayajanta devāstānı dharmāpi prathamanyāsan). Kuruksetre was the centre of Vedic culture in the Brahmana period and sacrifices must have been performed there un a large scale. Hence it was called dharmaksetra and as gods were supposed to have attained their position by what men believed to be dharma (vajña, tapas &c.) it is stated that gods performed sattras in Kuruksetra, The sams Brahmapa mentions & Kauravya king Bablika Pratipiya (XIL 9.3.3, S. B, E, vol. 44 p. 269). The Tsi. Br. (I 8.4.1) ipforms us that the Kuru-Pañcālas went towards the east in winter (Śzbira) and to the west in summer which was the worst season. The references in the Ait. Br. are far more instructive, The legend about Kavasa in which Sarasvati helps the sage has already been referred to above (p. 559 n. 1254). The Ait. Br. (8.1 or I 19) calls that place, where Sarasvati came rushing, 'Parisaraka'. In another place the Ait, Br, tells us that in its time Nyagrodba (Ficus India) was called Nyubza in Kuru

Ancient references to Kuruh setra

ksetra.1540 Elsewhere the sit. Br. speaks of the countries of the Kurus and Pañcālas together with the Vaśa-Usinaras (38. 3-VII. 14). The Tai Ā, narrates 1541 that the gods performed 8 sattra and Kuruksetra was their altar (for the sattra). The southern side of that Vedi (1. e. Kuruksetra) was Khandava, the northern side was Tūrguna, the hinder part was Paridab, and the country of Maru (desert) was the rubbisa pit. This shows that Khāndaya, Tūrghna and Paridab were border parts of Kuruksetra and the Maru district was somewhat away from Kuruksetra. The Srautasūtras of Aśy. XI 6, Latyāyana X. 15 ft and Katyāyana 1542 24 6 5 ff closely follow Tāndya and other Brāhmanas and mention several holy places at which parts of the Sārasvata sattras were performed such as Plaksa Prasravana where Sarasvati starts, the Vaitandhaya-hrada of Sarasvati, the tract called Parinah in Kuruksetra, Yamunā flowing through the country of Kārapacaya and the country of Triplaksāyaharana, 

In the, Chandogya Upanisad (I. 10.1 ff) occurs the story of Usasti Cākrāyana who, when the Kuru country was struck by hailstorms, lived with his very young wife in Ibhyagrāma and went begging for food, 

The Nirukta (IL. 10) explains that 1543 Devāpi and Santanu mentioned in Rgveda X, 98.5 and 7 were historical persons and were brothers, sons of Rstisena, a king of Kuru. Panini (IV. 1. 151 and IV.1 172) explains the formation of the word Kaurarya from Kuru', the first in the sense of 'apatya', the second in the sense of 'king, '1544

[Vol. The Mahabhārata frequently speaks of the high sanctify ing virtues of Kuruksetra. It appears that the territory to the south of Sarasvati and to the north of Disadvati was included in Kuruksetra and 1545 that those who resided thorein were as if residents of paradise. Kuruksetra appears to be called Brabmīverta in Vanaparva 86.6. According to the Vāmanapurāpa, Kurujāngala is 1546 the country bettyeen the Sarasvati and Drsadyati, wbile Manu (IL 17, 18) defines Brahmāvarta as the country created by God between the two divine rivers Sarasvati and Drsadvati, states that Brahmarsi, deśa which is slightly less (in koliness) than Brabmāvarta comprises Kuruksetra, the countries of Matsya, Pañcala and Sūrasena. From these passages it is clear that Brahmavarta is the holiest country in Aryavarta and that Kuruksetra was almost like it; we have seen that in the times of the Brab manas the most sacred Sarasvati flowed through Kuruksetra and that the place wbere Sarasvati disappeared in the desert was called Vinaśana and was itself a very holy place, Origi mally the land called Kuruksetra is said to have been the Vedi (sacrificial altar ) 1547 of Brahmā, then it came to be called Samantapañcaka (or syamanta-in some passages) when Paraśn rāma made five pools of the blood of ksatriyas in royenge for his father's murder, which were subsequently turned into holy pools of water by the blessings of his pitrs and lastly it came to be called Kuruksetra whea king Kuru, son of Samyarada! ploughed the land with a golden plough for seven krośas all round. Kuruksetra is so called after king Kuru. Kuru is said

to have asked of Indra the boon that the territory he ploughed might be 'Dharmaksetra' (domain of righteousness) and that those who may bathe or die there may reap a rich harvest of merit 1549 The war between Kurus and Pāndavas vas fought there. It is spoken of as 'Dharmaksetra' in the opening verse of the Bhagavad-gīta. Kurujāngala is said to be a very fit country for śrāddha in Vayu (77, 93) and Kūrma II 20. 33 and 37. 36-37. In the 7th century the Chinese traveller Hiouen Thsang speaks of the country, the capital of which was Sthān visvara (modern Thanesat which is the heart of Kuruksetra) as the 'land of religious merit' (Beal's B. R. W. W. vol. I p. 184). 

The extent of Kuruksetra is said to be five yojanas in radius (in Vanaparva, and the Vamana Parāda) 1550. A some what corrupt verse occurs in the Mahabhārata and some purānas 1551 about the limits of Kuruksetra viz. the territory between Tarantu and Karantuka and between Macakruka (image of a yaksa) and the Rama-hradas (pools made by Para surāma)- this is Kuruksetra, Samantapancaka and the nor thern vedi of Brahmā. The result is that Kuruksetra is referr. ed to under various names viz. Brahmasaras, Rāmahrada, Samantapancaka, Vinasana, Sannihati (vide T. Pr. p. 463). For the boundaries of Kuruksetra, vide Cunningham's A S. R. of India, vol. XIV pp 86-106 where he notes that Kuruksetra was 30 miles to the south of Ambala and 40 miles to the north of Panipat. In the remote past Kuruksetra was the centre of

History of Dhar maśāstra 

[Vol. all the activities and the culture of the Vedic people. Gradually the Vedic people spread towards the east and south and the country between the Ganges and Jumgā and later on Videha (or Mithila) became the centres of Indian culture. 

For reasons of space it is not possible to dwell at length on the greatness and sanctity of Kuruksetra as described in the Mahābhārata and the Purāṇas Vanaparva 83 starts by say ing that all beings that are in Kuruksetra are freed from all sins and that he also who always says 'I shall go to Kuru ksetra, and I shall reside in Kuruksetra' is freed from sins 1552 *In this world there is no place holier than this. Even the particles of dust driven from Kuraksetra by the yind take a great sinner to the highest goal' 1553 Even the Ganges is com pared to Kuruksetra (vide note 1324 'Kuruksetrasama Gapgā"). The Naradiya avers 1534 that planets, constellations and stars are subject to the danger of falling down (from the sky) in course of time, but in the case of those that die in Kuruksetra there is no falling on the earth again (i e, they would not be born again). 

It is a remarkable fact that though the Vapaparya 10 chap. 83 enumerates several tirthas on the Sarasvati and 10 Kuruksetra, they do not at all tally with the tirthas mentioned in the Brāhmabas and the Srautasūtras (except Vinasana which is mentioned in Vanaparra 83.11 and probably Saraka which may be identified with Parisaraka of the Ait, Br.). This means that the Panaparva account of Sarasvati and Kuruksetra is later by some centuries than that in the Srautasūtras, The Nāradiya (uttara, chap. 65 ) names about one hundred tirthas in Kurukse tra. It is - not possible to get out all of them, But a few words may be said about some of them. First comes the lake called Brahmasaras or Pavana-hrada (Vanaparya 83. 85, Vāmana 49. 38-41, Nāradiya, uttara 65 95) on

Suo-tirthas under Kuruksetra which Kuru stayed as an ascetic, A G (pp. 334-335 ) remarks that the lake is 3546 feet long east to west and 1900 feet wide north to south. The Vamanapurāpa (2%. 50-55) describes it at soine length and says that it was half & yojana in extent. Cakratirtha (mentioned by Vāmajapurana 42.5, 57. 89 and 81. 3) is popularly supposed to be the place where Krsna took up the discus for attacking Bhisma, Vyāsas. thali 1555 (named in Vanaparva 84 96, Nāradiya, uttarardha 65. 83 and Padma I 26. 90-91) is the same as modero Basthali, 17 miles to the south-west of Thanesar where Vyāsa resolved to'die on the loss of his son. Asthipura (Padma, Adi 27, 62) is on the west of Thanesar and south of Aujasa ghāt where the bodies of the warriors killed in the Great Bhārata var vere cremated. Cunningham in Archaeological Survey Reports of India vol. II. p. 219 states that Cakratirtha is the same as Asthipura and that in Alberuni's time it was the most famous shrine in Kuruksetra. Prthūdaka on the Saras. vati is very highly spoken of in Vanaparva 83, 142-149. "They say 1556 that Kuruksetra is holy, that Sarasvati is holier than Kuruksetra, that the sacred spots (on Sarasvati) are holier than the river Sarasvati and that Prthūdaka is bolier than all the other tirthas on Sarasvati. There is no tīrtha that is better than Prthūdaka'. The Salyaparya1557 remarks that whoever, while intently engaged in repeating holy texts, abandons his life at Prthūdaka on the northern bank of the Sarasvati vould not be troubled by death next day (i, o, he would be free from birth and death) The Vamanapurana (39.20 and 23) calls it Brahma yopitirtha. Pithūdaka is modern Pehova in the Karnal Dist. rict in Panjab, 14 miles to the west of Thanesar. Vide E.I. vol. I, p. 184 for the Pehova inscription from the temple of Garibnath dated in samvat 276 (of the Harsa Era) i e, 882-883 A.

The Vamanapurāna (34,3 ff) and Nāradiya (uttarardha 65. 4-7) enumerate geven forests existing in Kuruksetra as very holy and as destroyers of all sins, viz. Kāmyabar Aditivana, Vyāsavana, Phalakivana, Sūryavana, Madhuvana and Sita. vana. Vide A. S. R. for India, Vol. 14 pp. 90-91 for the vanas. In the Salyaparva (chap. 38) it is said that the world is encom passed by seven Sarasvatis, then they are enumerated and their locations are specified viz. Suprabhā (in Puskara, where Brahmā engaged in a great sacrifice remembered her, verse 13), Kāñcanāksi (in the Naimisa forest, v. 19), Vibāja (jnvoked by Gaya in the Gayā country, verses 20-21), Manoramā (in Auddalaka's yajña in Uttarakosala, verses 22-25), Surenu (in Rsabhadvipa in Kuru's yajña, verses 26-27), Oghayati (called by Vasistha in Kuruksetra, verses 27-28), Vimalodā (when Brahmā again performed a yajña in the Himalaya). In the Vāmanapurāra 34, 6-8 geven rivers in connection with Sarag. yati are said to be very holy (but nine are actually enumerated) viz, Sarasvati, Vaitarani, Apagā, Ganga-Mandakini, Madhu Brava, Ambunadi, Kausiki, Drsadyati and Hiranvati, 

Kuruksetra was also called Sannihati or Sannihalyā. Vide those words in the list of tirthas. The Vāmanapurāna (32, 3-4) says that Sarasvati springs from a plaksa tree, that after pier cing many hills it enters Dvaitavana. Vāmana (32. 6-22) "contains a eulogy of Sarasvati by Mārkandeya. Alberuni (Sachau, vol. I. p. 261) states that the river Sarasvati falls into the sea at the distance of a bowshot east of Sompāth. There is a small but holy stream called Sarasvati, that rises in the - Mahilanthe hills and after crossing the south-east corner of Palanpur Agency passes by Siddhapura and Patan, flows under. ground for some miles and then enters the Runn of Cuick (Bom, G, vol. V. p.,283).15570 

MATHURA 

Till now it has not been possible to trace an express Vedic Ieference to Mathurā, the chief oity of the country of Sūrasena. But its existence from at least the 5th century B C. appears

Antiquity of Mathurā to rest on firm ground. It is stated in the Anguttaranikāya 

(I. 167, skam samayam ayasmā Mahākaccano Madhurāyam' viharati Gundāvane) and Majjhima (IT. 84 same words) that Mahakaccāyana, a famous disciple of Buddha, assiduously preached in Mathurā the principles of his Master. Megas thenes appears to have known Mathurā and its connection with Heracles 1558 (Elari-Krsna?). The word "Māthura' (meaning a resident of Mathurā, or born in or coming from Mathura) occurs in Jaimini's Pūrva-nimānsā-sūtra 1559 Though Panini's sūtras do not expressly mention Mathurā, the latter is included in the Varanādi-gana (Pān. IV. 2. 82), Pānini is, however, aware of Vasudeva and Arjuna (IV. 3, 98), the Andhaka and Vrsni clans of Yadavas to which Krsna belonged (IV.1. 114) and probably knew the name Govinda (IIL1. 138 and vārtika 'gavi ca vindeh sanjñāyām"). Mathurā is several times mention ed by the Mahābhāṣya of Patañjali who 1560 in a famous passage refers to dramatic representations, paintings and stories which depict the destruction of Kamsa by Vasudeva, He also cites a quarter of a verse about the killing of Kamsa by Vasudeva as a well-known past event. Whether the town Saurya mentioned in the Mahabhāsya on Vārtika 2 on Padini L. 4,7 (Sauryam ca Ketayatā ca Saurya-Ketavate) is the same as Mathurā is doubtful, even though the Uttaradhyayanasūtra speaks of Mathurā as Sauryapura (S. B. E. vol. 45 p. 112). The Adiparva (221. 46) indicates that Mathura was famed for excellent cows 

1558. Vide McCradle's 'Megasthenes and Arrian' p. 201 where it 18 said that Heracles was held in special honour by the Saurasepoi tribe (Sūrasena) which possessed two large cities, Mathura and Kleisobora (Krsnapura?), wbile Ptolemy calls at Nodoura of the gods' (vide Mc Criadle's 'Ancient India as described by Ptolemy', ed, of 1927, p. 124).

When Hamsa and Dimbhaka, brave command ers of Jarāsandha, drowned themselves in the Jumnā and when Jarasandha sorrowfully went to Magadha Krspa gays 've shall again joyfully reside in Mathurā* (Sabhāparva 14. 41-45), Ultimately Krsna is said to have left Mathura owing to the constant attacks of Jarasandha and established the Yādavas in Dvāraka 1561 (Sabhāparva, 14. 49-50 and 67). The Brabma purāna, on the other hand, states that the Vrspis and Andha kas on the advice of Krsna loft Mathurā through the fear of KalayavanaVide also Vi. V. 23. 8-15. The Vayu (88.185) states that Satrughna, the brother of Rāma, killed the demon Layana, son of Madhu and established Mathura in Madhuyana while the Rāmāyaba (Uttara-kānda 70. 6-9) informs us that Satrughna took twelve years to make Mathura a fine and pros perous city, , In the Ghata-Jātaka (Fausböll, vol. IV. pp. 79-89 No, 454) Mathurā is called Uttara Madhurā (to distinguish it from Madhurā of the Pārdyas in the south) and the story of Kamsa and Vasudeva is narrated, which differs in some material points from the Mahābhārata and the Purāṇas. In the Raghuvamsa XV.28 it is mentioned as Madhurā and as founded by Satrughna. Hiouen Thsang states that in Mathura there'existed in his day three stūpas built by Asokarāja, that there were in Mathurā five Deva temples, 20 sanghūrāmas (Buddhist contents) with 2000 Buddhist priests (Beal's B. R. W, W. vol. I p 179 ). James Allan (in Catalogue of the coins of Ancient India' 1936, p. CXVI) states that the coins of the Hindu kings of Mathurā cover the period from the begin ning of the 2nd century B. C to the middle of the first century B. O, For some ancient coins from Mathurā, the Cambridge History of India, vol. I, p. 538 and plate V (No. 5-10) may be referred to, 'An interesting and informative work is 'Mathura' by FS. Growse (2nd ed. 1880). Inscriptions contribute important evidence about the history and antiquity of Mathurā. 1562 The famous inscription of Khāravela (E. ). pol.

Inscriptions on Mathurā 

689 

Inscriptions of suoh Kuṣāna rulers as Kaniska, Huviska and others relating to Mathurā have been published of which the following may be mentioned: Inscription on a Naga image at Mathurā of 'Mahārāja-rājātirāja Kanikkha' in samvat 8 (E 1. vol. 17. p. 10) 1563; the Mathurā pedestal Inscription of Kaniska in the 14th year (E. I, VOL. 19 p. 96); inscription on the pedestal of the image of a seated Bodhisattva at Mathura in the reign of Huviska in sainvat 33 (E I vol. 8 pp. 181–182); Inscription of & king Vāsu (rest of the name lost) of the year 74 (E. I. vol. 9 p. 241) and of the time of Sondāsa (E. I vol. 9 p. 246); seven Brahmi inscriptions from Mathura and its vicinity (E. I. vol. 24 pp. 194-210) There is further an interesting inscription recording the dedication of a stone slab in the temple of Nagendra Dadhikarna by Nandibala and other sons of some actor (Śailālaka) brothers of Mathurā (E. I. vol. I, at p. 390). From the Viṣṇu-purāna VI. 8. 31 it follows that an image of Hari had been installed in Mathura before that purāna was composed, The Vayupuçāpa 1564 informs us in a prophetic vein that seven Naga kings will rule over Mathurā, Prayāga, Sāketa and Magadha before the Guptas. Alberuni's India (vol. I, p. 147) states that Maharā (Mathurā) is crowded with brāhmanas, 

From the above brief historical sketch it would appear that Mathurā was, five or six centuries before Christ, a flourish ing city where the epic Hinduism prevailed, that later on Buddhism and Jainism dominated it, that there must have been a revival of Hinduism under the Nāga and Gupta emperors, that in the 7th century A. D., when Hiouen Thsang wrote, Hinduism and Buddhism were equally prominent and that in the 11th century A. D. it was completely dominated by the Brahmanic faith. 

The Agnipurāna furnishes the strange information that Bharata at the command of Rama killed three crores of the sons of Sailūsa in the city of Mathurā 1565. Mathurā has been

History of Dharmaśāstra the centre of Krsna worship and of Bhagavatism for over two thousand years. The Vazāha-purāpa devotes about ong thou Band verses to the greatness of Mathura and its sub-tirthas (chap. 152–178). The Brhan-nāradiya, chapters 79-80, Bhāga vata X and Viṣṇu-purāna V-VI devote much space to Krsna, Radhā, Mathurā, Vrndāvana, Govardhana and Krsna's exa ploits there. 

Hor want of space only a few verses about Mathurā will be set out here. The Padma (Ādikhanda 29. 46-47) says "Yamunā gives mokse when united with Mathurā; Yamunā gives rise to great merit in Mathurā and when united to Mathurā it bestows devotion to Viṣṇu'. In the Varahapurāna (152, 8, 11) Viṣṇu gays "There is no place either in the nether regions or on the earth or in mid air as daar to me as Mathura, Mathura is a famous ksetra of mine that confors muldi; no place is to me higher than it. It is my birth-place and it is lovely, oom mendable and dear to me'. The Padma says 'Mathuraka is a name extremely dear to Vispu'. The Harivemśa contains a fine description of Mathurā, one verse from which may be quoted hore 'Mathuri is the hump (1 a. the most eminent spot) of Madhyadeśa, it is simply the abode of the goddess of wealth, it is the horn (1. e. the most prominent part) of the earth, thera is nothing like it and it is endowed with abundant wealth and agricultural produce : 1566 

The tract round about Mathurā is said to be 20 yojanas in extent and the city of Mathura was in its midst 1567. The Varahapurāna and the Nāradiya (uttarārdha) chapters 79-80 mention numerous tirthas in and about Mathura. It is not possible to enumerate them here. A few important ones will be noticed briefly. Both Varāba (chap. 153 and 161 6-10) and Nāradiya (uttarārdha 79. 10-18) mention twelve forests near Mathurā viz. Madhu, Tāla, Kumuda, Kāmaya, Bahula, Bhadra, 

(Continued from the last page) actor Has this anything to do with a dispute between the followers of Bharata, the reputed author of the Natyasastra, and other actors? The Natyasastra chap. 17. 47 (G.0.5) prefers the dialect of Sūraseda for dramas, Vide my 'History of of Sanskrit Poetics' P 40 (1951).

Khadira, Mahāvana, Lohajangha, Bilya, Bhāndita and Vrndāvana. There are also 24 upavanas enumerated by Growse on 'Mathura' (p. 76) which are not mentioned by the Purāṇas but only by later works. Yrndāvana 1568 was to the north-west . of Mathurā on the Yamunā and was five yojanas in extent (Vispupurāpa V. 6. 28-40, Nāradiya, uttarardha 80. 6,8 and 77). It was the scene of Krsna's adventures and love-making The Padma IV. 69 9 speaks of it as a portion of Vaikuntha on the earth. The Matsya (13.38) identifies Radha in Vrndāvana as Depi Dāksāyan),1569 In Kālidāsa's day it had great fame. In Raghuvamsa VI, wbile describing Susena of the Nipa family, king of Sūrasena, Vrndāvana is said to be no less charming than Caitraratha, the park of Kubera (verse 50). Then there is the Govardhana 1570 hill, which Krona lifted up on his little finger to afford shelter for seven days to the cowherds and their cattle against the heavy rains sent down by Indra (Vispupurāna V.11. 15-25). It is stated in the Varābapurana (164 1) that Govardhana is about two yojanas from Mathura to its west. This appears to be tolerably correct as at present it is 18 miles from Vrndāvana. The Kūrma (I. 14 18) says that the very ancient king Prthu performed austerities here. The details given in the Hari-yamsa and the Purāṇas are sometimes confused and misleading. For example, in the Harivamsa (Vispuparya 13.3) it is stated that Tālavana is to the north of Govardhana on the Yamunā, while it is south-east of Govar dhana Kālidasa refers to the caverns of Govardhana (Raghu. vamga 6. 51). Gokula is the same as Vraja or Mahāvana, where

1569. Dey (p. 42) regards the identity of the modern Vrodzvada which is only 6 miles from Mathorā (10 the opposite direction to Gokula) with the ancient Vrndiyana described in the Parānas as extremely doubtful on several grounds, the most cogeat being that cocient Vrndāvana and Mathurā appear to bave been situated on opposite sides of the Yamuna, while modern Vrodāvans and Mathura are on the same side of the river But the references be gives for this last statement viz Vissuporāna 5 18 33 and Bhagavatapurāna X. 39. 34 do not in my opinion bear out what he says, The Nāradiya (II, 80 6-7) appears to say that Vrodzvana is near Govardhana and along the Yamunā and Naddigrāma

I Vol. Krsna was brought up in his early childhood by Nand-gopa who removed his habitation from Gokula to Vrndāvana out of fear of what Kamsa might do. The great Vaisnavite saint Caitanya visited Vrndāvana (Caitanya-caritāmrta canto 19 and 9th Act of the drama Caitanyačandrodaya, both by Kapikarna pūra or Paramānandadāsa). In the 16th century Vrndāvana became a centre of Caitanya's bhakti movement owing to the strenuous efforts and learned writings of the Gosvamins of Vrndāvana, particularly Sanatana, Rūpa and Jiya. Vide Prof. S, K, De's 'Vaisnava faith and movement in Bengal' (1942) pp. 83–122. Vallabhācārya, who was a contemporary of Caitanya founded new Gokula, one mile to the south of Mahapana in imitation of the ancient Gokula. Caitanya and Vallabhācārya met at Vrndāvana (vide Manilal O. Parekh's work on Vallabhācārya p. 161). The old temples of Mathura met the game fate at the orders of Aurangzeb as the temples of Banaras, 1572 

The Sabhāparva (319. 23-25) narrates that Jarasandha threv his mace from Girivraja (Rajgir in Bihar, the ancient capital of Magadha) and it fell in Mathurā at the diatance of 99 yojanas before Krspa and the place where it fell vag thence called Gadāvasāna, I have not come across this name anywhero else. 

Growse describes in chap. IX pp. 222 ff. the templos of Vindāyana and in chap. XI Govardhana, Barsān, the birth place of Radha, and Nandgaon. Vide also 'Picturesque India' by W, S Caine pp. 253 ff. for Mathurā and neighbouring holy places, 

PURUŞOTTAMATIRTHA (JAGANNATHA) 

Much has been written about Purusottamatirtha or Jagan. nātha, both in Sanskrit and in English. The following works in English may be consulted by those who desire to make a thorough study of the sacred place; W, W. Hunter's 'Orissa' 

1571, Vide Elliott and Dowson's 'History of India as told by its own historians' vol. VII D. 184, where a passage from the "Ma-Asr i-Alamgirl' is trapslated to the effect that "Aurangzeb commanded the destruction of the Hindu temple at Mathurā known by the name of 'Debra Kesa Rais (which according to that work had been built at a cost of 33 lakhs of rupeesj sad soon that strodghold of falsehood was levelled with the ground and on Be same spot was laid the foundation of a vast mosque."69$

Purusottamatirtha 

Vol. I pp. 81–167, Rajendralal Mitra's 'Antiquities of Orissa' Tol I pp. 99–144, R. D Banerji's 'History of Orissa' (in two volumes, 1930), Gazetteer on Puri, vol. XX pp. 409-412, 

There are four most important tirthas in Orissa, viz. Bhuvaneśvara (or Cakratītha), Jagannātha (or Saṅkha-ksetra), Konarka (or Padma-ksetra), Yajpura or Jajpur (Gadaksetra). The first two are still held in high esteem, while the last two are altogether neglected. 

Among the Puranas, Purushottania-tirtha is extensively dealt with in the Brahma (chap. 41-70, about 1600 verses), in the Brhannāradiya (uttarardha chap. 52–61, 825 Terses). Among digests, the Tirtha-cintamani of Vācaspati that devotes nearly one-third of the work to Purusottama-tirtha (pp. 53– 175) and that quotes about 800 Verses from the Brahmapurāna on Purusottama, Raghunandana's Purusottama-tattya (which is brief and mostly based on the Brahmapurāna) and the Tirthaprakāśa (pp. 561-594) may be mentioned. It is worthy of note that the Kalpataru (composed about 1110-1120 A, D.) does not describe Purusottama-tīrtha in its Tirthakanda. though it speaks of a few little known tirthas like Lohārgala. Stutasyāmin and Kokāmukha. 

Raghunandana in his Purusottama-tattva quotes a verse1572 (which as printed is corrupt) from the Rgveda that from the context appears to be addressed to some evil spirit (alaltsmi) and means 'O evil spirit with a vioked looking chin (or that art difficult to be killed)! Have recourse to that far-off wood in the sea, that has no connection with human beings and go to distant lands with it'. Then he states that the Atharva Veda has a similar verse. Probably following Sāyapa's inter

This interpretation is natural and suits the context very well I could not trace the verse in the Atharvaveda

[Vol. pretation, Raghunandana conneots this Rgveda verse with Purusottama, the image of which is made of wood, 

It would be proper to set out as briefly as possible the story of Jagannatha contained in the Brahmapurana. In Bharatavarsa there is a country called Ondra situated on the shores of the southern ocean, which extends northwards from the sea up to Viraja-mandala 1873 (chap. 28. 1-2). In that country there is a holy place, destroyer of sins and bestower of mukti, surrounded on all sides by sand and ten yojanas in extent (chap. 42. 13-14). There is the famous shrine of Puruso ttama in the country of Utkala the whole of which is very holy owing to the favour of the all-pervading Jagannātha (chap. 42. 35-37). Men who reside in Utkala are blessed like gods since Purusottama resides there. Chapters 43 and 44 narrate the story of Indradyumna who ruled at Avanti (Ujjayini) in Malaya (modern Mālvā). He was a very pious, lebrned and good king who after reading all Vedas, śāstras, epics, puranas and Dharmaśāstras came to the conclusion that Vasudeva was the highest Deity, started from his capital Ujjayini with a vast army, servants, priests and artisans and came to the shores of the southern 80a, saw the ksetra of Vasudeva, ten yojanas in breadth and five yojanas in length and encamped there, Formerly there was a Vata tree on the shores of the southern sea near which there was an image of Purusottama or 1974 Jagan. matha made of sapphire, which became embedded in sand and was concealed by creepers and plants. King Indradyumna per formed Aśyamedha there, erected a great temple (prāsāda) and was anxious to establish a suitable image of Vāgudeva in the temple. In a dream the king saw Vasudeva who told him to go alone to the shore in the morning and cut the Vata tree grow ing just on the water line with an axe, The king did go in the morning and then two brahmadab (who were really Viṣṇu and Visyakarmā) appeared, Vignu told the kaing that his associate (Viśyakarma) will manufacture the image. Three images of Kropa, Balarama and Subhadrā were made and given to the king and Vispu further conferred the boon that the pool called

Story of Indradyzimna 

695 

Indradyumna (where the king bathed at the end of his Aśra medha) will be known by the king's name, that whoever took a bath once in it would go to Indraloka, and that whoever offered pindas on the bank of the pool would save 21 ancestors of his family. Then the king established the three images in the temple built by him. 1575 The Skandapurana contains a Puruṣottamamāhātmya in a sub-section called Utkala-khanda in its section Vaisnava-khanda, where the story of Indra dyumna is given with some variations. 

Stripping this story of the supernatural, it appears probable that the holy place Purusottama was called Nilācala in very ancient times, that Krsna worship was introduced from Northern India at that place, and that three images of wood were established in comparatively early times. It may be stated here that in the Maitrāyani Upanisad 1576 an Indradyumna is named among a host of cakravartins. The Kūrmapurāna (II. 35, 27) makes a brief and colourless reference to Purusottama (tīrtbam Nārāyanasyāngat-Dāmanā tu Purusottamam). Rajendralal Mitra ('Antiquities of Orissa') surmises that there were three periods in the history of the Purusottama-ksetra, viz. early Hindu period, the Buddhist period and the Vaisdava period (after the 5th century A. D. when Buddhism began to wade). He notices that from about the 7th century A. D. consi derable temple records on palm leaves exist, but that the temple records for the Buddhist period are untrustworthy (p. 104) and that there are indications that Puri was probably a place of Buddhist sanctuary (p. 107). The indications of the existence 

1575. Vide Hooter's Onssa vol. I, pp. 89-94 for a somewhat differ. ent account based on Kapılasambitā, the most important poiats of which are that Visgu shows to Iodradyomna as His image a log of wood thrown up by the ocean, that the images were being fashioned by the divine carpenter, that it was ordered that no one was to see them till they were ready and that in spite of this, the queen insisted on seeing them when they had been' chiselled only up to the waist and when only stems stood in the place of the arms for the images of Krsna and Balarama, while the image of Subbadrā had no arms at all. The present images are to this day in the same condi tion. The images are described by Rajendralal Mitra 1a 'Antiquities of Orissa' II. pp 122–123. The story of the occurs in CT4911°, 3A 52 41-93, 53-57, 58, 1-21, 60-61, et agrees very closely with the.

[Vol. of Buddhism in Oriasa are the existence of Asoka's rock ediots on the Dhauli Hill (O.I.I. vol. I pp. 84–100), the existence of many caves of the Buddhist period on the Ihandagiri range about five miles to the west of Bhuvanesyara, the procession of the car of Jagannatha which resembles the procession of Buddha's Tooth relic as described by Fa Hien (Hunter's Orissa, Vol. I. p. 131-132) and the three cruda wooden images of Krspa, Subhadra and Balarama which are hardly found anywhere else and which correspond to the tāres peculiarities of Buddhism viz, Buddha, Dharma and Sapgha. Vide Mitra'a 'Antiquities of Orissa, vol. II. pp. 122-126 (where he gives wood-cuts showing the figures of the images and comparing them with Buddhist symbols and Cunningham's 'Ancient Goography of India' pp. 510-511 (the remarks in which appear to me far-fetched). In J. R. A, S. vol. 18 at p. 402 (new series) Sewell things that the celebrated image of Jagannatha was originally one of the Triśūlas or developed Taurus symbols. 

At present the sacred enclogure of Jagannātha is a square surrounded by a massive stone wall 20 feet high, 652 foot long and 630 feet broad with 120 temples containing various forms of God, 13 being temples of Siva, some more of Parvati and a temple of the Sun, This clearly shows the catholi city of Jagannatha, Almost every form of Hindu faith is represented here. Even the Brahmapurāna gives expression to this tolerant view when it says that the holy Purusottama ksetra forbids all the wranglings between Saives and the devotees of Viṣṇu, 1976a The great Pagoda of Jagannātha bas four chambers, the first being the Hall of Offerings (bhoga mandira ), the 2nd the pillared hall for music and dance (the nata mandira), the third the audience hall where pilgrims, asserable (the Jaganmohana mandıra) and the 4th the inner sanctuary.

Temple of Jagannatha 

697 

temple is situated at the distance of about seven furlongs from the sea shore and stands on a mound about 20 feet above the level of the surrounding ground, the mound being dignified by being called Nīlagiri (the blue hill ). There is a large gate-way on each side of the enclosure, that on the east being the most magnificent On each side of the entrance there is a colossal crouching lion and hence the door-way is called simha-dvāra (lion gate ). 

There are certain peculiar features of the great shrine of Jagannātha In the first place, in the court of Jagannātha and outside the Lion Gate no distinction of caste 1578 is observed Jagannatha is the god of all people. The second special feature is that the holy rice cooked as offering to Jagannātha is regard ed as so sanctified that all barriers of caste are transcended, so much so that a Parī priest will receive the holy food even from 

a low caste Hindu. The feeling is that cooked rice when once placed before Jagannātha never ceases to be pure. Hence the Wahāprasāda is dried, is taken to all parts of India and at the periodical śrāddhas among Vaisnavas a grain of this holy rice is invariably put on the cake as the most sacred article that can be offered to the Manes (vide Mitra's 'Antiquities of Orissa', vol. I 199). The third special feature of Jagannatha is the car festival (rathayātrā) which is the most important of the 24 high 1578festivals at Puri. The festival is described at length by Hunter in his 'Orissa', vol I pp. 131-134. The car festival starts on the 2nd day of the bright half of Āṣādha. The car of Jagannatha is about 45 feet in height, 35 feet square and is supported on 16 wheels of 7 feet diameter with 16 spokes and has Garuda as a crest; the 2nd car is that of Subhadrā, which is a little smaller than Jagannātha's car, resting on 12 wheels with 12 spokes in each and having a padma (lotus) as a crest, the 3rd car is that of Balarama resting on 14 wheels with 14 spokes in each wheel and has Hanūmān for crest. The cars are drawn by pilgrims and hired labourers from the temple to 

1578 Hunter 18 Orissa' (vol. I. pp 135-136) notes that only 21 classes and castes (including Christians and Mabomedans) are excluded, they being mostly flesb-eating and animal-life destroying castes Even the washerman and the potter whom Hunter includes in the list are allowed to enter the outer court.

(Vol. the country-house of Jagannātha (which is about two miles Away) amidst the shouts and emotional songs of thousands of pilgrims, Owing to the references in English literature to the cor of Jagannatha it is supposed by many that pilgrims used to throw themsolves before the car in a religious frenzy and were killed. But there is hardly any truth in these suppositions. Thoro might have been a fer accidental deaths. Hunter in Orissa' (vo). I pp. 133-34) scouts this idea of suicide under the car and Rajendralal observes (in 'Antiquities of Orissa', vol. II. p99) No Indian divinity bas & mors unenviable notorioty in English Literature than Jagannatha. It is certaio, neverthe loss, that human conception has never realized a more innocent and gentle divinity than Jagannatha and the tenets of his votaries are the very reverse of sanguinary or revolting. Never was opprobrino more unjustly cast on an inoffensive object than in this instanoe and none merited it less'. On the 10th day of the bright helf begins the return of the car from the country house, 

According to Rajendralel Mitra the oldest temple in Puri is that of Ajabukeśvara built by Lalatondu Kesari (629-677 A. D.), the builder of the tower of Bhuvanesvara; the next oldest is Mārkandeśvara and next comes the great temple of Jagannatha (vol. II. p. 112). Manmohan Chakravarti in his paper on the date of Jaganpāthe temple in Puri' (J. A.

As Codaganga's coronation took place in sake 999 (i 6. 1078 A, D.) according to M. M. Chakravarti, he put forward the view that the prāsāda of Jagannātha was built about 1085-1090 A. D. Dr. D. C, Sirkar (in "God Purusottama at Puri' J. O, R., Madras vol. 17 pp.: 209-215) points out that the celebrated Oriya Chronicle Mādalā-pāñjā attributes the construction of Purusottama Jagannātha not to Codaganga but to his great grandson -Ananga-bhima III, who also installed an image of Purusottama in a temple at Vārāpasi-Kataka (modern Cuttack)

which was desecrated by Sultan Firuz Shah ( vide Elliot and Dowson's 'History of India', vol II. pp 312-315). These Ganga kings built magnificent temples at Bhuvaneśvara (ancient Ekāmra), Konārka and Purī, which are the finest surviving speci mens of North Indian Hindu Architecture. Mitra ('Antiquities of Orissa 'yol I. pp. 109-110 ) and Hunter (Orissa' vol. I pp. 100-102 ) note that Ananga-bhīma wanted to eclipse the grand tower of Bhuvanesvara and renovated the temple of Jagannatha in śake 1119 (i. e. 1198 A D ). 1580 

The temple of Jagannātha has an arnıy of attendants They are divided into 36 orders and 97 classes. At the head was the Raja of Khurdha who called himself the 'sweeper of Jagannatha'(vide Hunter's 'Orissa', vol I p 128 ). 

As in Banaras, so here also there are five important tirthas, 1531 viz. the pool of Mārkandeya, the Vata tree (identi fied with Krsoa), Balarama, the sea and Indradyumna pool A few words may be said here about each. The story of Mārkandeya is narrated in Brahmapurāda, chapters 52-56 and in Nrsimha-purāna 10.21 ff (briefly ). In chap. 56. 72-73 Viṣṇu asks Mārkandeya to build a temple of Siva to the north of Jagannātha and to construct a sacred pool which thence forward was to become known as “Mārkandeya's pool'. The Brahmapurāna provides that the pilgrim should bathe in Mārkandega's pool, dip his head thrice, utter a mantra (chap, 57. 3-4), then he should perform tarpana, go to the temple of Siva (called Mārkandeyeśvara ) and worship him with the Mūlamantra 1582 viz. 'Om namah Sivāya', then with another mantra called Aghora and a Paurāpic mantra, The pilgrim should, after a bath in Mārkandeya's pool and visit to the temple of Siva, repair to the sacred Vata, circum-ambulate it

It may be noted that the Brahmapurāna 157 17 expressly states that the Vata is Vispu Himself in that form (Dygrodhakrtikam Vispum pradipatya ). The Vata is also styled Kalpayrksa (Brahma 57. 12, 60,18). The pilgrim should boy to Garuda standing in front of Krspa and then worship Krsda, Saṅkarsada and Subhadrā with mantras. The mantras for Saṅkarsada are verses 22-23 of Brahmapurāna chap. 57 and that for Subhadrā is chap. 57. 58 1584 The mantra to be used in the worship of Krsna is either of 12 syllables (om namo bhagavate Vāgudevāya) or of eight syllables (om namo Nārāyapāya). Brahmapurāna chap. 577 verses 42-51 specify the various rewards of seeing Krsna with devotion and wind up by promising moksa 1585 A bath in the sea at Pari is always commendable, but particularly on the Hull Moon day (Brahma 60. 10). Brahma chap. 6% deals at length with the bath in the sea (the whole of it except one verse being quoted by Tir. C. pp. 126-128). The Indra dyumna pool has been mentioned above (pp. 694-95). The pilgrim has to bathe in the Indradyumna pool, perform tarpana for gods, sages and piirs and offer pindas to his ancestors (chap 63. 2-5). 

In the Govindapur stone Inscription of the poet Gangadhara (E. I Vol. II. p. 330 ) of sahe 1059 1 e. (1137-38 A. D.) there is a clear reference to Purusottama 158 

The Brahmapurana chap 6G speaks of the Gundicāyātra for seven days on the bank of the Indradyumna pool in a maṇḍapa where reside (temporarily ) Krsna, Saṅkarsana and Subhadra. The Tir. O. which quotes the whole of that chaptor (pp. 157-159 ), calls it Gundikā, while in the drama Caitanya

candrodaya 1587 it is styled Gundicā at the very beginning. It appears that Gundicā is the summer house of Jagannātha about two miles from the great Temple, The word is probably derived from gunds, which means a thick log of wood in Bengali and Uriya {vide Mitra's 'Antiquities of Orissa', vol. II. pp. 138-139) and has reference to the legend of a log of wood that Indradyumna found floating in the sea. 

It may be noted that religious suicide at Purusottama is referred to in Brahmapurāda: 1588 those who give up their body (life) in Purusottama-ksetra after mounting up the Vata tree or do so between the Vata and the ocean reach without doubt moksa. A man abandoning life, either intentionally or unintentionally, either on his way to Purusottama or in the cemetery or in the country house (of Jagannātha ) or in the streets (of Jagannātha ) or even anywhere else there secures moksa. Therefore men desiring moksa should by all means give up life at that holy place'. 

The Brahmapurāna winds up by saying it is thrice 1569 true that that ksetra (Purusottama) is the greatest and highest

The great Vaisnaya saint, Caitabya, settled permanently at Puri in 1515 A, D. at the age of thirty and spent eighteen years there till 1533 (when he died). He appears to have made a great impression on the Gajapati kipg Prataparudra deva, ruler of Orissa (1497-1540 A, D.). In the drama Caitanya candrodaya of Kavikarnapūra the king is shown to be so anxious for meeting the saint that he declares that he would die if the gracious glance of the saint did not fall on him.1990 This should be attributed to the inveterate habit of gross exaggera tion rampant in most Sanskrit writers, particularly ainongst devotees and followers of great saints, Caitanya came to be worshipped along with Visou as a deity in Pari and Orissa (vido Hunter's 'Orissa' vol. I. p. 109). Kavikarpapūra in his drams (8th Act) makes Sārvabhauma say that there is no distinction between God Jagannātha and Caitanya, the only difference being that Jagannatha is 'dārubrahma' (Godhead manifested in a wooden image) and Caitanya is 'narabrahma' (Godhead in human form ). 1591 The Caitanyacaritāmrta (a poem) of Kavikarpapūra in cantos 14-18 deals with the devotional and ecstatic life of Caitanya at Puri and presents & vivid picture of Ratha and other festivals of Jagannatha in which Caitanya took a prominent part, I agree with Dr. S. K. De that there is no satisfactory evidence to show that Pratānarudra was actually converted into the new faith (Vaisnava faith and movemont in Bengal' p. 67). 

One regrettable feature of the great temple of Jagannatha is the existence of some obscene and lascivious sculptures that disfigure the walls of the temple and the presence of dancing girls with rolling ayos, to which pointed reference is made by all writers, particularly European ones (vide, for example, Indian Antiquary vol. I. p. 32%, Hunter's 'Orissa', vol. I pp. 111, 135). The presence of dancing girls is a legacy from tho past.

NARMADA 

Next to the Ganges the most sacred rivers of India are the Narmada and the Godāvarī. A few words about each of these may be said here, 

An express reference to the Narmadā has not so far been traced in the Vedic Literature. The Satapatha Br. (XII 9 3.1) refers to one Revottaras who was a Dātava Cakra and sthapati (a chief) and whom the Srõjayas expelled (SBE TO). 44 p. 269) 1893, Ravā is apother name for Narmadā 1594 and it is possible to say that Revottaras was named after Revā A. vārtika on Dān. IV. 2. 87 derives the word Mahismat (as the name of a country) from "Mahisa'. This is generally identified with Māhismati (on the Narmada). So the name Narmada was probably known to the author of the Vārtikas (about the middle of the 4th century B. C) The Raghuvamsa VI. 43 speaks of Māhismati as the capital of Anūpa on the bank of the Revā (i e. Narmadā). 

The Narmadā is frequently mentioned in the Mahābhārata and some of the Purāṇas. The Matsya (chapters 186–194, 554 Verses), Kūrma (Uttarārdha, chapters 40-42 verses 189), Padma Ādıkhanda (chap 13-23,739 verses, most of which are the same as in the Matsya) deal with greatness of Narmadā and the tirthas thereon 1594. The Matsya (194, 45) and Padma (Adi khaoda 21. 44) state that from the place where the Narmada falls into the sea up to the Amara-kantaka mountain (where it rises) there are ten crores of sacred places, while the Agni purāpa (113. 2) and Kūrma II, 40. 13 raise the number to 60 crores and 60 thousand The Nāradiya ( uttarardha chap 77)

1594 a It may be noted that the earliest extant digest, viz Kalpataru od tirthas (pp. 198–205) quotes verses only from the Matsyapurāṇa, chapter 186-189 (19 all aboot 70 verses on Narmada) and from no other source. 

704 



(Vol. says (verse 1) that there are 400 principal tirthas on both banks of the Narmada, but from Amara-kantaka three crores and a half (verses 4 and 27-28). 1595 The Vanaparva (in chap 188 103 and chap. 222.24) mentions the Narmadā along with the Goda vari and other rivers of the south. In the same parra (chap. 89. 1-3) it is stated that the holy Narmada is in the Ānarta country 15%, that it is endowed with priyangu creepers and mango groves, that it has strings of Vānira fruit, that it flows to the west and that all the holy places in the three worlds come for a bath to the Narmadā. The Matsya and Padma declare 1597 that the Ganges is holy in Kanakhala, the Saras vati jn Kuruksetra, but the Narmadā is holy everywhere whether in a village or in a forest and that the Narmadā purifies the sinner by its very sight while the waters of the Sarasvati do so by three baths (on three days), of the Yamunā (by baths) in seven days and of the Ganges by a single bath. The Vianu dharmasūtra (85.8) in enumerating a list of tirthas that are eminently fit for śrāddha includes the banks of the Narmadā throughout the whole length among them. The Narmada is said 1598 to have started from the body of Rudra which is a poe tic way of saying that it rises from Amarakantaka that is said to be the abode of God Maheśvara and his spouse (Matsya 188 91). The Vāyupurāna declares that the holy Narmadā, the best of rivers, is the daughter of the pitis and the śrāddhas offered on it become inexhaustible 1599. The Matsya and Kūrma both say

Though ter and THET are generally used as synonyms it is found that the w ayrut 1a V 19 18 coumcrates them separately (anyt tar INI THET) and the guv (13,25 and 29-30) states that thc Hava springs from Frey and ET from 197€ HTUT una terre ATYTI FER Eurat TETET ata Fiat Freio (5) 77,27-28, vido Dote 1268 above for similar eulogy of the Ganges. 

1596 Ābarta appears to be the ancient name of Gujarat and Kathawar together. In the Udyogaparva Dvārakā is called Agarta-nagari (7.6) As Narmada is said to lay through Ānarta it must be supposed that in the times of the Great Epic Quarta iacloded both sonthera Gujarat and Kathiawar,

that the river Narmadā has a course of complete 100 yojanas and its breadth is two yojanas 1660. Prof. K, V. Rangaswami Aiyangar seizes upon the length of 100 yojanas and says (on p. 199 note 4 of his edition of Kalpataru on Tirtha in G. O, S.) that the Matsya is very accurate, since the length of the Narmada is now found to be about 800 miles. But he forgets that the breadth is said to be two yojanas (i.e. 16 miles on the scale for a yojana adopted by him). It is not shown how and where (except at the mouth if at all) the Narmadā is 16 miles in breadth in its long course. Both Matsya and Kūrma state that the Narmada is (rises) from Amarakantaka which is to the western side of the country of Kalinga 1601 

The Viṣṇupurāna provides that if a man repeats day and night and whenever he has to go inside a dark place the mantra 'Salutation to Narmada in the morning I salutation to Narmadā at night! O Narmadā) salutation to you; save me from poisonous serpents' 1602 he has no danger from serpents. 

It is stated in the Kūrma and the Matsya that a man who commits suicide by entering fire or water or by fasting (on some of the tīrthas on the Narmadā or on Amarakantaka) does not return (to this samsāra).1603 

The Narmada is mentioned as Namados by Ptolemy (p. 102). One of the earliest inscriptional references to it occurs in the Eran stone pillar Inscription of Budhagupta in 165 of Gupta era i. e. 484-85 A, D, Vide C. I. I. yo). I, at p. 89. 

Several rivers are mentioned as falling into the Narmada such as Kapila (on the south bank, Matsya 186. 40, Padma I, 13. 35), Vīśalyā (Matsya 186. 46 = Padma 1, 13, 35-39), Erandi (Matsya 191, 42-43, Padma I. 18. 44), Iksu-nādi (Matsya 191. 49, Padma I. 18.47), Kaveri (Matsya 189. 12-13,1604 Padma I 16.6).

[Voli Many sub-tirthas are enumerated, out of which two or three may bo nientioned here. One is Maheśvara-tirtha (1. e. Omkāra) from where Rudra is said to have burnt down with an arrow the three cities of Bānāsura (Matsya 188,2 ft, Padina I 15 2 ff), Sukla-tirtha (highly praised in Matsya 192.3 ff about which it is said that the rājars Cāpakya 1605 attained perfection there), Bhrgutirtha (at the very 1608 sight of which a man becomes free from six, a bath in which leads to heaven and death at which ensures non-return to sainsara ), the Jamadagnya-tirtha (where the Narmada 1607 falls into the sea and where Lord Japārdana secured perfection). The mountain Amarakantaka is a tīrtha that dispels all sins including brahmana-murder and it is one yojana all round in extent (Matsya 189. 89, 98). The most important place on the Narmadā is, however, Māhismati, about the exact location of which scholars have differed. The general consensus of opinion is that Mābismati is to be identified with Omkāra Mandhata, an island in the Narmadā about 40 miles south of Indore. It has a long history. Moggaliputta Tissa is said in Buddhist works to have sent missionaries to several countries in the reign of Asoka (about 247 B O.), one of which was sent to Mahigamandala. Dr. Fleet in his paper · Mabisa. mandala and Māhismati' (in J, R. A. S. for 1910 pp. 425-417) assigns cogent reasons for identifying Mahigamapdala and Māhismati. Māhismati was well-known to the Mahābhasya, 188 from a passage in which it follows that by a forced march & person starting from Ujjayini could reach Māhismati the next morning. Kādidāsa describes it as surrounded by Revā (Raghuvamśa VI 43). Mākiemati is mentioned as being on

GODĀVARĪ 

No mention of Godāvari has so far been found in the Vedic Literature. In Buddhist works there are traditions about Bavari, who was & purohita of Mahākosala and then of Pasenadi, who resided in Assaka's territory in the vicinity of Alaka on the Godavari and who is said to have sent several disciples to Buddha at Srāvasti (vide Suttanipāta, S. B, E, vol. X part 2 pp. 184 and 187). The Vārtika 'Saṅkhyāyā nadī-godāyari bhyām ca' on Pān. V, 475, expressly mentions Godavari and has in view 'Saptagodāvara'. The two Epics and Purāṇas contain numerous references to it. The Vanaparya 1609 mentions it as a holy river in the south, abounding in gardens and full of water and resorted to by hermits performing austerities. The Aradyakanda of the Rāmāyana (13.13 and 21) speaks of the country well-known as 'Pancavati' frequented by herds of deer which is near the Godavari and about two yojanas from Agas tya's hermitage. It is in the Brahmapurāna that the Godāvarī and the subsidiary tirthas on it have been lauded at great length in chapters 70–175, The Tirthasāra (a part of Nrsimha prasāda ) quotes about 60 verses from chapters 89, 91, 106, 107, 116-118, 121, 122, 128, 131, 144, 154, 159, 172 of the Brahma pusāda, which fact shows that the chapters on Gautami in the present Brahmapurāna, were part of the Brahmapurāna at least some centuries before 1500 AD. Vide my paper in J.B.B.R.A.S for 1917 p 27-28. The Brahmapurāna generally refers to the Godāvari as Gautami, 1610 It is stated by the Brahmapurāna that the Ganges to the south of the Vindhya mountain is called Gautami and to its north Bhāgirathi, The Godā vari is said to be 200 yojanas long and there are three crores and a half of

[Vol, tirthas on it, 1611 Dandakāranya is said to be the seed (source or cause) of dharma and multi and the country embraced by the Gautami is specially the holiest 1612 A verse ocourring in several purānas states "These countries (of Madhyadeśa) are immediately next to the mountain Sahya: thereon is Godavarī and that country is the most charming in the whole world, There is Govardhana there which is (like) Mandara and Gandhamadana'. 1613 Brahmapurana (chapters 74-76) narrates how Gautama brought the Ganges from the matted hair of Siva to Brahmagiri where he had his hermitage and how Ganesa helped in the task by means of a ruise. The Nāradapurana (uttarārdha 72) narrates that no rain fell for 12 years while Gautama practised tapas, that owing to famine all sages came to Gautama's hermitage, that he brought Gangā to his hermi. tage, that he sowed śāli grains in the morning and reaped the crop by midday, that this went on till there was plenty of rain and crops, that Siva appeared to him, that Gautama prayed that Siva should stay near his hermitage and that hence the hill on which Gautama had bis hermitage came to be called Tryambaka (verge 24). Varāha (71. 37-44) also says that Gautama brought Jābpayi to Dandaka and the river became Godāvari, The Kūrma (II. 20. 29-35) mentions a long list of rivers and other sacred places and winds up by saying that the Godāvari is pre-eminently & place for performing śrāddha. It is stated in the Brahmapurāna that for the removal of all kinds of distress two alone are declared (as the means) viz. the holy river Gautami or Siva who is full of compassion, 1614 The Brabmapurana describes about a hundred tirthas on the Godavari, such as Tryambaka (79.6), Kuśāvarta (80, 1-3), Janasthāna ( 88. 1), Govardhana (chap. 91), Pravarāsangama

Nasik must have existed at least 200 years before Christ. An Inscription on one pillar of the railing at Bharbut stupa (about 200 B.C.) records the gift of Goraksitā of Nasik, the wife of Vasuka, 1616 This is the earliest certain historical reference to Nasik discovered so far. The Mahābhāṣya 1617 speaks of Nasikya as a city. The Vāyu purāna (45.130) mentions Nāsikya as a country. The Nasik Inscriptions in the Papąulenā capes (Bombay Gazetteer Vol. 16 pp. 544-639 and E. I vol. VII pp. 59-96 edited by Senart) establish that Nasik was a prosperous place in the centuries before and after Christ. Ptolemy (about 150 A, D.) mentions Nasika (Ptolemy p. 156). It is not possible for rea sons of space to go into the detailed history of Nasik, its bath ing places and pools, its temples, pilgrimages and rites of vorship. For these one may consult the Bombay Gazetteer, vol. 16 (for Nasik District). That volume states that there are about 60 temples in Nasik (pp. 503-512) and 16 in Pancavati and one the left bank of the Godāvarī (pp. 512 ff). But hardly any really old temple has survived. In 1680 A. D. twenty-five temples at Nasik vere destroyed by the Decoan Viceroy of Aurangzeb Almost all the large temples that adorn Nasik were built during the tinies of the Peshwas of Poona (1750 1818). Three temples are specially vorthy of mention, viz, the the Rāmji temple in Pancavati and Nāro Shankar's temple (or Bell temple) on the left bank of the Godavari near the first crossing and that of Sundar&-Dārāyana in Aditwar Petk at Nasik (p. 503).

Jupiter is in Leo for one year once in twelve years. Crowds of pilgrims throng at Nasık in their thousands from all parts of India in the simhastha year, 

KANCI (modern Conjeeveram). Kāñci is one of the seven holy cities of India (vide p. 678 n. 1535 above) and one of the most ancient towns in southern India If we rely on the tradition recorded by Hiouen Thsang who stayed in Kāñci about 640 A. D. it would follow that Buddha frequented the region around Kañcīpura and that Kāñcī had a stripa about 100 feet high built by Aśokarāja (Beal's B. R. W, W. vol. I. p. 230 ). Hiouen Thsang informs us that Kāñci was 30 lt (or about 53 miles) in circuit, that in his day there vere eighty Deva temples and that there were many heretics called Nirgranthas (Beal's B. R. W. W. vol. II. pp. 228-229 ). The next important daturn is the mention of Kāāci-puraka (resident of Kancīpura) in the Mahābhāṣya on Vārtika 26 to Pan, IV. % 104 (Kielhorn, vol II. p. 298 ). Several early records relating to the ancient history of the Pallavas of Kāñci (of about 250 to 350 A. D.) have been published, such as the Mayidayolu plates of Yuyamahārāja Siya-skandavarman (E. I. vol. VI p. 84), the Hirahadagalli Inscription of the 8th year (E. I vol. 1. p. 2), and the Talgunda Pillar Inscription of Kadamba Kākusthavarman (E. I vol. VIII p. 24). The

History of Dirarmaśāstra 

Allahabad Prasasti of Samudragupta (Gupta Inscriptions ed, by Tleet p.7) states that Samudragupta vanquished Viṣṇugopa, king of Kanoi (Kāūceyaka), in the first half of the 4th century AD. In the 'Manimekhalai' there is an elaborate description of the town of Kāñci where Manimekhalai ultimately attained to enlightenment (vide S, Krishnaswani Aiyangar's "Mani mekhalai in its historical setting' p. 20). It is not necessary for the present purpose to refer to the numerous inscriptions about the Pallavas and Kāñci and the large number of papers contributed to learned Journals. Reference may, however, be made to the careful and scholarly work 'History of the Pallavas of Kāñci' by R. Gopalan (1928), which brings together all rolevant data published up to the date of its composition, 

Let us now turn to some passages from the Purāṇas about Kāñci. The Brahmānda agsertg. 1623 The two cities of Kāśı aod Kāñct are the two eyes of Lord Siva; Kanel is a famous Vaisnava hsetra but it also brings about the presence of Siva'. It is stated in the Bārhagpatya-sūtra (III. 124) that Kāñoi 18 a Sākta-ksetra and in the Devibhagayata (VIL 38, 8) it is said to be a Devisthana called Annapurna. The Vamana-purāna 1614 observes: the Jāti is the best among flowers, Kāñcf the best among towns, Rambha among women, the householder among persons of (the four) aśramas, Kuśasthali is the best among cities and Madhyadeśa among all countries, 

Kāñcī is full of temples and shrines. The most famous are the Vaikuntha Perumal temple of Viṣṇu and the Saiya temple of Kailāganātha built by Pallava Rājasimba. This latter has a large hal supposed to contain 1000 coluinps,2625 There is an old Jaina temple also.

On the materials so far available it is difficult to decide when the shrine of Vithoba was established, but there is sufficient evidence to enable one to say that it was certainly in existence in the middle of the thirteenth century A. D.1626 The Padmapurāna (Uttara-khanda 176, 56-58) mentions the image of Vitthala Vispu on the bank of the Bhimarathi which has only two arms and is called Bindu-madhara. The difficulty is about the date of this part of the Padmapurāna. In my opinion it is a late addition and cannot be placed earlier than about 1000 A. D. The modern town of Pandharpur lies along the right bank of the Bhimā river. The chief temple in Pandharpur is that of Vithobā in the centre of that part of the town which is considered holy. The Bombay Gazetteer vol. 20 describes at some length (pp. 417-424) the main temple of Vithoba and its adjoining parts. Behind the temple of Vithobā is the temple of Rakhumal, the consort of Vithobā. There is a large staff of priests and attendants in the temple of Vithobā, the chief of whom are those called Badges (who are the most numerous body of the staff and who once claimed to be owners of the temple, but who are now held to be the trustees and guardians of the temple pro perty and of the god's jewels under a scheme of management framed by the High Court of Bombay),1627 Except the Badyes all

other attendants are called sevādhāris and they are of various grades, vix, the pujāris ( who take the principal part in the worship of the God), Benarıs 1628 (who repeat mantras and hymns at different services), paricāralas (who bring in a large silver disl the water with which the pujāri washes the image of the God and brings the lamp for waving it before the image at the evening and night services), haridus (who sings generally five Verses in honour of the god at the morning, evening and night services), the dingres (who hold a mirror before the God at the early morning service after the god has been dressed and before the lights are waved), the diutés (the torch-bearers) who hold a lighted torch when the last night ceremonies are over and carry the slippers of the god in torch-light processions three times a year on the Full Moon days of Asādha and Kārtika and on the Drsū night), the dange (who stands with a silver or gold plated mace outside the ants-chamber at the morning, evening and night services). The goddess Rakhumāi has only one set of priests known as Utpāls, of whom there are over a hundred families, 

The Bombay Gazetteer describes at length (pp. 427-430) the ordinary and special services in the temple of Vithoba which are passed over here. Their essence is that the god is treated as if he were some high human person requiring bath, dress, songs, sleep against fatigue and so on. One thing, hov ever, may be noticed that no women singers or dancers are connected with this temple of Vithobā in contradistinction to many temples in the Decoan and South India, 

The image of Vitthal or Vithoba in the temple is about three feet and nine inches high and together with its base seems to be cut out of one block of trap. Its rough appearance is probably due to the effect of time. The image is standing with its arms alambo and hands resting on the hips; the left hand holds a conch and the right a cakra (discus). On the image are carved but 80 slightly as to be hardly noticeable except on close examination a waist cloth and round the waist a waist-band the end of which hangs on the right thigh. The ornaments con sist of a necklace and in the long ears are ear-rings which touch the shoulders. On the head is a long round-topped cap. Mr.

Vithobā Image at Pandharpur 

715 

Kantak, the rriter of the pote on Pandharpur in the Bombay Gazetteer vol. 20, remarks (p. 424): “The dress and ornament of the image belong to a (time) little later than the Guptas, probably not later than the 5th or 6th century after Christ. As far as is known no other existing Vaisnava temple in India has an image of Vispu like the Pandharpur image, but there are two similar images of the third century after Christ in the Udayagiri brahmanical caves Dear Bhisā. .... . Like the Pan- . dharpur image these are both standing figures with arms akimbo and hands resting on the hips and a conch and discus in the hands". Formerly pilgrims used to embrace the image and also touched the feet of the image. But since about 1873 the feet alone are allowed to be touched. 

The Bombay Gazetteer (vol. 20 r. 431, note 2) states that the image of Vithoba was removed to various places at diffe rent times to save it from sacrilege by fanatic Moslem invaders and rulers. About 500 yards east of Fitkoba's temple in the bed of the Bhimā river is the temple of Pundlik, one of the most favourite places of worship in Pandharpur, This last temple is not that of a god. It only marks the spot where Pundlik, a great devotee of Vitthal, spent his last days and died. Pundlik was probably a brāhmada fronu Pandharpur, originally an undutiful son who ill-treated his parents, but who later repented on seeing the dutifu] cobbler Rohidās, changed his ways and became a very dutiful son, so much so that tradition says that god Vithobā came to visit him. Vithobā apd Pundlik have become so much coupled together that all pilgrims before beginning to dine and on other occasions shout the cry *Pundalika parade Hari Vitthal' 1629, The Bom. G. rol 20 (pp. 432-134) describes the temple of Pundlik and narrates the traditional story about him 

1629. The uniter ia Bom G. vol 20 translates the words yes t e e Form as 'O' Pundalika, grant os e boon, Hari Vitbal”. This trapslation does sot appear to me to be correct. The cry is also in the form 'goditi PIETER SE {sbich is the correct one) In my opinion Fam is only a vocative and the correct form is qui tet (for est) and the whole cry means 'O Hari Vitlial? that didst grant a boon to Pondalla'.

Yol, 20 describe the sereral temples and shrines at Pandharpur such as those of Viṣṇupado, Trimbakeśvara, Candrabhāgā, Janabai's cell, which are all passed over here. The river Bhīmā is styled Candrabhāgā within Pandharpur limits and its water is believed to possess sin-purifying power. 

Several important and controversial questions arise in relation to Vithobā's temple at Pandharpur; vix, the date whon the image of Vithobā was installed in the temple at Pandharpur, whether the present image is an old one or & substitute, what the ancient name of Pandharpur was, the derivation of tho word 'Vitthal'As regards the first question it may be stated that there is not enough evidence to establish with certainty the time when the image was established 1630 But some of the items of evidence may be briefly set out here. In I A. vol, 14 Pp. 68-75 Prof. K. B. Pathak published an inscription on a coppor plate found at Bendigere (about eleven miles south-east from Belgaum), the inscription being dated in śale 1171 (1249 A.D), in which Pandharpur is called Paundarikaksetra on the Blinna rathi (at p. 74) and Vithoba is called Vigpu and which records the grant of a village in Venugrāna district (Belgaum) to number of brāhmadas by a minister of Yadava king Krsno (or Kaphara in the inscription) in the presence of god Viṣṇu (n. 74) i. e. before the image of Vispu or Vitthala. Dr. R, G Bhandarkar in. 'Vaisnavism, Saivism &c, (p. 88) and in 'History of the Deccan' (2nd ed. p. 115-6) refers to an inscription on stone dated sake 119% (1270 A, D.) in Pandharpur itself, in which Bhanu, son of Kosava, is represented as having performed the Aptoryāma sacrifice in Pandurangapura 'on account of which crowds and Vitthala were greatly pleased. There is another earlier inscription in the temple of Vithobā on three sides of a stone beam in a sopā beyond the maṇḍapa (porch) of 16 millars, - the script being Devanagari and the language being partis Sanskrit and partly Canarese. It was issued in sale 1159 (1237 S.

made the heart of sage (muna) Pundarika expand (with devotion). Vide Bom. G. vol.' 20 pp. 419-420 and pp. 4-6 of Mr Khare's monograph' (on medieval references). The Mysore Archaeo logical Survey Report for 1929 (pp. 197--210) publishes a copper plate inscription issued by the Rāstrakūta king Avidheya which records a grant of Pāndaranga-palli and four other villages situated to the east of Mabādeva hill to a brābmada named Jayad-vittha. This grant was confirmed about 820 A. D. by Rastrakuta king Sarvarasa (i. e. Amoghavarsa. I). The editor Dr. Krishna is of opinion that the date of the inscription must be 516 A D. (and. p 203). Therefore the important con clusion follows that Pandharpur was known to Canarese people as Pandarage and was also called Pandarangapalli. This in scription does not expressly refer to god Vitthala, but the donee's name Jayad-vittha contains the part Vittha which is most probably an early form of Vitthala. 

In a york called 'Vitthalabhūsana' 1631 by one Gopalācārya about eleven verses are quoted from Hemādri on Tirtha which are quoted below 1632. Briefly they state. an excellent tirtha ex

tVol ists on the southern bank of the river Bhaimi and there is also a rare but fine image there; it is called Paundarika ksetra and the greatest of gods viz. Panduranga worshipped by the whole ksetra resides there. It is three times holier than Puskara, six and ton times holier than Kedāra and Vārānasi respectively. Pundarīka practised severe austerities at the end of Drāparayuga in the 28th Kalpa and always devotedly attended upon his parents. God Krsna who was making a herd of cows graze on Govardhana hill became pleased with him for his devotion to his parents, Krsna who wields & stick for driving cows, who has bracelets rendered bright by (the colour) of the umbrella 1633 (shade), who is adorned with a head-gear (mukuta) and a skya ( a loop ) scintilating with the lustre of many jewels, who was very charming and had armlets studded with jewels, who does not appear to ) wear any dhots, but has his loins covered with nickers, who is set off by a girdle of three strings tied on his waist and who stands with arms akimbo and appears possessed of three lines on his belly. Though a ms. of the Tirtha portion of Hemādri's work has not yet been recovered, there is no reason to doubt that the verses were taken by Gopālācārya from Hemādri's work, particularly when almost all those verses are quoted by the T. S. (about 1500 A. D.) from the Skandapurāna and Kūrmapurāna. As Hemādri composed his work about 1260 to 1270 A. D. and as the verses quoted by him are cited from the Skandapurada, it follows that several centuries before 1260 A. D. Pandharpur was known as a tirtha, that the devotee and saint Pupdarika (Marathi 'Pupdlik') also was so known then and that the image of Vithoha was essentially the same in appearance as it is now. That Pandharpur had risen in sanctity and importance in the 15th century follows from the fact that both the great Vaispava saints, Caitanya and Vallabha, visited it Vide Prof. S. K. De's 'Vaisnava faith and movement in Bengal' p.71 for

Caitanya's visit and 'Sri Vallabhacharya' by Manilal C. Parekh (pp. 56-59 ) for Vallabhācārya's visit, 

It has been already shown from the Bombay Gazetteer that there is a tradition about the image having bgen removed several times and brought back. On pp. 16-25 of his work. Mr. Khare cites various passages from medieval writers in Sanskrit, Marathi and Canarese and comes to the conclusion that the present image is not only not the ancient one but that it was not there in the 17th century, since the characteristics of the present image do not tally with the description contained in the poems of saint Tukārām. I do not agree with his conclusions, He has overlooked several weighty considerations. He has relied upon inferences drawn from the presence of Afzulkhan and the bigoted emperor Aurangzeb in the Deccan. I have cited above (pp. 63%, 692) references to the demolition of North Indian temples and images on the orders of Aurangzeb, but Mr. Khare has been unable to show any direct reference to the demolition of the temple or the image of Vithoba on the orders of any Moslema king or officer,1634 We cannot rely on mere inferences or not properly authenticated letters or verses. Besides, the present image is so much worn that unless one yery carefully 

1634. It may, however, be stated that there is some evidence that efforts were made to demolish the temple of Vitboba by some Moslem Ling of Bidar and that the Badves ( the guardians of the Panchari temple ) fearing destruction of the image removed it and concealed it somewhere else. In a Narātbi work called HECTERETETTET EE, by Mr. Narayan Krishna Gadre (1905) p 168 verses are cited from a life (completed in sabe 1667 I e 1745 A D ) of one Chāngā Madhesa ( who died 12 śake 1427 i e 1505 A.D.) written by his descendant Shamji Gosāvi Vaõjarkhede (wbo was 11th in descent from Changa Mudhesa) The Marathi verses are; पदरीचा राजा वामणी पातशहा। ब्राह्मणासी यह छळियलें। हिंदधर्म जितुके तितके वर्जियेले। राज विध्वसिलें पढरीचे केलीसे मशीद महाद्वार मोडुन ! सातमास पूर्ण झाले यासी।

Therefore, there is great scope for diferences of opinion on the characteristic features of the present image. Conceding for argument that the tradition about the removal of the idol is we, that does not establish that the present image is djśerent from the one that existed in the 13th century or before. The present image has an elongat ed Lead dress Thica some may construe as a simple mukuta (Crowa) with a rim: but the pajāris and com.non people regard it as a Sirajižga and the rim as the rope of the śi? 10 that is carried on the back ( by conherds ) The present image has ear-rings (as Mr. Khare admits) but they are so long that the rest on the sooulders The prezent image has angadas (armlets) on the upper arms (and that is the description in the Skanda-purāna quoted by Herradri) The presens image has ornaments on the wrists (Thich the passage irom the Skandapurana also mentions). There is a girdle vrith three strings on the waist of the present image (in Se also se bate * trittenāpukālena kapibaddhena or bagibandheng rajitaḥ'). The present imaga 55 does not clearly show that a dhoti was torn (and therefors one reading of the Standa says that it is 'digtāsā) ') bar the Skazda adds that the image has arms akimbo. In my opinion the description in the Skanda parāba (which must be held to be at least zot later than about 1000 A.D.) tallies in essential particulars with the present image: tberefore it 201oys that suficient eridence has not been adduced to show that it is comparatives a bev image and the proposition of Mr. Share that it is a different one from the original should be held not proced.

0.2% Bailā sola hajāra' &c. ). But Tukarām į does mention the facts that the arms are akimbo, that there is no dhoti (digambara), and mentions the existence of a skya, a stick, also a girdle and ornaments. Lastly,, Mr. Khare does not attach sufficient importance to two facts, one being that about 1873 two Gosavis damaged the image which was later re-installed and pilgrims were forbidden from embracing it. It is quite possible that some of the features already indistinct were lost in these happenings (vide Bom, G. vol. 20 p.430). Besides, for hundreds of years the image has been washed with pazīcāmsta (will, curds, ghee, honey and sugar) and water at least once every day and sometimes several times a day. It is not difficult to imagine that the characteristic marks became blurred by these continual baths. 

Some other matters require to be dealt with. The image is variously called viz. Panduranga, Pandhari, Vitthal, Vitthalanātha and Vithobā. 

Vispu assumes in Prakrit the forms Vinhu, Vinnu, Venhu, Vetha and others. In Canarese Viṣṇu becomes Bitti, Bittiga, Vitta &c. The changes in names do not necessarily follow the rules laid down in Prakrit or Canarese grannars, which rules themselves are often based on meagre data and Mr. A K, Priyolkar in his learned paper on 'Bhagat Namdeo of the Sikhs' in the Journal of the University of Bombay vol. VI part 2 (1938) points out (p. 24) that in the Ādi Granth of the Sikhs, in the hymns of Namdeo, God is addressed as 'Bithal' or 'Bitbalu' (p. 24), that, in the Gujarati poems of Narsinh Mehta and Mirabai, God is addressed as Vitthala (p 35) and Vitthala is employed by these saints meaning only Viṣṇu and not the deity at Pandharpur. The learned Kāśinātha Upadhyaya, author of Vitthala-rn-mantrasāra-bhāsya, derives the word Vitthala as (Vit+thatla) 1636, 

As regards the name of the ksetra it appears that origi nally it was called in Canarese Pandarage, of which Pāndu ranga is & sanskritized form. When Pundlik, the devotee of Vitthal, became famous the sacred place came to be called Pundarikapura (as in Kūrma) and Paundarikapura (as in Skanda). Vide note 1632 above

** History of Dharmaśāstra - 

[Vol. The pilgrims to Pandharpur may be divided into two classes, regular visitors and occasional visitors. The first clasa comprise those called Vārkaris (lit those who keep the fixed times). The Varkaris ars of two sorts viz those who attend overy month and those who attend twide a year (on the 11th of Asadha-sukla and Kārtika-sukla), This cult of vārkaris has been a greater leveller. In theory and to a large extent in practice it ignores caste exclusiveness A brāhmans vārkari falls at the feet of a sūdra vārkarī. There are certain obser vazces binding on' all vārkaris (for which, vide Bom, G, vol. 20 p. 471). The vārkari carries ā rosary of Tulasi (basil) beads, foregoes' flesh-eating, observes a fast on ekādaśī, carries an ochre-coloured patākā (swallow-tailed banner) and is to speak the truth (and not to cheat) when engaged in his daily occupations. 

Some people think that the image of Vithobā is really Buddhist or Jain. There is hardly any evidence for this. When such Marathi poets and saints as Ekanatba, and Tukarām speak of Vithobā as Bauddhāvatāra they have Viṣṇu in mind, 1637 whose 9th avatāra was Buddha according to the Puranas and medieval writers. . 

The question of the attitude that modern Hindus should adopt towards holy places and pilgrimages will be briefly dealt with at the end of the next chapter on the list of tirthas.
