It is a miniature of Hindu life through the ages in all its great complexities and contradictions." />

  <p>CHAPTER XIII</p>
<p>KAŚĪ</p>
<p>There is hardly any city in the world that oan olain greater antiquity, greater continuity and greater popular Veneration than Banaras. Baparas has been a holy city for at least thirty centuries. No city in India arouses the religious emotions of Hindus as much as Kāśi does. To the Hindu mind it represents great and unbroken traditions of religious sanctity and learning. It is a miniature of Hindu life through the ages in all its great complexities and contradictions. Not only Hinduism with its numerous sects has flourished here for numberless centuries, but the principles of Buddhism, one of the great religions of the world, were first proclaimed here by Sākyanuni after he received Enlightenment at Bodh-Gayā under the Bodhi tree. Thousands of verses are found in the epios and purāpas about Banaras. Severa) volumes have been written about Banares during the last hundred years, 1465 It would be impossible to do justice here to this vast mass of literature on Banaras I shall briefly deal with the important topics relating to Banaras. In olden times the name was spelt as Benares, but recently as Banaras, which will be retained here (except in quotations).</p>
<p>Before proceeding further, it is necessary to dwell, however briefly, on the ancient history of Banaras The Satapatha Br. quotes 1406 a Gathā which states that Satanika, son of Satrājit, carried away the sacred sacrificial horse of the Kāsis, as Bharata did in the case of the Satvats. In Sat. Br. XIV.3. 1. 22 king Dhrtarāstra Vicitravirya is called Kaśye. In the Gopatha Br, we have 1407 the combination Kāśi-Kośalāh. The</p>

<p>Ancient 112story of Kūśi</p>
<p>Cambridge History of India (vol. I. p. 117 ) remarks that in the Brāhmana period Kāśi, the capital of the Kaśis, was situated on the Varadāvati. In the Br. Up. (II. 1. 1) and the Kausitaki 1408 Up. (IV. 1) there is the story of the proud Balaki Gārgya going to Ajātaśatru, king of Kāśi, with the assurance that the former would expound brahma to the latter. In Papini IV. 2. 116 Kāśi heads a gana (Kaśyādıbhyas-than-ithau&rsquo;). Under Panini IV.2. 113 ve get the form &lsquo;Kāśiyah.&rsquo; It is remarkable that in the Saryānukrama the rsi of Rg. X, 179.2 is stated to be Pratardana Kaśirāja. In tarpana, the Hir. Gr. (II, 8, 19.6) mentions Kāśi śvara along with Visou and Rudraskanda (S. B. E, vol 30 p. 244). Divodāsa figures frequently in the Rgveda. In Rg I 130 7 Indra is said to have conquered ninety cities for Divadāsa, while in Rg. IV. 30.20 it is stated that Indra gave 100 cities of stone to Divoāāsa. From these Vedic references it may be surmised that in later works like the Epics and the Purāpas Diyodāsa vas naturally credited with the founding of the most sacred city in India. In the Mahābhāṣya on Vartika 4 on Pan. IV.1.54 (vol II. p 223) we find the illustration &lsquo;Kasi-Kosalīyāh,&rsquo; The Mahābhāṣya (vo). IL P 413) furnishes the interesting information that there is a difference in the price of cloth manufactured at Kasi and that manufactured at Matburā, though the length and breadth of the piece of cloth be the same. This shows that even so early as the 2nd century B. C. Kāśi was famous for the fine qualities of its cloth, as now. 1409 From the above passages it is clear that Kaśī was the name of a country long before the Satapatha Br, was composed and it remained so till the 2nd century B.C. (the date of Patañjali). We have a parallel example. Avanti is the name of a country as shown by Pap IV.1.176 (striyām-avanti-kunti-kurubhyas-ca) and by the Meghadūta (Prāpyāvantin-udayane), but Avanti or Ayaptikā is also the name of Ujjayini (as in the well-known verse &lsquo;Ayodhyā&hellip; Avantika&rsquo;). Fa Hien (399 to 413 A. D.) is said to have arrived at the city of Vārānasi in the kingdom of Kāśi (Legge&rsquo;s tr. p 94). This shows that about 400 A, D. Kāśī was still the name of the district and Vārānasi was its capital. But from the reference in the Mahābhāṣya it appears that Kāsi had then become the name of the city (and was also</p>

<p>i voi, the name of the country) In the Agusāśana-parya (chap 30) it is said that Haryaśya, the grand-father of Dirodāsa, vas king of the Kāsis 1409a and was harassed and killed by the Vitabavyas in the Deab between the Ganges and Jumna. Haryaśva&rsquo;s son was Sudeva who was crowned king of Kası (verse 13, Kāśirajos bhyasinyata) and he also met the same fate as his father did. Then Dirodāsa, son of Sudeya, became king of the Kāśis and founded Vārāpasi thickly populated with men of all varṇas on the northern bank of the Gomati. This legend shows that Kāśī was the ancient name of a kingdom and the ancient belief was that Vārāpagi was founded as the capital of the Kāśis by Divodāsa. In the Udyogaparta also Diyodāsa is said to be the ruler of Kāsis.1410</p>
<p>The Harivamsa (I. chap. 29) has a long but rather confused story about Divodāsa and Vārāpasi 1411 It deals with the dynasty of Ayus, one of the sons of Aila. One of the descen dants of Āyus was Sunahotra who had three song, Kāśa, Sala and Grtsamada From Kāśa arose a branch called Kāsayah. Dhanvantari, a descendant of Kāsa, was king of the Kaśis (verse 22). Divodāsa was great-grandson of Dhanvantari. He killed 100 sons of Bhadraśranya, who first was Lord of Vārānasi, Then Śiva sent his gana Nikumbha to destroy Vāradasi which had been occupied by Diyodāsa, Nykumbha cursed it to be devastated for a thousand years When it became devastated it came to be called Avimukta and Śiva resided there it was again re-established (verse 68) by Dardama, a son of Bladrasredya, whom, because he was a child, Divodāsa had not killed Then Pratardana, son of Diyo dāsa, took it from Durdama Alarka, grandson of Divodāsa and king of Kāśis, again established Vārānasi This legend may contain some germs of truth, viz. that Vārānasi had become devastated several times and bad often changed hands. The Vayupurāna (chap. 92) and the Brahmapurana (chap. 11) also contain the same legends of Dhanvantari, Divodāsa, and Alarka and the vicissitudes of Vārānasi</p>

<p>In the Mahābhāṣya Patanjali states (vol. I. p. 380,) that Vārānasi is alongside of Gangā and on Pan. IV, 3. 84 (vol. II. P. 313) he informs us that traders call Vārānasi Jitvari.</p>
<p>Ancient Buddhist works show that Banaras was, in the times of Buddha (5th Century B O. at the latest), a great and famous city like Campā, Rājagrha, Srāvasti, Sāketa and Kauśāmabi (vide Mahāparinibbānasutta, S. B. E. vol. XI 2 99 and Mahāsudassanasutta, ibid. p. 247). The very fact that Buddha attained Enlightenment at Gayā (which was an out of the way place and on the borders, if at all, of Āryāvarta), thought it necessary to travel hundreds of miles from Gayā and preach his doctrines at Banaras in the Deer-park and set roll. ing the wheel of the kingdom of Dharma at that place, clearly indicates that Banaras had then become a very holy place and was in the centre of all Aryan activities and culture (vide S. B. E, vol. XI. p. 153 and vol. XIII p 90, Mahāvagga, S. B. E. vol. 17 p. 21). King Brahmadatta of Banaras figures in many Jātaka stories. Hardly any part of the jātaka tales can be placed earlier than the 3rd century B. O. But it may be admitted that Banaras was well-known as the capital of Brahmadatta kings several centuries before Christ. The Matsyapurāna 273, while enumerating hundreds of kings bearing the same surnames. states that there were 100 Brahmadattas and 100 Kāsis and Kuśas 1412 But the very fact that Brahmadattas are separately mentioned from the Kāśis largely reduces the value of this piece of information. The ancient Jain works also speak of Banaras and Kāśi, In the Kalpasūtra it is said that Arhat Parsya was born in Banaras in the month of Caitra on the 4th day of the dark fortnight (S B. E. vol. XXII p. 271) and that when Mahavira died the 18 confederate kings of Kasi and Kosala along with other kings of the Licchavis and Mallakis instituted an illumination on the day of the New Moon (ibid, p. 266). Aśvaghoga appears to identify Vārānasi with Kaśi when he says in his Buddhacarita &lsquo;Having entered Vārānasi. the Jina (Buddha) illumining the city with his light filled the minds of all the inhabitants of Kāśī with excessive interest.&ldquo;1413 The Buddhacarita further speaks of Buddha as having gone under the shadow of a tree near Vadārā (S, B, E, vol. 49 part 1 P.</p>

<p>In the Viṣṇupurīna we have the story of Paupdraka Vasudeva who challenged Krsna and asked the latter to surren der his Calora and other symbols He was helped by the king of Kāśi, The combined armies of Paupdraka and Kāsirāja attacked Krspa who killed Paundraka and cut off Kāsiraja&rsquo;s head (with his discus) which fell in the city of Kaśī. His son performed austerities, propitiated Śhaṅkara and secured from him a Krtyā (ogress) which entered Vārādasī. Krspa&rsquo;s discus in pursuit of her burnt the whole of Vārānasi together with its king, his servants and citizens In this account from the Vispupurāpa (V 34) the names Kāśī, Vārānasi and Ayimukta are employed as synonyms (verses 14, 21, 25, 30, 39). The same legend occurs in the same words in Brahmapurāna, chap 207 and is briefly referred to in Sabhāparva, chap. 14 18-20 and chap. 34. 11.</p>
<p>From the above-mentioned accounts in the Epic and Purāṇas about Kāśi and Mahādeya, various conclusions 1414 have been drawn by writers, viz, that Mahadeva was a god of the pon Aryans, that Banaras was a centre of non-Aryan worship for a long time after the advent of the Aryans and that the people of Banaras, though they ultimately turned to the Aryan religion, were more interested in the philosophic speculations of the Upanisadic age. I dissent from most of these conclusions. We are on most unsafe ground as regards these conclusions. None of the extant Purāṇas can claim to be older than the 3rd or 4th century AD Most people in India lived and even now live a humdrum, placid and unattractive life in which there is nothing to satisfy the ordinary man&rsquo;s appetite for the mysteri oug, the unusual and the horrible. The purāpas contain stories that may be divided into several classes and that satisfied the above-mentioned cravings of the common man. Many of the</p>

If any bistorical conclasion is to be drawn from this statement of the Nāradiyapurada it would be exactly, the opposite of what Prof. Altekar has drawn, V12, that the non-Aryans scored a cultural victory pyer the Aryaas at Badaras.623</li>

<p>IT) Conclusions from legends about Banaras</p>
<p>legends contained in the purānas were meant for the entertain ment of common people, just as even in these days millions in</p>
<p>Western countries read with relish detective stories and crime club fiction, Some paurāṇıc legends had a serious purpose in view viz emphasizing religious or philosophical dogma or moral values and standards and were clothed in a supernatural garb to make them striking and effective. Only a few legends have some historical basis, but the latter is evidently smothered in a mass of exaggerations and prejudices for or against a hero, or a caste, class, tribe or family. It is hardly fair to draw far reaching historical conclusions from heterogeneous materials in tihe purāpas about the conditions of things that prevailed several hundreds or thousands of years before they were compiled. The purānas often speak of the quarrels and bickerings abuong high gods and sages For example, the Vispupurāna V. 30.65 speaks of a fight between Indra and Krsna. Was Kropa a non Aryan god originally) Gapeśa&rsquo;s left tooth was shattered by the missile of Paraśurāma who comes to fight with Rāma, both being supposed to be avatāras of Viṣṇu. The sage Burgu curses Viṣṇu, Gautama curses Indra, Māndavya curses Dharma (vide for all these, Brahmānda II, 27. 21-25).</p>
<p>In several purānas Kāśī or Vārānasi has been lauded and described at great lengtli. Vide Matsya 180-185 ( 411 verses), Kūrma 1.31-35 (verses 226 ), Lingapurāna (pūrvabhāga, chap. 92, verses 190 ), Padma (Adikhanda 33-37, verses 170), Agni 112, Skanda, Kāśikhanda, chap 6 ff, Nāradiya (uttara, chap. 48-51). The Kaśīkbanda alone has about 15000 verses1415 on Banaras and its sub-tīrthas. In the Padmapurāna the sages are said to have asked Bhrgu five questions, viz what is the greatness of Kāsi, how it is to be understood, who should resort to it, what is its extent (or boundaries) and by what means it (Kāśi) can be secured. In the Skandapurada,</p>

<p>[Vol. Kāśikhanda 1416 (chap. 26.2-5) the following questions are asked, viz. from what time this holy place Avimukta became highly famous, how it received the nams Avimukta, how it became the way to moksa, how the pool of Manikarnikā became an object of worship to the three worlds, what was there formerly (when) the Ganges was not there, how it came to be called Vārānasi, Kaśī, Rudrāvāsa, how it came to be Ananda kānana (the forest of bliss ) and then Avimukta and Mahāśmaśāna ( the great cemetery ).</p>
<p>Banaras has been known for centurios under five different names viz. Vārānası, Kāsi, Avimukta, Āvandakānana and Śnasana or Mahasmaśāna. The Kāśikhanda states that Śhaṅkara first called it Anandakınana and then Avimukta, 1417</p>

(vide Prol Aiyangar&rsquo;s Introduction to Tirthakānda pp XVIII-XIX). Therefore a century or two at least before 1100 A D. there existed a Skandapurana, part of which contained a culogium of Banaras. Unfortunately the present priated Kāsil banda of the Shanda does not agree with the quotations from the Skanda given by the Kalpataru. A curious state of tbings is divulged as regards the quotations from Skanda in the Kalpataru. For example, on pp 36–37 of the Kalpataru on Tirtha, about 19 verses are quoted from Skanda which occur verbatim ip the Lingapurana, chap. 92. 120-142 (with the addition of some half verses) Similarly, od</p>

<p>The derivation of the word Kāść The derivation</p>
<p>625</p>
<p>A few words must be said about the derivation and significanos of these words as gathered from the Puranas and other works. And first comes Kāśi. It is derived from the root kas to shina.&rsquo; The Skandapurāpa 1418 says that the city of Kāśī became famous by that name because it sheds light on the way to) niryāna (final release) or because that indescribable refulgence, viz. God Śiva shines forth there. The name Vārānasi is derived in several Purāṇas from the names of two streams Varanā 1419 (modern Bārnā) and Asi, which are respectively the northern and southern boundaries of the modern city. From the passages quoted below from the Skandapurana (Kasi-khanda) it appears that Asi 18 the correct form of the name of the river, The names most frequently used in the Puranas are Varānasī and AvImukta. In the Jabalopanisad 1420 the words Avimukta, Varada and Nāsi are brought together in an esoteric sense. &ldquo;Atri asked Yājñavalkya: how is one to know the unmanifested Self? Yajāavalkya explained that he was to be worshipped in Avimukta, since the self is centered in Avimukta. Then &amp; question was asked: in what is Avimukta centered or established?

<p>wards off all faults due to the senses and Nāsi destross all sins due to the senses. Then a question is asked. that is its loca tion (sthāna )? The reply is that it is the conjunction of the eyebrows and the nose i. e, the upāsanā (contemplation) of Avimukta is to be made as located in the span betsoon the eyebrows and the root of the nose,&rdquo; Here it will be seen that Varapā and Nāsi are the names and not Varana and Asi). The Vamanapurāna employs the form Asi (15.50-53). Tho same is the case with the Padma.</p>
<p>The name Avimukta has generally been explained as derived from the negative particle &lsquo;na&rsquo; (for which &lsquo;a&rsquo;is substi tuted) and vimukta (forsaken). Many Purāṇas say that tho holy place is so called because it was never forsaken by Siya (some times both Śiva and his consort) 1421 In the Lingapurāna another derivation is suggested 1422 &ldquo;avi means &lsquo;sin&rsquo;; that holy place is devoid of sin&rdquo;. The Kāśikhanda (39.74 ) states that originally the ksetra was called Anandakānann and then Avimukta because though Śiva went to stay on Mandara mountain he did not leave it entirely but left his lingu thore</p>
<p>Vārānagl is very dear to Śiva, it gives him joy and there fore it is called Anandavana or Anandakānana, 1423 It is also styled Smaśāna or Mahāśmaśāna for various reasons As a belief was entertained by all people that death in Banaras frood a man from samsāra, and as the thoughts and aspirations of pious Hindus ran in the direction of dying on the sacrod soil of Banaras, the old and decrepit crowded theroin and persong seriously ill got themselves removed or wors removed to tho banks of the Ganges when about to die and pero cremated thera Cremation of corpses is always seen on tho Manikarniki ghūt near the Ganges.

<p>The Skanda says. 1424 * sma.&rsquo; means a corpse and &lsquo;sana ' means &lsquo;lying down &lsquo;; when the end of the world comes, the great elements lie here as corpses and therefore this place is called Mahasmasana.&quot; The Padmapurana 1425 makes Śiva say. Avi mukta is a famous cemetery becoming the Destroyer (or the Time Spirit) I being here destroy the vorld&rsquo;. Matsya very frequently speaks of Vārānasi as Smaśāna, The Kāsīkbanda states: if a man after reaching the great cemetery dies there by fate he has never again to lie in the cemetery (i. e. he is not born again).</p>
<p>Although generally Kāśi, Vārānasi and Avimukta are used as synonyms in the Purāṇas, in some passages a distinction is made between these as to extent. The passages quoted above (in note 1419) show that Varanasi is bounded by the Varana and Asi on the north and south,1426 the Ganges on the east and the shrine of Vinayaka in the west, Ain. A. (vol II p. 158) remarks that Benares is a large city situated between the rivers Barnā and Asi and that it is built in the form of a bow of which the Ganges forms the string. The Matsyapurāna 1427 states : &lsquo;that ksetra is two yoganas and a half east and west and half a yojana broad north and south; out of this Vārānasi extends up to the dry river (viz. Asi)&rsquo;. The first part appears to deal with the entire Kāśīksetra which according to the Padmapurāna 1428 comprised the tract covered by a circle the radius of which was the line joining Madhyameśvara-linga</p>

The Lingapurāna1431 says &lsquo;this ksetra is declared to be four Irosas (in extent ) in the four directions and also one yojana&rsquo;, The Naradiyapurana 1432 puts the extent thus (The ksetra) extends over two yojanas and a half from east to west and 19 half a yojana wide from north to south, god Sambhu declared the extent of the ksetra between the rivers Varunā and Asi (which latter is) a dried-up stream ' In the Padmapurana 1033</p>

<p>Ertent of Kasi in medieval works</p>
<p>Brahmā is supposed to have said to Rudra &lsquo;I have given you a ksetra of the extent of five krośas; when the best of rivers. Gangā, will flow through this ksetra, the city will be great and holy, the Ganges, as it flows northwards (in Banaras) for two yojanas, will be holy&rsquo;. If in any texts there be any differences between the extents of Arimukta, it must be supposed that there is an option,1434 (or, as the Tir. C. suggests, the differences refer to different talpas i, e, ages). It is clear that Vārānasi was that strip of land, the four boundaries of which were the Ganges to the east, Asi to the south, the shrine of Dehali Vinayaka to the west and the river Varanā to the north. In the 7th century Hiouen Thsang, the Chinese pilgiim, notes that Banaras was 18las (about 33 miles) in length and about 5 or 6 lis ( a little more than a mile) in breadth. This makes it clear that the city was then bounded as now by the Varapa and Asi.</p>
<p>Vide Beal&rsquo;s B R. W. W (vol II p. 44).</p>
<p>Verses laudatory of the greatness and uniqueness of Vārānasi literally run into thousands. All that can be done here is to set out a few characteristic verses. The Vanaparva observes, 1435 a person coming to Apimukta and resorting to the sacred place becomes free from the sin of brāhmana-murder by</p>
<p>merely seeing the (image of the) Lord of gods (i e. Visvesyara) and if he dies there he secures moksa. The Matsyapurana 1436 contains many striking passages about the unique greatness of Banaras &ldquo;Vārānasi is always my most secret place; it is always the cause of moksa for all beings. Moksa may be effected in Prayāga or in this city because I have taken it under my protection, this place is greater than even Prayaga, the forea most among tirthas. All the sins 1437 that a man may have</p>

<p>ingly all those are reduced to ashes when he enters Avimukta. Even a mleccha resident in Kāśī is better, since his future will be blissful, but not one residing elsewhere, though he may be a dikṣita, because he will not be a recipient of mukti.&quot;</p>
<p>Iu sone passages a mystic flayour is imparted to Vārāpasi and the rivers. For example, the Kāśīkhanda says that Asi is the Ida Dādi, Varaṇā is the Pingalā nādi, Avimukta is susumnā and Vārānasī is all the three.144 The Lingapurāna, however, puts the matter somewhat differently. It holds that Asi (the dried-up river), Varana and Matsyodarī (i.e. Ganges) are respectively the Pingalā, idā and Susumnā,</p>
<p>It is time now to turn to the individual sacred spots in Banaras. It is stated in some of the Purāṇas 1445 that at every step in the Kāśīksetra there is a holy place and that there is not eren as much space as a sesamum seed in Kaśī which has not a linga (emblem of Sira). As a matter of fact the Kāśikhanda names 64 lingas in chap. 10 alone. But one must look to the tirthas that are specifically named. Hiouen Thsang says that there were one hundred temples at Banaras in his day and he speaks of a temple where the copper image of Dera Mabesvara was a little less than 100 feet high (vide Beal&rsquo;s B R. W. W. rol. Il. pp. 44-45). Unfortunately, the fanatical zeal and ruth. lessness of Moslem rulers demolished almost all Hindu temples at different times from 1194 to about 1670 A, D, Mosques and mausoleums were erected on their sites, and the materials of the temples thus razed vera used in constructing mosques and for serving as breaksvaters &amp;c, Kutubdin Aibak destroyed about 1000 temples in 1194 A, D (vide Elliot and Dowson&rsquo;s</p>
<p>History of India&rsquo;, vol. II p. 222) Alauddin Khilzi boasted that he had destroyed one thousand temples in Banaras alone (vide Sherring p. 31, Havell p. 76). About 1585 A, D, Nārāyada. bhatta re-established the temple of Viśvanatha vith the help</p>

VII, P 184) is in structive: &ldquo;It reached the ears of his Majesty, the protector of the faith, that in the provinces of Thatta, Multan and Benares, but especially in the latter foolislı brahmanas were in the habit of expounding frivolous books in their schools and that students and learners, Musalmans as well as Hindus, went there even from long distances, led by a desire to become acquainted with the wicked sciences they taught. &ldquo;The Direc tor of the Faith&rsquo; consequently issued orders to all the gover nors of provinces to destroy with a willing hand the schools and temples of the infidels, and they were strictly enjoined to put an entire stop to the teaching and practising of idolatrous forms of vorship On the 15th Rabiu-akhir (i, e. December 1669) it was reported to his religious Majesty, leader of the Unitarians, that in obedience to order, the Government officers had destroyed the temple of Bishnath at Benares,&rdquo;</p>
<p>A mosque, which still existe, was built on the site of tha Viśveśvara temple by Aurangzeb, who even changed the name of Banaras to Muhammadabad. The result is that, as stated by Sherring (p. 32), it would be difficult to find twenty temples in the whole of Banaras of the age of Aurangzeb (1658-1707 A. D.). Many of the tomples were built by the Maratha Chiefs and Sarxlars and during the British ocoupation many more were built. Prinsep calculated in about 1828 that there were in the Banaras city proper 1000 Hindu temples and 333 mog ques; a more recent estimate puts the figures at 1454 temples and 27% mosques (Sherring 1447 pp 41-42).</p>
<p>Visyesvara or Viśvanātha is the tutelary deity of Banaras and the principal and most holy temple in it (vide n 1429 a) It is prescribed that every resident of Kāśi nust every day bathe in the Ganges and visit the temple of Visveśvara (vide Tri S p. 214).

<p>to place as the vicissitudes of the times required and the pil grims performed parts of the worship (such as nantaskara and circumambulation) at the site of the image, but they could not perform other portions of the worship such as bathing the image with Gadges water 1448 The present temple of Viśvanātha was built in the last quarter of the 18th century by Devī Akalyābar Holkar (Altekar, p. 57). The Tri. S. p. 183, while on the question of the appearance (prādurbhāva) of Viśveśvara, observes that there is no blemish in the case of the Visveśvara lipga due to the touch of the untouchable, that every day Viśreśvara removes it by a bath in Manikarnikā at dawn and the worship offered by Himself and quotes a verse of the Sanat kumāra-sainbita in support 1449 What the Tri. S. means is : Generally great care is taken about lingas. All and sundry are not allowed to touch them but in the case of the Viśte śvara-linga any one, even a great sinner, may worship it and pour Ganges water over it. Whether Nārāyanabbatta neant that even the so-called untouchables might touch it is not clear.</p>
<p>It appears that Vācaspati 1449a holds that Avimukteśvara lipga is the same as Viśvanatha, but both the Tristhalı-setu (296) and Tīr. Pr. (p. 187) reject this idea. The Skanda purāna (Kasī. 10. 93) mentions Visveśvara and Avimukteśvara as separate lungas. Besides Torshipping Vjśvanātha, every pilgrim to Benares has to visit the five tirthas 1450 (Pañcatirthi). According to the Matsyapurāna the fire essential tirthas in the Anandakāpana of Viśyeśvara are Daśāśvamedha, Lolarka, 14596</p>

<p>[Vol. Kesava, Bindumadhava and Manikarnika,151 In modern Times the five essential tirthas called Panoatirthi are the confluence of the Asi with the Ganges, the Daśāśyamedha ghat, Madi. karnikā, the Pañcagangā glāt and the confluence of the river Varana (valled Barna by the common people) with the Ganges. This is based on the Kaśīkhanda,1452 The shrine of Lojārka is situated at the confluence of the Asi (the southern boundary of Banaras) with the Ganges. The Kaśikhanda 1453 furnishes a popular etymology for the name Lolārka, viz. that the mind of the Sun on seeing Kasi became agitated. The Asi is a tolerably wide stream (about 40 feet) in the rainy season, but is dry at other times. The several gigantic ghats with their flights of stone steps are a grand sight at Banaras. The Ganges while passing by Banaras takes a great sweep so that its mighty current flows in a northerly direction that is towards the Himalaya) and is therefore held to be peculiarly holy hera, The Daśāśvamedha-ghāt has been famed for centuries, Jayaswal&rsquo;s interpretation of the epithets applied to the Bhara śivas in Vākātaka grants should be accepted viz, the Bhārasivas were an imperial dynasty, were crowned with the holy waters of the Ganges and took their ceremonial baths on the Ganges at the end of ten Aśvamedha sacrifices, on account of which the Dasasvamedha-ghat 1454 at Banaras was so named (Jayaswal&rsquo;s &lsquo;History of India&rsquo; 150 A.D.-350A.D p. 5).

<p>Daśāśvamedha-glāt and other tirthas 635</p>
<p>the Daśāśvamedhaghāt at dawn. For the eulogy of Daśāśva medha, vide Kāśikhanda 52. 83 ff and Tri. S, p. 159. The Kāśikhanda says that formerly the tirtha was called Rudrasaras, but as Brahmā performed ten Aśramedhas there it came to be called Daśāśvamedha (chap 52. 66-68). The Manikarpikā (also called Mukti-ksetra) pool is the very centre of the religious life of Banaras and 1455 is the most holy among all the Banaras tīrthas. The Kāśīkhanda gives a phantastic story of its origin (in chapter 26 verses 51-63 quoted in Tri. S. pp. 145-146): Visou dug with his discus a puskarini, filled it with the perspiration from his own body and performed severe austerities on its bank for 1050 (or 50000) years, Śiva came there and being pleased shook his head and an ear-ornament studded with jewels fejl into the pool, which thenceforward came to be called Mani. karnikā, The word is 1456 derived in two ways in the Kāśī. khanda. Śiva who is like the wish-yielding jewel whispers in the ear (karpikā) of good men the Tāraka mantra at the time of death. The extent of Manikarnikā north to south is said to be 105 hastas i e, about 160 feet (Kāśikhanda 99.54). In modern times the waters of the Manikarnikā pool become foul and fetid because it is shallow (two or three feet deep), because hundreds of pilgrims cast into it flowers and money by way of worship and because the priests stir the vaters with tñeir hands and feet to find the coins dropped by pilgrims. Our methods of worship must be changed The flowers and gifts should be placed on the banks of the pool and then taken away by the priests. The Tri S. p. 147 mentions several mantras (two of which are set out below) to be recited when contemplating on Madikardikā, 1957. Near the Mani. kard Ikā pool is the temple of Tārakeśvara so named from the belief that Śiva will whisper the mantra called taraka in the ear of</p>

<p>Voi. the dying man brought to the sacred pool1457a (vide Kaśikhanda 7.78, 25, 72-73 and 32. 115–116). The Pañcagangā ghāt 18 so called because it is supposed that five rivers, viz the Kıranā,1458 Dhūtapāpā, Gangā, Yamunā and Sarasvati, meet here (though four of them are invisible) This is very highly eulogised and it is said in the Nāradīyapurāna and the Kāśīkkapda (59, 118-133) that when a man takes a bath in the Pañcanada he is not born again in a body made up of the five elements. It is said that this confluence of five rivers had different names viz. Dhariyanada, Dhūtapataka, Bindutirtha and Pañcanada in Kr̥ta and the following Yugas respectively The Kāśikhanda in chap. 59 deals with the confluence of five rivers and gives phantastic legends as to why the rivers were called Kiropā (59. 108–113) and Dhūtapāpā (59 101-106). The river Varanā is the northern boundary of Vārānasi and the end of the ghāts on tlio northern side is reached at the confluence of the Varana with the Ganges. That the ghāts have been there for at least a thousand years can be proved from copperplates and inscrip tions. The Gāladvāla rulers of Kanoj (of whose times at least 55 copperplates and 3 inscriptions on stone were issued during the period 1097 to 1187 A. D), being devotees of Vispu, several times made grants at the Adi-Kaśava ghāt.

The Kāśi-khanda promises Varupa-loka to those charitable people that build stone ghāts on the sacred rivers 1460 ·</p>
<p>One of the most meritorious of all pilgrimages is the Pañcakrośi by road. Laksmīdhara in his section on Tirthas in the Kr̥tyakalpataru apparently takes no notice of it. The length of the Pancakrosi road is about 50 miles and there are hundreds of shrines on the road Taking Mapikarpıkā as the centre the whole road describes an irregular semicircle round the city of Banaras with a radius of five krośas (about ten miles) and hence it is called pancakrosi. The word &lsquo;pañcakrosi&rsquo; ocorre very often in the Kaśikhanda (as in chap 26, verses 80 and 114 chap 55 44). This pilgrimage may be very briefly described as follows:-The pilgrim starts from the Manikarnikā-ghāt and going along the bank of the Ganges arrives at the confluence of the river Asi with the Ganges and balts for the day at a village called Khāndava about six miles from Madikarpikā. The 2nd day&rsquo;s march (for eight or ten miles) ends at the village called Dhūpacapdi where he offers worship to the goddess of that name. On the 3rd day the pilgrim walks 14 miles to the village Rameśvara. On the 4th day he walks eight miles and reaches the village Śivapura. On the 5th day he walks 6 miles and reaches the village Kapiladhārā, where the pilgrim offers oblations to his pitrs On the 6th day he walks from Kapila. dhārā to Varanāsangama and thence to Manikarnikā, a diga tance of six miles It is the practice for pilgrims to scatter grains of barley from Kapiladbārā to Manikarnikā, The pil. grim batbes, pays dakṣınā to the priest and then goes to the temple of Sāksi-Vināyaka who is supposed to bear witness to the pilgrim&rsquo;s having performed the Pancakrosi-yātrā,</p>

<p>There are numerous other sub-tirthas in Banaras, some of which may be briefly noticed here. The Jñānavāpi may be mentioned first. The story of its origin is narrated in the Kāśikhanda, chap. 33. The Tri. S (pp. 148–150) refers to it, It is said that when Śiva (Isana) saw the Viśyeśvara-linga a desire arose in him to bathe with its cool water. He dug &amp; kunda with his trident to the south of the temple of ViśveśYAT&amp; and with the water therefrom he bathed Viśyeśvara-linga and Visveśvara granted the boon that the tirtha would be superior to all tirtbas and that, as Śiva is knowledge (verge 32), the tirtha would be called Jñanoda or Jūānavāpi. One of the most popular and the most frequented temple is that of Durgā. In chap. 72 (verses 37-65) of the Kāśikhanda there is a Durgāstotra called Vara-panjara which is referred to in Tri. S. p. 161. There is a temple of Bhairayanātha about a mile to the north of the temple of Visveśvara. He is the Kotwal or police Magistrate of Kāśi and wields a stone cudgel (of enormous thickness). His vāhana is a dog. Vide Kaśikhanda, chap. 30, for Bhairava, There are many temples of Ganeśa The Tri, S. (pp. 198–199) Dames 56 Ganesas and indicates their locations, following Kāśikhanda, chap 57 59-115 (sat-pancāsad-Gaja mukhan-etan-yah samamarisyati). In Kaśikhanda (57. 33) the name Dhundhi applied to Ganośa is derived from the root&rsquo;dhudhi&rsquo; in tbe sense of &lsquo;searching&rsquo; (anvegane dhudhir-ayam prathitosti dhātuh). Compare the Marathi verb dhuddane,</p>
<p>The Tri S. discusses at some length (pp. 98-100) the question whether sids committed in all past lives are destroyed by entering Kasi or whether it is only the sins committed during the present life that are destroyed. Some hold the view that sins committed in this life only are destroyed by visiting Kasi and by bath in the various sacred spots the sins of previous lives are destroyed, Others hold that by entering Kāśī the sins of all past lives are destroyed, but bath at various sacred spots brings about only the cessation of the tendency to sin in different lives, Nārāyapabbatta puts forward several other views and says that wise men should hold the view that appears proper.</p>
<p>Many of the purānas lay down rules about how one dwell. ing in Kāśi should act. The injunction is that in Kāsi ono should not commit the slightest sin, since the punishment 28 far more heavy. The Matsya (chap, 185, 17-45) and Kuśl khanda, chap. 96, narrate the story of Vyāsa, who whilo vandering about for alms in Kasi, did not secure alms and</p>

<p>being hungry and angry was on the point of cursing Kāśi in the words quoted below 1461 when Śiva coming to know his mind assumed the form of a householder, gave hita the best of food and ordered Vyāsa not to enter Kaśīksetra as he was an irri table man, but allowed hina to do so on the 8th and 14th tithis only. The Kaśikhanda 96. 12-80 and 119-180 speak at great length about how one residing in Kāsi should conduct himself.</p>
<p>Some miscellaneous matters in connection with Banaras may be set out here. Vārānası being a great tirtha, srāddha for the benefit of ancestors should be performed there and if it is not possible to perform a śrāddha with all details, at least offerings of pindas should be made.1452 The constiuction of mathas for those who practise penance there and endowing them with means for their maintenance are highly eulogized. 1463</p>
<p>In the 12th century AD, there was a Kapālamocanaghāt 1464 situated on the Ganges. In a grant published in E. I. vol. IV p. 110 dated samvat 1178 (112% A D.) the Emperor Govindacandra bestowed a village on a brāhmapa pamed Vyāsa after bathing at the Kapāla-mocapaghatta in Banaras where the Ganges flows to the north. The story of Kapalamocana-tirtha is Darrated in the Matsya-purana, chap. 183, 84-103 and a reference is made to it in Kāśikhanda 33. 116.</p>
