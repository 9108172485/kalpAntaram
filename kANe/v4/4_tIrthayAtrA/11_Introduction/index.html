  <p>CHAPTER XI</p>
<p>TIRTHAYĀTRĀ (pilgrimages to holy places)</p>
<p>All religions have laid great emphasis on the sacredness of certain localities and have either ønjoined or recommended with great insistence pilgrimages to them. Among the five incumbent practical religious duties1237 of a Moslem, pilgrimage at least once in kis life to Mecoa and Medina, the birth place and burial place of the prophet Mohammad, is one. The four places of pilgrimage for Buddhists have been the place of the birth of Buddha ( Lumbini or Rumpindei), the place where he attained perfect enlightenment (Bodh Gayā), the place where he set in motion the wheel of dharma by delivering his first sermon (at Sārnāth near Benares ) and the place where he passed away into the state of nirvana (Kusinārā). Vide Mahāparinibbanasutta (S B. E vol. XL. P 90). For Christians Jerusalem has been the holiest place and no religious com munity except the Christians undertook in historic times several great military pilgrimages, The crusades were launched to free the Holy Land of Christians from the domination of Moslems. In spite of what Gibbon says 1238 gomewhat oynically about those who joined the crusades, it must be admitted that there were thousands among the crusaders who risked their lives and fortunes in the pursuit of an ideal In India holy places have played a very important part. Large rivers, mountains and forests have always been venerated as sacred1239</p>

<p>1238 Gibbon remarks &lsquo;At the voice of their pastor, the robber, the sacendiary, the homicide arose by thousands to redeem their souls by repeating on the infidels the same deeds which they bad exercised against their christian brethren and the terms of atonement were eagerly embraced by offenders of every raok and denomination.

<p>Advantages of pilgrimages</p>
<p>553</p>
<p>and as the abodes of gods. In ancient and medieval India pilgrimages brought many advantages to the community as well as to the pilgrims themselves. Though India was divided into many kingdoms and the people of India followed several cults and sub-cults, pilgrimages tended to foster the idea of the essential and fundamental unity of Indian culture and of India also. Benares and Rāmeśvata were held sacred by all Hindus, whether they hailed from the north of India or from the peninsula. Though the Hindu community was broken up into numerous castes and suffered from caste exclusiveness, pilgrim ages tended to level up all men by bringing them together to the same holy rivers or shrines. The traditions associated with holy places, the discipline through which the pilgrims passed, association with holy and philosophic men and the whole atmos phere and environment at tij thas made it easy for pilgrims to remain at a high spiritual level and inculcated in them a mood of reverence that lasted long even after they returned from the pilgrimage, Pilgrimages supplied the much needed stimulus to draw ordinary men away from selfish pursuits and to make them think of the higher and more enduring moral and spiritual values These obvious benefits and the belief that a holy place was the abode of some divinity led ancient dharmaśāstra writers to lay emphasis on visits to tirthas The Visnu Dh. S, provides 1240 that the dlarma common to all men comprises the following: forbearance, truthfulness, restraint of the mind, cleanliness, charity, control of the senses, ahamsā, obedience to elders, visiting holy places, compassion, straightforwardness,</p>

Modern men whose faith in some of the aspects of the religious beliefs of our forefathers has beon weakened or altogether sapped by the sight of the profesional ministrants at the tirthas and their rapacity and ignoranco should not judge the ancient attitude towards tirthas harshly.</p>
<p>The word tirtha ocours frequently in the Rgveda and other Vedic sambitās. In several passages of the Rgyeda tirtha appears to mean a road or &amp; vay (0.g. in Rg. I 169 6 &lsquo;tirtha Dāryah paumsyāni tasthuh&rsquo;, Rg I 173 11 tirthe Dācchi tālrsādam-oko', Rg IV, 29, 3 &lsquo;karan-na Indrak sutirthabhayam ca.&rsquo; In some places tirtha may be taken to meau a ford in &amp; river, as in Rg VIII. 47. 11' &ldquo;sutirtham-arvato yathānu no nøsathā sugam &amp;c.', Rg. I. 46. 8 *aritram vam divas.prthu tirthe sindhūnām rathah'. In Rg. X 31 3 *trthe na dasmam upa yantyūmāk', tirtha probably means &lsquo;a holy place&rsquo;. On Rg VII. 19. 37 &ldquo;Suyāstya adhi tugvanı' the Nirukta IV. 15 explains that Supāstu is a Tiger and tuguan means &lsquo;tirtha&rsquo; (either a ford or a holy spot) In the Tai. S. VI 1. 2. 1-2 1245 it is said that the sacrificer is to bathe at a tirtha (probably a holy river ). The Rudras are said to prow} about tirthas (yo tirthāni pracaranto srkāvanto nisanginah) zo Tai S IV.5.11,1-2 and Vāj S. 16. 61 (reads &lsquo;srkāhastā). In the sankhāyana Br.iz!? it is said that Day and Night are the sea that absorbs overy thing and the twilights are the unfatbomable liitlas (of tho sea). Tirtha also means the way between the &lsquo;utkara&rsquo; and &ldquo;cātvāla&rsquo; pit for going to or coming from the sacrificial ground (the whāra ).1242&amp; Vide H of Dh vol II. p. 984,</p>
<p>It is said that, just as some parts of the human body (e. g. the right hand or ear) are held to be puror (than others), 80 some localities on the earth ara held to be very loly. Ifrtlas are held to be holy (on three grounds, viz.) on account of somo wonderful natural characteristic of the locality or on account of the peculiar strikingness (or grondcur) of somo satory placo or on account of the fact that somo (holy ) sages resorted to</p>

<p>them (for bathing, austerities &amp;c.). Tirtha, therefore, means a locality or spot or expanse of water which gives rise to the accumulation of righteousness (merit) owing to its own peculiar nature without any adventitious circumstance (such as the presence of Sālagrāma near it).1243 Or it is better to say that those localities that have been technically spoken of by vise and great sages as tirthas are tirthas, just as Pāvini employs such technical terms as Nadi and Vṛddhi in his grammar, The Skandapurāna 1214 says that a spot of the earth resorted to by ancient good men for the collection of merit is called tirtha and that the main thing is to go to (i, o associate with holy ) men and pilgrimage is only a secondary object,</p>
<p>In the Rgveda waters, rivers in general and certain named rivers 1245 are referred to with great reverence as holy and are deified. In Rg VII. 49 the refrain of all four verses is &lsquo;may the divine waters protect me&rsquo; (taapo devir-iha mamavantu). In Rg. VII. 49. 1 waters are spoken of as purifying (punanah ). RE. VII. 47,x.9,x. 30 1346 are hymns addressed to waters as divinities. They are said to purify a man not only physically but are also invoked to rid a man of all sins and lapses from the right path. The Tai S. II. 6.8.3 asserts that all deities are centred in waters (āpo vai sarvā devatah). In the Atharvaveda 1247 (I 33.1) waters are described as holy and purifying and are invoked to confer happiness. About twenty rivers in all</p>

<p>Sarasvati in the Rgveda</p>
<p>557</p>
<p>flood of the Sarasvati impinging by its powerful waves against the tops of hills is referred to in Rg. VI. 61. 2 and 8 1250. In VII, 96. 1, Sarasvati is spoken of as asuryā (of divine origin) among rivers. Sacrifices are said to have been performed on the Disadvati, the Āpayā and Sarasvati (Rg. II. 23. 4). In Rg. II, 41, 16 Sarasvati is called the best of rivers and goddesses (ambitame naditame devitame Sarasvati). Rg. I 3. 11-12 praise 1251 Sarasvati as a river and a deity, as a purifier (pāvaka), as the impeller of sweet but truthful words and the inspirer of good thoughts and as bringing to notice its great flood of waters. From Rg. VII, 95. 2, VIL 49.2 and I 71, 7 it is obvious that the Rgvedic sages know that the seven rivers fell into the sea. It would be proper to hold that the seven rivers are Sindhu (Indus), the five rivers of the Panjab and the Sarasvati. Though from the Rgpeda passages cited above it appears that in the times of the hymns of the Rgveda Sara Svati was a big river with abundant waters, that it flosed between the Yamunā and Sutudri (X. 75. 5), in the times of the Brahmanas it disappeared in the sands It is now gene rally identified with the modern Sarsuti which is lost in the desert at Bhatnair. The Vāj. S. 34. 11 says that five rivers together with their tributary streams fall into Sarasvati, 1252 There were three sattras called Sarasvata, viz the first in hon our of Mitra and Varuna, the 2nd for Indra and Agni and the third for Aryaman The diksā (consecration ceremony) was to be performed on the south bank of the dry bad of the Saras Vati where it disappeared underground 1253.

The land between Vinasana and Plaksa Prāsra vana (which was the sourca of the Sarasvati) was the proper locality for Sarasvata sattra, At the confluence of Sarasvati and Drsadvati an eṣti to Apam Napāt was performed wherein boiled rice (caru) was the offering.

Mount Parnassus north of Delphi was one of the most holy mountains in classical Greece and Olyaipus was supposed to be the home of the gods.

In Rg II, 331 the two great rivers Vipas (modern Beas) and Sutudri are described as issuing from the lap of mountains. Here the word &lsquo;Parvata&rsquo; is used in its ordinary sense.

<p>Effect of holy places on the mind</p>
<p>561</p>
<p>Being is partially revealed in such surroundings. In Protestant Europe and the U.S.A. hardly anyone performs a pilgrimage to a holy place in these days. Instead, they tour different countries for rest, health and in search of natural beauty and a respite from humdrum existence But pilgrimage to a place supposed to be holy for the curing of disease is not rare even now. When one reads a work like that of Louis Carell, a great surgeon and a winner of the Nobel prize, on the miracles worked at Lourdes in France (in a journey to Lourdes&rsquo;) one sees that pilgrimage has taken on a new motive in the West. Similarly, pilgrimage to the tombs of unknown warriors las become common owing to the two world wars.</p>
<p>In Rg x. 146 a large forest 1261 (Aranyani) is invoked as a deity. The Vamanapurana mentions 1252 seven forests in Kuruksetra as holy and as removers of sin, viz. Kamyaka, Aditirana, Vyasavana, Phalakivana, Suryavana, Madhuvana and Punyasitarana,</p>

The reward that a wan gets by visiting holy places cannot be secured by performing such sacrifices as Agnistoma in which large fees are paid (to priests); therefore visiting holy places is superior to sacrifices. But the Mahābhārata (Vadaparya 82, 9-12 and Anuśāsana 108. 3-4) Jays the greatest emphasis on the cultivation of high moral and spiritual qualities if the full reward of pilgrimages is to be reaped. It says 1264 &lsquo;He whose hands, feet and mind are well controlled and who possesses know ledge, austerities and a good reputation derives the (full) reward of pilgrimages. He who turns his face away from receiving gifts and is content with what little he gets and is free from vanity obtains the towards of pilgrimages, He, who is free from hypoc risy (or deceit), is not engaged in various undertakings (for earning money), is not a heavy eater, has subdued his senses and is (therefore) free from all sios; 80 also he who does not fly into a rage, who always speaks the truth, who is firm in his observances, and acts towards all beings by treating them like himself, obtains the full reward of pilgrimages. The idea seems to be that pilgrimages may help to remove the sins of men who are not possessed of the above characteristics, while those who possess these acquire a great store of merit in addition, The Skanda (Kāśikhanda 6.3) asserts &ldquo;snāng cannot bo predioated of a man whose body alone is flooded with water; that man who is plunged in restraint of senses, who is pure, relieved of all taint and is stainless, is alone to be called anāta&rsquo; (as having had a bath).

One who has no faith, who is full of sins, whose mind is not free from doubts ( about the rewards of pilgrimages and the rites there), who is an atheist and who is bent on bad reasoning these five do not reap the rewards of pilgrimages&rsquo;. The Skandapurāna (I. 1. 31, 37 ) remarks that all holy places, sacrifices and various gifts are meant for cleansing the mind (of its sins and sinful proclivities, manah-suddhi). The Padmapurana (IV. 80.9) remarks: sacrifices, vratas, tapas and dāna cannot be carried out fully in the Kali age; but bathing in the Ganges and taking the name of Hari are free from all defects, The Visbudharmottarapurāpa 1266 puts the matter very clearly when it says &lsquo;When resort is made to a tirtha, it removes the sins of the sinful and tends to the increase of merit in the case of the good and that a boly place yields fruit to men of all varnas and aśramas,&rsquo; Some of the Purāpas (such as Skandapurana, Kāśikhanda 6, Padma, Uttarakhanda, 237) say that in addition to the holy places on land (bhauma) there are certain virtues that may be called mental tirthas (in a figurative sense ). According to them &ldquo;truthfulness, forbear ance, restraint of the senses, compassion for all beings, straight-forwardness, charity, self-control, contentment, celibacy (brahmacarya), sweet speech, knowledge, patience, austerity, are tirthas and the highest tirtha is purity of mind.&rsquo; They further state that a man who is avaricious, wicked, cruel, hypocritical and immersed in pleasures of senses is still sinful and impure even if he bathes in all tirthas and that fish are born and die in holy waters but they do not go to heaven because their minds are not purified and that even charity, sacrifices, austerity,</p>

Wherever a man who has his senses under control may dwell, there are present Kuruksetra, Prayaga and Puskara&rsquo;, The Vamanapurana has a finet267a Rupala about the soul being a river full of the water of control, flowing with truth and having character as the bank and the vapes of compassion (for all beings) and states that the soul cannot be purified by water. The Padmapurana (II. 39. 56-61) extends the meaning and scope of tirthas by remarking that places where Agnihotra and śrāddha are performed, a temple, a house sphere Veda is being studied, a cowpen, the place where a soma drinker dwells, parks, a place where the Aśvattha .exists, a place where Purāṇa is being recited or where one&rsquo;s teacher stands or where a obaste housewife dwells, or where a father and &amp; worthy son dwell are all holy.</p>
<p>Numberless tirthas and holy shrines have been mentioned from ancient times. The Matsyapurada states 1268 that Vayu declared that there are 35 millions of tirthas in the sky, in the ærial regions and on the earth and all of them are centred in the Ganges; while the Vamanapurana 46. 58 states that there are 35 millions of Lingas.

<p>enumerated in detail even in hundreds of years. The Vanaparva 1269 remarks that Naimisa is the (best) tirtha on the earth and Puskara in the ærial region, while Kuruksetra is the most distinguished in all the three worlds and that all the ten thousand crores of tirthas are present in Puskara (chap 82.21 ) New tirthas were added from time to time and the monetary benefits derived by the permanent residents and particularly by the tirtha priests led them to prepare numerous mabātmyas of an apocryphal character and father them on Vyāsa, the reputed author of the Mahabharata and the Purāṇas. Most of the writers of digests on tirthas follow a process of selection. The Tirthakalpataru of Laksmidhara, one of the earliest digesta (about 1110-1120 AD), depotes more than half the work to Varāpasi and Prayāga alone, assigns only two or three pages to such famous tirthas as Puskara, Pṭthūdaka, Kokamukha, Badarikaśrama, Kedāra. The Nisimhaprasāda (Tirthasara) mostly deals with tirthas in the Deccan and southern India such as Setubandha, Pundarika (modern Pandharpur), Godavari, Krsna-venyā, Narmadā. The Tri. sthalīgetu of Narayanabhatta devotes two-thirds of it to Benares and its sub-tirthas and the rest to Prayaga and Gaya. This unequal treatment arose from various causes, such as the locali ties where the authors lived, their familiarity with the holy places and their predilections. There was also another tendency among the authors of Purāṇas, Mābātnyas and digests viz, that of great exaggeration and over-statement which is often repellent. If a man reads the description of one tirtha and does not discount much as sheer hollow laudation, he is likely to feel that a pilgrimage to a certain tīrtha will yield all the desires in this life as well in the next and that after visiting a holy tirtha like Kāśi or Prayāga he need not go to any other tīrtha, nor need he perform any yastia or act of charity and the like. A fesy striking passages may be cited here. The Vanaparva remarks that 1770 even gods and sages secured</p>

About this very tirtha viz. Puskara, the Padmapurāna says that there is no holier tirtha in this world. The Vanaparva (83. 145) in its eulogy of Prthūdaka asserts that Kuruksetra is holy, that Sarasvati is' holier than Kuruksetra and that Prthūdaka is holier than all other tirthas The Matsyapurāna puts the 1271 comparative holiness of several tirthas thus the waters of the Sarasvati purify after (one bathes for) three days, those of Yamunā in seven days, those of the Ganges at once, while the water of the Narmadā purifies a man at sight of it.&rdquo; In &lsquo;ita eulogy of Vārānasi the Kūrma-purapa states there is no place higher than Vārāpasi nor will there be one&rsquo; (I. 31 64). The inveterate habit of exaggeration goes so far that it is said that by merely residing in Kāśī till one&rsquo;s death not only does a man become free from the great sin of brāhmada murder but from the never-ending cycle of births and deaths and 18 not born again.1272 The Lingapurada says the same thing. The Vāmana. purāpa remarks 1273 that muhtı (release from samsāra) can be secured in four ways, viz, by knowledge of Brahman, by śrāddha at Gaya, by loss of life in repelling the carrying away of cows and by residence in Kuruksetra and that those who die in Kuruksetra never come down (to the earth) Mere residence in Kāśi was so much lauded that the Matsya (181 23), the Agni (112, 3) and other Purāṇas say that after repairing to Kāsī one should smash one&rsquo;s feet with a stone (in order that</p>

<p>The Brahmapurana classifies tirthas into four divisions 1775 yiz, daiva (created by gods ), āsura (those associated with such asuras as Gaya), ārsa (those established by sages ) such as Prabhāsa, Naranārāyaba and mānusa (created by kings like Ambarisa, Manu, Kuru) and provides that each preceding one is superior to each succeeding one. It enumerates six rivers to the south of the Vindhya and six rivers having their sources in the Himālayas as most holy and as devatirthas, viz. Godavari, Bhimarathi, Tungabhadrā, Venikā, Tāpi, Payasnı, Bhāgirathi, Narmada, Yamunā, Sarasvati, Visokā, and Vitastā. Similarly, Kāśi, Puskara and Prabhāsa are devatirthas (Tirthapr. r 18). The Brahmapurāpa (175. 31-32) assigns daiva, āsura, ārsa and manusa tirthas respectively to the Krta, Tretā, Dvāpara and Kali yugas,</p>
<p>There is a good deal of discussion in the Purāṇas and digests about those who are entitled or have the eligibility or capacity (adhikara) for tirtbayātra. The Vanaparva 1276 provides that brālmapas, ksatriyas, yaiśyas and sūdras, when they have bathed in holy places, are not born again. The same work further states that whatever sin a man or a woman may have committed from birth, the inoment a person takes a bath in the holy Puskara all that sin vanishes 1277 Therefore not only men but women also had the right to undertake tirthayātrā. The Matsyapurāna 1278 goes further and asserts that. Avimukta</p>

It was provided by the Brahmapurāpa that a brahmacāriu can undertake a pilgrimage only if ordered or directed by his guru, and that a booseholder whose wife is alive and is chaste must go on a pilgrimage with her; otherwise he would not reap the fruit of pilgrimage The Padmapurāna (Bhumikhanda chap. 59-60 ) narrates the story of a vaiśya called Krkala who went on a pilgrimage with out his virtuous wife and did not reap the fruits of a long pilgrimage (bhāryām vinā yo dharmaḥ sa eva piphalo bharebe 59, 33).

<p>sūdras.&rsquo; This was explained away by stating that this text refers to undertaking pilgrimage without the husband&rsquo;s pormis sion (in the case of a woman) and as to a sūdra in such a way as to be opposed to the primary duty of a śūdra to wait upon learned brāhmapas (as laid down in Madu X. 123). Kātya yana1282 as quoted in the Vyavahāramayūkha provides &lsquo;whatever a woman does that relates to (benefit in) a future state (i.e. state after death) without the permission of her husband&rsquo;s) father, husband or son, would become fruitless&rsquo; It is clear therefore that it was recognized early that tirthayātrā was a popular way for redemption of sins in the case of all classes of men and women. Though a Hindu woman succeeding as heir to her husband&rsquo;s estate has only a limited and qualified ownership over it, judioial decisions have recognized that she can alienate a small portion of her husband&rsquo;s estate for the expenses of a pilgrimage to Gayā for performing her husband&rsquo;s śrāddha for the latter&rsquo;s spiritual benefit or of a pilgrimage to Pandharpur.

<p>(Vol. There is a verse of Brlaspati: &lsquo;At holy places, in marriages, in a religious festival (or procession), in a battle, when there is en invasion of the country and when a town or village is on firo, no blaze attaches on the ground of incurring contact with untouchable persons or things,&rsquo;</p>
<p>In order to guard against the facile assumption that without a change of heart or change in one&rsquo;s sinful mode of life a more physical act of pilgrimage and bath in holy waters would be enough, some of the texts in the Mahablārata and Puranas adopted two propositions; viz the one noted above that it is the pure mind that is a real tirtha and further emphasized that it is better to stay at homo and perform all the duties of a householder including the perform ance of vedio sacrifices than to go on a pilgrimage. The Śkods parva 1785 in the dialogue between Tuladhāra and Jõjali (3 brābmana proud of his tapas) asserts that purodāsa is tho holiest of offerings, that all rivers are (holy lika) Sarasvati and all hillocks (and not merely Himalaya and the like ) are holy, that one&rsquo;s soul is a tirtha and advises Jajali not to be a gost (i. e. to be wandering in quest of tirthas ) to several countries, The Tirthagintāmaṇi and Tirthaprakaś&amp; quote passages from the Brahmapurāpa that a brāhmaps should yander about tirthas after his capacity to perform sacrifices has come to an end, that it is better for a man to stay at home and porform the duties of an householder when he has the capacity and authority to perform rstis and arnas, and that all the tirthas: do not come up in their rovards) to the performance of agnihotra. 1226 The Kūrmapurāna 1287 has the following remark able verses on this point.

<p>Who may resort to pilgrimages</p>
<p>541</p>
<p>IV]</p>
<p>pilgrimage in this world as well as in the next. A person who has to undergo an expiation (for a sin), or who is a widower or who is a householder of the yāyāvara 1288 type or similar persons may resort to pilgrimages. One may go to holy places with his vedic fires or with his wife; he becomes free from all sins and secures the best goal as stated above. One who wants to go on pilgrimages should pay off the three debts, should provide means of maintenance for his sons and should consign his wife to their care.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ancient writers on Dharmasastra favoured pilgrimages by prescribing, as stated in the Visau Dh. S, that 1289 no money was to be demanded from a Vedic student, a forest hermit, an ascetic, a pregnant woman and a pilgrim by a forryman or by &amp; toll officer and that if he took money from such persons he was to be made to return it. But this prescription was not invariably followed even by Hindu Kings The Rājatarangin (VI 254-255 and VII, 1008) notices that a tax was levied on Kashmirians performing sraddhas at Gayā.1296 It appears that Siddharāja king of Anahilavād (1095–1143 A. D.) levied a tax on pilgrims going to Somanatha at the frontier town Bābuloda, that he remitted the tax at the intercession of his mother and that the tax thus remitted amounted to 72 lakhs of rupees every year (this last may be an exaggeration to glorify Siddharāja),1290 a Moslem kings levied this tax. It appears that a great writer called Kavindrācārya took up the cause of Hindu pilgrims visiting Prayāga and Kāśī and so eloquently pleaded it before Emperor Shah Jehan that the latter remitted the tax altogether</p>

<p>The digests quote certain verses of the Brahmapurana about the rites to be performed when a person decides to start on a pilgrimage. The Brahmapurāna provides that the intend. ing pilgrim should restrain his senses the previous day, should observe &amp; fast and on the next day he should offer for ship to Ganeśa, the gods, the pitrs and honour good brābmanas according to his ability and when he returns from the pilgrimage he should offer similar worship and honour. 1994 The digests</p>

He should perform sraddha in which there is plenty of ghee, honour three brāhmadas (at least) with the offer of sandalwood paste &amp;c. and then make a resolve (sankalpa) to go on pilgrim age The Vayupurāna 1295 and the digests lay down that (after the worship of Ganesa, the planets and the deities) he should put on the dress of a kārpatī viz. wear a copper-ring, a copper bracelet and reddish garments. Bhattoji (p 5) states that according to some the apparel of kārpatika is to be put on by a pilgrim going to Gayā. The Padma (IV. 19. 22) prescribes the pilgrim&rsquo;s dress for other tirthas also. The Tīr, O. adds that this dress is to be worn only on the journey to a tīrtha, when the pilgrim is in a tirtha, but not at the time of performing his daily duties such as taking meals (p. 9).</p>
<p>There is a difference of opinion among the digests as to whether tonsure of the head is obligatory when starting on a pilgrimage. The Padmapurāna 1296 and Skandapurana appear to make it obligatory. The Tirtha-Kalpataru does not 1297 refer to tonsure at all, while a fast at a tīrtha is declared by it to be optional. The tendency of later digest-writers is generally to make every religious act more elaborate and harder. The tonsure of the head and beard was prescribed for a sacrificer</p>

<p>Tonsure for women at tīrthias</p>
<p>575</p>
<p>in the case of women whose husbands are living only two finger breadths of hair are cut. Vžddha-Hārita (IX. 386-387) lays down that in the case of women whose husbands are living tonsure of the head should not be carried out, but that holding up all their hair only three finger-breadths should be cut off. Other smrtis like Āpastamba in verse (I. 33-34), Angiras Verse 163, Yama 54-55, Parāśara q. by the Mitāksarā on Yāj. III, 263-264 lay down that tonsure is limited to the cutting of two finger-breadths of hair in the case of woman (nārī). Par, M. 1302 I. 1. p. 291 reads &lsquo;evam nārīkumārinām&rsquo; and holds that nāri means here &lsquo;a woman whose busband is alive&rsquo;. Although tlę smrti passages occur in the section on prāyaścitta still by analogy they are to be applied to the tonsure in holy places. As regards widovs, ascetics 1303 and śūdras all hair are to be cut. The Tirthaprakāśa finds fault with Vācaspatimiśra for saying that there is no tonsure on the Ganges. When there is such a conflict of views, the final decision rests with the usage of each country or the individual&rsquo;s choice. The Tir. K. (p 10) appears to hold that honouring the pitrs at the time of starting on a pilgrimage is specially obligatory on a man with means. The texts make a difference between ksaura and mundana. The latter means &lsquo;shaving the hair on the head as well as the mousta ache and beard,&rsquo; while ksaura means only shaving the head, Therefore the Nāradiya says that all sages did not prohibit ksaura even at Gayā but only mundana is forbidden there 13034 and there is no mundana on the Ganges anywhere except at Prayāga The Tirthendusekhara (p 7) gives it as its opinion that tonsure and fast are not obligatory but are only kāmya (1, e. to be done if certain rewards are desired) and points out that śistas do not resort to these two at many tirthas.</p>

<p>The Purāṇas and digests devote some attention to the inode of travel, The Matsya (106. 4-6) states that 1304 if a pilgrim goes to Prayāga in a conveyance drawn by bulls he falls into hell and his pitrs do not accept the water offered by him at the holy place and if a pilgrim because of riches or avarice or foolishness goes in a conveyance (not drawn by bulls) all his effort (as a pilgrim) becomes fruitless and therefore a pilgrim should avoid Journey in a conveyance. According to the Kalpataru (on Tirtha p. 11) using a conveyance is forbidden only in the case of pilgrimage to Prayāga (and pot in the case of other tirthas), while the Tir, C. (p. 8) and Tir, Pr. (p. 45) quote a verse 1305 which provides that if a pilgrim uses a cart drawn by bulls he is guilty of govadha (kıllıng a cow), if he travels on horse-back (or in a horse-drawn carriage) his pilgrimage yields no fruit, if he is carried by men (in a palan quin or the like) he secures only half the merit but if he travels bare-footed then he wins the full merit. The Padma-purana (IV. 19. 27) has a similar verse. The Tīr. Pr. p. 34 quotes a yerse from the Kūrmapurāna that those who are unable to perform a pilgrimage otherwise do not incur blame (or Joss) by making use of a conveyance drawn by mon or a chariot which is drawn by mules or horses. Similarly, a verse of the Viṣnupurāna 1306 quoted by both Tir O and Tir. Pr. (pp. 34-35) provides that one should always go on a journey wearing shoes and holding an umbrella in the rains or in summer and armed with a staff at night or 10 &amp; forest. The Visnudharmottara takes a more practical view when it says that to make a pil</p>

<p>Declaration before starting</p>
<p>5474</p>
<p>grimage on foot is the highest tapas (austerity) and that if a pilgrimage be made in a conveyance the pilgrim will reap only the Teard of the bath. The Tir. Pr. (p. 35) allows the use of a Tessel to reach holy places like Gangāsāgara which cannot be reached otherwise.</p>
<p>The Tristhali-setu (pp. 1-3) has a long discussion about the sajhalpa 1507 (declaration) to be made at the time of start ing on a pilgrimage. The conclusions reached are that the declaration should not include the dames of all the holy places intended to be visited, but should expressly state the last one up to which one desires to go, that persons from southern or Western India should make a sankalpa about Gaya (and pilgri mage to Prayāga and Kāśi vill be implied) and that a person from East India should make a sankalpa about Prayaga (and pilgrimage to Gaya and Kaśī will be included as a matter of course) and that (as an alternative method) a man from south or vest India should at first make a sankalpa about pilgrimage to Prayāga, then while in Prayāga he should make a sankalpa about visiting Kāśi and then in Kāśī he should make a sankalpa about visiting Gayā, A pilgrim from Eastern India should first make a sankalpa about Gayā, then, while in Gaya, he should make one about Kāśī and so on. The Tīrthaprakāśa (p. 326) appears to criticize the first method proposed by the Tristhslisetu and states its own view to be that those who intend to visit many sacred places should make a sankalpa in the form &lsquo;I shall perform pilgrimage&rsquo; (Tirtha-gātrāmalam karisye). The Tirthaprakāśa, however, approves of the second method proposed as an alternative.</p>
<p>That the merit of a pilgrimage could be collected in a vicarious manner is laid down by the Smrtis and Puranas. Atri (50-51) provides 1305 &lsquo;He for whom an effigy nade with kuśa grass intending it as a representative is dipped in the waters of a holy place secures one-eighth part of the merit (that he rould have secured by himself bathing in the waters).

<p>History of Dharmasastra of his mother, father, brother, friend or guru, these latter receive one-twelfth of the fruit (of the pilgrimage). Another verse of Paithinasi says that he who yisits a holy place for money (wages) from another gets only a 16th part of the merit, but he who goes to a tirtha while bent on another purpose or errand (such as study, business, waiting on a guru) 1309 reaps only half the merit. The Virpudharmottara has a similar verse. It was owing to this idea of collecting morit and God&rsquo;s Grace that wealthy men built Dharmaśālās, tants, and annasattras and wells for the conveniences of pilgrims and the planting of trees by the sides of roads had in view the comfort of pilgrims as yell as of the general public The Prabhasa khanda remarks &lsquo;A wealthy man who enables another to perform pilgrimage by providing his own money or conveyances gets one-fourth of the merit of the pilgrimage.&rsquo; 1310</p>
<p>The Prayascittatattva of Raghunandana quotes from the Brahmāndapurāna some verses which enumerate fourteen acts that a pilgrim has to give up after reaching the Ganges viz, sauca (punctulious performance of bodily purification), acanana (sipping water on various occasions in the day), hai (dress ing), wearing nirmalya (flowers taken away after being offered in worship), repeating the Aghamarsana hynn (Rg. 190, 1-3), shampooing the body, sports, acceptance of gifts, sexual dalliance, devotion to another tirtha, prazsing another tirtha, the gift to others of clothes (worn by oneself), striking any one and swimming across the water of the tirtha,</p>

<p>Tirtha brāhmanas to be preferred</p>
<p>579</p>
<p>one should not enter upon an examination of the worth of brahmanas at holy places and this view is endorsed by seve ral digests such as the Kalpataru on tīrtha (p. 10), the Tir. C. (p. 10) and the Tir. Pr. ( 73). The last work remarks that brāhmanas who are known for certain to possess defects deser ving condemnation should be avoided. The Varābapurāna goes1312 so far as to say that at Mathurā a pilgrim should prefer to honour a brāhmana born and bred up in Mathurā rather than a brahmana who has studied the four Vedas (but is a stranger to Mathurā). Similar passages from the Vayu and Skanda purāna have been quoted above in note 910 and there is another similar passage in Skanda, It is provided by the Vayupurana1313 that when a son goes to Gayā, he should invite only those brāhmanas that have been settled in Gaya by Brahmā and that such brāhmanas are above ordinary mortals, that when they are gratified the gods together with one&rsquo;s pitts become pleased, that one should not enter upon a consideration of their family, their character, their learning or their custorities and that when the Gayā brābmanas are honoured the man doing so secu res release (from samsāra). In Vāyu 106 73-84 and Agni 114, 33-39 and Garuda it is narrated that, after Gayāsura fell down and asked for boons which were granted by Vispu, Brahma bestowed upon the Gayā brāhmanas 55 villages and Gayātirtha extending over five krośas, gave them well-appointed houses, desire-yielding cows and trees, but he enjoined on them not to beg or aocept a gift from others. The brāhmanas, however, greedy as they were, officiated at a sacrifice performed by Dharna (Yama) and begged him for fees and accepted them, Then Brahmā cursed them that they would always be in debt and took away the Kamadhenu and Kalpavrksa and other gifts, The Agnipurāpa 1314 (114. 37) adds that Brahmā cursed them to be bereft of all learning and to be full of greed. The brāhmanas then begged Brahmā to favour them with some means of liveli. hood (as they had been deprived by the curse of Brahmā of all that had been bestowed on them), Brabnā pitied them and told them that they would maintain themselves at Gaya-tīrtha</p>

<p>(Vol. till the end of the world and that those who would perform śrāddha at Gayā and worship them (by engaging them as officiating priests and pay them) would secure tho morit of having worshipped Brahmā From this it is clear that the Gayā brahmanas at the time of the composition of the section on Gaya at the end of the Vayupurāna possessed the same characteristics as the modern Gaya brāhmanas (Gayāls or Gayāwals as they are called) and made the Gayā pilgrimago their business even then (as now). One of the early historic references to Gayāl brāhmanas occurs in the Saktipur copper plate of king Laksmadasena of Bengal in his 6th year (i, e. about 1183 A D.) 1315,</p>
<p>The result of this teaching of the Puranas was that thio brahmanas at Gayā became a guild or a close corporation and the Gayāwals resent the intrusion of an outsider. Disputes between Gayāwals and outside priests and cases of Gayānals have come before the courts and have gone up even to the Privy Council in England. It has been &amp; usage for Orthodox Hindu pilgrims going to Gayā to share themse)ves at the river called Punpun, 1315a then on arrival at Gayā to worship the feet of one of the Gayāwal brahmanas. The Gayāval himself or his agent takes the pilgrim to the sacred spots (Vedis) in and around Gayā. The priest is paid a fat fee 110ar the Aksaya-vata and the Gayāwal puts a garland of flowers on the folded hands of the pilgrim and pronounces the word &lsquo;suphala&rsquo; and utters a blessing that the pilgrim&rsquo;s ancostors would go to heaven on account of the pilgrim&rsquo;s visit to Gayā. In order to keep this business in their own families tho Gayāwals have adopted loose and peculiar customs. If a Gayāwal is sopless be makes a gift of his offico (called gūdı or gaddı) to another Gayāwal, who describes himself as the adontod son of the Gayāwa) making the gift. There is no real adoption in the strict sense. Therefore, the so called adopted son retaina his rights in the family of birth, he is not severed from his natural family and it is not rare to find that one Gayūwal claims to have succeeded to four gūdis (i. 8. claims to bo the son adopted by several persons simultaneously). The Gayasals have got books in which they enter the names and addresses of</p>

Thus large incomes and properties come to the hands of the Gavāwals. They send their agents throughout India, who bring as many pilgrims as possible. In Lachman Lal v. Kanhaya Lal the Privy 1316 Council had to deal with the case of a Gayāwal who claimed to be an adopted son without loss of his interest in the property of the natural family on the ground of these peculiar practices of the Gayāwals and that claim was upheld. In Lachman Lal v. Baldeo Lal 1317 the Patna High Court gives a brief summary of the origin, history and customs of the Gayāwals, remarks that though in former times there were several hundred families of Gayāwals their number is now reduced to about 150, that the Gayawals so-called gaddı is not a hereditary office, but only a business to which a good will is attached. The Calcutta High Court decided in Dwarka nath Misser 1318 v. Rampertab Misser that persons wbo require religious ceremonies to be performed for their benefit are at liberty to choose the priest by whom they shall be performed, that plaintiffs are not entitled to a declaration that they along with defendants are exclusively entitled to officiate as priests when pilgrims, on their way to the holy city of Gaya, perform the śrāddha ceremony of their ancestors on the bank of the sacred river Punpun, and that the plaintiffs could be given a declaration that they are entitled to officiate as priests for such pilgrims as may choose to employ them for the pur pose of religious ceremonies and that the defendants are not entitled to prevent the plaintiffs from the exercise of their calling. In Narayan Lal 1319 v. Chulhan Lat the Calcutta High Court decided how the books containing the names and addresses of pilgrims kept by a joint family of Gayāwals were to be divided at the time of the partition of all the properties of the family.</p>

<p>contain on a very -modest calculation at least 40000 verses on tirthas, sub-tirthas and legends connected with them. In the Vanaparva (chap. 82–156) and Salyaparya (chap. 35-54) alone there are about 3900 verses on tirthayātrā. To mention only a few of the Purāṇas, the Brahinapurāna devotes about 6700 verses (i. e, nearly half of its total extent of 13783 verses) to tirthas, the Padma about 4000 verses out of the 31000 verses of the first five khandas, the Varāhapurāna deyotes about 3182 verses to tirthas (out of which about 1400 refer to Mathura) out of about 9614 verses, the Matsya about 1200 verses out of 14002. Besides these, the following well-known digests and works on tirthas deserve mention. The Tirthayiyecana-kāpda of the Kalpataru of Laksmidhara (G,0.8. series); the Caturvarga-1320 cintamani of Homādri (1260-1270 A D) contained a section on tirthas (20 Ms. has yet been discovered), the Tirthacintamani of Vācaspati (1450-1480 A. D.) published in B. I series, the Tirtha sāra, part of Nrsimhaprasāda about 1500 A. D. (published in the Sarasvatī-bhavana geries); the Tristhalīsetu of Nārāyanabhatta (about 1550-1580 A. D.) printed by the Anandāśrama Press, Poona; Tirthasaukhya, a part of Todarānanda (1565-1589 A.D.), Tirthatattva&rsquo;or Tirthayātrāvidhitattva of Raghunandana whose Jiterary activity lies between 1520-1570 A D. (printed in Bengali characters and over and above the 28 tattvas of his Smrtitattva), Tirthaprakasa by Mitramiśra about 1610-1640 (published in the Chowkhamba Sanskrit series), the Tristha līsetusāra-sangraha of Bhattoji (about 1625); Tristhalisetusāra sangraha of Nāgesa, the Tirthendusekhara of Nageśa or Nāgoji (published in the Sarasvatibhavana series, Benares, 1936 ). There are several works on tirthas (not yet printed) mentioned in H, of Dh, vol 1, p. 554, of which the Tirtharatnakara of Anantabhatta composed at the order of Anūpasimha is probably the largest work on tirthas (ms 10. 1822 in the Anup Library at Bikaner). Besides these there are special works on indivi</p>

<p>The preliminaries before starting on a pilgrimage to any tirtha prescribed by the purāsas and digests may be brought together. On a certain day (when a person has decided on tirtha-yātrā) he should take only one moal, then the next day be should shave himself (according to most digests) and observe a fast, then on the day after the fast he should performi bis daily duties, should make a sankalpa (declaration of intention) in the form &lsquo;I shall perform a pilgrimage to such and such a place and I shall worship Ganeśa and my favourite deities for the accomplishment of the pilgrimage without obstacles&rsquo;; offer worship to Ganesa, to the planets (nine) and his favourite deities with five or sixteen upacaras,1322 then perform a pāryada-grāddha with plenty of ghee according to his own grhyasūtra, honour three brāhmapas at least and donate some money to them. Then he should put on a pilgrim&rsquo;s dress as described above (p. 573), go round the village in which his house is located (or at least round his own house), reach another village not more distant than one Krosa (two or two and half miles) and break his fast by eating the remainder of the food cooked and ghee used for the Śraddha (this applies to pilgrimage to Gaya). He may break his fast</p>

Then the next day he should bathe with pure clothes on and then put on his pilgrim dress and start on his pilgrim age in the forenoon with his face to the east, preferably bare-footed. There are two views here. Some say that on the day on which a man reaches a tirtha he should observe a fast, while the other view is that the pilgrim should fast on the day previous to his reaching the tirtha. In the first case he will have to perform a śrāddha on the day of the fast and in that case he cannot actually taste the remnants of śrāddha food but should only smell the cooked food The Kalpataru (on tirtha p 11) and the Tīrtha-cintāmani (p 14) quote Davala for the proposition that a fast on reaching a tirtha is not obligatory, but if observed yields special merit,</p>
