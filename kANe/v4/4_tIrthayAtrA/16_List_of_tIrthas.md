CHAPTER XVI - - LIST OF TĪRTHÁS 

This is merely a list of tirthas from the point of view of Dharmaśāstra and not a treatise on the Ancient Geography of India. The result is that many countries and towns that have no importance or claims as tirthas have been altogether omitted. Bauddha and Jain works on tirthas have only rarely been referred to Many of the Puranas enumerate the moun tains and rivers of drīpas and ursas other than those of Jambudvīpa and Bhārata-yarsa such as Harivarsa, Ramyaka. varsa, Krauñcadvipa, Salmalidvips, but they have been exclud ed from this list. The Brahmapurana (chap. 26 verses 8-83) contains a string of over 520 tirthas without hardly any certain indication of their location and the Bhismaparka in chap. 9 mentions about 160 rivers with practically no indication about their location in most cases Similarly, the Garuḍa (L. 81, 1-31 ) enumerates about 200 and Padma (VI. 129) contains 108 tirtha names. In Banaras alone I have, listed about 350 sub tirthas. But there are about -1500 shrines and temples in Banaras alone. These have not been included. Each great tirtha has numerous sub-tirthas as in the Varāba-purāna under Mathurā, in Brahma-purāpa under Gautami, in Vāyu-purāna under Gayā. Through sheer weariness or inadvertence some of these must have been left out by me and some vere left out purposely on account of the absence of any importance Besides, several tirthas that are regarded as sacred by modern people are not so treated in the Epics or purānas' and are not even mentioned in them; many of these have been omitted in this list Our authorities are often very vague about the location or extent of tirthas Moreover, a number of tirthas scattered in different parts of India bear the same name (e. g. vide under Agnitirtha, Kotitirtha, Cakratīrtha, Varāhatīrtha, Somatirtha) I am under great obligations to Cunningham's 'Ancient Geography of India' (ed. of 1872) and to Nundo Lal Dog's 'The Geographical Dictionary of Ancient and Medieval India' (1927). I have had occasions to differ from both, particularly from the latter. But, the space at my disposal baing very limited, I could not enter into even brief discussions

History of Dharmasastra in support of my views. It would look ungrateful to find fault with the work of Dey; but it must be said that he relies too much on rathor old and antiquated authorities and has not cast his net over a wide area. Often times he mentions no original authoritios (vide, for example, Cakratirtha on p. 43). II. is very vaguo in his references, He hardly ever cites the number of the verso on which he relies and often omits to specify ovon the part or section of the work relied upon. For oramplo, at p. 13 as regards Avanti he mentions Pānini IV. 176, which should bo IV. 1. 176. Turther, he has omitted several well-known tirthas (c. g. Daśāśvamedhika). He is sometimes wrong in what he says. On p. 54 he states that Kiskindhā. kānda 43 refers to Dovadarurana as a proper name, but there the contoxt ('lodbrapadoaka-sandesu dovadāruvanesu oa''in vorso 15) shows that what is meant is 'forests of Deodar trees'). On p. 13 he says Bharatayarsa was' first'called Haimarata varsa, but the passage of the Lingapurana (I. 49.7) on which ho relios (idam haimaratam varsam Bhāratam nāma viśrutam) does not hear that out. There is no reference to a prior account hero and all that is meant is that Bharata varsa is connected trith Himavat, as a previous passage (I. 47, 23 Himadrer daksidom varsam Bharataya nyayedayat) expressly states that Bharatiyarse is to the south of Himalaya, In Salya 44.52 Sarasvati is called Haimapati, but that does not mean that Haimarati was the name of Sarasvati in far-off ages It simply means that it rises in Himayat range.' Only a comparison of the list propared by me with Day's work will show the differ once in details between the two. I should not undertake that task and leave it to scholarly readers, 

I have corefully read the two Epics and most of the Purūnas. But I do not cite exhaustive references to all the texts there a particular tirtha is mentioned. I feel satisfied with mentioning two or three. Owing to the several restric tions imposed upon myself this list cannot claim to be thoroughly exhaustive. But I hope that it is comprehensive enough'and far larger and more informative than any list of tirthas presented by any scholar so far, There is ample scope for industrious scholars to improve upon and to add to this list. I have included important tirthas from Kashmir and given copious references to the Nilamata-purāpa, the Rāja-tarangini and the Hara-carita-cintamani. I am highly obliged to the Kashmir Report of Dr. Buhler (published as a special number for 1877 

"

by the B BRAS), to Stein's notes in his translation of the Raja-tarangini and his memoir on the Ancient Geography of Kashmir published separately (and also embodied in the 2nd volume of the translation of Kalhana's work). All the names of tirthas are transliterated into the English alphabet and arranged according to the English mode of spelling. For the Mahābhārata references are given to the oblong Bombay edition and by citing names of parvans, but in the case of the Rāmāyana Roman figures I to VI are employed for the Bala, Ayodhyā, Aranya, Kiskindhā, Sundara, Yuddha and Uttara kāndas respectively. For the Rāmāyana I have used the edition brought out by the Madras Law Journal Press in 1933. Among Purāṇas the Anandāśrama editions of the Agni, Brahma, Brahmavaivarta, Matsya, Vāyu and Padma have been relied upon and as to the rest of the Mahapurānas the Venkate śvara Press editions have been used (except in the case of the Nrasimhapurāpa of which the ṛdition of Messrs. Gopal Narayan & Co. and the Bhāgayatapurāns, of which the Nirnayasāgara edition of the bare text have been referred to). The Skandapurāna has been a source of great trouble and labour, Owing to the limited time at my disposal I have not been able to digest thoroughly the ninety thousand; and odd verses of that purāna, though I have very carefully gone into the Kāśikhanda and some other khandas. Besides, there are two separate recensions of the Skanda and large portions of it appear to be apocrypbal and later additions. The seven big sections of the Skanda viz Mabesvarakhanda, Vaiṣṇava, Brāhma, Kāśi, Ārantya, Nāgara, Prabhāsa are indicated by Roman figures from I to VI and the sub-sections by Arabic figures. Some of these sub-sections have further sub-divisions into Pūrvārdha and Uttarārdba, , , 

I have made endeavours to locate the tirthas as far as possible. Inscriptions have been drawn upon in several cases for locating the tirthas and for their antiquities and history. The principal Sanskrit authorities (except Kalbana) are often very Fague as compared with even foreign writers like Hiouen Thsang, Alberuni and Abul Fazal. Where I was not myself sure I have given references to the texts alone, and in some cases to the views of Cunningham, Dey, Pargiter and others If the same name happens to be given to different tirtbas located at different places, I have 'indicated the several different places bearing the same name by employing the capital letters 

726 

History of Dharmātāstra 

I Vol. A, B, C and so on. I may state that I have hardly ever remained content by borrowing references to Sanskrit authorities given by my predecessors, but have seen personally each reference to Sanskrit works except where I expressly state from whom I borrow a particular reference Sorensen's Index of the Mahābhārata and the Vedic Index of Macdonell and Keith have been used in several places I have also derived material help from the volumes of the Imperial Gazetteer and from the several volunies of the Bombay Gazetteer. The same may be said about Wilson's translation of Viṣṇupurāna (ed. by Hall, 1864-1877), Pargiter's notes to his translation of the Mārkan doyapurāva, Dr. B. C. Law's paper on the mountains and rivers of India' in the Journal of the Department of Letters, Calcutta University, vol. 28 and Dr. Hemchandra Raychaud buri's “Studies in Indian Antiquities' (1932), and the paper on 'Ancient towns and cities in Gujarat and Kathiawad' in I.A. TO). 54. I have consulted only a few Mābātuyas of tirthas, Recently, Prof. V. R. Ramchandra Dikshitar of Madras has published a useful work "The Purāṇa Index' (volumes I and II covering over 1400 pages) which collects material from five Purāṇas only viz. the Bhagavata, Brahmānda, Matsya, Vāyu and Vispu . The two volumes reach up to the Sanskrit letter 'ma' only. 1, 'for my part, do not agree with much that he says about the age of the Porānas in general and of the five Puranas (which he has digested) in particular, but this is not the place to go into that question Besides, his work has to be used with some caution, In several places the work is misleading. To take only a few examples. On p. 547 he lists 'Godhūma', makes the remark 

fit for sraddha' and cites four references from the Viṣṇuputada alone. One may prima face think that Godhūma is here some place fit for srāddha. As a matter of fact in all the references from the Vispupurāna "Godhūma' means 'wheat' and nothing more, which no doubt is fit food for śrāddha But other fit things such as 'iksu' (declared to be fit for sraddha by' Vāya 78. 7-8) are not inoluded at all. On p 123 Aśokavana is not a proper name, but only a forest of Asoka trees, as the preceding 

So also Karaala word 'drāksavana' (in Vāyu 38 68) indicates prabhava (not "prabhava' as printed on'p. 316 of vol. I) is not a river (in Matsya 163. 62, Ānandāśrama ed) but is only an adjective of the word Sopa that follows. On p. 316 of vol. II be states that the river Parā rises from Rsyayan, but the Matsya 114.24 on which he relies says it springs from Pariyabra, Oa 

the same page he gives the entry "Pārāvāratata sacred to

Mata'. This makes no sense. Pārāvāratata would mean 'the shore of the sea'. What is really meant is that Devi is styled or worshipped as Pārā on the bank of the Pārā river (Pārā Pārātate matā). He does not compare the readings of the several printed editions of the five purānas. Besides, the 

information furnished is very meagre. If the whole'had been * printed in a compact form far more information could have 

been given in the same number of pages. 

In some places I have indicated the rewards promised for bathing in the tirthas; but I have not done so in every case. The purānas promise one or Inore of the following rewards viz the same merit as the performance of Aśvamedha or Vājapeya or other solemn Vedic sacrifices or teaching the highest worlds such as those of Brahma, Viṣṇu or Śiva, the destruction of the gravest sins such as brāhmana murder, the same merit as arises frono gifts of a thousand cows &c. 

Many of the doubts and difficulties about the identification of several tirthas can, if at all, be solved only by means of actual journeys to various places and investigations on the spot. That is a task which would require for its proper accom 

plishment a team of workers. A single individual can hardly ' attempt such a task with his own resources. 

This list will, it is hoped, be of some use in elucidating. several problems such as the questions about the relative anti quity of the purānas, the dates of several Sanskrit works which mention'the tirthas and the questions about borrowing on the part of puradas among themselves and from the Mahābhārata.

three miles from Kodidar is sor Tounded by the ruins of a temple which popular Hindu belief declares to be tbe origraal Dvārabā, where Krmaresided and whence transferred bimself to Dvaraka ia Olhamandala. Vide Bombay Gazetteer, vol. VIII. (on Katbiawas) pp. 518-520 for Kodipar and p 552 for Mūla Dvāraka. It was founded by Krsna (with Rai. vataka as a park aod Gomanta as a bill) owing to constant invasions and harassmeat by Jarāsandba; it tras two yojanas long and one yojapa broad. Vide Sabhāparva 14. 49-55. The Vat. (149, 7-8) makes at 10 yoja pas long and 5 broad Vide p 688 above ander Matburā. B (14.54-56) says that the Vrsgis and Andbakas left Mathura through fear of Kalay avana, took counsel with Krṣna, ran to Kasasthali and built up Dvaraka: Vi v. 23. 13-15, B 196 13-15 say that Krsga begged 'of the ocean a strip of tsvelve yojanas, built Dvāraka with large parks, maasions aod strong walls and established the people of Mathura tbere. When Krsna passed away, the city was flooded by the sea and swept away, as stated in a prophetic veio by Mausala-parva 6.23-24 and 7. 41-42. B 210, 55 and 212.9. Vide also Vi. V.33 9 (the whole of Dvarakā except Krsna's palace was swept by the sca) and BV IV, 129,44 (except Rokoz ai's palace). It is called the capital of Aparta (Udyoga 7. 6) and was first called Kuśasthali (Sabhā 14. 50) Vide M 69,9=P. V. 23, 20, B, 7,29 32 and Ag 273, 12 (Kusastbalī being the earlier name of the capital). The present Dvārakż is near Olha 10 Kathiawar. The Harivansa II (Visu parva) chapters 58 and 98 deal with the founding of Dvāralā Some an. cient Jaia works like the Uttarādby. ayanasutra (SBE, vol. 45 p.115) men lion Dvārakā and Rairataka park 

(Girnat). -The Jātakas also refer to Dyāraka. Vide Dr. B C. Law's work on 'Iadia as described in early texts of Buddhism and Jainism' pp. 102,239. The Prabbasakbanda of the SK has A sab-section on Dvāraka in 44 chap. ters and over 2000 verses for the glorification of Dvārakā. It says the reward that is secured by (prigri mage to) Vārānasi, Kurolsetra and Narmadā can be secured at Dvārakā ja balf a triokle (4. 52)"; "Pilgri mage to Dvarala is the 4th means of mukti. Man secures mukti by acquiring correct knowledge about Brahman or by dying at Prayaga or by mere bath in Gomati near Krsna" (SK. VII, 4. 4. 97-98). The BV. (Krsnajanmalbanda, Uttarardha chap. 103) has a hyperbolical descrip tion of the creation of Dvārala, wbich is said to have been one hundred yojanas in extent. There is a work called Dvārakā-pattalaka compiled by Binabžyi (the only Ms, of which is the one at BOR I. in Poopa) wbich bas been published by Dr. J B. Chaudhurı (1940). The Ms is dated sandet 1574 (1518 A. D). It sommarises the Dvāraha mahatmya in SK. A pilgrim on reach iog Dvāralā first worships Gagesa, then Balarama and then Krsoa; ho visits Rukzgini's tercple on the 8th, 9th or 14th trthi, then visits Cabra tirtba, then Dvārabz Ganga, then Saglboddbāra, tben tathes in the Gomati. The temple of Dvāraka nātha is on the north bank of the Gomati creek. The main temple has five stories, is about 100 feet high from the ground and is sur mounted by a conical spire risiog to about 150 feet. Vide Dr. A. D.

CONCLUDING REMARKS ON TĪRTHAS 

At the end of this long list of tirthas a few words, as promised on p. 722 above, must be said about the attitude that we Indians of the 20th century should adopt towards the moun tains, rivers and other holy places in Bhārata. Modera secular education and the prevailing economic conditions, stresses and trends leave hardly any room for moral and spiritual uplift, We are surrounded on all sides by anxiety, want, misery, hardness of heart and crime. Therefore, the endeavour of all those who have the good of our country at heart must be to cherish all such institutions as tend to lift the mind out of Darrowness and to make it concentrate for some time at least on noble thoughts and aspirations and on detachment from tho all-engrossing pursuit of money, Pilgrimage is one of such institutions. Those who have faith in pilgrimages as enabling a pilgrim to attain heaven, to collect merit and reach release from samsāra should give pilgrimages a new orientation, should see that their charity is not wasted on indolent, ignor ant and vicious priests, should improve the methods of worship at holy places in such a way as will satisfy all hygienic requirements. The priestly class at holy places should romein ber that in the coming generations they are likely to find their occupation gone, unless they improve themselves, unless they try to be less ignorant and indolent than they aro at present and really serve as honest business agents or Travol lers' Guides The number of people visiting holy places in the belief of accumulating merit is sure to becomo less and loss, as modern secular education spreads. But it would be a calamity for the moral and spiritual greatness of India if pilgrimages to holy mountains and rivers came to be stopped altogether. I would very strongly recommend to all men, however highly educated, the undertaking of pilgrimages to certain hallowed spots. Our country has recently secured independence and it now rests entirely with us to make or mar the charnctor of the teeming millions of this our land. All things that tend to create in Indians the deep feeling that amidst diversitics of physical features, food, dress and habits, all of them are ono people, that there is no part or district of this past land which cannot claim to have made some substantial contribution in religious and philosophical thought, in abiding literature, in works of art and in holy places that the destinies of the Indians

Concluding remarks on tirthas 

827 

of one part of Bhārata are bound up with the destinies of all others. Frequent visits to distant places in Bhārata, mixing up among people of other parts and understanding their peculiar good points, needs and failings is absolutely necessary if we are to keep our freedom. India is thrice bjest in the mountain ranges of the Himalaya,which contains the highest peaks in the world and is full of large and life-giving rivers and of numerous shrines associated with the names of the greatest sages and heroes of antiquity. Every Indian who is proud of the great religious and spiritual heritage of our country must make it a point to devote some part of his time to frequenting holy mountains, rivers and other places of pilgrimage, When we see even from a distance the purity, the whiteness and the serenity of the snow-capped peaks of the Himalaya, the play of delicate and exquisite hues and tints of blue, mauve, and pink when the sun begins to shine on them, a sense of wonder, joy and elevation comes upon us, The glorious view of a peak like Kinchinjunga, which is an unforgettable experience, lifts up the whole life of the onlooker to a higher plane for long. Similarly, the sight of the holy Ganges at night or at sunrise in Haridvāra or on the majestic Ghats in Banaras surely empties our minds of meanness and for the moment at least fills our hearts with a sense of nature's beauty and with purity, and brings us in tune with the Infi nite, I may state here that the talk of the conquest of Everest in which some members of European expeditions indulge jars on my ears. This great peak has so far vanquished (physically) all those who attempted the conquest & But in a figurative sense Everest and other high peaks have been for ages conquer ing the hoarts of men. Even the members of these expeditions will admit that Everest and its brethren have drawn men to themselves from all parts of the world, made them give up their usual uneventful and placid activities, have evoked in tliose who attempt the climbing of these giants unbelievable courago, ondurance, resourcefulness and self-abnegation and have been instrumental in exhibiting to the world what un known powers the human spirit possesses. Therefore, these silent but awe-inspiring peaks should be looked upon as teachers of mankind and not as material things to be conquered and dealt with by human beings as they please
