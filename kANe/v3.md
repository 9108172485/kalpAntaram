PREFACE 

The second volume of the History of Dharmaśāstra was published in the third quarter of 1941. In the Preface to that volume I held forth hopes that the next volume dealing with the remaining subjects comprised in Dharmaśāstra might be placed before scholars in about three years thereafter. The Great War was then being fought in Europe and it was generally believed that India would remain free from the fear of actual invasion. But such fond hopes were shattered by the sudden attack on Pearl Harbour by Japanese bombers on 7th December 1941. Japan gained rapid and phenomenal victories and within about three months from the attack on Pearl Harbour vast territories from the Philippines to Burma fell into the hands of the victors. Calcutta and Trincomalee were bombed. Serious fears were entertained about an invasion of the mainland of India by land, sea and air. There was great panic in such coastal cities as Madras, Bombay and Karachi. The matters uppermost in the minds of Government officials and the members of the public were A. R. P. measures, the recruiting of men for the army, navy and air force and the removal of families and valuables to places of safety in the interior. Important and rare books froin the libraries of the Bombay Asiatic Society and of the Univer sity of Bombay were taken to distant places for reasons of security. During almost the whole of 1942 it was very difficult for me to work on the preparation of the third volume in the midst of a general atmosphere of panic caused by the fear of invasion and the removal of valuable reference books from Bombay. Owing to the war there has been great scarcity of paper and printing also has become very costly. I decided upon writing only on a few of the several subjects that remained to be dealt with and chose Rājadharma, Vyavahāra and Sadāoāra, the treatment of which is now placed before the public. Scarcity of paper and labour is responsible for the fact that this third volume has been in the press for nearly three years. The present volume increased in bulk beyond expectation. The fourth and last volume will deal with the following subjects: Pataka, karmavipāka and prāyascitta; antyeşti, aśauca and śrāddha ; tirtha; vrata; kāla and muhurta, śānti; Paurana dharma; the influence of the Pūrvamīmārsā and other gāstras on dharma sastra; the religious and philosophical background of dharma sāstra; the essentials of our culture, its future, the coming 

History of Dharnuatastra 

social and other trends and their impact on the dogmas and ideals of Dharmasastra, I am personally anxious to finish all the remaining work as early as possible. But looking to my age (I am nearly 67 now ), to my ailments and to the number of subjects that remain to be dealt with, it is impossible for me to say when the next and last volume may be published. This volume also is full of quotations, refers to many inscriptions, judicial decisions and legislative enactments. The reasons for this have been stated at length in the Preface to the second volume and I do not desire to repeat them here. In the general index to the second volume full references to works like the Manusmrti were not given, because such works were quoted on almost every page. But some critics found fault with this ; therefore in the index to this volume full references to all works are inserted. 

All that now remains is the pleasant duty of acknowledg ing my obligations to others. Bloomfield's Vedic Concordance, the Vedic Index of Professors Macdonell and Keith and several volumes of the Sacred Books of the East have been very useful in preparing this volume as in the case of the preceding one. I wish to mention specially the debt I owe to the late Maha mahopādhyāya Kamalakņşņa Smrtitirtha for his editorial work on twelve volumes on the different branches of dharmaśāstra, which have been of great use to me in writing all the volumes of my History viz. Hāralata, Vivā daratnākara, Gphastharatnā kara, Kộtyaratnākara, Tirthacintā maņi, Varşakriyākaumudi, Danakriyākaumudi, Sraddhakriyakaumudi, Suddhikaumudi, Dandaviveka, Rājadharmakaustubha and Agastyasamhita. I am highly obliged to Paramahamsa Svāmi Kovalānanda Sarasvati of Wai for frequent help and guidance in solving some intricate problems of Dharmaśāstra, to Prof. N. A. Gore, M. A. of Poona for help in the careful correction of proofs, to Tarkatirtha Raghunathasāstri Kokje of Lonavla and Mr. N. G. Chapekar, B. A., LL. B. (retired F.C. Sub-judge ), of Badlapur for reading through the whole volume and suggesting some additions and corrections. 

Assistance in various ways during the progress of the work for the last four years was very kindly rendered by a host of "friends and acquaintances, among whom I should like to make special mention of Prof. H. D. Velankar, Dr. R. N. Dandekar, Dr. S. K. Belvalkar, Rao Bahadur Prof. Rangaswami Aiyangar, Dr. A. 8. Altekar, Mr.P. K. Gode, Dr. Raghavan, Mr. S. N. Joshi of Bharata-itihasa-samsodhaka-mandala at Poona, Mr. Bhabatosh 

Preface 

Bhattacharya (son of M. M. Kamalakršņa Smộtitirtha ), Mr. S. L. Katre of Ujjain, Prof. A. M. Paramasivanandan of Pacchaiappa College at Madras, the late Pandit Rangacarya Raddi. Thanks are due to all these and many others for help and interest in this volume. It need not be expressly stated that I alone am responsible for the views and mistakes contained in this volume. I sincerely thank the Manager of the Aryabhushan Press, Poona, for carrying out the work of printing with care and promptitude in spite of difficulties caused by war conditions and paper and labour shortage. 

In a work bristling with thousands of quotations and references it is likely that many slips have escaped attention, The indulgence of the reader is sought for forgiveness in the matter of several misprints in the footnotes caused by loss or displacement of the parts of letters in the process of printing.

RĀJADHARMA 

( GOVERNMENT AND STATECRAFT) 

CHAPTER I 

Rajadharma has been a subject of discussion in works on dharmasastra from very ancient times. The Āp. Dh. S. II. 9.25.1 says "The general and special dharnus of all varnas have been explained: but now we shall declare the dharmas of a king in particular! Āp. then states that the king should cause to be built a capital and a palace, the gates of which both should face the south; that the palace should be in the heart of the capital; that in front of the capital there was to be a hall called 'aman trana' (hall of invitation); that to the south of the town there was to be an assembly house with doors on the north and south. Āp. requires that in the king's realm no brāhmaṇa should suffer hunger, sickness, cold or heat; Ap. gives regulations about the assembly house and about persons who were to be allowed to engage in gambling; he prescribes that the exercise in) arms, dancing, singing and music should not go on anywhere except in the houses of the king's servants, that the king was to see that there was no danger from thieves in villages and forests, that the king should donate fields and money to brāhmaṇas according to their worth without detriment to his servants, that the king who meets death in recovering the property of brāh mapas and other warlike persons who meet death in fighting for a similar worthy cause reap the merit of a sacrifice (i, e, reach heaven as reward); that the king should appoint in towns and Villages officers and their subordinates, who are pure and truth ful, for the protection of the subjects against thieves and who are to be made to make good what is stolen; that they are to collect lawful taxes for the king from the people except from learned brāhmaṇas, women of all castes, minors, students stay. ing with teachers and ascetics fulfilling the rules of their order, südras who do menial work for the higher castes (such as washing their feet), persons that are blind, deaf or dumb. Ap. then lays down punishments for adultery and rape, for slander and defamation, for manslaughter, for theft and appropriation of another's land, for breach of contract to cultivate the field of another, for a herdeman leaving his herd or negligently allowingHistory of Dharmasāstra

it to perish. He states that if the king does not punish the guilty he incurs sin, that in disputes judges should be men of learning, clever and fulfilling their duties, that witnesses were to tell the truth and were to be punished if they be untruthful. It will be noticed how Ap. briefly covers the whole field of rājam dharma. In the Sāntiparva of the Mahābhārata rājadharma is dealt with at great length in chapters 56-130 and to some extent in 131-17%. The Manusmrti also states at the beginning of chap. VII (1) that it will expound rājadharmas. That great literary activity on the science and art of government went on for many centuries before the Christian era follows from several considerations. The Anušāsanaparva (chap. 39.8) speaks of the śāstras composed by Bphaspati and Usanas. The Santi parva (58.1-3) names as expounders of rājašūstra Bphaspati, Bharadvāja, Gauraširas, Kavya, Mahendra, Manu Pracetasa and Visalākşa. Sāntiparva (102.31-32 ) opposes the view of Sambara to that of acāryas'. The Arthaśāstra of Kautilya mentions five schools (viz. those of the Mānavas, the Bārhaspatyas, the Ausa nasas, the Pārāsaras and the Ambhiyas), seven individual tea chers (V. 5, and I. 8) only once (viz. Bāhudantiputra, Dirgha Cārāyaṇa, Ghotamukha, Kaņinka Bhāradvāja, Kātyāyana, Kin jalka, Pigunaputra,) and several times mentions the views of Bhāradvāja, Kauņapadanta, Parāśara, Pisuna, Vātavyādhi, Viśālākşa. Kautilya also cites at least 53 times the views of acāryas, almost in every case for dissent. Sānti 103.44 refers to a Bhāsya on rājasāstra. Is it possible to see in this a reference to one out of the bhāsyakāras indicated in the verse appended at the end of the Kautiliya or to the Kauțiliya itself? Another fact indicative of the systematiza tion of the science of government is that in the Mahābhārata, the Rāmāyaṇa, Manu and Kautilya ideas expressed by numbers had already been stereotyped long before those works were written viz. such as saptāóga rājya (State with seven constituent elements ), şadguṇya (the six ways of policy viz. alliance, declaration of war &c.), three śaktis, the four upayas (sāma, dana, bheda, danda), astavarga, and pañcavarga (Manu VII. 155), the 18 and 15 tirthas (Sabhāparva 5.38).

Rajadharma 

about the Rājaśāstras of Bșhaspati, Ušanas, Bhāradvāja culled from the Mahabharata and other ancient works vide my paper on them in the Journal of the University of Bombay, vol. XI part 2 pp. 73-83, 1942. 

The fulfilment of their duties and responsibilities by rulers was of paramount importance to the stability and orderly develop ment of society and to the happiness of individuals in the State and therefore one often finds that rājadharma is said to be the root of or the quintessence of all dharmas. Santiparva (63.25) states * know that all dharmas are merged in rājadharma; that rajadharmas are at the head of all dharmas' and (141.9-10) * the welfare, good rains, sickness, calamities and death among people owe their origin to the king. It was the king's duty to see that the people in his kingdom acted according to the rules laid down in the smrtis for the several varnas and āsramas, to administer justice and to interfere when his help was sought for by a parişad ( assembly of learned men) in enforcing the prāyaścitla (penance ) prescribed for various lapses. Vide Gautama x. 7-8, XI. 9-11, Ap. Dh. S. II. 5. 10. 13-16', Vasistha 19. 1-2, Vispu III. 2-3, Narada (prakirnaka, 5-7 and 33-34), Santiparva 77.33 and 57.15, Matsyapurana 215.63, Markandeya purāņa 27.28 and 28.36 and H. Dh. vol. II. p. 965. Therefore it may be said with truth (as done by the Mahābhārata) that rājadharma was the highest goal of all the world, that it com prehended within itself all rules of ācāra, vyavahāra ( admini stration of justice) and prayascitta (penance). It is on account of this all-pervading influence of government or royal power that the Mahābhārata frequently emphasizes that the king is the maker of his age, that it is he who can usher a golden age or an age of strife and misery for the country'. The Sukranitisara (I.

[Vol. 

59-60 ) remarks that one should learn from sastra what are good and evil actions, give up evil deeds and perform good ones and that the king is hence declared to be the cause of (good or evil) times according as he does good or evil acts. Sukra IV.1, 60 states that the king is the prompter of his age. 

Though rājadharma was thus an integral part of dharma śāstra and was one of the most important subjects therein, yet apart from the works on dharmaśāstra separate treatises dealing with rājadharma alone came into existence in very early times. Santiparva (chap. 59 ) states that originally in the Krta age there was no king nor punishment, that then moha ( delusion), greed and lust entered men, that in order to provide against the complete destruction of dharma, Brahmā сomposed a work in one hundred thousand chapters on dharma, artha, kānia and mokşa (verses 30 and 79); that part of this work on Niti (science of government) was abridged by Sankara Vitālākşa (verse 80, and so it was called Vaigalaksa) into 10000 chapters, that Indra studied it and reduced it to 5000 chapters (and the work was called Bahudantaka, verse 83), that it was compressed into 3000 chapters by Bșhaspati (and so was called Bārhaspatya) and that Kāvya (Uśanas) reduced the work to 1000 chapters. The Kāmasútra (I. 5-8) contains a somewhat similar story that Prajāpati composed a work in one hundred thousand chapters, that Manu abridged it as regards dharma, Bṛhaspati as regards artha and Nandi abridged in 1000 chapters the science of erotics. The Sāntiparva (69) gives (verses 33-74) & summary of the contents of the work of Brahmā on rājadharma which remarkab ly agrees with the principal topics of the Kauţiliya. 

The Nitiprakāśikā (I. 21-22 ) states that Brahma, Maheśvara, Skanda, Indra, Prācetasa Manu, Brhaspati, Sukra, Bhāradvāja, Veda-Vyāsa, Gaurasirag were the expounders of Rājaśāstra, that Brahma composed a work on rājaśāstra in 100000 chapters, which was gradually reduced in size by each of the above mentioned founders until Gaurasiras reduced it to 500 chapters and Vyāsa to 300. The Sukranitisāra (I. 2-4) states that Brahma composed nitiśāstra in 100000 verses, which was subsequently abridged by Vasiştha and others (including Sukra). 

It is interesting to note the names given to the science of government. The most appropriate word is rājaśāstra' and it is employed by the Mahabharata, which speaks of Bphaspati, Bharadvāja and others as 'rājaśāstra-pranetāraḥ' (vide p.% above). The Nitiprakašika (I. 21-22) also dubs the divine and human

Rajadharma 

writers on government 'rājaśāstrāņām. pranetāraḥ.' The same word is employed by such ancient classical writers as Ašvaghoşa in his Buddhacarita (I. 46). The first verse in Prof. Edgerton's reconstructed Pañcatantra performs obeisance to Manu, Bṛhas pati, Sukra, Parāśara and his son and Canakya as the authors of nộpašāstra (science of kingship). Another name is Dandaniti. The Sāntiparva (59.78) explains why Dandaniti is so called viz. this world is led (on to the right path) by danda (the power of punishment, sanction) or this science carries (or sets forth) the rod of punishment; hence it is called dandaniti and it (faces) pervades the three worlds.' In śāntiparva 69.76 it is stated that 'Dandaniti controls the four varnas so as to lead them on to the performance of their duties and when it is employed by the ruler properly, it makes them desist from adharma.'? Santi 63. 28 identifies Dandaniti with rajadharmas. The Kauţiliya (I. 4) explains 'Dagda is the means of the stability and welfare of Anviksiki, Trayı (the three Vedas) and Vārtā; the rules that treat of danda are called dapdaniti, which is a means of acquiring what has not been acquired, which safeguards what is acquired, which increases what is guarded and distributes (increased wealth) among the deserv ing. The Mahābhārata says (Santi 69. 102 ) that a wise ksatriya, putting dandaniti in front, should always desire to acquire what is till then unacquired and should guard what is acquired. The Nitisāra (II. 15) says that dama (control or chastisement) is called danda, the king is called 'danda' because control is centered in him; that the niti (rules) of danda is called danda niti and niti is so called because it leads (people).'"* Sānti(69. 104) says that dandaniti is the special concern of the ksatriya (rājan). It is said in the Vanaparva 150. 32 that without Dapdaniti this

whole world would break all bounds. Vide also Śānti 15,29, 63.28, 69.74 ff (eulogy of Dandaniti). Dandaniti is said to be the support of the world (Sānti 121.24) and to have been produced by Devi Sarasvati (Santi 122.25.) 

Arthaśāstra has been a synonym for dapdaniti. When the Āp. Dh. S. II. 5.10.16 requires the king to appoint as purohita a brāhmaṇa well-versed in dharma and artha, it is clear that Apastamba has in view dharmaśāstra and arthaśāstra. The Anušāsanaparva says that Bphaspati and others composed artha sāstras (39.10-11). Dronaparva 6,1 speaks of a science of artha composed by Manu (Mānavī arthavidyā). Vide Jayagwal in 

Manu and Yājñavalkya' (pp. 5, 7, 16, 25, 26, 41, 42, 50, 84, for Manu and Artha). Sānti (71.14) states that a king whose sole concern is with arthaśāstra does not secure dharma and kāma and that all the wealth of such a king vanishes in ( the pursuit of ) improper objects. Vide Sānti 30%. 109 which speaks of artha sāstra as resorted to by the best among kings. The Rāmāyana (II. 100.14) states that Sudhanvā, Upādhyāya of Rāma, was an adept in arthaśāstra. The arthasāstra of Kautilya starts with the statement that it is the quintessence of all the arthagāstras composed by former teachers in the whole world and at the end Kautilya states that that sāstra which is a means of acquiring and guarding the earth is arthaśāstra. This mentions two of the four objects of dandaniti stated in the Kauţiliya itself (as shown in n.8 above). Only two objects are mentioned by Kautilya (as in Santi 69. 102 ) since they are the first and principal ones to be gained by the practice of the science of government. It is not meant that there was, as regards the topics to be dealt with, any diştinction between Dandaniti and Arthagāstra. The four objects mentioned by Kautilya are always placed before the kşatriya by Manu (VII. 99-100), śānti 102. 57 and 140.5, Yaj. I. 317, Nitisāra I. 18 ( while I. 8 mentions only two purposes of rājavidya). At the end (XV. 1) Kautilya states' artha is the sustenance of human beings, that is, the earth peopled by men That gāstra which is a means of acquiring and guarding that earth is arthasāstra.' Men derive their sustenance from the earth and all wealth also arises from the earth. Mr. Jayaswal ( Hindu Polity p. 5) is not right when he translates' Artha is human population.' Vide V. Ghoshal's 'Hindu Political Theories' p. 74 n and p. 76 for the various interpretations of this passage by Jayaswal and others. Authors a few centuries later than both the Mahabharata and the Kauţiliya treat the two as 

holds that the others. The Mitakse

identical. Daņdin in his Dasakumaracarita (VIII.) expressly says that Vişnugupta composed his work on dandaniti for the Maurya king in 6000 ślokas, though the Kautillya states at the very beginning that the work is an arthaśāstra. Dandin in the same context refers to 'Arthaśāstras as helping to polish the intellect' and speaks of some of the predecessors mentioned by Kautilya as writers on the śāstra (viz. the Arthaśāstra )." The Amarakośa treats the two as identical, 12 Medhatithi on Manu VII. 43 holds that the word 'Dandaniti' therein refers to the works of Canakya and others. The Mitāksarā or. Yāj. I. 313 paraphrases dandaniti by arthasāstra and on Yaj. I. 311 explains dandanīti as the lore useful in the acquisition and guarding of wealth (only the two objects mentioned by Kautilya in connec tion with arthasāstra ). According to the Sukranitisāra (IV. 3.56 ) 

that is said to be arthaśāstra in which instruction about the conduct of kings and the like is given without coming in. conflict with Sruti and Smộti and in which the acquisition of wealth with great skill is taught'. 

The words arthaśāstra and dandaniti are applied to the science of government from two different points of view. Artha is defined in the Kāmasutra (I. 20) as 'education, lands, gold, cattle, corn, domestic utensils and friends and the augmenting of what is acquired' (vide H. Dh. Vol. II part I. p. 9 note 22). Therefore when wealth and prosperity of all kinds is the spring and motive of giving a name the science treating of these is called arthaśāstra and when the government of the people and the punishment of offenders are the main ideas the same is called dapdaniti. Though works like Kautilya's Arthaśāstra place a high value on dharma they are principally concerned with the treatment of central and local government, taxation, the employment of sama and other upāyas, with alliances and wars, appointment of officers and punishment. Therefore Artha gāstra is mainly what is called drştartha smrti, as stated by the Bhavisyapurāņa (quoted by Aparārka p. 626, the Smộticandrikā p. 24, vyavahāra and Viramitrodaya, paribhāṣā p. 19). Medha tithi on Manu VII. 1 explains that dharma in that verse means

* duties' (dharmaśabdaḥ kartavyatāvacanaḥ), that the duties of the king are either drstārtha (i. e. the effects of which are worldly and visible) such as the employment of six gunas (sandhi, vigraha &c.) or adrstārtha (that have no visible effect but have a spiritual result) such as Agnihotra; here (in chap. VII-IX of Manu) the remarks relate principally to drstārtha matters since it is well-known that the word rājadharma is appli cable to such matters (the six guņas &c.) only.13 Medhatithi here declares that the rules of rājaniti are not based on the canonical books of dharmaśāstra but principally on the ex perience of worldly affairs. 

Another name for the science of government is Nitišāstra or Rajanitisāstra. Sānti" 59.74 says that in the nitiśāstra are set forth all those means whereby people are prevented from forsaking the right path. The Nitisara of Kamandaka's (I. 6) does obeisance to Vişnugupta who extracted the nectar of Niti gāstra from the vast ocean of Arthasāstra (works). The Pañca tantra p. 2 holds that Arthaśāstra and Nitiśāstra are synony mous. The Mitākşarā on Yāj. II. 21 remarks that the arthaśāstra referred to by Yāj. is rājanitiśāstra that is part and parcel of dharmasastra. The word 'rājaniti' occurs in Raghuvamsa 17.68. Vide Bhagavadgita X. 38, Aśramayāsikaparva 6.5, Manu VII. 177, Sānti 111, 73, 138,39, 43 and 196, 268,9 and Anusāsana 163.7 for Nitiśāstra meaning Arthaśāstra or Rājaniti and Drona 152,29 and Santi 37.9 for the word rājaniti. Another noteworthy word is 'naya' which means 'line of policy' and is employed by the Arthaśāstra (1.2) when it says'naya and anaya (bad policy) are treated of in Dandaniti'. It is also used in several classical works, such as the Kirātārjuniya (II. 3, 12, 54, XIII. 17). 

The relation of arthagāstra to dharmaśāstra has now to be understood. As stated above rājadharma is a very important subject of dharma-śāstra. Arthasāstra which is principally concerned with the rights, privileges and res ponsibilities of the ruler is therefore properly speaking a part of dharmaśāstra. As shown above it is supposed to have

Rajudharma 

like dharmaśāstra a divine source. But works on arthasāstra enter into great details about the government of a country in all its aspects, while dharmaśāstra works generally deal only with a few salient features of rājaśāstra. Just as the Kamasutra (I. 2. 14 ) states that dharma is the highest goal and kāma is the lowest of the three puruşārthas (vide H. Dh. vol. II part 1 p. 9), so Arthaśāstra also sets the highest value on dharma. The Kauțiliya states (III. 1. at end) 'In any matter where there is a conflict between dharmaśāstra and practices or between dharmaśāstra and any secular transaction, (the king ) should decide that matter by relying on dharma. If śāstra comes in conflict with any rational and equitable rule then the latter shall be the deciding factor and the (strict ) letter of the text will be nowhere'. But Kautilya and other writers on artha Bāstra lay the greatest emphasis on artha. In the eager and relentless pursuit of worldly prosperity means may be recommended or followed which may come in confict with the strictly ethical standpoint of the dictates of dharmaśāstra. In such cases of conflict dharmaśāstra works lay down (e. g. Ap. Dh. 1.9. 24. 23, Yaj. II. 21, Nārada, vyavahāramātrkā, chap. I 39 ) that dharmaśāstra rules are to be preferred to the dictates of arthasāstra. Visvarūpa (on Yāj. II. 21 ) states that according to some predecessors of his the conflict between the dictates of dharmaśāstra and arthaśāstra is illustrated as follows. Manu VII. 351 (which is the same as Vişnu-dharmasūtra V. 190 and Matsyapurāņa 227. 116-117 ) when dealing with vyavahāra ( a subject that pre-eminently belongs to arthaśāstra ) provides that in killing an ātalāyin, no fault attaches to the killer: while Manu XI. 89 in the chapter on prayascittas (which is pre eminently a topic of dharmaśāstra ) states that no penance is prescribed (i. e. there is no prāyaścitta for removing the guilt) when a person of set purpose kills a brāhmaṇa. The result is that the latter rule prevails and sin is incurred by killing a brāhmaṇa even if the latter be an atatāyin ( though there may be no punishment by the king ). Visvarūpa does not accept

this illustration. The Mitakşarā also refers to this example, disapproves of it and gives its own example. The Arthasāstra declares that a king should endeavour to secure friends, since the acquisition of friends is superior to the acquisition of gold and land ( as is laid down in Yāj. I. 352). The rule of dharma Gāstra is that a king has to dispense justice, being free from anger and avarice and in accordance with dharmaśāstra. There fore when a suit comes before a king he must decide it according to law, even though he may lose the friendship of a person if his decision goes against the latter. The Viramitrodaya follows the Mitākşarā. Dharmaśāstra went by the name of smrti (Manu II. 10), while arthasāstra was treated as an Upaveda. The Vişnupurāņa III. 6. 28, Vāyu 61.79 and Brahmānda 35. 88-89 mention the four Upavedas 1 viz. Ayurveda, Dhanurveda, Gandharvaveda and Arthasāstra as afiliated to the four Vedas respectively viz. Rgveda, Yajurveda, Sāmaveda and Atharvaveda. Kautilya (15) states that the king should listen to the recital of itihāsu in the latter part of the day and includes both dharmasastra and arthaśāstra under itibāsa' and requires the minister know ing arthaśāstra to advise the king (with examples and precepts derived) from itihāsa and purāņa. . Though Arthaśāstra is in theory for keeping to the path of dharma, one cannot blink one's eyes to the fact that the Maha bhārata and the Kauţiliya both support in several places the adoption of means entirely divorced from all rules of fair deal ing and morality. In Adiparva 140 we have a discourse by Kaņika said to have been a mantrin of Dhrtarāstra and a pro found student of Rājaśāstra, which is almost on the same lines as Santiparva chap. 140 where Bhişma sets out what lines of policy (niti ) should be followed by the ruler in adversity and how he should give up all thoughts of kindliness in such straits. He is supposed to give the substance of the dialogue between the sage Bhāradvāja and Satruntapa, king of Sauvira. The whole chapter is full of Machiavellian advice. A few speci mens may be set out here. One should be very courteous in speech, but like a razor at heart ( verse 13); one desirous of prosperity may fold one's hands, may take an oath, may use

sweet words, place his head on another's feet and even shed tears, one may carry on one's shoulders one's enemy till one accomplishes one's object and when a fit opportunity arises should break him like an earthen pot on a stone (17-18); the king should raise hopes promising their fulfilment at a distant day, but should put obstacles in the fulfilment of the hopes raised in others (32); when one is reduced to a wretched state one may extricate oneself from it by any act whatever whether gentle or horrible and practise dharma after one becomes able to do so (38); one should inspire confidence in one's enemy by some means which appear to be true ( to the enemy ), but one should strike him down at the right moment when he takes a wrong step (44); whoever causes obstacles to the purpose of the king, whether son or brother or father or friend, should be killed by the king who desires to prosper (47); without cutting the vitals of others, without committing horrible deeds and without killing indiscriminately as the fisherman in the case of fish one does not secure high prosperity (50); when about to strike one should utter sweet words and even after striking one should use honoyed words; even after severing another's head with a sword one should lament and shed tears (54); if some remainder is left in the case of a debt or fire or enemies, there is a tendency to grow and so no remainder should be left of these (58). It is to be noted that this chapter deals specially with what should be done in difficulties and can not be supposed to be the real teaching of the Mahābhārata which is generally in line with the higher code of dharma sastra. It embodied probably the words of earlier arthaśāstra writers like Bhāradvāja. After hearing this discourse on calculated cruelty and deceit Yudhisthira 'stood aghast and frankly told Bhisma that the course of conduct outlined by him did not differ from that of robbers and that he felt bewildered and would not exert himself in the way pointed out. In chap. 142 Bhisma replies to this by saying that he did not base his dis course merely on the sacred texts, but also on reason and the essence was distilled by wise men, that the considered rule of conduct for the king is twofold, viz. straightforward and crooked, that one should not ordinarily employ the crooked course of conduct, but should employ it as against an enemy who employs a crooked policy and effectively meet him by such policy. He further says that rājadharma cannot be based on a single source (v.7) and that policies are to be pursued not merely by reliance on the sacred codes of law but on reason as well12

[Vol. 

(v. 17 ) and that Indra himself has declared this rule which he derived from Bphaspati. In Sānti-parva a weak king is advised to harass a very powerful ruler's state by sword, fire and poison. In chap. 130 it is stated that the preservation of the state is the paramount consideration and that a king whose treasury is depleted and who is therefore in diffi culties may replenish his treasury even by harassing his subjects (except tāpasas and learned brāhmaṇas). In chap. 138 it is said that self-interest makes friends or foes and that aviśvāsa (putting trust in no one ) is the grand line of policy for kings. So it is clear that the Mahābhārata was prepared to give up in certain circumstances the strict rules of dharmaśāstra for kings and to allow them to pursue devious modes of action that were far from moral i. e. it tries to effect a synthesis of dharmaśāstra and arthaśāstra. 

The Kautillya also discloses how arthaśāstra writers did not shrink from giving advice which, to say the least, was most cruel, selfish and immoral. For example, in the section called ' guarding the prince'( Kauţ. I. 17 ) the views of several teachers are set out. Bhāradvāja says that princes are of the nature of crabs eating up their parent; so it is better to finish them in secret when they have no love for their father. Viśālākṣa abhorred this advice as cruel, as unsanctioned murder and as destructive of the seed of ksatriyas and recommended that it was better to keep them confined in a single spot. Vātavyādhi recommended that princes should be made addicted to sensual excesses. Kaut, disapproves of this as living death ( for the princes ), recommends proper care before conception and after birth and instruction in dharma. In Kaut V. 6 Bhāradvāja is quoted as saying that when the king is on his death-bed, the minister may set up the kinsmen of the king and the principal princes against one another, that whoever attacks should be killed by inciting the people against him, or having secretly punished the kinsmen and chief princes and brought them under control, the minister should himself take possession of the kingdom. Kautilya does not approve of this. But even he advises (XIV Aupanişadika ) the employment of poison, herbs and incantations against those who are irreligious or wicked. In I. 18 even Kaut, does not shrink from advising that secret emissaries ( of the reigning king ) may kill an abandoned prince with weapons and poison and in V, 1 Kaut. remarks that, when ā king cannot openly put down the principal courtiers or chiefs

who are dangerous to the kingdom, he may inflict punishment on them in secret or may induce the brother of the officer to be punished to attack the latter by promising to give him the posit ion and wealth of the officer and then destroy that attacker with weapons or poison saying that he was guilty of fratricide. In V.2 for replenishing a depleted treasury Kautilya coolly asks the king to deprive the temples in the kingdom of their wealth through the superintendent of religious endowments. 

Sanskrit literature on rājadharma is very extensive. Apart from the meagre materials contained in such ancient dharma sütras as that of Āpastamba, the following works deserve close study and have been utilized in this section; the Mahābhārata (Vanaparva 150, Sabhā 5, Udyoga 33-34, Sānti 1-130, Āśrama vāsika 5-7), the Rāmāyana (Ayodhyā, chap. 15, 67, 100; Yuddha 17-18, 63), Manusmrti VII-IX, Arthaśāstra of Kautilya ( which is the leading work on rājadharma), Yāj.

In recent times there is a deluge of works mostly inspired by the publication of the Kauţiliya dealing with ancient and medieval Indian polity in its various branches. The most important of these and a few other works independent of Kautilya are mentioned in the note below. 18 

19. Some parts of the Santiparva may be later than Kāmandaka's work, since santi ( 123. 11-12) refers to the dialogue of Kāmandaka and Angaristba king of Anga. But it need hardly be said that it is not absolutely necessary to hold that the extant Nitisāra of Kamandaka is referred to by sāntiparva.

In my treatment of rājadharma I have generally restricted myself to data derived from Sanskrit works on dharmaśāstra and arthasastra and have rarely ventured into works in Pāli. Similarly it has to be borne in mind that the works referred to cover a period of several centuries and further that In dia is not one country but a continent of wbich northern India formed one more or less homogeneous unit, while the Deccan formed another and South India formed a third unit. The institutions of these, particularly of the last of the three differ in many particolars from those of the other two. But the authentic data furnished by South India aro later by centuries than thoso supplied by the north and besides are comparatively meagre. Therefore in this work one has to confine oneself principally to Sanskrit works composed in North India or the Deccan.

proposed is to indicate and dilate upon only the fundamental ideas and principles of the several matters falling under rāja dharma. Nor is it possible to enter here into formal and lengthy refutations of the several views propounded by Western and Indian writers about the forms and functions of Government and the state of society in ancient India. Most of the modern works referred to in note 19 above are more or less based on the same material in Sanskrit and Pāli, but the emotional or subjec tive element is different in each case. Some western writers have without very solid foundations iudulged in a facile and sweeping generalization that the great Empires of antiquity such as those of the Assyrians, the Babylonians, the Medians and Persians and the Indians were mainly tax-gathering insti tutions (vide Sir Henry Maine's 'Early History of Institutions' 1875, pp. 384 and 390; and Prof. Rangaswami Aiyangar's 'Ancient Indian Polity' 1935, pp. 5-6 and pp. 66-69 (where passages from T. H. Green and others are cited); while some Indian writers vehemently assert that the Government in An cient India was always some form of limited monarchy. Both characterisations are in my opinion misleading. An endeavour will be made to present from the original texts as true a picture of the polity of ancient and medieval India as it is possible for me to do. It will do no good to label the ancient institutions of India with concepts and terms current in the West during the last one hundred and fifty years or so. Even in the West true democra cies or real democratic governments did not exist and the masses in no country had elective popular assemblies or councils before the last quarter of the 18th century. Such assemblies do not exist even now in several countries of Europe. Even in the ancient Greek city states the number of slaves who had no voice in the government was several times as large as the free citizens and those states were no democracies at all in the strict sense. 198 Indian polity has a recorded history of over two thousand years from at least the 4th century B. C. Its growth was gradual but its aims and ideals and its main elements have been the same throughout the centuries. India need not feel ashamed or fear

Berolzheimer in 'the World's Legal Philosophies' (tr. by Jastrow, New York, 1929) p. 62 remarks ‘Plato approved of slavery unreservedly, finding it & necessary condition for the maintenance of the proper status of the citizen.... Thus in the maritime and industrial states there was a large slave class; in Corinth, 460000; Aegina, 470000; la Attica (according to the consus of 309 B, C.) 400000',

a comparison of its ideals and theories of State with the ideals and theories of western countries in ancient and medieval times. If western countries could boast of so-called republics and city states in ancient Greece and Rome, India also had several re publics in ancient times. The ancient Hindus made their own contributions to political thought, though unfortunately Western scholars of the 19th century like Max Müller, Weber and Roth were concerned most with the Vedic and allied literature and either did not know or ignored the vast literature on politics contained in Sanskrit and Pali works. Vide 'Some Aspects of ancient Hindu Polity' by Prof. D. R. Bhandarkar (1929) pp. 2-3 for views of Max Müller and others and criticism thereof, also Dr. Beni Prasad's “Theory of Government &c.' P. I, U. Ghoshal History of Hindu Political Theories' pp. 3-4. 

CHAPTER II. 

SEVEN ANGAS OF RAJYA 

According to almost all of our authorities a state (rūjya) is constituted by seven elements 20 viz. svāmin (ruler or sovereign), amütya (minister), janapada or rāştra (the territory of the State and its people), durga ( fortified city or capital), koša ( accumula ted wealth in the ruler's treasury), dandu (army), mitra (friends or allies). These seven are called angas or praktis. The word praksti in works on politics is also used for the constituents of a circle of states (of a mandala). Vide Manu VII. 156 and Kau tilya (VI.2). The word also means ministers as in Sukranitisāra II. 70-73 and 'subjects' in Khāravela's Inscription (E. I. vol. 20 p.79 1. 4), Nārada (prakīrṇaka 5), Raghuvamsa VIII. 18. The order in which these are arranged and their names vary a good deal. The quotations given below will indicate how the order differs. The sequence is important for the reason that some of our authorities expressly state that when calamities be fall or deterioration sets in each of the seven elements, those that befall each preceding one are more serious for the State than those of each succeeding one ( Kautilya VIII. 1, Manu IX. 295). For janapada sometimes the word jana or rāştra is used, for * danda' the word 'bala' and the word 'pura' for 'durga'. The Aśramavāsiparva (5.8) speaks of eight angas of rājya. Accord ing to Sumantu quoted by the Sarasvativilāsa (p. 46 ) danda means “punishment bodily or monetary” and' army is included under ‘kośa'. Sumantu says that th esvūmin has to be preserved by himself, the ministers by showing them proper respect, the people by keeping them contented, the fortified capital by abun dance of wealth and grain, the koša by proper expenditure, danda

History of Dharmafāstra 

(Vol. by following one's dharma, friends by truthfulness. The autho rities are agreed that the ruler is the most important or the first of the seven. Kautilya puts the matter very forcibly and realis. tically when he states that the briefest exposition of the elements of rājya is to say that the king is the State S). This is really not the same doctrine as that emphasized by Louis XIV of France when he said ' L'Etat c'est moi'. Kautilya makes his position clear (in VIII, 1) by saying that it is the king who appoints ministers and servants and superintendents, who takes measures of relief against calamities befalling the other prakstis and measures of prosperity, that it is he who appoints other ministers when those already appointed are under calamities, that if the ruler is pros perous he transmits prosperity to his prakstis, that the prakstis bear that character which the king has and that hence the ruler occupies the position of a permanent, never-exhausted centre of power. The Sukranitisāra II4 remarks that if the king begins to act at his sweet will, it leads to calamities, to loss of ministers and of the kingdom. The Sukranitisāra (I. 61-62) compares the seven angās of rājya to the organs of the body viz., the king is the head, the ministers are the eyes, ally the ear, treasury the mouth, the army the mind, capital and rāştra are hands and feet. It is emphasized by Kām. (IV.1-2) that each of the seven elements is complementary to the others, that if the state is defective even in one out of the seven elements it does not pull well. thel Sāntiparva it is stated that it is not possible to say categorically that any one of the seven excels the others in merit, but that at different times a different element assumes importance over others, since that particular element is in the particular circumstances capable of accomplishing the purpose in hand. This shows that Manu and the Mahābhārata held that there was an organic unity in the several elements of rājya. All must work harmoniously towards one ideal or end. Manu (IX. 296–297) says this by means of a simile 'Just as among the three staves tied together (by a rope of cow's hair) used by a sannyāsin no particular staff is superior (to the others ), so among

the seven elements of the state no particular one can be said to excel the others, since each of them has a particular excellence of its own; a particular element is pre-eminent in some particular matter and therefore the superiority of one to the others when expressed (as e. g. in Manu IX. 295 ) is to be confinod to that matter alone.' Manu here emphasizes the harmonious working or unity of the seven elements though they are diverse in their individual characters. The analysis of the elements and nature of the State led ancient Indian writers to hold that a mere conglomeration of people did not by itself constitute a State, but that for a State there must be people who live within certain definite geographical limits (rāstra ), they must be bound by the bond to render allegiance to a ruler ( svāmi), have a certain system of government (amātya), inust have a regulated economic system, a force for defence and international relationships. That is, the most essential elements of a state are (1) a sovereign, (2) a system of govern ment, (3) a definite territory and (4) & population of some size. These four were known even to the most ancient sūtras. Vide Gaut. XI. 1 (rāja), Ap. II. 6. 25. 10 (amātya), Ap. II. 10. 25. 11, 

II, 10, 26. 4 (visaya, nagara, grāma), Gaut XI. 5-8 (prajā). 

These seven elements will now be dealt with one after another. 

It should be noted that neither Kautilya nor Kamandaka defines rājya. Etymologically it means the 'karma' or 'bhāva' ( activity or state of a king )', being derived from 'rājan' with the affix 'ya'(syan or' yak', acc. to Pāṇini V. 1. 124 and 128 ). This is the etymological meaning. But rājya ' is employed in the sense of 'kingdom' in popular parlance and also in the smrtis and works on polity as in Manu VII. 111, Kim, XIII. 81-82, But when it is said that rājya 'has seven elements then ' rājya 'has a very wide meaning and stands for the king, the ministers, the country and its people and the economic and military resources and in such a case it is proper to translate the word as 'the State'(as including both the Government and the governed). In some cases rājya' should be rendered as * government, which includes only the king and his ministers and conveys also in modern times the agency or machinery through which the will of the State is formulated, realized or carried out; vide Mānasollāsa II. 8, verses 688,689, 691 The Nitivākyāmsta (p: 43 ) says " rājya means the activity of the ruler that would be appropriate to protecting the earth". 

20 

History of Dharmasastra 

[Vol. 

Medhatithi on Manu VIII. 1 remarks that rājya means 'a prosperous people'. In XIII. 4 Kautilya states (na hyajano janapado rājyam janapadam vī bhavatili Kautilyah) it as his opinion that a territory without any inhabitants cannot become a rājya (a kingdom ) or a janapada (as one of the seven elemento). Sabara on Jai. II. 3. 3 has a discourse on the deri vation of rājya. 

Prof. Bhandarkar in 'Some Aspects of Ancient Indian Polity' (pp. 66-89), Jayaswal in Hindu Polity' part II p. 9, Prof. B. K. Sarkar in ‘Positive Background of Hindu Sociology' Book II pp. 34-39 and others maintain that this ancient analysis of rājya into seven elements shows that the idea of the State as an organism, that is, the organic theory of the State was known to Hindu thinkers and that this doctrine of saptanga rājya 1a satisfies the definition of the State given by Bluntschli and others. On the other hand Mr. Anjaria in chapter IV of his 'Nature and grounds of political obligation in the Hindu state' after pointing out how there are different versions of the organic theory of the state denies vehemently that the Hindu theory can be called a proper organic theory of the State, particularly because the Hindu thinkers did not regard the State as a moral organism, because they attached a permanent stigma of inferiority to large sections of the community on the bare ground of birth and that the Hindu conceptions did not harmonize the authority of the State and the liberty of the individual. It would be far beyond the scope of the present work to enter into any discussion of this problem. All that may be said is that Mr. Anjaria tilts the balance to the other side too much. The faults he points out in the Hindu theory and practice beset almost all theories of the State almost in all countries. Even in the times of Plato and Aristotle huge popula tions of slaves had no voice in the affairs of the state. Up to the 19th century true democracies never existed oven in Europe. 

The Ruler--The necessity of a ruler is forcibly emphasized in several works. The Ait. Br. I. 14 says that the gods thought they were worsted because they had no king, that therefore they elected one by consent. This shows that military necessities 

. 218. Korkunov in General Theory of Law' (tr. by W. G. Hastings, New York, 1922) says 'Bluntschli' assimilates government to the head, as it is the head of the State, the ministry of the ioterior to the ears, and that of foreign affairs to the pose' (p. 274). 

DI] 

Matsyanyaya led to kingship. Manu VII. 3 ( =śukranitisāra I. 71 ) says the Creator created the king for the protection of all this world when everything ran through fear bither and thither, as there was then no ruler in the world'. It goes on to say that the Creator proceeded to create Daņda (the power of punishment ) for the sake of the king and that if the king does not sedulously employ danda for punishing those that deserve it, the strong would torment the weak as fish are fried on a pike or as in water fish devour each other (Manu VII. 14 and 20, the last also showing a variant 'jale' for 'śūle'). This idea of mātsyanyaya ( the maxim of the larger fish devouring the smaller ones or the strong despoiling the weak) is frequently dwelt upon by Kautilya, the Mahābhārata and other works. It can be traced back to the Satapatha-brāhmaṇa XI. 1. 6. 24. whenever there is drought, then the stronger seizes upon the weaker, for the waters are the law ', which appears to mean that when there is no rain, the reign of law comes to an end and mātsyanyāya begins to operate. Kautilya says “if danda be not employed, it gives rise to the condition of mūtsyanyāya, since in the absence of a chastiser the strong devour the weak' and 'the people overwhelmed by the operation of mātsyanyāya made Manu Vaivasvata their king.' 83 That in the absence of a king (urājaka ) or when there is no fear of punishment, the condi tion of mātsyanyāya follows is declared by several works such as the Rāmāyana II. chap. 67, Santiparva 15. 30 and 67. 16, Kāmandaka II. 40, Matsyapurāna 225.9, Mānasollāsa II. 20 verse 1295. Numerous works contain eulogies of daņda. The king is called dandadhara in many works e.g, in Santiparva 67.16 and Kām. I. 1. Gautama XI. 28 says that the word danda is derived by the wise from the root' dam '(to control ), that he (the king ) should control by means of danda those who observe no restraint and (XI. 31 ) that the instructions of the teacher and the power of punishment(wielded by the king) guard those who violate the rules of varņas and aśramas.

Danda rules over all people, it protects all of them, danda is awake even when ( the guardians of law ) have gone to sleep, the wise regard danda as dharma ( Manu VII. 18=Sānti 15.2 = Matsya 225. 14-15). The whole world is under the heel of daņda, for it is difficult to find a man who is pure by nature (Manu VII. 22 = Sānti 15. 34). The conception of danda is therefore this that the State's will and coercive power keep the indivi dual and nation within the bounds of dharma, punish for breaches and effect the good of the whole. The gods, dānavas, gandharvas, the rākşasas and reptiles -- these also tend to bring about enjoyment for men because they are pressed down by danda (Manu VII. 23 ). The Bhagavadgitā (X. 38) identifies danda with the divine Kroņa 'I am danda in the hands of those who control others, I am niti ( i. e. rājaniti ) for the conquerors'. For the detailed effects and long eulogies of danda, vide Manu VII. 14-31, Matsya 225. 4-17, Kāmandaka II: 38-44. These eulogies of danda presuppose the theory that people obey law and the dictates of the śāstra through the fear of force or punishment. Danda should be neither too severe nor too mild, but should be appropriate to the fault committed (Kaut. I. 4, Kāmandaka II, 37, Manu VII. 16, Santi 15. 1ff Santi 56. 21, 103. 34). Sānti 57. 41 advises that one should first secure a king, then wife and then wealth, for in the absence of the ruler there would be no wife nor private property. * This shows that the institutions of family and private property and the protection of the weak are bound up with the existence of a fuler. Kātyāyana (in Raja N. P. p. 30 ) says the king is the

protector of the helpless, the home of the homeless, the son of the sonless and the father of the fatherless. 

In order to magnify the importance of the kingly office, certain works state that the king has in him parts of the gods. For example, Manu says "the Creator created the king with the essential parts taken from Indra, the Wind god, Yama, the Sun, Agni, Varuna, the Moon and Kubera the lord of wealth and therefore he surpasses all beings by his majesty (VII. 4-5 and compare Manu V. 96 ); one should not disrespect a boy-king with the thought he is a human being ( like others )' for it is a great deity that stands ( before people) in human form as a king" (Manu VII. 8=Santi 68.40). This conception goes back to Gautama XI. 32 ( Therefore a king and a spiritual teacher must not be reviled') and Ap. Dh. S. I. 11. 31. 5 (' he shall not speak harsh or abusive words of the gods or of the king'). Manu VII. 3-4 are the same as Sukranitisāra 1.71-72. The Matsyapurāņa 226. 1 states that the king was created by Brahmā by taking portions of gods for wielding the power of punishment for the protection of all beings. Manu ( IX. 303-311 ) puts forward a slightly diluted theory, viz, the king should possess the majesty of and imitate in his actions the first seven deities enumerated above with the Earth as the 8th and Manu sets out what the eight characteristic actions are. Matsya 226. 9-12 are the same as Manu IX. 303-306. The Agnipurāṇa ( 226. 17-20 ) states that as the king exercises the functions of nine deities viz. the Sun, the Moon, Vāyu, Yama, Varupa, Fire, Kubera, the Earth and Vispu he has the form of these. Vide Sukranitisāra I. 73-79 for similar ideas. These verses do not amount to the express theory of divine origin, but assimilate by analogy the king's functions to those of certain deities. The Nārada-smrti (prakirnaka section, verses 20-31 ) contains 27 several interesting dicta. It says that in the form of the king it is really Indra himself who moves about on the earth (v. 20 ), that a king even when devoid of qualities deserves honour from the people, that kings exercise the functions of five deities viz. of Agni, Indra, Soma, Yama

and Kubera (vv. 26-31). The Mārkandeyapurāna (27. 21-26 ) mentions the same five deities. "The Veda says that when a king is chosen it is Indra himself that is chosen; one desirous of prosperity should honour the king just as one worships Indra'-says Sānti 67, 4. Sānti 69 states that all the gods are invisible, but the king is a deity that can be seen. The Vāyu purana (57. 72 ) remarks 28 that in all past and futuro manvantaras universal emperors ( cakravartin) are born on the earth with parts of Vişņu. The Matsyapurāņa (226. 1–12 ) mixes up the theory of the creation of the king from parts of the gods with the lesser idea of his functions being similar to those of certain deities. The Bhagavata-purāņa (IV. 14. 26-27) states that Vişnu, Brahmā, Siva, Indra, Vāyu, Varuņa -- these and other gods-exist in the body of the king and that the king is full of (the parts of ) all gods. It is to strengthen this con ception that ancient kşatriya dynasties and their panegyrists tried to trace for those dynasties descent from the Sun or the Moon and in later times from Fire. The practice of addressing the king as 'deva' in Sanskrit dramas is due to the same tendency of the glorification of the royal office. Asoka was styled 'devānām priya' (beloved of the gods ) and Kushana emperors like Kanişka and Huviska styled themselves Devaputra (E. I. vol. I. pp. 371 at pp. 381 and 386). This phenomenon is not confined to India. Alexander the Great and Julius Cæsar had their descent traced to gods and goddesses. Alexander was deified during his life-time in 324 B. C. by the Greek world (vide Cambridge Ancient History, vol. VI. p. 433 ) and Cæsar's image was carried among those of the immortal gods. Kautilya (I. 13 ) makes a spy say among pauras and jānapadas 'kings are (in) the place of (perform the functions of) Indra and Yama, since they visibly inflict punishment and bestow favours. Even divine punishment affects those who despise them ( kings ). Therefore kings should not be despised'. Hence it must be said that the conception of the divine nature of the kingly office was well-known in Kautilya's days and he was not above recommending the employment of this conception for safe guarding the king's position. Vide Rāmāyana, III. 1. 18-19 and VII. 76. 37-45 and Mārkandeyapurana 24. 23-28, Vişnudharmot tara IL 2. 9 for similar ideas. The phrase 'nā vişnuḥ prthivipatih'

Divine character of kingship 

is well-known and may be interpreted in two ways viz. the Tuler of the earth is Vişņu incarnated as man or no king is not Vişnu i. e. every king is Vişnu. The Pancatantra * (I. 120 p. 19) statos · Manu has declared that the king is made up (of parts) of all gods! The Rājanstiprakāśa is careful to point out that the idea of the king having in him parts of the deities applied only to the mahārāja ( the sovereign ruler), while the idea of a ruler doing the functions of five deities applies to vassal kings. 20 For eulogy of the kingly office, vide Manu VII. 6–17, śānti 63, 24-30, Sānti 68, Kām. I. 9-11, Rājanltiprakāśa pp. 17-31. 

But it should not be supposed that this glorification of the king resulted in the full-fledged theory of the divine right of kings or that every king, however bad, was looked upon as a divinity or could do what he liked. In the first place, the Rāja. nitiratnākara 31 (p. 83 ) when speaking of the coronation of a prince by his abdicating royal father quotes a verse where the peuple (prajā) themselves are called Vişnu. In the second place the king's authority over brāhmaṇas was limited ( vide H. Dh. vol. II. part 1 pp. 139-140). The Gautama-dharmasūtra ( XI. 1,7 and 8) says 3 'the king rules over all, except over brāhmaṇas; all, except brāhmanas, should while sitting low on the ground wait upon ( worship ) him ( the king ) who occupies a high seati they (the brāhmaṇas ) too should honour him'. From the time of the Ait. Br. (37.5) the harmony between the king and the brāhmaṇas and the king's following the advice of brāhmanas had been insisted upon. Vide Ait. Br. 40. 1, Gaut. VIII. 1. XI. 27. Further the Sukranitisāra (1 70) states that a king who oppresses the subjects and causes loss of dharma is made up of the parts of rūkşasas. 33 Manu (VII. 111-112 ) states that

the king who harasses his subjects loses his life, family and kingdom. Moreover stories of kings killed for their tyranny are found in the ancient Literature. For example, Vena, who was jealous of the gods, wanted sacrificial offerings to be made to himself (and not to the gods ) and violated dharma, was killed by the brāhmaṇas ( Sāntiparva 59. 93-95, Bhagavata purāna IV. 14). The Anušāsanaparva 34 ( 61. 32-33 ) solemnly sanctions the killing of a king in certain circumstances " The people should gird themselves up and kill a cruel king who does not protect his subjects, who extracts taxes and simply robs them of their wealth, who gives no lead. Such a king is Kali (evil and strife ) incarnate. That king who after declaring 'I shall protect you' does not protect his subjects should be killed (by the people ) after forming a confederacy, like a dog that is afflicted with madness". Manu (VII. 27-28) states that the great principle of danda if properly wielded conduces to the advancement of the three puruşārthas, but if a voluptuous, mean and unjust king wields it, it recoils on his head and destroys the king together with his relations. Kām. 2. 38 makes it clear that danda foolishly wielded might exasperate even hermits. The Santiparva 92. 19 recommends that a king who has false and very wicked ministers and who puts down dharma should be killed by the people. Even as early as the Tai. S. II. 3. 1 it appears that kings were driven away, while the Satapatha Brāhmaṇa ( XII. 9. 3. 1 and 3) mentions a king Dustaritu Paumsāyana who had been expelled from the kingdom which had descended to him through ten ancestors. The Sautrāmaņi işti is prescribed as a rite for a king to regain a kingdom from which he had been driven away (vide H. Dh. vol. II. p. 1227). Sānti 92. 6 and 9, Manu VII. 27 and 34, Yāj. I. 356 appear to justify at least deposing a king, if not tyrannicide. Similarly, the Sukranitisāra ( II. 274-275 ) states as that a king, though of a noble pedigree, should be abandoned, if he violates dharma, if he hates good qualities ( in others ), lines of policy and the army and if his conduct would lead to the destruction of the kingdom and that the family priest with the consent of the principal

King's liabilities 

officers of state should place on the throne another scion of the royal family who is possessed of the requisite virtues. Nārada props up the theory of divine right by stating that the king secures dominion over (lit. purchases ) his subjects by his austerities ( performed in former lives) and therefore the king is their lord ( prakirņaka 25). Sukraniti I. 20 also brings in the doctrine of Karma ' the king holds the earth by the actions of his former lives and by his austerities.' Compare Manu VII. 111-112, Sānti 78. 36. The Sukranltisāra (IV. 7. 332-333 ) says that brāhmanas may even fight and destroy an oppressive ksatriya king and would thereby incur no sin. The Yasastilaka ( HII. p. 431 ) gives examples of kings killed by their subjects, one being a Kalinga king who made a barber his commander-in chief. In fact in all works on polity we find coinparatively little about the king's rights and special privileges, but on the other hand the greatest emphasis is laid on the king's duties and responsibilities. Some works describe the king as a servant of the people whose wages or remuneration for the protection he affords is the taxes he raises. Vide Baud. Dh. 8. I. 10. 1, Sukraniti I. 188, Nārada (prakırņaka 48), Sānti 71. 10.36 It may be said here that the apparently inconsistent dicta about the divinity of the king and about his being liable to be deposed or even killed for evil deeds are delivered from two different standpoints and are addressed to different persons. The writers believed in maintaining the status quo about the duties of varṇas and asramas, in the privileges of the respective castes and in the progressive deterioration of dharma in the ages to come and wanted a strong king to preserve the social order; therefore the king was raised to divinity and absolute obedience to his orders was demanded. This was addressed to the people in general. There was danger however of bad kings and ministers oppressing the people by misrule. Hence the king and his ministers were threatened with destruction and death. These dicta were principally meant for the king and his advisers. 

In the Kauçiliya V. 3 we meet with these words “In Rajasūya and other solemn (or elaborate ) sacrifices the "rājn' gets three times the salary given to others who are as learned as he is" (samānavidyebhyas-triguņavetano rājā rājasūyādişu

(Vol. 

kratuşu ). Jayaswal (in 'Hindu Polity' part II. p. 136 ) seices upon this passage to show that the king was a salaried person like the prime minister or the commander-in-chief. The words * in Rajasūya and other kratus' should have raised doubts in his mind about his interpretation, but he entirely missed the significance of the passage. Kautilya in that passage is not referring to the king himself but to his representative or deputy when the king is engaged in numerous ceremonial duties during sacrifices of long duration like the Asvamedha. The Ap. Srautasútra (XX. 3. 1-2), Baudhāyana Srauta XV. 4, Satyāsādha Sr. XIV. 1. 24-25 state that the adhvaryu priest was to deputize for the king when the latter was engaged in the Aśvamedha 37 ( which was spread over a period of about two years). The salary referred to by Kautilya is to be paid to the adhvaryu when representing the king. Vide H. Dh. vol. II. p. 1232 for this. In X. 3 it is said by Kautilya that a virtuous king on the eve of a battle should urge on his soldiers the fact I am a wage-earner like yourselves, this kingdom is to be enjoyed by me along with you. You have to strike down the enemy pointed out by me". 88 Here the theory of the king being a wage-earner or a servant of the State is em. phasized in a striking manner, 

The word 'rājan' is derived in the Nirukta (II. 3) from the root 'rāj' to shine, but the Mahābhārata (Santi 59, 125 ) likes to say that the king is styled “rājā' since he keeps all people contented, that is, it derives the word 'rājan' from the root 'ranj'. Great poets like Kalidasa (Raghu IV. 12) follow the Mahābhārata in this, as also in deriving the word ‘ksatriya' from "kşata' and the root 'trai', meaning one who protects from wound and injury (Śānti 59. 126 and Raghu-vamsa II. 53). Br. quoted in the Rāja. Dh. K. (I. p. 5) appears to derive the word both from 'rāj' and 'rañj' (balena caturangeņa yato rañjayati prajaḥ 1 dipyamānaḥ sa vapuşā tena rājābhidhsyate). 

There are in our authorities germs of several theories about the origin of kingship. Rg. X. 173 (which corresponds to

Origin of kingship 

29 

Atharvaveda VI. 87 and 88.1-2) has been taken as an election hymn by some writers (0.8. Jayaswal in 'Hindu polity' p. 7). But one is constrained to say that it is probably nothing of the kind. The only words that may lend some colour to the theory of election are ' let all the people desire thee (as king)' in Rs. X. 173, 1, but those words may apply as a benediction even in the case of one who is already a king. In the Atharva veda III. 4. 2 there *' is a reference to the election of a king by the people the people (višah) chose thee to govern the kingdom, these quarters, the five goddesses (chose thee)'. In Atharvavada III. 5, 6 and 7 also there is a faint allusion to the election of a king by nobles, king-makers, sūtas and headmen of villages, by the clever makers of chariots and the skilled workers in metals. These 'king-makers' are called 'ratnins' in other Vedic texts and the Tai. Br. I. 7.3 states in connection with the twelve offerings in the Rājasūya called 'ratninām havimşi' that the 

ratnins' give the (rāştra) kingdom (to the king). Vide H. Dh. vol. II. p. 1215 n 2648 and p. 1216 for the 'ratnins'. So it appears that the conception was that the king got the kingdom from nobles, high functionaries and the common people. For the coronation bath (and its implications) mentioned in the Ait. Br. vide note 105 below. The Ayodhyākānda (chap. 1 and 2) describes how Dasaratha when he grew old desired to make his eldest son Rāma the Crown Prince (yuvarāja), how he called together an assembly of vassal kings, citizens and rural inhabi tants and placed before the assembly his idea, how they acclaimed loudly the old emperor's proposal and readily gave their consent. This shows that though kingship became hereditary in course of time some element of popular approval was sought for. But such passages referring to the approval of the people cannot be stretched to mean that the king was chosen by a parliament the members of which were elected by the people. All that happened appears to have been only this that citizens that approved assembled spontaneously and expressed their feelings in the assembly. In the Rāmāyaṇa II. 67. 2 it is said that when Dasam ratha died sages like Mārkandeya and Vāmadeva declared along with the amatyas in the presence of the family priest (purohita) Vasiştha that as Rama and Lakşmana had gone into exile and Bharata and Satrughna were in the Kekaya country, some scion

of the Ikşvāku race should be chosen as king. These sages and ministers are spoken of as king-makers ('rāja-kartārab') here and in chap. 79. 1. In the Adiparva 44. 6 it is stated that all the citizens of the capital in one voice elected Janamejaya, though a boy, as a king on the death of Parikşit and Janamejaga ruled with the help of his ministers and purohita. There are histo rical examples of the election of kings. The kşatrapa Rudradā man was elected king by the people of Surāştra (who at one time formed a republic, acc. to Kautilya XI. 1) and he took an oath as stated in his Junagadh inscription in the year 72 (150 A. D.). *0 Vide E. I Vol. VIII p. 36 at p. 40. Gopāla, the founder of the Pāla dynasty of Bengal (730-740 A. D.), was elected a king (E. I. Vol. IV, p. 243 at p. 248 and Jayaswal's History of India,' 150-350 A. D. pp. 44-45). It appears that it was the business of the chief ministers and brāhmaṇas to propose some body as king and such persons were called 'rājakartāral'. In Ayodhyā 67. 8 they say 'our country is without a ruler and may therefore encounter disaster'. Arājaka does not necessarily mean in Ayodhyā 67 anarchy but a condition in which there is no king nor ruler. Though this is so, it is not possible to agree with Mr. K. P, Jayaswal ('Hindu Polity', part I, pp. 97-98, 134, 173) that'arājaka' was 'an idealistic constitution, that it was an extreme democracy almost Tolstoian in ideal, that it was based on a legal and communal basis, that it was a case of extreme individualism in which government itself was regarded as an evil.' Ayodhya 67. 8-31, Adi, 41. 27 ff., Santi 67. 3 ff., Matsyapurāņa 225. 8-9 are the principal passages on arājaka. A perusal of these will convince any one not carried away by the over-patriotic desire to find the latest European thought in our ancient books that arājaka was viewed as a state of chaos and the negation of any constitution; that when a country was without a ruler, no private property in anything existed or was respected and people preyed upon each other like fishes (Ayo dhyā 67, 31) and that no Tolstoian ideals were present before the eyes of the writers that drew such a harrowing picture of a State without a ruler. The famous Chinese traveller Hiouen Thsang notices (vide Beal's Buddhist Records of the Western World, 1884, vol. I. pp. 210-216) that when Rajyavardhana was

treacherously murdered by king Saśānka, the great minister Bhandin (who was also a cousin of Harsa) called an assembly of ministers and made to the young Harşavardhana a proposal to assume the royal authority, which proposal was backed up by all the ministers and magistrates, that thereupon Harşa agreed to become king after consulting the oracle of Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva. After the death of Parameśvaravarman II (of the Pallava dynasty), when the Pallava kingdom was subject to anarchy, the subjects chose a king. For the details of this elec tion, vide the important constitutional document of the Vai kuntha Perumal temple (Dr. C. Minakshi's 'Administration and Social life under the Pallavas', 1938, p. 38). The Rājatarangipi narrates (V. 461-463) that Yasaskara who was originally a poor man was chosen as king by the brāhmaṇas. 

In some other places a theory somewhat like the theory of social contract expounded by Rousseau is adumbrated. The theory of social contract is presented in modern times under two forms. In one there is supposed to be a tacit or explicit agreement between the Government and the people. In the 2nd form it is supposed that a political society was constituted by a compact among individuals (to which the ruler was not a party). This theory puts forward the notion that government depended on the consent of the people. Kautilya (I. 13) refers to the legend that Manu Vaivasvata was made a king by the people, who agreed to assign one-sixth of the grain raised by them ag the king's share in return for the protection afforded by him. But Kautilya is silent as to whether Manu made any promise to the people. Sāntiparva, chap. 59, states how Vainya, the first king, was called upon by the gods and sages to take an oath and how he promised them that he would protect the world, and would carry out his duties as laid down in the science of govern ment and not act at his sweet will." When this theory of an agreement between the king who took an oath and the people spread among the people, the theory of the divine right of kings, if ever seriously held, would recede more and more into the back-ground. Vide Dr. Beni Prasad's 'Theory of Government in Ancient India'chap. VIII and 'Pro-Buddhist India' (1939) by Mr. R. N. Mehta, chap. II pp. 79 ff. and 101 for election of

kings and for Buddhist theories of government. It is not possi ble to hold as Jayaswal, U. Ghosal and others do (e. g. 'Manu and Yajnavalkya' II, 'Hindu Polity' part II pp. 54-57) that the theory of social contract was the earlier one and that the theory of divine right of kings was later on propounded by the Manu smrti to support the brāhmana empire of Puşyamitra. Jaya swal is wrong in saying (in 'Hindu Polity' part II p. 57) 'the theory of the Mānava was never approved or adopted by a single subsequent law-book'. It has been shown above that Nārada and others espoused the same theory. Manu himself eulogises the supreme power of daņda over the king himself (Manu VII. 28). He makes use of both the theories as occasion demands. 

The germ of the theory of Divine Right of kings probably goes back even to the Rgveda. Rg. IV. 42 is a hymn of king Tragadasyu, son of Purukutsa. Some of the ideas therein are startling enough. He says 'the gods rely on the might of Varuņa, while I am the lord of the people (verse 1, krutum sacante Varunasya devā rājāmi krsteh &c); I am Indra and Varuņa, I am the wide and the deep Heaven and Earth, I am the son of Aditi (verses 3 and 4)'. Here there is an explicit claim by a king to be identical with the mightiest and greatest gods of the Vedic pantheon. In the Atharvaveda VI. 87.1-2 it is said about the king ‘May all the people long for you, may not the kingdom be lost from your hands, may you stand firm in the world like Indra and may you uphold the kingdom'. In the Satapatha Brāhmaṇa V. 1. 5. 14 (when describing the shooting of arrows in the Vājapeya) it is said 'the rājanya is most manifestly of Prajāpati, while being one he rules over many'. Here the posi tion of the rājanya appears to be regarded as due to his being the representative of Prajāpati. In the Sat. Br. V. 4. 3. 4 the sacrificer in the Rājasūya is identified with Indra and it is said that that position is due to two causes viz. (1) his being a member of the kşatriya order and (2) his participating in a solemn sacrifice. But passages like the last and Sat. Br. V. 1. 3. 4, V. 1. 4. 2, V. 2. 2. 14 should not be relied upon in support of the theory of the divine right of kings (as done by U. Ghoshal in * Hindu Political Theories', pp. 28-29), since every participator (whether a brāhmaṇa or a kşatriya) in such solemn sacrifices as the Agnistoma and Vājapeya was supposed to possess a celes tial body after dikşā and Pravargya and was often spoken of as identified with Indra and other gods. Visvarüpa on Yāj. I. 350 quotes a long vedic passage (agama) in which it is stated "tho gods said to Prajapati 'we shall arrange for a king in fiuman

form by taking from the moon, the sun, Indra, Vişnu, Vaiśra vapa (Kubera) and Yama respectively majesty, brilliance, valour, victoriousness, liberality and control" and that the king thus formed asked the gods to give to him Dharma as his friend and that then he would protect the people and then the gods made Dharma (i. e. danda) his friend. 

We may examine the theories of the origin of kingship in the Mahābhārata. The śāntiparva deals with this subject in two places, in chap. 59 and 67. In chap. 59 Yudhişthira asks the great warrior and statesman Bhişma how the title 'king' arose and how one man, who has fundamentally the same physical and mental equipment as other men, rules over all men. These are not really two questions but only two aspects of the same question. Then Bhisma starts by saying that there was originally a state of perfection (Kṛtayuga) in which there was no king, no kingdom, no punishment and no chastiser. Gradually moha (delusion or aberration of mind) spread among people and then greed, sexual desire and passions arose and the Vedas and dharma perished. The gods did not receive offerings and went to Brahma, who composed a vast treatise as stated above (p. 4 ) that dealt with the four goals of existence for the benefit of the world and that was the cream of learning. Then the gods went to Vişnu and requested him to appoint (as king) one who deserved to be the best among men. Vişņu created a son from his mind called Virajas who did not want to be a king. Fifth in descent from Virajas was Vena who destroyed dharma and so the brāhmaṇas killed him and from his right arm they churned Pșthu, handsome, well-armed and proficient in the Vedas, Vedāngas and Daņdaniti. Gods and sages asked him to follow settled dharma, to control his senses and to take an oath (set out above in note 41). He was crowned by the gods and sages for the protection of the people. Vispu himself esta blished him saying 'Oh king, no man will go contrary to your order' and then Vianu entered the king Pșthu (verse 128) and it is therefore that this world since then bows to kings as to gods. In this account the oath administered to Přthu was so administered by the gods and sages and not by the people in the mags, nor does Pfthu expressly promise anything to the people as such. Probably it was thought that the promise to the sages was impliedly a promise to the people in general. But the account, such as it is, rather appears to emphasize the divine origin of kingship.

History of Dharmaśāstra 

( Vol. 

Chap. 67 contains a much shorter version of the origin of kingship, probably because a few chapters before another vers ion has already been given or because it embodies the views of some prior work or teacher. It begins by saying that the most desirable thing for a State is to crown a king, that in a kinglese country there is no dharma, no security of life nor of property, that therefore the gods appointed kings for protecting people. Then it proceeds to say that the people assembled and made compacts ( sumuyān) amongst themselves that whoever would commit libel or assault or adultery and break the compacts made by the people should be abandoned. All people went to Brahmā and requested him to appoint a ruler whom they would all honour and who would protect them. Brahmā appointed Manu for that purpose, but Manu did not at first like the idea, saying 'Govern ment is a very difficult business among men who are always deceitful and I am afraid of the sinful acts of men'. The people asked him not to be afraid as the sing committed by men will affect the perpetrators (and not Manu) and that the people would give him shares of produce (one-tenth of grain, one-fifth of cattle, one-fourth of their dharma &c.). Manu then agreed, went round the world, terrorizing evil-doers and making them conform to dharma. This story about Manu and the people is alluded to by Kautilya (vide p. 31 above). Even here Manu promises nothing expressly, while the people agree to pay taxes and answer for their own sins. There is no doubt that some of the details in the two chapters are different. In chap. 67 there is no reference to an original state of perfection nor to a yast work nor to any oath; so also in one it is Vainya who becomes the first king and in the other it is Manu. But the conception in both is mythological and the fundamental fact in both is the same. God gives a king to the people in both, when they were without a king and degeneracy had set in. Though there is no offer to give a share in chap. 59 yet it is to be inferred from the matijñā of Vainya that every subsequent king was deemed to do the same. It may be said that in chap. 67 there is a blending of the theory of Divine Right and of an original compact between king and people. In both, however, the emphasis is on the theory of the divine origin of kingship. Santi 67. & states *one desirous of prosperity should honour the king as one, honours Indra', while chap. 59, 139 asks "what is the cause but the divine character (the king possesses) on account of which people remain under his control'? It must be said that in both 

II) 

Origin of kingship 

35 

chapters of the Sāntiparva there is no proper theory of contract between king and people. 

The Nāradasmrti as indicated above (pp. 23,27 and note 27) is a thorough-going advocate of the theory of divine right. It says (prakirņaka 20-22 ) It is Indra himself who moves about on the earth as king; people can nowhere live after transgressing his orders. Since the privilege of protection is his because of his supreme power (inajesty ) and on account of the fact that he is benign to all creatures, the settled rule is that whatever a king does is right. Just as the husband, though weak, must be honoured by the wife, so a ruler though devoid of qualities must be honoured by his subjects'. Verse 25 inculcates the duty of obedience to the king. 

According to Mr. J. N. Figgis in his book The divine right of kings' (1934) pp. 5–6, the theory of the Divine Right of kings in its completest form involved the following propositions : (I) monarchy is a divinely ordained institution; (II) hereditary right is indefeasible i. e. the right acquired by birth and descend ing by the law of primogeniture cannot be forfeited through any acts of usurpation, or by any incapacity of the heirs or by any act of deposition; (III) kings are accountable to God alone, i.e. a limited monarchy is a contradiction in terms; (IV) non resistance and passive obedience are enjoined by God i. e. in any circumstances resistance to the king is a sin and leads to damnation and that when the king issues a command directly contrary to God's law, the latter is to be obeyed and also all penalties attached to the breach of the king's law are to be patiently borne. This theory was very much to the fore in the 16th and 17th centuries when in Europe theology and politics were in close union. 

It is to be seen how far the ancient Hindu theory agreed with this full-fledged theory of the divine right of kings. As regards proposition I it has been shown above that the Manusmrti, the Mahābhārata and other works held that the king was either God himself, or god's vicar or vicegerent performing functions similar to those of several gods. As regards proposi tion II all Sanskrit works recognised hereditary right and primogeniture, but they allowed exceptions as will be shown later on. Our ancient books did not accept the third and the fourth propositions in toto. They say that the king cannot do as he likes, that he has to carry out the diotates of dharma, his

power to make new rules is limited and if he does not act up to the rules of dharma he may be deposed, disobeyed or killed. Vide quotations from Sukraniti and Anušāsanaparva cited above. When Manu (VII. 111-112) says that a king who harasses his kingdom loses his life, his family and his kingdom, it is implied that people are not bound to suffer silently all the wrongs heaped upon them by a bad king but that they may turn round and either depose him or kill him. Fick (pp. 103-104) gives examples from the Buddhist Jatakas where bad kings were killed by the people and others were elected in their place. There is no doubt that obedience to the king is enjoined by Nārada and others, but it is due to the king only so long as he does not swerve from the path of right and virtue. Nārada * (prakirņaka verses 12 and 32 ) says 'on account of his majesty and sanctity a king and brāhmana are not to be abused if they do not swerve from the right path; one should not treat with contempt or scold the king, one should abide by his order, since (the penalty of) death may follow from violating it (king's order )'. Here the duty of obedience is not based on the divine origin of kingship, but on the practical wordly ground that an offended king may punish with death. Nārada's doctrine does not lead to the requirement of absolute submission and non-resistance to a wicked king. 

It is impossible to hold that the theory of divine right was put forward as a counterblast to the theory of social contract. The theory of divine right would arise very naturally even in the oldest days, while the theory of social contract is the product of a more advanced stage of political thought. The theory of divine right is not more absurd than the theory of social con tract and was popularly hold not only in India, but in many Christian countries, relying on passages in the Bible such as Daniel 4 and Romans 13, 1-7. The theory of divine right was circumscribed in India by another theory from very ancient times. The cry of the American colonists against England in the 18th century was that taxation and representation went hand in hand ; that of the ancient Hindu political and dharmaśāstra writers was that taxation and protection went hand in hand (see n. 45). Baud. Dh. S. I. 10. 1. says the king being hired for the sixth

part ( that he takes as tax) should protect the subjects'. Yaj. I. 337 states The king shares half of that evil which the subu jects do when not protected by the king, since he takes taxes (from the people)' and Yaj. I. 334 lays down that a king who proteots according to śāstras receives the 6th part of the merit (punya) of the subjects. Sāntiparva (57. 44-45) states 'One should abandon six persons like a leaking boat in the ocean vis. a teacher who does not explain, a priest who does not study the Veda, a king who does not protect &c.' Sukraniti I. 121 affirms 'the gods destroy a king who does not protect, a brāhmaṇa who does not perform austerities, a wealthy man who makes no gifts, Vide Vasiştha I. 44-46, Gaut. XI. 11, Vişnu Dh. 8. III. 28, Udyoga parva 132. 12, śānti 67. 27 ( 4th part of pupya), Santi 24. 12 ( 4th part), Santi 72. 20, Aśramavāsi 3.40, Anušāsana 61.34 and 36, Kām. II. 10 for the idea that the king receives a part (generally 6th part) of the punya (and also sin) of the people. The king had to protect even forest hermits who paid no taxes, as he would share in their punya 48. Vide Rāmāyaṇa III. 6. 14. Kālidāsa echoes this in the Sakuntala II. 13. Adiparva 213.9 looks upon the king who takes the sixth part as tax and affords no protection as the arch-sinner in the world. Sānti 71.29 says that the spiritual merit that a king gathers by protection according to the sacred code yields rewards for him in heaven for ten thousand years. 

From the preceding pages it is clear that the following are put forward as the grounds on which the obligation to render obedience to the ruler is based: (1) the king has divinity in him, (2) the great utility of the ruler affording protection as regards life, liberty and property, (3) the fear of punishment (Manu VII. 22), (4) a primeval contract between the ruler and the people, (5) the interdependence of the ruler and the people as parts of one organism (viz, the State). Vide Medhātithi on Manu IX. 294 for this last. 

Who should be king? There were several views on this point. One meaning of the word 'rājan' is ‘ksatriya', Manu (VII. 1) states that he will declare rājadharmas and in the very next verse he employs the word “ksatriya' and remarks that a ksatriya who has undergone the upanayana sarskāra (or abhiseka according to some commentators) should afford protection to all in his kingdom. Therefore a ksatriya is the most proper person

to be a king. Some of the works such as the Rajadharma-kaus tubha, Rājanitiprakāśa, the Nitimayükha, and Par, M. vol. I. pp. 449-451 refer to the discussion in the Pūrvamimānsā works on the topic of the Avesti sacrifice. On Jaimini II. 3.3 Sabara and Kumārila hold an elaborate discussion. The Vedio texts say "rājā rājasūyena yajeta' ('the Rājasūya should be performed by a rajan'). Among the numerous constituents of that sacrifice there is an işti called Aveşti, with reference to which a vedic passage says 'if a brāhmaṇa performs avesti. he places the āhuti (offering) for Bphaspati in the middle, if a ksatriya performs it the offering to Indra is placed in the middle of the offerings &c.'. The pūrvapakşa (prima facie view) is that the word 'rājan' applies to any one (whether a brāhmaṇa, a kşatriya or a vaisya) who protects the people. The siddhanta (the established conclusion) is that in this text the word rājan means a kşatriya and that by the other passage about brah maņas &o, what is meant is that brāhmaṇas and vaisyas may independently perform the Aveşti sacrifice, but that only a ksatriya can perform the Aveşti as part of the Rājasūya rites. Sabara makes the interesting remark that in the Andhra country the word 'rājan' is applied to a man of the ksatriya caste even though he does not pursue the occupation of protecting a country or a city; while Kumārila observes that persons of all the four varpas are seen as rulers of kingdoms. ** In the literature on dharmaśāstra the word 'rājan' is understood in the sense of one whoʻrules over or protects a country' (i. e. the pārvapakşa view 

in the Pūrvamīmānsā). Vide Medhātithi on Manu VII. 1. Aparārka"s (on Yāj. I. 366) remarks "when he who is not a kşatriya performs the work of a kşatriya (i. e. becomes a king) he should do all this ( that a ksatriya king has to do) since the maxim is 

that by assuming the position or the work of a particular person or thing one receives what is due to that other' and the

duty of protecting the subjects arises from the fact of taking taxes from them. For everyone when giving wealth doos 80 with reference to a purpose related to himself and there is no purpose except one's protection that is intended in rendering taxes. Hence it is established that whoever receives taxes must secure protection of the subjects". According to Kullūka the word 'rājan' means 'any person who is crowned king and pro tects the country and capital' and is not used in the sense of a person of the kşatriya caste'. The Rājanitiratnakara (p. 2) after citing Kullūka and Kamadhenu states that many hold that "rājan' means any one who takes upon himself the task of protecting the subjects'. The Rājanitiprakāśa holds a long discussion (pp. 10-15), states that the word 'rājan'may have three meanings viz. any one who protects people, a kşatriya in general or a ksatriya who is crowned and ultimately gives it as its opinion that the word 'rājan' is applied in popular usage to any one, whether crowned as king or not, who is the ruler of a country. The Vaijayanti on Vişnu Dh. S. III. 44 explaing *rājāām' as 'of kşatriyas' by following the Aveşti māxim. 

Several brāhmaṇa families founded kingdoms and empires. Pusyamitra, founder of the Sunga empire, was a brāhmaṇa (Harivamsa III. %. 35 ff, E. I. vol. 20 p. 54 ); the Kāņvāyanas, who followed the Sungas, were brāhmaṇas and so were the Vākātakas, the Kadambas (vide Talagunda pillar Inscription of Kakusthavarman in E. I. vol. VIII. p. 24) and several others. Vide H. Dh. vol. II. pp. 122–123 for texts on the question as to when a brāhmaṇa should follow the profession of arms. Manu XI. 100 states that a brāhmaṇa who knows the Veda deserves to be made a king, a commander-in-chief, the wielder of the power of punishment. Kumārila's dictum that persons of all varnas are seen to be rulers has been already quoted. Gopāla the founder of the Pāla dynastry of Bengal was a sūdra. Manu IV, 61 directs a brāhniana not to stay in a country where the ruler was a sūdra. Medhātithio explains this by saying

that the prohibition applies only to a country where all the seven high functionaries such as the chief minister, the commander in-chief are of the sūdra caste; compare Ap. Dh. 8. I. 11. 32. 18. Manu's dictum related to a time when there was hardly any südra king. But the logic of facts was too much for Medhātithi who had to twist the plain words of Manu. Medhātithi on Manu VIII. 1 remarks that persons of other varnas who subsist by the mode prescribed for ksatriyas have power over the kingdom and have to protect the people'. Santiparva remarks that whoever protects people from the hordes of dasyus and wields the power of punishment according to smrti rules must be considered as king. The Harivamsa (III. 3. 6 *akşatriyāśca rājāno viprāḥ sūdropajivinah') and some of the Purāņas in depicting the awful degeneracy of the Kali age in a prophetic strain state that the kings in the Kali age will be mostly sūdras and that sūdra kings will celebrate Aśvamedha sacrifices. Vide, for example, Matsya 144.40 and 43 and Linga purīna 40.7 and 42. Hiouen Thsang notices that in the first half of the 7th century A. D. Sind was under a sūdra king ( Beal's B. R. W. W. vol. II. p. 272 ). 

It was almost a universal rule that a male alone was to be the ruler. There appear to have been stray exceptions. The Santiparva ( 33.43-46 ) enjoins " upon a conqueror the duty to place on the throne of a conquered country the brother, son or grandson of the vanquished king and if no prince be available, then to crown even the daughter of the late king. The Raja tarangini (V. 249 and VI. 332) describes at great length the regime of the notorious queens Sugandhā (904-906 A. D.) and Diddā ( 980-81 A. D.) of Kashmir, In India for many centuries there has been no Salic Law expressly declaring that daughters cannot inherit land, though on account of the general position of women, the requirements of disturbed times and military necessity women did not generally assume the role of sovereigns. In a copper-plate grant from Ganjam (of about the 13th century) it is stated that when a certain king named Subhākara died his queen ascended the throne and after her her daughter Dandi mahadevi, who is styled parama-bhattarika-mahārājā dhiraja paramešvari' ruled the earth for a long time ( E. I. vol. VI p. 133 at p. 138). Whether the grandiloquent titles were deserved by the queen or were only the exaggerated effusions of a courtier,

Women as rulers 

it is clear that the widow and daughter of the last male ruler succeeded to the throne. The Raghuvamsa (XIX. 55, 57 ) states that the widowed queen of king Agnivarna sat on the throne and carried on the government with the help of hereditary ministers. 

Apart from conquest and election in rare cases, monarchy was hereditary and generally descended by primogeniture. The passage from the Satapatha Brāhmaṇa (XII. 9.3, 1 and 3) mentioning the descent of kingship for ten generations in succession has already been referred to (p. 26). Though succession was hereditary it was the general rule that the eldest son ascended the throne when the reigning monarch died or abdicated. The rights of the eldest son or daughter as against the younger son or daughter were very jealously guarded in the vedic age. It has already been shown how marrying before one's elder brother or sister was condemned in the vedio age and also in the times of the smộtis (H. Dh. II. pp. 546-549). Even the Rgveda several times refers to jyaişthya (rights of seniority) of Indra (Rg. 1.5.6, TII. 50.3). The Tai. S. II. 2.11.5 states that the gods agreed to treat Indra as the "jyestha' (the eldest) and Tai. S. II. ** 5.2.7 refers to the ancient practice of giving all wealth (of the father) to the eldest son, The Ait. Br. 19,4 narrates the story that the gods did not accept Indra's position as the oldest and most exalted among them and that Indra then induced Bphaspati to perform the Dvādaśāha sacrifice for him, whereby he secured that position. The Nirukta II. 10 sets out the interesting story that Devāpi and Santanu were two brothers, scions of the Kuru family, of whom Devāpi was the eldest, but Santanu the younger one got himself crowned king and so Devāpi practised austeri ties. The result was that there was a drought in Santanu's kingdom for 12 years. The brāhmaṇas said to him "You are guilty of having violated dharma in that passing over the eldest brother you got yourself crowned. Therefore God does not send down rain'. Then Santanu desired to give the kingdom to Devāpi, who however said that he would be his purohita and make him perform a sacrifice. The Rgveda hymn X, 98 was then composed by Devāpi for bringing down rain. This story shows how long before Yāska the popular belief was that it was a great sin to

pass over an elder brother in marriage and other matters and doing so brought down the serious displeasure of the gods. Vide Brhad-devatā. VII. 156-157 and VII. 1-9 for the same story in a little greater detail, viz. that Devāpi suffered from a skin disease, that when Devāpi said to the subjects that he did not deserve the kingdom and that Santanu should be their king, the subjects crowned Santanu as king. When Yayati desired to pass over his elder sons Yadu and others because they disobeyed him and wanted to make the younger Pūru his successor the brāhmaṇas and citizens protested “How can the younger son secure the kingdom passing over the elder one 80'? Arjuna upbraids Bhimasena who got enraged against Yudhisthira * who would act against one's eldest brother that follows the path of dharma?' (Sabhā 68.8). In the Rāmāyaṇa 51 Dasaratha addresses Rāma (II. 3.40 ) ' you are born of my eldest queen, who is of the same class as myself (i. e. of ksatriya blood)' and Vasiştha says to Rāma 'Among all Ikşvākus the eldest son becomes the king'; a younger brother is not crowned king when the elder exists' (II. 110.36 ). The Ayodhyākā da in Beveral places (8.23-24, 101.2 ) reiterates the idea that all the song of a king do not succeed but only the eldest, although the other sons may be equally fit and endowed with qualities. Kautilya (I. 17) 52 states that people esteem rulership going to the eldest except in the case of some calamity. Manu IX, 106 says that by the very birth of the eldest son, a man becomes free from the debt he owes to his pitts and there fore the eldest deserves to get everything from the father. The Rajadharma-k. ( pp. 234-235 ) after quoting the Kālikāpurāpa and the Rāmāyana lays down the following propositions:(1) the aurasa son of a king alone succeeds in preference to the eleven kinds of secondary sons (whether he is junior or senior in age); (2) if the son of a junior queen ( of the same caste ) is senior by birth, he succeeds in preference to the son of the senior queen,

who (son) is younger in age; (3) if two sons are born to two queens at the same moment, the son of the senior queen is preferred ; (4) if twins are born to the senior queen, the son who is born first is to be preferred. 

If the eldest son suffers from a physical or mental defect (such as blindness or lunacy) he is to be passed over and his younger brother becomes king (vide Manu IX, 201 for grounds of exclusion from inheritance). Adiparva $3 109. 25 states that Dhstarāstra because he was blind did not succeed to the kingdom, Vide also Udyoga 147, 39. The Sukranitisāra (1. 343-344) states that if the eldest prince suffers from deafness, dumbness, blindness, leprosy or impotence he is unfit to rule and that in such a case his younger brother or son should succeed. The Sukranitisāra further points out that by dividing a kingdom among the several princes no benefit results, but on the contrary the small parts would fall an easy prey to enemies; therefore when the eldest alone succeeds he should make his younger brothers provincial governors or superintendents over the trea sury, horses &c. (I. 346-348). The Rājadharmakaustubha lays down a few additional propositions: (1) even if the eldest does not succeed owing to some mental or physical defect, his son's right will remain intact and R. D. K. quotes the words of the fisherman chief to Bhisma in Ādi. 100. 92.55 The Bālambhatti on Yāj. I. 309 and Rājanitiprakāśa p. 40 say the same. Another example is that of Anšumān who became king when his father Asamañja was exiled from the state by Sagara for his misdeeds. (2) When a younger son is crowned king because the eldest is disqualified, then after the former's death his son succeeds and not the son of the disqualified eldest son who is born after the coronation of the younger (e. g. Yudhisthira deserved the kingdom on Pandu's death and not Duryodhana ). The Nitivā. kyāmrta ( sec. 24 p. 249) lays down the order of succession in the case of kings as follows: the son, full brother, half-brother, uncle, a nale of the same family, daughter's son, a stranger (who is either elected or who takes up the kingdom 56).

History of Dharmaśāstra 

[ Vol. 

Sometimes a king selected a younger son to succeed him, There are famous historical examples. The great Gupta Emperor Samudragupta though a younger son was nominated by his father Chandragupta I to succeed and by his brilliant and most successful career Samudragupta more than justified the choice. Vide the Allahabad Pillar Inscription verse 4 (Gupta Inscrip tions p. 6). Similarly Chandragupta II, though younger, was nominated by his father Samudragupta to succeed himself, Yayāti selected his youngest son Pūru because he was devoted and obedient and the eldest and other sons disobeyed him. Vide Adiparva chap. 75 ff. and above p. 42. The principle of hereditary succession was so strong that even a boy king was placed on the throne. Vide Raghu. XVIII, 39. 

In almost all works on rājaśāstra there is a disquisition on the qualities that a good king should possess. Vide Kaut. VI. 1, Manu VII. 32-44, Yāj. I. 309-311 and 334, Sankha-Likhita 

quoted in R. D. K. III. p. 14 and Rājaniti-prakāśa p. 116, Santi 57. 12 ff. and 70, Kam. I. 21-22, IV. 6-24, XV. 31, Māna Bollāsa II. 1.1-9 (p. 29), Sukra I. 73-86, Vişnudharmottara II. 3, Only one or two passages can be set out here. Yāj. (I. 309-311 and 334) states 'a king should have great energy, should be generous, mindful of past (good or bad) turns done by others, dependent on those who are advanced (in austerities, knowledge and experience), possessed of a disciplined mind, endowed with an even temper (in good or bad luck), born of a noble family (on both sides), truthful, pure (in body and mind), prompt in action, of strong memory, not mean-minded, not harsh (in words or acts), observant of the rules of dharma (as to varnas and aśramas), free from vices, talented, brave, clever in concealing secrets (or acc. to Bhāruchi and Aparārka 'clever in scenting the secrets of his enemies'), guarding the weak points of his state, well-taught as regards logic, the science of govern ment, the science of wealth and the three vedas. He should be forbearing towards brāhmaṇas, straightforward towards his friends, wrathful towards his enemies, and should be (kind) like a father towards his servants and subjects'. Manu VII. 32 is very similar to Yāj. I. 334. The Mit. says that the qualities specified in Yāj. I. 309-311 are antaranga (inward or more essen tial). The 2nd quality 'sthūla-lakşa' occurs also in the inscrip tion of Rudradāman (E. I. vol. VIII. at p. 44). From I. 312 Yaj. states the bahiranga qualities viz. selection of ministers, purohita and sacrificial priests, gifts to worthy brāhmaṇas, protection &c. 

III ) 

Qualities required in a king 

Kautilya VI. 1 contains several lists of the king's qualities from several points of view. First, there is a list of qualities that make the king win the heart of the people (or make him approa chable) viz, being of a noble family, godly, spirited, consulting the aged, virtuous, truthful, not failing in his promises, grateful, taking broad views (not pusillanimous), highly enthusiastic, not given to procrastination, powerful enough to control his feudatories, firm in mind, having a council of ministers of no mean calibre, desirous of self-discipline. These are called 'ābhi gāmika-gunas' which word occurs in the Palitana plates of Dharagena II (of Valabhi) in E.I. vol. XI p. 83 and in the Māliya plate of the same king (Gupta Ins. pp. 164, 169 ). The Dasakumāra carita VII appears to make a pointed reference to this list when it makes a character say that the king (there referred to ) has in him all the qualities beginning from good family (sarvai. vātma-sampad-abhijanāt-prabhrti &c.) Then the intelleotual qualities he should possess are: desire to learn, study, under standing of what is studied and retaining it, reflection, discus sion and devotion to the principles accepted after discussion, Almost the same qualities of the intellect( dhi) are mentioned by Kām. IV, 22. The word 'sakyasāmanta'(in Kaut, VI. 1) occurs also in Agnipurāņa 239. 4. The qualities that are the different aspects of his enthusiasm (or energy ) are: valour, non-endurance (of the might of others), quickness (of action) and assiduity. The same occur in Kām. IV. 23. Then follows a long list of quali ties that go to make up the personal endowment of the king (atma-sampat). Gaut. (XI. 2, 4-6) requires that the king should 

do what is right (acc. to śāstras ) and speak (or decide) rightly, should be pure (at heart and externally), should control his senses, be possessed of qualified servants and endowed with knowledge of the means of policy, should be even-handed towards all his subjects and look after their welfare. The long list of Sankha-likhita agrees more or less with those of Kautilya and Yaj. Santiparva 70 states that the king should possess 36 quali ties, viz. he should not speak bitterly, he should be godly, not wicked, not haughty, of agreeable address &c. Kām. I. 21-22 mentions 19 qualities that lead to the well-equipped personality of the king (ātma-sampat), viz. study of sāstra (Dandaniti), intellect, serenity, cleverness, boldness, power of comprehension, energy, eloquence, firmness, capacity to endure the worries of adversities, majesty, purity, kindness, liberality, truthfulness, gratefulness, noble family, character, self-restraint. Then Kām. jo IV. 15-19 sets out the qualities called ātma-sampat, which 

46 

· History of Dharmasastra 

( Vol. 

generally agree with Kautilya's enumeration (in VI. 1). Acc. to Kām. IV. 24 liberality, truthfulness and valour are the three greatest qualities in a king, who, when endowed with these, aoquires all other qualities. The Managollāsa (II. 1. 2-7) first enumerates 44 qualities such as truthfulness, spiritedness (which agree more or less with Kautilya's enumeration) and then states that the five most essential qualities in a king are truthfulness, valour, forbearance, liberality and capacity to appreciate the worth of others. The Agnipurāṇa (239. 2-5) enumerates 21 qualities such as noble family, character &c. In the Parasurama pratāpa 96 qualities are enumerated in the Rajavallabhakanda (Ms. 239 of Višrāmabāg collection II, folio 21b). The Sabhāparva 5. 107-109 and Rāmāyaṇa II. 100.65-67 require the king to avoid 14 faults viz. atheism, falsehood, hot temper, carelessness, pro crastination, not seeing the wise, laziness, addiction to five pleasures of sense, considering state matters alone (without mantrins ), taking counsel with those who do not know politics, not starting to do what is decided upon, not guarding secret royal policy, not practising auspicious acts, taking up under takings on all sides at one and the same time. Vanaparva 251. 5 says that subjects do not like a king who is very timid, very weak, procrastinating, careless and immersed in pleasures on account of vices. Sabhā 5. 125 states that sleep (by day), lazi ness, timidity, hot tempor, softness and dilatoriness are six calamities in a king. 

The works on dharmaśāstra and arthaśāstra devote a good deal of space to the education of the king and to his moral dis cipline. Gaut. XI. 3 requires that the king should have received instruction in Trayı ( the three Vedas ) and Anvikşikl. This last has been differently interpreted by different writers. Kaut. I. 2 says that Antīkşiki comprehends Sānkhya, 57 Yoga and Loka

yata and that it examines the relative strength of the three other vidyās with reasons, and thereby benefits the world, steadies the mind in calamities and prosperity and imparts excellence in intellect, speech and actions. It is always the torch of ( sheds light on) all vidyās, it is the means of (inducing to go in for ) all undertakings, it is the source of all dharmas. Kautilya derives the name from the root 'iks' with 'anu' and he takes it to mean the science of ratiocination. It is somewhat strange that Lokāyata is included in Anvikşikl, one of the subjects of study for the prince. But it appears from the remarks he makes that Kauţ, uses it only in the sense of logic based on premises derived from ordinary experience (loka) though in later literature Lokayata came to mean 'nāstika' (atheist, materialist). Acc. ** 

(Continued from last page) III. 3. 53 and 54 states that the Laukāyatikas held the view that conscious ness is a quality of the body (and there is no soul over and above the body). The Tantravārtika runs them down as fools and apes (on Jaimini 1. 3.3). In the Rāmāyana Rāma asks Bharata not to resort to Lokāyatika brāhmanas, who, though childish, look upon tbemselves as learned and who relying on the knowledge acquired by Anvikșiki speak nonsense in spite of the fact that there are principal Dharmaśāstras ( that point out the sensible path ). लोकापतिकान मारतात सेबसे । अनर्धकुशला ते पाला। पण्डिसमानिमः ॥ धर्मशानेषु मुख्यषु विद्यमानेषु दुधाः । बुद्धिमाम्बीक्षिकी प्राप्य निरर्थे प्रवदन्ति ते ॥ अयोध्याकाण्ड 100. 38–39. The Kāmasūtra (1. 2. 30 ) says that the Laukāyatikas hold that a kārsāpaņa (copper coin) which one is certain of is better than a nişka (a gold coin) which is doubtful. * Fiat archite: Freigo pia mlar T: FIAT 1. 2. 30. Rajasekhara in his Kāvyamimānsā p. 37 (Gaekwad's O. series, ed. of 1934 ) refers to the opinion of the Laukāyatika logicians that the consciousness in human beings arises from the bhutas (elements) just as the power of intoxication (in wine) is due to the mixture of several ingredients (none of which may by itself be intoxicating). The Nitivākyāmsta p. 76 remarks " the Lokāyatika view leads to the effectuation of worldly affairs, for the king is able to uproot the thorns of the country by the help of Lokāyata", 016FITEETTATUAgi harf i mergaire

to the Amarakoša, Višvarūpa on Yāj. I. 306, Haradatta on Gaut. (XI. 3), Aparārka and several others Ānyikşiki means 'Logic'. Acc. to Kām. II. 7 and 11, the Mit. on Yaj. I. 311, Sukraniti I 158 it means 'Atmavidya' (Metaphysics), while Sukraniti I. 153 and Rājaniti-prakāśa p. 118 combine the two by saying that it is logic that leads on to or is useful for acquiring knowledge of the Self. The Nitimayūkha (p. 34) includes logic and Vedānta in Anvikşiki and Mimānsā and smrtis under Trayi. The Bārhaspatyasūtra (II. 5-6) advises the king to follow the Laukāyatika doctrines at the time of securing artha (wealth ) and the Kāpālika-sāstra in achieving his sexual and similar desires. 59 

Great divergence of views prevailed as to the vidyās that were essential for the education of the king. According to the Manusmrti VII. 43, Santi, 59.33, Kauţ. I. 2, Yāj. I. 311, Kām. II. %, Sukraniti I. 152, Agni. 238.8, the subjects for the king's education are four viz., Anyikşiki, Trayi, Vārtā and Dandaniti. Kaut. notes that the school of the Mānavas held the view that the vidyās were three and regarded Anvikşiki as a special branch of Trayi; that the Bārhaspatya school was of opinion that they were only two, Vārtā and Dandaniti, since Trayi only acted as a screen ( to obscure the intellect) of one (the king ) who wants to know the ways of the world; and the Auśanagas regard ed Daņdaniti as the only vidyā for a king, since according to them, the efforts to learn all vidyās are tied down to it (i. e. are ultimately intended to lead on to the mastery of Dandaniti). It will be seen how the Aušanasas and Bārhaspatyas had an entirely secular view in the science of government and divorced it from the study of sacred books and metaphysics in the case of the king. The Dasakumiracarita VIII (that displays a deep study of Kautilya) says that the vidyās for the king are four (catasro rajavidyās-traylvārtānvikşikıdandanitiḥ ). The Bārhas patyasūtrs I. 3 (Dandanstireva vidya) holds that Dandaniti is the only (essential) vidyā for the king. Kautilya further explains that dharma and its opposite are learnt from the three Vedas, viz. Sāmaveda, Rgveda and Yajurveda, that the Atharvaveda and Itihāsaveda (i.e. Itihasa and Puriņa ) are the other Vedas and that the six Angas also (viz. phonetics, ritual, grammar, etymology, metrics and astronomy) are comprehend

ed in the word “Tray180°. Sukraniti I. 155 says that the 14 vidyas ( enumerated in Yāj. I. 3) are comprehended in Trayi. Gaut. XI. 19 expressly says that in doing his duty of making the people observe the rules of the sacred codes the king would have to rely on the Veda, Dharmaśāstras, the Angas, Upavedas and Purāņa. In the Rāmāyaṇa, Rāma and his brothers are often spoken of as proficient in the Vedas, Vedāngas, in Dhanurveda, Gandharvaveda, Rājavidya &c. (I. 18. 24 and 26, II. 1.20, II. 2. 34-35, V. 35. 13-14). In the Vanaparva 277. 4 it is said that the princes were proficient in the Vedas with their secret doctrine and in Dhanurveda. In the Adiparva 221. 72-74 Abhimanyu is said to have learned from Arjuna before he became 16 the Dhanurveda in four sections, the knowledge of astras, and the theory and practice of these. Vide also Anusagana 104. 146-147. Khāravela in his Hathigumpha Inscription (E. I. vol. XX. p. 79 11.2 and 5) states that he learnt Lekha (official correspondence), Rūpa (currency ), Ganana ( Accountancy) and the admini stration of justice, when he was the crown prince and also Gandharvaveda (music). In the Junagadh Inscription of Rudradaman (E. I. vol. VIII at page 44) the Mahaksatrapa is said to have attained great fame by his deep study, retention, and actual practice of grammar, artha ( either lexicography or politics ), music, logic and other vidyas and to have been a fine rider of horses, elephants, chariots and a great adept in wielding the sword and shield and in wrestling. The personal attain ments of Samudragupta (in Gupta Inscriptions No. 1 pp. 12, 15-16 ) show how thorough the education of at least some princos was or at least what the ideal about their education was.

(Vol. 

Prasad's Theory of Government in Ancient India' p. 218 for an ideal course of education for a prince quoted from the Buddhist work, Sütrālankāra of Ašvaghoşa. The Nitivakyāmsta" adds a long list of the accomplishments which a prince should possess viz, all scripts, valuing of jewels, knowledge of arms &c. On reading the ideal courses prescribed for the education of the prince by ancient Indian writers one cannot help feeling that they were probably actuated by the same sentiments that are attributed to Socrates by Plato in his ' Republic' (tr. by Jowett, ed. of 1875, vol. III. p. 357) viz. 'Until philosophers are kings or the kings and princes of this world have the spirit and power of philosophy and political greatness and wisdom meet in one and these commoner natures who follow either to the exclu sion of the other are compelled to stand aside, cities will never cease from ill-no, nor the human race as I believe-and then only will our State have a possibility of light and behold the light of day &o.' The Agnipurāņa (225. 1-4) prescribes that the prince should be taught dharmaśāstra, kāmaśāstra, arthaśāstra, science of archery (dhanurveda ), the various arts and crafts by trusted teachers, that he should not be allowed to be associated with those who are angry with the king or disrespected by him or who are greedy and that if it is impossible to impart good qualities to him he should be confined, surrounded by pleasures. The princes were sometimes educated in their own capital or in a nearby college. Vide H. Dh. vol. II. p. 364. Sometimes, it appears, princes went to such famous seats of learning as Takşasila (vide Jatakas ed. by Fausböll I. 87, 278, 319, 323, 400, III. 158, 168, 415, 463). The subjects of study there were the three vedas and 18 silpāni or vidyās (Jātakas, vol. II. 87, III. 115 ). Kautilya (1. 4) explains that Vārtā is constituted by agricul ture, the rearing of cattle and trade; it benefits ( the State) by bringing in grain, cattle, gold, baser metals, and free labour; by means of vārts the king secures treasury and army whereby he brings under control his own side and the enemy. In the Sabhaparva 6 5.79 and Ayodhyākānda 100. 47 it is declared

Importance of vārtā 

that when the world relies on vārtā it easily prospers. The Santi-parva ( 263.3) gives the warning that this world would cease to exist if vārtā was given up, that this world is rooted in vārtā and is sustained by the three vedas (68.35 ). The Vanaparva (150.30) states that the whole world is sustained by vārtā i.e. by merchandise, mines, trade, agriculture and tending cows, she-goats and ewes. The Nitivakyāmsta (p. 93 ) after defining vārtā es above emphasizes that the king secures the abundance of everything when vārtā is prosperous and that the man who has his own agriculture, milch-cattle, plot for growing vegetables and a well in his own house has indeed all the pleasures of this world. These quotations indicate what importance was attached to agriculture and the economic structure of society. The result is that in the Arthaśāstra economic matters occupy a very large space. 

Kautilya (1.5) starts by saying that the three vidyās (except daņdaniti) in the case of the prince depend upon danda, that daņda in its turn is based upon discipline, which is of two kinds, natural and induced (or acquired). Vidyās produce discipline (of the 2nd kind) in him who possesses the qualities of intellect specified above. Then he goes on to say that the prince should learn the alphabet and arithmetic after his caula is performed (in the 3rd year or later) and after upanayana ho should learn the three vedas and anvikşikl from the sistas ( those learned in the veda), vārta from the heads or superin tendents ( of the various departments thereof) and dandanfti from expounders ( of the vidyā) and from practical politicians. Vide Manu VII. 43 ( =Matsya 215. 54 and Agni 225. 21-22 ) for directions as to from whom the prince was to learn the four vidyās. Kautilya prescribes that the prince should study these up to the 16th year, should then marry and that in order to foster the growth of the discipline of the intellect he should always associate with those who are advanced in the vidyās enumerated above (after his 16th year) and that the king should spend the first part of the day in practising the riding of elephants, horses, chariots and in the science of arms and the latter part of the day in listening to Itihasa which comprises Purana, history, stories, panegyrics, dharmasastra and artha śāstra. A king whose intellect is thus disciplined and who is devoted to disciplining his subjects also and to doing good to all will be the sole ruler of the earth. The Nitivākyāmsta (p. 162 ) defines vinaya as acting with humility towards those52

[Vol. 

who excel in vratas, vidyas and are aged.' Manu VII. 38-39. Kam. I. 19-20 and 59-63, Sukra I. 92-93 (taken from Kām. I. 19-20 ) extol the value and importance of vinaya and waiting upon the aged and the learned. Manu (VII. 40-42 ) states that many kings perished with their vast paraphernalia through want of digcipline while others, though residing in a forest (i.e. without an army &c.), gained kingdoms through vinaya, and names Vena, Nahusa, Sudās son of Pijavana and Sumukha Nimi as those who perished through lack of vinaya and gives Pșthu and Manu as examples of those who secured kingdoms through vinaya. Matsya 215,53 is the same as Manu VII. 40. Ancient Indian writers harp on the education of the prince so much because their ideal of kingship was that the king should be a rājar şi (a royal sage). Kalidasa frequently speaks of this e. g. in Śākuntala II. 14 and Raghuvansa (I. 58). They were aware, like Socrates, that until either philosophers became®4 kings or kings philosophers States will never succeed in remedying their short-comings ( vide p. 50 above). Not only was an extensive course of intellectual training prescribed for the king, but both dharmaśāstra and arthagāstra works strongly and frequently Insist upon the necessity of moral discipline and the right direct ion of the emotions and will in the case of the king. 

Kautilya (1.6) emphasizes that control of the organs of sense is the cause of (proficiency in) vidyās and discipline should be attempted by giving up the six enemical tendencies viz, lust, hot temper, greed, vanity (māna), haughtiness or insolence (mada ), overjoy. He says that (the whole purpose or insistence of ) all śāstras is the restraint of the senses, that even a supreme ruler of the whole earth up to its four borders whose senses are not under control will at once perish and cites two examples on each of these six tendencies, viz. Dāndakya Bhoja who attempted to rape a brāhmana girl through lust and perished with his kingdom and kinsmen and Karala king of Videha; Janamojaya (perished) who attacked brāhmaṇas through hot tempor and Tālajangha who did so against the Bhrgus; Aila who exacted through greed excessive taxes from poroons of the four varnas and Ajabindu, the king of Sauvira ; Ravana who did not restore another's wife through his conceit and Duryodhana who did not give even a part from his kingdom; Dambhodbhava who, despised all beings through his insolence and

Evil tendencies among kings

Arjuna of the Haihaya dynasty ; Vātāpi through overjoy when he attacked Agastya and also the oligarchy of the Vrspis when they attacked Dvaipāyana. Theso xix evil tendencies are called šatru-sad-varga or ari-sadvarga. Kautilya adds that by the conquest of these six evil tendencies Jāmadagnya (Parasurama) and Ambarisa enjoyed the earth for a long time. Kām. (I. 55 58) and Sukra. I. 144-146 give six of the twelve examples of Kaut, and Kām. I. 58 is the same as the last verse of Kautilya I. 6. Vide Mārkandeya 27. 12-13. In the Vasavadattā of Subandhu (Hall's od. pp. 273-276) there is a long list of the kings of antiquity (Purüravas, Nahusa, Yayāti, Sudyumna, Nala and nine others) who suffered owing to some failing or other in themselves. The Udyogaparva (74. 13-18) mentions by name 18 kings who by their evil career destroyed themselves, their friends and relatives (such as Mudāvarta of the Haihayas, Janamejaya of the Nipas, Bahula of Tālajanghas, Dhautamülaka of the Cinas). This shows that Cina does not probably stand for modern China in the epic. Manu VII. 44 (=Matsya 215.55 ) also emphasizes the necessity for the king incessantly to curb the senges and not to fall a prey to vices arising from kāma and krodha. Manu (VII. 45-48) enumerates ten vicious tendencies due to kāma (desire for pleasures ) viz. hunting, gambling, sleep by day, finding fault (with others), women, drunkenness, (excessive indulgence in) dancing, singing and instrumental music, and aimless wandering; and eight vicious tendencies due to krodha (hot temper) viz. tale-bearing, violence, treachery, envy, slander, (improper) seizure of property, reviling and assault. Manu further declares (VII. 50) that among the vices due to kāma, drinking wine, gambling, women and hunting are the most harmful, each preceding one being worse than each succeeding

For Agastya and Vātāpi vide Vanaparva 96. In the Mārkandeya the instances of kings that came to grief through kāma, krodha, lobha &c. are different except that of Aila (chap. 27, 14-17).

one and ( VII. 52) that among the vices due to hot temper, caus ing physical injury, reviling and deprivation of wealth are the worst. Manu (VII. 52) has a sly hit that these seven vices are more or less prevalent among kings (sarvatraivānuşanginah) and therefore the only choice is that of the lesser or least of evils Kautilya (VII. 3) has a lengthy disquisition on the views of his predecessors about the relative harmfulness of the three vices due to hot temper and of the four due to kāma and states his own opinion that arthadüşana meaning loss of the means of livelihood by gifts, exactions (by the king), loss or abandonment of pro perty is more harmful than reviling and dandapāruşya is more harmful than arthadūşana. He points out the benefits derived from hunting viz. exercise, the disappearance of phlegm, bile. fat and sweat, the acquisition of skill in aiming at stationary and moving bodies, the ascertainment of the minds of beasts when 

they are provoked and occasional travel.66 These are echoed, almost in the same words by Kām. XIV. 25 and in the Sakuntala (II. 25 ) by Kalidāsa. Vide Sabhā 68. 20, Udyoga 33.92 for the seven principal vices. Kām. (XIV. 6 and 7) enumerates the three vices of hot temper and the four of kama and holds an elaborate discussion on their respective demerits. He defines arthadūşana (XIV, 17) somewhat differently (viz. as the aban doning of an important object or of great wealth in order to show that what really merits blame is not so). Vide the Vişnudharmot tara II.65.12-15 for the two meanings of arthadūşana67. Kām, does not agree that hunting has many good points in its favour and advises the king to prepare a separate well-guarded hunting ground of one-half yojana in length and breadth if he really desires to hunt ( XIV. 28-42). The Mānasollāsa (vol. II) in the 15th chapter of the 4th vimšati deals with hunting as a sport for kings and points out how a forest is to be preserved for royal hunting and how it is to be guarded and enumerates 31 methods of hunting. Kām, warns the king who wants to retain

his kingdom against fondness for women (XIV. 57-58). He further says that a king may even indulge in fondness for women and may even drink moderately, but he must totally avoid gambling and hunting (XIV. 65). Kautilya regards gambling as the worst of the vices for a king (VIII. 3 last sentence in prose). In the Daśakumāracarita (VIII) there is an elaborate (but ironical) description of the mental and other benefits derived from the four principal vices due to kāma. Kām. I. 54 states that hunting, gambling and wine in the case of kings must be condemned, since calamities befell Pāndu, Nala and the Vrsnis (respectively ) by being addicted to these. Even an ideal king like Rama was fond of hunting. Sukra (I. 332-333) points out that hunting has much in its favour, but there is one great defect in it viz. slaughter of animals. Sukra (I. 109-119 ) denounces gambling, drinking and fondness for women as the worst of vices and points out that Indra, Dandakya, Nahuşa and Rāvana came to grief through their passion for women (1. 114) and that a king who is excessively fond of dancers, singers, courtesans, wrestlers, eunuchs and men of low birth falls an easy prey to his enemies (I. 128 ). Kām. (I. 40-46, which are almost the same as Sukra I. 102-107) gives a poetic description of how animals like the deer, the elephant, the moth, the fish and the bee meet death or become confined by extreme attach ment to one only out of the five objects of sense and emphasizes that man who can and does enjoy all the pleasures of the five senses must practise great restraint. 

CHAPTER tft 

DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF 

THE RULER. 

All works are agreed that the first and foremost duty of the king is the protection of subjects. Sāntiparva (68.1-4) notes that all the seven expounders of polity (rājaśāstraprane tāraḥ) named by it extol protection as the highest dharma of the king. Manu VII. 144 states that the protection of subjects is the highest dharma and Kālidāsa in Raghuvamsa 14.67 alludes to this dictum of Manu. Protection consists in punishing internal aggression (such as by thieves and robbers and by persons who invade a man's rights ) and in meeting external 88 aggression. Vide quotation from Bphaspati below. Gautama (X. 7-8) prescribes that the special responsibility of the king is to protect all beings, to award just punishment and that he has to protect the several varnas and aśramas according to the rules of śāstra and to bring them round to the path of their proper duties when they swerve from it (XI. 9-10). Vasiştha ( 19. 1-2) states that the wise say that protection is a life-long sattra in which he has to give up fear and softness of heart. Vas. 19.7-8 and Vişnu Dh. S. III. 2-3 are similar to Gaut. XI. 9-10. The Sāntiparva ( 23.15 ) repeats a gātha of Bphaspati. As a snake gwallows mice lying in holes, so the earth swallows these two viz, a king who does not fight (an invader) and a brāhmana who does not go on a journey (for acquiring knowledge from famous teachers ) 68a Manu IX. 306 states that the king pro tecting his subjects according to the śāstra and meting out punishment to those who deserve it performs every day sacrifices in which the fees are one hundred thousand cows (i.e. he secures the spiritual reward of very solemn sacrifices). Yāj. I. 335 is to the same effect. Kautilya also lays emphasis on the duty to keep the varņas and aśramas to their duties 'Therefore the

Duties of the king 

king should not allow the people to swerve from their duties. He, who keeps dharma intact (without breach), enjoys bliss in this world and the next'. Nārada 59 (prakırnaka 33 ) states * His duty is to protect the subjects, to (honour or ) listen to the aged and the wise, to look into the disputes of people and to be energetio in his functions as king'. Sukra (I. 14 ) says that the highest dharma of the king is to protect the subjects and to put down the wicked. According to Atri (verge 28 ), 70 to punish the wicked, to honour the good, to increase the treasury in the right way, to deal impartially with litigants and to protect the kingdommthese five are declared to be sacrifices in the case of kings. The Vispudharmottara (III. 323, 25-26 ) refers to the five sacrifices in very similar words. In Santi 77. 33 the king's duty to restrain brāhmaṇas from engaging in unworthy actions is specially emphasized. These passages establish that the principal duties of the king were conceived to be to protect the subjects, to see that the rules of varnas and āśramas were carried out by them, to punish the wicked and to do justice. 

The duty to protect involved fighting and probable death. Therefore the ancient works on dharma-śāstra always insist that it is the duty of the kşatriya to fight and that death on the battlefield is to be his highest ideal. Manu (VII. 87-89) enjoins upon the king, when protecting his subjects against invasion, not to run away from battle and promises heaven as the reward for kings who die fighting in battle. Yāj. I. 324 holds forth the game reward for all soldiers who are killed in battle. Vide Striparva 2.16 and 18 and 11. 8-9. The Bhagavadgitā (II. 31-37) most solemnly declares that there is nothing higher for a kaatriya than a righteous war, that a kşatriya's duty requires him not to quail in battle, that if he dies in battle he goes to heaven and if he survives he rules over the world, that he should fight as a duty without caring for gain or loss, victory or defeat and if he fights with this attitude no sin attaches to him. Sānti. parva 78. 31 states that just as those who join in the bath of the king at the end of the Aśramedha are purified of all sins, so all

soldiers (of whatever caste and on whatever side ) killed in battle become pure by the destruction of their sins. Manu ( VII. 94-95) sets out the results for a soldier when he flees from the battlefield. Parāśara? III. 37 says “Two men pierce the orb of the sun (i. e. reach heavenly worlds) viz. an ascetic endowed with Yoga and a soldier killed while facing the enemy" and the following verses (III. 38 ff) dilate upon how the slain warrior is waited upon in heaven by divine damsels. A verse of the Rgveda X. 154, 3 ( Atharva 18. 2. 17) appears to hold that warriors losing life in battle reap the same rewards that those who make gifts of a thousand cows in sacrifices secure. It is probably this passage which Kautilya has in mind when in X. 3 he refers to the Voda for inciting the soldiers to fight without regard to life. Ap. Dh. S. (II. 10. 26. 2-3) states that a king, who strives to recover the wealth of brāhmanas (stolen by thieves) and dies in the effort, is said to perform a sacrifice, in which his body is the sacrificial post and the fees are incalculable and that other valiant men losing life in fighting for a (good) cause are in a similar position. To die fighting for the protection of cows and brāhmaṇag is specially commended (vide Santi 21. 19 and 77.28 and 30). The Visnudharmasütra III. 44-46 prescribes there is no duty for kings equal to losing one's life in battle; those who meet death in protecting a cow, a brāhmana, a king, a friend, their own wealth and their wife enter heaven as also those who meet death 

in preventing confusion of varnas (caused by adultery &c.).' On the eye of battle the great warrior Bhişma says to his officers 

it is a sinful act for a ksatriya to die in his house from some disease; the ancient code of conduct for him is that he should meet death from steel' (Bhişmaparva 17. 11). The same idea is presented in Salyaparva 5. 32, Santi 97. 23 and 25. 

Kamandaka 78 (V. 82-83) makes it clear that the subjects require protection against the king's officers, thieves, enemies of the king, royal favourites (like the queen and the princes) and

the greed of the king himself. As an extension of the king's duty to protect, the works lay down that it is his duty to support students, learned brāhmanas, and sacrificers. 74 Vide Gaut. X. 9-12, XVIII. 31, Kaut. II. 1, Anušāsana 61. 28-30, Santi 165. 6-7, Vişnudharmasūtra III. 79-80, Manu VII. 82 and 134, Yāj. I 315 and 323 and III. 44, Matsya 215. 58, Atri 24. The Hindu kings of ancient and medieval India followed this advice with great liberality for centuries and the subject has already been treated in vol. II. pp. 113,856-864, The functions of Government were not supposed to end with the maintenance of peace and order, but Government must be an instrument of the diffusion of culture, The king is also called upon to support helpless and aged people, the blind, the cripple, lunatics, widows, orphans, those suffering from diseases and calamities, pregnant women by giving them medi cines, lodging, food and clothing according to their requirements?s. Vide Vas. 19.35-36, Vişnudharmasūtra III. 65, Matsya 215. 62, Agni 225. 25, Adiparva 49, 11, Sabhā 18. 24, Virātaparva 18. 24, Santi 77. 18. The Rājaniti-prakāśa (pp. 130-131 ) quotes the Vişnudharmottara requiring the king to honour and protect chaste women (pativratās) and Sankha-Likhita to the effect that even kşatriyas and vaiśyas who cannot maintain themselves by the methods prescribed by the śāstras for them should approach the king who should help them with the means of livelihood and they should work for the king in the manner laid down for them and that sūdras also should apply their skill and crafts for the benefit of the king when so maintained." Medhātithi on Manu V. 94 states that when a king supports his subjects in a famine by distributing food from his treasury no question of his being in mourning would come in the way. These provisions for the old, the blind, the widows, orphans and helpless persons and for the relief of unemployed kşatriyas, vaiśyas and sūdras strike one as

rather modern in tone. In many modern countries the State has become the means of providing services for the greater part of its subjects, not only armed forces and the police, but social services such as education, public health, medical attendance, insurance against unemployment, old age, widowhood, and orphanage, relief of poverty &o. In ancient India, though there were naturally no Acts of Parliament guaranteeing the above services to the subjects, public opinion, the views of eminent writers and the practice of the best kings created an atmosphere in which it was thought that it was imperative for the king representing the State and its resources to encourage learning, to care for the blind, the decrepit, the old and the widowed and to give employment to those who were unemployed. Asoka constructed hospitals for men and animals (2nd Rock Edict at Kalsi in C. I. I. vol. 1, p. 28), alms-houses, rest houses, watering places, shady trees on the highways and irrigation works, visited and supported the aged (8th Girnar Rock Edict in C. I I. p. 15). In the 2nd century B.C. Khāravela, emperor of Kalinga, declares in his Hāthigumpha Inscription (E. I. vol. XX p. 71 at p. 86) that in the very first year of his reign he constructed embankments round the Khibfra lake in the Kalinga capital and renovated all public gardens. Rudradāman in the 2nd century A. D. repaired the Sudarsana lake at great cost from his own treasury without levying fresh taxes or benevolences (pranaya) or forced labour. The Anušāsanaparva says that good kings should construct meeting halls, prapās, tanks, temples and lodging places for brāhmaṇas. The Matsyapurāna 215. 64 remarks that the king should give to those who stay in hermitages food, oil and pots. Vide Ap. Dh. 8. II. 2. 4. 21 and Haradatta thereon as to provision for śūdra guests. It is quite possible that these rules of the texts were not literally followed by all kings, but it is well-known how even legislative enactments are carried out by the subordi nato staff in all countries including those of the West. One has only to turn to Dickens''Oliver Twist' for some indication of the administration of Poor Laws and work-houses in England about a hundred years ago.

detailed rules, which have been already set out (H. of Dh. vol. II pp. 805-806). Every day on rising from his bed the king was advised (by Manu VII. 37) to wait upon brāhmaṇas learned in the three Vedas and endowed with wisdom and to abide by their directions. Vas. I. 39-41, Gaut. XI. 13-14 say the same. In giving this advice exaggerated claims were made for brāhmaṇas which have been already set out before. Vide H. Dh, vol. II pp. 135-136 and Anusāsana 33. 2-8. The king was also expected to show himself to all people every day (Ayodhyā 100. 51, Sabhā 5.90)", 

An extremely high ideal was placed before the king by the Kautilsya, the Mahābhārata and other works. In the Artha sāstra I. 19 Kautilya 80 proclaims the magnificent ideal 'in the happiness of the subjects lies the happiness of the king, in their welfare lies his welfare; the good of the king does not consist in what is pleasing to himself, but what is pleasing to the subjects constitutes his good'. Similar words occur in the Visnudharmasūtra III. last verse. 81 The Mahābhārata (Šānti 69. 72-73) purports to quote two verses of Angiras (i.e. Bphaspati), one of which says ' of what use is tapas to that king or of what use are oven sacrifices to him who has well looked after his subjects? He is surely one who knows all dharmas.' Kautilya compares the king to the performer of a sacrifice, in which his vrata 8( in the case of the sacrificer observances about food, scratching the body &c.) consists in being ever active, the sacrifice consists in issuing orders for carrying out the business ( of the State), the sacrificial fee (that the king pays) is his

impartiality to all (lit. behaving in the same way to all ), and his coronation corresponds to the bath of the person who is consecrated for a sacrifice. Sāntiparva 83 ( 56. 44 and 46 ) and Nitiprakāśika VIII. 2 declare that a king like a pregnant woman should not do what is pleasing to him, but what would conduce to the good of the people and the ancient dharma for a king is to keep the subjects contented. In śānti 90. 1 and 5 it is said the king is there for the upholding of dharma and not for acting as he likes and that all beings have to depend on dharma which in its turn depends on the king'. In Udyogaparva 118. 13-14 a king exclaims the wealth I possess is for the benefit of the urban and rural population and not for ny own enjoyment; for, that king who at his sweet will gives away what ( really is not his but) belongs to others does not become endowed with spiritual merit nor with fame'. King Marutta is warned by his grand-mother in the Mārkandeya 84 ( 130. 33–34 ) that the king's body is not meant for pleasures but for undergoing great trouble in protec ting the earth and carrying out his duties. Ancient writers loved to dwell upon the rule of the king as paternal. Kaut, II. 1 states that the king should favour like a father those who are outside the rules for remission of taxes. Yāj. J. 334 requires the king to be like a father to his subjects and servants. Vide Sānti 139, 104-105 for the same idea. 85 In the Rāmāyaṇa II. 2. 28-47 and V. 35. 9-14 the virtues of the prince Rāma are set out in great detail, where it is said that Rāma behaved like a father (II. 2. 39), that he sympathized with the people in their sorrows and was pleased like a father when the subjects celebrated festivals. The Rāmāyaṇa 86 III. 6. 11 declares that it would be a great adharma on the part of that king who takes a

sixth part of the produce (of fields ) and does not protect his subjects' as if they were his children. These sentinents are echoed by classical poets like Kālidāsa in the Sakuntala V. 5 and VI. 23 and the Raghuvamsa (I. 24 ). In the Harşa carita (V) the dying king Prabhākaravardhana consoles his young and favourite son Harsa by exhorting him to reflect over the idea that kings are to be deemed to have relatives in their subjects and not merely in agnates. 86a Asoka also in his Edicts harps on the paternal relation all men are my children' (the first separate Jaugadh Edict, C. I I. vol I pp. 111 and 114). 

There were, it appears, several grades of rulers from the most ancient times. The word rūjan occurs in numerous places in the Rgveda. It is applied to such gods as Mitra and Varupa (Rg. VII. 64. 2), Varuņa (Rg. I. 24. 12 and 13, X. 173. 5). It appears to be used in two senses, viz. (1) ' king' as in Rg. I. 65. 7, II. 43. 5 ( 'will you make me the protector of people, the king, O Indra '), 1V. 4.1, IX. 7.5, X. 174. 4) and (2) noble' as in Rg. IX. 10.3, X. 78. 1, X. 97.6 ( where the plants come together as nobles in an assembly' rūjānaḥ samitūviva). In Rg. VIII. 21. 18 it is said 87 Citra who gave thousands and ten thousands is the only king, others are only small chiefs along the bank of the Sarasvati'. The word 'samrāj' is known to the Rgveda and is used as an epithet of Varuņa (in Rg. VI. 68.9) and of Indra ( in Rg. VIII. 16.1 ) and the word sāṁrājya also occurs in relation to Varuņa in Rg. I. 25. 10. In Rg. VIII. 37.3 Indra is said to be sole ruler of the world ( ekarāt). It is not un likely therefore that the idea of an emperor who had suze rainty over several kings was known, though it is possible that in Rg. VIII. 37. 3 the word is used only in a metaphorical sense. In Rg. VII. 83. 7-8 $7a it is said that ten kings though they formed a confederacy could not vanquish king Sudās and that in the ten kings' battle ( dāśarājie ) Indra and Varuņa helped Sudās who was surrounded by them on all sides. A very large number of kings is mentioned by name in numerous places in the Rgveda (e. g. I. 53. 8 and 10, I. 54. 6, I. 100, 17, VII. 33, 2, VIII. 3. 12, VIII. 4. 2). Besides these it appears that there were

tribal chiefs or governments of such clans or tribes as the Anus, Druhyus, Turvašas, Pūrus, Yadus (Rg. I. 108. 8, all in the plural, VII 18. 6 and VIII. 6. 46). But sometimes these words are used in the singular, when they mean'a king or chief of that clan'. Vide Rg. VIIL 4.7, VIII. 10.5, IV. 30. 17. In the Atharvaveda III. 4. 1 (may you shine forth as the sole ruler of men) that word (ekarāt) is used in its literal sense and in Atharva VI.98.1 (may87) Indra conquer and may he never be defeated, may he shine as the overlord among kings) the idea of an emperor (adhirāja) is clearly set forth. In Rg. X. 128. 988 the word 'adhi rāja' must be taken in the same sense. The Atharvaveda speaks of an Ugra which word seems to mean a formidable king (or emperor) 'Then you chase away disease as a formidable ( king ) who is in the midst (of many kings presses hard each of them)' IV.9. 4. In the Atharvaveda III. 4. 3 it is said 'May the ugra Bee a lot of tribute'. In Rg. X. 34. 8 the word ugra has probably the same sense viz. 'a formidable king'. In the Tai. S. 11. 6. 2. 2 it is said that men are held (supported or restrained) by the king ( tasmād rājñā manusyā vidhștāḥ). In the Tai. S.

May the gods extract for men great power, great overlordship, great sovereignty over people; this, o Bharatas, is your king, while Soma is king of us brāhmaṇas'. The exact relation of the two words 'adhipatya' and 'jānarajya' is not clear. Similar words occur in Vāj. S. IX. 40 and X. 18 and in Kathaka XV.5. In the Ait. Br. (39.1) it is said that whoever desires the king to attain supremacy over all kings, to attain to the rank of emperor...and desires that he be the supreme ruler, the sole emperor (ekarāt) of the whole earth bounded by the sea up to its very extremities should be consecrated and crowned with the Aindra Mahābhişeka after making him take an oath.'

Grades of sovereignty 

relation to sovereignty over people are not clear. They are probably hyperbolical and grandiloquent words to convey sup reme power. Even a brāhmaṇa, according to vedic texts, may perform the Vājapeya if he desires 'svārājya 'which means super eminence. Parameşthin means ' Prajāpati'and so pāramesthya simply means godlike power. Further there is no apparent reason why, after rising high from sāmrajya to pārameşthya' there should be a descent to mere 'rājya' and ' māhārājya'. Sayaņa" takes rājya' and 'māhārājya' at the end of the passage as referring to the position of the king in the next world. This is rather far-fetched. Jayaswal (in “Hindu Polity', part 1 pp. 89-90 and p. 133 ) takes these words to mean 'the Bhaujya constitution &c.' relying on the occurrence of the Bhojas in Asoka's Rock Edicts V and XIII and in Khāra vela's Inscription, on the appearance of Bhojas as rulers in Western India and the town of Bhuj in Cutch and 'vairājya' as kingless system and 'svārājya' as 'self-ruling system'; but this is all unwarranted and is a fair sample of the way in which some of Jayaswal's theories are built up. It passes one's understanding how a paramount sovereign is promised vairājya (in Jayaswal's sense ) in the Ait. Br. In the Rgveda (V. 66. 6 ) we have the word 'svarājya' (which probably means the same thing as * svārājya') in 'Let us strive for an all-embracing sovereignty, which will afford protection to many '98 In the Satapatha Brāhmana the distinction between a king (rājan) and an emperor is very clearly expressed as follows: "For, by offering the Rājasūya he becomes king and by the Vājapeya he becomes emperor; and the office of king is the lower and that of emperor higher' (V. 1. 1. 13). Satapatha IX. 3. 4. 8 contains the same idea again. In Satapatha I. 6. 4. 21 it is said 'before the slaying of Vftra he was Indra, it is true; but after slaying Vitra he became Mahendra, even as a king (rājan) becomes a mahārāja after obtaining victory'. These passages are sufficient to establish that the idea of a suzerainty extending over many kingdoms was known in the times of the Rgveda and had been fully developed before the composition of the Aitareya and Satapatha Brahmanas.

History of Dharmadāstra 

(Vol. 

The Aitareya Brāhmaṇa mentions by name twelve emperors' of ancient India and the Satapatha thirteen (XIII. 5. 4. 1-19 ). Panini explains (V. 1. 41-42) 'sārva-bhauma' as 'the lord of the whole earth'. The Amarakosa states that the words "rāi', * pārthiva', 'kşmābhft', 'nşpa', 'bhūpa' and 'mahiksit' are synonyms and mean “king', that a king before whom all feudatories humble themselves is styled 'adhiśvara', 'cakravartin', 

sārvabhauma ' i. e. these three last words are synonyms. The word 'cakravartin' is derived" by Kşirasvāmin as one who wields lordship over a circle of kings' or who makes the circle (i. e. kingdom ) abide by his orders'. The word 'cakravartin', though not so ancient as 'sārvabhauma', has been employed from very ancient times. The Maitri Upanigad 1. 4 mentions 15 cakra varting. The Rājanitiprakāśa (p. 58 ) quotesos a passage from the Samavidhāna Brāhmaṇa ( III. 5. 2) 'the priest should perform the coronation with the Ekavrşa Sāman for that king whom he desires to be the sole ruler and whose circle of territory (he does not desire ) to be overwhelmed ( by an enemy )'. Here probably is one of the earliest references to the derivation of the word cakravartin. In the Mahāvagga (Selasutta, 8. B. E, vol. X p. 102 ) Lord Buddha is made to say "I am a king, an incomparable, religious king ( dharmarāja ); with justice (dhammena) I turn the wheel, a wheel that is irresistible'. Here the idea of the secular cakravartin is carried into the moral and spiritual sphere. In the Nānāghāt Inscription (of about 200 B. C.) occurs the word 

apratihatacakasa' (i. e-cakrasya). Vide ASWI, vol. V. p. 50 at p.60. Khāravela is styled Kalinga-cakravartin in the Mañchapuri record of his chief queen (E. I. vol. XX p. 86n), supavatavijaya caka' (supravșttavijaya-cakra, in l. 14 ) and pavata-caka' (pravstta-cakra in l. 17 ) of his Hāthigumpha Inscription (E. I. vol. XX at pp. 88–89). Kautilya (IX. 1) defines the land of the cakravartino as the territory on the earth spreading towards the

north from the sea to the Himalaya, which is a thousand yojanas in extent when measured in & straight line. The same idea occurs in the Kāvyamimāmsā of Rajasekhara (p. 92). Kautilya also employs the expression 'cāturanto rājā' (a king of the earth up to its four boundaries ). Sānti-parya 97 speaks of a ruler who brings the whole earth under one umbrella. On the birth of Harsa, the chief astrologer told his father Prabhākaravardhana that the boy would be the leader of the seven cakravartins (Harşacarita IV). In some works the six cakravartins are said to be Māndhātā, Dhundhumāra, Hariscandra, Purūravas, Bharata, Kārtavirya. The Sabhāparva (15. 15-16 ) mentions five emperors of old viz. Yauvanāśva ( Māndhātā ), Bhagiratha, Kārtavirya, Bharata and Marutta. Vide Dr. N. N. Law's ' Aspects of Ancient Indian Polity' pp. 17-21 for exhaustive lists of ancient emperors, from the Mahābhārata, the Satapatha Brāhmana and other works. This ideal of cakravartin was set before them by all ambitious and energetic Indian rulers from ancient times. The result was that constant wars took place. We have a galaxy of historical emperors that emulated such mythical heroes and emperors as Māndhātā and Bharata and practically realized the ideal. To name only a few, Candragupta, Asoka, Puşyamitra, Bhavanāga of the Bhāraśivas, Pravarasena Vākātaka, Samudragupta and Harga are great names in our ancient history. Even if this ideal of universal empire had not been there, wars could not have been avoided. That was a very usual thing everywhere in the ancient world. Only about 700 years ago, Britain, which is a very small country compared to India, had three kingdoms engaged in constant warfare. 

The Matsya-purāna (114. 9-10 ) first gives the dimensions of Bharata Varșa from South to North (from Cape Comorin to the source of the Ganges) as one thousand yojanas, states that its extent is ten thousand yojanas ( when measured upwards across the boundaries ) and that on all borders of it there are Mlecchas and that Yavanas and Kiratas dwell to its east and west (verse 11 ) and that the king who conquers the whole of Bharatavarsa is styled 'samrāt' (verse 15 ). Vide Brahmapurāņa 17. 8 ff for almost the same words. The Sukranitisāra (I. 183-187) states that a sāmanta is one whose yearly revenue is from 1 to 3 lakhs of silver karşas without oppressing the people, the revenue of a māndalika is from 4 to 10 lakhs, that of a rājan is from 11 to 20

lakhs, of a mahārāja from 21 to 50 lakhs, of a syarat from 51 lakhs to a crore, of a virāț from two crores to ten, of the sārva bhauma (who wields suzerainty over the whole earth i. e. Bharatavarşa ) from 11 crores to 50. Though these definitions may be regarded as scholastic and too rigid to have been praotically followed they do convey a sufficiently clear idea about the power of a feudatory, a king and an emperor. The Sabhāparva. * ( 15.2 ) says there are kings in each house, who do what pleases them; but they do not reach the position of emperor, which title can be acquired with great difficulty', and 'that king under whose sole dominion the world abides secures the position of sairāj' In these and other places 'world'means 'Bharatayarşa'for which see H. Dh. vol. II pp. 17-18. Sovereignty (sāṁrājya) consisted in ancient India not necessarily or invariably in acquiring con trol over vassal kings in all their affairs. Generally the supreme ruler did not hanker after territory so much as after having his superior prowess acknowledged. The descriptions of digvijayas (world conquests) in the Mahābhārata (e. g. of Pandu in Adi 113, of Arjuna and the other Pandava brothers in Sabha, chap, 26-32) show that there was no aggrandizement by acquiring fresh territory but all that was desired was to make the several kings submit and pay tribute or offer presents. Arjuna expressly says in Sabhā 25.3 that he would bring tribute from all kings and the conquered kings are generally represented as submitting and making presents of gems, golds, horses, cows to the conqueror. The Allahabad stone pillaro9 Inscription of Samudragupta (Gupta Ing. p. 8) states that the pratyanta (bordering) kings of Samatata and other countries and the Mālava and other tribal oligarchies fully gratified Samudra gupta's coñmands by giving all tribute, by obeying his orders and by coming to perform obeisance. Sānti 96 insists that conquests should be made according to dharma. Empire did not mean imposition of the language or the government system of the conqueror on the conquered country. The conqueror's duty as understood by ancient Indian works was quite different

Gauda ant when he started 

as will be presently shown, Kautilya (XII. 1) declares log that there are three kinds of invaders, viz, dharmavijayin (who is Matisfied with mere submission or obeisance), lobhavijayin ( who is satisfied with gain in land and money), asuravijayin ( who is not satisfied with land and money only but robs the defeated king of his son, wife and life). The Nitivākyāmsta (pp. 362-363, Yuddhasamuddeśa) defines the three almost in the same words. This shows that in the first two kinds of conquests the conquered state retained its own institutions, organization and government intact. Bāna gives 101 in very striking language what Harga proclaimed when he started against the treacherous king of Gauda and on digvijaya. It appears that even the queens of vanquished chiefs had to perform the duties of maids at the time of the coronation of the emperor and empress, as queen Yašomati says to Harsa (in Harşacarita V). Vide Sabhā 31. 73-74 where Bibhisana is said to have come with presents to Sahadeva. Asoka (in Kalsi Edict No. XIII in C. I. I. I, pp. 44 and 46, ed. by Hultzsch) speaks of his conquest being dharma vijaya. This means that he foreswore greed and cruelty and wanted that his influence be only acknowledged. The Pallava king Sivaskandavarman (of Kāñci) who had performed the Agnistoma, Vājapeya and Aśvamedha sacrifices calls himself dhamma-mahārājādhirāja (a dharma-vijayı emperor) in E. I. vol. I. p. 5. In the Dudia plate of Pravarasena II, Pșthvigena is styled dharma-vijayin (E. I. vol. III p. 258 at p. 261). Samudra gupta's conquest of South India seems to have been only a dharmavijaya. As time went on the titles of kings grew in grandiloquenoe. Asoka whose empire extended at least from Afganistan to the Bay of Bengal and included some part of the Deccan and Mysore calls himself 'rājo'. Khāravela is styled only mahārāja and Kalingadhipati in the Hāthigumpha Inscription,

History of Dharmasastra 

(Vol. 

Huviska, the Kuşaņa emperor, is styled Mahārāja rājātirāja devaputra ( E. I. vol. I. pp. 371, 386). Samudragupta is simply mahārāja (Gupta Inscriptions p. 8). But later emparors styled themselves paramabhattāraka-mahārājādhiraja (Gupta Inscrip tions p. 70, Indore copperplate of Skandagupta of Gupta year 146 i. e. 465-66 A, D.) or sometimes 'parama-bhattāraka-maha rājādhirāja-parameśvara' (Gupta Inscriptions No. 39, p. 176 copperplate of the Valabhi king Silāditya in 447 of the Valabhi era i. e. 766-67 A. D.). Ancient works are not very particular about the epithets they employ when speaking of a king or an emperor. Śānti (68.54) says that a king is praised with the epithets rājan, bhoja, virāt, samrāt, ksatriya, bhūpati and nộpa. 108 Dasaratha is styled rājā in Ayodhyā 2.2. and mahā rāja in 18.15 and 57.32. The Rājanitiratnākara (pp. 3-4) holds that kings are of three kinds; viz. emperor (samrāt), one who pays tribute and one who does not pay even tribute (but is not a samrāt), quotes several verses from a work of Nārada on politics and states that the words cakravartin, samrāt, adhisvara and mahārāja are synonyms. Kings aspiring to be called samrāt performed the Rājasüya and Aśvamedha in ancient India. The Sabhāparva 13,30 speaks of Rājasūya as fit to be performed by a samrāț. Senāpati Puşyamitra (about 180 B. C.) is said to have performed two Aśyamedhas (vide E. I. vol. XX p. 54, 57). The Ghosundi Inscription (E. I. vol. 16 p. 25 and E. I. vol. 22 p. 198) speaks of Sarvatāta, a great devotee of Vişnu, as a performer of Aśvamedha. Khārayola (who was a Jain) performed Rājagüya (E. I. vol. XX at p. 79). The Vākāțaka king Pravarasena I had performed four Aśvamedhas (E. I. vol. III. p. 258 and Gupta Inscriptions No. 55). In the Vākātaka copperplatea the Bhārašivas are extolled as having performed ton Ašvamedhas (E. I. III. 258 at p. 260). The Sālankāyana king Vijayadevavarma, whose capital was at Vengi in Andhra, is said to have performed an Aśramedha (E. I. IX. p. 56, about 350 A. D). The Cālukya king Pulakesin I had performed Ašva medha (E. I. vol. VI p. 1 and IX. p. 100) about 550 A. D. Puşya mitra is styled simply Senapati in the Malavikāgnimitra Act V when he sends a message to his son about attending the Rajasūya in which he had been engaged. For the significance of the Abhi gecaniya rite in Rājasūya vide H. of Dh. vol. II pp. 1216-1218. The Kadambas are said to have performed Aśvamedhas in the Nilambur plates (E. I. vol. VIII p. 148). The Vişnukundin

The conqueror's duties 

Mahārāja Madhavavarman performed eleven Advamedhas and one thousand Agnistomas (I. H. Q. Vol. IX p. 278). Vide H. Dh. vol. II pages 1238-1239 for a few more historic examples of the performers of Aśvamedha. 

Kautilya (VII 16 ) prescribes that the conqueror should not covet the territory, wealth, sons and wives of the slain (in battle), that he should re-instate the late king's kinsmen in their proper places (or positions ), that he should instal the son of the deceased king on the throne of his father and adds that the emperor who kills or imprisons the kings that submit and covets their lands, wealth, sons or wives provokes the mandala (the circle of States ) and makes it rise against himself. Yājõavalkya (I. 342-43 ) prescribes that it is the duty of the conqueror to protect the conquered country in the same way as his own country and the conqueror is to respect the customs of the con quered country, its laws and the usages of the families therein. 

The Visnudharmagūtra 108 ( ILI. 42 and 47-49 ) enjoins upon the conqueror not to uproot the usages of the conquered country, to establish in its capital some kinsman ( of the slain king) and not to destroy the royal family unless it be of low birth. Manu ( VII. 202-203) and Agnipurāņa 23622 prescribe similar rules. The Rāmāyaṇa (VII. 62:18-19) requires the conqueror, after uprooting the king, to establigh another king there in order to ensure stable government. Vide Sānti 33-43-46 quoted above on p. 40. Katyāyana (q. in the Rājanitiprakāśa p. 411) prescribes that even when the (vanquished) king is at fault, the conqueror should not ruin the country (for the fault of the vanquished king ), since he (the vanquished king ) did not start (on his career of) wrong-doing with the consent of his subjects. The Rājanitiprakāśa draws from this the conclusion that the ministers with whose consent the war was started may be harassed by the conqueror. This advice was generally followed by ancient conquerors and emperors. Rudradāman (150 A. D.) is styled the establisher of kings that had lost their territories (in the Junagadh Ins., E. I. vol. VIII at p. 44) and in the Allahabad Stone Pillar Inscription of Samudragupta it is said that his fame travelled over the whole world because of his

( Vol. having re-established several royal families that had lost their kingdoms (Gupta Inscriptions, p. 8). The Sukranitisāra (IV. 7-397-399 ) requires the conqueror to support the well-behaved son and the queen of the vanquished king or to give a fourth of the conquered kingdom to him and only go part of it to one who is not endowed with good qualities and the conqueror may appropriate the whole treasury of the conquered. 

The coronation of a king was a very solemn and important ceremony. Reasons of space forbid any lengthy treatment but something must be said about it. In the medieval text-books, various procedures are described from different sources. The Rājanitiprakasa (pp. 42-112 ), the Niti-mayükha (pp. 1-13) and the Rājadharmakaustubha (pp. 237-374), the Rāja. Dh. K. (II. pp. 6-10 ) quote procedures of coronation from the Ait. Br., the Gopatha Br., the Sāmavidhana Br., the Brahmapurana, the Vişnudharmottara and other works. The procedure from the Purānas probably originated when persons of the sūdra caste frequently became kings. The Rājanitiprakāśa 10+ (p. 112 ) says that there being different procedures of coronation rites based on Vedic texts, some hold, following the dictum of Sabara (on Jaimini II. 4.9 ), that the coronation rite should comprehend all the different items mentioned in the several vedic texts (provided they do not contradict each other), while others hold that there should be no comprehensive inclusion of all items but each vedic or smộti procedure should be followed separately by itself. Mitra misra concludes that the purohita should follow that course which is nearest to his own sākhā. The Rājadharmakaustubha (p. 339 ) says that as the rite described in the Vişnudharmottara contains the largest number of details, one who is able to do so, may follow that Purāna, while for those who cannot do so there is an option or students of the Rgveda may follow the Rgvidhāna mode, of the Sāmaveda the Sāmavidhāna Br. and all may follow the Purāņa mode of coronation. I shall first briefly indicate what procedure was followed in some vedic texts such as the Gopatha Brāhmaṇa, the Samavidhāna Br. and in the Gșhyasūtras, then point out what was done in the times of the

epios and set out the prominent items in the procedure of the purānas. 

The Aitareya Brālımana ( 38 ) describes the Great Corona tion of Indra (Aindra mihābhişeku) and in that connection mentions how the kings of the Sātvatas in the south were called 'Bhoja' after coronation, the kings of the eastern countries were called 'samrāt', the kings in the west were called 'svarāt' and the kings of the north i, e. of countries beyond the Himalaya (viz. Uttarakurus and Uttaramadras ) were called 'virāt'. Then (in 39 ) it states that the ksatriya king is to be made to take an oath and is to be crowned in the manner of the Aindra Maha bhişeka 15. The oath which the ksatriya is to take before the priest with faith is : 'the merit of sacrifices and good works that belongs to me from the night I was born up to the night on which I shall die, my worlds, good deeds, life, progeny,--these you may destroy if I hate ( or prove false to ) thee'. Vide note 41 above for the coronation oath in Sānti 59.106 ff. It will be noticed that this passage of the Ait. Br. contains no undertaking given by the king to the people to rule according to dharma or for their welfare. So this passage cannot strictly be interpreted as postula ting a contractual basis for the authority or power of the king, as done by Jayaswal( 'in Hindu Polity' part II p. 28). The Ait. Br, sets out the materials ( sambhāras ) for the coronation of a king (in chap. 39.2 ) viz. fruits of nyagrodha, udumbara, aśvattha and plakṣa trees, grains of small rice, large-sized rice, priyangu and barley, a couch of udumbara with span-long feet, a spoon with a four-cornered scooped bazin of udumbara and an udumbara vessel, on one of which two the other materials were to be placed and curds, honey, clarified butter and rain water gathered when the sun is shining. The mantras to be recited are mentioned in 39-3-4 and the fee in 39-6. In the Rājasūya (to be performed only by a ksatriya) described in the Brah manas and sūtras, the principal rite is the Abhişecaniya in which the king is bathed with waters brought from seventeen sources in seventeen vessels of udumbara wood. Vide H. Dh. vol. II. pp. 1216-1218 for the rito. The Rājanitiprakāśa (p. 92 107) explains the procedure of coronation from the Ait. Br. In the Rājasūya, among the preliminary rites are the offerings

called ratninām havimşi' (the offerings in the houses of the jewels, which are twelve). Vide H. Dh. vol. II pp. 1215-16. They have a symbolical value. The person to be crowned re cognizes the importance of his high functionaries and is declared to be their king and they are supposed to approve of him as king. In the Abhişecaniya rite of the Rajasūya, there are two parts, a religious and a popular. First, the adhvaryu and tho other priests sprinkle the king with holy water collected from various sources in vessels; then the king's brother, a friendly ksatriya and a vaisya also sprinkle him with the holy water. This last is symbolio of the popular approval of the coronation, 

The Tai. Br. II. 7. 15–17 deals with coronation. It first gives the seven mantras for seven ahutis that are offered. A tiger skin is spread on which the king is seated and he is sprinkled with holy water in which sprouts of barley and dūrvā grans are mixed up; the king ascends a chariot to the accom paniment of mantras, then the four wheels of the chariot are touched, the purohita and charioteer are addressed with man tras%3D Anumati, the Earth (as mother), and Heaven (as father) are implored to approve of the coronation, the king is made to look up towards the Sun and then the king looks on the sub jects; the king then undergoes shaving when seated on a chair of udumbara wood, then his arms and head are anointed with milk blended with clarified butter. 

The Nitimayakha. pp. 4-5, Rajanitiprakāsa pp. 42-43, Rajadharmakaustubha pp. 335-336 quote a passage from the Gopatha Brāhmaṇa 106 on the rites of coronation as follows: We shall expound the rite of the coronation of the king. Having

collected the materials required such as bilya fruit, viz. sixteen jars, sixteen bilva fruits, earth from an ant-hill, all kinds of husked grains, all liquids, and all kinds of grains (unhusked ). There should be four jars each of gold, silver, copper and clay. Having filled them, keeping their mouths up, with water from a deep reservoir of water or a lake to the accompaniment of the mantra "nāmaināma'(?) and having put the jars down on the surface of the altar, he ( the priest) should place one bilva fruit apiece in each of the 16 jars and cast (into the jars) the husked and unhusked grains and all fluids, adding them (to the water) in the golden jars with the mantras called Abhaya (Atharva veda 19.15), Aparajita, Āyuşya (Atharvaveda I. 30) and Svas tyayana 109 ( Atharvaveda I. 21, VII. 85. 1, VII. 86. 1, VII. 117.1), in the silver jars, with the mantras called samsrāvya (Atharva veda 19.1) and Samsiktiya (Atharyaveda II. 26), in the copper jars with the mantras called Bhaişajya (Atharva VII. 45' janad') and Amhomuc and in the earthen jars with Samveśa, Sam. vargya and Santātiya mantras and with the Prāna hymn (Atharvaveda XI. 4). He should then bathe the king with (the water of) the jars held by very holy and learned brāh maņas (śrotriyas). He should consecrate the king seated on the throne with the mantra (Atharvaveda IV. 22.1) 'O Indra, make this my ksatriya prosper'. (The king) being thus bathed should eat the several liquids, should make gifts of a thousand cows to the brahmana priests who assist the chief priest, bestow a good village on the chief priest. He (the king) thereby acquires great glory, enjoys the earth and always vanquishes his foes'.

The Sanayidhāna Brāhmaṇa 108 (III. 5) describes a shorter rite; "(The priest) should crown the king when the moon is in the Pusya or Sravana constellation. Having brought waters (separately in separate jars ) from famous holy rivers (like the Ganges) 109 and from the sea and having mixed in them rice, barley, sesame and māsa (black beans) grains and curds, honey, flowers and gold, he should bathe the king seated on an auspici ous throne made of udumbara wood on which is spread tiger-skin with the hair outside, from horn-pipes cut off from the horns of living cows to the accompaniment of the rahasya mantra 'abhrātsvyaḥ' (you are without an enemy &c., Rg. VIII. 21.13, Sāmaveda 399 and 1489). He should bathe the king to the accompaniment of the Ekavşşa hynin (instead of Rg. VIII. 21.13) whom he desires to be the sole ruler (of the earth) and whose circle of kings is desired by hiin not to be overwhelmed by an enemy. On the priest performing the coronation rite the king should bestow the best village, a hundred maid servants and a thousand cows and (the king) should be obedient to him (the officiating priest)". 

The Baud. Gșhyaģeşasūtra (I. 23) contains the procedure of coronation, the whole of which is quoted by the Balambhatti on the Mitākṣarā on Yāj. I. 309. It is briefly as follows:On the 5th or 13th tithi of the bright half when the moon is in Pusya or Sravana or in any other auspicious constellation ( nakşaıtra), two "brāhmaṇas are fed (the day previous). Then a worthy purohita is chosen, who mutters certain texts. At sunset the purohita makes a lotus-like circle in which are collected the materials viz. waters of the ocean and of rivers mixed with rice, barley, sesame, māsas and pañcagavya, and a bhadrūsana made of udumbara, a tiger-skin, and golden jars and horns of cows. In the north-east part of the palace, a homa is performed with eight thousand āhutis (oblations) of rice &c. to the accompani ment of the vyāhrtis, the Gāyatri and the mantra to Tryambaka

Coronation according to Baudhūyana 

(Tai. S. I. 8. 6. 2). The priest first propitiates the goddess Lakşmi with the hymn to Sri and then washes the crown with cow's urine and dung, milk, curds, clarified butter and with water mixed with kušas to the accompaniment of appropriate mantras, and ties an amulet (pratisara), and sprinkles the king and his conveyance (horse ). At sunrise next day (the day of coronation) the tiger-skin is spread on the throne, the king sits thereon facing the east, the priest takes the golden jars and sprinkles the king with water falling upon him from the cone like horns of cows with several mantras (such as those addressed to waters, Varuņa &c.). After the king is made to take a bath, a fee of a thousand nişkus and a hundred dūsis is paid to the brāhmaṇas. Then the crown is placed on his head and drums are beaten. 

The Kausikagātra of the Atharvaveda (in 17.1-10) des cribes the abhişeka ( called laghu ) performed on the Yuvarāja, Māndalika, Samanta and Senāpati and (in 17.11-34 ) describes the mahābhiseka of the king, 

In the Rāmāyana there are numerous references to corona tion. In the Yuddhakanda 131 we have a lengthy description of the coronation of Rāma. Some of the salient features are : Rāma was shaved that day, had a bath and put on costly clothes. Sitā also was suitably dressed and ornamented. Rāma sat in a chariot and went through the capital, when Bharata held the reins, Satrughna held the umbrella, Laksmana the white chourie; then Rāma rode an elephant; drums were beaten and conches were blown; as auspicious signs gold, cows, maidens, brāhmaṇas, men with sweetmeats in their hands passed in front of Rāma; the citizens had raised banners on every house; Jāmbavān, Hanuman and two others brought four jars full of sea-water and waters of five hundred rivers were brought 

110. The Vişnudharmottara (II. 128. 2-6) states that the hymn to Sri is different for each veda; the hymn of 15 verses beginning with 

Hiranyavarnim harinim' occurring in the parisista to the Rgveda is the one for Rgveda, the hymo of four verses beginning with ratbe aksesu vrsabhasya vāje' (Tai. Br. II, 7. 7) is the Srisūkta for the Yajurveda, the verse •şrāyagta iva' ( 267, 1319) for Samaveda aad 'sriyam dhātur mayi dehi' is the one for Atharvaveda. The Agnipurāna ( 237, 2-17) contains a hymn to Sri, which is not vedic but paurānic. Similarly the Rajadharma kaustubha (pp. 367-370) contains a long paurāoic hymn ( said to have been repeated by Indra ) to Sri which is to be recited while the king was to be seated on the throne after coronation. It is taken from the Vişnupurāna 1.9.

in jars; the aged Vasiştha, the family priest, seated Rāma and Sitā on a jewelled throne; Vasistha and other sages sprinkled Rāma with the holy and scented waters, then maidens, the ministers, soldiers, the guilds of merchants also sprinkled Rāma; Vasiştha placed an ancient crown on Rāma's head; there was dancing and singing ; Rāma gave presents to the priests and to his friends and to such helpers as Sugrīva, Angada, Bibhişaña and others and Sitā gave a necklace to Hanumān, In the Ayodhyākānda 15 we have a description of preparations for the abhişeka of Rāma as yuvarāja. The Raghuvamsa XVII. 10 mentions the coronation of Kuśa's son with waters of holy rivers ( tirthas) from golden jars. 

In the Mahābhārata also there are several references to and descriptions of coronation. Vide Sabhā 33 (where people of all castes including śūdras were invited at the Rājasūya, yv 41-42 ) for the coronation of Yudhisthira; Santi 40 (in verses 9-13 the materials for coronation are described ); Adi 44, 85, 101 (only references ). 

The sambhāras (materials required) of coronation are stated in the Pratimānātaka (I.1) ascribed to Bhāsa and in the Pañcatantra III (after verse 75). 

In the Agnipurāna, chap. 218 deals with coronation and chap. 219 sets out the mantras. The following are the principal items in the ceremony; bath (with water in which sesame and mustard are mixed ), seating on bhadrāsana, proclamation of abhaya (security and non-injury to all), releasing some prisoners from jail, Aindri sānti, fast by king, recital of mantras, sancti fying the head and other limbs of the king with earth taken from the top of a mountain and from other places, sprinkling pancagavya, sprinkling of water from four jars of gold, silver, copper and earth by amātyas of the four varnas, abhişeka by a Rgvedin with water mixed with honey, by Chandoga with water mixed with. kusa grass, by Yajurvedin and Atharvavedin brāhmaṇas touching king's head and throat with yellow pigment, singing and beating of musical instruments, holding of chowrie and fan before the king, king's looking into a mirror and clarified butter, worship of Vişnu and other gods, sitting on a tiger-skin below which there are four skins viz. of lion, cheeta, cat and bull; purohita to give madhuparka, to tie patta (a fillet or tiara ) round the king's head and to place the crown on his head; presentation of ministers by the pratihāra ;

king to give presents to the priests and other brāhmaṇas; going round fire ; doing obeisance to elders ; touching a bull; worshipping a cow with calf; riding a horse ; honouring an elephant and riding it; procession in the capital; honouring all people and taking leave of them. 

There are descriptions of the abhişeka of a yuvarāja (as of Bhima in Sānti 41 ), of a great commander (as of Bhişma in Udyogaparva 155,26-32 ), of Droņa in Dropaparva 5.39-43, of Skanda in Salyaparva 45. 

The Rājanitiprakāśa (pp. 49-83), the Rajadharma-kaustubha (pp. 318-363 ) and Nitimayükha pp. 1-4 quote from the Vişnu dharmottara almost the whole of chapters 21-22 of the 2nd khanda that deal with the rites and mantras of coronation. It appears that the Kaustubha appropriates all the glosses of Mitramiśra. The Visnudharmottara (11. 19 ) sets out first the Sānti (propitiatory ) rite in honour of Indra (called the Paurandari or Aindri Santi'). It is impossible to give the details here, but a few matters may be noticed. The purāna (in II. 21 ) includes all the details from the Vedic texts (such as Svastyayana, Āyuşya, Abhaya and Aparajita hymns) and adds other rites also. It mentions the procedure stated above from the Agnipurāna and employs Vedic mantras in doing so. In II. 22 the Visnudharmottara gives purāna mantras in 182 verses, in which such gods as Brahma, Naksatras (from Krttikā to Bharaņi), the planets, 14 Manus, 11 Rudras, Višve-Devas, Gandharvas and Apsarases, dānavas, dākinis, birds like Claruda, nāgas, sages like Veda-Vyāsa, emperors like Prthu, Dilipa, Bharata, vedas and vidyās, rivers &c, are invoked to crown the 

king. 

The Rājadharmakaustubha gives the most elaborate des cription of coronation. First a śānti rite is performed, then on the next (2nd) day, a sacrifice to Išana (Rudra); on the 3rd day worship of the planets and other deities like waters, the earth, Nārāyana, Indra &c. and the invocation of nakşatras; on the 4th day'a yāga for naksatras ; on the 5th day at night a sacrifice to the goddess Nirrti ( a clay idol seated on an ass with dark vesture ); on the sixth day Aindri Santi (propitiatory rite in honour of Indra); then the rites prescribed in the Vişnu dharmottara purāna, 

The Visnudharmottara notes (II. 18.2-4) that on the death of the reigning king, there is no waiting for an auspicious time.

The successor should be bathed with water in which sesame and mustard are mixed, proclamation should be issued in his name that he has succeeded as king, the purohita and astrologer should show him to the people while he occupies a seat other than that occupied by the late king : the king should honour the people, proclaim peace and security, set free some prisoners and wait for the formal coronation, The Rājanītiprakāśa (p. 62 ) adds that on the death of a king his successor should be crowned one year thereafter and that when a king abdicates his successor may be crowned on any auspicious day without waiting for a year. From the fact that the Kalinga king Khāravela was crowned in his 25th year and the fact that the Bārhaspatya sūtra "l(1. 89-90) states that up to the 25th year the prince may spend his time in play and education and then in earning wealth, Jayaswal (in ‘Hindu Polity' part II. p. 52 ) concludes that a Hindu coronation could not take place before the 25th year. This is proving too much. The Bārhaspatya-gütra says not a word about the age of coronation Authorities like the Visnu dharmottara require waiting for a year only after the death of the former king. 

The Visnudharmottara '18 (II. 7) specifies at great length the qualities of the principal queen ( agra-mahişi ), which are quoted by the Rājanitikaustubha pp. 249-250. The chief queen should have the coronation rite performed along with the king or she should be separately crowned after the king. Manu VII. 77 advises the king to marry a lady of noble family, of the same caste, of charming appearance and possessed of good 

qualities. The Rājatarangiņi (VIII. 82) notes that Jayamati, the queen of the good king Uccala of Kashmir (1101-1111 A, D.), always occupied half his throne. 

The Nitimayükha and Rajadharmakaustubha give tlie most detailed description of the Aindrl Santi. For want of space it has to be passed over. The Rājanitiprakāśa (pp. 63-66) and Rājadharmakaustubha (pp. 340-346 ) contain in one place a summary of the whole ceremony after Aindri Sānti commencing one day previous to the actual day of coronation.

Interesling coronulion rites 

rites is interesting, viz. after the learned brāhmaṇas and priests sprinkle the king with holy waters from soveral jars to the accompaniment of mantras and a Rgvedin brāhmaṇa touches the king's head and throat with powder of gorocanā with the mantra "gandhadvārām' (Tai. A. X. 1.10), principal virtuous ladies, whose song are alive, of the four varnas and also of mixed castes reciting auspicious songs (except the sūdra ladies who romain silent) should sprinkle the king with the waters derived from the sea and other holy places. "13 There is a graphic descrip tion of the coronation of Shivaji *13a the founder of the Maratha Empire in 1674 A. D. in the chronicle (bakluur) compiled by Krishnaji Anant Sabhasad (ed. by K. N. Sane, pp. 98-104), where it is said that a costly throne was prepared, from 108 places waters were brought in 108 golden jars (95 tirthas are actually named), Gāgābhatta and other brāhmanas officiated and sprinkled waters on the king, large gifts including the sixteen mahādānas were made. Eight ministers stood round the throne ( whose names and offices are set out), the head of the ecclesiastical department called Panditrao being to the right and the prime minister (mukhya pradhana ) to the left, an umbrella (chatra ) set with jewels was held over his head, new golden coins were struck and a new era was started called 'Rājyābhişoka'era commencing from that year. In a small work called 'Shivarāja-rājyābhişeka-kalpa taru '(published in the quarterly Journal of the Bhārata-itihāsa samsodhaka Mandala at Poona, vol. X part I pp. 28-40 ) in 236 verses it is stated that a Yogin named Niscalapurl, an adept in Tantrika rites, got a second coronation of Shivaji performed over three inonths aftor that perforined by Gāgābhatta, with Tāntrika mantras on Wednesday the 5th of the bright half of Āśvina sake 1596, one interesting fact stated being that Shivaji went through a form of marriage with vaidika mantras with his wives that had already been married to him with paurānic mantras,

The symbols of royalty viz. the umbrella, the chowries and the cane stick are brought in to the king by principal ministers. 

The Vişnudharmottara ( II. 12 ) states that the cāmara for the king must be made from the tails of camari deer and must be all white with a handle of gold or silver and that the one for a councillor or purohita should be yellowish, while the same purāņa in 11. 13 describes the requisites of a royal umbrella. That the umbrella and cāmaras were inseparable emblems of sovereignty is emphasized by Kālidāsa in Raghuvainsa III. 16. Vide the Bphatsamhitā, chap. 71 and 72, for cāmara and umbrella. 

It appears that sometimes a king took another name on coronation which was called abhisekanānu. Vide Dr. R. C. Majumdar's 'Champā' p. 157 for a list of such names from Champā and Dr. Minakshi's 'Administrative and social life under Pallavas' p. 39 for the Pallava Rājasiinha having the coronation name Narasimhavarman. Certain kings, when they performed Aśvamedha, assumed new titles e. g. Kumāragupta I seems to have assumed the title of Mahendra, as is clear from some of his coins on which his name and title occur. 

The Bṛhatsamhita of Varāhamihira (chap. 48) lays down that the patta (tiara ) for the king and others should be made of pure gold, that their length should be double of the breadth in the middle of it, that there should be five aigrettes in the king's tiara, three in the queen's and yuvarāja's, one in that of the commander-in-chief and none in the one that the king may give to a person as a mark of favour. Utpala in his com, on the Brhatuamhitā says that patta is the same as mukuta, while acc. to the Nitimayûkha (p. 13) and other works patta is tied on the forehead and mukuta (crown) is placed on the king's head. Vide Rājanitiprakāśa (pp. 54–55) and Rajadharmakaustubha (p. 324) for further details. The Visnudharmottara ( II. 14 ) describes the characteristics of bhadrāsana ( the throne ) for the king; vide also Rājanitiprakāsa pp. 51-52. It must be made of gold, silver or copper or a tree from which milky juice oozes when cut, it was to be one cubit and half high for a saināt, 14 cubit for a king and one cubit high for a feudatory (sāmanta). 

The Visnudharmottara (II. 162 ) states that on every anni. versary of the first coronation when the moon is in the same nakşatra as that on which the first coronation took place the king should repeat the rites of coronation. The Brahmapurāna

quoted by the R. D. K. (p. 10) also says the same. 113163 Vide Rājanitiprakāśa p. 115 and Kaustubha p. 379 also, 

Manu (VII. 217-220 ) warns the king against poisoning The king should partake of food that is well examined and prepared by servants that are trust-worthy (lit. as if they were his own self), that know the proper times (for dining), that cannot be won over and over the food spells destroying poison should have been muttered. He should mix up in all that he partakes medi cines that are antidotes against poison and should always wear gems that work against poison. Only women devoted to him and well examined and found safe as regards their dress and ornaments should be allowed to touch him when fanning or bath ing him or applying perfumes to his body. The king should take care in this way as regards his vehicles, bed, food, bath, applying perfumes and all ornamentation'. Kām. VII. 8 and Matsya 219.10 are very similar to Manu VII. 220. Kautilya (I. 17) states that the king should first secure his personal safety against his sons and wives and then the security of the kingdom against near and distant enemies. He first deals with safety from his own sons, the princes. The opinions of various authors on polity are cited (some of which have been noted above) viz. secret punishment (acc. to Bhāradvāja), keeping under guard in one place ( acc. to Viśālākşa ), keeping the prince in a fort under the boundary guard (acc. to the Pārāśaras), keep ing the prince away from his own kingdom in a fort belonging to a feudatory (acc. to Piśuna), sending him to his maternal re lations (acc. to Kauņapadanta), making the prince addicted to sensual pleasures (acc. to Vātavyādhi), proper pre-natal care and proper education after birth about dharma and restraint (acc. to Kaut.). This symposium shows how the problem of the king's safety against bad princes taxed the ingenuity of all ancient writers on Arthaśāstra and how Kautilya advocated the only reasonable course possible. The Matsyapurāņa, chap. 220, also relies on training, discipline and gradual transfer of responsibility and advises the imprisonment of a bad prince in a well-guarded place furnished with comforts suitable to his

position ! In I. 20 Kautilya gives practical hints against the danger of fire and poisons : e. g. he says that poisonous snakes will not enter a building provided with Jivanti, Sveta and other plants; that cats, peacocks, mongoose and spotted deer when let loose eat serpents, that certain birds like parrots, mainus, malbar bird shiriek when they suspect snake poison, the heron loses his consciousness in the vicinity of poison; the pheasant (jivan jivaka) feels exhausted; the young cuckoo dies; the eyes of cukor become redder's Kām. (VII. 10-13) repeats the words of Kauţ, 1.20 and the Matsya (219, 17-22) refers to the effects of poison on the same birds and a few others. The Matsyapurana in chap. 219-220 closely follows Kaut. and Kān. and appears to be based on them (e. g. Matsya 219. 30 latter half is the same as Kām. VII. 24 first half). Vide Yaśastilaka III. pp. 511-512 for the effects of poison on birds almost in the same words as those of Kaut. and Kām. Vide Sukra I. 326-328. Kaut. I. 21, Kāni. VII. 15-26, Matsya 219. 9-32 state that part of the food for the king should first be cast into fire and offered to birds and the effects noted, they dwell at great length on the different tints of the flames of fire and of the smoke when different kinds of food are cast into fire, they point out the actions and ges tures of the poisoner, they prescribe that the cook and the doctor giving medicines for mixing in food as antidotes should be made to partake of the food and then the king should himself partake of it. The king has to be careful in the harem, when receiving presents or anything sent by others, when sitting in a conveyance or riding a horse or travelling in a boat or when attending festivals (Kaut. I. 20-21, Kām. VII. 28-47). Kaut. 1.20 and Kān. (VII. 44 and 50) advise the king not to trust women and even the queen and to approach even the queen after she has been examined by men 80 years old and women over 50

Kings killed by stratagens

years in the larem and found 18 safe. Kaut. (I. 20) and Kām. (VII. 51-54) both name seven kings that met death in their queen's chambers by the stratagems of the queens themselves or those that were incited by them; viz. Bhadrasena killed by his brother concealed in the chamber of his queen (who was in love with the king's brother), the king of Karüşa killed by his own son who had concealed himself under the bed of the queen (who was angered by the king's promise to give the kingdom to the son of a rival queen), the king of Kāśi killed by his queen who mixed fried rice with poison pretending that it was huney; the queen of the king of Sauvira killed him with a jewel in her girdle that was smeared with poison; Vairantya was killed by his queen with her anklet smeared with poison; Jalūtha (or Jarūsa in Kām.) was killed with a mirror (with a razor-like edge) covered with poison; Vidūratha was killed by his queen who had concealed a weapon in her braided hair. The Harşa carita (VI) of Bāna mentions with additional details the cases of Bhadrasena king of Kalinga killed by his brother Virasena, the king of Karūsa ( Dadhra by name), Kāśirāja (named Mahā ssena) whose queen Suprabhā killed him to secure the kingdom tu her son, Jarūtha king of Ayodhyā, Vairantya named Rantideva, Viduratha of the Vrsnis killed by Bindumati, the Sauvira king Virasena killed by queen Hamsavati. In the Brhatsamhita (77. 1-2) two of these, Vidūratha and Kāśirāja, are mentioned, but the latter is said to have been killed by his estranged queen with an anklet smeared with poison. Medhātithi on Manu VII. 153 quotes four of these seven. The Nitivākyāmsta (raja raksāsamuddeśa 35-36, pp. 231-232) sets out six other examples of kings killed by their queens. The king has also to beware of treachery from ministers and officials. Kaut. (in I. 10) des. cribes how ancient writers devised methods of ascertaining the purity or impurity of ministers by putting before them allure. ments regarding dharma, wealth, sexual desires and playing on their fears and gives it as his own opinion that temptations that have direct reference to the king or queen should not be placed in the way of the ministers.

gupta, the commander of the elephant arm of Harsa's army, warns the Emperor against putting trust in everybody and gives 19 instances of kings that met misfortunes, death or des truction through their own carelessness and the stratagems of those about them (apart from the seven mentioned above and two more who fell victims to the wiles of their queens). Some of them are famous and deserve mention here, viz. the king of Vatsa (i. e. Udayana ) who was imprisoned by the soldiers of Mahāsena that jumped out of a faked elephant; Maurya Brhadratha killed by his Senāpati Puşyamitra (called 'anārya' by Bāņa on account of his treachery to his master); Kakavarna Saišunāri (Šaisunāgi?), Sumitra, son of Agnimitra, whose head was cut off by Mitradeva while the king fond of dancing was in the midst of actors ; the Sunga Devabhūti killed by his minister Vasudeva; Candra gupta (of the Gupta dynasty ) who dressed as a charming woman cut off the king of Sakas; the foolish Maukhari king Ksatra varman killed by bards. Vide Kamagūtra V. 5.30 for two other examples of the Abhira king Kottaraja and Jayatsena king of Kāsi. The Nitivākyāmộta (Dūtasamuddeśa) p. 171 states that Canakya killed one of the Nandas through a data and that two other kings met death from presents of poisoned clothes and a jewelled box containing snake poison. The Yasastilakacampū (III. pp. 431-432) sets out many instances of kings that met with death from the wrath or the machinations of their ministers, purohita &c. 

From these examples one should not draw the facile and gweeping conclusion that in India the life of no king was safe. In the vast continent of India there were always numerous king doms at the same time. It is no wonder that in the course of several thousand years and over such vast territories, some kings met death by treachery and stratagem. This is not a phenomenon restricted to India. In a small country like England we have within two hundred years instances of the murder of the boy king Edward V and his brother prince Richard, of Lady Jane Grey nominated by Edward VI as his successor and the further fact that Cromwell during the last few months of his life was afraid of being assassinated. During about 150 years froin 1789 out of 30 Presidents of the U.S. A. several such as Lincoln, Garfield and McKinley met death at the hands of assassins. 

The truth is that in a monarchy the king was the pivot of the whole State. As the Matsyapurāna ( 219.34 ) finely puts it 

III ] 

Hereditary neonarchy 

87 

* the king was the root and the subjects were the treo ; in saving the king from dangers the whole kingdom was on the road to prosperity and therefore all were to make efforts to guard the king. 

Hereditary monarchy was the norm of government in ancient and medieval India. Kautilya expressly states (I. 17 at ond) that the practice to make the eldest son the king is honoured except in the case of a calamity. At or about the time of Buddha and a few centuries thereafter there were a few oligarchies or (as some scholars prefer to call them ) republics. But our Dharmaśāstra or Arthasāstra authorities contain rather very meagre references to them. The Mahābhārata in Santi 107 furnishes the following data about .ganarājyas (government by groups ) : Internal dissensions are the root of the ruin of ganas; it is very difficult to keep lines of policy secret when there are many (when the government is that of many, i.e. an oligarchy or a republic); all members of the gana in their entirety do not deserve to hear the line of policy decided upon, but the chief persons among the gaņas should meet together and arrange among themselves to secure the welfare of the whole gana; if disputes that arise among the families (or clans) are connived at by the heads of the clan, the ruin of the clan takes place which leads on to dissensions among the whole group (gana ). Danger from internal dissensions must be guarded against (in thie case of ganarājya ), external dangers are not serious ( in the case of ganarājya). All members of the gana are equal by birth and family, but they are not equal in energy, intelligence, bodily appearance and wealth. By their enemies ganas are broken by means of internal dissensions and bribes; therefore the greatest safety of ganas lies in union '17. In these words the author of the Mahābhārata unerringly puts his finger on the weak spots of the rule of many viz. secrecy cannot be kept, there is corruption due to greed and jealousy, which bring about their downfall. In another place (Sānti 81 ) the Mahabharata

refers to the ruingha of the Vrsnis, of whom Krsna was the presi dent, and the great truth that the ruin of sanglia:3 is brought about by internal dissensions and corruption and it hits off the qualities required in the wise leader of the sangha to be four viz. sagacity, forbearance, self-control and giving up the acqui sitive spirit. The words sangha and saņa are employed as synonyms in the Mahābhārata. Pāṇini (III. 3.86 ) states that sunyha means gana. Patañjali in his Mahābhāşya ( vol. II. p. 356) states that sangha, samūlu and samudāyn mean the same thing. Pāṇini knows two kinds of sanghas viz, ayudhajivin (who practis od the profession of arms) and those that were not go and further he also indicates that in the Vāhika country sanghas included 118 brāhmanas, ksatriyas and others ( vide V.3. 114). He names the sanghag of Vṛkas, Trigartas, Yaudheyas, Parsus (V. 3.115-117 ) as āyudluijivin. Kātyāyana by his vārtiku * kşatriyadekarājāt sanghapratişedhārtham' on Panini IV. 1.168 shows that sangha was differentiated from monarchy. Acc. to Kautilya (p. 53 above ) the sangha of the Vrsnis perished when it came in conflict with Dvaipāyana. In another place Kautilya says that (in some cases ) the kingdom may be ruled by a clan, for the confederacy 19 of a clan is invincible, it is free from the calamity of a kingless State and therefore exists on the earth very long. Kautilya devotes one section (Adhikarana XI) to the dealings of the ambitious king with sanghas. There he states that securing the sangha on one's side is far better tlian securing an army or allies and makes the most interesting remark 18? that the corporation of the kşatriyas and others in

In chap. 44. 10 it is stated that their chief city is Sākala and in verses 11-30 and 35-38 their condemned practices are set out, and verses 31-34 say that the country of the five rivers is called Āratta and Vāhika. In Karnaparva 45, 6-13 the interesting fact is mentioned that in that country only one brother in a family acts as a brāhmana should and that their sons do not inherit but their sister's sons take the inheritance.

the countries of Kāmbhoja and Surāstra practise vürtü (husbandry and trade ) and the profession of arms, while those of the Licchivikas, Výjikas, Mallakas, Madrakas, Kukurai, Kurus and Pāñcālas live on the title of rājan applied to them (i. c. they are not cultivators of the soil and soldiers, but are only chiefs or nobles). What Kautilya means by "vārtā-sastropa jivinah' appears to be that they were agriculturists ordinarily but were ready with their swords to defend their country when occa:ion required. Kautilya then describes in detail without any scruples how the conqueror may by various subterfuges cause dissensions among the members of the sangha and its leader or leaders (sanylur-mukhya). In VIII. 3 Kautilya remarks that dissension becomes particularly rife owing to gambling among sanghas and noble clans that have the sangha constitution and they are destroyed. From about the 5th or 6th century A. D. the oligarchic States or Republics became rare and gradually disappeared. We get further data about these ganarājyas from Buddhist works, Greek sources (like the fragments of Megasthenes), coins and inscriptions. Rudradāman ( in Junagadh Inscription of 150 A, D.) boasts that he had uprooted the Yaudheyas who had become puffed up and unbending on account of the title of heroes (vira) that was prominently applied to them among all ksatriyas 181 (E. I. vol. VIII. at p. 44). Samudragupta ( in the first half of the 4th century A. D.) subjugated the Yaudheyas, Mālavas, Arjunayanas &c. In Gupta Inscriptions No. 58 p. 251 there is mention of a mahārāja-mahūsenāpati who was made their leader by the Yaudlieya-gaņa. The Bphatsamhita in several places refers to the Yaudleyas and Arjunāyanas (e. g. 4.25 ; 5.40, 67, 75; 14.25 and 28; 16.21 ; 17,19 ) and speaks of Yaudheya-nộpa in 9.11. Vide Rapson's 'Indian coins' pp. 11 and 15 and Plate II, nos. 13-15 and Plate Ill, no. 20 for the coins of the Yaudheyas and Arjuna yanas. Arrian writes in 'Indika' (tr. by MacCrindle IX. p. 208, ed. of 1926 ) 'from Dionysus to Sandrakottos the Indians counted 153 kings and a period of 6042 years, but among them a republic was thrice established'. MacCrindle's 'Invasion of India' (p. 121 ) speaks of an aristocratic government on the

Hyphasis or Beas. The Greek writers describing the invasion 

of Alexander speak of the democracies of the Oxydrakai (Ksudrakas), Malloi (the Mālavas), the Siboi (Sibis), Sambastai (the Ambasthas) and several others. Vide K. P, Jayaswal's "Hindu Polity' part I. chap. VIII (pp. 63–79) for Hindu Repub lics mentioned in Greek writings. Rhys Davids in 'Buddhist India' pp. 19 ff. summarizes the data about Indian republics derived from Buddhist works. On p. 22 he gives the names of eleven republican clans with their capitals, some of which like the Sakyas (of Kapilavastu ), the Mallas (of Kusināra and Pāvā), the Videhas (of Mithilā) and Licchavis (of Vesāli) are well known. Rhys Davids states (p. 19) that the administrative and judicial business of the Sakyas was carried on in a mote-hall (santhāgāra) at Kapilavastu, that a single chief was chosen (but how and for what period is not known) who presided over the sessions and (when no sessions were being held) also over the State, that he bore the title of rūjā. He mentions that at one time Buddha's cousin Bhaddiya was rājā and that in another passage Buddha's father Suddhodana is styled rājā. He further points out (p. 26) that the Vajjians had eight confederate clans of which the Licchavis and the Videhas were the most impor tant. K. P. Jayaswal in 'Hindu Polity' part I pp. 25-165 brings together all the data about Hindu oligarchies (or repub lics as he calls them) and his work deserves the serious atten tion of all those who are interested in the study of ancient Indian political institutions, though here and there one cannot approve of his interpretations and theories. To take only one example, he holds that the procedure prescribed by Buddha for the deliberations of the sangha in the Mahāparinibbāņa-sutta was borrowed from the procedure followed by the republics in their deliberations and therefore he describes the procedure of the Buddhist sangha in great detail ('Hindu Polity,' part I chap. XI pp. 103-117). Dr. D. R. Bhandarkar also (in 'Some Aspects of Ancient Hindu Polity' pp. 121-125 ) adopts this theory. This to say the least is a gratuitous assumption. The mere fact that Buddha told the prime minister of Ajātaśatru, king of Magadlia, who contemplated attacking the Vajjian confederacy, that the latter would not decline but prosper as long as they observed seven conditions and the fact that those very seven conditions were prescribed by the Buddha for the welfare of the sangha do not lead on to the further inference that the procedure followed by the monks in the deliberations of the meeting of the sangha (which is set out in such passages as the Mahavagga IX. 3, S.B.E. 

DI) . Procedure nf oligarchic assemblies 

Whir gesemblies 

91 

vol. XVII p. 264 ff, Cullavagga IV. 9, S. B. E, vol. XX pp. 24-27) was the procedure of the meetings of the oligarchies. The seven conditions (both for the welfare of the Vajjians and the Sangha) are set out in the Mahāparinibbāņa-sutta, chap. I. (8. B. E. vol. XI. pp. 3-8) viz. holding full and frequent public assem blies, meeting together in concord and carrying out undertakings in concord, enacting nothing not already established and abro gating nothing that has been already enacted and acting in accordance with ancient institutions established in former days, honouring and revering and supporting elders and hearkening to their words, not detaining women or girls of their clans by force or abduction, honouring and supporting Vajjian shrines in town or country and not allowing proper offerings and ritos to fall into deguetude, protecting and supporting the Arahats among them. On the most important points in connection with a republic or oligarchy we have no information at all, viz. who were entitled to vote, what were the qualifications for membership of the assenibly, that governed the State, how voting took place, what was the period for which mem bers of the assembly were elected, whether the president was elected for life or a shorter period or was elected at all, what were the powers and procedure of the assembly, Vide Dr. Beni Prasad in 'Hindu Political Theories' p. 158 for criticisms. Rhys Davids ( in ' Buddhist India' p. 41 ) says that according to the Jātakas there were at Vesāli (modern Basadh in the Muzaffarpur District ), the capital of the Licchavis, 7707 rājās (or chiefs). In the Bhaddasāla-jātaka (Fausböll, vol. IV p. 148) there is a reference to a tank reserved for the bath of the families of the ruling chiefs ( rājās ) of the gana in the city of Vesāli. In the Mahāvastu ( ed. by Senart vol. I. p. 271) it is stated that there were twice eighty-four thousand nobles (rājānā) among the Licchavis. This explains what Kautilya means by * rājaśabdopajivinaḥ. These people called ' rājās' were probably the scions of the several branches of the Licchavis, who had in their hands the government and who were not doing manual (or agricultural ) work. Vide Government Epigraphic Report for 1899 p. 23 and Indian Historical Quarterly vol. IV p. 652, where it is said that in an inscription from Uttaramallur the extent of land and of Vedic learning required in a candidate for elec tion are specified as also the method of writing on tickets the names of candidates. But such records, even in South India, are very few and refer to village sabhas and there is nothing in the works on dharmaśāstra or arthaśāstra about the methods of92

Another important question is whether in monarchical states there were popular assemblies of elected representatives or, in modern language, Parliaments. The words 'sabha' and 'samiti' require consideration in this connection. In Rg. I. 91.20 Soma is said to confer a son who is sādanya, ridathya and sableya, from which it follows that sabha is in some respects different from 

vidatha'. In Rg. II. 24. 13 a vipra (a priest or composer of hymns) is said to be sabheya 'clever or eminent in a sabhā'. In Rg. X. 34. 6 'sabhā' 12% appears to mean a gambling hall. In Vāj. S. XXX. 6 sabhācara seems to mean only 'sabhāgad', a mem ber of a judicial tribunal, while in XXX. 18 the sabhāsthanu is given up to Askanda in the symbolic Puruşamedha. In the Vāj. S. XVI. 24 there is an obeisance to sublās and subhāpatis (presidents of sabhās). In Atharvaveda VII. 12. 1 'sabhā' and 'samiti' are said to be the two daughters of Prajāpati, from which it may by argued that they were very similar but somewhat different. In Atharva veda XV. 9.2 also sabhā and samiti are separately mentioned. In Tai. Br. III. 7,4, the word sabhāpāla occurs and sabhā is explained as gambling-hall' by Sāyapa. In Rg. X. 97.6 and Vāj. S. XII. 80 it is said that vipra is said to be a doctor (bhisak) in whom medicinal herbs come together as nobles ( rājānah) in a samili (meeting or battle)'. In Rg. X. 191. 3 the word "samiti' seems to mean no more than a meeting or meeting place. In Atharvaveda V.19.15183 we have the assembly (samiti) does not suit him (or is not won over by him ) who harasses a brāhmaṇa'. In the Chāndogya Up, (V.3.1) Svetaketu is said to have repaired to the assembly (simiti) of the Pañcāla country, where the king Pravāhana Jaivali asked him five questions which the former could not answer and then he approached the next morning the king who was in his sabhā. Here it seems that both words are applied to the same assembly. It is impossible to say how the sabhā or samiti was constituted in the Vedic period. All that we can say is that it was an assembly of people to which the king, learned men and others went. It is extremely doubtful whether it was an elective body, Probably it was an ad hoc assembly of such people as cared to

Meaning of sabha and samiti 

be present. K. P. Jayaswal ( in 'Hindu Polity' part I p. 11 ) holds that 'samiti' in the vedic age was the national assembly of the whole people, that it was the king's duty to attend it (ind. p. 12 ) and that'sabba' was the standing and stationary body of selected men working under the authority of the samiti (ibill. p. 18)'. This is all conjectural, as Jayaswal himself admits 'the sabhū was certainly related to the samiti, but its exact relationship is not deducible from the data available' (ibid. p. 18). 

These frantic efforts by such scholars as Jayaswal to prove that India had elective assemblies are made to counteract the sinister propaganda of many English writers that East is East and West is West and that the democratic institutions of the West cannot be transplanted with success on the soil of India. This is mischievous propaganda. There were no democracies even in Europe a few hundred years ago; even in England, France and a few other countries democraciey have been intro duced and have thrived within a short time. There is no reason why they should not do so in India, if honest efforts are made and difficulties are not purposely created by vested interests. Korkunov in 'General theory of law'(tr. by Hastings, 1922, New York p. 296 ) says. According to the historical school the political organization of England is good for England alone, for it corresponds to a natural genius very peculiar.... This doctrine of the historical school is false, since we have already seen that a change produced in the social ideal may bring about a change in the whole social development. The influence of une people on the life of another is a proof of this. The ideal is a force supporting the social life and this ideal may be the result not merely of our own special experience, but also of the experience of neighbouring peoples '. 

Two other words require consideration, viz. Paura and Jūnapada. The word 'paura' occurs in Rg. V. 74, 4 where it has three applications, viz. to the Aśvins, to the sage Paura ( who was an Atreya) and to the cloud (acc. to Sāyana ). K. P. Jayaswal ( in 'Hindu Polity', part II pp. 60-108 ) devotes considerable space to 'Paura' and 'Jānapada' and one may at unce admit that he displays great learning, industry and ingenuity in his discourse on this subject. He holds that the Paura and the Jānapada were elective parliamentary bodies or what may be called the Hindu Diet and he sums up (on p. 108 ) their functions as follows 'we had an organism or a twin 

History of Dharmasāstra 

[ Vol. 

organism, the Paura Jānapada, which could depose the king, who nominated the successor to the throne ..., whose President was apprised by the king of the policy of state decided upon in the council of ministers, who were approached and begged by the king in all humility for a new tax, whose confidence in a minister was regarded as an essential qualification for his appointment as Chancellor, who demanded and got industrial, commercial and financial privileges for the country, who could enact statutes even hostile to the king, in fine who could make possible or impossible the administration of the king.' This is a very glowing picture of parliamentary institutions in ancient India. But unfortunately it cannot be accepted as the truth. Many scholars such as Prof. B. K. Sarkar ( in ' Political Institutions and theories of the Hindus' p. 71 ) and Dr. Beni Prasad ( in 'The State in ancient India' pp. 498-500 ) do not subscribe to this theory. For want of space detailed examina tion of Jayaswal's theory cannot be entered upon. But a few remarks must be made. The sheet anchor of his theory (in ‘Hindu Polity' part II. p. 68) is a passage in the Hāthigumpha Inscription of Khārvela (E. I. vol. XX at p.79 11.6–7) which runs "Rājasūyam samdasayamto sava-kara-vanam anugaha-anekāni satasahasāni visajati poram jānapadam' and which he himself translates ( at p. 78 ) as 'remits all tithes and cesses, bestows many privileges amounting to hundreds of thousands on the paura and jānapada'. Jayaswal himself has changed his views about the interpretation of this difficult record so many times (e. g. J. B. O. R. S. vol. III pp. 425-507 may be compared with his interpretations in E. I. vol. XX p.71 ) that one can never feel sure even of his latest readings and translations. As a matter of fact Dr." Barua differs and reads 'pora-jānapadam' as one word (I. H. Q. vol. 14 p. 464 ) and does not accept Jayaswal's interpretation (p. 477). If the word is 'pora-jānapadam' it would simply be a samāhāra-rivanda compound and mean "all inhabitants of the capital and the rural inhabitants.' and the singular need not necessarily lead to the inference that a parliament of city-dwellers and rural population is meant Even supposing that the correct reading is poram-jang padam.. that would not matter much. We shall have to understand the word janam' after it, since the word 'jana' is often employed after paurajānapada' e. g. in the 8th Rock Ediot at Girnar * janapadasa ca janasa dasanam' C.II. vol. I. pp. 14–15, in Rudradāman's inscription in E. I. vol. VIII p. 44 'apidayitvā paura-jānapadam janam' and 'paurajānapada-janānugrahārtham'

at p. 45 or in the Rāmāyana II. 2.51, II. 111. 19 'paurajā napadam janam'). Lastly if the paurajānapada organization had (as said by Jayaswal in the quotation cited above) the power to depose kings and pass even hostile statutes, is it not a contradic tion in terms to say that, instead of the Parliament or Diet deciding to remit certain taxes, it was the king who remitted taxes and bestowed favours (or privileges ) of lakhs of rupees on the supposedly all powerful Paura-Jānapada assembly? In all passages that he quotes from the Rāmāyana and other classical sanskrit works the ordinary meaning of puura ( residents of the capital ) and jānapuda ( inhabitants of the country other than the capital ) is quite enough and it is impossible to hold that any elective body is meant. In most passages the plural 'paura jānapadān' is used. If Paura-jānapada' stands for one elective body or two bodies, no explanation is offered why the plural should generally be used and not the dual. Kautilya (I. 19) states that the king should in the 2nd part of the day (divided into eight parts ) look into the causes of the paura-jānapadas. Jayaswal (in 'Hindu Polity', part II p. 95 ) misinterprets this passage by saying that the king had to set apart one period daily for the business of the paura-jānapada assembly. Here again the plural is used and the dictum of Kautilya is the same as that of Yāj. I. 327 who says that the king should look into the law-suits (vyavahārān) of the people. The word "kārya' is employed by Manu VIII. 43, Nārada and other writers on vyavahāra in the sense of 'law-suit'. Yāj. II. 36 says that the king should restore to the jānapada property stolen by thieves. Jayaswal ( in 'Hindu Polity', part II. p. 93 ) presses the singular 

jānapadāya' into his service and holds that it was the popular assembly that demanded the restoration of the things stolen. This, to say the least, is twisting the plain words of Yāj. The Mit. paraphrases the word to mean 'to the person dwelling in his country from whom the property was stolen'. The corren ponding passage of Manu VIII. 40 ( dātavyain sarva-varnebhyo rājñā corair-hstam dhanam) is quite clear, since it fortunately does not use the word jānapada and Medhātithi explains it as 'it should be restored to those from whom it was stolen'. Jayaswal (in Hindu Polity' part II p. 79 ) holds that a passage in the Arthasāstra (II. 14 ) refers to the fact that the Paura-Jānapada assembly got gold coins minted by the royal mint-master. 184 

124. raforaltaragrat Corvo TustinTH: Free frontare 9811 HUT II. 14.

I Vol. 

But the plain meaning is that the mint-master was to mint standard silver and gold coins for all people when they brought bullion to him to have coins struck. One striking circumstance to be considered is that, though in all works on polity a rajya is said to have seven elements, none of them includes a political elective assembly (like the paura-jānapada postulated by Jayaswal) among them. They only enumerate the country and the capital and declare even these as of lesser importance than the king and the ministers. Another matter that makes the existence of powerful elective political assemblies in monarchies most unlikely is the total absence of any reference in works on polity to the method of election, the system of voting, the qualifica tions of members, the period for which the assembly was elected and allied matters. When medieval writers like Aparārka on Yāj. II. 1 (p. 600 ) quote from Bṛhaspati versos about four kinds of sabhā, they refer only to judicial tribunals of various sorts and grades ( the same verses are quoted as Hārita's in Rājaniti ratnākara p. 20). Vide n. 368 below. 

If elective popular assemblies did not exist, then it may be asked whether the king was an absolute monarch or a despot or whether there were any checks that mitigated or regulated the power and doings of monarchs. The answer is that there were such checks and limitations. These were of various kinds. Exhortations addressed to the king himself exercised a restrain ing influence. For example, Kāt, (10) says 'the king who gives way to wrath without proper thought would reside in a liorrible hell for half a Kalpa'. The importance of dharma as an all enibracing institution was impressed upon the king by our writers so frequently that it must have had its psychological effect on every king. The idea that danda personified as a Deity might strike down the bad king himself (Manu VII. 19, 27, 28, 30, Yaj. I. 354-356 ) would tend to keep even a whimsical king within bounds. The views of ancient writers have already been cited according to which the king was not to act as he pleas ed, but was to regard his high office as a sacred trust and was to rule according to the dictates of the śāstras. These views created public opinion which must have certainly influenced the king's acts. The ideal king Rāma is depicted as having abandoned his queen Sita ( whom he knew to be pure ) because the people could not accept her as pure after her long stay in Rāvana's prison. Vide Rāmāyaṇa VII. 45. Then there were the ministers whose advice the king was enjoined to seek. Besides there was the purohita and there were learned brāhmaṇas,

who were to propound what dharma was, whose directions he was to carry out and who were supposed to have power to ruin a bad king (vide Vas. I. 39-41, Gautama XI. 12-14, Manu IX. 320). Vide H. of Dh. vol. II. pp. 138-145 for the peculiar sanctity attaching to the person of a brāhmaṇa and the superior position of brāhmaṇas as a class vis-a-vis the king. There was a deep rooted faith that the rules of the śāstras ( the Srauta and Smārta dharma ) were divinely inspired and were above the king, Observance of dharma was the great social and political ideal from very ancient times for all including the king. This is most emphatically put in the Bș. Up. I. 4. 11-14, where it is stated " even after creating the four varnas He ( the Creator) did not think that stability had been attained. He then created the most excellent Dharma which is the might of the mighty ( i. e. more powerful than the warrior caste ). There is nothing higher than dharma. Even a very weak man hopes to prevail over a very strong man on the strength of dharma, just as (he prevails over a wrong-doer ) with the help of the king. So what is called dharma is really truth. Therefore people say about a man who declares the truth that he is declaring dharma and about one who declares what dharma is they say that he speaks the truth. These two (dharma and truth) are this " (i. e. one). 145 Kāmandaka I. 14 stated that the Yavana king ruled over the earth for a long time because he ruled according to the dictates of dharma. In his administration of justice the king was to be checked by the judge and sabhyas, who were fearlessly to render advice to the erring king (as will be shown in the section on vyavahāra). Besides corporations and guilds were powerful and had a sort of self-government. Manu (VIII. 336 and Yaj. I. 307) went so far as to prescribe a heavy fine which the king was to inflict on himself for his illegal exactions and punishments and to direct that the king should distribute among brāhmanas wealth forfeited by grave sinners (Manu IX. 243-244). Lastly there was the final sanction that the śāstras allowed the subjects to abandon a worthlegs king or even to kill a misguided one or tyrant, as stated above (vide Manu VII. 27-28, Arthaśāstra I. 4).128

(Vol. 

Kautilya (VIII. 3) when dealing 127 with the evil results of want of discipline in a king states that kings who are hot tempered are known to have fallen victims to popular fury (or the fury of ministers ). We may say that in theory and so far as ordinary people were concerned the sovereign's power was absolute and unlimited as Manu IX. 9-12 aptly illustrate and as Bphat Parāśara states 'the king is Brahma, Siva, Vişnu, Indra, he is the giver, the destroyer, and the enforcer according to the karma of his subjects'. But there were ( as stated above) very real checks and limitations that effectively prevented him from exer cising his undoubtedly unlimited powers. These checks, though real, cannot be called constitutional in the sense in which that word is used in modern times. As said by Nārada the subjects are dependent while the king is uncontrolled, but he could not go against the śāstra ( vide Haradatta on Gaut. XI. 2). 

In modern times the activities of a sovereign person are three-fold, viz. executive, judicial and legislative. The judicial activities of the ancient Indian king will be dealt with in another section on law and the administration of justice. One great difference between ancient and modern societies is that the legislative action of the king was extremely limited in ancient times, while in modern times people are more and more looking to legislation for regulating all manner of things. Manu (VII. 13 ) lays down that since the king has in him the glory of all deities, whatever rule as regards desirable matters the king establishes and whatever action he declares as un desirable among those actions that are harmful, should not be transgressed by any one. ' In his gloss on this verse Medhātithi carefully points out what orders the king can issue and on what subjects he cannot issue orders. He gives the following inst ances of orders of both kinds: 'To-day all should observe a festival in the capital; all should attend a marriage ceremony at the house of the minister; animals should not be killed to-day by the butchers and birds should not be caught; debtors should not be harassed by creditors on these days ( to be specified); no one should associate with such and such a man (an undesirable person); no one should allow a certain (undesirable) person to enter the house'. Medhātithi adds that the king is not authorised to interfere with the gastric rules governing the

varņas and āśramas such as the performance of agnihotra. 147a This gloss of Medhātithi occurs word for word in the Rājaniti. prakāśa (pp. 23-24 ), which gives a more correct text than the printed editions of Mandlik and Gharpure. Kautilya (II. 10) devotes a chapter to the drawing up of śāsanas, particularly with reference to their linguistic elegance and diplomatic etiquette. The Sukranitisāra (1.312-313) prescribes that the king's edicts ( sāsana ) should be proclaimed to the subjects by beat of drum, that his edicts should be written and displayed where four roads meet, and that the king should declare that breaches of the orders would entail heavy fines. In I. 292-311 Sukra gives instances of such orders, the most important of which are: Watchmen should take rounds in the several streets every one hour and a half at night in order to prevent thieves and paramours moving about; people should not employ abuse or beating towards their slave, servant, wife, son or pupil; no one should practise deceit in respect of measures, weights, coins, resins, metals, ghee, honey, milk, fat, flour; no document should be got by force ; no bribes should be taken nor should any bribes be given to persons engaged in doing the king's work; no one should offer shelter to bad characters, thieves, paramours, those who hate the king, the enemy; parents, persons worthy of honour, learned men, men of good character should not be disrespected or ridiculed; no dissensions should he sown between husband and wife, master and servant, between brothers, between teacher and pupil, between father and son; no interference or obstruction should be caused to wells, parks, boundaries, dharnuuśālās, temples, roads or to those who are deficient in a limb; without the king's permission no one should engage in gambling, selling liquor, hunting, bearing arms, sale or purchase of cattle or elephants or horses or camels or she-buffaloes or slaves or immoveable property or silver, gold, gems, intoxicants, poisons, drugs, the profession of medicine or should pass a sale deed, deed of gift or give a decision about a debt; no one should falsely accuse another of the great sins, nor take treasure trove, nor frame new rules for clubs or con vivial gatherings ( samāja) nor should publish slander against a caste, nor should appropriate property which is without an owner or has been lost, nor divulge the ( king's ) lines of policy, nor babble about the vices of the king; the people should not

even think of forsaking their dharma, speaking untruth, commit ting adultery with another's wife, giving false evidence or fabricating documents, accepting gifts secretly, committing thefts and engaging in other desperate acts, engaging in sedi tion; public servants should not exact more than the tax already settled ; only such weights and measures are to be used as bear the royal stamp; all subjects should strive to possess good qualities; desperadoes should be arrested and handed over to the king; bulls let loose (in memory of the dead ) should be kept well controlled and fed by those who let them loose. Medhātithi on Manu VIII. 399 states that a king may prohibit the export of foodstuffs from the kingdom in a famine. The several edicts of Asoka show that his orders were framed on the same lines that are contained centuries later on in the Sukra nitisāra. Most of his proclamations insist on moral virtues such as truthfulness, obedience and reverence to parents, elders and preceptors, honouring brāhmaṇas and śramaņas, kindness to animals, tolerance of other faiths. Proclamations that may be called positive laws are very few, such as his order in Pillar Edict IV to give three days' respite to criminals condemned to death (C. I. I. vol. I p. 125 ) or his regulations restricting the killing of animals contained in the 5th Pillar Edict (C. I. I. vol. I. p. 138 ) or in the First Rock Edict at Girnar (p. ) 'no living being must be killed or sacrificed and no festival meeting must be held'. In the reign of Avanti varman of Kashmir the killing of living beings was prohibited for ten years ( vide Rājatarangini V. 64). Law-making in the modern sense is almost entirely lacking in the smrtis. Gaut. XI. 19-25. show 128 that the king was to find the law required for the decision of causes from the following, viz. (1) the Veda, Dharmaśāstras, the Angas (lores auxiliary to the Veda such as grammar, exegesis, metrice etc.), Upavedas, Purāpas; (2) customs of countries, castes and families that were not opposed to the Veda; (3) the usages of husbandmen, traders, herdemen, money lenders and artizans; (4) ratiocination;(5) the opinions 188a delivered

by the assembly (parisad) of men deeply learned in the three Vedas. The authoritativeness of custome, usages and conven tions and their relation to śāstra will be discussed later on. In the decision of causes there were four deciding factors, dharma, vyavahāra, caritra and rājaśāsana, which will also be dealt with later. So royal edicts or orders first came to be made in the administration of justice and probably served as laws or precedents in later times. Vide H. of Dh. vol. II. pp. 968–970 for the role of parişads in religious matters. Yāj. I. 9 and Sankha speak of parşat or assembly of learned men as final authorities on dharma. 

The executive functions of the king required a large number of ministers and officers. This topic will be dealt with immedia tely below. 

There is another way of looking at the king's functions viz. they were religious and secular. The first required him to do certain acts for propitiating gods and unseen powers and removing dangers therefrom with the help of the purohita and sacrificial priests ( vide Gaut. XI. 15-17, Yāj. I. 308 ) and he had to guard dharma. His secular functions included those that led to prosperity, that helped the people in famine and similar calamities, dealing even-handed justice, guarding person and property from thieves and trespassers and against invasion, 

The Mahābhārata records the tradition that many kings of former times abdicated the throne in favour of their song and resorted to the forest as hermits. Vanaparva 202.8 mentions Bṛhadaśya who crowned his son Kuvalāśva. Vide also Vāyu 88.32. Dhrtarāstra says to Yudhisthira that in their family it was customary for kings to transfer the sovereignty to their song and resort to a forest towards the close of their lives ( Aśramavābi 3.38). Vyāsa says that that was the practice of all rājargis (Aśramavāsi 4.5) and the Aśramavāsiparva (20) mentions the names of several such kings. Vide also Santi 21.15. In Ayodhyā 23.27, 94.19 this practice is referred to. 189 In the Raghuvamsa (I. 8, XVIII. 7, 9, 26) Kalidasa says that in the family of Raghu kings in their old age became munis (hermits) and in chap. VIII. 11-23 he draws a fine contrast between the lives of Aja and his father Raghu ( who had become a yati). There are Jain traditions of some antiquity that connect the

Vide Indian Antiquary, vol. 21 pp. 156 ff where Fleet criticizes this tradition and rejects it.

A.S. for 1913 pp. 656-658) says that there is in this probably a reminiscence of abdication by Aśoka. King Lavanaprasāda of the Vaghela dynasty in Gujerat abdicated in favour of his son Viradhayala (1233-38 A. D.). Vide Bombay Gazetteer, vol. I part 1 pp. 198, 200, 206. 

___Kautilya (VIII. 2) speaks of a novel rule called 'dvai rājya' 131 (sovereignty of two) and distinguishes it from 'vairajya'. The Mss. differ in their readings, but the reading given in the footnote by Dr. Sham Sastri seems preferable, Kaut. remarks "As between dvairajya and vairajya (foreign rule) the former perishes on account of mutual hatred and rivalry; but the latter according to the ūcāryas is enjoyed by foreigners as it is, when it pays attention to winning over the subjects; 'No' says Kautilya 'dvairājya' (generally) exists between father and son or between two brothers, their welfare is the same and therefore by reason of the influence of amātyas (over the two rulers) it can last, but uairājya comes into existence by being seized from another king who is living and therefore the (foreign ruler) thinking this country is not mine' impoverishes it and carries off its wealth or treats it as a chattel (for sale ) or when he finds that the country is disaffected towards him abandons it and goes away". This remarkable passage contains the mentality of foreign rulers in a nutshell Manu IV, 160 in a lucid and laconic manner states how in dividual and national happiness lies in freedom. Kālidāsa in his Malavikāgnimitras (Act V) appears to refer to the conception

of dvairājya when he makes Agnimitra say that the latter desires to establish a dvairājya for the brothers Yajñasena and Madhavasena on the north and south banks of the river Varadā, who would both remain under the command of the king (Agni mitra). In the Mahābhārata a similar rule of two brothers, Vinda and Anuvinda in Avanti, appears to be referred to (vide Udyogaparva 166, cr. ed. chap. 163). MacCrindle in 'Invasion of India by Alexander' p. 296 quotes Diodorus to the effect that Alexander sailing up the river came to Taula (Patala?) a city of great note with a political constitution drawn on the same lines as the Spartan, for in this community the command in war was vested in two hereditary kings of two different houses, while a council of elders ruled the whole State with paramount authority. Vide Jayaswal's 'Hindu Polity' part I pp. 96-97 and Dr. D. R. Bhandarkar's 'Ancient Indian Polity'p. 99-100 for some further details on dvairājya from Buddhist and other sources. 

CHAPTER IV 

MINISTERS 

Amatya -The second of the seven elements of rājya is the amālya, which word may be translated as 'minister.' There are three words that are interchangeable though sometimes dis tinguished, viz. amõtya, saciva and mantrin, the first being the oldest of the three. A Kārikā on Pāṇini (IV. 2. 104) teaches the formation of the word with the affix tyap (tya ) from ama meaning near or with'( vide Mahābhāsya, vol. II. p. 292). In Rg. IV. 4. 1 188 there is the germ of this word 'O Agnil Go like a king riding an elephant, accompanied by his ministers '. Yāska (in Nirukta VI. 12 ) explains' amayān ' as 'amātya vān,' though two more explanations of the word are offered by him. The word amatya itself occurs in Rg. VII. 15. 3, but there it is an adjective and means 'our own' or ' abiding in our house '. In some of the sūtras like the Baudhāyanapitf-medhasūtra (I. A. 13, I. 12. 7 ) the word amātya is used in the sense of 'near male relations in the house'. Vide H. Dh, vol. II. p. 588 n. 1375. The word ' amātya' occurs in the sense of minister in Ap. Dh. 8. II. 10. 25. 10 The king should not live better or more luxuriously than his gurus ( elders) and his ministers (gurūn amātyānsca nātijivet)'. The word 'gaciva' occurs in the Ait. Br. ( XII. 9) where it is said that Indra considered the Maruts as his 'sacivas' (helpers or comrades). The necessity of amatyas or sacivas is stated in graphic language by several writers. Kautilya (I. 7 last verse ) says 'kingship is possible only with ( the aid of) assistants, a single wheel cannot work ( a chariot ); therefore the king should appoint ministers and listen to their opinions'. Manu ( VII. 55 = Sukra II. 1) says it is difficult for a person single-handed to accomplish even an easy task ; how can government particularly, which has great good as its aim, be accomplished without helpers'? The Matsya-purāņa ( 215. 2 ) prescribes the king, while his head is still wet with the waters of coronation, if he wants to supervise his State, should choose his helpers, as in the latter the kingdom secures stability. Matsya 215. 3 is the same as Manu VII. 55. Vide

Visņudharmottara II. 24. 2-3 which are the same as Matsya 215. 2-3; also śānti 106. 11 and Rājanttiprakāśa p. 174. From Arthašāstra I." and 8, Manu VII, 54 and 60, Kām. IV. 25, 27, XIII, 24 and 64 it appears that they use the words saciva and amātya as synonyms. Rudradāman in his Junāgadh Inscription 134 (E. I. vol. VIII. p. 36 at p. 44 ) states that his great enterprise to repair the Sudarsana lake was disapproved of by his advisory (mati-saciva) and executive councillors (karma saciva) who were all endowed with the qualities required in amātyas and yet who were averse to the project and had no enthusiasm for it, since the breach to be repaired was very great. Here sacivas are divided into two sorts, those who give advice and those who execute the business decided upon and the word baciva seems to be a synonym of amātya. Amara 185 states that the amātya who is a dhisaciva (i. e. matisaciva ) is called a mantrin, while amātyas other than the mantrin are called karmasacivas. These distinctions are often not observed. Sumantra is called amātya in Rāmāyaṇa I. 7.3 and the best of mantrins in I. 8. 4. In Ayodhya 112. 17 amatya and mantrin seem to be distinguished. From Kaut. I. 8 ( last verse ) ' Having divided the spheres of their powers and having taken into consideration the time and place and the work they have to do, all these persons should be appointed as ministers ( amātyas ), but not as mantrins,' it follows that mantrins were regarded by Kautilya as of a higher grade than amātyas in general. The R. N. P. p. 178 says that the amātyas are also styled mantrins. Kautilya states (I. 10 ) how amātyas are to be tested by upadhās i. e. by means of tempting them as regards each of dlurnu, artha, kama, and bhaya (fear) and to be employed if found honest after any one of the four tests, while mantrins were to be appoint ed only if their integrity and loyalty were proved by all the tests combined. Upadhā 138 is defined by the Nitivākyāmrta p. 111 as 'testing the mind of a person as regards dharma, artha, kama and bhaya by various devices' ( employed by secret agents). Kāt. (4-5 ) quoted by R. N. P. p. 136 states that the minds of kings always go astray on the (slightest ) cause by

reason of the fact that they possess great valour, knowledge, wealth and particularly the fact that they possess absolute power; therefore brāhmaṇas should always enlighten the mind of the king as to the duties of a king. 

About the number of members in the council of ministers there has been a great divergence of views from ancient times, Kaut. I. 15 and Kām. XI. 67-68 state that according to the Mānava school the council (parişad) of ministers should be constituted of twelve amātyas, acc. to the Bārhaspatyas of 16, acc. to the Auśanasas of 20, but Kautilya's own opinion was that the number is determined by the power or exigencies of the State (yathāsāmarthyam). The Bālakāpda (7. 2-3) states that Dasaratha had eight honest and devoted amatyas ( who are then named). Manu VII. 54 and Mānasollāsa (II. 2. verse 57 ) require that the king should select seven or eight ministers who should be hereditary, versed in the sāstras, brave, born of high family and well-tested. This advice was followed by Shivaji, the founder of the Maratha empire, who had a council of eight ministers (Pradhānas). Vide Ranade's 'Rise of the Maratha Power' pp. 125-126 where he describes the functions of the eight ministers called 'Mukhya-pradhana' (Prime minister)', Pant Amatya ( Finance minister), Pant Sachiva (General Accountant and Auditor), Senāpati (Commander-in chief), Mantsi (in charge of king's private affairs ), Sumanta (Foreign Secretary ), Panditrao ( in charge of the Ecclesiastical Department), Nyāyādhisha (Chief Justice ). This list was probably taken by Shivaji's advisers from the Sukranitisāra II. 71-72 where almost the same eight are said to be the ministers according to some, Vide also Grant Duff's History of the Marathas, vol. I. p. 193, and Rao Bahadur Wad's selec tions of sanads and letters ( in Marathi) published by Messrs. Mawajee and Parasnis in 1913, where the names of the eight ministers of Shivaji are stated and their duties are described (p. 123). In the Santiparva (85. 7-9) it is declared that the king should have 37 sacivas, of whom 4 should be learned and bold brāhmaṇas, 8 valiant kşatriyas, 21 prosperous vaiśyas, 3 sūdras and one sūta versed in the Purāņas, but Verse 11 adds that the king should discuss and settle lines of policy in the midst of eight mantrins and Santi 83. 47 says that mantrins should not be less than three. In the Rāmāyana (II 100.71 ) Rāma whom Bharata came to meet in the former's exile asks him whether he held consultation with three or four mantrins and ( in verse 18 = Sabhāparva 5. 30) Rāma hopes

that Bharata did not settle his policies by himself alone or in consultation with too many ministers. Kautilya also (I. 15) lays down that the king should hold consultation with three or four mantring. The Nitivākyāmrta (mantrisamuddeśa pp. 127-128) holds that they should be three, five or soyen, that unanimity is difficult to secure in a group of persons of different characters and that when there are many ministers they are jealous and try to carry out their own ideas. These passages show that firstly there was to be a small cabinet of three or four ministers, secondly there was to be a council ( parişad ) of ministers who might be eight or more in number according to requirements and thirdly there was a large number of amātyās or sacivas (high functionaries concerned with various departments ). The council is mentioned in the 3rd and 6th Rock Edicts of Asoka (Corpus I. I. vol. I. p. 4 ' parisā pi yute ājñāpayisati') in the words *the council will order the officers called Yuktas'. The qualifica tions of ministers (amātyas) are laid down in several places e. g. in Kautilya I. 9, Manu VII. 54, Yāj. I. 312. Kām. IV. 25-30 (of which verses 28-30 are almost the same as the words of Kautilya ), Santi 118. 2-3 (14 qualities of mantrins are men tioned ), Sānti 80. 25-28, Bālakāņda 7. 7-14, Ayodhyākānda 100. 15, Medhātithi on Manu VII. 54, Agnipurāņa 239.11-15 (= Kam. IV. 25 and 28-31 ), Mānasollāsa II. %, verses 52-59, Nitivāky āmộta p. 108, Rājanitiratnākara pp. 13-14 ( quoting Nārada and Harita ), Rājanitiprakāśa pp. 174-178, Rājadharmakaustubha pp. 251-254, Budhabhūşaņa pp. 32, 57–58. Only the qualities required by Kautilya in amatya are set out here: He must be a native of the country, born of high family, influential, well trained in arts, far-sighted, wise, of good memory, vigilant, eloquent, bold, intelligent, endowed with enthusiasm and dignity, capable of endurance, pure (in mind and actions), well-disposed, firmly devoted ( to the king ), endowed with character, strength, health, spiritedness, free from arrogance and fickleness, affec tionate, who would not have recourse to hatred (even when offended by the king). Kautilya states that amātyas are of three kinds, the best, middling and inferior, of which the first must be endowed in full with the qualities set out by him and the other two are deficient by one quarter and a half respectively. In Santi 83. 35-40 the faults that disqualify a person for being a mantrin are stated and verses 41-46 set out the qualifications for'a mantrin, one of which deserves special notice, viz, ( verse 46 ) he should have secured the confidence of the pauras and jānapadas. Many works prescribe that the ministers were

to be hereditary if the son was capable like his father, e. g. Manu VII. 54, Yāj. I. 312, Rāmāyana II. 100. 26 ( = Sabhāparva 5.43 ), Agni, 220. 16-17, Sukra II. 114, The Matsya 215. 83-84 and Agnipurāna ( 220. 16-17) add the very sensible remark that such hereditary ministers should not be allowed to dispose of the cases of their dāyādas (agnates ). The Vişnudharmottara (II. 24, 55-56 ) contains the same rule. This hereditary character is borne out by many inscriptions. For example, in the Allahabad stone pillar ing. of Samudragupta, Harişena is himself a Mahā. daņda-nāyaka whose father Dhruvabhūti was also a Mahādanda nāyaka (Gupta Inscriptions pp. 10, 15 ) and in the Udayagiri cave Inscription of Candragupta II (ibid p. 34) Virasena is described as ' anvayaprāptasācivya' (who hereditarily obtained the post of saciva). The R. N.P. (p. 176) after quoting the Matsya purāņa expressly states that the hereditary principle was to be given up, if the son or grandson of a former minister had not the requisite qualifications, but that such a descendant was to be employed only in such state work as was suited to his " attainments. The mantrins should, according to most authorities, be chosen from among brāhmanas, ksatriyas and vaisyas, but not from śüdras, even if the latter be endowed with qualities (vide Sukra II. 426-427, Nitivākyāmsta p. 108). 18a The consultation with the council of ministers was to be in secret. Kautilya (I. 15 ) says 'All administrative undertaking! must be preceded by consultation with ministers. The place for consultation should be so secluded that the conversation going on inside will not be heard outside and that even birds cannot see it, for it is narrated that secret consultations were divulged by parrots, mainas, dogs and other lower animals '. 138 The Harsacarita VI states that Nāgasena of the Nāga dynasty met destruction in Padmāvati because his secret policy was divulged

Consultations with ministers

by a mainā, Srutavarman lost his kingdom in Srāvasti as his gecret was disclosed by a parrot, and king Suvarnacūda met his death in Mșttikāyati by babbling in a dream about his policy. Vide also Manu VII. 147-150, Yāj. I. 344, Kām. XI. 53, 65-66, Agnipurāna 225. 19, Mānasollāsa II. 9, verses 700-705 p. 92. Kaut (1. 15) has a verse' no outsider should know the king's secret policy which he desires to carry out. Only those who are to carry it out should know it only when it is begun or accomplished'. Vide for a similar rule Manu VII. 105 (=śānti. 140, 24 which is also the last but one verse in Kaut. I. 15). 139 The king presided in the council, but if he was not present the chief minister presided (Manu VII. 141 ). In the Mālavikāgnimitra (V) the king's decision to make a dvairājya is conveyed to the council of ministers and then the amātya (who here means the chief minister or President of the council ) informs the king that the council agreed with the king, where upon the king asks the council to depute the commander-in chief Virasena to carry out the proposal. Kaut. further says (I. 15 ) that all business was to be transacted in the presence of the ministers ; but if any one was absent his opinion was to be elicited by despatching a letter. In matters of emergency (or great danger ) the king is to call his cabinet ministers and the council of ministers and what the majority decide or what would lead to success is to be carried out by the king. Sukra I. 365 also refers to the view of the majority. It is the duty of the ministers, according to Kām. IV. 41-49, to prevent a king from 

pursuing an evil course, it is the duty of the king to listen to the advice of his ministers and such ministers are not merely his friends but are really his gurus. "40 Sukra (II. 82-83) asks · How can the kingdom be brought to prosperity by those ministers whom the king is not afraid to offend? They are no better than ladies who are to be decked with ornaments and fine clothes. What is the use of those ministers, whose advice does not tend to the advancement of the kingdom, the people, the army, the treasury, good government and to the destruction

of enemies? The ministers, however, must have found it difficult to please the king and also to placate the subjects. A well-known subhāşita states that one who looks to the benefit of the king comes to be hated by the people and he who looks to the good of the people (only) is abandoned by the king; when there is this great conflict it is rare to find a person who can secure the aims of both the king and the people."40x Manu (VII. 56-59) prescribes the matters in which consultations are to be held with ministers and the procedure thereof, viz. peace and war, sthāna (i. e. army, treasury, capital and the country), sources of revenue, protection (of himself and of the country), the proper bestowal of the wealth obtained; the king is to ascertain the opinions of ministers separately and then jointly and then do what is beneficial; he is then to hold consultation on the most important affairs relating to the six means of policy with a wise brāhmaņa who is the most distinguished of all ministers and always to rely upon him, to settle all lines of policy finally on his advice and then to act. Yaj. I. 312 also requires the king to consult his mantrins, then a brāhmaṇa (purohita ) and thereafter to decide himself the course of action, The principal matters which mantrins have to concentrate them selves upon, acc. to Kām. XIII. 23-24 (=Agnipurāņa 241. 16–18), are : mantra, securing the fruit of the line of policy adopted ( such as conquering a country and protecting it), the carrying out of the business ( of the State ), predicting the good or evil effects (of an action taken), revenue and expenditure, govern ment (i. e. punishing those who deserve punishment), subduing enemies, measures against calamities like famine, guarding the king and the kingdom. \\ The Nītivākyāmộta (p. 185) concisely puts the same by saying that amātyas have to concern them selves with revenue, expenditure, guarding the ruler (i. e. his body, his dharma, wife and children ), looking after the army in all its arms. 

Yāj. I. 343 says since the State depends upon mantra (i. e. lines of policy arrived at after consultation with ministers), the

king should keep his lines of policy secret in such a way that people should not know them till the results of his undertakings manifest themselves'. Kautilya (X. 6 last verse ) emphasizes the importance of mantra in 'an arrow discharged by an archer may kill one man or none at all, but a ( well-considered) scheme put into operation by a wise man may destroy even those who are only conceived'. 142 Both Sabhāparva 5. 27 and Ayodhyā 100. 16 have the same verse, viz. mantra is the root of victory.16 Kautilya and the Nitivākyāmsta p. 114 say that mantra accomplishes the following, viz. the apprehension of what is not or cannot be seen, imparting the strength of definite conclusion to what is apprehended, removal of doubt when two courses or opinions are possible, inference of an entire matter when only a part is seen." In most works such as Kauţ. I. 15, Kām. XI. 56, Agnipurāna 241, 4, Pancatantra I. p. 85, Mānasollāsa (II. 9 verse 697 ff, p. 92 ) it is said that mantra has five elements which have to be considered (it is pancanga), viz, means of carrying out actions (or works), plenty of men and materials, proper allotment of time and place, remedies against pitfalls, the ( happiness of the kingdom or people ) that will result from the accomplishment of the course decided upon. 145 

The high functionaries and office-holders have been different at different times. In the Vedic age, in the performance of the Rājasūya, there are certain offerings (generally twelve in number) which are called 'ratninām havimşi'. Their order and names differ in different texts, though most are the same in all. Besides the king (the sacrificer), the eleven 'ratnas' ( jewels ) or 'ratnins' are (according to the Sat. Br. V. 3. 2). the commander-in-chief, the purohita, the crowned queen, sūta grāmaņi, kşatış (chamberlain), sangrahit? (treasurer or charioteer?),

V. 3. 2. 2 and 4 that some of these jewels like the commander-in-chief and the huntsman were of low caste or of the sūdra caste. Later on certain functionaries began to be called tirthas, their number being 18; vide Sabhāparva 5. 38 ( –Ayodhya 100, 36 ) and Sānti 69.52 for a reference to the 18 tirthas. 148 Kautilya (I. 12 ) speaks of the 18 tirthas and enumerates them. 17 In the Raghuvamsa 17.68 Kālidāsa employs the word tirtha in this sense. According to the Nitivākyāmsta (p. 29 ) persons who are helpers in dharma and state business are called tirtha. In the Edicts of Asoka the high officers were called mahāmātras ( in Rock Edict XII there are dharma-mahāmātras ) and other officers were yuktas, rājukas and prādesikas (in Rock Edict III) of whom the first at least were subordinate to the council of ministers.

on the Yasastilaka I. p. 91 differ as to the names of these 18. 148 The Rājatarangiņi I. 120 informs us that in former times there were only seven departments ( karmasthānas ), that later on they became 18 and that five more were added to these eighteen (IV. 142-143 and 512) viz. mahāpratihāra, mahāsāndhivigraha, mahāśvaśāla, mahābhāndāgāra, mahāsādhanabhāga (and so the Heads were called 'adhigata-pañcamahāśabda' i. e. to whom five titles with 'mahā' in them were given). "9 The Agni purāņa 220 mentions several high functionaries like the senāpati, pratihāra, dūta and heads of departments. The Sukra nitisāra ( II. 69-70 ) enumerates ten principal high functionaries of the king (prakřtis ) viz. purodhas (purohita), pratinidhi, pradhāna ( President of council ), saciva (war minister), mantrin ( Home minister), prādvivāka (minister of justice ), pandita (minister of ecclesiastical matters), sumantra (Finance minister), amātya (revenue minister) and düta (minister of diplomatic relations ) and remarks that others omitted purodhas and data from this list of ten and held that these eight should all receive the same pay ( verses 71-72), while śukra was of opinion that the ten high dignitaries should each receive in order one tenth more as pay than the succeeding one ( v. 71 ), that the purohita was the most eminent of all, that among the rest each preceding was more eminent than each succeeding one ( 11. 74-77), that after these high dignitaries came the other officers (adhikārigana, II. 279), that then came the darśaka ( secretary?), and lekhaka ( clerk), then the menial servants who waited on the king and lastly the lowest were those who carried out dirty work, In II. 84-87 Sukra briefly brings out the special functions of the

In the Talcher grant of Kulastambha in the 9th century the epithet 'samadhigata-pancamabāšabda' is applied to a king (mabārājādhirāja) in E. I. vol. XII P: 157, while in an Inscription from Yewur of about 1040 A. D. it is applied to a mabāmandalesvara (E. I. vol. XII. p. 269). In the Pimpari plates of Dhārāvarsa Dhruvarāja dated Sake 697 the same title is applied to a minister described as Agafarer FUATA (E. I, vol. X. p. 89). Vide J BBRAS (New series) vol.

ministers from pratinidhi to dūta 150 and then in II. 88-105 at length. In 1. 353-361 Sukra lays down how the king's public durbar should be arranged, viz. the king's throne should be in the centre of the western half of the hall on which the king should sit well-dressed, wearing his crown, armour and a drawn sword; his sons, grandsons, brother's and sister's sons should sit behind him, his daughter's sons should sit on his right and on his left should sit in order his uncles, chief agnates, members of the assembly, commanders ; in front of the king to his right should be seated his maternal grandfather's relatives, the man trins, and to the left his father-in-law, wife's brother, officers &c. The Sukranitisāra ( I. 374-376 ) lays down certain very practical rules for the king :'he should personally observe villages, towns and districts every year; he should see whether his subjects are kept contented or are harassed by his officers, he should not side with the officers (with the man on the spot ) but rather should take the side of the subjects, he should remove an officer who is hateful to many (lit, a hundred ) people and an amūtya should be removed if he is found to commit several illegal acts. Sukra ( in II. 107-113 ) further advises the change of portfolios among the ministers (e. 8. sumantra should be appointed amatya or vice versa); he says that for each department three should be engaged, one the most clever being the head and two others being darsakas (secretaries ) who should be changed every thrée, five, seven or ten years; one man should not be allowed to hold the same high office for a long time, since otherwise he becomes intoxicated with power; 181 servants should not do any business without a written order nor should a king order any thing to be done except in writing (II. 290 ).

officers every five years. The 6th caste mentioned by Megas thenes (Fragment 1 p. 41 and Fragment XXXIII p. 85 in McCrindle's 'Ancient India') was that of overseers who inquired into and superintended all that went on in India, and made reports to the king or, where there was no king, to the magistrate Megasthenes probably confounded the ministers and adhyaksas ( who were often hereditary ) with a caste. Vide also Fragment XXXIV pp. 86-88 about the officers of state and their duties. It is probably on account of some such rule as is stated in Sukra about frequent change of portfolios that in the inscriptions high functionaries have epithets prefixed to them which indicate their connection with several portfolios e. g. in the Bangkhera plate of Emperor Harsa ( E. I. vol. IV p. 208 at p. 211) Skanda gupta ( who is probably the same as the Skandagupta mentioned by Bāņa in the Harsacarita VI as commander of the elephant arm) was the dūlaka of the grant and is described as' mahāpramātāra mahāsāmanta'; in the Allahabad stone pillar Ing. of Emperor Samudragupta (Gupta Inscriptions p. 10 and p. 15 n. 4), Harişeņa is described as 'Sāndhivigrahika'( minister for peace and war ), Kumārāmātya'(the minister of the Yuvarāja ?) and Mahā-danda nāyaka 158 ( commander of an army); Pșthyisena ( a brāhmana) is described as mantrin, kumārāmātya and then mahābalā dhiksta (in E. I. vol. X p. 72, of Gupta Samvat 117). In theory and practice the king was to issue orders in the presence or under the advice of his principal ministers. We read in the grant of Rājarāja I of the Eastern Cālukya dynasty that he issued his command in the presence of the mantrin, purohita, senā pati, yuvarāja, dauvārika and pradhāna (E. I vol. IV. p. 300 at p. 302 ). Sukra (II. 362-370 ) describes the procedure followed in issuing orders about State business. First the mantrin, prādvivāka (Chief Judge), pandita (head of ecclesiastical department ), and dūta should write out the business relating to their departments, then the amātya should write thereon ( sādhu likhanam-asti, the writing is good), sumantra adds samyag vicaritam' (it is well considered ), the pradhāna writes 'satyam yathārtham" (it is the truth, it is as the business requires ), pratinidhi should write 'angikartuin yogyam' (it is proper to accept this ), the yuvarāja should write 'angikartavyam' ( it should be accepted ), the purohita should write "lekhyam svā. 

152. 'Mahādandanāyaka' may mean the chief minister ' as Manu VII. 65 states 'on the amātya depends the control (of the govero meot) and discipline (among subjects) depends on control (danda).'

bhimatam' (this writing is approved by me); all then should make their seals after their remarks and then the king should write angikstam'188 ( it is accepted) and affix his soal. 

The Rājatarangipi shows that persons often rose to ministe rial positions from low birth e. g. (V. 73) it states that an engineer of Avantivarman was a foundling, ( VII. 207) a watch man became chief minister. 

It is necessary to say a few words about some of the great officers of State. First comes the Yuvarāja. Kautilya devotes one chapter (I. 17 ) to taking care of the prince. The subjects of the prince's education, his association with state business, treatment of princes, good or bad, the coronation of a yuvarāja have already been dealt with (pp. 49, 83 &c.). The younger brother or eldest son was made yuvarāja ( Crown Prince ) during the reigning king's life ( Ayodhyā, chap. 3-6, Kām. VII. 6, Sukra II. 14-16). Rāma on his coronation as king made Bharata the Crown Prince when Lakşmaņa refused to be so (Yuddha 131.93). The yuvarāja and princes were often sent as governors of different parts of the realm. The Divyāvadāna ( XXVI. p. 371 ) states that Asoka was sent by his father Bindusāra to Takşašila to pacify popular disturbances and Emperor Asoka himself is said to have sent his son Kunāla from Pataliputra to the same town to pacify the citizens that had been offended by the arrogance of the amātyas (ibid. pp. 407-8). Khāravela in the Hāthigumphā Ins. ( E. I. vol. XX at pp. 79, 86) was a yuvarāja for nine years from his 16th to his 24th year. From the Mālavikāgnimitra we learn that while Pusyamitra was virtual emperor of Bharatavarşa his son Agnimitra was ruling at Vidika and had the authority to divide the kingdom of Berar betweon two brothers, Yajñasena and Mādhavasena. The yuvarāja is not generally enumerated in the lists of mantrins, but he is one of the 18 tirthas and from Sukra ( above p. 115) it appears that he had a seal and important matters passed through his hands along with those of the ministers. According 14 to 

153. Compare the word "drstam' occurring at the beginning of Chammak and Sivani grants of the Vākāțaka emperor Pravarasena II and the same word in the plate of the Pallava kiog Sivaskandavarman (in E. I. vol. I. at p. 9). In most plates of the Vākāļakas the word 'drstan'occurs at the beginning; vide E. I. vol. 22 p. 167.

The Yuvarāja and the State 

117 

Sukra ( II. 12 ) the yuvarāja and the group of amātyas are the two arms or eyes of the king, but Sukra V. 17 warns the king against transferring all power to the Crown Prince except when the king is about to die. The Matsyapurāņa 220.7 quoted in the Budhabhūşaņa (p. 33) prescribes that the king should entrust to the well-disciplined prince at first unimportant offices and then gradually important ones. 185 If a prince was ill-behaved he was not to be abandoned as he would go over to the enemies and harm the king, but he should be kept confined in a guarded place ( Kām. VII. 6, Budhabhūsana pp. 33, 35, verses 77, 93). As regards his emoluments he was placed on the same footing as the mantrin, purohita, senāpati, the queen, the king's mother (Kaut. V. 3). What office is meant by the Kumārāmatya in some of the Inscriptions ( e. g. Gupta Ing. pp. 10, 50, E. I. vol. X p. 72, E. I. vol. XI. p. 83 ) is not clear. It does not probably mean 'a royal prince who was also an amātya', but rather some minister attached to the yuvarāja, as contradistinguished from rājāmātya (which office occurs in Gupta Inscriptions, p. 218). It appears that in ancient times provincial governors could be total strangers to the royal family. From Rudradāman's Junagadh Ing. we learn that the governor of Surāştra under Candragupta Maurya was a vaisya called Puşyagupta and under Aśoka a Yavana noble or king called Tuşāspa "Sa (E. I. VIII p. 36 at p. 43). 

Next comes the purohitu. In H. Dh. vol. II pp. 40 and 363 it has been already shown how purohitas existed from the most ancient period of the Rgveda, how the purohita was thought to be half the soul of the king and how the co-operation of the spiritual teacher and the secular head ( the king ) was deemed absolutely necessary for the prosperity of the kingdom, how Gautama (XI. 12-14) and Āp. Dh, S. II. 5. 10. 16 prescribed the qualities of the purohita. Our authorities show that the purohita was not a mere priest. The Ait. Br. ( 40.2 ) calls the purohita *rāştragopa '( the saviour of the kingdom ). The Sukraniti also, 

155. S tig Farratei TFTOT I et for ma: T FRONTY HETFOTO \# ARET 220. 7, qu. p. 33 

155a. It is strange that Dr. Beni Prasad in 'The State in ancient India' (p. 189) remarks "the former governor is designated rastriya while the latter is called adhisthūya". "Adhisthaya' in Rudradāman's Ins. is only a gerund of sthā' with "adbi' and means 'having ruled over '. राष्ट्रिय is formed from रा according to राहावारपाराह यसो (Pan. IV. 2.93) and means 'one ruling over a proviące, a Provincial Governor'. Ia dramas a means ' king's brother-in-law'. Kpirasvāni says' Arograma El

118 

History of Dharmasastra 

(Vol. 

though a very late work, similarly describes the purohita (II. 74 ) as "rājarāstrabhrt' (the supporter of the king and the kingdom). In the Rgveda III. 53. 12 we find the idea that the hymns and the spiritual power of the purohita Visvāmitra protected the Bharata clan. 156 He made the king ready for battle and accompanied him in battle murmuring where the arrows fly &c'. (Rg. VI. 75.17) while the fight went on (vide Aøv. Gr. III. 12. 19 quoted below n. 308). The Vişnudharmasūtra HI. 70, Yāj. I. 313, Kām. IV. 32 require that the purohita was to be well versed '57 in the vedas, itihāsa, dharmaśāstra or danda niti, in astrology and portents, in rites of propitiation contained in the Atharvaveda, of high family, endowed with all vidyās and good acts as stated in the śāstras and with austerities. Kaut. (I. 9) states almost the same qualifications for the purohita, requires the king to honour his advice as a pupil honours his teacher or a son his father or a servant his master and says that royal power advanced by brāhmaṇas, enforced as with a spell by the consultations of mantrins and endowed as with a weapon by the observance of śāstric rules becomes invincible and secures success. Vide Adi. 170.74-75, 174. 14-15, śānti. 72. 2-18 and chap. 73, Rājanltiprakāśa pp. 59-61 and 136-137, Rāja" dharma-kaustubha pp. 255-257 for qualifications expected in the purohita. Kautilya (X. 3) states that while a battle is going on the chief ) minister and purohita should urge on and encourage the soldiers by exhorting them with verses from the Veda and classical Sanskrit, promising great rewards in the next world for those who fall in battle. The Sukranitisāra ( II. 78-80 ) requires in the purohita among other qualities the study of dhanurveda, proficiency in arms and in formations of armies for battle and possession of so much religious merit as to be able to pronounce an effective curse. A purohita was to be distinguished from a stuj (a sacrificial priest) as Manu VII. 78 and Yaj. I. 314 show. Vide Mānasollāsa II. %. 60 (p. 34), Rājanitiratnākara pp. 16-17, Vispudharmottara II. 5., Agni 239. 16-17 for further passages on purohita. Some authorities include

the purohita among amatyas or mantrins (e. g. Vijñāneśvara on Yāj. I. 353, Sukra II. 69-70), while others like Yāj. I. 312 regard him as distinct from mantring. The purohita was often hereditary. Acc. to Kautilya quoted above he was to employ means declared in the Atharvaveda to remove calamities, divine and human. The great divine calamities acc. to Kautilya IV. 3 are fire, flood, disease, famine, rats, wild elephants, snakes and evil spirits, 158 According to Manu VII. 78 the purohita was concerned with the religious rites laid down in the srauta and grhya sūtras and Ap. II. 5. 10. 14-17 show that the purohita had complete jurisdiction in matters of penance for offences. Vas. ( 19. 40-42 ) provides that if the king lets off an offender deserving to be punished the king had to fast for a day and the purohita for three days and to perform the heavy penance of Krcchra if the king punished the innocent. According to most authorities he played a role that was pre-eminently religious. He is not mentioned among the 10 limbs of the sabhā in the administration of justice. Kāt. 24 (quoted in S. V. p. 20) does not require him to be an expert in arthaśāstra, though Kāt. 56 quoted by the Mit, on Yāj. II. % and Sm, C. (II. p. 14) say that the king should enter the Hall of Justice with learned brāhmaṇas, the ministers, the chief justice, the purohita &c. Yāj. I. 31% and the Mit. on Yāj. I. 312-313 on the other hand prescribe that even after consulting all mantrins, the king was finally to consult the purohita in all secular and religious matters. The Nitivākyāmrta (purohitasamuddeśa ) p. 160 states that the divine calamities are: shower of fire (fall of lightning?), excessive rainfall, epidemics, famine, damage or disease of crops, swarms of locusts and other vermin, diseases, goblins and female evil spirits, snakes, wild elephants, rats. The purohita is required to know ritual of five kinds, '59 viz. that dealing with the propitiation of Nakşatras, that of śrauta sacrifices, that of the sainhitās ( of Tantra worship ), that of Atharvasiras and that of

śāntis ( such as grahaśānti &c.). Calamities, according to Kām. XIII. 20-21, are of two sorts, divine ( daiva ) and human : there are five kinds of the first viz. fire, flood, disease, famine and epidemic, all of which can be met by human effort and by propitiatory rites, while human calamities should be withstood by constant effort and by proper lines of policy. The same verses are Agnipurāņa 241. 14-16. 

Acc. to Kautilya (V.3) 48000 panas were the salary of the (royal) sacrificial priest, ācārya (teacher), mantrin, purohita, commander in-chief, crown prince, the king's mother, the queens and he holds that "with that amount of maintenance they would not yield to temptation or revolt (against the king)",180 The amatyas, the chief judge and even the purohita could be punished by the king, acc. to Manu, if any of them went wrong (VIII. 335 and IX. 234) and Kaut (IX. 3) prescribes that when the purohita is guilty even of a great offence, the remedy is to imprison him or banish him. Some great ministers, though not exactly purohitas of the king, were learned brāhmaṇas and led simple lives such as Cānakya and Madhava. There is divergence of views about the salaries set out in the Arthaśāstra (V. 3). Jayaswal ( in Hindu Polity' part II p. 136 ) holds that the salaries were yearly and the paņas in which they were paid were silver ones. Prof. Dikshitar (in * Mauryan Polity' p. 151 ) holds that the salaries were monthly. Confusion is caused by the fact that there were paņas of copper, silver and gold. Vide Rājanitiprakāda p. 294. The Rājatarangini VII. 950 speaks of dinnāras of gold, silver and copper. Rao Bahadur K. V, Rangaswami Aiyangar holds that the salaries (in the Arthasāstra ) were monthly and in golden paņas (in Ancient Indian Polity' pp. 44-45). Therefore this matter must be investigated. Manu (VIII. 13) promises that those names of copper, silver and gold coins which are well-known among the people (of its day) for purposes of trade will be described by him. Acc. to Manu VIII. 134 and 136, Viṣṇu Dh. S. IV. 6-10, and Yaj. I. 363-365 five krşpalas are equal to a māşa, 16 māşas are equal to a suvarna, 4 suvarnas ( or five aco. to some ) are equal to a pala, a karşa is equal to of a pala and a piece of copper one-fourth of a pala in weight is called a papa, which is the same as kārşāpaņa 16' ( equal to 80 raktikūs or

guñjā berries). A pala was equal to 320 raktikās. Kaut. II. 19 says practically the same thing. In Kaut. V. 3 the salaries range from 48000 to 60 paņas from the highest functionaries to the lowest servants. They must all be taken to be for the same period in every case and in the same metal, since Kaug. expressly states no different periods and no difference in metal. Ordinarily the words pana and karşāpaņa ( as stated by Manu VIII. 136 and the Mit. on Yāj. I. 365 and the Sukraniti IV. 1. 116 ) refer to copper pieces ( used as coins ) and bearing a stamp. Another table given by Manu VIII. 135-136, Vişnu Dh. S. VI. 11-12, Yāj. I. 364 is : 2 raktikās 10% or kropalas = one (silver ) māşa, 16 māsas \#one 

162. A raktikā was found by General Cunningham after many experi ments to weigh on an average 1.8 grains (vide his 'Coins of Ancient India' pp. 45-46 and also Rapson's 'Coins' pp. 2-3). So that a silver dbarana or purāna ( of 32 raktikās) should weigh about 57. 6 grains and a copper pana (of 80 raktikās) should weigh 144 grains. It appears that the weights of Indian coins in different parts and at different times varied a good deal. Cunningham (Coins of Ancient India' p. 5) states that gold was cheap in India, being as one to eight rates of silver. But in medieval times i. e. about 1300 A. D. (vide Sukra IV. 2. 92-93 ) gold was 16 times the price of the same weight of silver, which again was 80 times of the price of the same weight of copper. Though, as stated in note 161 above, a copper pana was usually equal to eighty raktikas, a copper pana of 100 raktikās (i, e, of 20 māşas) was known. Nār. (parisista verse 58) speaks of musa as the 20th part of the kārşāpaņa and the Mit. on Yaj. I. 365 and Vy. Nirnaya p. 207 quote a verse (attributed to Usapas by Haradatta and Maskaria on Gaut. XII. 19 ) that a māsa is a twentieth part of paņa (ATT SITHA \#T: COFFY Trattaa:). The Agaipurāna ( 227. 2) appears to have known a pana of 120 kronalas (Fotorat aur HUT TN \# Strana). The verses in Nār. (parisista 58-60) are ascribed to Kāt, by the Sm. C. II. p. 99 and it is stated by both that those terms are in vogue in Pañcanada (Punjab). When the pana of copper was equal to 20 māsas (and 100 gunijās), the copper coin would have been almost of the weight of the modern copper half anna coin, The table given by Nār. ( pari, 58-60) is: 4 kākinis- māsa, 20 māşas=kāršāpana (which is the same as Andikā ), 4 kārsāpanas dhānaka, 12 dhānakas = suvarna (also called dināra). The table giveo by Br. (as quoted in Sm. C. II p. 99 and V. R. p. 667) is the same. Bș, as quoted by Aparārka p. 832 and V. R. p. 111 employs the word 'nāņaka' for coin, which word also occurs in the Mṛcchakațika and in Vāj. II. 240-241. The Amarakośa states that niska and dināra are synonyms and also gives other meanings of nişka. Sabara on Jai, IV, 3.39 gives the striking example no one would spend a kārsā pana for finding out a kākini that he had lost', The Arthasastra II. 12 p. 84 states that the superintendent of the mint should manufacture copper panas, half panas, kākiņis and half kākinis. The Vişnu Dh. S. V. 96 refers to a golden

silver purāna or dharana ; 10 dharaṇas=one (silver) satamāna. This table was used for silver coins. Thus a dharana would be 1/10th of a pala as stated in the Brhatsamhita ( 10. 13 palada

Under the Guptas golden coins are mentioned as dināras; vide "Gupta Inscriptions'p, 29 at p. 31 where there is a gift of 25 dināras in the Gupta year 93 and pp. 38, 41, 261 ( where it is stated that one bhikṣu was to be fed every day throughout the year from the permanent endowment of 12 dināras). From the Baigram plate dated Gupta samvat 128 it appears that one dinara was equal to 16 rūpakas (silver coins) in E. I. vol. XXI. p. 80. A Mathurā las. of the 28th year of Huviska speaks of the deposit of 550 purānas (E. I. vol. XXI. p. 55 at 61). Bhaskarācārya ( who was born in sake 1036 and wrote his Siddhāntasiromani in 1072 sake i. e. 1150 A. D.) gives the following table (in Lilāvati I. 2-4): 20 varāțakas = kākini, 4 kākinis - pana. 16 panas - dramma, 16 drammas = niska; 2 yavas = guñjā, 3 guājās = valla (modern Marathi vāl), 8 vallas - dharana, 2 dharanas = gadyānaka ; 5 guñjās = māsa, 16 māsas = karsa, 4 karşas = pala and a karşa of gold is called Suvarna. It will be seen that Nār, and Lilavati differ as to ITFOTT. Gadyāņakas of gold are referred to in the Pattadakal pillar Ins. of Kirtivar man I (754 A. D.), where it is stated that a field of 30 nivartanas was purchased for thirty gadyanakas of gold (E. I, vol. III, pp. 6–7). From a verge of the Caturvimsatimata quoted by the Mit. on Yaj. III. 258 it appears that gadyānaka was also a silver coin. From an inscription of Vikramaditya V near Gadag dated sake 934 it appears that fines for offences were levied in gadyanakas (E. I. vol. XX p. 64). The following works may be consulted for further information on Indian coins viz. Cunningham's 'Coins of Ancient India' (1894), Rapson's 'Indian coins' (1897) in the Grundriss, C. J. Brown's Coins of India' (in the Heritage of India' series, 1922). The Dharmadvaitanirnaya (pp. 137-139) and the Vaijayanti on Vişnu Dh. S. IV, 9 may be consulted for efforts to reconcile the various statements about Suvarna, Nişka &c, For an informing paper on the most ancient Denarii, vide Proceedings of the British Academy vol.XVIII pp.211-266 where it is established that the earliest denarius period begins about 187 B. C. Therefore Jolly's assumption (in Recht und Sitte p. 23 followed by Winternitz in 'History of Indian Literaturo' val, II. p. 216. 0, 4 that all Indian works in which the word dināra occurs cannot have been composed before and century A. D. is unwarranted. Prof. Keith (JRAS for 1915. p. 504) does not accept Jolly's assumption. The dināra was variously defined. According to Visņugupta quoted in Hemadri's Vratakhanda, a rūpaka is oth of suvarna and a dināra was equal to 28 rūpakas, while ace, to Nār. aad Kāt. But and fare were synonyms. The Dharmadvaitanirnaya says that a kārsāpaña ( of silver it seems ) was equal to eight or ten dhabbukas. One of the verses of the Jūāpesvarī (composed in 1290 A, D.) that speaks of gold as tu* (15 times ia price of the same weight of silver ) may be cited here are proti vi muatot. * 1 (v. 1. \#T) fageti chap 17 verse 322 (Bhide's and Madgavkar's editions),

sabhāgo dharanam). Nārada (pariţişta 57 ) expressly states that a silver kārşāpaņa is in vogue in the south i. e. a silver pana or kārşāpaņa was not universal. 16 A golden suvarna also comprised 80 guñjas, while the standard silver paņa was of 32. Rhys Davids ( in Buddhist India'p. 100 ) states that about the time of Buddha's birth transactions were carried on in terms of the kahāpana, a square copper coin weighing about 144 grains and guaranteed as to weight and fineness by punch marks made by private individuals, that there were half and quarter kaha panas also, that a kahāpana would be now worth about fths of a penny, though its purchasing power was then equal to about one shilling of the present day. Therefore it is proper to under stand that a paņa or kārşāpaņa, when the word is used without any qualification, was meant to be one of copper and that prima facie the salaries in Kautilya were meant to be in copper panas. This conclusion oan be supported by various considera tions. Manu VII. 126 prescribes that the wages for the lowest menial servant ( such as one who sweeps the house or brings water) is one pana a day and of a superior menial servant 6 paņas a day and that the former was to get in addition one pair of garments every six months and every month a drona of corn (which would be equal to 1024 mustis according to the Mit. on Yāj. III. 274). Whatever ages may be assigned to the Arthaśāstra and the present Manusmfti the two works cannot be separated from each other, if at all, by more than a century or two. Therefore the economic conditions of the one may be held to have not differed much from those to which the other refers. It is impossible to hold that the lowest menial servant got one gold paņa a day besides over 30 muştis of corn every day (1024 in a month). If that were so, the lowest menial servants of Kautilya's days would have to be supposed to be a hundred times better off than their confreres in big cities like Bombay towards the end of the 19th century ( when menial servants got from five to ten rupees a month without any allowance of grain ). Therefore the pana in Kautilya V. 3 is not of gold. Kautilya (in V. 3) says that a king who has a depleted treasury may make payment of salary by giving forest produce, cattle or fields along with small guantities of cash, that if he has under taken to colonize a waste tract he may make payment of salary in cash only and not by bestowing a village.

with this he says that 60 panas are to be the equivalent of one adhaka of corn (şaşțivetanasyadhakam krtvā hiraṇyānurūpam bhaktam kuryat). An adhaka 165 came to only 256 muştis (handfuls) of corn and even in famine times one adhaka could not have cost 60 silver paņas, much less golden ones. In V. 3 Kautilya declares that an ordinary dūta should get ten panas for a journey of one yojana and twice the wages for each yojana up to one hundred. A yojana acc. to Kaut himself (II. 20 ) is equal to 8000 dhanus ( acc. to another reading 4000 dhanus ), a dhanus being equal to four aratnis (each aratni being 24 angulas ). So taking the highest figure a yojana was at the 

164. The word hiranya has two senses gold' and ' money or cash' whether in gold, silver or copper (as said by Amara who gives 'draviņa'as a synonym). When Kautilya says that the king may pay. biranya' and not 'grāma' be means only cash payment and not necessarily only gold i vide the copperplate grant of Siladitya VII in Gupta Inscriptions p. 179 at p. 189 where the grant of a village is said to be sadhāngahiranyādeyah'. Here dhūnya (payment of tax in kind) is contradistinguished from payment in hiranya i, e, in cash (either gold, silver or copper). When Patañjali states that the Mauryas being greedy of 'biranya ' founded or manufactured images (Mahābhāşya vol. II. p. 429 on Pāṇ. V. 3. 99 quoted in H. Dh. vol. II p. 710 n. 1696 ) what is meant is that they wanted casb and not merely gold, 

165. The measures of capacity such as 376. Sper occur in the Mat. hura Ins, of Huviska (E. I. XXI. p. 55 at p. 61 ). According to Parāśara (VI. 70 ) two prasthas are equal to an adhaka and 32 prasthas are equal to a drona. The Mit. on Yāj. III. 275 quotes a verse to this effect: 8 mustis = one kifcit or kufici (acc. to some ), 8 kincit = puskala, 4 puşkalas = adhaka; 4 adhakas = drona and 16 dronas - khāri. Aparārka (pp. 305 and 846 ) quotes two verses (which the Par. M. II 1, p. 141 ascribes to the Bhavisya. purāna) which say: 2 palas = prasști, 2 prasstis kudava, 4 kudavas = prastha, 4 prasthas * adhaka, 4 adhakas = drona. 2 dronas = kumbha. The Danda. viveka p. 135 refers to this, adds that some held the kumbha to be equal to 20 dronas (Kauţ. II, 20 holds kumbha to be equal to 20 dronas ) and quotes the following verse from quingelorector: OTTATHN: 8:1 Gut für unter FA:' H. The word drona occurs even in the Rgveda in the sense of a wooden trough used for holding water or soma juice. Vide Rg. VI. 2,8, VI, 37.2. VI, 44,20, IX. 28,4 etc. In Rg. IV. 32. 17 the sage prays Indra to grant a hundred khāris of soma. The words ūdhaka and drona occur in the ardbarcadi group (Pān. II. 4. 31), Khari ia Pāņ, V 1. 33 and V. 4. 101. The Par. M. II. 1. 141 says on this difference about kumbha . $10 TET TUTTATTETE.' Kaut. (II. 19 p. 104 ) himself tells us that the measure drona was of four varieties, 162; palas, 175, 187} or 200 palas according as it was used for measurement in the barem, or for servants or for ordinary dealings or for royal income,

most about 9 or 10 miles (or only 4} or five miles according to the other reading). To hold that 10 silver panas were allowed to an ordinary data for going even ten miles (which he could cover in half a day or less ) would be too much. Hence also the paņas in Kaut. V. 3 are only copper ones. When once it is settled that the paņas are of copper, it easily follows that the salaries in papas were monthly. Artisans and craftsmen were, acc. to Kaut., to get 120 panas. If this were yearly, they would get only 10 paņas a month, while, according to Manu quoted above, even the lowest menial was to get a papa a day. Therefore 120 papas (of copper ) were the monthly salary of an artisan. A monthly salary is more natural and practical than a yearly one. Other ancient writers like Sankha-Likhita ( in Rājanitiprakasa p. 252 ) contemplate a monthly salary for soldiers (viz. two suvarpas a month ). 166 From the Nasik Inscription No. 12 (E. I.

A few words may be said about words like suvarna, satamāna, niska &c. The word krsnala occurs in the Tai. S II. 3. 2 1. Hiranyakāra ( goldsmith) is found in Vāj, S, 30. 17. In Rg. I. 126, 2 gifts of a hundred niskas and horses are mentioned and in Rg. IV. 37. 4 the Rbhus are address. ed as wearing 'good niskas'. In Atharva V. 14. 3 'niska' occurs and in the Ait. Br. (39.8) damsels who are niskakanthyah ( whose necks are adorn ed with necklaces of niskas) are among the gifts. So'niska' was probably a gold piece used as a coin or an ornament or a thin plate of gold like a modern putli, several of which are even now worn by women in the form of a necklace. In Rg. II. 33. 10 Rudra is said to wear 'visvarūpa-niska' which is probably an allusion to golden pieces stamped with various figures. In Rg. VI. 47. 23 the sage says that he received ten 'biranyapindas' (golden pieces ) from Divodāsa. In æg. VIII. 78. 2 a prayer is offered to Indra for the bestowal of golden. mana', which may be the precursor of Satamāna'. This last occurs in the Tai. S. VI. 6. 10. 2. Pan. (V. 1.27, 29, 30 ) respective ly mentions satamana ( what is bought for a satamāna is called sātamāna ), kārsāpana, niska and V. I. 34 refers to pana, pāda and māsa. Patañjali ( Mahābhāşya vol.

Hopkins in 'Position of the ruling caste' J, A, 0. S. vol. XIII. pp. 151-162 traces how the influence of the purohita grew. One cannot accept his views about there being three layers in the Mahābhārata and the conclusions from such dealing with the text that he draws, which are rather subjective, Gradually the importance of the purohita waned. As the Sukranitisāra cited above ( n. 150 ) shows, long before that work he came to be omitted by several writers from the council of ministers and was supplanted by the Pandita. The same func tions came to be exercised by an officer called dharmādhyaksa or dharmādhikaranika in Bengal and other countries. The Matsyapurāna ( 215.24) states the qualifications of a dharmadhi kūrin. 187 Vide E. I. vol. 14 p. 156 at p. 160 of the Naihati grant of Ballālasena, where we have both purohita and mahā dharmādhyaksa mentioned among the great functionaries of State and the Benares copper-plate of the Cedi king Karnadeva in 1042 A. D. in E. I vol. II, p. 309 where we have mahādharmādhi. karaṇika but no purohita. Besides another officer called sāmvatsara ( astrologer ) gradually took over some of the functions of the purohita. The Vişnudharmasūtra II. 75 (rājā ca sarvakāryeşu samvatsarādhinah syāt) requires the king to depend on the sāṁvatsara in all matters. The Bphat-samhitā (2.9) states that a king without a sāmvatsara mistakes his path like a blind man. Kām. 4.33 and Visņudharmottara II. 4. 5-16 recom mend reliance on him. Kautilya 17a IX, 4 was himself against too much reliance on astrology, while Yāj. I. 307 holds that the rise and fall of kings depend on the (aspects or influence of) planets.

Senāpati 

127 

Senüpati : The qualities of a commander-in-chief are stated in several places such as Kautilya (II. 33), Ayodhyā 100.30 (= Sabhā 5. 46 ), Santi 85, 31-32, Matsya 215. 8-10, Agnipurāna 220. 1 ff, Kām. XVIII. 27-44, Vişnudharmottara II. 24. 4-6, Mānasollasa II. %, verses 90-92 p. 37. Acc. to the Agni purāņa 220. 1, Matsya 215. 10 the commander-in-chief must be either a brāhmana or a kşatriya. Sukra ( II. 429-430 ) requires that a ksatriya should be preferred as senapati, but if a valiant kşatriya be not available a brāhmaṇa may be chosen, but a $ūdra should not be chosen. Acc. to the Mānasollāsa he should possess the following qualities : good family, character, courage, proficiency in (several) languages, cleverness in riding horses and elephants and in the science of arms, knowledge of omens and medicine, knowledge of the breeds of horses and of the difference between what is essential and non essential, liberality, sweet speech, self-control, intelligence, resoluteness. In the Mahābhārata senāpatis are elected and consecrated (vide Udyoga 151, Drona 5, Karna 10), but this was not so in later times. He is appointed by the king on his own initiative. 

Düla : ( Ambassador or messenger). The word and the office of data as messenger was known in the most ancient times. In Rg. I. 12.1, 1.161.3, VIII. 44.3 Agni is said to be the dūta and is requested to bring the gods to the sacrifice. There is also attached to the word the meaning of espionage, since Saramā, the bitch of the gods, is represented in Rg. X. 108. 2-4 as sent by Indra to find out the treasures of the Panis. The Udyogaparva (37.27, cr. ed. 37.25 ) specifies the eight qualities of a dūta viz. he must not be stiff-necked, nor timid, nor dilatory, he must be kind and amiable, not liable to be won over by others, free from diseases, endowed with a fine mode of speech. 169 Śānti 85.28 refers to seven qualities. Vide Ayodhyā 100.35, Manu VII. 63–64, Matsyapurāņa 215. 12-13 for the qualities of a dūta. The düta should speak only what he has been ordered (by his king) to speak, otherwise he would be liable to be killed (Udyogaparva 72.7, cr, ed. 70,7). Sānti 85. 26-27 say that the person of the data is sacred. Kautilya devotes one chapter (I. 16 ) to the treatment of the subject of data. He states that the data is to be sent by the king after the line of

History of Dharmaśāstra 

(Vol. 

policy has been settled at a council of ministers to the king who is to be attacked (vide Kām. XII. 1 also). A dūta is of three kinds : (1) nisrstārtha 1 (one to whom is entrusted full discretion as to what is to be said ) is one who is possessed of the qualifications required in a minister (amatya), such as Krona from the Pandavas or the ambassadors in modern times; (2) parimitārtha ( entrusted with a definite mission, an envoy ) who possesses the same qualifications as the first less by one quarter ; (3) $ūsanahara (a mere carrier of royal writings or missives ) who possesses only half the qualifications of the first. The Mit. on Yāj. I. 328 lucidly explains the three varieties. Kaut. dilates at great length on the qualifications of the data, what he has to note while in the enemy country, how he is to behave ( such as avoiding women and wine ), how he is to gather information through spies ; but all this has to be passed over for want of space. Vide Kām. XII. 2-24 for the same. Kām. (XII. 22-23 ) briefly sets out the following duties of the duta; determining those who are inimical to the king to whom he is sent, winning over to his side the friends and relatives of the enemy king, finding out the ( number and equipment of) forts, the economic resources and military strength of the enemy king, collection of news as to what the enemy intends to do, bringing over to his side the officers in charge of the districts of enemy country, collecting knowledge about the places of the enemy where battles can be waged by his king or whence he can pass away swiftly. Manu VII. 65 says that it is the data who brings about alliance or war. Kaut, says that when the ruler to whom the dūta is accredited becomes displeased at the message he brings, the dūta should reply 170 . All kings, you and others,' speak through their dūta. Therefore dūtas have to deliver the message entrusted to them even if weapons are raised ( to threaten them ); even the lowest caste dūtas (cāndālas) are not to be killed, what need be said about a dūta who is a

brāhmapa? This ( that I utter ) is the message of another. It is my duty to say it'. The Rāmāyaṇa ( V. 52. 14-15) says that good men do not allow the killing of a dūta, but certain modes of dealing with him ( viz. lashing him, shaving his head) are allowed in certain cases. 

A dūta is to be distinguished from a cura or cūra ( spy ), as done by Kaut., Kam, XII. 32, Yāj. I. 328. Kām. XII. 32 says that a duta is an open ( prakūša ) spy, while a caru is a spy who works in secret. In modern times also 'an ambassador is often nothing more than an honourable spy acting under the protect ion of the law of nations' (Encyclopædia Britannica on * espionage'). Kaut, devotes four chapters to spies (I. 11-14) and Kān. (XII. 25-49 ) also deals at great length with them. The Sukranstisāra (1. 334-336 ) states that the king should learn every day at night from his secret spies the intentions and actions of his subjects and officers, and the opinions of ministers, enemies, soldiers, the members of the assembly, relations and the women in the harem. The cart must, according to Kām. XII. 25, possess ability to infer the inner thoughts of men), must have a good memory, must be soft in speech, have quick gait, be capable of enduring privations and heavy labour, swift in action, ready-witted. Kaut. (I. 11 ) says !? that spies are those who work in the guise of a kāpxıtiku ( a bold pupil capable of know ing the minds of others ), ulāstluita (a sham ascetic, who has fallen from the real duties of asceticism and is endowed with intelligence and pure character), yrhaputika (a householder who is a cultivator that has not the means to maintain himself, has intelligence and is of pure character ), a wridehaka ( a trader who cannot maintain himself by trade and is possessed of intel ligence and pure character), a lūpnisu (a spy practising auste rities, who has either shaved his head or has matted hair and is desirous to maintain himself ), a class-mate or colleague (sattrin), a desperate character (tikşna), a poisoner and a female mendicant. The first five of these are called by Kautilya five sarnsthās (groups

(Vol. 

or institutions ), which should be honoured by the king with awards of money and marks of respect and through which the king is to test the purity of the character of his servants. Kautilya says that the spy called udāsthita should carry on agriculture, cattle-rearing and trade on land set apart for the purpose, should be supplied with plenty of gold and disciples and should afford to all (sham ) ascetics food, clothing and lodg ing, direct them to detect particular crimes and report. The spy called tāpasa was to stay near the capital, to have many pupils, to pretend to eat once in a month or two only a handful of vegetables or grass and eat secretly his favourite dishes. His disciples were to proclaim that he possessed supernatural powers, he should pretend to make predictions about gain or fires or fear from robbers after ascertaining from his pupils by nods and signs such events. In I 12 Kaut. deals with wandering spies ( called sancaru ) viz. sattrins (who are orphans that are to be maintained by the State and that are taught palmistry, sorcery, tricks of legerdemain &c.), tikşna (desperadoes who, regardless of their lives, may fight elephants for money), rasada ( who have no affection even for their relatives, are indolent and cruel), bhikṣuki or parivrājikā (a poor brāhmaṇa widow, clever and desirous to earn her livelihood, honoured in the king's harem and visiting the families of mahāmātras or high ministers). These are to spy on the 18 tirthas (mentioned on p. 112 above ) in public. For spying on their private character persons pretending to be hump-backed, dwarfs, kirātas (pigmies), the deaf and dumb, idiots, the blind, and others that are actors, dancers, singers and the like and women are to be employed. This information is to be tested by the persons belonging to the five sarnsthās ( mentioned above on p. 129 ), but these are to act without their being known by the wandering spies and vice versa. Then further testing by other spies follows. When the information received from these three sources tallies then it will be held reliable; if the information frequently disagrees, the spies should be secretly punished or discharged. A similar rule about sending several spies on the same mission without their knowing each other is laid down by Vişnudharmot tara II. 24. 66-67. Kaut, in I. 13 deals with espionage on subjects in general (i. e. those in the capital and other parts of the country ). Spies are to pretend to take sides, some praising the king as possessed of all good qualities, others qualifying that praise. They were also to report the rumours spreading among the people, to report whether there was discontent and the king was to honour those who were reported to be contented and to

bring round the discontented by conciliation, gifts, sowing dissensions among them or by punishing them. In. I 14 Kautilya deals with the employment of spies for taking advantage of parties in a foreign State i. e. groups of persons angry with the foreign king or afraid of him or of persons who are ambitious or proud, who are to be won over by appropriate words and stimuli. It will be seen how there was a network of spies of all kinds, so much so that Kām. XII. 28 declares that spies are the king's eyes ( caracakşur mahipatiḥ). The Vişnudharmottara II. 24.63 says the same ('rājānas-cāracakşuşaḥ ') and also Udyoga 34. 34. cāraih paśyanti rājānaḥ'. In IV. 4-6 Kautilya dilates 178 upon the employment by the samāhart; ( Collector) of a host of spies for suppressing those who are thorns (or disturbers of peace), these being employed for detecting judges ( dharmastha ) and superintendents of various departments that take bribes, counterfeiters of coins, adulterers, thieves and robbers and other criminals. Kautilya relies in extreme cases on spies even in the decision of judicial matters. He says (III. 1 last verse ) 'when owing to the depositions of witnesses the plaintiff's case and the defendant's case are both destroyed, when the cause of either of the parties is found through the spies to be false, then the decree shall be passed against that party'. 178 In Dronaparva 75.4 it is said that Krspa had his spies in the army of Duryodhana and vice versa (74.1). Sānti 69.8–12 and 140.39-42 mention the places where spies are to be set!? up and emphasizes that they should not know each ether. One need not feel surprised at the machinery of espion age that Kautilya. so elaborately describes. All governments in modern times employ spies, informers and secret agents to keep themselves informed of the activities, views and resources of their opponents. We know also how the Indian Police, in order to catch offenders against the Prevention of Gambling Act or other similar Acts, employ agents with marked coins or notes and draw in their net unsuspecting people.

RĀSTRA (THE TERRITORY OF A STATE) 

DDT WI 

The word 'rastra' occurs even in the Rgveda (IV. 42.1, 'mania dvitā rāstram kşatriyasya”)-‘mine is the kingdom on both sides (or in both spheres)' says king Trasadasyu. In Rg. VII. 34,11 Varuna is praised as the Lord of rāştras ( rājā rāştrāņām &c.). In Rg. VII. 84.2 and X. 109. 3 the word rāstra occurs. In a very famous benedictory 175 passage of the Tai. S. VII. 5. 18. 10 = Vāj. S. 22.22 ) one of the blessings invoked is 'may the king in this kingdom become brave, a skilled archer, and a great warrior', Vide Tai, Br. III. 8. 13 for explanation of the Tai, S. passage. In the Atharvaveda XII. 1. 8 and 10 the earth is called mother and invoked to impart to the rāştra strength and brilliance (or energy ). Kām. VI. 3 says 175 that since all the elements of the State spring from the territory of the State, the king should raise up his territory with all his efforts. The Agnipurāņa 239, 2 holds that rāştra is the most important of all elements of the State. Manu VII. 69 prescribes that a king should make his home in a country that is not water-logged (i. e. is dry and not moist ), 176 is rich in crops, inhabited mostly by Aryas (or well-conducted people), not disturbed ( by epidemics &c.), that is charming (owing to trees, flowers and fruits ), the chiefs in which have submitted to him and in which livelihood can be had easily. Yāj. I. 321 and Visnudharmasūtra III. 4-5 are to the same .effect. Kām. (IV. 50-56 ) remarks the territory of

The territory of the State

the king depends for its prosperity on the qualities of the soil, the prosperity of the territory tends to the prosperity of the king; therefore a king should choose for the sake of his prosperity land possessing good qualities. That land is prefer red for the sake of prosperity that is endowed with various crops and minerals, is full of merchandise, mines and various substances, that is favourable to cattle-rearing, that abounds in water, is inhabited by well-conducted people, is charming, has forests and elephants, has facilities of water and road transport and does not depend upon rain-water only.' 177 Land that is full of gravel and stones, full of forests always infested with thieves, that is waterless, full of thorny bushes and snakes is not fit for choosing as a rūštra. A country is to be preferred that yields livelihood easily, is possessed of the qualities of good land (cited above), is full of water, that has hills in it, that consists mostly of sūdras, artisans and merchants, the husbandmen in which undertake great projects, that is loyal (to the king ) and averse to the king's enemy, that can put up with troubles and taxes, that is large in extent, full of people from various countries, that follows the right path, that possesses plenty of cattle and wealth, the principal men in which are not foolish nor vicious. These requirements show that the country must be prosperous, well-stocked with the necessaries of life and well suited to defence. There is also some difference of opinion among the smrti writers about the composition of the population, Manu VII. 69 requires that the kingdom should consist mostly of aryas (āryaprāya), while Vişnu Dh. S. III. 5 holds that a country should be peopled mostly by vaiśyas and sūdras. In another place ( VIII. 22) Manu says that that country in which sūdras abound, which is full of atheists and void of dvijas is overwhelmed by disease and famine and perishes. Similar provisions are found in the Matsyapurana 217. 1-5, Vişnudharmottara II. 26. 1-5, Mānasol lasa (II. 3. verses 151-153), Nitivākyāmsta (Janapadasamud deśa p. 191 which defines rāştra, vişaya, deśa, janapada &c.). The Matsyapurāna 217. 5 and Vişnudharmottara II. 26.5, (pvainvidhain ynthālābham rajā vişny amāriset) point out that

overy rāştra cannot be expected to possess all the qualities mentioned by them and that the king must do the best with such qualities as his country possesses. Kautilya II. 1 advises 178 the king to found a district of villages either on old sites or on new ones by inducing people from other countries to immigrate or by causing thickly populated parts of his own country to send its overflowing population and to see that each village consists of not less than one hundred families nor more than five hundred, is peopled mostly by śüdra cultivators, has an extent of one krosa or two and is capable of offering help to its neighbours. 

According to Paurānic geography there are seven dvipas, viz. Jambu, Plakşa, Sālmala, Kuśa, Krauñca, Saka and Puskara (Visnupurāna II. 1. 11 ff) and each dvīpa is divided into varsas. Jambudvipa has 9 Varşas of which Bharatavarşa is the first (Visnupurāna II. 2. 12 ff). The Mahabharata speaks of 13 dvipas (Ādi. 75. 19, Vanaparva 3. 52 and 134. 20 ) and 18 dvipas also (Drona 70.15). For Bharatavarşa vide H. Dh. vol. II. pp. 17-18. Manu II. 20 looks upon the holy land of Kurukşetra, of the Matsyas, Pancalas and Sūrasenas as 'the chosen country' the learned brāhmaṇas in which were to be the leaders and guides of the whole world in appropriate thoughts and actions. The Vişņu ( II. 3.2), Brāhma, Mārkandeya 55. 21-22 and other purāņas proudly assert that Bharatavarga is the land of action (karmabhumi). This is patriotismı of a sort but not of the kind we see in western countries. Bharatavarşa itself has comprised numerous countries from the most ancient times. The names of countries and the tribes or people inhabiting them were the same (vide Pāṇini IV. 1. 168, 

178. भूतपूर्वमभूतपूर्व वा जनपद परदेशापवाहनेन स्वदेशाभियन्दव ममेन वा मि शयेत् । शुवकर्षकमायं कुलशतावरं पञ्चशतकुलपरं माम क्रोशद्धिकोसीमाममन्योन्यारक्षं 

Thanh Bugil II. 1. This passage clearly shows that Kauțilya at least employed the word janapada in the sense of a territory to be colonized and as one which was either included within the kingdom or not so included. Dr. Pran Nath's interpretation of janapada that it was only a part of the kingdom' (p. 47, Study in the economic condition of ancient India') cannot be accepted in view of the express words wagening. The usage of classical writers and the Purāņas shows that janapada means simply country' and Amara gives it as a synonym of ast and für and Mirat explains that 

are is called it. The Kāvyamimāmsā on which Dr. Pran Nath relies for the number of countries employs the word janapada for the names of the countries in the four quarters of India ( not for parts of any kingdom).

Turvašas, Druhyus, Anus and Pūrus (Rg. 1. 108, 8, VIII. 10.5 &c.) and the countries of Cedi (VIII. 5. 39), Kikata ( III. 53, 4), Rjika ( VIII. 7. 29), Rusama ( V. 30.12 ), Vetasu (X. 49, 4). In the Atharvaveda V, 22 several peoples or countries are mention ed of which Bahlikas (in vv 5 and 9), Müjayat (vv 5 and 8), Gandhāri, Anga, Magadha ( in v. 14) deserve notice. The Ait. Br. (38. 3) divides India into five divisions in the east, south, west and north ( the Uttara Kurus and Uttara Madras ) and in the centre (Kuru-Pancāla and Vasa-Ušinara ). India was divided into two parts, Dakşiņāpatba (from the Narmadā southwards ) and Uttarāpatha at least some centuries before Christ, since the Hāthigumphā Ins. (E. I. vol. 20 at p. 79 ) mentions a great many kings of Uttarāpatha and the Maha bhāsya refers to lakes in Dakşiņāpatha." In the Brāhmaṇas frequent mention is made of the Kuru-Pañcālas (Tai, Br. 1.8. 4), Uttarakuru, Uttara-madra, Kuru-Pañcālas, Vaśa-Usinaras (in Ait. Br. 38.3), Kuru-Pancālas, Anga-Magadhas, Kāśi-Košalas, Sālva-Matsyas, Vaśa-Ušinaras in Gopatha II. 10(ed. by Gastra ). The Gandhāras occur in Chandogya Up. (VI. 14. 1), Videha in Bṛ. Up. III. 1. 1, Madras in Bp.Up. III. 3.1. In the Maha bhārata there are long lists of countries in various connections, which are more than 200 (e. g. Sabhā 4. 21-32, 20. 26-30, Sabhā 25 ff, Sabhā 52. 13-19,53. 5-9, Virāta 1. 12-13, Bhişma. 9. 39-69, 50.47-53, Droņa 11.15-18, 70.11-13, Aśvamedhika 73-78, 83.10 ff.) The Baudhāyana-gļhyaśeşasūtra 1. 17 prescribes a mandala for the worship of the Sun and names nine countries in the eight directions and in the centre as representatives. The Purānas also contain long lists of countries e. g. Matsya 114, 34-56, Mārkandeya 57.32-67 and chap. 58, Brāhma 17.10-15 and 25.25-39. The same country sometimes has two names (e. g. Vidarbha and Krathakaišika denote the same country in Raghuvamsa VIL 1 and 32). “Buddhist India'(by Rhys Davids p. 23) mentions the sixteen peoples (or countries), lists of which occur in the Anguttaranjkāya I. p. 213, IV. p. 252 and in the Dighanikāya 

179. The ATITTOU dames at least the following countries: stāl: sy, 9748, spa, Tamo sfr, A, T, E, FRIT, Fist. Pra, 94, 75, 76, prourt, afuga, igra, qatt, 5, ara, as, TIIS, T, U, \#U, AF, APE, ATU, grut, , frau, face, yht, farra, &, mitte. Some countries like so , M5AE, , ruist, 95,

Varaha mihira's Bțhatsaṁhitā, Baudhāyana-gphyasesasūtra 1. 17, Kāmagūtra V.6. 33-41, Bārhaspatya Arthasāstra (II. 83-117), the Kāvyamimāṁsā of Rajasekhara (17th chapter) name numerous countries. This last divides India into five regions and gives the names of about 70 countries in the four directions but none from Central India. The Bhāvaprakāśana (pp. 309-310) gives a list of 64 countries and states that Dakşiņāpatha (Deccan) is a fourth of Bharatavarşa and that in the Tretā and Dvāpara ages people afraid of being overwhelmed by ice came down to the south, 1784 56 countries are named in some Tantra works (vide 'Indian Culture' vol. VIII. p. 33). In the lexicon called Vaijayanti of Yadavaprakāśa (11th century A.D.) edited by Dr. G. Oppert, over a hundred countries and capitals of some of the countries are named (in the Bhūmikānda and chapter on deśa thereof). 

To constitute a rāstra a territory of some size and a large population are required. There can hardly be a rāstra of a few villages or a few hundred inhabitants. The boundaries of the numerous countries mentioned in the works cited above must have been fluid and must have changed from country to 

country owing to conquests. 

In ancient India the modern sentiment of nationalism had hardly taken root. Writers speak of rājya ( State ) and of rāstra ( territory ) as an element of rājya. They had no sense of 'nationality nor did they seriously work for national unity. The modern idea of a nation is more a question of feeling and senti inent than of objective fact. The State has been at all times a great co-ordinating agency, but as its boundaries were extremely variable in ancient India, the modern sentiment of nationality, of 'my country, right or wrong' hardly ever arose in India (except perhaps for over a century in Maharastra in the 17th and 18th centuries and among the Sikhs). In the whole of Hindu India, there was no doubt a certain unity of religion, philosophy, literary forms and conventions of arts and forms of worship, and in reverence for holy places, but this did not make for a deep seated and effective sentiment of nationhood or national unity.

Sentiment of nationality 

137 

Most of the ancient sūtrakāras and smftis try to lay down the limits of the holy land of Aryāvarta and differentiate it from the lands of mlecchas. Vide H. of Dh. vol. II. pp. 11-18. The Vişnu (II. 3. 1-2), Mārkandeya (55. 21) and other purāņas wax eloquent over the inportance of Bharatavarga and describe it as the land of action for those who want to secure heaven or final release or as the land where alone sin and religious merit were to be found ( karmabhūmir-iyam svargan-apavargam ca gacchatām or tat-karma bhūmir-nünyatra samprūptih punyapāpayoh in Mārk.). Manu (II. 20) manifests great pride in and love for the holy countries of Brahmāvarta, Kuruksetra, Matsya, Pañcāla and Sūrasena by glorifying the brāhmanas of these countries as those from whom all men on this broad earth should learn the actions and usages appropriate to them'. Vas. I. 10 also says the same. Sankha Likhita (q. by Visvarūpa on Yāj. I. 2) hold that the country of Āryāvarta is endowed with high qualities, is ancient and holy (desa Aryo guravān ...... sinātanah punyah). As however the smptis were composed at different times, embodied the usages of different provinces in India and as they provided for the observances of all those who followed the Veda, they do not generally lay emphasis on localities but rather on what they thought was common to all Aryas in India (yat tu samūnam tad vakşyünah, as Āśv. gṛ, says). There was no doubt a great emotional regard for Bharatavarşa or Aryavarta as a unity for many centuries among all writers from a religious point of view, though not from a political standpoint. Therefore one element of modern nationhood viz. being under the same government was wanting. But it must be noted that from very ancient times there was always the aspiration among great kings and the people to bring the whole of Bharatavarga "under one umbrella". Even in the West the sentiment of nationality practically arose after the partition of Poland, and as a conse quence of the French Revolution and of the Industrial revolution, which led manufacturing countries to search for markets and to exploit backward and less developed peoples. Vide Laski's 'Grammar, of Politics' chap. VI. Modern nationalism un doubtedly leads to great self-sacrifice and produces certain virtues of high value in the individuals that are fired by that sentiment. But the ideals of the modern nation States are not high, particularly in their treatment of other peoples and in their attitude towards less favoured States. The one aim of the leading politicians of modern nation States and most of the inhabitants of these States seems to be to raise the standard of 

18

(Vol. 

living of their citizens to a high level and to maintain it at that level even by exploiting and robbing weaker races and lands. This is not the place to discuss these matters further. Whatever the value of nationalism to the individuals fired by it may be, from the point of the welfare of the whole of mankind, modern nation States do not deserve to survive, unless the so called progressive nation States are prepared to give up their racial pride, their spirit of grabbing and exploitation and to extend a brotherly hand to all struggling States to improve themselves in their own way and attain to higher standards of living without let or hindrance. It cannot be gainsaid that for several centuries in the past and also at the present moment all modern nation States have two moralities, one for their own nation and the other for their dealings with foreign States and races. 

Some remarks must now be made about provincial and local administration. Each kingdom comprised deśas (countries) and subdivisions of deśas. The governor of a rāstra was called rāştrapati or rāştriya. Vide p. 117 above about Puşyagupta hav ing been the rāştriya of Surāştra (Kathiawad) under Candragupta Maurya and Sānti 85. 12 (which describes what the rāştriya is to do ). 

According to the Amarakośa the words desa, rāstra, visaya and janapada are synonyms. Epigraphic usage is not uniform about the dimensions of these. Sometimes visaya appears to be a sub-division of deśa (vide the words “rāstrapati-vişayapati grāmakūta' in I. A, vol. VIII. at p. 20 in the grant of Cālukya Tribhuvanamalla in sake 999 and I. A, vol. XII pp. 247, 251 in the grant of Rāştrakūta Govinda in sāke 855). But in the Hirahada galli plates (E. I. vol. I. p. 5) 'vişaya' occurs first and then 'rāştra'; so it appears that there' visaya' is deemed to be larger than rāstra. According to the Sahyadrikhanda ( uttarārdha, chap. 4) deśa is made up of 100 villages, mandala is made up of 4 deśas, a khanda of 100 mandalas and the earth has nine khandas. 180 From the Cambay plate of sake 852 (930 A. D.), we see that mandala was a sub-division of deśa (E. I. vol. 7 p. 26, at p. 40). From

Subdivisions of rūštra 

139 

the Bangarh grant of Mahipāla I (E. I. vol. 14 p. 324) and the Amgachhi plate of Vigrahapālā II we see that mandala was smaller than vişaya which again was a subdivision of 'bhukti'. The word' bhoga' (which is similar in origin to 'bhukti') appears to be applied to a sub-division of visaya (which in its turn is a sub-division of rāstra ) in the Bhamdak 181 plate of Krsnarāja I dated sake 694 (E. I. 14 p. 121, 126 ) and also in the Jejuri plates of Vinayāditya in 609 sake ( E. I. vol. 19 p. 62 at p. 64 where the word 'rastrapati' does not occur). The Mitākşarā on Yāj. I. 319 explains that only a king (mahipati ) can make a grant of land and not a bhogapati (i. e. the officer over a bhoga). Another ancient word for a division of a country is āhārı which occurs in the Rupnath Rock inscription and Sarnath pillar Edict of Asoka (Corpus I. I. vol. I pp. 162 and 166 ), in the Nasik Inscriptions No. 3 and 12 (Govardhanāhāra and Kāpurāhāra, E. I. vol. VIII pp. 65 and 82 ) and in the Karle 

Ins. No. 19 (E. I. VII. p. 64 ) where we have Mamalāhāra, modern Māval ( in Poona District ). For want of space it is not possible to pursue this subject here. For further information vide Dr. Fleet in J. R. A. S. for 1912 p. 707 and my paper on * the Ancient Geography of Mahārāstra' (JBBRAS. vol. XXIV for 1914-1917 pp. 648-653 ). In the epigraphic records particularly of the Deccan and South India we come across names of territorial divisions to which small as well as very large figures (indicat ing the number of villages they comprised) are affixed: e. g. a group of twelve villages in Aparānta on the sea near Kalvivana (modern Kelvem) is mentioned in the Sanjan plates of Bud dhavarasa ( E. I. 14 p. 144 at p. 150 ), Nyayapadra saptadaša in Bhoja's grant in sarnvat 1076 (E. I. 18 at p. 322), Kisukād 70 (E. I. 15 p. 73), Beļvola 300 ( in E.

Kautilya II. 1 says that in the kingdom groups of villages should be set up with a chief town or fort in each, a group of ten villages being called Sangrahaņa, of two hundred villages being called Khāryaţika, of 400 villages being called Drona mukha, and in the midst of 800 villages 188 there is the Sthaniya.

Furafit has a similarity in sound and meaning to modern thānā, Dr. Pran Nath (in Study of the economic condition of Ancient India' p. 26 ) priocipally relying on a commentator of the Jain works called Prajñāpaoopānga ( which he misunderstands:) holds that grāma' does not mean 'a village', but 'an estate or survey village which can pay 18 kinds of Government taxes'. The learned Doctor says that he consulted many Sanskrit lexicons, but did not find this interpretation in any one of them. That should bave induced him to be cautious. But he makes the bold and facile assumption that lexicons were compiled from a literary view.point and are not of much assistance as far as the technical meanings of words are concerned'. His great authority, the Jaio commentator, says ' 

T H E Nunta Tala witryon na MTA: of 10: TEHETSARTE 

TOMTAR IA:'. Dr. Pran Nath's Jain authority is no better than texicographers and their commentators. Turit on Amara derives grāma as a HITHTA:' i. e, the word yra is derived from the root ra. The Jain commentator first derives the word of\# from 7 and then from 7. Dr. Pran Nath forgets that a fanciful or scholastic derivation is not a definition. The rest of the reasoning on the new meaning of grāma is on a par with this and cannot be examined in detail. A commentator expressly states (ibid p. 27) that he gives only the vyutpatti (etymology) of grāma, but Dr. Prān Nāth pays no heed to this. He has not correctly grasped the scholastic discussion in the commentary quoted on p. 27. He misunder stands the word 'samagrāwāh'in Yaj. II. 152. The Amarakośa expressly says that sama' and 'samāna ' are synonyms. He is often very dogmatic without looking into all ancient and medieval authorities e. g. on p. 51 he charges Dr. Fleet with misinterpretation of a jātaka text (addha-tiyani satani) which Dr. Fleet translated as 250, while Dr. Prān Nāth is sure that the meaning is · 150'. He probably never noticed that so far back as the 2nd century B. C. the Mahābhāsya had explained the word 'ardhatrtiya' as Dr. Fleet does ( Brill arqagt or pu fa71:, vide Kielhorn, vol I. p. 426 on vārtika 22 on Pān. II. 2. 24). There is hardly any warrent for Dr. Prān Nātb's assertion that each grāma (as interpreted by him) contained only about five families and had only about 15 or 20 acres of cropped area (pp. 39-40). Kauț. (note 178 ) states that a grāma contains from 100

Manu VII. 114 similarly observes that in the midst of two, three or five villages the king should place a central post of guards called 'gulma' and another called 'sangraha' in the midst of a hundred villages. Manu VII. 115-117, Vişņudharma sütra III. 7-14, Santi 87.3ff, Agnipurāņa 223. 1-4, Visnudharmot tara II. 61. 1-6, Mānasollāsa II. %. 159-162 (p. 43) require the king to appoint a hierarchy of officers for one village, for groups of ten, twenty, hundred and thousand villages, who are to report what is wrong within their jurisdictions that they cannot themselves remedy to the officer next in grade above themselves and Manu VII. 120 prescribes that a minister of the king should supervise the doings and conflicts of all these officers. The Edicts of Asoka show that he had to employ a hierarchy of officers such as the mahāmātras, the yuktas and rājukas for the administration of his vast empire. A similar administrative system seems to have been continued under the Gupta Emperors. From the Damodarpur, Baigram and other plates (E. I. XV. p. 113, E. I. XVII. pp. 345ff, E. I. XXI. p. 78 ) it appears that the Provincial Governors were appointed by the Gupta Emperor himself and were called uparika mahārāja, that either the Governors or Emperors appointed District officers (visayapati) who were often called Kumārāmātya, that the District officers were aided in their administrative work by a board of four advisers called nagara-śreşthin (banker), sārthavāha (chief merchant), prathamakulika (chief of craft guilds) and prathama kāyastha (chief secretary), that the District officer had his 

(Continued from last page) very detailed and accurate boundaries of a village of 200 nivartanas are given. A nivartana was equal to a square of twenty vanisas on each side, each vamsa being equal to ten cubits; so that a nivartana covered an area of 40000 cubits (200 x 200) i, e, about 90000 square feet, while an acre is equal to 43560 square feet. Therefore the village referred to in the above grant was over 400 acres in extent. The Mahābhāşya (on vārtika 8 on Pan. I. 1. 7) has an interesting discussion on the several meanings of the word grāma in popular language viz. a number of houses (as in the grāma was burnt), the village wall or ditch (as in 'he entered the grāma'), 'men' (as in the grāma had gone'), & village with its forests and bushes, with its boundaries (such as rivers and hills) and with embaoked fields (as in 'a grāma was acquired').

headquarters in a place called adhişthāna and had his several offices or courts (adhikaranas), and that in sales of lands revenue officers called pustapülas (keepers of records of rights ) were consulted and had to report. In E. I. vol. XVII. pp. 345, 348 a copperplate of Kumāragupta I has 

grāmāsta-kulādhikaraṇam' which means an office having jurisdiction over 8 villages. Manu VII. 119 says that the officer over 10 villages was to have as his salary a kula of land and kula is here said to mean (by Kullūka) as much land as is ploughed by two ploughs having six oxen yoked to each. The Vaijayanti on Vişnu Dh. S. III. 15 says “kulam haladvaya karsaniyā bhūh! Sukra (I. 191-192) states that the lord of one hundred grāmas is called sāmanta, an officer appointed by a king over one hundred villages is called anusāmanta, one over ten villages is called nāyaka ( compare modern' naik'). Manu VII. 61 and 81, Yāj. I. 322, Kām. V. 75, Vişnudharmasūtra III. 16-21, Visņudharmottara II. 24. 48-49 say that the king should appoint as many adhyakşas ( superintendents) as are required for the several departments of the state, who are clever, honest and of good family. Kautilya 188 IL-9 prescribes ' those who are possessed of the qualifications for amātyas (cited on p. 107 above) should be appointed, according to their abilities, as superinten dents of the various departments and the king should constantly examine their work, since men are naturally fickle-minded and when appointed to do work exhibit like horses change of temper'. It is pointed out in works like the Visņudharmasūtra III. 16-21 and the Vişnudharmottara II. 24. 48–49, Sānti 69, 29, that those who are highly devoted to dharma should be appointed to the ecclesiastical or judicial department, the brave ones to military work, those who are skilled to revenue work and those who are very trustworthy should be placed in charge of mines, salts, toll-gates, ferries, elephant forests. 

Kautilya in his 2nd adhikarana exhaustively deals with the work done in 28 departments and the duties of their superin tendents. He enters into very minute details about each and his work is encyclopaedic in character on this subject.

Kautilya's work became the authority on Government and several inscriptions mention officers appointed according to the section on 'adhyakşapracāra', which is undoubtedly a reference to Kautilya's 2nd adhikarana. For example, in the Belava plate of Bhojavarmadeva (E. I vol. XII. at p. 40) and in the Barrackpur grant of Vijayasena (E. I. vol. XV. p. 283 ) we have the words 'angāmsca sakala rājapādopajivinodhyakşapracāroktın ihākirtitān cattabhata jātiyān janapadan kşetrakarāṁsca'. It is not possible to do anything more than indicate very briefly the sphere of each adhyakşa. The duty of the sannidhātr (1). 5) is to look after the construc tion of the treasury house, the store-houses for merchandise, for grain, for forest produce, for arms and of the jail. The samāhartr (the Collector-General) is to exercise superintendence over the collection of revenue from forts, the rural parts, mines, embank ments, forests, herds of cattle and roads for traffic ( II. 6). The samāhartr 184 has to divide (II. 35) the kingdom into four districts and to arrange the villages into three grades, viz. those that are exempted from taxes, those that supply soldiers and those that pay taxes in the form of grain, cattle, money, forest produce, free labour and other equivalents for taxes. It is the duty of the gopa to look after a group of five or ten villages under the orders of the samāharts. The gopa has not only to register the total number of the inhabitants of all varpas in the houses that pay taxes and that are exempt in the villages, but also to keep a register of the number of cultivators, cowherds, merchants, artisans, labourers, slaves, biped and quadruped animals, of the amount of monoy, free labour, tolls and fines that are recovered, and the number of women, men, young and old persons, and the extent of their actions, occupations, usages, expenditures. The sthānika (in charge of each of the four districts) should look after his charge in the same way. The superintendent of records and accounts (aksapatalādhyaksa ) should have the account office constructed with its door facing the north or the east, with rooms 

184, Both the samāharts and the sannidhāts are mentioned as officers in the copperplate of Mahābhavagupta of Trikalinga (E. I. vol. VIII. p. 138 at p. 141 and E. I, vol. XI at p. 94). Sabara in his bhāsya on Jaimini XII. 1. 28 refers to the samāharts coming with his own phalanx of subordinates 'यथा सेनापतिर्भस्यबलेन सहागतः समाइर्मा निजेन बलेन राजा त सबलस्तैश्चान्यैश्च। From Hiquen Thsang's account of his travels (Beal's · Buddhist Records' vol. I. p. 78 ) we learn that each province kept a record of good and bad events.

(for the clerks) set apart and with shelves of account books well arranged (II. 7). This officer had to enter numerous matters in the accounts, recover the king's dues from the sureties of servants, to check onbezzlement and to recover fines for loss due to neglect or fraud. The account year ended with the full moon of Aşadha, the year being of 354 days and the salary for an intercalary month being separately paid. Among the duties of the Superintendent of records and accounts was the important one of noting in his register the dharma, method of judicial procedure and the usages of countries, villages, castes, families and corporations ( desagrāmajāti-kulasanghātānām dharma. vyavahāra-caritra-samsthānam ............ nibandha-pustakastham kārayet). In II. 8 Kautilya specifies forty modes of embezzle ment by Government servants ( to which a reference is made in the Dasakumāracarita VIII ). In II. 9 he employs the picturesque figure that it is not possible to know exactly how officers appointed to the several businesses of the State extract wealth, just as fish always dwelling in water cannot be observed when they drink water. The superintendent of treasury (II. 11) shall in the presence of qualified persons receives into the treasury gems, pearls, articles of great or small value and forest produce (like sandal wood, (ugaru etc.). The superintendent of minos and of government manufactories (II. 12 ) must be proficient in the science of metals, mercury, liquids that ooze from the holes, caves and sides of mountains and hills. Under him are officers called lohādhyaksa ( who carries on the manu facture of vessels of copper and other metals ), a lakşanādhyaksa ( a superintendent of mint, who manufactures silver and copper coins for the State ), a rûpaduršaka 1844 ( examiner of coins, who regulates the dealings with paņas as a medium of exchange among the people and for stocking in the treasury), khanyadhyakşa ( who attends to conches, diamonds, pearls, coral and trade in them), a lavaņādhyakşa ( superintendent of salt). The suvarņā dhyaksa (the superintendent of gold) has to construct a goldsmith's office for the manufacture of gold and silver articles with a single door and four halls, to appoint a skilful and trustworthy goldsmith to have a shop in the centre of the road (II. 13 ) and not to allow any one who is not an employee to

enter the goldsmith's shop. If any one so entered he was to be beheaded. The State goldsmith (II. 14) has to manufacture gold and silver coins for the citizens and rural inhabitants through artisans employed by him. The superintendent of the storehouse (II. 15 ) has to keep together the produce of crown lands, taxes from the country districts, accidental revenue, manufacture of rice, oil &c. The superintendent of commerce ( panyādhyakşa, II. 16 ) should keep himself acquainted with the demand or absence of demand for and the rise and fall in the prices of various kinds of merchandise produced on land or from water and brought by land or water routes. The superintendent of forest produce (kūpyādhyaksa, II. 17 ) was to collect forest produce through guards of forest and Kautilya gives a long list of trees, varieties of bamboos, creepers, fibrous plants and rope making material, drugs and poisons, skins of various animals, that came under this officer's care. The superintendent of armoury (āyudhāgārādhyakşa, II. 18 ) was to employ experienc ed artisans to manufacture arms, wheels, machines, armour &c. required in battle or for the defence of forts, or for battering the cities of the enemy. The superintendent of weights and measures 185 was to get manufactured weights from half mūşaka 

185. The weights specified are: 10 seeds of māsa or 5 guñjās=1 suvarna. māsaka, 16 suvarna-masakas =one suvarna or karsa, 4 karsas one pala. 88 white mustard seeds=one rūpyamāsaka, 16 rüpyamāsakas or 20 saibya seeds =one dharana. The Kāsikā on Pān. II, 4.21 furnishes the interesting item of information that weights and measures (probably in vogue in its day) were first introduced by the Nandas (pandopakramāņi mānāni). The chief measures of distance given in II. 20 are: 8 atoms=one particle of dust thrown up by a chariot wheel, 8 particles = likṣā, 8 liks as a medium-sized yükā (louse), 8 yūkās =yava (barley corn) of medium size, 8 yavas - one angula, 12 angulas - vitasti, 2 vitastis = aratai or one prājāpatya hand, 2 vitastis plus 4 angulas (called dhanurgraha)=one hasta used in measuring pastures and cubic measures, 4 aratnis danda or dhanus or nālikā-paurusa, 10 dandas -rajju, 3 rajjus = nivartana, 1000 dbanus (or 2000 acc. to another reading) =goruta, 4 gorutas= one yojana. A nivartana was probably so called because it represented a day's ploughing by a team of eight or six oxen (from the root vrt with ni), meaning the area from which they stopped after a day's work. Vide H. of Dh. vol. II. p. 859 note 2021 for nivartana and gocarma. The extent of the nivartana differed acc. to different authorities. The Matsya said it was 30 dandas square, each danda being of the length of seveo hastas, while Sātātapa held the danda to be of 10 bastas, The Lilāvati (1.7 ) held that a pivartana was 20 vamsas square, each vamsa being of 10 hastas. According to the lexicon Vaijayanti, in Kosala the yojana was of four gavyūtis, while

onwards up to one hundred suvarpas, weights being made of iron or stones found in the Magadha country and the Mekala mountain. The superintendent of tolls (sulkādhyakşa, II. 21 ) was to erect near the principal gate of the capital a toll-house and its flag and when traders arrived with merchandise make four or five toll-collectors take down their names, whence they came, what merchandise they brought and whether it bore seal mark. In II. 22 Kautilya specifies various rates of tolls for imports and exports. The superintendent of weaving (II. 23) was to employ qualified persons to make threads, coats ( of armour ), cloths and ropes and he was to employ for cutting wool, fibres, cotton, hemp and flax, widows, cripple women, girls, ascetic women paying off fines by doing work, mothers of prostitutes, old women servants of the palace, devadāsis ( temple girls) who have ceased to do temple services. This superintendent was charged with the task of providing work for women who do not leave their homes, the wives of persons who have gone abroad, women who are cripple or unmarried and who have to work for their own maintenance. He was to give to them spinn ing work through the maid-servants in his department. If he stared at their faces when they came to exchange their work for wages or spoke to them on any other matter he was fined in the first amercement. Thus the State helped home or cottage industry. It is to be noted that he had large powers of levying fines and 

(Continued from the last page) in Magadha it was only equal to two gavyūtis (last verse of desądhyāya in bhumikhanda). Kaut. gives hastas of various lengths for various purposes, Compare Mapu VIII. 132-134, Vişnudharmasūtra IV. 1-7, Yāj. I. 362-363, Nārada parisista 57-60, Brhatsamhitā, 57. 1 ff, Vāyupurāna 101.118 for some of these, which differ in some details from Kautilya's statements. Kaut. (11, 20) states the duration of a nūdikā to be the time required for the passage of one ādhaka of water from a pot through an aperture of the same diameter as a wire of 4 angulas in length and made out of four suvarnamāsakas, 2 nādikās are equal to a muhurta and 15 mubūrtas are equal to a day or a night. In II. 19 he gives measures of corn as follows: 4 kudumbas = prastha, 4 prasthas = adhaka, 4 ādhakas = droña, 16 dronas = kbāri, 20 droņas -- kumbha. The drona differed for various purposes. Vide above (p. 124 note 165) for a quotation from Mit, on Yaj. III. 274. Hemadri, vratakhanda pp. 51-57, gives quotations from various sources for measures of time, corn &c. These measures were different in different countries and at different times. The Lilāvati (of 12th century A.D.) I. 7 speaks of the khāri in Magadha being equal to 16 dronas. Vide n. 165 above and H. of Db. vol. II. p. 881 2. 2053 and L. D. Barnett's 'Antiquities of India' (pp. 206-210) for tables of weights and measures.

awarding bodily punishments e. g. if a woman refused to work after receiving the wages he could cut off her thumb (? or bind up her thumb with the index finger so as to form a pair of tongs ). The superintendent of agriculture (sitādhyakşa, 186 II. 24) himself knowing or assisted by those who know the science of agriculture and the Ayurveda ( the ancient lore ) of trees was to collect at the proper times all kinds of corn, flowers, fruits, vegetables, bulbs, hemp and cotton seeds and to employ slaves, labourers and prisoners who worked to pay off fines they could not pay, to sow seeds on crown lands. In this chapter he makes interesting remarks about the extent of rainfall viz. the rainfall in a jāngala country (defined above at p. 132) is 16 droņas, in anūpu (very moist) countries 24 dronas, 131 dronas in the Aśmaka country (modern Khandesh and part of Berar ), 23 droņas in the Avanti country (round about modern Ujjain), an immense quantity in the Aparāntas ( west coast of India ) and the Himālayan regions. 

The superintendent of liquor was to carry on the traffic in liquor and ferments in the capital, the other parts of the country and in army camps by employing men familiar with them, he was to impose a fine of 600 paņas if any one other than the manufacturers, licensed vendors and vendees sold or purchased liquor, he was not to allow liquor-shops to be opened close to each other, he was to see that liquor was sold in small quantities such as or of a kudumba or a half prastha to persons of known character in order that ( lit. for fear) workmen employed should not cause loss through carelessness, that āryas might not violate the rules of good conduct and that desperadoes should not commit indiscreet acts. Sukra was even more strict as regards 

186. Sitā, according to the Amarakośa, means the lines or furrow made by the ploughshare'. Therefore Kautilya appears to employ the word 

• sitā' in the sense of land that has been cultivated'. Prof V. K. Ran. chandra Dikshitar (in 'Hindu Administrative Institutions. p. 369 ) is not right when he explains FIAT MI5Wara: (of Amara) as' methods and means connected with the plough'. Paddhati only means the line or furrow made in the field by the ploughshare. Kșiraswāmi explains as they ar e T. In II. 15 Kautilya himself explains. sitā 'as the collection of grain brought in by the superintendent of agriculture TUTTI: Ffradra: . The sitadhyaksa appears to have been concerned with crown lands, while the share of crops leviable on lands of private ownership was called 'bali'. Both these were the concern of the samāhartṛ as stated in V, 1. ( where rāstra is said to include sitā, bhāga, bali, kara &c.). When in II. 15 sitā and rāspra are separately mentioned that is on the analogy of the maxim of brāhman aśramana or of gobalivarda.

wine, as he did not allow any one to drink wine in the day-time (IV. 4. 43). The superintendent of slaughter houses ( sünk dhyakşa, II. 26 ) was entrusted with the power to regulate the killing of animals for meat and was to impose the highest amerce ment on those who trapped or beat or killed deer, cattle, birds or fish which were declared to be under State protection or that dwelt in protected forests. The superintendent of nautch-girls (ganikādhyaksa 187 ) is dealt with in II. 27. The topic of vetyās has already been treated of in H. Dh. vol. II. pp. 637-639. Kaut, says that a gaạika was to be employed for a salary of one thousand panas, whether she was born in a prostitute's family or not and she was to possess beauty, youth and accomplish ments (i. e. the 64 kalās enumerated in Kāmasūtra 1. 3. 16). Kaut, prescribes that, if she left the country or died, her daughter or sister took her place and estate or her mother could substitute some other gaṇikā in her place; when none of these existed the king took her wealth and her son did not inherit her wealth. A gaạikā could purchase her freedom by paying to the king 24000 paņas as ransom. She was to hold the umbrella, the golden pitcher and the fan for the king when he was seated on the throne or in a chariot or in his palanquin. There were grades among the gapikās as best, middling and inferior and salaries differed by a thousand. The sons of prostitutes were to be the chief actors on the royal stage. It appears from these provisions that the vesyas were more or less slaves. The superintendent of ships (nāvadhyakşa, II, 28 ) was to look after the passage of ships not only over the seas and at the mouths of rivers, but also over lakes and rivers in the sthāniya ( vide above p. 140 ) and other sub-divisions of the kingdom. Kaut. prescribes that villages on the sea-shore and river banks were to pay a fixed tax, fishermen were to render a sixth part of the haul of fish as fees for fishing licenses and merchants were to pay the customary tolls levied in port towns. This superintendent was to request the ships that touched at a harbour on their voyage to a distant port to pay the toll, he was to destroy pirate vessels bound for the country of an enemy as well as those that violated the usages of the port. The superintendent of cattle ( II. 29) was entrusted with the rearing,

preservation and care of cows, bulls, buffaloes and the dairy produce. The superintendent of horses ( II. 30) was to record the breed, age, colour, marks, groups and places of origin of horses, which were to be classified as those kept in salehouses for sale, those that were recently purchased, those captured in battles, those that were pledged and those temporarily kept in stables &c. Kaut. notes that the breed of horses from Kāmbhoja, Sindhu (modern Sindh), Aratta ( western Punjab ) and Vanāyu (North west of India ) countries are the best of horses, Bāhlika (modern Balkh), Pāpeya, Sauvira (eastern Sindh and western Rajputana) and Taitila breeds are of middle quality and the rest are inferior. The superintendent of elephants ( II. 31 ) had to take steps to guard elephant forests and supervise elephants that were in stables, the catching, training and feeding of them, their accoutrements &c. Kaut. devotes one chapter (II. 32 ) to the training and classification of elephants and medical treatment when they fell ill. The superintendent of chariots and that of infantry ( II. 33 ) have the charge of the chariot department and of the six classes of infantry respectively. The superintendent of passports ( mudrādhyakşa ) issued passes to inhabitants of the country or foreigners for entering into or going out and the superintendent of pastures (II. 34 ) was to see the passes and devote himself to the care of pastures. Kautilya provides that a pass (mudrā ) was to be given on payment of a māşaka, that one could enter into or go out of a country only when one had a pass, that a person who entered without a pass was to be fined twelve paņas and that the superintendent of pastures and his men were to examine whether persons not going by the royal road but through pastures had a pass or not and that the superintendent of pastures and his men were to convey the approach of thieves and enemies by beating drums and blowing conches and were to send messages about the entrance of enemies into pastures by means of domesticated pigeons carrying letters bear ing the official stamp or by means of smoke and fire. The nāgaraka ( the mayor of the capital or cities or the chief of the police in the capital ) was to look to the affairs of the capital ( or the big cities ). A gopa ( under the nāgaraka ) was to superin tend a group of twenty or forty families in the capital and an officer designated sthānika was to be in charge of each of four wards into which the capital was to be divided. Yāj. II. 173 mentions an officer called sthānapāla in connection with the 

finding of lost goods who appears to be the same as sthānika. The gopa and sthānika had to keep a register of the caste, gotra,

name and occupation of the men and women in their districts and also of their income and expenditure. Managers of charitable institutions had to send information to them about the heretics and travellers arriving to reside therein. Numerous rules about reporting and punishments for various defaults and wrongs are laid down, which are passed over. Manu VII. 121 and Santi 87. 10 also provide for the appointment in each city ( in the kingdom) of a high officer, who was to superintend all matters affecting the city and who had ample powers of restraint and coercion. Many of the superintendents mentioned by Kautilya occur under the same names in the Kāmasūtra e.g. gavādhyakşa, sūtrādhyaksa, nāgaraka (explained by the com. as dandapāśika ), paņyādhyaksa ( in V, 5. 7-10). Vide E. I. vol. 15 pp, 127-128 for a statement on the provincial adminis tration under the Guptas. 

As regards the emoluments of the officers in charge of a village, ten villages &c. Manu ( VII. 118-119 ) has some interes ting rules: The headman of a village should obtain (as his emoluments ) those articles which the villagers have to furnish every day to the king viz. food, drink, fuel and the like. The officer over ten villages should enjoy one kula 189, that over twenty villages should enjoy five kulas, the superintendent of a hundred villages should receive the revenue of one village and the high officer over a thousand villages should enjoy (the revenue of ) a town. All this, as Medhātithi says, is only approxi mate and recommendatory and was not literally followed, but 

188. The word 'pratyaham'( every day) excludes taxes on fields that are levied once a year or taxes levied on particular occasions only; while the words food, drink and fuel' exclude cattle, money &c. The word 

kula' appears to be used as a technical term. It may mean as much land as would be required for the maintenance of a family. But there is another sense given by the commentators of Manu. Sarvajña-Nārāyana quotes a text that kula means' two halas'. He and Kullūka quote Hārita to the effect that a plough (yoked acc. to dharma ) is one of eight bullocks, one of six bullocks is employed by those who want only bare maintenance, householders employ one of four bullocks, while those who in their greed want to incur heavy sin employ a plough with two bulls only. So by kula is meant as much land as can be ploughed with two ploughs to which either 8, 6 or 4 bullocks are yoked. That 6 or 8 or 12 oxen were yoked to the plough is stated in Atharva VI. 91.1 and Tai. S. V. 2. 5. 2.

only means that a salary commensurate with the position and responsibilities of each officer should be received by him. Vide Sānti 87. 6-8 for rules similar to Manu's (where the officer over a thousand villages gets as his salary the revenues of a sākhānagara). Kautilya ( in V.3) sets out the salaries of many officers and servants as follows: the salary paid to the chief mantrin, purohita and a few others has been already stated above (p. 120); the dauvārika, the superintendent of the harem ( antar vamsika), the praśāsts, the samāhartr and the sannidhātņ were to receive 24000 panas; the princes (other than the crown prince), the nurse (māts, mother?) of the princes, nāyaka, the superinten dent in charge of justice (or commercial transactions ?) in the capital (the pauravyāvahārika ), the superintendent of royal manufactories (karmantika ), the members of the council of ministers, the rāştrapāla ( governor of a province), antapāla ( the guardian of the borders ) were to receive 12000 panas; the salary of the heads of śrenis ( the military corporations ?), the heads of the elephant army, cavalry, and chariot army, and the pradestrs was 8000 panas; the superintendents (below the commanders ) of infantry, cavalry, chariots and elephants, of the forest produce and elephant forests will each receive 4000; the chariot driver (anika), the army physician, the trainer of horses, carpenters, yoniposaka (?) will receive 2000; the foreteller (the reader of omens), astrologer ( who finds auspicious times for undertakings ), the reader of purānas, the sūta, māgadha ( bard), the assistants (puruşa) of the purohita and adhyakşas will receive 1000; trained foot-soldiers, the accountants and scribes will receive 500; musicians 250, but trumpet-blowers will receive 500; artisans ( kāru ) and craftsmen ( šilpin ) 120; servants in charge of bipeds and quadrupeds, workers doing miscellaneous things, attendants near the king, bodyguard and the officer procuring free labour (visti ) will receive 60; those appointed to do piece work (kāryayukta, v. 1. āryayukta ), the elephant driver, boys (mānavaka, a page?), mountain-diggers, all atten dants, teachers and learned men shall receive honorarium (pājā vetana) according to their merit from 500 to 1000; charioteer of the king 1000 ; spies of the five sorts ( vide above p. 129 ) will receive 1000; the village servants (like washer-man), the spies of the type of sattrin, desperado, poisoner and ascetic women will receive 500; the wandering spies (vide above p. 130) three hundred or more according to the labour involved. The superintendents in charge of a group of hundred or a thousand ( servants) were to regulate the subsistence (bhakta ), cash salary, the perquisites,152

the appointment and transfer of those under them. But there shall be no transfer of those who are the king's personal servants and of those who are appointed to guard forts and the country parts. The Sukranitisāra (I. 211) emphasizes that salaries should be in paņas, that a king should not make a gift even of a finger-breadth of land as emolument to any servant, but that if he does give land, it should be held only for the life-time of the officer 189. Kautilya ( in II. 1) prescribes that lands may be granted as emoluments to superintendents (of the various depart ments ), the accountants, to officers called gopa and sthānika, to officers in the army, physicians, horse-trainers, but without power to sell or mortgage. Sukra II. 117–204 mentions numerous officers of the army, the treasury &c. Sukra IV. 7. 24-27 sets out the salaries of officers, when the king's income is one lakh of mudrās a year. Kaut. provides for pensions and gratuities. He says' the song and wives of those that die while on duty whall get subsistence and wages. Young children, aged persons and ailing persons related to the ( dying ) officers shall be shown favour. On occasions of funerals, sickness or child birth the king shall bestow money and honours on them'. The Mahābhārata (Sabha. 5.54 ) prescribes 190 that it is the duty of the king to support the wives of those that meet death or calamities in the king's service. Sukra II. 406-411 contains very modern-looking rules about sick-leave, casual leave, pension after 40 years of service &c. 

The above provisions from Kautilya's work show how States in ancient India engaged in almost all the activities of modern States, had an equally complicated machinery of administration and an army of high and low officers. It will also be noticed how, as in India at present, comparatively very high salaries were paid to ministers and heads of departments as compared with the salaries of clerks (e. g. the ordinary clerks received five hundred, while the chief minister and samāharts, the

If all the different officers mentioned in the works on dharmaśāstra, arthaśāstra and in inscriptions be collected together, they will make a formidably long list. A list from one inscription is set out below as a sample. 191 Vide Vogel's ' Inscriptions from Chamba' pp. 120-136 for explanations of about 30 titles of officers occurring in the inscriptions. 

A few words must be said about local administration. The word grāma occurs even in the Rgveda, In Rg. I. 114, 1 the poet offers his praise and prayer to Rudra so that he hopes that 'all bipeds and quadrupeds may fare well and all beings in this village may be free from disease and may enjoy prosperity :: 198 In Rg. V, 54.8 'heroes (or men) conquering grāmas' are mentioned ( grāmajito yathā narah). In Rg. X. 62. 11 Manu is styled 'grāmapi' and the bestower of a thousand (cows ?) and in Rg. X. 107.5 it is said that the 'grāmani who is endowed with (or dispenses ) dakşiņā ( cows or wealth) walks in front ( of the village people )'. In the Tai. $. II. 5.4.4 it is said the prosperous are three indeed, viz. the learned brāhmaṇa, the village headman (grāmaņi) and the rājanya ( warrior)'. 19 In the Tai. Br. I. 1.4.8, the consecration of fire for a vaibya sacrificer is made with the mantra 'manostvā grāmanyo vratapate vratenādadhāmi' (where Manu is styled grāmaņi). In the Sat. Br. V. 4. 4. 19 the grāmaņi is said to be stronger than his co-sharer (sajāta). Vide S. B. E. vol. 41 p. 111. We saw above

(p. 111 ) that among the ratnins, grāmanı (the village headman) was one. Grāma did not necessarily mean a village but may have been applied to a town ( though not a capital). The head man of a village was called grāmani, grāmika or grāmadhipati (in Manu VII. 115-116, Kaut. III. 10 ), grāmakūta ( in inscrip tions e. g. E. I vol. VII. p. 39 of sake 852, E. I. vol. VII. p. 183, 188 ) and Pattakila, modern Patil (in Ujjain plates of 975 and 1023 A, D. in I. A, vol. 6 p. 51, 53, vol. 18 p. 322 grant of Bhoja in samvat 1076, 1. A. 16 p. 254, E. I. vol. XI. p. 304, 310 of sainvat 1176 ). In an inscription of the 13th century from the Poona District we have the form pattela' (E. I. vol. VII. at p. 183 ). The word 'gāvunda' for a village headman in the Canarese Districts is derived from grāmakūta ( E, I. vol. VII p. 183). Paithinasi 193 quoted by Aparārka p. 239 states that the food of a grāmakūta could not be partaken by a brāhmana, The Gathāgaptaśati frequently refers to the great influence of the grāmani and the love adventures of his son in the village (1 30-31, VII. 24). The Kāmasūtra states (V. 5.5 ) that the young son of a grāmādhipati had certain women of the village at his beck and call. 194 According to the Sukranitisāra I. 193 a grāma (village ) is one krośa in extent and yields a revenue of one thousand silver karşas, while half a village is called palli and half of palli was kumbha. Hemādri in Dānakhanda (p. 288 ) quotes from the Mārkandeya-purāna definitions of pura, kheta, kharvata and grāma. Yāj. II. 167 makes a distinc tion between grāma, kharvata and nagara (town) as regards the extent of the pasture lands to be preserved round them. Baudhāyana Dh. S. II. 3. 58 and 60 condemns residence in a city for a religious brāhmana where the body is covered with dust which enters one's mouth and eyes and recommends for residence a grāma abounding in water, fuel, fodder, fuel-sticks, kusa grass, flowers, which is full of well-to-do people, endowed with industrious people, where the majority are āryas and which cannot be entered by robbers. In the Sabhāparva 5,84 five officers of a village are referred to. It appears that from being a very high officer (a ratnin) in Vedic times the grāmani was reduced in his influence, came to be appointed by the king alone and the office became hereditary and could be given permanently.

Local administration 

155 

E.I. vol. VII. p. 177, 188, 189 195. The Sukranitisāra (II. 120-21 ) states that there were to be six officers in a village and (II. 428-29) prescribes their caste, viz. sāhasādhipati (i.e. a magistrate to deal with wrongs involving force) was to be a ksatriya, grāmanetr (the headman) a brahmana, bhāgahāra (the person collecting the state land revenue) a ksatriya, lekhaka (a scribe, corresponding to the modern kulkarni in the Deccan ) should be a kāyastha, sulkagrāha (the toll-gate keeper) a vaisya, pratihāra (the guard at the gate of the village wall ) a sūdra. Sukra ( in II. 170-175 ) sets out their duties. The headman was to be alert in protecting the villagers like their parents from thieves, robbers and from the State officers, the bhāgahāra was to devote special care to the tending of trees; the lekhaka was to be skilled in accounting and proficient in several spoken languages; the pratihāra was to be of strong body, proficient in arms, humble and to call the villagers with the respect due to each; and the toll-gate keeper was to levy tolls in such a way that sellers did not incur loss of capital spent by them. From Kaut. III. 10 it appears that the village headman had the authority to inflict fines in certain cases e. g. when the headman (grāmika ) had to travel on some business of the whole village the villagers were to accompany him by turns, but if they failed to do so they had to pay a fine of one pana or a half paņa. Similarly, if a villager does not co-operate in the getting up of a show (prekşā) in the village, he or his people would not be allowed to gee the show and he was to be fined if he clandestinely saw it. In villages, particularly in Karnataka and South India and in brahmadeya grants ( to learned brāhmaṇas ) the village assemblies (sabha ) carried on local administration. From the Kotavumachgi Inscription of Cālukya Vikramāditya V dated sake 934 ( 1012 A, D.) it appears that Ummachige was a great educational centre in the 11th century and 104 Mahājanas of the village were entrusted with the proper conduct of worship in the temple, the imparting of education, the feeding of ascetics, the supply of water to the village and the punishment of criminals (E. I. vol. 20.p. 59). Vide Gopalan's 'History of the Pallavas of Kāñol' pp. 93, 158-157 for the working of the village assemblies (sabhās ) from the 9th century onwards, but as he observes (p. 154 ),'we do not know the nature of the rules that regulated their working, their exact sphere of action and their

relation to the central government.' An inscription of king Parantaka I (907-947 A, D.) at Uttaramerur deals with several classes of village committees that were appointed by vote ( Annual Report of Archæological Survey of India, 1904-5 pp. 131 ff). Five committees, viz. annual comınittee, garden committee, tank committee, gold committee (for currency or for collecting taxes in cash), pañcavāra committee, are des cribed and reference is made to a sixth called 'justice committee and the mode of election and the qualifications and disquali fications of members are described in detail (pp. 142-145 ). Prof. Nilkanth Sastri in 'Studies in Cola History' (pp. 131-175) publishes the text of two Parāntaka Inscriptions with English translation and exhaustive notes. Vide also E. I. vol. 22 p. 5 for resolutions of the sabhā at Manur to be followed in future meetings, the qualifications in property, education and character of the members &c., E. I. vol. 24 p. 28 about the regulations of sabhā from two Uttaramallur Inscriptions and E. I. vol. 23 p. 22 for a note on the pañcavāra committee. For village communities as described in Buddhist works in the 7th century B.O., vide Rhys Davids in 'Buddhist India' pp. 45–51. It appears from Pāṇini and the commentary Kāśikā thereon that certain craftsmen were attached hereditarily to the village, were probab ly paid a certain part of the crop produce yearly for their services and corresponded to the modern village servants (call ed the twelve bulutedūrs ) in the Deccan. For an account of these balutedūrs, vide Grant Duff's History of the Marathas' (Bombay ed. Of 1863, vol. I. pp. 23-27). For example, Pāṇini (VI. 2. 62 ) teaches the accent of a compound word formed from 'grāma' with another word denoting 'silpin' (craftsman), such as grāmanāpita (village barber) or grāmakulāla ( village potter ), which are two examples given by the Kašik, on this sūtra. From Pāṇini V. 4.95 ('grāmakauţābhyam ca takşpah') it may be inferred that a carpenter also was a village servant as in modern times in the Deccan. Bphaspati 196 contains very

important information about local administration in villages. A compact formed among villages, guilds and corporations (gana ) is called a samaya ( agreement);such an agreement must be observed in times of distress and for acts of dharma. Two, three or five persons shall be appointed as advisers of groups ; their advice shall be followed by the villagers, the guilds, the corporations and others. Examples of agreement as to times of distress are: When there is drought, there may be a compact that for the performance of a sacrifice to the planets or the like each field or house should contribute so much money or when there is trouble from robbers, each house should send one able-bodied and armed man. Then examples are given by Bphaspati himself about acts of dharma. The village people should put down in writing what work they are going to do, such as the repair of a house for their assembly, a shed for distributing water to travellers, a temple, a tank or a garden, the performance of the necessary saṁskāras ( upanayana or funeral rites ) of the poor and helpless, gifts for the performance of sacrifices, prevention of famine-stricken groups of families from coming. Such conyen tions would be proper and should be respected by all the villagers. Whoever being able to carry out such agreements violates them should be punished with loss of all wealth and banishment. Bphaspati further says 17 that the heads of families, guilds and ganas and the inhabitants of towns and forts may pronounce the two punishments of reprimand and condemnation against wrong-doers and may also excommunicate them and the punish ments and favours declared by them according to rules should be approved of by the king, since such power is regarded by the sages as delegated to them. For ejecting out of the village one who is not guilty of theft or adultery with another's wife the village headman or the village was liable to pay, according to Kautilya III. 10, a fine of 24 paņas. It will be seen from what has preceded that village administration was self-contained and would function whatever Government might happen to be at the centre. The central Government did not very much interfere with local administration, except in the matter of land revenue, protection against invasion and exercised only general control and supervision. The village communities were miniature states.

History of Dharmaśāstra 

(Voi. 

There was a great deal of decentralization or devolution of authority from the central government to the village committees and authorities. They were also entrusted with civil and criminal justice, as we shall see later on. For further details on the organization of a village as a political unit, Dr. R. C. Majmudar's 'Corporate life in Ancient India'chap. II. pp. 135 ff. and Fick (p. 161) may be consulted. Just as there was some organization in villages in general, so also guilds ( śrepis ) and groups ( ganas ) had their own regulations and conventions. In XI. 1 Kautilya refers to ksatriya guilds in the countries of Kambhoja and Suraştra that maintained themselves on husbandry and followed the profession of arms ( vide above p. 88 n. 120 ). In III. 14 he refers to guilds of workmen or labourers ( sangha bhrtāh). Manu (I. 118) declares that his work deals not only with the enduring dharm is of countries, castes and families, but also with the dharmas of heretical sects (pāşanda) and of groups (gaña). Manu (VIII. 41 ) requires the righteous king to consider carefully the dharmas of castes, countries, guilds and families ( to find out whether they are opposed to the Vedas ) and uphold those dharmas ( that are not opposed ) as binding (on those respective persons). Yāj. II. 192 prescribes that the king should respect the usages and conventions of occupational guilds, merchants, heretical sects, and groups (corporations &c.) and allow them to pursue the course of action they had followed from ancient times. Narada ( samayasyānapa karma, verses 2-6) and Bphaspati quoted in the Viramitrodaya ( vyavahāra ) contain very important directions as to what conventions of guilds the king should respect and what he is not bound to respect. Nārada says that the king should enforce the conventions agreed upon by heretic sects, naigamas (merchants), śrenis and other groups residing in the country or the capital. The king may allow them to follow their special rules (e. g. speaking the truth ), their special actions ( begging in the morn ing without having taken a bath ), their mode of meeting (on hearing a drum being beaten), the means of livelihood they have been used to (e. g. dressing as an ascetic). But the king should prohibit (out of their usages and conventions) such as are opposed to the king's interest, or are disapproved of by the people in general, would be ruinous to the purposes of the king. The king should not tolerate their creating factious groups among themselves, taking up arms for a purpose detrimental to the State, and causing injury to each other. The king should specially curb those who cause dissensions among the several

groups ; if they are connived at in these activities they might cause terrible danger. 198 A good deal has already been said about guilds and corporations in H. Dh, vol. II. pp. 66-69. Among inscriptions, the following may be studied : the Nasik Ins. No. 15 of the time of Abhira Išvarasena (E. I. vol. VIII p. 88, where the śrenis of potters, oil-pressers and water-drawers receive deposits), Junnar Buddhist cave Inscription (A, S. W. I. vol. 4 p. 97, where a deposit of money with śrenis of bamboo-workers and braziers is made), Gupta Inscription No. 16 p.70(an endowment was entrusted to the guild of oil-men, whose head was Jivanta), Gupta Inscript ions, No. 18 p.79 (silk weavers from Lāta coming to Dasapura and building a Sun temple ), E. I. vol. 15 p. 263, E. I. vol. 18 p. 326 and p. 30, E. I. 16 p. 332, E. I. vol. I. 155 ( of 933 saivat, inscrip tion at Gopagiri, modern Gwalior, where the guilds of oil-millers and of gardeners are mentioned), I. 184 (Pehoa inscription, where a guild of 34 horse-dealers from different countries, some being brāhmaṇas, agreed to impose upon themselves and their customers tithes to be distributed to certain temples ). Rhys Davids in 'Buddhist India '(pp. 90-96 ) gives a list of the 18 guilds that probably existed in the times of the early Buddhist works (though two or three of them are of doubtful existence) and the number of which ( 18 ) is sometimes mentioned in the Jātakas (as in Mūgapakkhajātaka No. 538, vol. VI p. 14 in Cowell's tr.). For further details about the working and organization of guilds, vide chap. I of Dr. R. C. Majmudar's 

Corporate life in ancient India', and ' Indian Culture' vol. 6 (for 1940 ) pp. 421-28 (on the economic guilds of blacksmiths, barbers &b. in the Kuşāņa period). 

In numerous places rules are laid down about the qualifica tions of the ordinary servants ( parivāra, bhrtya or anujivin) of kings, how they should conduct themselves, how servants should

find out whether the king is pleased or displeased with them. Vide Kautilya V. 4, Virātaparva 4, 12-50 ( where the refrain of most verses is 'sa rajavasatim vaset'), Matsyapurāņa 216 (the whole of which is quoted in the Rajadharmakāpda pp. 24-27 and in the Rājanitiprakāśa pp. 189-192), Agni purāņa 221, Vispudharmottara II. 25. 2-28, Kām. IV. 10-11, V. 1-4, 6, 9, 11-63 ( most of which are quoted in the Rājanitirat nākara pp. 51-58), Sukranitisāra II. 54-68, 205-253. On the word' akşudraparişad ' occurring in Yāj. I. 310 ( where the Mit. has the reading 'akşudrosparusaḥ') Visvarūpa quotes a passage from Sankha 199'a haisa (gwan i, e a good king ) surrounded by vultures (greedy servants) is not desirable, but a vulture ( i.e. a greedy king ) surrounded by hamsas ( servants of spotless character) may be preferred.' The Rājanitiprakāśa (p. 185 ) quotes the same passage from Sankha-Likhita with an addition viz. faults arise from those who surround the king and such faults are enough to ruin (the king). Therefore the (king) should first before engaging his servants) put down in writing whether servants are endowed with learning, character and good family.' Sukra inculcates loyalty on servants in the following remarkable 200 words 'one should not forsake a good master when he is in adversity. Should not one always and quickly desire the welfare of one's protector whose salt (lit. food) one has eaten with honour even once' (II. 246-247)? This senti ment pervaded most Hindu servants in ancient and medieval times, even under foreign rulers professing a different religion. The Rājanitiprakāśa p. 176 quotes a fine verse from the Garuda purāņa as to matters to be principally considered in selecting servants, which are four, vis education, character, family and

actions, just as gold is tested in four ways, viz. by weighing it or by rubbing it (on a touchstone), by cutting it and by heating it.&01 

Some responsibilities of the Government or king in ancient India towards the people will now be dealt with. From Kautilya (II. 29 and II, 34 ) we find that the State made great efforts for the rearing of cattle, made stringent rules for their protection and for the provision of pastures. Manu VIII. 237, Yāj. 11. 167, Matsya 227. 24 also make provision for pastures round villages, towns and cities. Kautilya requires the superintendent of cattle to classify cattle as calves, steers, tameables, draught oxen, bulls to be yoked, stud-bulls, bulls meant for carts, cattle meant for meat and buffaloes meant for carrying loads or for being yoked, pregnant cows, milch cattle &c. and to mark them and note in a register of beasts the branded marks, natural marks, colour, the distance between the horns. He prescribes corporal punishments and fine for those who unauthorizedly kill or steal cattle or incite others to do so. He prescribes even the amount of fodder, oil cakes, bran and salt on which different kinds of animals put to different kinds of work are to be fed. From the Mahābhārata also we learn that even princes 80l« went to supervise and enumerate the herds of cattle belonging to the State, Vide Vanaparva 239. 4 and 240. 4-6. Even such a grammatical work as the Mahābhāgya incidentally gives expression to the view that a country's wealth consists in its food-crops and in abundance of cattle. 

We saw above (pp. 130-131) that spies were to be employed (acc. to Kāut.) to test whether State officers took bribes. Yaj. (1. 336, 338, 339 ) prescribes that the king should protect his subjects from the harassment caused by küyjasthas (the account. ants and scribes), that he should ascertain the doings of the State officers through spies, honour those that are well-conducted and severely punish those who are badly behaved and should deprive those who take bribes of their wealth and banish them from the country. Vide also Manu VII. 122-124 and Visnudharmottara for similar rules. The Pancatantra (I. 343) has the same verse as

Yaj. I. 336 ( except the last pada ). Medhātithi on Manu IX. 294 remarks that the kingdom has no fear of ruin if kantakas (wicked people who are like thorns) are removed and justice is properly administered and that kantakas are generally under the protection of the queen, the prince, the king's favourites or the commander-in-chief. 

Great attention was paid to agriculture. In the Sabhāparva 5.77 the king 80% is advised to have large tanks in different parts of the country full of water and to see that agriculture did not depend on the rains alone. Megasthenes (Fragment I. p. 30 of McCrindle's work ) notes that the greater part of the soil of India was in his day under irrigation and consequently bore two crops in the year. Even from the Tai. S. V. 1, 7. 3 it. appears that two crops were grown in the year ( tasmad dvih samvatsarasya sasyam pacyate ). The Vāj. S. 18. 12 contains a list of twelve different kinds of crops such as rice, yava, wheat, mūşa, sesame, mudga, masūra &c, and the Bṛ. Up. VI. 3. 13 enumerates ton kinds of grain ( grāmyāņi dhānyāni). In the Hathigumphā Inscription of Khāravela king of Kalinga (E. I. vol. 20 p. 71 ) it is stated that (p. 79 ) a canal which had already been opened in the 103rd year of the Nanda kings (i. e. in the 4th century B. C.) was extended by him in the 5th year of his reign. Rudradaman at great expense from his own treasury without any additional taxation or demand for free labour restored the famous Sudarsana lake near Junāgad (E. I. vol. VIII. p. 36 ) that had been built by the Governors of Candragupta and Asoka and been breached by floods. Irrigation had been made uge of from Vedic times. Rg. VII. 49.2 refers to rivers and springs naturally flowing and to channels that were dug up, South Indian Inscriptions show how the Pallavas and kings of other dynasties built tanks which were named after the kings themselves or after some distinguished chief of the locality and that are in existence even now. Vide S. I I. Vol. II part III, p. 351, E. I. vol. IV p. 152 (mention of tank called 'parame śvaratatāka'), 8. I. 1 vol. I p. 150, E. I. vol. VIII p. 145 ( for mention of rājatatāka near which four nivartanas were granted by Cārudevi). The great engineer Suyya under Avantivarman of Kashmir ( 833-858 ) successfully dammed the river Vitastā with the result that a khari of rice which could formerly be purchased for 200 dināras could be had after the great irrigation

work for 36 dināras (vide Rājatarangiņi V. 84-117). Kautilya (II. 24 ) refers to the various ways in which crops could be rais ed with water and the revenue to be demanded in each case, e. g. those who watered crops with manual labour had to pay 1/5th of the produce, those who carried water on their shoulders paid Ith, those who watered their crops by means of water-lifts or water-wheels from natural springs paid one-third and those who raised water from rivers, lakes, tanks and wells paid Ith. He notes that sugarcane crops are a heavy responsibility, as they are liable to many evils and entail great expense. Sugarcane had been grown even in the times of the Atharvaveda (I. 34. 5). The Sukranitisāra (IV. 4.60 ) remarks that the king should see to it that there is plenty of water in his kingdom by digging wells, wells with steps, tanks, lakes &c. Megasthenes (fragment XXXIV p. 86 of McCrindle's ' Ancient India ') says that some superintend the rivers, measure the land as is done in Egypt and inspect the sluices by which water is let out from the main canals into their branches so that every one may have an equal share of it. Kaut. (IV.3) devotes a special chapter to the king's duty to save the kingdom from national calamities, viz. fires, floods, diseases, famines, rats, wild elephants (or beasts ), snakes and evil spirits. He gives practical hints for human and religious remedies and rites against these calamities. The measures against famine suggested by him are: the king may 

provide the people with seeds and food, start works for those who are distressed, distribute either his own collection of provis ions or that of the rich or call for help from his allies, tax the rich and make them disgorge their wealth, migrate to other countries that have abundant harvests. National calamities are called iti, which are six: excessive rainfall, drought, rats, locusts, parrots and too close presence of foreign kings 803. The work of Kāmandaka states that calamities are either divine or human and that the first are of five kinds. In another place he gives & longer list of calamities. There are several references in ancient and medieval works to severe famines. In the Chāndogya Upanişad I. 10. 1-3 we

have the story of Uşasti Cakrāyana who took from another's plate kulmāşas that the other had been eating (i. e, he took ucchista food), when the country of Kurus was overwhelmed with a shower of hail (or by locusts ). The Bālakāņda (chap. 9) refers to a famine in the country of Anga under Romapada. The Nirukta II. 10 refers to a drought in the dim past for twelve years in the kingdom of Santanu. A Mauryan inscription from Mahāsthāna (ancient Pundranagara) shows that Gapdaka coins were distributed and also corn to famine-stricken people (J. A. S. B. for 1932 p. 123). The Sohagpur Copperplate Inscription (of Mauryan times) contains an order of the mahāmātras of Srāvasti that the dravya storehouses were to be spent only in case of drought. Vide Annals of B. O. R. Institute, vol. XI p. 32ff., E. I vol. 2% p. 1 and J. A.S. B. vol. VII (for 1941) part 2 p. 203. The Rājatarangiņi records several times the occurrence of famines in Kashmir at different periods (e. g. vide II. 17-54, V. 270-278, VII. 1219 ff). The Manimekhalai (chap. 28) speaks of a famine for twelve years at Kañol in South India. There was a terrible famine (called the famine of Durgādeyi) for twelve years in the Deccan about 1396 A. D. ( vide Grant Duff's "History of the Marāthas' vol. I. p. 43). Vide E. I. vol. 15 p. 12 for a reference to a severe famine in sake 1313 when paddy could not be had even at the rate of ten nāļis a pananı. 

It has been shown ( in H. Dh. vol. II. pp. 113, 369, 856-858) how it was the king's duty to support learned brāhmaṇas, to hold assemblies of poets and learned men, to make gifts of land to educational institutions and to promote learning in all ways. Vṛddha-Hārita VII. 229-230 says that only learned brāhmaṇas who are endowed with tapas are proper objects of the king's bounty. Some emperors like Harşa went far beyond what was reasonable. The Chinese pilgrim tells us ( Beal's 'Buddhist Records &c.' vol. I pp. 214, 233 ) that at the end of every five years Harsa held an assembly (parişad ) at Prayāga and gave away all in charity. The Sukranitisāra ( I. 368-369 ) holds that a king should be on the look-out for educated men, should appoint them to offices suited to their education, should honour every year those who have attained eminence in learning and the arts and take measures for the advancement of learning and arts. It has already been shown how this had been followed by ancient and medieval Indian kings to the letter. A comparison with the British Indian Government in the 18th century and the first decades of the 19th will be highly interesting. After the battle of

Er Expense on education under British rule 

165 

Plassey in 1757 the British East India Company got three such rich provinces as Bengal, Bihar and Orissa. During over 50 years the only thing that was done by the ruling power for the encouragement of learning among Indians was that in 1780 Warren Hastings started a Madrassa of Muslim religious learn ing at Calcutta with a moulvi and 40 stipendiaries and Lord Cornwallis founded a Sanskrit college at Benares in 1792. When the East India Company's Charter was renewed in 1813 the only provision that was made for education and encouragement of learning (by George III, 1813 chap. 155, clause 43 ) was ' that it shall and may be lawful for the Governor General-in-Council to direct that out of any surplus which may remain of the rents, revenues and profits arising from the said territorial acquisitions, after defraying the expenses of the military, civil and commercial establishments and paying the interest of the debt, a sum of not less than one lakh of rupees in each year shall be set apart and applied to the revival and improvement of literature and the encouragement of the learned natives of India and for the introduction and promotion of a knowledge of the sciences among the inhabitants of the British territories in India'. Detailed comment is not called for. More than 50 years after British rule began, when at least half of what is British India now had come into the hands of the British, and when the yearly income must have been many crores of rupees, the sum of u lalch of rupees was to be set apart for educa tion of two kinds (Eastern and Western) in the whole of the then British India. Further this provision was not compulsory but only permissive, and was to be availed of only if some surplus was left after everything else had been provided for. 

As in western Jurisprudence, so in India the king was looked upon as parens patriæ, the protector or guardian of all minors. Gaut.206 X. 48-49 and Manu VIII. 27 prescribe that the king shall protect the property of a minor until he attains majority or until he returns from his teacher's house. Medhātithi on Manu VIIL 27 says that the minor's relatives like the uncles may contend that one of them is the guardian of the minor's property but it is the king who is to see that the minor's property is kept

safe. Baud. Dh. S. II. 2. 43, Vas. 16. 8-9, Vişnu Dh. 8. III. 65, Saökha-Likhita contain a similar rule. Nār. (rpādāpa 35) declared that a person was a minor till the 16th year. Manu VIII, 28–29, Vispudharmagūtra II. 65 extend the same rule and say that the king must take care of barren women, women who have no sons, women whose families are extinct, wives and widows who are faithful to their husbands and of those who are afflicted with disease. Nār. 80s as quoted by Medhātithi says that if a woman has nobody in her husband's or father's family to protect her, then it is the king who is to protect her. Kaut 206 (II. 1) makes it a duty of the elders of the village to take care of and increase the properties of minors and of temples. 

It was the special concern of the king to see that proper weights and measures were used. Kaut. (II. 19) as stated above (pp.145-146) provides for a special superintendent of weights and measures. Vas.207 ( 19. 13 ) and Manu VIII. 403 provide that all weights and measures must be duly marked (or stamped), that once in six months they must be re-examined and that the weights and measures for objects required by the class of householders must be guarded against falsifications. Yāj. II. 240 and Vişpudharmasutra V. 122 prescribe as punishment the highest ammercement for those who fabricate false balances, edicts, measures and coins and also for those who use them in their transactions. The Nitivākyāmrta (p. 98 ) requires the king to be vigilant as regards merchandise, balances and measures, since there is none who excels traders in stealing people's money before their very eyes. 208 Vide Alberuni (tr, by Sachau) vol. I chap. XV about weights and measures current in India in the 11th century. 

Another important responsibility of the king concerned thefts. Ašvapati, king of Kekaya, boasted that in his kingdom there was no thief, no close-fisted person, no drinker of wine,

(Chan, Up. V. 11.5). Ap. Dh. S. 899 (II. 10. 26. 6-8) lays down that the officers should protect a city against theft for one yojana round it and in the case of villages for one kroša round them and that whatever is stolen within those limits must be returned to the owners by the officers. Gautama X. 46-47, Manu VIII. 40, Yāj. II. 36, Visņudharmasūtra III. 66-67, Sānti 75. 10 prescribe that the king should recover from the thief stolen property and restore it to the owner ( without distinction of caste ), that if he cannot restore it he should compensate the sufferer from his own treasury, and that, if he retained the property recovered from a thief or did not make efforts to catch the thief and compensate the owner, the king incurred sin. Kaut III. 16 contains a similar rule.210 Visvarūpa on Yāj. II. 38 quotes a prose passage 211 of Br. with a similar import. The Vişnudharmottara €12 ( II. 61. 52 ) remarks that if a person is robbed by his own servants then he (the king ) may endeavour to recover it from the servants (by threatening or beating them), but need not restore it from his own treasury. Yāj II. 270-272, Nār. (parišişta 16-21 ) and Kāt. 13 give further directions, viz. the thief should be made to restore the property stolen or its price; if the thief cannot be found the officers and wardens of the country pay the price of the stolen articles; the property stolen in the village should be made good by the headman of the village, if the thief's foot-steps

are not traced as going out of the village ; if the theft takes place in a pasture land or forest (and the thief is not found), the owner of it should be made to pay; if however the theft is not committed in a forest but on the road then the officers appointed to arrest thieves should be made to pay; the whole village may be made to pay the compensation when the theft is within the boundaries of a village but outside the limit of the residential quarters, if the footsteps of the thief are not traced as going out of the village ; if the theft takes place beyond one krośa from a village then the surrounding five or ten villages may be made to pay the compensation. Yāj. II. 271 and Kāt. mention an officer called 'cauroddhartā' ('or coroddharta'). The * cauroddharanika'(thief-catcher) is an officer mentioned in numerous inscriptions e. g. in the Palitana plates of Dharasena II of Valabhi in Gupta year 252 (E. I. vol. XI at p. 83 ), in the inscription of Nārāyanapāla where we have both cauroddharanika and kottapāla, modern Kotwal (I. A. vol. XV p. 304) and in the grant of Ballālasena quoted above (p. 153, n. 191). Kautilya IV. 13 also gives similar rules and mentions an officer called *corarajjuka' who has to make good the loss of merchandise by theft between two villages or lands that are not pasture lands. 

The first quality required in a king according to Yāj. I. 309 quoted above (p. 44) is great energy and Kaug. also (in VI. 1) ment ions 'great energy' (mahotsāha) among the qualities called 'ābhi gāmika'. Works on dharmaśāstra and arthaśāstra emphasize the fact that a king must always be full of activity and must not be lethargic or fatalistic. In the Mahābhārata the topic of human effort and daiva (fate or destiny) comes up for treatment in numerous places and is put in the mouth of several characters with different emphasis according to circumstances. In Adi 1. 246-247, 89.7-10, Sabhā 46. 16, 47. 36, 58. 14, Vanaparva 179. 27-28, Udyoga 8. 52, 40. 32, 159. 4, 186. 18, Aśramavāsika 10. 29 the emphasis is on daiva as all powerful, it being said that human effort is useless as against daiva. A golden mean is advocated in Adi. 123. 21, Sabha 16. 12, Udyoga 79, 5-6, Santi 56. 14-15, Sauptika 2. 3, in all of which it is said that worldly affairs require both purusakāra (effort) and daiva. In certain other passages it is recommended that effort is superior to daiva and that one's business is to make efforts and not to care for fate; e.g. in Drona 152, 27, Santi 27. 32, 58. 13-16, 163. 50, Anušāsana 6.1 ff, Sauptika 2. 12-13 and 23-24. A few of the striking passages indicative of the three lines of thought are

set out in the note below. $14 Energetic action, according to Santi. 58. 13-15, is declared by Brhaspati to be the root of rājadharma. Nectar was obtained and asuras were killed by the gods by means of energetic action and Indra secured his high position in heaven and here by energetic action. Br. makes the characteristic remark 'A man who is a hero of action leads those who are heroes in speech and the latter are seen to cater for the pleasures of the former and wait humbly on him'. The Bhagavadgita in its final summing up of the philosophy of Activism without an eye to the fruit of it but from a sense of duty declares (XVIII. 13-16 ) ' that in the Sankhya philosophy five categories are mentioned as conducive to the accomplishment of all actions viz. the place, the agent, various kinds of instruments, diverse and separate activities and lastly daiva; that whatever action a man commences either with his body, words or mind these five are its causes, whether the action be righteous ( nyāyya ) or the opposite of it, and that this being the true state of things (i, e, the fruit depending on the co-operation of five elements and not on one alone ) that man who regards himself alone as bringing about a result is a fool and has no correct perception.' Kautilya also (I. 19 last two verses ) says' activity (utthāna) is the root of wealth and the opposite of it is the root of evil. In the absence of activity the loss of present and future acquisitions is sure; by activity a king can obtain his desired object and plenty of wealth'. Yāj. ( 1. 349 and 351 ) states that success in undertakings depends upon both fate and human effort, yet fate is nothing but the

human effort of past lives manifesting its effect ( in this life) and that as on a single wheel a chariot cannot progress, so fate cannot accomplish anything without human effort. Yāj. I. 350 refers to other views viz. fate alone leads to success, human effort alone does so, that success results of itself (without any cause ), while others say that it is Time that brings about all results. Manu VII. 205, Matsya 221, 1-12 (all of which are quoted in the Rājanītiprakāśa pp. 313-314) and Vişnudharmottara II. 66 ( which has the same verses as in Matsya 221 ) inculcate the same doctrine as that of Yāj. I. 349 and 351 and emphasize that one must always make efforts (tasmāt sadotthānavatā hi bhavyain-Matsya 221. 12). The Matsyapurāņa 221. 2 empha tically 815 states that effort is superior. Medhatithi on Manu IV. 137 quotes a subhāşitu those devoid of effort are engaged in calculating the aspects of planets; there is nothing impossible of accomplishment for those who are determined and who are able to put forth spirited efforts. Kaut. (IX. 4 last two verses ), Kām. V, 11, XII. 3-11 emphasize the importance of strenuous efforts. Sukranitisāra (I. 46-58) holds a long disquisition on effort and dair. It contains the following fine sentiments (I. 48-49): 

Men of intellect whose career is honourable regard human effort as the highest (and not fate), while impotent men not being able to make efforts have recourse to fate; but all is centred in both daiva and effort'. Vide Rājanitiprakāśa pp. 312-315 and Nitimayūkha pp. 52-53 for further remarks on daiva and effort. In one place the Mahābhārata (Udyoga 127. 19 ) contains the bravest and loftiest advice 'man should always press forward ( make efforts ), should never bend; striy ing is manliness; one may even break at a point which is not the joint, but should never bend 216, The Brhat-Parāsara smrti X pp. 282-283 contains a long discourse on daiva and puruşakāra.

saklus, i. e. of utsāha, prabhu (or prabhāva) and mantra. These three occur in the Mahābhārata (Aśramavāsika 7. 6). The S. V. p. 46 quotes a sūtra of Gautama (not found in the printed Dh. S.) the three saktis, viz. prabhu, mantra and utsāha are based on that (koša).2164 In VI. 2 Kautilya defines mantra-sakti as the power of the knowledge (of statecraft ), prabhusakti as the power of treasury and army and utsāhasakti as the force of the king's bravery. 817 Kautilya (IX. 1 ) holds a discussion about the relative superiority of these three and gives it as his opinion (as against that of the ācāryas ) that prabhusakti is superior to utsāhasakti and that mantrašakti is superior to prabhusakti. Kām. XV. 32 defines in the three thus : 'the employment of the proper line of policy out of the six upāyas ( sandhi, vigraha &c.) is called mantrašakti; a full treasury and army constitute prabhusakti and activity of the strong is called utsāhasakti; the king possessed of all these three becomes the conqueror, The Nitivākyāmsta (sadguṇyasamuddeśa) p. 322 defines them in the same way.819 According to the Dasakumāracarita 2£0 VIII the goal (or purpose) of a king is determined by mantra (consul tation with ministers about policy ), commencement of actions (for securing the goal) is due to prabhāva and the successful termination of undertakings is brought about by energy. The Parasuramapratāpa (folio 15a) quotes a verse which defines 

prabhusakti' differently viz. as the power to command. Vide also Agnipurāna 241. 1, Mānasollāsa II. 8-10 pp. 91-94. Kām. ( XIII. 41-58 ) brings together the numerous activities of the king. 

A king endowed with valour has to employ several means (upāyas) to extend his dominions and to keep his hold on his own people. According to the Rāmāyana V. 41. 2-3, Manu VII. 109, Yāj. I. 346, Sukra IV. 1. 27 and others the

upāyas are four viz. sīma (conciliation), dana ( giving gifts or presents), bheda (causing dissensions) and daņda (punishment or depriving of property or causing bodily harm ), 281 In the Hāthigumpha Inscription, the king Khāravela (latter half of 2nd century B. C.) states that in the 10th year of his reign he sent, following the policy of danda, sandhi and sāma, an expedition against Bharatvarşa, conquered that land and obtained jewels and precious things ( E. I vol. XX pp. 79, 88). This shows that the theory of the upāyas must have been evolved several centuries before the Christian era. Some others such as Kām. XVII. 3, Matsya 222, %, Agnipurāņa 226. 5-6, Bārhaspatyasutra V. 1-3, Vişnudharmottara II. 146-149 add three more to the above four. Sabhā 5.21 mentions the number seven and Vanaparva 150.42 mentions sāma, dāna, bheda, danda and upeksa. About the additional three there is some difference of opinion, most holding that the three are māyā, upekšā and indrajāla (Kām., Agnipurāna ), while the Bārhaspatyasütra (V. 263 ) says they are māyā, upekşā and vadha and others say they that are māyā, akşa (dice) and indrajāla (Sarasvativilāsa p. 42 ). Māyā means 'deceitful trick'. The Vişnudharmottara II. 148 gives illustrations, such as tying a firebrand to the tail of a bird that often perches on the enemy's camp to produce the delusion that a meteor ( an evil omen) fell down from the sky. Kām. XVII. 54 cites the example of Bhima's meeting Kicaka dressed as Draupadi. Kām. ( XVII. 51-53 ) gives other examples of' māyā. Upekşā consists in not preventing a person from doing what is unjust or being addicted to some vice or engaging in a fight and is illustrated by king Virāta's connivance at the death of Kicaka ( Kām. XVII. 55-57). Indrajāla means 'creat ing an illusion by means of incantations and other tricks' e. g. creating the illusion before the eyes of the enemy that a vast army is coming to attack them or showing that angels are descending to fight against them or making a shower of blood fall in the enemy's camp etc. (Kām. XVII. 58-59, Viseudharmottara II. 149 ). About the four well-known upayas, Manu (VII. 108-109 ) says that for the prosperity of one's kingdom sama and danda (punishment) are preferred, but if

the king's antagonists do not yield to him by the enployment of the first three then he may bring them round by daņda (i. e. fighting and harassing them ) and that ( VII. 198, 200) danda is to be employed as the last resort, since victory is not certain, In the Sāntiparva 69. 23 the view of Bphaspati is quoted 228 that fighting should always be avoided (as far as possible) and that for securing one's purpose three upāyas ( other than fighting) are to be resorted to. Bṛhat-Parāśara X p. 280 also says that a wise man should not resort to fighting and that danda is to be resorted to only when there is no other course left. In Udyoga 132. 29-30 (cr. ed. chap. 130 ) Kunti sends a message through Krşņa to her son: *begging is forbidden to you nor is agriculture appropriate for you; you are a ksatriya living by the power of his arms and a protector against injury (kşatāt trātā). Recover your ancestral share by sama, dāna, bheda, danda and naya': In Udyoga 150 (cr. ed. 148 ) Krspa informs Yudhisthira how he first employed sama, then bheda, then dāna ( viz. giving up the whole kingdom for five villages) and how only danda is the proper recourse in the case of the wicked Kauravas. Hopkins, as very often, being obsessed with his ideas of three strata in the Mahābhārata says that three means appear to be the oldest form and four means a later idea. There is hardly any warrant for this opinion as for many others in the same strain (J. A. O. S. vol. XIII. pp. 182-183 n). The Vişnudharmottara II. 146 speaks of the four upāyas and states that danda as regards a foreign state is open (prakāśa ) i. e. burning and not-open ( aprakāśa i. e. by poison or secret death ). The Mit. on Yāj. I. 346 and Kām. XVIII. 1 say the same thing. The Vişnudharmasūtra III. 38 prescribes that the four upāyas are to be employed at the proper time and according to the attitudes of the hostile king, friendly king, the madhyama and udāsīna kings 223. The Mit. on Yāj. I. 346 expressly states that the four upāyas are to be employed not only in the affairs between kings but also in the lives of all ordinary people and cites a verse wherein a father or teacher addresses a son or pupil making use of all four means 224 Kām.

(Vol. 

17–20 verses 972 ff (pp. 117-122), Nitivākyāmsta pp. 332-336 treat at length of these four upāyas. A few points only are noted here. Sāma is of five kinds viz. recounting the good turns done by each to the other; praising the qualities and actions of the persons to be won over; declaring the relationship of each other; representing the good that will result in future; declaring 'I am yours and I am at your service' ( Kām. XVII. 4-5). Dāna consists in returning what is deposited with one by another, consenting to the taking away by another of one's things, mak ing a gift of something new, giving what the other chooses to ask for, sending at fixed times what has to be given. Bheda ( sowing dissensions) consists in giving heavy bribes or presents to minis ters or feudatories, the crown prince and high officers of the enemy that are dissatisfied for various reasons, creating distrust between the king and his ministers, the rich men and the handsome men in the kingdom by the threat of the loss of life, honour, position, and wealth, by the fear of imprisoninent, by the fear that the king may carry away the beautiful wife of a subject or by suggesting that a handsome young man has his eye on the king's harem, and suggesting to a king that a kinsman desires to secure the kingdom to himself and thereby inducing the king to put out his eyes or cut off his limbs. This is effected by secret spies or persons who are in the pay of both kings ( ubhayavetana, acc. to Mānasollāsa p. 119 v.995 ) 225 Vide Kaut. XI. 1, Matsya chap. 223 and Sukra IV. 1. 25-54 for bheda, Kaut XI. I explains at length how an aspiring conqueror is to sow dissensions between corporations and the leaders of corporations, between chiefs and other people. One or two passages may be quoted by way of sample: "Spies gaining access to these corporations (of warriors and others ) and finding out jealousy, hatred and other causes of quarrel among them should sow seeds of a well-plan ned dissension among them, and tell one of them this man decries you'. Spies may give publicity to the consideration of priority shown to inferior persons in social intercourse in the face of the established custom of recognising the status of other persons by birth, bravery, and social position. In all these disputes the conqueror should help the inferior party with men and money and set them against the superior party. A woman who has disappointed her lover and has been for

given may approach and say to a chief' this chief is troubling me when my mind is set on you; when he is alive I cannot stay here' and thus induce the former to slay the latter.” The Matsyapurāņa 223. 4 states that united people are more than a match even for Indra unless bheda is employed, that dissensions are of two kinds, internal and external, of which the former is more serious. External dissension means the quarrel with a chief, but internal dissension means dissension between a king and his queen or heir apparent or ministers. One should try to prevent dissension with one's own relatives. Santi 69. 23 also advises the conquest of territory by fomenting dissensions. There fore the expedient of divide et impera' has a respectable antiquity. Danda in the case of a king's country consists in sentencing to death or corporal punishment or fine and in the case of the eneiny in fighting, destroying or devastating his country by seiz ing his crops and grain, cattle, wealth, forts and in imprison ing and injuring his people, burning his villages and forests. 

There were certain privileges , that the king enjoyed. His rights to treasure trove have already been referred to (H. Dh. vol. II, p. 146). Kaut. (IV. 1) gives the following rules. The person giving information about the discovery of a mine, jewels or treasure trove gets one-sixth, but if the informer be a servant of the king he gets I's ; treasure trove beyond 100000 paņas went to the king wholly ( the finder being entitled to a th share only up to 100000 paņas of the whole ); a subject who can prove that the treasure trove belonged to his ancestors would get the whole of it; if he takes it without establishing his ancestral ownership he is to be fined 500 panas and 1000 paņas if he appropriated it secretly. The king also took by escheat the property of a person dying without leaving any heir except in the case of brāhmaṇas (vide H. Dh. II, p. 146 where some authorities are cited). This subject will be dealt with at greater length under the next sect ion on law and justice'. The king was also entitled to all property that was lost or given up by the true owner. Vide Gaut. 226 X. 36-38, Vas. 16. 19, Manu VIII. 30-33, Yāj. II. 33, 173-174, Sankha-Likhita. Gaut. and Baud. Dh. S.(I. 10. 17 ) say that the king should preserve for one year articles found after proclaiming the finding by beat of drun, while Manu says that

[ Vol. 

the period is three years. The Mit. on Yāj. II. 33 reconciles these texts by saying that if the true owner comes to the king and establishes his ownership he gets back the entire article without paying anything for safe custody, if the owner comes in the 2nd year he pays it of the price for custody, if in the third year he pays to and if he comes after three years. The finder gets out of the share taken by the king. If the owner does not come at all the finder gets and the king the rest. The king may dispose of the article if none claims it within that period, but if the owner comes after three years and the article has been disposed off, the king should return the equivalent of the portior taken by him. Yāj. II. 174 specifies other scales of charges for the custody of unclaimed animals such as four panas for a horse &c. Another special privilege of the king was that he could not be cited as a witness in a judicial proceeding between private parties. Vide Kaut. III. 11 (p. 175), Manu VIII. 65, Vişnudharma. sūtra 8. %. 

Constitutionally there was no one who could directly bring to book the king guilty of injustice. But the Dharmaśāstra writers insisted that dhar ma was the king of kings (Br. Up. I. 4. 14 quoted above p. 97 n. 125 ), that Varuna was the chastiser of kings (Manu IX. 245); therefore they appealed to the higher nature and conscience of the king and prescribed that if a king levied an unjust fine, he should offer thirty times of that amount to Varuna, throw the amount in water or distribute it among brāhmaṇas ( Yāj. II. 307) and that where an ordinary man would incur a fine of one kārsāpaņa for a wrong, the king certainly deserves to be fined a thousand kārsāpanas (Manu VIII. 336 ). The remarks of Medhātithi on that verse quoted below are very interesting, when he insists on the principle that fines for the same wrong should vary with the capacity to pay 227. Even Kautilya (IV. 13 last two verses ) falls in line with Manu IX. 245 and Yaj. II. 307. But these prescriptions of Manu, Yāj. and Kaut, were counsels of perfection and must have been futile. No king would ordinarily fine himself. Therefore some medieval

digests like the Vivādaratnakara and the Dandaviveka (p. 55 ) interpret these texts as meaning that the word 'rājan' applies here only to subordinate chiefs and not to a king who is independent. 

The flourishing state of a kingdom well governed by a good, well-equipped and active king is very graphically describ ed in the Rāmāyaṇa ( II. 100. 43-46 ) ' I hope your country is full of hundreds of caityas (platforms for sacred trees) and of people who are well-placed; is rendered charming by temples, prapās (sheds where water is distributed to travellers gratis ) and tanks; in which men and women are joyful: which is set off to advan tage by merry gatherings and festivals; the whole extent of which is well cultivated; which is full of cattle and free from injury (to beings ); which does not depend upon rains alone (for its crops ); which is beautiful, free from beasts of prey and all kinds of dangers; which is endowed with mines; which is free from wicked men and enjoys prosperity and happiness'. The Adiparya chap. 109 (cr, ed. chap. 102 ) also contains a fine description of a well-governed and prosperous country. The country was to be full of public wells, gardens and meeting halls ( sabhā). The Visņu-dharmottara I. 13. 2-1% contains an ideal description of ancient Ayodhyā. "It was endowed with hundreds of parks; it celebrated festivals and held gatherings of people; its population was free from disease and had valiant mon; it always resounded with the music of lutes, flutes and tabors; it had fair complexioned, charming hetarai clever in brilliant conversation; its population was always gay; it re sounded with the recitation of the Veda and was endowed with companies of brāhmaṇas ; its market rows were full of men that had applied scents to their bodies ; there was not a man there who was wretched, dirty or emaciated; it stretched for three yojanas on the bank of the Sarayū and was ten yojanas in the middle.' 

CHAPTER VI DURGA ( FORT OR CAPITAL) 

Manu IX, 294 places the capital (pura) even before rastra. Medhatithi (on IX. 295 ) and Kullūka explain that the loss of the capital is a more serious danger than even the loss of some territory, because if the capital, which possesses all the stocks of food, in which are centred the principal elements and the army, is saved, then it is possible to retrieve even lost territory and to protect the country. It is as it were the pivot of the whole machinery of government. Other writers (and even Manu in VII. 69-70) place the capital or fort after the rastra. It is probably due to the geographical situation in North India and the nature of the fighting in ancient times that made the capi tal and forts of great importance in the several elements of the State. The capital mirrored the prosperity of the country and if properly walled also provided security. Yāj. I. 321 says that forts are meant for the safety of the king, the people and the treasury (janakośātmaguptaye). The reason for the construction of forts is well put by Manu VII. 74 viz. that a single archer under the shelter of the fort-wall can fight a hundred of the enemy and a hundred can fight ten thousand. The Pañcatantra (I. 229 and II. 14 ) has a similar verse. Bphaspati quoted by the Rājanītiprakāśa 288 p. 202 states that the king should con struct a fort with walls and a gate for the protection of himself, his wives, the people and the ( wealth ) collected by him. Kaut. (II. 3 and 4) deals at length with the construction of durgas and the laying out of the capital in one of them. He says that in the four quarters of the boundaries of the kingdom forts should be built for offering resistance (to the enemy) on ground naturally fitted for the purpose. He speaks of four kinds of forts viz. 'audaka' (water-protected, which is on an island burrounded by water or on a plain surrounded by low ground), pārvata (mountain one, such as a rocky hill or a cave ), dhūnvana (desert fort, on a waterless tract full of thickets or waste land ), a forest fort full of wagtails and water and

thickets of reed. He says that the first two are suited for the protection of populous places and the last two for the protection of foresters. Vayu 8. 108 • refers to four kinds of durgas. Manu VII. 70, Sānti 56. 35 and 86. 4-5, Vişnudharmagütra III. 6, Matsya 217. 6-7, Agnipurāņa 222. 4-5, Vişnudhar mottara II. 26. 6-9, III. 323. 16-21, Sukra IV. 6 speak of six kinds of forts viz. dhanvadurga ( which is waterless five yojanas round a raised plain), mahidurga (a land fort, which is surrounded by a wall built of stones or burnt bricks, that is at least twelve feet high and twice as high as it is broad), jaladurga ( water fort, surrounded on all sides by deep water), vārksa durga (fort that is surrounded for one yojana on all sides with thorny and tall trees and thorny creepers and bushes), nṛdurga (fort that is guarded by a numerous army of four sections on all sides ), giridurga (mountain fortress, difficult to climb and with only one narrow access). Manu VII. 71 says that the mountain fortress is the best of all, while śānti 56. 35 states that nrdurga is the most difficult to conquer. The Mānasollāsa (II. 5 p. 78) speaks of nine kinds of durgas (adding those built with stones, bricks and mud). The Parasurama- pratāpa enumerates eight kinds of durgas (Rāja vallabhakānda, folio 1) and states that the wall of a fort may be of stones or of baked bricks or of mud. Manu VII. 75 Sabhā 5. 36 ( =Ayodhyā 100, 53), Matsya 217. 8, Kām. IV, 60, Mānasollasa III. 5 (verses 550-555), Sukra IV, 6. 12-13, Vigpu' dharmottara II. 26. 20-88 prescribe that forts should possess plenty of arms, grain, drugs and other materials, wealth, horses, elephants, beasts of burden, brahmaņas, artisans, machines (called Sataghnis acc. to Matsya, that kill a hundred), water and fodder. The Nitivākyāmộta ( durga-samuddesa p. 199) says that there must be means of leaving it secretly, otherwise it will be a prison and that no one should be allowed to enter it or leave it without a pass or without being searched. Kaut. ( II. 3) gives detailed instructions for the construction of fort walls, towers, ditches, pillars, lotus ponds and buildings inside the fort, which are all passed over for want of space. Vide the Rājadharmakānda pp. 28-36 and the Rājadharmakaustubha pp. 115-117 for numerous quotations from the Dhanurveda of Uganas, the Mahābhārata, the Matsya, the Visnudharmottara and other works on durya.

and in II. 20.8 it is narrated that Indra killed the dasyus and destroyed their cities of ayas (copper, huvi dasyün pura āyasir ni tārit ). This shows that walled cities were known even at that distant date. There is difference of opinion as to whether the walls were of mud and wood or of stones and bricks. Vide Hopkins in J. A. O. S. XIII. pp. 174-176. The Tai. S. VI. 2. 3. 1 speaks of the three cities of asuras constructed with ayas, silver and gold (hariņi). In the agni cayana as described in the Sat. Br. thousands of baked bricks were required. The excavations at Mohenjo-daro show that walls were built of burnt bricks ( Marshall, vol. I. pp. 15–26 ), There is no reason to assume that houses, palaces and city walls could not have been built of bricks, simply because no purely Hindu ruins anterior to Alexander have yet been discovered or because Megasthenes describes that Pataliputra had a wall of wooden palisades. One must demur to the remarks of Hopkins on pp. 174-175 of J. A. O. S. vol. XIII. Walls ( prākāra ), toranas (arched gates) and upper stories (attālakas), moats are very often spoken of in connection with capitals in both epics. The gates were sometimes called after cities e. g. in Vanaparva I. 9-10 the Pandavas are said to have gone out of Hastinapura from the gate called Vardhamanapura.229 Vide also Asramavāsi. parva 16. 3. The Mahābhārata states that palaces had dancing halls (nartanāgāra ) attached to them ( Virāța-parva 22. 16 and 25-26). Sānti 69.60 states that the capital was rendered gay by natas (players ) and dancers and Sānti 86 ( 4-15) describes how cities were to be founded in durgas, how they were to be full of music, festivals and merry gatherings (samājot sava) and what stores they should contain. In the Rāmāyaṇa (V.2.50-53 ) Lankā is described as having palaces of seven or eight stories and mosaic pavements. The Bșhatsamhitā (chap. 53) contains in 125 verses very accurate directions and measure ments about palaces, houses &c. (i. e. on vāstušāstra ). It states that the best kind of royal palace was to be 108 cubits broad, that palaces of 100, 92, 84, 76 cubits may be built, that the length in each case was to be one-fourth as much more as the breadth. It speaks of the dimensions of mansions for the commander-in-chief, ministers, the queen, crown prince, purohita, physician &c. In v. 23 it states that the walls may be of baked bricks or of wood.

The Capital 

181 

The king was to have his capital inside a fort or in dependent of it. Manu VII. 70, 76, Aśramavāsi 5. 16-17, Sānti 86.6-10, Kām. IV. 57, Matsya 217. 9ff, Sukra I. 213-217 describe where and how a capital was to be built. Kautilya ( in II. 4) describes at great length how the capital was to be laid out viz. the extent should be demarcated by three royal roads from west to east and three from south to north, the capital should have twelve gates, provided with concealed land and water exits : the chariot roads, the royal roads and roads loading to drona-mukha, sthāniya, the rāstra and pastures should be four daņdas ( 16 cubits) in width. He then prescribes the width of roads for various other purposes. Occupying one-ninth of the whole area of the capital, but to the north from the centre of the capital and in the midst of people of all castes the king's own palace should be built facing the east or north. To the north-east of the palace should be the residences of the king's teacher (ācārya ), purohita, ministers and the sacrificial place and water reservoir. He then assigns appropriate places round about the palace for the offices of the several superintendents, to merchants, principal artisans, brāhmaṇas, kşatriyas, vaisyas, prostitutes, wool workers, śūdras &c. In the centre of the capital were to be constructed apartments for the images of Aparajita, Apratihata, Jayanta and Vaijayanta and the temples of Siya, Kubera, the Aśvins, Lakşmi and Madira (Durgā?). The principal gates named after Brahmā, Yama, Indra and Kārtikeya were to be constructed. At a distance of 100 bows (400 cubits) beyond the ditch, platforms for holy trees, groves and embankments should be built. The cemetery should be to the east or north but to the south for the higher varnas. Heretics and cāndālas should have a place of residence beyond the cemetery. For each group of ten families there must be a well; oil, grain, sugar, salt, medicines, dried vegetables, fire-wood, arms, and other essential commodities should be stored in such large quantities that they might last for several years in case of a siege or invasion. The Matsyapurana ( 217. 9-87) differs from the above description in many ways. It prescribes four wide roads, at the ends of which a temple, the royal palace, the court of justice and the principal gate are to be respectively constructed. Almost the whole of the description in the Matsya is quoted by the Rajanitiprakāša (pp. 208-213) and also in the Rājadharmakanda pp. 28-36. The former also quotes (pp. 214-219) a long passage from the Devipurāpa with regard to the construction of a nagara,182

& pura, a tutta (market), a puri, a pattana €39 and the temples of several deities that are to be built in each, the rites to be observed in measuring out the ground for each and accurately finding out of the east and other directions. Pāṇini ( VII. 3. 14 prācām grāmanagarāņām) distinguishes between grāma and nagara, while Patañjali thereon (vol. III. p. 321 ) explains that grāma, ghosa, nagara, and samvāha are the appellations of different groups or settlements of people. The Vāyupurāņa ( 94. 40 ) separately mentions cities (purani) ghoşas (hamlets of cowherds ), villages and pattanas. Vide Sukranitisāra I. 213-258 for provisions about the laying out of the capital, the palace, the court of justice, other state offices and public buildings, ditches &c. and Yuktikalpataru pp. 22 ff, Vāyu 8. 108 ff, Matsya 130. Sukra (I. 260-267) describes how four royal roads should start from the palace in four direc tions, how the best, middling and inferior royal roads should be 30, 20 and 15 cubits in breadth; he defines jxidyā (a foot-path), vithi (a lane ) and mārga as respectively equal tn 3, 5 and 10 cubits in breadth, that in the capital there should be no narrow street like a padyā or vithi, that even in villages the public road should be at least 10 cubits in width, that all roads should slope down from their middle and that all houses should face the royal road. For a description of Ayodhyā vide Rāmāyapa II. 100. 40-42, which says that it was full of valiant men, had strong gates, was full of elephants, horses, and chariots, was inhabited by energetic people of all castes that were devoted to their duties, that had mansions of various sizes, that it was prosperous and had many physicians. From the Rāmāyana (VI. 112. 42 siktarathyūn tarāpana ) and the Mahābhārata ( Adi. 221. 36) it appears that the roads of the capital were watered. In the Harşacarita (III) Bāna gives a graphic description of Sthānvisvara ( inodern Thanesar ). For the local administration of the capital, vide the duties of the nagaraka described above (p. 149 ) from Kautilya (II. 36 ). From the Paharpur plates ( dated Gupta samvat 159 i. e. 478-9 A D.) it appears that a nagara-śreşthin (the chief of the bankers and traders of the capital) was nominated (probably by the king ). Vide E. I. vol. 20 p. 59 at p. 61. There was probably a board of the elders of the city (pauramukhyas or pauravrddhas

In the Damodarpur copper plates also a nagaraśreşthin is mentioned along with others who were approached for consenting to a purchase of land (E. I. vol. XV at pp. 130, 133, dated Gupta saivat 129). Megasthenes ( in McCrindle's Ancient India ', Fragment XXXIV p. 187) describes the city of Palibothra ( Pataliputra ) and its administration. He says that six committees of five each looked to the affairs of the city and were respectively in charge of (1) industrial arts, ( 2 ) entertainment and care of foreigners, (3) inquiries about births and deaths, ( 4 ) trade and commerce, weights and measures, (5) manufactured articles, ( 6 ) collection of the 10th of the prices of articles sold. Fragments XXV-XXVI (pp. 65-67) inform us that Palibothra was 80 stadiu in length and 15 in width, that in shape it was a parallelogram, that it was surround ed by a wooden wall with holes for discharging arrows and a ditch in front. Arrian states (pp. 209-210 of McCrindle's 'Ancient India') that Palibothra had 570 towers and 64 gates. Patanjali in his Mahābhāsya frequently brings in Pātaliputra (e. g. in vol. I p. 380 he states that Pātaliputra is alongside of the river Sona, on Pān. II. 1. 16 ), in vol. II. p. 311 ( vārtika 4 on Pān. IV. 3, 66 ) he refers to its walls and to its palaces, in vol. II. p. 321 ( on Pāṇ. IV. 3. 134 ). In Ha-Hien's time (399-414 A. D.) the royal palace and halls in the midst of the city built of stone still existed and were so grand that they were then believed to have been the work of spirits ( vide Legge p. 77). Vide Rhys Davids' 'Buddhist India' pp. 34-41 for the ancient Indian capitals in the 7th century BC. 

In the Bhagavatapurāņa (IV. 18. 30-32 ) it is narrated that Přthu, son of Vona, first levelled the earth, established human habitations in villages, towns, capitals, forts &c., and that before Pșthu people resided where they liked and there were no such groups as villages or towns. Bhrgu quoted by Sridhara accord ing to Rājaniti-kaustubha defines grāma as the habitation of brāhmaṇas, their hired labourers and sūdras, that kharvata is on the bank of a river and of a mixed character, one side being a village and the other a town. Saunaka quoted by the Rājansti-kaustubha ( pp. 103-4) defines kheta as a place where brahmanan, ksatriyas and vaisyas reside, that a place where all castes reside is called a town, that brāhmaṇa householders should be established on soil that is whitish and has sweet odour, kşatriyas should be established in towns where the soil is reddish and wafts & sweet odour and vaiśyas on yellowish soil. 

CHAPTER VII 

KOSA (TREASURY OR FINANCE) 

Kaut (II. 1) states that a king whose treasury is depleted preys upon the citizens and the rural population and (II. 8) very 231 rightly remarks that all undertakings depend upon koša (financial position of the king), therefore the king must pay the first attention to kośa. Gautama (as cited by 8. V. p. 46 ) holds that kośa is the basis or support of the other six elements of the State. The Sāntiparva 119. 16 calls upon the king to guard his finances with great effort, since kings depend upon kośa, which tends to the prosperity ( of the kingdom). Kām. XIII. 33 states that it is on the lips of all that the king is dependent on koga. Sānti 133 contains a eulogy of kośa. The Vişnudharmottara II. 61, 17 says that kośa is the root of the tree of State. The two great pillars of the Indian States in ancient India were the revenue and the army. Manu VII. 65 says that kośa and the government of the realm depend on the king i. e. they should be the personal concern of the king. Yāj. (I. 327-328) recommends that the king should personally look into the income and expenditure every day and keep in his treasury buildings whatever is brought by those who are appointed to bring gold and wealth. Kām. V.77 and Sukra I. 276-278 say the same. The Rājataran gini (VII. 507-508) tells us that king Kalasa of Kashmir (1063–1089 A. D.) kept accounts like a merchant, closely watched income and expenditure and had a clerk by his side with chalk and bhūrja ( birch leaf) to write upon. The principal means of filling the treasury is taxation. It is therefore neces sary to consider first the principles of taxation as evolved by our writers. The first principle was that the king could not levy, according to the smrtis, taxes at his pleasure or sweet will, that the rates of taxes which the king was entitled to lovy were fixed by the smrtis and varied only according to the

Principles of taxation

commodity and also according as the times were normal or there was danger of invasion or some other calamity impending. For example, Gaut. X. 24, Manu VII. 130, Vişnu Dh. S. III. 22-23 declare that the king may ordinarily take a sixth part of the grain-crops or produce of the soil, but Kaut. (V. 2), Manu (X. 118 ), Santi 87, Sukra IV. 2. 9-10 permit the king to take even one-third or one-fourth part of the crops in times of dis tress (āpad). It has however to be noted that Kautilya requires the king to beg (yāceta ) of the people for this heavy taxation, he employs the word pranaya ( request) for such demands, such taxation was not to be levied from inferior lands, and he expressly says that such a demand for excessive taxation is to be made only once and not twice in the same distress. 282 Santi ( 87. 26-33 ) contains a specimen of a long address to be given to the people when a king demands higher taxation in danger (such as 'if the enemy invades you, you will lose all including even your wives, the enemy will not restore to you what he robs you of' &c.). The word 'pranaya' occurs in this sense in the Junagadh Inscription of Rudradāman (E. I. vol. VIII. p. 36 ll. 15-16). Another principle laid down in somewhat poetical and picturesque language is that taxation should be felt by those taxed as light and not heavy or excessive. The Udyogaparva 233 ( 34. 17-18 ) states ' just as a bee draws honey but at the same time leaves the flowers uninjured, so the king should take wealth from men without harming them. One (a bee ) may search each flower (for honey) but should not cut the very root just like a garland-maker, but not like a coal maker'. Manu (VII. 129 and 140 ) laconically puts the matter thus just as the leech, the calf and the bee take their sustenance little by little, so must the king draw from his kingdom annual taxes little by little. Let the king not cut up his own root (by levying no taxes ) nor the root of others by 234 excessive greed'. Šānti (88

4-6 ) states that the king should draw (taxes ) from the realm lightly in the way the bee draws honey from the trees, he should do so in the way of the calf and should not bruise the udders (as the calf does not ). Those verses also refer to the action of the leech, of the tigress carrying her cuba between her jaws and the rat gnawing at the feet of sleeping men. These ideas pervaded society so much that the same figure of the bee is instanced as regards the Buddhist bhikkhu's importu nity for alms in the Dhammapada (verse 49). The king should act like a gardener who prepares garlands without harming the trees and their leaves and should not act like one who prepares coals from trees (Santi 71,20) 235. Manu VII. 139 requires that the king should not through greed tax the subjects heavily, as he would thereby cut off the roots (i. e. prosperity and content ment) of the people, nor should he cut off his own roots (i. e. reduce himself to bankruptcy) by levying no taxes. A third principle of taxation was that when increasing taxes the rise should be gradual and a little at a time ( Santi 88. 7-8). Taxes were to be recovered at a proper time and proper place (Santi 88. 12 and Kam. V. 83-84)226. When taxing traders the king should make allowance for the price they had to pay, for the chances of selling the commodity (in his kingdom ), the dis tance over which the merchandise was brought, what they must have spent for their food and condiments and the cost of guard

With the above principles of taxation one may compare Adam Smitb's famous canons: (1) the subjects of every state ought to contribute towards the support of the Government as nearly as possible in proportion to their respective abilities i. e, in proportion to the revenue which they respectively enjoy under the protection of the State. (2) The tax which each individual is bound to pay ought to be certain and not arbitrary. The time of payment, the manner of payment, the quantity to be paid ought to be clear and plain to the contributor and to every other person. (3) Every tax ought to be levied at the time or in the manner in which it is nost likely to be convenient for the contributor to pay it, (4) Every tax ought to be so contrived as both to take out and keep out of the pockets of the people as little as possible over and above what it brings into the public treasury (vide. Wealth of nations' ed. by Rogers, 1869, vol: II. pp. 414-416.)

ing the merchandise (Manu VII. 127=Santi 8713-14)237 In the case of artisans, before taxing them, the king has to pay regard to the labour and skill involved and to the necessaries of life required by them (Santi 87, 15). Every one, however poor, must contribute something to the finances of the realm. Manu (VII. 137-138) says that even a very poor man who maintains himself by following some occupation should be asked to contribute every year something in the nature of kara ( a tax), while workers (like cooks ), artisans (like blacksmiths ), šūdras who subsist by manual labour (like porters ) should be asked to contribute one day's work to the king in a month. Vide Gaut. X. 31-34, Visnu Dh. Ś. III. 32 for the same. But Sukra IV.2. 121 says that workers and artisans should do one day's work for the king gratis in a fortnight. Gaut. X. 34 adds that the king must supply them with food on the day they work gratis. The importance of a gold and silver reserve was well understood. Kām. (IV. 62-64) says 238 that the king's kosa should have many sources for filling it, but few outlets of expenditure, it should be full of all desired kinds of wealth, guarded by trusty officers, rich in pearls, gold and jewels, it should have been acquired according to sõstric rules, be capable of bearing great strain of expenditure and that kośn is to be preserved only for the purpose of securing the two goals viz. dlarm and artha, for affording maintenance to the servants engaged by the king and as a safeguard against calamities. Sukra IV. 2-3 remarks that kośa is accumulated for the upkeep of the army and for the benefit of the people and for performing sacrifices. Gaut. X. 28-29, Manu VII. 128, VIII. 306-308, Nār. (prakirnaka 48 ) and others say, als has beon already stated, that taxation is meant for the protection of the subjects and that it is the king's wages ( petan) for the protection he affords. Manu IX. 305 compares the king taking taxes to the sun that produces vapour from the seas (in order to return it in the form of rain, as the Raghu vamsa I. 18 very happily puts it). Kām. (V. 78-79) enumerates eight principal sources (called aştenarija) of filling the treasury

through the action of the heads of the departments viz. agricul ture, trade-routes (both on land and water ), the capital, water embankments, catching of elephants, working mines and collect ing gold &c., levying wealth (from the rich ), founding towns and villages in uninhabited spots. The Mānasollasa (II. 4 verses 539-540 p. 77) advises the king to spend ordinarily three-fourths of the yearly revenues and save one-fourth. Sukra (I. 315-317 ) prescribes that the king should save 1/6 of his total annual income and should spend 1/2 of the whole on the army and one-twelfth each on charity (to the learned, the poor and helpless &c.), ministers, inferior officials, and his private purse or expenses. Sukra IV. 2. 26 requires the king to have as much stock of grain as would be required for three years' consumption in his country. In IV. 2. 13 he sets before the king the impossi ble ideal that his treasury should be so full that he can support his army for 20 years if no taxes from agriculture or tolls were raised or no fines were recovered. The Mānasollāsa (II. 4. 394, 397 p. 64 ) says that the king's treasury should be always full of gold, silver, jewels, ornaments and costly clothes, that pure gold in the form of nişkas (coins ) or bars or ornaments should be held in the treasury. Kaut. (IV. 3) as stated above permitted the king in famines to make the rich disgorge their wealth, In V.2 he remarks that if after making special requests for additional taxation, when the treasury is empty and some danger is impending, to the cultivators, merchants, wine-sellers, prostitutes and those who rear pigs, poultry, cattle &c., the king may request the rich to give as much of their gold as they can and the king may honour them by bestowing on them a post at his court, or the dignity of an umbrella, a turban or some decoration in return for their wealth239. He permits the king in calamities to take away the wealth of the corporations (sanghas) of heretics and of temples also, to set up all of a sudden on one night a god or a platform ( caitya) for a holy tree or a sacred place for a man of miraculous powers and provide for fairs and merry gatherings there and secure the necessary money.

240. Compare note 164 above about the Mauryas who wanting money set up images, according to Patañjali. The Rājatarangiņi (V. 166-177) describes the exactions of king Sankara-varman of Kashmir (883-902) A. D. He plunder. ed 64 temples under the pretext of supervision. He imposed taxes on grhaksiya (1. e. on upanayana, marriages &c.). In tbe 11th century king Harna of Kashmir plundered most of the temples (Rājatarangini VII, 1090).

recommends many other tricks and dodges for securing money, which ere passed over. Perhaps the only redeeming feature of these devices is that Kautilya is careful to point out that they were to be employed only against the seditious and the irreligi ous and not against others (V.2 'evum dūšyesvadhārmikeșu varteta netareşu'). Vide Nitivākyāmsta (kosa-saniuddesa) p. 205 for similar provisions to replenish a depleted treasury. The Parašurāmapratāpa (Rājavallabhakānda, folio 27b) quotes a verse which recommends resort to alchemy for replenishing the treasuryesla. Sukra IV.2. 11 advises the king when in financial difficulties to promise interest to the rich and take their wealth and to return it with interest when the difficulties are got over$41. Sānti ( 88. 29-30) asks4% the king to honour the wealthy men in his kingdom, since they constitute an important element of the realm and are the most eminent among all beings and to request them 'confer along with me favours on the people'. 

Several reasons are assigned for people's payment of taxes to the king. Gaut. X. 28 says that they should do so because he protects them. In some places the idea put forward is that taxes are the wages (vetana ) of the king and that the subjects made a contract with the king Manu to that effect. Vide santi 67 and 70.10, Baud. Dh. S. I. 10. 1, Nār. 18. 48, Kaut. I. 13 (quoted on p. 21 above). Kāt. 243 (verses 16-17) states that as the king is the owner of the earth but not of other kinds of wealth, he is entitled to get the sixth part of the produce of land and that since human beings reside on land they are declared to be owners (in ordinary parlance, but they have only a qualified ownership). Several kinds of taxes are mentioned in the dharmaśāstras, arthaśāstras and the inscriptions. The oldest

word for a tax paid to the king is' bali'. Rg. VII. 6. 5844 and X. 173. 6 speak of the common people as 'ballhrt' (bringers of bali, tribute or tax for the king). In the Tai. Br. (II. 7. 18. 3 ) it is said the people bring ball to him'. In the Ait. Br. (35.3 ) the raibya is characterized as 'balikrt' (payer of taxes tu another), since brahmanas and kşatriyas were mostly exempt from taxat ion. Vide Prof. Hopkins' Social condition of the ruling class' J. A.O. 8. vol. XIII. p. 89 and Fick p. 119 (as to the evidence of the Jātakas on taxation). Manu VII. 80, Matsya 215. 57, Rāmāyana III. 6. 11, Visnu Dh, S. III. 22 employ the word "bali' in the sense of the 6th part of the produce of land that the king levied as tax. In the Rummindei Pillar Inscription of Asoka (Corpus I. I. vol. I. p. 164 ) it is said that the village of Lummini was made free from the payment of 'bali', but had to pay one-eighth share. 148 Here 'bali' is contrasted with 'bhāga' which is a general term. The word 'kara' appears to mean a tax in general. Vide Ap. Dh. S, II. 10. 26. 10, Manu VII. 128, 129, 133, Vas. 19. 23, Vişnu Dh. S. III. 26-27. The word 'bhāga' (share) is also general and means the king's dues on land, trees, drugs, cattle, wealth &c. Vide Manu VII. 130-131, VIII. 305, Vispu Dh. S. III. 25. This meaning of 

· bhāga 'is ancient. We saw above (p. 112 ) that bhāgadugha is one of the ratnins of the king. The Amarakosa treats buli, kara, and bhāgn as synonymous. 

The word 'sulka' generally means the tolls or customs duties levied from vendors and purchasers on merchandise carried into or out of the kingdom (Sukranītisāra IV. 2. 108). The Mahābhāsya on the vārtika āyasthanebhyasthak' on Pān. IV. 2. 104.gives saulkika and gaulmika as examples, indicating thereby that sulka or toll was levied as a source of income (āya) at the toll-gate. 

The principal and perennial sources of income to the state were three viz. the king's share of the produce of land, tolls and customs duties, fines levied from wrongdoers or defeated litigants (vide Santi 71.10 and Sukra IV. 2. 13). From this and from Manu X. 119-120 it appears that the principal tax-payers

In Manu VIII. 307 quoted in the Dandaviveka of Vardhamāna (p. 5) it is said that the king who, without affording protection, levies buli, kara, śruku, pratibhogu (pratibhāga in the printed smrti ) and cança (fines) goes at once to hell and Vardhamāna explains kuru as the dues recovered every month from villagers and city-dwellers ( every month or twice a year in Bhadrapada or Pausa according to Kullūka ), sulka as the twelfth share re cuvered from traders, pratibhuga as the dues in the form of fruits, flowers and vegetables presented every day. A few remarks on these and other taxes inust be made here. Manu VII. 130, Gant. X. 24, Vişnu Dh. S. III. 22, Mānasollāsa ( 11. 3. 163 p. 44 ) and several others prescribe that the king is entitled to the 6th, 8th or 12th part ( only sixth in Vişnu, also 10th in Gaut.) of the yield of grain from land. Bphaspati and the Visnudharmot tara + ( II. 61. 60-61 ) quoted in the Rājanitiprakāśa (pp. 262 263) make it clear under what circumstances these different shares are to be taken: viz. the king, takes 16 of $ūkudhanya (awned or bearded grain like wheat and barley ), 1/8 from simbidhānya (grain in pods), 10th part from crops grown on land that was fallow for many years, 1/8th from lands sownin the rainy season and one-sixth from land: that have spring crops. The tax was to be paid once every year or once in six months according to the custom of the country. The varying rates prescribed by Kautilya have been indicated in describing the duties of the sitādhyaksa. Sukra (IV. 2. 121-122 ) gives a salutary rule that if a cultivator constructs a tank, a well or an artificial water-course or brings under cultivation land previously fallow, the king should not levy a tax thereon till the person making the expenditure has recovered twice the amount spent by him. Kaut. (II. 1 ) provides that the king may show favour (thugrulu ) to the cultivators by supplying them with seed, cattle and money and that they should return the advances by easy instalments and that the king shall bestow favours and romissions (parihūra) in such a way that they might tend to swell the treasury and not tend to its

depletion. 27 It has already been stated that according to the smrtis the ordinary share of the king was one-sixth, but that in case of the danger of invasion or similar calamity he was allow ed to raise it to one-fourth. Megasthenes (Fragment I, p. 42 ) says that no person is permitted to own land and that besides the land tribute people pay into the royal treasury a fourth part of the produce. This shows that the tax on land was very heavy in the times of Candragupta probably owing to his wars to drive away the Greeks and the huge armies that he had to employ. Manu VII. 130, Gaut. X. 25, Visņu Dh. S. III. 24, Mānasollāsa ( II. 3. 163 p. 44 ) hold that the king is entitled to the 50th part of the cattle reared by herdsmen and of the interest earned by those who lend money at interest. This last appears to be analogous to modern income-tax. The Sukranitisāra IV. 2. 128 makes the tax to be 's on the interest earned by money-lending, 248 Visnu adds cloth to these two. Manu VII. 131-132, Gaut. X. 27, Visnu Dh. S. III. 25, Vişnudharmottara II. 61. 61-63 and Mānasollāsa lay down that the king is entitled to a sixth part of trees, meat, honey, clarified butter, perfumes (like sandal-wood ), medicinal plants (like gudūci), rasa ( salt &c.), flowers, roots (like turmeric), fruits, leaves ( like palm leaves), vegetables, grass, hides, articles manufactured from bamboo slips, earthenware, articles prepared from stones. Vişnu adds deer hides to these. 

· Sulka is of two kinds, what is levied on goods carried by land and what is levied on goods carried by water (Mit. on Yāj. II. 263). Gaut. X. 26 and Vişnu Dh. S. III. 29 state that the sulka is 1/20th part on merchandise for sale ( bought and sold in the country itself) which is interpreted by some (like Haradatta and Nandapandita ) as meaning that 5 per cent of the price of articles sold should be taken by the king as tax, while the Rājanitiprakaśa (p. 264 ) explains that the king is entitled only to five per cent of the difference between the cost price and the sale price of merchandise. Manu VIII. 398 also is susceptible of these two interpretations, as the commentaries of Medbātithi and Kullūka show. The Vişnu Dh. S. (III. 29-30) prescribes that the king takes one-tenth on merchandise produced in his own country and one-twentieth on goods imported from a foreign

country. Yāj. II. 261 says that the sulka on goods is twentieth part of the prices of the goods. Kaut. (II. 21 ) in his chapter on the superintendent of tolls ( sulkādhyaksa ) sets out several rules, of which a few interesting ones are given here. Com modities intended for marriage or taken by a bride from her parents to her husband or meant as presents or for the purpose of sacrifices or the accouchement of women or for the worship of gods, or for the ceremonies of caula, upanayana, godūna, or for the observance of a vrata or for the consecration of a person for a sacrifice and for other special ceremonies shall be allowed to go free of tolls. Whatever commodities would cause harm to the realm or are useless should be destroyed; whatever is of great benefit and seeds not easily available should be allowed to be imported without charge 249 He further says (II. 22 ) that sulka is levied on exports and imports of merchandise and that on imports the tax will be one-fifth of the price of the commodities ( as a general rule ) and prescribes varying rates (1/6, 1/10, 1/15, 1/20, 1/25 ) on different kinds of articles. In II. 28 (on the superintendent of shipping ) Kautilya gives further rules some of which have been already noted. He prescribes rules for ferries also, viz. that brāhmanas, ascetics, children, very old people, sick men, messengers, pregnant women are to be provided with free passes by the superintendent enabling them to use the ferries. A man with a load and small animals were to pay one māsa at a ferry, a cow or a horse two māsas and so on. The Mānasollāsa (II. 4. vy. 374-376 p. 62 ) prescribes that the king should well guard all harbours (velā-pura) that are near the sea, that when the boats of sailors residing in his own country return to the harbour the king should charge one-tenth (of the price of goods brought ) as the duty and that when foreign boats are driven to his harbour by an unfavourable wind, the king should confiscate all their merchandise or may give a little to the owners of those boats. In this connection a very interesting inscription may be referred to. The Motupalli pillar Inscription 850 of the Kakatiya king Ganapatideva (of

( Vol 

1244-45 A. D.) issues (E. I. vol. XII p. 195) a charter of security ( abhaya-śāsana) to the sailors who ply between towns in dif ferent countries, islands and continents : 'when ships that made voyages from one country to another were driven or were shattered or touched at a place that was not meant as a place of call, owing to unfavourable winds, former kings forcibly took away all commodities therein such as gold, elephants, horses &c.; but we, considering that wealth is dearer than life itself, have with kindness decided to give everything except the fixed Sulka to those sailors who undertake the great venture of cross ing the sea, so that thereby we shall secure fame and righteous ness; the sulka fixed is as follows'. About sulka to be levied on goods brought by the sea the Baud. Dh. S. (1. 10.15-16) prescribes that it is 10 per cent of the cargo except one best article (which is totally exempted). In the Kharepatan grant of the Silāra king Rattarāja dated sake 930 it is provided that one golden gadiyūna was levied as duty on each vessel that came froni another country (dvipāntarāyāta-vahitrāt) and one golden dharana had to be paid on each vessel coming from the district of Kandalamūliya excepting Cemulya (modern Cheul) and Candrapura. Vide E. I. vol. III. p. 292 at p. 301. Sukra (IV. 2. 109-111) lays down some very reasonable rules viz. on the same commodity sulka is to be taken in the same country by the king only once and never more than once; the king may take either 1/16, 1/20 or 1/32 from the vendee or vendor; no śulka is to be taken from the vendor when he has to sell his goods at the same price at which he bought them or for less than the cost price; the king should always take from the buyer the proper gulka after seeing what profit he is going to make. Nār, (sambhūya-samutthāna verses 14-15 ) lays down that whatever is to be used by śrotriyas ( brāhmaṇas learned in the Vedas ) for domestic purposes is exempt, but not what they may employ in trade; the gifts received by brāhmaṇas, the property of stage players, whatever is carried on a man's shoulderson all these no šulka must be levied. The exemption of brāhmaṇas and others from taxation has already been dealt with in H. Dh. vol. II. pp. 143-145. Gaut. X. 9-12, Ap. Dh. S. II. 10. 26. 10-16, Vas. I. 42-46 and 19. 23-24, Manu. VIII. 394 exempt a learned brahmana, the women of all varpas, all boys before the signs of puberty appear, all those who stay with a teacher for study, ascetics who are intent on dharma, sūdras that do menial work such as washing the feet of higher varnas, the blind, the deaf and dumb, the diseased, the cripple, an old man of 70 years or

more. Though these really required more protection than most people, humanity and higher feelings made them exempt from taxes from very ancient times. The claims to exemption were probably exaggerated and not respected in practice. For example, Nārada (VI. 14 ) states that the king is not to levy tolls or customs duties on articles required by śrotriyas for domestic use but if they engaged in trade they had to pay taxes on merchandise.251 The Mit. on Yāj. II. 4 states that the six exemp tions mentioned in Gaut. (VIII. 12-13) apply only to a very learned brāhmaṇa and not to all brāhmaṇas. Manu. VII. 133 provides that a king even when he has lost everything should not levy a tax on śrotriyas and relying on this the Vaijayanti explains Visnu Dh. S. III. 26 as referring only to learned brāhmanas. The Rāmāyana (III. 6. 14)25 la states, differing from other authorities, that the king shares one-fourth of the merit of munis ( ascetics ) dwelling in his kingdom. There was a corresponding liability on the king ; viz. he shared half and half in the demerit due to the sins committed by the subjects that are not properly restrained by him (Yaj. I. 337). Manu and Vişnu. Dh. S. III. 28 and Vişnudharmottara II. 61. 25 say that he reaps the sixth part of the sin of his subjects. 

Kaut, in II. 15 mentions numerous kinds of taxes or dues that were levied by the king. It is not possible to explain many of the terms used by him. In the ancient inscriptions, when making grants of a village and the like, it is usual for the kings to specify the exemptions from taxes and dues that went with the grant. Such exemptions were called parihūra, which word occurs in Kautilya and also in the Hāthigumpha Inscription of Khāravela ( in the 2nd century B.C., E. I. vol. xx at p. 9) where we read 'bamhanānam jātim parihāram dadāti'. In certain 

early records even, these exemptions are said to be eighteen, e. 8. in the Hirahadagalli plate of Sivaskandavarman ( E. I. vol. I. p. 6 ) and 258 the Omgudu plate of Vijayaskandavarman

Fines as a source of revenue will be discussed in the next section about 'law and justice'. The king had numerous other sources of income. Kaut (II. 12 ) describes the duties of the superintendent of mines. Every thing dug up from mines belonged to the king ( Vispudharmasūtra III. 55). According to Manu VIII. 39 and Medhātithi thereon the king is entitled to a half (or some share , &c.) of the ore dug out of mines, as he is the lord of the earth and gives protection. In modern times under sec. 69 of the Bombay Land Revenue Code, Government have a right to all mines and minerals. The Parasuramapratāpa \#sta quotes a verse : 'Brahmā arranged that the king was ( to be ) the owner of all wealth and specially (wealth) that is inside the earth, while Kāt. (16-17) says ( vide note 243 ) 'the king is declared to be the lord of the land, but never of other kinds of wealth ; therefore he should secure the sixth part of the fruits of land, but not otherwise at all. Since human beings reside on it (land) their ( qualified ) ownership thereof has been declared'. For further discussion of the theory of the king's ownership of all land, vide H. of Dh. vol. II. pp. 865-869. The State itself manufactured salt, took its share in salt manufactured by private persons and levied as State dues on imported salt.

(evamādikehi atthārasajātiparihūrehi). Vide Vilavatti grant of Pallava king Simbavarman for a long enumeration of taxes collected from villages in South India in E.

Mānadollāba ( II. 3. verses 332 and 361 ) asks the king to guard mines of gems, gold and silver and declares that the Creator made the king the ruler over all wealth and especially over what is inside the earth. Rudradāman (150 A. D.) boasts that he filled his treasury by means of bali, sulka and bhāga levied according to the sõstras and that his treasury overflowed with heaps of gold, silver, diamonds, lapis lazuli and other gems ( E. I. vol. VIII. p. 36 at p. 44). Kaut (IV.1) says that those who sweep the dust ( near mines &c.) should get one-third of the valuable things found and the king should get two-thirds and all jewels. The king had also monopolies in certain matters. He alone could catch elephants. Kaut (II. 31-32 ) and Mānasollāsa (II. 3, pp. 44-58) deal with this matter, the latter describing several methods of catching elephants. Medhātithias3 on Manu VIII. 400 says that kings have a monopoly as to elephants because it is well-known that they are most useful to them and he specifies certain monopolies such as those in saffron, silken cloth and wool, horses, pearls and jewels. Megasthenes (Fragment XXXVI. p. 90) states that a private person was not allowed to keep an elephant or a horse and that those animals were held to be the special property of the king. 

The king recovered a sort of road cess through officers called antapāla ( guardians of borders or boundaries ) viz. 11 pana on each cart loaded with merchandise, half a paņa on each head of cattle, Ith pana on minor quadrupeds, and one māşa on a load carried on a man's shoulders (Kaut. II. 21 p. 111). Sukra IV, 2. 129 permits for the repairs to the roads a tax on those who use roads. Revenues were raised in numerous other ways such as by charging for stamping weights and measures, by fees levied from keepers of gambling balls, from players, singers and musicians, from prostitutes, from forests and pastures &c. Brhat-Parāśara X. p. 282 allows the king in a financial crisis to use even temple funds and make them good when freed from his difficult position. Similarly it allows the king ( in difficulty ) to take the wealth of usurers, of low people,

of heretics and prostitutes, as the continuance and prosperity of temples and the others depend upon the king, * 

The Rājatarangiņi (VII. 1008 ) notices that a tax was levied on Kashmirians performing grāddha at Gayā. An inscrip tion of Vikramāditya V found near Gadag dated sake 934 ( 1012-13 A. D.) refers to taxes levied on upanayana, marriages, vedio sacrifices &c. (E. I. vol. 20 p. 64). It appears that the king of Anahilavād, Siddharāja (1094-1143 A. D.), levied a tax on pilgrims going to Somanātha at the frontier town Bāhuloda and it is said that the tax yielded 72 lakhs of rupees a year, which Siddharāja remitted for the sake of and at the inter vention of his mother ; vide Bom. G. vol. I. part 1 p. 17% and Prabandha-cintāmaņi (p. 84, Tawney). The amount is probably very highly exaggerated in order to glorify Siddharāja, but this shows that the yield of the pilgrim tax must have been substantial. The Mānasollāsa in its great desire to help the king with the accumulation of wealth advises the king even to resort to alchemy. 255 

A question may be asked: what were the means of preven ting a king from being over-exacting and tyrannical in his taxes? Kaut. (VII. 5. pp. 276–277) cites at great length the causes that lead to the impoverishment of the subjects, to their being greedy and disaffected. Among these he mentions 256 

not paying what ought to be paid and exacting what ought not to be exacted, not punishing the guilty and severely punishing the guilty, not protecting the people against thieves and robbing them of their wealth'. He then states that when the subjects become impoverished they become greedy and when greedy they become disaffected and voluntarily go over to the side of the king's enemy or destroy their own king.

place Kautilya (XIII. 1) suggests 258 that a conqueror may employ spies who should encourage the subjects of his enemy suffering from famine, depredations of thieves and wild tribes to tell their king, 'we shall beg the king for favours (remission of taxes or help in the way of seeds &c.) but if he does not agree to bestow favours we shall go to another country'. So the threat of disaffection and migrating to another country were the deterrents against the tyranny of heavy taxation according to Kautilya. Sānti 87. 36 says 257a that if the vaisyas (gominah, who bore the brunt of taxation) were neglected, they may dis appear from the country and dwell in forests. Manu (VII. 111 112) warns kings who through folly rashly oppress their king doms that they may ere long lose their own lives and those of their relatives and also their kingdoms. Yāj. (I. 340-341 ) is even more emphatic and says that the king who seeks to increase his treasury with wealth extracted by unjust means from his realm loses his wealth in no time and meets destruction along with his relatives. The fire springing from the wrath caused by the harassment of the subjects does not coase without burning the family, the wealth and the life of the king.' Katyāyana (v. 19) harps on the spiritual consequences: the king who unjustly takes from his kingdom taxes, fines, share of crops and tolls, incurs 868 sin.' Sukra 259 (II. 319-321 and 370) emphasizes the keeping of daily, monthly and yearly accounts and the entering of the several items of income on the left side of the account and of those of expenditure on the right. The Nitivākyāmộta esan refers to the appointment of auditors when there is discrepancy in the items of income and expenditure.

CHAPTER VIII 

BALA (THE ARMY). 

Bala is also called danda in Kaut and elsewhere. Accord ing to Sumantu dapda means 'punishment, corporal or monetary' and the army with its four arms is included by Sumantu under koša ( acc. to $. V. p. 46).260 In the Rgveda we have frequent references to armies, weapons, battles &c. The word senāni occurs in Rg. X. 84. 2 where Manyu ( martial Fury ) is invoked to be the Commander.261 Rg. VI. 75 is full of references to bows, arrows, armour, bow-strings, quiver, charioteer, horses, chariots &c. Kām. (XIII. 34-37 ) states that the king possessed of a sound financial position increases his depleted army, supports his own subjects and is depended upon even by his enemies. All the following result from the possession of a (powerful ) army viz. increase of the wealth of one's friends and enemies and of the ( king's) territories, prompt attainment of objects that seemed distant, protection of what is already secur ed, destruction of the armies of the enemy, the keeping together of one's army. Most authorities agree in saying that troops are of six kinds viz. maula (hereditary ), bhrta or bhṛtaka or bhitya (hired troops ), śreni (guild troops ), mitra ( troops of an ally or friendly power or feudatories ), amitra ( troops that once belonged to the enemy ), atavi or ātavika (wild tribes as troops). Vide Kaut. 242 IX. % (first sentence ), Kām. XVIII. 4, Agnipurāna 242. 1-2, Mānasollāsa ( II. 6, verge 556 p. 76). The first three works say that each earlier variety of troops is superior to each later one. Maula troops corresponded to the modern standing army, since Kaut. (IX. 2) prefers them on the ground that they depend on the king for maintenance and are being constantly drilled. They most probably consisted of persons who and whose ancestors got tax-free lands in lieu of military service. The Sabba parva 5, 63 appears to refer to four kinds ( omitting śreni and amitra ) and Yuddhakanda 17. 24 refers to five ( omitting śrepi).

Kinds of armed forces 

201 

The Asramavāsikaparva 263 (7.7-8) names five kinds (except amitra ) and states that maula and mitra armies are superior to the rest and hired troops and śreņi troops are each other's equals. This division of armies into various kinds is mentioned in the grant of Dhruvasena I of Valabhi in Gupta-Valabhi year 206 (E. I. vol. XI. p. 106, where the king is said to have acquired the kingdom with the help of maula, bhrta, mitra and śreni armies ). Mānasollāsa defines the atavika 264 army as consisting of nişādas, mlecchus and similar castes dwelling in the vicinity of mountains and amitra troops as soldiers who once belonged to an enemy king but being defeated were taken captive and made slaves. Accord ing to the Rājanitiratnākara (p. 38) 'aribala' means 'troops that come to a king after leaving the king's enemy'. Kām. XVIII. 7 says that the ātavika troops are, by nature, irreligious, greedy, smāryas and non-observers of truth. They correspond to the pendharis and freebooters of later times. The reasons why hered itary and other troops are superior to amitra and āțavika varie ties are explained at great length by Kaut. IX. 2 and Kām. XVIII. 5-9. Kaut. (IX. 2) states that an amitru army led by an ārya is superior to wild tribe troops. Both of them are out for plunder and in case no plunder can be had or when there is a disaster they may prove as dangerous as snakes. By greni-bala he has in mind the organized bands of soldiers to whom he refers elsewhere as ' vārtāśastropajivinah' (vide p. 89 above ). As it is not unlikely that members of trade-guilds either them. selves learnt the profession of arms or engaged soldiers for the protection of their merchandise and property, these could be pressed into his service by a king in case of need and were distinguished from the hereditary army and hired troops as 

sreni-bala'. Differing from the ācāryas that troops composed of brāhmaṇas, ksatriyas, vaiśyas and sūdras are superior for en listment in the order of the castes, Kaut. holds that an army of ksatriyas well-trained in the wielding of arms or an army of

vaišgas and sūdras having greater numerical strength is better than an army composed of brāhmaṇa soldiers, since an enemy may win over the latter army by prostrating himself before them. 26 Vide H. Dh. vol. II, pp. 122-123 for discussion on the question whether brāhmaṇas could become soldiers. In Udyoga parva 96.7 (cr. ed. chap. 94 ) it is said that king Dambhod bhava every day asked in the morning whether there was any śūdra, vaisya, ksatriya or brahmana equal or superior to him in armed conflict. That shows that soldiers of castes other than kşatriyas were not unheard of in the Epic age. Kām. IV. ( 63, 65, 67 ) says that the hereditary army (pitr-paitāmaha) should consist mostly of ksatriyas. In the Maliya copperplate of Mahārāja Dharasena II ( 252 Valabhi samvat i. e. 571-72 A. D.) Bhațārka, the founder of the Valabhi dynasty, is said to have secured the kingdom with the help of maula, bhsta, mitra and śreội troops (Gupta Inscriptions p. 165 ). Sukra (II. 137-139 ) says that the soldiers may be südras, kşatriyas, vaisyas, mlecchas or of mixed castes, provided they are brave, restrained, well-built, devoted to their master and their dharma, and hate the enemy. Santi (101. 3-5) describes in what respects soldiers from Gandhāra, Sindhu and other countries and Yavana and Deccan soldiers excel, remarks that brave and strong men are to be found everywhere (verse 6 ) and that men from the border (i. e. bhillas and kaivartas accord ing to Nilakaptha ) are desperate fighters, would never run away from battle and so should be preferred for enlistment in the army (verse 19). The Yasastilaka III (pp. 461-467) describes the characteristics of Northern Indian (auttarāpatha), Deccan (dākşiņātya), Dramila (South Indian), Tirhut (Taira bhukta) and Gurjara soldiers. An army was said to be composed of four parts, viz. elephants, horses, chariots and foot-soldiers (caturanga bala). Kām. XVIII. 24 says that bala is sixfeld, viz. the four sections of infantry, cavalry, chariots and elephants together with mantra (line of policy) and kośa (treasury). In Sānti. 103. 38 the army is said to have six angas (the well known four plus kośa and roads for traffic). According to Kautilya (II. %, VII. 11) and Kām. XIX, 62 the destruction of

the enemy's forces and victory depended on elephants.286 Santi parva (100. 24) says that an army in which the infantry pre dominates remains firm and that cavalry and chariots are all right when there is no rain. Sānti (59. 41-42) enumerates eight elements of the army viz. the well-known four (elephants etc.), visti (labourers or porters who gave free labour and were only fed but were paid no wages ), boats, spies, and guides (dešika). 267 Vide Santi 121. 44 also. In the Mahābhārata elephants do not, except in rare cases, play any role in the fighting that went on, while chariots and the other arms of an army are described everywhere. In the Virātaparva ( 65. 6) Vikarna was seated on an elephant when he attacked Arjuna; Bhişmaparva 20.7 refers to Duryodhana as riding an elephant and (95. 32-33) Bhagadatta is described as seated on an elephant when he attacked Bhima. In this respect the Epic carries on the vedic tradition. Megasthenes (Fragment 1 p. 30) notes that in ancient India elephants were trained for war and turned the scale of victory. Vast armies were kept by ancient kings and emperors. When Satrughna started against the demon Lavana he had an army of 4000 horses, 2000 chariots and 100 elephants with him (Rāmāyaṇa VII. 64. 2-4). In the Dasakumāracarita VIII the cynical jester Viharabhadra reminds his master that the latter had 10000 elephants, three lakhs of horse and numberless foot-soldiers (B. S. S. p. 133, of ed. of 1919).

Megasthenes (in Fragment XXVII p. 68) speaks of the camp of Sandrakottos (Candragupta Maurya) that had 400000 men, notes ( in Fragment LVI) that the king of Palibothra had in his pay a standing army of six lakhs of foot-soldiers, 30000 cavalry and 9000 elephants (p. 141, McCrindle ), that the king of Horatae (Surāştra ) had 150000 foot-soldiers, 5000 cavalry and 1600 elephants (ibid p. 150 ) and that even the Pāudyan kingdom ruled by women had 150000 foot and 500 elephants (ibid. p. 147). Vide Beal's 'Buddhist Records &c.' vol. I. p. 213 for the armies collected by Harga in his march against the murderer of his elder brother (viz. 5000 elephants, 2000 horse and 50000 foot-soldiers ) and the vast armies that he had after six years of conquest viz. 60000 elephants and 100000 cavalry. In the Asvamedhikarparya ( 60. 14-20 ) it is narrated that when Drona assunied the post of commander-in-chief the Kaurava army had been reduced to 9 akşuuhinis from eleven, that only five were left when Karna became Senāpati and the Pandavas had then only three left and under Salya's command there were only three akşauhiņis and the Pandavas could oppose to him only one. In reply to a question from Dhrtarāstra Yudhisthira states that in the great war the total number of warriors killed in battle came to the colossal figure of 1660020006 ( Striparva 26. 9).268 The Udyogaparva gives ( 155, 24-26 ) the following table for an akşauhiņi : 500 elephants, 500 chariots, 1500 cavalry and 2500 foot-soldiers constituted an army called senā, 10 senās= prtanā, 10 prianās=vāhini, 10 vāhinis=dhvajini, 10 dhvajinis = cumū and 10 camūs=aksauhiņi. The Kauravas had eleven akşauhinis and the Pandavas had 7. If we take the table in Adi 2. 19-22 one akşauhini contained 21870 elephants, the sanie number of chariots, 65610 horses and 109350 foot-soldiers. 264 But if the other tables be followed then the numbers may be much larger still. Another table furnished by Udyogaparva. 155. 28-29 is : 55 men constituted patti, 3 pattis senāmukha or gulma, 3 gulmas = gana and there were ayutas (10 thousands ) of gañas in the army of the Kauravas.

differs from both tables in some respects. The Udyogaparva 155, 22 further notes that each horseman was surrounded by ten men attendants (narā daśa hayaścāsan pādarakşāḥ samantataḥ). Though throughout the centuries the infantry was theoretically and in practice more numerous than cavalry, not much importance seems to have been attached to them as compared with chariots or horsemen. The lexicon called Vaijayanti says that patti consists of three horses, five foot soldiers, one chariot and one elephant, that three pattis are equal to senāmukha and that senāmukha, gulma, gana, vābini, pitanā, camũ, anikini represent each three times as many as the preceding one and that 10 anikinis are equal to an akşauhiņi, The Nitiprakāśikā 870 gives a table of groups from patti to akşauhini and remarks that each of these groups had in turn numerous supporting men e. g. each elephant was followed by a hundred horsemen and a thousand foot-soldiers and each horse man was supported by a thousand foot-soldiers ( VII. 3-10 ). Manu VII. 192 refers to battles on water also. From references in the Mahābhārata it appears that chariots had only two wheels. Vide Bhişma 98. 47, Dronaparva 154. 3, Salya 16. 24 (Śaineyo dakşiņam cakram Dhrstadyumnas-tathottaram). Two noted warriors were told off to guard the two wheels of the chariot of the principal commanders and are called 'cakra-rakşau' ( vide Bhisma 54. 76, 108. 5, Drona 91, 36, Karpa 11, 31, 34, 44). Chariots of great warriors were drawn by four horses e. g. Adi. 198. 15, Udyoga 48. 50, Droņa 145. 81. Udyoga 83. 15-21 describe the chariot of Krspa and Udyoga 140. 21 states that chariots had small tinkling bells attached to them and also screens of tiger-skin. The Rg. contains very graphic descriptions of chariots. Chariots were generally drawn by two horses in the vedic age (Rg. V. 30. I, V. 36.5, VI. 23. 1) and had two wheels, but the chariot of the. Aśvins is described as having three wheels (Rg. I. 118. 2, I. 157. 3, X. 41. 1). Ghatotkaca, however, had eight wheels to his chariot (Droņa 156. 61, 175. 13). The Sukranitisāra (II. 140-148) mentions another method of grouping the army. Five or six foot-soldiers made a patti over which there

was an officer called puttipa, over 30 pattipālas there was the gaulmika, over 100 gaulmikas was the officer called satanika, who had as his assistants an officer called anušatika, a senānı and a lekhaka (scribe ); the officer over twenty elephants or horses was called nāyaka ( compare modern "naik"). Each of these officers should have a distinctive badge indicative of their position. Ayodhyā 100. 32 ( =Sabhā 5. 48) asks: 'I hope you give at the proper time pay and rations to your soldiers according to their deserts and do not delay payment'. Both Nār. (sambhūya-22) and Br. state that among persons who work for hire the best is the soldier. The Mānasollaga ( II. 6. 566-569 p. 80) describes that the chiefs of the hereditary army should always be honoured by the king with presents of jewels, ornaments, costly clothes and sweet words and sumptuous provision for their maintenance should be made by bestowing on them a village, or two or more villages and heaps of gold, while hired soldiers should be paid every day or every month or once in three, four or six months or once in a year according to the needs of the king. Megasthenes (Frag ment XXXIV p. 88 ) describes the organization of the Indian army: 'A third governing body directs military affairs, of which there were six divisions with five members to each. One co-operates with the admiral of the fleet, another with the superintendent of bullock trains, the third division has charge of foot-soldiers, the fourth of horses, the fifth of war chariots and the sixth of elephants. In medieval times chariots appear to have become obsolete. In the graphic descriptions of armies contained in the Harşacarita ( particularly in the 7th ucchvāsa ) war chariots are conspicuous by their absence. The Mahābhārata often speaks of horses from the countries to the north-west of India as the best; vide Sabhā 53. 5 (for Kamboja and Gāndhāra horses ), Udyoga 86. 6 (horses from 

Balhi), Drona 125. 25 and Sauptika 13.2 (Kamboja horses). The Harşacarita II speaks of the best horses as coming from Vanāyu, Aratta, Kamboja, Sindhudesa and Pārasika. Sukra lays down certain practical rules about the army (IV, 7. 379-390). He says that the soldiers should be encamped outside the town or village but not far from it, that no money-lending should be allowed between the soldiers and the village people, that the king should open separate shops for goods required by soldiers, that no army should be encamped at one place for more than a year, that soldiers should not enter the village without the king's permission, that receipts should be taken from soldiers

for payments made to them and they should be furnished with a writing about their pay. Some of these rules are very old. The Udyogaparva 471 37. 30 mentions among persons with whom no contractual transactions should be entered into, the king, the king's servants and soldiers. 

The Artbaśāstra contains an elaborate discussion (in IX. 1-7 and X, 1-6) about the organization of the king's army, the proper time and place for starting on an invasion, internal and external troubles and calamities and measures against them, means of dealing with traitors and enemies, religious remedies (worshipping gods and falling at the feet of brāhmaṇas, magical rites based upon the Atharvaveda) against misfortunes like fire and flood, epidemics, famine &c., encampinent ( skandhāvāra ) of armies, treacherous and strategic fighting, proper battle grounds, encouragement to one's own army, free labourers and their work, different arrangements or formations (vyūhas ) of armies. Considerations of space prevent any treatment of these matters. But a few notable points will be set out here. A king may invade his enemy's country either in Mārgasirşa ( when the crops sown in the rains are ready ) or in Caitra or when the enemy is suffering from some calamity. Sānti (100. 10-11 ) says the same thing. Internal trouble arises when any minister, purohita, senāpati or the crown prince is angry or dissatisfied with the king, who should get rid of such trouble by giving up his own fault or by pointing out the danger arising from an enemy. If the crown prince causes trouble he should be kept in confinement or killed, if there is another son of good character, The trouble caused by a provincial Governor or the officer in charge of boundaries (antapāla), the chief of wild tribes or a conquered king is termed external. The king should meet it by setting up one against the other. The encampment of an army is to be made on a site declared to be the best according to the science of buildings and measured by the nāyaka ( the chief of the army), carpenter and astrologer, the encampment being circular, square or rectangular and having four gates, six roads and nine divisions. Disputes, drinking, holding merry gather ings ( samāja ) and gambling should be prohibited in the camp and the system of passes should be enforced (X. 1). Vanaparva ( 15. 14, 19 ) also refers to the system of passes and the faot that

dancers and musicians were driven away, when Dvārakā was besieged by sālva. From Udyoga 151. 58 (cr. ed. 149.53), 195. 12-19 (cr. ed. 196. 12-19) it appears that markets, prosti tutes, conveyances, oxen, machines, arms and physicians accompanied an army and that the camp (senānivesa or skandhāvāra) of Duryodhana looked like the capital itself and was five yojanas in extent. Physicians with surgical instruments, blunt instruments (like tweezers ), medicines, curative oils and handages in their hands and women ( nurses ) looking after the food and drink of the army should stand behind the soldiers uttering encouraging words 278 (Kaut X. 3). The Bhişmaparva 120.55 also states that doctors well-versed in extraoting splinters or arrow-heads (froni the body ) approached with their Burgical instruments to extract the darts from Bhişma's body. The duties of the labourers (vişti) were to examine the camp, roads, bridges, wells, and river ghats, to carry machines, weapons, armour, utensils, fodder, to remove from the battle-field wounded men along with their weapons and armour.278 Each commander had some distinguishing device as his banner e. g. Bhisma had a golden tāla tree as his standard (Bhişmaparva VI. 17. 18, tālena mahatā Bhiệmah pañcatāreņa ketunā). In X. 6 Kautilya speaks of several formations (vyūhas) called danda, bhoga; mandala, aśanihata and the subdivisions such as gomūtrikā, makara &c. In Kām, XVIII. 48-49, XIX. 40 ff., Manu VII. 187–191, Nitiprakāśikā, chap. 6 and in the Mahābhārata many vyūhas are described. Vanaparva (285. 6-7) refers to Rāvaşa's arrangement of his army according to the rules of Usanas and of Rama's army according to Bārhaspatya rules. The Asrama vāsikaparva 7. 15 refers to the formations called Sakata, Padma and Vajra described in the work of Uśanas. Kautilya X. 6 also refers to Aušanasa and Bārhaspatya arrangements of armies. Drona 75, 27, 87, 22-24, Karpaparva 11. 14 and 28 mention certain vyūbas like Makara, Sakata &c. Vide also Manasollasa II. 20 verses 1170-1181 pp. 134-135, Agnipurāna 242. 7-8 and 42-73 for vyühas.

High ideals in warfare 

209 

Mahabharata holds up a high ideal. The Bhismaparva ar4 21. 10 remarks that conquerors do not secure victory so much by their armies and prowess as by truthfulness, freedom from cruelty, the observance of dharma and energetic actions. The Santi parva ( 95. 17-18) states that it is better to die while fighting according to the rules of dharma rather than obtain a victory by wicked actions. 

____ In the Bhismaparva (I. 27-32) certain rules of war agreed upon between the Kauravas and the Pandavas are set out, such as one should fight only with one similarly equipped (i. e. a foot soldier with a foot-soldier and so on), one should not kill a soldier who is already in combat with another, or who has turned back from fight or is without armour. Ap. Dh. S. II. 5. 10. 12, Gaut. x. 17-18, Yaj. I. 326, Manu VII. 90-93, Santi 95.7-14,96.3, Santi 98. 48-49,297.4, Dronaparva 143.8, Karna90.111-113, Sauptika 5. 11-12, 6. 21-23, Sankha (quoted by the Mit. on Yaj. I. 326), Baud. Dh. S.

Some of these ( that will bear comparison with the conventions of the Geneva and Hague Conferences) are set out here. Gaut. (X. 17-18 ) 875 states: 'no sin is committed by injuring or slaying men in battle excepting him who has lost his horse, charioteer or weapons, him who joins his hands ( in supplication for life ), whose hair are dishevelled (in flying), who turns away from the field, who sits down, who climbs an eminence or a tree (in flight), except envoys or messengers, except him who declares himself to be a cow or a brahmana'. Vrddha-Harita. VII. 216 exempts spectators. Manu (VII.90-93) declares "one should not fight with treacherous

(or concealed ) weapons, or with barbed or poisoned weapong or with weapons the points of which are blazing with fire. Let a fighter not strike one who has climbed on an eminence, nor a eunuch, nor one who joins the palms of his hand ( ip supplica tion), nor one with flying hair ( in flight), nor one who sits down or says 'I am thine', nor one who is asleep, nor one who has lost armour, nor one who is naked or disarmed, nor one who is merely looking on without taking part in the fight, nor one who is fighting with another foe, nor one whose weapons are broken, nor one who is afflicted with sorrow, nor one seriously wounded, nor one who is in fear, nor one who has turned to flee.'' Sankha adds that a soldier should not kill another while the latter is drinking water or taking his meals or is taking off his shoes, nor should one kill a woman, a female elephant, nor a charioteer, nor a bard nor a brāhmaņa nor should one who is not a king (or noble) kill one who is a king. Baud. Dh. S.I. 10. 10 forbids the use of poisoned or barbed arrows ( karnin). Santi 95. 11 also does the same. Sānti ( 95. 13-14 ) enjoins that even an enemy soldier, when wounded, should be treated with medicine and allowed to go when his wounds are healed, 176 Šānti adds that a soldier should not kill boys or old men nor from behind nor one who holds a blade of grass in his mouth (as a mark of submission). These rules, though probably ideal and not strictly followed in every case, are far more humane as compared with the practice in modern warfare when non combatants are killed from the air even at night without warn ing. In ancient times non-combatants went generally un molested, to which Megasthenes bears testimony when he says (Frag. I. p. 32 ) Tillers of the soil even when battle is raging in the neighbourhood are undisturbed by any sense of danger, for the combatants allow those engaged in husbandry to remain quite unmolested,' Manu VII. 32 allows a king to harass his enemy's country, but Medbātithi on VII. 32 asks the invader to save his enemy's people if possible (particularly brābmapas). The rule in gudāyuddha (fight with maces or clubs ) was that no blow was to be struck below the navel ( Salyaparva 60. 6). But this rule was violated by Bhima when he struck Duryodbana on the thigh with his mace. Duryodhana recounts ( in Salya 61 . all the bad deeds of Krspa and the Pāndavas and the only reply that Krsna makes is that he too was guilty of

numerous breachey of morality and the chivalrous rules of war ( such as the slaying of Abhimanyu by many engaging him at one time ). The general rule was that fighting ceased when the sun went down ( Bhisma 49. 52-53 ). But in Dronaparva 154 and 163. 16 ff. we have a description of night battles and it is provided that chariots, elephants and horses should carry lamps. 

It has already been shown how it was the duty of a ksatriya and of every soldier to fight and die in battle rather than run away. A fighting spirit was inculcated by holding out several rewards. One was the acquisition of booty and territory (Gaut. X. 41, Manu VII. 206, Bhagavadgita II. 37); others were the satisfaction of having done one's duty as a kşatriya (Gita II. 31-33), honour and fame (Gita II. 34-35), heaven and other-worldly rewards (Yāj. I. 324, Manu VII. 88-89), protection of brāhmaṇas (Ap. Dh. S. II. 10. 26. 2-3). Visņu Dh. S. III. 44-46 have already been quoted above (p. 58). The Śānti (98. 40-41) states that a soldier who runs away from the field falls into Hell. Yāj. (I. 324-325) declares that those who, while fighting with weapons that are not treacherous (poisoned &c.) for the sake of the land (of their master or of the enemy) die in battle without turning back from it go to heaven like yogins, that each step of those who do not flee even when their comrades have been killed is equal to a solemn sacrifice (like the Asyamedha); the king (the master) takes away all the merit of thoge who run away from the battlefield and are then killed. Manu VII. 95 contains the same idea. These remarks were applicable not only to ksatriya soldiers, but to soldiers of all castes who maintained themselves by following the pro fession of arms. Vide Rājanītiprakāśa p. 407. Parāsara (III. 31) and Bṛhat-Parāśara X. p. 281 remark that a valiant soldier who does not seek mercy though surrounded by many enemies and falls fighting attains imperishable worlds and that when he reaches heaven divine damsels run after him to choose him as their Lord ( III. 34-35).

one of the two quoted by Kaut. (X.3) when soldiers are to be urged on to fight. Kautilya (in X. 3) advises that the king him. self and his mantrin and purohita should urge on his soldiers by quoting Vedic and classical Sanskrit passages about the rewards waiting for those who fall fighting for their master and the religious punishments for those who run away. Astrologers should infuse spirit into their side by asserting that the heavenly aspects favour their side. The day before the battle the king should observe a fast, offer oblations into fire to the accom paniment of Atharvaveda mantras and cause benedictory texts to be repeated that refer to victory. Bards should recite lays describing heaven as the reward for the brave and hell for the timid and extol the caste, guild, family, deeds and character of the soldiers. The assistants of the purohita should declare that they have practised witchcraft against the enemy. The commander in-chief and the officers under him should address the army as follows:-'a hundred thousand (panas) will be the reward for him who kills the enemy king, fifty thousand for him who kills the commander-in-chief or the crown prince, .......... a hundred for slaying the officer of the patti (a battalion), twenty for bringing the head (of a common soldier) and twice the pay and the booty seized by each to all soldiers'. Kām. (XIX. 18-21) says that the king should give the rewards (promised as in Kaut.) to the soldiers after they succeed in the exploits men tioned. Vide also Mānasollāsa II. 20 verses 1163–1167 (pp. 133 134) for similar promises. Gaut. (X. 20-23) prescribes that whatever wealth is acquired by a soldier by bis individual effort should be given to him by the king, but the horse or elephant caught by a soldier goes to the king, that if many soldiers by a joint effort obtain some valuable plunder the king should choose and retain the best for himself and the rest should be divided among the soldiers according to their services in the battle. Vide Manu VII. 96-97 (which allow even & chariot, horse or elephant to be retained as booty by the soldier and everything else including female slaves, except jewels, gold and silver), Kām. XIX. 278 21-22, Sukra IV, 7. 372. 

A treatise will be required to deal with the weapons of war from ancient times. Even in the Rgveda several weapons are mentioned e. g. rsti (Rg. V. 52.6, V. 57.2 and 6 on the shoulders

of the Maruts), arrows (V. 57,2, VI. 75. 17), quivers (V. 57. 2), the ankusa (of Indra in VIII. 17. 10, X. 44. 9), parašu (X. 28.8), kspāņa (probably a dagger, in X. 22. 10), vajra made of ayas (X. 48.3, X. 113.5). Atharvaveda IV, 6.6. refers to poisoned arrows. In the Atharvaveda 879 I. 16.% and 4 reference is made to lead as destroying sorcerers and it is said “if you kill our cow or horse or man we shall pierce you with lead so that you will cease to kill our strong men'. In Tai. S. I. 5.7.6 it is said €80 that when a samidh is offered into fire with the mantra 'indhānās-tvā satam himāḥ' the sacrificer discharges against his enemy the sataghni ( weapon killing a hundred) which acts like vajra itself'. Dr. Oppert in his Introduction to the Nitiprakāsika pp. 10-13 relies on these and other passages for holding that the ancient Indians knew fire-arms and that Atharvaveda I. 16.4 refers to leaden balls discharged from cylinders. Vide Dr. Oppert's work on the 'weapons, army organisation and political maxims of the ancient Hindus (1880), where he describes several weapons and holds that gunpowder was known in India long before the 13th century A. D. Mr. G. T. Date's 'Art of war in Ancient India' (London 1929), Dr. P. C. Chakravarti's work (1941, Dacca) and Prof. Dikshitar's book on the same subject may be consulted for details. The numerous weapons mentioned in the Mahabharata (e. g. Udyoga 155. 3-9) also are passed over here. Vide Hop. king' paper in J. A. O. S. Vol. XIII pp. 269-303 for detailed descriptions. The Allahabad Stone Pillar Inscription of Samu dragupta (middle of 4th century A. D.) contains a long list of we apons (C I I. III pp. 6–7).2804 One important question is whether gunpowder and fire-arms were known to our ancient and medieval works. Sukra refers to gunpowder called agnicūrna in II. 93,196, IV. 7. 203, guns (IV. 7. 209-211 ) and gives the formula of gunpowder in IV. 7. 201 (viz. the mixing of five palas of salt petre, one pala of sulphur and one pala of coal powder). The Sukranitisāra is comparatively a late work and was probably

written in the L3th or 14th century when cannon came to be used in Europe for the first time. Both in the Rāmāyaṇa and the Mahābhārata the word sataghni ( killing a hundred people ) occurs frequently. In the Yuddhakānda 281 3. 13 it is stated that at the gates of Lankā hundreds of iron sataghnis, looking burnished, sharp and terrible, bad been arranged by the demons, In a poetic description of Lanka in the Sundarakānda chap. 2, it is said that sataghnis and sūlas were like the hair on the head of Lankā (verse 21). In the Vanaparva 15 there is a fine description of Dvāravatl (Dvārka) besieged by Śālva, in which it is said that the capital had numerous towers and turrets, machines, tomaras, askusas, sataghnis &c. In Adi. 207. 34, Vanaparva 169. 16, 284.5, 290, 24, Drona 156, 70, Karna 11. 8, Salya 45. 110 the sataghni is Inentioned, but it is impossible to find from these what exactly it was like. From Vanaparva 284. 31 it appears that the sataghnis were discharged with force by the hands and had wheels and round balls or stones in it. In Drona 179. 46 it is said that the sataghni employed by Ghatotkaca had wheels and killed four horses at once. In Droņa 199. 19 sataghnis are said to have two or four wheels. In Vanaparva 282 284. 4 it is said that the powder of sarjarasa ( resin from Sal tree ) had been collected. In the Harivamsa ( Bhavisyaparva 44. 20 ), among the weapons hurled at Narasimha by Hiraṇyakaśipu were blazing sataghnis (sataghnibhiśca diptabhir-daņdairapi sudāruņaih). In Rāmāyaṇa VII. 32. 44 we are told that at the tip of the weapon called musala ( club) blazed forth fire like a bunch of Asoka flowers. The Sundarakānda couples together sataghni and musala ( 4, 18). It looks probable that resinous powder was used in some cylindrical contrivance (or rockets) mounted on wheels and capable of throwing stones. But gunpowder appears not to have been used. There is no description of smoke due to sataghnis. Hopkins (J. A. O. S. XIII pp. 299-303 ) holds that gunpowder and fire-arms were unknown to the great Epic and in the present state of our knowledge this view seems to be correct. 

The Nitiprakāśikā (chapters %-5) names and describes numerous weapons divided into four classos viz. mukta ( thrown

or discharged such as arrows), amukta (not thrown such as swords ), muktamukta (thrown and not thrown, such as astras which after discharge can be taken back) and mantramukta (astras which cannot be taken back ). The Agnipurana ( 249 252 ) and the Vişnudharmottara ( II 178-182) give a summary of the Dhanurveda (both agreeing almost word for word, but the latter containing more verses than the former ) and speak of five kinds of weapons viz. yantramukta ( discharged from a machine, a sling, bow &c. ), pāņimukta ( thrown with the hand such as a stone or tomara ), muktā mukta (like a prāga ), amukta (sword) and niyuddha or bahuyuddha ( wrestling). The science of astras was of a supernatural kind. In the epics and purānas, the great heroes are said to have learnt astravidyā either from a teacher or from their father or by practising austerities and sometimes (as in the case of Kuģa and Lava) certain astras pass to the son by the mere fact of his birth and the wish of his father. Whether the Dhanurveda often referred to in the epics had consign ed this science of astras to writing and could have enabled a reader to possess the miraculous powers attributed to astras is more than a modern can say. The Agnipurāņa (chap. 134-135) contains magical incantations for victory in war and conquest of the worlds. The Parašurāmapratāpa (Rājavallabhakānda folios 9-12 ) contains numerous mantras apd yantras and incanta tions derived from Tantra works like the Brahmayamala. 

The Mahabharata is careful to point out that an army consti tutes the most inferior kind of bala (power). Udyogaparva (37. 59-55 ) states that bala is of five kinds viz. brute force (bahubala ), that due to the acquisition of ministers ( amatya. lābha ), that derived from wealth ( dhanalābha ), that from noble descent (abhijātubala) and the power of wisdom (prajñābala), which last is the best of all. These are quoted by the Budhabhūgana p. 79. In Santi. 134. 8 it is said 883 that there is nothing that the strong cannot accomplish and that whatever the strong do is pure. In another place it is said ' everything is wholesome to the powerful'( Aśramavāsi 30. 24). In Adi 175.45 a warrior's power is scorned and the power of the spiritual merit of brāhmaṇas is extolled as the real power.

CHAPTER IX SUHRT OR MITRA (ALLY OR FRIEND). 

Manu inculcates the necessity of making friends in VII. 208 and cites the qualities of a good friend (for. a king) 'a king does not prosper by the acquisition of gold and land so much as by securing a firm friend who would be powerful in future, though he may be of depleted resources at the time. That friend, though a weak one, is commended, who is righteous, grateful, whose subjects (or ministers) are contented, who is attached and who pursues (to the end) work undertaken'. According to Manu VII. 206 land, gold and ally are the three fruits of royal endeavour or policy. Yāj I. 352 is similar to Manu VII. 208. In VII. 9 Kautilya in opposition to the above holds that the acquisition of land is better than that of gold and friend and the acquisition of gold is superior to that of a friend284. The Mahā. bharata (Santi 138.110) states 'no one is the friend or enemy of any one else; friends or enemies are made by wealth (or objects pursued by a person):285 Kām. VIII. 52 says the same. Sukra. (IV. 1.8-10) opines' in the case of a brave, energetic, strong and politic king all others, though outwardly friendly, secretly cherish enmity to bim and only wait for (the proper) time to strike). There is no wonder in this. Are they not themselves greedy of conquering territories? A king has no friend and he is the friend of none'. Santi (80. 3) says286 that a friend is of four kinds, one who has the same goal, one who comes for protec tion or security, one who is naturally go and one who is acqui. red. Karnaparva 88. 28 gives the four kinds somewhat diffe rently viz. natural (sahaja), acquired by conciliatory words,

won by wealth and one drawn by one's prowess. Kām. (IV. 74) says that a mitra is of four kinds viz. by birth (such as one's father's father, mother &c.), made by relationship (i. e. marriage), hereditary (one's father's friend), one who is saved from calamities.287 According to Kām. (IV.75-76) the qualities of a friendly king are purity (of heart), liberality, bravery, sharing happiness and sorrow, affection, vigilance (to carry out one's friend's object), truth; and briefly the characteristic of a true friend is devotion to the objects desired by his friend. The purpose for which & friend is made is to secure one of the three purusārthas, dharma, artha and kāma (Kām. IV. 72). 

This subject of making friends leads on to the well-known theory of mandala i. e, of inter-state relationship. Kaut. VI. 2 and VII, Manu VII. 154-211, Aśramyāsiparva 6-7, Yāj. I. 345 348, Kam. VIII-XI, Agnipurāņa 233 and 240, Vişnudharmottara II. 145-150, Nitivākyāmsta pp. 317-343, Rājanitiprakāśa pp. 316 330, Nitimayükha pp. 44-46 deal with this theory of mandala and the six gurus at great length. As the Kauțiliya is probably the earliest of these and contains the most elaborate treatment of the subject, a brief outline from it is presented here. The Nitivākyāmsta (pp. 311-313) copies the very words of Kautilya. 

The yogakşema (welfare) of a State springs from peace (sama) and exertion (vyāyāma). The latter achieves the com pletion of works undertaken, while śama brings about the undis turbed enjoyment of the fruits of undertakings. The (proper) employment of the six gunas ( sandhi &c.) is the source of sama and vyāyāma. What results (uday) from these six guņas is either deterioration, stagnation or progress. Udaya depends upon human and divine causes which together govern the world. The human ones are naya and apunaya. Human causes are seen (anticipated) and can be operated (by men). Naya (good policy) is that out of the human causes from which results yogakşema (welfare); apanaya (impolitic way) is that which produces loss (or an unfavourable state). In VI. 1 (last verbe) Kautilya says that a king who understands naya and is endowed with the ātmagunas and all the elements of the State will conquer the whole world, though originally he may have a small king dom. The mandala theory is set out in relation to a king who

is called vijigişu ( the ambitious ruler or conqueror). Kām. VIII 6 defines 288 vijigişu as a king who aspires to extend his terri tories, who is possessed of all the seven elements of sovereignty. who has great energy and who makes great efforts. In verses 7-11 he mentions at length his qualities. All our works place before kings this ideal of conquest, domination or self-aggran dizement at the expense of one's weak neighbours. A vijigişu is a king who is endowed with good qualities (called ātmasampat on p. 45 above) and with the several elements of the State and who is the fountain of policy (naya), i.e. who has a definite good policy to pursue. An ari (actual or potential enemy) is a king or kings who are the immediate neighbours on the circum ference of the kingdom of the vijigişu. From this it follows that ari may comprehend one king, two kings or more who are the immediate neighbours of the vijigişu. But it should be remembered as insisted upon by the Nitivākyāmrta289 (p. 321 that there is no inflexible rule that the immediate neighbour is an enemy and that the king whose dominion is beyond the imme diate neighbour will be a friend. Contiguity or distance is not necessarily the cause of friendship or enmity, but rather it is the purpose (or object) that makes friends or enemies. All that is meant is that the immediate neighbour is most likely to be an ari (a real or potential enemy). A mitra (friend of the vijigisu) is he who is separated (from the vijigişu) by the intervention of the kingdom of the ari. A satru is a neighbouring ruler posses sed of the characteristics of an enemy 290 (detailed in Kaut. VI. 1). The yātavya (to be attacked or invaded by the vijigişu) is an ari who is involved in difficulties. From this it is clear that in the terminology of Kautilya ari is a generic expression including actual and potential enemies who will generally be on the borders of the kingdom of the vijigişu. A satru is an ari who invites attack or destruction or harassment or reduction. That enemy who is plunged in vices or calamities may be

attacked and is then called yātavya 291 ; one who has no support or has only a weak support is to be extirpated; an enemy who is the opposite of this last (ie. who has a support or strong support) is to be either harassed or to be reduced. Support (asraya) means a strong fort or a good friend (Kām. VIII. 60). So that a satru is of four sorts (yātavya, ucchedya, pidanlya, karsaniya). Harassment is caused to him who is without mantra and a strong army, while one who is strong in mantra and army is to be rendered weak in these respects. Both a satru or a mitra are of three kinds, sahaja, krtrima and prākrta. A sahaja (natural) friend is one' who is related through one's parents (such as maternal or paternal aunt's son); one who is resorted to for wealth or safety is kştrima (acquired) i. e. one who has obliged the vijigişu or has been under his obligations; and the king who is next to the neighbour (i. e. who is separated from the vijigişu by the intervention of the neighbour king) is prāksta (i. e. because he is a praksti, an element in the mandala theory ). A sahaja enemy is one who is born of the same family (such as a step-brother), a křirimu is one who is antagonistic or incites antagonists (i. e. one who has caused harm to or who has been harmed by the vijigişu), while the immediate neighbour is a prūksta enemy. The Mit. on Yāj. I. 345 very concisely but lucidly explains all these and the four kinds of satru. The Vişnudharmottara (II. 145. 15-16) and the Agnipurāna (233. 21–22) say that in their opinion the prāksta is really krtrima. Kām. VIII. 56 also speaks of only two, sahaja and krtrima, Although it is possible that the vijigişu's realm is surrounded by many kings, the one who is taken for discussion is the enemy and is to be regarded as in front (purastāt ) of the vijigişu. Therefore in front of the vijigisu come in order the ari ( imme diate neighbour ), then the mitra ( whose domain is next after that of the ari), then the arimitra (the friend of the enemy who will be immediately after the mitra of the vijigisu and so will be the enemy of the mitra), then comes the mitra mitra ( friend of the friend of the vijigişu) and then arimitra mitra (ally of the enemy's friend ).

to be in front of the vijigişu, the ruler of the territory in the opposite direction is said to be in the rear of the vijigisu (pascat) and is called pārşnigrāha 292 (lit. one who may Beize or attack the heels). He is really an enemy but this special term is applied to him and he causes trouble in the realm of the vijigisu when the latter has started on an invasion or is about to start on one. The king who is the ruler of the country beyond the pārşnigrāha is called ākranda (lit. one for whose help a cry is or may be raised by the vijigisu ). He would ordinarily be a friend being separated from the vijigişu by the realm of the pārsnigrāha. The friend of the pārenigrāha ( who would be immediately next after the akranda ) is called pārşpigrāhāsāra and the friend of the ākranda who would be beyond the pārşı nigrāhāsāra is called akrandāsāra. A madhyama 2% king is one whose realm is close to ( is on the border of) that of the vijigişu and that of the ari ( the immediate enemy in front) and who is capable of helping (or favouring ) both of them whether both are combined in alliance or not and who is capable of resisting either of them individually when the two are not in combina tion. An udasina king is generally defined as one whose territory is beyond or outside of the sphere of the realms of the vijigişu, his enemy in front and the madhyama, who is very strong on account of his elements of sovereignty, is capable of helping the above three kings whether they be in combination or not and who is capable of resisting any of the three when they are not in combination. Kullūka on Manu. VII. 153 differs from this explanation i.e. the udāsina is a powerful king whose realm may be situated in front or in the rear or even at a distance from that of the vijigişu, but he is indifferent for some reason or other to the activities of the vijigişu. The Mit. on Yāj. I. 345 observes that the udāsina also is of three kinds and the prāksta udāsına is the overlord of the State that is separated from the central state (vijigişu) by two intervening States; the

neutral in the the pakyāmrta 

madhyama ( or madhyastha acc. to Nitivākyāmṛta p. 318 ) is the immediate neighbour of both the vijigisu and his enemy, but wants to remain neutral in the conflict of the two for some reason. It will have been noticed that the vijigişu, the enemy, the madhyama and the udāsina are independent catagories, while four out of the remaining eight others viz. mitra, mitramitra, akranda, ākrandāsāra can be grouped under vijigişu, while the other four viz, arimitra, arimitramitra, pārşpigrāha and pārşpi grāhāsāra may be grouped under ari. It is therefore that Manu (VII. 155-156 ) speaks of the four prakstis (vijigisu, satru, madhyama and udāsīna ) as the mūla (basis) of the mandala theory and Kām. VIII. 20 informs us that Maya declared that a mandala was constituted by these four. Kām. VIII. 86 gives it as his own opinion that mandala is constituted by mitra, udāsīnu and ripu (enemy) only 294 Kautilya says that the man dala is constituted as explained above by twelve prakstis. Uśa nas was of the same opinion (Kām. VIII. 22) and Kām. (VIII. 41) states that there were numerous views about the number of the elements of the mandala, but a mandala of twelve kings is quite clear and well-known among all people 295. Kām. (VII). 20-41) explains how by various combinations of the elements of the mandala with some elements of sovereignty (viz. minis ters, rāstra, durga, kośa, bala) different writers held that the mandala comprised 18, 26, 54, 72, 108 and other numbers of prakrtis. The Sarasvativilāga (pp. 37-41) shows how from different standpoints Ušanas himself argued that the mandala was constituted by one praksti, two, three, 10, 21, 108 and that other writers speak also of 4, 5, 6, 14, 18, 30, 36, 44, 60, 72 prakrtis. All these figures are due to the inveterate habit of scholastic minds to run an idea to the earth and to indulge in divisions and sub-divisions. Even Manu (VII. 157 ) states that combining each of the twelve members of mandala with the five elements of sovereignty from amātya onwards we get 60 which with the twelve 2% come to 72. It is to this that the

Dasakumāracarita (VIII. p. 144) refers when speaking of the tree of naya that it has 72 prakstis as its leaves (dvigaptatipra kstipatraḥ ... nayavanaspatiḥ). The central idea of the man dala was to keep a balance of power among a circle of States, some being friendly among themselves owing to their position and surroundings, while others would form an antagonistic group. Kaut. (VI. 2) also refers to this number 72, out of which twelve are constituted by kings (rājaprakstis ) and 60 ( five sovereignty elements of each of the twelve ) are styled ( dravyaprakrtis). The śāntiparva (59.70–71) also refers to a mandala of 12 kings and to the number 72. Vide N. N. Law's 'Studies in Ancient Hindu Polity' pp. 195-208 for elucidation of the theory of mandala. The theory of mandala has this element of truth in it that on a calculation of probabilities the kings who are the immediate neighbours of a ruler are likely to be his enemies (at least potential) and the kings that are beyond the immediate neighbours may make common cause with the central State taken for discourse in order to crush between them a hostile intermediate State. It suggests that diplomacy may take the lines indicated by position and probabilities. The diagram below will247 illustrate the idea. Manu (VII.177 and 180) declares that (state) policy consists briefly in this that a king must so arrange all things or means that the ally, the udāsina and the satru cannot harm him or become superior to him. Medhātithi (on Manu VII. 177 ) remarks that even an ally may become an enemy if his interest so requires (svārthagativasācca mitramapyarirbhavati). 

Kautilya2% relates the theory of mandala to the theory of Saktis (already referred to on p. 171) and the six-fold policy (sadgunya).

The six guņas 

223 

Everything secures success (i.e. his and his kingdom's happiness) according as the king is able to put forth each of the saktis to their utmost. The aspiring king taking into account his three Śaktis may employ the six gupas (methods of policy). The circle of the twelve States gives rise to the employment of the six methods. Differing from Vatavyādbi ( who said that there were only two methods, sandhi and vigraha ) and for once agreeing with the ācāryas, Kautilya accepts the position that there are six gunas and briefly defines them. The Sarasvativilāsa (p. 42 ) quotes a sutra of Gautama about the six guņas, which is not found in the printed text. 299 Kautilya defines the six as follows: Sandhi 300 means making an arrangement or agreement; vigraha means taking up a hostile attitude; āsana means an attitude of indifference; yāna means preparing ( for attacking one's enemy); samsraya means taking shelter (with another powerful king); draidhibhāva means making peace with one king and adopting a hostile attitude to another. He then states that a king who is less strong than his neighbour may make an agreement with him, one who is rising in power may take up a hostile attitude, whoever thinks' the hostile king cannot hurt me nor can I hurt him' may remain indifferent (or neutral) in his own State, one who is endowed with all advantages may march against the enemy, whoever is devoid of strength should seek the protection (of a powerful ruler), and one should resort to a two-fold attitude when one's object can be accomplished by a friend. Some other works give more exact definitions and also define dvaidhībhāva somewbat differently, viz. dvaidhibhāva is dividing one's army into two parts. Vide Vişoudharmottara301 II. 150.3-5 and Mit. on Yāj. I. 346. Some say that samsraya means seeking the protec tion of the udāsina or madhyama king. Kautilya (book VII) gives the most elaborate treatment of these six gunas and so do

Manu VII. 160 ff, Kām. IX-XVI, Vişnudharmottara II. 145-150, Agnipurāņa 240, Mānasollāsa pp. 94-116, Rājanitiprakāśa pp. 324-413. Only a few remarks are all that considerations of space allow. Manu (VII. 162-168 ) states that each of the gunas is of two sorts. Kām. LX. 2-18 and Agni 240 enumerate sixteen kinds of sandhis and Kām. defines them. His treatment is based on Kauț. VII. 3. Kauţ. (VII. 3 ) says that when a weak king is attacked by a powerful king who is the leader in a circle of States, the former should at once gubmit and sue for peace on condition of offering his army, treasury, himself and his territory. Then he says that sandhis made on condition of offering the army are of three kinds viz. ātmāmişcı (lit. offering himself as the proy, which involves the condition that the king himself with a fixed number of troops or with the flower of his army would presert himself when called), atmaraksana ( saving himself, where the condition is that the commander-in-chief or the crown prince would present himself with an army), adssta puruşa (lit. in which no person is definitely prescribed, where the agreement is that some one on the king's behalf or the king himself should march with the ariny to some place as required by the invader ). These sandhis are called dandopanata (lit. in which submission is made with the army ). Sandhis made on condition of offering the treasury (kosopanata ) are parikraya (lit. price, where by offering the treasury the other elements of rājya are kept free), upgraha ( where as much money is offered as can be carried on a man's shoulder ), kapāla (lit. broken half of a pot, where an immense amount of money has to be paid). Sandhis called lesopimata (submission with offer of territory ) are ūdista ( where a part of the realm is ceded and the rest saved from the invader), ucclunna ( where all the realm except the capital which has been deprived of all its wealth is offered ), apakraya where by offering the produce of the land the kingdoin is freed, paribhūşaņa where the agreement is to pay more than the produce of the land. Kām. adds some varieties and remarks (IX. 21-22 ) that upahāru (offering a present) is the only sandhi ( of which all the rest are varieties ) in his opinion, that only the maitra sandhi (alliance of friendship without the offer of land, money or anything else) does not come under upahāra 302 Kām. IX. 20 and Mānasollāsa ( II. 11.

pp. 94-95) speak of four sandhis, maitra, parasparopakūra ( agree ment to help each other ), sambandhaja (by offer of a princess in marriage ) and upahāra. An interesting example of a sandhi is furnished by the Lekhapañcāśikā which gives a form of treaty dated Monday, Full Moon of Vaišākta in saivat 1288 (1232 A, D.) between Yādava king Singhaņa of Devagiri who is styled mahārājādharaja and Lāvaṇyaprasāda (Lavapaprasāda) a Vaghela king who is styled rāņaka and mahāmandalesvara, whereby the high contracting parties agreed not to invade each other's possessions, to combine and oppose anyone else who invaded one of them. Vide Bom. G, Vol. I part 1 p. 200 based on Bhandar kar's Report on the search for Mss. 1882-83 pp. 38-40. Kām. IX. 23-26 and Agnipurāņa 240. 10-13 mention twenty kinds of persons with whom sandhi should not be made, Kam. (IX. 27-41 ) states the reasons why it should be so and in IX. 42-52 seven persons are enumerated with whom he recommends sandhi and gives reasons. A king should make sandhi even with one equal in strength ( not only with one who is more powerful ), since victory in battle is doubtful (Kām. IX. 59 ). 303 Kaut. uses a striking simile when he says that if one king comes in conflict with an equal they both will be destroyed in the same way as two unbaked earthen pots striking against one another. If a more powerful king rejects the proposal of a weaker king for sandhi, the latter should take up the attitude of offering his army or follow the course prescribed in book XII (ū baliyasam ). In VII. 12 when dealing with agreements between kings, about under takings to build forts or irrigational works or forests &c. Kaut. makes very interesting remarks about land routes being superior to water routes and about the route to the Deccan and the south being more profitable than the one leading to the Himā layas. 304 Kām. X. 15 ( = Agni 240. 19 ) says that vaira (hostile attitude ) is of five kinds viz. that of step-brothers, that due to land ( seizure of or encroachment on lands or houses ), due to woman ( carrying away one's wife or loving the same woman), due to words ( cutting speech ) and due to wrongs. Kām. X. 2-5

(Vol. 

( = Agni. 240. 20-24) enlarges upon the 16 ways in which vigraha ( hostility ) springs, such as seizing the kingdom, wife, districts, vehicles (horses, elephants) and wealth of another, pride, harassment of subjects &o. When a king feels that his own army is well-nourished and pleased, that his subjects are prosperous and contented and that the army and subjects of another are the opposite of this, then he may adopt a hostile attitude and when he feels sure that he will secure one of the three fruits of hostility (viz, land, ally and wealth-Kām. X. 26-28). Kaut. VII. 15 deals with the attitude and conduct of a conquered king who has offered to the conqueror his army ( dandopanata-urtta ), while VII 16 speaks of the conduct of the dandopanāyi (an aspiring king who wants to make by means of his army another king submit to him). Yūna means marching for invasion on the part of a vijigișu whose army and prowess are of the highest and whose subjects are contented on account of his good qualities (Kānı. XI. 1). The Matsya 240.2 and the Agnipurāņa ( 228. 1-2 ) add that when the enemy in the rear is overwhelmed by an ākranda, then the vijigişu should start on an invasion or when the enemy is plunged in calamities. But before actually invading the enemy who is yātavya ( chosen for attack ) an ambassador ( dūta ) should be sent ( Kām. XII. 1) to see whether the enemy will submit without fighting. That is, there was to be no war without negotiations and an ultimatum. In the Mahābhārata (Udyoga 83, 5-7) it is said that Krsna started as an envoy from the Pandavas to the Kauravas at the end of sarad (autumn) on the Revati nakşatra in the month of Kārtika ( verse 7, Kaumude mūsi revatyām saradante himāgame). In the Purāṇas and the medieval digests elaborate rules are laid down about the religious and propitiatory ceremonies before starting on an invasion. The Visnudharmottara II. 176 and Agnipurāna 236, 1-18 require that for seven days before starting on an invasion the king is to engage in the worship of and make offerings to various gods, first to Ganapati, then to all the guardians of the quarters, the planets, Asvins, Visņu and Siva and the images in the temples of his capital. Then he is to note what good and bad dreams he sees on those days in his sleep and judge accordingly. Vide Matsya 242, Agnipurāņa 229 for dreams portending good and evil. This prognostication of good fortune from dreams is very ancient. The Chandogya Up. (V.2.8-9) quotes a verse to the effect that when a man is engaged in the performance of solemn sacrifices for securing some object and sees a woman in a dream he should feel that his rite will be

crowned with reward, Similarly the Ait. 305 Ār. III. 2. 4 men tions the signs of approaching death, one of which is to see in a dream a dark person with black teeth. Both these passages are quoted by Sankara in his bhāsya on Vedāntasūtra II. 1. 14. The Visnudharmottara II. 132-144 (based on Garga), IL 164, Matsya 228-241, Agni 230-23% are concerned with the portents and omens in the heavens, in the sky and on the earth and rites ( śāntis ) meant to avert the evil prognostications from them. The Mānasollāsa II. 13 pp. 97-112 and Rājanitiprakāśa pp. 331 351 also deal with these and other astrological matters, which are passed over here, though some of them are very interesting 8. g. Vispudharmottara II. 135. 1 refers to the weeping and dancing of images. On the 6th day from the time the rites begin which is the day previous to the starting of the invasion the king undergoes a ceremonial bath for victory called jayā. bhişoki. This is described at great length in the Rājanitiprakāga pp. 351-395 quoting extensive passages from the Lingapurāņa. The ceremony of Jayasnānu resembles the coronation ceremony in many respects. The Matsyapurāņa 243. 15-16 and the Vişnudharmottara II. 163. 18-31 contain the same long list (with very slight variations) of articles, persons and animals the sight of which is auspicious when the king starts on an invasion and Matsya (243.2-14) contains another long list of inauspicious sights. A few of the auspicious ones are white flowers, jars full of water, cows, horses, elephants, fire in flames, a courtesan, durvā grags, gold, silver, copper, all gems, sword, umbrella, banner, corpse not accompanied by crying persons, fruits, the svastika sign. Among the inauspicious things and sights are dark grains, cotton, dried cowdung, fuel, jaggery, tonsured or naked man or man with dishevelled hair or wearing reddish robes, a lunatic, a cāndāla, a pregnant woman, broken pot, chaff, asbes, bones. The Mānasollāsa IL 13 verses 811-823 (pp. 102 103), Nitimayūkha pp. 58-59 also give long lists of inauspicious and auspicious sights or events. Matsya 213. 27 and Visnu dharmottara II. 163. 32 are both careful to add that all evil signs are counterbalanced by the confident (or joyous) frame of the mind, which is the highest sign of victory. 306 Gaut.

[Vol. 

(XI. 15-17) prescribes that the king should heed the advice of astrologers and of those who are adepts in averting the effects of portents and perform the rites indicated by them such as grahaśānti, rites on auspicious days and of svastyayana, rites of black magic against his enemy &c. Kauţ. IX, 7 ( at the end) says that the removal of divine calamities is brought about by the worship of deities and by honour to brāhmaṇas and by performing rites prescribed in the Atharvaveda. Manu VII 82 and Yaj. I, 315 state that gifts made to learned brāhmapas are an inexhaustible treasure for the king. The Rājadharmakanda (p. 109) quotes the Brahmapurāpa requiring the king to perform two Lakşahomas every year and also a Kotihoma. The Raja dharmakānda (p. 113 ) and Rājanitiprakāśa (p. 144) quote Udyogaparva 33, 93-95 which set out eight indications of a man's approaching fall, viz, hating brāhmaṇas, opposing brāhmaṇas, depriving them of their wealth, desire to kill or harm them, taking pleasure in calumniating them, not liking their praise, not remembering them in religious acts and get ting angry when they make requests, 

It may be useful and interesting to see how in very ancient times the king was made ready for battle. The Asv. Gr. S (III. 12) says: when a battle is impending (the purohita) should make the king put on his armour (in the following way). The purohita should stand to the west of the chariot (of the king) muttering the hymn (Rg. X. 173) 'I have brought thee &c.'. He should hand over to the king his armour with Rg. VI. 75. 1 *when the man with armour advances it is like the appearance of the cloud &c.'. He hands over the bow with the next verse (Rg. VI. 75. 2 'dhanvanā gā). The purohita should make the king recite the next verse (Rg. VI. 75. 3) and should himself mutter the 4th verse (Rg. VI. 75. 4). He should hand over the quiver to the king with the 5th verse (Rg. VI. 75.5). When the chariot turns in the direction intended the purohita should mutter the sixth verse (Rg. VI. 75. 6). He should recite over the horses the 7th (Rg. VI. 75.7). He makes the king recite the 8th (Rg. VI. 75.8) when the latter looks at the arrows and makes the king recite Rg. VI. 75. 14 ('he envelopes his arm' &c.) when the latter fastens to his arm the leather (that pro tects his arm against the bow-string). When the king is being taken forward in the chariot by the charioteer the purohita ascends the chariot near the king and makes him recite the hymn called Abhivarta (Rg. X. 174) and the two verses (Rg. VIII. 101. 3-4). Then the priest looks at the king with

He should stand in that direction in which the Sun (by day) or Venus (by night) shines and give fight from that direction. The king should pass his hand over the drum with the three verses (Rg. VI. 47. 29-31 'fill with breath (or roar) the heaven and the earth'). The king should discharge arrows with Rg. VI. 75. 16 and the purohita should mutter Rg. VI. 75. 17 ('where the arrows fall together &c.) when soldiers are fighting, or the purohita may direct or teach (the king to recite from the above such verses as are appropriate to his actions ). 308 In the Harşa carita (7th Ucchyāsa first paragraph) Bāņa favours us with a realistic and graphic description of the preparations made when Harsa marched out from his palace on his digvijaya.

Br. 29.9 (where the sanparna hymn is mentioned ) gives an alternative explanation saying that the sauparna hymn referred to is the one declared in the grhyasutra viz. 'pra dhara yantu &c. ', i. e. he does not read 'pradharayantu' as in the printed Asv. Gr. ; on Ait. Br 37.7 (where the Abhivarta, Sāsa, Apratiratha and Sauparna hymns are mentioned) the comment of Sayana as printed reads ' pradhārayantu'.

This shows that the king desiring victory should not face the Sun or Venus (ओशनस) but should have them behind him and that he should not have the wind blowing in his face but blowing behind him. कालिदास in the कुमारसंभव III. 43 'खिमपातं परिहत्य तस्प काम: पुरा शुक्रमिष प्रयाणे| refers to this, on which मल्लिनाथ quotes a verse 'प्रतिशुक्र प्रतिबुध प्रत्यारकमेव च । अपि शक्रसमो राजा इतसैन्यो निवर्तते ॥.. The युक्तिकल्पतरु (ed. by N. N. Law) p. 176 says 'शस्तस्तु देवलमतेपनि पृष्ठतोऽकः' (verse 79). Oldenberg's translation (in S. B. E. vol. 29 p. 234) 'he should commence the battle in the line of battle invented by Aditya or Usadas' is wrong, as will be seen from the above quotations. Hopkins in J. A. O. S. XIII. p. 193n simply follows Oldenberg's translation holding Aditya and Ausanasa to be vyubas.

rising on the eastern horizon) indicative of his conquest of all the four quarters, Harsa was bathed in water poured from silver and golden jars, performed worship of Siva, offered oblations into fire that sent up flames turning from left to right, made gifts of jars full of sesame grains and of cows whose hoofs and horns were tipped with gold, sat on a throne on which tiger-skin was spread &c. 

When starting on an invasion the king was required to perform a rite called nīrājanāvidhi which consisted in waving lights before horses, elephants, banners, armies &c. 309 In II. 30 Kautilya 310 prescribes that on the 9th day of Ašvina lights should be waved before horses and at the beginning and close of invasions and in times of diseases. In II. 32 Kautilya speaks of the waving of lights before elephants thrice in the cāturmāsya (from about July to October) and at the time when two seasons meet. Kālidāsa in the Raghuvamsa 4.25 refers 311 to the per formance of this ceremony when Raghu started on his digvijaya and states ( in 17.13 ) that dūrvā grass, barley sprouts and the bark of the palasa tree were required in the Nirājanāyidhi, Kām. IV. 66 speaks of waving lights before horses and elephants ( nirajita-hayadvipaḥ). The Bṛhatsamhita, chap. 44 (verses 16-28 ) deals with the ceremony of waving lamps before horses, elephants and men. This ceremony had to be performed overy year in the month of Āśvina from the first to the 9th day of the bright half or on the 8th, 12th, or 15th of the bright half of Kārtika (acc. to the Bșhatsamhitā 44.2 ) by those who owned horses and also elephants. It is also described in the Saunaklya II. 8, Agni purāņa 268, Vispudharmottara II. 159 ( quoted at length in the Rājaniti-prakāśa pp. 434-438 ), Kālikāpurāņa 88-15 ff, Nirna yasindhu II. p. 169, Yuktikalpataru p. 178.

with saffron paste and marking nut, with rice grains and white mustard and kuştha plants tied on them were to be sus pended. For seven days mantras addressed to the Sun, Varuna, Viśve-Devas. Prajāpati, Indra and Visņu were to be recited over the horses, during those days the horses were not to be harshly addressed nor struck with a whip and auspicious words were to be addressed to them, conches were to be blown, drums beaten and singing indulged in before them. On the 8th day, to the south of the arch a shed with its face to the north and covered with kusa grass and barks was to be erected and in front of it on a vedi fire was to be lighted and various materials and plants such as sandal-wood were to be collected and thrown into jars full of water, various foods were to be offered as bali, fuel sticks of khadira and other holy trees were to be brought. The king seated on a tiger-skin and facing the east should sit near the fire together with an astrologer and horse doctor and should follow at the direction of the purohita the procedure laid down for Grahayajña ( sacrifice to planets ) and the raising of Indra's banner. A horse and an elephant possessing the most auspici ous signs should be bathed and honoured with new white cloth, sandal-wood paste, garlands and incense and should be hrought to the foot of the arch near the shed with sweet words to the accompaniment of music and conch-blowing. The movements of the horse and elephant should be watched and prognostications made therefrom about victory &c. A ball of food over which mantras have been recited should be offered to the horse and if the latter smells it or eats it that is a sign of coming victory. Dipping an udumbara twig in the jars filled with water and plants the purohita should touch therewith the horse, the elephant, the king and his soldiers to the accompaniment of mantras. Then making an effigy of the enemy the purohita should pierce it with a sharp and pointed stave in the region of the heart with incantations from the Atharvaveda and break it. The purohita should pronounce over the bridle vedic mantras and insert it in the mouth of the horse, which the king should ride and proceed in the north-east together with his army, with drums beaten, concies blown and banners displayed. This is a propitiatory rite ( šānti) as said by Varāhamihira ( Brhat samhita 44.2) and the Agnipurāņa 26.8 and 31 and must have been in vogue centuries before Kautilya flourished,

already been set forth above (p. 71). Conquests resulted in either loss of territory or more generally in the offering of tribute of various kinds to the conqueror viz. wealth ( gold and silver ), horges, elephants, pearls and gems, fine cloth &c. Particularly horses from Kamboja, Bālhika, Gāndhāra and other countries in the north and west were highly prized. Vide Sabhā 51.10, 53.5, Udyoga 86.6, Dropa 156. 47, Sauptika 13. 2; and Sabhā 27. 27, 28. 6 for horses as tribute. In Sabhā 30, 28-30 all the above kinds of tribute are said to have been levied from the Mleccha kings by Bhima 312 

Kautilya devotes one book (VIII) to the discussion of vyasanu. Vyasana 313 means' what deprives a man of great good' (from the root' as to throw with 'vi'). According to Kaut. vyasana may be either the absence of qualities (such as noble birth) or the opposite of such qualities, faults (such as hot temper ), excessive attachment (to women &c. ), harassment ( by invasion or calamities like famines ). So vyasanas may broadly be divided into two classes viz. calamities and faults due to kāma (passion ) and Krodha (hot temper). The view of many ūcāryas is that of the vyasanas of the king, ministers, the people of the realm, fort, treasury, army and ally, the vyasanas of each preceding one are more serious than those of each succeeding one. From the discussion in VIII. 1 it appears that Kautilya in this case agrees with the acāryas. Differing from Bhārdvāja Kaut, holds that the calamities befalling a king or his vices are more serious in their consequences than those of the ministers, since it is the king who appoints the ministers, the purohita, other servants and superintendents of departments and be can employ others in their places and since the rise or fall of the people depends upon him. Disagreeing with Viśālākşa Kautilya holds that the vyasanas of ministers have more serious consequences than those of the people, as all (national) under takings proceed froin the ministers, as the security of person and property from internal and external enemies, adoption of remedies to resist calamities, recruiting of army, collection of taxes are all in their hands. Differing from the school of

Troubles of various kinds 

233 

Parāśara, Kautilya is of opinion that the vyasana of the people has graver consequences than that of the fort (or capital), for forts, treasury and army, all irrigation and agricultural work, stability, bravery and abundance (of things ) spring from the people. Against Piśuna, Kautilya states that the calamities befalling the fort (or capital) give rise to graver consequences than those of the army for the reason that it is in the fort that the treasury and army are kept safe. Kaut. (VIII. 2) holds that internal troubles are more serious than external ones and troubles due to ministers are the most serious of all internal troubles, Kaut. prefers an ignorant ruler ( who has not studied śāstras ) to a king who is bent on swerving from the dictates of sõstras which he knows; he prefers a king suffering from illness to a new king (a conqueror ), a weak but a high-born king to a strong but low-born one. In VIII. 3 he enumerates the several faults and vices which have already been stated above (p. 54 ). After remarking that ignorance and lack of training are the causes of vices or faults, Kaut. discourses on the relative seriousness of the several faults or vices and holds that gambling is worse than hunting, that sexual passion is worse than gambling, that drinking is worse than sexual vice and that gambling is the special cause of dissension among sanghas (corporate assemblies) and among families of nobles that have the characteristics of sanghas. In VIII. 4 he states that among divine visitations like fire, flood, epidemics and famine, floods are more devastating than fire, diseases and epidemics are less destructive than famine, that the loss of outstanding 314 men is more serious than that of common men even in large numbers, since there can hardly be one eminent man among a thousand ordinary or inferior men. He holds that the trouble caused by the Crown Prince is a lesser evil than that caused by a favourite queen. In VIII. 5 Kautilya holds a discussion on the troubles arising from the army and allies. He first enumerates thirty-three matters that may cause trouble with the army, such as not giving due respect to it, or showing contempt to it, not dispensing the pay at the proper time, not preventing diseases from attacking it, having soldiers who are very fond of their wives. He then takes pairs of troubles out of these and states which is the lesser evil of the two. Then he deals with causes that lead to the loss or defection of allies.

In the Rājadharmakāņda, the Rājanitiprakāśa and other works the king is advised to celebrate several rites and festivals, which may be briefly referred to here. They were meant as propitiatory rites to avert national calamities and also to keep the populace in good humour and to afford enjoyment to people. The Rajadharmakānda (pp. 115-117 ) and the Rājanitiprakāśa (pp. 416-419 ) quote about 35 verses from the Brahmapurāņa to the effect that the king is to celebrate in one or more of the six months from Vaiśākha festivals (devayātrā) in honour of various deities such as Brahmā, the gods, the Ganges, Vināyaka, Nāgas, Skanda, the Adityas, Indra and Rudra, the Mātrs ( Durgā and others ), the Earth, Viśvakarman, Vişnu, Kamadeva, Siva, the Moon respectively on the tithis from the 1st to the 15th. The same two works quote a passage of 18 verses from the Skandapurāņa about the festival of moonlight and also the rite of raising the banner of Indra and the latter quotes (pp. 425-433) a long passage from the Vişnudharmottarapurāņa also. Vide H. of Dh. vol. II pp. 825–26 for description of the festival of Indra's banner. They describe the worship of Devi on the 8th and 9th days of Asvina ( from the Devipurāņa ) when animals were sacrificed, the gifts of cows on the Amāvābyā of Kārtika, the rite called Vasordhārā ( stream of wealth). The details of all these are passed over here for want of space. 

CHAPTER X 

PURPOSE OF THE STUDY OF RĀJADHARMA 

AND THE ENDS OF THE STATE 

In the preceding pages an attempt has been made to present a picture of the theory and practice of Government and state craft as delineated by ancient and medieval Indian writers on dharmaśāstra and arthaśāstra. One feature that would strike any reader is the religious colouring with which all theories and ideals are suffused. Another is that the ideal set before rulers and their officers is a highly moral one. Several faults have been found in the theory and practice inculcated by the writers. Except for some centuries before and after the Christian era, monarchy has been the only form of government known in India 

and monarchy alone is generally envisaged by Indian writers. The result has been that the king came in practice to be almost synonymous with government and the State, though a very lofty sense of his duties and responsibilities was impressed on the king. Another defect lies in the almost total absence of discussion on the form and working of oligarchical or republican States. Besides, once the main outlines of the theory of the State were established by the first writers on polity, for about two thousand years succeeding generations of authors were content to follow in the old grooves and hardly ever made any fresh approach to the problems of government or started any rival conceptions or theories. Ancient authors were content to induce the kings and the people to support as far as possible the status quo. They thus provided for a more or less static society and did not encourage any dynamic thoughts or movements. There was no strong or assertive middle class nor was there any organized Church. Though the brāhmaṇas were a sacred class, they were not organized as a body and had to depend only on exhortations and texts to exert influence on the monarchs. It may no doubt be pointed out that similar conditions prevailed almost all the world over. Small States, constant wars and invasions were the commonest phenomena in Europe till the 15th or 16th century and no reproach should be levelled at the Indian writers alone. It cannot, however, be gainsaid that even after experi encing the constant plundering expeditions and religious persecutions of Scythian, Hun and Moslem invaders from the

[ Vol. 

1st to the 11th and the following centuries the able thinkers, warriors and statesmen of India did not enlarge their limited horizon and find means to consolidate and weld together into a united block the numerous small States that were scattered all over India. They could have put forward a common idea and ideal before all the provinces and peoples of India viz. meeting the onslaught of plundering and fanatical invaders, which, if pro perly handled, would have acted as a unifying force. It was to some extent only in Vijayānagara and Mahārāştra that in medieval times means were adopted to weaken the power of the invader, to present a solid front and establish powerful Hindu kingdoms. The old writers spun the same old webs of theories that had been there for centuries, they did not formulate new theories nor did they take steps to infuse into the common people a sense of solidarity and unity as Indians and did not inculcate deep and abiding sentiments of patriotism similar to those we find in Western countries for the last two or three hundred years. In spite of such drawbacks it will have to be conceded that ancient Indian writers made substantial and independent contributions to the theory and practice of Government and that their handiwork can stand comparison with the ancient and medieval thought of most countries of the world, 

· It may be asked: What in these days is the use of the study of the theory and practice of Government in ancient India ? It may be argued that the world is now hoping, as promised by the great leaders of the United Nations, to enjoy several free doms, that great expectations are created in the minds of millions of down-trodden peoples, and that all peoples including Indians will be faced in the near future with democracy and great problems of reconstruction and that knowledge of the past cannot throw much light on the pressing needs of the present or the serious questions that will confront all in the latter half of the 20th century. It may be conceded that the situation in which we find ourselves now and in which we shall be placed in the near future is unique and much light cannot be thrown by a study of the past on the solution of the problems that will have to be tackled by us. But that study has certain useful purposes to serve. Millions of people in India as well as in the world are hardly better than hewers of wood and drawers of water in their own countries. They intensely desire to be masters in their own countries and of their own destinies. The iron has entered

deep in their souls that for countries as well as individuals freedom of action spells happiness and dependence on the will of others is misery (as Manu laconically puts in IV. 160 ), that men who have no independence are hardly human beings ( as the Mārkandeya 125-29 says ).315 The study of the past will give us hope and convey the assurance that we have in the past conducted governments and administrations of vast empires, that we evolved theories and practices which were not inferior to those of some of the most advanced nations of the world, that, allowed opportunities and scope, we may rise equal to what the circumstances may demand of us. On the other hand, such a study will stimulate thought, focus our attention on our mistakes and short-comings, make us be careful to avoid pitfalls and give us indications of the directions in which we must make a new orientation in our ideals and practices. 

At the end of this section on Rājadharma, a question may be asked: what were the ends or purposes that the State in ancient India placed before itself or the dharmaśāstra and arthaśāstra writers said the State should place before itself? The end of the State has been differently stated by different philosophers and theorists of the West from ancient times to the present day. To take only a few examples. To Plato and Aristotle 316 the end of the State was good life for the citizens. But it is not very easy to say what is meant by the good life. Bluntschli in Theory of the State' ( Oxford, 1885 ) Book. V Chap. IV p. 300 formulates the proper and direct end of the State to be 'the development of the national capacities, the perfection of the national life and finally its completion', provided, of course, that the process of moral and political development shall not be opposed to the destiny of humanity. This definition is not easy to grasp. There is no agreement as to what is the destiny of humanity and the concepts of nation and national life are hardly older than a few centuries even in Europe. For ' nation' one may substitute the word ' country'

Engaga u prometre 125. 29. 

316, Aristotle in 'Politics' says 'A state exists for the sake of a good life and not for the sake of life only ... Political society exists for the sake of noble actions and not of mere companionship' (Book III, Chap. 9). 

238

[Vol. 

or 'kingdom'. Then it may be of some application to India. It is impossible to define the end of the State in a single word or in a few words. This question about the end of the State has been partly answered already when speaking of the ideals of kingship. At the risk of some repetition a reply to the above question may be given in the following words. The authors on Dharmaśāstra had a very low estimate of human nature, they believed that ordinarily men were deprayed, that it was difficult to find a man pure by nature and that men were kept in the straight path by the fear of punishment ( Manu VII. 22 = Sānti 3166 15. 34). Yāj. I. 361 requires the king to punish and bring to the proper path castes and guilds when they swerve from their dharma. Kām. (II. 40 and 42-43 ) says the same thing and adds that in the absence of danda the world will revert to the state of mātsya-nyāya ( the strong devouring the weak). Sukra I. 23 says the same thing. The ancient writers did not rely on the natural moral impulses of man and on his will to do the right thing. The same ideas are expressed by some Western writers on law and politics. “A herd of wolves is quieter and more at one than so many men, unless they all had one reason in them or have one power over them' says Jeremy Taylor. Salmond (Jurisprudence p. 65 ) states 'man is by nature a fighting animal and force is the ultima ratio not of kings alone but of all mankind'. We must distinguish between immediate or proximate ends and the ultimate end. The ultimate end or goal of most of our philosophy was mokşa (release or liberation from the ever-recurring cycle of births and deaths and from the miseries and suffering of life). The same was the ultimate goal of rajadharma. But the proximate goal of the State in India was to create such conditions and

environments as would enable all men to live in peace and happiness, to pursue their avocations, to follow their own customs and usages and their "svadharma', to enjoy without interference the fruits of their labour and the property acquired by them. The king was the divinely provided instrument to create the conditions of peace, order and happiness. If the king impartially exercises the power of danda over all, whether his own son or enemy, in proportion to their guilt, he secures this world and the next for himself and the people; the king's scrupulous performance of his own duties leads him and his people to heaven. The task of the State (or the king who represent ed the State ) was to repress by the threat and use of force any violation of the rights of personal freedom and property, to enforce the practice of people's own traditional customs and usages and to take serious care of virtues and dharma. These were the sentiments of Kautilya himself ( III. 1. ).316 At the very threshold of his work he remarks therefore the king should not allow people to swerve from or fail in their duties (dharma); for whoever holds fast by his dharma, observes the rules laid down for āryas and those of castes and aśramas ( the stages of life ) will be happy in this world and the next. The members of society consisting of four castes and having four āśramas when guarded by the king with danda will abide by their respective paths, being devoted adherents of their respective duties and avocations'. 

Both Kām. I. 13 and Sukra I. 67 state : 17 that a king following the path of righteousness confers upon himself and his subjects the group of three viz. the three puruşārthas of dharma, artha and kāma; if he acts otherwise he certainly ruins (himself and the people). The same doctrine is inculcated by other works, such as Sānti 85. %, Mārkandeya 27.29-30.318

(Vol. 

Therefore what the king was to do was to see that the dharmas of varna and aśramu were observed by the people and if they swerved from them to bring them back by punishments. Sukra IV. 4. 39 says that each caste was to observe the rules of the caste handed down from generation to generation and that if its members behaved otherwise they were liable to be punished by the king. The principal works emphasize that each individual in the State should fulfil his own duties ( svadharma) as belong ing to a particular class (varna) or a particular stage of life (aśrama) or his own duties due to the position he occupies and those known as sāmānya dharma such as ahimsā, truthfulness &o. (for which see H. of Dh. vol. II. pp. 10-11) and that the purpose of the State was to enable him to do so and to prevent others from interfering with him. All this laid undue emphasis on the preservation of the status quo, on current beliefs and practices as the ideal. The writers do not emphasize that each individual must actively pursue the good of the society as a whole. As the final goal was mokşa, undue emphasis was laid on other-worldiness, on individual attainment and on detachment and running away from ordinary worldly affairs. The goal of the State was deemed to be to enable men to attain the four puruşārthas, particularly the first three ( as the last viz. mokşa depended only upon individual philosophical insight and mystical experience and was attainable only by a microscopic number). Even the Bārhaspatya-sūtra 1! ( II. 43) says that the fruit of polity was the attainment of dharma, artha and kama. Soma deva begins his Nitivākyāmsta in a characteristic way when he performs obeisance to rājya (the State) that yields the three fruits of dharma, artha and kāma, 320 Kām.321 IV.77 winds up his discussion of the seven elements of rājya with the declara tion that the entire State depends for its highest stability on wealth and the army and that the State when handled by a sagacious minister results in securing the three goals. Kautilya322 (in I. 7) first advises people not to eschew pleasures altogether,

but to enjoy pleasures in such a way as not to conflict with the requirements of dharma and artha, and adds that a man may enjoy in an equal degree the three guals of life that are dependent on each other, since any one of the three if pursued to excess harms not only the other two but also itself. The Dharma gāstra authors held that Dharma was the supreme power in the State and was above the king, who was only the instrument to realize the goal of dharma. To these authors the State was not an end in itself but only a means to an end. Kautilya, true to his position as a writer on arthaśāstra, finally states his opinion that artha is the chief among the three goals, as the other two depend upon wealth for their realization. With this statement of Kautilya, one of the most renowned figures of Indian anti quity, this section on rājadharma may be appropriately brought to a close.VYAVAHARA 

(LAW AND ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE) 

CHAPTER XI 

That to administer justice impartially and to punish the guilty were among the prime functions of the sovereign has been stated above (p. 57). The king was deemed to be the fountain (i. e. the distributor ) of justice. Kautilya 323 (I. 19) prescribes that the king was to look into the disputes of citizens and country people in the 2nd part of the day (divided into eight parts ). Manu (VIII. 1-3) states that the king desirous of looking into the disputes of people should enter the sabhā ( the hall of justice ) accompanied by brāhmaņas, ministers and should there decide every day the causes of litigants. Sukra IV.5.45 is the same as Manu VII. 1, Vas. 16-2, Sankha-Likhita, Yāj. I. 327 and II. 1, Vispu Dh. S. II. 72, Nār. (1.2), Sukra IV. 5.5, Mānasollasa II. 20, verse 1243 state that the administration of justice was the personal concern of the king. The Mit on Yāj. II. 1 says that protecting the subjects is the highest duty of a king and that that duty cannot be discharged without eradicating and punishing the wicked, which latter requires that the king should administer justice ( vyavahāradarśana). Medhatithi on Manu VIII. 1 also says that protection consists in the removal of troubles, secular and spiritual (adrsta ). Manu VIII. 12 and 14 ( = Nār. III. 8-9 p. 42) personifies the administration of justice as Dharma incarnate by representing that when justice is administered the dart of adharma or falsehood by which dharma is pierced is taken out from the body of Dharma. Yāj. (I. 359-360) declares that the impartial administration of justice yields the same rewards as solemn vedic sacrifices do. In this way administra tion of justice was held to be a very sacred duty. Manu VIII. 128 ( = Vļddha-Hārlta VII. 194) declares that a king who punishes those that do not deserve to be punished and who does not punish those that deserve punishment incurs great obloquy and goes to hell. Vas. (19.40-43) prescribes one day's fast for the king and three days' fast for the purohita when the king lets off those that deserve punishment and three days' fast for the king and the kşcchra penance for the purohita when the king

243 

punishes the innocent. The Mahabharata 32s (Anusasana 6:38 and chap.70) and Rāmāyaṇa say that if a king intent on pleasures does not show himself to litigants who approach him for deci sion, he would suffer like king Nrga. The Sukranitisara (IV.5.8) also says the same thing. In the Ramayana (VII. 53-54) king Nřga is said to have been cursed to become a chameleon for a long period by two brāhmaṇas who had a dispute about the ownership of a cow and could not see the king for many days. Megasthenes (Frag.XXVII. pp. 70-71) says the king remains the whole day in court without allowing the business to be interrupted.' Kaut.325 (I. 19) gives the advice that, when in court, the king should not cause petitioners or litigants to wait long at the door, for when a king makes himself inaccessible, those who are near him create confusion about what should or should not be done, whereby the king engenders disaffection among his subjects and makes himself a prey to his foes. The king's court 326 of justice was called dharmasthāna (Sankha Likhita.), dharmāsana (Narada I. 34, Manu VIII. 23, Sukra IV. 5-46 ) or dharmādhikarana ( Kātyāyana and Sukra IV. 5.44 ). * The place where the decision of the truth of the plaint (lit. the cause or root of dispute ) is carried on by a consideration of the rules of the sacred law is called the dharmādhikarana (the Hall of Justice)-says Katyayana. Kalidasa (Sakuntalav) and Bhavabhūti (Uttararāmcarita I.) employ the word dharmāsana* 

The authors of smrtis believed that there was a golden age or era of perfect virtue in the dim past, when men were bent only on right conduct, that later ages saw the advent of sinful

promptings, that therefore regulation of life by the learned and the king came into vogue (compare Gaut. VIII. 1). Manu I. 81-82 ( = Santiparva 231. 23-24) state that in the Krta age dharma prevailed in its perfection, there was no advent of adharma among men then and that in each of the three succeed ing yugas dharma declined progressively by the introduction of theft, falsehood and deceit. The Sāntiparva ( 59. 13 ff) narrates that in the Krta age there was no king and no punishment, that gradually kāma (lust) and rāga (passion) began to wield sway and dharma dwindled away. This belief in an ideal or porfect past was universal and was probably depicted in order to indeve mon to rise higher and higher in goodness and virtuo and to make them submit easily to the discipline of government and the priestly requirements. This ideal description of the past is often found associated with the picture of anarchy that reigned in the dim past which was retrieved from horrors by the creation of the kingly office ( vide pp. 30-34 above). These diametrically opposite views of the past contained in the same works (such as Manu and the Mahabhārata ) probably owe their origin to the desire of the writers to make the common people submit to the absolute rule of kings. Almost all works even from the Rgveda ( X. 10. 10) downwards believe in the progressive deterioration of religion and morals. A state of anarchy is visualised in a few works only for the purpose of glorifying the great usefulness of the institution of kingship. Nār. I. 1 states 327 'when people were solely bent on dharma and were truthful, there existed neither administration of law and justice nor hatred nor jealousy. When dharma declined ( or disappeared) among men, administration of law and justice came to be introduced and the king was declared to be the decider of disputes and the chastiser (of the guilty )'. Br. also (8. B. E, 33 p. 277) says 'In bygone ages men were pre-eminently virtuous and free from cruel tendencies; now that men are overwhelmed by greed and hatred, judicial procedure has to be declared'...

The meaning of sta

transcendental law or the cosmic order by which the universe and even the gods are governed and which is intimately con nected with sacrifice. Vide Rg. I. 68. 2. I. 105. 12, I. 136. 2, I. 142. 7, I. 164. 11, II. 28, 4, IV. 23. 8-10 ( in which the word sta occurs ten times), X. 190. 1. On the relation of rta and law Berolzheimer in his The world's legal philosophies' (translated by Jastrow, New York, 1929 ) says: "closely connected with the religious and philosophical views of the Aryans are certain fundamental positions in regard to the philosophy of law which in turn became the antecedents of later legal and ethical developments among the Greeks and Romans. Foremost among these philosophical conceptions is 'rita', which is at once the organized principle of the universe and the divine ordering of earthly life; as the former it regulates the appearance of the sun and the moon, of day and night and embodies the un changeable principle that pervades the succession of phenomena; as the latter it is affiliated with purpose and human benefit and is exemplified in the flow of the rivers which fertilize the fields; in the cattle useful to men; in the institutions of marriage, of the monarchical state, of the patriarchal home; and in man's sense of responsibility for his sins. The derivative conceptions of vrata ',' dharma ',' dhāma', 'svadha' represent special aspects of 'rita'; thus 'vrata' refers to any specialized embodied 'rita'; while 'dharma' refers specifically to the moral function of rewarding good and punishing evil" (pp. 37-38). Vide Prof. V. M. Apte's paper or "Rta' in the Rgveda (pp. 55-60 of the Silver Jubilee Volume of the Annals of the B. O. R. Institute ) in which he tries to prove that rta means primarily 'the belt of the Zodiao'. 

The word vyavahūra is used in several senges in the sūtras and smộtis. One meaning of vyavahāra is ' transaction or dealing' as in Udyogaparva 37, 30 quoted above (on p. 207) or in Āp. Dh. S. II. 7.16.17, 1. 6.20.11 and 16. It also means a dispute, a lawn suit' in Santi 69.28, Manu VIII. 1., Vas. 16-1, Yāj. II. 1., Vişnu Dh. S. III. 72, Nār. I. 1 and %, Sukra IV. 5.5. A third sense is . legal capacity to enter into transactions' (as in Gaut. X. 48, 

246 

History of Dharmasastra 

[ Vol. 

Vas. 16-8, Sankha-Likhita (rakşed rājā bālānām dhanānyaprāpta. vyavahārānām &c. quoted in V. R. p. 599). A fourth but a rare sense is 'the means of deciding a matter' (as in Gaut. XI. 19 * tasya vyavahāro vedo dharmaśāstrāṇyangāni &c.). In this chapter the word vyavahāra is taken to mean law-suit or dispute in a court' and 'legal procedure'. This sense is very ancient. In the Delhi-Topra Pillar Edict No. 1 of Asoka (Corpus I. I. vol. I. p. 123) we have the word 'viyohālasamatā (vyavahārasamatā) and the word 'vyavahāravidhi' occurs in Kharavela's Hāthigumpha Inscription (E. I. vol. XX. p. 79 ). A voharika-mahāmatta' (vyāvahārika-mahāmātra, minister of justice ) occurs in the Mahāvagga, I. 40. 3 and Chullavagga VI. 4.9). In the medieval digests, both law and procedure are sometimes dealt with in one book as in the Vyavahāra-nirnaya of Varadarāja and the Vyavahāra-mayükha; sometimes the titles of law are treated of in one work and judicial procedure in another. For example, Capdeśvara composed the Vivādaratnākara(on titles of law) and Vyavahāraratnākara ( on judicial procedure). The word vyavahāra is restricted in some works to judicial procedure alone (as in the Vyavahāramātýkā of Jimütavāhana and the Vyavahāratattva of Raghunandana ). The word vivāda which means ' dispute' is often used as a synonym for vyavahāra in the sense of law-guit or legal procedure or both. In Ap. Dh. S. II. 11.29.5 and in Nār. I. 5 vvāda means 'law-suit'. In the Vivādacandra of Misarumiśra and the Vivadatāndava of Kamalakara both law and judicial procedure are treated of. Yaj. (II. 8 and 305 ) appears to distinguish between vivāda (law-suit) and vyavahāra ( judicial procedure). 

The word ' vyavahāra' is defined by several smrtis and com mentators. Kātyāyana gives two definitions, one based on 

etymology and referring principally to procedure and the other giving the conventional sense having in view a dispute. "The (upasarga) v is employed in the sense of various ', 'ava' in the sense of doubt', 'hāra' means ' removing"; vyavahāra' is 80 called because of its removing various doubts" (quoted by V.M. 

III ) 

Definition of Vyavahāra 

247 

p. 283, Par. M. III. p. 7 and Kullûka on Manu VIII. 1 ).377a This definition places the administration of justice on a high plane. The purpose of all branches of Indian philosophy is the quest of Truth or Reality. The purpose of legal procedure is, according to Kāt., the same viz. to find out the truth when there is a dispute. But there are some points of difference. The philosopher may take his own time in his search for truth; but justice has to be done as quickly as possible. Further, legal procedure hag its own method and limitations in finding out the truth, that is, it depends on oral and documentary evidence, while a philoso pher's quest of truth may be purely intellectual and subjective. Another definition is: 'When the ramifications of right conduct, that are together called dharma and that can be established with efforts (of various kinds such as truthful speech &c.), have been violated, the dispute (in a court between parties) which springs from what is sought to be proved (such as a debt), is said to be vyavahāra'. Hārita gives an easier definition:' that is declared to be vyavahāra where the attainment of one's wealth (taken away by another) and the avoidance of the dharmas of others ( such as those of heretics ) are secured with the help of) the means of proof'( quoted by the Sm. C. II. p. 1). The Mit. (on Yāj. II. 1) defines vyavahāra as averment (about a matter) as related to oneself in opposition to another'. Sukra IV. 5. 4 gives another definition. The Vyavahāramayukha gives a much

more elaborate definition ( vide text p. 1 and notes pp. 3-4 of my ed.). 

A vyavahārapada 32 means the topic or subject matter of litigation or dispute'. It is the same thing as 'vivādapada' which word occurs also in Kaut. (III. 16 p. 191 and IV. 7 p. 218) and in Nār. ( dattāpradānika 1, abhyupetyāśuśrüşā 1). Manu VIII. 8 shows that 'pada' means' sthāna'. Yāj. II. 5 defines it as ' If a person, who is set at naught by others in a manner that is opposed to the rules of smrti and to good usage or conventions, informs the king (or his judge ), that is a vyavahārapada'. From very ancient times eighteen vyava hārapadas have been enumerated. The underlying idea is that most of the disputes between men can be classified under 18 heads. Even Manu ( VII. 8 ) was conscious of the fact that the enumeration of 18 vyavahārapadas was a matter of a convenient arrangement and that the number 18 did not embrace all disputes whatever but only the largest number of disputes and the most important among them. Medhātithi and Kullūka make this position quite clear. 329 

. There is some difference about the number and nomen clature of the vyayahārapadas among Manu and other writers of smộtis. The following table will give some idea of the divergence as to nomenclature and the sequence in which they are treated of. All do not mention them in the same order as in Manu VIII. 4-7. For example, the order in Yāj. is rņādāna, upanidhi, dayavibhāga, simā-vivada, svāmipālavivāda, asvami. vikraya &c. Yāj. does not enumerate all of them in one place as Manu and Nārada do.

History of Dharmasastra 

[Vol. 

It will be noticed that Yāj. omits the duties of husband and wife from the 18 topics of vyavahāra as he had already dealt with them in his section on ācāra, adds abhyupetyasuśrūşā and prakirņaka (miscellaneous wrongs ) and splits krayavikrayānu say& into two and thus gives 20 topics. Nārada (I. 16-19 ) has the same 15 topics as those of Manu (in some cases under slightly different names), omits svāmipālavivādā, steya and strisangrahaņa, adds abhyupetyāśusrūşā and another topic viz. prakirpaka and splits krayavikrayānusaya into two, viz. krītānu saya and vikrīyāsampradāna. He includes steya under sāhasa (sāhasa verge 21 ) and also in what is an appendix. Bșhaspati as quoted in the Smộti-candrikā (vyavahāra p. 9) names the 18 vyava harapadas and adds prakirpaka. Kautilya also adds prakirnaka and omits steya' under his dharmasthiya section, though he deals with theft elsewhere ( as in IV. 8 and 11). It is not to be supposed that the 18 topics were first started by the Manusmrti. Gaut. XII. 1 mentions vākpāruşya and dandapārusya, treats of some of the topics without specifying the technical names e. g. he refers to the subjects of sangrahana ( in XII, 2-3), of theft (XII. 12-13), of svāmipālavivāda (in XII. 16 ff), of rņādāna (in XII. 26-33), of nidhi (in XII. 39), of dayavibhāga (in XXVIII). Similarly the Ap. Dh. S. speaks in scattered places of some of the topics of vyavahāra such as murder ( i. e. sāhasa ) in 1. 9. 24, of adultery in I. 9. 25. 1-2 and 1. 10. 28. 15-20, II. 10. 26. 18 ff, theft in I. 9. 25. 4-11, dāyavibhāga in II. 6. 14, vākpāruşya in II. 10. 27. 14. Vas. also mentions the word dāyavibhāga ( in XVII. 40 ) and sets out rules about it and about means of proof (XVI. 13-15), about mādāna (XVI. 31 ), about the twelve kinds of sons (XVII. 12-39). The Baud. Dh. S. (II. 2. 8) employs the word dāyavibhāga and gives several rules on that subject. Thus some at least out of the eighteen vyavahārapadas ( such as vākpāruşya, dapdapārusya, dāyabhāga, steya ) were distinctly recognized centuries before the present Manusmrti was composed. Someśvara in Mānasollāsa (II. 20. verses 1265-1273) enumerates 22 vyavahārapadas, by splitting dattasyānapākarma into two as datta and dattāpahāraka, adds svāmibhrtyavivāda after svami pālavivāda, counts krayavikrayānusaya as two and dyūta samāhvaya as two distinct topics. 

The definition of vyavahārapada in Yāj. II. 5 ( = Sukra IV. 5. 68) viz. 'if a person informs or complains to the king' (avedayati ced rājne) conveys that vyavahārapada means and includes only those disputes that are started or brought before 

III 1 

King not to initiate certain disputes

the Court at the instance of the parties. Manu VIII. 43 pres cribes that neither the king nor his officers should start a dispute (i, e, a legal proceeding), nor should he sit silent upon (hush up) a matter which has been brought before him by another (i, o, by a party ). Gaut. XIII. 27 lays down that a party should humbly approach a judge with his complaint. Katyāyana (27) states: 'The king 330 should not, through influence or through greed of money, take upon himself the disputes of men, when they do not theniselves want to contend (in a court)'. Mānasollāsa IL 20 verse 1274 and Sukra IV. 5. 69 say the same. There must have always been several matters, of which nobody might complain and which the king might have to look into suo motu. Manu after dealing with the 18 vyavahārapadas ( in VIII. 1 to IX, 251 ) requires the king ( in IX. 252-253) to make offorts to destroy kantakas (thorns, harmful persons) and dilates upon many aspects of his activities in this respect. Nārada relegates all matters in which the king took action suo motu to a separate topic, prakirnaka, about which he says ' under prakirņaka are comprised lawsuits depending on the king (i. e. on the king's own action ) such as transgressions of the king's commandments and obedience to his injunctions, grants of towns, dissensions among the constituent elements (such as ministers) of the State, the duties and breaches there of among heretics, followers of the veda, corporations (of merchants) and groups, dispute between father and son, neglect of prescribed penances, abstraction of gifts made to worthy persons, the wrath of hermits, sinful confusion of castes and the rules regarding their maintenance and ( in short) whatever (matter) has been omitted in the preceding ( vyavahārapadas )--these are treated under prakirpaka '. 331 Bphaspati defines prakirņaka in

the same way as Nārada. Kautilya deals with the vyavahāra padas in his Dharmasthiya (III) section and in the Kantaka sodhana section (IV) speaks of matters that are similarly dealt with by officers called pradeştī8 (who correspond to coronerg and police magistrates of modern times), while matters falling under the dharmasthiya section (viz. the vyavahārapadas ) were disposed off by judges ( called dharmasthas). Kantaka means in Kautilya as in Manu IX, 252 'harmful persons'. The chief matters that fell within the purview of the kantakasodhana (removal or punishment of harmful persons ) officers or courts were : Artisans like blacksmiths and carpenters were generally to work in guilds and receive from people materials for working them up; if they caused unreasonable delay in handing back finished articles, they were to receive one-fourth less than the proper wages and were to be fined twice the amount of wages ; similar provisions are made for loss of wages and fines for Weavers who do not increase the weight of cloth (cotton, linen, silk, or woollen) woven up to the usual standard: washermen were to wash clothes on wooden planks or smooth stones, but if they washed them elsewhere, they were to pay compensation for loss caused and a fine of 6 paņas; they were to be fined twelve panas for the sale, pledge or hiring out of other's clothes; they were also to be fined for keeping clothes with them beyond the time ordinarily required; for washing the best garments, garments of middling quality and inferior garments the wages were respectively one papa, ) and ; trust worthy persons and experts were to decide disputes about colour and wages; similar rules apply to tailors ; goldsmiths, who 

(Continued from the last page) In an interesting paper contributed to the Sir Denison Ross volume of papers pp. 234-240 Dr. V. Raghavan describes a work called 'Vaisyavamsa sudhakara' composed by Kolācala Mallinātha, the renowned commentatot of the five classical Sanskrit Kāvyas. This work is the report or decision given by a commission presided over by Mallinātha appointed to settle & dispute (which in these days might be called a caste question not cognisable by civil courts) that arose in the times of Devaraya II. of Vidyanagara (1422-1466 A. D.). Vaisyas were given a license to trade in the 24 citics and 108 shrines of the realm; certain subcastes like the Komațis claimed to be vaisyas and this privilege also. Mallinātha decides after a searching examination of authorities that the words vaisya, vanik, nagara, ūruja, třtiya. jātiya are synonyms, that Komatis, who were styled vijātis by their rivals, were vaisyas and entitled to all the privileges of vaisyas. This decision would come under either parte ... fata: or a TefTTA.

without informing (government officers ) purchased from un clean hands (1. e. from menial servants or slaves ) without changing the form of the article or after changing the form, or purchased from a thief were to be fined respectively 12, 24 or 48 paņas ; for stealing one ( gold) māşaka (one-sixteenth of a suvarna ) from off a suvarna, the gold-smith was to be fined two hundred paņas and for stealing one māsaka out of a silver dharana there was a fine of twelve paņas ; fines are provided for loss of weight ( beyond the recognised standard) in the case of working up copper, lead, brass, bell-metal, tin into vessels and articles; for manufacturing a counterfeit coin, for accepting it or passing it off to another the fine was a thousand panas and for entering a counterfeit coin in the royal treasury the punishment was death; a physician, who undertook the medical treatment of a patient without informing (government officers) of the dangerous nature of the disease, was to be punished with the first amercement if the patient died and with the middling fine if the patient died through the carelessness of the physician and if the patient suffered some vital injury, the matter was to be dealt with as assault (dandapārusya); musicians and actors shall stay in one place during the rainy season and shall avoid taking excessive gifts or indulging in excessive praise of one patron ; for violating this rule the fine was twelve paņas. The same rules apply to those who show dumb plays and to other mendi cants, the latter receiving as many lashes as the fine imposed in similar cases on others. In IV. 2 Kautilya prescribes fines against merchants that use false measures, weights and balances ; that sell timber, iron, jewels, ropes, clothes mis representing them as superior when they are inferior ; that conspire to prevent the sale of merchandise; that cause adultera tion of grains, oils, salt, medicines &c.; that raise the prices beyond those fixed by the superintendent of commerce for local commodities and for foreign produce. In IV. 3 Kaut. provides for measures against such calamities as fire, floods, pestilen tial diseases, famine, rats, tigers, serpents and prescribes a fine of twelve papas for catching or injuring cats and mongooses employed to destroy'rats. In IV. 4 Kauţ, prescribes the measures that the officer called samahartr has to take to protect the subjects against those who prey upon the people secretly by employing foul means. He has to employ spies under various disguises to find out the honesty or corruption of officers in the villages, of superintendents, of judges, of magistrates and witnesses and the punishment in these cases is generally

Kautilya IV. 5 deals with the detection of young men inclined to robbery and adultery by the employment of spies and agents provocateurs in the guise of ascetics and persons reput ed to possess miraculous powers. The Kauţillya IV.6 and 7 respec tively describe the seizure of criminals on suspicion or in the very act itself and examination in cases of sudden death. Kaut. IV. 8 speaks of questioning in the presence of the wronged party of the witnesses of the accused, whether they are his relatives or total strangers, as regards the country, the caste, the family, the name, occupation, property, friends and residence of the accused and of the application of torture to the accused to elicit an admission of guilt. It is said that torture is to be applied only in the case of those whose guilt is believed to be established prima facie (āptadoşam karma kūrayet), that torture is not to be employed when the accused is guilty of a minor offence, is under age, old or diseased, is under the influence of intoxicants, or is a lunatic, or is overwhelmed by hunger or thirst or fatigue due to a journey, or has eaten to excess or is suffering from indigestion or is weak, nor is it to be employed in the case of a pregnant woman or a woman who was delivered of a child within a month; and in the case of other women only half the torture prescribed for males or only the asking of questions is to be employed. Learned brāhmaṇas and ascetics ( when accused) are to be subjected to espionage only. Those who violate these rules or incite others to do so and those who are guilty of causing the death of an accused by torture are to be punished with the highest amercement. Four kinds of torture were employed in the case of complaints about wrongs viz. six dandas, seven whippings, two kinds of suspen sion, and ( fourthly ) water-tube (i. e. injecting salt water in the nose from a tube ). 332 In this chapter Kaut. states that one who 

332. The exact meaning of the four kinds of torture is not clear. Prof. V. R. Dikshitar in 'Hindp Admiaistrative Institutions' pp. 237-247 tries very hard to establish that Kauţ, recommends no torture in any case, that 'vākyānuyoga' means 'pronouncing of guilt by the jury' and karmūnu. yoga means judgment of the Chief Justice'. Though the learned Professor's attempt to exculpate Kautilya may be due to laudable motives, the words of Kautilya are too clear to admit of any other interpretation than the one given above, If one dispassionately considers the fact that no karma was allowed to be employed in the case of the weak, the diseased, old men &c., that in the case of women 'ardhakarma' alone was allowed, that a heavy fino was imposed for causing death by karma (karmanā vyāpādanena ).

charges an innocent man with being a thief or who conceals & thief is to be punished like a thief and that even one who is not a thief may for fear of torture admit that he is a thief, as Māndavya did. Kaut in IV, 9 prescribes that the samā lart? and pradeştrs should exercise control over all superintendents of the various State departments and their subordinates, that those who steal or seize valuable articles or jewels from State mines or manufactories should be simply sentenced to death, prescribes various fines and punishments for stealing or re moving by force articles of different prices from the State granaries and store-houses, provides punishment for judges that threaten, browbeat, send out or unjustly silence or abuse litigants or that do not ask proper questions or ask improper questions, that cause unnecessary delay, unjustly rehear causes that have been heard or disposed of, and provides heavy punish 

(Continued from the last page) that Mandavya, though really not a thief, declared that he was so through the fear of the torments of karna (karmakleśabhayat), that in the four karmas we find suspension and water-tube and that immediately after the words. karnia karayet we get the rule that in all crimes the brāhmana was not to be subjected to bodily pain, it will have to be admitted that 

karma' in this chapter of the Arthasāstra means 'torture'. One fails to see what 'ardhakarma'in the case of women will mean if 'karma' signifies only the judgment of the chief justice or why Mandavya should bave confessed theft through fear of 'karmakleśa'. And one need not feel apologetic if Kautilya recommends torture in certain well-defined cases, Torture was an essential part in tbe Roman Criminal Procedure and Augustus had issued an edict about it. Vide Stephens'. History of English Criminal Law' vol. I, pp, 47-49. Torture by the police and third-degree methods are not unknown in the 20th century in the West (even apart from the latest German methods) or in India, though they are not expressly mentioned in any text-book or Act as allowable. Vide Harry E, Barnes' 'Story of Punish ment' pp. 10-15 for various kinds of tortures employed in the West for several centuries and third-degree methods (pp. 15-24), which be asserts are even now in almost universal use by the Police Department in the U. S. A. The story of Māndavya who though not a thief was held to be a thief, because he, owing to his vow of silence, did not reply whes questioned and near whom was found the booty stolen and who was impaled, is found in Adi. 63. 92-93 (cr. ed. chap. 57). Adi, 107–108 (cr. ed. chap. 101 ), Anusāsana 18. 46-50 and is Nār, (I. 42) and Br. quoted by Aparārka (p. 599). शूले मोतः पुराणपिरचोरचोरशङ्गया। अणीमाष्य इत्येवं विख्यातः सुमहायशाः ॥ आदि 63. 92-93. Kaut. IV. 8 appears to have had a different version of the story before him, The Mārkandeyapurāņa chap. 16 has the story of Animāndavya. The story of Māndavya was a leading case, it appears, in criminal law. The Mşcchakatika ( Act IX. 36 ) appears to refer to torture,

ments for releasing persons jailed or for rape on a woman in a look-up. Kaut. IV. 10 prescribes alternative punishments of fines in lieu of the cutting off of fingers or mutilation of limbs for several offences such as theft or assault, abuse and defamation or showing contempt to the king by riding his horse or other conveyance or fabricating royal orders, prescribes death for selling human flesh, simple death or highest amercement for stealing images of gods or animals, for abducting human beings or for wrongfully seizing fields, houges, gold, gold coins, jewels and crops. Death with or without torture is provided for in Kaut. IV, 11 for murdering a man in a quarrel (but when the wounded man dies a fortnight or a month after the quarrel, highest fine or fine of five hundred paņas and the expenses of medical treatment); different kinds of punishments are provided for wounding with a weapon, impalement for causing violent death of men and women, burning alive for those who aim at securing the kingdom or force entrance into the royal harem or incite wild tribes or enemies or instigate disaffection in the capital or country or army, drowning (or solitary confinement in a dark room, acc. to another reading ) for a brahmana offender of this sort, cutting of tongue for insulting or abuse of parents or a teacher or an ascetic, drowning for one destroying the dam of a tank or for a poisoner or for a woman murdering a man, tearing to death by bulls for a woman who murders her husband or child or her elders or administers poison or sets fire. Kaut. adds that the punishment of death with torture has been prescribed by ancient smrti-writers, but that it is proper to order simple death in cases of offences in which no cruelty enters. Kaut. IV. 12 starts by declaring that no man shall have sexual intercourse with a woman (not his wife ) against her will, prescribes different punishments for forcible sexual intercourse with an immature girl or a girl that has attained maturity, of the same caste, or of a different caste, provides that for inter course with a willing maiden the fine will be 54 panas for the man and 27 for the maiden, further provides that it is no offence for a man of the same caste to have intercourse with a maiden who has not been got married for three years after the appearance of menses, provides fines for deceitfulness in substitut ing one girl at marriage while showing another before, provides that if a woman whose husband is gone abroad commits .adultery a relative or servant of the husband may keep her under restraint and that if the husband on his return forgives the woman her paramour may not be proceeded against,

Kautilya on punishments

but if he does not condone, the nose and ears of the woman may be cut off and the paramour should be sentenced to death. Kaut. IV. 13 provides punishment for brāhmaṇas eating or drinking what is forbidden to them and varying fines for administering forbidden food or drink to members of the four varnas, provides fines for house-trespass and lurking house-tres pass by night, provides punishments for witchcraft, provides burning alive in a vessel for adultery with the queen and other punishments for adultery with women of the several castes, whether guarded or unguarded, prescribes a fine of 24 papas for adultery with a nun. 

The above is a meagre summary of Kautilya's section on kaptakasodhana. Kautilya is encyclopaedic on this subject as on several others. The number of offences dealt with by him is very large and his treatment in some respects compares favourably with such modern criminal codes as the Indian Penal Code, Many of the provisions contained in Kaut. IV are found in Yaj. (II. 273-304), in Nārada (in prakirņaka and elsewhere) and also in Manu (e. g. VIII. 365-368 about rape or adultery, VIII. 396-97 about washermen and weavers, IX. 225-226 about musicians and dancers, IX. 231-232, IX. 261-267). Why Kaut. treats of several offences under kantakasodhana and not under the dharmasthiya section, it is somewhat difficult to say. It is probable that he included under dharmasthiya only those complaints or actions that were fought out between the parties, even though many of the wrongs complained of under vākpārusya, danda pārusya, sangrahana and steya were criminal and the same as those treated of in the section on kantakaśodhana. In wrongs dealt with in the kantakasodhana section it was the king or king's officers who themselves brought up the offenders for punishment and the offences were viewed not as mere private matters, but as matters in which the State was concerned for the eradication of crime in general. Kautilya in III. 20 speaks of prakirnaka but therein he seems to include some miscellaneous matters like non-return of borrowed articles or deposits ( at the proper time and place), evading payment of ferry tax under the pretence of being a brāhmaṇa, connection with a public woman kept by another, misappropriating revenue collected as agent for a householder, a cāņdāla's touching an Arya woman, invit ing for dinner in honour of Gods and Manes Buddhist or Ajivaka or Sudra mendicants, abandonment of parents, child, wife or husband, brother or sister, teacher or pupil (when not

guilty of a grave sin), wrongful confinement of a person &c. Kautilya does not apparently include under prakirņaka all matters in which the king acts suo motu as Nār., Bộ, and Kāt. do but includes these latter under kantakaśodhana. He, how ever, states here and there (IV. 1 and 13) that the matters dealt with under kantakasodhana are quite analogous to those under such titles as daņdapāruşya treated of under the dharmasthiya section. For example, in IV. 1. he says that if a physician through negligence causes loss of a vital part to a patient then the matter may be treated as daņdapārusya. 333 So Kautilya probably represents a much earlier stage of judicial administra. tion than Nār. or Br., who included under prakirpaka all matters in which the king acted of his own motion (i. e. all that falls under kantakasodhana in Kaut.). 

The enumeration of vyavahārapadas is very ancient and authoritative, but there is hardly any scientific principle of classification underlying them. A writer called Nibandha nakāra quoted in the Sarasvativilāsa 34 (p. 51) holds that in all the vyavahārapadas from mạādāna to dāyavibhāga the relief claimed is something to be given or rendered (deya) by one party to the other, while in vākpāruşya, dapdapārusya, sābasa, gambling and betting the principal relief is in the form of danda (punishment). Here there is a glimmering of the dis tinction between civil and criminal litigation. Two deep-seated principles in the administration of law and justice everywhere are 'fulfil your promises' and 'cause injury (himsā) to no one'. It is therefore that we find Bșhaspati stating that lawsuits are of two kinds according as they originate in (demands about) wealth or in injuries. Yāj. II. 23 speaks of arthavivāda (civil dispute) and so made a distinction between civil and criminal disputes. Lawsuits * originating in wealth are divided into

fourteen sorts and those originating in injuries are of four sorts These last are vākpārusya (defamation and abuse), dandapārusya (assault and battery), sāhasa (murder and other forms of violence) and strisangraha (adultery). Here there is a clear distinction made between civil disputes (arthamula or dhanamüla) and criminal ones ( hitsa-müla). Kāt, also says that disputes have their source in two viz. not rendering what should be given and injury (hiṁsā). Though in this way a distinction was made between civil and criminal disputes among the 18 titles of law, it appears that the set of rules and the procedure in both were the same (except as to the time allowed for reply, as to the qualifica tions of witnesses and as to proxies), the same courts tried both kinds of disputes and not as in modern times when civil disputes are tried in one class of courts and criminal complaints in another and when the procedure also in both differs a great deal). There were not two sets of courts in ancient India as there were in England before the fusion of Law and Equity, but all courts in ancient and medieval India were required to administer the law of the texts tempered by common sense and reason as laid down by Bṛ.: 'a decision should not be given by merely relying on the text of the sastra; when consideration of a matter is divorced from reason and common sense loss of dharma results' (g. by Aparārka p. 599). 

Nār. (I. 8-29), Bp., Kāt., the Agnipurana ( 253, 1-12 which reproduce almost verbatim the verses of Nār.) and others predicate several things about vyavahāra, such as that it is dviphala ( has two results ) and so on. All these are brought together here below for convenience. Vyavahāra is :

Among the verses at the end of IV. 1 of the Arthasāstra the follow ing two verses occur: **** 2 EETTE Å TIETTI Parrut: TTATA: पूर्वबाधकः तत्र सत्ये स्थितो धर्मों व्यवहारस्तु साक्षिषु।चरित्रं संग्रहे पुंसां राज्ञामाज्ञातु शास 971. These two occur in Nār. (I. 10-11) and Harita (q. in S. V. p. 58) with variations, viz. both read चतुष्पाद व्यवहारोपमुत्तर पूर्व० and चरित्र पुस्तकरणे. Par. M. III, p. 10 reads arts a French. Lengthy explanations of these verses are offered in Aparārka (p. 597), Smsticandrikā (II. pp. 10-11), Vyavahāra prakasa (pp. 7, 88–89) and other digests. It has to be noted that the four (dbarma &c.) mentioned in these verses are the means of arriving at a decision in a law-suit, as Bř. says: UAU &Tugirar for TTATI 041tt fra: hardArrufa: (in Fyra T.

and Br. they are the plaint, the reply, the proof (kriya) and decision (nirnutya) or acc. to Kāt. 31 (q. by Aparārka p. 616) plaint, reply, prutyākalita 337 and kriya. 

Dharma and the other three are really the four feet of nirnaya (final decision), which is one of the four stages of a law-guit (vyavahāra) and so only in a secondary or far-fetched sense they are the four pādas of vyavahāra. Each of these four is said to be of two kinds. Vide Sm. C. II. pp. 10-11, Par. M. III. pp. 198–199, V. P, pp. 87-88 where the verses of Bộ. are set out and fully explained. A decision is said to be arrived at according to dharma when the wrong-doer admits his guilt or wrong-doing and the real owner secures his wealth or the relief due to him without having to undergo the trouble of a protracted trial by means of witnesses, documents &c. Similarly a decision to be arrived at by ordeals is said to be one by dharma. Dharma and satya are often identified (vide note 125 above) and here the wrong-doer tells the truth and the decision is therefore said to be by dharma. When a litigation is fought out in Court by citing witnesses, the decision is said to be by vyavahāra. "Witnesses' are mentioned only by way of illustration (and imply docu ments, possession and other means of proof). When a defendant is guilty of not giving a straight reply or when his reply is tainted with faults and so is unacoeptable and a decision is given against him on that ground alone it is still a decision by vyavahāra. Caritra means 'the usages of a country, village or family' ( desasthitih pūrvakītā caritram sumudāhrtam --Vyāsa q. in Sm. C. II. p. 11 and Vy. Nir. p. 138). This seems to be the sense of 'caritra' in 'phalakavāre charitratoti' occurring in Nasik Inscription No. 12 in E. I. vol. VIII, p. 82. In prakirnaka 24 Nār. seems to give the same sense 'sthityartham prthivipālais. caritravisayāḥ kṣtāḥ' Caritra also means ' anumāna '(posses sion and presumptions). 'Anumānena nirnitam caritramiti kathyate'-says Br. quoted in Vy. Nirpaya p. 139 and Par. M. III. p. 198. Usages are the means of decision in certain cases apart from the question whether they are supported by the smrtis or 

337. Pratyākalita means, acc. to Aparārka p. 616, the deliberation of the judge and sabhyas as to where the burden of proof (onus probandi) lies and as to the method of proof. Acc. to the Mit. on Yāj. 11. 8, pratyākalita in this sense is not a vyavahārapāda, since it is not directly related to the litigants. Acc. to Nār. II. 21 pratyākalita seems to mean an addition to the plaint or to the reply (i.e. a supplementary written statement), aerat लिखिताभोषं परपुनवादिना स्मृतम् । तत्प्रत्याकलितं नाम स्वपादे तस्य लिख्यते ॥.

The four pūdas of vyavahāra

not. 'Caritram pustakarane' means that such usages are valid means of decision if they have been written down or recorded by the king, while 'caritram tu svikaraņe' (the reading in Par. M.) means ' usages become the rule of decision when they are accepted as valid by the people and by the courts'. When a king issues in a matter of dispute an order which is not opposed to smrtis or local usages and which is thought out as the most appropriate one by the king's intellect or which is issued to decide a matter when the authorities on each of two sides are equally strong, it is a decision by royal command. Br. ( in Par, M. III. p. 148 ) and Kāt. (verses 35-38 q. in Sm. C. II. p. 10, Par. M. III. pp. 16-17, V. P. p.7) explain the above four. Bphaspati gives two meanings of caritra: (1) what is decided by inference ; () the usages of a country. When it is said that each later one of the four stultifies each preceding one, the idea is not that in all cases it is so, but that it is so only in some cases. Vide Kāt. ( 43 g. by V. P. p. 90 ) which makes this clear. Some examples may be given. If one litigant says that he would prove his case by an ordeal, while the other says that he will prove his contention by human means ( documents or witnesses &c.), then the trial by ordeal is not to be resorted to but the hearing of the case is to proceed in the ordinary way. Vide Kāt. 218 (q. by Mit. on Yāj. II. 22 ) for this rule. Here dharma is set aside in favour of vyavahāra. Another example is given in the Par. M. III. p. 18. A person belonging to one of the four varnas commits a seditious act (rājadroha) and through timidity admits his guilt ( this is satya ), but the witnesses ( relying on Manu X. 130 that where the punishment would be death, a witness may tell a lie ) deny that he was guilty of the act and he is let off. Here dharma is set aside in favour of vyavahāra (trial based on the depositions of witnesses). Vide Sm. C. (II. p. 11 ) for another similar example. In the country of Kerala visiting a prostitute was not condemned by oustom. So even though it is established by witnesses that a person in Kerala did so, the local king may not punish him with a fine. Or suppose a person is charged with the offence of adultery with the wife of au ābhira and this fact is established by witnesses. Yet the man charged may show that among the abhiras there is a usage ( written down in the census records of the king ) that adultery with an abhira woman is not punish able. In such cases caritra (usage ) annuls the (ordinary) vyavahāra. But suppose that in such cases the king, in order to improve the morals of a section of his subjects, issues a262 

History of Dharmasāstra 

(Voi. 

proclamation that from the date of the proclamation one who is guilty of adultery with an abhira woman will be punisbed, then in that case usage will be set aside by royal command, which will then be the rule of decision. Similarly where there are no witnesses nor documents nor possession and no room for ordeal and there are no texts and local usages it is the king who has to decide as best as he can. Vide Pitamaha q. in Sm. C. (IL p. 28). Kāt. (verses 39-43 q. in V. P. p. 89) describes how and when each later one sets aside each prior one. 

Catusthāna-having four bages viz. satya, witnesses, pustakarana and rājaśāsana. 

Catuhsādhana-having four means viz. sūma, dūna, bheda and danda. 

Caturhita--benefitting the four ( the four varņas and four asramas ). 

Caturvyāpin--that envelopes or reaches four viz. the dis putants, witnesses, the sabhyas and the king. 

Catuşkārin---that brings about four results viz. dharma ( justice ), gain, renown, love or regard of the people. 

Aştānga-.it has eight limbs or members viz., the king, his good officer (chief judge ), sabhyas ( puisne judges ), sastra (law books ), accountant, scribe, gold, fire and water. 

Aştādaśapada-has eighteen titles (viz. rņādāna and others enumerated above). 

Sutašakha--having a hundred branches. This is approximate. Nās. (I. 20-25 ) states that the 18 titles have 132 sub-heads (rņādāna 25, upanidhi 6, sambhūyasamutthāna 3, dattā. pradānika 4, aśusrüsā 9, vetana 4, āsvāmivikraya %, vikrsya dāna 1, kritānuśaya 4, samayasyānapākarma 1, kşetravāda 12, stripumsayoga 20, dāyabhāga 19, sāhasa 12, vākpāruşya and daņdapāruşya 3, dyūtasamābvaya 1, prakirņaka 6 ). 

Triyoni - having three springs or motives viz, kama (sexual desire), krodha (hot temper), lobha ( greed). 

Duyabhiyoga--founded on two kinds of complaint viz. on suspicion or on fact. Nār. I. 27 says that a complaint on Buspicion may be made against those who associate with men of evil repute ( such as thieves, gamblers and dissolute persons ) or it may be made on the ground that a certain person is really

the thief because the thing stolen is found with him (this is tattvābhiyoga). This latter may take two forms i.e. the grievance of the plaintiff may be negative (e. g. the defendant took or borrowed a debt or article and does not return it ) or positive (e. g. the defendant has dispossessed the plaintiff of land ).338 Vide Mit. on Yāj. II. 5. 

Dvidvāra-having two openings i. e. it is based on the statements in the plaint and those in the reply. 

Dvigati --having two issues, that is, the decision may be founded on truth or on error. 

Dvipada-having two aspects, viz. relating to wealth and so civil (dhanamūla), and relating to injury and so criminal (hiṁsāmūla). This is acc. to Kāt. 29. 

Dvirutthāna “having two springs or sources. It is the same as above. Hārita and Kāt. 30 mention this. 

Duiskandha-having two trunks viz. dharmaśāstra and arthaśāstra (acc. to Kāt. 32). 

Driphala--having two results, victory or failure ( Kāt. 32 ). 

Ekamüla---Hārita and Kāt. mention this. It means 'having only one ( viz. what is to be established) as its root'. 

Sapana and apanamwhere both parties to the litigation or one of the parties stakes (either through pride or anger or belief in the truth of his case ) a certain sum of money to be paid by him in case of his defeat, that is called sapana law-suit ( Yāj. II. 18); in this case the defeated party will pay to the king the usual fine for a defeated party and also the sum staked by him and will deliver to the successful party what is due to him. Vide also Vişnudharmottara III. 324, 44. A lawsuit may also be apaņa (without a stake being declared). Nār. (I. 4) employs the words sottara and anuttara for these two. 

The Sm. C. (II. pp. 27-28), Par. M. (III. pp. 42-45), Sarasvati vilāsa pp. 73-74, V. P. pp. 36-38, state that, according to Pita maha, the king may take cognizance of his own motion without

the complaints of private persons of certain matters called (pa rādhas, padas and chulus and these works set out the lists of ten aparādhas, 22 padas and 50 chalas 339 The king may himself come to know about these or these matters may be brought to his notice by an officer called sūcaka or a private man called stobhaka, defined acc. to Kāt. ( 33-34 ) as follows:- 340 that man is declared to be sūcaku who is appointed by the king himself for finding out the wrong-doings of people and who on coming to know of them conveys them to the king; that man is a stobhaka who with a sole eye to money and without being urged by the king informs the king first of actions (among the people) that are condemned by the śāstras.' Therefore a stobhaka is a private informant for money. The ten aparādhas, acc. to Nār, are: disobedience of the king's order, murder of a woman, confusion of varņas, adultery, theft, pregnancy from one not the husband, abuse and defamation, obscenity, assault ( danda pārusya), abortion 341. They were called aparādhas because they were met with fine. It will be noticed that some of these come under several vyavahārapadas and some like 'varnasankara' are included in prakirņaka by Nārada (v.4). The king could by his own action investigate these even if no private complaint he lodged. Samvarta (quoted by the Sm. C. II. p. 28, Par, M. III. pp. 44-45) gives another list which differs in some respects from the above. In the Nalandā copperplate of Devapāladeva (E. I vol.

Badandadašāparādhaḥ! (E. I. vol. III p. 53 at p. 56, Torkhede plate of Govinda in sake 735, and E. 1 vol. III p. 263, 266, the Rajor inscription of Mathanadeva dated Vikrama samvat 1016). It is not correct to hold that the words refer to the right of the donee to be exempt from guilt arising from the commission of some traditional offences or that authority was conferred by the grant on the donee to deal with offenders committing the ten aparādhas and to recover the fines imposed by themselves (as suggested in J BORS for 1916 p. 53n). No king would ever think of exempting donees in pious gifts or the villages in those grants from the results of such grave aparādhas as the murder of a woman, adultery, theft and abortion, nor is it possible to hold that a king authorised a private individual or individuals to exercise judicial power in such crimes as murder when (as we shall see later on) the power of dealing with sāhasa was not conferred on sreni or gana tribunals. The real meaning appears to be that the fines levied by him for the commission of the aparādhas in the villages granted would be made over to the donees as part of the gift, when recovered by the king. The 22 vadas were called padas of the king to distinguish them from the vyavahārapadas. According to Pitāmaha 342 they are: ripping open an animal's body (with a sharp weapon), destruction of growing crops, incendiarism, rape of a maiden, concealment of treasure trove, making a breach in an embankment or thorny hedge, grazing cattle over the field of another, destruction of a public garden, poisoning, high treason, unauthorised break ing of the royal seal, divulging the secret line of policy of the king, releasing from jail a prisoner, appropriation of the taxes or fines to be levied by the king ( these are two), appropriating gifts (made by the king) or the utseka

The fifty chalas were mostly breaches of etiquette before the eyes or in the presence of the king. According to Pitamaha they are: obstructing the road, raising the hand threateningly, leaping over a fort-wall ( without permission or reason ), destroying a cistern, destroying a temple, filling up a ditch ( dug round a fort ), divulging the weak points of the king (to the enemy), unauthorized entrance into the harem or royal chamber or the treasury or the royal kitchen (these are four), prying when the king is taking his meals, voiding ordure or urinating or blowing the nose or passing wind in the presence of the king ( these are four ), to sit before the king on haunches (paryankāsana), to occupy the foremost seat in the king's presence, to enter royal presence in a dress more resplendent than the king's or supported by another or by the wrong-daer or at an improper time (these are four), to lie down on the bed or seat of the king or to put on his shoes ( these are three ), to go near the king (unoalled) when the latter is lying down on his bed, to serve the king's enemies, to occupy a seat that is not offered, to use gold in the dress or ornaments (these are two), to take tāmbüla (from the king's betel box ) and chewing it ( this is one ), to speak loudly without being asked (by the king ), to run down the king, to wear only one garment, to appear before the king with oil on the hair, to untie the hair ( before him ), to cover one's face, to have a body painted with figures, to wear a garland, to shake one's garment, to cover the head, to be bent on finding the weak points of the king, to be thick with evil men (or to touch the king ), to have dishevelled hair, pointing out the nose, the bars and the eyes ( these are three ), to pick the teeth, to cleanse the ear or the nose ( these are two). As the list of chalas is a very long one the verses are not quoted below, but are given in the Appendix (note 34% a). Sukra (IV, 5.73-88 ) quotes all the verses from Narada and Pitāmaha on the aparādhas, padas and chalas and in III, 6 also gives a list of ten sins, which is different from that of the aparādhas.

divide the vyavahārapadas into civil and criminal. They more or less deal with most of the subjects brought out in modern classifications but not in an orderly manner They also divide laws into substantive and adjeotive or procedural. The vyava harapadas correspond to the former and the rules about procedure, the appointment of Judges and the constitution of courts, evidence and limitation are adjective law. Some of these are dealt with in the commentaries and digests under a section called vyavahāramātīkā (the elements of judicial proce dure ) and the rules of evidence are stated in Yāj., Nār, and others under the vyavahārapada ļņādāna once alone. It would be more convenient to deal with adjective law first. That law is now of antiquarian or academic interest only and will there fore be treated somewhat briefly. The smrtis lay down a high level of judicial procedure, but the procedure must have been modified to suit the requirements of different times and the resources and inclinations of different kings. Some of the vyavahārapadas viz. mnādana ( recovery of debt ), strīpunsayoga and dāyabhāga (partition of heritage) are of great practical importance even now, as all Hindus are governed in matters of partition, inheritance, debts, marriage and sonship by the rules of Hindu Law gathered from the Smộtis and digests as modified by legislative enactments and judicial decisions. For descrip tion of Judicial administration in the Buddhist texts and times, vide Fick pp. 107, 111-112 ( which show that the administration of justice in Vesāli, the capital of the Licchavis, was a complicated affair, one of the courts being that of the atthakulakas i. e, of eight heads of families ), Jayaswal's 'Hindu Polity', part II pp. 156-157, Hiouen Thsang's account in Beal's B.R. W.W. Vol. I. pp. 84-85; and Bombay Gazetteer, Vol. 24 pp. 266-267 (for the administration of Justice under the Marathas ). 

Justice was to be primarily dispensed by the king. He was an original court as well as an appellate tribunal. Smrtis and digests insist that the king cannot dispense justice by him self alone, but must do so with the help and guidance of others. Manu VIII 1-2 and Y&j. II. 1 provide that the king wearing no gaudy dress or ornaments is to enter the sabha (the Hall of Justice ) for looking into the causes of litigants, accompanied by learned brāhmaṇas and ministers proficient in statecraft, is to be free from hot temper and greed and decide according to the law laid down in dharmaśāstras. Kāt. (55-56 quoted in V. M. p. 278, Mft. Op Yāj. II. 2) says the same thing and adds that 

Justice, the king's conceitinh

a king who examines disputes in the presence of the Judge, the ministers, learned brāhmaṇas, the purohita and the sabhyas attains heaven. Vide Sukra IV. 5. 5 to the same effect (taking half verses from Yāj. and Kāt.). The king was not to decide by himself but was to follow the advice of his judge, though the responsibility even when he took advice was the king's. Vide Sukra IV, 5.6 (naikah pasyecca kāryāni). Nār. I. 35 says that the king has to abide by the view of the judge (prāduiva kamate sthitah). This sentiment that it is not safe for a single man, however clever he may be, to undertake to decide a dispute was so ingrained among all people that Kālidāsa gives expres sion to it in the Mālavikāgnimitra (Act I) when he pens the sentence 'sarvajñasyāpyekākino nirpayābhyupagamo doşaya'. In Raghuvamsa 17.39, Kālidāsa states that king Atithi always looked into the causes of people himself with the help of judges (dharmastha) 34. Pitamaha 345 states that a person even if he knows the rules (of dharma) should not give a decision single handed. Justice was to be dispensed openly in the court and not secretly. Sukra (IV. 5. 6-7) states 346 that neither the king nor the judge nor the sabhyas were to hear a cause in secret and that there were five reasons that led to the charge of partiality in judges viz. hot temper, greed, threats, enmity and hearing disputes in private. Judicial action is divisible into two pro vinces, viz. that of law and that of fact. The latter is a field in which it is impossible to lay down rules for determination. On points of facts there was a vast scope for the king's or judge's discretion. And therefore the texts contented themselves by saying that the king or judge should keep an open or impartial mind, should be free from hot temper or greed, should hear causes under the glare of public view and should not decide at his own will alone but with the help of learned brāhmanas and sabhyas. As regards points of law the king or judge is

required to decide according to the rules of dharmasastra (Manu VII. 3., Yāj. II. 1, Nār. I. 37, Sukra IV. 5. 11) and where there are no texts the king should decide in accordance with the re cognized custom of the country. Kāt. solemnly warns 34? the king against legislating or deciding according to his own will in the face of the texts: “If a king decides (a case) by his own fiat where there is a text (of the śāstra applicable to it) it leads him away from heaven, it causes ruin to the people, it brings danger ( to the king ) from the armies of his foes and it strikes down the roots of (long) life; therefore a king should decide the causes of people according to the rules of śāstra ; but in the absence of smrti texts he should carry out (judicial adminis tration) according to the usages (lit. the views) of the country'. These are the same as Sukra (V. 5. 10-11). Kāt. further pres cribes that the usages established in a country by the approval of its people and that are not in direct conflict with Veda and Smrtis should be recorded in writing under the seal of the king. Pitamaha 348 quoted by the Sm. O. (II. p. 26) states that in certain cases it is the king's own mind that is the deciding 

factor. 

How the king directly dispensed justice is illustrated by the rules of Gaut. XII. 40-42 and Manu VIII. 314-316 that a thief who has stolen a brāhmaṇa's gold may run with dishevelled hair to the king carrying an iron club or a heavy bludgeon of khadira wood, may declare the sin committed by him and request the king to award punishment, that the king may then strike him with the club and that whether the thief dies or lives after the king so strikes him he becomes free from the guilt. The king was also the highest court of appeal. The Rājatarangini (VI. 14-41) states how king Yasaskara heard the appeal of a person who had sold his house without the well, who on returning

from a long absence abroad found the well usurped by the vendee and was defeated in the lower courts because the vendee had bribed the scribe to write 'kūpasahita' instead of'ktiparahita' and how the king decided in the man's favour by exposing the vendee with a trick; while in VI. 42-69 the same king is said to have reversed another decision about a contract by a man whose 100 coins had fallen into a well. The same work in another place (IV. 82-108) states how a brāhmaṇa wife appealed to the king of Kashmir to find out the culprit who had murdered her husband in his sleep and how the king by superhuman means held a sorcerer to be the murderer. 

When owing to pressure of other weighty business the king cannot attend to the work of administering justice, the king should appoint a learned brāhmana together with three sabhyas to decide the disputes of people. Vide Manu VIII. 9-10, Yāj. II. 3, Kāt. 63 349 (same as Sukra IV. 5. 12). The qualifica tions of a judge are set out in many places. Ap. 350 Dh. S. II. 11. 29. 5 prescribes that in law-suits judges shall be endowed with learning, good family, and should be old, clever, and careful about dharma. Nār. requires : ' The Judge should be proficient in the texts on the eighteen titles of law, their 8000 sub-heads, in logic (ānvikşiki) and should be master of the Veda and Smộtis. Just as a physician takes out from the body an iron dart by the employ ment of surgical instruments, so a judge should extricate from a law-suit the deceit (underlying it)!. 351 Kāt. says that a judge should be restrained, born of a good family, impartial, not repellent (or harsh in his manners ), steady, afraid of the next world, highly religious, assiduous and free from hot temper. A fine enumeration of the qualities required in a judge is given in the ancient drama Mșcchakatika ( LX. 4). Vide Mānasollāsa

"R. p. 18), 352 or dharma pravaktr ( Manu VIII. 20) or dharmādhikarin (as in Manasollasa II. 2. verse 93). Pradvivāka is an ancient word. It occurs in Gaut. XIII. 26, 27 and 31, Nar.53 (I. 35), Brhaspati (q. by Apararka p. 602). The word is a combination of 'prad.' (one who puts questions to the suitors, from the root pracch ') and * vivāka' (who speaks out or analyses the truth, from the root * vac' with 'vi'). The derivation is given by Nār., Bphaspati, Kāt. 68 and others. The word 'praśnavivāka' (which is quite close to prād vivāka in sense and etymology ) goes very far into antiquity and occurs in Vāj. S. XXX. 10 and Tai. Br. IIJ. 5. 6. The existence of the word prādvivāka as early as Gautama (about 500 B.C.) and of prasnavivaka in the Vaj. S. and Tai. Br. clearly establishes that in anoient India judicial functions became separated very early from executive or political functions. 

The chief Judge was preferably to be a learned brāhmana (Manu VIII. 9, Yaj. II. 3). Kat. (67)354 and Sukra IV. 5.14 prescribe that, if a learned brāhmaṇa cannot be had for the post of the chief judge, then a kşatriya or a vaiśya who knows the

Who was to be a judge 

273 dharmasastras may be appointed, but the king should carefully avoid appointing a südra as a judge. Manu VIII. 20 says that the king may prefer a brāhmaṇa who is not learned and main tains himself by the more fact of his caste, but should never have a śūdra as the expounder of dharma and that the country whose king has a südra as judge to expound dharma comes to ruin as a cow sinks in mud. Vyāsa (q. in S. V. p. 65 ) is to the same effect. Manu (VII. 10-11), Yāj. (II. 3;), Nār. (II. 4) and Sukra IV. 5. 17 state that the king should appoint at least three sabhyas ( puisne judges or members of the court of justice ) to associate with the Chief Judge in the disposal of suits ( the idea being that three are the least number of sabhyas to be appointed). Kaut. (II. 1) prescribes that the courts called ' dharmasthiya' should be manned by three judges called dharmasthas who should possess the qualifications and status of amātyas and that such courts should be established on the borders of the provinces, for a group of ten villages ( sairahana), for a district ( dronamukha, 400 villages) and provinces ( sthaniya, 800 villages ). Bphaspati says 35 that the sabhyas may be seven, five or three. As in the case of the chief judge, the sabhyas should be preferably brāhmaṇas, but they may be ksatriyas or vaisyas. Manu ( VIII. 11 ) and Br. say that when in a sabhā three brāhmaṇas learned in the Vedas sit along with the chief judge appointed by the king that is like the sabha of Brahmā or it is like a sacrifice. Yāj. II. 2, Vişnudharmasūtra III. 74, Kāt. 57, Nār. III. 4-5, Sukra IV. 5. 16-17 and others require the following qualifications in the sabhyas: they should be endowed with the study of the Vedas, should know dharma šāstra, should speak the truth, should be impartial to friend or foe, should be steady, devoted to their work, intelligent, here ditary, proficient 356 in arthaśāstra. Impartiality in the king and the judges is insisted on in the texts. Vide Vas. 16. 3-5, Nār. (I. 34, III. 5). The king was not to appoint as sabhyas those who were ignorant of the usages of the country, who were atheists and devoid of the study of śāstras, who were either puffed up, hot-tempered, greedy or distressed (Br. g. in Sm.

History of Dharmaśāstra 

[Vol. 

II. p. 15). The chief justice (prādvivāka) with the sabhyas constituted the Court, being appointed ( niyulta) by the king. It was stated above that the king was to enter the Hall of Justice with the chief justice, sabhyas and brāhmaṇas. The distinction is that sabhyas were appointed by the king as judges, while brāhmaņas were persons who were well-versed in dharmaśāstra, who could attend the Court, though not appointed (aniyukta ) and whose opinions on difficult points of law were respectfully received by the judges. They (the learned brahmaņas ) were in the position of amicus curiæ, All and sundry were not to intermeddle in trials before the court, but only those who were learned in dharmaśāstra were allowed to express their opinions on knotty points. Vide 357 Mit. on Yāj. II. 2. Manu VIII. 12-14 ( same as Nār. III. 8-10 in a different order ) say that either a person should not enter a sabhā or if he enters should say what is proper, that a man remaining silent or declaring what is false becomes a sinner and that, where in spite of the opinion of some or all sabhyas, justice is not done by the king, they become participators in the king's guilt. Kāt. (74-78) makes it the duty of the sabhyas to bring round a king gradually to the right path when the king is about to start on the path of injustice and to state the true decision. 358 In the case of the brāhmaṇas their duty ends with stating the rule according to the śāstras; they have not, like the sabhyas, to prevent the king from doing the wrong thing or to bring him round to the path of right and justice. Nār. (III. 1) states elsewhere that one who is not appointed by the king should not interfere by his speech in the decision of a case and that if he does so he would be fined. This applies to the people that are present in the court to see the trial or that accompany the litigants.

mind of the litigants ). 360 The V. P. (p. 27 ) states, following Jaimini XII. 2. 22, that the opinion of the majority of sabhyas is to prevail. 36 According to Gaut. 362 XI. 25 as interpreted by Aparārka p. 599, if there is a difference of opinion among the judges, the king is to seek the advice of those who are learned in the three Vedas ( along with the other vidyās ) and decide the matter finally. Kāt. (58-59) states that the court of justice should have associated with the task of deciding disputes some merchants who belong to a guild, who are men of good family and character, of mature age, endowed with wealth and decent conduct and free from malice. The Mit. and Sm. C. say that this is done to placate the common people in the country. *3 This also shows the growing importance of the moneyed classes and of traders. In the Mrcchakatika a śreşthin and a kāyastha are associated with the Judge. 

The chief judge and the sabhyag364 were not to hold conver. sation in private with any one of the litigants while the suit was pending and if they did so they were liable to be fined (Kāt. 70). Kaut. IV. 9 prescribes fines and even corporal punishments for judges (dharmasthas) and pradestrs who corruptly give wrong decisions, cause loss or sentence to corporal punishment. If the sabhyas 365 give a decision, which is opposed to smrti and usage, through friendship, greed or fear, each was liable to be fined twice as much as the fine to be paid by the defeated party (Yaj. II. 4, Nar. I. 67, Kat, 79-80), The Visnu Dh. S. V. 180 and Br. prescribe banishment and forfeiture of all property for

sabhyas that give an unjust decision or take bribes. Kat. 81 prescribes that the loss caused by the fault of sabhyas must be made good by them to the losing party, but the decision given by them will stand 36, Sukra (IV.5, 63-64) prescribes the punish ment of a thief for a lekhaka (a scribe) taking down a different deposition from the one actually given or for a sabhya making use of such a deposition knowingly; IV.5.93 prescribes fine and removal from office if a sabhya gives a wrong decision through greed &c. and IV, 5. 282 prescribes a fine of 1000 panas against a judge giving a corrupt decision. There must have been a few cases of judges taking bribes in ancient India as in modern times (even Lord Bacon in the 17th century was found guilty of taking bribes as Lord Chancellor and confessed his guilt). In the Dašakumāracarita 367 (VIII. p. 131) the cynical jester Vihārabhadra says to his king that judges decide matters just as they please after taking bribes and the king thereby incurs in famy and the sin of doing injustice. It was believed that when & just decision was given, the king and the sabhyas became free from sin, the sin reaches him only who is guilty (whether plaintiff or defendant); but where an unjust decision is rendered & quarter of the sin falls on the litigant (plaintiff or defendant) who is guilty of adharma, one quarter each on the witnesses, the Babhyas and the king. The Baud. Dh. S. 1.'10. 30-31, Manu VIII. 18-19, Nār. (III. 12-13) have the same two verses. The Vyava hāratattva (p. 200) says that Hārīta also had the same verses. In the Mattavilāsa-prahasana (pp. 23-24) reference is made to the giving of bribes to the presiding officers of courts ( we should read adhikarana-karanikānām' instead of '-- kāruņikānām). Kaut. IV, 4 makes it a duty of the samāhartto employ spies in various disguises to test the honesty of judges (dharmasthas) and magistrates (pradeştrs) and, if they were found to be ready to succumb to bribes, to order their banishment. 

As to sabhā, vide pp. 92-93 above. The Nirukta (III. 5) in explaining Rg. I. 124. 7 (gartārug-iva sanaye dhanānām) states that gartā means a wooden board or stump in a sabhā on which a sonless widow claiming her husband's wealth had to stand when claiming it.

Different courts of justice 

277 

A court of justice was (acc. to Br. 368) of four kinds, viz. one established (pratişthitā) in a fixed place such as a town, apratişthita (not fixed in one place, but moving from place to place as on a circuit), mudritā (the court of a judge appointed by the king, who is authorised to use the royal seal), sāsitā (or śāstritā, acc. to S. V. p. 68 and Par. M. III. p. 24) i. e. the court in which the king himself presides. The Court of justice ( in the capital) was to be to the east of the palace as stated by Sankha and Bp. (in Sm, C. II. p. 19) and was to face the east. The court-house should be decorated 369 with flowers, statues, paintings, idols of gods and should be furnished with incense, throne or seat (for the king or judge), seeds, fire and water (Br. in Sm. C. II. p. 19). The sabhā was also called, as stated above, dharmadhikarana or simply adhikaraña (in Mrcchakatika IX and the Kādambarī, para 85 ) or dharmasthana or dharmāsana or sadas (Vas. 16.2). The Kādambari (para 85 ) speaks of the royal palace as having a court of justice where the judges (dharmādhikārins ) sat on high cane seats. The time for holding the court is the morning, aco. to Manu VII. 145, Yāj. I. 327. Kaut. states that the king 370 should look into the disputes of people in the 2nd part of the day divided into eight parts. The Dasakumāracarita (note 367 above) shows the same thing. Kāt. (61-62) prescribes that the time for holding the court as laid down in the sāstras is three parts of the day after the first part (when the day is divided into eight parts) i. e. from 7-30 A. M. to noon. There were holidays on which courts were closed i. e. on 8th and 14th tithis, Full Moon day and the amāvāsyā of every month (Samvarta acc. to Par. M. III. p. 23, Harita, acc. to S. V. p. 72). The sabhā is said to have ten angas

by Br. 371 viz, the king, the chief judge appointed by him, the sabhyas, smrti, gañaka (accountant), lekbaka (the scribe), gold, fire, water and svapuruşa (a bailiff, otherwise called sādhyapāla). The chief judge declares (the law), the king awards punishment, the sabhyas examine the dispute, smrti ( dharmaśāstra ) lays down the rule of decision, the success (of one party or the other) and the punishment; gold and fire are required for taking oaths, the water is for men when they feel thirsty, the ganaka counts the wealth or subject matter of dispute, the scribe writes down the pleadings, depositions and the decision, the puruşa summons the sabhyas, the defendant, the witnesses and he guards the complainant and the defendant when they have furnished no surety (for appearance ). It is further said that of these ten angas (limbs) the king is the head, the judge the mouth &c. Acc. to Bř. (q. in Par. M. III. p. 30) and Sukra IV.5. 43 the accountant and the scribe were to be proficient in grammar, lexicography and counting, were to be pure (in character) and conversant with several alphabets. Puruşa was called sādhyapāla, who was to be hereditary, strongly built, a śūdra and obedient to the sabhyas (Vyāsa in Par. M. III. p. 30, V. P. p. 31). The ten angas enumerated above (viz. king &c.) are respectively iden tified with the head, the mouth, the arms, the hands, the thighs (ganaka and lekhaka), the two eyes (gold and water), the heart, feet (Bộ. in V. P. p. 31, Hārita in Rāj. R. p. 20). In the Hall of Justice the king faces the east, the sabhyas, the accountant and the scribe respectively face the north, the west and the south (Bș, in Par. M. II. p. 35, Vyavahārasāra p. 25). Omitting the king and the chief judge the sabhā is said to have eight angas in certain works (e. g. 8. V. p. 72). The chief justice, the sabhyas and the learned brāhmaṇas were probably elderly people, as great emphasis is laid on this by Nār. (II. 18) and Udyogaparva 35.58 'that is not a real sabhā where there are no elderly men &c. ' 372.

Judicial procedure in Mşcchakațika 

279 

: In the drama Mrochakatika (Act IX) we have a graphic, though brief, description of judicial procedure in ancient India. That drama is at least as old as the 4th or 5th century A. D. It is very instructive to compare the procedure described in it with that gathered from Nār., Bộ. and Kāt. who constitute the leading triumvirate on law and procedure in the smstis and who prou bably flourished a little before and a little after the drama. It will be found on comparison that the procedure in the drama is in essentials the same as that of the three smrtis mentioned above, though there is some difference in minor details. The principal points in the drama bearing on judicial administration may be brought together here at one place. The court house was called 'adhikarana'; the chief judge was called adhikara nika; he was assisted by the śreşthin (a prominent merchant or banker) and a kāyastha; all three are referred to as ' adhikaraṇabhojaka' and are addressed as adhikȚta or niyukta ( appointed by the king); when a despot was on the throne, the judge's position was precarious and he could be deprived of the post at the king's sweet will the Sakāra, king's brother-in-law, threatens the chief justice with summary dismissal ). There was a servant who arranged the seats in the court, inquired whether there was any litigant, summoned Vasantasenā's mother and Cārudatta ( this man corresponds to the puruşa or sādhyapāla ); inquiry was made by the judges as to whether any one wanted to file a suit or complaint; the śreşthin and kāyastha are asked by the presiding judge to write down the important parts of the complainant's statement; a private person (who was not a relativo) could complain to the court about an alleged murder; the judge allowed an old person like the mother of Vasantasenā and a respectable and well-known citizen like Cārudatta to occupy a seat when replying to questions from the court, but Cārudatta. was deprived of this concession when a prima facie case was made out against him; the court-house (being probably situated near the palace ) had near it mantrins, dūtas, spies, an elephant and a horse (and the chief of the city police is asked to ride the horse and find out whether the corpse of a woman lay in the public garden), and kayasthas ; Cārudatta was called upon to state the truth and the judge tells him that in the court no trick ( chala) will be allowed to pass ; 373 when a strong case was

made out against Cārudatta by circumstantial evidence he was asked to confess his guilt, otherwise he was told that he would be whipped (i. e. this refers to whipping to extort a confession, vide above note 332 ); the judge was only to pronounce the judgment and recommend the legal punishment, while the king had the last word about the exact punishment; Manu's work. was an authority; a brāhmana offender was not to be sentenced to death, but was to be banished with all his wealth, though some kings did not act up to this rule; impalement was carried out by cāņdālas; ordeals of fire, water, poison and balance were known and Sūdraka conveys (vişasalilatulāgniprārthite me vicare) that Cārudatta had prayed for trial by ordeal, but that the chief justice, because there were witnesses and circumstantial evi. dence, refused that request. 

The court 80 far described (i. e. where the king or the chief justice appointed by him presided) was the highest court, But other tribunals were recognized in the smộtis and digests, Yāj. I. 30 and Nār. (1. 7) state 374 that law-suits may be decided by village councils ( kulāni), corporations (śreni), assemblies (pūga in Yāj., gana in Nār.), the judges appointed by the king and the king himself, each later one being superior to each preceding one. The first three were practically arbitration tribunals like the modern panchayats. The several words here require explanation and they have been differently interpreted by different digests. Medhātithi on Manu VIII. 2 explains these words at great length. Acc. to him 'kulani' means' group of relatives' and also (acc. to some ) 'impartial persons' (madhyasthapuruşāḥ) and 'gana' means 'builders of houses and mansions or brāhmaṇas dwelling in mathas'. Acc. to the Mit. and V. P. p. 29 'kulāni' means 'an assembly of the rela tions, agnatic and cognatic, of the litigants'; acc. to the Sm. C. it means 'the agnates of the parties '; acc. to Aparārka it means 'husbandmen'. It appears likely that 'kulāni' means officers who presided over a group of eight or ten villages and who were granted the produce of one kula of land as their salary. Vide Manu VII, 119 and Kullūka thereon and Dāmodar pur plate of Gupta year 124 in which the head of the district (vişayapati) is said to have been assisted by the nagaraśreşthin, prathama-kulika and prathama-kāyastha (E. I. 15 p. 130) and

'grāmāsta-kul adhikaranam' in E. I. vol. 17 p. 345 at p. 348 in the reign of Ku māragupta I. From the Sanchi stone Inscription of Chandragupta II ( of the Gupta year 93 i. e. 412–13 A. D.) it appears that panchayats were called 'pañcamandali' (Gupta Inscriptions pp. 29, 31). Śreni' means, acc, to most commenta tors, 'the corporation of persons following the same craft or avocation, though they may belong to different castes' such as horse-dealers, betel-leaf sellers, weavers and dealers in hide. Aco, to the V. M. p. 280, 'śreņi' is an association of artisans or traders'. "Pūgas' are assemblies of men of one place (a village or a town) belonging to different castes and following different avocations. Kāt. (225 and 682 ) distinguishes between gana and pūga which he respectively defines as assembly of families' (kulas) (Sm. C. II. p. 18, Par. M. III. p. 352) and assemblies of traders and the like’(V. R. p. 668). V. P. p. 30 says gana and pūga are synonyms. The king was thus the highest court of appeal and next to him was the court of the judges appointed by him. Bphaspati (S. B. E, vol. 33 p. 281 verse 28) ordains 375 that the kulas, śreñis and gañas that are well-known to the king may decide the disputes of litigants except those that fall under sāhasa and that it was only the king who could carry out the order for fines or corporal punishments, i. e. the arbitration courts could only decide disputes not involving sāhasa and they had no power to execute their decrees about fines and corporal punishments, but that their decisions had to be filed with the king, who, if he did not disapprove of them, put them into execu tion. Pitāmaha 376 appears to mention three classes of State courts, while Yāj. and Nār. refer only to two (viz. that of the chief justice and that of the king himself): 'a dispute decided in a village may be taken to the city and one examined in the city (court) to the king; a dispute decided by the king whether correctly or incorrectly cannot be reviewed.' It is distinotly

provided by Br.37 (S. B. E. vol. 33 p. 282 verse 31) that the sabhyas are superior to the kulas and the rest, the chief justice is superior to sabhyas and the king is superior to all. Pitāmaha3774 provides that when a litigant is not satisfied with the decision given by a kula tribunal or the others, he can carry the matter by way of appeal to the king. Besides these courts it appears from 

Kautilya that the village headman ( grūmika or grāmakūta ) exercised certain summary powers such as driving out of the village a thief or an adulterer (III. 10) and that he could try some offences (IV. 4, grāmakūtamadhyakşam vā satri brūyat &c.). Even in the 20th century in the Bombay Presidency under the Village Police Act (Bombay Act VIII of 1867 ) the village head man (called Police Patil) has the authority to try and on con viction to punish with confinement for a period not exceeding twenty-four hours any person charged with the commission of petty assault or abuse within the limits of a village and the person convicted has no right of appeal to any court or magis. trate against such conviction and only the High Court has the power to entertain a petition for revision ( which it hardly ever does). Bhrgus18 quoted in Sm. C. II. p. 18 and other digests says that there are ten tribunals common to all men viz. the village people, the assembly of the citizens of the capital, gana, śrepi, men learned in the four vedas (or vidyās viz. ānyikşiki and the rest), the vargins, kulas, kulikas, judges (appointed by

the king) and the king himself. The vargins 379 are the groups of various kinds such as ganas, pūgas, vrātas, śrenis and others. Kulikas may be the elders of the families of the plaintiff and the defendant. In the Dāmodarpur plates (E. I. 15 p. 130 ) we come across one Dhrtimitra who is described as 'prathamakulika'. The word 'pañcakula' was applied to certain high officers in Gujarat and Kathiawad; vide I. A, vol. 11 p. 220 (Abu Ins. of Bhimadeva dated Vikrama year 1265) and Tawney's translation of the Prabandha-cintamani pp. 18, 84, 129, 149, 190 for ' pañca kula'. The provisions about the conflict between customs and usages on the one hand and śruti and smrti on the other will be dealt with in detail later on in another section. A few words may be said here about conflicts between smstis. In disputes between residents of the same country, the same city or the same hamlet of cowherds or of the same capital or village, the decision should be according to their own conventional usages, but in disputes between these and others (who are not residents of those respective places) the decision must be in accordance with the sacred texts 330 ( Kāt. 47 q. in S. V. p. 72, Par. M. III. P. 41). Another rule is that when there is an apparent conflict between two smrtis, reasoning is to decide in ordinary life which should be followed or reasoning based on the actions of the aged and the experienced is to decide what text to follow (Yāj. II. 21) and the business of the interpreter consists in holding that one of the smrtis contains a general rule and the other an exception or that the two apply to different sets of circumstances (vişaya vyavasthā) or that an option may be intended. Voluminous glosses have been written on this one text of Yāj II. 21 right from Visvarüpa in the 9th century downwards. Another rule is that in the administration of justice dharmaśāstra rules have superior force to those of arthaśāstra. This has been already referred to above (p. 9).

agrooment and that the five tribunals for foresters and others are kulikas (high officers or heads of families ), sārthas (members of Caravans), headmen, villagers, citizens. The texts further provide that in certain cases the court was to call in aid outsiders to help in deciding disputes. Vyāsa 331 says: 'In the case of disputes among traders, artisans, husbandmen and actors it is impossible for others to give a (correct) decision; hence such matters should be got decided by experts in those various matters'. Bļ. states that in disputes among husbandmen, craftsmen (carpenters and the like), artisans (like painters), money-lenders, guilds, dancers, sectarians (like Pāśupatas) and criminal tribes the decision should be made with the help of those who understand the conventions made by them and their usages. In disputes about the boundaries of villages and about fields in a village, four, eight or ten neighbours were to settle the boundaries (vide Manu VIII. 258, Kaut. III, 9, Yāj. II. 150-152 ). Kaut. 1. 19 and Br. 342 (q. in V. P. p. 33) say that disputes between those who have performed austerities or between those who are adepts in witchcraft and Yoga should not be decided by the king (unaided), but with the help of those learned in the three Vedas, as otherwise they may feel offended. These quotations show that certain people could claim to be tried by their peers or at least by a jury. This jury system was resorted to for settling complicated questions of fact. It is a very ancient systein, being mentioned even by Gautama 383 XI. 21-22 'the king, having received help from the heads of husbandmen, merchants, cow. herds, money-lenders and artisans as regards disputes in their own groups, should finally decide what is just'. 

It has already been stated above that the king is to decide according to the smrtis. He has also to take into consideration the duties and usages of the several varnas and the eighteen low

castes 34 (acc. to Manu VIII. 41 and Harita ). The eighteen low castes said to be outside the pale of the four varnas and āsramas are enumerated by Pitāmaha, viz. washerman, shoe-maker, nata (dancer caste ), bamboo-worker, fisherman, mleccha, bhilla. abhira, mātanga and nine others (the names of which are not given here as the text is corrupt ). 

The foregoing gradations of tribunals did not all exist at all times in ancient and medieval India. One thing is, however, quite clear. There was always a court of the Chief Justice appointed by the ruling power and final appeal lay to the ruler himself. But as regards inferior tribunals usage varied. For example, it appears from a decision of 1742 in which a ruling of king Shivaji about a Kulkarni vatan is set out that in Shivaji's time disputes could be taken before three different but inferior tribunals, viz, the got ( i. e. the assembly of castemen ) which is somewhat like the kula tribunal of the smrtis, or before arbi trators hailing from a place other than where the dispute took place or before the officers, balutedars and chief men of several villages round about. 385 

Manu (VIII. 23) prescribes that the king fully dressed and with an undisturbed mind, after taking his seat in the Hall of Justice, should perform obeisance to the gods, the guardians of the ( eight) quarters (Indra and others, as specified in Manu VII. 4) and should then commence the work of looking into the legal business. The transaction of legal business has four stages (from the king's or judge's point of view ) viz. first receiving information from a person, then finding out under what title of law ( vyavahārapada) the information falls, then consideration of the pleadings of the parties and the evidence

led by them and lastly the decision.386 When a litigant comes before the court at a proper time (i. e, when the court is sitting) and makes his bow, he (the king or judge ) should 37 address him as follows:- What is your business? What is the injury done to you? Don't be afraid, speak out, man! By whom, when, where and why (was the injury caused ) ? When thus asked whatever he replies should be considered by the judge ) with the sabhyas and brāhmaṇas and if the matter be legally entertainable he ( the judge ) should deliver the seal (sealed order) to the plaintiff or order the bailiff to summon (the defendant)". These observations are made by Kat. (86-88). Whatever & man, being excited by one of the emotions of love (or anger or greed ), says before the court, should be first written down on a board or the like by the scribe ( Nār. 308 II. 18). 

Very elaborate rules are laid down about the summoning of the defendant or accused by Nār. (I 52-54), Br, Kāt. ( 96-100), Sukra (IV, 5-102-106 ) and others. A few of the rules are bet out below. The first person to be summoned is the one against whom a complaint based on suspicion or truth is made by the plaintiff or complainant. But other persons may be called as defendants 19 either when the person proceeded against by the plaintiff puts forward another as liable to plaintiff's claim or makes another liable along with himself or when another person is accepted by the plaintiff (on behalf of another who is a minor &c.) or (acc. to the Madanaratna ) another person himself comes forward (as defendant). The king should not require the personal appearance of the following persons: the diseased, minors, very old ( beyond 70), one in a calamity, one engaged in some

Nār. (1. 53 ) prescribes that cowherds when it is the season for taking cows for grazing, agriculturists in the sowing season, artisans actually engaged in work and soldiers engaged 390a in war should not be summoned to appear in person, while so engaged. In these cases some one on their behalf should be summoned as a representative. But it is provided that even these persons may be summoned with proper safeguards in important cases or grave charges, such as the killing of human beings, theft, rape, eating forbidden food, counterfeiting coins, high treason &c. But women who by their earnings support their families, unchaste women, prosti tutes, women without family and women excommunicated for grave sins may be summoned to appear personally 39. A. person who is summoned and is able to appear but does not appear in person was to be fined according to the value or importance of the subject matter of dispute e. g. in slight causes fifty (copper) panas, two hundred at least in the cases of middling value and 500 panas at least in heavy causes (vide Kāt. 100-101 quoted by Sm. C. II. p 34, Aparārka p. 607.) After taking the fine and waiting for 30 days or a month and a half the king may give a judgment in favour of the plaintiff, due to defendant's default. But if the defendant does come after that time, the suit may be restored and proceeded with. 392 But when there is an invasion by an enemy or a famine or an epidemic or disease the king should not impose a fine, but send a second summons. In the case of those who are exempted from personal appearance ( as above) their relatives (son, father &c.) or some other person

appointed by them (such as a pupil, servant &c.) or one who can be recognised as their agent may be allowed to appear. 39 But no representative was allowed in serious charges cited above (vide Kāt. 93-95 q. by Aparārka p. 639, Sm. C. II. p. 34). If a father, brother, a friend, or a relative appears before the court for the real litigant, the law-buit may be proceeded with (Pitāmaha). Whoever carries on anything through another by appointing him to that task should be understood to have done it himself and the business transacted by such a representative or agent cannot be annulled. If a person who is not a brother nor father nor son nor appointed to represent another prosecutes a law suit for another, he is liable to be fined 393. As the king was supposed to be the guardian of a minor's wealth, it appears from this that a king could have appointed a guardian for the suit when a minor was concerned. The above provisions show that maintenance and champerty were not encouraged by ancient Hindu lawyers. 

An interesting question arises whether lawyers as an institution existed in ancient India. The answer must be that so far as the smrtis are concerned, there is nothing to show that any class of persons whose profession was the same as that of modern counsel, solicitors or legal practitioners and who were regulated by the State existed. This does not preclude the idea that persons well-versed in the law of the smrtis and the pro cedure of the courts were appointed ( niyıkta) to represent a party and place his case before the court. The procedure prescribed by Nār, Bs. and Kāt. reaches a very high level of technicalities and skilled help must often have been required in litigation. In the com. of Asahāya as edited by Kalyāṇabhatta on Nār. (reādāna 4) there is an instructive story from which it appears that persons who had studied the smrtis helped parties in return for a monetary consideration to raise contentions

before the court. But there also the helper comes forward saying that he is a very old friend of the family and has been appointed by the party to represent him. So he corresponded to what is called a recognized agent in the Indian Civil Pro. Code, Order III. r. 2 (Act 1 of 1908). In Sukra IV. 5. 114-117 some important rules are given :34 the person who is appointed to represent a party should get as his wages 1/16, 1/20, 1/40, 1/80 or 1/160 part of the amount in dispute, that the wages become less and less as the claim in dispute becomes higher or if several persons employ one representative; one who knows dharmaśāstra and the procedure of law-guits should be appointed as representative and not any one who is deficient in these; if the representative takes wages without knowing these he should be punished by the king. A representative is to be appointed by the party and not by the king at his will; if the representa tive allows the matter entrusted to him to fail owing to his greed he is liable to be fined 395, In the 'Questions of Milinda' (S.

When one month passed Devadbara paid as interest 200 drammas. When the 2nd montb was running. Devadbara died of high fever, his son died of cholera and only the great-grandson of Devadhara, by name Mahidhara, remained. He was a very young man addicted to gamba ling and other vices. His property was taken under their protection by his maternal uncles. They were advised by a brāhmaṇa who had a smattering of smrti lore and was called Smārtadurdhara 'Don't pay even a rupec to the creditor Sridhara. I shall save you even ia Court by citing appropriate texts.' The uncles replied if you save us, we shall give you a thousand drammas as a reward', When the 2nd month passed (from the date of borrowing), Sridhara called upon the uncles to pay 200 drammas as interest for the 2nd month. They replied *You cannot claim even the priacipal (from the great-grandson of the original borrower), much less interest'. Smārtadurdhara, the legal adviser of the uncles, said "Nārada declares (rņādāna 4) 'grandsons should pay the debts of the grandfatber; that (debt) ceases from the fourth'. On hearing this Sridhara was stunned, but gathering his wits filed a suit in the court and had summonses issued

E. vol. 36 p. 238 ) there is a passage about certain bhikkhus in the city of Righteousness' (dhammanugara) who are styled * dhammāpanikas' (dealers in dharma) and are described as follows: '(Bhikkhus), who in the spirit and the letter, in its arguments and explanations, its reasons and examples teach and repeat, utter forth and recapitulate the ninefold word of the Buddha; such bhikkhus are called, o king, lawyers in the blessed one's city of Righteousness' and on p. 239 there are 

dhammasetthino '(bankers of dharma), which word reminds us of the śreşthin in the Mșcchakatika. The dhammāpapikas probably correspond to such lawyers as Smārtadurdhara mentioned above. The rules of Sukra make a near approach to the modern institution of the Bar and the fees prescribed by Sukra are similar to those allowed by the Bombay Regulation II'of 1827 and by Schedule III to the Bombay Pleaders' Act (Bombay Act XVII of 1920). The first legislative enactment in India to deal with lawyers for representing parties passed by the British Government was the Bengal Regulation VII of 1793 which defin ed the privileges, the fees (five per cent up to 1000 and then on a sliding scale) and responsibilities of vakeels (which word originally means 'agent'). 

The plaintiff may put, under restraint till the approach of the summoner (the bailiff) by the king's order the defendant, who does not stand up to meet the claim (i. e. is about to abscond or may abscond) that is to be investigated (or when the plaintiff spoke to him about the claim before coming to court) and 

(Continued from the last page) to Mabidhara,' great-grandson of Devadbara, and his uncles. Sureties were taken from both sides. The uncles were asked (by the court) 'why don't you pay the interest to Sridhara'? They appointed as their representative Smārtadurdhara, who said that he and his ancestors were friends of the family of Mabidhara and so be addressed the court 'I rely on Nārada's words (quoted above), and Mabidhara being the fourth from Devadhara (including the latter) is not liable to pay'. Bhatta Smārtasekbara laughed at this and said 'Smārtadurdhara, you are not deeply learned in the smrti texts por have you studied glosses thereon. The whole of the debt of 10000 drammas lent by Sridhara is still due from Mabidhara, as he is the great-grandson of the borrower, as three male descendants of the borrower are liable to pay the ancestor's debt and as Nārada means only this that the son of the great grandson (who is the fourth from the borrower, excluding the latter from 'computation) is not liable to pay the debt of his great-great-grand-father' and the learned speaker charged bim with having been promised a gratifica tion, Smārtadurdhara and his proteges lost the case.

Nature of asedha 

291 

who disregards the words of the claimant. This is called asedha which is explained by the Mit. on Yāj. II. 5 as restraint under the king's order. It is of four kinds viz, restraint as to (sthāna) place (e. g. you are not to go elsewhere from your house or a temple), as to time (e. g. you must present yourself on the 5th of a certain month), restraint from going on (pram vāsa) a journey (till the suit is decided) and restraint from doing certain actions (e. g. you are not to sell certain property or to plough a certain field till the disposal of the suit ) 396 The rules about āgedha are laid down by Nār. (I. 47-54), Br. (g. by V. P. p. 42, Sm. C. II. pp. 30-31), Kāt. 103-110 (all quoted by V. P. pp. 41-42, Sm. C. II. pp. 30-31). Nār. (I. 54) states that those persons whose personal appearance is dispensed with as stated above are not to be subjected to āsedha. Nārada provides that he who disregards the prohibitory order (āsedha ) of the court should be punished and that he who obtains a restraint order against a person that should not have been thus proceeded against should also be punished. Acc. to Kāt. that man who restrains the defendant 80 as to prevent him from exercising his limbs or from talking or breathing freely should be punished and not the defendant if he breaks such restraint. A defendant would not be liable to be fined, if he disregards a restraint order which ties him down to a river ford, or to a forest, to a bad place ( infested by thieves and tigers) or at the time of an invasion (Nār. 1. 49). There is a provision which looks like one for the appointment of a Receiver in modern times. Kāt. (120) says' A king should not allow a litigant to proceed if the litigant retains the property or money which he has (been shown to have) seized; it should be delivered over to the opposing litigant (if he be trustworthy) or it may be kept with a third person (as receiver for the successful party )39. When the defendant comes on being summoned, he and the plaintiff are both to be placed before the judges (Pitāmaha q. in Sm. C. II. p. 34). Then a surety is to be taken from both who would be capable of carrying 

396. It should be noted that these provisions about āsedha are analo gous to those about attachment or arrest before judgment (section 94 and Order 38 of the Indian Civil Pro. Code of 1908) and temporary injunction (Order 39 of the same).

out the decree made by the court i. e, who would be able to pay the amount of fine to the king if the defendant denied the plaintiff's claim or who would be able to pay double the amount of the claim if the plaintiff's claim be found to be false (Yaj, II. 10–11). If any one of the parties cannot offer a surety, then he has to be kept in the custody of the court's bailiff (sādhyapala) and has to pay the daily wages of the bailiff at the end of every 398 day ( Kāt. 117 q. by Mit. on Yāj. II. 10). The following persone could not be accepted as sureties ( Kāt. 114-116 d. by Mit. on Yāj. II. 57); ' the master (in the case of a party being a servant), an enemy, one authorised by the master, one arrested, one fined, one accused of grave sins or offences, one who is a co-sharer in family property, a friend, one who is a perpetual student, one who is appointed to do the king's business, ascetios, one who would not be able to pay the amount decreed and the fine to the king, one whose father is living, one who incites the party for whom surety is demanded, one whose antecedents are unknown.' When a person ( of any caste ) is kept guarded for want of a surety he is not to be prevented from doing necessary and obligatory acts (bath, sandhyā worship &c.) and if he runs away from the guard he should be fined eight paņas (Kat. 119 q. in Par. M. III. 58). 

When the defendant comes before the court, the information at first given by the plaintiff is to be written down accurately in his presence together with the year, month, fortnight, day, names (of parties ), caste &c. ( Yaj. II. 6). When the aggrioved party first comes to the court, all that is taken down is the matter in dispute (i. e. the draft of the plaint); when the defendant comes, the plaint is written down with all details (including the grievance as stated in the beginning ). 399 The plaint is called by various names in Sanskrit viz. pakşa, bhāṣā, pratijna ( Mit. on Yāj. II. 6). Sometimes the word 'pūrvapakşa' is used for paksa (as in Kāt. 131, Nār. II. 1). Vadin and prativādin generally mean the plaintiff and the defendant, though Vādin sometimes means 'a litigant' (either the plaintiff or defendant). * Arthin' (one who seeks the assistance of the court) and abhiyoktr (attacker) are synonyms of vādin, and pratyarthin and abhiyukta (attacked) are synonyms of prativādin.

Concerning plaints 

293 

( 130-131 ) says that the judge 400 should have the plaint written down on a board (or on the ground) with a piece of chalk as narrated naturally by the claimant and then on a leaf ( palm leaf or bark or paper ) when it is corrected ( after the defendant appears) and that the plaintiff may delete some matters from the original ( draft of) plaint and may fill in gaps and that such amendments may be made in the draft till the plaint is finally settled. 401 It appears from the Vyavahāratattva (p. 205) that the pleadings (the plaint and the reply) could be written down in Sanskrit or in the vernacular of the parties if they were ignorant. The Mșcchakatika (Act IX) shows how the presiding judge asks the sresthin and kayastha to write down the words 'not by me' as the complaint of the Sakāra when the latter averred that Vasantasenā was killed by Cārudatta and not by himself. The plaint could be amended till the filing of the reply 402 (Nār. II. 7). Elaborate rules are laid down about the contents of the plaint by many writers from Kautilya (III. 1) downwards. Kaut. 403 states that in the plaint should be entered the year, season, month, fortnight, day, the documents to be relied upon), the court (in which the plaint is lodged), the (amount of) debt (or other money due ) and the country, village, caste, family, names and occupations of the plaintiff and defendant together with the relationship in which they stood to each other. Kāt. (127-128 q. by Mit. on Yāj.

the dwelling place (of the parties ), the measure (so many nivartanus &c.), the name of the field, ( names of) the father, grandfather and great-grand-father, mention of the former kings. Kāt. 124-126, Br. (q. in Sm. C. p. 36 and V. M. P. 294 ) give further details, which are passed over for want of space. All the details enumerated above need not occur in every plaint, but the necessary ones must be stated according to the facts of each case 404, 

These rules about the contents of plaints are very similar to those in the Indian Civil Pro. Code, Order VII rules 1-5. 

In modern India no suit or appeal can be filed unless the plaintiff or appellant pays substantial court-fees (Rs. 71 per cent upto Rs. 1000 and 5 per cent for higher claims up to 5000 and so on at reduced rates as the claim rises). It is interesting to see how the litigants in ancient India fared in this respect. It appears that in disputes of a criminal nature no court fees had to be paid in ancient India. The person found guilty had to pay to the king the fine declared in the Smộtis for offences or awarded by the Court. As regards civil disputes also nothing had to be paid at the inception of the suit. Certain rules are prescribed by Kaut. (III. 1), Yāj., Vişņudharmasutra, Nār. and others about payments to the king after the suit is decided, which payments may be regarded as in the nature of court fees. Yāj. II. 42 and Vişnudharma sūtra VI. 20-21 state that in the case of suits for the recovery of debts the debtor who admitted that he was a debtor (but did not pay the creditor) should be made to pay to the king 10 per cent on the amount decreed and the successful creditor should pay five per cent out of the amount decreed ( as bhfti, compensa tion or court fee ) 405. When the debtor denies the fact of debt altogether and the creditor succeeds in establishing it, the debtor had to pay the amount decreed to the creditor and an equal amount to the king as fine; but if the plaintiff turns out to be a false claimant (i. e, the relationship and the amount of the debt are not proved) he had to pay to the king as fine twice as much as the amount claimed by him (Yāj. 11. 11). Nar. also (IV. 132 ) sayg $06 that a debtor, who is able to repay a debt but does not

do go through wickedness or malice, should be made to pay the debt after recovering five per cent from the debtor. The Sm, C. II. p. 121 says that this applies to a case where the debtor admits his liability to the plaintiff. Manu VIII. 139 gives milder rules: 'if a debtor admits before the Court that he is a debtor, then he has to pay a fine equal to five per cent on the amount decreed, but if he denied the fact of debt altogether, then he has to pay as fine ten per cent'. Manu VIII. 59 which prescribes a fine twice of that amount which the debtor falsely denies or which the creditor falsely claims contains a somewhat different rule (which Medhātithi says applies where parties are guilty of downright fraud, while VIII. 139 applies where there is negligence or loss of memory &c.). In suits other than for debts such fines are also prescribed e. g. in Yāj. II. 26 for one who misappropriates a pledge, II. 33, II. 188 (for breach of the rules of guilds and other groups), Yāj. II. 171 (where a person claiming to be the owner of lost goods and failing to prove his ownership of them was fined pañcu-bandha i. e, a fifth part of the price of the goods). Kaut prescribes 407 that when a party is guilty of contradictory pleadings, or does not cite witnesses though saying he has witnesses and is defeated for these and similar reasons he has to pay a fine of 20 per cent of the claim and 10 per cent only if he relied on his own deposition (and called no witnesses) and further the defeated party has to pay the costs viz. the wages of the bailiff and of the subsistence allowance of witnesses. Therefore it may be said that in ancient times Indian litigants had an easy time, while in modern times litigation is often ruinous, what with the heavy court fees to be paid in several courts, the fees of legal practi tioners and the expenses of witnesses and the delay of years 408. The remark of Dr. Hart (in 'Way to justice' p. 17) is as appli. cable to modern India as to England 'the plain truth is that the justice of the courts is unattainable by some citizens through want of the necessary financial resources; while in the case

of many others it is not worth having at the cost which it involves 

In one of his most famous soliloquies Shakespeare (in Hamlet III. 1 'Oppressor's wrong, the proud mans's contumely, the pangs of despised love, the law's delays') enumerates law's delays among the principal evils of human life. In modern India as in England 409 before 1873 delay in the decision of causes is a crying evil. In the rough and ready methods of administering justice in ancient India care seems to have been bestowed on disposing of cases as quickly as possible. The story of king Nřga who caused delay has already been referred to (p. 243). Kaut. (III. 1) states that if the plaintiff, after the defendant files his answer, does not on the same day begin to support his case (by evidence) he would be declared to be defeated, since the plaintiff comes to court after determining the strength of his case, but the defendant does not do so (he is dragged to the court); that the defendant may be allowed an adjournment of three or seven days for his defence ; if he is not ready with his defence within that time he may be punished with a fine ranging from 3 to 12 panas ; if he does not answer even after three fortnights he shall be punished with fine for parokta (viz, pancabandha or databandha as stated above in note 407) and the plaintiff's claim would be recovered from the property of the defendant. A similar rule is laid down in Manu VIII. 58. Yaj. II. 12 prescribes that disputes relating to sāhasa (killing by poison or weapon), theft, abuse, assault, cows, charges of grave sins and women ( about the chastity of all women and about ownership in the case of female slaves), the defendant has to make his defence at once, and that in other cases time may be granted at the discretion of the court. Nār. I. 45 is to the same effect. Nār. I. 44 holds that adjournments may be granted in suits about debts and the like for finding out the truth as such disputes are complicated and as memory is weak. Pitamaha (q. in Sm. C. II. p. 42) says that adjournments may be granted in disputes about deposits, sealed deposits, gifts, partnerships, transgression of conventions and partition of heritage. Gautama XIII. 28 speaks in general terms of an adjournment for one year, when the defendant does not remember the transaction, but prescribes immediate trial in

Adjournments 

297 

disputes about kine, women and children or when the matter is urgent i. e. where loss or abandonment of the thing will be the result of delay ( Gaut. XII. 29-30). Brhaspati allows time even to the plaintiff if he is not able to put forward his case owing to his immaturity or lack of boldness. 410 Kāt. (145-158 quoted by Aparārka p.619, Sm. C. II, p. 42, Par. M. III. pp. 69-72) contains elaborate rules about adjournments. He says that according to the importance or otherwise of the dispute, one, three, five, or seven days may be allowed to the defendant to make his defence in disputes about debts, according as the debt was contracted three months ago or 6, 12, 20 or 30 years ago; that even more than a year may be allowed if the defendant is an idiot or lunatic or is suffering from disease or if the subject of dispute or the witnesses are in a foreign country; that more adjournments than one may be granted in such cases; that according to Brhaspati in disputes about immoveable property also no adjournments should be granted; that if the act of God (daiva) or the king prevents the defendant from making his defence he should not be declared defeated, but time should be granted to him to prove this. It is clear that with the advance of time adjournments became longer and more frequent in Kat. compared with the rigid rules of Kaut.. Kat. and Sukra (IV.5. 167, 209 ) contain the last word on this point. According to them delay in deciding causes is tantamount 411 to denial of justice ( dharmavyāpatti, lit. death of Justice ). 

The sequence of stages in a law-suit is as follows: first the plaintiff makes his averments, then the defendant makes his reply; when both have finished, the members of the court speak (or deliberate among themselves) and after them (speaks) the judge ( Kāt. 121 g. by Apararka p. 611, Par. M. III. p. 58). The four stages (pādas ) of a law-suit, acc. to Yāj. II. 6-8, and

Bp. are named 412 bhūşūpāda (the plaint ), uttarapāda ( the reply ), kriyūpāda (the adducing of evidence), sādhyasiddhi 413 or nirnaya (the decision); while Kāt. 31 states them as pūrvapaksa, uttara, pratyākalita and kriyā. Pratyākalita means 'discussion or consideration among the sabhyas about the burden of proof'(vide p. 260 n. 337). If several persons come simultaneously with compla. ints or plaints, then the order of taking up the cases is regulated by the unirņui of the plaintiffs i. e. the suit of a brāhmana is first taken up (Manu VIII. 24). Kaut. I. 19 states 414 that the causes of temples (or idols ), ascetics, heretics, brāhmaṇas learned in the vedas, about cattle and sacred places, of minors, of the aged, of those afflicted with disease or misfortunes, of the helpless and of women are to be looked into in the order enumerated or according to the importance of the causes or their urgency. Kāt. ( 12% q. in Sm. C. II. p. 35, Par, M. III. p. 59 ) says that preference should be given to that litigant whose injury is greater or whose cause is more important than those of the rest. Kaut. IIL 20 went 415 so far as to say that judges should look into the causes of idols (or temples), brāhmaṇas, persons performing austerities, women, minors, the old, the diseased, the helpless, even if they did not come forward to complain nor should judges put forward the excuses of time (i. e. the long delay in taking cognisance of their causes), place, or (long) enjoyment (of their opponents ).

II. 6, Par. M. III. 61 ). Nār. II. 8 also points out the faults ( dosas ) of a plaint and explains them (II. 9-14). Bșhaspati states that there is to be no law-suit between teacher and pupil, father and son, husband and wife, and master and servant. This does not mean that law-suits between these pairs are altogether prohibited but that suits between them are undesirable, that the king or judges should persuade them to desist from proceeding in Court, that if they persist the court has to decide the suits according to the sāstra. 418 Manu (VIII. 299-300 ) prescribing the same punish ment as for a thief in cases where a wife, son, slave, servant or brother is beaten for correction more severely than is allowed in the sāstras by the husband, father, master, or elder brother respectively conveys by implication that a legal proceeding by these is possible. The smộtis did not encourage disputes based on

If a plaintiff states the defendant stole my gold, I deposited a thousand dranimas with him which he does not return, he sold a cow to me without being its owner', there is a joinder of three vyavahārapadas viz, steya, niksepa, asvāmivikraya. This is not a bad or altogether unacceptable plaint. All that is meant is that the trial of all these cannot be carried on simultaneously, but one after another.

flimsy or trumpery grounds. Bphaspati 419 says that a plaint that is nirarthaka ( i. e. the injury in which is very small or the monetary value involved is negligible) should not be entertained by the king. This is on the principle of de minimis non curat lex (the law does not take account of trifles ) also embodied in sec. 95 of the Indian Penal Code. 

When the plaint has been finally settled, the defendant should be called on to reply in writing to the plaint in the presence of the plaintiff ( Yāj. II. 7, Nār. II. 2). This is called uttara ( reply ) or pratipaksa (Nar. II. 2). When time may be given to the defendant for putting in his answer has already been stated above. 

The answer of the defendant must possess the following characteristics viz. it must completely meet all the points of the plaint, it must not deviate from the truth, must not employ vague words, must not be self-contradictory, it should not be such as to require further explanation (because of containing words in a foreign tongue or unknown or rarely used words or elliptical or badly arranged sentences ). 420 A reply is of four kinds, (1) mithya ( of denial ), sampratipatti or satya ( confession or admission), kārana or pratyavaskandana (of special plea or demurrer ), prānnyāya or pūrvanyāya ( of former judgment or res judicata ). A reply of denial may take four forms (Nār. II, 5) viz (1) this ( what is affirmed in the plaint) is false, I do not know anything about it, I was not present ( when the transact ion alleged in the plaint is said to have taken place ), I was then not born. 421 The first is a direct denial, the others are implied or indirect.

Where the defendant accepting as correct the matters (or facts ) set out by the plaintiff raises a plea, that is a reply of special plea. 423 The same is designed by some as adhārya or adharya (rendering futile) of the plaint. For ex ample, where plaintiff avers that defendant took one hundred rupees and defendant accepts that fact but adds either that he later on returned them or that they were really donated to him, that is a reply of special plea. Where a person though defeated in a (former ) proceeding again causes a plaint to be written and is addressed ( angwered ) with the words ' you were formerly defeated', that is a reply of former judgment. That there was a former judgment between the same parties may be proved by citing the judges or arbitrators or by citing other witnesses or by producing the writing itself i. e. the copy of the judgment ( Kāt. 172 ). 424 In a reply of admission there are only two stages of vyavahāra viz, the plaint and the reply; there is no need of proof ( so there is no kriyāpāda ) and the plaintiff succeeds as a matter of course ( and so there is no necessity of a regular judgment, nirnaya). Kāt. (173-190 ) states at great length the faults of a reply and also what are not proper replies. The Mit. (on Yāj. II. 7), Aparārka pp. 613-614, Sm. C. II. pp. 43-46 and

other digests quote long passages from Kāt., Bș., Harita, Vyāsa and others on faults of uttara and illustrate them at length. These have to be omitted for want of space. One of the faults is 'sankara'(mixture or confusion or misjoinder of pleas in defonce). For example, if the plaint alleges' the defendant took gold, a hundred rupees, certain valuable clothes and a quantity of corn and has not returned any of them,' and the defendant's reply is 'I took the gold, I never took any rupees, the plaintiff donated the clothes to me, as to the corn plaintiff had already filed a suit against me and failed'. Here the reply contains all four varieties, viz. the first is a reply of admission, the 2nd is one of denial, the third is a special plea and the 4th is a plea of former judgment. This is a sankara. But it is not meant that this reply would not be allowed. All that is meant is that, as the burden of proof varies, the adducing of evidence will not be allowed simultaneously, but one after another. Vide Mit. on Yāj. II. 7, Par. M. III. pp. 77–80. These questions are concerned with cases in which several issues arise, the burden of proving some of which lies on the plaintiff and the burden of proving others lies on the defendant. If a defendant does not come forward to give a reply, the king or judge should make him give one by sāma ( conciliatory words ), bheda (threats ) and other ways and if he does not give a reply for seven days after that, he may be declared to have been defeated and a decree may be passed against 425 him. Kaut. (III. 1), Yāj. II. 9, Nār. I. 55 Kāt. (163) state that a defendant cannot 426 raise a counter-claim (pratyabhiyoga ) as long as he has not met the attack of the plaintiff, nor should another plaintiff attack a person who is a defendant in a suit already filed, except in the case of abuse and assault, sāhasa ( death or grievous hurt by a weapon &c.), theft or in a very urgent matter, or in disputes among members of caravans or guilds or in charges of adultery, Yāj. II. 29, Nār. IV. 93, Sukra IV. 5. 120 say that when a litigant dies while a suit is pending, his son (or other representative ) who takes his estate should carry on the litigation or be liable for the claim and the son cannot add his own enjoyment (to make up

three generations &o, as required for possession ripening into ownership ). 427 

There were many grounds on account of which a litigant became what is called hina (a losing party) and some times either had his plaint dismissed or his defence struck out and a decree passed against him or he was simply fined. For example, Nār. II. 33 speaks of five kinds 428 of hina viz. one who changes his state ments (or pleading), who does not prosecute his pleading by adducing evidence (i. e. avoids investigation), who does not appear when summoned, who gives no reply, who disappears or runs away when summoned. Nār. I. 56-61, II. 24 explain some of these and other hina parties. Kāt. 202 (q. by Sm. O. II. p. 47) prescribes that the above five should respectively be fined 5, 10 12, 16 and 20 panas. Nār. 11. 25 states that in all civil disputes such as those about women, land or debts the litigant does not lose his cause even if he commits a mistake in his statements, but he is liable to fine. This conveys that in disputes arising out of wrath (manyuksta i.e. in criminal matters ) a person loses his cause if he is guilty of the above acts and he is prohibited from pursuing the matter again. Kaut. III. 1, Manu VIII. 53-57 contain in almost the same words, certain similar rules, Kaut. calling the several actions causes of parokia ( defeat). Vide Yāj. II. 16, Sukra IV. 5. 136, Kāt. 191-210 for further details on dismissal for default and cognate matters. In these cases of hinavādins, though a fine was imposed, a retrial could be ordered.

court; if they did so they were both to pay double of the fine imposed on a defeated party, as they deprived the king of his dues ( court fees). But a compromise with the court's permis sion was allowed when the parties were in doubt as to what the witnesses might say or the sabhyas might decide (in such cases it would be wisdom for the parties to compromise) and particularly when the evidence on both sides was evenly balanced or where there was a conflict between the different smrtis and usages. 

When the reply had been given the subhyas had to consider the question about the burden of proof. Br. 430 says the sabhyas after considering the nature of the reply should call upon ono of the parties that are in court to establish his case ' (Sm. C. II. p. 50). What a party sets out to establish is called sādhya and the means whereby the claim of the litigant) in its entirety is established is called sādhana ( Kāt. 213 in V. P. p. 79). Yāj. II. 7 and Nār. II. 27 say that the party (on whom the burden of proof lies ) should immediately (after the reply is given) write down the means whereby he proposes to prove his averments. This third stage (pāda) is called kriyā i. o. proof. Sadhya and kārya are synonyms, kriya and sādhana also are synonyms ( Kāt, in Aparārka p. 616, Vyāsa in Sm, C. II. p. 54). The rules about burden of proof are laid down by Hārita ( 9. in Mit, on Yāj. II. 7, Aparārka p. 616). In a reply of denial, the burden of proof is on the plaintiff, in a reply of former judgment or of a special plea, it is on the defendant and in a reply of admission no question of burden of proof arises. Compare also Nār. II. 31. The Mit. on Yāj. II. 80 states another rule that an affirmative proposition has to be proved by him who asserts it (bhāvapratijñāvādina eva kriya). Yāj. II. 22, Nār. II. 28-29 and IV. 69, Br. ( in Sm. C. II. p. 54 ), and others say that means of proof are two-fold, human and divine, and that docu ments, witnesses and possession are the human means of proof (Vas. 16. 10 also ), while the ordeals of balance and others are divine means. Yāj. II. 22, Nār. II. 29, Kāt. 217 expressly state that ordeals are to be resorted to only when none of the human means are possible or available. If one party relies on human means alone and the other offers divine means, the king (or judge ) has to accept human means and not divine; in disputes among men, if there be human means of proof though reaching

(or covering ) only a portion (of the allegations in the plaint) then human means should be accepted and not divine ones even though the latter may cover the whole ground ( Kāt. 218-219 9. by Mit. on Yaj. II. 22). This latter rule is based on the proposition laid down in Yaj. II. 20 and Vişnudharmasütra VI. 22 that when a party totally denies a claim and the opponent establishes by evidence a substantial portion of it, the judge may pass a decree against the denying party for the whole of the claim. This is practically the same as the maxim ' omnia praesumuntur contra spoliatorem '. 431 Therefore the general rule was that the divine mode of proof was to be resorted to only in the absence of any human means of proof. Kāt. 229 (q. by Mit. on Yāj. II. 22, Aparārka p. 629 ) allows witnesses or ordeals when the disputo is started with reference to sāhasa, assault or abuse and causes that spring from force and Kāt. 230 (4. in Sm. C. II. p. 51 ) provides that, in the case of a person guilty of sāhasa perpetrated in secret, investigation has to be made by divine proof. Kat. 225-228 (q. by Mit. on Yāj. II. 22, Aparārka P. 629, Sm. C. II. pp. 53-54) lay down certain rules about preference among the several means of proof: whatever are declared as the conventional usages of the associations of traders, of guilds (of artisans) and of groups (of brāhmaṇas ), the means of proving them are documents and not ordeals nor witnesses; enjoyment 431a ( or possession) alone is weightier in the case of the making and (the use of) doors and ways, as also in the case of water-courses and the like (i. e, in the case of easements ) and not writing nor witnesses; in the case of things promised to be given but not given, when a decision is to be given in disputes of servants with masters, in the matter of taking back a thing after it is sold or when a person having purchased a thing does not pay the price, in gambling and prize fighting-when in these matters disputes arise the means

of proof are witnesses and not documents nor ordeals. Marioi (q. by Sm, C. II. 60, V. P. P. 141 ) states that as regards the sale, mortgage, gift or partition of immoveable property & document ( should be executed as it ) enables the person ( in whose favour it is executed) to acquire (clear) title and freedom from doubt 43% (even after the lapse of years). It is in consonance with this that the Indian Legislature (in the Transfer of Property Act, IV of 1882 ) requires writing and registration as regards the sale, mortgage and gift of immoveable property. Nārada IV. 75 very concisely hits the special characteristics of each pramāņa: 

a document is always strong, witnesses are strong (as evidence) only as long as they are alive, possession becomes strong as time passes. The comparative strength of the several kinds of evidence is well put by Bphaspati 433: Witnesses are superior to inference ( circumstantial evidence ), a document is superior to witnesses, undisturbed possession for three generations is superior to all these'. Kāt. 221 (q. by Mit. on Yāj. II. 80 and V. P. p. 80 ) gives the warning that when a litigant abandoning a strong ground or means of proof resorts to a weak one to prove his case, he would not be again entitled to rely on that (strong ground of proof ) after the members of the court have decided as to who should succeed. This practically propounds the same rule as that of constructive res judicata contained in explanation 4 to section 11 of the Indian Civil Pro. Code (of 1908). 

The means of proof will now be briefly dealt with in order. And first come documents. Those in search of an exhaustive treatment may usefully consult Dr. Amareshwar Thakur's * Hindu Law of Evidence' (Calcutta, 1933). 

When writing was first employed in India and how the Indian Brahmi alphabet was derived have been moot points for many decades among scholars. Max Müller's theory ("History of Ancient Sanskrit Literature' p. 507 ) that the use of writing for literary purposes was unknown to Pāṇini was thoroughly exploded by Goldstückor in ‘Pāṇini and his place in Sanskrit Literature and was later on abandoned by Max Müller himself.

Origin of writing in India

Then Bühler ( in 'the Origin of the Indian Brahmi alphabet') started the theory that Brāhmi was derived from a foreign Semitic script about 800 B. C. and this hypothesis held the field for a long time ( vide 8. g. Rhys Davids in 'Buddhist India' chapters VII and VIII). Even Western scholars are not now prepared to accept this dating of Bühler; vide Cambridge History of India, vol. I.p. 141 (1922). The excavations at Mohenjo daro tend to throw grave doubts on this theory and discredit it. At Harappa and Mohenjo-daro there is writing (not satisfactori ly deciphered yet ) on burnt clay and pottery. The Piprahva vase shows writing on stone several centuries before the Christian era and the Sobagpur copperplate inscription is the earliest writing on copper plates yet discovered ( vide Annals of B. O. R. Institute, Vol. XI. p. 32 ff). This is not the place to discuss the questions about the origin of the art of writing in India and of the Brāhmi script. It cannot be gainsaid that the most ancient dharmaśāstras refer to writing as well-known. Gaut. XIII. 4 appears to refer to a witness signing himself as such on a document. Vas. 16. 10, Vispudharmasūtra VI. 23, Yāj. II. 22 mention likhita (document) as the first means of proof. Manu VIII. 51 uses the word karana in the sense of document (arthepavyayamūnam tu karanena vibhāvitam), in VIII. 168 refers to documents obtained by coercion and in IX. 232 to fabricated royal edicts ( kūțaśāsana). Kaut, has a special chapter ( II. 10) on royal writings (sāsana), in which he dilates upon the qualifications of the king's scribe, on the contents of an official document, the good points required in an official missive, on various divisions of writings and on the faults in official writings that are to be avoided. In I. 11 Kaut. prescribes that the king should hold consultations with absent ministers by sending a letter (patra, a leaf of palm or a piece of birch bark or similar material) and in I. 19 states that consulta tion by letter (para) with the council of ministers should be held in the fifth part of the day. In II. 7 Kaut. advises the con struction of rooms with shelves for books containing accounts (akşapatalam nibandhapustakasthānam kārayet ). Vide also Kaut. II. 21, II. 30, IV. 9, IV, 10 for references to writing in various other connections. Kaut. (III. 1) appears 434 to use the word karana - in the sense of document and gives a rule which is the same as Yāj. II. 23. Yaj. I. 319 speaks of land grants being written or

engraved on cloth or copperplate. Megasthenes (McCrindle p. 69 ) no doubt says that Indians have no written laws, but there is no doubt that he is under some misapprehengion as to what he was told, since in another place (p. 83 ) he refers to philosophers committing useful suggestions to writing. Similar ly Strabo ( XV. 1. 53-54 ) states that the Indians were ignorant of writing, but (67) narrates that Nearchus states that Indians write letters on cloth. One of the oldest copperplate grants is the Taxila plate of Moga (identified with Moa of the Sakas ) and is not later than 120 B. C. Vide E. I. Vol. IV. p. 54 and Rapgon's 'Indian coins' p. 7. It appears that wooden boards were used for writing ephemeral matters and patra for more permanent use, as Kāt. (p. 293, n. 400 above ) states that the first information was to be written on a board with chalk and the formal plaint on a leaf ( patra). The Lalitavistara ( 10th chap. p. 143, B. I. ed.) states that the Buddha used a board of sandal-wood for learning the scripts (-candanamayam lipi phalakam-ādāya ). 

Yaj. II. 84-94, Nār. IV. 69-75 and 135-146, Bř., Kat. 249-312, Sukra II. 291-318, IV. 172-182 and several digests devote great attention to documents. A fow salient points only will be brought out here. Nār. (IV. 70-71 ) eulogises documents by saying that if the Creator had not created writing which is like an excellent eye, the world would have come to grief and that a document is an indubitable means of apprehending the time, the place, the object, the material, the extent and the duration of & transaction. Bộ. (q. in V. P. p. 141 ) says that, since 435 people begin to entertain doubts (about a transaction) oven in six months (from an occurrence or transaction) the Creator therefore created in the hoary past letters which are recorded on writing material (patra). The Lalitavistara ( about 2nd or 3rd century A. D.) mentions 64 scripts which were known to the Buddha, among which the first is Brahmi ( 10th chap. p. 143 ). Nār., Br., and Sukra probably try to explain why the alphabet current in their days was called Brāhmi ( it was created by Brahma). Sukra II. 297, IV. 5. 172 are similar verses. The texts divide documents in different ways. Vişnu 436 Dh. S,

Classification of documents 

309 

VII. 2 dividos documents into three kinds viz. those written before the king (i. e. by public officers ), those bearing the superscription of witnesses and those without witnesses. The first is a document written in a state office by a scribe appoint od by the king and bearing the signature of the head or superintendent of the office. This is just like the registration of documents in modern India. Br. 437 (q. by V. P. p. 141, V. May, p. 24) divides documents into three sorts viz. royal writing, writing made at a fixed place and that written in one's own hand. Nār. IV. 135 speaks of two kinds viz. one written by the executant himself in his own hand and that written by another;( the first of these is valid) without attesting witnesses, while the second requires to be attested. In the former no writer (lekhaka ) nor witnesses are necessary, while in the latter both are necessary. Even now in India no deed concern ing even immoveable property is required by law to be attested except mortgages and gifts. The author of the Sangraha, the Mit. on Yāj. II. 84 and several others divide documents into rājakiya (public) and jānapada (private or of the common people ). The V. Mayükha (p. 24) says that laukika and jānapada are øynonyms and jānapada document is of two kinds viz. written by the executant himself in his own hand and that written by another, and that the first may be without attesta tion of witnesses, but the other must be attested. On Yāj. II. 22 the Mit, divides documents into śāsana and ciraka. The first is the same as rājakiya (described in Yaj, I. 318-320) and ciraka is practically the same as jānapada writing. On Yāj. II. 89 the Mit. remarks that a royal deed must be written in correct and elegant language but a document executed by ordinary people is not required to be in correct Sanskrit, but may be written in the local dialect of the parties. Yāj. II. 89 states that a document written by the executant himself in his own hand is autho ritative except when it is brought about by force or fraud. Yāj. II. 84-87 prescribe that a document of debt or the like should be written down by mutual agreement, that the creditor's name should be placed first, that it should

mention the year, month, half month, tithi ( day ), the names, caste, gotras, the Vedic School, the names of the fathers of the parties, that when the writing is finished the debtor should write at the end that the deed is approved by N. N. (the execu tant) son of so and so, that an even number (i. e. not less than two) should attest the document, stating their father's names and that they attest as witnesses and the scribe should write at the end that he wrote the document at the request of both parties. If the debtor or any witness cannot write, his signa ture should be made by another in the presence of all witnesses (Nar. q. by Mit, on Yāj. II. 87 and by Vy. Nir. p. 87 without name ). Rājakiya documents are of three kinds (acc. to Br. quoted in V. P. p. 141, V. May. p. 24) viz. sāsanı (a royal grant of land), jayapatra (a judgment deciding a law-suit), prasāda-patra ( a deed showing the king's pleasure at the devoted service or bravery of a person); acc. to Vasiştha (g. in Sm. C. II. p. 55 and V. May, p. 28) it is of four kinds viz. sāsana, jayapatra, ājñāpatra (a royal command addressed to feudatories, high or low officers like the wardens of the marches ), prajfhāpanāpatra (a writing of request addressed by the king to sacrificial priests, a purohita, teacher, learned brahmapas or other highly honoured persons); it is five-fold acc. to S. V. pp. 111-113 viz. sāsana, jayapatra, ajñāpatra, pra jñāpanāpatra and prasā dapatra. Kaut. in II. 10 speaks of seve ral kinds of royal orders and names them, such as prajñāpana (request by a messenger about what another prays), ajñāpatra (as above), paridāna (honour to the deserving or gift in distress), parihara (remission of taxes for certain castes or villages by the king), niss stilekha (writing whereby the king accepts the actions or words of some trustworthy person as his own), pra vȚttika (conveying information about some portentous happen ing or some news about enemies etc.), pratilekha (reply in accordance with discussion held with the king on a message from another), sarvatraga (order addressed to high functionaries and officers for the welfare of travellers). The contents and form of royal grants have been described in H. of Dh. vol. II pp. 860-861. The jānapada writings are divided into various sorts, seven (aco, to Br. g. by Aparārka p. 683, Sm. C: II. p. 60) or eight (aco, to Vyasa in Sm. C. II. p. 59 ) and the Sm, C. remarks that there is no emphasis on the number and there may be many more varieties. Bp. (S. B. E. vol. 33 p. 305), Kāt. (254-257) and others mention and define the following jānapada writings; bhāga- or vibhāgapatra' (deed of partition), dānapatra (deed. of gift),

Varieties af documents.

krayapatra (sale deed), adhānapalra or adhipatra ( deed of pledge or mortgage), sthitipatra or samvitpatra (deed of convention, which is made by the inhabitants of a village or city or the members of a corporation or guild by mutual agreement for settling their conventions), dāsapatra (deed of bondage to serve executed by a person devoid of food or clothing), ralekha or uddhārpatra (bond of debt promising return at a future date with interest ), risuddhipatru (deed of purification given to a person with the attestation of witnesses when a penance for a sin has been per formed), sandhipatra (deed of peace when a compromise in the presence of leading people after a charge of the commission of a crime has been made), simāpatra (deed of boundary when a dispute about it is settled), upagata (a receipt passed by the creditor to a debtor on payment of the whole or part of a debt, Yāj. II. 93), anvādhipatra (a sub-mortgage i. e. where the mort gagee or pledgee mortgages or pledges the property or thing to another and hands over tbe former deed to his own creditor). The two branches of private documents (jānapada) are either ciraka or not ciraka; ciraka is defined as a document written by hereditary scribes residing in the capital, who are approached by the parties and bearing the signatures of the parties and witnesses and the names of their fathers (Sangraha q. by Sm. C. II. p. 59, Par. M. III. p. 127). Vide n. 437 above and Sukra II. 299-318 and IV.5.172-177 for definitions of these and other kinds of documents. But acc. to Vyasa quoted by Sm. C. II. p. 59 private documents are of eight kinds viz. ciraka, upagata (a receipt), svahasta (written by the executant himself), ādhipatra, krayapatra, sthitipatra, sandhipatra, višuddhipatra. Some works like the Vyavahārasāra (p. 69) and the Mit. write the word as ciraka and not ciraka. It was so called (viz, ciraka ) probably because it was written on the back (of the bark of the birch or some other tree). If the proper word is ciraka then it was employed because being executed by scribes appointed by the king, it had validity for all time (cira) as compared with purely private documents. 'Ciraka' in this last sense seems to be equal to sthānakrta' of other writers. 

Nār. 438 IV. 136, Vişnu. Dh. S. VII. 11 and Kat. (252) require that a document is held valid which is not adverse to the cus tom of the country, the contents of which follow the rules

regarding pledges (and other transactions) and the sequence of the sense and of the words in which is not contradictory or confusing. Sm. C. II. p. 59 applies the word 139 pañcārūdha (on which five are recorded) to documents that are signed by the creditor, the debtor, two witnesses and the scribe. The Sarasvativilāsa p. 114 holds that pañcārudhatva consists in having the creditor, debtor, witnesses ( as one item ), scribe and the matter to be written, Hārsta and Vyasa (q. in 8m. C. IL p. 59 ) employ the dual (sākşiņau), while Yāj. II. 87 employs the plural. Therefore ordinarily two witnesses sufficed, but in very important writings there should be more witnesses. Viāva. rūpa reads 'asamāḥ' in Yaj. II. 87 and requires three witnesses as the minimum. Nār. IV. 137, Vişnu440 Dh. S. VII. 6-10, Br. (S. B. E. vol. 33 p.307 v. 23.), Kāt. (271) state that a document is invalid that is executed by a person intoxicated, by one already charged (with an offence), by a woman, a minor, that has been brought about by threats or deceit or coercion, by one dying, by one diseased, by a lunatic, or by those that are dependent. Vişnu Dh. S. (VII. 8-9) and Kat. 273 (g. by V. M. p. 338, Apararka p. 686, Par, M. II. p. 131) state that a docu ment may be held invalid owing to defects in the witnesses or in the scribe or to the fraud of the creditor or executant. 

Nār. IV. 145, Kāt. (306-307), Samyarta ( both quoted by Aparārka pp. 691-692) and Br. (S. B. E. 33 p. 309 verse 31 ) say that no oral evidence should be allowed to contradict the (terms of a) document, that the mode of proving ( a matter) by a docu ment is always superior, that a writing can be refuted or superseded only by another document relating to the same matter and not by the oaths of witnesses and that if oral evidence

were allowed to overrule the force of documents there would be confusion and an end to all written transactions441. If there is a conflict among documents then a jānapada document (written by a scribe and attested ) is superior to one written in the hand of the executant himself and a public document is superior to a jānapada one ( Vyasa q. by Sm. C. II. p. 66, S. V. p. 122 ). 

Yāj. IL 91, Nār. IV. 146 and Kāt. 31% (q. by Aparārka p. 687 ) prescribe that when a document is in another country or when it is illegibly written, when it is lost or its letters have become indistinct (by lapse of time or other causes) or it has been stolen or is crushed or burnt or shattered into pieces, another document may be caused to be written ( if both parties agree): but if they do not agree and the contents have to be proved or if the executant denies his signature, then Nār. IV. 142 and Kāt. ( 282 q. by Sm. C.

When there is a doubt about the genuineness of a docu ment, it can be established by comparison with other documents admitted to be written or signed by the same person, by ratioci nation, by the probability of the two parties being together at the time of the transaction, by citing the attesting witnesses, 445 by the peculiarities or flourishes in writing certain letters or making certain signs (in the writing questioned and in other admitted writings), the previous transactions between the par ties (or their subsequent conduct), and the source of the acqui sition of the subject matter in dispute (Yāj. II. 92, Visnu Dh. $. VII. 12, Nār. IV. 143-144, Kāt. 283 q. in Mit. on Yāj. II. 92). Vişpu Dh. S. (VII. 13) and Kāt. 446 285-286 ( q. by Aparārka pp. 689-690) prescribe that if the debtor, creditor, witnesses or the scribe be dead the authenticity of the document has to be ascertained by (a comparison of the signatures on the disputed document) with other specimens of their handwriting or signatures or other documents executed by the debtor. Kāt. 287 (g. by Aparāka p. 689, Sm. C. II. p. 64 and Par. M. III. p. 134) states the striking147 rule that when a document bears the royal seal, that document is presumed to be authentic, even though all the three (viz. the debtor, the witnesses and the scribe ) are dead. This shows that documents bearing the king's seal or that of royal officers were regarded as prima facie genuine and this rule is analogous to the provisions in sec. 79 of the Indian Evidence Act and sections 59-60 of the Indian Registra tion Act.

A, vol. 30 pp. 201 223 for many forged grants. Verses (variously attributed to Kāt. or Brhaspati by the digests) state that when a loan ( recorded in a document) has not been expressly claimed by the creditor able to claim from a debtor who is able to pay off and who is at hand, the document loses its validity because a suspicion arises that the debt has been paid off and that a document executed more than thirty years before which has never been seen ( by any body ) nor read out ( by the creditor to any body ) does not attain validity even though the witnesses on it are living. Nār. IV. 141 is very similar to this last. Kāt. 298–299, 301 (q. by Par. M. III. 136, Mit, on Yāj. II. 24, Aparārka P. 690-691 ) prescribe that if no objection is raised for twenty years as regards a patent fault in a document of debt or pledge or of the settlement of boundaries, then the document ceases to be voidable. Kāt. 275 and Bṛ. ( S. B. E. vol. 33 p. 302 V. 25 ) both quoted by Aparārka p. 671 and V. P. p. 122 require that the latent defects in documents or witnesses must he declared ( pointed out) by the disputant at the ( proper ) time (i. e. when they are produced), while patent defects may be considered by the sabhyas at the time (of the consideration of the evidence) by reference to the rules of the śāstra. Yāj. II 93-94, Visnu Dh. S. VI. 25–26 448 prescribe that when a debtor pays part of a debt, the debtor should write on the back of the document how much he paid or the creditor may hand over to the debtor a writing of receipt signed or written by himself, particularly when the original document is not at hand, and when the whole debt is paid or the contract is fully performed the creditor should tear off the document or should execute another document in order to make clear the fact of satisfaction 

The fabrication of royal edicts and private documents was so much condemned by the sentiments of society that Manu IX, 232 and Visnu Dh. S. V. 9-10 prescribe the extreme penalty of death for such offences as in the case of the murder of women, minors and brāhmaṇas. Yāj. II. 295 ( = Matsya 227. 202)

CHAPTER XII 

BHUKTI or BHOGA (possession ). 

According to Gaut. X. 39 a man becomes an owner by inheritance, purchase, partition, seizure (appropriation of forest trees and other things which have no owner ) and find ing (i. e. appropriation of lost property the owner of which is unknown). Gaut. (X. 40-41) adds that in the case of brāhmaṇas acceptance (of a thing donated) is an additional mode (of becoming an owner), that conquest in the case of a ksatriya and gain ( by trade or labour ) in the case of a vaisya or sūdra are also additional modes. Vag. 16. 16 mentions eight modes. Br. ( quoted in V. P. p. 153, Aparārka p. 635, S. B. E. vol. 33 p. 309 v. 2) mentions seven modes of acquiring immovable property viz. by learning, purchase, mortgage, valour (i. e, conquest ), through the wife ( as dowry ), inheritance (from an ancestor ) and succession to an issueless kinsman, Nārada (q. in Sm. C. II. p. 70) mentions the same except mortgage. None of these expressly says that long possession is by itself a source of ownership. Great divergence 449 has prevailed throughout the centuries among the sages and digests about the relation of title and possession and about the length of possession necessary for making a person secure in his right to property by reason of possession. Possession (bhukti ) may be with title ( sāgamā) or without title ( anagamū). Agama means ' origin' or 'source of title' such as purchase or simply ' title :. 450 Manu VIII. 200, Yaj. II. 27, Nār. IV. 84 employ that word in that sense. Vide Kāt. 317 (q. in Sm. C. II p. 73 and Par. M. III. p. 141). If property is held in one of the modes of acquiring ownership stated above and there is also possession, one's right to that property is indefeasible ( Nār. IV. 85, Bř. q. by Sm. C. II. p. 70, S. B. E. 33 pp. 309 and 312 v. 3 and 22 ), but possession without a clear title

does not lead to (or ripen into ) ownership 451 ( with certain exceptions to be noted later on). Vyāsa and Pitāmaha 482 declare that possession in order to be valid must have five characteristics viz. it must have title behind it, must be of long standing, unbroken, free from protest ( by another person) and in the presence ( i. e. before the very eyes ) of the opponent (q. in Mit. on Yāj. II. 27 and Aparārka p. 635 ). Even title, if not accompanied by some slight possession, has no strength, while title is stronger than possession not handed down hereditarily (Yāj. II. 27). Nār. IV, 85 states that possession becomes strong when backed by clear title. These passages present some difficulty and make title and possession depend on each other. Nār. ]V. 77 states that even if there be a document or witnesses to support a man's title, when there is no enjoyment, particularly in the case of immovable property, there is no validity. All that is, meant is that a transfer without possession though under a deed or before witnesses is risky and that title and possession lend support to each other as stated by Nār. IV. 84-86, Bş., Harita and Pitāmaha. 453 Nār. (IV. 86-87 ) declares that one who pleads mere possession and no title at all should be considered a thief on account of his putting forward the deceptive plea of possession (which even a thief can assert) and that the king should punish as a thief one who enjoys a property even for hundreds of years without title. All that this last verse means is that the person in possession must prove legal origin or such a long possession that there is no possibility of an inference that the possession

of his ancestor originated is wrong. Delivery of possession was the principal mode of transferring ownership in ancient times in almost all systems of jurisprudence and so possession was given great weight as evidence of ownership. 454 The Mit. on Yāj. II. 27 makes the position clear. In the case of a gift or sale there must be the cessation of the ownership of the transferor and the arising of the ownership of the transferee. This last occurs only when the transferee accepts the property and not otherwise. Acceptance is mental, vocal and physical (i. e. the acceptor makes a resolve to accept, says that he accepts and takes physical possession). These three may exist in the case of such movable articles as gold, clothes &c. But in the case of a field physical acceptance is not possible except by enjoying the fruits or profits thereof. Therefore in order to make a gift or sale perfect there must be some slight possession at least. In the absence of such possession mere title is weak. Title may succeed against the man in possession who has no title and who has not been in possession for the prescribed period (such as three generations ). If the possessor proves possession for that period he will succeed against one who has bare title and 110 possession whatever. If it is known or proved that a man purchased from A but got no possession and that another purchased from A subsequently and got possession (but was not in continuous possession for the prescribed period ) the prior title though without possession will prevail over the later one, acc. to Yāj. II. 23. But when it is doubtful as to which title is prior and which posterior the one with possession will prevail. Where the possession has been uninterruptedly with a man's ancestors for three genera tions he will succeed against one who has bare title. Therefore possession was not absolutely indispensable for transfer even acc. to the Mit. and other works, but title without posses sion was risky and so possession was insisted upon as it was .nine points of law'. It follows, acc, to the Mit., that (1) when possession was comparatively of short duration and not supported by any title much weight was not attached to possession and title by itself would prevail against it, that (2) continuous possession for three generations (though there is

nothing to show there was title to begin with ) will prevail over a mere documentary title and that (3) a prior title with less than the possession for three generations (but with some possession ) succeeds over a later title accompanied by posses Bion. Long possession was assumed to have originated in legal title, although owing to lapse of time it was not possible to prove the origin. 45$ The main controversy has raged round the question of what is long possession. Yāj. II. 24 literally translated means ' loss of land results in twenty years when it is enjoyed by a stranger before the owner's very eyes and without any protest from him and loss of chattels ( resulte under similar circumstances) in ten years'. Manu VIII. 147-148 and Nārada IV. 79-80 have two verses in common which mean * If the owner of anything silently looks on (i. e. raises no protest) when it is being enjoyed in his presence for ten years by strangers he does not deserve to recover it (i.e. he loses the thing). When the owner is not an idiot nor a minor and his property is enjoyed within his sight then the property being lost by his conduct (vyavahāra ) comes to belong to the enjoyer', Gaut. XII. 34 has almost 456 the same words as Manu VIII. 148. Sankha (in V. R. p. 208) algo refers to ten years. These passages apparently mean that at the end of 20 or 10 years' adverse possession by the wrongful possessor the ownership of the original owner is lost and the wrongful possessor becomes the owner. But there are several other smộti passages where it is said that possession even for a hundred years originating in wrong cannot confer title and much longer periods are required for the loss of ownership and the acquisition of ownership by prescription. Vide Nār. IV. 86-87 cited (on p. 318 above ). Nār. (IV. 89 ) himself says elsewhere that possession requires

By French Law the time of memory was held to extend for one hundred years as done by the Mit. and other Sanskrit digests. Vide Salmond's Jurisprudence (9th ed. of 1937) p. 265. note y.

Meaning of smārtakala 

321 

to be supported by title only during smārtaküla (during human memory), but in cases beyond human memory possession con tinued successively for three generations (or ancestors) is proof of ownership even in the absence of a document (or other title). Visnu Dh. S. V, 187 is in similar 457 terms. The Mit. on Yāj. (II. 27 ) says that smārtakāla is a period of 100 years, as the Veda declares that the span of a man's life is 100 years. For a hundred years it is possible for witnesses to depose to the origin of possession. So if there is possession for less than one hundred years, oral evidence can be adduced for establishing its origin, and title will have to be proved by the possessor and if no oral evidence is adduced to prove title, it is a case in which it may be held as certain that there was no title to begin with. Mere possession is not enumerated by sages like Gautama among the means of acquiring ownership. As the Sarasvati vilāsa (p. 124) puts it, long uninterrupted possession only leads to an inference that it originated in title acquired by sale, gift or the like i. e, there arises a presumption of lawful origin 458 Therefore in order to enable a man tu rely on possession alone us proof uf ownership it must extend uninterruptedly over 100 years (acc. to the Mit.). The Smrticandrika 459 (II. p. 72) accepts this nieaning, only requiring 105 years' possession in stead of 100 years'. Acc. to a smrti quoted by it each genera. tion means 35 years and so when Nārada requires possession for three generations 105 years are meant (acc. to Sm. C.). Vişnu Dh. S. V. 187, Kāt. (327) also hold that continuous enjoyment for three generations makes the fourth generation owner of the land. Kāt. (321 g. by Mit. on Yāj. Il. 27, Apa rārka p. 636 ) states 'in cases falling within the memory of man it is desirable that possession must be accompanied with title

(in order to be proof of ownership as to land); but in cases beyond the memory of man possession extending over three generations in succession (is independent proof of ownership), since there is no certainty that there was no title (to begin with)'. Vide also Bộ. (in S. B. E. vol. 33 p. 313 verges 26-28). "Three generations' is a vague expression. The great-grandfather, the grandfather and the father of a man may die in the space of ten years and if the great-grandfather took possession wrongfully and all died within ten years of the time of taking possession one after another, the fourth in descent might urge that there was posses sion for three generations and that he had become owner, Therefore Kāt, in another verse (318, q. by Aparārka p. 636 and V. P. p. 155) laid down that unbroken possession for three generations extending over sixty years becomes firin ( indepen dent means of proof of ownership). Thus tripuruşa-bhoga or purvakramāgatu-bhoga (in Yāj. II. 27 ) means the same thing as possession continuing from a time beyond human memory (asmārta-kāla) and is equal to 60 years acc. to Kāt., Vyāsa and a few other smộti writers 469 Nārada (4. by Aparārka p. 636 ) says that as regards possession one generation means twenty years, while Br. (q. by Sm. C. II. p. 72) says it means thirty years. It will be noticed from the above that early authors like Gaut., Manu., Yāj. appear to lay down 20 years' adverse enjoy ment of land as sufficient to create ownership, while other and comparatively later authors like Nār. and Kāt. require sixty years enjoyment. In order to remove this conflict and following the maxim that apparently conflicting texts should be reconciled as far as possible, the writers of commentaries and digests froni Visvarūpa and Medhātithi (on Manu VIII. 148) downwards proposed various interpretations of Yāj. II. 24 and similar texts. Some lay emphasis on possession and others on title. There are at least three explanations. Aparārka (pp. 631-632), Kullūka and Raghunandana take the literal sense and say that on 20 years' adverse possession there is loss of ownership (i. e. there

I] Three views about twenty years' enjoyment 323 is svatvahāni) 461. The 2nd explanation is that the meaning of Yāj. II. 24 is that after 20 years' enjoyment by a stranger, if the owner brings a suit and relies on a document in his favour, he runs the risk of being unable to prove his ownership barely on the strength of the docunent, since it is possible to argue that, even though he had a document, by his silence he acquiesced in the stranger taking possession and tacitly consented to it. Therefore all that Yāj. II. 24 means or recommends is that an owner should not be negligent (upekšā) or should not remain silent when a stranger takes wrongful possession. This view was first started by Visyariipa among extant writers and it approaches the modern idea of requiring vigilance in the asser tion of ones' rights 462 ; that is there is only loss of the suit (vyavahārahāni). This view lays emphasis on a verse attri buted to Nār. and the word vyuvahāra in it and in Manu VIII. 148 and Nārada IV. 80, where the word means lawsuit also, the idea being that the sages declare only what would happen or be decided by the judges in a law court and do not intend to say that the decision would be just or righteous from the higher or the moralist's point. The third view is that of the Mit. (followed by the Vyavahāramayukha, Mitramiśra and several others) which 163 oxplains that the loss is not that of the ownership of the thing itself but of the produce of it ( there is only phala hāni') i. e. if without protest the owner allows a stranger to remain in possession before his very eyes for twenty years and then he brings a suit, he inay succeed in getting back his land but he would lose his claim to the profits of the land.

elaborate discussions on Yāj. II. 24; but considerations of space forbid any further reference to them. The V. M. 464 connects Yāj. II. 24 with the preceding verse (viz. that in mortgages, gifts and sales a prior transaction prevails over a later one) and reinarks that this verse (Yaj, II. 24) says that if a person after a gift, sale, or mortgage to him allows the property to remain with the seller, donor or mortgagor, who subsequently transfers it to another with possession and the latter holds it for twenty years, then the first dealing though prior is of no avail (as it is not accompanied with possession for 20 years). Srikara ( as stated in tho Vyavahāramātņkā) tried to reconcile the conflicting smrti texts by holding that in twenty years the real owner lost ownership if he was present and did not protest while a stranger was in possession, but passages speaking about possession for throo generations (or sixty years ) applied only where the owner was absent. The Mit. and others point out that Yāj. II. 24 (who employs the words 'paśyatah' and 'abruvatah') conveys that if a stranger takes possession while the owner is absent or if the owner protests, then even 20 years' possession does not lead to the loss of anything. The text of Nār. IV. 87 quoted above (p. 318) shows that the sage held that possession for several hundr ed years aven would not avail the possessor if it is certain or established that the possessor had no title at all to begin with or that his possession started wrongfully. This text is empha sized by those who favour title and want to discourage persons benefiting by their own wrongdoing. But there are other smrti texts of a contrary tenor. For example, Nār. IV. 91 himself says 'whatever has been enjoyed even unlawfully for three generations (i. e, by three ancestors ) including the father cannot be recovered by the owner from the person (who is the 4th in succession) because it has gone through three lives in succession'; a text of Hārita states 'what has been enjoyed by three prior ancestors without any title whatever cannot be recovered back (from the present holder, who is th), since it has descended successively through three generations. These two are relied upon by those whe hold long possession as leading

Inference of title from long possession 

325 

to an inference of title (tripurusız-blunktivādinah, as Medhātithi on Manu VIII. 148 calls them). These like the Vyavahāra tattva and Vivādacandra 465 who rely solely on possession boldly say that long possession even originating in wrong leads to ownership. Medhātithi says 'there can be no memory of the origin of title when there has been possession for hundreds of years and (if title had to be proved for the origin of such possession) a king may resume villages enjoyed by ancient temples, brāhmaṇas and mathas; therefore ancient possession is evidence of ownership because it makes it extremely probable that the ancient possession originated in gift or the like'. The Mit. on Yāj. II. 27 (which is suuttavādi) refers to all the three views, refutes the first two and accepts the view of loss of profits. It does not literally interpret the texts of Harita and Nārada quoted above, takes them to be over-statements and intended to convey that continuous possession for over three generations cannot be interfered with even if there is no clear proof of the origin of title. In modern India under the Indian Limitation Act (IX of 1908) the tendency is to prescribe the very short period of twelve years for adverse possession in order to defeat a title, following the English Real Property Limita tion Act of 1833 (3 and 4 William IV chap. 27), sec, 2 of which insisting on vigilance by every one about one's rights however prescribes the period of 20 years within which to bring an action for recovery of land. Modern case law has rather gone too far and sets a premium on wrongful possession by holding that it is not necessary that adverse possession should have been brought to the knowledge of the real owner 466 Ancient Hindu lawyers put down the tendency to usurp another's property and placed many obstacles in the way of the wrongful possessor. 

It may be noted that there were a low raro toxts that referred to very short periods for possession causing loss of

title, viz. 3 years for immovable property (provided there was no permissive origin, hşamālingn) or one year for corn, cattle and other movables 107. This idea being opposed to innumerable texts was explained away as merely conveying the great im portance of possession. Marici states 168 that cows, beasts of burden, ornaments that are borrowed through friendship should be returned within four or five years, otherwise the owner would lose them. This is opposed to Manu VIII. 146 and other texts and so is explained as being applicable only if there is no sufficient cause for allowing them to remain with the borrower. The ancient Roman Law was very like this. Before Justinian the Roman Law gave the ownership of a thing hy quiet posses nion bona fide and founded on good title if maintained during one year over movables and during two years over immovable property 69. Justinian altered this and provided that possession during three years gave ownership of movable' and possession during ten years ( if partios resided in the same province) (r during twenty years ( if they did not) gave the ownership of immovable property. 

Br. (S. B. E. vol. 33 p. 314 verse 31 ) lays down the proposi tion that if a person has title and is already in possession and is dispossessed by another then he may succeed in a lawsuit on the strength of his prior possession provided the dispossessor does not establish continuous possession for three generations 470. This is similar to a suit in ejectment contemplated by Art. 142 of the Indian Limitation Act. 

Br. (S. B. E. vol. 33 p. 310 v. 11) and Kāt. 335 ( both quoted by Aparārka p. 637, V. P. p. 166 ) state that what is enjoyed by a man's agnates and cognates and his own people does not pass to their ownership by their mere possession; one should regard

Cases where possession is ineffective

possession ( as leading to ownership ) in cases other than these. Pitāmaha states that possession by a stranger is powerful, but possession by members of one's own family has certainly not the same force 471. This appears to adumbrate the principle of modern law that possession by one co-owner or une tenant-in common is ordinarily the possession of all co-owners and the mere fact that the profits of a property have been enjoyed by only one co-heir or tenant-in-common for many years does not by itself amount to the ouster of the other tenants-in-common 472. It is stated in Gaut. XII. 35 that property which is enjoyed for a long time by a srotriya, an ascetic or a king's officer is not lost to the owner by that enjoyment, since the owner may have thought that he would reap long-enduring spiritual merit by the first two enjoying this property ( such as a vacant huuse) or that he might bo prevented from asserting his right from fear ( of the royal official) Compare Bṛ. ( S. B. E. vol. 33 p. 311 v. 12 ). 473 Manu VIII. 149 ( = Nār. IV. 81 and Vas. 16. 18), Yāj. 11. 25, Br. (S. B. E. 33 p.312 v. 21), Kat. (330) state the following exceptions to the rule of loss by long possession; il niortgaged or pledged property, boundary, minor's property, an upen deposit, a sealed deposit, women (female slaves ), the property of the king i, e. (of the State) and the property of it brāhmana learred in the Veda are not lost by the possession of another (for twenty or ten years referred to in Manu VIII, 147 and Yāj. II. 24). Manu VIII. 145 provides that neither a pledge nor a deposit can be lost by lapse of time and that both are recoverable even if they have remained long ( with the pledgee or depositee). Yāj. 11. 25 adds to the above list the properties of idiots and of women. Nār. IV. 83 uniphatically states that women's property (stri dhana) and state property (land) is not lost even after hundreds of years, when it is enjoyed without title. Kāt. (330) adds to the above list toniple property and what is inherited

The Mit. on Yāj. II. 25 gives reasons why the several exceptions are made in the case of a pledge or mortgage the property is enjoyed by the pledgee or mortgagee under an agreement and so there is no fault on the part of the owner if he remains quiet while the property is being enjoyed by the creditor; boundaries between villages can be easily established by such signs as trees ( grow ing on the border ), streaky of chaff and coal (buried under ground ); deposits are entrusted to a person out of confidence for being preserved and not for enjoyment; idiots and minors are ignorant or incapable of understanding their rights; the king being engrossed in numerous state affairs may not be able in time tu look into the question about possession of state properties; women on account of their ignorance and timidity may not assert their rights and a learned brāhmana being devoted to learning, teaching and performance of rites and duties may have no time to go to law. In inodern times also the law favours minors and other persons as indicated in the note below 475. Kāt. (331-334 q. by Par, M. III. p. 148, Sm. C. II p. 69

Under the Indian Limitation Act, a mortgagor can sue for redemp tion and possession within 60 years from the time when the right to redeem accrues (Art. 148), though for ordinary suits for possession the period is 12 years; while a pawnor of moveable property has 30 years (Art. 145) from the date of the pawn; if a thing is entrusted to a man for a specific purpose as a trustee then sec. 10 of the Limitation Act provides that no length of time will bar a suit for recovering from him or his legal representatives or voluntary assigns the trust property or its proceeds (upanidhi and niksepa may be examples of trust); a suit on behalf of the Secretary of State for India can be brought within 60 years (Art. 149); sections 6-8 provide longer periods for persons who were minors, idiots or lunatics at the time when their rights were invaded. Under the Real Property Limitation Act of 1833 (3 and 4 William IV chap. 27 sections 16 and 17) a suit could be brought within ten years of the time when the disability ceased in the case of minors, lunatics, idiots, those absent beyond the seas, but no suit can be

CHAPTER XIII 

WITNESSES (saksinah). 

The word saksin occurs in the Svetasvataropanisad 76 (VI. 11) wliere it is applied tu the une immanent Spirit of the uni. verse as All-seving. Panini 477 V. 2. 91 explains the word sākşin as meaning one who has directly seen'. Gaut. 478 XIII. 1, Kant. III. 11, Nar. IV. 147 state that when two persons litigate and there is a doubt or discrepancy between the two the deter mination of the truth in the dispute is due to witnesses. Manu VIII. 74, Sabhaparva 479 68,84, Nar. IV. 148, Vishu Dh. S. 8. 13, Kat. 346 (q. in V. M. p. 317 and V. P. p. 106) provide that a (proper) witness is one who has himself either seen or heard or experienced the matter in dispute. This means that the evidence of a witness must be direct and should not be what is called hearsay, Medhātithi (on Manu VIII. 74) says 480 that hearsay evidence occurs when a person who hears from another that has himself heard soinething from another coines forward as a witness and that hearsay is no legal evidence. Manu VIII. 76 prescribes that even though a man may not have been expressly asked or appointed by the parties (in the word:4 ' you are the witness to this transaction'), he is a proper witness when asked it to any matter in dispute that lie has himself seen or heard. The only exception to hearsay evidence ullowed by

Witnesses 

331 

the Visņu Dh. S. VIII. 12 is that 481 when a person that is appoin ted as a witness is dead or gone abroad, those who have heard what he said may give evidence. It has already been stated. (p. 297) that a king was not to delay the examination of witnesses, Kāt. (340-341 q. by Aparārka pp. 675,677, Sm, C. II. p.92, V. M. p. 331) prescribes that the king (or the chief judge) should himself examino the witnesses that are present (in court) and should consider along with the sahlyas the statements made by witnesses and that, where it is doubtful who the witnesses on a disputed matter are, time should be given for producing the witnesses in order to ascertain the proper means of proof but that where it is clear who the witnesses may be he should make the hearing of the case proceed at once. Kāt. (352) further prescribes 482 that when it is impossible to bring witnesses because they reside in a foreign country, evidence taken in writing before a man learned in the three Vedas and sent by him should be read in deciding the cause 483 Gaut. 13. 2, Manu VIII. 60, Yāj. II. 69, Nār. IV. 153 and others require that ordinarily there should be at least three witnesses in a cause. Br. (S. B. E. 33 p. 301 v. 16 ) says that there may be nine, seven, five, four or three witnesses, or two only if they are learned brāhmaṇas 18 Vişnu Dh. S. VIII. 5 and Bp. (S. B. E. vol. 33 p. 301 v. 16 ) emphasize that a single witness alone cannot be examined for deciding a matter 185.

But Yaj. II. 72, Vişnu Dh. S. VIII. 9, Nār. IV. 192 state that one man alone may be a witness in a cause if he is endowed with the regular performance of his religious duties ( is possessed of the qualities stated in Vişņu Dh. S. VIII. 8) and is accepted as a witness by both sides. Vide Manu VIII. 77 also. Br. (S. B. E. vol. 33 p. 301 v. 18) allows a single witness to furnish valid proof if he is a dūtaka 486 (messenger), an accountant, one who has accidentally witnessed the transaction or if he is the king or the chief justice. Vyāsa says 487 that even a single person may be enough in a cause, especially in heinous offences called sāhasa, if he be one whose actions are pure, who knows the dharma and whose truthfulness has been well attested before. Kaut. (III. 11 ) says that a single witness (whether a man or a woman) may be enough in cases where the transaction in question was effected in secret (except the king and one performing austerities ), 488 Kāt. (353-355 q. hy V, M. pp. 319-320, Sm. C. II. 76, V, P. pp. 112-113 ) states that even a single person may be allowed to depose as a witness if he was taken in confidence at the time of making a deposit; so also a messenger sent by a litigant for borrowing an article (such as an ornament) or the manufacturer of an article may alone be sufficient to prove the identity of the article or when a matter has been decided by the king or chief judge, the scribe, the chief justice or any one of the sabhyas may alone prove the plea of res judicatu or the point as to what was said by the plaintiff or the defendant in a suit 189, Vide Br, (S. B. E. 33 p. 300 verses 13-14). 

The qualifications of witnesses to be examined in a suit are stated in numerous places such as Gaut. XIII, 2, Kaut. III. 11, Manu VIIL 62-63, Vas. 16.28, Sankha-Likhita (q. in S. V, p. 138 ), Yāj.

The principal qualifications are ; 4894 they should be born of a good family, should have lived hereditarily in the country, should be householders having a son or sons, should be well-to-do and men of character, should be trustworthy, should know dharma and act up to it, should not be covetous and should have been cited by the parties as witnesses. Some Smrti texts such as Kaut. III. 11, Manu VIII. 68 ( = Kāt. 351 and Vas. 16.30), Kāt. 348 provide 490 that ordinarily witnesses should be of the same varna or caste as the parties, that women should be witnesses in disputes between women, that men of the lowest castes (rentyajas) should be witnesses for litigants of those castes and that a litigant of a lower caste should not try to prove his case by citing witnesses of a higher caste or a brāhmana (unless the latter is an attesting witness on a deed ). But most (even including Gaut. and Manu ) give an option and say that persons of all castes (even sūdras) may be witnesses for all. Vide Gaut. XIII. 3, Manu VIII. 69, Yāj. II. 69, Nār. IV. 154, Vas. 16.29 (sarveșu saria eru vā). Nār. 1V. 155 and Kāt. (349-50 9. by Aparārka p. 666 and V.

Kaut. III. 11, Manu VIII. 65, Vişnu Dh. S. VIII. I and several others say that the king cannot be cited as a witness 495 ( except possibly to prove the plea of res judicata or to prove what transpired before him when a litigation was going on ). 

The above is a formidable list of incompetent witnesses ; therefore, most Smrtis such as Gaut, XIII. 9, Kauţ. III. 11, Manu VIII. 72, Yāj. II. 72, Nār. IV. 188-189, Vişnu Dh. S. III. 6, Uśanas (q. in Sm. C. II. p. 79), Kāt. 365-366 ( 9. in Sm. C. II. p. 79) expressly point out that strict examination of the character of witnegges should be entered upon in disputes about debts and 

494, In Omichand v. Barker ( Willes 1737-1860 p. 538 ) where Willes (Lord Chief Justice) says (at p. 551) that in Popish times and for some little time afterwards till the Reformatiop was fully established there was a notion that 'even an alien friend especially if he were an infidel could not sue in a court of justice here'. That shows how non-Christians found it difficult to sue in England for their just rights a few centuries back. In the case cited above Lord Chief Justice Willes had to deliver an elaborate judg ment ia 1745 for holding that evidence taken in India according to the oaths administered to non-Christian witnesses could be read in a trial beld in England. So one need not laugh at Nār, who flourished at least about 1200 years before that date if he held an atheist or an apostate to be an incom peteot witness. It should be noted that 'By the canon Law a jew is not admitted to give evidence against a Christian, especially if he be a clergyman;' vide Taylor on Evidence (ed, of 1848, p. 655 note C.)

the like which are of a fixed nature (of a civil nature ), but that in complaints about all kinds of sāhasa ( heinous crime), in robbery, adultery or the two kinds of pārusya ( viz. defama tion and assault) there should be no (strict) inquiry into the character of witnesses (that is, all can be witnesses in such cases) and that even those like slaves and fault-finders who have been enumerated among incompetent witnesses can become witnesses in grave matters 4%. The idea is that in such cases the witnesses need not be strictly examined as to their possess ing the good qualities ordinarily required in witnesses. But this does not authorize the examination of such persons as lunatics or idiots as witnesses, because they have not the power to understand things. Manu VIII. 77 emphatically states that even a single male, if he is free from greed, may be (suffi cient as ) a witness, but not women of good character, even though they be many, since the feminine intellect is apt to be unsteady. But even Manu had to concede (VIII. 70) that a woman or a minor or a very old person or a pupil, relative, slave or a hired servant may be a ( competent) witness, if it is impossible to find another witness (in matters that occurred inside a house or in a forest or in crimes where life is lost). Kat. 367 (g. by Aparārka p. 671) says the same thing. Usanas497 (quoted in the Sm. C. II. p. 79, V. P. p. 120) provides that even a slave, a blind man, a deaf person, a leper, a woman, a minor, a very old man may be ( competent) witnesses in sāhasa, provided they are not interested in the matter of dispute (or are not related or partial to the parties). Nar. (IV. 190 191) gives it as his view that even when there is to be no strict inquiry into the character of witnesses in sāhasa, still a minor, a woman, a single person, one who forges deeds (or who is a

cheat), a relative and an enemy cannot be witnesses in sāhasa, since a child through ignorance, a woman from her habit of untruthfulness, a forger (or cheat) because he is accustomed to doing evil deeds, a relative from affection and an enemy from the idea of taking revenge may speak falsely. There was no total disqualification of women as witnesses, since Manu quoted above allows them to be witnesses in disputes between women and in cases where it is not possible to have other witnesses. Medhā - tithi on Manu VIII. 68 holds that women are. disqualified as witnesses only where the plaintiff and defendant are both males but that where there is a litigation between a man and a woman or between women alone, a woman may be a competent witness. Ancient Hindu Law is not singular in its partial rejection of the testimony of women, Vide Best on Evidence (12th ed. of 1922) pp. 53-56 where it is shown how ancient Roman Law and the Medieval laws of several countries of Europe more or less excluded the testimony of women, how some States in the U.S.A. excluded the testimony of negroes and persons of coloured blood. By the Canon Law more credit was given to male than female witnesses ( Taylor on Evidence, ed. of 1848 p. 655, 

noted). 

Nar. (IV. 157-172) states that incompetent witnesses fall into five classes : (1) some t98 like learned brahmanas, very old men, ascetics, persons practising austerities are incompetent because ancient texts ( vacana) say so and there is no other (special) reason for their exclusion.

Five classes of incompetent witnesses 

339 

(p. 214 ) points out that śrotriyas and others cannot be appoint ed as witnesses, but they may be what is called akyta witnesses explained below (i. e. they may if they choose appear as witnesses in a cause ). They are not competent like the king, not because they are untrustworthy but because it is not advisa. ble to call them. They were privileged persons; (2) thieves, robbers, dangerous characters, gamblers, assasins are declared to be incompetent because there is the defect (doşa) of untruth fulness in them; (3) witnesses are rendered incompetent on the ground of contradiction (bheda), when the statement of wit nesses who have been accepted by the king for determination of the same matter do not agree; (4) he who without having been appointed (by the parties to a transaction ) as a witness (to it) comes of his own accord to depose is termed a sūci (i. e. & spy) in the sāstras (and so was styled svayamukti by Nār. IV. 157) and is unworthy to be a witness; (5) a person is incompetent as a witness by reason of intervening death (i. e. he is mstāntara ); when can any person bear testimony if the creditor (or claimant) is no longer alive, whose claim should have been heard by him specifically (but was not heard in that way )? Mītāntara is a witness whom one or other of the parties informed in a general way that there was some dealing between the parties and who was asked to be a witness ( but was not told the details of the dealing ) and then subsequently the party died. In such a case the person told is not a good witness, as he cannot give the details. But Nār. (IV. 94 ) mentions an exception to this last rule viz. when a father while on the point of death tells his sons and the like these are the witnesses on such and such a matter,' there even after the father's death those witnesses would be competent though death intervenes. 

Witnesses are divided by Nār. IV. 149 into two sorts ; (1) those appointed (kyta) by the parties and (2) those not appointed (akrta); the first being of five kinds and the last of six kinds. The first five ( acc. to Nār. IV. 150 ) are a subscrib ing witness (likhita), one who has been reminded (smārita ) 1. e. one who is called as a witness without there being a docu ment and who is present at a transaction and is again and again reminded of it by a party to it in order that the transaction may be effectively proved thereafter ( Kāt. 371 and 372 q. in Mit. on Yaj. II. 68 ), a casual witness i, e. one, who, while a transaction is being entered into, comes there by mere chance and is then asked to be a witness (yadrochabhijiā or yādşcchika, 

340 

History of Dharmasastra 

| Vol. 

acc. to Br. ), a secret witness i, e, one who is made to listen to the speech of the debtor while concealed behind a wall or soreen, an indirect (uttara )499 witness (i. e. one who learns from a witness who has seen or heard of a transaction when the latter is going to a distant country or is on the point of death ). The six akrta witnesses (acc. to Nār. IV. 151-152) are co-villagers (in disputes about boundaries), the chief judge, the king (before whom a suit was tried), one who is closely acquainted with the transaction of the parties (i.e, kūryamadhyagata, acc. to Bs.), one who is deputed by a party (for borrowing an ornament or for settling a transaction, called dutaka by Br. ), members of the family (kulya) in disputes among other members of the family (as regards partition &c.). Bộ. mentions twelve kinds of witnesses that are practically the same as the eleven of Nār. except one which he adds viz. lekhita 500 (one whose name is caused to be written by a party in the presence of the witness when that party enters into some transaction in writing such as a loan with another). The only difference between 'likhita' and 'lokhita' seems to be that the first himself writes his own name as a witness on a document while the latter's name is written as a witness by one party in the presence of the other and of the witness. Br. (S. B. E. vol. 33 p. 299 verses 4-15 q. by Aparārka pp. 666-667) defines at great length all the twelve and Kat. also defines most of them, but these defini tions are passed over as not very important. Viśvarūpa remarks that these nice distinctions among eleven kinds of witnesses are made only for the sake of exposition and for the benefit of simple people 507

Shaking the credit of a witness 

341 

Before a witness for a party begins to depose, it is the duty of the opposite party to point out the ground or grounds, if any, of the incompetence of the witness put forward for examination, Kāt. adds 502 that the latent defects of the witnesses of a party must be pointed out by the opposite party, but the patent defects will be considered by the members of the court at the time of giving their decision. Vyasa 503 states the defects of the witnesses of a party should be pointed out by the opponent in open court by putting them down in writing and the wit nesses should be called upon (by the judge) to refute them; if the witnesses admit (the faults pointed out) they do not deserve to be witnesses; if otherwise (if the faults are not admitted) they should be established by the opponent with evidence (other than those of other witnesses ); for if the defects of the witnesses of a party were allowed to be established by other witnesses to be cited by the opponent, there would result the fault of a never-ending series (anavasthā), since the first party would then try to show defects in the latter set of witnesses and this may have to be carried on ad infinitum.' Bř. laid down that an opponent should not be allowed to point out the grounds of incompetency in witnesses after they have begun to depose and Kat. adds 504 that he (that party), who points out, after the witnesses have deposed to a matter, faults in them in whom he found none at first and who can not set out a proper reason (for his not proclaiming the faults at first) should be fined in

the first amercement. Br. further states sos that-the defendant may point out the defects, if they exist, in the witnesses oited by the plaintiff; but if he finds faults which do not exist in the witnesses, he should be punished with a fine equal to the amount claimed (in monetary disputes) or equal to that which is levied from a false witness. If the witness of a party is not able to refute the defect pointed out by the opponent, the party calling him should try to clear his witness of the fault; other wise he should not succeed in his suit. 

When a witness is about 506 to depose, he was, acc, to Br. (S. B. E. 33 p. 302 v. 23), to put off his shoes and turban, raise his right hand (in order to draw the attention of the Court) and after touching gold, cowdung or darbha grass was to depose to the truth. Ap. Dh. S. II. 11. 29. 7. says 507 that a witness should depose to the truth on an auspicious day in the morning in the presence of kindled fire and near (a jar of) water in the hall presided over by the king (or chief justice) and after being exhorted as regards both (viz. the results of truthfulness and falsehood) and when accepted by all (the court and parties ) as a competent witness. Kaut. also (in III. 11 ) says that wit nesses should be examined in the presence of brāhmaṇas, water jar and fire. Manu (VIII. 79-80) provides that the judge should in a conciliatory manner exhort all witnesses assembled inside the court in the presence of the plaintiff and defen dant as follows: 'whatever acts of these two (litigants) between themselves you know as regards this matter (in dispute ), narrate them all truthfully, since you are the witnesses in this case'. Yaj. II. 73 also states that witnesses should be made to depose in the presence of the parties and Gaut. XIII. 13 and Kāt. (q. by Mit. on Yaj. II, 73) prescribe that witnesses sos

Examination of witnesses

should face the east or north, are to be examined in the presence of the images of gods and brāhmaṇas in the first half of the day and should be exhorted to tell the truth by being bound with oaths. This examination in the public and after an oath went a long way in checking the tendency to depose falsely. The oath consisted of two parts, viz. (1) the requirement to tell the truth and (2) the exhortatory and imprecatory part. Both were administered by the presiding judge. Gaut. (XII. 12-13) appears to prescribe that an oath (sapatha) was not to be administered to brāhmaṇa witness, but Manu VIII. 113 ( Nār. IV. 199) does not make this distinction. Gaut. (XIII. 14-23), Manu VIII. 81-86, 89-101, Vişnu Dh. S. VIII. 24-37, Nar. IV. 201-228 contain very long exhortations addressed by the judge to the witnesses relating to the importance and high worth of truth, stating how the conscience of a man pricks him, what rewards await the truthful witness here and in the next world and what sin and terrible torments in Hell are the lot of an untruthful witness, what evil befalls even the deceased ancestors of an untruthful witness and how he is liable to be punished by the king.

with the word 'speak', while VIII, 113 states that a brāhmana is to be made to swear by his truth. Some explain that the first rule applies to excellent brāhmaṇas and the second to inferior ones and rely on Gaut. (XII. 12-13 ) who prescribes that an oath to speak the truth is not to be administered to brahmanas but only to others. Vide Haradatta on Gaut. and Vivādacandra p. 127. Manu VIII. 102 (Baud. Dh. S. I. 5. 95 ) is careful to point out that the exhortation is not to depend purely on the caste but that brāhmaṇas (and others ) who tend kine, who engage in trade, who are craftsmen or actors, who are menial servants and usurers should be treated (by the judge) as sūdras 511 (in the matter of taking oaths). Witnesses after they are assembled before the Court are to be ordinarily examined separately (vide Kāt. quoted in n. 508 above). But Gaut. XIII. 5 and Kat, 394 provide 5'2 that if a certain matter is seen by the witnesses as a body then they may be examined together. Manu VIII. 78 and Kat. 392 prescribe that what the witnesses declare quite natu rally (without hesitation and fear) should be taken down and that when the witnesses have declared (what they know) they should not be questioned again and again by the king (or judge). From the Smrtis and the 9th Act of the Mșcchakaţika it appears that 

511. The Mit, on Yaj. II. 73 explains Manu VIII, 113 as follows: a brābmapa witness is to be sworn by being told that if he spoke untruth his truth will perish, a ksatriya that his vehicle and arms will be fruitless, a vaisya that his cattle, grain and gold will be lost and a sūdra that all sins will be his lot. Others explain differently. The Vyavahāratattva p. 215 says 

MANTEATR Tegri TUTTATHUra Faria e uri. The i t on Tr. II. 74 says the same. Med hātithi on Manu VIII, 113 appears to hold that the exhortatory part is repeated by the witness.

Cross examination

it was the chief judge or the judges who put questions and that there was no elaborate cross-examination and re-examina tion of witnesses as in England ( which practice is followed in modern India ). The only cross examination that appears to have been allowed was about the faults or grounds that made a person an incompetent witness. In this respect ancient Indian practice resembled modern judicial practice in some European513. countries other than England. Witnesses were compelled to attend. Kaut. III. 11 states that witnesses who are not far removed by time or space should be produced by the parties themselves, but those who are far away or who are unwilling to stir sball be got summoned by order of the king 514 Manu VII. 107, Yāj. II. 77, Br., Kāt. and Vişņu Dh. S. VIII. 37 say that if a witness knowing all facts and not prevented from coming by disease or similar causes refuses to come as a witness he incurs the sin of false witness, has to pay the amount in dispute and ten per cent thereof as fine to the king. This is in accor dance with the principle enforced in modern times that it is the duty of a citizen to appear before a court of justice when. summoned. Kaut. (III. 1) provides for subsistence allowance to witnesses. It is not quite clear whether parties could be regarded under ancient Hindu Law as competent witnesses on their own behalf. Yāj. (II. 13-15) appears to suggest that. parties could be regarded as witnesses in their own cause and held to be false from their demeanour as in the case of witnesses. Kaut. IV.515 8 and the 9th Act of the Mrochakatika show that the accused was questioned by the Court as to his movements about the time of the alleged offence and till his arrest. Sukra 516

XII, where on p. 431 he remarks .cross examination is a highly characteristic part of an English trial, whether civil or criminal, and hardly any of the contrasts between the English and continental systems strikes an English lawyer so forcibly as its absence in the continental system.'

IV: 5.-184 defines siksi in such a way as to exclude the litigant himself. Ordinarily witnesses were examined in the open court in the présence of the parties and never behind their back, but Kat. (387-389) prescribes that in the case of immovable property oral evidence may be taken on the property itself and in some cases even elsewhere than these two (viz. the Court and immovable property ), that is, in the case of the death of living beings witnesses may be made to depose before the corpse (of the animal killed ) or, in the absence of the body, before $17 some niark ( such as the horn of an animal). Bộ, and Manu VIII. 25 state that the truth of the statements of witnesses should be examined by marking their tone, their change of colour, their eyes, their gestures, and their deineanour518 Texts like Sankha. Likhita (4. by V. P. p. 124 ), Nār. IV. 193-196, Vispu Dh. S. VIT, 18, Yaj. II. 13-15 and Kāt. 386 point out the actions and appearances of a party or witness that deposes falsely, viz. he appears restless, changes his place (i.e. Inoves from one spot to another), licks the corners of his lips, his forehead perspires, his face loses colour, he frequently coughs and heaves frequent sighs, he scratches the ground with his feet (tues ), waves his hands and garment, his mouth becomes dry and his voice falters, he speaks incoherently, talks too much though not asked and does not reply straight to the questions asked and avoids meeting the eyes of the questioner. Such a witness may be looked upon as untrue and the king or judge should bring him under discipline (so that he will be afraid to lie). Merely on seeing these signs a witness was not to be punished or entirely disbelieved, since these signs raise only a probability of untruthfulness ( as remarked by Mit. on Yāj. 11. 15 and V. P. pi 124).

those who are 

hore disinterested 

le meritorious 

When there are many witnesses but they differ in their statements certain rules are laid down by Manu VIII. 73 (=Vişņu Dh. 8. VIII. 39), Yāj. II. 78, Nār. IV. 229, Bf. (8. B. E. vol. 38 p. 303 v. 35 ), Kāt. ( 408 ). They are briefly these : 519 The statement of the majority of witnesses should be accepted, but if they are equally divided then the statement of those who are more pure (in character or more disinterested ) should be accepted and if the meritorious are divided equally then those who are the best among them should be accepted as true. The Mit. on Yāj. II. 78 adds that if there is a conflict of testimony between the statements of a few but eminently qualified witnesses on the one hand and those of a larger number of ordinary witnesses, then the former should be accepted as Yāj. II. 7% requires i. e. it prefers quality to mere numbers. Kaut. III. 11 prescribes that when there is conflict in the oral evidence the decision should be according to the evidence of the inajority of witnesses or of those who are pure in character or of those who are approved of by both sides as good witnesses or a mean should be drawn from their statements. Nār. IV. 160 and Kāt. 359 state 520 that if one out of the (three) witnesses attesting a docu ment or out of (three ) witnesses that aro cited by a party deposes in a way contradictory to what is deposed to by the other twn, then all the three become incompetent witnesses on account of contradiction. This has been interpreted by the Vyavabāra. mitrkā (p. 326 ) to mean that where all witnesses are of equal status and there is a majority of only one favouring one side, then all the witnesses are incompetent and oral evidence is in that case futile for decision. 

The important question is how much has to be proved by the party calling witnesses. Yāj. II. 79 (=Visņu Dh. S. VIII. 38), Nār. II. 27 and Br. (q. by Sm. C. II. 91 ) state the general rule that that party whose averments are supported in their entirety as true by the witnesses becomes successful, while that litigant

IV. 232 and 234, Kāt. 396, 398 lay down 52 the rule that in civil disputes that are of a non-urgent nature (like recovery of debts ), if witnesses depose to more or less ( than what is averred in the plaint), then the claim is not established in its entirety; where the witnesses depose to more or less ( than the claim affirmed by the party) the deposition of the witnesses should be considered as not taken down or it should be omitted (from consideration ) 523; the witnesses in such a case are not liable to fine; they may deserve to be fined if they do not depose ( to what they know). Similarly Nār. IV. 233 and Kat. 524 399 say. that where the depositions of witnesses are in conflict as to the place, the time, the property, the amount, the colour, the species (or caste ), the form (or shape ), the age ( as stated in the pleading of a party ), the depositions are to be regarded as good as not given at all. The rule amounts to this that any dis crepancy between the essential details or particulars of a claim

523. The maxim (in Yaj.

II: 20)'in claims coataining several items, the creditor (or plaistiff) secures a decree for as much out of them as he is able to establish by means of witnesses'. These two verses are sought to be reconciled in various ways by the Mit. (on Yāj. II. 20), the Sm. C. II. pp. 120-121, Vyavabāra-mātņkā pp.310-312 (where it criticizes the views of Yogloka), V.P., pp. 98-102. It is impossible for want of space to go into these interpretat ious. The Mit says that Kāt. 473 applies to a case where the son or the jiko being igaorant of the debis contracted by his father or the like says 'I do not know' i.e. pleads ignorance. In that case he does not deny (he is not Hihnava-vādin but only ajfūnin. The Vyavahāranirnaya p. 68 ex plains Kāt. 473 in the same way and about 396 it adds that when he cites witacsses as supporting his entire claim and the witnesses depose only to a. part of it or to more than he avers then his claim fails in its entirety but in sāhasa, theft and adultery it is otherwise.

made in the plaint (such as the time, place, number &c.) and the case made out in the depositions as to any of these: essential particulars will have the same consequence as tendering no oral evidence. This rule was not followed to the letter and besides other means of proof could be resorted to, as stated by the Mit., the Vivādacandra and others 525, Kaut. III. 11 526 states that when the witnesses depose to less than what is averted in the plaint, the plaintiff has to pay a fine (of a fifth part) on the excess and when they depose to more than the claim, the excess (held proved on the depositions ) may be taken by the king. 

• In charges of adultery, heinous crimes (sāhasa ) and theft the whole of the matter that is alleged may be held proved, when witnesses depose to only a part of the matter 527 (says Kat. 397). 

Nārada IV. 165 prescribes that a litigants28 should not secret ly approach a witness cited by his opponent, nor should he try to win him over (by bribes or threats) through another; if he does so, he would suffer the consequences of a losing party (hina)... 

There were rules about the late production of evidence. It has been already shown how if a litigant adduces weak evidence, though strong evidence is available, he would not be allowed to rely on the latter after judgment is pronounced. It is said by Nār. I. 62 that when a lawsuit has proceeded far enough (lit, has been cleansed or thrashed out), evidence such as a

document or witnesses, would then become useless, if that evidence had not been announced before 529 After a reply is filed by the defendant, the plaintiff has to give a list of his evidence i. e. documents or witnesses (Yaj. II. 7). The meaning briefly is as follows: If he does not do so, proceeds with the trial and does not call all necessary witnesses or produce all documents and the case is almost finished, but judgment is not pronounced, even then he would not be allowed to produce fresh evidence at that late stage. For if fresh evidence not previously disclosed were allowed to be given at that late stage, it would cause surprise to the defendant, who would then demand time for adducing evidence in rebuttal and then the plaintiff may again cite further evidence and this process is in danger of being carried on ad infinitum. If however witnesses were already cited but all were not examined (e. g. if ten witnesses were mentioned and only three examined) and the plaintiff found that the evidence of the few witnesses examined for him is contradictory or hostile, then he may be allowed to produce even at a late stage the remaining witnesses ( who may be seven i. e, double the number of those already examined or who may be more respectable or purer in character ). This proposition is contained in Yaj. II. 80 on which the Mitakşarā remarks that even if witnesses are not mentioned in a list, but before judgment is pronounced other more reliable or respectable witnesses or double in number (and of the same status as ) of those examined are available, they should be examined by the court even at a late stage. The rule is that as long as witnesses are available resort to ordeals should not be had. Yāj. II. 80 also has given rise to various interpretations. Vide Mit. and Aparārka on Yaj. IL 80, Sm. C. II. p. 94, V. P. p. 130-134. The Mit. thinks that the verse applies where the plaintiff or the party on whom lies the burden of proving a positive proposition finds that the witnesses pro duced by him are hostile or contradictory and that in such a case he may be allowed to cite other more respectable or more numerous witnesses to prove his proposition and to show that the first set of witnesses is false, while Apararka holds that the verge says that when the party who has to prove his

case oites witnesses which the opponent feels are falso, tha opponent may produce more respectable or more numerous witnesses to depuse to the contrary and he would thus provo the first set to be false. Aparārka relies on Kāt. (408) for this proposition $30. It may be said that Aparārka's interpretation appears more natural. V. P. (p. 134 ) accepts Kātyāyana, but Bays that the interpretation of the Mit. ( of Yaj. II. 80 ) is correct.' Whatever view is accepted it leads to this that one set of witnesses not only may prove the truth of a party's case but also establish that another set of that party's witnesses are guilty of perjury. 

Yaj. II. 82 provides that if a witness, having promised with other witnesses to depose to a state of things, denies at the time of his examination that he saw the matter in dispute, he should be fined eight times the amount that a defeated litigant would have to pay and a brāhmaṇa witness similarly guilty if unable to pay may be banished (or his house should be razed to the ground). Nār. IV. 197 says that such a person is worse than a false witness. Manu VIII. 107, Yāj. II. 76, and Kāt. ( 405 ) pres cribe that if a person who has witnessed a transaction does not depose (1. e. remains silent) about it, though not suffering from disease or some other calamity, he should be made (after waiting for three fortnights) to pay the amount of the debt or other matter in dispute and also one-tenth thereof as fine to the king. 

After the witnesses have deposed the chief justice and sablıyas have to consider the depositions of witnesses ( as Kat. 340 provides ) $31, The Court has to find out which set of wit nesses are to be believed and what witnesses are perjured. Perjury entailed, according to dharmaśāstra works, both secular and other-worldly consequences. Ap. Dh. S. (II. 11.29. 8-9) states: 'When a witness deposes falsely the king should fine him and, in addition, the witness incurs hell after death' and Gaut. provides (XIII: 7 and 23), 'a witness telling the truth goes to heaven, but falls into hell if he does the reverse and when he deposes falsely he is to be censured and fined'. Manu VUI. 118 states that witnesses depose falsely through covetousness,

wrong Ideas, fear, friendship, sexual passion, wrath, ignorance and minority and prescribes (VII. 120-122) varying finos for. perjury arising from these several causes. Bļ. (S. B, E. vol. 33 p. 301 v. 21) regards 532 a corrupt judge, a perjured witness and the murderer of a brahmaņa as equally sinful. Yaj. II. 81 and Kat. (407) prescribe 533 that the litigant who procures perjured evidence and the witnesses guilty of perjury should each be separately fined double the amount of the fine prescribed for defeat in various disputes and a brāhmana (guilty of doing the same) should be banished from the country 534 (but not fined). But when a person (of any of the three castes other than brāh mana) is frequently guilty of perjury he should be fined and given physical punishment (as cutting the tongue or death) and a similarly guilty brāhmaṇa should be fined and banished (or degraded by being carried naked through the streets or deprived of his house ). The Mit. on Yaj. II. 81 says that when Manu prescribes (VIII. 380) that a brāhmana guilty of a sin is not to be awarded death or corporal punishment and that he is to be banished with all his wealth, he refers to the brāhmaṇa being a first offender and not a confirmed one. Manu VIII. 108 says * where within seven days from deposing in a cause a (serious or painful) disease or fire or the death of a relative befalls a witness, he should be (being held as a false witness owing to these portentous happenings ) made to pay the debt in dispute to the opposite side and a fine to the king.' The Sm. C. (II. p. 94) explains that this applies to a witness who is the only one on a disputed matter such as a messenger and the king or judge should wait for seven days to see whether any of these calamities befalls that witness and then hold him to be perjured. Kāt. (410) contains 535 a similar rule, but he states that the king should wait one, two or three weeks or up to 45 days according to the value of the matter in dispute and the caste of the deponent. Manu VIII 117 (=Vişnu Dh. S. VIII. 40) prescribes that in

S. XX. 14-16 or Tai A. X. 3-5), or with the three verses beginning with 'yaddevā deyahedanam' or with the verse sacred to Varupa (viz. Rg, I.. 24. 15, 'uduttamam varupa') or with three verses of which waters' are the deity (Rg. X. 9.1-3. apo hi stha )'. Vispu Dh. S. VIII. 17 adds that a sūdra guilty of perjury in the above case may by way of expiation feed ten cows for one day. It is strange that the dharmaśāstra works should permit perjury to save a culprit from being sentenced to death. Probably popular sentiment of old standing allowing the speak ing of falsehood in certain cases was responsible for this. In the Mahābhārata frequent reference is made to the permission to speak untruth in ordinary life when one's own life or another's life is in imminent danger. Vide Santi 536 45. 35, 109. 19. It is stated in Santi 165. 30 that speaking falsely is not a sin in five cases viz. in jest, to women, at the time of (i.e. in bringing about) a marriage, for the preservation of great wealth and for one's life. Vas. 16. 36 mentions those five occasions somewhat differently. Vide Manu VIII. 112 also for a similar rule. But bo old a sage as Gaut. ( 23. 29) implies that he disapproves of this sentiment 537, when he states, according to some falsehood entails no fault (i. e. no expiation need be performed) in (bringing about or breaking promises made at)

Nār. (IV. 235-236 ) states that when through 538 the caren lessness of the creditor (who dies ) there is no document nor witness to prove a dabt and the defendant denies it, then one of three methods (of proof) may be resorted to, viz. codanā pratikūlam ( Cunning the debtor each time to repay ), yuldtilega (putting forth arguments) and sapathu (special oaths and ordeals)538. Kat. (233 q. by Sm. C. IL. p. 52 and Par. M. III. 91) has a similar verse. Yukti according to Nārada IV. 238 means $39 * the creditor should follow ( the debtor) by arguments and by himself remembering and by reminding the debtor of the time, the place, the relation (subsisting between the two)'. Others. interpret yukti differently, that is, it means 'logical reasoning Kāt. (214) defines 540 'yukti' as 'the ascertainment or know ledge of a linya' (i. e. a sign that leads on to an inference ).

Circumstantial evidence 

355 

It is stated by Bphaspati that anumāna ( inference 541 or pre sumption ), as a means of deciding a law suit, is of three kinde, but it is inferior to witnesses ( vide note 433 above). Vyāga (q. by Sm. C. II. p. 95) states that anumāna is the same as hetu and tarka. V. P: (p. 167) remarks that (long continued) possession and the frequent urging by the creditor both lead to the inference of title and the taking of a loan respectively and are therefore to be comprehended under yukli according to the definition of Kātyāyana. Yet by popular usage yukli is res tricted to presumptions arising from certain circumstances on the analogy of the maxim of 'goballvarda' explained below under steya'. Yukti therefore means circumstantial evidence from which an inference may be drawn about a fact in issue in a judical poceeding. Ap. Dh. 542 S. II. 11. 29. 6 says that in case of doubt (judges ) should decide from signs (i. e. by inference ) or divine proof ( ordeals). Vas. 19. 39 mentions the view of some sages that one who is found armed or wounded or in possession of thë booty (stolen ) may be declared to be ( the thief or offender). Manu IX. 270 (=Matsya 227.166 ) requires the just king not to condemn to death one accused of theft unless his guilt is proved as certain by proof that the accused had in his possession the articles stolen and tools for theft (for house-breaking). "An adulterer is proved 513 to be so by being caught in such acts as playing with the hair of another's wife, an incendiary by being caught with a firebrand in his hand ( near the house set on fira), a murderer by being found ( near the murdered man) armed and a thief when caught with some of the articles stolen in his possession -Bay Sankba-Likhita 544

Kaut. 545 IV. 12 and Yaj. II. 283 similarly say that adultery may be inferred from ( the man and woman) being caught in the act of dalliance with the hair or from the signe left (such as marks of nails or teeth on the lips, check &c.) after carnal enjoyment or from the admission of the woman concerned (or of both ). Nār. (IV. 172-175) declares that there are six kinds of disputes in which the indications (or circumstances) themselves serve as witnesses and lead to a conclusion without the testimony of witnesses viz. one found with a fire-brand in his hand (near the scene of arson ) may be inferred to be the incendiary, one armed 546 ( found near the scene of murder ) as the murderer, one caught dallying with the hair of another's wife as an adulterer, one with a spade in his hand near a breached embankment as the person who caused the breach in it and one armed with an axe as the feller of a tree, a person guilty of an assault may be inferred to be go from visible signs (such as his club or sword being smeared with blood). But Nār. IV. 176 gives the warning that in such cases it is necessary to be careful in arriving at a conclusion, since a person in order to bring into trouble another whom he hates may create marks of injury on himself. Kāt. (337-338 ) further provides 557 that where one litigant proves as against his opponent (such as a debtor) either the offer of a bribe, or the effacing of the meang of recognition (such as effacing one's signature on a document) or holding out tempta tions (to the witnesses or sabhyas ) or the concealment of his wealth (to avoid its being attached in execution of a decree ), there the original claim (such as a debt) may be presumed to be proved oven if he (the opponent) denies his liability.

Dangers of circumstantial evidence 

357 

Judges often repeat from the Bench the words ' witnesses may lie, but circumstances cannot'. But this 80-called maxim is often dangerous. Circumstantial evidence leads to conclusionis that are in several instances false. The ancient Hindu lawyers were quite aware of the dangers of drawing inferences from circumstantial evidence. Nārada's warning has already been mentioned (p. 356). Kauț. 548 ( in IV. 8 ) remarks: 'even one not a thief may by chance be on the way by which thieves pass and one meeting thieves is seen to be apprehended as a thief because he is mixed up in dress, arms and articles carried with the thieves or is found near the articles stolen, just as Mandavya though not a thief declared himself to be a thief for fear of being subjected to torture; therefore (the king ) should punish one only after thorough examination'. Māndavya's is a leading case on the danger of relying on purely circumstantial evidence. Bșhaspati 549 also remarks that'a decision should not be arrived at merely by relying on the words of texts ; for, if judges come to a conclusion without applying careful reasoning, loss of dharma results; a thief is held to be not a thief and a good man is held to be a wicked one in a judical proceeding ( not arrived at with proper reasoning). The sage Māndavya was held to be a thief on account of the decision being arrived at without proper reasoning *550. 

The 9th Act of the Mṛcchakatika is a standing literary condemnation of conclusions about guilt drawn from circun stantial evidence and of how judicial procedure is vitiated (of vyavahāra-duştatā, as the author says in Act I). 

Nār. IV. 289 provides that when even circumstantial evi dence and presumptions therefrom do not enable the court to arrive at a decision, the judge should press the litigant with

kapathas (oaths and ordeals ) according to the place, time and strength of the litigant, such as fire, water, his spiritual merit and others. Manu VIII. 109 also says that when there are no witnesses the truth would have to be found out by sapathas. Divine proof is called daivikikriyā or samayakriya (Vişnu Dh. 8. IX. 1). Some writers make a distinction between sapathas ( special oaths) and ordeals ( divyas ), others (like Manu VIII.. 109-114, Nār. IV. 239 ) do not. For example, the Vivādacandra quotes Nār. IV. 247 when there is no witness in a dispute between litigants, there the judge should decide by means of ordeals 551 and various sapathas'. Acc. to the Mit. (on Yaj. II. 96 ) and S. V. (p. 106 ) both special oaths and ordeals are divine proof ( divya pramūna), but in disputes of small value sapathas ( oaths) were generally employed, while ordeals were resorted to only in serious disputes or crimes. The Mit.(on Yāj. II. 96), the V. May. p. 46 and V. P. (p. 170) state that ordeals are those that generally end in immediate decision of the dispute, while sap ithas take time for decision ( because after the oath the king has to wait for a week or more to see whether a calamity befalls the person taking the special oath). Vyasa -quoted by Sm. C. II. p. 96 employs the word sapathas for both 

special oaths (taken as to one's 'satya') and ordeals like balance. Sankha-Likhita state that divine proofs are the balance, eating poison, entering fire, holding & piece of (hot) iron, offering one's merit acquired by sacrifices and charity and the king should make him undergo other sapathas 552 Břhaspati says that where documents or witnesses do not lead to a certain decision or wbere inference from circumstantial evidence also is confusing, there the matter is to be decided by divine proof 553. 

Special oaths were taken not only in judicial proceedings, but also in ordinary dealings to clinch one's assertion or to clear one's character or reputation. Nār. (IV. 243-244) refers to

the special oaths taken for clearing themselves by Vasistha when he was suspected to be a yātudhāna (a demon or sorcerer) and by the seven sages together with Indra, who (Bages) were suspected to have stolen lotus fibres (by each among them 554 ). Manu VIIL 110 also speaks of the sapatha taken by Vasiştha before Sudās, son of Pijavana ( when the sage was charged by Viśvāmitra with the offence of devouring his own hundred sons). Nārada (IV. 243) refers to Rg. VII. 104. 15-16 in the first of which Vasiştha made the imprecation, sss “May I die this very day if I am a yātudhūna or if I injured the life of a human being! May he who falsely addressed me as yātudhāna be deprived of his ten valiant sons'! Manu VIII. 110 also refers to the same hymn 555, Manu VIII. 113(=Nār. IV.199) referred to above (p. 343) states the various oaths to be taken or adıninistered to the parties according to their respective castes. Manu VIII. 114 further pro vides for special oaths for litigants by touching the heads of their sons and wives. That sapatha taken by satya was common in very ancient times appears from Pān. V. 4. 66 (satyād-aśapathe ).557 Nār. IV. 249 prescribes that in charges of grave offences ordeals may be resorted to and sapathas in matters of small moment. Nār. IV. 248 mentions' truth, horses and arms, kine, grains and gold, the feet of (the images of) gods and the ancestors, acts of charity and good deeds ( suksta) are to be employed in sapathas as declared by Manu.' Bṛhaspati 558 enumerates the special

Vide Best on ‘Evidence' (12th ed, of 1922 ) pp. 42-45 sections 56-59 for the employment of oaths in all ancient societies in courts 29 well as outside, for the foros and sanctions of oaths and for the arguments urged against their use,

oaths mentioned by Manu and Nār. and adds that they are to be employed in small matters ( civil and, criminal). The Vişnu Dh. 8. (IX. 5-10) prescribes that when the litigant is a sūdra and the dispute relates to a matter worth less than one, two, three, four or five kronalas he should swear respectively by holding in his hand dūrvā grass, segame, silver, gold or earth taken from ploughed land, that (IX, 11-12 ) beyond that value various ordeals may be offered and that oaths with similar objects in the hands may be offered to vaisyas, ksatriyas and brāhmaṇas when the value of the subject matter is double, three times or four times of the value in the case of a sūdra. Manu VIII. 111 gives the admonition that a wise man should not make a false oath, because by so doing he incurs loss (of reputation) here and after death (by falling into Hell). Yāj. II. 236 prescribes a fine of 100 panas for one who takes an improper or profane oath 559 

The benefit of doubt is to be given, according to modern ideas on the administration of justice, to the accused. This principle was put forward several centuries before Christ by Ap. Dh, S. II. 5. 11.2 'the king should not punish when there is a doubt' (about a man's guilt 560 ).

CHAPTER XIV 

ORDEALS 

A brief history of ordeals may be get out here. Rg. I. 158. 4-5, wherein 561 the sage Dirghatamas, son of Ucatha, prays that the fire of faggots heaped tenfold may not burn him and that the rivers in which he was thrown bound hand and foot may not engulf him, are regarded by some as a reference to the ordeal of fire and water. Yet in those verses there is probably no reference to ordeals, but to the cruel treatment of Dirghatanas by dūsas headed by Traitana. Rg. III. 53. 22 also, where it 562 is said 'he beats the axe (or acc. to Sāyana 'just as the tree is injured by contact with the axe &c.')', does not contain a clear or certain reference to the ordeal of holding the heated axe. Atharvaveda 563 II. 12 is held by several Western scholars to contain a reference to the fire ordeal. This also is far from certain, though verse 8 may lend some support to that view $64. The Pancavimša (or Tāndya ) Brāhmaṇa 14. 6. 6 refers 565 to the story of Vatsa, who was abused by his step-brother that the former was the son of a südra woman, against which Vatsa protested, urged that he was a brāhmaṇa, entered fire to prove the truth of his assertion and came out of fire unscathed. This is referred to by Manu VIII, 116. This is probably the earliest

and clearest reference in ancient Sanskrit Literature to the fire ordeal. Next comes the reference to holding in the hand the heated head of an axe by a person accused of theft to prove his innocence contained in the Chandogya 566 Upanişad VI. 16.1. Ap. Db. S. II. 11. 29. 6 refers to inference and divine proof (quoted above n. 542). In another place (II. 5. 11. 3) Apastamba states that after carefully considering ( the charge before him ) by means of divine proof and questioning ( of witnesses ) the king should get about awarding punishment. Sankha-Likhita (n. 552 ) name four ordeals, viz. those of balance, poison, water and holding red-hot iron 567. Manu VIII. 114 mentions only two viz. the holding of fire (i. e, red-hot iron) in the hand or plunging in water, but Nār. IV. 251 states that Manu declared five kinds of ordeals. Yāj. II. 95, Vişnu Dh. S. IX-XIV and Nār. IV. 252 mention five viz. balance, fire, water, poison and koša ( consecrated water ). Narada, however, knew two more viz. taptamāşa (IV. 343) and tandula (IV. 337). Bphaspati (S. B. E. vol. 33 p. 315 Verses 4 and 5 ) and Pitāmaha speak of nine ( Apararka pp. 628, 694 respectively ).

That ordeals had attained great vogue in the early centuries of the Christian era is shown by the "Mṛcchakatika Act IX. 43 (where the ordeals of poison, water, balance and fire are expressly named) and by Bāņa who mentions the same four in Kādambari, para 47 568 Among the digests and commentaries the Mitākşarā, the Smộticandrikā, the Divyatattva of Raghunandana, the Vyavahāramayukha and the Vyavahāraprakāśa contain the most elaborate treatment of ordeals 569

Use of ordeals

Divya is defined as that which decides a matter (in dispute) not determined by human means of proof '(V. Mayukha ) or 'that which decides what cannot be or is not to be decided by human means of proof' (Divyatattva 570 p. 574). Medhatithi on Manu VII. 116 discusses the question how ordeals can be relied upon for the discovery of truth. The objection is raised that fire and water are natural forces that act in a uniform way and are not intelligent beings which may change their minds by an appeal to them. Therefore, the objector says, ordeals and oaths are like magic and are only meant to frighten the parties into telling the truth. It is further objected that thieves may (by some trick) not be burnt in the fire ordeal and good men are seen to suffer. burns. The reply is: the usefulness of ordeals cannot be negatived by these examples of failures, as they are not frequent and as even direct perception and in ference sometimes lead to uncertain results. No one, however, says that these latter should not be relied upon. Just as one relies on witnesses in deciding a matter (who may for aught one knows be telling lies), 80 reliance can be placed on ordeals. Where there is failure in case of ordeals, it must be held to be due to the results of the performer's actions in past lives. The general rule as stated by Yāj. II. 2%, Nār. II. 29, IV. 239, Bphas pati 571, Kāt. ( 217 ) and Pitāmaha is that ordeals were to be resorted to only if no human evidence (witnesses, documents, possession) or circumstantial evidence was available. Kāt. (218-219) prescribes that 572 if one party relies on human means of proof and the other on divine proof, the king (or judge ) is to accept human means and not divine and that if human means of proof reach (i.e. are able to establish ) only a part of the allegations (in the plaint), then human means should be accepted and no divine modes of proof, even though they may be complete ( i.e. completely cover all allegations ). When Nār. II. 30 ( = IV. 241 ) states that divine' means of proof are to be resorted to when a transaction takes place in a forest, in

trial by ordesit is denied, or whomse, in cases of sūhasa 

a lonely place, at night, inside a house, in cages of sūhasa and when a deposit is denied, or when Kāt..(-230 ).prescribes that trial by ordeals is to be resorted to in the case of persons accus ed of committing sūhasa in secret (i.e. by wearing masks &c.), 573 those words only apply where it is impossible to have human evidence. Kāt. (229) states an exception to this viz. when the dispute 574 investigated is about sūhasa or about assault or abuse and defamation and in causes that spring from the use of force there is an option that witnesses or divina proof may be resorted to. Nār. IV. 242 states that divine proof could be resorted to when the chastity of women was in question, in theft and sāhasa and in all cases of the denial of monetary liability. Sita's ordeal of fire at once comes to mind as an illustration of Nārada's rule. Bphaspati 575 and Pitāmaha say that in disputes about immoveable property divine. proof should be avoided, which does not forbid divja altogether, but only where the evidence of neighbours or of a document is available and that in the latter case even if the defendant offers to pay a fine if he fails by the divine proof, ditya is not to be resorted to. The ordinary rule was that ordeals were to be administered to the defendant 576 (Kat. 411 =Vişnu Dh. S. IX. 21 ). But Yaj. II. 96 gives an option that any one of the two litigants may by mutual agreement undergo an ordeal and the other should agree to pay on defeat a fine or undergo physical punishment. This means that buman proof is adduced to prove a positive proposition, that divine proof may be resorted to prove a negative proposition as well (e. g. a defendant denying the claim for a debt may prove by dirya that he did got borrow a loan). Making an offer to pay a fine or undergo corporal punishment is said to be being sirsakastha 577 or sirastha

Employment of the several ordeals 

365 

(in Yaj. 95, Vişpu Dh. 8. IX. 20, 22, Pitāmaha, Nār. IV. 257, Kat. 412-413). Yaj. IL 95 prescribes that the ordeals of balance, fire, poison and water were to be prescribed in disputes of great value and not elsewhere and in II. 99. he says that all claims above 1000 panas ( of copper ) are to be regarded as of great value, but in charges of treason and of the commit. ting of any one of the five grave sing ( mahāpātakas ) any one of these four ordeals may be resorted to without regard to value and without any offer to pay fine on defeat. So also these four ordeals were to be offered to the defendant where the plaintiff offered to pay a fine on defeat. The ordeal of kosa was allowed in all claims whether of high value or low valne or whether the plaintiff offered to pay a fine on defeat or not. 

Yaj. II. 98 states that the ordeal of balance should be given to women, a minor (under 16 ), a very old person (above eighty years), the blind, the cripple, brāhmaṇas and the diseased; the fire ordeal (i. e. heated ploughshare and heated māşa) to kşatriyas, water ordeal to vaiśyas, poison to südras. Nār. IV. 335 assigns ordeals to the different varnas similarly. Nār. IV. 256 presoribes that ordeals should not be undergone by those who are observing a vow, who are much distressed or who are performing austerities, and by women. Pitāmaha quoted by Mit. (on Yāj. II. 98) adds minors and old persons to these. The Sm. O. II. p. 103 explains this ag referring to the ordeals of fire, poison and water only. Another Smrti (q. by Mit. on Yāj. II. 98) prescribes that the ordeals of balance and kośamay be offered to women, minors and the others mentioned above. There is in all these rules a spirit of tolerance, kindness and concern for the weaknesses of mankind. Kāt. (423) holds 578 that persons of the higher castes who are cowherds, traders, artisans, bards, domestic servants and usurers should be given ordeals as if they were sūdras. Kāt. (422) allows all ordeals to members of all castes, except that brāhmapas are not to undergo the poison ordeal Kāt. (424-426) prescribes that the ordeal of fire should not be offered to blacksmiths or those who are leprous nor of water to those who ply boats or who suffer from diffi. culty in breathing or cough, nor poison to those who are experts in incantations and yogic practices or who suffer from (excess

of) bile or phlegm, nor kosa to those who are drunkards, to persons fond of women, to gamblers and to those who are atheists. Vişnu Dh. 8. IX. 25, 29 and Nār. IV. 255, 332 contain similar provisions. Kāt. (427-430) further provides that no ordeal should be allowed to be performed personally by the following persons, viz. those charged with the murder of their father, mother, a brāhmaṇa, their teacher, a minor, a woman and the king; those guilty of the (five) grave sins; particularly those that are atheists; those who wear (or subsist by ) peculiar sect marks; great rogues; those who are experts in incantations and yoga practices; those who are the progeny of unions of persons of different varnas; those who repeatedly engage in sin; in the case of these the king should offer ordeals to good men appointed by them on their behalf and if such good men are not willing then they should appoint their own relatives. Sankha-Likhita also refer to the appointment of friends or relatives as representatives (Aparārka p. 842) 579. Kāt (433) 580 lays down the following rather remarkable pro Vision, viz. when untouchables, men of lowest castes, slaves, mlecchas and those born of mixed unions in the reverse order of the castes are guilty of crimes, the determination of their guilt (by the above mentioned ordeals) should not be made by the king; he should indicate such ordeals as are in vogue among them.

only when they cannot secure relatives or other persons appointed by them to undergo the usual ordeals on their behalf. The Vyavahāratattva (p. 579) explains that the ordeals referred to among mlecchas and others are the snake in the jar and the like. This seems to have consisted in taking out a ring or coin with the hand from a jar in which a snake was placed; if there was no snake bite or no effect even if the snake bit, the person was declared innocent. Vide note 580. Yāj. II. 97 and Nār. IV. 268, 320 prescribe that all ordeals are to be administered by the chief justice in the morning at sunrise or in the forenoon in the presence of the king, the sabhyas and brāhmaṇas. The Mit. adds that a Sunday is the proper day according to the usage of respectable people ( šiştas). Pitamaha specially provides that the water ordeal should be administered in the noon and poison in the last watch of the night (Mit. on Yāj. II. 97). Certain seasons and months were either appro priate or inappropriate to certain ordeals e. g. Nār. IV. 254 states that the fire ordeal should be given in the rainy season, balance in the winter ( sisira), water in summer, poison when the season is cool. Nār. IV. 259 prohibits water ordeal in the cold season, fire in summer, poison in the rainy season and balance while the wind blows violently. The Mit. (on Yaj. II. 97) and Par. M. III. 162 quote Pitāmaha to the effeot that the months of Caitra, Vaisakha and Mārgasirsa are common to all ordeals, koša and balance may be administered in all months. 

As regards the place, Pitamaha prescribes that ordeals are to be administered by the king or the judge appointed by the king in the presence of learned brāhmaṇas and the public (or the ministers ) 581 Kat. ( 434-35 and 437 ) provides : 582 ordeals should be administered in some well-known temple in the cage of men accused of grave sins and near the royal gate in the case

of those charged with treason; in a public place where four roads meet in the case of those bora of mixed unions in the revarse order of castes, in oases other than these in the hall of justice. When ordeals are administered in an improper place or at an improper time and when they are performed outside human habitation (in a lonely place ) they fail as to the matter in hand ( i, e. they cease to be decisive ). Nār. IV. 265 prescribes that the balance should be planted in the hall of justice or at the royal gate or near a temple or where four roads meet. 

The procedure common to all ordeals and described in the Mit. on Yāj. II. 97 and 99, the V. May. pp. 52-55, V.P. pp. 183-186 (all relying on Pitāmaha ) and Vyavahāra-nirnaya pp. 148-53 (relying on Prajāpati, Pitamaha, Br.) is briefly as follows In ordeals the chief justice is to do every thing at the king's bidding as the adhuuryu priest does in all sacrifices. He should observe a fast and the sodhya (person undergoing the ordeal to clear himself) is also to do the same. Both are to bathe in the morning and the sodhya was to have his wet clothes on. The Chief Judge is to invoke the gods to the accompaniment of music and to offer flowers, sandal-wood paste and incense. He should fold his hands, face the east and invoke Dharma to be present at the ordeal (Dharma being the principal deity in ordeals ) and assign places to Indra, Yama, Varuna and Kubera in the four principal quarters from the east and to Agni and other guardians of quarters in the corners of the principal quarters. He is to contemplate on the eight deities of the eight quarters as having different colours (viz. Indra as yellow, Yama as dark &c.). He is to assign the eight Vasus (repeat ing their names) to the south of Indra, the twelve Adityas (repeating their names) between Indra and Iśāna (i. e, between east and north-east), assign a place to the eleven Rudras to the west of Agni, assign a place to the seven Mother goddesses between Yama and Nirsti ( between south and south west), assign a place to Ganesa to the north of Nirsti, to the Maruts ( seven) to the north of Varuņa; to the north of the balance (or the place of other ordeals) he should invoke Durga. All these deities are to be invoked with appropriate Vedio mantras (set out in. V. May.). . He should offer the geveral:items of worship from arghya ( water offered by way of honour) to ornament to Dharma (as the principal deity) and then to the subsidiary deities from Indra to Durga (according to appropriateness ) and then sandalwood paste, flowers, incense, lamp and naivedya to the deities from Dharma to Durga. The

flowers for Dharma are to be red. Up to this is the work of the Chief Justice. Sacrificial priests should offer into fire in the four quarters 108 oblations of clarified butter, boiled rice and fuel sticks with syllable Om and the Gayatri and with 'Om' and 'svāha' at the end of each. Having written down on a leaf the subject matter for which the party is undergoing ordeal the leaf should be placed on the head of the sodhya with the mantra, 583 'the sun, the moon, the wind, fire, heaven and earth, waters, the heart, Yama, day and night, the two twi. lights and Dharma know ( see or mark) the deeds of men'. 

The several ordeals will now be briefly described. 

First comes tula or dhata (balance). A sacrificial tree (such as khadira or udumbara ) should be cut to the accompani ment of vedic mantras ( employed in making a sacrificial post). Two wooden posts made of that tree should support a trans Verse beam (called akşa ). The posts should be fixed in the ground, the part above ground being four cubits and that below being two cubits. This frame should face the east (i. e. the posts must be in the south and north). Then the beam of the balance was to be made from the same tree and was to be suspended from the transverse beam of the frame by means of a hook. Three iron rings were to be fastened to the beam of the balance, two at the end and one in the middle for suspending the balance from the transverse beam by means of a chain or string. Two scales were to be suspended at the two ends of the beam by hooks and strings from the iron rings fixed at the ends of the beam. On the two sides of the balance there should be two arohes in which the scales should move and whioh should be ten angulas higher than the balance. There should be two perpendicular pendants made of clay hanging down from the arches and touching the upper surface of the balance In the pan to the west the sodhya should be placed and weighed against clay, bricks and stones placed in the other pan. Then traders or goldsmiths or braziers should examine the balance and bring it ott a level with the two pendants hanging down from the arches and examine the perfect horizontality of the

beam of the balance by spilling a little water on the beam. When the person sitting in one pan is equal in weight to the materials ( olay &o.) in the other, a line should be drawn with chalk by the experts on the arch ( to show the exact position of the pans). Then the man is made to get down from the pan and he is to invoke the balance as stated in Yaj. II. 101-102, 

O balance, you are the abode of truth, you were created by the gods for this purpose, declare the truth, free me from this (cloud of) suspicion, Mother! if I am a sinner then take me lower, if I am pure take me upwards'. The person is then to hear exhortations about the result of untruth after putting the writing on his head (vide Nār. IV. 276 and Visnu Dh, S. X. 9), then he is again to be placed in the pan to the accompaniment of invocations (Nār. IV. 278–279, Vişņu Dh. S. X. 10-11). A worthy brahmana learned in astronomy is to calculate the time of five palas 584 or vinā līs. Then his weight is again to be marked. If the person goes up (i. e. is found lighter than what he formerly weighed) he is declared innocent (acc. to the com. on Nār. IV. 283, V. Mayūkha p. 60, Dipakalikā on Yāj. II. 102); if he weighs the same or goes down (i. e. weighs more) he is guilty. Then the person concerned is to distribute gifts to the judge, the brāhmaṇas and sacrificial priests and take leave of the deities invoked. Bșhaspati (SBE vol. 33 p. 317 v. 19) states that he who weighs the same should be weighed once more. If the pan or the beam or the hooks break or the ropes give way owing to some visible cause then the procedure was to be repeated, but if the breaking is due to an unseen cause or accident, the person was to be declared guilty. . The ordeal of fire is as follows --Nine circles with cowdung are to be drawn from west to east, they being meant for Agni, Varupa, Vāyu, Yama, Indra, Kubera, Soma, Savitr and all gods. Each circle was to be 16 angulas in diameter and the space between two circles was to be 16 angulas. In each circle kusa grass was to be spread and the person to be tested was to plant his feet on them ; ghee was to be offered into fire 108 times. A blacksmith by birth should heat in fire a ball of iron weighing 50 palas (16 palas 585 in the case of a weak man) and eight 

584. A vināđi is the time required for reciting 60 long syllables and 60 vinādis make one ghagikā. So five vinādis will be equal to two minutes, *** 585. A pala weighed 320 gufljās according to the Liāvati (1. 4). Acc. to Divyatattva (p. 608) 20 palas were equal to 66 tolakas, five māşas and 4 guðjās, which, while accepting the view that a pala is equal to 320 guðjās, gives the rather modern measurement into tolākas (tolas).

angulas in length till it becomes red-hot and emits sparks. Then all the details described above ending with the placing of the writing on the head of the šodhya are to be gone through by the judge and the fire (in the red-hot piece ) is to be invoked with several mantras (such as Yaj. II. 104586 and Visņu Dh. S. XI. 11-12). The sodhja should stand in the first circle facing the east. Having niade red marks on all sores of the hands of the sodhya on which grains of rice have been rubbed, he (the judge ) should place seven leaves of the asvattha tree on them and also grains of rice and curds and should fasten round them threads. Then the judge should carry the red-hot iron piece by means of a pair of tongs and place it in the hands of the sodhya (that are covered with leaves). Then the sodhya holding in both his hands the red-hot piece should walk from the first to the eighth circle not hurriedly but slowly and at ease. Having reached the 8th 597 circle he should throw the red-hot iron piece on to the 9th circle. Then the judge should rub on the hands of the sodhya rice grains and wben the latter shows no hesitation at the rubbing and no injury on his hand at the end of the day he is declared to be innocent. Kat. ( 441 ) and Yāj. II. 107 provide that if the red-hot piece falls earlier (i. e. before reach ing the 8th circle) or there is a doubt ( whether his hands are injured or not) or if he loses his footing or is burnt elsewhere than on the hands he should again undergo the ordeal. 

The ordeal of water as described in the smrtis and digests is rather complicated. The Sm, C. ( II. p. 116 ) remarks that 588 as the ordeals of water and poison had gone out of yogue (in its day ) it passes over the procedure of these and takes up the description of kośa ordeal after the fire ordeal. Having gone to a reservoir of water the judge should get erected on its bank a torana ( an arch) as high as the ear of the sodhya on an even and cowdunged plot. He should offer worship to Varupa (Lord of waters), to a bow of middling size and to three arrows ( the points of which are made not of iron but of bamboo) with sandal

paste, incense, lamp, flowers. A target is to be fixed at the distance of 150 hastas (cubits ) from the torana. A post of some macred tree is to be fixed in the water and a strong man of one of the three higher castes free from love or hatred for the Šodhya is to stand in navel-deep water facing the east and holding the post. Then the judge is to make the sodhya stand in water, invoke the deities from Dharma to Durgā, perform all the rites up to the placing of the writing ( embodying the accusation) on the head of the sodhya. A kşatriya or a brāhmaṇa following the profession of arms who is of a pure heart and has observed a fast should discharge, while standing near the root of the torana, three arrows at the target. The sodhya should invoke the water with the mantra, 'O Varupa I save me by means of truth' ( Yaj. II. 108 ) 589 Then a young but swift man should run to the spot where the second arrow struck the ground, and stand there holding that arrow in his hand. Another swift man stands at the root of the torana whence the arrows were discharged. Then the judge claps his hands thrice. At the third clap the sodhya dives into the water seizing the thighs of the man standing in water and at the same time the swift man near the arch runs at his best speed to the place where the second arrow fell. The other man who holds the arrow starts off the moment the first runner reaches him and comes running to the arch. If he does not see the sodhya or sees only his head (i.e. the back of the head ) when he reaches the arch the sodhya is to be declared innocent ; but if he sees other parts of the head ( such as the ear or nose &c.) or if the sodhya floats to some part other than the ono where he dived he is not innocent.

gods and brāhmaṇas. The poison to be selected is tārniga (derived from the spāga plant) or vatsanābha (aconite ) or haimavata (Visnu Dh. S. XIII.3, Nār. IV.322 &c.). Pitāmaha (g. by Aparārka p. 712) treats the three as distinct, while Yāj. II. 111 appears to prescribe śārnga growing on the Himalaya as the poison to be selected. Višņu Dh. 8. (XIII, 2-3) also does the same. In the rains the quantity of poison is to be six yavas in weight, in summer five, in hemanta (and sisira) geven or eight and in sarad (autumn) less than the latter (i. e, six yavas acc. to Mit. and three acc. to V. Mayūkha). Poison is to be administered in the last watch of the night and never in the noon or after noon or twilight; it was to be mixed with ghee thirty times as much. It may be administered to any one except a brāh maņa. Viņpu Dh. S. XIII. 6-7 and Nār. IV. 325 are mantras with which the judge invokes poison and Yaj. II. 110 is the mantra which the sodhya repeats before taking poison viz. 'O poisonl thou art the son of Brahma, thou art firm in the duty of ( deciding) the truth. Save me from this accusation and be like nectar to me by truth (if I be innocent)'. Nār. IV. 326 states that then the sodhya should eat the poison, should be kept in shade without food and guarded the rest of the day and if he discloses no signs of the effect of poison should be declared innocent. If the dose of poison is large, the Mit. (on Yāj. II. 111) says that when the sodhya shows no change till five hundred clappings of hands then he should be declared to be innocent and medical treatment should be resorted to. Pita maha says that, in order to prevent fraud, for three or five nights before the ordeal the intending sodhya should be kept under the supervision of the king's servants and an examination should be made whether medicines, incantations or precious stones that are antidotes are secretly employed. 

The ordeal of kosa. The godhya is made to worship the stern deities (such as Rudra, Durgā, Aditya) with sandal wood paste, flowers ato, and made to bathe the images with water. Then the judge asks the sodhya to invoke the consecrated water with the mantrā* satyena mābhirakşı' (Yaj. II. 108) and makes him drink three handfuls (prasști ) of that water. Pitamaha gives some special rules. The water may be that of the bath of the image of that god of which the sodhya is a devotee or if he holds all images in equal esteem, then of the Sun. In the case of Durga it is her spike (śüla) that is to be bathed, the orb in the case of the Sun and the weapons in the case of other 

314

[ Vol. 

gods. The water of the bath of Durga is to be offered as ordeal to thieves and those who live by the profession of arms and the water of the bath of the Sun is not to be given to brāhmanas. In other divyas the result is declared immediately, but in the kośa ordeal there is a period of waiting which is more or less according to the value of the claim or the gravity of the offence. Acc. to Yaj. II. 113, Visnu Dh. S. 14. 4-5, Nār. IV. 330, if within fourteen days of taking the kośa ordeal the sodhya does not Buffer any serious calamity due to the king's action or the act of God or does not fall seriously ill or does not lose by death his son or wife or other dear relative or his wealth, then he is to be declared innocent. Insignificant loss or illness did not matter as it is unavoidable in this world. Besides, the calamity or illness must not be one common to several people (such as an epidemic). Drinking holy water ( košapāna) was employed not only as an ordeal for proving innocence, but it was resorted to also for assuring another about one's good will and future honesty (vide Rājat. V. 326 ). 

Ordeal of Tandula ( rice grains ). It is to be administered in charges of theft or disputes about debts or other monetary matters. On the preceding day grains of rice should be made white (i.e. husked ). The judge should perform all the rites on the previous day. The rice grains should be placed in an earthen vessel, exposed to the sun, water of the bath of (the image of the sun should be poured over them in the vessel and the vessel should be kept in that state the whole night. The next day in the morning the sodhya should swallow thrico the rice grains. He should be made to spit on a pippala or birch leaf. If blood is found mixed in his saliva he should be declared guilty. . 

Ordeal of taptamāşa ( heated piece of gold). In a vessel of copper, iron or clay sixteen angulas in diameter and four angulas deep, the judge should get twenty palas of ghee and oil poured and heat it to the boiling point. Then the judge should cast into it a golden piece weighing one māşaka ( equal to five gunjūs ). The sodhya should take out the heated golden piece with the thumb and the next two fingers. If he does not jerk his fingers or there is no scalded skin he should be declared to be innocent. Thera is another method. Cow's ghee should be poured in a vessel of gold, silver, copper, iron or olay and it should be beated to the boiling point so that when a green leaf is cast into it the sound churu' is produced. Into the 

HI

boiling ghee he should cast a golden, silver, copper or iron seal ring once washed. Then he should invoke the ghee with this mantra 'O gheel thou art the holiest thing in sacrifices, thou art nectar; burn him (the sodhya) if he is a sinner ; be cool as ice if he be innocent.' Then the sodhya takes out the ring from the boiling ghee. If there are no marks of scalding on his forofinger he is innocent. 

Ordeal by phāla (ploughshare). This is described by Bphaspati (S. B. E. vol. 33 p. 318 verse 28) quoted by the Sm. C. II. p.119, V.P. p. 218 and others. A ploughshare of iron weighing twelve palas, eight angulas long and four broad should be made red-hot and the thief should be made to lick it once with big tongue. If he is not burnt he establishes his innocence; if otherwise, he is guilty. The Vyavahāratattva (p. 608 ) mentions that acc. to Maithila writers the thief meant is a cattle-lifter. The ordeal mentioned in the Chāndogya Upanişad is a phala divja. 

Ordeal of dharma (i. e. of the images or pictures of Dharma). Men guilty of causing bodily injuries or who have monetary disputes or who desire to undergo this ordeal ag an expiation for sins should undergo this. A silver image of Dharma and a leaden or iron one of Adharma should be prepared or the judge should draw on a birch leaf or a piece of cloth figures or pictures of Dharma and Adharma respectively white and dark in colour. Having sprinkled pañcayavya over the two, he should worship them with white and dark flowers respectively. The images or figures should then be placed in two balls of clay or cowdung. The two balls should be then placed inside a new earthen vessel in a cowdunged spot in the presence of images of gods and in the presence of brāhmaṇas. Then the judge should perform all the rites from the invocation of Dharma to the placing of the writing on the head. The sodhya should repeat the words 

if I am free from guilt may (the image or picture of) Dharma come to my hands'. Saying this he should take out one ball from the vessel.,. If he takes out Dharma he is innocent. This resembles the dfawing of lots. 

Ordeals played their part in the judicial systems of most ancient countries. In early England handling of red-hot iron and plunging the hand in boiling water were the commonest ordeals. In the ordeal of water sinking was a sign of innocence and floating of guilt. Stephens ( History of Criminal Law of England, vol. I p. 73) suggests that the ordeal of water 

376

(Vol. 

was a form of honourable suicide. The Assize of Northampton (1116 A. D.) prescribed the ordeal of water for murder, robbery, theft, forgery and arson, but ordeals were abolished in England from 1215 A. D. (ibid. vol. I. p. 300). In India 591 there is epigra phic and other evidence to show that ordeals were resorted to till the end of the 18th century and rarely even later. In the Kittur Pillar Inscription (J, B. B. R. A. S. vol. IX. pp. 307-309) dated in Kaliyuga era 4289 in the reign of Kadamba king Jayakesideva there is a description of the phāladivya which was administered by mutual agreement on Sunday to an acārya Sivasakti who had a dispute about a plot of land with Kalyāņa sakti the ācārya of another shrine and whose hand was exami ned the next day after he underwent the ordeal by all the bankers of the agrahāra village Degāve. In the Silimpur stone slab Inscription of the time of Jayapāladeva (E. I. vol. XIII. p. 283 at p. 291-292) there is a reference to the ordeal of 

591. In Beal's 'Buddbist Records of the Western world,' vol. I. p. 84 (also Watters on Yuan Chwang's travels vol. I. p. 172) four kinds of ordeals are mentioned as in vogue, viz. by water, fire, weigbt and poison. In the water ordeal the accused is placed in a sack connected with a stone vessel and thrown into deep water. If the man sinks and the stone floats he is guilty: if the man floats and the stone sioks then he is pronounced fagocent. The ordeal by fire is: they beat a plate of iron and make the accused sit on it and again place his feet on it and apply it to the palms of bis bands: moreover he is made to pass bis tongue over it. If no scar results he is innocent; if there are scars his guilt is proved. In the ordeal by weight a man and a stone are placed evenly in a balance. If the accused is innocent the stone rises in the balance; if he is guilty the man rises and the stone falls. In the ordeal of poison an incision is made in the right thigh of a ram, all sorts of poison with a portion of the food of the accused are placed in the incised wound. If the man is guilty poison takes effect and the animal dies; if he is innocent the poison has no effect and the animal survives. It will be noticed that these descriptions of the four ordeals do not agree in several respects with the descriptions in the smrtis and digests, while the poison ordeal in Beal has nothing in common with the smrti poison ordeal. Alberudi (tr, by Sachau, vol. II, pp. 159-160) probably speaks of poison ordeal in the words * the accused person is invited to drink dish called brahmana' (ho is probably referring to poison being called the offspring of Brahmā in Yāj. II. 110 and Nār. IV. 325). In the ordeal of water the accused is simply thrown into a deep and rapidly flowing river or a deep well and he was held innocent if he was not drowned. He describes the kośa ordeal and balance ordeal accurately, but states that if the man has spoken the truth be weighs more than before. He describes correctly taptamaşa (gold piece taken from boiling clarified butter) and also the ordeal of the red-hot iron piece

balance 59 (about 1200 A. D.). The Vişnukundin king Madhava varman in the 7th century A. D. (Journal of Andhra Historical Research Society, vol. VI pp. 17, 20, 24) is said to have carried out various ordeals (avasita-vividha-divijah). The E. C. vol. III (Mandyā Taluka Ing. No.79 p. 47) records that a dispute having arisen about the boundaries of land bestowed by means of a copperplate grant by the Hoysala king Vira-Narasimhadeva, one Kannaya, a descendant of the original donee, performed an ordeal by holding consecrated food in the presence of the God Hoysaleśvara in the capital Dorasamudra and came out suc cessful. E. C. IV. p. 27 ( Yelandur Jagir Ing. No. 2 page 27, about 1580 A, D.) is a charter to potters whose headmen under went the ordeal of dipping their hands in boiling ghee as against barbers and washermen who denied that potters could pare their toe nails and tie on upper cloth (at the time of marriage). In the Indian Antiquary for 1931 (vol. 60 p. 179) an extract is cited from the Archæological Report for Travancore 1930 which describes the balance ordeal undergone by a brāhmaṇa 18 years before and seen by the writer himself in the temple of Siya at Calicut. For the ordeal of red-hot ploughshare in the case of thefts, vide Report of South Indian Epigraphy for 1907, para. 27. 

In the times of the Maratha kings ordeals were resorted to. For example, in 'Peshwa's Diaries' vol. 2 p. 150 (in 1764-65 A, D.) mention is made of taptakaļāha ordeal (i. e. taking out a coin or ring or a piece of metal from a large vessel in which either water or oil or ghee had been brought to the boiling point) in which the person undergoing it had his right hand burnt up to the middle joints of the fingers and was declared to be false. In a Marathi publication called 'Vatanpatrem, nivādapatrem &c.' pp. 46-56 edited by P. V. Mavjee and D. B. Parasnis (1909) there is a document which describes in great detail the ordeal of fire undergone in connection with a dispute about the office and emoluments of Deshpande in the district of Kalyan in sake 1666 Pausa bright 11th, Thursday (1745 A. D.). It is stated therein that the ordeal was performed on the tank of the sacred river Godavari at Kopargaon in accordance with Dharmaśāstra in the presence of the Peshwa himself and learned brāhmaṇas and panditas near the temple of the god Sri Suklesvara, that as the opponent was long in

possession the ordeal had to be performed by the man claiming title, that an iron ball of 50 palas (i. e. 166 tolas and two māsas) was heated red-hot and the sodhya carried it across seven circles and threw it in the 8th circle on flour and bundles which began to burn, that his hands were examined in the presence of the opponent and the respectable people and were found unaffected and the opponent was made to pass a docu. ment of victory to the sodhya called 'yejitapatra'. The des cription agrees very closely with that given above. In the same work at pp. 36-41 there is a remarkable description about an ordeal undergone (in 1742 A. D.) by Mahomedan litigants in their own mosque for 15 days by lighting lamps and sitting down in the shrine. There are several other vatanpatras in the same work which refer to ordeals. 

For an informing article on divyas reference may be made to Dr. Dines Chandra Sirkar's "The successors 593 of the Sata vahanas' Appendix pp. 354-376 (Calcutta, 1939). He quotes therein a passage from the 'Asiatic Researches' vol. 1, from which it appears that a magistrate named Ali Ibrahim Khan at Benares tried by phala divya two cases in 1783 A. D. and reported them to the then Governor-General, Warren Hastings. In the * Txtiya-Bammelana-vrtta' (pp. 18-26) and in the Caturtha sammelana-vrtta pp. 100-154 of the Bhārata-itihāsa-samsodhaka mapdala at Poona (both in Marathi) Mr. Bhaskar Vaman Bhat contributes two thoughtful and scholary papers on the adminis tration of Justice in the times of the Marathas in which the part played by ordeals is described at some length. 

593. It is somewhat strange that Dr. Sirkar refers to ‘Divyatattva of Bphaspati' (in Successors of the Sātavābanas' Appendix p. 360). A Divya tattva of Raghunandana is well-known. A Divyatattva of Brbaspati has so far baca mcationed powhere. 

CHAPTER XV 

DECISION 

The last (i. e. 4th) stage in a judicial proceeding is siddhi (Yaj. II. 8) or nirnaya ( decision). If pratyākalita (as defined above on p. 298) is regarded as a pāda of vyavahāra (and since all are agreed that there are only four pādas) then the decision is not a pūda of a lawsuit but is the fruit thereof (V. P. p. 86). When the evidence has been led, the king (or chief justice ) should with the help of the sabhyas decide upon the success or failure of the plaintiff594, Nar. II. 42 says that the sabhyas should ask the parties to leave the court when they are considering their verdict or what decision was to be pronounced 5%. It is stated by Vyāsa and Sukra IV. 5. 271 that the decision of a case is based on eight sourceg 596 ( 6 acc. to Sukra) viz. the three pramāņas (possession, documents and witnesses ), logical inference, the usages of the country, sapathas (oaths and ordeals), the king's edict and the admission of the litigants. Pitāmaka prescribes that, in disputes where there are no witnesses, no possession nor documents and no recourse can be had to divine proof, there the king is the final deciding factor as he is the lord of all 597 

It is stated by Nārada II. 41 and 43 that, whether a party is defeated by his own admission or by his own conduct ( i. e. because he adduces false witnesses or forged documents) or

whether he is defeated after full trial and the adducing of proof, it is proper that the defeat should be declared by the sabhyas ( the judges) and that a Jayapatra (a document of success i.e. a judgment) should be given to the successful party couched in fitting terms. Several verses of Narada (quoted by Aparārka p.684), Brhaspati (S.B.E. vol. 33 p. 307 verse 19), Kat. (259-265), Vrddha-Vasistha (q. by Mit. on Yaj. II. 91 and Apararka. p. 684) and Vyasa. (Sm. C. II. p. 57 ) lay down the contents of the judgment 598. It was to contain a brief statement of the plaint, the reply, the evidence, the depositions of witnesses, discussion thereof, arguments, the smrti texts applicable, the opinion of the sabhyas, the decision and the relief granted, and should be signed by the chief justice and bear the royal seal. Vas. 19. 10 refers to precedents also in the decision of cases and the award ing of punishments (agamad-drstāntac-ca ). The Mit. quotes a smrti text (on Yaj. II. 91) that other members of the assembly ( who are not judges ) proficient in smrti may also sign the judgment to show that the decision is acceptable to them also, But this was not absolutely necessary, as is made clear by the Vivādacandra p. 146. Kāt. ( 256 ) applies the word pascātkāra 599 ( refutation) to a judgment containing the above particulars given after a complete contest, while he restricts the word jayapatra to a document (given by the judge ) when a plaintiff becomes what is called hinavādi (because he makes a change in his pleading or for similar cause ) and when there has been no complete trial of an action; and such a document embodies only what happened. Kaut. (III. 19) appears to employ the word 'pascatkara' in a somewhat different sense when he says 'the

person, who, when charged with murder, does not reply to the charge that very day, stands refuted' (i. e, is found guilty ) 600 The Mit. (on Yaj. II. 91 ) differing from Kat holds a jayapatra to be a judgment giving a summary of the plaint, the reply, the evidence and the decision, while when a plaintiff is defea ted for change of pleading or for default of appearance or for non-prosecution the document stating this is called 'hinapatraka'. It is to be regretted that ancient jayapatras in Sanskrit have not yet been discovered. In 25 Calcutta Weekly Notes pp. CXLII-III Dr. Jolly communicated the substance of a jayapatra, couched in ancient Javanese, engraved on a copper plate found in the island of Java and described by Dr. Brandes in a Dutch paper. That judgment is dated sake 849 (928 A.D.), relates to a dispute about a debt of one suvarna in which the plaintiff failed because he did not appear at the trial. At the end there are the signatures of four witnesses and the document is styled jayapatra at the end. Vide for the same jayapatra J. B. O, R. S. vol. VII pp. 117 ff. The late Mr. K. P. Jayaswal published in 24 Calcutta Weekly Notes (pp. CXLIX-CLVI) a jayapatra (text, translation and remarks) granted by the Hindu court of Mithilā in sake 1716 (1794 A, D.) and in J. B. O, R. S. vol. VI pp. 246-258, which strictly conforms to the rules of procedure laid down in the smrtis and nibandhas and is couched in dignified, technical and scrupulously formal language. It related to the ownership of a slave girl. Plaintiff at first made default in appearance; the judgment notes this and also refers to the restoration of the suit. The defendant raised an objection that a single witness to prove a matter was inadmissible. This objection was upheld. Then plaintiff prayed that he might be allowed to undergo an ordeal, but this request was disallowed as human proof was possible and plaintiff ultimately lost his suit. The judgment is written and signed by one Sacala miśra, who was the chief justice, and is addressed to other members of the sabhā, called dharmādhyakşas and panditas, seven of whom express their concurrence (sammati) at the top of the document. Vide Journal of the Bihar and Orissa Research Society vol. XXVIII for 1942 for nine Sanskrit jayapatras from the courts of Mithilā in the 18th and 19th centuries. 

The Mit. (on Yāj II. 91), and V. Mātrkā , p. 309 note that a jayapatra is given specially to prevent the same matter being

agitated again, while a document given where a party is hinavadi (i, e. a Ninapatraka) serves the purpose of making that party liable later on to pay a fine. When a dispute was decided by a domestic tribunal (kula &c.) there was no jayapatra but only & nirnaya-patra ( kuladibhir nirguye jayapatrabhāvān-nirnaya ptram tatra kāryam parattapatramiti yāvat, as the Vy. Nirnaya p. 85 says). It would be better to adopt the reading 'vrttapatram' as given by one Ms. 

The defeated party has to pay a fine to the king and the successful party was complimented (or honoured) by the king (or chief justice) and was to be put in possession of the matter that he succeeded in proving 601 Manu VIII. 51 prescribes that in monetary matters (i. e, in civil disputes) the defeated party should be made by the king to pay the judgment debt to the successful party and also some fine to the king according to his ability, while Manu VIII. 139 lays down that when the defendant admits in the court his liability he has to pay to the king five per cent as fine and if the defendant denied his liabi lity altogether and was proved to be false he had to pay as fine double of that (i. e. ten per cent). This is analogous to court fee, for which see above pp. 294–295. If one or both parties had laid down a stake or wager (viz. 'if I be defeated in this Bult I shall pay a hundred paņas') then he had to pay that stake to the king and a fine as above and the subject of dispute to the successful party (Yāj. II. 18 and Nār. II. 5) 602; compare Vispu Dh. S. V. 153-159 for similar rules. The punishments awarded in criminal matters will be discussed 

immediately below. . It would be necessary to see in what cases review of judg ment was allowed. The general rule is stated by Manu IX. 233, 'whenever any legal proceeding has been completed (tirita) or has been carried out so far as to recover a fine from the defeated party, a wise king shall not annul it' (at his mere will or pleasure or through greed). The words 'tirita' and

Meaning of Tirita and Anusista 

383 

anusista' have been variously explained 603. The word 'tirita' is very ancient and occurs in the Delhi Pillar Edict IV of Asoka (E. I. Vol. II. p. 253 ) as 'tilita-dandānam' qualifying men imprisoned in jails. Medhātithi and Kullūka explain them as 

decided according to the rules of the śāstra' and 'taken so far as to recover fine from the unsuccessful party' respectively. Kāt. (495) defines them differently: "When a certain side is decided by the sabhyas themselves (without the examination of witnesses ) to be either true or false, it is said to be tirita and that matter or side is called 'anusista' which is declared (to be true or false) on the testimony of witnesses." The lexcion called Vaijayanti seems to have Kāt. in mind and defines 'tirita' as a perverse decision given by the sabhyas themselves and 'anusista 'occurs where the evidence of witnesses makes what is true appear as false ( Bhūmikānda, vaiśyādhyāya, verses 11-12). Nār. II. 65 (S. B. E, vot 33 p. 22 ) employs the two words, which the Mit. on Yaj. II. 306 respectively explains as (tirita) ' decided by reliance on documents and witnesses but not carried so far as to recover a fine', and (*anušişta') as decided so far as to recover a fine from the defeated party'. Vide Apararka p. 866 and V. P. p. 90 for explanations. 

According to Kāt. quoted in the Vyavahārasāra (p. 101 ) 604 the decree should provide for the successful party receiving the interest on or accretions to the movable or immovable pro perty placed (during the pendency of the suit) in the hands of a third party (as a sort of Receiver). Kāt, (477-480) points 605 out the various ways in which a decree may be executed. The king should make a brāhmaṇa debtor return the decretal debt

to the judgment creditor by conciliatory words, should make other debtors return it according to the usage of the country and compel bad people to satisfy the decree by means of phy sical pain (i. e. imprisonment). The king should make a co sharer or friend (of the successful party ) pay the deoretal debt by means of a ruse (i. e. by borrowing an ornament or the like from him on a festive occasion and handing it over to the creditor) and also make traders, husbandmen and artisans (to pay) in a similar way. On finding that the debtor is un able to return the debt in cash, the king should make the debtor, whether a ksatriya, vaisya, sūdra or husbandman, work (for the creditor). If he be unable to work the debtor should be sent to jail except when he is a brāhmaņa. Manu also (IX. 229) says that if the members of the three varnas other than brāli maņa are unable to pay the fine imposed by the king they should be made to work for the king, but a brahmana may be allowed to pay in easy and small instalments. If a brāhmaṇa debtor was unable to pay, nothing could be done for recovery of the decretal debt except taking a surety from him if any one cared to be one. In modern times also judgment debtors are liable to be arrested and detained in civil jail in execution of decrees under rules 55-58 of the Indian Civil Procedure code (except women in execution of a decree for the payment of money). If in ancient times state policy exempted brāhmaṇas from arrest and detention in a civil jail for monetary debts on spiritual grounds and on the ground of caste, in modern times the State in Indra exempts agriculturists from arrest ar imprisonment in execution of a decree for money on economic grounds under certain legislative enactments like sec. 21 of the Deccan Agri culturists Relief Act (Bombay Act XVII of 1879). As regards women also Kat. ( 488-489) laid down certain prudent rules: "Women who are not 606 independent should not be arrested (for offences like adultery); it is the male who should be regarded as the offender; women should be punished by their lord (i, e. the person on whom they depend) but the king should take away for punishment the male offender. Even if a woman whose husband has gone abroad be consigned to jail she should be kept imprisoned only till he returns." The Sm. O. II. p. 323 explains that the first verse applies to a woman who can perform the

expiation for adultery and who is dependent and the adultery is not with a male of a lower caste. 

Nār. (II. 40) lays down 607 a qualification that when a party has been defeated by his own conduct (ie, by his demeanour or by his having adduced manifestly false witnesses or forged documents) there is to be no retrial or review of judgment, but where a man has lost his cause through (the dishonesty of) witnesses or the sabhyas, the cause may be tried anew. There are four exceptions to the finality of the judgments of the king's court. Where a litigant either through folly or insolence Gos thinks a decision to be wrong, he may be allowed a retrial, provided he agrees to pay double the fine inflicted on the losing party (Yaj. II. 306, Nār. I. 65, Kāt. 496). Secondly, where the former judgment is obtained by fraud or force, it may be set aside (Yāj. II. 31) 609, Thirdly, where the litigant was incompetent, i.e. was a woman or a minor or a lunatic or intoxicated, seriously ill or distressed by a calamity or where the proceeding was carried on by another on behalf of a litigant who did not appoint him or with whom he was not connected in any way or was held inside a house or outside a town or village (i. e, in a forest) or by an enemy, the decision may be set aside and a retrial ordered (Nar. I. 43 in S. B. E. vol. 33 p. 16, Yāj. II. 31-32). Fourthly, a king could set right a former decision of his predecessor which was unjust and arrived at through ignorance (Mit. on Yaj, II. 806 ) 610. 

Yaj. ( II. 4 and 303 ) prescribes that legal proceedings that are suspected to have been wrongly decided by the sabhyas through partiality or greed or intimidation should again be tried by the king and if the suspicion turns out to be true he should levy from the sabhyas and the party who at first succeeded double the fine that is imposed on a defeated party. Nar. 1. 66 (in 8. B. E. vol. 33 p. 22) is similar. Manu IX. 231 ( = Matsya 227. 158 )

and 234 prescribe that when officers appointed to administer justice cause loss to litigants by taking bribes, the king should deprive them of all their wealth and when the amatyas (ministers ) or chief justice disposes of a matter wrongly (but without being bribed ), the king should himself decide the matter correctly and should impose on the amātyas or chief justice a fine of 1000 panas. 

Though there is hardly any express smrti text for the transfer of cases from one court or judge to another court or judge, in practice this must have been done, though rarely. In "Seleotions from Peshwa's Daftar" vol. 43 p. 108 there is a letter (of 12-8-1764 A, D.) written by the renowned minister Nana Phadnis to the Peshwa Madhavrao in which the former endeavours to persuade the latter to cancel his order for transfer of a case from the court of Rāmsāstri, famed for his impartiali ty and strict life, to another judge on the ground that one of the litigants was afraid that Rāmsāstri showed some partiality to the other litigant. Manu (VIII. 174-175 ) states that the king who decides the causes of people unjustly through greed is soon subjugated by his enemies, while the king who curbing his own temper and desires impartially decides causes according to the dictates of śāstra becomes of one mind with his subjects as rivers merge in the ocean. Br. and Nār. I. 74 (S. B. E. vol. 33 p. 24) lay emphasis on both the secular and spiritual effects of doing even justice, saying that when the king gives decisions according to śāstra he spreads his fame in this world and secures Heaven 611 

A crime may be defined as an act or omission that breaks the law and is subject to public punishment. But all kinds of breaches of the law do not result in punishment; only some do. Those breaches are crimes which are deemed to be menaces to the conditions of existence of society, which society, the ruler or legislation recognises as preventible only through punishment. The menace is not that of the specific action, but the abstract menace inherent in that type of action. A breach that is held to be a crime at one time may even be held not to be a crime at another time or in another country. For example, adultery is a crime under the Indian Penal Code (sec. 497), while it is not a crime but a civil wrong in English Law.

Evolution of the idea of crimes 

387 

Many crimes and wrongs were sing and entailed secular punishments and also religious sanctions (viz. expiations, prāyascittas). Vide Manu IX, 236, 240, Bf. (S. B. E. vol. 33, P. 36%, verse 22 ) and Paithivasi quoted below 612 Maine in his * Ancient Law' chap. X (3rd ed. of 1866 ) examines ancient Western systems like those of Greece and Rome and makes the generalisation (p. 370) that the 'penal law of ancient communities is not the law of crimes; it is the law of wrongs or, to use the English technical word, of Torts. The person injured proceeds against the wrong-doer by an ordinary civil action and recovers compensation in the shape of money damages if he succeeds'. Dr. Priya Nath Sen in his Tagore Law Lectures on 'Hindu Jurisprudence '(1918, Lecture XII) rightly points out that this generalisation is not applicable to Ancient Hindu Law. It has already been shown (on pp. 264–266 ) that the king could of his own motion take cognisance of many wrongs called chalas, padas and aparādhas and it is clear that in such crimes as theft, assault, adultery, rape, and manslaughter the smrti texts do not prescribe only a money compensation to the person wronged, but corporal punishment in the first instance and monetary compensation in addition. Vide for example, Manu VIII. 287, Yāj. IL 22%, Bř. (SBE Vol. 33 p. 358 verses 9-10), Kat. (787) which prescribe a punishment for causing pain to the body or the loss of a limb and also the expenses of curing the person injured and some solatium to him. 613 Āp. Dh. S. (1. 9. 24. 1 and 4) lays down that the slayer of a ksatriya should give a thousand cows in order to remove the enmity (i. e. as compensation to rela tives ) and one bull in addition for expiation.614 The Chandogya Upanişad quoted above (p. 362 ) shows that a thief was punished with death in those early days. There is a passage in the Tai.S. II.

6.10.1 ( quoted in H. of Dh. vol. II. p. 151 n. 346 ) which states, * He who threatens a brāhmana should be made to pay a hundr ed, he who strikes a brahmana should be made to pay a thousand', It is rather doubtful whether the figures stated are fines or are meant as solatium to the wronged. In Rg. II. 32. 4 ( which also occurs in Tai. S. III. 3. 11. 5) the poet prays to Rākā 61s (the Full Moon personified) that she may be pleased to grant the boon of a valiant son, who would be satadāya'. Sayapa's rendering of this word as 'possessed of plentiful beritage or wealth' appears to be the right one. The words 'satadāyam viram 'in the Tai, S. III. 3. 11. 5 are translated by Prof. Keith as *a hero whose wergild is a hundred'. This is incorrect, confound ing as it does the ideas of western Germanic tribes with the Rgveda composed several millenniums earlier. It would be a strange thing to pray to a goddess for a son and at the same time to have in mind or refer to the price set upon him if he happened to be killed. 

The ancient smrti writers were quite aware of the several purposes served by punishments for crimes, 616 though they do pot develop a regular science of penology. The person wronged feels a great urge for revenge or retaliation and other men sympathise with that emotion. The individual, however, could not, in civilized societies, take the law into his own hands and therefore the State saw to it that the emotion for retaliation or revenge was to some degree satisfied by the adequate punishment of the wrongdoer. Yāj. II. 16 and Nār. I. 46 (SBE vol. 33 p. 17) state that when a person without complaining to the king sets about to secure what is denied by the opposite side or is doubtful he becomes liable to punishment and he also cannot secure the object he wants. 61662 In all ancient societies the lex talionis ( the law of retaliation, viz, an eye for an eye

V. 19 and Sankha-Likhita prescribe that with whatever limb 618 man of low caste offends against a brahmana, that very limb of his shall be cut off. Another and the most important purpose of punishment is deterrent. Punishment of the evil-doer serves as an example and a warning to all others that might be tempted to tread the paths of violence and crime. This aspect of punishment ( daņda ) has already been dwelt upon in the section on rajadharma (p. 21 ). The end sought to be served by punishment was the protection of society and the securing of its happiness. The Sāntiparva (15.5-6) remarks that people do not commit sins through fear of punish ment at the hands of the king, through fear of Yama and of the next world and through fear of others (i. e, publio opinion ).619 Gaut. XI. 28 derives the word dança from the root dam to restrain or to deter. This purpose of punishment is well brought out in the Mșcchakatika (X) when the sentence passed on Cārudatta for the alleged murder of Vasantasenā is proclaimed to the citizens by the executioners, 620 Another purpose of punishment is preventive i. e, if a culprit is imprisoned for an offence he is prevented or disabled from repeating the same offence or

In Hammurabi's Code (text tr. by C. H. W. Johns, 1903 ) sections 196 and 200 are: 'If a man has caused the loss of a gentleman's eye, bis eye one shall cause to be lost.

committing further offences for some time at least and if he be sentenced to death or transported for life or banished, the commission of offences by him is prevented for his life-time. Another purpose was that of reform or redemption of the evil doer. The punishment was deemed to be a sort of expiation, which purged the man of sinful promptings and reformed his character. Manu VIII. 318 ( =Vas. 19. 45 ) states that men who are guilty of crimes and have been punished by the king go to heaven, becoming pure like those who perform meritorious deeds. Medhātithi remarks on this verse that this applies only where the punishment is corporal and not merely monetary. It will be seen from the early sūtras like that of Gautama and from the Manusmrti that the more ancient criminal law in India was very severe and drastic, but that from the times of Yājāavalkya, Nār. and Bř. the rigour of punishments was lessened and softened and fines came to be the ordinary punishments for many crimes, as is noted by Fa Hien (399-400 A, D.) in relation to middle India (Madhyadeśa) under the Guptas apparently: The king governs without decapitation or other corporal punishments. Criminals are simply fined, lightly or heavily according to the circumstances. Even in circumstances of repeated attempts at wicked rebellion they only have their right hands cut off' (Legge, 1886 p. 43). This may be contrasted with the state of things depicted by Megasthenes 700 years earlier than Fa Hion: (Fragment XXVII p. 71) 'a person bearing false witness suffers mutilation of his extremities. He who maims anyone not only suffers loss of the same limb but his hand also is cut off. If he causes an artisan to lose his hand and eye he is put to death'. The Dasakumāracarita (II. p.56) states that the Mauryas conferred a boon on traders that for certain offences they were not to be sentenced to death, but were to be deprived of all their wealth and banished. The first separate Rock Edict of Ašoka at Dhauli (Corpus I. I. pp. 93, 97 ) shows that great Emperor's anxiety that his judicial officers should strive to see that there is no undeserved fettering or no undeserved harsh treatment. In India the list of capital offences at any time was much shorter than in the West. Stephens is constrained to admit that in England 'there can be no doubt that the legis lation of the 18th century in criminal matters was severe to the highest degree and destitute of any sort of principle or system' (His. of Cr. Law, vol. I. p. 471). As stated by Dr. Hart (in 'Way to justice' p. 94), at the beginning of the 19th century in England more than a hundred offences were

punishable by death. In 1832 a child was convicted at Lud gate Hill for stealing a box of paints worth two pence, was tried at the Old Bailey and hanged (vide 'In the service of youth', by Dr. J. M. Brew, 1943 chap. XV. p. 208). 

Manu VIII. 129, Yāj. I. 367 and Br. (S. B. E. 33 p. 387 verse 5), Vğddha-Hārita (7.195) speak of four methods of punishment ( dangla ) viz. by gentle admonition, by severe reproof, by fine and by corporal punishment and declare that these punishments may be inflicted separately or together according to the nature of the offence. 621 The first takes the form of saying you have not done a proper thing', the 2nd 'fie upon you who are a wrongdoer and guilty of adharma'. Br. lays down that preceptors, purohitas and sons should be sentenced to the punishment of wordy admonition, other persons who engage in disputes should be punished with reproof or fines and those guilty of mahāpatakas should be punished with corporal punishment. That admonition and reproof were two modes of punishment shows that ancient writers were alive to the notion that among very sensitive persons or in a very sensitive society verbal condemnation would be enough to achieve the main purposes of punishment. Bp. ( SBE vol. 33. p. 388 verse 8 ) states that the first two are within the privilege of the brāhmaṇa (appointed as chief justice) but fines and corporal punishment are to be inflicted by the king (on the recommendation of the chief justice, prūdvivākamate sthitaḥ ). The Mșcchakaţika (IX) bears this out when the judge says 'We have authority only to pronounce the judgment; as to the rest the king is the final authority (nirnaye vayan pramānam šeşe tu rüja). Gaut. XII. 51, Vas. 19.9, Manu VII. 16, VIIL 126 and Yaj. I. 368 (=Vfddha-Harita VII. 195–196), Bșhat Park sara p. 284, Kaut.

fact whether the offence 622 is repeated. This provision means that the dharmaśāstras did not hold that the same punishment must be meted out for the same offence irrespective of the antecedents, characteristics or physical and mental condition of the offender. They always took extenuating circumstances into account. Kaut. (I. 4), differing from the view of the ācāryas that there is no thing like danda for bringing under one's complete control all beings, gives his own opinion that, as a king whose control and punishments are most severe makes the subjects disgusted with him and as the king who deals mild punishments is disregarded by the people, the king should distribute punishments according to the deserts of the offenders and would then command respect. 623 One reason why some of the works on dharmaśāstra prescribe mild punishments is the doctrine of karmavipāka (a man committing certain sins is born in the next life afflicted with certain diseases or bodily deficiencies or is born as a low or filthy beast or bird). Vide Manu XI. 49-52, Yāj. III 207-216, Visnu Dh. S. 44-45. This doctrine will be dealt with later on under pātaka and prāyaścitta. Gaut. XII. 48 first provides that the king must take into account, when awarding punishment to the criminal, his physical or monetary circumstances, the nature of the crime, the fact of repetition of the crime and then adds that the king should award punishment after consulting an assembly of learned brāhmaṇas. The Dandaviveka (p. 36 ) quotes a verse in which the considerations that should weigh in award ing punishment are brought together viz. the offender's caste (as in Manu VIII. 337-338 for theft), the value of the thing, the extent or measure (as in Manu VIII. 320), use or usefulness of the thing with regard to which an offence is committed (as in Manu VIII.285), the person against whom an offence is committed (such as an idol or temple or king or brāhmaṇa), age, ability to pay),

qualities, time, place, the nature of the offence (whether it is repeated or is a first offence). The Rājatarangini (VIII. 158.) provides that in disputes where parties are in doubt as to their rights it is proper to award punishment with forbearance but where a man starts on an evil path of set purpose ( the king and officers) must award severe punishment. In modern times there are controversies among several schools of criminology. Some hold that every man has freedom to act criminally or not or to act in the way he does and that each man has complete moral responsibility for his own'acts. On the other hand there are some who go to the other extreme and propound that a so-called criminal act is mostly due to biological, physiological, patho logical or sociological conditions, to the upbringing and environment of the person charged with crime. They favour determinism. The ancient Indian writers do not enter into these speculations. But when they said that regard must be paid to time and place and other considerations they were faintly conscious of or were groping towards the ideas of the 2nd school. 

Fines are either fixed or not fixed (i.. variable). They range from a kākini to the confiscation of all wealth ; fixed fines were of three kinds called prathama sāhasa, madhyama sāhasa (middling amercement) and uttama sāhasa (bighest). These are Variously defined. According to Sankha-Likbita the first 624 amercement is fine from 24 panas to 91, the middling one is from 200 to 500 panas and the highest is from six hundred to 1000

There was great divergence of views about the metal in which the fines were to be paid. According to Vijñānesvara the figures of fines in such verses as Manu VIII. 378 (where no metal is specified ) the panas are those of copper, wbile according to Bharuchi ( quoted in S. V, p. 150 ) they are of gold. The S. V, remarks that local usage is to be followed, The V. Mayūkha (p. 255 ) states that in all texts (about fiaes) the mention of a number without specifying the object to which it refers is to be deemed to refer to panas, that pana is a copper piece one karsa in weight and that karsa is one fourth of a pala. Br. '(q. by Sm. C. II. p. 99) states that the tables in Manu (VIII. 132-136) beginning with the dust particle in a beam and ending with kārsāpana is to be followed in ordeals and fines. An interesting sidelight is shed on crimes and their punishments in the In scription of Calukya Vikramaditya V (dated saka 934) from Gadag which provides that the fines' for abuse, assault, for drawing out a dagger, for stabbing and for adultery by a bachelor were respectively 2 pagas, 12 panas, 3 gadyāṇas, 12 gadyānas and 3 gadyānas (vide.

in proportion to the value of the matter in dispute or the injury caused. Manu VIIL 138 ( =Vişnu Dh. S. IV. 10) states that the first, middling and highest fines are respectively 250, 500 and 1000 panas, while Yāj. I. 366 puts these respectively at 270, 540 and 1080. The Mit. explains that the lesser figures of Manu re present the fines to be awarded for offences committed without set purpose. Nār. ( sābasa, verses 7-8) prescribes that 100 paņas is the lowest limit of fines for the lowest kind of sāhasa, 500 is the lowest for middling sāhasa, 1000 is the lowest fine in what is called the highest amercement (and might include death penalty, forfeiture of all property, banishment, branding and cutting off of a limb). Fines were supposed to be lesser than corporal punishment. Kat. ( 490-493 ) lays 625 down the follow ing rules : Whatever figure of fine is prescribed in the smrti texts for a wrong it is to be paid to the king in papas of copper or their equivalent. Where the fine is said to be one-fourth or one half of a māşa, there it is a golden māşa that is meant; when the fine is declared in māşas, they are to be understood as those of silver and where the fine is declared in kļşņalas the same is to be understood; a māsa is myth of a kārşāpaņa.' The general rule that lesser punishment is to be inflicted on women is stated by Kāt. ( 487 ) 'In the case of all offences, women are to Buffer half of the fine in money which is prescribed for a male offender of the same kind ) and when the punishment is death for a male, the punishment for a woman would be the excision of a limb. 636 Kaut. (III. 3) provides:' a woman attains ability to enter into transactions on completion of 12 years and men when they are 16; if they disobey after that (i. e, after attaining majority ) the woman shall be fined twelve panas and a man twice that amount.' 627 Angiras quoted by the Mit.

III. 243 ) states that 628 an old man over eighty, a boy below sixteen, women and persons suffering from diseases are to be given half prayasoitta and Sankha quoted by the Mit. (on the same Verse) that a child less than five commits no crime nor sin by any act and is not to suffer any punishment nor to undergo a prayascitta 629, Under the Indian Penal Code, 800, 82, nothing is an offence which is done by a child under seven years of age. The severity of punishment depended on caste also. In the case of theft, Gaut. XII. 15-16, Manu VIII. 338-39 prescribe that a vaisya, a kşatriya and a brāhmaṇa should respectively be fined twice, four times and eight times of the fine to be imposed upon a sūdra for a theft, since each of these is deemed more and more aware of the heinousness of the crime. Kāt. ( 485 ) and Vyāsa state this as a general rule for all offences 630. In the case of abuse and defamation the scales are turned in favour of the higher castes as regards fines. Gaut. XII. 1, 8-12, Manu VIII. 267-268 (=Nār. pārusya 15-16), Yāj. II. 206-207 prescribe that a kşatriya or a vaisya or a sūdra abusing or defaming a brāhmaṇa was to be respectively punished with the fine of 100 paņas, 150 paņas and with corporal punishment (cutting off the tongue), while a brāhmana defaming & kşatriya, vaisya or sūdra was to be fined 50, 25 or 12 paņas respectively (nothing in the last case acc. to Gaut. XII. 13). In the case of adultery and rape the caste of the offender and of the woman concerned made great difference in the punishment awarded. For adultery with a woman of the same caste Yāj. II. 286 prescribed the highest amercement, the middling one when the paramour was of a higher caste, but if the male be of a lower caste than the woman, the male offender was sentenced to death and the woman had her ears cut off. Corporal punishment assumes (as pointed out by the Daņdaviveka p. 20) various forms accor ding as it is meant to cause only harassment (pain) or is

Harassment or pain may be inflicted by imprisonment, beating, putting fetters, by making ridiculous (by the complete shaving of the head, declaring the offence - by beat of drum in the presence of the convict, parading him through the streets on an ass ) and marking him with signs indicative of offences like theft. Manu (VIII. 125) provides that punishment may fall upon any one (or more) of ten places in the case of the three higher castes, viz. the private parts, the belly, the tongue (either whole or half), the hands, the feet, the eyes, the nose, the ears, wealth and the whole body; but a brāhmaṇa shall depart unhurt from the country (i, e. he is to be only banished). Br. (SBE, 33 p. 388 verses 9-10) speaks of fourteen places of punishment adding the neck, the thumb and index, the fore head, the lips, the hind part, hips, one half of the feet (to Mapu's ten) and omitting wealth and the whole body there from. Gaut. XII. 43, Kauţ. IV. 8, Manu (VIII. 125, 380-381 ), Yaj. II. 270, Nār. ( sahasa, 9-10), Vişņu V. 1-8, Br.

Punishments for a brāhmana offender

the king to keep & brahmapa offender in confinement in a secret place and give him bare maintenance or the king may make him do the work of guarding cattle for a month or a fortnight or make him perform other work not fit for a decent brahmapa. The Mit.' on Yāj. II. 270 explains that the mark of female private parts for violating, guru's bed, of a tavern for drinking the liquor called surā, a dog's foot for theft, of a headless corpse for brāhmana murder (as laid down by Manu 

IX. 237 and 240, Vişnu Dh. S. V. 4) is to be made on the forehead only if the offender (whether a brāhmaṇa or not) did not perform prāyascitta for those grave sins. Branding with marks appropriate to the crime committed were in vogue in Rome and in Britain up to 1699 (such as the mark of the letter M for murderers, T for thieves &c.). Vide Barnes' 'Story of punishment' p. 62. The Rā jatarangini (IV. 96-106) refers to a case in the reign of king Candrāpida of Kashmir when a brāhmana guilty of the murder of a brālmana was exempted from death sentence because of the smrti rule. Manu IX, 241 gives option that a brāhmana (unintentionally ) guilty of grave offences may be punished with the middle amercement or he may be banished from the realm keeping all his wealth. The punishments for a brahmana offender, according to Gaut. XII. 44, were preventing him from doing the same thing again, depriving him of all wealth, taking sureties from him, proclaiming him as a thief in the city banishment, putting on his forehead the mark indicative of his crime. Ap. Db.s. (II. 10.27. 16-17) 633 lays down that a brābmana guilty of murder, theft, forcible seizure of another's land, was to have his eyes covered over with cloth for the whole of his life (while a sūdra guilty of any of the three was to receive the death sentence ). Vrddha-Hārīta (VII.209-210) says that a brāhmaṇa should be branded on the body for all those offences that entailed corporal punishment for other offenders, that he should have his head shaved, that he should be deprived of all his property and banished from the realm. The force of popular feeling on the point of exempting a brāhmaṇa offender from the death sentence was so great that Elphinstone (Governor of Bombay) in Regu lation 14 of 1827, soc. IV (ol. 5) exempted brahmanas and women from death sentence even for murder where public feeling would

be shocked 634. It is not to be supposed that this exemption of the brahmana from the death sentence was unanimous or uni versal. Kāt. (806) contains this remarkable statement: 635 Even a brāhmana deserves to be killed if he be guilty of

II. p. 126. Medhātithi on Manu VIII, 125 makes it clear that the absence of a fine occurs only in the case of a brāhmana who was a first offender, who did not commit the offence with forethought and who was endowed with learning, good family and character. The Sm. C. II. p. 124 relying on Manu IX. 236 says that a brāhmaṇa could be imprisoned but he could not be subjected to such corporal punishment as cuttiog off a limb or wbipping. The Smrtis openly regarded the brāhmana's person as sacred and so saved his body. The smrtis endeavoured to reacb the ideal of the rule of law and succeeded to a great extent in doing so. They beld that every man, whatever his rank or condition, was subject to the ordinary law of the realm and amenable to the jurisdiction of the ordinary tribunals. The only differential treatment that we find is in the appointment of judges (pp. 272 273), in the order of taking up causes of litigants (p. 298), in the punishment for perjury (Manu VIII. 123-124), in the matter of corporal punishment. in abuse, defamation and assault (pp.395-397), in punishment for adultery, in the repayment of debts and in the punishment for theft, which was severer for a brahmana. It will be shown below that from the 13th century, as indicated by the Sm. C., S. V. and Madanarataa, differential punishments had gode out of vogue. The smrtis did not, like some modern freedom-loving people, declare the equality of all before the law on paper and in practice indulge in lynching. Further the smrtis required all offenders of whatever caste to be brought before the same tribunals. Maou VIII. 335 and Yaj. I. 358 emphasize that there is aone who is exempt from punishment in the king's court whether the person be the king's father or teacher or friend or mother or wife or a son or a family priest or brother or father-in law or maternal uncle. Sankha-Likhita and Kāt. (481) no doubt say that a king should not punish his parents, his family priest, teacher, near relatives, forest hermits, ascetics. But, as the Sm. C. II. p. 126 explains, the real meaning is not that the king is to allow these to escape scot-free, but that he should not inflict corporal punishments or fines on these, but should employ admonition or severe reproof towards them. The smrtis do not contain rules like those in the Indian Criminal Pro. Code entitling Europeans and Americans in India to claim a jury preponderantly composed of their countrymen and claiming trial only by the High Court or liko the privileges of the English Peers to be tried only by the House of Lords for felonies or the doctrine of the benefit of clergy abolished in 1827. Vide H. of Dh. vol. II. pp. 140-143 and 147-152 about certain privileges of brāhmanas.

Death sentence for a brahmana

causing abortion, if he be a thief (of gold) or if he kills a brāhmaṇa woman with a sharp Weapon or if he kills & chaste woman'. Kautilya (IV. 11) prescribes that a brāhmaṇa who aims at the kingdom or who forces entrance into the king's harem or who incites wild tribes or enemies (against his king ) or who foments disaffection (or rebellion) in forts, the country or the army should be sentenced to death by drowning. 636 The fact that Cārudatta, a brāhmapa, is represented as having been condemned to death by king Palaka in the Mrochakatika indicates that the sentence of death against brāhmaṇas was not entirely unheard of. It appears from Fick's 'Social organisation' &c. p. 212 that in many Jataka passages the execution of brāhmaṇas is referred to. 

The Sāntiparva chap. 268 contains an interesting dialogue between king Dyumatsena and his son prince Satyavat on the subject of the punishment of death, which contains some of the arguments forcibly urged in these days by those that are opposed to capital punishment altogether. The prince pleads that punishment should be light even for grave offences, that when the sentence of death is carried out in the case of robbers, 636a several innocent persons (such as the wife, the mother, the son of the condemned man) suffer great loss (and they may die also ), that if offenders give themselves up to priests, swear before them that they will never commit sin, they may be let off after undergoing penance, that if great men go astray their punishment should be proportionate to their greatness. The king replies that in former ages when people were most truthful, soft-hearted, and not hot-tempered the punishment of saying 'fie on you' sufficed, then vocal remonstrances and upbraidings sufficed, but in the later ages (of Kali) corporal punishment and death sentence bave to be resorted to and that some people are not deterred even by the fear of death sentence. 

A few remarks will be made on each of the several modes of punishment. The sentence of death was, acc. to Kām. XIV. 16, Sukra IV, 1.93, to be avoided even in the gravest offences

except for the offence of subverting the state.637 Vişnu Dh. 8. V. 1 provides that all persons except brāhmaṇas guilty of the mahāpātakas may be sentenced to death. But Manu IX. 236 says that this extreme penalty was to be awarded only if they performed no prāyascitta. Kaut. (IV. 11) prescribes death sentence for causing the death of any one with a sharp weapon. Vrddha-Hārsta (VII. 190) prescribes it for incendiaries, poisoners, murderers, robbers, bad characters, rogues and those guilty of grave sins. The death sentence was carried out in various ways such as by giving poison or by trampling at the feet of an elephant, or by a sharp weapon (like a sword), by being burnt or drowned 638. Impalement was a punishment pres cribed by Manu IX. 276 for thieves guilty of housebreaking by night ( after first cutting off their hands ), by Yāj. II. 273 for those who made another a captive or stole horses and elephants or killed another by the use of force and by Vrddha Hārita VII. 202 for the murderer of a brāhmaṇa or for one who killed a woman, a child or a cow. Death sentence by being trampled under the feet of an elephant continued up to the times of the Marathas. The Dasakumāracarita 4th Uochvāsa shows that & thief could be trampled upon by an elephant by way of punishment. Vide 'Selections from Peshwa's Daftar' (edited by Mr. G. S. Sardesai) vol. 43 No. 143 p. 114 ( dated 7-9-1775 A. D.), where out of seven dacoits of the Berad caste two were ordered to be trampled to death at the feet of an elephant 639 and five were ordered to be simply beheaded. Death sentence is said by the Dandaviveka (p. 20) to be simple 

śuddha), which is of two kinds, avicitra when the offender is beheaded ( with a sword), and citra or vicitra ( when the offender is impaled of burnt ) and it is mišra ( when his hands or feet or other limbs are cut off and then he is killed ) 640. Simple death

is prescribed by Manu IX. 271 for those who abet thieves by giving them subsistence, instruments of house-breaking or asylum, If a man of a low caste had sexual intercourse with a woman of a higher caste (with or without her consent) or kidnapped a maiden he was to be sentenced to death (Manu VIII. 366, Yāj. II. 286-288, 294). Vas. XXI. 1-5 prescribed for a śūdra, vaisya or ksatriya guilty of adultery with a brāhmaṇa woman the horrible punishment of being burnt to death after being respectively covered with virana grass, with red darbhas and sara leaves respectively and similar punishment for a śūdra paramour of a ksatriya or vaisya woman and for a vaisya paramour of a kşatriya woman. The consenting woman (adulteress) was, acc. to Vas. XXI. 1-3, to be shaved, to have her head anointed with clarifi ed butter and to be paraded naked on an ass and left to die on the Great Journey, while, acc. to Gaut. XXIII. 14 and Manu VIII. 371, an adulteress, vain of her charms or the wealth of her parents, was to be openly devoured by dogs, if her paramour was a man of lower caste. Sankha 641 prescribes this punishment ( of being devoured by dogs ) for a woman's paramour of a lower caste and for the erring woman death by burning. Vņddha-Harita VII. 192 prescribes that in the case of a woman who is a confirmed adul teress, or who destroys her foetus, her husband should have her ears, nose and lips cut off and then she should be banished and verses 220-221 prescribe death by being burnt with grass (katāgni) for those guilty of incest. These severe penalties for adultery were very much relaxed and softened by later smrti writers as is shown in H. of Dh. vol. II. pp. 571-573. A man who made a breach in the embankment of a lake or tank ( and thereby caused it to become dry ) may be sentenc ed to death by drowning (Manu IX. 279 ) or a woman who was extremely wicked (such as one who killed her own child in the womb ) or who murdered a man or who destroyed the embankments of a tank may have a stone tied round her neck and be drowned, provided she be not pregnant at the time of the sentence (Yaj. II. 278). Yāj. IL 279 (=Matsyapurana 227. 200 ) prescribes death by being gored by the horns of bulls (after the nose, lips, ears and hands are cut off) for a woman who is guilty of poisoning (the food or drink of another) or who is guilty of incendiarism or who kills her husband, elders

or her own child (provided she is not pregnant) 642. Yāj. II. 282 provides death by being burnt with the fire of straw for those who set fire to growing crops, houses, forests, village, pastures and threshing floors or who approach the queen. Nār. (pāruşya, Verse 31) prescribes that one who strikes with a weapon the king, even though the latter be at fault, should be impaled and roasted in fire. These examples are enough to convey an idea of the crimes for which the sentence of death was provided in some of the ancient smptis. Manu VIII. 272, Nār. (pāruşya 24), Vişnu Dh. 8. V. 24 prescribe the pouring of boiling oil in the mouth and ears of a sūdra who through insolence tries to expound dharma to brahmaņas. Cutting off limbs as a punishment (particularly hands and feet or fingers ) was common in the case of thieves, pickpockets and cut-purses (Manu IX. 276-277, Nār., parisista verse 32, Yaj. II. 274). Excision of the tongue was the sentence when a sūdra abused a brāh mana or a kşatriya by falsely charging him with some grave sin (Ap. Dh. S. II. 10. 27. 14, Manu VIII. 270, Nārada, pāruşya 22), when a sudra loudly repeated the Veda along with twice-born persons (Gaut. XII. 4), when a person abused the king ( Nār., pārusya 30 ), when a person repeatedly proclaimed what was disliked by the king or divulged the secret policy of the king ( Yaj. II. 302 ). Excision of the male organ was prescribed for a sūdra who sexually approached a woman of the three higher varnas (Gaut. XII. 2), for any one guilty of the rape of another's wife (Vrddha-Harita VII. 201 and also confiscation of all property ), for any one guilty of incest or intercourse with mother, mother's sister, paternal aunt, sister, 

: 642. The general rule was that women were not to be killed on any account. Vide H. of Dh. vol. II, pp. 575, 593–94. Certain offences were exceptions. Even as to them Vas, XXI, 10 and Yaj, I. 72 suggest another and very mild alternative viz. abandonment (tyāga), when a woman con. ceives from intercourse with a man of lower varna or when a woman was guilty of killing her busband or foetus, Acc. to the Mit. on Yāj. III. 268 the king appears to have had to undergo some expiation for ordering the death of a guilty woman. In the 18th century the famous judge of the Peshwa's court, Rāmsastri Prabhune, ordered a woman guilty of & brah maņa's murder to undergo only the expiation of circumambulating the holy shrine and bill of Tryambakesvara near Nasik ("Selections from Peshwa's Daftar', vol. 43 No. 156 pp. 121-122). Under sec, 382 of the Indian Cri. minal Procedure Code 'if a woman sentenced to death is found to be preg. Aant, the High Court shall order the execution of the sentence to be post poned and may, if it thiols fit, commute the sentence to transportation for life',

Various kinds of punishments 

403 

the wife of an uncle, friend or pupil, daughter, daughter-in-law, teacher's wife, a woman come for refuge, the queen, an ascetio woman, a wot-nurse and any chaste woman or a woman of a higher varna (Nar., stripumnsayoga 73-75). The nose, the ears and the hands were out off in the case of an offender guilty of selling false gold or forbidden flesh such as that of a dog ( Yāj. II. 297 ). For branding, vide Gaut. XII. 44, Baud. Dh. S. I. 10. 19, Nār. (sāhasa 10), Manu XL 237 (=Matsya 227.16), Vişnu Dh. S. V.3-7. The Daņdaviveka (p. 47) states that branding was to be resorted to if the proper penance was not performed and if the offence was intentional. Yaj. II. 202 provides branding for a gambler using false dice and (II. 294) for persons of the three higher varnas having intercourse with a very low caste woman and Daksa VII. 33 prescribes it for an ascetic giving up his duties. The Rājatarangipi mentions ( VI. 108-112 ) that king Yašaskara (939-948 A. D.) of Kashmir branded on a brāhmaṇa's forehead the mark of dog's foot. Košavapandita in his Dandaniti-prakarana (p. 6) quotes the author of the Vaijayanti (Nanda-pandita) to the effect that the making of marks was to be effected with the juice of the marking nut in the case of brāhmaṇas and with a red-hot iron salākā in the case of others. In England about a hundred years ago branding for desertion from the army was practised. Manu VIII. 370 prescribes the shaving of the head as a punish ment for a woman who pollutes a maiden, Nār. (śāhasa 10) preg cribes it for a brāhmaṇa who is not sentenced to death on account of his caste, Sapkha-Likhita (g. by Aparārka p. 807) for one who abuses officers, brāhmaṇas and elders. Megasthenes ( Fragment XXVII. p. 72 ) notes ' If one is guilty of a very heinous offence the king orders his hair to be cropped, this being a punishment to the last degree infamous'. Imprisonment for life is prescrib ed by Vişnu V.71 for striking out both eyes of a man and by Sukra IV.1. 88 (for repeating an offence more than three times) For imprisonment with labour, vide Sukra IV. 1. 92 and 108-109. Flogging was prescribed 643 by Vishnu Dh. S. V. 105 for a woman. 

643. The punishment of whipping is allowed in England for several offences; vide Laws of England (ed. by Lord Hailsham, vol. IX, pp. 229-230). In India under the Prisons Act (IX of 1894) by section 46 whipping is allowod for certain prison offences and under the Whipping Act ( IV of 1909) whippiag is awarded for certain offences such as theft, house breaking, dacoity, rape and for juvenile offenders. In modern times many persons laterested in criminology and penology condemn most strongly the stentences of death and whipping.

The punishment of banishment was prescribed for brāhmaṇas guilty of the gravest offences meriting death sente noe (Gaut. XII. 44, Manu IX. 241, VIII. 380, Vişnu Dh. S. V. 3 and 8, Baud Dh, S. I. 10. 19, Yaj. II. 270 ). It was often associated with branding. Banishment is also prescribed by Yāj. I. 339 for officers taking bribes (and also confiscation of all wealth), for a perjured brahmana witness (Yāj. II. 81 ), for one who embezzles the money of a corporation or transgresses the conventions agreed upon by a guild or village &c ( Yāj. II. 187, Manu VIII. 219, Visņu Dh. S. V. 167-168 ), for playing with false dice (Yaj. II. 202 and Nār., dyütasamahyaya 6), for a brāhmana guilty of very heinous offences 644 (Santi 14. 116). Sukra (IV.1. 98-108 ) contains a long list of offenders that deserve to be sentenced to banishment. Confiscation of all property was the punishment for several offences such as the commissa ion of the mahāpātakas by persons other than brāhmaṇas, provided they committed them unintentionally (Manu IX. 242), for perjury, for taking bribes by sabhyas (Vişnu Dh. S. V. 179-180). Nār. (prakirpaka 10-11) provides a humane rule that even when the king orders the confiscation of all the property of an offender he should not deprive the offender of the tools of his trade or the tools of his craft, such as arms in the case of a soldier, materials of art in the case of artisans, ornaments of courtezans, musical instruments of musicians. Sankha-Likhita 645 quoted by V. R. p. 656 contain a similar provision. • Enhanced punishment was prescribed for committ ing an offence again. Vişnu Dh. 8. III. 93 holds that a king should never pardon or let off a man who is guilty of a second

offence (though a first offender may be let off with a mere admonition). Kaut. IV. 10 states that when a person is a first offender as to theft at a holy place or as a pickpocket or house breaking from the roof, his thumb and index finger may be cut off or he may be fined 54 paņas, for a second offence all fingers may be cut or a fine of 100 paņas may be levied; for a third offence the punishment is cutting of the right hand or a fine of 400 panas and for the fourth death in any way the king may direct. Manu IX. 277, Yāj. II. 274, Vişņu Dh. S. V. 136 contain a similar rule. Vide Ap. Dh. S. II. 10. 27. 11-13 for adultery. If several people conspire together and kill or injure a single man the punishment was to be double of what a single man committing the same offence would receive ( Kaut. III. 19, Yāj. II. 221, Vişnu Dh. S. V. 73). As indicative of the superstitions of ancient (and even modern) times punishment for witchcraft may be mentioned. Kaut. IV. 4 prescribes 616 the employment of spies to find out those who profess to use charms for securing illicit love and banish them and adds that persons who are engag ed in witchcraft to injure others may be similarly dealt with. In the times of the Peshwas wizards 647 and raisers of ghosts appear to have been frequent and were severely dealt with by the peo ple themselves by being put to death, but the State generally confiscated the property or cut off the alleged wizard's finger. Up to the beginning of the 18th century even in England wretched old women were frequently convicted as witches and hanged 618

Manu IX. 290 (=Matsya 227. 183) prescribes the very mild punishment of the fine of 200 paņas for all incantations intended to destroy life, for magic rites and various kinds of raising ghosts and gobling. Medhātithi and Kullūka say that if the magio rites are successful the punishment would be that for murder. Bp. (S. B. E. vol. 33 p. 361 verse 16 ) provides banish ment for those who practise incantations with roots. 

Kauț. in II. 5 prescribes 649 that a jail should be constructed in the capital provided with separate accommodation for men and women kept apart and well guarded at the entrances. He further provides 650 that among the duties of the nāgaraka is to let out of the jail on the day of the festival of the birth con stellation of the king and on the full moon day (of every month) such persons as are young, very old, suffering from diseases and helpless, or those who are charitably, disposed may pay the fines or others bind themselves by an agreement to pay in cash the fines for the offences for which the prisoners aro jailed (and then the prisoners may be released). The persons jailed may be set free on their working every day or once in five days or by undergoing corporal punishment (whipping &o.), paying fines in cash. Prisoners may be released from jail (as a favour) on the conquest of fresh territory or on the coronation of the Crown Prince or on the birth of a son to the king. In the Delhi Topra Pillar Edict No. IV (Corpus I. I vol." I. p. 123 and E. I. vol. II, pp. 253-54) Emperor Asoka promulgates that he gives three days' respite to prisoners on whom judgment has been passed and who have been condemned to death and in the 5th Pillar Edict of Delhi Topra (Corpus II vol. I. p. 126-128 and E. I. vol. II. pp. 258,259 ) he says that he let off prisoners 25 times in 26 years ( which is in conformity with Kauțiya's dictum cited above). In the first separate Ediots at Dhauli Asoka addresses his officers of justice in the capital (Nagaravyāvahārikāh) that they should so act that even a single person should not unnecessarily suffer imprisonment or pain. In spite of this if we are to believe Yuan Chwang, Asoka in his early career was most cruel and had constructed a jail

that was called Hell-prison of Asoka (vide Watters, vol. II. pp. 88-90). Manu IX. 288 requires that all jails should be so built as to abut on the royal road where the offenders suffering pain and in bad condition would be seen by all (in order to deter others from committing offences ). The Silappadikāram, one of the earliest works in Tamil, mentiong the release of prisoners on the king's birthday and at the founding of a temple (pp. 38-39 of Mr. Dikshitar's translation). Kalidasa in the Malavikāgnimitra 651 (Act IV) makes the Vidūşaka report to the king, 'the astrologers think that, as the constellation on which Your Majesty was born is in evil aspect now, let all prisoners be released'. Kalidasa ( in Raghu 17.19 ) alludes to the release of prisoners and the commutation of death sentences at the time of the coronation of king Atithi. The Bṛhat-Samhita ( 47.81 ) states that when the king takes the Puşyasnūna (ceremonial bath on the day on which the moon is in conjunc. tion with the Puşya constellation in the month of Pausa or every month ) he may order release except as to those prisoners who were convicted for offences connected with his own person or with the harem, 652 In the Mșcchakatika (Act X) also various occasions for the release of prisoners are mentioned by the executioner. The Harşacarita 653 (IL 2nd para ) refers to the Usage of releasing prisoners at the time of a coronation and on the birth of Harşa (IV. ). The prisoners are described in the latter passage as having long beards and as darkened by the accumulation of dirt on their bodies. 

Manu IX. 243 enjoins upon the king not to appropriate to himself the property of a man guilty of the mahāpātakas (by way of fine or confiscation) and warns that if he takes it out of greed he is tainted by the guilt of the offender. Manu (IX. 244-45 ) recommends that such fine may be cast into water as an offering to Varuna ( the Lord of waters ) who wields sceptre even over kings or may be bestowed on learned and virtuous

brāhmaṇas, that are lords of the whole world. Manu (IX. 246–247 ) further states that in the country where the king avoids taking the property of very wicked sinners men become long-lived, crops spring up, there is no infant mortality &c. 

Generally no one was allowed to take the law into his own hands except as to recovery of debts ( which will be discussed below). But Nār. (pārusya 654 11-14) contains the following remarkable passage: 'If a svapāka, a meda, a candāla, one devoid of a limb, one gaining livelihood by killing animals, an elephant driver, vrūtya (i. e. deprived of caste for non performance of upanayana), a slave, one who disregards his elders or spiritual teacher if these should transgress the limits they must observe towards their superiors, they should be punish ed then and there by the person offended and the person so doing is not regarded as committing an offence (equal to theft). Should any such low person insult another (who is his superior ) that man himself shall punish him and the king has nothing to do with the punishment. These people are like the refuse ( dregs) of humanity and their property also is impure. The king is entitled to inflict bodily punishment (whipping ), but he should not inflict fines on them'. The Mit, on Yāj. II. 270 quotes a text of Vṛddha-Manu of similar import and explains that the words 'the king should avoid taking fines' refer to cases of grave offences 655 

Something must be said about the law of Limitation. In the smrtis and digests rules of Limitation play very little part for several reasons. As on spiritual grounds, which will be set out under the title of rņādāna, not only the debtor, but also his sons, grandsons and great-grandsons were liable to pay a debt (Mit. on Yāj. II. 50 ), there was no scope at all for prescribing any period of limitation so far as recovery of debts was concerned. Unpaid purchase money was treated as a debt. In other matters also the smrtis and dharmaśāstras, under the influence of religious and other-worldly considerations always lean against

allowing mere lapse of time to prevent a man from asserting his just rights. But rarely there were writers who were more secular and laid down periods of limitation. For example, Kauņdinya 656 ( quoted in V. Matsaka p. 341 ) holds that a debt not claimed for ten years cannot be recovered except when the creditor was a minor or very old or was a woman or was suffer ing from disease or there was confusion due to invasion or (the oreditor or debtor ) had left the country. Some important rules on the law of Limitation are set out here in one place : 

1. Manu VIII. 148, Yaj. II. 24, Gaut. XII. 35, Vas. 16. 17, 

Nār. IV. 79 and others state that enjoyment of immovable property in the presence of the real owner without protest from him causes logs of ownership and ten years' enjoyment of movables under similar circumstances leads to the same result. There are various views on the subject which have already been 

indicated above ( on pp. 322-325 ). 2. An exception to the above rule is stated to be that no 

limitation applies to pledges. boundaries, deposits, and to the property of minors, idiots, the State, women and brāhmaṇas learned in the Vedas. Vide Gaut. XII. 35-36, Vas. 16. 18, Manu VIII. 149, Yāj. II. 25, Nār. 

IV. 81, Br. (S. B. E. vol. 33 p. 312 verse 21 ). 3. As the rules about deposit are extended by Nār. 

(upanidhi verse 14) to articles borrowed or given to artisans for being worked, and to anvāhita, nyāsa and pratinyāsa, in the case of these also there would be ordinarily no bar of limitation. Vide Manu VIII. 145-146, Yāj. II. 58, Vişpu Dh. S. VI. 7-8. Here also there are dicta to the contrary. Marici (q. in Sm. C. II. p. 69 quoted above on p. 326 ) says that cows, beasts of burden, ornaments and the like borrowed in a friend. ly way would have to be returned (at the latest) in four or five years, otherwise they are lost. Aco. to Vyāsa 657 this rule would not apply to what is lent to

It appears that a period of twenty years was prescrib ed for avoiding a document on the ground of patent defects by one who had seen it and was affected by it. Vide Kāt. 298-300.

A careful perusal will convince any unbiassed reader that the Dharma sāstras evolved during the course of centuries an indigenous system of judicial procedure of a high order. Nārada, Brhas pati and Katyāyana répresent the high water mark of ancient Indian adjective law. These writers flourished before 600 A, D. and the first two of them are probably older by several centu ries than that date. They present an orderly system providing for the appointment and duties of judges, proper pleadings, the law of evidence and limitation, decrees and their execution, crimes and punishments. This system compares most favour ably with any system of judicial procedure prevalent anywhere in the West up to the 18th century A. D.

CHAPTER XVI. 

CONTRACTS 

There are only three titles of law, viz, recovery of debts, the relation of husband and wife (stripunsayoga) and partition of wealth (dāyabhāga) that are of importance to modern Hindus, since to a very large extent they are oven now governed in these matters by the ancient Hindu Law as interpreted by the commentators. These three topics therefore have to be described in detail while other titles will not and cannot be allowed to occupy much space. In almost all smrtis and digests of Hindu Law rņādāna (recovery of debts) is treated of first. Therefore here also that subject will be taken up first. A good deal of the matter falling under the title of the relation of husband and wife has already been dealt with in the 2nd volume of the History of Dharmaśāstra pp. 427-636. The topic of dāyubhāga will be dealt with last of all, the other topics being taken up in the same order as in Manu. Many of the vyavahūrapadas are concerned with the law of contracts in various aspects, viz. the contract of debt, of pledge or mortgage, of bailments, of sale, of partnership, of hire and service. 

Our writers do not set out with an analysis of the con ception of contract in general. They had before them the ancient 18 titles of law, many of which related to various kinds of contracts and therefore they take up one title after another, in the order contained in Manu or in Nārada ( as the Sm, C. II. p. 206 expressly says). But it is not to be supposed that they did not evolve certain general principles about contracts. They do say a good deal about the competence of persons to enter into contracts, about fraud vitiating all contracts, about damages for breach of contract &q. Sim ilarly the dharma sāstras do not lay down a general Code of rules applicable to all transfers of' immovable property, nor do they treat of transfers by way of sale, mortgage or gift in separate sections. What they have to say on these transfers is tācked on to some vyavahārapada e. 8. they speak about sales and exchanges of land under asvāmi-vikraya and simāvivada, about gifts under dattāpradānika and about mortgages under pnādana. As this work has to represent what the ancient law was like the same412

| voi. 

arrangement has been followed here. Similarly the law of crimes is not to be found in one place. It is scattered under different titles of law such as vākpāruøya, dapdapārusya, sāhasa, strisangrahaņa and steya; nor is there a complete analysis of intention or motive or of the right of private defence, although all these subjects are briefly dealt with in the smptis in different places. 

A great deal has been said by ancient writers about what. persons are competent to enter into transactions ( vyavahāra ) The Arthasastra (in III. 1 ) 661 has a lengthy disquisition on it Briefly, it holds that dependent persons, minors, extremely old people, those charged with grave sins, sannyāsins, persons who are devoid of a limb and those who are addicted to vices (like drinking and whoring) are incompetent and agreements made with such people are invalid. Among dependent people Kautilya mentiong a son whon the father is alive (and manages the affairs), a father when he has a son (who manages the family affairs ), a brother who has left the family, a younger brother whoge share has not been separated, a woman whose husband or son is alive, a slave or a hired servant. He states that these may enter into binding agreements if those on whom they are dependent authorize them to do so. He further says that contracts made by persons that are at the time of making them intoxicated or are under the influence of wrath or are distressed or are of unsound mind or under duregs (imprisoned or confined ) are invalid. Yāj. (II. 31-32) concisely puts down the same propositions by saying that all transactions brought about by force or fraud should be declared (by the king ) to be un enforceable, so also those entered into by women or the other persong specified above or entered into at night, or in the interior of the house or outside the town or village ( in a forest &c.) or with one's enemy or by persons unconnected with or unauthorized by the persons who are to be bound by them. 662 Manu (VIII. 165 and 168 ) also declares that all transactions (such as sale, mortgage, gift) brought about by force or fraud are

null and void. Nār. IV, 26-42 treat this subject 663 exhaus, tively. Some of Narada's dicta are interesting. He says: ' in this world three are independent viz. the king, the Vedic teacher and the head of the house in his own house (32). Wives, sons and slaves are not independent; the head of the house has independent power as to what belongs to him by inheritance (34).' Kāt. (497) also prescribes that one should not give a loan to women, minors or slaves. When the texts say that women are incompetent to make contracts, what is meant is that they cannot make contracts binding on their husbands or family or against the family property. Women are not inherently in competent to deal with their own separate property except that the husband has some control ( these matters will be discussed at length later on under stridhana). Another proposition laid down by Yāj. II 23, Nār. IV. 97, Kāt. (517) and others 664 is that in all transactions relating to a debt or any other title of law the last act is the deciding factor ; but in the cases of gift, pledge or purchase each prior transaction (of gift &c. ) is of superior efficacy to the succeeding one. 665 

After the establishment of British rule in India during about 150 years numerous publications dealing with Hindu customs and usages and the Hindu law of debts, contracts, adoption, family rights, partition and inheritance have been published. It is impossible to give an exhaustive list of these nor is it neces sary to do so. Most of them have now only an academic or historic interest. But a few of thon must be mentioned for their worth, for purposes of study and for a knowledge of the. modern Hindu, Law as administered by the British Indian courts 

They are : Bannerjee's 'Hindu Law of Marriage and stridhan'

The idea of the liability to pay off one's debts was developed in India in the most ancient times. In Rg. VIII. 47. 17666 the poet exclaims' Let us drive away the evil effects of bad dreams as we pay off debts'. In Rg. X, 34, 10 ( the gambler's lament) it is stated that the gambler, because he owes a ( gambling ) debt, is afraid and approaches the houses of others at night, desiring wealth '. 667 This indicates that a debtor was afraid of being detained by his creditor in those days. Rg. VIII. 66. 10 indicates that money-lenders made a stipulation to receive double of what they lent, 'Indra strikes by his power all panis who make representations of taking double '. 668 The Ait.

world ( of pitss ) and the third world (the world of gods ). 670 The Tai. S. (III. 3. 8. 1-2 ) uses the very word 'kusida ', which occurs 671 in the Dharmasūtras and smrtis ( for money-lending) when it says, 'O Agnil whatever debt has not been paid back by me, the tribute that I owe to Yama, here do I make return of it; may I be freed from that debt 1. The Sat. Br. XIII. 4.3.11 associates kusidin with black magic in the Pāriplava. The Nirukta (VI. 32 ) while commenting on Rg. III. 53, 14 explains the word Pramaganda' occurring therein as 'one who is born of a family that is extremely usurious ', 672 Pāṇini employs the technical word ' uttamarpa'(creditor ) in his sūtra 'dhārer-uttamarpah' (I. 4. 35), he speaks of "adhamarnya' (the position of a debtor) in II. 3. 70 and the word "pratibhữ' occurs in Papini II. 3. 39, the word 'vrddhi' (interest) in V. 1. 47. Pāpini (IV. 4.31) derives the words 'kusidika' and ' kusidikin.' It is noteworthy that Pāṇini does not derive or mention the word vārdhuşika, which is employed by oven Ap. Dh. S, and Baud. Dh. S. and which is derived by Katyāyana ( the grammarian) in Vārtika 3 on Pāṇini IV. 4. 30, in which Papini refers to such words as 'dvaiguņika' or 'traiguņika'which were applied to people that carried on the condemned methods of money-lending viz. extorting twofold or threefold of the money lent ( the sūtra is 'prayacchati garhyam'). Brahmanaspati is spoken of as 'one who recovers a debt (rņam-ādadih) in Rg. II. 24. 13 and the Adityas as those who, themselves being the observers of rta (the universal Law of Right), collect 673 debts' (Rg. II. 27. 4). In Rg. VIII. 32. 16 it is said that those priests who extract (and offer ) Soma juice do not indeed owo a dent (to the gods ). Divodāsa is said in Rg. VI. 61. 1 to have been the gift of Sarasvati to Vadhyrasva as a son to pay off debts ( macyutam ) 674. These passages certainly establish that in the remote ages of the

Rgveda it was a firm belief that men were under obligations to gods and pitrs, which could be fulfilled only by worship (yana ) and by the birth of a son. These passages oontain the germ of the dootrine of the three religious and spiritual debts that a man owed to gods, Manes ( pitys ) and sages, which he paid off by sacrifices, by the birth of a son and by vedio study ( vide Tai. S. VL. 3.10.5, Sat. Br. 1 7.2.11 and Alt. Br. 33. 1 quoted in H, of Dh, vol. II. pp.270, 560 notes 621 and 130% and above n. 669). Gradually further universal obligations came to be added to this theory of spiritual debts. The Adiparva (120. 17-20 ) holds that men owe four debts, viz the three vedic ones and the fourth to humanity in general ( which is paid back by goodness to all) and Anušāsana 37. 17 raises them to five (adding brahmapas and guests to the well-known three ) 675. It appears to me that this theory of spiritual debts being already in the air, the same sanctity came gradually to be transferred to one's promises to repay monetary debts and carry out other secular engagements. The word rna had been applied both to spiritual and secular debts. It is on account of this that the son was not only desir ed for repaying the spiritual debt owed to one's ancestors, but he was also expected to free his father (if the father could not himself repay the monetary debt ) from the liability he incurred to his creditor. Nar. IV. 5-9 puts this clearly and most emphatically: "fathers desire to have song for their own benefit thinking in their heart he will release me from liability to creditors and debtors' (or probably 'from high or low debts' i. e. spiritual and earthly debts ). Three deceased ( ancestors ) must be honoured (by a man) and he must subsist on three ( descendants) that come after him. These ( the first three ) series of ancestors rely (for repayment) of their twofold debts ( spiritual and secular) on the fourth in descent. If a man fails to pay on demand a debt or promised gift, that sum (by the addition of interest) goes on growing till it amounts to a hundred crores and when a hundred orores are reached he is born again and again in the house of his creditor as a slave in order to repay the debt (by his labour).

without discharging his debts, the whole merit due to his austerities and the perpetual tending of fire belongs to his creditors". 676 Kat. (551, 591 ) expresses the same idea but adds that a debtor who has not repaid money borrowed may be born as a slave, & servant, a woman or a beast in the house of his creditor. It was this belief that led to the doctrine of the pious obligation of the son to pay off his father's debts even if he received no property from the father, 677 

Nārada IV. 98 defines "kusida' in a rather obscure verse as 'the receiving of money paid in consequence of the original ( amount advanced) and the profit ( agreed to be paid ) thereon and those are called kusidin who maintain themselves by this occupation'. Bphaspati ( S. B. E. 33 p. 320 verse 2) derives 678 kusida as 'that is called kusida, which is taken fourfold or ( even) eightfold without any qualm (by a person) from a wretched man who is sinking ( or distressed)'. Nār. IV. 110 defines vārdhuşa as the interest (in kind) on grain, 678a but Ap. Dh. S. I. 6. 18. 22 and Baud. Dh. S. employ the word 

vārdhuşika' and Ap. Dh. S. I. 9. 27. 10 has a verse in which the word urddhi occurs. Vas. (II. 41-42=Baud. Dh. 8. 1.5.93-94) quotes

two verses :' a vārdhusika (asurer) is one who taking cheap grain lends it on condition of receiving a quantity of grain of high price and is condemned among the brahmavādins ( students of the veda). Brahmaņa murder and usury were weighed in a balance; the murderer of a brābmana rose to the top while the usurer trombled'. Here usury of the type of the one described in Vas. II. 41 (and not all lending of money at interest) is condemned as a great sin, Gaut. XII. 26, Vas. II. 50, Kaut. III. 11, Manu VIII. 140-141 and others declare it righteous (dharmyā) moneylending when an 80th part is stipulated as the interest per month. 679 

Megasthenes (fragment XXVII B p.72) states: ' The Indiang neither put out money at usury nor know how to borrow;' but he is under soine misapprehension, for he again says (p. 73 ) 'one who is unable to recover a loan or deposit has no remedy at law. All the creditor can do is to blame himself for trusting a rogue'. 

Nār. IV. 1. states that the principal topics under the title of rņādāna are seven: what debts must be paid and what not; by whom, where and in what manner ( they are to be paid ); and the rules about advancing the loan and receiving it back. The first five of these relate to the debtor and the last two to the creditor. Bphaspati (S. B. E. 33 p. 320 v. 4) says that interest (výddhi) is described to be of four kinds by some, of five kinds by others and of six kinds by still others. Nār, (IV. 102-104) names four kinds and defines them, viz. kārita (interest that is stipulated by the debtor himself ), kālikā (interest accruing and payable every month), kāyikā (interest of a pana or quarter pana to be paid every day without the principal being liable to be reduced, whatever interest may have been recovered), rakravrddhi ( interest on interest called compound interest). Manu VIII. 153 mentions these four and commentators thereon give varying interpretations. Bșhaspati (S. B. E, 33 p. 321 verse 6 ) and Vyāsa ( g, by Sm. C. II. p. 154) define kūyikā as interest received from the body i. e. milk received from a cow pledged or the work put in by a slave or by a bull pledged. Br. (S. B. E. vol. 33 p. 321 verses 7-8)

adds two more varieties viz. dikhavṛddhi 680 (hair-like interest i. e. interest payable every day and so growing every day, just as the top-knot on one's head grows every day ) and bhogalabha (profit by enjoyment i. e, making use of a house or taking the produce of a field in lieu of Interest in the case of a mortgage ), Gaut. (XII. 31-32 ) mentions the six, but instead of bhogalābha he uses the word ' adhibhoga', which is defined by Kat. (501) as a transaction in which the completo enjoyment of the thing pledged or mortgaged is to be the interest. Kat. (498-500) defines karita, sikhavrddhi and bhogalabha. 

Br. (S. B. E 33 D. 319 yerse 1) stateg 681 that the creditor should always advance a loan after taking an adequate pledge or a deposit (with a mutual friend) or a reliable surety and after committing the transaction to writing or making the loan in the presence of witnesses. The interest may be either stipu lated (krta) at the time of the loan or not stipulated (alerta), as indicated in Visnu VI. 4. Yaj. II. 38 and Visnu Dh. S. VI. 3 state the general rule that debtors of all castes may pay to creditors of all castes the interest settled by mutual agreement and the rate of interest stipulated may be with reference to an

The wordsadhi and bandha are treated as synonyms by the Amarakosa and by Br. (S.B. E. vol. 33 p. 323 verse 17 ) himself.

Proper rates of interest

that double the interest stated above may be taken when there is nothing pledged to secure the debt. Yāj. and Vyāsa provide that this rate is the proper one when some thing is pledged or mortgaged by way of security. Yāj. II. 37, Manu VII. 14% (*Nār. IV. 100), Vişnu Dh. S. VI. 2 provide an option that two, three, four or five per cent per month may be charged as inte rest in the order of the varnas 684 (i, e. 2 per cent per month for a brāhmaṇa debtor and so on). Yaj. II. 37 allows these rates only if there is nothing pledged by way of security. Vyāga 685 (in Par. M. III. p. 221) provided that the monthly rate of inte rest was ofth of the principal lent when a pledge or mortgage was given as against the loan, oth when only a surety was offered and two per cent per month when money was lent on personal security. The Anusaganaparva 117.20 condemns to Hell those who take exorbitant interest. Kaut. prescribed ( as stated in n. 688 ) fines for taking heavier interest than that allowed by him. Kat. (498) provides that if a debtor himself stipulates a higher rate of interest than is allowed by the śāstra in times of difficulty (in order to induce the creditor to part with his money ) that stipulated interest must be paid but a rate of interest imposed by the creditor otherwise ( by force &c.) should not be enforced by the Court. 686 It is probable that these rates are specified because of the economic conditions of those times which proved too much even for the ancient sages or different mercantile usages about interest prevailed in different countries at different times, as expressly stated by Nār. IV. 105-106 that 687 these high rates (including eight per cent per month ) had to be paid according to the law merchant in different countries. Manu VIII. 141 ( =Nār. IV. 100 ) holds that to take two per cent per month (on unsecured debts ) is not improper. In medieval times also the rate of interest was rather high e. g. interest at 25 per cent is said to have been

charged on a deposit of six gadyaras kept with the mahajanas of Sivapura ( vide Yewur Ing. in E. I. XII. p. 273). Yaj. II. 38 provides that those debtors who carry on trade by traversing dense forests and those who are sea-faring traders should respectively pay 10 per cent and 20 per cent per month and tbe Mit. adds that these exorbitant rates are allowed because of the great danger of the logs of even the principal as the debtors may perish by ship-wreck or from the attacks of robbers and wild beasts. Manu VIII. 157 leaves the rate of interest in the case of seafaring merchants to those who are clover in these matters and who know the proper time and place. Kaut. (III. 11 ) states 688 that the prescribed (dharmya) rate of interest is 14 paņu per cent per month, but in transactions (or in commercial usage ) it is five panas per cent per month ( as the highest, it appears ), that those who traverse forests and those who carry on maritime trade should pay respectively ten and twenty per cent per month, that those who exceed or induce creditors to exceed these rates should be punished with the first amercement, that each of the witnesses to such usurious transact ions should be punished with half of the above fine. 

Other ruleg laid down in the smrtis relate to the maximum that can be recovered by a creditor from a debtor at one time. All are agreed that the creditor cannot recover at one time from the debtor for principal and interest more than double of the money lont. Vide Kaug. (III. 11), Manu VIII. 151, Gaut. XII. 28, Yāj. II. 39, Vişnu Dh. VI. 11, Nār. IV, 107, Kāt. (509). This is called the rule of draigunya 689 in the smrtis and of dāndupat in modern times. It will be explained in detall a little below. As regards the interest in kind on articles lent there is some difference of opinion, which need not be gone into in great detail. Manu VIII, 151 and Gaut. XII. 33 state that on loans of grain, fruits, wool and beasts of burden, and products like ghee and milk had from cattle the total recoverable cannot exceed in any case five times of what is lent. Yaj. II. 39 states

that in the case of cattle and female slaves wbon loaned their progeny is the profit, in the case of liquids (like oil and ghee) when loaned the maximum recoverable is eightfold and in the case of clothes and grain it is respectively four and three times. Vas. II. 44-47 says the maximum recoverable at one time in the case of grain, flowers, roots, fruits and fluids (like oil) is three-fold and eight-fold in the case of things that can be weighed. Vide Vişnu Dh. $. VI. 12-15. Visnu VI 17 (anuktūnām dviguņā) provides that where no special rule is laid down the maximum recoverable is to be only double of what is lent. Kāt. (570-572) states 690 that the maximum recoverable in the case of precious stones, pearls, corals, gold, silver, fruits, silk, wool is double of what is loaned; of oils, liquors, ghee, raw-sugar and salt and land eight-fold, of baser metals five-fold. Vide Bf. (S. B. E. vol. 33 p. 322 verses 13-16 ) and V. Nirnaya p. 229 ( quoting Bharadvāja) for similar provisions. 

The rule of what is called dāmdupu in modern times express od laconically by Manu VUL 151 and Gaut. XII. 28 is this that 'the amount of principal and interest recoverable at one time in a lump sum cannot be more than double of the money lent'. As a debt was recoverable not only from a man himself but also from his three descendants and as therefore there was practi cally no period of limitation for bringing a suit for money lent, creditors had great temptations to allow interest to go on increasing. Therefore the sages who condemned the profession of usury and particularly waiting long for the increase of interest 691 laid down that whatever the length of time during which the principal was at interest and whatever the rate of interest might have been, the creditor could recover by suit in a lump sum only double of the money lent.

cheok on the creditors' rapaoity. Several propositions are laid down in the Mit., 69 the Vyavabāramayukha and other digests that graft exceptions on the general rule, and that flow from the interpretation of Manu VIII, 151 in both readings. The first modification is that if interest is received every day, month or year and is not claimed in a lump sum at one time then the total interest received by a creditor may be even several times more than the principal lent. Br. provides (S. B. E, vol. 33 p. 321 verse 11 ) that every day interest or bodily interest and bhogalābha may be taken by the creditor ( irrespective of the question of dvaigunya) as long as the principal is not paid 6%, (2) Further, if after the interest has accumulated for some time, there is a fresh agreement with the same debtor whereby the sum lent together with interest due is taken as the principal and interest is agreed to be paid on the amount so arrived at, then the total recoverable after this fresh agreement may exceed double the original sum lent. Manu (VIII, 154-155 ) and Br. (8. B. E. vol. 33 p. 331 verse 60 ) allow such a fresh agreement. But if the debtor does not make a fresh agreement then the rule of dāndupat would apply. (3) If after the sum due to the creditor has become double of the principal lent, the creditor accepts another man as the debtor ( who takes the liability on himself), then the creditor may recover from the substituted debtor after the lapse of years an amount which may be more than double of the sum originally lent. (4) If the debtor pays a part of the principal or if the creditor makes a concession (called 

reka' in the Mit. on Yāj. II. 39 ) and reduces the total recover able or if the debtor receives an additional amount of money ( called 'seku' in the Mit.) and it is added to the original amount borrowed and a fresh agreement is made between the parties to put the whole to interest, then the rule of dāmdupat would not apply.

Rule of dāmdupat 

425 

The rule of damdupat has been acted upon by the courts in India in modern times 64. Though under the Transfer of property Act before its amendment in 1929 there was a conflict of decisions, since 1929 it is settled that the rule of damdupat does not apply to mortgages governed by the Transfer of Property Act. But the rule is so reasonable and humane that the Deccan Agriculturists' Relief Act (XVII of 1879 ) has made (by sec. 13) the rule of dāmdupat applicable to all agriculturists as defined by the Act, whether Hindus or non-Hindus; and the Bombay Agricultural Debtors Relief Act (of 1939), sec. 42, the Madras Debt Conciliation Act (XI of 1936, sec, 16 ) do the same. 

A loan has to be returned on demand if no time is fixed for repayment or on the expiry of the time ( if one has been fixed by the parties ) or when interest ceases on account of becoming equal to the principal ( Bộ. in 8. B. E. vol. 33 p. 328 verse 47 ) Interest stops when on the debtor offering to pay the loan the creditor refuses to accept it and the debtor deposits the money in the hands of a third person (Gaut. XII. 30, Yāj. II. 44). With Yāj. II. 44 section 84 of the Transfer of Property Act (IV. of 1882 ) may be compared. Vas. II. 49 states the remarkable rule that interest stops the moment the king dies and begins to run only after the coronation of the successor. 695 Nār. II. 39 

694. Vide Balkrishna v. Gopal I. L, R. 1 Bom. 73 (where it was held that the rule of dāmdupat should not be extended to apply to the amount recoverable in execution of the decree of a civil court), Nanchand v. Bapusaheb 1, L. R. 3 Bom. 131 (held that the rule of dāndupat does not apply when the defendant is a non-Hindu ), Gopal v. Gangaram I. L, R, 20 Bom. 721 F, B. (the rule is excluded from mortgages the terms of which necessitate the existence of an account between the mortgagor and the mort gagee in possession about the rents and profits ), Sundarabai v. Jayawant 1 Bom. LR, 551, 555 (rule applies between all Hindu debtors and creditors both in respect of simple as well as mortgage debts), Khimji v. Chunilal 21 Bom. L. R. 419 (by agreement interest which does not exceed the principal may be capitalized ). It is interesting to find that in ancient Egypt the legal maximum rate of interest was thirty per cent and it was forbidden to allow interest to increase beyond the double of the principal. Vide Wilkinson's * Maoners and Customs of the ancient Egyptians' (First Series). 1842, vol. II p. 50. Usury was condemned in ancient Egypt, among the Jews (vide Psalm XV. 5, Ezek. XVIII. 8 and 17, Lev. XXV. 36-37) and by the ancient smrtis (as more heinous than even the murder of a brāhmaṇa, H. of Dh. vol. II. p. 124 a. 269).

(S. B.E. vol. 33 p. 33) provides that no interest runs on the price of commodities, on wages, on a deposit, on a fine, on what has been idly promised ( to þards and the like) and on the stake won in gambling, unless there is a special or express agreement to pay interest. 696 Kāt. ( 508 ) has a similar verse, 697 but adds hides, crops, liquor, bride-price and suretyship debts to some of those mentioned by Nar. Kaut. (III. 11) provides that no interest runs where the debtor is a person engaged in a Vedic sacrifice of long duration, or is suffering from a disease or is staying at his teacher's house ( gurukula) for study or is a minor or is a man without any substance. As regards some cases where originally a thing is lent to a person out of friendship or because he asked a loan of it, Nar. (IV. 108) and Kat, (502-505) lay down certain rules which are quoted in the Mit. ( on Yāj. II. 38 ) and other works. Nār. (IV. 108 ) prescribes 698 that no interest ever attaches to things loaned through friendship, unless there is an express stipulation to that effect; but even in the absence of a stipulation interest starts running after the expiry of six months. Nar. IV. 109 and Kat. (505) both lay down that a loan (of money or an article) made through friend ship cannot begin to earn interest as long as no demand is made for its return. If the debtor refuses to return it after it is demanded interest begins to run at the rate of five per cent. Kāt. (502-504 ) 699 lays down three propositions about yācitaka (a temporary loan of money or of an article): (1) When a person takes such a loan and goes to another country without

returning it, that loan begins to acquire interest after a year from the date of the loan ( though no demand be made ); (2) if a person after taking a loan goes to another 700 country without returning it even when pressed by the lender to return it that loan begins to acquire interest three months (after demand); (3) when the borrower of a thing does not return it even though he is pressed to return it, the king should make him pay interest from that day (i. e. day of demand ), though it was not agreed upon, though he remained in the country and though he be unwilling to pay interest. The Madanaratna says that in these cases where no interest is settled beforehand and where the texts do not specify the rate (as Kāt. 505-506 do viz. what is lent through friendship, a deposit, balance of interest, unpaid purchase money, if not returned on demand, begin to carry interest at five per cent per month ), the rate of interest would be the one stated by Yāj. II. 37 (viz. 1/80th per month ) and Visnu VI. 4. (akstāmapi vatsarātikramena yathāvihitam ), 

Adhi701 means pledge of a movable or mortgage of im movable property. Nār.

An ādhi is so called because the creditor is authorised to wield power over it or it is placed within his power (Nār. IV. 124 and Mit. on Yāj. II. 58)703. The

II. 38 and holds that these incidents are even now applicable to contracts of debts by Hindu debtors and that neither the Interest Act (XXXII of 1839) nor the ladian Contract Act affects the ancient Hindu Law. It should be noted that 31 Mad. 250 aad 53 Mad. 549 at p. 579 dissent from this view.

word adhi occurs in Ap. Dh. 8. I. 6. 18. 20704 (which includes among those who are unfit to be invited at a śrāddha 'one who subsists on adhi'). Gaut. XII. 29 also refers to adhi, Kaut. (IIL. 12 ) briefly deals with ādhi and after stating some rules extends the principles of upanidhi (deposit) and debt to it. Manu VIII. 165 employs the word 'adhamana' in the sense of' mortgage'. According to Br. 705 (S. B. E. vol. 33 p. 323 verse 17 ) an ādhi is of four kinds viz. of movable property, of immovable property, gopya (to be kept in custody of the pledgee only ), bhogya (to be enjoyed). Nār. IV, 124 first divides adbi into two sorts, viz. one that is to be redeemed within a certain time fixed (by agreement at the time of contracting the debt) or to be retained till the debt is paid off and Nār. IV. 125 again subdivides each of these two into gopya and bhogya. This latter division was known to Gaut. XII. 32 Manu VIII. 143, Yāj. II. 59, Kāt. (576). The subdivisions of adhi are made from several points of view viz. the nature of the property, the form of the pledge, the men tion or non-mention of a period and the evidence to establish it. The Mit. on Yaj. II. 58 explains 706 that the first kind of adhi mentioned in Nār. IV. 124 contains the conditions that the money will be repaid at a fixed time and that if the money be not so paid at the time fixed the thing pledged or mortgaged will belong to the creditor. Yāj. 'II. 58 sets out three provisions viz. (1) when a time is fixed for payment, the thing pledged or mortgaged is lost to the debtor if the time fixed is allowed to pass without there being any repayment ( whether it be an adhi that is to be merely kept or whether it is one to be enjoyed); (2) but if no time be fixed the thing given as security is not lost

to the debtor at all, when it is an adhi that is to be enjoyed; (3) if no time is fixed and the adhi is only to be kept (gopya) then it is lost to the debtor only if it is not redeemed even when the debt has grown to double of the principal by non-payment of the interest agreed upon. There is a period of fourteen days' grace after this, as stated by Bṛ. (8. B. E.707 vol. 33 p. 324, verses 27-28) that when the principal has been doubled or the stipulated period in the case of a pledge delivered for a certain time only has expired, the creditor becomes the owner of the pledge, after waiting for a fortnight during which the debtor may repay the debt and redeem his property. Gaut. XII. 29, Manu VIII. 143, Yāj. II. 58, Vişnu Dh. S. VI. 5 provide that an adhi which is mortgaged with the condition that the fruit or profits are to be enjoyed bears no interest nor can the creditor, even after keeping such an ādhi for a long time, make a gift of it or sell it. Medhātithi on Manu VII. 143 holds that a mort gagee with possession who is to enjoy the produce cannot, by virtue of the last quarter of Manu VIII. 143, make a sub-mortgage (called anvādhi). Kullūka on 708 the other hand says that it is common practice in all countries for a mortgagee to execute a sub-mortgage of land and the like and that Manu VIII. 143 does not forbid it. Prajāpati 709 (q. by Par. M. III. p. 242) defines a deed of sub-mortgage: 'if the creditor pledges to another the thing already pledged to him for the same amount (for which it was pledged to him ) he should pass a fresh deed of pledge (or mortgage ) and should hand over the former deed to his own creditor.' It appears that sub-mortgages came to be recognized rather late. Bharadvaja states that if a sub-mortgage be effected without the mortgagor's consent, the mortgagee would lose his money.

..The general rule was that an adhi (whether of movable or immovable property ) that was bhogya carried no interest but the profits were to be taken in lieu of interest (vide Kāt. 516 ) 710 and the debtor would in this case get back his property on paying the principal. Kaut. (III. 12 ) states 711 that immovable property mortgaged may be such that it can be enjoyed only by expending labour over it or without expending one's own labour the creditor may enjoy the fruits or income thereof. But as noted by Vyāga and Bharadvāja 712 the stipulation about a bhogya ādhi may be that the income from the property is to be taken as in payment of the whole interest and part of the principal. This latter is called sapratyaya-bhogyadhi and the other variety where the income is taken in lieu of interest only is called apratyaya-bhogyādhi. The Mit, on Yāj. II. 64 after citing a text of Bphaspati refers to these two varieties (though it does not use these terms) and adds that if the income is not sufficient to meet the interest wholly then the debtor may have to pay the principal and the unpaid part of the debt before redeem ing his property. The Mit. (on Yaj. II. 64 ) states that the appropriate name 'kşayādhi' is given by the people to what is called (above) as sapratyaya-bhogyādhi. Bharadvāja states that on taking an account ( where there is an agreement to apply the income towards interest and reduction of the principal) if the creditor has been overpaid he is to restore the overpaid amount to the debtor and that if a portion of the principal remains unpaid the debtor has to repay it. 

If a man first mortgaged his property and then sold it, the purchaser took it subject to the rights of the mortgagee (Vasistha quoted by Sm. C. II. p. 145). If a person executed a mortgage, a sale and a gift of the same thing on the same day, then the

donee would take one-third of the thing and the mortgagee and purchaser would share the remaining two-thirds in proportion to the money paid by each 713. If a person was liable to pay several debts, some secured by a pledge or mortgage and some taken on personal security, the latter were to be paid first and redemption of the mortgage was to be ordered afterwards, according to Bharadvāja (q. by Vy. Nir. p. 245 ). 

The restriction that more money should not be taken from the sub-mortgagee than what was advanced to the mortgagor was for the benefit of the latter. The Par, M. (III. p. 242) provides that a sub-mortgage can be made only when the amount due has risen to double the principal, but that if the owner consents a sub-mortgage may be made even before that con tingency arises. 

Kāt. (522) requires that an adhi becomes valid when such particulars as the boundaries of the field or house and the village ( in which it is situated) are specified 714 Kat::(518) further provides that a writing of pledge or sale or gift is superior to a similar transaction made in the presence of witnesses only. If the same field or other thing is mortgaged or pledged to two persons separately, Visnu Dh. S. V. 185 715 and Br. (S. B. E. 33 p. 326 verse 34 ) prescribe n6 that the one who got possession first (without force ) is entitled to preference. This shows that under ancient Hindu Law possession was nine points of law and that hypothecation without delivery of possession was known to Kāt. and other smrti writers, even if earlier smrtis did not recognise an hypothecation without possession. Yāj. II. 60 and Nār. IV, 139 emphatically assert that a pledge or mortgage becomes perfect or effective only if there

is enjoyment and not otherwise. This is to be taken along with Yaj. IL 23 and so the first in time shall prevail only if the first is accompanied with possession. If a sale or mortgage be made before witnesses to one man and in writing to another, the latter prevails over the former 717. If a debtor were to pledge or mortgage the same thing to another after pledging it to one and without redeeming the first debt, Vişnu Dh. 8. (V. 181-182) prescribed 718 the drastic measure of corporal punishment (whipping or imprisonment) if the land mortgaged was a gocurma or more in extent or a fine of 16 suvarnas if it was less. Kat. (517) in similar circumstances made the debtor liable to the fine imposed on a thief. Kat. (519-521 q. in Sm. C. II. pp. 144 145 and V. P. pp. 240-241 ) states that in a competition between a document of pledge which does not give particulars of the thing pledged or which refers to a thing not existing at the time and a document in which the thing pledged is described with partioulars or in which the thing existed at the time the deed was executed, the latter is entitled to preference; similarly the pledge of a thing specifically described is superior to a prior pledge of all the debtor's property mentioned in general terms. 

If an adhi deteriorates 719 in value (i. e, becomes inadequate to meet principal and interest) or if it be lost or destroyed though proper care be taken thereof by the creditor, then the debtor must either pledge another adequate thing (in substitu tion) or the debtor should return the amount due (Yaj. II. 60, Kat. 524). The Mit. on Yāj. II. 60 remarks that it follows from this that it is the duty of the pledgee to take proper care of the thing pledged. Br. ( S. B. E. 33 p. 323 verse 19 ) expressly says

that the pledge has to be kept carefully like a deposit, as other wise interest is forfeited in case of its being damaged. If a pledge which is to be kept only is enjoyed by the creditor, then the interest stops and if it deteriorates or is lost the creditor has to restore it to its former condition or substitute another of equal value; if a pledge to be enjoyed is lost or deteriorates by use then also the interest stops; and the creditor has to restore it, otherwise he will lose his principal (Yāj. II. 59 and the Mit. thereon, Nār. IV. 125, 127). If a pledge is lost without any fault or negligence of the creditor, but through fate (i. e. accidents like fire or flood) or the action of the king, the debtor has to furnish another pledge or to pay the amount due(Kāt. 523, Nār. IV.126, 130, Yaj. II.-59, Vispu Dh. S. VI. 6, Gaut. XII. 39, Br., S. B. E. 33 p. 323 verse 21). From the time of Gautama 720 (about 500 B. C.) onwards the rule about the care required of a pledgee, bailee, depositee was the same viz. that he is to take of another's property kept with him as much care as he would take of his own. Nār. (niksepa 14) and Yāj. II. 67 lay down the same rule for all kinds of bailments. Manu VIII. 189 ( =Nār., nikşepa, Verse 12) illustrates what is meant by accidental loss. 

The debtor cannot redeem the pledge or mortgage before the time fixed by mutual agreement, but by mutual agreement he can redeem even before (Bṛ. S. B. E. P. 325 verses 32-33). If the creditor does not allow redemption when the debtor has a right to redeem and is ready to do so, the creditor may be liable to be fined as a thief (Yāj. II. 62). Acc. to Kaut. (III, 12) the fine is 12 panas721. 

It has already been stated above (p.429) that in certain cases (i.e. when it is a gopya ādhi) the ownership is lost to the mortgagor (i. e, in the language of modern law there is a foreclosure), if the amount has risen to double of the money lent without payment (even after the period of grace) or if the period fixed has passed away without there being repayment (whether the

amount has risen to double of that lent or not, aoo. to Mit. on Yaj. II.58). But if at the time of contracting the debt the stipulation is to repay the sum lent with interest and there is no stipulation about loss of the ownership of the thing mortgaged (1. e. it is like a simple mortgage of modern times), then there is no loss of ownership. There is then only a power of sale in the mortgagee, So also in the case of a bhogyādhi the mortgagor or bis heirs can redeem the property at any time by paying the principal and there is no loss of ownership to the mortgagor. According to Yaj. II. 63 and Br. 722 (S. B. E. vol. 33 p. 325 verse 29) the creditor can sell in the presence of (the debtor's relatives) and witnesses the adhi, when the amount has grown to double of that lent or when the period fixed has passed, if the debtor has not redeemed and is absent or dead. After 

meeting his own dues the creditor has, as said by Kat. 529, to hand over the balance of the sale price to the king (i, e. pro bably to the court of the locality). Kaut.723 (III. 12) provides that if the debtor is present and the creditor is afraid of the loss of his money because it may exceed the market value of the ādhi he may sell it with the permission of the judges (dharmastha) or he may demand a surety for assurance. It appears from these passages that a sale through court and a right of private sale were both recognised in the case of mort gages in ancient India (as in modern times under sections 65 and 69 of the Transfer of Property Act). 

There were two other special kinds of adhi described in Yaj. II. 61 viz. caritrabandhaka 724 and satyankāra. The first

occurs either when the creditor being known to be very honest the debtor gives as security a property of very great value for a small debt or where a debtor being known to be very honest & property of very small value is accepted as security for a large debt. In such a case there is no forfeiture or foreclosure of the property in any case but the king (or judge ) should award only double the principal lent. Another meaning is that in a caritrabandhaka it is the merit (apūrva or punya) arising from bathing in the Ganges or from performance of agnihotra that is given as security (i. e. he will forfeit merit on non payment). In this case the creditor will receive double and there is no loss or forfeiture of adhi. A pledge made with satyankāra occurs when at the time of making a pledge the stipulation is 'I am liable to pay only double but there will be no loss of the thing pledged' or (a second meaning of) satyan kāra is that when an earnest (a ring or the like) is given at the time of a sale and the vendor breaks the promise he has to pay double of the earnest'. 

If the mortgagee is dead or absent abroad, and the debtor wants to redeem he may take back the ādhi after paying the amount due to the family i. e. to his sons and other agnatic relations or to his cognates and in the absence of these (if the creditor be a brāhmaṇa) to other brāhmaṇas (and if no brāh manas be available) he may cast the money into water ( Yāj. II. 62 and Nār. IV. 112-113). The Kausika-sūtra 725 ( 46. 36-40) contains provisions about casting the debt in the cemetery or where four roads meet if the creditor is dead and there are no heirs. The Sangraha says that it may be thrown into water with a palāśa leaf to the accompaniment of Tai. S. III. 3. 4. 1-% quoted above (n. 671). Another alternative is that the debtor may have a valuation of the ādhi made at the time when he wants to redeem (and the creditor is absent), and allow it to remain with the creditor but without interest (and redeem it at the valua tion when the creditor comes or secure the price from the creditor if the ādhi be afterwards lost or destroyed, acc. to Mit. on Yāj. II. 63). 

Pratibha. A pratibhū or lagnaka (Bp. quoted in n. 681 and Kāt. 530) means 'surety'. Pratibhavya (boing a surety) was known to Gautama (XII. 38) and pratibhū was known to Panini

( II. 3. 39). Suretyship requires the concurrence of three persons viz. the creditor, the borrower (called the principal debtor) and the person who agrees, for inspiring confidence in the creditor 72, to pay or indemnify if the principal debtor commits default. Manu VIII. 160 speaks of surety for appearance and for repay ment of debt. According to the purpose of the transaction a surety is of three kinds (Yāj. II. 53 =Vişņu Dh. S. VI. 41 and Nār. IV. 118) viz. for appearance, for payment and for honesty. The first undertakes to produce a person before a court and assures the court that the person concerned will not abscond from the country; the surety for payment agrees that in case the debtor does not pay the principal and interest, he will him self pay both; the surety for honesty assures the employer or other person with whom another man deals that the latter is an honest and good man, that he would not deceive and that re liance may be placed on him (vide Mit. on Yāj. II. 53 and Sm. C. II. p. 148 for these explanations). Br. (S. B. E. 727 vol. 33 p. 327 verses 39-40) speaks of four (including the three of Yāj. II. 53), his fourth being one who promises to deliver or restore the assets that are with the debtor (such as household furniture or ornaments). Yāj. and Nār, must be deemed to include this last under the surety for payment. Kāt. (530) 728 says that a surety (lagnaka) may be caused to be given for repayment (of a debt), for appearance (upasthāna), in lawsuits, for honesty and for taking oaths (or ordeals). Acc. to Harita a surety is taken for five purposes viz. for keeping the peace (abhaya),

Different kinds of sureties 

437 

for honesty, for repayment of debt, for delivering the debtor's property to the creditor, for appearance. V. P. P. 248 quotes Vyāsa (who mentions seven kinds of sureties) and remarks that all can ultimately be reduced to three varieties. 

If the surety for appearance cannot produce the person at the time and place agreed upon, he should in that case pay to the creditor what he has bound himself to pay except where the debtor is prevented from appearing by act of God or of the king. But a period of a fortnight, a month or three fortnights at the most should be allowed to the surety to find out the absconding person 729. If he can produce him within that time the surety would be free from liability (Kāt. 531, 532, Bṛ, in S. B. E. vol. 33 p. 327 verse 42). If the surety for appearance cannot (even after time is given) produce the debtor or the debtor dies then the surety has to pay from his own pocket the money due from the debtor (Manu VIII. 158 and Kāt. 532-33). All this is subject to the proviso of the act of God or of the king. 

Sureties of all kinds are personally liable to make good the loss arising from the non-appearance of the debtor, or from his dishonesty or non-payment (Yāj. II. 53, Vişnu VI. 41, Bp, in S, B. E. 33 p. 327 v. 41); but the sons of the surety for appea rance or honesty were not liable, if the surety died 730. Yet if the surety for appearance or honesty stood surety only after taking some security from the debtor for so doing, then even the son would be liable to reimburse from such security the person losing. The liability of sons and grandsons for the suretyship debt of the father or grandfather will be discussed a little later on. If there are several sureties, then each will have to pay a proportionate part of the debt; but if each of the sureties has undertaken the whole liability of the debtor (i. e. if the liability of all is joint and several) then the creditor may at his will recover the whole debt from any one of the several sureties

(Vol. 

(Yaj. II. 55, Nār. IV. 120). Kāt. 538 states 731 a special rule that whichever out of several sureties that have incurred joint and several liability is found present at the place (of the agreement) should be made to pay the debt; if such a surety has gone abroad his son may be made to pay the whole, but if the surety be dead the son should be made to pay only the share of his father (there being several sureties). If a surety being pressed or harassed by a creditor pays openly (before all people) the debt (wholly or in part) 732 then the debtor will be made to pay after three fortnights double of what the surety has to pay (Yaj. II. 56, Nār. IV. 121, Vişgu Dh. S. VI. 44, Kāt. 539). But if the surety pays without being pressed he would get only what he paid and if the debtor reimburses the surety without loss of time then he has not to pay double. These rules apply to mooey lent; but in the case of grain, clothes and liquids the debtor must pay to the surety three, four or eight times respec tively ( Yāj. II. 57). Who could not be accepted as sureties has already been stated (on pp. 291-292 ). 

Several were the modes of the recovery of debts. Manu (VIII. 47-48 ) requires the king to make the debtor repay his debt to the creditor in whatever way he can do it. There is a difference in the modes of recovery according as the liability is admitted by the debtor or not. If liability is denied then the only method is to file a suit for the recovery of the debt. But if the liability is admitted by the debtor, then Manu VIII. 49 (Nār. IV. 122), and Br. (S. B. E. vol. 33 p. 329 v. 54) mention five means of recovery viz. dharma (persuasion), vavahāra (legal proceed ing), chala or upadhi (trick), carita ( sitting down at his door ), or bala (compulsion to do work or confinement). It appears from Ap. Dh. S. (I. 6. 19. 1) that the method of sitting at the door for recovery of debts was known to Ap. (the creditor so doing is designated pratyupavişta ). In a Marwad Inscription

Modes of the recovery of debts

dated samuat 1198 (1141-42 A. D.) this practice is called kaya-orata (yadi brāhmaṇaḥ kāyavratam kętrā mriyate). Vide E. I vol. XI. p. 37 at p. 40. These modes of recovery except vyavahāra are explained by Bșhaspati as follows:733 The method of dharma consists in sending messages (to the debtor ) from his friends and rela tives, in persuading him to pay with sweet worde, by following the debtor (i.e. by persistent dunning) and by frequent requests. Trick consists in the creditor borrowing from the debtor some ornament or other article under the pretext of its being required in a festival and not returning it or in retaining what the debtor has handed over to the creditor for being delivered to another; that is compulsion when the debtor is brought to the creditor's house, is then confined or beaten and thus induced to repay the debt; that is ācarita where the creditor keeps tied his own wife or son or cattle at the debtor's house or sits down at his door (fasting). All these methods could not be employed in the case of all debtors. Kat. (477-480) has already been cited (on p. 383) to show how the king is to employ the various methods in the case of brāhmaṇas, traders &c. If the creditor employs any one of the methods (other than vyavahāra ) and harasses a debtor when the latter claims judicial investigation and there is a doubt or dispute between the two as to the amount, the rate of interest, the liability to pay, the creditor would lose his claim and would have to pay a fine equal (to the claim )734. Kat. 589 and Br.735 (S. B. E. vol. 33, p. 331 verses 63-65) lay this down. But when the debtor admits his liability and yet does not pay and when the creditor therefore employs one of the means (other than a suit) appropriate to the caste and position of the debtor, then, if the debtor complains to the king

against the creditor, the debtor would be compelled by the king to pay the debt and a fine for unnecessary complaint ( Yāj. II. 40, Manu VIII, 176, Visņu Dh. S. VI 19 ). Kāt. (580-584 ) provides that where 736 it is the custom of the country, the creditor may hold the debtor in restraint openly before an assembly of people until he pays what is due, that when a man 80 restrained has an inclination to answer calls of nature, he should be followed behind by the creditor or he should be allowed to go alone but fettered, that he should be allowed to go home for his meals and at night if he furnishes a surety, and that the surety will have to remain in restraint ( while the debtor is absent ), that if the debtor cannot secure a surety or does not accept the proposal of furnishing one he should be confined in jail or should be kept guarded by men; but that a respectable man who is trust-worthy and pure in conduct should not be put in jail, that he should be allowed to go without fetters or after being bound by an oath. Manu VIII. 177, Yāj. II. 43, Nar. IV. 131 lay down that if a debtor is unable to pay a debt then he should be made to do work suitable to his caste in the house of his creditor of the same or higher caste in order to gradually liquidate the debt (but without detriment to his own family) and a brāhmaṇa debtor should be made to pay by easy instalments 737.

husband's debt, but wives of cowherds and those who take a lease of lands for half produce may be arrested for non-payment by the husband. As compared with the harsh legislation against debtors in most ancient and medieval systems of jurisprudence the rules laid down by the smstis are very mild and humane 739. If there were several creditors there was priority among them i.e. the earlier debt prevailed over the later one; a brāhmana creditor however ( whatever the date of his advance) was preferred to a ksatriya or other creditor (Yaj. II, 41, Kāt. 514). Kaut 740 states that the debts owed to the Crown and a śrotriya take precedence over other debts and that unless the debtor is going to abscond several creditors should not simultaneously proceed against one debtor. Section 56 of the Bombay Land Revenue Code makes Government assessment a paramount charge on the land. But aoc. to Kāt. (513) if several debts were contracted in writing on the same date, they should all be treated as equal and paid off pro rata from the debtor's assets if insufficient; but, if a creditor established that a particular article belonging to a debtor was manufactured by the debtor with his money only, that creditor alone got the money recovered by sale of the article ( Kāt. 515 ). Bharadvaja states 741 that if a debtor has no cash then the creditor should be paid by sale of the debtor's other property in order viz. grain, gold, iron, cattle, clothes, land, slaves, and conveyances, ( in the absence of fields ) his garden and lastly his house and in the absence of even a house time should be granted to debtors of the three higher castes,

When a debtor was not able to return the entire debt in a lump, he should write on the back of the document of debt the sums paid by him from time to time or the creditor may pass & receipt (upagata or praveśapatra, as the Mit. designates it) to the debtor signed by himself (Yaj. II. 93, Nār. IV. 114, Vişnu Dh. S. VI. 26). If the creditor, though requested by the debtor, would not pass a receipt he was to lose the balance of his debt (Nar. IV, 114). Nār. IV. 115 and Bṛ. (S. B. E. vol. 33 p. 332 verse 66 ) further provide that if the creditor does not write down (either on the bond itself or in a separate document) the money recovered by dharma or some other method then the debtor himself will be entitled to interest on the amount paid by him. 741When the whole debt is paid off, the creditor should tear off the bond of debt or he may execute another document in order to show that the debtor is freed from the debt (if the original is lost or is not within easy reach) and when a debt is borrowed in the presence of witnesses, it should be re turned in the presence of the same or other witnesses (Y&j. II. 94, Vişņu Dh. S. VI. 24-25). Nar. IV. 116 requires the creditor to return the document when the whole debt is paid off or to announce openly to others that it has been paid 742. 

It has now to be seen who (other the man himself) are liable to pay a man's debt. The liability to pay another's debt may arise on three grounds, (1) religious, (2) equitable and nioral, (3) legal, such as agency (express or implied) or authority. That the song and grandsons of the original debtor are liable to pay on religious grounds the debt of the father is expressly stated by numerous writers such as Kaut. 743 III. 11, Yāi. II. 50, Nar, IV. 4, Bṛ. (s. B. E, vol. 33 p. 328 verse 49 ), Kāt. (560), Vṛddha-Hārīta VI. 250-51, Vişnu Dh. S. VI. 27.

Great-grandson's liability for debts 

443 

The important question is whether the smrtis declare the liabi. lity of the great-grandson. It is clear that smptis like that of Bř. expressly say that the great-grandson is not liable to pay his great-grandfather's debt. The Vişņu Dh. S. VI. 28 says that the descendants beyond the grandson need not pay if they are unwilling to pay. Others like Nar. IV, 4 and Kat, say that the obligation to return a debt ceases from the fourth. The question is what is meant by the fourth i. e. is it meant to exclude, in calculating, the original debtor or to include him? It is possible to hold (particularly because the great-grandson is not expressly mentioned in most emộtis) that the fourth means 'inclusive of the original debtor'. But this appears to be in conflict with the rule in Manu IX. 137 (which is the same as Baud. Dh, S. II. 9. 6, Vas. 17. 5, Visnu Dh. S. 15. 46 ) that the son, grandson, and great-grandson confer the greatest spiritual benefit on the ancestor, the rule (Manu IX. 186, Nār. IV. 6) that pindas (in srāddha) are to be offered by three persons in descent and the general rule that whoever takes the inheritance must offer the pinda and pay the debts of the ancestor (Gaut. XII. 37, Yāj. II. 51, Nār. IV. 23, Visnu Dh. S. XV. 40 and VI. 29). Therefore, following the canons, viz. the rights to property aro co-extensive with the liability to perform sraddha and to pay off debts (which is quite logical and reasonable), that the texts relating to the same subject matter must be harmonized and reconciled as far as it is reasonably possible 744 to do (ekavākyatā-nyāya), that apparently conflicting texts are to be assigned their appropriate spheres (vişayavyavastha), and that a direct conflict (and so an option) is to be presumed only if no other recourse is open, the Mitākşarā and other commentators put forward the interpretation that the texts stating that the great-grandson is not liable to pay the great-grandfather's debt apply only to cases where the great-grandson inherits no ances tral property, but that he is liable if he takes ancestral property. Dr. Jolly in his note on Nār. IV. 6 (in S. B. E. vol. 33 p. 44) remarks:"the doctrine, viz. the liability to pay debts contracted

by an ancestor extends to the great-grandson, is opposed to the teaching of such an eminent authority as Vijñānesvara, who maintains in the Mitākgard that the great-grandson 745 is not liable for debts contracted by his great-grandfather, and conversely that he does not inherit his property. He makes similar remarks in his Tagore Law Lectures for 1885 (on 'adoption, partition' &c. p. 171). Dr. Jolly is under some misapprehension since the Mit, in two places deals with this matter and expressly states that the great-grandson is liable to pay debts contracted by his great-grandfather if he has taken ancestral estate but not other wise. The following propositions are deducible from the smrti texts and authoritative commentaries like the Mit. and the Viramitrodaya (Vyavabāraprakāśa). The 746 first proposition is that the debts of a man must be paid by his three descendants (son, grandson and great-grandson) if they have ancestral estate in their hands (Mit. on Yāj. II. 51 quoted in note 745, Sm. C. II p. 171, V. P. p. 264). The 2nd proposition is that even when no ancestral estate was taken by the descendants the son was liable to pay his father's debts with interest, the grandson was liable to pay his grandfather's debt but without interest and the great-grandson was not liable to pay even the principal, if he was unwilling to pay. This proposition is enunciated by Vişņu Dh. S. VL 27-28, Bř.(S. B. E. vol. 33 p. 328

Liability of sons and other descendants

V. 49 referred to on p. 443) and Kat. 556 747. In Narasimharav v. Antaji 2 Bom. H. C.R. 61 it was held ( probably following Bṛhas pati, though not quoted in the judgment) that the grandson was liable to pay the debt of his grandfather without interest even if there was no ancestral estate. This was felt to be a great hardship on heirs (taking no ancestral estate) and in order to remove it Bombay Act VII of 1866 (the Hindu Heirs' Relief Act) was passed whereby it is provided that a son or grandson is not liable to be sued for the debts of his deceased ancestor merely by reason of his being such a son or grandson and that the son, grandson or other heir shall be liable only to the extent of the assets that come to his hands. The game is the law laid down in other parts of India by judicial decisions. Br. (S. B. E. vol. 33 p. 328 verse 48 ) recommends that the father's debt must be paid first of all and after that one's own debt; but a debt of the grandfather must always be paid even before the prece ding 748 two kinds of debt. These two propositions of Hindu jurists are very lucidly, but succinctly, set forth by the Vira mitrodaya quoted below 749. The third proposition (which is an exception to the above two) is that even a son is not liable to pay certain illegal and immoral debts of his father. This pro position will be discussed a little further on. A fourth proposi tion is that even when the father is not dead, the son, grandson or great-grandson may be liable to pay the father's or other ancestor's debt under certain circumstances. Yāj. II. 50 pro vides that sons (and grandsons ) must pay the debt of the father when he is dead or has gone to a distant country or is afflicted with an incurable disease.

548-550 state that when the father, though living and near, becomes an ascetic (acc.to Visnu), is afflicted with such diseases or calamities as blindness from birth or loss of caste ( due to grave sins), lunacy, tuberculosis, leprosy and other (incurable) diseases or when he has left his country or has gone on a long journey or is very old (above 80) the son will have to pay the debt of the father after the twentieth year (from his going abroad). Acc. to V. R. (p. 50) if the father's disease was incu rable or if it was certain that he would not return from his journey then the son was bound to pay at once and was not entitled to wait for 20 years. Kat. (552-553) introduces 751_a further restriction that even when the father is dead, if the son has not attained years of discretion (i.e. if he is a minor) he need not pay the debt of his father during his minority; but when the proper time to pay arrives he must pay the debt; otherwise the (ancestors) may remain in hell. Thus the son's liability during the father's lifetime or absence was not abso lute but limited according to the smrtis and digests; judicial decisions, however, have brushed all this aside and the son's liability to pay his father's debts during the latter's lifetime is now as absolute as after his death. This will be discussed further on. 

According to all smrti writers even the son, though he may have taken the ancestral estate, is not liable to pay certain debts of the father which are compendiously described as * illegal or immoral' in the decisions of courts. Gaut. 752 XII.

What debts need not be paid by sons 

38, Kaut. III. 16, Manu VIII. 159-160, Vas. 16. 31, Yaj. II. 47 and 54, Nār. IV. 10, Bp. (8. B. E. vol. 33 p. 329 verge 51), Kāt. (564-565), Ušanas and Vyāsa provide that the son is not bound to pay the following debts of his father viz. those incurred as a surety (for honesty or appearance), for drinking or in gamb ling, those arising from idle promises (to bards, wrestlers and the like), debts for promises made under the influence of wrath or illicit love to women, the balance of a fine or toll and those that are not vyāvahārika. A debt arising from wrath is explai ned by Kāt, as one where the father causes physical injury to another or destroys another's property through anger and then promises something to pacify the person wronged. As regards the suretyship debts of the father, Yaj. II. 54, Vyāsa and Kāt. (561) provide that when the father was a surety for payment, then the son was bound to pay the principal of the debt for which the father stood surety, but the son of the son was not liable at all to pay the suretyship debt of his grandfather even when the latter was a surety for payment 753. These verses about the debts which the son was not bound to pay have been quoted and explained in numerous decisions of the courts. But as this work does not profess to be a treatise on modern Hindu Law those cases are passed over here. What is meant by * debts that are not vyāvahārika' has presented the greatest difficulty to the medieval commentaries and digests and also to modern courts as noted below 754.

where the father became a surety for appearance (or honesty ) after receiving a pledge from the person whose gurety he became, then the son of the surety may be made to pay the money due from that pledge in case the father is dead or has gono abroad 755 

The case law on the subject of the father's debts and the son's liability to pay them has assumed enormous proportions. This is not the place to discuss the case-law. But as the courts in India profess to follow the Hindu Law of the sages and medieval digests, it is necessary to examine some of the principles laid down by the latest decision of the Privy Council. In Brij Narain v. Mangla Prasad 51 I. A. 129 (=46 All. 95) the following five propositions are laid down by the Privy Council ( at p. 139): (1) the managing member of a joint undivided estate cannot alienate or burden the estate qua manager except for purposes of necessity ; (2) if he is the father and the other members are the sons, he may, by incurring debt, so long as it is not for an immoral purpose, lay the estate open to be taken in execution proceeding upon a decree for payment of that debt; (3) if he purports to burden the estate by mortgage then, unless that mortgage is to discharge an antecedent debt, it would not bind the estate; (4) antecedent debt means antecedent in fact as well as in time, that is to say, that the debt must be truly independent and not part of the transaction impeached; (5) there is no rule that this result is affected by the question whether the father, who contracted the debt or burdened the estate, is alive or dead. It

In Kottapalli v, Kanuparti 58 Mad. 375, where the father executed a surety bond that a certain judgment debtor would file an insolvency petition within a specified period and the debtor failed to do so, it was held that the guarantee was one for confidence or bonesty and that the sons were not liable on the father's death. Similarly in Dhir Narain v. Shiva Sahay A, I, R, 1935 Pataa 127 it was held that song are not liable under Hindu Law where the father atood surety for appearance only.. Io Narayan v. Venkatacharya 6 Bom. L. R. 434 it was bold that under the law of the Mitaksara a grandson is not liable to pay a debt which his grandfather contracted as a surety unless the latter in accepting the liability of a surety received some consideration for it,

Divergence of modern decisions from smītis 

449 

is necessary to see how far these principles agree with or deviate from the law of the smrtis and the digests. The first proposition is in consonance with the law of the smrtis and of the commentaries like the Mit. Yāj. II. 45 provides 756 that whatever debt is contracted by the head of the joint family for the necessities of the family has to be paid by the members who take the ancestral estate when the head is dead or goes to a foreign country. The Mit. on Yāj. II. 114 quotes and explains & smrti text "Even one (the head or manager of a joint family) can make a mortgage, sale or gift of immovable property in a time of distress, for the necessities of the family and particular ly for religious and charitable purposes". What is meant by * debts in times of distress' and 'kuțumbārthe' is explained by Kāt. (542-43 ) quoted in n. 756. This has been the foundation of numerous cases, the first and the most important of which is that of Hunoomanpersaud v. Mussumat Babooee 757 6 Moore's Indian Appeals p. 393 (P. C.). The 2nd proposition laid down

IV. 3, Manu VIII. 166, Vişnu Db. S. VI, 39 contain similar provisions, all of them employing the word gue (for the purposes or benefit of the family). 

757. At pp. 423 and 424 of 6 Moore's Indian Appeals the Privy Council employ the following words that have become classical : The power of the manager for an infant heir to charge an estate not bis owo is under the Hindu Law a limited and qualified power. It can only be exercised rightly in a case of need or for the benefit of the estate. The actual pressure on the estate, the danger to be averted or the benefit to be conferred upon it in the particular instance, is the thing to be regarded.... They think that if the leader does inquire and acts bonestly, the real existence of an alleged sufficient and reasonably credited necessity is not a condition precedent to the validity of his charge and they do not think that under such circun stances, he is bound to see to the application of the money. The words 

the actual pressure, the benefit to be conferred' and the remarks about inquiry by the lender are a prolific source of litigation and have given rise to a mass of case-law. In L. R. 51 1. A. 129 at p. 137 the Privy Council them selves say that the distinction" made between secured and vosecured debts of the father is anomalous. They give an instance. 'A father who is manager borrows a like sum from A and B. TO A he gives a mortgage on the family estate containing a personal covenant. To B he gives a simple acknowledgment of loan. B sues and gets a decree; on this decree execution can follow and the estate can be taken. A, suing on his mortgage, cannot recover. (because the debt was not antecedent).

above also follows from several smrtis (such as Yaj. IL. 50, Visnu Dh. 8. VI. 35, Nār. IV. %, 4, 6) and the rules about immoral debts cited above. But it is difficult to understand why the Privy Council make a distinotion between a simple personal money debt of the father and a debt secured by a mortgage ( as in propositions % and 3). The ancient texts and commentaries make no such distinction. Vide 42 Mad. 711 at p. 731, 26 Bom. 206 at pp. 217-219 (F. B.) and 60 Bom, 311 (F. B.) where this is pointed out. With the greatest respect it must be said that the distinction is not only without dharmaśāstra authority, but is also anomalous. The distinction between 'antecedent debt' and a debt contracted at the time of execut ing a mortgage is unknown to the emptis or digests. The Privy Council had used for the first time in a very early case (viz. Suraj Bunsi v. Sheo Proshad 61. A. 88 at p. 106 = 5 Cal. 148, 171 ) the words 'antecedent debt '758 for which there is nothing corresponding in the Sanskrit authorities and round which elaborate arguments came to be centred in numerous later cases. According to the Privy Council (proposition 5) the son's pious duty to pay his father's debt is as absolute during the father's lifetime as after his death. It has been shown above that the duty was not absolute but qualified and limited during the father's life according to the smartis. 

Yaj. II. 5%, Kaut. (IIL 11 ) provide 759 that husband and wife; father and son and brothers cannot, as long as they are undivided, stand sureties for each other or be debtors and creditors of each other or be witnesses for each other. The Mit. has a long note on Yāj. II. 52. It shows that a wife may be divided us to estate from the husband if the latter desires (as laid down in Yaj. II. 114) and that in that case there may be the relation of debtor and creditor between them. 

758. The proposition laid dowa in 6 1. A. at p. 106 is 'where joint ancestral property has passed out of a joint family, either under a con veyanco executed by a father in consideration of an antecedent debt or in order to raise money for an antecedent debt or under a sale in execution of & decroo for the father's debt, his sons, by reason of their duty to pay their fatber's debts, cannot recover that property, unless thoy show that the debts were contracted for immoral purposes and that the purchasers had notice that they were so contracted'.

The wife's liability for husband's debts 

451 

The Mit. further explains the sūtras of Apastamba 760 (Ap. Dh. S. II. 6. 14. 16-19) which lay down there can be no division between husband and wife, for since the day of marriage they have to perform religious rites together, they also participate together in the rewards of merit arising from religious rites and also in the wealth acquired; for this reason when the husband has gone abroad if the wife spends on necessary occasions ( out of the family wealth) it is not declared to be theft'. The Mit. explains that the absence of division between husband and wife is restricted to religious rites performed with $rauta fires or smārta fire and in the rewards of meritorious acts and not in all actions or as to all property. Therefore in other charities where no sacred fire is required (purta acts such as constructing a well or a public park ) they have separate rights. Vide S. V. pp. 353 for various explanations of Bharuchi and others on Ap. Dh. S. and V. P. pp. 255-56. 

The father is not bound to pay his son's personal debt; the husband is not liable to pay the wife's debt, nor the wife her husband's or son's. But in all these cases if the debt is incurred for the benefit or purposes of the family by the son, the wife or the husband then the father, husband or wife respectively would be liable (Yaj. II. 47, Nār. IV. 10–11, Kāt. 545, 579) 761 If the father promised to pay his son's individual debt or if he appro ved or acquiesced in it he was liable to pay it. Manu VIII. 167, Yaj. II. 45, Nār. IV. 12, Br. (S. B. E. 33 p. 329 v. 50), Kāt. (545) provide that a debt incurred for the purposes of the family by any one such as the son, brother, uncle, the wife, the mother, the pupil or a servant or a slave even without the consent of the head of the family when he has gone abroad, should be paid by the head of the family. This liability and the liability when the manager of a family contracts a debt for the benefit or neces sities of the family arise from agency (implied) or authority, Kaut. ( II. 11 ) holds that the husband may be seized (for work)

if he starts to go abroad without providing for the return of the debt contracted by his wife.762 

The general rule that the husband was not liable to pay the wife's debt had an exception viz, the husband was liable for the debts of the wife in the case of cowherds, vintners, actors, washermen and hunters (and the like) whose income depends on their wives and whose household expenses are defrayed by their wives (Yaj. II. 48, Visnu Dh. S. VI. 37, Nar. IV. 19). Similarly the rule that the wife was not liable for the husband's debt had certain exceptions, viz. a debt of the husband which she promised to pay because he was dying or going abroad or which was contracted jointly with her husband 763 ( Yāj. II. 49, Nār. IV. 16-17). The Mit. on Yaj. II. 49 answers the objection raised by some that, as according to Manu VIII. 416 ( = Udyogaparva 33.64) the wife, son and slave are without property and whatever they earn is acquired for him to whom they belong, the wife would not be able to pay anything at all. The reply is that this verse of Manu does not mean that a wife or son can own no property at all, but all that it declares is that they have no independent power to dispose of their property. 

The order in which persons are liable to pay a man's debts after his death is declared by Yay. II. 51, Nar. IV. 23, Br. (S.B.E. vol. 33 p. 329 verse 52), Kat. (562, 577), Visnu76 VI. 29-30.

Liability for the debts of the deceased 

453 

Whoever takes the wealth of the deceased ( whether a son or a collateral heir ) is primarily responsible to pay the debts of the deceased; but if the deceased died without leaving any property, then he who takes his wife has to pay the deceased's debts ; if there be no wealth or taker of the deceased's widow, then the son even if he succeeds to no wealth has to pay. This liability may be said to be based on the equitable and moral principle that whoever takes the wealth of the deceased or his widow (over whom the deceased had a sort of dominion) was bound to pay his debts. There appears to be some confict between the texts; but it is more apparent than réal. Verges (like Kāt. 577 ) where the son is placed after the taker of wealth and before the taker of the widow refer to a son who has separate and independent wealth of his own and is more wealthy than the taker of the widow (though he himself being disqualified did not succeed to, ancestral wealth). When there is no wealth and there are several sons one of whom is congenitally blind or otherwise incompetent to succeed then the other sons are liable. From the fact that the taker of the widow is made liable for the debts of the first husband it should not be supposed that the ancient sages approved of widow-remarriage. On the contrary they condemned it ( vide Manu V. 162), but, as the Mit. (on Yāj. II. 51 ) remarks remarriages took place by custom among certain castes and nothing could prevent persons from taking widows as kept mistresses. Therefore as the wife was half of the husband (acc. to Vedic and other passages q. In H. of Dh. vol. IL pp. 428, 584 n. ) she was practically the husband's wealth (Nār. IV. 22 expressly says so ) 765 and so the taker of the widow was saddled with the obligation to pay the debts of the deceased. This sentiment continued to modern times and in the Bombay Presidency the Legislature had to declare ( by Bombay Act VII of 1866, sec. 4) that no person who has married a widow shall merely by reason of such marriage, be liable for any of the debts of any prior husband of such widow'. The Vaijayanti on Vişnu Dk. S: VI. 30 quotes Yaj. II. 51 and Nār. IV. 23 and

explains them differently. According to it the word 'putra' (in Yaj. II. 51 ) is. qualified by all the three adjectives via "rikthagrāha', 'yoşidgrāha' (one who is married) and 'ananya. sritadravya'(one who has no wife nor child and one who has taken no ancestral wealth, either because he does not desire it or because none exists). Therefore according to it among sons, the son that takes ancestral wealth has to pay the debts of the father, on failure of such a son when some of the sons are married and some are not, the married ones have to repay ancestral debts and lastly when there are no married sons the one that is wifeless, childless and also without wealth has to pay them. 

Niksepa ( deposit). The words niksepa, upanidhi and nyāsa are sometimes said to be synonyms (as done by Amara ) 766, though several ancient works define them separately. According to Yaj. II. 65 upanidhi is the deposit of an article enclosed in a box or the like made with another without telling him of the contents of the box. Yaj. II. 67 holds nyāsa and niksepa to be different from upanidhi. Nārada 767 as quoted in the Mit. on Yaj. II. 65 defines upanidhi as the deposit of an article in a sealed receptacle without counting it in the presence of the person to whom it is entrusted and without telling him what the receptacle contains, while a nikşepa is a deposit entrusted to a man after counting the articles in his presence. Manu VIII, 149 (Vas. 16. 18), Kaut. III. 12 hold niksepa and upa nidhi to be distinct. A verse quoted by Kșirasvāmin on Amara defines nyāsa as an open deposit and niksepa as the delivery of some goods to an artist or crafteman for being worked up or manufactured. Nār. (V. 1 and 5) defines niksepa as the deposit of one's articles with another through confidence, while upanidhi is defined in the same way as Yāj. II. 65. Visvarūpa 768 defines nyāsa as an open deposit for safe custody and nikşepa as delivery of one's article to another for handing over to a

third. Kat. (592) makes 769 upanidhi a generio term for all bail. ments such as a sold article remaining in the hands of the vendor, & deposit, a pledge, bailment to one for delivery to another, loan of article for temporary use, goods handed over for sale to an agent. The Mit. on Yaj. II. 67 defines nyasa as handing over to some member in the house an article in the absence of the head of the house for delivery to the head of the house and nikşepa as a deposit in the presence of the deposites himself. The V. P. p. 280 briefly distinguishes the three as noted below.770 

Nikşepa or upanidhi was a bailment made in trust and differed from an ādhi in this that the former was not given by way of security for a debt or for collecting interest but in confidence for safe custody.771 Br. (SBE vol. 33p. 332 verse 2) says that such a deposit is made with another when one is leaving one's home, or through fear of the king or for depriving one's kinsmen.772 Manu VIII. 179 (=Nar. V.2) says that one should entrust a deposit to a person who is born of a good family, is well-conducted, knows dharma, speaks the truth, has a large family, is wealthy and straightforward. The person with whom a deposit is made generally receives no personal benefit from it; hence the smrtis (such as Br. in SBE 33 p. 333 verses 6-8) extol the holder 773 of a deposit made in trust to be as meritorious as one who makes gifts of gold or other inferior

metals or clothes and condemn the misappropriation of a deposit or the losing of it through negligence as very sinful. The idea is that no one is bound to accept a deposit, but when a person accepts it, his primary duty is to preserve it with oare and the next duty is to return it at the time agreed or on demand. The obligation arises from the trust reposed in a person. The rights of the bailee are limited as compared to those of the mortgagee or pledgee, but the very fact of his custody in trust clothes him with certain rights. The amount of care required of the depositoe is the same as in the case of an ādhi, viz. he is to take the same care of it as he takes of his own goods and is not liable if the deposit is lost ( along with his own property ) through act of God or the king or is stolen by thieves (Manu VIII. 189, Yāj. II. 66, Nār. V. 9 and 12, Br. in S.B.E. 33 p. 333, verse 10, Kāt. 593 ).774 In the Mșochakatika Cārudatta accepts liability for the loss of the ornaments deposited with him by Vasantasenā, though they were stolen, because of his high sense of chivalry and of his idea that proper care was not taken by him or his friend. But Nār. V. 9 is careful to add that the loss through vis major or through theft must be real and not fraudulently brought about. 775 Nār. V. 6 and Bp. (in SBE 33 p. 334 verge 14 ) state that a deposit may be made in the presence of witnesses or without them, that it should be returned in the same way and condition in which it was made and that if there is a dispute, it may be settled by ordeal ( when there are no witnesses ). 776 The article deposited must be returned in the same condition ( as regards seal &c.) in which it was handed over (Yāj. II. 65 ). It must also be returned to the man himself wbo made the deposit and not to his co-owners ( Manu VIII. 185, Br, in SBE 33 p. 333 verse 9).777 He is estopped

from recognising the title of any one except the depositor, as in section 116 of the Indian Evidence Act. But if the bailor be dead the bailee can return it of his own accord without demand to the co-owners (Manu VIII. 186 = Nār. V. 10). In doing so however he must not return it to one of several heirs, but to all or in the presence of all. The loss of a deposit may be due to the fact that the bailee consumes it by using it, or to the bailee's negligence or to his ignorance. In these cases the bailee was made to reimburse the bailor for the loss. But Kāt. ( 597 ) 778 makes a difference, viz. when a bailes consumes the deposit by use he should be made to pay the price with interest, when he loses it through negligence he is to pay only the price (but without interest) and if he loses through ignorance, then he is to pay a little less (i. e. less by one-fourth ) than the price. Vide Br. (SBE vol. 33 p. 333 verse 11 ) and Nār. V. 8. If a bailor knowing the proposed bailee to be a careless man deposits his goods with him, the bailee is not liable even if the goods are lost from any cause whatever ( Kāt. 599 ).779 If immediately on demand by the depositor the bailee does not return the thing deposited or it is lost after demand from any cause whatever (including act of God or king ), the bailee' has to return the thing or the price of the thing (when lost) and also is liable to be fined by the king in the same amount ( Yāj. IL. 66, Nār. V.7). If the bailee makes use of the article bailed without the permission of the bailor, he should be fined by the king and should be made to return the thing bailed with interest ( Yāj. II. 67, Nār. V. 8). In the Rāj. T. ( VIIL 124-157 ) occurs the story of a person who had deposited one lakh of dināras with a merchant and had withdrawn some money from time to time. It further states that, when the balance was demanded, the merchant furnished a statement of accounts giving a list of

fiotitious items of withdrawals for many years with interest and showing that very little of the deposit was left. The king brought home the fraud to the merchant and ordered that the original deposit being used by the merchant should bear interest. 

Kat. (506) provides that when a deposit, a balance of interest, purchase price ( not paid though the article be delivered to vendee ), or sale price ( article sold being retained by vendor though price is paid) is not returned or paid when demand is made, it carries interest at 5 per cent (from the date of demand ).780 Manu VIII. 191 (which is almost the same as Nār. V. 13) provides that where a bailes does not return the deposit though demand ed or where a person without making a deposit claims it from a person, both are to be punished as a thief by the king and to be made to pay a fine equal in amount to the price of the bailed article (claimed). The deposit has to be taken back at the proper time by the depositor and the bailee has to avoid returning it at an improper time; if the latter returns at an improper time he should be made to pay a fine double of the value of the thing 781 (Kat. 601 ). 

Yaj. II. 67, Nār. V. 14, Br. 782 ( S. B. E. vol. 33 p. 334 verge 15 ) extend these rules about niksepa to other kinds of bail ments viz. to yācitaka ( an article such as an ornament borrowed from a man on a festive occasion), anvāhita ( what is handed over to a third man and is the property of another and has been pledged with a man), nyāsa, upanidhi, filpinyāsu ( giving an article such as gold to an artisan like a goldsmith for preparing an ear-ring or the like), pratinyāsa (mutual deposit). Some of the rules about yācitaka are stated above

Rules about loss of yācitaka 

459 

(pp. 426-427). Kaut. 783 III. 12 states that a yūcitaka or avakrita (lent on hire ) article should be returned in the same condition in which it was received. If lost through act of God or king or through theft (after taking proper care ) the depositee would not be liable. Kāt. ( 610 ) provides 784 that he who having taken the loan of an article for use does not deliver it even on demand should be restrained (by the owner ) and forcibly made to return it and fined by the king if he does not return it; he should be made to pay the price with interest ( if the thing be lost after demand). If the loan of an article was taken for a specified period or for a particular occasion or purpose and a demand for return be made in the middle and the article is not returned when demanded, the person taking the loan would not be made to pay the price : but if a person who has taken on loan an article does not return it after the period fixed has expired or the purpose is served, the borrower must offer to the owner the price if the article be destroyed or lost and if he does not return even after demand (when the period has ended ) the borrower would have to pay the price with interest. 

Kat. (609) states a reasonable counter-exception to the rule in 606 viz. 'when the owner of an article borrowed by another is likely to sustain loss if the article borrowed were not returned on demand, then the borrower should be made to deliver it even though the time fixed has not ended or the pur pose of the loan was only half fulfilled'. 

There are some special rules about $ilpinyāsa also. Kat. ( 603-604) provides that if an artisan or craftsman retains an article delivered to him beyond the time that was settled (or

agreed) for finishing the work he should be made to pay (its price ) even if the article was lost through act of God, but the artisan shall not be liable to pay the price if the article were to be lost through defects in the article itself; if (however ) what is delivered for being worked or polished is destroyed through the fault of the artisan he should be made to pay the price 785 

From the fact that Kāt. 596 (quoted above in n. 778) employs the expression 'dāpyah sa eva tat' (he alone who misappro priates or causes loss of a deposit by negligence), the words of Gaut. XII. 39 ( quoted above under adhi) and the fact that nikşopa is a title distinct from rņādāna (under which alone the liability of sons, grandsons, and great-grandsons is expressly declared ) it follows that song are not liable for the misappro priation or loss of a deposit or article bailed to their father or other ancestor provided they have not themselves joined or helped in the embezzlement or loss. This is made clear by Haradatta on Gaut. XII. 39, the Vivādacintāmaņi and the Vivādacandra quoted below 786. 

It is interesting to note that Nār. 787 V. 15 places on the same level (as to liability for loss ) with the depositee and the like the man who takes in his charge a minor that has & good deal of wealth i.e. the person undertaking the position of the guardian of a minor's property has to take as much care of it as of his own and is liable in the same circumstances as a

788. The British India Courts have been very much exercised over the question of the liability of ancestral property in the hands of the son for the obligations incurred by the father by his misconduct or embezzlement either as agent or manager for another or as guardian of a minor's property. It would follow from the passages quoted in n. 786 that ancestral property in the hands of the sons is not liable, acc, to some of our digests, if the father used or lost a deposit or loaned article by his negligence or mismanaged a minor's property. It is firmly established that the son is not liable for a debt facurred by the father in circumstances which would render the father liable to a criminal prosecution, Vide Toshanpal Singh v. Distriot Judge of Agra 61 I. A. 350. In the latest case on the point, Govindprasad u. Raghunathprasadx41 Bom. L. R. : 589 (F. B.) the exemption is carried further and it is recognized that as to the exemption of the son for 'avyāu. gharika' debts of the father, there are many cases which cannot be recon ciled, that it is repugnant to good sense to construe ancient texts in the light of a system of criminal Jurisprudence developed long after and that tho correct rule is to hold that the son can claim immunity when he proves that the debt of the father was of a character which was illegal, dishonest or inmoral (p. 602)' though difficult cases may arise in the application of this rule. It would be far beyond the scope of this work to cite or discuss the other numerous decisions,OY

CHAPTER XVII ASVĀMIVIKRAYA ( sale by one not the owner ). 

The different modes of the sources of ownership have already been referred to ( H. of Dh. vol. II. pp. 130 ff) and will be referred to again under dayabhāga. According to Nār. VII. 1 and Br. (SBE vol. 33 p. 335 verse 2) when 789 a person, who holds an open deposit, a sealed deposit, an article bailed for delivery to another, stolen property, an article borrowed for some festival, a pledge, or property lost by a stranger and found ( by him ), sells it in secret ( or behind the back of the owner ) it is to be considered as a sale by one who is not the rightful owner. Vyasa has a similar verse. The word 'sells' is only illustrative and includes gifts and pledges. Similarly as most sales by one not the owner are clandestinely brought about, Bs. employs the words in secret' but even if the sale is effected openly the same consequences may follow. The same rules will apply to an article lost by the owner and found by a stranger. Kat. ( 612 ) provides 790 that a sale, gift, or pledge, made by one who is not the owner, should be rescinded ( by the king or judge), Manu VIII. 199 and Nar. (q. by Sm. C. II. p. 213, V. P. p. 291 ) and others say the same thing. Yāj. II. 168, Nār. VII. 2 provide that the owner is entitled to recover his property from the person that purchases from one who is not the owner. If the buyer purchases an article not in the open market, then he is liable for punishment; if he purchases from one who could have no means of posgessing the thing sold (such as a slave without the master's consent) or for a very inadequate price or at a very unusual hour (at midnight or

Such a sale is a fraudulent one. If the buyer purchases (through ignorance ) in market overt from one who is not the owner, he incurs no blame ( no punishment), but he may have to hand over the article to the real owner ( Vişnu Dh. 8. V 164-166 ).791 The purchaser from one not the real owner can free himself by producing the vendor (called inūla in Manu VIII. 202, Bộ. and Kat. ) and should not attempt to conceal from whom he came by the thing, otherwise he would be liable to be punished equally with the vendor as a thief (Nar. VII. 4). Br. ( SBE 33 p. 335 versd 3), Manu VIII. 201 and Yāj. II. 170 say that when the vendor has been produced by the vondee, then the latter is not to be proceeded against, but the vendor has to litigate with the real owner who has lost his property and when the vendor loses the suit he has to pay the price to the buyer and a fine to the king and the owner gets his property back. 792 If the vendor has gone abroad adequate time should be granted to the purchaser to produce him ( Kāt. 615). The purchaser in order to escape blame (punishment) has to produce the vendor and if that cannot be done owing to the vendor's absence he has to prove that he, purchased 793 openly (Bp. in SBE 33 p. 335 v. 4, Manu VIII. 202, Kāt. 615, 618-619). If he cannot do any of these two, then the purchaser would be liable to pay the price to the real owner as claimed and a fine to the king. Manu VIII. 198 prescribes that one who sells without being the owner but being a member of the owner's family should be fined 600 paņas, while a vendor unconnected with the real owner's family should be dealt with as a thief. The same rule applies to a

vendor selling another's article through ignorance or mistake and one doing so with full knowledge. The person who has lost a chattel and claims it from the finder is described as nāştika 74 in Kauţ. III. 16, Manu VIII. 202, Kāt. ( 614) and elsewhere, the word being derived from naşta ( what is lost). The idea is that openly purchasing an article in the presence of a number of people for an adequate price negatives fraudulent intent and leads to the inference of a purchase in good faith and such a purchaser even though he may have to part with the chattel to the real owner when the latter proves his title, incurs no blame and is entitled to recover from the vendor, if he has to surrender the article, the price paid by him. When a person claims & lost article as his he has first to prove his title and possession by evidence (such as that of his kinsmen or a document &c. ) and that he had not sold or donated or abandoned it; 95 after he has proved his title the purchaser is called upon to prove his purchase as honest by evidence i. e. by producing the vendor or by showing that he purchased openly and for adequate price (Kāt. 613, Yaj. II. 170). When this is done the purchaser escapes blame but has to surrender the article to the true owner. Kat. (616 ) adds 796 that in the case of 'agvāmi-vikraya' no other means of proof whether divine or human (except the evidence of witnesses such as kinsmen) is declared to be proper. Acc. to the V. P. p. 293 other evidence and even ordeals may be admissi ble in sale without ownership, but the Sm. O. p. 216 and the Madanaratna say that on account of the express words of Kat. this is not possible. If the owner who alleges the loss of an article fails to prove his title and prior possession he has to pay a fine to the king equal to fth of the price of the article, Kāt. ( 620 ) and Kaut. (.III. 16 ) state that on failure to prove his title the person claiming 797 the article as his should be fined as a thief, in order to deter (others) from taking undue advantage (i. e. preferring false claims ).

provide that when the real owner finds his lost article in the hands of a stranger he should get him apprehended by the royal officers (such as chauroddharanika, acc. to Mit. ), but that if the owner thinks that much time will be lost or distance will have to be traversed ( for going to officers ) he should himself seize the person and bring him before the court. The Mit. explains that the buyer should have the seller arrested and, if the seller is dead or gone abroad, that he should hand over the article to 

· the real owner. Where a purchase has been made in the midst of a row of traders to the knowledge of the king's officers, but from a vendor whose habitation was unknown or where ( after the purchase ) the vendor dies, the real owner (of the thing sold by one not the owner) will recover his own property after paying half the price to the purchaser, since the rule of justice in such a case so requires, because to purchase from one ( whose habitation is ) not known is a fault (in the purchaser ) and not taking proper care (of one's goods ) is also a fault in the real owner (Bř. in S. B. E. vol. 33 pp. 335-36 verses 7-9 or Kāt. 621-623 )799, Marici (q. by Aparārka p. 775, Sm. C. II. p. 217 ) has similar provisions. Br. (S. B, E. vol. 33 p. 335 verse 800 6) provides that in a suit where there is no evidence the king shall take into consideration the character of the litigants and give a decision according as the credibility of the parties is equal, greater or less.

CHAPTER XVIII 

SAMBHŪYA-SAMUTTHĀNA 801 (A joint undertaking, partnership). 

Where traders or others (like actors, musicians or artisans) carry on a business jointly it is termed a partnership (Nar. VI. 1 and Kat. 624).802_Bx. (SBE Vol. 33 p. 336 verses 1-2) says that a man should carry on a joint business with other persons of good family, that are clever, active, intelligent (or educated), familiar with coins, skilled in ( controlling ) expenditure and income, honest and valiant ( or enterprising ) and that joint undertakings like trade should not be carried on by prudent men with persons (partners ) who are weak or lazy or afflicted with disease or are unlucky or destitute ( of money ), 803 The meaning is not that all the above qualities must exist in all partners, but that according to the nature of the undertaking some of these qualities will be absolutely necessary. Nar. VI. 2-3, Yaj. II. 259, Br. (SBE vol. 33 pp. 336-337 verses 3 and 4) prescribe that the expenses, loss, profit or work of those who jointly lend gold, grain or liquids shall be according to the capital put in by each. 804 The duty of each is to act honestly towards the others, whether they are present or absent, 

801. सम्भूय is the indeclinable past participle of the root भू with सम् and means 'having formed together or come together' and Eura means 'under taking'. So the two words mean undertaking in which are joined together' (labour, capital or both).

Duties of partners 

467 

in sales or purchases of various commodities. 805 Bp. (SBE vol. 33 p. 337 verses 5-7) provides that whatever s6 property one partner may give ( or transfer ), being authorised to do so by the rest, or whatever document (or transaction ) he may cause to be executed, all that is to be deemed as done by all partners; the partners themselves are declared to be the judges ( the deciding persons) or witnesses among themselves in a doubtful case and in case of fraud, provided they are not already at feud among themselves. It follows from this that by entering into an agreement of partnership, each partner agrees that he submits to the decision of the other partners in cases of doubt. If any one from them is found out to have practised fraud on the others in sales or purchases he should clear himself by special oaths or ordeals. Yāj. II. 260, Nār. VI. 5,807 Bř. (SBE vol. 33 p. 337 verse 9 ) provide that each partner is responsible to make good what has been lost through his negligence or in consequence of his acting against the instructions of the others or of his acting without their authority or consent. If any one of the partners saves partnership property from act of God or the king or thieves ( or similar calamity ) by his own exertions he is to be awarded (as his special share ) one tenth of the property saved ( Yaj. II. 260, Kāt. 631, 808 Nār. VI. 6). If any partner is crooked or fraudu lent the rest may expel him without giving him any profit; a partner who is incompetent to work (personally ) should get the partnership business done through another ( Yāj. II. 265 ). Yaj. II. 264 and Nār. VI. 7 and 17-18 state that if one partner

goes to a foreign country and dies, his share should be taken by his heirs ( Bon &c.) or by his agnates or cognates ; in default of these the other partners may take it and in default of them the king may take it after waiting for ten years to see whether any heir or claimant turns up. Katyayana 309 states that in the case of artisans who together carry out some work, those among them who are directors of new methods get four shares, those who are adepts in the craft three shares, those who have studied the craft two shares and the apprentices only one share. Whatever is given to strangers by all together (i. e. by the partnership firm ) should be claimed back by the firm as such ; any single partner should not claim it; if he does so he will lose his share of the profit 810. Some rules are prescribed by Br. that among dancers, singers and musicians, the singers get equal shares; while those who beat the tune only get half share each; similarly in the joint construction of a mansion or a temple the head of the artisans gets two shares. An artisan 811 (Silpin) is one who manufactures or works upon gold, silver, yarn, wood, stone and hides or one who has mastered one of the ( 64 ) arts. If a king has ordered a band of adventurers from among his subjects to make a plundering expedition in enemy country, Br. (in V. R. p. 125 ) and Kāt. (633-635 ) 812 prescribe that the king gets one tenth (acc. to Bř.), the leader gets four shares in the remainder, the valiant among his followers three (shares, the more capable two shares and the rest one each and that if any one of them is caught the money for his ransom should be oontributed by all according to their shares. When no agree ment is made as to shares in property by traders, husbandmen, thieves and artisans similar rules apply 813.

Rules about distribution of sacrificial fees 

469 

It is interesting to note that the ancient Dharmasūtras of Gautama, Apastamba and Baudhāyana are silent about partner ships, that Manu (VIII. 206-210 ) lays down rules about the distribution of fees among the priests at a sacrifice and that in one verse ( VIII. 211) he remarks that the same principles are to be applied in all matters where men work conjointly (i. e. each is to be paid according to the importance and voluine of the work he does). The rules about sacrificial priests in Manu are: If a priest chosen to do work in a sacrifice abandons his work a share only of the fee in proportion to the work ( done ) shall be given to him by those conjointly working with him; if a priest leaves after the fees are distributed (as at the time of midday extraction of Soma in the great sacrifices like Jyotiştuma ) then he keeps the whole of it and shall cause the renraining work to be performed by another (who will be paid by the sacrificer, acc. to Medhatithi). When specific fees are prescribed to be paid to individual priests at the performance of the several parts in a complicated sacrifice, the individual priests are to receive them and all are not to participate; as for example, the adhvaryu takes the chariot, the brahmā priest takes the horse in Agnyādhāna, the hotalso takes the horse and the udgātr the cart used in purchasing the soma plant. The four chief priests are entitled to one half of the fees, the first group of their assistants will get half of what the chief ones get, the 2nd group and the fourth . Nār. VI. 10 and Bộ. ( in V, R. p. 120) state that sacrificial priests are of three kinds viz. one hereditary and honoured by the ancestors of the sacrificer, one appointed by the sacrificer himself and one who performs the functions of his own accord through friendship and that (VI. 9 and 11 ) if an officiating priest forsakes a sacrificer who is free from any fault and who has caused no harm or if a sacrificer abandons a priest who is faultless, they both shall be punished but this does not apply to the third kind of priest. Sankha-Likbita, as quoted in V. R. pp. 117 and 120-121 and Sm. C. II. p. 188, give elaborate rules about sacri ficial priests dying or leaving work and the fines to be imposed on them. Kaut. III. 14 lays down rules for the receipt of fees by priests when they leave off at different stages of such solemn sacrifices as the Agnistoma and also when the sacrificer dies without completing the sacrifice. The Vy. Nir. (pp. 284-285 ) quotes a few sentences from Kaut. III. 14. 

The above shows that in the times of the ancient sūtras, secular partnerships had not attained sufficient importance and

even in the times of the Manusmrti almost the same was the case. While Manu extends the rule about the distribution of fees at a sacrifice 814 to secular joint undertakings, Yāj. ( 11. 265 ) extends the general rules about the partnerships of traders to sacrificial priests, husbandmen, craftsmen (like carpenters, dancers &c.). That shows that complicated sacrifices requiring a large number of priests had become rare in Yājñavalkya's days and partnerships of traders and artisans had assumed great importance.

• ardhinah' in the Vedic passages to be quoted below and in Manu VIII. 210 (viz. H GUT, TUPUTS, WET , FIE) receive one-half of 48 (i. e. 24, 6 for each), the next group of four called 'one-thirders' (antra:) in both get 16 (4 to each of TT, A , spate), the last group of four called one-fourth holders' ( \#:) get 12 in all (3 to each of ure , 

org, atg, poo). Vide Mit. on Yaj. II. 265, Kullūka on Manu. VIII. 210, V. R. p. 119, V. P. p. 301. The autre X. 2. 25 says TUTTTH Test Tia: tarxet t ore at: 1. The question of distribution is agitated in Jai. X. 3. 53-55, the prima facie (pūrvapaksa) view being that tbe cows should be equally divided among all the priests or according to the work done, while the conclusion is that since the sruti employs the words अधिनः, तुतीयिनः and पादिनः as if it was a well-known matter (anuvāda), the cows are to be distributed as in Kāt. Ś, sūtra above. The Vedic passage is अध्ययुगृहपति दीक्षयित्वा ब्रह्माणं दीक्षयति तत उदातारं ततो होतारम् । ततस्तं मतिमस्थाता दीक्षयित्वाधिनो दीक्षपति । ... ततस्तं नेष्टा दीक्षपिखा तुतीयिनो दाक्षपीत। ... ततस्तमुजेता दीक्षयिस्वा पादिनो दीक्षयति । 

CHAPTER XIX 

DATTĀNAPAKARMA (resumption of gift). 

This title is also called dattāpradūnika 815 (lit. that which is concerned with the non-delivery or resumption of a gift ). Nār. VII. 1 defines it as that title where a man desires to resume what has been given by him because it has been improperly (in a manner opposed to law ) given by him. Nār. (VII. 2 ) divides this title into four topics viz, what may not be given, what may be given, what are valid gifts and what are invalid gifts, Nār. VII. 3-5 and Br. (SBE vol. 33 p. 342 verse 2) state that there are eight things that cannot be given (adeyu ) viz, an anvāhita, a deposit, yācitaka, a pledge, property jointly owned with others, a deposit, son and wife, the entire property in the case of one who has offspring, and what has been already promised to another. Vide Kauţ. III. 16, Yāj. II. 175 816 for a similar but more com pendious statement, and Kāt. 638. These cannot be given either because they are not one's absolute property or because the gift of them is forbidden by the sages. In the case of even those who hold that one has ownership over one's son or wife, the gift of them is not possible because it is forbidden, just as though one owns rice, yavas and māşı beans, one cannot make offerings of maşa because the veda prohibits their use in the words' ayajñiyā vai māşāḥ'(q. by Sabara on Jai. VI. 3. 20). So son and wife cannot be given on account of the prohibition in the smrtis. The general rule of what may be given is stated 

815. \#UTU on AT. VIII. 214 explains it as por E41974: 44 तत्रामतिषेधः । दानमेवं न चलितं भवति । एषैव दाने स्थितिरिति यावत् । कथं प्रतिभुत्यादीय माने धर्मो न नश्यतीति नैषा शङ्का कर्तव्या। एष एवान धर्मो यम दीयते दत्तं च प्रत्यादीयते । So acc. to this 

\# means "not improper abstraction of what is given or promised to be given.' The her. on T. II. 175 explains both quihanan and T re as follows : 74 39 Thero retaret दसाप्रदानिक नाम भ्यवहारपदम् । ... दत्तस्य अनपाकर्म अपुनरादानं यत्र दानाख्ये विषादपदे HETagen Acc. to this That means that in which what is donated cannot be taken back because the gift is according to law' (also impliedly the converse of it).

( SBE 33 p. 342 verse 3), Kat. 640 viz. whatever is absolutely one's own excepting that required for the maintenance of one's family may be given. 817 Manu (XI. 9-10), Nār. VII. 6 and Br. (quoted in H. of Dh. vol. II pp. 850-851 n. 2007) condemn those who stint their family or servants in order to be charitable to others and say that he who does so would incur sin. Manu XI. p (=Nār. VII. 7), Vas. VIII. 10, Yāj. I. 124, Vişnu Dh. S. 59.8 prescribe that he alone who has property sufficient to provide for three years' mainten ance for those whom he is bound to maintain or has more wealth than that may drink soma i. e. may engage in a soma sacrifice (which costs much ). 

Nār. VII. 8 states that there are seven kinds of dutta gifts, i. e. gifts or transfers that cannot be resumed because they are made by a person in full possession of his faculties and of things that belong to him absolutely and are not forbidden. They are: the price paid for goods bought, wages, what is paid for pleasure (derived from dancing, singing, wrestling ), a gift through affection, a gift made in gratitude, money paid to a bride's kinsmen, and gifts for spiritual or charitable purposes. Acc. to Br. 818 (SBE vol. 33 p. 343 verse 8) there are eight kinds of valid gifts. Nār. VII. 9-11 mentions sixteen kinds of invalid gifts, which have already been set out ( in H. of Dh. vol. II p. 887 where Gaut. V. 22 that specifies some invalid gifts has also been cited). Vide Kāt. 647. The difference between gifts of adeya and adatta gifts is this. In the first class of cases, the gifts being forbidden are entirely null and void, while adatta gifts are those that are voidable and may be set aside by the court on the application of the donor himself, because, of the incapacity of the donor due to intoxication, lunacy, old age, minority, mistake etc. Kāt. 646 and Kaut.

that if a man 819 is in danger of life and promises the gift of all his property to whomsoever may save him, he may resile from the promise and pay only what an expert or arbitrator may award. Kāt. (650-651) defines utkoca (bribe ) 820 as what is obtained in these ways viz. by giving (or threatening to give false) information about a person as a thief or a felon, or as one who breaks the rules of decent conduct, or as an adulterous person, or by pointing out those who are of bad character or by spreading false reports about a person. He further provides that a person offering the bribe should not be fined, but this intermediary may be fined and if the person accepting the bribe has been appointed to an office by the king he should be made to return the bribe and pay a fine eleven times as much to the king. But Kat. adds that where a person not holding a public appointment obtains some gratification for work done, he would not be held guilty and would not have to return what he received as a reward or in gratitude. Hārsta holds out 821 other-worldly evil consequences for not actually delivering what is promised or for resuming what has been already delivered as a gift viz. the person doing so falls into Hell and is born as one of the lower animals and adds that what is promised as a gift for a religious purpose in so many words but is not actually delivered becomes a debt in this world and the next i. e. the king should make the promisor give the

promised gift and should inflict a fine, Kāt. (642) provides 822 that a man who having voluntarily promised a gift to a brahmana does not deliver it should be made to render it as a debt and should be awarded the lowest amercement and further ( verso 566 ) that if a man promises a gift for a religious purpose whether in good health or in disease, his son (or other heir) should be made to pay it if the promisor died without actually delivering it. These verses show that in two cases gifts though not completed by delivery of possession were enforced by ancient Indian courts viz. when the gift was promised to a brāhmaṇa or when the gift was declared to be made for a religious and charitable purpose. The last verse contains the beginnings of the idea of a will, since the mere declaration of the intention of a man to give for a religious purpose is made enforceable after his death against his son or heir. But this germ could not evolve into a full-fledged law of testamentary succession on account of the practice of adoption, the requirement that a gift must be accompanied by present possession and the incidents of the joint family on account of which no single member could alienate family property except for legal necessity and which involved the dootrine that on the death of a member his rights ended and passed by survivorship to other members. Br. expressly states this. 823 But a gift though promised need not be paid or carried out if the promisee turns out to be an irreligious man (Gaut. V. 21 ). Nār. VII. 12 and Br. provide that he who enjoys an invalid gift and he who makes a forbidden gift are both to be punished by the king. 824 

In H. of Dh. vol. II. p. 841 it has been stated that gift consists in the cessation of the ownership of the donor in a thing and creating ownership in another. This latter is effected by accep tance (svikāra) by the donee. Acceptance may be made men tally, vocally or physically.

offering of a dakşiņā to the donee, vide H. of Dh. vol. II. p. 855. Some writers like Jimõtavāhana dispute the statement 825 that acceptance is necessary to constitute a gift. The Dāyabhāga states that by the mere relinquishment of a thing by the donor (i, e. by the activity of the donor himself) the ownership of the thing passes to the person intended as the dones, that the ownership of the other man does not arise by acceptance, that though ownership in the donee does arise by the mere activity of the donor, yet acceptance ( svikāra ) which is an activity of the donee makes the thing donated capable of being disposed off by the donee as he likes on account of his idea 'this is mine'. The Dayabhāga indulges in casuistical reasoning in support of its view, which it is not necessary to get out here. But the remarks of the Dayabhāga are not satisfactory, since it does not adequately explain what is to happen if the intended donee refuses the gift. On its hypothesis ownership has passed to the donee without acceptance being necessary. If the dones refuges, or dies without accepting, who is the owner? Can it be said that the thing becomes the property of whosoever first takes it up and that the donor cannot prevent a third person taking it up? The V. P. pp. 426-428 severely criticizes the Dayabhāga for its views.

VETANASYANAPĀKARMA, ABHYUPETYASUŚRŪSĀ 

AND SVĀMIPĀLAVIVADA (Non-payment of wages, non-rendition of service, dispute 

between master and herdsman ). 

TH 

The question about the payment or non-payment of wagen to those whose services are hired for work is dealt with under this title ( Nār. IX. 1). According to Bp. there 826 are three titles of law in which the question of hiring enters, viz. abhyupetya $usrüşā, vetanasyānapākarma and svūnipülavivāda. Manu and Kauţ. do not treat of the first of these three. Here vetanasya napākurma will be first dealt with, then abhyupetyāśutrūşā and suāmipālavivāda will be separately treated of. All these three topics are concerned with masters and servants or employers and employees. The rules are different according as the contract of service is for a fixed term or for an indefinite period or is for executing a definite piece of work and according as the rate of wages or the hire is fixed beforehand or is not fixed. We have further to remember that the rules are spread over a large period i. e. from about 6th century B. C. to about 500 A. D. (from Gaut. and Āp. to Bř. and Kat. ). The rules deal with the liabilities of both masters and servants. Nar.IX.2 states that the wages agreed upon may be paid at the beginning, in the middle or at the end of the work undertakon, But when no wages are settled beforehand Nār. IX. 3, Yāj. II. 194, Kaut. III. 327 13 provide that the ( agent of a ) trader, the cowherd, the husbandman should receive a tenth part respectively of the profit, of the milk and of the crops. This latter according to the Sm. C. II 

p. 201 holds good where the crops are raised easily. But Br.

Determination of proper wages 

( S. B. E. vol. 33 p. 345 828 verge 13 ) lays down the rule that if the employer supplies food and clothing to the servant, the latter should get a fifth part of the crops (if no wages are settled) or a third part if the servant is given no food nor clothing by the employer: .When no wages are settled Vğddha Manu prescribes that proper wages will be determined by experts in carrying 829 maritime trade (and other traders ) who take into consideration the time, the place and the purpose. Even when the wages were settled the employer could give less or more according to his pleasure in certain cases viz. when a servant or agent acts against the restrictions of time and place prescribed by his employer and consequently the profit is much less, the employer may give less than what is agreed but if the agent brings more profit ( than expected ) he may give more ( Yāj. II. 195). When two or more employees under take to finish a work but cannot finish it (owing to ill-health or similar obstacle ) each of them should be given the wages appropriate to the portion done by each (as settled by an arbitrator), but if the whole work is finished by them the agreed wages must be paid to all of them together (Yāj. II. 196). Yāj. II. 193, Nār. IX, 4 and 830 Bř, state that it is the duty of the employed or servant to take as much care of the utensils supplied by the employer as he would take of his own, and that he should not act in that respect wantonly (or crookedly ) and that if he did so his wages would become less. If a hired servant, after receiving his wages, does not do the work agreed to be done though able to do so, he should be made to repay to the employer the wages received and a fine equal to double of the wages and if he had not received wages but left the work without cause he should be made to pay to the employer

an amount equal to the wages (Yaj. II. 193, Nār. IX. 5, Br. in 831 8. B. E. vol. 33 p. 345 verse 15). Kaut. (III. 14 ) prescribes a fine of 12 papas for a hired servant who does not do the work undertaken even after receiving the wages and that he should be compelled to do the work. Nār. IX, 5 and Kāt. 657 provide that that the king should compel him to do the work and then the agreed wages may be paid to him ; but if he does not do it he should be fined. 832 The fine in such cases aco, to Vṛddha Manu was 200 paņas. Manu VIII. 215 and Bs. (S. B. E. 33 p. 345 verse 16) and Matsya 227.9 provide that a hired servant, who though not ill, does not arrogantly do the work agreed should be fined eight kȚsnalas and would not get wages at all. This applies where a substantial portion is left undone, but where only a little of the work undertaken is left undone then the servant is not to be fined, but he would lose all the wages (Manu VIII. 217 ). But if a servant falls ill, then he may do the work after he becomes well and would get the agreed wages even if a long time may have elapsed (Manu VIII. 216 ). Kaut. ( III. 14 ) also provides that if the servant suffers from illness or is overwhelmed by a calamity, concession may be given to him or he may offer a substitute. The Ap. Dh, S. (II. 11.28. 2-4 ) prescribes that if a husbandman who is not a slave 

but is hired for work) gives up the work or a cowherd acts similarly he should be punished with flogging and the animals handed over to the cowbord should be taken back from him, This may have been the ancient law, but it was modified in later ages. Kaut. (III. 13 ) states that if the employer does not pay the wages he should be fined six panas or a tenth part of the proper wag es or the wages agreed upon and if the hired person denies the receipt of wages (though he really received them ) he should be fined twelve papas or a fifth part of the wages. 833 Kaut. (III. 14 ) further provides that in the contract of service it may be provided that the master is not to employ

Yaj. II. 197, Nār. IX. 9, Kāt. 659, Vigpu Dh. S. 834 V. 155-156 provide that if through the fault of a carrier (and not through act of God or the king) goods entrusted to him for carrying are lost or become deteriorated, he should be made to pay for the loss. Vțddha-Manu specifies that if the goods are lost through the negligence of the servant he has to pay only the price, but if through spite then he should be made to pay double the price. If a hired servant ( such as a palanquin-bearer or an armed guard) causes obstruction (by refusing to work ) at the time of starting for an auspicious matter ( such as a marriage ), he should be made to pay double the amount of the wages agreed upon and another servant may be engaged (Yaj. II. 197, Nār. IX. 8, Kāt. 658, Vļddha-Manu in V. R. P. 163 ). Yaj. II. 198, Nār. IX. 7 provide that if a servant abandons his work ( as a bearer or guard) after a start is made (when not seized by illness ) he should be made to pay 1, 1 or the whole of the wages according to the distance traversed and a master abandoning a servant in similar circumstances should be made to pay similarly. 

If a servant agrees to take a lump sum for some work to be done for a certain period and leaves the work before the period elapses he would lose all the wages, but if he leaves in the middle of the period through the fault of the employer ( such as scolding without any fault of the servant ) he would be entitled to receive a proportionate part of the wages ( Nār. q. by V. R. p. 161 ). 85 Vişnu Dh. S. V. 153-154 and 157-158 provide that in the same circumstances the servant would have to pay a fine

If a trader after engaging a vehicle or draught animals for carrying bis merchandise for bire, does not employ them to carry his goods he should be made to pay a fourth of the hire settled and the whole of it if he discharges them when only a part of the journey has been made (Nār. IX. 7). If the merchandise be attached 836 ( by the king's officers for toll &c.) or be stolen the servant engaged to carry the goods will receive a propor tionate amount (out of the lump sum agreed to be paid for a certain journey ) according to the distance travelled ( Kāt. 661 ) If the employer does not pay the wages of a servant even though the latter has done his work the king should make him pay the wages and also a proper fine (Bộ. in S. B. E. vol. 33 p. 346 verge 18). If a man 837 having hired elephants, horses, bulls, asses or camels does not return them even though the work ( for which he hired them) is finished he should be made to restore them together with the hire (up to the day of return). The same rule applies to a man taking on rent a house or water (reservior) or a market and not giving it up at the time fixed (Kat. 662-663). Nār. (IX, 20-21 ) provides that if a person builds a house on another's land by paying rent ( stoma) for the land, he may take away when vacating the land the bricks, the timber and grass ( thatch) of the house built by him, but if a man builds a house on another's land without paying rent and against the owner's wish then he has to leave

the materials of his house to the owner of the land when he has to give up the land. An important rule is stated by Bṛ. (S. B. E. vol. 33 p. 346 verse 17) that when a servant 838 employ ed by an employer does some improper act (such as a theft) to another for the benefit of his master, the latter would be lield responsible for the loss. The Matsyapurāņa says that if a teacher having agreed to teach a loro or craft for money which he receives fails to do so, he should be fined the whole of the amount 839 of the fee. 

From the above it will be clear that contracts of service and letting on hire are lumped together under ono head by the smrtis. 

Kaut. III. 14 provides that persons may be paid wages by a guild or corporation of workers of which they are members. The earnings of such guilds may be divided equally among all workers or as agreed upon among themselves. Yāj. II. 265 also refers to the fact that rules similar to those of partnerships may apply to guilds of husbandmen and artisans. 

Certain rules are laid down in Nār. IX. 18, Yaj. II. 292 and Matsyapurāņa 227. 144-146 about the monetary liabilities of prostitutes and persons visiting them. Vide H. of Dh. vol. II. pp. 638-39 above. The Matsyapurana (227. 144-146 ) states that a brāhmana who visits a prostitute should be fined as many paņas as he paid to her, that if a prostitute after receiv ing her fee does not receive the visitor and goes elsewhere she should be made to pay to the visitor double of the fee and a similar sum as fine to the king, and that if one, after telling a prostitute that she is to visit a certain person, takes her to a different person, he should be fined one gold māsaka. 

The Matsyapurāņa ( 227.147 ) further states that a visitor who has had sexual intercourse with a prostitute and yet has not paid her fee should be made to pay double the (agreed) fee to her and a similar sum as fine to the king. Nārada provides that the chief prostitutes and the voluptuaries that stay with them

Abhyupetyāśusrūşā (non-rendition of service after making a contract to serve or obey ) 841. Nār. VIII. 1 defines it as the title in which after having undertaken to serve or obey one does not act up to it. The ancient dharmasūtras mention only two kinds of servants viz. agricultural labourers and herdsmen, Vide Ap. Dh, S. II. 11.28. 2-3 and Gaut. XIL 16-17 842. Acc. to Nār. VIII. % and 3 there are five kinds of servers (or atten. dants ) viz. four that are called kar makara (performers of labour ) and the fifth class comprehends slaves of fifteen kinds ; and the four karmakaras are pupil (sişya), apprentice (antevāsin), a hired servant (bhrtaka) and one who supervises hired servants (adhikarmakrt). Not being free to do as they like is the common attribute of these five kinds of attendants, but there is a distinction among them due to their castes, their peculiar actions and their mode of maintaining themselves (Nār. VIII. 4). A sisya (pupil) is one who desires (from his teacher) instruc tion in Vedic learning, an antevāsin is one who receives instruc tion in some craft such as goldsmith's work or dancing, a hired servant is one that does some work for wages, an adhikarmakrt is one who supervises hired servants. Work is of two kinds, $ubha (i. e, pure, done by the four kinds of karmakaras ) and adubha i. e, impure ( done only by slaves ). Aśubha acts com prise 443 (Nār. VIII. 6-7 and Kāt. 720) sweeping the doors of houses, pits in which leavings of food are thrown, roads, rubbish heaps; scratching or shampooing the private parts (of the masters ); collecting and throwing away leavings of food, ordure and urine and making use of one's limbs (hand &c.) at the master's desire for wiping off the master's private parts; all other actions are pure. Karmakaras do work for securing Vedio learning or vijñāna ( art or craft ), some desire or money. The

Duties of karmakaras 

483 

duties of a vedic student are described by Nār. VIII. 8-15 and have been set out above in H. of Dh, vol. II. pp. 305-312 viz. to wait upon the teacher, his wife and son, to beg for food, to sleep on the ground, to do the bidding of the teacher, to learn the vedas, to offer fee to the teacher at the end of vedic study. An apprentice is distinguished in his actions and mode of maintenance from a sişya. The antevāsin, acc. to Yāj. II. 184, Nār. VIII. 16-21, Br. (S. B. E, vol. 33 p. 344 verse 6 ) and Kāt. 713, resides with a master craftsman to learn some 844 art or craft (such as goldsmith's work, singing, dancing, house building ), agreeing to work under him for a stated period, the master craftsman gives him food and teaches him in his own house, does not put him to any other work; if the apprentice leaves the teacher even though the latter is willing to teach him, he ( the pupil) should be made to stay with the teacher and may be whipped or confined; the pupil even though he may have become an adept has to stay with the master till the end of the agreed period and the teacher appropriates the fruits of the apprentice's labour. If the master does not instruct the appren tice in the craft and makes him do other work, he would be liable to pay the first amercement and the pupil may leave him 845 

Hired servants have different grades among them arising from the work they do, the wages they receive and the period for which they are employed and they are distinguished from apprentices in these respects and not as regards caste or mode of maintenance. According to Nār. VIII. 22-23 and Bf. (S. B. E. vol. 33, p. 344 verse 8) a hired servant is of three kinds and his wages depend on the work he does and his ability to do it. The three kinds are the highest (viz. a soldier ), middling (an agriculturist), the lowest 846 ( a porter). A hired servant may

A person who is employed and given authority over all servants and also one who looks to the affairs ( expenditure &c.) of the household is called ' adhikarmakrta ( or-krt), acc. to Nār. VIII. 24. All these four are called workers in clean occupa. tions, while the fifteen kinds of slaves are employed in the lowest and dirtiest work (Nār. VIII. 25). The difference between the hired servants and slaves is this that the latter surrender all their freedom and themselves entirely to another, while the former, though dependent to some extent, do retain some freedom (Kāt. 715), but a brāhmaṇa was not to be a slave 848 In very ancient times the master's liability for the acts of his servant does not seem to have been recognized. For example, Gaut. XII. 17 states that if cattle entrusted to a herdsman cause loss to crops, then the herdsman is to be held responsible (and not the owner who employs the herdsman ). But Manu VIII. 243, Yāj. II. 161, Nār. XIV. 29 appear to hold the master liable to make good the loss caused by the herdsman's default. Vide Bṛ. quoted above under vetanasiū napīkarma. 

The kinds of slaves and the incidents of slavery have been already dealt with in H. of Dh, vol. II. pp. 180-189. A few matters not referred to there may be dealt with here. ' Buddhist India' p. 55 (by Rhys Davids ) shows how slavery in the Buddhist period was not as miserable as under the Greeks. The Rājatarangipi IV. 39 states that king Vajrāditya of Kashmir (in the 8th Century A. D.) sold many men as slaves to Mlecchas. One cannot help blaming the British Indian Govern ment for the Assam Labour and Emigration Act ( VI of 1901 ) whereby a modified form of serfdom or slavery was legalised for the benefit of the tea planters of Assam, Bengal and other provinces and by sections 168–169 of which poor indentured labourers who were induced to labour on the sumptuous monthly wages of five rupees were liable to be sentenced to fine or in

default to imprisonment, if they left off the work to which by agreement they were tied down in unhealthy districts and unhealthier surroundings. 

Kāt. (725 ) provides that 819 if a woman who is not a slave marries a slave she becomes a slave since her husband is her lord and is dependent on his master. If a person buys or sells a brāhmaṇa woman 850 as a slave the king should annul that transaction and all persons ( concerned in it) should be fined by him and the same holds good in the case of a woman of a respectable family who took shelter with a person and was made a slave by him or transferred by him to another as a 

slave (Kāt. 726–727). The punishment of first amercement is prescribed for a person who has sexual intercourse with the nurse of his child or with another woman who is not a slave and the wife of his attendant as if she were a slave; and a fine of two hundred paņas is provided in case a master who is not in difficulties and is well-off desires to sell a female slave who is faithful and weeps bitterly (being unwilling to leave him). Nār. VIII. 40 provides that if a slave leaves his master and goes over to another saying 'I am your slave' that would not help the slave, as his former owner would be entitled to claim him back. Ušanas states 851 that a guru ( elderly person), a sapinda, a brāhmaṇa and persons of the lowest castes (capdalas &c.) cannot be made slaves, nor can any one of the higher castes who is superior in learning be the slave of one of the same caste.

TT 

SAMVID-VYATIKRAMA AND OTHER TITLES 

( Violation of compacts or conventions) 

Nār. ( XIII. 1 ) employs the expression samayasyānapākarma. Manu VIII. 5 employs the first expression. Manu (VIII. 218-219) has both names in view, when he says 'I shall now declare the rules applicable to those who violate samayas (conventions ). He who having entered into a compact (samvid) under (the sanction of) an oath with the inhabitants of a village or a district or with a group of traders or other persons breaks it through greed should be banished from the kingdom by the king.' In Ap. Dh. S. I. 1. 1.2 and II. 4, 8. 13 the word 

samaya ' 852 is employed in the sense of 'convention or accept od doctrine'. The same word is also used in the sense of 'agreement' as in Yaj. I. 61 ( gāndharvaḥ samayānmithaḥ). In this title it means the acceptance of a certain rule or convent ion arrived at by many', as explained by 853 Medhātithi on Manu VIII. 219. It signifies a local or caste usage or convent ion made by groups of people ( such as guilds and corporations ) binding on all members that form or join the several groups. The Amarakosa holds that ācāra and sarvid are among the several meanings of samaya. Medhātithi explains that, if the inhabitants of a village come to a decision that they would oppose the inhabitants of a neighbouring village who were indulging in grazing their cattle in the pastures of the former village or diverting the watercourses and that if in doing so there was a riot or a suit were filed before the king, all should

be of one mind, that any one of those who encouraged this decision would be liable to be punished if he backed out of it through some inducement offered by the headman of the other village. Nār. XIII. 1 explains that samaya means the rules (or conventions ) settled among heretics, naiyamas 854 and the like. Yaj. II. 192 and Nar. XIII. 2 provide that the conventions of guilds, naigamas, heretics, srenis, pigas, ganas and in towns and districts should be enforced by the king and their traditional mode of conducting their business should be protected. Some remarks have already been made on guilds and corporations above (pp.156-57 notes 196-198). Vide also H. of Dh. vol. II. pp. 66-69 for the guilds and corporations and the meanings of words like $reni, pūga, gana eto. Some further informa tion is added here. The Sm. C. (II. p. 223) has a very 855 interes ting note illustrating the various conventions of several groups and its remarks are copied verbatim by the V. P. pp. 332-333. It says: 'Even heretics have certain rules made for the benefit of their monasteries. Among naigamas there is a practice that those who disregard messages brought by servants wearing a specific jacket (as a uniform) should be fined. Srenis are guilds of craftsmen such as weavers. They have rules that certain articles are to be sold only by a certain guild and by no other. Pūgas are groups of elephant riders and horse riders.' Vrāta is defined by Kāt. as a body of persons armed with various weapons, while the Mahabhasya on Panini V.2.21 (uratena jivati) explains it as a group of men of several castes and several occupations who make a living by relying on their formidable bodies'. Acc. to the Mit. heretics are those like the Bauddhas who do not regard the Veda as authoritative, Gapa means, acc.

But this sense is not appropriate here. The same work (p. 14) quotes कात्यायनाs definition which is more appropriate 'नानापौरसमाज नेगमाख्यः प्रकीर्तितः।।

to Mit. an assemblage of armed persons subsisting by follow ing one occupation', while Kāt. (680) says it is a corporation of brahmanas. In the Rajat. II. 132 reference is made to corpora tions of purohitas at temples and tirthas ( sacred places ). The Sm. C. states that among pūgas and vrātas there is a convention that they must go to battle all together and not separately. Among ganas there is a usage that the lobes of the ear (of a child) are to be pierced on the 5th day or in the fifth year from birth. Among mahājanas in a settlement of brāhmaṇas there is a convention that a brāhmaṇa repairing to them for collecting fees to be paid to his teacher (at the close of Vedic study ) should be honoured (i. e, should be paid some contribution). In certain districts there is a usage that either the seller or the buyer should keep in his hand it of the price (probably for finding out whether the article is useful for the purpose in hand and resiling from the bargain if it is not ). In forts or capitals there is a rule that corn taken out of it by a person with him when going out elsewhere should not be sold by him. In villages there is a rule that in pastures no digging would be allowed. In the hamlets inhabited by abhiras there is a convention that for adultery by a male or female there is to be no fine. It does credit to the ancient writers on dharmaśāstra that they were tolerant enough to require the king, whatever his own religious persuasion might be, to honour and enforce the usages of even herstice among themselves. The only requirement was that the enforcement of their usages must not be opposed to the interest of the country or the capital and must not cause commotion and must not be plainly immoral 856 (Nār, XIII. 4-5 and 7 and Medhatithi on Manu VIII. 220). Yāj. (II. 188–192 ) lays down the following rules : there should be a committee of two, three or five, acc. to Bř. ) 857 to look after the business of the guilds &c. ( called kāryacintaka ) who should be religious, pure, not covetous and all members should carry out what they decide upon; when the committee members approach the king on some business of their guild he should bestow on them gifts and

honour them. Whatever is obtained by any one sent on the business of the group must be handed over by him to the heads of the group ( also Bř. in 8. B. E. vol. 33 p. 349 verse 22 ) 858 and if he does not do so he should be fined eleven times as much, Whoever goes against the heads of the group that are working for its benefit should be punished in the first amercement ( by the group itself, acc. to Sm. C. II. p. 224). Kat. (677) states the general rule that whatever is obtained (by the committee or advisers of the group ) or is saved by them or whatever debts are incurred by them for their group and whatever they obtain through the king's favour should be shared equally by all (members of the group). Kat. ( 674-675 ) provides that whatever debt was professedly incurred by the committee for the group but was misappropriated by them or applied to their individual purposes must be paid by them and that those who subsequently join the groups already formed become equally entitled to the property and liable for the debts previously acquired or incurred. Manu VIII. 220 and Br. (S. B, E. vol. 33 p. 348 v. 14 ) provide a fine of six nişkas of four suvarpas each (or six nişkas and four suvarnan) for him who falls out with his associates. Kat. (671) provides that that member of a group) who opposes what is reasonable, who gives no soope to (i. e. obstructs or persistently interrupts ) a speaker (in a meeting of the group ) or who speaks absurdly should be made to pay the first amercement. Yāj. II. 187 prescribes forfeiture of all property and banishment for him who misappropriates the property of the group or corporation or who violates the conventions made by the group (or the king ). As stated by the Mit, this and other sentences depended upon the nature and gravity of the offence and the capacity of the offender 859 

Krayavikrayānusaya (repentance after purchase or sale ). Manu VIII. 222 and Kaut. II. 15 regard this as one title of law. But Nār. (XI and XII ) splits this into two titles viz. vikriyāsampradana (non-delivery of a thing after it is sold for a price ) and bitvārusaya (repentance after buying). Manu states the general rule that whenever a person after buying

or selling anything repents of having done so, be inay return or take back that thing within ten days. Nār. XI. 2 states that property is of two kinds in this world viz. movable and immovable and that all property is designated as panya (saleable ) in rules about purchase and sale. According to Yaj. 11. 254, Nār. XI. 4-5, Vişņu Dh, S. V. 127 860), if a man sells property and does not deliver it to the purchager, he should be made to deliver it to the parchaser together with profits (between the time of sale and delivery ) and if it is movable together with the price of profits arising 8 from it ( such as milk in the case of a cow). Vigņu Dh. S. V. 128 prescribes a fine of 100 panas against the vendor. Kaut. III. 15 prescribes a fine of 12 paņas against the vendor who after selling a thing does not deliver it and also against a buyer who having pur chased does not take delivery of it, except when the thing itself is detective or is lost by act of king or theft or by fire or flood or unless the transaction was for inadequate price or brought about in distress. 862 If the article sold is not deliver ed by the vendor after demand by the vendee and it is injured, destroyed by fire or stolen, the loss will fall on the vendor (Nar. XI. 6, Vişnu Dh. 8. V. 129, Yāj. II. 256 ). These rules apply when the vendor does not feel repentance for having sold the thing, but if he feels repentance then Manu VIII. 222 will apply and the vendor may pay back the price and recover the article within ten days 863 from the sale. Kāt. (684) provides the same rule. No one, either buyer or vendor, can rescind the sale after ten days and if any one uses force in

recovering the article sold or bought after that period the king should fine him 600 panas. Manu VII. 228 extends these rules about repentance and recovery within ten days to all transactions whatever. Kāt. ( 685 ) prescribes that the period of ten days for repentance is allowed to vendors and vendees only in the case of land, and that the period is 12 days when the parties to sale of land are sapiņdas of one another and that in other cases the period is even shorter. 864 Yāj. II. 257, Nār. XI. 7-8, Bř. (8. B. E. vol. 33 p. 350 verse 4) provide that when a vendor having sold a thing to one man for a price received sells it to another or having concealed the defects of an article sells it as free from defects he should be made to return double the price to the purchaser and a fine equal to double the price to the king. $65 The above rules apply where the purchaser has paid the price, but if there is a mere agree ment and no price is paid, then the vendor or vendee is guilty of no wrong if he resiles from the bare agreement to sell or buy unless they have made an express stipulation that the agree ment cannot be rescinded (Nār. XI. 10). When at the time of the agreement for sale, the vendee pays something by way of ear pest, then if the sale goes off through the fault of the vendor, the latter has to return to the vendee double of the earnest; 866 but if the purchaser does not finally take it he loses the thing and also the earnest. Nār. XII. 1 prescribes that when a vendee after having purchased a thing for a price repents of the pur chase that is the title of law called 'rescission of purchase.' Nār. XII. 2 prescribes that if the purchaser thinks that he has made a bad bargain he may return the thing purchased to the vendor on the same day in an undamaged condition (and may receive back the price paid); but if he returns it on the 2nd or 3rd day after the purchase (including the day of purchase ) he will have to lose respectively one-thirtieth or one-fifteenth of the price and after the third day he cannot return the thing at all (Nār. XII. 3), But Yaj. II. 177 and Nār. XII. 5-6 lay down

the following periods for examination of things purchased, viz. one, three, five, seven, ten days, half a month and one month respectively in the case of iron (and clothes), milch cattle, beasts of burden, jewels (precious stones, pearls and corals), all Borts of grain, a male slave and a female slave. It must be supposed that these verses contain exceptions to the general rule in Manu VIII. 22% cited above. Kaut. (III. 15) allows only one night, three nights, five nights and seven nights for repentance to traders, husbandmen, cowherds, the mixed castes and higher castes and provides that where the articles sold are perishable a very short time only may be allowed. The above rules apply only when the purchaser made no examination at the time of purchase. Nār. 867 XII. 4 and Bṛ. (S. B. E. vol. 33 p. 350 verse 3) recommend that a purchaser should himself closely examine an article before buying it and also show it to others in order to find out its defects and good qualities and provide that when he has approved of an article after close examination he cannot return it to the vendor. Vyāga provides that hides, fuel, bricks, yarn, grain, intoxicants, fluids, gold, inferior metals (like lead and tin) and other wealth should be carefully examined then and there i. e. when once bought after close examination none of these can be returned even if some defect 868 is found therein. Nār. (XII, 5-6) cited above contains exceptions to this. Nār. XII. 7 gives an example of a purchase being not liable to be rescinded when & defective article is purchased with open eyes viz. a worn garment which is soiled with dirt and is in ragged condition cannot be returned to the vendor if it was in that state at the time of the purchase i. e. the maxim'caveat emptor' applies. If a purchaser does not take delivery of the thing sold to him, the vendor may sell it again to another 869 and if the thing is lost through aot of God or the king the loss falls on the buyer alone (Yaj. II. 255, Nār. XL. 9). Kat. (692) pro vides 870 that what has been sold by a lunatic or an intoxicated

person or through intimidation or for an inadequate price or by. one who is dependent or by an idiot should be relinquished by the purchaser; it still belongs to the seller. Kāt. (705–706) lays down a novel rule to find out what is adequate or inade quate price. What a71 is decided by the neighbours assembled together, who know (the land &o. and its value) and who are afraid of committing sin, as the price of fields, gardens, houses and the like, of bipeds and quadrupeds, is declared to be the proper price; a price which is less or more than it by one-eighth is declared to be improper; what is sold for an improper price may be annulled even after a hundred years. Kat. (704) states that when the owner of a field absconds to gether with the surety 872 for the payment of the land tax, the judges of the court may order a sale for recovery of the tax and that such a sale may be set aside up to ten years and a com promise or exchange up to three generations, if it is inequitable. Bhāradvāja provides that when taxes are not paid both by the tax-payer and his surety even when called upon to do so, then the king may order a charge on the land or sale of the land. 

Uktalābha is defined as a conditional sale, where a man borrows only a portion of the proper price of a land and stipulates that he would return the money on a certain day and that if he did not do so his ownership over the land would come to an end. 873 Kāt. (711) adds that a sale of the uktalābha kind will be valid if it is for more than half ( the proper price of the land ), provided more than ten years have elapsed (after

Kat: (71%) further 875 prescribes that the unpaid purchase money carries compound interest after demand if no time is fixed for payment, but, if a time is fixed, then only the balance has to be paid up to the end of that period. Bp. provides that in all sales, the sale deed should mention the wells and trees (on the land), the water and ways and that the crops, trees and fruits, wells, tanks and house standing on the land sold would belong to the vendor if they are not put down in the deed of sale, 876 According to Harita the rules of sales are to be extended to exchanges. 877 

From the Rājatarangini VI. 41 it appears that a fraudulent purchaser, who, by means of the heavy bribe of 1000 dinārus, induced the officially authorized scribe to include a well in the sale of a house when it was intended to be excluded from it, was banished from the country by the king, his property being confiscated and given over to the cheated vendor.

Definitions of sale, exchange &c. 

495 

The Vyavahāranirpaya, after quoting Bộ. and Vyāsa, very lucidly explains what is meant by sale, purchase, exchange &o. Gold and the like which a man desires to render or pay is called price, while land, house and the like are said to be 'panya' (saleable thing ). Purchage means acoeptance of a thing pre coded by the offering of a price (either paid or agreed to be paid); sale is the acceptance of a price preceded by the offering of a saleable thing. Parivștti or parivartana is the acceptance of an article for an article of the same kind; if there is a disparity in value between the two articles exchanged the exchange is called ' rwvakraya '; when there is an exchange of two articles of different kinds but of the same value it is called vininaya. 878 The Vyavahāranirņaya makes elaborate provi sions for sale of land at the order of the king for non-payment of land tax. It quotes Prajapati (p. 350 ) to the effect that the purchaser at such a sale must offer half or at least one-fourth of the real price of the field and that the original owner could get back his property sold for the royal dues by paying the full price to the purchaser up to three generations. Other elaborate rules on the same subject are passed over here for reasons of space. These provisions indicate that ownership in cultivated fields belonged to individuals and that the State had only the right to levy taxes. Vide H. of Dh, vol. II. pp. 865-869 and Kāt, quoted above ( on p. 196 ) for a discussion of the theory of the State's ownership of all lands. Taking into consideration the Pūrvamimāṁsā texts, the Vyavahāramayûkha and the verses of Kāt, and others it appears that the State was deemed to be the owner of all lands as a general proposition, but that where individuals or bodies of persons had been in long possession of lands that they cultivated, the ownership of the State was qualified and restricted only to the recovery of a tax or share

of crops and that individuals and groups that had cultivated lands in their possession were regarded practically as owners of the land subject to the liability to pay land tax and to the right of the State to sell the land for non-payment of tax. The Vyavahāranirnaya quotes Bp. and another smrti text that sūdras, persons excommunicated for grave sins (patita), cāndālas and desperate characters cannot be allowed to possess the lands of a brābmaņa by sale, partition or in lieu of wages; 879 the same work further quotes Vyāsa, Bhāradvāja and Br. that when land is sold there is a right of pre-emption in favour of full brothers, sapiņdas, samanodakas, sagotras, neighbours, creditors and one's co-villagers in order. 880 

Gifts of immovables were looked upon in very ancient times with disfavour, though they were made even in the times of the Upanişads. Vide H, of Dh. vol. II pp. 740-41. But sales of land must have been rarer still in ancient times owing to the patriarchal and joint family systems. The Mit. on Yaj. II. 114 quotes a verse forbidding the sale of immovable property : 881 but sales of lands are mentioned in many copperplate grants. Vide Paharpur plate grant of Gupta year 159 i. e. 478-79 A. D. in E. I vol. 20 p. 59 (where one kulgāvāpa of land is stated to have been sold for two dināras to a brāhmaṇa and his wife named Rāmi by the city council for the provision of the worship with sandal-wood paste &o. of the divine arhats at a vihāra), E. I. vol. 17 p. 345 (grant of the time of Kumāra gupta I in Gupta year 113), the Damodarpur plates ( E. I. vol. 15 p. 113), Faridpur plates (Ind. Ant. vol. 39 p. 193), E. I. vol. 18 p. 74. From these records of the 5th and 6th centuries A. D. it appears that land was owned by private individuals or by

joint families or by the village community or by the king and there was a fixed procedure when land was to be sold, that the purchaser approached the District Officers who consulted the pustapālas that kept a record of titles and that the villa gers and headmen were consulted and asked to mark off the land to be sold. It appears that the smştis recommended that sales should be clothed in the formalities of gifts, probably because gifts were frequent and sales were not. A smrti quoted by the Mit. (on Yaj. II. 114) states land passes (i. e. is trans ferred) with the assent of the villagers, the agnatic relations, the neighbours, the co-sharers and with the offering of gold and water.' The Mit. explains that these 882 are not absolutely neces sary formalities of a sale, but that they are recommended for the sake of greater caution and convenience, that the absent of the villagers is to be secured for the publication of the transaction of sale, as a text says that acceptance, particularly of im movables, should be made openly, that the neighbours' assent should be secured for preventing boundary disputes, that the assent of agnates and co-sharers is desired for making it easy to complete the transaction, that it does not follow that without the assent of these the sale of land is not valid or complete. Water and gold are to be offered because gifts being highly commended, a sale should be clothed outwardly with the same formalities. Vide Dr. P. N. Sen's 'Hindu Jurisprudence' pp. 76–78 for the opposite procedure of the ancient Roman Law that gifts were to be clothed with the formalities of sale. For water and gold in the case of gifts vide above under dattāpradānika. 

Svāmipalavivāda (disputes between the owner of cattle and herdsman who is engaged to look after them). In ancient times this must have been a prominent source of litigation in a predominantly agricultural country like India, Nār. appears to have included this title under vetanasyānapā. karma. Yāj. II. 164, Nār. IX. 11 provide that the cowherd has to bring back to the owner in the evening the cows (and other domestic animals ) handed over to him in the morning by

the owner, after grazing them in the pastures and making them drink water. Manu VIII. 230 says that during the day the responsibility for the safety of the cattle rests on the herdsman and during the night on the owner provided they are in the latter's house. When there is no express agreement as to wages Nār. IX, 10 and Bs. (S. B. E. 33 p. 346 verse 19 ) prescribe that a cowherd 883 will get as his wages all the milk of the cows tended by him on every eighth day plus a heifer (two years old) every year out of every one hundred cows tended by him or a milch cow with her calf every year for every two hundred cows looked after by him. Manu VIII. 231 provides another method when no wages are fixed by agreement viz. a hired herdsman, who is paid with milk, may milk as hire the best cow out of ten with the consent of the owner. It is the duty of the cowherd to struggle as much as in him lies to protect the cows from accidents and if he is unable to do so he must quickly inform the owner (Nār. IX. 12). Bộ. (S. B. E. 33 p. 346 verge 20) states 884 that the cowherd shall save cattle from the danger of worms (or reptiles), robbers, tigers and from caverns and pits and that he should try to protect them to the best of his ability, should call out for help or inform his master. If the herdsman does not struggle to protect the cows, nor raise a hue and cry nor inform his master he must make good the value of the cow lost and must pay a fine to the king (Nār. IX. 13). Manu VIII. 232 and 235, Yaj. II. 164-165, Visnu Dh. S. V. 885 137-138, Nār. (IX, 14-15) provide that if a cow or other domestic animal strays or is killed by worms (or reptiles) or slain by dogs (and wild animals) or dies by falling into a pit or by any negligent act of the herdsman, he himself shall make good the loss, if he did not exert bimself to prevent this happening or if goats and sheep are surrounded by wolves and carried away while the herdsman does not hasten to their help he shall bear the res ponsibility for the loss. In these cases the herdsman has also

to pay a fine of 123 panas 38 to the king (Yaj. II. 165). Ap. Dh. S. II. 11. 28. 6 makes 887 the herdsman liable to pay the price if an animal in his charge dies or is lost (by theft &c.). Manu VIII. 233, 236, Nār. IX. 16, Vyāsa state exceptions to the above viz. where an animal is carried away 888 by robbers though the herdsman raised a cry, he would not be liable to make good the loss provided he gave information to his master at the proper time (immediately after the animal is carried away) and proper place; or when the herdsman himself is seized or the village is attacked or the country is invaded, the herdsman would not be liable for loss or seizure of any animal under his charge; and also where, while the herd is grazing in a proper order near a forest, a wolf suddenly kills an animal. Manu VIII. 234, Nār. IX. 17 state that when cattle die through act of God or king or die without any fault of kis while in charge of a herdsman, he has to free himself from liability or from the suspicion of himself having 859 carried away surreptitiously the animal by producing before his master their ears, skin, tails, bladders, tendons and yellow bile or by showing their limbs (viz, their characteristic marks). Vyāsa states that if a herdsman, who has received his wages, abandons cattle in an untenanted forest and moves about in the village he should be fined by the king.89

that on all sides round a village, a kharvata and a town an uncultivated space for pastures (between it and the fields) shall be kept respectively of 100, 200, 400 dhanu: 591 in extent. Kāt. (666) prescribes that the owner of a field (which is near a forest) should construct a high paling before the crops have grown; for animals (or deer) when they have once tasted the sweet 892 ( crops ) can be warded off with difficulty. Manu VIII, 239 = ( Matsya 227.25), Nār. XIV. 41 prescribe that a hedge should be constructed for a field that is near a public way so high that a camel cannot look inside over it or a borge or cattle cannot jump over or so thick that & dog or boar should not be able to thrust its head inside it through holes. Manu VIIL 238 ( = Matsyapurāna 227. 26 ), Yaj. II. 162, Nār. XIV. 40 provide that if a field situated near a village or a pasture or near a public road is not protected by a hedge and cattle straying into it cause loss, the herdsman is not to be held guilty. It is provided by Ap. Dh. S. 11. 11. 28. 5, Manu VIII. 240, Nar. XIV. 28, Kāt. 664-665 that if cattle enter into fields, 893 parks or pastures that are situated near a village or a publio road and are enclosed by a hedge, they may be seized or beaten off, the herdsman is to be fined (a hundred paņas ). Yaj. II. 159-161, Manu VIII. 241, Nār. XIV. 28-29, Kāt, 667 and others lay down that where cattle enter fields ( not near a village or road) and cause loss, the herdsman is to be fined or whipped, the owner of the cattle is to make good the loss and

Ap. Dh, S. 1. 3. 9. 6 and 23 employ the expression TUTATE for stating distance. 1947 means yoke-pia (gu ). Vide p. 145 note 185 above for dhanus and other measures of distance. In E. I. vol.

Fines for cattle straying among crops 

501 

pay the fine prescribed and the fines vary 8. g. Ya. II. 159 prescribes fines of 2, 4 and 8 māşas respectively when a goat or a cow or a she-buffalo strays and causes logs of crops, while Kat. (667) prescribes only pana in the case of cows and sheep and ; in the case of she-buffaloes. Vide Gaut. XII. 19-22 and Kaut. III. 10 also. Those who purposely set cattle to eat or destroy crops were to be punished as thieves (Nār. XIV. 34). 

Ancient India entertained tender feelings for certain animals and in certain circumstances. Nār. XIV. 30, Yāj. II. 163, Manu VIII. 242, Kaut. III. 10 894 and Ušanas provide that cows within ten days after calving, a stud bull, a horse, an elephant, animals let loose in honour of ancestors or deities, and cattle that have strayed from the herd or that have no herdsman to look after them and have met with an accident are to be warded off when causing harm to crops, but the owner is not to be fined. Usanas 895 states that the reason for this leniency is that horses and elephants are protectors of people. Apararka (p. 771 ) explains that this exemption applies only to the king's horses and elephants. Ušanas adds that (owners of) cows should not be fined when they cause some loss at the time of festivals and brāddhas. The great veneration for cows led Uśanas to lay down that he who requires the owner of a cow to re-imburse the loss of crops that are eaten up or destroyed by a cow will find that his pit?s and the gods do not receive the offerings made 896 by him. This is explained by the Par. M. III. p. 385 as referring to crops in fields near a village not enclosed by a hedge and by the Madanaratna to crops eaten at the time of śrāddha. Br., Yāj. II. 161 and Nār. XIV. 38 require the owner of the cow to re-imburse the owner of the crops for the loss as settled by the neighbours. Vide under 'steya' for cases in which there is no offence of theft even if a person takes certain things belonging to another without his permission.

SĪMAVIVĀDA ( boundary disputes ). 

This is called kşetra javivāda 897 (disputes relating to fields ) by Nārada XIV. 1, who defines it as ' dispute with regard to land in which questions about dikes or embankments, the boundaries of fields, ploughed land and fallow land have to be decided.' Nārada's idea appears to be that the word 'simavivāda' in Manu is only illustrative and is a compendious way of mentioning disputes about land in general. According to Kāt. (732) there are six causes 89 of land disputes viz. claiming more land, claim that a person is entitled to less than he possesses, claim to a share, denial of a share, seizing possession when previously there was none, boundary. In all these cases boundaries have directly or indirectly to be settled and there fore all these are included under the topic of simāvivāda. A boundary dispute may relate to the boundaries of a distriot (janapada ), a village, a field and a house. Boundaries, acc. to Nār., may be of five kinds.899 They are described as follows: dvhanni is what is indicated by trees which are like a flag staff. Manu (VII. 246-247) prescribes that trees such as asvattha, the silk cotton, śāla, tāla (palmyra palm ), that have milky juice (like udumbara ) should be planted to indicate boundaries and also bamboo clumps, bushes, reeds &c. A matsyini (lit. having fish) boundary is provided by rivers flowing naturally and full of fish and tortoises or by tanks and reservoirs of water (Manu VIII. 248). A naidhāni boundary is one indicated by concealed signs (just as nidhāna i. e. treasure is concealed in the earth), such as pots filled with chaff, coal, bricks, bones and similar things that the earth does not corrode

Five kinds of boundaries

and are buried inside the earth. Manu (VIII. 250-251 ) enume rates those objects that should be buried in the earth, which would serve to indicate the boundaries of a village or field and which are therefore called concealed (upacchanna) by him. A blayavarjitā (free from .danger) boundary is settled by the agreement of the parties. The fifth kind is the one that is laid down by order of the king. Br. (S. B. E. 33 p. 351 verse 2) prescribes 900 that at the time of founding a village definite boundaries should be erected or constructed by means of visible or patent (prakāśı) and concealed (upāmāu or upacchanna ) signs and the Sm. C. II. 228 explains that a row of big stones should be employed to indicate the boundary. Bṛhaspati (S. B. E. vol. 33 p. 351 verses 3-7) states what patent and concealed boundary marks should be and requires elderly persons to point them out to youths and children who in their turn when old are to point out the boundaries to other youths and in this way traditional knowledge of boundaries may be kept up. Manu (VIIL 252-253) states that in disputes boundaries should be settled in accordance with the visible and concealed signs des cribed above, by reliance on long former enjoyment and by the constant flow of water and that if there be doubt even after observing the signs then the dispute has to be decided on the evi. dence of witnesses. Witnesses could either depose to the marks of boundaries or to the boundaries themselves. Those who could not point out the marks but were to define the boundaries themselves were to follow a certain procedure. Manu VIII. 254 states that the witnesses should be asked about the marks of boundaries in the presence of the litigating parties and groups (or faniilies) of the villagers. The witnesses on being asked were to trace, point out and settle the boundary unani mously, being clad in red garments, wearing red chaplets and being exhorted to depose truly by their spiritual merit 90 and carrying clods of earth on their heads, by reference to mounds or depressions, coals, bones and chaff (buried underground,

in a vessel ), embankments, anthills, platforms of stones or bricks (Manu VIII. 255, 256, Yaj. II. 151, Nar. XIV. 4-6). Vas. 16. 13, Kaut. III 9, Yaj. II. 150, Manu VIII. 258,260, Nar. (XIV.2-3) prescribe that on failure of witnesses of the adjoining villages, neighbours (samanta),92 old men, cowherds husbandmen who plough the fields near the one in dispute, hunters, fowlers, fishermen, snake catchers and foresters should settle the disputed boundary in the presence of the king. The 

Mit. on Yaj.03 II. 153 quotes Kat. (743-745, 51) to show that witnesses were divided into sūmanta, maula, vrddha and uddhrta, each preceding group being superior to the succeeding. The Mit. further says that the neighbours as witnesses are to be arranged in the form of the layers of the petals of a lotus viz. the nearest ones ( sařsaktaka ) are those most preferred, ( but if this group has faults ) then a second but a more removed group and then a third group still more remote may be examined. Sankha-Likhita and Vas.904 16.13-15 prescribe that in boundary disputes the decision depends on neighbours, in the case of conflict of witnesses on documents and then on the old men in the town or village and the guilds. Yaj. II. 152 and Manu VIII 258 require that the neighbours who are to settle the boundary should be four, eight or ten ( even in number) and inhabitants of the same village (if possible), Br. (S. B.E. 33 p. 352 Verse 14 ) requires that the witnesses 905 should know the source of title (to the disputed land), the measurement (in nivartanas, dandas &c.), the length of enjoyment or possession, the names of persons (in possession) and the characteristic geography or lie of the land. The general rule was (as stated by Nar. XIV.9)

A single witness not to settle boundary 

505 

that a single witness however confident he might be (or how over reliable ) should not take upon himself to point out and settle the boundary, since this ( boundary ) dispute being a very important ( difficult ) matter, its decision should rest with many, The Mit. ( on Yāj. II. 152 ), explains that this prohibition holds good only if the single witness is one not accepted by both sides as reliable. But Nār. ( XIV. 10 ) and Bļ. (S. B. E. 906 33 p. 352 verse 11 ) hold that where a single witness accepted by both sides has to settle the boundary (in the absence of more witnesses and in the absence of reliable patent or concealed signs ) he should do so after placing a clod of earth on his head, after being dressed in red robes and wearing red flowers and after observing a fast. If it was a śüdra who was to trace or lay down a boundary Visvarūpa 907 on Yāj. II. 156 quotes a prose passage of Brhaspati that he was to be docked in red pieces of cloth, his face was to be smeared with ashes from a cemetery, a mark was to be made on his chest with five fingers dipped in the blood of a goat and the entrails of the sacrificed goat were to be tied round his neck and he was to hold a clod of earth in the right hand. All this was to impress upon him the gravity of the work and the necessity of doing his best impartially. If no knowing witness or no patent or concealed signs are available the king has himself to settle the boundary between the two villages at his own discretion(Yaj. II. 153, Nār. XIV.11, Manu VIII. 265). He may divide the land between the two villages equally and construct new marks of boundaries, but if the disputed land will be of greater benefit to one village than to the other the king may assign the whole of the disputed land to the former. Manu VIII. 245 prescribes that when there is a boundary dispute between two villages the king should decide it in the month of Jyestha when the embankment (marks) become quite clear ( owing to water being dried up in summer). The decision made by the witnesses or neighbours became final only after the lapse of three weeks if no calamity (from act

of God or king) befell the witnesses (Kat. 751).908 Manu prescribes (VIII. 261) that the boundary settled by witnesses should be fixed by the king (or recorded in a document containing the names of witnesses ). An ancient instance of the fixing of boundaries by two foudatory chiefs is recorded in the Bhumara stone Pillar inscription of the Parivrājaka Mahāraja Hastin and Mahārāja Sarvanātha, who erected a pillar at Ambloda to show the boundary between their territories about 510 A. D. (vide Fleet's Gupta Inscriptions No. 24 p, 110). Vide also E. I. vol. 24 pp. 32-34 for inscriptional evidence about the carrying out of all the details laid down in dharmaśāstra works on the settlement of boundaries. Manu VIII, 263, Yaj. II. 153, Nar. XIV. 7 prescribe the middle amer cement for each one of the sāmantas that falsely settle the boundaries, while Manu (VIII. 257) and Nar. XIV.8 prescribe the first amercement only for other witnesses such as members of corporations and elderly villagers. If through friendship, greed or fear the witnesses who know the facts do not come forward to settle the boundary they are each to be fined in the highest amercement (Kat.909 750). 

Br. (S. B.E. 33 p. 353 verses 19-21) lays down certain interesting rules about alluvion and diluvion. Where a river is the boundary between two villages and the river carries away soil from one village and attaches it to another, the accretion belongs to the village to which it becomes attached, but this is so when the soil carried away has no crops growing on it; if however soil with growing crops is separated from a village and joined to another by a river in flood, the former owner can reap only the crops and the land will belong to the village or field to which it has become attached 910.

Decision of boundaries of fields &c. 

507 

Manu VIII. 262, Yaj. II. 154, Nār. XIV. 12, Kāt. 749 pres cribe that the decision of disputes about the boundaries of fields, wells, tanks, groves and parks, palaces, houses, cottages, temples and channels carrying rain water is to be similarly arrived at by the testimony of witnesses ( sāmantas and others). 

Several rules are laid down by Nār., Bř. and Kat. about easements and water-courses. 

Br. (S. B. E. 33 p. 354 verse 24) prescribes that no 911 inter ference should be caused to the manner of the enjoyment of houses ( as regards doors, compounds &c.), to the enjoyment of water and markets in the way in which they had been enjoyed from the time the village or house was established or built. This means, acc. to the Sm. C. II. p. 234 and V. P. p. 363 that if a new mode of enjoyment is started in the case of these after the village was established or the house was built then inter ference may be allowed. Br. (8. B. E. 33 p. 354 verse 25) further says that anoient windows, 912 watercourses, balconies (pegs?), raised platforms on the borders of streets, waterspouts carrying rainwater from a square of houses (and cottages ) en joyed from former days should not be allowed to be interfered with, even if they might cause some inconvenience to the neigh bouring house. Kāt. (752-753) similarly provides 'one should not interfere with the base of the wall, a drain (or waterspout), a balcony, window, watercourse and dwelling house of another. These are not to be added to one's house after the first building of it (so as to cause obstruction or annoyance to another), one should not open a window 913 ( so as to command a view) in the interior of another's house or open a spout (that will drain off

One should construct places (pits) for depositing ordure, urine and filthy water, a fireplace and a pit at a distance of at least two cubits from the walls of other people (his neighbours ) and should not construct these very near to another's house (vide also Bp. S. B. E. vol. 33 p. 354 verses 25-26). 

Bș. (S. B. E. 33 p. 354 verse 27) defines a samsarana94 as the road by which men and beasts pass to and fro without let .or hindrance. Kat. (755) calls it catuspatha and defines rūja mürga as the road by which people are allowed to pass at certain times (and not at all times). Several rules are prescribed by Kautilya and others for obviating nuisances on public roads or near private houses. Bļ. (S. B. E. 33 p. 354 Verse 28) and Kat. (756) provide that roads should not be obstructed by parking 95 carts and the like thereon, that no one should plant anything on a public road, that a man who puts obstruction on the public road, makes pits or plants trees or wilfully voids excrement thereon should be fined a māsaka, and one who does not give 916 precedence on the road to his guru, preceptor or the king should be fined. Manu IX. 282 prescribes the fine of two kārşāpanas for voiding or dropping ordure on the public road in the absence of distress and requires the wrongdoer to clean the road, but Manu (IX. 283 ) makes an exception in the case of persons diseased, very old men, a pregnant woman and a child, who are not to be fined but only reproved for voiding ordure on the road. Vide Matsya 227. 175-76 for the same two verses. Kauţ. II. 36917 pres cribes the fine of of a pana for throwing dust on a cart-road and 4 for obstructing it with mud and a fine double of these

(758-759 ) provides 918 that he who defiles a tānk, a garden or holy water (or ghats ) by throwing filthy matter (ordure &c.) therein should be made to remove the filth and fined the first amercement and also one who pollutes by washing soiled clothes in holy and purifying sacred places (ghats &c.) established by great or saintly persong. Yāj. II. 155 prescribes the first, the highest and middling amercements respectively for making breaches in the boundary (between two or more fields ), for ploughing a field beyond the boundary of one's field and for depriving a man of his field by intimidation and the like. Vide also Vispu Dh. S. V. 172 and Sankha-Likhita 919 who prescribe a fine of 1008 paņas for transgressing ( the whole of) the boundary (of a field). Manu VIII. 264 ( = Matsya 227, 30) provides a fine of 200 papas for seizing another's field, garden or house through inadver tance, but 500 for seizing any one of these by intimidation. Nār. XIV, 13-14 and Kāt, ( 760–761 ) state 920 that the fruits and flowers of those trees that grow on the boundary between two fields should be declared ( by the Judge ) as joint between the owners of the two fields and that if the branches of trees grow ing in one man's field spread over another man's field that man should be understood to be the owner of the trees and branches ( together with fruit &c.) in whose field the trees are born (have taken root). The first proposition implies that if one owner

A setu (watercourse ) is said by Nār. (XIV. 18 ) to be of two kinds, viz. that which is dug ( kheya ) into the soil in order to drain off excessive water and that which is constructed (bandhya) as an embankment to prevent water from flowing away. Yaj. II. 156 and Nār. XIV. 17 provide that a setu made by the owner of one field in the neighbouring field should not be forbidden by the owner of that field, if the loss of soil it causes (to the latter ) is small as compared with the great benefit that it may confer. Nār. ( XIV. 20-21 ) and Yaj. II. 157 prescribe that one should make a dike or watercourse on an other's land with the permission of that man or with the permis sion of the king as otherwise he cannot reap the benefit thereof. Kāt. (762-63) provides a similar rule about the repairs to a house or garden or tank made by a stranger without the owner's or the king's permission. It is stated by Nār. ( XIV. 23-25 ) that when the owner of a field is unable ( to cultivate it) or is dead or is not heard of, if a stranger cultivates the field without objection from any body, the stranger shall enjoy the produce of the field, that if the owner (or his son) returns while the field is being tilled by a stranger, he can get his field back on repayment to the stranger of all the money expended on making the land ( ready for crops ). If the owner is unable to return the expenses, the stranger may retain th of the produce every year for eight years giving 3th to the owner every year and should hand over the field to the owner when the 8th year arrives. Yāj. II. 158 and Vyāsa provide that if a person takes a field from the owner on rent for cultivation, but gives up the cultivation after slightly ploughing it and does not employ someone else to complete the cultivation, then he should be made to pay the produce that would have been recovered from the field if properly cultivated and also should be fined and the field may be taken from him and given to another tonantu

CHAPTER XXIII 

VAKPĀRUSYA AND DANDAPARUSYA 

( Abuse and defamation; assault) 

Vakpāruşya, dandapārusya, steya, strisangrahana, sāhasa are five titles out of 18 that are concerned with what may be called criminal matters or crimes in modern nomenclature. Vide under sāhasa below. 

Nār, XVIII. 1 defines vākpārusya as 'abusive words that loudly proclaim censure of another's country, caste, family and the like and that cause mental pain or offence to that man. Kat. (768) defines it as 92 consisting in making the sound 'hum' (of defiance) before another or coughing before him, of imitating or uttering before another whatever is censurable according to popular notions. Nār. (XVIII. 2-3) says that abuse is of three kinds, nişthura ( reproachful such as calling a man a fool or a rogue), atlila (obscene or insulting), tiura (mercilessly severe such as charging a man with such grave sins as brāhmana-murder or drinking liquor ) and that the punishment for each later one is more severe than for each preceding one. Examples of the abuse of country, caste and family are respectively 'the Gaudas are quarrelsome', 'brāhmaṇas are extremely greedy', 'persons of the Viśyāmitra gotra commit cruel deeds'. Br. (S. B. E, vol, 33 p. 355 verses 2-4) divided vākpārusya into three kinds viz. lowest ( when the country, caste or family of a person is abused or sinfulness is ascribed without specifying any definite act), middling (speaking that the abuser will have sexual inter course with the mother or sister of the abused or ascribing the commission of upapātakas 923 or minor sins to the abused ), highest (charging him with taking forbidden food or drink or mercilessly exposing or ascribing the grave sins to a person ). Various fines are prescribed in the smrtis that depend upon the above distinctions and also on the castes of the abuser and the

abused. For example, Manu VIII. 267 (=Nar.XVIII. 15-Mataya 227. 66) prescribes the punishments of 100 paņas, 150 or 200 paņas, corporal punishment respectively against a kşatriya or a vaisya or a śūdra abusing a brāhmaṇa and conversely Manu VIII. 268 ( = Nār. XVIII. 16 ) provides that a brāhmaṇa oalum niating a kşatriya, vaišya or sūdra should respectively be fined 50, 25 or 12 panas. In the case of the abuser and the abused being of the same varna the fine for ordinary abuse is 12 papas, but double of this if the abuse is, according to 

Manu VIIL 269 ( = Nar.XVIII. 17), foul (relating to mother, sister &c.). Vide Yaj. II. 206-207, Visnudharmasutra. V.,35. From the remarks of the Sm. C. and the Madanaratna it appears that these discriminating provisions 924 based on the caste 925 and the agcription of minor or grave sins had become a dead letter and were not being enforced by the kings in India by the 12th century A. D. at least. One or two matters, however, may be noted. Manu VIII. 268-272 and 274 are the same as Nar. XVIII. 16-17, 22-24. Even the truth of an imputation926 afforded no complete exemption e. 8. if a person angrily calls & man a thief (who was once convicted of it) or speaks of him as blind or cripple, the former would be fined at least one karsapana (Manu VIII. 274 = Nar. XVIII. 18). Kaut. (III. 18) provides in this case three papas 92n as fine and Visnudharmasatra (V.37) two panas. When the

imputation is false all provide for a fine double of that pro vided in case the imputation is true. Ironic praise of a man (such as describing one who is blind of one eye as one endowed with a beautiful eye) is made punishable by Kaut. (III. 18). To warn 928 a man against associating with a person who is guilty of a grave sin or of theft does not entail punishment if the truth of the imputation be established (Kāt. 776). Aco. to Kaut. and Kāt. (775) the king was to award only half the fine prescribed if the accused said 'what I uttered in abuse was done through ignorance, carelessness, rivalry or friendship; I shall not again do so'929. A person who abuses a king doing his duty was to have his tongue cut off or forfeited all his property (Nar. XVIII. 30, Yāj. II. 302). Ap. II. 10. 27. 14 prescribed for a südra that abused any one of the three higher castes leading a religious life the punishment of the cutting of the tongue 930. 

Dandapūruşya (assault). Kaut. II. 19 begins his treatment of this topic by saying that it comprises touching, threatening to strike and actually striking another 931. Nār. XVIII. 4 defines it as injuring the limbs of another with the hand, foot, weapon or other means (such as stones) or defiling or causing pain by (bringing) ashes and similar substances in contact with another. The Mit. on Yāj. II. 212 explains that even causing injury to animals and trees would fall under this title. Nār. XVIII. 5-6 provide that assault may be of three kinds viz. mild, middling and highly punishable according as a person merely makes preparations to assault or attacks without any qualm or causes a wound and that this crime can further be divided into three kinds according as the object attacked is low in value or middling or high. A verse from the Parisista ( quoted by Sm. C. II. p. 327 and V. P. p. 370) states' whoever causes pain or draws blood, wounds, breaks, cuts off, pierces (the limbs or bodies) of living beings is guilty of daņdapāruşya'. According to Bs. (S. B.

[Vol. 

1) dandapāruşya 932 consists in striking (a person) with the hand, with a stone, a club, ashes, mud, dust or a weapon. The Mit. on Yāj. IL 212 following Nar. XVIII. 7-12 lays down certain propositions about both abuse and assault. A person who does not return abuse or does not assault when abused or assaulted, deserves to be commended ; if he returns the abuse or assaults in return, the person who began the quarrel is to be dealt with more severely than the other. When two persons 933 attack each other and there are no means for finding who began the quarrel equal punishment is to be awarded to both; but when two quarrel he who began the quarrel or he who persists longer than the other is to be fined more than the other party and lastly if men of the lowest 934 castes such as svapāka, meda, cũndala, hunters, elephant riders, vrātyas and dāsas ( slaves) assault respectable men and ācāryas then they are to be punished ( whipped) by good men then and there, but if such punishment is not possible, then the king should award corporal punishment (of various kinds according to the nature of the crime) and should not take fines from them, since they are the foulest among men and their wealth also is foul. Kāt. (783 ) and Br. (S. B. E. 33 p. 359 verse 15 ) are to the same effect. The several smrtis lay down various punish ments for various kinds of assaults but no useful purpose will be served by going into details. Kāt. 935 ( 786 ) provides that just as in abuse punishnients depend on the castes of the abuser and the abused 80 also in assaults higher punish ment is to be awarded if the attacker is of a lower caste than the person attacked or lower punishment if the person attacked is of a lower caste. Manu VIII. 286 and Ušanas 936 lay down that the punishment for the offence should be commensurate with

Punishment for assault

the pain or injury caused by the offender to a man or beast. A few examples may be set out. Probably the oldest reference to fines for assault in Sanskrit literature is contained in the Taittiriya Samhita 937 II. 6. 10. 2: 'He who threatens to strike a brāhmaņa shall be fined with a hundred (cows or nişkas ? ), he who strikes a brāhmaṇa shall be fined with a thousand; he who draws blood from him shall not behold the pitss for as many years as there are particles of dust mixed with the blood that falls on them'. 

This passage is interpreted in Jai. III. 938 4. 17 as being a recom mendatary injunction ( puruşārtha ) to all at all times to desist from assaulting a brāhmaṇa. Gaut. ( 21. 20-22 ) and Manu XI. 206–207 appear to take the Tai. S. passage differently and refer the figures of 100 and 1000 to years. Kaut. III. 19 prescribes various fines for various kinds of assaults. Br. (S. B.E. 33 p. 357 verses 2,3 and 7 ) says that if a person throws ashes or the like at another or beats him with the hand the fino should be one māsa, but if he strikes with a brick, stone or stick the fine should be two māsakas ; this however applies when both are of the same caste, but if he assaults a woman who is another's wife or a person of a higher caste, the fine may be higher and higher. For one who bruises the skin of another or draws blood by assault the fine is one hundred paņas, and for him who causes a wound by removing some flesh the fine is six māsakas and he who causes breaking of bones should be banished (Manu VIII. 284 = Nār. XVIII. 29). Kāt. prescribes the highest amerce ment for cutting off the ear, the lip, the nose, the foot, the eye, the tongue, the penis, the hand, and the middle amerce ment for causing injury (or wounding). Gaut. XII. 1, Kaut. III. 19, Manu VIII. 939 279, Yaj. II. 215, Br. provide the punishment of the cutting of that limb with which a südra strikes a person of the three higher castes. And the Mit. on Yāj. II. 215 applies by analogy the same rule to a vaisya striking a ksatriya. Manu VIII. 280 extends the same punishment to a śndra for

merely raising the hand or a club to strike one of a higher caste. Manu VIII. 281-283 (Nar. XVIII. 26-28 ) provide that a person of a low caste defiantly sitting on the same seat with one of a higher caste was to be first branded on the waist and then banisbed or bis hips were to be gashed ( in such a way that he might not die ), that a sūdra defiantly spitting on the body of a brāhmana had his lips cut off or a sūdra voiding urine or fæces on a brāhmaṇa had those offending limbs cut off, or a sūdra defiantly seizing a brāhmaṇa by the hair or the feet or beard or neok or testicles would have both his hands cut off. If several conspire and strike a person who is alone, each one was to be sentenced to twice the punishment prescribed for the offence (Yāj. II. 221, Kaut. 940 III. 19, Visnu Dh. 8. V. 73). Kaut. II. 19, Manu VIII. 287, Yaj. II. 222, Br., Kāt. 787, Visnu Dh, S. V. 75-76 provide that the king should make an offender pay a fine and also the expenses of medical treatment and diet till the wound is healed up and the person attacked is able to do his usual work (vide note 613 above). For mischief to property 941 and for killing or maim ing animals, Kaut., Manu, Yājñavalkya and others provide various fines. For example, Kauţ. III. 19 prescribes that when property of small value is destroyed by a man he should be punished with fine equal to the value of the article and should be made to restore the article or its value to the owner; but in the case of articles of substantial value the fine is double of the value. Manu VIII. 288 is of similar import. Yāj. II. 223 provides varying fines if a person wrongfully causes damage to a wall by knocking it (with a club), or pierces it or divides it into two or demolishes it and makes the offender pay to the owner the cost of restoring it. Manu. VIII. 296–298, Yāj. II. 225-226 prescribe fines for causing death or injury to animals of small value (such as goats) and big animals like elephants, horses and cows. Yāj. II. 227-229, Kaut. III. 19, and Kāt. 793 provide fines for causing loss by injuring or felling trees, shrubs and creepers. Yāj. I. 214 holds 92 that if a person throws mud,

dust or saliva or filthy things on another or strikes with his feet, he should not be fined if he is under the influence of intoxicants at the time or is not in his right mind or does it through mistake, while Kauţ. III. 19 prescribes half of the usual fine in such cases. .. 

An important question is how far the right of private defence of person or property was recognised by the dharma śāstra works. This subject has partly been dealt with in H. of Dh, vol. II, pp. 148–151 in connection with an ātatāyin (a desperate man) who is an incendiary or a poisoner or is armed with a weapon, is a robber, one carrying away another's wife or seizing by force ( a field ). Although there is great diversity of views about killing a brāhmaņa ātatūyin, there is no difference of opinion as to repelling with force culminating even in death an ātatāyin of any other caste. Gaut. VII. 25 allows even a brāhmaṇa to arm himself when his life is in danger. 943 Baud. Dh, S. II. 944 2. 80, Manu VIII. 348-349 lay down that brāhmaṇas and vaiśyas may oppose with force when they are prevented from doing their religious duties by felong or when there are disturbances caused by invasion or the like, for saving their own lives, for preventing the seizure of their cows or other wealth or for protecting women or brāhmaṇas. The Mit. 945 on Yāj. II. 286 remarks that these rules of Manu are applicable when there is no time to report to the king or when delay in opposing violence will mean loss or ruin. According to Kāt. 946 ( 800 ) no blame attaches to a man who kills wicked men that are about to kill another, but when they have desisted from their attempt, they should be arrested and not killed. Aparārka (on Yāj. III. 227) remarks that persons are to be regarded as ātatāyin while they are about to set fire or to kill or they are in the act of setting fire or killing and the like, that where it is not possible to prevent them from doing what

they intend to do except by killing them there only the texts allow killing ; but that where it is possible to prevent them by merely wounding them with a weapon or stick, killing them would be an offence. 947 Medhātithi 947 a on Manu VIII. 348 differs from this and allows the killing of a desperado even after he has carried out his purpose and not only when he is about to carry it out or is in the act of carrying it out. The view of the Mit. on Yaj. II. 21 is that one has a right to oppose and kill another in self-defence, in defence of women and other weak people, who cannot defend themselves against a murderous or violent attack and that even if a wrongdoer of the brāhmaṇa caste was killed in the exercise of such right there is no punish ment at the hands of the king and the prāyaścitta (for killing a brāhmaṇa) is a light one. Similarly a man can kill with impunity animals having claws, horns or fangs or horses or elephants if they attack a person (Kat. 805 q. by Sm. C. II. p. 316).

CHAPTER XXIV 

STEYA (theft). 

In the Rg. there is frequent mention of taskara, stena and tāyu. In Rg. VI. 28. 3 the sage 948 says 'may the cows not disappear from us, may a thief not injure them! In Rg. VIII. 29. 6 it is said "Pūşan guards the ways and knows of concealed treasures as a thief does! From Rg. X. 4.6 it appears that thieves were desperate and bound people with ropes and (from Rg. I. 191. 5 ) that thieves (taskaras ) appeared at night. Tāyu (thief) occurs in Rg. I. 50.2, IV. 38. 5, VI. 12. 5 and is an Indo-Iranian word. The word 'stena'occurs in Rg. VI. 28.7 and means 'one who is a cattle-lifter'. Rg. VIII. 67. 14 indicates that a stena was bound with ropes (when caught). In Rg. VII. 55. 3 the dog is asked to run after a stena and a taskara, the first being probably a thief (who secretly carries away pro perty) and the second a thief who openly carries it away. In the Vāj. 9484 S. XI. 79 (=Tai. S. IV. 1.10.2) we have the malimlu in addition to stena and laskaru. Atharvaveda IV, 3 contains charms against wolves, tigers and thieves (taskaras ). 

Steya is distinguished from sāhasa in Manu VIII. 332, Kaut. III. 17, Nār. XVII. 12 and other works as stated under sahasa below. Kāt. 810 defines 9486 it as 'depriving a man of his wealth either clandestinely or openly and either by night or by day'. Nār. XVII. 17 defines it as 'deprivation of wealth by various means from people that are asleep, careless or intoxicated'. It may be of three kinds according to the value of the thing stolen viz. trifling (when earthen-ware, seats, cots, wood, hides, grass, beans in pods or cooked food is stolen) or middling (when the theft relates to clothes except silken

ones, animals except cows and bulls, metals except gold, rice and barley ), grave or high ( when gold, jewels, silken cloth, women, men, cattle, elephants, horses and the wealth of brahmanas or temples is stolen). Vide Nār. XVII. 13-16 and Yāj. II. 275. Thieves are either prakūša (open or patent) or aprakāśa (secret) acc. to Manu IX, 256, Br. 949 (8. B. E. 33 p. 359 V.2). Acc. to Manu IX. 258-260, Nār. ( parisista 2-3) and Br. (8. B. E. 33 p. 360 verses 3-4) patent thieves are traders who employ false weights and balances, gamblers, quacks, bribers of sabhyas, prostitutes, those who profess to arbitrate, those who manufacture imitation articles, those who subsist by progno sticating good fortune or portents or by magic or palmistry, false witnesses &c. Manu (IX. 261-266) states that in order to find out such thieves the king should employ spies in various disguises at various places such as meeting halls, refreshment rooms, brothels, wineshops, theatres &c. The concealed thieves are those who move about with tools for house-breaking without being observed and whose residence is not known; they are principally 950 of nine kinds viz. one who quietly relieves a man of his money when the latter is attending to something else, a house-breaker, a highway robber (who robs travellers ), a cut-purse, one who steals (or kidnaps ) a woman or a man, cattle, horses and other animals. Yāj. II. 266-268 and Nār. (parišişta 9-12) indicate the various ways in which thieves may be detected and caught viz. by the (police ) officers recovering a part of the booty from a man or by tracing foot-steps, or by seizing one who has been ofton found to be a thief, or by finding out that the man suspected cannot state his place of residence; and they recommend that on suspicion others may be caught, if on being questioned they attempt to conceal their caste or name or if they are found addicted to gambling, wine and women or if their mouth becomes dry or their voice changes or if they spend lavishly though they have no ostensible means of earning, or those who sell lost or second-hand goods or who move about in disguise or who are found making inquiries about others' houses

or wealth. The Mit, on Yāj. 951 II. 268 quotes Nār. and gives the warning that the king must carefully examine whether the man caught is really the thief and should not convict merely on suspicion, since even an innocent man may have stolen property near him or betray some of the signs noted above. When pro perty alleged to be stolen is found with a man, it may be that the articles came to his hands from another's hand or he may have taken it up when it lay unclaimed on the ground or he may have taken it as a thief; liars often have the appearance of honest men and vice versa (Nar. I. 71)952. Nārada's dictum (I. 42) that one who is not a thief may be held to be a thief as in the case of Mandavya has already been quoted above (p. 357n. 549 ). Vide Manu IX, 270 ( = Matsya 227.166) cited on p. 355 above. When a person is seized on suspicion of being a thief he could not be acquitted on his mere denial of the offence. He had to prove innocence by ordinary evidence (such as proof that he was elsewhere when the theft was committed) or ordeals (Yāj. II. 269). The general rule about the punishment of patent thieves was that the punishment was to be proportionate to the lightness or gravity of the crime and not to their wealth ( Vyāsa ) 953. Br. (S. B. E. 33 p. 361 verses 10 ff) quoted in Par. M. III. pp. 439-440 and V. P. pp. 387-88 prescribes various punishments for parti cular kinds of patent thieves e. g. sabhyas giving wrong deci sions (for bribes) or those who deceive by betraying the trust imposed in them are to be banished. Manu IX. 292 ( = Matsya 207. 184-185) holds that the goldsmith is the worst of all deceitful persons ( kantakas) and if he is found committing fraud his limbs should be cut off bit by bit. 

As regards the concealed thieves the texts lay down special rules. Nār. XVII. 21 extends to theft of the three kinds men tioned above the same punishments that are awarded in the three kinds of sahasa. Manu VIII. 323 prescribes death sentence for kidnapping men of good family and particularly women

and for theft of costly jewels; while Vyasa prescribes death by burning on red-hot iron bed for kidnapping women and mutilation of hands and feet for kidnapping a man. Yaj. Il. 273 provides impalement for those who confine others as captives, for those who steal horses and elephants and who strike others with violence, while Manu IX. 280 prescribes death for those who break royal store-houses and armoury, the inner shrine in a temple and who steal horses, chariots and elephants. For him who commits theft by housebreaking at night Manu (IX. 276 ) and Bț. (S. B. E. 33 p. 361, verse 17 ) provide impalement 954 after cutting off his hands. Yāj. II. 274, Manu IX. 277, Vigpu Dh. S. V. 136 prescribe for the cut-purse the punishment of the cutting of the thumb and index finger for the first offence, the cutting of the hand and foot if it is the second offence and death if he repeats the same offence a third time. Not only was the thief made to undergo punishment but he was also liable to make good the loss of property to the person robbed ( Manu VIII. 320, Yāj. II. 270, Vignu Dh. S. V. 89, Nār, parisista 21 ). According to Nār. (parisista 22-24) for thefts of articles of small value the fine was five times their price, while Manu (VIII. 326-329 ) said it was twice as much as the price. Gaut. XII. 12-14,955 Manu VIII. 337-338, Nār. (parisista 51-52 ) lay down that the fine for theft is higher in the case of the higher castes i. e. if the südra thief is fined eight times of the value of the article stolen, the vaisya, ksatriya and brāhmaṇa thieves were respectively fined 16, 32 and 64 times the price of the article, as each is deemed to know better owing to his higher status and culture. Manu VIII. 380 lays down the general rule that a brāhmaṇa offender was not to be killed whatever the offence might be but he was to be banished from the country allowing him to take with him all his wealth. But there were other provisions and exceptions also. Kāt.956 ( 823 ) states that

Views on punishment of thieves 

523 

the school of the Mānavas declared that thieves caught with the stolen things on them should be at once banished but that the school of Gautama disapproved of this mode, since it is condemned because it entails loss ( reduction) of people in the country. The V. R. p. 332 explains this verse as referring to a learned brāhmana. Two more verses of Kāt. (824-825 ) are quoted by V. R. P. 332 and V. C. p. 92 the first of which provides that a brāhmaṇa who is not learned whether caught with booty or not should be branded (with the appropriate signs) and deprived of all his property, provided his guilt is brought home with certainty and the second provides that a brāhmana thief who is neither learned nor rich but is strongly built should be kept under guard with fetters on his feet, should be fed on meagre food and made to do hard labour for the king till his death. Gaut. XII. 46-48, Nār. ( parisista 13-14), Manu IX. 271 and 278, Kāt. (827) hold that the punishment for those who knowingly give food, fire ( when they feel cold ), water or asylum to thieves or who receive or purchase stolen property or who conceal them are to be punished like the thieves themselves. 957 Yāj. II. 276 prescribes the highest amercement for any one who knowingly gives help to a thief or murderer in the above ways or by directions or by supplying tools or money wherewith to go to a place for committing the offence. 

In certain cases a person could take without being liable to be punished as a thief certain things belonging to another even if he had not the latter's permission. Gaut. XII. 958 25, Manu VIII. 339 ( = Matsya 227, 112-113), Yaj. II. 166 allow a person of the three higher castes to take grass, fuel-sticks, flowers of trees and plants for feeding cows and for the worship of fire from any place as if they belonged to himself and also fruits of trees that were not enclosed. In such cases he would not be liable to a fine nor does he incur sin ( Kullūka on Manu VIII. 339). A smrti passage stating that if a man takes

grass or fuel or flowers or fruits without permission deserves to have his hand cut off is explained by the Mit. (on Yāj. 166 ), Aparārka p. 774 and others as meant to apply to persons other than dvijas or as meant to refer to a case where they are taken by a person who has really no difficulty in securing these or where these are not taken for the use of cows or for worship. This matter had been a subject of discussion from ancient times. Ap. Dh. S.959 (I. 10. 28. 1--5) contains a discussion from which it appears that Kautsa, Harita, Kāņva and Puşkarasādi were of the opinion that whatever (however trifling or in whatever circumstances ) a man took without the consent of the owner, he became a thief; that Vārsyāyani held that there were exceptions to this rule viz. that owners should not forbid the taking (of a small quantity of ) grain in pods (such as mudga or müşa) or grass for bulls yoked to carts, but that if large quantities even of these were taken there would be theft. Sānti 165. 11-13, Manu XI. 16-18 and Yāj. III. 43 state that when a brāhmaṇa or other person has fasted for three days because he has had no grain with him, he may on the 4th day take grain for one day's meal from any where he can get, whether from a threshing floor or from a field or a house, and that if the owner questioned he should declare to him the reason, but a person of a lower caste should not in this way take grain belonging to one of a higher caste, unless the latter pursues a sinful course or does not perform the duties of his caste. Vyāsa quoted by Sm. C. I. p. 175 allows a man to commit even theft, when he is in distress for food, first from a person of a lower caste, then from one of the same caste and then from one of a higher caste. Manu VIII. 341 ( = Matsya 227, 110, 114), Nār. ( prakirņaka 39 ), Sankha and Kāt. (822A ) state that a traveller whose food has run out may take from another's land without being liable to punishment two sugarcane stalks, two mülakas (esculent roots ), two cucumbers or melons, five mangoes or promegranate fruit

Sahasa (crimes of violence). Manu VIII. 332, Kaut. III. 17, Nar. XVII. 1, Yaj. II. 230, Kat. (795-796) define sahasa962 as any act which is done with violence in defiance of or in spite of the presence of royal officers or guards or people. The word sahasa is a derivative from 'sahas' meaning 'force' (Nar. XVII. 1). Sometimes it is distinguished from theft (as in Manu VIII. 332, Kaut. III. 17 and Nar. XVII. 12) by saying that theft consists in depriving a person of his wealth stealthily (without force), while in gāhasa there is the use of force or violence963. Nar. XVII.2 and Br. (S. B. E. vol. 33 p. 359 verse 1) state that sāhasa 964 is of four kinds viz. manslaughter, theft, violence to the wives of others, and the two kinds of pāruşya (treated as one head). Although these topics can be compre hended under sāhasa, they are generally dealt with separately in the smrtis and digests as a matter of convenience and in order to provide heavier punishment for crimes of violence 965, since a man guilty of a crime of violence is a worse ginner than one guilty of abuse, theft or assault (Manu VIII. 345 and 

Mit. on Yaj. II. 230) and Manu VIII. 244 enjoins upon the king not to tolerate for a moment a man guilty of violence. The

V. May, (text p. 2) says that in differentiating steya from sāhasa the maxim of cows' and 'bulls' is applicable 966. 

Sāhasa is divided by Nār. XVII. 3-6 and Br. (S. B. F. 33 p. 363 verse 24) into three varieties, viz. the lowest ( destruction, abuse and trampling of fruits, roots, water, agricultural imple ments), middling (destruction &c. of clothes, food and drink, household utensils), highest (killing with weapons or poison, violence to others' wives and whatever causes pain to sentient beings). These three kinds are respectively punished with the three kinds of punishments described above (pp. 393-94). The principal crimes included under sāhasa in its narrow sense are homicide, rape and robbery. Rape will be dealt with under strisangrahaņa. Br. 967 states the general rule that one guilty of murder by violence should be punished with death and not with fines (S. B. E 33 p. 363 v. 29). To this the brāhmaṇa offender was an exception (Manu IX. 241 ), who was only to be banished. Manu IX. 242 introduces another exception viz. persong other than brāhmaṇas when guilty of the great sins (specified in IX. 235) through negligence should be only deprived of all their property but if they murder a man inten tionally then only are they to be sentenced to death. Manu IX. 232 and Vişnu Dh. S. V. 9-11 provide the punishment of death for those who fabricate false royal edicts, or who tamper with the loyalty of the elements of the State or who kill women, children and brāhmaṇas. Baud. Dh. $.

Sentence of death

the offender to death in various ways and confiscate all his property, but if a man kills another of his own caste or of a lower caste then the king may punish the offender with some punishment appropriate to the crime and the strength of the offender. In IV. 11 Kaut. provides sentences of death in various ways for murder following ancient sāstras, but remarks that if murderers have not been guilty of cruelty they should simply be sentenced to death without torture or the like 99. One special rule deserves notice. Gaut. 22. 12, Ap. Dh, S. I 9, 24 6-9, Manu XI. 87, Vas. 20. 34, Yāj. III. 251 prescribe the same prāyaścitta for murdering a brāhmaṇa woman who is an ātreyi as for one who kills a brāhmaṇa male. The different meanings of 'atreyi' given from ancient times are noted below 970, Texts

I. 4, 5, 13 where in explaining why the offerings to Prajāpati are made in a low tone a legend about the goddess 'Vāc' is narrated and it is said that in having sexual intercourse with an ātreyi, a man incurs sin' (FACETTITYT Tea Teat). Here the word appears to mean a woman who is in her monthly illness. Vas. ( 20. 35-36) defines ātreyi as a woman who has taken the purificatory bath on the 4th day after her monthly illness begins and derives the word from अत्र 'आत्रयों वक्ष्यामो रजस्वलामृतस्नातामात्रामाहः । अत्र राज्यदपत्यं भवतीति । Vasistba either cites or summarises a Vedic passage ( as stated by Visvarūpa) which means 'here (i. e. in the womb of this woman) a child is to come'. In SBE vol. 14 p. 107 the same is translated as if the husband approaches her at that time) he will have offspring'. But this is not correct. “Eşyat' qualifies 'apatyam' and is not in the masculine.

like Ap. I. 9. 24. 1-5, Gaut. XXII prescribe different praye soittas for murder depending upon the castes and gexes of the murderer and the murdered. These will be briefly dealt with under prāyascitta later on. In certain cases acc. to Manu VIII. 291-292, Yāj. II. 298–299, Kaut. IV. 13, though death or injury to persons or loss of property results, no punishment was pres cribed viz, when the nose-string of bulls yoked to a cart snaps, when the yoke breaks, when the cart swerves on one side owing to the unevenness of the ground, when the axle or wheel breaks or when the leather thongs with which the several parts of the cart are tied give way, or when the rope cast round the necks of bulls or the reins break or when in spite of the driver loudly calling upon a person to move aside from the way an accident occurs. But Manu VIII. 293, 294 (=Matsya 227, 95-96) pro vide that where through the want of skill of the driver know ingly engaged by a master the cart is overturned and injury is caused, the master should be fined 200 paņas, but if the driver employed be known to be skilful, then when injury is caused the driver should be fined (and not the employer). Further if the driver, though seeing that the road is blocked by cattle or other carts, rashly drives and kills men and animals he should be punished (Manu VII. 295). It is stated by Nār. (pārusya 32, S. B. E. vol. 33 p. 212) that the father is not liable for his son's offence, nor is the owner of a horse, dog or ape liable to punishment (for injury caused by any of these ) provided they are not set up (to do harm) by the owner. If a driver kills a man by rash or negligent driving he is to be punished like a thief; if he kills any one of the larger aninals (such as a cow, a horse, a camel or elephant) the punishment would be half of the preceding; if he kills one of the inferior animals, the fine would be two hundred. Kaut. III. 19, Manu (VIII. 285), Yaj. II. 227-229 and Vişnu Dh. S. V. 55-59 prescribe graduated fines for the destruction of trees, plants and branches, flowers and fruits according to their usefulness and sanctity. The gmptis made a distinction as regards punishments between orimnes of violence and crimes due to negligence or mistake. For example, Manu VIII. 264 ( =Matsya 227. 30 ) prescribes a fine of 500 paņas for depriving a man of his house, garden or Beld by threats of violence, but only prescribes a fine of two hundred if a man depripas another of his house &o. by mistake.

Punishment for abettors 

$29 

Various rules were laid down about inciters or abettors. Yaj. L. 231 and Kanţ971. III. 17 prescribe for the man who incites another to crimes of violence double the punishment to be inflicted on the perpetrator himself and four times for one who incites another by. assuring him 'I shall give as much money as will be required'. Kāt. (798) and Br. 972 (S. B. E. 33 p.363 vers 31 ) prescribe that if several violently beat a man to death, he who gives the fatal blow on a vital part is declared to be the murderer and is to suffer the full punishment for murder. Kat. ( 832-834) 973 and Bṛ. (S. B. E. 33 p. 364 verse 32) provide that he who commences a crime of violence, who is a helper, who gives advice as to the way (in which sāhasa je to be carried out ), who gives refuge ( asylum) to the offender or supplies weapons, who gives food to wrongdoers, who incites ( offenders ) to put up a fight, who shows how the person ( killed ) is to be destroyed, who connives ( at the commission of an offence ), who exposes the faults of the person killed ), who gives his approval ( to the offence ), who though able does not forbid or prevent the com mission of the offence all these are (practically ) perpetrators of the crime and the king should award punishment accord ing to their ability and their guilt. Vide also Āp. Dh. S. II. 11. 29. 1. 974 For those who begin an offence or abet its commission Bţ. (S. B. E. 33 p. 364 verse 32 ) prescribes half the punishment prescribed for the wrongdoer. 975 Yāj. (II. 232 242 ) enumerates several kinds of offences as allied to sāhasa and prescribes punishments therefor, such as breaking a house that is closed under seal, causing harm to neighbours and kulikas

CHAPTER XXV 

STRĪSANGRAHAŅA (Adultery or unlawful intercourse 

with a woman ). 

The Mit. ( on Yāj. 11.976 283 ) states that sangrahana means the unlawful coming together of a man and a woman for sexual enjoyment. Bp. (S. B. E. 33 p. 365 verses 1-2) says that sinful 977 sangrahaņa is of three kinds, viz. brought about by force, deceit or sensual passion. The first (which is rape ) occurs when intercourse is had in a secluded place against the will of a woman, or with a woman who is intoxicated or is disordered in mind or is under a mistake or when she raises a cry; the second occurs when a woman is brought to one's house by some trick or pretence, an intoxicant (such as Dhatura) is administered to her or her mind is brought under control ( by chants or otherwise ) and sexual intercourse takes place; the third occurs when intercourse takes place by conveying (passion ) to each other by means of the eyes ( glances) or by employing a go-between and when the parties are drawn to each other by the temptation of beauty or of wealth. This last is again of three kinds acc. to Vyāsa and Br. ( S. B. E. 33 p. 365-66 verses 6-8 q. by Sm. C. II. p. 8) viz. trifling, middling and grave. The first is characterised by winking at a woman, smiling at her, sending a go-between, touch ing her ornaments or clothes; the second by the sending of flowers, unguents, fruits, incense, food, clothes, and indulging in private talks ; the third is characterised by lying on the same bed, dalliance, kissing and embraces. Stri sangrahaņa by force (that is rape ) is really included under

sāhasa, 978 as stated by the Madanaratna, the V. P. pp. 396 397 and others. The punishments for rape were very heavy. Bp. (8. B. E. 979 33 p. 366 verse 10) states that if a man commits rape on a woman of the same caste, he was to forfeit all his property, to have bis penis and testicles cut out and was to be paraded on the back of an age, that if the woman raped was of a lower caste, then half of this punishment was to be awarded and if she was of a higher caste, he was to be sentenced to death together with confiscation of all property. Kāt. (830) prescribes that when 980 a man has forcibly had sexual intercourse with a woman capital punishment is to be inflicted inasmuch as it is a violation of (proper) conduct. When sexual intercourse was had by deceit the man was puni. shed with confiscation of all property, with branding on the forehead of the sign of the female private parts and banishment from the town (Bộ, in S. B. E. 33 p. 366 verse 981 11). Here also the rule of Bț. cited above (about the reduction of sentence according to the caste of the woman concerned) applies. In the case of rape and sexual intercourse by deceit the woman was not at all punished 982 but she had to undergo a penance (prāya ścitta) of kşcchra or parāka for contact with a male other than her husband and till she performed the prāyaścitta she was to be kept well-guarded in the house, was to remain dirty (i. e.

not to deck herself or apply or use perfumes &c.), to lie on the ground (not on a bed-stead or couch), was to receive bare main tenance. After performing prāyaścitta she was restored to her former position. Acc. to Yaj. II. 286 and Br. (S. B. E. 33 p. 366 verse 12), for adultery (in which there is consent) the highest fine is prescribed for the male in the case of a woman of the same caste, half of this in the case of a wonian lower in caste (than the paramour), but when adultery is committed with a woman of a higher caste the male shall be put to death and the woman shall have her ears and the like cut off. Vide Shakespeare's Othello IV. 1, where Othello exclaims 'I see that nose of yours but not that dog I shall throw it to'. There were other sages who were humane and opposed to the punishment of disfigurement by way of the cutting of the ear or the nose. Yama 982a states that in the case of a woman guilty of adultery at her will, there was to be no punishment of death or disfigure ment, but only abandonment. Kāt. ( 487 ) lays down the general rule that in all offences women should be sentenced to half the fine in money which is prescribed for a male and that when the punishment is death for a male the punishment for a woman would be cutting off a limb (vide note 626 ). 

Nār. (XV. 73-75) holds 983 that sexual intercourse with the step-mother, mother's sister, mother-in-law, the paternal or maternal uncle's wife, father's sister, a friend's or pupil's wife, sister, sister's friend, daughter-in-law, daughter, the wife of one's vedic teacher, a woman of the same gotra, a woman that has sought protection, with the queen or an ascetic woman (pravrajitā) or a wet-nurse or a virtuous wife (sādlwi) or a woman of a higher caste is incestuous and the punishment to be prescribed for this crime is the excision of the penis and no less.

purāņa 227. 139–141, which latter (three) prescribe excision of the penis and death by way of punishment (except for a brāh mapa) and expiation and for the woman ( if she was a consent ing party ) death sontence. Bșhad-Yama III. 7, Ap. (in verse) IX. 1 (Jivananda od.) and Yama (Anandāśrama) 35 prescribe that there is no expiation except that of entering fire for incest with mother, teacher's wife, sister or daughter. It is remarka ble that Kaut. 985 and Yāj. (II. 293 ) prescribe only a fine of 24 papas for adultery with a female ascetic, while Nār. XV. 74 and Matsya 227, 141 deem it a most heinous offence. The explanation probably lies in the fact that Kaut and Yaj. refer to female ascetics of the lowest castes not following the orthodox religion, while Nār. refers to nuns of a higher order. Vide Manu VIII. 363 also. For forcible intercourse with a prostitute against 986 her will Kaut. IV. 13 and Yāj. 11. 291 prescribe a fine of 12 and 24 panas respectively. For unnatural offences or offences against the order of nature, Kauţ. IV. 13, Yaj. II. 289, 293, Vişnu Dh. S. V. 44, Nār. XV. 76 provide fines of 12, 24, 100, 500 paņas 987, 

Manu IV. 134 ( = Anušāsana 104.21 = Mārkandeya-purāņa 34. 62-63) forbids a man to have sexual intercourse with an other's wife and states that there is nothing so detrimental to long life as that. There are stray indications in the Vedic literature about sexual intercourse outside marriage. Vide H. of Dh. II. pp. 637-639. In Rg. I..92. 4 ( adhi pesāinsi vapate nstūr iva) there appears to be a reference to a danoing girl or hetaira. Wives hating (or proving false ) to their husbands are believed to go to Hell in Rg. IV. 5. 5 (patiripo na janayo durevāḥ ). In Rg. II. 29. 1 the sage prays to the Adityas' remove away from me sin as a woman who gives birth to a child in secret removes it'( are matkarta rahasür-ivāgah). The gambler (in Rg. X. 34, 4) states others have intercourse with his wife' (anye jāyām pari mrsantyasya). The word puiscali occurs in Vāj. S. XXX. 22. We have already seen ( H. of Dh. II. pp. 576, 1098 ) how in the Varuņapraghasa (one of the Caturmāsyas) the wife of the sacrificer had to confess if she had a lover and how even after

she confessed to having had one she was allowed to co-operate in the sacrifice on undergoing an expiation. After a man perform ed the solemn sacrifice called Agnicayana he was enjoined (Tai. S. V. 6. 8. 3)988 not to approach a sūdra woman and after he performed Agnicayana twice he was not to approach another's wife ( H. of Dh, vol. II. p. 1255 ). 

The punishment for sangrahaņa (rape and adultery) varied according to the caste of the man and the woman, according as the woman was married or unmarried and according as she was guarded (guptā ) or unguarded. Vide Gaut. XII. 2, Vas. XXI. 1-5, Manu VIII. 359, Vişnu Dh. S. V. 41, Yaj. II. 286, 294, Nār. XV. 70 (as to higher or lower caste of offender), Gaut. XII. 3, Manu VIII. 374-378, 382-385, Kauț. IV, 13 ( about offence against guarded or unguarded woman), Manu VIII. 364-370, Yāj. II. 285, 287, Kaut. IV. 12, Nār. XV, 71-72 ( about maidens ). Further the ancient sūtras and smrtis prescribe more severe sentences than later smộtis. Details of these matters are passed over here for want of space and as being now of academic interest only. But some examples may be noted. Gaut. XXIII. 14-15 and Manu VIII. 371 prescribe for an adulteress death by being devoured by dogs, but Yāj II. 286 softened the rigour of this. Āp. Dh. 8. ( II. 10. 26. 20-21) prescribed the penalty of cutting the penis and testicles for the male if guilty of adultery with a married woman, but only confiscation of all property if he committed adultery with an unmarried woman. But Yaj. II. 288, Manu VII. 366, Nār. XV. 72 went so far as to say that if a man had sexual intercourse with a maiden ( of the same caste) who encouraged his advances, then there is no offence punishable by the king, but he was to bestow ornaments on her, honour her and must marry her. 

It has further to be noted that Yaj. II. 290 and Nār. (XV, 79 ) 989 make it punishable to visit a dasi kept by a man in his own house or outside and Yaj. prescribes the fine of 50 paņas for so doing. Vide H. of Dh. vol. II. pp. 637-639 about prostitutes. But Manu VIII. 362 states that the rules making conversation with others' wives in lonely places punishable does not hold good in the case of the wives of actors, singers

and those who live on the earnings of their wives, since they themselves introduce their wives to others and make them mix among men ( while they themselves remain concealed ). 

Stripundharma ( duties of husband and wife). Most of the matters falling under this head have been dealt with in H. of Dh. vol. II. pp. 556-592. The liability of the husband or wife for the debts of the other has been already dealt with under ynādāna. The rights of partition, inheritance and maintenance will be discussed later on under dāyabhāga. Nār. XV. 1 defines this title of law as that in which the rules of the marriage of women and men and other related matters are described. Under this head Nār, speaks of the essential ceremonies of marriage, the rules about selecting a bride and a bridegroom, restrictions as to the caste of the bride, the guardians for marriage, faults or defects in a proposed bride or bridegroom, the forms of marriage, women called punarbhū and svairiņi, the practice of niyoga, illicit sexual intercourse, punishment of women for adultery, re marriage, wrnasankara, mixed castes. In IX. 1 Manu promises that he will dilate upon the obligatory duties of man and wife, whether they are staying together or apart. Manu IX. 2 holds that the first duty of the husband and the males in his family is to keep women dependent and under their control if they become attached to a life of pleasure and Nār, XVI. 30 states that even women of good family come to ruin by independence. The next most important matter acc. to Manu IX. 5 and Br. (S. B. E. 33 p. 367 verse 2 )990 is to guard women against improper attach ments however trifling, since if they go astray they bring sorrow to both families (of the husband and of the father). Acc. to Harita,991. Sankha-Likhita,992 Manu (IX. 7, 9) and others the husband has to guard the wife from the approaches of other men in order to ensure the purity of the issue and by guarding her the husband guards his reputation, family, soul and his dharma,

since a woman gives birth to a son similar to the male with whom she consorts or on whom she sets lier heart during the days after the monthly illness. Here there is some anticipa tion of modern Eugenics. Manu IX 10 was quite clear that women could not be completely guarded by confining them with force in seclusion, that their minds must be occupied in family work as stated by him in IX. 11 and by Bț. (S. B. E. 33 p. 368993 verse 4), that the husband must try to deserve her regard and affection and show her honour (Manu IX. 22-24, 26, Yāj. I. 82). Divorce has been already dealt with in H, of Dh. vol. II. pp. 619-623. Vide Selections from Peshwa's daftar' vol. 43 p. 112 where the divorce of a woman (ghatasphota) is ordered because the husband was really a converted Mahomedan who had been illegally admitted to caste after an incorrect method of expiation.

CHAPTER xxvi 

DYŪTASAMĀHVAYA 

(Gambling and prize-fighting ) Manu IX. 223, Nār. XIX. 1 and Bṛ. (8. B. E. 33 p. 385 verse 3) define dyūta (gambling ) as that sport which is carried on with inanimate objects such as dice, pieces of leather, ivory and the like and in which there is a stake, while sport carried on with animate objects such as cocks, pigeons, rams, buffaloes and wrestlers is called samāhvaya. The attitude of Manu towards gambling was uncompromising. Manu (IX, 221-222, 224-226) calls upon the king to suppress gambling and prize-fighting in his country as they cause the destruction of the State; he states that gambling is open theft and therefore the king should endeavour to put it down and that the king should punish with corporal punishment all those who engage in gambling or who induce or help others to gamble, and that he should banish gamblers from the city because gamblers residing in the country harags wellconducted subjects by their deceitful tricks. Manu IX. 227 ( = Udyogaparva 37. 19) states that in ancient times gambling engendered great enmities and therefore a wise man should not resort to it even for amusement or in jest. Kāt. (934) is to the same effect. Yāj. II. 203 and Kaut. III. 20 994 allowed gambling in a central place under State supervision as it led to the detection of thieves. Br. 995 ( S. B. E. 33 p. 385 verse 1) refers to this divergence of viows: * Gam bling that causes loss of truth, purity and wealth was forbid den by Manu, but others allowed it because it led to the detec tion of thieves, provided it was carried on in the presence of a master of the gambling hall and provided it yielded revenue to the king'.

gambling hall which gamblers made their haunt and who sup plied the dice and other instruments of gambling was called sabhika and the stake or money agreed to be paid by the defeated gambler to the winning gambler was called pana or glaha ( Yaj. II. 199). Nār. XIX. 8 provides an optional method viz. instead 996 of gambling in a hall presided over by a sabhika, gamblers may give the king his share in the stakes, then indulge in gambling openly and if they do so they incur no punishment. Acc. to Yāj. II. 199 as interpreted by Par. M. IIL p. 574 and V. P. p. 565 the sabhika was to receive five per cent or oth part when the stake was 100 panas or more and 10 per cent or ith when the stake was less than 100 panas. Aparārka (p. 802) explains that the sabhika was to receive as his fee five per cent from the victorious gambler and ten per cent from the losing gambler. Nār. XIX. 2 prescri bes a flat rate of ten per cent on the stake as the fee of the sabhika, while Kauç.997 III. 20 lays down the fee as five per cent and allows the sabhika to charge hire for supplying gam bling accessories (such as dice, leather pieces) and for sup plying water and accommodation. The sabhika receiving protec tion from the king was to pay to the king the tax agreed upon by him, was to recover from the defeated gambler the stake (by means of confinement or restraint order ) and pay it over to the victor and was to be honest and forbearing 998 ( Yāj. II. 200, Kāt. 940, Nār. XIX. 2). Kāt. (937) states that the sabhika 999 may give to the winner the money won out of his own pocket and may recover from the losing gambler within three fort nights or at once if there is fear of losing the money, Kāt. (935) 1000 holds that if gambling was to be allowed it must be carried on openly with an arch constructed near the door in order that respectable people might not be misled ( about its real nature ) and it should yield revenue to the king.

unable to make the defeated gambler pay the stake to the victor, the king would make the former pay to the latter provided the gambling was done openly in the presence of the sabhika and a group of gamblers and the king's dues were paid by the sabhika, but not otherwise ( Yāj II. 201 ). Nār. XIX. 6-7 and Yaj. II. 202 provide that when gambling is carried on secretly and without the king's permission or with false dice or other deceitful tricks, the gamblers and the sabhika would not be able to gain their object (i. e. recovering bets won or the fee ) and would be liable to punishment, viz. branding on the head ( with dog's foot and the like ) and banishment. Nār. XIX. 6 adds that the banished gamblers would have wreaths of dice tied round their necks. Kāt. (941) and Br. (S. B. E. 33 p. 386 verse 7) state that a person ignorant of gambling should, if defeated in gambling in private, be released from his liability, but one who is an adept in gambling should not be relieved when defeated; but oven an adept in gambling if he has lost the whole of his wealth as a stake should not be made to pay the whole. 1001 In disputes among gamblers, in deciding on victory or in the matter of gain to the winner, and as regards the question of false dice the keeper of the gaming house, if honest, is the final authority 1002 (Kat. 942). Nār. XIX. 4, Yaj. II, 202, Br. (S. B. E. 33 p. 386 verse 6 ), Kāt. (943) provide that when there is a dispute as to success or defeat the king should appoint gamblers to decide the dispute and gamblers will also be the witnesses in such a dispute ( in spite of the rule stated above on p. 335 that gamblers are not competent witnesses ), but if the gamblers are alleged to be inimical to the disputants the king may then 1003 himself decide the matter. Yāj. II. 203 extends all the rules about gambling to samāhvaya. Bp. (S. B. E. 33 p. 386 verse 4 ) notes that the stake is to be paid by the owner of the animal that is defeated. 1004 The $. V.

thereon that the king gets one-fourth of the stake from each of the owners of the fighting animals and that the animal that is defeated (except a wrestler or a buffalo ) is to be made over, whether living or dead, to the owner of the winner. The Mānasollāsa (vol. III. p. 229) contains an elaborate description of a king's amusenients' by way of wrestling matches, cock fights &c. The Dasakumāracarita makes frequent reference to gambling. In Ucchvāsa II. (p. 47) we are told that there are 25 kalās on which gambling depends, that legal proceedings between gamblers were decided by reliance on the sabhika and that out of a stake of 16000 dināras, the successful gambler took half and distributed the other half among the sabhika and the denizens of the gambling hall. 

Gambling is one of the most ancient vices. Rg. X. 34 is a hymn which contains the lament of a gambler. Elsewhere also in the Rg. gambling is referred to. Vide Rg. I. 41. 9 ( ex plained in Nirukta III. 16 ), VII. 86. 6 ( where it is said that dice made of Vibhidaka tree are one of the sources of sin), Rg. X. 42. 9, X. 43. 5. In the Atharvaveda algo dice and glaha occur frequently. Vide Atharva IV. 16. 5, IV, 38 (a hymn for good luck in gambling). In Vāj. S. 30. 18 we have the words 'akşarājāya kitavam'. In certain solemn sacrifices like the Rājasūya dice play was an important item. Vide H. of Dh, vol. II. p. 1219. Pāṇini teaches the formation of many words relating to gambling. In II. 1005 1. 10 he teaches the formation of Avyayibhāva compounds like 'akşapari' or 

salākāpari' in the sense that loss was caused by one dice being cast in a way different from the way in which it was cast in a prior game'. In IV. 4. 2 he teaches that 'akşika' means one who uses dice in gambling or wins by using 1006 dice and in IV, 4. 19 he states that 'akşadyūtika '1007 means '( enmity ) brought about by using dice in gambling'.

midst of the sabha (hall) having raised a table for playing dioe one should place thereon dice even in number and made from the vibhitaka wood and that players should be men of the three higher castes, pure and devoted to truth. In the Maha bharata Yudhisthira 1009 is made to say that it was his vow not to refuse dice play when he was oballenged to it. It was well known that gambling affects the minds even of the good, while in the case of those who were not ordinarily good it led to dis sensions and calamities. Many modern people Justify the action of Yudhisthira on the ground that the code of ksatriya chivalry and morality of those ancient days required that he should not be afraid to play with dice when challenged by an adversary. Conceding for the sake of argument that indulgence in gambling even on the part of such a virtuous, noble and philosophic warrior as Yudhisthira was justified or at least excusable, there is nothing to show that the code of ksatriya chivalry permitted him to gamble away his own spirited, devoted and virtuous queen and his four valiant brothers. It appears that the real aim of the great author of the Mahabharata is to emphasize that gambling is such a reprehensible pastime' and so ruinous and degrading that even the greatest and the best, when once they indulge in it, lose all sense of duty, morality and of the claims of love and affection. It has already been seen how gambling was looked upon as a great vice in the king by writers on politics and also on dharmasastra. Even the Purānas here and there condemn gambling. For example, the Brahma purāņa (171. 29–38 ) condemns it in strong language. It says. that the gambler's wife is always in distress and the gambler on seeing the condition of his wife is also worried ( this is in almost the same words as Rg. X. 34. 10-11'), that the Veda condemns gambling and that there is no sin comparable to ganıbling.

CHAPTER XXVII 

DAYABHAGA ( Partition of wealth ) 

The word dāya has been used even in the oldest period of the Vedic Literature. Rg. II. 32. 4 ( dadātu viram satadāyam ukthyam ) has already been quoted above (on p. 388). In Rg. X. 114, 10 ( śramasya dayam vibhajantyebhyah) the meaning of the word seems to be 'a share' or ' reward'. In the Tai. S. and the Brāhmanas the word dāya appears to be employed in the sense of paternal wealth' or simply 'wealth'. In the story of Nābhā nediştha 1010 it is stated that Manu divided his daya among (for) his sons' (Tai. S. III 1. 9.4). That' dāya' here stands for ' dhana' follows from another passage of the Tai. S. (II. 5.2.7) Therefore they distinguish (or establish) the eldest son by wealth'. In the Tāndya Brāhmaṇa 1011 16. 4. 3-5 also it is said Therefore whoever among ( a man's ) sons secures the best or major portion of wealth as dāya, him they regard as the son who would be the lord of all'. Another word viz. riktha occurring in the sūtra and smrti literature is also employed in the Rgveda 1912 III. 31.2 'the son of the body does not give to his sister the ancestral wealth, but makes her the receptacle for the son of her husband'. The word dayāda (meaning a con sharer, one who takes a share ) occurs frequently in the Vedic Literature. In the Tai. S. VI. 5. 8. 2 1013 it is said "Therefore women being destitute of strength take no portion (of Soma )

and speak more weakly than even a wretched (low ) man'. In the Atharvaveda V.18.6 Soma is said 1014 to be the dayāda of the brāhmaṇas. Visvāmitra invites Suna sepa to share in the spiritual wealth ( đāya) belonging to him ( Ait. Br. 33.5), calls upon his song to follow him and states that he (Sunaḥsepa ) would accept them, his wealth (daya) and his learning 1015. The Nir. III. 4 quotes or summarizes other Vedic passages in which the words dāya and dāyāda occur. In Papini IL 3.39 and VI. %. 5 the word dāyāda occurs. 

The principal heads discussed under the vyavahārapada called dāyabhāga are two, viz. partition and inheritance. For at least a thousand years there have been two schools that widely differ on these two heads; they are respectively known as the school of the Mitākşarā and that of the Dāyabhāga on account of the pre-eminent position of these works in the respective schools. The latter school is predominant in Bengal while the former prevails in the whole of India excepting Bengal. But even in Bengal there are in modern times families governed by the law of the Mitakşarā. This work in intention and scope does not profess to be a treatise on modern Hindu Law. It concerns itself with pointing out what the law of the Smstis and writers of medieval digests was and has to eschew an exhaustive discussion of the modern case-law and legislative enactments that have made the Hindu Law appear in many respects to be entirely different from the law of the commen taries and digests. Generally speaking, only very important divergences made by legislation and case law in the ancient and medieval Hindu Law can and may be pointed out here. 

The principal Sanskrit works of the Dayabhāga school are three viz. the Dayabhāga of Jimātavāhana, the Dāyatattva of Raghunandana and the Dāyakramasangraha of Srikrina Tarkalankāra. The Mitakşarī school is subdivided into four sub-schools in which besides the Mitakşarā, the supreme authority, other works are referred to as supplementary to it and as modifying some of its doctrines viz. the Benares school (which regards the Viramitrodaya as of high authority ), the

Mithilā school (which relies on the Vivādaratnakara, the Vivāda candra and the Vivādacintāmaņi), the Mahārāştra or Bombay school (where the Vyavahāramayukha is of the highest authority in Gujerat, Bombay Island and Northern Konkan aven superseding the Mitākşarā in some matters and the Vira mitrodaya and the Nirnayasindhu are also relied upon ), the Dravida or Madras school (where the Smrticandrikā, the Vyava. hāranirpaya of Varadarāja, the Parāšara-madhaviya and the Sarasvativilāsa are also works of authority ). In spite of some differences in the rules accepted in different provinces in all of which the Mitākşarā is of high authority, all the provinces except Bengal are held to be governed by one school. Vide 

Ambabai v. Keshav I. L, R, (1941 ) Bom, 250. 

The words dāya and vibhāga have been variously defined in the digests. Nār. ( dāyabhāga, verse 1) defines the vyavahāra pada dāyabhāga as one in which sons arrange for the partition of their father's wealth. The Madanaratna as noted by the V. Mayūkba ( text p. 94) reads' arthasya pitryādeh' (wealth of the father and others ) for pitryagya' in Nārada's verse. The Smrtisangraha quoted in the Sm, C. and other works states that the word dāya applies to wealth that comes to a man through the father or the mother and the Nighantu defines daya as the paternal wealth that is to be divided. 1016 The Dāyabhāga, the Mit, and others explain that the words 'pitryasya'(father's ) and putraih'( by the sons ) in Nār. are only illustrative, the real meaning being that the word 'dāyabhāga' applies wherever the wealth of a relative (father, grand-father &c.) is distributed among his relatives (sons, grandsons &c.) simply on account of their relation to the deceased 1017 owner. This is borne out by the fact that Manu and Nārada both speak of the distribution of the mother's wealth also under dāyabhāga. The Mit. while introducing Yāj. II. 114 says that the word dāya means the wealth which becomes another's property simply by reagon of the fact of his relation to the owner. The V. Mayūkha (p. 93 ) defines daya as that wealth which is to be divided and which is not the wealth of re-united members.

History of Dharmaśāstra 

(Voi 

The word 'daya' though derived from the root. da' (to give ) does not apply to heritable wealth' in the literal sense (of gift).1018 The word dāya is rather conventionally used, though derived from the root 'da'. In a gift ( as stated in H. of Dh. vol. II. p. 841 ) there are two chief ingredients viz.' abandoning one's ownership over a thing and bringing about the owner ship of another in that thing'. But in the case of dāya the deceased does not of his own accord abandon his ownership with the idea of creating ownership in another. The two ( dāna and dāya) are analogous in this that in both there is cessation of the ownership of a man in a thing. 

The Mit., the Par. M., the Madanaratna, the V. Mayükha, the V. P. and other works that follow the doctrines of the Mit. divide daya into two varieties viz.apratibandha(unobstructible) 1019 and 'sapratibandha' (obstructible). The first occurs in the case of sons, grandsons and great-grandsons, who, by the very fact of their being the sons or grandsons, obtain ownership in the (ancestral) wealth held by the father or the grand father. In this case the existence of the father or grandfather presents no obstacle (pratibandha) to the son's or grandson's taking an interest by the very fact of his birth in the family property that is in the hands of the father or grandfather. Therefore this is called apratibandha dāya. But when a man takes the wealth of his paternal uncle or a father succeeds to the wealth of his son because the uncle or the son dies issueless, it is sapratibandha dāya, as in these cases the nephew or the father has no right in the uncle's or son's property as long as the uncle or the son is alive or as long as the uncle or son has a son or grandson. That is, the life of the owner or the existence of a BOR presents an obstacle to the nephew's or father's succes sion. Hence it is sapratibandha dāya. 

It is to be noted that the Dāyabhaga, the Dayatattva and a few other works do not divide dāya into two kinds. According

The meaning of daya

to them, all daya is sapratibandha i, e. ownership arises in another only on the death of the previous owner 1020 or on the cessation of the latter's ownership owing to his becoming patitu or a sannyāsin ( ascetic ). 1001 The doctrine of this school is called uparamasvatvavāda (ownership arising on death), while the school of the Mit. holds the view of janmasvatvavāda. This is the great difference between the school of the Dāyabhāga and that of the Mitākşarā. The former does not recognise that the son, grandson or great-grandson acquires by birth any right of ownership in the ancestral property held by the father or other ancestor. 

The two words 'svu' and ' svāmin'are correlative, the idea underlying both is the same and they are two aspects of the same question. 'Sva' means 'what belongs to a person'i. e. 

property. It has direct reference to a thing and indirect reference to the owner of the thing. Svamin' means 'master or owner and directly refers to the person owning and indirectly to the thing. Vide Salmond's Jurisprudence, chap. XI. pp. 339-340 (9th ed. of 1937) for the idea of ownership. According to Siromanibhattācārya svatra is a separate padārtha (category) by itself, while others say that it is a capacity. 102

1021. It is to be noted that becoming patita entailed loss of the ownership of wealth, even according to Indian writers, only if the proper prayascittas were not performed. For example, the V.P. (p. 429) states are earthaar

The Caste Disabilities Removal Act (XXI of 1850) provides that so much of any.law or usage in force in British India, which inflicts on any person forfeiture of rights of property or may be held to impair or affect any right of inheritance by reason of his renouncing or baving been excluded from the communion of any religion or being deprived of caste, shall cease to be enforced as law in British India. This act, therefore, did away with the effects of being patita without undergoing prayasoitta or of being excommu nicated by a caste for some grave lapse.

History of Dharmaśāstra 

(Vol. 

Since in defining daya the idea of svatva (ownership) was brought in, many of the digests enter upon a learned disquisi tion on the question whether svatva is to be understood from the śāstra alone or is a matter of popular understanding. There is also an ulterior purpose in the minds of some writers in this discussion, viz. that of denying that svatva can arise by more birth. The reasoning of those who say that svatva is to be understood from śāstra alone is as follows: Gaut. (X. 39-42) lays 10% down five sources of ownership common to all viz. riktha ( inheritance), purchase, partition, seizure, fnding (of treasure and the like ) and further states that in the case of brāhmaṇas acceptance of gifts is an additional source of owner ship, conquest in the case of ksatriyas, gain by agriculture and service in the cases of vaisyas and südras respectively. If ownership were to be apprehended from means other than Šāstras, then this text of Gautama laying down sources of ownership that are common to all varnas and that are peculiar to each of the several varnas would serve no useful purpose and would be superfluous. Further Manu (VIII. 340 ) states that if a brāhmaṇa seeks wealth even by teaching or officiating as a priest for a man whom he knows to be a thief, he would be punishable like a thief. If svatva is a matter of popular under standing then this is not proper, since the priest or teacher who obtains the wealth from one who is in possession of stolen things would have to be regarded as guilty of no offence as he merely pursues the methods of earning wealth specially prescribed for him by the smrti texts. Further, if svatva is not to be appre hended from sāstra, such complaints as a thing that belongs to me has been stolen by this man' would not be possible, as svatva being a purely secular matter the thief would himself be (or would have to be deemed to be ) the owner of the thing, because the latter is in possession of it. Thieving is forbidden by śāstra and so on the view of svatva being apprehended from sāstra alone, such a complaint is understandable 1023. Besides eminent

Ownership known from $āstra alone

works and writers like the Smrtisangraha and Dhāreśvara 1024 support the view. Those who hold that svatva is known only from sāstra explain that riktha in Gautama's sūtra means simply dāya and samyibhāga means partition of dāya which establishes the separate ownership of a person on a portion of daya ( vide V. P. p. 415 ).1025 They further urge that Gautama's text does not specifically mention birth as a source of ownership, 

Others headed by the Mit. hold that svatra is apprehended from worldly usage and not from sāstra. Their reasoning is : (1) just as rice effects an ordinary worldly purpose, so svatva brings about worldly transactions such as sale. What is not owned by a man does not enable him to effect such worldly objects and transactions as sale or mortgage. Such matters as the Āhavaniya fire that are prescribed by the śāstras are not useful in effecting secular purposes, but only śāstric ones. The Ahavaniya fire may be used in cooking rice, but that is in virtue of its ordinary nature as fire and not in its sāstric nature of being the Ahavaniya fire. 1026 (2) Even among Mlecchas and lowest peoples who are quite innocent of the knowledge of sās tras, the ideas of ownership arising from transactions of sale and the like do exist. Further (3) learned men well-versed in

1025. When a man dies his wealth is the dāya which several persons may inherit. In their case, it becomes their joint property. So their ownership, being joint, is denoted by the word "riktha'. The joint owners become exclusive owners of definite parts of the daya by partition; thus partition is a source of ownership (in this case exclusive ownersbip of dis tinct parts by several), But if there is a single heir then there can be no samvibhaga (partition) and so the source of his ownership is riktha and not samvibhāga. When there are several heirs riktha is on this view a source of joint ownership only. It must be said that on the hypothesis of Jimūla vābana, riktha and samvibhāga rather coalesce with one another and cannot be distinguished so well as on the theory of the Mit.

the Mimāmsā such as Prabhākara 1027 (on Jaimini IV.1.2) and 

1027. The Mit. (on Yāj. II. 114 ) quotes a passage of Prabhākara on the lipsasutra and explains it. Jaimini's sūtra (IV. 1. 2) is utilitat: 

ET IT F USHTOTSTEHT . In tos sūtra the word lipsā occurs. Therefore this is called lipsāsūtra. The words of FPT T e a fuga m occur in the Dāyabhāga also (11. 67 p. 49) and in Medhātithi on Menu VIII 417. These words are quoted in the Mit. as taken from Prabha kara (called Guru) and so it follows that even Medhātithi quotes from Prabhākara. The earliest extant commentary of Sabara offers three expla pations of this sūtra, which deals with the question of what is kratvartha and what is puruşārtha. The third explanation concerns itself with the rules about acquiring wealth (which is necessary for performing every sacrifice ) such as acceptance of gifts in the case of brāhmanas. The ques. tion is whether these rules about the means of acquiring wealth are krat vartha or puruşārtha. If they are the former (i. e., if they are meant to be directly connected with the sacrifice) then a sacrifice performed with wealth not acquired according to the rules of sāstra will be defective or a nullity. But if the rules are puruşārtba (i. e. addressed to the sacrificer only or to his conscience and sense of dharma) then even if tbe sacrifice is performed with wealth not acquired in accordance with sāstra there will be no defect in the sacrifice itself, only the acquirer will be at fault and may have to perform priyaścitta. Says Sabara : gant ar perature TUTTI Teart

The Mit. points out that in the plausible view (pūrvapakşa) and the established conclusion ( siddhānta) it is assumed that acquisition of wealth by acceptance of gift is a matter known from worldly usage (Lokasiddha). The comment of Prabhākara (called Guru) on this sūtra is not yet available in print. The Sm. C. II. pp. 257-258, the Madanarataa, and V.P. p. 420 quote a passage from the Nayaviveka of Bhavanātha on the same subject and explain it, The Han says 'n ware Targtur i af पा अर्जनं जन्मादि। अत एवानिदंप्रथमलोकधीविषयतया स्थिते नियन्धनार्था (विषयतया tourfuafaqunut!) facular carretera.

The Mahābhāsya (vol. I. p. 483 ) on Pan. II. 3, 50 states that a thing becomes one's own in four ways viz, by purchase, by seizure, by begging or by exchange \#\# When a gorge Tourerat franar.

Ownership is understood from worldly usage 

551 

Bhavanātha, author of the Nayaviveka, hold that ownership which springs from certain fixed sources only (such as purchase) is a matter of worldly usage or experience. Bhavanātha says: the sources of acquisition such as birth and purchase &c. are known from the world. The conception about the sources of ownership was not started for the first time by the śāstra, but such sources have been knowns from times immemorial ( long before the smrtis). That is, the recognition of the sources of ownership is prior and sāstra only systematises them subsequently. There fore the smrti of Gautama (X. 39 ) only assigns their proper spheres to the several sources of ownership that are already well-known (viz. five are common to all, acceptance of gifts is peculiar to brābmanas and so on). In this respect it is like the grammar of Pāṇini. Pāpini does not create or lay down new words but he takes the words already current in the language and introduces a system about their formation. Similarly Gautama only voices a certain fixed system among the several sources of ownership. The Mit, and its followers say that Gautama simply repeats the several sources of ownership known in ordinary worldly life (as the V. Mayūkha says 'lokasiddha kāraṇānuvādakam)'. The Mit., Par. M. III. p. 481, S. V. p. 402 and others hold that riktha and samvibhāga in Gautama's sūtra stand for apratibandha dāya and sapratibandha dāya respec tively. 1028 The Mit. meets the other arguments of its opponents by replying that in the first place that even ordinary popular usage does not recognise that the thief becomes the rightful owner by simply possessing the thing stolen and that in the case where a person says 'this man has stolen my property' there is doubt and dispute whether the man charged has got ownership by purchase or the like. 

The purpose of this discussion of the topic whether owner ship is only known from sāstra or is a secular matter is, accord ing to the Mit., as follows:-Manu XI. 193 ( = Vişņu Dh. 8. 54, 28) states that when brāhmapas acquire wealth by reprehensi. ble actions (such as accepting a gift from an unworthy person or engaging in the sale of articles which he should not sell) 

1028. The word riktha is often used in the sense of sapratibaodba daya also as in Gaut. XII: 37 (rikthabbāja ļņam pratikuryuh) and Yaj. II.51 (riktba grāba raam dāpyab), Baud. (riktham mrtāyaḥ kanyāyāḥ) 9. by the Mit. on Yæj. II. 146. Vide Bai Parson v. Bai Somli 36 Bom. 424 at pp. 428-434 for an exhaustive exposition of the basic principles underlying the two kinds of daya in the Mit. and the Vyavahāra-mayūkha).552

they are purified from the sin by abandoning that wealth, by repeating the sacred texts (like the Gāyatri) and by austerities. If ownership springs from sāstra alone, what is earned by & person in ways condemned by sāstra cannot become the pro perty of that man and so his sons cannot divide what is not his property. But if ownership is deemed to be a secular matter (laukika ) then even what is obtained by condemned means becomes the property of that man, his sons incur no blame (though the acquirer may have to perform penance) and can divide that wealth (which is dāya), since Manu X. 115 enume rates daya among the seven approved sources of wealth. The Madanaratna does not approve of this. Its reason briefly is that Manu XI. 193 simply lays down a penance, but does not say that wealth so obtained does not become the acquirer's pro perty, that it is on account of this that Manu does not prescribe any special fine or punishment for one who acquires wealth by means of a bad gift, as he prescribes for a thief and that what is acquired by theft does not become the property of the thief and his sons cannot divide it and would incur punishment if they do so. V. P. (pp. 423-424) refers to the views of the Mit. and the Madanaratna and approves of the views of the former, 

This discussion leads on to the next question, viz. whether ownership arises from partition or whether partition takes place of what already belongs to oneself (by birth). This subject has exercised the minds of writers on Dharmaśāstra from very ancient times. It should be noted that the difference of opinion relates only to the case of sons, grandsons and great grandsons. All writers are agreed that persons other than these have no rights by birth in the wealth of their relatives. Those who oppose the view that sons acquire right by birth argue as follows: 

If sons have ownership by birth in ancestral property, then, on the birth of a son, the father cannot enter upon such rell gious duties as consecrating Vedic fires (which entail the expenditure of ancestral wealth ) without the consent of the son, This would be opposed to the Vedic injunction "a man, whose hair is yet dark and who has had a son, should consecrate the sacred Vedio fires ". Further, Smrti passages stating that a gift made by the father to one out of several sons as a favour (Nār. dayabhāga 6 ) or by the husband to his wife out of affec tion is not liable to partition would be meaningless, since such gifts cannot be made without the consent of the sons (on the 

Theory of son's right by birth 

553 

theory that sons acquire property by birth). Besides, there are smrti texts like those of Devala 1029 which expressly negative the son's ownership during the father's lifetime. Manu IX. 104 and Nār. ( dagabhāga 2) enjoining that sons should divide wealth after the father goes to heaven (because the sons are not masters when the parents are alive, as Manu says) indicate that sons have no ownership by birth. Moreover svalva is apprehended only from sõstras (like Gautama), which do not expressly enumerate birth as a source of ownership along with purchase and the like. Therefore the ownership of the son or sons arises on the cessation of the ownership of the previous owner (by his death or by his becoming palita or becoming an ascetic). When there is a single son, he inherits on the death of the father and there is no necessity of a partition. But when there are several sons, they jointly inherit paternal wealth and can become exclusive owners of separate parts of the paternal wealth by partition alone. As this last is the most usual case, it is said that suatua arises from partition (vibhagāt svatuam ). If this doctrine that ownership arises by partition alone were literally interpreted, then an only son inheriting his father's property will have no ownership as urged by the Vyavahāra nirņaya, since there can be no partition in his case 1030 

The arguments advanced by those who hold that owner ship in ancestral wealth arises by birth are as follows: 

It has been established that ownership is a matter of ordi nary worldly usage. It cannot be denied that it is quite well known to all ordinary people that sons acquire ownership by birth, Besides there is the text of Gautama 1031 "the acāryas hold that one acquires ownership by birth itself". Moreover there are numerous smrti passages like those of Yāj. II. 121,

XVII.2 which expressly state that in the paternal grandfather's wealth, the father and the son have equal ownership (and so the right of the son must be by birth). Those who uphold the gon's ownership by birth repel the arguments advanced in favour of the opposite theory as follows :--The Vedic text enjoining consecration of Vedio fires at a certain age indicates that the father has the power to spend for religious rites from ancestral wealth even after the birth of a son. Similarly as head of the family and its manager, the father has independent authority to spend ancestral wealth (except immovable property ) for indispensable acts of religious duty expressly enjoined by Vedic and Smrti texts and for making gifts of affection, for maintenance of the family and for ridding the family of distress. Further the father or the manager of the family can dispose of even immovable property by mortgage or sale in a season of distress or for the benefit of the family and for necessary religious purposes such as śrāddhas 1033 etc.) 

: Ownership has to be distinguished from possession and custody. Further ownership is of various kinds, such as corporeal and incorporeal, sole ownership and joint ownership, ownership as trustee and beneficial ownership, vested and contingent. Even Western writers on Jurisprudence like Austin, Pollock and Salmond, find it difficult to define the exact meaning of ownership. Austin (Lecture XLVII) defines

Definition of ownership 

555 

property or dominion as the right to use or deal with some given subject in a manner or to an extent, which though not unlimited, is indefinite. Pollock defines ownership as the entirety of the powers of use and disposal allowed by law. But the idea of ownership does not require, according to Sanskrit works on Dharmaśāstra, that the owner should always be able to do with his property as he pleases. On the contrary the śāstras lay down restrictions on the owner, enjoining upon him not to make gifts to the detriment of his family (vide Yāj. II. 175 "suum kutumbūvirodhena deyam" and the verse of the Smrti sangraha" na ca svamucyale" quoted in note 963 above ). Therefore property does not comprise only what one can dispose of at one's sweet will, but what is capable (in appropriate circumstances only ) of being disposed of as one 1034 likes. A person may be prevented from dealing with his property as he likes by the king or by the rules of sāstra, by public opinion, by his own inclinations and by the pressure of those around him. But what he owns is theoretically capable of being dis posed off by him as he liker. The Madanaratna puts forth the illustration that seeds kept dry in a granary do not sprout, yet they have the capacity of sprouting and so are as well denominated seeds as others that sprout. There are various grades of the limitations on property, such as the father's power, the widow's power and so on. What a person earns should belong to him, should be his property. But there are passages like Manu VIII. 416 and Nār. ( abhyupetyāśuśrüşā, verse 41 ) that state 1035 "three are declared to be without wealth viz. the wife, the son and the slave; whatever they earn is for him to whom they (wife, son and slave ) belong.". It has been stated

by such an ancient writer as Sabara-svāmin 1026 that this passage does not deny the ownership of the wife or son in what she or he earns, but is only intended to lay down that the wife or son cannot independently (without the consent of the husband or father ) dispose of what she or he earns. This view of the text of Manu is accepted by the Dayabhāga as well as by the Mitāk şarī School. The latter holds on the analogy of the interpreta tion of Manu VIII. 416 that the texts of Devala, Nār. and Manu IX. 104 which apparently deny ownership ( svāmya ) 1037 to the son during the father's lifetime over property in the hands of the father are to be interpreted only as denying the gon's power of independent dealing with such property during the father's lifetime or as referring to the self-acquisitions of the father. On the other hand the Diyabhāga and the Dāyatattva try to explain away such passages as those of Yāj. II. 121, Vişnu and others (quoted above) that speak of the son's ownership by birth. The Dāyabhāga offers two explanations of Yaj. II. 121. 1038 The first explanation offered by it and taken from Udyota is : If A has two sons B and C of whom dies first, leaving a son D and then A dies, then Yāj. says that both B (son of A) and D (grandson of A) will be equally entitled to the wealth left by A and not B alone, though he is nearer to A than D, because both B and D offer pindas of the same efficacy to A in the pārvapa-srāddha and so there should be no difference between the two. The words "sadrśam svāmyam "refer to this equality of the son and grandson. The 2nd explanation is that of

Équal ownership of futher and son 

557 

Dhāreśvara viz. that when the father desires to make a parti. tion, he may distribute his self-acquired property as he likes among his sons, but as to the property he got from his own father (i, e. the grandfather of his sons ) he has the same ownership that sons have and he cannot make an unequal division at his sweet will. The Dayabhāga 1039 rejects the view that Yaj. II. 121 enables the son to demand partition of the grand-father's property from the father even against the will of the latter or that father and son have equal shares in the grandfather's property. The same remarks apply to the texts of Vişnu and others viz. that in the grandfather's property father and son are equally owners and that the words " tulyam syāmyam" or "samamamgitvam" do not mean that father and son take the same share therein. 

From the above discussion it will be clear that the two schools of the Dayabhāga and of the Mitākşarā were not started by them for the first time, but each had respectable antiquity behind it. Smrtis like those of Manu, Nārada and Devala and eminent authors like Udyota and Dhāreśyara had put forward the doctrine of uparana-svatvavūda, while the Smstis of Yaj., Vişnu, Bp, espoused the doctrine of janmasvatuavāda. Viśvarūpa who commented on Yāj. (in the first half of the 9th century ) holds that ownership arises by birth 1040 The Mitakşarā further supports that theory by citing a sutra of Gautama (utpatlyaiva etc.) which is not found in the extant Gautama-dharma-sútra. This sūtra does not occur in Aparārka and several other works and is stated by Srikṛspa Tarkālankāra (on Dāyabhāga I. 21 p. 14) to be not authoritative (amülı). These facts emboldened Dr. Jolly to go so far as to make the facile suggestion that it was fabricated by Vijñānesvara or his predecessors (Tagore Law Lectures p. 110 ). We have seen that so early a writer as Viśvarüpa was excited over the question whether ownership arises on partition or by birth. The learned Doctor has failed to note that the ancient commentator Medbātithi ( about 900 A, D.) favoured the view of ownership by birth and quotes (without name) the gūtra in a slightly different form (on Manu

It has to be noted that the Dayabhāga 1042 does admit that in some (texts ?) ownership is stated to arise by birth itself (kvucit janmanaiveti ) and it explains that the words are not to be taken literally, but that birth is said to be the source in an indirect way, as the relation of father and son is based upon birth and on the death of the father the son's ownership arises (therefore though ownership directly arises on death, birth may be said to be the source of it as the son is the first heir because of his being born as a son to the father). The Dayatattva does not say that the sutra of Gautama is not authoritative, but explains it away on lines similar to those of the Dāyabhāga. It may be stated here briefly that the Dāyablāga differs from the Mitākşarı in four main points :-(1) The Dayabhāga denies the theory that property is by birth, while the Mit, accepts it; (2) the Dayabhāga lays down that the right to inherit and the order of heirs is determined by the principle of religious efficacy, while the Mit. school holds that blood relationship is the gover ning factor in this matter; (3) the Dayabhāga holds that members of a joint family (such as brothers or cousing) hold their shares in quasi-severalty and can dispose of them even when there is no partition by metes and bounds; (4) the Daya bhāga holds that even in an undivided family the widow succeeds

to her husband's share on his death without male issue, while the Mit. school holds that she does not do so. 

Various attempts have been made to explain why in Bengal alone the laws of succession and inheritance should diverge materially from the laws prevailing in the rest of India. In two learned papers 'on the origin and development of the Bengal school of Hindu Law'contributed to the Law Quarterly Review (vol. XXI for 1905 pp. 380-392 and vol. XXII for 1906 pp. 50-63) Mr. Justice Saradacharan Mitra tries at some length to advance a theory of his own; The commercial spirit of the newly formed nation in the eastern corner of the Indian peninsula with its deltaic character and nearness to the sea, the new ideas which other nations trading with it were bringing in every day, the necessary admixture of races in some parts of the country, the religion of Buddha which for centuries was here the religion of the sovereign as well as of the people and the influence of the Buddhistic tantras combined to bring about a law of property dissimilar in material respects from the rules propounded by Brahmanical sages of old and explained and commented upon in the Mitākşarā and the books based on the same'. His idea is that, as Buddhism profoundly affected the position of women and as tantras like the Mahānirvāņa sub scribed to the exaltation of the feminine element in nature, the ancient law of property, particularly in relation to women, came to be affected and conceptions of individual ownership, of freedom from restrictions on alienation and of the rights of females arose in Bengal which were incorporated by Jimüta vāhana in his Dayabhāga. With the greatest respect to the learned writer, it must be said that the grounds he urges are far from convincing. A thorough examination of his thesis cannot be undertaken here for want of space. But a few remarks must be made. As regards maritime activity the West coast of India was far more in touch with seafaring and com merce with the West than even Bengal, as the mention of the ports of Barugaza (Broach) and Kalliéné (modern Kalyan) by Greek writers, the finding of hoards of Roman coins and the existence of Syrians on the West Coast clearly establish. Bud dhism had spread to central and western India as early (if not earlier than) the period when it could have spread to Eastern Bengal and Assam. Sanchi, Bhilsa, Bharhut, the Nasik and Karla caves bear eloquent testimony to the influence of Bud dhism in central and western India for centuries before and after the Christian era. Besides as Mr. Justice Mitra himself

(Vol. 

admits 'Buddhism had not its own law of property (Law Quarterly Review vol. XXI p. 388). Buddhist countries like Burma themselves borrowed their laws of succession and inheri tance from the Manusmrti. Vijñānešvara is far more liberal to women than Jimūtavāhana, who does not allow any woman to suoceed as heir unless she is expressly mentioned as an heir in the smrti texts. The Mahanirvana-tantra treats a sister and stepmother as near heirs and allows even a paternal uncle's widow and son's daugther to succeed; but under the Dayabhāga these are not at all heirs. One branch of the Mitakşarā school, viz. that of the V, Mayūkha in Western India is far more liberal about the claims of women than any school. The Marumak katayam and Aliyasantan law in force in some districts of South India and among certain communities like the Nambudri brahmaṇas and Nairs go to the other extreme in their regard for women but no one has so far traced that law to Buddhist or Tantric influence. The peculiarity of the Dayabhāga, viz. the principle of religious efficacy is far more remote froin rules of affinity given in the Mahānirvāņa-tantra than the principle of consanguinity espoused by the Mitākşarā school. Mr. Justice Mitra is wrong in his estimate of the age of Jimütavāhana. As stated above (on p. 557 ) Jimātavāhana relies on authors like Udyota and the smrtis of Devala and others. It is best to admit that no satisfactory explanation can be given of the peculiar dootrines of the Dayabhāga. They have an indigenous and independent origin and growth. 

Vibhāga (partition) is defined by the Mit. 1043 as the allot ment to individuals of definite portions of aggregates of wealth over which many persons have joint ownership. The Dāyabhāga found several faults with this definition, the principal criticism being that it is cumbrous and farfetched to assume that the ( joint) ownership of several (sons and the like) is first pro duced in the entire wealth of the father and then to hold that this joint ownership is subsequently destroyed. Its own defini tion is: “ Vibhāga means the indication of the ownership (of one out of many ) by the casting of a ball or pebble ( on a defi nite part of the land or cash), which (ownership) arises with

reference to a portion only (of the heritage of land and cash ), but which is indefinite because it is not possible (for one man) to deal specifically with a particular portion (of the heritage ) since there is nothing to show for certain what portion belongs to whom". The Dāyabbāga denies that owner ship jointly arises in all co-sharers ( before partition) over every portion of the heritage and states that it arises in portions of it but there is no certain indication to show which part be longs to whom and that the portion of each is made definite and ascertained by partition effected by casting a ball or pebble on a portion (saying this is A's exclusive portion' eto.). The Dāyatattva 1044 (p. 163 ) criticizes this definition. If before partition each of the co-heirs has ownership in part only of the entire heritage, what assurance is there that the allotment of a part to one co-heir by means of casting a ball will be as to the same portion over which his ownership arose before the parti. tion? The Dāyatattva, though differing 1045 from the Mit. as to the doctrine of ownership by birth, agrees with it as to the definition of vibhāga. The differing definitions of yibhāga given by the Mit, and the Dāyabhāga lead to different results. Under the Mit. when there is a joint family of father and sons or grand sons, all these are coparceners and the ownership of the coparconary property is in the whole body of coparceners i, e. there is unity of ownership while the family remains joint, no coparcener can say that he is owner of a definite share, one fourth or one fifth etc. A coparcener's interest is fluctuating, is capable of being enlarged by deaths and is liable to be diminished by births. It is only on partition that a coparcener becomes entitled to a definite share. On the other hand accord ing to the Dāyabhāga there is no ownership by birth, the sons on the father's death constitute a coparcenary but the owner ship of the family property is not in all the sons as a body. Every son takes a defined sbare, the moment the ownership of the father ceases ( owing to death eto.). The share so taken does not fluctuate with births and deaths. The sons are coparceners in the sense that their possession of the property

inherited from the father is joint i. e, there is unity of passession, though there is no unity of ownership. 

According to the Mitaksarā sons take by birth an interest in ancestral estate. Suppose A is sole owner of an ancestral estate and has no issue. In that case there is no coparcenary. But the moment a son is born to him, a coparcenary is started. That is, under the Mitakşarā the birth of a son starts a coparcenary. Under the Dāyabhāga there is no coparcenary between father and sons as the latter acquire no rights by birth even in ancestral property but it may subsist between brothers or uncles and nephews. Under the Dāyabhāga, the death of a man may start a coparcenary among his sons ( who will be brothers ). 

Partition has two senses, (1) division by metes and bounds and (2) separation or severance in interest. Under the Mitakşarā it is possible to have partition in both these senses. The members of a coparcenary may define, at a particular moment, the shares that each would be entitled to; but the actual division of property by metes and bounds may be postponed to a future date and in the intervening period they may enjoy the property in common as before. This is clearly brought out by the Vyavahāramayükha 1046 when it says “ even in the absence of joint (family ) property severance (of interest ) takes place also by a mere declaration in the form 'I am separate from thee'; for severanoe is merely a particular mode (or state) of the mind and this declaration merely manifests that (state or mode of the mind )". The S. V. (p. 347 ) has a similar passage. It is here stated that an unequivocal declaration of intention to separate effects the severance of a member from the joint family and that it is not absolutely necessary that there should be any joint property or that the property be divided by metes and bounds. This last follows as a matter of course when there is a severance of interest. This proposition has been accept ed by the Privy Council 1047 and this passage of the Vyavahara

How separation may be effected 

563 

mayükha has been quoted in several cases. What constitutes an unequivocal declaration of intention to separate has as usual given rise to a good deal of case law which has to be passed over here. Under the Dayabhāga heirs succeed on the death of the previous owner in certain definite shares and therefore parti tion has ordinarily only the first sense viz. assigning to the coparceners specific portions of the property inherited. Another way of separating a member 1018 is also mentioned by Manu IX. 207 and Yāj. II. 116, viz. that when a member of the family is able to fare for himself and does not desire to have a share in the family property, he should be separated by giving him some trifle ( as a token). The Mit. adds that the trifle is given as a piece of evidence to prevent his sons claiming a share later on. 

The principal matters to be discussed under Dayabhāga or Dāyavibhaga are, as stated by the Sangraha and the Mit., four, viz. the time of partition, the property liable to partition, the mode of partition and the persons entitled to partition 1049, 

Time for partition. The evolution of the son's right to demand a partition has been a process of ages. It would not be out of place to say a few words on this topic here. In most primitive societies where the patriarchal family system prevail ed, the father had absolute power over the son, it was the son's duty to obey the father, alienation of family property was not allowed, the father had power over the acquisitions of all persons including the son and women were incompetent to hold property. Faint traces of these can be detected in the Vedio literature. The legend of Sunaḥśepa narrated in the Ait. Br. ( 33. 1 ff), where we are told that Ajigarta sold his son for being offered as a victim to Varuņa, that Višvāmitra adopted Sunahsepa as his son, though he had already a hundred and one sons, and that he cursed and disinherited his fifty sons for their disobedience to

his order, indicates that in the days of the Ait. Br. it was believed that in hoary ages long before it, the father's power over his song was absolute. But & caution is necessary. It is possible to over-emphasize the legend of Sunahsepa ; it has to be remember ed that it is a mere legend and that the Ait. Br. itself shows that the conduct of Ajigarta was condemned as most unworthy of a decent nan even according to the legend. 1850 In modern times there are rare instances where parents insure their children and then poison them or maim them for earning the insurance money. But no one says that this is usual or that modern law allows it. In Rg. I. 117. 17 it is stated that the eyes of Rjrāśva were put out by his father because the former gave a hundred rams to a she-wolf. This is a solitary instance and it is probable that the verse has some esoteric meaning or refers to some terrestrial or celestial phenomenon. In the Kathaka Samhita XI. 4 it is said "the father rules over the son" (pita putrasyese). But it must be said that ideas about the father's absolute power over the sons lingered on in historio times. The Nir. (in III 4 ) puts forward the argument of some predecessors that daughters did not suoceed to the father's wealth because women could be donated, sold or abandoned and not men, while others said that males also were liable to the same treatment as evidenced by the story of Sunaḥsepa. 1051 Vasiştha (XV.%) states that 1052 father and mother have power to make a gift or sale of the son or to abandon him. We saw above ( n 1035 ) that Manu stated that a son's earnings belonged to his father. The Ap. Dh. 8. (II. 6. 13. 10-11 ) emphatically says that the right to give away or sell one's child is not recognized and that the word "sale" used in connection with a bride is used only metaphorically. About the word "sale" in relation to marriage vide H. of Dh. vol. II. pp. 503-506. 

On the other hand even in the Rg. we find that sons divided the father's property during his lifetime when the father grew old, "O Agail men worship you in many places in various ways; they take ( from you ) wealth as from an aged father"

Drivision in father's lifetime 

565 

(Rg. I. 70.5). 1053 .In the Ait. Br. (22.9) the story of Nabhane diştha 1054, the youngest son of Manu, shows that the elder brothers divided all the father's property among themselves, and excluded Nabhanedistha during the father's lifetime appa rently without any protest from him or in spite of it. In the Tai. S. III. 1. 9. 4-51055 the version of the same story is different, since it is there said that Manu himself divided his wealth among his sons and did not give any share of the paternal wealth to Nabhānediştha who was away at a teacher's house as a vedic student. In the Gopatha Brahmana (IV. 17 ) it is said "therefore in their childhood sons subsist on their father, while in his advancing years the father subsists on the son". In the Sat. 1056 Br. (8. B. E. vol. 44, p. 157 ) we read "whence in early life the sons subsist on the father...whence in later life, the father subsists on his sons". In the Kausītaki Br. Upanisad (II. 15) after describing the symbolical handing over to the son of all his physical and mental powers by a father who is expecting death it is said that if after this rite the father recovers he has either to remain under the son's dominion or go out as a wanderer (a sannyasin). 1057 From some of the above passages, it appears that in rare cases sons divided paternal wealth even during the lifetime of the father and against his will. The remark of Dr. Jolly that " it may be unlesitatingly set down as a fact that in the earliest period of Indian Law, partition of property was an entirely unknown proceeding" ( Tagore Law Lectures p. 90) goes too far and is not fully warranted by Vedic texts. Just as the Tai. S. (III: 1. 9.4) 1058 narrates that Manu distributed his wealth among his sons, it also speaks of the eldest son being established with ancestral

wealth. The Ap. Dh, 8. (II. 6. 14. 6 and 10-12) refers to both these passages of the Tai. S. but concludes that equal division among song is the proper mode and that giving a major part of the estate to the eldest alone is forbidden by the sõstras 1059. These lead to the conclusion that equal distribution among all song was believed to be the rule and giving the major portion to the eldest son was an exception (and a rare case ) even in the Vedic age. The Ait. Bộ. ( 19.3) speaks of the right 1060 of Indra to primogeniture ( jyaişthya ) and pre-eminence ( sraişthya). This right of the eldest son to special treatment at the time of partition persisted in the times of Manu (IX. 112 ff) and Yāj. (II. 114) also and even in modern times it is recognized to some extent in the case of impartible estates and even in ordinary families on the ground of custom or from the nature of the grants made by the former Goveroments or the British Government (such as Jaghirs and Saranjams). Both Kaut. and Kāt, declare that customs of countries, castes, villages and groups varying rules of partition and inheritance should be enforced by the king 1061, Dr Jolly (ibid. p. 98) further relies on the faot that the Apastamba dharmasūtra mentions no other kind of partition than that made by the father. But this is far from conclusive. Apas 

tamba was a great purist and idealist. He ignores several matters which are wellknown to have existed long before his time. For example, he takes no notice of the several kinds of secondary song and he does not allow a brāhmaṇa to take up a weapon even for examining it except when he is murderously attacked (I. 10. 29. 7-8), while Manu ( VIII. 345-349 ), Gautama VII. 6 and 25 and others allow a brāhmaṇa much greater latitude. Therefore Apastamba's silence cannot lead to the positive conclusion of the absence of any other method of partition. As 

· a matter of fact, Gautama (15, 19 ) who is generally regarded as prior to Apastamba states that brāhmaṇas that had separated from their fathers against the latter's will were not fit to be

Partition against father's will

invited for dinner at a śrāddha. 1062 That shows that partition of Bons from the father against the father's will was wellknown long before Gautama. Dr. Jolly also ( ibid p. 90 ) relies on an anonymous smrti text ( quoted by the Mit. in its introduction to Yāj. II. 114 ) which absolutely prohibits the sale of land. But this is irrelevant. The text could not be taken literally when we have seen that sales of land have been taking place for at least two thousand years. All that the text means is that a sale should be clothed in the form of a gift 1063. Similarly the few smrti passages that include lands and houses among indivisible properties are to be explained as having in view the fragmentation of a field into small uneconomio plots or holdings or the division of a single small house among numerous co sharers. It is impossible to bolieve that the texts meant that houses could never be partitioned among co-heirs. All that we can reasonably infer is that as a general rule such partitions were looked upon with disfavour by society. One may concede that this sentiment continued long after even Gautama and Apastamba and even in the 20th century a Hindu son suing his father for partition incurs great opprobrium. 

Apart from the inference to be drawn from some of the Vedic passages quoted above, it follows that partition did take place, though probably rarely, during the father's lifetime and even against his will, as indicated by Gautama's dictum. It is now to be seen what the smrtis and the medieval writers say about the time of partition. One time was when the father divided the property among his sons during his lifetime as evidenced by the Tai, S. III, 1. 9. 4, Ap. Dh. S. II. 6. 14, 1, Gaut. 28.2, Baud. Dh.S. II. 2.8, Yaj. II. 114, Nār, dāyabhāga 4. Another time was after the death of the father (Gaut. 28. 1, Manu IX. 104, Yāj. II. 117, Nār. dāyabhāga 2).

ownership (by death or renunciation of the world as an asoetic or because he has lost all desires) and during the father's life time at his own desire. The V. P. (pp. 429 and 434, 435) strongly criticizes the Dayabhaga as to these two. Some writers like Jimütavāhana went so far as to hold that even though the father be dead there should be no partition among the sons during their mother's life 1065. The Mit. (following Gaut. 28. 1-2) indicates three principal times for partition, 1065 viz. (1) at the father's desire during his lifetime, (2) when the father has lost all desire for worldly goods, desists from sexual intercourse and the mother is past the age of child-bearing, partition may take place at the desire of the song even against the wish of the father (Gaut. 28.2,Nar. dayabhaga3,Br. S. B.E. 33 p. 369 verse 1); (3) after the death of the father. The Mit. relying on Sankha's 1067 text adds that even though the mother may not be past child-bearing, yet the sons can partition at

The Dayabhāga (I. 32-33 p. 18) reads पिनटे पाप्यशरणे and explains विनष्टे पतिते अशरणे गृहस्थाश्रमरहिते. The ग्य. प्र. (p. 433) reads निवृत्ते चापि रमणात् and हलायुध also read it so (V. R. p. 462). The दायभाग (I. 47, p. 24) says दनासु भगिनी बेतिन कालार्थ कि त तासामवश्यं दानार्थम्.

their desire, even against the father's will if the father pursues an immoral or irreligious mode of life or is afflicted with a chronic disease or is very old. Nār. ( dāyabbāga 16 ) is similar. It should not be supposed that the Mit. holds that there are only three times for partition; according to it there are other times also (as in the text of Sankha quoted by it). This is made clear by the V. P. p. 434. The Dāyabhāga reads the text of Sankha-Likhita differently and takes it to mean that as long as the father is alive there can be no partition against his will even if he be very old or suffering from a chronic disease or has not all his wits about him, and tbat in such a contingency the eldest son or with his consent the next younger brother who is capable may manage the family affairs. The Daya bhāga quotes a similar passage of Hārita (which is also quoted by the Madanaratna, the Vyavahāramayūkha and other digests ). On account of the remarks of the Mit. some works like the Madanapārijāta (pp. 645 ff) speak of four times for partition, viz. during the father's lifetime at his choice (Yaj. II. 114), even against his will when the mother is past child-bear ing and the father is free from all sexual desires and does not care for wealth (Nār, dāyabhāga 3), when the father is old or follows the path of adharma or suffers from an incurable disease then even against his will (relying on Sankha 88 quoted in the Mit.), and after the father's death. The V. Nir. (p. 408) is almost of the game view. 

The Mitakşarā is quite clear on the point that the son has an absolute right of partition of ancestral property during his father's lifetime even against the father's wish. The discussion in the Mitākşarā may be briefly set out here. In Vāj. II. 120 (latter half ) it is stated that in the case of grandsons the parti tion is according to (or through ) the fathers i. e. it is per stirpes and not per capita. The text of Yāj. (anekapitīkānām 1068 tu pitȚto bhāgakalpanā ) is explained by the Mitakşars in this way that although sons and grandsons have rights of ownership by birth in the grandfather's property, yet when each of several sons dies leaving a differing number of sons (one leaves two, another three and so on) or when some sons are alive and others die leaving their own sons, then partition takes place "per stirpes i, e. the grandsons born of a particular deceased son

get among themselves the share which their deceased father would have got If living i. e. grandsons appear to get partition of property through the son (their father) and not directly by themselves. On this a doubt arises as follows:--If the father of several song is separated from his brothers as to the grand father's property or if the father has no brother and is joint with his father (i. e. the grandfather of the grandson) the grandson cannot demand & share in the grandfather's wealth (since Yāj. II. 120 has been explained as meaning that when the father is dead then the assignment of shares among grandsons is according to the share of the father). Another doubt is: even if a partition can be had by the grandsons in these cases it will be only if the father so desires. To this the Mit. replies emphatically 1069 that in the grandfather's property the owner ship of father and son is wellknown in the world and therefore partition (in the above two cases of doubt) does take place. The Mit. further on expressly says that even when the mother is not past child-bearing and the father still cares for wealth and worldly affairs, partition of grandfather's wealth does take place at the desire of the son even if the father is unwilling. The Mit makes it clear that the rule of division per stirpes is a special rule laid down by the texts (vācaniki vyavastha) for a special case and that in other cases the primary rule of owner ship by birth applies. From Manu IX. 209 the Mitaksarā further draws the inference that even against the father's wish & son can demand partition of property acquired by the grand father. This is the modern Hindu Law in the Mitākşarā school generally recognised by the Courts in British India. In Apaji Narhar 1070 v. Ramchandra a majority of the Full Bench of the

Son's right to partition 

591 

Bombay High Court held that a son cannot in the lifetime of his father sue his father and uncles for a partition of the family property and for possession of his share therein, when the father does not assent to such a suit, although the son has a right by birth in ancestral property. The other High Courts have dissented from this view of the majority of the Bombay Full Bench and have followed the dissenting judgment of Telang J. 1071, 

When the son's right of ownership by birth in ancestral property came to be recognised by such smộtis as that of Yaj., it followed as a logical consequence that any person who acquires a right by birth can demand partition and separate possession of his share at any time. It has been already seen that even before Gautama sons separated from their father against his will, but this was condemned by the sages and obloquy and infamy attached to such conduct. Some of the smrtis recognised the son's right to partition even in the father's lifetime under great restrictions. More than fifteen centuries passed (from Gautama to the Mitākşarā) before the son's right to separate from his father during the latter's lifetime and against his desire was clearly, ungrudgingly and emphatically recognized. The Viramitrodaya also clearly recognizes this right of the son. But even among writers that generally follow the Mit. there were some that could not bring themselves to admit this right of the son. For example, the Madanapārijāta (p. 662) asserts that merely at the will of the son there can be no partition. Under the Dāyabhāga, these questions cannot arise, as the son has no right by birth in ancestral property. 

This evolution of the son's right to demand partition even during the father's lifetime received a fillip from certain reli gious sentiments entertained in ancient times. Gaut. (28.4) remarks that if, instead of remaining united, brothers separate there is increase of spiritual merit (vibhāge tu dharmavrddhiḥ). Manu IX, 111 states" they (the brothers) may stay united or may stay separate if they desire an increase of dharma; by living separate dharma increases; therefore separation is meritorious ".1072

This shows that there was an option either to remain joint after the father's death or to become separate. Sankha-Likhita say that brothers may stay together since being united they will prosper (materially ), 1073 Bř. provides that in the case of members of a joint family that live together and have a common kitchen the worship of gods, Manes and brahmaņas is single for all, while when thoy become separate such worship will be separately carried on in each house. 1074 Nār. ( dāyabhāga 37 ) lays down that when brothers are undivided the performance of religious acts is single for all of them but when there is a partition, the religious acts are separately performed by each. Dharma means here mainly such religious acts as the performance 1075 of the five great daily sacrifices (pañca mahāyajñas ). When the family is joint, worship of gods, Vaišvadeva, honouring of family guests are only single for the whole family and all participate in the spiritual benefits derived from such aots, but when the members become separate, each performs these reli gious acts separately. Manu III. 67 lays down that each house holder has to perform with the gȚhya fire kindled at the time of marriage all grhya rites such as morning and evening offerings, the five great saorifices and the daily cooking of food. The Sangraha seems to have held that dharna refers to the perfor mance of agnihotra, but the Sm. C. II. p. 259 and V.P.( 437-438) do not accept this and hold that even when joint any coparcener can perform all srauta and smārta rites like agnihotra with the help of the undivided joint estate and so dharma means only the worship of gods and Manes and the honouring of guests.

Partition during minority 

513 

Partition was generally made when all the coparceners were major, 1077 but from Kauț. (III. 5), Baud. Dh. S. (II. 2. 42) and Kāt. (844-45) it appears that the minority of a coparcener did not operate as a bar to partition. Kaut. (III. 5) says 'partition takes place when the persons separating bave attained majority; but ( the separating coparceners) should keep in the custody of the mother's relatives of those coparceners who are minorg or of the elders of the village the share of the minors after all debts of the family are paid off, till the minor coparconers attain majority. The same rule applies to a member (of a joint family) that has gone abroad'. Baud. employs almost the same words. Kāt. provides “partition is ordained among coparceners who have attained (years of) understanding of worldly affairs and in the case of males they attain this understanding at the 16th year. The property ( share in joint family estate ) of those who have not attained years of discretion, being made free from expenses ( debts etc.), should be kept (by the other major copar ceners) with the relatives or friends of the minor members, The same should be done to the share of those who have gone abroad.” This shows that partition could take place even when some members of the family were minors and even a single member could demand at his will a partition of his share as expressly stated by the Dayabhāga (II. 16-17), the V. P, and other works 1078. There is a controversy among commentators whether minority terminated at the beginning or end of the 16th year. Nār. IV. 35 states 1079 that a person is a minor (bāla) till the 16th year. From a verse ( attributed to Angiras by Mit. on Yaj. III. 243 and quoted without name by Haradatta on Gaut. II, 6) it appears that one was to be regarded as a būla till

the beginning of the 16th year. 1090 A verse of Kat. appears to hold that minority ends at the beginning of the 16th year; many commentators also hold this view, but several such as Haradatta (on Gaut. X. 48), V. R p. 599, V. P. p. 263 expressly state that minority ends at the end of the 16th year. 1081 It may be stated that according to Gaut. X. 48-49, Manu VIII. 27, Vas. 16. 8, Vispu Dh. S. III. 65 the king was to guard the property of minors, women and helpless people. In modern times under the Indian Majority Act (Act IX of 1875 ) the age of majority is 18 (or 21 in certain cases only) except in matters of marriage, dower, divorce and adoption. In these last matters the ancient Hindu Law will apply to Hindus 1081a. Similarly a partition could be made even though the wife of a coparcener was pregnant. It was therefore that Vas. 17. 41 advised postponing partition till the delivery of the pregnant wives of coparceners, or Yaj. II. 122 and Manu IX. 216 provide for a son born after partition between father and sons. 

The next question is what property is liable to be partitioned. A few preliminary remarks on property must be made here. Property is generally divided by most smrtis into two kinds, sthāvara ( immovable, such as lands and houses ) and jangama (movable). For example, Br. (S. B. E. vol. 33 p. 323 verse 17 ) and Kāt. (516) speak of both kinds of property as subjects of pledges or mortgages. There is another classification in Yaj, II. 121 and a few other smộtis yiz, property is of three kinds.

Sometimes however the word "dravya" is employed in the sense of all property, whether movable or immovable, as in Bp. ( dravye pitamahopātte jangame sthāvare tatha ) quoted in note 1032 above. Property, according to ancient Hindu Law,

The word "aibandha" means a periodic payment or allowance in cash or kind permanently granted by a king, a corporation or a village or a caste to a person, a family, a math or a temple, The Mit. (on Yāj. I. 318 and II. 121) explains it as a delivery or payment of so many leaves (of betel or the like) on each bundle of leaves or so many rupees on each load of merchandise or so many betelnuts on each load of betelnuts; the Sm. C. explains it as the wealth to be obtained under the order or direction of a king or other authority that dealers in commodities should pay every year or month a certain amount to a certain brāhmana or shrine; the V. Mayūkba (p. 28) explains "wbat is granted by a king or the like, to be obtained at. fixed times from mines and the like" and on p. 131 paraphrases it as *yrtti". Nibandha is rendered as corrody by Colebrooke in his Digest, but as observed by the Privy Council in Fattehsangji ». Desai Kallianraiji L. R. 1. I. A. 34 at p. 51 it is not a very happy rendering. In Ghelabhai v. Hargovan 36 Bom. 94 (at p. 101) the explanation of nibandha by the V, Mayükha is construed as conveying that it is not tbe king alone who can make a grant of a aibandha and it is held that the office of a hereditary priest (yajamāna-vriti) is a nibandha and ranks as immovable property, Bombay Regulation V of 1827, section 1, clause 1 includes hereditary offices among immovable property. Vide Collector of Thana v. Krishna. nath 5 Bom. 322 at pp. 331-32 (for a discussion of what is included in nibandha), Collector of Thana v. Hari 6 Bom. 546 (F. B.) at pp. 555-559, Lakshmandas v.

History of Dharmasāatra 

[Vol. 

may be divided into two classes, (1) joint family property, (2) separate property. Joint family property is either ancestral property or property jointly acquired 1083 with or without the aid of ancestral property or property acquired separately but thrown into the common stock (Manu IX, 204 ). The Mit. on Yāj. I. 120 states among unseparated brothers, if the common stook be improved or augmented by one of them through agri culture, trade or similar means, an equal distribution neverthe 1088 takes place and a double share is not allotted to the acquirer.' This contains the doctrine of merger of estate by blending. Vide Shibaprasad v. Prayag Kumari L. R. 59 I. A. 331 = 34 Bom. L. R. 1567. Ancestral property (apratibandha dāya ) is all property inherited by a male from his father, paternal grandfather or paternal great-grandfather, in which according to the Mit. School, the sons, grandsons and great-grandsons 1084 of the person who inherits it acquire an interest by birth. Sepa rate property also includes what is called self-acquired property (svārjita ), which will be discussed a little later on. If a person obtains & share of ancestral property on partition, it has been held that it is his separate property if he has no son, grandson or great-grandson, but if there be any of these then it is ancestral property in his hands so far as he and any of his male descen dants are concerned. Under the Dāyabhāga, as the son does not acquire ownership by birth in ancestral property, there is hardly any distinction between ancestral property and separate property so far as the father's powers of alienation are concerned. A few of the outstanding features of the Dayabhāga system have already been set out above and some may be discussed later.

But other writers like the author of the Viramitrodaya quoted above in note 1069 mention the great-grandson as having a right by birth and this has been accepted by the courts. The words "ancestral property" have a technical son se viz, it is paitamaha i, o, paternal grandfather's or great-grandfather's property. Vide Muhammad Husain v. Kishwa Nandan 64 1. A. 250 where this is made clear. Ia a recent case from Patna, 23 Patoa 599 (F. B.), it has been held that, where a grandfather makes a gift of his self-acquired property to his son (the father), the son or sons of the latter can treat it as ancestral property and take an interest in it by birth unless the gift makes it clear that it was made exclusively for the donee's benefit oply,. . :

Kinds of separate property 

577 

A person while he is a member of a joint Hindu family under the Mit. and has an interest in joint family property may have separate property of his own acquired in various ways. The different sources of ownership have been already mentioned above (pp. 317 and 548). The different kinds of separate property are mainly these: (1) property taken as obstructed heritage, that is, property inherited from any person other than the father, father's father or father's father's father (such as a brother, uncle etc.) 1085 ; (2) a gift of a small portion of ancestral mov able property made through affection by the father to his issue (smộti quoted by Mit.) 1086; (3) gift or bequest of separate pro perty made by the father 1087 to his sons; (4) gifts and bequests made by other relations and friends and gifts at the time of marriage; (5) ancestral property lost to the family and recovered from a stranger by a member of a joint family with his own efforts without assistance from joint family property; (6) sepa rate earnings and gains of learning or science (vilyādhana). A. few remarks will be made on some of these in the sequel. 

It is a remarkable fact that the smrti texts on separate property do not expressly mention gifts received from strangers by a member of a joint family as the separate property of that particular member. The only gifts mentioned are those from friends, or those received at the time of marriage ( called audva hika in Yāj. II. 118 and Manu IX 206 ) or at a madhuparka in 

1085. A decision of the P, C, from Madras held that property inhe rited by two brothers living as members of a joint family from their maternal grandfather became joint property in their hands with rights of survivorship. Vide Venkayyamma v. Venkataramanayamma L. R, 29 1. A. 156. See 27 Mad 300 (F. B.) and 29 All. 667 for the difficulties caused by L. R. 29 I, A. 156. But it may be taken that even in Madras such property inherited from the maternal grandfather will now be held to be the separate property of the two brothers. Vide Muhammad Husain Khan v. Kishva Nandan Sahai L. R. 64 I. A. 250 which explains away (on pp. 264-265 ) the case of L. R. 29 I. A. 156.

honour of a learned man, a priest etc. It is probable that gifts from strangers to a member of the joint family that did not fall within the several classes of separate property mentioned above belonged to the whole family. The concept of the separate property of a member of a joint family was of slow growth. Originally all property however acquired by any member might have been held to belong to the whole family. This is indicated to some extent by Manu VIII. 416, which was ( as shown above on pp. 555-556 ) however interpreted by Sabara, Medhātithi, the Dayabhāga and others in subsequent times, as meaning that the acquirer ( son or wife ) had no independent power of disposal though he or she was owner of what was earned by him or her. It is noticeable that so lato a writer as Haradatta 1088 relies on this verse of Manu and remarks that while the father is alive whatever is earned by a member, whether learned or not, belongs to the father (on Gaut. 28. 29). The Dāyabhāga 1089 (II. 66-72 ) quotes a text of Kāt. (851) "the father gets two shares or half of the wealth acquired by the son" and explains it in two ways. If the son acquires wealth with the help of ancestral funds, the father takes half of it, the acquirer gets two shares and the other sons one share each; if the son acquires wealth without using ancestral funds, the father and acquirer take two shares each and the others take nothing. Another meaning is that if the father is learned he takes half, but if he is not so, he takes only two shares. The V. P. (pp. 444-45 ) severely criticizes the Dāyabhāga for these remarks. The first inroad on the conception that the earnings of all in the family belonged to the head of the family was made in the times of the sütras by the recognition of vidyadhana as separate property. Manu 10% IX. 208 ( - Vişnu Dh. S. 18. 42 ) states that what one (member of a joint family, a brother etc.) may acquire by his own labour without using ( or without detriment to ) paternal estate he shall

not share with others if he does not desire to do so, because that acquisition was made by his own activity. Manu IX, 206 mentions besides vidyādhana, gifts from friends, gifts at the time of marriage and at madhuparka as the separate property of a person. Yāj. (II. 118–119) prescribes : 'whatever is acquired by a person himself without detriment to or expenditure of paternal wealth, gifts from friends, gifts at marriage, these are not liable to be divided among a man's coparceners; similarly he who recovers ancestral property lost to the family (and not recovered by the father and others) would not have to share it at & partition with his coparceners nor his gains of learning. The construction to be put on these words was a bone of contention even before Visvarūpa. The Mit. understands that the words whatever is acquired without detriment to the paternal wealth' are to be understood as qualifying each of the following four kinds of property.1091 The result is that if a gift is acquired by a member from a grateful person who was placed under obligation by spending family wealth, if property was acquired by gift from a father-in-law who was paid from the family property some wealth for securing the bride for that member ( as in an āsura marriage ) or if the property lost to the family was recovered with the help of paternal estate or if a man learnt at the expense of the family and made gains from that learning, then these kinds of properties were liable to be partitioned ainong all members. The result of taking the first half of Yāj. II. 118 as a qualification of the subsequent four kinds of property ( as done by the Mit. ) is that if a man receives a gift from a stranger even without detriment to the paternal estate the gift was liable to be divided among all members. The reason of the Mit, is that, if the first half of Yaj. II. 118 is not a qualifying clause of the four kinds of property, then the following four kinds need not be expressly mentioned at all. If whatever is acquired by a member himself without

detriment to paternal or joint estate is by itself separate property then the following four will only be particular illustrations of the proposition contained in the first half of Yaj. II. 118. It would be opposed to the usage of diatas to say that gifts from friends or gifts at the time of marriage or gains of learning acquired at the expense of the family estate become the separate property of a person and, as to vidyādhana acquired from learn ing at the expense of the family, opposed to the express text of Nar. ( dāyabhāga 10)“ when one brother maintains the family of another brother who is engaged in studying the sāstras, he shall receive a share of the wealth gained by that study, though he (the supporting brother) be ignorant himself". Further, if the first half of Yāj. II. 118 were taken as a separate and independent clause by itself then it would follow that what is acquired by pratigraha ( as a gift to a learned brāhmana) without detriment to the paternal estate would be indivisible but the usage of the siztas is the opposite of this. That there was such a usage about pratigraha is admitted by the Dāyabhāga (VI. 1, 54 p. 121). It must be stated however that this view of the Mit, about the first half of Yāj. II. 118 is not shared by several writers and works such as the Dāyabhāga VI. 1. 8. p. 106, Dipakalika, Višvarūpa, V. R. p. 501, Apararka p. 723. 

As regards family property lost to the family by the adverse acts of a stranger but recovered by a member with his own efforts without using ancestral estate, certain provisions deserve notice. Manu IX. 209 ( = Vişnu Dh, S. 18. 43), Br. (S, B. E. 33 p. 371 verse 12) and Kāt. 1092 (866) lay down the special rule that if the father recovers property lost to the family, whether movable or immovable, with his own effort without using joint family funds, he may retain the whole of it as his self-acquisition. The rule of Yāj. II. 119 applies only where the property lost and recovered by one member ( not the father) with his own effort and without assistance from joint estate is movable ( which then becomes wholly his self-acquisi tion), but if the property so recovered by one member ( who is

Vidyadhana (gains of learning) bas undergone the greatest changes of fortune since the earliest times to modern days. It was probably the first kind of self-acquisition recognised in very early times. Though the Ap. Dh. S. and Baud. Dh. S. say nothing about it, yet Gaut. 1094a ( 28. 28–29 ) lays down that all members of a joint family ), if not learned, should divide equally whatever is earned by them (by agriculture etc.) but what a learned man himself acquires by his learning he may not share with his unlearned brothers if he so desires. Hara datta says that this applies only between brothers that are joint. Vasiştha 17, 51 appears 1095 to give two shares to the acquirer of wealth at a partition among brothers and bis rule probably represents a very early stage when the acquirer could not retain the whole of his self-acquisition but got only two shares

in it and the rest of the joint family members took one share each in it. Manu IX. 206, Yāj. II. 119, Nār. ( dāyabhāga 11), Kāt. 1096 ( 868 ) and Vyāsa say generally that vidyādhana is not liable to be divided at a partition. Among writers of smộtis Kāt. contains the most elaborate treatment of vidyādhana and of self acquisitions in general. It will be set out in the sequel. But some of the smrtis point out that even vidyādbana is partible, if learning was acquired at the expense of the family funds (as in Nār. dāyabhāga 10 referred to above) or when the learning was acquired in the family house itself from the father or an elder brother (Kat. 1097 874). The Dayabhāga (VI. 1 42-49 ) dis cusses at great length the views of Srikara on Yaj. II. 118 and Manu IX. 208 and dissents from them and states his conclusion as follows: A man since his birth depends upon his family for food and maintenance and go if the words "without expen ding ancestral estate" were literally and widely interpreted, hardly any man can say that no paternal wealth was expended on him and so earnings of whatever kind would have to be deemed to be partible and there would be no propriety or purpose in the words of Manu IX, 208. Therefore it must be under stood as done by Višvarūpa that the detriment mhant is not the expenditure of food in maintaining a person in the house from infancy, but that when a member acquires estate by his learn ing or in any other way without giving or spending paternal wealth for acquiring that, then only it becomes his self acquisition 1098,

Definition of Vidyadhana 

583 

Kat. ( 867-873) defines 1099 and illustrates vidyadhana as follows : 

That wealth is said to be the gains of vidyā which is acquired by means of learning received from another while subsisting on food furnished by others, when a matter ( a doubt or difficult point) has been placed (before an assembly of learned men) with a wager, whatever is gained by (the display of) one's learning is known as vidyādhana, which is not divided at a partition. What is acquired from a pupil (i.e. by following the profession of teaching), by performing the work of a priest at a sacrifice, by propounding a question, by solving a doubtful point, by exhibiting one's knowledge, by disputation with a. rival, what is gained by deep learning-all these are declared to be vidyadhana, which is not divided at a partition. The same is the rule in the case of artisans and as to whatever is obtained (as a reward ) over and above the proper price of an article (which surplus becomes the self-acquisition of the member selling it). After vanquisbing a rival in a wager whatever is obtained by ( superior) knowledge should be known as vidya dhana and it is not liable to be partitioned. This is the view of Brhaspati. What is earned by an assertion of one's learn ing, what is obtained from a pupil (i.e. by teaching) and what is acquired on the analogy of priests officiating at a sacrifice all these are known as vidyadhana, according to Bhrgu. What is obtained by the superiority of one's learning and from a sacrificer and from a pupil-all this is declared to be vidyā. dhana; acquisitions other than these are common (i.e. jointly owned) with others, 

Kāt. distinguishes between suuryadhana (reward given by the king or a master when pleased with a soldier or gervant

who putting his life in danger did an act of valour) and dhvajāhrta ( what is recovered in a battle after putting one's life in danger of death and after putting to flight the army of the adversary). Nār. (dāyabhāga 6 ) and Br. (S. B. E. vol. 33 p. 381 verse 78 ) appear to put both under sauryadhana. Kāt. divides the bhāryādhana of Nār. and Br. into two, viz. lainajāgala ( what is obtained at the time of marriage with a maiden of the same caste ) and raivāhika ( wealth that comes with one's wife ). So it is the same as the vaivāhika ( of Manu IX, 206 ) and the audvāhika (of Yāj. II. 118). Vyāsa mentions 1100 a limitation that even wealth acquired by valour does not be come the exclusive property of the acquirer if he used a horse and wespons belonging to the joint family; in such a case the acquirer gets two shares and the other members of the family one share each. 

In modern times vidyadhana has been a fruitful source of litigation. The first verse of Kāt. quoted above has been cited in several cases such as Durga Dat v. Ganesh Dut 32. All 305 at p. 312, where it is said that Katyayana's definition of vidyā dbana is not exhaustive, but only illustrative (the same is the 

view of the Dāyabhāga ). 

The leading cases that discuss the texts and lay down propositions are noted below 1101 

Two propositions were well established by the cases, viz. (1) that money earned by a member of a joint Hindu family by the practice of a profession requiring special training was joint family property, provided such training was imparted at the expense of joint family property; (2) that gains made by per sonal labour and without the use or help of joint family funds by a member of a joint Hindu family, who was maintained out of joint family funds and received no more than an elementary or ordinary education suitable to his position as a member of that particular family were the self-acquisitions of such member. But all doubts and disputes are now set at rest by the Hindu

Gains of Learning Act 

585 

Gains of Learning Act (Act XXX of 1930 ) which provides that, notwithstanding any custom, rule or interpretation of Hindu Law, no gains of learning (i. e. education whether ele mentary, technical, scientific, special or general and training of every kind which enables. a person to pursue any trade, in dustry or avocation), whether made before or after the com mencement of the Act, shall be held not to be the exclusive and separate property of the acquirer merely by reason of his learning having been wholly or in part imparted to him by any member, living or deceased, of his family or with the aid of the funds of the joint family or of any member thereof or by reason of himself or his family having, while he was acquiring his learn ing, been supported wholly or in part by the joint funds of the family or the funds of any member thereof. This Act is thus retrospective. 

All property of a joint family other than the separate property of individual members is liable to partition, i. e. as stated by Kāt., property of the grandfather, of the father and whatever is acquired by each member (by the use of joint funds 1102 is so liable). Separate property is said to be impartible (avibhājya) on account of the source from which or the manner in which it is acquired. But there are certam kinds of property. which from their very nature are not allowed to be partitioned and have to be enjoyed in common or by turns. 

The oldest provision on this point is contained in Gautama1103 ( 28. 44-45 ) that water (well), (property set apart or destined for) pious uses or sacrifices and food prepared (for festivals etc.) shall not be divided nor women connected with individual

Similarly Usanas says 1105 " there is no partition among agnates epen up to the thousandth generation of what is acquired by officiating as priests, of a field, of vehicles, prepared food, water and women". Prajapati (quoted by Sm. C. II p. 277) asserts that there is no partition of houses, fields and temples (yājya), gifts made through favour by the father or mother. The prohi bition against dividing a house or a field is explained in three ways. The Mit. on Yaj. II. 119 explains that it has in view a brāhmaṇa's son from a wife of the kşatriya or vaisya class, when the brahmapa acquired it as a religious gift made to him for his learning, since Br. (S. B. E. 33 p. 374 verse 30 ) states "land bestowed 1106 as a gift on a brāhmana should not be given to the son of the brāhmaṇa ) from a wife of the ksatriya caste; even if the father gives it to the son of the ksatriya wife, after the father's death, the son of the wife of the brahmana class

may take it away". Another explanation is that the prohibition refers to a site or dwelling for religious purposes and to a field that is meant for grazing cowo. The third explanation is that the prohibition implies that when the house or field is of small value it should not be partitioned by metes and bounds, but there should be partitioning of the price only. The Dayabbāga gives yet another explanation ( VI. 2. 30 p. 128) that if during the father's lifetime any of the sons builds a house or lays out a garden on a family site, then it should not be divided at a partition but assigned to him only. 

ual in value and impartible, probos ordinarily 

The basic verse on things impartible from their very nature is Manu IX. 219 1107 ( =Vişnu Dh. S. 18. 44 ) which gays "clothes, vehicles, ornaments, cooked food, water (well etc.), women, yogakşema and ways--these are declared to be impartible". All commentators explain that clothes ordinarily worn by the several members are impartible, provided they are more or less equal in value but not costly ones nor new ones. The same remark applies to vehicles and ornaments. Pracāra means either" ways leading to the house, garden and the like" (Mit., Aparārka, and V. P.) and also 'ways and pasture lands for cows and the like' (Sm. C. II. p. 277, Kullūka). The Mit. (on Yāj. II. 118-119 ) states a special rule from Bộ. that 1108 the clothes and ornaments worn by the father, the bed and the vehicle used by him should on his death be donated to the brāhmaṇa invited at the father's śrāddha, As to ornaments, the Mit, following Manu IX. 200 says that those ornaments that are ordinarily worn by the respective members or their wives should not be divided, but those that are not so used everyday should be divided.

be partitioned by valuing it. 109 If there be a single female slave (not a concubine ) she was to be made to work for the divided members by turns, but if there be several slaves they could be assigned to each or their price could be divided. The expression "yogakşema" has been variously explained from very ancient times. Laugākşi ( quoted by the Mit.) states "those who know the truth Bay that 'yoga' means 'sacrifices and kşema means pūrta (i. e. works of charity like wells). They both (i. e. the money set apart for these or the merit derived from these ) are impartible, as are also the bed and the ( wooden) Beat (used by the father or other member )." From this verse the Mit. concludes that yogak şema means sacrificial acts performed with srauta or smārta fire and charitable gifts such as construct ing a tank or park etc. For ista and pārta vide H. of Dh, vol. II. pp. 147,843-844 and pp. 914-915 n.2112 for the Mit. on yogaksema. The words“ yoga" and " kşema" occur even in the Rgveda VII. 86. 8, X. 89, 10, X. 166.5 and in Tai Br. III. 9. 19.3 and Ait. Br. 37. 2. Even though joint family funds are spent for these still they are impartible. The Mit. further states that according to some yogakşema means 1110 "royal ministers and purohita" who bring about the welfare of people, while others hold that the word means " umbrella, chourie, weapons, shoes, and the like". From Gaut. IX. 63 and XI. 16 it appears that yogaksema came to mean even before Gautama's time "comfortable life" or "easy and happy way of maintenance" (particularly for a learned brāhmaṇa). The V.

aooording to Prakāśa, yogakşema means "maintenance or annuity descending from the father (to the son) at a royal palace" and that Halayudha explained yoga as meaning a ship or the like and kşeina as fort. The Sm. O. II. p. 277 after quot ing Laugākşi gives an alternative explanation that yogakşema means the wealth gained by a learned brāhmaṇa resorting to a rich man for his maintenance, 1112 

Kaut. ( III. 5 ) states 1113 the view of the acāryas that those who are poor may divide even their water vessels and Kaut. adds that this dictum is fallacious or contradictory. Kat. (882-884) brings together several things that are impartible 1114 " money that is entered in a document and is set apart for a religious purpose, water, women, a nibandha ( periodic gain) that descends hereditarily, clothes worn (on the body every day), ornaments, whatever else that is not fit to be divided-these should be so employed by co-sharers that they may be enjoyed (in common by all) at the proper time. A pasture for cattle, ways, clothes worn on the body (every day), money lent and what is set apart for religious purposes--these should not be divided. This is the view of Bphaspati." 

Bphaspati ( S. B. E. 33 p. 382 verses 79-84 ) has a good deal to say about things impartible. He finds fault with Manu IX. 219 for his somewhat wide proposition that clothes, ornaments

and the Mke are impartible. He says 1115 " those who declared that clothes and the like are impartible have not given proper thought. In the case of the rich, their wealth may consist of (valuable ) clothes and ornaments. If these ( clothes and orna ments ) be kept joint ( i. e. undivided ) they cannot yield subsis tence nor can they be assigned to one alone (out of many co-sharers ). They should therefore be distributed with skill, otherwise they will become useless. Clothes and ornaments may be divided by selling them (i. e. by dividing the proceeds of sale ), debt consigned to writing is divided after recovering it (i. e. the bond itself is not divided ), cooked food ( may be divid ed) by exchanging it for uncooked food. The waters of wells that have flights of steps and of other wells is to be enjoyed by drawing it out according to the needs of the co-sharers ); in the same way a field or a water course is to be enjoyed according to respective shares ; a single female slave is to be made to work in the houses of the co-sharors according to their shares; if there be several female slaves, they are to be allotted in equal shares ( to the sharers ); this very rule applies to male slaves also; the income derived from a yogaksema grant is to be equally divid ed and pasture lands (or ways) are to be used by the co-sharers according to their respective shares. " 

The next points to be dealt with are: what persons are entiti ed to partition and what is the mode of partition. But before doing 80 some preliminary remarks must be made on the express ions coparconary and joint family', which occur at every step in modern works on Hindu Law. In the smrtis and commentaries we come across the words kutumba (Nār., dattāpradānika 6 or Yaj. II. 175), or vibhakta-kutumba (Yāj. II. 45). A joint Hindu family consists of all males lineally descended from a common male ancestor and includes their wives and unmarried daughters. A daughter on marriage ceases to be a member of her father's

family and beconies a member of her husband's family. Under the Mitakşarā a Hindu coparcenary strictly so called is a much narrower group than the joint family. It comprises only those males who take by birth an interest in the joint or coparcenary property i, e, a person himself and his sons, son's song and son's grandsons form for the time being a coparcenary. The diagram and the note below 1116 will explain the limits of a coparcenary. 

A coparcenary is purely a creation of law; it cannot be created by act of parties, except by adoption. In order to be able to claim a partition, it does not matter how remote from the common ancestor a person may be, provided he is not more than four degrees removed from the last male owner who has himself taken an interest by birth. 1117 

Some characteristic features of the Mitāksarā coparcenary may be briefly stated. There is in the first place unity of ownership i. e. the whole body of coparceners is the owner and no individual member can say, wbile the family is undivided, that he has a definite share, as his interest is always fluctuating, being liable to be onlarged by deaths and diminished by births in the family. There is also unity of possession and enjoyment i. e. all are entitled to possession and enjoyment of the family 

1116. Vide Commissioner of Income Taxv. Laxminarayan 59. Bom, 618 at p. 621. 

Here all are to be assumed to be males. A and his sons B and C may form a coparcenary. So also, if B and C have each a son, then A, B, C, D, E, will form a coparcenary. If D and E have respectively F and Gas sons, all persons from A to G will form a coparcenary. But bere the limit is reached. If X is born during the lifetime of A, he being the son of the great-grand 

son of A takes no interest by birth and is outside the coparcenary during A's lifetime. But if X is born after the death of A, then he forms a coparcenary with B, D, F. Suppose that B dies before A. That will not however introduce X iato the coparcenary of which A is the head, as X being the son of A's great-grandson F takes no interest by birth in ancestral property held by Ą. Suppose that BCDEF and G all die in the lifetime of A, then A becomes the sole surviving coparcener and X is not & coparcener along with A, because he is 3th ia descent (counting both A and X) from A, Suppose A the only surviving coparcener dies. Then X will take A's property as an heir and not by survivorship as a coparcener.

property and the possession of one is ordinarily possession on behalf of all. Further, while the family is joint and some coparceners have many children and others have few or pone or some are absent, they cannot complain at the time of partition about some coparceners having exhausted the whole income and cannot ask for an account of past income and expenditure. Kāt. ( 883 ) expressly states so. 1118 Moreover, the joint family property devolves by survivorship i. e. on the death of a coparcener his interest lapses and goes to the other coparceners, subject to this that if the deceased has left a son, grandson, or great-grandson, the latter represents and occupies the place of the deceased coparcener when a partition takes place. A female cannot be a coparcener (even if she be the wife or the mother ). Another characteristic is that each coparcener has a right to enforce a partition. The affairs of the family are managed by the father and if he be very old or dead, by the senior brother or member or by any other member with the consent of the senior member(Nār., dāyabhāga 5 and Sankha quoted above in note 1067). The manager is called kartā in modern times though the smrtis and digests employ words like kutumbin (Yāj. 11. 45), grhin, grhapati, prabhu (Kāt. 543 ) and not kartā. He has special powers of disposition ( by mortgage, sale or gift) of family property in a season of distress (for debts), for the purposes and benefit of the family (maintenance, education and marriages of members and other dependents ) and particularly for religious purposes ( $rāddhas and the like ), 1119 The father has the same powers as manager and certain other special powers, which no other coparcener has. The father can separate his sons from himself and also among themselves if he so desires, even if they do not desire to separata 1120 ( Yāj. II. 114); while an ordinary

Powers of father in joint family

coparcener can only separate himself from the family. The father can make within reasonable limits gifts of ancestral movable property without 1121 the consent of his sons for performing indispensable acts of duty and for purposes laid down by the texts, such as gifts through affection (to wife, daughter, son or the like), the support of the family and relief from distress. The father can make a gift of even immovable property within 1122 reasonable limits for pious purposes only (such as to a family ido) or to an idol in a temple at the time of obsequies ). The father can sell or mortgage the joint family property to pay off an antecedent debt contracted by him for his own personal benefit, provided it is not illegal or immoral ( vide p. 448 above ). No coparcener ( except the father or manager as stated above) can dispose of his undivided interest by gift, sale or mortgage according to the strict theory of the Mitākşarā except with the consent of the other coparceners. This right to object to alienations made without consent or made without legal necessity is another characteristio of the joint Hindu family under the Mitākşarā. Br. ( S. B. E. 33 p. 384 verse 93) says 1123 "whether kinsmen are joint or separate they are alike as regards immovable property, since a single one from among them has no power in any case to make a gift, sale or mortgage of it." But in modern times the courts in Bombay, Madras and the Central Provinces have loosened this strict rule by holding that

History of Dharmaśāstra 

(Vol. 

a coparcener may sell, mortgage or alienate for value his undivided interest in coparcenary property without the consent of the other coparceners 114 and the courts have allowed the undivided interest of a coparcener in joint family property to he attached at the instance of a creditor for the individual debts of a coparcener. This is one of the most serious departures from ancient and medieval Hindu Law made by the Courts on the ground of equity. One more right of all members of the joint Hindu family is the right to be maintained from the property and income of the joint family. Such matters as the remedies of the purchaser or mortgagee from an individual coparcener are here left out of consideration as appropriate only in a treatise on modern Hindu Law. 

The conception of a coparcenary under the Dāyabhāga system is entirely different from that of the Mitaksara. Under the Dāyabhāga, bons do not acquire any interest hy birth in ancestral property, but the son's rights arise for the first time on the father's death and the sons take as heirs and not by survivorship. There is hence no coparcenary in the sense of the Mitākşarā between a father and his sons. The father has absolute power to dispose of all kinds of ancestral property by sale, mortgage, gift, will or otherwise in the same way as he can dispose of his separate property. The son has no right to demand a partition during his father's lifetime. A coparcenary starts on the death of the father between the latter's sons or grandsons i. e. between brothers, uncles and nephews, or between cousins. If a coparcener dies without male issue, there is no right of survivorship in the other coparceners but the deceased member's widow or daughter may succeed to his share and thus even females may become members of a coparcenary under the Daya bhaga. Each coparcener takes a defined share under the Dāya bhāga ( not an indefinite one as under the Mitākşarā ).. Any ooparconer under the Dayabhāga can sell, mortgage, or dispose off by gift or will his share ( Dāyabhāga II. 28-31 ). 1125

Rights of posthumous son 

595 Every coparcener is entitled to a share on partition. It has been already stated (on pp. 570-571 ) how in Bombay a son is not entitled to a partition if the father is joint with his own father, brothers or other coparceners and does not assent to the son's claim. There is a volume of case-law about a suit for partition brought on behalf of a minor, but it has to be passed over here, as there is hardly anything corresponding to this in the works on dharma śāstra. The texts provide for the case of a son who was in the mother's womb at the time of partition but was born after it. If A. and his sons B and C, who are members of a joint family, come to a partition and take one third each of the family property and six months later A's wife gives birth to a son D. then the partition has to be reopened and D will get 1 ( } if the mother is given a share ) of the family property that will remain after meeting all proper charges since the first partition and taking into account all income and accretions during the interval. The same rule applies to a partition among brothers, when the widow of a predeceased brother gives birth to a posthumous son conceived before the partition but born after it, Vide Yāj. 1126 II. 12% and Visou Dh. 8. 17, 3. Vasiştha ( 17. 40-41) therefore recommends that when it is known that the wives of some brothers (predeceased) are pregnant the other brothers should postpone partition till the delivery of those women, Where a son is born as well as conceived after partition between a father and his sonis the rights of the afterborn son are declar. ed by Gaut. 1127 28. 27, Manu IX, 216, Yāj.

acquisitions of the father made after the partition. 1129 The Mit. understands that the first half (of Yaj. II. 122 ) refers to a parti tion during the father's lifetime and provides that if a son was conceived and born to the father after partition he took the share allotted to the father and all the self-acquisitions of the father made after partition (tathā vibhāgottarakālam pitrā yat kincit arjitam tat sarvam vibhaktajasyaiva) and the Mit. relies on Manu IX. 216 and Bř. for this. The Mit takes the 2nd half of Yāj. II. 122 as referr ing to a partition made after the father's death and states that, if a son was in the mother's womb when the brothers separated after the father's death and was born subsequently, the posthum ous son would be entitled to reopen the partition and would get a share out of the property (not as it stood at the date of partition) that would be there after allowing for proper expendi ture (e. g. payment of debts etc.) and accretions. The Mit. extends the same rule to a posthumous son born after partition to the widow of a brother who died before the partition and 

1129. In Nawal Singh v. Bhagwan Singh 4 All. 427, where alter the father separated from his three sons he married a second wife, had a son from her and died leaving certain property inherited by bim from a third person, it was held, relying on Mapu, the Mit., Br, and the Viramitrodaya, that the son born after partition was entitled to the whole of the property acquired by the father to the exclusion of the three sons that had separated from him. In Chengama v. Munisami 20 Mad.75 (where a father partitioned his ancestral property half and half between bis two sons, reserved no share for himself and subsequently another son was born to him) it was held that the subsequently boro son was entitled to one-third by partition not only in the property as it stood at the date of partition, but also in the property acquired by the two sons by means of the produce of that property (relying on the words of Yaj. II. 122 "āyavyayavisodhitat"). The dates of the partition and of the birth of the son are not clear from the report. In Ganpat v. Gopalrao 23 Bom. 636 (where in 1875 & father separated his 800 born of his first wife by giving bim one third of the estate and gave two thirds to his two minor sons from the second wife and lived with them and another son was born to him in 1880, who sued in 1894 claiming one-fourth of all property) it was held that the one third given to the son by the first wife could not be affected and the plaintiff was only entitled to claim a share in the property given to the other two sons, and furtber that the texts of Vişnu and Yājñavalkya are somewbat vague and are applicable only to the case of posthumous sons who have no provision made for them.

when the fact of the pregnancy was not known to the separating brothers. Visvarüpa regards the whole verse as laying down one proposition, the first half declaring that if a son ( who had been already conceived ) were born to the father after partition with the sons, he would be entitled to the share taken by the father, while the 2nd half declares that if the father took no share then the son so born would be entitled to reopen the partit ion and take a share of the property remaining after taking into account accretions and expenses. The Dipakalikā seems to be of the same opinion as Visvarüpa, but it adds that Manu IX. 216 provides for the case where the son is both conceived and born after partition. The Sm. C. (II. pp. 306-307 ) holds that when in the father's lifetime partition takes place the sons separating should give a share to the after-born son, but the father should retain his, while the whole of Yāj. II. 122 applies to the case where partition is made after the father's death and a posthum ous son is born to the mother or to the widow of a brother dying before partition. In such a case the partition should be reopened and a share given out of the property as it stood at the first partition or out of the property as found to exist at the reopened partition after allowing for accretions and proper expenses (for payment of debts, for samskāras of brothers and sisters ); vide V. P. p. 463 for explanation of 'drøyad' etc. The Vyavahāra-mayükha (p. 105 ) follows the Sm. C. and V. R. (p. 539 ) in explaining the whole of Yaj II. 122 as refer ring to the case of a posthumous son conceived before partition made on the father's death but born after partition from the mother or step-mother of the separating brothers or from the wife of a brother dying before partition. 

An adopted son, if adopted by a coparcener in a joint family or by a sole surviving coparcener, becomes under the Mitakşarā law a member of the coparcenary from the moment of his adoption and has the same rights to demand a partition as an aurasa son has. Under the Dāyabhāga even an aurasa son cannot claim partition during his father's life and so an adopted son would be in no better position. If after a person adopts he has an aurasa son, the adopted son's share becomes reduced according to most commentators, but this subject will be dealt with later on under adoption. 

The emptis and some of the medieval and later digests even enter into elaborate discussions about the rights of a son or sons born from wives of classes lower than that of the father. Vide

Gaut. 28. 33-37, Baud. Dh. S. II. 2. 10, Kauţ. III. 6, Vas. 17. 48-50, Manu IX. 149-155, Yaj. II. 125, Vişņu Dh. S. 18. 1-33, Nār. ( dāyabhāga 14 ), Bṛ. ( S. B. E. 33 p. 374 verses 27-29 ), Sankha ( quoted in V. R. p. 531 ). It is not necessary to deal in detail with the varying provisions made in these works, as marriages with women of a lower class have not been in vogue for several conturies; but a few remarks will have to be made. Manu IX. 153 and Yāj. II. 125, Bř. (S. B. E. 33 p. 374 v. 27 ) clearly state that if a brāhmaṇa has song from wives of the four classes, the whole property should be divided into ten parts which should be distributed as follows four for the son of the wife of the brābmaça caste, three for the son of the ksatriya caste wife, two for the son of the vaisya caste wife and one for the son of the sūdra class wife. Manu IX. 154 ( almost the same as Anušāsana 47,21 ) further provides that whether a brāhmana leaves sons or no sons born (of wives of the three twice-born classes ) the heir shall give, according to the law, to the son of a südra class wife no more than a tenth part of his estate. V. P. p. 487 and the Mit. (on Yāj. II. 133) after quoting Manu, make this quite clear. But as remarked by the Mit. on Yāj. II. 125 the son of a brāhmaṇa from a wife of the ksatriya or other lower class was not to share in land obtained by the brāhmaṇa by way of gift (vide Br. quoted in note 1106 above ) though he could share land acquired by purchase or the like. A verse ( attributed to Bṛ, by Day. IX. 22 and V. R. p. 534 and to Devala by V. P. p. 466) denies altogether a share in land to a sūdra class wife's son of a brāhmaṇa, while Manu IX. 155 (the son of a person of the three higher classes from a südra woman gets no share in the paternal wealth) is Variously explained, the Mit. saying that it applies only where the son has already got some property from his father while the Mayukha and some others say that it applies to the son of a südra woman who is not married to the person of higher caste but is only a mistress. Kauţ. III. 6 and Br. (quoted by V. R. P. 534) provide that the pārašava son gets of his father's estate and the nearest sapinda gets the remaining two thirds. Sankha-Likhita ( quoted by Medhātithi on Manu. IX. 155 ) have the same rule as in Manu IX. 155. It is remarkable that early medieval writers like Vijñāneśvara (about 1100 A. D.) or even later ones like Mitramiāra ( first half of 17th century) in V, P. pp 464-466 enter with zest into elaborate explanations of Manu IX. 153 and Yāj. II. 125 and never expressly state that these Verses had ceased to be applicable in their days, though there

are a few other medieval works like the Sm. C. II. pp. 288-289 and the Madanaratna 1130 that either do not explain these Verses at all or say that these verses are applicable to a different age. According to Manu (IX. 178, 160) the son of a brāhmana from a sūdra class wife is called saudra or pāraśava, while according to Yaj. I. 91 he is called both nişada and pārašava (vide H. of Dh. vol. II. pp. 86-87 for nisada and parasava). But he is one of the secondary sons (gauna-putra) according to Manu (Ix. 180), Vas. 17.38 and others. Writers from Apararka downwards quote certain 1131 verses from Saunaka on matters forbidden in the Kali age (kali-carjya) one of which is the acceptance of sons other than auraga and dattaka. 1132

1132. In Natha v. Chotalal 55 Bom. 1 the son of a brāhmana from a sūdra wife was held entitled to a tenth sbare in the estate of his father and uncle and that the remaining nine-tentbs would go to the nearest agnate, and Manu and Yāj. are relied upon. But this would be opposed to the view of the Mayūkha that secondary sons are not allowed now and is also against the spirit of the warning given by the Privy Council to Judges of modern times over 75 years ago in Collector of Madura v. Mootoo Ramlinga 12 Moo. I. A. 397 at p. 436 " the duty of an European Judge who is under an obligation to administer Hindu Law is not so much to inquire whether a disputed doctrine is fairly deducible from the earliest authorities, as to ascer tain whether it has been received by the particular school which governs the district with which he has to deal and has there been sanctioned by usage. For under the Hindu system of law, clear proof of usage will out weigh the written text of the law. This passage (omitting the word "European") is quoted by the P. C. in Atmaram . Bajirao 62 I. A. 139 where it is further held that in a conflict between smrti texts and commen tators the opinion of the latter prevails in the provinces where their autho. rity is recognized. Natha v.

An illegitimate son has in certain circumstances rights of partition in the property of bis putative father. An illegitimate son may be a son by a concubine who is a lāsi (i. e. who is in exclusive and continuous keeping) or he may be the son of a woman who is not a clasi. The first is called dāsiputra"33 and the second is hardly ever dealt with in dharmaśāstra works. 1134

Gujerat where the Vyavahāramayukha is of paramount authority. In both cases not a word is said about the proof of the usage of marriages between a brāhmana and a sudra woman taking place in Gujerat but reliance is placed solely on the recognition of anuloma marriages by Maou and Yājõavalkya, the strong condemnation of pratiloma marriages by both and the inference drawn from the comment of Vijānesvara and the remarks of Nilakantha that anuloma marriages are not prohibited. With the most profound respect for the learned Judges who decided those two cases, it has to be said that they took up the position of legislators and did not merely interpret the Hindu Law in accordance with usage aod ignored the text of the Mayūkha itself statiog that all secondary sons (among which the son of a brāhmana from a gudra caste wife is included by Manu) except aurasa son (who is defined by Yāj. II, 128 hinself and the Mit, as the son of a wife of the same class) and dattaka are forbidden in the present age. The decision in Bai Gulab v. Jivanlal was opposed to the considered view expressed by Chandavarkar J. in Bai Kashi v. Jamnadas, 14 Bom. L. R. 547 at p. 552 ". From this gloss of the Mitāksarā from which Nilakantha expressed no where any dissent it is reasonable to infer tbat, according to the leading authorities on Hindu Law as recognised in this Presidency, a shudra wife is not permitted to a brahmin, a kshatriya or a vaishya"and to the decisions of some other High Courts in India (vide 28 All. 458 for example). It should not be supposed that the present writer is entirely against such marriages. What he is concerned to emphasize is that the Legislature should deal with these matters, that Judges should not assume the role of legislators and give rise to conflict of laws which are inevitable if the same kind of marriage is held valid by the Bombay High Court and invalid by the Allahabad or Madras High Court.

Rights of illegitimate sons 

601 

From ancient times it had been settled that the dāsiputra of a person belonging to the twice-born classes is not entitled to a share on partition or to inherit, but is entitled to maintenance only. Gāut. 28. 37 provides 1135 that even the son of a brāhmaṇa who is issueless from .a śüdra woman (a concubine ) should receive the means of maintenance provided he is obedient in the manner of a pupil. Bộ. (8. B. E. vol. 33 p. 374 verse 31 ) contains a similar rule for the maintenance of an illegitimate son born of a südra woman after the father's death. But as regards the son of a sūdra from a dāsi Manu IX. 179 provides that such an illegitimate son may take a share in the father's property if the father allows him to do so. The classical passage on the rights of the illegitimate son of a śüdra from a dāsi is Yāj. II. 133-134 which verses are introduced by the V. Mayūkha 1136 with the words "Yāj. declares a special rule as regards one begotten by a sūdra on a woman ( of the same caste ) not married to him" and which may be rendered thus "even a son begotten by a śūdra on a dāsi may partake of a share at the choice (of his father ). But, when the father is. dead, the brothers should make him the recipient of a half share". This passage and the comments of the Mit., the V. Mayūkha, the Dāyabhāga have been cited and explained in numerous cases. The following propositions as deduced from the texts and the case-law may be set out here :-(1) the illegi timate son of a sūdra even under the Mit. does not acquire by birth any interest in the estate held by the father and so cannot enforce a partition in his father's lifetime, but the father may give him a share in his lifetime, which may even be equal to that of a legitimate gon ( 4 Bom. 37, 44-45, 23 Mad. 16 ); (2) on the father's death an illegitimate son of a deceased sūdra

1137. The decisions establish that dasi is not to be taken in the strict literal sense (a female slave), but means a woman kept as a concubine, the connection being continuous, exclusive and lawful. In order that the illegi timate son of a südra may take a sbare or inherit, it must be shown that the connection between the sūdra man and the woman was not incestuous or adulterons or though adulterous at the beginning had ceased to be so when the illegitimate son was born. Vide Rahi v. Govind i Bom. 97 at p. 110, Sadu v. Baixa 4 Bom. 37 (F. B.) at p. 44, Vithabai v. Pandit 28 Bom. L. R. 595, Soundararajan v. Arunachalam 39 Mad, 136 (F. B.) pp. 152-159, Tukaram v. Dinkar 33 Bom, L. R. 289. But even the son of an adulterous intercourse has been beld entitled to maintenance (1 Mad. 306, 34 Mad, 68, 47 Bom. L. R.5 F, B.). The earlier cases in Calcutta (as in i Cal. 1, 19 Cal. 91, 28 Cal. 194), held that dasi meant only a female slave and as slavery was abolished in Iodia, there could be no dzsiputra strictly so called. But in Rajaninath v. Nitai 48 Cal. 643 (F. B.) the former Calcutta decisions were overruled and the Bombay High Court's interpretation of dāsiputra has been accepted. The passage of the Daya bhāga (IX. 29 p. 143) which was to be correctly interpreted in the Calcutta Cases runs "grey gareurofiraruram: falhar a rrutia: तदाह महावास्या वा (मनु IX. 179) | अनुमतिमन्तरेण स्पर्धीशहरः सदाह याज्ञवल्क्यः । wortrae (05.

son cannot demand a partition of the joint family property though he is entitled to maintenance as a member of the family provided the father left no separate estate (L. R. 58 I. A. 402 ). It bas been held that if a sūdra keeps a woman of the brahmana caste as his exclusive mistress and has a son from her, he is not a dāsiputra (but aoc. ancient works a cāpdāla), and is not entitled to inherit the estate the südra father as an illegi timate son. Vide Ramchandra v. Hanumnaik 37 Bom. L. R. 920 followed in 18 Lucknow 585. Further rules about the inheri tance of the illegitimate son when in competition with the widow, legitimate daughter or legitimate daughter's son will be dealt with later on (vide n. 1356 below). 

An absent coparcener stood on the same footing as a minor ( vide note 1077 above ); in modern times he would be subject to the law of Limitation (Articles 127 and 144 of the Indian Limitation Act of 1908). 

The wife cannot herself demand a partition, but if the hus band himself separates his sons during his lifetime or if the gons claim a partition during the father's lifetime, the wife was entitled to a share equal to that of a son, according to Yāj. II. 115. If there be several wives each gets a share equal to that of a son. There is a proviso that the wife or wives must not be in possession of stridhana property given by the husband or by the father-in-law and that if there is stridhana, then only as much more will be allotted to her as will make her share equal to that of a son (as stated in Yāj. II. 148). The Mit. on Yāj. II. 52 states that at the husband's will the wife also gets a share of the faniily wealth but not by her own will 1139, The Madana ratna explains that the meaning 1140 is simply this that the

father when separating from the sons should take for each of his wives a share equal to that of each son, but it is not meant that the husband is to carve out separate portions of the joint property and hand them over to his wives, since such a proce dure would be opposed to the dictum "there is no partition between husband and wife". The V. P. (pp. 441-42) after quoting this view of the Madanaratna refutes it by saying that Yaj, is not here speaking of the partition between husband and wife but between the father and sons and that the husband assigns to the wife a share as he may give a gift of affection to his wife. It deserves to be noted that the ancient commentator Visvarūpa ( on Yaj. II. 119 of Tri. edition) anticipates modern legislation as he states that the widows of pre-deceased sons and grandsons also should be given the shares that would have been taken by their husbands if living along with his own wives by the father at the time of partition with his sons. Recently by the Hindu Women's Rights to Property Act (Act XVIII of 1937 as amended by Act XI of 1938), it is provided that when after the Act comes into force a Hindu governed by the Dāyabhāga School dies intestate or where a Hindu governed by any other school dies living separate property, his widow will be entitled to the same share as that of a son and the widow of a pre-deceased son or grandson shall inherit in the same manner as a son or grandson and further where a Hindu governed by any school other than the Dāyabhāga dies having an interest in joint family property his widow will succeed to a Hindu widow's estate as regards the interest he himself had. This last provision brings the law of the Mitākşarā into line with that of the Dāyabhāga and makes the widow of a deceased coparcener a member of the coparcenary and at one stroke does away with the fundamental doctrine of the Mit. about

Rights of mother at a partition

male coparconers alone taking by survivorship joint family property, 1141 

The mother (or step-mother) also, when the sons come to a partition after the father's death, is entitled to a share equal to that of a son in the coparcenary property.1141a But she cannot compel a partition so long as the sons choose to remain joint. But her share is liable to be reduced on account of her possession of stridhana as in the case of the wife. Vide Yāj. II. 123, Vişnu Dh. 8. 18. 34 and Nār. ( dayabhāga, 12). The Mit. (on Yāj. II. 135) combats the view of some predecessors that the mother does not take a share but oply as much wealth as would be necessary for her maintenance, by relying on the words "equal share" occurring in Yāj., Vispu, and Nār. which would be meaningless on that view. It also refutes another view that the mother takes an equal share with the sons when the ances tral property is small, while she takes only as much as would be necessary for her maintenance when the property is large, by stating that this view is liable to the fault of vidhivairūpya according to the conclusion established in the Pūrvam māmsā, that is, here the same sentence will be interpreted as laying down two different propositions in different sets of circum stances, which is not a legitimate or reasonable way of inter pretation. The Sm. C.(IL p 268 ) held the same view about the mother having no right to a share and was criticized by the Madanaratna (by name).

view that no woman (whether wife or mother ) should get a share of the ancestral wealth but only as much wealth as is necessary for maintenance and rely on the words of Baudha yana "there is a Vedio text that women are devoid of strength and take no share", which refers to a passage in the Tai, S. VI. 5.8.2, oocurring in the context of the ritual of the Soma sacri fice "therefore women being destitute of strength take no portion (of Soma drink) and speak more weakly than even a wretched (low ) man". Manu IX. 18 also contains an echo of this passage of the Tai. S. and of Baud, Dh. S. There was an intermediate stage in the evolution of the rights of the wife or mother. The highest she could get in the husband's wealth was two thousand papas, according to Vyasa, 1143 which is variously read and explained, the Sm. C. (II. p. 281 ) saying that it means as much wealth as would every year yield an income of 2000 papas. 

In modern times some High Courts such as those at Bombay 1144 and Calcutta allow wives and mothers to have a share when the husband or the sons divide ancestral estate by metes and bounds, while in Southern India the practice of allotting shares to them has gone out of vogue long since and the Madras High Court does not allow a share to the mother but only maintenance. The Dayabhāga seems to have 1145 held that a step-mother who was herself sonless was not entitled to a share when her step-sons came to a partition, but was only entitled to maintenance (vide Srimuli Hemangini v. Kedarnath L. R. 16 I. A. p. 115 at p. 117).

Patnibhaga division 

607 

" If a person had several wives and several sons from each wife, some of the texts prescribed from very ancient times that the song should divide according to the wives or mothers (i. e. patnibhñga, or which is practically the same thing, mātsbhāya was recommended ), though the generally recognized rule for merly as well as now is to divide according to the number of song i. e. putrabhāga ( ignoring the fact of their being born from 1146 different mothers ). For example, Gaut. 28. 15 recommends that partition should be made by grouping the sons according to their mothers and then allowing a special share to the eldest among each group of sons. Both Br. (8. B. E. 33 p. 372 verse 15) and Vyāsa 1117 lay down that if there be many sons sprung from the same father, who are equal in caste and number but who are the sons of different mothers, a division according to mothers may be legally made. Such a partition on the basis of mothers is recognized in rare cases even now on 1148 the ground of custom in certain places and among certain castes. 

A paternal grandmother or step-grandmother cannot herself demand a partition, but when a partition takes place between her son's sons, her own son being dead or when it takes place between her son and the sons of a deceased son she is entitled to a share. A text of Vyasa says 1149" the childless wives of the father are declared to be entitled to a share equal ( to that of a son) and all grandmothers are declared equal to the mother". The Allahabad and Bombay High Courts hold that the grandmother is not entitled to a share when a partition takes place between her son and his sons, while the High Courts

of Calcutta and Patna hold that she is entitled to a share even in this last cage 1150 

On account of certain bodily, mental or other defects and certain conduct also persons were excluded in ancient India from demanding a share on partition and also from taking by inheritance. Gaut. 28. 41, Ap. Dh. S. II. 6. 14. 1, Vas. 17. 52-53, Vişnu Dh. S. 15 32–39, Baud. Dh. S. II. %. 43-46, Kaut. III. 5 speak 1151 of various grounds of exclusion from partition (and inheritance) such as lunacy, idiocy, impotence, excommunica tion for grave sins or lapses of conduct, blindness, incurable disease, entering a different āśrama (viz. that of forest hermit or sannyāsa ). These grounds of exclusion probably arose from the fact of the persons labouring under them being regarded as incompetent to perform religious acts and from the close connection between property and its use for religious purposes. Jaimini 1152 (VI. 1. 41-42) lays down two propositions, viz. that one who is suffering froin an incurable or irremediable bodily defect is not entitled to undertake vedic rites, such as Agni hotra, but that one who has some defect which is remediable may engage in them and Sabara gives a blind man, a deaf man and a cripple as persons who are incompetent to engage in Vedic rites. The story of the brothers Devāpi and Santanu ( vide

J. 39, 42-44 (for the opposite proposition that tho grandmother would be entitled to a sbare io a partition between her only son and the latter's son). In view of tbe fact that Vyasa declares the grand. mother to be equal to the mother it appears that all grand-mothers, whether sonless or not, should secure a shara.

Grounds of exclusion from partition

H. of Dh. vol. II. p. 109 ) as narrated in the Bșhad-devata 1153 states that the elder brother Devāpi suffered from & skin disease and so refused the kingdom which went to his younger brother Santanu. We know from the Mahabharata that Dhrta rāştra who was blind from birth, though elder, had to give up the kingdom in favour of his younger brother Pāņdu 1154. The Mit. (on Yāj. II, 135 ) energetically combats the view put for ward by some predecessors that all wealth is meant for sacrifices. They relied on two smrti passages 1155 "all dravya (all kinds of wealth or movable property) has been created for the sake of sacrifice; therefore all those who are not competent to perform sacrifices are not entitled to share ancestral wealth but are only entitled to food and raiment. Wealth has been created for sacrifices; therefore one should employ it (or spend it) on pur pores of dharma and not on women, fools and irreligious people". Kāt. (852) and Bř. (S. B. E. 33 p. 371 verse 10 ) contain similar remarks. The Mit. does not accept this proposition, which argues that on that hypothesis no gifts ( apart from sacrifices) that are recommended by the śāstras will be possible, nor can one accom plish two of the puruşārthas 1156 viz, artha and kāma (as required by Gaut. IX. 46, Yāj. I. 115) and that the verses quoted above only moan that whatever wealth is collected for sacrifices should be spent only for that purpose even by the sons of the man who collected it, since a smsti text condemns generally everyone who does not spend wealth collected for a sacrifice for that purpose to becoming a crow or a bhāsu (a cock or water fowl) in the next life. The Mit. further argues that the view would be opposed to the conclusion of Jaimini 1II. 4. 20-24" that the Vedic injunction "one should wear gold on one's person" is merely puruşārtha and not 'kratrartha'.

The most famous passages on the grounds of exclusion from inheritance are Manu Ix. 201, Yaj. II. 140 and Nar. (dayabhaga, 21-82).

In नारद, the मिता., दायभाग, अपरार्क, दायतव and ध्य, प्र. read औपपातिका (which means 'one guilty of उपपातक'). Vide मनु.XI. 59-66 and विष्णुधर्मसत्र chap. 37 for long lists of उपपातकs such as गोषध, पारदार्य, अपाण्ययाजन &c. The स्मृतिच.

The मदनरत्न and व्य. मयूख p. 163 read अपयात्रित in नारद, while कल्पतरु read अपपात्रित and explained it as 'राज बधादिदोषेण बान्धवेयरय घटापवर्जनं कृतम्। (vide दायत). The मदनररन gave this very explanation for अपयात्रित. The वि. र. reads अपपात्रित (p. 489) and gives the same explanation of it as the कल्पतर. The ग्य. मयूख p. 163 says it is better to explain अपयात्रित (derived from यात्रा meaning ' sea voyage') differently, disapproves of the explanation of अपयावित given by the मदनरत्न on the ground that for one guilty of sedition or high treason the breaking of a jar or of excommunication is not prescribed and that our means 

one who goes to another continent or country by sea in a vessel for trade and the like'. Constantly engaging in sea voyage was one of the matters forbidden in the Kali age; vide 'द्विजस्थारधी तुनौयातु:शोधितस्याप्यसंग्रहः ' quoted by नीलकण्ठ, which verse is quoted as from आदित्यपुराण by हेमादि vol. III. 2 p.667. नीलकण्ठ is wrong about high treason. गौतम (20. 1-4) declares that one should desert even one's father who is guilty of regicide and describes a ceremony in which an unclean vessel is brought by a slave or servant from a dost heap and is filled with water from a jar carried by a female slave and than the vessel is struck with the foot and emptied with the words' 'I make

Persons excluded from share

entitled to no share". Yaj. II. 140 declares that the impotent, the outcast and his son, a lame man, a mad man, an idiot, a blind man and one afflicted with an incurable disease are not entitled to a share. It will be noticed that Yāj. expressly excludes the son of an outcast, as do also Baud. and Devala. Nār. (dāyabhāga 21-22) says 'one hostile to his father, an outcast (patita ), an impotent person, one who goes to another continent by sea (from India Lome these even though they be aurasa sons shall not get a share; how can a kşetraja ( a son of the wife raised by another person by appointment) get a share ( if he has these defects) and persons afflicted with long standing. (like phthisis) and severe diseases (like leprosy ), persons who are either idiots, insane or lame-these must be maintained by the family, but their sons are entitled to a share'. These verses of Manu, Yaj. and Nār have been quoted and explained in numerous decisions of the courts in India, but all such cases are mostly of academic inte rest now since the passing of the Hindu Inheritance (Disabi lities Removal) Act of 1928 and hence need not be dwelt upon here. The Act ( XII of 1928 ) applies to the whole of British India except to persons governed by the Dāyabhāga school and provides that no person governed by the Hindu Law, other than a person who is and has been from birth a lunatic or idiot, shall be excluded from inheritance or from any right or share in joint family property by reason only of any disease, deformity or physical or mental defect. This Act is not retrospective and does not confer on any person any right in respect of any religious office or service or any right to the management of any religious or charitab!: trust which he would not have had before the Act. Therefore under the Act the only defects that would disqualify a person governed by the Mitākṣarā school from claim. ing partition or inheritance are congenital lunacy and congenital idiocy. Under the Dāyabhāga school the grounds of exclusion will still remain as before except as modified by judicial deci sions and by other Acts. An important question under the Mit. school arises in this way. What is the exact position of a son that is congénitally idiotic or insane. Both Manu (IX. 201 and 203) and Yāj. ( II, 140, 141) declare that they are anarsa or nirantaka ( not entitled to a share of the ancestral estate ), but must be given maintenance and if maintenance be not given by those who are liable to give it, they would incur sin ( as Manu IX. 202 expressly says) and that the song of disqualified parsons take a share, if they are themselves free from defects. If A has a son B who is congenitally idiotio, is B still a copar:612

coner of A (though not entitled to a share or to claim partition) so that A cannot make a gift of the whole or a portion of the property or a bequest thereof to his widow? This question arose in Amirthammal v. Vallimayil I. L. R. (1942) Mad. 807 ( F. B.), where it was decided that, when A made a will in the above circumstances bequeathing all family property absolutely to his widow and two sons were born to the disqualified man B after A's death, the father had no power to make a will as the disqualified member B was still a coparcener (though not entitled to a share) and that he transmitted the heritage to his sons. The chief ground of the decision was a passage of the Sarasvativilāsa (explained on pp. 817 and 828-830) which is quoted below 1159, 

The grounds of disqualification apply to males and females alike, as stated by the Mit. on Yāj. II. 140 1160. A few remarks will be made on pulita and his son. The commission of every sinful act. did not make one patita as the word was technically understood. There were various grades among sins, which will be described in the section on pūtakas. The grave sins were differently enumerated by different ancient writers. In explaining 1161

P. 364. The S. V. does not appear to be laying down any novel proposition. All that this passage appears to mean is that though these disqualified persons cannot themselves enjoy a share, yet they do have a share (in theory) and if they can marry or are eligible for marriage their sons that are free from defects do take a share and that one cannot lay down a sweeping proposition that all congenitally dumb or insane persons or idiots can marry, but that there are degrees in these defects and in certain extreme circum. stances these disqualified persons cannot marry.

Grave sins 

Rg. X. 5.6 " the wise made seven boundaries (restrictions) by transgressing even any one of which a man becomes sinful", the Nirukta VI. 27 enumerates the seven sins as "theft, violat ing the bed (of the guru.), murder of a brāhmaṇa, murder of a bhrûña, continual performance of sinful acts, telling a lie as to a sinful matter". In the Tai. S. II. 5. 1. I., Sat. Br. XIII. 3.1. 1. and other Brahmana texts, the murder of a brāhmaņa seems to have been regarded as the gravest of all sins ( vide H. of Dh. vol. II. p. 147 and n. 333 ). In the Chāndogya 1162 Up. V. 10. 9 the five great sinners are declared to be the thief of gold, the drinker of liquor, the violator of the guru's bed, the murderer of a brāhmaṇa and one who associates with them. Gaut. (XXI. 1-3) declares that the murderer of a brāhmaṇa, the drinker of liquor, one guilty of sexual intercourse with the wife of his guru (elder or teacher ) or with women who are the eapiņdas of his father or mother, a thief (who steals a brāhmaṇa's gold), an atheist, one who continually does forbidden acts, one who does not abandon a palita (son or the like through affection) and one who deserts his relations though they are not patita are palitas and so is one who incites another to commit & grave sin and also one who associates with a patita for a year (as regards a vehicle, a seat and bed). Ap. Dh. 8. (1. 7. 21. 8-11) contains a longer list of grave sins (pataniya ). Vas. (I. 19-21) states that there are five grave sins ( mahāpātukas) viz. violating the bed of the guru, drinking liquor, murder of a learned brāhmaṇa, robbing a brāhmaṇa of gold and contact with a patita by being his teacher or pupil or priest or by contracting a matrimonial alliance with him. The Baud. Dh. S. II. 1.50-56 has a somewhat different list of pataniya actions viz. sea voyage, robbing a brāhmaṇa of his wealth and misappropriating a deposit, per jury for land, trading in (forbidden ) articles, service under a südra and having a child from a södra woman, Manu XI. 54, Yāj.

Samsarga or saryoga ( contact or association) was of various kinde. Manu XI. 180 ( = Sānti 165.37 = Baud. Dh. S. II, 1. 88= Vas. 1.22 ) states that a person who associates with a patita for a year as regards using the same vehicle or seat or taking food with him in the same row becomes patita ; but he becomes patita at once by being his sacrificial priest or by being his teacher of the Veda or by entering into 1163 a matrimonial alliance with him. Vrddha-Bphaspati 1164 ( quoted by Mitākşarā on Yaj. III. 261 ) states that association ( sankara ) with a patita is of nine kinds viz. occupying the same seat or bed, taking dinner in the same row with him, cooking food in his cooking pots, partaking of cooked food prepared by him, being a sacri ficial priest or employing him as a priest, being his teacher of the Veda or making him one's teacher of the Veda, giving him one's daughter in marriage or taking his daughter in marriage, taking food with him in the same pot. Devala 1165 declares that sin is passed on from one man to another by conversation (with a sinner ), by touching him, by his breath (coming in close contact with one's nose ), by occupying the same vehicle (horse) or seat, by eating (in his company ), by being a priest for him or by making him one's priest, by being his teacher of Veda or making him one's teacher or by matrimonial alliance. The same causes that led to a male being patita operated in the cage of a woman to make her patita; there was one additional cause viz a woman became patita by sexual connection with a male of a lower class than herself (Gaut, 21. 9, Yaj. III. 297 and Saunaka 1166). The ancient sages were very considerate even

to fallen women. They provide that even women that are patita and have not yet performed the proper penance were not to be cast on the streets, but they were to be given a hut ( near the house ) for residence and bare maintenance that would keep body and soul together and were to be guarded against further lapses ( Yaj. III. 296). Vide H. of Dh, vol. II pp. 571-573. 

How far unchastity will debar a female from inheritance will be discussed a little later on, Adultery in general was an upapātaka only according to Manu XI. 59 and the ordinary penance for it was cāndrāyana or govrata (Manu XI. 117 ). But if the adultery was with a person of low caste, the woman became palita and would not have been entitled to a share on partition ( as a wife or mother) under the old Hindu Law. 

In the case of those guilty of grave sins who did not perform the prayaścittas prescribed for such sins there was a peculiar procedure called ghatasphota prescribed for excommuni cating them and severing all connection with them and treating them as dead, which has been described in H. of Dh. vol. II p. 388. Vide Gaut. 20. 2-7, Manu XI. 182-184, Yāj. III. 294. But when the sinner performed the appropriate prāyaścitta (penance), the smrtis declare that he became fit to be associated with (vyavahārya), he was to be welcomed by his relatives who were to take a bath along with him in a holy river or the like and who were to throw in the water an unused jar filled with water, he should offer grass to cows in the midst of his relations, they were not to find fault with him later on, Vide Manu XI. 186-187, Yāj. III. 295, 299, Vas. 15. 20, Gaut. 20-10-14 ( which prescribes the recital of certain Vedic mantras and the offering of clarified butter into fire). Āp. Dh, S. 1. 9. 24. 24-25 and I. 10. 29. 1-2 prescribe for the sinner who kills a guru or & śrotriya that has performed soma sacrifice or a bhruna certain observances till death, but declare that such a person can never get rid of the logs of the right of association with all people, that there is no return for him to his relatives. 1167 In the Nirnaya sindhu (III Uttarardha pp. 567-68) and in the Dharmasindhu (III Uttarardha pp. 453–54 ) the rite of ghatasphoța for a patita and the rite for taking him back are concisely described. 1168 - The smrtis state that when a man knowingly committed a sin, penances did not necessarily remove the otherworldly con

sequences of the sin altogether but the ginner became fit to be associated with (Yaj. III. 226). In the case of the patita, even his son born after he committed a grave sin was held to be patita by inost writers of smrtis ( Yāj. II, 140, Vigpu Dh. S. 15. 35-36, Kaut III. 5 ) 1169. But in the case of the daughter a difference was mercifully made. Vas. ( 13. 51-53 )1170 states "the sages say that one born of a patita becomes a patita, except a female child, since she is to go to another (person as his wife ); one may marry her without accepting any wealth (of her patita father) along with her". Yāj. III. 261 also says that the daughter of a patita may be married after making her fast and after making her leave everything ( belonging to the patita father ) in her father's house. Visvarūpa ( on Yāj. III. 257 ) quotes a prose passage from Hārita to the following effect : the daughter of a patita should have fasted one day and night, should take a bath without clothes, should put on white and new garments in the morning, should loudly repeat thrice 'I do not belong to him (my patita father) nor is he anyone to me' and then she inay be married at a sacred place (river etc.) or in one's (the bridegroom's ) house. 

These rules about a patita led to this result that if a Hindu changed his religion or was excommunicated or was made an outcast for some lapse that his caste looked upon with great disfavour, he was deemed to have lost his rights of partition or inheritance. The Caste Disabilities Removal Act (XXI of 1850) abrogates these rules of the ancient 1171 Hindu Law.

Rights of disqualified persons 

617 

All the smrtis say that those who are deprived of their rights to partition on socount of the several defeats mentioned ama antitled to maintenance out of the family property 28. long as they are alive (Gauten 28. 41, Vas 17. 54, Vişnu Dh. S. 15. 33, Manu. IX. 202, Yaj. II. 140 etc.). If the disqualified persons want to marry or are married, then their sonless wives that are chaste should be maintained (Yaj. II. 142), but those that are unchaste should be driven out and so also those wives that are hostile to the family ; but the Mit. adds that even hostile wives of disqualified heirs must be maintained provided they are chaste. If the disqualified person has an aurasa son or kşetraja son 1171, who is free from the defects mentioned above (such as impotence) he becomes entitled to & share of the joint family property and the daughters of dis qualified persons are entitled to be maintained in the family and provision must be made for their marriages (Manu IX. 203, Yāj. IL 141). It follows that disqualified heirs could not adopt, since Yaj. II. 141 mentions only aurasa and kşetraja sons. Many of the smrtis did not allow even maintenance to the patita and his son ( vide Baud. Dh. S. II. 2. 46, Kauţ. III. 5, Devala, Vişnu Dh, S. 15. 35-36 ). Coparoeners were prevented from claiming a share at a partition if at the time of the partition they were labouring under the defects mentioned above. But if after partition 1172 the defect which disqualified a member be

removed by medical treatment or the like then the disqualified member was entitled to reopen the partition on the analogy of a posthumous son born after partition. So also if a person is quite free from defect when he takes at a partition a share in joint family property or inherits, subsequently supervening defect does not divest the property once vested in him. 

Some of the emptis contain rules that appear to be only recommendatory. Ap. Dh.1173 S. II. 6. 14. 15 says that if even the eldest son or brother were to waste joint wealth in immoral or improper ways he should be given no share ( by the father or brothers at a partition). To the same effect are Gaut. 28, 38 and Manu IX. 214. 

Gaut. 28. 43 and Vişpu Dh. S. 15. 37 provide 1174 that the song of pratiloma unions (i, e. of a man with a woman of a higher class ) are to be dealt with like the sons of a brāhmaṇa from a šūdra woman i. e. they would be entitled to maintenance from their father, though pratiloma unions were condemned. Kat. (862-864) provides that the son of a woman married out of her order, one who is born of a sagotra union and one who is an apostate from the order of ascetics do not obtain ancestral wealth; but the son of a woman married in the wrong order takos the ancestral wealth if he is of the same class as his father, and the son of a woman who is not of the same caste as the husband (but of a lower caste ) and is married in the proper order takes the wealth of the father. But the son of a woman

The word WAATETUS is interpreted in two ways: (1) If a brāhmana married a kpatriya girl first and then married a brāhmaṇa girl, both womon became M ATOT (as the procedure was against Manu III, 12). The son of the kşa triya woman in such a case did not take the wealth of his father but only the son of the other woman took it. The other ioterpretation (given by the UETTATT) is based upon the dootrine of ofte , for which vide H, of Dh. vol. II. PP. 346-549 and Manu. III, 172.

Marriage expenses of brothers and sisters

united with a man in the reverse order of castes does not take the ancestral estate ; but the approved view is that he should be given food and raiment till his death by the kinemen. In case there are no kinsmen such a son takes the whole wealth of his father and if the father left no wealth kingmen are not bound to maintain him. 

Provision must also be made before ordering partition in a suit for partition by a brother for the marriage expenses of the unmarried sister or sisters of the brothers. Here there has been a great divergence of views among the writers of digests and commentaries. Kaut. III.5 (quoted below in n. 1181), Vişụu Dh.9.18. 35 and 15. 31 and Bț, simply state that wealth for the marriago expenses of the unmarried sisters must be set apart. But Manu IX, 118, Yāj. II. 124 and Kat. ( 858 ) 1175 state that the brothers should get their unmarried sisters married by giving them one fourth share. The Mit. explains 1176 that this does not mean that each brother is to give one fourth of his share to the sister ( for in that cage if there are five brothers and one unmarried sister she may get more than each brother) but that the unmarried sister is to get one fourth of what she would have got if she were a male and that if a person has sons and daughters from wives of different classes then the unmarried daughter of the wife of each class will take one fourth of what her brother from the same mother would have taken. The Mit. further adds that one should not explain that the word " one fourth" is not to be taken literally and that the unmarried sister gets only as much as is necessary for her marriage, since such an explana tion is opposed to the express words of Manu IX. 118 and since Manu declaress sinfulness as the consequence of not giving one fourth share. The Mit, informs us that its explanation was the same as that of Asahāya and Medhatithi and that Bharuci gave another explanation ( viz. that an unmarried sister was entitled to as much wealth as would be necessary for her

i Vol marriage and not to a definite sbare). The Dayabhaga held the opinion 1177 that if ancestral wealth was, small, the provision for the marriage of the unmarried daughter should be made by giving her a fourth share but if the wealth was ample then she should get only as much as was necessary for her marriage. The 8m. C., V. R. P. 494, V. O. p. 134 follow the view of Bharuci. while the V. M. (p. 106 ), Madaparatna and V. P. (p. 456 ff) follow the Mit. The former group particularly relies on the texts of Devala 11n (wealth necessary for marriage should be given to unmarrled daughters from the paternal estate ), Sankha ( when partition of heritage takes place the unmarried daughter takes the maidenly trinkets, wealth for her marriage expenses and stridhana ) and Vişnu Dh. S. 15. 31. In modern times the Courts allow no share to unmarried daughters but only provt slon for marriage expenses and this too is restricted to the unmarried sister of a person who requires or sues for partition and does not hold good as to the daughters of brothers or other collaterala 1179. In Bhagavati Shukul v. Ram Jatan 45 All. 297 it was held (at p. 299) that "quarter share" in the text means as much money as will suffice for marriage expenses and that where the daughter was a cripple and blind and all the property was worth Rs. 500 an alienation of the whole of it by the widowed mother for raising a dowry for the daughter was justifiable.

Before allotting shares provision must be made out of the jotnt family property for the payment of joint family debts 1879 for the personal debts of the father that are not immoral or Illegal, for small gifts of affection made by the father, the maintenance of disqualified coparoeners and female dependent members and for marriage expenses. Vide Manu VIII. 166 ( as to family debts), Yaj. II. 117, Nar. (dayabhaga 32) and Kst. 850 (for payment of father's debts and gifts of affection) and 542-43 ( for the various legal necessities 118). If brothers want to separate and some of them are already married and others are unmarried then provision must be made for the samskāras (such as marriages) of the latter from the joint family property. Even Kautilya makes provision for the inarriage of unmarried brothers and sistersun. Yaj. II. 124, Nar. ( dayabhaga 33), Br. (S. B.

It has already been seen that a father could during his life time separate his song from himself and also among them Belves 11831 and that he could assign shares of property to his song. This power of the father is indicated even in the Tai. 8. IIL 1. 9. 4 ( quoted above in note 1055 ) which refers to the story of Manu having distributed his wealth among his sons. It is argued by Ap. Dh. S. II. 6. 14. 11 that, as this Vedic text (Tai. S.) does not expressly state that any difference was made by Manu as to the shares of his sons, the division must have been equal, that therefore the preference of the eldest son is forbidden by the śāstras and that when the Tai. S. II. 5.2.7 states that "they distinguish the oldest by (a larger share of) the wealth " that is not a rule, but a mere anuvāda ( a statement of fact) and the Vedio passage only recites what some people do in spite of the rule of the gāstras. The general rule, in the absence of express provision to the contrary, is equal distribu tion, as stated in Jai. X. 3. 53 ( samain syād-asrutitvat) which is relied upon by the prima facie view in Mit. on Yāj. II. 265. From the Tai. S. it appears that both practices viz. equal division of property among all sons and giving a larger share to the eldest were wellknown in those far-off ages. Ap. II. 6.

betweep father and sons, a minor son is entitled to have provision made for his thread, betrotbal and marriage ceremonies out of the joint family pro perty before the property is partitioned. In Sundrabai v, Shiv Narayan 32 Bom. 81 it was held that marriage is one of the samskāras wbich both Yai. and Nārada refer to, la 38 Mad, 556 the same principle was establisbed. But la Venkatarayudu v. Sivaramkrishnayya 58 Mad. 126 and in Pran jivan v. Motiram 29 Bom. L. R. 1412 it has been held that the decisions in 38 Mad. 556 and in 31 Bom. 54 must be regarded as overruled by the P. C. decision in L. R. 49 I, A. 168, and in 58 Mad. 126 it was held that an unmarried brother is not entitled to bave provision made for his marriage in a decree for partition. It is submitted with great respect that these Madras and Bombay decisions are wrong so far as unmarried brothers are concerned, that they go against the express texts of several writers like Kautilya, Nārada, Bp., Visvarūpa, Madanapārijāta (p. 648) and that the Frivy Council in 49 1. A, 168 was dealing with the provision for marriages of the children of coparceners and not of brothers.

Special share for the eldest son 

623 

14. 7. clearly 1188 states that in some countries' gold or black corn or black produce of the earth is the ( special) share of the eldent. Almost all the sûtras and smrtis prescribe the rule of equal division among the sons of wives of the same class as the father (vide Ap. Dh, S. II. 6. 14. 1, Baud. Dh. S. II. 2. 2-3, Manu IX 156, Yaj. II. 117, Visņu Dh. S. 18, 36, Kaut. III. 5, Br. S. B. E. 33 p. 371 v. 10, Kāt. 838). Some of these no doubt refer to the special share or provision given to the eldest (called uddhāra). Kaut says " the father in a partition during his own life should not give a special share to one out of several sons, nor should he deprive a son of a share without any .cause 118 ( such as blindness etc.)." Kat. 843 says the same thing in almost the same words. But from certain passages when construed literally (such as Yaj. II. 116, Nār. dāyabhāga 15 ) it appears that the early Indian father often distributed the ancestral wealth among his sons just as he pleased. Nār. ( dāyabhāga 15)1185 says: "When a father has distributed his property amongst his sons that is a lawful distribution for them (and cannot be set aside ), whether the share of one be less or greater than or equal to the shares of the rest; for the father is the lord of all". To the same effect is Br. (8. B. E. vol. 33 p. 370 v. 4) who adde that if they try to alter the arrangement (made by the father) they shall be punished. But later on these passages were either held to apply to former ages ( V. Mayūkba p. 99 says 80 ) or to the self-acquired property of the father (Mit. on Yaj. II. 114 ) or were so interpreted as to mean that the partition made by the father could not be annulled if it was legal, but if illegal it could be set aside ( Mit, on Yāj. II. 116, Madanaratna, Madanapārijāta p. 646 ). Nār. ( dāyabhāga 16) himself denies authority to the father to give shares to the sons as he pleases

The eldest son has received special treatment in all ages down to modern times (vide p. 566 above). That treatment took various forms. Sometimes the texts say that the eldest son took the whole eatate. Ap. II, 6. 14. 6, Manu IX. 105-107, Nār. (dayabhāga 5) refer to this view. Manu (IX 105-107) allows the eldest son to take the entire paternal estate, provides that the other sons should depend for their maintenance on the oldest son as on the father, remarks that the oldest by the mere fact of his birth enables the father to free himself from the debt to the ancestors and that therefore he (the eldest) deserves to get from the father the entire estate. 1186 

Another mode of dealing with the privileges of the eldest son was to give him some excellent or valuable article and then to distribute the rest equally. The Tai. S. II. 2. 2. 7 seems to have been understood by Ap. Dh. $. II. 6.14. 1 and Baud. Dh. S. II. 2. 2-5 1187 in this sense. Manu IX. 114 says that the eldest may get the best of all the items of wealth, whatever is the most eminent and the best of a group of ten cattle. Br. (8. B. E 38 p. 371 verse 8) is to the same effect. Kaut. IIL 6 points out that according to Usana, among the sons born of the same mother, goats shall be the special share of the oldest among brāhmapas, horses among ksatriyas, Cows among vaisyas and shoop among sūdras, that if there be no quadrupeds. the eldest was to take an additional share of one-tenth of the whole property excepting procious stones, since be releases his father from føtten (of Hell ) by offering sraddha Kaut him solf holds that the eldest should got the vehicle and ornaments of his father after the latter's death }, the middle-most hig bad, best and the bropre plate from which the father took his meals, and the youngest should get black grain (Hke susame ),

iron, domestic utensils and the bullock cart. Hārsta 1188 says : "at a partition the eldest should get a bull, the most precious wealth, the images for worship and the ancestral house, the other brothers should go out and build new houses or if there be a single house the eldest should get the southern (or best) portion". This special allotment to the eldest is called uddhāra (lit. what is first taken out) in Manu IX. 115-116 and Visņu Dh. S. 18. 37, and Baud, employs the form "uddharet". There were other methods also prescribed for special distribution of wealth, Gaut. 28. 5 says that the eldest should get one-twentieth of the whole as a special share, a bull and a cow, a cow, a chariot to which horses, asses or mules are yoked and a bull. Manu IX. 112 provides that the special share of the eldest was one twentieth of the whole property and whatever was the most valuable out of the ancestral property, the middlemost son should get half of this ( i. e. one-fortieth part) and the youngest one-fourth of this (one-eightieth of the whole ). Manu IX. 117 states that when no valuable items are taken out for the eldest the latter should get two shares, the son next to him one share and a half and the other sons one share each. Vas. 17. 42, Nār. (dāyabhāga 13), Bp. (S. B. E, vol. 33 p. 371 verse 9 ) also give two shares to the eldest, the latter 1189 making it to depend on the possession of learning and good qualities by the eldest. Similarly Nār. (dāyabhāga 12), Br. (S. B. E. vol. 33 p.370 verse 5) provide 1190 that when the father makes a division during his lifetime he may retain two shares for himself. Sankha-Likhita allowed this right to the father only when he had an only son, 1191

In course of time there was a revulsion of popular feeling against allowing a special share to the eldest son and even to the father, Kāt. (838) 1192 states that where the parents and brothers divide the whole joint property in equal shares that is a just (or legal) division. Br. (S. B. E. 331193 p. 370 verse 2) declares that the father and sons are entitled to equal shares in lands and houses that are ancestral, but in property acquired by the father the sons cannot claim a share against the will of the father. The V. M. (p. 95) remarks on this that it follows impliedly that in the wealth acquired by the grand-father or other (remoter) ancestor, the sons can demand a partition even against the father's desire, 

____According to Manu IX. 125,1194 if all wives of a person are of the same caste, then the son who is born first (even from a wife who is junior i. e, married later ) is the eldest son and that among twins the one that is born first is the eldest (verse 126), just as in the Subrahmanya 1195 texts the invoca tion of Indra is made by the name of the first-born. But if he has wives of different castes then the son of the wife of his own caste is the oldest (though born later) and the son of a wife of a lower caste though born first would be postponed. Devala 11%a quoted in V. R. p. 477 and V. C. p. 128 says the

same as Manu IX, 125. Manu IX. 123 and Gaut. 28. 16 appear to conflict with Manu IX. 125 and probably refer to some other ancient text or opinion. The V. Mayūkha (pp. 97-98) notes that in some medical works and in the (commentary on the ) Bhāgavata Purāpa III. 17. 18, it is said that among twins the one born later is deemed to be the elder, but that this, being opposed to the indications contained in the Vedic Subrahmanya formula and in Manu IX. 126, has no bearing here (but only in medical matters ). The Nirnayasindhu (HII Pūrvārdha p. 251 ) makes a reference to the Bhagavata. 

General feeling went so much against allowing & special share to the eldest or allowing the father to make an unequal division among his song, that such action was condemned in the same breath with niyoga, 1196 or the sacrifice of the cow called Anubandhyā. It is very instructive to follow the agruments of the Mit. and other writers on this point. The oldest extant commentator, Medhātithi, on Manu IX. 112 shows that even before his time there were writers that held that the texts of Manu on niyoga and on the special share to the eldest at a partition were in vogue only in bygone days and not in their days, that the rules of the smrtis were conditioned by time and country, just as satłras of long duration, though declared in the Vedic texts committed to memory by Vedic students, were not being performed and just as Manu (I. 85 ) declares that the dharmas were different in different yugas. But Medhātithi 1199 does not accept this reasoning, denies that different dharmas are prescribed for different yugas and holds that there is no restriction as to the dharmas to be performed in a country. Though sattras may not be performed now still it is possible to perform them. The argument of the Mit. on Yāj.

II. 117 is briefly as followg1198-Unequal division though found in the sāstras (e. g. Manu IX. 105, 112, 116, 117, Yaj. II. 114) should not be practised because it has come to be condemned (or has become hateful to ) by the people, since there is the prohibition (in Yaj. L 156 ) that an action, though prescribed in the śāstras, should not be performed when it has come to be condemned by the people, since such an action does not lead to the attainment of Heaven. For example, though Yāj. I. 109 prescribes the offering of a big ox or a goat to a learned brahmaņa guest, it is not now practised because people have come to hate it; or just as, although there is a Vedic text laying down the sacrificing of a COW "one should sacrifice a barren cow called anubandhyā for Mitra and Varuņa", still it is not done because people condemn it. And it has been said "just as the practice of niyoga or the killing of the anubandhya cow is not now in vogue, so also division after giving a special share ( to the eldest son) does not now exist". Āpastamba also ( II. 6. 14. 1-14) prescribes equal division, refers to the view of some that the eldest takes the whole estate, shows that allotting a special share to the eldest is the view of some and refutes it as opposed to the śāstras by quoting the Vedic text "Manu divided his wealth among his sons". Therefore unequal division though found in the sāstra should not be practised as it is opposed to popular sentiments and to the Veda and so Yāj. (II. 117 ) gives the restrictive rule that in partitioning there must be equal divi sion, The Sm. C. (II. p. 266 ) tells us that Dhāreśvara also did not discuss passages like Manu IX. 112 since he said that - the practice (of uddhāravibhāga) had been altogether given up by the people 1199

Divergent views on uddhāra-vibhaga 

629 

The Sm.C. finde fault with Visvarūpa for saying that just as the offering of an ox or a goat to a learnod brāhmaṇa is not practised because the practice of the sistas is against it, 80 uddhāra is not practised. It says that when there is a conflict between a smrti text and diştācūra, the latter is the weaker ( of the two) and cannot refute the smộti text as laid down by Vas. 14-5. Further not offering a bull cannot be said to be sistācāra, but it is really the absence of sistā сāra. The Sm. C. finds fault with the Mit. for saying that people have come to condemn a special share for the eldest. It says that, on the contrary, if a special share is given to the eldest who is endowed with learn ing, good qualities or holy actions then people commend such a procedure. The Madanaratna 1200 quotes the verse “yatha niyoga &c.," and a verse from the Adipurāņa. The V. P. 1201 (pp. 442-443) generally follows the Mit., but criticizes it by saying that there is no real śruti-rirodha ( opposition to a Vedio text). If that were so, as śruti (the Veda) is promulgated for all ages, unoqual division would be forbidden in all ages and it would follow that the particular sruti passages speaking of

unequal division are without authority, since it (unequal divi sion) could not have been practised in other ages also (but as a matter of fact it was ); besides Baud. sets out another Vedic text which mentions unequal division. The V. P, desiring to guard against the rather wide statement that whatever is condemned by the people should not be practised holds that the word "loka" in Yāj. I 156 means "yuga "; otherwise there would be confusion about what is proper conduct and what does not lead to Heaven. The condemnation by low or ordinary people who are quite innocent of śāstras cannot make an action incapable of leading to Heaven, since such people might con demn the hiinsa ( slaughter ) of the animal offered to Agni and Soma. The above discussion illustrates how practices once recognized by Vedic passages and by the people gradually fell into disuetude and how reason and the common sense of ordinary people asserted themselves even against Vedic and smrti texts. The Mit. is very clear in its statement that whatever comes to be hated by the people in general should not be practised, even though it was once practised and has the support and authority of Vedic and smrti texts behind it, Those who desire change in social customs and the practices of the people in various directions rely on this text of Yaj. and on similar texts 1202 of Manu IV. 176 and Vişnu Dh. S. 71. 85 and on the Mit. for authority. Orthodox writers like Mitramitra therefore have to twist plain words like " loka", since they cannot tolerate the idea that common people can have anything to say in what these writers believe to be the injunctions of the sõstra. Instead of candidly saying that ancient practices came to be modified by common people, writers like Mitramiśta say that common people should not be listened to in these matters, that each yuga has its own peculiar practices and that common people have no authority to change gastric practices prescribed by the texts for a particular age: It is sheer quibbling to say that not offering a bull is not sistacara, but absence of siştācāra; what is clear is that common people abhorred the practice of niyoga and the killing of a cow in a sacrifice and writers of sütras and smrtis fell into line with them and probibited such practices in the

Vestiges of larger share to eldest son 

631 

Kali age, though they were either permitted or ( oven ) enjoined by the Vedic texts; that is, the voice of the common man or his revolt was allowed to prevail over the word of the sacred Veda. 

Though the assignment of a larger share to the eldest son or giving him the whole property ceased to be generally prevalent, vestiges of it are still found. There are certain estates in the nature of zamindaries or a rāj that are impartible and descend by the rule of primogeniture to a single heir. Vide Baboo Gunesh Dutta v. Maharaja Moheshur 6 Moo. I A. 164, Neelkisto v. Beer Chunder 12 Moo. L. A. 523, Mohesh v. Satrughan 29 I. A. 62, Ram Nundun v. Maharani Janki 29 L A, 178 for examples of impartible estates. Sometimes by custom certain estates such as Deshmukh and Deshpande valuns have been held to be impartible. Vide Ramrao v. Yeshvantrao 10 Bom. 327 and Gopalrao v. Trimbakrao 10 Bom. 598. In certain other cases a larger share ( called jyesthāṁsa or notap) has been allowed by custom to the eldest son at a partition, Vide Munikclund v. Hiralal 20 Cal. 45 (P. O.), Prithisingjā v. Umelsingji 6 Bom. L. R. 98, Malubhai v. Sursangji 7 Bom. L. R. 821. 

The following propositions may be laid down about the allotment of shares on a partition: (1) When there is a parti tion between a father and his sons each son takes a share equal to that of the father; (2) where the partition is only between brothers all of them share equally; (3) on the death of a member leaving male issue his right to a share on partition passes to and is represented by his male issue ; (4) when there is a partition among members who are uncles and nephews or cousins, the allotment is per stirpes (according to the stock) as regards each branch and per capita among the members of the same branch. This rule is expressly laid down 1203 by Kaut.

On these verses of TETT the ty. HY (p. 101 ) says that they do not refer to undivided coparceners, but rather to those who are re-united. Why it says so is not clear. The first verse of Kāt. starts with the words of wine and therefore the topic is that of undivided family and there is no express indication that it has changed to reunion in the following verse. The reason appears to be that it is takes the verse of देवल 'अविभक्तविभक्तानां कुल्यानां बसता सह । भूयो वायविभागः स्थादाचतुर्थादिति fputa: ' as referring to re-union on account of the word : in it.

Suppose A, the head of a Hipdu joint family, dies leaving four song, B, C, D, E and five grand-sons, B1, B2, B3, C1, D1 and then B dies. Then B3 receives his share, which is one third of one-fourth ( =one-twelfth ), goes out of the family and the rest oontinue joint. Then C dies, then D, then E, and thon B2. Then B 1 sues C1 and D1 for his share. Here if we again apply the rule of per stirpes division, the property that remained at the date of the suit of B1 will be divided into three parts and B1, C1 and D1 ( who represent three stocks, B, C, D) will each get one third of that property. This was so decided in Pranjivandas v. Ichharam 39 Bom. 734. The Madras High Court, however, holds that the rule of per stirpes applies only wlien all the coparceners desire a partition at the same time and that if only some members separate at one time and others on a later occasion, regard should be had to the share allotted at the first partition in computing the share to be allotted at the second partition. That is, according to the Madras High Court in the above case B1 will be entitled to one-third minus one twelth (which latter was allotted to B 3 when he left the family). The Madras High Court says that its views are based not on strict principles of Hindu Law, but on necessary con siderations of equity. Vide Manjunatha v. Narayana 5 Mad. 362 and Narayana v. Shankar 53 Mad. 1 (F. B. at p. 6). 

Manu (IX. 47) emphatically states : 12034 “once is a parti. tion made, once is a maiden given in marriage, once does a man say I shall make a gift of this or that'; these three are done only once by the good". This means that a partition once made is final and cannot ordinarily be reopened. But there are excep tions to this rule. One viz. about the posthumous son born after partition has already been mentioned above ( pp. 595-597 ). Bp. 1204 (S. B. E. 33 pp. 373-74 verses 24-26 ) says, “If a man

leaving the country common to himself and his co-sharors goes to another country, his share niust undoubtedly be given to his descendant when the latter comes back to the original country. Whether he (the descendant) be the third or fifth or even seventh in descent (from the man who left the country ) he would get the share that descends hereditarily provided his birth and family name are ascertained. The gotrajas ( agnatic members of the family) should allow (a share in the ancestral) lands to the descendant of a man whom the maulas and neighbours know to be a co-owner (in the lands) by descent, when he comes ( after a partition) to demand his share". The V. R. explaing 1205 that the rule of Devala (given above ) about a claim to a share being allowed up to the fourth applies when all the members stay together in the same place or country, while the above rule of Bṛ, allowing even the seventh in descent to claim his share after a partition has taken place applies where such descendant and his forefathers had migrated to a distant land. These rules of Br. indicate that, even after a long time, a descendant could claim his share in a joint family estate and no bar of limitation was allowed. 

Another rule is that where some property of the joint family had been fraudulently concealed by one member and was dis covered afterwards, or where some property was left out from partition either through mistake or accident, such property should be divided according to their shares among the persons who made the first partition. In this case there is no reopening of the partition once made, but there is another partition. Manu IX. 218, Yaj. II. 126, Kaut. III. 5 and Kāt. 885-86 laý down 1206 this.

is afterwards discovered, the sons should divide it equally with their brothers in the absence of the father (i. e: even after his death). Whatever is concealed from each other (by the co sharers ) or what was divided in an unjust manner and whatever was recovered (such as debts) after partition) should be 

partitioned in equal shares. This is the view of Bhrgu', 

In the Alt. Br. (VI. 7) 1207 It is said: 'He who deprives & person entitled to a share of his share, him he (who is deprived) punishes (or destroys). If he does not punish (or destroy ) him (the depriver), then he punishes his son or grandson; but he does punish him'. Manu IX. 213 declares that even the eldest brother who through grad deprives his younger brothers (of their shares ) ceases to be the eldest (1. e. forfeits his posi tion as the oldest), is deprived of his ( special) share (as eldest) and should be punished by the king. From these passages it follows that fraudulently concealing joint property or depriving a person of his share is condemned. This leads on to a divergence of views among commentators and digests. If a man conceals joint property at a partition, is he a wrongdoer or not? What he conceals is partly his own. Therefore the Dayabhāga 1208 (XIII. 8) holds that there is no theft in this case, since a thief is commonly understood to be one who knowing that some thing belongs to another, makes it his own without any ground for so doing; while a co-sharer cannot be said to be no owner at all of the joint property. The Dayabhāga (XII. 11-12) says that Visvarūpa and Jitendriya both held the same opinion that even if technically it may be called theft, still there is no sin attaching to it as smrtis allow bim also who conceals joint property to share in it at the subsequent partition, The Vivādaratnākara (p.526) states that Halāyudha also held the opinion that in suppressing some joint property the co-sharer did not incur the sin of theft. On the other hand the Mit., Apararka (p. 732), V. P. p. 555 hold that in view of Manu IX. 213

Concealment of joint property 

637 

(which declares even the oldest as punishable by the king if he deprives his younger brothers of their due share ) and the Ait. Br. there is the fault of theft in case a co-sharer fraudulently conceals joint property. The Mit, and V. P. further rely upon an example derived from the Pūrvamimārsā in support of their view. When a caru (boiled food) of mudga pulse is prescribed and mudgas are not available, some substitute must be employed just as when rice is not available nivara grain may be employed. The parts of māsa resemble those of mudga and some one may plausibly say that in the absence of mudgas, a caru of masas may be used. To this Jai. VI. 3. 20 1209_replies that, since maşas, varakas and kodravas are forbidden as being unfit for use in sacrifices, one cannot take parts of māsas as substitute for parts of mudgas though both may be so similar as not to be easily distinguishable. So the general prohibition against depriving another of his wealth holds good even in the case of goods that belong jointly to oneself and to others. The Dayabhāga (XIII. 16 pp. 227-228) tells us that a predecessor of it named Balaka relied on this very nyāya of Jaimini and finds fault with him. It should be noted however that Kat. (888) re commends that the king 1210 even if a complaint be lodged about fraudulent suppression by a co-sharer should not use force against the fraudulent suppressor but should make him give up the concealed property by persuasion or trick, Bp. and Kāt. 1711 declare that if there is a suspicion that some joint wealth has been concealed by a co-sharer, the kota ordeal may ba resorted to.

. If there was a dispute whether a partition had already taken 

place, Yaj. II. 149 mentions some of the indications that lead to the inference or proof of partition viz. 'the determination of the dispute follows from the testimony of kinsmen, cognates (like maternal uncle), other witnesses, a deed (of partition) and by ( the fact of ) houses and fields being separately held.' Nār. ( dayabhāga 36-41 ) gives more 1112 elaborate rules on the subject viz, that the status of division can be determined from the fact of their transactions ( agriculture &c.) being separate, that the separate performance of religious rites is another indication of separation. “Receiving and returning a debt, the beasts (kine &o.), food, houses and fields and servants must be separate in the case of those who are divided, as also cooking food, performance of religious rites, income and expenditure. It is only divided persons ( and not undivided ones) that can become in respect of each other witnesses, sureties or debtors and creditors. People should regard them to be divided even though there be no deed of partition, in whose case these transactions are entered into openly with their co-sharers'. Yāj. II. 52 also declares that between brothers, husband and wife, father and gon there cannot be, as long as they are undivided, the relation ship of being sureties or witnesses for each other or of being debtor and creditor. Nar. ( dāyabhāga 41 ) and Kāt. ( 893 ) state that when for ten years brothers (and other members of a family) reside (separately) doing religious observances separately and have separate transactions, they should be known as separate so far as the ancestral estate is concerned. 1213 It is on account of these passages that the courts say that presumably every Hindu family is joint in food, worship 1214 and estate and that cesser of commensality is an element which may properly be considered in determining the question whether there has been

Self-acquired property

a partition of joint family property, but it is not conclusive 185 Bp, says that where there are no witnesses nor a document to prove partition, a conclusion may be arrived at by inference, 

A few words may be said about the self-acquired property of the father or grand-father. According to the strict theory of the Mit. the son 1316 acquires by birth an interest even in the self-acquired property of the father, but the Mit, makes it clear that the son has no power to prevent his father from disposing of his own self-acquisitions, but has to give his approval to his father's alienations of his self-acquisitions, The Mit. sets out two smrti texts viz.' though immovable property and bipeds may have been acquired by the father himself, there can be no gift nor sale of them without (calling together or ) consulting all the sons. Those that are born, those that are unborn and those that are in their mother's ) womb expect maintenance (and therefore ) there can be no gift nor sale'. But these have been treated by the Mit, and the Dayabhaga also as more or less recommendatory. If the father alienates his self-acquisitions without his son's consent he may be held guilty of transgressing a smrti precept but the transaction does hold good and is valid, 1217 since a fact cannot be altered by even a hundred texts ( as the Dāyabhāga puts it). It should not be supposed that the Mit. was the first to propound this right as to self-acquisitions. Centuries before, the Vişnu Dh. 8. 17. 1 expressly declared that as regards self-acquired property the father has absolute discretion to divide it as he pleases.

Kat. (839) also says that the son has no ownership in the father's self-acquisition. 118 When Yaj. II. 114 allows the father either to give the best share to the eldest son or to make an equal division among all sons, the Mit. explains that this unequal division holds good only as to the self-acquisitions of the father. Similarly when Nār. (dāyabhaga 12 ) or Sankha-Likhita say that the father may take two shares for himself, that is with reference to se]fwacquisitions, acc. to the Mit. Manu IX. 104 stating that sons have no power over property during the life of the parents refers to the self-acquisitions of the parents. In modern times courts have followed the view that a Hindu father (or any Hindu person whatever ) may give, sell or bequeath by will his self acquired property ( whether movable or immovable) to any body he likes ( vide Rao Balwant Singh v. Rani Kishori 25 I. A. p. 54 at pp. 67-68 where the two verses cited by the Mit. were held to contain only a moral precept and not a rule of law capable of being enforced ). 

Mr. Kishori Lal Sarkar in his Tagore Law Lectures on the Mimāngā rules of interpretation states (p. 21 ) that 'Mitakşarā bears the imprens of Buddhistic influence'. For this proposition he advances hardly any substantial evidence that will bear scrutiny. His reasons are mostly subjective and he refers to no ancient or medioval Buddhistic texts that elaborate the principle of taking property by birth or the rule of propinquity in deciding questions of inheritance, which two are the most fundamental, tenets of the Mitakşarā system. It appears that the evolution of the son's right to partition, of his equality with his father, of the absolute rights of a person to his self acquisitions was a gradual indigenous growth and had nothing to do with Buddhistio thought. Buddhists had hardly any independent set of juristic ideas or works different from those of the Brahmanioal jurists and in medieval times countries like Burma professing Buddhism turned to Brahmanic codes like that of Manu for regulating succession, inheritance and allied

In the preceding pages reference las been frequently made to sons, to their rights in ancestral property by birth and to their shares on partition. It is now time to refer to the various kinds of sons, principal ( mukhya) and gauna (subsidiary or secondary ). 

In H. of Dh, vol. II. pp. 560-561 passages from the Rgveda, the Tai, S., Sat. Br., Ait. Br., the sūtras and smrtis emphasizing the importance of a son for the spiritual welfare of a man have been cited. The principal purposes served by the birth of a son are succinctly stated in the Ait. Br. 33. 1. viz. the son enables the father to pay off the debt he owes to his ancestors, to secure immortality (ammtatva ) and heavenly worlds. These were the main purposes deemed to be served by a son in most remote times. Manu (IX. 106-107 ) and Yāj. I. 78 also mention these benefits. The desire was to continue and perpetuate the family (vaméasya avicchedah as the Mit. has it) and to provide for the performance and preservation of religious sācra and offerings. This desire was common in ancient societies almost everywhere. The Sat. Br. XII. 4.3.1 (S. B. E. vol. 44 p. 157) states the father in later life subsists on the son and the son in early life subsists on the father'. The Nirukta 1220 (III. 4) quotes a ?k verge thou

art börn from each of the limbs, from the heart ( of the father ), thou art indeed one's own self called son; mayst though live for a hundred autumns!'. Gradually the idea arose ( probably suggested by etymologists) that the son saved the father from the Hell called put, 1221 as stated by Manu IX. 138 (=Adiparva 229. 14 = Visnu Dh. S. 15. 44). The son's close connection with the offering of pipdas to the ancestors is not much emphasized in the oldest works. But in the sūtras, in Manu and the other smrtis this aspect of the benefits derived from the son is far more prominent than the others. In speaking of the putrika putra Manu (IX. 136 ) declares 'he should offer pinda' (to his maternal grandfather ) and take the latter's wealth. As three descendants (son, grandson and great-grandson) presented pindas to the ancestor, all three had extravagant praises besto wed on them. Manu IX. 137 says: 'a man secures the ( higher) worlds through (the birth of ) a son, he obtains permanence (in those worlds ) through a grandson, through the son of a grandson he wins the world of the Sun '1222, The Vişnudharma sūtra 85. 67 declares1223 ' A man should desire to have many song (with the thought) that some one out of them may go to Gayā or offer the Aśvamedha sacrifice or let loose ( in honour of the deceased father ) a dark bull'.

I. % p. 305 ) states: 'the pitřs afraid of falling into Hell desire to have sons; (they think ) one of them may go to Gay, and that one will save us; he will set at liberty a bull, he may perform sacrifices and execute works of public utility (like tanks, temples and parks ), he will take care of us in our old age, he will offer srāddha day by day'.

they expect their descendants to do such as offering water in holy rivers, sraddhas, going to Gaya, gifts of various kinds, construction of tanks, &o. 

It is not, however, to be supposed that purely secular bene fits to be derived from sons were not thought of at all. People were alive to them but those benefits were submerged under the flood of extravagant ideas about the spiritual benefits derived froin sons. For example, the Br. 1224 Up. I. 5. 16, after mention ing the three worlds of men, pitts and gods, declares that the world of men can be won only through the son ( while in I. 5.17 there is eulogy of the son and instruction to him that he is Brahma, he is yajña, he is the heavenly world). Nār. IV. 5 says 1225 "fathers wish to have sons on their own account think ing in their hearts . He will free me from low and high debts'". Kāt. (551) has a similar verse and makes the meaning of Nār, clear 1236 Vide above (under ppādāna pp. 416-417). 

Besides the aurasa, eleven or twelve kinds of subsidiary sons are mentioned by most ancient smrti writers. Ap. Dh. S. does not recognize any son except the aurasa. Āp. quotes certain verses which express the view of an ancient sage called Aupajanghani and which are also quoted by the Baud. Dh. S. according to which the aurasa was to be recognized as the only son (vide H. of Dh. Vol. II. p. 602 n. 1417 for the quotation) Āp. II. 5. 13. 10 emphasizes that there can be no real gift or sale of one's child ( dānam krayadharmascāpalyasya nu vidyate). But Ap. Dh. S. clearly shows that it know that køetraja sons were

In II. 10. 27. 2-6 Āp. condemns the practice of niyoga 'a husband (or his elders ) shall not appoint a wife who occupies the position of a sagotra to others (who are not sagotra), for they declare that a bride is given to the family ( of the husband and not to the husband alone ). This (practice of appointment) is forbidden (now) on account of the weakness of (men's ) senses. The hand of even a sagotra is ( deemed in law to be ) that of a stranger, as well as that of any other person (except the husband).

Viṛpu Dh. 8. (15. 27) mentions yatra-kvacanotpadita' (procreated anywhere ) as the 12th and last. The com. Vaijay anti explains it in two ways: (1) procreated by a person on a woman, regardless of whether she is his own or another's wife or whether she is of the same caste or not, whether she is married or unmarried, whether her marriage has been consummated or not; (2) the son of a man from a sūdra woman not married to him. Even in the last sense he cannot be called sandra ( whom Manu IX. 178 and Yāj. I. 91 de fine as the son of a südra wife from a brāhmaṇa ). Hārita as quoted in the V. R. p. 549 men tions a son called 'sahasā dřgta '( seen by chance ), who seems to be probably the same as kftrima. The saudra is omitted by several writers (even ancient ones ) like Gautama, Kautilya and Hārita. Manu speaks of only twelve sons (IX. 158) and does not enumerate the putrikāputra among them, though he speaks of the putrikā (IX. 127 and 134 and elsewhere ) as equal to the son. It is therefore that Br. ( S. B. E. 33 p. 375 verse 33 ) states that of the thirteen sons mentioned in succession by Manu the legitimate son of the body ( aurasa ) and the putrikā (the daughter appointed as a son) continue 'the family. Vas. 17.12 emphatically declares (dvādata ityeva putrāḥ purūnadrştah) that only twelve sons have. been noticed by the ancient (sages) and it is no doubt true that most writers generally enumerate twelve. A smrti text quoted by Haradatta on Gautama and by the Dattaka-mimamsā mentions 15 kinds of song. Vide note below 1229 The number is arrived at by counting the putrika

( daughter appointed as a son ) and the putrikāputra ( the son of the appointed daughter ) as two, dividing the kşetraja into two viz, as the son of the begetter (bijin) and as the son of the wife (i. e. of the husband of the wife ) and the son produced any where ( as mentioned by Visņu Dh. S.) is 15th and the last. The Parāśarasmrti (IV. 23-24) mentions, besides Kunda and Golaka, only five kinds of song, 

It is necessary, before proceeding further, to give brief definite ions of the twelve or thirteen kinds of sons from Manu and other writers. The legitimate son (aurasa) is one begotten by a man on his own wedded wife of the same caste. The putrikāputra 1230 is of two kinds; (1) a sonless man may appoint his daughter as his son ( she is then called putrikā and treated as a son ); (2) or she may be given to a person in marriage with the stipulation 'I. give you in marriage this brotherless girl decked with orna ments; the son born of her will be my son'. In this case the son born of the daughter so given becomes the son of his mater nal grandfather. The kşetraja (the son of the wife ) is one who is begotten on a man's wife (or widow ) by a sagolra ( agnatic kinsman) or by one not of the same gotra, according to the rules of niyoga, when the man himself is either dead or impotent or suffering from (an incurable ) disease. That is the son given (dattaka or dattrima ) whom his father or mother gives as a son affectionately in a time of distress with water and who is of the same caste ( as the adopter). He is the son called kştrima (made ) whom a man makes his son, the latter being of the same caste, being clever in distinguishing between right and wrong and being endowed with the qualities a son should POSBOBs. He is the son born secretly (güdhotpanna or gūdhaja as he is called by Baud, and Yāj.), who is born in a man's house, it being not known who is his begetter; and he belongs to him of whose wife he is bora. He is the son called apaviddha (cast off ) whom a man receives as his son after he has been abandoned by his parents or by one of them. The kūnina ( mai den's son ) is one whom a maiden bears secretly in the house of her father and he belongs to him who marries her afterwards.

The sahodha (received together with the bride ) is the son born of a woman who was pregnant at the time of marriage, whether that fact was known or unknown (to the person marrying hor) and he belongs to the person who weds the (pregnant) woman, The krita ( son bought ) is one who is bought by a person from his father and mother for making the boy his son, whether the boy be equal or unequal (in qualities ). The paunarbhava ( the son of a remarried woman) is one to whom a woman, being aban doned by her husband or being a widow, gives birth after she contracts a second inarriage of her own accord. He, who, having lost his parents or being abandoned by them without proper cause, gives hinself to a man ( as a son) is called svayardattu (a son self-given). The son whom a brāhmaṇa begets through lust from a südra wife is called pāraśava (or saudra ), since he, though living, is (like a ) corpse. 

The list of twelve or thirteen kinds of sons looks rather formidable, has puzzled and misled even great scholars into making all sorts of sweeping assertions and putting forward untenable theories about the origin and necessity of so many song. For example, Dr. Jolly in his ' Recht und Sitte' (English tr. p. 156 ) observes. The twelve kinds of sonship, which to some extent are based on the illicit connection of the mother and for the greater part have nothing to do with the blood-relationship of the son with the father, are probably the most striking feature of Indian family law. The cause of this abnormal importance being attached to male issue is to be sought, according to the smrtis, in the offering of sacrifices to the manes which depends upon the male issue; yet, however, originally an economic motive was perhaps a more important factor in it-to get for the family as many powerful workers as possible'. The learned writer appears to hold that the smstis regarded all the secondary sons as equally competent to confer spiritual benefit and that at one and the same time a man could have all or most of them As song. But he is mistaken in both these respects. The very definition of putrikāputra, kşetraja 1231 and dattaka given by many of the smptis show that one who has already an aurasa

son, grandson or great-grandson could not have a putrikaputra, a kşetraja or an adopted son. If the definitions of all the 1% or 13 kinds of sons are carefully analysed, it will be quite apparent that the long list is due to the ancient writers' great penchant for divisions and sub-divisions based upon very slight differences of circumstances. The several kinds can be classi fied into three or four groups as done by Devala, 1232 All the five sons called duttaka, krita, kştrima, svayandatta and apaviddha are sons who are affiliated by a person under various circumst ances. There is no tinge of any illicit connection of the mother in any one of these, the one thing common to all of them being that they are the sons of one man and are treated by another as his. Similarly the paunarbhava and saudra are the legal sons of the man himself, but there is opprobrium attaching to them, because in the first case the mother contracted a re marriage ( which was very much condemned by the smrtis ) and in the other a brābmana married a südra woman ( which also was looked down upon, if not absolutely forbidden as done by Yāj. I. 56). The paunarbhava son of a dvija is still called a dvija by Manu III. 181, but Manu only provides that he is not fit to be invited at a sraddha. The putrika ( the daughter appointed as a son ) is the man's own child and the putrika putra also is the man's own grandchild and both these are special cases of adoption and no question of mother's illicit connection arises in these. So out of 13 kinds of sons, nine were entirely free from any taint of illicit connection. There remain only the four viz, kşetraja, gūdhotpanna, kānina, sahodha. The kşetraja was in a class by himself and was & survival of an ancient practice prevalent in many countries all the world over, which had been condemned in India by Ap. ( as shown above on p. 644) and his predecessors several centuries before the Christian era. It may, however, be pointed out that some medieval writers held the view that several secondary sons like the dattaka, krita &o. could be had by a man having no auraga son. 12324

(Vol. 

The chief concern of the smrtis as shown clearly by the Anusāganaparva (chap. 49 quoted above on p. 645 ) and the com. of Nilakantha was to provide for the maintenance and the performance of the baṁskaras of those children that may be either abandoned by their parents or may be under the oloud of illegitimacy. 

There is great confusion and contradiction among the sūtras and smrtis about the place of the several kinds of sons and about their rights. For example, Gautama (probably the most ancient among extant sūtrakāras ) assigns the 10th place to the putrikāputra, while Baud., Kaut., Yaj, Bf. and Dovala give him the 2nd place and Vasiştha, Sankha-Likhita, Nār., and Vişnu put him 3rd. The dattaka, is placed very low in the list by most works except by Manu, Gaut., Baud., Bf. and Brahmapurāņa (which put him 3rd or 4th). The 12 kinds are put in two groups by some works. Gaut. ( 28. 30-31 ) provides that the aurasa, ksetraja, datta, kptrima, gūdhotpanna and apaviddha are rikthabhājah (take the wealth) and also belong to the gotra of the man whose sons they are, while the other six take only the gotra but not the wealth. Baud. Dh. 8. (II. 2. 36-37) employs the same words rikthabhājah and gotrabhājah but differs from Gaut. in including putrikāputra among'rikthabhājah' and omitting him from the group of 'gotrabhāja” .. 1233 Another division (each having six kinds ) is into bandhu-dāyāda or dāyādabāndhava (Manu IX. 158-159 and Nār, dāyabhāga 47) and adāyā dabāndhava (Manu IX. 160, Vas. 17. 38, Nār. dāyabhāga. 47). The first group, acc. to Manu, comprises aurasa ( also putrikā ), kşetraja, datta, kptrima, güdhotpanna and apaviddha. They are so called because they take the wealth of their father and also of his kinsmen (in the absence of nearer heirs ), while the members of the 2nd group (whick aco. to Manu IX. 160 comprises kānina,

sahodba, krita, paunarbhava, svayamdatta and saudra ) are only bāndbavas (1. e. belong to the gotra of their father), but cannot succeed to the wealth of their father's kinsmen. Here also there is no agreement among the emptis. Vas. (17. 5-25), Sankha-Likhita (g. in V. Rp. 247), Nār. dāyabhāga 47 and Hārita include in the first group aurasa, kşetraja, putrikāputra, paunarbhava, kānina and güdhaja and the rest in the 2nd group. Kaut. asserts that only the aurasa son succeeds as heir to the kingmen of his father while the others ( that are not procreated by him) succeed only to the father who brings them up, but not to his kinsmen. Yāj. II. 132 states that each of the twelve kinds mentioned by him takes the wealth of the father and offers pinda to him in default of the preceding one and further requires that this is so only if it is certain that the sons are of the same caste as that of the father. Gaut. 28, 32 states that 1234 the kānina and the other sons called gotrabhājaḥ (in 28. 31 ) take only one fourth of the estate of the father if no aurasa nor any of the other sons called rildhabhājah exists (and the rest of the estate is taken by the sapipdas ), while Kaut., Devala and Kat. ( 857 ) state that the dattaka, kşetraja and other kinds of sons are entitled to one third share only if an aurasa is born provided they are of the same varna and that if they are of a different caste, they are only entitled to food and raiment. If & man, having no son, made his daughter a putrikā or thinking himself to be impotent bad a kşetraja son or adopted a son and then an aurasa son was born, difficult questions of the dis tribution of his property arose on which there was no un. animity. Manu IX. 163 says that only the aurasa son is entitled to all the paternal wealth and all the other kinds should be given maintenance in order to avoid the fault of being cruel. But as regards the case where a putrika is first made and then an aurasa is born Manu (IX. 134 ) presoribes that these two should divide the paternal estate equally,1235 while

History of Dharmatastra 

(Vol. 

Manu IX. 164 asks the aurasa to give 1/5 or 1/6 of the paternal wealth to the kşetraja. This confusion and contradiction about the places and the shares of the several song leads one to infer that the institution of several kinds of sons was not very oommon or generally recognized, was rather confined to some localities or communities and was dying out even in the times of the ancient smrtis, if it ever existed in full force at all at any time. 

As regards gūdhaja, kānina and sahodha there is this to be said. They were the result of illicit connection ; but some one had to maintain them, to bring them up and be their guardian. The emptis when they assign these as the sons of tbe husbands of the women of whom they are born are really providing for these matters of maintenance and guardianship. Br. says that dattaka, apaviddha, krita, krta, and saudra, if of pure caste and pure actions, are middling, while the kşetraja, paunar bhava, kānlna, sahodha and gūdhaja are condemned hy the good (S. B. E. 33 p. 376 verses 40-41 ). 1236 The kanina was to be under the guardianship of the father of the girl ( Yāj. II. 129 ) till she remained unmarried, but when she married the damsel's Bon came under the dominion of the person who married her ( Manu IX. 172). The very fact that the kanina was assigned to the husband who married the girl shows that this was done because it was deemed that by marrying such a girl the husband condoned her past lapses. Similarly in the case of sahodha, it was deemed that either the child must have been procreated by the husband himself before marriage or that he condoned the conduct of the wife. It appears to have been thought that when the husband (the party most concerned) did not openly object it was not open or allowable for any one else even by proof that the child was kānina or sahodha to call

for the abandonment of the child. Similar remarks apply to the gūdhaja. As shown in H. of Dh. vol. II. pp. 571-573 if the wife was guilty of adultery the husband had certain powers of correction over the wife, but if he chose to be complaisant, then the smrtis did not compel him to disown or abandon the child. These very smstis (like Gautama, Vas., Nār.) that are very harsh on women for adultery allow the gūdhaja, kānina and sahodha to be secondary sons. So the only way in which these two attitudes can be reconciled is by holding that when the husband condones moral lapses on the part of the woman whom he had accepted as his wife the smộtis provide for the maintenance, guardianship and succession of such offspring of illicit connection. Even among medieval commentators there was divergence about paunarbhava, kanina, sahodha and güdhaja; Medhatithi on Manu IX, 181 holds that they are entitled to nothing but food and raiment in any case, while the Mit. (on Yāj. II. 132 ) holds that even the kanina and the rest take the father's wealth in default of aurasa and the other kinds of sons. The Mit. (on Yāj. I. 90) however holds that kānina, sahodha and güdhaja being the outcome of adultery cannot be savarna with the husband of their mother, are really different froin savarpa sons and even anuloma and pratiloma song. 

A good deal can be said about the spiritual benefit supposed to be derived from secondary song. 

The high eulogy bestowed on the son in the Vedic and smrti literature has reference only to the aurrisu son. Manu IX. 180 asserts that the eleven kinds of sons viz. kşetraja and the rest (except aurasa and putrikā) are merely substitutes for the real son, adınitted to prevent the cessation of religious rites and in IX. 181 Manu states the final conclusion that such sons as the kşetraja that are procreated from the seed of others really belong to him from whose seed they spring and not to the other man (who takes them up ). Br. 1237 (S B. E, 33 p. 375 verges 35-36) declares : 'thirteen sons were enumerated in

order by Manu, out of whom only the aurasa and putrikā are the cause of propagating the line. Just as oil is declared by the good to be a substitute (in sacrifices ) in the absence of clarified butter, so the eleven kinds of sons in the absence of aurasa and putrikā 1238 ( are admitted merely as substitutes and not the real thing ).' Although Yāj. II. 132 declares that each succeeding one out of the twelve kinds of sons takes the estate in the absence of each preceding one and offers pinga to the deceased owner, yet the efficacy of the piņdas offered by the several sons was deemed to differ very much. Manu leaves no room for doubt on this point when he says (IX, 161 ) 'a man desiring to cross beyond the gloom (of bad worlds, helle) through (or with the help of) bad sons (such as the kşetraja ) secures a result similar to what a person crossing (a sheet of ) water in a leaking boat secures'. The idea is that secondary sons cannot confer the same spiritual benefit as the aurasa son can. Modliātithi on Manu IX. 166 and the D. M. explain this very clearly. An aurasa son confers the highest spiritual benefit. The substitute sons (as indicated by the very use of the word Pratinidhi) confer a much less henefit. Even i man's widow can perform his sraddha if he be sonless, but as she could not offer the pārvuna śrüddha her act was not deemed to be as efficacious is a śrāddha performed by a son, 1239 Jaimini devotes several sütras to the subject of pratinidhi (a substitute in VI. 3. 13-41. The main conclusion established is that gene rally speaking there can be no substitute as regards the devatā (the deity to which a particular offering is directed by the Veda to be offered in a particular sacrifice ), the fire (ahavaniya and other consecrated fires), the mantra ( wbich is to accompany a particular offering) and certain rites specifically prescribed to be done in a sacrifice (such as 'samidho yajati' in Darsa pūrnamāsa ) and the svāmin (the sacrificer ).

3.35 Sabara makes 120 it clear that in employing a pratinidhi the yedio rite becomes deficient' and does not yield the full reward of the religious act. The Satyāşādha Śr. S. III. 1. asserts 1341 that there can be no substitute for the sacrificer, the wife, the son, the place, time &c. (prescribed by the Vedic texts for any rite). Therefore it is clear that there was difference of view among very ancient writers about the spiritual benefit to be derived from substitute sons. The natural human tendency to simplify matters and water down strict injunctions prevailed and it began to be thought that even subsidiary sons conferred gome spiritual benefit (though not as much as the aurasa son ). For about two thousand years the kşetraja and other sons have been prohibited by the smrtis. For example, Br. states that Manu first describes the procedure of niyoga and then forbids it, that it is impossible to practise niyoga in the dvāpara and kali ages owing to the deterioration in man's knowledge and tapas ( vide H. of Dh. vol. II. p. 603 n. 1418 for the quotation). The passage from Saunaka forbidding sons other than aurasa and dattaka in the Kali age quoted by Aparārka and others has been cited above ( n, 1131 ). 

A few remarks will be made on each of the several sons. 

Aurasa. Baud. Dh, S, II. 2. 14, Manu IX. 166, Vas. 17. 13. Vişnu Dh. S. 15. 2, Kaut. III, 7 and others define the aurasa as the son procreated by a man himself from his wife narried acc. to sacramental forms prescribed by the sāstra. Froin Āp. ( quoted above in n. 1227 ) and Baud, it follows that the aurasa is only the son procreated on a wife of the same varna as that of the husband; but this was the purists' view. Others including

such medieval works as the Mit. (on Yaj. II. 133 ), the Parijata and Apararka hold that even the son procreated on a wife married in the anuloma order 1242 (e. g. the son of a brābmana from a ksatriya wife or of a ksatriya from a vaisya caste wife ) was also aurasa. The exception was the son of a brāhinana from a šūdra wife, who was called saudra or pāratava and distinguished from the technical aurasa. Froni the definition of aurasa given by all smrti writers (and the dicta of such commentaries as the Mit.) it follows that in order to be an aurasa the procreation and the birth of the son must both be after the marriage. But the Privy Council held long ago in Pedda Amani v Zemindar of Marungpuri (1 I. A. 282, 293 ) that procreation after marriage is not distinctly necessary for legitimacy as a son even according to the ancient texts, that to hold 80 would be an inconvenient doctrine and that the Hindu Law is the same in that respect as the English Law. 1943 

From the times of the Rgveda people prayed for the birth of an aurasa son and did not like to adopt the son of another. A Rgvedio poet exclaims ( VII. 4. 7-8) 'As the wealth ( son )

The position of the Mit. is somewhat remarkable. The Mit, admits that niyoga is not allowed in the present Kali age (vide above p. 628 ) and it quotes a smrti text to that effect, but it allows the sons of anuloma marriages to be aurasa and to succeed before every other kinds of sons. Therefore it follows that the Mit. either did not know the passages of Saunaka and of the Nāradyiapurāna ( purvārdha 24. 13 ) which forbade marriage with asavarna girls for the twice-born classes in the Kali age or did not hold them to be authoritative.

1243. As this is a decision of the highest tribunal for British India it must be taken to be the law. The Privy Council was probably influenced by the description of such secondary sons as the saborha. The decision is in accordance with English Law and section 112 of the Indian Evidence Act. Vide Dr. Baanerjee's 'Marriage and stridhana' p. 177 for criticism of the P, C, decision.

Then he goes back to the same house (from which he came ); may & vigorous, victorious, newly born son come to us! "1244 

In modern times the courts generally recognize only two kinds of sons, viz. aurusa and datlaka, the other kinds of song being held to be long since obsolete. Vide Naginnas v. Bachoo 43 I. A. 56, 67. But two more kinds of sons have been recognized in modern times in certain provinces only, viz. the křtrima in Mithila (modern Tirhoot ) and the putrikāputra among the Nambudri brāhmaṇas of Malabar, both of which will be dealt with below. 

• Putrikāputra. The two meanings of this word given by the Mit. and others relying on Vas. have been stated above (p. 647 ): Kaut. III. 7, Yaj. II. 128, Manu IX. 134 declare the putrika or putrikāputra to be equal to the aurasa son. The conception underlying the putrikā has a hoary antiquity. There are traces of the putrika. in the Rgveda itself. Vas.124s XVII. 16 refers to 

1244. परिषरणस्प रेक्णो नित्पत्य रायः पतयः स्यामान शेषो अमे अन्यजात. मस्यचेतानस्य मा पथो विक्षः। न हि प्रभायारणा सुशेषोऽग्योदयों मनसा मन्तवा उ अधा चिदोकः पुनरिस एत्या मोवाज्यभाषाळेतु नग्यः R. VII, 4. 7-8. The verses are rather obscure, particularly the first one. The meaning given above is that of such an ancient writer as Yaska in Nir. III. 1-3. He says that these two verses support the view that the son belongs to the begetter (and not to the adopter): 'तयथा जनयितः प्रजा एवमर्थीये चावुवाहरिष्यामः । परिषचं.' Compare आप. ध.. II. 6. 13. 3 'उत्पादयितुः पुत्र इति हि बाहरणम् ।. The निर्णय सिन्धु says that the verse (न हि प्रभाय) does not really mean to prohibit the adoption of sons but is intended to extol the aurasa, as otherwise it would be opposed to the indications contained in the story of the acceptance of Sapagsepa as a son and to the words of the latter'may I become your son', योपिन हि प्रभाया ... मन्तवा उ इति श्रुतौ दत्तकनिषेधः सोप्यौरसातिशयार्थः, अन्यथा शुनाशेपादिमतिग्रहोलिकाविरोधापत्तेः । उपेयो तव पुत्रतामित्युक्तः । नि. सि.

Rg. I 124.7 in connection with putrikāi: That verse contains four similes in degoribing the advent of. Uşas ( Dawn)'As a woman that has no brother comes back to (her) male relations,... like a smiling damsel the Dawn unnasks objects (or her beauty). The Nirukta ( IIL 5 ) explains the first quarter as meaning that a brotherlegs maiden (after marriage ) comes back to ber paternal line for continuing that line and for offering pindas (to her paternal ancestors ) and does not go to her husband's Hne. The Rg. in several places refers to the difficulty of getting brotherless maidens married and to the fact of their remaining in their father's hous3 as old maidans; vida Rp. II. 17, m'amūjür. iur pitroh szcū sui' and IV. 5. 5. The Atharvaveda I. 17.1 states like brotherless sisters let these stand still with their splendours gone'. Yaska explains that, as brotherless maidens, when married, bar the way to the continuance of the family of their husbands and to offering of pindas (through their son), 80 are these red arteries &c. Vāska (Nirukta III. 4 ) relies for the appointment of a brotherless daughter as a son upon another very obscure verse of the Rg. (III. 31. 1 ) 1216 'the husband declares (or promises ) that the father may regard (the daughter's son) as his gon's son'. The Nirukta 1217 (III. 5) quotes a Vedic text one should not marry a brotherless (girl), for she becomes (her father's ) bon' and holds that it expressly prohibits marriage with a brotherless maiden and also declares that such a girl becomes a son to her father. The brotherless maiden is appointed as a son by express agreement, but accord. ing to Gautama 28. 17 the opinion of one school ( which he does not approve ) was that a brotherless girl became a putrika by the mere unilateral Intention of the father and therefore one should not marry a brotherless maiden for fear that the father (without expressly stipulating so) might intend her to be putrika. Manu III. 11 contains a similar caution. This re coinmendation not to marry a brotherless maiden continued down to the days of Yaj. (I. 53 'arogipim bhrātsmatim'), though in modern times many would prefer to marry such a girl, provided the father was well-off. Manu IX. 140 states that the

three piņas that the putrikāputra offered were respectively to his mother, to the mother's father and to the mother's paternal grand-father. 

The putrikāputra is no longer recognised anywhere in India except among the Namhudri brābmaņas of Malabar. Vide Thakoor Jeebnath v. Court of Wards 2 1. A. 163, 167, Babui Rila v. Babu Puran 1 Pat. L. J. 581, Kimaran v. Narayanan 9 Mad. 260, Chemnauth v. Palakuzhu 25 Mad. 662, 31 Mad.' 310. It appears that even a Madras authority like the Smrticandrikā 1248 was not aware of the prevalence of the putrikāputra in Malabar. 

Kşetraja. This kind of son arosa from the practice of niyoga. The origin of this practice and the limitations under which it was allowed have been dealt with at length in H. of Dh. vol. II. pp. 599-607. One matter not mentioned therein is this that the Brahmapurāņa states that kşetraja sons were very conimon among ksatriyas since they had no progeny either because they were cursed (by sages for their misdeeds ) or because they were constantly engaged in war. 1219 The Baud. Da. S. 11. 2. 21-23 and Kauţ. III. 7 declare the kşetraja to be the son of two fathers, to have two gotras and to offer pindas to both fathers (provided there is no aurasa son born subse quently ) and to take their wealth and that in offering each pinda they have to associate it with two names. 1250 It is to be noted that the Mit. on Yaj. II. 127 introduoes the kşetraja as dvyamuşyāyapa, although that word, as will be seen later on, has another signisicance algo. The Madanapārijata (p. 651) also regards kşetraja and dyyāmuşyāyaṇa as synonyms. The Vivadata.dava ( folio 122 ) states that the dvyāmuşyayapa and sons of intercaste marriages being forbidden in Kali it does not onter into any discussion about the rules of allotting shares to theni.

Kộtrima or kyta, as in Nār, dayabhāga 46). According to Manu IX, 169, Yaj. II. 131, Baud. Dh. S. II. 2. 25 and the Mit, and other works a křtrima is a person (of the same caste as the adopter) who has no parents and who is adopted with his own consent by the tempting offer of wealth. He is distinguished from the dattaka by the fact that he is not given by the father or mother and by the fact that his own consent is necessary ( 80 that he must be major according to the ancient Hindu Law). Such a son is recognized in modern times only in Mithila ( Tirhoot ) and the adjoining districts and among the Nambudri brahmaņas of Malabar (as held in Vasudevan v. Secretary of State 11 Mad. 157). Considerable case law exists about the kstrima adoption, for which Mulla's Hindu Law pp. 563-564 ( 9th ed.) and Mayne's Hindu law (10th ed.) pp. 293-294 may be consulted. 

Gudhaja. There is probably a reference to such a son in the Rg. II. 29. 1 1251 '01 Adityas, that uphold the moral law, that are always active, keep away from me sin as a woman giving birth to a child in secret (removes it)'. 

Kanina. This word is derived from the word 'kanya' (a maiden). Papini IV. 1. 116 (kanyāyāh kanina ca) derives the word in the sense of "child of a maiden" and the Kāsikā gives Karpa and Vyāsa as instances of kinina sons. The word kanina occurs in the Atharvaveda V. 5.8 and Kumāripura occurs in the Vājasaneyasamhita 30. 6. Nār. ( dāyabhāga 17 ) 1252 says that the kanina, sahodha and gūdhaja are the sons of the man who marries the mother of these and they take the wealth of the husband of their mother. The Pārijāta ( 9. by V. R. P. 565) states that the kanina and sahodha become the sons of their mother's father if the latter is sonless, but if he has a son thon they become the sons of the husband of their mother and if both have no sons then they become the sons of both.

DATTAKA ( adopted son) 

No branch of Hindu Law in modern times has been 80 fruitful in litigation' as adoption. There are instances, where, fifty years after a point in the law of adoption was deemed to have been settled by a Full Bench decision, the Privy Council intervened and overruled the Full Bench decision in spite of its usual practice to follow the rule of stare decisis. The medieval digests are full of varying interpretations of the same smrti toxts and the law of adoption differs from province to province according to the authoritative medieval works and modern case law. Voluminous works like those of Shastri Golapchandra Sarkar and of Mr. Kapur have been written on the subject of adoption in all its details. There is so much bewildering confusion and so much case law on the several aspects of adoption that it is only legislation that can resolve the tangled skein of the modern law of adoption. In this section an attempt will be made to present the law of adoption as evolved by the smrtis and medieval works and only some im portant cases bearing in various ways on the ancient law will be cited. 

It has been shown above (pp. 641,657) bow even in the times of the Rgveda the son of the body was eagerly sought for and how the adoption of another man's son was declared to be nut worthy of being thought of. Even so late an author as Sukra (11. 31 ) says that the adopted and other secondary sons should never be thought as one's sons, since on seeing a rich man they desire to be adopted 1252a. Yet Vedic Literature contains some references to adopted sons. In the Tai. S. VII. 1. 8. 1 we come across the the story of Atri, 12526 who gave an only son in adoption to Aurva in these words: 'Atri gave his son in adoption to Aurva

Ancient texts on adoption 

663 who desired to have a son. He (Atri), having become empty (as it were, by giving away his oply. son), thought himself to be destitute of strength, to be weak and worn out (lit. stale ). He (Atri) saw this catūrātra (a sacrifice of that same lasting for four days). He made preparations for it and performed that sacrifice. Then he had four valiant sons born to him, a good Hots, & good Udgats, a good Adhvaryu and a good sabheya (skilful speaker in an assembly). The story of Sunabšepa in the Ait. Br. (33) shows that Viśvāmitra, though he had already one hundred and one 'Bons, adopted Sunaksepa under the name Davarata, with the consent of his fifty-one sons (with Madhu cchandas 1253 at their head), though the elder 50 sons disobeyed their father. It must be supposed that the later rule allowing only a sonless man to adopt did not apply to Viśvāmitra. 

The sūtras and smstis contain hardly anything about the dattaka except his name (among the 12 kinds of sons) or the definition, as in Baud, Dh. S. II. 2. 24, Manu IX. 168, Yāj. II. 130, Vişnu Dh. S 15. 18-19, Nār. (dāyabhaga 46). The Vas. Dh. 8. is an excoption. It not only gives a definition (in 17. 28-29), but is one of the earliest smrti texts to dilate on the rules about adoption (in 15.1-9). What it says may ba sat for th in one place. "Man produced from seed and blood owes his birth to his mother and father. (Hence) the mother and father have power to give, to sell or to abandon him. But one should not give or accept an only son, for, he is required to continue the line of his ancestors. A woman should neither give nor receive a son (in adoption) except with the permission of her husband. One about to take a son in adoption should, after having inyl ted his kinsaien, having informed the ruler (of the intended adoption) and having performed in the middle part of his house a homa with the výāhstis, take only him who is closely related and who is a kinsman not remote (in habitation and speech ). If a doubt ariges ( as to the family of the person to be adopted) he (the person desiring to adopt) should treat one whose kinsmen are in a remote place as if he were a sūdra; for it is declared (in the Brakmana or Vedio works) by means of one. (son, auraga or adopted) he (the adopter) saves many'. If, after a son is taken (in adoption ), an aurasa is born (to the adopter)the adopted son shall be the recipient of a fourth

the Privy Council as of the highest authority in matters of adoption. In Collector of Madura v. Mootoo 12 Moo. I. A. 397 at p. 437 the P. C. obserye: 'Of the Dattakamsmāmsā of Nanda Pandita and the Dattaka. Candrikā of Devanna Bhatta, two treatises on the particular subject of adoption, Sir William Macnaghton says that they are respected all over India; but that when they differ the doctrine of the latter is adhered to in Bengal and by the southern Jurists, while the former is said to be the infallible guide in the provinces of Mithila and Benares'. But Jolly (T. L. L. p. 166) gives a far more correct estimate of the value of the D. M. when he says 'It is simply a mis fortune that so much authority should have been attributed in the courts all over India to such a treatise as Nanda Pandita's Mimāṁsā which abounds more in fanciful distinctions than perhaps any other work on adoption and it is high time that the numerous other treatises on adoption should be thoroughly examined and given their due weight. In Bhagwan v. Bhagwan 26 I A. 153 at p. 161 the P. C. observe 'To call it (the Dattaka mimāṁga ) infallible is too strong an expression and the esti mates of Sutherland and of West and Bühler seem nearer the true mark; but it is clear that both works must be accepted as bearing high authority for so long a time that they have be come embedded in the general law'. Yet even these works have been set at naught and departed from by Courts in India on many points as will appear in the sequel. 

The principal matters to be discussed under adoption are : object of adoption, persons that may legally take in adoption, persons that may give in adoption, persons that may be taken in adoption, the requisites and ceremonies of adoption and the results of adoption. 

The objects of adoption-Atri (verse 52 ) quoted above in note 1231 declares that that man alone who has no son should always secure a substitute for a son with all possible effort for the sake of securing the offering of pindas (funeral and śrāddha cakes) and water. The D. C. quotes this verse and also an other ascribed by it to Manu 1257 in which the object of adoption is said to be twofold, viz. securing spiritual benefit from the piņdas and water ( offered by him ) and perpetuating the name and family of the adopter. In one of the latest cases on adop.

tion that revolutionized the law the Privy Council 1258 emphasize the peculiar religious significance that has attached to the son among all classes of Hindus, refer to the 9th chapter of Manu verses 106, 107, 137, 138 of which are instinct with this doctrine, hold that the foundation of the Brabminical doctrine of adop tion is the duty which every Hindu owes to his ancestors to provide for the continuance of the line and the solemnization of the necessary rites and that in this doctrine the devolution of property, though recognized as the inherent right of the son, is altogether a secondary consideration. 

Persons who can gine in adoption--The primary right to give in adoption is that of the father, who can do so without consult ing the mother, 1259 The mother cannot without the husband's permission give her son in adoption while the father is alive and capable of consenting. But the mother alone can (as said by Manu IX. 168, Yaj. II. 130 ) give her son in adoption if the father be dead or if he is incapable of giving consent or has entered the order of ascetics, provided he has not expressly or impliedly prohibited her to do 80. If both parents are dead no one else, not even the paternal grand-father or the step-mother or a brother, can give a man in adoption. If A has a son B and is then given in adoption by his mother into another family, it was held in Martand v. Narayan that A still retained his power as father to give away B in adoption (1. L. R. 1939 Bom, 586 F.B.). This decision has been dissented from by the Nagpur High Court in Sharadachandra v. Shantabai (I. L. R. 1944 Nag. p. 544, F. B.). But the reasons given by the Nagpur High Court are not convincing and the judges seem to be influenced by the dictum of the P. O. that the adopted son is 

1258. Vide Amarendra Man Singh v. Sanatan 60 I. A. p. 242. Though it may be conceded that in the majority of cases the object of the adopter is religious, the object of the giver and of the person adopted (if he is grown up) is far from religious. The main object of the latter two at least in modern times is to secure wealth without effort and hardly any reli. gious motives enter into their minds. No ono gives a son in adoption to a poor man, though a poor man has a soul to save as much as a rich man. Besides in adoption by widows, their motive is very often far from religious. They often adopt out of pique against their husband's brothers or nephews Bad for benefiting themselves monetarily by making agreements with the adopted sons to share the property with them.

Who may adopt a son

just like an aurasa son except in a few well defined cases. It cannot be supposed that the P. O. know all the texts of the nibandhas dealing with adoption. Though the Bombay High Court held in Putalabai v. Mahadu 33 Bom. 107 that a mother did not by her remarriage forfeit her right to give in adoption her son by the first husband, that decision was subsequently overruled in Fakirappa v. Savitreua 23 Bom, L. R. 482 (F. B.) which decided that after remarriage a widow has no power to give in adoption her son by the first husband. The same High Court held in Shamsing v. Shantabai (25 Bom. 551) that a Hindu father, who, after the birth of a bon, became a convert to the Moslem faith, did not by reason of his conversion lose his power of giving his son, who remained a Hindu, in adoption though the physical act of giving in adoption, being accom panied by religious ceremonies, may have to be delegated by him to a Hindu. This decision was based on the Caste Dis abilities Removal Act of 1851 (for which see above p. 547, no 1021 ). This decision is against the spirit of the ancient Hindu Law. 

What persons may adopt a son. Every male Hindu, who is of sound mind and has attained the age of discretion though he may be a minor according to the Indian Majority Act (III of 1875), can take a son in adoption provided he has no son, grandson or great-grandson, natural or adopted, living at the time of adoption. The word 'aputrena' in the verse of Atri ( quoted above in n. 1231) is explained by the D. M. as meaning 1260 one who had no son at all or whose son is dead and as in cluding the grandson and great-grandson. It would appear from a Bombay decision that even if a Hindu has a son, grand son or great-grandson disqualified from inheriting on the grounds mentioned above he cannot adopt (vide Bharmappa v. Ujjangauda 46 Bom. 455). In the Dattasiddhantamañjarl of Balakrspa (folio 11b) it is stated that if the aurasa son of a person is congenitally blind, dumb or deaf he can take a boy in adoption. In Krishnaji v. Raghavendra I. L. R. (1942) Bom. 492 it has been held, relying upon 46 Bom, 455, that a widow

cannot adopt a son during the lifetime of her natural son who was a congenital idiot. The fact that a man is a bachelor or a widower or that his wife does not consent or that she is preg nant at the time of adoption does not prevent him from taking a son in adoption. In fact Vasiştha provides for the birth of a son after a son is adopted (15. 9). It was said 1261 by Rudra. dhara aud Vacaspati that as gūdras cannot perform homa with vedic mantras ( required by Vas. quoted above on p. 663) sūdras cannot adopt a son. Others like Raghunandana, Nilakantha, D.M. hold that a gūdra can adopt, as Saunaka expressly allows him to do so and that the homa may be performed through & brāh maņa (as allowed by Parāśara VI. 63-64) 1262. A wife cannot adopt during her husband's lifetime except with his express congent (as Vas. 15. 5 says). 

After a man's death the only person that can adopt to him is his widow. It is as regards the power of the widow that the greatest divergence of views prevails. The basic text is that of Vas. 15. 5 (a woman should not give or take in adoption except with the absent of her husband). The resourcefulness and ingenuity of commentators, all deemed to be orthodox and all proficient in the Mimāṁsā rules of interpretation, is illustrated nowhere better than in the interpretations of this text. Four interpretations are placed on this sūtra of Vasiştha: (1) The D. M. and writers of Mithilā such as Vācaspati hold that a widow cannot adopt at all, because at the time of adoption it is im possible to have the consent of the husband (who is then dead) and because a woman cannot perform the homa with vedic mantras and cannot repeat the vedic passages about acceptance (which are required by Vasistha and Saunaka); (2) In Bengal, Madras and Benares it is held that a widow may adopt under an authority from her husband given during his lifetime.

idea is that the permission (anujñāna) of the husband is not required to be given just at the time of the adoption and that it may be given long before the actual adoption. (3) In Madras a widow may also adopt without 1263 her husband's authority, provided she secures the consent of the father-in-law or (if the latter be dead) of all the co-parceners of the husband, if her husband died as a member of a joint family, and if the husband was separate at the time of his death, then the consent of the father-in-law or (if he were dead) of a substantial majo rity of her husband's nearest sapindas. In this view the word 'of the husband' (in Vasistha) is taken as only illustrative and not literally, (4) The Vyayahāramayükha, 1264 the Nirnaya sindhu, the Samskārakaustubha, the Dharmasindhu, that are regarded as authoritative in Bombay and Western India, hold that the passage of Vasistha refers only to a wife whose husband is alive and that a widow may adopt without the husband's autho rity. According to this school the husband's authority to adopt is always to be presumed, unless he has prohibited his widow expressly or by necessary implication from adopting. The D. C. appeals to the general maxim 'another's (or the opponent's) view if not dissented from may be taken as having been approved'. 

1263. In Balsubramanya v. M. Subbayya L. R 65 I. A. 93 at p. 99 the Privy Council say : 'their Lordships are not laying down that the requisite authority must necessarily be express but they agree with the District Judge that in order to constitute an implied authority there must be circumstantial evidence of a cogent character'. Vide The Collector of Madura v. Mootoo 12 Moo. I. A. 397 pp. 435-36 where three of these four interpretations are pointed out.

History of Dharmasastra 

(Voi. 

There is a large volume of case law about the construction of the authority to adopt, about the rights of co-widows in the matter of adoption, about the limits of a widow's power, which are deemed to be outside the purview of this work. 

As regards the power of a widow to adopt in the Bombay school, when her husband was joint at the time of his death, the case law has fluctuated from time to time. Only a few cases may be referred to here. In Ramji v. Ghamau 6 Bom, 498 (F. B.) a Full Bench of the Bombay High Court held tbat a widow, whose husband was a member of a joint family at the time of his death, could not adopt when she has not the authority of her husband or the consent of the husband's un divided coparceners. After this decision had stood for 50 years the Privy Council held in Bhimabai v. Gurunathgouda 1265 L. R. 60 I. A. P. 25 that the Full Bench decision had already been overruled in Yadao . Namdeo ( 48 I. A. 513) and that a Hindu widow can adopt without the consent of her husband's 

1265. IA Bbimabai's case the Privy Council purport to follow the case of Rakhmabai v, Radhabai 5 Bom. H. C. R. (A C. J.) p 181. But in that case the husband was separate at tbe time of his death. The P. C. however point out that in Yadao v, Namdeo (48 1. A. 513 at p. 529 ) it was said that the decision ia Rakhmabai's case was not based on the fact that the husband was separate at bis death or on the fact that the widow when she made the adoption bad the estate vested in her and it was beld tbat that decision was equally applicable wbere the husband was joint. Apart from the fact that the decision of the P. C. is opposed to the general sentiment of Hindu society at present, with the greatest respect two criticisms have to be offered against the decision in Bhimabai's case. The passage of the Vyavabāramayūkba relied upon in Rakhmabai's case and in Bbimabal's case has not been correctly understood, The Mayökha was combating the view of others that a widow cannot adopt at all. Therefore ho tried to establish that a widow can adopt without her husband's authority. But the Mayukha did not say expressly that she can adopt without any body's authority or that she can adopt even in a joint family without the consent of the coparceners or even against their wishes. On the contrary if we look at the whole context where he quotes Vāj. I. 85 and a verse of Kāt. (930) it would appear that he meant to convey that the consent of the father of the husband or of his kiasmen would be necessary. Further, no one drew the attention of the P. C. to another passage of the V, Mayūkba whore it summarizes the rite of adoption and states 'Women whose busbands are alive are entitled to adopt with the permission of their husbands: failing the husband, a woman can adopt with the permission of the (busband's) father and the rest: front FUIT HIHAT THE faming , HYU P. 120.

Widow's power to adopt 

671 

00-parooners, when the husband was a member of a joint family at the time of his death. This decision was carried further by Amarendra's case ( 60 L. A. 242 ) by holding that when a widow, who had authority to adopt, adopted even after the estate had devolved on a male collateral heir such adopted son would take the estate and deprive the heir of it. As any widow was held to be able to adopt in Bombay without anybody's consent, hundreds of adoptions have taken place, which came and are coming before the courts. Another Full Bench case held that when a Hindu coparconary came to an end on the death of the last surviving coparcener and the family property became Vested in his heir, a subsequent adoption by the widow of a predeceased coparcener was valid, but it did not revive the coparcenary nor did it vest the property of the former co parcenary in the adopted son (Balu v. Lahoo L L. R. 1937 Bom. 508). When a co-parcenary was broken up by partition among the members, it was held 1266 that the widow of a co parcener who died long before the partition cannot make a valid adoption and reliance was placed on a passage of the Viramitrodaya ( quoted below ). 1207 

But these decisions have been dissented from in Bajirao v. Ramkrishna I. L. R. (1941) Nagpur 707 and in K. R. Sankarlingam Pillai v. Veluchami Pillai I. L. R. (1943) Mad, 309 ( F. B.), where it has been laid down that when the surviving coparconers of a joint Hindu family were in possession of the joint family properties which they obtained in a partition among themselves after the death of a coparcener and subsequent to the partition a valid adoption was made to the deceased coparcener by his widow the adopted son was entitled to reopen the partition. They rely by way of analogy on the provisions of Yaj. that the posthumous son can reopen a partition already made and also on that of the disqualified heir when the disqualification is removed and on the dicta in some cases that an adoption dates back to the date of the death of the adoptive father, But no smrti text and no digest has extended the exceptional rules about the posthumous son and the disqualified heir to a son

adopted after partition. Their reasoning as regards the Bombay cases is not satisfaotory. It amounts to this that as between the separating co-paroeners the coparcenary may be extinct but as to the subsequently adopted son it exists i. e, a co parcenary is extinct and existing at the same time, which, to use no stronger expression, appears rather strange. Besides the general rule is that partition is made only once ( Manu 1X. 47). The cases of the posthumous son and of the disqualified heir are expressly provided by way of exceptions. The usual rule is that exceptions are to be strictly limited to the matters expressly stated and are not to be extended by analogy to cases not covered by the words of the exception and that other cases are governed by the general rule. It is a canon of interpreta tion in Hindu Law that a special text forming an exception to a general text should be construed strictly and applied only to the cases clearly falling within it ( Gangi v. Chandrabhagabai 32 Bom. 275, 283, Hanmant v. Ganesh 43 Bom. 612, 624). Further, a Hindu widow is not compelled to adopt at any particular time; she may adopt at any time during her life. In Raje Vyankatrao v. Jayavantrao 4 Bom. H. C. R. (A, C. J.) 191 it is noticed that the widow in that case adopted 71 years after her husband's death. If the reasoning of the learned Judges of Nagpur and Madras is correct then when three or four genera tions have succeeded to the separating coparceners, an adopted' son can reopen the partition after three quarters of a century This result, to say the least, would be most unreasonable. The Nagpur High Court observes that every Hindu widow is a potential mother. This is a fiction which has been oarried too far by that courtand by the Privy Council. A woman in the order of nature can hardly ever have an aurasa son beyond the age of fifty or so, but when a fiction is employed a woman can bring into existence & son even when she is 80 or 90. The Privy Council have approved of the Nagpur and Madras decisions recently in Anant v. Shankar 46 Bom. L. R. 1. They hold that a Hindu family cannot be brought to an end while it is possible in nature or law to add a male member to it or while there is still a potential mother if that mother in the way of nature or law brings in a new member. In Ramchandra v. Shankar 47 Bom. L. R. 121 (F. B.) the Privy Council decision in Anant v. Shankar has been followed and it is held that, the decision in Balu v. Lahod has been expressly overruled by the Privy Counoil. The consequences of these latest decisions will be inost disastrous for Hindus. In Amarondra's case the P, O. state that there

must be some limit to the power of a widow to adopt or some conditions in which it would be contrary to the spirit of the dootrine to admit its continuance or inequitable in the face of other rights to allow it to take effect (L. R. 60 I. A. 242 at p. 249 ). ' In Madana Mohana v. Purshothama L. R. 45 I. A. 156 the P. O. approving of Ramkrishna v. Shamrao - 26 Bom. 526 (F. B.) held that, when a man dies leaving a widow and a son and that son dies leaving his own son or a widow to continue the line by adoption, the power of the former widow comes to an end and cannot be revived; that is, they were prepared to hold that the grandmother succeed ing to her grandson who died unmarried could not make a valid adoption and allowed the grandfather and his ancestors to remain without the religious benefits that a son adopted by the grandmother would have conferred (in spite of the 9th chapter of Manu on which they rely in Amarendra's case ). According to the recent rulings any widow whose husband died a member of a joint Hindu family may adopt at any time oven when the other members become separate and may remain separate for 50 years or more and yet a large slice of the estate may be taken away after several generations have succeeded, laboured and acquired a vast estate. Further, it is not clear how far the P. O. will go in their solioitude for the adopted son. Suppose three brothers separate and one of them sells the pro perty that came to his share. If the partition is to be opened for the benefit of a son subsequently adopted by a predeceased member's widow, will the purchaser be affected or not (supposing the sale is within 12 years of the adoption)? Suppoging that the last surviving member of a fainily dies leaving a married daughter and a predeceased son's widow and the daughter inhe rits an absolute estate ( as she does in Bombay) and remains in possession for 30 years, is it meant that a son thereafter adopted by the widowed daughter-in-law can divest an estate Vested for thirty years in a married daughter who is not a mem ber of the family at all after her marriage? The recent P. C. decision in Anant v. Shankar appears to indicate that whatever the longth of time the adopted son will oust a collateral to whom the estate may have gone by inheritance. Intending purchasers have become afraid that there is no knowing how far the P. O. may go. These decisions will lead on to hurried sales of joint family proporty at whatever price may be fetched immodiately a coparcener dies leaving a widow. The result of the several decisions of the P. O. has been that properties of

Hindu families in which widows of predeceased coparceners exist are not easily saleable and do not yield their proper market value. The inroads on the ancient joint family system of the Mitakşarā have been so many that only the shell remains; the burdeng are there, but the soul is gone, what with the right of each coparcener to alienate his share for consideration, the Gains of learning Act, Act 18 of 1937, the decisions of the P. C. about adoption, sec. 39 of the Transfer of Property Act. It would be better if the Legislature declared that the joint family system of the Mitakşarā type has been abrogated, if all the inno vations introduced by legislation and judicial decisions are to be kept intact. 

A widow who has attained years of discretion may adopt although she is a minor according to the Indian Majority Act (of 1875). It has been held in Bengal that an unchaste 1368 widow cannot adopt, but in the Bombay Presidency it has been held that a sūdra widow, though unchasto, may make a valid adoption, 1369 If a man dies leaving a widow D and two sons A and B, who form a joint Hindu family, and subsequently A dies leaving a widow C and his brother B, and if B dies un married and the mother D suoceeds as heir to her unmarried Bon B, she has still the power to adopt a son. The duty of continuing the line was cast upon both A and B and not on A alone and therefore when A dies that duty is cast on the survi ving coparcener B. Therefore the proposition laid down in Ramkrishna v. Shamrao cannot apply and the mother of B can adopt ( vide Anant ». Dnyaneshwar 46 Bom. L. R. 353 ). 

Who may be adopted. The person to be adopted must be a malo according to the Vyavahāramayūkha1270 which relies on the analogy of upanayana ( that only a male undergoes, as stated in the ancient text 'aztavarpam brāhmanam-upanayita). This has been followed by

the Indian Courts. 171 But the D. M, (pp. 112-116 ), Sam. K. (p. 188 ) and Dharmasindhu 1972 relying upon such instances as that of Santa, the daughter of king Dasaratha ( who was adopted by king Lomapāda) and of Pșthā, who was the daughter of Sūra and was adopted by Kuntibhoja, say that even a girl may be adopted. Pannalal in ‘Kumaun local customs' states that a girl may be adopted as a daughter in Kumaun by custom. The person to be adopted must be of the same caste as the adopting father. Yaj. II. 133, providing that the twelve kinds of sons that offer the pinda and take the wealth one after another in order, applies only to sons of the same caste. Saunaka also requires sameness of caste. Manu IX. 168 employs the word 'sadrśam', which was interpreted by Medbā. tithi as meaning 'similar to the adopter in qualities and not in caste'. Medhātithi 1273 expressly states that a brahmana may adopt a kşatriya boy. But Kullūka and the other con mentators of Manu, the V. Mayūkha and other works hold that the boy must be of the same caste. The Sam. K, p. 150 and Dharmasindhu go a step further by saying that even a brāhmaṇa should adopt another of the same country. The Vāyu purāņa (99. 137–139) narrates that Bharata, son of Duşyanta, adopted Bharadvāja, son of Bphaspati and a brahmana, who then became a kşatriya. 1274 The courts accept the view of Kullūka and the rest. It is likely that courts may allow & boy from & subcaste of each of the four principal varpas to be adopted by a man belonging to another subcaste of the same varpa, 1274.

that the dattaka may be of a different caste, but that such a son will not take the wealth. 1275 In spite of the words of Vas. 15. 3 and of Saunaka ( that one having an only son should not give him ) the courts have hold that even an only son may be given or taken in adoption and that the words of Vasiştha are merely recominendatory. Vide Sri Balusu Gurulingaswami v. Sri Balusu Ramalakshmamma 26 I. A. p. 113 and Vyas Chimanlal v. Vyas Ramchandra 24 Bom, 367 ( F. B.). In connec tion with the force of the words of Vas. 15, 3-4 stating why an only son should not be given or taken, Jaimini's rule contained in what is called the 'hetuvan-nigadadhikarana '1276 (Jai. I. .. 26-30) came in for very exhaustive discussion in Beni Prasad v. Hardai Bibi 14 All. 67 (F. B.) and Radha Mohun v. Hardai Bibi 26 I. A. pp. 113, 146. There are several Vedic passages like this,' he offers the grains into the fire with a windowing basket, for food is prepared with the help of it' (Tai. Br. I 6.5). The question is whether such sentences put forward a reason for what is enjoined in the preceding portion or whether they are intended merely as arthavādas (i. e. for the praise of what is stated in the preceding part of the passage ). Jaimini con cludes that they are for the purpose of praise 1277 alone.

Adoption of eldest son 

677 

"The eldest son also should not be taken in adoption, since, as the Mit. (on Yāj. IL 130) puts it, it is the eldest son alone who is the foremost in serving the purposes of a son as regards his genetive father aco, to Manu IX. 106 which says 'a man becomes one having & son (a father) by the mere faot of the birth of his ( fret) son and becomes free from the debt owed to 

(Continued from the last page) prepared) may equally be used instead of the sūrpa. But the object of the latter half is not to assign a reason, but rather to praise and recommend tho sūrpa as the means of making the homa and so nothing but the sūrpa can be employed in making the offering. The Veda is the final authority in all matters pertaining to sacrifice; it does not stand in need of giving reasons for its prescriptions but it may eulogise an act to induce people to perform it. Therefore in the hetuvan-nigadādbikarana Jaimini does not lay down (as thought by Mandlik and by the High Court in 14 All, 67, pp. 73, 84, 125) that when a text is supported by a clause containing words of reason, it should be regarded as merely recommendatory (and not obligatory), but what Jaimidi lays down is that clauses containing words generally meaning *reason' are to be construed as arthavadas (praises) of the obligatory rule contained in a previous clause. Mr. Mandlik says (p. 499 of bis . Hindu Law'). It is a rule of the Pūrvamimamsā that all texts supported by the Assigning of a reason are to be deemed not as vidhi but simply as arthavada (recommendatory). When a text is treated as an arthavāda it follows that it has no obligatory force whatever. Sabarasvamia constructs an adhi karaña on this head which he calls 'hetuman-nigadādhikarana' (quoted in 14 All. 67 at p. 73). This is entirely wrong as shown above and the adhi karana is not called 'hetuman etc.' but 'hetuvan etc.'. Acc. to Jaimini's rule the words of Vas. 15.3 'naikam putram' contain a vidbi (an obligatory rule), while the following clause containing the word 'hi' (indicative of a reason) 'sa hi santānāya pūrvesām'is merely an arthavada, which praises the vidbi by emphasizing the importance of a son. Sarkar in his 'Mimāmsā Rules' (pp. 175-176) correctly represents the meaning of Jaimini, though in somewhat obscure language, The decisions in 14 All. 67 and 26 I. A. 113 are correct so far as the Mit. and the Mayükba are concerned, though the judgments in the former case are wrong in what is regarded to be the meaning of Jaimini's aphorisms constituting 'betuvan-pigadādhikarana'. The Privy Council in 26 I. A, 113 at p. 146 refer to the supposed rule of Jaimini that all precepta supported by the assignment of a reason are to be taken as recommendations only, but they express themselves guardedly and say that the rule is rather startling and they would not admit it to be true unless tbey made' an intimate study of the smộtis. The commentaries will make the Pūrvamināmsā position clear.

the pitre'. But in modern times this rule is taken to be only roommendatory and the adoption of the eldest son is held valid as also that of an only son 1978. The V. Mayükha (p. 108) states: 800, to the Mit. the prohibition to give the eldest son affects only the giver but not the adopter and he criticizes the Mit. that Manu LX. 106 does not forbid the giving of the eldest son, but only provides that by the birth of the first son a man becomes free from debt (to pitrs). So the V. Mayākha goes a step fur ther and holds that there is no prohibition at all either to give.. or take in adoption the eldest son, while the Mit., though it does not hold the adoption bad, seems to hold that the giver incurred blame. The Sam. K. p. 150 also does not allow the adoption of the eldest son. Two or more persons cannot adopt the same boy and if they do so the adoption by each is invalid 1779. The Dvyāmuşyayaņa adoption, to be described later on, is an exception. 

The texts contain rules about preference in selecting a boy for adoption, when several are eligible. The Mit, 1280 on Yaj. II. 132 declares that the verse of Manu IX, 182 stating that when out of several brothers who are sons of the same father one has a son all of them become through that son per sons having a son' does not provide that he becomes really the son of all but it indicates that when a brother's son is available

for adoption another boy should not be adopted. A similar explanation had been given by an ancient commentator Deva. svĀmin. The D. M., D. C. (pp. 5-6 ) and Sam. K. p. 150 quote passages of Saunaka 1981 and Sakala that a man should prefer a sapiņda or a sagotra to one who is not a sapiņda or of the same gotra. The D. M., D. C., the Sam. K. p. 150, the Dharma sindhu recommend the following order: the full brother's son, then a sagotra sapinda, then a sapinda though not of the same gotra (such as a boy from one's maternal uncle's line or a paternal aunt's descendant), then one not a sapiņda though of the same gotra, then one who is neither a sapiņda nor a sagotra. This order is purely recommendatory and an adoption in breach of it is quite valid. It has been recently held that an adoption is invalid if the boy adopted be congenitally and incurably deaf and dumb though not an idiot. Vide Surendra v. Bholanath I. L. R. (1944) 1 Ca). 139. 

As to the age of the boy to be adopted there is great diver gence among the medieval writers which is also reflected in the case law. In this connection certain verses of the Kālikāpuriņa assume 1282 great importance. The V. Mayūkha and the D. C.

hold that the passage is of doubtful authenticity (as the verses are not found in several mss.), while the D. M. and the Nirnaya sindhu hold them to be genuine and the Sam. K. pp. ( 169-172) after referring to these views states that those verses are opposed to what is stated in the Ait. Br. about Sunaḥsepa who was adopted by Visvāmitra as a son even after upanayana. The Verges are: 'O King1 that son, whose samskāras up to (including) the cuda (tonsure ) ceremony are performed with the gotra of his (natural) father, does not (i. e, cannot) attain the status of the adopted son of another. When the ceremonies of cûda and upanayana are performed under his own gotra (by the adoptive father) the dattaka and the other kinds become (recognised as) sons (in the adoptive family); otherwise they are called dāsa (slave). After the fifth year the adopted son and the rest can not be (recognised as) sons. Having taken one who is five years old, one ( the adopter ) should first perform the putreşti'. These verges state four propositions: (1) If all samskāras from jātakarma to cüda (ie, including it) have been performed in the family of birth that boy cannot be adopted in another family; (2) if a boy's cüdā and other later ceremonies are per formed in the family of adoption he is fully an adopted son; (3) a boy over five years of age cannot be adopted at all; (4) a boy whose cüda has been performed in the family of birth may be adopted up to five years, provided the rite called putreşti 1283 is first performed in the adoptive family before any other cere. mony is performed on the adopted boy. The D. M. says that the best time for adoption is up to three years, then from three years to five is the next best (gauna) and that after five no boy can be adopted. The D. O. (p. 36 ) holds that a boy of the three higher classes can be adopted up to upanayana and that a šūdra boy can be adopted till his marriage. The Nirnaya sindhu seems to be of the same opinion. The V.

and Sam. K. both hold that even a boy not of the same gotra may be taken in adoption after upanayana or after marriage and even when the person to be adopted has himself had a son. In Bengal, Benares 1285. and Bihar the courts hold that the boy must be adopted before upanayana. The same rule holds good in Madras 1286 ; but there it is further held that if the boy to be adopted is of the same gotra as the adopter, the adoption may be made after upanayana but before marriage. In Bombay a person may be adopted at any age, even after marriage and even after he has had children and he may be even older than the adopter. 1387 In the whole of India, a šūdra may be adopted only before his marriage, but in the Bombay Presidency the adoption of a married man and of one having even a child is allowed also among gūdras 1288

History of Dharmasastra 

(Vol. Saunaka required that the boy to be adopted must be pritracchayavaha 1289 (one who bears resemblance to or is a reflec tion of the aurasa son). This has led to differing explanations by the commentators and contradictory decisions in the several Indian High Courts. The D. M. and D. C. (p. 21 ) both explain that the resemblance consists in the possibility of being pro created by the adopter himself by niyoga and the like. The meaning of the D. M. is: A brother's son or a sapinda's son or a sagotra's son can be adopted because the adopter could have procreated a son by the practice of niyoga on the wife of a brother or a sapiņda or a sagotra (according to the rules of niyoga); but he could not have done so as regards his mother, or grandmother, daughter or sister or his mother's sister. There fore a man cannot adopt his own brother, paternal or maternal uncle, a daughter's son or a sister's son and the like. One strange thing is that, though niyoga had been forbidden for many centuries before the D. M., the author of it brings in the rules of the long obsoleto practice of niyoga 1290 to find out who could or could not be adopted. But stranger things were to happen. Sutherland who translated both the D.M. and the D. C. explained in his notes the word ' niyogādina' as ' by such an appointment or marriage and the like'. Vide Stoke's Hindu Law Texts p. 590 ( Dattakamlmāṁsa, sec. V, placitum 16 note). There was no warrant for introducing the word ' marriage' after 'niyoga'. The rules of niyoga are different from those of marriage. The judges most of whom were generally ignorant of Sanskrit and had yet to decide cases among Hindus according to Hindu Law as understood by them ( vide 26 I. A. 113 at page 128 about the ignorance of Sanskrit among judges ) seized upon this explana tion and evolved the curious rule that no one could be adopted whose mother the adopter could not have married in her maiden state (i. e. the relationship has reference to a time prior to

marriage ). This is still the law in all Presidencies 1291 except Bombay. Although the D. M. stated that the boy to be adopted must be capable of being prooreated by niyoga, at another place it remarks, after quoting verses of Saunaka 1992 and Sakala, that a boy of another gotra may be adopted except a daughter's son, a sister's son and a mother's sister's son. The Bombay High Court holds that any one may be adopted except these three (vide Rantchandra v. Gopal 32 Bom. 619, Walbai v. Heerbai 34 Bom. 491 holding that a man cannot adopt his mother's sister's son, Ramkrishna v. Chimnaji 15 Bom. L. R. 824 holding the adoption of father's sister's son valid). Very strange results have followed from this viz. the Bombay High Court has upheld the validity of the adoption as a son by a man of his own half-brother ( vide Gajanan v. Kashinath 39 Bom. 410), of his own maternal uncle's son, and the adoption by a widow of her deceased husband's son-in-law ( vide Sitabai v. Parvatibai 47 Bom. 35 ). It should be noted that the Dvaitanirnaya or Dharmadvaitanir naya 1293 (of Sankarabhatta, father of Nilakantha) and the V. Mayükha both hold after a very abstruse reasoning based on several Mimāmsā rules, that men of the three higher classes may

adopt a daughter's son, a sisters's son or a mother's sister's son and that a südra must adopt one of these if available in preference to any one else. The Bombay High Court follows the inter pretation of Saunaka's verse given by Nandapandita in preference to Nilakantha's, but in its turn disregards the authority of Nandapaņdita who forbade the adoption of a brother or uncle. It would have been far better if it had generally brushed aside everywhere the dicta of Nanda pandita and preferred the interpretation of the Mayūkha. Popular sentiment is in favour of the daughter's son or sister's son being adopted, as they are the nearest and often the dearest relations, and yet the High Court shuts the door against them, while it opens it ajar for the adoption of a brother or maternal uncle or his son or one's own daughter's. husband, which appears absurd to people. Besides the High Courts have recognised the adoption even of a daughter's son 1294 on the ground of custom by Daśastha smārta brāhmapas in the Dharwar District (vide Sundrabai v. Harmant 56 Bom. 298 ), by Telugu brāhmaṇas ( Viswasundara v. Somasundara 43 Mad. 876). Sūdras can adopt a daughter's or sister's or mother's sister's son all over India. The D, M. went so far as to say that a widow could not adopt her brother's son. 1295 The D. M. ignored the fact that the widow adopts to her husband ( and not to herself) who bore no relation to his wife's brother's wife and who could have himself adopted that son. The Bombay High Court and the Privy Council have discarded this absurd proposition of the D. M. Pannalal in 'Kumaun Local customs'

Dvyamu syāyana adoption

notes that in that part of India a daughter's or a sister's son may be adopted (p. 14 para 56). It has been recently held that the adoption of the illegitimate son of a woman even among šūdras is invalid. Vide Apya v. Ramakka I. L, R. (1941) Bom. 350. This was relied upon for holding that a woman cannot give in adoption an illegitimate son among Lingayats in Tirkangauda v. Shivappa A, I. R. (1944) Bom. 40. 

It is now necessary to pay a few words about the dvyāmu syāyana. A datlakı is of two kinds 1296, kevala (simple or ordinary ) and dvyūmuşyāyana ( the son of two fathers). When a man gives his only son in adoption to another under an agree ment that he is to be considered as the son of both the natural father (janaka or janaka-pitr) and of the adoptive father (pālaka ), the son so given is called duyāmu syāyana. The Bombay High Court has held that in order to constitute a dvyāmu syāyana an express agreement as stated above must be proved even when one brother adopts the only son of another 1297 A dvyāmusyāyaṇa inherits both in the natural and adoptive families.

ths smrtis as applicable to all such sons as the dattaka,kritains, The V. Mayukha quotes a prose passage from Katyayana (which is attributed to Paithinasi in D. C.) and the V. Mayakha, D. M. and D. C. all quote a verse (which is ascribed to Pravarādhyāya by the first and to Parijāta by the D. M.) that supports this. The D. M. and D. C. both quote two gūtras of Satyaşadha and Sabara's gloss (bhāşya) thereon in which the kşetroja is called nitya dvyāmuşyāyana and the dattaka and others are called anitya dvyāmuşyayapa. Yaj. II. 127 and Baud. Dh. S. II. %. 21 provide that a kşetraja is the son of both the begetter and of the husband of the wife on whom the son is procreated. Therefore such a son is called nitya dvyāmusyāyana (because he is always the son of two fathers ), When the kşetraja became obsolete and forbidden, the only dvyāmusyāyaṇa was an only son taken in adoption with a stipulation as described above. About the dattaka Maru IX. 142 states the general rule that the dattaka loses the gotra of his genetive father and assumes that of the adopter. But a dattaka belonged to two gotras according to some, if bis samskāras up to caula were performed in his natural family and the samskāra of upanayana and those that follow were performed in the adoptive family. Therefore it was not a general proposition that a dattaka always belonged to two gotras. If all the samakāras from jātakarma were performed by the adopter, then the dattaka would take the gotra of the adopter alone, Hence the sons called dattaka and 'the bought' were styled anitya dyyamusyayapas ( who were not in all cases dvyamusyāyanas). The D. M. states this 1299 twofold division of dvyāmuşyāyanas and employs the words nityavat or nitya and anityavut or anitya

The kşetraja became quite obsoleto many oenturies ago and the courts have held that the anitya dvyāmusyayapa is also now obsolete. 1300. It is now held that every adoption is presumed to be in the simple ( kevala) form, unless a stipulation that the boy will be the Bon of both is proved ( when it will be a dvyāmuşyāyana adoption). 

When a man is adopted in the dvyāmuşyāyaṇa form, his son born after such adoption has been held to inherit as grand son to the adoptive father, if the dvyāmuşyāyaṇa son died before the adoptive father. 1300a 

Ceremonies of Adoption. The most essential ingredient in adoption is the giving of the boy by the natural father and the taking of the boy by the adopter with the intention to transfer the boy to the family of the adopter. Another requisite (in some cases ) is the homa called dattahonu 1301 which as described by Saunaka and Baud, is given 1302 in the Appendix. It is not necessary that the daltahoma must be performed immediately after the giving and taking, but it may be performed later and its performance may be delegated to others when the giver or taker is a widow or a südra or is ill &o. Although in Vedic times women composed hymns and although Hārita and Yama stated that women had the upanayana performed on them and could study the Veda (H. Db. vol. II pp. 293-295), in later times it was held that women could not study the Veda, could not repeat Vedic mantras and therefore could not perform any homa (including dattahoma). Therefore some writers said that a widow could not adopt at all, while others like the V. Mayű. kha said that women are to be assimilated to śūdras and so just as a südra can get the dattaboma performed through a brāhmaṇa, so a widow, though she cannot herself engage in homa, may employ a brāhmaṇa to perform the dattahoma, Vide H. Dh. vol. II. pp. 365-368 (for deterioration in the

position of women), and note 1262 above and V. Mayükha quoted below. 1303 It has been held that the dattahoma is not 130 necessary among twice-born classes if the boy to be adopted belongs to the same gotra as that of the adoptive father. Jolly (in T. L. L. p. 160 ) states that the Dattakadarpapa refers to a text of Yama from the Sarasvativilāsa to the effect that homa is not absolutely essential in all cases. From Colebrooke's Digest V,4 CCLXXIII it appears that Jagannatha held the same view. The Dharmasindhu remarks that in certain countries an adop tion of a sagotra sapinda boy can be validly effected with the mere assent of the giver and adopter without Vedic ceremonies. There is a good deal of conflict in the case law on this point, which is passed over. Among südras no homa is necessary. The ceremony of adoption as described by Baud. gr. seşasūtra II 6. 4-9 ( which is probably the oldest on record and which was the one to be followed by the Taittiriyas or followers of the Black Yajurveda, according to D. M., Sań. K. p. 177 and the Dharma sindhu p. 161 ) is as follows: When about to take (in adoption) the adopter makes ready (or collects) the following viz. two pieces of cloth, two ear-rings, a finger ring, an acārya ( officiat ing priest) who is well versed in the Veda, a bundle of kuša grass, fuel sticks of palāśa (Butea Frondosa ). Then in the midst of invited relatives, after informing the ruler, he serves food to brāhmaṇas in the assembly hall or in the middle of the house. He ( the adopter) makes (the brāhmaṇas ) pronounce the benedictions May the day be auspicious! May you fare well! May there be prosperity !' and performs the acts (usual in all homas) from drawing lines on the altar up to carrying forward the Prapitā water, Vide H. of Dh. vol. II pp. 209-212 for the procedure common to all homes. Then he goes into the

presence of the giver and begs of him 'give me your son'. The other one (the giver ) says "I give'. He (adopter) then takes hold of the boy with the words 'I accept thee for the continuity (of my family). Then he decks (the boy) with the pieces of cloth, the ear-rings, the finger ring and performs the acts from laying fuel sticks round the altar up to the offering of oblations into fire ; he offers boiled rice into fire with the mantra 'yastvā hṛda' (Rg. V. 4. 10 or Tai. S. I. 4. 46. 1) as a puronuvākya 130$ (prayer of invitation) and with the mantra 'yasmai tvam sukrte' (Rg. V. 4. 11, Tai. S. I. 4. 46.1) as a yajya (prayer of worship or offering). Then having offered oblations of clarified butter with the vyāhrtis 1306 he performs the acts from the offe ring to Agni Sviştakst down to the giving of the cow and pre sents. He (the adopter) gives as dakşiņā (fee) to the priest these very pieces of cloth and rings (with which the boy was deoked ). 

The procedure laid down by Saunaka, who appears to be much later than Baud., is somewhat different (though there is a good deal common to both ) and is meant for the students of the Rgveda (acc. to Sam. K. p. 175). A few salient points may be noted. The adopter should fast the previous day, he sbould offer madhuparka to the officiating priest, should perform all the details from the placing of fuel sticks on the fire up to the purification of clarified butter with the blades of kusa grass, The giver recites (when begged) the five verses beginning with 'ye yajñena'(Rg. X. 62. 1-5) and the adopter holds the boy with both hands while repeating the mantra “devasya tva' (Ašv. gr I. 20. 4), mutters the çkangad-angad' ( quoted above on p. 641 12.1202) and smells the boy on his head. The adopter offers boiled rice with Rg. V. 4. 10, X. 85, 38, X. 85. 41-46. A much more elaborate procedure is set out in the V. Mayükha (pp. 120-12% text) and the Dharmasindhu (III pūrvārdha pp. 160-161). 

The results of adoption Adoption has the effect of trans ferring the adopted person from his natural family into the adoptive family. Adoption confers upon the adopted person the same rights and privileges in the family of adoption as the son

of the body (aurasa) except in a few well defined cages. The basic text on this point is that of Manu 1307 IX. 142 which may be literally rendered as follows: "The son given should not take tbe gotra (the family name) and the wealth of his natural father; the pinda (the cake of boiled rice offered to deceased ancestors in sraddhas ) follows the gatra and the wealth ( i. e. is invariably concomitant with them); of him who gives (his son in adoption) the svadha (obsequial rites) ceases (so far as that son is concerned)'. The preceding verse (Manu IX. 141) states that the adopted son takes the wealth of bis adoptive father and all that this verse says is that, after adoption, the son given in adoption does not take the name of his natural father and has no right in the wealth that then is the natural father's and that he does not perform the obsequial and śrāddha rites for his natural father. But from this verse a learned Hindu Judge derived the sweeping proposition that 'the theory of adoption depends upon the principle of a complete severance of the child adopted from the family in which he is born, both in respect to the paternal and maternal line, and his complete substitution into the adopter's family as if he were born in it'. There is no warrant for the idea of complete severance emphasized bere. This dictum was followed in many cases and was accepted by the Privy Counoil 1308 Another great Judge went so far as to

But this reading makes no change whatever in the meaning, since in ancient sūtras and smstis, the roots 'bhaj' and 'hr' and derivatives from them are used promiscuously in the same sense with regard to gotra and riktha.

say that 'an absolute adoption appears to operate as birth of the boy in the family of adoption and as civil death in the family of birth, having regard to the legal consequences that are incidents of such adoption o1309. But then the P. C, felt that matters were being carried too far and administered the warning 1310 that "As has been more than once observed the expressions 'civilly dead or as if he had never been born in the family are not for all purposes correct or logically applicable but they are complimentary to the term 'new birth'." We have to see what construction was put upon the verge of Manu by authoritative digests. The V. Mayükha explains Manu IX. 142 and arrives at the conclusion that the four words gora, riktha, pinda and svadhū are not to be taken literally but they are only used to indicate all those consequences only in relation to the natural father and the like that are brought about by their connection with the piụda and the verse of Manu conveys the cessation of all those consequences only. It further adds that the son on being given away in adoption ceases to have similar relationship to his brother, paternal uncle (in the family of birth). It should be noted that the V. Mayükha does not say that the son given away is dead to the family of birth or ceases to have any connection whatever with the members of the family of birth, but restricts the cessation of relation to the offering of piņda and the taking of the estate after he is adopted. The D. M. quotes 1311 the Sm, C. (II. 289 ) and holds that by the gift the adopted son ceases to have the same gotra as the giver. The D. O. (pp. 23-24 ) states 1312 the same proposi tion, without naming the Sm. O. The learned Judges who had to decide cases of adoption, even if they knew Sanskrit, do not generally appear to have consulted authoritative works other than the few that had been translated and were quite unaware as

to whether even the cessation of the pinda and gotra and of the right to wealth when a son was given away was so universally accepted by the leading Dharmaśāstra works as they thought. The Sarasvativilasa (p. 394) quotes a text of Visnu 1313 that even the adopted son should perform the obsequial rites of the natural father and explains that Manu IX. 142 applies when the natural father has no issue at the time of his death. Rudraskanda on Khadira gr.III. 5. 16 says the same. Kamalakara, the author of the Nirņayasindhu 1314 and a first cousin and contemporary of Nilakantha expressly states that Manu IX. 142 only applies when the natural fathor has a son or sons (other than the one given away) and quotes Katyāyana and Laugākşi cited in the Pravaramanjari (p. 146) in support. The Dharmasindhu1315 also says that when a boy of another gotra is adopted after his upanayana is performed in the family of birth or when only the upanayana is performed by the adoptive father, the adopted boy should repeat both gotras at the time of bowing at the feet of elders or in brāddha and other rites; but when all the cere monies including the cūda are performed by the adoptive father then the adopted boy has only one gotra (viz. that of the adopter ). 

The plain meaning of the verse of Manu (IX. 142) is that when a man gives away his son in adoption, then that son is transferred into another family, does not perform the sraddha and similar rites for the giver and cannot claim to take the wealth of his natural father as a son on the father's death or demand a partition from his father. The other son or gons

of the giver are to perform the srāddhas for the father and to suoceed to the family wealth. But this verse has been twisted by some High Court decisions to yield another rule. Suppose A, a Hindu, has an only son B. On A's death B takes the whole ancestral property as the only surviving co-parcener and then B is given in adoption by his mother to X. Suppose B has a daughter C born to him before his adoption to X. Does B forfeit the estate taken by him as the last surviving male with the result that on B's adoption to X his daughter O takes the estate ( which had already vested absolutely in B) as if he was dead in the family of A. The Bombay High Court has held in two decisions that on B's 1316 adoption to X in the above illustration he loses or forfeits the property he took as the last surviving co-parcener in the family of A and his daughter C would take the estate of B as if he were then dead ( though he is actually living ). The result of these decisions is that the verge of Manu is construed as laying down that though a man may have been absolutely entitled to certain property as a member of one family, on his adoption into another family he loses that estate which then passes on to his heir as if he had died on the day of adoption. This construction of the verse of Manu has not been accepted by the Madras and Calcutta High Courts, 1317 which hold that an adoption does not divest any property which has Vested in a man previous to his adoption into another family, It may be noted that the Bombay High Court itself gave a deci sion 1318 which is inconsistent in principle with the two decisions

If on adoption a separated copar. cener is not divosted of the estate already takea by him at a partition because the share taken by bim cannot be said to be the estate of his Datural father withio the meaning of Manu IX. 142, the estate taken by a sole surviving co-parconer also cannot be divested by his subsequent adop tion, because at the adoption it bad ceased to be the estate of his natural father long before the adoption, because when a co-parcener dies his rights lapse to the other co-parceners and because the root cause of being entitled to partition and taking as surviving coparceper is the same viz. the birth right of a son under the Mitaksara. - .

cited above, when it held that where a father and his four song partitioned ancestral family property and one of the song was subsequently given in adoption into another family, the son 80 adopted was not divested by the subsequent adoption of the property already taken by the son on partition. In a still later case the Bombay High Court approves of its first decision in 40 Bom. 429 and observos : 1319 'the verse of Manu refers not only to the riktha of the natural father but also to the gotra of the natural father. It is quite clear that the gotra of the natural father is vested in the son by his birth. The gotra so vested in the-son ceases after the son is given in adoption. It is difficult to understand why the riktha which is spoken of in the same manner as gotra in the verse should not cease by the entire cessa tion of connection with the natural family. The gotra and riktha are inextricably joined together in a dvandva compound and it would follow logically as well as grammatically that the adopted son must lose both together and cannot lose the former and keep the latter.' In this passage the premiss that there is entire cessation of connection with the natural family is entirely wrong as has already been shown and will be shown a little later on. The adoptee's connection with the gotra of the natural family does not cease for all purposes at all. Therefore the reasoning of the passage quoted above is entirely misconceived and is further opposed to two well known rules of the Mimarsi evolved for the construction of texts. On: the interpretation given to Manu IX. 142 by the Bombay deci sions that verse lays down two rules (vidhis ), viz. (1) a person adopted into another family will not take the wealth of his natural father or any one in that family after adoption; (2) that a person adopted into another family loses or forfeite on adoption wealth that he may have already taken absolutely in the natural family as a member of that family before adoption. These are two entirely different propositions and the rule of mimamsā is that one and the same sentence 137 should not be construed as laying down two rules (vidhis) applicable to diffe rent sets of circumstances. To so construe a text is to be guilty

of the fault of vakyabheda (splitting up of a sentence 80 as to yield two distinot rules). The. V. Mayūkha construed Manu IX 14% so as to indicate only one sense and avoid the fault of vākyabheda on the analogy of two examples discussed in the Půrvamimāṁsā 1321 works, but if the reasoning of the Bombay High Court were followed the same fault to avoid which Nila kantha strives hard would be committed. There is another mimāṁsā rule 1822 which will be violated by the Bombay High Court's interpretation of Manu IX. 142 vix, when an already existing thing or entity and something to be accomplished or brought about in future are spoken of together in a sentence the thing already existing or accomplished is mentioned simply for the sake of the thing to be accomplished. The aocomplished fact is adoption itself. Manu who mentions adoption or the adopted son which is an accomplished entity also mentions along with it the taking of property (rikthaharana); hence that taking must have reference to the future bringing about and not the undoing of rikthaharana which had already taken place long before. 

That the gotra of the natural family persists in some matters even after a person is adopted is made clear by the digests. The Sam. 1323 K, (p. 182) says that every dattaka must, when entering on marriage, avoid the gotra of his natural as also of his adoptive father. The Dharmasindhu (III. p. 161) says the same and states that the prohibition against marriage

with a girl of the gotras of the natural and adoptive fathers is absolute and not restrioted to saven or five degrees. Thus if there is no total or absolute cessation of gotra relation with the natural family for all purposes there is no reason why in the Case of wealth already taken before adoption there should be a cessation or forfeiture or why the cessation of relation as to riktha should not be restricted to the future. As regards sapiņda relationship there is some conflict among the digests. The D, M. 1234 states that the dvyānusyāyana has to observe the prohibitions against marrying a sapiņda girl up to three degrees in the families of the natural father and of the adoptive father, while the simple dattaka has to observe sapinda rela tionship based upon the presentation of rice balls in the adoptive father's family for three generations (since the adopted son can generally have no particles of the body in common with the adop tive father) and in the natural family sapinda relationship based upon particles of the same body for seven generations. The Nirnayasindhu (III. pp. 290-291) sets out the various conflicting views and gives it as its own opinion that the sapinda relation ship must be looked to in marriage up to seven generations in the natural as well as in the adoptive family (in the latter it being based on the offering of balls of rice). According to the V. Mayūkha (p. 119) the simple adopted son has sapiņda rela tionship in the adoptive father's family for seven generations and in the adoptive mother's family for five generations and it seems to hold that there is no sapinda relationship in the natural family ( owing to Manu IX. 142). The D. C. (pp. 61 66 ) appears to hold that the dvyāmuşyāyaṇa has to observe sapiņda relationship (as stated in the D. M.), while as to the simple dattaka there is sapipda relationship only in the adop tive family for seven generations (as indicated by Manu IX. 142 ). The Dharmasindhu (III. p. 161) states that sapinda relationship depends in its degrees on the question whether the adoption is made after upanayana in the natural family or be foro upanayana or whether all samskāras from jatakarma are performed in the adoptive family.

:: The Bombay High Court 1325 has held that the adopted son cannot marry within prohibited degrees in the natural family, that to that extent an adopted son cannot be considered as not to have been born in his natural family and that the sapinda relationship is recognized in both the families for the purpose of prohibition of marriage. - The Nir, 8., the Dharmasindhu 1326 and the D. O. pp. 48-49 declare that the adopted son can perform the sraddha of his natural father if the latter has at his death no son or other qualified person to perform it. The Nir. S. and the Sar, 1327 K. (pp. 185-186)- both say that the adopted son has to observe three days' mourning on the death of the natural father and vice versa; but the D. M. and D. O. (p. 68 ) differ and state that the simple adopted son has to observe no mourning for his natural father or other relatives in the natural family. If a married man having a son is given in adoption (which is possi ble in the Bombay Presidency) the son (born before the adop tion) remains in the natural family and does not acquire the gotra and rights to property of the family into which his father is adopted. Yet the father who has gone into another family by adoption has been held to retain his right to give in adoption his son who was born before his own adoption and who remains in the natural family 1328 

From the above discussion it follows that the person adopted retains the tie of blood with his natural family ( 80 that he cannot marry a girl within the prohibited degrees from that family ), the samskāras already performed in the natural family are not repeated on him after adoption, he still-retains the gotra so far that he cannot marry a girl having the same gotra as his natural father and further he has according to most writers to observe mourning for his natural father. Therefore it is clear that the severance from the natural family brought about by adoption is only partial and restricted to piņda and riktha

The adopted son is entitled to inherit in the adoptive family as fully as if he were a natural born son i. e. he may inherit not only to his adoptive father, but also to that father's brother or cousin if the latter have no son or no other nearer heir. The adopted son also inherits to the adoptive mother and her rela tions 1339 viz. her father and brother. Conversely, the adoptive mother and her relations in her father's family are entitled to inherit to him. 

Vas, and Baud. both laid down that if after a son is taken In adoption an aurasa son is born to the adoptive father the former takes a fourth share. There is confict among the smftis and the digests about the share of the adopted son when an aurasa is subsequently born, and about the meaning of 'a fourth share'. The Dayabhāga. (X. 13 p. 148) and V. C. p. 150 quote a verso of Katyāyana 1330 that when an aurasa son is born, other kinds of sons, if of the same caste as the father, take only a third of the estate. It has been held in Bengal that in these circumstances the adopted son takes one third of his adoptive father's estate. In Benares and among Jains 1331 the adopted son gets one fourth of the estate. The S. V. p. 393 holds that he gets 1332 7th. In Bombay it 1383, has been held that the adopted son takes not 7th of the whole estate, but ith of the share of the aurasa son i. e. Ith (the aurasa son taking $ths). In Bombay the same rule applies among śūdras. 1334 But in Bengal and Madras it has been decided, relying on a passage in the - 1329. a ut HOT fa sfarsitent APT affat gø formarvey Trang HATHAITI 4. t. p. 198; N F sinetron ATRO forum for I TU, P. 61.

Falugaratga va T FTY 7. . pp. 89-90. 1338a. It appears to me that the V. Mayükha went far beyond the spirit of the ancient smrti texts and of most of the medieval digests when it allowed the adoption of a married man or even of one who had already had a son. The son to be adopted, it was declared by Saunaka and others, abould be a reflection of an aurasa son. Therefore he must be adopted at ad age when by proper training and environment he will come to eotertala towards the adoptive parents the same feeling that an aurasa son bas. Hence it appears to me that the Legislature should intervene and provide that no one can be adopted after his upanayana, or at all events after his marriage, in the datural family. It is natural for a sonloss man or a widow to feel, apart from religious considerations, the necessity of a young person o a solace, security and help in old age, and to adopt a person. Even la England by the Adoption of Chidren Act (16 and 17 Goo. V. chap. 29) the adoption of a minor is now allowed after observing cortain formalities, Further, ao adoption by a widow who has sot bocomo major according to the ladian Majority Act should be held valid. An agreement or a transfer of the smallest property by a person who is a minor according to that Act is bald to be absolutely null and void. There is no reason why an adoption by 4 widow of 15 or 16 should be uphold when that adoption diventa her of al (or now half of the property of the husband held by her. - : , ; 

CHAPTER XXIX 

ORDER OF SUCCESSION AFTER THE SON 

It has been stated above that daya is either apratibandha or sapratibandha and that sons, grandsons and great-grandsons take the first kind of daya. If a man has no son either aurasa or secondary (viz. the dattaka, the other kinds of sons being now forbidden or obsolete), then his property devolvos in a certain order. When a man dies sonless and is a member of a joint Hindu family then on the surviving coparceners the whole estate devolves except that after 1937 (by Act XVIII of 1937) his widow takes his place as to the joint family property. But if he dies separated and has male issue (from whom also he is separate ) then his male issue will succeed to him in a body viz. his son, grandson (son of a predeceased son) and great grandson (son of a predeceased son's predeceased son) will together take his separate property per stirpes. From Manu IX. 137 ( which is the same as Vas. 17.5 and Vişnu Dh. 8. 15. 46 ) and 186 and Yaj. I 78 it follows that the son, grandson and great grandson equally confer great spiritual benefit and so are the principal group of heirs. According to the strict theory of the Mitakşarā as stated above, son, grandson and great-grandson take by birth an interest even in property acquired by a man him self, but they have no power to prevent him from alienating it. If one or more out of a man's sons, grand-sons or great-grandsons are separate from him then on his death his self-acquired property will first be taken by those sons, grandsons and great grandsons that are joint with him and if none of these is joint. with him, the separated son, grandson and great-grandson will Bucceed per stirpes to his estate, 1339 

This view is at least as old as the Baud. 1340 Dh. 8. 1. 5. 113 115 which speak of the three ascendants of a man, of himself,

of his full brothers and of his son, grandson and great-grand son from a bavarna wife as one group called avibhakta-daya sapindas and that in the absence of these only, the wealth of a man goes to his sakulyas. 

On the succession to the property of a man dying without male issue (i. 8. without son, grandson or great-grandson) the basic texts are two verses of Yājñavalkya 141 (II. 135-136 ): 'The lawfully wedded wife, the daughters and the daughter's son), the parents, the brothers, their sons, gotrajas (agnatic kingmen), bandhu (cognatic relation), a pupil, a fellow student-on failure of each preceding one out of these each succeeding one is entitled to take the wealth of a man who is dead ( lit. who has gone to heaven) and who leaves no male issue. This rule applies to all varnas', The Visņu Dh. . (17. 4-15) is almost to the same effect. The word ' aputrasya' in Yāj. is taken to mean one having no son, grandson or great-grandson (at the time of death ) by V. C., Raghunandana and Mitramiśra 1343. The Mit. explains the words' to all varpas' as applying even to all that are the offspring of anuloma or pratiloma unions. 

We have separate rules for inheritance to the property of males and to that of females. Then there is great difference as to the rights of women as heirs. First, inheritance to the property of males will be taken up. Here again the fundamental principles are different aco, to the Mit. and the Dayabhāga.. 

Among the heirs (apart from male issue) of a man as regards his separate property the first is the widow. The wife's right to succeed to her deceased husband's estate, when he died separated and un-reunited, was acknowledged only after a long struggle extending over centuries. The passage of the Tal. 8. VI. 5. 8. 2 speaking of women as 'adayādih' has already

been quoted (on p.606). The meaning of that word is somewhat dubious, as will be shown later on. The Āp. Dh. 8. II. 6. 14. 2 states generally 1343 that in default of a son the nearest sapinda succeeds but does not expressly mention the wife as an heir, though it mentions ( in 11. 6. 14. 4) the daughter as a possible Hotr. Baud. also omits the wife as an heir. Vas. mentions no woman as heir. Gaut. 28. 19 appears to state that the wealth of one who dies without issue should be taken by his sapiņdas, sagotras and sapravaras or his wife (i. e. according to Haradatta, the wife takes a share only along with the nearest sapinda or gagotra and not exclusively ). Haradatta himself was of this view. Manu does not declare that the wife is the heir of a sonless man and there are certain passages wbich impliedly exclude her, as 6. 8. Manu IX, 185 ( the father takes the wealth of a map dying sonlegs or his brothers take it ), IX, 217 (the mother should take the woalth of a sonless man). Sankha (q. by the Mit., Dayabhaga XI. 1. 15 ) prescribes that the wealth of a man dying without issue goes to his brothers, failing them the parents take it or the eldest wife. 1344 Devala (q. by the Dayabhaga XI. 1. 17-18 and V. R. p. 593 ) arranges the heirs in order as full brothers, daughters, father, half brothers, mother and wife. It may be noticed that in the days of Kalidasa the sonless widow did not succeed to the wealth of her deceased husband, but was only entitled to maintenance and that the estate escheated to the king. This is clear from the letter written by the minister to king Dugyanta about the wealth of a merchant who perished in a ship-wrook (.ACT VI). Yāj. and Vispu among empti writers were probably the first to clearly enunciate the rule that the wife was the foremost heir of a man dying without male issue. Br. makes the wife the first heir of a sonless man and supports his

opinion with reasons. He says : 1345 'In the Voda and in the doctrines of the smrtis and in popular usage the wife is declared to be half the body of the husband, equally sharing the consegu ences of good and evil acts. Of him whose wife is not dead half the body survives. How can another obtain the property, while half the body (of the deceased ) lives? Although kinsmen, although his father, mother or his relatives may be alive, the wife of a man dying without issue succeeds to his share, A wife dying before her husband takes away his sacred fires (i. e. she is cremated with the sacred Vedic fires, if he be an Agnihotrin); but when the husband dies before the wife, she takes his property, if she be chaste'. Even when Yaj. proclaim ed the paramount right of succession in the case of widows there were other smrtis and some early commentators who dia not subscribe to that view. Nār. ( dāyabhāga, 25-26 ) provides that if among several brothers one who is childless dies or becomes an ascetic the others should divide the property except ing stridhana, that they should make provision for his women till their death in case they remain faithful but if they are otherwise (i..e. unfaithful) they may cut off the allowance: Nār. (dāyabhāga, 50-51 ) provides that on failure of sons, the daughter, sakulyas, bandhus, a man of the same caste, the king succeed in order and thus omits the wife altogether. Vyāsa 1346 ( quoted by Haradatta on Gaut. 28.19 and by Sm. O. II. p. 281 ) holds that a wife may take the whole of the husband's property if it does not exceed 2000 paņas in value.

the property is small, but only maintenance if the property 1s large and refutes it by saying that it is opposed to the spirit of Yii who allows & share to the wife and the mother oven along with sons when even joint family property is being partitioned and that the view is also liable to the fault of vidhivaizamya on the analogy of the Mimāmgā rule stated above on p. 605. 1347 The same text of Yāj. will have to be held as laying down only maintenance when the husband left great wealth, and also laying down a share equal to that of a son when the husband leaves inconsiderable wealth, 1347a Another view was maintained

The मिता. says that this really means that there are two courses open to the widow, viz. she may remaia cbaste and succeed along with the sapindas or she may resort to niyoga. 

1347a. Jai. VII. 3. 19-25 as understood by the Mit, may be briefly explaised as follows: The Cāturmāsyas (seasonal sacrifices) are four, Vaišvadeva, Varuņapraghāsa, Sākamedba, Supāsiriya (vide H. of Dh. vol. II. pp. 1091-1105 for description). In regard to these the following texts occur in tho Veda and are cited by Sabara and others : re: soranitesi

Pranayana means 

carrying towards the east fire from the Gārhapatya fire to the Abavaniya.' There is pranayana in the Darsapūrņamāsa which is simple (and without details) and there is also pranayana ia Agaisjoma wbich is full of details (and not simple). An uttaravedi (vide H. of Dh. vol. II, pp. 1096–1097 for description ) is not required in Darsapūrgamāsa, but it is required in a Soma sacrifice. The cāturmāsyas are modifications (vikrti) of the Darsapūrga māsa, so that whatever is prescribed in the latter follows in the absence of express directions as a matter of course in the formerIn the texts quoted above the words 'dvayoḥ pranayanti' lay down a vidhi and the words 

tarmād... takamed basca ' contain an arthavada which forms a syntactical whole with the vidbi and which only ealogizes it. The purvapaksa argues ; As cāturmāsyas aro modifications of Daršapūrnamāsa, it is unnecessary to lay down axprosaly a simple pranayana io them; therefore, the prapayana prescribed in dvayoḥ pranayapti' must be the pranayana as described in a Soms sacrifice. Further the prohibition of an uttaravedi in Vaisvaveda and Supisiriya indicates the same, since a prohibition implies tbat there was a faar that what is prohibited would bave otherwise followed and since an

(Continued from the last page) uttaravedi is required only in a Soma sacrifice. Therefore the pranayana prescribed in dvayoḥ pranayanti' is of the Somapranayana type. To this a partisan of the siddhāntin (siddhaotaikadesin) replies as follows:---The real view is that in dvayoḥ pranayanti the prapayana is of the simple darśa pūraamāsa type and the prohibition about Vaišvadeva and Sunāsiriya is not to be explained as you do; in the words 'upātra vapanti' an uttaravedi is generally (without exception) prescribed for all cāturmāsyas, but in the following two sentences 'na vaiśvadeve &c.' the preparation of uttaravedi is forbidden in the case of Vaisvadeva and Sunāsiriya ; therefore the partisan says that the idea is that, though the pranayana is of the simple darśapūrna māsa type, yet an uttaravedi is prepared in the 2nd and 3rd but not in the first and fourth of the cāturmāsyas. The pūrvapaksin retorts that even on this construction vidhivaişamya would still be tliere as follows: as there is prescription of uttaravedi in all four and prohibition in two (viz, the first and fourth of the four cāturmāsyas), there is an option of uttaravedi in these latter two (as the rule is 'tulyabala-virodhe vikalpaḥ') and there is no option as to the other two and there will arise the fault of vidhivaişanya, the same sentence viz. 'upātra vapanti' being taken as an unqualified and independent rule about the 2nd and 3rd of the cāturmāsyas and taken as an optional rule as to the Ist and 4th. 

The proper siddhanta view is as follows: Though the words 'dvayol pranayanti' are very general, they are to be narrowed down so as to refer to only two (viz. 2nd and 3rd of the cāturmāsyas) on account of the recom mendatory passage that follows ( speaking of Varunapragbasa and Sākamedha as the thighs of cāturmāsya yajña). The vidhi and the following arthavada form one syntactical whole (ekavākya), as laid down by Jai, 1. 2. 7. The arthavāda passage means that just as a man marches on in strength if his thighs are strong, so the cāturmāsya sacrifice reaches a successful close by means of Varunapragbāsa and Sākamedha in which an uttarvedi is specially prepared and fire is laid thereon (being taken from the āhavaniya fire by the adhvaryu and pratiprasthātr). Therefore the meaning is that there is prana yana in the 2nd and 3rd out of the four cāturmāsyas and uttaravedi is pres cribed in those two alone and the words 'there is no uttaravedi in Vaisva deva and Sunāsiriya' are a mere anuvada (repetition of what is already known) and not a probibition, as in the words 'fire should be kindled on the carth and not in the sky nor in heaven'. On this interpretation there is no vidhivaisamya. Sabara makes two adhikaranas of Jai, VII. 3. 19-25, while Kumārila makes one adhikarana of these seven sutras, He further differs as to the siddbāate, which, according to him, is that in dvayoh pranayanti' there is a special (apürva) kind of pranayana prescribed, prākrta (of darśapürnamāsa type) and saumika pranayana being the two other views which he rejects. The Subodhini on the Mit. very lucidly explains this discussion and concludes: यथा सकदेशिमते विधिवैषम्य दोषस्तथा

take the estate of her sonless deceased husband if she submitted to niyoga and procured a son for the husband. This view derived support from Gautama 28.19-20, Vas. 17.65 (who prohibits niyoga if resorted to through greed of wealth), and Manu IX: 146 and 190 ( which call upon the surviving brother to pro create a son on the widow of his brother and to hand over the deceased's share to that son).

Many writers note that the smrti texts on the heirship of the widow are in conflict. 1351 They explain verses like those of Nar. (dayabhaga 25-26) providing only maintenance for women either as

referring to exolusively kept concubines of the deceased or to the wives of re-united coparceners. 

Patni means a woman wbo is married to the deceased, the word being formed from. 'pati' with an affix in the genge of 'being fit to join with the husband in the performance of sacri fice' (Pāṇini IV. 1. 33). The Sm. C. II. p. 290 quotes a Verge that a woman who is procured for sexual intercourse in exchange for money is only a dāsi and is not a patni and therefore is not entitled to inherit to a sonless paramour. 1352 The Baud. Dh. S. 1. 11. 20 quotes a similar verse. Several texts require that the widow must be chaste before she can claim the inheritance of the deceased. A text attributed to Vṛddha Manu 1353 says, 'The wife alone, being sonless and keeping the bed of her lord unsullied and leading a life of religious obger vances, may offer pinda to her deceased husband and take his entire estate'. Kāt. ( 926 ) also declares that 'the wife who is chaste takes the wealth of her husband'. The widow must be chaste at the time the inheritance opens. The courts have held that once the husband's estate is Tested in the widow, it will not be divested or forfeited by reason of unchastity subsequent to the death of the husband. 1354 If the widow remarries after inheriting, then, though the remarriage of a widow is legalized by the Hindu Widows' Remarriage Act.(XV of 1856 ), she forfeits the estate of the husband taken by her or the estate which she took as a widowed mother of her deceased son and it passes to the other heirs of the husband or son as if she were then dead and this applies to widows of all castes according to almost all High Courts ( even when remarriage

is allowed by the custom of the caste to which the widow belongs ). 1355 

According to the Dayabhāga there being no apratibandha daya, the widow of a sonless member even in a joint family succeeds to his share in the family property and there is no difference between joint family property and separate property. 

In the case of sūdras, if the owner dies leaving a widow or a daughter or a daughter's son and an illegitimate son, it has been held by the courts following Yaj. II. 134, the Mit, and Dayabhāga IX. 31 that the widow or daughter or daughter's son takes one half and the illegitimate son takes the other half. 1356 

The rights of the widow in property inherited by her from her husband are limited. Kauţ, III, 2 was 1357 probably the first to propound clearly the characteristics of the Hindu widow's estate and the verse of Kat. quoted below is remarkably close to the words of Kaut.

B.) holds that a woman belonging to a caste in wbich remarriage of widows is allowed by custom does not forfeit on remarriage the estate of the Grst husband which she took as his widow, the principal reasons being that there is no express text about forfeiture on subsequent unchastity and that it would be absurd to hold that a widow, who, on the P. C. ruling in 7 1, A., does not forfelt the estate taken as heir by subsequent unchastity, should be liable to forfeit it by remarriage (which presumes that she wants to live a decent life). Looking to the expressed object of the Hipdu Widows' Remarriage Act, section 2 should not have been $0 interpreted as to apply to widows who could remarry according to caste custom before the Act.

Characteristics of widow's estate

husband's estate (by gift, sale &c.). Br. 1538 (S. B. E. vol. 33 pp. 377-78 verses 50-51 and 53 ) states : 'when the husband is separate his widow takes all his various kinds of property such as a pledge, except immovable property. After having received movable and immovable property, gold, inferior metals, grain, liquids and clothes the widow shall cause (her husband's) monthly, six-monthly and annual srāddhas to be performed. Let her honour with funeral offerings and pious charity her husband's paternal uncle, gurus ( elders ), daughter's son, sister's son and maternal uncle as also aged or helpless persons, guests and women'. Mādhava (Par. M. III. p. 536 ) explains that 'except immovable property' means that she is prohibited from making a sale of immovable property without the consent of the male kinsmen. The V. Mayükha (p. 138 ) accepts this interpretation and modern courts have done the same. In Damodardas v. Purmanandas y Bom. 155 it was held that a widow to whom movable property was bequeathed by the will of her husband takes it absolutely. But here the movable property was not inherited by her and as it was a bequest by will it became her stridhana according to Nār. ( q. by V. M. on p. 155 ). Besides, this was a cage from Bombay Island and was governed by the law of V. Mayūkha. In some early cases in Bombay it had been held that a widow in Western India under the Mitākşarā had absolute power over the movable property inherited by her from her husband. In Gadadhar 1. Chandrabhagabai 17 Bom. 690 (F. B.) it was held that under the law of the Mitākşarā a widow has no power to bequeath move able property inherited by her from her husband and that to that extent the decision in Damodar v. Purmanandas must be treated as of no authority if it be interpreted to have decided the point in that way. In Sha Chamanlal v. Doshi Ganesh 28 Bom, 453 it was decided that even under the Mayūkha a widow inheriting movable property from her husband has no

power to dispose of it by will. Lastly in Pandharinath v. Govind 32 Bom. 59 it was held, after an elaborate examination of authorities, that a widow is not under the Mitakşarā competent to make a gift of the movables inherited by her from her husband and it was said (on p.75 ) that possibly with the spread of education amongst, and the general emancipa. tion of, their women Hindus may be led to call in aid the relief of Legislature. In cases arising under the Mayūkha & widow may dispose of movable property inherited by her from her husband by gift inter vivos but not by will. Kat. 1359 (921, 924-925) propounds the limitations of the widow's rights as follows: ' A sonless widow, preserving the bed of her husband (unsullied) and residing with her elders and being self-controlled, should enjoy (her husband's property ) till her death; after her the (other) heirs (of the husband) would get it. A wife who preserves ( the honour of) the family would get the share of her husband when he is dead till her death, but she has no power to make a gift, sale or mortgage. A widow engrossed in religious observances and fasts, fixed in the vow of celibacy, always intent on restraining her senses and making gifts goos to heaven oven though sonless', 1360 These verses show that the widow was to enjoy the income of her husband's property till her death; that she could not sell or mortgage or give away immovable property without the consent of the heirs that would come after her and that for religious and charitable purposes or those that conduce to the spiritual welfare of her husband a widow had large powers of disposition. These rules

Limitations on widow's estate 

have been accepted by modern decisions; vide Collector of Masulipatam v. Cavaly Vencatu 8 Moo. I. A. 500 at p. 551 for an oftquoted pagsage about the widow's powers of disposal. There is a large volume of case law on the widow's powers of aliena tion, on what are religious and charitable purposes and about the consent of the kinsmen, which have to be passed over here. The heir or heirs expectant on the death of a widow are called reversioners or reversionary heirs in the decided cases. There is no exact Sanskrit word to convey the same idea except * dāyāda' that occurs in Kāt. quoted above and in D. B., which makes it clear that the reversioners take the estate after the widow's estate ends ( by death, remarriage, surrender &c.). The doctrine of the surrender by the widow of her estate in favour of the next heirs (the reversioners ) whose estate is said to be accelerated is based on meagre foundations viz. the words of Kat, and the D. B. quoted in n. 1359. Judicial decisions, how over, have raised a stupendous structure on these slight founda tions ; but they are passed over here. 

If a man dies leaving several widows then they may partition the property equally among themselves, as stated by the Mit. 1361 

If after partitioning among themselves, one of the widows dies, the portion given to her comes to the other widow or widows i, e, there is survivorship among them and no one else can succeed to the husband's property as long as there is any widow alive and not remarried. Hindu Law does not favour the distribution of a deceased man's estate among his several relatives, as some other systems (like that of the Moslems) do. It gives the whole estate to one heir or one class of heirs to the exclusion of all others. It is greatly to the credit of the ancient Hindu Law that it boldly gave all the separate property of a deceased male to women, viz. to the widow and after her to the daughter in preference to the man's own father or brother or nephew. Attempts are now being made through the Legislature that even when there are sons, the widow and daughters of the deceased should be given shares. Though these efforts spring from the laudable motive of en larging the rights of women, they do not deserve unqualified encouragement. They will produce friotion, cause fragmenta

tion of lands, make holdings uneconomic and it is extremely doubtful whether they are in the best interests of society or nation as a whole and whether the vast mass of Hindus want them. Prajapati 1362 says that the king should punish as thieves those sapiņdas and relatives that oppose or obstruct a widow in succeeding to her husband's estate. 

The words of the Tai S. quoted above (p. 606 ) about women being without strength and not entitled to dāya (adāyādih) really occur in the ritual of Soma offerings and should mean that women are not allowed to share in the drinking of Soma. But the Baud, Dh. S. (8. B. E. vol. 14 p. 231 ) appears to have taken them as excluding women from inheritance. Manu IX. 18 also relies on it and declares that the samskūras on women (except marriage) are not to be performed with Vedic mantras, as the Veda declares them to be 'nirindriya' and 'anta'. Later writers like Haradatta (on Gaut. 28. 19, Ap. Dh. S. II. 6. 14. 1) and V. P. pp. 517 and 554 base the exclusion of women from inheritance on this passage of the Veda. They say that, though the Vedic text is very sweeping and general, it is meant to oxclude only women other than those expressly mentioned in the smrtis as entitled to inherit. For example, the Dāyabhāga XI. 6. 11 quotes Baud. and remarks that the wife is entitled to inherit because of special texts (like those of Yāj. and Vispu) in her favour, The Sm, C. II. p. 294 1363 says that the Vedic passage is only an arthavāda (meant for praise ) and not an absolute rule and it must be taken as not referring to those women that are expressly mentioned (lit. by being seized by the horn). The V. P. says the same. Aparārka (p. 743 ) holds that the Vedic passage is merely an anuvada and excludes women only when there is a son. It should be noted that the Par. M. (II. p. 536) holds that the Tai. S. passage merely means that the wife of the sacrificer is not entitled to partake of Soma

taken in the Pātnivata cup and that 'indriya' means Soma drink. 134 "But Madhavācarya in his comment on the Tai, S. I. 4.27 quotes Tai. S. VI. 5. 8. 2 and explains it somewhat differently 88 meaning that women being without strength do not take the heritage when there are children. It is very remarkable that both the Mit. and the V. Mayūkha do not at all refer to the Tai. 8. or Baud. Dh. 8. in speaking of the rights of women to inheritance. It cannot be said that they were unaware of them, but probably they took the Tai. S, text in the sense in which the Par. M. explains it. The result of the reliance on the Tai. S. and on Baud. by most medieval digests has been that in the whole of India except in the Madras and Bombay provinces only five females are recognized as heirs viz. the widow, the daughter, the mother, the father's mother and paternal grand-father's mother, because they were expressly mentioned as heirs in the smftis or early commentaries. This 

subject will be pursued further a little later on. 

• The right of the wife to maintenance during her husband's life time has already been dealt with in H. of Dh. II. pp. 568-569. If the wife was guilty of unchastity but repented of her lapse, she was still entitled to be maintained by the husband ( vide H. of Dh. II. pp. 571-573 ). As regards the rights of mainten ance of the widows of deceased members of a joint Hindu family there is a good deal of case law which is passed over here. One or two points may be noted. The right of the widows in a joint Hindu family are conditional upon their leading a life of chastity. Male members are often unwilling to maintain widows who are often compelled to go to court. In the 'Selections from Peshwa Daftar', vol. 43, there is an order ( letter No. 14% ).of Rāmagāstri, the chief justice of the Peshwa's court, calling upon one Bapuji Tambavekar under threat of penalties to restore the ornaments of the widow of his elder brother (that had died only seven days after marriage ) and to give her yearly maintenance of Rs. 125.

History of Dharmasastra - I Vol. struggle hard for recognition as hoir just as the widow had. Gaut., Baud. and Vas. omit the daughter as an heir. Āp. Dh. 8. II. 6. 143 recognizes the daughter as an optional hotr (probably with sapindas). When Manu IX, 130 declares, 'one's Bon is like one's self and one's daughter is equal to one's son ; how can another person take the wealth of the deceased) when she who is the very self (of the deceased) lives', it appears from the context (IX. 128-129) that it is the pritrika ( the daughter appointed as a son) that is intended to be referred to therein. Medhatithi, Narayapa and Kullūka interpret the word * duhita ' in Manu IX, 130 as applicable to the putrikā only. In the Nirukta,135 Yaska cites Rg. III. 31. 1 as relied upon by those who support the claims of the daughter to inheritance and also derives the word 'duhitā' in various ways, but from his expla nation of Rg. III. 31. 1 it appears that he is referring to the putrika's right of inheritance. As the usage of appointing a daughter as a son became gradually obsolete, the ordinary daughter came to be recognized by analogy as the heir of a sonloss man after the widow. Yaj. and Vişnu both recognize the daughter as an heir after the widow. Nar. (dāyabhāga, 50 ) recognizes 1356 the daughter as an heir after the son on the ground that she continues the lineage ( of the deceased father) just like & son. When Nar. (dāyabhaga, 27 ) speaks of the daughter being entitled to maintenance till marriage, the con text shows ( as remarked by the Sm. O. II. p. 296 ) that he is referring to the daughter of a person who was re-united at the time of his death. Br. declares 1367 ( 8. B. E. 33 p. 378 verkar 55-56 ), the wife is declared to be the inheritor of the husband's wealth and, in default of har, the daughter; the daughter, like a son, springs from the limbs of a man: how can another man inherit her father's property while she lives?', Though the words of Yaj., Vişņu and Bș. were clear enough ancient com.

mentators were not prepared to accept them in their literal Pense. . Visvaripa holds that Yaj. means only the putrika and employs the plural in order to convey that several daughters may be appointed as sons. The Sm. O. II. p. 295 informs us that the same opinion was held by Dhāreśvara, Davasvamin and Devarāta. 1368 . The Mit. rightly refutes these views by saying that the word ' duhitarah in Yaj. cannot refer to 'putrika', since Yaj., has himself stated the putrikā as equal to the aurasa son (in II. 128), as the putrika is included among the sons by Vas, and as the widow and the daughters are declared by him as heirs in the absence of all the sons, principal and secon dary. Yaj., Vişnu, Bf. are silent as to whether any discrimina tion was made between daughters as heirs. Kat. (926) gives1369 a preference to the unmarried daughter and the Mit. and the subsequent digests follow Kate The Dayabhaga1370 (XI.2.4 p. 175) quotes a prose passage of Parasara preferring an un married daughter as an heir to a married daughter. Among married daughters the Mit., pressing into service a text of Gaut. on succession to stridhana, holds by analogy that among married daughters the indigent (or unprovided for) one is to be preferred to one who is well-placed. 1371 Heroin the Miti follows common sense and the natural inclination of a father to feel more concern for a poor daughter. The Dayabbage prefers the unmarried daughter to the married daughter as la done by the Mit., but among married daughters Jimātaythana, following an author oalled Dikşita, prefers one who has had a

son or who is likely to have a son to a widowed or barren daughter or to one who has given birth only to daughters. This preference is due to the principle of the Dayabhāga 1373 that spiritual benefit is the governing factor in succession. The barren daughter or widowed daughter is unable to confor spiritual benefit on her father since she will have no son that will offer pindas to the deceased owner (who will be the mater nal grand-father). The Mit. on the other hand relies on near ness of blood (prattyāsatti) as the guiding principle. But, de pointed out by the V. P. p. 519, the Dayabhāga is inconsistent. There is no reason on its own principle why the unmarried daughter should be preferred to a married daughter who has a son. The latter is then and there capable of conferring spiri tual benefit while it is problematical whether the unmarried daughter will confer spiritual benefit (since she may after all be blessed with no son after marriage ). Aparārka (p.721 ) and V. R. (p. 517) give three meanings of the word ' apratisthita' vis. 'childless, poor, widowed'. In deciding whether a parti oular married daughter is indigent as compared with another, the Courts refuse 1373 to go into nice or minute questions of the respective monetary positions of their husbands and prefer one to the other only if there is great disparity or marked difference between their positions.

According to all High Courts in India except that of Bombay a daughter's estate is similar to that of the widow, She takes only a limited interest, can only enjoy the usufruot of the property and cannot alienate it. On her death the estate passée not to her heirs, but to the next heir of her father. In Bombay, 1374 however, the daughter takes an absolute interest

Succession of daughters 

717 

In her father's estate when she succeeds as heir and on her death the estate will go to her own heirs. 

A daughter is entitled to succeed, according to the decided cases, to her father's estate even if she be unchaste at the time of his death (except in cases governed by the Dayabhāga ).1375 The reagon assigned is that Kāt, and other smrti writers do not expressly mention the requirement of chastity in the case of the daughter or mother as they do as regards the widow. According to the 1376 Dayabhaga (XI. 2. 8) Bp. declares : 'a daughter equal in caste to the father and married to a husband of the same caste as her own, who is virtuous and intent on serving her husband, inherits her father's property'. Therefore \#-daughter who is unchaste cannot inherit. Further a daughter Buoceeds not because she is the daughter, but because she satisfies all conditions laid down by Bș. The Dayabhāga ( XI. 2. 31 ) further says that the word 'wife' (in XI. 1. 56) is merely Illustrative and whatever restrictions are imposed on the wife apply to all women as heirs. The illegitimate daughter, even of a südra, has no right of inheritance to her father. 1377 

By virtue of local or family custom daughters have in some cases been held to be excluded from inheritance, 1378 . . It may be noted that in his Vaijayanti ( on Vişnu Dh. 8. XVII. 5-6) Nandapandita appears to have preferred a daughter in-law to a daughter; but he stands practically alone in this. Vide Jolly's T. L. L. p. 199 and p. 286 for quotation which however is not found in the D. O. Ms. No. 69 of the Vaijayanti. The daughter-in-law is not an heir at all in the whole of India,

Ascept in Bombay ( where she inherits, as the widow of a gotraja sapinda). The Balambhatti oritioizes Nandapandita without naming him and holds that a daughter-in-law inherits only as a 

otraja and not before a daughter. P... Raghunandana in his comment on the Dayabbāga makes the position about unchaste daughters quite clear 1379. The antis give preference among daughters to an unmarried daughter i. a. to a daughter who is a virgin ( kumāri). It has béon held by the Indian High Courts that though chastity is not required in the case of daughters to entitle them to inherit, yet in a competition between a married daughter and a daughter who was never married, but became a concubine or prostitute, the latter would be postponed to the former as the lātter is not a virgin though unmarried. Some emptis like Partsara 1300 employ the word kumāri in speaking of daughters' Buodession, while others employ the word 'kanya', but both words are synonymous. In Govind v. Bhiku 46 Bom. L. R. 699, where & man died leaving as heirs & married daughter and another daughter who never married, but was living as the permanent concubine of another man, it was held that the latter 'cannot inherit the property of her sonless father to the exclusion of or along with his married daughter. The old texts speak of only unmarried daughters and married daughters and prefer the former to the latter. Medhatithi on Manu IX. 132 says that kanya means a girl who has had no sexual intercourse with any man. The Mit, makes three classes of daughters suoceed one after another viz. (1) unmarried daughter, (2) indigent married daughter, (3) well-to-do married daughter. Judicial decisions have added a fourth yariety viz. unmarried daughter who has become a prostitute. This fourth olags being a new one must be pleoed after the other three classes expressly mentioned by the texte and commentaries on the basis of the maxim (intrudere of uninvited persons must be seated at the end of or after those

• The daughter's son ( dauhitra). On failure of daughters the daughter's son inherits. Gaut., Ap., Vas., are all silent about the daughter's son and so are Yaj. and Vişnu. But it has been plausibly urged by Visvarüpa that, since 1381 Yāj. himself has (in II. 134 ) stated that the illegitimate son of a südra takes the whole estate if there be no legitimate son provided there exista no heir up to the daughter's son, the latter must have been intended to be an heir by Yāj. taking after the daughters. The Madanapārijāta (p. 672) relies on the word 'oa' in Yaj. to bring in the daughter's son. Though the printed text of Vişnu Dh. 8. is silent about the daughter's son, the Mit., the Daya. bbāga and others quote a verse of Vişnu, 1382 ' when there is no continuance of lineage through sons and son's son the daughter's Bons take the wealth (of the deceased owner); in offering srāddha to the ancestora, daughter's sons are regarded as son's song'. The V. Mayükha (p. 142 ) includes a sūtra about the dauhitra in Vinnu Dh. S. Govindaraja, a commentator of Manu, is said by the Dāyabhaga, to have held, relying on this verse of Vişnu, that the daughter's son inherited tille estate even before a married daughter of the deceased. But the Dayabhāga did not approve of this view. The Diyabhāga (XI. 2. 27 ) notes that Balaka held that as the daughter's son was not expressly named by Yaj. he came in as an heir after all those that were expressly mentioned as heirs. Baud. Dh. 8.

should inherit the entire wealth of a sonless man, that he should offer one pinda to his father and another to the maternal grand. father and that in religious matters. there is no difference between a son's son and a daughter's son, since their father and mother (respectively) spring from the body of the deceased owner. The context and the wording of these verses show, as held by Kullūka and other commentators, that the daughter's son here referred to is the son of the appointed daughter. But Manu IX. 136 is somewhat clearer. It says, through a son born to a daughter from a husband of the same class, whether she be appointed ( as a son) or not, the maternal grand-father becomes one having a son's son; that son should offer pinda and take the wealth of the maternal grandfather'. The Mit. takes the word 'akrta' in this verse as referring to the ordi nary daughter, while Medhatithi and Kullūka hold that this Verse also only refers to the son of the putrika and that krt. means an appointed daughter with regard to whom an express agreement was made with her husband, while akstā means one (who is intended mentally to be appointed as a son) about whom there is no such express agreement. Bộ. (8. B. E. 33 p. 379 verse 58 ) provides : 'just as (the daughter ) gets ownership in her father's property (as an heir ), though įthere may be other relatives, so her son also becomes the owner of his mother's and maternal grand-father's property : 1384 

The daughter's sons inherit per capita and not per stirpes, Suppose that A has two daughters B and C, that B has three Bons and C has two sons, that then both B and C. die in A's Botime; on A's death his estate will be divided into five parts, 

each daughter's son taking one fifth. .' 

A daughter's son is really a bandhu and a bhinnagotra sapinda, but owing to historical causes and the high religious efficacy of the srāddha offered by him he has been given a very high place among heirs by express texts. 

Parents (pitarau). Great divergenoe prevails among medieval digesta on the position of the father and the mother as heirs to their son. Yaj gives no clue as to whiob among the parents is to be preterrad If both are allve when their son dies. The text of the

Father and mother as heirs

Vişnu Dh. 1385 S. as read by most digests places the father before the mother. Manu IX. 217 states that when the son dies issueless the mother takes his wealth, while Manu IX. 185 provides that the father takes the wealth of a sonless man and the brothers also. So Manu is not definite about the preference among parents. Kat. (927) observes, 1356 'of a sonless man (the heirs ) are declared to be the wife of good family, the daughters, the father on failure of them, the inother, the brother and the brother's) sons'. Br. (S. B. E. 33 p. 379 v. 63) says,1387 'when a son dies without leaving his own wife or male issue, his mother is to be considered as her son's heir or a brother may succeed with the consent of the mother'. In this conflict it may be stated that the Mit., the Madanapārijāta, S. V. (p. 416 ), the V.C., the V. P. prefer the mother to the father; while the Dayabhaga, the Sm. C., the Madanaratna, the V. Mayakha prefer the father to the mother. Srikara 1388 held that both parents, if alive, succeed together. But the Dayabhāga, Sm. C.

The वि. र. p. 595 and वि. चि. p. 151 reverse the order and read तदभावे मानुगामि तदभावे पितृगामि, But the व्य. प्र. p. 524 notes that such an order is found in no other work and so must be taken to be a mistake, Even the printed मिता. reads पितृगामि first. तस्मात्स्मृतिचन्द्रिका-मदनरत्नकार-कल्पतरु रस्ना. कर-पारिजातकारमभूतीनां बहूना पितुरभावे मातुः पुत्रधनाधिकार इत्येव सिद्धान्तः । पाच स्पतिमा त तदभावे मातृगामि तदभावे पितृगामि इति वृह द्विष्णुवचनं पठित्वा यथामिताक्षर मेव सिद्धान्तितम् । स कुत्रापि तदतिरिक्तग्रन्धे तथा पाठस्यालिखना भ्रान्तिविलसितमेव । ग्य. म. p. 524. It is, however, to be noted that in the printed वि. र. (p. 592) the father is placed after the mother (मातुरभावे पित्रादीनामधिकारस्य स्थितत्वात् ).

and others criticise this view. The reasons why the Mit. prefers the mother before the father are three, out of which two are based on grammar. The word 'pitarau ' in Yāj. is what is called an 'ekasesa' dvandra compound and in dissolving it or in the full-fledged dvandva the mother comes first in order and hence she should be preferred. Another reason is : 1389 A father may have several wives and song from them all, so that a mother is directly related to her own son only and not to the other sons of her husband. So ( the Mit, says ) the mother has greater nearness (prattyāsatti) to her son than the father has. The Sm. C. (II. p. 297) refers to Jai. V. 1. 14 where the Vedio sentencesārasvatau bhavataḥ' is interpreted and it is stated that the first oblation is offered to Sarasvati because the Yājyā and Anuvākyā verses as first set out are meant for Sarasvati (and not on the ground of the method in which the ekašeşa is dissolved); therefore as to pitarau also no reliance should be placed on the dissolution of the compound. Nilakantha in the V. Mayükha denies the assumptions based upon grammar, says that Pāṇ. does not direct that in dissolving the compound the word mātā must be employed first and there is no authority for doing so, 1390 But the V. P. says that though Pāṇini may 

1389. पिता सपत्नीपुत्रेष्यपि साधारणः । माता तु न साधारणीति प्रत्यासत्यति शयोस्तीति विमलम्भसशमिदं न हि जननीजनकयोर्जन्यं प्रति समिकर्षतारतम्यमस्ति । way. II, p. 297. 

1390. The general rule is that several words that would be in the same case when separately used may be compounded together to form a dvandva, when they are employed to convey the sense of 'ca', as said in 'carthe dvandvah' (Pān. II. 2. 297. Such a compound is called dvandva and mātā-pitarau is an example of it. Another sūtra (I. 2. 64) of Pāņini states that when words denoting several individuals of the same kind are to be compounded together, only one of them may be retained and that is called an ekašeşa compound, which is of two kinds, sarīpa (e. g. hamsasca hamsasca bansau) and virupa ( when the two words are of different genders). The latter kind of ekašesa is of restricted use. In such a compound when a male and female are asso ciated together only the word in the masculine gender remains or the word 

pits' when compounded with mātr (vide Pān. I. 2. 67 and 1. 2. 70). There fore we have two forms to denote the idea of parents viz. matapitarau or pitarau, Io dissolving this compound (pitarau ) we employ the phraseology mātā ca pitā сa and in the word 'nātāpitarau' the word for mother comes first. Therefore among parents as beirs mother should come first. Vide pp. 242-244 of my notes to the V. Mayükba (ed, of text) wbere both the Mit. passage and its criticism by the V. Mayūkha are explained at length. In Balkrishna v. Lakshman 14 Bom. 603 both the Mit. and Mayūkha's criticism thereof are set out (pp. 608-609).

Preference among parents

contain no such direction, all grammatical works like the Kašikā dissolve the compound as mātā ca pitā сa' and gram matical usage for centuries supports the argument that the word mātā, comes first 1391. The argument about the mother being nearer is quite specious. Looked at from the son (whose inheritance is in question), the mother and father are both equally proximate. The V. P. holds that according to the maxim that even a slight ground of difference leads one to determine (priority) the mother should be preferred to the father ( since we dissolve the compound as mātā ca pitā ca). The V. P. (p. 525) further tries to get over the text of Visnu (putting the father before the mother) by explaining that if the mother is most worthy as a pativratū and the father an ordinary man she should be preferred but if the father is more worthy than the mother he should be preferred. Hardly any one sup ports V. P, and the courts have not followed this. Owing to the difference of opinion among the digests on the question of the preference between parents as heirs, queer results follow. For example, in the province of Bombay itself the father is pre ferred as an heir to the mother in Gujerat, the island of Bombay and in Northern Konkan (because in these regions the V. Mayükha has been held to be of paramount authority ), while in the rest of the Bombay Presidency the mother is preferred to the father as an heir. The inother takes a limited interest as an heir which is the same as the interest taken by a widow as heir to her husband. The father would take an absolute inte rest. The word mother includes an adoptive mother; that is, if an adopted son dies leaving no son, widow, daughter or daughter's son, the adoptive mother would succeed 1392 to him as an heir (and even in preference to the adoptive father in those provinces where the Mit. is the supreme authority). In the case of a dvyāmugyāyana adoption, if the son adopted in that form dies leaving only his adoptive mother and natural mother, it has been held that both the mothers take his estate

as co-heiresses. 1333 It has further been held that if, after suc ceeding as adoptive mother to a dvyāmuşyāyana son, the adop tive mother again adopts a son, the latter does not deprive the natural mother of the half share taken by her as heir of the deceased dvyāmuṇyāyaṇa son. 

The word 'mother' in the Mit. does not include a step mother. The latter is not recognised as an heir of her step-son at all in the whole of India (except in Bombay) on account of the rule of the exclusion of women from inheritance 1394 except where texts expressly mention them as heirs and the property would go to the crown instead of to the step-mother, if the latter alone were left, but she would be entitled to maintenance. In Bombay the step-mother would inherit as the widow of a gotraja sapinda, but she is assigned a remote 1395 place among gotraja sapiņdas. If a widow remarries and then her son by her first husband dies without leaving a child, a widow, a daughter or daughter's son his remarried mother is allowed to inherit to him by the 1396 Boinbay High Court, though if she inherited first as a mother and then remarried, she is held by the same court to forfeit the inheritance taken (on account of section 2 of the Hindu Widows' Remarriage Act of 1856). 

The mother succeeding to her son takes only a limited estate i. e. she cannot alienate it except for legal necessity. If Vijñāneśvara's definition of stridhana be literally interpreted even property inherited from a son would be stridhana. There is a striking example in E. I vol. XIV p. 83 ( the Srirangam plates of Mummadi Nayaka in sake 1280) where a mother in heriting a village granted to her son Parāśarabhatta made a gift of it to the god Ranganātha at Srirangam.

Brothers and their sons as heirs 

725 

Brothers (bhrataraḥ) and brother's sons. Acc. to both Yāj. and Vişnu, on failure of the parents the brothers succeed and on failure of brothers, brother's sons inherit. There were appa rently conflicting texts, Sankha, Manu (IX. 185) and others giving the inheritance to the brothers even before the parents. All these are somehow reconciled and almost all digests from the Mit. downwards are agreed that brothers inherit after the parents. But again a conflict of views ensues. The Mit. says that among brothers, those of full blood inherit in preference to half brothers ( i. e. sons of the same father but sprung from a different mother). It then says that on failure of both kinds of brothers, the inheritance goes to brother's sons; but even here the sons of full brothers are preferred to sons of half brothers. This view of the Mit. is shared by the Dāyabhaga and almost all eininent writers of digests except the author of the V. Mayükha. The Mit. prefers the full brother to the half brother on the ground that the full brother has particles of the bodies of both the father and the mother of the deceased, while the half brother has only the particles of the father's body (the mother being different). Therefore the full brother is nearer than the half brother. The Dāyabhāga argues 139 that the full brother offers pindas to the same three paternal ancestors and the same three maternal ancestors to whom the deceased was bound to offer piņdas and is to be preferred to the half brother who offers piņdas to the three paternal ancestors of the deceased alone (but not to the maternal ancestors of the deceased). This view of spiritual benefit being the governing principle in pre ferring the full brother to the half brother is accepted by Aparārka (p. 745 ), 1398 The reasons of the V. Mayükha for pre ferring even the full brother's son to the half brother are: the word 'brothers' principally stands for 'brothers of the whole blood' (sodara) and only secondarily for brothers of the half blood. The general rule of Mimārsā 1399 is that the game word is

not to be understood in the same sentence or rule as used in the primary and also in the secondary sense. Just as the word 'mother applies only to the natural mother (and not to the step-mother), so bhrātaraḥ should not include both full and half brothers. The V. Mayükha is however wrong. As pointed out by the Dāyabhāga, when Yaj. wants to speak of the full brother he employs the words sodara' (Yāj. II. 138) and when he wants to refer to the half brother he employs the word 'anyodarya' or 'anyamütrja' (Yaj. II. 139). Therefore the word 'bbrātarah' applies to both full and half brothers in the primary sense. There are other smsti texts such as that of the Smộti-sangraha stating that brothers are of two kinds viz. those of full blood and those of half blood. 1400 

The Sm, 1401 C. II. 300 refutes the view of some that the word 'bhrātaraḥ' in Yāj. is an ekašeşa dvandva compound that it means 'brothers and sisters' according to Pān. I. 2. 68' ( bhrāts-putrau svass-duhitsbhyām) and that on failure of brothers sisters inherit. The V. Mayūkha 1402 also does not accept this interpretation of 'bhratarah' advanced by some, since there is no reason why 'bhrātaraḥ' should be taken as an ekašeşa of the virūpa kind ( which is restricted only to rare cases) and not of the sarūpa kind. The Balambhatti supports the wider interpretation of " bhrātarah' and at one time the Bombay High Court was inclined to accept this

interpretation. 1403 The above shows that some at least of the medieval and later Hindu jurists were more sympathetic and well disposed to the enlargement of the rights of women, though their views, failed to sooure general acceptance. It has been held that brothers by the same father (though by different mothers) are preferred to brothers by the same mother (though by different fathers ), it being pointed out that "there is no provision in the Mitakşarā or elsewhere for the sons born of the same mother after her remarriage being treated as brothers of the same womb for the purpose of inheritance so as to be included in the meaning of the word 'bhrātarah' used in the texts."1404 But Nandapandita expressly provides in his Vaijayanti the following order of succession among brothers and sisters of the whole and of the half blood: (1) brothers of the whole blood, (2) sisters of the whole blood, (3) brothers who are sons of the same father, (4) brothers who are sons of the same motber (vide Jolly T. L. L. pp. 208 and 287). Because Manu IX. 217 says that the wealth of a childless man is taken by the mother and that if the mother be dead, the father's mother would take it, the Sm. C. II. p. 299 places the paternal grand mother before the brothers, but it stands almost alone in this and the Mit. observes 1405 that Manu does not lay down the order but only provides that the paternal grand-mother is an heir capable of inheriting. The V. P. (p. 527) expresses its dissatisfaction with this method of the Mit. whereby only Yāj. and Vişnu are deemed to lay down the order in which heirs

take, while Manu, Sankha and others are deemed to be only concerned with declaring the right of certain persons to inherit. 

The V. Mayükha proposes a special order of inheritance as follows :-(1) full brothers; (2) then full brother's sons ; (3) the gotraja sapiņdas of whom the first is the paternal grand mother, (4) then the sister, (5) then the paternal grandfather and the half brother at the same time, (6) then the paternal great-grandfather, paternal uncle and the half brother's son together. It should be noted that this conjoint inheritance by heirs of different degrees of ascent and descent which is peculiar to the Mayukha has been regarded by the Bombay High Court as unknown in practice and obsolete. 1406 Therefore it is probable that even in districts governed by the Mayukha the order of heirs after the paternal grandmother and full sister would be half brother, then half sister and then half brother's son and then it will be the same both according to the Mit. and the Mayūkha, 

The Mit, does not expressly mention the sister at all but the Bombay High Court has held her to be a very near heir even where the Mit. is paramount, placing her after the brothers (whether full or half ), brother's sons (whether of the whole blood or half blood ) and paternal grandmother, the difference from the Mayūkha being that under the latter the full sister comes only after the full brothers and full brother's sons and paternal grandmother and before half brothers and half brother's sons. 

One passage of the Mayükha, being wrongly translated by Borradaile, has led the courts (including the P. C.) to decide that full brothers succeed along with the sons of a deceased full brother wherever the Mayūkba is supreme. The passage of the Mayukha as translated by Borradaile (vide Stokes H. L. Books p. 88, IV. 8. 17) runs "the sons of a brother also, if themselves fatherless, at the time of the paternal uncle's death, provided they are capable of understanding (the use of) property, will divide the father's share with their father's other brothers, after the example among grandsons by different fathers, the allotment of shares jg according to the fathers'".

Misunderstood Mayükha passage 

729 

The text of the Mayūkha is given in the note below. It is 1407 almost the same as a passage of the Mitākşarā, which has not been misunderstood. Both passages contemplate a case like this. A dies leaving B, C, D, his brothers, as his nearest heirs, 80 that A's estate vests in interest in B, C, D. Before the estate of A is actually divided by metes and bounds, B dies leaving three sons E, F, G. The last three had no right to the property of A at their uncle A's death because their father B was living at the time (i. e. pitvyamaranakāle jivatpitskataya asanjata-dlanasambandhāh). Yet when the property is later on actually to be divided they ( E, F, G) will take the share which their father B would have taken if the property of A had been divided at the moment of A's death. Here a distinction is drawn between vesting of property (dhanasambandha) and its actual partition. But, in order to entitle nephews to take by actual partition, their father should have survived the deceased. 

This is the real meaning, 

The Privy 1408 Council, following a wrong translation, held that, under the law of the V. Mayūkha, brothers and the sons

It may be true to some extent as a general proposition that commentators and digest writers embody pre-existing customs of the districts where they wrote. But often times this is not so and varying statements of the law are due to individual opinions.

of a brother that died before the propositus ( the brother inherit ance to whom is in question) shared the estate of the latter. This erroneous decision has been persisted in to this day on the principle of stare decisis. The view of the Vaijayanti about the sons of the same woman from different husbands being sapindas of each other has already been noted (p. 727). Govindarāja on Manu DIL 11 says that it is wellknown that children of different fathers but of the same mother are spoken of as brother and sister. Kullüka on Manu III. 11 refers to this view of Govindarāja. 1409 

A question arises whether the distinction between full blood and half blood made by the Mit, in the case of brothers and nephews was to be carried beyond them. Though a Full Bench 1410 of the Bombay High Court held that the dis tinction was not to be carried beyond brothers and nephews. and that paternal uncles of the half blood inherited along with paternal uncles of the full blood, the Privy Council over ruled this decision and held that the preference of the whole blood to the half blood extends to all sapiņdas of the same degree from the common ancestor (and therefore a paternal uncle of the whole blood excludes one of the half blood ). The Madanapārijāta 1411 p. 674 expressly extends the preference of the whole blood to paternal wholes,

places the mother before the father ( folios 139-140). Following this case it was held in Haridas v. Ranchordas 5 Bom. L. R, 516 that the son of a predeceased brother inherited along with the brothers of the deceased. This rule is not to be carried beyond brothers and brothers' sons. In Kesarial o. Jagubhai 49 Bom. 282 the differring translations of the Mayukha were referred to (at. p. 286), it was held that the principle of stare decisis required that the Privy Council decision should be followed and the estate of a deceased brother was allowed to devolve on the sons of a brother that had died before the deceased along with the surviviog brother.

Compact series of heirs 

731 

It is noteworthy that the Viramitrodaya which generally follows the Mit. invokes the principle of spiritual benefit in preferring the full brother's son to the half brother's son. 1412 

The heirs from the wife to the brother's Bons are spoken of as 'baddhakrama' (lit. whose order is fixed) in the Mit., the V. Mayūkha (p. 143 ) and other works and as 'the compact series (of heirs )' in the case law. For example, in rejecting the view of some that rely on Manu IX, 217 that the father's mother succeeds immediately after the mother, it is said that the heirs from the parents to the brother's son being mentioned in a fixed order (by Yāj.), no place can be found for the father's inother in the fixed series of heirs and that Manu IX. 187 indicates only this that the father's mother is an heir. 1413 The V. Mayūkha relies on the popular maxim that when certain persons are specially invited for a meeting or a dinner they are seated on seats definitely allotted to them but that those who come uninvited are assigned places at the end of the row of those who were specially invited. 1414 

The question ariges whether the brother's son's son inherits immediately after the brother's son and before any other heir. There is a conflict among Sanskrit writers on this point. The Sm. C. II. p. 300, 1415 the Subodhins, the Madanapārijāta (p. 673) say that the compact series ends with the brother's son, while Aparārka, Varadarāja (V. Nir, p. 453 ) and the Vaijayanti of Nandapandita hold that the brother's son's son comes immediate

ly after the brother's son. A Full Bench of the 1416 Bombay High Court holds, basing its decision on the usage of the province, that the compact series ends with the brother's son, while the Privy Council would seem to lend colour to the view that in the Benares school it ends with the brother's son's son. The Dayabhāga (XI. 6.6 p. 208) places the brother's son's son immediately after the brother's son on the ground of the superior efficacy of the pipdas offered by him. 

Gotrajas (lit. 'those born in the same gotra' or agnates ). Yaj. says that on failure of the heirs up to brother's song the gotrajas succeed. Though one's father, brothers and brother's Bons also are really gotrajas, they are expressly assigned cer tain fixed places in the order of heirs and other persons born in the gotra are included in the term gotrajas on the analogy of such an example as 'let the cattle be brought and also the bulls' where the bulls, though really included under 'cattle (gāvaḥ), are separately mentioned in order to emphasize that special attention must be paid to them on account of their in tractable nature. Vide p. 526 note 966 above, Acc. to the Mit. gotrajas are the father's mother ( as the first among them ), then other gapiņdas and samānodakas. The V. Mayükha (p. 143 ) also says the same thing and places the father's mother as the first among gotraja sapiņdas. It may be remarked that Yāj. avoids the word sapiņda and employs the word gotraja. The Mit. and Mayūkha state that sapiņdas succeed as heirs and that sapiņdas are of two kinds, viz. gotrajas ( born in or having the same gotra as the propositus ) and those that are born in (or are of) a different gotra. These latter (viz. bhinnagotra sapindas ) are designated as bandhus by Yaj. Therefore it comes to this that, though Yaj. does not employ the word sapinda, the inheri tance goes after the brother's son to the nearest sapinda. Yāj. knew the word 'sapiņda' (I 52) and defines the limits of sapiņda relationship for marriage (in I. 53), from which it follows that he does not use the word sapiņda in the senge given to the word by Jimõtavāhana. In I. 68 Yaj. mentions both sapiņda and sagotra (in the matter of niyoga ) and thereby indi cates two things viz. that the words were not synonymous and that sagotra had the same sense as gotraja. 

1416. Vide Appaji v. Mohanlal 54 Bom 564 (F. B.), in which Buddha Singh v. Laltu Singh L. R, 42 I. A, 208 was distinguished on the ground that it was not an express decision on the question whether the. compact series of heirs ended with the brother's son.

Meaning of sapinda in Mann 

733 

Ap. Dh. S. II. 6, 14, % provides 1417 that'on failure of sons the nearest sapinda'(inherits). Manu 1418 IX. 187 is the classi cal text on this point, which appears to mean literally, 'whoever is nearest from among the sapindas, to him the estate (of the deceased) shall belong'. This verse has been variously ex plained by the commentators and digests and variously trans lated by eminent Judges and writers on Hindu Law. The chief difficulty lies in the expression sapiņdādyah' and the words tasya tasya'. Some take the first as equal to two words 

sapiņdāt yah' and others as one word 'gapiņdadyaḥ' (sapiņda and the like). Some take one ' tasya' (of him) as referring to the deceased and the other to the inheritor; while others take * tasya tasya' as both referring to the inheritor alone, corres ponding to'yaḥ' (one more 'yaḥ' being suppressed for the sake of metre). Though the printed text and most of the commen taries read the half verge of Manu as in the note below there are several digests that read it differently. For example, the Sm. O. II. p. 301 reads it as 'yo yo hyanantaraḥ piņdāt' and quotes Dhāreśyara's explanation that 'piņdāt' means 'sapiņdāt'. Kullūka and the Dāyatattva p. 195 explain 'sapiņdāt' as * sapindamadhyāt' (from among sapiņdas ) and this appears to be the best explanation. Br. 1419 (S. B. E. 33 p. 379 verge 62 )

Bühler is not right when he emphatically says: "On philological grounds it seems to me improbable that 'anantaraḥ sapiņdāt' can mean anything else than 'nearest to the sapinda 'and that this sapiņda can be anybody else than the deceased". In the first place the singular sapiņdāt' can be easily interpreted as used in a generic sense (jātāvekavacanam) i, e, as meaning 'sapiņdebhyaḥ' (from among sapiņdas). In Ap., Br, and other works wherever inheritance is spoken of, it is the inheritor who is required to be the sapinda or bandhava or sakulya and the deceased is hardly anywhere spoken of as the sapinda of the in heritor but rather "as 'mrta', 'svaryāta ', dbanin' &c.

says, 'when there are several agnates, sakulyas and bandhairs (cognates ), whosoever of them is the nearest shall take the wealth of him that dies without issue', 

The important question is: what is the meaning of the word 'sapiņda'. The Mitākşarā and the Dayabhāga propound two different meanings of the word that have been explained at length in H. of Dh. vol. II, pp. 452-458 and 472-477. Therefore it is not necessary to repeat those explanations. The word 

sapinda ' is employed by Pāņini (IV. 1. 165) in connection with the technical definition of gotra (Pān. IV. 1. 162 ) given by him. It appears to have been used in the sense of blood rela tionship as stated by the Kāsikā. According to the Mit, the right to inheritance depends upon blood relationship ( connec tion through particles of the same body, ekaśarīrūvayavānvaya) and the preference among those who are blood relations is deter muined by nearness or propinquity (pratyāsatti). According to the Dāyabhāga, sapinda relationships is based on religious efficacy i. e, on the capacity to offer the cake or ball of rice in grāddha and it has evolved a peculiar method of determining preference which will be explained immediately below. That there appears to have been a close connection between taking the woalth of the deceased and offering śrāddha to him may be admitted. But the question is whether a person was deemed to be an heir and entitled to take the estate of the decoased because he offered śrāddha to that person or whether the heirship was originally determined on other grounds and whoever took the estate was saddled with the responsibility of performing śrāddhas for the benefit of the soul of the deceased. It is difficult to give a convincing answer to this. It appears, however, that ancient sūtras do not emphasize the religious efficacy of pindas as the determining principle in heirship. Ap., Manu, Br. (particular ly the first and last ) speak only of nearness (which more naturally means 'nearness of blood '). Yaj. omits the word sapiņda altogether in mentioning heirs. Manu IX. 142 states that pipda follows the gotra and riktha (wealth). Vispu Dh. 8. XV.40 declares,' whoever inherits the estate (of the deceased) has to offer piņda to him'. This rule is emphasized even by those works (like V. Mayūkha) 1420 that make blood relationship

the test of heirship by saying that whoever even including the king (who takes by escheat on failure of all heirs ) that takes the estate of the deceased must perform or arrange for the performance of the funeral ceremonies of the deceased up to 10 days after death and the śrāddhas, as said by the Braluna purāņa 220. 79 (tadabhāve ca nrpatih kārayettvakutunbināmi tajjātiyair-naraiḥ samyak-dāhādyāḥ sakalāh kriyāḥ ). The Mit. view is upheld by V. R., V. C., Par. M., Madanapārijāta, Saras. vativilāga, V. Mayükha, Bālambhaçți and many other works. The theory of the Dayabhāga is propounded by only a few medieval works and writers like Aparārka (quoted above on p. 725), Raghunandana, Nanda pandita. The Viramitrodaya generally follows the Mit, but in certain cases it relies on or refers to the principle of religious efficaoy in preferring one heir to another, as for example, in preferring the full brother to the step-brother (compare note 1397 and V. P. p. 528) or in preferring tlırce male descendants to the widow. It is therefore that the Privy Council remark, 1421 'now it is absolutely clear that under the Mitā kşarā while the right of inheritance arises from blood relationship or community of blood, in judging of the nearness of blood relation ship or propinquity among the gotrajas the test to be applied to discover the preferential heir is the capacity to offer "oblations'. Its position is peculiar. 1422 It says that the capacity to offer piņdas is not the governing principle as to heirship, but it is only useful in finding out the preferential heir among gotrajax. 

Vişnu quoted by the Mit. (not found in the printed Dharmasūtra) prescribes : 'If there be no son or grandson left for continuing the line, the daughter's sons shall take the wealth, for in regard to the obsequies of ancestors daughter's sons are regarded as son's sons'. This is in line with Manu IX. 136 ( cited above on p. 720 ) which says that the daughter's son should offer the pinda and take the wealth. Therofore it appears that Manu, Vişnu and others relied upon the capacity for the offering of pinda as the reason for being entitled as heir, but that this idea was vague and not elaborated in any way. The idea that blood relationship settled the right to inheritance is implicit in the order of heirs in Yāj. Yaj. ( II. 127 ) in speaking of the kşetraja son says that he inherite the wealth of both ( the

begetter and the husband of the wife on whom he is begotten) and offers pinda to both, He does not state that because he offers pinda to both he inherits the wealth. So this verse also favours the view that offering of pinda was a duty laid up on him who took the wealth (except in the case of male issue ). Hence it appears that the theory of the Mit. also has a very respectable antiquity and further it has been followed by most medieval writers throughout India ( except in Bengal). 

The argument of the Dayabhāga ( which was propounded before it by a writer probably named Udyota 1423) that the taking of a deceased person's estate depends upon the spiritual benefit conferred on him is briefly as follows. It relies princip ally on Baud. Dh, S. and Mapu. In the section on the partition of wealth ( which begins from IX. 103 ) Manu (IX. 137) declares the super-eminent spiritual benefits conferred by the son, grandson and great-grandson; further (in IX. 106 ) Manu states that the son gets all wealth from his father because he frees the latter from debt, that ( in IX. 139 ) the daughter's son also is spoken of as saying the grandfather in the next world and as therefore entitled to the grandfather's wealth, that the verse immediately preceding Manu IX. 187 ( declaring that the nearest amongst sapiņdas inherits ) speaks of the offering of piņda to three ancestors; and since it is reasonable to prosume that the blind and the like are excluded from inheritance (Manu IX. 201 ) because they are incapable of performing religious rites, it follows that Manu and others regarded the taking of wealth as dependent on the conferring of spiritual benefit. This point of view the Dayabhāga emphasizes at every step. It 1424 says: "There are two purposes for which wealth is acquired, viz. for worldly enjoyment and for the unseen or spiritual benefit derived from making gifts and the like ; but when the acquirer is dead, he cannot have enjoyment of the wealth and the only purpose that remains is the unseen purpose or benefit. It is therefore that Br. says, 'from the wealth inherited, the inheritor should carefully set apart half for the benefit of the deceased for defraying the expenses of the

monthly, six-monthly and annual srāddhas". The subject of Grāddhas will be dealt with in another volume. But here it is necessary to say a few words for making the position of the Dayabhāga clear. Among the several kinds of sraddhas two deserve notice, viz. Ekoddişta and Pārvana. 1425 The first (ekoddi şta ) is performed for the benefit of a single deceased person. There are sixteen such śrāddhas performed for the benefit of the deceased during the course of one year after his death or on the 11th day of death. And every year on the anniversary of death an ekoddista śrāddha may be performed for a deceased person. The pārvaņa śrāddha is performed on certain specified days, such as the amāvāsyā of a month, or particularly in the dark half or on the amāvāsyā of Bhadrapada or on a sankrānti. In this srāddha the three deceased paternal ancestors of the performer are principally invoked and the three deceased paternal ancestors of his mother are also invoked but their invocation is secondary and is dependent on the principal invocation. There is one more word that must be explained here viz. sapindana or sapindikarana. This is a grāddha rite performed one year after the death of a person or on the 12th day from his death. By this grāddha the person recently deceased ceases to be a preta ( a departed spirit) and is elevated to the rank of pitss (Manes). The widow and daughter can perform only the ekoddista śrāddha, while sons, grandsong and great-grandsons can perform the pārvaņa śrāddha also. The Dayabhāga refers ( XI. 1. 34 p. 162 ) to the fact that the three male descendants, by performing the pārvana-sraddha, confer great spiritual benefit on the owner (compare note 1342 above ). Elsewhere ( XI. 7. 17 p. 211) it designates the paryaņa as 'traipuruşika'(i. e. performed for the benefit of three ancestors). When speaking of the right of the widow to inherit it empha. sizes ( XI. 1. 43 p. 165 ), by quoting verses from Vyāsa, 1426 that

a widow by leading a chaste life, by offering water mixed with sesame every day to her deceased husband, by making gifts and observing fasts saves himself and her husband in the next world. It adds that if the widow misbehaves she makes her husband fall, as husband and wife share in the fruits of each other's good and evil deeds. Therefore the widow takes her husband's wealth for his benefit. Bphan-Manu (4. by the Dayabhaga XI. 1. 7 and by the Mit. ) declares that a sonless chaste widow should offer pinda to her husband and take his entire estate. Similarly Prajapati (cited above on p. 709 and quoted by even the V. Mayükha and other works of the Mitakşarā school) requires the widow who inherits all the movable and im. movable property of her deceased husband to perform the monthly, six-monthly and annual srāddhas of her husband. 1427 Similarly the Dayabhāga allows the unmarried daughter or a married daughter having a son (or who is likely to have a son) to inherit because her son will offer pinda to the owner who will be the maternal grand-father. It prefers the daughter's son 1428 as an heir even to the father because the former offers a pinda to the owner himself, while the father offers pindas to two of the three paternal ancestors to whom the owner would have been bound to offer piņdas. The D. B. winds up by saying 1439 that the order of inheritors must be followed in such a way that the wealth of the deceased may be most beneficial to the soul of) the deceased. In certain respects the D. B. does not strictly and logically follow its own theory but is compelled to twist it by reason of the places assigned by special

The order of heirs and graddhadhikārins

texts to certain heirs. 1430 For example, the order of heirs according to the D. B. is ; son, grandson and great grandson ; widow ; daughter; daughter's son: father; mother; full brother ; half brother; full brother's son; half brother's son. But the persons entitled to perform the śrāddha of the deceased in order are somewhat different. In fact the order of sucoession does not strictly follow in any school the order of those that are called srāddhādhilārins. The order of those who are entitled to offer śrāddha to a deceased separated male ( śrāddhūdhikārin) given in most works is as followe; son ( aurasa or adopted ); grand son; great-grandson; widow; married daughter; unmarried daughter who has succeeded to the doceased's wealth; daughter's son who succeeds to the wealth; full brother; half brother (son of a different mother); full brother's son; half brother's son; father ; mother; daughter-in-law; full sister; half sister; full sister's son; half sister's son; paternal uncle; paternal uncle's son; other gotraja sapindas ; sodaka; any gotraja ; cognates such as maternal grandfather, maternal uncle, maternal uncle's son (i. e. the bandhus of the three kinds in order); pupil; son-in-law ; father-in-law; friend; any brāhmaṇa who takes a brahmana's wealth or king who takes by escheat. Vide Nirnayasindhu III uttarardha pp.382-386, Dharmasindhu III uttarardha pp. 368,369, Sraddhaviveka p. 48. If the principle of the capacity to offer or of the offering of pindas regulating the right to succeed is to be strictly and logically followed, there is no reason why the mother or the paternal grandmother should succeed immediate ly after the father or the paternal grandfather respectively. Her recognition in the D. B. school is due to the fact she is expressly mentioned in Manu as an heir. Similarly in the rules about the succession to re-united copardeners, the school of D. B. gives preference to re-united co-parcenors and does not apply the theory of spiritual benefit. Further the Dāyatattva says that all that is required is the capacity 

1430. Vide Akshaya Chandra v. Haridas 35 Cal. 721 at p. 726 and Nalinaksha v. Rajanikanta 58 Cal. 1392 for the propositions that the doctrina of spiritual benefit cannot be applied consistently in all cases such as the succession of females to males, the succession of samanodakas &c. and that in cases not contemplated by Jimūtavābana or his followers in the Bengal school, the principle of propiaquity and of natural love and affection should be followed. The Dāyatattva p. 195 after quoting Br. cited above observes that both the superiority of pindas offered and nearness of line are to be considered la inheritance, 'foregrappear EPATUTT तम्पेन च धनेपधिकारी,

to receive pinda or the capacity to participate in the pipdas offered by others and not the actual offering of pindas. For example, if a man performs śrāddha for his ancestors, then dies, but no one performs his sapipdana and therefore he does not participate in the pindas given to his ancestors, still his wealth will be inherited on the principle of religious efficacy. 1431 Owing to considerations of space it is not possible to go into great detail about the several proposi tions established in relation to the theory of religious benefit as the determining factor in matters of inheritance. But the following propositions may be set out in one place: 

(1) Benefits are conferred on the deceased by means of the ekoddişta or the pārvanu śrāddha. The capacity to perform the pārvana śrāddha is not the sole ground on which rests the right to inheritance to a man. Therefore the widow, the daughter and the pupil were recognized as heirs though they perform only the ekoddista śrāddha. But those who are competent to perferm the pārvana śrāddha have a preferable claim to those who are entitled to perform only the ekoddişta śrāddha. There fore the male issue of a deceased person are preferred to a widow or daughter. 

(2) Spiritual benefit is conferred on a man by presenting piņda directly to him or by offering pinda to one or more of his paternal ancestors to whom he presents piņdas during his own life time and with whom he participates in pindas offered after his death by others or by offering a pinda to one or more of his maternal ancestors ( mother's father, mother's father's father and the latter's father) to whom he was bound to offer pindas during his life (but with whom he does not participate in the piņda offered to them 1432 ). 

(3) The pinda offered to a man himself directly is of greater efficacy than the piņda offered to a paternal ancestor in which he participates after his own death as one of the Manos. There fore the son, grandson or great-grandson is preferred to every one else. The brother offers a piņda to the father and two more

paternal ancestors of the deceased in which he (the deceased owner) only participates after his death. Therefore the brother is postponed to the son or daughter's son (who offers a pinda directly to the deceased himself as his maternal grandfather). 

(4) The pindas offered to paternal anoestors have greater efficacy than those offered to maternal ancestors (hence a brother's son is preferred to a sister's son because the former offers pindas to his own and the owner's paternal anoestors, while the latter offers piņdas to his maternal ancestors who are the paternal ancestors of the owner). 

(5) The pinda offered to the owner's father is of greater efficacy than that offered to the paternal grandfather or great grandfather. Therefore a brother's son or grandson is preferred to a paternal uncle. 1433 Hence it should follow that all agnatic and cognatio descendants of the father of the deceased would be preferred to any descendant of the paternal grandfather or great. grandfather. 

(6) Where the number of pindas offered by two claimants is the same, he who offers a pinda to the nearer ancestor is to be preferred. 

The Dayabhāga, strarting with Baud, Dh. S. (I, 5. 113 ff), Manu (IX. 186-187) and the Matsyapurāpa elaborates its own definition in the following 1434 way. A man's son and a daughter are both born in the family. The daughter's son springs from the family of his maternal grandfather but he belongs to another gotra (viz, his own father's gotra); similarly, a man's sister (i. e. father's daughter) is born in his family but her son, though mediately sprung from the deceased owner's family, belongs to another gotra (viz. that of the sister's husband ): the same is true of a father's sister's son and the paternal grand father's sister's son. A sister's son offers a pinda to the father

of the deceased, as the owner's father is the former's maternal grandfather and therefore he is connected as sapiņda with the owner. A father's sister's son offers a piņda to the paternal grand father of the owner, who ( paternal grandfather ) is the maternal grandfather of the father's sister's son. A maternal uncle is not sprung even mediately from the family of the owner, but he offers a piņda to his own father who is the maternal grandfather of the deceased owner. Therefore the maternal uncle or his son or son's son being connected with a pinda that is offered to the maternal grandfather or maternal great-grandfather respectively of the deceased owner is a sapiada of the deceased owner. A maternal aunt's son also offers a piņda to his mother's father, who is also the owner's mother's father and so the maternal aunt's son is a sapiņda of the owner. The pindas offered to the maternal ancestors by him are inferior and secondary. Further, one's own mother, the father's mother, father's father's inother were associated with their respective husbands as to the pindas offered to the male ancestors and the same holds good about the wives of the maternal ancestors also. 1435 

The result of this way of defining a sapiņda is to obliterate the distinction between a gotraja and a bundhu. Yāj. ( 11. 136 ) expressly says that a bandhu can suoceed only on failure of all gotrajas and so according to him a bandhu is one who is not a gotraja. The Dāyabhāga brings in the sister's son immediately after the the brother's son's son and before the paternal grand father (i, e. even before a near agnatio ancestor ) who is literally a gotraja, while the sister's son is literally not a gotraja. When the Dayabhaga designates one's sister's son as sprung from the kula of the owner though not of the same gotra, he does violence to popular usage prevalent throughout India. An ordinary person in India hardly ever says that his sister's son or father's sister's son is born in his own kula. The Dayabhāga only quibbles over the word 'gotraja' in Yaj. which it reads in the singular (gotrajab) and not in the plural (gotrajāḥ) as the Mit. does. Under the Mit. the sister's son is only a bandhu and cannot succeed before & paternal uncle or his son or a paternal grand-uncle or any other gotraja. The Dayabhāga thus gives the go-by to the text of Yāj. and shuffles in several

cognates as very near heirs. The D. B. regards Manu IX. 186– 187 as the crucial text and Yāj. 11. 135-36 as only secondary. 

The following diagrams will illustrate the working of the theory of religious efficacy. A person is a sapiņda of those to whom he is bound to offer a pinda while he is alive, of those who on his death are bound to offer pinda to him (viz. his three male descendants, his daughter's son, his son's daughter's son and his son's son's daughter's son) and of those who are bound to offer a piņda to the ancestors to whom he is bound to offer a pinda viz. to his three paternal ancestors and his three maternal ancestors and all of these are his sapiņdas. The last of these three groups has four sub-groups :--sub-group No. 1 comprises those who offer piņdas to their own paternal ancestors who are also the paternal ancestors of the owner: sub-group II contains those who offer pindas to their three maternal ancestors who are all or some of them the paternal ancestors of the owner, to whom he was bound to offer a pipda; sub-group II comprises those who offer piņdas to their paternal ancestors all or some of whom are the maternal ancestors of the owner; sub-group IV exhibits those who offer pindas to their own maternal ancestors who are also the maternal ancestors of the owner. Each of these sub-groups contains 9 persons (as the minimum ) who are all shown in thick type. If the owner has several brothers, sisters, uncles and aunts &c. the number of possible sapindas will be much larger. All heirs in the three sub-groups II-IV will be bandhus according to the Mitaksarā and will be post poned to gotrajas under the Mitakşarā. It should be noticed that Jimütavābana brought in the father's daughter's son immediately after the father's great-grandson, the paternal grandfather's daughter's son after the paternal grandfather's great-grandson and the paternal great-grandfather's daughter's son immediately after that ancestor's great-grandson on the analogy of the rights of the owner's daughter's son and on the basis of Manu IX. 139 that the dauhitra ( daughter's gon)-saves an ancestor in the next world just as a son's son does. 1436

those that are expressly named as heirs by special texts ), since they are not born or (even mediately ) sprung from the family of the owner, as the sister's son or the father's sister's bon that is held by it to be so sprung, that the word "bandhu' is employed by Yāj. to include a maternal uncle and the like among heritable sapiņdas, since they are not sprung even mediately from the kula of the owner and are also not of the same gotra, that the maternal unole and the like come in only after all descendants in the lines of the paternal ancestors inclusive of the great-grandfather up to the latter's daughter's son are exhausted, 1438 and that Manu had not to enter into these details as its two verses (IX. 186-187) were quite enough to lead to all that has been elaborated by the D. B. about the working of the theory of religious efficacy. 

It will have been noticed that no female except the five expressly mentioned can inherit under the Dāyabhāga scheme and the result is that a man's own son's daughter or daughter's daughter does not take as heir, whereas a distant:relative like the father's father's sister's son takes it. The same is also the case even under the Mitākşarī in the whole of India (except in Bombay and to some extent in Madras for which see a little later on). 

A man offers only the leayings or remnants of the piņdas that stick to his hand ( when offering piņdas to his three paternal ancestors) and that ( leavings) are cast on kusa grass to three paternal ancestors above the paternal great-grandfather (Manu III. 216). So also the three male descendants beyond the great-grandson offer the leavings (called pindalepa ) to the owner; these three remote paternal ancestors and the three remote malo descendants (spoken of as vibhaktadāyāda in Baud. Dh. $. I. 5. 114) are designated sakulya by Baud., and 

1438. Vide Kailasha Chandra v. Karuna Nath 18 C. W. N. 477 where the above passages are considered at length and it is held that the paternal grand-uncle's daughter's son (though pot expressly mentioned by the D. B.) is entitled to preference over the waternal uncle (who is ex pressly mentioned as an heir and a sapiņda by D. B.), since the former offers a pipda to the paternal great-grandfatber of the owner to whom the owner was bound to offer a pinda in which the owner participates after his owa death, while the latter offers a piada to the maternal grandfather of the owner to whom the owner was bound to offer a pinda in which, however, the owner did not participate after his death.

Meaning of sakulya 

747 

the D. B.1439 (XI. 1. 38). According to D. B. sakulyas succeed after all sapipdas are exhausted. Just as a man participates after his death in the pindas offered to his paternal ancestors 80 he would participate in the leavings also offered to his paternal ancestors from the 4th to 6th by their descendants (from 4th to 6th). The D. B. remarks that this difference between sapiņdas and sakulyas is made only in the matter of inheritance. But in the matter of the periods of mourning both the sapiņdas ( strictly so called in the section on inherit ance ) and the sakulyas are designated sapipdas by Manu (V. 60) and by the Markandeya-purana ( 28. 4).1440 According to Manu IX. 187 salculyas succeed on failure of sapindas, while Vişnu Dh. 8. ( XVII. 9-11) prescribes 1441 that on failure of bandhus, sakulyas succeed. It appears that Vişnu employs the word bandhu in the sense of sapinda. Nar.(dayabhaga,51) states that on failure of daughters and sakulyas, bāndhavas and persons of the same caste succeed. Here it appears that sakulya and bandhava are employed in the sense of gotraja and bāndhava as done in Yaj. The Balambhatti says that gotraja and sakulya are synonymous. The Dāyabhāga appears to be some what inconsistent in its references to sakulyas. In XI. 6. 15 and 23 it includes samāpodakas among sakulyas, while in XI. 6. 21-22 it defines sakulya as stated above. The Mit, on the other hand comprehends the sakulyas of the D. B. (as defined in XI.6.21) under its gotraja sapindas.

History of Dharmatastra 

(Vol. 

The Mit. states that the gotrajns are the paternal grand mother, the sapiņdas and samānodakas of the deceased. It then proceeds to say that the paternal grandmother is the first among gotrajas, then comes paternal grandfather. It para phrases the word gotraja ( born in the gotra ) as samānagotra (having the same gotra ) and then proceeds, 'on failure of the father's line ( santāna) the heirs are the paternal grandmother, the paternal grandfather, the paternal uncles and their sons in order; on failure of the paternal grandfather's line the paternal great-grandmother, the paternal great-grandfather, his sons and son's sons inherit. In this manner must be understood the succession of sapindas belonging to the same gotra ( as the deceased) up to the 7th degree'. According to the Mit, sapiņda relationship extends up to the 7th degree ( reckoned from and inolusive of the owner). Therefore the owner's sapiņdas for purposes of inheritance according to the Mit. are the owner's (1) 6 male descendants in the male line, (2) 6 male ascendants in the male line and the wives of the first three of them (that are expressly so declared, viz. mother, paternal grandmother and paternal great-grandmother) and probably the wives of the next three also; (3) the six male descendants of each of his six male ascendants in the collateral male lines. Besides, a man's wife and daughter are treated as his sapiņdas and the daughter's son, though a bhinnagotra sapinda, is placed high among the gotraja sapiņda heirs. 

Even under the Mitākşard in the whole of India (except in the Bombay and Madras schools ), no wonien succeed as gotraja sapiņdas (except five expressly named and cited above on p. 713 ). In Bombay the sister (full or half) is brought in as a gotraja by the V. Mayükha ( though the Mitakşarā is entirely silent) and placed by it immediately after the paternal grandmother. It relies on the general words of Manu IX. 187 and of Bf. ( quoted above on p.733 ) that to the nearest person in blood the inheritance goes and then proceeds: 1442 She is also a gotraja as being born in the gotra in which her brother (the deceased owner) was born. She is, however, not a sagotra (of the deceased brother), but being a sagotra is not mentioned here (in Yaj.) as the condition that leads on to the taking of the wealth of the deceased'. Here the V. Mayūkha plays upon the word gotraja and takes its literal meaning. But that is a specious argument. The

Sister as a gotraja heir

widow and mother are not gotrajas (in this sense of being born in the gotra) but on marriage they enter the gotra of their husbands and become sagotra. Further, on the same reasoning, a son's daughter, brother's daughter, father's sister and other women born in the family of the deceased will become his gotrajas (though not sagotras because on marriage they pass into the gotra of their husbands). But these other women are not expressly recognised even by the V, Mayukha as gotrajas. Even though she was not mentioned in the Mit. the sister has been recognised as a gotraja sapiņda by the Bombay High Court in parts of the Bombay Presidency where the Mit. is the paramount authority. The order of heirs under the Mit, would be as follows:-Full brother, half brother, full brother's son, half brother's son, paternal grandmother, sister (full being preferred to half), paternal grandfather. According to the V, Mayūkha the order is slightly different, viz. full brothers along with sons of full brothers that are dead, full brother's son, grandmother, full sister, halfbrother, halfsister, paternal grandfather. The unmarried sister had been recognized as entitled to a share when brotherg came to a partition and they had to provide for her marriage expenses. Vide above pp. 619-620 and Nār. 1443 ( dāyabhāga, 13), Vişnu Dh, S. 18, 35, Manu IX. 118, Yaj. II. 124. In Madras the sister had been recognized as a bandhu. The Legislature has intervened and laid down ( Hindu Law of Inheritance Amend mont Act II of 1929 ) that in territories governed by the law of the Mitakşarā and in respect of the property of males not held in coparcenary and not disposed by will, a son's daughter, daughter's daughter, sister and sister's son shall be entitled to rank as heirs in the order specified in the Act next after a father's father and before a father's brother. The first three of these were before this Act not at all recognized as heirs in the whole of India except in Bombay (where the sister was recog nised as a gotraja sapiņda and the first two as bandhus ) and except in Madras ( where the first three were recognized only as bandhus ). The sister's son was given a very high place as a sapiņda under the Dayabhāga and was treated as a bandhu elsewhere in India. This enaótment does not affect the Daya bhaga scheme and so the three females mentioned in the Aot are not heirs even now under the Dayabhaga. The sister's place as settled by Bombay decisions is after the paternal

grandmother and before the paternal grandfather, while the above Act places her after the paternal grandfather. In Bai Mahalaxmi v. The Deputy Nazir 45 Bom. L. R. 434 it has for this reason been held that the Act does not apply to the Bombay Province. If it be held that the Act does apply to Bombay (except as to the sister), then the same Act will have to be deemed to be laying down two different orders of succession as to the same four heirs in different provinces, which, to say the least, is not a reasonable or desirable way of interpreting statutes (just as in the case of texts ). 

Some difficulty is caused by the use of the word santāna in the Mit, as regards the father's, grandfather's and great-grand father's line. It has been seen above (p. 731 ) that the compact series ends with the brother's son (father's son's son i. e. after two descendants of the father) according to the Bombay High Court, while elsewhere in India it is supposed to end with the brother's son's son ( i. e. after three descendants of the father ). The Mit. expressly mentions only two descendants in the grand father's and great-grandfather's line. The general rule is that Bapiņda relationship extends to six descendants of each line (excluding the man or ancestor from whom the counting is made ). The further general rule gathered from the meagre words of the Mit. is that the nearer line excludes the more remote (eg, the grandfather, his son and grandson are express ly mentioned by the Mit, as taking before the great-grand father, his son and grandson). The question is whether the 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th descendants of a nearer line would exclude even the 1st or 2nd descendant of a remoter line e. g. whether the great-grandson of the grandfather would take before the son or grandson of the great-grand-father or whether the 6th descendant of the grandfather would take before the son of the great-grandfather. There were three views 1444 on this point. 

1444. Vide Buddha Singh v. Læltu Singh L. R. 42 1. A, 208 pp. 220-24 · for the three views and their expounders. The P. C. overruled the first view and held (p. 227) that the descendants in each ascendlag line up to the fixed limit should be exhausted at any rate to the third degree before making tbe ascent to the next llue in order of succession. m pentru curata unaou n g Portretfag an Art rograma da guarratifuntovauTiT.

Three views about gotraja succession 

751 

The first view, relying upon certain words of the Sm. O., held that after two descents in each line, one should ascend into a remoter line and after the two descendants of that line are exhausted, one should revert to the 3rd to 6th descendants of a nearer line. The 2nd view was that in each line three genera tions were to be first exhausted, because the word putra in several places in the Mit. includes the three male descendants. The 3rd view 1445 was that in each line six descendants were to be exhausted before ascending to the next remoter line ( 48 sapinda relationship extended to six degrees ). 

Another question is whether the widows of agnatic relations (such as the son's widow, brother's widow, step-mother or paternal uncle's widow) are included in the term 'gotrajāḥ' for purposes of inheritance. Under the Dāyabhāga, as well as under the Mitākşarī throughout India (except in the Bombay School), the widows of gotraja sapiņdas are not heirs at all, since according to almost all writers women do not inherit except when expressly mentioned by texts. In the Bombay School the position is different. According to both the Mit. and the Mayükha, wives enter by marriage the gotra of their husbands and become sapindas of their husbands. The Balambhatti declared the son's widow to be an heir even before the paternal grandmother and includes females also in the word gotrajāḥ. When gotraja was rendered as samānagotra, the term became wide enough not only to include those born in the gotra but even those who entered the gotra by marriage. Besides, it was argued that if the paternal grandmother or. paternal great-grandmother succeeded as a gotraja there was no reason why other widows of other gotrajas should not succeed. From the earliest days of British rule the gotraja sapindas (such as the son's, brother's, paternal uncle's widows) have been recognized as heirs in the Bombay Presidency. They take only a limited estate like the owner's widow 'or mother or 

1445. The third view was propounded by Telang J. in Rachava v, Kalingappa 16 Bom, 716,' which is referred to by the P. C. in 42 I. A, 208. at pp. 220 and 226. The P. C. do not dissent from Telang J. but do not expressly approve of his views as it was not necessary to do so in that case, where the question was whether the great-grandson of the grandfather of the deceased was to be preferred to the grandson of the great-grandfather and it was beld by the P, C, that he was to be preferred. The 2nd view appears to be supported by the words of Aparārka p. 745 & TT NYT स्तत्पौत्र इति पितुसन्तती प्रपा प्रत्यासमाः सपिण्याः । एवं पितामहसन्तती प्रपितामहसन्तती च। एषामभावे पित्रादित्रयस्प ये प्रपौत्रास्तेषां पुत्रादित्रयं सापिण्डवाबनवाएकम् ।।752

paternal grandmother. They are recognized rather on the ground of positive acceptance and usage' by the Privy Council than on the ground of any texts 1446 They occupy the same place as their husbands, succeed after the compact serios, the sister and half-sister and only after all the male gotraja sapiņdas (up to the 7th degree inclusive of the ancestor ) properly belonging to the line to which their husbands belonged; 0. g. the son's widow would succeed before the brother's son's 1447 son, the brother's widow or step-mother would succeed after all the six male descendants of the husband's father, but before the father's father, paternal uncle or his son &c. These widows of gotraja sapiņdas succeed before any bandhu. Since Act XVIII of 1937 a man's own widow, his predeceased son's widow and the widow of a predeceased son's predeceased son succeed along with his son or sons throughout India. 

Samanodakas. According to the Mit. gotrajas are either sapiņdas or Bamā nodakas. The word 'samanodaka' has a technical meaning. Aco. to Manu V.60, 'the sapinda relationship ceases with the seventh person; the relationship of samānodaka148 ends when birth ( in the family) and name are no longer known'. This ocours in the chapter on impurity. The Mit. declares that the samānodakas comprise males seven generations beyond the gapiņdas or all males (beyond sapipdas ) whose birth (in the same family as that of the deceased) and name are known. It quotes a text of Bphan-Manu, 'the sapinda relationship ceases with the seventh person; the relation of

samānodaka ceases after the 14th; according to some it extends as far as the memory of name and family (or birth) reach; the gotra is said to extend up to that'. The samanodakas comprise the 7 ascendants of a person after the great-grand father's great-grandfather, the 13 descendants of these seven ascendants, the 7 descendants after the 6th descendant of his 6 male ancestors from his own father; and descendants of himself from the 7th to the 13th. The Privy Council have ruled 149 in a recent case that, according to the Mitākşarā school, samānodaka relationship does not extend beyond the 14th degree (from and inclusive of the common ancestor of the claimant and the propositus). 

The word 'samānodaka' literally means ' those who offer to or receive water from the same person'. The word is employed by Vas. 1450 17. 79. But in the law of inheritance it has a technical meaning as stated above.

The case of Bai Devkoro v. Amritram 10 Bom, 372 where the word samānodaka was interpreted to include any agnate without any limit of degree was not over ruled but was distinguished on the ground that it was governed by the law of the Vyavahāra-mayükba which quotes only Manu V. 60 and does not quote Brhan-Manu.

1451. The word "bandhu' is a very ancient one and has been used in various senses throughout the ages. In Rg. I. 113. 2 Night and Dawn (Uşas) are called samānabandhū ( bound together or having a common relative). In Rg. I. 154. 5 (urukramasya sa hi bandhur-itthā ) the word appears ta be used in the sense of 'friend' lo Rg. I, 164, 33 Dābhi' and 'bandhy' are employed one after another. The sage Vasistha tells Asvins (Rg. VII. 72.2) that their mutual friendship is ancestral and their relation is common (yuvorhi naḥ sakhyā pitryāni samāno bandhuruta tasya vittam ). Vide also Rg. V. 73. 4, VIII. 21. 4, VIII. 100. 6.

Mayükha and all other authorities except those of the Dayabhāga school only on failure of samānodakas (or sodakas). It will have been noticed from the discussion above that gotrajas, whether sapiņdas and samā nodakas, are all agnates (and in some cases their wives) i. e, persons related to the deceased by unbroken male descent. The bandhus are persons related to the deceased through one or more females. The basic texts on the inherit ance of bandhus are three verses attributed to Vrddha-Satātapa

IV. 22 (asnie ramasvāsme te bandhuḥ )' the poet prays that the god may find delight in them and find in them his bandhu, Among sūtras Gaut. IV. 3 and Vārāhagṛhya 9 speak of pitbandhus - aod mātrbandbus (persons related through the fatber and mother). In Yaj. the word bandhu or bandhava occurs many times and bas at least three senses viz, relative in general (in I. 82, 108, 113, 116, 220 ; II. 144, 280 ; III. 11, 239), agnate (II. 294), cogaate (II, 135, 149, 264). Manu IX. 158 and XII, 79 employ the word bandhu in the sense of relative in general. The Ap. Dh, S. 1. 7. 21. 8 and II. 5. 11. 16 and Gaut. 14. 18 employ the word 'yonisambandha' for persons connected through a female. On the other band Panini V. 3. 23 (rto vidyāyonisambandhebbyah) appears to em. ploy the word in a general sense viz. blood relation' (whether paternal or materjal). Another word frequently used from Vedic times is 'jñāti' which generally means 'agnate' or ' relative'. Vide Rg. X, 66. 14, X. 117. 9. In the Atharvaveda IV. 5. 6 a man desirous of a clandestine intercourse with a wooran prays 'svāpantvasyai jnātayaḥ svaptvayam-abhito janah'. In I. 1. 35 Pānini appears to use the word jāāti in the sense of agnates FAIT fanature. Io Gaut. II. 43, Ap. Dh. S, I. 3. 10.3 jñāti' occurs and is explained by Haradatta as agaatic relations. In Manu III. 31 (inātibhyo dravinam dattva) jñati appears to mean paternal relations. In Manu III, 264, IV. 179, Yāj. II, 149 jñāti is distinguished from bandhava or bandhu and so means 'agaates', Two other words are 'sajāta' and 'sanābbi', The first occurs in the Tai. S. I. 6. 2. 1 and I. 6. 10. i (ugrohan sajāteşu bhayāsam) and in the Atharvaveda I. 9. 3, III. 8. 2. VI. 5. 2 and moans *agnates or kidsmen'. The word sanābbi occurs in Rg.

Three verses on bandhus

or Baudhāyana. They may be translated as follows: The sons of one's father's sister, the sons of one's mother's sister and the sons of one's maternal uncle these are to be known as at mabandhus ( one's own bandhus); the sons of one's father's father's sister, the sons of one's father's mother's sister, the son's of one's father's maternal uncle--these are to be known as one's pitsbandhus (father's bandhus ); the sons of one's mother's father's sister, the sons of one's mother's mother's sister, the sons of one's mother's maternal uncle these are to be known as the mālfbandhus mother's bandhus ). 1452 The Mit. states on this toxt that bandhus are of three kinds viz, ātma bandhus, pitrbandhus and mātsbandhus and that atmabandhus succeed before pitsbandhus on account of their greater propin quity to the deceased and pitrbandhus succeed before the mātsbandhus. 1453 The treatment of the rights of bandhus in the Mit. and other commentaries and digests is very meagre. This has led in modern times to a bewildering mass of case law on the inheritance of bandhus. 

The first question is whether the enumeration of bandhus in the verses quoted is exhaustive or only illustrative. The V. P. expressly 1454 states that if the enumeration be held to be exhaustive absurd results would follow. For example, a maternal uncle's son is expressly named as an ātmabandhu in the verses quoted above, but his father (the maternal uncle ), being not mentioned, would on that hypothesis be excluded. Therefore it was held by the Privy Council in a very early case 1455 that the enumeration of bandhus is only illustrative, that the maternal uncle though not mentioned is a nearer

bandhu and would succeed in preference to his own son who is expressly mentioned. In Balasubrahmanya v. Subbayya 65 L A, 93 it was held that under the Mitākşarā the principle of proximity of blood relationship applies to the succession of bandhus, that in determining which of two ātmabandhus is entit led to succeed nearness of degree and not religious efficacy is the proper test to apply, that when the atmabandhus are equal in degree the test of religious efficacy may be applied to determine preference and that the maternal uncle of the deceased is entitled to preference over the deceased's father's half sister's son. This was followed in Virangauda v. Yellappa I. L. R. (1943) Bom. 259 (F. B.) where the mother's brother of the deceased was preferred to the father's sister's son. So also the mother's father would be a bandhu, It is strange that the deceased's own descendants through a female or the deceased's father's descendants through a female such as the son's daughter's son, daughter's son's son, daughter's daughter's son, sister's son or sister's daughter's son, are not mentioned in any authoritative commentaries or digests as his bandhus. Further, the bandhus enumerated in the three verses do not go beyond the 4th degree from the common ancestor. But bandhu relationship extends up to five degrees at least. There is an ancient instance of the sister's daughter's son having succeeded to a Buddhist bhikṣu in Cambodia ( in sake 586 ). This would be so only according to the principles of the Mit. Vide Indian Cultural Influence in Cambodia'p. 55 by Dr. Bijan Raj Chatterji (Cal. 1928). All the above (such as the son's daughter's son) have been recognized by the Indian Courts as ātmabandhus entitled to inherit. In United Provinces v. Kanhaiya Lal 16 Lucknow 551 it has been held that the father's father's daughter's son's son would be an ātmabandhu of the deceased. In an early case 1456 in British India two propositions were laid down, viz. (1) there must be mutuality of sapiņda relation between the deceased and the claimant (i. e. each must be a sapiņda of the other) and (2) that in order that a man may be an heritable bandhu of the deceased they must be related directly through themselves or 

1456. Vide Umaid Bahadur v. Udoi Chand 6 Cal. 119 (F. B. , 128 where it was held that a man's sister's daughter's son is a heritable bandhu but a remark was made (which was ao obiter diotum) that the sister's daughter's son's son would not be a bandbu of the propositus because the lātter was not a descendant of the grandfather of the former, his father or mother.

Propositions about bandhus

through their mother or father. These propositions were accepted by the Privy Council, 1457 which further said that sapinda rela tionship extends in the case of bandhus only up to five degrees. The first proposition about mutuality has some support in the interpretation put on the famous verse of Manu IX. 187 by the Balambbatti and the Subodhini (vide above note 1418). But difficulty is created about mutuality by the unwarranted assumption that the common ancestor must be a member of one out of four families as stated by Sarvadhikari. The other propositions, however, are not supported by any texts or sound reasoning. Since the enumeration of bandhus is admitted to be not exhaustive, no sound inference can be drawn from the list of nine bandhus that a heritable bandhu must be connected with the deceased in any particular way. All that can be required is that he must be a bandhu as defined by the Mit, and connected with the deceased by having particles of the body of a common ancestor within the limits of sapinda relationship as laid down by the Mit. The limit of five degrees categorically laid down by the P. C. is not, it is sub mitted with great respect, based on very sure or strong founda tions. The Mit. says that sapiņda relationship extends to seven degrees when traced through the father, that wherever the word 

sapinda' is employed this meaning has to be understood and it extends up to five degrees when traced through the mother. Vide H. of Dh. Vol. II. pp. 454-455. What is material is 

1457. Vide Ramchandra v. Vinayak L. R. 41 I. A. 290 (→ 42 Cal. 384 at pp.-418-421) for the propositions about mutuality, relationship through bimself, father or mother and restriction to five degrees. Dr. Sarva dhikari (T. L, L. p. 630ff) is not right ia inferring from the nine bandhus expressly mentioned in the verses quoted above that the propositus must be a descendant of a common ancestor who is a member of the following fami lies, viz. (1) claimant's agnate family, (2) claimant's mother's agnate family, (3) claimant's father's mother's agnate family, (4) claimant's mo ther's mother's agaate family. Following this opinion, it was held in Lowji u. Mithabai 2 Bom, L. R. 842 that the great-grandson of a sister is not an heir under Hindu Law, But this decision is against the definition of sapinda given by the Mit. apd is wrong. Vide Chinna v. Padmanabha 44 Mad, 121 pp. 128-130 for a reasoned and trenchant criticism of the re quirement of mutuality laid down without any discussion or explanation in the case of 6 Cal. 119 and the views of Sarvadhikari. It is to be regretted that owing to the ignorance of Sanskrit on the part of most judges that had to decide cases of Hindu Law, the opinions of individual learned authors like Mayne and Sarvad bikarl were followed without personal examination by judges of the authorities on which the opinions of authors were based.

History of Dharmasastra 

not whether a female intervenes somewhere, but whether the person about whose sapiņdaship a question is raised traces his descent to a common ancestor through his father or through his mother. In the P. C. case the claimant claimed sapinda. ship with the deceased through his mother, and it was rightly decided that he boing 6th from the common ancestor was not a bandhu. But to lay down as a universal rule that a bandhu in order to inherit under the Mit. should not be beyond five degrees from the common ancestor is against the definition of sapiņda given by the Mit. itself and unduly narrows the express words of the Mit. The words of the P. C. 'the sapiņda relationship, on which the heritable right of collaterals is founded, ceases in the case of the bhinna-gotra sapiņda with the fifth degree from the common ancestor' (L. R. 41 I. A, 290 at p. 312) are very generally expressed and are susceptible of the interpretation that they lay down the rule of five degrees even when the claimant claims 1458 relationship with the deceased through his own father. Some support for the Privy Council rule that sapinda relationship ceases with the 5th 

1458. Vide Brij Mohan v. Kishun Lal (1938) A. L. J. 670 where the Allahabad High Court held that, even when the claimant traced sapinda relationship through his father, beritable bandhu relation ceases after the fifth degree. But in Kesar Singh v. Secretary of State for India 49 Mad. 652 at p. 690 it is said that, though in the P. C. decision there are some observations wbich at first sight imply that sapinda relationship of bandhus for inheritance ceases with the 5th degree in all cases, there is nothing to suggest that the Privy Council intended to do away with the wellknown distinction between bhinnagotra sapindas that claim relationship through their father and those tbat trace it through their mother. There is great diversity of view yet about what the P. C. meant in 41 I, A, 290. In Seelam Nagamma v. Reddam 1. L. R. (1943) Mad. 759 (F. B.) it was held that Dr. Sarvadhikari is wrong in his restrictions of heritable bandhus to the lines he propounds, that 54 All. 698 is wrongly decided and that 49 Mad. 652 lays down the correct law. On the other hand, in Hanmant v. Vasudev I. L. R. (1943) Bom. 465 it bas been held that the P. C. means that heri. table baadbug wbether claiming through the father or the mother must be within five degrees from the common ancestor. Vide Debi Das v. Mukat Behari I. L. R. (1943) All. p 131 which lays down several rules deducible from an examination of numerous cases. As an illustration of how the law of the succession of bandhus is in a bewildering state, the following two cases may be read. In Sakharam y. Ralkrishna 19 Bom, 739 (F.B.) it was held that a father'a sister's son is to be preferred under the V. Mayükba to the maternal uncle, but the P. C. decided in Balsubramanya v, Subbayya L. R. 65 I. A. 93 that the maternal uocle is entitled to preference over the father's sister's son.

degree from the common ancestor in the case of bhinnagotra sapiņdas may be found in the words of Mitramiśra in his commentary on Yāj. I. 5%, in the implication of the words of Kullūka 1489 on Manu V, 60 and in the remarks of the Balambhatti (p. 191 ). But this view is opposed to other weighty authorities such as the Nirnayasindhu and the Dharma sindhu. 

The whole law about the succession of bandhus is in a confused state owing to conflicting decisions, but the P. O. has laid down certain propositions which may be set down here: (1) atmabandhus succeed before pitšbandhus and pitsbandhus before mātpbandhus ; (2) the nearer in degree in each class of bandhus is preferable to the more remote; (3) as between bandhus of the same class, the conferring of spiritual benefit would be a ground of preference, as the Viramitrodaya invokes that principle in several cases (and so the father's half sister's son would be preferred to the mother's sister's son, though both are atmabandhus and of equal degree ); (4) if the above three rules fail, bandhus ex parte paterna (on the father's side ) succeed before bandhus ex parte materna (on the mother's side ); (5) the bandhu between whom and the propositus a lesser number of females intervenes is to be preferred. As a corollary of the 2nd rule it should follow that the descendants of the propositus would be preferred to ascendants and collaterals and that ban dhus of the same class that are descendants of a nearer line would succeed in preference to descendants of a remoter line though of the same class. But this last proposition has not yet been settled by the Privy Council. It has been, however, held in Debi Dus v. Mukat Behari I. L. R. (1943) All. 131 that a sister's son's son should be preferred to the deceased's cousin's daugh ter's son, since the former belongs to a nearer line. 

For the purposes of this work it is irrelevant and unneces sary to wade through the mass of case-law on the succession of

bandhus. One or two matters, however, call for remark. If the theory of spiritual benefit be strictly applied, many of those who would inherit as bandhus under the Mit. system would be barred from inheritance. For example, the daughter's son's son 1459a or daughter's daughter's son would be a heritable bandhu under the Mitākṣarā, but under the Dāyabhāga he would not be 80, as he offers no piņda to the deceased or to any of the latter's ancestors. It is probably to obviate this unnatural and unjust consequence that the Dāyatattva refers to the text of Bț. (quoted above in n 1419) in which the word 'bāndhavāḥ' occurs, remarks that the relatives of the father and mother of (the deceased ) inherit in the order of their nearness to the latter and quotes the three verses about the three classes of bandhus, indicating thereby that spiritual benefit is not the sole test, but that where it fails the test of blood relationship may be applied. 1460 

Very elaborate rules have been evolved by Sarvadhikari in his Tagore Law Lectures on the Hindu Law of inheritance (2nd ed. of 1922, pp.571-640). The author devoted great industry, labour and ingenuity in evolving those rules. But one regrets to say that he raised a stupendous structure on very slippery and meagre foundations. And the pity of it is that many Judges have more or less followed his lead, though emphatic disapproval of his views, whereby the list of bandhus capable of inheriting has been very much restricted, has not been wanting. 1461 It is not possible to examine here in detail his reasonings and results. But the futility of much that he has evolved can and must be briefly shown,' The only solid foundations that we have in the Mit. are: (1) the definition of sapiņda given by it on Yāj. I. 53; (2) the remark that bandhus are bhinnagotra sapiņdas (as contrasted with gotrajas); (3) that the bandhus of a man may be described under three classes; (4) that those that may be called atmabandhus succeed before those called pitsbandhus and these latter inherit before mātřbandhus.

Sarvadhilari's scheme of bandhu succession 

761 

the nine bandhus enumerated in the verses of Śālātapa or Baudhā. yapa are only illustrative. Therefore, the nine bandhus ex pressly mentiond should not have been used to exclude any one as not a heritable bandhu, as we have not got anywhere an exhaustive enumeration. Any one who satisfied the first two requirements stated above was a bandhu. Of the nine bandhus enumerated in the verses quoted above, none is connected by direct descent with the propositus, his father or mother; but one is a descendant of his paternal grandfather, one of his paternal great-grandfather, two of his maternal grandfather, two of his father's maternal grandfather, one of his mother's paternal grandfather, two of his mother's maternal grandfather. Sarva dhikari makes a different classification of these (p. 627) viz. * two are connected through the father, three through the mother, two through the paternal grandmother and two through the maternal grandmother'. The whole trouble has been caused by this latter grouping. Instead of emphasizing lines of direct descent, he catches hold of females who are never spoken of in ancient works in connection with tracing descent ( except in the case of the mother of the man concerned ). If, because the illustrations given happen to be connected only with four lines of families, persons connected with the propositus through other lines are to be excluded, there is no reason why a man's own daughter's son's son, son's daughter's son, sister's son, or sister's son's son should be held to be bandhus. They bear no close analogy to the atmabandhus enumerated by Śātātapa. But it is admitted by Sarvadhikari that they are atmabandhus. The terms atmabandhu, pitsbandhu and mātsbandhu are mere labels or devices to show nearness and preference among bandhus. Acc. to the V. Mayūkha1462 the words pitpbandhu and mātsbandhu are to be dissolved as sasthi-tatvuruşa compounds ( pituḥ bāndhavaḥ

or matuh bandhavaḥ) i. e, according to it pitbandhus or mātpbandhus are bandhus of the father or mother and must also be bandhus of the propositus if they are to inherit. It is not known in what context the three verses quoted in the Mit. and other digests from Satātapa or Baudhāyana occurred. In Manu V. 81 It is laid down that one should observo mourning on the death of a pupil, sacrificial priest and bāndhavas for the duration of paksini. It is possible that the three verses only illustrate what is meant by bāndhavas in such a connection, 

The Balambhatti ( vyavabāra p. 214 ) here also explains that females are included in the word 'bandhu', although the verses quoted speak of putrah' only and the Bombay and Madras High Courts have allowed female bandhus to inherit, though in Madras the position assigned to female bandhus is 

very much lower than in Bombay. 

Strangers as Heirs-In default of even bandhus, the Mit. states 1463 that the teacher(of the veda) is the heir of the deceased, in default of the teacher the pupil (and relies on Ap. Dh. S II. 6. 14. 3) and that in default of pupil ā sabrahmacarin ( fellow student whose upanayana was performed by the same teacher as that of the deceased and who studied the veda under the same teacher ) 1464 inherits. In the absence of even a fellow student the wealth of a brahmana was to be given to some grotriya (a brāhmana learned in the Veda ) as laid down by Gaut. ( 28, 39) and in default of a śrotriya in the same village, as said by the Dāyabhāga XI. 6. 27, to any brāhmapa, since Manu (IX. 188-189) says, 'in the absence of all (heirs ), brāhmaṇas that have studied the three vedas, that are pure and restrained, take the wealth; in this way dharma does not suffer : the rule is that the wealth of a brahmana should never be taken by the king'. Nār, 1465 ( dāyabhāga, 51-52 ) is to the same effect. To the game

This direction of so many ancient sages has not been respected in modern times. 1467 Manu (IX. 189) and Bṛ. 1468 (S, B, E. vol. 33, p. 380 verse 67) say that the wealth of kşatriyas, vaiśyas and šūdras oscheats to the king in default of heirs up to a fellow student. When the king takes by escheat heirless property he has to set apart a portion of the wealth of the deceased for the maintenance of his concubines and servants and for the per formance of his funeral rites and sraddhas as stated by Kat. 1469 931. Kaut. IIL 5, Nār.(dāyabhaga,52) provide that the king (when he takes heirlege property ) should provide maintenance for his women and both tle Mit. and the V. Mayükha explain that the word' women' stands for avaruddhastri (exclusively kept concubine) and not for his wives ( who would succeed as heirs and then there would be no escheat), because the word * patni' is not employed in the verse. These verses of Nār. and Kāt. are the foundation of the right to maintenance of a concubine against the heirs of the deceased paramour in modern times. 1970

Yaj. (IL. 137) states a special rule 1471 which is an exception to the general rule of inheritance laid down in II. 135-136 vie. '(the heirs) who take the wealth of a forest hermit, a yati (ascetic), a (perpetual) vedio student are in order the ( vedic) teacher, a virtuous pupil, one who is looked upon as a brother and belongs to the same order! According to the Mit. the heirs mentioned are to be taken in the reverse order of the words of the text i. e. the ācārya ( who is mentioned first among the three heirs ) is to be taken as the heir of the last of the three mentioned in the first half of the verse, so that the teacher, good pupil and the person looked upon as brother are respec tively the heirs of the perpetual student, the ascetic and the forest hermit. According to the Dāyabhāga also the reverse order has to be taken, but it says that the wealth of the forest hormit, yati and perpetual student is taken respectively by one looked upon as brother, a worthy pupil and teacher, but that in the absence of these, any one who is in the same āśrama as the deceased may take it. According to the Madanaratna 1172 the order of heirs is the direct one, that is, the teacher, good pupil and accepted brother take the wealth of the forest hermit, ascetic and perpetual student, since the Visnu Dh. S. (17. 15-16) expressly says so. The Mit. adds that a brahmacārin is of two kinds viz. perpetual ( naisthika) and upakurvana ( who intends to remain as a student for some time and then marry in order to confer the benefit of male progeny on his ancestors ), that

Succession to an ascetic

Yajñavalkya's words apply only to the former, that if the latter ( upakurvāņa ) leaves any wealth of his own it is taken by his mother, father and the other heirs. The Mit. further says that a worthy pupil is one who is capable of studying the philosophical parts of the Veda, of understanding them and of acting up to them, that a badly behaved pupil will not succeed, so also a badly conducted teacher shall not succeed. The Mit. explains that Yāj. III. 47 allowed a forest hermit to accumulate materials that will be enough to meet his needs for a day, a month or six months or a year and so he may on his death leave some wealth. Similarly, though an ascetic was required by Gautama ( U. 10 ) to make no accumulation of wealth, yet even an ascetic requires clothes to cover his body, he has his sandals and books on Yoga and the like ; and so also the perpetual student requires these. 

· The heirs enumerated above succeed to persons in those religious orders in priority of their kindred. It has been held that members of the three twice-born classes alone can be ascetics with the result that their pupils inherit and not the kindred and that in the case 1473 of sūdra ascetics their kindred succeed unless some usage to the effect that a pupil inherits is proved.

* Reunion.-A rounion properly so called can take place only between those who were parties to the original partition. Reunion, therefore, postulates three stages, viz. (1) joint family, (2) partition between members of a joint family, (3) an inten tion and an agreement, express or implied, to reunite in estate among members who were parties to the partition. If persons who had separated in interest merely stay together, that is not

reunion in law, as sald by the Sm. C. II. p. 302 and Vivadar candra 174 p. 82. The Vivadacandra quoting Visnupurana says that reunion may be implied from a course of conduct, even though an express agreement cannot be proved. There is a divergence of views as to who can reunite. The Mit., the Dayabhaga 1175, the Sm. C. hold, literally construing a verse of Br. (S. B. E. 33 p. 381 verse 72 ), that a member of a joint family when once divided can reunite only with his father, brother or paternal uncle, but not with any other relation (such as a paternal uncle's son or paternal grand-father), while the V. C. (p. 157), the V. Mayükha (p. 146), the V. P. (p. 533) hold that the members expressly mentioned by Bç, are only illustrative and that a person may reunite with any member who was a party to the original partition. A reunited person is called sainsęsta or sařsrstin 1476 ( who has reunited wealth). The subject of reunion has a comparatively ancient history. Gaut. 28. 26 states the general rule that on the death of a reunited co-parcener the surviving reunited member succeeds to the share of the deceased. Kaut. (III.5p. 160) states 1477 that those, who live together though they may have no ancestral estate or do so after dividing their ancestral estate, may divide their reunited estate again in equal shares. Manu IX. 210 (=Vişnu Dh. 8. 18. 41) is similar to it.

Devolution after reunion 

767 

The verses of Yaj. (II. 138-139 ) 1478 on succession to a deceased reunited person are understood by the Mit. to be an exception to the rules contained in Yaj. II. 135-136 laying down that the wife and others inherit the property of a person dying sonlegs. Therefore it follows that where a person reunites with his brother and then dies leaving a son not reunited with him, it is the son who will inherit and not the brother, though reunited. But if A separates from two sons B and C of whom B reunites with him and C does not and then A dies, then the reunited son B succeeds to A's interest and C takes nothing. This is expressly stated by the Vivādacandra p. 85 that relies on the Smộtisāra 1479. The two verses of Yāj. (II. 138-139 ) are variously read and interpreted by the Mit. and other commentators and it is not possible nor quite necessary to set out all these readings and explanations. Acc. to the Mit the two verses mean: 'in the case of a deceased reunited per son, the surviving ) reunited member should give ( to the posthumous son of the former ) the share of the deceased but may take it himself if there is no son ( but only a wife ); but from among the reunited brothers, the full brother, if reunited, should similarly give to the posthumous son of the deceased the latter's share and ( if there be no son ) he should take it himself to the exclusion of reunited half brothers; a re united half brother takes the wealth of the deceased reunited member ( dying sonless ) and not another half brother who is not reunited; a full brother, though not reunited, may take the wealth along with a half brother who is reunited but the latter will not alone be entitled'. In this interpreta tion the word 'asamsýsti' in the latter half of II. 139 has to be taken in two connections, once with anyodaryaḥ' in the first half and then again with 'saṁsrstaḥ' ( in the 2nd half). This last word is to be understood in two senses, viz. 

1478. संधिनस्तु संखष्टी सोदरस्य तु सोदरः । दद्यादपहरेराशे जातस्य च मृतस्य चा अन्योदर्यस्तु संबष्टी योदर्यो धन हरेत् । असंहष्टबपि वादवात्सलतो नाग्यमातुजः॥ gr. II. 138-139. The first is fargerike 17. 17 also. Tra (p. 747) reads

(1) full brother (with the preceding word asamsrsti) and (2) * reunited' (with the word 'anyamātsjah'). Further, aco, to the Mit. we have to understand 'eva' after. anyamātsjah'. Aparārka (p. 748) reads differently and he, Visvarüpa and Srikaramiśra (Dayabhāga XI. 5-16 ) explain that a full brother though not reunited takes the whole estate and not the half brother though reunited with the deceased. The V. Mayūkha differs from the Mit. when it says that the word apurczsya (of one dying sonless) is not to be understood with Yāj. (II. 138). It derives two propositions from the first half of Yaj. II. 138, viz (1) the wealth of one dying reunited is taken by tho surviving reunited member of members; (2) in a competition between reunited full brother and reunited half-brother, the former takes the whole. The latter half of II. 138 is an independent sentence (and not joined with the preceding half as the Mit, understands) and applies where a reunited member dies leaving a wife who is pregnant but that fact being unknown the other reunited members divide the estate. In such a case if a son is born the surviving members should hand over to the son the share of the deceased reunited member. But if no such son is born then the survivors may take the estate. In II. 139 the Mayūkha holds that the words "anyodarya' and ' anyamātsja' are not restricted to brothers only, but apply to a paternal uncle or his sons or other persons who were reunited, because their mother is also different from the mother of the deceased. The Daya bhāga discusses Yāj II. 138-139 under the topic of succession to the separate property of a sonless man and its treatment of succession to reunited property is very meagre ( vide XII ), 1480 The V. P. p.-533 notices this and levels against Jimütavāhana the criticism that he got confused. Aparārka (pp. 748–749) seems to be of the same opinion as the Dāyabhāga. The V. P. follows the Mit. and criticizes the explanation given by Śrīkara, Sm. C. and others ( pp. 535-538). It says that the texts of Sankha, Narada and others conflict with the text of Yāj. II. 135 and that the order of heirs as to a •reunited co-parcener is based on express texts and not on Yāj, II. 135 1481 or logical reasoning. Accord ing to the V. P. the order of succession to a deceased reunited

person seems to be: (1-3) son, grandson, great-grandson; (4) reunited full brother; (5) reunited half brother and separated full brother; (6) reunited mother; (7) reunited father; (8) any other reunited member; (9) half brother not reunited; (10) mother not reunited; (11) father not reunited; (12) widowi (13) daughter; (14) daughter's son; (15) sister. The V. Mayū. kha gives the order as follows: (1) son if reunited; (2) son not reunited, though there may be reunited members (other than a gon); (3) the parents if reunited in preference to other reunited persons (other than a son); (4) full brother if re united; (5) full brother not reunited and half brother reunited; (6) half brothers and uncles, if reunited; (7) other male mem bers reunited (in preference to wife though she be reunited); (8) wife if she be reunited ; (9) full sister (or daughter accord ing to another reading );1482 (10) any other sapiņda who is nearest. It is to be noted that Manu IX. 212 prescribes a peculiar rule of succession for reunited co-parceners viz. that full brothers (not rounited) and full sisters of the deceased reunited co-parcener equally inherit along with half brothers that are reunited the wealth of the deceased. This verse of Manu has been variously explained by Kullūka, Apararka p. 749, Sm, C. (II pp. 304-305 ), Nilakantha, Vivādacandra (p. 83) and others. 

It may be stated here that cases of reunion come very rarely before the courts.

CHAPTER XXX 

STRĪDHANA 

Stridhana ( woman's property ). This subject abounds with differing views on several topics that fall under it, as will be Been below. 

The germs of the topic of stridhana can be traced to the Vedio Literature. As Sir Gooroodas Bannerjee remarks (in : Marriage and Stridhana' p. 370 ), ' nowhere were proprietary rights of women recognized so early as in India; and in very few ancient systems of law have these rights been so largely conceded as in our own'. The wedding hymn in the Rgveda ( X 85 ) contains two verses 1483 ( 13 and 38) which indicate that gifts were sent to the bridegroom's house with the bride, They are : 'the bridal gifts of Sūryā that Savits sent off have gone forth; in the Agbās (Magha constellation) are struck the kine and in the Arjunis ( Phalguni constellation) is carried ( the bridal gift ); for thee in the beginning they carried about Sürya together with the bridal gifts &o.'. Sāyaṇa explains 'vahatu' as 'cows and other objects given for pleasing the girl to be married', while Lanman ( Harvard O. series vol. VIII p. 753) renders it as 'bridal car'. Sāyaṇa's interpretation suits the context much better. In the Tai. S. VI. 2. 1. 1 we read, 1484 'the wife ( of the sacrificer) holds on ( to the cart), for the wife is the mistress of the household gear'. Manu IX. 11 uses the word 'pāriņahya' (household gear) and states that the wife should be entrusted among other matters with the supervision over it. Jaimini 1485, according to Sabara, refers to 

1483, warang: 

A PAT TETE I NIE Tam atrati ogga u तुभ्यममे पर्यवहन सूर्या पहनना सह । पुनः पतिभ्यो जायां दा अमे मजया सह ॥ . x. 85. 13 and 38. These are almost the same as ferrata 14. 1. 13 and 14. 2. 1.

Evolution of woman's property

this passage of the Tai. S. for establishing that women do own certain property. Medhatithi 1486 on Manu VIII. 416 ( cited above on p. 452) quotes this passage of the Tai. S. and argues that if Manu VIII. 416 ( saying that whatever a wife earns is her husband's ) were literally understood passages like the one in Tai. S. would have no scope and that therefore Manu simply means that though women may be owners they cannot dispose of the property independently. It appears from these ancient passages that the properties, which in early days were held to be owned by women, were presents made at the time of marriage (such as ornaments and costly dresses) and household articles that are generally under the control of women and that the later smrti rules about the devolution of stridhana in the female line arose from the peculiar nature of the articles over which dominion was conceded to women. This early state of things is indicated by some of the early sūtras. Ap. Dh. 1487 S. (II. 6. 14. 9) states the view of some predecessors ( which Āp. himself does not approve) that the ornaments belong to the wife and also such wealth as came to her from her agnates (father, brother &c.). Baud. Dh. S. II. 2. 49 says that daughters get the orna ments of their mother and whatever else it is customary for them to get. Vag. 17. 46 prescribes that women ( daughters ) should divide the nuptial presents given to their mother. Sankha (q. by Sam. Pr. p. 851 ) prescribes that in all forms of marriage ornaments and stridhana should be given to the girl. It may be that Manu VIII. 416 only gives expression to an ancient opinion, that the literal meaning of that verge was given up long before and that all that Manu meant was that during coverture a woman was subject to the control of the husband as regards her stridhana. 

..Three principal topics have to be discussed under stridhana viz. what constitutes stridhana, woman's dominion over her

stridhana and inheritance to stridhana. On each one of these topics great diversity of views prevails and the subject has become very complicated, as the Dayabhāga remarks 1488 

Gautama contains three sūtras about the devolution of stridhana, but he does not define or describe it. 1488a Kaut. (III 2. p. 152 ) defines 1489 : 'means of subsistence and what could be tied on the body (i, e. ornaments and jewellery ) constitute stridhana, The means of subsistence should be fixed at 2000 (panas) as the maximum, while there is no limit to ( what may be given) as ābadhya ( ornaments &c.)'. This may be com pared with a verse of Kāt. (902) and a similar 1490 verge of Vyāsa viz. the father, the mother, the husband, brother and kinsmen should give stridhana to a woman according to their means up to two thousand (panas ) except immovable pro perty'. The Sm. C. and V. Mayükha explain that this limit of 2000 applies to gifts made every year, but that if a gift is to be made once for all, then more may be given and even immovable property may be given. 

The term stridbana literally means 'woman's property'. But in the ancient smrti works the word was restricted to certain special kinds of property given to a woman on certain occasions or at different stages of her life. Gradually such kinds of property went on increasing in extent and value. We have to follow this evolution of the meaning and content of the word stridhana. One characteristic feature of stridhana from the times of Gautama downwards has been that it devolved on females in the first instance. The oldest extant definition of it

in Dharmaśāstra 'works is that of Manu 1491 IX. 194: 'what (was given) before the nuptial fire, what was given on the bridal procession, what was given in token of love, what was received from her brother, mother or father, that is called the sixfold woman's property'. The Mit, on Yāj. II. 143 explains that the number six is intended to exclude & smaller number of the kinds of stridhana and does not exclude a larger number. In IX. 195 Manu appears to mention one more kind viz. 'anvā dheya' ( gift subsequent)! Nār. ( dāyabhāga, 8 ) has the same six kinds as Manu IX. 194, but reads 'bhartļdāya' (the hus band's gift ) for Manu's what is given in token of affection, the latter being thus wider than Nārada's words. Yāj. (II. 143 44) enumerateg 1492 the several kinds of stridhana as follows: "what was given (to a woman) by the father, mother, husband or brother or was received by her before the nuptial fire, or what was presented on her husband's marrying another wife (adhivedanika) and the like these are denominated stridhana; so also what is given by the cognate relations ( of the woman), the sulka (fee), and gifts subsequent to marriage'. The Mit. and most of its followers read 'ādhivedanikādyam ca', while Aparārka and the Dayabhāga read 'ādhivedanikam caiva', the difference being that if one reads as the Mit. does, several other kinds not expressly enumerated can be easily included under stridhana. But it should be noted that even without reading 

kādyam', Aparārka explains the verse in the same way as the Mit. does. Vişnu 1493 Dh. S. 17. 18 enumerates almost the same kinds of stridhana as Yaj., but omits the word 'ādya'. 

Among smrti writers Katyayana gives the most elaborate treatment of stridhana in about twenty-seven verses. He

defines several kinds of stridhana enumerated by Manu, Yaj., Nar., and Visnu (in all six) as follows 1494 : what is given to women at the time of marriage before the nuptial fire is declared by the wise to be adhyagni 1495 stridhana. That again which a woman obtains when she is being taken (in ā procession) from her father's house (to the bridegroom's) is declared to be adhya vahanika stridhana. Whatever is given to a woman through affection by the father-in-law or mother-in law and what is received by her at the time of doing obeisance at the feet ( of elders) is said to be pritidatta (gift through affection) stridhana. That is declared to be sulka ( bride's fee) which is obtained as the price of household utensils, of beasts of burden, of milch cattle, ornaments and slaves. Whatever is obtained by a woman after marriage from the family of her husband as also from the family of her (father's) kingmen is said to be anvādheya (gift subsequent). According to Bhṛgu whatever is obtained by a woman after marriage through affection from her husband or from her parents is anvādheya'. It may be noted that Katya yana's definitions of adhyagni and adhyāvahanika are wide

enough to include gifts made even by strangers on those occasions. 

These definitions given by Katyāyana have been accepted by all digests including even the Dayabhāga. 

"That is known as suudāyika which is obtained by a married woman or by a maiden in her husband's or father's house from her brother or from her parents" (Kāt.). Some of the divergences in readings and in interpretation deserve to be noted. Acc. to the reading adopted by the Mit. adhyāvahanika includes all gifts made by any one when the newly married girl is taken from her father's house in a procession, while the reading adopted by the Dāyabhāga 14% and some others ( paitȚkāt) restriots the adhyāvahanika to gifts made by the father's or inother's family only. The V. R. (p. 523 ) includes under adhyāvāhanika also the gifts made by the father-in-law and others when the girl is taken back to her father's house and the V.C. (p. 138 ) says that it is what is obtained at the time of 'dvirügamana'. The Dāyabhāga 1497 (IV. 3. 19-20 p. 93 ) explains 'dohyabharapa-karmiņām' differently as 'the gratifica tion paid by house-builders or goldsmiths to induce her to press her husband to engage thern' or as Vyāsa says 'what is given to a woman to induce her (cheerfully) to go to her husband's house '. The Sm, C. and V. P. explain sulka as the price of the articles which the bridegroom was in the habit of presenting to the bride at the time of marriage or when he started a house. 1498 The V.

1498. The change in the meaning of sulkā is interesting. One mean ing of sulka is 'tax or toll on merchandise'. Vide Vianu Da S. III. 29, Yaj. II. 173, 261, Vas, 19. 37. Pāņini V. 1. 47 uses that word in that sense (archivarengantar fon) and the Kašikā explains it as foragit mara y t. Another sense is 'the fee paid to the bride or her parents by the bridegroom in consideration of marriage'. The word occurs in 

(Continued on the next page) 

776 

History of Dharmasastra 

( Vol. 

Nir. (p. 468 ) states that sulka has two sensos ; (1) what is given as the price of the girl to the guardians of the girl which goes to the mother and brother (on her death); (%) what is given ( by the bridegroom ) as the price of the ornaments for the girl and of the household gear. 1499 Another verge of Kāt. (904) has been quoted by many writers, which restricts the literal sense of the word stridhana, 'over that wealth that is obtained by a woman by mechanical arts (such as spinning ) or from a stranger through affection, the husband has ownership. 

(Continued froin the last page) 

Gaut. 28. 23 and in Sankha (svayan sulkanı vodha) q. by V. R. p. 321. In very ancient days there appears to have been a practice to offer in some casos considerable wealth to the father of the bride to induce him to give her in marriage. Rg. 1. 109. 2 refers to this : 'O Indra and Agni! I have heard that you are more liberal than even an unsuitable (or deficient) son in-law or even a brother-in-law'. Yaska (VI. 9) in explaining this verse remarks that the southern people speak of the husband of the bride that i purchased as vijāmātņ' (for Paşa Timors: TOPTATUM HE FATA P ona:)But this verse also shows that the bride's brother (syāla) bad to give wealth to his sister's husband. Vide H. of Dh. Vol. II, pp. 503-506 for passages about the sale and purcbase of girls in marriage from ancient times right down to 1800 A. D. Though sometimes girls were purchased for marriage, popular feeling gradually asserted itself against this, In the Vanaparva (115. 23 ) Gadhi claims as the custom of his family one thousand horses of the best kind from Rcika when the latter prefer red bis suit for the hand of GĀdhi'daughter (fent : foran परस्समवर्तितम् । एकता पामकर्णाना पाणुराणां तरसिमाम् । सहनं वाजिनी शुल्कमिति of fr ). Vide Anušāsana 4 12 ( for a similar statement) and 2. 31. Mana III, 51 forbids the taking of even a small gratuity through greed by the father when giving away his daughter in marriage and says that if he does so he would be guilty of the sale of his child and in III. 54 (almost the same as Agusāsana 46. 1-2) Manu says that when agnates do not appro priate to themselves the gratuity paid ( by the bridegroom) for the bride but band it over to the bride then it is not sale, but it is honour shown to the girl and is merely kiadness to her. The Mit. defines sulka as the gratuity after getting which the girl is given. The V. C. p. 139 deines it as what is obtained from the husband on condition of furnishing household gear &c.

the rest is declared to be stridhana :.1500 The prima facie view (purvapaksa) in Jai. VI. 1.12 urges that what a woman gets by serving cooked food or by cutting clothes does not belong to her. The gifts from strangers here referred to are other than those made by a stranger before the nuptial fire or at the time of the bridal procession. This definition makes it clear that what is obtained even from a stranger by a maiden or by a woman who is a widow at the time of the gift is pure stridhana, Devala says, 'maintenance ( what was given for maintenance), ornaments, sulka (bride's gratuity ), the profits of money-lending are a woman's stridhana. She alone is entitled to enjoy it and the husband is not entitled to enjoy it except in the case of distress'. 1501 Manu IX. 200 states, the heirs of the husband should not divide ( among themselves ) the ornaments worn by women during the lifetime of their husband; if they divide them they incur sin'. In the printed editions of Manu there is no comment of Medhātithi on this Verse, but the V. R. (p. 509), V. C. p. 139, Dayatattva p. 184 all say that acc. to Medhātithi oven ornaments, though not donated expressly, become stridhana, if worn with the husband's consent. 1532 According to the Vaijayanti such ornaments should be assigned to the share of the woman's husband so that she alone might put them on and that it is not meant that such ornaments are not to be taken into account at all at the time of partition.

[Vol. 

Saudāyika is not a special kind of stridhana, It is rather a comprehensive term for several kinds of stridhana as the defi nition given by Kat. shows and as the v.C.(p. 139) expressly states 1503. It is almost synonymous with stridhana in the tech nical sense. Acc. to most writers, it is wealth received by a woman, whether as a maiden or as a married woman, in her father's or husband's house from her parents or relatives of the father and mother. The Sm. C. II. p. 282 and V. R. p. 511 hold that saudāyika is all wealth obtained by a woman whether as a maidon or as a married woman from her mother, father or paternal relatives only, while the Diyabhāga IV. 1. 23 pp. 76-77 and V. C. hold that saudāyika includes also all property donated by the husband except immovable property, which latter she cannot alienate even after her husband's death. There is a Verse of Vyāsa 1504 that defines saudayika similarly, 'whatever is obtained by a woman as a maiden at the time of marriage and after marriage from the house of her father or husband is termed saudayika.' The word 'saudayika' is derived from 

sudaya' and means, according to the Dayabhaga IV. 1.22 p. 76, ' received from affectionate kindred'. The Amarakosa Bays that 'sudaya' means 'gifts of yautaka and the like' and that saudayaka is merely a derivative without change of meaning. 1505 

Another word requiring explanation is 'yautaka'. It occurs in Manu IX. 131, 'whatever is the yautaka of the mother goes to the maiden daughter' (and not to the married daughter or son). So yautaka seems to be a synonym for stridhana in

the technical sense. The Sm. 1506 O. II p. 285, Madanaratna (folio 105 b ) and V. Mayūkha remark 'yautaka is that wealth that is received as a gift from anybody by a woman while she is seated together with her husband at the time of marriage and the like'. It is derived from yuia ( joined ). It should, however, be noted that Yaj Il. 149 employs the word yautaka as an adjective in the sense of separated' and that Medhatithi on Manu IX. 131 explains 'yautaka' as the separate property of a woman, her stridhana. The Sm. O. II. p. 285 remarks that Devasvāmi derived "yautaka' from 'yu' (to separate ) and held it to mean 'wealth obtained from the family of the woman's father which is separate in its characteristics'. The V. C. p. 142 and Vivādacandra p. 74 read 'yautuka' and the former explains it as gifts from the father and the like at the time of marriage. The Dayatattva (p. 186 ) states that both forms 'yautaka' and 'yautuka' are in vogue and relies on Vācaspati and Rayamukuta in support. 

Kaut. (III. 2. p. 153) names sulka, anvādheya, adhivedanika and bandhudatta as kinds of stridhana. 

The above are the principal smrti texts on the question of what constitutes stridhana. It will be seen that the smrtis only enumerate and describe certain kinds of property as stridhana, which word is not used by them in the etymological sense of 'all kinds of property possessed by a woman'. They do not attempt a comprehensive definition of stridhana. From the texts of the smrtis it follows that stridhana was a technical term, which at first included only six kinds of property, then nino and ultimately by the time of Katyāyana it included all property (whether movable or immovable) obtained by a woman, either as a maiden or at marriage or after marriage.

from her parents or the family or relatives of the parents or from the husband and his family (except immovable property given by the husband) and that what was obtained by a woman after her marriage by her own labour or from strangers did not become stridhana. Most emptis employ the word 'datta' ( donated ), but Kat, and Vyāsa sometimes use the word * obtained' (prāpto or labdha), which is ordinarily wider than 

datta'. But it is clear that the commentators do not expressly. say that 'obtained' includes inherited', though from their general remarks to be quoted below it is arguable that they probably included inherited property under property obtained. 

This is stridhana in a technical sense. 

It is now necessary to find how stridbana was defined by the several commentaries and digests that are held authorita tive in the several schools. This is a most important matter for practical purposes, since the courts have to follow the opinions of commentators 1507 that are authoritative in each school and are not at liberty to put their own construction upon ancient smsti texts, if such construction would run counter to the express opinions of the authoritative commentators. First then comes the Mitakşarā. Its gloss on Yāj. II. 143 may be translated as follows 1508; 'whatever is given by the father, mother, husband and brother; what was presented by the maternal uncle and the like at the time of marriage before the nuptial fire; and adhivedanika, that is, gift made (by the husband) at the time of marrying a second wife as will be described subsequently in the words he should give to the wife that is superseded'( Yāj. II. 148 ); by the word ' adya' (meaning and the like ') is indioated property that is obtained by succession, purchase, partition, seizure or finding-all this is declared by Manu and others to be stridhana. The word stridhana is employ ed here in its etymological sense and not in a technical sense, since, when the etymological sense is possible, it is improper to resort to the technical sense.' The Mitakşarā expanded the

definition of stridbana so as to include under it the five kinds of property of which a man becomes owner in various ways according to Gautama X. 39. The result is that, according to the Mit., property of any description belonging to a woman be comes stridhana even if it be inherited by her from a male as a widow or as a mother or even if it be obtained at & partition by a wife or mother (acc. to Yaj. II. 115 or 123 respectively). The same interpretation of the word 'adya' has been accepted by several works, such as the Madanapārijāta (p. 671 ), the S. V. (p. 379), V. P. (p. 542 ), the Bālambhatti. Aparārka without reading "ādya' gave the same explanation of 'ca' as stated above ( on p. 773). On the other hand, the Dayabhāga gave a restricted meaning to the word. Jimütavāhang reads Yāj. II. 143 as 'ādhivedanikam caiva', quotes the verse of Devala (in note 1501), remarks that stridhana is not restricted to the six kinds of Manu (IX, 194) but includes other kinds mentioned by other smrtis and finally 1509 observes : 'that alone is stridhana which a woman has authority to donate, sell or enjoy indepen dently of her husband's control'. The Dāyabhāga does not expressly state the kinds of property that a woman can dispose of independently of her husband, but immediately after defining stridhana it quotes the texts of Kāt. (about earnings from mechanical arts and gifts from strangers), and Nār. (IV. 28), 

what has been given to a wife by her loving husband, she may spend or give away as she likes even after his death excepting, immovables'. From this it follows that, according to the Dāya bhāga, all gifts from relations except a gift of immovable pro perty mada by the husband and gifts from even strangers made before the nuptial fire or on the bridal procession constitute stridhana, but property inherited by a woman or obtained:on, partitiou, gifts from strangers (other than the two kinds noted above) and property acquired by her by mechanical arts or by her labour are not strīdhana, The Dayatattva olosely follows the Dayabhāga. See on 

The Sm. C. does not give a defintion of stridbana, but it, does not adopt the interpretation of the word 'ādya? given by:

the Mit. Therefore it may be said that it is in line with the Dayabbāga. The Par. M. IIL p. 547 1570 (another Madras autho rity ) appears to follow the Mit., since it says: “adya' in cludes adhivedanika' and what is acquired by inheritance, sale and the like." The Vivādacintamani (the leading authority in Mithila ) does not define stridbana in general, but enumerates the several kinds of strldhana described by Manu, Yāj., Visņu, Kat., and Davala and so is on a par with the Dayabhāga. The V. Mayükha divides stridhana into two kinds, pāridhāşika (tech nical) and aparibhā șika ( non-technical). The former comprises properties expressly stated to be stridhana by the sages, while the latter includes all other property belonging to a woman (except what is called technical) and acquired by her by parti tion or cutting (sewing or other mechanical arts). 1$11 This division is peculiar to the V. Mayukha. The Viramitrodaya (the paramount authority in the Benaros school) agrees with Mit. as stated above. 

It is beyond the scope of this work to go deeply into modern caselaw, But it is necessary to show how the Indian Courts have in modern times dealt with stridhana as defined by the oommentators. It may be said at once that the inclusion by the Mite of property inherited by a woman or obtained at a parti. tion under stridbana has been totally discarded by the Privy Council for all provinces in India except Bombay 1512 A woman may inherit property from a male, such as from her husband, father or son or she may inherit property from a female, that is, from her mother, daughter &c.

are stridbana according to the Mit., but the Privy Counoil has held as to both these kinds that they are not stridhana; e. g. if a daughter inherits property from her father or inherits the stridhana property of hér. mother, it does not become her stri dhana, that on the death of the daughter, the property does not pass to her heirs, but to the next heir of the person from whom she inherited it. The Bombay school makes a distinction. If a woman enters a family by marriage and then inherits to a male of-that family (as e. g. a widow succeeding to her husband, a mother to her son or a predeceased son's widow to her father in-law), the property she inherits is not her stridhana, she takes only a limited estate in it and on her death it passes to the next hoir of the male from whom she inherited. But if a woman inherits from a male belonging to the family in which she was born (e. g. a daughter succeeding to her father, a sister to her brother) or if a woman inherits property from a female, the property so inheritad becomes her stridbana (in Bombay). As to property acquired by a wife or mother on partition 1513, it has been held by the Privy Council that it is not stridhana even in provinces governed by the Mitakşarā (including Bombay). . 

Kāt. (903) declares : 1514 'whatever was given to a woman for wearing only on some occasion (or on condition) or with fraudulent intent by the father, brother or husband is not held to be stridhana.' The idea is that if the father or husband gives some ornament to his daughter or wife for wearing on some special occasion (upādhi ) or if a father or husband in fraud of his co-parceners gives some family property to his daughter or wife it cannot become stridhana. 

Dominion over stridhana.“What is stridhana and what dominion a woman has over stridbana depend on three things, viz. the source of acquiring the property, her status at the time of acquisition (i. e. whether she was a maiden or a married woman whose husband was living or a widow ), the school of law by which she is governed. Cortain verses of Kat, and Nar. are the principal texts on this subject. Kāt. (905-907, 911)

Bays:1515 'on obtaining wealth of the saudāyika kind it is dec lared (lit. desired) that women have independent power over it, since it was given by them (the kindred) as support (or maintenance ) in order that they (women) may not be reduced to a terrible (or wretched) condition. It has been declared that women always have independence in saudāyika property as re gards sale or gift at their pleasure and even in immovables (if sandāyika). A woman, when her husband is dead, may deal with the gift (of movables) given by the husband as she pleases, but she should preserve it as long as he is alive or she may spend it on his family. Neither the husband nor the son, nor the father nor the brothers have power to use or alienate the stridhana of a woman'. The verge of Kat. about property acquir ed by labour or about the gift from strangers through affection and that of Nārada about the gift of immovable property made by the husband have already been quoted. From these texts it follows that a Hindu woman during her maidenhood 1516 could dispose of her stridhana property of every description at her pleasure, that during her widowhood she could dispose of every kind of stridbana including movable property given by the husband but not immovable property given by him and that a married woman whose husband was living could dispose of at her pleasure only that kind of property called saudūyika (i. e, gifts from relations except those made by the husband). Under modern decisions the distinction between saudāyika and

non-saudāyika is retained, 1517 but the distinction between sau dayika given by the relations and that given by the husband is not kept. 1518 Now the woman's power to dispose off as she likes depends on the question whether the gift was meant to pass an absolute estate or a limited estate even if the husband was the donor. During marriage when the husband is living her domi. nion depends under modern law upon the character of the stri dhana. If it is of the kind called saudāyika she can dispose of it by sale, gift or will as she likes without her husband's con sent; but as to other kinds of stridhana property (such as gifts from strangers, property acquired by mechanical arts or property inherited ) she cannot dispose of it without her husband's consent. If she disposes of it without such con sent the alienation is void. According to the D. B. IV. 1. 20 property acquired by a married woman by mechanical arts or by gift from a stranger is subject to the husband's dominion during his life and may be taken by him even when there is no distress. No one else ( except the husband) has got control over oven such stridbana. After the hus band's death, she can dispose of even non-saudāyika stridhana as she likes. But even as regards saudāyika the texts concede certain rights to the husband in certain circumstances. Yaj. II. 147 says: 'the husband is not liable to return to the wife her stridbana taken (i. e. used) by him in a fanine, for (indispangable ) religious acts, in disease, or when imprisoned ( by the creditor or by the king or an enemy ). 1519 

1517. Vide Bhau v. Raghunath 30 Bom. 229 (where it was held that property inherited by a woman from her father could not be bequeathed by her without the consent of the husband who survived her).

History of Dharmasastra 

[Vol. 

Kāt. (914) 1530 has a similar verse which says that he may return stridhana wealth if he chooses to do so when it is used by him in a disease or in oalamities or when haragged by creditors. Kaut. (III. 2 p. 152 ) is closely similar to Yaj. and adds that the woman can spend it without blame for the maintenance of herself, her son and daughter-in-law or when the husband has gone abroad without making provision for the maintenance of these. Kaut (III. 2. p. 152 ) further provides 1521 that thero should be no complaint (by the wife ) as regards the expenditure of stridhana made more than three years before by joint action of the busband and wife when they have given birth to two children (or to twins) and when the marriage has been in the most approved forms (brahma and the other three ), that when stridhana has been expended by ( the husband and wife) that are married in the gāndharva or āsura form both should be made to restore it with interest and that what is expended when the marriage is in the rākşasa or paitāca form the expenditure of stridhana should be dealt with as theft. The meaning of 'mithunam prajātayoḥ' and 'trivarsopa bhuktam' in Kaug. is not quite clear. It is probable that Kautilya lays down a rule of limitation. If more than three years are allowed to pass without complaint, then no complaint made later (than three years after the expenditure ) would be enter tained. So also if there be no children of the marriage and the husband expends strldhana without objection by the wife then also no complaint would be entertained as the restraint on alienation of stridhana by the husband and wife was meant for the benefit and advancement of the children. None of the later smrtis like those of Yaj., Nār. or Kat. makes these distinctions and so Kaut. probably represents an early stage in the evolution of the husband's dominion over stridbana. These later smrtis hold that the husband and wife may be entirely separate as regards their properties and as a general rule the husband's debts, are not binding on the wife's properties nor are the wife's separate debts binding on the husband or his properties (Yaj.

IL. 147 and Kāt.) then he has to return it, that no relation except the husband has any right to use a woman's stridbana during her lifetime even in distress or disease &o. and relies on Manu VIII. 29 which requires the righteous king to award the punishment for theft against such relatives as appropriate the wealth of women. The Sm. C. and V. Mayūkha follow the Mit., but the V. R. and V. O. hold that Kātyāyana's verse applies not only to the husband, but also to the son, father and brothers of the woman. Kat. (912-913 ) provides 1521a that if any one of the four persons (q. in n. 1515 above) forcibly consumes stridhana he should be made to return it with interest and should be also liable to fine (or punishment) and that if any one of these congumes stridhana amicably after securing her consent then he would be liable to return only the principal amount, when he becomes well off (i. e. able to pay ). Devala 1522 also states, if the husband makes a gift of stridhana without cause or enjoys it, he must pay it back with interest, but he may use the stridhana of his wife for relieving the distress of a son (and also of the family, aco. to V. Mayūkba). Kāt. (908) 1523 adds a special rule, 'if the husband has two wives and he does not reside with one of them (1. e. neglects her), he should be forcibly made to return ( the stridhana of his neglected wife ) by the king even though she bestowed it upon him through affection.' The texts of Kat., Devala and Nār. quoted above about the dominion of the woman over her stridhana and about the husband's power over it are

authoritative in all schools even now. Manu IX. 199 1524 provid es: *wives should not spond ( for their own benefit) from the property of their families which is common to many, nor from their own property without the husband's permission.' The V. Mayükha interprets this as meaning that she has no independent power even over adhivedanika and the like, but this would be opposed to the express texts of Kat., Vyasa and Dovala. Therefore the words must be taken as only recommen datory. 

Kāt. (916) delivers a special rule viz. stridhana 1525 which was promised ( to a woman) by her husband should be paid to her as a debt by the sons ( i, e. by her own song or stepsons) provided she resides in the husband's family; she should not reside with her paternal family.' The Sm. C. and V. P. (p. 546) explain that even grandsons and great-grandsons are liable to pay just as sons are. According to Kāt. as understood by the Sm. O. and others a wife who is full of evil acts, is immodest, wastes property and is given up to adultery, does not deserve ( to disposo of stridhana and V. P. and V.O. explain that it may be taken away from her in such a case. 1526 In modern times this rule of forfeiture of rights would not be enforced by the courts as regards stridhana. Some explain this verge as referring to the widow as heir and separate the words as 'stri dhanam. '1527 Vide Ganga v. Ghasita 1 All. 46 (F. B.), 48-49.

Succession to stridhana

on any other. But one thing is generally common to all schools viz. that as regards succession to stridhana daughters are prefer red to sons, though in later days sons were introduced by some writers as heirs along with daughters or even as preferable to daughters for certain kinds of stridhana. This was probably due to the fact that the value of stridhana property became considerable in later times and society which held to the doctrine of the dependence and inferior position of women could not tolerate the idea that large estates should go to women alone. The causes of the variance among writers on the devolution of stridhana are historical. The text-writers wrote at different times and in different countries and probably reflect the popular sentiments of their own countries and times tinged now and then by personal predilections also. The digests sometimes expressly say that their interpretation follows the usage of their times ( vide V. Mayükha in note 1529 below). 

The succession to stridhana varies according as the woman is unmarried or married, according as the marriage was in an approved or an unapproved form, and also according to the species of stridhana and the school of law to which she is subject. 

First, the important texts of the smstis on succession to stridhana may be brought together. The oldest extant text is that of Gaut. 28.22 which provides, 1528 'stridhana devolves (first) on daughters; (in a competition among daughters ) it goes to those that are unmarried (apratta, lit. not given away in marriage ) and ( in a competition among married daughters ) to those that are not well provided for (i. e. that are indigent).' Manu (IX. 192-193 ) provides : 'when the mother dies all the full brothers and full sisters should equally divide the mother's estate. Even to the daughters of those daughters some thing should be given ( that is ) as much as would be seemly out of the estate of their grandmother on the ground of affection'. In Mapu IX. 195 it is said that the six kinds of stridhana, as also anvādheya strldhana and gifts made by the busband through affection, should go to her progeny if she dies in her husband's lifetime. The verses of Manu (IX. 192-3) are variously explained by the commentators, Sarvajña-Nara yana holding that mother's estate means estate other than technical stridbana. Most of them rely on a text of Bṛ. and

hold that full brothers and unmarried sisters succeed together and married sisters (i. e. daughters of the woman whose heirs are to be found) get some trifle (\# of each brother aco, to Kullūka). Manu IX. 196-197 further provide that when a woman was married in one of the five forms of marriage viz. Brahma, Daiva, Arsa, Prajapatya and Gandharva and died without issue her stridhana goes to her husband and if she was married in the Asura and the other two forms it went, if she died issueless, to her mother and father. Yaj. II.1520 117 pro vides that daughters take the stridhana estate of their mother and on failure of them the (male) issue. In II. 1530 144 Yaj. again says that stridhana goes to daughters, but that if the woman dies without issue then it goes to the husband if she was 

married in one of the four forms (brahma, daiva, arsa, praja patya ) but to her parents if she was married in the other four forms. Visnu Dh. S. (17. 19-21) and Nar. ( dayabhāga, 9) contain the same rules as Yaj. II. 144-145, while Nar. (daya bhaga2) states that the mother's wealth should be divided among the daughters and in the absence of daughters the latter's issue takes it. Sankha-Likhita.1531 declare that the mother's estate is taken in equal shares by the full brothers (sons of the deceased mother) and their unmarried sisters. Bç, 1532 (S. B. E.

Devolution of sridhana

33 p. 383 verse 87) declares, 'stridhana goes to her progeny, but the unmarried daughter is preferred, while the married one gets only some trifle as a token of regard'. Parāśara holds that the unmarried daughters take all the stridhana, but in a competition between married daughters alone and sons they all take equal shares. Devala 1533 states, 'on the death of a woman her stridhana is taken in equal shares by her sons and daughters; if she leaves no issue it would be taken by her husband, mother, brother or father'. Pāraskara 1534 (g. by Par. M. III. 552 ) states that stridhana devolves on the unmarried daughter, that the aon does not get it, but that he shares equally with a married daughter. Kauţ. 1535 (111.2 p. 153 ) prescribes that if a woman dies during her husband's lifetime her sons and daughters divide her strldhapa; if she has no son then daughters divide it, on failure (of both sons and daughters) the husband takes it and that the sulka, anvādheya or any other kind of stridhana given by her relatives is taken by her relatives. Kātyāyana 1536 (917-920) whose treatment of stridbana is the most detailed of all smrti writers has the following verses on succession to stridhana: 'Sisters whose husbands are living should share with their brothers the stridhana ( of their mother ); this is the rule of law about stridhana and partition (among brothers and sisters) is prescribed. On failure of daughters the (stridhana) wealth devolves on sons (of the deceased woman); the wealth given to a woman by her kinsmen (paternal or maternal) goes in the absence of the kinsmen (that gave it) to the husband,

(Vol. 

Whatever immovable property was given by the parents to their daughter always goes to her brother if she dies without issue. Whatever wealth was obtained by a woman from her parents in the forms of marriage beginning with agura is declared as going to her parents on failure of her progeny.'1537 The first two verses are apparently in conflict and must be read with Gaut. 28. 22. So probably the following propositions were laid down by Kat. viz. (1) unmarried daughters are preferred; (2) married daughters whose husbands are living share along with their brothers, if there be no unmarried daughter; (3) widowed daughters take only if there are no daughters whose husbands are living or if there are no sons ; (4) wealth given by paternal and maternal kinsmen goes to them and on failure of these, to the husband; (5) immovable property given by parents goes to the brother of the woman on failure of issue; (6) wealth given in the Asura, raksasa and paisāca forms goes to parents on failure of issue. Yama has a verse very similar to Kātyāyana's about a woman married in the asura and the following forms. The commentaries and digests make valiant efforts to reconcile the conflicts among the smrti texts quoted above. It is not quite necessary to go into that question here in detail for fear of encumbering this work too much. 

How the devolution of stridhana was dealt with by the commentators has now to be seen. They all prefer daughters to sons for certain kinds of stridhana. Why the devolution of stridhana property should be different from that of the property of & male is not clearly explained anywhere. The Mit. on Yāj. 1538 II. 117 gives the reason that woman's property goes to the daughter because in her more particles of the mother's body inhere than in the son. Probably the daughters were preferred as heirs to stridhana as a sort of equity, when sons were allowed to exclude daughters in the inheritance to the father's wealth. 

According to the Mit. there are two lines of succession to stridhana, one for sulka and the other for all other kinds of stria dhana. Sulka, aco. to the Mit. that quotes Gaut., devolves first

on the full brothers, then on the mother. 1539 Some like the Subodhini, the Dipakalika, Haradatta on Gaut. 28. 23 hold that it devolves on the mother first and then on the full brothers ; but many works such as the Dayabhaga IV. 3.28 (p. 95), Sm. O., Par, M., V. P., V. C. follow the Mit. It is somewhat strange that the Madanapārijata p. 668 ( which was really composed by the author of the Subodhins in the name of his patron Madanapala, holds that the sulka is first taken by the brothers and then by the mother. This raises a doubt whether the printed Subodhini is correct or whether the author changed his opinion. 

As regards succession to the property of a maiden there is no difference at all between the Mit. and other works. The Mit. quotes a text of Baudhayana 1540 that the wealth of a deceased maidon first devolves on her full brothers, then on the mother and then on the father. The V. P. adds that on failure of the father the maiden's wealth goes to the parents' nearest sapinda.1541 Yaj. II. 146 provides that if a girl who had been promised in marriage dies before marriage, the intending bridegroom was entitled to take back the sulka or other gifts

· The Mitakşard order of succession for all kinds of stridhana, other than sulka and maiden's property, is as foliows: (1) unmarried daughter; (2) married daughter who is indigent; (3) married daughter who is well 

provided for; (4) daughter's daughters ; (5) daughter's Bon; (6) sons; (7) son's sons (here also the rule of per stirpes applies ); (8) husband ( if the woman was married in one of the four approved forns); (9) sapiņdas of the husband in the order of propinquity ; on failure of any sapipda of the husband, her mother, then her father and then the sapindas of the father (before it goes to the Crown). But if the woman was married in one of the unapproved forms, then on failure of her descen dants her stridhana went to her mother, then to her father and then to the father's sapiņdas in the order of propinquity. On failure of the sapiņdas of the father it would (by analogy) go to her husband and then to his sapiņdas ( before going to the Orown). When grand-daughters directly inherit the stridhana of their grandmother they take per stirpes (aco. to the Mit. which quotes Gaut. 28. 15), if they are the daughters of several daughters: 1542. The-Mit. (on Yaj. II. 145), Aparārka (p. 721) and several others provide (following Manu IX. 198= Anusagana 47.25) that if a woman of a lower caste dies issueless leaving stridbana, then the daughter of her co-wife of a higher class inherits that stridbana and on failure of such step-daughter, the son of the latter'inherits. It may be noted that as regards succession to stridhana, the rule of representation which holds good in relation to succession to males does not apply. When a male dies leaving separate property and a son and a grandson (son of & predeceased son). both succeed together, the grandson re presenting his deceased father. But if a woman possessed of stridhapa dies having only a son and a predeceased son's aon; the son will take the whole of the strldhana excluding the son's son Vide Bui Raman vs Jagjivandas 41 Bom. 618. . ::

books having authority in the different provinces will be offer ed. According to the Sm. C. ( which is the leading authority in Madras after the Mit. ) stridhana includes only those kinds of property that are so described in the smrtis ( i. e. only technical stridbana ) and the lines of devolution are as follows: (1) sulka devolves in the same way as laid down by the Mit. cited above (Sm. C. II. p. 287); (2) Yautaka devolves on unmarried daughters first (Sm. O. II. p. 285 ); (3) Anvādheyaka and Bhart;datta pass to sons and married daughters whose husbands are living, all inheriting together in equal shares ( Sm. C. II. p. 284); (4) other kinds of technical stridhana such as adhyagni &o. pags brst to the maiden daughters and married daughters who are apralişthita, 1543 then to married daughters that are provided for; then to daughter's daughters, then to daughter's sons, then to sons, thea to son's sons &c., then to the husband or father (according to the form of marriage ). The Madras High Court follows the Mit. (in preference to the Sm. 0.) as to the devolution of Anvādheyaka and Bhartsdatta and holds that certain kinds of non-technical stridhana (such as gifts by strangers during coverture) devolve acc. to the rules of the Mit: Vide Salemma v. Lutchmana 21 Mad. 100. 

The Vivāda cintamani, the leading authority in Mithila, restricts stridhana to the technical stridhana recognized by the smrtis and lays down the devolution of it as follows: (1) Sulka 1544 ( defined as property received by a woman at the time of her marriage, if in an unapproved form ) passes as under the Mit. cited above; (2) Yautaka passes first to unmarried daughters, then in the way laid down by the Mit. for all stridhana ; (3) all technical stridhana other than the two praceding varieties passes to sons and unmarried daughters together, then to sons and married daughters jointly, then to daughter's daughters, then to daughter's sons and then as under the Mit. system (for stridbana in general.)

Konkan 1545 proposes various lines of succession to stridhana. Its treatment is based on the Sm. C. and the Madanaratna. It first divides stridhana as stated above into technical (paribhaşika) and non-technical ( aparibhāşika ). The first is subdivided into four classes for the purpose of inheritance; (I) sulka which passes as stated above under the Mitakşarā ; (II) yautaka goes to unmarried daughters, ( if there be no unmarried daughters )

Sitabai 3 Bom. 353), that Mahad, the southernmost Taluka of the Kolaba District, is not so governed and that the predominance of the Mayű kha cannot be taken further south than Cheul and Nagothna in the Kolaba District (vide Narhar v. Bhau 40 Bom. 621). Similarly difficult questions arise whether Kathiawar which is quite contiguous to Gujarat and some territory bordering og Gujerat towards the north or east is governed by the views of the Mayukha in preference to those of the Mit. Some parts of Kathiawar which were (and even now are) under the domination of the Gaikwad of Baroda may, on the analogy of the grounds on which the Maya kha is held to be of paramount authority in Gujarat, be deemed to be goverded by the Mayūkba. It appears to me that the tendency of courts should be to restrict the extent of the territory in wbich the Mayūkha is supreme and to bold that everywhere the Mitākṣarā is stipreme, except in those territories where the Mayīkba has been expressly recoginzed as supreme by the feuda tory States contiguous to Gujarat or by judicial decisions. The Mit. is the paramount authority in the whole of India except in Bengal; therefore on the analogy of tho maxim tbat a general role is applicable aod is supreme in all cakes except where an exception clearly covers the matter (Haur PUNTO T

When there is no issue of the woman the succession depends in all cases as under the Mit. on the question whether the woman was married in an approved or an un-approved form. The V. Mayükha employs language somewbat different from that of the Mit. in speaking of the inheritance to stridhana when a woman dies without

In the Dayabhāga school the devolution of various kinds of stridhana according to the Dayabhaga and D. K. S. is as follows: (I) sulka devolves 159 in the following order: (1) full brother, (2) mother, (3) father, (4) husband; (II) Yautaka de volves 1550 in the following order:(1) unmarried and unbetrothed daughters, (2) betrothed daughters, (3). married daughters, who have or are likely to have sons, (4) barren married daughters and childless widowed daughters taking together in equal shares, (5) song, (6) daughter's sons, (7) Bons' sons, (8) son's son's sons, (9) step-son, (10 and 11) stepson's son, stepson's grandson. Then if the marriage was in an approved form, yautaka passed in the absence of any of the above in order to husband, brother, motber and father. If the marriage of the woman was cele brated in an unapproved form then her stridhana passed in order to mother, father, brother, husband.

As regards Ayautaka (i.e. all technical stridhana other than the above three) there is a conflict of authority between the Dayabhaga (IV.2.1-12 pp. 79-81) on the one hand and Raghu nandana and Srikrşna on the other. Acc. to the former the order 1552 is: son and kumūri daughter (or to either on failure of the other); (on failure of both) married daughters that have sons or are likely to have song , son's sons; daughter's sons%3B barren and widowed daughters. But Raghunandana and Sri krsna interpolate sor's son, son's son's son, stepson, stepson's son, stepson's grandson between daughter's sons and barren and widowed daughters. In the decided cases the latter order bag generally been followed.

Bš. says that the mother's sister, maternal uncle's wife, paternal unole's wife, father's sister, mother-in law, elder brother's wife are declared to be like one's mother, that when these women have no aurasa ohild or a son of their co-wife or a daughter's son or & son's son or stepson's son, then the sister's son and the rest may take their wealth. This text, 800, to the Dayabhāga, simply declares that a sister's son and the others may be heirs to the stridbana of the maternal aunt and the rest but the priority is determined among the six heire mentioned above in Bșhaspati's text by the principle of reli gious benefit. Though the sister's son is the first in Bphaspati's text, it is the husband's younger brother who stands really the first among the six if regard is had to the principle of religious benefit. The Vir. (V. P. p. 554 ) states that in the absence of heirs up to the stepson and stepson's sons, the sister's son and the rest (mentioned in Br.) are the heirs to a woman's stri dhana even when sapiņdas like her father-in-law are alive, since mere sapinda relationship would not count when in conflict with a special toxt. It does not appear that the V. P, holds that the six take in the order stated in the text of Br.; 1554 it rather states that among these six the choice of the preferential heir

The above verses of Bṛ. mean that males who are a woman's sister's son or her husband's sister'a son or her husband's brother's son or her owo brother's son or her daugh, ter's husband or her husband's younger brother are like her son and inherit ber stridbana io certain circumstances. 

1554. In Bai Kesserbai v. Hunsraj L, R. 33 I. A. 176 the above text of Brhaspati was discussed in a Bombay case at great length (pp. 190–197) and it was held that under the Mayūkba a co-widow was entitled to sucecod to the stridhana of a widow in preferonce to her busband's brother or bro: tber's son, that the text of Br. must be taken distributively, that is, when the marriage is in an approved form the husband's sister's son will succeed and that when the marriage is in an vnapproved form the brother's son or

would be determined by greater or less propinquity 1555. On failure of these six the husband's sapindas, sakulyas and samānodakas take and then the father's kinsmen. 

The question of an unchaste daughter's succession to stri dhana would be decided in the same way as her succession to her father's property. Under the Dayabhāga an unchaste daughter will not succeed. But under the Mitākşarā as inter preted by modern courts an unchaste daughter who is a kept mistress or a prostitute may succeed but only after virgin daughters or married daughters as the case 1856 may be. The Mit. on Ya. Il 290 relies upon the Skandapurana for the proposition that prostitutes are a fifth caste descended from certain apsarases. 1557 

It has been held by the courts that though prostitution entailed degradation according to ancient Hindu Law, it did not sever the tie of blood. So the stridhana of a naikin ( a dancing girl) or of a married woman who becomes a prostitute may be inherited by her brother or sister or her husband or her husband's relations. 1558 

It may not be out of place here to suggest how stridhana should be dealt with when Hindu Law comes to be codified as it is likely to be in the near future. It may be urged that all distinctions on the ground of sex should be altogether done away with and whenever a woman succeeds to any property whether of a male or of a female she should take an absolute estate. But if this change is opposed by a large volume of opinion as it is quite possible, then it should at least be provided

that all property which a woman Inherits from a female should be her absolute property. Then as regards inheritance to stridhana one simple and straightforward rule should be laid down that the woman's sons and daughters should succeed together taking equal shares. A third suggestion would be that when there are no descendants of the woman herself, then the husband should be the next heir. When the stridbana is that of a maiden, the heirs in order should be her brothers and sisters, then her mother, then her father and after the father the latter's nearest heir. It is not quite necessary at this stage to specify what further rules of devolution should be prescribed. 

CHAPTER XXXI 

MAINTENANCE AND OTHER TOPICS 

The subject of maintenance occupies an important place in modern Hindu Law. A brief statement of the law of the smrtis and the digests on this subject must be made here. 

The liability to provide maintenance for certain persons arises under the ancient Hindu Law in either of two ways viz. (1) on account of bare relationship between the parties or (2) on the ground of the possession of property. A verse 1559 quoted by Medhatithi on Manu III. 7% and IV, 251, by the Mit. on Yāj. 1. 224 and II. 175 and occurring in some mss. of the Manusmrti after XI. 10 provides, 'Manu declares that one must maintain one's aged parents, a virtuous wife and a minor son by doing even a hundred bad acts.' From this verse it follows that irrespective of the possession of property there is a personal legal obligation on the father to maintain his minor son, on the husband to maintain his wife and on the son to maintain his aged parents. Baud. Dh. 8. (II. 2. 48) goes further and provides 1560 that a son is bound to maintain a mother even if she be patita. To the same effect are Āp. Dh. S. I. 10. 28. 9 and Vas. 13. 47.

Luxmibai 2 Bom, 573 (F.B.) at p. 597 (wbicb holds that a Hindu widow voluntarily living apart from her husband's relatives is not entitled to a money allowance as maintenance from them if tbey were separated from him at the time of his death and that she is not entitled to such maintenance from tbem wbether they were separated or unseparated from him at the time of bis death if they have no ancestral estate belonging to him in their hands). The texts of Manu, Yāj. 1. 76 and Nār, are held on p. 598 of that report to impose a personal obligation enforceable by the State, Vide Raja Rama Rao v. Raja of Pittapur 45 1. A. 148 at p. 154 where it is stated that the grandson is not included under the word 'son' and a grandfather is under no personal obligation to maintain a grandson if there is no ancestral property in bis hands. .. 1560.

History of Dharmatastra 

[Vol. Manu VIII. 389 prescribes that the man who abandons and does not maintain his parents, wife and son, when they are not patita, should be fined 600 pams by the king. Nār. also (S. B. E. 33 p. 184 verse 95) provides punishment for such a husband. Yāj. I. 76 states that if a man abandoned a wife who was obedients diligent, the mother of a son and agreeable in speech he was to be made to give one third of his property to the wife and to maintain her, if he had no property. Vişņu Dh. 8. V. 163 made the husband punishable like a thief if he abandoned his blame less wife. Kaut. II. 1 prescribes 1561 that if a man being able fails to maintain his child or wife, parents, minor brothers and sisters, unmarried daughters, widowed daughters, when these are not patita, should be fined twelve panas. These dicta have been followed even by modern courts in India. In Subbarayana v. Subbakka 1562 it has been held that a son is bound to maintain his aged mother whether he has inherited property from his father or not. 

The manager of a joint Hindu family is under a legal obligation to maintain all male members of the family, their wives and children. Nārada states 1563 that if any one among Beveral (undivided ) brothers dies without issue or becomes an ascetio the rest should take the estate and give maintenance to his wives till their death, provided they keep the bed of their husband unsullied but that they may cut off the maintenance If they (wives) behave otherwise. This is because the surviv ing brothers succeed to the estate in which the deceased had an interest during his lifetime. This is made quite clear 1564

Maintenance of widows 

805 

in the Sm. C. explaining a verse of Nar, viz.' widows that are virtuous must be maintained with food and raiment by the eldest brother (of the deceased) or by the father-in-law or by any other gotraja' on which it remarks:: "The words by him who takes the estate'must be understood before all the words such as 'the eldest brother'". Kāt. ( 922 ) states, when the husband goes to heaven the wife is entitled only to food and raiment if he was unseparated or she may set a share in ( ancestral ) property till her death'. The Sm. C. remarks that as maintenance depends upon taking wealth, Kāt. provides two alternatives. In cases too numerous to cite this has been followed by all High Courts. Similarly an heir is bound to maintain out of the estate taken by him those persons whom the deceased was legally or morally bound to maintain. Those persons who are excluded from inheritance or partition are entitled to maintenance and their virtuous wives and unmarried daughters also are entitled to be maintained ( Yaj. II. 140-142 Manu IX. 202, Vas. 17, 54). The Baud. Dh. S. (II. 2. 43-46 ) 1565 provides that those who are past undertaking transactions (i. e. are very old ) should be given food and raiment and also those who are blind, idiotic, impotent, immersed in vice and suffering from ( incurable ) diseases, and those that engage in prohibited acts, except the patila and his issue. Devala ( quoted in the V. Mayukha p. 165 ) has a similar passage, when the father is dead (or even when being alive he makes a partition) the impotent, the leper, the lunatic, the idiot, the blind, an outcast and his offspring, a person wearing a heretical sect mark-these are not entitled to a share of the heritage; to these except the patita food and raiment are to be given'. These persons suffer from a personal disqualification and maintenance is given to them in lieu of a share not because their status is denied but because they are incapable of management and enjoyment of property. Vide Raja Ram Rao v. Raja of Pittapur. 1566 

The general principle is that an heir is legally bound to provide outrof the estate taken by him as heir maintenance for those persons, male or female, whom the late owner was morally or legally bound to maintain. For example, if there is no ancestral property the father-in-law, who possesses only self

soquired property is not legally bound to maintain his daughter in-law ( widow of a predeceased son); but on the death of the father-in-law, his heir i. e, son, widow, or daughter would be legally bound to maintain a widowed daughter-in-law. 1566a The Bombay High Court, however, adds the condition that the predeceased son must have been in union with his father when he died ; vide 23 Bom. 608. 

By Act XVIII of 1937 it has been provided that in a family governed by the Mitakşarā the widows of deceased copardeners such as the daughter-in-law and the grand-daughter-in-law are entitled to their husband's interest. The Act does not expressly state that their rights to maintenance are taken away. In many cases such widows may prefer to take a share instead of being allotted only maintenance and so far the law of mainten ance will tend to become obsolete. 

Another important question is what is the effect of uncha stity on the right to maintenance ? As regards the wife's right to maintenance and the effect of unchastity thereon during the busband's lifetime, vide H. of Dh. vol. II pp. 571-73 above. Manu XI. 176 says that a wife guilty of adultery should be confined by the husband in the same house and should be made to undergo the same penance as a man guilty of adultery has to undergo; Yāj I. 70 also says that a wife guilty of adultery should be deprived of her status as a wife as to wealth and religious observances, should be given bare maintenance and should be confined to a part of the house. Unohastity on the part of a Hindu widow disentitles her to maintenance under certain circumstances Vas. 21. 10 provides that four classes of wives must be abandoned viz. one who yields herself to her husband's pupil or to his guru and especially one who attempts the life of her husband or who commits adultery with a man of a degraded caste and in 21. 12 Vasiştha states that the wives of brahmaņas, ksatriyas and vaibyas, who commit adultery with a sūdra, may be purified by penance if no child is born ( of the adulterous intercourse) but not otherwise'. It is provided by Yaj. I. 72 that if a woman ( of the three higher castes ) conceives through adultery with a südra or kills her foetus or attempts the death of her husband or is guilty of grave sins (such as brahmana-murder ) she shall be abandoned.

Maintenance and unchastity 

801 

Manu IX. 188 provides that when women beoomr patita, the rite callad ghatasphota (the procedure of which may be seen at P. 388 of the H. of Dh. vol. II and in note 1168 in the Appendix to this volume ) may be performed, but they must be given food and raiment and they must be provided with a hut near the family house. Yaj. III. 296 has a similar provision. The result is that there is no text which provides that a widow who is once unchaste must be deemed unchaste for ever and must for ever forfeit her olaim even to a starving snaintenance even if she repents, reforms her ways and gives up an immoral life. On the contrary the texts say that widows guilty of adultery are purified by penance and may be restored to all their social privileges. For example, Manu 1567 XI. 189 says generally about all persons that after they perform the appropriate prüyascitta, they should not be rebuked or avoided (but should be restored to all social intercourse ). The Mit. on Yaj. I. 72 expressly says that the abandonment of oven such women as are referred to in that verse consists in not associating with them conjugally and in religious matters, but does not mean that they are to be driven out of the house. 1568 

On Yaj. III. 297 ( which states that in the case of women there are three peculiarly grave sine piz, adultery with a low caste man, killing the foetus and attempt to murder the husband) the Mit. sumg up the whole position as follows: (1) total abandonment of women for the four grave sius laid down in Vas. 21. 10 takes place when they do not perform penance; (2) women guilty of adultery not of the aggravated kind mentioned in Vas. 21. 10 are to be given starving maintenance that would keep body and soul together and are to be lodged in & hut near the house and to be afforded protection (Yaj. I. 70 and III. 296 ), even if they do not perform the requisito penance. But the Mit. is silent as to the claim to maintenance of widows that at first led a life of incontinence ( but not of the aggrava ted kind) and subsequently reformed their ways. But from Manu XI. 189 it may be inferred that widows not guilty of

aggravated adultery that have undergone the proper prayascitta and that return to decent life would have been entitled to ordinary maintenance from the period they turned over a new leaf. 1569 

A brief reference to the modern case law on this point may be made here. In Bhikubai v. Hariba 1870 Sir Lallubhai Shah ( after an elaborate examination of ancient and medieval authorities and decided cases ) hield that a widow who had been unchaste, but who is proved to have given up the life of un chastity is entitled to baro maintenance. In Lakhmichand v. Anandi the Privy Council make the general observation : 1571 It is true that the right of a Hindu widow to maintenance is conditional upon her leading a life of chastity and that she loges that right if she becomes unchaste'. In Kisanji v. Lakshmi 1572 it was held that subsequent unchastity disentitled a widow from recovering maintenance, even though it is claim able under an agreement made with the deceased husband's father and brother. In Musammat Ganga v. Ghasita 1 All. 46 (F. B.) it has been held that unchastity does not incapacitate a daughter from inheriting stridhana. In Angammal v. Venkata 26 Mad. 509 the same rule was laid down. 

The illegitimate son born of a sūdra concubine to a man of the three higher castes appears to have been held entitled to maintenance from very early times. Gaut. 28. 37 provides, *the son from a sūdra woman of a man (of the three higher varpas ) who is without issue receives maintenance (lit, source of maintenance ), if he is obedient, in the same way as a pupil might receive'. And Gautama (28.43) extends the same rule to the offspring of pratiloma unions. Vide p. 601 above and note 1135 for the text of Gaut. and Br. on the point. Manu IX.

Maintenance of an illegitimate son 

809. 

155 also provides that the son of a man of the three higher castes from & sūdra woman (not married to him) is not entitled to share in the ancestral estate. Bp. (8.B.E. 33 p. 374 v. 31 ) states 1573 that an obedient and meritorious son born from a woman of the šūdra caste to a man who has no other child should get main tenance and that the sapiņdas should divide the rest of the wealth of the deceased. Both the Mit. and the V. Mayükba, while explaining Yaj. II. 133-134 about the rights of the illegitimate son of a sūdra from a šūdra woman, remark that one who is begotten on a dāsi 1574 by a member of the regenerate classes is not entitled to a share even at the father's choice nor to a half share after his father's death but that he is only ontitled to maintenance. 1575 

There is a good deal of case law on this subject, but much of it is irrelevant in this treatise. The right of maintenance attaches in the first instance to the separate property of the putative father and if the latter leaves no such property but was a member of a joint family it attaches to the property of the joint family of which the putative father was a member. 1576 It has further been held that it does not matter if the woman was not a dāsi (a slave ) or a permanent concubine in the exclusive keeping of a man or that the intercourse was adult erous. 1577 It has been also held that the illegitimate son's right to maintenance is a personal right and cannot be transmitted to his son 1578 and that maintenance has to be provided for him till his death 1579 (and not merely up to his attaining majority),

except in Bengal. 158 The fact that the texts employ the word " südrāputra" (in the masculine gender) has been interpreted by the decided cases as involving that an illegitimate daughter is not entitled under Hindu Law to maintenance. Vide Parvati v. Ganpatrao 1581 and Vellaiyappa v. Natarajan. 1582 

Another frequent subject of litigation in modern times hag been a concubine's right of maintenance under the Hindu Law, It has been held that a concubine has no legal right to claim maintenance from her paramour during the latter's lifetime, as he can discard her at any time and as she cannot compel him to keep her. 1583 So also a Hindu is not entitled to transfer joint family property to a concubine for her maintenance during his lifetime. 1584 But on the death of the paramour a great difference is made in the rights of a concubine that was in his exclusive keeping till his death. Such a concubine has been held to possess a legal right to maintenance payable out of the estate, ancestral or self-acquired as the case may be, in the hands of those who take it after the death of the paramour. The rights of women, who are not wives, to maintenance are based mainly on two texts, viz. of Nārada and Kātyāyana, that are explained in the Mit., the V. Mayukha and other medieval works. Narada says : 1585 ' A king devoted to dharma should give maintenance to the women ( stri) of a deceased person (when the king succeeds as heir by escheat), except when the deceased person is a brāhmana'; while Kāt. (931 ) states, 1586 " heirless property goes to the king after keeping aside ( wealth sufficient to provide ) for the women (yosit), the dependents (or servants ) and the funeral rites and sraddhas (of the deceased)'.

Kaut, algo similarly prescribes (HII, 1587 5. p. 161 ), the king takes heirless property except that of Srotriyas, setting apart ( wealth ) for the maintenance of women ( of the deceased), for funeral rites and for poor or wretched (dependents of the deceased). The Mit., the V. Mayükha, the Par. M. and others state that the verses of Nār. and Kāt, refer to avaruddha. stri alone, since the word patni ( duly wedded wife ) does not occur therein, but only the words 'yoşit' and 'stri '. 1586 There has been a great divergence of views in the decided cases about the significance of avaruddha stri. It is generally rendered as 

a concubine or mistress in the exclusive keeping of a person till the latter's death'. Several conditions are necessary to constitute a woman an avaruddha stri capable of claiming maintenance from the estate of her deceased paramour in the hands of his sons or other heirs. In the first place, she must have been continuously and exclusively in his keeping till his death. How long she should have been thus in his keeping cannot be fixed by any hard and fast rules. She must have been so long in his keeping continuously till his death that it can be said that the connection had become permanent. In Bai Nagubai v. Bai Monghibai a period of five years was deemed to be sufficient. In the second place the concubine 1589 must observe sexual fidelity to her deceased paramour after bis death in order to be able to claim maintenance from the estate in the hands of his heirs or successors. In Bai Monghibai v. Bai Nagubai 1590 a third condition was laid down yiz, that the con nection of the concubine with the deceased paramour should be perfectly open and recognized and she must have been kept practically as a member of the family. But in Bai Nagubai v. Bai Monghibai 1591 the Privy Council overruled the above deci sion and held that in order to entitle a mistress to maintenance it is not necessary that she should have resided in the same

sen overtuinoids that are the estate 

house with the deceased together with his wife and the ordinary members of his family. And in Dayavati v. Kesarbai 1592 it was further held that the concubine need not prove that she was recognized by the family of the deceased or that his relationsbip with her was known to the family. A further restriction was imposed by the case of Anandilal 1. Chandralai 1593 that the intercourse with the paramour should not have been adulterous. But this case has been overruled by a recent Full Bench deci. sion in Alcku v. Ganesh 1594 which holds that a permanently kept concubine is entitled to be maintained out of the estate of her deceased paramour, although she has a husband living ( who was examined in the cage as a witness ), provided she observes sexual fidelity to the deceased paramour after his death. It becomes, therefore, necessary to examine the Sanskrit medieval commentaries and digests in order to arrive at a correct inter pretation of the expression 'avaruddha stri', Strangely enough, the Mit does not define the word in the section on dayabhāga, but only under stri-sangrahapa'. Yaj. II. 290 provides,' a man should be awarded a fine of fifty panas, if he has intercourse with disis that are avaruddhā or that are bhujipya and also (other women such as prostitutes and svairinis ), even though ordinarily they (i: e. dāsis and others ) are approachable (with out incurring the consequence of punishment). The Mit. explains that the word 'ca' placed after 'bhujisyāgu' in Yāj. II. 290 is meant to include vesyas and svairiņis along with bhuji gyās. Acc. to the Mito the verse prescribes the same fine for intercourse with three kinds of women, viz. dāsis that are ava ruddha, dāsis that are bhujisyā and other women such as vesyās (who are ordinarily approachable by all males of their own or higher castes) and svairinis ( who abandon their husbands and resort at their desire to some other male of their own caste, as defined by Yāj. I. 67). A woman though originally a veryū or a svairini may be known to be kept by a man. In that case if another man approaches her, Yāj. II. 290 declares that he would be liable to be fined in the same amount as if he approached an avaruddha dasi or bhujişyā, because being in the keeping of another at the time she would be like a wife ( as the other two classes do ) so far as punishment for approaching a kept woman is concerned.

of women at all. The Mit: here defines 'avaruddha dasl' as "a slave woman who is prohibited by her master from intercourse with other men with an order to stay in the master's house alone in order that there may be no loss of attendance ( on the mas ter )." The Mit. defines a bhujisyū dāsi as one who is restricted (as to enjoyment) to certain definite males' (purusaniyata-pari grahā bhujisyah ). 1595 It is worthy of note that the Mit. employs different phraseology in defining the two words. In defining a bhujisyā it employs the word 'niyata', which generally means 'fixed or definite', while in defining 'avaruddha' it employs the word 'niruddhaḥ' meaning "prevented or prohibited'. If the two words were intended to convey the same meaning, there is no reason why the Mit. should not have employed the same word (niruddha) in defining a bhujisya. The difference between an avaruddhā dāsi and a bhujisya is that the former is ordered to stay in the master's house, while the bhujisya is not 80 ordered and secondly the avaruddha is forbidden to have sexual intercourse with any one except the master, while the bhujişyā is not so forbidden, but she is to restrict herself to 

enjoyment by certain specified males ( friends or men of the master's family ) and not necessarily by the master alone, This is the meaning assigned to those words by Mitramitra in his commentary 1596 (not his digest) on Yāj. II. 290. The Mit. itself indicates the meaning of 'niyata'by saying elsewhere that owner ship springs from certain fixed sources (niyatopāyakain svatram on Yaj. II. 114). It is respectfully submitted that the Privy Council gave a wrong interpretation of the word 'avaruddha' in Bai Nugubai vi Bai Monghibai 1597. Though slavery is now abolished in India there is no reason why the two characteris tics of avaruddha (viz, staying in the master's house and being

exclusively kept by the master) stated by the Lit. should not have been strictly adhered to by the Privy Council, particularly when they were holding heirs liable for the maintenance of kept mistresses, which is hardly ever allowed in any other system of law. With the greatest respect to the Full Bench, it must be said they went wrong in holding that bhujisyā means *a mistress who is restrained from intercourse with other per sons (other than the master)' and in holding that the only distinction between an araruddhā and a bhujisyā is that the former is required to stay in the house of the paramour, while the latter is not ( 47 Bom. L. R. at pp. 13 and 22). The learned judges have not correctly interpreted the word 'niyata' and also the explanation of 'bhujigya' given by the Balambhatti 1598. The meaning of the Bālambhatti was misunderstood on account of the wrong meaning attached to the word 'niyata'. What the Balambhatti means in explaining the definition of bhujiaya is 'one who is to be enjoyed by certain definite males only other than the master (i. e. by the master and also certain defined males) and it does not mean 'who is forbidden to be enjoyed by males other than the master'. 

The F. B. further rely upon a passage of the Mit. in support of their conclusion ( 47 Bom. L. R. at pp. 14 and 22). On the question of what properties are impartible, the Mit. on Yāj. II. 119 quotes Manu IX. 219 viz. 'clothes, conveyances, ornaments, cooked food, water (wells &c.), women, yogakşema and pastures (or ways)--these they der are are impartible.'The Mit. explanation1599 of the word ' striyah 'may be translated as follows: *striyah' here means 'fomaie slaves ; if they are uneven in number they should not be divided by taking their price into consideration, but they are to be made to work in turns (for the separated members of the family ), but as regards women kept by the father such as svairinis and the rest, they are not to be divided by the sons even though they be even in number". It is difficult to see how this passage supports the Full Bench decision. That

Meaning of avaruddha 

815 

passage can be explained in two or three different ways. In the first place, the Mit. having itself clearly distinguished and defined three classes, viz. avaruddha, bhujigya and svairinis ( together with vośyas also ) it cannot be lightly supposed that elsewhere it gives up that distinction. Therefore it would be difficult to say that here ( on Yāj. II. 119 ) the Mit, means that svairinis are also the same as avaruddhās. Hence the inter pretation should be that women who are avaruddha ( kept exclusively by the father) and even other women also like svairipis ( who had sexual connection with the father though not as avaruddhā ) should not be divided i. e. a 'ca' should be understood after 'svairinyadyah'. Or it is possible to hold that the word ' avaruddha ' in that passage is not employed in the strict technical sense (as defined by the Mit. on Yaj. II. 290 ). but in its etymological sense meaning 'women who are svairinis and the like that are taken into his harem (or under his protec tion ) by the father should not be divided'. This interpretation derives support from the explanation offered by the Subodhini (which is repeated almost verbatim by the Balambhatti ) about the text of Gautama quoted by the Mit. that 'gamyukta' in Gaut. means 'enjoyed' or 'confined' (in the house ). This shows that the words 'ruddha' and 'avaruddha' were used in the etýmological sense be distinguished writers. The Sm. C. II. p. 321 while explaining the word ' ruddha' in Manu IX. 12 applied to a wife guilty of adultery explains it as mean ing 'confined in a part of the house (grhe avaruddhām). When the Mit. states (p. 811) that the verses of Nār, and Kat. refer to avaruddhā stri it follows that these verses do not refer to bhujisyā, who would therefore be deemed not entitled to maintenance at all.

These are not quite germane to thọ present. volume, particularly because most of the decisions on these

(Vol. 

matters are not based on the words of the smộtis or of the medieval digests, but are based on logic and principles of justice and equity. But there is one matter which deserves & passing reference. Ancient Hindu Law, attached the highest spiritual importance to the payment of debts ( vide pp. 414-417 above ). Therefore debts contracted by a Hindu are held by the Courts to take precedence over the right of maintenance of a man's wife, his infant child or his widow after his death. 1600 Similarly debts contracted by the manager of the joint family of which the widow's husband was a member would take precedence over the widow's right of maintenance, provided the debts were for the benefit of the family or were for legal necessity. 

The last vyauhārapadu is prakirnalca, which is defined by Visņu Dh. S. 42. 1 as 'miscellaneous' (yadanuktam tat pra kirņakam ) or by Nār. as matters that were to be set in motion by the king himself (vide note 331 ). These have been dealt with above and do not require any further treatment here. 

At the end of this section ou Vyavahāra it would not be out of place to say a few words about wille. Owing to the joint family system and the custom of adoption testamentary dis positions did not come into vogue in ancient India. Among the many kinds of documents (lekhya) mentioned by Kaut., Bộ., Kāt. and others cited above there is no term for a document which can convey the idea of a modern will. But it need not be supposed that the idea had not at all dawned upon the minds of people before the advent of the British 1601 Wills were known among Mahomedans and contact with them would naturally suggest the idea of a will. Oral or written instructions by a man expecting death to his heirs intended to affect the disposal of his property must have been given occasionally and should not

be supposed to have been entirely unknown. Verses 341-359 of the Rajatarangipi IV. appear to embody the political testament of king Lalitāditya of Kashmir in the first half of the 8th century. Kat. (566) makes a very near approach to the modern conception of a will 1602. He says, 'if a gift was promised by a man for a religious purpose whether when in good health or when afflicted with disease, the son should be made to pay it, if the father dies without giving it over.' Here the mere declara-. tion of the intention of a person was made enforceable after his death against the son or other heir. Bphaspati's verse saying that a promise or direction to take effect after the death of the promisor was not ordinarily enforceable has already been quoted above (n. 823 ). In the quarterly of the Bhārata-itihāsa. samsodhaka Mandala of Poona, vol. XX p. 210 (for May 1940 ) there is a letter ( dated 1775 A.

[ Vol. 

One of the earliest wills to come before the British Indian Courts was that of the notorious Umichand 1605 (who died in. 1758 A. D.). Bengal Regulation XI of 1793 recognized by section VI the power of a Hindu proprietor to make a will or declaration giving, prior or subsequent to 1st July 1794, his entire landed estate to his eldest son or next heir or other son or heir or to any person or persons. In a Bombay case the will of a Hindu nmade in 1789 is referred to 1605. A Pundit of the Recorder's court of Bombay gave it as his opinion in 1812 A.D., there is no mention of wills in our Shaster; therefore they ought not to be made' ( vide Strange's Hinda Law, vol. II p. 449 ). In I. L. R. (1940) 1 Cal. 415 at p. 424 the Privy Council observe that the Hindu will in its present form is a developnient since the middle of the 18th century. 

. It is beyond the scope of this work to dilate on the modern Acts dealing with Testamentary dispositions such as the Indian Succession Act (Act 39 of 1925 ). 

Now that the foregoing lengthy presentation of the ancient and medieval Hindu judicial procedure and substantive law has been brought to a close a few general observations may be indulged in here. The Hindu Law of pleading and evidence compares favourably with similar laws of many other countries and has extorted the admiration and encomiums of such

eminent Jurists and Judges as Sir William Jones, Sir Thomas Strange and others. For example, Sir Thomas Strange in * Hindu Law '(1830) vol. I observes ( at p. 311), "sufficient be it to observe that Hindu pleading was noticed with commendation by Sir William Jones and that, with some trifling exceptions, the Hindu doctrine of evidence is, for the most part, distin guished nearly as much as our own, by the excellent sense that determines the competency and designates the choice of wit nesses with the manner of examining and the credit to be given them; as well as by the solemn earnestness with which the obligation of truth is urged and inculcated; insomuch that less cannot be said of this part of their law than that it will be read by every English lawyer with a mixture of admiration and delight, as it may be studied by him to advantage. Even the pious perjury which it has been supposed to sanction1605a being resolvable after all into no greater liberty than what our juries (not indeed with perfect approbation) have long been allowed to take, where the life of a prisoner on trial before them is at stake; credit is to be given to the pregnant brevity of the Hindu oath yiz.'what you know... declare at large and with truth'(Manu VIII. 80 ); as also to the noble warning, with which the subject as detailed by Manu is ushered in, that'either the court must not be entered by judges, parties and witnesses or law and truth must be openly declared' (Manu VIII. 13 )." The medieval digests made a very near approach to the modern ideal of equality of all men before the law. How even in the 20th century the much vaunted equality before the law of all people in England is far from being achieved and how it often proves quite illusory where the poor or the labouring classes are concerned is well brought out in a book entitled 'Justice in England' by a Barrister published by Victor Gollancz in 1938, especially in chapters I and VI. The Hindu jurists evolved tolerably clear and sound ideas about contracts, debts, deposits and pledges, sales, mortgages and gifts of immovable properties, developed a system of joint fanily rights and liabilities and laid down a peculiar law of inheritance and succession to males and females. The Hindu* system of inheritance and succession

pursues a middle course. It does not distribute the estate of a deceased person simultaneously among several heirs as under the Mahomedan Law (where the widow, the father, mother, song and daughters of a man take the estate together if they are all alive at the time). Nor did the Hindu system confine the descent to a single person among a group of heirs of the same degree and sex as in the English system before 1926 ( where the eldest son succeeded to the real estate of an intestate person). 

It has further been seen how the ancient and medieval Hindu rules as to debts, adoption, partition and inheritance have been moulded for over a century by Legislation and by decisions of the Privy Council and the Courts in India. Many persons feel that the time has now arrived for the codification of Hindu Law. A Committee presided over by Sir B. N. Rau has prepared a draft code which attempts to codify certain branches of Hindu Law. From several quarters there has been vehement opposition to this draft code. The objections raised are many. It is not possible to deal here with the several objections in detail. But some of them which raise questions of fundamental importance will have to be briefly stated and answered. The first objection is that in view of Queen Victoria's proclamation of 1858 the Indian Legislature should not interfere with the oustoms and usages of the people that are part and parcel of the Hindu religious system. But this objection is hollow and unsubstantial and conveniently ignores what has happened during the last hundred years or so. All that the Queen pro claimed was: 'Firmly relying ourselves on the truth of Christianity and aoknowledging with gratitude the solace of religion we disclaim alike the right and the desire to impose our convictions on any of our subjects. We desire it to be our royal will and pleasure that none be in any wise favoured, none molested or disquieted by reason of their religious faith or observances; but that all shall alike enjoy the equal and impartial protection of the law; and we do strictly charge and enjoin all those who may be in authority under us that they abstain from all interference with the religious belief or worship of any of our subjects on pain of our highest displeasure.' Not withstanding the noble sentiments expresged here, the Indian Legislature both before and after the proolamation passed numerous laws that more or less impinged upon or affected the religious theories, sentiments and practices of millions of Hindus! The following is a list of some of the important laws of this character which will convince any one of the fact that 

11) 

Laws affecting ancient Hindu practices 

821 

people have always submitted to laws passed by the Governor General or the Legislature that prevented them from carrying out their cherished ideas and practices : Regulation XVII of 1829 which declared the practice of Sati illegal and a crime punishable by the courts; the Caste Disabilities Removal Act (XXI of 1850 ); Hindu Widows' Remarriage Act ( XV of 1856, which legalises the marriages of Hindu widows notwithstanding any custom or interpretation of the Hindu Law to the contrary); the Indian Penal Code (XLV of 1860, which makes sexual inter course by a man with his own wife that is under thirteen years of age punishable as rape ); the Child Marriage Restraint Act (XIX of 1929), which makes the marriage of a male below 18 and of a female below 14 punishable as a crime; the Hindu Inheri tance (Removal of Disabilities) Act (XII of 1928) which sets aside the Mitākşarā rules about exclusion from partition and inherit ance except in the case of those that have been lunatics or idiots from birth; the Hindu Law of Inheritance Amendment Act ( II of 1929, which enables the son's daughter, daughter's daughter, sister and sister's son to succeed under the Mitākşarā in that order after the paternal grandfather and before & father's brother); the Hindu Gains of Learning Act ( XXX of 1930 ); the Hindu Women's Rights to Property Act (XVIII of 1937, which enables the widow of a deceased member of a joint Hindu family to succeed to the interest of her husband in the joint family property and to succeed to her deceased husband's separate property for the same share as that of a son). The Privy Council claimed more than 70 years ago that the British Government by virtue of its sovereign power asserted, as the former rulers of the country had done, the right to visit endowments of this kind ( viz. temples) and to provent and redress abuses in their management' ( Rajah Muttu Ramalinga v. Perianayagum 1 1. A. 209 at p. 232 ). Non-Hindu Judges of the Privy Council and the High Courts have been interpreting and laying down the Hindu Law for over a hundred years and on many points the law declared by them has thoroughly changed the law of the smrtis and digests. If all this has been allowed to happen without hardly & demur, there is apparently no satisfactory or convincing reason why an elected Indian Legisla ture the majority of whose members are likely to be Hindus should not pass an Aot dealing with Hindu Law. 

Another objection raised oven by some retired judges of the High Court is that the present system of laying down the822 

History of Dharmatāstra 

( Vol. 

Hindu Law by means of judicial decisions is quite satisfactory and there is no need of a code of Hindu Law. This objection merely shows that change is rather a painful process for most mon. The present method may be a veritable El Dorado or paradise for lawyers and busy bodies fonenting longdrawn litigations. One must stand appalled at the colossal expendi ture of time, labour and money which must have been involved during the last hundred years or more in fighting out doubtful points of Hindu Law from the lowest court to the Privy Council. It not unfrequently happens that after a point had been settled by a Full Bench decision of a High Court and after common people and lawyers had followed the law thus settled for fifty years the Privy Council upsets the decision on an appeal by an enterprising litigant. For example, the Bombay High Court decided in 1879 in Ramji 1. Ghamau (6 Bom. 498 ) that the adop tion by the widow of a deceased co-parcener, who had not her husband's express authority to adopt, was invalid, if made with out the consent of the surviving co-parceners. But in 1932 the Privy Council held that Ramji v. Ghamau was wrongly decided and that a widow can adopt without her husband's express authority and even in the teeth of the opposition of the sur viving members of her husband's family. And when an appeal was made to the principle of 'stare decisis' the Privy Council was pleased to observe, ' It was pressed on their Lordships that Ramji v. Ghamau had been accepted and acted upon in the Presidency of Bombay since 1879 and that the decision should not be disturbed. But this is a belated appeal. It should have been made when Yadav v. Namdeo was before the Board.' To ordinary minds this dictum, speaking with the utmost régpect, appears strange. If for some reason or other a certain line of argument is not placed before the Privy Council by the counsel of a private party and a wrong decision is given, is it to be supposed that all litigants are to be precluded from trying to get the wrong decision right for all time to come! The Privy Council has not seldom set right a wrong decision given by the Board in a prior appeal. In Sahu Ram v. Bhup Singh 44 I. A. 126 the Privy Council held that the pious duty of the son to discharge his father's or grandfather's debts does not attach while the father or grandfather is alive; but in Brý Narain v. Mangla Prasad 51 I. A. 129 the Privy Council held (at p. 134) that the pious duty is always there irrespective of the question whether the father or grandfather is alive or dead.

Draft Hindu code , 

823 

Others opine tbat one Code for the whole of India is not and cannot be a practicable proposition. In support of their objection they rely on the existence of the several schools of law now prevalent in the whole of India. If India desires to be a self-governing political unity in the future, there is a com pelling reason why it should be governed by a single Code of Hindu Law, as it has been gov erned and will be governed in other substantial provinces of law by codes applicable to all alike. That will help in the direction of solidarity and will be of some use in doing away with fissiparous tendencies. There are really only two schools of Hindu Law. And the unification of Hindu Law will be helped by the abolition of the right by birth which is the cornerstone of the Mitakşarā school and which the draft Hindu Code seeks to abolish. Many people are vehemently opposed to the change. But they forget that: what with the rule that any member of a joint Hindu family may alienate his interest for value, what with the Gains of Learning Act, the Hindu Women's Rights to Property Act and other enactments, the real core of the ancient Hindu family system has been removed and only the outer moribund shell remains (vide p. 604 above). Some are opposed to giving along with sons a share to daughters, particularly to married daugh ters. But here a compromise may be effected by allowing a share to unmarried daughters alone (as Yāj. II. 124 and the Mitākşarī thereon expressly provide ). 

Another provis ion in the draft Hindu Code which has come in for severa anim adversion is the provision that a woman even when taking by inheritance an estate from a male or by partition should be held to become absolute owner thereof. In the first place, if a man's agnate of the 13th degree or a male cognate up to the 5th degree takes an estate absolutely and may squander it away as he pleases, one fails to see why his own widow should not have a like power in the 20th century, what ever may have been the view of ancient works. In the second place, this objection can be met by means of a compromise, viz. that a widow inheriting her husband's estate will take only a limited estate if at the time of her husband's death any one of the compact series of heirs or any direct lineal descendant of her husband (such as a son's daughter or daughter's daughter) be alive, but she will take an absolute estate if none of these exists. Such a compromise should allay all fears about the widow unfairly disposing of the estate against near relations 

824 

History of Dharmadastra 

( Vol. 

like the daughter or daughter's son or husband's brother &c. There are numerous other objections, but they are in matters of detail and if once it is agreed that there should be a Code of Hindu Law passed by the Indian Legislature these matters of detail may be adjusted to the satisfaction of most people. 

Similarly serious objections are raised to the provisions of the Code as regards marriages and divorce. The draft code proposes to do away with the prohibitions based on sameness of gotra and pravara. This is a desirable change and being optional should not be opposed. Some reasons for this change have been advanced in H. of Dh. vol. II. p. 498. Besides, this provision will affect only a small percentage of the Hindu popu. lation. Similarly the insistence on monogamy is opposed by many. In this case some compromise may be arrived at as regards classes to whom two wives are an economic advantage. The provisions about divorce have been overdue. Among the higher castes no divorce has been allowed on any ground what ever. Many hard cases occur where there is no redress and the draft code proposes to give relief in such cases. 

On the most contentious subject of adoption the draft code, it is satisfactory to note, has made certain provisions which are in line with the suggestions put forth by me in note 1338a above. 

Compelling reasons exist why Hindu Law should be codi fied as early as possible. Men naturally desire that they should have easy access to the laws by which they are to be governed in all their actions, dealings and relations. It is hardly a commendable or desirable state of things that-people should be forced to consult lawyers or bulky textbooks every now and then and even in small and simple matters. The general outlines and provisions of Hindu Law must be within easy reach of every intelligent or inquiring Hindu. This can only happen if there is a code for all Hindus or, if that is deemed impracticable for the present, at least for a large pro vince or for a number of provinces,

From Gautama 1606 downwards many writers dilate upon the sources of dharma. Gautama. I. 1-2 states: ' the Veda is the source ( mula) of dharma and also the tradition (or smộtis ) and practice of those who know the Veda'. Similarly Ap. Dh. S. (I. 1. 1.1-%) says: 'we shall propound the acts (that produce merit) which are evolved from conventions and practices; the authority ( for finding out the dharmas) are the conventions of those who know the dharma and the Vedas'. Vas. I. 4-7 pro vides: 'dharma is declared by the Vedas and Smptis; on failure of these two the practice of the sistas is the authority (for finding out what dharma is); a sista however is one whose heart is free from (worldly ) desires and (only ) such acts of sigtas are ( to be held as ) dharma for which no ( worldly

or secular ) cause (or motive) can be assigned'. 1607 Manu II. 6 and Yaj. I. 7 declare that Veda (or sruti), smrti and the practices of the good are the principal sources of dharma. The words employed in these works are fila, samaya, ācāra or sadācāra or sistācāra 1607 (the latter three meaning the game thing ). Ap. employs both words viz. samaya and ācāra, the first of which probably means 'agreement or convention or usage', while the latter means 'custom'. The word 'custom' now conveys the idea of some antiquity, 1608 while usage or convention does not necessarily convey that idea. A usage may be recent or it may be established by agreement among a certain class of persons ( such as traders or craftsmen ). We have to see what is meant when it is said that ācāra or šiştācāra or sadācāra is the source (mūla) of dharma. An indication of the meaning is furnished by the word pramīna employed by Ap. and Vas. The meaning is that just as the revealed books (Veda) and the smrtis authoritatively lay down what dharma is, so also in our quest to find out what dharma is in the varying circumstances of life the practices of those who may be called sistas furnish us with the necessary criterion or norm i. e. $iştācāra is the touchstone for judging whether an act is in consonance with what the Šāstras require us to do. The theory of the ancient writers was that the smrtis were based on parts of Veda ( that consists of mantras and Brāhmaṇa texts ) which though formerly existent are not now extant or available, that similarly the practices of those who were learned in the Vedas and were deemed to be šistas must be inferred to have been based on portions of Veda not now available. This theory was advanced by such ancient

writers as Āp. 1609 and was taken up by many subsequent works. Manu II. 7 also states that whatever dharma has been ordained for any person by Manu, all that has been entirely declared in the Veda for the Veda is full of all knowledge. But it does not follow from this nor is it ever meant that all practices of bistas are authoritative in matters of dharma. The qualifica tion was added that where the practices of sistas are clearly referable to or are prompted by a seen motive or by the desire to secure pleasure, there they are not authoritative. Manu (II. 18 ) restricted the word sadācāra to the customs handed down from generation to generation among the four varnas and the mixed castes in the country called by him Brahmā varta ( II. 17). But many other writers did not so restrict it in this way, 

We have to distinguish between what are called the sources (müla or pramāņa ) of dharma and the sthānas of dharma (Yaj. I 3 and 7), 1610 The former indicate to the inquiring spirit what dharma is (i.e. they are what are called jñāpaka hetu ), while the latter must be studied as aids by the expounders of dharma in order to correctly grasp what dharma is, i.e. the different lores (other than Veda and smrti ) are not directly the sources of dharma, but are only mediately so. This distinc tion is an ancient one as even Gautama XI. 19 provides that the king is helped in his administration of justice by the Veda, the dharmaśāstras, the auxiliary lores ( angas), the Upavedas and the Purāņa. 1611

detailed consideration. In I. 3. 1-2 1612 Jaimini considers the question whether such smrti injunctions as one should perform the Astaka sraddhas',1613 or 'one should construct a tank or set up a prapā (place for free distribution of water to thirsty travellers'), or 'tufts of hair should be kept on the head' (at caula according to the gotra ) are authoritative and establishes the conclusion that they are authoritative, since such smrti injunctions equally with Vedic ones are addressed to the same persons (viz. the followers of the Veda ) who have to act according to them. The idea is that those who perform the acts expressly enjoined by the Veda are also seen to perform the acts enjoined by such smrtis as that of Manu and therefore the principal reason why these smộtis are authoritative is the fact that those who know the Veda accept these smrtis as authorita tive and hold fast by them, as Medhātithi on Manu II. 6 says citing some verses from his own work called Smrtiviveka. 1614 Sabara endeavours to show that there are indications (linga) in the Vedic texts pointing to the existence of what is prescribed in the smrtis e.g. he cites the Vedic verse 'yam janah' as indicative

of astakās, Rg. X. 4. 1 of prapas, Rg. VI. 75. 17 of tufts of hair. The objection may be stated as follows The smrtis are composed by human authors (i. e. they are pauruşeya ) and so have no independent authority in matters of dharma, as a man may say what is either false or mistaken. If it be said that the smộtis really propound what is stated by the Veda, then they are practically superfluous and useless. and not being Veda they should be discarded (anapeksa ) To this the reply is that smộtis are generally authoritative, as they must be held to be based on Veda because they are composed by men (like Manu ) who were followers of the Veda, because what the smrtis lay down has been consistently followed from generation to generation by the sistas and because it is possible to regard the Veda as their source. To the question why the Vedic passages on which the smrti rules are postulated to have been based are not seen or found by us several answers were proposed by different writers. One view was that just as Vedic indications about locks of hair lead to the inference of śruti texts enjoining the keeping of tufts on the head, so the fact of the existence of such rules leads to the inference that śruti must have contained injunctions corres ponding to all smrti prescriptions. Kumārila raises objections to this view. Inference is based on perception (pratyakşa ) and invariable concomitance (vyāpti). There is no vyāpti between the smộtis and śruti texts that are never found pro nounced by any one, so no inference is possible and it would be like one blind man following another.1615 Manu must have composed his smộti on finding that ācāryas preceding him performed certain acts as based on Veda. These last must have believed that their predecessors also acted on the same belief, Hence there is what is called an 'andha-paramparā' on this hypothesis. And further this hypothesis of the inference of Sruti in all cases is opposed to perception, since as a matter of fact hundreds of Śruti passages are known that can be the basis of corresponding smrti texts. Another view is (and Kumārila holds that it is somewhat better than the preceding view ) that one should infer that the Vedic passages that were the basis of smptis are lost ( utsanna or pralīna). Some support is lent to this by such Vedic texts as ' anantā vai vedah' (Tai. Br. III 10.

11)and by Ap. Dh. S. I. 4. 12. 10. Even this view is not acceptable to the Tantravārtika and most of the Mīmāṁsakas. The objection against the 2nd view is raised as follows. Even Bauddhas and other heretical sects 1616 would advance the argument that their works also are based on śruti texts that are now lost, and any one may regard anything as authoritative by pretending that the basic vedic texts are lost. Further the Mimāṁsā view that the Veda is eternal ( nitya ) would be refuted if it were admitted that some portion of the Veda is lost. There is not much difference between the first view and the second view. Therefore Kumārila propounds the third view viz. that smộtis are to be inferred as based on Vedic texts that are already in existence 1617. If an objection is raised against this hypothesis that it must be explained why such Vedic texts ( the bases of smrtis ) are not seen or found, the Tantravārtika replies in a famous kārikā that as the Vedic šākhās (the several branches of the Veda) are scattered about (in various countries), as men (followers of the Veda) are negligent and unmindful (i.e. they do not visit all the countries and so are unable to have a complete knowledge of all Vedic texts ) and as several rules are declared in different contexts even when occurring in the same sākhā (and not at one place ) it is not always possible to point out the Vedic sources of smrti texts. If an objector were to ask : 'why were not the Vedic passages themselves (that are the sources of smrti rules ) embodied bodily into the smrtis,' Kumārila replies that this was not done from the fear of the loss of the correct arrangement of the Vedic texts as traditionally handed down. The Veda is principally concerned

with sacrifices, though now and then there are rules addressed to men for regulating conduct only. People would only study the Vedic sentences contained in the smộtis ( that are concerned principally with conduct) where they would be arranged in a different order according to subjects and there would thus be loss of the arrangement of the Veda as originally delivered. Visvarupa 1618 (on Yaj. I. 7) quotes the above verse of Kumarila and states that there are thousands of smrti rules that have their source in the Veda; he and Kumarila instance tha rules against talking with (or coming in contact with ) a woman in her monthly illness or the rule against assaulting a brāhmaṇa, or the rule about the sin of killing an ātreyi woman &c. Medhātithi on Manu II. 6 has an elaborate discussion on this very topic and quotes several verses from his own work called Smrtiviveka 1619. He does not approve of the first two views and follows Kumārila's view. Mimāmgā writers and commentators like Medhātithi say that Manu and other authors of smstis brought together for easy comprehension matters that are scattered about in the various Vedic texts, that are either not known to the students of the several sākhās or that cannot be brought together by men of ordinary or weak intellect, 16194 

The general proposition that sniștis are authoritative being established, a further question arises. What is to happen if a empti rule conflicts with the rule of the Veda? Jaimini deals

with this question in I. 3. 3-4, 1620 which form a topic that states an exception to the general rule contained in Jai. 1.3.1-2. Sabara gives three instances where there is apparently a conflict between the prescriptions of the śruti and those of smộtis. The Veda says, 'the priest should chant (the slotra) after touching the audumbari post', while smrti says 'the whole of the audum bart post should be covered with cloth'. The Veda says 'one to whom a gon has been born and whose hair is still dark (and has not turned grey ) should consecrate the Vedic fires', while smrti says 'a man should observe Vedic studenthood for 48 years' 1621 ; the Veda says 'when the Agnişoiniya rite is finished then one may eat (the food prepared) in the house of the sacrificer, while smṛti says 'the food of one who has undergone dikşā for a sacrifice may be eaten after he purchases the soma plant'. In these cases the proposition enunciated by Jaimini is that in case of conflict ( between an express sruti rule and a smrti rule) the smrti rule should be discarded, for when there is no conflict ( with an express sruti) inference may be made ( that a smrti rule is based upon some Vedic text).' The examples may be explained as follows: The 'audumbari' is a post of udumbara planted in the sudas in the performance of the Agnistoma ; the stotras (other than Bahispavamāna) are chanted near the audumbari post in the sadas. Vide H. of Dh. vol. II. p. 1155 for the fixing of the audumbara post in the sadas and p. 1185 for the chanting of stotras near the audumbari. If the whole of the post be covered with cloth, it would not be possible to touch the post, but only the cloth would be touched. So there is contra diction. If a man is to consecrate Vedic fires when he has a son and his hair is dark, he must be between about 20 and 40 (i. e. a young man), but if a man were to observe brahmacarya for

48 years, he would be about 52 to 56 years of age before he married ( as the upanayana of a brāhmaṇa was to be performed generally in the 8th year or from the 5th year onwards at the most). Only a married man could consecrate Vedic fires. But a man's hair when he is fiftytwo years of age or more can hardly be all dark. Therefore there is contradiction between the rule derived from the Veda and that derived from smrti. In the Jyotiptoma (which generally occupied five days), the dikşā (purification and initiation of the sacrificer) takes place on the first day in the afternoon (vide H. of Dh. vol. II. pp. 1134-1136 ). Soma is purchased on the 2nd day of the Jyoti stoma (ibid. 1140–4 ) and the animal is sacrificed for Agni and Soma on the 4th day (ibid. pp. 1158-59). According to śruti therefore the food prepared in the house of a diksita may be eaten only after the 4th day, while smrti says that it may be eaten after the purchase of soma on the 2nd day. In this way there is contradiction. Kumārila 1622 does not agree with Sabara as regards these examples in particular and as regards the general attitude towards smstis that are accepted by Vedic followers. He makes great efforts to explain how there is no real conflict in the cases cited by Sabara. As regards the cloth covering the audumbari he says that it may cover the bottom and the upper portion of the post and leave a space of two or three finger-breadths in the middle uncovered ( so that the audumbari post can be touched in that particular por tion), that (p. 188 ) there is a passage in the Sātyāyani

Brahmana which refers to the cloth covering the audumbari (and so there may at most be an option), that as regards the taking of food in the house of a dikşita after the purchase of soma there is a śruti passage in the Atharvavoda (pp. 181 and 189 ) similar to the smrti passage ( and thus there is no conflict between śruti and smrti, but between śruti and śruti, which would lead to an option) and further the smrti rule may apply in the case of a man in distress (ūpad dluermu), that smrti does not prescribe an absolute period of 48 years for the study of Veda, but Baud. Dh. S. itself allows several alternative or optional periods and so no question of conflict with śruti arises. Kumārila's own position is this: In the case of apparent conflicts between sruti and smộti, various methods of interpretation and reconciliation are possible. Each of the two may be given its proper scope as referring to different subject matters ( which is called vişayız-vyavasthā); it is also possible to hold that smrti is based on some sruti texts already existing but not found at the time of discussion, but which may ultimately be found, in which case there will be an option, though the latter is to be avoided as far as possible as it is liable to eight faults (vide Tantravārtika pp. 174-175 ); or the two may be reconciled even when referring to the same subject matter e. g. a man may have dark hair even when he is 52 or more and the smști may be taken as meant to refer to such a man, while the sruti states the general rule about the age when consecration of Vedic fires was to be made. Therefore Kumārila holds that all that is meant by Jaimnini and even by Sabara is that there is a great distinction between sruti and smrti in that the former is apauruşeya and an independent authority, while the latter has a human author (liable to err ), is either actually based on the Veda or is inferred to be so based, that the two therefore can never be said to be quite alike each other as regards their authoritativeness and that lastly smrti is not in itself to be regarded as unauthoritative 1623. Kumārila therefore suggests that the proper subject of discussion in Jai. I. 3. 3-4 is the works of Bauddhas, Sankhya, Yoga, Pañcarātra, Pāśupata and other heretical sects and the practices of mlecchas. These works contain some matters such as the emphasis on ahimsā, truthfulness, restraint of senses, charity and compassion, which are also emphasized in the Veda, but those works are not

Worlds of heretical sects 

835 

generally accepted by the followers of the Veda, are based on specious and false reasoning only (they are haitukas in the words of Manu), that they deny the authority of the Veda. Therefore Jaimini means that these works of heretic sects are not authoritative in matters of dharma as they are opposed to the Veda and should be discarded. For want of space it is not possible to set out in detail the interesting discussion in the Tantravārtika. The Jaiminiya-nyāya-mālāvistāra also gives another explanation of Jai. I. 3. 3. 

Sabara (on Jai. I. 3. 4) explains that the three smrti passages stated above are not authoritative since it is possible to point out how they originated in a visible worldly motive such as greed. When a visible motive can be pointed out for any smrti text, it is not proper to infer that it is based on the Veda and has an unseen spiritual motive. Sabara 1624 postulates the reasons in the way of a modern man finding fault with priests, Some priests covered the whole of the Auduinbari post with cloth, because they coveted the cloth as part of the fee; others who desired a free meal when hungry took food at the house of a dikşita even after he had purchased the Soma plant; certain others in order to conceal their absence of virility went in for Veda study for 48 years. The Tantravārtika tries to show that in all these cases there is really no visible motive such as covetousness ( pp. 188-189 ). 

Sabara gives an alternative explanation of this sutra (Jai. 1.3.4) and makes a separate topic (adhikarana) of it. The reasong 1625 for giving an alternative explanation of a sülra or adhikarana are two, viz. dissatisfaction with the explanation already given or the wide scope of the subject under discussion. In 1. 3.3 passages from smrtis were cited which were apparently in conflict with śruti. If they were really in conflict, that one reason alone is more than sufficient to render the smộtis invalid. Therefore to say further that those snirti passages originate in worldly motives like greed does not add any very substantial reason for the abandonment of smrtis as authoritative. There fore Sabara makes another adhikarapa of sutra 4 of Jai. 1. 3.

He cites gmpti passages which are not opposed to Veda at all and says that such passages have seen a worldly motive such as convetousness and it is not proper to suppose that they are based on Veda and are therefore authoritative, when a visible purpose or motive can be ascribed to them. The result of the explanations of I. 3. 3-4 given by Sabara would be that smrti rules that are opposed to śruti rules and smrti prescriptions that can be shown to have a clear worldly motive are not authoritative or absolutely binding, while the rest of smsti texts are authoritative. 1628 

Sabara cites on Jai. I. 3. 4 (when taken as a separate topic ) 16264 two examples; (1) the adhvaryu priest takes ( as his fee ) the cloth used in the Vaisarjana homa; (2) they perform the gift of the elephant ( i. a. the cloth covering) of the sacrificial post. Sabara says that these passages are not opposed to any śruti text but instead of inferring a Vedic text as their basis it is far better to hold that there is a manifest worldly motive for these rules ( viz. covetousness of the adhvaryu ) and so these smrti passages need not be looked upon as authorita tive. 1627 

This discussion raises an important doctrine which frequ ently figures in dharmaśāstra works. The doctrine is expressed

Rules having a visible purpose 

837 

in this form viz. when a visible motive or purpose is obvious in the case of a rule or prescription it is not proper to ascribe an unseen or spiritual purpose or reason for it. This doctrine is older than even Ap. Dh. S. I. 4. 12. 11 which says, 'where men act because they find pleasure in so doing, there śāstra has no scope'. Sabara also says, 1628 'those rules (in the smrti) that have a seen purpose derive their authority from that fact, while those that have no visible purpose may be inferred to be based upon the Voda (and derive their authority from that).' These words of Sabara are quoted by Kullūka on Manu III. 7 where Manu states that a girl should not be selected as a bride from a family that neglects the sanskāras, in which no male children are born, in which there is no Veda study, the members of which have on their bodies long and thick hair, that suffers from such diseases as piles, dyspepsia, epilepsy, black and white leprosy. Kullūka remarks that the works on medicine hold that such diseases are inherited and so if such a girl be married the progeny might suffer from those diseases, and thus this prohibition is based on a visible motive. From this a very important conclusion is drawn by dharmaśāstra writers viz. if one while performing a rite or when engaged in any matter acts contrary to a rule that has a seen purpose, the rite or matter does not become invalid or void, while where a rule is based on an unseen or spiritual purpose and it is infringed, the act itself becomes void or invalid.

On this the Mit. remarks that if a man marries a girl who is suffering from an incurable disease, the marriage is valid, only he does an act which runs counter to seen results (i, e. he may suffer the consequence that

his children may be diseased ), but if he goes through a oere mony of marriage with a girl who is a gapiņda or of the same gotra or prayara there is no valid marriage and the girl is not his legal wife. No clear visible purpose can be associated with the prohibition against marrying a sapiņda or sagotra girl; hence there must be a spiritual purpose in that prohibition and 80 if one infringes it the act itself (viz. marriage) becomes void, 1630 

The Tantravārtika of Kumārila has as usual a very long note on this discussion. He does not see eye to eye with Sabara. He says 1631 that the Mimāṁsā is concerned with the investiga tion of dharma, that śruti is the prime authority in matters of dharma, that Mimāṁsā has concern with smrtis only so far as their authoritativeness in matters of dharma goes, that just as agriculture and the like are not discussed in Mimāṁsā works because they have a purely secular purpose, •80 all acts that men do for a visible worldly purpose have no bearing on the investigation of dharma and that therefore the bhāsyakāra (Sabara ) was not quite right in saying that such practices as rising to receive an old man or a teacher have a visible purpose and are authoritative on that ground. He further remarks that visible and invisible or spiritual purposes are often inextricably mixed up. When the Veda prescribes 'he pounds the grains of paddy' or enjoins a sacrifice like the Kārlri for bringing down rain, there is a visible purpose therein (0.g. the rice grains have to be freed from husk before boiled rice for obla tions can be prepared ). So even when an act has a seen purpose it may still have Veda as the basis ; so also an act such as rising to show respect to a teacher may have a seen result ( such as the teacher being pleased teaches the pupils with enthusiasm ) as well as an unseen result (viz. completion of Veda study without obstacles ). Therefore he argues that all

Authority of smslis depends on purpose 

839 

smrtis 1632 are authoritative according to the purpose they serve, that whatever portion of the smrtis is concerned with dharma and mokşa ( final release from samsāra ) has its origin in the Veda and whatever is concerned with wealth and the satisfaction of desires (artha and kūna ) is based on worldly practices. In this way are to be explained the didactic portions of the Maha bhārata and the Purānas, the episodes in these being useful as urthavādus' (eulogies of what are prescribed as religious duties), the description of the several divisions of the earth being useful for indicating what countries are suitable for the per formance of dharma and the enjoyment of its rewards and being based partly on Veda and partly on direct experience. Similarly the auxiliary lores (angıs) of the Veda (such as phonetics, grammar, metrics &c.) are partly based on the Veda and partly on worldly experience. Mimāṁsa and Nyāya (logic) are necessary for the correct interpretation and understanding of the Veda ( as stated by Manu in XII. 105-106). He is even prepared to concede that systems 1633 like the Sāökhya ( which postulates a prime cause of the world called Pradhāna) or Vedānta ( which postulates Puruşa as the cause of the world ), the theory of atoms ( propounded by Kanāda ) serve the purpose of explaining the creation and dissolution of the world, lead one to understand how the performance of sacrifices gives rise to the subtle apūrva which leads on to heaven and also exemplify how human effort and fate have their own spheres of operation (i. e. without human effort the world is produced and in spite of human effort it may be dissolved ). Kumārila goes a step further and states that even the Buddhist philosophies of vijnāna ( cognitions being the only reality ), of the non-exis tence of the soul or of eternal flux arise from the arthavada

passages of the Upanişads and serve the purpose of inducing men to give up extreme attachment to sensual pleasures and therefore may be useful in their own way. He winds up by saying that in the case of all knowledge or works wherever the result (or reward) of the course laid down in them is to take place in the future and there is no possibility of experiencing its happening in the present such work may be deemed to be based on the Veda; but where, as in the science of medicine, the result can be seen taking place in other people, that know ledge is authoritative only because of the visible result. 

This discussion about smrtis based on the Veda or on perceptible purposes or motives is taken up in the digests on dharmaśāstra. For example, Aparārka 1634 (pp. 626-627 ) quotes long passages from the Bhavisyapurāņa dividing the contents of smộtis into five categories and exemplifying that division, viz. (1) those based on a visible purpose or motive, (2) those based on unseen or spiritual motives or purposes, (3) those based on both visible purposes and unseen or spiritual purposes, (4) those based on reasoning, (5) those that merely re-iterate what is already well-known or determined. All these except the first variety are based according to the Bhavisyapurana on the Veda. The examples of the five kinds given by the same Purāna are respectively as follows: (1) the smrti (viz. Arthaśāstra or Dandaniti) in which there is a discussion about six gupas (sandhi &c.), the four upāyas (sāma, dāna &c.), the various superintendents of state departments (adlıyakşa) and of kantakas; (2) the prescription that one should perform the sandhyū worship or that one should not partake of dog's flesh; (3) a brahmacūrin

Up. III. 5.1 (vyutthāyātha bhiksācaryam caranti) or Jābāla Up. 4. 

In I. 3. 5-7 Jaimini as interpreted by Sabara 1635 deals with the topic of the authoritativeness of certain usages laid down in the smộtis in relation to Vedic rites. Sabara states : šiştan say that religious rites should be performed after sipping water (i. e. after ācamana), one should wear the sacred thread in the upavita way in the worship of gods, one should do with the right hand all religious acts. The question is whether these aots should be done if not opposed to the sruti or should not be performed if opposed to what is taught in the Veda. The pūria pakşıı view is that these acts should not be done because they run counter to the sequence of the acts laid down in the Veda. For example, the Veda says, 'after getting ready a bundle (or handful ) of kusa grass called veda one should prepare the redi (altar)'. Here the preparation of the vedi is declared to follow immediately after the getting ready of a liandful of kušas. If after the handful is got ready a man has a sneeze he has accord ing to Manu V. 145 and Vas. III. 38 to sip water before going on with the preparation of the vedi. This would be against the sequence ( krama) of acts laid down in the Veda. Strangely enough Mr. K.L. Sarkar in T.L.L. (on Mimāmsā rules) translater the words 'vedam krtvā vedim karoti' as 'make the vedi and

then recite the vedas '(p. 241), thereby committing two mistakes He misunderstands the word 'veda' which in this passage only means a 'liandful of kuśas' and inverts the sequence of the acts denoted by the gerundial termination 'tvā'. On account of these two mistakes the discussion on pp. 240-242 is mislead ing and obscure. If a man were to do the things required in a vedic rite with both hands, he would be able to do them quickly. The smrti rule that every religious act should be done with the right hand alone interferes with the quick performance of religious acts. The established conclusion is that these religi ous acts (such as acaniana ) are performed by the sistas, are prompted by no visible motive ( such as covetousness ) and are therefore to be looked upon as authoritative, being not opposed to sruti. Kumārila does not like this way of explaining the gūtras, since the instances given by Sabara really do not deserve to be put forth as even prima facie opposed to Sruti. The Tantra vārtika (p. 201) sets out sruti pagaages wherein the wearing of the sacred thread in the upavita forin2636 (Tai. S. II. 5. 11. 1 and Tai. Ār. II. 1), acamana (Tai. Ā.. II. 11 ), are enjoined. Therefore it explains the sūtras in a different way. It splits up Jai. I. 3.5-7 into two adhikaraņas. The first two constitute one topic. The pūrvapakşa 1637 is : those precepts of Buddha and other founders of sects, such as the construction of monasteries and parks, the insistence on desirelessness, the practice of meditation, ahiṁsā, truthfulness, restraint of senses, charity and kindness, are such that they are also laid down by the Veda, are not opposed to the ideas of sistas or do not run counter to nor rouge those who know the Veda to anger and therefore they must be held to be authoritative. This is denied by saying that the Bauddha doctrines even on the abovesaid matters are not to

be accepted as authoritative since only a limited 1638 number ( 14 or 18 ) of vidyās (the four vedas, the upavedas, the angas of the voda, the 18 smstis, purānas, Dandaniti) have been accepted by the vedic śistas as authoritative on matters of dharma and the works of the Bauddhas and Jainas are not included therein. Just as milk though originally pure becomes useless and unreliable when put into a bag of dog-skin, so the doctrines of Bauddhas such as ahimsā, though based on truth, are useless and are not authoritative in themselves for the followers of the Veda. 

The Tantravārtika holds that Jai. I. 3.7 is an adhikarana by itself and is concerned with the authoritativeness of sadācāra (the customs and usages of śistas ). Its position is that those usages are authoritative that are not opposed to express Vedic texts, that are practised by Vedic sistas under the belief that they are riglit conduct (dharına ) and for which no visible motive ( such as pleasure or the satisfaction of desires or the acquisition of wealth ) can be predicated. Sistas are those who perform the religious acts expressly enjoined by the Veda. They are not so called because they practise what is said to be sadācāra ; otherwise there will be an argument in a circle (in the form 'sadācāra means what is practised by śiştas and sistas are those who practise sadācāra'). The practices traditionally handed down from generation to generation which are observed by sistas ( as stated above ) with the idea that they constitute a part of dharma must be regarded as dharma and as leading to heaven. 1639 Practices do not become authoritative by the mere fact that no such motive or purpose can be postulated for them, but they become so only when they are observed by śiştas as

part of dharma. The Tantravārtika (p. 205 ) gives certain illustrations of such practices viz gifts, japa, mātryajña (offerings to the mother Goddesses ), the festival of Indra's banner, fairs held at temples, fasts by maidens on the 4th day of a month, gifts of lamps on the first day of Kārtika, the Apring 1640 festival on the first day of the dark half of Phālguna &c. The Tantravārtika is careful to point out that many activities such as agriculture, menial service or trade that are the means of securing wealth and pleasures and that give rise to several fixed and varying acts and also such actions as eating sumptuous food, drinking, sleeping on soft beds, possessing a charming house and garden, engaging in painting, singing and dancing, enjoying the fragrance of sandalwood and flowers, all of which are common to inlecchas and Aryas, are not deemed by any one to be part of dharma and that it does not follow that, because a few actions (of sigtas) are accepted as dharma, all their actions are to be looked upon as dharma.1641 In ordinary life certain practices only are deemed to be siştācāra, while there are certain other acts that are common to all human beings (including śiştas ), but are not so regarded. Certain practices such as worship of gods and honouring brāhmaṇas are Been to be common among all people and yet do constitute dharma, because that is deemed to be so by the sistas. Those practices alone are dharma that are observed by sistas only as obligatory on thein and not other practices that are common to all beings. The Trantravārtika then refers to the Dharma

Ancient transgressions of dharma 

845 

sūtra 1642 of Gaut. ( 1.3 ) and Ap. Dh. S. (II. 6. 13.7-8) which say that ancient (or great) men in several instances were guilty of transgressions of dharma and of committing desperate acts, that on account of their spiritual merit they did not incur sin but if a man of later days were to follow them in the same acts he would sink into hell. It then gives twelve instances of lapses from good conduct (attributed even to avuārs ) that were trang grossions and either explains them away or says that they were due to wrath, hatred or other passions, were not intended by the authors ( of those acts ) themselves to be dharma and are not to be looked upon as ģiştācāra by modern men. The instances are: (1) Prajāpati who is said to have approached Uşas, his daughter (Sat. Br. I. 7. 4. 1 or Ait. Br. 13. 9); (2) Indra, who is described as the paramour of Ahalyā ( in the Subrahmanya litany ); (3) Nahuşa, who occupied the position of Indra, made approaches to Saci, the wife of Indra (Udyoga, chap. 13 ff) and was transformed into an jagura (Boa Constrictor);(4) Vasiştha, who when his 100 sons were devoured by a demon, was so struck with grief that he threw himself bound into the Vipāśā river(Nirukta IX.26, Adiparva chap. 177.1-6=cr. ed. 167. 1-6, Vanaparva 130. 8-9, Anušāsana 3. 12-13); (5) Purüravas who thought of dying by hanging or by being devoured by wolves (Rg. X. 95. 14, Sat. Br. XI. 5. 1-8) when separated from Urvasi; (6) Viśvāmitra, who officiated as priest at the sacrifice of Trisanku that had become a cāndala through a curse ( Adiparva 71. 31-33);(7) Yudhisthira who took Draupadi as wife although she had been won by his younger brother Arjuna by his skill in archery and who prevaricated in order to bring about the death of his brāhmaṇa teacher Drona (Dronaparva 190. 55); (8) Kropa Dvaipāyana. (Vyāsa), wbo thought himself a perpetual student, procreated by niyoga at the request of his mother Satyavati two sons on the widows of his brother Vicitravīrya; (9) Bhişma who lived on without be longing to any ( of the four ) aśramas and who is said to have performed several Aśramedhas though he had no wife; (10)

Rāma who performed Asyamedha accompanied by a golden image of Sitā ; (11) Dhṛtarāstra, though blind, performed sacri fices; (12) Vāsudeva and Arjuna are described as being drunk and as having married Rukmini and Subhadrā respectively who were their maternal uncle's daughters (such marriages being forbidden). Kumārila, like a modern comparative mythologist, explains (Tantravārtika p. 208 ) that Prajapati means 'the Sun' who approaches (i. e. rises after ) the Dawn. This explanation is as old as the Ait. Br. 13. 9 where it is said that there are two views viz. it is either Heaven' or 'Uşas' that is meant by the word 'daughter. Similarly Indra and Ahalyā respectively mean the Sun and the Night and jāra means literally one who makes to disappear or wither away' (and not paramour) in that passage. Vide H. of Dh. vol. II. p. 1145 note 2550 for the epi thet. Ahalyāyai jāra' in the Veda and quotation from Tantra vārtika. The story of Ahalya and Indra varies in its details in the epics. Vide Rāmāyana I. 48, Udyoga 12. 6. These two are instances of transgression of dharma (dharma-vyatikrama) and the next case of Vasiştha is an example of sāhasa (through sorrow ). Kumārila says that Viśvāmitra was prompted by his hatred of Vasistha and his pride, that the sin accruing from his act would be neutralized by his great austerities. So his actions cannot serve as a model for imitation by others. Vyāsa, who was a son of Satyavati from Parāśara when she was a maiden, had Vicitravirya as (his uterine ) brother after Satya vati married Santanu. In the case of a brahmacārin, sexual intercourse is most reprehensible ( vide H. of Dh, vol. II. p. 374) But Vyāsa agreed to niyoga because of his regard for his mothe as allowed by Gaut. 18. 4-5. Kumārila adds that Vyāsa could do so on account of his great past and future austerities, that another person with similar qualifications may do so even in spite of all prohibitions, since the Mahābhārata ( Aśramavāsika 30. 24) says 'sarvam balavatāṁ pathyam' (to the strong every thing is wholesome or allowable). He gives an apt illustration. An elephant can devour branches of trees without harm, but others doing so would meet death. Dakşa V.10 prescribes 'anāśra. ml na tiştheta kşanamekamapi dvijaḥ' (a twice-born person should not stay even for a moment unattached to some āśrama), Bhisma remained unmarried out of filial devotion to his father and Rāma could not think of another wife as he was so much attached to Sitā. Kumārila boldly asserts that Bhisma hada wife only for the purpose of the sacrifices he performed (though this is mentioned in no Itibāsa or Purāņa ) and relies upon the 

ILI )

mode of proof called arthāpotti for this 1643. His words are given below. This and some other explanations offered by Kumārila shed a very interesting light on the theological apologetics of Mimāmsakas. Vide H. of Dh. vol. II. pp. 558 and 684 for Rāma and the golden image of Sitā. As to Yudhisthira's bringing about the death of his brābmana teacher the explanation is that the former performed Aśvamedha after the end of the war by way of prayascitta ( vide H. of Dh. vol. II. p. 147 11. 333 and pp. 1236-37 notes 2674-75 for Aśvamedha as the re mover of all sins). As to Draupadi being the wife of five brothers Kumārila quotes Adiparva 198. 14 ( =cr. ed. 190. 14) and offers several explana tions (p. 209 ), the most astounding being that there were five wives of the five brothers who were so similar that they were all referred to as one. As the Nyāyasudhā (p. 194 ) remarks, these various explanations were offered to show off great re sourcefulness of interpretation (paribāra-vaibhayārtham), the proper one being that the practice of the Pandavas was an evil one and was not to be imitated. A blind man could not perform sacrifices and was excluded from inheritance. Vide H. of Dh. vol. II. p. 157 n. 369 and vol. III. p. 609 n. 1154. But Kumārila says that as Dhstarāstra was blessed with sight for a while and saw his deceased sons through the miraculous power of Vyāsa ( Aśramavāsiparva chap. 32-37 ) he might have been endowed with sight at the time of the sacrifices or what is meant is that he made gifts which are spoken of as sacrifices. As regards Subhadrā, Kumārila asserts that in spite of the fact that Subhadra was said in the Adiparva ( 219,18 = cr. ed. 211. 18 ) to have been the daughter of, Vasudeva and sister of Krsna, she was really the daughter of Krspa's step-mother's sister or the daughter's daughter of the sister of his step-mother's father (a female cousin being often called a sister among the Lātas ). Vide H. of Dh. vol. II. pp. 459-460 and notes to my edition of the text of V. Mayūkba ( pp. 200-202 ). Krsna's marriage with Rukmini is to be similarly explaind. It is somewhat surpris

ing that Khapdadeva states that it is nowhere found that Subhadrā was the daughter of Vasudeva. Probably he had a corrupt reading of the Mahabharata passage before him. As to the charge of drinking spirituous liquor (ubhau madhvāsa vakşibau in Udyogaparva 59. 5) against both Vāsudeva and Arjuna, they were both ksatriyas and only brāhmaṇas were prohibited from drinking any kind of intoxicating drink (Gaut. II. 25), while to kşatriyas and vaiśyas two kinds of wine called madhu ( liquor from honey or madhuka flowers) and sidhu (rum ) were allowed and only paişti ( spirituous liquor distilled from flour) was forbidden (by Gaut. II, 25, Manu XI. 93-94). 

Kumārila offers some other explanations of Jai.1644 I. 3. 5-7 which need not be set out here. 

Kumārila mentions certain practices of his times and concludes that they are to be condemned and not to be followed or regarded as authoritative. He says: 1645 even in these days brahmana women of Ahicchatra and Mathurā drink wine ; northerners ( northern brāhmaņas ) engage in such transactions as the gift and sale of horses and mules that have a mano, asses,

camels and animals with two rows of teeth and eat from the same plate with their wives, children and friends; brāhmaṇas of the south enter into matrimony with the naternal uncle's daughter and take their meals while seated on a couch (of wicker work); both ( brāhmaṇas of the north and south ) tako cooked food ( kept in pots ) that remains after their friends or relatives have partaken of it or that has been touched by them. ( at the time of eating); they chew betelnut leaves that have been touched by persons of all varņas, do not perform sipping of water (ācamana ) at the end of the chewing of betelnut, wear clothes washed by washermen and brought on the back of asses; they do not avoid contact even with persons guilty of grave sins (except of brāhmaṇa murder). There are everywhere an infinite number of very obvious transgressions of the subtle dictates of dharma laid down for each man, caste or family, that (transgressions ) are contrary to śruti, smrti and each other and that have a visible purpose behind them. It is not possible to regard such practices as authoritative.' Similarly Varadarāja, (1600-1660 A. D.) a pupil of Bhattoji Diksita, in his work styled the Gīrvānapadamañjari in a dialogue between a Kānyakubja brāhmaṇa and a sannyāsin hailing from Vijayanagara makes the brāhmaṇa host say that each country has certain practices which are durācāras such as marrying a maternal uncle's daughter in the south, marriage of girls among southerners even before they are four years old, sitting down to a meal without bathing in Karnātaka, in Mahārāstra the marriage of a younger brother before an elder one, in the hilly country the practice of niyoga (vide Mr. P. K. Gode's interesting paper in 'Bharatiya-vidya' vol. VI pp. 27-30). 

According to Sabara, Jaimini in I. 3. 8-9 deals with certain words like yava, varāha and vetasa, that have different signi ficances among Aryas and Mlecchas ( and therefore these sūtras constitute what is called yavavarāhādhikarana). But Kumārila does not like this view of Sabara and proposes another topic for these two sutras, viz. the relative strength of smrti and sadācāra where they are in conflict. Here there are three 1646 possible

views, viz. that both are equally strong and so there is an option in case of conflict, that ācāra is stronger, that smrti is the stronger of the two. The prima facie view is that both are equally strong, since smrti and sadācāra are both inferred to be based upon Veda. Kumārila's own final conclusion is that smrti is of greater force than ācāra, that is, where they come in direct conflict smộti sliould prevail. His position is that, though both smrti and acāra are to be deemed to be based on Veda, there is a difference between the two. People have full faith in such smrtis as that of Manu and Manu and others are believed to have been inspired sages and are the propounders of the rules of dharma scattered about in various Vedic sākhās, while the same cannot be said about modern men and their practicos cannot claim or possess the same weight and allegiance that the practices laid down by Manu and other sages can From the practice of sistas one may infer a smrti as the root thereof and then further one may infer a śruti as the root of the smrti. Therefore acāra is removed by two stages from the Veda, while smrti is removed only by one stage from the Veda. Hence Kumārila says that in case of conflict smrti should prevail over &cāra. The practices that are discussed here ( acc. to Kumārila, Parthasarathi and others ) are such as the marriage with a maternal uncle's daughter or with a paternal aunt's daughter and the like that are in vogue among certain people and that are yet opposed to emstis (such as Manu XI, 171-72 ) and for which a visible motive can easily be found (kāmādihetvuntarań spasta meva drtyate, as the Sāstradipikā says) 

Kumārila gives another (and so a third ) explanation of Jai. I. 3, 8-9 1647 which need not detain us here.

Holākādhikarana 

851 

Jai. I. 3. 15-23 constitute what is called Holākadhikarana, or Samānyaśrutikalpanādhikarana. The first two and the last two gūtras are the most important. Certain practices 1648 like the Holaka (spring) festival are observed by the easterners, certain others like Åbninaibuka (worship of growing Karanja or Arka or other trees as handed down in one's family ) by the southerners, and the Udvrsabhayajña (honouring oxen on the Full Moon of Jyestha and making them run a race) by the nor therners. The question is: whether, in making an inference about these practices being based on Veda, one was to suppose that the inferred Vedic text also should be restricted to the easter ners and the like 1649. The pūrvapakşa view is that the śruti to be inferred as the basis of the respective practices must be deemed to be restricted to certain persons only (such as the easterners i. e. pracyas &c.). The established conclusion is that

such practices must be deemed to be meant for all, since the general rule about vedic injunctions is that they are applicable to all. The performer specially meant by each Vedic injunction is known in either of three ways, 1650 viz. by capability, by non prohibition and by the employment of a special epithet or attribute. When it is said 'svargakāmo yajeta' then only the three twice-born classes are meant, for, they alone are capable of tending the sacred fires and of possessing Vedic learning and a śūdra is not a fit person to whom that injunction can apply. Those who are guilty of grave sins (patita) and the impotent are prohibited from performing Vedic rites. When the Veda says ' rājā rājusūyena yajeta' there is a special attribute of the performer ( viz. being a ksatriya ) prescribed by the śruti and so no one else can perform Rājasūya. When none of these three exists a Vedic vidhi is in general meant for all (sarvadharma). The practices of Holākā, Vrşabhayajña and the like should not be held to be restricted to certain countries or people only, but should be inferred to be applicable to all. When a man leaves the east and goes to the south, he may still perform the Holākā festival; while a man from the eastern country itself may not perform it at all. Further the words 'southern, eastern and northern' are relative. A country that is called southern may be to the north of another. Therefore Holākā and other practices are not invariably concomitant with particular countries or peoples. Nor can it be said that those practices require those particular countries for their performance in the way in which Sruti expressly requires the Vaišvadeva rito ( one of the four cāturmāsyas ) to be performed on a spot that slopes towards the east. The Tantravārtika 1651 points out that persons receive appellations from names of countries on various grounds as being born in a country or as residing therein or as coming from that country or as going to that country. Medhatithi ,on Manu VIII. 46 says the same.

Authorituliveness of GȚhya and Dharma sutras 

853 

The Tantravārtika explains that the first two gūtras are meant to refer to another question also, viz. whether the rules of the grhyasutras 1652 and of such dharmasutra works as the sātra of Gautama are authoritative only as to certain groups or are meant to be authoritative for all. He begins by saying that the Puranas, the Manusmrti and Itihāsa ( i. e. the Mahabharata) are equally authoritative for all people and then points out that the Gobhila-gļhya and Gautama-dharmasutra are traditionally accepted by the students of the Sāmaveda, that the dharmasutra of Vasistha is accepted by the students of the Rgveda, the sūtra of Sankha-Likhita by the followers of the white Yajurveda and the sütras of Apastamba and Baudhāyana by the followers of the Taittirfya Sakhā. The Šāstradipikā explains that an author who was a student of the Samaveda taught his own work to his pupils who also learned the Sāmaveda under him, that these pupils in their turn taught that work to others and in that way there arose a tradition among the students of the Sāmaveda to study the sūtra of Gautama. Therefore, to say even as to gļhyā works that they are restricted to particular groups of persons is not correct. Similarly in the case of practices there is no epithet or attribute that is common to all those who practise them or which distinguishes those who do not observe them from those that observe them and therefore it is not possible to restrict such practices as Holākā to particular countries or groups of people. 

The requisites of valid customs ag laid down by the emi. nent writers of the Purva-mimamsa school may now be suin marised. Such customs must be ancient, must not be opposed to the express texts of the Veda or of sinsti, must be such as to be regarded as obligatory by the sistas and must be observed

by them with the consciousness that they are so, they must not have a seen or visible purpose, and they must not be im moral 1653. It has to be remembered that the pūrvamimāmsā writers did not lay down anything about the binding character of usages that were peculiarly secular but restricted their remarks to customs and usages that had more or less an unseen or spiritual purpose. Khandadeva emphasizes this by stating *only those customs can be deemed to be based on the Veda that are not opposed to the Veda and smộtis and that are obser ved by respectable people under the belief that thereby they are carrying what dharma dictates '1653. Medhātithi on Manu 1655 II. 18 makes this position quite clear after quoting a verse of Kumārila'a smộti that is opposed to the Veda or is self-contra dictory, or has a visible secular purpose or expressly states a motive (for observing its precepts) cannot be deemed to be based on the Veda'. The Mimāmsā-kaustubha (p. 51 on Jai. I. 3.7) quotes a verse to the effects that only those whose ancestors also observed certain usages handed down from gene ration to generation would not incur blame by observing them (if they are opposed to śruti or smrti), but not others ( who

CHAPTER XXXIII 

CUSTOMS AND DHARMASASTRA WORKS 

It is now necessary to see how Dharmaśāstra works have dealt with the authority and binding force of customs and usages. Sadācāra is defined by Harita as follows 1657:- the word 'sat' means 'good' and the good are those who are free from (inoral) taint; the practices of such people are called sadācāra. Vide Manu II. 18, which also defines sadācāra. Even the most ancient sūtras testify to the fact that numerous customs and usages had arisen in different countries and vil lages. The Aśv. gr. (1. 7.1-2) says, 1658 various indeed are the observances of ( different ) countries and villages; one should follow those in marriages; what, however, is common (to all or most ) shall be declared by us'. The Ap. gr. (II. 15) declares, * people should understand from women what procedure is to be observed (according to custom)' and the Ap. Dh. S. provides (1. 7. 20. 8 = II. 11. 29. 14 ) that one 1659 should regulate one's course of action ( in difficult or doubtful matters ) according to the conduct which is unanimously approved of in all countries by the Āryas (men of the three higher castes ), who have been properly disciplined, who are aged, who have restrained their senses and who are neither covetous nor hypocritical and con cludes with the aphorism (II. 11. 29. 15 ) 'some teachers hold that the rest of the dharmas (not set out in this work ) may be understood from women and from men of all castes'. Baud. Dh. S. 1660 (1. 5. 13) states (on the subject of śrāddha) 'the us. ages of people should be followed as to other rites to be per formed'. Several gļhyasūtras (like Pāraskara II. 17, Mānava

gr. I. 4.6) refer to the practices of people that should be followed in such matters as commencing agricultural operations, holi days &c. It is needless to set out these in detail here. Manu1661 IV, 178 pronounces the general prescription for all men, 'one should walk in the path of good men which their fathers and grandfathers trod; by so doing one will come to no harm'. For ordinary men this procedure is easy to understand and to follow. This dictum sets a premium on the attitude of no change in any matter for fear that change may lead to some unexpected harm and has been throughout the ages up to the present the inotto of most people in India. As ācara or sadācāra is tangible and requires no effort to decide between conflicting views, we find eulogies of it in the earliest smrtis and purāņas. Vide Manu IV. 155-158, Vas. VI. 6-8 (the first and last of which are the same as Manu IV. 157-158), Anušāsanaparva 104. 6-9, Vignu Dh. S. 71. 90-92 ( which are almost the same as Manu IV. 155, 156, 158), Mārkaņdeya chap. 34, Brahmapurāņa 121. 6-9, Vişnu purāna III. chapters 11-12, Kurniapurāna (uttarardha, chap.15). 

The general rule about the binding character of customs is set out as follows. Gaut. (XI. 20) obseryes, 1662 the dharmas (customs) of countries, castes and families, which are not upposed to the Vedic scriptures, are authoritative and binding'. Gaut, provides in the next two sūtras that cultivators, traders, herdsmen, money-lenders and artisans can lay down conven tions or usages that would be binding on the respective classes, that when a dispute arises as to these usages the king should learn affairs from those who wield authority over those clagses and decide the dispute accordingly. Vas. I. 17 states, 'Manu has declared that the (peculiar) customs of countries, castes and families may be followed in the absence of rules propounded by the Veda', and in XIX. 7 prescribes that the king should

enforce these among the four varnas. Ap. Dh. S. II. 6. 15.1 appears to lay down that the customs of countries and families (if not opposed to Veda) are authoritative and are to be follow ed in the respective countries or families. But this view seems to be unacceptable to Baudh, Dh. S. (I. 1. 19-26) which says, 1663 thero is difference of opinion regarding five (practices) in the South as well as in the North. We shall explain those peculiar to the south. They are: to eat in the company of ( in the same plate with ) one whose upanayana is not performed, to eat in the company of one's wife, to partake of stale food, to marry the daughter of a maternal uncle or of a paternal aunt. Now ( the customs peculiar) to the north are: to sell wool, to drink rum, to deal in the sale of animals with an upper and a lower row of teeth, to follow the profession of arms and to travel by sea. He who follows (these practices) in any other country than where they are generally in vogue commits sin, For, in respect of these customs the authoritativeness must be restricted to the respective countries. Gautama declares that this is false. And one should not approve of (accept) either ( of the two sets of practices), because they are opposed to the tradition of siştas (or opposed to the emptis and the views of śiştas)'. The Tantravārtika 1664 (p. 211) mentions the argument of some con cerning these passages of Ap. and Baud, viz. that Apastamba's very general statement that practices of countries and families are authoritative in the respective countries cannot be accepted

as valid, as it is opposed to the views of Gaut. (XI. 20 ), as Baud. expressly states that certain practice, though prevalent in certain localities cannot be accepted as valid and binding even in those localities because they are opposed to the express words of such authoritative and highly yenerated smrtis (as those of Manu). Manu in several places provides for the enfor ceability of customs and usages. In Manu VII. 203 it is said, *the conqueror should hold as authoritative and binding the lawful customs of the conquered country, just as they are stated to be' and in Manu VIII. 41 and 461665 it is provided, 'A king who knows dharma ( sacred law) should carefully inquire into 

· the customs of castes, of countries, of guilds and of families 

and settle (or enforce) the customs peculiar to each. Whatever may have been practised by the good and by twice-born men 

devoted to dharma, that shall be established (by the king) as the law, provided it be not opposed to the ( customs of ) coun tries, families and castes'. Medhatithi adds that the king has to see wliether the customs of countries, families, castes and guilds are directly in conflict with the Veda or are harmful to others or utterly immoral (such as marrying one's mother) and only those that are found not to be 80 are to be enforced by the king and he 1666 adds on Manu II. 6 that the practices of sistas (persons who are well conducted, free from greed and learned in the Veda ) on matters on which the Veda and smrti are silent and which they observe with the consciousness that they (prac tices) are right (dharma) should be deemed to be based on Veda. He offers certain illustrations of such practices and also

It should be noted that in other works also the Pārasikas were credited with the highly immoral practice of marrying one's own mother.

relies 1667 upon the words of the Mahabharata (Vanaparva 313. 117), 'what is true dharma is concealed as in a dark cave; the (only) path is to follow great men'. In I. 118 Mann declares that the ancient (or long enduring ) laws (or customs) of countries, castes, families and the rules among heretics and companies (of traders and the like) have been dealt with by him in the gāstra ( Institutes ). Yāj, I. 343 provides that when a conqueror reduces a country to subjection he should preserve intact whatever customs, laws and judicial procedure, and family usages are handed down from generation to generation therein ( provided they are not opposed to sõstras and, as the Mit. says, he should not cause confusion by imposing the us ages of his own country on the conquered country). Yāj. II. 192 (like Manu and Gaut.) provides that the varying usages and conventions of śreņis (guilds of artisans), naigamas (traders), heretics and associations (of soldiers and the like) should be respected by the king in the same way as he honours the usages of learned brāhmaṇas. About the latter Yāj. II. 186 says that the king should sedulously enforce the conventions of learned brāhmaṇas which are not opposed to the dictates of the Veda and smrti (such as about pastures, water-courses and wells and the preservation of temples) and he should also enforce his edicts that are not opposed to Veda and smrti (such as making pro vision for travellers and prohibiting the sale of horses to an enemy &c.). Kautilya prescribes 1668 that the king should follow as regards inheritance and partition the customs that are in vogue in a country, a caste, a sangha (company or guild) or a village. Devala 1669 and Bphatparāśara (X. p. 281) have a verse very similar to Yāj. I. 343. The Mahābhārata remarks that there is no custom or practico that can be said to be beneficial

to all alike 1670, ' From this it follows that variations in prac tices were to be tolerated by the king. Bphaspati 1671 advises the king to keep intact the customs of countries, castes and fāmilies that have been long in vogue in them and states that otherwige the subjects become irritated and disaffected and there is logs of wealth and army. He gives certain striking illus trations of peculiar practices: 'members of the twice-born classes in the southern countries take in marriage their mater nal uncle's daughter; in the middle country (the country between the Himalaya and the Vindhya lying to the west of Prayāga and to the east of Vinaśana where the Sarasvati dis appears, as said by Manu II. 21 ) artisans and menial workers eat the flesh of a cow; in the eastern countries people (all in cluding brāhmaṇas ) eat fish and women are given to adultery; in the north women drink liquor and contact with then even in their monthly illness is allowed; the people of the Khasa country take as wives the widows of their own brothers; these several people are not liable to undergo punishment or penance because of their doing these things in the respective countries'. Medie val writers differed about the meaning of the last half verse. The Madanaratna said (acc. to V. P. p. 22) that there is neither punishment nor prāyaścitta when the above practices which are opposed to smrti texts are indulged in by the inhabitants of the countries specified, while the V, P. P. 22 holds that there is only absence of punishment at the king's hands for these people in those countries, but they are still liable to undergo prāyaścitta and that if these practices are followed in other countries both punishment and prayascitta have to be undergone.

History of Dharmatastra 

I Vol. 

Kat. 1672 defines what is meant by the customs of countries and families and states how and when they are to be enforced: 

That is said to be the custom of a country, which is in vogue in a country, is of long standing and is not opposed to the Veda and Smrti. That is called family custom which has come down hereditarily in a family as right conduct ( dharma) to be observed (by members of that family ); the king should pro serve it as it is. In disputes between the residents of the same country or capital, hamlet of cowherds, town or village the decision should be based on their own conventional usages, but in disputes between inhabitants of these and others the decision must be in accordance with the sacred texts. Therefore the king should decide the causes of people according to the rules of śāstra: but in the absence of texts he should carry out ( the administration of justice ) according to the usage of the coun try. Whatever conventions are settled in accordance with the consent of the people of a ) country should always be preserved in writing sealed with the royal seal. Such conventions should be sedulously upheld as if they were the dictates of sāstra and the king should decide ( disputes ) after carefully consider ing them.' Here Kāt. is principally concerned with the decision of legal disputes on the basis of the customs of countries and fainilies, but his rules also have a general application. He also states that in the case of the conflict of laws by which the parties are governed śāstra prevails. Pita maba 1673 has a similar verse about the usages of towns, villages and guilds and mentions that Bộ. hold the same view. Manu also (VII. 3 ) requires the king to decide the disputes of people according to principles drawn from local customs ( detadrsta hetu ) and from the Institutes of law ( śāstradışta). Medhātithi (on Manu VIII. 3 ) gives some interesting illustrations of local customs; viz. in certain southern localities a sonless widow

occupies a square low table in the hall of justice, when she is struck with dice by the judicial officers and then she gets her husband's property (this is a reminiscence of Nirukta III. 5 explaining Rg. I. 25. 7), in the north there is a custom that when certain persons come on behalf of a bridegroom seeking for a virgin in marriage and they are fed at the house of the girl's father then it is implied that there is a promise to give that girl in marriage to that particular bridegroom. These two customs are not opposed to any sruti or smrti (and even the V. P. p. 10 refers to the second as prevalent in the north and Madhyadesa ). But Medhātithi mentiong other local usages that are opposed to smộti e. g. grain is lent in spring and in the autumnn of tho same year double of it is taken. This is opposed to the rules of smrti laying down rates of interest. 

Very difficult questions arise in regard to the relative force of sruti, smộti and sadācāra and numerous rules have been laid down in cases of apparent and real conflicts among them. As Manu II. 6, Vas. 1. 4-5 and Yāj. I. n mention the sources of dharına to be sruti, smrti and sadācara in that order, the Mitāk sarā remarks 1674 that ' in case of conflict, each preceding one of those three has more force (or binding character ) than each succeeding one.' Sruti or Veda is recognised by all smrti writers as the highest or supreme authority for those who desire to know what dharma 1675 is (vide Manu II. 13 and Yāj. I. 40). If two vedic texts of equal authority are in conflict, then Gaut 1676 1. 5, Manu II. 14 and Jābāli declare that there is an option. For example, there are two Vedic texts 'he takes the sodasin cup in the Atirātra sacrifice' and 'be does not take the sodasin cup in the Atirātra'. In this case there is an option. Similarly Vedic texts say that the daily Vedic agnihotra may be performed after sunrise, or before sunrise or when neither the sun nor stars are visible. Therefore there is an option, viz. the daily agni hotra offering may be made at any one of the three times speci fied (Manu II. 15). But a vedic text which is in apparent con flict with another is not always of equal force with that other. In such a case there is no option, and various rules are laid

down in the Pārvamināmsā some important ones among which will be discussed at length in the section on Pürvamsmāmsā. Such texts may be explained by holding that one lays down a general rule (sāmānya), while the other lays down a special rule ( višeşa ) or an exception, or that one is a vidhi and the other merely an arthavāda or that the two texts have different scopes or refer to different ages &c. All these rules about the interpretation of Vedic texts have been held to apply to smrti passages. For example, Manu VIII. 381 is a general rule abso lutely prohibiting the killing of a brābmana. While Manu VIII. 350 allowing the killing of a brāhmaṇa in self-defence is a special rule or may be regarded as a mere artha vāda ( viz. even a guru who is really not to be killed on any account may be killed when he is an atatāyin, what of others, as the Mit, on Yāj. II. 21 explains). Similarly Manu VIII. 351 saying that there is no fault (i.e. no sin, no punishment and no prayaścitta) in playing an ātatayin has restricted scope as applying only to an atatāyin who is not a brahmaņa. A few more examples will be given immediately. below. 

In cases of conflict between śrutiand smrti, the rules laid down by the Pūrvamimāmsā have already been explained (pp. 839-34). Jaimini VI. 1. 13-14 and Sabara furnish an example. If, relying on Manu VIII. 416, the pūrvapakşa were to argue that women own no wealth and so should not engage in a vodic sacrifice then as that smrti so interpreted is opposed to the Veda it may be discarded by women 1677, Smộtis also lay down certain gene rul rules on that point. Laugākşi 1678 and Jābāla lay down that in case of contradiction between śruti and smrti, the former has greater force and that if there is no contradiction then what is laid down in the smrti should be observed as if it were laid down by the Veda. The Mit, on Yaj. III. 46 admits that a proposit ion of the Veda cannot be set aside (lūdhita ) by even a special proposition in a smrti text. But in spite of the general proposi. tion commentators like Vibyarūpa, Medhātithi and Vijñānesvara

had to admit that what was laid down by śruti texts was set aside or contradicted or abandoned by smrti texts or by popular sentiment. After the Udayaniya (concluding işti) in the Agni. stoma sacrifice was finished, a rite was prescribed by Vedic texts in which a barren cow (called Anūbandhyā) was sacrificed for Mitra and Varuņa. But later on this was condemned and in lieu of a cow. amikşā ( mixture of heated milk and curds ) was substituted. Vide H. D. II. pp. 1200-1201 for the anūbandhyā cow and p. 628 n. 1198 above for the verse quoted by the Mit. on Yaj. II. 117 condemning cow sacrifice in Kaliyuga. Yāj. III. 234 puts govardha ( slaughter of a cow ) at the head of upapā takas. Medhātithi on Manu IV. 176 after stating that even such acts as donating all one's property in the Visvajit sacrifice or killing a cow should not be done ( though sanctioned by the Veda) remarks that he gives that explanation following his predecessors' views but that to him it appears that an express śruti toxt cannot be set aside by a smrti passage 1679. Višvarūpa also ( on pp. 25-26 ) after adverting to the fact that Yāj. III. 234 places govadha at the head of Upapatakas remarks that this may apply to the killing of cows spoken of in smrtis such as at the time of samāvartana (vide Manu III. 3) and that the rule must be upheld that a smrti that is, in confict with an express text of the Veda is to be set aside. Sometimes even a smrti text though theoretically weaker than śruti was allowed to prevail over a śruti. For example, the Veda prescribes the filling of the cups of wine in Sautrāmaņi işți, but this is one of the matters prohibited in Kali 1680 (vide cliapter on Kalivarjyas below). 

The general rule is that when a custom or usage is opposed to the text of the Veda the latter must prevail. So early a writer as Āpastamba states this rule emphatically in several places. In Āp. Dh. 8. I. 1. 4. 8 it is stated 1681 : "For, an ex plicit śruti text has greater force than ācāra (usage) from which a śruti text (on which it may be supposed to be based )

may be inferred.' In I. 11. 30. 8-9 Ap. Dh. S. gays, during the morning and evening twilights a snātaka should be seated outside the village and should restrain his speech ( should not speak about worldly matters ); but (an agnihotrin must not go out for) what is enjoined by sruti is of more force in case of conflict of duties'. Similarly in Ap. II. 9. 23. 8-9, 'It is the settled view of those who are deeply learned in the three Vedas that they are (highest) authority. They consider that the rites which are there prescribed for performance with rice, yuva, animals, clarified butter, inilk, potsherds ( in conjunction) with the wife and accompanied by loudly or inaudibly recited (mantras ) must be performod and that a usage opposed to these rites is without authority'. In spite of this and the doctrine of the Pūrvamiināmsā stated above (p. 843) usages sprang up that were opposed to or gave the go-by to the prescriptions of the Veda as will appoar a little below and particularly in the section on Kalivarjya. 

The conflict of sınţtis among themselves presents much greater difficultiex. From very ancient times authors of smrtis differed greatly among themselves. A few striking examples may be cited: Āp. Dh. S. (1. 6. 19. 2-12) cites the views of ten predecessors on the question of the persons whose food may be partaken of by a brāhmana (kui iiśyānnuh). The difference between Gautama and Baudhāyana on the one hand and Āp. on the other on the question of the validity of certain usages in certain localities has already been referred to (p. 858). In III. 16 Manu mentions three views ( and four sages) on the question of the position of a brālmana who marries a ģüdra wife or has a son or a child from her. Baud. Dh. S. I. 8.2, Manu III. 13, Vişnu Dh. S. 24. 1-4, Pār. Gr. I. 4, Vas. I. 25 show that brāhmāņas were allowed to have südra women as wives. But Yāj. 1. 56 empha tically dissents from this by stating 'this is not my view'. In this state of affairs the medieval digests and commentators were hard put to it to evolve rules of interpretation. One rule early evolved was that when two smrti texts were in oonfict, * reasoning based on the practices of elders ( śistas ) was of grea tor force' (Yaj. II. 21 ) 1682. The Mit. explains that ratiocina

tion may take the form of holding that one text lays down a general rule and the other lays down a special rule(which prevails over a general rule ), or the text may be held to relate to diffe. rent sets of circumstances or in the last resort it may be held that there is an option, but in arriving at these conclusions the practice of the old or of śistas who follow the rule in one text and discard or avoid the rule in the other text is the guide 1683. Br. 1684 gives the following warning to those who do not take reasoning into consideration: The decision (in a cause ) should not be given by merely relying on śāstras, for in the case of a decision devoid of reasoning loss of dharına results'. Nār. ( L. 40 ) provides in a strain similar to the Mit., 'wlien there is conflict between two texts of dharmaśāstra, it is declared that the method to adopt is to resort to reasoning, for the practices (of śistas ) are of great force and the strict letter of the law is overruled by them (or properly understood through them)'. These provisions remind us of the working of the principle of requitus applied by the prætors in Rome to the rigid older legislation or the influence of Equity in English Law. When

Surajranı 33 Bom. 433 at p. 439 Yāj, II, 21 is rendered as 'where there is a conflict between two or more smrtis that one should be accepted, which is conformable to equity', The former rendering is rather obscure and the latter does not translate Yaj, closely. The exact meaning of' equity' in this translation is not clear. It certainly does not mean equity' in the strict sense of English Law.

old rules become too narrow or are deemed to be not in harmony with the views of a changing or progressive society, it was thought to be the privilege of the king or the judge to adopt his practice to the existing state of society and not to decide a case by a too strict adherence to ancient dicta. 

Another rule that was laid down was that in case of con flict between dharmaśāstra and arthaśāstra, the fornier is of more weight or authority or that one should discard the rule in 

the arthaśāstra 1685 (Ap. Dh. S. I. 9. 24. 23; Yāj. II. 21; Nār. I. 39; Kāt. 20 ). Vide pp. 8-9 above for an explanation of this rule. The rule of the arthaśāstra has the accomplishment of a visible or worldly purpose as the goal, while the dharmaśāstra rule has as its purpose the securing of unseen or spiritual results. Therefore the latter from a spiritual or ethical point of view is superior to the former. 

Soveral other methods of resolving conflicts between smộtis may be mentioned here. Br. 1686 states: 'Manusmrti occupies a pre-eminent position because it puts together the purport of the Vedas; that smrti which is in conflict with the purport of Manu is not commended'. Angiras also states that to follow the words (of another smrti) disregarding the unrivalled dharmaśāstra of Manu would not be beneficial to a person. The Mit. on Yāj. III. 300 speaks of the Manusmrti and others as the great smrtis (maha-smrti). Some writers 1687 quote the Vedic text'whatever Manu said is indeed medicine' in this connec tion, thereby identifying the author of the Manusmrti with the Manu named in the Vedas. But this does not afford much help. Another principle evolved was that certain rules of conduct and certain smrtis were of special authority in certain cycles of time. Manu (I. 85-86 = Santi 232. 27-28 = Parāśara I. 22-23

Usages of several yugas differ 

869 

Brhat-Parāśara I. p. 55) himself says that the dharmas differ according to which of the four yugas is current, viz. tapos is the highest dharma in the Kţta age, knowledge in Tretā, yajña in Dvāpara and only dūna in Kali. This verse only means that in a particular yuga the predominant or easily per formed dharma is the one indicated but the verse does not mean that a dharma predominant in one yuga was prohibited in another. Parāśara I. 24 1688 ( = Bphat-Parāśara I. p. 55) declares that in the Krta age the dharnas (to be observed ) were those promulgated by Manu, in Tretā those of Gautama, in Dyāpara those of Sankha-Likhita and in Kali those of Parasara. This also did not solve all difficulties, since the medieval digests and commentaries found that even what was allowed by Parāśara came to be disapproved of or condemned by the people. Many prescriptions of the smộtis were therefore included under Kali ruerjyn (acts forbidden in the Kali age) on the ground that action, though at one time prescribed or sanctioned by the sāstra, should not be resorted to, if it has become hateful to the people, since it would not lead to heaven 1689 (if persisted in). This was the dictum of Yaj. I. 156 ( = Bphan-Nāradiya-purāna 24.12 ), Manu IV. 176, Vişņu Dh. S. (71. 84-85), the Vişnupurana (III. 11.7 ), Sukra III. 64, Bārhaspatya-sūtra ( on Arthaśāstra ) V. 16. Vide p. 630 and n. 1202 above. These texts were relied upon for prohibiting certain acts (though done in former times) by the Mit. (on Yāj. II. 117, III. 18), V. P. (p. 442 ) and others, But these devices of interpretation also proved futile in certain cases. On the question of the periods of mourning due to death for ksatriyas and others the texts are so various and so confic ting that even the great Vijñāneśvara declares (on Yāj. III. 22 ) that he is not going to furnish any orderly presentation of the smrti texts assigning to each its proper province, since it would be useless to do so in view of the fact that the usage of śiştas did not agree with most of them 1690. Viśvarüpa also (on Yaj. III. 30) is in the same predicament. The commentators (such as

Madhava in Par. M. on I. 1. p. 84) were aware that people would not go in for religious practices that called for great effort and would seek for such rules as would be easy of observance. 1691 

In some cases it was provided tliat where there is a conflict among smptis the view of the majority should prevail. Gobhila sinrti (III. 148-149) provides 1692 that where there is a conflict among passages (of smrtis ), authoritativeness rests with that view which is supported by a majority of the texts, but where two passages are of equal authority then reasoning has to be einployed. The assumption or axiom was, according to Medha tithi1693 ( on Manu II. 29 and XI. 216), Mit. (on III. 325), Sun, C. (I. p. 5), Apararka p. 1053, Madanapārijāta (pp. 11, 91 ) and otliers that all smộtis form one śāstra, that if some smrti texts on the same subject are in conflict there is an option and when there is no conflict all rules from all smrtis should be held applicable to the subject matter; this was based on the analogy of the maxiin called 'sarva-sākhāpratyayanyāya' or 'sākhān taradhikarana ' ( vide Jai. II. 4.9 and Sabara thereon). 

It is further provided that works of heretical sects were to be left out of consideration. Manu calls thern emptis, but they 

are outside the pale of Vedic orthodoxy. Manu (XII. 95) declared, 1694 + the smrtis that are outside the ( pale of) Veda. and all false or fallacious doctrines are of no avail after death, because they are all based on ignorance'. In the Vedantasūtra (II. 1. 1) also the word smrti is applied to the works on the

Heretical works have no authority 

871 

Sankhya philosophy. The Tantravārtika (p. 195) says that the Bauddhas and other heretical sects do not admit that their doctrines are based on the Veda, like a bad son hating his parents ; the prescriptions contained in their works are opposed to all the 14 vidyās except in the case of a few sentences laying down restraint of senses, charity and the like; they were proinulgated by persons like the Buddha who had given up the path of the Veda and did acts contrary to the Veda and they were propounded to persons that were beyond the pale of the three Vedas and that mostly were sūdras and persons outside the system of the four varnas and āšrainas. Medhatithi on Manu II. 6 adopts this and remarks 1695 that the Sākyas, Bhojakas and Ksapapakas do not admit the Veda as authoritative, they openly declare the Veda to be unauthoritative and they teach doctrines directly opposed to the Veda. The Caturvimšatimata 1696 states that the words of Arhat (Jina), of Cārvāka and of Bauddhas, should be abandoned as they lead to delusion. 

Then comes the question of the conflict between smstis and purānas. It has been shown in the H, of Dh., vol. I. pp. 160–167, how the Purāņas are rich in Dharmaśāstra material. The sūtras and early smrtis do not look upon the Purāņas as a source of dharma, though Gaut. XI, 19 and Yāj. I. 3 mention Purāpa as one of the classes of works on which the king or any one else may draw for knowledge of dharma and though the Āp. Dh, S. quotes from a Purana in 1. 6. 19. 13, 1. 10. 29. 8 and II. 9. 23. 3 and names a Bhavisyatpurāņa in II. 9. 24. 6. It is to be noted that the views quoted by Āp. from the Purānas in the first three passages are opposed to the views of the Kalivarjya section alleged to be taken from the Adityapurāna in medieval digests. The passage of the Tantra vārtika stating that Puranas, Manusmrti and Itihasa are universally accepted throughout India has been already quoted (on p. 853). When Manu states that smrti is a source of dharma he does not obviously com prehend Purāņas under smrti as Manu II. 10 clearly shows ( dharmaśāstrar tu vai smirtih). Manu III. 232 and Yāj. III. 189 employ the plural 'Purāṇāni' and so those smrtis obviously

knew several Purānas and Medhātithi notes that they were composed by Vyāsa and described the creation of the world &c. The Striparva (13.2) also employs the plural and the Svargā rohanikaparva (5. 46-47) speaks of Krsna Draipāyana as the author of 18 Purāņas. The Adiparva 1697 (1. 293-94) prescribes that one should strengthen the Veda by. (the study of) the Itihāsa and Purāṇa and that the Veda fears the man whose knowledge is insignificant 'this man will harm me'. Accord ing to the Bhāgavata-purāņa I. 4. 25 the purpose 1698 of the composition of the Mahābhārata was this that as the Veda cannot be learnt by women, sūdras and brāhmaṇas who are so only by birth ( and do not study) the sage Vyāsa took com passion on them and composed the Mahābhārata for their bene fit. The same must be deemed to be the purpose of the com position of the purāņas. The Dakşasmrti II. 69 prescribes 1699 the recitation of itihāsa and purāņa in the 6th and 7th parts of the day (divided into 8 parts). The Aušanasa smrti (III. p. 515, Jivananda) prescribes the study of the Veda in the bright half of the months from Māgha after utsarjana and the study of the Vedāngas and of Purāna in the dark half. It appears that some at least of the extant Purāņas were composed in the first centuries of the Christian era and that from early times they contained dharmaśāstra material. In another section the paurānadharina will be separately dealt with hereafter. Gradually the Puranas became very popular in the course of centuries, some of the original rites prescribed by the Veda and the early smrtis went out of vogue and new modes of worship and rites provided by the Purānas came into general obser vance, The Vedavyāsa smrti 1700 (1. 4) and the Sangraha state that in case of conflict between smrti and purāņa smrti is to be

· preferred. Aparārka (p. 9) quotes 1701 a smrti text, 'that is highest dharma which is understood from the Veda, that is to be known as inferior dharma that is declared in the Purāņas and the like'. Aparārka (p. 15) further tells us that 1702 accor ding to the Bhavisyatpurāņa the purāņas are of authority in declaring dharma that is vyāmišra (i. e. mixed up and not purely Vedic). Medieval writers were often divided as to the authoritativeness of purāņas. Mitramisra (in his commen tary 1903' on Yāj. II. 21) asserts that dharmaśāstra (viz. smsti) is not more authoritative tha n purāna and that in case of con flict between a smrti text and a purana text recourse must be had to reasoning as in the case of conflict between two smptis. On the other hand, the V. Mayūkha, 1704 after quoting Manu IX. 126 and Devala about the first born among twins being regarded as the oldest and after referring to a half verse from the Bhagavatapurāna (rather from the commentary of Sridhara thereon) which holds that among twins the one born later is to be deemed as the elder, remarks that the Purāņa passage is to be set aside in favour of the sinsti passages and that in the purāņas usages opposed to the smrtis are very frequently met with. It further says that this view is preferable to that of some others according to whom in this matter the custom of the country should be followed. The Nirnayasindhu (III. p. 251 ) also says the same. The respect for the purāṇas carried away late medieval writers so far that relying on some pro phetic passages in the purāņas about the disappearance of four varpas in the Kali age and the subsistence of only brāh manas and sūdras therein, they denied the existence of ksatriyas and vaisyas in the Kali age, in spite of the fact that all smộtis (like Manu, Yāj., Parāsara) and many commentaries (including the Mitākşarā) hold that the four varnas exist in the Kali age.

The case of conflict between smộti and customs has now to be considered. The general rule deduced from Vas. I. 5, Yāj. I. 7 and supported by the Mit. (on Yāj. I. 7 and II. 117), the Sm, C. ( II. p. 266 ), Kullūka (on Manu. II. 10 ) and several others is that smtři is of superior authority to the usages of the siştas. But from early times there have been dissenting voices. Visvarūpa on Yāj. III. 250 states that that purport of the smrtis is to be followed which is in accordance with the settled practice of the sistas resident in Aryāvarta 1705. On Manu IV. 176 Medhatithi points out that niyoga is permitted by such omstis 1706 a8 Gaut. 18.4-14, Yāj. I. 68-69, Vas. 17. 56-65, but being condemned by the people it is not practised. There fore the principle that may be deduced from these is that the prescriptions of smộtis ( and oven of śruti) need not be observed and should not be observed when they are vehemently condemned by the people. The chapter on Kalivarjya will make this clear, Commentators like Medhātithi (on Manu II. 10) went 80 far as to say that Dharmasastra is that which prescribes what is to be done for attaining dharma, that is smrti from which dharma which one performs as a duty is understood and there fore sistā cāra 1707 also is smrti. The smrtis theinselves embodied the practices of the people current in their days, as Manu I. 107 declares, ' in this work dharma has been fully stated as well as the good and evil qualities of (human ) actions and the ancient customs and usages of the four varņas.' 1708 Manu adds (I. 108), 

acara ( customs and usages) are transcendental law, and so are the practices declared in the Veda and the smrti; therefore a twice-born person desirous of his own welfare should always

make efforts to follow it '. 1709 This has been the basic text in modern decisions that recognize the binding nature of customs. It is therefore necessary to understand the exact meaning of this verse. Two constructions are possible; (1) that the word ācāra is qualified by the words. śrutyukta' and 'smārta' and that the first half declares that usages declared in the Veda or smrti are transcendental law (this is the meaning given by most commentators of Manu ); (2) that acāra by itself and other rules of conduct declared in the sruti or smrti are transcen dental (i. e. here in the first half of the verse there is a reference to three kinds of ācāras, as Govindaraja and Nandana explain ). If we look to the preceding verse and the following verses ( that eulogise ācāra ) the 2nd construction looks more natural and has been accepted by the decided cases when 1710 they lay down that * immemorial usage is transcendental law' (Sir William Jones' translation of Manu I. 108) and that "under the Hindu system of law clear proof of usage will outweigh the written text of the law". The Anuśāsana (141. 65) and Santi 354. 6 expressly state that dharma is threefold viz. that declared in the Veda, that declared in the smrtis and the third is what is practised by sistas. Sumantu 1711 emphatically declares that family usage should be preferred to the prescriptions of sāstra. The Kūrmapurāņa 1712 ( Uttarardha 15. 19) appears to support the and interpretation when it says, 'one should observe that acara which is declared by the sruti and smrti and which is rightly followed by the good'. The exact import of the word acāra (or gadācāra ) has been shifting from age to age and among com mentators. In the earliest days, as shown by the Tai. Up., Gaut. (28. 48, 51 ), Baud. Dh. 8.

History of Dharmasastra 

[Vol. 

Vas. I. 6, the acāra to be followed was that observed or declared by learned brāhmanas who were highly moral and selflegs (the ģistas ). Medhatithi on Mann II. 6 states that binding acāra is that of sistas learned in the Vedas. Gradually every usage that had no visible secular purpose came to be looked upon as binding and lastly the usages of südras, of pratiloma castes and even of heterodox sects became, as will be shown in the sequel, enforceable by the king. As observed in 39 Mad. 298, 301 the commentarios indicate an attempt to reconcile the text law with the actual usages of the people. 

The requisites of valid customs, according to the smrtis and commentaries and digests, are similar to those laid down by the writers on Pūrvamimāmsā i, e, they must be ancient, must not be opposed to sruti and smrti, must be such that they are regard ed by respectable people as obligatory on them and such as are observed with that consciousness by the sistas, they must be strictly construed and cannot be availed of by others not within their purview and must not be immoral or severely condemned by popular sentiment. Customs once in vogue may be abandon ed by the people as the chapter on Kalivarjya will show. 

From Gaut., Manu, Bp., Kāt. and other writers quoted above it follows that the customs and usages of which account has to be taken are those of districts ( deśa or janapada ), towns and villages, castes, families, guilds or corporations or groups (gana, śrepi, sangha, naigama, varga). A few words on each of these and on usages of gotrus and sākhas will be said later on and a few illustrations of each will be given. But first of all certain preliminary observations have to be made about customs in general. The medieval writers on Dharmaśāstra make it clear that customs that depart from the generally received smrti prescriptions must be strictly construed and that they cannot be extended on the ground of analogy to other matters outside the specific acknowledged customs. For example, both the Sm. O.(I.. 71) and the Smrtimuktāphala 1713 (on Varpāśrama p. 31) say that, though one's maternal uncle's daughter can be married (by custom) yet one's mother's sister or mother's sister's daughter

cannot be married, because popular sentiment is opposed to the latter kind of marriages and popular sentiment has to be respected as Manu declares (in IV. 176). Similarly the Samskara kaustubha 1714 and the Dharmasindhu provide that where there is a local or family usage for narrowing down the limits of sapiņda relationship in marriage, only those who belong to that locality or family can avail themselves of such narrowing down, but if a person in a different locality or belonging to a different fainily were to follow the practice of narrowing down the sapinda relationship, he would incur blame. Owing to the vastness of Bharatavarşa it was recognised that what was sadācāra in one country would not be so in another, as is noted by the Par. M. (I. 2. p. 65 ) in relation to marriage with one's maternal uncle's daughter,1715 

A few words may now be said about customs of countries. That usages about details of ritual varied a great deal even in the Vedic times is quite clear. The Sat. Br. (1. 1. 4. 13 ) notes that in former times it was the wife of the sacrificer that rose at the Hayişkpt call, but that in its own day the wife or a priest ( the Agnidhra) rises in angwer to the call. Vide H. of Dh. vol. II. p. 1027 and n. 2311 on the Haviskrt call. For similar differences in practices vide the same Brahmana XII. 3. 5.1 and XII. 6. 1. 41. The Ait. Br. frequently refers to one view and refutes it by saying that one should not do so (tat tatha na kuryāt ) or one should discard it (tat tat nādrtyam ) e. g. vide . chap. 12. 7, 17. 1, 18. 8, 28.1, 29.5. Vide also Tai, Br. I. 1. 8, I. 3,1, III. 8.8 for similar words.

noted above (pp. 856-857). Baudhāyana made a distinction about the customs of the northern and southern people ( countries ). That customs of the northern and southern countries differed is emphasized by many commentators and writers of digests. For example, the Mit, on Yāj. I. 256 refers to the differing views of dakšiņātyas and udicyas on Ekoddista-śrāddha. Sankara bhatta in the introductory verses of the Dvaitanirņaya (or Dharma-dvaita-) expressly states that he will furnish solutions of knotty points in Dharmaśāstra after abiding by the views of southern writers. 1716 The Nirnayasindhu in its section on sāpiņdya speaks of Sūlapāņi, Vācaspati and Suddhiviveka as Gaudas and Maithilas, and points out that Sūlapāni in the Sambandha viveka and the Sambandhatattva (a Gauda work) allow marriage with a girl separated by three gotsas from the bride groom, while the southern writers ( dākşiņatyas ) do not accept the view. But in those days there were no rigid territorial boundaries for certain practices or doctrines. For example, Vijñānešvara, Madana-ratna, Pārijāta, Vācaspati and Sūlapāņi accepted the view that sāpindya arises from community of the particles of the body, while Aparārka, Smrticandrika and Madhava ( though they were southern writers like Vijñānesvara) held that sāpiņdya was based on the offering of pinda in śrāddhas. The fashion of dividing Hindu works into schools and assigning them definite territorial limits started with Colebrooke and has been perpetuated by decisions of the Privy Council and of the Indian High courts. Vide Collector of Madura v. Mootoo 12 Mad. I. A. 397 at p. 432 (for reference to Colebrooke), p. 435 ( as to how schools arose ), pp. 436-437 (as to different schools ). Strange results have flowed from this. The Vyavahāra mayükha, written by Nilakaptha, whose family belonged to Paithan in Mahārāstra and migrated to Benares and who himself wrote under the patronage of a Bundella chief, came to be regarded as a work of the highest authority in Gujerat and North Konkan (even superseding the Mitākşarā ), while in Mahārāştra proper its authority is subordinate to that of the Mitakşarā. The Mit. ( on Yāj. II. 119 ) avers that in the section on the partition of heritage the texts generally repeat what is

already current among the people 1717 and that if Yāj. II. 118-119 were interpreted to mean that the words' what is acquired at the cost of paternal estate by a person himself' stand by themselves and do not qualify the other clauses, then what is acquir ed through friendship even at the cost of the paternal estate would not be liable to partition, which would be opposed to the practice among people. The Vyavahāra-mayūkha also 1918 says on Manu IX. 210 ( about reunion) that the law and administra tion of justice are generally based as is the case with grammar on people's usages. The Viramitrodaya also states that all writers of digests are agreed that smrtis on Vyavāhara generally re-iterate recognized popular usages. 

Customs of countries and families have been specially recognized from very ancient times in the sphere of marriage. The Āśv. gr. (I. 7, 1-2 ) has been already cited above (p. 856 ). The commentators on Āśy. gp., Haradatta and Nārāyaṇa, both mention that in certain countries sexual intercourse is com menced immediately after marriage, that this practice is oppos ed to the rule in Aśv. g£. I. 1. 10 that the married couple should be celibate after marriage for at least three nights (if not for a longer period ) and that one should follow the rule laid down in the gļhyasūtra and not the usage of the country. The Āp. gr. (II. 15 ) remarks, 1719 ' people should understand from women (and others ) what procedure is (to be followed according to the custom of the country )' and the commentator Sudarśanā. carya notes that certain rites like the worship of planets, ankurūropana and the tying of pratisara ( a string or ribbon tied round the wrist) are usual and are performed with Vedio Mantras. The Kathakagshya ( 25. 7) allows the usages of countries and families to be observed in marriage and the

commentators mention some usages, viz. Devapāla refers to stat ing the purpose of the visit, announcing the name of the maiden, worship of family deity, striking with flowers and creepers. The com. Brāhmaṇabala states that in Kashmir'at the time of marriage the mother-in-law or some other woman whose husband is alive ties an auspicious wreath on the heads of the bride and the bridegroom, that the mother-in-law places flowers on the feet, knees, shoulders and head of the bridegroom and on the same seven places of the bride's body flowers are placed but in the reverse order ( i. e. first on the left limb and then on the right), 

Haradatta on Gaut. XI. 20 (cited above in n. 1662) mentions the following usages: in the Cola country while the sun is in the zodiacal sign of Aries maidens draw with powders of various colours on the ground an orb of the sun together with attendants and offer worship in the morning and evening; on the full moon day of Margasirşa maidens putting on ornaments walk about in the village and offer to a temple idol whatever they get in their wanderings; when the sun is in the sign of the Crab, maidens worship the goddess Umā while the moon is in the constellation of the Pūryā Phalgunis and offer to the gods mudga beans that have put forth sprouts and salt; when the sun is in the sign of Pisces, house-holders worship the Goddess of wealth while the moon is in the constellation of Uttarā Phalguni, Ap. Dh. S. II. 6. 13,7 notes that in certain countries the special portions of the eldest son in paternal wealth are gold, dark-coloured cattle and black-coloured produce of the soil (i. e. black grain). Vide Bp. and Tantravārtika quoted above ( as to customs of certain countries). 

Several such illustrations may be furnished from other writers, but considerations of space make it necessary to omit reference to them. 

The Pār. gr.,8. 1 8 states 1720 that the usages of villages may be followed, since a text says 'one should enter a village (i. e, follow the opinion of village elders ) in case of marriage and funeral rites' and since the Veda says that 'the village is the authority in these two.'

Caste customs 

881 

Numer ous caste customs have been recognized from ancient times to these days. Gaut. XI. 20, Vas. I. 17, Manu I. 118, VIII. 41 and 46, Kaut. III. 7, Sukra IV. 5. 47 emphasize the validity of caste customs and call upon the king to enforce them. Yaj. I. 361 advises the king to punish those who swerve from the usages of their family, caste, guild, or group. Katya yana (40) enjoins 1721 that the king should not disregard the fixed usages even of pratiloma castes and of the inhabitants of inaccessible places (mountain forts or habitations ), even if they be opposed ( to the rules of smrtis ). In the Paribhāsa prakasa Mitramiśra holds 1722 that the usages of good sūdras, free from moral defects are binding on their sons and others even though they do not know the Veda. 

Compared to Western Christian countries very great religious tolerance prevailed in ancient India. Vide H. of Dh. vol. II. pp. 388 (n. 928 a), 723-724 for some remarks on this. Asoka in his Pillar Edict VII (E. I. vol. II. p. 272 ) says that he looked after sanghas, brāhmaṇas, Ājivakas and all other sects (pāşanda ). The Bhagavadgitā (IX. 23-25 ) proclaims that the devotees that worship other gods do worship Krsna himself though in an irregular way and that those who offer worship to the Manes or to the elements reach the goals they desire. The Mānasollasa enjoins 1723 that one should give up condemnation of or hatred towards other gods, that one should show reverence on seeing an image or a temple and should not pass it over (in contempt ). People of different countries no doubt twitted each other on the customs and usages peculiar to each; but it rarely went beyond the bandying of words. For example, even such a

philosophical work as the Jivanmuktiviveka remarks 1724 that brahmanas of the south condemn even the learned brāhmaṇas of the north as flesheaters and brāhmaṇas of the north condemn southern brāhmaṇas because they marry their maternal uncle's daughters and because they carry earthen vessels in fairs or on pilgrimages. It was on account of the general attitude of religious tolerance that the smrtis and digests prescribe that open the usages of heretical sects should be enforced by the king. Yāj. II. 192 prescribes 1725 that the king should guard against breach of the distinctive usages and conventions of guilds (of artisans), of traders, of heretical sects and bands (of soldiers). Narada (samayasyānapakarma 1-3) states 1736 that the king should uphold the conventions of heretical sects, of traders, guilds and other groups and that whatever traditional usages, activities, mode of attendance and means of maintenance were peculiar to them should be permitted to them by the king without introducing any change. Among the matters of which the king was to take cognizance suo motu and included under prakirņaka by Nārada (verse 2) was the transgression of the usages of heretics, traders, guilds and ganas, Brhaspati provides 1721 that in disputes among husbandmen, artisans, wrestlers, money lenders, guilds, dancers, heretics, thieves, a decision is to be given in accordance with their conventions. It is no doubt true that certain smrtis present a sterner treatment of heretics and

Treatment of heretics and the like

the like. Gaut. IX. 17 provides 1723 that a snataka should not talk with mlecchas, impure persons and sinners. Manu IX, 225 prescribes that the king should banish from his capital gamblers, dancers, heretics, vintners &c. Manu IV.30 holds that one should not honour as guests even by words persons who are heretios, rogues &c. and recommends that one should not reside in a country which is overrun by groups of heretics. Yāj. II. 70 and Nār. (rņādāna 180 ) say that a heretic (pākhandi) or an atheist is not a proper witness. These passages may be explained in various ways. Probably the prescriptions of Gautama and Manu refer to an age when the schism caused by Buddhists and Jainas was not very old and feelings between the followers of the Veda and the heretics ran high. But most of these prescrip tions are addressed to the followers of the Veda as individuals. They do not negative the requirements laid down by Nār., Br. and others that the king ( though of a different persuasion ) was to enforce among heretics their own usages. It can be said without any fear of contradiction that at least from the 4th century A. D. onwards the policy of the State in India was to protect all religions, but to interfere with none '. 1729 

Customs of families will be briefly referred to later on in connection with modern law cases. Among family customs the customs about the year when caula was performed and the locks of hair kept on the head in the caula ceremony are frequently mentioned in the gphya sūtras and other works. Vide H. of Dh, 

vol. II pp. 260 and 265. 

The digests contain numerous examples about the customs and usages that were adhered to among the followers of the several Vedic branches (sākkās) and the gphya gūtras in perform ing several religious rites. A few examples may be set out here by way of illustration. According to Yaj. L 242 the offering of pindas to the pitss in a sraddha takes place after the brahmapas invited at the śrāddha are fed, while Manu III. 261 shows that they were offered also before the brāhmaṇas were fed. The Sm. C. (on śrāddha p. 471) says that one should follow the practice of one's own Vedic sakha. Among the five daily sacrifices ( mahāyajfias) one is pitryajña, which aco, to some ( such as Katyāyana ) means tarpaņa, while according to Manu

ILI, 81 it means śrāddha and the Sm. C. (I. p. 208 ) provides that one should follow one's sākhā. The same remark applies to the number of handfuls of water offered in tarpana (Sm. C. I p. 191 and Madanapārijāta p. 286 ). About the month of pregnancy in which the ceremony of sīmantonnayana was to be performed each person was to follow his own grhyasūtra (Sm. O. I. p. 17, and Par. M. I. part 2 p. 22). The same holds good as to the day of nāmakarana (Sm. O. I. p. 21, Par, M. I. part 2 p. 25). It is not necessary to multiply examples. According to Gaut. XI. 21-22 and others already cited above, the king has to enforce the usages of guilds ( śreņi) and corporations. Several such usages have been cited above ( pp. 487-488). 

CHAPTER XXXIV 

KALIVARJYA 

(ACTIONS FORBIDDEN IN THE KALI AGE. ) 

It has been stated above (pp. 865-866 ) that one of the several ways in which the conflict between several smộti texts was got over was to hold some of them as legislating for a bygone age (yugāntara ). For example, when Hārsta allowed upanayana to women, both the Sm. C. (1. 24 ) and Par. M. (1. 2. p. 83 ) hold that the text refers to another kalpa (aeon). In H. of Dh. vol. II. (on pp. 151, 162, 424, 451, 603,612, 620,750,790, 796, 928, 929,934,953, 1005 n, 1201 n) reference has been made to several matters forbidden in the Kali age. It is remarkable in this connection to note that, though the Parāśarasmrti ( in I. 24 ) claims par excellence to lay down the dharmas for the Kali age, several inportant provisions contained in it, viz. the remarriage of a married woman 1730 (Parāsara IV. 30), the variation in the period of impurity due to births and deaths depending on the learning and character of a brāhmaṇa Parāśara II. 5-6), permission for a brāhmaṇa to partake of the food of five classes among südras (XI. 21 ) are included among Kalivarjyas by the Adityapurāņa (as quoted by writers of the 12th and later centuries ). It is necessary, therefore, to investigate into the origin and development of the Yuga theory and of the topic of Kalivarjya. 

From the Mahabharata (Santi 59 ), Manu (1. 81 ), Nārada (I. 1-2), Bţhaspati and the Purāṇas it is clear that they all believed in the existence of an ideally perfect community in the dim past followed by gradual degeneracy and decline in morals, health and lengti of life. But they also believed that a.cycle of decline would be followed in the far distant future

by another of moral perfection. The only pity is that all works that are extant think that they are in the midst of a very sinful age and there is not a single work which thinks that the era of perfection may dawn in the very near future, 

The germ of the theory of progressive deterioration in morals is found even in the Rgveda. In the famous dialogue of Yama and Yami the former exclaims in one place 1731 (Rg. X. 10. 10) 'those later ages are yet to come when sisters would do what is not sister-like'. The word 'yuga' occurs at least 33 times in the Rg., but the exact meaning is somewhat doubt ful. In a few places it means yoke'( Rg. X. 60. 8, X. 101. 3 and 4). In several places it appears to stand for a very brief period of time ( e. g. Rg. III. 26. 3). Generally it means 'a generation' (as in Rg. I. 92. 11, I. 103, 4, I. 124. 2, II. 2.2, III. 33. 8, V. 52. 4). In Rg. I. 158. 6 'dirghatamā māmateyo jujurvān dasame yuge'yniga probably means 'a period of four or five years ', while in Rg. VI. 15. 8, VI. 8. 5, X. 72. %, X, 94. 12, X. 97. 1 it should mean 1732 ' a long period of time'. In the Atharvaveda VIII. 2. 21 yuga appears to mean a period of several thousand years, two yugas being indicated as longer than 10000 years ( satam tesyutam hāyanān dve yuge tiņi catvāri krnmah). Here there is a clear reference to four yugas and to the fact that yuga' meant a very long period of time. What ever be the meaning of the word in each passage, the Rgveda doos not contain the names of all the four well-known yugas viz. Kșta, Tretā, Dvāpara and Kali. The word “Kfta' when used in the Rgveda appears to mean 'the best throw of dice or of the seeds of vibhitaka in gambling '(X. 34. 6, X. 43. 5). In the Atharvaveda VII. 52. %, 5, 6 kpta has the same meaning. Kali is the name of the author of Rg. VIII. 66 and in verse 15

of that hymn we read "kalayo mā bibhitana' (O descendants of Kalil do not be afraid ). In Rg. X. 39. 8 the Asvins are said to have rejuvenated Kali who had become old. Vide also Rg. I. 112. 15 ( where Kali is said to have got a wife from Ašving ). But Kali as a throw of dice does not occur in the Rgveda. In the Atharvaveda VII. 114. 1 Kali 1733 means a throw of dice. The words kyta, treta, dvūpara and āskanda occur in the Tai. S. IV. 3. 3, Vāj. S. 30. 181734 and in the Sat. Br. XIII. 6. 2. 9-10 (S. B. E. vol. 44 p: 416). In later literature Kali is also called Tişya (as in Bhişmaparva 10. 3). In the Tai. Br. III. 4. 16 the word Kali is used 1735 in place of Askanda. In all the above places Kfta and the other three words denote throws in gambling, Krta being the most lucky and Kali being the most unlucky. In another passage of the Tai. 1736 Br. (1.5.11) we read the four stomas (Trivrt, Pañcadaśa, Saptadasa and Ekavimša) are Krta and the five are Kali; therefore the catuscoma (should be performed in the Jyotiştoma). This shows that Kșta meant a throw of four or any multiple of four and Kali a throw which when divided by four left one as remainder. The Aitareya Br. employs the words Kļta 1737 and the other three in a metaphorical sense as representing progres. sively more desirable states of human activity, one lying down becomes Kali, when about to leave the bed he becomes Dvāpara, when rising he becomes Tretā, and when he moves about he

becomes Krta'. The Sat. Br. V. 4. 4. 6 speaks of Kali 1738 as * abhibhu' (the vanquisher ) and suggests that Kali ig a throw of five that vanquishes all others. In the Chan, Up. IV, 1, 4 it is said 'as (in a game 1739 of dice ) all the lower throws are included in the Krta throw which becomes victorious, so to him (to Raikva ) comes ( the merit of all the good acte that people do'. Here Sankara explains that Kṛta is a throw of dice having four marks, while other throws that have three, two or one mark are called Trotā, Dvāpara and Kali respectively. The Mundaka Up. I. 2. 1 refers to Tretā 1740. 'This is the truth; the sacrificial rites which the sages saw in the mantras ( i. e. as presoribed in the hymns of the Rgveda and other vedas) have been performed in many ways in the Tretā! This last word is explained by Sankarācārya in two ways, first as referring to the threefold priestly duties (of hots, adhvaryu and udgātr ) which are based on the three Vedas and alternatively as refer ring to the Tretā age. From this resume it appears that even up to the times of the latest period of Vedic literature (i. e. Upanişads) the words Kļta, Tretā, Dvāpara and Kali were used in the sense of throws of dice in gambling and that it is very doubtful whether they were used in the sense of different ages of the world. Even in the Mahabharata Křta 1741 and Dvāpara are used also in the sense of throws of dice ( vide Virāta 50. 24). In the Gopatha Brāhmaṇa (I. 28 ) there is a reference to the beginning of the Dvāpara age. 

Even in the Vedānga Jyotisa1742 (of Rg.) the word yuga is used in the sense of a period of five years (pañcasamvatsaramayar

yugādhyaksam prajāpatim). The ancient Pitāmahasiddhanta which is not now extant, stated, according to the Pancasid dhāntikā of Varahamihira (XII. 1), that yuga means five years of the Sun and the Moon (ravišasinoh pañca 'yugam varşāņi Pitāmahopadiştāni). This sense of the word is still found in the Sabhāparva 11. 38. 

The Nirukta (I. 20) distinguishes between ancient sages and those of later days in the words, 1743 'the (ancient) sages had an intuitive perception of dharma and they imparted the Vedic mantras by instruction to later (sages) who had no intuitive perception of dharma'. But it does not mention or refer to any theory of four yugas. Both Gaut. I. 3-4 and Āp. Dh. S. II. 6. 13. 7-9 give expression to the view that among sages of old transgressions of dharma and violent actions are observed, but that on account of their distinguished spiritual greatness they incurred no sin, while a person of later days, being weak in spiritual merit, should not imitate them, otherwise he would come to grief. Here a distinction is drawn between very ancient sages and later sages as regards the endowment of spiritual merit, but nothing is said about the names or the theory of the four yugas. Āp. Dh. S. I. 2. 5. 4 further says 1744 that sages are not born among men of later days (avaresu) on account of the transgressions of religious ordinances (prevalent in later ages). Therefore, it would not be quite wrong to assume that the theory had not been fully developed even in the times of the early dharmasutras of Gaut. and Ap. even though both held that they were living in an age of decline and that sages coming after the authors of the mantras were inferior. 

Here epigraphic evidence affords some help in fixing the lower limit of the period when the theory of yugas must have been developed. 

In the Rock Edicts of Asoka No. 4 and No. 5 we have at Kalsi and two other places the words 'āva kapam' (yāvat kalpam) and at Girnar the words 'ava samvata kapa' which mean up to the end of the kalpa' or 'up to the end of the kalpa when the clouds or fires of destruction called samvarta

will arise * 1745. Vide C. I. I vol. I. pp. 8, 10, 30-33. This indi cates that the idea of a kalpa (a vast period of time at the end of which the universe would be dissolved) which is part of the theory of the yugas had been developed in the 3rd century B. C. The Junāgadh Inscription of Rudradāman 1746 (150 A.D.) refers to 'wind the velocity of which was as terrible as that at the end of the yuga'. In certain very early inscriptions of Pallava 1747 kings (of about the 3rd or 4th century A. D.) they are described as always ready to extricate dharma that had sunk deep owing to the evil effects of the Kali age'. In one of the Gupta Inscriptions dated in the 96th year of the Gupta era ( 415-16 A. D.) Dhruvašarman is praised as following the path of righteous conduct which prevailed in Kṛtayuga, 1748 while the Chammak copperplate of the Vākātaka emperor Pravara gena II also speaks of Krtayuga (Gupta Inscriptions No. 55 p. 237 at p. 240). The Talgupda inscription of the early Kadamba king Kakusthavarman refers to Kaliyuga ( E. I, vol. VIII p. 34). It is not necessary to adduce passages from ins. criptions of a later date. From the above it may be said that the theory of yugas and kalpas had begun to take shape at least in the 4th or 3rd century B. C. and that in the first cen turies of the Christian era it had been fully developed. It must have gone through several stages in the course of its develop ment. For example, Brahmagupta (Brābmasphuţa-siddhānta 

XI. 10) states that the theory of yugas, Manus and kalpas set out by Aryabhata was not like that of the smrtis. 

The same conclusion is arrived at from a consideration of the classical Sanskrit literature. The theory of yugas and manvantaras as detailed in the Mahābhārata (Vanaparva chap ters 149, 188, Santi chapters 69, 231-232), Manu chap. I, Vişnu dharma-sūtra XX. 1-21, the Purāpas (such as Vişnu I. 3, VI. 3, Mārkandeya 46, Brahma 229-230, Mateya 142-144) and, astro nomical writers from Brahmagupta is briefly as follows: Krta, Tretā, Dvāpara and Kali comprise together with the period

called sandhyā (that precedes each yuga) and the period call ed sandhyāṁsa ( that follows each yuga) 12000 years, i. e. Krta, Tretā, Dvāpara and Kali extend respectively over 4000, 3000, 2000, 1000 years and sandhya and sandhyamsa of these four extend over 400, 300, 200 and 100 years each (i. e. the sandhyā of Kṛta is 400 years and the sandhyāmśa of Krta is 400 years and so on). But these are divine years. Each divine year is equal to 360 human years. Therefore we have to multiply 12000 by 360 to arrive at the number of human years in the four yugas (i. e. the figure is 4320000). The Kộtayuga with its sandhyā and sandhyāṁsa comes to 1728000 human years, Tretā to 1296000, Dvāpara to 864000 and Kali to 432000. These four yugas are together called sometimes caturyuga (Manu I. 71 ) or simply yuga algo ( Vanaparva 188. 27, Santi 232. 29 ); 1000 of these four yugas constitute a day of Brahmā, which is called Kalpa. The night of Brahmā is of the same duration. At the end of a kalpa the universe is resolved into Brahmā ( and this is called pralaya ) and at the end of Brahmā's night the world is created again. In one day of Brahmā there are 14 Manus and therefore each Manyantara is equal to about 71 caturyugas (1000 divided by 14). The life of Brahmā is 100, out of which half is gone and therefore the present is said to be the 2nd or latter half (dvitiya parārdha) of the life of Brahmā and at present the kalpa that is running is called Vārāha. From the above it will be seen that, according to the Purānas, the universe has been created and dissolved many times and there have been numerous Manyantaras also ( vide Manu I. 80). The four yugas in various ways differ in their characteristics. Kșta is 80 called because it is an age in which everything is fulfilled by every one and nothing is left to be done. 1749 The symbolic colours of the four yugas are respectively white, yellow, red and dark (Vanaparva 189. 32). In Kšta, Dharma prevails in all its perfection and it stands with all its four feet ( dharma being figuratively spoken of as vrşa, 1750 a bull, in Manu VIII. 16 and Vanaparva 190. 9) and it declines or deteriorates by a quarter in each of the following yugas (Manu I. 81-82 

Santi 232. 23–24 ), so that in Kali only one quarter (or one foot) of dharma remains and adharma occupies three quarters. In Krta people are entirely free from diseases, secure all that

they desire and the length of human life is four hundred years, all of which decline by one quarter successively in the follow ing three yugas ( Manu I. 83=Sānti 232. 25 ). The dharmas in each of the four yugas are different ; tapas was the highest in Kyta, philosophic knowledge in Tretā, sacrifice in Dvāpara and charity alone in Kali (Manu I. 85-86 =Parāśara I. 22-23 

Santi 232. 27-28). Manu I. 85, Santi 232. 27 and 261. 8, Parāśara I. 22 all have the same verse stating that the dharmas prescribed for men in each yuga differ. 

In Kṛta, Tretā, Dyāpara and Kali the dharmas ( that should *be observed) are respectively declared by Manu, Gautama, Sankha-Likhita and Parāśara ( Parāśara I. 24). In Krta there was a single varna but at the end of Kali almost all will be śūdras (Brahma 229. 52, Matsya 144. 78). Parāśara (I. 25-28 ) points out other characteristics of the four yugas, which need not be detailed here. Manu IX. 301 and 30%, however, indicate that the yugas are not watertight parts of Time. It is the king who can by his conduct introduce the characteristics of one yuga into another. Medhātithi on Manu IX. 301 explains that the king should not be misled into thinking that Kali is a historical part of Time and that he ( the king ) cannot therefore be Kali or Kṛta, but that it is the king's way of conducting himself that will produce the conditions of the several yugas among his people. 

In Vanaparva 149. 11-38, Vāyu 32 and 57-58, Linga 39, Matsya 142-144, Garuda 223, Nāradapurāņa (pürvārdha 41 ) and in several other purāṇas there are descriptions of the nature of the four yugas, which are passed over here. But it is important to see how the Great Epic and the Purānas describe the nature of Kaliyuga. Vanaparva chap. 188 and 190, the Yugapurāna chapter of the Gargasamhitā (published in the J. B. O. R. 8. vol. 14 pp. 400 ff, by K. P.

will deceive worthy husbands, will be of bad character and will have intercourse with slaves and even boasts ; wives of heroes will resort to other men and will be guilty of adultery even while their husbands are alive. 1754 

The dates of the composition of the Purānas not being beyond controversy, it would be difficult to point to a particular period as the time when the full-fledged theory of the yugas was developed. But this much can be stated with certainty that by the 4th century A. D. at the latest the theory had been completely doveloped. Āryabhata 1755 (in Kālakriyāpāda 10 ) states that when three pādas of the yuga ( i. e. Krta, Treta and Dvāpara ) and 3600 years more had elapsed, he was 23 years old' i. e. (accepting the calculations current at present) in 499 A. D. Āryābhata was 23 years old and so was born in 476 A. D. In his Pancasiddhāntikā Varāhamihira 1756 (505 to 587 A. D.) summarises the data of several astronomical 

1754. It would be interesting to compare the descriptions of Kali given in the Mahābhārata and the several Puranas. Some verses are com. mon to several of them and the ideas are almost the same throughout. The principal counts in the indictment are that there will be sūdra and Mleccha kings, that heretical sects will predominate, that the ordered duties and privileges of the several castes will be turned topsyturvy and there will be great physical and moral decline. After Vanaparva chap. 188 there is an additional description in chap. 190 of what will happen in the Kali age, which appears, from the express words of Vanaparva 191, 16, to have been taken from the Vāyupurāna. So this chapter is a later interpolation. The verse EIGT &c. occurs agaio in Vanaparva 190. 52 and also in Harivansa (Bhavisyaparva 3. 12), Brahmapurāņa 230. 11. Matsya 47. 258

Kalidasa 1758 in Raghuvamsa 15. 96 speaks of dharma as having only three feet ( in Tretā ) when Rāma made up his mind to depart from this world. No scholar will assign to Kālidāsa a date later than the middle of the 5th century A. D. Therefore the theory of yugas must be deemed to have been perfected long before 400 A. D. K. P, Jayaswal holds that the Yugapurāņa chapter of the Garga-samhitā was composed about 50 B, C. (J. B.O.R.S. vol. 14 p. 399 ) and he is probably right. 

At present it is the practice to hold Kali 5046 (expired) as equal to 1945 A. D. or śake 1867 or saivat 2001-2. But it appears that there were several views about the date of the beginning of the Kaliyuga. The exact starting point on the above computa tion was Friday, 18th February 3102 B. C. One view was that Kaliyuga was about to begin when the great Mahābhārata war was fought out. 1759 This view is expressed in the Aihole Inscription which appears to equate the beginning of Kali with the Bhārata war and states that 3735years ( expired) from the Bhārata war are equal to 556 years of the saka era, 1760 Arya bhata know this computation, since he says that he was 23 years old when three parts of the ( great) yuga and 3600 had elapsed ( Kāla-kriyāpāda, verse 10). Another view set forth in the Purāṇas is that Kaliyuga began when Kșsna finished his avatāru and went to heaven, 1761 This would put the beginning

of Kaliyuga several years after the date arrived at on the first view. 1762 Vide Mausalapatya chap. 1. 13 and 2. 20 for reference to the lapse of 36 years before Krsna's passing away. The Yugapurāņa appears to make Kaliyuga start, on the day Draupadi died ( vide J. B. 0. R. S. vol. 14 p. 400 ). Another view is that of Varāhamihira who says that the constellation of the Great Bear was in Maghā when Yudhisthira was on the throne and that that time is arrived at by adding 2526 years to the saka year. 1963 This would place Yudhisthira in 653 of the Kali age (as calculated at present) and not at the end of Dvāpara and the beginning of Kali. The Rājatarangipi I. 56 quotes the Brhat-sanhitā and holds that Kurus and Pandayas flourished in 653 of the Kali yuga ( I. 51). Great efforts have

Raja Rao in the Bulletin of the Ganganath Jha Research Society, vol. II pp. 125-143, which mentions numerous dates suggested by various scholars. I am not at all convinced of the correctness of Dr. Triveda's conclusions, in spite of the great learning that be brings to bear on the problem. Vide also his paper in 'Bharatiya Vidya', vol.

In 13, 2 Varāhamihira promises that he will dilate on the movements of the seven sages (municāra) according to the opinion of Vrddhagarga. It appears that 13.3 is his own verse. Garga held the opinion that the Great Bear remained in one constellation for one hundred years. That is all, Utpala quotes the verse of Garga, but it is in the Agustubh metre. It was believed by the authors of the Puranas and even by such astronomers as Varāhamihira that the constellation of the Great Bear remained in each naksatra for a hundred years. Vide Br. Sam. 13.4, Bhāgavata XII. 2. 27-28, Matsya 273. 40-44, Vāyu 99. 421-422, Vişnu IV. 24. 33. Mr. Velandi Gopal Aiyer in .Chronology of Ancient India' (p.75) holds that 'sad-dvika. paāca dvi' means 26 times 25 i. e. 650 years and that we should read

been made by several scholars to meet this discrepancy by explaining the word 'sad-dvika-pañca-dviyutaḥ'( in the Brhat samhita) in various fanciful ways, which are far from satisfactory. There is no reason why dvika should not straightforwardly be taken in the sense of 'two!, 1764 as the Lilāvati and Br. Sam. 71. 5 itself do. 

It is difficult to believe that the Sakakāla referred to in that verse is different from the Sakendrakāla or Sakbhūpakāla, which the Pancasiddhantika (I. 8) and the Bșhat-samhita ( 8. 20-21) make use of in several places. At least Varābamihira gives no such indication, Mr. C. V. Vaidya in his 'Maha bhārata, a criticism' pp. 80-81 holds that the Sakakāla referred to in the verse asan maghāsu &c.' is the era of Buddha's Nirvāṇa. There is hardly any warrant for this assumption, His interpretation of 'sad-dyika-panca-dviyutaḥ as meaning 2566 (and not 2526 ) is not bad and does not seriously affect the argument about the date of Yudhisthira. On that interpretation Yudhisthira would be placed in 2488 B. C. (instead of in 2448 B. C.). But there is no reason why the usual values of sat (six ), dvika ( two ) and other words should not be understood to be meant here, 

The data contained in the Nidhanpur plates of Bhaskara varman (E. I. vol. XII p. 65), when properly scrutinized, appear to favour the position of Varāhamihirā. Those plates in sett ing out the genealogy of Bhāskaravarman start with Naraka, whose son Bhagadatta fought on the side of the Kauravas in the Mahabharata war and was killed by Arjuna (vide Droņa-, parva chap. 29). Bhagadatta's son is said to have been Vajra. datta. After Vajradatta his descendants ruled over Kāmarūpa for 3000 years and then Puşyavarman, a scion of the Bhaga datta family, became king of Kamarūpa. King Bhāgkara Varman was 12th from Puşyavarman and was a contemporary of Emperor Harsa ( first half of the 7th century A. D.). Taking an average of 20 years for the reign of each ruler, Puşyavarman should be taken as having flourished about the beginning of the 5th century A, D. Adding 3000 years which are alleged by: the plates to have intervened between Puşyavarman and Vajra datta, we arrive at about 2500 B, C, as the time of Vajradatta and therefore approximately of the Mahabharata war. This

Date of the beginning of Kaliyuga

corresponds rather very closely with the statement of Varaha mihira who puts Yudhişthira's reign at 653 Kaliyuga (i. e. 2448 B. C.). On the other hand, if we assume that the Mahā bhārata war was fought in or that Kaliyuga started in 3101 B. C., then Puşyavarman who flourished 3000 years after the Mahābhārata war would have to be placed about 101 B. C. and there will be an interval of about 700 or 750 years between Pusyawarman and Bhāskaravarman. A period of 700 or 750 years for 12 rulers would work at about 60 years for each ruler, which is a very improbable average. Therefore the Nidhanpur plates do not support the hypothesis that the Mahābhārata war was fought about 3101 B, C., but rather support the statement of Varāhamihira that it was fought about 2500 B. C. 

. Another epoch for the Mahābhārata war and the beginning of Kaliyuga is indicated by some passages of historic impor tance found in some of the Purāņas. The Vāyupurāna (99, 4-15) and the Matsyapurana ( 273, 36 ) say that from the birth of Parikşit to the coronation of Mahāpadma (Nanda) a period of 1050 years elapsed, while the Bhagavata XII. 2. 26 assigns 1015 years for the same. There is some mistake in the Purana texts here. The Matsya ( in chap. 271. 17-30 ) enumerates the kings of the Bārhadratha dynasty of Magadha descended from Sahadeva, son of Jarāsandha, and states that the dynasty will rule (i. e, ruled) for a thousand years. Then chap. 272 (verses 1-5) speaks of five kings, who will be followed by the Siśunāka dynasty, that together reigned for 360 years and the last king in which was Mahānandi ( verses 6-13 ) whose son from a sūdra wife was Mahāpadma ( 272. 18). So if the years of these three dynasties are added we get the period of about 1500 years. This is supported by the Bhāgavatapurāņa (IX, 22. 48 and XII. 1-2) and Vāyupurana ( 99. 308-321), which latter says that 32 kings of the Bārhadratha dynasty will rule for 1000, then five Vitihotra kings for 138 years (Pradyota and others ) and then the Saišunāka (Sisunāga in the Bhagavata and in the Brabmānda purāņa III. 74. 134-135 ) dynasty for 362 (in all exactly 1500 years ). The same periods are given by the Vişņupurāņa (IV. 23 and 24 ) and by the Brahmāņdapurāna III. 74. 121-135. ŚrIdhara in his comment on Bhagavata XII. 2. 26 states that the interval between Parīkşit and Nanda is 1498 as the Bhagavata holds that the Saišunāga dynasty ruled for 360 years (XII. 1.4-6). Therefore the proper reading in the Vayupurana or Matsyapurāņa or the Bhagavata should be 'pañcasatottaran' 

goo 

History of Pharmatūstrā . i Vol. 

instead of 'pañcāsaduttaram' or ' pañcadasottaram.' Taking the interval between Parikşit and Nanda to be 1500 years and holding as most modern scholars do that the Nandas flourished in the 4th century B. O., Pariksit, the grandson of Arjuna, the Mahābhārata war and the beginning of Kaliyuga would have to be placed in the 19th century B.O. Therefore there are so far three main different epochs for the Mahābhārata war viz. 3101 B, O., 2448 B, O. and about 1900 B. O. All the three are well attested by evidence dating at least from about the 5th century A. D. One cannot dogmatically say that a certain tradition alone out of these three is the only correct one. All that one can say is that one prefers a particular tradition to the other two. Since the epoch of 1900 B, C. is supported by the Puranas in great detail by citing the names of the several kings and their regnal years I personally regard the epoch of 1900 B. O. for the Mabā bharata war as more probable than the other two. It is best to acknowledge one's inability to assign a certain date to the Mahābhārata war rather than twist plain words or ignore al together inconvenient passages or put on them fanciful or far fetched interpretations. The first desideratum is to prepare critical editions of the important purkņas from the best mgs. material. Even then it is doubtful whether unanimity among scholars can be secured. A scholarly beginning was made by Pargiter in his book " The Purāņa texts of the dynasties of the Kali Age' (1913). He compares the material available in the printed editions of several Purānas and Msg, on the subject of royal dynasties. One cannot or may not agree with many of the assumptions and inferences that he makes or draws, yet one cannot withhold admiration for his industry and method. For example, I cannot agree with him when he takes 'bhavisye kathitān' of the Matsyapurana or bhavisye pathitān' of Vāyu ( 99. 267 ) as referring to the Bhavişyapurāņa. In many passages of the Puranas we have references to 'bhavişyajña'(Brahmānda III. 74, 105), which simply means 'those who are conversant with sections on the future 'contained in ancient works like the Mahabharata. 

It is not possible owing to limitations of space to enter into detailed examination of the theories of several scholars about the date of the Mahābhārata war. But one or two important matters will have to be referred to here. 

Mr. Velandi Gopala Aiyer in 'The chronology of Ancient India in chap. II. (pp. 51-104 ) examines the astronomical data

furnished by the Mahābhārata and relying on the far-fetched and wrong interpretation put by him on the words of the Bṛhat samhita ( quoted above) and on the fact that the Kollam era in Malabar appears to take 1177 B.O. as the starting point for Kaliyuga arrives at the conclusion that the Mahābhārata war took place in the latter part of 1194 B. C. This theory goes against all the three other starting points which are supported by comparatively ancient and authoritative evidence. 

The information derived from the fragments of the work of Megasthenes on India are supposed to shed some light on this vexed problem. In one fragment (p. 115 of Ancient India as described by Megasthenes &c.') occurs the passage : 'From him (i. e. Bacchus ) to Alexander the Great 6451 years are reckoned with three months additional, the calculation being made by counting the kings that reigned in the inter mediate period to the number of 153'. An extract from Pliny makes out the number of kings to be 154. As against this we have the statement in the 'Indika' of Arrian (2nd century A. D., translated by McCrindle, p. 203): From the time of Dionysos to Sandrakottus, the Indians counted 153 kings and a period of 6042 years, but among these a republic was thrice established ...... another to 300 years and another to 120 years. The Indians also tell us that Dionysos was earlier than Heracles by fifteen generations and that except him no one made a hostile invasion of India. This passage is of very great im portance for one reason, viz. that it proves that in the 4th century B. C. there was a persistent Indian tradition which carried back Indian civilization and ordered government to 6000 years before the 4th century B. O. But there is great doubt as to what Megasthenes actually wrote and there is some divergence as to the number of years and kings also. Besides, this has no direct bearing on the date of the Mahābhārata war or the beginning of Kaliyuga, unless Heracles is taken to be Hari-Krşpa, as some scholars 1765 do. The account of Heracles (pp. 201-203 of McCrindle's work ) agrees in some respects with the legends about Krşpa viz. that he was honoured by the Sourasenoi ( Sürasenas), an Indian tribe who possegs two large 

1765. Vide Mr. C. V. Vaidya's 'Mabābhārata, a criticism' pp. 75–76, where ignoring the figures of total years (viz. 6042 or 6451) he comes to the conclusion that Krsna flourished about 3101 B, C. since 138 Kings between Heracles and Sandrakottus (i. e. Candragupta) may have ruled in all about 2760 years, taking 20 years as the average for each reign,902 

History of Dharmasastra 

[Vol. 

cities Methora (Mathura) and Cleisobora and that Heracles had many wives; but then there are other anecdotes about Heracles which do not at all agree viz. his having a daughter Pandaia with whom when she was only seven Heracles had intercourse for raising a mighty race, Here there is some confus ion with the Pandavas and Kunti or with the Pandyan kingdom in the South. Moreover, 6000 years for 153 or 154 kings is rather a very long period. It cannot be said that a king is only a unit of time in these computations ( 40 years on an average), since such Purāṇas as the Vāgu and the Matsya expressly mention the number of years that each dynasty held sway, the number of kings belonging to each dynastly and the lengths of the reigns of several kings. It is no doubt true that the details of the names of the several kings, the number of kings and the duration of their reigns do not always tally. It appears that the Purānas that contain historical material were recast at diffe rent times, e. g. the Vāyupurāņa ( 99. 383 ) refers to the Guptas while the Matsyapurāna is silent about them. The extant Puranas cannot be supposed to have given imaginary details about historical dynasties, but they must have had before them older records or traditions. The Purapas do not appear to have invented names of new kings or given imaginary lengths of reigns. The authors surely knew that the total of the several dynasties between Parikşit and Nanda did not square with the total of the lengths of the reigns of the several individual kings. But they gave both these without trying to solve the discrepancies as they wanted to record all the traditions they had got before them. The Purānas have a claim on our attention, but in the present state of our knowledge they cannot unfortunately form the basis of any certain or connected history and chronology of ancient times. 

A few words may here be said about the attempts made to deduce the age of the Mahābhārata war from the astronomical references in the Epic. 

The number of works and papers in which the dates of the Bharata war and of Kaliyuga are discussed is very large. A few of them only are noted here. The late Shankar Balkrishna Dikshit in his exhaustive volume on the History of Indian Astronomy' (in Marathi, 2nd ed. of 1931 ) deals with this subject at pp. 107 127. Mr. C.V. Vaidya in ‘Mahabharata, a criticism, 1904 'devotes one chapter (pp. 55–78) and appendix note V (pp. 180–190) to the date of the Mahabharata war. He holds fast to the traditional

view that the Mahabhārata war was fought in 3101 B, C, Mr. N. Jagannatha Rao writes a book on the Age of the Mahābhārata war' (Bezwada, 1931), in which he disputes the identity of Candragupta Maurya with Sandracottus mentioned by Megasthenes, holds that Sandracottus is the Gupta Emperor Candragupta, that the date of Candragupta Maurya would be about 1535 B. C., that the word 'Sakakāla ' in the Bphatsambitā refers really to the era of the Persian Emperor Cyrus about 550 B. C. and that the Great War was fought in 3139 B. C. The work does not go deeply into anything and is rather superficial. There is a lengthy and interesting article by Mr. K. G. Sankar on some problems of Indian Chronology' in Annals of the B.O.R. Institute, Poona, vol. XII pp. 301-361 in which he seems to favour 1198 B. O. as the date of the Mahābhārata war. Mr. J. S. Karandikar, editor of the 'Kesari' (Poona), contribut ed certain articles (in Marathi) which are now issued as a booklet (1939), in which he examines many of the astronomical references in the Mahābhārata and the Paurānic lists about the dynasties of ancient Indian kings and arrives at the conclu sion that the Mahābhārata war was fought in 1931 B. C. Though I differ from him in important details, I think that the date arrived at by him appears to be one of the two probable or best authenticated dates among the several dates proposed by various scholars. Prof. P. C. Sen-Gupta contributed a paper to the Journal of the Bengal Asiatic Society in 1937, vol. III pp. 101-119, in which he discusses the date of the Mahabharata war and arrives at the conclusion that the Bhārata war was fought about 2449 B. C. This also is a very probable date and has the authority of the tradition mentioned in the Bșhatsamhitā that the saka era is 2526 years after the era of Yuddhisthira. In J. A. S. B. for 1938, vol. IV pp. 393-413 Prof. Sen-Gupta again examines 

Bhārata battle traditions and confirms the date 2449 B. C. already arrived at by him. Dr. K. L. Daftari delivered some lectures in the University of Nagpur on the astronomical method and its application to the chronology of Ancient India' which are published in book form (Nagpur, 1942 ). This work exhaustively deals with almost all the passages of astronomical importance contained in the Mahābhārata and is characterized by great industry, patient calculations and ingenious explana tions of conflicting passages. His conclusion is that the Bharata war was fought in 1197 B. O. Although one feels nothing but admiration for the author's great learning and acumen, it is not possible to agree with the date arrived at by him or with 

904

[ Voli 

the method and theories adopted by him. Apart from details one cannot accede to the following theories propounded by him viz. his division of the astronomical references into two groups, his assumption that a passage in the Dronaparva (chap. 184) about the rising of the moon at about 2 A. M. is an interpolation ( because it does not square with his explanations of the other passages ), his bold expedient of changing * citrām' to caitām' in Bhişma 3. 1% and his transposition of Sravana and Puşya in Salyaparva 34. 6, his taking'angāraka' to mean Venus (and not Mars). Dr. Daftari's work was reviewed by Prof. Sen-Gupta in JASB for 1943, vol. IX pp. 221-228 and after submitting it to a searching analysis and calculations, the learned Professor arrives at the conclusion that he cannot accept Dr. Daftari's method, which is useless for all practical purposes. Prof. K. V. Abhyankar contributes an article to the Annals of B.O. R. I. for 1914, vol. XXV. pp. 116-136 on the date and time of the Bhārata war', in which he takes into account only the material available in the Epic itself and bases his conclusions 'on the principle of following the voice of the majority. He furnishes a useful table in an appendix that shows at a glance some of the important astronomical passages of the Mabābhārata with their interpretations given by the commentators Arjuna mišra and Nilakantha and by Mr. Karandikar and himself and finally gives his opinion that the traditional view of the date (3101 B. c. ) is approximately correct. It appears that he had not, when he wrote the article, the work of Dr. Daftari before him nor Prof, Sen-Gupta's devastating criticism of it. It will be apparent from the above that the attempts to settle the exact date of the Mahābhārata war on the strength of the astronomical materials contained therein are dismal failures. Hardly any two scholars agree on the exact dates so arrived at, which range from 1193 B. C. to 3101 B. C. and even beyond. There are many reasons for this disappointing result. In the first place, several of the criteria mentioned in the epic are hopelessly inconsistent, as will be made clear a little below by a few-examples. Further, several scholars assume that thefepio was composed within a short time (about three years arcording to Adiparva, 62,52,or.ed.chap. 56. 32 ) after the war. Many (including my humble self ) cannot subscribe to this view. Besides, we are totally in the dark about the details of the system of the calendar generally adopted at the period of the war. Many suppose that it largely resembled the rules contained in the Vedānga Jyotiga ( of the Rgveda ). There is no unanimity on the question whether the months.

onded with amāvāsyū (i. e. whether they were amanta) or wliether they ended with Full Moon (i. e. whether they were pūrnimānta ). 176 That a pūrnimānta month was in vogue in Vedic times is beyond dispute. For example, Tai. 8. states that Pürva Phaigunt is the last night of the year and Uttarā Phalgunl is the mouth (i. e. beginning). Similarly Tai. S. VII. 4. 8.2 declares that the citrāpürnamāsa is the mouth of the year; while San. Br. IV. 4 declares that the Phālguni Paurņa māsl is the mukha of the year. The author or authors of the Mahābhārata, in describing the evil portents of an impending tragic or catastrophic event, often assemble together (as in Udyoga 143.5-29, Bhişme 2. 16-33 ) all of them irrespective of the fact whether some of them are possible in the very order of nature. For example, it is stated that Arundhati wont before Vasiştha ( Bhişma 2. 31 ), that a mare gave birth to a cow calf and that a bitch gave birth to a jackal ( Bhişma 3. 6 ) and that images of gods trembled, laughed and vomited blood (Bhişma %. 26, which may be compared with Brhatsamhitā 45. 8 and the verses of Garga quoted by Utpala thereon); it is several times said that the Moon and the Sun are seized (i, e, eclipsed) at an unusual season (aparvani ) or simultaneously by Rāhu (vide 

1766. That the months in North-west Iğdia were pūrņimānta in the Kharostbi records drawn up in Kanişka's era is shown in E. I. vol. 18 p. 266 and E. I. vol. 19 at p. 10. Aparārka (p. 423 ) quotes a verse from TIOT **** orqat a ri faa fa and remarks that Bhādrapada dark half is in that verse said to be the dark half of Aśvina. In the Bhavisya purana (Uttara-parva, chap. 132. 17) the Full Moon of Phālguna is said to be the end of the month' (foto Fregatura coafat gra I Fiat 

vai ra TTÀ gigt). In the Matsyapurāna ( 159. 4-6) it is said that Skanda and Visakha were born on the 15th of the dark half of Caitra, that to the bright half of Caitra itself on the 5th Iadra made one boy out of the two and on the 6th crowned him as Lord. This shows that in the Matsya Caitra was fürgimanta and not amānta. When the month is pūrnimānta, the first fortnigbt ending with amāvāsyā is assigned to a month which is one month in advance of the amanta reckoning i. e. what is Kārtika dark hall with amanta reckoning becomes Mārgasīrsa dark half with the pārgi. mānta reckoning. On Jai. VI. 5. 31 Sabara quotes a Vedic passage about गवामयन 'पुरस्तारपोर्णमास्याश्चतुरहे दीक्षेरन् । तमुख वैषा पौर्णमासी संवत्सरस्य या चैत्री ahoraret', which seems to indicate that the year began with the Full Moon of Caitra and that the pūrnimānta reckoning was not unknown,

(Vol. 

Bhişmaparva 3.28 and 32-33 and Āśvamedhikaparva 77.15 ). 1767 Further, these very verses state that the eclipses of the Sun and the Moon took place on the same day and on the 13th and in the same month. Dr. Daftari interprets 'ekāhnā 'as mean ing on the same week-day and' on the 13th tithi' (pp. 5-6 of his work ) caloulated according to the wrong method of those days. It is extremely doubtful whether week-days had been known or named at the time of the Bhārata war or even at the time of the composition of the Epic. It is too much to assuine that the astronomers of the Mahabharata war days, while they could predict eclipses and state accurately the position of the planets, were so clumsy as to allow a mistake of two tithis to occur in their calendar with respect to the occurrence of a solar eclipse. The words in Bhişmaparva 3. 28 and 32-33 appear to be a mere exaggerated statement of portents. If real observed eclipses are meant they would have to be taken in the order of the words in the text, viz. first an eclipse of the Moon (on Kārtika paurpima ) and then an eclipse of the Sun ( on Kārtika amāvāsya ) and further it must be assumed that the dark half of Kartika contained only 13 days. Dr. Daftari (pp. 44-46 of his work ) holds that first there was a solar eclipse on Aśvina amāvāsyā, then a lunar eclipse and then again a solar eclipse. In that case we should expect the order to be 'sürya-candrau' and not 'candragūryau'. Besides, hardly any other scholar holds that there were three eclipses one after another. There fore, it is hardly possible to say with certainty that the author accurately states astronomical facts observed by him or even traditionally handed down as definite facts and does not draw on his own imagination about the portents or does not exaggerate 

1767. चमवावुभौ यसो एकाला हि योदशीम्। अपर्वणि ग्रह यातौ प्रजासंक्षय मिच्छतः ॥ चन्मपर्यावुभौ मस्सो एकमासी प्रयोदशीम् । अपर्वणि ग्रहेणैतौ प्रजाः संक्षप furua: a POATE 328, 32. The cr. edition of the Mahābhārata gives oply the first of these two verses. Utpala in his com. on Bphatsambitā 5. 26 reads एकमासे त्रयोदशे. The words प्रजाः संक्षपयिन्यतः make it quite clear that eclipses and the fortnight of thirteen tithis are taken as very evil omens. Similar words occur in Bhiama 3, 12 and 13 quoted below in note 1779. In: Bșhatsamhita 3, 6 it is said that a graha called Tvaştr makes the orb of the Sun look dark even when there is ao parva (amāvāsyā). Utpala quotes on the same a verse of Parisara surat per MT MET * FRETE: I guta TAIFA: Forum H. There is no doubt whatever that the writer of Bhisma 2 and 3 is more concerned with chronicling evil omeas than with setting out accurate astronomical and other data observed by him personally or ovon by others.

as a rhetorical device. In Bțhatsaṁhita 5. 26, 97-98 Varaha mihira states the evil consequences if a moon eclipse precedes or follows a sun eclipse in the period of one fortnight. 

Most of the important astronomical details will now be set out from the time when Lord Krsna is said to have started as a peace-maker to the Kauravas. In Udyogaparva 83, 6-71768 it is said that Krsna started in the month of Kārtika (Kaumude māsi) at the end of the farad season and about the advent of winter, when the moon was in Revati nakşatra and on maitra muhurta. Asyina and Kārtika are at present said to form the season of sarad, and Mārgasirşa and Pausa form hemanta. This verse itself presents a difficulty. On the Full Moon day of Kārtika, the moon is in Krttikā nakşatra and the moon would be in Revati three days before i. e. on or about the 12th of the bright half of Kārtika. If we take this along with the words ‘at the end of sarad' it follows that the month was pūrnimānta ; otherwise (i. e. if the month were amūnta) it would be highly improper to say that the 12th of the bright half of Kārtika was at the end of Sarad. After Krsna failed in his mission he returned to the Pāņdavas ( for all of which we must allow a few days after the 12th of Kārtika sukla) and reported what Duryodhana and he himself said. Two of the statements reported by him are very material. Duryodhana said to his allies': March towards Kuruksetra (for battle); to-day the moon is (in) Pusya nakşatra '. 1769 If Krsna started on his mission when the moon was in Revati ( on the 12th of the bright half of Kārtika ), then these above words must have been uttered in his presence on or about the 5th of the dark half of Kartika ( or of Mārga. śirşa if the month was pūrpimānta ). Another important state. ment is that Krspa in his conversation with Karna ( whom he had tried to win over ) stated to him: 'this is a mild month in 

1768. मैत्रे मुर्ते संपाने साधषि विधाकरे। कौमुदे मासि रेवत्या शरदन्ते हिमागमे । gotto 83. 6–7, 15 mubūrtas of the day and 15 of the night are referred to even in the po or X, 4. 2. 18, 25, 27 and the trattaro (III. 10. 1.1) mentione the names of the 15 mubūrtas of the day (such as Citra, Ketu &c.). In the Kumārasambhava VII. 6 the maitra mubūrta is mentioned in connection with ceremonies preceding marriage. The commentators explain maitra as the 3rd mubūrta after sunrise. In the Atharva Jyotisa fifteen muhūrtas of the day are enumerated of wbich the first three are Raudra, Sveta and Maltra.

which fodder and fuel oan be easily had, which is neither too hot nor too cold; on the 7th day (from today ) there will be amāvāsyā; battle may be joined on that day; they regard it as having Indra for its ( guardian )1770 deity'. Therefore this must have been said on or about the 8th of the dark half of the month. But what was the name of the month? If the reckon ing was pārņimānta, the month must be Mārgasirşa, but if the reckoning was amānta, the month must be Kārtika. The words 'this month' taken along with Udyoga 83, 6–7 would indicate that the month meant was Kārtika. Further, Indra was the deity of Jyesthā naksatra and the amavasya ( as stated in Udyoga 142. 16-18) had Jyesthā nakşatra. In modern times this is possible on Kārtika Amāvāsya, while there cannot be Jyesthā naksatra in modern times on Mārgasirsa amāvāşya, but only on or about the 13th of the dark half of it. But this passage itself (Udyoga 142. 16-18) is in conflict with Salya 35. 10 where Krspa says: 'the Kauravas do not act up to my words, being driven to do so by the Time Spirit; 01 descendants of Pāṇdu, go out (for battle ) together with me when the moon is in Pusya'. If the moon was in Jyestha on amāvāsya when Krsna had proposed to Karna that the war should be begun, this passage of Salyaparva would put the beginning of the war 16 or 17 days after Kārtika amāvāsyā, which is not war ranted by any other passage and which no scholar puts forward. In Udyoga 143. 11 it is stated, 1771 "the spot on the moon has turned away ( disappeared) and Rahu approaches the Sun.' The exact meaning of the first quarter is not quite clear. Some interpret it to mean that 'an eclipse of the Moon has already taken place'. The moon looks beautiful with the spot thereon (compāre Sakuntala I ' malinamapi himõisor lakṣma lakṣmim tanoti). The disappearance of the spot might have been looked upon as an evil portent. Even supposing that the first quarter refers to an eclipse of the moon, it does not matter much. The second quarter states that an eclipse of the Sun was expected when Karņa addressed these words to Krspa, the envoy of the

Papdavas. Later on in Bhisma 2.23 it is stated 1772 that the Moon had become devoid of brightness, was without its spot on the Full moon day of Kārtika and assumed the colour of fire while the sky retained its original hue; so that if there was an eclipse of the moon it was on Kārlika Paurnimā and an eclipse of the sun was yet to take place. On the whole, therefore, one may assume, though not without hesitation, that the months were amanta, that possibly there was an eclipse of the moon on Kārtika Full Moon when Krsna had gone as a peace-maker and that there was a solar eclipse on the amāvāsya of Kartika just about the time the war began, In Salyaparva 56. 10 we again meet with the words ( at the beginning of the mace duel) 'Rahu swallowed the Sun at an unusual season'. This passage and Ašvamedhika 77. 15 ( Rabur-agrasadadityam yugapat soma meva ca) rather suggest that the eclipse of the sun at an unusual time had become a stock example of an evil portent without the actual occurrence thereof. The words in Salyaparva refer to the last day of the war before the mace duel between Duryodhana and Bhima and the passage says that Rahu seized the sun and there was an earth-quake also. Hardly any one (except Dr. Daftari) holds that there was another eclipse on the last day of the war, when just before the war there already had been an eclipse on Kartika amāvāsyā. 

As to the exact tithi and naksatra on which the Great War began, there are many conflicting statements. In the Bhārata dāvitri it is stated that the Bhārata war started in the first month (i. e. Mārgasirşa ) of Hemanta on the 13th of the bright half when the moon was in the nakşatra presided over by Yama (1. e. Bharani ) 1773. The Bhārata-sāvitri is no part of the

The following verses of the perfitoft are material for the days of the important events of the war: 'ART QUA RIĦ UPT Tirasit मासं भारतं युदं नक्षत्रं यमदेवतम् ॥ फाल्गुन्यो निहतो भीष्मः ष्णपक्षे च ससमी । अष्ठम्यो चेष सौभद्रो नाम्पा व जयद्रथः । दशम्यो भगवत महायुद्धे निपातितः । एकादश्यामर्धरात्री हतो पीरो घटोत्कचः। ततः प्रभातसमये विरादनुपदो हतो। बादश्यां चैव मध्याहे वोणाचार्यो रणे इतःप्रयोदश्या तु मध्यावषसेनो निपातितः पितुर्दश्यां तु पूर्ण रणे दु:शासनोहतः । ...

Mahabhārata, yet it has some traditional value, being probably earlier than all the commentators of the Mahabharata and later than the text of Sauti. In conflict with this passage of the Bhāratasāvitrī we have the words of Udyoga 142. 18 ( quoted above ) where Krşņa says to Karpa that battle may be joined on amā vāsyā when the moon is in Jyesthā. The Mahābhārata itself states that after the disposition of the vast armies were made and commanders were appointed, Duryodhana called Ulūka and sent him to the Pandavas to inflame their feelings with the words 1774 (Udyoga 160. 93 ) 'the worship of steel ( weapons ) has been performed, the site of Kurukşetra is dried up (has no mud), your horses are well fed, warriors are hired by you; fight tomorrow. This Lohābhihāra (orgāra ) is the game as the rite of nirājanā ( according to the Amarakośa ) or is performed immediately after nirājanā (for which see pp. 230-231 above). Kautilya (IL. 30 p. 135) prescribes a nīrājanā rite at the start of an invasion and when two seasons meet. So a nfrājanā rite on Kārtika amāvāsya would be most appropriate (both because a battle was to be begun and because at the end of Kārtika the season of Sarad ended). The Bṛhatsamhita ( 43. 1-2) prescribes a nfrājana rite for horses, elephants and men on the 8th or 12th of Kārtika bright half or on the 15th of Kartika (Full Moon or amāvāsyā).

whether Mr. Karandikar is right in saying that Lohābhihara (or-sāra ) refers to Skandaşaşth1. In the first place, the worship of weapons can be done at any time,' particularly when a battle is to be commenced. In the second place, it is not necessary to postulate the lapse of six days and more for the sending of Ulūka and his return from the time when Krspa said that battle may be begun on amāvāsyā. The armies had taken up opposite positions on the field of Kurukşetra and Ulūka could have come and gone in a day or two. Further, we have no evidence that Skanda-sasthi was performed in northern India in Mārgasirşa, though very late works composed by dākşinātyas like the Nirnayasindhu say that Skandaşasthi is the same as Campaşasthi in Maharastra and is observed on the 6th of Mārgasirsa. Raghunandana quoting Devipurāņa places Skandasasthi on Caitra 6th of the bright half and is supported by the Matsyapurāņa quoted above in n.1766. There is no reason why the actual fight should commence so late as the 13th day of Mārgasirşa (or even 11th as Mr. Karandikar suggests ) when Krsna said that it should be joined on amāvāsyā. It is quite possible that the war began on or about Kartika amāvāsyā. The observance of. 'lohābhihāra' does not lead to the certain inference that the war was not begun till several days after the 6th of the bright half of Mārgasirşa. Similarly, Mr. Karandi kar says that the moon is ordinarily in Bharani on the 11th or 12th of the bright half of Mārgaśirşa. It may be so. But it is possible to have the moon in Bharaṇl even on the 13th. I am inclined to hold that the Bhāratasāvitri dates of the beginning of the war embody a different tradition altogether from the one contained in the Mahābhārata itself. The Bhāratasāvitri is silent about nakşatras on which the principal events of the war took place except at the commencement of the war. It mentions no tithikşaya or tithivŢddhi. Krsna sends a message with Ulūka to Duryodhana (Udyoga 162, 57 ) 'tomorrow you will be seen' (in your true colours) and Arjuna does the same (Udyoga 163. 14 ). 

The Mahābhārata nowhere states quite explicitly the tithi or nakşatra on which the battle actually commenced. We have to rely upon various indications to arrive at the tithi or nakşatra, Balarama could not bear to see the fight between Duryodhana and Bhima, both of whom were his pupils in mace-duel and went on a pilgrimage (Udyoga 157. 33-35 and 158,39). Balarama returned on the 18th day of the war and (in Salyapa rva 34. 6).912

he remarks, 'it is 42 days since I left (on a pilgrimage); I start ed when the moon was in Puşya and I have come here again on Sravana '1775, In Salya 35. 13-14 it is stated that Balarama went to the river Sarasvati on pilgrimage on 'maitra-naksatra yoga' (i. e. when the moon was in Anuradha ). This conflict may be resolved by holding, as Nilakantha does, that Balarama left the Pandavas on Pusya, reached the Sarasvati on Anuradha and returned on Sravana. If we follow Salya 34.6 the war commenced when the moon was in or near Mrgasirşa (18 nakşatras before Sravana ). This would be in direct conflict with a passage in Bhismaparva 17.2 that 1776 on the day of battle the moon was in the province of Magha' and also other passages that will be indicated later on. This last passage should ordinarily mean that the moon was near Magha, Mr Karandikar looks upon Salya 34.6 as an interpolation and takes Bhisma 17.2 to mean that the moon was in an inauspici. ous naksatra of the category of Magha. This would suit Bharani but not Rohiņi or Mrgaśirşa. His meaning is far fetched and he does not explain why Bharani was not directly mentioned in the Epic, when in several other places the epic doos mention directly the naksatra concerned. His explanation gives the go-by to the 13th tithi. Dr. Daftari boldly asserts that we must transpose the nakşatras ( in Salya 34. 6 ) and read *śravape samprayatosmi puşyeņa punarāgataḥ'. If we once resort to these methods followed by these two learned writers, there is no knowing where one should stop. There are scholars who might with equal or greater plausibility claim that most of these astronomical references are either of very late date or are inter polations ( vide Vaidya's Mahābhārata' p. 71). Similarly, if we once concede that we are at liberty to change readings to suit our theories even in the total absence of all manuscript evidence, then there is no sure foundation on which we can build. The Mahabharata passages have a tradition of centuries behind them. We must, in the absence of good mss. evidence to the contrary, either accept them all and try to explain them or we must give up the job of reconciling them as a hopeless tangle and rely on other evidence to arrive at the date of the

Bhārata war as best as we can. We saw above that Jyestha was the nakşatra on Kārtika amāvāsyā and, if the war began then, the nakşatra on the 18th day from then would be Pusya. Nilakantha, following the Mimāṁsā rules of interpretation, holds that the concluding passage (upasamhāravākya) is superior in strength to passages that occur at the beginning of a work, that the passage in Salya 34. 6 is the dominant one and other conflicting passages must be either brushed aside or explained away in conformity with Salya 34.6 and gives an explanation of Maghāyişayagaḥ somah' which is quite unsatisfactory, Dr. Daftari also holds, relying on Atharva Jyotişa, that the passage means the moon was in Müla' (p. 27 para. 62-65 of his work 'Astronomical method' &c.). The explanation is ingenious but one fails to see why this round-about way was resorted to and why the text did not simply say 'mūlanaksatragaḥ somaḥ', which violates no metrical requirements. In Anušāsana parva ( 167.26-28 ) Bhişma, while on the bed of darts, states : 1777 * the sun has turned ( towards the north); 58 days have passed by since I laid myself down on this (arrow bed). This is the mild month of Māgha that is now current, three parts of it remain and this fortnight should be sukla'. Bhişma was struck down on the 10th day of the war; so 67 nights had passed from the day when the war began to the day in Māgha on which this was uttered. The difficulty is how to connect 'tribhāgašeşah', whether as an adjective of' māsa' or of 'pakşa'. If we take it in the first way, these words were uttered on 8th of Magha śukla : if we take it as an adjective of pakşa', then they will have to be taken as uttered on the 4th of the bright half or on the 4th of the dark half which may be regarded in its astrologi cal effects as equal to śuklapakşa ( though the tithi itself is in the dark half). If the words were uttered on the 8th of Magha śukla, the Bhārata war began on Kartika amāvāsyā (which will be in consonance with Udyoga 142. 18 quoted in n. 1770 ). The passage in Anušāgana (167. 26-28) is supported by two other passages. After the war was over, Yudhisthira went to the capital and stayed there for 50 nights and when he found that the Sun had started on its apparent northward path (uttarāyana) he came to Bhişma ( Anušāsana 167,5). In Santiparva 51. 14 Krsna says to Bhişma: 'You have yet to live 56 days.' Nila kantha, who takes Salya 34. 6 as the dominant passage, puts a

most far-fetched construction on the word "astapañcāsatam', which he takes to mean'one hundred minus 58' i. e. 42 nights and explains 'pañcāśatam şat ca as equal to 30. This shows to what straits commentators are reduced when conflicting passages bave got to be explained away. One more indication about the tithi on which the war commenced is afforded by Dronaparva chap. 184, where it is stated that a gtim fight went on till midnight when Ghatotkaca was killed, that the fatigued armies then snatched some sleep, that then the moon rose at about 2 A. M. (verge 46 ) and that the fight was then regumed 1718 ( chap 186. 1 tribhagamātrasesāyām rāiryan yuddham-apartata ). This description of moonrise shows that Ghatotkaca was killed on or about the 11th of the dark half. We know from the Mahābhārata itself that Ghatotkaca was kill ed on the night of the 4th day of Drona's command or on the 14th day after the war began. This would establish that the war began on the 12th or 13th of the bright half and ended on the 14th of the dark balf or on amāvāsya of Mārgasirşa. Dr. Daftari holds that this description is an interpolation. 

If we try to find out the nakşatra on which the war began, we have one sure criterion in Salya 34. 6 viz. that the war ended on Sravana naksatra when Balarāma returned from pilgrimage. Now the moon cannot be in Sravaņa at all in Mārgasirsa dark half, but may be in it on the first or 2nd of the bright half of Pausa. So between the tithi and naksatra as disclosed by the Mahābhārata itself there is a slight dis crepanoy of a day or two. There is another way of looking at the data. Bhışma was waiting for uttarāyana to begin and we know that he passed away on the 59th day after he was mortally wounded on the 10th day of the war. Therefore, a period of 67 days ( 58 nights of his lying on arrow-bed plus 9 nights of the battle when he slept on his usual bed ) elapsed between the beginning of the war and the beginning of Uttarayana, which undoubtedly occurred in Magha in that year(as Anuśāsana 167. 28 expressly states). The real difficulty is to find out the tithi of the commencement of Uttarāyaṇa. But if we accept the approximate tithi and naksatra ( as stated above ) of the end of

the war (i.e. Mārgaširşa amāvāsyā or 1st of Pauşa and Sravana nakşatra ), uttarāyaṇa began 49 days thereafter i. e. on or about the 4th of the dark half of Māgha. According to the Vedānga jyotisa, 4th of the dark half of Māgha is one of the tithis on which uttarayana may begin ( vide Dikehit's work pp. 75, 91 ). How scholars accept one of the data and reject others is well illustrated here. Acc. to Salya 34. 6 the war ended on Sravana (and so should have begun when the moon was in Mrgaśirşa ). Acc. to the Bhāratasāyitri the war began on Bharani and on the 13th of the bright half of Mārgaśīrşa and ended on Amā Vābyā (and therefore the nakşatra was Müla or Pārvāşadha ). Arjunamiśra gives up the nakşatras and sticks to the tithis. Mr. Karandikar gives up the express verse about Sravana (and regards that whole chapter as an interpolation), he gives up the 13th tithi of the beginning of the war as given in the Bhārata sāvitri, holds that the war began on 11th instead and sticks fast to the Bharani naksatra given in the Bhāratasavitrī. Dr. Daftari altogether changes the reading of Salya 34, 6 by transposing the naksatras mentioned. 

The difference between the day of Uttarāyaṇa in Māgha stated in the Mahābhārata and the day thereof at present is utilised by scholars for arriving at the date of the Maha bhārata war. 

There are other data in the Mahābhārata from which also the date of the Mahābhārata war is sought to be deduced. Before entering into details, some matters that are accepted by most scholars may be stated here. It is generally held that there were two eclipses, first, one of the moon immediately followed by a solar eclipse, that there was a fortnight of 13 days which was looked upon as very unusual and a very evil omen. Vide Bhisma 3. 28 quoted in n. 1767. In Bhişmaparva 3. 31-32 Vyāsa is reported as saying, 'I have known amāvāsyā occurring on the 14th, 15th or 16th day (of a pakşa ), but I do not know an amāyāsyā occurring on the 13th day (of a paksa); both the moon and the sun were eclipsed in the same month on the 13th day'. In the Mausala-parva 1779 2. 18-19, when Krsna, 36 years after the war, beheld certain portents it is said, "on observing those portents on the amāvesyā occurring on the 13th day he declared' Rahu had made this ( 13th day ) appear as the 14th and 15th (when usually there is amavasya ) when the Bharata

war took place; to-day it has again occurred for our destruction'. From these words it is clear that the ocourrence of am āvāsya at the end of a pakşa of 13 days was looked upon as a very evil omen. Then many scholars hold that a comet had also appeared at the time of the great war. Bhişma 3. 131780 states, ' a very frightful comet stands in the sky covering the constellation of Pusya'. There are grave doubts whether the statement is made from actual observation. The appearance of a comet has always been associated in ancient times with great calamities. Compare Kumārasambhava II. 32' upaplavāya lokānām dhūmaketurivot thitaḥ'. As indicated above, the Mahābhārata gathers together several possible and impossible things to emphasize their significance as to impending calamities. Therefore the inclu sion of a comet among portents does not establish that a comet had actually appeared at the time of the Bhārata war. Supposing for argument that a comet had appeared, that circumstance is of no help at all in settling the date. A large number of comets is included in the sun's retinue. The number of comets of long periods that approach the sun in a century is said to be 300. There is nothing to show what particular comet appeared at the time of the war and no one has data to connect the Mahābhārata comet with Halley's comet or any other comet well-known in modern times. Therefore the datum about a comet is entirely worthless for purposes of chronology. According to Břhatsamhita 11, 5 and Utpala thereon the ancient writer Parāśara held the view that there were 101 ketus and Garga said that there were a thousand. The description in Bhisma 3. 13 states that the perihelion of the comet was in Pusya. In Udyogaparya 143. 10 it is said ' since a graha specially afflicts Citrā, a great calamity is indeed approaching the Kauravas'. This may probably refer to a comet. Two other verses appear to have some bearing on this. Bhisma 3. 12 states 1781 that the white graha stands traversing

citra ( i. e. it is about to enter into svāti) and verse 16 says, the white graha is fiery like fire emitting smoke and stands occupy ing Jyesthā which is a bright star presided over by Indra'. What is meant by 'white graha'? The words. sveto grahaḥ should ordinarily denote Venus. Nilakantha takes them to mean Ketu (node) in Bhisma 3. 12 and another comet in 3. 16. If this latter explanation be accepted there were two comets seen at the time. Even if we hold that Bhisma 3. 16 describes the tail of the comet mentioned in 3. 13, that is of very little help. All that would be meant would be that the tail of the comet was a very long one. Bhisma 3. 17 has been taken to refer to Rāhu by Nilakantha, while some modern scholars hold that it refers to a comet. It means, ' a cruel comet standing between Citrā and Svāti, afflicts Rohini and also the sun and the moon'. The description of the Ketu valled Sveta in Brhat samhitā 11. 39 agrees very closely with the description in the Bhismaparva and Parāśara quoted by Utpala thereon states that thie Ketu called 'Sveta' becomes visible after 115 years and portends the destruction of two-thirds of the population. 

Then there are several passages which state the positions of several planets just before the battle or on the day the battle began. Here again at least two different positions are assigned to each planet except Mercury. It is first to be noted that at the beginning of the war all the seven planets excluding Rabu and Ketu are declared to have been near each other ( Bhişma 17, 2, 9. in note 1776 above). We know from the Mahābhārata itself that the Sun and the Moon on Kārtika amāvāsyā were in Jyesthā. If the war began on amāvāsyā or a day later, the planets must be near Jyesthā. If the Bhāratasāvitri be follow ed then the war began on Mārgaśirsa bright 13 and on Bharani. If that were so, the sun and the moon cannot be together. Mr. Karandikar takes 11th of the bright half of Mārgaśırsa to be the tithi of the beginning of the war and holds that the Sun was in nakşatra Jyesthā and that the moon was in Bharani (following the Bhāratasāvitri as to this last). I should hold that we are not at liberty to take one datum from one group of statements and another from another group and then say that it is proved that the war was fought at a particular time. It is further noted in Karpaparva 37. 4 that on Karşa's death ( i.e. 17 days after the war began), the seven planets were seen going away from the Sun, 1782 The positions of the planets at the beginning of the war were as follows

not near the Sun but far away. Bhisma 3. 18 declares : 'Mars, having changed 

its motion after being retrograde and with the lustre of fire, stands covering Sravaņa, the mansion of Bșhaspati' 1704

We find that the Mahābhārate employs two classes of expres siong. When it uses words like' tişthati' (stands ), 'akramya' (having traversed ),' samvștya or samparivārya'(having cover ed or concealed ) it means that the planet was in or very near that naksatra. When words meaning "afflicts (pīdayati) are employed, the meaning is probably that the planet has only drsti on the nakşatra. It is impossible to say whether the rules and theories about dřsti or purņa drsţi and partial dřsti had been evolved at the time of the Mahābhārata War. If the war was fought about 3101 B, C. or even 1931 B, C. there is nothing to establish that the theories about drsti contained even in the Atharvajyotisa ( which is certainly later than the Vedānga jyotiga of the Rgveda i. e. much later than about 1200 B. C.) were known then. Vide under Venus for further difficulties. JUPITER- Bhisma 3. 14 states that Jupiter was retrograde 

in Sravana ; Bhişma 3. 27 states, 1785 Both Jupiter and Saturn that had stayed together 

for a year are near Visakhā and are both fiery'. Jupiter cannot stay for one year in one nakşatra; 

it traverses 27 naksatras in a year. If at the time of the war Jupiter was near Visakhā it could not have been near it for a year. Eleven months before that it would have been very 

near Citrā. If it was near Višākha at the time of the war and the Sun was in Jyestha, it can hardly be correct to say that seven planets had come together in the sky (there being' a dis tance of about two naksatras or about 26

degrees between the two). Even if we hold the meaning to be that Jupiter and Saturn had remained near Višākha for one year and are (now at the time of the war) fiery, that does not solve the difficulty. In the first place, it is not a natural construction. This meaning would leave the exact position of the two planets at the time of the war unspecified. But Jupiter and Saturn must be supposed to be in or near Jyesthā if the Sun was in Jyesthā at the beginning of the war. If Saturn was in Jyestha at the time of the war it could have been one year in Viśākhā about two years before the war. What is the propriety of men tioning Saturn's position two years before the war? The relevant point is to state that posi tion at the time of the war. Therefore it must be held that Bhisma 3. 27 states their position at the time of the war and adds one more circumstance that they were there for one year. 

Karnaparva 94, 51 says: "Brhaspati 'having 

entirely covered Rohipi has become like the Sun and the Moon'. If at the beginning of the war Bṛhaspati was retrograde and was near Visakhā, it passes one's understanding how in a fortnight it came to Rohini. Mr. Karandikar suggests that Rohini here is the name of Jyestha as in the Tai. S. IV. 4. 10. 1-3. Again in this explanation there are several difficulties. There is nothing to show that at the time of the Bhārata war or of the epic Jyesthā was called Rohiņi. The Tai. S. does not employ the name Jyesthā in its list. It speaks of Rohipi once as having Prajāpati for its presiding deity and then as having Indra as the presiding deity. Jyeşthā is well-known to the Mahabhārata and the word is employed by it in other passages. Further, if Bphaspati had covered Jyeşthā it can hardly be correct or even useful (for the purposes of chronology) to say that Jupiter was near Visakha.

VENUS 

Bhisma 3. 15 states that Venus 1786 having ascend 

ed (i. e. occupied ) the Purvābhādrapada paksatra shines charmingly and it looks up to Uttarābhadrapadā together with (?). The meaning of' parikramya sahitaḥ' is not at all clear. However the first half is as clear as possible. Venus was in Pūrvā Prosthapadā. If the Sun was in Jyesthā on Kārtika amāvāsya. it is impossible that Venus could have been in the 8th naksatra from Jyeşthā. Venus is never more than four nakşatras from the Sun in the sky. This would completely knock on the head the principal statement that seven planets were near each other. Mr. Karandikar in desperation suggests that we should under stand Pārvāsādhā for "Prosthapade Pārve' and also that the word 'Prosthapade' was an interpolation inserted by some busy body later on. As I have frequently said above, this is a most unjustifiable way of dealing with the so called astronomical data in the Mahābhārata. "Prosthapade Pārve' can never mean ‘Pūrvā sādha'. In the Tai, S. IV, 4. 10. 1-3, and the Tai, Br. I. 5. 1 and III. 1. 1 the word Prostha padā is expressly employed for Pürva Bhadra pada. Why should one word in a verse be held to be interpolated ? Is it because it does not agree with one's hypothesis? In Salya 11. 18 Venus and Mars are said to be in conjunc tion with the Moon. If the war started on Bharani as the Bhāratasāvitri says, then at the time of the mace-duel the moon might be in Jyesthi and therefore both Mars and Venus will have to be in Jyesthā. But this is oppos ed to two of the passages cited above referring to the position of Mars. If the war began on Jyestha and Kārtika amāvāsyā, then on the 18th day the moon will be in Pusya or Aslesa and both Venus and Mars would have to be in one of these two. In any case, if Venus was

war, on the 18th day it can neither be in Jyestha, nor in Puşya nor in Aśleşā. Besides, it is debatable whether Bhisma 3. 16 ( where sveto grahaḥ' is mentioned ) refers to Venus or not. Venus is often called 'Sita' in ancient astronomical works (e. g. in Bphat. 

samhita 9. 42, 45 ). We have four statements about Saturn. In 

Udyoga 143. 8 we read, 1787 'A refulgent and malignant planet, Saturn, afflicts the naksatra presided over by Prajapati (i. e. Rohini)'; Bhisma 2.32 states, 'Saturn afflicts Rohiņi'; Bhişma 3. 14 says, 'the naksatra presided over by Bhaga is covered and afflicted by Saturn'; Jupiter and Saturn are near Visakha (Bhişma 3,27 considered above). In the first three passages the root 'pid' occurs and therefore it is possible to argue that some kind of aspect ( drsti or vedha ) of the nakgatra mentioned in the text is meant. But in the third passage both 'akramya' and 'pidyati' are used about the same nakşatra. This makes that passage inexplicable in the usual way. The 'prājāpatya naksatra'must be Rohiņi as in the 2nd passage Robiņi is expressly named. All authorities agree that Prajāpati is the deity of Rohiņi. 'Prājāpatya naksatra' cannot be taken to mean Müla, since the presiding deity of Mūla ispitaraḥ' in Tai. 8. IV. 4. 10. 1-3 and Nirfti ( in the Tai. Br. I. 5. 1 and in the Vedānga-jyotişa ) and Prajāpati only in some later works. Bhaga is the presiding deity of Uttarā Phalguni in the Tai. S. IV. 4. 10. 1-3 and Tai. Br. I. 5. 1, and IIL 1. 1, while in the Vedāngajyotisa (Rgveda, Verse 25 ), Visņu Dh. S. (78. 16), San. Gr. (I. 26. 9, SBE vol. 29 p. 53 ) Bhaga is the deity of Purvā Phalguni. The 4th passage about Saturn being near Visakha has been already dealt with under Jupiter.

The above detailed statement about the astronomical passages of the Mahabhārata will induce any unbiassed reader who has no axe to grind that they are hopelessly inconsistent and that no certain chronological conclusion can be drawn therefrom. In the above discussion I have generally not cited the various explanations indulged in by several scholars, as that would have involved me in a very lengthy discourse without any adequate benefit. To me it appears probable that the final redactor of the Mahābhārata had two or more sets of astronomical data about the war before him and without trying to examine and sift them he included them all in his work. The Bharata savitri probably represents one (and a later) tradition about the positions of the planets at the time of the war. As I hold that either the Mahābhārata passages on the positions of the planets were interpolated at a very late stage or are hope lessly inconsistent I deem it unnecessary to enter upon an examination of the mathematical calculations made by several scholars to find out the date of the Bhārata war from the shift ing of the solstices and the position of the planets. 

Since only 5046 years have elapsed (in 1945 A. D.) from the beginning of the Kali age and as Kaliyuga extends to 432000 years according to Paurānic computations we are just on the threshold of the Kaliyuga and it is beyond one's com prehension to visualize what will happen towards the end of the vast period of about 427000 years that are still to pass before Kaliyuga ends. It is very small consolation to read in the Purānas in a prophetic strain that at the end of that colossal period Visnu will be incarnated as Kalkin in a village Sam. bhala, will destroy all Mlechbas, šūdra kings and heretics and will establish dharma, so that the Krta age will then be ushered in. Here again as in almost all matters there are differences in the legend. The Vāyu ( 58. 75-90 ) and the Matsya (144, 50-64 ) state that it will be Pramati Bhargava who will be the avatāra of Vişnu and uproot the Mlechhas, heretics and sūdra 

· kings, while Vayu 98. 104-110 and 99. 396-7, Vanaparva 190. 93-97, Bhāgavata XII. %. 16-23 state that Kalkin will conquer the Mleochas, will become a universal emperor ( cakravartin ) of the dharmavijayin type and will start the Krta age. In some passages he is oalled Kalki (nom. of Kalkin ) as in Vanaparva 190.93, Brahma 213. 164, Vāyu 99.396, Matsya 47, 248, Nřsimha 54. 3; while in others as Kalkih (nom. of Kalki) as in Vayu 98. 104, Kalki 2. 28, Bhagavata XIL 2. 16, Matsya 47, 251.

17882. Various efforts have been made about finding germs of history in the legend of Kalkin. In I. A. vol. 48 pp. 123-128 Prof. H. B. Bhide tries to show how Jain authorities about Kalkin are conflicting. Mr. K. P. Jayaswal in I. A. vol. 46 (for 1917) p. 145 holds tbat Kalkla must be identified with the great hero Yasodharman who ruled over India from the Brahmaputrā to the Western Ocean and from the Himālaya to Mahendra and who conquered the Hun Mibirakula and made him pay homage to his feet as stated in the Mandasor Inscription (vide Gupta Ias. p. 149). Prof. Pathak on the other hand relying upon certain Jaina sources identifies Kalkin with Mibirakula himself (I. A. for 1918 at p. 19). Otto Schrader in Brahmavidyā vol. I. pp. 17-27 discusses how the names Kalkin or Kalki came to be given to the saviour of India from Mlecchas, heretics and the like. Kalka means 'sin' or 'sediment' and Karka means 'a white horse'. Therefore he thinks that Kalkin is a form of karkin (one riding a white borse). Vide also N. I. A, vol. IV, pp. 337–343 (on Kalki from the Kalki. purāņa). It is probable that the dismal accounts of Kaliyuga were put forth in the first centuries of the Christian era when the ancient varna śrama-dharma had suffered a great set-back owing to the ascendancy of Buddhism and Jainism and the invasions of foreigners like the Sakas and Hūnas, that when Yasodharman defeated the great Hun invader Mihirakula, people believed that the dark ages were at an end and that an era of per fect dharma was at hand. That Mihirakula was a most rutbless and blood. thirsty invader who in his long career of 70 years slaughtered myriads of men and women is stated by the Rājatarangini I. 310 ( wbich speaks of him as trikotihan) and 322 (which narrates that he slaughtered three crores of women of respectable birth together with their husbands, brothers and sons). Hiouen Chwang (Beal's B. R. W. W. pp. 171-172) narrates that Mihirakula either slaughtered or made slaves of nine lakhs of people in Gandhāra. Passages in a prophetic vein were added about the time of Yasodharman to those already existing about the decline of dharma in Kali. yuga. This will of course necessitate that all passages about Kalkin in any work wbatever were put in later than about 530 A. D. There are two theories as to who defeated Mihirakula. Hlouen Chwang's account gives the name of the victor as Bālāditya of Magadba (vide Beal's B. R. W, W, part I. pp. 167-171). On the other hand there are three inscriptions, the

he is said to have already flourished (Vāyu 98. 111, Matsya 47. 255 ), in other places the texts employ the future ( Vāyu 99. 396, Bhagavata XII. 2. 16). This last discrepancy is probably due to the fact that the writers sometimes forget their role of prophets. Further, it has to be remembered that according to the Purāņas the four yugas (and therefore the Kalki avatāra ) have been repeated again and again. The Kalki-purāpa (I. %. 33 and I. 3. 32-33 ) states that Kalki was a contemporary of Vigākhayüpa king of Māhismati, while the Vayu (99, 312-314), Matsya ( 272. 4) and Vişnu (IV. 24)-state that Viśākbayūpa was the 3rd of the Pradyota dynasty that preceded the Siśunāga dynasty. Though the Kalki-purāna several times uses the past tensa about Kalki, yet at the very beginning it says (I. 10) that what is narrated is an ākhyāna (story) of the future.

Dr. Fleet beld that Yasodharman and Vişnuvardhana were different, but the reasons he assigns are unconvincing and Jayaswal appears to be right in holding that Visnuvardhana is the same as Yasodharman (in 'Imperial History' pp. 39. 41 ) and that Vişnuvardhana was the overlord of Balāditya. It appears likely that the compilers of the extant Porānas combined the two principal parts of the two nanes Visnuvardhana and Yasodharman and that the con. queror of the Mlecchas was said to be Vişnuyasas.

commander-in-chief of the Bijapur army, is made to say to Khawaskhan, the Vazir, as follows, 'In the Hindu śāstras some say that Kalkin, the 10th avatāra of Vispu will be born and he will destroy the hordes of Yavanas. Shivaji appears to be the first harbinger of that Kalkin'. 

Even though the Purāņas are carried away by their over zeal in condemning the moral and physical decline of the Kali age, almost all of them exhibit no verses about matters for bidden in the Kali age. We have to see when the topic of Kalivarjya attained prominence and what the matters are that were once practised by people without objection and that later on came to be prohibited or condemned. 

The Ap. Dh. Ş. ( II. 6. 14. 6-10) condemns the practice of giving all or most of the ancestral property to the eldest son as opposed to śāstras. The Āp. Dh, S. (II. 10. 27. 2-6), after referring to the view of some that a woman when being married is given to the whole family of the bridegroom, condemns the practice of niyoga.2789 Both these practices (of uddhāravibhāga and of niyoga ) are among those included in the texts on Kalivarjya, Among the earliest references in the smrtis to practices once current, but forbidden in the Kali age is a passage of Bphaspati quoted by Aparārka p. 97, where niyoga and the numerous secondary sons are said to be impossible owing to the decadence1790 of spiritual power among men of the Dvāpara and Kali ages. Aparārka p. 739 and the D. M. quote a passage of Saunaka to the effect that sons other than the aurasa or dattaka are not allowed in the Kali age 1791. Prajāpati (verse 151 ) refers 1792 to the ancient practice of offering meat and wine in srāddhas, but prescribes that these should be eschewed in the Kali age.

the setting of the three vedic fires and of resorting to sannyāsa after 4400 years of Kali. The Laghu-Asvalāyana 1794 smrti (21. 14-15 ) states that the two kinds of sons called Kunda and Golaka were permitted in former ages and had the samskāras performed on them, but are condemned in the Kali age. Visva rūpa and Medhātithi, it is worth noting, do not quote a single verse about Kalivarjya. On Yaj. III. 30 Višvarūpa tries to recon cile Parāśara III. 5 (saying that a brāhmaṇa who is learned in the Veda and keeps the sacred Vedic fires becomes free from im purity in a day) with Parāśara III. 8 ( that for ten days on impurity due to birth or death the food of that family becomes unpartakable for others). He does not accept the idea that the period of impurity is only one day for a learned man, but explains that Parāśara III. 5 is only an arthavāda meant for glorifying the study of Veda and the keeping of sacred fires. Among later commentators it is stated that the narrowing down of the periods of impurity on the ground of Veda study is forbidden in the Kali age. As this explanation is not offered by Visvarūpa it is not unreasonable to infer that Visvarūpa was not aware of the passage on this point quoted from the Adityapurāņa. Medhātithi 1795 also (on Manu IX, 112 ) refers to the opinion of some that the smrti passages about niyoga and uddhāra-vibhāga were applicable. only in bygone ages, since emstis are restricted to certain ages ( vide Manu I. 85); but he refutes that view and explains Manu I. 85 by saying that the meaning is that the dharmas (i. e. qualities or natures of things) change from age to age as they do from season to season. From this it is clear that he did not accept that certain practices current in one age were forbidden in others. Vijñāneśvara 1796 quotes a single verse which condemns the practice of niyoga, the giving of a special share to the eldest son and the killing of a cow in a sacrifice as not allowable in the Kali age.

The Sm.C. quotes a verse of Kratu which forbids four acts in Kali, viz. niyoga, remarriage of a married girl, killing a cow in sacrifices and the taking of a jar.1797 The Naradiya-mahapurana contains four verses about Kalivarjya stating that certain practices which were once allowed are forbidden in the Kali age, viz. sea voyage, the carrying of a jar of water, marrying a girl of a class lower than one's own, niyoga, killing of an animal in Madhuparka, offering of flesh in sraddhas, the stage of a forest hermit, remarriage of a married girl when the marriage was not con summated, perpetual student-hood, human sacrifice, horse sacri fice, starting on the great journey, the sacrifice of a cow 1798. Aparārka ( pp. 15, 63 ) quotes one verse and a half from the Brahmapurāna about certain Kalivarjyas viz. perpetual student hood, the carrying of a kamandalu, marriage with a sagotra or sapinda girl, the killing of a cow, human sacrifice, horsa sacri fice, drinking intoxicating liquors 1799.

Aparārka (p. 98) quotes another passage from the Brahmapurana 1800, which condemns remarriage of women, niyoga, independence of women, on the ground that men in the Kali age are sinners. Aparārka (p. 233 ) quotes two versos from a smrti (without name) the first of which prohibits six acts, viz. killing a cow in sacrifice, niyoga (of husband's brother), the performance of satiras, taking a water jar, use of wine (in sautrāmaņi), being an ascetic (of the paramahamsa type) and the second prohibits five, viz. human sacrifice, cow sacrifice, the taking of a kamandalu, niyoga, and the remarriage of a girl whose marriage has not been consummated. Aparārka (p. 233 ) quotes a passage from the Markandeya recommending the offering of a golden vessel in place of the cow in Madhuparka and stating that Bhrgu laid down that no animal was to be sacrificed in Kali. The Sm. C. (I. p. 12) quotes a Purana passage that 'the remarriage of a married woman, special share to the eldest son, the killing of a cow, niyoga and the taking of a kamandalu-these five are to be avoided in Kali 1801. Hemādri and the Sahyadri-khanda state, 'Agnihotra, the killing of a cow, sannyāsa, offering of meat in śrāddha and raising of a son by the husband's brother-these five were 1802 to be avoided in Kali. Hemādri in Dānakhanda quotes a passage from the Garudapurāņa in which seven matters are mentioned as forbidden in Kali, viz. Aśramedha, Gosava, human sacrifice, Rājasūya, remarriage oven of a girl whose first marriage was not consummated, the carrying of a kaman dalu and procreation of a son on a widow by her husband's brother.

There is a work called Kalivarjyavinirnaya or Kalivarjyanirņaya composed by Damodara elder brother of Nilakanțlia (first half of 17th century A. D.), who in his Samaya mayūkha refers to it. It quotes the Adityapurana, Brahma purana and other texts that are quoted here from Hemādri and other older digests 1804 

In the passage quoted the several Kalivarjyas are not arranged on any systematic basis. Here, first of all a few Kalivarjyas that have a bearing on law will be mentioned and then the rest will be taken up one after another in the order in which they appear in the extract and lastly those that do not appear in that extract will also be dealt with. The first verse states that certain actions were discarded by the wise though this was unauthorized ( by śruti or smrti ) after arriving at a convention among themselves through fear of the loss of dharma ( if they were persisted in), because in the Kali age there is absence of good men. The last verse and a half again state that at the beginning of the Kali great men arrived at certain conven tions and discarded certain actions in order to guard the people ( against harm and sin) and (it is well known) that the conven tions of good men are authoritative like Veda 1805,

%. Appointing the husband's brother (or a sagotra &c. ) to raise issue on the wife of a sonless man. This is called niyoga and has been dealt with at length in H. of Dh, vol. II. pp. 599 607. It may be added here that in the K. V. N. there is a long discussion on the question whether an elder brother of the deceased could have been appointed to raise issue on his younger brother's widow and gives it as the opinion of some that he could not be go appointed, but that only a younger brother could be appointed to raise issue on his elder brother's widow. They rely on the Mit. on Yaj. I. 68 where 'devara' is paraphrased as * kaniyan bhrāta'. The K. V. N. (folio 5 band 6 a) relying on Manu IX, 62 and the words of the Mit. on Yāj. II. 127 (where Manu IX. 69-70 are cited and explained as 'devaras-tasya jyeşthaḥ kanistho vā) holds that any brother whether alder or younger than the husband could be appointed. 

3. 'The admission of several kinds of secondary song other than the aurasa and the dattaka. For this vide above pp. 647-653. 

4. Remarriage of widows. This subject has been dealt with in H. of Dh. vol. II. pp. 608 ff. Some texts such as Vas. 17. 74 make a distinction between the remarriage of a woman whose marriage was not consummated and of a woman whose marriage was consummated, remarriage being allowed in the first case but not in the 2nd. The Kalivariya texts forbid remarriage in both cases. 1807 

5. Intercaste marriages. . This subject has been treated of in H. of Dh. vol. II. pp. 447-451. It has been shown by me above (pp. 599-600 ) that the decisions in 46 Bom. 871 and 55 Bom. 1 are based upon a misunderstanding about the real views of Nilakaptha.

of sapiņda relationship, pp. 497 ff. for prohibition on the ground of gotra and pp. 458-463 for marriage with maternal uncle's daughter. The custom of marrying the maternal uncle's daughter has persisted to this day in many castes in spite of the inclusion of it among Kalivarjyas. An inscription at Nāgārjunikonda ( 3rd century A. D.) shows that Virapuruşa-datta, son of Santa müla, married three daughters of his paternal aunts ( E. I. vol.

7. Slaying a brahmana who comes as an atatāyin in a properly conducted fight. Vide H. of Dh. vol. II, pp. 148-151 and p. 517 above for this subject. 

8. Awarding of fines against witnesses who depose in disputes between father and son. 1808 It has already been seen (p. 299 ) how ordinarily suits between husband and wife, father and son were not encouraged in ancient India. But when such a dispute came to the king's notice he could take action suo motu, as Nār. includes 'pitāputra-vivāda' among the miscella neous matters ( prakirņaka verse 3) which the king was to set in motion. Even in ancient times this rule must not have been strictly enforced. As time went on and separation of father and son became frequent the rule must have appeared to be un reasonable. Vide Mit, on Yaj. II. 32 referred to above in n. 418, Yaj. II. 239 ( = Matsya 227. 198) prescribed a fine of 3 paņas for those who (instead of composing the quarrel between father and son and being able to do so ) undertake to be witnesses. Viśvarūpa read ' a fine of two hundred paņas'. Vişņu Dh. S. V. 120 prescribes a fine of ten paņas. This shows that at the time of the Matsyapurāņa this act was probably not included among Kalivarjyas, 

9. Taking (or stealing ) of corn even from one whose actions are lowly (i. e. even from a sūdra ), when a brahmana has been without food for six times (i. e. three days). Gaut. 18. 28-29, Manu XI. 16 and Yāj. M. 43 provide that when a brahmana cannot earn his maintenance in a season of distress even in any one of the ways indicated in Yāj. III. 4% and has been hungry for three days he may steal or take away one day's food even from a low person such as a sūdra. It should be noted that this Kalivariya text pointedly repeats the very

words of Manu XI. 16 'bhaktāni sad-anašnatā ... bartavyam hinakarmapaḥ ). In ancient times theft of such a minor nature was permitted when the brāhmaṇa was famished. But later times took a stricter view of the matter. 

10. The admission to intercourse of a brāhmaṇa who undertakes a sea voyage, even though he may have performed the penance prescribed for the same' (1.7 in the appendix ). Here the word used is 'dvijasya'. It may mean either any person of the three higher castes or a brahmana. If a man who has made a sea voyage took prāyaścitta he expiated only the sin, but did not become fit, according to this dictum, to be associated with by others. Whether the Vedic Aryans knew the sea has been doubted. Vide Vedic Index' on samudra', vol. II. pp. 431-433. The Nirukta II, 10 refers to the fact that a doubt arises whether the word 'samudra' in a particular vedio Verse refers to the sea or to the sky. In some verses as in Rg. X. 98, 5'he discharged divine rain waters from the higher to the lower samudra' both the meanings of 'samudra' (viz. sea, sky) are pointedly brought out. Vide also Rg. VII. 6.7 (a samudrad-avarādā parasmāt). In Rg. VII. 95. 2 Sarasvati is mentioned as going from the mountains to the sea. In Rg. X. 136.5 the two seas, Eastern and Western, are mentioned ( ubhau samudrāvā kşeti yaśca pūrva utāparaḥ). In Rg. VIII. 6. 4 it is said, ' all people bend down to him, as the sindhus (rivers) flow to the Ocean,' Rg. I. 116. 4-5, X. 39. 4 and X. 143. 5 refer to the story that Asyins saved Bhujyu from the waters of the sea. 1809 The Atharvavada XI. 2. 25 refers to eastern sea and northern sea. There is no doubt that in the Brāhmaṇas the sea was well-known. The Tai. Br. II. 2. 5.6 remarks,'there is no end to desire and also to samudra' (neva hi kāmasyāntosti na samudrasya). The Ait. Br. ( 40.2) remarks 'just as the sea stands surrounding the earth' (tābhi rājānam parigphya tişthati samudra iva bhūmim). It has already been seen that among the five practices peculiar to the north the Baud. Dh. 8. (I 1. 22) enumerates sean voyage ( samudra-samyāna) as the last and condemns it. Baud. (II. 1. 51) places sea voyage at the head of grave sins (patanīyāni ) along with misappro priating a brābmana's wealth kept as a deposit. The Mit.

on Yaj. IIL 288 quotes the sutra of Baud. Manu (II. 158 and 166-167) provides that a brāhmana who had been on a 888 yoyage was sinful and was not to be invited at a śraddha. But it is clear that Manu does not say that such a brāhmaṇa altogether loses caste or that he becomes alto gether unfit to be associated with; all that Manu provides is that such a brāhmaṇa became unfit for invitation at a sraddha. The Auśanagasmrti (IV. pp. 525-526) declares that those who sell the Veda, who marry a widow, who undertake a sea voyage are patita and are not to be invited at a srāddha. These passages show that the prohibition against gen voyage affected only brahmanas and even then they did not apparently become alto gether unfit to be associated with. That brāhmaṇas crossed the ocean and went to such distant countries as Siam, Cambodia, Java, Sumatra and Borneo can be easily proved 1810. E. I. vol. 17 p. 314 gives references to inscriptions from Borneo to show that brāhmaṇas from India migrated to that country about 400 A. D. That kings and merchants undertook sea voyages is also clear from several considerations. The Bāveru Jātaka ( vol. III No. 339, Fausböll) tells us that merchants, from Benares went to Babylon in order to sell Indian goods. The 'Questions of Milinda's. B.

places determine to be the proper one. Yāj. II. 38 provides for very high interest ( 20 per cent per month ) from those who engage in trade by sea. Nār. IV. 179 says that a trader ( samu dra-vanik) who makes bea voyages is not a proper witness, The Vāyu ( 45. 78-80 ) and other purāņas state that Bharata varşa 1812 has nine divisions called dvipas, all of which are separated from each other by the sea and are not (easily accessible, that Jambudvipa ( India proper ) is the 9th dvipa and the other oight are Indra, Kaseru, Tamraparpi, Gabhastimat, Nāga, Saumya (Siam ?), Gandharva, Vāruna ( Borneo ?). Therefore Bharatavarsa according to Paurāṇic Geography in cluded modern India and also Greater India. None of the ancient works at least says anything against sūdras under taking sea voyages; but now even südras, probably in their desire to emulate the brāhmaṇa and rise higher in social esteem, think that sea voyage is forbidden to them also. 

When during the latter half of the 19th century some brāhmaṇas went to England on a political mission or for study and returned to India, the question whether after taking the appropriate prāya citta those brāhmapas could be associated with fully as before was referred to many orthodox and learned Pandits (such as the late Taranātha Tarkavācaspati) and it is creditable to the Pandits and gratifying to note that many of them came to the conclusion that they could be asso 

ciated with by others. The two principal texts referred to were those of the Bphan-Naradapurana (note 1798 above) and the one from the Adityapurāņa translated at the head of this parti cular Kalivarjya. Very interesting and hairsplitting argu ments and explanations were advanced by the learned Pandite in 1872. Some of them may be noted here.. As regards the Nāradiya passage, it is argued that only that seavoyage is for bidden in the Kali, which was a righteous act (dharma) in former times. In Parāśara-smpti XII. 58 the following prāya. scitta 1813 is prescribed for brāhmaṇa murder: 'the sinner should

be directed to perform the penance of going to the setu on the ocean; he should beg for alms on the road to the setu from men of the four classes that are free from improper acts, should walk barefooted and without umbrella, should deolare his sin in all towns, villages and hamlets of cowherds on the way while resting there or in forests, sacred places and rivers and after reaching the sea and on seeing the setu, 100 yojanas long and 10 yojanas broad, constructed with heaps of stones at the bidding of Rāma by Nala he will get rid of the sin of brahmana murder'. Here brahmana murder being a most heinous offence it cannot be supposed that a mere sight of the setu from land would absolve the sinner and the words about the length and breadth of the setu would be otherwise meaningless. Therefore what is meant is that he must uudertake a sed-voyage and go along the whole length and breadth of the setu in a vessel. Such a voyage was religious conduct in former ages, but in Kali this is forbidden. The word 'holding a kamandalu' (which also was prescribed as dharma in former ages) conveys that a similar or analogous practice is referred to in the imme diately preceding words. The words 'dvijasyābdhau &o.' are to be interpreted as follows: 'nauyātuh' is the genitive singular of * naujātr'. The affix 'tr' is not the ordinary 'tr' but it is 'tṛn' used in the sense of one who habitually does a thing', accord ing to Pāṇini III. 2. 134-135. 1814 Therefore the words of the Adityapurāpa apply only to a dvija who habitually engages in a sea voyage either as a trader or as a helmsman or sailor. When Nārada (D&yabhiga 21 ) states that even an aurasa son who is hostile to his father or who is patita ( guilty of one of the five great sins) or is impotent or is 'apayatrita' he does not get a share of ancestral wealth, the Vyavahāramayūkha explains the last word as 'one who goes to another continent (other than Jambudvipa) through mid ocean by means of a vessel for purposes of trade' and relies on this passage (dvijasyabdhau &c.) for support. So according to the author of the V. Mayūkha only that dvija who constantly undertakes sea voyages for trade is here declared to be unfit for social intercourse though he may have taken a prāyascitta, and not one who casually or once in a life undertakes a sea voyage. No text prescribes a prüyagcitta merely for going in a vessel on the sea. If that were intended in this passage the text would have read different ly vix,' samudre naugamanābhāve &o.' Even sistas have been

crossing the sea to Ceylon for purposes of trade. In dramas like the Ratnāvali ( where the kañcukin Babhravya undertakes a sea voyage and a merchant from Kausambi is said to have gone to Ceylon ) and in romances like the Dasakumāracarita frequent references are made to sea voyages to Ceylon and other countries. What is aimed to be bit when prāyaścitta for sea voyage is prescribed is the fact that on such voyages a man may give up for long such daily duties as the performance of sandhyā and may have come in very close contact with mlecchas as regards food etc. If he has done these two, then only he is not fit for inter course even though he may have undergone a prāyasoitta. If he performs his daily duties wherever he may dwell and does not come in too close a contact with mlecchas he may have to perform no prāyaścitta, much less would he become unfit for social intercourse. The view of Medhātithi on Manu II. 23 that any country by itself is not unfit for the residence of an arya, that if mlecchas overrun a country in India and permanently reside there it may become a mlecchadeśa, that even a mlecoha country, if it be conquered by an Indian king and if the system of the four varnas be introduced therein, would be a fit one for the performance of Vedio sacrifices, has already been noted (in H, of Dh. vol. II. p. 16 ). It has to be remembered that the Adiparva (85, 34) states that mlecchas and yavanas sprang from Anu and Turvasu, sons of Yayāti. The Sabhāparva notes that Bhima made mlecchas dwelling beyond the seas and in Anûpa bring tribute ( 30. 25-27 ) and that mlecchas came to see the Rajasūya sacrifice along with Bhagadatta of Pragjyotisa (Sabhā 34. 9-10). The following propositions follow from the above discussion: (1) As the word 'dvija' is used a śūdra or a person of the mixed castes ( sankirna-jāti) does not become unfit for social intercourse even by habitually undertaking a sea voyage, but he may have to undergo a prāyaścitta; (2) a dvija who casually undertakes a sea yoyage to a place outside India either at the king's bid ding or for any other purpose has to undergo a prāyasoitta, but if he does so he becomes fit for social intercourse ; (3) & dvija habitually undertaking & sea voyage for trade or as a sailor would become unfit for intercourbe even after undergoing prayas citta. Manu IX. 314, when enlarging upon the devastating power of brābmaņas, mentions that the sea was made undrinkable by brāhmaṇas, which, according to Medhatithi and other commenta tors, has in view the story in Santi 343.60-61. It is difficult to say whether this story had any influence in leading to the pro hibition against sea yoyage..

The Smộtikaustubha explains that 'samudrayātrā' means tirthayatra' i. e. pilgrimage to holy places beyond the sea and that is forbidden here. But this seems to be wrong, as stated by Kronabhatta on the Nir. S. The latter says that expiation is to be undergone only where a soa voyage is undertaken from worldly motives, but where a sea voyage has to be undertaken for reaching a holy place like the Sankhoddhāra-tirtha, it is an inseparable part of the pilgrimage and therefore there is no necessity to undergo a prayascitta. 1815 

11. 'The initiation for a sattra' (1.8). Sattras were sacri ficial sessions the duration of which varied from 12 days to a year, 12 years or even more. Only brāhmaṇas could perform them (Jai. VI. 6. 16-23). Acc. to Sabara on Jai. VI. 2. 1 per sons who engaged in them must not be less than 17 nor more than 24. All of them were both sacrificers (yajamāna ) as well as priests. Vide H. of Dh. vol. II pp. 1239-1246 for sattras. The prohibition against engaging in sattras is a clear indica tion that people had become tired of the ancient Vedic sacrifices, of the great demands they made on time and wealth and had begun to prefer other and easier modes of worship. 

12. "Carrying a jar of water' (1. 8). The Baud. Dh. S. I. 4 devotos numerous 1816 sūtras (1-27 ) to the subject of carry ing an earthon or wooden jar full of water. Every snataka was always to carry a jar of water from which he was to take water for fauca. He was to wash it with water and rub it with his hand. This was declared to be equal to paryagnikarana (encir cling with fire for purification, vide H. Dh, vol. II p. 1120 n. 2501 ). . He was not to go to another's house or to the village boundary or on a journey without the jar. Vas. 12, 14-17, Manu IV. 36, Yaj. I. 133 contain similar provisions. Visva rūpa explains that the anataka himself need not carry it and that it may be carried for him by another. It was an encum brance, gave rise to unhygienic and unclean habits and so gradually it came to be dispensed with. This practice was regularised by declaring that in the Kali age a water jar was

not to be carried at all. The Madanapārijata (p. 16 ) explained that 'kamandaluvidharana' refers to perpetual studenthood, but this explanation cannot be accepted, because in the Nāradiyapurāņa (note 1798 above) both are mentioned sepa rately. The K. V. N. (folio 3 a) notes that some explained * kamandaluvidhāraṇam' as standing for 'dirghakālam brahma caryam' (studenthood for long periods). 

13. 'Starting on the Great Journey' (1.9). The Brhan Nāradiya-purāņa (pārvārdha 24. 16 ) also forbids this. Accor ding to Manu VI. 31 and Yāj. III. 55 a forest hermit, when he Buffered from an incurable disease and could not perform the duties of his order, was allowed to start towards the north-east on the Great Journey (mahāprasthana) till the body fell down to rise no more. Similarly, a man guilty of brāhmana murder was allowed to meet death at the hands of archers or to throw himself head foremost into fire. Vide H. of Dh. vol. Il. pp. 924 928 for Mahāprasthānagamana. Aparārka 1817 (p. 877-879) quotes long passages from the Adipurāņa to the effect that if a man suffering from an incurable disease starts on the Great Journey in the Himalaya or commits suicide by entering fire or water or by falling from a precipice, not only does he not incur sin, but on the contrary he goes to heaven. It is rather inconsistent that the Adipurana (or Adityapurāņa ) should in one place extol the starting on the Great Journey and in another place should forbid it in the Kali age. The K. V. N. cites the instance of the Pandavas that are said to have started on the Great Journey. This makes one suspicious about the authenticity of the passages on Kalivarjya quoted from the Adityapurana by some and from Adipurāņa by others. 

14. 'The killing of a cow in the sacrifice called Gogava' (1.9). 

There were various occasions on which in ancient times & cow was sacrificed. The Anubandhyā cow killed at the end of the Udayaniyā işti in Agnistoma has been referred to above (on p. 627 n. 1196). In the Madhuparka which was offered

to an honoured guest a cow was either killed or let loose at the desire of the guest. Vide H. of Dh. vol. II pp. 543-545. A cow was killed in one of the three or four aştakā sraddhas ( vide Khādira gr. III. 4.1, Gobhila gr. II. 10. 16). Ap. Dh. S. II. 7. 16. 25 states that if cow's flesh is offered in sraddha for the pitrs, the latter are gratified for one year. There was a sacrifice called Gosava or Gomedha, that was an Ukthya in which the fees were ten thousand cows and which according to some could be performed only by & vaisya (Kāt. Śr. 22. 11. 1818 3-8). A bull was killed as an offering in the rite called śūlagava ( vide H. of Dh. vol. II pp. 831-832 ). As flesh-eating came to be looked down upon, cow sacrifice became most abhorrent and Kalivarjya texts only register a prohibition which had been acted upon centuries before. 

15. "The employment of cups of wine in the Sautrāmapi' (1. 10). 

The Sautrāmaņi is not a soma sacrifice but it is a combi nation of an işti with an animal sacrifice. It was so called from sutrāman' (an epithet of Indra). Its peculiar charac toristio was the offering of surā in cups. In modern times milk is offered in its place and Ap. Śr. allowed it even in ancient times 1819. It was included among the seven haviryajñas by Gaut. (VIII. 20). At the end of the Rajasüya it was performed or in Agnicayana or for one who suffered vomiting or purging from the excessive drinking of soma. For sautrāmani and the preparation of surā in it, vide H. of Dh. vol. IL pp. 1225-1228. Bhattoji (in com. on Caturvimsati-mata p. 53 ) and the Nirnaya sindhu construe this to mean “having social intercourse with one who employs surā in Sautrāmaņi' but this is not satis factory. The Dharmasindhu explains as above (III. purvārdha p. 357 ) 1820

16. The licking of the Agnihotrahavaṇl and the use of it even after it was licked'(1.11). In the Agnihotra the sruva ladle is held in the right hand and the sruc called agnihotra havani is held in the left and the milk is poured into the latter from the milk pot with sruva. After the Agnihotra homa is offered the agnihotrabavani is licked twice in order to take out the remnants of the milk and after wiping it with darbha blades it is used again. Ordinarily a vessel when it is once licked by a man cannot be used again in a religious rite unless proper purification is resorted to. But this did not apply to the Agni hotrahavapi and camascus of soma. Vide H. of Dh. vol. II p. 1002, n. 2663 for agnihotrahavani, p. 1005 for its licking and p. 1177 (n. 2598) for the drinking of soma from the same camasa by the several priests. The licking of the agnihotrahavaṇl and its use constitute really the subject of the prohibition. 1821 

17. 'Entering on the stage of forest hermit as laid down in the texts about it' (1. 12). Gaut. III. 25-34, Ap. Dh. S. (II. 9. 21. 18 to II. 9. 23. 2 ), Manu VI. 1-32, Vas. IX. 1-11, Yaj. III. 45-55 lay down elaborate rules for the stage of forest hermits. Vide H. of Dh. vol. II pp. 917-929 for a description and remarks on sannyāsa to be made later on. 

18. "The narrowing down or curtailment of the periods of impurity depending upon the Vedic learning and the mode of life of a person' (1. 13). 'Agha' means 'asauca'; *vitta' (mode of life) refers to tending sacred fires or maintaining oneself in the way described by Manu IV, 7-10. The general rule about the period of impurity for a brāhmaṇa on the death of a sapiņda was stated by Gaut. 14. 1, Manu V. 59 and 83 to be that it was ten days and Angiras quoted by the Mit. on Yāj. III. 22 prescribes impurity for ton days for all varpas, but Manu V. 59 also spoke of the period being four days, three days or one day, which, acc. to the Mit, on Yaj. III. 28–29, refers respectively to kumbhidhānya, one who has collected food for three days or one who collects nothing for the morrow. Dakş& VI. 6 and Para

(vol. 

šara 1822 III, 5 both state that a brāhmaṇa who keeps the Vedic fires and has studied the Veda becomes free from impurity in a day, one who has only studied the Veda ( but does not tend sacred fires ) becomes free in three days, while one devoid of both becomes free after ten days. Aparārka (p. 894) and Haradatta on Gaut. 14. 1 quote Bṛhaspati to the same effect. The Mit. remarks 1823 (on Yaj. IIL 28-29) that the curtailment of the period of impurity is not absolute but is restricted only to certain special matters viz. the receiving of gifts, the performance of Agnihotra, the study of the Veda and such matters in which distress would be caused if the period were not curtailed. This explanation clearly proves that Vijñanes vara ( end of 11th century ) was not aware of the prohibition of the curtailmont of the periods of impurity or treated it with scant respect. The curtailment of the period of impurity was laid down probably because curtailment led to confusion, since a person may claim to be learned, while his neighbours may not concede that claim. 

19. 'Prescribing death as the penance for brāhmaṇas'. (1. 14). 

Manu XI. 89 provides that if a person intentionally murders a brāhmaṇa there is no expiation for it. Manu XI. 90 prescribes death by drinking boiling wine for the sin of drinking sura, while Manu XI. 146 provides 1824 that if a man knowingly drinks wine there is no expiation for it, but only death. The Vispu dharmaputra (chap. 34 ) states that incest with the mother, daughter or daughter-in-law is atipātaka, such sinners have to

enter fire and there is no other penance for this sin. Vide Gaut. 21. 7 also. Some smrtis held that there was no prāyasoitta for certain grave sins except falling from a precipice or into fire. As a brahmana's person became more and more sacred with the march of time, death ceased to be a penance for a brāhmaṇa ginner, however grave the sin might be. But this did not apply to a kşatriya or any one else (other than a brahmana). 

20. *Pollution through contact with a sinner' (1.15). Manu XI. 180 ( Santi 165, 37 = Baud. Dh, S, II. 1. 88 ), 1825 Vişnu Dh. S. 35, 2-5 provide that if a person continues for one year in close association ( sarsarga) with one guilty of the grave sins ( enumerated in Manu XI. 54 ), in respect of occupy ing the same conveyance or seat with him or dining in the same row with him he becomes patita; but he becomes patita immediately if he officiates as a priest. for such a sinner or performs his upanayana for teaching him the sacred Gāyatri and the Veda or if he enters into a matrimonial alliance with him, Parāśara ( I. 25-26 ) states that in the Kfta age a person became patita by speaking with a patita, in Tretā by seeing him, in Dyāpara by pārtaking of food prepared in his house, but in Kali by actually committing a (sinful ) deed and that when a grave sin was committed by a man, in the Kộta age the whole district in which he lived was to be abandoned, in Tretā the village, in Dvāpara his family alone and in Kali only the perpetrator. 1826 Parāśara ( XII. 79 ) no doubt 1827 says that sins (i. e, pollutions are caused ) are transferred, as a drop of oil ( spreads ) on water, by sitting or sleeping together or by using the same conveyance, by speaking with or by dining in the same row with a sinner'; but this only means that to associate with a sinner is bad, but it does not mean that to associate with a patita immediately makes the associator himself a patita. The Mit. on Yaj. III. 261 quotes Devala 1828 and Vfddha-Bșhaspati to the effect

(Vol. 

that samsarga arises in nine ways viz. by talk, by touch, by breathing the same air (i. e. by being in the same room ), by being in the same conveyance or on the same seat or bed, by dining in the same row, by being a sinner's priest or vedic teacher or entering into matrimonial alliance with him. The Par. M. says that Parāśara held the view that there was no pātitya by the various kinds of contact in Kali and so provided do prāyaścitta for samsarga. The Nirnayasindhu 1829 and Bhattoji make similar remarks. The Udvāhatattva says that Parāśara I 25 is to be interpreted in this way that merely speaking or touching a patita or receiving money from him does not make another liable to any prāyascitta, but that if the association with a patita goes quite beyond these, then sin may be incurred by association. So almost all the digests are agreed that the rigour of the very strict rules about samsarga in Manu and Baud. was modified by declaring that speech with or sight of a sinner involved no sin in Kali. 1830 

21. "Undergoing (secret) expiation for the grave sing (mabāpātakas) except theft' (1. 15). Harita ( q. by Par. M. II. 1831 part 2, p. 153 ) prescribes secret expiation for a brāhmaṇa who has studied dharmaśāstra and committed a sin without anyone knowing it. Gaut. (chap. 24) prescribes certain expiations to be undergone secretly (without any third person knowing of such performance ) for even mahāpātakas such as brāhmaṇa murder, drinking surā, incest and theft of gold. Vas. (chap, 25) also does the game and states ( 25. 2) that only those who have kept the sacred vedic fires, who are disciplined and old or learned are entitled to secret expiations for sins and not other people. The Vispu Dh. 8. 55 deals with seoret expiations. Parāśara IX. 61 (last verse) laid down 1832 the general rule that one should openly

declare one's sin. The Kalivarjya text provides that secret expia. tion is allowed as regards only theft among the mahāpātakas in the Kali age, though in earlier ages it was allowed as to other mahāpatakas also. The Nirnayasindhu says that secret expia tion is allowed only to brāhmaṇas. According to the Dharma sindhu, in the Kali age if a man is guilty of the murder of a brāhmaṇa or of other mahāpatakas he does not avoid the conse quences of falling into Hell when he undergoes an expiation but he becomes only fit for social intercourse, while as regards theft of gold ( a mahāpātaka ) by undergoing prāyaścitta he avoids the fall into hell and also becomes fit for social intercourse. The Kalivarjyayinirpaya appears to hold that all secret expia tions are forbidden in Kali, 1833 

22. "The act of offering an animal with the recital of Vedic mantras to the bridegroom, to a guest and in honour of pitrs' (1. 16).1834 Madhuparka was offered in ancient times on several occasions and to several persons such as to ștviks at sacri fices, to the king, to a snātaka, to one's ācārya, father-in-law, paternal or maternal uncle and to a bridegroom. Vide H. of Dh. vol. II. pp. 542-546 for details about Madhuparka. Originally a cow or a bull was killed for an honoured guest, later on when the cow came to be extremely sacred the flesh of some other animal was offered; when flesh-eating itself came to be looked down upon then only payasa and other vegetarian eatables came to be prescribed. Vide H. of Dh. vol. II pp. 777-782 on flesh-eating. This half line forbids the offering of flesh to a bridegroom or to an honoured guest (in madhuparka) and the feeding of

brālimaņas with flesh at śrāddhas. Comparatively so late a writer as Yāj. (I. 258-259 ) extols the high gratification that the Manes feel when flesh of various animals is offered in śrāddhas. This one prohibition includes in itself several prohibitions that are separately mentioned in other texts such as govadha' (in notes 1797 and 1799), the killing of an animal in a Madhuparka (in n. 1798), 'gavalambba' and 'palapaitrka' (in note 1802). It is noteworthy that even so late as the first half of the 17th century Viśvanātha, a great logician, takes up the cudgels on behalf of flesh-eating by brāhmaṇas in sacrifices, sraddha, madhuparka, in danger to life and when ordered by a brāhmaṇa and charges those who totally forbid flesh-eating with being the followers of the doctrines of Bauddhas, while the latter at the same time prescribe expiations for even murderers of brāhmaṇas through greed of money and marry their maternal uncle's daughters or other sapiņdas of their mother, though both of these latter are forbidden by the Kalivarjya texts. 1885 

23. Association with those that are guilty of intercourse with women who are not of the same varpa, even though the former may have undergone proper expiation for the lapse' (1. 18). There was great divergence of views as regards the prāgasoitta for adultery by a male with a female of the same olags, of a higher class or of a lower class. Further the ancient gūtras were rather hard on the guilty parties, the harsh rules being relaxed by later smrti writers. For example, Gaut. 23. 14-15 and Vas. 21. 1-3 prescribe for a male of a lower caste having intercourse with a woman of a higher caste death in Various ways. If a brāhmaṇa had sexual intercourse with a cāndala or svapāka woman Parāśara (X. 5–7) prescribes that he bas to undergo a fast for three days, tonsure of the head together with the top knot, three Prājāpatyas, Brahmakūrca, feeding brāhmaṇas, constant recital of the Gāyatri, gift of two pairs of cows and then he becomes pure, while a südra doing the same had to undergo the expiation of one Prājāpatya and had to make a

gift of two cows. If a person of a low caste has intercourse with & woman of a higher caste ( e. g. a sūdra has intercourse with a brāhmaṇa woman) Samyarta ( verses 166-167 ) prescribes the expiation of subsisting for a month on cow's urine and yāvaka (barley gruel) for him. If a brāhmaṇa commits adultery with a śūdra or cāndala woman Samvarta (verses 169-170) prescribes the expiation of cāndrāyaṇa, while Parāśara (X. 17-20) prescribes a far more severe expiation. The present text prescribes that, even after undergoing expiation, men guilty of intercourse with women of castes other than their own cannot be allowed to have social intercourse with their castemen, The Dharmasindhu 1836 says that śūdras that have intercourse with brāhmaṇa or other women of a higher caste are hereby declared to be unfit for social inter course even after they undergo expiation. This no doubt made for strictness in morals, but it also led to the preservation of caste exclusiveness. 

24. 'Abandonment of a mother (or other woman who is to be honoured owing to relationship) because she has had sexual intercourse with one of low class' (1. 19). 

The provisions of the sūtras and smstis on the subject of expiation for adultery by women varied from time to time. Gaut. 23. 14 and Manu VIII. 371 prescribe that a woman who has intercourse with a man of low caste is to be punished by the king with being devoured by dogs. But other smrtis and Manu himself (XI. 177) are not so harsh, but are rather humano in their treatment of adulteresses. Manu XI. 176 says that the husband should keep confined to one apartment his corrupt wife and compel her to perform the expiation which is prescribed for males in cases of adultery. Manu XI. 59 and Yāj. III. 235 regard adultery by a male (pāradārya) as an upapātaka and Manu XI. 117 and Yaj. III. 265 prescribe cāndrāyana as an expiation for all upapātakas. Vas. XXI. 12 prescribes that the wives of men of the three higher castes who are guilty of adultery with a sūdra may be purified by an expiation. if no child is born of the intercourse but not otherwise. Yāj. I. 72 provides that a woman becomes free from the taint of adultery when she has her monthly illness after the adultery but if she conceives in adulterous intercourse she may be abandoned. The Mit. on Yāj. I. 72 states that both Yaj. and Vas. are to be

(Vol. 

understood in the same sense and abandonment does not mean driving out of the house but only not allowing her to participate in religious acts and not having sexual intercourse with her. Vas. XXI. 10 states that only four kinds of women are to be abandon ed, viz. one who has intercourse with the husband's pupil or with the husband's guru, one who attempts to kill her husband or one who commits adultery with a man of a degraded caste. Yāj. (III. 296–7 ) provides that to women that are patita the same rules apply as to men, but they should be given food, raiment and protection and that intercourse with a man of low caste is one of the three gravest sins for women. Vide Mit. on Yaj. III. 297. The present text states that a woman (such as a mother) who is entitled to honour from a person because of her relation ship ( as mother, elder sister etc. ) is not to be abandoned and cast on the street by him, although she may be guilty of adultery with a degraded or low caste man, in spite of Vas. XXI. 10 and other texts (such as Br. ). 1837 That is, this text was more humane to such women than ancient texte. Krspa bhatta explains that 'gurustriyāḥ' means of a brāhmaņa woman'. Vide H. of Dh. vol. II pp. 571-573 for further remarks on adulterous women. Ap. Dh, s. I. 10. 28.9 requires the son always to serve and wait upon the mother even though she may be patita. Atri 1838 (195-196) and Devala (50-51) contain two Verges (almost in the same words ) which are lax as compared with other ancient texts. They say: "If a woman conceives through intercourse with a male who is not of her caste, she becomes impure till her delivery. When she is delivered or she has her monthly illness after the intercourse she becomes like pure gold'. Atri (197-198 ) further provides that whether a woman willingly has sexual intercourse or is deceived or is enjoyed against her will or in secret, she should not be abandoned; one should wait till the monthly illness and she becomes purified by that illness'.

the later smitis of Devala and Atri is remedied by this Kali varjya text which forbids abandonment of only such women as the mother, but allows the abandonment of others when guilty of intercourse with a male of low caste. Devala prescribes expiation by sāntapana in the case of those women that are raped by mlecchas and conceive (verses 47-49 ). Vide also Atri 201-202. The Sm. Kau. restricts this half verse to the mother alone. Parāšara ( X 24-25) prescribes that if a woman be raped once she becomes free from pollution by undergoing Prajapatya after she has her monthly illness and in other cases of rape she has to undergo Santapana. 

25. 'Sacrificing one's life for the sake of another' (1. 20). The Visnu Dh, S. III. 45 states 1839 that those who are killed in saving the life of a cow, a brāhmaṇa, the king, a friend, one's wealth and one's wife go to heaven and XVI. 18 provides that even those (untouchables) who are outside (the pale of the four varņas) and sacrifice their life for brāhmaṇas, for cows and for women and children attain heaven. The Adityapurāņa quoted in Rājadbarınakšņda (p. 91 ) has a similar verse. The Samaya mayükha and Bhattoji quote a smrti, 'one should at once saori fice one's life for cows and brāhmanas, 1840 This text forbids self-sacrifice of one's life simply for the promised reward of heaven in the cases specified. The K. V. N. (folio 9b) offers two more (rather far-fetched) explanations of this phrase, one of which is offering one's services as a serf to another. This is probibited to members of the three twice-born classes in Kali, but not to the sūdras, acc. to K. V. N. 

26. 'Offering (of food) to another that remains after one has partaken of it' (1. 20). In the Madhuparka the honoured guest used to partake of a part of the offering of honey, milk

and curds and was to give the remainder to a brāhmaṇa (or a son or a younger brother). This is prohibited by this Kalivarjya text. Vide H. of Dh. vol. II. p. 544 for this practice. Ap. Dh. S.( I. 1. 4. 1-6) provides that the pupil may partake of the leavings of his teacher's food, but the teacher should not give him honey or meat or other food which will be opposed to the observances of a vedio student. The Nirnayasindhu reads 'uddistasyāpi varjanam'1841, which means 'not accepting what has been donated,' Yāj, I. 213 says that if a person worthy of accepting a gift does not keep it for himself (but passes it on to others), he secures the highest worlds obtained by those who make generous gifts. Bhattoji gives another explanation. Vas (14, 21 ) forbids a man to eat the remnants of his own food or to eat food that comes in contact with the leavings of food. This Kalivariya text sets aside for the Kali age the prohibition con tained in Vas. 14, 21 (acc. to Bhattoji). The K. V. N. (folio 10 a) states that this is the explanation given by some, but does not approve of it. The Sm. Kau. gives yet another but extremely far-fetched explanation. 1842 These several explanations of the same half verse indicate how some of the Kalivarjya texts are comparatively recent and have no settled meaning even accord ing to comparatively late writers of digests. 

27. "The resolve to offer worship (throughout life ) with various details to a certain idol (1.21 ). 

It is not easy to see why such a resolve should have been prohibited. Therefore this explanation given by Bhattoji, K. V. N. (folio 10 a), the Samayamayakha and others is not satisfac tory. It is better to accept the explanation of the Nir. S. that this forbids the undertaking of the worship of a particular image for wages. Aparārka (pp. 450 and 923) quotes a smrti text defin ing a devalaka as a brāhmaṇa who performs the worship of an

to officiate at $rāddhas.1843 Manu III. 152 declares the devalaka to be unfit for being invited for šrāddhas or rites in honour of gods and Kullūka quotes Devala to the effect that one who maintains himself on the treasury of a shrine is called deyalaka. It is remarkable that Vṛddha-Harita (VIII. 77-80) says that only the worshippers of Siva for wages are called devalaka and those of Visnu are not. Acc, to the Sm. Kau. what is forbidden is the resolve to worship an image for securing a direct vision of the Deity.1814 This is rather pedantio and far-fetched. 

28. Touching the bodies of those ( who are impure on the death of a relative ) after the collection of the bones' (1.22 ). The day on which the bones were to be collected after the body was cremated differed greatly according to various writers. The Mit. on Yaj. III. 17 notes that according to Saṁyarta 1845 (verse 38) the bones may be collected on the first, third, seventh or 9th day, that the Vişnu Dh. S. (19. 10-11) prescribes the 4th day for it and recommends the casting of them into the Ganges, that some did it on the 2nd day and that therefore everyone should follow his own Gșhyasūtra. The Mit. on Yaj. III. 18 quotes Devala to the effect that, after the lapse of one-third of the period of impurity prescribed for members of the four varnas (as in Yaj. III. 22), persons who lost relatives become touchable, that members of the four varnas become touchable in three, four, five and ten days respectively. Samyarta (verses 39-40) states that, after the collection of bones, touching those who are under pollution due to death is allowed on the 4th, 6th, 8th and 10th day respectively in the case of brāhmaṇas, ksatriyas, vaisyas and sūdras. The present Kalivarjya text forbids this and becomes stricter as to the rules about impurity. 

29. The performance by a brāhmaṇa of the duties of the killer of the victim in a sacrifice' (1. 23 ).

History of Dharnasāstra 

[Vol. 

The animal in a grauta sacrifice was to be killed by choking it and strangling it. The person who did so was called samitr. Different views were entertained as to who was to be the samitr, Acc, to Jai. III. 7. 28-29 1846 the adhvaryu himself was to be the samits; the usual opinion was that he was to be some one other than the striks. The Āśv. Sr. (XII. 9. 12-13) shows that he may be a brāhmaṇa or a non-brāhmaṇa. For further details vide H. of Dh. vol. II. pp. 1121-22, n. 2504. As animal sacrifices themselves came to be looked down upon or even forbidden, this text forbids a brāhmaṇa from being a samitr. 

30. The sale of the soma plant by brāhmaṇas' (1.23). 

Soma beverage was to be drunk only by brāhmaṇas. The soma plant had to be purchased and there was a symbolic haggling for it. The vendor of soma in ancient1847 times was, aoo. to Kāt. Sr. VII. 6. 2-4 and Ap. Śr. X. 20.12, either a brāhmaṇa of Kutsa gotra or any brāhmana or a sūdra.1847 In later times, though Manu XI. 7 ( = Sānti.165, 7 ) and Nār. ( dattāpradānika 7 ) 1848 allow a brāhmaṇa who has wealth sufficient for the maintenance of himself and his dependents for three years or more to perform a soma sacrifice, yet Manu III. 158, Yaj. I. 165 and Vas. 14. 3 hold that a brābmana who sells the soma plant is unfit to be invited at a śrāddha and that one should not partake of food at his house. Manu X. 88 forbids a brāhmaṇa to sell water, arms, poison, soma &c. Vide H. of Dh. vol. II. pp. 1141-1143 for purchase of soma and the dramatic haggling for it. 

31. 'Allowing a brāhmaņa householder to eat food at the houses of four classes of people among sūdras viz, his slave, his cowherd, a hereditary family friend and one who cultivates his fields on the basis of paying a half or other portion of the produce to him' ( 11. 25–26 ). 

Gaut. 17. 6, Manu IV. 253 (=Vişņu Dh. S. 1849 57. 16), Yāj. I. 166 and Parāśara XI. 19 say that a brāhmaṇa may eat the

food of these four and of his own barber. Haradatta on Gaut. 17, 6 and Aparārka (p. 244 ) remark that a brāhmapa can take the food of these persons among südras only in the event of extreme calamities. From this it appears that up to the 12th century A. D. the peremptory prohibition contained in this text was either unknown or was not much respected. The exclusive ness of caste in matters of food and marriage was made more strict by the Kalivarjya texts. Vide above ( pp. 869 and 885 ) as to how Parāśara himself was overruled by this text. 

32. 'Pilgrimages to very distant holy places '(1. 26). 

A brāhmaṇa was called upon to tend his Vedic or grhya fires. If he went to distant places on pilgrimage this duty would be interfered with. It is provided by Ap. 1850 Sr. IV. 16. 18 that even when on a journey the agnihotrin has, after turning his face in the direction of his fire altar, to go mentally over the whole procedure of his daily fire worship and the Darśa pürşamāsa. The Gobhila-smrti II. 157 says the same. The Smstikaustubha 1851 says that this prohibits pilgrimage to holy places beyond the sea or on the borders of Bharatavarşa. This text prohibits a brāhmaṇa from going to distant places on pilgrimage, but it does not prevent him from undertaking & journey for earning wealth for performing sacrifices. K. V. N. (folio 10a ) quotes a text of Satyavrata to this effect. 

33. *The rule that a pupil should habitually observe the same behaviour towards the wife of the guru as towards the guru himself (1.7). Ap. Dh. 1852 S. I. 2.7. 27, Gaut. II. 31-34, Manu II, 210, Vişņu Dh. S. 32. 1-2 prescribe that a student should perform the same acts of honour and obedience towards the wife or wives of his teacher as towards the teacher (except holding her feet in doing obeisance and eating the leavings of the food). As students were often grown-up young men and the teacher's wife might often be a young lady, Manu II. 212,

History of Dharmaśāstra 

(Vol. 

216, 217 ( that are the same as Vişnu Dh. S. 32. 13-15) provide that a pupil full twenty years old should not show honour to the young wife of his teacher by clasping her feet, but that he may prostrate himself on the ground before the teacher's young wife in performing obeisance and that he may hold her feet in obeisance only (once) when he returns from a journey. This text accepts the principle underlying the special rules laid down by Manu and Vişnu and prohibits the daily touching of the feet of the guru's wife on the part of the pupil. The Sm. 1853 Kau. and Dharmasindhu (III p. 353 ) hold that this sets aside the rule laid down in Yāj I. 49 that a perpetual student may stay till his death with his teacher or with the teacher's son or (in default of both ) with the teacher's wife. 

34. "The modes of maintenance conceded to brāhmaṇas in times of distress (or calamity)' (1.28). 

The special modes of maintenance prescribed for brāli mapas were receiving gifts, teaching the Veda and officiating as priests (Gaut. X. %, Āp. Dh. S. II. 5. 10. 5, Manu X. 76, I. 88, Vas. II. 14, Yaj. I. 118). But it was recognised from very ancient times that if a brāhmaṇa could not maintain himself by following the above modes of earning wealth he could in a season of distress pursue the avocations peculiar to a ksatriya or vaisya (Gaut. VII. 6-7, Baud. Db. S. II. 2. 77-81, Vas. II. 22, Manu X, 81-82, Yaj. III. 35 ) 1854 Vide H. of Dh. vol. II. pp. 118 133 for detailed treatment of this matter and for the restric tions imposed even when brāhmaṇas were allowed to follow the avocations of ksatriyas and vaisyas. The Kalivarjya prohibi tion is merely one on paper. From ancient times till now brahmanas have pursued all sorts of avocations and hardly any importance has been attached to this dictum. 

35. *Not acoumulating any wealth (or grains) for the morrow' (1.28). Manu IV.7 and Yāj. I. 128 provide that brāh manas are of four kinds, viz. those who acoumulate grain of the capacity of a kusula, those who accumulate grain of the capa city of a kumbhi, those that accumulate grain enough to satisfy

their needs for three days and those who do not collect grain even for the next day. The smộtis prescribe that each later one is superior in merit to each preceding one. The commen tators differ as to the meaning conveyed by kugūladhānya (some holding that it means one who has accumulated grain for three years, while others say it means one who has grain for 12 days) and kumbhidhānya (a person accumulating grain for a year, or grain for six days). Vide H. of Dh, vol. II. p. 110, note 234 and p. 641 note 1502. The Mit. on Yāj. I. 128 says that the advice not to accumulate corn even for three days or one day is not addressed to all brāhmaṇas, but to those only who are called yāykvara 1855. This explanation of the Mit. indicates that the Kalivariya text on this point was either not known to the Mit. or was not much thought of by it. The Kalivarjya text provides that the ideal of extreme poverty and absence of acquisitiveness for brāhmaṇas was not to be insisted upon in the Kali age. 

36. 'The acceptance of the kindling of a log of wood (i. e. setting up sacred Vedic fire) at the time of the homa of Jatakarma for the purpose of securing long life to the child born to a person' (1. 29). The aranis are two logs of Aśvattha tree from which fire is produced by attrition, which (fire) is used for kindling the gārhapatya fire. In certain sākhās, it is the prac tice to kindle fire from aranis and to use it for the homa in the Jātakarma rite. This fire was to be used in the subsequent rites for the child such as cūda, upanayana, marriage. It was supposed that this enabled the child to live long. 1856 The Sam K. quotes a parisista text to this effect.1857 

37. 'Constant journeys by brāhmaṇas' (1. 30). The Mahābhārata (Santi 23. 15 ) 1858 says, 'As a snake swallows mice hiding in holes, the earth swallows two persons viz, a king who does not fight (an invader) and a brāhmaṇa who does not engage

38. 'Blowing on fire with the mouth' in order to kindle it into flames (1 30 ). Gaut. IX. 32, Manu IV, 53 and Brahmapurāna 221. 102 forbid the blowing on fire with the mouth ( as in doing so it is likely that drops of saliva from the mouth may fall into the fire and pollute it). Haradatta on Ap. Dh. S. I. 5. 15. 20 notices that in the Vājasaneya Sākhā it is said that fire should be kindled into flames by blowing upon it with the breath from the mouth since it sprang from the mouth of the Creator (as stated in the Puruşagūkta, Rg. X. 90. 13). Therefore, acc. to Haradata and the Gobhila-smrti (I. 135-136) 1859 the srauta fire could be kindled by blowing upon it with the mouth, but smārta fire or ordinary fire should not be kindled in that way (but only by using a fan or a bamboo cylindrical piece ). The Kalivariya text forbids blowing with the niouth even on srauta fire. 

39. ' Allowing social intercourse to women who have become polluted by rape and the like(when they have performed prāyasoitta) as prescribed in the sāstras' (1. 31).1860 Vas. 28. 2-3 state,' when a woman is polluted by being raped or kidnapp ed by a thief, she should not be abandoned; one should wait till her monthly illness (making her undergo certain expiations till then ) and she becomes pure after it.' Atri ( V.2-3) has the same verses, which are quoted (from Vas..) by Visvarūpa on Yāj. III. 256 (p. 133. Tri. ed.) and explained at great length. The Matsyapurāņa 227. 126 is liberal enough to say that the man who commits rape should be punished with death but the woman raped incurs no blame. Parāśara ( X. 27 ) provides that if a woman is raped by an evil-doer only once she becomes pure by undergoing the Prā jāpatya expiation and after the follow ing monthly illness. Even so late a smrti writer as Davala provides that if a woman of any class is raped by mlecchas and she conceives she can be purified by the expiation of Santapana.

40. 'Begging of food by a sannyāsin from members of all varpas (including sūdras ) according to the rules of the śāstra' (1.32). The Sm. M. p. 201 (on varņasrama) quotes Kathaka Brāhmaṇa, 1861 Āruņi Up., Parāsara ( in prose) to the effect that a yati may beg for food from members of all varņas. Baud. Dh. S. II. 10.69 1862 also quotes a verse which allows the begging of food from all varņas to a yati. Vas. X. 7 requires a yati to beg at seven houses not selected beforehand and in X. 24 states that he should subsist on what food he gets at the houses of brāhmapas. 1863 The present text requires even the yati to observe caste rules as to food. 

41. 'Not using for ten days fresh rain water' (1. 33). Haradatta on Ap. Dh. S. L 5. 15. 2, Bhattoji on Catur. (p. 54), Sm. Kau. p. 479 quote a verse,' she-goats, cows, she-buffaloes and brāhmaṇa women become free from impurity (due to delivery ) after ten nights and so does fresh rain water accumulated on the ground'. According to this the long period of ten days in the case of rain water is set aside. But Bhattoji notes that accord ing to another smrti 'rain water falling at the proper season is pure, but it is not to be used for drinking for three days; when rain falls at an unusual season rain water is impure for ten days and if a man drinks it within that period he should abstain from food for one day and night'. Bhattoji remarks that the Kalivarjya text only sets aside waiting for ten days, but does not set aside the rule against drinking it for three days.

History of Dharmasastra 

[Vol 

The ancient practice was to make no agreement as to fees for teaching. Vide Bs. Up. IV. 1.2. Gaut. (II. 54-55) prescribes 1865 that at the end of his studies the student should request the 

· teacher to accept the wealth that he could offer or ask the teacher what should be given and after paying or doing what was required by the guru or if the teacher permitted him to go without demanding anything the student' should take the ceremonial bath. Vide Manu II. 245-246 and H. of Dh. vol. II. pp. 360-361 for details. Yāj. I. 51 provides that at the end of his studies the student may give to the teacher what he desires (or a cow ) according to his ability or may with his permission take the ceremonial bath (without paying anything). On account of these provisions we have stories in the ancient litera ture that very rarely teachers or their wives made fanciful demands. This Kalivarjya text only gets aside the require ment of paying what the guru demands, but does not prohibit the voluntary gift of a fee by the student. 1866 

43. "The engagement of a sūdra for such acts as cooking and the like in the houses of brāhmaṇas and the rest' (1. 34). Ap. Dh. S. (II. 2. 3. 1-8) requires that 1867 the food for Vaišva deva should be prepared by pure men of the first three yarnas and also optionally allows a sūdra to be a cook for an ārya pro vided he is under the supervision of men of the first three varpas, provided he sips water whenever he touches the hair, any limb or his garment, provided he cuts the hair (on his head and his body), the beard and nails every day or every 8th day of the month or on the new and full moon day and provided he bathes with the clothes on. It is this permission that is set aside by this Kalivariya text. 

44. Suicide of very old people by falling into fire or from a precipice' (1.35 ). 

This is analogous to No. 13 above. Atri did not condemn suicide in certain cases. He states, 1868 (verses 218-219) ' if one be

old ( beyond 70), if one cannot observe the rules of bodily puri fication (owing to extreme weakness), if one is so ill that all medical help is discarded, and if one in these circumstances kills himself by throwing himself from a precipice or into fire or water or by fasting, mourning should be observed for him for three days and śrāddha may be performed for him.' Apar ārka (p. 536 ) quotes several smộtis to the effect that a very old man or one suffering from very serious illness, one who has no desires left and has carried out his tasks may bring about his death by entering firo or water or falling from a precipice and he will incur no sin. Vide H. of Dh, vol. II. pp. 926-92? for further details. This text may also be taken as forbidding suicide by falling from a precipice or into fire as an expiation in the case of those that are guilty of mahāpātakas knowingly committed. The Mit. on Yāj. III. 226 quotes a smrti to this effect 1869, The Suddhitattva holds (pp. 284-285) that suicide by entering water and the like is allowed in Kali only to śüdras and forbidden to brāhmaṇas and others. 

45. "The performance of acamana (purificatory sipping of water) by sistas in as much water as is sufficient for slaking the thirst of a cow' (1. 36). 

Manu V.128, Vas. III. 35, Baud. Dh, S. 1. 5. 65, Yāj. I. 192, Vispu 23. 43 provide 1870 that water collected on the ground is pure (and may be used for acamana) provided it is sufficient in quantity to slake the thirst of a cow. But this text forbids on hygienic grounds the use of small quantities of water collec ted on the ground for sipping and similar purposes, 

46. The residence of an ascetic in the house near which he happens to be in the evening' ( 1. 38). 

Aco, to Āp. Dh. S. II. 9. 21. 10 and Manu VI. 43, 55-56, an ascetic was to kindle no fire, was to be houseless and was to beg only once a day in the afternoon or evening when no smoke ascends from the kitchens of people, when the embers have been extinguished, when pöople have finished their meals &o.

History of Dharmasastra 

( Vol. 

12-15) provides 1871 that a sannyāsin was to change his residence frequently, was to stay at the boundary of the village or in a temple, or in an empty house or at the bottom of a tree and should constantly live in a forest. Sankha (VII. 6) states that an ascetic should stay in an empty house or he may stay wherever he may be when the sun sets. This provision of Sankha is set aside by the Kalivarjya text. Another meaning of the words, according to Kysnabhatta on the Nir. S. (p. 1310), is that this runs counter to the recommendation of Manu VI. 56 that an ascetic should go for begging to the houses in a village in the evening when all smoke from kitchens has ceased i. e. by this text he is allowed to beg in the noon. In a way this appears to be a better explanation. 

The above is a complete list of all Kalivarjyas quoted from the Adityapurāņa (except one or two). Some of the Kalivarjyas not included here, but included in other texts cited above will also be now set out for the sake of completeness of treatment. 

47. 'Resorting to sannyāsa'. Vyāsa quoted above ( n. 1793) forbade sannyāsa in the Kali age after 4400 years of it had elapsed, but then Devala 1872 made an exception to this extent that as long as the division of society into four varnas existed and as long as the Veda was studied sannyāsa could be resorted to even in Kali. The Nir, 8. explains that what is forbidden is the sannyāsa with three dandas and not the sannyāsa with one danda. Baud. II. 10. 53 (ekadandi vā ) gives an option that a sannyāsin may carry three staffs or one, while Yāj. III. 58 speaks of a yati as only tridaņdi. Daşda meas a staff and also 'restraint, curbing". Manu XII. 10 (same as Dakşa VII. 30) declares that that man is called tridandi who has restraint over his body, speech and mind. Dakşa1873 also says that a yati is not called tridandi by carrying three bamboo staffs, that he is called tridapdi who has

the spiritual restraint in him (v. 29). In I. 12-13 Dakşa says that just as a girdle, deer skin and a wooden staff are the outward signs of a vedic student, 80 three staffs are the peculiar sign of a yati. Vide H. of Dh, vol. II. pp. 937-938 for further details. If the Kalivarjya text were meant to forbid sannyāsa altogether, it must be said that it was never honoured and even now thousands become sanngāsins every year. If, as the Nir. S. says, this text only forbids the carrying of three daņdas, it is a meaningless prohibition, giving importance only to outward symbols and not to the substance of the matter. 

48. "The observance of aynihotra' or the acceptance of three fires'. Vyāsa (n. 1793 ) forbade the performance of srauta agnihotra along with sannyāsu in Kali, but an exception was made by Devala in favour of its observance as also of resort to sapnyāsa on the grounds stated above (in No. 47). Some digests and authors such as the Nirņayasindhu 1874 and Bhattoji explain that agnihotra of the sarvadhāna type is forbidden in Kali, but that of the ardhādhāna type is allowed. Agnihotra means 'adhāna', that is, setting up of the srauta fires. When a man consecrates the three srauta fires he may do so with half of his smārta fire and keep up the other half of the smārta fire. This is called ardhādhāna. If he does not keep the smārta fire separate, it is sarvīdhūna. Laugākşi quoted by the Nir. S. (III. p. 370 ), Bhattoji and others states this. The Mit, on Yāj, III. 45 mentions these two modes. Therefore, according to these explana tions, sarvadhāna was allowed in former ages (and acc, to one interpretation up to 4400 years of Kali), while in Kali (or at least after 4400 years of Kali) only ardhādhana is allowed. 

49. 'Human sacrifice' (vide note 1798 giving extract from Nāradapurāna). 

The Tai. Br. 1875 ( 11I. 4. 1-19) contains a description of the procedure of human sacrifice. The oldest texts even do not show that a human being was killed. The whole procedure is

(Vol. 

symbolical. The Vāj. S. (XXX. 5 ff.) has many passages in common with the Tai. Br. The Tai. Br. III. 4.1( = Vaj. S. 30.5) begins,' the brāhmana should be offered to brahman (spiritual power ), the ksatriya to ksatra (military power), the vaisya to the Maruts' &c. Acc. to Āp. Śr. XX. 24, a brāhmana or ksatriya performs this sacrifice, whereby he attains power and valour and all prosperity. There are eleven sacrificial posts and eleven animals to be offered to Agni and Soma. After the rite of paryugnikarana is performed on the brāhmaṇa and others, they are presented to the several deities and then discharged from the sacrificial posts, eleven goats are killed and oblations of their flesh and limbs are offered. Acc. to the coin, on Vāj. S., it is begun on the 10th day of the bright half of Caitra and goes on for 40 days, which are occupied with 23 diksās, 12 upasads and five sutyas ( days on which soma is extracted). After this yāga, the yajamāna usually resorted to a forest as a sannyāsin. 1876 

50. “Ašvamedha'(n. 1798). The Tai, S. V.3.12.2 states, 1877 "he who performs the Asvamedha becomes free from (the sin of) brahmana murder'. In spite of this Vedio authority the Bphan Nāradiya and other purānas prohibited it. But no one heeded this prohibition and numerous historio kings performed this sacrifice from at least 200 B, O, to Jayasing in the 18th century A. D. Vide H. of Dh. vol. II. pp. 1238-1239 and .pp. 70-71 above for numerous historical performers of Aśvamedha. 

51. "Rājasūya' (acc. to the Garudapurāna, p. 929 above). This was a very complex rite extending over two years and could be performed only by a ksatriya. Vide H. of Dh. vol. II. pp. 1214-1223 for a brief description. The Rājasūya was per formed by the Kalinga Emperor Khāravela as he proclaims in his Hāthigumpha Inscription (E. I. vol. XX p. 71 at p. 79) and by queen Nayanikā as stated in the Nāṇāghāt Inscription (A. S. 

W. I. vol. V. p. 60). 

52. 'Perpetual studenthood' (n. 1798). Vedic students were of two kinds, upakurvāra ( who offered some return or fee at the time when they returned home) and the naişthika (who remained students till death). Vide p. 764 n. 1471 above,

Hārita, Dakşa 1878 (1.7) and others mention these two varie ties, while Yaj. I. 49, Vedavyāsa I. 41 and Visnu Dh. 8. 28. 46 name and describe the naişthika. Manu II. 243-244, Yāj. I. 49-50, Vas. VII. 4-5 provide that a perpetual Vedic student should stay with his teacher till his own death, that on the teacher's death he should stay with the teacher's son or the teacher's wife or should tend fire, that if he curbs his senses till his death, he reaches the world of brahma (immortality) and is not born again. This was a very diffi cult mode of life, there were great temptations as the flesh is weak and therefore the Bphan-Nāradiya and others prohibited perpetual studenthood. Some works such as the Madanapārijāta (p. 16), the Kalivarjyavinirnaya of Damodara, and the Nir, S. read 'dirgha-kālam brahmacaryam' in place of 'naisthikam brahmacaryam' in the Bșhan-Naradiya. 

53. 'Brahmacarya for long periods' (n. 1799). The Baud. Dh, S. (1.7.1-5) declares, "the term of studentship for Veda study as observed in ancient times lasted for 48 years, or 24 years, or 12 years for each Veda or at least one year for each kāņda (of the Tai.S.) or it lasted till the Veda was committed to memory, as life is evanescent and as the Veda ordains let him kindle the sacred fires while his hair is still black'." The Āp. Dh. S. (1. 1. %. 11-16 ) provides that the student's stay with the teacher's household should be 48 years, 24 years or 12 years at the lowest. Manu III. 1 also states that the vow of studying the three Vedas under a guru must be observed for 36 years or for half of that time or for a quarter of it or until the student has mastered (the Veda). These long periods of 48 years, 36 or 24 years for Veda study (before a man could become an house holder) are here forbidden in Kali. This was nothing new. Yāj. I. 36 had allowed 12 years for each Veda or five and if a man did not want to study all vedas but only one he could finish his studenthood in five years. Only an extremely small number could have spent 48 or 36 years in Veda study. Sabara on Jai. I. 3. 3 held that this text of Band. was opposed to the fruti about kindling fires when a man was a young householder with black hair and was to be discarded. Vide pp. 832–834 above for a

perpetual studentus of Āp. and Band uns prohibition was 

discussion of this. The authors of the Samayamayūkha and the Sm. Kau, both of whom had before them the reading *dirghakālam brahmacaryam' held that this prohibition was aimed at the words of Ap. and Baud. and that the vow of perpetual studentship which was undertaken with a special purpose in view ( viz. realization of brahma and non-return to samsūra) was not prohibited by the Kalivarjya text and that there was nothing wrong in the practice of perpetual student hood among the Dravidas. 

54. 'Animal sacrifice.' In the Mārkandeya as quoted in Apararka p. 929 above animal sacrifice was forbidden in the Kali age. Though popular feeling had gradually veered round to the view that meat should not be offered in śrāddhas, in madhuparka (No. 22 above), yet animal sacrifices were performed at all times and are even now performed, though very rarely. 

55. "Intoxicating drinks ( madya)'. There were startling vicissitudes in the attitude to intoxicants. 

In Vedic times soma was a beverage drunk by the priests and surā was a beverage for common men and usually not meant to be offered to the gods. Soma and surā are sharply distinguished (vide Tai, S. II. 5. 1. 1, Vāj. S. 19.7, Sat. Br. V. 1. 5. 28). The Sat. Br. (V. 1. 5. 28) has the striking antithesis 'For, Soma is truth, prosperity, light; and surā is untruth, misery, darkness'. In the Sautrāmaņl işti a brāhmaṇa had to be hired for drinking the dregs of surā offered in it and if a brāhmaṇa could not be found the surā was poured on an ant hill (Tai. Br. I. 8. 6 and Sabara on Jai. III. 5. 14-15). It appears from the Kathaka-bambitā XII. 12 that 1879 brāhmaṇas had by that time come to regard the drinking of surā as sinful. From Chān. Up. V. 10.9 it appears that a drinker of surā was enumerated among five grave sinners. In the Asv. gr. II. 5. 3-5 it is said that in the rites of the Anvaştaka day when pindas are offered to the male ancestors, the female ancestors viz. the mother, the paternal grandmother and great-grandmother are offered surā and the scum of boiled rice in addition 1880.

p. 367) refers to this passage of the Aśy. Gr. and holds that the Kalivariya text against intoxicants forbids this also. 

Madya is a generic term applicable to all intoxicating drinks; surā is said to be of three kinds, viz. that prepared from molasses, that from honey (or madhūka flowers or from grapes) and that from corn flour (Manu XI. 94, Visņu Dh, S. 22. 82 and Sasvarta 117 ). The Vişņu Dh. S. (22. 83-84) specifies ten kinds of madya, all of which a brāhmaṇa was not even to touch. Gaut. II. 25 1881, Ap. Dh, S. I. 5. 17. 21, Manu XI. 95 forbid all kinds of midya to brāhmaṇas at all stages of life. Ap. I. 7. 21. 8, Vas. I. 20, Manu XI. 54, Vişnu Dh, S. 35. 1 hold that the drinking of surā is one of the five grave sins (mahāpātakas), while Yāj. III. 227 employs the word 'madya' in place of surā in this connection. Baud. Dh. S. I. 1. 22 however notes that among the five practices peculiar to the brāhmaṇas of the north was that of drinking rum and Baud, condemns it. The verses of Manu XI. 93–94 about the three kinds of surā have been the subject of frequent and varying interpretations. Visvarūpa on Yāj. III. 222, the Mit. on Yāj. III. 253, Aparārka p. 1069 and others establish that the word 'surā.' primarily applies to paişti ( liquor prepared from flour ) alone, that paişti is forbidden to all brāhmaṇas, kşatriyas and vaisyas, that it is the drinking of paisti alone that constitutes a mahāpātaka, that all intoxi cating drinks are forbidden to brāhmaṇas in all ages, but in toxicants other than paişti ( such as those prepared from molasses or madhūka flowers) are not forbidden to ksatriyas and vaisyas. Manu XI. 93 says that surā is the refuse of cooked food ( rice); therefore members of the three higher castes should not drink surā. This clearly shows that Manu took surā as meaning only paisti ( liquor prepared from rice flour). The Vişnu Dh. S. ( 22. 84) expressly says that kşatriyas and vaibyas are not polluted by touching the ten kinds of madyas specified by it. In the Udyogaparva (595) both Vasudeva (Krşņa) and Arjuna are described as intoxicated by drinking the liquor prepared from honey and the Tantra vārtika establishes that there was nothing wrong in this as both were kşatriyas. Intoxicants were not forbidden to sūdras. Brahmacarins of whatever varṇa had to abstain from intoxicants of all kinds. Aparārka 1882 (p. 63)

after quoting the Brahmapurāņa states that intoxicating drinks were forbidden to the three varnas in Kali and to brāhmanas in all yugas (ages). But this is opposed to tradition. The Adiparva (chap. 76 ) narrates 1883 that Sukrācārya prohibited for the first time brāhmaṇas from drinking intoxicants (vide H. Dh. vol. II. pp. 792-799 for detailed discussion of this topic). The Kalivarjya text forbids the drinking of intoxicants to all the three twice-born classes. But ksatriyas and vaisyas pay scant attention to this prohibition and even some brāhmaṇas in these days have taken to drink as a fashionable indulgence. The K. V, N. (folio 5a), Krsnabhatta 1884 and Sm. Kau, note that in the sākta treatises (called Vāmāgama) madya is allowed to be offered to the idol for all the three varnas and to ksatriyas in the propitiatory rites for Vināyaka and for birth on the Müla con stellation but this kalivarjya text forbids all that. 

An analysis of these 55 kalivarjyas yields very interesting results. About one-fourth out of the above 55 relate to Srauta matters. There are several texts forbidding Agnihotra, Aśvamedha, Rajasüya, Puruşamedha, sattras, Gogava, animal sacrifices, while a few others are concerned with matters of detail in sacrifices (vide. No. 11, 14-16, 29-30, 38, 48-51, 54). The first nine of these 55 are concerned with legal matters and relations. Some prohibitions are due to growing caste exclusive ness ( No. 5, 10, 31, 40, 43). Others again spring from ideas of greater insistence on the sacredness of the marriage tie, a stricter morality and a demand for greater decency and purity, particularly in women ( No. 2, 3, 4, 9, 15, 23, 24, 33, 39, 55 ). A few are based on notions of compassion, justice and equity (No. 1, 8, 24, 25, 42). Some owe their origin to the growing sacredness of the brāhmaṇa's person and his high social position (No. 7, 10, 27, 29, 30). Some must have been suggested by hygienic considerations (No. 12, 16, 28, 38, 41, 45), some arose from strict ideas of sin, expiation and ceremonial purity and impurity (No. 13, 18-21, 28, 44). Two of these, when they

prohibit the stage of forest hermit and of sannyaga, strike at the very root of the ancient scheme of āšramas. 

The chapter on Kalivarjyas can be employed as a very effective answer to those who trot out the theory of the 'unchang ing East'. Social ideas and practices undergo substantial changes even in the most static societies. Many of the practic es, that had the authority of the Veda (which was supposed to be self-existent and eternal) and of such ancient smộtis as those of Ap., Manu and Yāj., had either come to be given up or had become obnoxious to popular sentiment. This fiction of great men meeting together and laying down conventions for the Kali age was the method that was hit upon to admit changes in religious practices and ideas of morality. The Kalivarjya texts are also a complete answer to those who hold fast to the notion that dbarına (particularly ācāradharma ) is immutable and un changeable (aparivartaniya). This chapter on Kalivarjya unmistakably shows how the most authoritative dicta of the Veda and of ancient sages and law-givers were set aside and held to be of no binding authority because they ran counter to prevailing notions and furnishes a powerful weapon in the hands of those who want to introduce reforms in the incidents of marriage, inheritance and other matters touching modern Hindu society. One can further see how some practices still persist in spite of the prohibitions in the Kalivarjya texts viz. marriage with one's maternal uncle's daughter, sannyāsa, agnihotra and even srauta animal sacrifices (rarely). 

Some works add two more to the Kalivarjya verses which mean, 'imprecations, omens, dreams, palmistry, listening for supernatural voices or messages, promises to make presents to a deity if a certain prayer were granted, prophetic replies by astrologers to questions, may rarely turn out to be true. One should not, however, resort to these through the desire to secure results from them. Similarly there are other actions also (that have to be abandoned) in the Kali age, because they have come to be 

included (by people ) under improper acts (adharma).' 1885

From the fact that no ancient smrti speaks of Kalivarjya, that the ancient commentaries of Visvarüpa, Medhatithi and even Vijñānesvara do not cite long lists of Kalivarjyas, that such lists first make their appearance in the Smartyarthasara, the Sm. C. and Hemādri ( works and authors of 12th and 13th centuries), the most probable inference is that these lists of Kalivariyas were first put together at the earliest in the 10th or 11th century A.

1886. An attempt at a systematical collection of the Kalivarjya texts and elucidation thereof was made by me in a paper submitted to the 8th All ladia Oriental Conference held at Mysore in December 1935. The paper was published in the Journal of the Bombay Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society, vol. 12 pp. 1-18 (New Series ), 1936. Recently ( 1943 ) Mr. Batuknath Bhattacharya has published a book which contains a full treatment of Kalivarjyas. He states in the preface that it is an exact reprint of the thesis for Jogendrachandra Ghose Research Prize in Comparative Indian Law for 1933', that the subject is comparatively fresh and unexplored' and that the treatment is on lines marked out by the writer himself. He claims that bis work is 'original as a whole except one sec tion on secondary sons'. He does not state exactly in what year the thesis for a prize of 1933 was submitted to the Calcutta University. Presumably a thesis for a prize of 1933 should have been submitted in 1934 or 1935 at the latest. No satisfactory explanation is given why the thesis was published in 1943, so long after the year of the prize, nor does he mention my paper published so far back as 1936. It appears from quotations in tbe book as printed that it was probably retouched, if not actually written, after 1937. For example, on p. 76 be quotes a passage from the Smrtimuktāphala (section on Varnāsrama p. 201 ), which was published by Principal J. R. Gharpuré only in 1937 in Devanagari. If the original thesis was written or revised in or after 1937 my paper published in 1936 should have been mentioned. Mr. Batuknath Bhattacharya in his paper 'the sources of dharma and their comparative authority' published in the Proceedings of the 10th Oriental Conforence at Tirupati beld in 1940 refers to my paper on Kalivarjyas (p. 160 ) as 'brief and compact'. This shows that he knew my paper years before he published his work in 1943. The claim of the subject belag * unexplorod' and the thesis being ' original' is bardly admissible. 

CHAPTER XXXV 

CUSTOMS IN MODERN INDIAN LAW 

Though an elaborate treatment of customs in niodern Anglo-Indian Law is far beyond the scope of the present work, yet a few words on customs in modern times may not be altogether out of place here. When the British began to acquire political domination in India they realized the importance attach. ed to customs by all persons in India and the Charter of the Mayor's court at Bombay in 1753, unconsciously following the ancient dicta of Manu (VII. 203 ) and Yaj. (I. 343), contains the earliest trace in British royal charters of a reservation to the peoples of India of their laws and customs. 1887 The British Parliament and the Indian Legislatures have allowed customs to occupy a very high place in the administration of law and justice. The preamble to 21 Geo. III chap. 70 ( 1781 A. D.). recited that one of the purposes for which the Act was passed was that the inhabitants of Bengal, Bihar and Orissa should be maintained and protected in the enjoyment of all their laws, usages, rights and privileges and sec. 17 of that Act provided among other things that, in the case of the inhabitants of Calcutta, their inheritance and succession to lands, rents and goods and all matters of contract and dealing between party, and party shall be determined in the case of Mahomedans by the laws and usages of Mahomedans and in the case of Gentus by the laws and usages of Gentus 1888 and, where only one of the parties shall be a Mahomedan or Gentu, by the laws and usages of the defendant. 37 Geo.

The burden of proving a custom opposed to the general law or in derogation of the ordinary rights of another lies heavily on the person alleging it, 1889 The decided cases lay down several essentials of a valid custom. In order to make a particular custom valid it must be proved to be immemorial or ancient, uniform, certain, reasonable, obligatory and it must not be immoral or opposed to public policy or to any express enactment of the Legislature. What antiquity must be proved before a custom can be accepted as valid depends upon the circumstances of each case, 1890 When it is said that a custom must be ancient it is not meant that the antiquity must be darried back to a period beyond the memory of man. According to the Mit. on Yāj. II. 27 smārta-kāla (time within living memory) in relation to possession means a period of one hundred years, while according to Katyāyana and Vyāsa it is only a period of sixty years. 1891 On evidence of the prevalence of a custom even for 20, 30, 80 or 90 years the Courts have held that a presumption may arise that the custom is ancient and that if the presumption is not rebutted the Court may accept it as a valid and ancient custom. 1892 Many instances have generally to be adduced for proof of a custom. No bard and fast rule can be laid down about the number of instances required to prove a

custom. 1893 In certain cases it has been held that specifio instances are not absolutely necessary, but the opinions of persons likely to know the existence of the custom is entitled to great weight, even though they may not be able to cite specific instances. 1893a Customs once prevalant, particularly family customs, may come to be dis continued on account of accident, change in popular sentiment or by the concurrent will of all the members concerned. 1894 Customs must be strictly construed and cannot be extended by analogy or parity of reasoning. Because in a particular caste marriage with a maternal uncle's daughter is allowed by custom 

it does not follow that marriage with a maternal aunt's or paternal aunt's daughter will necessarily be valid. Vide H. of Dh. vol. II. p. 467 notes 1095-6. The evidence about a custom should be such as to prove the uniformity and continuity of the usage, the conviction of those following it that they were acting in accordance with law and the consciousness of obligatorines and the custom should not spring from mere habit, imitation and ignorance or mutual arrangement. 1895 A custom must not be unreasonable. A custom of excluding daughters from inheritance was held to be not unreasonable according to the ideas of the Hindu community. 1896 A custom that only members of certain castes (and not of others) were entitled to make use of a temple and to worship therein was held not unreasonable in India, though it may appear obnoxious to cultured people at the present day. 1897 

Oustoms must not be immoral. Whether a custom is immoral is to be judged by the sense of the whole community 1998.

A custom which authorizes & woman of the lower castes to contract a second marriage without divorce on payment of a certain sum to the caste was held to be immoral 1899 and the Bombay High Court refused to recognize the authority of the caste to declare a marriage void or to give a woman permission to remarry without a release from the husband. 1900 The adop tion of girls by dancing girls ( naikins ) has not been recognized by the Bombay High Court, 1901 though the Madras High Court would recognize such an adoption if there was no intention to make it for purposes of prostitution. 1902 Dagger marriages are practised among certain castes. The Brahmapurāņa (chap. 111. 15 and 44-46 ) states that among kşatriyas there are several forms of marriage such as forcibly carrying away the bride (which is the form called rākşasa ) or marriage with the weap ons (of the bridegroom). In modern times dagger or sword marriages have not been held valid by the courts even among gūdras; vide Maharaja of Kolhapur v. Sundaram 48 Mad. 1, Ram Saran v. Mahabir 61 I. A, 106. 

Many customs and usages have been expressly forbidden by the Central Indian or Provincial Legislatures e. g. Sati 1903, female infanticide, 1904 slavery, 1905 marriages of children under a certain age, 1906 the dedication of women as devadāsis to tem ples or idols. 1907 This being so, no court will allow a party to plead a custom against these positive enactments.

But Bombay Act XI of 1926 (the Invalidation of Hindu Ceremonial Emoluments Act) now enacts ( by sec, 4 ) that no person shall be entitled to claim as a matter of right any ceremonial emoluments from any Hindu who does not call in the services of the person claiming those emoluments. Therefore, su its of the nature described above cannot be brought now in Bombay by a vatandar joshi. 

How customs and practices once prevalent may come to be discontinued or abrogated is well illustrated in the section on Kalivarjyas. Soine of those that have a legal bearing have been already discussed above. 

APPENDIX 

NOTE 191 Long lists of high functionaries and other officers occur in several inscriptiong. Vide E. I. vol. VII at p. 91 (Kahla plate of Sodhadeva ), E. I. vol. XII at p. 40, E. I. vol, XIV at p. 327 ( grant of Mahipāla). There are about 40 titles in some ins criptions. They are generally arranged in order of dignity and importance, the highest coming first. Sometimes several offices are held by the same man. For example, in the Jesar plate of Silāditya ( dated in Valabhi year 357 ) the high officer Mammaka is styled 'sandhivigrahadhiksta, divirapati, mahā pratihāra, sāmanta'( E. I. XXII at p. 120 ). It is not claimed that the following is a thoroughly exhaustive list. It is, how over, exhaustive enough. Titles and dignitaries in South Indian languages have been generally omitted. Vogel stands for Dr. Vogel's work on 'Antiquities of Chamba State' where, on pp. 120-136, he furnishes informing notes on some officers. There is difference of opinion among scholars about the exact mean ing of certain office names. The individual functions of several officers are not quite clear. The references given here as to where an office occurs are not exhaustive. Chronologically older references alone are generally given and they are mostly taken ( so far as inscriptions are concerned ) from the Epigra phia Indica (E. I.) and the Indian Antiquary (I. A.). Many official titles have the word 'maha' prefixed without any change in meaning in some cases. Vide India Office Plate of Laksmanasena in his 27th year (E. I. XXVI. p. 1 at p.) for many official titles beginning with 'mahā'. 24te -Vide Mahaksapatalika below. 'Akşapatala' means

This word has given rise to various opinions. Fleet and Bübler translate as irregular soldiers'. Vogel (pp. 130-132) points out that Chamba is the only place where the ancient word 'cāta' is still extant in the modern form 'chat' meaning "head of a pargana'. Grants of villages are often expressed as 'acā tabhatapraveśya' (not to be entered by cātas and bhatas)'. For example, in the Surat plate of Maitraka Vyāghrasena (E. I. XI at p. 221 ) it is stated that the granted land was not to be entered by cātas and bhatas except for seizing ) robbers and those guilty of harm or treason to the king. Similar words occur in the Betul plates of Sankşobha in Gupta year 199 ( acā tabha tapraveśyam coradrohakavarjam) in E. I. VIII p. 287. The words occur also in the Khoh plate of Mahārāja Hastin in Gupta year 191 (Gupta Ing. No. 23 p. 106). Yāj. I. 336 states that it is the duty of the king to protect people from the harassment caused by catas, robbers and kāyasthas and the Mit. explains cāta' as persons who deprive people of their wealth after producing false confidence in them. Three quarters of the same verse occur in the Pañcatantra I p. 72 Verse 343. Aparārka (p. 792) quotes Bphaspati that 'dangers conmon to all are those arising from cātas and thieves'.
