SADACARA 

CUSTOMS AND MODERN CUSTOMARY LAW1606 

From Gautama 1606 downwards many writers dilate upon the sources of dharma. Gautama. I. 1-2 states: ' the Veda is the source ( mula) of dharma and also the tradition (or smṛtis ) and practice of those who know the Veda'. Similarly Ap. Dh. S. (I. 1. 1.1-%) says: 'we shall propound the acts (that produce merit) which are evolved from conventions and practices; the authority ( for finding out the dharmas) are the conventions of those who know the dharma and the Vedas'. Vas. I. 4-7 pro vides: 'dharma is declared by the Vedas and Smptis; on failure of these two the practice of the sistas is the authority (for finding out what dharma is); a sista however is one whose heart is free from (worldly ) desires and (only ) such acts of sigtas are ( to be held as ) dharma for which no ( worldly

or secular ) cause (or motive) can be assigned'. 1607 Manu II. 6 and Yaj. I. 7 declare that Veda (or sruti), smrti and the practices of the good are the principal sources of dharma. The words employed in these works are fila, samaya, ācāra or sadācāra or sistācāra 1607 (the latter three meaning the game thing ). Ap. employs both words viz. samaya and ācāra, the first of which probably means 'agreement or convention or usage', while the latter means 'custom'. The word 'custom' now conveys the idea of some antiquity, 1608 while usage or convention does not necessarily convey that idea. A usage may be recent or it may be established by agreement among a certain class of persons ( such as traders or craftsmen ). We have to see what is meant when it is said that ācāra or śiṣtācāra or sadācāra is the source (mūla) of dharma. An indication of the meaning is furnished by the word pramīna employed by Ap. and Vas. The meaning is that just as the revealed books (Veda) and the smrtis authoritatively lay down what dharma is, so also in our quest to find out what dharma is in the varying circumstances of life the practices of those who may be called sistas furnish us with the necessary criterion or norm i. e. $iṣtācāra is the touchstone for judging whether an act is in consonance with what the Śāstras require us to do. The theory of the ancient writers was that the smrtis were based on parts of Veda ( that consists of mantras and Brāhmaṇa texts ) which though formerly existent are not now extant or available, that similarly the practices of those who were learned in the Vedas and were deemed to be śistas must be inferred to have been based on portions of Veda not now available. This theory was advanced by such ancient 

1607. As to the qualifications of sistas, vide H. of Dh, vol. II. pp. 971– 72 wbere references are given to Baud. Dh. S., Mapu, the Matsyapurāna and a few other works. The Tai. Up. I.: 11 contains perhaps the oldest extant indication as to who should be regarded as sistas, though that word itself is not used.

writers as Āp. 1609 and was taken up by many subsequent works. Manu II. 7 also states that whatever dharma has been ordained for any person by Manu, all that has been entirely declared in the Veda for the Veda is full of all knowledge. But it does not follow from this nor is it ever meant that all practices of bistas are authoritative in matters of dharma. The qualifica tion was added that where the practices of sistas are clearly referable to or are prompted by a seen motive or by the desire to secure pleasure, there they are not authoritative. Manu (II. 18 ) restricted the word sadācāra to the customs handed down from generation to generation among the four varnas and the mixed castes in the country called by him Brahmā varta ( II. 17). But many other writers did not so restrict it in this way, 

We have to distinguish between what are called the sources (mūla or pramāṇa ) of dharma and the sthānas of dharma (Yaj. I 3 and 7), 1610 The former indicate to the inquiring spirit what dharma is (i.e. they are what are called jñāpaka hetu ), while the latter must be studied as aids by the expounders of dharma in order to correctly grasp what dharma is, i.e. the different lores (other than Veda and smrti ) are not directly the sources of dharma, but are only mediately so. This distinc tion is an ancient one as even Gautama XI. 19 provides that the king is helped in his administration of justice by the Veda, the dharmaśāstras, the auxiliary lores ( angas), the Upavedas and the Purāṇa. 1611 

The position of the Purvamsmāmgā in relation to the authoritativeness of smrtis and customs requires careful and

detailed consideration. In I. 3. 1-2 1612 Jaimini considers the question whether such smrti injunctions as one should perform the Astaka sraddhas',1613 or 'one should construct a tank or set up a prapā (place for free distribution of water to thirsty travellers'), or 'tufts of hair should be kept on the head' (at caula according to the gotra ) are authoritative and establishes the conclusion that they are authoritative, since such smrti injunctions equally with Vedic ones are addressed to the same persons (viz. the followers of the Veda ) who have to act according to them. The idea is that those who perform the acts expressly enjoined by the Veda are also seen to perform the acts enjoined by such smrtis as that of Manu and therefore the principal reason why these smṛtis are authoritative is the fact that those who know the Veda accept these smrtis as authorita tive and hold fast by them, as Medhātithi on Manu II. 6 says citing some verses from his own work called Smrtiviveka. 1614 Sabara endeavours to show that there are indications (linga) in the Vedic texts pointing to the existence of what is prescribed in the smrtis e.g. he cites the Vedic verse 'yam janah' as indicative 

1612. धर्मस्य शब्दमूलत्वादशब्दमनपेक्षं स्यात् । अपि वा कर्तृसामान्यात्प्रमाणमनु मामं स्यात् । जै. I. 3. 1-2 The word अनुमान is here used in the sense of स्मति. 'भपिया पक्षो ज्यावय॑ते । प्रमाणं हि स्मृतिः । ... अन्धस्स्वनुमीयेत कर्वसामान्यास्मृति वैदिकपदार्थयोः । तेनोपपलो वेदसंयोगस्वर्णिकानाम् ।' शबर; about अष्टका he says 'अष्टकालिङ्गाश्च मन्त्रा दे हश्यन्ते यो जनाः प्रतिनन्दन्तीत्येवमादयः ।।. That verse is, यो जनाः प्रतिनन्दन्ति रात्रि धेनुमिवायतीम् । संवत्सरस्य या पत्नी सा नो अस्तु सुमडाली। This occurs in आप. म. पा. II. 10. 27, in पारस्करगृह्य III. 2 and in अथर्ववेद III. 10. 2 where we have या देवा: etc. Acc. to प्रभाकर the topic of Jai. I. 3. 1-2 is not such smrti texts as those on Aṣtakā, but the Vedic verse at wat: itself. The न्यायसुधा p. 126 adds 'अटाकायै सुराधसे स्वाहेति तस्याटकादेवतारात्रिप्रकाश. कत्वादेषा बै संवत्सरस्य पत्नी पदष्टकेति संवत्सरपत्नीत्वसंस्तुताष्टकाप्रकाशकत्वाशाष्टका लिङ्गवं स्पष्टमेवेति'. The word कतसामान्यात in the sutra is explained in the मयूखमालिका as 'अग्निहोत्रादीनां वैदिकपदार्थानां ये कारस्त एव अटकादिरसतीनामिति कर्वसामान्यात्मामाण्यमुक्तम् । (on जै. I. 3. 4 p. 21): while the न्यायसुधा (p. 125) proposes also another explanation ' यद्वा स्मृतिकतणां मन्यादीनां वैदिकपदार्थकता तदानींतनानी शिष्टानां त्रैवर्णिकत्वेन समानस्वात् इदानींतनधमन्यादीनामप्युपएलो वेद संयोग इत्यधः .

Authoritativeness of smrtis

of astakās, Rg. X. 4. 1 of prapas, Rg. VI. 75. 17 of tufts of hair. The objection may be stated as follows The smrtis are composed by human authors (i. e. they are pauruṣeya ) and so have no independent authority in matters of dharma, as a man may say what is either false or mistaken. If it be said that the smṛtis really propound what is stated by the Veda, then they are practically superfluous and useless. and not being Veda they should be discarded (anapeksa ) To this the reply is that smṛtis are generally authoritative, as they must be held to be based on Veda because they are composed by men (like Manu ) who were followers of the Veda, because what the smrtis lay down has been consistently followed from generation to generation by the sistas and because it is possible to regard the Veda as their source. To the question why the Vedic passages on which the smrti rules are postulated to have been based are not seen or found by us several answers were proposed by different writers. One view was that just as Vedic indications about locks of hair lead to the inference of śruti texts enjoining the keeping of tufts on the head, so the fact of the existence of such rules leads to the inference that śruti must have contained injunctions corres ponding to all smrti prescriptions. Kumārila raises objections to this view. Inference is based on perception (pratyakṣa ) and invariable concomitance (vyāpti). There is no vyāpti between the smṛtis and śruti texts that are never found pro nounced by any one, so no inference is possible and it would be like one blind man following another.1615 Manu must have composed his smṛti on finding that ācāryas preceding him performed certain acts as based on Veda. These last must have believed that their predecessors also acted on the same belief, Hence there is what is called an 'andha-paramparā' on this hypothesis. And further this hypothesis of the inference of Sruti in all cases is opposed to perception, since as a matter of fact hundreds of Śruti passages are known that can be the basis of corresponding smrti texts. Another view is (and Kumārila holds that it is somewhat better than the preceding view ) that one should infer that the Vedic passages that were the basis of smptis are lost ( utsanna or pralīna). Some support is lent to this by such Vedic texts as ' anantā vai vedah' (Tai. Br. III 10.

11)and by Ap. Dh. S. I. 4. 12. 10. Even this view is not acceptable to the Tantravārtika and most of the Mīmāṁsakas. The objection against the 2nd view is raised as follows. Even Bauddhas and other heretical sects 1616 would advance the argument that their works also are based on śruti texts that are now lost, and any one may regard anything as authoritative by pretending that the basic vedic texts are lost. Further the Mimāṁsā view that the Veda is eternal ( nitya ) would be refuted if it were admitted that some portion of the Veda is lost. There is not much difference between the first view and the second view. Therefore Kumārila propounds the third view viz. that smṛtis are to be inferred as based on Vedic texts that are already in existence 1617. If an objection is raised against this hypothesis that it must be explained why such Vedic texts ( the bases of smrtis ) are not seen or found, the Tantravārtika replies in a famous kārikā that as the Vedic śākhās (the several branches of the Veda) are scattered about (in various countries), as men (followers of the Veda) are negligent and unmindful (i.e. they do not visit all the countries and so are unable to have a complete knowledge of all Vedic texts ) and as several rules are declared in different contexts even when occurring in the same sākhā (and not at one place ) it is not always possible to point out the Vedic sources of smrti texts. If an objector were to ask : 'why were not the Vedic passages themselves (that are the sources of smrti rules ) embodied bodily into the smrtis,' Kumārila replies that this was not done from the fear of the loss of the correct arrangement of the Vedic texts as traditionally handed down. The Veda is principally concerned

with sacrifices, though now and then there are rules addressed to men for regulating conduct only. People would only study the Vedic sentences contained in the smṛtis ( that are concerned principally with conduct) where they would be arranged in a different order according to subjects and there would thus be loss of the arrangement of the Veda as originally delivered. Visvarupa 1618 (on Yaj. I. 7) quotes the above verse of Kumarila and states that there are thousands of smrti rules that have their source in the Veda; he and Kumarila instance tha rules against talking with (or coming in contact with ) a woman in her monthly illness or the rule against assaulting a brāhmaṇa, or the rule about the sin of killing an ātreyi woman &c. Medhātithi on Manu II. 6 has an elaborate discussion on this very topic and quotes several verses from his own work called Smrtiviveka 1619. He does not approve of the first two views and follows Kumārila's view. Mimāmgā writers and commentators like Medhātithi say that Manu and other authors of smstis brought together for easy comprehension matters that are scattered about in the various Vedic texts, that are either not known to the students of the several sākhās or that cannot be brought together by men of ordinary or weak intellect, 16194 

The general proposition that sniștis are authoritative being established, a further question arises. What is to happen if a empti rule conflicts with the rule of the Veda? Jaimini deals

with this question in I. 3. 3-4, 1620 which form a topic that states an exception to the general rule contained in Jai. 1.3.1-2. Sabara gives three instances where there is apparently a conflict between the prescriptions of the śruti and those of smṛtis. The Veda says, 'the priest should chant (the slotra) after touching the audumbari post', while smrti says 'the whole of the audum bart post should be covered with cloth'. The Veda says 'one to whom a gon has been born and whose hair is still dark (and has not turned grey ) should consecrate the Vedic fires', while smrti says 'a man should observe Vedic studenthood for 48 years' 1621 ; the Veda says 'when the Agniṣoiniya rite is finished then one may eat (the food prepared) in the house of the sacrificer, while smṛti says 'the food of one who has undergone dikṣā for a sacrifice may be eaten after he purchases the soma plant'. In these cases the proposition enunciated by Jaimini is that in case of conflict ( between an express sruti rule and a smrti rule) the smrti rule should be discarded, for when there is no conflict ( with an express sruti) inference may be made ( that a smrti rule is based upon some Vedic text).' The examples may be explained as follows: The 'audumbari' is a post of udumbara planted in the sudas in the performance of the Agnistoma ; the stotras (other than Bahispavamāna) are chanted near the audumbari post in the sadas. Vide H. of Dh. vol. II. p. 1155 for the fixing of the audumbara post in the sadas and p. 1185 for the chanting of stotras near the audumbari. If the whole of the post be covered with cloth, it would not be possible to touch the post, but only the cloth would be touched. So there is contra diction. If a man is to consecrate Vedic fires when he has a son and his hair is dark, he must be between about 20 and 40 (i. e. a young man), but if a man were to observe brahmacarya for

48 years, he would be about 52 to 56 years of age before he married ( as the upanayana of a brāhmaṇa was to be performed generally in the 8th year or from the 5th year onwards at the most). Only a married man could consecrate Vedic fires. But a man's hair when he is fiftytwo years of age or more can hardly be all dark. Therefore there is contradiction between the rule derived from the Veda and that derived from smrti. In the Jyotiptoma (which generally occupied five days), the dikṣā (purification and initiation of the sacrificer) takes place on the first day in the afternoon (vide H. of Dh. vol. II. pp. 1134-1136 ). Soma is purchased on the 2nd day of the Jyoti stoma (ibid. 1140–4 ) and the animal is sacrificed for Agni and Soma on the 4th day (ibid. pp. 1158-59). According to śruti therefore the food prepared in the house of a diksita may be eaten only after the 4th day, while smrti says that it may be eaten after the purchase of soma on the 2nd day. In this way there is contradiction. Kumārila 1622 does not agree with Sabara as regards these examples in particular and as regards the general attitude towards smstis that are accepted by Vedic followers. He makes great efforts to explain how there is no real conflict in the cases cited by Sabara. As regards the cloth covering the audumbari he says that it may cover the bottom and the upper portion of the post and leave a space of two or three finger-breadths in the middle uncovered ( so that the audumbari post can be touched in that particular por tion), that (p. 188 ) there is a passage in the Sātyāyani 

1622. The sūtra (Jai. 1. 3, 3 ) is read as n or water and with both readings it has been explained in different ways from ancient times.

Brahmana which refers to the cloth covering the audumbari (and so there may at most be an option), that as regards the taking of food in the house of a dikṣita after the purchase of soma there is a śruti passage in the Atharvavoda (pp. 181 and 189 ) similar to the smrti passage ( and thus there is no conflict between śruti and smrti, but between śruti and śruti, which would lead to an option) and further the smrti rule may apply in the case of a man in distress (ūpad dluermu), that smrti does not prescribe an absolute period of 48 years for the study of Veda, but Baud. Dh. S. itself allows several alternative or optional periods and so no question of conflict with śruti arises. Kumārila's own position is this: In the case of apparent conflicts between sruti and smṛti, various methods of interpretation and reconciliation are possible. Each of the two may be given its proper scope as referring to different subject matters ( which is called viṣayız-vyavasthā); it is also possible to hold that smrti is based on some sruti texts already existing but not found at the time of discussion, but which may ultimately be found, in which case there will be an option, though the latter is to be avoided as far as possible as it is liable to eight faults (vide Tantravārtika pp. 174-175 ); or the two may be reconciled even when referring to the same subject matter e. g. a man may have dark hair even when he is 52 or more and the smști may be taken as meant to refer to such a man, while the sruti states the general rule about the age when consecration of Vedic fires was to be made. Therefore Kumārila holds that all that is meant by Jaimnini and even by Sabara is that there is a great distinction between sruti and smrti in that the former is apauruṣeya and an independent authority, while the latter has a human author (liable to err ), is either actually based on the Veda or is inferred to be so based, that the two therefore can never be said to be quite alike each other as regards their authoritativeness and that lastly smrti is not in itself to be regarded as unauthoritative 1623. Kumārila therefore suggests that the proper subject of discussion in Jai. I. 3. 3-4 is the works of Bauddhas, Saṅkhya, Yoga, Pañcarātra, Pāśupata and other heretical sects and the practices of mlecchas. These works contain some matters such as the emphasis on ahimsā, truthfulness, restraint of senses, charity and compassion, which are also emphasized in the Veda, but those works are not

Worlds of heretical sects

generally accepted by the followers of the Veda, are based on specious and false reasoning only (they are haitukas in the words of Manu), that they deny the authority of the Veda. Therefore Jaimini means that these works of heretic sects are not authoritative in matters of dharma as they are opposed to the Veda and should be discarded. For want of space it is not possible to set out in detail the interesting discussion in the Tantravārtika. The Jaiminiya-nyāya-mālāvistāra also gives another explanation of Jai. I. 3. 3. 

Sabara (on Jai. I. 3. 4) explains that the three smrti passages stated above are not authoritative since it is possible to point out how they originated in a visible worldly motive such as greed. When a visible motive can be pointed out for any smrti text, it is not proper to infer that it is based on the Veda and has an unseen spiritual motive. Sabara 1624 postulates the reasons in the way of a modern man finding fault with priests, Some priests covered the whole of the Auduinbari post with cloth, because they coveted the cloth as part of the fee; others who desired a free meal when hungry took food at the house of a dikṣita even after he had purchased the Soma plant; certain others in order to conceal their absence of virility went in for Veda study for 48 years. The Tantravārtika tries to show that in all these cases there is really no visible motive such as covetousness ( pp. 188-189 ). 

Sabara gives an alternative explanation of this sutra (Jai. 1.3.4) and makes a separate topic (adhikarana) of it. The reasong 1625 for giving an alternative explanation of a sūlra or adhikarana are two, viz. dissatisfaction with the explanation already given or the wide scope of the subject under discussion. In 1. 3.3 passages from smrtis were cited which were apparently in conflict with śruti. If they were really in conflict, that one reason alone is more than sufficient to render the smṛtis invalid. Therefore to say further that those snirti passages originate in worldly motives like greed does not add any very substantial reason for the abandonment of smrtis as authoritative. There fore Sabara makes another adhikarapa of sutra 4 of Jai. 1. 3.

He cites gmpti passages which are not opposed to Veda at all and says that such passages have seen a worldly motive such as convetousness and it is not proper to suppose that they are based on Veda and are therefore authoritative, when a visible purpose or motive can be ascribed to them. The result of the explanations of I. 3. 3-4 given by Sabara would be that smrti rules that are opposed to śruti rules and smrti prescriptions that can be shown to have a clear worldly motive are not authoritative or absolutely binding, while the rest of smsti texts are authoritative. 1628 

Sabara cites on Jai. I. 3. 4 (when taken as a separate topic ) 16264 two examples; (1) the adhvaryu priest takes ( as his fee ) the cloth used in the Vaisarjana homa; (2) they perform the gift of the elephant ( i. a. the cloth covering) of the sacrificial post. Sabara says that these passages are not opposed to any śruti text but instead of inferring a Vedic text as their basis it is far better to hold that there is a manifest worldly motive for these rules ( viz. covetousness of the adhvaryu ) and so these smrti passages need not be looked upon as authorita tive. 1627 

This discussion raises an important doctrine which frequ ently figures in dharmaśāstra works. The doctrine is expressed

Rules having a visible purpose 

837 

in this form viz. when a visible motive or purpose is obvious in the case of a rule or prescription it is not proper to ascribe an unseen or spiritual purpose or reason for it. This doctrine is older than even Ap. Dh. S. I. 4. 12. 11 which says, 'where men act because they find pleasure in so doing, there śāstra has no scope'. Sabara also says, 1628 'those rules (in the smrti) that have a seen purpose derive their authority from that fact, while those that have no visible purpose may be inferred to be based upon the Voda (and derive their authority from that).' These words of Sabara are quoted by Kullūka on Manu III. 7 where Manu states that a girl should not be selected as a bride from a family that neglects the sanskāras, in which no male children are born, in which there is no Veda study, the members of which have on their bodies long and thick hair, that suffers from such diseases as piles, dyspepsia, epilepsy, black and white leprosy. Kullūka remarks that the works on medicine hold that such diseases are inherited and so if such a girl be married the progeny might suffer from those diseases, and thus this prohibition is based on a visible motive. From this a very important conclusion is drawn by dharmaśāstra writers viz. if one while performing a rite or when engaged in any matter acts contrary to a rule that has a seen purpose, the rite or matter does not become invalid or void, while where a rule is based on an unseen or spiritual purpose and it is infringed, the act itself becomes void or invalid. Yāj, I. 52 and 53 1629 prescribe among other things that the bride to be chosen by a man must be free from ( incur able ) diseases, must have a brother living, must not be a sapinda of the bridegroom or must not have the same gotra or pravra as that of the bridegroom. On this the Mit. remarks that if a man marries a girl who is suffering from an incurable disease, the marriage is valid, only he does an act which runs counter to seen results (i, e. he may suffer the consequence that

his children may be diseased ), but if he goes through a oere mony of marriage with a girl who is a gapiṇda or of the same gotra or prayara there is no valid marriage and the girl is not his legal wife. No clear visible purpose can be associated with the prohibition against marrying a sapiṇda or sagotra girl; hence there must be a spiritual purpose in that prohibition and 80 if one infringes it the act itself (viz. marriage) becomes void, 1630 

The Tantravārtika of Kumārila has as usual a very long note on this discussion. He does not see eye to eye with Sabara. He says 1631 that the Mimāṁsā is concerned with the investiga tion of dharma, that śruti is the prime authority in matters of dharma, that Mimāṁsā has concern with smrtis only so far as their authoritativeness in matters of dharma goes, that just as agriculture and the like are not discussed in Mimāṁsā works because they have a purely secular purpose, •80 all acts that men do for a visible worldly purpose have no bearing on the investigation of dharma and that therefore the bhāsyakāra (Sabara ) was not quite right in saying that such practices as rising to receive an old man or a teacher have a visible purpose and are authoritative on that ground. He further remarks that visible and invisible or spiritual purposes are often inextricably mixed up. When the Veda prescribes 'he pounds the grains of paddy' or enjoins a sacrifice like the Kārlri for bringing down rain, there is a visible purpose therein (0.g. the rice grains have to be freed from husk before boiled rice for obla tions can be prepared ). So even when an act has a seen purpose it may still have Veda as the basis ; so also an act such as rising to show respect to a teacher may have a seen result ( such as the teacher being pleased teaches the pupils with enthusiasm ) as well as an unseen result (viz. completion of Veda study without obstacles ). Therefore he argues that all

Authority of smslis depends on purpose 

839 

smrtis 1632 are authoritative according to the purpose they serve, that whatever portion of the smrtis is concerned with dharma and mokṣa ( final release from samsāra ) has its origin in the Veda and whatever is concerned with wealth and the satisfaction of desires (artha and kūna ) is based on worldly practices. In this way are to be explained the didactic portions of the Maha bhārata and the Purānas, the episodes in these being useful as urthavādus' (eulogies of what are prescribed as religious duties), the description of the several divisions of the earth being useful for indicating what countries are suitable for the per formance of dharma and the enjoyment of its rewards and being based partly on Veda and partly on direct experience. Similarly the auxiliary lores (angıs) of the Veda (such as phonetics, grammar, metrics &c.) are partly based on the Veda and partly on worldly experience. Mimāṁsa and Nyāya (logic) are necessary for the correct interpretation and understanding of the Veda ( as stated by Manu in XII. 105-106). He is even prepared to concede that systems 1633 like the Sāökhya ( which postulates a prime cause of the world called Pradhāna) or Vedānta ( which postulates Puruṣa as the cause of the world ), the theory of atoms ( propounded by Kanāda ) serve the purpose of explaining the creation and dissolution of the world, lead one to understand how the performance of sacrifices gives rise to the subtle apūrva which leads on to heaven and also exemplify how human effort and fate have their own spheres of operation (i. e. without human effort the world is produced and in spite of human effort it may be dissolved ). Kumārila goes a step further and states that even the Buddhist philosophies of vijnāna ( cognitions being the only reality ), of the non-exis tence of the soul or of eternal flux arise from the arthavada

He winds up by saying that in the case of all knowledge or works wherever the result (or reward) of the course laid down in them is to take place in the future and there is no possibility of experiencing its happening in the present such work may be deemed to be based on the Veda; but where, as in the science of medicine, the result can be seen taking place in other people, that know ledge is authoritative only because of the visible result. 

This discussion about smrtis based on the Veda or on perceptible purposes or motives is taken up in the digests on dharmaśāstra. For example, Aparārka 1634 (pp. 626-627 ) quotes long passages from the Bhavisyapurāṇa dividing the contents of smṛtis into five categories and exemplifying that division, viz. (1) those based on a visible purpose or motive, (2) those based on unseen or spiritual motives or purposes, (3) those based on both visible purposes and unseen or spiritual purposes, (4) those based on reasoning, (5) those that merely re-iterate what is already well-known or determined. All these except the first variety are based according to the Bhavisyapurana on the Veda. The examples of the five kinds given by the same Purāna are respectively as follows: (1) the smrti (viz. Arthaśāstra or Dandaniti) in which there is a discussion about six gupas (sandhi &c.), the four upāyas (sāma, dāna &c.), the various superintendents of state departments (adlıyakṣa) and of kantakas; (2) the prescription that one should perform the sandhyū worship or that one should not partake of dog's flesh; (3) a brahmacūrin

Up. III. 5.1 (vyutthāyātha bhiksācaryam caranti) or Jābāla Up. 4. 

In I. 3. 5-7 Jaimini as interpreted by Sabara 1635 deals with the topic of the authoritativeness of certain usages laid down in the smṛtis in relation to Vedic rites. Sabara states : śiṣtan say that religious rites should be performed after sipping water (i. e. after ācamana), one should wear the sacred thread in the upavita way in the worship of gods, one should do with the right hand all religious acts. The question is whether these aots should be done if not opposed to the sruti or should not be performed if opposed to what is taught in the Veda. The pūria pakṣıı view is that these acts should not be done because they run counter to the sequence of the acts laid down in the Veda. For example, the Veda says, 'after getting ready a bundle (or handful ) of kusa grass called veda one should prepare the redi (altar)'. Here the preparation of the vedi is declared to follow immediately after the getting ready of a liandful of kuśas. If after the handful is got ready a man has a sneeze he has accord ing to Manu V. 145 and Vas. III. 38 to sip water before going on with the preparation of the vedi. This would be against the sequence ( krama) of acts laid down in the Veda. Strangely enough Mr. K.L. Sarkar in T.L.L. (on Mimāmsā rules) translater the words 'vedam krtvā vedim karoti' as 'make the vedi and

then recite the vedas '(p. 241), thereby committing two mistakes He misunderstands the word 'veda' which in this passage only means a 'liandful of kuśas' and inverts the sequence of the acts denoted by the gerundial termination 'tvā'. On account of these two mistakes the discussion on pp. 240-242 is mislead ing and obscure. If a man were to do the things required in a vedic rite with both hands, he would be able to do them quickly. The smrti rule that every religious act should be done with the right hand alone interferes with the quick performance of religious acts. The established conclusion is that these religi ous acts (such as acaniana ) are performed by the sistas, are prompted by no visible motive ( such as covetousness ) and are therefore to be looked upon as authoritative, being not opposed to sruti. Kumārila does not like this way of explaining the gūtras, since the instances given by Sabara really do not deserve to be put forth as even prima facie opposed to Sruti. The Tantra vārtika (p. 201) sets out sruti pagaages wherein the wearing of the sacred thread in the upavita forin2636 (Tai. S. II. 5. 11. 1 and Tai. Ār. II. 1), acamana (Tai. Ā.. II. 11 ), are enjoined. Therefore it explains the sūtras in a different way. It splits up Jai. I. 3.5-7 into two adhikaraṇas. The first two constitute one topic. The pūrvapakṣa 1637 is : those precepts of Buddha and other founders of sects, such as the construction of monasteries and parks, the insistence on desirelessness, the practice of meditation, ahiṁsā, truthfulness, restraint of senses, charity and kindness, are such that they are also laid down by the Veda, are not opposed to the ideas of sistas or do not run counter to nor rouge those who know the Veda to anger and therefore they must be held to be authoritative. This is denied by saying that the Bauddha doctrines even on the abovesaid matters are not to

Authority of Bauddha doctrines about ahinsa &c.

be accepted as authoritative since only a limited 1638 number ( 14 or 18 ) of vidyās (the four vedas, the upavedas, the angas of the voda, the 18 smstis, purānas, Dandaniti) have been accepted by the vedic śistas as authoritative on matters of dharma and the works of the Bauddhas and Jainas are not included therein. Just as milk though originally pure becomes useless and unreliable when put into a bag of dog-skin, so the doctrines of Bauddhas such as ahimsā, though based on truth, are useless and are not authoritative in themselves for the followers of the Veda. 

The Tantravārtika holds that Jai. I. 3.7 is an adhikarana by itself and is concerned with the authoritativeness of sadācāra (the customs and usages of śistas ). Its position is that those usages are authoritative that are not opposed to express Vedic texts, that are practised by Vedic sistas under the belief that they are riglit conduct (dharına ) and for which no visible motive ( such as pleasure or the satisfaction of desires or the acquisition of wealth ) can be predicated. Sistas are those who perform the religious acts expressly enjoined by the Veda. They are not so called because they practise what is said to be sadācāra ; otherwise there will be an argument in a circle (in the form 'sadācāra means what is practised by śiṣtas and sistas are those who practise sadācāra'). The practices traditionally handed down from generation to generation which are observed by sistas ( as stated above ) with the idea that they constitute a part of dharma must be regarded as dharma and as leading to heaven. 1639 Practices do not become authoritative by the mere fact that no such motive or purpose can be postulated for them, but they become so only when they are observed by śiṣtas as

The Tantravārtika (p. 205 ) gives certain illustrations of such practices viz gifts, japa, mātryajña (offerings to the mother Goddesses ), the festival of Indra's banner, fairs held at temples, fasts by maidens on the 4th day of a month, gifts of lamps on the first day of Kārtika, the Apring 1640 festival on the first day of the dark half of Phālguna &c. The Tantravārtika is careful to point out that many activities such as agriculture, menial service or trade that are the means of securing wealth and pleasures and that give rise to several fixed and varying acts and also such actions as eating sumptuous food, drinking, sleeping on soft beds, possessing a charming house and garden, engaging in painting, singing and dancing, enjoying the fragrance of sandalwood and flowers, all of which are common to inlecchas and Aryas, are not deemed by any one to be part of dharma and that it does not follow that, because a few actions (of sigtas) are accepted as dharma, all their actions are to be looked upon as dharma.1641 In ordinary life certain practices only are deemed to be siṣtācāra, while there are certain other acts that are common to all human beings (including śiṣtas ), but are not so regarded. Certain practices such as worship of gods and honouring brāhmaṇas are Been to be common among all people and yet do constitute dharma, because that is deemed to be so by the sistas. Those practices alone are dharma that are observed by sistas only as obligatory on thein and not other practices that are common to all beings. The Trantravārtika then refers to the Dharma

Ancient transgressions of dharma 

845 

sūtra 1642 of Gaut. ( 1.3 ) and Ap. Dh. S. (II. 6. 13.7-8) which say that ancient (or great) men in several instances were guilty of transgressions of dharma and of committing desperate acts, that on account of their spiritual merit they did not incur sin but if a man of later days were to follow them in the same acts he would sink into hell. It then gives twelve instances of lapses from good conduct (attributed even to avuārs ) that were trang grossions and either explains them away or says that they were due to wrath, hatred or other passions, were not intended by the authors ( of those acts ) themselves to be dharma and are not to be looked upon as śiṣtācāra by modern men. The instances are: (1) Prajāpati who is said to have approached Uṣas, his daughter (Sat. Br. I. 7. 4. 1 or Ait. Br. 13. 9); (2) Indra, who is described as the paramour of Ahalyā ( in the Subrahmanya litany ); (3) Nahuṣa, who occupied the position of Indra, made approaches to Saci, the wife of Indra (Udyoga, chap. 13 ff) and was transformed into an jagura (Boa Constrictor);(4) Vasiṣtha, who when his 100 sons were devoured by a demon, was so struck with grief that he threw himself bound into the Vipāśā river(Nirukta IX.26, Adiparva chap. 177.1-6=cr. ed. 167. 1-6, Vanaparva 130. 8-9, Anuśāsana 3. 12-13); (5) Purūravas who thought of dying by hanging or by being devoured by wolves (Rg. X. 95. 14, Sat. Br. XI. 5. 1-8) when separated from Urvasi; (6) Viśvāmitra, who officiated as priest at the sacrifice of Trisanku that had become a cāndala through a curse ( Adiparva 71. 31-33);(7) Yudhisthira who took Draupadi as wife although she had been won by his younger brother Arjuna by his skill in archery and who prevaricated in order to bring about the death of his brāhmaṇa teacher Drona (Dronaparva 190. 55); (8) Kropa Dvaipāyana. (Vyāsa), wbo thought himself a perpetual student, procreated by niyoga at the request of his mother Satyavati two sons on the widows of his brother Vicitravīrya; (9) Bhiṣma who lived on without be longing to any ( of the four ) aśramas and who is said to have performed several Aśramedhas though he had no wife; (10)

Rāma who performed Asyamedha accompanied by a golden image of Sitā ; (11) Dhṛtarāstra, though blind, performed sacri fices; (12) Vāsudeva and Arjuna are described as being drunk and as having married Rukmini and Subhadrā respectively who were their maternal uncle's daughters (such marriages being forbidden). Kumārila, like a modern comparative mythologist, explains (Tantravārtika p. 208 ) that Prajapati means 'the Sun' who approaches (i. e. rises after ) the Dawn. This explanation is as old as the Ait. Br. 13. 9 where it is said that there are two views viz. it is either Heaven' or 'Uṣas' that is meant by the word 'daughter. Similarly Indra and Ahalyā respectively mean the Sun and the Night and jāra means literally one who makes to disappear or wither away' (and not paramour) in that passage. Vide H. of Dh. vol. II. p. 1145 note 2550 for the epi thet. Ahalyāyai jāra' in the Veda and quotation from Tantra vārtika. The story of Ahalya and Indra varies in its details in the epics. Vide Rāmāyana I. 48, Udyoga 12. 6. These two are instances of transgression of dharma (dharma-vyatikrama) and the next case of Vasiṣtha is an example of sāhasa (through sorrow ). Kumārila says that Viśvāmitra was prompted by his hatred of Vasistha and his pride, that the sin accruing from his act would be neutralized by his great austerities. So his actions cannot serve as a model for imitation by others. Vyāsa, who was a son of Satyavati from Parāśara when she was a maiden, had Vicitravirya as (his uterine ) brother after Satya vati married Santanu. In the case of a brahmacārin, sexual intercourse is most reprehensible ( vide H. of Dh, vol. II. p. 374) But Vyāsa agreed to niyoga because of his regard for his mothe as allowed by Gaut. 18. 4-5. Kumārila adds that Vyāsa could do so on account of his great past and future austerities, that another person with similar qualifications may do so even in spite of all prohibitions, since the Mahābhārata ( Aśramavāsika 30. 24) says 'sarvam balavatāṁ pathyam' (to the strong every thing is wholesome or allowable). He gives an apt illustration. An elephant can devour branches of trees without harm, but others doing so would meet death. Dakṣa V.10 prescribes 'anāśra. ml na tiṣtheta kṣanamekamapi dvijaḥ' (a twice-born person should not stay even for a moment unattached to some āśrama), Bhisma remained unmarried out of filial devotion to his father and Rāma could not think of another wife as he was so much attached to Sitā. Kumārila boldly asserts that Bhisma hada wife only for the purpose of the sacrifices he performed (though this is mentioned in no Itibāsa or Purāṇa ) and relies upon the

mode of proof called arthāpotti for this 1643. His words are given below. This and some other explanations offered by Kumārila shed a very interesting light on the theological apologetics of Mimāmsakas. Vide H. of Dh. vol. II. pp. 558 and 684 for Rāma and the golden image of Sitā. As to Yudhisthira's bringing about the death of his brābmana teacher the explanation is that the former performed Aśvamedha after the end of the war by way of prayascitta ( vide H. of Dh. vol. II. p. 147 11. 333 and pp. 1236-37 notes 2674-75 for Aśvamedha as the re mover of all sins). As to Draupadi being the wife of five brothers Kumārila quotes Adiparva 198. 14 ( =cr. ed. 190. 14) and offers several explana tions (p. 209 ), the most astounding being that there were five wives of the five brothers who were so similar that they were all referred to as one. As the Nyāyasudhā (p. 194 ) remarks, these various explanations were offered to show off great re sourcefulness of interpretation (paribāra-vaibhayārtham), the proper one being that the practice of the Pandavas was an evil one and was not to be imitated. A blind man could not perform sacrifices and was excluded from inheritance. Vide H. of Dh. vol. II. p. 157 n. 369 and vol. III. p. 609 n. 1154. But Kumārila says that as Dhstarāstra was blessed with sight for a while and saw his deceased sons through the miraculous power of Vyāsa ( Aśramavāsiparva chap. 32-37 ) he might have been endowed with sight at the time of the sacrifices or what is meant is that he made gifts which are spoken of as sacrifices. As regards Subhadrā, Kumārila asserts that in spite of the fact that Subhadra was said in the Adiparva ( 219,18 = cr. ed. 211. 18 ) to have been the daughter of, Vasudeva and sister of Krsna, she was really the daughter of Krspa's step-mother's sister or the daughter's daughter of the sister of his step-mother's father (a female cousin being often called a sister among the Lātas ). Vide H. of Dh. vol. II. pp. 459-460 and notes to my edition of the text of V. Mayūkba ( pp. 200-202 ). Krsna's marriage with Rukmini is to be similarly explaind. It is somewhat surpris

ing that Khapdadeva states that it is nowhere found that Subhadrā was the daughter of Vasudeva. Probably he had a corrupt reading of the Mahabharata passage before him. As to the charge of drinking spirituous liquor (ubhau madhvāsa vakṣibau in Udyogaparva 59. 5) against both Vāsudeva and Arjuna, they were both ksatriyas and only brāhmaṇas were prohibited from drinking any kind of intoxicating drink (Gaut. II. 25), while to kṣatriyas and vaiśyas two kinds of wine called madhu ( liquor from honey or madhuka flowers) and sidhu (rum ) were allowed and only paiṣti ( spirituous liquor distilled from flour) was forbidden (by Gaut. II, 25, Manu XI. 93-94). 

Kumārila offers some other explanations of Jai.1644 I. 3. 5-7 which need not be set out here. 

Kumārila mentions certain practices of his times and concludes that they are to be condemned and not to be followed or regarded as authoritative. He says: 1645 even in these days brahmana women of Ahicchatra and Mathurā drink wine ; northerners ( northern brāhmaṇas ) engage in such transactions as the gift and sale of horses and mules that have a mano, asses,

camels and animals with two rows of teeth and eat from the same plate with their wives, children and friends; brāhmaṇas of the south enter into matrimony with the naternal uncle's daughter and take their meals while seated on a couch (of wicker work); both ( brāhmaṇas of the north and south ) tako cooked food ( kept in pots ) that remains after their friends or relatives have partaken of it or that has been touched by them. ( at the time of eating); they chew betelnut leaves that have been touched by persons of all varṇas, do not perform sipping of water (ācamana ) at the end of the chewing of betelnut, wear clothes washed by washermen and brought on the back of asses; they do not avoid contact even with persons guilty of grave sins (except of brāhmaṇa murder). There are everywhere an infinite number of very obvious transgressions of the subtle dictates of dharma laid down for each man, caste or family, that (transgressions ) are contrary to śruti, smrti and each other and that have a visible purpose behind them. It is not possible to regard such practices as authoritative.' Similarly Varadarāja, (1600-1660 A. D.) a pupil of Bhattoji Diksita, in his work styled the Gīrvānapadamañjari in a dialogue between a Kānyakubja brāhmaṇa and a sannyāsin hailing from Vijayanagara makes the brāhmaṇa host say that each country has certain practices which are durācāras such as marrying a maternal uncle's daughter in the south, marriage of girls among southerners even before they are four years old, sitting down to a meal without bathing in Karnātaka, in Mahārāstra the marriage of a younger brother before an elder one, in the hilly country the practice of niyoga (vide Mr. P. K. Gode's interesting paper in 'Bharatiya-vidya' vol. VI pp. 27-30). 

According to Sabara, Jaimini in I. 3. 8-9 deals with certain words like yava, varāha and vetasa, that have different signi ficances among Aryas and Mlecchas ( and therefore these sūtras constitute what is called yavavarāhādhikarana). But Kumārila does not like this view of Sabara and proposes another topic for these two sutras, viz. the relative strength of smrti and sadācāra where they are in conflict. Here there are three 1646 possible

views, viz. that both are equally strong and so there is an option in case of conflict, that ācāra is stronger, that smrti is the stronger of the two. The prima facie view is that both are equally strong, since smrti and sadācāra are both inferred to be based upon Veda. Kumārila's own final conclusion is that smrti is of greater force than ācāra, that is, where they come in direct conflict smṛti sliould prevail. His position is that, though both smrti and acāra are to be deemed to be based on Veda, there is a difference between the two. People have full faith in such smrtis as that of Manu and Manu and others are believed to have been inspired sages and are the propounders of the rules of dharma scattered about in various Vedic sākhās, while the same cannot be said about modern men and their practicos cannot claim or possess the same weight and allegiance that the practices laid down by Manu and other sages can From the practice of sistas one may infer a smrti as the root thereof and then further one may infer a śruti as the root of the smrti. Therefore acāra is removed by two stages from the Veda, while smrti is removed only by one stage from the Veda. Hence Kumārila says that in case of conflict smrti should prevail over &cāra. The practices that are discussed here ( acc. to Kumārila, Parthasarathi and others ) are such as the marriage with a maternal uncle's daughter or with a paternal aunt's daughter and the like that are in vogue among certain people and that are yet opposed to emstis (such as Manu XI, 171-72 ) and for which a visible motive can easily be found (kāmādihetvuntaran spasta meva drtyate, as the Sāstradipikā says) 

Kumārila gives another (and so a third ) explanation of Jai. I. 3, 8-9 1647 which need not detain us here.

Holākādhikarana 

851 

Jai. I. 3. 15-23 constitute what is called Holākadhikarana, or Samānyaśrutikalpanādhikarana. The first two and the last two gūtras are the most important. Certain practices 1648 like the Holaka (spring) festival are observed by the easterners, certain others like Åbninaibuka (worship of growing Karanja or Arka or other trees as handed down in one's family ) by the southerners, and the Udvrsabhayajña (honouring oxen on the Full Moon of Jyestha and making them run a race) by the nor therners. The question is: whether, in making an inference about these practices being based on Veda, one was to suppose that the inferred Vedic text also should be restricted to the easter ners and the like 1649. The pūrvapakṣa view is that the śruti to be inferred as the basis of the respective practices must be deemed to be restricted to certain persons only (such as the easterners i. e. pracyas &c.). The established conclusion is that 

(Continued from the last page) should not be gifted on account of the prohibition contained in 'he does not give kesarin': एष हि विशेषोश्चानामग्येभ्यो द्रव्येभ्यो यदेषां दानं प्रतिषिध्यते न केसरिणो दधाति नोभयतोदतः प्रतिगृहातीति विश्वजित्येव समाम्नायते. The मीमांसाको.

such practices must be deemed to be meant for all, since the general rule about vedic injunctions is that they are applicable to all. The performer specially meant by each Vedic injunction is known in either of three ways, 1650 viz. by capability, by non prohibition and by the employment of a special epithet or attribute. When it is said 'svargakāmo yajeta' then only the three twice-born classes are meant, for, they alone are capable of tending the sacred fires and of possessing Vedic learning and a śūdra is not a fit person to whom that injunction can apply. Those who are guilty of grave sins (patita) and the impotent are prohibited from performing Vedic rites. When the Veda says ' rājā rājusūyena yajeta' there is a special attribute of the performer ( viz. being a ksatriya ) prescribed by the śruti and so no one else can perform Rājasūya. When none of these three exists a Vedic vidhi is in general meant for all (sarvadharma). The practices of Holākā, Vrṣabhayajña and the like should not be held to be restricted to certain countries or people only, but should be inferred to be applicable to all. When a man leaves the east and goes to the south, he may still perform the Holākā festival; while a man from the eastern country itself may not perform it at all. Further the words 'southern, eastern and northern' are relative. A country that is called southern may be to the north of another. Therefore Holākā and other practices are not invariably concomitant with particular countries or peoples. Nor can it be said that those practices require those particular countries for their performance in the way in which Sruti expressly requires the Vaiśvadeva rito ( one of the four cāturmāsyas ) to be performed on a spot that slopes towards the east. The Tantravārtika 1651 points out that persons receive appellations from names of countries on various grounds as being born in a country or as residing therein or as coming from that country or as going to that country. Medhatithi ,on Manu VIII. 46 says the same.

Authorituliveness of GȚhya and Dharma sutras 

853 

The Tantravārtika explains that the first two gūtras are meant to refer to another question also, viz. whether the rules of the grhyasutras 1652 and of such dharmasutra works as the sātra of Gautama are authoritative only as to certain groups or are meant to be authoritative for all. He begins by saying that the Puranas, the Manusmrti and Itihāsa ( i. e. the Mahabharata) are equally authoritative for all people and then points out that the Gobhila-gļhya and Gautama-dharmasutra are traditionally accepted by the students of the Sāmaveda, that the dharmasutra of Vasistha is accepted by the students of the Rgveda, the sūtra of Saṅkha-Likhita by the followers of the white Yajurveda and the sūtras of Apastamba and Baudhāyana by the followers of the Taittirfya Sakhā. The Śāstradipikā explains that an author who was a student of the Samaveda taught his own work to his pupils who also learned the Sāmaveda under him, that these pupils in their turn taught that work to others and in that way there arose a tradition among the students of the Sāmaveda to study the sūtra of Gautama. Therefore, to say even as to gļhyā works that they are restricted to particular groups of persons is not correct. Similarly in the case of practices there is no epithet or attribute that is common to all those who practise them or which distinguishes those who do not observe them from those that observe them and therefore it is not possible to restrict such practices as Holākā to particular countries or groups of people. 

The requisites of valid customs ag laid down by the emi. nent writers of the Purva-mimamsa school may now be suin marised. Such customs must be ancient, must not be opposed to the express texts of the Veda or of sinsti, must be such as to be regarded as obligatory by the sistas and must be observed

by them with the consciousness that they are so, they must not have a seen or visible purpose, and they must not be im moral 1653. It has to be remembered that the pūrvamimāmsā writers did not lay down anything about the binding character of usages that were peculiarly secular but restricted their remarks to customs and usages that had more or less an unseen or spiritual purpose. Khandadeva emphasizes this by stating *only those customs can be deemed to be based on the Veda that are not opposed to the Veda and smṛtis and that are obser ved by respectable people under the belief that thereby they are carrying what dharma dictates '1653. Medhātithi on Manu 1655 II. 18 makes this position quite clear after quoting a verse of Kumārila'a smṛti that is opposed to the Veda or is self-contra dictory, or has a visible secular purpose or expressly states a motive (for observing its precepts) cannot be deemed to be based on the Veda'. The Mimāmsā-kaustubha (p. 51 on Jai. I. 3.7) quotes a verse to the effects that only those whose ancestors also observed certain usages handed down from gene ration to generation would not incur blame by observing them (if they are opposed to śruti or smrti), but not others ( who

## 33 Customs and Dharmaśāstra Works

CHAPTER XXXIII 

CUSTOMS AND DHARMASASTRA WORKS 

It is now necessary to see how Dharmaśāstra works have dealt with the authority and binding force of customs and usages. Sadācāra is defined by Harita as follows 1657:- the word 'sat' means 'good' and the good are those who are free from (inoral) taint; the practices of such people are called sadācāra. Vide Manu II. 18, which also defines sadācāra. Even the most ancient sūtras testify to the fact that numerous customs and usages had arisen in different countries and vil lages. The Aśv. gr. (1. 7.1-2) says, 1658 various indeed are the observances of ( different ) countries and villages; one should follow those in marriages; what, however, is common (to all or most ) shall be declared by us'. The Ap. gr. (II. 15) declares, * people should understand from women what procedure is to be observed (according to custom)' and the Ap. Dh. S. provides (1. 7. 20. 8 = II. 11. 29. 14 ) that one 1659 should regulate one's course of action ( in difficult or doubtful matters ) according to the conduct which is unanimously approved of in all countries by the Āryas (men of the three higher castes ), who have been properly disciplined, who are aged, who have restrained their senses and who are neither covetous nor hypocritical and con cludes with the aphorism (II. 11. 29. 15 ) 'some teachers hold that the rest of the dharmas (not set out in this work ) may be understood from women and from men of all castes'. Baud. Dh. S. 1660 (1. 5. 13) states (on the subject of śrāddha) 'the us. ages of people should be followed as to other rites to be per formed'. Several gļhyasūtras (like Pāraskara II. 17, Mānava

gr. I. 4.6) refer to the practices of people that should be followed in such matters as commencing agricultural operations, holi days &c. It is needless to set out these in detail here. Manu1661 IV, 178 pronounces the general prescription for all men, 'one should walk in the path of good men which their fathers and grandfathers trod; by so doing one will come to no harm'. For ordinary men this procedure is easy to understand and to follow. This dictum sets a premium on the attitude of no change in any matter for fear that change may lead to some unexpected harm and has been throughout the ages up to the present the inotto of most people in India. As ācara or sadācāra is tangible and requires no effort to decide between conflicting views, we find eulogies of it in the earliest smrtis and purāṇas. Vide Manu IV. 155-158, Vas. VI. 6-8 (the first and last of which are the same as Manu IV. 157-158), Anuśāsanaparva 104. 6-9, Vignu Dh. S. 71. 90-92 ( which are almost the same as Manu IV. 155, 156, 158), Mārkaṇdeya chap. 34, Brahmapurāṇa 121. 6-9, Viṣnu purāna III. chapters 11-12, Kurniapurāna (uttarardha, chap.15). 

The general rule about the binding character of customs is set out as follows. Gaut. (XI. 20) obseryes, 1662 the dharmas (customs) of countries, castes and families, which are not upposed to the Vedic scriptures, are authoritative and binding'. Gaut, provides in the next two sūtras that cultivators, traders, herdsmen, money-lenders and artisans can lay down conven tions or usages that would be binding on the respective classes, that when a dispute arises as to these usages the king should learn affairs from those who wield authority over those clagses and decide the dispute accordingly. Vas. I. 17 states, 'Manu has declared that the (peculiar) customs of countries, castes and families may be followed in the absence of rules propounded by the Veda', and in XIX. 7 prescribes that the king should

enforce these among the four varnas. Ap. Dh. S. II. 6. 15.1 appears to lay down that the customs of countries and families (if not opposed to Veda) are authoritative and are to be follow ed in the respective countries or families. But this view seems to be unacceptable to Baudh, Dh. S. (I. 1. 19-26) which says, 1663 thero is difference of opinion regarding five (practices) in the South as well as in the North. We shall explain those peculiar to the south. They are: to eat in the company of ( in the same plate with ) one whose upanayana is not performed, to eat in the company of one's wife, to partake of stale food, to marry the daughter of a maternal uncle or of a paternal aunt. Now ( the customs peculiar) to the north are: to sell wool, to drink rum, to deal in the sale of animals with an upper and a lower row of teeth, to follow the profession of arms and to travel by sea. He who follows (these practices) in any other country than where they are generally in vogue commits sin, For, in respect of these customs the authoritativeness must be restricted to the respective countries. Gautama declares that this is false. And one should not approve of (accept) either ( of the two sets of practices), because they are opposed to the tradition of siṣtas (or opposed to the emptis and the views of śiṣtas)'. The Tantravārtika 1664 (p. 211) mentions the argument of some con cerning these passages of Ap. and Baud, viz. that Apastamba's very general statement that practices of countries and families are authoritative in the respective countries cannot be accepted

as valid, as it is opposed to the views of Gaut. (XI. 20 ), as Baud. expressly states that certain practice, though prevalent in certain localities cannot be accepted as valid and binding even in those localities because they are opposed to the express words of such authoritative and highly yenerated smrtis (as those of Manu). Manu in several places provides for the enfor ceability of customs and usages. In Manu VII. 203 it is said, *the conqueror should hold as authoritative and binding the lawful customs of the conquered country, just as they are stated to be' and in Manu VIII. 41 and 461665 it is provided, 'A king who knows dharma ( sacred law) should carefully inquire into 

· the customs of castes, of countries, of guilds and of families 

and settle (or enforce) the customs peculiar to each. Whatever may have been practised by the good and by twice-born men 

devoted to dharma, that shall be established (by the king) as the law, provided it be not opposed to the ( customs of ) coun tries, families and castes'. Medhatithi adds that the king has to see wliether the customs of countries, families, castes and guilds are directly in conflict with the Veda or are harmful to others or utterly immoral (such as marrying one's mother) and only those that are found not to be 80 are to be enforced by the king and he 1666 adds on Manu II. 6 that the practices of sistas (persons who are well conducted, free from greed and learned in the Veda ) on matters on which the Veda and smrti are silent and which they observe with the consciousness that they (prac tices) are right (dharma) should be deemed to be based on Veda. He offers certain illustrations of such practices and also

It should be noted that in other works also the Pārasikas were credited with the highly immoral practice of marrying one's own mother.

Vol. 

relies 1667 upon the words of the Mahabharata (Vanaparva 313. 117), 'what is true dharma is concealed as in a dark cave; the (only) path is to follow great men'. In I. 118 Mann declares that the ancient (or long enduring ) laws (or customs) of countries, castes, families and the rules among heretics and companies (of traders and the like) have been dealt with by him in the gāstra ( Institutes ). Yāj, I. 343 provides that when a conqueror reduces a country to subjection he should preserve intact whatever customs, laws and judicial procedure, and family usages are handed down from generation to generation therein ( provided they are not opposed to sāstras and, as the Mit. says, he should not cause confusion by imposing the us ages of his own country on the conquered country). Yāj. II. 192 (like Manu and Gaut.) provides that the varying usages and conventions of śreṇis (guilds of artisans), naigamas (traders), heretics and associations (of soldiers and the like) should be respected by the king in the same way as he honours the usages of learned brāhmaṇas. About the latter Yāj. II. 186 says that the king should sedulously enforce the conventions of learned brāhmaṇas which are not opposed to the dictates of the Veda and smrti (such as about pastures, water-courses and wells and the preservation of temples) and he should also enforce his edicts that are not opposed to Veda and smrti (such as making pro vision for travellers and prohibiting the sale of horses to an enemy &c.). Kautilya prescribes 1668 that the king should follow as regards inheritance and partition the customs that are in vogue in a country, a caste, a sangha (company or guild) or a village. Devala 1669 and Bphatparāśara (X. p. 281) have a verse very similar to Yāj. I. 343. The Mahābhārata remarks that there is no custom or practico that can be said to be beneficial

to all alike 1670, ' From this it follows that variations in prac tices were to be tolerated by the king. Bphaspati 1671 advises the king to keep intact the customs of countries, castes and fāmilies that have been long in vogue in them and states that otherwige the subjects become irritated and disaffected and there is logs of wealth and army. He gives certain striking illus trations of peculiar practices: 'members of the twice-born classes in the southern countries take in marriage their mater nal uncle's daughter; in the middle country (the country between the Himalaya and the Vindhya lying to the west of Prayāga and to the east of Vinaśana where the Sarasvati dis appears, as said by Manu II. 21 ) artisans and menial workers eat the flesh of a cow; in the eastern countries people (all in cluding brāhmaṇas ) eat fish and women are given to adultery; in the north women drink liquor and contact with then even in their monthly illness is allowed; the people of the Khasa country take as wives the widows of their own brothers; these several people are not liable to undergo punishment or penance because of their doing these things in the respective countries'. Medie val writers differed about the meaning of the last half verse. The Madanaratna said (acc. to V. P. p. 22) that there is neither punishment nor prāyaścitta when the above practices which are opposed to smrti texts are indulged in by the inhabitants of the countries specified, while the V, P. P. 22 holds that there is only absence of punishment at the king's hands for these people in those countries, but they are still liable to undergo prāyaścitta and that if these practices are followed in other countries both punishment and prayascitta have to be undergone.

I Vol. 

Kat. 1672 defines what is meant by the customs of countries and families and states how and when they are to be enforced: 

That is said to be the custom of a country, which is in vogue in a country, is of long standing and is not opposed to the Veda and Smrti. That is called family custom which has come down hereditarily in a family as right conduct ( dharma) to be observed (by members of that family ); the king should pro serve it as it is. In disputes between the residents of the same country or capital, hamlet of cowherds, town or village the decision should be based on their own conventional usages, but in disputes between inhabitants of these and others the decision must be in accordance with the sacred texts. Therefore the king should decide the causes of people according to the rules of śāstra: but in the absence of texts he should carry out ( the administration of justice ) according to the usage of the coun try. Whatever conventions are settled in accordance with the consent of the people of a ) country should always be preserved in writing sealed with the royal seal. Such conventions should be sedulously upheld as if they were the dictates of sāstra and the king should decide ( disputes ) after carefully consider ing them.' Here Kāt. is principally concerned with the decision of legal disputes on the basis of the customs of countries and fainilies, but his rules also have a general application. He also states that in the case of the conflict of laws by which the parties are governed śāstra prevails. Pita maba 1673 has a similar verse about the usages of towns, villages and guilds and mentions that Bṛ. hold the same view. Manu also (VII. 3 ) requires the king to decide the disputes of people according to principles drawn from local customs ( detadrsta hetu ) and from the Institutes of law ( śāstradıṣta). Medhātithi (on Manu VIII. 3 ) gives some interesting illustrations of local customs; viz. in certain southern localities a sonless widow

occupies a square low table in the hall of justice, when she is struck with dice by the judicial officers and then she gets her husband's property (this is a reminiscence of Nirukta III. 5 explaining Rg. I. 25. 7), in the north there is a custom that when certain persons come on behalf of a bridegroom seeking for a virgin in marriage and they are fed at the house of the girl's father then it is implied that there is a promise to give that girl in marriage to that particular bridegroom. These two customs are not opposed to any sruti or smrti (and even the V. P. p. 10 refers to the second as prevalent in the north and Madhyadesa ). But Medhātithi mentiong other local usages that are opposed to smṛti e. g. grain is lent in spring and in the autumnn of tho same year double of it is taken. This is opposed to the rules of smrti laying down rates of interest. 

Very difficult questions arise in regard to the relative force of sruti, smṛti and sadācāra and numerous rules have been laid down in cases of apparent and real conflicts among them. As Manu II. 6, Vas. 1. 4-5 and Yāj. I. n mention the sources of dharına to be sruti, smrti and sadācara in that order, the Mitāk sarā remarks 1674 that ' in case of conflict, each preceding one of those three has more force (or binding character ) than each succeeding one.' Sruti or Veda is recognised by all smrti writers as the highest or supreme authority for those who desire to know what dharma 1675 is (vide Manu II. 13 and Yāj. I. 40). If two vedic texts of equal authority are in conflict, then Gaut 1676 1. 5, Manu II. 14 and Jābāli declare that there is an option. For example, there are two Vedic texts 'he takes the sodasin cup in the Atirātra sacrifice' and 'be does not take the sodasin cup in the Atirātra'. In this case there is an option. Similarly Vedic texts say that the daily Vedic agnihotra may be performed after sunrise, or before sunrise or when neither the sun nor stars are visible. Therefore there is an option, viz. the daily agni hotra offering may be made at any one of the three times speci fied (Manu II. 15). But a vedic text which is in apparent con flict with another is not always of equal force with that other. In such a case there is no option, and various rules are laid

down in the Pārvamināmsā some important ones among which will be discussed at length in the section on Pūrvamsmāmsā. Such texts may be explained by holding that one lays down a general rule (sāmānya), while the other lays down a special rule ( viśeṣa ) or an exception, or that one is a vidhi and the other merely an arthavāda or that the two texts have different scopes or refer to different ages &c. All these rules about the interpretation of Vedic texts have been held to apply to smrti passages. For example, Manu VIII. 381 is a general rule abso lutely prohibiting the killing of a brābmana. While Manu VIII. 350 allowing the killing of a brāhmaṇa in self-defence is a special rule or may be regarded as a mere artha vāda ( viz. even a guru who is really not to be killed on any account may be killed when he is an atatāyin, what of others, as the Mit, on Yāj. II. 21 explains). Similarly Manu VIII. 351 saying that there is no fault (i.e. no sin, no punishment and no prayaścitta) in playing an ātatayin has restricted scope as applying only to an atatāyin who is not a brahmaṇa. A few more examples will be given immediately. below. 

In cases of conflict between śrutiand smrti, the rules laid down by the Pūrvamimāmsā have already been explained (pp. 839-34). Jaimini VI. 1. 13-14 and Sabara furnish an example. If, relying on Manu VIII. 416, the pūrvapakṣa were to argue that women own no wealth and so should not engage in a vodic sacrifice then as that smrti so interpreted is opposed to the Veda it may be discarded by women 1677, Smṛtis also lay down certain gene rul rules on that point. Laugākṣi 1678 and Jābāla lay down that in case of contradiction between śruti and smrti, the former has greater force and that if there is no contradiction then what is laid down in the smrti should be observed as if it were laid down by the Veda. The Mit, on Yaj. III. 46 admits that a proposit ion of the Veda cannot be set aside (lūdhita ) by even a special proposition in a smrti text. But in spite of the general proposi. tion commentators like Vibyarūpa, Medhātithi and Vijñānesvara

had to admit that what was laid down by śruti texts was set aside or contradicted or abandoned by smrti texts or by popular sentiment. After the Udayaniya (concluding iṣti) in the Agni. stoma sacrifice was finished, a rite was prescribed by Vedic texts in which a barren cow (called Anūbandhyā) was sacrificed for Mitra and Varuṇa. But later on this was condemned and in lieu of a cow. amikṣā ( mixture of heated milk and curds ) was substituted. Vide H. D. II. pp. 1200-1201 for the anūbandhyā cow and p. 628 n. 1198 above for the verse quoted by the Mit. on Yaj. II. 117 condemning cow sacrifice in Kaliyuga. Yāj. III. 234 puts govardha ( slaughter of a cow ) at the head of upapā takas. Medhātithi on Manu IV. 176 after stating that even such acts as donating all one's property in the Visvajit sacrifice or killing a cow should not be done ( though sanctioned by the Veda) remarks that he gives that explanation following his predecessors' views but that to him it appears that an express śruti toxt cannot be set aside by a smrti passage 1679. Viśvarūpa also ( on pp. 25-26 ) after adverting to the fact that Yāj. III. 234 places govadha at the head of Upapatakas remarks that this may apply to the killing of cows spoken of in smrtis such as at the time of samāvartana (vide Manu III. 3) and that the rule must be upheld that a smrti that is, in confict with an express text of the Veda is to be set aside. Sometimes even a smrti text though theoretically weaker than śruti was allowed to prevail over a śruti. For example, the Veda prescribes the filling of the cups of wine in Sautrāmaṇi iṣṭi, but this is one of the matters prohibited in Kali 1680 (vide cliapter on Kalivarjyas below). 

The general rule is that when a custom or usage is opposed to the text of the Veda the latter must prevail. So early a writer as Āpastamba states this rule emphatically in several places. In Āp. Dh. 8. I. 1. 4. 8 it is stated 1681 : "For, an ex plicit śruti text has greater force than ācāra (usage) from which a śruti text (on which it may be supposed to be based )

may be inferred.' In I. 11. 30. 8-9 Ap. Dh. S. gays, during the morning and evening twilights a snātaka should be seated outside the village and should restrain his speech ( should not speak about worldly matters ); but (an agnihotrin must not go out for) what is enjoined by sruti is of more force in case of conflict of duties'. Similarly in Ap. II. 9. 23. 8-9, 'It is the settled view of those who are deeply learned in the three Vedas that they are (highest) authority. They consider that the rites which are there prescribed for performance with rice, yuva, animals, clarified butter, inilk, potsherds ( in conjunction) with the wife and accompanied by loudly or inaudibly recited (mantras ) must be performod and that a usage opposed to these rites is without authority'. In spite of this and the doctrine of the Pūrvamiināmsā stated above (p. 843) usages sprang up that were opposed to or gave the go-by to the prescriptions of the Veda as will appoar a little below and particularly in the section on Kalivarjya. 

The conflict of sınṭtis among themselves presents much greater difficultiex. From very ancient times authors of smrtis differed greatly among themselves. A few striking examples may be cited: Āp. Dh. S. (1. 6. 19. 2-12) cites the views of ten predecessors on the question of the persons whose food may be partaken of by a brāhmana (kui iiśyānnuh). The difference between Gautama and Baudhāyana on the one hand and Āp. on the other on the question of the validity of certain usages in certain localities has already been referred to (p. 858). In III. 16 Manu mentions three views ( and four sages) on the question of the position of a brālmana who marries a śūdra wife or has a son or a child from her. Baud. Dh. S. I. 8.2, Manu III. 13, Viṣnu Dh. S. 24. 1-4, Pār. Gr. I. 4, Vas. I. 25 show that brāhmāṇas were allowed to have sūdra women as wives. But Yāj. 1. 56 empha tically dissents from this by stating 'this is not my view'. In this state of affairs the medieval digests and commentators were hard put to it to evolve rules of interpretation. One rule early evolved was that when two smrti texts were in oonfict, * reasoning based on the practices of elders ( śistas ) was of grea tor force' (Yaj. II. 21 ) 1682. The Mit. explains that ratiocina

tion may take the form of holding that one text lays down a general rule and the other lays down a special rule(which prevails over a general rule ), or the text may be held to relate to diffe. rent sets of circumstances or in the last resort it may be held that there is an option, but in arriving at these conclusions the practice of the old or of śistas who follow the rule in one text and discard or avoid the rule in the other text is the guide 1683. Br. 1684 gives the following warning to those who do not take reasoning into consideration: The decision (in a cause ) should not be given by merely relying on śāstras, for in the case of a decision devoid of reasoning loss of dharına results'. Nār. ( L. 40 ) provides in a strain similar to the Mit., 'wlien there is conflict between two texts of dharmaśāstra, it is declared that the method to adopt is to resort to reasoning, for the practices (of śistas ) are of great force and the strict letter of the law is overruled by them (or properly understood through them)'. These provisions remind us of the working of the principle of requitus applied by the prætors in Rome to the rigid older legislation or the influence of Equity in English Law. When

The exact meaning of' equity' in this translation is not clear. It certainly does not mean equity' in the strict sense of English Law.

old rules become too narrow or are deemed to be not in harmony with the views of a changing or progressive society, it was thought to be the privilege of the king or the judge to adopt his practice to the existing state of society and not to decide a case by a too strict adherence to ancient dicta. 

Another rule that was laid down was that in case of con flict between dharmaśāstra and arthaśāstra, the fornier is of more weight or authority or that one should discard the rule in 

the arthaśāstra 1685 (Ap. Dh. S. I. 9. 24. 23; Yāj. II. 21; Nār. I. 39; Kāt. 20 ). Vide pp. 8-9 above for an explanation of this rule. The rule of the arthaśāstra has the accomplishment of a visible or worldly purpose as the goal, while the dharmaśāstra rule has as its purpose the securing of unseen or spiritual results. Therefore the latter from a spiritual or ethical point of view is superior to the former. 

Soveral other methods of resolving conflicts between smṛtis may be mentioned here. Br. 1686 states: 'Manusmrti occupies a pre-eminent position because it puts together the purport of the Vedas; that smrti which is in conflict with the purport of Manu is not commended'. Angiras also states that to follow the words (of another smrti) disregarding the unrivalled dharmaśāstra of Manu would not be beneficial to a person. The Mit. on Yāj. III. 300 speaks of the Manusmrti and others as the great smrtis (maha-smrti). Some writers 1687 quote the Vedic text'whatever Manu said is indeed medicine' in this connec tion, thereby identifying the author of the Manusmrti with the Manu named in the Vedas. But this does not afford much help. Another principle evolved was that certain rules of conduct and certain smrtis were of special authority in certain cycles of time. Manu (I. 85-86 = Santi 232. 27-28 = Parāśara I. 22-23

Usages of several yugas differ 

869 

Brhat-Parāśara I. p. 55) himself says that the dharmas differ according to which of the four yugas is current, viz. tapos is the highest dharma in the Kṭta age, knowledge in Tretā, yajña in Dvāpara and only dūna in Kali. This verse only means that in a particular yuga the predominant or easily per formed dharma is the one indicated but the verse does not mean that a dharma predominant in one yuga was prohibited in another. Parāśara I. 24 1688 ( = Bphat-Parāśara I. p. 55) declares that in the Krta age the dharnas (to be observed ) were those promulgated by Manu, in Tretā those of Gautama, in Dyāpara those of Saṅkha-Likhita and in Kali those of Parasara. This also did not solve all difficulties, since the medieval digests and commentaries found that even what was allowed by Parāśara came to be disapproved of or condemned by the people. Many prescriptions of the smṛtis were therefore included under Kali ruerjyn (acts forbidden in the Kali age) on the ground that action, though at one time prescribed or sanctioned by the sāstra, should not be resorted to, if it has become hateful to the people, since it would not lead to heaven 1689 (if persisted in). This was the dictum of Yaj. I. 156 ( = Bphan-Nāradiya-purāna 24.12 ), Manu IV. 176, Viṣṇu Dh. S. (71. 84-85), the Viṣnupurana (III. 11.7 ), Sukra III. 64, Bārhaspatya-sūtra ( on Arthaśāstra ) V. 16. Vide p. 630 and n. 1202 above. These texts were relied upon for prohibiting certain acts (though done in former times) by the Mit. (on Yāj. II. 117, III. 18), V. P. (p. 442 ) and others, But these devices of interpretation also proved futile in certain cases. On the question of the periods of mourning due to death for ksatriyas and others the texts are so various and so confic ting that even the great Vijñāneśvara declares (on Yāj. III. 22 ) that he is not going to furnish any orderly presentation of the smrti texts assigning to each its proper province, since it would be useless to do so in view of the fact that the usage of śiṣtas did not agree with most of them 1690. Viśvarūpa also (on Yaj. III. 30) is in the same predicament. The commentators (such as

History of Dharmaśāstra 

[ Vol. 

Madhava in Par. M. on I. 1. p. 84) were aware that people would not go in for religious practices that called for great effort and would seek for such rules as would be easy of observance. 1691 

In some cases it was provided tliat where there is a conflict among smptis the view of the majority should prevail. Gobhila sinrti (III. 148-149) provides 1692 that where there is a conflict among passages (of smrtis ), authoritativeness rests with that view which is supported by a majority of the texts, but where two passages are of equal authority then reasoning has to be einployed. The assumption or axiom was, according to Medha tithi1693 ( on Manu II. 29 and XI. 216), Mit. (on III. 325), Sun, C. (I. p. 5), Apararka p. 1053, Madanapārijāta (pp. 11, 91 ) and otliers that all smṛtis form one śāstra, that if some smrti texts on the same subject are in conflict there is an option and when there is no conflict all rules from all smrtis should be held applicable to the subject matter; this was based on the analogy of the maxiin called 'sarva-sākhāpratyayanyāya' or 'sākhān taradhikarana ' ( vide Jai. II. 4.9 and Sabara thereon). 

It is further provided that works of heretical sects were to be left out of consideration. Manu calls thern emptis, but they 

are outside the pale of Vedic orthodoxy. Manu (XII. 95) declared, 1694 + the smrtis that are outside the ( pale of) Veda. and all false or fallacious doctrines are of no avail after death, because they are all based on ignorance'. In the Vedantasūtra (II. 1. 1) also the word smrti is applied to the works on the

Heretical works have no authority 

871 

Saṅkhya philosophy. The Tantravārtika (p. 195) says that the Bauddhas and other heretical sects do not admit that their doctrines are based on the Veda, like a bad son hating his parents ; the prescriptions contained in their works are opposed to all the 14 vidyās except in the case of a few sentences laying down restraint of senses, charity and the like; they were proinulgated by persons like the Buddha who had given up the path of the Veda and did acts contrary to the Veda and they were propounded to persons that were beyond the pale of the three Vedas and that mostly were sūdras and persons outside the system of the four varnas and āśrainas. Medhatithi on Manu II. 6 adopts this and remarks 1695 that the Sākyas, Bhojakas and Ksapapakas do not admit the Veda as authoritative, they openly declare the Veda to be unauthoritative and they teach doctrines directly opposed to the Veda. The Caturvimśatimata 1696 states that the words of Arhat (Jina), of Cārvāka and of Bauddhas, should be abandoned as they lead to delusion. 

Then comes the question of the conflict between smstis and purānas. It has been shown in the H, of Dh., vol. I. pp. 160–167, how the Purāṇas are rich in Dharmaśāstra material. The sūtras and early smrtis do not look upon the Purāṇas as a source of dharma, though Gaut. XI, 19 and Yāj.

Dh, S. quotes from a Purana in 1. 6. 19. 13, 1. 10. 29. 8 and II. 9. 23. 3 and names a Bhavisyatpurāṇa in II. 9. 24. 6. It is to be noted that the views quoted by Āp. from the Purānas in the first three passages are opposed to the views of the Kalivarjya section alleged to be taken from the Adityapurāna in medieval digests. The passage of the Tantra vārtika stating that Puranas, Manusmrti and Itihasa are universally accepted throughout India has been already quoted (on p. 853). When Manu states that smrti is a source of dharma he does not obviously com prehend Purāṇas under smrti as Manu II. 10 clearly shows ( dharmaśāstrar tu vai smirtih). Manu III. 232 and Yāj. III. 189 employ the plural 'Purāṇāni' and so those smrtis obviously

The Striparva (13.2) also employs the plural and the Svargā rohanikaparva (5. 46-47) speaks of Krsna Draipāyana as the author of 18 Purāṇas. The Adiparva 1697 (1. 293-94) prescribes that one should strengthen the Veda by. (the study of) the Itihāsa and Purāṇa and that the Veda fears the man whose knowledge is insignificant 'this man will harm me'. Accord ing to the Bhāgavata-purāṇa I. 4. 25 the purpose 1698 of the composition of the Mahābhārata was this that as the Veda cannot be learnt by women, sūdras and brāhmaṇas who are so only by birth ( and do not study) the sage Vyāsa took com passion on them and composed the Mahābhārata for their bene fit. The same must be deemed to be the purpose of the com position of the purāṇas. The Dakṣasmrti II. 69 prescribes 1699 the recitation of itihāsa and purāṇa in the 6th and 7th parts of the day (divided into 8 parts). The Auśanasa smrti (III. p. 515, Jivananda) prescribes the study of the Veda in the bright half of the months from Māgha after utsarjana and the study of the Vedāngas and of Purāna in the dark half. It appears that some at least of the extant Purāṇas were composed in the first centuries of the Christian era and that from early times they contained dharmaśāstra material. In another section the paurānadharina will be separately dealt with hereafter. Gradually the Puranas became very popular in the course of centuries, some of the original rites prescribed by the Veda and the early smrtis went out of vogue and new modes of worship and rites provided by the Purānas came into general obser vance, The Vedavyāsa smrti 1700 (1. 4) and the Sangraha state that in case of conflict between smrti and purāṇa smrti is to be

· preferred. Aparārka (p. 9) quotes 1701 a smrti text, 'that is highest dharma which is understood from the Veda, that is to be known as inferior dharma that is declared in the Purāṇas and the like'. Aparārka (p. 15) further tells us that 1702 accor ding to the Bhavisyatpurāṇa the purāṇas are of authority in declaring dharma that is vyāmiśra (i. e. mixed up and not purely Vedic). Medieval writers were often divided as to the authoritativeness of purāṇas. Mitramisra (in his commen tary 1903' on Yāj. II. 21) asserts that dharmaśāstra (viz. smsti) is not more authoritative tha n purāna and that in case of con flict between a smrti text and a purana text recourse must be had to reasoning as in the case of conflict between two smptis. On the other hand, the V. Mayūkha, 1704 after quoting Manu IX. 126 and Devala about the first born among twins being regarded as the oldest and after referring to a half verse from the Bhagavatapurāna (rather from the commentary of Sridhara thereon) which holds that among twins the one born later is to be deemed as the elder, remarks that the Purāṇa passage is to be set aside in favour of the sinsti passages and that in the purāṇas usages opposed to the smrtis are very frequently met with. It further says that this view is preferable to that of some others according to whom in this matter the custom of the country should be followed. The Nirnayasindhu (III. p. 251 ) also says the same. The respect for the purāṇas carried away late medieval writers so far that relying on some pro phetic passages in the purāṇas about the disappearance of four varpas in the Kali age and the subsistence of only brāh manas and sūdras therein, they denied the existence of ksatriyas and vaisyas in the Kali age, in spite of the fact that all smṛtis (like Manu, Yāj., Parāsara) and many commentaries (including the Mitākṣarā) hold that the four varnas exist in the Kali age.

The case of conflict between smṛti and customs has now to be considered. The general rule deduced from Vas. I. 5, Yāj. I. 7 and supported by the Mit. (on Yāj. I. 7 and II. 117), the Sm, C. ( II. p. 266 ), Kullūka (on Manu. II. 10 ) and several others is that smtṛi is of superior authority to the usages of the siṣtas. But from early times there have been dissenting voices. Visvarūpa on Yāj. III. 250 states that that purport of the smrtis is to be followed which is in accordance with the settled practice of the sistas resident in Aryāvarta 1705. On Manu IV. 176 Medhatithi points out that niyoga is permitted by such omstis 1706 a8 Gaut. 18.4-14, Yāj. I. 68-69, Vas. 17. 56-65, but being condemned by the people it is not practised. There fore the principle that may be deduced from these is that the prescriptions of smṛtis ( and oven of śruti) need not be observed and should not be observed when they are vehemently condemned by the people. The chapter on Kalivarjya will make this clear, Commentators like Medhātithi (on Manu II. 10) went 80 far as to say that Dharmasastra is that which prescribes what is to be done for attaining dharma, that is smrti from which dharma which one performs as a duty is understood and there fore sistā cāra 1707 also is smrti. The smrtis theinselves embodied the practices of the people current in their days, as Manu I. 107 declares, ' in this work dharma has been fully stated as well as the good and evil qualities of (human ) actions and the ancient customs and usages of the four varṇas.' 1708 Manu adds (I. 108), 

acara ( customs and usages) are transcendental law, and so are the practices declared in the Veda and the smrti; therefore a twice-born person desirous of his own welfare should always

Binding character of usages

make efforts to follow it '. 1709 This has been the basic text in modern decisions that recognize the binding nature of customs. It is therefore necessary to understand the exact meaning of this verse. Two constructions are possible; (1) that the word ācāra is qualified by the words. śrutyukta' and 'smārta' and that the first half declares that usages declared in the Veda or smrti are transcendental law (this is the meaning given by most commentators of Manu ); (2) that acāra by itself and other rules of conduct declared in the sruti or smrti are transcen dental (i. e. here in the first half of the verse there is a reference to three kinds of ācāras, as Govindaraja and Nandana explain ). If we look to the preceding verse and the following verses ( that eulogise ācāra ) the 2nd construction looks more natural and has been accepted by the decided cases when 1710 they lay down that * immemorial usage is transcendental law' (Sir William Jones' translation of Manu I. 108) and that "under the Hindu system of law clear proof of usage will outweigh the written text of the law". The Anuśāsana (141. 65) and Santi 354. 6 expressly state that dharma is threefold viz. that declared in the Veda, that declared in the smrtis and the third is what is practised by sistas. Sumantu 1711 emphatically declares that family usage should be preferred to the prescriptions of sāstra. The Kūrmapurāṇa 1712 ( Uttarardha 15. 19) appears to support the and interpretation when it says, 'one should observe that acara which is declared by the sruti and smrti and which is rightly followed by the good'. The exact import of the word acāra (or gadācāra ) has been shifting from age to age and among com mentators. In the earliest days, as shown by the Tai. Up., Gaut. (28. 48, 51 ), Baud. Dh. 8. I. 1. 4-9, Manu XII. 108-109,

History of Dharmasastra 

[Vol. 

Vas. I. 6, the acāra to be followed was that observed or declared by learned brāhmanas who were highly moral and selflegs (the śistas ). Medhatithi on Mann II. 6 states that binding acāra is that of sistas learned in the Vedas. Gradually every usage that had no visible secular purpose came to be looked upon as binding and lastly the usages of sūdras, of pratiloma castes and even of heterodox sects became, as will be shown in the sequel, enforceable by the king. As observed in 39 Mad. 298, 301 the commentarios indicate an attempt to reconcile the text law with the actual usages of the people. 

The requisites of valid customs, according to the smrtis and commentaries and digests, are similar to those laid down by the writers on Pūrvamimāmsā i, e, they must be ancient, must not be opposed to sruti and smrti, must be such that they are regard ed by respectable people as obligatory on them and such as are observed with that consciousness by the sistas, they must be strictly construed and cannot be availed of by others not within their purview and must not be immoral or severely condemned by popular sentiment. Customs once in vogue may be abandon ed by the people as the chapter on Kalivarjya will show. 

From Gaut., Manu, Bp., Kāt. and other writers quoted above it follows that the customs and usages of which account has to be taken are those of districts ( deśa or janapada ), towns and villages, castes, families, guilds or corporations or groups (gana, śrepi, sangha, naigama, varga). A few words on each of these and on usages of gotrus and sākhas will be said later on and a few illustrations of each will be given. But first of all certain preliminary observations have to be made about customs in general. The medieval writers on Dharmaśāstra make it clear that customs that depart from the generally received smrti prescriptions must be strictly construed and that they cannot be extended on the ground of analogy to other matters outside the specific acknowledged customs. For example, both the Sm. O.(I.. 71) and the Smrtimuktāphala 1713 (on Varpāśrama p. 31) say that, though one's maternal uncle's daughter can be married (by custom) yet one's mother's sister or mother's sister's daughter

cannot be married, because popular sentiment is opposed to the latter kind of marriages and popular sentiment has to be respected as Manu declares (in IV. 176). Similarly the Samskara kaustubha 1714 and the Dharmasindhu provide that where there is a local or family usage for narrowing down the limits of sapiṇda relationship in marriage, only those who belong to that locality or family can avail themselves of such narrowing down, but if a person in a different locality or belonging to a different fainily were to follow the practice of narrowing down the sapinda relationship, he would incur blame. Owing to the vastness of Bharatavarṣa it was recognised that what was sadācāra in one country would not be so in another, as is noted by the Par. M. (I. 2. p. 65 ) in relation to marriage with one's maternal uncle's daughter,1715 

A few words may now be said about customs of countries. That usages about details of ritual varied a great deal even in the Vedic times is quite clear. The Sat. Br. (1. 1. 4. 13 ) notes that in former times it was the wife of the sacrificer that rose at the Hayiṣkpt call, but that in its own day the wife or a priest ( the Agnidhra) rises in angwer to the call. Vide H. of Dh. vol. II. p. 1027 and n. 2311 on the Haviskrt call. For similar differences in practices vide the same Brahmana XII. 3. 5.1 and XII. 6. 1. 41. The Ait. Br. frequently refers to one view and refutes it by saying that one should not do so (tat tatha na kuryāt ) or one should discard it (tat tat nādrtyam ) e. g. vide . chap. 12. 7, 17. 1, 18. 8, 28.1, 29.5. Vide also Tai, Br. I. 1. 8, I. 3,1, III. 8.8 for similar words.

noted above (pp. 856-857). Baudhāyana made a distinction about the customs of the northern and southern people ( countries ). That customs of the northern and southern countries differed is emphasized by many commentators and writers of digests. For example, the Mit, on Yāj. I. 256 refers to the differing views of dakśiṇātyas and udicyas on Ekoddista-śrāddha. Saṅkara bhatta in the introductory verses of the Dvaitanirṇaya (or Dharma-dvaita-) expressly states that he will furnish solutions of knotty points in Dharmaśāstra after abiding by the views of southern writers. 1716 The Nirnayasindhu in its section on sāpiṇdya speaks of Sūlapāṇi, Vācaspati and Suddhiviveka as Gaudas and Maithilas, and points out that Sūlapāni in the Sambandha viveka and the Sambandhatattva (a Gauda work) allow marriage with a girl separated by three gotsas from the bride groom, while the southern writers ( dākṣiṇatyas ) do not accept the view. But in those days there were no rigid territorial boundaries for certain practices or doctrines. For example, Vijñāneśvara, Madana-ratna, Pārijāta, Vācaspati and Sūlapāṇi accepted the view that sāpindya arises from community of the particles of the body, while Aparārka, Smrticandrika and Madhava ( though they were southern writers like Vijñānesvara) held that sāpiṇdya was based on the offering of pinda in śrāddhas. The fashion of dividing Hindu works into schools and assigning them definite territorial limits started with Colebrooke and has been perpetuated by decisions of the Privy Council and of the Indian High courts. Vide Collector of Madura v. Mootoo 12 Mad. I. A. 397 at p. 432 (for reference to Colebrooke), p. 435 ( as to how schools arose ), pp. 436-437 (as to different schools ). Strange results have flowed from this. The Vyavahāra mayūkha, written by Nilakaptha, whose family belonged to Paithan in Mahārāstra and migrated to Benares and who himself wrote under the patronage of a Bundella chief, came to be regarded as a work of the highest authority in Gujerat and North Konkan (even superseding the Mitākṣarā ), while in Mahārāṣtra proper its authority is subordinate to that of the Mitakṣarā. The Mit. ( on Yāj. II. 119 ) avers that in the section on the partition of heritage the texts generally repeat what is

already current among the people 1717 and that if Yāj. II. 118-119 were interpreted to mean that the words' what is acquired at the cost of paternal estate by a person himself' stand by themselves and do not qualify the other clauses, then what is acquir ed through friendship even at the cost of the paternal estate would not be liable to partition, which would be opposed to the practice among people. The Vyavahāra-mayūkha also 1918 says on Manu IX. 210 ( about reunion) that the law and administra tion of justice are generally based as is the case with grammar on people's usages. The Viramitrodaya also states that all writers of digests are agreed that smrtis on Vyavāhara generally re-iterate recognized popular usages. 

Customs of countries and families have been specially recognized from very ancient times in the sphere of marriage. The Āśv. gr. (I. 7, 1-2 ) has been already cited above (p. 856 ). The commentators on Āśy. gp., Haradatta and Nārāyaṇa, both mention that in certain countries sexual intercourse is com menced immediately after marriage, that this practice is oppos ed to the rule in Aśv. g£. I. 1. 10 that the married couple should be celibate after marriage for at least three nights (if not for a longer period ) and that one should follow the rule laid down in the gļhyasūtra and not the usage of the country. The Āp. gr. (II. 15 ) remarks, 1719 ' people should understand from women (and others ) what procedure is (to be followed according to the custom of the country )' and the commentator Sudarśanā. carya notes that certain rites like the worship of planets, ankurūropana and the tying of pratisara ( a string or ribbon tied round the wrist) are usual and are performed with Vedio Mantras. The Kathakagshya ( 25. 7) allows the usages of countries and families to be observed in marriage and the

commentators mention some usages, viz. Devapāla refers to stat ing the purpose of the visit, announcing the name of the maiden, worship of family deity, striking with flowers and creepers. The com. Brāhmaṇabala states that in Kashmir'at the time of marriage the mother-in-law or some other woman whose husband is alive ties an auspicious wreath on the heads of the bride and the bridegroom, that the mother-in-law places flowers on the feet, knees, shoulders and head of the bridegroom and on the same seven places of the bride's body flowers are placed but in the reverse order ( i. e. first on the left limb and then on the right), 

Haradatta on Gaut. XI. 20 (cited above in n. 1662) mentions the following usages: in the Cola country while the sun is in the zodiacal sign of Aries maidens draw with powders of various colours on the ground an orb of the sun together with attendants and offer worship in the morning and evening; on the full moon day of Margasirṣa maidens putting on ornaments walk about in the village and offer to a temple idol whatever they get in their wanderings; when the sun is in the sign of the Crab, maidens worship the goddess Umā while the moon is in the constellation of the Pūryā Phalgunis and offer to the gods mudga beans that have put forth sprouts and salt; when the sun is in the sign of Pisces, house-holders worship the Goddess of wealth while the moon is in the constellation of Uttarā Phalguni, Ap. Dh. S. II. 6. 13,7 notes that in certain countries the special portions of the eldest son in paternal wealth are gold, dark-coloured cattle and black-coloured produce of the soil (i. e. black grain). Vide Bp. and Tantravārtika quoted above ( as to customs of certain countries). 

Several such illustrations may be furnished from other writers, but considerations of space make it necessary to omit reference to them. 

The Pār. gr.,8. 1 8 states 1720 that the usages of villages may be followed, since a text says 'one should enter a village (i. e, follow the opinion of village elders ) in case of marriage and funeral rites' and since the Veda says that 'the village is the authority in these two.'

Caste customs 

881 

Numer ous caste customs have been recognized from ancient times to these days. Gaut. XI. 20, Vas. I. 17, Manu I. 118, VIII. 41 and 46, Kaut. III. 7, Sukra IV. 5. 47 emphasize the validity of caste customs and call upon the king to enforce them. Yaj. I. 361 advises the king to punish those who swerve from the usages of their family, caste, guild, or group. Katya yana (40) enjoins 1721 that the king should not disregard the fixed usages even of pratiloma castes and of the inhabitants of inaccessible places (mountain forts or habitations ), even if they be opposed ( to the rules of smrtis ). In the Paribhāsa prakasa Mitramiśra holds 1722 that the usages of good sūdras, free from moral defects are binding on their sons and others even though they do not know the Veda. 

Compared to Western Christian countries very great religious tolerance prevailed in ancient India. Vide H. of Dh. vol. II. pp. 388 (n. 928 a), 723-724 for some remarks on this. Asoka in his Pillar Edict VII (E. I. vol. II. p. 272 ) says that he looked after sanghas, brāhmaṇas, Ājivakas and all other sects (pāṣanda ). The Bhagavadgitā (IX. 23-25 ) proclaims that the devotees that worship other gods do worship Krsna himself though in an irregular way and that those who offer worship to the Manes or to the elements reach the goals they desire. The Mānasollasa enjoins 1723 that one should give up condemnation of or hatred towards other gods, that one should show reverence on seeing an image or a temple and should not pass it over (in contempt ). People of different countries no doubt twitted each other on the customs and usages peculiar to each; but it rarely went beyond the bandying of words. For example, even such a

philosophical work as the Jivanmuktiviveka remarks 1724 that brahmanas of the south condemn even the learned brāhmaṇas of the north as flesheaters and brāhmaṇas of the north condemn southern brāhmaṇas because they marry their maternal uncle's daughters and because they carry earthen vessels in fairs or on pilgrimages. It was on account of the general attitude of religious tolerance that the smrtis and digests prescribe that open the usages of heretical sects should be enforced by the king. Yāj. II. 192 prescribes 1725 that the king should guard against breach of the distinctive usages and conventions of guilds (of artisans), of traders, of heretical sects and bands (of soldiers). Narada (samayasyānapakarma 1-3) states 1736 that the king should uphold the conventions of heretical sects, of traders, guilds and other groups and that whatever traditional usages, activities, mode of attendance and means of maintenance were peculiar to them should be permitted to them by the king without introducing any change. Among the matters of which the king was to take cognizance suo motu and included under prakirṇaka by Nārada (verse 2) was the transgression of the usages of heretics, traders, guilds and ganas, Brhaspati provides 1721 that in disputes among husbandmen, artisans, wrestlers, money lenders, guilds, dancers, heretics, thieves, a decision is to be given in accordance with their conventions. It is no doubt true that certain smrtis present a sterner treatment of heretics and

Treatment of heretics and the like

the like. Gaut. IX. 17 provides 1723 that a snataka should not talk with mlecchas, impure persons and sinners. Manu IX, 225 prescribes that the king should banish from his capital gamblers, dancers, heretics, vintners &c. Manu IV.30 holds that one should not honour as guests even by words persons who are heretios, rogues &c. and recommends that one should not reside in a country which is overrun by groups of heretics. Yāj. II. 70 and Nār. (rṇādāna 180 ) say that a heretic (pākhandi) or an atheist is not a proper witness. These passages may be explained in various ways. Probably the prescriptions of Gautama and Manu refer to an age when the schism caused by Buddhists and Jainas was not very old and feelings between the followers of the Veda and the heretics ran high. But most of these prescrip tions are addressed to the followers of the Veda as individuals. They do not negative the requirements laid down by Nār., Br. and others that the king ( though of a different persuasion ) was to enforce among heretics their own usages. It can be said without any fear of contradiction that at least from the 4th century A. D. onwards the policy of the State in India was to protect all religions, but to interfere with none '. 1729 

Customs of families will be briefly referred to later on in connection with modern law cases. Among family customs the customs about the year when caula was performed and the locks of hair kept on the head in the caula ceremony are frequently mentioned in the gphya sūtras and other works. Vide H. of Dh, 

vol. II pp. 260 and 265. 

The digests contain numerous examples about the customs and usages that were adhered to among the followers of the several Vedic branches (sākkās) and the gphya gūtras in perform ing several religious rites. A few examples may be set out here by way of illustration. According to Yaj. L 242 the offering of pindas to the pitss in a sraddha takes place after the brahmapas invited at the śrāddha are fed, while Manu III. 261 shows that they were offered also before the brāhmaṇas were fed. The Sm. C. (on śrāddha p. 471) says that one should follow the practice of one's own Vedic sakha. Among the five daily sacrifices ( mahāyajfias) one is pitryajña, which aco, to some ( such as Katyāyana ) means tarpaṇa, while according to Manu

I p. 191 and Madanapārijāta p. 286 ). About the month of pregnancy in which the ceremony of sīmantonnayana was to be performed each person was to follow his own grhyasūtra (Sm. O. I. p. 17, and Par. M. I. part 2 p. 22). The same holds good as to the day of nāmakarana (Sm. O. I. p. 21, Par, M. I. part 2 p. 25). It is not necessary to multiply examples. According to Gaut. XI. 21-22 and others already cited above, the king has to enforce the usages of guilds ( śreṇi) and corporations. Several such usages have been cited above ( pp. 487-488). 

## 34 Kalivarjya

CHAPTER XXXIV 

KALIVARJYA 

(ACTIONS FORBIDDEN IN THE KALI AGE. ) 

It has been stated above (pp. 865-866 ) that one of the several ways in which the conflict between several smṛti texts was got over was to hold some of them as legislating for a bygone age (yugāntara ). For example, when Hārsta allowed upanayana to women, both the Sm. C. (1. 24 ) and Par. M. (1. 2. p. 83 ) hold that the text refers to another kalpa (aeon). In H. of Dh. vol. II. (on pp. 151, 162, 424, 451, 603,612, 620,750,790, 796, 928, 929,934,953, 1005 n, 1201 n) reference has been made to several matters forbidden in the Kali age. It is remarkable in this connection to note that, though the Parāśarasmrti ( in I. 24 ) claims par excellence to lay down the dharmas for the Kali age, several inportant provisions contained in it, viz. the remarriage of a married woman 1730 (Parāsara IV. 30), the variation in the period of impurity due to births and deaths depending on the learning and character of a brāhmaṇa Parāśara II. 5-6), permission for a brāhmaṇa to partake of the food of five classes among sūdras (XI. 21 ) are included among Kalivarjyas by the Adityapurāṇa (as quoted by writers of the 12th and later centuries ). It is necessary, therefore, to investigate into the origin and development of the Yuga theory and of the topic of Kalivarjya. 

From the Mahabharata (Santi 59 ), Manu (1. 81 ), Nārada (I. 1-2), Bṭhaspati and the Purāṇas it is clear that they all believed in the existence of an ideally perfect community in the dim past followed by gradual degeneracy and decline in morals, health and lengti of life. But they also believed that a.cycle of decline would be followed in the far distant future

by another of moral perfection. The only pity is that all works that are extant think that they are in the midst of a very sinful age and there is not a single work which thinks that the era of perfection may dawn in the very near future, 

The germ of the theory of progressive deterioration in morals is found even in the Rgveda. In the famous dialogue of Yama and Yami the former exclaims in one place 1731 (Rg. X. 10. 10) 'those later ages are yet to come when sisters would do what is not sister-like'. The word 'yuga' occurs at least 33 times in the Rg., but the exact meaning is somewhat doubt ful. In a few places it means yoke'( Rg. X. 60. 8, X. 101. 3 and 4). In several places it appears to stand for a very brief period of time ( e. g. Rg. III. 26. 3). Generally it means 'a generation' (as in Rg. I. 92. 11, I. 103, 4, I. 124. 2, II. 2.2, III. 33. 8, V. 52. 4). In Rg. I. 158. 6 'dirghatamā māmateyo jujurvān dasame yuge'yniga probably means 'a period of four or five years ', while in Rg. VI. 15. 8, VI. 8. 5, X. 72. %, X, 94. 12, X. 97. 1 it should mean 1732 ' a long period of time'. In the Atharvaveda VIII. 2. 21 yuga appears to mean a period of several thousand years, two yugas being indicated as longer than 10000 years ( satam tesyutam hāyanān dve yuge tiṇi catvāri krnmah). Here there is a clear reference to four yugas and to the fact that yuga' meant a very long period of time. What ever be the meaning of the word in each passage, the Rgveda doos not contain the names of all the four well-known yugas viz. Kșta, Tretā, Dvāpara and Kali. The word “Kfta' when used in the Rgveda appears to mean 'the best throw of dice or of the seeds of vibhitaka in gambling '(X. 34. 6, X. 43. 5). In the Atharvaveda VII. 52. %, 5, 6 kpta has the same meaning. Kali is the name of the author of Rg. VIII. 66 and in verse 15

of that hymn we read "kalayo mā bibhitana' (O descendants of Kalil do not be afraid ). In Rg. X. 39. 8 the Asvins are said to have rejuvenated Kali who had become old. Vide also Rg. I. 112. 15 ( where Kali is said to have got a wife from Aśving ). But Kali as a throw of dice does not occur in the Rgveda. In the Atharvaveda VII. 114. 1 Kali 1733 means a throw of dice. The words kyta, treta, dvūpara and āskanda occur in the Tai. S. IV. 3. 3, Vāj. S. 30. 181734 and in the Sat. Br. XIII. 6. 2. 9-10 (S. B. E. vol. 44 p: 416). In later literature Kali is also called Tiṣya (as in Bhiṣmaparva 10. 3). In the Tai. Br. III. 4. 16 the word Kali is used 1735 in place of Askanda. In all the above places Kfta and the other three words denote throws in gambling, Krta being the most lucky and Kali being the most unlucky. In another passage of the Tai. 1736 Br. (1.5.11) we read the four stomas (Trivrt, Pañcadaśa, Saptadasa and Ekavimśa) are Krta and the five are Kali; therefore the catuscoma (should be performed in the Jyotiṣtoma). This shows that Kșta meant a throw of four or any multiple of four and Kali a throw which when divided by four left one as remainder. The Aitareya Br. employs the words Kļta 1737 and the other three in a metaphorical sense as representing progres. sively more desirable states of human activity, one lying down becomes Kali, when about to leave the bed he becomes Dvāpara, when rising he becomes Tretā, and when he moves about he

becomes Krta'. The Sat. Br. V. 4. 4. 6 speaks of Kali 1738 as * abhibhu' (the vanquisher ) and suggests that Kali ig a throw of five that vanquishes all others. In the Chan, Up. IV, 1, 4 it is said 'as (in a game 1739 of dice ) all the lower throws are included in the Krta throw which becomes victorious, so to him (to Raikva ) comes ( the merit of all the good acte that people do'. Here Saṅkara explains that Kṛta is a throw of dice having four marks, while other throws that have three, two or one mark are called Trotā, Dvāpara and Kali respectively. The Mundaka Up. I. 2. 1 refers to Tretā 1740. 'This is the truth; the sacrificial rites which the sages saw in the mantras ( i. e. as presoribed in the hymns of the Rgveda and other vedas) have been performed in many ways in the Tretā! This last word is explained by Saṅkarācārya in two ways, first as referring to the threefold priestly duties (of hots, adhvaryu and udgātr ) which are based on the three Vedas and alternatively as refer ring to the Tretā age. From this resume it appears that even up to the times of the latest period of Vedic literature (i. e. Upaniṣads) the words Kļta, Tretā, Dvāpara and Kali were used in the sense of throws of dice in gambling and that it is very doubtful whether they were used in the sense of different ages of the world. Even in the Mahabharata Kṛta 1741 and Dvāpara are used also in the sense of throws of dice ( vide Virāta 50. 24). In the Gopatha Brāhmaṇa (I. 28 ) there is a reference to the beginning of the Dvāpara age. 

Even in the Vedānga Jyotisa1742 (of Rg.) the word yuga is used in the sense of a period of five years (pañcasamvatsaramayar

yugādhyaksam prajāpatim). The ancient Pitāmahasiddhanta which is not now extant, stated, according to the Pancasid dhāntikā of Varahamihira (XII. 1), that yuga means five years of the Sun and the Moon (raviśasinoh pañca 'yugam varṣāṇi Pitāmahopadiṣtāni). This sense of the word is still found in the Sabhāparva 11. 38. 

The Nirukta (I. 20) distinguishes between ancient sages and those of later days in the words, 1743 'the (ancient) sages had an intuitive perception of dharma and they imparted the Vedic mantras by instruction to later (sages) who had no intuitive perception of dharma'. But it does not mention or refer to any theory of four yugas. Both Gaut. I. 3-4 and Āp. Dh. S. II. 6. 13. 7-9 give expression to the view that among sages of old transgressions of dharma and violent actions are observed, but that on account of their distinguished spiritual greatness they incurred no sin, while a person of later days, being weak in spiritual merit, should not imitate them, otherwise he would come to grief. Here a distinction is drawn between very ancient sages and later sages as regards the endowment of spiritual merit, but nothing is said about the names or the theory of the four yugas. Āp. Dh. S. I. 2. 5. 4 further says 1744 that sages are not born among men of later days (avaresu) on account of the transgressions of religious ordinances (prevalent in later ages). Therefore, it would not be quite wrong to assume that the theory had not been fully developed even in the times of the early dharmasutras of Gaut. and Ap. even though both held that they were living in an age of decline and that sages coming after the authors of the mantras were inferior. 

Here epigraphic evidence affords some help in fixing the lower limit of the period when the theory of yugas must have been developed. 

In the Rock Edicts of Asoka No. 4 and No. 5 we have at Kalsi and two other places the words 'āva kapam' (yāvat kalpam) and at Girnar the words 'ava samvata kapa' which mean up to the end of the kalpa' or 'up to the end of the kalpa when the clouds or fires of destruction called samvarta

will arise * 1745. Vide C. I. I vol. I. pp. 8, 10, 30-33. This indi cates that the idea of a kalpa (a vast period of time at the end of which the universe would be dissolved) which is part of the theory of the yugas had been developed in the 3rd century B. C. The Junāgadh Inscription of Rudradāman 1746 (150 A.D.) refers to 'wind the velocity of which was as terrible as that at the end of the yuga'. In certain very early inscriptions of Pallava 1747 kings (of about the 3rd or 4th century A. D.) they are described as always ready to extricate dharma that had sunk deep owing to the evil effects of the Kali age'. In one of the Gupta Inscriptions dated in the 96th year of the Gupta era ( 415-16 A. D.) Dhruvaśarman is praised as following the path of righteous conduct which prevailed in Kṛtayuga, 1748 while the Chammak copperplate of the Vākātaka emperor Pravara gena II also speaks of Krtayuga (Gupta Inscriptions No. 55 p. 237 at p. 240). The Talgupda inscription of the early Kadamba king Kakusthavarman refers to Kaliyuga ( E. I, vol. VIII p. 34). It is not necessary to adduce passages from ins. criptions of a later date. From the above it may be said that the theory of yugas and kalpas had begun to take shape at least in the 4th or 3rd century B. C. and that in the first cen turies of the Christian era it had been fully developed. It must have gone through several stages in the course of its develop ment. For example, Brahmagupta (Brābmasphuṭa-siddhānta 

XI. 10) states that the theory of yugas, Manus and kalpas set out by Aryabhata was not like that of the smrtis. 

The same conclusion is arrived at from a consideration of the classical Sanskrit literature. The theory of yugas and manvantaras as detailed in the Mahābhārata (Vanaparva chap ters 149, 188, Santi chapters 69, 231-232), Manu chap. I, Viṣnu dharma-sūtra XX. 1-21, the Purāpas (such as Viṣnu I. 3, VI. 3, Mārkandeya 46, Brahma 229-230, Mateya 142-144) and, astro nomical writers from Brahmagupta is briefly as follows: Krta, Tretā, Dvāpara and Kali comprise together with the period

called sandhyā (that precedes each yuga) and the period call ed sandhyāṁsa ( that follows each yuga) 12000 years, i. e. Krta, Tretā, Dvāpara and Kali extend respectively over 4000, 3000, 2000, 1000 years and sandhya and sandhyamsa of these four extend over 400, 300, 200 and 100 years each (i. e. the sandhyā of Kṛta is 400 years and the sandhyāmśa of Krta is 400 years and so on). But these are divine years. Each divine year is equal to 360 human years. Therefore we have to multiply 12000 by 360 to arrive at the number of human years in the four yugas (i. e. the figure is 4320000). The Kṛtayuga with its sandhyā and sandhyāṁsa comes to 1728000 human years, Tretā to 1296000, Dvāpara to 864000 and Kali to 432000. These four yugas are together called sometimes caturyuga (Manu I. 71 ) or simply yuga algo ( Vanaparva 188. 27, Santi 232. 29 ); 1000 of these four yugas constitute a day of Brahmā, which is called Kalpa. The night of Brahmā is of the same duration. At the end of a kalpa the universe is resolved into Brahmā ( and this is called pralaya ) and at the end of Brahmā's night the world is created again. In one day of Brahmā there are 14 Manus and therefore each Manyantara is equal to about 71 caturyugas (1000 divided by 14). The life of Brahmā is 100, out of which half is gone and therefore the present is said to be the 2nd or latter half (dvitiya parārdha) of the life of Brahmā and at present the kalpa that is running is called Vārāha. From the above it will be seen that, according to the Purānas, the universe has been created and dissolved many times and there have been numerous Manyantaras also ( vide Manu I. 80). The four yugas in various ways differ in their characteristics. Kșta is 80 called because it is an age in which everything is fulfilled by every one and nothing is left to be done. 1749 The symbolic colours of the four yugas are respectively white, yellow, red and dark (Vanaparva 189. 32). In Kśta, Dharma prevails in all its perfection and it stands with all its four feet ( dharma being figuratively spoken of as vrṣa, 1750 a bull, in Manu VIII. 16 and Vanaparva 190. 9) and it declines or deteriorates by a quarter in each of the following yugas (Manu I. 81-82 

Santi 232. 23–24 ), so that in Kali only one quarter (or one foot) of dharma remains and adharma occupies three quarters. In Krta people are entirely free from diseases, secure all that

they desire and the length of human life is four hundred years, all of which decline by one quarter successively in the follow ing three yugas ( Manu I. 83=Sānti 232. 25 ). The dharmas in each of the four yugas are different ; tapas was the highest in Kyta, philosophic knowledge in Tretā, sacrifice in Dvāpara and charity alone in Kali (Manu I. 85-86 =Parāśara I. 22-23 

Santi 232. 27-28). Manu I. 85, Santi 232. 27 and 261. 8, Parāśara I. 22 all have the same verse stating that the dharmas prescribed for men in each yuga differ. 

In Kṛta, Tretā, Dyāpara and Kali the dharmas ( that should *be observed) are respectively declared by Manu, Gautama, Saṅkha-Likhita and Parāśara ( Parāśara I. 24). In Krta there was a single varna but at the end of Kali almost all will be śūdras (Brahma 229. 52, Matsya 144. 78). Parāśara (I. 25-28 ) points out other characteristics of the four yugas, which need not be detailed here. Manu IX. 301 and 30%, however, indicate that the yugas are not watertight parts of Time. It is the king who can by his conduct introduce the characteristics of one yuga into another. Medhātithi on Manu IX. 301 explains that the king should not be misled into thinking that Kali is a historical part of Time and that he ( the king ) cannot therefore be Kali or Kṛta, but that it is the king's way of conducting himself that will produce the conditions of the several yugas among his people. 

In Vanaparva 149. 11-38, Vāyu 32 and 57-58, Linga 39, Matsya 142-144, Garuda 223, Nāradapurāṇa (pūrvārdha 41 ) and in several other purāṇas there are descriptions of the nature of the four yugas, which are passed over here. But it is important to see how the Great Epic and the Purānas describe the nature of Kaliyuga. Vanaparva chap. 188 and 190, the Yugapurāna chapter of the Gargasamhitā (published in the J. B. O. R. 8. vol. 14 pp. 400 ff, by K. P.

The dates of the composition of the Purānas not being beyond controversy, it would be difficult to point to a particular period as the time when the full-fledged theory of the yugas was developed. But this much can be stated with certainty that by the 4th century A. D. at the latest the theory had been completely doveloped. Āryabhata 1755 (in Kālakriyāpāda 10 ) states that when three pādas of the yuga ( i. e. Krta, Treta and Dvāpara ) and 3600 years more had elapsed, he was 23 years old' i. e. (accepting the calculations current at present) in 499 A. D. Āryābhata was 23 years old and so was born in 476 A. D. In his Pancasiddhāntikā Varāhamihira 1756 (505 to 587 A. D.) summarises the data of several astronomical 

1754. It would be interesting to compare the descriptions of Kali given in the Mahābhārata and the several Puranas. Some verses are com. mon to several of them and the ideas are almost the same throughout. The principal counts in the indictment are that there will be sūdra and Mleccha kings, that heretical sects will predominate, that the ordered duties and privileges of the several castes will be turned topsyturvy and there will be great physical and moral decline. After Vanaparva chap. 188 there is an additional description in chap. 190 of what will happen in the Kali age, which appears, from the express words of Vanaparva 191, 16, to have been taken from the Vāyupurāna. So this chapter is a later interpolation. The verse EIGT &c. occurs agaio in Vanaparva 190. 52 and also in Harivansa (Bhavisyaparva 3. 12), Brahmapurāṇa 230. 11. Matsya 47. 258

The 2nd says that the earth will be covered with edifices enshrining bones (of Buddha) and not with temples of gods. The idea about girls of 5, 6 and 7 being mothers occurs in Viṣnupurāṇa VI. 1. 41-42, Brahma 229, 41-42, Nāradiya Purvārdha 41. 64 and elsewhere.

Siddhāntas of which Romaka is one, about which Brahmagupta remarks that the Romaka siddhanta is outside the pale of smṛtis because 1757 it omits all mention of yugas, manvantaras and kalpas that have been regarded by the smrtis as useful in measuring time. Kalidasa 1758 in Raghuvamsa 15. 96 speaks of dharma as having only three feet ( in Tretā ) when Rāma made up his mind to depart from this world. No scholar will assign to Kālidāsa a date later than the middle of the 5th century A. D. Therefore the theory of yugas must be deemed to have been perfected long before 400 A. D. K. P, Jayaswal holds that the Yugapurāṇa chapter of the Garga-samhitā was composed about 50 B, C. (J. B.O.R.S. vol. 14 p. 399 ) and he is probably right. 

At present it is the practice to hold Kali 5046 (expired) as equal to 1945 A. D. or śake 1867 or saivat 2001-2. But it appears that there were several views about the date of the beginning of the Kaliyuga. The exact starting point on the above computa tion was Friday, 18th February 3102 B. C. One view was that Kaliyuga was about to begin when the great Mahābhārata war was fought out. 1759 This view is expressed in the Aihole Inscription which appears to equate the beginning of Kali with the Bhārata war and states that 3735years ( expired) from the Bhārata war are equal to 556 years of the saka era, 1760 Arya bhata know this computation, since he says that he was 23 years old when three parts of the ( great) yuga and 3600 had elapsed ( Kāla-kriyāpāda, verse 10). Another view set forth in the Purāṇas is that Kaliyuga began when Kșsna finished his avatāru and went to heaven, 1761 This would put the beginning

of Kaliyuga several years after the date arrived at on the first view. 1762 Vide Mausalapatya chap. 1. 13 and 2. 20 for reference to the lapse of 36 years before Krsna's passing away. The Yugapurāṇa appears to make Kaliyuga start, on the day Draupadi died ( vide J. B. 0. R. S. vol. 14 p. 400 ). Another view is that of Varāhamihira who says that the constellation of the Great Bear was in Maghā when Yudhisthira was on the throne and that that time is arrived at by adding 2526 years to the saka year. 1963 This would place Yudhisthira in 653 of the Kali age (as calculated at present) and not at the end of Dvāpara and the beginning of Kali. The Rājatarangipi I. 56 quotes the Brhat-sanhitā and holds that Kurus and Pandayas flourished in 653 of the Kali yuga ( I. 51). Great efforts have

Raja Rao in the Bulletin of the Ganganath Jha Research Society, vol. II pp. 125-143, which mentions numerous dates suggested by various scholars. I am not at all convinced of the correctness of Dr. Triveda's conclusions, in spite of the great learning that be brings to bear on the problem. Vide also his paper in 'Bharatiya Vidya', vol. VI (1945), pp. 117-120.

In 13, 2 Varāhamihira promises that he will dilate on the movements of the seven sages (municāra) according to the opinion of Vrddhagarga. It appears that 13.3 is his own verse. Garga held the opinion that the Great Bear remained in one constellation for one hundred years. That is all, Utpala quotes the verse of Garga, but it is in the Agustubh metre. It was believed by the authors of the Puranas and even by such astronomers as Varāhamihira that the constellation of the Great Bear remained in each naksatra for a hundred years. Vide Br. Sam. 13.4, Bhāgavata XII. 2. 27-28, Matsya 273. 40-44, Vāyu 99. 421-422, Viṣnu IV. 24. 33. Mr. Velandi Gopal Aiyer in .Chronology of Ancient India' (p.75) holds that 'sad-dvika. paāca dvi' means 26 times 25 i. e. 650 years and that we should read

Sam. 13. 3 in order to correct the error of one mātrā in the 4th quarter of the verso, In this last he is in error; he forgets that, according to works on chanda-, Sastra, a short syllable at the end of a pāda is deemed to be prosodially long (and therefore the last syllable in Bṛ.

been made by several scholars to meet this discrepancy by explaining the word 'sad-dvika-pañca-dviyutaḥ'( in the Brhat samhita) in various fanciful ways, which are far from satisfactory. There is no reason why dvika should not straightforwardly be taken in the sense of 'two!, 1764 as the Lilāvati and Br. Sam. 71. 5 itself do. 

It is difficult to believe that the Sakakāla referred to in that verse is different from the Sakendrakāla or Sakbhūpakāla, which the Pancasiddhantika (I. 8) and the Bșhat-samhita ( 8. 20-21) make use of in several places. At least Varābamihira gives no such indication, Mr. C. V. Vaidya in his 'Maha bhārata, a criticism' pp. 80-81 holds that the Sakakāla referred to in the verse asan maghāsu &c.' is the era of Buddha's Nirvāṇa. There is hardly any warrant for this assumption, His interpretation of 'sad-dyika-panca-dviyutaḥ as meaning 2566 (and not 2526 ) is not bad and does not seriously affect the argument about the date of Yudhisthira. On that interpretation Yudhisthira would be placed in 2488 B. C. (instead of in 2448 B. C.). But there is no reason why the usual values of sat (six ), dvika ( two ) and other words should not be understood to be meant here, 

The data contained in the Nidhanpur plates of Bhaskara varman (E. I. vol. XII p. 65), when properly scrutinized, appear to favour the position of Varāhamihirā. Those plates in sett ing out the genealogy of Bhāskaravarman start with Naraka, whose son Bhagadatta fought on the side of the Kauravas in the Mahabharata war and was killed by Arjuna (vide Droṇa-, parva chap. 29). Bhagadatta's son is said to have been Vajra. datta. After Vajradatta his descendants ruled over Kāmarūpa for 3000 years and then Puṣyavarman, a scion of the Bhaga datta family, became king of Kamarūpa. King Bhāgkara Varman was 12th from Puṣyavarman and was a contemporary of Emperor Harsa ( first half of the 7th century A. D.). Taking an average of 20 years for the reign of each ruler, Puṣyavarman should be taken as having flourished about the beginning of the 5th century A, D. Adding 3000 years which are alleged by: the plates to have intervened between Puṣyavarman and Vajra datta, we arrive at about 2500 B, C, as the time of Vajradatta and therefore approximately of the Mahabharata war. This

Date of the beginning of Kaliyuga

corresponds rather very closely with the statement of Varaha mihira who puts Yudhiṣthira's reign at 653 Kaliyuga (i. e. 2448 B. C.). On the other hand, if we assume that the Mahā bhārata war was fought in or that Kaliyuga started in 3101 B. C., then Puṣyavarman who flourished 3000 years after the Mahābhārata war would have to be placed about 101 B. C. and there will be an interval of about 700 or 750 years between Pusyawarman and Bhāskaravarman. A period of 700 or 750 years for 12 rulers would work at about 60 years for each ruler, which is a very improbable average. Therefore the Nidhanpur plates do not support the hypothesis that the Mahābhārata war was fought about 3101 B, C., but rather support the statement of Varāhamihira that it was fought about 2500 B. C. 

. Another epoch for the Mahābhārata war and the beginning of Kaliyuga is indicated by some passages of historic impor tance found in some of the Purāṇas. The Vāyupurāna (99, 4-15) and the Matsyapurana ( 273, 36 ) say that from the birth of Parikṣit to the coronation of Mahāpadma (Nanda) a period of 1050 years elapsed, while the Bhagavata XII. 2. 26 assigns 1015 years for the same. There is some mistake in the Purana texts here. The Matsya ( in chap. 271. 17-30 ) enumerates the kings of the Bārhadratha dynasty of Magadha descended from Sahadeva, son of Jarāsandha, and states that the dynasty will rule (i. e, ruled) for a thousand years. Then chap. 272 (verses 1-5) speaks of five kings, who will be followed by the Siśunāka dynasty, that together reigned for 360 years and the last king in which was Mahānandi ( verses 6-13 ) whose son from a sūdra wife was Mahāpadma ( 272. 18). So if the years of these three dynasties are added we get the period of about 1500 years. This is supported by the Bhāgavatapurāṇa (IX, 22. 48 and XII. 1-2) and Vāyupurana ( 99. 308-321), which latter says that 32 kings of the Bārhadratha dynasty will rule for 1000, then five Vitihotra kings for 138 years (Pradyota and others ) and then the Saiśunāka (Sisunāga in the Bhagavata and in the Brabmānda purāṇa III. 74. 134-135 ) dynasty for 362 (in all exactly 1500 years ). The same periods are given by the Viṣṇupurāṇa (IV. 23 and 24 ) and by the Brahmāṇdapurāna III. 74. 121-135. ŚrIdhara in his comment on Bhagavata XII. 2. 26 states that the interval between Parīkṣit and Nanda is 1498 as the Bhagavata holds that the Saiśunāga dynasty ruled for 360 years (XII. 1.4-6). Therefore the proper reading in the Vayupurana or Matsyapurāṇa or the Bhagavata should be 'pañcasatottaran' 

goo 

History of Pharmatūstrā . i Vol. 

instead of 'pañcāsaduttaram' or ' pañcadasottaram.' Taking the interval between Parikṣit and Nanda to be 1500 years and holding as most modern scholars do that the Nandas flourished in the 4th century B. O., Pariksit, the grandson of Arjuna, the Mahābhārata war and the beginning of Kaliyuga would have to be placed in the 19th century B.O. Therefore there are so far three main different epochs for the Mahābhārata war viz. 3101 B, O., 2448 B, O. and about 1900 B. O. All the three are well attested by evidence dating at least from about the 5th century A. D. One cannot dogmatically say that a certain tradition alone out of these three is the only correct one. All that one can say is that one prefers a particular tradition to the other two. Since the epoch of 1900 B, C. is supported by the Puranas in great detail by citing the names of the several kings and their regnal years I personally regard the epoch of 1900 B. O. for the Mabā bharata war as more probable than the other two. It is best to acknowledge one's inability to assign a certain date to the Mahābhārata war rather than twist plain words or ignore al together inconvenient passages or put on them fanciful or far fetched interpretations. The first desideratum is to prepare critical editions of the important purkṇas from the best mgs. material. Even then it is doubtful whether unanimity among scholars can be secured. A scholarly beginning was made by Pargiter in his book " The Purāṇa texts of the dynasties of the Kali Age' (1913). He compares the material available in the printed editions of several Purānas and Msg, on the subject of royal dynasties. One cannot or may not agree with many of the assumptions and inferences that he makes or draws, yet one cannot withhold admiration for his industry and method. For example, I cannot agree with him when he takes 'bhavisye kathitān' of the Matsyapurana or bhavisye pathitān' of Vāyu ( 99. 267 ) as referring to the Bhaviṣyapurāṇa. In many passages of the Puranas we have references to 'bhaviṣyajña'(Brahmānda III. 74, 105), which simply means 'those who are conversant with sections on the future 'contained in ancient works like the Mahabharata. 

It is not possible owing to limitations of space to enter into detailed examination of the theories of several scholars about the date of the Mahābhārata war. But one or two important matters will have to be referred to here. 

Mr. Velandi Gopala Aiyer in 'The chronology of Ancient India in chap. II. (pp. 51-104 ) examines the astronomical data

furnished by the Mahābhārata and relying on the far-fetched and wrong interpretation put by him on the words of the Bṛhat samhita ( quoted above) and on the fact that the Kollam era in Malabar appears to take 1177 B.O. as the starting point for Kaliyuga arrives at the conclusion that the Mahābhārata war took place in the latter part of 1194 B. C. This theory goes against all the three other starting points which are supported by comparatively ancient and authoritative evidence. 

The information derived from the fragments of the work of Megasthenes on India are supposed to shed some light on this vexed problem. In one fragment (p. 115 of Ancient India as described by Megasthenes &c.') occurs the passage : 'From him (i. e. Bacchus ) to Alexander the Great 6451 years are reckoned with three months additional, the calculation being made by counting the kings that reigned in the inter mediate period to the number of 153'. An extract from Pliny makes out the number of kings to be 154. As against this we have the statement in the 'Indika' of Arrian (2nd century A. D., translated by McCrindle, p. 203): From the time of Dionysos to Sandrakottus, the Indians counted 153 kings and a period of 6042 years, but among these a republic was thrice established ...... another to 300 years and another to 120 years. The Indians also tell us that Dionysos was earlier than Heracles by fifteen generations and that except him no one made a hostile invasion of India. This passage is of very great im portance for one reason, viz. that it proves that in the 4th century B. C. there was a persistent Indian tradition which carried back Indian civilization and ordered government to 6000 years before the 4th century B. O. But there is great doubt as to what Megasthenes actually wrote and there is some divergence as to the number of years and kings also. Besides, this has no direct bearing on the date of the Mahābhārata war or the beginning of Kaliyuga, unless Heracles is taken to be Hari-Krṣpa, as some scholars 1765 do. The account of Heracles (pp. 201-203 of McCrindle's work ) agrees in some respects with the legends about Krṣpa viz. that he was honoured by the Sourasenoi ( Sūrasenas), an Indian tribe who possegs two large 

1765. Vide Mr. C. V. Vaidya's 'Mabābhārata, a criticism' pp. 75–76, where ignoring the figures of total years (viz. 6042 or 6451) he comes to the conclusion that Krsna flourished about 3101 B, C. since 138 Kings between Heracles and Sandrakottus (i. e. Candragupta) may have ruled in all about 2760 years, taking 20 years as the average for each reign,902

cities Methora (Mathura) and Cleisobora and that Heracles had many wives; but then there are other anecdotes about Heracles which do not at all agree viz. his having a daughter Pandaia with whom when she was only seven Heracles had intercourse for raising a mighty race, Here there is some confus ion with the Pandavas and Kunti or with the Pandyan kingdom in the South. Moreover, 6000 years for 153 or 154 kings is rather a very long period. It cannot be said that a king is only a unit of time in these computations ( 40 years on an average), since such Purāṇas as the Vāgu and the Matsya expressly mention the number of years that each dynasty held sway, the number of kings belonging to each dynastly and the lengths of the reigns of several kings. It is no doubt true that the details of the names of the several kings, the number of kings and the duration of their reigns do not always tally. It appears that the Purānas that contain historical material were recast at diffe rent times, e. g. the Vāyupurāṇa ( 99. 383 ) refers to the Guptas while the Matsyapurāna is silent about them. The extant Puranas cannot be supposed to have given imaginary details about historical dynasties, but they must have had before them older records or traditions. The Purapas do not appear to have invented names of new kings or given imaginary lengths of reigns. The authors surely knew that the total of the several dynasties between Parikṣit and Nanda did not square with the total of the lengths of the reigns of the several individual kings. But they gave both these without trying to solve the discrepancies as they wanted to record all the traditions they had got before them. The Purānas have a claim on our attention, but in the present state of our knowledge they cannot unfortunately form the basis of any certain or connected history and chronology of ancient times. 

A few words may here be said about the attempts made to deduce the age of the Mahābhārata war from the astronomical references in the Epic. 

The number of works and papers in which the dates of the Bharata war and of Kaliyuga are discussed is very large. A few of them only are noted here. The late Shankar Balkrishna Dikshit in his exhaustive volume on the History of Indian Astronomy' (in Marathi, 2nd ed. of 1931 ) deals with this subject at pp. 107 127. Mr. C.V. Vaidya in ‘Mahabharata, a criticism, 1904 'devotes one chapter (pp. 55–78) and appendix note V (pp. 180–190) to the date of the Mahabharata war. He holds fast to the traditional

view that the Mahabhārata war was fought in 3101 B, C, Mr. N. Jagannatha Rao writes a book on the Age of the Mahābhārata war' (Bezwada, 1931), in which he disputes the identity of Candragupta Maurya with Sandracottus mentioned by Megasthenes, holds that Sandracottus is the Gupta Emperor Candragupta, that the date of Candragupta Maurya would be about 1535 B. C., that the word 'Sakakāla ' in the Bphatsambitā refers really to the era of the Persian Emperor Cyrus about 550 B. C. and that the Great War was fought in 3139 B. C. The work does not go deeply into anything and is rather superficial. There is a lengthy and interesting article by Mr. K. G. Saṅkar on some problems of Indian Chronology' in Annals of the B.O.R. Institute, Poona, vol. XII pp. 301-361 in which he seems to favour 1198 B. O. as the date of the Mahābhārata war. Mr. J. S. Karandikar, editor of the 'Kesari' (Poona), contribut ed certain articles (in Marathi) which are now issued as a booklet (1939), in which he examines many of the astronomical references in the Mahābhārata and the Paurānic lists about the dynasties of ancient Indian kings and arrives at the conclu sion that the Mahābhārata war was fought in 1931 B. C. Though I differ from him in important details, I think that the date arrived at by him appears to be one of the two probable or best authenticated dates among the several dates proposed by various scholars. Prof. P. C. Sen-Gupta contributed a paper to the Journal of the Bengal Asiatic Society in 1937, vol. III pp. 101-119, in which he discusses the date of the Mahabharata war and arrives at the conclusion that the Bhārata war was fought about 2449 B. C. This also is a very probable date and has the authority of the tradition mentioned in the Bșhatsamhitā that the saka era is 2526 years after the era of Yuddhisthira. In J. A. S. B. for 1938, vol. IV pp. 393-413 Prof. Sen-Gupta again examines 

Bhārata battle traditions and confirms the date 2449 B. C. already arrived at by him. Dr. K. L. Daftari delivered some lectures in the University of Nagpur on the astronomical method and its application to the chronology of Ancient India' which are published in book form (Nagpur, 1942 ). This work exhaustively deals with almost all the passages of astronomical importance contained in the Mahābhārata and is characterized by great industry, patient calculations and ingenious explana tions of conflicting passages. His conclusion is that the Bharata war was fought in 1197 B. O. Although one feels nothing but admiration for the author's great learning and acumen, it is not possible to agree with the date arrived at by him or with 

904

[ Voli 

the method and theories adopted by him. Apart from details one cannot accede to the following theories propounded by him viz. his division of the astronomical references into two groups, his assumption that a passage in the Dronaparva (chap. 184) about the rising of the moon at about 2 A. M. is an interpolation ( because it does not square with his explanations of the other passages ), his bold expedient of changing * citrām' to caitām' in Bhiṣma 3. 1% and his transposition of Sravana and Puṣya in Salyaparva 34. 6, his taking'angāraka' to mean Venus (and not Mars). Dr. Daftari's work was reviewed by Prof. Sen-Gupta in JASB for 1943, vol. IX pp. 221-228 and after submitting it to a searching analysis and calculations, the learned Professor arrives at the conclusion that he cannot accept Dr. Daftari's method, which is useless for all practical purposes. Prof. K. V. Abhyankar contributes an article to the Annals of B.O. R. I. for 1914, vol. XXV. pp. 116-136 on the date and time of the Bhārata war', in which he takes into account only the material available in the Epic itself and bases his conclusions 'on the principle of following the voice of the majority. He furnishes a useful table in an appendix that shows at a glance some of the important astronomical passages of the Mabābhārata with their interpretations given by the commentators Arjuna miśra and Nilakantha and by Mr. Karandikar and himself and finally gives his opinion that the traditional view of the date (3101 B. c. ) is approximately correct. It appears that he had not, when he wrote the article, the work of Dr. Daftari before him nor Prof, Sen-Gupta's devastating criticism of it. It will be apparent from the above that the attempts to settle the exact date of the Mahābhārata war on the strength of the astronomical materials contained therein are dismal failures. Hardly any two scholars agree on the exact dates so arrived at, which range from 1193 B. C. to 3101 B. C. and even beyond. There are many reasons for this disappointing result. In the first place, several of the criteria mentioned in the epic are hopelessly inconsistent, as will be made clear a little below by a few-examples. Further, several scholars assume that thefepio was composed within a short time (about three years arcording to Adiparva, 62,52,or.ed.chap. 56. 32 ) after the war. Many (including my humble self ) cannot subscribe to this view. Besides, we are totally in the dark about the details of the system of the calendar generally adopted at the period of the war. Many suppose that it largely resembled the rules contained in the Vedānga Jyotiga ( of the Rgveda ). There is no unanimity on the question whether the months.

onded with amāvāsyū (i. e. whether they were amanta) or wliether they ended with Full Moon (i. e. whether they were pūrnimānta ). 176 That a pūrnimānta month was in vogue in Vedic times is beyond dispute. For example, Tai. 8. states that Pūrva Phaigunt is the last night of the year and Uttarā Phalgunl is the mouth (i. e. beginning). Similarly Tai. S. VII. 4. 8.2 declares that the citrāpūrnamāsa is the mouth of the year; while San. Br. IV. 4 declares that the Phālguni Paurṇa māsl is the mukha of the year. The author or authors of the Mahābhārata, in describing the evil portents of an impending tragic or catastrophic event, often assemble together (as in Udyoga 143.5-29, Bhiṣme 2. 16-33 ) all of them irrespective of the fact whether some of them are possible in the very order of nature. For example, it is stated that Arundhati wont before Vasiṣtha ( Bhiṣma 2. 31 ), that a mare gave birth to a cow calf and that a bitch gave birth to a jackal ( Bhiṣma 3. 6 ) and that images of gods trembled, laughed and vomited blood (Bhiṣma %. 26, which may be compared with Brhatsamhitā 45. 8 and the verses of Garga quoted by Utpala thereon); it is several times said that the Moon and the Sun are seized (i, e, eclipsed) at an unusual season (aparvani ) or simultaneously by Rāhu (vide 

1766. That the months in North-west Iğdia were pūrṇimānta in the Kharostbi records drawn up in Kaniṣka's era is shown in E. I. vol. 18 p. 266 and E. I. vol. 19 at p. 10. Aparārka (p. 423 ) quotes a verse from TIOT **** orqat a ri faa fa and remarks that Bhādrapada dark half is in that verse said to be the dark half of Aśvina. In the Bhavisya purana (Uttara-parva, chap. 132. 17) the Full Moon of Phālguna is said to be the end of the month' (foto Fregatura coafat gra I Fiat 

vai ra TTÀ gigt). In the Matsyapurāna ( 159. 4-6) it is said that Skanda and Visakha were born on the 15th of the dark half of Caitra, that to the bright half of Caitra itself on the 5th Iadra made one boy out of the two and on the 6th crowned him as Lord. This shows that in the Matsya Caitra was fūrgimanta and not amānta. When the month is pūrnimānta, the first fortnigbt ending with amāvāsyā is assigned to a month which is one month in advance of the amanta reckoning i. e. what is Kārtika dark hall with amanta reckoning becomes Mārgasīrsa dark half with the pārgi. mānta reckoning. On Jai. VI. 5. 31 Sabara quotes a Vedic passage about गवामयन 'पुरस्तारपोर्णमास्याश्चतुरहे दीक्षेरन् । तमुख वैषा पौर्णमासी संवत्सरस्य या चैत्री ahoraret', which seems to indicate that the year began with the Full Moon of Caitra and that the pūrnimānta reckoning was not unknown,

History of Dharmasāstra 

(Vol. 

Bhiṣmaparva 3.28 and 32-33 and Āśvamedhikaparva 77.15 ). 1767 Further, these very verses state that the eclipses of the Sun and the Moon took place on the same day and on the 13th and in the same month. Dr. Daftari interprets 'ekāhnā 'as mean ing on the same week-day and' on the 13th tithi' (pp. 5-6 of his work ) caloulated according to the wrong method of those days. It is extremely doubtful whether week-days had been known or named at the time of the Bhārata war or even at the time of the composition of the Epic. It is too much to assuine that the astronomers of the Mahabharata war days, while they could predict eclipses and state accurately the position of the planets, were so clumsy as to allow a mistake of two tithis to occur in their calendar with respect to the occurrence of a solar eclipse. The words in Bhiṣmaparva 3. 28 and 32-33 appear to be a mere exaggerated statement of portents. If real observed eclipses are meant they would have to be taken in the order of the words in the text, viz. first an eclipse of the Moon (on Kārtika paurpima ) and then an eclipse of the Sun ( on Kārtika amāvāsya ) and further it must be assumed that the dark half of Kartika contained only 13 days. Dr. Daftari (pp. 44-46 of his work ) holds that first there was a solar eclipse on Aśvina amāvāsyā, then a lunar eclipse and then again a solar eclipse. In that case we should expect the order to be 'sūrya-candrau' and not 'candragūryau'. Besides, hardly any other scholar holds that there were three eclipses one after another. There fore, it is hardly possible to say with certainty that the author accurately states astronomical facts observed by him or even traditionally handed down as definite facts and does not draw on his own imagination about the portents or does not exaggerate 

1767. चमवावुभौ यसो एकाला हि योदशीम्। अपर्वणि ग्रह यातौ प्रजासंक्षय मिच्छतः ॥ चन्मपर्यावुभौ मस्सो एकमासी प्रयोदशीम् । अपर्वणि ग्रहेणैतौ प्रजाः संक्षप furua: a POATE 328, 32. The cr. edition of the Mahābhārata gives oply the first of these two verses. Utpala in his com. on Bphatsambitā 5. 26 reads एकमासे त्रयोदशे. The words प्रजाः संक्षपयिन्यतः make it quite clear that eclipses and the fortnight of thirteen tithis are taken as very evil omens. Similar words occur in Bhiama 3, 12 and 13 quoted below in note 1779. In: Bșhatsamhita 3, 6 it is said that a graha called Tvaṣtr makes the orb of the Sun look dark even when there is ao parva (amāvāsyā). Utpala quotes on the same a verse of Parisara surat per MT MET * FRETE: I guta TAIFA: Forum H. There is no doubt whatever that the writer of Bhisma 2 and 3 is more concerned with chronicling evil omeas than with setting out accurate astronomical and other data observed by him personally or ovon by others. 

til Åstronomical data in Mahabhārata 907 

as a rhetorical device. In Bṭhatsaṁhita 5. 26, 97-98 Varaha mihira states the evil consequences if a moon eclipse precedes or follows a sun eclipse in the period of one fortnight. 

Most of the important astronomical details will now be set out from the time when Lord Krsna is said to have started as a peace-maker to the Kauravas. In Udyogaparva 83, 6-71768 it is said that Krsna started in the month of Kārtika (Kaumude māsi) at the end of the farad season and about the advent of winter, when the moon was in Revati nakṣatra and on maitra muhurta. Asyina and Kārtika are at present said to form the season of sarad, and Mārgasirṣa and Pausa form hemanta. This verse itself presents a difficulty. On the Full Moon day of Kārtika, the moon is in Krttikā nakṣatra and the moon would be in Revati three days before i. e. on or about the 12th of the bright half of Kārtika. If we take this along with the words ‘at the end of sarad' it follows that the month was pūrnimānta ; otherwise (i. e. if the month were amūnta) it would be highly improper to say that the 12th of the bright half of Kārtika was at the end of Sarad. After Krsna failed in his mission he returned to the Pāṇdavas ( for all of which we must allow a few days after the 12th of Kārtika sukla) and reported what Duryodhana and he himself said. Two of the statements reported by him are very material. Duryodhana said to his allies': March towards Kuruksetra (for battle); to-day the moon is (in) Pusya nakṣatra '. 1769 If Krsna started on his mission when the moon was in Revati ( on the 12th of the bright half of Kārtika ), then these above words must have been uttered in his presence on or about the 5th of the dark half of Kartika ( or of Mārga. śirṣa if the month was pūrpimānta ). Another important state. ment is that Krspa in his conversation with Karna ( whom he had tried to win over ) stated to him: 'this is a mild month in 

1768. मैत्रे मुर्ते संपाने साधषि विधाकरे। कौमुदे मासि रेवत्या शरदन्ते हिमागमे । gotto 83. 6–7, 15 mubūrtas of the day and 15 of the night are referred to even in the po or X, 4. 2. 18, 25, 27 and the trattaro (III. 10. 1.1) mentione the names of the 15 mubūrtas of the day (such as Citra, Ketu &c.). In the Kumārasambhava VII. 6 the maitra mubūrta is mentioned in connection with ceremonies preceding marriage. The commentators explain maitra as the 3rd mubūrta after sunrise. In the Atharva Jyotisa fifteen muhūrtas of the day are enumerated of wbich the first three are Raudra, Sveta and Maltra.

which fodder and fuel oan be easily had, which is neither too hot nor too cold; on the 7th day (from today ) there will be amāvāsyā; battle may be joined on that day; they regard it as having Indra for its ( guardian )1770 deity'. Therefore this must have been said on or about the 8th of the dark half of the month. But what was the name of the month? If the reckon ing was pārṇimānta, the month must be Mārgasirṣa, but if the reckoning was amānta, the month must be Kārtika. The words 'this month' taken along with Udyoga 83, 6–7 would indicate that the month meant was Kārtika. Further, Indra was the deity of Jyesthā naksatra and the amavasya ( as stated in Udyoga 142. 16-18) had Jyesthā nakṣatra. In modern times this is possible on Kārtika Amāvāsya, while there cannot be Jyesthā naksatra in modern times on Mārgasirsa amāvāṣya, but only on or about the 13th of the dark half of it. But this passage itself (Udyoga 142. 16-18) is in conflict with Salya 35. 10 where Krspa says: 'the Kauravas do not act up to my words, being driven to do so by the Time Spirit; 01 descendants of Pāṇdu, go out (for battle ) together with me when the moon is in Pusya'. If the moon was in Jyestha on amāvāsya when Krsna had proposed to Karna that the war should be begun, this passage of Salyaparva would put the beginning of the war 16 or 17 days after Kārtika amāvāsyā, which is not war ranted by any other passage and which no scholar puts forward. In Udyoga 143. 11 it is stated, 1771 "the spot on the moon has turned away ( disappeared) and Rahu approaches the Sun.' The exact meaning of the first quarter is not quite clear. Some interpret it to mean that 'an eclipse of the Moon has already taken place'. The moon looks beautiful with the spot thereon (compāre Sakuntala I ' malinamapi himõisor lakṣma lakṣmim tanoti). The disappearance of the spot might have been looked upon as an evil portent. Even supposing that the first quarter refers to an eclipse of the moon, it does not matter much. The second quarter states that an eclipse of the Sun was expected when Karṇa addressed these words to Krspa, the envoy of the

Papdavas. Later on in Bhisma 2.23 it is stated 1772 that the Moon had become devoid of brightness, was without its spot on the Full moon day of Kārtika and assumed the colour of fire while the sky retained its original hue; so that if there was an eclipse of the moon it was on Kārlika Paurnimā and an eclipse of the sun was yet to take place. On the whole, therefore, one may assume, though not without hesitation, that the months were amanta, that possibly there was an eclipse of the moon on Kārtika Full Moon when Krsna had gone as a peace-maker and that there was a solar eclipse on the amāvāsya of Kartika just about the time the war began, In Salyaparva 56. 10 we again meet with the words ( at the beginning of the mace duel) 'Rahu swallowed the Sun at an unusual season'. This passage and Aśvamedhika 77. 15 ( Rabur-agrasadadityam yugapat soma meva ca) rather suggest that the eclipse of the sun at an unusual time had become a stock example of an evil portent without the actual occurrence thereof. The words in Salyaparva refer to the last day of the war before the mace duel between Duryodhana and Bhima and the passage says that Rahu seized the sun and there was an earth-quake also. Hardly any one (except Dr. Daftari) holds that there was another eclipse on the last day of the war, when just before the war there already had been an eclipse on Kartika amāvāsyā. 

As to the exact tithi and naksatra on which the Great War began, there are many conflicting statements. In the Bhārata dāvitri it is stated that the Bhārata war started in the first month (i. e. Mārgasirṣa ) of Hemanta on the 13th of the bright half when the moon was in the nakṣatra presided over by Yama (1. e. Bharani ) 1773. The Bhārata-sāvitri is no part of the

The following verses of the perfitoft are material for the days of the important events of the war: 'ART QUA RIĦ UPT Tirasit मासं भारतं युदं नक्षत्रं यमदेवतम् ॥ फाल्गुन्यो निहतो भीष्मः ष्णपक्षे च ससमी । अष्ठम्यो चेष सौभद्रो नाम्पा व जयद्रथः । दशम्यो भगवत महायुद्धे निपातितः । एकादश्यामर्धरात्री हतो पीरो घटोत्कचः। ततः प्रभातसमये विरादनुपदो हतो। बादश्यां चैव मध्याहे वोणाचार्यो रणे इतःप्रयोदश्या तु मध्यावषसेनो निपातितः पितुर्दश्यां तु पूर्ण रणे दु:शासनोहतः । ...

Mahabhārata, yet it has some traditional value, being probably earlier than all the commentators of the Mahabharata and later than the text of Sauti. In conflict with this passage of the Bhāratasāvitrī we have the words of Udyoga 142. 18 ( quoted above ) where Krṣṇa says to Karpa that battle may be joined on amā vāsyā when the moon is in Jyesthā. The Mahābhārata itself states that after the disposition of the vast armies were made and commanders were appointed, Duryodhana called Ulūka and sent him to the Pandavas to inflame their feelings with the words 1774 (Udyoga 160. 93 ) 'the worship of steel ( weapons ) has been performed, the site of Kurukṣetra is dried up (has no mud), your horses are well fed, warriors are hired by you; fight tomorrow. This Lohābhihāra (orgāra ) is the game as the rite of nirājanā ( according to the Amarakośa ) or is performed immediately after nirājanā (for which see pp. 230-231 above). Kautilya (IL. 30 p. 135) prescribes a nīrājanā rite at the start of an invasion and when two seasons meet. So a nfrājanā rite on Kārtika amāvāsya would be most appropriate (both because a battle was to be begun and because at the end of Kārtika the season of Sarad ended). The Bṛhatsamhita ( 43. 1-2) prescribes a nfrājana rite for horses, elephants and men on the 8th or 12th of Kārtika bright half or on the 15th of Kartika (Full Moon or amāvāsyā).

whether Mr. Karandikar is right in saying that Lohābhihara (or-sāra ) refers to Skandaṣaṣth1. In the first place, the worship of weapons can be done at any time,' particularly when a battle is to be commenced. In the second place, it is not necessary to postulate the lapse of six days and more for the sending of Ulūka and his return from the time when Krspa said that battle may be begun on amāvāsyā. The armies had taken up opposite positions on the field of Kurukṣetra and Ulūka could have come and gone in a day or two. Further, we have no evidence that Skanda-sasthi was performed in northern India in Mārgasirṣa, though very late works composed by dākṣinātyas like the Nirnayasindhu say that Skandaṣasthi is the same as Campaṣasthi in Maharastra and is observed on the 6th of Mārgasirsa. Raghunandana quoting Devipurāṇa places Skandasasthi on Caitra 6th of the bright half and is supported by the Matsyapurāṇa quoted above in n.1766. There is no reason why the actual fight should commence so late as the 13th day of Mārgasirṣa (or even 11th as Mr. Karandikar suggests ) when Krsna said that it should be joined on amāvāsyā. It is quite possible that the war began on or about Kartika amāvāsyā. The observance of. 'lohābhihāra' does not lead to the certain inference that the war was not begun till several days after the 6th of the bright half of Mārgasirṣa. Similarly, Mr. Karandi kar says that the moon is ordinarily in Bharani on the 11th or 12th of the bright half of Mārgaśirṣa. It may be so. But it is possible to have the moon in Bharaṇl even on the 13th. I am inclined to hold that the Bhāratasāvitri dates of the beginning of the war embody a different tradition altogether from the one contained in the Mahābhārata itself. The Bhāratasāvitri is silent about nakṣatras on which the principal events of the war took place except at the commencement of the war. It mentions no tithikṣaya or tithivṛddhi. Krsna sends a message with Ulūka to Duryodhana (Udyoga 162, 57 ) 'tomorrow you will be seen' (in your true colours) and Arjuna does the same (Udyoga 163. 14 ). 

The Mahābhārata nowhere states quite explicitly the tithi or nakṣatra on which the battle actually commenced. We have to rely upon various indications to arrive at the tithi or nakṣatra, Balarama could not bear to see the fight between Duryodhana and Bhima, both of whom were his pupils in mace-duel and went on a pilgrimage (Udyoga 157. 33-35 and 158,39). Balarama returned on the 18th day of the war and (in Salyapa rva 34. 6).912

he remarks, 'it is 42 days since I left (on a pilgrimage); I start ed when the moon was in Puṣya and I have come here again on Sravana '1775, In Salya 35. 13-14 it is stated that Balarama went to the river Sarasvati on pilgrimage on 'maitra-naksatra yoga' (i. e. when the moon was in Anuradha ). This conflict may be resolved by holding, as Nilakantha does, that Balarama left the Pandavas on Pusya, reached the Sarasvati on Anuradha and returned on Sravana. If we follow Salya 34.6 the war commenced when the moon was in or near Mrgasirṣa (18 nakṣatras before Sravana ). This would be in direct conflict with a passage in Bhismaparva 17.2 that 1776 on the day of battle the moon was in the province of Magha' and also other passages that will be indicated later on. This last passage should ordinarily mean that the moon was near Magha, Mr Karandikar looks upon Salya 34.6 as an interpolation and takes Bhisma 17.2 to mean that the moon was in an inauspici. ous naksatra of the category of Magha. This would suit Bharani but not Rohiṇi or Mrgaśirṣa. His meaning is far fetched and he does not explain why Bharani was not directly mentioned in the Epic, when in several other places the epic doos mention directly the naksatra concerned. His explanation gives the go-by to the 13th tithi. Dr. Daftari boldly asserts that we must transpose the nakṣatras ( in Salya 34. 6 ) and read *śravape samprayatosmi puṣyeṇa punarāgataḥ'. If we once resort to these methods followed by these two learned writers, there is no knowing where one should stop. There are scholars who might with equal or greater plausibility claim that most of these astronomical references are either of very late date or are inter polations ( vide Vaidya's Mahābhārata' p. 71). Similarly, if we once concede that we are at liberty to change readings to suit our theories even in the total absence of all manuscript evidence, then there is no sure foundation on which we can build. The Mahabharata passages have a tradition of centuries behind them. We must, in the absence of good mss. evidence to the contrary, either accept them all and try to explain them or we must give up the job of reconciling them as a hopeless tangle and rely on other evidence to arrive at the date of the

Bhārata war as best as we can. We saw above that Jyestha was the nakṣatra on Kārtika amāvāsyā and, if the war began then, the nakṣatra on the 18th day from then would be Pusya. Nilakantha, following the Mimāṁsā rules of interpretation, holds that the concluding passage (upasamhāravākya) is superior in strength to passages that occur at the beginning of a work, that the passage in Salya 34. 6 is the dominant one and other conflicting passages must be either brushed aside or explained away in conformity with Salya 34.6 and gives an explanation of Maghāyiṣayagaḥ somah' which is quite unsatisfactory, Dr. Daftari also holds, relying on Atharva Jyotiṣa, that the passage means the moon was in Mūla' (p. 27 para. 62-65 of his work 'Astronomical method' &c.). The explanation is ingenious but one fails to see why this round-about way was resorted to and why the text did not simply say 'mūlanaksatragaḥ somaḥ', which violates no metrical requirements. In Anuśāsana parva ( 167.26-28 ) Bhiṣma, while on the bed of darts, states : 1777 * the sun has turned ( towards the north); 58 days have passed by since I laid myself down on this (arrow bed). This is the mild month of Māgha that is now current, three parts of it remain and this fortnight should be sukla'. Bhiṣma was struck down on the 10th day of the war; so 67 nights had passed from the day when the war began to the day in Māgha on which this was uttered. The difficulty is how to connect 'tribhāgaśeṣah', whether as an adjective of' māsa' or of 'pakṣa'. If we take it in the first way, these words were uttered on 8th of Magha śukla : if we take it as an adjective of pakṣa', then they will have to be taken as uttered on the 4th of the bright half or on the 4th of the dark half which may be regarded in its astrologi cal effects as equal to śuklapakṣa ( though the tithi itself is in the dark half). If the words were uttered on the 8th of Magha śukla, the Bhārata war began on Kartika amāvāsyā (which will be in consonance with Udyoga 142. 18 quoted in n. 1770 ). The passage in Anuśāgana (167. 26-28) is supported by two other passages. After the war was over, Yudhisthira went to the capital and stayed there for 50 nights and when he found that the Sun had started on its apparent northward path (uttarāyana) he came to Bhiṣma ( Anuśāsana 167,5). In Santiparva 51. 14 Krsna says to Bhiṣma: 'You have yet to live 56 days.' Nila kantha, who takes Salya 34. 6 as the dominant passage, puts a

most far-fetched construction on the word "astapañcāsatam', which he takes to mean'one hundred minus 58' i. e. 42 nights and explains 'pañcāśatam ṣat ca as equal to 30. This shows to what straits commentators are reduced when conflicting passages bave got to be explained away. One more indication about the tithi on which the war commenced is afforded by Dronaparva chap. 184, where it is stated that a gtim fight went on till midnight when Ghatotkaca was killed, that the fatigued armies then snatched some sleep, that then the moon rose at about 2 A. M. (verge 46 ) and that the fight was then regumed 1718 ( chap 186. 1 tribhagamātrasesāyām rāiryan yuddham-apartata ). This description of moonrise shows that Ghatotkaca was killed on or about the 11th of the dark half. We know from the Mahābhārata itself that Ghatotkaca was kill ed on the night of the 4th day of Drona's command or on the 14th day after the war began. This would establish that the war began on the 12th or 13th of the bright half and ended on the 14th of the dark balf or on amāvāsya of Mārgasirṣa. Dr. Daftari holds that this description is an interpolation. 

If we try to find out the nakṣatra on which the war began, we have one sure criterion in Salya 34. 6 viz. that the war ended on Sravana naksatra when Balarāma returned from pilgrimage. Now the moon cannot be in Sravaṇa at all in Mārgasirsa dark half, but may be in it on the first or 2nd of the bright half of Pausa. So between the tithi and naksatra as disclosed by the Mahābhārata itself there is a slight dis crepanoy of a day or two. There is another way of looking at the data. Bhıṣma was waiting for uttarāyana to begin and we know that he passed away on the 59th day after he was mortally wounded on the 10th day of the war. Therefore, a period of 67 days ( 58 nights of his lying on arrow-bed plus 9 nights of the battle when he slept on his usual bed ) elapsed between the beginning of the war and the beginning of Uttarayana, which undoubtedly occurred in Magha in that year(as Anuśāsana 167. 28 expressly states). The real difficulty is to find out the tithi of the commencement of Uttarāyaṇa. But if we accept the approximate tithi and naksatra ( as stated above ) of the end of

the war (i.e. Mārgaśirṣa amāvāsyā or 1st of Pauṣa and Sravana nakṣatra ), uttarāyaṇa began 49 days thereafter i. e. on or about the 4th of the dark half of Māgha. According to the Vedānga jyotisa, 4th of the dark half of Māgha is one of the tithis on which uttarayana may begin ( vide Dikehit's work pp. 75, 91 ). How scholars accept one of the data and reject others is well illustrated here. Acc. to Salya 34. 6 the war ended on Sravana (and so should have begun when the moon was in Mrgaśirṣa ). Acc. to the Bhāratasāyitri the war began on Bharani and on the 13th of the bright half of Mārgaśīrṣa and ended on Amā Vābyā (and therefore the nakṣatra was Mūla or Pārvāṣadha ). Arjunamiśra gives up the nakṣatras and sticks to the tithis. Mr. Karandikar gives up the express verse about Sravana (and regards that whole chapter as an interpolation), he gives up the 13th tithi of the beginning of the war as given in the Bhārata sāvitri, holds that the war began on 11th instead and sticks fast to the Bharani naksatra given in the Bhāratasavitrī. Dr. Daftari altogether changes the reading of Salya 34, 6 by transposing the naksatras mentioned. 

The difference between the day of Uttarāyaṇa in Māgha stated in the Mahābhārata and the day thereof at present is utilised by scholars for arriving at the date of the Maha bhārata war. 

There are other data in the Mahābhārata from which also the date of the Mahābhārata war is sought to be deduced. Before entering into details, some matters that are accepted by most scholars may be stated here. It is generally held that there were two eclipses, first, one of the moon immediately followed by a solar eclipse, that there was a fortnight of 13 days which was looked upon as very unusual and a very evil omen. Vide Bhisma 3. 28 quoted in n. 1767. In Bhiṣmaparva 3. 31-32 Vyāsa is reported as saying, 'I have known amāvāsyā occurring on the 14th, 15th or 16th day (of a pakṣa ), but I do not know an amāyāsyā occurring on the 13th day (of a paksa); both the moon and the sun were eclipsed in the same month on the 13th day'. In the Mausala-parva 1779 2. 18-19, when Krsna, 36 years after the war, beheld certain portents it is said, "on observing those portents on the amāvesyā occurring on the 13th day he declared' Rahu had made this ( 13th day ) appear as the 14th and 15th (when usually there is amavasya ) when the Bharata

war took place; to-day it has again occurred for our destruction'. From these words it is clear that the ocourrence of am āvāsya at the end of a pakṣa of 13 days was looked upon as a very evil omen. Then many scholars hold that a comet had also appeared at the time of the great war. Bhiṣma 3. 131780 states, ' a very frightful comet stands in the sky covering the constellation of Pusya'. There are grave doubts whether the statement is made from actual observation. The appearance of a comet has always been associated in ancient times with great calamities. Compare Kumārasambhava II. 32' upaplavāya lokānām dhūmaketurivot thitaḥ'. As indicated above, the Mahābhārata gathers together several possible and impossible things to emphasize their significance as to impending calamities. Therefore the inclu sion of a comet among portents does not establish that a comet had actually appeared at the time of the Bhārata war. Supposing for argument that a comet had appeared, that circumstance is of no help at all in settling the date. A large number of comets is included in the sun's retinue. The number of comets of long periods that approach the sun in a century is said to be 300. There is nothing to show what particular comet appeared at the time of the war and no one has data to connect the Mahābhārata comet with Halley's comet or any other comet well-known in modern times. Therefore the datum about a comet is entirely worthless for purposes of chronology. According to Bṛhatsamhita 11, 5 and Utpala thereon the ancient writer Parāśara held the view that there were 101 ketus and Garga said that there were a thousand. The description in Bhisma 3. 13 states that the perihelion of the comet was in Pusya. In Udyogaparya 143. 10 it is said ' since a graha specially afflicts Citrā, a great calamity is indeed approaching the Kauravas'. This may probably refer to a comet. Two other verses appear to have some bearing on this. Bhisma 3. 12 states 1781 that the white graha stands traversing

citra ( i. e. it is about to enter into svāti) and verse 16 says, the white graha is fiery like fire emitting smoke and stands occupy ing Jyesthā which is a bright star presided over by Indra'. What is meant by 'white graha'? The words. sveto grahaḥ should ordinarily denote Venus. Nilakantha takes them to mean Ketu (node) in Bhisma 3. 12 and another comet in 3. 16. If this latter explanation be accepted there were two comets seen at the time. Even if we hold that Bhisma 3. 16 describes the tail of the comet mentioned in 3. 13, that is of very little help. All that would be meant would be that the tail of the comet was a very long one. Bhisma 3. 17 has been taken to refer to Rāhu by Nilakantha, while some modern scholars hold that it refers to a comet. It means, ' a cruel comet standing between Citrā and Svāti, afflicts Rohini and also the sun and the moon'. The description of the Ketu valled Sveta in Brhat samhitā 11. 39 agrees very closely with the description in the Bhismaparva and Parāśara quoted by Utpala thereon states that thie Ketu called 'Sveta' becomes visible after 115 years and portends the destruction of two-thirds of the population. 

Then there are several passages which state the positions of several planets just before the battle or on the day the battle began. Here again at least two different positions are assigned to each planet except Mercury. It is first to be noted that at the beginning of the war all the seven planets excluding Rabu and Ketu are declared to have been near each other ( Bhiṣma 17, 2, 9. in note 1776 above). We know from the Mahābhārata itself that the Sun and the Moon on Kārtika amāvāsyā were in Jyesthā. If the war began on amāvāsyā or a day later, the planets must be near Jyesthā. If the Bhāratasāvitri be follow ed then the war began on Mārgaśirsa bright 13 and on Bharani. If that were so, the sun and the moon cannot be together. Mr. Karandikar takes 11th of the bright half of Mārgaśırsa to be the tithi of the beginning of the war and holds that the Sun was in nakṣatra Jyesthā and that the moon was in Bharani (following the Bhāratasāvitri as to this last). I should hold that we are not at liberty to take one datum from one group of statements and another from another group and then say that it is proved that the war was fought at a particular time. It is further noted in Karpaparva 37. 4 that on Karṣa's death ( i.e. 17 days after the war began), the seven planets were seen going away from the Sun, 1782 The positions of the planets at the beginning of the war were as follows

not near the Sun but far away. Bhisma 3. 18 declares : 'Mars, having changed 

its motion after being retrograde and with the lustre of fire, stands covering Sravaṇa, the mansion of Bșhaspati' 1704

We find that the Mahābhārate employs two classes of expres siong. When it uses words like' tiṣthati' (stands ), 'akramya' (having traversed ),' samvștya or samparivārya'(having cover ed or concealed ) it means that the planet was in or very near that naksatra. When words meaning "afflicts (pīdayati) are employed, the meaning is probably that the planet has only drsti on the nakṣatra. It is impossible to say whether the rules and theories about dṛsti or purṇa drsṭi and partial dṛsti had been evolved at the time of the Mahābhārata War. If the war was fought about 3101 B, C. or even 1931 B, C. there is nothing to establish that the theories about drsti contained even in the Atharvajyotisa ( which is certainly later than the Vedānga jyotiga of the Rgveda i. e. much later than about 1200 B. C.) were known then. Vide under Venus for further difficulties. JUPITER- Bhisma 3. 14 states that Jupiter was retrograde 

in Sravana ; Bhiṣma 3. 27 states, 1785 Both Jupiter and Saturn that had stayed together 

for a year are near Visakhā and are both fiery'. Jupiter cannot stay for one year in one nakṣatra; 

it traverses 27 naksatras in a year. If at the time of the war Jupiter was near Visakhā it could not have been near it for a year. Eleven months before that it would have been very 

near Citrā. If it was near Viśākha at the time of the war and the Sun was in Jyestha, it can hardly be correct to say that seven planets had come together in the sky (there being' a dis tance of about two naksatras or about 26

degrees between the two). Even if we hold the meaning to be that Jupiter and Saturn had remained near Viśākha for one year and are (now at the time of the war) fiery, that does not solve the difficulty. In the first place, it is not a natural construction. This meaning would leave the exact position of the two planets at the time of the war unspecified. But Jupiter and Saturn must be supposed to be in or near Jyesthā if the Sun was in Jyesthā at the beginning of the war. If Saturn was in Jyestha at the time of the war it could have been one year in Viśākhā about two years before the war. What is the propriety of men tioning Saturn's position two years before the war? The relevant point is to state that posi tion at the time of the war. Therefore it must be held that Bhisma 3. 27 states their position at the time of the war and adds one more circumstance that they were there for one year. 

Karnaparva 94, 51 says: "Brhaspati 'having 

entirely covered Rohipi has become like the Sun and the Moon'. If at the beginning of the war Bṛhaspati was retrograde and was near Visakhā, it passes one's understanding how in a fortnight it came to Rohini. Mr. Karandikar suggests that Rohini here is the name of Jyestha as in the Tai. S. IV. 4. 10. 1-3. Again in this explanation there are several difficulties. There is nothing to show that at the time of the Bhārata war or of the epic Jyesthā was called Rohiṇi. The Tai. S. does not employ the name Jyesthā in its list. It speaks of Rohipi once as having Prajāpati for its presiding deity and then as having Indra as the presiding deity. Jyeṣthā is well-known to the Mahabhārata and the word is employed by it in other passages. Further, if Bphaspati had covered Jyeṣthā it can hardly be correct or even useful (for the purposes of chronology) to say that Jupiter was near Visakha.

VENUS 

Bhisma 3. 15 states that Venus 1786 having ascend 

ed (i. e. occupied ) the Purvābhādrapada paksatra shines charmingly and it looks up to Uttarābhadrapadā together with (?). The meaning of' parikramya sahitaḥ' is not at all clear. However the first half is as clear as possible. Venus was in Pūrvā Prosthapadā. If the Sun was in Jyesthā on Kārtika amāvāsya. it is impossible that Venus could have been in the 8th naksatra from Jyeṣthā. Venus is never more than four nakṣatras from the Sun in the sky. This would completely knock on the head the principal statement that seven planets were near each other. Mr. Karandikar in desperation suggests that we should under stand Pārvāsādhā for "Prosthapade Pārve' and also that the word 'Prosthapade' was an interpolation inserted by some busy body later on. As I have frequently said above, this is a most unjustifiable way of dealing with the so called astronomical data in the Mahābhārata. "Prosthapade Pārve' can never mean ‘Pūrvā sādha'. In the Tai, S. IV, 4. 10. 1-3, and the Tai, Br. I. 5. 1 and III. 1. 1 the word Prostha padā is expressly employed for Pūrva Bhadra pada. Why should one word in a verse be held to be interpolated ? Is it because it does not agree with one's hypothesis? In Salya 11. 18 Venus and Mars are said to be in conjunc tion with the Moon. If the war started on Bharani as the Bhāratasāvitri says, then at the time of the mace-duel the moon might be in Jyesthi and therefore both Mars and Venus will have to be in Jyesthā. But this is oppos ed to two of the passages cited above referring to the position of Mars. If the war began on Jyestha and Kārtika amāvāsyā, then on the 18th day the moon will be in Pusya or Aslesa and both Venus and Mars would have to be in one of these two. In any case, if Venus was

war, on the 18th day it can neither be in Jyestha, nor in Puṣya nor in Aśleṣā. Besides, it is debatable whether Bhisma 3. 16 ( where sveto grahaḥ' is mentioned ) refers to Venus or not. Venus is often called 'Sita' in ancient astronomical works (e. g. in Bphat. 

samhita 9. 42, 45 ). We have four statements about Saturn. In 

Udyoga 143. 8 we read, 1787 'A refulgent and malignant planet, Saturn, afflicts the naksatra presided over by Prajapati (i. e. Rohini)'; Bhisma 2.32 states, 'Saturn afflicts Rohiṇi'; Bhiṣma 3. 14 says, 'the naksatra presided over by Bhaga is covered and afflicted by Saturn'; Jupiter and Saturn are near Visakha (Bhiṣma 3,27 considered above). In the first three passages the root 'pid' occurs and therefore it is possible to argue that some kind of aspect ( drsti or vedha ) of the nakgatra mentioned in the text is meant. But in the third passage both 'akramya' and 'pidyati' are used about the same nakṣatra. This makes that passage inexplicable in the usual way. The 'prājāpatya naksatra'must be Rohiṇi as in the 2nd passage Robiṇi is expressly named. All authorities agree that Prajāpati is the deity of Rohiṇi. 'Prājāpatya naksatra' cannot be taken to mean Mūla, since the presiding deity of Mūla ispitaraḥ' in Tai. 8. IV. 4. 10. 1-3 and Nirfti ( in the Tai. Br. I. 5. 1 and in the Vedānga-jyotiṣa ) and Prajāpati only in some later works. Bhaga is the presiding deity of Uttarā Phalguni in the Tai. S. IV. 4. 10. 1-3 and Tai. Br. I. 5. 1, and IIL 1. 1, while in the Vedāngajyotisa (Rgveda, Verse 25 ), Visṇu Dh. S. (78. 16), San. Gr. (I. 26. 9, SBE vol. 29 p. 53 ) Bhaga is the deity of Purvā Phalguni. The 4th passage about Saturn being near Visakha has been already dealt with under Jupiter.

Astronomical data in Mahābhārata 

923 

The above detailed statement about the astronomical passages of the Mahabhārata will induce any unbiassed reader who has no axe to grind that they are hopelessly inconsistent and that no certain chronological conclusion can be drawn therefrom. In the above discussion I have generally not cited the various explanations indulged in by several scholars, as that would have involved me in a very lengthy discourse without any adequate benefit. To me it appears probable that the final redactor of the Mahābhārata had two or more sets of astronomical data about the war before him and without trying to examine and sift them he included them all in his work. The Bharata savitri probably represents one (and a later) tradition about the positions of the planets at the time of the war. As I hold that either the Mahābhārata passages on the positions of the planets were interpolated at a very late stage or are hope lessly inconsistent I deem it unnecessary to enter upon an examination of the mathematical calculations made by several scholars to find out the date of the Bhārata war from the shift ing of the solstices and the position of the planets. 

Since only 5046 years have elapsed (in 1945 A. D.) from the beginning of the Kali age and as Kaliyuga extends to 432000 years according to Paurānic computations we are just on the threshold of the Kaliyuga and it is beyond one's com prehension to visualize what will happen towards the end of the vast period of about 427000 years that are still to pass before Kaliyuga ends. It is very small consolation to read in the Purānas in a prophetic strain that at the end of that colossal period Visnu will be incarnated as Kalkin in a village Sam. bhala, will destroy all Mlechbas, śūdra kings and heretics and will establish dharma, so that the Krta age will then be ushered in. Here again as in almost all matters there are differences in the legend. The Vāyu ( 58. 75-90 ) and the Matsya (144, 50-64 ) state that it will be Pramati Bhargava who will be the avatāra of Viṣnu and uproot the Mlechhas, heretics and sūdra 

· kings, while Vayu 98. 104-110 and 99. 396-7, Vanaparva 190. 93-97, Bhāgavata XII. %. 16-23 state that Kalkin will conquer the Mleochas, will become a universal emperor ( cakravartin ) of the dharmavijayin type and will start the Krta age. In some passages he is oalled Kalki (nom. of Kalkin ) as in Vanaparva 190.93, Brahma 213. 164, Vāyu 99.396, Matsya 47, 248, Nṛsimha 54. 3; while in others as Kalkih (nom. of Kalki) as in Vayu 98. 104, Kalki 2. 28, Bhagavata XIL 2. 16, Matsya 47, 251.

17882. Various efforts have been made about finding germs of history in the legend of Kalkin. In I. A. vol. 48 pp. 123-128 Prof. H. B. Bhide tries to show how Jain authorities about Kalkin are conflicting. Mr. K. P. Jayaswal in I. A. vol. 46 (for 1917) p. 145 holds tbat Kalkla must be identified with the great hero Yasodharman who ruled over India from the Brahmaputrā to the Western Ocean and from the Himālaya to Mahendra and who conquered the Hun Mibirakula and made him pay homage to his feet as stated in the Mandasor Inscription (vide Gupta Ias. p. 149). Prof. Pathak on the other hand relying upon certain Jaina sources identifies Kalkin with Mibirakula himself (I. A. for 1918 at p. 19). Otto Schrader in Brahmavidyā vol. I. pp. 17-27 discusses how the names Kalkin or Kalki came to be given to the saviour of India from Mlecchas, heretics and the like. Kalka means 'sin' or 'sediment' and Karka means 'a white horse'. Therefore he thinks that Kalkin is a form of karkin (one riding a white borse). Vide also N. I. A, vol. IV, pp. 337–343 (on Kalki from the Kalki. purāṇa). It is probable that the dismal accounts of Kaliyuga were put forth in the first centuries of the Christian era when the ancient varna śrama-dharma had suffered a great set-back owing to the ascendancy of Buddhism and Jainism and the invasions of foreigners like the Sakas and Hūnas, that when Yasodharman defeated the great Hun invader Mihirakula, people believed that the dark ages were at an end and that an era of per fect dharma was at hand. That Mihirakula was a most rutbless and blood. thirsty invader who in his long career of 70 years slaughtered myriads of men and women is stated by the Rājatarangini I. 310 ( wbich speaks of him as trikotihan) and 322 (which narrates that he slaughtered three crores of women of respectable birth together with their husbands, brothers and sons). Hiouen Chwang (Beal's B. R. W. W. pp. 171-172) narrates that Mihirakula either slaughtered or made slaves of nine lakhs of people in Gandhāra. Passages in a prophetic vein were added about the time of Yasodharman to those already existing about the decline of dharma in Kali. yuga. This will of course necessitate that all passages about Kalkin in any work wbatever were put in later than about 530 A. D. There are two theories as to who defeated Mihirakula. Hlouen Chwang's account gives the name of the victor as Bālāditya of Magadba (vide Beal's B. R. W, W, part I. pp. 167-171). On the other hand there are three inscriptions, the

he is said to have already flourished (Vāyu 98. 111, Matsya 47. 255 ), in other places the texts employ the future ( Vāyu 99. 396, Bhagavata XII. 2. 16). This last discrepancy is probably due to the fact that the writers sometimes forget their role of prophets. Further, it has to be remembered that according to the Purāṇas the four yugas (and therefore the Kalki avatāra ) have been repeated again and again. The Kalki-purāpa (I. %. 33 and I. 3. 32-33 ) states that Kalki was a contemporary of Vigākhayūpa king of Māhismati, while the Vayu (99, 312-314), Matsya ( 272. 4) and Viṣnu (IV. 24)-state that Viśākbayūpa was the 3rd of the Pradyota dynasty that preceded the Siśunāga dynasty. Though the Kalki-purāna several times uses the past tensa about Kalki, yet at the very beginning it says (I. 10) that what is narrated is an ākhyāna (story) of the future. It is interesting to note that in the Parnālaparvata-grahan akhyāna27896 of Jayarāma composed about 1673 A.D. Bahlolkhan, 

(Continued from the last page ) Gwalior stone Inscription of Mihirakula (Gupta Ins. No. 37 p. 161), the Mandasor stone Pillar Inscription of Yasod harman (Gupta Ing. No. 33 p. 142), and the Mandasor Stone Inscription of Yasodharman Viṣnuvar dhana (Gupta Ins. No. 35 p. 150) in none of which is Bālāditya referred to. But in the Sarnath Stone of Prakatāditya, son of Bālāditya, another Baliditya is referred to (Gupta Ins. No. 79 p. 284 ). In the Maodasor Stone Pillar Inscription (Gupta Ins. p. 147) occur these words relating to Mibirakula pana 777 Foraya atau tergurau fhithout araga Io the Mandasor Stone Ins. (Gupta Ins.

Dr. Fleet beld that Yasodharman and Viṣnuvardhana were different, but the reasons he assigns are unconvincing and Jayaswal appears to be right in holding that Visnuvardhana is the same as Yasodharman (in 'Imperial History' pp. 39. 41 ) and that Viṣnuvardhana was the overlord of Balāditya. It appears likely that the compilers of the extant Porānas combined the two principal parts of the two nanes Visnuvardhana and Yasodharman and that the con. queror of the Mlecchas was said to be Viṣnuyasas. Vide I. H. Q. vol. XII p. 531 and vol, XV pp. 302-306 for Yasodharman, Viṣnuvardhana and Mihirakula and Dr. R. G.

Pargiter's 'Ancient Indian tradition' and 'Dynasties of tbe Kali age' and Dr. Fradhan's 'Chropology of Ancient India' may be read with advantage in connection with the historic material in the Puranas.

commander-in-chief of the Bijapur army, is made to say to Khawaskhan, the Vazir, as follows, 'In the Hindu śāstras some say that Kalkin, the 10th avatāra of Vispu will be born and he will destroy the hordes of Yavanas. Shivaji appears to be the first harbinger of that Kalkin'. 

Even though the Purāṇas are carried away by their over zeal in condemning the moral and physical decline of the Kali age, almost all of them exhibit no verses about matters for bidden in the Kali age. We have to see when the topic of Kalivarjya attained prominence and what the matters are that were once practised by people without objection and that later on came to be prohibited or condemned. 

The Ap. Dh. Ş. ( II. 6. 14. 6-10) condemns the practice of giving all or most of the ancestral property to the eldest son as opposed to śāstras. The Āp. Dh, S. (II. 10. 27. 2-6), after referring to the view of some that a woman when being married is given to the whole family of the bridegroom, condemns the practice of niyoga.2789 Both these practices (of uddhāravibhāga and of niyoga ) are among those included in the texts on Kalivarjya, Among the earliest references in the smrtis to practices once current, but forbidden in the Kali age is a passage of Bphaspati quoted by Aparārka p. 97, where niyoga and the numerous secondary sons are said to be impossible owing to the decadence1790 of spiritual power among men of the Dvāpara and Kali ages. Aparārka p. 739 and the D. M. quote a passage of Saunaka to the effect that sons other than the aurasa or dattaka are not allowed in the Kali age 1791. Prajāpati (verse 151 ) refers 1792 to the ancient practice of offering meat and wine in srāddhas, but prescribes that these should be eschewed in the Kali age.

the setting of the three vedic fires and of resorting to sannyāsa after 4400 years of Kali. The Laghu-Asvalāyana 1794 smrti (21. 14-15 ) states that the two kinds of sons called Kunda and Golaka were permitted in former ages and had the samskāras performed on them, but are condemned in the Kali age. Visva rūpa and Medhātithi, it is worth noting, do not quote a single verse about Kalivarjya. On Yaj. III. 30 Viśvarūpa tries to recon cile Parāśara III. 5 (saying that a brāhmaṇa who is learned in the Veda and keeps the sacred Vedic fires becomes free from im purity in a day) with Parāśara III. 8 ( that for ten days on impurity due to birth or death the food of that family becomes unpartakable for others). He does not accept the idea that the period of impurity is only one day for a learned man, but explains that Parāśara III. 5 is only an arthavāda meant for glorifying the study of Veda and the keeping of sacred fires. Among later commentators it is stated that the narrowing down of the periods of impurity on the ground of Veda study is forbidden in the Kali age. As this explanation is not offered by Visvarūpa it is not unreasonable to infer that Visvarūpa was not aware of the passage on this point quoted from the Adityapurāṇa. Medhātithi 1795 also (on Manu IX, 112 ) refers to the opinion of some that the smrti passages about niyoga and uddhāra-vibhāga were applicable. only in bygone ages, since emstis are restricted to certain ages ( vide Manu I. 85); but he refutes that view and explains Manu I. 85 by saying that the meaning is that the dharmas (i. e. qualities or natures of things) change from age to age as they do from season to season. From this it is clear that he did not accept that certain practices current in one age were forbidden in others. Vijñāneśvara 1796 quotes a single verse which condemns the practice of niyoga, the giving of a special share to the eldest son and the killing of a cow in a sacrifice as not allowable in the Kali age.

The Sm.C. quotes a verse of Kratu which forbids four acts in Kali, viz. niyoga, remarriage of a married girl, killing a cow in sacrifices and the taking of a jar.1797 The Naradiya-mahapurana contains four verses about Kalivarjya stating that certain practices which were once allowed are forbidden in the Kali age, viz. sea voyage, the carrying of a jar of water, marrying a girl of a class lower than one's own, niyoga, killing of an animal in Madhuparka, offering of flesh in sraddhas, the stage of a forest hermit, remarriage of a married girl when the marriage was not con summated, perpetual student-hood, human sacrifice, horse sacri fice, starting on the great journey, the sacrifice of a cow 1798. Aparārka ( pp. 15, 63 ) quotes one verse and a half from the Brahmapurāna about certain Kalivarjyas viz. perpetual student hood, the carrying of a kamandalu, marriage with a sagotra or sapinda girl, the killing of a cow, human sacrifice, horsa sacri fice, drinking intoxicating liquors 1799.

Aparārka (p. 98) quotes another passage from the Brahmapurana 1800, which condemns remarriage of women, niyoga, independence of women, on the ground that men in the Kali age are sinners. Aparārka (p. 233 ) quotes two versos from a smrti (without name) the first of which prohibits six acts, viz. killing a cow in sacrifice, niyoga (of husband's brother), the performance of satiras, taking a water jar, use of wine (in sautrāmaṇi), being an ascetic (of the paramahamsa type) and the second prohibits five, viz. human sacrifice, cow sacrifice, the taking of a kamandalu, niyoga, and the remarriage of a girl whose marriage has not been consummated. Aparārka (p. 233 ) quotes a passage from the Markandeya recommending the offering of a golden vessel in place of the cow in Madhuparka and stating that Bhrgu laid down that no animal was to be sacrificed in Kali. The Sm. C. (I. p. 12) quotes a Purana passage that 'the remarriage of a married woman, special share to the eldest son, the killing of a cow, niyoga and the taking of a kamandalu-these five are to be avoided in Kali 1801.

There is a work called Kalivarjyavinirnaya or Kalivarjyanirṇaya composed by Damodara elder brother of Nilakanṭlia (first half of 17th century A. D.), who in his Samaya mayūkha refers to it. It quotes the Adityapurana, Brahma purana and other texts that are quoted here from Hemādri and other older digests 1804 

In the passage quoted the several Kalivarjyas are not arranged on any systematic basis. Here, first of all a few Kalivarjyas that have a bearing on law will be mentioned and then the rest will be taken up one after another in the order in which they appear in the extract and lastly those that do not appear in that extract will also be dealt with. The first verse states that certain actions were discarded by the wise though this was unauthorized ( by śruti or smrti ) after arriving at a convention among themselves through fear of the loss of dharma ( if they were persisted in), because in the Kali age there is absence of good men. The last verse and a half again state that at the beginning of the Kali great men arrived at certain conven tions and discarded certain actions in order to guard the people ( against harm and sin) and (it is well known) that the conven tions of good men are authoritative like Veda 1805,

%. Appointing the husband's brother (or a sagotra &c. ) to raise issue on the wife of a sonless man. This is called niyoga and has been dealt with at length in H. of Dh, vol. II. pp. 599 607. It may be added here that in the K. V. N. there is a long discussion on the question whether an elder brother of the deceased could have been appointed to raise issue on his younger brother's widow and gives it as the opinion of some that he could not be go appointed, but that only a younger brother could be appointed to raise issue on his elder brother's widow. They rely on the Mit. on Yaj. I. 68 where 'devara' is paraphrased as * kaniyan bhrāta'. The K. V. N. (folio 5 band 6 a) relying on Manu IX, 62 and the words of the Mit. on Yāj. II. 127 (where Manu IX. 69-70 are cited and explained as 'devaras-tasya jyeṣthaḥ kanistho vā) holds that any brother whether alder or younger than the husband could be appointed. 

3. 'The admission of several kinds of secondary song other than the aurasa and the dattaka. For this vide above pp. 647-653. 

4. Remarriage of widows. This subject has been dealt with in H. of Dh. vol. II. pp. 608 ff. Some texts such as Vas. 17. 74 make a distinction between the remarriage of a woman whose marriage was not consummated and of a woman whose marriage was consummated, remarriage being allowed in the first case but not in the 2nd. The Kalivariya texts forbid remarriage in both cases. 1807 

5. Intercaste marriages. . This subject has been treated of in H. of Dh. vol. II. pp. 447-451. It has been shown by me above (pp. 599-600 ) that the decisions in 46 Bom. 871 and 55 Bom. 1 are based upon a misunderstanding about the real views of Nilakaptha.

of sapiṇda relationship, pp. 497 ff. for prohibition on the ground of gotra and pp. 458-463 for marriage with maternal uncle's daughter. The custom of marrying the maternal uncle's daughter has persisted to this day in many castes in spite of the inclusion of it among Kalivarjyas. An inscription at Nāgārjunikonda ( 3rd century A. D.) shows that Virapuruṣa-datta, son of Santa mūla, married three daughters of his paternal aunts ( E. I. vol. 

XX. p. 1). 

7. Slaying a brahmana who comes as an atatāyin in a properly conducted fight. Vide H. of Dh. vol. II, pp. 148-151 and p. 517 above for this subject. 

8. Awarding of fines against witnesses who depose in disputes between father and son. 1808 It has already been seen (p. 299 ) how ordinarily suits between husband and wife, father and son were not encouraged in ancient India. But when such a dispute came to the king's notice he could take action suo motu, as Nār. includes 'pitāputra-vivāda' among the miscella neous matters ( prakirṇaka verse 3) which the king was to set in motion. Even in ancient times this rule must not have been strictly enforced. As time went on and separation of father and son became frequent the rule must have appeared to be un reasonable. Vide Mit, on Yaj. II. 32 referred to above in n. 418, Yaj. II. 239 ( = Matsya 227. 198) prescribed a fine of 3 paṇas for those who (instead of composing the quarrel between father and son and being able to do so ) undertake to be witnesses. Viśvarūpa read ' a fine of two hundred paṇas'. Viṣṇu Dh. S. V. 120 prescribes a fine of ten paṇas. This shows that at the time of the Matsyapurāṇa this act was probably not included among Kalivarjyas, 

9. Taking (or stealing ) of corn even from one whose actions are lowly (i. e. even from a sūdra ), when a brahmana has been without food for six times (i. e. three days). Gaut. 18. 28-29, Manu XI. 16 and Yāj. M. 43 provide that when a brahmana cannot earn his maintenance in a season of distress even in any one of the ways indicated in Yāj. III. 4% and has been hungry for three days he may steal or take away one day's food even from a low person such as a sūdra. It should be noted that this Kalivariya text pointedly repeats the very

words of Manu XI. 16 'bhaktāni sad-anaśnatā ... bartavyam hinakarmapaḥ ). In ancient times theft of such a minor nature was permitted when the brāhmaṇa was famished. But later times took a stricter view of the matter. 

10. The admission to intercourse of a brāhmaṇa who undertakes a sea voyage, even though he may have performed the penance prescribed for the same' (1.7 in the appendix ). Here the word used is 'dvijasya'. It may mean either any person of the three higher castes or a brahmana. If a man who has made a sea voyage took prāyaścitta he expiated only the sin, but did not become fit, according to this dictum, to be associated with by others. Whether the Vedic Aryans knew the sea has been doubted. Vide Vedic Index' on samudra', vol. II. pp. 431-433. The Nirukta II, 10 refers to the fact that a doubt arises whether the word 'samudra' in a particular vedio Verse refers to the sea or to the sky. In some verses as in Rg. X. 98, 5'he discharged divine rain waters from the higher to the lower samudra' both the meanings of 'samudra' (viz. sea, sky) are pointedly brought out. Vide also Rg. VII. 6.7 (a samudrad-avarādā parasmāt). In Rg. VII. 95. 2 Sarasvati is mentioned as going from the mountains to the sea. In Rg. X. 136.5 the two seas, Eastern and Western, are mentioned ( ubhau samudrāvā kṣeti yaśca pūrva utāparaḥ). In Rg. VIII. 6. 4 it is said, ' all people bend down to him, as the sindhus (rivers) flow to the Ocean,' Rg. I. 116. 4-5, X. 39. 4 and X. 143. 5 refer to the story that Asyins saved Bhujyu from the waters of the sea. 1809 The Atharvavada XI. 2. 25 refers to eastern sea and northern sea. There is no doubt that in the Brāhmaṇas the sea was well-known. The Tai. Br. II. 2. 5.6 remarks,'there is no end to desire and also to samudra' (neva hi kāmasyāntosti na samudrasya). The Ait. Br. ( 40.2) remarks 'just as the sea stands surrounding the earth' (tābhi rājānam parigphya tiṣthati samudra iva bhūmim). It has already been seen that among the five practices peculiar to the north the Baud. Dh. 8. (I 1. 22) enumerates sean voyage ( samudra-samyāna) as the last and condemns it. Baud. (II. 1. 51) places sea voyage at the head of grave sins (patanīyāni ) along with misappro priating a brābmana's wealth kept as a deposit. The Mit.

on Yaj. IIL 288 quotes the sutra of Baud. Manu (II. 158 and 166-167) provides that a brāhmana who had been on a 888 yoyage was sinful and was not to be invited at a śraddha. But it is clear that Manu does not say that such a brāhmaṇa altogether loses caste or that he becomes alto gether unfit to be associated with; all that Manu provides is that such a brāhmaṇa became unfit for invitation at a sraddha. The Auśanagasmrti (IV. pp. 525-526) declares that those who sell the Veda, who marry a widow, who undertake a sea voyage are patita and are not to be invited at a srāddha. These passages show that the prohibition against gen voyage affected only brahmanas and even then they did not apparently become alto gether unfit to be associated with. That brāhmaṇas crossed the ocean and went to such distant countries as Siam, Cambodia, Java, Sumatra and Borneo can be easily proved 1810. E. I. vol. 17 p. 314 gives references to inscriptions from Borneo to show that brāhmaṇas from India migrated to that country about 400 A. D. That kings and merchants undertook sea voyages is also clear from several considerations. The Bāveru Jātaka ( vol. III No. 339, Fausböll) tells us that merchants, from Benares went to Babylon in order to sell Indian goods. The 'Questions of Milinda's. B. E. vol. 36 p. 269 refers to a ship-owner voyaging by sea to distant countries 1811. The Rajatarangini refers to the sea voyage of an envoy of king Jayāpida of Kashmir to Ceylon (IV. 503-506 ). Manu VIII. 157 prescribes that the king should allow that rate of interest which those who are adepts in sea voyages and land journeys and who understand what is required to be the interest at certain times and in certain

places determine to be the proper one. Yāj. II. 38 provides for very high interest ( 20 per cent per month ) from those who engage in trade by sea. Nār. IV. 179 says that a trader ( samu dra-vanik) who makes bea voyages is not a proper witness, The Vāyu ( 45. 78-80 ) and other purāṇas state that Bharata varṣa 1812 has nine divisions called dvipas, all of which are separated from each other by the sea and are not (easily accessible, that Jambudvipa ( India proper ) is the 9th dvipa and the other oight are Indra, Kaseru, Tamraparpi, Gabhastimat, Nāga, Saumya (Siam ?), Gandharva, Vāruna ( Borneo ?). Therefore Bharatavarsa according to Paurāṇic Geography in cluded modern India and also Greater India. None of the ancient works at least says anything against sūdras under taking sea voyages; but now even sūdras, probably in their desire to emulate the brāhmaṇa and rise higher in social esteem, think that sea voyage is forbidden to them also. 

When during the latter half of the 19th century some brāhmaṇas went to England on a political mission or for study and returned to India, the question whether after taking the appropriate prāya citta those brāhmapas could be associated with fully as before was referred to many orthodox and learned Pandits (such as the late Taranātha Tarkavācaspati) and it is creditable to the Pandits and gratifying to note that many of them came to the conclusion that they could be asso 

ciated with by others. The two principal texts referred to were those of the Bphan-Naradapurana (note 1798 above) and the one from the Adityapurāṇa translated at the head of this parti cular Kalivarjya. Very interesting and hairsplitting argu ments and explanations were advanced by the learned Pandite in 1872. Some of them may be noted here.. As regards the Nāradiya passage, it is argued that only that seavoyage is for bidden in the Kali, which was a righteous act (dharma) in former times. In Parāśara-smpti XII. 58 the following prāya. scitta 1813 is prescribed for brāhmaṇa murder: 'the sinner should

be directed to perform the penance of going to the setu on the ocean; he should beg for alms on the road to the setu from men of the four classes that are free from improper acts, should walk barefooted and without umbrella, should deolare his sin in all towns, villages and hamlets of cowherds on the way while resting there or in forests, sacred places and rivers and after reaching the sea and on seeing the setu, 100 yojanas long and 10 yojanas broad, constructed with heaps of stones at the bidding of Rāma by Nala he will get rid of the sin of brahmana murder'. Here brahmana murder being a most heinous offence it cannot be supposed that a mere sight of the setu from land would absolve the sinner and the words about the length and breadth of the setu would be otherwise meaningless. Therefore what is meant is that he must uudertake a sed-voyage and go along the whole length and breadth of the setu in a vessel. Such a voyage was religious conduct in former ages, but in Kali this is forbidden. The word 'holding a kamandalu' (which also was prescribed as dharma in former ages) conveys that a similar or analogous practice is referred to in the imme diately preceding words. The words 'dvijasyābdhau &o.' are to be interpreted as follows: 'nauyātuh' is the genitive singular of * naujātr'. The affix 'tr' is not the ordinary 'tr' but it is 'tṛn' used in the sense of one who habitually does a thing', accord ing to Pāṇini III. 2. 134-135. 1814 Therefore the words of the Adityapurāpa apply only to a dvija who habitually engages in a sea voyage either as a trader or as a helmsman or sailor. When Nārada (D&yabhiga 21 ) states that even an aurasa son who is hostile to his father or who is patita ( guilty of one of the five great sins) or is impotent or is 'apayatrita' he does not get a share of ancestral wealth, the Vyavahāramayūkha explains the last word as 'one who goes to another continent (other than Jambudvipa) through mid ocean by means of a vessel for purposes of trade' and relies on this passage (dvijasyabdhau &c.) for support. So according to the author of the V. Mayūkha only that dvija who constantly undertakes sea voyages for trade is here declared to be unfit for social intercourse though he may have taken a prāyascitta, and not one who casually or once in a life undertakes a sea voyage. No text prescribes a prūyagcitta merely for going in a vessel on the sea. If that were intended in this passage the text would have read different ly vix,' samudre naugamanābhāve &o.' Even sistas have been

crossing the sea to Ceylon for purposes of trade. In dramas like the Ratnāvali ( where the kañcukin Babhravya undertakes a sea voyage and a merchant from Kausambi is said to have gone to Ceylon ) and in romances like the Dasakumāracarita frequent references are made to sea voyages to Ceylon and other countries. What is aimed to be bit when prāyaścitta for sea voyage is prescribed is the fact that on such voyages a man may give up for long such daily duties as the performance of sandhyā and may have come in very close contact with mlecchas as regards food etc. If he has done these two, then only he is not fit for inter course even though he may have undergone a prāyasoitta. If he performs his daily duties wherever he may dwell and does not come in too close a contact with mlecchas he may have to perform no prāyaścitta, much less would he become unfit for social intercourse. The view of Medhātithi on Manu II. 23 that any country by itself is not unfit for the residence of an arya, that if mlecchas overrun a country in India and permanently reside there it may become a mlecchadeśa, that even a mlecoha country, if it be conquered by an Indian king and if the system of the four varnas be introduced therein, would be a fit one for the performance of Vedio sacrifices, has already been noted (in H, of Dh. vol. II. p. 16 ). It has to be remembered that the Adiparva (85, 34) states that mlecchas and yavanas sprang from Anu and Turvasu, sons of Yayāti. The Sabhāparva notes that Bhima made mlecchas dwelling beyond the seas and in Anūpa bring tribute ( 30. 25-27 ) and that mlecchas came to see the Rajasūya sacrifice along with Bhagadatta of Pragjyotisa (Sabhā 34. 9-10). The following propositions follow from the above discussion: (1) As the word 'dvija' is used a śūdra or a person of the mixed castes ( sankirna-jāti) does not become unfit for social intercourse even by habitually undertaking a sea voyage, but he may have to undergo a prāyaścitta; (2) a dvija who casually undertakes a sea yoyage to a place outside India either at the king's bid ding or for any other purpose has to undergo a prāyasoitta, but if he does so he becomes fit for social intercourse ; (3) & dvija habitually undertaking & sea voyage for trade or as a sailor would become unfit for intercourbe even after undergoing prayas citta. Manu IX. 314, when enlarging upon the devastating power of brābmaṇas, mentions that the sea was made undrinkable by brāhmaṇas, which, according to Medhatithi and other commenta tors, has in view the story in Santi 343.60-61. It is difficult to say whether this story had any influence in leading to the pro hibition against sea yoyage..

The Smṛtikaustubha explains that 'samudrayātrā' means tirthayatra' i. e. pilgrimage to holy places beyond the sea and that is forbidden here. But this seems to be wrong, as stated by Kronabhatta on the Nir. S. The latter says that expiation is to be undergone only where a soa voyage is undertaken from worldly motives, but where a sea voyage has to be undertaken for reaching a holy place like the Saṅkhoddhāra-tirtha, it is an inseparable part of the pilgrimage and therefore there is no necessity to undergo a prayascitta. 1815 

11. 'The initiation for a sattra' (1.8). Sattras were sacri ficial sessions the duration of which varied from 12 days to a year, 12 years or even more. Only brāhmaṇas could perform them (Jai. VI. 6. 16-23). Acc. to Sabara on Jai. VI. 2. 1 per sons who engaged in them must not be less than 17 nor more than 24. All of them were both sacrificers (yajamāna ) as well as priests. Vide H. of Dh. vol. II pp. 1239-1246 for sattras. The prohibition against engaging in sattras is a clear indica tion that people had become tired of the ancient Vedic sacrifices, of the great demands they made on time and wealth and had begun to prefer other and easier modes of worship. 

12. "Carrying a jar of water' (1. 8). The Baud. Dh. S. I. 4 devotos numerous 1816 sūtras (1-27 ) to the subject of carry ing an earthon or wooden jar full of water. Every snataka was always to carry a jar of water from which he was to take water for fauca. He was to wash it with water and rub it with his hand. This was declared to be equal to paryagnikarana (encir cling with fire for purification, vide H. Dh, vol. II p. 1120 n. 2501 ). . He was not to go to another's house or to the village boundary or on a journey without the jar. Vas. 12, 14-17, Manu IV. 36, Yaj. I. 133 contain similar provisions. Visva rūpa explains that the anataka himself need not carry it and that it may be carried for him by another. It was an encum brance, gave rise to unhygienic and unclean habits and so gradually it came to be dispensed with. This practice was regularised by declaring that in the Kali age a water jar was

not to be carried at all. The Madanapārijata (p. 16 ) explained that 'kamandaluvidharana' refers to perpetual studenthood, but this explanation cannot be accepted, because in the Nāradiyapurāṇa (note 1798 above) both are mentioned sepa rately. The K. V. N. (folio 3 a) notes that some explained * kamandaluvidhāraṇam' as standing for 'dirghakālam brahma caryam' (studenthood for long periods). 

13. 'Starting on the Great Journey' (1.9). The Brhan Nāradiya-purāṇa (pārvārdha 24. 16 ) also forbids this. Accor ding to Manu VI. 31 and Yāj. III. 55 a forest hermit, when he Buffered from an incurable disease and could not perform the duties of his order, was allowed to start towards the north-east on the Great Journey (mahāprasthana) till the body fell down to rise no more. Similarly, a man guilty of brāhmana murder was allowed to meet death at the hands of archers or to throw himself head foremost into fire. Vide H. of Dh. vol. Il. pp. 924 928 for Mahāprasthānagamana. Aparārka 1817 (p. 877-879) quotes long passages from the Adipurāṇa to the effect that if a man suffering from an incurable disease starts on the Great Journey in the Himalaya or commits suicide by entering fire or water or by falling from a precipice, not only does he not incur sin, but on the contrary he goes to heaven. It is rather inconsistent that the Adipurana (or Adityapurāṇa ) should in one place extol the starting on the Great Journey and in another place should forbid it in the Kali age. The K. V. N. cites the instance of the Pandavas that are said to have started on the Great Journey. This makes one suspicious about the authenticity of the passages on Kalivarjya quoted from the Adityapurana by some and from Adipurāṇa by others. 

14. 'The killing of a cow in the sacrifice called Gogava' (1.9). 

There were various occasions on which in ancient times & cow was sacrificed. The Anubandhyā cow killed at the end of the Udayaniyā iṣti in Agnistoma has been referred to above (on p. 627 n. 1196). In the Madhuparka which was offered

to an honoured guest a cow was either killed or let loose at the desire of the guest. Vide H. of Dh. vol. II pp. 543-545. A cow was killed in one of the three or four aṣtakā sraddhas ( vide Khādira gr. III. 4.1, Gobhila gr. II. 10. 16). Ap. Dh. S. II. 7. 16. 25 states that if cow's flesh is offered in sraddha for the pitrs, the latter are gratified for one year. There was a sacrifice called Gosava or Gomedha, that was an Ukthya in which the fees were ten thousand cows and which according to some could be performed only by & vaisya (Kāt. Śr. 22. 11. 1818 3-8). A bull was killed as an offering in the rite called śūlagava ( vide H. of Dh. vol. II pp. 831-832 ). As flesh-eating came to be looked down upon, cow sacrifice became most abhorrent and Kalivarjya texts only register a prohibition which had been acted upon centuries before. 

15. "The employment of cups of wine in the Sautrāmapi' (1. 10). 

The Sautrāmaṇi is not a soma sacrifice but it is a combi nation of an iṣti with an animal sacrifice. It was so called from sutrāman' (an epithet of Indra). Its peculiar charac toristio was the offering of surā in cups. In modern times milk is offered in its place and Ap. Śr. allowed it even in ancient times 1819. It was included among the seven haviryajñas by Gaut. (VIII. 20). At the end of the Rajasūya it was performed or in Agnicayana or for one who suffered vomiting or purging from the excessive drinking of soma. For sautrāmani and the preparation of surā in it, vide H. of Dh. vol. IL pp. 1225-1228. Bhattoji (in com. on Caturvimsati-mata p. 53 ) and the Nirnaya sindhu construe this to mean “having social intercourse with one who employs surā in Sautrāmaṇi' but this is not satis factory. The Dharmasindhu explains as above (III. purvārdha p. 357 ) 1820

16. The licking of the Agnihotrahavaṇl and the use of it even after it was licked'(1.11). In the Agnihotra the sruva ladle is held in the right hand and the sruc called agnihotra havani is held in the left and the milk is poured into the latter from the milk pot with sruva. After the Agnihotra homa is offered the agnihotrabavani is licked twice in order to take out the remnants of the milk and after wiping it with darbha blades it is used again. Ordinarily a vessel when it is once licked by a man cannot be used again in a religious rite unless proper purification is resorted to. But this did not apply to the Agni hotrahavapi and camascus of soma. Vide H. of Dh. vol.

The licking of the agnihotrahavaṇl and its use constitute really the subject of the prohibition. 1821 

17. 'Entering on the stage of forest hermit as laid down in the texts about it' (1. 12). Gaut. III. 25-34, Ap. Dh. S. (II. 9. 21. 18 to II. 9. 23. 2 ), Manu VI. 1-32, Vas. IX. 1-11, Yaj. III. 45-55 lay down elaborate rules for the stage of forest hermits. Vide H. of Dh. vol. II pp. 917-929 for a description and remarks on sannyāsa to be made later on. 

18. "The narrowing down or curtailment of the periods of impurity depending upon the Vedic learning and the mode of life of a person' (1. 13). 'Agha' means 'asauca'; *vitta' (mode of life) refers to tending sacred fires or maintaining oneself in the way described by Manu IV, 7-10. The general rule about the period of impurity for a brāhmaṇa on the death of a sapiṇda was stated by Gaut. 14. 1, Manu V. 59 and 83 to be that it was ten days and Angiras quoted by the Mit. on Yāj. III. 22 prescribes impurity for ton days for all varpas, but Manu V. 59 also spoke of the period being four days, three days or one day, which, acc. to the Mit, on Yaj. III. 28–29, refers respectively to kumbhidhānya, one who has collected food for three days or one who collects nothing for the morrow. Dakṣ& VI. 6 and Para

(vol. 

śara 1822 III, 5 both state that a brāhmaṇa who keeps the Vedic fires and has studied the Veda becomes free from impurity in a day, one who has only studied the Veda ( but does not tend sacred fires ) becomes free in three days, while one devoid of both becomes free after ten days. Aparārka (p. 894) and Haradatta on Gaut. 14. 1 quote Bṛhaspati to the same effect. The Mit. remarks 1823 (on Yaj. IIL 28-29) that the curtailment of the period of impurity is not absolute but is restricted only to certain special matters viz. the receiving of gifts, the performance of Agnihotra, the study of the Veda and such matters in which distress would be caused if the period were not curtailed. This explanation clearly proves that Vijñanes vara ( end of 11th century ) was not aware of the prohibition of the curtailmont of the periods of impurity or treated it with scant respect. The curtailment of the period of impurity was laid down probably because curtailment led to confusion, since a person may claim to be learned, while his neighbours may not concede that claim. 

19. 'Prescribing death as the penance for brāhmaṇas'. (1. 14). 

Manu XI. 89 provides that if a person intentionally murders a brāhmaṇa there is no expiation for it. Manu XI. 90 prescribes death by drinking boiling wine for the sin of drinking sura, while Manu XI. 146 provides 1824 that if a man knowingly drinks wine there is no expiation for it, but only death. The Vispu dharmaputra (chap. 34 ) states that incest with the mother, daughter or daughter-in-law is atipātaka, such sinners have to

enter fire and there is no other penance for this sin. Vide Gaut. 21. 7 also. Some smrtis held that there was no prāyasoitta for certain grave sins except falling from a precipice or into fire. As a brahmana's person became more and more sacred with the march of time, death ceased to be a penance for a brāhmaṇa ginner, however grave the sin might be. But this did not apply to a kṣatriya or any one else (other than a brahmana). 

20. *Pollution through contact with a sinner' (1.15). Manu XI. 180 ( Santi 165, 37 = Baud. Dh, S, II. 1. 88 ), 1825 Viṣnu Dh. S. 35, 2-5 provide that if a person continues for one year in close association ( sarsarga) with one guilty of the grave sins ( enumerated in Manu XI. 54 ), in respect of occupy ing the same conveyance or seat with him or dining in the same row with him he becomes patita; but he becomes patita immediately if he officiates as a priest. for such a sinner or performs his upanayana for teaching him the sacred Gāyatri and the Veda or if he enters into a matrimonial alliance with him, Parāśara ( I. 25-26 ) states that in the Kfta age a person became patita by speaking with a patita, in Tretā by seeing him, in Dyāpara by pārtaking of food prepared in his house, but in Kali by actually committing a (sinful ) deed and that when a grave sin was committed by a man, in the Kṛta age the whole district in which he lived was to be abandoned, in Tretā the village, in Dvāpara his family alone and in Kali only the perpetrator. 1826 Parāśara ( XII. 79 ) no doubt 1827 says that sins (i. e, pollutions are caused ) are transferred, as a drop of oil ( spreads ) on water, by sitting or sleeping together or by using the same conveyance, by speaking with or by dining in the same row with a sinner'; but this only means that to associate with a sinner is bad, but it does not mean that to associate with a patita immediately makes the associator himself a patita. The Mit. on Yaj. III. 261 quotes Devala 1828 and Vfddha-Bșhaspati to the effect

that samsarga arises in nine ways viz. by talk, by touch, by breathing the same air (i. e. by being in the same room ), by being in the same conveyance or on the same seat or bed, by dining in the same row, by being a sinner's priest or vedic teacher or entering into matrimonial alliance with him. The Par. M. says that Parāśara held the view that there was no pātitya by the various kinds of contact in Kali and so provided do prāyaścitta for samsarga. The Nirnayasindhu 1829 and Bhattoji make similar remarks. The Udvāhatattva says that Parāśara I 25 is to be interpreted in this way that merely speaking or touching a patita or receiving money from him does not make another liable to any prāyascitta, but that if the association with a patita goes quite beyond these, then sin may be incurred by association. So almost all the digests are agreed that the rigour of the very strict rules about samsarga in Manu and Baud. was modified by declaring that speech with or sight of a sinner involved no sin in Kali. 1830 

21. "Undergoing (secret) expiation for the grave sing (mabāpātakas) except theft' (1. 15). Harita ( q. by Par. M. II. 1831 part 2, p. 153 ) prescribes secret expiation for a brāhmaṇa who has studied dharmaśāstra and committed a sin without anyone knowing it. Gaut. (chap. 24) prescribes certain expiations to be undergone secretly (without any third person knowing of such performance ) for even mahāpātakas such as brāhmaṇa murder, drinking surā, incest and theft of gold. Vas. (chap, 25) also does the game and states ( 25. 2) that only those who have kept the sacred vedic fires, who are disciplined and old or learned are entitled to secret expiations for sins and not other people. The Vispu Dh. 8. 55 deals with seoret expiations. Parāśara IX. 61 (last verse) laid down 1832 the general rule that one should openly

declare one's sin. The Kalivarjya text provides that secret expia. tion is allowed as regards only theft among the mahāpātakas in the Kali age, though in earlier ages it was allowed as to other mahāpatakas also. The Nirnayasindhu says that secret expia tion is allowed only to brāhmaṇas. According to the Dharma sindhu, in the Kali age if a man is guilty of the murder of a brāhmaṇa or of other mahāpatakas he does not avoid the conse quences of falling into Hell when he undergoes an expiation but he becomes only fit for social intercourse, while as regards theft of gold ( a mahāpātaka ) by undergoing prāyaścitta he avoids the fall into hell and also becomes fit for social intercourse. The Kalivarjyayinirpaya appears to hold that all secret expia tions are forbidden in Kali, 1833 

22. "The act of offering an animal with the recital of Vedic mantras to the bridegroom, to a guest and in honour of pitrs' (1. 16).1834 Madhuparka was offered in ancient times on several occasions and to several persons such as to ștviks at sacri fices, to the king, to a snātaka, to one's ācārya, father-in-law, paternal or maternal uncle and to a bridegroom. Vide H. of Dh. vol. II. pp. 542-546 for details about Madhuparka. Originally a cow or a bull was killed for an honoured guest, later on when the cow came to be extremely sacred the flesh of some other animal was offered; when flesh-eating itself came to be looked down upon then only payasa and other vegetarian eatables came to be prescribed. Vide H. of Dh. vol. II pp. 777-782 on flesh-eating. This half line forbids the offering of flesh to a bridegroom or to an honoured guest (in madhuparka) and the feeding of

brālimaṇas with flesh at śrāddhas. Comparatively so late a writer as Yāj. (I. 258-259 ) extols the high gratification that the Manes feel when flesh of various animals is offered in śrāddhas. This one prohibition includes in itself several prohibitions that are separately mentioned in other texts such as govadha' (in notes 1797 and 1799), the killing of an animal in a Madhuparka (in n. 1798), 'gavalambba' and 'palapaitrka' (in note 1802). It is noteworthy that even so late as the first half of the 17th century Viśvanātha, a great logician, takes up the cudgels on behalf of flesh-eating by brāhmaṇas in sacrifices, sraddha, madhuparka, in danger to life and when ordered by a brāhmaṇa and charges those who totally forbid flesh-eating with being the followers of the doctrines of Bauddhas, while the latter at the same time prescribe expiations for even murderers of brāhmaṇas through greed of money and marry their maternal uncle's daughters or other sapiṇdas of their mother, though both of these latter are forbidden by the Kalivarjya texts. 1885 

23. Association with those that are guilty of intercourse with women who are not of the same varpa, even though the former may have undergone proper expiation for the lapse' (1. 18). There was great divergence of views as regards the prāgasoitta for adultery by a male with a female of the same olags, of a higher class or of a lower class. Further the ancient gūtras were rather hard on the guilty parties, the harsh rules being relaxed by later smrti writers. For example, Gaut. 23. 14-15 and Vas. 21. 1-3 prescribe for a male of a lower caste having intercourse with a woman of a higher caste death in Various ways. If a brāhmaṇa had sexual intercourse with a cāndala or svapāka woman Parāśara (X. 5–7) prescribes that he bas to undergo a fast for three days, tonsure of the head together with the top knot, three Prājāpatyas, Brahmakūrca, feeding brāhmaṇas, constant recital of the Gāyatri, gift of two pairs of cows and then he becomes pure, while a sūdra doing the same had to undergo the expiation of one Prājāpatya and had to make a

gift of two cows. If a person of a low caste has intercourse with & woman of a higher caste ( e. g. a sūdra has intercourse with a brāhmaṇa woman) Samyarta ( verses 166-167 ) prescribes the expiation of subsisting for a month on cow's urine and yāvaka (barley gruel) for him. If a brāhmaṇa commits adultery with a śūdra or cāndala woman Samvarta (verses 169-170) prescribes the expiation of cāndrāyaṇa, while Parāśara (X. 17-20) prescribes a far more severe expiation. The present text prescribes that, even after undergoing expiation, men guilty of intercourse with women of castes other than their own cannot be allowed to have social intercourse with their castemen, The Dharmasindhu 1836 says that śūdras that have intercourse with brāhmaṇa or other women of a higher caste are hereby declared to be unfit for social inter course even after they undergo expiation. This no doubt made for strictness in morals, but it also led to the preservation of caste exclusiveness. 

24. 'Abandonment of a mother (or other woman who is to be honoured owing to relationship) because she has had sexual intercourse with one of low class' (1. 19). 

The provisions of the sūtras and smstis on the subject of expiation for adultery by women varied from time to time. Gaut. 23. 14 and Manu VIII. 371 prescribe that a woman who has intercourse with a man of low caste is to be punished by the king with being devoured by dogs. But other smrtis and Manu himself (XI. 177) are not so harsh, but are rather humano in their treatment of adulteresses. Manu XI. 176 says that the husband should keep confined to one apartment his corrupt wife and compel her to perform the expiation which is prescribed for males in cases of adultery. Manu XI. 59 and Yāj. III. 235 regard adultery by a male (pāradārya) as an upapātaka and Manu XI. 117 and Yaj. III. 265 prescribe cāndrāyana as an expiation for all upapātakas. Vas. XXI. 12 prescribes that the wives of men of the three higher castes who are guilty of adultery with a sūdra may be purified by an expiation. if no child is born of the intercourse but not otherwise. Yāj. I. 72 provides that a woman becomes free from the taint of adultery when she has her monthly illness after the adultery but if she conceives in adulterous intercourse she may be abandoned. The Mit. on Yāj. I. 72 states that both Yaj. and Vas. are to be

(Vol. 

understood in the same sense and abandonment does not mean driving out of the house but only not allowing her to participate in religious acts and not having sexual intercourse with her. Vas. XXI. 10 states that only four kinds of women are to be abandon ed, viz. one who has intercourse with the husband's pupil or with the husband's guru, one who attempts to kill her husband or one who commits adultery with a man of a degraded caste. Yāj. (III. 296–7 ) provides that to women that are patita the same rules apply as to men, but they should be given food, raiment and protection and that intercourse with a man of low caste is one of the three gravest sins for women. Vide Mit. on Yaj. III. 297. The present text states that a woman (such as a mother) who is entitled to honour from a person because of her relation ship ( as mother, elder sister etc. ) is not to be abandoned and cast on the street by him, although she may be guilty of adultery with a degraded or low caste man, in spite of Vas. XXI. 10 and other texts (such as Br. ). 1837 That is, this text was more humane to such women than ancient texte. Krspa bhatta explains that 'gurustriyāḥ' means of a brāhmaṇa woman'. Vide H. of Dh. vol. II pp. 571-573 for further remarks on adulterous women. Ap. Dh, s. I. 10. 28.9 requires the son always to serve and wait upon the mother even though she may be patita. Atri 1838 (195-196) and Devala (50-51) contain two Verges (almost in the same words ) which are lax as compared with other ancient texts. They say: "If a woman conceives through intercourse with a male who is not of her caste, she becomes impure till her delivery. When she is delivered or she has her monthly illness after the intercourse she becomes like pure gold'. Atri (197-198 ) further provides that whether a woman willingly has sexual intercourse or is deceived or is enjoyed against her will or in secret, she should not be abandoned; one should wait till the monthly illness and she becomes purified by that illness'.

the later smitis of Devala and Atri is remedied by this Kali varjya text which forbids abandonment of only such women as the mother, but allows the abandonment of others when guilty of intercourse with a male of low caste. Devala prescribes expiation by sāntapana in the case of those women that are raped by mlecchas and conceive (verses 47-49 ). Vide also Atri 201-202. The Sm. Kau. restricts this half verse to the mother alone. Parāśara ( X 24-25) prescribes that if a woman be raped once she becomes free from pollution by undergoing Prajapatya after she has her monthly illness and in other cases of rape she has to undergo Santapana. 

25. 'Sacrificing one's life for the sake of another' (1. 20). The Visnu Dh, S. III. 45 states 1839 that those who are killed in saving the life of a cow, a brāhmaṇa, the king, a friend, one's wealth and one's wife go to heaven and XVI. 18 provides that even those (untouchables) who are outside (the pale of the four varṇas) and sacrifice their life for brāhmaṇas, for cows and for women and children attain heaven. The Adityapurāṇa quoted in Rājadbarınakśṇda (p. 91 ) has a similar verse. The Samaya mayūkha and Bhattoji quote a smrti, 'one should at once saori fice one's life for cows and brāhmanas, 1840 This text forbids self-sacrifice of one's life simply for the promised reward of heaven in the cases specified. The K. V. N. (folio 9b) offers two more (rather far-fetched) explanations of this phrase, one of which is offering one's services as a serf to another. This is probibited to members of the three twice-born classes in Kali, but not to the sūdras, acc. to K. V. N. 

26. 'Offering (of food) to another that remains after one has partaken of it' (1. 20). In the Madhuparka the honoured guest used to partake of a part of the offering of honey, milk

and curds and was to give the remainder to a brāhmaṇa (or a son or a younger brother). This is prohibited by this Kalivarjya text. Vide H. of Dh. vol. II. p. 544 for this practice. Ap. Dh. S.( I. 1. 4. 1-6) provides that the pupil may partake of the leavings of his teacher's food, but the teacher should not give him honey or meat or other food which will be opposed to the observances of a vedio student. The Nirnayasindhu reads 'uddistasyāpi varjanam'1841, which means 'not accepting what has been donated,' Yāj, I. 213 says that if a person worthy of accepting a gift does not keep it for himself (but passes it on to others), he secures the highest worlds obtained by those who make generous gifts. Bhattoji gives another explanation. Vas (14, 21 ) forbids a man to eat the remnants of his own food or to eat food that comes in contact with the leavings of food. This Kalivariya text sets aside for the Kali age the prohibition con tained in Vas. 14, 21 (acc. to Bhattoji). The K. V. N. (folio 10 a) states that this is the explanation given by some, but does not approve of it. The Sm. Kau. gives yet another but extremely far-fetched explanation. 1842 These several explanations of the same half verse indicate how some of the Kalivarjya texts are comparatively recent and have no settled meaning even accord ing to comparatively late writers of digests. 

27. "The resolve to offer worship (throughout life ) with various details to a certain idol (1.21 ). 

It is not easy to see why such a resolve should have been prohibited. Therefore this explanation given by Bhattoji, K. V. N. (folio 10 a), the Samayamayakha and others is not satisfac tory. It is better to accept the explanation of the Nir. S. that this forbids the undertaking of the worship of a particular image for wages. Aparārka (pp. 450 and 923) quotes a smrti text defin ing a devalaka as a brāhmaṇa who performs the worship of an

to officiate at $rāddhas.1843 Manu III. 152 declares the devalaka to be unfit for being invited for śrāddhas or rites in honour of gods and Kullūka quotes Devala to the effect that one who maintains himself on the treasury of a shrine is called deyalaka. It is remarkable that Vṛddha-Harita (VIII. 77-80) says that only the worshippers of Siva for wages are called devalaka and those of Visnu are not. Acc, to the Sm. Kau. what is forbidden is the resolve to worship an image for securing a direct vision of the Deity.1814 This is rather pedantio and far-fetched. 

28. Touching the bodies of those ( who are impure on the death of a relative ) after the collection of the bones' (1.22 ). The day on which the bones were to be collected after the body was cremated differed greatly according to various writers. The Mit. on Yaj. III. 17 notes that according to Saṁyarta 1845 (verse 38) the bones may be collected on the first, third, seventh or 9th day, that the Viṣnu Dh. S. (19. 10-11) prescribes the 4th day for it and recommends the casting of them into the Ganges, that some did it on the 2nd day and that therefore everyone should follow his own Gșhyasūtra. The Mit. on Yaj. III. 18 quotes Devala to the effect that, after the lapse of one-third of the period of impurity prescribed for members of the four varnas (as in Yaj. III. 22), persons who lost relatives become touchable, that members of the four varnas become touchable in three, four, five and ten days respectively. Samyarta (verses 39-40) states that, after the collection of bones, touching those who are under pollution due to death is allowed on the 4th, 6th, 8th and 10th day respectively in the case of brāhmaṇas, ksatriyas, vaisyas and sūdras. The present Kalivarjya text forbids this and becomes stricter as to the rules about impurity.

History of Dharnasāstra 

[Vol. 

The animal in a grauta sacrifice was to be killed by choking it and strangling it. The person who did so was called samitr. Different views were entertained as to who was to be the samitr, Acc, to Jai. III. 7. 28-29 1846 the adhvaryu himself was to be the samits; the usual opinion was that he was to be some one other than the striks. The Āśv. Sr. (XII. 9. 12-13) shows that he may be a brāhmaṇa or a non-brāhmaṇa. For further details vide H. of Dh. vol. II. pp. 1121-22, n. 2504. As animal sacrifices themselves came to be looked down upon or even forbidden, this text forbids a brāhmaṇa from being a samitr. 

30. The sale of the soma plant by brāhmaṇas' (1.23). 

Soma beverage was to be drunk only by brāhmaṇas. The soma plant had to be purchased and there was a symbolic haggling for it. The vendor of soma in ancient1847 times was, aoo. to Kāt. Sr. VII. 6. 2-4 and Ap. Śr. X. 20.12, either a brāhmaṇa of Kutsa gotra or any brāhmana or a sūdra.1847 In later times, though Manu XI. 7 ( = Sānti.165, 7 ) and Nār. ( dattāpradānika 7 ) 1848 allow a brāhmaṇa who has wealth sufficient for the maintenance of himself and his dependents for three years or more to perform a soma sacrifice, yet Manu III. 158, Yaj. I. 165 and Vas. 14. 3 hold that a brābmana who sells the soma plant is unfit to be invited at a śrāddha and that one should not partake of food at his house. Manu X. 88 forbids a brāhmaṇa to sell water, arms, poison, soma &c. Vide H. of Dh. vol. II. pp. 1141-1143 for purchase of soma and the dramatic haggling for it. 

31. 'Allowing a brāhmaṇa householder to eat food at the houses of four classes of people among sūdras viz, his slave, his cowherd, a hereditary family friend and one who cultivates his fields on the basis of paying a half or other portion of the produce to him' ( 11. 25–26 ). 

Gaut. 17. 6, Manu IV. 253 (=Viṣṇu Dh. S. 1849 57. 16), Yāj. I. 166 and Parāśara XI. 19 say that a brāhmaṇa may eat the

food of these four and of his own barber. Haradatta on Gaut. 17, 6 and Aparārka (p. 244 ) remark that a brāhmapa can take the food of these persons among sūdras only in the event of extreme calamities. From this it appears that up to the 12th century A. D. the peremptory prohibition contained in this text was either unknown or was not much respected. The exclusive ness of caste in matters of food and marriage was made more strict by the Kalivarjya texts. Vide above ( pp. 869 and 885 ) as to how Parāśara himself was overruled by this text. 

32. 'Pilgrimages to very distant holy places '(1. 26). 

A brāhmaṇa was called upon to tend his Vedic or grhya fires. If he went to distant places on pilgrimage this duty would be interfered with. It is provided by Ap. 1850 Sr. IV. 16. 18 that even when on a journey the agnihotrin has, after turning his face in the direction of his fire altar, to go mentally over the whole procedure of his daily fire worship and the Darśa pūrṣamāsa. The Gobhila-smrti II. 157 says the same. The Smstikaustubha 1851 says that this prohibits pilgrimage to holy places beyond the sea or on the borders of Bharatavarṣa. This text prohibits a brāhmaṇa from going to distant places on pilgrimage, but it does not prevent him from undertaking & journey for earning wealth for performing sacrifices. K. V. N. (folio 10a ) quotes a text of Satyavrata to this effect. 

33. *The rule that a pupil should habitually observe the same behaviour towards the wife of the guru as towards the guru himself (1.7). Ap. Dh. 1852 S. I. 2.7. 27, Gaut. II. 31-34, Manu II, 210, Viṣṇu Dh. S. 32. 1-2 prescribe that a student should perform the same acts of honour and obedience towards the wife or wives of his teacher as towards the teacher (except holding her feet in doing obeisance and eating the leavings of the food). As students were often grown-up young men and the teacher's wife might often be a young lady, Manu II. 212,

History of Dharmaśāstra 

(Vol. 

216, 217 ( that are the same as Viṣnu Dh. S. 32. 13-15) provide that a pupil full twenty years old should not show honour to the young wife of his teacher by clasping her feet, but that he may prostrate himself on the ground before the teacher's young wife in performing obeisance and that he may hold her feet in obeisance only (once) when he returns from a journey. This text accepts the principle underlying the special rules laid down by Manu and Viṣnu and prohibits the daily touching of the feet of the guru's wife on the part of the pupil. The Sm. 1853 Kau. and Dharmasindhu (III p. 353 ) hold that this sets aside the rule laid down in Yāj I. 49 that a perpetual student may stay till his death with his teacher or with the teacher's son or (in default of both ) with the teacher's wife. 

34. "The modes of maintenance conceded to brāhmaṇas in times of distress (or calamity)' (1.28). 

The special modes of maintenance prescribed for brāli mapas were receiving gifts, teaching the Veda and officiating as priests (Gaut. X. %, Āp. Dh. S. II. 5. 10. 5, Manu X. 76, I. 88, Vas. II. 14, Yaj. I. 118). But it was recognised from very ancient times that if a brāhmaṇa could not maintain himself by following the above modes of earning wealth he could in a season of distress pursue the avocations peculiar to a ksatriya or vaisya (Gaut. VII. 6-7, Baud. Db. S. II. 2. 77-81, Vas. II. 22, Manu X, 81-82, Yaj. III. 35 ) 1854 Vide H. of Dh. vol. II. pp. 118 133 for detailed treatment of this matter and for the restric tions imposed even when brāhmaṇas were allowed to follow the avocations of ksatriyas and vaisyas. The Kalivarjya prohibi tion is merely one on paper. From ancient times till now brahmanas have pursued all sorts of avocations and hardly any importance has been attached to this dictum. 

35. *Not acoumulating any wealth (or grains) for the morrow' (1.28). Manu IV.7 and Yāj. I. 128 provide that brāh manas are of four kinds, viz. those who acoumulate grain of the capacity of a kusula, those who accumulate grain of the capa city of a kumbhi, those that accumulate grain enough to satisfy

their needs for three days and those who do not collect grain even for the next day. The smṛtis prescribe that each later one is superior in merit to each preceding one. The commen tators differ as to the meaning conveyed by kugūladhānya (some holding that it means one who has accumulated grain for three years, while others say it means one who has grain for 12 days) and kumbhidhānya (a person accumulating grain for a year, or grain for six days). Vide H. of Dh, vol. II. p. 110, note 234 and p. 641 note 1502. The Mit. on Yāj. I. 128 says that the advice not to accumulate corn even for three days or one day is not addressed to all brāhmaṇas, but to those only who are called yāykvara 1855. This explanation of the Mit. indicates that the Kalivariya text on this point was either not known to the Mit. or was not much thought of by it. The Kalivarjya text provides that the ideal of extreme poverty and absence of acquisitiveness for brāhmaṇas was not to be insisted upon in the Kali age. 

36. 'The acceptance of the kindling of a log of wood (i. e. setting up sacred Vedic fire) at the time of the homa of Jatakarma for the purpose of securing long life to the child born to a person' (1. 29). The aranis are two logs of Aśvattha tree from which fire is produced by attrition, which (fire) is used for kindling the gārhapatya fire. In certain sākhās, it is the prac tice to kindle fire from aranis and to use it for the homa in the Jātakarma rite. This fire was to be used in the subsequent rites for the child such as cūda, upanayana, marriage. It was supposed that this enabled the child to live long. 1856 The Sam K. quotes a parisista text to this effect.1857 

37. 'Constant journeys by brāhmaṇas' (1. 30). The Mahābhārata (Santi 23. 15 ) 1858 says, 'As a snake swallows mice hiding in holes, the earth swallows two persons viz, a king who does not fight (an invader) and a brāhmaṇa who does not engage

in travel' (for acquiring learning from famous teachers). This text only forbids taking aimlessly to long journeys but not those for study or for religious purposes. 

38. 'Blowing on fire with the mouth' in order to kindle it into flames (1 30 ). Gaut. IX. 32, Manu IV, 53 and Brahmapurāna 221. 102 forbid the blowing on fire with the mouth ( as in doing so it is likely that drops of saliva from the mouth may fall into the fire and pollute it). Haradatta on Ap. Dh. S. I. 5. 15. 20 notices that in the Vājasaneya Sākhā it is said that fire should be kindled into flames by blowing upon it with the breath from the mouth since it sprang from the mouth of the Creator (as stated in the Puruṣagūkta, Rg. X. 90. 13). Therefore, acc. to Haradata and the Gobhila-smrti (I. 135-136) 1859 the srauta fire could be kindled by blowing upon it with the mouth, but smārta fire or ordinary fire should not be kindled in that way (but only by using a fan or a bamboo cylindrical piece ). The Kalivariya text forbids blowing with the niouth even on srauta fire. 

39. ' Allowing social intercourse to women who have become polluted by rape and the like(when they have performed prāyasoitta) as prescribed in the sāstras' (1. 31).1860 Vas. 28. 2-3 state,' when a woman is polluted by being raped or kidnapp ed by a thief, she should not be abandoned; one should wait till her monthly illness (making her undergo certain expiations till then ) and she becomes pure after it.' Atri ( V.2-3) has the same verses, which are quoted (from Vas..) by Visvarūpa on Yāj. III. 256 (p. 133. Tri. ed.) and explained at great length. The Matsyapurāṇa 227. 126 is liberal enough to say that the man who commits rape should be punished with death but the woman raped incurs no blame. Parāśara ( X. 27 ) provides that if a woman is raped by an evil-doer only once she becomes pure by undergoing the Prā jāpatya expiation and after the follow ing monthly illness. Even so late a smrti writer as Davala provides that if a woman of any class is raped by mlecchas and she conceives she can be purified by the expiation of Santapana.

40. 'Begging of food by a sannyāsin from members of all varpas (including sūdras ) according to the rules of the śāstra' (1.32). The Sm. M. p. 201 (on varṇasrama) quotes Kathaka Brāhmaṇa, 1861 Āruṇi Up., Parāsara ( in prose) to the effect that a yati may beg for food from members of all varṇas. Baud. Dh. S. II. 10.69 1862 also quotes a verse which allows the begging of food from all varṇas to a yati. Vas. X. 7 requires a yati to beg at seven houses not selected beforehand and in X. 24 states that he should subsist on what food he gets at the houses of brāhmapas. 1863 The present text requires even the yati to observe caste rules as to food. 

41. 'Not using for ten days fresh rain water' (1. 33). Haradatta on Ap. Dh. S. L 5. 15. 2, Bhattoji on Catur. (p. 54), Sm. Kau. p. 479 quote a verse,' she-goats, cows, she-buffaloes and brāhmaṇa women become free from impurity (due to delivery ) after ten nights and so does fresh rain water accumulated on the ground'. According to this the long period of ten days in the case of rain water is set aside. But Bhattoji notes that accord ing to another smrti 'rain water falling at the proper season is pure, but it is not to be used for drinking for three days; when rain falls at an unusual season rain water is impure for ten days and if a man drinks it within that period he should abstain from food for one day and night'. Bhattoji remarks that the Kalivarjya text only sets aside waiting for ten days, but does not set aside the rule against drinking it for three days.

History of Dharmasastra 

[Vol 

The ancient practice was to make no agreement as to fees for teaching. Vide Bs. Up. IV. 1.2. Gaut. (II. 54-55) prescribes 1865 that at the end of his studies the student should request the 

· teacher to accept the wealth that he could offer or ask the teacher what should be given and after paying or doing what was required by the guru or if the teacher permitted him to go without demanding anything the student' should take the ceremonial bath. Vide Manu II. 245-246 and H. of Dh. vol. II. pp. 360-361 for details. Yāj. I. 51 provides that at the end of his studies the student may give to the teacher what he desires (or a cow ) according to his ability or may with his permission take the ceremonial bath (without paying anything). On account of these provisions we have stories in the ancient litera ture that very rarely teachers or their wives made fanciful demands. This Kalivarjya text only gets aside the require ment of paying what the guru demands, but does not prohibit the voluntary gift of a fee by the student. 1866 

43. "The engagement of a sūdra for such acts as cooking and the like in the houses of brāhmaṇas and the rest' (1. 34). Ap. Dh. S. (II. 2. 3. 1-8) requires that 1867 the food for Vaiśva deva should be prepared by pure men of the first three yarnas and also optionally allows a sūdra to be a cook for an ārya pro vided he is under the supervision of men of the first three varpas, provided he sips water whenever he touches the hair, any limb or his garment, provided he cuts the hair (on his head and his body), the beard and nails every day or every 8th day of the month or on the new and full moon day and provided he bathes with the clothes on. It is this permission that is set aside by this Kalivariya text. 

44. Suicide of very old people by falling into fire or from a precipice' (1.35 ). 

This is analogous to No. 13 above. Atri did not condemn suicide in certain cases. He states, 1868 (verses 218-219) ' if one be

old ( beyond 70), if one cannot observe the rules of bodily puri fication (owing to extreme weakness), if one is so ill that all medical help is discarded, and if one in these circumstances kills himself by throwing himself from a precipice or into fire or water or by fasting, mourning should be observed for him for three days and śrāddha may be performed for him.' Apar ārka (p. 536 ) quotes several smṛtis to the effect that a very old man or one suffering from very serious illness, one who has no desires left and has carried out his tasks may bring about his death by entering firo or water or falling from a precipice and he will incur no sin. Vide H. of Dh, vol. II. pp. 926-92? for further details. This text may also be taken as forbidding suicide by falling from a precipice or into fire as an expiation in the case of those that are guilty of mahāpātakas knowingly committed. The Mit. on Yāj. III. 226 quotes a smrti to this effect 1869, The Suddhitattva holds (pp. 284-285) that suicide by entering water and the like is allowed in Kali only to śūdras and forbidden to brāhmaṇas and others. 

45. "The performance of acamana (purificatory sipping of water) by sistas in as much water as is sufficient for slaking the thirst of a cow' (1. 36). 

Manu V.128, Vas. III. 35, Baud. Dh, S. 1. 5. 65, Yāj. I. 192, Vispu 23. 43 provide 1870 that water collected on the ground is pure (and may be used for acamana) provided it is sufficient in quantity to slake the thirst of a cow. But this text forbids on hygienic grounds the use of small quantities of water collec ted on the ground for sipping and similar purposes, 

46. The residence of an ascetic in the house near which he happens to be in the evening' ( 1. 38). 

Aco, to Āp. Dh. S. II. 9. 21. 10 and Manu VI. 43, 55-56, an ascetic was to kindle no fire, was to be houseless and was to beg only once a day in the afternoon or evening when no smoke ascends from the kitchens of people, when the embers have been extinguished, when pöople have finished their meals &o.

History of Dharmasastra 

( Vol. 

12-15) provides 1871 that a sannyāsin was to change his residence frequently, was to stay at the boundary of the village or in a temple, or in an empty house or at the bottom of a tree and should constantly live in a forest. Saṅkha (VII. 6) states that an ascetic should stay in an empty house or he may stay wherever he may be when the sun sets. This provision of Saṅkha is set aside by the Kalivarjya text. Another meaning of the words, according to Kysnabhatta on the Nir. S. (p. 1310), is that this runs counter to the recommendation of Manu VI. 56 that an ascetic should go for begging to the houses in a village in the evening when all smoke from kitchens has ceased i. e. by this text he is allowed to beg in the noon. In a way this appears to be a better explanation. 

The above is a complete list of all Kalivarjyas quoted from the Adityapurāṇa (except one or two). Some of the Kalivarjyas not included here, but included in other texts cited above will also be now set out for the sake of completeness of treatment. 

47. 'Resorting to sannyāsa'. Vyāsa quoted above ( n. 1793) forbade sannyāsa in the Kali age after 4400 years of it had elapsed, but then Devala 1872 made an exception to this extent that as long as the division of society into four varnas existed and as long as the Veda was studied sannyāsa could be resorted to even in Kali. The Nir, 8. explains that what is forbidden is the sannyāsa with three dandas and not the sannyāsa with one danda. Baud. II. 10. 53 (ekadandi vā ) gives an option that a sannyāsin may carry three staffs or one, while Yāj. III. 58 speaks of a yati as only tridaṇdi. Daṣda meas a staff and also 'restraint, curbing". Manu XII. 10 (same as Dakṣa VII. 30) declares that that man is called tridandi who has restraint over his body, speech and mind. Dakṣa1873 also says that a yati is not called tridandi by carrying three bamboo staffs, that he is called tridapdi who has

the spiritual restraint in him (v. 29). In I. 12-13 Dakṣa says that just as a girdle, deer skin and a wooden staff are the outward signs of a vedic student, 80 three staffs are the peculiar sign of a yati. Vide H. of Dh, vol. II. pp. 937-938 for further details. If the Kalivarjya text were meant to forbid sannyāsa altogether, it must be said that it was never honoured and even now thousands become sanngāsins every year. If, as the Nir. S. says, this text only forbids the carrying of three daṇdas, it is a meaningless prohibition, giving importance only to outward symbols and not to the substance of the matter. 

48. "The observance of aynihotra' or the acceptance of three fires'. Vyāsa (n. 1793 ) forbade the performance of srauta agnihotra along with sannyāsu in Kali, but an exception was made by Devala in favour of its observance as also of resort to sapnyāsa on the grounds stated above (in No. 47). Some digests and authors such as the Nirṇayasindhu 1874 and Bhattoji explain that agnihotra of the sarvadhāna type is forbidden in Kali, but that of the ardhādhāna type is allowed. Agnihotra means 'adhāna', that is, setting up of the srauta fires. When a man consecrates the three srauta fires he may do so with half of his smārta fire and keep up the other half of the smārta fire. This is called ardhādhāna. If he does not keep the smārta fire separate, it is sarvīdhūna. Laugākṣi quoted by the Nir. S. (III. p. 370 ), Bhattoji and others states this. The Mit, on Yāj, III. 45 mentions these two modes. Therefore, according to these explana tions, sarvadhāna was allowed in former ages (and acc, to one interpretation up to 4400 years of Kali), while in Kali (or at least after 4400 years of Kali) only ardhādhana is allowed. 

49. 'Human sacrifice' (vide note 1798 giving extract from Nāradapurāna). 

The Tai. Br. 1875 ( 11I. 4. 1-19) contains a description of the procedure of human sacrifice. The oldest texts even do not show that a human being was killed. The whole procedure is

(Vol. 

symbolical. The Vāj. S. (XXX. 5 ff.) has many passages in common with the Tai. Br. The Tai. Br. III. 4.1( = Vaj. S. 30.5) begins,' the brāhmana should be offered to brahman (spiritual power ), the ksatriya to ksatra (military power), the vaisya to the Maruts' &c. Acc. to Āp. Śr. XX. 24, a brāhmana or ksatriya performs this sacrifice, whereby he attains power and valour and all prosperity. There are eleven sacrificial posts and eleven animals to be offered to Agni and Soma. After the rite of paryugnikarana is performed on the brāhmaṇa and others, they are presented to the several deities and then discharged from the sacrificial posts, eleven goats are killed and oblations of their flesh and limbs are offered. Acc. to the coin, on Vāj. S., it is begun on the 10th day of the bright half of Caitra and goes on for 40 days, which are occupied with 23 diksās, 12 upasads and five sutyas ( days on which soma is extracted). After this yāga, the yajamāna usually resorted to a forest as a sannyāsin. 1876 

50. “Aśvamedha'(n. 1798). The Tai, S. V.3.12.2 states, 1877 "he who performs the Asvamedha becomes free from (the sin of) brahmana murder'. In spite of this Vedio authority the Bphan Nāradiya and other purānas prohibited it. But no one heeded this prohibition and numerous historio kings performed this sacrifice from at least 200 B, O, to Jayasing in the 18th century A. D. Vide H. of Dh. vol. II. pp. 1238-1239 and .pp. 70-71 above for numerous historical performers of Aśvamedha. 

51. "Rājasūya' (acc. to the Garudapurāna, p. 929 above). This was a very complex rite extending over two years and could be performed only by a ksatriya. Vide H. of Dh. vol. II. pp. 1214-1223 for a brief description. The Rājasūya was per formed by the Kalinga Emperor Khāravela as he proclaims in his Hāthigumpha Inscription (E. I. vol. XX p. 71 at p. 79) and by queen Nayanikā as stated in the Nāṇāghāt Inscription (A. S. 

W. I. vol. V. p. 60). 

52. 'Perpetual studenthood' (n. 1798). Vedic students were of two kinds, upakurvāra ( who offered some return or fee at the time when they returned home) and the naiṣthika (who remained students till death). Vide p. 764 n. 1471 above,

Hārita, Dakṣa 1878 (1.7) and others mention these two varie ties, while Yaj. I. 49, Vedavyāsa I. 41 and Visnu Dh. 8. 28. 46 name and describe the naiṣthika. Manu II. 243-244, Yāj. I. 49-50, Vas. VII. 4-5 provide that a perpetual Vedic student should stay with his teacher till his own death, that on the teacher's death he should stay with the teacher's son or the teacher's wife or should tend fire, that if he curbs his senses till his death, he reaches the world of brahma (immortality) and is not born again. This was a very diffi cult mode of life, there were great temptations as the flesh is weak and therefore the Bphan-Nāradiya and others prohibited perpetual studenthood. Some works such as the Madanapārijāta (p. 16), the Kalivarjyavinirnaya of Damodara, and the Nir, S. read 'dirgha-kālam brahmacaryam' in place of 'naisthikam brahmacaryam' in the Bșhan-Naradiya. 

53. 'Brahmacarya for long periods' (n. 1799). The Baud. Dh, S. (1.7.1-5) declares, "the term of studentship for Veda study as observed in ancient times lasted for 48 years, or 24 years, or 12 years for each Veda or at least one year for each kāṇda (of the Tai.S.) or it lasted till the Veda was committed to memory, as life is evanescent and as the Veda ordains let him kindle the sacred fires while his hair is still black'." The Āp. Dh. S. (1. 1. %. 11-16 ) provides that the student's stay with the teacher's household should be 48 years, 24 years or 12 years at the lowest. Manu III. 1 also states that the vow of studying the three Vedas under a guru must be observed for 36 years or for half of that time or for a quarter of it or until the student has mastered (the Veda). These long periods of 48 years, 36 or 24 years for Veda study (before a man could become an house holder) are here forbidden in Kali. This was nothing new. Yāj. I. 36 had allowed 12 years for each Veda or five and if a man did not want to study all vedas but only one he could finish his studenthood in five years. Only an extremely small number could have spent 48 or 36 years in Veda study. Sabara on Jai. I. 3. 3 held that this text of Band. was opposed to the fruti about kindling fires when a man was a young householder with black hair and was to be discarded. Vide pp. 832–834 above for a

discussion of this. The authors of the Samayamayūkha and the Sm. Kau, both of whom had before them the reading *dirghakālam brahmacaryam' held that this prohibition was aimed at the words of Ap. and Baud. and that the vow of perpetual studentship which was undertaken with a special purpose in view ( viz. realization of brahma and non-return to samsūra) was not prohibited by the Kalivarjya text and that there was nothing wrong in the practice of perpetual student hood among the Dravidas. 

54. 'Animal sacrifice.' In the Mārkandeya as quoted in Apararka p. 929 above animal sacrifice was forbidden in the Kali age. Though popular feeling had gradually veered round to the view that meat should not be offered in śrāddhas, in madhuparka (No. 22 above), yet animal sacrifices were performed at all times and are even now performed, though very rarely. 

55. "Intoxicating drinks ( madya)'. There were startling vicissitudes in the attitude to intoxicants. 

In Vedic times soma was a beverage drunk by the priests and surā was a beverage for common men and usually not meant to be offered to the gods. Soma and surā are sharply distinguished (vide Tai, S. II. 5. 1. 1, Vāj. S. 19.7, Sat. Br. V. 1. 5. 28). The Sat. Br. (V. 1. 5. 28) has the striking antithesis 'For, Soma is truth, prosperity, light; and surā is untruth, misery, darkness'. In the Sautrāmaṇl iṣti a brāhmaṇa had to be hired for drinking the dregs of surā offered in it and if a brāhmaṇa could not be found the surā was poured on an ant hill (Tai. Br. I. 8. 6 and Sabara on Jai. III. 5. 14-15). It appears from the Kathaka-bambitā XII. 12 that 1879 brāhmaṇas had by that time come to regard the drinking of surā as sinful. From Chān. Up. V. 10.9 it appears that a drinker of surā was enumerated among five grave sinners. In the Asv. gr. II. 5. 3-5 it is said that in the rites of the Anvaṣtaka day when pindas are offered to the male ancestors, the female ancestors viz. the mother, the paternal grandmother and great-grandmother are offered surā and the scum of boiled rice in addition 1880. The Nir. S. (III.

p. 367) refers to this passage of the Aśy. Gr. and holds that the Kalivariya text against intoxicants forbids this also. 

Madya is a generic term applicable to all intoxicating drinks; surā is said to be of three kinds, viz. that prepared from molasses, that from honey (or madhūka flowers or from grapes) and that from corn flour (Manu XI. 94, Visṇu Dh, S. 22. 82 and Sasvarta 117 ). The Viṣṇu Dh. S. (22. 83-84) specifies ten kinds of madya, all of which a brāhmaṇa was not even to touch. Gaut. II. 25 1881, Ap. Dh, S. I. 5. 17. 21, Manu XI. 95 forbid all kinds of midya to brāhmaṇas at all stages of life. Ap. I. 7. 21. 8, Vas. I. 20, Manu XI. 54, Viṣnu Dh, S. 35. 1 hold that the drinking of surā is one of the five grave sins (mahāpātakas), while Yāj. III. 227 employs the word 'madya' in place of surā in this connection. Baud. Dh. S. I. 1. 22 however notes that among the five practices peculiar to the brāhmaṇas of the north was that of drinking rum and Baud, condemns it. The verses of Manu XI. 93–94 about the three kinds of surā have been the subject of frequent and varying interpretations. Visvarūpa on Yāj. III. 222, the Mit. on Yāj. III. 253, Aparārka p. 1069 and others establish that the word 'surā.' primarily applies to paiṣti ( liquor prepared from flour ) alone, that paiṣti is forbidden to all brāhmaṇas, kṣatriyas and vaisyas, that it is the drinking of paisti alone that constitutes a mahāpātaka, that all intoxi cating drinks are forbidden to brāhmaṇas in all ages, but in toxicants other than paiṣti ( such as those prepared from molasses or madhūka flowers) are not forbidden to ksatriyas and vaisyas. Manu XI. 93 says that surā is the refuse of cooked food ( rice); therefore members of the three higher castes should not drink surā. This clearly shows that Manu took surā as meaning only paisti ( liquor prepared from rice flour). The Viṣnu Dh. S. ( 22. 84) expressly says that kṣatriyas and vaibyas are not polluted by touching the ten kinds of madyas specified by it. In the Udyogaparva (595) both Vasudeva (Krṣṇa) and Arjuna are described as intoxicated by drinking the liquor prepared from honey and the Tantra vārtika establishes that there was nothing wrong in this as both were kṣatriyas. Intoxicants were not forbidden to sūdras. Brahmacarins of whatever varṇa had to abstain from intoxicants of all kinds. Aparārka 1882 (p. 63)

| Vol. 

after quoting the Brahmapurāṇa states that intoxicating drinks were forbidden to the three varnas in Kali and to brāhmanas in all yugas (ages). But this is opposed to tradition. The Adiparva (chap. 76 ) narrates 1883 that Sukrācārya prohibited for the first time brāhmaṇas from drinking intoxicants (vide H. Dh. vol. II. pp. 792-799 for detailed discussion of this topic). The Kalivarjya text forbids the drinking of intoxicants to all the three twice-born classes. But ksatriyas and vaisyas pay scant attention to this prohibition and even some brāhmaṇas in these days have taken to drink as a fashionable indulgence. The K. V, N. (folio 5a), Krsnabhatta 1884 and Sm. Kau, note that in the sākta treatises (called Vāmāgama) madya is allowed to be offered to the idol for all the three varnas and to ksatriyas in the propitiatory rites for Vināyaka and for birth on the Mūla con stellation but this kalivarjya text forbids all that. 

An analysis of these 55 kalivarjyas yields very interesting results. About one-fourth out of the above 55 relate to Srauta matters. There are several texts forbidding Agnihotra, Aśvamedha, Rajasūya, Puruṣamedha, sattras, Gogava, animal sacrifices, while a few others are concerned with matters of detail in sacrifices (vide. No. 11, 14-16, 29-30, 38, 48-51, 54). The first nine of these 55 are concerned with legal matters and relations. Some prohibitions are due to growing caste exclusive ness ( No. 5, 10, 31, 40, 43). Others again spring from ideas of greater insistence on the sacredness of the marriage tie, a stricter morality and a demand for greater decency and purity, particularly in women ( No. 2, 3, 4, 9, 15, 23, 24, 33, 39, 55 ). A few are based on notions of compassion, justice and equity (No. 1, 8, 24, 25, 42). Some owe their origin to the growing sacredness of the brāhmaṇa's person and his high social position (No. 7, 10, 27, 29, 30). Some must have been suggested by hygienic considerations (No. 12, 16, 28, 38, 41, 45), some arose from strict ideas of sin, expiation and ceremonial purity and impurity (No. 13, 18-21, 28, 44). Two of these, when they

prohibit the stage of forest hermit and of sannyaga, strike at the very root of the ancient scheme of āśramas. 

The chapter on Kalivarjyas can be employed as a very effective answer to those who trot out the theory of the 'unchang ing East'. Social ideas and practices undergo substantial changes even in the most static societies. Many of the practic es, that had the authority of the Veda (which was supposed to be self-existent and eternal) and of such ancient smṛtis as those of Ap., Manu and Yāj., had either come to be given up or had become obnoxious to popular sentiment. This fiction of great men meeting together and laying down conventions for the Kali age was the method that was hit upon to admit changes in religious practices and ideas of morality. The Kalivarjya texts are also a complete answer to those who hold fast to the notion that dbarına (particularly ācāradharma ) is immutable and un changeable (aparivartaniya). This chapter on Kalivarjya unmistakably shows how the most authoritative dicta of the Veda and of ancient sages and law-givers were set aside and held to be of no binding authority because they ran counter to prevailing notions and furnishes a powerful weapon in the hands of those who want to introduce reforms in the incidents of marriage, inheritance and other matters touching modern Hindu society. One can further see how some practices still persist in spite of the prohibitions in the Kalivarjya texts viz. marriage with one's maternal uncle's daughter, sannyāsa, agnihotra and even srauta animal sacrifices (rarely). 

Some works add two more to the Kalivarjya verses which mean, 'imprecations, omens, dreams, palmistry, listening for supernatural voices or messages, promises to make presents to a deity if a certain prayer were granted, prophetic replies by astrologers to questions, may rarely turn out to be true. One should not, however, resort to these through the desire to secure results from them. Similarly there are other actions also (that have to be abandoned) in the Kali age, because they have come to be 

included (by people ) under improper acts (adharma).' 1885

From the fact that no ancient smrti speaks of Kalivarjya, that the ancient commentaries of Visvarūpa, Medhatithi and even Vijñānesvara do not cite long lists of Kalivarjyas, that such lists first make their appearance in the Smartyarthasara, the Sm. C. and Hemādri ( works and authors of 12th and 13th centuries), the most probable inference is that these lists of Kalivariyas were first put together at the earliest in the 10th or 11th century A.

1886. An attempt at a systematical collection of the Kalivarjya texts and elucidation thereof was made by me in a paper submitted to the 8th All ladia Oriental Conference held at Mysore in December 1935. The paper was published in the Journal of the Bombay Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society, vol. 12 pp. 1-18 (New Series ), 1936. Recently ( 1943 ) Mr. Batuknath Bhattacharya has published a book which contains a full treatment of Kalivarjyas. He states in the preface that it is an exact reprint of the thesis for Jogendrachandra Ghose Research Prize in Comparative Indian Law for 1933', that the subject is comparatively fresh and unexplored' and that the treatment is on lines marked out by the writer himself. He claims that bis work is 'original as a whole except one sec tion on secondary sons'. He does not state exactly in what year the thesis for a prize of 1933 was submitted to the Calcutta University. Presumably a thesis for a prize of 1933 should have been submitted in 1934 or 1935 at the latest. No satisfactory explanation is given why the thesis was published in 1943, so long after the year of the prize, nor does he mention my paper published so far back as 1936. It appears from quotations in tbe book as printed that it was probably retouched, if not actually written, after 1937. For example, on p. 76 be quotes a passage from the Smrtimuktāphala (section on Varnāsrama p. 201 ), which was published by Principal J. R. Gharpuré only in 1937 in Devanagari. If the original thesis was written or revised in or after 1937 my paper published in 1936 should have been mentioned. Mr. Batuknath Bhattacharya in his paper 'the sources of dharma and their comparative authority' published in the Proceedings of the 10th Oriental Conforence at Tirupati beld in 1940 refers to my paper on Kalivarjyas (p. 160 ) as 'brief and compact'. This shows that he knew my paper years before he published his work in 1943. The claim of the subject belag * unexplorod' and the thesis being ' original' is bardly admissible. 

## 35 Customs in Modern Indian Law

CHAPTER XXXV 

CUSTOMS IN MODERN INDIAN LAW 

Though an elaborate treatment of customs in niodern Anglo-Indian Law is far beyond the scope of the present work, yet a few words on customs in modern times may not be altogether out of place here. When the British began to acquire political domination in India they realized the importance attach. ed to customs by all persons in India and the Charter of the Mayor's court at Bombay in 1753, unconsciously following the ancient dicta of Manu (VII. 203 ) and Yaj. (I. 343), contains the earliest trace in British royal charters of a reservation to the peoples of India of their laws and customs. 1887 The British Parliament and the Indian Legislatures have allowed customs to occupy a very high place in the administration of law and justice. The preamble to 21 Geo. III chap. 70 ( 1781 A. D.). recited that one of the purposes for which the Act was passed was that the inhabitants of Bengal, Bihar and Orissa should be maintained and protected in the enjoyment of all their laws, usages, rights and privileges and sec. 17 of that Act provided among other things that, in the case of the inhabitants of Calcutta, their inheritance and succession to lands, rents and goods and all matters of contract and dealing between party, and party shall be determined in the case of Mahomedans by the laws and usages of Mahomedans and in the case of Gentus by the laws and usages of Gentus 1888 and, where only one of the parties shall be a Mahomedan or Gentu, by the laws and usages of the defendant. 37 Geo.

The burden of proving a custom opposed to the general law or in derogation of the ordinary rights of another lies heavily on the person alleging it, 1889 The decided cases lay down several essentials of a valid custom. In order to make a particular custom valid it must be proved to be immemorial or ancient, uniform, certain, reasonable, obligatory and it must not be immoral or opposed to public policy or to any express enactment of the Legislature. What antiquity must be proved before a custom can be accepted as valid depends upon the circumstances of each case, 1890 When it is said that a custom must be ancient it is not meant that the antiquity must be darried back to a period beyond the memory of man. According to the Mit. on Yāj. II. 27 smārta-kāla (time within living memory) in relation to possession means a period of one hundred years, while according to Katyāyana and Vyāsa it is only a period of sixty years. 1891 On evidence of the prevalence of a custom even for 20, 30, 80 or 90 years the Courts have held that a presumption may arise that the custom is ancient and that if the presumption is not rebutted the Court may accept it as a valid and ancient custom. 1892 Many instances have generally to be adduced for proof of a custom.

custom. 1893 In certain cases it has been held that specifio instances are not absolutely necessary, but the opinions of persons likely to know the existence of the custom is entitled to great weight, even though they may not be able to cite specific instances. 1893a Customs once prevalant, particularly family customs, may come to be dis continued on account of accident, change in popular sentiment or by the concurrent will of all the members concerned. 1894 Customs must be strictly construed and cannot be extended by analogy or parity of reasoning. Because in a particular caste marriage with a maternal uncle's daughter is allowed by custom 

it does not follow that marriage with a maternal aunt's or paternal aunt's daughter will necessarily be valid. Vide H. of Dh. vol. II. p. 467 notes 1095-6. The evidence about a custom should be such as to prove the uniformity and continuity of the usage, the conviction of those following it that they were acting in accordance with law and the consciousness of obligatorines and the custom should not spring from mere habit, imitation and ignorance or mutual arrangement. 1895 A custom must not be unreasonable. A custom of excluding daughters from inheritance was held to be not unreasonable according to the ideas of the Hindu community. 1896 A custom that only members of certain castes (and not of others) were entitled to make use of a temple and to worship therein was held not unreasonable in India, though it may appear obnoxious to cultured people at the present day. 1897 

Oustoms must not be immoral. Whether a custom is immoral is to be judged by the sense of the whole community 1998.

A custom which authorizes & woman of the lower castes to contract a second marriage without divorce on payment of a certain sum to the caste was held to be immoral 1899 and the Bombay High Court refused to recognize the authority of the caste to declare a marriage void or to give a woman permission to remarry without a release from the husband. 1900 The adop tion of girls by dancing girls ( naikins ) has not been recognized by the Bombay High Court, 1901 though the Madras High Court would recognize such an adoption if there was no intention to make it for purposes of prostitution. 1902 Dagger marriages are practised among certain castes. The Brahmapurāṇa (chap. 111. 15 and 44-46 ) states that among kṣatriyas there are several forms of marriage such as forcibly carrying away the bride (which is the form called rākṣasa ) or marriage with the weap ons (of the bridegroom). In modern times dagger or sword marriages have not been held valid by the courts even among gūdras; vide Maharaja of Kolhapur v. Sundaram 48 Mad. 1, Ram Saran v. Mahabir 61 I. A, 106. 

Many customs and usages have been expressly forbidden by the Central Indian or Provincial Legislatures e. g. Sati 1903, female infanticide, 1904 slavery, 1905 marriages of children under a certain age, 1906 the dedication of women as devadāsis to tem ples or idols. 1907 This being so, no court will allow a party to plead a custom against these positive enactments. It was recognised in a number of cases that in the Bombay Presi dency 1908 a vatandar joshi had the right to recover by suit from

a yajaman who had employed another priest to perform reli gious ceremonies the amount of the fees which would properly be payable to the vatandar joshi if he had been employed to perform such ceremonies and also the right to recover damages from a person who intrudes upon his office. But Bombay Act XI of 1926 (the Invalidation of Hindu Ceremonial Emoluments Act) now enacts ( by sec, 4 ) that no person shall be entitled to claim as a matter of right any ceremonial emoluments from any Hindu who does not call in the services of the person claiming those emoluments. Therefore, su its of the nature described above cannot be brought now in Bombay by a vatandar joshi. 

How customs and practices once prevalent may come to be discontinued or abrogated is well illustrated in the section on Kalivarjyas. Soine of those that have a legal bearing have been already discussed above.
