RĀJADHARMA 

( GOVERNMENT AND STATECRAFT) 

CHAPTER I 

Rajadharma has been a subject of discussion in works on dharmasastra from very ancient times. The Āp. Dh. S. II. 9.25.1 says "The general and special dharnus of all varnas have been explained: but now we shall declare the dharmas of a king in particular! Āp. then states that the king should cause to be built a capital and a palace, the gates of which both should face the south; that the palace should be in the heart of the capital; that in front of the capital there was to be a hall called 'aman trana' (hall of invitation); that to the south of the town there was to be an assembly house with doors on the north and south. Āp. requires that in the king's realm no brāhmaṇa should suffer hunger, sickness, cold or heat; Ap. gives regulations about the assembly house and about persons who were to be allowed to engage in gambling; he prescribes that the exercise in) arms, dancing, singing and music should not go on anywhere except in the houses of the king's servants, that the king was to see that there was no danger from thieves in villages and forests, that the king should donate fields and money to brāhmaṇas according to their worth without detriment to his servants, that the king who meets death in recovering the property of brāh mapas and other warlike persons who meet death in fighting for a similar worthy cause reap the merit of a sacrifice (i, e, reach heaven as reward); that the king should appoint in towns and Villages officers and their subordinates, who are pure and truth ful, for the protection of the subjects against thieves and who are to be made to make good what is stolen; that they are to collect lawful taxes for the king from the people except from learned brāhmaṇas, women of all castes, minors, students stay. ing with teachers and ascetics fulfilling the rules of their order, sūdras who do menial work for the higher castes (such as washing their feet), persons that are blind, deaf or dumb. Ap. then lays down punishments for adultery and rape, for slander and defamation, for manslaughter, for theft and appropriation of another's land, for breach of contract to cultivate the field of another, for a herdeman leaving his herd or negligently allowingHistory of Dharmasāstra

it to perish. He states that if the king does not punish the guilty he incurs sin, that in disputes judges should be men of learning, clever and fulfilling their duties, that witnesses were to tell the truth and were to be punished if they be untruthful. It will be noticed how Ap. briefly covers the whole field of rājam dharma. In the Sāntiparva of the Mahābhārata rājadharma is dealt with at great length in chapters 56-130 and to some extent in 131-17%. The Manusmrti also states at the beginning of chap. VII (1) that it will expound rājadharmas. That great literary activity on the science and art of government went on for many centuries before the Christian era follows from several considerations. The Anuśāsanaparva (chap. 39.8) speaks of the śāstras composed by Bphaspati and Usanas. The Santi parva (58.1-3) names as expounders of rājaśūstra Bphaspati, Bharadvāja, Gauraśiras, Kavya, Mahendra, Manu Pracetasa and Visalākṣa. Sāntiparva (102.31-32 ) opposes the view of Sambara to that of acāryas'. The Arthaśāstra of Kautilya mentions five schools (viz. those of the Mānavas, the Bārhaspatyas, the Ausa nasas, the Pārāsaras and the Ambhiyas), seven individual tea chers (V. 5, and I. 8) only once (viz. Bāhudantiputra, Dirgha Cārāyaṇa, Ghotamukha, Kaṇinka Bhāradvāja, Kātyāyana, Kin jalka, Pigunaputra,) and several times mentions the views of Bhāradvāja, Kauṇapadanta, Parāśara, Pisuna, Vātavyādhi, Viśālākṣa. Kautilya also cites at least 53 times the views of acāryas, almost in every case for dissent. Sānti 103.44 refers to a Bhāsya on rājasāstra. Is it possible to see in this a reference to one out of the bhāsyakāras indicated in the verse appended at the end of the Kautiliya or to the Kauṭiliya itself? Another fact indicative of the systematiza tion of the science of government is that in the Mahābhārata, the Rāmāyaṇa, Manu and Kautilya ideas expressed by numbers had already been stereotyped long before those works were written viz. such as saptāóga rājya (State with seven constituent elements ), ṣadguṇya (the six ways of policy viz. alliance, declaration of war &c.), three śaktis, the four upayas (sāma, dana, bheda, danda), astavarga, and pañcavarga (Manu VII. 155), the 18 and 15 tirthas (Sabhāparva 5.38).

Rajadharma 

about the Rājaśāstras of Bșhaspati, Uśanas, Bhāradvāja culled from the Mahabharata and other ancient works vide my paper on them in the Journal of the University of Bombay, vol. XI part 2 pp. 73-83, 1942. 

The fulfilment of their duties and responsibilities by rulers was of paramount importance to the stability and orderly develop ment of society and to the happiness of individuals in the State and therefore one often finds that rājadharma is said to be the root of or the quintessence of all dharmas. Santiparva (63.25) states * know that all dharmas are merged in rājadharma; that rajadharmas are at the head of all dharmas' and (141.9-10) * the welfare, good rains, sickness, calamities and death among people owe their origin to the king. It was the king's duty to see that the people in his kingdom acted according to the rules laid down in the smrtis for the several varnas and āsramas, to administer justice and to interfere when his help was sought for by a pariṣad ( assembly of learned men) in enforcing the prāyaścitla (penance ) prescribed for various lapses. Vide Gautama x. 7-8, XI. 9-11, Ap. Dh. S. II. 5. 10. 13-16', Vasistha 19. 1-2, Vispu III. 2-3, Narada (prakirnaka, 5-7 and 33-34), Santiparva 77.33 and 57.15, Matsyapurana 215.63, Markandeya purāṇa 27.28 and 28.36 and H. Dh. vol. II. p. 965. Therefore it may be said with truth (as done by the Mahābhārata) that rājadharma was the highest goal of all the world, that it com prehended within itself all rules of ācāra, vyavahāra ( admini stration of justice) and prayascitta (penance). It is on account of this all-pervading influence of government or royal power that the Mahābhārata frequently emphasizes that the king is the maker of his age, that it is he who can usher a golden age or an age of strife and misery for the country'. The Sukranitisara (I.

[Vol. 

59-60 ) remarks that one should learn from sastra what are good and evil actions, give up evil deeds and perform good ones and that the king is hence declared to be the cause of (good or evil) times according as he does good or evil acts. Sukra IV.1, 60 states that the king is the prompter of his age. 

Though rājadharma was thus an integral part of dharma śāstra and was one of the most important subjects therein, yet apart from the works on dharmaśāstra separate treatises dealing with rājadharma alone came into existence in very early times. Santiparva (chap. 59 ) states that originally in the Krta age there was no king nor punishment, that then moha ( delusion), greed and lust entered men, that in order to provide against the complete destruction of dharma, Brahmā composed a work in one hundred thousand chapters on dharma, artha, kānia and mokṣa (verses 30 and 79); that part of this work on Niti (science of government) was abridged by Saṅkara Vitālākṣa (verse 80, and so it was called Vaigalaksa) into 10000 chapters, that Indra studied it and reduced it to 5000 chapters (and the work was called Bahudantaka, verse 83), that it was compressed into 3000 chapters by Bșhaspati (and so was called Bārhaspatya) and that Kāvya (Uśanas) reduced the work to 1000 chapters. The Kāmasūtra (I. 5-8) contains a somewhat similar story that Prajāpati composed a work in one hundred thousand chapters, that Manu abridged it as regards dharma, Bṛhaspati as regards artha and Nandi abridged in 1000 chapters the science of erotics. The Sāntiparva (69) gives (verses 33-74) & summary of the contents of the work of Brahmā on rājadharma which remarkab ly agrees with the principal topics of the Kauṭiliya. 

The Nitiprakāśikā (I. 21-22 ) states that Brahma, Maheśvara, Skanda, Indra, Prācetasa Manu, Brhaspati, Sukra, Bhāradvāja, Veda-Vyāsa, Gaurasirag were the expounders of Rājaśāstra, that Brahma composed a work on rājaśāstra in 100000 chapters, which was gradually reduced in size by each of the above mentioned founders until Gaurasiras reduced it to 500 chapters and Vyāsa to 300. The Sukranitisāra (I. 2-4) states that Brahma composed nitiśāstra in 100000 verses, which was subsequently abridged by Vasiṣtha and others (including Sukra). 

It is interesting to note the names given to the science of government. The most appropriate word is rājaśāstra' and it is employed by the Mahabharata, which speaks of Bphaspati, Bharadvāja and others as 'rājaśāstra-pranetāraḥ' (vide p.% above). The Nitiprakaśika (I. 21-22) also dubs the divine and human

writers on government 'rājaśāstrāṇām. pranetāraḥ.' The same word is employed by such ancient classical writers as Aśvaghoṣa in his Buddhacarita (I. 46). The first verse in Prof. Edgerton's reconstructed Pañcatantra performs obeisance to Manu, Bṛhas pati, Sukra, Parāśara and his son and Canakya as the authors of nṛpaśāstra (science of kingship). Another name is Dandaniti. The Sāntiparva (59.78) explains why Dandaniti is so called viz. this world is led (on to the right path) by danda (the power of punishment, sanction) or this science carries (or sets forth) the rod of punishment; hence it is called dandaniti and it (faces) pervades the three worlds.' In śāntiparva 69.76 it is stated that 'Dandaniti controls the four varnas so as to lead them on to the performance of their duties and when it is employed by the ruler properly, it makes them desist from adharma.'? Santi 63. 28 identifies Dandaniti with rajadharmas. The Kauṭiliya (I. 4) explains 'Dagda is the means of the stability and welfare of Anviksiki, Trayı (the three Vedas) and Vārtā; the rules that treat of danda are called dapdaniti, which is a means of acquiring what has not been acquired, which safeguards what is acquired, which increases what is guarded and distributes (increased wealth) among the deserv ing. The Mahābhārata says (Santi 69. 102 ) that a wise ksatriya, putting dandaniti in front, should always desire to acquire what is till then unacquired and should guard what is acquired. The Nitisāra (II. 15) says that dama (control or chastisement) is called danda, the king is called 'danda' because control is centered in him; that the niti (rules) of danda is called danda niti and niti is so called because it leads (people).'"* Sānti(69. 104) says that dandaniti is the special concern of the ksatriya (rājan). It is said in the Vanaparva 150. 32 that without Dapdaniti this

whole world would break all bounds. Vide also Śānti 15,29, 63.28, 69.74 ff (eulogy of Dandaniti). Dandaniti is said to be the support of the world (Sānti 121.24) and to have been produced by Devi Sarasvati (Santi 122.25.) 

Arthaśāstra has been a synonym for dapdaniti. When the Āp. Dh. S. II. 5.10.16 requires the king to appoint as purohita a brāhmaṇa well-versed in dharma and artha, it is clear that Apastamba has in view dharmaśāstra and arthaśāstra. The Anuśāsanaparva says that Bphaspati and others composed artha sāstras (39.10-11). Dronaparva 6,1 speaks of a science of artha composed by Manu (Mānavī arthavidyā). Vide Jayagwal in 

Manu and Yājñavalkya' (pp. 5, 7, 16, 25, 26, 41, 42, 50, 84, for Manu and Artha). Sānti (71.14) states that a king whose sole concern is with arthaśāstra does not secure dharma and kāma and that all the wealth of such a king vanishes in ( the pursuit of ) improper objects. Vide Sānti 30%. 109 which speaks of artha sāstra as resorted to by the best among kings. The Rāmāyana (II. 100.14) states that Sudhanvā, Upādhyāya of Rāma, was an adept in arthaśāstra. The arthasāstra of Kautilya starts with the statement that it is the quintessence of all the arthagāstras composed by former teachers in the whole world and at the end Kautilya states that that sāstra which is a means of acquiring and guarding the earth is arthaśāstra. This mentions two of the four objects of dandaniti stated in the Kauṭiliya itself (as shown in n.8 above). Only two objects are mentioned by Kautilya (as in Santi 69. 102 ) since they are the first and principal ones to be gained by the practice of the science of government. It is not meant that there was, as regards the topics to be dealt with, any diṣtinction between Dandaniti and Arthagāstra. The four objects mentioned by Kautilya are always placed before the kṣatriya by Manu (VII. 99-100), śānti 102. 57 and 140.5, Yaj. I. 317, Nitisāra I. 18 ( while I. 8 mentions only two purposes of rājavidya). At the end (XV. 1) Kautilya states' artha is the sustenance of human beings, that is, the earth peopled by men That gāstra which is a means of acquiring and guarding that earth is arthasāstra.' Men derive their sustenance from the earth and all wealth also arises from the earth. Mr. Jayaswal ( Hindu Polity p. 5) is not right when he translates' Artha is human population.' Vide V. Ghoshal's 'Hindu Political Theories' p. 74 n and p. 76 for the various interpretations of this passage by Jayaswal and others. Authors a few centuries later than both the Mahabharata and the Kauṭiliya treat the two as 

holds that the others. The Mitakse

identical. Daṇdin in his Dasakumaracarita (VIII.) expressly says that Viṣnugupta composed his work on dandaniti for the Maurya king in 6000 ślokas, though the Kautillya states at the very beginning that the work is an arthaśāstra. Dandin in the same context refers to 'Arthaśāstras as helping to polish the intellect' and speaks of some of the predecessors mentioned by Kautilya as writers on the śāstra (viz. the Arthaśāstra )." The Amarakośa treats the two as identical, 12 Medhatithi on Manu VII. 43 holds that the word 'Dandaniti' therein refers to the works of Canakya and others. The Mitāksarā or. Yāj. I. 313 paraphrases dandaniti by arthasāstra and on Yaj. I. 311 explains dandanīti as the lore useful in the acquisition and guarding of wealth (only the two objects mentioned by Kautilya in connec tion with arthasāstra ). According to the Sukranitisāra (IV. 3.56 ) 

that is said to be arthaśāstra in which instruction about the conduct of kings and the like is given without coming in. conflict with Sruti and Smṛti and in which the acquisition of wealth with great skill is taught'. 

The words arthaśāstra and dandaniti are applied to the science of government from two different points of view. Artha is defined in the Kāmasutra (I. 20) as 'education, lands, gold, cattle, corn, domestic utensils and friends and the augmenting of what is acquired' (vide H. Dh. Vol. II part I. p. 9 note 22). Therefore when wealth and prosperity of all kinds is the spring and motive of giving a name the science treating of these is called arthaśāstra and when the government of the people and the punishment of offenders are the main ideas the same is called dapdaniti. Though works like Kautilya's Arthaśāstra place a high value on dharma they are principally concerned with the treatment of central and local government, taxation, the employment of sama and other upāyas, with alliances and wars, appointment of officers and punishment. Therefore Artha gāstra is mainly what is called drṣtartha smrti, as stated by the Bhavisyapurāṇa (quoted by Aparārka p. 626, the Smṛticandrikā p. 24, vyavahāra and Viramitrodaya, paribhāṣā p. 19). Medha tithi on Manu VII. 1 explains that dharma in that verse means

* duties' (dharmaśabdaḥ kartavyatāvacanaḥ), that the duties of the king are either drstārtha (i. e. the effects of which are worldly and visible) such as the employment of six gunas (sandhi, vigraha &c.) or adrstārtha (that have no visible effect but have a spiritual result) such as Agnihotra; here (in chap. VII-IX of Manu) the remarks relate principally to drstārtha matters since it is well-known that the word rājadharma is appli cable to such matters (the six guṇas &c.) only.13 Medhatithi here declares that the rules of rājaniti are not based on the canonical books of dharmaśāstra but principally on the ex perience of worldly affairs. 

Another name for the science of government is Nitiśāstra or Rajanitisāstra. Sānti" 59.74 says that in the nitiśāstra are set forth all those means whereby people are prevented from forsaking the right path. The Nitisara of Kamandaka's (I. 6) does obeisance to Viṣnugupta who extracted the nectar of Niti gāstra from the vast ocean of Arthasāstra (works). The Pañca tantra p. 2 holds that Arthaśāstra and Nitiśāstra are synony mous. The Mitākṣarā on Yāj. II. 21 remarks that the arthaśāstra referred to by Yāj. is rājanitiśāstra that is part and parcel of dharmasastra. The word 'rājaniti' occurs in Raghuvamsa 17.68. Vide Bhagavadgita X. 38, Aśramayāsikaparva 6.5, Manu VII. 177, Sānti 111, 73, 138,39, 43 and 196, 268,9 and Anusāsana 163.7 for Nitiśāstra meaning Arthaśāstra or Rājaniti and Drona 152,29 and Santi 37.9 for the word rājaniti. Another noteworthy word is 'naya' which means 'line of policy' and is employed by the Arthaśāstra (1.2) when it says'naya and anaya (bad policy) are treated of in Dandaniti'. It is also used in several classical works, such as the Kirātārjuniya (II. 3, 12, 54, XIII. 17). 

The relation of arthagāstra to dharmaśāstra has now to be understood. As stated above rājadharma is a very important subject of dharma-śāstra. Arthasāstra which is principally concerned with the rights, privileges and res ponsibilities of the ruler is therefore properly speaking a part of dharmaśāstra. As shown above it is supposed to have

like dharmaśāstra a divine source. But works on arthasāstra enter into great details about the government of a country in all its aspects, while dharmaśāstra works generally deal only with a few salient features of rājaśāstra. Just as the Kamasutra (I. 2. 14 ) states that dharma is the highest goal and kāma is the lowest of the three puruṣārthas (vide H. Dh. vol. II part 1 p. 9), so Arthaśāstra also sets the highest value on dharma. The Kauṭiliya states (III. 1. at end) 'In any matter where there is a conflict between dharmaśāstra and practices or between dharmaśāstra and any secular transaction, (the king ) should decide that matter by relying on dharma. If śāstra comes in conflict with any rational and equitable rule then the latter shall be the deciding factor and the (strict ) letter of the text will be nowhere'. But Kautilya and other writers on artha Bāstra lay the greatest emphasis on artha. In the eager and relentless pursuit of worldly prosperity means may be recommended or followed which may come in confict with the strictly ethical standpoint of the dictates of dharmaśāstra. In such cases of conflict dharmaśāstra works lay down (e. g. Ap. Dh. 1.9. 24. 23, Yaj. II. 21, Nārada, vyavahāramātrkā, chap. I 39 ) that dharmaśāstra rules are to be preferred to the dictates of arthasāstra. Visvarūpa (on Yāj. II. 21 ) states that according to some predecessors of his the conflict between the dictates of dharmaśāstra and arthaśāstra is illustrated as follows. Manu VII. 351 (which is the same as Viṣnu-dharmasūtra V. 190 and Matsyapurāṇa 227. 116-117 ) when dealing with vyavahāra ( a subject that pre-eminently belongs to arthaśāstra ) provides that in killing an ātalāyin, no fault attaches to the killer: while Manu XI. 89 in the chapter on prayascittas (which is pre eminently a topic of dharmaśāstra ) states that no penance is prescribed (i. e. there is no prāyaścitta for removing the guilt) when a person of set purpose kills a brāhmaṇa. The result is that the latter rule prevails and sin is incurred by killing a brāhmaṇa even if the latter be an atatāyin ( though there may be no punishment by the king ). Visvarūpa does not accept

this illustration. The Mitakṣarā also refers to this example, disapproves of it and gives its own example. The Arthasāstra declares that a king should endeavour to secure friends, since the acquisition of friends is superior to the acquisition of gold and land ( as is laid down in Yāj. I. 352). The rule of dharma Gāstra is that a king has to dispense justice, being free from anger and avarice and in accordance with dharmaśāstra. There fore when a suit comes before a king he must decide it according to law, even though he may lose the friendship of a person if his decision goes against the latter. The Viramitrodaya follows the Mitākṣarā. Dharmaśāstra went by the name of smrti (Manu II. 10), while arthasāstra was treated as an Upaveda. The Viṣnupurāṇa III. 6. 28, Vāyu 61.79 and Brahmānda 35. 88-89 mention the four Upavedas 1 viz. Ayurveda, Dhanurveda, Gandharvaveda and Arthasāstra as afiliated to the four Vedas respectively viz. Rgveda, Yajurveda, Sāmaveda and Atharvaveda. Kautilya (15) states that the king should listen to the recital of itihāsu in the latter part of the day and includes both dharmasastra and arthaśāstra under itibāsa' and requires the minister know ing arthaśāstra to advise the king (with examples and precepts derived) from itihāsa and purāṇa. . Though Arthaśāstra is in theory for keeping to the path of dharma, one cannot blink one's eyes to the fact that the Maha bhārata and the Kauṭiliya both support in several places the adoption of means entirely divorced from all rules of fair deal ing and morality. In Adiparva 140 we have a discourse by Kaṇika said to have been a mantrin of Dhrtarāstra and a pro found student of Rājaśāstra, which is almost on the same lines as Santiparva chap. 140 where Bhiṣma sets out what lines of policy (niti ) should be followed by the ruler in adversity and how he should give up all thoughts of kindliness in such straits. He is supposed to give the substance of the dialogue between the sage Bhāradvāja and Satruntapa, king of Sauvira. The whole chapter is full of Machiavellian advice. A few speci mens may be set out here. One should be very courteous in speech, but like a razor at heart ( verse 13); one desirous of prosperity may fold one's hands, may take an oath, may use

sweet words, place his head on another's feet and even shed tears, one may carry on one's shoulders one's enemy till one accomplishes one's object and when a fit opportunity arises should break him like an earthen pot on a stone (17-18); the king should raise hopes promising their fulfilment at a distant day, but should put obstacles in the fulfilment of the hopes raised in others (32); when one is reduced to a wretched state one may extricate oneself from it by any act whatever whether gentle or horrible and practise dharma after one becomes able to do so (38); one should inspire confidence in one's enemy by some means which appear to be true ( to the enemy ), but one should strike him down at the right moment when he takes a wrong step (44); whoever causes obstacles to the purpose of the king, whether son or brother or father or friend, should be killed by the king who desires to prosper (47); without cutting the vitals of others, without committing horrible deeds and without killing indiscriminately as the fisherman in the case of fish one does not secure high prosperity (50); when about to strike one should utter sweet words and even after striking one should use honoyed words; even after severing another's head with a sword one should lament and shed tears (54); if some remainder is left in the case of a debt or fire or enemies, there is a tendency to grow and so no remainder should be left of these (58). It is to be noted that this chapter deals specially with what should be done in difficulties and can not be supposed to be the real teaching of the Mahābhārata which is generally in line with the higher code of dharma sastra. It embodied probably the words of earlier arthaśāstra writers like Bhāradvāja. After hearing this discourse on calculated cruelty and deceit Yudhisthira 'stood aghast and frankly told Bhisma that the course of conduct outlined by him did not differ from that of robbers and that he felt bewildered and would not exert himself in the way pointed out. In chap. 142 Bhisma replies to this by saying that he did not base his dis course merely on the sacred texts, but also on reason and the essence was distilled by wise men, that the considered rule of conduct for the king is twofold, viz. straightforward and crooked, that one should not ordinarily employ the crooked course of conduct, but should employ it as against an enemy who employs a crooked policy and effectively meet him by such policy. He further says that rājadharma cannot be based on a single source (v.7) and that policies are to be pursued not merely by reliance on the sacred codes of law but on reason as well12

[Vol. 

(v. 17 ) and that Indra himself has declared this rule which he derived from Bphaspati. In Sānti-parva a weak king is advised to harass a very powerful ruler's state by sword, fire and poison. In chap. 130 it is stated that the preservation of the state is the paramount consideration and that a king whose treasury is depleted and who is therefore in diffi culties may replenish his treasury even by harassing his subjects (except tāpasas and learned brāhmaṇas). In chap. 138 it is said that self-interest makes friends or foes and that aviśvāsa (putting trust in no one ) is the grand line of policy for kings. So it is clear that the Mahābhārata was prepared to give up in certain circumstances the strict rules of dharmaśāstra for kings and to allow them to pursue devious modes of action that were far from moral i. e. it tries to effect a synthesis of dharmaśāstra and arthaśāstra. 

The Kautillya also discloses how arthaśāstra writers did not shrink from giving advice which, to say the least, was most cruel, selfish and immoral. For example, in the section called ' guarding the prince'( Kauṭ. I. 17 ) the views of several teachers are set out. Bhāradvāja says that princes are of the nature of crabs eating up their parent; so it is better to finish them in secret when they have no love for their father. Viśālākṣa abhorred this advice as cruel, as unsanctioned murder and as destructive of the seed of ksatriyas and recommended that it was better to keep them confined in a single spot. Vātavyādhi recommended that princes should be made addicted to sensual excesses. Kaut, disapproves of this as living death ( for the princes ), recommends proper care before conception and after birth and instruction in dharma. In Kaut V. 6 Bhāradvāja is quoted as saying that when the king is on his death-bed, the minister may set up the kinsmen of the king and the principal princes against one another, that whoever attacks should be killed by inciting the people against him, or having secretly punished the kinsmen and chief princes and brought them under control, the minister should himself take possession of the kingdom. Kautilya does not approve of this. But even he advises (XIV Aupaniṣadika ) the employment of poison, herbs and incantations against those who are irreligious or wicked. In I. 18 even Kaut, does not shrink from advising that secret emissaries ( of the reigning king ) may kill an abandoned prince with weapons and poison and in V, 1 Kaut. remarks that, when ā king cannot openly put down the principal courtiers or chiefs

who are dangerous to the kingdom, he may inflict punishment on them in secret or may induce the brother of the officer to be punished to attack the latter by promising to give him the posit ion and wealth of the officer and then destroy that attacker with weapons or poison saying that he was guilty of fratricide. In V.2 for replenishing a depleted treasury Kautilya coolly asks the king to deprive the temples in the kingdom of their wealth through the superintendent of religious endowments. 

Sanskrit literature on rājadharma is very extensive. Apart from the meagre materials contained in such ancient dharma sūtras as that of Āpastamba, the following works deserve close study and have been utilized in this section; the Mahābhārata (Vanaparva 150, Sabhā 5, Udyoga 33-34, Sānti 1-130, Āśrama vāsika 5-7), the Rāmāyana (Ayodhyā, chap. 15, 67, 100; Yuddha 17-18, 63), Manusmrti VII-IX, Arthaśāstra of Kautilya ( which is the leading work on rājadharma), Yāj.

Thomas), the Rājanitikāṇda of the Krtyakalpataru of Lakṣmidhara ( edited from a single ms. by Jagadish Lal Shastri at Lahore, 1942 ), Rājaniti-ratnākara of Capdeśvara, Rājaniti prakasa of Mitramiśra, Nitimayūkha of Nilakantha, Rāja. dharmakaustubha of Anantadeva, Budhabhūṣana of Prince Sambhāji (between A. D. 1675-1680, ed. by Prof. H.D. Velankar), Dandaniti of Keśavapaṇdita (edited by V. S. Bendrey, Poona, 1943). In recent times there is a deluge of works mostly inspired by the publication of the Kauṭiliya dealing with ancient and medieval Indian polity in its various branches. The most important of these and a few other works independent of Kautilya are mentioned in the note below. 18 

19. Some parts of the Santiparva may be later than Kāmandaka's work, since santi ( 123. 11-12) refers to the dialogue of Kāmandaka and Angaristba king of Anga. But it need hardly be said that it is not absolutely necessary to hold that the extant Nitisāra of Kamandaka is referred to by sāntiparva.

In my treatment of rājadharma I have generally restricted myself to data derived from Sanskrit works on dharmaśāstra and arthasastra and have rarely ventured into works in Pāli. Similarly it has to be borne in mind that the works referred to cover a period of several centuries and further that In dia is not one country but a continent of wbich northern India formed one more or less homogeneous unit, while the Deccan formed another and South India formed a third unit. The institutions of these, particularly of the last of the three differ in many particolars from those of the other two. But the authentic data furnished by South India aro later by centuries than thoso supplied by the north and besides are comparatively meagre. Therefore in this work one has to confine oneself principally to Sanskrit works composed in North India or the Deccan.

proposed is to indicate and dilate upon only the fundamental ideas and principles of the several matters falling under rāja dharma. Nor is it possible to enter here into formal and lengthy refutations of the several views propounded by Western and Indian writers about the forms and functions of Government and the state of society in ancient India. Most of the modern works referred to in note 19 above are more or less based on the same material in Sanskrit and Pāli, but the emotional or subjec tive element is different in each case. Some western writers have without very solid foundations iudulged in a facile and sweeping generalization that the great Empires of antiquity such as those of the Assyrians, the Babylonians, the Medians and Persians and the Indians were mainly tax-gathering insti tutions (vide Sir Henry Maine's 'Early History of Institutions' 1875, pp. 384 and 390; and Prof. Rangaswami Aiyangar's 'Ancient Indian Polity' 1935, pp. 5-6 and pp. 66-69 (where passages from T. H. Green and others are cited); while some Indian writers vehemently assert that the Government in An cient India was always some form of limited monarchy. Both characterisations are in my opinion misleading. An endeavour will be made to present from the original texts as true a picture of the polity of ancient and medieval India as it is possible for me to do. It will do no good to label the ancient institutions of India with concepts and terms current in the West during the last one hundred and fifty years or so. Even in the West true democra cies or real democratic governments did not exist and the masses in no country had elective popular assemblies or councils before the last quarter of the 18th century. Such assemblies do not exist even now in several countries of Europe. Even in the ancient Greek city states the number of slaves who had no voice in the government was several times as large as the free citizens and those states were no democracies at all in the strict sense. 198 Indian polity has a recorded history of over two thousand years from at least the 4th century B. C. Its growth was gradual but its aims and ideals and its main elements have been the same throughout the centuries. India need not feel ashamed or fear

Berolzheimer in 'the World's Legal Philosophies' (tr. by Jastrow, New York, 1929) p. 62 remarks ‘Plato approved of slavery unreservedly, finding it & necessary condition for the maintenance of the proper status of the citizen.... Thus in the maritime and industrial states there was a large slave class; in Corinth, 460000; Aegina, 470000; la Attica (according to the consus of 309 B, C.) 400000',

a comparison of its ideals and theories of State with the ideals and theories of western countries in ancient and medieval times. If western countries could boast of so-called republics and city states in ancient Greece and Rome, India also had several re publics in ancient times. The ancient Hindus made their own contributions to political thought, though unfortunately Western scholars of the 19th century like Max Müller, Weber and Roth were concerned most with the Vedic and allied literature and either did not know or ignored the vast literature on politics contained in Sanskrit and Pali works. Vide 'Some Aspects of ancient Hindu Polity' by Prof. D. R. Bhandarkar (1929) pp. 2-3 for views of Max Müller and others and criticism thereof, also Dr. Beni Prasad's “Theory of Government &c.' P.

## 02 Seven Aṅgas of Rājya

CHAPTER II. 

SEVEN ANGAS OF RAJYA 

According to almost all of our authorities a state (rūjya) is constituted by seven elements 20 viz. svāmin (ruler or sovereign), amūtya (minister), janapada or rāṣtra (the territory of the State and its people), durga ( fortified city or capital), kośa ( accumula ted wealth in the ruler's treasury), dandu (army), mitra (friends or allies). These seven are called angas or praktis. The word praksti in works on politics is also used for the constituents of a circle of states (of a mandala). Vide Manu VII. 156 and Kau tilya (VI.2). The word also means ministers as in Sukranitisāra II. 70-73 and 'subjects' in Khāravela's Inscription (E. I. vol. 20 p.79 1. 4), Nārada (prakīrṇaka 5), Raghuvamsa VIII. 18. The order in which these are arranged and their names vary a good deal. The quotations given below will indicate how the order differs. The sequence is important for the reason that some of our authorities expressly state that when calamities be fall or deterioration sets in each of the seven elements, those that befall each preceding one are more serious for the State than those of each succeeding one ( Kautilya VIII. 1, Manu IX. 295). For janapada sometimes the word jana or rāṣtra is used, for * danda' the word 'bala' and the word 'pura' for 'durga'. The Aśramavāsiparva (5.8) speaks of eight angas of rājya. Accord ing to Sumantu quoted by the Sarasvativilāsa (p. 46 ) danda means “punishment bodily or monetary” and' army is included under ‘kośa'. Sumantu says that th esvūmin has to be preserved by himself, the ministers by showing them proper respect, the people by keeping them contented, the fortified capital by abun dance of wealth and grain, the kośa by proper expenditure, danda

History of Dharmafāstra 

(Vol. by following one's dharma, friends by truthfulness. The autho rities are agreed that the ruler is the most important or the first of the seven. Kautilya puts the matter very forcibly and realis. tically when he states that the briefest exposition of the elements of rājya is to say that the king is the State S). This is really not the same doctrine as that emphasized by Louis XIV of France when he said ' L'Etat c'est moi'. Kautilya makes his position clear (in VIII, 1) by saying that it is the king who appoints ministers and servants and superintendents, who takes measures of relief against calamities befalling the other prakstis and measures of prosperity, that it is he who appoints other ministers when those already appointed are under calamities, that if the ruler is pros perous he transmits prosperity to his prakstis, that the prakstis bear that character which the king has and that hence the ruler occupies the position of a permanent, never-exhausted centre of power. The Sukranitisāra II4 remarks that if the king begins to act at his sweet will, it leads to calamities, to loss of ministers and of the kingdom. The Sukranitisāra (I. 61-62) compares the seven angās of rājya to the organs of the body viz., the king is the head, the ministers are the eyes, ally the ear, treasury the mouth, the army the mind, capital and rāṣtra are hands and feet. It is emphasized by Kām. (IV.1-2) that each of the seven elements is complementary to the others, that if the state is defective even in one out of the seven elements it does not pull well. thel Sāntiparva it is stated that it is not possible to say categorically that any one of the seven excels the others in merit, but that at different times a different element assumes importance over others, since that particular element is in the particular circumstances capable of accomplishing the purpose in hand. This shows that Manu and the Mahābhārata held that there was an organic unity in the several elements of rājya. All must work harmoniously towards one ideal or end. Manu (IX. 296–297) says this by means of a simile 'Just as among the three staves tied together (by a rope of cow's hair) used by a sannyāsin no particular staff is superior (to the others ), so among

the seven elements of the state no particular one can be said to excel the others, since each of them has a particular excellence of its own; a particular element is pre-eminent in some particular matter and therefore the superiority of one to the others when expressed (as e. g. in Manu IX. 295 ) is to be confinod to that matter alone.' Manu here emphasizes the harmonious working or unity of the seven elements though they are diverse in their individual characters. The analysis of the elements and nature of the State led ancient Indian writers to hold that a mere conglomeration of people did not by itself constitute a State, but that for a State there must be people who live within certain definite geographical limits (rāstra ), they must be bound by the bond to render allegiance to a ruler ( svāmi), have a certain system of government (amātya), inust have a regulated economic system, a force for defence and international relationships. That is, the most essential elements of a state are (1) a sovereign, (2) a system of govern ment, (3) a definite territory and (4) & population of some size. These four were known even to the most ancient sūtras. Vide Gaut. XI. 1 (rāja), Ap. II. 6. 25. 10 (amātya), Ap. II. 10. 25. 11, 

II, 10, 26. 4 (visaya, nagara, grāma), Gaut XI. 5-8 (prajā). 

These seven elements will now be dealt with one after another. 

It should be noted that neither Kautilya nor Kamandaka defines rājya. Etymologically it means the 'karma' or 'bhāva' ( activity or state of a king )', being derived from 'rājan' with the affix 'ya'(syan or' yak', acc. to Pāṇini V. 1. 124 and 128 ). This is the etymological meaning. But rājya ' is employed in the sense of 'kingdom' in popular parlance and also in the smrtis and works on polity as in Manu VII. 111, Kim, XIII. 81-82, But when it is said that rājya 'has seven elements then ' rājya 'has a very wide meaning and stands for the king, the ministers, the country and its people and the economic and military resources and in such a case it is proper to translate the word as 'the State'(as including both the Government and the governed). In some cases rājya' should be rendered as * government, which includes only the king and his ministers and conveys also in modern times the agency or machinery through which the will of the State is formulated, realized or carried out; vide Mānasollāsa II. 8, verses 688,689, 691 The Nitivākyāmsta (p: 43 ) says " rājya means the activity of the ruler that would be appropriate to protecting the earth". 

20 

History of Dharmasastra 

[Vol. 

Medhatithi on Manu VIII. 1 remarks that rājya means 'a prosperous people'. In XIII. 4 Kautilya states (na hyajano janapado rājyam janapadam vī bhavatili Kautilyah) it as his opinion that a territory without any inhabitants cannot become a rājya (a kingdom ) or a janapada (as one of the seven elemento). Sabara on Jai. II. 3. 3 has a discourse on the deri vation of rājya. 

Prof. Bhandarkar in 'Some Aspects of Ancient Indian Polity' (pp. 66-89), Jayaswal in Hindu Polity' part II p. 9, Prof. B. K. Sarkar in ‘Positive Background of Hindu Sociology' Book II pp. 34-39 and others maintain that this ancient analysis of rājya into seven elements shows that the idea of the State as an organism, that is, the organic theory of the State was known to Hindu thinkers and that this doctrine of saptanga rājya 1a satisfies the definition of the State given by Bluntschli and others. On the other hand Mr. Anjaria in chapter IV of his 'Nature and grounds of political obligation in the Hindu state' after pointing out how there are different versions of the organic theory of the state denies vehemently that the Hindu theory can be called a proper organic theory of the State, particularly because the Hindu thinkers did not regard the State as a moral organism, because they attached a permanent stigma of inferiority to large sections of the community on the bare ground of birth and that the Hindu conceptions did not harmonize the authority of the State and the liberty of the individual. It would be far beyond the scope of the present work to enter into any discussion of this problem. All that may be said is that Mr. Anjaria tilts the balance to the other side too much. The faults he points out in the Hindu theory and practice beset almost all theories of the State almost in all countries. Even in the times of Plato and Aristotle huge popula tions of slaves had no voice in the affairs of the state. Up to the 19th century true democracies never existed oven in Europe. 

The Ruler--The necessity of a ruler is forcibly emphasized in several works. The Ait. Br. I. 14 says that the gods thought they were worsted because they had no king, that therefore they elected one by consent. This shows that military necessities 

. 218. Korkunov in General Theory of Law' (tr. by W. G. Hastings, New York, 1922) says 'Bluntschli' assimilates government to the head, as it is the head of the State, the ministry of the ioterior to the ears, and that of foreign affairs to the pose' (p. 274). 

DI] 

Matsyanyaya led to kingship. Manu VII. 3 ( =śukranitisāra I. 71 ) says the Creator created the king for the protection of all this world when everything ran through fear bither and thither, as there was then no ruler in the world'. It goes on to say that the Creator proceeded to create Daṇda (the power of punishment ) for the sake of the king and that if the king does not sedulously employ danda for punishing those that deserve it, the strong would torment the weak as fish are fried on a pike or as in water fish devour each other (Manu VII. 14 and 20, the last also showing a variant 'jale' for 'śūle'). This idea of mātsyanyaya ( the maxim of the larger fish devouring the smaller ones or the strong despoiling the weak) is frequently dwelt upon by Kautilya, the Mahābhārata and other works. It can be traced back to the Satapatha-brāhmaṇa XI. 1. 6. 24. whenever there is drought, then the stronger seizes upon the weaker, for the waters are the law ', which appears to mean that when there is no rain, the reign of law comes to an end and mātsyanyāya begins to operate. Kautilya says “if danda be not employed, it gives rise to the condition of mūtsyanyāya, since in the absence of a chastiser the strong devour the weak' and 'the people overwhelmed by the operation of mātsyanyāya made Manu Vaivasvata their king.' 83 That in the absence of a king (urājaka ) or when there is no fear of punishment, the condi tion of mātsyanyāya follows is declared by several works such as the Rāmāyana II. chap. 67, Santiparva 15. 30 and 67. 16, Kāmandaka II. 40, Matsyapurāna 225.9, Mānasollāsa II. 20 verse 1295. Numerous works contain eulogies of daṇda. The king is called dandadhara in many works e.g, in Santiparva 67.16 and Kām. I. 1. Gautama XI. 28 says that the word danda is derived by the wise from the root' dam '(to control ), that he (the king ) should control by means of danda those who observe no restraint and (XI. 31 ) that the instructions of the teacher and the power of punishment(wielded by the king) guard those who violate the rules of varṇas and aśramas.

%25. 17, Agnipurāṇa 226. 16 and Sāntiparva 15.8 state that danda is so called because it suppresses those that are not restrained (from the root 'dam') and punishes those that are imprudent or ungentlemanlike ( from the root' dand '). Danda is raised to the position of a divinity by Manu 24 VII. 25 (= Visnudharma. sutra II. 95 = Matsya 225. 8), Yāj. I. 354, Santi 121. 15. Danda rules over all people, it protects all of them, danda is awake even when ( the guardians of law ) have gone to sleep, the wise regard danda as dharma ( Manu VII. 18=Sānti 15.2 = Matsya 225. 14-15). The whole world is under the heel of daṇda, for it is difficult to find a man who is pure by nature (Manu VII. 22 = Sānti 15. 34). The conception of danda is therefore this that the State's will and coercive power keep the indivi dual and nation within the bounds of dharma, punish for breaches and effect the good of the whole. The gods, dānavas, gandharvas, the rākṣasas and reptiles -- these also tend to bring about enjoyment for men because they are pressed down by danda (Manu VII. 23 ). The Bhagavadgitā (X. 38) identifies danda with the divine Kroṇa 'I am danda in the hands of those who control others, I am niti ( i. e. rājaniti ) for the conquerors'. For the detailed effects and long eulogies of danda, vide Manu VII. 14-31, Matsya 225. 4-17, Kāmandaka II: 38-44. These eulogies of danda presuppose the theory that people obey law and the dictates of the śāstra through the fear of force or punishment. Danda should be neither too severe nor too mild, but should be appropriate to the fault committed (Kaut. I. 4, Kāmandaka II, 37, Manu VII. 16, Santi 15. 1ff Santi 56. 21, 103. 34). Sānti 57. 41 advises that one should first secure a king, then wife and then wealth, for in the absence of the ruler there would be no wife nor private property. * This shows that the institutions of family and private property and the protection of the weak are bound up with the existence of a fuler. Kātyāyana (in Raja N. P. p. 30 ) says the king is the

protector of the helpless, the home of the homeless, the son of the sonless and the father of the fatherless. 

In order to magnify the importance of the kingly office, certain works state that the king has in him parts of the gods. For example, Manu says "the Creator created the king with the essential parts taken from Indra, the Wind god, Yama, the Sun, Agni, Varuna, the Moon and Kubera the lord of wealth and therefore he surpasses all beings by his majesty (VII. 4-5 and compare Manu V. 96 ); one should not disrespect a boy-king with the thought he is a human being ( like others )' for it is a great deity that stands ( before people) in human form as a king" (Manu VII. 8=Santi 68.40). This conception goes back to Gautama XI. 32 ( Therefore a king and a spiritual teacher must not be reviled') and Ap. Dh. S. I. 11. 31. 5 (' he shall not speak harsh or abusive words of the gods or of the king'). Manu VII. 3-4 are the same as Sukranitisāra 1.71-72. The Matsyapurāṇa 226. 1 states that the king was created by Brahmā by taking portions of gods for wielding the power of punishment for the protection of all beings. Manu ( IX. 303-311 ) puts forward a slightly diluted theory, viz, the king should possess the majesty of and imitate in his actions the first seven deities enumerated above with the Earth as the 8th and Manu sets out what the eight characteristic actions are. Matsya 226. 9-12 are the same as Manu IX. 303-306. The Agnipurāṇa ( 226. 17-20 ) states that as the king exercises the functions of nine deities viz. the Sun, the Moon, Vāyu, Yama, Varupa, Fire, Kubera, the Earth and Vispu he has the form of these. Vide Sukranitisāra I. 73-79 for similar ideas. These verses do not amount to the express theory of divine origin, but assimilate by analogy the king's functions to those of certain deities. The Nārada-smrti (prakirnaka section, verses 20-31 ) contains 27 several interesting dicta. It says that in the form of the king it is really Indra himself who moves about on the earth (v. 20 ), that a king even when devoid of qualities deserves honour from the people, that kings exercise the functions of five deities viz. of Agni, Indra, Soma, Yama

and Kubera (vv. 26-31). The Mārkandeyapurāna (27. 21-26 ) mentions the same five deities. "The Veda says that when a king is chosen it is Indra himself that is chosen; one desirous of prosperity should honour the king just as one worships Indra'-says Sānti 67, 4. Sānti 69 states that all the gods are invisible, but the king is a deity that can be seen. The Vāyu purana (57. 72 ) remarks 28 that in all past and futuro manvantaras universal emperors ( cakravartin) are born on the earth with parts of Viṣṇu. The Matsyapurāṇa (226. 1–12 ) mixes up the theory of the creation of the king from parts of the gods with the lesser idea of his functions being similar to those of certain deities. The Bhagavata-purāṇa (IV. 14. 26-27) states that Viṣnu, Brahmā, Siva, Indra, Vāyu, Varuṇa -- these and other gods-exist in the body of the king and that the king is full of (the parts of ) all gods. It is to strengthen this con ception that ancient kṣatriya dynasties and their panegyrists tried to trace for those dynasties descent from the Sun or the Moon and in later times from Fire. The practice of addressing the king as 'deva' in Sanskrit dramas is due to the same tendency of the glorification of the royal office. Asoka was styled 'devānām priya' (beloved of the gods ) and Kushana emperors like Kaniṣka and Huviska styled themselves Devaputra (E. I. vol. I. pp. 371 at pp. 381 and 386). This phenomenon is not confined to India. Alexander the Great and Julius Cæsar had their descent traced to gods and goddesses. Alexander was deified during his life-time in 324 B. C. by the Greek world (vide Cambridge Ancient History, vol. VI. p. 433 ) and Cæsar's image was carried among those of the immortal gods. Kautilya (I. 13 ) makes a spy say among pauras and jānapadas 'kings are (in) the place of (perform the functions of) Indra and Yama, since they visibly inflict punishment and bestow favours. Even divine punishment affects those who despise them ( kings ). Therefore kings should not be despised'. Hence it must be said that the conception of the divine nature of the kingly office was well-known in Kautilya's days and he was not above recommending the employment of this conception for safe guarding the king's position. Vide Rāmāyana, III. 1. 18-19 and VII. 76. 37-45 and Mārkandeyapurana 24. 23-28, Viṣnudharmot tara IL 2. 9 for similar ideas. The phrase 'nā viṣnuḥ prthivipatih'

Divine character of kingship 

is well-known and may be interpreted in two ways viz. the Tuler of the earth is Viṣṇu incarnated as man or no king is not Viṣnu i. e. every king is Viṣnu. The Pancatantra * (I. 120 p. 19) statos · Manu has declared that the king is made up (of parts) of all gods! The Rājanstiprakāśa is careful to point out that the idea of the king having in him parts of the deities applied only to the mahārāja ( the sovereign ruler), while the idea of a ruler doing the functions of five deities applies to vassal kings. 20 For eulogy of the kingly office, vide Manu VII. 6–17, śānti 63, 24-30, Sānti 68, Kām. I. 9-11, Rājanltiprakāśa pp. 17-31. 

But it should not be supposed that this glorification of the king resulted in the full-fledged theory of the divine right of kings or that every king, however bad, was looked upon as a divinity or could do what he liked. In the first place, the Rāja. nitiratnākara 31 (p. 83 ) when speaking of the coronation of a prince by his abdicating royal father quotes a verse where the peuple (prajā) themselves are called Viṣnu. In the second place the king's authority over brāhmaṇas was limited ( vide H. Dh. vol. II. part 1 pp. 139-140). The Gautama-dharmasūtra ( XI. 1,7 and 8) says 3 'the king rules over all, except over brāhmaṇas; all, except brāhmanas, should while sitting low on the ground wait upon ( worship ) him ( the king ) who occupies a high seati they (the brāhmaṇas ) too should honour him'. From the time of the Ait. Br. (37.5) the harmony between the king and the brāhmaṇas and the king's following the advice of brāhmanas had been insisted upon. Vide Ait. Br. 40. 1, Gaut. VIII. 1. XI. 27. Further the Sukranitisāra (1 70) states that a king who oppresses the subjects and causes loss of dharma is made up of the parts of rūkṣasas. 33 Manu (VII. 111-112 ) states that

the king who harasses his subjects loses his life, family and kingdom. Moreover stories of kings killed for their tyranny are found in the ancient Literature. For example, Vena, who was jealous of the gods, wanted sacrificial offerings to be made to himself (and not to the gods ) and violated dharma, was killed by the brāhmaṇas ( Sāntiparva 59. 93-95, Bhagavata purāna IV. 14). The Anuśāsanaparva 34 ( 61. 32-33 ) solemnly sanctions the killing of a king in certain circumstances " The people should gird themselves up and kill a cruel king who does not protect his subjects, who extracts taxes and simply robs them of their wealth, who gives no lead. Such a king is Kali (evil and strife ) incarnate. That king who after declaring 'I shall protect you' does not protect his subjects should be killed (by the people ) after forming a confederacy, like a dog that is afflicted with madness". Manu (VII. 27-28) states that the great principle of danda if properly wielded conduces to the advancement of the three puruṣārthas, but if a voluptuous, mean and unjust king wields it, it recoils on his head and destroys the king together with his relations. Kām. 2. 38 makes it clear that danda foolishly wielded might exasperate even hermits. The Santiparva 92. 19 recommends that a king who has false and very wicked ministers and who puts down dharma should be killed by the people. Even as early as the Tai. S. II. 3. 1 it appears that kings were driven away, while the Satapatha Brāhmaṇa ( XII. 9. 3. 1 and 3) mentions a king Dustaritu Paumsāyana who had been expelled from the kingdom which had descended to him through ten ancestors. The Sautrāmaṇi iṣti is prescribed as a rite for a king to regain a kingdom from which he had been driven away (vide H. Dh. vol. II. p. 1227). Sānti 92. 6 and 9, Manu VII. 27 and 34, Yāj. I. 356 appear to justify at least deposing a king, if not tyrannicide. Similarly, the Sukranitisāra ( II. 274-275 ) states as that a king, though of a noble pedigree, should be abandoned, if he violates dharma, if he hates good qualities ( in others ), lines of policy and the army and if his conduct would lead to the destruction of the kingdom and that the family priest with the consent of the principal

King's liabilities 

officers of state should place on the throne another scion of the royal family who is possessed of the requisite virtues. Nārada props up the theory of divine right by stating that the king secures dominion over (lit. purchases ) his subjects by his austerities ( performed in former lives) and therefore the king is their lord ( prakirṇaka 25). Sukraniti I. 20 also brings in the doctrine of Karma ' the king holds the earth by the actions of his former lives and by his austerities.' Compare Manu VII. 111-112, Sānti 78. 36. The Sukranltisāra (IV. 7. 332-333 ) says that brāhmanas may even fight and destroy an oppressive ksatriya king and would thereby incur no sin. The Yasastilaka ( HII. p. 431 ) gives examples of kings killed by their subjects, one being a Kalinga king who made a barber his commander-in chief. In fact in all works on polity we find coinparatively little about the king's rights and special privileges, but on the other hand the greatest emphasis is laid on the king's duties and responsibilities. Some works describe the king as a servant of the people whose wages or remuneration for the protection he affords is the taxes he raises. Vide Baud. Dh. 8. I. 10. 1, Sukraniti I. 188, Nārada (prakırṇaka 48), Sānti 71. 10.36 It may be said here that the apparently inconsistent dicta about the divinity of the king and about his being liable to be deposed or even killed for evil deeds are delivered from two different standpoints and are addressed to different persons. The writers believed in maintaining the status quo about the duties of varṇas and asramas, in the privileges of the respective castes and in the progressive deterioration of dharma in the ages to come and wanted a strong king to preserve the social order; therefore the king was raised to divinity and absolute obedience to his orders was demanded. This was addressed to the people in general. There was danger however of bad kings and ministers oppressing the people by misrule. Hence the king and his ministers were threatened with destruction and death. These dicta were principally meant for the king and his advisers. 

In the Kauçiliya V. 3 we meet with these words “In Rajasūya and other solemn (or elaborate ) sacrifices the "rājn' gets three times the salary given to others who are as learned as he is" (samānavidyebhyas-triguṇavetano rājā rājasūyādiṣu

kratuṣu ). Jayaswal (in 'Hindu Polity' part II. p. 136 ) seices upon this passage to show that the king was a salaried person like the prime minister or the commander-in-chief. The words * in Rajasūya and other kratus' should have raised doubts in his mind about his interpretation, but he entirely missed the significance of the passage. Kautilya in that passage is not referring to the king himself but to his representative or deputy when the king is engaged in numerous ceremonial duties during sacrifices of long duration like the Asvamedha. The Ap. Srautasūtra (XX. 3. 1-2), Baudhāyana Srauta XV. 4, Satyāsādha Sr. XIV. 1. 24-25 state that the adhvaryu priest was to deputize for the king when the latter was engaged in the Aśvamedha 37 ( which was spread over a period of about two years). The salary referred to by Kautilya is to be paid to the adhvaryu when representing the king. Vide H. Dh. vol. II. p. 1232 for this. In X. 3 it is said by Kautilya that a virtuous king on the eve of a battle should urge on his soldiers the fact I am a wage-earner like yourselves, this kingdom is to be enjoyed by me along with you. You have to strike down the enemy pointed out by me". 88 Here the theory of the king being a wage-earner or a servant of the State is em. phasized in a striking manner, 

The word 'rājan' is derived in the Nirukta (II. 3) from the root 'rāj' to shine, but the Mahābhārata (Santi 59, 125 ) likes to say that the king is styled “rājā' since he keeps all people contented, that is, it derives the word 'rājan' from the root 'ranj'. Great poets like Kalidasa (Raghu IV. 12) follow the Mahābhārata in this, as also in deriving the word ‘ksatriya' from "kṣata' and the root 'trai', meaning one who protects from wound and injury (Śānti 59. 126 and Raghu-vamsa II. 53). Br. quoted in the Rāja. Dh. K. (I. p. 5) appears to derive the word both from 'rāj' and 'rañj' (balena caturangeṇa yato rañjayati prajaḥ 1 dipyamānaḥ sa vapuṣā tena rājābhidhsyate). 

There are in our authorities germs of several theories about the origin of kingship. Rg. X. 173 (which corresponds to

Origin of kingship 

29 

Atharvaveda VI. 87 and 88.1-2) has been taken as an election hymn by some writers (0.8. Jayaswal in 'Hindu polity' p. 7). But one is constrained to say that it is probably nothing of the kind. The only words that may lend some colour to the theory of election are ' let all the people desire thee (as king)' in Rs. X. 173, 1, but those words may apply as a benediction even in the case of one who is already a king. In the Atharva veda III. 4. 2 there *' is a reference to the election of a king by the people the people (viśah) chose thee to govern the kingdom, these quarters, the five goddesses (chose thee)'. In Atharvavada III. 5, 6 and 7 also there is a faint allusion to the election of a king by nobles, king-makers, sūtas and headmen of villages, by the clever makers of chariots and the skilled workers in metals. These 'king-makers' are called 'ratnins' in other Vedic texts and the Tai. Br. I. 7.3 states in connection with the twelve offerings in the Rājasūya called 'ratninām havimṣi' that the 

ratnins' give the (rāṣtra) kingdom (to the king). Vide H. Dh. vol. II. p. 1215 n 2648 and p. 1216 for the 'ratnins'. So it appears that the conception was that the king got the kingdom from nobles, high functionaries and the common people. For the coronation bath (and its implications) mentioned in the Ait. Br. vide note 105 below. The Ayodhyākānda (chap. 1 and 2) describes how Dasaratha when he grew old desired to make his eldest son Rāma the Crown Prince (yuvarāja), how he called together an assembly of vassal kings, citizens and rural inhabi tants and placed before the assembly his idea, how they acclaimed loudly the old emperor's proposal and readily gave their consent. This shows that though kingship became hereditary in course of time some element of popular approval was sought for. But such passages referring to the approval of the people cannot be stretched to mean that the king was chosen by a parliament the members of which were elected by the people. All that happened appears to have been only this that citizens that approved assembled spontaneously and expressed their feelings in the assembly. In the Rāmāyaṇa II. 67. 2 it is said that when Dasam ratha died sages like Mārkandeya and Vāmadeva declared along with the amatyas in the presence of the family priest (purohita) Vasiṣtha that as Rama and Lakṣmana had gone into exile and Bharata and Satrughna were in the Kekaya country, some scion

of the Ikṣvāku race should be chosen as king. These sages and ministers are spoken of as king-makers ('rāja-kartārab') here and in chap. 79. 1. In the Adiparva 44. 6 it is stated that all the citizens of the capital in one voice elected Janamejaya, though a boy, as a king on the death of Parikṣit and Janamejaga ruled with the help of his ministers and purohita. There are histo rical examples of the election of kings. The kṣatrapa Rudradā man was elected king by the people of Surāṣtra (who at one time formed a republic, acc. to Kautilya XI. 1) and he took an oath as stated in his Junagadh inscription in the year 72 (150 A. D.). *0 Vide E. I Vol. VIII p. 36 at p. 40. Gopāla, the founder of the Pāla dynasty of Bengal (730-740 A. D.), was elected a king (E. I. Vol. IV, p. 243 at p. 248 and Jayaswal's History of India,' 150-350 A. D. pp. 44-45). It appears that it was the business of the chief ministers and brāhmaṇas to propose some body as king and such persons were called 'rājakartāral'. In Ayodhyā 67. 8 they say 'our country is without a ruler and may therefore encounter disaster'. Arājaka does not necessarily mean in Ayodhyā 67 anarchy but a condition in which there is no king nor ruler. Though this is so, it is not possible to agree with Mr. K. P, Jayaswal ('Hindu Polity', part I, pp. 97-98, 134, 173) that'arājaka' was 'an idealistic constitution, that it was an extreme democracy almost Tolstoian in ideal, that it was based on a legal and communal basis, that it was a case of extreme individualism in which government itself was regarded as an evil.' Ayodhya 67. 8-31, Adi, 41. 27 ff., Santi 67. 3 ff., Matsyapurāṇa 225. 8-9 are the principal passages on arājaka. A perusal of these will convince any one not carried away by the over-patriotic desire to find the latest European thought in our ancient books that arājaka was viewed as a state of chaos and the negation of any constitution; that when a country was without a ruler, no private property in anything existed or was respected and people preyed upon each other like fishes (Ayo dhyā 67, 31) and that no Tolstoian ideals were present before the eyes of the writers that drew such a harrowing picture of a State without a ruler.

treacherously murdered by king Saśānka, the great minister Bhandin (who was also a cousin of Harsa) called an assembly of ministers and made to the young Harṣavardhana a proposal to assume the royal authority, which proposal was backed up by all the ministers and magistrates, that thereupon Harṣa agreed to become king after consulting the oracle of Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva. After the death of Parameśvaravarman II (of the Pallava dynasty), when the Pallava kingdom was subject to anarchy, the subjects chose a king. For the details of this elec tion, vide the important constitutional document of the Vai kuntha Perumal temple (Dr. C. Minakshi's 'Administration and Social life under the Pallavas', 1938, p. 38). The Rājatarangipi narrates (V. 461-463) that Yasaskara who was originally a poor man was chosen as king by the brāhmaṇas. 

In some other places a theory somewhat like the theory of social contract expounded by Rousseau is adumbrated. The theory of social contract is presented in modern times under two forms. In one there is supposed to be a tacit or explicit agreement between the Government and the people. In the 2nd form it is supposed that a political society was constituted by a compact among individuals (to which the ruler was not a party). This theory puts forward the notion that government depended on the consent of the people. Kautilya (I. 13) refers to the legend that Manu Vaivasvata was made a king by the people, who agreed to assign one-sixth of the grain raised by them ag the king's share in return for the protection afforded by him. But Kautilya is silent as to whether Manu made any promise to the people. Sāntiparva, chap. 59, states how Vainya, the first king, was called upon by the gods and sages to take an oath and how he promised them that he would protect the world, and would carry out his duties as laid down in the science of govern ment and not act at his sweet will." When this theory of an agreement between the king who took an oath and the people spread among the people, the theory of the divine right of kings, if ever seriously held, would recede more and more into the back-ground. Vide Dr. Beni Prasad's 'Theory of Government in Ancient India'chap. VIII and 'Pro-Buddhist India' (1939) by Mr. R. N. Mehta, chap. II pp. 79 ff. and 101 for election of

kings and for Buddhist theories of government. It is not possi ble to hold as Jayaswal, U. Ghosal and others do (e. g. 'Manu and Yajnavalkya' II, 'Hindu Polity' part II pp. 54-57) that the theory of social contract was the earlier one and that the theory of divine right of kings was later on propounded by the Manu smrti to support the brāhmana empire of Puṣyamitra. Jaya swal is wrong in saying (in 'Hindu Polity' part II p. 57) 'the theory of the Mānava was never approved or adopted by a single subsequent law-book'. It has been shown above that Nārada and others espoused the same theory. Manu himself eulogises the supreme power of daṇda over the king himself (Manu VII. 28). He makes use of both the theories as occasion demands. 

The germ of the theory of Divine Right of kings probably goes back even to the Rgveda. Rg. IV. 42 is a hymn of king Tragadasyu, son of Purukutsa. Some of the ideas therein are startling enough. He says 'the gods rely on the might of Varuṇa, while I am the lord of the people (verse 1, krutum sacante Varunasya devā rājāmi krsteh &c); I am Indra and Varuṇa, I am the wide and the deep Heaven and Earth, I am the son of Aditi (verses 3 and 4)'. Here there is an explicit claim by a king to be identical with the mightiest and greatest gods of the Vedic pantheon. In the Atharvaveda VI. 87.1-2 it is said about the king ‘May all the people long for you, may not the kingdom be lost from your hands, may you stand firm in the world like Indra and may you uphold the kingdom'. In the Satapatha Brāhmaṇa V. 1. 5. 14 (when describing the shooting of arrows in the Vājapeya) it is said 'the rājanya is most manifestly of Prajāpati, while being one he rules over many'. Here the posi tion of the rājanya appears to be regarded as due to his being the representative of Prajāpati. In the Sat. Br. V. 4. 3. 4 the sacrificer in the Rājasūya is identified with Indra and it is said that that position is due to two causes viz. (1) his being a member of the kṣatriya order and (2) his participating in a solemn sacrifice. But passages like the last and Sat. Br. V. 1. 3. 4, V. 1. 4. 2, V. 2. 2. 14 should not be relied upon in support of the theory of the divine right of kings (as done by U. Ghoshal in * Hindu Political Theories', pp. 28-29), since every participator (whether a brāhmaṇa or a kṣatriya) in such solemn sacrifices as the Agnistoma and Vājapeya was supposed to possess a celes tial body after dikṣā and Pravargya and was often spoken of as identified with Indra and other gods. Visvarūpa on Yāj. I. 350 quotes a long vedic passage (agama) in which it is stated "tho gods said to Prajapati 'we shall arrange for a king in fiuman

form by taking from the moon, the sun, Indra, Viṣnu, Vaiśra vapa (Kubera) and Yama respectively majesty, brilliance, valour, victoriousness, liberality and control" and that the king thus formed asked the gods to give to him Dharma as his friend and that then he would protect the people and then the gods made Dharma (i. e. danda) his friend. 

We may examine the theories of the origin of kingship in the Mahābhārata. The śāntiparva deals with this subject in two places, in chap. 59 and 67. In chap. 59 Yudhiṣthira asks the great warrior and statesman Bhiṣma how the title 'king' arose and how one man, who has fundamentally the same physical and mental equipment as other men, rules over all men. These are not really two questions but only two aspects of the same question. Then Bhisma starts by saying that there was originally a state of perfection (Kṛtayuga) in which there was no king, no kingdom, no punishment and no chastiser. Gradually moha (delusion or aberration of mind) spread among people and then greed, sexual desire and passions arose and the Vedas and dharma perished. The gods did not receive offerings and went to Brahma, who composed a vast treatise as stated above (p. 4 ) that dealt with the four goals of existence for the benefit of the world and that was the cream of learning. Then the gods went to Viṣnu and requested him to appoint (as king) one who deserved to be the best among men. Viṣṇu created a son from his mind called Virajas who did not want to be a king. Fifth in descent from Virajas was Vena who destroyed dharma and so the brāhmaṇas killed him and from his right arm they churned Pșthu, handsome, well-armed and proficient in the Vedas, Vedāngas and Daṇdaniti. Gods and sages asked him to follow settled dharma, to control his senses and to take an oath (set out above in note 41). He was crowned by the gods and sages for the protection of the people. Vispu himself esta blished him saying 'Oh king, no man will go contrary to your order' and then Vianu entered the king Pșthu (verse 128) and it is therefore that this world since then bows to kings as to gods. In this account the oath administered to Pṛthu was so administered by the gods and sages and not by the people in the mags, nor does Pfthu expressly promise anything to the people as such. Probably it was thought that the promise to the sages was impliedly a promise to the people in general. But the account, such as it is, rather appears to emphasize the divine origin of kingship.

History of Dharmaśāstra 

( Vol. 

Chap. 67 contains a much shorter version of the origin of kingship, probably because a few chapters before another vers ion has already been given or because it embodies the views of some prior work or teacher. It begins by saying that the most desirable thing for a State is to crown a king, that in a kinglese country there is no dharma, no security of life nor of property, that therefore the gods appointed kings for protecting people. Then it proceeds to say that the people assembled and made compacts ( sumuyān) amongst themselves that whoever would commit libel or assault or adultery and break the compacts made by the people should be abandoned. All people went to Brahmā and requested him to appoint a ruler whom they would all honour and who would protect them. Brahmā appointed Manu for that purpose, but Manu did not at first like the idea, saying 'Govern ment is a very difficult business among men who are always deceitful and I am afraid of the sinful acts of men'. The people asked him not to be afraid as the sing committed by men will affect the perpetrators (and not Manu) and that the people would give him shares of produce (one-tenth of grain, one-fifth of cattle, one-fourth of their dharma &c.). Manu then agreed, went round the world, terrorizing evil-doers and making them conform to dharma. This story about Manu and the people is alluded to by Kautilya (vide p. 31 above). Even here Manu promises nothing expressly, while the people agree to pay taxes and answer for their own sins. There is no doubt that some of the details in the two chapters are different. In chap. 67 there is no reference to an original state of perfection nor to a yast work nor to any oath; so also in one it is Vainya who becomes the first king and in the other it is Manu. But the conception in both is mythological and the fundamental fact in both is the same. God gives a king to the people in both, when they were without a king and degeneracy had set in. Though there is no offer to give a share in chap. 59 yet it is to be inferred from the matijñā of Vainya that every subsequent king was deemed to do the same. It may be said that in chap. 67 there is a blending of the theory of Divine Right and of an original compact between king and people. In both, however, the emphasis is on the theory of the divine origin of kingship. Santi 67. & states *one desirous of prosperity should honour the king as one, honours Indra', while chap. 59, 139 asks "what is the cause but the divine character (the king possesses) on account of which people remain under his control'? It must be said that in both 

II) 

Origin of kingship 

35 

chapters of the Sāntiparva there is no proper theory of contract between king and people. 

The Nāradasmrti as indicated above (pp. 23,27 and note 27) is a thorough-going advocate of the theory of divine right. It says (prakirṇaka 20-22 ) It is Indra himself who moves about on the earth as king; people can nowhere live after transgressing his orders. Since the privilege of protection is his because of his supreme power (inajesty ) and on account of the fact that he is benign to all creatures, the settled rule is that whatever a king does is right. Just as the husband, though weak, must be honoured by the wife, so a ruler though devoid of qualities must be honoured by his subjects'. Verse 25 inculcates the duty of obedience to the king. 

According to Mr. J. N. Figgis in his book The divine right of kings' (1934) pp. 5–6, the theory of the Divine Right of kings in its completest form involved the following propositions : (I) monarchy is a divinely ordained institution; (II) hereditary right is indefeasible i. e. the right acquired by birth and descend ing by the law of primogeniture cannot be forfeited through any acts of usurpation, or by any incapacity of the heirs or by any act of deposition; (III) kings are accountable to God alone, i.e. a limited monarchy is a contradiction in terms; (IV) non resistance and passive obedience are enjoined by God i. e. in any circumstances resistance to the king is a sin and leads to damnation and that when the king issues a command directly contrary to God's law, the latter is to be obeyed and also all penalties attached to the breach of the king's law are to be patiently borne. This theory was very much to the fore in the 16th and 17th centuries when in Europe theology and politics were in close union. 

It is to be seen how far the ancient Hindu theory agreed with this full-fledged theory of the divine right of kings. As regards proposition I it has been shown above that the Manusmrti, the Mahābhārata and other works held that the king was either God himself, or god's vicar or vicegerent performing functions similar to those of several gods. As regards proposi tion II all Sanskrit works recognised hereditary right and primogeniture, but they allowed exceptions as will be shown later on. Our ancient books did not accept the third and the fourth propositions in toto. They say that the king cannot do as he likes, that he has to carry out the diotates of dharma, his

power to make new rules is limited and if he does not act up to the rules of dharma he may be deposed, disobeyed or killed. Vide quotations from Sukraniti and Anuśāsanaparva cited above. When Manu (VII. 111-112) says that a king who harasses his kingdom loses his life, his family and his kingdom, it is implied that people are not bound to suffer silently all the wrongs heaped upon them by a bad king but that they may turn round and either depose him or kill him. Fick (pp. 103-104) gives examples from the Buddhist Jatakas where bad kings were killed by the people and others were elected in their place. There is no doubt that obedience to the king is enjoined by Nārada and others, but it is due to the king only so long as he does not swerve from the path of right and virtue. Nārada * (prakirṇaka verses 12 and 32 ) says 'on account of his majesty and sanctity a king and brāhmana are not to be abused if they do not swerve from the right path; one should not treat with contempt or scold the king, one should abide by his order, since (the penalty of) death may follow from violating it (king's order )'. Here the duty of obedience is not based on the divine origin of kingship, but on the practical wordly ground that an offended king may punish with death. Nārada's doctrine does not lead to the requirement of absolute submission and non-resistance to a wicked king. 

It is impossible to hold that the theory of divine right was put forward as a counterblast to the theory of social contract. The theory of divine right would arise very naturally even in the oldest days, while the theory of social contract is the product of a more advanced stage of political thought. The theory of divine right is not more absurd than the theory of social con tract and was popularly hold not only in India, but in many Christian countries, relying on passages in the Bible such as Daniel 4 and Romans 13, 1-7. The theory of divine right was circumscribed in India by another theory from very ancient times. The cry of the American colonists against England in the 18th century was that taxation and representation went hand in hand ; that of the ancient Hindu political and dharmaśāstra writers was that taxation and protection went hand in hand (see n. 45). Baud. Dh. S. I. 10. 1. says the king being hired for the sixth

part ( that he takes as tax) should protect the subjects'. Yaj. I. 337 states The king shares half of that evil which the subu jects do when not protected by the king, since he takes taxes (from the people)' and Yaj. I. 334 lays down that a king who proteots according to śāstras receives the 6th part of the merit (punya) of the subjects. Sāntiparva (57. 44-45) states 'One should abandon six persons like a leaking boat in the ocean vis. a teacher who does not explain, a priest who does not study the Veda, a king who does not protect &c.' Sukraniti I. 121 affirms 'the gods destroy a king who does not protect, a brāhmaṇa who does not perform austerities, a wealthy man who makes no gifts, Vide Vasiṣtha I. 44-46, Gaut. XI. 11, Viṣnu Dh. 8. III. 28, Udyoga parva 132. 12, śānti 67. 27 ( 4th part of pupya), Santi 24. 12 ( 4th part), Santi 72. 20, Aśramavāsi 3.40, Anuśāsana 61.34 and 36, Kām. II. 10 for the idea that the king receives a part (generally 6th part) of the punya (and also sin) of the people. The king had to protect even forest hermits who paid no taxes, as he would share in their punya 48. Vide Rāmāyaṇa III. 6. 14. Kālidāsa echoes this in the Sakuntala II. 13. Adiparva 213.9 looks upon the king who takes the sixth part as tax and affords no protection as the arch-sinner in the world. Sānti 71.29 says that the spiritual merit that a king gathers by protection according to the sacred code yields rewards for him in heaven for ten thousand years. 

From the preceding pages it is clear that the following are put forward as the grounds on which the obligation to render obedience to the ruler is based: (1) the king has divinity in him, (2) the great utility of the ruler affording protection as regards life, liberty and property, (3) the fear of punishment (Manu VII. 22), (4) a primeval contract between the ruler and the people, (5) the interdependence of the ruler and the people as parts of one organism (viz, the State). Vide Medhātithi on Manu IX. 294 for this last. 

Who should be king? There were several views on this point. One meaning of the word 'rājan' is ‘ksatriya', Manu (VII. 1) states that he will declare rājadharmas and in the very next verse he employs the word “ksatriya' and remarks that a ksatriya who has undergone the upanayana sarskāra (or abhiseka according to some commentators) should afford protection to all in his kingdom. Therefore a ksatriya is the most proper person

to be a king. Some of the works such as the Rajadharma-kaus tubha, Rājanitiprakāśa, the Nitimayūkha, and Par, M. vol. I. pp. 449-451 refer to the discussion in the Pūrvamimānsā works on the topic of the Avesti sacrifice. On Jaimini II. 3.3 Sabara and Kumārila hold an elaborate discussion. The Vedio texts say "rājā rājasūyena yajeta' ('the Rājasūya should be performed by a rajan'). Among the numerous constituents of that sacrifice there is an iṣti called Aveṣti, with reference to which a vedic passage says 'if a brāhmaṇa performs avesti. he places the āhuti (offering) for Bphaspati in the middle, if a ksatriya performs it the offering to Indra is placed in the middle of the offerings &c.'. The pūrvapakṣa (prima facie view) is that the word 'rājan' applies to any one (whether a brāhmaṇa, a kṣatriya or a vaisya) who protects the people. The siddhanta (the established conclusion) is that in this text the word rājan means a kṣatriya and that by the other passage about brah maṇas &o, what is meant is that brāhmaṇas and vaisyas may independently perform the Aveṣti sacrifice, but that only a ksatriya can perform the Aveṣti as part of the Rājasūya rites. Sabara makes the interesting remark that in the Andhra country the word 'rājan' is applied to a man of the ksatriya caste even though he does not pursue the occupation of protecting a country or a city; while Kumārila observes that persons of all the four varpas are seen as rulers of kingdoms. ** In the literature on dharmaśāstra the word 'rājan' is understood in the sense of one whoʻrules over or protects a country' (i. e. the pārvapakṣa view 

in the Pūrvamīmānsā). Vide Medhātithi on Manu VII. 1. Aparārka"s (on Yāj. I. 366) remarks "when he who is not a kṣatriya performs the work of a kṣatriya (i. e. becomes a king) he should do all this ( that a ksatriya king has to do) since the maxim is 

that by assuming the position or the work of a particular person or thing one receives what is due to that other' and the

duty of protecting the subjects arises from the fact of taking taxes from them. For everyone when giving wealth doos 80 with reference to a purpose related to himself and there is no purpose except one's protection that is intended in rendering taxes. Hence it is established that whoever receives taxes must secure protection of the subjects". According to Kullūka the word 'rājan' means 'any person who is crowned king and pro tects the country and capital' and is not used in the sense of a person of the kṣatriya caste'. The Rājanitiratnakara (p. 2) after citing Kullūka and Kamadhenu states that many hold that "rājan' means any one who takes upon himself the task of protecting the subjects'. The Rājanitiprakāśa holds a long discussion (pp. 10-15), states that the word 'rājan'may have three meanings viz. any one who protects people, a kṣatriya in general or a ksatriya who is crowned and ultimately gives it as its opinion that the word 'rājan' is applied in popular usage to any one, whether crowned as king or not, who is the ruler of a country. The Vaijayanti on Viṣnu Dh. S. III. 44 explaing *rājāām' as 'of kṣatriyas' by following the Aveṣti māxim. 

Several brāhmaṇa families founded kingdoms and empires. Pusyamitra, founder of the Sunga empire, was a brāhmaṇa (Harivamsa III. %. 35 ff, E. I. vol. 20 p. 54 ); the Kāṇvāyanas, who followed the Sungas, were brāhmaṇas and so were the Vākātakas, the Kadambas (vide Talagunda pillar Inscription of Kakusthavarman in E. I. vol. VIII. p. 24) and several others. Vide H. Dh. vol. II. pp. 122–123 for texts on the question as to when a brāhmaṇa should follow the profession of arms. Manu XI. 100 states that a brāhmaṇa who knows the Veda deserves to be made a king, a commander-in-chief, the wielder of the power of punishment. Kumārila's dictum that persons of all varnas are seen to be rulers has been already quoted. Gopāla the founder of the Pāla dynastry of Bengal was a sūdra. Manu IV, 61 directs a brāhniana not to stay in a country where the ruler was a sūdra. Medhātithio explains this by saying

that the prohibition applies only to a country where all the seven high functionaries such as the chief minister, the commander in-chief are of the sūdra caste; compare Ap. Dh. 8. I. 11. 32. 18. Manu's dictum related to a time when there was hardly any sūdra king. But the logic of facts was too much for Medhātithi who had to twist the plain words of Manu. Medhātithi on Manu VIII. 1 remarks that persons of other varnas who subsist by the mode prescribed for ksatriyas have power over the kingdom and have to protect the people'. Santiparva remarks that whoever protects people from the hordes of dasyus and wields the power of punishment according to smrti rules must be considered as king. The Harivamsa (III. 3. 6 *akṣatriyāśca rājāno viprāḥ sūdropajivinah') and some of the Purāṇas in depicting the awful degeneracy of the Kali age in a prophetic strain state that the kings in the Kali age will be mostly sūdras and that sūdra kings will celebrate Aśvamedha sacrifices. Vide, for example, Matsya 144.40 and 43 and Linga purīna 40.7 and 42. Hiouen Thsang notices that in the first half of the 7th century A. D. Sind was under a sūdra king ( Beal's B. R. W. W. vol. II. p. 272 ). 

It was almost a universal rule that a male alone was to be the ruler. There appear to have been stray exceptions. The Santiparva ( 33.43-46 ) enjoins " upon a conqueror the duty to place on the throne of a conquered country the brother, son or grandson of the vanquished king and if no prince be available, then to crown even the daughter of the late king. The Raja tarangini (V. 249 and VI. 332) describes at great length the regime of the notorious queens Sugandhā (904-906 A. D.) and Diddā ( 980-81 A. D.) of Kashmir, In India for many centuries there has been no Salic Law expressly declaring that daughters cannot inherit land, though on account of the general position of women, the requirements of disturbed times and military necessity women did not generally assume the role of sovereigns. In a copper-plate grant from Ganjam (of about the 13th century) it is stated that when a certain king named Subhākara died his queen ascended the throne and after her her daughter Dandi mahadevi, who is styled parama-bhattarika-mahārājā dhiraja parameśvari' ruled the earth for a long time ( E. I. vol. VI p. 133 at p. 138). Whether the grandiloquent titles were deserved by the queen or were only the exaggerated effusions of a courtier,

Women as rulers 

it is clear that the widow and daughter of the last male ruler succeeded to the throne. The Raghuvamsa (XIX. 55, 57 ) states that the widowed queen of king Agnivarna sat on the throne and carried on the government with the help of hereditary ministers. 

Apart from conquest and election in rare cases, monarchy was hereditary and generally descended by primogeniture. The passage from the Satapatha Brāhmaṇa (XII. 9.3, 1 and 3) mentioning the descent of kingship for ten generations in succession has already been referred to (p. 26). Though succession was hereditary it was the general rule that the eldest son ascended the throne when the reigning monarch died or abdicated. The rights of the eldest son or daughter as against the younger son or daughter were very jealously guarded in the vedic age. It has already been shown how marrying before one's elder brother or sister was condemned in the vedio age and also in the times of the smṛtis (H. Dh. II. pp. 546-549). Even the Rgveda several times refers to jyaiṣthya (rights of seniority) of Indra (Rg. 1.5.6, TII. 50.3). The Tai. S. II. 2.11.5 states that the gods agreed to treat Indra as the "jyestha' (the eldest) and Tai. S. II. ** 5.2.7 refers to the ancient practice of giving all wealth (of the father) to the eldest son, The Ait. Br. 19,4 narrates the story that the gods did not accept Indra's position as the oldest and most exalted among them and that Indra then induced Bphaspati to perform the Dvādaśāha sacrifice for him, whereby he secured that position. The Nirukta II. 10 sets out the interesting story that Devāpi and Santanu were two brothers, scions of the Kuru family, of whom Devāpi was the eldest, but Santanu the younger one got himself crowned king and so Devāpi practised austeri ties. The result was that there was a drought in Santanu's kingdom for 12 years. The brāhmaṇas said to him "You are guilty of having violated dharma in that passing over the eldest brother you got yourself crowned. Therefore God does not send down rain'. Then Santanu desired to give the kingdom to Devāpi, who however said that he would be his purohita and make him perform a sacrifice. The Rgveda hymn X, 98 was then composed by Devāpi for bringing down rain. This story shows how long before Yāska the popular belief was that it was a great sin to

pass over an elder brother in marriage and other matters and doing so brought down the serious displeasure of the gods. Vide Brhad-devatā. VII. 156-157 and VII. 1-9 for the same story in a little greater detail, viz. that Devāpi suffered from a skin disease, that when Devāpi said to the subjects that he did not deserve the kingdom and that Santanu should be their king, the subjects crowned Santanu as king. When Yayati desired to pass over his elder sons Yadu and others because they disobeyed him and wanted to make the younger Pūru his successor the brāhmaṇas and citizens protested “How can the younger son secure the kingdom passing over the elder one 80'? Arjuna upbraids Bhimasena who got enraged against Yudhisthira * who would act against one's eldest brother that follows the path of dharma?' (Sabhā 68.8). In the Rāmāyaṇa 51 Dasaratha addresses Rāma (II. 3.40 ) ' you are born of my eldest queen, who is of the same class as myself (i. e. of ksatriya blood)' and Vasiṣtha says to Rāma 'Among all Ikṣvākus the eldest son becomes the king'; a younger brother is not crowned king when the elder exists' (II. 110.36 ). The Ayodhyākā da in Beveral places (8.23-24, 101.2 ) reiterates the idea that all the song of a king do not succeed but only the eldest, although the other sons may be equally fit and endowed with qualities. Kautilya (I. 17) 52 states that people esteem rulership going to the eldest except in the case of some calamity. Manu IX, 106 says that by the very birth of the eldest son, a man becomes free from the debt he owes to his pitts and there fore the eldest deserves to get everything from the father. The Rajadharma-k. ( pp. 234-235 ) after quoting the Kālikāpurāpa and the Rāmāyana lays down the following propositions:(1) the aurasa son of a king alone succeeds in preference to the eleven kinds of secondary sons (whether he is junior or senior in age); (2) if the son of a junior queen ( of the same caste ) is senior by birth, he succeeds in preference to the son of the senior queen,

who (son) is younger in age; (3) if two sons are born to two queens at the same moment, the son of the senior queen is preferred ; (4) if twins are born to the senior queen, the son who is born first is to be preferred. 

If the eldest son suffers from a physical or mental defect (such as blindness or lunacy) he is to be passed over and his younger brother becomes king (vide Manu IX, 201 for grounds of exclusion from inheritance). Adiparva $3 109. 25 states that Dhstarāstra because he was blind did not succeed to the kingdom, Vide also Udyoga 147, 39. The Sukranitisāra (1. 343-344) states that if the eldest prince suffers from deafness, dumbness, blindness, leprosy or impotence he is unfit to rule and that in such a case his younger brother or son should succeed. The Sukranitisāra further points out that by dividing a kingdom among the several princes no benefit results, but on the contrary the small parts would fall an easy prey to enemies; therefore when the eldest alone succeeds he should make his younger brothers provincial governors or superintendents over the trea sury, horses &c. (I. 346-348). The Rājadharmakaustubha lays down a few additional propositions: (1) even if the eldest does not succeed owing to some mental or physical defect, his son's right will remain intact and R. D. K. quotes the words of the fisherman chief to Bhisma in Ādi. 100. 92.55 The Bālambhatti on Yāj. I. 309 and Rājanitiprakāśa p. 40 say the same. Another example is that of Anśumān who became king when his father Asamañja was exiled from the state by Sagara for his misdeeds. (2) When a younger son is crowned king because the eldest is disqualified, then after the former's death his son succeeds and not the son of the disqualified eldest son who is born after the coronation of the younger (e. g. Yudhisthira deserved the kingdom on Pandu's death and not Duryodhana ). The Nitivā. kyāmrta ( sec. 24 p. 249) lays down the order of succession in the case of kings as follows: the son, full brother, half-brother, uncle, a nale of the same family, daughter's son, a stranger (who is either elected or who takes up the kingdom 56).

History of Dharmaśāstra 

[ Vol. 

Sometimes a king selected a younger son to succeed him, There are famous historical examples. The great Gupta Emperor Samudragupta though a younger son was nominated by his father Chandragupta I to succeed and by his brilliant and most successful career Samudragupta more than justified the choice. Vide the Allahabad Pillar Inscription verse 4 (Gupta Inscrip tions p. 6). Similarly Chandragupta II, though younger, was nominated by his father Samudragupta to succeed himself, Yayāti selected his youngest son Pūru because he was devoted and obedient and the eldest and other sons disobeyed him. Vide Adiparva chap. 75 ff. and above p. 42. The principle of hereditary succession was so strong that even a boy king was placed on the throne. Vide Raghu. XVIII, 39. 

In almost all works on rājaśāstra there is a disquisition on the qualities that a good king should possess. Vide Kaut. VI. 1, Manu VII. 32-44, Yāj. I. 309-311 and 334, Saṅkha-Likhita 

quoted in R. D. K. III. p. 14 and Rājaniti-prakāśa p. 116, Santi 57. 12 ff. and 70, Kam. I. 21-22, IV. 6-24, XV. 31, Māna Bollāsa II. 1.1-9 (p. 29), Sukra I. 73-86, Viṣnudharmottara II. 3, Only one or two passages can be set out here. Yāj. (I. 309-311 and 334) states 'a king should have great energy, should be generous, mindful of past (good or bad) turns done by others, dependent on those who are advanced (in austerities, knowledge and experience), possessed of a disciplined mind, endowed with an even temper (in good or bad luck), born of a noble family (on both sides), truthful, pure (in body and mind), prompt in action, of strong memory, not mean-minded, not harsh (in words or acts), observant of the rules of dharma (as to varnas and aśramas), free from vices, talented, brave, clever in concealing secrets (or acc. to Bhāruchi and Aparārka 'clever in scenting the secrets of his enemies'), guarding the weak points of his state, well-taught as regards logic, the science of govern ment, the science of wealth and the three vedas. He should be forbearing towards brāhmaṇas, straightforward towards his friends, wrathful towards his enemies, and should be (kind) like a father towards his servants and subjects'. Manu VII. 32 is very similar to Yāj. I. 334. The Mit. says that the qualities specified in Yāj. I. 309-311 are antaranga (inward or more essen tial). The 2nd quality 'sthūla-lakṣa' occurs also in the inscrip tion of Rudradāman (E. I. vol. VIII. at p. 44). From I. 312 Yaj. states the bahiranga qualities viz. selection of ministers, purohita and sacrificial priests, gifts to worthy brāhmaṇas, protection &c. 

III ) 

Qualities required in a king 

Kautilya VI. 1 contains several lists of the king's qualities from several points of view. First, there is a list of qualities that make the king win the heart of the people (or make him approa chable) viz, being of a noble family, godly, spirited, consulting the aged, virtuous, truthful, not failing in his promises, grateful, taking broad views (not pusillanimous), highly enthusiastic, not given to procrastination, powerful enough to control his feudatories, firm in mind, having a council of ministers of no mean calibre, desirous of self-discipline. These are called 'ābhi gāmika-gunas' which word occurs in the Palitana plates of Dharagena II (of Valabhi) in E.I. vol. XI p. 83 and in the Māliya plate of the same king (Gupta Ins. pp. 164, 169 ). The Dasakumāra carita VII appears to make a pointed reference to this list when it makes a character say that the king (there referred to ) has in him all the qualities beginning from good family (sarvai. vātma-sampad-abhijanāt-prabhrti &c.) Then the intelleotual qualities he should possess are: desire to learn, study, under standing of what is studied and retaining it, reflection, discus sion and devotion to the principles accepted after discussion, Almost the same qualities of the intellect( dhi) are mentioned by Kām. IV, 22. The word 'sakyasāmanta'(in Kaut, VI. 1) occurs also in Agnipurāṇa 239. 4. The qualities that are the different aspects of his enthusiasm (or energy ) are: valour, non-endurance (of the might of others), quickness (of action) and assiduity. The same occur in Kām. IV. 23. Then follows a long list of quali ties that go to make up the personal endowment of the king (atma-sampat). Gaut. (XI. 2, 4-6) requires that the king should 

do what is right (acc. to śāstras ) and speak (or decide) rightly, should be pure (at heart and externally), should control his senses, be possessed of qualified servants and endowed with knowledge of the means of policy, should be even-handed towards all his subjects and look after their welfare. The long list of Saṅkha-likhita agrees more or less with those of Kautilya and Yaj. Santiparva 70 states that the king should possess 36 quali ties, viz. he should not speak bitterly, he should be godly, not wicked, not haughty, of agreeable address &c. Kām. I. 21-22 mentions 19 qualities that lead to the well-equipped personality of the king (ātma-sampat), viz. study of sāstra (Dandaniti), intellect, serenity, cleverness, boldness, power of comprehension, energy, eloquence, firmness, capacity to endure the worries of adversities, majesty, purity, kindness, liberality, truthfulness, gratefulness, noble family, character, self-restraint. Then Kām. jo IV. 15-19 sets out the qualities called ātma-sampat, which 

46 

· History of Dharmasastra 

( Vol. 

generally agree with Kautilya's enumeration (in VI. 1). Acc. to Kām. IV. 24 liberality, truthfulness and valour are the three greatest qualities in a king, who, when endowed with these, aoquires all other qualities. The Managollāsa (II. 1. 2-7) first enumerates 44 qualities such as truthfulness, spiritedness (which agree more or less with Kautilya's enumeration) and then states that the five most essential qualities in a king are truthfulness, valour, forbearance, liberality and capacity to appreciate the worth of others. The Agnipurāṇa (239. 2-5) enumerates 21 qualities such as noble family, character &c. In the Parasurama pratāpa 96 qualities are enumerated in the Rajavallabhakanda (Ms. 239 of Viśrāmabāg collection II, folio 21b). The Sabhāparva 5. 107-109 and Rāmāyaṇa II. 100.65-67 require the king to avoid 14 faults viz. atheism, falsehood, hot temper, carelessness, pro crastination, not seeing the wise, laziness, addiction to five pleasures of sense, considering state matters alone (without mantrins ), taking counsel with those who do not know politics, not starting to do what is decided upon, not guarding secret royal policy, not practising auspicious acts, taking up under takings on all sides at one and the same time. Vanaparva 251. 5 says that subjects do not like a king who is very timid, very weak, procrastinating, careless and immersed in pleasures on account of vices. Sabhā 5. 125 states that sleep (by day), lazi ness, timidity, hot tempor, softness and dilatoriness are six calamities in a king. 

The works on dharmaśāstra and arthaśāstra devote a good deal of space to the education of the king and to his moral dis cipline. Gaut. XI. 3 requires that the king should have received instruction in Trayı ( the three Vedas ) and Anvikṣikl. This last has been differently interpreted by different writers. Kaut. I. 2 says that Antīkṣiki comprehends Sāṅkhya, 57 Yoga and Loka

yata and that it examines the relative strength of the three other vidyās with reasons, and thereby benefits the world, steadies the mind in calamities and prosperity and imparts excellence in intellect, speech and actions. It is always the torch of ( sheds light on) all vidyās, it is the means of (inducing to go in for ) all undertakings, it is the source of all dharmas. Kautilya derives the name from the root 'iks' with 'anu' and he takes it to mean the science of ratiocination. It is somewhat strange that Lokāyata is included in Anvikṣikl, one of the subjects of study for the prince. But it appears from the remarks he makes that Kauṭ, uses it only in the sense of logic based on premises derived from ordinary experience (loka) though in later literature Lokayata came to mean 'nāstika' (atheist, materialist). Acc. ** 

(Continued from last page) III. 3. 53 and 54 states that the Laukāyatikas held the view that conscious ness is a quality of the body (and there is no soul over and above the body). The Tantravārtika runs them down as fools and apes (on Jaimini 1. 3.3). In the Rāmāyana Rāma asks Bharata not to resort to Lokāyatika brāhmanas, who, though childish, look upon tbemselves as learned and who relying on the knowledge acquired by Anvikșiki speak nonsense in spite of the fact that there are principal Dharmaśāstras ( that point out the sensible path ). लोकापतिकान मारतात सेबसे । अनर्धकुशला ते पाला। पण्डिसमानिमः ॥ धर्मशानेषु मुख्यषु विद्यमानेषु दुधाः । बुद्धिमाम्बीक्षिकी प्राप्य निरर्थे प्रवदन्ति ते ॥ अयोध्याकाण्ड 100. 38–39. The Kāmasūtra (1. 2. 30 ) says that the Laukāyatikas hold that a kārsāpaṇa (copper coin) which one is certain of is better than a niṣka (a gold coin) which is doubtful. * Fiat archite: Freigo pia mlar T: FIAT 1. 2. 30. Rajasekhara in his Kāvyamimānsā p. 37 (Gaekwad's O. series, ed. of 1934 ) refers to the opinion of the Laukāyatika logicians that the consciousness in human beings arises from the bhutas (elements) just as the power of intoxication (in wine) is due to the mixture of several ingredients (none of which may by itself be intoxicating). The Nitivākyāmsta p. 76 remarks " the Lokāyatika view leads to the effectuation of worldly affairs, for the king is able to uproot the thorns of the country by the help of Lokāyata", 016FITEETTATUAgi harf i mergaire

to the Amarakośa, Viśvarūpa on Yāj. I. 306, Haradatta on Gaut. (XI. 3), Aparārka and several others Ānyikṣiki means 'Logic'. Acc. to Kām. II. 7 and 11, the Mit. on Yaj. I. 311, Sukraniti I 158 it means 'Atmavidya' (Metaphysics), while Sukraniti I. 153 and Rājaniti-prakāśa p. 118 combine the two by saying that it is logic that leads on to or is useful for acquiring knowledge of the Self. The Nitimayūkha (p. 34) includes logic and Vedānta in Anvikṣiki and Mimānsā and smrtis under Trayi. The Bārhaspatyasūtra (II. 5-6) advises the king to follow the Laukāyatika doctrines at the time of securing artha (wealth ) and the Kāpālika-sāstra in achieving his sexual and similar desires. 59 

Great divergence of views prevailed as to the vidyās that were essential for the education of the king. According to the Manusmrti VII. 43, Santi, 59.33, Kauṭ. I. 2, Yāj. I. 311, Kām. II. %, Sukraniti I. 152, Agni. 238.8, the subjects for the king's education are four viz., Anyikṣiki, Trayi, Vārtā and Dandaniti. Kaut. notes that the school of the Mānavas held the view that the vidyās were three and regarded Anvikṣiki as a special branch of Trayi; that the Bārhaspatya school was of opinion that they were only two, Vārtā and Dandaniti, since Trayi only acted as a screen ( to obscure the intellect) of one (the king ) who wants to know the ways of the world; and the Auśanagas regard ed Daṇdaniti as the only vidyā for a king, since according to them, the efforts to learn all vidyās are tied down to it (i. e. are ultimately intended to lead on to the mastery of Dandaniti). It will be seen how the Auśanasas and Bārhaspatyas had an entirely secular view in the science of government and divorced it from the study of sacred books and metaphysics in the case of the king. The Dasakumiracarita VIII (that displays a deep study of Kautilya) says that the vidyās for the king are four (catasro rajavidyās-traylvārtānvikṣikıdandanitiḥ ). The Bārhas patyasūtrs I. 3 (Dandanstireva vidya) holds that Dandaniti is the only (essential) vidyā for the king. Kautilya further explains that dharma and its opposite are learnt from the three Vedas, viz. Sāmaveda, Rgveda and Yajurveda, that the Atharvaveda and Itihāsaveda (i.e. Itihasa and Puriṇa ) are the other Vedas and that the six Angas also (viz. phonetics, ritual, grammar, etymology, metrics and astronomy) are comprehend

ed in the word “Tray180°. Sukraniti I. 155 says that the 14 vidyas ( enumerated in Yāj. I. 3) are comprehended in Trayi. Gaut. XI. 19 expressly says that in doing his duty of making the people observe the rules of the sacred codes the king would have to rely on the Veda, Dharmaśāstras, the Angas, Upavedas and Purāṇa. In the Rāmāyaṇa, Rāma and his brothers are often spoken of as proficient in the Vedas, Vedāngas, in Dhanurveda, Gandharvaveda, Rājavidya &c. (I. 18. 24 and 26, II. 1.20, II. 2. 34-35, V. 35. 13-14). In the Vanaparva 277. 4 it is said that the princes were proficient in the Vedas with their secret doctrine and in Dhanurveda. In the Adiparva 221. 72-74 Abhimanyu is said to have learned from Arjuna before he became 16 the Dhanurveda in four sections, the knowledge of astras, and the theory and practice of these. Vide also Anusagana 104. 146-147. Khāravela in his Hathigumpha Inscription (E. I. vol. XX. p. 79 11.2 and 5) states that he learnt Lekha (official correspondence), Rūpa (currency ), Ganana ( Accountancy) and the admini stration of justice, when he was the crown prince and also Gandharvaveda (music). In the Junagadh Inscription of Rudradaman (E. I. vol. VIII at page 44) the Mahaksatrapa is said to have attained great fame by his deep study, retention, and actual practice of grammar, artha ( either lexicography or politics ), music, logic and other vidyas and to have been a fine rider of horses, elephants, chariots and a great adept in wielding the sword and shield and in wrestling. The personal attain ments of Samudragupta (in Gupta Inscriptions No. 1 pp. 12, 15-16 ) show how thorough the education of at least some princos was or at least what the ideal about their education was.

(Vol. 

Prasad's Theory of Government in Ancient India' p. 218 for an ideal course of education for a prince quoted from the Buddhist work, Sūtrālankāra of Aśvaghoṣa. The Nitivakyāmsta" adds a long list of the accomplishments which a prince should possess viz, all scripts, valuing of jewels, knowledge of arms &c. On reading the ideal courses prescribed for the education of the prince by ancient Indian writers one cannot help feeling that they were probably actuated by the same sentiments that are attributed to Socrates by Plato in his ' Republic' (tr. by Jowett, ed. of 1875, vol. III. p. 357) viz. 'Until philosophers are kings or the kings and princes of this world have the spirit and power of philosophy and political greatness and wisdom meet in one and these commoner natures who follow either to the exclu sion of the other are compelled to stand aside, cities will never cease from ill-no, nor the human race as I believe-and then only will our State have a possibility of light and behold the light of day &o.' The Agnipurāṇa (225. 1-4) prescribes that the prince should be taught dharmaśāstra, kāmaśāstra, arthaśāstra, science of archery (dhanurveda ), the various arts and crafts by trusted teachers, that he should not be allowed to be associated with those who are angry with the king or disrespected by him or who are greedy and that if it is impossible to impart good qualities to him he should be confined, surrounded by pleasures. The princes were sometimes educated in their own capital or in a nearby college. Vide H. Dh. vol. II. p. 364. Sometimes, it appears, princes went to such famous seats of learning as Takṣasila (vide Jatakas ed. by Fausböll I. 87, 278, 319, 323, 400, III. 158, 168, 415, 463). The subjects of study there were the three vedas and 18 silpāni or vidyās (Jātakas, vol. II. 87, III. 115 ). Kautilya (1. 4) explains that Vārtā is constituted by agricul ture, the rearing of cattle and trade; it benefits ( the State) by bringing in grain, cattle, gold, baser metals, and free labour; by means of vārts the king secures treasury and army whereby he brings under control his own side and the enemy. In the Sabhaparva 6 5.79 and Ayodhyākānda 100. 47 it is declared

Importance of vārtā 

that when the world relies on vārtā it easily prospers. The Santi-parva ( 263.3) gives the warning that this world would cease to exist if vārtā was given up, that this world is rooted in vārtā and is sustained by the three vedas (68.35 ). The Vanaparva (150.30) states that the whole world is sustained by vārtā i.e. by merchandise, mines, trade, agriculture and tending cows, she-goats and ewes. The Nitivakyāmsta (p. 93 ) after defining vārtā es above emphasizes that the king secures the abundance of everything when vārtā is prosperous and that the man who has his own agriculture, milch-cattle, plot for growing vegetables and a well in his own house has indeed all the pleasures of this world. These quotations indicate what importance was attached to agriculture and the economic structure of society. The result is that in the Arthaśāstra economic matters occupy a very large space. 

Kautilya (1.5) starts by saying that the three vidyās (except daṇdaniti) in the case of the prince depend upon danda, that daṇda in its turn is based upon discipline, which is of two kinds, natural and induced (or acquired). Vidyās produce discipline (of the 2nd kind) in him who possesses the qualities of intellect specified above. Then he goes on to say that the prince should learn the alphabet and arithmetic after his caula is performed (in the 3rd year or later) and after upanayana ho should learn the three vedas and anvikṣikl from the sistas ( those learned in the veda), vārta from the heads or superin tendents ( of the various departments thereof) and dandanfti from expounders ( of the vidyā) and from practical politicians. Vide Manu VII. 43 ( =Matsya 215. 54 and Agni 225. 21-22 ) for directions as to from whom the prince was to learn the four vidyās. Kautilya prescribes that the prince should study these up to the 16th year, should then marry and that in order to foster the growth of the discipline of the intellect he should always associate with those who are advanced in the vidyās enumerated above (after his 16th year) and that the king should spend the first part of the day in practising the riding of elephants, horses, chariots and in the science of arms and the latter part of the day in listening to Itihasa which comprises Purana, history, stories, panegyrics, dharmasastra and artha śāstra. A king whose intellect is thus disciplined and who is devoted to disciplining his subjects also and to doing good to all will be the sole ruler of the earth. The Nitivākyāmsta (p. 162 ) defines vinaya as acting with humility towards those52

[Vol. 

who excel in vratas, vidyas and are aged.' Manu VII. 38-39. Kam. I. 19-20 and 59-63, Sukra I. 92-93 (taken from Kām. I. 19-20 ) extol the value and importance of vinaya and waiting upon the aged and the learned. Manu (VII. 40-42 ) states that many kings perished with their vast paraphernalia through want of digcipline while others, though residing in a forest (i.e. without an army &c.), gained kingdoms through vinaya, and names Vena, Nahusa, Sudās son of Pijavana and Sumukha Nimi as those who perished through lack of vinaya and gives Pșthu and Manu as examples of those who secured kingdoms through vinaya. Matsya 215,53 is the same as Manu VII. 40. Ancient Indian writers harp on the education of the prince so much because their ideal of kingship was that the king should be a rājar ṣi (a royal sage). Kalidasa frequently speaks of this e. g. in Śākuntala II. 14 and Raghuvansa (I. 58). They were aware, like Socrates, that until either philosophers became®4 kings or kings philosophers States will never succeed in remedying their short-comings ( vide p. 50 above). Not only was an extensive course of intellectual training prescribed for the king, but both dharmaśāstra and arthagāstra works strongly and frequently Insist upon the necessity of moral discipline and the right direct ion of the emotions and will in the case of the king. 

Kautilya (1.6) emphasizes that control of the organs of sense is the cause of (proficiency in) vidyās and discipline should be attempted by giving up the six enemical tendencies viz, lust, hot temper, greed, vanity (māna), haughtiness or insolence (mada ), overjoy. He says that (the whole purpose or insistence of ) all śāstras is the restraint of the senses, that even a supreme ruler of the whole earth up to its four borders whose senses are not under control will at once perish and cites two examples on each of these six tendencies, viz. Dāndakya Bhoja who attempted to rape a brāhmana girl through lust and perished with his kingdom and kinsmen and Karala king of Videha; Janamojaya (perished) who attacked brāhmaṇas through hot tempor and Tālajangha who did so against the Bhrgus; Aila who exacted through greed excessive taxes from poroons of the four varnas and Ajabindu, the king of Sauvira ; Ravana who did not restore another's wife through his conceit and Duryodhana who did not give even a part from his kingdom; Dambhodbhava who, despised all beings through his insolence and

Theso xix evil tendencies are called śatru-sad-varga or ari-sadvarga. Kautilya adds that by the conquest of these six evil tendencies Jāmadagnya (Parasurama) and Ambarisa enjoyed the earth for a long time. Kām. (I. 55 58) and Sukra. I. 144-146 give six of the twelve examples of Kaut, and Kām. I. 58 is the same as the last verse of Kautilya I. 6. Vide Mārkandeya 27. 12-13. In the Vasavadattā of Subandhu (Hall's od. pp. 273-276) there is a long list of the kings of antiquity (Purūravas, Nahusa, Yayāti, Sudyumna, Nala and nine others) who suffered owing to some failing or other in themselves. The Udyogaparva (74. 13-18) mentions by name 18 kings who by their evil career destroyed themselves, their friends and relatives (such as Mudāvarta of the Haihayas, Janamejaya of the Nipas, Bahula of Tālajanghas, Dhautamūlaka of the Cinas). This shows that Cina does not probably stand for modern China in the epic. Manu VII. 44 (=Matsya 215.55 ) also emphasizes the necessity for the king incessantly to curb the senges and not to fall a prey to vices arising from kāma and krodha. Manu (VII. 45-48) enumerates ten vicious tendencies due to kāma (desire for pleasures ) viz. hunting, gambling, sleep by day, finding fault (with others), women, drunkenness, (excessive indulgence in) dancing, singing and instrumental music, and aimless wandering; and eight vicious tendencies due to krodha (hot temper) viz. tale-bearing, violence, treachery, envy, slander, (improper) seizure of property, reviling and assault. Manu further declares (VII. 50) that among the vices due to kāma, drinking wine, gambling, women and hunting are the most harmful, each preceding one being worse than each succeeding

one and ( VII. 52) that among the vices due to hot temper, caus ing physical injury, reviling and deprivation of wealth are the worst. Manu (VII. 52) has a sly hit that these seven vices are more or less prevalent among kings (sarvatraivānuṣanginah) and therefore the only choice is that of the lesser or least of evils Kautilya (VII. 3) has a lengthy disquisition on the views of his predecessors about the relative harmfulness of the three vices due to hot temper and of the four due to kāma and states his own opinion that arthadūṣana meaning loss of the means of livelihood by gifts, exactions (by the king), loss or abandonment of pro perty is more harmful than reviling and dandapāruṣya is more harmful than arthadūṣana. He points out the benefits derived from hunting viz. exercise, the disappearance of phlegm, bile. fat and sweat, the acquisition of skill in aiming at stationary and moving bodies, the ascertainment of the minds of beasts when 

they are provoked and occasional travel.66 These are echoed, almost in the same words by Kām. XIV. 25 and in the Sakuntala (II. 25 ) by Kalidāsa. Vide Sabhā 68. 20, Udyoga 33.92 for the seven principal vices. Kām. (XIV. 6 and 7) enumerates the three vices of hot temper and the four of kama and holds an elaborate discussion on their respective demerits. He defines arthadūṣana (XIV, 17) somewhat differently (viz. as the aban doning of an important object or of great wealth in order to show that what really merits blame is not so). Vide the Viṣnudharmot tara II.65.12-15 for the two meanings of arthadūṣana67. Kām, does not agree that hunting has many good points in its favour and advises the king to prepare a separate well-guarded hunting ground of one-half yojana in length and breadth if he really desires to hunt ( XIV. 28-42). The Mānasollāsa (vol. II) in the 15th chapter of the 4th vimśati deals with hunting as a sport for kings and points out how a forest is to be preserved for royal hunting and how it is to be guarded and enumerates 31 methods of hunting. Kām, warns the king who wants to retain

He further says that a king may even indulge in fondness for women and may even drink moderately, but he must totally avoid gambling and hunting (XIV. 65). Kautilya regards gambling as the worst of the vices for a king (VIII. 3 last sentence in prose). In the Daśakumāracarita (VIII) there is an elaborate (but ironical) description of the mental and other benefits derived from the four principal vices due to kāma. Kām. I. 54 states that hunting, gambling and wine in the case of kings must be condemned, since calamities befell Pāndu, Nala and the Vrsnis (respectively ) by being addicted to these. Even an ideal king like Rama was fond of hunting. Sukra (I. 332-333) points out that hunting has much in its favour, but there is one great defect in it viz. slaughter of animals. Sukra (I. 109-119 ) denounces gambling, drinking and fondness for women as the worst of vices and points out that Indra, Dandakya, Nahuṣa and Rāvana came to grief through their passion for women (1. 114) and that a king who is excessively fond of dancers, singers, courtesans, wrestlers, eunuchs and men of low birth falls an easy prey to his enemies (I. 128 ). Kām. (I. 40-46, which are almost the same as Sukra I. 102-107) gives a poetic description of how animals like the deer, the elephant, the moth, the fish and the bee meet death or become confined by extreme attach ment to one only out of the five objects of sense and emphasizes that man who can and does enjoy all the pleasures of the five senses must practise great restraint. 

## 03 Duties of the Ruler

CHAPTER tft 

DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF 

THE RULER. 

All works are agreed that the first and foremost duty of the king is the protection of subjects. Sāntiparva (68.1-4) notes that all the seven expounders of polity (rājaśāstraprane tāraḥ) named by it extol protection as the highest dharma of the king. Manu VII. 144 states that the protection of subjects is the highest dharma and Kālidāsa in Raghuvamsa 14.67 alludes to this dictum of Manu. Protection consists in punishing internal aggression (such as by thieves and robbers and by persons who invade a man's rights ) and in meeting external 88 aggression. Vide quotation from Bphaspati below. Gautama (X. 7-8) prescribes that the special responsibility of the king is to protect all beings, to award just punishment and that he has to protect the several varnas and aśramas according to the rules of śāstra and to bring them round to the path of their proper duties when they swerve from it (XI. 9-10). Vasiṣtha ( 19. 1-2) states that the wise say that protection is a life-long sattra in which he has to give up fear and softness of heart. Vas. 19.7-8 and Viṣnu Dh. S. III. 2-3 are similar to Gaut. XI. 9-10. The Sāntiparva ( 23.15 ) repeats a gātha of Bphaspati. As a snake gwallows mice lying in holes, so the earth swallows these two viz, a king who does not fight (an invader) and a brāhmana who does not go on a journey (for acquiring knowledge from famous teachers ) 68a Manu IX. 306 states that the king pro tecting his subjects according to the śāstra and meting out punishment to those who deserve it performs every day sacrifices in which the fees are one hundred thousand cows (i.e. he secures the spiritual reward of very solemn sacrifices). Yāj. I. 335 is to the same effect. Kautilya also lays emphasis on the duty to keep the varṇas and aśramas to their duties 'Therefore the

Duties of the king 

king should not allow the people to swerve from their duties. He, who keeps dharma intact (without breach), enjoys bliss in this world and the next'. Nārada 59 (prakırnaka 33 ) states * His duty is to protect the subjects, to (honour or ) listen to the aged and the wise, to look into the disputes of people and to be energetio in his functions as king'. Sukra (I. 14 ) says that the highest dharma of the king is to protect the subjects and to put down the wicked. According to Atri (verge 28 ), 70 to punish the wicked, to honour the good, to increase the treasury in the right way, to deal impartially with litigants and to protect the kingdommthese five are declared to be sacrifices in the case of kings. The Vispudharmottara (III. 323, 25-26 ) refers to the five sacrifices in very similar words. In Santi 77. 33 the king's duty to restrain brāhmaṇas from engaging in unworthy actions is specially emphasized. These passages establish that the principal duties of the king were conceived to be to protect the subjects, to see that the rules of varnas and āśramas were carried out by them, to punish the wicked and to do justice. 

The duty to protect involved fighting and probable death. Therefore the ancient works on dharma-śāstra always insist that it is the duty of the kṣatriya to fight and that death on the battlefield is to be his highest ideal. Manu (VII. 87-89) enjoins upon the king, when protecting his subjects against invasion, not to run away from battle and promises heaven as the reward for kings who die fighting in battle. Yāj. I. 324 holds forth the game reward for all soldiers who are killed in battle. Vide Striparva 2.16 and 18 and 11. 8-9. The Bhagavadgitā (II. 31-37) most solemnly declares that there is nothing higher for a kaatriya than a righteous war, that a kṣatriya's duty requires him not to quail in battle, that if he dies in battle he goes to heaven and if he survives he rules over the world, that he should fight as a duty without caring for gain or loss, victory or defeat and if he fights with this attitude no sin attaches to him. Sānti. parva 78. 31 states that just as those who join in the bath of the king at the end of the Aśramedha are purified of all sins, so all

soldiers (of whatever caste and on whatever side ) killed in battle become pure by the destruction of their sins. Manu ( VII. 94-95) sets out the results for a soldier when he flees from the battlefield. Parāśara? III. 37 says “Two men pierce the orb of the sun (i. e. reach heavenly worlds) viz. an ascetic endowed with Yoga and a soldier killed while facing the enemy" and the following verses (III. 38 ff) dilate upon how the slain warrior is waited upon in heaven by divine damsels. A verse of the Rgveda X. 154, 3 ( Atharva 18. 2. 17) appears to hold that warriors losing life in battle reap the same rewards that those who make gifts of a thousand cows in sacrifices secure. It is probably this passage which Kautilya has in mind when in X. 3 he refers to the Voda for inciting the soldiers to fight without regard to life. Ap. Dh. S. (II. 10. 26. 2-3) states that a king, who strives to recover the wealth of brāhmanas (stolen by thieves) and dies in the effort, is said to perform a sacrifice, in which his body is the sacrificial post and the fees are incalculable and that other valiant men losing life in fighting for a (good) cause are in a similar position. To die fighting for the protection of cows and brāhmaṇag is specially commended (vide Santi 21. 19 and 77.28 and 30). The Visnudharmasūtra III. 44-46 prescribes there is no duty for kings equal to losing one's life in battle; those who meet death in protecting a cow, a brāhmana, a king, a friend, their own wealth and their wife enter heaven as also those who meet death 

in preventing confusion of varnas (caused by adultery &c.).' On the eye of battle the great warrior Bhiṣma says to his officers 

it is a sinful act for a ksatriya to die in his house from some disease; the ancient code of conduct for him is that he should meet death from steel' (Bhiṣmaparva 17. 11). The same idea is presented in Salyaparva 5. 32, Santi 97. 23 and 25. 

Kamandaka 78 (V. 82-83) makes it clear that the subjects require protection against the king's officers, thieves, enemies of the king, royal favourites (like the queen and the princes) and

the greed of the king himself. As an extension of the king's duty to protect, the works lay down that it is his duty to support students, learned brāhmanas, and sacrificers. 74 Vide Gaut. X. 9-12, XVIII. 31, Kaut. II. 1, Anuśāsana 61. 28-30, Santi 165. 6-7, Viṣnudharmasūtra III. 79-80, Manu VII. 82 and 134, Yāj. I 315 and 323 and III. 44, Matsya 215. 58, Atri 24. The Hindu kings of ancient and medieval India followed this advice with great liberality for centuries and the subject has already been treated in vol. II. pp. 113,856-864, The functions of Government were not supposed to end with the maintenance of peace and order, but Government must be an instrument of the diffusion of culture, The king is also called upon to support helpless and aged people, the blind, the cripple, lunatics, widows, orphans, those suffering from diseases and calamities, pregnant women by giving them medi cines, lodging, food and clothing according to their requirements?s. Vide Vas. 19.35-36, Viṣnudharmasūtra III. 65, Matsya 215. 62, Agni 225. 25, Adiparva 49, 11, Sabhā 18. 24, Virātaparva 18. 24, Santi 77. 18. The Rājaniti-prakāśa (pp. 130-131 ) quotes the Viṣnudharmottara requiring the king to honour and protect chaste women (pativratās) and Saṅkha-Likhita to the effect that even kṣatriyas and vaiśyas who cannot maintain themselves by the methods prescribed by the śāstras for them should approach the king who should help them with the means of livelihood and they should work for the king in the manner laid down for them and that sūdras also should apply their skill and crafts for the benefit of the king when so maintained." Medhātithi on Manu V. 94 states that when a king supports his subjects in a famine by distributing food from his treasury no question of his being in mourning would come in the way. These provisions for the old, the blind, the widows, orphans and helpless persons and for the relief of unemployed kṣatriyas, vaiśyas and sūdras strike one as

rather modern in tone. In many modern countries the State has become the means of providing services for the greater part of its subjects, not only armed forces and the police, but social services such as education, public health, medical attendance, insurance against unemployment, old age, widowhood, and orphanage, relief of poverty &o. In ancient India, though there were naturally no Acts of Parliament guaranteeing the above services to the subjects, public opinion, the views of eminent writers and the practice of the best kings created an atmosphere in which it was thought that it was imperative for the king representing the State and its resources to encourage learning, to care for the blind, the decrepit, the old and the widowed and to give employment to those who were unemployed. Asoka constructed hospitals for men and animals (2nd Rock Edict at Kalsi in C. I. I. vol. 1, p. 28), alms-houses, rest houses, watering places, shady trees on the highways and irrigation works, visited and supported the aged (8th Girnar Rock Edict in C. I I. p. 15). In the 2nd century B.C. Khāravela, emperor of Kalinga, declares in his Hāthigumpha Inscription (E. I. vol. XX p. 71 at p. 86) that in the very first year of his reign he constructed embankments round the Khibfra lake in the Kalinga capital and renovated all public gardens. Rudradāman in the 2nd century A. D. repaired the Sudarsana lake at great cost from his own treasury without levying fresh taxes or benevolences (pranaya) or forced labour. The Anuśāsanaparva says that good kings should construct meeting halls, prapās, tanks, temples and lodging places for brāhmaṇas. The Matsyapurāna 215. 64 remarks that the king should give to those who stay in hermitages food, oil and pots. Vide Ap. Dh. 8. II. 2. 4. 21 and Haradatta thereon as to provision for śūdra guests. It is quite possible that these rules of the texts were not literally followed by all kings, but it is well-known how even legislative enactments are carried out by the subordi nato staff in all countries including those of the West. One has only to turn to Dickens''Oliver Twist' for some indication of the administration of Poor Laws and work-houses in England about a hundred years ago.

detailed rules, which have been already set out (H. of Dh. vol. II pp. 805-806). Every day on rising from his bed the king was advised (by Manu VII. 37) to wait upon brāhmaṇas learned in the three Vedas and endowed with wisdom and to abide by their directions. Vas. I. 39-41, Gaut. XI. 13-14 say the same. In giving this advice exaggerated claims were made for brāhmaṇas which have been already set out before. Vide H. Dh, vol. II pp. 135-136 and Anusāsana 33. 2-8. The king was also expected to show himself to all people every day (Ayodhyā 100. 51, Sabhā 5.90)", 

An extremely high ideal was placed before the king by the Kautilsya, the Mahābhārata and other works. In the Artha sāstra I. 19 Kautilya 80 proclaims the magnificent ideal 'in the happiness of the subjects lies the happiness of the king, in their welfare lies his welfare; the good of the king does not consist in what is pleasing to himself, but what is pleasing to the subjects constitutes his good'. Similar words occur in the Visnudharmasūtra III. last verse. 81 The Mahābhārata (Śānti 69. 72-73) purports to quote two verses of Angiras (i.e. Bphaspati), one of which says ' of what use is tapas to that king or of what use are oven sacrifices to him who has well looked after his subjects? He is surely one who knows all dharmas.' Kautilya compares the king to the performer of a sacrifice, in which his vrata 8( in the case of the sacrificer observances about food, scratching the body &c.) consists in being ever active, the sacrifice consists in issuing orders for carrying out the business ( of the State), the sacrificial fee (that the king pays) is his

Sāntiparva 83 ( 56. 44 and 46 ) and Nitiprakāśika VIII. 2 declare that a king like a pregnant woman should not do what is pleasing to him, but what would conduce to the good of the people and the ancient dharma for a king is to keep the subjects contented. In śānti 90. 1 and 5 it is said the king is there for the upholding of dharma and not for acting as he likes and that all beings have to depend on dharma which in its turn depends on the king'. In Udyogaparva 118. 13-14 a king exclaims the wealth I possess is for the benefit of the urban and rural population and not for ny own enjoyment; for, that king who at his sweet will gives away what ( really is not his but) belongs to others does not become endowed with spiritual merit nor with fame'. King Marutta is warned by his grand-mother in the Mārkandeya 84 ( 130. 33–34 ) that the king's body is not meant for pleasures but for undergoing great trouble in protec ting the earth and carrying out his duties. Ancient writers loved to dwell upon the rule of the king as paternal. Kaut, II. 1 states that the king should favour like a father those who are outside the rules for remission of taxes. Yāj. J. 334 requires the king to be like a father to his subjects and servants. Vide Sānti 139, 104-105 for the same idea. 85 In the Rāmāyaṇa II. 2. 28-47 and V. 35. 9-14 the virtues of the prince Rāma are set out in great detail, where it is said that Rāma behaved like a father (II. 2. 39), that he sympathized with the people in their sorrows and was pleased like a father when the subjects celebrated festivals.

In the Harṣa carita (V) the dying king Prabhākaravardhana consoles his young and favourite son Harsa by exhorting him to reflect over the idea that kings are to be deemed to have relatives in their subjects and not merely in agnates. 86a Asoka also in his Edicts harps on the paternal relation all men are my children' (the first separate Jaugadh Edict, C. I I. vol I pp. 111 and 114). 

There were, it appears, several grades of rulers from the most ancient times. The word rūjan occurs in numerous places in the Rgveda. It is applied to such gods as Mitra and Varupa (Rg. VII. 64. 2), Varuṇa (Rg. I. 24. 12 and 13, X. 173. 5). It appears to be used in two senses, viz. (1) ' king' as in Rg. I. 65. 7, II. 43. 5 ( 'will you make me the protector of people, the king, O Indra '), 1V. 4.1, IX. 7.5, X. 174. 4) and (2) noble' as in Rg. IX. 10.3, X. 78. 1, X. 97.6 ( where the plants come together as nobles in an assembly' rūjānaḥ samitūviva). In Rg. VIII. 21. 18 it is said 87 Citra who gave thousands and ten thousands is the only king, others are only small chiefs along the bank of the Sarasvati'. The word 'samrāj' is known to the Rgveda and is used as an epithet of Varuṇa (in Rg. VI. 68.9) and of Indra ( in Rg. VIII. 16.1 ) and the word sāṁrājya also occurs in relation to Varuṇa in Rg. I. 25. 10. In Rg. VIII. 37.3 Indra is said to be sole ruler of the world ( ekarāt). It is not un likely therefore that the idea of an emperor who had suze rainty over several kings was known, though it is possible that in Rg. VIII. 37. 3 the word is used only in a metaphorical sense. In Rg. VII. 83. 7-8 $7a it is said that ten kings though they formed a confederacy could not vanquish king Sudās and that in the ten kings' battle ( dāśarājie ) Indra and Varuṇa helped Sudās who was surrounded by them on all sides. A very large number of kings is mentioned by name in numerous places in the Rgveda (e. g. I. 53. 8 and 10, I. 54. 6, I. 100, 17, VII. 33, 2, VIII. 3. 12, VIII. 4. 2). Besides these it appears that there were

tribal chiefs or governments of such clans or tribes as the Anus, Druhyus, Turvaśas, Pūrus, Yadus (Rg. I. 108. 8, all in the plural, VII 18. 6 and VIII. 6. 46). But sometimes these words are used in the singular, when they mean'a king or chief of that clan'. Vide Rg. VIIL 4.7, VIII. 10.5, IV. 30. 17. In the Atharvaveda III. 4. 1 (may you shine forth as the sole ruler of men) that word (ekarāt) is used in its literal sense and in Atharva VI.98.1 (may87) Indra conquer and may he never be defeated, may he shine as the overlord among kings) the idea of an emperor (adhirāja) is clearly set forth. In Rg. X. 128. 988 the word 'adhi rāja' must be taken in the same sense. The Atharvaveda speaks of an Ugra which word seems to mean a formidable king (or emperor) 'Then you chase away disease as a formidable ( king ) who is in the midst (of many kings presses hard each of them)' IV.9. 4. In the Atharvaveda III. 4. 3 it is said 'May the ugra Bee a lot of tribute'. In Rg. X. 34. 8 the word ugra has probably the same sense viz. 'a formidable king'. In the Tai. S. 11. 6. 2. 2 it is said that men are held (supported or restrained) by the king ( tasmād rājñā manusyā vidhștāḥ). In the Tai. S.

Grades of sovereignty 

relation to sovereignty over people are not clear. They are probably hyperbolical and grandiloquent words to convey sup reme power. Even a brāhmaṇa, according to vedic texts, may perform the Vājapeya if he desires 'svārājya 'which means super eminence. Parameṣthin means ' Prajāpati'and so pāramesthya simply means godlike power. Further there is no apparent reason why, after rising high from sāmrajya to pārameṣthya' there should be a descent to mere 'rājya' and ' māhārājya'. Sayaṇa" takes rājya' and 'māhārājya' at the end of the passage as referring to the position of the king in the next world. This is rather far-fetched. Jayaswal (in “Hindu Polity', part 1 pp. 89-90 and p. 133 ) takes these words to mean 'the Bhaujya constitution &c.' relying on the occurrence of the Bhojas in Asoka's Rock Edicts V and XIII and in Khāra vela's Inscription, on the appearance of Bhojas as rulers in Western India and the town of Bhuj in Cutch and 'vairājya' as kingless system and 'svārājya' as 'self-ruling system'; but this is all unwarranted and is a fair sample of the way in which some of Jayaswal's theories are built up. It passes one's understanding how a paramount sovereign is promised vairājya (in Jayaswal's sense ) in the Ait. Br. In the Rgveda (V. 66. 6 ) we have the word 'svarājya' (which probably means the same thing as * svārājya') in 'Let us strive for an all-embracing sovereignty, which will afford protection to many '98 In the Satapatha Brāhmana the distinction between a king (rājan) and an emperor is very clearly expressed as follows: "For, by offering the Rājasūya he becomes king and by the Vājapeya he becomes emperor; and the office of king is the lower and that of emperor higher' (V. 1. 1. 13). Satapatha IX. 3. 4. 8 contains the same idea again. In Satapatha I. 6. 4. 21 it is said 'before the slaying of Vftra he was Indra, it is true; but after slaying Vitra he became Mahendra, even as a king (rājan) becomes a mahārāja after obtaining victory'. These passages are sufficient to establish that the idea of a suzerainty extending over many kingdoms was known in the times of the Rgveda and had been fully developed before the composition of the Aitareya and Satapatha Brahmanas.

(Vol. 

The Aitareya Brāhmaṇa mentions by name twelve emperors' of ancient India and the Satapatha thirteen (XIII. 5. 4. 1-19 ). Panini explains (V. 1. 41-42) 'sārva-bhauma' as 'the lord of the whole earth'. The Amarakosa states that the words "rāi', * pārthiva', 'kṣmābhft', 'nṣpa', 'bhūpa' and 'mahiksit' are synonyms and mean “king', that a king before whom all feudatories humble themselves is styled 'adhiśvara', 'cakravartin', 

sārvabhauma ' i. e. these three last words are synonyms. The word 'cakravartin' is derived" by Kṣirasvāmin as one who wields lordship over a circle of kings' or who makes the circle (i. e. kingdom ) abide by his orders'. The word 'cakravartin', though not so ancient as 'sārvabhauma', has been employed from very ancient times. The Maitri Upanigad 1. 4 mentions 15 cakra varting. The Rājanitiprakāśa (p. 58 ) quotesos a passage from the Samavidhāna Brāhmaṇa ( III. 5. 2) 'the priest should perform the coronation with the Ekavrṣa Sāman for that king whom he desires to be the sole ruler and whose circle of territory (he does not desire ) to be overwhelmed ( by an enemy )'. Here probably is one of the earliest references to the derivation of the word cakravartin. In the Mahāvagga (Selasutta, 8. B. E, vol. X p. 102 ) Lord Buddha is made to say "I am a king, an incomparable, religious king ( dharmarāja ); with justice (dhammena) I turn the wheel, a wheel that is irresistible'. Here the idea of the secular cakravartin is carried into the moral and spiritual sphere. In the Nānāghāt Inscription (of about 200 B. C.) occurs the word 

apratihatacakasa' (i. e-cakrasya). Vide ASWI, vol. V. p. 50 at p.60. Khāravela is styled Kalinga-cakravartin in the Mañchapuri record of his chief queen (E. I. vol. XX p. 86n), supavatavijaya caka' (supravșttavijaya-cakra, in l. 14 ) and pavata-caka' (pravstta-cakra in l. 17 ) of his Hāthigumpha Inscription (E. I. vol. XX at pp. 88–89). Kautilya (IX. 1) defines the land of the cakravartino as the territory on the earth spreading towards the

north from the sea to the Himalaya, which is a thousand yojanas in extent when measured in & straight line. The same idea occurs in the Kāvyamimāmsā of Rajasekhara (p. 92). Kautilya also employs the expression 'cāturanto rājā' (a king of the earth up to its four boundaries ). Sānti-parya 97 speaks of a ruler who brings the whole earth under one umbrella. On the birth of Harsa, the chief astrologer told his father Prabhākaravardhana that the boy would be the leader of the seven cakravartins (Harṣacarita IV). In some works the six cakravartins are said to be Māndhātā, Dhundhumāra, Hariscandra, Purūravas, Bharata, Kārtavirya. The Sabhāparva (15. 15-16 ) mentions five emperors of old viz. Yauvanāśva ( Māndhātā ), Bhagiratha, Kārtavirya, Bharata and Marutta. Vide Dr. N. N. Law's ' Aspects of Ancient Indian Polity' pp. 17-21 for exhaustive lists of ancient emperors, from the Mahābhārata, the Satapatha Brāhmana and other works. This ideal of cakravartin was set before them by all ambitious and energetic Indian rulers from ancient times. The result was that constant wars took place. We have a galaxy of historical emperors that emulated such mythical heroes and emperors as Māndhātā and Bharata and practically realized the ideal. To name only a few, Candragupta, Asoka, Puṣyamitra, Bhavanāga of the Bhāraśivas, Pravarasena Vākātaka, Samudragupta and Harga are great names in our ancient history. Even if this ideal of universal empire had not been there, wars could not have been avoided. That was a very usual thing everywhere in the ancient world. Only about 700 years ago, Britain, which is a very small country compared to India, had three kingdoms engaged in constant warfare. 

The Matsya-purāna (114. 9-10 ) first gives the dimensions of Bharata Varșa from South to North (from Cape Comorin to the source of the Ganges) as one thousand yojanas, states that its extent is ten thousand yojanas ( when measured upwards across the boundaries ) and that on all borders of it there are Mlecchas and that Yavanas and Kiratas dwell to its east and west (verse 11 ) and that the king who conquers the whole of Bharatavarsa is styled 'samrāt' (verse 15 ). Vide Brahmapurāṇa 17. 8 ff for almost the same words. The Sukranitisāra (I. 183-187) states that a sāmanta is one whose yearly revenue is from 1 to 3 lakhs of silver karṣas without oppressing the people, the revenue of a māndalika is from 4 to 10 lakhs, that of a rājan is from 11 to 20

lakhs, of a mahārāja from 21 to 50 lakhs, of a syarat from 51 lakhs to a crore, of a virāṭ from two crores to ten, of the sārva bhauma (who wields suzerainty over the whole earth i. e. Bharatavarṣa ) from 11 crores to 50. Though these definitions may be regarded as scholastic and too rigid to have been praotically followed they do convey a sufficiently clear idea about the power of a feudatory, a king and an emperor. The Sabhāparva. * ( 15.2 ) says there are kings in each house, who do what pleases them; but they do not reach the position of emperor, which title can be acquired with great difficulty', and 'that king under whose sole dominion the world abides secures the position of sairāj' In these and other places 'world'means 'Bharatayarṣa'for which see H. Dh. vol. II pp. 17-18. Sovereignty (sāṁrājya) consisted in ancient India not necessarily or invariably in acquiring con trol over vassal kings in all their affairs. Generally the supreme ruler did not hanker after territory so much as after having his superior prowess acknowledged. The descriptions of digvijayas (world conquests) in the Mahābhārata (e. g. of Pandu in Adi 113, of Arjuna and the other Pandava brothers in Sabha, chap, 26-32) show that there was no aggrandizement by acquiring fresh territory but all that was desired was to make the several kings submit and pay tribute or offer presents. Arjuna expressly says in Sabhā 25.3 that he would bring tribute from all kings and the conquered kings are generally represented as submitting and making presents of gems, golds, horses, cows to the conqueror. The Allahabad stone pillaro9 Inscription of Samudragupta (Gupta Ing. p. 8) states that the pratyanta (bordering) kings of Samatata and other countries and the Mālava and other tribal oligarchies fully gratified Samudra gupta's coñmands by giving all tribute, by obeying his orders and by coming to perform obeisance. Sānti 96 insists that conquests should be made according to dharma. Empire did not mean imposition of the language or the government system of the conqueror on the conquered country. The conqueror's duty as understood by ancient Indian works was quite different

Gauda ant when he started 

as will be presently shown, Kautilya (XII. 1) declares log that there are three kinds of invaders, viz, dharmavijayin (who is Matisfied with mere submission or obeisance), lobhavijayin ( who is satisfied with gain in land and money), asuravijayin ( who is not satisfied with land and money only but robs the defeated king of his son, wife and life). The Nitivākyāmsta (pp. 362-363, Yuddhasamuddeśa) defines the three almost in the same words. This shows that in the first two kinds of conquests the conquered state retained its own institutions, organization and government intact. Bāna gives 101 in very striking language what Harga proclaimed when he started against the treacherous king of Gauda and on digvijaya. It appears that even the queens of vanquished chiefs had to perform the duties of maids at the time of the coronation of the emperor and empress, as queen Yaśomati says to Harsa (in Harṣacarita V). Vide Sabhā 31. 73-74 where Bibhisana is said to have come with presents to Sahadeva. Asoka (in Kalsi Edict No. XIII in C. I. I. I, pp. 44 and 46, ed. by Hultzsch) speaks of his conquest being dharma vijaya. This means that he foreswore greed and cruelty and wanted that his influence be only acknowledged. The Pallava king Sivaskandavarman (of Kāñci) who had performed the Agnistoma, Vājapeya and Aśvamedha sacrifices calls himself dhamma-mahārājādhirāja (a dharma-vijayı emperor) in E. I. vol. I. p. 5. In the Dudia plate of Pravarasena II, Pșthvigena is styled dharma-vijayin (E. I. vol. III p. 258 at p. 261). Samudra gupta's conquest of South India seems to have been only a dharmavijaya. As time went on the titles of kings grew in grandiloquenoe. Asoka whose empire extended at least from Afganistan to the Bay of Bengal and included some part of the Deccan and Mysore calls himself 'rājo'. Khāravela is styled only mahārāja and Kalingadhipati in the Hāthigumpha Inscription,

(Vol. 

Huviska, the Kuṣaṇa emperor, is styled Mahārāja rājātirāja devaputra ( E. I. vol. I. pp. 371, 386). Samudragupta is simply mahārāja (Gupta Inscriptions p. 8). But later emparors styled themselves paramabhattāraka-mahārājādhiraja (Gupta Inscrip tions p. 70, Indore copperplate of Skandagupta of Gupta year 146 i. e. 465-66 A, D.) or sometimes 'parama-bhattāraka-maha rājādhirāja-parameśvara' (Gupta Inscriptions No. 39, p. 176 copperplate of the Valabhi king Silāditya in 447 of the Valabhi era i. e. 766-67 A. D.). Ancient works are not very particular about the epithets they employ when speaking of a king or an emperor. Śānti (68.54) says that a king is praised with the epithets rājan, bhoja, virāt, samrāt, ksatriya, bhūpati and nṛpa. 108 Dasaratha is styled rājā in Ayodhyā 2.2. and mahā rāja in 18.15 and 57.32. The Rājanitiratnākara (pp. 3-4) holds that kings are of three kinds; viz. emperor (samrāt), one who pays tribute and one who does not pay even tribute (but is not a samrāt), quotes several verses from a work of Nārada on politics and states that the words cakravartin, samrāt, adhisvara and mahārāja are synonyms. Kings aspiring to be called samrāt performed the Rājasūya and Aśvamedha in ancient India. The Sabhāparva 13,30 speaks of Rājasūya as fit to be performed by a samrāṭ. Senāpati Puṣyamitra (about 180 B. C.) is said to have performed two Aśyamedhas (vide E. I. vol. XX p. 54, 57). The Ghosundi Inscription (E. I. vol. 16 p. 25 and E. I. vol. 22 p. 198) speaks of Sarvatāta, a great devotee of Viṣnu, as a performer of Aśvamedha. Khārayola (who was a Jain) performed Rājagūya (E. I. vol. XX at p. 79). The Vākāṭaka king Pravarasena I had performed four Aśvamedhas (E. I. vol. III. p. 258 and Gupta Inscriptions No. 55). In the Vākātaka copperplatea the Bhāraśivas are extolled as having performed ton Aśvamedhas (E. I. III. 258 at p. 260). The Sālankāyana king Vijayadevavarma, whose capital was at Vengi in Andhra, is said to have performed an Aśramedha (E. I. IX. p. 56, about 350 A. D). The Cālukya king Pulakesin I had performed Aśva medha (E. I. vol. VI p. 1 and IX. p. 100) about 550 A. D. Puṣya mitra is styled simply Senapati in the Malavikāgnimitra Act V when he sends a message to his son about attending the Rajasūya in which he had been engaged. For the significance of the Abhi gecaniya rite in Rājasūya vide H. of Dh. vol. II pp. 1216-1218. The Kadambas are said to have performed Aśvamedhas in the Nilambur plates (E. I. vol. VIII p. 148). The Viṣnukundin

The conqueror's duties 

Mahārāja Madhavavarman performed eleven Advamedhas and one thousand Agnistomas (I. H. Q. Vol. IX p. 278). Vide H. Dh. vol. II pages 1238-1239 for a few more historic examples of the performers of Aśvamedha. 

Kautilya (VII 16 ) prescribes that the conqueror should not covet the territory, wealth, sons and wives of the slain (in battle), that he should re-instate the late king's kinsmen in their proper places (or positions ), that he should instal the son of the deceased king on the throne of his father and adds that the emperor who kills or imprisons the kings that submit and covets their lands, wealth, sons or wives provokes the mandala (the circle of States ) and makes it rise against himself. Yājñavalkya (I. 342-43 ) prescribes that it is the duty of the conqueror to protect the conquered country in the same way as his own country and the conqueror is to respect the customs of the con quered country, its laws and the usages of the families therein. 

The Visnudharmagūtra 108 ( ILI. 42 and 47-49 ) enjoins upon the conqueror not to uproot the usages of the conquered country, to establish in its capital some kinsman ( of the slain king) and not to destroy the royal family unless it be of low birth. Manu ( VII. 202-203) and Agnipurāṇa 23622 prescribe similar rules. The Rāmāyaṇa (VII. 62:18-19) requires the conqueror, after uprooting the king, to establigh another king there in order to ensure stable government. Vide Sānti 33-43-46 quoted above on p. 40. Katyāyana (q. in the Rājanitiprakāśa p. 411) prescribes that even when the (vanquished) king is at fault, the conqueror should not ruin the country (for the fault of the vanquished king ), since he (the vanquished king ) did not start (on his career of) wrong-doing with the consent of his subjects. The Rājanitiprakāśa draws from this the conclusion that the ministers with whose consent the war was started may be harassed by the conqueror. This advice was generally followed by ancient conquerors and emperors. Rudradāman (150 A. D.) is styled the establisher of kings that had lost their territories (in the Junagadh Ins., E. I. vol. VIII at p. 44) and in the Allahabad Stone Pillar Inscription of Samudragupta it is said that his fame travelled over the whole world because of his

( Vol. having re-established several royal families that had lost their kingdoms (Gupta Inscriptions, p. 8). The Sukranitisāra (IV. 7-397-399 ) requires the conqueror to support the well-behaved son and the queen of the vanquished king or to give a fourth of the conquered kingdom to him and only go part of it to one who is not endowed with good qualities and the conqueror may appropriate the whole treasury of the conquered. 

The coronation of a king was a very solemn and important ceremony. Reasons of space forbid any lengthy treatment but something must be said about it. In the medieval text-books, various procedures are described from different sources. The Rājanitiprakasa (pp. 42-112 ), the Niti-mayūkha (pp. 1-13) and the Rājadharmakaustubha (pp. 237-374), the Rāja. Dh. K. (II. pp. 6-10 ) quote procedures of coronation from the Ait. Br., the Gopatha Br., the Sāmavidhana Br., the Brahmapurana, the Viṣnudharmottara and other works. The procedure from the Purānas probably originated when persons of the sūdra caste frequently became kings. The Rājanitiprakāśa 10+ (p. 112 ) says that there being different procedures of coronation rites based on Vedic texts, some hold, following the dictum of Sabara (on Jaimini II. 4.9 ), that the coronation rite should comprehend all the different items mentioned in the several vedic texts (provided they do not contradict each other), while others hold that there should be no comprehensive inclusion of all items but each vedic or smṛti procedure should be followed separately by itself. Mitra misra concludes that the purohita should follow that course which is nearest to his own sākhā. The Rājadharmakaustubha (p. 339 ) says that as the rite described in the Viṣnudharmottara contains the largest number of details, one who is able to do so, may follow that Purāna, while for those who cannot do so there is an option or students of the Rgveda may follow the Rgvidhāna mode, of the Sāmaveda the Sāmavidhāna Br. and all may follow the Purāṇa mode of coronation. I shall first briefly indicate what procedure was followed in some vedic texts such as the Gopatha Brāhmaṇa, the Samavidhāna Br. and in the Gșhyasūtras, then point out what was done in the times of the

epios and set out the prominent items in the procedure of the purānas. 

The Aitareya Brālımana ( 38 ) describes the Great Corona tion of Indra (Aindra mihābhiṣeku) and in that connection mentions how the kings of the Sātvatas in the south were called 'Bhoja' after coronation, the kings of the eastern countries were called 'samrāt', the kings in the west were called 'svarāt' and the kings of the north i, e. of countries beyond the Himalaya (viz. Uttarakurus and Uttaramadras ) were called 'virāt'. Then (in 39 ) it states that the ksatriya king is to be made to take an oath and is to be crowned in the manner of the Aindra Maha bhiṣeka 15. The oath which the ksatriya is to take before the priest with faith is : 'the merit of sacrifices and good works that belongs to me from the night I was born up to the night on which I shall die, my worlds, good deeds, life, progeny,--these you may destroy if I hate ( or prove false to ) thee'. Vide note 41 above for the coronation oath in Sānti 59.106 ff. It will be noticed that this passage of the Ait. Br. contains no undertaking given by the king to the people to rule according to dharma or for their welfare. So this passage cannot strictly be interpreted as postula ting a contractual basis for the authority or power of the king, as done by Jayaswal( 'in Hindu Polity' part II p. 28). The Ait. Br, sets out the materials ( sambhāras ) for the coronation of a king (in chap. 39.2 ) viz. fruits of nyagrodha, udumbara, aśvattha and plakṣa trees, grains of small rice, large-sized rice, priyangu and barley, a couch of udumbara with span-long feet, a spoon with a four-cornered scooped bazin of udumbara and an udumbara vessel, on one of which two the other materials were to be placed and curds, honey, clarified butter and rain water gathered when the sun is shining. The mantras to be recited are mentioned in 39-3-4 and the fee in 39-6. In the Rājasūya (to be performed only by a ksatriya) described in the Brah manas and sūtras, the principal rite is the Abhiṣecaniya in which the king is bathed with waters brought from seventeen sources in seventeen vessels of udumbara wood. Vide H. Dh. vol. II. pp. 1216-1218 for the rito. The Rājanitiprakāśa (p. 92 107) explains the procedure of coronation from the Ait. Br. In the Rājasūya, among the preliminary rites are the offerings

called ratninām havimṣi' (the offerings in the houses of the jewels, which are twelve). Vide H. Dh. vol. II pp. 1215-16. They have a symbolical value. The person to be crowned re cognizes the importance of his high functionaries and is declared to be their king and they are supposed to approve of him as king. In the Abhiṣecaniya rite of the Rajasūya, there are two parts, a religious and a popular. First, the adhvaryu and tho other priests sprinkle the king with holy water collected from various sources in vessels; then the king's brother, a friendly ksatriya and a vaisya also sprinkle him with the holy water. This last is symbolio of the popular approval of the coronation, 

The Tai. Br. II. 7. 15–17 deals with coronation. It first gives the seven mantras for seven ahutis that are offered. A tiger skin is spread on which the king is seated and he is sprinkled with holy water in which sprouts of barley and dūrvā grans are mixed up; the king ascends a chariot to the accom paniment of mantras, then the four wheels of the chariot are touched, the purohita and charioteer are addressed with man tras%3D Anumati, the Earth (as mother), and Heaven (as father) are implored to approve of the coronation, the king is made to look up towards the Sun and then the king looks on the sub jects; the king then undergoes shaving when seated on a chair of udumbara wood, then his arms and head are anointed with milk blended with clarified butter. 

The Nitimayakha. pp. 4-5, Rajanitiprakāsa pp. 42-43, Rajadharmakaustubha pp. 335-336 quote a passage from the Gopatha Brāhmaṇa 106 on the rites of coronation as follows: We shall expound the rite of the coronation of the king. Having

collected the materials required such as bilya fruit, viz. sixteen jars, sixteen bilva fruits, earth from an ant-hill, all kinds of husked grains, all liquids, and all kinds of grains (unhusked ). There should be four jars each of gold, silver, copper and clay. Having filled them, keeping their mouths up, with water from a deep reservoir of water or a lake to the accompaniment of the mantra "nāmaināma'(?) and having put the jars down on the surface of the altar, he ( the priest) should place one bilva fruit apiece in each of the 16 jars and cast (into the jars) the husked and unhusked grains and all fluids, adding them (to the water) in the golden jars with the mantras called Abhaya (Atharva veda 19.15), Aparajita, Āyuṣya (Atharvaveda I. 30) and Svas tyayana 109 ( Atharvaveda I. 21, VII. 85. 1, VII. 86. 1, VII. 117.1), in the silver jars, with the mantras called samsrāvya (Atharva veda 19.1) and Samsiktiya (Atharyaveda II. 26), in the copper jars with the mantras called Bhaiṣajya (Atharva VII. 45' janad') and Amhomuc and in the earthen jars with Samveśa, Sam. vargya and Santātiya mantras and with the Prāna hymn (Atharvaveda XI. 4). He should then bathe the king with (the water of) the jars held by very holy and learned brāh maṇas (śrotriyas). He should consecrate the king seated on the throne with the mantra (Atharvaveda IV. 22.1) 'O Indra, make this my ksatriya prosper'. (The king) being thus bathed should eat the several liquids, should make gifts of a thousand cows to the brahmana priests who assist the chief priest, bestow a good village on the chief priest. He (the king) thereby acquires great glory, enjoys the earth and always vanquishes his foes'.

The Sanayidhāna Brāhmaṇa 108 (III. 5) describes a shorter rite; "(The priest) should crown the king when the moon is in the Pusya or Sravana constellation. Having brought waters (separately in separate jars ) from famous holy rivers (like the Ganges) 109 and from the sea and having mixed in them rice, barley, sesame and māsa (black beans) grains and curds, honey, flowers and gold, he should bathe the king seated on an auspici ous throne made of udumbara wood on which is spread tiger-skin with the hair outside, from horn-pipes cut off from the horns of living cows to the accompaniment of the rahasya mantra 'abhrātsvyaḥ' (you are without an enemy &c., Rg. VIII. 21.13, Sāmaveda 399 and 1489). He should bathe the king to the accompaniment of the Ekavṣṣa hynin (instead of Rg. VIII. 21.13) whom he desires to be the sole ruler (of the earth) and whose circle of kings is desired by hiin not to be overwhelmed by an enemy. On the priest performing the coronation rite the king should bestow the best village, a hundred maid servants and a thousand cows and (the king) should be obedient to him (the officiating priest)". 

The Baud. Gșhyaśeṣasūtra (I. 23) contains the procedure of coronation, the whole of which is quoted by the Balambhatti on the Mitākṣarā on Yāj. I. 309. It is briefly as follows:On the 5th or 13th tithi of the bright half when the moon is in Pusya or Sravana or in any other auspicious constellation ( nakṣaıtra), two "brāhmaṇas are fed (the day previous). Then a worthy purohita is chosen, who mutters certain texts. At sunset the purohita makes a lotus-like circle in which are collected the materials viz. waters of the ocean and of rivers mixed with rice, barley, sesame, māsas and pañcagavya, and a bhadrūsana made of udumbara, a tiger-skin, and golden jars and horns of cows. In the north-east part of the palace, a homa is performed with eight thousand āhutis (oblations) of rice &c. to the accompani ment of the vyāhrtis, the Gāyatri and the mantra to Tryambaka

Coronation according to Baudhūyana 

(Tai. S. I. 8. 6. 2). The priest first propitiates the goddess Lakṣmi with the hymn to Sri and then washes the crown with cow's urine and dung, milk, curds, clarified butter and with water mixed with kuśas to the accompaniment of appropriate mantras, and ties an amulet (pratisara), and sprinkles the king and his conveyance (horse ). At sunrise next day (the day of coronation) the tiger-skin is spread on the throne, the king sits thereon facing the east, the priest takes the golden jars and sprinkles the king with water falling upon him from the cone like horns of cows with several mantras (such as those addressed to waters, Varuṇa &c.). After the king is made to take a bath, a fee of a thousand niṣkus and a hundred dūsis is paid to the brāhmaṇas. Then the crown is placed on his head and drums are beaten. 

The Kausikagātra of the Atharvaveda (in 17.1-10) des cribes the abhiṣeka ( called laghu ) performed on the Yuvarāja, Māndalika, Samanta and Senāpati and (in 17.11-34 ) describes the mahābhiseka of the king, 

In the Rāmāyana there are numerous references to corona tion. In the Yuddhakanda 131 we have a lengthy description of the coronation of Rāma. Some of the salient features are : Rāma was shaved that day, had a bath and put on costly clothes. Sitā also was suitably dressed and ornamented. Rāma sat in a chariot and went through the capital, when Bharata held the reins, Satrughna held the umbrella, Laksmana the white chourie; then Rāma rode an elephant; drums were beaten and conches were blown; as auspicious signs gold, cows, maidens, brāhmaṇas, men with sweetmeats in their hands passed in front of Rāma; the citizens had raised banners on every house; Jāmbavān, Hanuman and two others brought four jars full of sea-water and waters of five hundred rivers were brought 

110. The Viṣnudharmottara (II. 128. 2-6) states that the hymn to Sri is different for each veda; the hymn of 15 verses beginning with 

Hiranyavarnim harinim' occurring in the parisista to the Rgveda is the one for Rgveda, the hymo of four verses beginning with ratbe aksesu vrsabhasya vāje' (Tai. Br. II, 7. 7) is the Srisūkta for the Yajurveda, the verse •ṣrāyagta iva' ( 267, 1319) for Samaveda aad 'sriyam dhātur mayi dehi' is the one for Atharvaveda. The Agnipurāna ( 237, 2-17) contains a hymn to Sri, which is not vedic but paurānic. Similarly the Rajadharma kaustubha (pp. 367-370) contains a long paurāoic hymn ( said to have been repeated by Indra ) to Sri which is to be recited while the king was to be seated on the throne after coronation. It is taken from the Viṣnupurāna 1.9.

in jars; the aged Vasiṣtha, the family priest, seated Rāma and Sitā on a jewelled throne; Vasistha and other sages sprinkled Rāma with the holy and scented waters, then maidens, the ministers, soldiers, the guilds of merchants also sprinkled Rāma; Vasiṣtha placed an ancient crown on Rāma's head; there was dancing and singing ; Rāma gave presents to the priests and to his friends and to such helpers as Sugrīva, Angada, Bibhiṣaña and others and Sitā gave a necklace to Hanumān, In the Ayodhyākānda 15 we have a description of preparations for the abhiṣeka of Rāma as yuvarāja. The Raghuvamsa XVII. 10 mentions the coronation of Kuśa's son with waters of holy rivers ( tirthas) from golden jars. 

In the Mahābhārata also there are several references to and descriptions of coronation. Vide Sabhā 33 (where people of all castes including śūdras were invited at the Rājasūya, yv 41-42 ) for the coronation of Yudhisthira; Santi 40 (in verses 9-13 the materials for coronation are described ); Adi 44, 85, 101 (only references ). 

The sambhāras (materials required) of coronation are stated in the Pratimānātaka (I.1) ascribed to Bhāsa and in the Pañcatantra III (after verse 75). 

In the Agnipurāna, chap. 218 deals with coronation and chap. 219 sets out the mantras. The following are the principal items in the ceremony; bath (with water in which sesame and mustard are mixed ), seating on bhadrāsana, proclamation of abhaya (security and non-injury to all), releasing some prisoners from jail, Aindri sānti, fast by king, recital of mantras, sancti fying the head and other limbs of the king with earth taken from the top of a mountain and from other places, sprinkling pancagavya, sprinkling of water from four jars of gold, silver, copper and earth by amātyas of the four varnas, abhiṣeka by a Rgvedin with water mixed with honey, by Chandoga with water mixed with. kusa grass, by Yajurvedin and Atharvavedin brāhmaṇas touching king's head and throat with yellow pigment, singing and beating of musical instruments, holding of chowrie and fan before the king, king's looking into a mirror and clarified butter, worship of Viṣnu and other gods, sitting on a tiger-skin below which there are four skins viz. of lion, cheeta, cat and bull; purohita to give madhuparka, to tie patta (a fillet or tiara ) round the king's head and to place the crown on his head; presentation of ministers by the pratihāra ;

king to give presents to the priests and other brāhmaṇas; going round fire ; doing obeisance to elders ; touching a bull; worshipping a cow with calf; riding a horse ; honouring an elephant and riding it; procession in the capital; honouring all people and taking leave of them. 

There are descriptions of the abhiṣeka of a yuvarāja (as of Bhima in Sānti 41 ), of a great commander (as of Bhiṣma in Udyogaparva 155,26-32 ), of Droṇa in Dropaparva 5.39-43, of Skanda in Salyaparva 45. 

The Rājanitiprakāśa (pp. 49-83), the Rajadharma-kaustubha (pp. 318-363 ) and Nitimayūkha pp. 1-4 quote from the Viṣnu dharmottara almost the whole of chapters 21-22 of the 2nd khanda that deal with the rites and mantras of coronation. It appears that the Kaustubha appropriates all the glosses of Mitramiśra. The Visnudharmottara (11. 19 ) sets out first the Sānti (propitiatory ) rite in honour of Indra (called the Paurandari or Aindri Santi'). It is impossible to give the details here, but a few matters may be noticed. The purāna (in II. 21 ) includes all the details from the Vedic texts (such as Svastyayana, Āyuṣya, Abhaya and Aparajita hymns) and adds other rites also. It mentions the procedure stated above from the Agnipurāna and employs Vedic mantras in doing so. In II. 22 the Visnudharmottara gives purāna mantras in 182 verses, in which such gods as Brahma, Naksatras (from Krttikā to Bharaṇi), the planets, 14 Manus, 11 Rudras, Viśve-Devas, Gandharvas and Apsarases, dānavas, dākinis, birds like Claruda, nāgas, sages like Veda-Vyāsa, emperors like Prthu, Dilipa, Bharata, vedas and vidyās, rivers &c, are invoked to crown the 

king. 

The Rājadharmakaustubha gives the most elaborate des cription of coronation. First a śānti rite is performed, then on the next (2nd) day, a sacrifice to Iśana (Rudra); on the 3rd day worship of the planets and other deities like waters, the earth, Nārāyana, Indra &c. and the invocation of nakṣatras; on the 4th day'a yāga for naksatras ; on the 5th day at night a sacrifice to the goddess Nirrti ( a clay idol seated on an ass with dark vesture ); on the sixth day Aindri Santi (propitiatory rite in honour of Indra); then the rites prescribed in the Viṣnu dharmottara purāna, 

The Visnudharmottara notes (II. 18.2-4) that on the death of the reigning king, there is no waiting for an auspicious time.

The successor should be bathed with water in which sesame and mustard are mixed, proclamation should be issued in his name that he has succeeded as king, the purohita and astrologer should show him to the people while he occupies a seat other than that occupied by the late king : the king should honour the people, proclaim peace and security, set free some prisoners and wait for the formal coronation, The Rājanītiprakāśa (p. 62 ) adds that on the death of a king his successor should be crowned one year thereafter and that when a king abdicates his successor may be crowned on any auspicious day without waiting for a year. From the fact that the Kalinga king Khāravela was crowned in his 25th year and the fact that the Bārhaspatya sūtra "l(1. 89-90) states that up to the 25th year the prince may spend his time in play and education and then in earning wealth, Jayaswal (in ‘Hindu Polity' part II. p. 52 ) concludes that a Hindu coronation could not take place before the 25th year. This is proving too much. The Bārhaspatya-gūtra says not a word about the age of coronation Authorities like the Visnu dharmottara require waiting for a year only after the death of the former king. 

The Visnudharmottara '18 (II. 7) specifies at great length the qualities of the principal queen ( agra-mahiṣi ), which are quoted by the Rājanitikaustubha pp. 249-250. The chief queen should have the coronation rite performed along with the king or she should be separately crowned after the king. Manu VII. 77 advises the king to marry a lady of noble family, of the same caste, of charming appearance and possessed of good 

qualities. The Rājatarangiṇi (VIII. 82) notes that Jayamati, the queen of the good king Uccala of Kashmir (1101-1111 A, D.), always occupied half his throne. 

The Nitimayūkha and Rajadharmakaustubha give tlie most detailed description of the Aindrl Santi. For want of space it has to be passed over. The Rājanitiprakāśa (pp. 63-66) and Rājadharmakaustubha (pp. 340-346 ) contain in one place a summary of the whole ceremony after Aindri Sānti commencing one day previous to the actual day of coronation.

rites is interesting, viz. after the learned brāhmaṇas and priests sprinkle the king with holy waters from soveral jars to the accompaniment of mantras and a Rgvedin brāhmaṇa touches the king's head and throat with powder of gorocanā with the mantra "gandhadvārām' (Tai. A. X. 1.10), principal virtuous ladies, whose song are alive, of the four varnas and also of mixed castes reciting auspicious songs (except the sūdra ladies who romain silent) should sprinkle the king with the waters derived from the sea and other holy places. "13 There is a graphic descrip tion of the coronation of Shivaji *13a the founder of the Maratha Empire in 1674 A. D. in the chronicle (bakluur) compiled by Krishnaji Anant Sabhasad (ed. by K. N. Sane, pp. 98-104), where it is said that a costly throne was prepared, from 108 places waters were brought in 108 golden jars (95 tirthas are actually named), Gāgābhatta and other brāhmanas officiated and sprinkled waters on the king, large gifts including the sixteen mahādānas were made. Eight ministers stood round the throne ( whose names and offices are set out), the head of the ecclesiastical department called Panditrao being to the right and the prime minister (mukhya pradhana ) to the left, an umbrella (chatra ) set with jewels was held over his head, new golden coins were struck and a new era was started called 'Rājyābhiṣoka'era commencing from that year. In a small work called 'Shivarāja-rājyābhiṣeka-kalpa taru '(published in the quarterly Journal of the Bhārata-itihāsa samsodhaka Mandala at Poona, vol. X part I pp. 28-40 ) in 236 verses it is stated that a Yogin named Niscalapurl, an adept in Tantrika rites, got a second coronation of Shivaji performed over three inonths aftor that perforined by Gāgābhatta, with Tāntrika mantras on Wednesday the 5th of the bright half of Āśvina sake 1596, one interesting fact stated being that Shivaji went through a form of marriage with vaidika mantras with his wives that had already been married to him with paurānic mantras,

The Viṣnudharmottara ( II. 12 ) states that the cāmara for the king must be made from the tails of camari deer and must be all white with a handle of gold or silver and that the one for a councillor or purohita should be yellowish, while the same purāṇa in 11. 13 describes the requisites of a royal umbrella. That the umbrella and cāmaras were inseparable emblems of sovereignty is emphasized by Kālidāsa in Raghuvainsa III. 16. Vide the Bphatsamhitā, chap. 71 and 72, for cāmara and umbrella. 

It appears that sometimes a king took another name on coronation which was called abhisekanānu. Vide Dr. R. C. Majumdar's 'Champā' p. 157 for a list of such names from Champā and Dr. Minakshi's 'Administrative and social life under Pallavas' p. 39 for the Pallava Rājasiinha having the coronation name Narasimhavarman. Certain kings, when they performed Aśvamedha, assumed new titles e. g. Kumāragupta I seems to have assumed the title of Mahendra, as is clear from some of his coins on which his name and title occur. 

The Bṛhatsamhita of Varāhamihira (chap. 48) lays down that the patta (tiara ) for the king and others should be made of pure gold, that their length should be double of the breadth in the middle of it, that there should be five aigrettes in the king's tiara, three in the queen's and yuvarāja's, one in that of the commander-in-chief and none in the one that the king may give to a person as a mark of favour. Utpala in his com, on the Brhatuamhitā says that patta is the same as mukuta, while acc. to the Nitimayūkha (p. 13) and other works patta is tied on the forehead and mukuta (crown) is placed on the king's head. Vide Rājanitiprakāśa (pp. 54–55) and Rajadharmakaustubha (p. 324) for further details. The Visnudharmottara ( II. 14 ) describes the characteristics of bhadrāsana ( the throne ) for the king; vide also Rājanitiprakāsa pp. 51-52. It must be made of gold, silver or copper or a tree from which milky juice oozes when cut, it was to be one cubit and half high for a saināt, 14 cubit for a king and one cubit high for a feudatory (sāmanta). 

The Visnudharmottara (II. 162 ) states that on every anni. versary of the first coronation when the moon is in the same nakṣatra as that on which the first coronation took place the king should repeat the rites of coronation. The Brahmapurāna

quoted by the R. D. K. (p. 10) also says the same. 113163 Vide Rājanitiprakāśa p. 115 and Kaustubha p. 379 also, 

Manu (VII. 217-220 ) warns the king against poisoning The king should partake of food that is well examined and prepared by servants that are trust-worthy (lit. as if they were his own self), that know the proper times (for dining), that cannot be won over and over the food spells destroying poison should have been muttered. He should mix up in all that he partakes medi cines that are antidotes against poison and should always wear gems that work against poison. Only women devoted to him and well examined and found safe as regards their dress and ornaments should be allowed to touch him when fanning or bath ing him or applying perfumes to his body. The king should take care in this way as regards his vehicles, bed, food, bath, applying perfumes and all ornamentation'. Kām. VII. 8 and Matsya 219.10 are very similar to Manu VII. 220. Kautilya (I. 17) states that the king should first secure his personal safety against his sons and wives and then the security of the kingdom against near and distant enemies. He first deals with safety from his own sons, the princes. The opinions of various authors on polity are cited (some of which have been noted above) viz. secret punishment (acc. to Bhāradvāja), keeping under guard in one place ( acc. to Viśālākṣa ), keeping the prince in a fort under the boundary guard (acc. to the Pārāśaras), keep ing the prince away from his own kingdom in a fort belonging to a feudatory (acc. to Piśuna), sending him to his maternal re lations (acc. to Kauṇapadanta), making the prince addicted to sensual pleasures (acc. to Vātavyādhi), proper pre-natal care and proper education after birth about dharma and restraint (acc. to Kaut.). This symposium shows how the problem of the king's safety against bad princes taxed the ingenuity of all ancient writers on Arthaśāstra and how Kautilya advocated the only reasonable course possible. The Matsyapurāṇa, chap. 220, also relies on training, discipline and gradual transfer of responsibility and advises the imprisonment of a bad prince in a well-guarded place furnished with comforts suitable to his

position ! In I. 20 Kautilya gives practical hints against the danger of fire and poisons : e. g. he says that poisonous snakes will not enter a building provided with Jivanti, Sveta and other plants; that cats, peacocks, mongoose and spotted deer when let loose eat serpents, that certain birds like parrots, mainus, malbar bird shiriek when they suspect snake poison, the heron loses his consciousness in the vicinity of poison; the pheasant (jivan jivaka) feels exhausted; the young cuckoo dies; the eyes of cukor become redder's Kām. (VII. 10-13) repeats the words of Kauṭ, 1.20 and the Matsya (219, 17-22) refers to the effects of poison on the same birds and a few others. The Matsyapurana in chap. 219-220 closely follows Kaut. and Kān. and appears to be based on them (e. g. Matsya 219. 30 latter half is the same as Kām. VII. 24 first half). Vide Yaśastilaka III. pp. 511-512 for the effects of poison on birds almost in the same words as those of Kaut. and Kām. Vide Sukra I. 326-328. Kaut. I. 21, Kāni. VII. 15-26, Matsya 219. 9-32 state that part of the food for the king should first be cast into fire and offered to birds and the effects noted, they dwell at great length on the different tints of the flames of fire and of the smoke when different kinds of food are cast into fire, they point out the actions and ges tures of the poisoner, they prescribe that the cook and the doctor giving medicines for mixing in food as antidotes should be made to partake of the food and then the king should himself partake of it. The king has to be careful in the harem, when receiving presents or anything sent by others, when sitting in a conveyance or riding a horse or travelling in a boat or when attending festivals (Kaut. I. 20-21, Kām. VII. 28-47). Kaut. 1.20 and Kān. (VII. 44 and 50) advise the king not to trust women and even the queen and to approach even the queen after she has been examined by men 80 years old and women over 50

Kings killed by stratagens

years in the larem and found 18 safe. Kaut. (I. 20) and Kām. (VII. 51-54) both name seven kings that met death in their queen's chambers by the stratagems of the queens themselves or those that were incited by them; viz. Bhadrasena killed by his brother concealed in the chamber of his queen (who was in love with the king's brother), the king of Karūṣa killed by his own son who had concealed himself under the bed of the queen (who was angered by the king's promise to give the kingdom to the son of a rival queen), the king of Kāśi killed by his queen who mixed fried rice with poison pretending that it was huney; the queen of the king of Sauvira killed him with a jewel in her girdle that was smeared with poison; Vairantya was killed by his queen with her anklet smeared with poison; Jalūtha (or Jarūsa in Kām.) was killed with a mirror (with a razor-like edge) covered with poison; Vidūratha was killed by his queen who had concealed a weapon in her braided hair. The Harṣa carita (VI) of Bāna mentions with additional details the cases of Bhadrasena king of Kalinga killed by his brother Virasena, the king of Karūsa ( Dadhra by name), Kāśirāja (named Mahā ssena) whose queen Suprabhā killed him to secure the kingdom tu her son, Jarūtha king of Ayodhyā, Vairantya named Rantideva, Viduratha of the Vrsnis killed by Bindumati, the Sauvira king Virasena killed by queen Hamsavati. In the Brhatsamhita (77. 1-2) two of these, Vidūratha and Kāśirāja, are mentioned, but the latter is said to have been killed by his estranged queen with an anklet smeared with poison. Medhātithi on Manu VII. 153 quotes four of these seven. The Nitivākyāmsta (raja raksāsamuddeśa 35-36, pp. 231-232) sets out six other examples of kings killed by their queens. The king has also to beware of treachery from ministers and officials. Kaut. (in I. 10) des. cribes how ancient writers devised methods of ascertaining the purity or impurity of ministers by putting before them allure. ments regarding dharma, wealth, sexual desires and playing on their fears and gives it as his own opinion that temptations that have direct reference to the king or queen should not be placed in the way of the ministers.

gupta, the commander of the elephant arm of Harsa's army, warns the Emperor against putting trust in everybody and gives 19 instances of kings that met misfortunes, death or des truction through their own carelessness and the stratagems of those about them (apart from the seven mentioned above and two more who fell victims to the wiles of their queens). Some of them are famous and deserve mention here, viz. the king of Vatsa (i. e. Udayana ) who was imprisoned by the soldiers of Mahāsena that jumped out of a faked elephant; Maurya Brhadratha killed by his Senāpati Puṣyamitra (called 'anārya' by Bāṇa on account of his treachery to his master); Kakavarna Saiśunāri (Śaisunāgi?), Sumitra, son of Agnimitra, whose head was cut off by Mitradeva while the king fond of dancing was in the midst of actors ; the Sunga Devabhūti killed by his minister Vasudeva; Candra gupta (of the Gupta dynasty ) who dressed as a charming woman cut off the king of Sakas; the foolish Maukhari king Ksatra varman killed by bards. Vide Kamagūtra V. 5.30 for two other examples of the Abhira king Kottaraja and Jayatsena king of Kāsi. The Nitivākyāmṛta (Dūtasamuddeśa) p. 171 states that Canakya killed one of the Nandas through a data and that two other kings met death from presents of poisoned clothes and a jewelled box containing snake poison. The Yasastilakacampū (III. pp. 431-432) sets out many instances of kings that met with death from the wrath or the machinations of their ministers, purohita &c. 

From these examples one should not draw the facile and gweeping conclusion that in India the life of no king was safe. In the vast continent of India there were always numerous king doms at the same time. It is no wonder that in the course of several thousand years and over such vast territories, some kings met death by treachery and stratagem. This is not a phenomenon restricted to India. In a small country like England we have within two hundred years instances of the murder of the boy king Edward V and his brother prince Richard, of Lady Jane Grey nominated by Edward VI as his successor and the further fact that Cromwell during the last few months of his life was afraid of being assassinated. During about 150 years froin 1789 out of 30 Presidents of the U.S. A. several such as Lincoln, Garfield and McKinley met death at the hands of assassins. 

The truth is that in a monarchy the king was the pivot of the whole State. As the Matsyapurāna ( 219.34 ) finely puts it 

III ] 

Hereditary neonarchy 

87 

* the king was the root and the subjects were the treo ; in saving the king from dangers the whole kingdom was on the road to prosperity and therefore all were to make efforts to guard the king. 

Hereditary monarchy was the norm of government in ancient and medieval India. Kautilya expressly states (I. 17 at ond) that the practice to make the eldest son the king is honoured except in the case of a calamity. At or about the time of Buddha and a few centuries thereafter there were a few oligarchies or (as some scholars prefer to call them ) republics. But our Dharmaśāstra or Arthasāstra authorities contain rather very meagre references to them. The Mahābhārata in Santi 107 furnishes the following data about .ganarājyas (government by groups ) : Internal dissensions are the root of the ruin of ganas; it is very difficult to keep lines of policy secret when there are many (when the government is that of many, i.e. an oligarchy or a republic); all members of the gana in their entirety do not deserve to hear the line of policy decided upon, but the chief persons among the gaṇas should meet together and arrange among themselves to secure the welfare of the whole gana; if disputes that arise among the families (or clans) are connived at by the heads of the clan, the ruin of the clan takes place which leads on to dissensions among the whole group (gana ). Danger from internal dissensions must be guarded against (in thie case of ganarājya ), external dangers are not serious ( in the case of ganarājya). All members of the gana are equal by birth and family, but they are not equal in energy, intelligence, bodily appearance and wealth. By their enemies ganas are broken by means of internal dissensions and bribes; therefore the greatest safety of ganas lies in union '17. In these words the author of the Mahābhārata unerringly puts his finger on the weak spots of the rule of many viz. secrecy cannot be kept, there is corruption due to greed and jealousy, which bring about their downfall. In another place (Sānti 81 ) the Mahabharata

refers to the ruingha of the Vrsnis, of whom Krsna was the presi dent, and the great truth that the ruin of sanglia:3 is brought about by internal dissensions and corruption and it hits off the qualities required in the wise leader of the sangha to be four viz. sagacity, forbearance, self-control and giving up the acqui sitive spirit. The words sangha and saṇa are employed as synonyms in the Mahābhārata. Pāṇini (III. 3.86 ) states that sunyha means gana. Patañjali in his Mahābhāṣya ( vol. II. p. 356) states that sangha, samūlu and samudāyn mean the same thing. Pāṇini knows two kinds of sanghas viz, ayudhajivin (who practis od the profession of arms) and those that were not go and further he also indicates that in the Vāhika country sanghas included 118 brāhmanas, ksatriyas and others ( vide V.3. 114). He names the sanghag of Vṛkas, Trigartas, Yaudheyas, Parsus (V. 3.115-117 ) as āyudluijivin. Kātyāyana by his vārtiku * kṣatriyadekarājāt sanghapratiṣedhārtham' on Panini IV. 1.168 shows that sangha was differentiated from monarchy. Acc. to Kautilya (p. 53 above ) the sangha of the Vrsnis perished when it came in conflict with Dvaipāyana. In another place Kautilya says that (in some cases ) the kingdom may be ruled by a clan, for the confederacy 19 of a clan is invincible, it is free from the calamity of a kingless State and therefore exists on the earth very long. Kautilya devotes one section (Adhikarana XI) to the dealings of the ambitious king with sanghas. There he states that securing the sangha on one's side is far better tlian securing an army or allies and makes the most interesting remark 18? that the corporation of the kṣatriyas and others in

In chap. 44. 10 it is stated that their chief city is Sākala and in verses 11-30 and 35-38 their condemned practices are set out, and verses 31-34 say that the country of the five rivers is called Āratta and Vāhika. In Karnaparva 45, 6-13 the interesting fact is mentioned that in that country only one brother in a family acts as a brāhmana should and that their sons do not inherit but their sister's sons take the inheritance.

the countries of Kāmbhoja and Surāstra practise vūrtū (husbandry and trade ) and the profession of arms, while those of the Licchivikas, Výjikas, Mallakas, Madrakas, Kukurai, Kurus and Pāñcālas live on the title of rājan applied to them (i. c. they are not cultivators of the soil and soldiers, but are only chiefs or nobles). What Kautilya means by "vārtā-sastropa jivinah' appears to be that they were agriculturists ordinarily but were ready with their swords to defend their country when occa:ion required. Kautilya then describes in detail without any scruples how the conqueror may by various subterfuges cause dissensions among the members of the sangha and its leader or leaders (sanylur-mukhya). In VIII. 3 Kautilya remarks that dissension becomes particularly rife owing to gambling among sanghas and noble clans that have the sangha constitution and they are destroyed. From about the 5th or 6th century A. D. the oligarchic States or Republics became rare and gradually disappeared. We get further data about these ganarājyas from Buddhist works, Greek sources (like the fragments of Megasthenes), coins and inscriptions. Rudradāman ( in Junagadh Inscription of 150 A, D.) boasts that he had uprooted the Yaudheyas who had become puffed up and unbending on account of the title of heroes (vira) that was prominently applied to them among all ksatriyas 181 (E. I. vol. VIII. at p. 44). Samudragupta ( in the first half of the 4th century A. D.) subjugated the Yaudheyas, Mālavas, Arjunayanas &c. In Gupta Inscriptions No. 58 p. 251 there is mention of a mahārāja-mahūsenāpati who was made their leader by the Yaudlieya-gaṇa. The Bphatsamhita in several places refers to the Yaudleyas and Arjunāyanas (e. g. 4.25 ; 5.40, 67, 75; 14.25 and 28; 16.21 ; 17,19 ) and speaks of Yaudheya-nṛpa in 9.11. Vide Rapson's 'Indian coins' pp. 11 and 15 and Plate II, nos. 13-15 and Plate Ill, no. 20 for the coins of the Yaudheyas and Arjuna yanas. Arrian writes in 'Indika' (tr. by MacCrindle IX. p. 208, ed. of 1926 ) 'from Dionysus to Sandrakottos the Indians counted 153 kings and a period of 6042 years, but among them a republic was thrice established'. MacCrindle's 'Invasion of India' (p. 121 ) speaks of an aristocratic government on the

Hyphasis or Beas. The Greek writers describing the invasion 

of Alexander speak of the democracies of the Oxydrakai (Ksudrakas), Malloi (the Mālavas), the Siboi (Sibis), Sambastai (the Ambasthas) and several others. Vide K. P, Jayaswal's "Hindu Polity' part I. chap. VIII (pp. 63–79) for Hindu Repub lics mentioned in Greek writings. Rhys Davids in 'Buddhist India' pp. 19 ff. summarizes the data about Indian republics derived from Buddhist works. On p. 22 he gives the names of eleven republican clans with their capitals, some of which like the Sakyas (of Kapilavastu ), the Mallas (of Kusināra and Pāvā), the Videhas (of Mithilā) and Licchavis (of Vesāli) are well known. Rhys Davids states (p. 19) that the administrative and judicial business of the Sakyas was carried on in a mote-hall (santhāgāra) at Kapilavastu, that a single chief was chosen (but how and for what period is not known) who presided over the sessions and (when no sessions were being held) also over the State, that he bore the title of rūjā. He mentions that at one time Buddha's cousin Bhaddiya was rājā and that in another passage Buddha's father Suddhodana is styled rājā. He further points out (p. 26) that the Vajjians had eight confederate clans of which the Licchavis and the Videhas were the most impor tant. K. P. Jayaswal in 'Hindu Polity' part I pp. 25-165 brings together all the data about Hindu oligarchies (or repub lics as he calls them) and his work deserves the serious atten tion of all those who are interested in the study of ancient Indian political institutions, though here and there one cannot approve of his interpretations and theories. To take only one example, he holds that the procedure prescribed by Buddha for the deliberations of the sangha in the Mahāparinibbāṇa-sutta was borrowed from the procedure followed by the republics in their deliberations and therefore he describes the procedure of the Buddhist sangha in great detail ('Hindu Polity,' part I chap. XI pp. 103-117). Dr. D. R. Bhandarkar also (in 'Some Aspects of Ancient Hindu Polity' pp. 121-125 ) adopts this theory. This to say the least is a gratuitous assumption. The mere fact that Buddha told the prime minister of Ajātaśatru, king of Magadlia, who contemplated attacking the Vajjian confederacy, that the latter would not decline but prosper as long as they observed seven conditions and the fact that those very seven conditions were prescribed by the Buddha for the welfare of the sangha do not lead on to the further inference that the procedure followed by the monks in the deliberations of the meeting of the sangha (which is set out in such passages as the Mahavagga IX. 3, S.B.E. 

DI) . Procedure nf oligarchic assemblies 

Whir gesemblies 

91 

vol. XVII p. 264 ff, Cullavagga IV. 9, S. B. E, vol. XX pp. 24-27) was the procedure of the meetings of the oligarchies. The seven conditions (both for the welfare of the Vajjians and the Sangha) are set out in the Mahāparinibbāṇa-sutta, chap. I. (8. B. E. vol. XI. pp. 3-8) viz. holding full and frequent public assem blies, meeting together in concord and carrying out undertakings in concord, enacting nothing not already established and abro gating nothing that has been already enacted and acting in accordance with ancient institutions established in former days, honouring and revering and supporting elders and hearkening to their words, not detaining women or girls of their clans by force or abduction, honouring and supporting Vajjian shrines in town or country and not allowing proper offerings and ritos to fall into deguetude, protecting and supporting the Arahats among them. On the most important points in connection with a republic or oligarchy we have no information at all, viz. who were entitled to vote, what were the qualifications for membership of the assenibly, that governed the State, how voting took place, what was the period for which mem bers of the assembly were elected, whether the president was elected for life or a shorter period or was elected at all, what were the powers and procedure of the assembly, Vide Dr. Beni Prasad in 'Hindu Political Theories' p. 158 for criticisms. Rhys Davids ( in ' Buddhist India' p. 41 ) says that according to the Jātakas there were at Vesāli (modern Basadh in the Muzaffarpur District ), the capital of the Licchavis, 7707 rājās (or chiefs). In the Bhaddasāla-jātaka (Fausböll, vol. IV p. 148) there is a reference to a tank reserved for the bath of the families of the ruling chiefs ( rājās ) of the gana in the city of Vesāli. In the Mahāvastu ( ed. by Senart vol. I. p. 271) it is stated that there were twice eighty-four thousand nobles (rājānā) among the Licchavis. This explains what Kautilya means by * rājaśabdopajivinaḥ. These people called ' rājās' were probably the scions of the several branches of the Licchavis, who had in their hands the government and who were not doing manual (or agricultural ) work. Vide Government Epigraphic Report for 1899 p. 23 and Indian Historical Quarterly vol. IV p. 652, where it is said that in an inscription from Uttaramallur the extent of land and of Vedic learning required in a candidate for elec tion are specified as also the method of writing on tickets the names of candidates. But such records, even in South India, are very few and refer to village sabhas and there is nothing in the works on dharmaśāstra or arthaśāstra about the methods of92

election to political assemblies and the qualifications of candi dates. Vide Dr. D. R. Bhandarkar's 'Some aspects of Ancient Hindu Polity' ( 1929 ) pp. 101-121 for a conciso statement of several types of republics in Ancient India. 

Another important question is whether in monarchical states there were popular assemblies of elected representatives or, in modern language, Parliaments. The words 'sabha' and 'samiti' require consideration in this connection. In Rg. I. 91.20 Soma is said to confer a son who is sādanya, ridathya and sableya, from which it follows that sabha is in some respects different from 

vidatha'. In Rg. II. 24. 13 a vipra (a priest or composer of hymns) is said to be sabheya 'clever or eminent in a sabhā'. In Rg. X. 34. 6 'sabhā' 12% appears to mean a gambling hall. In Vāj. S. XXX. 6 sabhācara seems to mean only 'sabhāgad', a mem ber of a judicial tribunal, while in XXX. 18 the sabhāsthanu is given up to Askanda in the symbolic Puruṣamedha. In the Vāj. S. XVI. 24 there is an obeisance to sublās and subhāpatis (presidents of sabhās). In Atharvaveda VII. 12. 1 'sabhā' and 'samiti' are said to be the two daughters of Prajāpati, from which it may by argued that they were very similar but somewhat different. In Atharva veda XV. 9.2 also sabhā and samiti are separately mentioned. In Tai. Br. III. 7,4, the word sabhāpāla occurs and sabhā is explained as gambling-hall' by Sāyapa. In Rg. X. 97.6 and Vāj. S. XII. 80 it is said that vipra is said to be a doctor (bhisak) in whom medicinal herbs come together as nobles ( rājānah) in a samili (meeting or battle)'. In Rg. X. 191. 3 the word "samiti' seems to mean no more than a meeting or meeting place. In Atharvaveda V.19.15183 we have the assembly (samiti) does not suit him (or is not won over by him ) who harasses a brāhmaṇa'. In the Chāndogya Up, (V.3.1) Svetaketu is said to have repaired to the assembly (simiti) of the Pañcāla country, where the king Pravāhana Jaivali asked him five questions which the former could not answer and then he approached the next morning the king who was in his sabhā. Here it seems that both words are applied to the same assembly. It is impossible to say how the sabhā or samiti was constituted in the Vedic period. All that we can say is that it was an assembly of people to which the king, learned men and others went. It is extremely doubtful whether it was an elective body, Probably it was an ad hoc assembly of such people as cared to

Meaning of sabha and samiti 

be present. K. P. Jayaswal ( in 'Hindu Polity' part I p. 11 ) holds that 'samiti' in the vedic age was the national assembly of the whole people, that it was the king's duty to attend it (ind. p. 12 ) and that'sabba' was the standing and stationary body of selected men working under the authority of the samiti (ibill. p. 18)'. This is all conjectural, as Jayaswal himself admits 'the sabhū was certainly related to the samiti, but its exact relationship is not deducible from the data available' (ibid. p. 18). 

These frantic efforts by such scholars as Jayaswal to prove that India had elective assemblies are made to counteract the sinister propaganda of many English writers that East is East and West is West and that the democratic institutions of the West cannot be transplanted with success on the soil of India. This is mischievous propaganda. There were no democracies even in Europe a few hundred years ago; even in England, France and a few other countries democraciey have been intro duced and have thrived within a short time. There is no reason why they should not do so in India, if honest efforts are made and difficulties are not purposely created by vested interests. Korkunov in 'General theory of law'(tr. by Hastings, 1922, New York p. 296 ) says. According to the historical school the political organization of England is good for England alone, for it corresponds to a natural genius very peculiar.... This doctrine of the historical school is false, since we have already seen that a change produced in the social ideal may bring about a change in the whole social development. The influence of une people on the life of another is a proof of this. The ideal is a force supporting the social life and this ideal may be the result not merely of our own special experience, but also of the experience of neighbouring peoples '. 

Two other words require consideration, viz. Paura and Jūnapada. The word 'paura' occurs in Rg. V. 74, 4 where it has three applications, viz. to the Aśvins, to the sage Paura ( who was an Atreya) and to the cloud (acc. to Sāyana ). K. P. Jayaswal ( in 'Hindu Polity', part II pp. 60-108 ) devotes considerable space to 'Paura' and 'Jānapada' and one may at unce admit that he displays great learning, industry and ingenuity in his discourse on this subject. He holds that the Paura and the Jānapada were elective parliamentary bodies or what may be called the Hindu Diet and he sums up (on p. 108 ) their functions as follows 'we had an organism or a twin

[ Vol. 

organism, the Paura Jānapada, which could depose the king, who nominated the successor to the throne ..., whose President was apprised by the king of the policy of state decided upon in the council of ministers, who were approached and begged by the king in all humility for a new tax, whose confidence in a minister was regarded as an essential qualification for his appointment as Chancellor, who demanded and got industrial, commercial and financial privileges for the country, who could enact statutes even hostile to the king, in fine who could make possible or impossible the administration of the king.' This is a very glowing picture of parliamentary institutions in ancient India. But unfortunately it cannot be accepted as the truth. Many scholars such as Prof. B. K. Sarkar ( in ' Political Institutions and theories of the Hindus' p. 71 ) and Dr. Beni Prasad ( in 'The State in ancient India' pp. 498-500 ) do not subscribe to this theory. For want of space detailed examina tion of Jayaswal's theory cannot be entered upon. But a few remarks must be made. The sheet anchor of his theory (in ‘Hindu Polity' part II. p. 68) is a passage in the Hāthigumpha Inscription of Khārvela (E. I. vol. XX at p.79 11.6–7) which runs "Rājasūyam samdasayamto sava-kara-vanam anugaha-anekāni satasahasāni visajati poram jānapadam' and which he himself translates ( at p. 78 ) as 'remits all tithes and cesses, bestows many privileges amounting to hundreds of thousands on the paura and jānapada'. Jayaswal himself has changed his views about the interpretation of this difficult record so many times (e. g. J. B. O. R. S. vol. III pp. 425-507 may be compared with his interpretations in E. I. vol. XX p.71 ) that one can never feel sure even of his latest readings and translations. As a matter of fact Dr." Barua differs and reads 'pora-jānapadam' as one word (I. H. Q. vol. 14 p. 464 ) and does not accept Jayaswal's interpretation (p. 477). If the word is 'pora-jānapadam' it would simply be a samāhāra-rivanda compound and mean "all inhabitants of the capital and the rural inhabitants.' and the singular need not necessarily lead to the inference that a parliament of city-dwellers and rural population is meant Even supposing that the correct reading is poram-jang padam.. that would not matter much. We shall have to understand the word janam' after it, since the word 'jana' is often employed after paurajānapada' e. g. in the 8th Rock Ediot at Girnar * janapadasa ca janasa dasanam' C.II. vol. I. pp. 14–15, in Rudradāman's inscription in E. I. vol. VIII p. 44 'apidayitvā paura-jānapadam janam' and 'paurajānapada-janānugrahārtham'

at p. 45 or in the Rāmāyana II. 2.51, II. 111. 19 'paurajā napadam janam'). Lastly if the paurajānapada organization had (as said by Jayaswal in the quotation cited above) the power to depose kings and pass even hostile statutes, is it not a contradic tion in terms to say that, instead of the Parliament or Diet deciding to remit certain taxes, it was the king who remitted taxes and bestowed favours (or privileges ) of lakhs of rupees on the supposedly all powerful Paura-Jānapada assembly? In all passages that he quotes from the Rāmāyana and other classical sanskrit works the ordinary meaning of puura ( residents of the capital ) and jānapuda ( inhabitants of the country other than the capital ) is quite enough and it is impossible to hold that any elective body is meant. In most passages the plural 'paura jānapadān' is used. If Paura-jānapada' stands for one elective body or two bodies, no explanation is offered why the plural should generally be used and not the dual. Kautilya (I. 19) states that the king should in the 2nd part of the day (divided into eight parts ) look into the causes of the paura-jānapadas. Jayaswal (in 'Hindu Polity', part II p. 95 ) misinterprets this passage by saying that the king had to set apart one period daily for the business of the paura-jānapada assembly. Here again the plural is used and the dictum of Kautilya is the same as that of Yāj. I. 327 who says that the king should look into the law-suits (vyavahārān) of the people. The word "kārya' is employed by Manu VIII. 43, Nārada and other writers on vyavahāra in the sense of 'law-suit'. Yāj. II. 36 says that the king should restore to the jānapada property stolen by thieves. Jayaswal ( in 'Hindu Polity', part II. p. 93 ) presses the singular 

jānapadāya' into his service and holds that it was the popular assembly that demanded the restoration of the things stolen. This, to say the least, is twisting the plain words of Yāj. The Mit. paraphrases the word to mean 'to the person dwelling in his country from whom the property was stolen'. The corren ponding passage of Manu VIII. 40 ( dātavyain sarva-varnebhyo rājñā corair-hstam dhanam) is quite clear, since it fortunately does not use the word jānapada and Medhātithi explains it as 'it should be restored to those from whom it was stolen'. Jayaswal (in Hindu Polity' part II p. 79 ) holds that a passage in the Arthasāstra (II. 14 ) refers to the fact that the Paura-Jānapada assembly got gold coins minted by the royal mint-master. 184 

124. raforaltaragrat Corvo TustinTH: Free frontare 9811 HUT II. 14.

I Vol. 

But the plain meaning is that the mint-master was to mint standard silver and gold coins for all people when they brought bullion to him to have coins struck. One striking circumstance to be considered is that, though in all works on polity a rajya is said to have seven elements, none of them includes a political elective assembly (like the paura-jānapada postulated by Jayaswal) among them. They only enumerate the country and the capital and declare even these as of lesser importance than the king and the ministers. Another matter that makes the existence of powerful elective political assemblies in monarchies most unlikely is the total absence of any reference in works on polity to the method of election, the system of voting, the qualifica tions of members, the period for which the assembly was elected and allied matters. When medieval writers like Aparārka on Yāj. II. 1 (p. 600 ) quote from Bṛhaspati versos about four kinds of sabhā, they refer only to judicial tribunals of various sorts and grades ( the same verses are quoted as Hārita's in Rājaniti ratnākara p. 20). Vide n. 368 below. 

If elective popular assemblies did not exist, then it may be asked whether the king was an absolute monarch or a despot or whether there were any checks that mitigated or regulated the power and doings of monarchs. The answer is that there were such checks and limitations. These were of various kinds. Exhortations addressed to the king himself exercised a restrain ing influence. For example, Kāt, (10) says 'the king who gives way to wrath without proper thought would reside in a liorrible hell for half a Kalpa'. The importance of dharma as an all enibracing institution was impressed upon the king by our writers so frequently that it must have had its psychological effect on every king. The idea that danda personified as a Deity might strike down the bad king himself (Manu VII. 19, 27, 28, 30, Yaj. I. 354-356 ) would tend to keep even a whimsical king within bounds. The views of ancient writers have already been cited according to which the king was not to act as he pleas ed, but was to regard his high office as a sacred trust and was to rule according to the dictates of the śāstras. These views created public opinion which must have certainly influenced the king's acts. The ideal king Rāma is depicted as having abandoned his queen Sita ( whom he knew to be pure ) because the people could not accept her as pure after her long stay in Rāvana's prison. Vide Rāmāyaṇa VII. 45. Then there were the ministers whose advice the king was enjoined to seek. Besides there was the purohita and there were learned brāhmaṇas,

who were to propound what dharma was, whose directions he was to carry out and who were supposed to have power to ruin a bad king (vide Vas. I. 39-41, Gautama XI. 12-14, Manu IX. 320). Vide H. of Dh. vol. II. pp. 138-145 for the peculiar sanctity attaching to the person of a brāhmaṇa and the superior position of brāhmaṇas as a class vis-a-vis the king. There was a deep rooted faith that the rules of the śāstras ( the Srauta and Smārta dharma ) were divinely inspired and were above the king, Observance of dharma was the great social and political ideal from very ancient times for all including the king. This is most emphatically put in the Bș. Up. I. 4. 11-14, where it is stated " even after creating the four varnas He ( the Creator) did not think that stability had been attained. He then created the most excellent Dharma which is the might of the mighty ( i. e. more powerful than the warrior caste ). There is nothing higher than dharma. Even a very weak man hopes to prevail over a very strong man on the strength of dharma, just as (he prevails over a wrong-doer ) with the help of the king. So what is called dharma is really truth. Therefore people say about a man who declares the truth that he is declaring dharma and about one who declares what dharma is they say that he speaks the truth. These two (dharma and truth) are this " (i. e. one). 145 Kāmandaka I. 14 stated that the Yavana king ruled over the earth for a long time because he ruled according to the dictates of dharma. In his administration of justice the king was to be checked by the judge and sabhyas, who were fearlessly to render advice to the erring king (as will be shown in the section on vyavahāra). Besides corporations and guilds were powerful and had a sort of self-government. Manu (VIII. 336 and Yaj. I. 307) went so far as to prescribe a heavy fine which the king was to inflict on himself for his illegal exactions and punishments and to direct that the king should distribute among brāhmanas wealth forfeited by grave sinners (Manu IX. 243-244). Lastly there was the final sanction that the śāstras allowed the subjects to abandon a worthlegs king or even to kill a misguided one or tyrant, as stated above (vide Manu VII. 27-28, Arthaśāstra I. 4).128

(Vol. 

Kautilya (VIII. 3) when dealing 127 with the evil results of want of discipline in a king states that kings who are hot tempered are known to have fallen victims to popular fury (or the fury of ministers ). We may say that in theory and so far as ordinary people were concerned the sovereign's power was absolute and unlimited as Manu IX. 9-12 aptly illustrate and as Bphat Parāśara states 'the king is Brahma, Siva, Viṣnu, Indra, he is the giver, the destroyer, and the enforcer according to the karma of his subjects'. But there were ( as stated above) very real checks and limitations that effectively prevented him from exer cising his undoubtedly unlimited powers. These checks, though real, cannot be called constitutional in the sense in which that word is used in modern times. As said by Nārada the subjects are dependent while the king is uncontrolled, but he could not go against the śāstra ( vide Haradatta on Gaut. XI. 2). 

In modern times the activities of a sovereign person are three-fold, viz. executive, judicial and legislative. The judicial activities of the ancient Indian king will be dealt with in another section on law and the administration of justice. One great difference between ancient and modern societies is that the legislative action of the king was extremely limited in ancient times, while in modern times people are more and more looking to legislation for regulating all manner of things. Manu (VII. 13 ) lays down that since the king has in him the glory of all deities, whatever rule as regards desirable matters the king establishes and whatever action he declares as un desirable among those actions that are harmful, should not be transgressed by any one. ' In his gloss on this verse Medhātithi carefully points out what orders the king can issue and on what subjects he cannot issue orders. He gives the following inst ances of orders of both kinds: 'To-day all should observe a festival in the capital; all should attend a marriage ceremony at the house of the minister; animals should not be killed to-day by the butchers and birds should not be caught; debtors should not be harassed by creditors on these days ( to be specified); no one should associate with such and such a man (an undesirable person); no one should allow a certain (undesirable) person to enter the house'. Medhātithi adds that the king is not authorised to interfere with the gastric rules governing the

varṇas and āśramas such as the performance of agnihotra. 147a This gloss of Medhātithi occurs word for word in the Rājaniti. prakāśa (pp. 23-24 ), which gives a more correct text than the printed editions of Mandlik and Gharpure. Kautilya (II. 10) devotes a chapter to the drawing up of śāsanas, particularly with reference to their linguistic elegance and diplomatic etiquette. The Sukranitisāra (1.312-313) prescribes that the king's edicts ( sāsana ) should be proclaimed to the subjects by beat of drum, that his edicts should be written and displayed where four roads meet, and that the king should declare that breaches of the orders would entail heavy fines. In I. 292-311 Sukra gives instances of such orders, the most important of which are: Watchmen should take rounds in the several streets every one hour and a half at night in order to prevent thieves and paramours moving about; people should not employ abuse or beating towards their slave, servant, wife, son or pupil; no one should practise deceit in respect of measures, weights, coins, resins, metals, ghee, honey, milk, fat, flour; no document should be got by force ; no bribes should be taken nor should any bribes be given to persons engaged in doing the king's work; no one should offer shelter to bad characters, thieves, paramours, those who hate the king, the enemy; parents, persons worthy of honour, learned men, men of good character should not be disrespected or ridiculed; no dissensions should he sown between husband and wife, master and servant, between brothers, between teacher and pupil, between father and son; no interference or obstruction should be caused to wells, parks, boundaries, dharnuuśālās, temples, roads or to those who are deficient in a limb; without the king's permission no one should engage in gambling, selling liquor, hunting, bearing arms, sale or purchase of cattle or elephants or horses or camels or she-buffaloes or slaves or immoveable property or silver, gold, gems, intoxicants, poisons, drugs, the profession of medicine or should pass a sale deed, deed of gift or give a decision about a debt; no one should falsely accuse another of the great sins, nor take treasure trove, nor frame new rules for clubs or con vivial gatherings ( samāja) nor should publish slander against a caste, nor should appropriate property which is without an owner or has been lost, nor divulge the ( king's ) lines of policy, nor babble about the vices of the king; the people should not

even think of forsaking their dharma, speaking untruth, commit ting adultery with another's wife, giving false evidence or fabricating documents, accepting gifts secretly, committing thefts and engaging in other desperate acts, engaging in sedi tion; public servants should not exact more than the tax already settled ; only such weights and measures are to be used as bear the royal stamp; all subjects should strive to possess good qualities; desperadoes should be arrested and handed over to the king; bulls let loose (in memory of the dead ) should be kept well controlled and fed by those who let them loose. Medhātithi on Manu VIII. 399 states that a king may prohibit the export of foodstuffs from the kingdom in a famine. The several edicts of Asoka show that his orders were framed on the same lines that are contained centuries later on in the Sukra nitisāra. Most of his proclamations insist on moral virtues such as truthfulness, obedience and reverence to parents, elders and preceptors, honouring brāhmaṇas and śramaṇas, kindness to animals, tolerance of other faiths. Proclamations that may be called positive laws are very few, such as his order in Pillar Edict IV to give three days' respite to criminals condemned to death (C. I. I. vol. I p. 125 ) or his regulations restricting the killing of animals contained in the 5th Pillar Edict (C. I. I. vol. I. p. 138 ) or in the First Rock Edict at Girnar (p. ) 'no living being must be killed or sacrificed and no festival meeting must be held'. In the reign of Avanti varman of Kashmir the killing of living beings was prohibited for ten years ( vide Rājatarangini V. 64). Law-making in the modern sense is almost entirely lacking in the smrtis. Gaut. XI. 19-25. show 128 that the king was to find the law required for the decision of causes from the following, viz. (1) the Veda, Dharmaśāstras, the Angas (lores auxiliary to the Veda such as grammar, exegesis, metrice etc.), Upavedas, Purāpas; (2) customs of countries, castes and families that were not opposed to the Veda; (3) the usages of husbandmen, traders, herdemen, money lenders and artizans; (4) ratiocination;(5) the opinions 188a delivered

by the assembly (parisad) of men deeply learned in the three Vedas. The authoritativeness of custome, usages and conven tions and their relation to śāstra will be discussed later on. In the decision of causes there were four deciding factors, dharma, vyavahāra, caritra and rājaśāsana, which will also be dealt with later. So royal edicts or orders first came to be made in the administration of justice and probably served as laws or precedents in later times. Vide H. of Dh. vol. II. pp. 968–970 for the role of pariṣads in religious matters. Yāj. I. 9 and Saṅkha speak of parṣat or assembly of learned men as final authorities on dharma. 

The executive functions of the king required a large number of ministers and officers. This topic will be dealt with immedia tely below. 

There is another way of looking at the king's functions viz. they were religious and secular. The first required him to do certain acts for propitiating gods and unseen powers and removing dangers therefrom with the help of the purohita and sacrificial priests ( vide Gaut. XI. 15-17, Yāj. I. 308 ) and he had to guard dharma. His secular functions included those that led to prosperity, that helped the people in famine and similar calamities, dealing even-handed justice, guarding person and property from thieves and trespassers and against invasion, 

The Mahābhārata records the tradition that many kings of former times abdicated the throne in favour of their song and resorted to the forest as hermits. Vanaparva 202.8 mentions Bṛhadaśya who crowned his son Kuvalāśva. Vide also Vāyu 88.32. Dhrtarāstra says to Yudhisthira that in their family it was customary for kings to transfer the sovereignty to their song and resort to a forest towards the close of their lives ( Aśramavābi 3.38). Vyāsa says that that was the practice of all rājargis (Aśramavāsi 4.5) and the Aśramavāsiparva (20) mentions the names of several such kings. Vide also Santi 21.15. In Ayodhyā 23.27, 94.19 this practice is referred to. 189 In the Raghuvamsa (I. 8, XVIII. 7, 9, 26) Kalidasa says that in the family of Raghu kings in their old age became munis (hermits) and in chap. VIII. 11-23 he draws a fine contrast between the lives of Aja and his father Raghu ( who had become a yati). There are Jain traditions of some antiquity that connect the

Vide Indian Antiquary, vol. 21 pp. 156 ff where Fleet criticizes this tradition and rejects it. In the Divyavadana (XXIX p. 431, ed. by Cowell and Neil) it is stated that Asoka died destitute of power 180 and possessions and Fleet (in J. R. A.S. for 1913 pp. 656-658) says that there is in this probably a reminiscence of abdication by Aśoka. King Lavanaprasāda of the Vaghela dynasty in Gujerat abdicated in favour of his son Viradhayala (1233-38 A. D.). Vide Bombay Gazetteer, vol. I part 1 pp. 198, 200, 206. 

___Kautilya (VIII. 2) speaks of a novel rule called 'dvai rājya' 131 (sovereignty of two) and distinguishes it from 'vairajya'. The Mss. differ in their readings, but the reading given in the footnote by Dr. Sham Sastri seems preferable, Kaut. remarks "As between dvairajya and vairajya (foreign rule) the former perishes on account of mutual hatred and rivalry; but the latter according to the ūcāryas is enjoyed by foreigners as it is, when it pays attention to winning over the subjects; 'No' says Kautilya 'dvairājya' (generally) exists between father and son or between two brothers, their welfare is the same and therefore by reason of the influence of amātyas (over the two rulers) it can last, but uairājya comes into existence by being seized from another king who is living and therefore the (foreign ruler) thinking this country is not mine' impoverishes it and carries off its wealth or treats it as a chattel (for sale ) or when he finds that the country is disaffected towards him abandons it and goes away". This remarkable passage contains the mentality of foreign rulers in a nutshell Manu IV, 160 in a lucid and laconic manner states how in dividual and national happiness lies in freedom. Kālidāsa in his Malavikāgnimitras (Act V) appears to refer to the conception

of dvairājya when he makes Agnimitra say that the latter desires to establish a dvairājya for the brothers Yajñasena and Madhavasena on the north and south banks of the river Varadā, who would both remain under the command of the king (Agni mitra). In the Mahābhārata a similar rule of two brothers, Vinda and Anuvinda in Avanti, appears to be referred to (vide Udyogaparva 166, cr. ed. chap. 163). MacCrindle in 'Invasion of India by Alexander' p. 296 quotes Diodorus to the effect that Alexander sailing up the river came to Taula (Patala?) a city of great note with a political constitution drawn on the same lines as the Spartan, for in this community the command in war was vested in two hereditary kings of two different houses, while a council of elders ruled the whole State with paramount authority. Vide Jayaswal's 'Hindu Polity' part I pp. 96-97 and Dr. D. R. Bhandarkar's 'Ancient Indian Polity'p. 99-100 for some further details on dvairājya from Buddhist and other sources. 

## 04 Ministers

CHAPTER IV 

MINISTERS 

Amatya -The second of the seven elements of rājya is the amālya, which word may be translated as 'minister.' There are three words that are interchangeable though sometimes dis tinguished, viz. amõtya, saciva and mantrin, the first being the oldest of the three. A Kārikā on Pāṇini (IV. 2. 104) teaches the formation of the word with the affix tyap (tya ) from ama meaning near or with'( vide Mahābhāsya, vol. II. p. 292). In Rg. IV. 4. 1 188 there is the germ of this word 'O Agnil Go like a king riding an elephant, accompanied by his ministers '. Yāska (in Nirukta VI. 12 ) explains' amayān ' as 'amātya vān,' though two more explanations of the word are offered by him. The word amatya itself occurs in Rg. VII. 15. 3, but there it is an adjective and means 'our own' or ' abiding in our house '. In some of the sūtras like the Baudhāyanapitf-medhasūtra (I. A. 13, I. 12. 7 ) the word amātya is used in the sense of 'near male relations in the house'. Vide H. Dh, vol. II. p. 588 n. 1375. The word ' amātya' occurs in the sense of minister in Ap. Dh. 8. II. 10. 25. 10 The king should not live better or more luxuriously than his gurus ( elders) and his ministers (gurūn amātyānsca nātijivet)'. The word 'gaciva' occurs in the Ait. Br. ( XII. 9) where it is said that Indra considered the Maruts as his 'sacivas' (helpers or comrades). The necessity of amatyas or sacivas is stated in graphic language by several writers. Kautilya (I. 7 last verse ) says 'kingship is possible only with ( the aid of) assistants, a single wheel cannot work ( a chariot ); therefore the king should appoint ministers and listen to their opinions'. Manu ( VII. 55 = Sukra II. 1) says it is difficult for a person single-handed to accomplish even an easy task ; how can government particularly, which has great good as its aim, be accomplished without helpers'? The Matsya-purāṇa ( 215. 2 ) prescribes the king, while his head is still wet with the waters of coronation, if he wants to supervise his State, should choose his helpers, as in the latter the kingdom secures stability. Matsya 215. 3 is the same as Manu VII. 55. Vide

Visṇudharmottara II. 24. 2-3 which are the same as Matsya 215. 2-3; also śānti 106. 11 and Rājanttiprakāśa p. 174. From Arthaśāstra I." and 8, Manu VII, 54 and 60, Kām. IV. 25, 27, XIII, 24 and 64 it appears that they use the words saciva and amātya as synonyms. Rudradāman in his Junāgadh Inscription 134 (E. I. vol. VIII. p. 36 at p. 44 ) states that his great enterprise to repair the Sudarsana lake was disapproved of by his advisory (mati-saciva) and executive councillors (karma saciva) who were all endowed with the qualities required in amātyas and yet who were averse to the project and had no enthusiasm for it, since the breach to be repaired was very great. Here sacivas are divided into two sorts, those who give advice and those who execute the business decided upon and the word baciva seems to be a synonym of amātya. Amara 185 states that the amātya who is a dhisaciva (i. e. matisaciva ) is called a mantrin, while amātyas other than the mantrin are called karmasacivas. These distinctions are often not observed. Sumantra is called amātya in Rāmāyaṇa I. 7.3 and the best of mantrins in I. 8. 4. In Ayodhya 112. 17 amatya and mantrin seem to be distinguished. From Kaut. I. 8 ( last verse ) ' Having divided the spheres of their powers and having taken into consideration the time and place and the work they have to do, all these persons should be appointed as ministers ( amātyas ), but not as mantrins,' it follows that mantrins were regarded by Kautilya as of a higher grade than amātyas in general. The R. N. P. p. 178 says that the amātyas are also styled mantrins. Kautilya states (I. 10 ) how amātyas are to be tested by upadhās i. e. by means of tempting them as regards each of dlurnu, artha, kama, and bhaya (fear) and to be employed if found honest after any one of the four tests, while mantrins were to be appoint ed only if their integrity and loyalty were proved by all the tests combined. Upadhā 138 is defined by the Nitivākyāmrta p. 111 as 'testing the mind of a person as regards dharma, artha, kama and bhaya by various devices' ( employed by secret agents). Kāt. (4-5 ) quoted by R. N. P. p. 136 states that the minds of kings always go astray on the (slightest ) cause by

reason of the fact that they possess great valour, knowledge, wealth and particularly the fact that they possess absolute power; therefore brāhmaṇas should always enlighten the mind of the king as to the duties of a king. 

About the number of members in the council of ministers there has been a great divergence of views from ancient times, Kaut. I. 15 and Kām. XI. 67-68 state that according to the Mānava school the council (pariṣad) of ministers should be constituted of twelve amātyas, acc. to the Bārhaspatyas of 16, acc. to the Auśanasas of 20, but Kautilya's own opinion was that the number is determined by the power or exigencies of the State (yathāsāmarthyam). The Bālakāpda (7. 2-3) states that Dasaratha had eight honest and devoted amatyas ( who are then named). Manu VII. 54 and Mānasollāsa (II. 2. verse 57 ) require that the king should select seven or eight ministers who should be hereditary, versed in the sāstras, brave, born of high family and well-tested. This advice was followed by Shivaji, the founder of the Maratha empire, who had a council of eight ministers (Pradhānas). Vide Ranade's 'Rise of the Maratha Power' pp. 125-126 where he describes the functions of the eight ministers called 'Mukhya-pradhana' (Prime minister)', Pant Amatya ( Finance minister), Pant Sachiva (General Accountant and Auditor), Senāpati (Commander-in chief), Mantsi (in charge of king's private affairs ), Sumanta (Foreign Secretary ), Panditrao ( in charge of the Ecclesiastical Department), Nyāyādhisha (Chief Justice ). This list was probably taken by Shivaji's advisers from the Sukranitisāra II. 71-72 where almost the same eight are said to be the ministers according to some, Vide also Grant Duff's History of the Marathas, vol. I. p. 193, and Rao Bahadur Wad's selec tions of sanads and letters ( in Marathi) published by Messrs. Mawajee and Parasnis in 1913, where the names of the eight ministers of Shivaji are stated and their duties are described (p. 123). In the Santiparva (85. 7-9) it is declared that the king should have 37 sacivas, of whom 4 should be learned and bold brāhmaṇas, 8 valiant kṣatriyas, 21 prosperous vaiśyas, 3 sūdras and one sūta versed in the Purāṇas, but Verse 11 adds that the king should discuss and settle lines of policy in the midst of eight mantrins and Santi 83. 47 says that mantrins should not be less than three. In the Rāmāyana (II 100.71 ) Rāma whom Bharata came to meet in the former's exile asks him whether he held consultation with three or four mantrins and ( in verse 18 = Sabhāparva 5. 30) Rāma hopes

that Bharata did not settle his policies by himself alone or in consultation with too many ministers. Kautilya also (I. 15) lays down that the king should hold consultation with three or four mantring. The Nitivākyāmrta (mantrisamuddeśa pp. 127-128) holds that they should be three, five or soyen, that unanimity is difficult to secure in a group of persons of different characters and that when there are many ministers they are jealous and try to carry out their own ideas. These passages show that firstly there was to be a small cabinet of three or four ministers, secondly there was to be a council ( pariṣad ) of ministers who might be eight or more in number according to requirements and thirdly there was a large number of amātyās or sacivas (high functionaries concerned with various departments ). The council is mentioned in the 3rd and 6th Rock Edicts of Asoka (Corpus I. I. vol. I. p. 4 ' parisā pi yute ājñāpayisati') in the words *the council will order the officers called Yuktas'. The qualifica tions of ministers (amātyas) are laid down in several places e. g. in Kautilya I. 9, Manu VII. 54, Yāj. I. 312. Kām. IV. 25-30 (of which verses 28-30 are almost the same as the words of Kautilya ), Santi 118. 2-3 (14 qualities of mantrins are men tioned ), Sānti 80. 25-28, Bālakāṇda 7. 7-14, Ayodhyākānda 100. 15, Medhātithi on Manu VII. 54, Agnipurāṇa 239.11-15 (= Kam. IV. 25 and 28-31 ), Mānasollāsa II. %, verses 52-59, Nitivāky āmṛta p. 108, Rājanitiratnākara pp. 13-14 ( quoting Nārada and Harita ), Rājanitiprakāśa pp. 174-178, Rājadharmakaustubha pp. 251-254, Budhabhūṣaṇa pp. 32, 57–58. Only the qualities required by Kautilya in amatya are set out here: He must be a native of the country, born of high family, influential, well trained in arts, far-sighted, wise, of good memory, vigilant, eloquent, bold, intelligent, endowed with enthusiasm and dignity, capable of endurance, pure (in mind and actions), well-disposed, firmly devoted ( to the king ), endowed with character, strength, health, spiritedness, free from arrogance and fickleness, affec tionate, who would not have recourse to hatred (even when offended by the king). Kautilya states that amātyas are of three kinds, the best, middling and inferior, of which the first must be endowed in full with the qualities set out by him and the other two are deficient by one quarter and a half respectively. In Santi 83. 35-40 the faults that disqualify a person for being a mantrin are stated and verses 41-46 set out the qualifications for'a mantrin, one of which deserves special notice, viz, ( verse 46 ) he should have secured the confidence of the pauras and jānapadas. Many works prescribe that the ministers were

to be hereditary if the son was capable like his father, e. g. Manu VII. 54, Yāj. I. 312, Rāmāyana II. 100. 26 ( = Sabhāparva 5.43 ), Agni, 220. 16-17, Sukra II. 114, The Matsya 215. 83-84 and Agnipurāna ( 220. 16-17) add the very sensible remark that such hereditary ministers should not be allowed to dispose of the cases of their dāyādas (agnates ). The Viṣnudharmottara (II. 24, 55-56 ) contains the same rule. This hereditary character is borne out by many inscriptions. For example, in the Allahabad stone pillar ing. of Samudragupta, Hariṣena is himself a Mahā. daṇda-nāyaka whose father Dhruvabhūti was also a Mahādanda nāyaka (Gupta Inscriptions pp. 10, 15 ) and in the Udayagiri cave Inscription of Candragupta II (ibid p. 34) Virasena is described as ' anvayaprāptasācivya' (who hereditarily obtained the post of saciva). The R. N.P. (p. 176) after quoting the Matsya purāṇa expressly states that the hereditary principle was to be given up, if the son or grandson of a former minister had not the requisite qualifications, but that such a descendant was to be employed only in such state work as was suited to his " attainments. The mantrins should, according to most authorities, be chosen from among brāhmanas, ksatriyas and vaisyas, but not from śūdras, even if the latter be endowed with qualities (vide Sukra II. 426-427, Nitivākyāmsta p. 108). 18a The consultation with the council of ministers was to be in secret. Kautilya (I. 15 ) says 'All administrative undertaking! must be preceded by consultation with ministers. The place for consultation should be so secluded that the conversation going on inside will not be heard outside and that even birds cannot see it, for it is narrated that secret consultations were divulged by parrots, mainas, dogs and other lower animals '. 138 The Harsacarita VI states that Nāgasena of the Nāga dynasty met destruction in Padmāvati because his secret policy was divulged

Consultations with ministers

by a mainā, Srutavarman lost his kingdom in Srāvasti as his gecret was disclosed by a parrot, and king Suvarnacūda met his death in Mșttikāyati by babbling in a dream about his policy. Vide also Manu VII. 147-150, Yāj. I. 344, Kām. XI. 53, 65-66, Agnipurāna 225. 19, Mānasollāsa II. 9, verses 700-705 p. 92. Kaut (1. 15) has a verse' no outsider should know the king's secret policy which he desires to carry out. Only those who are to carry it out should know it only when it is begun or accomplished'. Vide for a similar rule Manu VII. 105 (=śānti. 140, 24 which is also the last but one verse in Kaut. I. 15). 139 The king presided in the council, but if he was not present the chief minister presided (Manu VII. 141 ). In the Mālavikāgnimitra (V) the king's decision to make a dvairājya is conveyed to the council of ministers and then the amātya (who here means the chief minister or President of the council ) informs the king that the council agreed with the king, where upon the king asks the council to depute the commander-in chief Virasena to carry out the proposal. Kaut. further says (I. 15 ) that all business was to be transacted in the presence of the ministers ; but if any one was absent his opinion was to be elicited by despatching a letter. In matters of emergency (or great danger ) the king is to call his cabinet ministers and the council of ministers and what the majority decide or what would lead to success is to be carried out by the king. Sukra I. 365 also refers to the view of the majority. It is the duty of the ministers, according to Kām. IV. 41-49, to prevent a king from 

pursuing an evil course, it is the duty of the king to listen to the advice of his ministers and such ministers are not merely his friends but are really his gurus. "40 Sukra (II. 82-83) asks · How can the kingdom be brought to prosperity by those ministers whom the king is not afraid to offend? They are no better than ladies who are to be decked with ornaments and fine clothes. What is the use of those ministers, whose advice does not tend to the advancement of the kingdom, the people, the army, the treasury, good government and to the destruction

of enemies? The ministers, however, must have found it difficult to please the king and also to placate the subjects. A well-known subhāṣita states that one who looks to the benefit of the king comes to be hated by the people and he who looks to the good of the people (only) is abandoned by the king; when there is this great conflict it is rare to find a person who can secure the aims of both the king and the people."40x Manu (VII. 56-59) prescribes the matters in which consultations are to be held with ministers and the procedure thereof, viz. peace and war, sthāna (i. e. army, treasury, capital and the country), sources of revenue, protection (of himself and of the country), the proper bestowal of the wealth obtained; the king is to ascertain the opinions of ministers separately and then jointly and then do what is beneficial; he is then to hold consultation on the most important affairs relating to the six means of policy with a wise brāhmaṇa who is the most distinguished of all ministers and always to rely upon him, to settle all lines of policy finally on his advice and then to act. Yaj. I. 312 also requires the king to consult his mantrins, then a brāhmaṇa (purohita ) and thereafter to decide himself the course of action, The principal matters which mantrins have to concentrate them selves upon, acc. to Kām. XIII. 23-24 (=Agnipurāṇa 241. 16–18), are : mantra, securing the fruit of the line of policy adopted ( such as conquering a country and protecting it), the carrying out of the business ( of the State ), predicting the good or evil effects (of an action taken), revenue and expenditure, govern ment (i. e. punishing those who deserve punishment), subduing enemies, measures against calamities like famine, guarding the king and the kingdom. \\ The Nītivākyāmṛta (p. 185) concisely puts the same by saying that amātyas have to concern them selves with revenue, expenditure, guarding the ruler (i. e. his body, his dharma, wife and children ), looking after the army in all its arms. 

Yāj. I. 343 says since the State depends upon mantra (i. e. lines of policy arrived at after consultation with ministers), the

king should keep his lines of policy secret in such a way that people should not know them till the results of his undertakings manifest themselves'. Kautilya (X. 6 last verse ) emphasizes the importance of mantra in 'an arrow discharged by an archer may kill one man or none at all, but a ( well-considered) scheme put into operation by a wise man may destroy even those who are only conceived'. 142 Both Sabhāparva 5. 27 and Ayodhyā 100. 16 have the same verse, viz. mantra is the root of victory.16 Kautilya and the Nitivākyāmsta p. 114 say that mantra accomplishes the following, viz. the apprehension of what is not or cannot be seen, imparting the strength of definite conclusion to what is apprehended, removal of doubt when two courses or opinions are possible, inference of an entire matter when only a part is seen." In most works such as Kauṭ. I. 15, Kām. XI. 56, Agnipurāna 241, 4, Pancatantra I. p. 85, Mānasollāsa (II. 9 verse 697 ff, p. 92 ) it is said that mantra has five elements which have to be considered (it is pancanga), viz, means of carrying out actions (or works), plenty of men and materials, proper allotment of time and place, remedies against pitfalls, the ( happiness of the kingdom or people ) that will result from the accomplishment of the course decided upon. 145 

The high functionaries and office-holders have been different at different times. In the Vedic age, in the performance of the Rājasūya, there are certain offerings (generally twelve in number) which are called 'ratninām havimṣi'. Their order and names differ in different texts, though most are the same in all. Besides the king (the sacrificer), the eleven 'ratnas' ( jewels ) or 'ratnins' are (according to the Sat. Br. V. 3. 2). the commander-in-chief, the purohita, the crowned queen, sūta grāmaṇi, kṣatıṣ (chamberlain), sangrahit? (treasurer or charioteer?),

II. p. 1215 n and 1216. In Tai. Br. (1.7.3) they are the same as above except that govikartana is omitted and the queen called

V. 3. 2. 2 and 4 that some of these jewels like the commander-in-chief and the huntsman were of low caste or of the sūdra caste. Later on certain functionaries began to be called tirthas, their number being 18; vide Sabhāparva 5. 38 ( –Ayodhya 100, 36 ) and Sānti 69.52 for a reference to the 18 tirthas. 148 Kautilya (I. 12 ) speaks of the 18 tirthas and enumerates them. 17 In the Raghuvamsa 17.68 Kālidāsa employs the word tirtha in this sense. According to the Nitivākyāmsta (p. 29 ) persons who are helpers in dharma and state business are called tirtha. In the Edicts of Asoka the high officers were called mahāmātras ( in Rock Edict XII there are dharma-mahāmātras ) and other officers were yuktas, rājukas and prādesikas (in Rock Edict III) of whom the first at least were subordinate to the council of ministers.

on the Yasastilaka I. p. 91 differ as to the names of these 18. 148 The Rājatarangiṇi I. 120 informs us that in former times there were only seven departments ( karmasthānas ), that later on they became 18 and that five more were added to these eighteen (IV. 142-143 and 512) viz. mahāpratihāra, mahāsāndhivigraha, mahāśvaśāla, mahābhāndāgāra, mahāsādhanabhāga (and so the Heads were called 'adhigata-pañcamahāśabda' i. e. to whom five titles with 'mahā' in them were given). "9 The Agni purāṇa 220 mentions several high functionaries like the senāpati, pratihāra, dūta and heads of departments. The Sukra nitisāra ( II. 69-70 ) enumerates ten principal high functionaries of the king (prakṛtis ) viz. purodhas (purohita), pratinidhi, pradhāna ( President of council ), saciva (war minister), mantrin ( Home minister), prādvivāka (minister of justice ), pandita (minister of ecclesiastical matters), sumantra (Finance minister), amātya (revenue minister) and dūta (minister of diplomatic relations ) and remarks that others omitted purodhas and data from this list of ten and held that these eight should all receive the same pay ( verses 71-72), while śukra was of opinion that the ten high dignitaries should each receive in order one tenth more as pay than the succeeding one ( v. 71 ), that the purohita was the most eminent of all, that among the rest each preceding was more eminent than each succeeding one ( 11. 74-77), that after these high dignitaries came the other officers (adhikārigana, II. 279), that then came the darśaka ( secretary?), and lekhaka ( clerk), then the menial servants who waited on the king and lastly the lowest were those who carried out dirty work, In II. 84-87 Sukra briefly brings out the special functions of the

XII P: 157, while in an Inscription from Yewur of about 1040 A. D. it is applied to a mabāmandalesvara (E. I. vol. XII. p. 269). In the Pimpari plates of Dhārāvarsa Dhruvarāja dated Sake 697 the same title is applied to a minister described as Agafarer FUATA (E. I, vol. X. p. 89). Vide J BBRAS (New series) vol. I pp. 238-245, VII. 487, VIII. 93 for discussion.

ministers from pratinidhi to dūta 150 and then in II. 88-105 at length. In 1. 353-361 Sukra lays down how the king's public durbar should be arranged, viz. the king's throne should be in the centre of the western half of the hall on which the king should sit well-dressed, wearing his crown, armour and a drawn sword; his sons, grandsons, brother's and sister's sons should sit behind him, his daughter's sons should sit on his right and on his left should sit in order his uncles, chief agnates, members of the assembly, commanders ; in front of the king to his right should be seated his maternal grandfather's relatives, the man trins, and to the left his father-in-law, wife's brother, officers &c. The Sukranitisāra ( I. 374-376 ) lays down certain very practical rules for the king :'he should personally observe villages, towns and districts every year; he should see whether his subjects are kept contented or are harassed by his officers, he should not side with the officers (with the man on the spot ) but rather should take the side of the subjects, he should remove an officer who is hateful to many (lit, a hundred ) people and an amūtya should be removed if he is found to commit several illegal acts. Sukra ( in II. 107-113 ) further advises the change of portfolios among the ministers (e. 8. sumantra should be appointed amatya or vice versa); he says that for each department three should be engaged, one the most clever being the head and two others being darsakas (secretaries ) who should be changed every thrée, five, seven or ten years; one man should not be allowed to hold the same high office for a long time, since otherwise he becomes intoxicated with power; 181 servants should not do any business without a written order nor should a king order any thing to be done except in writing (II. 290 ).

officers every five years. The 6th caste mentioned by Megas thenes (Fragment 1 p. 41 and Fragment XXXIII p. 85 in McCrindle's 'Ancient India') was that of overseers who inquired into and superintended all that went on in India, and made reports to the king or, where there was no king, to the magistrate Megasthenes probably confounded the ministers and adhyaksas ( who were often hereditary ) with a caste. Vide also Fragment XXXIV pp. 86-88 about the officers of state and their duties. It is probably on account of some such rule as is stated in Sukra about frequent change of portfolios that in the inscriptions high functionaries have epithets prefixed to them which indicate their connection with several portfolios e. g. in the Bangkhera plate of Emperor Harsa ( E. I. vol. IV p. 208 at p. 211) Skanda gupta ( who is probably the same as the Skandagupta mentioned by Bāṇa in the Harsacarita VI as commander of the elephant arm) was the dūlaka of the grant and is described as' mahāpramātāra mahāsāmanta'; in the Allahabad stone pillar Ing. of Emperor Samudragupta (Gupta Inscriptions p. 10 and p. 15 n. 4), Hariṣeṇa is described as 'Sāndhivigrahika'( minister for peace and war ), Kumārāmātya'(the minister of the Yuvarāja ?) and Mahā-danda nāyaka 158 ( commander of an army); Pșthyisena ( a brāhmana) is described as mantrin, kumārāmātya and then mahābalā dhiksta (in E. I. vol. X p. 72, of Gupta Samvat 117). In theory and practice the king was to issue orders in the presence or under the advice of his principal ministers. We read in the grant of Rājarāja I of the Eastern Cālukya dynasty that he issued his command in the presence of the mantrin, purohita, senā pati, yuvarāja, dauvārika and pradhāna (E. I vol. IV. p. 300 at p. 302 ). Sukra (II. 362-370 ) describes the procedure followed in issuing orders about State business. First the mantrin, prādvivāka (Chief Judge), pandita (head of ecclesiastical department ), and dūta should write out the business relating to their departments, then the amātya should write thereon ( sādhu likhanam-asti, the writing is good), sumantra adds samyag vicaritam' (it is well considered ), the pradhāna writes 'satyam yathārtham" (it is the truth, it is as the business requires ), pratinidhi should write 'angikartuin yogyam' (it is proper to accept this ), the yuvarāja should write 'angikartavyam' ( it should be accepted ), the purohita should write "lekhyam svā. 

152. 'Mahādandanāyaka' may mean the chief minister ' as Manu VII. 65 states 'on the amātya depends the control (of the govero meot) and discipline (among subjects) depends on control (danda).'

bhimatam' (this writing is approved by me); all then should make their seals after their remarks and then the king should write angikstam'188 ( it is accepted) and affix his soal. 

The Rājatarangipi shows that persons often rose to ministe rial positions from low birth e. g. (V. 73) it states that an engineer of Avantivarman was a foundling, ( VII. 207) a watch man became chief minister. 

It is necessary to say a few words about some of the great officers of State. First comes the Yuvarāja. Kautilya devotes one chapter (I. 17 ) to taking care of the prince. The subjects of the prince's education, his association with state business, treatment of princes, good or bad, the coronation of a yuvarāja have already been dealt with (pp. 49, 83 &c.). The younger brother or eldest son was made yuvarāja ( Crown Prince ) during the reigning king's life ( Ayodhyā, chap. 3-6, Kām. VII. 6, Sukra II. 14-16). Rāma on his coronation as king made Bharata the Crown Prince when Lakṣmaṇa refused to be so (Yuddha 131.93). The yuvarāja and princes were often sent as governors of different parts of the realm. The Divyāvadāna ( XXVI. p. 371 ) states that Asoka was sent by his father Bindusāra to Takṣaśila to pacify popular disturbances and Emperor Asoka himself is said to have sent his son Kunāla from Pataliputra to the same town to pacify the citizens that had been offended by the arrogance of the amātyas (ibid. pp. 407-8). Khāravela in the Hāthigumphā Ins. ( E. I. vol. XX at pp. 79, 86) was a yuvarāja for nine years from his 16th to his 24th year. From the Mālavikāgnimitra we learn that while Pusyamitra was virtual emperor of Bharatavarṣa his son Agnimitra was ruling at Vidika and had the authority to divide the kingdom of Berar betweon two brothers, Yajñasena and Mādhavasena. The yuvarāja is not generally enumerated in the lists of mantrins, but he is one of the 18 tirthas and from Sukra ( above p. 115) it appears that he had a seal and important matters passed through his hands along with those of the ministers. According 14 to 

153. Compare the word "drstam' occurring at the beginning of Chammak and Sivani grants of the Vākāṭaka emperor Pravarasena II and the same word in the plate of the Pallava kiog Sivaskandavarman (in E. I. vol. I. at p. 9). In most plates of the Vākāļakas the word 'drstan'occurs at the beginning; vide E. I. vol. 22 p. 167.

The Yuvarāja and the State 

117 

Sukra ( II. 12 ) the yuvarāja and the group of amātyas are the two arms or eyes of the king, but Sukra V. 17 warns the king against transferring all power to the Crown Prince except when the king is about to die. The Matsyapurāṇa 220.7 quoted in the Budhabhūṣaṇa (p. 33) prescribes that the king should entrust to the well-disciplined prince at first unimportant offices and then gradually important ones. 185 If a prince was ill-behaved he was not to be abandoned as he would go over to the enemies and harm the king, but he should be kept confined in a guarded place ( Kām. VII. 6, Budhabhūsana pp. 33, 35, verses 77, 93). As regards his emoluments he was placed on the same footing as the mantrin, purohita, senāpati, the queen, the king's mother (Kaut. V. 3). What office is meant by the Kumārāmatya in some of the Inscriptions ( e. g. Gupta Ing. pp. 10, 50, E. I. vol. X p. 72, E. I. vol. XI. p. 83 ) is not clear. It does not probably mean 'a royal prince who was also an amātya', but rather some minister attached to the yuvarāja, as contradistinguished from rājāmātya (which office occurs in Gupta Inscriptions, p. 218). It appears that in ancient times provincial governors could be total strangers to the royal family. From Rudradāman's Junagadh Ing. we learn that the governor of Surāṣtra under Candragupta Maurya was a vaisya called Puṣyagupta and under Aśoka a Yavana noble or king called Tuṣāspa "Sa (E. I. VIII p. 36 at p. 43). 

Next comes the purohitu. In H. Dh. vol. II pp. 40 and 363 it has been already shown how purohitas existed from the most ancient period of the Rgveda, how the purohita was thought to be half the soul of the king and how the co-operation of the spiritual teacher and the secular head ( the king ) was deemed absolutely necessary for the prosperity of the kingdom, how Gautama (XI. 12-14) and Āp. Dh, S. II. 5. 10. 16 prescribed the qualities of the purohita. Our authorities show that the purohita was not a mere priest. The Ait. Br. ( 40.2 ) calls the purohita *rāṣtragopa '( the saviour of the kingdom ). The Sukraniti also, 

155. S tig Farratei TFTOT I et for ma: T FRONTY HETFOTO \# ARET 220. 7, qu. p. 33 

155a. It is strange that Dr. Beni Prasad in 'The State in ancient India' (p. 189) remarks "the former governor is designated rastriya while the latter is called adhisthūya". "Adhisthaya' in Rudradāman's Ins. is only a gerund of sthā' with "adbi' and means 'having ruled over '. राष्ट्रिय is formed from रा according to राहावारपाराह यसो (Pan. IV. 2.93) and means 'one ruling over a proviące, a Provincial Governor'. Ia dramas a means ' king's brother-in-law'. Kpirasvāni says' Arograma El

118 

History of Dharmasastra 

(Vol. 

though a very late work, similarly describes the purohita (II. 74 ) as "rājarāstrabhrt' (the supporter of the king and the kingdom). In the Rgveda III. 53. 12 we find the idea that the hymns and the spiritual power of the purohita Visvāmitra protected the Bharata clan. 156 He made the king ready for battle and accompanied him in battle murmuring where the arrows fly &c'. (Rg. VI. 75.17) while the fight went on (vide Aøv. Gr. III. 12. 19 quoted below n. 308). The Viṣnudharmasūtra HI. 70, Yāj. I. 313, Kām. IV. 32 require that the purohita was to be well versed '57 in the vedas, itihāsa, dharmaśāstra or danda niti, in astrology and portents, in rites of propitiation contained in the Atharvaveda, of high family, endowed with all vidyās and good acts as stated in the śāstras and with austerities. Kaut. (I. 9) states almost the same qualifications for the purohita, requires the king to honour his advice as a pupil honours his teacher or a son his father or a servant his master and says that royal power advanced by brāhmaṇas, enforced as with a spell by the consultations of mantrins and endowed as with a weapon by the observance of śāstric rules becomes invincible and secures success. Vide Adi. 170.74-75, 174. 14-15, śānti. 72. 2-18 and chap. 73, Rājanltiprakāśa pp. 59-61 and 136-137, Rāja" dharma-kaustubha pp. 255-257 for qualifications expected in the purohita. Kautilya (X. 3) states that while a battle is going on the chief ) minister and purohita should urge on and encourage the soldiers by exhorting them with verses from the Veda and classical Sanskrit, promising great rewards in the next world for those who fall in battle. The Sukranitisāra ( II. 78-80 ) requires in the purohita among other qualities the study of dhanurveda, proficiency in arms and in formations of armies for battle and possession of so much religious merit as to be able to pronounce an effective curse. A purohita was to be distinguished from a stuj (a sacrificial priest) as Manu VII. 78 and Yaj. I. 314 show. Vide Mānasollāsa II. %. 60 (p. 34), Rājanitiratnākara pp. 16-17, Vispudharmottara II. 5., Agni 239. 16-17 for further passages on purohita. Some authorities include

the purohita among amatyas or mantrins (e. g. Vijñāneśvara on Yāj. I. 353, Sukra II. 69-70), while others like Yāj. I. 312 regard him as distinct from mantring. The purohita was often hereditary. Acc. to Kautilya quoted above he was to employ means declared in the Atharvaveda to remove calamities, divine and human. The great divine calamities acc. to Kautilya IV. 3 are fire, flood, disease, famine, rats, wild elephants, snakes and evil spirits, 158 According to Manu VII. 78 the purohita was concerned with the religious rites laid down in the srauta and grhya sūtras and Ap. II. 5. 10. 14-17 show that the purohita had complete jurisdiction in matters of penance for offences. Vas. ( 19. 40-42 ) provides that if the king lets off an offender deserving to be punished the king had to fast for a day and the purohita for three days and to perform the heavy penance of Krcchra if the king punished the innocent. According to most authorities he played a role that was pre-eminently religious. He is not mentioned among the 10 limbs of the sabhā in the administration of justice. Kāt. 24 (quoted in S. V. p. 20) does not require him to be an expert in arthaśāstra, though Kāt. 56 quoted by the Mit, on Yāj. II. % and Sm, C. (II. p. 14) say that the king should enter the Hall of Justice with learned brāhmaṇas, the ministers, the chief justice, the purohita &c. Yāj. I. 31% and the Mit. on Yāj. I. 312-313 on the other hand prescribe that even after consulting all mantrins, the king was finally to consult the purohita in all secular and religious matters. The Nitivākyāmrta (purohitasamuddeśa ) p. 160 states that the divine calamities are: shower of fire (fall of lightning?), excessive rainfall, epidemics, famine, damage or disease of crops, swarms of locusts and other vermin, diseases, goblins and female evil spirits, snakes, wild elephants, rats. The purohita is required to know ritual of five kinds, '59 viz. that dealing with the propitiation of Nakṣatras, that of śrauta sacrifices, that of the sainhitās ( of Tantra worship ), that of Atharvasiras and that of

śāntis ( such as grahaśānti &c.). Calamities, according to Kām. XIII. 20-21, are of two sorts, divine ( daiva ) and human : there are five kinds of the first viz. fire, flood, disease, famine and epidemic, all of which can be met by human effort and by propitiatory rites, while human calamities should be withstood by constant effort and by proper lines of policy. The same verses are Agnipurāṇa 241. 14-16. 

Acc. to Kautilya (V.3) 48000 panas were the salary of the (royal) sacrificial priest, ācārya (teacher), mantrin, purohita, commander in-chief, crown prince, the king's mother, the queens and he holds that "with that amount of maintenance they would not yield to temptation or revolt (against the king)",180 The amatyas, the chief judge and even the purohita could be punished by the king, acc. to Manu, if any of them went wrong (VIII. 335 and IX. 234) and Kaut (IX. 3) prescribes that when the purohita is guilty even of a great offence, the remedy is to imprison him or banish him. Some great ministers, though not exactly purohitas of the king, were learned brāhmaṇas and led simple lives such as Cānakya and Madhava. There is divergence of views about the salaries set out in the Arthaśāstra (V. 3). Jayaswal ( in Hindu Polity' part II p. 136 ) holds that the salaries were yearly and the paṇas in which they were paid were silver ones. Prof. Dikshitar (in * Mauryan Polity' p. 151 ) holds that the salaries were monthly. Confusion is caused by the fact that there were paṇas of copper, silver and gold. Vide Rājanitiprakāda p. 294. The Rājatarangini VII. 950 speaks of dinnāras of gold, silver and copper. Rao Bahadur K. V, Rangaswami Aiyangar holds that the salaries (in the Arthasāstra ) were monthly and in golden paṇas (in Ancient Indian Polity' pp. 44-45). Therefore this matter must be investigated. Manu (VIII. 13) promises that those names of copper, silver and gold coins which are well-known among the people (of its day) for purposes of trade will be described by him. Acc. to Manu VIII. 134 and 136, Viṣṇu Dh. S. IV. 6-10, and Yaj. I. 363-365 five krṣpalas are equal to a māṣa, 16 māṣas are equal to a suvarna, 4 suvarnas ( or five aco. to some ) are equal to a pala, a karṣa is equal to of a pala and a piece of copper one-fourth of a pala in weight is called a papa, which is the same as kārṣāpaṇa 16' ( equal to 80 raktikūs or

guñjā berries). A pala was equal to 320 raktikās. Kaut. II. 19 says practically the same thing. In Kaut. V. 3 the salaries range from 48000 to 60 paṇas from the highest functionaries to the lowest servants. They must all be taken to be for the same period in every case and in the same metal, since Kaug. expressly states no different periods and no difference in metal. Ordinarily the words pana and karṣāpaṇa ( as stated by Manu VIII. 136 and the Mit. on Yāj. I. 365 and the Sukraniti IV. 1. 116 ) refer to copper pieces ( used as coins ) and bearing a stamp. Another table given by Manu VIII. 135-136, Viṣnu Dh. S. VI. 11-12, Yāj. I. 364 is : 2 raktikās 10% or kropalas = one (silver ) māṣa, 16 māsas \#one 

162. A raktikā was found by General Cunningham after many experi ments to weigh on an average 1.8 grains (vide his 'Coins of Ancient India' pp. 45-46 and also Rapson's 'Coins' pp. 2-3). So that a silver dbarana or purāna ( of 32 raktikās) should weigh about 57. 6 grains and a copper pana (of 80 raktikās) should weigh 144 grains. It appears that the weights of Indian coins in different parts and at different times varied a good deal. Cunningham (Coins of Ancient India' p. 5) states that gold was cheap in India, being as one to eight rates of silver. But in medieval times i. e. about 1300 A. D. (vide Sukra IV. 2. 92-93 ) gold was 16 times the price of the same weight of silver, which again was 80 times of the price of the same weight of copper. Though, as stated in note 161 above, a copper pana was usually equal to eighty raktikas, a copper pana of 100 raktikās (i, e, of 20 māṣas) was known. Nār. (parisista verse 58) speaks of musa as the 20th part of the kārṣāpaṇa and the Mit. on Yaj. I. 365 and Vy. Nirnaya p. 207 quote a verse (attributed to Usapas by Haradatta and Maskaria on Gaut. XII. 19 ) that a māsa is a twentieth part of paṇa (ATT SITHA \#T: COFFY Trattaa:). The Agaipurāna ( 227. 2) appears to have known a pana of 120 kronalas (Fotorat aur HUT TN \# Strana). The verses in Nār. (parisista 58-60) are ascribed to Kāt, by the Sm. C. II. p. 99 and it is stated by both that those terms are in vogue in Pañcanada (Punjab). When the pana of copper was equal to 20 māsas (and 100 gunijās), the copper coin would have been almost of the weight of the modern copper half anna coin, The table given by Nār. ( pari, 58-60) is: 4 kākinis- māsa, 20 māṣas=kārśāpana (which is the same as Andikā ), 4 kārsāpanas dhānaka, 12 dhānakas = suvarna (also called dināra). The table giveo by Br. (as quoted in Sm. C. II p. 99 and V. R. p. 667) is the same. Bș, as quoted by Aparārka p. 832 and V. R. p. 111 employs the word 'nāṇaka' for coin, which word also occurs in the Mṛcchakaṭika and in Vāj. II. 240-241. The Amarakośa states that niska and dināra are synonyms and also gives other meanings of niṣka. Sabara on Jai, IV, 3.39 gives the striking example no one would spend a kārsā pana for finding out a kākini that he had lost', The Arthasastra II. 12 p. 84 states that the superintendent of the mint should manufacture copper panas, half panas, kākiṇis and half kākinis. The Viṣnu Dh. S. V. 96 refers to a golden

silver purāna or dharana ; 10 dharaṇas=one (silver) satamāna. This table was used for silver coins. Thus a dharana would be 1/10th of a pala as stated in the Brhatsamhita ( 10. 13 palada 

(Continued from last page) māsaka. Under the Guptas golden coins are mentioned as dināras; vide "Gupta Inscriptions'p, 29 at p. 31 where there is a gift of 25 dināras in the Gupta year 93 and pp. 38, 41, 261 ( where it is stated that one bhikṣu was to be fed every day throughout the year from the permanent endowment of 12 dināras). From the Baigram plate dated Gupta samvat 128 it appears that one dinara was equal to 16 rūpakas (silver coins) in E. I. vol. XXI. p. 80. A Mathurā las. of the 28th year of Huviska speaks of the deposit of 550 purānas (E. I. vol. XXI. p. 55 at 61). Bhaskarācārya ( who was born in sake 1036 and wrote his Siddhāntasiromani in 1072 sake i. e. 1150 A. D.) gives the following table (in Lilāvati I. 2-4): 20 varāṭakas = kākini, 4 kākinis - pana. 16 panas - dramma, 16 drammas = niska; 2 yavas = guñjā, 3 guājās = valla (modern Marathi vāl), 8 vallas - dharana, 2 dharanas = gadyānaka ; 5 guñjās = māsa, 16 māsas = karsa, 4 karṣas = pala and a karṣa of gold is called Suvarna. It will be seen that Nār, and Lilavati differ as to ITFOTT. Gadyāṇakas of gold are referred to in the Pattadakal pillar Ins. of Kirtivar man I (754 A. D.), where it is stated that a field of 30 nivartanas was purchased for thirty gadyanakas of gold (E. I, vol. III, pp. 6–7). From a verge of the Caturvimsatimata quoted by the Mit. on Yaj. III. 258 it appears that gadyānaka was also a silver coin. From an inscription of Vikramaditya V near Gadag dated sake 934 it appears that fines for offences were levied in gadyanakas (E. I. vol. XX p. 64). The following works may be consulted for further information on Indian coins viz. Cunningham's 'Coins of Ancient India' (1894), Rapson's 'Indian coins' (1897) in the Grundriss, C. J. Brown's Coins of India' (in the Heritage of India' series, 1922). The Dharmadvaitanirnaya (pp. 137-139) and the Vaijayanti on Viṣnu Dh. S. IV, 9 may be consulted for efforts to reconcile the various statements about Suvarna, Niṣka &c, For an informing paper on the most ancient Denarii, vide Proceedings of the British Academy vol.XVIII pp.211-266 where it is established that the earliest denarius period begins about 187 B. C. Therefore Jolly's assumption (in Recht und Sitte p. 23 followed by Winternitz in 'History of Indian Literaturo' val, II. p. 216. 0, 4 that all Indian works in which the word dināra occurs cannot have been composed before and century A. D. is unwarranted. Prof. Keith (JRAS for 1915. p. 504) does not accept Jolly's assumption. The dināra was variously defined. According to Visṇugupta quoted in Hemadri's Vratakhanda, a rūpaka is oth of suvarna and a dināra was equal to 28 rūpakas, while ace, to Nār. aad Kāt. But and fare were synonyms. The Dharmadvaitanirnaya says that a kārsāpaña ( of silver it seems ) was equal to eight or ten dhabbukas. One of the verses of the Jūāpesvarī (composed in 1290 A, D.) that speaks of gold as tu* (15 times ia price of the same weight of silver ) may be cited here are proti vi muatot. * 1 (v. 1. \#T) fageti chap 17 verse 322 (Bhide's and Madgavkar's editions),

sabhāgo dharanam). Nārada (pariṭiṣta 57 ) expressly states that a silver kārṣāpaṇa is in vogue in the south i. e. a silver pana or kārṣāpaṇa was not universal. 16 A golden suvarna also comprised 80 guñjas, while the standard silver paṇa was of 32. Rhys Davids ( in Buddhist India'p. 100 ) states that about the time of Buddha's birth transactions were carried on in terms of the kahāpana, a square copper coin weighing about 144 grains and guaranteed as to weight and fineness by punch marks made by private individuals, that there were half and quarter kaha panas also, that a kahāpana would be now worth about fths of a penny, though its purchasing power was then equal to about one shilling of the present day. Therefore it is proper to under stand that a paṇa or kārṣāpaṇa, when the word is used without any qualification, was meant to be one of copper and that prima facie the salaries in Kautilya were meant to be in copper panas. This conclusion oan be supported by various considera tions. Manu VII. 126 prescribes that the wages for the lowest menial servant ( such as one who sweeps the house or brings water) is one pana a day and of a superior menial servant 6 paṇas a day and that the former was to get in addition one pair of garments every six months and every month a drona of corn (which would be equal to 1024 mustis according to the Mit. on Yāj. III. 274). Whatever ages may be assigned to the Arthaśāstra and the present Manusmfti the two works cannot be separated from each other, if at all, by more than a century or two. Therefore the economic conditions of the one may be held to have not differed much from those to which the other refers. It is impossible to hold that the lowest menial servant got one gold paṇa a day besides over 30 muṣtis of corn every day (1024 in a month). If that were so, the lowest menial servants of Kautilya's days would have to be supposed to be a hundred times better off than their confreres in big cities like Bombay towards the end of the 19th century ( when menial servants got from five to ten rupees a month without any allowance of grain ). Therefore the pana in Kautilya V. 3 is not of gold. Kautilya (in V. 3) says that a king who has a depleted treasury may make payment of salary by giving forest produce, cattle or fields along with small guantities of cash, that if he has under taken to colonize a waste tract he may make payment of salary in cash only and not by bestowing a village.

with this he says that 60 panas are to be the equivalent of one adhaka of corn (ṣaṣṭivetanasyadhakam krtvā hiraṇyānurūpam bhaktam kuryat). An adhaka 165 came to only 256 muṣtis (handfuls) of corn and even in famine times one adhaka could not have cost 60 silver paṇas, much less golden ones. In V. 3 Kautilya declares that an ordinary dūta should get ten panas for a journey of one yojana and twice the wages for each yojana up to one hundred. A yojana acc. to Kaut himself (II. 20 ) is equal to 8000 dhanus ( acc. to another reading 4000 dhanus ), a dhanus being equal to four aratnis (each aratni being 24 angulas ). So taking the highest figure a yojana was at the

When Kautilya says that the king may pay. biranya' and not 'grāma' be means only cash payment and not necessarily only gold i vide the copperplate grant of Siladitya VII in Gupta Inscriptions p. 179 at p. 189 where the grant of a village is said to be sadhāngahiranyādeyah'. Here dhūnya (payment of tax in kind) is contradistinguished from payment in hiranya i, e, in cash (either gold, silver or copper). When Patañjali states that the Mauryas being greedy of 'biranya ' founded or manufactured images (Mahābhāṣya vol. II. p. 429 on Pāṇ. V. 3. 99 quoted in H. Dh. vol. II p. 710 n. 1696 ) what is meant is that they wanted casb and not merely gold, 

165. The measures of capacity such as 376. Sper occur in the Mat. hura Ins, of Huviska (E. I. XXI. p. 55 at p. 61 ). According to Parāśara (VI. 70 ) two prasthas are equal to an adhaka and 32 prasthas are equal to a drona. The Mit. on Yāj. III. 275 quotes a verse to this effect: 8 mustis = one kifcit or kufici (acc. to some ), 8 kincit = puskala, 4 puṣkalas = adhaka; 4 adhakas = drona and 16 dronas - khāri. Aparārka (pp. 305 and 846 ) quotes two verses (which the Par. M. II 1, p. 141 ascribes to the Bhavisya. purāna) which say: 2 palas = prasști, 2 prasstis kudava, 4 kudavas = prastha, 4 prasthas * adhaka, 4 adhakas = drona. 2 dronas = kumbha. The Danda. viveka p. 135 refers to this, adds that some held the kumbha to be equal to 20 dronas (Kauṭ. II, 20 holds kumbha to be equal to 20 dronas ) and quotes the following verse from quingelorector: OTTATHN: 8:1 Gut fūr unter FA:' H. The word drona occurs even in the Rgveda in the sense of a wooden trough used for holding water or soma juice. Vide Rg. VI. 2,8, VI, 37.2. VI, 44,20, IX. 28,4 etc. In Rg. IV. 32. 17 the sage prays Indra to grant a hundred khāris of soma. The words ūdhaka and drona occur in the ardbarcadi group (Pān. II. 4. 31), Khari ia Pāṇ, V 1. 33 and V. 4. 101. The Par. M. II. 1. 141 says on this difference about kumbha . $10 TET TUTTATTETE.' Kaut. (II. 19 p. 104 ) himself tells us that the measure drona was of four varieties, 162; palas, 175, 187} or 200 palas according as it was used for measurement in the barem, or for servants or for ordinary dealings or for royal income,

most about 9 or 10 miles (or only 4} or five miles according to the other reading). To hold that 10 silver panas were allowed to an ordinary data for going even ten miles (which he could cover in half a day or less ) would be too much. Hence also the paṇas in Kaut. V. 3 are only copper ones. When once it is settled that the paṇas are of copper, it easily follows that the salaries in papas were monthly. Artisans and craftsmen were, acc. to Kaut., to get 120 panas. If this were yearly, they would get only 10 paṇas a month, while, according to Manu quoted above, even the lowest menial was to get a papa a day. Therefore 120 papas (of copper ) were the monthly salary of an artisan. A monthly salary is more natural and practical than a yearly one. Other ancient writers like Saṅkha-Likhita ( in Rājanitiprakasa p. 252 ) contemplate a monthly salary for soldiers (viz. two suvarpas a month ). 166 From the Nasik Inscription No. 12 (E. I.

A few words may be said about words like suvarna, satamāna, niska &c. The word krsnala occurs in the Tai. S II. 3. 2 1. Hiranyakāra ( goldsmith) is found in Vāj, S, 30. 17. In Rg. I. 126, 2 gifts of a hundred niskas and horses are mentioned and in Rg. IV. 37. 4 the Rbhus are address. ed as wearing 'good niskas'. In Atharva V. 14. 3 'niska' occurs and in the Ait. Br. (39.8) damsels who are niskakanthyah ( whose necks are adorn ed with necklaces of niskas) are among the gifts. So'niska' was probably a gold piece used as a coin or an ornament or a thin plate of gold like a modern putli, several of which are even now worn by women in the form of a necklace. In Rg. II. 33. 10 Rudra is said to wear 'visvarūpa-niska' which is probably an allusion to golden pieces stamped with various figures. In Rg. VI. 47. 23 the sage says that he received ten 'biranyapindas' (golden pieces ) from Divodāsa. In æg. VIII. 78. 2 a prayer is offered to Indra for the bestowal of golden. mana', which may be the precursor of Satamāna'. This last occurs in the Tai. S. VI. 6. 10. 2. Pan. (V. 1.27, 29, 30 ) respective ly mentions satamana ( what is bought for a satamāna is called sātamāna ), kārsāpana, niska and V. I. 34 refers to pana, pāda and māsa. Patañjali ( Mahābhāṣya vol.

Hopkins in 'Position of the ruling caste' J, A, 0. S. vol. XIII. pp. 151-162 traces how the influence of the purohita grew. One cannot accept his views about there being three layers in the Mahābhārata and the conclusions from such dealing with the text that he draws, which are rather subjective, Gradually the importance of the purohita waned. As the Sukranitisāra cited above ( n. 150 ) shows, long before that work he came to be omitted by several writers from the council of ministers and was supplanted by the Pandita. The same func tions came to be exercised by an officer called dharmādhyaksa or dharmādhikaranika in Bengal and other countries. The Matsyapurāna ( 215.24) states the qualifications of a dharmadhi kūrin. 187 Vide E. I. vol. 14 p. 156 at p. 160 of the Naihati grant of Ballālasena, where we have both purohita and mahā dharmādhyaksa mentioned among the great functionaries of State and the Benares copper-plate of the Cedi king Karnadeva in 1042 A. D. in E. I vol. II, p. 309 where we have mahādharmādhi. karaṇika but no purohita. Besides another officer called sāmvatsara ( astrologer ) gradually took over some of the functions of the purohita. The Viṣnudharmasūtra II. 75 (rājā ca sarvakāryeṣu samvatsarādhinah syāt) requires the king to depend on the sāṁvatsara in all matters. The Bphat-samhitā (2.9) states that a king without a sāmvatsara mistakes his path like a blind man. Kām. 4.33 and Visṇudharmottara II. 4. 5-16 recom mend reliance on him. Kautilya 17a IX, 4 was himself against too much reliance on astrology, while Yāj. I. 307 holds that the rise and fall of kings depend on the (aspects or influence of) planets.

Senāpati 

127 

Senūpati : The qualities of a commander-in-chief are stated in several places such as Kautilya (II. 33), Ayodhyā 100.30 (= Sabhā 5. 46 ), Santi 85, 31-32, Matsya 215. 8-10, Agnipurāna 220. 1 ff, Kām. XVIII. 27-44, Viṣnudharmottara II. 24. 4-6, Mānasollasa II. %, verses 90-92 p. 37. Acc. to the Agni purāṇa 220. 1, Matsya 215. 10 the commander-in-chief must be either a brāhmana or a kṣatriya. Sukra ( II. 429-430 ) requires that a ksatriya should be preferred as senapati, but if a valiant kṣatriya be not available a brāhmaṇa may be chosen, but a $ūdra should not be chosen. Acc. to the Mānasollāsa he should possess the following qualities : good family, character, courage, proficiency in (several) languages, cleverness in riding horses and elephants and in the science of arms, knowledge of omens and medicine, knowledge of the breeds of horses and of the difference between what is essential and non essential, liberality, sweet speech, self-control, intelligence, resoluteness. In the Mahābhārata senāpatis are elected and consecrated (vide Udyoga 151, Drona 5, Karna 10), but this was not so in later times. He is appointed by the king on his own initiative. 

Dūla : ( Ambassador or messenger). The word and the office of data as messenger was known in the most ancient times. In Rg. I. 12.1, 1.161.3, VIII. 44.3 Agni is said to be the dūta and is requested to bring the gods to the sacrifice. There is also attached to the word the meaning of espionage, since Saramā, the bitch of the gods, is represented in Rg. X. 108. 2-4 as sent by Indra to find out the treasures of the Panis. The Udyogaparva (37.27, cr. ed. 37.25 ) specifies the eight qualities of a dūta viz. he must not be stiff-necked, nor timid, nor dilatory, he must be kind and amiable, not liable to be won over by others, free from diseases, endowed with a fine mode of speech. 169 Śānti 85.28 refers to seven qualities. Vide Ayodhyā 100.35, Manu VII. 63–64, Matsyapurāṇa 215. 12-13 for the qualities of a dūta. The dūta should speak only what he has been ordered (by his king) to speak, otherwise he would be liable to be killed (Udyogaparva 72.7, cr, ed. 70,7). Sānti 85. 26-27 say that the person of the data is sacred. Kautilya devotes one chapter (I. 16 ) to the treatment of the subject of data. He states that the data is to be sent by the king after the line of

History of Dharmaśāstra 

(Vol. 

policy has been settled at a council of ministers to the king who is to be attacked (vide Kām. XII. 1 also). A dūta is of three kinds : (1) nisrstārtha 1 (one to whom is entrusted full discretion as to what is to be said ) is one who is possessed of the qualifications required in a minister (amatya), such as Krona from the Pandavas or the ambassadors in modern times; (2) parimitārtha ( entrusted with a definite mission, an envoy ) who possesses the same qualifications as the first less by one quarter ; (3) $ūsanahara (a mere carrier of royal writings or missives ) who possesses only half the qualifications of the first. The Mit. on Yāj. I. 328 lucidly explains the three varieties. Kaut. dilates at great length on the qualifications of the data, what he has to note while in the enemy country, how he is to behave ( such as avoiding women and wine ), how he is to gather information through spies ; but all this has to be passed over for want of space. Vide Kām. XII. 2-24 for the same. Kām. (XII. 22-23 ) briefly sets out the following duties of the duta; determining those who are inimical to the king to whom he is sent, winning over to his side the friends and relatives of the enemy king, finding out the ( number and equipment of) forts, the economic resources and military strength of the enemy king, collection of news as to what the enemy intends to do, bringing over to his side the officers in charge of the districts of enemy country, collecting knowledge about the places of the enemy where battles can be waged by his king or whence he can pass away swiftly. Manu VII. 65 says that it is the data who brings about alliance or war. Kaut, says that when the ruler to whom the dūta is accredited becomes displeased at the message he brings, the dūta should reply 170 . All kings, you and others,' speak through their dūta. Therefore dūtas have to deliver the message entrusted to them even if weapons are raised ( to threaten them ); even the lowest caste dūtas (cāndālas) are not to be killed, what need be said about a dūta who is a

brāhmapa? This ( that I utter ) is the message of another. It is my duty to say it'. The Rāmāyaṇa ( V. 52. 14-15) says that good men do not allow the killing of a dūta, but certain modes of dealing with him ( viz. lashing him, shaving his head) are allowed in certain cases. 

A dūta is to be distinguished from a cura or cūra ( spy ), as done by Kaut., Kam, XII. 32, Yāj. I. 328. Kām. XII. 32 says that a duta is an open ( prakūśa ) spy, while a caru is a spy who works in secret. In modern times also 'an ambassador is often nothing more than an honourable spy acting under the protect ion of the law of nations' (Encyclopædia Britannica on * espionage'). Kaut, devotes four chapters to spies (I. 11-14) and Kān. (XII. 25-49 ) also deals at great length with them. The Sukranstisāra (1. 334-336 ) states that the king should learn every day at night from his secret spies the intentions and actions of his subjects and officers, and the opinions of ministers, enemies, soldiers, the members of the assembly, relations and the women in the harem. The cart must, according to Kām. XII. 25, possess ability to infer the inner thoughts of men), must have a good memory, must be soft in speech, have quick gait, be capable of enduring privations and heavy labour, swift in action, ready-witted. Kaut. (I. 11 ) says !? that spies are those who work in the guise of a kāpxıtiku ( a bold pupil capable of know ing the minds of others ), ulāstluita (a sham ascetic, who has fallen from the real duties of asceticism and is endowed with intelligence and pure character), yrhaputika (a householder who is a cultivator that has not the means to maintain himself, has intelligence and is of pure character ), a wridehaka ( a trader who cannot maintain himself by trade and is possessed of intel ligence and pure character), a lūpnisu (a spy practising auste rities, who has either shaved his head or has matted hair and is desirous to maintain himself ), a class-mate or colleague (sattrin), a desperate character (tikṣna), a poisoner and a female mendicant. The first five of these are called by Kautilya five sarnsthās (groups

(Vol. 

or institutions ), which should be honoured by the king with awards of money and marks of respect and through which the king is to test the purity of the character of his servants. Kautilya says that the spy called udāsthita should carry on agriculture, cattle-rearing and trade on land set apart for the purpose, should be supplied with plenty of gold and disciples and should afford to all (sham ) ascetics food, clothing and lodg ing, direct them to detect particular crimes and report. The spy called tāpasa was to stay near the capital, to have many pupils, to pretend to eat once in a month or two only a handful of vegetables or grass and eat secretly his favourite dishes. His disciples were to proclaim that he possessed supernatural powers, he should pretend to make predictions about gain or fires or fear from robbers after ascertaining from his pupils by nods and signs such events. In I 12 Kaut. deals with wandering spies ( called sancaru ) viz. sattrins (who are orphans that are to be maintained by the State and that are taught palmistry, sorcery, tricks of legerdemain &c.), tikṣna (desperadoes who, regardless of their lives, may fight elephants for money), rasada ( who have no affection even for their relatives, are indolent and cruel), bhikṣuki or parivrājikā (a poor brāhmaṇa widow, clever and desirous to earn her livelihood, honoured in the king's harem and visiting the families of mahāmātras or high ministers). These are to spy on the 18 tirthas (mentioned on p. 112 above ) in public. For spying on their private character persons pretending to be hump-backed, dwarfs, kirātas (pigmies), the deaf and dumb, idiots, the blind, and others that are actors, dancers, singers and the like and women are to be employed. This information is to be tested by the persons belonging to the five sarnsthās ( mentioned above on p. 129 ), but these are to act without their being known by the wandering spies and vice versa. Then further testing by other spies follows. When the information received from these three sources tallies then it will be held reliable; if the information frequently disagrees, the spies should be secretly punished or discharged. A similar rule about sending several spies on the same mission without their knowing each other is laid down by Viṣnudharmot tara II. 24. 66-67. Kaut, in I. 13 deals with espionage on subjects in general (i. e. those in the capital and other parts of the country ). Spies are to pretend to take sides, some praising the king as possessed of all good qualities, others qualifying that praise. They were also to report the rumours spreading among the people, to report whether there was discontent and the king was to honour those who were reported to be contented and to

bring round the discontented by conciliation, gifts, sowing dissensions among them or by punishing them. In. I 14 Kautilya deals with the employment of spies for taking advantage of parties in a foreign State i. e. groups of persons angry with the foreign king or afraid of him or of persons who are ambitious or proud, who are to be won over by appropriate words and stimuli. It will be seen how there was a network of spies of all kinds, so much so that Kām. XII. 28 declares that spies are the king's eyes ( caracakṣur mahipatiḥ). The Viṣnudharmottara II. 24.63 says the same ('rājānas-cāracakṣuṣaḥ ') and also Udyoga 34. 34. cāraih paśyanti rājānaḥ'. In IV. 4-6 Kautilya dilates 178 upon the employment by the samāhart; ( Collector) of a host of spies for suppressing those who are thorns (or disturbers of peace), these being employed for detecting judges ( dharmastha ) and superintendents of various departments that take bribes, counterfeiters of coins, adulterers, thieves and robbers and other criminals. Kautilya relies in extreme cases on spies even in the decision of judicial matters. He says (III. 1 last verse ) 'when owing to the depositions of witnesses the plaintiff's case and the defendant's case are both destroyed, when the cause of either of the parties is found through the spies to be false, then the decree shall be passed against that party'. 178 In Dronaparva 75.4 it is said that Krspa had his spies in the army of Duryodhana and vice versa (74.1). Sānti 69.8–12 and 140.39-42 mention the places where spies are to be set!? up and emphasizes that they should not know each ether. One need not feel surprised at the machinery of espion age that Kautilya. so elaborately describes. All governments in modern times employ spies, informers and secret agents to keep themselves informed of the activities, views and resources of their opponents. We know also how the Indian Police, in order to catch offenders against the Prevention of Gambling Act or other similar Acts, employ agents with marked coins or notes and draw in their net unsuspecting people.

The word 'rastra' occurs even in the Rgveda (IV. 42.1, 'mania dvitā rāstram kṣatriyasya”)-‘mine is the kingdom on both sides (or in both spheres)' says king Trasadasyu. In Rg. VII. 34,11 Varuna is praised as the Lord of rāṣtras ( rājā rāṣtrāṇām &c.). In Rg. VII. 84.2 and X. 109. 3 the word rāstra occurs. In a very famous benedictory 175 passage of the Tai. S. VII. 5. 18. 10 = Vāj. S. 22.22 ) one of the blessings invoked is 'may the king in this kingdom become brave, a skilled archer, and a great warrior', Vide Tai, Br. III. 8. 13 for explanation of the Tai, S. passage. In the Atharvaveda XII. 1. 8 and 10 the earth is called mother and invoked to impart to the rāṣtra strength and brilliance (or energy ). Kām. VI. 3 says 175 that since all the elements of the State spring from the territory of the State, the king should raise up his territory with all his efforts. The Agnipurāṇa 239, 2 holds that rāṣtra is the most important of all elements of the State. Manu VII. 69 prescribes that a king should make his home in a country that is not water-logged (i. e. is dry and not moist ), 176 is rich in crops, inhabited mostly by Aryas (or well-conducted people), not disturbed ( by epidemics &c.), that is charming (owing to trees, flowers and fruits ), the chiefs in which have submitted to him and in which livelihood can be had easily. Yāj. I. 321 and Visnudharmasūtra III. 4-5 are to the same .effect. Kām. (IV. 50-56 ) remarks the territory of

the king depends for its prosperity on the qualities of the soil, the prosperity of the territory tends to the prosperity of the king; therefore a king should choose for the sake of his prosperity land possessing good qualities. That land is prefer red for the sake of prosperity that is endowed with various crops and minerals, is full of merchandise, mines and various substances, that is favourable to cattle-rearing, that abounds in water, is inhabited by well-conducted people, is charming, has forests and elephants, has facilities of water and road transport and does not depend upon rain-water only.' 177 Land that is full of gravel and stones, full of forests always infested with thieves, that is waterless, full of thorny bushes and snakes is not fit for choosing as a rūśtra. A country is to be preferred that yields livelihood easily, is possessed of the qualities of good land (cited above), is full of water, that has hills in it, that consists mostly of sūdras, artisans and merchants, the husbandmen in which undertake great projects, that is loyal (to the king ) and averse to the king's enemy, that can put up with troubles and taxes, that is large in extent, full of people from various countries, that follows the right path, that possesses plenty of cattle and wealth, the principal men in which are not foolish nor vicious. These requirements show that the country must be prosperous, well-stocked with the necessaries of life and well suited to defence. There is also some difference of opinion among the smrti writers about the composition of the population, Manu VII. 69 requires that the kingdom should consist mostly of aryas (āryaprāya), while Viṣnu Dh. S. III. 5 holds that a country should be peopled mostly by vaiśyas and sūdras. In another place ( VIII. 22) Manu says that that country in which sūdras abound, which is full of atheists and void of dvijas is overwhelmed by disease and famine and perishes. Similar provisions are found in the Matsyapurana 217. 1-5, Viṣnudharmottara II. 26. 1-5, Mānasol lasa (II. 3. verses 151-153), Nitivākyāmsta (Janapadasamud deśa p. 191 which defines rāṣtra, viṣaya, deśa, janapada &c.). The Matsyapurāna 217. 5 and Viṣnudharmottara II. 26.5, (pvainvidhain ynthālābham rajā viṣny amāriset) point out that

overy rāṣtra cannot be expected to possess all the qualities mentioned by them and that the king must do the best with such qualities as his country possesses. Kautilya II. 1 advises 178 the king to found a district of villages either on old sites or on new ones by inducing people from other countries to immigrate or by causing thickly populated parts of his own country to send its overflowing population and to see that each village consists of not less than one hundred families nor more than five hundred, is peopled mostly by śūdra cultivators, has an extent of one krosa or two and is capable of offering help to its neighbours. 

According to Paurānic geography there are seven dvipas, viz. Jambu, Plakṣa, Sālmala, Kuśa, Krauñca, Saka and Puskara (Visnupurāna II. 1. 11 ff) and each dvīpa is divided into varsas. Jambudvipa has 9 Varṣas of which Bharatavarṣa is the first (Visnupurāna II. 2. 12 ff). The Mahabharata speaks of 13 dvipas (Ādi. 75. 19, Vanaparva 3. 52 and 134. 20 ) and 18 dvipas also (Drona 70.15). For Bharatavarṣa vide H. Dh. vol. II. pp. 17-18. Manu II. 20 looks upon the holy land of Kurukṣetra, of the Matsyas, Pancalas and Sūrasenas as 'the chosen country' the learned brāhmaṇas in which were to be the leaders and guides of the whole world in appropriate thoughts and actions. The Viṣṇu ( II. 3.2), Brāhma, Mārkandeya 55. 21-22 and other purāṇas proudly assert that Bharatavarga is the land of action (karmabhumi). This is patriotismı of a sort but not of the kind we see in western countries. Bharatavarṣa itself has comprised numerous countries from the most ancient times. The names of countries and the tribes or people inhabiting them were the same (vide Pāṇini IV. 1. 168, 

178. भूतपूर्वमभूतपूर्व वा जनपद परदेशापवाहनेन स्वदेशाभियन्दव ममेन वा मि शयेत् । शुवकर्षकमायं कुलशतावरं पञ्चशतकुलपरं माम क्रोशद्धिकोसीमाममन्योन्यारक्षं 

Thanh Bugil II. 1. This passage clearly shows that Kauṭilya at least employed the word janapada in the sense of a territory to be colonized and as one which was either included within the kingdom or not so included. Dr. Pran Nath's interpretation of janapada that it was only a part of the kingdom' (p. 47, Study in the economic condition of ancient India') cannot be accepted in view of the express words wagening. The usage of classical writers and the Purāṇas shows that janapada means simply country' and Amara gives it as a synonym of ast and fūr and Mirat explains that 

are is called it. The Kāvyamimāmsā on which Dr. Pran Nath relies for the number of countries employs the word janapada for the names of the countries in the four quarters of India ( not for parts of any kingdom).

Turvaśas, Druhyus, Anus and Pūrus (Rg. 1. 108, 8, VIII. 10.5 &c.) and the countries of Cedi (VIII. 5. 39), Kikata ( III. 53, 4), Rjika ( VIII. 7. 29), Rusama ( V. 30.12 ), Vetasu (X. 49, 4). In the Atharvaveda V, 22 several peoples or countries are mention ed of which Bahlikas (in vv 5 and 9), Mūjayat (vv 5 and 8), Gandhāri, Anga, Magadha ( in v. 14) deserve notice. The Ait. Br. (38. 3) divides India into five divisions in the east, south, west and north ( the Uttara Kurus and Uttara Madras ) and in the centre (Kuru-Pancāla and Vasa-Uśinara ). India was divided into two parts, Dakṣiṇāpatba (from the Narmadā southwards ) and Uttarāpatha at least some centuries before Christ, since the Hāthigumphā Ins. (E. I. vol. 20 at p. 79 ) mentions a great many kings of Uttarāpatha and the Maha bhāsya refers to lakes in Dakṣiṇāpatha." In the Brāhmaṇas frequent mention is made of the Kuru-Pañcālas (Tai, Br. 1.8. 4), Uttarakuru, Uttara-madra, Kuru-Pañcālas, Vaśa-Usinaras (in Ait. Br. 38.3), Kuru-Pancālas, Anga-Magadhas, Kāśi-Kośalas, Sālva-Matsyas, Vaśa-Uśinaras in Gopatha II. 10(ed. by Gastra ). The Gandhāras occur in Chandogya Up. (VI. 14. 1), Videha in Bṛ. Up. III. 1. 1, Madras in Bp.Up. III. 3.1. In the Maha bhārata there are long lists of countries in various connections, which are more than 200 (e. g. Sabhā 4. 21-32, 20. 26-30, Sabhā 25 ff, Sabhā 52. 13-19,53. 5-9, Virāta 1. 12-13, Bhiṣma. 9. 39-69, 50.47-53, Droṇa 11.15-18, 70.11-13, Aśvamedhika 73-78, 83.10 ff.) The Baudhāyana-gļhyaśeṣasūtra 1. 17 prescribes a mandala for the worship of the Sun and names nine countries in the eight directions and in the centre as representatives. The Purānas also contain long lists of countries e. g. Matsya 114, 34-56, Mārkandeya 57.32-67 and chap. 58, Brāhma 17.10-15 and 25.25-39. The same country sometimes has two names (e. g. Vidarbha and Krathakaiśika denote the same country in Raghuvamsa VIL 1 and 32). “Buddhist India'(by Rhys Davids p. 23) mentions the sixteen peoples (or countries), lists of which occur in the Anguttaranjkāya I. p. 213, IV. p. 252 and in the Dighanikāya

Varaha mihira's Bṭhatsaṁhitā, Baudhāyana-gphyasesasūtra 1. 17, Kāmagūtra V.6. 33-41, Bārhaspatya Arthasāstra (II. 83-117), the Kāvyamimāṁsā of Rajasekhara (17th chapter) name numerous countries. This last divides India into five regions and gives the names of about 70 countries in the four directions but none from Central India. The Bhāvaprakāśana (pp. 309-310) gives a list of 64 countries and states that Dakṣiṇāpatha (Deccan) is a fourth of Bharatavarṣa and that in the Tretā and Dvāpara ages people afraid of being overwhelmed by ice came down to the south, 1784 56 countries are named in some Tantra works (vide 'Indian Culture' vol. VIII. p. 33). In the lexicon called Vaijayanti of Yadavaprakāśa (11th century A.D.) edited by Dr. G. Oppert, over a hundred countries and capitals of some of the countries are named (in the Bhūmikānda and chapter on deśa thereof). 

To constitute a rāstra a territory of some size and a large population are required. There can hardly be a rāstra of a few villages or a few hundred inhabitants. The boundaries of the numerous countries mentioned in the works cited above must have been fluid and must have changed from country to 

country owing to conquests. 

In ancient India the modern sentiment of nationalism had hardly taken root. Writers speak of rājya ( State ) and of rāstra ( territory ) as an element of rājya. They had no sense of 'nationality nor did they seriously work for national unity. The modern idea of a nation is more a question of feeling and senti inent than of objective fact. The State has been at all times a great co-ordinating agency, but as its boundaries were extremely variable in ancient India, the modern sentiment of nationality, of 'my country, right or wrong' hardly ever arose in India (except perhaps for over a century in Maharastra in the 17th and 18th centuries and among the Sikhs). In the whole of Hindu India, there was no doubt a certain unity of religion, philosophy, literary forms and conventions of arts and forms of worship, and in reverence for holy places, but this did not make for a deep seated and effective sentiment of nationhood or national unity.

Sentiment of nationality 

137 

Most of the ancient sūtrakāras and smftis try to lay down the limits of the holy land of Aryāvarta and differentiate it from the lands of mlecchas. Vide H. of Dh. vol. II. pp. 11-18. The Viṣnu (II. 3. 1-2), Mārkandeya (55. 21) and other purāṇas wax eloquent over the inportance of Bharatavarga and describe it as the land of action for those who want to secure heaven or final release or as the land where alone sin and religious merit were to be found ( karmabhūmir-iyam svargan-apavargam ca gacchatām or tat-karma bhūmir-nūnyatra samprūptih punyapāpayoh in Mārk.). Manu (II. 20) manifests great pride in and love for the holy countries of Brahmāvarta, Kuruksetra, Matsya, Pañcāla and Sūrasena by glorifying the brāhmanas of these countries as those from whom all men on this broad earth should learn the actions and usages appropriate to them'. Vas. I. 10 also says the same. Saṅkha Likhita (q. by Visvarūpa on Yāj. I. 2) hold that the country of Āryāvarta is endowed with high qualities, is ancient and holy (desa Aryo guravān ...... sinātanah punyah). As however the smptis were composed at different times, embodied the usages of different provinces in India and as they provided for the observances of all those who followed the Veda, they do not generally lay emphasis on localities but rather on what they thought was common to all Aryas in India (yat tu samūnam tad vakṣyūnah, as Āśv. gṛ, says). There was no doubt a great emotional regard for Bharatavarṣa or Aryavarta as a unity for many centuries among all writers from a religious point of view, though not from a political standpoint. Therefore one element of modern nationhood viz. being under the same government was wanting. But it must be noted that from very ancient times there was always the aspiration among great kings and the people to bring the whole of Bharatavarga "under one umbrella". Even in the West the sentiment of nationality practically arose after the partition of Poland, and as a conse quence of the French Revolution and of the Industrial revolution, which led manufacturing countries to search for markets and to exploit backward and less developed peoples. Vide Laski's 'Grammar, of Politics' chap. VI. Modern nationalism un doubtedly leads to great self-sacrifice and produces certain virtues of high value in the individuals that are fired by that sentiment. But the ideals of the modern nation States are not high, particularly in their treatment of other peoples and in their attitude towards less favoured States. The one aim of the leading politicians of modern nation States and most of the inhabitants of these States seems to be to raise the standard of

(Vol. 

living of their citizens to a high level and to maintain it at that level even by exploiting and robbing weaker races and lands. This is not the place to discuss these matters further. Whatever the value of nationalism to the individuals fired by it may be, from the point of the welfare of the whole of mankind, modern nation States do not deserve to survive, unless the so called progressive nation States are prepared to give up their racial pride, their spirit of grabbing and exploitation and to extend a brotherly hand to all struggling States to improve themselves in their own way and attain to higher standards of living without let or hindrance. It cannot be gainsaid that for several centuries in the past and also at the present moment all modern nation States have two moralities, one for their own nation and the other for their dealings with foreign States and races. 

Some remarks must now be made about provincial and local administration. Each kingdom comprised deśas (countries) and subdivisions of deśas. The governor of a rāstra was called rāṣtrapati or rāṣtriya. Vide p. 117 above about Puṣyagupta hav ing been the rāṣtriya of Surāṣtra (Kathiawad) under Candragupta Maurya and Sānti 85. 12 (which describes what the rāṣtriya is to do ). 

According to the Amarakośa the words desa, rāstra, visaya and janapada are synonyms. Epigraphic usage is not uniform about the dimensions of these. Sometimes visaya appears to be a sub-division of deśa (vide the words “rāstrapati-viṣayapati grāmakūta' in I. A, vol. VIII. at p. 20 in the grant of Cālukya Tribhuvanamalla in sake 999 and I. A, vol. XII pp. 247, 251 in the grant of Rāṣtrakūta Govinda in sāke 855). But in the Hirahada galli plates (E. I. vol. I. p. 5) 'viṣaya' occurs first and then 'rāṣtra'; so it appears that there' visaya' is deemed to be larger than rāstra. According to the Sahyadrikhanda ( uttarārdha, chap. 4) deśa is made up of 100 villages, mandala is made up of 4 deśas, a khanda of 100 mandalas and the earth has nine khandas. 180 From the Cambay plate of sake 852 (930 A. D.), we see that mandala was a sub-division of deśa (E. I. vol. 7 p. 26, at p. 40). From

the Bangarh grant of Mahipāla I (E. I. vol. 14 p. 324) and the Amgachhi plate of Vigrahapālā II we see that mandala was smaller than viṣaya which again was a subdivision of 'bhukti'. The word' bhoga' (which is similar in origin to 'bhukti') appears to be applied to a sub-division of visaya (which in its turn is a sub-division of rāstra ) in the Bhamdak 181 plate of Krsnarāja I dated sake 694 (E. I. 14 p. 121, 126 ) and also in the Jejuri plates of Vinayāditya in 609 sake ( E. I. vol. 19 p. 62 at p. 64 where the word 'rastrapati' does not occur). The Mitākṣarā on Yāj. I. 319 explains that only a king (mahipati ) can make a grant of land and not a bhogapati (i. e. the officer over a bhoga). Another ancient word for a division of a country is āhārı which occurs in the Rupnath Rock inscription and Sarnath pillar Edict of Asoka (Corpus I. I. vol. I pp. 162 and 166 ), in the Nasik Inscriptions No. 3 and 12 (Govardhanāhāra and Kāpurāhāra, E. I. vol. VIII pp. 65 and 82 ) and in the Karle 

Ins. No. 19 (E. I. VII. p. 64 ) where we have Mamalāhāra, modern Māval ( in Poona District ). For want of space it is not possible to pursue this subject here. For further information vide Dr. Fleet in J. R. A. S. for 1912 p. 707 and my paper on * the Ancient Geography of Mahārāstra' (JBBRAS. vol. XXIV for 1914-1917 pp. 648-653 ). In the epigraphic records particularly of the Deccan and South India we come across names of territorial divisions to which small as well as very large figures (indicat ing the number of villages they comprised) are affixed: e. g. a group of twelve villages in Aparānta on the sea near Kalvivana (modern Kelvem) is mentioned in the Sanjan plates of Bud dhavarasa ( E. I. 14 p. 144 at p. 150 ), Nyayapadra saptadaśa in Bhoja's grant in sarnvat 1076 (E. I. 18 at p. 322), Kisukād 70 (E. I. 15 p. 73), Beļvola 300 ( in E.

Kautilya II. 1 says that in the kingdom groups of villages should be set up with a chief town or fort in each, a group of ten villages being called Sangrahaṇa, of two hundred villages being called Khāryaṭika, of 400 villages being called Drona mukha, and in the midst of 800 villages 188 there is the Sthaniya.

Furafit has a similarity in sound and meaning to modern thānā, Dr. Pran Nath (in Study of the economic condition of Ancient India' p. 26 ) priocipally relying on a commentator of the Jain works called Prajñāpaoopānga ( which he misunderstands:) holds that grāma' does not mean 'a village', but 'an estate or survey village which can pay 18 kinds of Government taxes'. The learned Doctor says that he consulted many Sanskrit lexicons, but did not find this interpretation in any one of them. That should bave induced him to be cautious. But he makes the bold and facile assumption that lexicons were compiled from a literary view.point and are not of much assistance as far as the technical meanings of words are concerned'. His great authority, the Jaio commentator, says ' 

T H E Nunta Tala witryon na MTA: of 10: TEHETSARTE 

TOMTAR IA:'. Dr. Pran Nath's Jain authority is no better than texicographers and their commentators. Turit on Amara derives grāma as a HITHTA:' i. e, the word yra is derived from the root ra. The Jain commentator first derives the word of\# from 7 and then from 7. Dr. Pran Nath forgets that a fanciful or scholastic derivation is not a definition. The rest of the reasoning on the new meaning of grāma is on a par with this and cannot be examined in detail. A commentator expressly states (ibid p. 27) that he gives only the vyutpatti (etymology) of grāma, but Dr. Prān Nāth pays no heed to this. He has not correctly grasped the scholastic discussion in the commentary quoted on p. 27. He misunder stands the word 'samagrāwāh'in Yaj. II. 152. The Amarakośa expressly says that sama' and 'samāna ' are synonyms. He is often very dogmatic without looking into all ancient and medieval authorities e. g. on p. 51 he charges Dr. Fleet with misinterpretation of a jātaka text (addha-tiyani satani) which Dr. Fleet translated as 250, while Dr. Prān Nāth is sure that the meaning is · 150'. He probably never noticed that so far back as the 2nd century B. C. the Mahābhāsya had explained the word 'ardhatrtiya' as Dr. Fleet does ( Brill arqagt or pu fa71:, vide Kielhorn, vol I. p. 426 on vārtika 22 on Pān. II. 2. 24). There is hardly any warrent for Dr. Prān Nātb's assertion that each grāma (as interpreted by him) contained only about five families and had only about 15 or 20 acres of cropped area (pp. 39-40). Kauṭ. (note 178 ) states that a grāma contains from 100 

PPM to ono inteles car to 500 families. If the inscriptions so far 

which 

come 

published are carefully searched it will be found that grāma ordinarily meant a village in the modern sense and included several hundred acres of land. For example, in a grant of Pallava Yuvamabārāja Viṣnugopavarman (1, A, vol. V p. 50)

Manu VII. 114 similarly observes that in the midst of two, three or five villages the king should place a central post of guards called 'gulma' and another called 'sangraha' in the midst of a hundred villages. Manu VII. 115-117, Viṣṇudharma sūtra III. 7-14, Santi 87.3ff, Agnipurāṇa 223. 1-4, Visnudharmot tara II. 61. 1-6, Mānasollāsa II. %. 159-162 (p. 43) require the king to appoint a hierarchy of officers for one village, for groups of ten, twenty, hundred and thousand villages, who are to report what is wrong within their jurisdictions that they cannot themselves remedy to the officer next in grade above themselves and Manu VII. 120 prescribes that a minister of the king should supervise the doings and conflicts of all these officers. The Edicts of Asoka show that he had to employ a hierarchy of officers such as the mahāmātras, the yuktas and rājukas for the administration of his vast empire. A similar administrative system seems to have been continued under the Gupta Emperors. From the Damodarpur, Baigram and other plates (E. I. XV. p. 113, E. I. XVII. pp. 345ff, E. I. XXI. p. 78 ) it appears that the Provincial Governors were appointed by the Gupta Emperor himself and were called uparika mahārāja, that either the Governors or Emperors appointed District officers (visayapati) who were often called Kumārāmātya, that the District officers were aided in their administrative work by a board of four advisers called nagara-śreṣthin (banker), sārthavāha (chief merchant), prathamakulika (chief of craft guilds) and prathama kāyastha (chief secretary), that the District officer had his 

(Continued from last page) very detailed and accurate boundaries of a village of 200 nivartanas are given. A nivartana was equal to a square of twenty vanisas on each side, each vamsa being equal to ten cubits; so that a nivartana covered an area of 40000 cubits (200 x 200) i, e, about 90000 square feet, while an acre is equal to 43560 square feet. Therefore the village referred to in the above grant was over 400 acres in extent. The Mahābhāṣya (on vārtika 8 on Pan. I. 1. 7) has an interesting discussion on the several meanings of the word grāma in popular language viz. a number of houses (as in the grāma was burnt), the village wall or ditch (as in 'he entered the grāma'), 'men' (as in the grāma had gone'), & village with its forests and bushes, with its boundaries (such as rivers and hills) and with embaoked fields (as in 'a grāma was acquired').

headquarters in a place called adhiṣthāna and had his several offices or courts (adhikaranas), and that in sales of lands revenue officers called pustapūlas (keepers of records of rights ) were consulted and had to report. In E. I. vol. XVII. pp. 345, 348 a copperplate of Kumāragupta I has 

grāmāsta-kulādhikaraṇam' which means an office having jurisdiction over 8 villages. Manu VII. 119 says that the officer over 10 villages was to have as his salary a kula of land and kula is here said to mean (by Kullūka) as much land as is ploughed by two ploughs having six oxen yoked to each. The Vaijayanti on Viṣnu Dh. S. III. 15 says “kulam haladvaya karsaniyā bhūh! Sukra (I. 191-192) states that the lord of one hundred grāmas is called sāmanta, an officer appointed by a king over one hundred villages is called anusāmanta, one over ten villages is called nāyaka ( compare modern' naik'). Manu VII. 61 and 81, Yāj. I. 322, Kām. V. 75, Viṣnudharmasūtra III. 16-21, Visṇudharmottara II. 24. 48-49 say that the king should appoint as many adhyakṣas ( superintendents) as are required for the several departments of the state, who are clever, honest and of good family. Kautilya 188 IL-9 prescribes ' those who are possessed of the qualifications for amātyas (cited on p. 107 above) should be appointed, according to their abilities, as superinten dents of the various departments and the king should constantly examine their work, since men are naturally fickle-minded and when appointed to do work exhibit like horses change of temper'. It is pointed out in works like the Visṇudharmasūtra III. 16-21 and the Viṣnudharmottara II. 24. 48–49, Sānti 69, 29, that those who are highly devoted to dharma should be appointed to the ecclesiastical or judicial department, the brave ones to military work, those who are skilled to revenue work and those who are very trustworthy should be placed in charge of mines, salts, toll-gates, ferries, elephant forests. 

Kautilya in his 2nd adhikarana exhaustively deals with the work done in 28 departments and the duties of their superin tendents. He enters into very minute details about each and his work is encyclopaedic in character on this subject.

Kautilya's work became the authority on Government and several inscriptions mention officers appointed according to the section on 'adhyakṣapracāra', which is undoubtedly a reference to Kautilya's 2nd adhikarana. For example, in the Belava plate of Bhojavarmadeva (E. I vol. XII. at p. 40) and in the Barrackpur grant of Vijayasena (E. I. vol. XV. p. 283 ) we have the words 'angāmsca sakala rājapādopajivinodhyakṣapracāroktın ihākirtitān cattabhata jātiyān janapadan kṣetrakarāṁsca'. It is not possible to do anything more than indicate very briefly the sphere of each adhyakṣa. The duty of the sannidhātr (1). 5) is to look after the construc tion of the treasury house, the store-houses for merchandise, for grain, for forest produce, for arms and of the jail. The samāhartr (the Collector-General) is to exercise superintendence over the collection of revenue from forts, the rural parts, mines, embank ments, forests, herds of cattle and roads for traffic ( II. 6). The samāhartr 184 has to divide (II. 35) the kingdom into four districts and to arrange the villages into three grades, viz. those that are exempted from taxes, those that supply soldiers and those that pay taxes in the form of grain, cattle, money, forest produce, free labour and other equivalents for taxes. It is the duty of the gopa to look after a group of five or ten villages under the orders of the samāharts. The gopa has not only to register the total number of the inhabitants of all varpas in the houses that pay taxes and that are exempt in the villages, but also to keep a register of the number of cultivators, cowherds, merchants, artisans, labourers, slaves, biped and quadruped animals, of the amount of monoy, free labour, tolls and fines that are recovered, and the number of women, men, young and old persons, and the extent of their actions, occupations, usages, expenditures. The sthānika (in charge of each of the four districts) should look after his charge in the same way. The superintendent of records and accounts (aksapatalādhyaksa ) should have the account office constructed with its door facing the north or the east, with rooms 

184, Both the samāharts and the sannidhāts are mentioned as officers in the copperplate of Mahābhavagupta of Trikalinga (E. I. vol. VIII. p. 138 at p. 141 and E. I, vol. XI at p. 94). Sabara in his bhāsya on Jaimini XII. 1. 28 refers to the samāharts coming with his own phalanx of subordinates 'यथा सेनापतिर्भस्यबलेन सहागतः समाइर्मा निजेन बलेन राजा त सबलस्तैश्चान्यैश्च। From Hiquen Thsang's account of his travels (Beal's · Buddhist Records' vol. I. p. 78 ) we learn that each province kept a record of good and bad events.

(for the clerks) set apart and with shelves of account books well arranged (II. 7). This officer had to enter numerous matters in the accounts, recover the king's dues from the sureties of servants, to check onbezzlement and to recover fines for loss due to neglect or fraud. The account year ended with the full moon of Aṣadha, the year being of 354 days and the salary for an intercalary month being separately paid. Among the duties of the Superintendent of records and accounts was the important one of noting in his register the dharma, method of judicial procedure and the usages of countries, villages, castes, families and corporations ( desagrāmajāti-kulasanghātānām dharma. vyavahāra-caritra-samsthānam ............ nibandha-pustakastham kārayet). In II. 8 Kautilya specifies forty modes of embezzle ment by Government servants ( to which a reference is made in the Dasakumāracarita VIII ). In II. 9 he employs the picturesque figure that it is not possible to know exactly how officers appointed to the several businesses of the State extract wealth, just as fish always dwelling in water cannot be observed when they drink water. The superintendent of treasury (II. 11) shall in the presence of qualified persons receives into the treasury gems, pearls, articles of great or small value and forest produce (like sandal wood, (ugaru etc.). The superintendent of minos and of government manufactories (II. 12 ) must be proficient in the science of metals, mercury, liquids that ooze from the holes, caves and sides of mountains and hills. Under him are officers called lohādhyaksa ( who carries on the manu facture of vessels of copper and other metals ), a lakṣanādhyaksa ( a superintendent of mint, who manufactures silver and copper coins for the State ), a rūpadurśaka 1844 ( examiner of coins, who regulates the dealings with paṇas as a medium of exchange among the people and for stocking in the treasury), khanyadhyakṣa ( who attends to conches, diamonds, pearls, coral and trade in them), a lavaṇādhyakṣa ( superintendent of salt). The suvarṇā dhyaksa (the superintendent of gold) has to construct a goldsmith's office for the manufacture of gold and silver articles with a single door and four halls, to appoint a skilful and trustworthy goldsmith to have a shop in the centre of the road (II. 13 ) and not to allow any one who is not an employee to

enter the goldsmith's shop. If any one so entered he was to be beheaded. The State goldsmith (II. 14) has to manufacture gold and silver coins for the citizens and rural inhabitants through artisans employed by him. The superintendent of the storehouse (II. 15 ) has to keep together the produce of crown lands, taxes from the country districts, accidental revenue, manufacture of rice, oil &c. The superintendent of commerce ( panyādhyakṣa, II. 16 ) should keep himself acquainted with the demand or absence of demand for and the rise and fall in the prices of various kinds of merchandise produced on land or from water and brought by land or water routes. The superintendent of forest produce (kūpyādhyaksa, II. 17 ) was to collect forest produce through guards of forest and Kautilya gives a long list of trees, varieties of bamboos, creepers, fibrous plants and rope making material, drugs and poisons, skins of various animals, that came under this officer's care. The superintendent of armoury (āyudhāgārādhyakṣa, II. 18 ) was to employ experienc ed artisans to manufacture arms, wheels, machines, armour &c. required in battle or for the defence of forts, or for battering the cities of the enemy. The superintendent of weights and measures 185 was to get manufactured weights from half mūṣaka 

185. The weights specified are: 10 seeds of māsa or 5 guñjās=1 suvarna. māsaka, 16 suvarna-masakas =one suvarna or karsa, 4 karsas one pala. 88 white mustard seeds=one rūpyamāsaka, 16 rūpyamāsakas or 20 saibya seeds =one dharana. The Kāsikā on Pān. II, 4.21 furnishes the interesting item of information that weights and measures (probably in vogue in its day) were first introduced by the Nandas (pandopakramāṇi mānāni). The chief measures of distance given in II. 20 are: 8 atoms=one particle of dust thrown up by a chariot wheel, 8 particles = likṣā, 8 liks as a medium-sized yūkā (louse), 8 yūkās =yava (barley corn) of medium size, 8 yavas - one angula, 12 angulas - vitasti, 2 vitastis = aratai or one prājāpatya hand, 2 vitastis plus 4 angulas (called dhanurgraha)=one hasta used in measuring pastures and cubic measures, 4 aratnis danda or dhanus or nālikā-paurusa, 10 dandas -rajju, 3 rajjus = nivartana, 1000 dbanus (or 2000 acc. to another reading) =goruta, 4 gorutas= one yojana. A nivartana was probably so called because it represented a day's ploughing by a team of eight or six oxen (from the root vrt with ni), meaning the area from which they stopped after a day's work. Vide H. of Dh. vol. II. p. 859 note 2021 for nivartana and gocarma. The extent of the nivartana differed acc. to different authorities. The Matsya said it was 30 dandas square, each danda being of the length of seveo hastas, while Sātātapa held the danda to be of 10 bastas, The Lilāvati (1.7 ) held that a pivartana was 20 vamsas square, each vamsa being of 10 hastas. According to the lexicon Vaijayanti, in Kosala the yojana was of four gavyūtis, while

[Vol. 

onwards up to one hundred suvarpas, weights being made of iron or stones found in the Magadha country and the Mekala mountain. The superintendent of tolls (sulkādhyakṣa, II. 21 ) was to erect near the principal gate of the capital a toll-house and its flag and when traders arrived with merchandise make four or five toll-collectors take down their names, whence they came, what merchandise they brought and whether it bore seal mark. In II. 22 Kautilya specifies various rates of tolls for imports and exports. The superintendent of weaving (II. 23) was to employ qualified persons to make threads, coats ( of armour ), cloths and ropes and he was to employ for cutting wool, fibres, cotton, hemp and flax, widows, cripple women, girls, ascetic women paying off fines by doing work, mothers of prostitutes, old women servants of the palace, devadāsis ( temple girls) who have ceased to do temple services. This superintendent was charged with the task of providing work for women who do not leave their homes, the wives of persons who have gone abroad, women who are cripple or unmarried and who have to work for their own maintenance. He was to give to them spinn ing work through the maid-servants in his department. If he stared at their faces when they came to exchange their work for wages or spoke to them on any other matter he was fined in the first amercement. Thus the State helped home or cottage industry. It is to be noted that he had large powers of levying fines and 

(Continued from the last page) in Magadha it was only equal to two gavyūtis (last verse of desądhyāya in bhumikhanda). Kaut. gives hastas of various lengths for various purposes, Compare Mapu VIII. 132-134, Viṣnudharmasūtra IV. 1-7, Yāj. I. 362-363, Nārada parisista 57-60, Brhatsamhitā, 57. 1 ff, Vāyupurāna 101.118 for some of these, which differ in some details from Kautilya's statements. Kaut. (11, 20) states the duration of a nūdikā to be the time required for the passage of one ādhaka of water from a pot through an aperture of the same diameter as a wire of 4 angulas in length and made out of four suvarnamāsakas, 2 nādikās are equal to a muhurta and 15 mubūrtas are equal to a day or a night. In II. 19 he gives measures of corn as follows: 4 kudumbas = prastha, 4 prasthas = adhaka, 4 ādhakas = droña, 16 dronas = kbāri, 20 droṇas -- kumbha. The drona differed for various purposes. Vide above (p. 124 note 165) for a quotation from Mit, on Yaj. III. 274. Hemadri, vratakhanda pp. 51-57, gives quotations from various sources for measures of time, corn &c. These measures were different in different countries and at different times. The Lilāvati (of 12th century A.D.) I. 7 speaks of the khāri in Magadha being equal to 16 dronas. Vide n. 165 above and H. of Db. vol. II. p. 881 2. 2053 and L. D. Barnett's 'Antiquities of India' (pp. 206-210) for tables of weights and measures.

awarding bodily punishments e. g. if a woman refused to work after receiving the wages he could cut off her thumb (? or bind up her thumb with the index finger so as to form a pair of tongs ). The superintendent of agriculture (sitādhyakṣa, 186 II. 24) himself knowing or assisted by those who know the science of agriculture and the Ayurveda ( the ancient lore ) of trees was to collect at the proper times all kinds of corn, flowers, fruits, vegetables, bulbs, hemp and cotton seeds and to employ slaves, labourers and prisoners who worked to pay off fines they could not pay, to sow seeds on crown lands. In this chapter he makes interesting remarks about the extent of rainfall viz. the rainfall in a jāngala country (defined above at p. 132) is 16 droṇas, in anūpu (very moist) countries 24 dronas, 131 dronas in the Aśmaka country (modern Khandesh and part of Berar ), 23 droṇas in the Avanti country (round about modern Ujjain), an immense quantity in the Aparāntas ( west coast of India ) and the Himālayan regions. 

The superintendent of liquor was to carry on the traffic in liquor and ferments in the capital, the other parts of the country and in army camps by employing men familiar with them, he was to impose a fine of 600 paṇas if any one other than the manufacturers, licensed vendors and vendees sold or purchased liquor, he was not to allow liquor-shops to be opened close to each other, he was to see that liquor was sold in small quantities such as or of a kudumba or a half prastha to persons of known character in order that ( lit. for fear) workmen employed should not cause loss through carelessness, that āryas might not violate the rules of good conduct and that desperadoes should not commit indiscreet acts. Sukra was even more strict as regards 

186. Sitā, according to the Amarakośa, means the lines or furrow made by the ploughshare'. Therefore Kautilya appears to employ the word 

• sitā' in the sense of land that has been cultivated'. Prof V. K. Ran. chandra Dikshitar (in 'Hindu Administrative Institutions. p. 369 ) is not right when he explains FIAT MI5Wara: (of Amara) as' methods and means connected with the plough'. Paddhati only means the line or furrow made in the field by the ploughshare. Kșiraswāmi explains as they ar e T. In II. 15 Kautilya himself explains. sitā 'as the collection of grain brought in by the superintendent of agriculture TUTTI: Ffradra: . The sitadhyaksa appears to have been concerned with crown lands, while the share of crops leviable on lands of private ownership was called 'bali'. Both these were the concern of the samāhartṛ as stated in V, 1. ( where rāstra is said to include sitā, bhāga, bali, kara &c.). When in II. 15 sitā and rāspra are separately mentioned that is on the analogy of the maxim of brāhman aśramana or of gobalivarda.

wine, as he did not allow any one to drink wine in the day-time (IV. 4. 43). The superintendent of slaughter houses ( sūnk dhyakṣa, II. 26 ) was entrusted with the power to regulate the killing of animals for meat and was to impose the highest amerce ment on those who trapped or beat or killed deer, cattle, birds or fish which were declared to be under State protection or that dwelt in protected forests. The superintendent of nautch-girls (ganikādhyaksa 187 ) is dealt with in II. 27. The topic of vetyās has already been treated of in H. Dh. vol. II. pp. 637-639. Kaut, says that a gaạika was to be employed for a salary of one thousand panas, whether she was born in a prostitute's family or not and she was to possess beauty, youth and accomplish ments (i. e. the 64 kalās enumerated in Kāmasūtra 1. 3. 16). Kaut, prescribes that, if she left the country or died, her daughter or sister took her place and estate or her mother could substitute some other gaṇikā in her place; when none of these existed the king took her wealth and her son did not inherit her wealth. A gaạikā could purchase her freedom by paying to the king 24000 paṇas as ransom. She was to hold the umbrella, the golden pitcher and the fan for the king when he was seated on the throne or in a chariot or in his palanquin. There were grades among the gapikās as best, middling and inferior and salaries differed by a thousand. The sons of prostitutes were to be the chief actors on the royal stage. It appears from these provisions that the vesyas were more or less slaves. The superintendent of ships (nāvadhyakṣa, II, 28 ) was to look after the passage of ships not only over the seas and at the mouths of rivers, but also over lakes and rivers in the sthāniya ( vide above p. 140 ) and other sub-divisions of the kingdom. Kaut. prescribes that villages on the sea-shore and river banks were to pay a fixed tax, fishermen were to render a sixth part of the haul of fish as fees for fishing licenses and merchants were to pay the customary tolls levied in port towns. This superintendent was to request the ships that touched at a harbour on their voyage to a distant port to pay the toll, he was to destroy pirate vessels bound for the country of an enemy as well as those that violated the usages of the port. The superintendent of cattle ( II. 29) was entrusted with the rearing,

preservation and care of cows, bulls, buffaloes and the dairy produce. The superintendent of horses ( II. 30) was to record the breed, age, colour, marks, groups and places of origin of horses, which were to be classified as those kept in salehouses for sale, those that were recently purchased, those captured in battles, those that were pledged and those temporarily kept in stables &c. Kaut. notes that the breed of horses from Kāmbhoja, Sindhu (modern Sindh), Aratta ( western Punjab ) and Vanāyu (North west of India ) countries are the best of horses, Bāhlika (modern Balkh), Pāpeya, Sauvira (eastern Sindh and western Rajputana) and Taitila breeds are of middle quality and the rest are inferior. The superintendent of elephants ( II. 31 ) had to take steps to guard elephant forests and supervise elephants that were in stables, the catching, training and feeding of them, their accoutrements &c. Kaut. devotes one chapter (II. 32 ) to the training and classification of elephants and medical treatment when they fell ill. The superintendent of chariots and that of infantry ( II. 33 ) have the charge of the chariot department and of the six classes of infantry respectively. The superintendent of passports ( mudrādhyakṣa ) issued passes to inhabitants of the country or foreigners for entering into or going out and the superintendent of pastures (II. 34 ) was to see the passes and devote himself to the care of pastures. Kautilya provides that a pass (mudrā ) was to be given on payment of a māṣaka, that one could enter into or go out of a country only when one had a pass, that a person who entered without a pass was to be fined twelve paṇas and that the superintendent of pastures and his men were to examine whether persons not going by the royal road but through pastures had a pass or not and that the superintendent of pastures and his men were to convey the approach of thieves and enemies by beating drums and blowing conches and were to send messages about the entrance of enemies into pastures by means of domesticated pigeons carrying letters bear ing the official stamp or by means of smoke and fire. The nāgaraka ( the mayor of the capital or cities or the chief of the police in the capital ) was to look to the affairs of the capital ( or the big cities ). A gopa ( under the nāgaraka ) was to superin tend a group of twenty or forty families in the capital and an officer designated sthānika was to be in charge of each of four wards into which the capital was to be divided. Yāj. II. 173 mentions an officer called sthānapāla in connection with the 

finding of lost goods who appears to be the same as sthānika. The gopa and sthānika had to keep a register of the caste, gotra,

name and occupation of the men and women in their districts and also of their income and expenditure. Managers of charitable institutions had to send information to them about the heretics and travellers arriving to reside therein. Numerous rules about reporting and punishments for various defaults and wrongs are laid down, which are passed over. Manu VII. 121 and Santi 87. 10 also provide for the appointment in each city ( in the kingdom) of a high officer, who was to superintend all matters affecting the city and who had ample powers of restraint and coercion. Many of the superintendents mentioned by Kautilya occur under the same names in the Kāmasūtra e.g. gavādhyakṣa, sūtrādhyaksa, nāgaraka (explained by the com. as dandapāśika ), paṇyādhyaksa ( in V, 5. 7-10). Vide E. I. vol. 15 pp, 127-128 for a statement on the provincial adminis tration under the Guptas. 

As regards the emoluments of the officers in charge of a village, ten villages &c. Manu ( VII. 118-119 ) has some interes ting rules: The headman of a village should obtain (as his emoluments ) those articles which the villagers have to furnish every day to the king viz. food, drink, fuel and the like. The officer over ten villages should enjoy one kula 189, that over twenty villages should enjoy five kulas, the superintendent of a hundred villages should receive the revenue of one village and the high officer over a thousand villages should enjoy (the revenue of ) a town. All this, as Medhātithi says, is only approxi mate and recommendatory and was not literally followed, but 

188. The word 'pratyaham'( every day) excludes taxes on fields that are levied once a year or taxes levied on particular occasions only; while the words food, drink and fuel' exclude cattle, money &c. The word 

kula' appears to be used as a technical term. It may mean as much land as would be required for the maintenance of a family. But there is another sense given by the commentators of Manu. Sarvajña-Nārāyana quotes a text that kula means' two halas'. He and Kullūka quote Hārita to the effect that a plough (yoked acc. to dharma ) is one of eight bullocks, one of six bullocks is employed by those who want only bare maintenance, householders employ one of four bullocks, while those who in their greed want to incur heavy sin employ a plough with two bulls only. So by kula is meant as much land as can be ploughed with two ploughs to which either 8, 6 or 4 bullocks are yoked. That 6 or 8 or 12 oxen were yoked to the plough is stated in Atharva VI. 91.1 and Tai. S. V. 2. 5. 2.

Salaries of officers

only means that a salary commensurate with the position and responsibilities of each officer should be received by him. Vide Sānti 87. 6-8 for rules similar to Manu's (where the officer over a thousand villages gets as his salary the revenues of a sākhānagara). Kautilya ( in V.3) sets out the salaries of many officers and servants as follows: the salary paid to the chief mantrin, purohita and a few others has been already stated above (p. 120); the dauvārika, the superintendent of the harem ( antar vamsika), the praśāsts, the samāhartr and the sannidhātṇ were to receive 24000 panas; the princes (other than the crown prince), the nurse (māts, mother?) of the princes, nāyaka, the superinten dent in charge of justice (or commercial transactions ?) in the capital (the pauravyāvahārika ), the superintendent of royal manufactories (karmantika ), the members of the council of ministers, the rāṣtrapāla ( governor of a province), antapāla ( the guardian of the borders ) were to receive 12000 panas; the salary of the heads of śrenis ( the military corporations ?), the heads of the elephant army, cavalry, and chariot army, and the pradestrs was 8000 panas; the superintendents (below the commanders ) of infantry, cavalry, chariots and elephants, of the forest produce and elephant forests will each receive 4000; the chariot driver (anika), the army physician, the trainer of horses, carpenters, yoniposaka (?) will receive 2000; the foreteller (the reader of omens), astrologer ( who finds auspicious times for undertakings ), the reader of purānas, the sūta, māgadha ( bard), the assistants (puruṣa) of the purohita and adhyakṣas will receive 1000; trained foot-soldiers, the accountants and scribes will receive 500; musicians 250, but trumpet-blowers will receive 500; artisans ( kāru ) and craftsmen ( śilpin ) 120; servants in charge of bipeds and quadrupeds, workers doing miscellaneous things, attendants near the king, bodyguard and the officer procuring free labour (visti ) will receive 60; those appointed to do piece work (kāryayukta, v. 1. āryayukta ), the elephant driver, boys (mānavaka, a page?), mountain-diggers, all atten dants, teachers and learned men shall receive honorarium (pājā vetana) according to their merit from 500 to 1000; charioteer of the king 1000 ; spies of the five sorts ( vide above p. 129 ) will receive 1000; the village servants (like washer-man), the spies of the type of sattrin, desperado, poisoner and ascetic women will receive 500; the wandering spies (vide above p. 130) three hundred or more according to the labour involved. The superintendents in charge of a group of hundred or a thousand ( servants) were to regulate the subsistence (bhakta ), cash salary, the perquisites,152

the appointment and transfer of those under them. But there shall be no transfer of those who are the king's personal servants and of those who are appointed to guard forts and the country parts. The Sukranitisāra (I. 211) emphasizes that salaries should be in paṇas, that a king should not make a gift even of a finger-breadth of land as emolument to any servant, but that if he does give land, it should be held only for the life-time of the officer 189. Kautilya ( in II. 1) prescribes that lands may be granted as emoluments to superintendents (of the various depart ments ), the accountants, to officers called gopa and sthānika, to officers in the army, physicians, horse-trainers, but without power to sell or mortgage. Sukra II. 117–204 mentions numerous officers of the army, the treasury &c. Sukra IV. 7. 24-27 sets out the salaries of officers, when the king's income is one lakh of mudrās a year. Kaut. provides for pensions and gratuities. He says' the song and wives of those that die while on duty whall get subsistence and wages. Young children, aged persons and ailing persons related to the ( dying ) officers shall be shown favour. On occasions of funerals, sickness or child birth the king shall bestow money and honours on them'. The Mahābhārata (Sabha. 5.54 ) prescribes 190 that it is the duty of the king to support the wives of those that meet death or calamities in the king's service. Sukra II. 406-411 contains very modern-looking rules about sick-leave, casual leave, pension after 40 years of service &c. 

The above provisions from Kautilya's work show how States in ancient India engaged in almost all the activities of modern States, had an equally complicated machinery of administration and an army of high and low officers. It will also be noticed how, as in India at present, comparatively very high salaries were paid to ministers and heads of departments as compared with the salaries of clerks (e. g. the ordinary clerks received five hundred, while the chief minister and samāharts, the

If all the different officers mentioned in the works on dharmaśāstra, arthaśāstra and in inscriptions be collected together, they will make a formidably long list. A list from one inscription is set out below as a sample. 191 Vide Vogel's ' Inscriptions from Chamba' pp. 120-136 for explanations of about 30 titles of officers occurring in the inscriptions. 

A few words must be said about local administration. The word grāma occurs even in the Rgveda, In Rg. I. 114, 1 the poet offers his praise and prayer to Rudra so that he hopes that 'all bipeds and quadrupeds may fare well and all beings in this village may be free from disease and may enjoy prosperity :: 198 In Rg. V, 54.8 'heroes (or men) conquering grāmas' are mentioned ( grāmajito yathā narah). In Rg. X. 62. 11 Manu is styled 'grāmapi' and the bestower of a thousand (cows ?) and in Rg. X. 107.5 it is said that the 'grāmani who is endowed with (or dispenses ) dakṣiṇā ( cows or wealth) walks in front ( of the village people )'. In the Tai. $. II. 5.4.4 it is said the prosperous are three indeed, viz. the learned brāhmaṇa, the village headman (grāmaṇi) and the rājanya ( warrior)'. 19 In the Tai. Br. I. 1.4.8, the consecration of fire for a vaibya sacrificer is made with the mantra 'manostvā grāmanyo vratapate vratenādadhāmi' (where Manu is styled grāmaṇi). In the Sat. Br. V. 4. 4. 19 the grāmaṇi is said to be stronger than his co-sharer (sajāta). Vide S. B. E. vol. 41 p. 111. We saw above

(p. 111 ) that among the ratnins, grāmanı (the village headman) was one. Grāma did not necessarily mean a village but may have been applied to a town ( though not a capital). The head man of a village was called grāmani, grāmika or grāmadhipati (in Manu VII. 115-116, Kaut. III. 10 ), grāmakūta ( in inscrip tions e. g. E. I vol. VII. p. 39 of sake 852, E. I. vol. VII. p. 183, 188 ) and Pattakila, modern Patil (in Ujjain plates of 975 and 1023 A, D. in I. A, vol. 6 p. 51, 53, vol. 18 p. 322 grant of Bhoja in samvat 1076, 1. A. 16 p. 254, E. I. vol. XI. p. 304, 310 of sainvat 1176 ). In an inscription of the 13th century from the Poona District we have the form pattela' (E. I. vol. VII. at p. 183 ). The word 'gāvunda' for a village headman in the Canarese Districts is derived from grāmakūta ( E, I. vol. VII p. 183). Paithinasi 193 quoted by Aparārka p. 239 states that the food of a grāmakūta could not be partaken by a brāhmana, The Gathāgaptaśati frequently refers to the great influence of the grāmani and the love adventures of his son in the village (1 30-31, VII. 24). The Kāmasūtra states (V. 5.5 ) that the young son of a grāmādhipati had certain women of the village at his beck and call. 194 According to the Sukranitisāra I. 193 a grāma (village ) is one krośa in extent and yields a revenue of one thousand silver karṣas, while half a village is called palli and half of palli was kumbha. Hemādri in Dānakhanda (p. 288 ) quotes from the Mārkandeya-purāna definitions of pura, kheta, kharvata and grāma. Yāj. II. 167 makes a distinc tion between grāma, kharvata and nagara (town) as regards the extent of the pasture lands to be preserved round them. Baudhāyana Dh. S. II. 3. 58 and 60 condemns residence in a city for a religious brāhmana where the body is covered with dust which enters one's mouth and eyes and recommends for residence a grāma abounding in water, fuel, fodder, fuel-sticks, kusa grass, flowers, which is full of well-to-do people, endowed with industrious people, where the majority are āryas and which cannot be entered by robbers. In the Sabhāparva 5,84 five officers of a village are referred to. It appears that from being a very high officer (a ratnin) in Vedic times the grāmani was reduced in his influence, came to be appointed by the king alone and the office became hereditary and could be given permanently.

Local administration 

155 

E.I. vol. VII. p. 177, 188, 189 195. The Sukranitisāra (II. 120-21 ) states that there were to be six officers in a village and (II. 428-29) prescribes their caste, viz. sāhasādhipati (i.e. a magistrate to deal with wrongs involving force) was to be a ksatriya, grāmanetr (the headman) a brahmana, bhāgahāra (the person collecting the state land revenue) a ksatriya, lekhaka (a scribe, corresponding to the modern kulkarni in the Deccan ) should be a kāyastha, sulkagrāha (the toll-gate keeper) a vaisya, pratihāra (the guard at the gate of the village wall ) a sūdra. Sukra ( in II. 170-175 ) sets out their duties. The headman was to be alert in protecting the villagers like their parents from thieves, robbers and from the State officers, the bhāgahāra was to devote special care to the tending of trees; the lekhaka was to be skilled in accounting and proficient in several spoken languages; the pratihāra was to be of strong body, proficient in arms, humble and to call the villagers with the respect due to each; and the toll-gate keeper was to levy tolls in such a way that sellers did not incur loss of capital spent by them. From Kaut. III. 10 it appears that the village headman had the authority to inflict fines in certain cases e. g. when the headman (grāmika ) had to travel on some business of the whole village the villagers were to accompany him by turns, but if they failed to do so they had to pay a fine of one pana or a half paṇa. Similarly, if a villager does not co-operate in the getting up of a show (prekṣā) in the village, he or his people would not be allowed to gee the show and he was to be fined if he clandestinely saw it. In villages, particularly in Karnataka and South India and in brahmadeya grants ( to learned brāhmaṇas ) the village assemblies (sabha ) carried on local administration. From the Kotavumachgi Inscription of Cālukya Vikramāditya V dated sake 934 ( 1012 A, D.) it appears that Ummachige was a great educational centre in the 11th century and 104 Mahājanas of the village were entrusted with the proper conduct of worship in the temple, the imparting of education, the feeding of ascetics, the supply of water to the village and the punishment of criminals (E. I. vol. 20.p. 59). Vide Gopalan's 'History of the Pallavas of Kāñol' pp. 93, 158-157 for the working of the village assemblies (sabhās ) from the 9th century onwards, but as he observes (p. 154 ),'we do not know the nature of the rules that regulated their working, their exact sphere of action and their

relation to the central government.' An inscription of king Parantaka I (907-947 A, D.) at Uttaramerur deals with several classes of village committees that were appointed by vote ( Annual Report of Archæological Survey of India, 1904-5 pp. 131 ff). Five committees, viz. annual comınittee, garden committee, tank committee, gold committee (for currency or for collecting taxes in cash), pañcavāra committee, are des cribed and reference is made to a sixth called 'justice committee and the mode of election and the qualifications and disquali fications of members are described in detail (pp. 142-145 ). Prof. Nilkanth Sastri in 'Studies in Cola History' (pp. 131-175) publishes the text of two Parāntaka Inscriptions with English translation and exhaustive notes. Vide also E. I. vol. 22 p. 5 for resolutions of the sabhā at Manur to be followed in future meetings, the qualifications in property, education and character of the members &c., E. I. vol. 24 p. 28 about the regulations of sabhā from two Uttaramallur Inscriptions and E. I. vol. 23 p. 22 for a note on the pañcavāra committee. For village communities as described in Buddhist works in the 7th century B.O., vide Rhys Davids in 'Buddhist India' pp. 45–51. It appears from Pāṇini and the commentary Kāśikā thereon that certain craftsmen were attached hereditarily to the village, were probab ly paid a certain part of the crop produce yearly for their services and corresponded to the modern village servants (call ed the twelve bulutedūrs ) in the Deccan. For an account of these balutedūrs, vide Grant Duff's History of the Marathas' (Bombay ed. Of 1863, vol. I. pp. 23-27). For example, Pāṇini (VI. 2. 62 ) teaches the accent of a compound word formed from 'grāma' with another word denoting 'silpin' (craftsman), such as grāmanāpita (village barber) or grāmakulāla ( village potter ), which are two examples given by the Kaśik, on this sūtra. From Pāṇini V. 4.95 ('grāmakauṭābhyam ca takṣpah') it may be inferred that a carpenter also was a village servant as in modern times in the Deccan. Bphaspati 196 contains very

important information about local administration in villages. A compact formed among villages, guilds and corporations (gana ) is called a samaya ( agreement);such an agreement must be observed in times of distress and for acts of dharma. Two, three or five persons shall be appointed as advisers of groups ; their advice shall be followed by the villagers, the guilds, the corporations and others. Examples of agreement as to times of distress are: When there is drought, there may be a compact that for the performance of a sacrifice to the planets or the like each field or house should contribute so much money or when there is trouble from robbers, each house should send one able-bodied and armed man. Then examples are given by Bphaspati himself about acts of dharma. The village people should put down in writing what work they are going to do, such as the repair of a house for their assembly, a shed for distributing water to travellers, a temple, a tank or a garden, the performance of the necessary saṁskāras ( upanayana or funeral rites ) of the poor and helpless, gifts for the performance of sacrifices, prevention of famine-stricken groups of families from coming. Such conyen tions would be proper and should be respected by all the villagers. Whoever being able to carry out such agreements violates them should be punished with loss of all wealth and banishment. Bphaspati further says 17 that the heads of families, guilds and ganas and the inhabitants of towns and forts may pronounce the two punishments of reprimand and condemnation against wrong-doers and may also excommunicate them and the punish ments and favours declared by them according to rules should be approved of by the king, since such power is regarded by the sages as delegated to them. For ejecting out of the village one who is not guilty of theft or adultery with another's wife the village headman or the village was liable to pay, according to Kautilya III. 10, a fine of 24 paṇas. It will be seen from what has preceded that village administration was self-contained and would function whatever Government might happen to be at the centre. The central Government did not very much interfere with local administration, except in the matter of land revenue, protection against invasion and exercised only general control and supervision. The village communities were miniature states.

History of Dharmaśāstra 

(Voi. 

There was a great deal of decentralization or devolution of authority from the central government to the village committees and authorities. They were also entrusted with civil and criminal justice, as we shall see later on. For further details on the organization of a village as a political unit, Dr. R. C. Majmudar's 'Corporate life in Ancient India'chap. II. pp. 135 ff. and Fick (p. 161) may be consulted. Just as there was some organization in villages in general, so also guilds ( śrepis ) and groups ( ganas ) had their own regulations and conventions. In XI. 1 Kautilya refers to ksatriya guilds in the countries of Kambhoja and Suraṣtra that maintained themselves on husbandry and followed the profession of arms ( vide above p. 88 n. 120 ). In III. 14 he refers to guilds of workmen or labourers ( sangha bhrtāh). Manu (I. 118) declares that his work deals not only with the enduring dharm is of countries, castes and families, but also with the dharmas of heretical sects (pāṣanda) and of groups (gaña). Manu (VIII. 41 ) requires the righteous king to consider carefully the dharmas of castes, countries, guilds and families ( to find out whether they are opposed to the Vedas ) and uphold those dharmas ( that are not opposed ) as binding (on those respective persons). Yāj. II. 192 prescribes that the king should respect the usages and conventions of occupational guilds, merchants, heretical sects, and groups (corporations &c.) and allow them to pursue the course of action they had followed from ancient times. Narada ( samayasyānapa karma, verses 2-6) and Bphaspati quoted in the Viramitrodaya ( vyavahāra ) contain very important directions as to what conventions of guilds the king should respect and what he is not bound to respect. Nārada says that the king should enforce the conventions agreed upon by heretic sects, naigamas (merchants), śrenis and other groups residing in the country or the capital. The king may allow them to follow their special rules (e. g. speaking the truth ), their special actions ( begging in the morn ing without having taken a bath ), their mode of meeting (on hearing a drum being beaten), the means of livelihood they have been used to (e. g. dressing as an ascetic). But the king should prohibit (out of their usages and conventions) such as are opposed to the king's interest, or are disapproved of by the people in general, would be ruinous to the purposes of the king. The king should not tolerate their creating factious groups among themselves, taking up arms for a purpose detrimental to the State, and causing injury to each other. The king should specially curb those who cause dissensions among the several

groups ; if they are connived at in these activities they might cause terrible danger. 198 A good deal has already been said about guilds and corporations in H. Dh, vol. II. pp. 66-69. Among inscriptions, the following may be studied : the Nasik Ins. No. 15 of the time of Abhira Iśvarasena (E. I. vol. VIII p. 88, where the śrenis of potters, oil-pressers and water-drawers receive deposits), Junnar Buddhist cave Inscription (A, S. W. I. vol. 4 p. 97, where a deposit of money with śrenis of bamboo-workers and braziers is made), Gupta Inscription No. 16 p.70(an endowment was entrusted to the guild of oil-men, whose head was Jivanta), Gupta Inscript ions, No. 18 p.79 (silk weavers from Lāta coming to Dasapura and building a Sun temple ), E. I. vol. 15 p. 263, E. I. vol. 18 p. 326 and p. 30, E. I. 16 p. 332, E. I. vol. I. 155 ( of 933 saivat, inscrip tion at Gopagiri, modern Gwalior, where the guilds of oil-millers and of gardeners are mentioned), I. 184 (Pehoa inscription, where a guild of 34 horse-dealers from different countries, some being brāhmaṇas, agreed to impose upon themselves and their customers tithes to be distributed to certain temples ). Rhys Davids in 'Buddhist India '(pp. 90-96 ) gives a list of the 18 guilds that probably existed in the times of the early Buddhist works (though two or three of them are of doubtful existence) and the number of which ( 18 ) is sometimes mentioned in the Jātakas (as in Mūgapakkhajātaka No. 538, vol. VI p. 14 in Cowell's tr.). For further details about the working and organization of guilds, vide chap. I of Dr. R. C. Majmudar's 

Corporate life in ancient India', and ' Indian Culture' vol. 6 (for 1940 ) pp. 421-28 (on the economic guilds of blacksmiths, barbers &b. in the Kuṣāṇa period). 

In numerous places rules are laid down about the qualifica tions of the ordinary servants ( parivāra, bhrtya or anujivin) of kings, how they should conduct themselves, how servants should

find out whether the king is pleased or displeased with them. Vide Kautilya V. 4, Virātaparva 4, 12-50 ( where the refrain of most verses is 'sa rajavasatim vaset'), Matsyapurāṇa 216 (the whole of which is quoted in the Rajadharmakāpda pp. 24-27 and in the Rājanitiprakāśa pp. 189-192), Agni purāṇa 221, Vispudharmottara II. 25. 2-28, Kām. IV. 10-11, V. 1-4, 6, 9, 11-63 ( most of which are quoted in the Rājanitirat nākara pp. 51-58), Sukranitisāra II. 54-68, 205-253. On the word' akṣudrapariṣad ' occurring in Yāj. I. 310 ( where the Mit. has the reading 'akṣudrosparusaḥ') Visvarūpa quotes a passage from Saṅkha 199'a haisa (gwan i, e a good king ) surrounded by vultures (greedy servants) is not desirable, but a vulture ( i.e. a greedy king ) surrounded by hamsas ( servants of spotless character) may be preferred.' The Rājanitiprakāśa (p. 185 ) quotes the same passage from Saṅkha-Likhita with an addition viz. faults arise from those who surround the king and such faults are enough to ruin (the king). Therefore the (king) should first before engaging his servants) put down in writing whether servants are endowed with learning, character and good family.' Sukra inculcates loyalty on servants in the following remarkable 200 words 'one should not forsake a good master when he is in adversity. Should not one always and quickly desire the welfare of one's protector whose salt (lit. food) one has eaten with honour even once' (II. 246-247)? This senti ment pervaded most Hindu servants in ancient and medieval times, even under foreign rulers professing a different religion. The Rājanitiprakāśa p. 176 quotes a fine verse from the Garuda purāṇa as to matters to be principally considered in selecting servants, which are four, vis education, character, family and

actions, just as gold is tested in four ways, viz. by weighing it or by rubbing it (on a touchstone), by cutting it and by heating it.&01 

Some responsibilities of the Government or king in ancient India towards the people will now be dealt with. From Kautilya (II. 29 and II, 34 ) we find that the State made great efforts for the rearing of cattle, made stringent rules for their protection and for the provision of pastures. Manu VIII. 237, Yāj. 11. 167, Matsya 227. 24 also make provision for pastures round villages, towns and cities. Kautilya requires the superintendent of cattle to classify cattle as calves, steers, tameables, draught oxen, bulls to be yoked, stud-bulls, bulls meant for carts, cattle meant for meat and buffaloes meant for carrying loads or for being yoked, pregnant cows, milch cattle &c. and to mark them and note in a register of beasts the branded marks, natural marks, colour, the distance between the horns. He prescribes corporal punishments and fine for those who unauthorizedly kill or steal cattle or incite others to do so. He prescribes even the amount of fodder, oil cakes, bran and salt on which different kinds of animals put to different kinds of work are to be fed. From the Mahābhārata also we learn that even princes 80l« went to supervise and enumerate the herds of cattle belonging to the State, Vide Vanaparva 239. 4 and 240. 4-6. Even such a grammatical work as the Mahābhāgya incidentally gives expression to the view that a country's wealth consists in its food-crops and in abundance of cattle. 

We saw above (pp. 130-131) that spies were to be employed (acc. to Kāut.) to test whether State officers took bribes. Yaj. (1. 336, 338, 339 ) prescribes that the king should protect his subjects from the harassment caused by kūyjasthas (the account. ants and scribes), that he should ascertain the doings of the State officers through spies, honour those that are well-conducted and severely punish those who are badly behaved and should deprive those who take bribes of their wealth and banish them from the country. Vide also Manu VII. 122-124 and Visnudharmottara for similar rules. The Pancatantra (I. 343) has the same verse as

Yaj. I. 336 ( except the last pada ). Medhātithi on Manu IX. 294 remarks that the kingdom has no fear of ruin if kantakas (wicked people who are like thorns) are removed and justice is properly administered and that kantakas are generally under the protection of the queen, the prince, the king's favourites or the commander-in-chief. 

Great attention was paid to agriculture. In the Sabhāparva 5.77 the king 80% is advised to have large tanks in different parts of the country full of water and to see that agriculture did not depend on the rains alone. Megasthenes (Fragment I. p. 30 of McCrindle's work ) notes that the greater part of the soil of India was in his day under irrigation and consequently bore two crops in the year. Even from the Tai. S. V. 1, 7. 3 it. appears that two crops were grown in the year ( tasmad dvih samvatsarasya sasyam pacyate ). The Vāj. S. 18. 12 contains a list of twelve different kinds of crops such as rice, yava, wheat, mūṣa, sesame, mudga, masūra &c, and the Bṛ. Up. VI. 3. 13 enumerates ton kinds of grain ( grāmyāṇi dhānyāni). In the Hathigumphā Inscription of Khāravela king of Kalinga (E. I. vol. 20 p. 71 ) it is stated that (p. 79 ) a canal which had already been opened in the 103rd year of the Nanda kings (i. e. in the 4th century B. C.) was extended by him in the 5th year of his reign. Rudradaman at great expense from his own treasury without any additional taxation or demand for free labour restored the famous Sudarsana lake near Junāgad (E. I. vol. VIII. p. 36 ) that had been built by the Governors of Candragupta and Asoka and been breached by floods. Irrigation had been made uge of from Vedic times. Rg. VII. 49.2 refers to rivers and springs naturally flowing and to channels that were dug up, South Indian Inscriptions show how the Pallavas and kings of other dynasties built tanks which were named after the kings themselves or after some distinguished chief of the locality and that are in existence even now. Vide S. I I. Vol. II part III, p. 351, E. I. vol. IV p. 152 (mention of tank called 'parame śvaratatāka'), 8. I. 1 vol. I p. 150, E. I. vol. VIII p. 145 ( for mention of rājatatāka near which four nivartanas were granted by Cārudevi). The great engineer Suyya under Avantivarman of Kashmir ( 833-858 ) successfully dammed the river Vitastā with the result that a khari of rice which could formerly be purchased for 200 dināras could be had after the great irrigation

work for 36 dināras (vide Rājatarangiṇi V. 84-117). Kautilya (II. 24 ) refers to the various ways in which crops could be rais ed with water and the revenue to be demanded in each case, e. g. those who watered crops with manual labour had to pay 1/5th of the produce, those who carried water on their shoulders paid Ith, those who watered their crops by means of water-lifts or water-wheels from natural springs paid one-third and those who raised water from rivers, lakes, tanks and wells paid Ith. He notes that sugarcane crops are a heavy responsibility, as they are liable to many evils and entail great expense. Sugarcane had been grown even in the times of the Atharvaveda (I. 34. 5). The Sukranitisāra (IV. 4.60 ) remarks that the king should see to it that there is plenty of water in his kingdom by digging wells, wells with steps, tanks, lakes &c. Megasthenes (fragment XXXIV p. 86 of McCrindle's ' Ancient India ') says that some superintend the rivers, measure the land as is done in Egypt and inspect the sluices by which water is let out from the main canals into their branches so that every one may have an equal share of it. Kaut. (IV.3) devotes a special chapter to the king's duty to save the kingdom from national calamities, viz. fires, floods, diseases, famines, rats, wild elephants (or beasts ), snakes and evil spirits. He gives practical hints for human and religious remedies and rites against these calamities. The measures against famine suggested by him are: the king may 

provide the people with seeds and food, start works for those who are distressed, distribute either his own collection of provis ions or that of the rich or call for help from his allies, tax the rich and make them disgorge their wealth, migrate to other countries that have abundant harvests. National calamities are called iti, which are six: excessive rainfall, drought, rats, locusts, parrots and too close presence of foreign kings 803. The work of Kāmandaka states that calamities are either divine or human and that the first are of five kinds. In another place he gives & longer list of calamities. There are several references in ancient and medieval works to severe famines. In the Chāndogya Upaniṣad I. 10. 1-3 we

have the story of Uṣasti Cakrāyana who took from another's plate kulmāṣas that the other had been eating (i. e, he took ucchista food), when the country of Kurus was overwhelmed with a shower of hail (or by locusts ). The Bālakāṇda (chap. 9) refers to a famine in the country of Anga under Romapada. The Nirukta II. 10 refers to a drought in the dim past for twelve years in the kingdom of Santanu. A Mauryan inscription from Mahāsthāna (ancient Pundranagara) shows that Gapdaka coins were distributed and also corn to famine-stricken people (J. A. S. B. for 1932 p. 123). The Sohagpur Copperplate Inscription (of Mauryan times) contains an order of the mahāmātras of Srāvasti that the dravya storehouses were to be spent only in case of drought. Vide Annals of B. O. R. Institute, vol. XI p. 32ff., E. I vol. 2% p. 1 and J. A.S. B. vol. VII (for 1941) part 2 p. 203. The Rājatarangiṇi records several times the occurrence of famines in Kashmir at different periods (e. g. vide II. 17-54, V. 270-278, VII. 1219 ff). The Manimekhalai (chap. 28) speaks of a famine for twelve years at Kañol in South India. There was a terrible famine (called the famine of Durgādeyi) for twelve years in the Deccan about 1396 A. D. ( vide Grant Duff's "History of the Marāthas' vol. I. p. 43). Vide E. I. vol. 15 p. 12 for a reference to a severe famine in sake 1313 when paddy could not be had even at the rate of ten nāļis a pananı. 

It has been shown ( in H. Dh. vol. II. pp. 113, 369, 856-858) how it was the king's duty to support learned brāhmaṇas, to hold assemblies of poets and learned men, to make gifts of land to educational institutions and to promote learning in all ways. Vṛddha-Hārita VII. 229-230 says that only learned brāhmaṇas who are endowed with tapas are proper objects of the king's bounty. Some emperors like Harṣa went far beyond what was reasonable. The Chinese pilgrim tells us ( Beal's 'Buddhist Records &c.' vol. I pp. 214, 233 ) that at the end of every five years Harsa held an assembly (pariṣad ) at Prayāga and gave away all in charity. The Sukranitisāra ( I. 368-369 ) holds that a king should be on the look-out for educated men, should appoint them to offices suited to their education, should honour every year those who have attained eminence in learning and the arts and take measures for the advancement of learning and arts. It has already been shown how this had been followed by ancient and medieval Indian kings to the letter. A comparison with the British Indian Government in the 18th century and the first decades of the 19th will be highly interesting. After the battle of

Er Expense on education under British rule 

165 

Plassey in 1757 the British East India Company got three such rich provinces as Bengal, Bihar and Orissa. During over 50 years the only thing that was done by the ruling power for the encouragement of learning among Indians was that in 1780 Warren Hastings started a Madrassa of Muslim religious learn ing at Calcutta with a moulvi and 40 stipendiaries and Lord Cornwallis founded a Sanskrit college at Benares in 1792. When the East India Company's Charter was renewed in 1813 the only provision that was made for education and encouragement of learning (by George III, 1813 chap. 155, clause 43 ) was ' that it shall and may be lawful for the Governor General-in-Council to direct that out of any surplus which may remain of the rents, revenues and profits arising from the said territorial acquisitions, after defraying the expenses of the military, civil and commercial establishments and paying the interest of the debt, a sum of not less than one lakh of rupees in each year shall be set apart and applied to the revival and improvement of literature and the encouragement of the learned natives of India and for the introduction and promotion of a knowledge of the sciences among the inhabitants of the British territories in India'. Detailed comment is not called for. More than 50 years after British rule began, when at least half of what is British India now had come into the hands of the British, and when the yearly income must have been many crores of rupees, the sum of u lalch of rupees was to be set apart for educa tion of two kinds (Eastern and Western) in the whole of the then British India. Further this provision was not compulsory but only permissive, and was to be availed of only if some surplus was left after everything else had been provided for. 

As in western Jurisprudence, so in India the king was looked upon as parens patriæ, the protector or guardian of all minors. Gaut.206 X. 48-49 and Manu VIII. 27 prescribe that the king shall protect the property of a minor until he attains majority or until he returns from his teacher's house. Medhātithi on Manu VIIL 27 says that the minor's relatives like the uncles may contend that one of them is the guardian of the minor's property but it is the king who is to see that the minor's property is kept

safe. Baud. Dh. S. II. 2. 43, Vas. 16. 8-9, Viṣnu Dh. 8. III. 65, Saökha-Likhita contain a similar rule. Nār. (rpādāpa 35) declared that a person was a minor till the 16th year. Manu VIII, 28–29, Vispudharmagūtra II. 65 extend the same rule and say that the king must take care of barren women, women who have no sons, women whose families are extinct, wives and widows who are faithful to their husbands and of those who are afflicted with disease. Nār. 80s as quoted by Medhātithi says that if a woman has nobody in her husband's or father's family to protect her, then it is the king who is to protect her. Kaut 206 (II. 1) makes it a duty of the elders of the village to take care of and increase the properties of minors and of temples. 

It was the special concern of the king to see that proper weights and measures were used. Kaut. (II. 19) as stated above (pp.145-146) provides for a special superintendent of weights and measures. Vas.207 ( 19. 13 ) and Manu VIII. 403 provide that all weights and measures must be duly marked (or stamped), that once in six months they must be re-examined and that the weights and measures for objects required by the class of householders must be guarded against falsifications. Yāj. II. 240 and Viṣpudharmasutra V. 122 prescribe as punishment the highest ammercement for those who fabricate false balances, edicts, measures and coins and also for those who use them in their transactions. The Nitivākyāmrta (p. 98 ) requires the king to be vigilant as regards merchandise, balances and measures, since there is none who excels traders in stealing people's money before their very eyes. 208 Vide Alberuni (tr, by Sachau) vol. I chap. XV about weights and measures current in India in the 11th century. 

Another important responsibility of the king concerned thefts. Aśvapati, king of Kekaya, boasted that in his kingdom there was no thief, no close-fisted person, no drinker of wine,

(Chan, Up. V. 11.5). Ap. Dh. S. 899 (II. 10. 26. 6-8) lays down that the officers should protect a city against theft for one yojana round it and in the case of villages for one krośa round them and that whatever is stolen within those limits must be returned to the owners by the officers. Gautama X. 46-47, Manu VIII. 40, Yāj. II. 36, Visṇudharmasūtra III. 66-67, Sānti 75. 10 prescribe that the king should recover from the thief stolen property and restore it to the owner ( without distinction of caste ), that if he cannot restore it he should compensate the sufferer from his own treasury, and that, if he retained the property recovered from a thief or did not make efforts to catch the thief and compensate the owner, the king incurred sin. Kaut III. 16 contains a similar rule.210 Visvarūpa on Yāj. II. 38 quotes a prose passage 211 of Br. with a similar import. The Viṣnudharmottara €12 ( II. 61. 52 ) remarks that if a person is robbed by his own servants then he (the king ) may endeavour to recover it from the servants (by threatening or beating them), but need not restore it from his own treasury. Yāj II. 270-272, Nār. (pariśiṣta 16-21 ) and Kāt. 13 give further directions, viz. the thief should be made to restore the property stolen or its price; if the thief cannot be found the officers and wardens of the country pay the price of the stolen articles; the property stolen in the village should be made good by the headman of the village, if the thief's foot-steps

are not traced as going out of the village ; if the theft takes place in a pasture land or forest (and the thief is not found), the owner of it should be made to pay; if however the theft is not committed in a forest but on the road then the officers appointed to arrest thieves should be made to pay; the whole village may be made to pay the compensation when the theft is within the boundaries of a village but outside the limit of the residential quarters, if the footsteps of the thief are not traced as going out of the village ; if the theft takes place beyond one krośa from a village then the surrounding five or ten villages may be made to pay the compensation. Yāj. II. 271 and Kāt. mention an officer called 'cauroddhartā' ('or coroddharta'). The * cauroddharanika'(thief-catcher) is an officer mentioned in numerous inscriptions e. g. in the Palitana plates of Dharasena II of Valabhi in Gupta year 252 (E. I. vol. XI at p. 83 ), in the inscription of Nārāyanapāla where we have both cauroddharanika and kottapāla, modern Kotwal (I. A. vol. XV p. 304) and in the grant of Ballālasena quoted above (p. 153, n. 191). Kautilya IV. 13 also gives similar rules and mentions an officer called *corarajjuka' who has to make good the loss of merchandise by theft between two villages or lands that are not pasture lands. 

The first quality required in a king according to Yāj. I. 309 quoted above (p. 44) is great energy and Kaug. also (in VI. 1) ment ions 'great energy' (mahotsāha) among the qualities called 'ābhi gāmika'. Works on dharmaśāstra and arthaśāstra emphasize the fact that a king must always be full of activity and must not be lethargic or fatalistic. In the Mahābhārata the topic of human effort and daiva (fate or destiny) comes up for treatment in numerous places and is put in the mouth of several characters with different emphasis according to circumstances. In Adi 1. 246-247, 89.7-10, Sabhā 46. 16, 47. 36, 58. 14, Vanaparva 179. 27-28, Udyoga 8. 52, 40. 32, 159. 4, 186. 18, Aśramavāsika 10. 29 the emphasis is on daiva as all powerful, it being said that human effort is useless as against daiva. A golden mean is advocated in Adi. 123. 21, Sabha 16. 12, Udyoga 79, 5-6, Santi 56. 14-15, Sauptika 2. 3, in all of which it is said that worldly affairs require both purusakāra (effort) and daiva. In certain other passages it is recommended that effort is superior to daiva and that one's business is to make efforts and not to care for fate; e.g. in Drona 152, 27, Santi 27. 32, 58. 13-16, 163. 50, Anuśāsana 6.1 ff, Sauptika 2. 12-13 and 23-24. A few of the striking passages indicative of the three lines of thought are

set out in the note below. $14 Energetic action, according to Santi. 58. 13-15, is declared by Brhaspati to be the root of rājadharma. Nectar was obtained and asuras were killed by the gods by means of energetic action and Indra secured his high position in heaven and here by energetic action. Br. makes the characteristic remark 'A man who is a hero of action leads those who are heroes in speech and the latter are seen to cater for the pleasures of the former and wait humbly on him'. The Bhagavadgita in its final summing up of the philosophy of Activism without an eye to the fruit of it but from a sense of duty declares (XVIII. 13-16 ) ' that in the Saṅkhya philosophy five categories are mentioned as conducive to the accomplishment of all actions viz. the place, the agent, various kinds of instruments, diverse and separate activities and lastly daiva; that whatever action a man commences either with his body, words or mind these five are its causes, whether the action be righteous ( nyāyya ) or the opposite of it, and that this being the true state of things (i, e, the fruit depending on the co-operation of five elements and not on one alone ) that man who regards himself alone as bringing about a result is a fool and has no correct perception.' Kautilya also (I. 19 last two verses ) says' activity (utthāna) is the root of wealth and the opposite of it is the root of evil. In the absence of activity the loss of present and future acquisitions is sure; by activity a king can obtain his desired object and plenty of wealth'. Yāj. ( 1. 349 and 351 ) states that success in undertakings depends upon both fate and human effort, yet fate is nothing but the

human effort of past lives manifesting its effect ( in this life) and that as on a single wheel a chariot cannot progress, so fate cannot accomplish anything without human effort. Yāj. I. 350 refers to other views viz. fate alone leads to success, human effort alone does so, that success results of itself (without any cause ), while others say that it is Time that brings about all results. Manu VII. 205, Matsya 221, 1-12 (all of which are quoted in the Rājanītiprakāśa pp. 313-314) and Viṣnudharmottara II. 66 ( which has the same verses as in Matsya 221 ) inculcate the same doctrine as that of Yāj. I. 349 and 351 and emphasize that one must always make efforts (tasmāt sadotthānavatā hi bhavyain-Matsya 221. 12). The Matsyapurāṇa 221. 2 empha tically 815 states that effort is superior. Medhatithi on Manu IV. 137 quotes a subhāṣitu those devoid of effort are engaged in calculating the aspects of planets; there is nothing impossible of accomplishment for those who are determined and who are able to put forth spirited efforts. Kaut. (IX. 4 last two verses ), Kām. V, 11, XII. 3-11 emphasize the importance of strenuous efforts. Sukranitisāra (I. 46-58) holds a long disquisition on effort and dair. It contains the following fine sentiments (I. 48-49): 

Men of intellect whose career is honourable regard human effort as the highest (and not fate), while impotent men not being able to make efforts have recourse to fate; but all is centred in both daiva and effort'. Vide Rājanitiprakāśa pp. 312-315 and Nitimayūkha pp. 52-53 for further remarks on daiva and effort. In one place the Mahābhārata (Udyoga 127. 19 ) contains the bravest and loftiest advice 'man should always press forward ( make efforts ), should never bend; striy ing is manliness; one may even break at a point which is not the joint, but should never bend 216, The Brhat-Parāsara smrti X pp. 282-283 contains a long discourse on daiva and puruṣakāra. Vide Vāyu 9. 60-61 and Mārk. purāna 2. 61-62 and 23. 25-26 for similar passages on daiva and effort. 

An important doctrine of the writers on Arthaśāstra is more or less based on the necessity of utsāha, viz. the doctrine of three

saklus, i. e. of utsāha, prabhu (or prabhāva) and mantra. These three occur in the Mahābhārata (Aśramavāsika 7. 6). The S. V. p. 46 quotes a sūtra of Gautama (not found in the printed Dh. S.) the three saktis, viz. prabhu, mantra and utsāha are based on that (kośa).2164 In VI. 2 Kautilya defines mantra-sakti as the power of the knowledge (of statecraft ), prabhusakti as the power of treasury and army and utsāhasakti as the force of the king's bravery. 817 Kautilya (IX. 1 ) holds a discussion about the relative superiority of these three and gives it as his opinion (as against that of the ācāryas ) that prabhusakti is superior to utsāhasakti and that mantraśakti is superior to prabhusakti. Kām. XV. 32 defines in the three thus : 'the employment of the proper line of policy out of the six upāyas ( sandhi, vigraha &c.) is called mantraśakti; a full treasury and army constitute prabhusakti and activity of the strong is called utsāhasakti; the king possessed of all these three becomes the conqueror, The Nitivākyāmsta (sadguṇyasamuddeśa) p. 322 defines them in the same way.819 According to the Dasakumāracarita 2£0 VIII the goal (or purpose) of a king is determined by mantra (consul tation with ministers about policy ), commencement of actions (for securing the goal) is due to prabhāva and the successful termination of undertakings is brought about by energy. The Parasuramapratāpa (folio 15a) quotes a verse which defines 

prabhusakti' differently viz. as the power to command. Vide also Agnipurāna 241. 1, Mānasollāsa II. 8-10 pp. 91-94. Kām. ( XIII. 41-58 ) brings together the numerous activities of the king. 

A king endowed with valour has to employ several means (upāyas) to extend his dominions and to keep his hold on his own people. According to the Rāmāyana V. 41. 2-3, Manu VII. 109, Yāj. I. 346, Sukra IV. 1. 27 and others the

upāyas are four viz. sīma (conciliation), dana ( giving gifts or presents), bheda (causing dissensions) and daṇda (punishment or depriving of property or causing bodily harm ), 281 In the Hāthigumpha Inscription, the king Khāravela (latter half of 2nd century B. C.) states that in the 10th year of his reign he sent, following the policy of danda, sandhi and sāma, an expedition against Bharatvarṣa, conquered that land and obtained jewels and precious things ( E. I vol. XX pp. 79, 88). This shows that the theory of the upāyas must have been evolved several centuries before the Christian era. Some others such as Kām. XVII. 3, Matsya 222, %, Agnipurāṇa 226. 5-6, Bārhaspatyasutra V. 1-3, Viṣnudharmottara II. 146-149 add three more to the above four. Sabhā 5.21 mentions the number seven and Vanaparva 150.42 mentions sāma, dāna, bheda, danda and upeksa. About the additional three there is some difference of opinion, most holding that the three are māyā, upekśā and indrajāla (Kām., Agnipurāna ), while the Bārhaspatyasūtra (V. 263 ) says they are māyā, upekṣā and vadha and others say they that are māyā, akṣa (dice) and indrajāla (Sarasvativilāsa p. 42 ). Māyā means 'deceitful trick'. The Viṣnudharmottara II. 148 gives illustrations, such as tying a firebrand to the tail of a bird that often perches on the enemy's camp to produce the delusion that a meteor ( an evil omen) fell down from the sky. Kām. XVII. 54 cites the example of Bhima's meeting Kicaka dressed as Draupadi. Kām. ( XVII. 51-53 ) gives other examples of' māyā. Upekṣā consists in not preventing a person from doing what is unjust or being addicted to some vice or engaging in a fight and is illustrated by king Virāta's connivance at the death of Kicaka ( Kām. XVII. 55-57). Indrajāla means 'creat ing an illusion by means of incantations and other tricks' e. g. creating the illusion before the eyes of the enemy that a vast army is coming to attack them or showing that angels are descending to fight against them or making a shower of blood fall in the enemy's camp etc. (Kām. XVII. 58-59, Viseudharmottara II. 149 ). About the four well-known upayas, Manu (VII. 108-109 ) says that for the prosperity of one's kingdom sama and danda (punishment) are preferred, but if

the king's antagonists do not yield to him by the enployment of the first three then he may bring them round by daṇda (i. e. fighting and harassing them ) and that ( VII. 198, 200) danda is to be employed as the last resort, since victory is not certain, In the Sāntiparva 69. 23 the view of Bphaspati is quoted 228 that fighting should always be avoided (as far as possible) and that for securing one's purpose three upāyas ( other than fighting) are to be resorted to. Bṛhat-Parāśara X p. 280 also says that a wise man should not resort to fighting and that danda is to be resorted to only when there is no other course left. In Udyoga 132. 29-30 (cr. ed. chap. 130 ) Kunti sends a message through Krṣṇa to her son: *begging is forbidden to you nor is agriculture appropriate for you; you are a ksatriya living by the power of his arms and a protector against injury (kṣatāt trātā). Recover your ancestral share by sama, dāna, bheda, danda and naya': In Udyoga 150 (cr. ed. 148 ) Krspa informs Yudhisthira how he first employed sama, then bheda, then dāna ( viz. giving up the whole kingdom for five villages) and how only danda is the proper recourse in the case of the wicked Kauravas. Hopkins, as very often, being obsessed with his ideas of three strata in the Mahābhārata says that three means appear to be the oldest form and four means a later idea. There is hardly any warrant for this opinion as for many others in the same strain (J. A. O. S. vol. XIII. pp. 182-183 n). The Viṣnudharmottara II. 146 speaks of the four upāyas and states that danda as regards a foreign state is open (prakāśa ) i. e. burning and not-open ( aprakāśa i. e. by poison or secret death ). The Mit. on Yāj. I. 346 and Kām. XVIII. 1 say the same thing. The Viṣnudharmasūtra III. 38 prescribes that the four upāyas are to be employed at the proper time and according to the attitudes of the hostile king, friendly king, the madhyama and udāsīna kings 223. The Mit. on Yāj. I. 346 expressly states that the four upāyas are to be employed not only in the affairs between kings but also in the lives of all ordinary people and cites a verse wherein a father or teacher addresses a son or pupil making use of all four means 224 Kām.

(Vol. 

17–20 verses 972 ff (pp. 117-122), Nitivākyāmsta pp. 332-336 treat at length of these four upāyas. A few points only are noted here. Sāma is of five kinds viz. recounting the good turns done by each to the other; praising the qualities and actions of the persons to be won over; declaring the relationship of each other; representing the good that will result in future; declaring 'I am yours and I am at your service' ( Kām. XVII. 4-5). Dāna consists in returning what is deposited with one by another, consenting to the taking away by another of one's things, mak ing a gift of something new, giving what the other chooses to ask for, sending at fixed times what has to be given. Bheda ( sowing dissensions) consists in giving heavy bribes or presents to minis ters or feudatories, the crown prince and high officers of the enemy that are dissatisfied for various reasons, creating distrust between the king and his ministers, the rich men and the handsome men in the kingdom by the threat of the loss of life, honour, position, and wealth, by the fear of imprisoninent, by the fear that the king may carry away the beautiful wife of a subject or by suggesting that a handsome young man has his eye on the king's harem, and suggesting to a king that a kinsman desires to secure the kingdom to himself and thereby inducing the king to put out his eyes or cut off his limbs. This is effected by secret spies or persons who are in the pay of both kings ( ubhayavetana, acc. to Mānasollāsa p. 119 v.995 ) 225 Vide Kaut. XI. 1, Matsya chap. 223 and Sukra IV. 1. 25-54 for bheda, Kaut XI. I explains at length how an aspiring conqueror is to sow dissensions between corporations and the leaders of corporations, between chiefs and other people. One or two passages may be quoted by way of sample: "Spies gaining access to these corporations (of warriors and others ) and finding out jealousy, hatred and other causes of quarrel among them should sow seeds of a well-plan ned dissension among them, and tell one of them this man decries you'. Spies may give publicity to the consideration of priority shown to inferior persons in social intercourse in the face of the established custom of recognising the status of other persons by birth, bravery, and social position. In all these disputes the conqueror should help the inferior party with men and money and set them against the superior party. A woman who has disappointed her lover and has been for

given may approach and say to a chief' this chief is troubling me when my mind is set on you; when he is alive I cannot stay here' and thus induce the former to slay the latter.” The Matsyapurāṇa 223. 4 states that united people are more than a match even for Indra unless bheda is employed, that dissensions are of two kinds, internal and external, of which the former is more serious. External dissension means the quarrel with a chief, but internal dissension means dissension between a king and his queen or heir apparent or ministers. One should try to prevent dissension with one's own relatives. Santi 69. 23 also advises the conquest of territory by fomenting dissensions. There fore the expedient of divide et impera' has a respectable antiquity. Danda in the case of a king's country consists in sentencing to death or corporal punishment or fine and in the case of the eneiny in fighting, destroying or devastating his country by seiz ing his crops and grain, cattle, wealth, forts and in imprison ing and injuring his people, burning his villages and forests. 

There were certain privileges , that the king enjoyed. His rights to treasure trove have already been referred to (H. Dh. vol. II, p. 146). Kaut. (IV. 1) gives the following rules. The person giving information about the discovery of a mine, jewels or treasure trove gets one-sixth, but if the informer be a servant of the king he gets I's ; treasure trove beyond 100000 paṇas went to the king wholly ( the finder being entitled to a th share only up to 100000 paṇas of the whole ); a subject who can prove that the treasure trove belonged to his ancestors would get the whole of it; if he takes it without establishing his ancestral ownership he is to be fined 500 panas and 1000 paṇas if he appropriated it secretly. The king also took by escheat the property of a person dying without leaving any heir except in the case of brāhmaṇas (vide H. Dh. II, p. 146 where some authorities are cited). This subject will be dealt with at greater length under the next sect ion on law and justice'. The king was also entitled to all property that was lost or given up by the true owner. Vide Gaut. 226 X. 36-38, Vas. 16. 19, Manu VIII. 30-33, Yāj. II. 33, 173-174, Saṅkha-Likhita. Gaut. and Baud. Dh. S.(I. 10. 17 ) say that the king should preserve for one year articles found after proclaiming the finding by beat of drun, while Manu says that

the period is three years. The Mit. on Yāj. II. 33 reconciles these texts by saying that if the true owner comes to the king and establishes his ownership he gets back the entire article without paying anything for safe custody, if the owner comes in the 2nd year he pays it of the price for custody, if in the third year he pays to and if he comes after three years. The finder gets out of the share taken by the king. If the owner does not come at all the finder gets and the king the rest. The king may dispose of the article if none claims it within that period, but if the owner comes after three years and the article has been disposed off, the king should return the equivalent of the portior taken by him. Yāj. II. 174 specifies other scales of charges for the custody of unclaimed animals such as four panas for a horse &c. Another special privilege of the king was that he could not be cited as a witness in a judicial proceeding between private parties. Vide Kaut. III. 11 (p. 175), Manu VIII. 65, Viṣnudharma. sūtra 8. %. 

Constitutionally there was no one who could directly bring to book the king guilty of injustice. But the Dharmaśāstra writers insisted that dhar ma was the king of kings (Br. Up. I. 4. 14 quoted above p. 97 n. 125 ), that Varuna was the chastiser of kings (Manu IX. 245); therefore they appealed to the higher nature and conscience of the king and prescribed that if a king levied an unjust fine, he should offer thirty times of that amount to Varuna, throw the amount in water or distribute it among brāhmaṇas ( Yāj. II. 307) and that where an ordinary man would incur a fine of one kārsāpaṇa for a wrong, the king certainly deserves to be fined a thousand kārsāpanas (Manu VIII. 336 ). The remarks of Medhātithi on that verse quoted below are very interesting, when he insists on the principle that fines for the same wrong should vary with the capacity to pay 227. Even Kautilya (IV. 13 last two verses ) falls in line with Manu IX. 245 and Yaj. II. 307. But these prescriptions of Manu, Yāj. and Kaut, were counsels of perfection and must have been futile. No king would ordinarily fine himself. Therefore some medieval

digests like the Vivādaratnakara and the Dandaviveka (p. 55 ) interpret these texts as meaning that the word 'rājan' applies here only to subordinate chiefs and not to a king who is independent. 

The flourishing state of a kingdom well governed by a good, well-equipped and active king is very graphically describ ed in the Rāmāyaṇa ( II. 100. 43-46 ) ' I hope your country is full of hundreds of caityas (platforms for sacred trees) and of people who are well-placed; is rendered charming by temples, prapās (sheds where water is distributed to travellers gratis ) and tanks; in which men and women are joyful: which is set off to advan tage by merry gatherings and festivals; the whole extent of which is well cultivated; which is full of cattle and free from injury (to beings ); which does not depend upon rains alone (for its crops ); which is beautiful, free from beasts of prey and all kinds of dangers; which is endowed with mines; which is free from wicked men and enjoys prosperity and happiness'. The Adiparya chap. 109 (cr, ed. chap. 102 ) also contains a fine description of a well-governed and prosperous country. The country was to be full of public wells, gardens and meeting halls ( sabhā). The Visṇu-dharmottara I. 13. 2-1% contains an ideal description of ancient Ayodhyā. "It was endowed with hundreds of parks; it celebrated festivals and held gatherings of people; its population was free from disease and had valiant mon; it always resounded with the music of lutes, flutes and tabors; it had fair complexioned, charming hetarai clever in brilliant conversation; its population was always gay; it re sounded with the recitation of the Veda and was endowed with companies of brāhmaṇas ; its market rows were full of men that had applied scents to their bodies ; there was not a man there who was wretched, dirty or emaciated; it stretched for three yojanas on the bank of the Sarayū and was ten yojanas in the middle.'

CHAPTER VI DURGA ( FORT OR CAPITAL) 

Manu IX, 294 places the capital (pura) even before rastra. Medhatithi (on IX. 295 ) and Kullūka explain that the loss of the capital is a more serious danger than even the loss of some territory, because if the capital, which possesses all the stocks of food, in which are centred the principal elements and the army, is saved, then it is possible to retrieve even lost territory and to protect the country. It is as it were the pivot of the whole machinery of government. Other writers (and even Manu in VII. 69-70) place the capital or fort after the rastra. It is probably due to the geographical situation in North India and the nature of the fighting in ancient times that made the capi tal and forts of great importance in the several elements of the State. The capital mirrored the prosperity of the country and if properly walled also provided security. Yāj. I. 321 says that forts are meant for the safety of the king, the people and the treasury (janakośātmaguptaye). The reason for the construction of forts is well put by Manu VII. 74 viz. that a single archer under the shelter of the fort-wall can fight a hundred of the enemy and a hundred can fight ten thousand. The Pañcatantra (I. 229 and II. 14 ) has a similar verse. Bphaspati quoted by the Rājanītiprakāśa 288 p. 202 states that the king should con struct a fort with walls and a gate for the protection of himself, his wives, the people and the ( wealth ) collected by him. Kaut. (II. 3 and 4) deals at length with the construction of durgas and the laying out of the capital in one of them. He says that in the four quarters of the boundaries of the kingdom forts should be built for offering resistance (to the enemy) on ground naturally fitted for the purpose. He speaks of four kinds of forts viz. 'audaka' (water-protected, which is on an island burrounded by water or on a plain surrounded by low ground), pārvata (mountain one, such as a rocky hill or a cave ), dhūnvana (desert fort, on a waterless tract full of thickets or waste land ), a forest fort full of wagtails and water and

thickets of reed. He says that the first two are suited for the protection of populous places and the last two for the protection of foresters. Vayu 8. 108 • refers to four kinds of durgas. Manu VII. 70, Sānti 56. 35 and 86. 4-5, Viṣnudharmagūtra III. 6, Matsya 217. 6-7, Agnipurāṇa 222. 4-5, Viṣnudhar mottara II. 26. 6-9, III. 323. 16-21, Sukra IV. 6 speak of six kinds of forts viz. dhanvadurga ( which is waterless five yojanas round a raised plain), mahidurga (a land fort, which is surrounded by a wall built of stones or burnt bricks, that is at least twelve feet high and twice as high as it is broad), jaladurga ( water fort, surrounded on all sides by deep water), vārksa durga (fort that is surrounded for one yojana on all sides with thorny and tall trees and thorny creepers and bushes), nṛdurga (fort that is guarded by a numerous army of four sections on all sides ), giridurga (mountain fortress, difficult to climb and with only one narrow access). Manu VII. 71 says that the mountain fortress is the best of all, while śānti 56. 35 states that nrdurga is the most difficult to conquer. The Mānasollāsa (II. 5 p. 78) speaks of nine kinds of durgas (adding those built with stones, bricks and mud). The Parasurama- pratāpa enumerates eight kinds of durgas (Rāja vallabhakānda, folio 1) and states that the wall of a fort may be of stones or of baked bricks or of mud. Manu VII. 75 Sabhā 5. 36 ( =Ayodhyā 100, 53), Matsya 217. 8, Kām. IV, 60, Mānasollasa III. 5 (verses 550-555), Sukra IV, 6. 12-13, Vigpu' dharmottara II. 26. 20-88 prescribe that forts should possess plenty of arms, grain, drugs and other materials, wealth, horses, elephants, beasts of burden, brahmaṇas, artisans, machines (called Sataghnis acc. to Matsya, that kill a hundred), water and fodder. The Nitivākyāmṛta ( durga-samuddesa p. 199) says that there must be means of leaving it secretly, otherwise it will be a prison and that no one should be allowed to enter it or leave it without a pass or without being searched. Kaut. ( II. 3) gives detailed instructions for the construction of fort walls, towers, ditches, pillars, lotus ponds and buildings inside the fort, which are all passed over for want of space. Vide the Rājadharmakānda pp. 28-36 and the Rājadharmakaustubha pp. 115-117 for numerous quotations from the Dhanurveda of Uganas, the Mahābhārata, the Matsya, the Visnudharmottara and other works on durya.

[ Vol. 

and in II. 20.8 it is narrated that Indra killed the dasyus and destroyed their cities of ayas (copper, huvi dasyūn pura āyasir ni tārit ). This shows that walled cities were known even at that distant date. There is difference of opinion as to whether the walls were of mud and wood or of stones and bricks. Vide Hopkins in J. A. O. S. XIII. pp. 174-176. The Tai. S. VI. 2. 3. 1 speaks of the three cities of asuras constructed with ayas, silver and gold (hariṇi). In the agni cayana as described in the Sat. Br. thousands of baked bricks were required. The excavations at Mohenjo-daro show that walls were built of burnt bricks ( Marshall, vol. I. pp. 15–26 ), There is no reason to assume that houses, palaces and city walls could not have been built of bricks, simply because no purely Hindu ruins anterior to Alexander have yet been discovered or because Megasthenes describes that Pataliputra had a wall of wooden palisades. One must demur to the remarks of Hopkins on pp. 174-175 of J. A. O. S. vol. XIII. Walls ( prākāra ), toranas (arched gates) and upper stories (attālakas), moats are very often spoken of in connection with capitals in both epics. The gates were sometimes called after cities e. g. in Vanaparva I. 9-10 the Pandavas are said to have gone out of Hastinapura from the gate called Vardhamanapura.229 Vide also Asramavāsi. parva 16. 3. The Mahābhārata states that palaces had dancing halls (nartanāgāra ) attached to them ( Virāṭa-parva 22. 16 and 25-26). Sānti 69.60 states that the capital was rendered gay by natas (players ) and dancers and Sānti 86 ( 4-15) describes how cities were to be founded in durgas, how they were to be full of music, festivals and merry gatherings (samājot sava) and what stores they should contain. In the Rāmāyaṇa (V.2.50-53 ) Lankā is described as having palaces of seven or eight stories and mosaic pavements. The Bșhatsamhitā (chap. 53) contains in 125 verses very accurate directions and measure ments about palaces, houses &c. (i. e. on vāstuśāstra ). It states that the best kind of royal palace was to be 108 cubits broad, that palaces of 100, 92, 84, 76 cubits may be built, that the length in each case was to be one-fourth as much more as the breadth. It speaks of the dimensions of mansions for the commander-in-chief, ministers, the queen, crown prince, purohita, physician &c. In v. 23 it states that the walls may be of baked bricks or of wood.

The Capital 

181 

The king was to have his capital inside a fort or in dependent of it. Manu VII. 70, 76, Aśramavāsi 5. 16-17, Sānti 86.6-10, Kām. IV. 57, Matsya 217. 9ff, Sukra I. 213-217 describe where and how a capital was to be built. Kautilya ( in II. 4) describes at great length how the capital was to be laid out viz. the extent should be demarcated by three royal roads from west to east and three from south to north, the capital should have twelve gates, provided with concealed land and water exits : the chariot roads, the royal roads and roads loading to drona-mukha, sthāniya, the rāstra and pastures should be four daṇdas ( 16 cubits) in width. He then prescribes the width of roads for various other purposes. Occupying one-ninth of the whole area of the capital, but to the north from the centre of the capital and in the midst of people of all castes the king's own palace should be built facing the east or north. To the north-east of the palace should be the residences of the king's teacher (ācārya ), purohita, ministers and the sacrificial place and water reservoir. He then assigns appropriate places round about the palace for the offices of the several superintendents, to merchants, principal artisans, brāhmaṇas, kṣatriyas, vaisyas, prostitutes, wool workers, śūdras &c. In the centre of the capital were to be constructed apartments for the images of Aparajita, Apratihata, Jayanta and Vaijayanta and the temples of Siya, Kubera, the Aśvins, Lakṣmi and Madira (Durgā?). The principal gates named after Brahmā, Yama, Indra and Kārtikeya were to be constructed. At a distance of 100 bows (400 cubits) beyond the ditch, platforms for holy trees, groves and embankments should be built. The cemetery should be to the east or north but to the south for the higher varnas. Heretics and cāndālas should have a place of residence beyond the cemetery. For each group of ten families there must be a well; oil, grain, sugar, salt, medicines, dried vegetables, fire-wood, arms, and other essential commodities should be stored in such large quantities that they might last for several years in case of a siege or invasion. The Matsyapurana ( 217. 9-87) differs from the above description in many ways. It prescribes four wide roads, at the ends of which a temple, the royal palace, the court of justice and the principal gate are to be respectively constructed. Almost the whole of the description in the Matsya is quoted by the Rajanitiprakāśa (pp. 208-213) and also in the Rājadharmakanda pp. 28-36. The former also quotes (pp. 214-219) a long passage from the Devipurāpa with regard to the construction of a nagara,182

Pāṇini ( VII. 3. 14 prācām grāmanagarāṇām) distinguishes between grāma and nagara, while Patañjali thereon (vol. III. p. 321 ) explains that grāma, ghosa, nagara, and samvāha are the appellations of different groups or settlements of people. The Vāyupurāṇa ( 94. 40 ) separately mentions cities (purani) ghoṣas (hamlets of cowherds ), villages and pattanas. Vide Sukranitisāra I. 213-258 for provisions about the laying out of the capital, the palace, the court of justice, other state offices and public buildings, ditches &c. and Yuktikalpataru pp. 22 ff, Vāyu 8. 108 ff, Matsya 130. Sukra (I. 260-267) describes how four royal roads should start from the palace in four direc tions, how the best, middling and inferior royal roads should be 30, 20 and 15 cubits in breadth; he defines jxidyā (a foot-path), vithi (a lane ) and mārga as respectively equal tn 3, 5 and 10 cubits in breadth, that in the capital there should be no narrow street like a padyā or vithi, that even in villages the public road should be at least 10 cubits in width, that all roads should slope down from their middle and that all houses should face the royal road. For a description of Ayodhyā vide Rāmāyapa II. 100. 40-42, which says that it was full of valiant men, had strong gates, was full of elephants, horses, and chariots, was inhabited by energetic people of all castes that were devoted to their duties, that had mansions of various sizes, that it was prosperous and had many physicians. From the Rāmāyana (VI. 112. 42 siktarathyūn tarāpana ) and the Mahābhārata ( Adi. 221. 36) it appears that the roads of the capital were watered. In the Harṣacarita (III) Bāna gives a graphic description of Sthānvisvara ( inodern Thanesar ). For the local administration of the capital, vide the duties of the nagaraka described above (p. 149 ) from Kautilya (II. 36 ). From the Paharpur plates ( dated Gupta samvat 159 i. e. 478-9 A D.) it appears that a nagara-śreṣthin (the chief of the bankers and traders of the capital) was nominated (probably by the king ). Vide E. I. vol. 20 p. 59 at p. 61. There was probably a board of the elders of the city (pauramukhyas or pauravrddhas

In the Damodarpur copper plates also a nagaraśreṣthin is mentioned along with others who were approached for consenting to a purchase of land (E. I. vol. XV at pp. 130, 133, dated Gupta saivat 129). Megasthenes ( in McCrindle's Ancient India ', Fragment XXXIV p. 187) describes the city of Palibothra ( Pataliputra ) and its administration. He says that six committees of five each looked to the affairs of the city and were respectively in charge of (1) industrial arts, ( 2 ) entertainment and care of foreigners, (3) inquiries about births and deaths, ( 4 ) trade and commerce, weights and measures, (5) manufactured articles, ( 6 ) collection of the 10th of the prices of articles sold. Fragments XXV-XXVI (pp. 65-67) inform us that Palibothra was 80 stadiu in length and 15 in width, that in shape it was a parallelogram, that it was surround ed by a wooden wall with holes for discharging arrows and a ditch in front. Arrian states (pp. 209-210 of McCrindle's 'Ancient India') that Palibothra had 570 towers and 64 gates. Patanjali in his Mahābhāsya frequently brings in Pātaliputra (e. g. in vol. I p. 380 he states that Pātaliputra is alongside of the river Sona, on Pān. II. 1. 16 ), in vol. II. p. 311 ( vārtika 4 on Pān. IV. 3, 66 ) he refers to its walls and to its palaces, in vol. II. p. 321 ( on Pāṇ. IV. 3. 134 ). In Ha-Hien's time (399-414 A. D.) the royal palace and halls in the midst of the city built of stone still existed and were so grand that they were then believed to have been the work of spirits ( vide Legge p. 77). Vide Rhys Davids' 'Buddhist India' pp. 34-41 for the ancient Indian capitals in the 7th century BC. 

In the Bhagavatapurāṇa (IV. 18. 30-32 ) it is narrated that Pṛthu, son of Vona, first levelled the earth, established human habitations in villages, towns, capitals, forts &c., and that before Pșthu people resided where they liked and there were no such groups as villages or towns. Bhrgu quoted by Sridhara accord ing to Rājaniti-kaustubha defines grāma as the habitation of brāhmaṇas, their hired labourers and sūdras, that kharvata is on the bank of a river and of a mixed character, one side being a village and the other a town. Saunaka quoted by the Rājansti-kaustubha ( pp. 103-4) defines kheta as a place where brahmanan, ksatriyas and vaisyas reside, that a place where all castes reside is called a town, that brāhmaṇa householders should be established on soil that is whitish and has sweet odour, kṣatriyas should be established in towns where the soil is reddish and wafts & sweet odour and vaiśyas on yellowish soil.

CHAPTER VII 

KOSA (TREASURY OR FINANCE) 

Kaut (II. 1) states that a king whose treasury is depleted preys upon the citizens and the rural population and (II. 8) very 231 rightly remarks that all undertakings depend upon kośa (financial position of the king), therefore the king must pay the first attention to kośa. Gautama (as cited by 8. V. p. 46 ) holds that kośa is the basis or support of the other six elements of the State. The Sāntiparva 119. 16 calls upon the king to guard his finances with great effort, since kings depend upon kośa, which tends to the prosperity ( of the kingdom). Kām. XIII. 33 states that it is on the lips of all that the king is dependent on koga. Sānti 133 contains a eulogy of kośa. The Viṣnudharmottara II. 61, 17 says that kośa is the root of the tree of State. The two great pillars of the Indian States in ancient India were the revenue and the army. Manu VII. 65 says that kośa and the government of the realm depend on the king i. e. they should be the personal concern of the king. Yāj. (I. 327-328) recommends that the king should personally look into the income and expenditure every day and keep in his treasury buildings whatever is brought by those who are appointed to bring gold and wealth. Kām. V.77 and Sukra I. 276-278 say the same. The Rājataran gini (VII. 507-508) tells us that king Kalasa of Kashmir (1063–1089 A. D.) kept accounts like a merchant, closely watched income and expenditure and had a clerk by his side with chalk and bhūrja ( birch leaf) to write upon. The principal means of filling the treasury is taxation. It is therefore neces sary to consider first the principles of taxation as evolved by our writers. The first principle was that the king could not levy, according to the smrtis, taxes at his pleasure or sweet will, that the rates of taxes which the king was entitled to lovy were fixed by the smrtis and varied only according to the

Principles of taxation

commodity and also according as the times were normal or there was danger of invasion or some other calamity impending. For example, Gaut. X. 24, Manu VII. 130, Viṣnu Dh. S. III. 22-23 declare that the king may ordinarily take a sixth part of the grain-crops or produce of the soil, but Kaut. (V. 2), Manu (X. 118 ), Santi 87, Sukra IV. 2. 9-10 permit the king to take even one-third or one-fourth part of the crops in times of dis tress (āpad). It has however to be noted that Kautilya requires the king to beg (yāceta ) of the people for this heavy taxation, he employs the word pranaya ( request) for such demands, such taxation was not to be levied from inferior lands, and he expressly says that such a demand for excessive taxation is to be made only once and not twice in the same distress. 282 Santi ( 87. 26-33 ) contains a specimen of a long address to be given to the people when a king demands higher taxation in danger (such as 'if the enemy invades you, you will lose all including even your wives, the enemy will not restore to you what he robs you of' &c.). The word 'pranaya' occurs in this sense in the Junagadh Inscription of Rudradāman (E. I. vol. VIII. p. 36 ll. 15-16). Another principle laid down in somewhat poetical and picturesque language is that taxation should be felt by those taxed as light and not heavy or excessive. The Udyogaparva 233 ( 34. 17-18 ) states ' just as a bee draws honey but at the same time leaves the flowers uninjured, so the king should take wealth from men without harming them. One (a bee ) may search each flower (for honey) but should not cut the very root just like a garland-maker, but not like a coal maker'. Manu (VII. 129 and 140 ) laconically puts the matter thus just as the leech, the calf and the bee take their sustenance little by little, so must the king draw from his kingdom annual taxes little by little. Let the king not cut up his own root (by levying no taxes ) nor the root of others by 234 excessive greed'. Śānti (88

4-6 ) states that the king should draw (taxes ) from the realm lightly in the way the bee draws honey from the trees, he should do so in the way of the calf and should not bruise the udders (as the calf does not ). Those verses also refer to the action of the leech, of the tigress carrying her cuba between her jaws and the rat gnawing at the feet of sleeping men. These ideas pervaded society so much that the same figure of the bee is instanced as regards the Buddhist bhikkhu's importu nity for alms in the Dhammapada (verse 49). The king should act like a gardener who prepares garlands without harming the trees and their leaves and should not act like one who prepares coals from trees (Santi 71,20) 235. Manu VII. 139 requires that the king should not through greed tax the subjects heavily, as he would thereby cut off the roots (i. e. prosperity and content ment) of the people, nor should he cut off his own roots (i. e. reduce himself to bankruptcy) by levying no taxes. A third principle of taxation was that when increasing taxes the rise should be gradual and a little at a time ( Santi 88. 7-8). Taxes were to be recovered at a proper time and proper place (Santi 88. 12 and Kam. V. 83-84)226. When taxing traders the king should make allowance for the price they had to pay, for the chances of selling the commodity (in his kingdom ), the dis tance over which the merchandise was brought, what they must have spent for their food and condiments and the cost of guard

With the above principles of taxation one may compare Adam Smitb's famous canons: (1) the subjects of every state ought to contribute towards the support of the Government as nearly as possible in proportion to their respective abilities i. e, in proportion to the revenue which they respectively enjoy under the protection of the State. (2) The tax which each individual is bound to pay ought to be certain and not arbitrary. The time of payment, the manner of payment, the quantity to be paid ought to be clear and plain to the contributor and to every other person. (3) Every tax ought to be levied at the time or in the manner in which it is nost likely to be convenient for the contributor to pay it, (4) Every tax ought to be so contrived as both to take out and keep out of the pockets of the people as little as possible over and above what it brings into the public treasury (vide. Wealth of nations' ed. by Rogers, 1869, vol: II. pp. 414-416.)

ing the merchandise (Manu VII. 127=Santi 8713-14)237 In the case of artisans, before taxing them, the king has to pay regard to the labour and skill involved and to the necessaries of life required by them (Santi 87, 15). Every one, however poor, must contribute something to the finances of the realm. Manu (VII. 137-138) says that even a very poor man who maintains himself by following some occupation should be asked to contribute every year something in the nature of kara ( a tax), while workers (like cooks ), artisans (like blacksmiths ), śūdras who subsist by manual labour (like porters ) should be asked to contribute one day's work to the king in a month. Vide Gaut. X. 31-34, Visnu Dh. Ś. III. 32 for the same. But Sukra IV.2. 121 says that workers and artisans should do one day's work for the king gratis in a fortnight. Gaut. X. 34 adds that the king must supply them with food on the day they work gratis. The importance of a gold and silver reserve was well understood. Kām. (IV. 62-64) says 238 that the king's kosa should have many sources for filling it, but few outlets of expenditure, it should be full of all desired kinds of wealth, guarded by trusty officers, rich in pearls, gold and jewels, it should have been acquired according to sāstric rules, be capable of bearing great strain of expenditure and that kośn is to be preserved only for the purpose of securing the two goals viz. dlarm and artha, for affording maintenance to the servants engaged by the king and as a safeguard against calamities. Sukra IV. 2-3 remarks that kośa is accumulated for the upkeep of the army and for the benefit of the people and for performing sacrifices. Gaut. X. 28-29, Manu VII. 128, VIII. 306-308, Nār. (prakirnaka 48 ) and others say, als has beon already stated, that taxation is meant for the protection of the subjects and that it is the king's wages ( petan) for the protection he affords. Manu IX. 305 compares the king taking taxes to the sun that produces vapour from the seas (in order to return it in the form of rain, as the Raghu vamsa I. 18 very happily puts it). Kām. (V. 78-79) enumerates eight principal sources (called aṣtenarija) of filling the treasury

through the action of the heads of the departments viz. agricul ture, trade-routes (both on land and water ), the capital, water embankments, catching of elephants, working mines and collect ing gold &c., levying wealth (from the rich ), founding towns and villages in uninhabited spots. The Mānasollasa (II. 4 verses 539-540 p. 77) advises the king to spend ordinarily three-fourths of the yearly revenues and save one-fourth. Sukra (I. 315-317 ) prescribes that the king should save 1/6 of his total annual income and should spend 1/2 of the whole on the army and one-twelfth each on charity (to the learned, the poor and helpless &c.), ministers, inferior officials, and his private purse or expenses. Sukra IV. 2. 26 requires the king to have as much stock of grain as would be required for three years' consumption in his country. In IV. 2. 13 he sets before the king the impossi ble ideal that his treasury should be so full that he can support his army for 20 years if no taxes from agriculture or tolls were raised or no fines were recovered. The Mānasollāsa (II. 4. 394, 397 p. 64 ) says that the king's treasury should be always full of gold, silver, jewels, ornaments and costly clothes, that pure gold in the form of niṣkas (coins ) or bars or ornaments should be held in the treasury. Kaut. (IV. 3) as stated above permitted the king in famines to make the rich disgorge their wealth, In V.2 he remarks that if after making special requests for additional taxation, when the treasury is empty and some danger is impending, to the cultivators, merchants, wine-sellers, prostitutes and those who rear pigs, poultry, cattle &c., the king may request the rich to give as much of their gold as they can and the king may honour them by bestowing on them a post at his court, or the dignity of an umbrella, a turban or some decoration in return for their wealth239. He permits the king in calamities to take away the wealth of the corporations (sanghas) of heretics and of temples also, to set up all of a sudden on one night a god or a platform ( caitya) for a holy tree or a sacred place for a man of miraculous powers and provide for fairs and merry gatherings there and secure the necessary money.

240. Compare note 164 above about the Mauryas who wanting money set up images, according to Patañjali. The Rājatarangiṇi (V. 166-177) describes the exactions of king Saṅkara-varman of Kashmir (883-902) A. D. He plunder. ed 64 temples under the pretext of supervision. He imposed taxes on grhaksiya (1. e. on upanayana, marriages &c.). In tbe 11th century king Harna of Kashmir plundered most of the temples (Rājatarangini VII, 1090).

recommends many other tricks and dodges for securing money, which ere passed over. Perhaps the only redeeming feature of these devices is that Kautilya is careful to point out that they were to be employed only against the seditious and the irreligi ous and not against others (V.2 'evum dūśyesvadhārmikeșu varteta netareṣu'). Vide Nitivākyāmsta (kosa-saniuddesa) p. 205 for similar provisions to replenish a depleted treasury. The Paraśurāmapratāpa (Rājavallabhakānda, folio 27b) quotes a verse which recommends resort to alchemy for replenishing the treasuryesla. Sukra IV.2. 11 advises the king when in financial difficulties to promise interest to the rich and take their wealth and to return it with interest when the difficulties are got over$41. Sānti ( 88. 29-30) asks4% the king to honour the wealthy men in his kingdom, since they constitute an important element of the realm and are the most eminent among all beings and to request them 'confer along with me favours on the people'. 

Several reasons are assigned for people's payment of taxes to the king. Gaut. X. 28 says that they should do so because he protects them. In some places the idea put forward is that taxes are the wages (vetana ) of the king and that the subjects made a contract with the king Manu to that effect. Vide santi 67 and 70.10, Baud. Dh. S. I. 10. 1, Nār. 18. 48, Kaut. I. 13 (quoted on p. 21 above). Kāt. 243 (verses 16-17) states that as the king is the owner of the earth but not of other kinds of wealth, he is entitled to get the sixth part of the produce of land and that since human beings reside on land they are declared to be owners (in ordinary parlance, but they have only a qualified ownership). Several kinds of taxes are mentioned in the dharmaśāstras, arthaśāstras and the inscriptions. The oldest

word for a tax paid to the king is' bali'. Rg. VII. 6. 5844 and X. 173. 6 speak of the common people as 'ballhrt' (bringers of bali, tribute or tax for the king). In the Tai. Br. (II. 7. 18. 3 ) it is said the people bring ball to him'. In the Ait. Br. (35.3 ) the raibya is characterized as 'balikrt' (payer of taxes tu another), since brahmanas and kṣatriyas were mostly exempt from taxat ion. Vide Prof. Hopkins' Social condition of the ruling class' J. A.O. 8. vol. XIII. p. 89 and Fick p. 119 (as to the evidence of the Jātakas on taxation). Manu VII. 80, Matsya 215. 57, Rāmāyana III. 6. 11, Visnu Dh, S. III. 22 employ the word "bali' in the sense of the 6th part of the produce of land that the king levied as tax. In the Rummindei Pillar Inscription of Asoka (Corpus I. I. vol. I. p. 164 ) it is said that the village of Lummini was made free from the payment of 'bali', but had to pay one-eighth share. 148 Here 'bali' is contrasted with 'bhāga' which is a general term. The word 'kara' appears to mean a tax in general. Vide Ap. Dh. S, II. 10. 26. 10, Manu VII. 128, 129, 133, Vas. 19. 23, Viṣnu Dh. S. III. 26-27. The word 'bhāga' (share) is also general and means the king's dues on land, trees, drugs, cattle, wealth &c. Vide Manu VII. 130-131, VIII. 305, Vispu Dh. S. III. 25. This meaning of 

· bhāga 'is ancient. We saw above (p. 112 ) that bhāgadugha is one of the ratnins of the king. The Amarakosa treats buli, kara, and bhāgn as synonymous. 

The word 'sulka' generally means the tolls or customs duties levied from vendors and purchasers on merchandise carried into or out of the kingdom (Sukranītisāra IV. 2. 108). The Mahābhāsya on the vārtika āyasthanebhyasthak' on Pān. IV. 2. 104.gives saulkika and gaulmika as examples, indicating thereby that sulka or toll was levied as a source of income (āya) at the toll-gate. 

The principal and perennial sources of income to the state were three viz. the king's share of the produce of land, tolls and customs duties, fines levied from wrongdoers or defeated litigants (vide Santi 71.10 and Sukra IV. 2. 13). From this and from Manu X. 119-120 it appears that the principal tax-payers

were agriculturists, traders, manual workers and artisans. In Manu VIII. 307 quoted in the Dandaviveka of Vardhamāna (p. 5) it is said that the king who, without affording protection, levies buli, kara, śruku, pratibhogu (pratibhāga in the printed smrti ) and cança (fines) goes at once to hell and Vardhamāna explains kuru as the dues recovered every month from villagers and city-dwellers ( every month or twice a year in Bhadrapada or Pausa according to Kullūka ), sulka as the twelfth share re cuvered from traders, pratibhuga as the dues in the form of fruits, flowers and vegetables presented every day. A few remarks on these and other taxes inust be made here. Manu VII. 130, Gant. X. 24, Viṣnu Dh. S. III. 22, Mānasollāsa ( 11. 3. 163 p. 44 ) and several others prescribe that the king is entitled to the 6th, 8th or 12th part ( only sixth in Viṣnu, also 10th in Gaut.) of the yield of grain from land. Bphaspati and the Visnudharmot tara + ( II. 61. 60-61 ) quoted in the Rājanitiprakāśa (pp. 262 263) make it clear under what circumstances these different shares are to be taken: viz. the king, takes 16 of $ūkudhanya (awned or bearded grain like wheat and barley ), 1/8 from simbidhānya (grain in pods), 10th part from crops grown on land that was fallow for many years, 1/8th from lands sownin the rainy season and one-sixth from land: that have spring crops. The tax was to be paid once every year or once in six months according to the custom of the country. The varying rates prescribed by Kautilya have been indicated in describing the duties of the sitādhyaksa. Sukra (IV. 2. 121-122 ) gives a salutary rule that if a cultivator constructs a tank, a well or an artificial water-course or brings under cultivation land previously fallow, the king should not levy a tax thereon till the person making the expenditure has recovered twice the amount spent by him. Kaut. (II. 1 ) provides that the king may show favour (thugrulu ) to the cultivators by supplying them with seed, cattle and money and that they should return the advances by easy instalments and that the king shall bestow favours and romissions (parihūra) in such a way that they might tend to swell the treasury and not tend to its

depletion. 27 It has already been stated that according to the smrtis the ordinary share of the king was one-sixth, but that in case of the danger of invasion or similar calamity he was allow ed to raise it to one-fourth. Megasthenes (Fragment I, p. 42 ) says that no person is permitted to own land and that besides the land tribute people pay into the royal treasury a fourth part of the produce. This shows that the tax on land was very heavy in the times of Candragupta probably owing to his wars to drive away the Greeks and the huge armies that he had to employ. Manu VII. 130, Gaut. X. 25, Visṇu Dh. S. III. 24, Mānasollāsa ( II. 3. 163 p. 44 ) hold that the king is entitled to the 50th part of the cattle reared by herdsmen and of the interest earned by those who lend money at interest. This last appears to be analogous to modern income-tax. The Sukranitisāra IV. 2. 128 makes the tax to be 's on the interest earned by money-lending, 248 Visnu adds cloth to these two. Manu VII. 131-132, Gaut. X. 27, Visnu Dh. S. III. 25, Viṣnudharmottara II. 61. 61-63 and Mānasollāsa lay down that the king is entitled to a sixth part of trees, meat, honey, clarified butter, perfumes (like sandal-wood ), medicinal plants (like gudūci), rasa ( salt &c.), flowers, roots (like turmeric), fruits, leaves ( like palm leaves), vegetables, grass, hides, articles manufactured from bamboo slips, earthenware, articles prepared from stones. Viṣnu adds deer hides to these. 

· Sulka is of two kinds, what is levied on goods carried by land and what is levied on goods carried by water (Mit. on Yāj. II. 263). Gaut. X. 26 and Viṣnu Dh. S. III. 29 state that the sulka is 1/20th part on merchandise for sale ( bought and sold in the country itself) which is interpreted by some (like Haradatta and Nandapandita ) as meaning that 5 per cent of the price of articles sold should be taken by the king as tax, while the Rājanitiprakaśa (p. 264 ) explains that the king is entitled only to five per cent of the difference between the cost price and the sale price of merchandise. Manu VIII. 398 also is susceptible of these two interpretations, as the commentaries of Medbātithi and Kullūka show. The Viṣnu Dh. S. (III. 29-30) prescribes that the king takes one-tenth on merchandise produced in his own country and one-twentieth on goods imported from a foreign

country. Yāj. II. 261 says that the sulka on goods is twentieth part of the prices of the goods. Kaut. (II. 21 ) in his chapter on the superintendent of tolls ( sulkādhyaksa ) sets out several rules, of which a few interesting ones are given here. Com modities intended for marriage or taken by a bride from her parents to her husband or meant as presents or for the purpose of sacrifices or the accouchement of women or for the worship of gods, or for the ceremonies of caula, upanayana, godūna, or for the observance of a vrata or for the consecration of a person for a sacrifice and for other special ceremonies shall be allowed to go free of tolls. Whatever commodities would cause harm to the realm or are useless should be destroyed; whatever is of great benefit and seeds not easily available should be allowed to be imported without charge 249 He further says (II. 22 ) that sulka is levied on exports and imports of merchandise and that on imports the tax will be one-fifth of the price of the commodities ( as a general rule ) and prescribes varying rates (1/6, 1/10, 1/15, 1/20, 1/25 ) on different kinds of articles. In II. 28 (on the superintendent of shipping ) Kautilya gives further rules some of which have been already noted. He prescribes rules for ferries also, viz. that brāhmanas, ascetics, children, very old people, sick men, messengers, pregnant women are to be provided with free passes by the superintendent enabling them to use the ferries. A man with a load and small animals were to pay one māsa at a ferry, a cow or a horse two māsas and so on. The Mānasollāsa (II. 4. vy. 374-376 p. 62 ) prescribes that the king should well guard all harbours (velā-pura) that are near the sea, that when the boats of sailors residing in his own country return to the harbour the king should charge one-tenth (of the price of goods brought ) as the duty and that when foreign boats are driven to his harbour by an unfavourable wind, the king should confiscate all their merchandise or may give a little to the owners of those boats. In this connection a very interesting inscription may be referred to. The Motupalli pillar Inscription 850 of the Kakatiya king Ganapatideva (of

( Vol 

1244-45 A. D.) issues (E. I. vol. XII p. 195) a charter of security ( abhaya-śāsana) to the sailors who ply between towns in dif ferent countries, islands and continents : 'when ships that made voyages from one country to another were driven or were shattered or touched at a place that was not meant as a place of call, owing to unfavourable winds, former kings forcibly took away all commodities therein such as gold, elephants, horses &c.; but we, considering that wealth is dearer than life itself, have with kindness decided to give everything except the fixed Sulka to those sailors who undertake the great venture of cross ing the sea, so that thereby we shall secure fame and righteous ness; the sulka fixed is as follows'. About sulka to be levied on goods brought by the sea the Baud. Dh. S. (1. 10.15-16) prescribes that it is 10 per cent of the cargo except one best article (which is totally exempted). In the Kharepatan grant of the Silāra king Rattarāja dated sake 930 it is provided that one golden gadiyūna was levied as duty on each vessel that came froni another country (dvipāntarāyāta-vahitrāt) and one golden dharana had to be paid on each vessel coming from the district of Kandalamūliya excepting Cemulya (modern Cheul) and Candrapura. Vide E. I. vol. III. p. 292 at p. 301. Sukra (IV. 2. 109-111) lays down some very reasonable rules viz. on the same commodity sulka is to be taken in the same country by the king only once and never more than once; the king may take either 1/16, 1/20 or 1/32 from the vendee or vendor; no śulka is to be taken from the vendor when he has to sell his goods at the same price at which he bought them or for less than the cost price; the king should always take from the buyer the proper gulka after seeing what profit he is going to make. Nār, (sambhūya-samutthāna verses 14-15 ) lays down that whatever is to be used by śrotriyas ( brāhmaṇas learned in the Vedas ) for domestic purposes is exempt, but not what they may employ in trade; the gifts received by brāhmaṇas, the property of stage players, whatever is carried on a man's shoulderson all these no śulka must be levied. The exemption of brāhmaṇas and others from taxation has already been dealt with in H. Dh. vol. II. pp. 143-145. Gaut. X. 9-12, Ap. Dh. S. II. 10. 26. 10-16, Vas. I. 42-46 and 19. 23-24, Manu. VIII. 394 exempt a learned brahmana, the women of all varpas, all boys before the signs of puberty appear, all those who stay with a teacher for study, ascetics who are intent on dharma, sūdras that do menial work such as washing the feet of higher varnas, the blind, the deaf and dumb, the diseased, the cripple, an old man of 70 years or

more. Though these really required more protection than most people, humanity and higher feelings made them exempt from taxes from very ancient times. The claims to exemption were probably exaggerated and not respected in practice. For example, Nārada (VI. 14 ) states that the king is not to levy tolls or customs duties on articles required by śrotriyas for domestic use but if they engaged in trade they had to pay taxes on merchandise.251 The Mit. on Yāj. II. 4 states that the six exemp tions mentioned in Gaut. (VIII. 12-13) apply only to a very learned brāhmaṇa and not to all brāhmaṇas. Manu. VII. 133 provides that a king even when he has lost everything should not levy a tax on śrotriyas and relying on this the Vaijayanti explains Visnu Dh. S. III. 26 as referring only to learned brāhmanas. The Rāmāyana (III. 6. 14)25 la states, differing from other authorities, that the king shares one-fourth of the merit of munis ( ascetics ) dwelling in his kingdom. There was a corresponding liability on the king ; viz. he shared half and half in the demerit due to the sins committed by the subjects that are not properly restrained by him (Yaj. I. 337). Manu and Viṣnu. Dh. S. III. 28 and Viṣnudharmottara II. 61. 25 say that he reaps the sixth part of the sin of his subjects. 

Kaut, in II. 15 mentions numerous kinds of taxes or dues that were levied by the king. It is not possible to explain many of the terms used by him. In the ancient inscriptions, when making grants of a village and the like, it is usual for the kings to specify the exemptions from taxes and dues that went with the grant. Such exemptions were called parihūra, which word occurs in Kautilya and also in the Hāthigumpha Inscription of Khāravela ( in the 2nd century B.C., E. I. vol. xx at p. 9) where we read 'bamhanānam jātim parihāram dadāti'. In certain 

early records even, these exemptions are said to be eighteen, e. 8. in the Hirahadagalli plate of Sivaskandavarman ( E. I. vol. I. p. 6 ) and 258 the Omgudu plate of Vijayaskandavarman

Fines as a source of revenue will be discussed in the next section about 'law and justice'. The king had numerous other sources of income. Kaut (II. 12 ) describes the duties of the superintendent of mines. Every thing dug up from mines belonged to the king ( Vispudharmasūtra III. 55). According to Manu VIII. 39 and Medhātithi thereon the king is entitled to a half (or some share , &c.) of the ore dug out of mines, as he is the lord of the earth and gives protection. In modern times under sec. 69 of the Bombay Land Revenue Code, Government have a right to all mines and minerals. The Parasuramapratāpa \#sta quotes a verse : 'Brahmā arranged that the king was ( to be ) the owner of all wealth and specially (wealth) that is inside the earth, while Kāt. (16-17) says ( vide note 243 ) 'the king is declared to be the lord of the land, but never of other kinds of wealth ; therefore he should secure the sixth part of the fruits of land, but not otherwise at all. Since human beings reside on it (land) their ( qualified ) ownership thereof has been declared'. For further discussion of the theory of the king's ownership of all land, vide H. of Dh. vol. II. pp. 865-869. The State itself manufactured salt, took its share in salt manufactured by private persons and levied as State dues on imported salt.

(evamādikehi atthārasajātiparihūrehi). Vide Vilavatti grant of Pallava king Simbavarman for a long enumeration of taxes collected from villages in South India in E.

Mānadollāba ( II. 3. verses 332 and 361 ) asks the king to guard mines of gems, gold and silver and declares that the Creator made the king the ruler over all wealth and especially over what is inside the earth. Rudradāman (150 A. D.) boasts that he filled his treasury by means of bali, sulka and bhāga levied according to the sāstras and that his treasury overflowed with heaps of gold, silver, diamonds, lapis lazuli and other gems ( E. I. vol. VIII. p. 36 at p. 44). Kaut (IV.1) says that those who sweep the dust ( near mines &c.) should get one-third of the valuable things found and the king should get two-thirds and all jewels. The king had also monopolies in certain matters. He alone could catch elephants. Kaut (II. 31-32 ) and Mānasollāsa (II. 3, pp. 44-58) deal with this matter, the latter describing several methods of catching elephants. Medhātithias3 on Manu VIII. 400 says that kings have a monopoly as to elephants because it is well-known that they are most useful to them and he specifies certain monopolies such as those in saffron, silken cloth and wool, horses, pearls and jewels. Megasthenes (Fragment XXXVI. p. 90) states that a private person was not allowed to keep an elephant or a horse and that those animals were held to be the special property of the king. 

The king recovered a sort of road cess through officers called antapāla ( guardians of borders or boundaries ) viz. 11 pana on each cart loaded with merchandise, half a paṇa on each head of cattle, Ith pana on minor quadrupeds, and one māṣa on a load carried on a man's shoulders (Kaut. II. 21 p. 111). Sukra IV, 2. 129 permits for the repairs to the roads a tax on those who use roads. Revenues were raised in numerous other ways such as by charging for stamping weights and measures, by fees levied from keepers of gambling balls, from players, singers and musicians, from prostitutes, from forests and pastures &c. Brhat-Parāśara X. p. 282 allows the king in a financial crisis to use even temple funds and make them good when freed from his difficult position. Similarly it allows the king ( in difficulty ) to take the wealth of usurers, of low people,

The Rājatarangiṇi (VII. 1008 ) notices that a tax was levied on Kashmirians performing grāddha at Gayā. An inscrip tion of Vikramāditya V found near Gadag dated sake 934 ( 1012-13 A. D.) refers to taxes levied on upanayana, marriages, vedio sacrifices &c. (E. I. vol. 20 p. 64). It appears that the king of Anahilavād, Siddharāja (1094-1143 A. D.), levied a tax on pilgrims going to Somanātha at the frontier town Bāhuloda and it is said that the tax yielded 72 lakhs of rupees a year, which Siddharāja remitted for the sake of and at the inter vention of his mother ; vide Bom. G. vol. I. part 1 p. 17% and Prabandha-cintāmaṇi (p. 84, Tawney). The amount is probably very highly exaggerated in order to glorify Siddharāja, but this shows that the yield of the pilgrim tax must have been substantial. The Mānasollāsa in its great desire to help the king with the accumulation of wealth advises the king even to resort to alchemy. 255 

A question may be asked: what were the means of preven ting a king from being over-exacting and tyrannical in his taxes? Kaut. (VII. 5. pp. 276–277) cites at great length the causes that lead to the impoverishment of the subjects, to their being greedy and disaffected. Among these he mentions 256 

not paying what ought to be paid and exacting what ought not to be exacted, not punishing the guilty and severely punishing the guilty, not protecting the people against thieves and robbing them of their wealth'. He then states that when the subjects become impoverished they become greedy and when greedy they become disaffected and voluntarily go over to the side of the king's enemy or destroy their own king.

place Kautilya (XIII. 1) suggests 258 that a conqueror may employ spies who should encourage the subjects of his enemy suffering from famine, depredations of thieves and wild tribes to tell their king, 'we shall beg the king for favours (remission of taxes or help in the way of seeds &c.) but if he does not agree to bestow favours we shall go to another country'. So the threat of disaffection and migrating to another country were the deterrents against the tyranny of heavy taxation according to Kautilya. Sānti 87. 36 says 257a that if the vaisyas (gominah, who bore the brunt of taxation) were neglected, they may dis appear from the country and dwell in forests. Manu (VII. 111 112) warns kings who through folly rashly oppress their king doms that they may ere long lose their own lives and those of their relatives and also their kingdoms. Yāj. (I. 340-341 ) is even more emphatic and says that the king who seeks to increase his treasury with wealth extracted by unjust means from his realm loses his wealth in no time and meets destruction along with his relatives. The fire springing from the wrath caused by the harassment of the subjects does not coase without burning the family, the wealth and the life of the king.' Katyāyana (v. 19) harps on the spiritual consequences: the king who unjustly takes from his kingdom taxes, fines, share of crops and tolls, incurs 868 sin.' Sukra 259 (II. 319-321 and 370) emphasizes the keeping of daily, monthly and yearly accounts and the entering of the several items of income on the left side of the account and of those of expenditure on the right. The Nitivākyāmṛta esan refers to the appointment of auditors when there is discrepancy in the items of income and expenditure.

CHAPTER VIII 

BALA (THE ARMY). 

Bala is also called danda in Kaut and elsewhere. Accord ing to Sumantu dapda means 'punishment, corporal or monetary' and the army with its four arms is included by Sumantu under kośa ( acc. to $. V. p. 46).260 In the Rgveda we have frequent references to armies, weapons, battles &c. The word senāni occurs in Rg. X. 84. 2 where Manyu ( martial Fury ) is invoked to be the Commander.261 Rg. VI. 75 is full of references to bows, arrows, armour, bow-strings, quiver, charioteer, horses, chariots &c. Kām. (XIII. 34-37 ) states that the king possessed of a sound financial position increases his depleted army, supports his own subjects and is depended upon even by his enemies. All the following result from the possession of a (powerful ) army viz. increase of the wealth of one's friends and enemies and of the ( king's) territories, prompt attainment of objects that seemed distant, protection of what is already secur ed, destruction of the armies of the enemy, the keeping together of one's army. Most authorities agree in saying that troops are of six kinds viz. maula (hereditary ), bhrta or bhṛtaka or bhitya (hired troops ), śreni (guild troops ), mitra ( troops of an ally or friendly power or feudatories ), amitra ( troops that once belonged to the enemy ), atavi or ātavika (wild tribes as troops). Vide Kaut. 242 IX. % (first sentence ), Kām. XVIII. 4, Agnipurāna 242. 1-2, Mānasollāsa ( II. 6, verge 556 p. 76). The first three works say that each earlier variety of troops is superior to each later one. Maula troops corresponded to the modern standing army, since Kaut. (IX. 2) prefers them on the ground that they depend on the king for maintenance and are being constantly drilled. They most probably consisted of persons who and whose ancestors got tax-free lands in lieu of military service. The Sabba parva 5, 63 appears to refer to four kinds ( omitting śreni and amitra ) and Yuddhakanda 17. 24 refers to five ( omitting śrepi).

Kinds of armed forces 

201 

The Asramavāsikaparva 263 (7.7-8) names five kinds (except amitra ) and states that maula and mitra armies are superior to the rest and hired troops and śreṇi troops are each other's equals. This division of armies into various kinds is mentioned in the grant of Dhruvasena I of Valabhi in Gupta-Valabhi year 206 (E. I. vol. XI. p. 106, where the king is said to have acquired the kingdom with the help of maula, bhrta, mitra and śreni armies ). Mānasollāsa defines the atavika 264 army as consisting of niṣādas, mlecchus and similar castes dwelling in the vicinity of mountains and amitra troops as soldiers who once belonged to an enemy king but being defeated were taken captive and made slaves. Accord ing to the Rājanitiratnākara (p. 38) 'aribala' means 'troops that come to a king after leaving the king's enemy'. Kām. XVIII. 7 says that the ātavika troops are, by nature, irreligious, greedy, smāryas and non-observers of truth. They correspond to the pendharis and freebooters of later times. The reasons why hered itary and other troops are superior to amitra and āṭavika varie ties are explained at great length by Kaut. IX. 2 and Kām. XVIII. 5-9. Kaut. (IX. 2) states that an amitru army led by an ārya is superior to wild tribe troops. Both of them are out for plunder and in case no plunder can be had or when there is a disaster they may prove as dangerous as snakes. By greni-bala he has in mind the organized bands of soldiers to whom he refers elsewhere as ' vārtāśastropajivinah' (vide p. 89 above ). As it is not unlikely that members of trade-guilds either them. selves learnt the profession of arms or engaged soldiers for the protection of their merchandise and property, these could be pressed into his service by a king in case of need and were distinguished from the hereditary army and hired troops as 

sreni-bala'. Differing from the ācāryas that troops composed of brāhmaṇas, ksatriyas, vaiśyas and sūdras are superior for en listment in the order of the castes, Kaut. holds that an army of ksatriyas well-trained in the wielding of arms or an army of

vaiśgas and sūdras having greater numerical strength is better than an army composed of brāhmaṇa soldiers, since an enemy may win over the latter army by prostrating himself before them. 26 Vide H. Dh. vol. II, pp. 122-123 for discussion on the question whether brāhmaṇas could become soldiers. In Udyoga parva 96.7 (cr. ed. chap. 94 ) it is said that king Dambhod bhava every day asked in the morning whether there was any śūdra, vaisya, ksatriya or brahmana equal or superior to him in armed conflict. That shows that soldiers of castes other than kṣatriyas were not unheard of in the Epic age. Kām. IV. ( 63, 65, 67 ) says that the hereditary army (pitr-paitāmaha) should consist mostly of ksatriyas. In the Maliya copperplate of Mahārāja Dharasena II ( 252 Valabhi samvat i. e. 571-72 A. D.) Bhaṭārka, the founder of the Valabhi dynasty, is said to have secured the kingdom with the help of maula, bhsta, mitra and śreṛi troops (Gupta Inscriptions p. 165 ). Sukra (II. 137-139 ) says that the soldiers may be sūdras, kṣatriyas, vaisyas, mlecchas or of mixed castes, provided they are brave, restrained, well-built, devoted to their master and their dharma, and hate the enemy. Santi (101. 3-5) describes in what respects soldiers from Gandhāra, Sindhu and other countries and Yavana and Deccan soldiers excel, remarks that brave and strong men are to be found everywhere (verse 6 ) and that men from the border (i. e. bhillas and kaivartas accord ing to Nilakaptha ) are desperate fighters, would never run away from battle and so should be preferred for enlistment in the army (verse 19). The Yasastilaka III (pp. 461-467) describes the characteristics of Northern Indian (auttarāpatha), Deccan (dākṣiṇātya), Dramila (South Indian), Tirhut (Taira bhukta) and Gurjara soldiers. An army was said to be composed of four parts, viz. elephants, horses, chariots and foot-soldiers (caturanga bala). Kām. XVIII. 24 says that bala is sixfeld, viz. the four sections of infantry, cavalry, chariots and elephants together with mantra (line of policy) and kośa (treasury). In Sānti. 103. 38 the army is said to have six angas (the well known four plus kośa and roads for traffic). According to Kautilya (II. %, VII. 11) and Kām. XIX, 62 the destruction of

the enemy's forces and victory depended on elephants.286 Santi parva (100. 24) says that an army in which the infantry pre dominates remains firm and that cavalry and chariots are all right when there is no rain. Sānti (59. 41-42) enumerates eight elements of the army viz. the well-known four (elephants etc.), visti (labourers or porters who gave free labour and were only fed but were paid no wages ), boats, spies, and guides (deśika). 267 Vide Santi 121. 44 also. In the Mahābhārata elephants do not, except in rare cases, play any role in the fighting that went on, while chariots and the other arms of an army are described everywhere. In the Virātaparva ( 65. 6) Vikarna was seated on an elephant when he attacked Arjuna; Bhiṣmaparva 20.7 refers to Duryodhana as riding an elephant and (95. 32-33) Bhagadatta is described as seated on an elephant when he attacked Bhima. In this respect the Epic carries on the vedic tradition. Megasthenes (Fragment 1 p. 30) notes that in ancient India elephants were trained for war and turned the scale of victory. Vast armies were kept by ancient kings and emperors. When Satrughna started against the demon Lavana he had an army of 4000 horses, 2000 chariots and 100 elephants with him (Rāmāyaṇa VII. 64. 2-4). In the Dasakumāracarita VIII the cynical jester Viharabhadra reminds his master that the latter had 10000 elephants, three lakhs of horse and numberless foot-soldiers (B. S. S. p. 133, of ed. of 1919).

Megasthenes (in Fragment XXVII p. 68) speaks of the camp of Sandrakottos (Candragupta Maurya) that had 400000 men, notes ( in Fragment LVI) that the king of Palibothra had in his pay a standing army of six lakhs of foot-soldiers, 30000 cavalry and 9000 elephants (p. 141, McCrindle ), that the king of Horatae (Surāṣtra ) had 150000 foot-soldiers, 5000 cavalry and 1600 elephants (ibid p. 150 ) and that even the Pāudyan kingdom ruled by women had 150000 foot and 500 elephants (ibid. p. 147). Vide Beal's 'Buddhist Records &c.' vol. I. p. 213 for the armies collected by Harga in his march against the murderer of his elder brother (viz. 5000 elephants, 2000 horse and 50000 foot-soldiers ) and the vast armies that he had after six years of conquest viz. 60000 elephants and 100000 cavalry. In the Asvamedhikarparya ( 60. 14-20 ) it is narrated that when Drona assunied the post of commander-in-chief the Kaurava army had been reduced to 9 akṣuuhinis from eleven, that only five were left when Karna became Senāpati and the Pandavas had then only three left and under Salya's command there were only three akṣauhiṇis and the Pandavas could oppose to him only one. In reply to a question from Dhrtarāstra Yudhisthira states that in the great war the total number of warriors killed in battle came to the colossal figure of 1660020006 ( Striparva 26. 9).268 The Udyogaparva gives ( 155, 24-26 ) the following table for an akṣauhiṇi : 500 elephants, 500 chariots, 1500 cavalry and 2500 foot-soldiers constituted an army called senā, 10 senās= prtanā, 10 prianās=vāhini, 10 vāhinis=dhvajini, 10 dhvajinis = cumū and 10 camūs=aksauhiṇi. The Kauravas had eleven akṣauhinis and the Pandavas had 7. If we take the table in Adi 2. 19-22 one akṣauhini contained 21870 elephants, the sanie number of chariots, 65610 horses and 109350 foot-soldiers. 264 But if the other tables be followed then the numbers may be much larger still. Another table furnished by Udyogaparva. 155. 28-29 is : 55 men constituted patti, 3 pattis senāmukha or gulma, 3 gulmas = gana and there were ayutas (10 thousands ) of gañas in the army of the Kauravas.

differs from both tables in some respects. The Udyogaparva 155, 22 further notes that each horseman was surrounded by ten men attendants (narā daśa hayaścāsan pādarakṣāḥ samantataḥ). Though throughout the centuries the infantry was theoretically and in practice more numerous than cavalry, not much importance seems to have been attached to them as compared with chariots or horsemen. The lexicon called Vaijayanti says that patti consists of three horses, five foot soldiers, one chariot and one elephant, that three pattis are equal to senāmukha and that senāmukha, gulma, gana, vābini, pitanā, camũ, anikini represent each three times as many as the preceding one and that 10 anikinis are equal to an akṣauhiṇi, The Nitiprakāśikā 870 gives a table of groups from patti to akṣauhini and remarks that each of these groups had in turn numerous supporting men e. g. each elephant was followed by a hundred horsemen and a thousand foot-soldiers and each horse man was supported by a thousand foot-soldiers ( VII. 3-10 ). Manu VII. 192 refers to battles on water also. From references in the Mahābhārata it appears that chariots had only two wheels. Vide Bhiṣma 98. 47, Dronaparva 154. 3, Salya 16. 24 (Śaineyo dakṣiṇam cakram Dhrstadyumnas-tathottaram). Two noted warriors were told off to guard the two wheels of the chariot of the principal commanders and are called 'cakra-rakṣau' ( vide Bhisma 54. 76, 108. 5, Drona 91, 36, Karpa 11, 31, 34, 44). Chariots of great warriors were drawn by four horses e. g. Adi. 198. 15, Udyoga 48. 50, Droṇa 145. 81. Udyoga 83. 15-21 describe the chariot of Krspa and Udyoga 140. 21 states that chariots had small tinkling bells attached to them and also screens of tiger-skin. The Rg. contains very graphic descriptions of chariots. Chariots were generally drawn by two horses in the vedic age (Rg. V. 30. I, V. 36.5, VI. 23. 1) and had two wheels, but the chariot of the. Aśvins is described as having three wheels (Rg. I. 118. 2, I. 157. 3, X. 41. 1). Ghatotkaca, however, had eight wheels to his chariot (Droṇa 156. 61, 175. 13). The Sukranitisāra (II. 140-148) mentions another method of grouping the army. Five or six foot-soldiers made a patti over which there

was an officer called puttipa, over 30 pattipālas there was the gaulmika, over 100 gaulmikas was the officer called satanika, who had as his assistants an officer called anuśatika, a senānı and a lekhaka (scribe ); the officer over twenty elephants or horses was called nāyaka ( compare modern "naik"). Each of these officers should have a distinctive badge indicative of their position. Ayodhyā 100. 32 ( =Sabhā 5. 48) asks: 'I hope you give at the proper time pay and rations to your soldiers according to their deserts and do not delay payment'. Both Nār. (sambhūya-22) and Br. state that among persons who work for hire the best is the soldier. The Mānasollaga ( II. 6. 566-569 p. 80) describes that the chiefs of the hereditary army should always be honoured by the king with presents of jewels, ornaments, costly clothes and sweet words and sumptuous provision for their maintenance should be made by bestowing on them a village, or two or more villages and heaps of gold, while hired soldiers should be paid every day or every month or once in three, four or six months or once in a year according to the needs of the king. Megasthenes (Frag ment XXXIV p. 88 ) describes the organization of the Indian army: 'A third governing body directs military affairs, of which there were six divisions with five members to each. One co-operates with the admiral of the fleet, another with the superintendent of bullock trains, the third division has charge of foot-soldiers, the fourth of horses, the fifth of war chariots and the sixth of elephants. In medieval times chariots appear to have become obsolete. In the graphic descriptions of armies contained in the Harṣacarita ( particularly in the 7th ucchvāsa ) war chariots are conspicuous by their absence. The Mahābhārata often speaks of horses from the countries to the north-west of India as the best; vide Sabhā 53. 5 (for Kamboja and Gāndhāra horses ), Udyoga 86. 6 (horses from 

Balhi), Drona 125. 25 and Sauptika 13.2 (Kamboja horses). The Harṣacarita II speaks of the best horses as coming from Vanāyu, Aratta, Kamboja, Sindhudesa and Pārasika. Sukra lays down certain practical rules about the army (IV, 7. 379-390). He says that the soldiers should be encamped outside the town or village but not far from it, that no money-lending should be allowed between the soldiers and the village people, that the king should open separate shops for goods required by soldiers, that no army should be encamped at one place for more than a year, that soldiers should not enter the village without the king's permission, that receipts should be taken from soldiers

for payments made to them and they should be furnished with a writing about their pay. Some of these rules are very old. The Udyogaparva 471 37. 30 mentions among persons with whom no contractual transactions should be entered into, the king, the king's servants and soldiers. 

The Artbaśāstra contains an elaborate discussion (in IX. 1-7 and X, 1-6) about the organization of the king's army, the proper time and place for starting on an invasion, internal and external troubles and calamities and measures against them, means of dealing with traitors and enemies, religious remedies (worshipping gods and falling at the feet of brāhmaṇas, magical rites based upon the Atharvaveda) against misfortunes like fire and flood, epidemics, famine &c., encampinent ( skandhāvāra ) of armies, treacherous and strategic fighting, proper battle grounds, encouragement to one's own army, free labourers and their work, different arrangements or formations (vyūhas ) of armies. Considerations of space prevent any treatment of these matters. But a few notable points will be set out here. A king may invade his enemy's country either in Mārgasirṣa ( when the crops sown in the rains are ready ) or in Caitra or when the enemy is suffering from some calamity. Sānti (100. 10-11 ) says the same thing. Internal trouble arises when any minister, purohita, senāpati or the crown prince is angry or dissatisfied with the king, who should get rid of such trouble by giving up his own fault or by pointing out the danger arising from an enemy. If the crown prince causes trouble he should be kept in confinement or killed, if there is another son of good character, The trouble caused by a provincial Governor or the officer in charge of boundaries (antapāla), the chief of wild tribes or a conquered king is termed external. The king should meet it by setting up one against the other. The encampment of an army is to be made on a site declared to be the best according to the science of buildings and measured by the nāyaka ( the chief of the army), carpenter and astrologer, the encampment being circular, square or rectangular and having four gates, six roads and nine divisions. Disputes, drinking, holding merry gather ings ( samāja ) and gambling should be prohibited in the camp and the system of passes should be enforced (X. 1). Vanaparva ( 15. 14, 19 ) also refers to the system of passes and the faot that

dancers and musicians were driven away, when Dvārakā was besieged by sālva. From Udyoga 151. 58 (cr. ed. 149.53), 195. 12-19 (cr. ed. 196. 12-19) it appears that markets, prosti tutes, conveyances, oxen, machines, arms and physicians accompanied an army and that the camp (senānivesa or skandhāvāra) of Duryodhana looked like the capital itself and was five yojanas in extent. Physicians with surgical instruments, blunt instruments (like tweezers ), medicines, curative oils and handages in their hands and women ( nurses ) looking after the food and drink of the army should stand behind the soldiers uttering encouraging words 278 (Kaut X. 3). The Bhiṣmaparva 120.55 also states that doctors well-versed in extraoting splinters or arrow-heads (froni the body ) approached with their Burgical instruments to extract the darts from Bhiṣma's body. The duties of the labourers (viṣti) were to examine the camp, roads, bridges, wells, and river ghats, to carry machines, weapons, armour, utensils, fodder, to remove from the battle-field wounded men along with their weapons and armour.278 Each commander had some distinguishing device as his banner e. g. Bhisma had a golden tāla tree as his standard (Bhiṣmaparva VI. 17. 18, tālena mahatā Bhiệmah pañcatāreṇa ketunā). In X. 6 Kautilya speaks of several formations (vyūhas) called danda, bhoga; mandala, aśanihata and the subdivisions such as gomūtrikā, makara &c. In Kām, XVIII. 48-49, XIX. 40 ff., Manu VII. 187–191, Nitiprakāśikā, chap. 6 and in the Mahābhārata many vyūhas are described. Vanaparva (285. 6-7) refers to Rāvaṣa's arrangement of his army according to the rules of Usanas and of Rama's army according to Bārhaspatya rules. The Asrama vāsikaparva 7. 15 refers to the formations called Sakata, Padma and Vajra described in the work of Uśanas. Kautilya X. 6 also refers to Auśanasa and Bārhaspatya arrangements of armies. Drona 75, 27, 87, 22-24, Karpaparva 11. 14 and 28 mention certain vyūbas like Makara, Sakata &c. Vide also Manasollasa II. 20 verses 1170-1181 pp. 134-135, Agnipurāna 242. 7-8 and 42-73 for vyūhas.

High ideals in warfare 

209 

Mahabharata holds up a high ideal. The Bhismaparva ar4 21. 10 remarks that conquerors do not secure victory so much by their armies and prowess as by truthfulness, freedom from cruelty, the observance of dharma and energetic actions. The Santi parva ( 95. 17-18) states that it is better to die while fighting according to the rules of dharma rather than obtain a victory by wicked actions. 

____ In the Bhismaparva (I. 27-32) certain rules of war agreed upon between the Kauravas and the Pandavas are set out, such as one should fight only with one similarly equipped (i. e. a foot soldier with a foot-soldier and so on), one should not kill a soldier who is already in combat with another, or who has turned back from fight or is without armour. Ap. Dh. S. II. 5. 10. 12, Gaut. x. 17-18, Yaj. I. 326, Manu VII. 90-93, Santi 95.7-14,96.3, Santi 98. 48-49,297.4, Dronaparva 143.8, Karna90.111-113, Sauptika 5. 11-12, 6. 21-23, Saṅkha (quoted by the Mit. on Yaj. I. 326), Baud. Dh. S. I. 10. 10-12, Vrddha-Harita. VII. 226, Brhat-Parasara x. p. 281, Sukra IV. 7. 354-362, Yuddha-kanda. 18. 27-28 contain rules of war dictated by noble sentiments of humanity and chivalry. Some of these ( that will bear comparison with the conventions of the Geneva and Hague Conferences) are set out here. Gaut. (X. 17-18 ) 875 states: 'no sin is committed by injuring or slaying men in battle excepting him who has lost his horse, charioteer or weapons, him who joins his hands ( in supplication for life ), whose hair are dishevelled (in flying), who turns away from the field, who sits down, who climbs an eminence or a tree (in flight), except envoys or messengers, except him who declares himself to be a cow or a brahmana'. Vrddha-Harita. VII. 216 exempts spectators. Manu (VII.90-93) declares "one should not fight with treacherous

(or concealed ) weapons, or with barbed or poisoned weapong or with weapons the points of which are blazing with fire. Let a fighter not strike one who has climbed on an eminence, nor a eunuch, nor one who joins the palms of his hand ( ip supplica tion), nor one with flying hair ( in flight), nor one who sits down or says 'I am thine', nor one who is asleep, nor one who has lost armour, nor one who is naked or disarmed, nor one who is merely looking on without taking part in the fight, nor one who is fighting with another foe, nor one whose weapons are broken, nor one who is afflicted with sorrow, nor one seriously wounded, nor one who is in fear, nor one who has turned to flee.'' Saṅkha adds that a soldier should not kill another while the latter is drinking water or taking his meals or is taking off his shoes, nor should one kill a woman, a female elephant, nor a charioteer, nor a bard nor a brāhmaṇa nor should one who is not a king (or noble) kill one who is a king. Baud. Dh. S.I. 10. 10 forbids the use of poisoned or barbed arrows ( karnin). Santi 95. 11 also does the same. Sānti ( 95. 13-14 ) enjoins that even an enemy soldier, when wounded, should be treated with medicine and allowed to go when his wounds are healed, 176 Śānti adds that a soldier should not kill boys or old men nor from behind nor one who holds a blade of grass in his mouth (as a mark of submission). These rules, though probably ideal and not strictly followed in every case, are far more humane as compared with the practice in modern warfare when non combatants are killed from the air even at night without warn ing. In ancient times non-combatants went generally un molested, to which Megasthenes bears testimony when he says (Frag. I. p. 32 ) Tillers of the soil even when battle is raging in the neighbourhood are undisturbed by any sense of danger, for the combatants allow those engaged in husbandry to remain quite unmolested,' Manu VII. 32 allows a king to harass his enemy's country, but Medbātithi on VII. 32 asks the invader to save his enemy's people if possible (particularly brābmapas). The rule in gudāyuddha (fight with maces or clubs ) was that no blow was to be struck below the navel ( Salyaparva 60. 6). But this rule was violated by Bhima when he struck Duryodbana on the thigh with his mace. Duryodhana recounts ( in Salya 61 . all the bad deeds of Krspa and the Pāndavas and the only reply that Krsna makes is that he too was guilty of

numerous breachey of morality and the chivalrous rules of war ( such as the slaying of Abhimanyu by many engaging him at one time ). The general rule was that fighting ceased when the sun went down ( Bhisma 49. 52-53 ). But in Dronaparva 154 and 163. 16 ff. we have a description of night battles and it is provided that chariots, elephants and horses should carry lamps. 

It has already been shown how it was the duty of a ksatriya and of every soldier to fight and die in battle rather than run away. A fighting spirit was inculcated by holding out several rewards. One was the acquisition of booty and territory (Gaut. X. 41, Manu VII. 206, Bhagavadgita II. 37); others were the satisfaction of having done one's duty as a kṣatriya (Gita II. 31-33), honour and fame (Gita II. 34-35), heaven and other-worldly rewards (Yāj. I. 324, Manu VII. 88-89), protection of brāhmaṇas (Ap. Dh. S. II. 10. 26. 2-3). Visṇu Dh. S. III. 44-46 have already been quoted above (p. 58). The Śānti (98. 40-41) states that a soldier who runs away from the field falls into Hell. Yāj. (I. 324-325) declares that those who, while fighting with weapons that are not treacherous (poisoned &c.) for the sake of the land (of their master or of the enemy) die in battle without turning back from it go to heaven like yogins, that each step of those who do not flee even when their comrades have been killed is equal to a solemn sacrifice (like the Asyamedha); the king (the master) takes away all the merit of thoge who run away from the battlefield and are then killed. Manu VII. 95 contains the same idea. These remarks were applicable not only to ksatriya soldiers, but to soldiers of all castes who maintained themselves by following the pro fession of arms. Vide Rājanītiprakāśa p. 407. Parāsara (III. 31) and Bṛhat-Parāśara X. p. 281 remark that a valiant soldier who does not seek mercy though surrounded by many enemies and falls fighting attains imperishable worlds and that when he reaches heaven divine damsels run after him to choose him as their Lord ( III. 34-35).

one of the two quoted by Kaut. (X.3) when soldiers are to be urged on to fight. Kautilya (in X. 3) advises that the king him. self and his mantrin and purohita should urge on his soldiers by quoting Vedic and classical Sanskrit passages about the rewards waiting for those who fall fighting for their master and the religious punishments for those who run away. Astrologers should infuse spirit into their side by asserting that the heavenly aspects favour their side. The day before the battle the king should observe a fast, offer oblations into fire to the accom paniment of Atharvaveda mantras and cause benedictory texts to be repeated that refer to victory. Bards should recite lays describing heaven as the reward for the brave and hell for the timid and extol the caste, guild, family, deeds and character of the soldiers. The assistants of the purohita should declare that they have practised witchcraft against the enemy. The commander in-chief and the officers under him should address the army as follows:-'a hundred thousand (panas) will be the reward for him who kills the enemy king, fifty thousand for him who kills the commander-in-chief or the crown prince, .......... a hundred for slaying the officer of the patti (a battalion), twenty for bringing the head (of a common soldier) and twice the pay and the booty seized by each to all soldiers'. Kām. (XIX. 18-21) says that the king should give the rewards (promised as in Kaut.) to the soldiers after they succeed in the exploits men tioned. Vide also Mānasollāsa II. 20 verses 1163–1167 (pp. 133 134) for similar promises. Gaut. (X. 20-23) prescribes that whatever wealth is acquired by a soldier by bis individual effort should be given to him by the king, but the horse or elephant caught by a soldier goes to the king, that if many soldiers by a joint effort obtain some valuable plunder the king should choose and retain the best for himself and the rest should be divided among the soldiers according to their services in the battle. Vide Manu VII. 96-97 (which allow even & chariot, horse or elephant to be retained as booty by the soldier and everything else including female slaves, except jewels, gold and silver), Kām. XIX. 278 21-22, Sukra IV, 7. 372. 

A treatise will be required to deal with the weapons of war from ancient times. Even in the Rgveda several weapons are mentioned e. g. rsti (Rg. V. 52.6, V. 57.2 and 6 on the shoulders

of the Maruts), arrows (V. 57,2, VI. 75. 17), quivers (V. 57. 2), the ankusa (of Indra in VIII. 17. 10, X. 44. 9), paraśu (X. 28.8), kspāṇa (probably a dagger, in X. 22. 10), vajra made of ayas (X. 48.3, X. 113.5). Atharvaveda IV, 6.6. refers to poisoned arrows. In the Atharvaveda 879 I. 16.% and 4 reference is made to lead as destroying sorcerers and it is said “if you kill our cow or horse or man we shall pierce you with lead so that you will cease to kill our strong men'. In Tai. S. I. 5.7.6 it is said €80 that when a samidh is offered into fire with the mantra 'indhānās-tvā satam himāḥ' the sacrificer discharges against his enemy the sataghni ( weapon killing a hundred) which acts like vajra itself'. Dr. Oppert in his Introduction to the Nitiprakāsika pp. 10-13 relies on these and other passages for holding that the ancient Indians knew fire-arms and that Atharvaveda I. 16.4 refers to leaden balls discharged from cylinders. Vide Dr. Oppert's work on the 'weapons, army organisation and political maxims of the ancient Hindus (1880), where he describes several weapons and holds that gunpowder was known in India long before the 13th century A. D. Mr. G. T. Date's 'Art of war in Ancient India' (London 1929), Dr. P. C. Chakravarti's work (1941, Dacca) and Prof. Dikshitar's book on the same subject may be consulted for details. The numerous weapons mentioned in the Mahabharata (e. g. Udyoga 155. 3-9) also are passed over here. Vide Hop. king' paper in J. A. O. S. Vol. XIII pp. 269-303 for detailed descriptions. The Allahabad Stone Pillar Inscription of Samu dragupta (middle of 4th century A. D.) contains a long list of we apons (C I I. III pp. 6–7).2804 One important question is whether gunpowder and fire-arms were known to our ancient and medieval works. Sukra refers to gunpowder called agnicūrna in II. 93,196, IV. 7. 203, guns (IV. 7. 209-211 ) and gives the formula of gunpowder in IV. 7. 201 (viz. the mixing of five palas of salt petre, one pala of sulphur and one pala of coal powder). The Sukranitisāra is comparatively a late work and was probably

written in the L3th or 14th century when cannon came to be used in Europe for the first time. Both in the Rāmāyaṇa and the Mahābhārata the word sataghni ( killing a hundred people ) occurs frequently. In the Yuddhakānda 281 3. 13 it is stated that at the gates of Lankā hundreds of iron sataghnis, looking burnished, sharp and terrible, bad been arranged by the demons, In a poetic description of Lanka in the Sundarakānda chap. 2, it is said that sataghnis and sūlas were like the hair on the head of Lankā (verse 21). In the Vanaparva 15 there is a fine description of Dvāravatl (Dvārka) besieged by Śālva, in which it is said that the capital had numerous towers and turrets, machines, tomaras, askusas, sataghnis &c. In Adi. 207. 34, Vanaparva 169. 16, 284.5, 290, 24, Drona 156, 70, Karna 11. 8, Salya 45. 110 the sataghni is Inentioned, but it is impossible to find from these what exactly it was like. From Vanaparva 284. 31 it appears that the sataghnis were discharged with force by the hands and had wheels and round balls or stones in it. In Drona 179. 46 it is said that the sataghni employed by Ghatotkaca had wheels and killed four horses at once. In Droṇa 199. 19 sataghnis are said to have two or four wheels. In Vanaparva 282 284. 4 it is said that the powder of sarjarasa ( resin from Sal tree ) had been collected. In the Harivamsa ( Bhavisyaparva 44. 20 ), among the weapons hurled at Narasimha by Hiraṇyakaśipu were blazing sataghnis (sataghnibhiśca diptabhir-daṇdairapi sudāruṇaih). In Rāmāyaṇa VII. 32. 44 we are told that at the tip of the weapon called musala ( club) blazed forth fire like a bunch of Asoka flowers. The Sundarakānda couples together sataghni and musala ( 4, 18). It looks probable that resinous powder was used in some cylindrical contrivance (or rockets) mounted on wheels and capable of throwing stones. But gunpowder appears not to have been used. There is no description of smoke due to sataghnis. Hopkins (J. A. O. S. XIII pp. 299-303 ) holds that gunpowder and fire-arms were unknown to the great Epic and in the present state of our knowledge this view seems to be correct. 

The Nitiprakāśikā (chapters %-5) names and describes numerous weapons divided into four classos viz. mukta ( thrown

or discharged such as arrows), amukta (not thrown such as swords ), muktamukta (thrown and not thrown, such as astras which after discharge can be taken back) and mantramukta (astras which cannot be taken back ). The Agnipurana ( 249 252 ) and the Viṣnudharmottara ( II 178-182) give a summary of the Dhanurveda (both agreeing almost word for word, but the latter containing more verses than the former ) and speak of five kinds of weapons viz. yantramukta ( discharged from a machine, a sling, bow &c. ), pāṇimukta ( thrown with the hand such as a stone or tomara ), muktā mukta (like a prāga ), amukta (sword) and niyuddha or bahuyuddha ( wrestling). The science of astras was of a supernatural kind. In the epics and purānas, the great heroes are said to have learnt astravidyā either from a teacher or from their father or by practising austerities and sometimes (as in the case of Kuśa and Lava) certain astras pass to the son by the mere fact of his birth and the wish of his father. Whether the Dhanurveda often referred to in the epics had consign ed this science of astras to writing and could have enabled a reader to possess the miraculous powers attributed to astras is more than a modern can say. The Agnipurāṇa (chap. 134-135) contains magical incantations for victory in war and conquest of the worlds. The Paraśurāmapratāpa (Rājavallabhakānda folios 9-12 ) contains numerous mantras apd yantras and incanta tions derived from Tantra works like the Brahmayamala. 

The Mahabharata is careful to point out that an army consti tutes the most inferior kind of bala (power). Udyogaparva (37. 59-55 ) states that bala is of five kinds viz. brute force (bahubala ), that due to the acquisition of ministers ( amatya. lābha ), that derived from wealth ( dhanalābha ), that from noble descent (abhijātubala) and the power of wisdom (prajñābala), which last is the best of all. These are quoted by the Budhabhūgana p. 79. In Santi. 134. 8 it is said 883 that there is nothing that the strong cannot accomplish and that whatever the strong do is pure. In another place it is said ' everything is wholesome to the powerful'( Aśramavāsi 30. 24). In Adi 175.45 a warrior's power is scorned and the power of the spiritual merit of brāhmaṇas is extolled as the real power.

CHAPTER IX SUHRT OR MITRA (ALLY OR FRIEND). 

Manu inculcates the necessity of making friends in VII. 208 and cites the qualities of a good friend (for. a king) 'a king does not prosper by the acquisition of gold and land so much as by securing a firm friend who would be powerful in future, though he may be of depleted resources at the time. That friend, though a weak one, is commended, who is righteous, grateful, whose subjects (or ministers) are contented, who is attached and who pursues (to the end) work undertaken'. According to Manu VII. 206 land, gold and ally are the three fruits of royal endeavour or policy. Yāj I. 352 is similar to Manu VII. 208. In VII. 9 Kautilya in opposition to the above holds that the acquisition of land is better than that of gold and friend and the acquisition of gold is superior to that of a friend284. The Mahā. bharata (Santi 138.110) states 'no one is the friend or enemy of any one else; friends or enemies are made by wealth (or objects pursued by a person):285 Kām. VIII. 52 says the same. Sukra. (IV. 1.8-10) opines' in the case of a brave, energetic, strong and politic king all others, though outwardly friendly, secretly cherish enmity to bim and only wait for (the proper) time to strike). There is no wonder in this. Are they not themselves greedy of conquering territories? A king has no friend and he is the friend of none'. Santi (80. 3) says286 that a friend is of four kinds, one who has the same goal, one who comes for protec tion or security, one who is naturally go and one who is acqui. red. Karnaparva 88. 28 gives the four kinds somewhat diffe rently viz. natural (sahaja), acquired by conciliatory words,

won by wealth and one drawn by one's prowess. Kām. (IV. 74) says that a mitra is of four kinds viz. by birth (such as one's father's father, mother &c.), made by relationship (i. e. marriage), hereditary (one's father's friend), one who is saved from calamities.287 According to Kām. (IV.75-76) the qualities of a friendly king are purity (of heart), liberality, bravery, sharing happiness and sorrow, affection, vigilance (to carry out one's friend's object), truth; and briefly the characteristic of a true friend is devotion to the objects desired by his friend. The purpose for which & friend is made is to secure one of the three purusārthas, dharma, artha and kāma (Kām. IV. 72). 

This subject of making friends leads on to the well-known theory of mandala i. e, of inter-state relationship. Kaut. VI. 2 and VII, Manu VII. 154-211, Aśramyāsiparva 6-7, Yāj. I. 345 348, Kam. VIII-XI, Agnipurāṇa 233 and 240, Viṣnudharmottara II. 145-150, Nitivākyāmsta pp. 317-343, Rājanitiprakāśa pp. 316 330, Nitimayūkha pp. 44-46 deal with this theory of mandala and the six gurus at great length. As the Kauṭiliya is probably the earliest of these and contains the most elaborate treatment of the subject, a brief outline from it is presented here. The Nitivākyāmsta (pp. 311-313) copies the very words of Kautilya. 

The yogakṣema (welfare) of a State springs from peace (sama) and exertion (vyāyāma). The latter achieves the com pletion of works undertaken, while śama brings about the undis turbed enjoyment of the fruits of undertakings. The (proper) employment of the six gunas ( sandhi &c.) is the source of sama and vyāyāma. What results (uday) from these six guṇas is either deterioration, stagnation or progress. Udaya depends upon human and divine causes which together govern the world. The human ones are naya and apunaya. Human causes are seen (anticipated) and can be operated (by men). Naya (good policy) is that out of the human causes from which results yogakṣema (welfare); apanaya (impolitic way) is that which produces loss (or an unfavourable state). In VI. 1 (last verbe) Kautilya says that a king who understands naya and is endowed with the ātmagunas and all the elements of the State will conquer the whole world, though originally he may have a small king dom. The mandala theory is set out in relation to a king who

is called vijigiṣu ( the ambitious ruler or conqueror). Kām. VIII 6 defines 288 vijigiṣu as a king who aspires to extend his terri tories, who is possessed of all the seven elements of sovereignty. who has great energy and who makes great efforts. In verses 7-11 he mentions at length his qualities. All our works place before kings this ideal of conquest, domination or self-aggran dizement at the expense of one's weak neighbours. A vijigiṣu is a king who is endowed with good qualities (called ātmasampat on p. 45 above) and with the several elements of the State and who is the fountain of policy (naya), i.e. who has a definite good policy to pursue. An ari (actual or potential enemy) is a king or kings who are the immediate neighbours on the circum ference of the kingdom of the vijigiṣu. From this it follows that ari may comprehend one king, two kings or more who are the immediate neighbours of the vijigiṣu. But it should be remembered as insisted upon by the Nitivākyāmrta289 (p. 321 that there is no inflexible rule that the immediate neighbour is an enemy and that the king whose dominion is beyond the imme diate neighbour will be a friend. Contiguity or distance is not necessarily the cause of friendship or enmity, but rather it is the purpose (or object) that makes friends or enemies. All that is meant is that the immediate neighbour is most likely to be an ari (a real or potential enemy). A mitra (friend of the vijigisu) is he who is separated (from the vijigiṣu) by the intervention of the kingdom of the ari. A satru is a neighbouring ruler posses sed of the characteristics of an enemy 290 (detailed in Kaut. VI. 1). The yātavya (to be attacked or invaded by the vijigiṣu) is an ari who is involved in difficulties. From this it is clear that in the terminology of Kautilya ari is a generic expression including actual and potential enemies who will generally be on the borders of the kingdom of the vijigiṣu. A satru is an ari who invites attack or destruction or harassment or reduction. That enemy who is plunged in vices or calamities may be

attacked and is then called yātavya 291 ; one who has no support or has only a weak support is to be extirpated; an enemy who is the opposite of this last (ie. who has a support or strong support) is to be either harassed or to be reduced. Support (asraya) means a strong fort or a good friend (Kām. VIII. 60). So that a satru is of four sorts (yātavya, ucchedya, pidanlya, karsaniya). Harassment is caused to him who is without mantra and a strong army, while one who is strong in mantra and army is to be rendered weak in these respects. Both a satru or a mitra are of three kinds, sahaja, krtrima and prākrta. A sahaja (natural) friend is one' who is related through one's parents (such as maternal or paternal aunt's son); one who is resorted to for wealth or safety is kṣtrima (acquired) i. e. one who has obliged the vijigiṣu or has been under his obligations; and the king who is next to the neighbour (i. e. who is separated from the vijigiṣu by the intervention of the neighbour king) is prāksta (i. e. because he is a praksti, an element in the mandala theory ). A sahaja enemy is one who is born of the same family (such as a step-brother), a kṛirimu is one who is antagonistic or incites antagonists (i. e. one who has caused harm to or who has been harmed by the vijigiṣu), while the immediate neighbour is a prūksta enemy. The Mit. on Yāj. I. 345 very concisely but lucidly explains all these and the four kinds of satru. The Viṣnudharmottara (II. 145. 15-16) and the Agnipurāna (233. 21–22) say that in their opinion the prāksta is really krtrima. Kām. VIII. 56 also speaks of only two, sahaja and krtrima, Although it is possible that the vijigiṣu's realm is surrounded by many kings, the one who is taken for discussion is the enemy and is to be regarded as in front (purastāt ) of the vijigiṣu. Therefore in front of the vijigisu come in order the ari ( imme diate neighbour ), then the mitra ( whose domain is next after that of the ari), then the arimitra (the friend of the enemy who will be immediately after the mitra of the vijigisu and so will be the enemy of the mitra), then comes the mitra mitra ( friend of the friend of the vijigiṣu) and then arimitra mitra (ally of the enemy's friend ).

to be in front of the vijigiṣu, the ruler of the territory in the opposite direction is said to be in the rear of the vijigisu (pascat) and is called pārṣnigrāha 292 (lit. one who may Beize or attack the heels). He is really an enemy but this special term is applied to him and he causes trouble in the realm of the vijigisu when the latter has started on an invasion or is about to start on one. The king who is the ruler of the country beyond the pārṣnigrāha is called ākranda (lit. one for whose help a cry is or may be raised by the vijigisu ). He would ordinarily be a friend being separated from the vijigiṣu by the realm of the pārsnigrāha. The friend of the pārenigrāha ( who would be immediately next after the akranda ) is called pārṣpigrāhāsāra and the friend of the ākranda who would be beyond the pārṣı nigrāhāsāra is called akrandāsāra. A madhyama 2% king is one whose realm is close to ( is on the border of) that of the vijigiṣu and that of the ari ( the immediate enemy in front) and who is capable of helping (or favouring ) both of them whether both are combined in alliance or not and who is capable of resisting either of them individually when the two are not in combina tion. An udasina king is generally defined as one whose territory is beyond or outside of the sphere of the realms of the vijigiṣu, his enemy in front and the madhyama, who is very strong on account of his elements of sovereignty, is capable of helping the above three kings whether they be in combination or not and who is capable of resisting any of the three when they are not in combination. Kullūka on Manu. VII. 153 differs from this explanation i.e. the udāsina is a powerful king whose realm may be situated in front or in the rear or even at a distance from that of the vijigiṣu, but he is indifferent for some reason or other to the activities of the vijigiṣu. The Mit. on Yāj. I. 345 observes that the udāsina also is of three kinds and the prāksta udāsına is the overlord of the State that is separated from the central state (vijigiṣu) by two intervening States; the

neutral in the the pakyāmrta 

madhyama ( or madhyastha acc. to Nitivākyāmṛta p. 318 ) is the immediate neighbour of both the vijigisu and his enemy, but wants to remain neutral in the conflict of the two for some reason. It will have been noticed that the vijigiṣu, the enemy, the madhyama and the udāsina are independent catagories, while four out of the remaining eight others viz. mitra, mitramitra, akranda, ākrandāsāra can be grouped under vijigiṣu, while the other four viz, arimitra, arimitramitra, pārṣpigrāha and pārṣpi grāhāsāra may be grouped under ari. It is therefore that Manu (VII. 155-156 ) speaks of the four prakstis (vijigisu, satru, madhyama and udāsīna ) as the mūla (basis) of the mandala theory and Kām. VIII. 20 informs us that Maya declared that a mandala was constituted by these four. Kām. VIII. 86 gives it as his own opinion that mandala is constituted by mitra, udāsīnu and ripu (enemy) only 294 Kautilya says that the man dala is constituted as explained above by twelve prakstis. Uśa nas was of the same opinion (Kām. VIII. 22) and Kām. (VIII. 41) states that there were numerous views about the number of the elements of the mandala, but a mandala of twelve kings is quite clear and well-known among all people 295. Kām. (VII). 20-41) explains how by various combinations of the elements of the mandala with some elements of sovereignty (viz. minis ters, rāstra, durga, kośa, bala) different writers held that the mandala comprised 18, 26, 54, 72, 108 and other numbers of prakrtis. The Sarasvativilāga (pp. 37-41) shows how from different standpoints Uśanas himself argued that the mandala was constituted by one praksti, two, three, 10, 21, 108 and that other writers speak also of 4, 5, 6, 14, 18, 30, 36, 44, 60, 72 prakrtis. All these figures are due to the inveterate habit of scholastic minds to run an idea to the earth and to indulge in divisions and sub-divisions.

Dasakumāracarita (VIII. p. 144) refers when speaking of the tree of naya that it has 72 prakstis as its leaves (dvigaptatipra kstipatraḥ ... nayavanaspatiḥ). The central idea of the man dala was to keep a balance of power among a circle of States, some being friendly among themselves owing to their position and surroundings, while others would form an antagonistic group. Kaut. (VI. 2) also refers to this number 72, out of which twelve are constituted by kings (rājaprakstis ) and 60 ( five sovereignty elements of each of the twelve ) are styled ( dravyaprakrtis). The śāntiparva (59.70–71) also refers to a mandala of 12 kings and to the number 72. Vide N. N. Law's 'Studies in Ancient Hindu Polity' pp. 195-208 for elucidation of the theory of mandala. The theory of mandala has this element of truth in it that on a calculation of probabilities the kings who are the immediate neighbours of a ruler are likely to be his enemies (at least potential) and the kings that are beyond the immediate neighbours may make common cause with the central State taken for discourse in order to crush between them a hostile intermediate State. It suggests that diplomacy may take the lines indicated by position and probabilities. The diagram below will247 illustrate the idea. Manu (VII.177 and 180) declares that (state) policy consists briefly in this that a king must so arrange all things or means that the ally, the udāsina and the satru cannot harm him or become superior to him. Medhātithi (on Manu VII. 177 ) remarks that even an ally may become an enemy if his interest so requires (svārthagativasācca mitramapyarirbhavati). 

Kautilya2% relates the theory of mandala to the theory of Saktis (already referred to on p. 171) and the six-fold policy (sadgunya).

The six guṇas 

223 

Everything secures success (i.e. his and his kingdom's happiness) according as the king is able to put forth each of the saktis to their utmost. The aspiring king taking into account his three Śaktis may employ the six gupas (methods of policy). The circle of the twelve States gives rise to the employment of the six methods. Differing from Vatavyādbi ( who said that there were only two methods, sandhi and vigraha ) and for once agreeing with the ācāryas, Kautilya accepts the position that there are six gunas and briefly defines them. The Sarasvativilāsa (p. 42 ) quotes a sutra of Gautama about the six guṇas, which is not found in the printed text. 299 Kautilya defines the six as follows: Sandhi 300 means making an arrangement or agreement; vigraha means taking up a hostile attitude; āsana means an attitude of indifference; yāna means preparing ( for attacking one's enemy); samsraya means taking shelter (with another powerful king); draidhibhāva means making peace with one king and adopting a hostile attitude to another. He then states that a king who is less strong than his neighbour may make an agreement with him, one who is rising in power may take up a hostile attitude, whoever thinks' the hostile king cannot hurt me nor can I hurt him' may remain indifferent (or neutral) in his own State, one who is endowed with all advantages may march against the enemy, whoever is devoid of strength should seek the protection (of a powerful ruler), and one should resort to a two-fold attitude when one's object can be accomplished by a friend. Some other works give more exact definitions and also define dvaidhībhāva somewbat differently, viz. dvaidhibhāva is dividing one's army into two parts. Vide Viṣoudharmottara301 II. 150.3-5 and Mit. on Yāj. I. 346. Some say that samsraya means seeking the protec tion of the udāsina or madhyama king. Kautilya (book VII) gives the most elaborate treatment of these six gunas and so do

Manu VII. 160 ff, Kām. IX-XVI, Viṣnudharmottara II. 145-150, Agnipurāṇa 240, Mānasollāsa pp. 94-116, Rājanitiprakāśa pp. 324-413. Only a few remarks are all that considerations of space allow. Manu (VII. 162-168 ) states that each of the gunas is of two sorts. Kām. LX. 2-18 and Agni 240 enumerate sixteen kinds of sandhis and Kām. defines them. His treatment is based on Kauṭ. VII. 3. Kauṭ. (VII. 3 ) says that when a weak king is attacked by a powerful king who is the leader in a circle of States, the former should at once gubmit and sue for peace on condition of offering his army, treasury, himself and his territory. Then he says that sandhis made on condition of offering the army are of three kinds viz. ātmāmiṣcı (lit. offering himself as the proy, which involves the condition that the king himself with a fixed number of troops or with the flower of his army would presert himself when called), atmaraksana ( saving himself, where the condition is that the commander-in-chief or the crown prince would present himself with an army), adssta puruṣa (lit. in which no person is definitely prescribed, where the agreement is that some one on the king's behalf or the king himself should march with the ariny to some place as required by the invader ). These sandhis are called dandopanata (lit. in which submission is made with the army ). Sandhis made on condition of offering the treasury (kosopanata ) are parikraya (lit. price, where by offering the treasury the other elements of rājya are kept free), upgraha ( where as much money is offered as can be carried on a man's shoulder ), kapāla (lit. broken half of a pot, where an immense amount of money has to be paid). Sandhis called lesopimata (submission with offer of territory ) are ūdista ( where a part of the realm is ceded and the rest saved from the invader), ucclunna ( where all the realm except the capital which has been deprived of all its wealth is offered ), apakraya where by offering the produce of the land the kingdoin is freed, paribhūṣaṇa where the agreement is to pay more than the produce of the land. Kām. adds some varieties and remarks (IX. 21-22 ) that upahāru (offering a present) is the only sandhi ( of which all the rest are varieties ) in his opinion, that only the maitra sandhi (alliance of friendship without the offer of land, money or anything else) does not come under upahāra 302 Kām. IX. 20 and Mānasollāsa ( II. 11.

pp. 94-95) speak of four sandhis, maitra, parasparopakūra ( agree ment to help each other ), sambandhaja (by offer of a princess in marriage ) and upahāra. An interesting example of a sandhi is furnished by the Lekhapañcāśikā which gives a form of treaty dated Monday, Full Moon of Vaiśākta in saivat 1288 (1232 A, D.) between Yādava king Singhaṇa of Devagiri who is styled mahārājādharaja and Lāvaṇyaprasāda (Lavapaprasāda) a Vaghela king who is styled rāṇaka and mahāmandalesvara, whereby the high contracting parties agreed not to invade each other's possessions, to combine and oppose anyone else who invaded one of them. Vide Bom. G, Vol. I part 1 p. 200 based on Bhandar kar's Report on the search for Mss. 1882-83 pp. 38-40. Kām. IX. 23-26 and Agnipurāṇa 240. 10-13 mention twenty kinds of persons with whom sandhi should not be made, Kam. (IX. 27-41 ) states the reasons why it should be so and in IX. 42-52 seven persons are enumerated with whom he recommends sandhi and gives reasons. A king should make sandhi even with one equal in strength ( not only with one who is more powerful ), since victory in battle is doubtful (Kām. IX. 59 ). 303 Kaut. uses a striking simile when he says that if one king comes in conflict with an equal they both will be destroyed in the same way as two unbaked earthen pots striking against one another. If a more powerful king rejects the proposal of a weaker king for sandhi, the latter should take up the attitude of offering his army or follow the course prescribed in book XII (ū baliyasam ). In VII. 12 when dealing with agreements between kings, about under takings to build forts or irrigational works or forests &c. Kaut. makes very interesting remarks about land routes being superior to water routes and about the route to the Deccan and the south being more profitable than the one leading to the Himā layas. 304 Kām. X. 15 ( = Agni 240. 19 ) says that vaira (hostile attitude ) is of five kinds viz. that of step-brothers, that due to land ( seizure of or encroachment on lands or houses ), due to woman ( carrying away one's wife or loving the same woman), due to words ( cutting speech ) and due to wrongs. Kām. X. 2-5

History of Dharmaśāstra 

(Vol. 

( = Agni. 240. 20-24) enlarges upon the 16 ways in which vigraha ( hostility ) springs, such as seizing the kingdom, wife, districts, vehicles (horses, elephants) and wealth of another, pride, harassment of subjects &o. When a king feels that his own army is well-nourished and pleased, that his subjects are prosperous and contented and that the army and subjects of another are the opposite of this, then he may adopt a hostile attitude and when he feels sure that he will secure one of the three fruits of hostility (viz, land, ally and wealth-Kām. X. 26-28). Kaut. VII. 15 deals with the attitude and conduct of a conquered king who has offered to the conqueror his army ( dandopanata-urtta ), while VII 16 speaks of the conduct of the dandopanāyi (an aspiring king who wants to make by means of his army another king submit to him). Yūna means marching for invasion on the part of a vijigișu whose army and prowess are of the highest and whose subjects are contented on account of his good qualities (Kānı. XI. 1). The Matsya 240.2 and the Agnipurāṇa ( 228. 1-2 ) add that when the enemy in the rear is overwhelmed by an ākranda, then the vijigiṣu should start on an invasion or when the enemy is plunged in calamities. But before actually invading the enemy who is yātavya ( chosen for attack ) an ambassador ( dūta ) should be sent ( Kām. XII. 1) to see whether the enemy will submit without fighting. That is, there was to be no war without negotiations and an ultimatum. In the Mahābhārata (Udyoga 83, 5-7) it is said that Krsna started as an envoy from the Pandavas to the Kauravas at the end of sarad (autumn) on the Revati nakṣatra in the month of Kārtika ( verse 7, Kaumude mūsi revatyām saradante himāgame). In the Purāṇas and the medieval digests elaborate rules are laid down about the religious and propitiatory ceremonies before starting on an invasion. The Visnudharmottara II. 176 and Agnipurāna 236, 1-18 require that for seven days before starting on an invasion the king is to engage in the worship of and make offerings to various gods, first to Ganapati, then to all the guardians of the quarters, the planets, Asvins, Visṇu and Siva and the images in the temples of his capital. Then he is to note what good and bad dreams he sees on those days in his sleep and judge accordingly. Vide Matsya 242, Agnipurāṇa 229 for dreams portending good and evil. This prognostication of good fortune from dreams is very ancient. The Chandogya Up. (V.2.8-9) quotes a verse to the effect that when a man is engaged in the performance of solemn sacrifices for securing some object and sees a woman in a dream he should feel that his rite will be

crowned with reward, Similarly the Ait. 305 Ār. III. 2. 4 men tions the signs of approaching death, one of which is to see in a dream a dark person with black teeth. Both these passages are quoted by Saṅkara in his bhāsya on Vedāntasūtra II. 1. 14. The Visnudharmottara II. 132-144 (based on Garga), IL 164, Matsya 228-241, Agni 230-23% are concerned with the portents and omens in the heavens, in the sky and on the earth and rites ( śāntis ) meant to avert the evil prognostications from them. The Mānasollāsa II. 13 pp. 97-112 and Rājanitiprakāśa pp. 331 351 also deal with these and other astrological matters, which are passed over here, though some of them are very interesting 8. g. Vispudharmottara II. 135. 1 refers to the weeping and dancing of images. On the 6th day from the time the rites begin which is the day previous to the starting of the invasion the king undergoes a ceremonial bath for victory called jayā. bhiṣoki. This is described at great length in the Rājanitiprakāga pp. 351-395 quoting extensive passages from the Lingapurāṇa. The ceremony of Jayasnānu resembles the coronation ceremony in many respects. The Matsyapurāṇa 243. 15-16 and the Viṣnudharmottara II. 163. 18-31 contain the same long list (with very slight variations) of articles, persons and animals the sight of which is auspicious when the king starts on an invasion and Matsya (243.2-14) contains another long list of inauspicious sights. A few of the auspicious ones are white flowers, jars full of water, cows, horses, elephants, fire in flames, a courtesan, durvā grags, gold, silver, copper, all gems, sword, umbrella, banner, corpse not accompanied by crying persons, fruits, the svastika sign. Among the inauspicious things and sights are dark grains, cotton, dried cowdung, fuel, jaggery, tonsured or naked man or man with dishevelled hair or wearing reddish robes, a lunatic, a cāndāla, a pregnant woman, broken pot, chaff, asbes, bones. The Mānasollāsa IL 13 verses 811-823 (pp. 102 103), Nitimayūkha pp. 58-59 also give long lists of inauspicious and auspicious sights or events. Matsya 213. 27 and Visnu dharmottara II. 163. 32 are both careful to add that all evil signs are counterbalanced by the confident (or joyous) frame of the mind, which is the highest sign of victory. 306 Gaut.

(XI. 15-17) prescribes that the king should heed the advice of astrologers and of those who are adepts in averting the effects of portents and perform the rites indicated by them such as grahaśānti, rites on auspicious days and of svastyayana, rites of black magic against his enemy &c. Kauṭ. IX, 7 ( at the end) says that the removal of divine calamities is brought about by the worship of deities and by honour to brāhmaṇas and by performing rites prescribed in the Atharvaveda. Manu VII 82 and Yaj. I, 315 state that gifts made to learned brāhmapas are an inexhaustible treasure for the king. The Rājadharmakanda (p. 109) quotes the Brahmapurāpa requiring the king to perform two Lakṣahomas every year and also a Kotihoma. The Raja dharmakānda (p. 113 ) and Rājanitiprakāśa (p. 144) quote Udyogaparva 33, 93-95 which set out eight indications of a man's approaching fall, viz, hating brāhmaṇas, opposing brāhmaṇas, depriving them of their wealth, desire to kill or harm them, taking pleasure in calumniating them, not liking their praise, not remembering them in religious acts and get ting angry when they make requests, 

It may be useful and interesting to see how in very ancient times the king was made ready for battle. The Asv. Gr. S (III. 12) says: when a battle is impending (the purohita) should make the king put on his armour (in the following way). The purohita should stand to the west of the chariot (of the king) muttering the hymn (Rg. X. 173) 'I have brought thee &c.'. He should hand over to the king his armour with Rg. VI. 75. 1 *when the man with armour advances it is like the appearance of the cloud &c.'. He hands over the bow with the next verse (Rg. VI. 75. 2 'dhanvanā gā). The purohita should make the king recite the next verse (Rg. VI. 75. 3) and should himself mutter the 4th verse (Rg. VI. 75. 4). He should hand over the quiver to the king with the 5th verse (Rg. VI. 75.5). When the chariot turns in the direction intended the purohita should mutter the sixth verse (Rg. VI. 75. 6). He should recite over the horses the 7th (Rg. VI. 75.7). He makes the king recite the 8th (Rg. VI. 75.8) when the latter looks at the arrows and makes the king recite Rg. VI. 75. 14 ('he envelopes his arm' &c.) when the latter fastens to his arm the leather (that pro tects his arm against the bow-string). When the king is being taken forward in the chariot by the charioteer the purohita ascends the chariot near the king and makes him recite the hymn called Abhivarta (Rg. X. 174) and the two verses (Rg. VIII. 101. 3-4). Then the priest looks at the king with

He should stand in that direction in which the Sun (by day) or Venus (by night) shines and give fight from that direction. The king should pass his hand over the drum with the three verses (Rg. VI. 47. 29-31 'fill with breath (or roar) the heaven and the earth'). The king should discharge arrows with Rg. VI. 75. 16 and the purohita should mutter Rg. VI. 75. 17 ('where the arrows fall together &c.) when soldiers are fighting, or the purohita may direct or teach (the king to recite from the above such verses as are appropriate to his actions ). 308 In the Harṣa carita (7th Ucchyāsa first paragraph) Bāṇa favours us with a realistic and graphic description of the preparations made when Harsa marched out from his palace on his digvijaya.

Br. 29.9 (where the sanparna hymn is mentioned ) gives an alternative explanation saying that the sauparna hymn referred to is the one declared in the grhyasutra viz. 'pra dhara yantu &c. ', i. e. he does not read 'pradharayantu' as in the printed Asv. Gr. ; on Ait. Br 37.7 (where the Abhivarta, Sāsa, Apratiratha and Sauparna hymns are mentioned) the comment of Sayana as printed reads ' pradhārayantu'.

This shows that the king desiring victory should not face the Sun or Venus (ओशनस) but should have them behind him and that he should not have the wind blowing in his face but blowing behind him. कालिदास in the कुमारसंभव III. 43 'खिमपातं परिहत्य तस्प काम: पुरा शुक्रमिष प्रयाणे| refers to this, on which मल्लिनाथ quotes a verse 'प्रतिशुक्र प्रतिबुध प्रत्यारकमेव च । अपि शक्रसमो राजा इतसैन्यो निवर्तते ॥.. The युक्तिकल्पतरु (ed. by N. N. Law) p. 176 says 'शस्तस्तु देवलमतेपनि पृष्ठतोऽकः' (verse 79). Oldenberg's translation (in S. B. E. vol. 29 p. 234) 'he should commence the battle in the line of battle invented by Aditya or Usadas' is wrong, as will be seen from the above quotations. Hopkins in J. A. O. S.

rising on the eastern horizon) indicative of his conquest of all the four quarters, Harsa was bathed in water poured from silver and golden jars, performed worship of Siva, offered oblations into fire that sent up flames turning from left to right, made gifts of jars full of sesame grains and of cows whose hoofs and horns were tipped with gold, sat on a throne on which tiger-skin was spread &c. 

When starting on an invasion the king was required to perform a rite called nīrājanāvidhi which consisted in waving lights before horses, elephants, banners, armies &c. 309 In II. 30 Kautilya 310 prescribes that on the 9th day of Aśvina lights should be waved before horses and at the beginning and close of invasions and in times of diseases. In II. 32 Kautilya speaks of the waving of lights before elephants thrice in the cāturmāsya (from about July to October) and at the time when two seasons meet. Kālidāsa in the Raghuvamsa 4.25 refers 311 to the per formance of this ceremony when Raghu started on his digvijaya and states ( in 17.13 ) that dūrvā grass, barley sprouts and the bark of the palasa tree were required in the Nirājanāyidhi, Kām. IV. 66 speaks of waving lights before horses and elephants ( nirajita-hayadvipaḥ). The Bṛhatsamhita, chap. 44 (verses 16-28 ) deals with the ceremony of waving lamps before horses, elephants and men. This ceremony had to be performed overy year in the month of Āśvina from the first to the 9th day of the bright half or on the 8th, 12th, or 15th of the bright half of Kārtika (acc. to the Bșhatsamhitā 44.2 ) by those who owned horses and also elephants. It is also described in the Saunaklya II. 8, Agni purāṇa 268, Vispudharmottara II. 159 ( quoted at length in the Rājaniti-prakāśa pp. 434-438 ), Kālikāpurāṇa 88-15 ff, Nirna yasindhu II. p. 169, Yuktikalpataru p. 178. The Bșhatsamhita describes it as follows In the north-east of the capital an ornamental arch of some holy tree was to be erected 10 cubits wide and 16 high.

Prajāpati, Indra and Visṇu were to be recited over the horses, during those days the horses were not to be harshly addressed nor struck with a whip and auspicious words were to be addressed to them, conches were to be blown, drums beaten and singing indulged in before them. On the 8th day, to the south of the arch a shed with its face to the north and covered with kusa grass and barks was to be erected and in front of it on a vedi fire was to be lighted and various materials and plants such as sandal-wood were to be collected and thrown into jars full of water, various foods were to be offered as bali, fuel sticks of khadira and other holy trees were to be brought. The king seated on a tiger-skin and facing the east should sit near the fire together with an astrologer and horse doctor and should follow at the direction of the purohita the procedure laid down for Grahayajña ( sacrifice to planets ) and the raising of Indra's banner. A horse and an elephant possessing the most auspici ous signs should be bathed and honoured with new white cloth, sandal-wood paste, garlands and incense and should be hrought to the foot of the arch near the shed with sweet words to the accompaniment of music and conch-blowing. The movements of the horse and elephant should be watched and prognostications made therefrom about victory &c. A ball of food over which mantras have been recited should be offered to the horse and if the latter smells it or eats it that is a sign of coming victory. Dipping an udumbara twig in the jars filled with water and plants the purohita should touch therewith the horse, the elephant, the king and his soldiers to the accompaniment of mantras. Then making an effigy of the enemy the purohita should pierce it with a sharp and pointed stave in the region of the heart with incantations from the Atharvaveda and break it. The purohita should pronounce over the bridle vedic mantras and insert it in the mouth of the horse, which the king should ride and proceed in the north-east together with his army, with drums beaten, concies blown and banners displayed. This is a propitiatory rite ( śānti) as said by Varāhamihira ( Brhat samhita 44.2) and the Agnipurāṇa 26.8 and 31 and must have been in vogue centuries before Kautilya flourished,

already been set forth above (p. 71). Conquests resulted in either loss of territory or more generally in the offering of tribute of various kinds to the conqueror viz. wealth ( gold and silver ), horges, elephants, pearls and gems, fine cloth &c. Particularly horses from Kamboja, Bālhika, Gāndhāra and other countries in the north and west were highly prized. Vide Sabhā 51.10, 53.5, Udyoga 86.6, Dropa 156. 47, Sauptika 13. 2; and Sabhā 27. 27, 28. 6 for horses as tribute. In Sabhā 30, 28-30 all the above kinds of tribute are said to have been levied from the Mleccha kings by Bhima 312 

Kautilya devotes one book (VIII) to the discussion of vyasanu. Vyasana 313 means' what deprives a man of great good' (from the root' as to throw with 'vi'). According to Kaut. vyasana may be either the absence of qualities (such as noble birth) or the opposite of such qualities, faults (such as hot temper ), excessive attachment (to women &c. ), harassment ( by invasion or calamities like famines ). So vyasanas may broadly be divided into two classes viz. calamities and faults due to kāma (passion ) and Krodha (hot temper). The view of many ūcāryas is that of the vyasanas of the king, ministers, the people of the realm, fort, treasury, army and ally, the vyasanas of each preceding one are more serious than those of each succeeding one. From the discussion in VIII. 1 it appears that Kautilya in this case agrees with the acāryas. Differing from Bhārdvāja Kaut, holds that the calamities befalling a king or his vices are more serious in their consequences than those of the ministers, since it is the king who appoints the ministers, the purohita, other servants and superintendents of departments and be can employ others in their places and since the rise or fall of the people depends upon him. Disagreeing with Viśālākṣa Kautilya holds that the vyasanas of ministers have more serious consequences than those of the people, as all (national) under takings proceed froin the ministers, as the security of person and property from internal and external enemies, adoption of remedies to resist calamities, recruiting of army, collection of taxes are all in their hands. Differing from the school of

Troubles of various kinds 

233 

Parāśara, Kautilya is of opinion that the vyasana of the people has graver consequences than that of the fort (or capital), for forts, treasury and army, all irrigation and agricultural work, stability, bravery and abundance (of things ) spring from the people. Against Piśuna, Kautilya states that the calamities befalling the fort (or capital) give rise to graver consequences than those of the army for the reason that it is in the fort that the treasury and army are kept safe. Kaut. (VIII. 2) holds that internal troubles are more serious than external ones and troubles due to ministers are the most serious of all internal troubles, Kaut. prefers an ignorant ruler ( who has not studied śāstras ) to a king who is bent on swerving from the dictates of sāstras which he knows; he prefers a king suffering from illness to a new king (a conqueror ), a weak but a high-born king to a strong but low-born one. In VIII. 3 he enumerates the several faults and vices which have already been stated above (p. 54 ). After remarking that ignorance and lack of training are the causes of vices or faults, Kaut. discourses on the relative seriousness of the several faults or vices and holds that gambling is worse than hunting, that sexual passion is worse than gambling, that drinking is worse than sexual vice and that gambling is the special cause of dissension among sanghas (corporate assemblies) and among families of nobles that have the characteristics of sanghas. In VIII. 4 he states that among divine visitations like fire, flood, epidemics and famine, floods are more devastating than fire, diseases and epidemics are less destructive than famine, that the loss of outstanding 314 men is more serious than that of common men even in large numbers, since there can hardly be one eminent man among a thousand ordinary or inferior men. He holds that the trouble caused by the Crown Prince is a lesser evil than that caused by a favourite queen. In VIII. 5 Kautilya holds a discussion on the troubles arising from the army and allies. He first enumerates thirty-three matters that may cause trouble with the army, such as not giving due respect to it, or showing contempt to it, not dispensing the pay at the proper time, not preventing diseases from attacking it, having soldiers who are very fond of their wives. He then takes pairs of troubles out of these and states which is the lesser evil of the two. Then he deals with causes that lead to the loss or defection of allies.

In the Rājadharmakāṇda, the Rājanitiprakāśa and other works the king is advised to celebrate several rites and festivals, which may be briefly referred to here. They were meant as propitiatory rites to avert national calamities and also to keep the populace in good humour and to afford enjoyment to people. The Rajadharmakānda (pp. 115-117 ) and the Rājanitiprakāśa (pp. 416-419 ) quote about 35 verses from the Brahmapurāṇa to the effect that the king is to celebrate in one or more of the six months from Vaiśākha festivals (devayātrā) in honour of various deities such as Brahmā, the gods, the Ganges, Vināyaka, Nāgas, Skanda, the Adityas, Indra and Rudra, the Mātrs ( Durgā and others ), the Earth, Viśvakarman, Viṣnu, Kamadeva, Siva, the Moon respectively on the tithis from the 1st to the 15th. The same two works quote a passage of 18 verses from the Skandapurāṇa about the festival of moonlight and also the rite of raising the banner of Indra and the latter quotes (pp. 425-433) a long passage from the Viṣnudharmottarapurāṇa also. Vide H. of Dh. vol. II pp. 825–26 for description of the festival of Indra's banner. They describe the worship of Devi on the 8th and 9th days of Asvina ( from the Devipurāṇa ) when animals were sacrificed, the gifts of cows on the Amāvābyā of Kārtika, the rite called Vasordhārā ( stream of wealth). The details of all these are passed over here for want of space. 

## 10 Purpose of the Study of Rājadharma

CHAPTER X 

PURPOSE OF THE STUDY OF RĀJADHARMA 

AND THE ENDS OF THE STATE 

In the preceding pages an attempt has been made to present a picture of the theory and practice of Government and state craft as delineated by ancient and medieval Indian writers on dharmaśāstra and arthaśāstra. One feature that would strike any reader is the religious colouring with which all theories and ideals are suffused. Another is that the ideal set before rulers and their officers is a highly moral one. Several faults have been found in the theory and practice inculcated by the writers. Except for some centuries before and after the Christian era, monarchy has been the only form of government known in India 

and monarchy alone is generally envisaged by Indian writers. The result has been that the king came in practice to be almost synonymous with government and the State, though a very lofty sense of his duties and responsibilities was impressed on the king. Another defect lies in the almost total absence of discussion on the form and working of oligarchical or republican States. Besides, once the main outlines of the theory of the State were established by the first writers on polity, for about two thousand years succeeding generations of authors were content to follow in the old grooves and hardly ever made any fresh approach to the problems of government or started any rival conceptions or theories. Ancient authors were content to induce the kings and the people to support as far as possible the status quo. They thus provided for a more or less static society and did not encourage any dynamic thoughts or movements. There was no strong or assertive middle class nor was there any organized Church. Though the brāhmaṇas were a sacred class, they were not organized as a body and had to depend only on exhortations and texts to exert influence on the monarchs. It may no doubt be pointed out that similar conditions prevailed almost all the world over. Small States, constant wars and invasions were the commonest phenomena in Europe till the 15th or 16th century and no reproach should be levelled at the Indian writers alone. It cannot, however, be gainsaid that even after experi encing the constant plundering expeditions and religious persecutions of Scythian, Hun and Moslem invaders from the

1st to the 11th and the following centuries the able thinkers, warriors and statesmen of India did not enlarge their limited horizon and find means to consolidate and weld together into a united block the numerous small States that were scattered all over India. They could have put forward a common idea and ideal before all the provinces and peoples of India viz. meeting the onslaught of plundering and fanatical invaders, which, if pro perly handled, would have acted as a unifying force. It was to some extent only in Vijayānagara and Mahārāṣtra that in medieval times means were adopted to weaken the power of the invader, to present a solid front and establish powerful Hindu kingdoms. The old writers spun the same old webs of theories that had been there for centuries, they did not formulate new theories nor did they take steps to infuse into the common people a sense of solidarity and unity as Indians and did not inculcate deep and abiding sentiments of patriotism similar to those we find in Western countries for the last two or three hundred years. In spite of such drawbacks it will have to be conceded that ancient Indian writers made substantial and independent contributions to the theory and practice of Government and that their handiwork can stand comparison with the ancient and medieval thought of most countries of the world, 

· It may be asked: What in these days is the use of the study of the theory and practice of Government in ancient India ? It may be argued that the world is now hoping, as promised by the great leaders of the United Nations, to enjoy several free doms, that great expectations are created in the minds of millions of down-trodden peoples, and that all peoples including Indians will be faced in the near future with democracy and great problems of reconstruction and that knowledge of the past cannot throw much light on the pressing needs of the present or the serious questions that will confront all in the latter half of the 20th century. It may be conceded that the situation in which we find ourselves now and in which we shall be placed in the near future is unique and much light cannot be thrown by a study of the past on the solution of the problems that will have to be tackled by us. But that study has certain useful purposes to serve. Millions of people in India as well as in the world are hardly better than hewers of wood and drawers of water in their own countries. They intensely desire to be masters in their own countries and of their own destinies. The iron has entered

deep in their souls that for countries as well as individuals freedom of action spells happiness and dependence on the will of others is misery (as Manu laconically puts in IV. 160 ), that men who have no independence are hardly human beings ( as the Mārkandeya 125-29 says ).315 The study of the past will give us hope and convey the assurance that we have in the past conducted governments and administrations of vast empires, that we evolved theories and practices which were not inferior to those of some of the most advanced nations of the world, that, allowed opportunities and scope, we may rise equal to what the circumstances may demand of us. On the other hand, such a study will stimulate thought, focus our attention on our mistakes and short-comings, make us be careful to avoid pitfalls and give us indications of the directions in which we must make a new orientation in our ideals and practices. 

At the end of this section on Rājadharma, a question may be asked: what were the ends or purposes that the State in ancient India placed before itself or the dharmaśāstra and arthaśāstra writers said the State should place before itself? The end of the State has been differently stated by different philosophers and theorists of the West from ancient times to the present day. To take only a few examples. To Plato and Aristotle 316 the end of the State was good life for the citizens. But it is not very easy to say what is meant by the good life. Bluntschli in Theory of the State' ( Oxford, 1885 ) Book. V Chap. IV p. 300 formulates the proper and direct end of the State to be 'the development of the national capacities, the perfection of the national life and finally its completion', provided, of course, that the process of moral and political development shall not be opposed to the destiny of humanity. This definition is not easy to grasp. There is no agreement as to what is the destiny of humanity and the concepts of nation and national life are hardly older than a few centuries even in Europe. For ' nation' one may substitute the word ' country'

316, Aristotle in 'Politics' says 'A state exists for the sake of a good life and not for the sake of life only ... Political society exists for the sake of noble actions and not of mere companionship' (Book III, Chap. 9).

[Vol. 

or 'kingdom'. Then it may be of some application to India. It is impossible to define the end of the State in a single word or in a few words. This question about the end of the State has been partly answered already when speaking of the ideals of kingship. At the risk of some repetition a reply to the above question may be given in the following words. The authors on Dharmaśāstra had a very low estimate of human nature, they believed that ordinarily men were deprayed, that it was difficult to find a man pure by nature and that men were kept in the straight path by the fear of punishment ( Manu VII. 22 = Sānti 3166 15. 34). Yāj. I. 361 requires the king to punish and bring to the proper path castes and guilds when they swerve from their dharma. Kām. (II. 40 and 42-43 ) says the same thing and adds that in the absence of danda the world will revert to the state of mātsya-nyāya ( the strong devouring the weak). Sukra I. 23 says the same thing. The ancient writers did not rely on the natural moral impulses of man and on his will to do the right thing. The same ideas are expressed by some Western writers on law and politics. “A herd of wolves is quieter and more at one than so many men, unless they all had one reason in them or have one power over them' says Jeremy Taylor. Salmond (Jurisprudence p. 65 ) states 'man is by nature a fighting animal and force is the ultima ratio not of kings alone but of all mankind'. We must distinguish between immediate or proximate ends and the ultimate end. The ultimate end or goal of most of our philosophy was mokṣa (release or liberation from the ever-recurring cycle of births and deaths and from the miseries and suffering of life). The same was the ultimate goal of rajadharma. But the proximate goal of the State in India was to create such conditions and

environments as would enable all men to live in peace and happiness, to pursue their avocations, to follow their own customs and usages and their "svadharma', to enjoy without interference the fruits of their labour and the property acquired by them. The king was the divinely provided instrument to create the conditions of peace, order and happiness. If the king impartially exercises the power of danda over all, whether his own son or enemy, in proportion to their guilt, he secures this world and the next for himself and the people; the king's scrupulous performance of his own duties leads him and his people to heaven. The task of the State (or the king who represent ed the State ) was to repress by the threat and use of force any violation of the rights of personal freedom and property, to enforce the practice of people's own traditional customs and usages and to take serious care of virtues and dharma. These were the sentiments of Kautilya himself ( III. 1. ).316 At the very threshold of his work he remarks therefore the king should not allow people to swerve from or fail in their duties (dharma); for whoever holds fast by his dharma, observes the rules laid down for āryas and those of castes and aśramas ( the stages of life ) will be happy in this world and the next. The members of society consisting of four castes and having four āśramas when guarded by the king with danda will abide by their respective paths, being devoted adherents of their respective duties and avocations'. 

Both Kām. I. 13 and Sukra I. 67 state : 17 that a king following the path of righteousness confers upon himself and his subjects the group of three viz. the three puruṣārthas of dharma, artha and kāma; if he acts otherwise he certainly ruins (himself and the people). The same doctrine is inculcated by other works, such as Sānti 85. %, Mārkandeya 27.29-30.318

(Vol. 

Therefore what the king was to do was to see that the dharmas of varna and aśramu were observed by the people and if they swerved from them to bring them back by punishments. Sukra IV. 4. 39 says that each caste was to observe the rules of the caste handed down from generation to generation and that if its members behaved otherwise they were liable to be punished by the king. The principal works emphasize that each individual in the State should fulfil his own duties ( svadharma) as belong ing to a particular class (varna) or a particular stage of life (aśrama) or his own duties due to the position he occupies and those known as sāmānya dharma such as ahimsā, truthfulness &o. (for which see H. of Dh. vol. II. pp. 10-11) and that the purpose of the State was to enable him to do so and to prevent others from interfering with him. All this laid undue emphasis on the preservation of the status quo, on current beliefs and practices as the ideal. The writers do not emphasize that each individual must actively pursue the good of the society as a whole. As the final goal was mokṣa, undue emphasis was laid on other-worldiness, on individual attainment and on detachment and running away from ordinary worldly affairs. The goal of the State was deemed to be to enable men to attain the four puruṣārthas, particularly the first three ( as the last viz. mokṣa depended only upon individual philosophical insight and mystical experience and was attainable only by a microscopic number). Even the Bārhaspatya-sūtra 1! ( II. 43) says that the fruit of polity was the attainment of dharma, artha and kama. Soma deva begins his Nitivākyāmsta in a characteristic way when he performs obeisance to rājya (the State) that yields the three fruits of dharma, artha and kāma, 320 Kām.321 IV.77 winds up his discussion of the seven elements of rājya with the declara tion that the entire State depends for its highest stability on wealth and the army and that the State when handled by a sagacious minister results in securing the three goals. Kautilya322 (in I. 7) first advises people not to eschew pleasures altogether,

but to enjoy pleasures in such a way as not to conflict with the requirements of dharma and artha, and adds that a man may enjoy in an equal degree the three guals of life that are dependent on each other, since any one of the three if pursued to excess harms not only the other two but also itself. The Dharma gāstra authors held that Dharma was the supreme power in the State and was above the king, who was only the instrument to realize the goal of dharma. To these authors the State was not an end in itself but only a means to an end. Kautilya, true to his position as a writer on arthaśāstra, finally states his opinion that artha is the chief among the three goals, as the other two depend upon wealth for their realization. With this statement of Kautilya, one of the most renowned figures of Indian anti quity, this section on rājadharma may be appropriately brought to a close.
