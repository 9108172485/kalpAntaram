SECTION 1 VRATAS (Religious Vows) and UTSAVAS (Religious Festivals) 

CHAPTER I VRATA IN THE RGVEDA 

Vrata is one of many Sanskrit words, the use and history of which extend over several thousand years. The derivation and semantic development of the word vrata have been the subject of great controversies. These questions have been dealt with by me at some length in the JBBRAS, vol. 29 (1954) pp. 1-28. I shall here summarise the discussion contained therein. 

In the great St. Petersburg Dictionary the word vrata is derived from the root vṛ' (to choose) and the important senses of the word given in that Dictionary are: (1) will, command, law, prescribed order; (2) subservience, obedience, service; (3) domain; (4) order, regulated succession, realm; (5) calling, office, custom ary activity, carrying on, custom; (6) religious duty, worship, obligation; (7) any undertaking, religious or ascetic performance or observance, Vow, sacred work; (8) vow in general, fixed purpose; (9) other specialized senses. Max Muller derived it from vr 'to protect' and held that it meant originally what is enclosed, protected, set apart, then what is settled or determined, law, ordinance and then 'sway or power'. Whitney, in a note on this word in the Proceedings published in J. A. O. S. vol. XI pp. 29-31, after setting out the treatment of the word in the St. Petersburg Dictionary, brushed aside Max Mullor's etymology as unsatisfactory and as possessing little plausibility and declared that he did not accept the derivation of the word from vr 'to choose', that 'vr' did not signify willing or command, but only choice or preference, though he admitted that there is a relation ship between 'choose' and 'command'. He objected that'ta' 23 an affix (except in the formation of past passive participles) was very rare and that the only analogous word he could think of would be 'marta' from ‘mp' to die. He preferred to derive the word from 'vrt' 'to proceed' and, though he admitted that the form yrata from 'yit' with affix a would be exceptional, he thought that the words 'vraja' and 'trada' supported the deriva tion and put forward the ground that the word 'vrata' occurs 

History of Dharmaśāstra 

(Sec. 1, Ch. I 

frequently in the Rgveda with verbs of motion such as 'car', *sa$c' or 'sac'. 

Prof. V. M. Apte contributed a long article on vrata to the 3rd volume of the Bulletin of the Deccan College Research Institute at Poona (pp. 407-488). Prof. Apte agreed with Whitney in deriving the word vrata from yt', boldly asserted that the derivation of the word from 'vr' to choose or 'vr' to guard or enclose is impossible (p. 410), that there is not a single vrata passage in the Rgveda which favours the meaning 'will, command, obedience or fixed purpose', that 'vṛt' not only means 'to proceed' (as Whitney holds) but also 'to turn, to turn oneself, turn round, revolve, move on' and that therefore 'vrata' means not only procedure, course of action, conduct, but also 'circular movement and then 'route or circular path' (pp. 411-412). 

My own view is that both Whitney and Prof. Apte are wrong in deriving the word vrata from 'vrt'. I further hold that passages in which 'vst' occurs with upasargas such as abhi, ā, ni, pari, pra or vi, would not be helpful in determining the original meaning of 'vrt' by itself, since upasargas often totally change the meaning of the root", that it is doubtful whether the root'vit' standing by itself means in the Rgveda 'to proceed' (as Whitney thought) and I deny that 'yṛt' occurring by itself without upasargas in the Rgveda ever means 'to turn round, move on' (as Prof. Apte asserts). In my opinion the root 'yst' by itself (and not used in a causal or frequentative sense) means simply to be, to remain, to abide' Occurrences of the root vrt' without any upasarga before or after it are few in the Rgveda. Some typical examples may be given. "When, O Indra, thou didst strike down the wiles of Svarbhānu (the demon Rāhu) that remained below the sky2' (Rg. V. 40.6); "the wheel does not affect (jolt) your chariot (O Ašvins!) that is followed by songs one after another and that remains possessed of food' (Rg. VIII. 5. 34); "they (the dice) remain downwards (lie down on the board or ground) but they throb or strike above (i. e. they shake or terrify the hearts of gamblers ); though they have no hands yet they defeat those that are endowed with hands' (Rg. X. 34. 9). Vide also Rg. X. 27.19, X. 107. 11 for other verses where 'vrt'

Meaning of Vrata 

occurs without an upasarga and means 'to remain or abide'. Even with an upasarga like 'sam' vrt means simply 'to be or to abide' and not 'revolve or turn' or 'move on'. Vide Rg. VI. 41.2, X. 90. 14, X. 121. 1 and 7, X. 129.4, in which 'sam-vartatām' or 'samavartata' simply means 'let it remain' or 'it was or existed'. Simply because 'vrt' with "abhi' means 'to turn towards or attack' (as in Rg. IV. 43.5 or V.31.5) or with 'ni' means 'come down or return' (as in Rg. X. 19. 1, 3, 5, X. 95.17) or with 'pari' means 'roam over or round' (as in Rg. I. 164. 11 and IV. 36.1), or with pra' means 'to proceed'(as in Rg. V. 30.8 or X. 89.12 ), or with vi means 'roll or revolve' (as in Rg. I. 185. 1, V. 30. 8, V. 53.7, VI. 9.1) it does not at all follow that the original sense of vrt' is, as Prof. Apte asserts (p. 411 end), 'to revolve or roll on'. Besides, the last two senses are somewhat contradictory. 

Prof. Apte complains that scholars were content as to vrata with the meanings 'law, statute, command, sacrifice, vow, fixed purpose, duty' and did not take enough notice of the important part that the sense of 'route or circular path' plays in the Rgveda. Ho opines that the divine vratas often mentioned in the Rgveda rather mean 'the heavenly routes, the divine rounds, the periodi cal movements round the sky closely adhered to by the gods themselves' rather than 'holy laws' laid down by a particular deity. Adopting a suggestion of Tilak in 'Orion' (p. 154) that the path of sta sometimes mentioned in the Rgveda is the broad belt of the Zodiac which the luminaries never transgress, Prof. Apte sets out to prove that the word 'sta' in the Rgveda primarily means the belt of the Zodiac (vide his paper in the Silver Jubilee volume of the Annals of the B. O. R. I, pp. 55-56). This theory has failed to appeal to eminent Vedic scholars. In my humble way I endeavoured to show in the 4th vol. of the H. of Dh. (pp.2-5) that 'sta' has three senses in the Rgveda, one of which is the course of nature or the regular general order in the cosmos'. 'The path by which the group of Adityas reaches sta' in Rg. 1. 41. 43 or the statement in Rg. 1. 164. 11 'the wheel of sta, that has twelve spokes (12 constellations or months), continually goes round the sky without being worn out' are only illustrations of the first meaning of rta. But this meaning of sta by itself shods hardly any light on the meaning of vrata. Rta and vrata are

(Sec. I, Ch. I 

not synonyms and it is difficult to see how, conceding for argu ment that 'sta' is the belt of the Zodiac, vrata means, as Prof. Apte obviously thinks, the same thing. Řta is an Indo-European word but so far as I know 'vrata' is not even shown to be Indo Iranian, much less Indo-European. 

Prof. Apte advances the theory that there are two parallel phases of the semantic evolution of the word 'vrata' viz. a 'divine phase' and a 'human' phase. I feel no hesitation in denying the existence of any such distinction in the meaning of the word 'vrata'. Prof. Apte arranges (pp. 414-415) the so-called divine phase of the meaning of vrata into six groups, viz. (1) turning round, passage, procedure, physical activity, (II) circular path, settled or beaten route, (III) sphere or region of movement or influence, (IV) routine, laws of movement; periodic appearance or visit, customary activity, recurring march, (V) victorious advance or strength, (VI) ordinance, law, rule or code of conduct. In the so-called 'human phase of semantic development he sets out four groups of senses, viz. (1) physical activity (as disting uished from mental), duty, profession; (II) the sum total of those peculiar ethical and religious duties and practices which made up the culture pattern of the Aryans; (III) the specific social and religious duties of the three classes of Aryan society ; (IV) devo tion to duty in general on the part of men and women. 

I have summarised Prof. Apte's long list of meanings in ten groups. The very fact that Prof. Apte had to marshall over sixty English equivalents for the meaning of the word 'vrata', which occurs in the Rgveda only about 220 times by itself or in com bination with other words is enough to make scholars suspicious about the correctness of the entire scheme. Though he had the hardihood to assert in one place (p. 410)4 that no passage in the Rgveda favours the meaning 'will or command he admits (on pp. 476-477) that in three passages (Rg. II. 38.7, X. 10.5, X. 33.9) the meaning of vrata as 'ordinances laid down by a divinity for devotees or human beings' is quite acceptable to him and further that in about 25 passages (which come under groups II to IV of the so-called human phase of Prof. Apte) vrata either means 'ethical or religious code of practices of the three classes of Aryans' or 'beneficent sway or devotion'. 

4. Hereafter up to aote 23 wherever only pages are mentioned and Do work, the reference is to the pages of the 3rd vol. of the Bulletin of the Deccan College Research Institute,Derivation of Vrata 

I shall now state my own views on the derivation and the meanings of the word vrata in the Rgveda. I derive the word from the root 'vr' (to choose). From this root comes the word 'vara' (bridegroom who is chosen from among several men by a maiden or her guardian), which occurs in æg. IX. 101. 14 and 

X. 85. 8 and 9. Choosing involves willing or volition on the part of the person choosing. Hence 'vr' also means 'to will'. Therefore, when the word vrata is derived from 'vr' with the suffix 'ta', the meaning of vrata can be 'what is willed' or simply 'will. The will of a person in power or authority is a command or law unto others. Devotees believe that gods have laid down certain commands to be followed by themselves as well as by all beings. Thus comes the sense of 'law or ordinance'. A command of a superior imposes and implies a corresponding duty to obey. When commands are obeyed or duties are performed in the same way for long, they become the patterns of obligations i. e. cus toms or practices. When persons believe or feel that they must perform certain acts as ordained by gods, then arises the sense of religious worship or duty. If a man imposes upon himself certain restrictions as to his behaviour or food to win the favour of gods that becomes a sacred vow or religious observance. Thus the several meanings of the word 'vrata', which I derive from the root'vr', are command or law, obedience or duty, religious or moral practices, religious worship or observance, sacred or solemn Vow or undertaking, then any vow or pattern of conduct. It should not be supposed that these several meanings followed one another in a time sequence. Two or more meanings might have been simultaneously in vogue such as 'ordinance, duty or obedience'. These meanings of vrata set out by me are quite sufficient for the interpretation of almost all Rgveda passages in which the word occurs. 

When Whitney derived the word 'vrata' from 'vrt' with affix 'a', he could cite only two words 'vraja' and 'trada' as parallel. But it is quite possible to argue that ‘vraja' is not analogous to vrata (if derived from 'vṛt). Vraja (cowpen) occurs in the Rgveda in II. 38. 8, IV. 1. 15, IV. 16. 6, V. 6. 7, V. 33. 10, can vory well be derived from 'vraj' to go and Pāpini III. 3. 119 appears to derives it from 'vraj' in the sense of 'karaṇa' or adhikarama. The root 'vraj' occurs in the Rgveda. If vraja is derived from

(Sec. 1, Ch. I 

the root 'vraj, it is not on all fours with vrata derived from 'vrt'. Whitney probably derived 'vraja' from 'vrj. But the meaning of 'vraja' (cowpen) can hardly arise from the root ‘vȚj' (to give up, abandon). The word 'trada' occurs only once in the Rgveda (VIII. 45. 28)) and is applied to Indra. It is difficult to say from what root, if any, it is derived. Whitney probably derived it from 'trd' to injure or pierce. The word 'trdilāḥ' (crushing) is applied to the stones (grāvāpaḥ) which crush soma stalks (Rg. X. 94. 11). Whitney says he knows only one word 'marta' derived from 'mr' (to die) with the affix 'ta' which is analogous to vrata if the latter be derived from 'vr'. But Whitney failed to notice other words with the affix 'ta' (not past passive partici ples) such as ‘karta' (deep hole, cavern) (in Rg. 1. 121.13, II. 29.6, IX. 73. 8 and 9) and 'garta' (cavity or seat in a war chariot) (in Rg. II. 33. 11, V. 62. 5 and 8, VI. 20. 9, VII. 64. 4), vāta (wind) from 'vā' (Rg. V. 31. 10, X. 168.1 &c.), dhūrta and several others. 

Prof. Apte cites the word vartani (which means 'way' in Rg. I. 23. 9, V. 61. 9, VII. 8. 16, VIII. 23. 19, VIII. 63. 8) as analog ous to vrata (from vrt). But that word lends very little help. In 'vartani' there is guņa (vrt becomes vart); besides vartani cannot be derived from ‘vrt' meaning turn round or revolve' (which Prof. Apte gives as the original meaning), but from the meaning 'to abide' or at the most 'to proceed' and further 'vartani' has practically only one meaning in the Rgveda, while vrata has to be paraphrased by sixty different words in English by Prof. Apte. 

Prof. Apte following Whitney relies on the fact (p. 409) that vrata is frequently employed in the Rgveda with verbs of motion such as anu-i, anu-car, anu-gā, anu-vrt. But these roots take on another meaning (viz. 'to follow or observe') owing to the presence of 'anu' and in almost all the passages where the forms of these roots with anu occur there is no indication whatever of physical motion, but only that of 'obeying or observing'. Besides, the root car' itself is not used in the sense of physical motion in several passages of the Rgveda, but in the sense of performing' and

Meaning of Vrata 

'observing'. Video Rg. I. 52. 6, III. 54. 2, VI 9.6, VII. 89.5. Moreover, in words like brahmacāri (Rg. X. 109.5) and vratacārinah (Rg. VII. 103. 1) the meaning of a physical motion, if it was the original one at all, is totally absent and the mean ing 'performing' or 'observing' is the only one possible. Some occurrences of the roots 'saśc' and 'sac' in which the meaning of physical motion is inapplicable but the meaning 'resort to, accept or be united to appears to be intended are found in Rg. II. 1. 13, VII, 28.4 (for forms of 'saśc') and IV. 12. %., VII. 85.5, VIII, 4. 9, IX, 95.4 (for forms of 'sac'). 

It is now necessary to examine the contention of Prof. Apte that vrata means in the Rgveda the tracks or routes that the various luminaries trace in the heavens. Vratas are spoken of not only in relation to Agni, Indra, Mitra, Soma, Uşas, Savit; and Adityas but also in relation to Varupa (in Rg. I. 25.1, III. 54. 18, V. 69.4, VII. 83.9), Brhaspati (in II. 23. 6), Indra and Brahmapaspati (II. 24. 12), Aditi (I. 144. 12, VII. 87.9), Parjanya (V.83.5) and Aśvins (I. 183.3). Conceding for a moment that by some stretch of imagination or some linguistic acrobatics one can speak of the vratas of Agni, Adityas, Mitra, Indra, Savit; and Uşas as referring to the tracks of luminaries in the heavens, the mid regions and on the earth, one should like to know whether Aditi, Asvins, Varupa, Bșhaspati or Brahmapaspati aro luminaries and what tracks they were supposed to trace in the heavens or elsewhere. Scholars are not agreed as to the meaning of Aditi or as to the physical or celestial phenomena Varuņa or the Aśvins were supposed to represent. Aditi is a riddle, being identified with the heaven and the mid regions and also spoken of as the father, mother or the son or as the mother of Daksa and also his daughter ; vide Rg. 1. 89. 10, 11. 27.1, X. 72. 4-5 and Nirukta XI. 23 as to Aditi and Rg. II. 1. 11 where Agni is identified with Aditi. Long before the times of the Nirukta there was difference on the question of the nature of Asvins, some identifying them with Heaven and Earth, or day and night, or the Sun and the Moon or two meritorious kings (Nirukta XII. 1), while some Western scholars hold them to be the Morning and the Evening star or Castor and Pollux. The endeavour of interpreters of the Rgveda should be to assiga such

History of Dharmaśāstra 

(Sec. I, Ch. I 

a derivation and meaning to the word vrata as would be appro priate in all cases where the word vrata is brought in relation to some gods. In my opinion the only meanings that can be well construed with all passages in which the yratas of the several gods mentioned above are referred to is 'commands or ordin ances, religious or moral practices or worship or vows. One does not understand what Prof. Apte means when he remarks at (p. 442) in a tone of ridicule that observing or obeying the 'ordin ances or religious worship of gods' is a soft job and looking after the paths or the tracks of luminaries is a strenuous one. If anything, the reverse of this should be true. 

The word 'samrāj' appears to be applied to a human king in Rg.10 VII. 58. 4 'the sovereign, protected by you, O Maruts! kills the enemy', and in Rg. X. 85.46 the newly married girl has the blessing 'be you a queen' (samrājñī). Varuņa, Mitra, Indra, Agni, Višve-devāḥ and Adityas are called kings (rājan) and emperors (samrāj) in Rg. II. 41.6, III. 10.1, III. 54. 10, V. 85. 1, VII. 38. 4, VIII. 27. 22, X. 63. 5. Varupa (who is praised in about 12 hymns) is called samrāj oftener than even Indra praised in about 200 hymns. What is more natural than to suppose that the gods called kings and emperors were believed to have laid down commands or ordinances to be obeyed by all. Though Rgvedic sages extol several gods they had already arrived at the conception that there was only one Supreme Being that was addressed under different names such as Indra, Mitra, Varuna, Agni and assumed several forms (Rg. I, 164. 46, VI. 47. 18, X. 121. 1, X. 129. 1-2). Vratas are spoken of as dhruva (immutably fixed) as in 11. 5. 4, III. 56. 1, V. 69. 4 and as adabdha (unharmed, unassailable) as in 1. 24. 10, 11. 9. 1, 111.54.18, VII. 66. 6 and dailya (divine) as in Rg. 1.70.1, 1. 92. 12, VII.75.3. One must carefully remember these facts when ascertaining the exact meaning of vrata mentioned in connection with almost all the prominent gods of the Rgveda. It is often stated in the Rgveda that the vratas of the god whom the sage for the moment praises are not violated by other gods. Some striking examples11

may, be given here : Rg. III. 7. 7 'the gods observe the yratas of gods' (devā devānām-anu hi vratā gub); II. 38. 9 'I invoke for my welfare with salutations god Savits whose vrata is not violated by Indra, Varupa, Mitra, Aryaman, or Rudra or by the (god's) enemies'; III, 56. 1 'the primaval and immutably fixed vratas are not destroyed by the wily (demons), nor by the wise (sages), nor by the well-disposed Heaven and Earth and the firmly fixed mount ains are not there for being bent down'; VIII. 42. 1 'the all-know ing and powerful (Varuņa) made Heaven firm, he measured (created) the expanse of the earth; the great king sits over (rules) all the worlds; all these are the yratas of Varuna'. Vide also Rg. 1, 101.3, 11. 24. 12, II. 38. 2, III, 30. 4, V. 69. 4. 

The above mentioned passages clearly show that the Vedic sages believed that not only did the several gods observe or carry out the immutably fixed ordinances laid down by themselves or by any one of them but that even wily demons had to observe them and that waters or rivers flow as ordained by gods. We have to take into account along with these beliefs that the Rgveda often adverts to the fact that human beings also break (or violate) the vratas of gods, are liable to be punished therefor and pray to the gods to pity them and to withhold the punishment. For example, 12 Rg. I. 25.1-2 'Whatever ordinance (vrata) of thine, O Varuna! we may break day to day as people (subjects) do (i. e. break the king's law) do not reduce us to death &c.'; X. 25. 3 'O Somal if I transgress your perfect (lit. well-baked) vratas, then in thy exhilaration (at our sacrifices) take pity on us as a father does towards his son'. Vide also VII. 89.5, VIII. 48. 9. 

(Continued from last page) TOUT TAIGI VIII. 42 1; the word vrata occurs five times in II. 38 (verses 2, 3, 6, 7, 9) and should be construed according to the general rules of inter pretation in the same sense in all verses of the same hymn at least. Prof. Apte admits (on p. 476) that the meaning 'ordinances' would be appropriate ja Rg. II. 38, 7 ( 

A TT ara aral F4 HORA ) and accepts that meaning in that verse, but on II. 38. 9 (p. 468) his obsession about the original meaning being 'tracks' leads bim to say "that in that verse the word vrata means 'Savitr's fixed movements in the heavens." ___12. यञ्चिद्धि ते विशो यथा म देव वरुण व्रतं मिनीमास विद्यवि। मा नो बधाय हरनवे ATEISTarfa :1 .

(Sec. I, Ch. I 

It would have been noticed that in some of the passages quoted above (in note 11) on vrata, verbal forms of the root 'mi' or 'mi' occur. For the correct understanding of these passages the exact meaning of the root 'mi' is very important. The Nighantu (II. 19) includes 'mināti'among verbs meaning ‘vadha' (killing or harming). In the Dhātupātha the meaning of the root ‘mi' is hiṁsā' (killing, annihilating, breaking). Vide Pāṇini VII. 3, 81. (mināter-nigamo). The forms of 'mi' or 'mi' with or without the preposition 'a' or 'pra' occur more than 50 times in the Rgveda and often in connection with vrata. Whitney felt that the occurrences of the forms of 'mi' or 'mi' presented some difficulty about his theory of the derivation of vrata and its meanings, but Prof. Apte, who derived his inspiration from Whitney, feels no such misgivings as Whitney felt, holds, relying on his own interpretation of Rg. I. 124. 3, that 'mi' or 'mi' is a verb of motion and has the primary sense of 'miss, deviate, wander or stray from' (p. 411). Over a dozen verses at least will clearly show that Prof. Apte has been led astray by his preconceived theory about vrata meaning 'tracks of luminaries' and that 'mi' or 'ml' cannot at all be construed in the sense of 'miss' or 'deviate' in the Rgveda. Rg. I. 71. 10 'old age destroys me as (the dark or clouded) sky destroys (distinctness of) forms' (nabho na rūpam jarimā mināti'); I. 124. 213 '(the dawn) which does not violate divine laws but destroys the spans of human life'; I. 179. 1 (Lopāmudrā says to Agastya) old age destroys the beauty of limbs' (mināti sriyam jarimā tanūnām); VII. 84. 4. (Varupa) who is an Aditya, who destroys the false ones and who, the valiant one, imparts immeasurable wealth'. Vide also Rg. 1.92.11, 1. 117.3, III. 32.8, IV. 30.23., V.7.4, V. 82.2 for other examples where forms of 'mi' or 'ml' occur. It is unnecessary to adduce more examples about 'mi'. It is impossible, if Prof. Apte is to be followed, that old age misses or deviates from beauty or that Asvins miss or deviate from the wiles of the demon or that Varuņa misses falsehood (or false men). Prof. Apte relies (p. 411)

Meaning of Vrata 

on Rg. I. 124. 3.14 as decisively establishing that originally 'mi' was a verb of motion. In the first place, one verse cannot demolish what many verses quoted above convey. Besides, there is nothing in Rg. 1. 124. 3 that establishes what Prof. Apte thinks it does. That verse says 'Here this daughter of heaven wearing a garment of light is seen in the east (by us) simultaneously; she (Dawn) well follows the path of sta (cosmic order), she like (a woman) knowing well does not annihilate the several quarters'. 

The sense of 'command or law' is quite appropriate in more than half the Rgvedic passages in which the word vrata occurs. In some passages the sense of ‘religious practices or modes of sacred worship’ is suitable. For example, Rg. X. 65. 11 says ' (the Viśve-devas) that are good donors make the sun rise in heaven and spread about the Arya vratas over the earth'. Vide also Řg. VI, 14, 3. 

There are several places in the Rgveda in which the words 'avrata' (11 times), 'apavrata' (in Rg. 1. 51. 9, V. 42.9, V. 40.6), 'anyavrata' (in V. 20. 2, VIII. 70. 11, X. 22. 8) occur and in almost all of which vrata must be taken to mean 'mode of worship or ethical and religious practices of the Vedic worship pers'. Prof. Apte has to admit this (pp. 479, 483). It will not do to ignore these passages in finding out the derivation and meanings of the word vrata or to clap them in a separate group (as Prof. Apte does on p. 413) and distinguish them from other passages supposed to indicate the divine phase. There is nothing to show that Vedic sages distinguished between divine vratas and other vratas meant to be followed by Heaven and Earth, rivers, mountains and human beings. Some of these passages in which the word 'avrata' occurs strongly militate against the theory of Prof. Apte. For example, 15 in Rg. 1. 101. 2 Indra is 

. 14. एषा दिवो दुहिता प्रत्यदर्शि ज्योतिर्वसाना समना पुरस्तात् । तस्य पन्थामन्वेति 

FIY Hacia afasi hatar \#. I. 124.3. The meaning of the last quarter is that Uşas always rises in the east and that she does not annihilate the separateness of the four quarters by sometimes risiog in a direction other tban the east. In this the dawn simply follows the law laid down for her in the order of nature (rtasya pantbām). The idea about the confusion of quarters is well expressed in Rg. V. 40. 5. Vide also X, 32 7.

History of Dharmaśāstra 

[ Soc. I, Ch. I 

said to have killed Pipru who was avrata and in the very next verse it is said that Varuna and Sūrya abide in the vrata of Indra and the rivers also accept his vrata. Therefore, vrata in this hymn must mean something akin to the meaning of vrata in avrata and not akin to 'tracks of luminaries'. Compare IX, 73.5 and 8 where avrata occurs with 'raksati vratam’in 1X,73.3 (both being verses about Soma). 

There are seven passages in the Rgveda where the word 'vivrata' occurs. In six of them 'vivrata' is applied to the horses of Indra. According to Prof. Apte, the only natural meaning is 'moving or wandering along diverse paths' (p. 419). But this is arguing in a circle. They can be explained if vrata is taken to mean 'ordinance, duty or practice'; when applied to horses 'vivrata' may be held to mean no more than this that two horses are yoked on two sides of the chariot and obey the various orders indicated through the pulling of the reins. The 7th passage X. 55. 3 in which "vivrata' occurs as an adjective of 

jyotih' is difficult to construe and Prof. Apte has not succeeded in satisfactorily explaining it. 

In several passages of the Rgveda phrases like 'tava vrate' Occur. Whitney (p. 409) stated that the phrase should rather mean 'in thy established or approved course, following thy lead or example', than 'under thy control or protection' or 'in thy service' as some scholars hold. Prof. Apte thinks that the translation of 'tava vrate' as 'abiding in thy ordinance' (by Macdonell) misses the point and avers that the proper meaning is dominion, authority, region of sphere'. Some of the passages containing the words 'tava vrate' are Rg. VI. 54. 9, IX. 102.5, X. 36. 13, X. 57. 6. In my opinion 'tava vrate' means 'while we abide by your ordinances'. In X. 36. 13 the first half16 is a relative clause without a verb and we have to supply a form of the root 'as' (to be) or of 'bhū'. In some verses such a form of as' does occur with the words as in Rg. I. 124. 15.17 Therefore wherever the words 'tava vrate' occur, we should generally understand that the meaning is 'while abiding by your ordinances'. This is further supported by the fact that there are passages where the word ‘vrata' and other words

Meaning of Vrata 

like 'sumati' in the locative are used with the forms of the root ‘as' to be or of verbs meaning to abide or dwell. Vide Rg. 1.83.3 ('vrate te kşeti', 'abides in thy vrata'), II. 27. 13 ('ya ādityānām bhavati pranītau', 'who is within or under the lead of Adityas); X. 14. 6 18 may we be in the good will of them (the pitrs) that deserve to have sacrifices offered to them and also in their beneficent grace'. Vide also Rg. III. 1. 21 and 11I. 59. 4, VI. 47. 13, X. 131.7 (tasya vayam sumatau...syāma). 

There are eight passages in the Rgveda in which the word śucivrata' occurs and is always applied to some god or gods. In three passages VIII, 43. 16, VIII. 44. 21, X. 118. 1 'śucivrata' is an attribute of Agni and Prof. Apte renders it as '(Agni) with a blazing trail, track or sphere' (p. 421). He says 'suci' is derived from suc'(to shine or flame up), that the word 'śuci' can only mean “brilliant or flaming', that the meaning pure' is purely figurative and secondary and is found only in about six or seven out of a total of over a hundred or more in the Rgveda when it is an epithet of' maniṣā, stoma, mati or giraḥ'. These remarks are mis-statements; 'śuci' in the sense of 'pure' is not so rare as Prof. Apte tries to make out (6 or 7 times out of 100). In one Verse alone addressed to the Maruts (Rg. VII. 56. 12) the word19 'suci' occurs six times and should ordinarily be taken only in one sense in those six and can only mean 'pure', since 'śuci' is there applied to offerings (havya) and sacrifice. In VIII. 44. 21 Agni is styled 'sucir-vipraḥ' and 'suciḥ' and 'kavih' The word 'śuci' occurs in that verse four times out of which 'śuci' as applied to 'vipra' and 'kavi' can only mean "pure or holy'. Vide II. 27. 13, where the yajamāna (sacrificer) is called 'suci', I. 142. 9 where the three goddesses Bhārati, Iļā and Sarasvati are said to be 'śuci'. Concoding for argument that the root 'śuc' originally meant to shine or blaze', the distinction of two mean ings (primary and secondary) in 'suci' had disappeared long before the Rgvedic hymns were composed, as Rg. VL. 56. 12 and other verses establish. Vide Rg. III. 62. 5 (where Bșhaspati is called suci), I. 181. 2 (where the horses of the Aśvins are styled *suci'), II. 33. 13 (where the herbs or drugs of Maruts are spoken of as suci), VII. 49.2 and 3 where waters are called 'suci' and

History of Dharmaśāstra 

(Sec. I, Ch. I 

VII. 89, 3 (where Varupa is addressed as "suci'). In the above passages the word śuci in at least a dozen cases is clearly used in the sense of pure', is applied to offerings, sacrifices, drugs, horses, waters or rivers and is not restricted to manīņā, stoma, mati and giraḥ as Prof. Apte wrongly asserts. Prof. Apte mini mises the number of times that suci' means 'pure', and observes a discreet silence about its being an attribute of the physical objects mentioned above. Therefore, there is no difficulty in holding 'sucivrata' as applied to gods meaning 'whose ordin ances are pure or holy'. In 1. 15. 11 and I. 182. 1 the word 'śucivrata' is an attribute of the Asvins, in III. 62. 17 and VI. 16. 24 of Mitra and Varuna and in VI. 70. 2 of Heaven and Earth. Besides, we have the analogous word 'śucikranda' (the loud laud addressed to whom is pure) applied to Bșhaspati in VII. 97. 5. 

The word 'mahivrata’occurs five times and is applied to Soma (IX. 97.7, IX. 100. 9), to Agni (I. 45. 3, X. 115. 3) and to Varuna (VI. 68. 9) and the word 'mahāmahivrata' to Soma (IX. 48. 2). In all these cases the meaning 'whose commands or laws are great or many' would be quite appropriate. The word 'mahi' by itself occurs in over 110 passages in the Rgveda, in all of which 'mahi' stands for 'mahat' and qualifies words like 'śravas' (food or fame), ksatra ('prowess' as in I. 54. 8 and 11), namaḥ, śarma (in I. 93. 8), dātra ('gift', as in 1. 116. 6), enas (in II. 12. 10), karma (II. 22. 1), Mahitvana (in 11. 23. 4), varūtha, draviņa (111. 1. 22), raksas (IV. 3. 14). Prof. Apte (p. 475) quite unnecessarily suggests three separate meanings of 'mahivrata', the first of which is of great dominion', 'of great tracks', 'of great exploits' and expands that meaning by interpolating the words 'mighty or resplendent sway or sphere'. 'Mahi’ hardly ever means 'resplendent' by itself. 

The word “priyavrata' occurs only once in the Rgveda (in X. 150. 3), is applied to gods and means 'to whom the ordinances laid down by them are dear'. Prof. Apte (p. 472) criticizes people who explain the word as 'whose laws we love'; but he names no one who does so. Similarly, the word 'puruyrata' occurs once only in Rg. IX. 3. 10, is applied to Soma and means 'whose ordinances are many'. Both these words do not at all help Prof. Apte in his interpretation and are rather against his pet theory (of tracks of luminaries &c.). 

The word 'dhunivrata' occurs twice (in Rg. V.58.2 and V. 87.1) and is applied to Marut or the band of Maruts. Prof. Apte (p. 435Meaning of Vrata 

section 47) takes 'dhuni' as an adjective, and as meaning 'roar ing, storming' and translates ' dhunivrata' as 'whose paths are characterised by roaring or raging' The word 'dhuni' occurs about ten times in the Rgveda and when an adjective means 'one that shakes his enemies or clouds' or is a noun meaning 'river (as in II. 15. 5). Dhuni is also the name of a demon (in Rg. VI. 18. 8, VII. 19. 4, X. 113. 9). In I. 174. 9, V. 34. 5 and 8, VI. 20.12 'dhuni' is an attribute of Indra and in I. 79. 1 of Agni. The Nirukta (V. 12) while explaining Rg. X, 89. 5 (in which both Soma and Indra are praised) explains 'dhuni' as derived from 

dhū’ to shake. Therefore 'dhunivrata' should mean whose ordinances are such as make others (breakers) tremble'. 

It is not necessary to examine separately each of the verses in which the word 'vrata' occurs and Prof. Apte's interpretations thereof. The preceding discussion is sufficient to show what vrata means in almost all passages in the Rgveda. In his zeal to buttress up his theory, Prof. Apte commits mistakes in the construction and translation of some verses. On p. 420 (section 29) he renders Rg. VIII, 94. 2 20 as 'she (Prśni) in whose lap all the gods maintain their vratas, the Sun and the Moon also, in order that they may be seen', explains that the Sun and the Moon are seen only when they keep their pratas and concludes that yratas must mean tracks followed by the Sun. Prof. Apte takes 'gūryāmāsā' as the subject of 'Dharayanto' along with Viśve-devāḥ', but *Sūryāmāsā' is in the objective case in relation to 'drse', the proper translation being in the lap of whom (i. e. of Pęśni, the mother of Maruts), all the gods uphold their laws in order that (people) may see the Sun and the Moon'. What is meant is that the Sun and the Moon rise at the proper times because the gods uphold their ordinances. If we compare VIII. 94.2 with I. 23.21 (=X.9.7), 1. 50.1, 1.52.8, X. 57.4, X. 60.5 it would be clear that my translation is the only correct one and if that be so no question of 'tracks of light' will arise. 

Misinterpretations of words like 'kşitīḥ' in III. 3. 9 eus meaning dwellings (rather it means “the common mass of people" as in III. 14, 4, VI. 65. 1, VII. 65. 2, VII. 75. 4, VII. 79.1

(Sec. I, Ch. I 

&c.) and of śruştim'on p. 450) are passed over here. On VI. 70.5 Prof. Apte remarks (p. 420, Sec. 17) that to take 'vrata' in 'madhuvrata' applied to the deities Heaven and Earth as mean ing ‘law, duty or will’ is almost absurd. One fails to see why it would be absurd to hold, when heaven and earth are spoken of as 'dropping21 madhu' (madhuścutā) and 'yielding madhu' (madhudughe), that the Vedic poet thinks that the laws of Heaven and Earth as deities are sweet (and not harsh). 

We have next to turn to the word 'dhrtavrata'which occurs eighteen times in the Rgveda. Out of these Varupa is certainly called dhṛtavrata in seven passages viz. in. I. 25.8 and 10, I. 44. 14, I. 141.9, II, 1. 4,22 VIII. 27.3 and X, 66. 5. Both Mitra and Varuna are styled 'dhṛtavrata' in I. 15.6, VIII. 25.2 and 8 (and also ‘ksatriyā' in verse 8), Indra and Varuņa are said to be dhṛtavrata in VI. 68. 10, Indra alone in VI. 19. 5 and VIII. 97. 11, the Adityas in II. 29. 1, Viśvedevāh in X. 66. 8 (and also * ksatriyāḥ'), Agni in VIII. 44. 25 and Savit; in IV. 53. 4. Prof. Apte (p. 430 para 37) avers that Varuņa is pre-eminently called dhṛtavrata (this is not quite accurate as more than half the passages in which the word 'dhrtavrata' occurs refer to gods other than Varuna), because he maintains intact the paths he has excavated for the luminaries or he sees that the fixed laws of the movements of luminaries are properly observed. Unless one has made up one's mind that yrata signifies tracks of luminaries or their fixed movements, these 'dhrtavrata' passages are of no help in settling the original meanings of vrata. They can all be well construed by taking 'dhṛtavrata' in the sense of ‘one who upholds or supports his ordinances'. Supposing that Prof. Apte is right in thinking that the epithet pre-eminently applies to Varuņa it is quite arguable that what is mainly aimed at in calling Varuna 'dhrtavrata' is the high moral level Varuņa is held by the Rgvedic sages to maintain by punishing sinners, by looking into the truth and falsehood of men (VII. 49. 3 'satyānste avapaśyan janānām'), by the fact that he is styled 'ksatriya', 'rājan' and 'samrāj' (who exacts obedience to his laws) as shown above. Therefore, the view that vrata means ordinances in connection with Varupa is far more appropriate than the theory about his seeing that the luminaries follow their tracks. In this connection the word 'dhrtavrata'23 in 1. 25.6 .

Meaning of Vrata 

becomes very important. Almost all scholars hold that that verse means '(Mitra and Varuna) fond of the donor who observes the laws of religious worship partake of the same offering (made by the donor) and they are not heedless about it (or do not miss it). Scholars hold that in this verse the word 'dhrtavrata' applies to a human worshipper and not to a god as in all other passages. Prof. Apte (p. 430 para 37) explains that the words 

dhṛtavratāya dāśuse', moan 'donor who makes a gift to (Varupa) that is dhṛtavrata.' This construction is objectionable for several reasons. There are two deities referred to in the principal sentence (the verb is 'āśāte), while dhṛtavratāya, being singular, can only be construed with one deity. Prof. Apte further relies on VIII. 94.2 of which he gives an interpretation which as shown above is wrong. Constructions parallel to 'dhrta vratāya dāśuge' and containing an adjective of the word 

dāśuse' are found in other Rgveda passages. For example, in I. 142. 1 we have 24 'O Agnil spread the ancient thread (i. e. sacrifice) for the worshipper who has extracted Soma juice', Here the words 'sutasomāya dāśuse' do not mean 'to the wor. shipper who gives offerings to the god who extracts soma'. Similarly, in VIII, 5.6 the words 'sudevāya dāśuse' mean 'to or for the worshipper (or donor) who worships god' (or for donor to whom gods are beneficent). These several considerations make it highly probable that 'dhṛtavratāya' is an attribute of a human being in I. 25.6 and not necessarily of Varuņa. If that be so, vrata in 'dhrtavrata' must mean'ordinances or mode of religious worship and not 'tracks of luminaries'. We have the word 'dhrtadaksa' (who upholds strength i. e. who is strong or constant) applied to a priest in X. 41. 3. It is worthy of note that the Satapatha Br. in explaining 25 nişasāda dhrta vrato Varupaḥ' in Rg. 1. 25. 10 (= Vāj. S. X. 27) remarks that the king and a brāhmaṇa deeply learned in the Veda are both dhṛtavrata'. It is probable that even in the times of the Rgveda people had come to assign the same meaning to the word 

dhṛtavrata' that the Sat. Br. ascribes to it. Conceding for argument that dhrtavratāya in I, 25. 6 refers to Varuna, that does not at all solve the problem of the derivation and meaning of vrata. The word 'vratanlı' occurs only once in Roveda X.

65. 6 and probably means '(the cow) that is the carrier of vrata' i. e. of the milk on which a sacrificer has to subsist. In T. S. V1. 2. 5. 2–3 it is said that milk is the Brāhmaṇa's vrata. On p. 442 Prof. Apte refers to Sūrya being called 'yratapā' very aptly. Vratapa occurs nine times in the Rgveda, but the Sun is called 'vratapā' only once in I. 83. 5. Vratapā means nothing more than vratapati, which word occurs in T. S. 1. 6. 6. 326, 1. 6.7. 2 and Vāj. S. I. 5 and is applied to Agni. In these passages 'vrata' means a religious vow such as that of a Vedic student who undertakes to study Veda after Upanayana. There is no reason why the word "vratapā' in the Rgveda should not be deemed to have been used in the sense in which 'vratapati' is employed in the T. S. and Vāj. S. Similarly, in Rg. VII. 103. 127 it is said that the frogs lying silent for a year (in crevices), like brāhmapas observing a vrata, send forth their croaking inspired by the rains. Here 'vrata' has the meaning a sacred vow or observance' which is the sense in which the word is used in medieval times and is so used even upto this day. 

There is one more word viz. vrşavrata, which is analogous to 'dhrtayrata' and which remains to be considered. That word occurs only twice (i. o. in Rg. IX. 62. 1128 and IX. 64. 1) and is an attribute of Soma. Prof. Apte (p. 485, section 48) tries to fit this word in his scheme by referring to the description of Soma as bellowing like a bull, as a bull among cows and as brandishing and sharpening his horns. One must not forget the twofold character of Soma as a very pre-eminent deity (the whole of Rg. IX. is a glorification of Soma ) and as a beverage produced from the twigs and tendrils of the Soma plant and that these two characters become mixed up. In the process of producing Soma beverage, four sounding holes called uparavas are employed29 (vide H. of Dh. vol. II. pp. 1154-55

Meaning of Vrata 

for 'uparavas'): This is described as the bellowing of Soma, when Soma is called a vrsa (bull) or vrsabha. Most of the great Vedic gods (Indra, Agni, Soma and others), their chariots, their weapons and even the exhilaration on drinking Soma are spoken of as bulls.30 When Soma twigs are being pressed with stones (grāvan) the tendrils of Soma look like horns. All these descrip tions about bellowing &c. apply strictly to the soma plant and are poetically transferred to the deity Soma. Prof. Apte translates 'yṛsavrata' as 'whose behaviour or deportinent is like that of a bull'. On the other theory also we can easily explain the word as meaning '(Soma) whose ordinances are powerful like a bull'. Vrşavrata is an attribute of god Soma and cannot be easily construed with god Soma, if vrata primarily means some physical activity and its implications are rather against Prof. Apte's theory. 

The result of this long discussion is that Prof. Apte's theory of the derivation of vrata from the root vṛt' and his long scheme of meanings is not proved and that the derivation from the root 'vr'expressly stated by Yāska at least twenty-five centuries ago and accepted by most scholars has not been at all shaken. Prof. Apte probably did not anticipate that the meaning he assigned to 'vit' would be challenged, but I dispute that meaning also. 

There are three passages of the Rgveda in which the words 'yittam na cakram'(like a round wheel) occur, viz I. 155. 6 (addressed to Visņu), IV. 31. 4, V. 36. 3 (both addressed to Indra). Prof. Apte did not mention them and they have no bear ing on the derivation of vrata. At the most those might have been relied upon for the meaning of the root 'vrt'. In this discussion we have restricted ourselves to verbal forms or present participles and omitted past passive participles which sometimes depart very much from the root-meaning as in the case of 'ksta' in Rgveda X 43.5 (krtam na svaghni vi cinoti dovane). Vṛtta' cannot mean revolving even if yṛt meant 'to revolve', it is vartamāna that might have that meaning if yot' originally meant to revolve'. Besides, Rg. I. 155.6 is obscure. It probably refers to the belt of the zodiac that goes round the sky. 

It is necessary to clarify the meanings and mutual relations of the three words sta, vrata and dharman. The meanings (three) 

30. Oply one verse need be quoted to illustrate the above. Rg. II, 16. 6 is वृषा ते वज्र उत ते वृषा रथो वृषणा हरी वृषभाण्यायुधा। वृष्णो मदस्य त्वनीशिष इन्द्र सोमस्य वृषभस्य तृपणुहि ।

of șta' have been specified in H. of Dh. vol. IV. pp. 2–5 and the meanings of vrata have been discussed in what precedes (vide pp. 5-8). In the Rgveda the word is dharman and not dharma. For a brief discussion of dharman vide H. of Dh, vol. I, p. 1. In the Rgveda sometimes dharman is masculine and often an adjective, meaning 'upholder or sustainer' as in Rg. I, 187. 1, X. 92. 2. In X. 21.3 (tve dharmāņa āsate) the word is masculine. In other cases it is obviously in the neuter gender as in I. 22. 18 (ato dharmāpi dhārayan), V. 26.6, IX. 64. 1. In these passages the meaning seems to be 'religious rites or sacrifices', thus approaching vrata in one of its senses. In I. 164. 43 and 50 (= X. 90.16) sacrifices are said to be the primeval dharmans. Vide also 'prathamā dharmā' in Rg. III. 17. 1 and 'sanatā dharmāņi' in Rg. III. 3.1. In some cases this sense of dharman would not do, as in IV. 53, 3, V. 63. 7. where the meaning seems to be 'fixed principles or rules of conduct'. In some cases dharman appears to mean almost the same thing as 'vrata'. For example, in VII. 89. 531 the sage says 'when we destroy (or violate) your dharmans through heedlessness (or infatuation), do not harm us, O Varuņa, on account of that sin', which is just the same as Rg. I. 25. 1, where we have 'vratam' for dharmāpi. In VI. 70.133 it is said 'heaven and earth, neper decaying and endowed with plenty of seed, are held firmly apart by the dharman of Varuna'. In VIII. 42.1 (cited above) making the Heaven firmly fixed is described as one of the vratas of Varupa. 

Though in this way in somne passages even of the Rgveda the senses of 'vrata' and 'dharman' appear to have coalesced, there are verses where all the three words or two of the three occur. It may be noted that even in what are regarded by Western scholars to be later portions of the Atharvaveda (e. g. 18.2.7, 14. 1. 51) the word is dharman. All three words occur in Rg. V. 63.733 O wise Mitra and Varuņa! You naturally (or according to your fixed rule of conduct) guard your ordinances with the wonderful power of an asura; you rule over (or shine over) the whole world according to the principle of cosmic order, you establish in the heaven the Sun that is (like) a brilliant

chariot'. Vrata and dharman occur in V. 72.2 and VI. 70. 334; sta and vrata occur in I. 65.2, II. 27.8, III. 4.7, X. 65. 8. Speak ing generally, 'rta' is the cosmic order that has been there from the most ancient times. Vrata means the laws or ordinances supposed to be laid down by all gods or by individual gods. Dharman meant religious rites or sacrifices or fixed principles. Gradually the conception 'rta' became faint and receded into the background and 'satya' took its place. Dharman became an all-embracing conception and vrata came to be restricted to sacred vows and rules of conduct to be observed by a person as a member of a community or as an individual.

definition and importance of Vratas. 

After dealing with the etymology and semantic development of the word 'vrata' from the passages of the Rgveda in which the word occurs, it is now time to tarn to the other Vedic Samhitās and the Brāhmaṇas for finding out how that word is dealt with in them. Some of the Rgvedic verses occur in other Vedic Samhitās. In several such passages vrata appears to mean * divine ordinances' or 'ethical patterns of conduct'. For example, the verse35 Rg. I. 22. 19 'Mark the deeds of Visnu, the helpful friend of Indra, whereby he watches over his ordinances' occurs also in T. S. I. 3.6.2, Atharva VII. 26.6, Vāj. S. VI. 4; Rg. VIII. 11. 136 'O Agnil thou art a God that protects ordinances among (gods and) men, thou art to be praised in sacrifices' is also found in Atharva 19. 59. 1, Vāj. S. IV. 16, T.S. I. 1. 14. 4-5 and I. 2.3.1; Rg. I. 24.15 is found in Vāj. S. XII. 12 and Atharva VII. 83 (88) 3 and XVIII, 4. 69; Rg. X. 191. 3 is almost the same as Atharva37 VI. 64.2, the latter substituting the word 'vratam' for 'manaḥ' in the former and thereby indicating that 'vrata' means “resolve to undertake a religious observance'; Rg. VII. 103. 1, in which frogs that lie down silent for a year and begin to croak at the advent of the rains are com pared to brāhmaṇas observing a religious vow, occurs in the Atharyaveda IV. 15. 13; Rg. X. 12. 5 is the same as Atharva XVIII. 1. 33; Rg. X. 2.4 is almost the same as Atharva XIX. 59.2; Rg. I. 84. 12 is equal to Atharva XX. 109. 3; in all of which the words vratam and vratāni occur. Agni is frequently called 

vratapāḥ' in the Rgveda (V. 2.8, VI. 8.%, VIII. 11. 1, X. 32.6) and also Sūrya is so called (Rg. I. 83.5.). In the other Samhitās Agni is styled ‘vratapā' as well as 'vratapati' (protector or lord of vratas). Atharva XX. 25.5 (Sūryo vratapā) is the same as Rg. I. 83.5, Atharva XIX. 59.1 (tvam-Agne vratapā asi) is same as

Vrata in other Samhitās 

Rg. VIII. 11.1; Vaj. S. I. 5.38 says 'O Agni, lord of vratas! I shall undertake a religious observance (or obligation). May I be able to carry it out, may that (undertaking) of mine succeed; here do I approach truth from untruth'. The T. S. I. 3.4.3 also styles Agni 'vratapati'. Here and there Vedic Samhitas other than the Rgveda do employ the word 'vrata' in the sense of 'ordin ances of a god or of gods' as in T. S. IV. 3. 11.1,2,3 or Atharva VII. 40 (41). 1, VII. 68 (70). 1 ('Sarasvati vratesu te'). But in many places in all the Samhitās (other than the Rgveda) and in the Brāhmapas and Upanisads generally the ordinary senses of vrata are two, viz. (1) religious observance of vow, or restric tions as to food and behaviour when one has undertaken a reli gious vow, or (2) the special food, that is prescribed for susten ance when a person is engaged in a religious rite or undertaking, such as cow's milk, yaragu. (barley gruel) or the mixture of hot milk and curds (called āmikşā). Both meanings of vrata are ĝiven by Yāska in his Nirukta39. A few passages from the Samhitās and Brāhmaṇas are cited below to illustrate both meanings. For the first meaning, vide the following: T. S. II. 5.5.6 'thist0 is his yrata (vow); he should not speak what is untrue, should not eat flesh, should not approach a woman (for sexual intercourse), nor should his apparel be washed with water impregnated with cleansing salt; for, all these things the gods do not do'; T. S. V.7.6.141 birds are indeed fire; when one who has performed Agnicayana eats the (flesh of) birds, he would be eating fire and would meet with disaster (or distress); (therefore) he should observe this vrata (not to eat bird's flesh) for a year,

for vrata does not extend beyond a year'. The śānkbayana 42 Br. VI. 6 prescribes 'He has to observe the vrata, viz. that he should not see the rising sun nor the setting sun'. The Tai. Ā. I. 26.6 states "this is the vrata for him (for him who has per formed Āruņaketuka-cayana), viz. he should not run while it is raining, should not urinate or void ordure in water, should not spit, should not bathe naked, should not step over lotus leaves or gold, should not eat (the flesh) of a tortoise'. 

The Bṛhadārangakopanişad (I. 5. 21-23) remarks "now begins the consideration about vrata; Prajāpati indeed created the organs, which when created, vied with each other; speech stood fast (by the view) 'I shall only speak' (and do nothing else).'... Therefore one should perform only one yrata, viz. one should only breathe in and should emit breath, for fear that otherwise (if one were to engage in the activities of the other organs) wicked Death may seize him”:43 It is stated in the Tai. Up. III. 7-10 'one should not speak ill of food; that is the vrata, ...one should not shun food, that is the vrata...one should prepare much food...one should not refuse residence to a man whatever (when he comes as a stranger seeking shelter), that is the vrata; therefore one should secure plenty of food by some method or other.'44 In the Chāndogyopanişad (adhyāya II, khandas 13-21) the words 'tad vratam' occur several times in relation to the injunctions when one is engaged in the upāsanā of several Sāmans not to complain about the hot sun, raining cloud, seasons, lokas (worlds), domestic animals, brāhmaṇas and the injunction not to eat marrow for a year (or not to eat it at all). 

A few passages from the Vedic Literature may be cited for the second meaning of vrata (food for sustenance &c.) men 

42. 74 ang hari ni al . T. VI. 6. $. IV. 1. 3 refers to this text and Sabara remarks that these are fattigas, tbat they are

tioned above. The T. S. (VI. 2. 5. 1.) remarks 45 'he (diksita) observes the vrata taking the milk from one udder, then from two udders, then from three, then from four; this is called kşurapavi (razor-edge) vrata; barley gruel is the vrata of a ksatriya (when dikşita), āmiksā (hot milk and curds mixed) of a vaiśya.' The Satapatha Br. provides 46 that a dīksita (one who has under gone the consecration ceremony for a vedic sacrifice) should subsist on milk. In another place the Satapatha says ‘for him he heats vrata! (i. e. the food or milk). The Ait. Br. also provides 47 that the diksita first takes (the milk) from four udders as vrata on the Upasad days, then from three &c. Vide T. A. II. 8 48 milk is the vrata of a brāhmana (sacrificer); yavāgū of a ksatriya and āmiksā of a vaisya. 

It appears that in the times of the Brāhmaṇas the word. vrata ' had come to have two secondary senses derived from the sense of religious observance or obligation'; viz. 'a proper course or pattern of conduct for a person', and 'an upavāsa' i. e. the sacrificer's staying at night near Gārhapatya fire or fasting. As illustrative of the first may be cited a passage that occurs towards the end of the Ait. Br. viz. 'this is the vrata for him (for the king who has performed what is called 'brahmanah parimarah') that he should not sit down before his enemy sits down (but should do so after), if he thinks (from information received) that his enemy is standing the king should also stand up; he should not lie down before his enemy (does so); if the king thinks that (the enemy) has sat down he may then himself sit down; he should never sleep before his enemy sleeps; if he thinks that the enemy is awake he should himself keep awake;

even if the enemy has his head as hard as a stone (or has a stone helmet on his head), he (the king who performs the jarimara) quickly overthrows him'.4) 

The other secondary meaning of crust: seems to be uprūsa (i. e. Yajamāna's passing the night in the Darsa-isti and the Pūrņamāsa-isti near the Gārhapatya and other fres, or reducing his intake of food or fasting): " that he performs uparāsa in Darśa and Pūrņamāsa istis is so because the gods do not partake of the offering made by one who has not undergone vrata; there fore he undergoes upavāsa with the thought the gods may partake of my offering'" (Ait. Br. VII. II )5) 

Coming to the Srautasūtras, 51 the two principal meanings of vrata mentioned above often figure in them. For example, the Ap. Sr. S. IV. 2. 5-7, IV. 16. 11, V. 7. 6 and 16, V. 8. 1, V. 25. 2-20, IX. 3. 15, XI. 1. 7 and IX. 18. 9, Asv. Sr. S. II. 2. 7, III. 13. 1-2, San. Sr. S. II. 3. 26 may be referred to for the first meaning and Ap. Sr. S. X. 12. 4, X. 17.6, XI. 15. 3 and 6 for the second (viz. food or milk &c.). The Grhyasatras and Dharamasutras also present the same meaning of vrata. For sample, the Āśv. Gr. III. 10. 5-7 states : these are the vratas for him, viz. he should not bathe at night, nor bathe naked, nor run while it is raining 

49. तस्य व्रतम् । न द्विषतः पूर्व उपविशेद्यदि तिष्ठन्तं मन्येत तिष्ठेतैव न द्विषतः पूर्वः संविशेद्यद्यासीनं मन्येतासीतैब न द्विषतः पूर्वः प्रस्त्रप्याद्यदि जायतं मन्येत जानियादेवापि ह यद्यस्याश्ममूर्धा द्विषन्भवति क्षिप्रं हैवनं स्तृणुते । ऐ. प्रा. VIII. 28.

The ते सं I. 6. 7.3 appears to refer to both these significances of upavasa 'उपास्मिन्छो यक्ष्यमाणे देवता वसन्ति य एवं विद्वानग्निमुपस्तृणाति ... यदना श्वानुपवसेपितृदेवत्यः स्यात् ।'. सायण explains on ऐ. ब्रा 'गार्हपत्यादिसमीपे यो वासः स उपचासः। यद्वा देवा अस्यापि यज्ञे समीपे वसन्तीत्येतदीयोनुष्ठानसङ्कल्प उपवासः। ... यद्वा ग्राम्याशनपरित्याग उपवासः। तत्परित्यज्यारण्याशनरूपं नियनं स्वीकुर्यात् । अनाश्वान् is 

n. sing. of अनाश्चम (one who has not eaten, one who is fasting).

&c.; the Pār. Gṛ. II. 8 says that the sniitaka has to follow for three days after sumūrartını certain observances such as not eating flesh, not using earthen vessels for drinking water, not seeing women, sūdras, corpses and crows, not speaking with Śūdras, not urinating nor voiding ordure nor spitting in front of the sun, or he should simply speak the truth (instead of observing the other requirements of this passage). Gautama (VIII. 15), Śāökhāyana-gihya (II. 11-12), Gobhila-gphya (III. 1. 26-31 ) and others mention certain irtas (now obsolete) which every Vedic student was to undergo. Vide H. of Dh. vol. II, pp. 370–373 for descriptions of these. The Ap. Dh. S. H. 1.1.1 ff specifies52 the observances to be followed by the husband and wife from the day of their marriage such as eating only twice in the day, not eating to satiety, fasting on parvan days. Similarly, the Ap. Dh. S. (I. 11. 30. 6, I. 11. 31 ) sets out the observances for snūtakas (atha snātaka-vratāni). Pāṇini has a special sūtra 'vrate' (III. 2. 80 ) for explaining the formation of words from trata with the affix in (nini) preceded by a substantive such as 'sthandilaśāyin' and 'aśrāddha-bhoji' (one who has taken the vow of not par taking of śrāddha food). Pānini (III. 1. 21 )53 also teaches the formation of a denominative verb from vrata in the sense of 

doing' (vratuyati vratun karoti). It is the Kāśikā that adda a vārtıka (absent in the Mahabhāsya) that the verb so derived expresses both the oating of food and the eschewing of it., 

As prayascittas (expiations) involved the observance of several strict rules they came to be called vratas in Manu (XI. 117, 170,176,181), Yājñavalkya (III. 251, 252, 254, 258), Sankha (17.6, 22, 42, 61, 62 ) and other smitis. In the Mahābhārata the word vrata is mainly used in the sense of a religious undertaking or vow in which one has to observe certain restrictions about food or one's general behaviour. Vide Vanaparva 296. 3, Udyoga 39. 71-72, Santi 35.39, Anušāsana 103. 34. It was also applied in the epic to a course or pattern of conduct or behaviour not necessarily religious. For example, in the Sabhāparva 58. 16 Yudhisthira says that it has been his constant vow that he would not refuse dice-play when he was challenged to it.54 Apart from

(Sec. I, Ch. II 

the secondary applications of the word vrata, its principal meaning from at least the first centuries of the Christian era onwards has been that of a religious undertaking or yow, observed on a certain tithi, week day, month or other period, for securing some desired object by the worship of a deity, usually accompanied by restrictions as to food and behaviour. This is the sense in which the word vrata will be used in this section. Vratas may be expiatory (i. e. they will be prāyaścittas) or obligatory (such as the vratas of a brahmacārin or snātaka or householder) or they may be voluntary and self-imposed for securing some specific end. Expiatory vratas have already been dealt with in the 4th volume of the H. of Dh. under Prāyaścittas. The vratas of a brahmacārin, of snātaka and of the householder have been treated of in volume II of the H. of Dh. Vratas or vows that are more or less self-imposed will be discussed in this section of the 5th volume. 

Vows are found in all religions. The Old Testament and the New Testament both bear witness to the sacredness of vows, vide Isaiah 19.21, Job 22.27, Psalms 22. 25, Acts 21. 23. The Jainas have five great vows and the Buddhists have the pañca-śīlas. 

A great deal of discussion is found in the medieval digests on a comprehensive definition of vrata. Sabara5s on Jai. VI. 2. 20 arrives at the conclusion that by vrata is meant a mental activity, which is a resolve in the form “I shall not do this" and gives as an illustration the sentence one should not see the rising or setting sun'. Medhātithi on Manu IV. 13 seems to accept this. The Agnipurāņa56 provides 'a restrictive rule declared by the śāstras is called vrata, which is also regarded as tapas; restraint of senses and other rules are but special incidents of vrata; vrata is called tapas because it causes hardship to the performer (of the vrata) and it is also called niyama since there in one has to restrain the several organs of sense'.

Definition of vrata 

declaress7 ' resolve is the root of desires, of sacrifices, of vratas and the characteristics called yamas-all are known to spring from rosolve'. But every sankalpa entertained by any person whatever is not and cannot be called vrata. It may be noted that the Amarakośa holds 58 that the words 'niyama'and 'vrata'are synonyms and that the latter consists of fast and the like that produce merit (punja), while the Ap. Dh. S. I. 2, 57 remarks that the word tapis is applied to the rules of conduct prescribed for a brahmacarin (' niyamesu tapahsabdah'). The Mitaksara 59 on Yaj. I. 129 appears to indicate that vrata is a mental resolve to do something or refrain from doing something, both being enjoined as duties. It is therefore that Srīdatta (probably taking his cue from Sabara and the Mit.) in his Samaya-pradipa defines vrata as 'a definite resolve relating to a certain matter held as obligatory' and proceeds to lay down that it may be positive (being in the form 'I must do it') or negative (I must not do this'). He further holds that a resolve 60 made with the addition of a condition not enjoined by śāstras is not a vrata: 0. g. if a man were to declare that he would observe a fast if his father would not forbid it and that otherwise he would not, this would not be a vrata and that, since sankalpa is the principal matter in a vrata, if a man of weak intellect or an ignorant man observes a fast without sankalpa, it would be simply so

much physical hardship but no yrata. The Krtyaratnākara 61 mentions several definitions of vrata given by its predecessors, one of which by Deveśvara was that 'a vrata is that which is included in the vratakānda'. This last is a desperate effort at definition and leaves the inquirer hardly wiser than before. That sankalpa is closely connected with vrata cannot be gainsaid and follows from a verse of Laghu-Vişnu 62 'the choosing of stviks is the starting point of a sacrifice, sankalpa that of vrata and of a japa of mantras (in honour of a deity)'. Sūlapāņi defined vrata on almost the same lines as Sridatta. Laksmi dhara in his Krtyakalpataru on vrata does not define vrata but begins his treatment of vrata with vrataprašamsā. Prof. K. V. Rangaswami Aiyangar in his Introduction to the Vratakāņda of the Krtyakalpataru remarks (p. XXIII) 'Raghu nandana in his Vrata-tattva also avoids any attempt to define vrata'. Prof. Aiyangar did not notice that Raghunandana discusses the question of the definition of vrata in his Ekādasi tattva (Jiv. vol. II. p. 7) and therefore he did not repeat the definition in the Vratatattva. Raghunandana mentiong63 the definitions of vrata given by Nārāyana and Sridatta, does not agree that vrata is a sankalpa but holds that vrata means various rites about which a resolve is made and also that yrata is a niyama (a restrictive rule ) enjoined by the śāstra, charac terised by uparūsa and the like and not every niyama such as *stukālābhigāmi syāt' (Yāj. I. 79, Manu III. 45). The Vrata prakāśa (a part of Viramitrodaya) defines vrata as 'a special sankalpa concerning what is well known to the learned as vrata,' just as mantras are those that are well-known among the learned as mantras.64 The Dharmasindhu (p. 9) defines vrata as a kind

of religious rite consisting of pūja and the like. Although at the root of every vrata and as an urge for it, there must be a sankalpa it appears to me that Raghunandana and the Dharma sindhu properly represent the popular meaning of vrata. A vrata comprehends several items such as snāna (bath), the morn ing prayer (prātaḥ-sandhyā), sankalpa, homa, pījū of the deity or deities in whose honour or for securing whose favour the vrata is undertaken, upavāsa, feeding of brāhmanas, maidens or married women or the poor and helpless (according to the nature of the vrata), gifts (of cows, money, apparel, sweetmeats &c.) and the observance of certain rules of conduct during the period of the vrata. Some of these matters will be dealt with in detail later on, but a few may be disposed off here. Some writers relying on Sātātapa said that before a vrata was undertaken a Viddhi-šrāddha must be performed.65 The Agnipurāna (175. 12) states that one who undertakes a vrata must always take a bath (every day), should subsist on a limited quantity of food, should worship and honour his guru, gods and brāhmaṇas and should eschew ksāra, ksaudra, lavana, honey and meat. Devala states67 without partaking of food (the previous night), after bathing and concentrating one's mind, one should, after invok ing the Sun and other deities to be present, commence a vrata in the morning'. The general tendency of medieval writers to go on adding details to what was originally brief is seen at work here also. The Vratakālaviveka says that before sapkalpa, there

should be remembrance of Nārāyana and namaskāra to him, as laid down by Yogiyājñavalkya. There is difference of opinion about the worship of Ganesa.68 The Vratakālaviveka quotes the Padmapurāņa for the order in which the several deities are to be worshipped and honoured after sankalpa and refutes the idea that the worship of Ganesa should always precede the worship of other deities. Though the general rule is that69 the sankalpa of a vrata is to be made in the morning, still there are some passages to the contrary. For example, the Bhavisyapurāņa70 (Uttara 11. 6-8) provides that on the evening of Āsādha Full Moon one should declare a resolve as follows “from tomorrow for one month in Srāvana, I shall take a bath, observe brulmacarya, take one meal only after evening, sleep on the ground, will be compassionate to all living beings'. 

There is a difference between homa and pūja. A homa with Vedic mantras, according to ancient authorities, cannot be performed by women and śūdras. Though theoretically the three varnas were entitled to perform homa with Vedic mantras some learned brāhmaṇas held the view that in the Kaliyuga no proper ksatriyas and vaisyas existed.71_Even as to Sudra 72 some writers like Kamalakarabhatta went so far that a śūdra could not read and study open purānas but should only listen to their

recital by brāhmanas. The result was that most people per formed only pūjā and not homa in Agni. According to most writers the homa was to be performed in honour of that deity for whose favour the yrata was performed. According to Vardha māna and a few others the homa in a vrata may be in honour of the deity of the vrata or may be a vyāhștihoma.73 It is stated by the Agnipurāņa 74 that there is japa, homa and also gifts at the end of all yratas in general and the Visnudharmottara observes that those who perform upavāsavrata should inaudibly mutter the mantras of that deity, should meditate on that deity, should listen to stories about that deity, should worship the image of that deity, should take the names of that deity and listen to others singing the names. Pūrvamimāṁsā writers made a distinction between homa, yūga and dāna. Sabara 75 on Jai. IV. 2. 28 puts the distinction in a nutshell by saying that'giving up what belongs to one is common to all the three, but yāga means simply giving up something intending it for a deity and accompanying it with a mantra; in homa there is in addition the throwing of a thing in fire; dāna consists in abandoning a thing that belongs to one and creating the owner ship of another in that thing.' In another place (on Jai. IX. 1. 6), Sabara refers to the argument that yāga is nothing but the worship of a deity (api ca yāgo nāma devatāpūjā). 

Manu II. 176 and Yāj. I. 99, 100, 102 show that Devapūjā is different from76 homa and was performed after the latter according to Marici and Hārīta quoted in the Smṛticandrikā, Smrti-muktā

phala and other digests. Certain matters connected with devapūjā such as the questions whether images of gods were worshipped in the times of the Rgveda and the Samhitās, whether the worship of images arose spontaneously among the Vedic Aryans or whether it was derived from some other race or sectarians or from sūdras and Dravidian tribes, have already been dealt with at some length in H. of Dh. vol. II. pp. 705-712. Similarly, descriptions of devapūjā and the several items and stages in the procedure of devapūjā have been set out in H. of Dh. vol. II. pp. 726--735. A few matters either not set out there at all or briefly set out may be spoken of here. It should be noted that ordinarily there are 16 upacārasn (items of showing honour) in the procedure of devapūjā, but they may be increased to 36 or 38 or reduced to 14, 12, 10 or 5 and there is no complete unanimity on the question of the names of the 16 upacaras and their order. The Brahmavaivartapurāņa sets out what the sixteen, twelve and five upacāras are. The Vratarka quotes Ferses enumerating 38, 16, 10 or 5 upacāras. If a person is unable to offer even five upacāras then he should offer two, viz. sandalwood paste and flowers and if he cannot do even that, then he may offer only devotion. So says the Kalikapurana quoted in Varsakriya-kaumudi p. 157. From Sabara's bhāşya on Jai. V. 1. 4 it follows that long before his day (not later than 4th century A. D.) the order (krama) of the upacāras had been settled.78 Medieval works like the Vratāska (folio 23 b ff) and V. K. K. pp. 200-201

The व. क्रि. को. p 156 notes that there is slight difference in the order in which some apacāras are offered '

(quoting Nrsimhapurāna 62. 8-14) prescribe for all vratas in general the recital of each of the sixteen versos of the Purusasūkta (Rg. X. 90) with each of the sixteen upacāras in order (viz. āvāhana, āsana, pādya, arghya, ācamaniyaka, snāna, vastra, yajñopavīta, anulepana (or gandha), puspa, dhūpa, dipa, nai vedya, tāmbūla, daksiņā, pradaksiņā); while some works associate with each of these one or more Paurāņika mantras also. It should not be supposed that these upacaras (particularly puspa, gandha, dhūpa, dīpa and naivedya) were absent in the Vedic age and came into prominence at a very late stage by being borrowed from non-Aryan people. The Aśvins are described as wearing wreaths of blue lotuses (puskarasrajā) in Rg X. 184. % and Atharva III. 22. 4; the Maruts also are spoken of as wearing wreaths (Rg. V. 53. 4). In numerous passages the Rgveda refers to the casting of offerings (havya) mixed with clarified butter in Agni (e. g. Rg. III. 59. 1 and 5).79 The gods are even asked to eat apūpa, purodāśa, dhānā, milk, curds, honey &c. in Rg. III. 53. 8, III. 52. 1-7, IV. 32. 16, VIII. 91. 2, in Atharva XVIII. 4. 16–26. The underlying conception in these passages is the same as that involved in offering naivedya to an image. In the Satapatha Br. So the word upacara appears to have been used in the sense of 'honour' or 'mode of showing honour.' In the Tai. Ā. X. 40 81 occurs a mantra called 'Medha-janana' which was recited in the ear of a child in the jātakarma 'may god Savitr, goddess Sarasvati and the gods Aśvins wearing wreaths of blue lotuses produce in you intelligence'. There is evidence that long before the time of the gphyasūtras several of the sixteen upacārag were well-known. The Nighanțu (III. 14) enumerates 44 verbs that have the sense of worship' among which pujayati' is

included. The Nirukta in explaining the word 'supāṇiḥ' occurring in Rg. III. 33. 6 states that the word 'pāņi' is 82 derived from 'paņ' to offer pūjā and supports this derivation by saying that people worship gods by joining together their hands. It is clear that the Nighanțu treated 'pūjayati' as a verb occurring in the Vedas and that folding the hands (i. e. namaskāra) was a item of worship long before the Nirukta. While explaining the word 'saparyan' occurring in Rg. III. 31. 1 the Nirukta offers 'pūjayan' as a synonym. From Pāṇini 83 V. 3. 99 and the Mahābhāsya thereon it is clearly seen that in the days of the former images of gods were made for sale and also for worship. Patañjali expressly says that the rule applies to images which were worshipped and which gave livelihood to the Pujaris of those images and not to images made for sale. Vide also Mahābhāsya on Pāṇini I. 1. 25. The Āśv. Gr. 84 provides that when madhu parka is to be offered to a styik, an ācārya, a bride groom, a king or a snātaka or a relative (like father-in-law, paternal or maternal uncle), a seat, water for washing the feet, argbya water, water for ācamana, honey mixture, a cow are to be announced to the guest three times in each case. In another place, the same sūtra 85 speaks of the presentation of sandal-wood paste, flowers, incense, lamp and garment to the brāhmaṇas invited at a śrāddha. In these two passages alone nine of the 16 upacāras are mentioned. The word pūjā took on a secondary meaning, viz. (honour without use of gandha, puspa &c.) even in the times of Dharmasūtrās (vide Ap. Dh. S. I. 4. 14. 9, 'nityā ca pūjā yathopadeśam'). Yāj. (I. 229 ff) mentions in srāddha āvāhana, arghya, gandha, mālya, dhūpa, dipa &c. When the worship of images became common, the

Origin of pājā 

upacaras that had been offered for showing honour and worship to worthy men were by a natural analogy employed in it. In my view the theory that pūjā and the upacāras were borrowed from the Dravidians or some non-Aryan people cannot be held to be proved, is quite speculative and that 'pūjā' of images of gods was an indigenous development. Medieval writers were careful to point out that there was no essential difference between yāga (vedic or other sacrifice) and pājā, as in both there was the giving of some substance intending it for a deity. Prof. J. Charpentier contributed a paper on the meaning and etymology of pūjā' to the Indian Antiquary vol. 56. pp. 93-99 and pp. 130 ff. I demur to his conclusions. He points out that 'pu' in Tamil means 'flower', that the word pūjā is derived from Dravidian 

pūcu', 'pūsu' to paint or daub' (p. 133) and asks the question why red colour is used in the worship of Gods; he himself answers it by suggesting that it was a substitute for blood. There is no reason whatever for assuming that pūjā was derived from 'pu' and not from 'puspa' (flower) which was known to the Rgveda (II. 13. 7 'puspinih'and X. 97.3 'puspavatih'). There is no sound reason to assume that 'pūcu' (to paint) existed thousands of years ago in Dravidian languages and was not a more recent acquisi tion, when the word pūjā can be traced a thousand years before any existing literary work in any Dravidian language.86 

Some works on vratas treat at great length the several upacāras, particularly flowers that should be offered to the various images worshipped, the consequences of offering those flowers, the various kinds of fragrant substances (gandha) to be offered or the incense to be burnt, the nature of the foods &c. Vide for example, Hemādri (on vrata) vol. I, pp. 49-51, Krtyaratnakara pp. 70-71, 77-79, Varsakriyakaumudi pp. 156-181. For reasons of space it is not possible to treat of these matters here. Besides, H. of Dh. vol. II. (pp. 731-734) deals at some length with the unguents, the flowers, the lamps, the naivedya to be offered in the ordinary devapūjā. A few matters not mentioned there are set out here for the sake of completeness of treatment. The Sm. C. 1. p. 201 quotes the Padmapurāņa87 to the effect that sandal wood is holy among unguents (gandha), agaru (Agalochum)

is better than sandalwood, dark agaru is still better and saffron is preferable to dark agaru. Hemādri (on vrata vol. I. pp. 43–44) quotes passages from several purāṇas defining88 catuḥsama as tvak i. e. cinnamon, patraka ( cassia leaf), lavanga i, e. cloves, and saffron (or two parts of musk, four of sandalwood, three of saffron and one of camphor) and sarvagandha as saffron, sandalwood, uśira (fragrant roots of a plant), mustā, lāmajja (root of fragrant grass), camphor and the three perfumed things viz. tvak, cardamom and patraka and Yaksakardama as camphor, agiru, musk, sandalwood and kakkola. The Agnipurāņa (chap. 202.1) first states that Hari is pleased by the offerings of flowers, perfumes, incense, lamps and naivedya and then specifies the flowers that are fit for offering to the deities and that are unfit (verses 2-15). The Kalpataru on vrata (pp. 180–181) quotes the Bhavisyapurāṇa (Brāhmaparva 197.1-11) for stating the consequences of using various flowers in worship, viz. worship with mālati flowers leads the worshipper in the presence of god, worship with karavira flowers confers health and incomparable prosperity, by the flowers of Mallikā the worshipper becomes endowed with all pleasures, with pundarika (lotuses) he secures bliss and lasting wealth, with flowers of the fragrant kubjaka he secures highest prosperity, with lotuses (white and blue) he secures spotless fame, with various mukurakas (Jasminium zambac) he is freed from disease, worship with Mandāra flowers destroys all kinds of leprosy, and with bilya flowers he obtains wealth, with arka flowers the Lord Sun confers blessings, with a garland of bakula flowers the worshipper has a beautiful daughter, the Sun worshipped with Kimśuka flowers does away with trouble, with Agastya flowers the deity gives success and worship with lotuses gives a beautiful wife, with vanamālā the worshipper becomes free from tiredness; the worshipper of the Sun with Asoka flowers makes no mistakes, and the Sun worshipped with japā (china rose) flowers frees the worshipper from trouble. About dhūpa (incense burnt in worship) a good deal is said in the digests. The Kalpataru

Dhūpa in pūjā 

(on vrata pp. 182-183)99 observes as follows: The Sun comes near (i. e. favours) a worshipper who burns sandalwood and confers desired objects when one burns agaru as dhūpa; one who desires health should burn guggulu; the Sun is always pleased by the use of pindanga (i. e. silhaka) and confers health, wealth and the highest bliss; a man secures blessedness by using kundaka (the exudation of sallaki) as dhūpa and trade becomes fruitful by using srivāsaka (sarala) as dhūpa and one gets wealth by burning rasa (myrrh) and sarjarasa (resin of the sal tree). Bāņa in the Kādambari (pārvārdha, para 56) refers to the practice of burning guggulu in the temple of Candikā. Kalpataru (on vrata pp. 6-7), Hemādri (on vrata) vol. I. pp. 50-51, Krtya ratnākara p. 78 quote several verses from the Bhavisyapurāna defining dhūpas called 'amrta', 'ananta', yaksānga, mahānga. The Bhavisyapurāņa %0 remarks: the jūti is the best among flowers, kundaka is the best dhūpa, saffron is best among fragrant substances, sandalwood among unguents; ghee is best for lighting lamps and modaka sweets among naivedya foods. It may be noted that the burning of guggulu and other substances had a practical end in view, viz. the destruction of fleas and bees. 

It is no doubt true that in most vratas brāhmaṇas are to be fed, but one should not run away with the idea that the blind, the poor and the helpless were altogether forgotten. In the case of many vratas it is expressly provided that food should be given to the blind, the poor and the helpless. In describing the Aviyoga vrata, both the Kalpataru (on vrata p. 75) and Hemādri quote a long passage from the Kālikāpurāna in which it is provided that on the day of the yrata tasteful and well-flavoured food and drink without stint should be distributed to the helpless, the blind and

The Bhavisya (Uttara, 22. 33-34)93 recommends that one observing a vrata should provide food for the blind, the distressed and the helpless according to his means, As in the case 94 of śrāddhas, particularly at Gayā, the Purānas often enjoin lavish expenditure on vratas and condemn stinginess or spending less on them than one is able to spend. Vide Matsya 100.36. The Bhavisyottara 95 on Ubhayadvādaśīyrata states the performer of Ubhayadvādaśīvrata being solely devoted to Krsna should not be tricky (spend less) in spending wealth'. In respect of Aviyogaprata the Kālikā-purāna provides the performer free from trickiness about wealth should give an equivalent to the brāhmaņas or the couple if he is unable (to give pearls and precious stones)'. Vide also Padma VI. 39. 21, Matsya 62. 34, 93. 109,95. 32,98. 12. 

There are certain virtues that the person undergoing a vrata has to cultivate. The Agnipurāņa speaks% of ten virtues that

must be cultivated as common to all vratas viz. 'forbearance, truthfulness, compassion, charity, purity (of body and mind), curbing the organs of sense, worship of deities (or images), offerings into fire, contentment, not depriving another of his property. This ten-fold dharma is declared as common to all vratas.' Devala prescribes : brahmacarya (celibacy), purity, truthfulness and giving up of flesh-eating—these four are the highest (virtues) in vratas. Brahmacarya is lost by looking at (stranger) women, touching them and engaging in talk with them, but not by sexual intercourse with one's wife during the allowed days after her monthly illness'. The Nāradiyapurāņa remarks 'brahmacarya is prescribed for being observed in all vratas and it is declared that generally sacrificial food is eaten'. Havisyānna is variously defined. Manu” says 'the food proper for hermits (such as nivūra), milk, juice of soma plant, flesh that has not become putrid, and aksaralavana (natural salt) these are declared to be (fit) sacrificial food by nature'. Though flesh was offered in śrāddhas in the times of the soveral early amṛtis such as that of Yāj. flesh must be excluded from the list of proper foods in the case of yratas owing to the express provi sions contained in Devala-smrti (cited above) and others. Vide H. of Dh. vol. IV. p. 149 n. 343 for havisya food. The Krtyaratna kara”quotes a long passage from the Samayapradipa on what food should be partaken in vratas viz. 'first come yavas (barley), on failure of them vrihi ( rice), on failure of this, other food except 

māsa (black beans), kodrava, gram, masura (a kind of pulse), cina and kapittha'. There are somewhat conflicting passages in the several Purānas about the foods that are acceptable or

should be rejected. For example, the Agnipurana100 ( in 175. 12) first states that ksara, lavana, honey and flesh should be eschewed in vrata, then (in 175. 13-14) includes among ksāra all cereals in pods except sesame and mudga, and among corn wheat and kodravas and several others are included in kşāra group (i. e. they are to be eschewed in Vrata) and proceeds (175. 14-15) 'rice, sastika (corn that ripens in sixty days from the date of sowing), mudga, kalaya (peas), sesame and yava, śyāmāka (millet), nivāra (wild rice grains), wheat and others are beneficial (i. e. allowed) in vratas, while one should give up (in vrata) kūşmānda (pumpkin gourd), alābu (bottle gourd), vārtāka (egg plant), pālanki (a kind of vegetable) and pūtikā. The Padmapurāņa 102 provides that one who is observing nakta vrata must observe six things, viz. havisya meals, bath, truthful ness, small quantity of food, worship of Agni and sleeping on the ground (not on a cot). The Bhujabala 102 says: all should avoid while observing vrata the use of bell metal (vessel), flesh, masura, gram, kodrava, vegetables, honey and the food cooked in another's house. Harita lays 103 down what should be avoided on the day of vrata: one should avoid on the fast day talk with one guilty of heavy sins, heterodox sectarians and atheists and speak ing what is untrue and obscene. The Sāntiparva says 'one engaged in vrata should not converse with women, sūdras and patita'. The Bșhadyogi-Yājñavalkyasmrti 104 observes: one

Praise of vratas 

should not talk at the time of japa or vrata or homa and the like to women, sūdras, patita, sectarians, a woman in her monthly illness; if there be a failure in the restraint of speech (with these) in japa and the rest, he should recite a mantra addressed to Visnu or remember Visnu who is imperishable. 

The Purāṇas extol, as in the case of pilgrimages, the performance of vratas to the skies. Certain vratas like those to be undergone by a Vedic student had ceased to be in vogue and vratas associated with Vedic sacrifices also had become rare in the centuries before the Christian era. In the grhya and dharma sūtras and in ancient smrtis like those of Manu and Yājñavalkya what were called yratas in the Purāṇas did not occupy any very prominent position. During the early centuries of the Christian era Buddhism and Jainism were influential rivals of the ancient sacrificial system. In order to wean away common people from those two schisms it is very probable that learned followers of the Vedic system hit upon the glorification of vratas and promised heaven and otherworldly and spiritual rewards to those who performed vratas that were com paratively easy and within reach of all instead of sacrifices and also adopted some of the practices of common folks as vratas, e. g. kukkuți-markati-vrata in Bhavisyottara 46. 1-43, Sitala vrata (Vratārka folio 111 b-113 b, N. S. p. 123). The Brahma purāṇa105 says 'the reward that is secured by the worship of the Sun for a single day cannot be secured by hundreds of Vedic sacrifices or by brāhmaṇas to whom the fees stated in the texts are paid'. The Padmapurāņa106 extols Jayantivrata by saying that in the body of the man who performs it all holy places and deities reside. The Garudapurāņa107 quoted by Hemādri states that the Kāñcanapurivrata described by it is more purifying than even the Ganges, Kuruksetra, Kāśi and Puskara. The Bhavisya-purāņa (Uttara 7.1) provides that a man crosses easily the deep ocean of hells by means of the boat of vratas, vpavāsas

and niyamas. In the Mahābhārata108 ( and the Padmapurāņa VI. 53. 4-6) it is stated that the Vedic rites and rites prescribed by Manu cannot be performed in Kaliyuga and that therefore it declares to Yudhisthira something that would be an easy remedy, requiring little wealth and causing little trouble but securing great rewards and that would be the essence of Purāņas, viz. one should not eat on the Ekādasi of both fortnights; he who does not eat food on Ekadasi does not go to hell. About the Ubhaya dvādaśīvrata described in the Bhavisyapurāņa it is said that Prabhāsa,109 Gaya, Puskara, Varanasi, Prayaga or holy places to the east or west thereof, or to the north are not superior or equal to the Kartika vrata. The Anusasana-parva110 proclaims that there is no higher tapas than upavāsa (fasting) or even equal to it and that poor men can secure the rewards of sacrifices by resorting to the upayāsa described. Hemādri quotes two verses on Arkavrata from the Bhavisyapurāņa stating that if a man observes for a year nakta on the 6th and 7th tithis in each fort night he obtains the merit secured by those who perform the Vedic sacrifices called sattras or who observe the vow of speaking the truth. 

In the Varahapurana the question111 asked is 'how can a poor man reach God' and the reply is that he can do so by vratas ___108. श्रुतास्ते मानवा धर्मा वैदिकाश्च श्रुता मया। कलौ युगे न शक्यन्ते ते वै कर्तु मराधिप॥ सुखोपायमल्पधनमल्पक्लेशं महाफलम्। पुराणानां च सर्वेषां सारभूतं वदामि ते॥ एकादश्यां न भुञ्जीत पक्षयोरुभयोरपि । ... एकादश्यां न भुञ्जन्ति न ते यान्ति यमालयम् । पद्म IV. 53. 4 f; these are quoted from महाभारत by हेमाद्रि (वत I. p. 1089). ___109. प्रभासं नाधिक पार्थ न गया न च पुष्करम्। वाराणसी न वा तद्वत् प्रयागमधवापि च। तीर्थानि च ततः पूर्व पश्चिमानि जनेश्वर । सर्वाण्येव नृपश्रेष्ठ उदीचीदिग्भवानि च। म समानि महाबाहो वतान्ते कार्तिकस्य च । हे.

The Lingapurāņa (pūrvārdha 83. 4) provides that one who for a year observes nakta (eating only once in the evening) and worship of Siva on the 14th and 8th tithis in each paksa (fortnight) secures the reward of all sacrifices and reaches the highest goal. The Bhavisya asserts that brāhmanas who have no sacred fires (śrauta or smārta) benefit in this way that gods become pleased with them by (the observance of) vratas, fasts, restrictive rules of conduct and various kinds of gifts, particularly by a fast on special tithis. 

The keynote struck by the Matsya, Brahma and other Purāṇas is how to secure great rewards with little effort. The Brahma-purāņa remarks that by merely taking in Kaliyuga the name of Kesava a man obtains the same rewards that one got in kota-yuga by deep meditation, in Tretā by performing sacrifices and in Dvāpara by worship (of images). The Matsya says: The great sages do not commend sacrifices which involve killing (of animals); those whose wealth is tapas became firmly placed in heaven by making gifts, according to their means, of particles of grains (collected from fields &c.), roots, fruits, vegetables and water vessels and that tapas is superior for several) reasons to sacrifices. The Padmapurāņa reaches the peak of exaggeration when it says 'no one except Hari will be able to recount the merit of him who offers a lamp on the day of Hari in Kārtika with devotion' or 'Visņuyrata is the highest, a hundred solemn Vedic sacrifices are not equal to it'. The Skandapurāṇa112 (quoted by Hemādri on vrata vol. I. pp. 318-321 ) contains a long eulogy of vrata, one verse of which may be cited here 'Gods attained their position through restrictive observances (vratas); they shine forth as stars by virtue of the vratas ( they performed)'. 

There were certain differences between Vedic sacrifices and vratas. The promised reward of most sacrifices was heaven, while Purāņas promised that most vratas would confer tangible benefits in this very life. Further, yratas could be performed by: all, including sūdras, maidens, married women, widows, even prostitutes. 

There were vratas for the brahmaçõrin (called Veda-vratas ) and for the spātaka. These have been already dealt with in H. of Dh. vol. II, pp. 370-374 and pp. 412-415 respectively. That

History of Dharmaśāstra 

(Sec. I, Ch. II 

vratas (in the medieval sense ) existed even in the first centuries before and after the Christian era follows from the Ap. Dh. S. and from the dramas of Kālidāsa, from the Mrcchakatika and the Ratnāyali. The Ap. Dh. S. II. 8. 18 prescribes a vrata for one year which is equal. in its merit to brahmacārivrata for 48 years and Ap. Dh. S. II. 8. 18-19 to Ap. Dh. S. II. 8. 20 prescribe two modes of a vrata to be begun on Tisya (Pusya) naksatra to be observed by a person desirous of prosperity. Vide S. B. E. vol. II, pp. 145– 148. Hemādri (vrata II. .p. 628 quotes Āp. Dh. S. II. 8. 20.3-9), explains the sutras and calls this Āpastambokta Pusyayrata. 

In the Sākuntala (Act. II) the dowager queen (mother of Duşyanta) sends a message that on the 4th day from the date of the message her fast (vrata) would end 113 The Vikramoryasiya (III) appears to refer to a vrata called in later times Rohiņi. candrasayana-vrata (vide Hemādri vol. II. pp. 599-600 ). It may be noted that in the above works royal ladies are described as observing yratas. In the Raghuvamsa Kalidāsa alludes to an Āsidhāra-vrata (XIII. 67). The Mrcchakatika (Act I) speaks of an upavāsa (a vrata) called Abhirupapati which appears to bave been somewhat like the Bhartrprāptiyrata described by Hemādri (vol. I. pp. 1199-1200). The Ratnāvali ( Act I at ond) describes Madanamahotsava which reminds us of the same described in Hemādri (vol. II, pp. 21-24). It appears, however, that the number of vratas in the first centuries of the Christian era was not very large. Gradually, however, the number of vratas increased by leaps and bounds and their total number, as seen from the list furnished at the end of this section, would be in the region of one thousand. One of the earliest digests on tithis and astrological matters in relation to Dharmaśāstra is the Rājamārtanda of king Bhoja (1st half of 11th century A. D.). It mentions only a few vratas (about 24). The next important extant work is the Kștyakalpataru of Laksmidhara (1st half of 12th century A. D.) who mentions in the vratakāņda about 175. A comparatively later work viz. the Vratakālaviveka of Śūlapāņi (1375–1430 A. D.), which discusses the rules about the proper times for observing vratas, mentions only 11 vratas. Hemādri's is the largest published work on vratas, containing as it does

Works on vratas 

about 2200 printed pages in the B. I. edition. It deals with about 700 vratas. This shows that towards the end of the thirteenth century, when foreign invaders had seized the larger part of India and were ruthlessly razing temples to the ground and converting by force and fraud thousands to their faith, the men of the day, both learned and ignorant, were expending vast intellectual labour and huge sums of money on vratas, pilgrimages and śrāddhas, blissfully ignorant of and blind to the political and religious dangers that engulfed them all. 

The vratakośa edited by M. M. Gopinath Kaviraja (in the Sarasvatibhavana series in 1929 ) lists 1622 vratas, but that list is unduly swollen and inflated for various reasons.114 For example, the Astakā-śrāddhas and Anvastaka-śrāddhas are included and have nine numbers assigned to them. There are twelve numbers assigned to Anantavrata because it is performed for twelve months from Mārgaśīrşa, but Hemādri (on vrata vol. II. pp. 667-671 ) treats it as one vrata. Upavāsavrata is given four numbers, the only reference given being Hemādri (vrata) II. p. 509 (only 11 lines from Matsya). Hemādri (vrata II. pp. 748-52, 757 and so on) describes E kabhakta twelve times in each month from Caitra to Phālguna and then on II. p. 863 refers to him who performs Ekabhaktavrata for one year. The Vratakosa gives 13 separate numbers (2 for Ekabhakta and 11 for Eka bhukta, for this latter form there being no authority of Hemādri who calls all the 13 Ekabhaktavrata). Grahaśānti is given five numbers. It is unnecessary to multiply examples. If properly sifted the number would be much smaller than 1000. 

When a person undertakes a vrata he must see to it that he finishes it; for dire consequences are laid down for him who gives it up through heedlessness. Chāgaleya declares115 'when

[Sec. I, Ch. II 

a person, having first undertaken a vrata, does not carry it out, being led away by some desire, he while alive becomes (i. e. is to be treated as) a cāndāla and after death becomes a dog'. In such a case where through greed, infatuation or inadvertence a man is guilty of breaking his vrata, he has to undergo three days' fast and also shave his head and then begin the vrata (the remainder acc. to Nirnayasindhu, the whole of it acc. to Sula pāņi). The Varāhapurāņa states that man who undertakes a vrata on ekadasi day but does not, owing to foolishness, finish it, reaches a very evil state'. 

Death in the midst of a vrata did not deprive the performer of the merit for which he began it. Angiras 116 provides 'if a. person that has begun some religious act for some benefit dies before the rite is finished, he secures the merit that is the reward ( of that act) after his death; Manu so declared'. 

No one should undertake a vrata in the midst of aśauca (impurity on birth and death ). But it is provided by the Visnudharmasutra117 (22.49) that asauca does not affect the king in doing his royal duties, nor those undergoing a vrata in the carrying out of the vrata. Similarly, Laghu-Visnu observes: in the case of vratas, sacrifices, marriages, in śrāddha, homa, worship (of an image ), in japa, impurity does not affect after they are begun, but it affects before they are begun ( i. e. is an obstacle to beginning these after impurity). Yaj. III. 28-29 are similar verses. It is laid down in the śāstras 118 that danger ( to the

Matters not affecting vratas 

observer of vrata ) from all beings, disease, forgetfulness, the command of one's guru do not break a vrata provided these occur only once ( during the period of the particular vrata ). It is provided by the Matsya-purana, Agni and Satyavrata119 that in the case of women that have commenced a vrata of long duration there is no stoppage of the yrata if they have monthly illness in the midst of the vrata or they become pregnant or are delivered of a child and that they should get the rites performed by another as long as they are impure, but physical acts (such as fasting ) may be done by them. There are certain other matters that do not affect the observance of a vrata, viz. (drinking ) 120 water, (partaking of ) roots, fruits and milk and sacrificial offering, the desire ( or command) of a brahmana, the order of one's guru and medicine. Hemādri remarks that the drinking of milk and the rest that follow do not affect vrata if the performer is a woman, a child or one who is in extreme pain. A person observing vrata 121 should eschew all this, viz. anointing the body or the head with oil, chewing tāmbūla, applying sandalwood paste and whatever else would increase physical strength or passion. 

What actions do not detract from the observance of upavāsa will be discussed later. 

A few words about homa may be said here. Women could not offer homa with mantras (Manu IX. 18). Homa could be performed for them through a priest. When no particular substance is specified the āhuti (offering ) into fire is to be of

The Samayapradipa ( folio 4 b) has a long discussion about the fire in which homa is to be made. One who is an āhitāgni (who has established the sacred Vedic fires) should employ the fire established by him when he was married, as laid down by Yāj. (1.97). According to some, the rule of Yāj. applies only to grhya rites that are laid down in the Grhyasūtras and that oven an āhitāgni should employ ordinary fire for his vratas. One who has no smārta fire should also perform vrata homas in ordinary fire by himself or through a priest.

CHAPTER III 

Persons entitled to engage in Vratas, objects desired by means of Vratas, classifications of Vratas and literature on Vratas, 

times for Vratas 

One important matter is that of vratādhikāriņaḥ (persons entitled to engage in a vrata). Persons of all castes including śūdras are entitled to perform vratas. Devala states: 123 there is no doubt that (men of) all varņas are released from sins by observing vratas, fasts and restrictive rules of behaviour and by mortification (lit. heating) of the body. Women are also entitled to perform vratas. In fact the purāṇas and digests prescribe several vratas .for women alone. Manu, Vişņu Dh. S. and soveral purānas provide that a woman cannot perform a separate sacrifice, a separate vrata or a separate fast by herself, she is honoured in heaven by waiting upon her husband. 124 Visnu Dh. S. ( 25. 16 ) 125 further provides that a woman who observes a vrata in which a fast enters while her husband is alive deprives her husband of his life and herself goes to hell. Whatever act of benefit in the other world a woman does without the consent of her father, husband or son yields no fruit to her. 126 The medieval digests interpreted these verses as meaning that before performing a vrata, a maiden has to secure the consent of her father, a married woman of her husband and a widow of her son and that with the consent of the persons specified a woman

could perform an independent vrata for herself. The digests are supported in this view by the sūtra of Sankha-Likhita 127 that it is the rule for women that they should practise vratas, fasts, restrictive observances and worship (or sacrifices ) with the con sent of their husbands. The Lingapurana 128 provides : with the bidding (i.e. permission) of their husbands, women should per form japa, gifts, tapas and all else. Opinion was divided whether a woman could get homa performed through another. About the incapacity of women for mantras,129 vide Manu II. 66, IX. 18 and Yāj. I. 13. The Vyavahāramayukha following Parāśara held that a sūdra could get the homa in adoption130 performed through a brāhmaṇa and that the same rules apply to women and śūdras and therefore a woman could get a homa required in vrata per formed through a brāhmana. Rudradhara (author of Suddhi viveka) and Vācaspati held that a woman and a sūdra have no right to perform homa with Vedic mantras. The Nirnayasindhu131 supports the Vyavahāramayūkha on the question of homa in a vrata to be observed by a woman. But it appears that Nila kantha, author of the Vyavahāramayūkha, was of a different opinion when composing the Prāyaścittamayūkha.132 Vide H. of Dh. vol. IV. p. 78 note 186 on this point. It is provided in the Matsya that a woman who is pregnant or is recently delivered of a child should only observe nakta instead of a fast and a

maiden or other female who is impure (in monthly illness or otherwise) should get her, vrata performed through another, but, whether pure or impure, she may perform bodily acts (such as a fast) by herself (vide Tithitattva pp. 121-122). 

If a person is unable owing to disease or accident or the like to perform a vrata personally he could get it performed through a pratinidhi (a representative). Certain rules were laid down about this. It is stated in the Satyāsādhasrautasūtra 133 there is no pratinidhi (representative or substitute) in the case of the owner (the Yajamūna), the wife, the son, the (proper ) place and time (for an act), the fire, the deity ( to be invoked such as Agni, Indra), a rite and a text (to be prescribed for being employed in a rite)'. All religious acts are arranged in three classes, viz. nitya (obligatory), naimittika (to be performed when a certain nimitta or occasion arises or event happens) and kāmya (per formed out of a desire to secure some object). Vide H. of Dh. vol. IV pp. 60-61 note 150 for further details. The Trikānda mandana134 has the following rules about pratinidhi in these three kinds of acts. "No pratinidhi ( substituto ) is allowed in the cage of kamya rites, a substitute is allowable in the case of nitya and naimittika rites; some recognized a substitute even in a kāmya rito after it is once begun; there is no substitute for ā mantra or the deity or the fire (Garhapatya, Ahavaniya or Dakşiņāgni), a kriyā (such as prayāja) or iśvara (the svāmin or yajamāna); some say that a substitute is not allowed in the caso of (a prescribed) place or time. An agnihotrin can substitute, (if his wife is dead &c.) an image of her made of gold or kušas but a woman cannot proceed with a rite putting forward some

substitute or effigy in place of the husband.' If a person is unable, after undertaking a vrata, to carry it out, he should get it done by a representative. Such representatives are: son, wife, brother, husband, a sister, a pupil, purohita (for daksiņā) and a friend. Paithinasi 135 states that a wife might carry on the vrata undertaken by the husband and the husband may do so for the wife; if both are unable a stranger may carry it out; in this way there is no break of vrata. Kātyāyana136 says:--one who observes a fast for the sake of his father or mother, brother, husband and particularly for his guru secures one hundred-fold merit; if a person observes a fast on Ekādasi in place of his maternal grand-father and the like they and their representative each obtain the full fruit thereof. These rules about pratinidhi apply to men of all varņas.137 

It is somewhat remarkable that the Vratārka quotes from Hemādri138 a passage of the Devīpurāna to the effect that even mlecchas were authorized to perform yratas, if they had faith in them. In the Santiparva (65. 13--25) Indra is made to say to king Māndhātā that even Yavanas, Kirātas, Gāndhāras, Cīnas, Sabaras, Barbaras, Sakas, Andhras and several others should serve their parents, they could perform rites laid down in the Veda, they could make offerings to their (deceased parents), may dig wells (for the use of all people ) and may make gifts to brahmanas.

Another remarkable matter is that the Mahābhārata provides that brāhmaṇas and ksatriyas should not engage in a continuous fast for more than three days and that vaiśyas and $ūdras can observe a continuous fast for two days only and a fast for three days is not laid down for these two classes by those who know dharma. Devala also has a similar provision, 140 

The bulk of the vratas practised in medieval and modern times are kāmya i. e. performed for the purpose of securing some object in this world or sometimes the next world or both. Most of the yratas are really secular though under the garb of religion and, though certain disciplines (such as fast, worship and celibacy, truthfulness) have to be observed, breathe a frankly materialistic attitude; they are meant to appeal to the ordinary human cravings that rule the whole world. The desired objects are legion and it is impossible to set them out in detail. Some idea about them may however be conveyed. The Agnipurāpa mentions dharma (punya), progeny, wealth beauty or good fortuno, virtues, fame, learning, long life, wealth, purity, enjoyment of pleasures, heaven and moksa (release from the round of births and deaths) as the objects to be sought by the observance of vratas. The Kalpataru 141 on vrata says that vrata is the highest means of securing the several lokas (such as Brahmaloka, Sivaloka, Vaikuntha) and the enjoyment of pleasures and triumph; that in Kṛta, Tretā, Dvāpara and Kali ages respectively kings Sujaya, Rāma, Dhanañjaya and Vikrama became lords of the whole world by means of vratas, that Sankara declared to Hari in various treatises that vrata is the one (supreme) observance for man, that though many observ ances are laid down in each yuga they do not come up even to

History of Dharmaśāstra 

(Sec. I, Ch. III 

the 16th part of the observance of vratas, that the virtuous daughter of Vikrama named Vasundharā, residing in the country of Daśārņa, attained mokşa through vratas and that gods, sages, siddhas and others attained highest perfection by means of upayāsas (fasts). 

Classification of vratas: As the vratas to be treated of in this section are almost all self-imposed or voluntary, they may be divided into three classes. The Padmapurāņa 142 observes: 'ahiṁsā ( abstaining from causing injury), truthfulness, not depriving a person of his property by wrongfully taking it, brahmacarya (continence), freedom from crookedness or hypo crisy---these are mental vratas that lead to the satisfaction (or favour) of Hari; eating once only in the day, nakta (eating only once after sunset), fast (for the whole day), not begging (i.e. subsisting on food that one gets without asking for it)-this is physical vrata for human beings; study of the Veda, recounting (the name of) Vispu, speaking the truth, freedom from backbiting these are vratas of speech. 

Another classification can be based on the time for which a vrata may last, i. e. only for a day or a fortnight (pakşa), a month, season, ayana (time of the stay of the Sun in the northern or southern hemisphere), year, or years. A vrata may be for one year or for more years than one or for a person's lifetime. In speaking of vratas performed in a certain month, the question of an intercalary month will have to be considered and will be dealt with in the next section on Kāla etc. Similarly, the matter of tithis occupies a very large place in works on dharmaśāstra and will have to be discussed. The subject of Kāla and muhūrta will be dealt with in the next section. Though tithis properly pertain to that section, they will be dealt with here, since tithis are the most important topic in relation to the various obsery ances that are to be performed throughout a year as their basis. The largest number of vratas are tithi-yratas. It is therefore that Hemādri begins his treatment of individual vratas with tithi-vratas (from part I, p. 335 to part II p. 519) and passes on

III. 312 and as दम्भरहितता by अपरार्क. 

Classifications of vratas 

in order to vāravratas (part II pp. 520-592), naksatrayratas (part II pp. 593–706), Yogavratas (part II pp. 707-717), Karapa vratas (part II pp. 718–726), Sankrāntivratas (part II pp. 727 743), māsavratas (part II pp. 800-857), stuvratas (part II pp. 858-861 ), samvatsarayratas (part II pp. 862-867), prakırnaka (miscellaneous) vratas (part II pp. 867-1002). The Krtyakalpa taru (on vrata) on the other hand begins with vāravratas (pp. 8-34), then deals with tithiyratas (pp. 35-398), naksatra yratas (pp. 399-417), māsavratas (pp. 418-430), sankrāntiyratas (pp. 431-434), samvatsaravratas (pp. 434-451) and prakirna yratas (pp. 452-459). Most of the works on vrata 1420 after dealing with some general matters begin their treatment of vratas with tithiyratas. The Samayapradipa has a different mode of treatment, viz. that it begins with Ganośavratas (i. o. vratas in which Gaņoša is the deity), then with vratas in which the Sun is the deity, then Sivayratas, Visnuvratas and so on. Some vratas are performed not only on a certain tithi, but also require the existence of a certain month or weekday or naksatra or all of these. Another classification may be based on the persons competent to perform vratas; most vratas are meant for all men and women; some like Haritālikā and Vațasāvitri are meant for women alone, some are to be performed by men alone; while there are others to be performed only by kings or ksatriyas or by vaisyas. 

There is an immense literature on vratas. There is no topic of Dharmaśāstra except probably that of tirthayātrā and of śrāddha on which the Purāṇas wax so eloquent as on vrata. Some of the Purāṇas contain thousands of verses on vrata. For oxample, the Brāhmaparya of the Bhavisyapurāņa (in chapters 16-216) contains over 7500 verses and the Uttarakhanda of the samo Purāņa over five thousand verses on vratas; the Matsya purāņa (chapters 54–92 and 95–101) has about 1230 verses on vrata (most of which occur in the Padmapurāņa V chap. 20 ff), the Varāhapurāņa (chap. 39-65) spends about 700 verses and the Vispudharmottara about 1600 verses on vratas. On a modest calculation the Purāṇas contain about twenty-five thousand verses at least on vratas. It is difficult to draw a strict line between Vratas and utsavas; what are calloul utsavas have also an element of religious rites and conversely many vratas have some element of being a festival. In this work I have included

soveral observances which some people may regard as purely atsavas and not vratas at all. 

The topic of vratas is rather inextricably mixed up with discussions on Kāla and tithi. The nibandhas (commentaries and digests) on vratas are numerous. In this section I shall mention works that deal with vratas alone or with vratas in relation to trthis, but not works on kāla in general and muhūrta. This is rather an arbitrary arrangement and it is possible that there would be some repetition and overlapping. A verse in the Kālaviveka of Jimūtavāhana names seven predecessors that had expounded kāla in relation to religious rites, viz. Jitendriya, Sankhadhara, Andhūka, Sambhrama, Harivamsa and Yogloka. Some of these writers must have been earlier than the first half of the 11th century A. D. as in the Malamāsatattva Raghu nandana states that Andhūkabhatta mentions in his work how in sake 955 (1033–34 A. D.) there was on Amāvāsyā Tula sankrānti and the Vrścikasankrānti on the pratipad and again on Amāvāsyā Dhanus-sankrānti. This establishes that Andhūka bhatta wrote his works about 1035 A. D. But the works of all those seven writers on kāla have not yet been discovered. Two other works ascribed to king Bhoja of Dhārā 143 dealt among other matters with kāla and vratas (in the 2nd quarter of the 11th century). One of them, the Rājamārtanda, is available in Mss and, besides expounding the astrological significance of tithis, week days, pakşatras, Yogas, deals (in versos 1136–1292 and 1327-1405) with several yratas and the proper times for them - viz. Ekādaśī, Saptamyarkavrata, Agastyārghyadāna, Sravana dvādaśī, Rohinyaştamī, Haritāli-caturthi, Durgotsava, Kaujā gara, Pretacaturdaśi, Sukharātri, Bhrātr-dyitīyā, Dipadāna, Kārtikasnāna, Māghasnāna, Maghāsaptami, Bhismāstamī, Pusyadvādaśī, Asokāstamı, Caitrāvali, Savitrivrata, Pāşāṇaca turthi, Araṇyaşasthi, Daśabarā, Sankranti. The Rājamārtanda has not so far as I know yet been published, though hundreds of verses therefrom aro quoted in the medieval digests. It is at present the earliest extant work of a nibandha form treating of vratas. Another work dealing with vratas and ascribed to Bhoja is the one cited as Bhūpāla-samuccaya or Bhūpāla-krtya samuccaya, or Krtyasamuccaya on vratas, danas &c. This

Works on vrata relied on 

last work has not yet been unearthed and is found quoted in such medieval digests as the Krtyaratnākara. 

Apart from the Vedic Literature, sūtras, epics, Purāṇas and Rājamārtanda, I mainly rely in this section on vratas on the following works (those that I consulted in ms. form being expressly indicated and the works being arranged in chrono logical order as far as possible): Krtyakalpataru ( portion on vratas) of Lakşmidhara; Kālaviveka of Jīmātavāhana; Hemādri's Caturvargacintāmaņi (on vrata); Samayapradipa of Srīdatta (ms.); Krtyaratnākara of Candaśvara; Kālādarśa of Adityasūri (ms.), Kālanirņaya or Kāla-mādhava and Kāla. nirnayakārikā; Tithiviveka, Vratakālaviveka and Durgotsava viveka of Sūlapāni; Nirnayāmrta of Allādanātha; Varsakriyā. kaumudi of Govindānanda; Kālasāra of Gadādhara; the Tithi tattya, Ekādaśītattva, Janmāstamītattva, Durgārcanapaddhati, Krtyatattva and Vratatattva of Raghunandana, Vrataprakāśa (part of Viramitrodaya) of Mitramiśra (ms. from Anūpa Sanskrit Library) and Samayaprakāśa (part of Viramitrodaya); Samaya mayūkha or Kālamayūkha of Nislakantha; Vratārka of Sankarabhatta (ms.); Tithyarka of Divākara; Daśanirnaya 14 of Hārīta Venkatanātha; Vratodyāpana-kaumudi of Sankara bhatta Ghāre; Vratarāja of Viśvanātha; Puruşārthacintāmaņi of Vignubhatta; Ahalyā-kāmadhenu (ms. in Scindia Oriental Insti tute, 1767-1771 A.D.); Dharmasindhu of Kāšīnātha. Of these the most important for yratas are Kityakalpataru (from which even Homādri, and Krtyaratnākara borrow many passages), Hemādri on vrata, Kālanirnaya of Mādhava, Kștyaratnākara, Varsakriya kaumudi, the works of Raghunandana and the Nirnaya-sindhu. Works like Vratārka and Vratarāja, though exhaustive, borrow verbatim long passages from Hemādri and others. The treatment of vratas in several of the above-mentioned works is often uneven; for example, the Varsakriyākaumudi disposes of the observances of the 1st, 2nd and 3rd tithis in two pages (28-30), while it devotes twenty-two pages to Ekadasi (pp. 42-64). 

It must be emphasized here that this section is concernod with the yratas described or mentioned in works on Dharmaśāstra. Even so the number of vratas is extremely large. No attempt is made here to include all vra!as observed by women or by

primitive tribes or by the illiterate people all over India or con tained in works written in the several regional languages such as Bengali, Hindi or Marathi. The inclusion of such obsery ances would entail an enormous amount of labour, would expand the work to huge proportions and would be beyond the proper scope of the History of Dharmaśāstra. Further, to tabulate all the vratas and festivals of all common people and to study the folk life of villagers, forest-dwellers and mountain inhabitants in the States of the continent of India would be beyond the capacity of a single worker and would require the co-operative effort of a large team of workers spread over years. When done, that work would be a monumental one on the social anthropology of India. In this connection I may mention Prof. B. K. Sarkar's work 'Folk element in Hindu culture' and the paper on a study of vrata rites in Bengal' contributed by Mr. S. R. Das145 to 'Man in India' (1952) vol. 32, pp. 207-245. Some writers have already published works dealing with the observances of common people such as Mrs. Stevenson's 'Rites of the twice-born', Underhill's 'Hindu religious year', B. A. Gupte's Hindu holidays and ceremonials', R. C. Mukerj's Ancient Indian fasts and feasts', Mr. Rigvedi's Marathi work on 'History of Aryan festivals' (ed. of 1924). In these books (except in the last and rarely in Underhill's) texts from Dharmaśāstra are generally conspicuous by their absence. 

Times for beginning Vratas: Apart from the vratas that have to be performed on certain fixed tithis or times, elaborate provisions are made that yratas in general and several other religious rites are to be begun only at certain auspicious times or in certain astrological conditions. A few of these are set out 

145. It should not, however, be supposed that I agree with all the propositions in the above two; for example, the meaning wbich Mr. S. R. Das assigos to Lakşmi in Rg. X. 71. 2 (viz. beauty) is not acceptable to me. I hold that 'Laksmi' there also is the opposite of alaksmi as the word 'bbadrā' applied to Lakşmi suggests and as in Rg. X. 155. 1 the idea of alaksmi is clearly conveyed. I do not subscribe to the view that the idea of a malignant spirit was unknown to the poets of Rgveda times and that they had to go to the aboriginal people for that idea. Note the verses 4* Fery: सख्यानि जानते भदैवां लक्ष्मीनिहिताधि वाचि अ. x. 71. 2; अरायि काणे विकटे गिरि pa Frare i finity Feather E TH I *. X. 155 1. The farthi (VI. 30) explains this verse at length and states that Bhāradvāja destroyed Alaksmi and the Bṛbad-devatā (VIII, 60) says that Rg. X. 71 removes Alaksmi. 

Proper times for vratas 

here by way of sample. Gārgya 146 says 'when Jupiter and Venus have set (i. e. are not observable owing to their being near the Sun in the sky) or when they are in the stage of being called bāla and viddha and in an intercalary month one should not begin a vrata nor perform its udyūpana (the rite of closing a vrata).' The childhood of Jupiter and Venus is a certain period after they set and senility (uğddhatva or vārdhaka) is a certain period preceding their setting. There is no unanimity on the length of these periods and the periods differ in different countries and also depend on whether there is a season of distress or difficulty, but Varāhamihira 147 states the longest provided should be accepted. The Rājamārtanda has several verses on this, one of which may be set out here: Venus 148 is bala for ten days when it rises in the west, but is bāla for three days after rising in the east; Venus is vrddha for one paksa. (15 days) when it rises in the east, but is vrddha for five days before it sets in the west. Gargya observes :149 Venus and Jupiter are (held to be bāla) in the Vindhyas whether in the east or west for ten days, but for seven days in the country of Avanti (of which Ujjayini was capital); in the country of Vanga (Bengal) and among Hūņas (they are bāla) respectively for six and five days. It is further provided in the 150 Devipurāņa that one should not under take any religious act when Jupiter or Venus is in the sign of the Lion. Similarly, Lalla 151 remarks that all (religious) actions are

condemned when done in what is called Gurvāditya (that is when the sun is in the house of Jupiter viz. sign of Pisces and when Jupiter is in the house of the Sun, viz. Lion). The Vratarāja remarks that one is to avoid Jupiter in the Lion sign for religi ous acts only to the north of the Narmadā and elsewhere only in Simhamsa (i. e. the first quarter of the naksatra Pūrvā-phalguni). The Ratnamālā 152 provides that Monday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday are auspicious (confer success) in all (religious) acts; but on Sunday, Tuesday and Saturday only such actions succeed as are expressly prescribed for performance on those days, Bhujabala remarks that Tuesday is unfavourable for all auspicious acts but that it is commended for agriculture, study (of the Sāmaveda) and for battles. 153 

The philosophical discussions on Time and on its division into year, ayana (the Sun's apparent motion in the two regions of the celestial sphere), plus (seasons), māsa (month), paksa (half month,) week, days &c. will be taken up in the next section. But the exact determination of the question as to the day on which a tithivrata is to be performed when the tithi spreads over two days occupies a very large space in works on dharmaśāstra. 

The word tithi by itself does not occur in the Rgveda and the other Vedic Samhitās. But the idea must have been there even in the Rgveda. Amāvāsyā is explained in later works as being of two kinds, viz. Sinīvāli (day on which aināvāsyā is mixed with the 14th tithi) and Kuhū (when amāvāsyā is mixed with the first tithi of the next fortnight). Similarly, Paurņa māsi is of two kinds, Anumati (mixed with the 14th tithi) and Rākā (mixed with the Pratipal of the next paksa). In the Rgveda Sinivāli is 154 raised to the position of a divinity, is described as the sister of the gods, offerings are made to her and she is implored to bestow progeny on the worshippers. The Br. Up. VI. 4. 21 implores Sinivāli and the Aśvins to implant an

embryo in the wife. Rākā also 155 is similarly treated in the Rgveda (II. 32. 4-5 = Atharva VII. 48. 1-2). Rg. X. 59.6 and X. 167. 3 treat Anumati as a deity, prayers are offered to her to enable the worshippers to see the Sun going up and to bestow happiness and she is spoken of in the same breath with Soma, Varuna and Brhaspati. The Vāj. S. prays 156 May Anumati approve to-day of our sacrifice'. It should be noted that the Nirukta (XI. 29) holds 157 a discussion on Anumati and Rākā, viz. the Nairuktas (etymologists) say that Anumati and Rākā are goddesses (wives of gods), while the Yājñikas hold that they are two kinds of Paurņamāsī; it is known (in Sruti) that the first Paurnamāşi is Anumati and the later is Rākā. Similarly, the Nirukta holds a discussion on Sinivāli and Kuhū (XI, 31). The Atharvaveda (VI. 11. 3) mentions Prajāpati, Anumati and Sinivāli together. The word Kuhū occurs in the Atharvaveda and is applied to a deity that is invoked to come to the sacrifice and to bestow on the worshipper wealth and a heroic son. In the Tai. S. I. 8. 8.1 and Sat. Br. IX. 5. 1. 38 mention is made of these four, viz. of Anumati, Rākā, Sinīvāli and Kuhū, as recipients of caru (oblation of boiled rice). How these names were coined in the distant past is an insoluble riddle. Anumati can be derived from root man, but why the tithi of the Full Moon mixed with the 14th tithi was so called is more than anyone can say. Kuhū may be plausibly derived from kuha 'where' (as in Rg. I. 24. 10, X. 40. 2) as the day when the moon is invisible and when primitive people asked in wonder the question where does the moon go! But Rākā and Sinivāli defy attempts at any plausible etymology. Eminent philologists, instead of

admitting ignorance, are not wanting, who following the tradi tions of the very ancient etymologist Yaska (who says in Nirukta II. 1 'na tveva na nirbrūyā), suggest that the word Sinīvāli is made up by combining the Babylonian-Akkadian word "sin' (meaning moon) with Dravidian 'vel' (white light) 158 'Amāyāsyā' (New Moon) is addressed as a deity by itself in Atharva 159 VII. 79 (84) 1-4, the first of which calls upon Amāvāsyā to come to the sacrifice and bestow wealth and a valiant son and the second of which hints at the derivation of the word from 'amā' (meaning together' or 'home') and 'ras' (to dwell). The Sat. Br. 160 remarks "this king Soma i. e. the moon is the food of the gods; when he (the moon) is not seen on this night either in the east or in the west, he comes to this world (i. e. the earth) and enters the waters and the herbs here; he is the wealth of the gods and their food; when he dwells on this night together (with waters and herbs) it (that night) there fore is called 'Amāvāsyā'. The Ait. Br. (40.5) states that on amāvāsyā the moon enters the sun. The Āp. Dh. S. also echoes this idea that on the Amāyāsyā night the Sun and the Moon dwell together (are near each other). So amāvāsyā is so called either because the moon was supposed to dwell together with waters and herbs on the earth that night or because the Moon dwells in the Sun on that night. Darśa has the same sense as amāvāsy, and means the day on which the moon is seen by the sun alone (and by no one else)'. Vide H. of Dh. vol. II, p. 1009 and note 2274. Names are sometimes given by contraries e. g. a fool is called a wise man or a brave person may be called 'timid'. Amāyāsyā may have been called darśa because the moon is not 

158. Vide 'Bhāratakaumudi' (in honour of Prof. R. K. Mukerji) part I. p. 208 for this etymology put forward by Dr. S. K. Chatterji. Such etymologies are based on certaia assumptions for which there is absolutely no evidence whatever, such as the word Vel' being used by the Dravidians thousands of years ago, that the vedic Iodiaas were aware of both words "Sin' (moon) and 'Vel' used by different peoples and could weld them together thousands of years ago and had no word of their own to denote what is meant by Sinivāli.

seen that day (but would be visible the next day). Another tithi that is famous in the Vedic Literature is Astakā 161 (8th tithi after the full moon in any month, but particularly in Māgha) on which offerings were made to the pitrs (departed ancestors). Even in very remote times people could have easily marked the four main phases of the moon, viz. Full Moon, half moon (8th day there after when half of the moon's orb shines), Moon's total absence and 8th day thereafter; and after noting these phases it must not have been very difficult to make close calculations about the periods intervening between the Full moon and the half moon, the New moon and half moon. As a matter of fact the Tai. Br. 162 expressly says that the moon is worn away on the 15th and becomes full on the 15th i. e. before the Tai. Br. it was well known that there were 30 lunar days (tithis) in a lunar month. It is stated in the Sat. Br. 163 "the joints of Prajāpati, while he was engaged in creating beings, became loose (or collapsed); the samvatsara is indeed Prajapati and the joints of it (of samvatsara) are the two junctions of day and night, Paurņamāsı, Amāyāsyā and the beginnings (first days) of the seasons'. The words Paurpamāsī and Amāvāsyā occur very frequently in the Atharvaveda, the Tai. S. and other Vedic texts, though the two words do not occur in the Rgveda. The Atharvavoda says 164 that Paurņamāsi was the first among days and nights and was worthy of sacrifice. The Ait. Br. 165 has an interesting passage: "they

(wise men) say that when a sacrificer dwells near his sacrificial fire, that is due to his thought that the gods will partake of his offerings, since they do not eat the offering of a sacrificer who does not abide by certain observances'. The opinion of the sage Paingi is that the sacrificer should stay near his sacrificial fires (or fast) on the previous Paurpamāsī (i. e. Paurņamāsī mixed with 14th), while the opinion of Kausītaki is that he should do 80 on the later one (i. e. the Paurņamāsi mixed with prati pad). The previous Paurņamāsī is called Anumati, the later one is called Rākā, while the previous Amāvāsyā is called Siniyāli and the later one is called Kuhū. That is the tithi (on which a religi ous rite should be performed), it is the one, being associated with which the sun sets and the sun rises.” This passage shows that differences of opinion had arisen long before the time of the Ait. Br. as to on what day a particular rite associated with a certain fixed tithi was to be performed when the tithi was spread over two days. There are references in Tai. S. and the Brāhmaṇa literature which show that in those ancient days the duration of tithis and therefore the actual position of the moon could not sometimes be very accurately determined beforehand. A man about to perform an işti on New Moon (daršeştı) does certain acts that are done on the day previous to amāvāsyā such as using the sour curds from last night's milking for coagulating the sacri ficial food (i. o. milk), separating the calves from the cows in the afternoon with a palūsa twig; and taking some husked rice, he thinks, owing to cloudy weather or through miscalculation, that the moon would not be seen in the sky the next morning, does not actually set apart a few handfuls of husked rice (meant as nirvāpa for the gods) or gets them apart, then the next day the moon is seen in the sky (i. e. the next day is really 14th tithi instead of amāvāsyā). It is then prescribed that he has to perform an expiatory rito called Abhyuditesti. Vide Tai. S. II. 5.5.1-2 and Sat. Br. XI. 1. 4.1-% quoted 166 below.

Word tithi in ancient Literature 

67 

The word tithi does not occur in the Samhitās, but it occurs in the Ait. Br. cited above and in the gļhya and dharma sūtras. 

The Gobhilagrhyasūtra 167 when prescribing a day for the setting up of sacred fires mentions the coincidence of an auspici ous tithi and nakşatra and in another place refers to the worship of the lord of the tithi and of the nakşatra and of the tithi itself. The Kausītaki-gļhya (I. 25) speaks of offerings to the tithi on which a child was born and prescribes that the dedication of ponds, wells and tanks was to be made in the bright half of a month and on an auspicious tithi (V.2). 

The Nirukta 168 while deriving the word atithi applied to Agni in Rg. V. 4.5 gives two explanations, one of which is one who approaches the houses of others on special tithis'. Pāṇini furnishes no sūtra relating to the word tithi, but it is possible to argue that the affix titha which he mentions in explaining words like 'bahutitha '169 was a relic of the word tithi. Patañjali expressly mentioned Paurņamāsi tithi. Vide ‘India Antiqua', the volume of studies presented to Dr. J. Ph. Vogel pp. 109-11% for Prof. Edgerton's paper on affix 'titha'. From the above discussion it would be clear that the ideas and divergences of views about the proper tithis for certain religious acts existed in the Vedic times (at least before Ait. Br.) three thousand years

ago and that the word tithi itself must be held to have been in use about 800 B. C., if not earlier still.170

Tithi is defined as the time or period required by the moon to gain twelve degrees on the sun. As the Sūryasiddhānta states "tithi is the lunar day in which the moon leaving the sun (at the last moment of Amāvāsyā), traverses twelve degrees (bhāgas) towards the east every day.'171 The moon's motion is irregular and therefore the moon traverses twelve degrees sometimes in 60 ghatikās, sometimes in more (up to about 65) and sometimes in less ghatikās up to about 54. The result is that one unit day may be co-terminous with one tithi, but often a unit day has two tithis i. e. in the morning it may be the 6th tithi, but in the afternoon, evening and night it may be the 7th. It is possible that in a single civil day (from sunrise to sunrise) there may be three tithis 0.g. on Monday morning there may be only two ghatikās left of the 6th tithi, then the 7th tithi may be only 56 ghatikās in duration and then the 8th may follow for the last two ghatikās of that unit day. Conversely, a single tithi may touch three days. For example, the last two ghatikās of Monday may be the first two ghatikās of the 6th tithi, then the 60 ghatikās of Tuesday may be occupied by the 6th tithi and two more ghatikās (the last) of the 6th tithi may spread on to Wednesday morning. A unit day which spreads over three tithis is declared by the Rājamārtanda to be very holy 172 (or auspicious); while on the other hand a tithi touching three days is said to be inauspicious for marriage, for marching on an invasion, for an auspicious religious act or an act meant to

Tithi-vrddhi and tithi-kşaya explained 

advance prosperity. 173 If a tithi begins immediately before sunrise or its beginning coincides with sunrise and ends after the following sunrise the name of the tithi (as pratipad, dvitīyā or so on as the case may be) is coupled with both divasas (civil days) involved, so that two tithis of the same denomination appear one after another. This is called vṛddhi of the particular tithi. If a tithi begins sometime after sunrise on one morning and ends before sunrise on the following day it cannot be coupled with any day and is therefore deleted or omitted in the pancānga (almanac) and there is lithi-kşıya. As a tithi is normally shorter than the civil day kşaya occurs more frequently than vṛddhi. 

From the words of the Gobhilaghya quoted above it follows that long before the days of that work the several tithis were deemed to have certain deities as their lords (or presiding deities). Among the earliest extant enumerations about tithipatis (lords of tithis) is that in the Brhatsamhita of Varaha mihira (chap. 98. 1-2) which sets them 174 out as follows (the tithis and their lords being mentioned in order):-1st Brahmā, 2nd Brahmā, 3rd Hari, 4th Yama, 5th the moon, 6th Kārtikeya, 7th Indra, 8th Vasus, 9th Nāgas, 10th Dharma, 11th Siva, 12th Savit;, 13th Madana, 14th Kali, 15th Viśvedevas and of Amāyāsyā the pitrs. He further says that one should do on those tithis the acts that are appropriate to the lords of those tithis. It appears that other writers differed somewhat from Varāhamihira, 8. g. the Ratnamālā sets 175 out the lords of tithis according to the Purānas as follows:-1st Agni, 2nd Brahma, 3rd Girijā, 4th Gaņoša, 5th Nāga, 6th Višākha (Skanda), 7th the Sun, 8th Siva, 9th Durgā, 10th Yama, 11th Vispu, 12th Hari, 13th Madana, 14th Siva, 15th the Moon.

states what tithis are specially dear to what gods such as 8th and 14th to Siva, 4th to Ganesa, 9th to Capdikā. The Garuda (I. 137. 16-19 ) and Nārada-purāņa (I. 56. 133–135) specify what deities are to be worshipped on the tithis from the first to 

15th. 

Varāhamihira divides tithis into five 176 groups, viz. Nanda, Bhadrā, Vijayā or Jayā, Riktā and Pūrnā and states that on those tithis the acts that are appropriate or suited to the lords of the tithis should be done and become crowned with success and the fruits of actions done on these five classes of tithis yield results similar to their names. The same applies to karaņas and muhurtas. The result is Nandā tithis are 1st, 6th, 11th; Bhadrās are 2nd, 7th, 12th; Vijayās 3rd, 8th, 13th; Riktās are 4th, 9th and 14th; Pūrņās are 5th, 10th, 15th. This is also brought out in the Atharvapa Jyotisa, which also prescribes what should be done or not done on the tithis from the 1st to the 15th and provides that certain combinations of tithis and certain weekdays yield success and all rewards, viz. Nandā tithi on Friday, Bhadrā on Wednesday, Jayā on Tuesday, Riktā on Saturday, and Pūrpā on Thursday. 

The Tithitattva (pp. 27-28) quotes a long passage specifying the loss a man suffers by eating fifteen specified things from the 1st to the 15th tithi respectively. The Nirnayasindhu (p. 32) quotes verses from Muhūrta-dīpikā and Bhūpāla 177 (i. e. Bhoja) which specify the edibles and certain actions that are respec tively to be given up on the tithis from the first to the 15th and on amāvāsyā. On the other hand, Bhavisyapurāņa (Brāhmaparva 16. 18-20) quoted by the Kalpataru on vrata p. 35 specially recommends the eating of certain things on each of the 15 tithis from pratipad (the first) viz. milk, flowers (on 2nd), anything

The Vāmanapurāpa 178 (14. 48–51) prescribes what actions should not be done on the groups of tithis called Nanda &c., on certain week days and on certain naksatras. 

The method of reckoning time by tithis is a very early one and is indigenous to India. Though Western scholars have from time to time put forward various theories about the so-called Greek influence on Indian astronomy and astrology and about the Indian Naksatra system being borrowed from the Chinese (Biot) or from the Babylonians (Weber ) or from the Arabs (Sedillot), no western scholar has had the courage, so far as I know, of alleging that the system of tithis is not indigenous but is borrowed from some non-Indian source. The theories about Greek influence will be briefly dealt with in the next section. 

Vedic (and Smrti) injunctions are of two kinds, (1) those that urge a person to do a thing such as 'one should fast on Ekādaši in both paksas', (2) those that dissuade a person from doing something as in 'one should not eat food on Ekādaśī', Tithis are thus an anga of the two kinds of injunctions. Accord ing to Garga,179 tithi, naksatra and vāra (week day) are a means of punya (merit) and pāpa (demerit, sin) by being subsidiary to the principal rite prescribed, but they are not able to produce the above result independently.180 

Tithi is of two kinds, 181 pārņā (complete or full) and sakhandā. When a single tithi covers the whole day from sun

rise for sixty nādikās (or ghatikās) the tithi is purnā, i. e. the tithi begins exactly at sunrise and ends with the next sunrise and is exactly 60 ghatikās in extent. All others than this are sakhanda; these latter again are of two kinds suddhā and viddhā (pierced by or intermixed with another).182 A śuddhā tithi is one that extends from sunrise to sunset or (in the case of some tithis like sivarātri) up till midnight; other sakhaqda tithis are called viddhā. Vedha is of two kinds, morning vedha and evening vedha; the former generally occurs when after six ghatikās from sunrise a tithi touches or gets merged with the next tithi, while the latter (evening vedha) generally occurs when a tithi touches another tithi six ghatikās before sunset. In the case of certain tithis the period prescribed may exceed six ghatikās. 

When the tithi in question is 60 ghatikās in extent and begins with sunrise (i. e. when it is pūrņā) there is no difficulty at all. When a tithi is śuddhā in the sense given by the Dharmasindhu then also there is generally no difficulty. Some general rules have to be kept in mind. Sruti says 183 'forenoon is for the gods, midday for men and afternoon for pitrs'. Manu (IV. 152) says: one should carry out morning duties, decorating the body, bath, brushing the teeth, applying collyrium to the eyes and worship of gods in forenoon alone'. Therefore all religious acts prescribed for being performed by day on certain tithis for gods must be begun in the morning even if the tithi is mixed with another on that day, but all vratas to be performed in the evening or night have to be performed on the tithi exist ing in the evening or night even 184 though it may be mixed up (viddha) with another tithi. Another matter to be noted is that in both halves of the month all tithis may affect the previous tithi and following tithi by three muhūrtas (i. e. six nādis or ghatikās).185 Some tithis produce vedha by a larger number of ___182. आदित्योदयवेलाया आरम्य षष्टिनाडिकाः । तिथिस्तु सा हि शुद्धा स्यात्सार्वतिथ्यो द्ययं विधिः । इति कालमाधवीयधृतनारदीयात् । सा हि सुद्धा सैव शुद्धा नान्येत्यर्थः । ति. त. pp. 87-88; FTATUI F armaru: i faca CVEI FIIETET a que \#Tatu angry I, 56. 154.

ghatikas e. g. the 5th makes sasthi affected by twelve nādis, 10th makes 11th viddhā by 15 nādis, &c. Viddhā tithis are in some cases fit for performing religious acts, sometimes they are not. All rites 186 of the śrauta or smārta type, vrata, dāņa and every other act enjoined by the Veda do not yield proper reward as long as there is no determination of the tithi proper for it. That tithi which covers up the time (such as morning), noon, whole day &c. at which a religious act is prescribed to be done is the proper one for 187 that act. The first principle to 188 remember is that Kāla (the time prescribed for a rite) is not a mere detail, but it is a nimitta (an occasion) on the happening of which a rite is to be performed and that therefore what is done at some time other than the prescribed one is practically as good as not done. There is a text of the Tai. S. II. 2. 5. 4 which indicates this principle about Kāla. It says 'that man is cut off from the heavenly world, who desiring to perform the darśa pūrpamāsa rites transgresses the time of full Moon or Now Moon'. Hemādri 189 strongly emphasizes the performance of rites

on the proper time and states that a gaupakāla is resorted to for escaping from the censure of śistas or for the solace of one's mind or because there is no other alternative. If a tithi can be had on two days and at the required time or if it does not exist on both days at the time required or it extends only up to a part of the time for which it is required, then the decision is arrived at, as a general rule, by what is called 'yugmavākya' to be cited below. 190 Suppose, for example, that a vrata is to be performed at noon on a certain tithi, then that tithi may exist at noon on two days or suppose that the tithi begins one or two ghatikās after noon and ends on the next day one or two ghatikās before noon, then the decision as to which tithi (whether pūrva-viddhā or para-viddhā) is proper for the act would have to be decided as a general rule by the Yugmavākya. The Yugmavākya may be translated as follows: "The pairs (or combinations) of the following tithis lead to great reward, viz. of the 2nd and 3rd tithis, of the 4th and 5th, of the 6th and 7th, of the 8th and 9th, of the 11th and 12th, of the 14th with pūrpimā (Full moon tithi) and of Amāvāsya with the 1st: the reverse (i. e, combinations or pairs of other tithis) results in great loss; such combinations destroy all former (accumulated) merit. In these verses there are seven pairs and they are mutually applicable. The question may be asked: on what tithi a vrata prescribed for the 2nd tithi should be performed if the 2nd is combined with the first on one day (that is, it is pūrvaviddhā) and is also combined with the 3rd on the next day (i. e. it is para viddhā). The reply is: as a general rule the day on which the 2nd is combined with the 3rd tithi should be the proper one for the dvitiyāvrata and not the day on which 2nd tithi is combined with the first. Similarly, in the case of a yrata to be performed on tṛtīyā, if the 3rd tithi occurs on one civil day combined with the 2nd and on the next day it is combined with the 4th, then the proper day as a general rule for a trtīyā-vrata is the one on which the 2nd and 3rd tithis are in combination and not the other day on which the 3rd and 4th tithis combine. The result of this passage is that combinations of 1st and 2nd tithi, of the 3rd and 4th, of 5th and 6th, of 7th and 8th, of the 9th and 10th, of the 10th and 11th, of 12th and

13th, of 13th and 14th, of Purnima with the first and of Amavasya with 14th are generally excluded as improper.191 

It may be stated here that the rules laid down in the above verses (of yugmavākya) are riddled with exceptions. Some say that these rules apply only to tithis of the bright half and not to those of the dark half. But many works such as Aparārka (p. 216), Kalanirnaya (p. 172), Vratakālaviveka (P.O. vol. VII. p. 87), Nirnayasindhu (p. 18) hold that the passage applies to tithis of the dark half also, since the express mention of Amāvāsyā in combination with pratipad is an indication in that direction. It would be noticed that the yugmavākya (oven though held to be applicable to the dark half) does not refer to the first tithi of the dark half, the 10th and 13th tithis of both halves. Their combinations with the preceding or following tithis will be governed by express texts where available and by other considerations in other cases, such as the verse 'in the bright half that tithi should be preferred which exists at the time the sun rises and, in the dark half, that tithi should be preferred which exists when the sun sets.' 192 Another important rule is that where there are express texts prescribing a particular com bination of viddhā tithis as more appropriate for a vrata or other

The कालादर्श (folio 9a) ascribes the verses to पैठीनसि. They are the same as राजमार्तण्ड folio 69 band 70a, verses 1123-24 (ABORI vol. 36p 309). The समयमदीप (folio 7 b) explains these verses at great length and remarks 'अयं च युग्मादिविधिरहोरात्रसाध्योपवासादेकर्माण तिथिद्वैधे सति सर्वत्र मोद्धव्यः। देवपूजादावपि दिनद्वये विहितपूर्वाह्नादिगामितिथिलाभे सति । यदा त्वेकस्मिन्नेव दिवसे विहितकाललाभः तदा तत्रैव कर्म न तु व्यस्तनिन्दाश्रवणात्तत्रापि युग्मादरः ।'. The कालविवेक of जीमूतवाहन discusses these verses at great length (pp. 475-502) and concludes 'यत्त विष्णुधर्मोत्तरवचन-सा तिथिस्तदहोरात्रं यस्यामम्युदितो रविः। तया कर्माणि कुर्वीत वासवृद्धी न कारणम् ॥-तदयुग्मतिथिविषयमेव । ... तस्मादुभयदिने प्राप्ती कुत्र क्रिया इति सन्देहे युग्मतिथिषु युग्मवचनं, अयुग्मास तु वृद्रिहासादिवचनम् ।' pp. 501-502.

religious rite, that express rule prevails and not the rule derived from this yugmavākya.193 For example, it is laid down in the very place (where the yugmavākya occurs) that the 6th tithi, 8th tithi, amāvāsya and the 13th of the dark half are to be preferred (for religious rites) when in combination with the following tithis (i. e. 7th, 9th, 1st of bright half and 14th of dark half respectively) and others (than those mentioned in the first half such as the 7th, 9th) are to be preferred when combined with those preceding them.194 The application of special considera tions may be further illustrated by the following. The same tithi may be preferred if pārzaviddhā'in one vrata and as para viddhā in other cases owing to the difference in the deities of the vratas. For example, Skandaşasthi is preferred as pūrvaviddhā, but Mandārasasthi is preferred as paraviddha (because the deity is Mandāra and not Skanda). Sometimes, although the devatā is the same, it will have to be pūrvaviddhā and sometimes paraviddhā as in the Vinayaka-vrata which requires mid-day as the proper time. If the 4th exists at midday and then is mixed up with 5th, but did not exist at midday the previous day, then 4th mixed with 5th will be preferred; but if mixed with the 3rd before noon and not mixed with 5th at time of midday, 4th mixed with third will be preferred. Sometimes it depends on the fact whether it is bright or dark fortnight. Sukla pratipad will be preferred if pūrvaviddhā, but kļşņa pratipad will be pre ferred as uttaraviddhā. The rites for pitrs are not governed by yugma-vākya. The gļhya-parisista provides that the pitss attend on that tithi which exists at the time when the sun sets ; that tithi and afternoon are assigned for the pitrs by Brahmā himself.195 Sometimes even a combination not approved by yugmavākya has to be accepted for the performance of a rite e. g. when astamī with Rohini naksatra exists (in Krşnajanma vrata) the fast should be observed on that Astami, though it may be combined with 7th tithi (and not on 9th as yugmavākya

requires).1% Sometimes, even though a tithi be pūrņā, it is passed over in favour of a viddhā one.191 Suppose there is Ekādaśī in the bright half from sunrise to sunrise on a certain day and there is Ekādaśī on the next day for two ghatikās, then there is Dvādaśī for 59 ghaţikis in extent; thus trayodasi comm ences the day after just one ghaţikā after sunrise. According to this verse of Pracetas there is to be no upavāsa on the Ekādasi, though it is pārņā, but the fast will be observed on Drādasi, and the pāraṇā in order to be celebrated on dvādaśī will have to be during the first ghatikā of the third day from ekādasi or earlier. But if the Drādaśī in this case be only for 55 ghatikās, trayodaśī will begin three ghatikās before sunrise; if pāraņā be done at sunrise it will be on the 13th and not on the 12th. In this latter case, according to Pracetas, the Upavāsa will have to be on the pūrņā Ekādaśī in order that the piraņā may be on 12th. It has to be further remembered that the positive prescrip tion about celebrating a vrata or the like on the fixed tithi is governed by the yugmavākya, but the rules forbidding the partaking of oil, meat or the like on the fixed tithi apply for the whole of that day198 and that tithi, whether it is 65 ghatikās and extends over three days or is only 55 ghatikās and extends over two days only. For explaining the words "eka dasyām nirāhāraḥ' from Varāha-purāņa ( 39. 32 ) the Ekādasi tattva (pp. 3-4) states that one is to fast not inerely for the time that the Ekādaśī lasts on a week-day but for the whole of the week day on which Ekadasi falls and it applies the reason ing contained in Jai. VI. 2. 19-20 (called Kalañjādhikarana). If the vrata is such that some items in it are to be done by day and some at night, then that vrata must be observed on that tithi which exists by day as well as at night and in such a case

the yugmavākya has no application. Vide p. 72 and note 184 above. In certain cases where the vrata has several iterns extend ing over the whole day or a large part of it, the tithi at the time of sunrise even if it be only for a ghaţikā is declared by some texts to be sakalā (pārņā ) for purposes of both gifts and vratas.199 

The Kālā darśa propounds the strange 200 theory based on Gobhila's words that the shortening and lengthening of the tithis is due to the piety and sinfulness of men and divides tithis into khurra (of proper extent, 60 ghatikās), darpa (more extensive than 60ghatikās) and himsra or himsa (of lesser extent than 60 ghatikās). The Rajamzrtanda has the same 201 division and remarks that when the tithi is either kharva or darpa (and they are viddhā.) then a rite is to be done on the later tithi (the proper tithi joined to the next one) and in the case of the shorter tithi (if it is viddha) one should prefer the former (i. e. the day on which the proper tithi is joined to an earlier one).202 The Varsa

kriyā-kaumudi ascribes a similar verse to Ušanas and remarks that it is opposed to the dicta of many such sages as Dovala and must be restricted only to Darśaśrāddha forming as it does a syntactical whole with certain yerses of the Chandogaparisista (which it quotes). 

A general rule is stated in some works that when the full moon which is in the lunar mansion that gives the name to a month is in conjunction with Jupiter that tithi has the word mahā prefixed to it. For example, the Paurpimā of Kārtika would be called Mahikartiki if the Moon and Jupiter are both in the Křttikās (Pleiades) on that tithi. The Rāja mārtanda and Bhavisyapurāņa provide that a bath on the Mahācaitrī and (on the remaining eleven paurnimās with prefix mahā) in certain holy places yields great rewards, viz. bath at Prayāga on Mahāmaghi, on Mahāphālguns in the Naimisa forest, on Mahācaitrī at Salagrāma, on Mahavaisakhi at Mahādvāra, on Mahājyaisthi at Purusottama, on Mahasādhi at Kanakhala, on Mahāśrāvani at Kedara, on Mahābhādri at Badarl, on Mahāśvini at Kubjāmra, on Mahākārtiki at Puskara, on Mahāmārgaśīrşi at Kānyakubja, on Mahāpausi at Ayodhyā 203 

There are long lists of actions forbidden on certain tithis. A few passages may be cited here. Devala 204 says 'on the 15th, the 14th and particularly on the 8th one should avoid oil, meat, sexual intercourse and the use of a razor.' The Nāradiya provides

Savitri-vrata. 

The Mahabharata 205 prescribes how to set about a vrata. "Taking in one's hand a copper vessel full of water and turning one's face to the north one should undertake the upavāsa, or whatever else he resolves in his mind to undertake as a yrata.' Devala 206 also says 'without taking food (the previous night), after taking a bath and having performed ūcamana (ceremonial sipping of water) and after having declared before the Sun and other devatās (his intent) a person should perform a vrata'. The Varāhapurāna 207 sets out the formula of sankalpa ‘after passing the 11th tithi without any food, I shall partake of food the next day, O lotus-eyed one (Visnu), O Acyuta, be thou my refuge'. The sankalpa is to be generally made in the case of a fast208 or vrata in the morning; the first fifth part of a day comprising three ghatikās is called morning. Even when a tithi does not

begin in the morning (but begins in the afternoon) the sankalpa has to be made in the morning provided a vrata is to be perform ed on that tithi though it be viddhā. If no sankalpa is made the person secures very little benefit from the vrata 209 and half the merit is lost. 

It is now time to turn to individual vratas on the several tithis. First comes the pratipad-vrata. 

It will be shown in the next section how in ancient and medieval times the month in which the year began was different at different times and in different countries. We shall begin with the pratipad of the month of Caitra, shall take the month as ending with amāvāsyā (amānta) and set out from Caitra the important vratas and festivals in each month and the tithis therein, and the rest will be entered in the list of vratas appended to this section on yratas. 

In those parts of India (such as the Deccan) where the year begins with Caitra, the first tithi is observed with some pomp and religious ceremony. Most of the medieval digests such as Kalpataru (Naiyatakāla pp. 377–382), Hemādri (on vrata vol. I. pp. 360–365), Krtyaratnākara (pp. 103-110), Vratarāja (pp. 49-53) quote from the Brahmapurāna the rites of the beginning of the year on the first tithi of Caitra bright half. That Purāna 210 states that Brahmā created the world on the first day of the bright half of Caitra at sunrise, and started the reckoning of time. On that tithi a mahāśānti (propitiatory rite) destroying all untoward occurrences and sins should be offered and first Brahmā should be worshipped with the well-known upacāras and then the other gods with mantras preceded by om and the word namaḥ (om namo Brahmaņe tubhyam), to all divisions of time from the minutost to yugas and to daughters of Daksa and lastly to Vişnu, then honour brāhmaṇas with food and fees, give presents to relatives and servants, homa should be offered to Agni called Yavistha, special food should be prepared and a great festival should be celebrated. The Bhavisyapurāņa says

Caitraprati pad-vrata 

that since it was declared by Brahma to be the best among tithis and thus placed in the first place it is called Pratipad. On Caitra pratipad there is worship of the lord of the year, viz. the lord of the week-day 211 on which pratipad falls, arches and banners should be raised by each householder, one should anoint one's body with oil and have a bath, one should eat leaves of the nimba tree (that are bitter) and should hear from the reciter of the calendar the name of the year (saka or samvat), its lord and the deities that would be the ministers for the year, the governing deities of all corns and fluids &c. Even in these days priests go about in the Deccan to the houses of their patrons and read from the pancānga (almanac) the details about the lord of the year &c. set out above, people raise a pole with silk cloth at top covered with a silver or brass pot, offer worship to the pole with sandalwood paste, flowers &c. and eat nimba leaves. This latter is done even in Saurastra, though the people employ samvat reckoning. 

The rule is that the pratipad to be celebrated is that which exists at the time of sunrise. If pratipad exists at sunrise on two days, then the earlier of the two is to be chosen or if there be no pratipad at sunrise on any day then the one which is pūrva viddhā should be chosen. For example, if there is amāvāsyā for four ghatikās after sunrise, then there is pratipad for 56 ghatikās and one ghaţikā more on the next day, then the pratipad though affected by amāvāsyā will have to be chosen for the beginning of the year and not the pratipad intermixed with second tithi the next day. If Caitra be an intercalary month then 212 the opinion of many writers is that the pratipad of the intercalary month should be held to be the beginning of the year. The Samayamayūkha holds that when Caitra is an intercalary month the year and spring commence with it, but the ceremonial bath with oil and listening to the recital of the saka year should

be done in the pure month. The 213 Dharmasindhu makes a difference by saying that the ceremonial bath with oil should be taken on the occasion of the commencement of the new year and repeating the name of the new year should be done on the first day of the intercalary month, but the raising of the pole, eating of nimba leaves, listen ing to the recital of the almanac should be done in the pure month. In popular belief caitra-śuddhapratipad is one of the 34 most important muhurtas (auspicious days) of the year. The Sāmrājya-laksmīpithika (pp. 128-133) gives a very elaborato description of the great festival on caitra-buddha first performed by a king or a chieftain or a zamindar owning several villages. 

The next important tithi in Caitra is the 9th in the bright half on which is observed the Rāmanavamīyrata and the celebration of the birth of Rāma, 7th avatāra of Visnu. The principal works on which reliance is placed in Hemādri (on vrata vol. I. pp. 941-946), V. K. K. (pp. 523-529), Tithitattva (pp. 59-62), Nirnayasindhu (pp. 83-86) and other digests are the Agastya-samhitā and Rāmārcanacandrikā of Anandavanayati, pupil of Mukundavanayati. It is somewhat remarkable that the Krtyakalpataru on vrata does not deal with this. The Rāma cult appears to have become popular later than the Krsņa cult. Though the Amarakosa gives Vişnu, Nārāyana, Krsna, Vasudeya, Devakinandana and Dāmodara as synonyms, it does not mention Rāma (Dāśarathi), but mentions Rāma only as a synonym of Haladhara. Here only a brief treatment of Rāma navami can be attempted. The Rāmārcanacandrikā and Vratāska (folio 173a) expressly provide that all persons including even cāņdālas can observe Rāmanavamiyrata (they have adhrkāra). 

It is stated in the Agastyasamhitā 214 that Rāma was born at noon on the 9th of the bright half of Caitra, when Punarvasu asterism was occupied by the Moon and both the Moon and

These astrological details about the birth of Rāma are in line with those in some editions of the Rāmāyana (except those of Gorresio and some others). Vide my paper on this in the Journal of the Oriental lastitute, Baroda, vol. I. pp. 1-5,Rāmanavamivrata 

Jupiter were in conjunction and when five planets were in their ucca (exaltation), when the zodiacal sign rising on the eastern horizon was Karkataka (Cancer), and when the Sun was in the sign of Mesa (Aries). The Kālanirnaya of Madhava (pp. 229– 230) lays down the following. When navami is spread over two days, then, if there is navami at noon only on the earlier of the two days, the vrata should be performed on that day. If there is navami at noon on both days, or if there is no navami at noon on any day, then the vrata should be performed on navami mixed with daśami (and not on navami mixed with astamī). 215 If the 9th tithi is conjoined to Punarvasu asterism that day, that tithi is most holy. Even when there is conjunction of astami, navami and Punarvasu, still the vrata should be on the next day (i. e. on navami with daśami). There are further minute rules and differences on this which are passed over here. 

It is stated that the Rāmanavamīvrata is nitya (obligatory) for all, while others say that it is obligatory only for devotees of Rāma and kāmya (optional) for those that desire special rewards (such as removal of sin, mukti or release from samsāra). The Agastya-samhitā 216 remarks 'This (vrata) is a course prescribed for all and it is the sole means of worldly happiness and mukti. Even a person who is impure or very sinful, having performed this best of vratas, is honoured by all and he becomes as if he were Rāma himself. That wretched man who eats food on Rāma navami suffers torments in the terrible hells called Kumbhīpāka. If a man fasts on a single Rāmanavami all his objects are fulfilled and he is released from all sins. The Agastyasambitā further prescribes on that day (on which Rāma was born) vrata in the form of a fast should always be performed and on that day the devotee intent on Rāma worship should keep awake at night, sitting on the ground'. The use of the word 'sada' (always) shows that the vrata is obligatory. Others say that the texts promise such rewards as removal of sin and therefore it is

kāmya. The conclusion of many works (like the Nirņayasindhu and the Tithitattva) is that this vrata is both kāmya and nitya according to the Mimāṁsā maxim of 'samyogaprthaktva '217 (Jai. IV. 3.5-7). In the section on 'Agnihotra' the Veda says 'he makes an offering of curds in the fire'; there is another sentence in the same, viz. 'one who desires bodily vigour should make an offering of curds in the fire'. The meaning is that curds being separately mentioned in two different sentences which are both independent, homa with dadhi is both nitya and kāmya. 

The procedure of Rāmanavamivrata as set out in H. V. I. pp. 941-946. N. S. pp. 83–86, T. T. pp. 59-62, K. T. V. pp, 96-98, Vratarāja pp. 319-329, Vratārka (folios 172–182 ), may be briefly described as follows:-The devotee should take a bath on the 8th tithi in the bright half of Caitra, perform his sandhyā prayer and should invite a brāhmaṇa learned in the Veda and śāstras and devoted to Rāma worship and knowing the procedure of Rāma mantras, should honour him and make a request 'I shall make a gift of the image of Rāma'. Then he should give oil to the brāhmana for anointing his body, make him bathe, make him wear white garments and flowers, should offer him a dinner containing sāttvika food and should himself partake of the same food and constantly think of Rāma. On that day he and the ācārya honoured by him should go without food at night, should listen to the stories of Rāma the whole day and should himself sleep and make the ācārya sleep on the ground (not on a cot). The next morning he should get up, bathe, perform his sandhyā, should construct a brilliant mandapa with four doors and decked with arches, banners and flowers. The eastern door should be decked with conch, wheel and (an image of) Garuda, bow and arrows, the western one with mace, sword and armlets and the north with lotuses, svastika signs and blue stones and prepare a raised altar four cubits (in the maņdapa) and should provide holy songs, music and dance therein. He should have benedictions from brāhmaṇas. Then

he should make a sankalpa 'On the Ramanavami I shall observe a fast for the whole day and being intent on worshipping Rāma shall make a golden image of Rāma and shall donate it for pleasing Rāma' and then say 'may Rāma remove my numerous heavy sins'. The image of Rāma should be placed on a pedestal, have two hands and Janaki should be seated on the left thigh of (Rāma) image, which should be bathed with pañcāmrta, 218 then mūlamantra 219 should be recited and the usual nyāsas should be made. The festival or pūjā is performed in the noon, Then at night he should keep awake and listen to the divine stories about Rāma and be surrounded by devotees of Rama, should sing hymns about Rāma. Then the next morning he should bathe, perform sandhyā, should worship the image of Rāma with sixteen upacāras employing the 16 verses of Rg. X. 90 and with Pauraṛika verses, also perform the worship of the several limbs of the image (Sri-Rāmabhadrāya namaḥ pādau pūjayāmi and so on), offer homa on the altar or in a kunda with the mūlamantra and then in the ordinary fire offer 108 oblations of clarified butter or pāyasa (rice cooked in milk with sugar), then he should honour the ācārya with gifts of ear-rings, finger rings, flowers, clothes &c. and should recite the following mantra 'O Rāma! I shall today donate this golden image of yours decked with ornaments and clothes for securing your favour; may Rāma favour me'. He should give dakşiņā (fee) to the ācārya and to other brāhmapas gold, cow, a pair of clothes, corn, according to his ability and then have dinner along with the brāhmaṇas. By doing so he becomes free from even mortal sins like brāhmaṇa-murder. There is no need to say more. The man who performs this vrata has mukti in his hand (as it were) and he acquires the same merit that one secures by the dāna called Tulāpurusa 220 in 

218. Images of gods are bathed with qua i, e. milk, curds, clarified butter, honey and sugar. 

219. Nyāsa is mystical sanctification of the several limbs of the body with Vedic mantras (such as the 16 verses of Rgveda X. 90 ) or other mantras. Vide H, of Dh. vol. II, pp. 319-320, 739 and 900 The Mūlamantra is either of six letters, viz. IFTACTACTA or of thirteen letters, viz. श्रीरामजयरामजयजयरामेति. In these days the priest sometimes repeats Rg. X 3.3 as the Vedic mūlamantra 'HET HET FAT ITTICE THE OTTI para osarai aamarasa yang TREPT THATURTH'. Here the word राम occurs, though in a different sense. सायण explains 'रामं कृष्णं शार्वरं वमः'.

Kuruksetra on a solar eclipse. Hemādri is comparatively brief, but the Tithitattva (pp. 61-62), Nirnayasindhu (p. 85), Vratārka add further details from Agastyasamhitā. They say that images of Bharata and Satrughna (by the side of Rāma image) and of Laksmana with a bow in his hand and of Dasaratha (to the right) and of Kausalyā should also be made and worshipped with appropriate Paurānika mantras (the one for Kausalyā is quoted in the note )22 The Rāmārcanacandrikā adds further details about the worship of ten and five ūvaranas to which even tho Nirnayasindhu refers by name alone. 

Rāmanavami is not to be celebrated in the intercalary Caitra month (malamāsa). The same rule applies to Janmāstami and other vratas. 

In modern times not many people observe a fast on Rāma navami and hardly one performs homa or donates images, but the birth of Rāma is celebrated in Rāma temples by many at noon with great ceremony. A. Haridāsa treats a gathering of men and women assembled in the temple to a kirtan with music and bhajan on the birth of Rāma. At the end there is distribu tion of sweets or 'Suņthavadā' (dried ginger with sugar or jaggery) in the Deccan. In some places such as Nasik, Tirupati, Ayodhyā and Rāmeśvara this festival is performed with great pomp and thousands of people attend at these holy places. There is no holy name other than that of Rāma so constantly on Hindu lips even in these days. 

The important tithi in Vaišākha is the third of the bright half. It is called Akşayya-trtiya. The earliest reference to it is probably in the Visņu-dharmasūtra where it is said that one should fast on this tithi, worship Vāsudeva with whole grains of rice, should offer them into fire and donate them; thereby one becomes purified from all sins; whatever a man donates on that day becomes inexhaustible. The Matsyapurāna (chap. 65, verses 1-7), Nāradīya I. 112. 10 ff treat of this. The former states that whatever is donated or sacrificed or muttered on this tithi becomes inexhaustible (in reward), that a fast thereon yields inexhaustible results, that if this trtiyā has Kettikā asterism

then it is specially commended. The Bhavisyottara-purāņa 273 (chap. 30. 1-19) deals at some length with it. It says: 'this tithi is one of the Yugādi tithis because the Krta age began on it; whatever is done on it, such as bath, gifts, muttering of sacred texts (jupa), offerings into fire, Veda study, satiating deceased ancestors (with water all that becomes inexhaustible'. It provides that gifts of jars of water and of umbrellas and of footwear should be made (to brāhmaṇas) on this day and that what is sacrificed or donated on this day never comes to an end and therefore this tithi is called aksaya (inexhaustible) by the sāges. V. Dh. also refers to it 223The Lar plates of Govinda. candra of Kanauj recite that the king after bathing in the Ganges on the occasion of the Aksayya-trtiyā festival on Monday in sainvat 1202 (i. e. 15th April 1146 A. D.) made the grant of a village to one Sridhara Thakkura (E. I. vol. VII p. 98). The third is to be taken for these religious rites when it exists in the forenoon; but if it exists in the forenoon on two days the one that exists on the later day should be chosen for vrata. Vide Hemādri on Kāla p. 618 and on vrata vol. I, pp. 500-502, Vratarāja pp. 93–96, Sm. K. p. 109 for further details. It is provided in the Purāpas that śrāddha performed on the tithis called Yugādi gives inexhaustible gratification to the pitřs. But no pindas (rice-balls ) are to be offered in Yugādi-śrāddha. Akşayyatştiyā is one of the 3 days popularly believed to be most auspicious in the year ( it is itself 1). 

On the third of Vaišākha bright half is celebrated Parašurāmajayanti'.224 It is to be celebrated in the first prahara

(watch) of the night ('gūryāstottaram trimuhūrtaḥ pradosaḥ' Dharmasindhu p. 9). It is stated in the Skanda 225 and Bhavisya purāṇas that Vişnu was born from Renuki on the third of the bright half of Vaišākha when the naksatra was Punarvasu and in the first watch of the night and when six planets were ucca (in exaltation) and Rāhu was in the zodiacal sign Mithuna (Gemini). The image of Paražurāma is to be worshipped and arghya is to be offered to it with the mantra quoted below.226 If the third tithi is suddhā (i. e. not mixed with another tithi) the vrata (i. e. fast) is to be performed that day; but if on two days there is third tithi in the evening first watch even partially, then the later one is to be the day of the fast; otherwise (if the third is viddhi, but does not extend up to the first watch of the night) the fast should be observed on the first of the two days. There are some temples erected in honour of Parasurama, particularly in the Konkana such as the one near Chiplun in which Paraśurāma jayanti is celebrated with great ceremony. Vide N. S. p. 95, Sm. K. p. 112, P. C. 89 for further details. H. V. I. p. 117 gives directions as to the image or painting of Paraśurāma. But Paraśurāma-jayanti is not observed in several parts of India (such as Saurāştra), though observed in South India. 

In the month of Jyestha there is a vrata called Daśaharā on the 10th tithi of the bright half. The Brahmapurāņa (63. 15) states that the 10th of Jyestha bright half is called Daśaharā, because it destroys ten sins 227. Ten sins (divided into three

classes, of the body, of speech and of the mind) are enumerated in Manu XII. 5–7.228 The Rājamārtanda (verses 1397–1405) speaks of this yrata. The N. S. (p. 98) and some other digests put forward another basis, viz. 229 Jyestha śu. 10 on Tuesday (acc. to Varāha) or Wednesday (acc. to Skanda), on Hasta naksatra, Vyatīpāta, Gara ( karana), Ananda-yoga, the moon and sun being in Virgo and Taurus respectively--when all these concur or when most of them concur, a person should bathe in the Ganges and then become free from all sins. Wednesday and Hasta constitute Anandayoga. It was supposed that the Ganges came to the earth on this tithi, on Tuesday and on Hasta asterism and therefore originally it appears to have been a vrata of a bath in the Ganges at Daśāśvamedha, of worship and gifts. Then it was extended to a bath in any big river and offering of arghya, sesame and water. Vide Kāśikhanda, Tristhali-setu, K.T: 431, Vratarāja pp. 352-355, P. C. pp. 144-145 for further details. At present in towns and villages on the big rivers such as Krşņā, Godāvari, Narmadā and the Ganges, a festival of the Ganges is celebrated. At such places as Banaras, Prayāga, Haridyāra, Nasik the utsava is celebrated on a large scale. If there be an intercalary Jyestha, this vrata was to be performed in that month. 

On the Full moon day of Jyestha women whose husbands are living perform even now in many parts of India the Sāvitri vrata or Vatasāvitrivrata. The story of Savitri whose memory has been cherished for ages by all Indian women as an ideal of a pativratā, of wifely devotion to the husband unto death (and even thereafter) is very popular and is described at great length in the Mahābhārata (Vanaparva chap. 293-299) and in the Purānas (such as in Matsya, chap. 208–214, Skandapurāņa, Prabhāsakhanda chap. 166, Vispudharmottara, II chap. 36-41).

is narrated230 that she married Satyavat whose death at the end of one year was predicted by the sage Nārada and that three days before the time indicated by Nārada she undertook a fast, accompanied her husband into the forest where he had gone to collect firewood, flowers and fruits as his blind father had lost his kingdom and that she had an argument with Yama the God of Death, who became so pleased with her that he gave her several boons and ultimately ber husband that had died as predicted was restored to life. The Bhavisyapurāna account of the story of Sāvitri is cited at great length in Krtyaratnākara (pp. 264-278). Hemādri (on vrata II pp. 258–272) sets out a vrata called Brahma-Sāyitrīvrata from Bhayisyottara which contains the story of Sāvitri as in the Mahābhārata and Matsya and also (vol. II pp. 272-279) a Vatasāvitrīvrata from Skanda. But the first was performed for three days from the 13th tithi to Full Moon in Bhādrapada month and not in Jyestha, while the 2nd was to be performed on Jyestha Full Moon by a woman whose husband was living or even by a sonless widow. This last is called Mahā savitrivrata by the Vratakālaviveka (p. 20 of I. H. Q. vol. 17 No. 4 supplement). 

The Nirnayasindhu refers to the vrata in Bhadrapada mentioned by Hemādri and remarks 231 that it was not in vogue in its day. The Vrataprakāśa describes (folios 169–170) the Brahmasāvitrīvrata. 

प 

But the Vatasāvitrivrata that is now in vogue must also have been performed long before the 10th century A. D. The Agnipurana (194. 5-8) briefly describes 232 a vrata that in

Vatasāvitrivrata 

essentials is the same as the modern Vatasāvitrīyrata. The Rājamārtanda says 'on the 14th 233 of the bright half of Jyestha women full of faith perform the Sāvitrivrata for being free from widowhood'. This is followed by people in the Deccan. The Nirnayāmṛta following the Bhavisya held that this vrata was to be performed on Amāvāsyā, while the Krtyatattva (p. 430 ), and T. T. p. 121 say that Sāvitrīvrata is to be observed on dark 14th after the Full Moon of Jyestha. 

If the Paurnimā is spread over two days, then the vrata is to be performed on Caturdaśī (14th tithi) mixed up with Paurnimā. The three days for which the vrata is to last may have to be begun on the 12th or 13th. But if caturdaśī is of the extent of 18 ghatikās and then Paurņimā supervenes, then caturdaśī is to be given up (K. N. p. 301). 

The worship of the Vața tree comes in probably because Satyavat when the moment of death approached took shelter under the shade of the Vata tree and supported himself by & branch of it and spoke in a choked voice to Savitri that he had pain in the head. 234 The procedure of this vrata as set out in the Vratarka (folios 312–320) and other late medieval works is briefly as follows:-The woman should make a sankalpa in the form 'I shall perform Sāvitrivrata for securing long life and health to my husband and my sons and for securing freedom from widowhood in this and subsequent lives'. She should then sprinkle water at the root of the Vata tree and surround it with cotton threads and should perform its worship with the upacaras and then offer worship to Savitri (with image or mentally) from her feet upwards and pray to her to bestow on her beauty, good name, prosperity, and freedom from widowhood. Then she should worship Yama and Nārada and give presents (rūyana) to the priest and break her fast next day. In Bengal the mode of performing Savitri-vrata is different from the above. In Bengal there is no Vatasāvitrivrata, but there is Sāvitricaturdasi on the 14th of the dark half of Jyestha to secure blessed wifehood in later lives. It is continued for 14 years.

If a woman was unable to fast for three days, she was allowed to have nakta on the 13th, to eat on the 14th whatever came to her without her asking for it and fast on the 15th.235 

In JAOS. vol. 21 part 2 pp. 53-66 Allen has compared the Sāvitrīvrata as described in the Mahābhārata and the purānas and in Hemādri and Vratārka. 

I have not generally tried to speculate about the remote origins, if any, of even the most important vratas. But some scholars endowed with a lively imagination and imbued with the theories underlying Frazer's 'Golden Bough' have tried their hands at the origins of some yratas. The late Mr. B. A. Gupte endeavoured to explain the symbolism of the Sāvitrīvrata' in I. A. vol. 35 (for 1906) pp. 116–119. He bases his article on the forty figures that his wife drew with sandalwood paste in celebrating the Sāvitri-vrata. He holds that the story of Savitri is based on a Nature Myth and that the first impression produced on him by the pictures drawn by his wife is that it is a marriage scene. What mainly vitiates all his imaginative explanations is that the Savitrī-vrata is not mentioned anywhere in any work that can be said to be even two thousand years old and that he thinks his wife's figures or pictures represent the general way of celebrating that vrata in the whole of India throughout the centuries. The Sāvitrīvrata is observed throughout India, but I have not been able to find that women all over India depict the scene as was done by Mr. Gupte's wife (who probably was a well educated lady and had an artistic training in some big city and turned her skill to lend charm and picturesqueness to that yrata, by adding her own artistic ideas to those of millions of unedu cated simple women in small towns and villages ).

CHAPTER V

EKĀDASI 

The most important tithi in the month of Āsādha is Ekādaśī. A voluminous literature has grown round Ekādasi in the Purāṇas and medieval digests. There are separate treatises on Ekādaśī written by medieval writers, such as the Ekādasi viveka of Sūlapāni and the Ekādasītattva of Raghunandana: Besides, such medieval digests as Kālaviveka (pp. 425-451), Hemādri on Kāla pp. 145–288, Kālanirnaya of Mādhava (pp. 233–275), Vratarāja pp. 361-475, Kāla-tattvaviyecana (pp. 98–172) devote hundreds of pages to discussions on Ekādasi. Endeavour would be made to write about most of the numerous matters relating to Ekadasi, but everything would have to be compressed in as small a space as possible. 

If one were to examine the numerous passages of the Purānas and the like one would notice that some simply prohibit the partaking of food (on Ekādaśī), while others lay down the observance of Ekādaśīvrata. A few specimens of the first kind may be cited. The Nāradiya states 236 "all sins whatever and sins equal to brāhmana-murder take resort to food on the day of Hari; one who partakes of food on Ekādaśī incurs those sins; the Purāņas again and again loudly proclaim 'one should not eat food, one should not eat food, when the day of Hari comes'." In this case the observance of Ekādaśī consists in simply not eating for the whole day anything that is cooked. Those passages which contain the word vrala are not to be looked upon as merely prohibiting (the eating of food) but are to be construed as prescribing something positive as in the case of Prajāpativrata 'one should not see the rising sun', which is interpreted by

Jaimini IV. 1. 3.-6 and VI. 2. 20. Vide n. 42 above. For example, it is said by the Matsya and Bhavisya 'When a man fasts on the 11th and partakes of food on the 12th, whether in the bright or dark half, that is a great vrata in honour of Visnu'. Those passages that contain the word 'upavāsa' and those that prescribe rewards (of observing ekādaśī) must be construed as laying down the observance of a vrata and not as merely prohibiting anything. Those passages also which condemn eating food on ekādaśī may be construed as merely intended to commend the vrata and not to contain a prohibition, following the Mimāmsā 237 maxim "condemnation is not indulged in (merely) for the sake of condemnation of that which is condemned, but for the purpose of commending the performance of the opposite of what is censured'. The passages that lay down a vrata are again two-fold, viz. those that make the observance of Ekādaśī obligatory (nutya)238 and those that lay down the observ ance for securing some desired object (kāmya). Nārada lays down an obligatory rule 'men who are devoted to Visnu and who look upon Visnu as their highest goal should always fast on ekādaśī in each paksa (fortnight)'. A passage laying down a kāmya-vidhi about Ekādaśi is contained in 239 Kātyāyana 'a person who looks on Visnu as highest goal and who desires to Cross the ocean of samsūra or to secure prosperity, offspring, heaven, mokṣa or whatever else, should not partake of food on ekādaši in both fortnights.' The result is that ekādaśī is both nitya and kāmya and the maxim of samyoga-prthaktva cited above (p. 86) under Rāmanavami applies. Ekādaśīvrata on the ekādaśīs of both fortnights is nitya only for persons other than house holders; the vrata is obligatory for householders (grhastha) only on the ekādaśī of the bright half, but not on the ekādasi of the dark half, since Devala says 'one should not eat (cooked) food on ekādaśī in both pakşas (fortnights); this is the rule of conduct for forest hermits and ascetics, but a householder should

Adhikūra for Ekādaśīvrata 

always observe only the Ekādaśī of the bright half'. 240 There are conflicting texts on this subject. The Padma says 241 ' a house holder should observe a fast on only the dark ekādaśīs between Sayani (Asādha śu. 11) and Bodhini (Kārtika su. 11) and on no other ekadasi of the dark half'. There is a precept of Narada 242 

a householder having a son should not obserye a fast on a Sankranti day, on the day of ekādaśī in the dark half and on eclipses of the sun and the moon'. The best construction of these passages appears to be that a fast only on the ekādaśi of the bright half is obligatory for a householder, but he may observe (Kāmyavrata) a fast on the ekādašīs occurring in the dark half between Sayani and Bodhini, but if he has a son he should not obserye a fast even on those ekādaśis that occur between Sayani and Bodhini. A widow 243 is to be treated on the same level aa a yati and a woman whose husband is living should fast only on the ekādaśī of the bright half. It has to be further noted that these restrictions 214 do not apply to professed devotees of Visņu ( technically called Vaisnava). To them the verse quoted in note 238 above applies and they have to observe a fast on all ekadasis. Hemadri (on vrata vol. I. p. 999) held the view that all persons have adhikūra for fasting on ekadasis in both paksas. 

On pp. 43-45 above the exaggerated importance attached to yratas in general has already been dealt with. Upavāsa as a prāyaścitta (expiation for sins) has been described in vol. IV.

History of Dharmasastra 

[Sec. I, Ch. V 

pp. 52-54. Extremely exaggerated praise of the efficacy of fasting on Ekādasi has been indulged in by many Purānas and digests. In the Nārada-purāna there is a long passage on the greatness (māhātmya) of Ekādasi (quoted in Hemādri on Kala p. 146 and Kalanirnaya pp. 273-274). A few of the verses may be cited here; 'by the fire arising from (the observance of) ekādasi, fuel in the form of sins committed in hundreds of past lives is reduced to ashes. Thousands of Ašvamedha sacrifices and hundreds of Vājapeya sacrifices do not reach even up to the 16th part (of the merit) of the fast on ekādasi. This ekādasi bestows heaven and mokşa, confers a kingdom and sons (on a man) and a good spouse and the health of the body. The Ganges, Gaya, Kasi, Puskara, Kuruksetra, the Narmada, the Devika, the Yamunā, the Candrabhāgā are none of them equal to the day of Hari'. Similar verses occur in the Padmapurāna.245 The Anu Sasanaparva 246 pronounces on Upavasa. an exaggerated eulogy. The Padma 247 declares 'on hearing the word ekadasi, the mes sengers of Yama become afraid; having fasted on ekādaśī which is the best among all vratas, one should keep awake (in the night) for propitiating Visnu and should sumptuously decorate the temple or manda pa of) Visņu. The man who worships Hari with basil leaves secures by each single leaf the reward of a crore of sacrifices'.248 The Varahapurana (chap. 30) declares that Brahma. gave Ekādaśī to Kubera (the lord of wealth) and that to the person who controls himself, who is pure and eats only what is not cooked by fire, Kubera, being pleased, gives everything. The Padma narrates the story of a woman, who was always quarrel some and who thought of her lover, was therefore censured by her husband and beaten, and who in anger went without food and died at night and who on account of her fast 249 (not under

taken cheerfully and willingly, but out of angor) became pure. The Garudapurāna declares :250 (if one places) on one side (in one pan) the gift of the whole world and on the other side (in another pan) the day of Hari, this ekādasi is more holy and superior. The ekādasi in Aşādha sukla is called mahā-ekādasi and also Sayani. 

General rules about those who have the adhikīra to under take yratas have already been dealt with above. But some rules meant specially for the observers of ekādaśī will be set out here. Nārada 250a provides 'A human being who is more than eight years old and is less than eighty years in age incurs sin if he eats food on ekādaśī through foolishness.' Kātyāyana has a similar verse. These two establish that every human being of whatever caste or ūsramı can observe ekādaśī provided he fulfils the conditions as to age laid down in the verses. 

Knowing the weakness of human beings, sages relaxed the rule of an absolute fast on ekādaśī. The Nāradapurāņa 251 says 'roots, fruits, milk and water may be partaken of (on ekadasi) by great sages, but no sages have said that on ekādaśī cooked food may be taken'. The Vayupurana 252 provided 'partaking of havisya food at night, food other than boiled rice, fruits, sesame, milk, water, ghee, pañca-gavya, air-each succeeding one is here (i. e. in ekadasi) more commendable (than each preceding one)'. Baudhāyana 253 declares that those who are unable to observe a

complete fast (on ekādasi) or who are over 80 years of age should resort to ekabhakta and the other (alternatives). The Matsya provides 254 that those who are unable to fast (on ek dasi) should prefer to take food by the nakta method and if a person is ill, he should make his son and others to undertake the fast (on his behalf). Who can act as pratinidhis in the case of a vrata has already been described above ( pp. 53-54). 

It is said by Markandeya 255 that one may observe the methods of ekabhakta, nakta, ayācita, complete fast and dāna, but should not deprive oneself of the benefits of the observance of dvādaśī (with ekādasi). Here certain alternatives are allowed in place of an absolute fast and they have to be explained. But before doing so, attention has to be drawn to the rule propounded by Manu 256 viz. if a person, being master of (i. o. quite able to carry out) the main provisions for a rite, resorts to alternatives provided (by texts) he would not, foolish as he is, secure the otherworldly rewards ( of that rite). Therefore, ekabhakta, nakta and ayācita are to be employed only if one is unable to observe a strict fast. Ekabhakta means eating only once a day after the middle of the day. Madhyāhna means the 3rd part of the day divided into five parts (i. e. from the 13th ghati after sunrise up to the 18th of a day of 30 ghatīs). Hemādri (on kāla p. 109) holds that madhyāhna is the middle part of the day divided into three parts and according to him the proper time for ekabhakta is the time immediately after midday, since the Skanda employs the words after the middle of the day is passed' (dinārdhasamayestite),257 while the gauņa-kala is up to

sunset. Works like the Nirnayāmrta, Smrtikaustubha (pp. 9-10) approve of the division into five parts, and hold that ekabhakta means taking food at sometime between the 13th and 18th ghati of the day (of 30 ghatīs).258 When ekabhakta is merely an alternative to strict upavāsa on ekādasi, food must be taken on the tithi on which the fast would have been observed if the performer were able to undergo it. The same 259 rule applies to nakta as a substitute for upavāsa. 

Ekabhakta is also a vrata independently performed (without reference to ekādaśī). The Anusāsanaparva (chap. 106 verses 17-30) declares the rewards secured by observing ekabhakta in each month from Mārgaśīrsa to Kārtika and Anuśāsanaparva (chap. 107. 13-126) dilates upon the fruits of observing ekabhakta on each of the thirty days of a month. The Kștyakalpataru on vrata (pp. 457-468) sets out practically the whole of Anušāsana parva chap. 107 (which the editor appears not to have noticed) and Hemādri on vrata vol. II. pp. 930-931 does the same. The Krtyakalpataru (on vrata pp. 419-421), the Krtyaratnākara (pp. 406-7 and later on) and Hemādri on vrata (vol. II pp. 748–798) quote Anušāsana 106. 17–30 about ekabhakta in different months at different places. 

Nakta-Two verses about nakta occurring in the Linga, Nārada 160 and other purāņas are: alms collected by begging are superior to fasting, food obtained without requesting anyone for it (i, e. ayācitu) is superior to alms, nakta is superior to ayācita, therefore one should subsist by nakta method; eating havisya food, bath, truthfulness, small intake of food, offering oblations

into fire, and sleeping on the ground, these six should always be observed by one who takes a meal only at nakta. There is divergence of views about the time that should be called nakta. Hemādri 261 (on Kāla pp. 112-115) discusses at length what is naktakāla. The first rule is that in a naktavrata the tithi ( if viddhā) to be accepted is the one that exists at the time of pradosa. Pradosa is the period of six ghatikās after sunset (acc. to Skandapurāna), while Viśvādarsa holds that it is a period of three ghatikās after sunset. P. C. (p. 46 ) explains the latter quotation as meaning that three ghatīkās after sunset is com mended as the most proper time of pradosa. The Bhavisya purāna states:262 some men desire that nakta should be the time when the stars begin to appear, some wise men say that nakta is the time when only one muhūrta (two ghatikās) of the day remains, while I hold that nakta is the time when the stars begin to appear. From this it appears 263 that the proper time (mukhya kūla) for nakta is after the stars are seen, other times being gauna. Nakta has two meanings, one primary viz. period of time and the other figurative or secondary viz. taking food at nakta time. 

There is a special naktavrata apart from upavāsa. Vide list for a brief description. 

Ayācita means 'subsisting on food not obtained by begging or requesting any one'. The sankalpa in this case 264 is 

during this day and night I shall not eat food obtained by begging or requesting any one'. No particular time can be specified about ayācitavrata, since food may be brought by some one at any time. But when such food is brought he has to partake of it only once. In the word'ayācita' not only265 is there

a prohibition against begging for food belonging to another, but one is prohibited from requesting his wife or servant to serve food belonging to himself. Therefore, if a man's wife or servant without being directed by him bring cooked food to him he may partake of it, but not otherwise. 

These terms ekabhakta, nakta, ayūcita were used in ancient times in connection with prāyaścittas like Krcchra and were taken over into the lore of fasts when the latter became common in the times of the Purāņas. Vide Ap. Dh. S. I. 9. 27.7, Gaut. 26. 1-5, Yāj. III. 318 and H. of Dh. vol. IV. p. 132 under Krochra. 

Padma (Uttarakhanda, chap. 36) gives a fanciful story of the birth of ekādasi. 

Leaving aside the exaggerations and bizzare statements of some of the Purāņas the underlying conception of a fast on ekādasi is spiritual; it is a discipline of the mind, the idea being that fasting undertaken cheerfully purges man's spirit of the lower animal passions and brings him to a mental level at which he becomes fit to receive God's grace. The Bhagavadgitā 266 emphasizes that in the case of a man who takes no food the objects of sense may leave him for the time being but that the relish for those still remains and vanishes only when he has a vision of the Highest. The Br. Up. states 267 that 'brāhmanas desire to know that Great Soul by the study of the Veda, by sacrifices, by gifts and by austerities consisting of abstention from food'. This idea of the efficacy of fasting under taken cheerfully is common to several religions. For example, Matthew VI. 16-18 says 'Moreover when ye fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad countenance......but thou, when thou fastest, anoint thine head and wash thy face, that thou appear not unto men to fast, but unto thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father, which seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly'. 

The fast on ekādasi is of two kinds; one 268 consists in carry ing out (or adhering to) the prohibition of eating cooked food;

the other is of the nature of a vrata. As regards the first all persons including householders having a son have adhikāra to observe it even in the dark half; but as regards the second (upavāsa of the nature of vrata) householders that have progeny should not observe it on the ekādaśīs of the dark half; they should not make a sankalpa, they should simply give up cooked food but should observe the niyamas of celibacy and the like. As to ekādaśīs of the dark half between the Sayani and Bodhini even householders with sons have the right to perform the vrata. Similarly, those who desire to secure absorption into Visnu, long life and sons may perform a kāmyavrata on ekādaśīs of both paksas. Vaisnava householders should always fast even on ekādasis of the dark half. The ekādaśīvrata is obligatory on all including devotees of Siva, Visnu and the Sun. Upayāsa in the nature of vrata is again of two kinds, nitya and kāmya. These are briefly the rules laid down in the Nirnayasindhu and Dharmasindhu (p.16). The main difference between mere upavāsa and upayāsavrata is that in the former there is no sankalpa that the person is undertaking an upayāsayrata and he simply abstains from taking food because the sistra says that on ekādaśī one should not eat cooked food, while in the latter there is sankalpa and there are also several other matters to be observed.

It would now be proper to give a comparatively early but brief description of ekādaśīvrata. The Nāradapurāņa (Purvārdha chap. 23 verses 12 ff.) describes the procedure as follows:-on the 10th tithi the man who has to observe the vrata should after getting up brush his teeth, take a bath, bathe a Visnu image in pancūmīta and offer worship (of several upacaras) to it. On the 11th, after bathing, he should bathe the image with pañcāmṛta and worship Visņu with sandalwood paste, flowers and the like

and repeat the mantra 269 after remaining without food on the ekādasi I shall, O lotus-eyed one, on the next day partake of cooked food; be you, O Acyuta, my refuge'. He should take no food, should curb his senses, should lie down in front of the Vişnu image, keep awake engaged in songs, music and dances relating to Visņu and listen to stories about Visņu contained in the Purāņas. On the 12th tithi, he should after a bath for himself, bathe the image with milk and then address the following prayer 270 O Keśava! May you by reason of this vrata favour (me) who am blinded by the darkness of ignorance, may you turn your benignant face (towards me) and bestow on me the sight of knowledge'. Then he should feed brāhmaṇas and give them daksiņā (gifts or fees) according to his ability. After that he should perform his daily five sacrifices (brahmayajña, pitstarpaņa, vaiśvadeva, bali and atithi-pūjana) and should himself take his meal along with his relatives and should observe restraint of speech when eating. While engaged in the upavāsa vrata, a person should never look at cāndālas, persons guilty of grave sins, atheists, those that have violated the rules of proper conduct, those who engage in vituperations or back-biting; he should not speak with the husband of a vrsali, with one who acts as a priest for those who are unfit for performing sacrifices, with one who worships images in temples for money, with one who subsists by practising the profession of singing or medicine (for money ), with one who is a bard or one who is opposed to gods and brāhmaṇas or those who are fond of eating at others' houses and adulterers. One who is engaged in upavāsa vrata should be pure (in body and mind), should control himself and should be intent on doing good to all. For the meaning of vrsalī, vide H. of Dh. vol. IV. p. 104 note 236 and p. 394 note 881. Manu III. 152 provides that physicians and priests doing worship in temples for money are unfit to be invited at śrāddha.

It will be noticed that the main matters in the vrata are upavāsa, worship of Visnu image, jāgara 271 at night with songs and music, pāraṇā on 12th and certain restrictions about looking at some persons or speaking to them and restraint of the senses. The Brahma-vaivarta (IV. 26.1-93) also contains the procedure of ekadasi-vrata. It will be noticed 72 that in the procedure of ekadasi there is no homa, though in some other vratas there is a homa. 

Accretions gathered round this simple procedure. It was laid down early enough that one engaged in upayāsavrata should miss four meals in three days, i. e. he should eat only once on the 10th in the noon, fast 273 both times on 11th and on the 12th he should miss one meal. The general rule is that the sankalpa for yratas is to be made in the morning, but as regards ekādasi vrata exceptions have been made in the digests. For example, it is said that the sankalpa 274 about niyamas is to be made on the night of the 10th tithi. If ekādaśī is mixed up with 10th, then sankalpa about fast is to be made at night;275 if daśami

The परशुरामप्रताप (folio 83 b) quotes a passage from the Skanda that states that there are 26 items in Jagara : गीतं वाद्यं च नृत्यं च पुराणपठनं तथा। धूपं दीपं च नैवेद्यं पुष्पगन्धानुलेपनेः। फलमय च नेवेद्यं दानमिन्द्रिय संयमः। सत्यान्वितं विनिद्रं च मुदायुक्त क्रियान्वितम्। सास्वर्य वैचासत्साहं (सास्वर्यं चैव सोत्साहं ! ) पापालस्यादिवर्जितम् । प्रदक्षिणासमायुक्तं नमस्कारपुरःसरम् । नीराजनसमायुक्त. मतिहष्टेन चेतसा । यामे यामे महाभागे कुर्यादारात्रिकं हरेत् ( हरेः) । षविशगुणसंयुक्तमेकादश्यां तु जागरम् । यः करोति नरो भक्त्या न पुनर्जायते भुवि ॥.

Time for sankalpa

extends beyond midnight and the ekādasi becomes mixed with it, sankalpa is to be made the next day after noon. Hemādri (on vrata vol. I. p. 1006) and Kālanirpaya (p. 268) provide that the image of Visnu should be worshipped in a mandara decorated charmingly with flowers of various kinds. It is provided in the Skanda 276 that when a person breaks his fast on the 12th he should partake of the naivedya mixed with Tulasi (basil) leaves, since that destroys ( the sins of) crores of murders. 

Numerous medieval digests set out the procedure of ekidasi vrata. It is impossible for reasons of space to refer to them. For the sake of comparison with the Naradapurina procedure, I shall set out the procedure of Ekidašīvrata from the Dharmasindhu (p. 19), almost the latest authoritative work on Dharmaśāstra. 

Now (is set out) the procedure ,of (ekidaši) vrata. On the day previous to the fast, the person, after performing all his daily duties in the morning, should make a sankalpa in the form 'beginning from the 10th tithi, O god Keśaya, lord of gods, I shall perform for three days your vrata; make it free from obstacles'. Then at midday (of 10th) he should eat by the ekabhakta method. The restrictions to be observed about ekabhakta are: he should avoid taking food in a vessel of bell metal, avoid flesh, masūra pulse, sleeping by day, over-eating, drinking too much water, eating food again (after the midday meal), sexual intercourse, telling falsehood, honey, gram, kodrava, vegetables, the food belonging to others, gambling, oil, sesame cakes, tumbula (betol leaves and nut &c.); if he has to cleanse his teeth after ekabhakta he should do so with twigs. At night he should sleep on a bed spread on the ground. In the morning of ekādaśī he should cleanse his teeth with the leaves of a tree and not with twigs. After performing bath and other daily duties, he should put on his finger a p.vitra (loop) made of darbha grass, turn his face to the north, take a copper vessel full of water and make a sankalpa as follows: 'after remaining with out food on the ekādasi I shall, O lotus-eyed one, on the next day partake of cooked food; O Acyuta, be you my refuge'. Or he may offer a handful of flowers to Hari with this mantra. In the case of him who is unable to observe a total fast, necessary changes may be made in the sentence of sankalpa according to

his ability viz. 'on ekadaši I shall subsist on water or milk or on fruits or I shall take food at the time of nakta'. Saivas should make the sankalpa with Rudra Giyatri ;277 Sun-worshippers should make the sankalpa with the usual Gāyatri (Rg. III. 62. 10 * tatsayitur' &c.) or by taking the name of the Sun. This sankalpa should be made by smārtas on the night of the ekādaśī tithi, if there is 10th tithi after sunrise (mixed up with ekādasi); if 10th tithi exists beyond midnight on daśami day all (whether smārtas or vaisnavas) should make the sankalpa after midday. He should drink the water used for sankalpa. On making the sankalpa he should pronounce over it thrice the mantra of eight syllables (such as 'om namo Nārāyaṇiya'). Then after erecting a mandapa decorated with flowers (garlands &c.) he should offer worship to Hari (image) according to prescribed rules in that mandapı with flowers, fragrant substances, incense, best naivedya, with various divine hymns of praise, charming songs and music, with straight prostrations on the ground like a staff, with best announcements with the word 'jaya' and at night he should keep awake. 

The cult of ekādaśī went on growing apace, so much so that for the 24 ekādasis of the twelve months of the lunar year and for the two ekādaśīs of the intercalary month separate names were invented. It is not possible to say with certainty when these names were given, but some of them must be about two thousand years old. 

The twenty-four names beginning with caitra sukla ekādasi and ending with phālguna dark half ekādasi are given in the note below.278 There is some divergence about the names, but 

277. The goal is : 6974 AHỆ HETETT Efiapei na Fa: 171997 \#. \#. II. 9. 

278. The 24 names from a 99 in order are Fri, afroat, ATTEST, अपरा; निर्जला, योगिनी; शयनी, कामिका or कामदा; पुत्रदा, अजा; परिवर्तिनी, इन्दिरा; TISTI, TT; entrat (or art), Jeuet ; \#ACT, MT; Elçi, yramt; PAT, PASTAT: fragat (or 3THER), qurage. The aggrut (VI, chapters 41-65) contains over a thousand verses on tbese and the legends connected with them. The Ahalyākāmadhenu (Ms. in Scindia Oriental Jostitute at Ujjain ) is probably the largest work on vratas having 1206 folios therein. It deals with these names on folios 696 to 799. As regards the two ekādasis in an iotercalary month, Padma VI. 64 and 65 say that it and arhet are the dames of dark and bright half gerasts, while the recipria (folios 807

for want of space no notice is taken of it here. One cause of divergence appears to be that in some Purānas the month is pūrnimānta, while in others the month is amānta and what is Bhadrakrsņa in Pūrnimānta reckoning is Srāvana-krşņa in Amānta reckoning. 

The ekādasi on Jyestha bright half is called nirjalā because the vrata consists in not using or drinking water except at the time of bathing or at ācamana. It is described by Hemādri (on vrata vol. I. pp. 1089-1091) who quotes the Mahābhārata for it and by N. S. pp. 99-100. In the summer month of Jyestha it must have been a great trial to go without water for a day and therefore it was specially commended. Visņu was supposed to sleep for four months from Āsādha bright ekādaśī at night and to rise from his sleep on Kārtika bright ekādasi by day and hence these two ekādaśīs are respectively called Sayani (connected with the sayana i. e. sleeping of Vişnu) and Prabhodhini 279 or Prabodhani (connected with the prabodha i. e. awakening of Vişnu). What the legend of Vişnu's sleeping from Āşādha śukla eleven for four months was really meant to illustrate or symbolize it is difficult to say. As these four months were the months of the rainy season in many parts of India all move ments from one place to another distant place came almost to a stand-still in ancient times; so probably mythology became busy and suggested that Visņu himself gave up all activity. It is possible that this legend of four months' sleep may have some connection with the state of things when the ancestors of the Vedic Aryans lived in northern latitudes, when for four months the sun was either not seen or emitted only faint light. This legend from whatever cause it may have arisen is worked up in various ways. It was said that Visņu not only slept on his snake couch but he also turned in his sleep from one side to the other (as human beings do) on Bhādrapada sukla eleven. And therefore that ekādasi in Bhadrapada was called Parivartini. This matter was still further elaborated and it was asserted that

all the great gods and goddesses went to sleep like Visnu on different dates, as stated in the Rājamārtanda quoted below. 280 Then, further differences arose, some works saying Visņu went to sleep on the 11th, some that Visnu slept on 13th, while a third set said that Visnu slept on the 15th of Āsādha bright half. The Vanaparva (203. 12) declares that Visnu sleeps on the hoods of Sesa. Kālidāsa in the Meghadūta refers to both the sleeping of Visņu on his snake couch and his rising from it (šāpānto me bhujagaśayanād utthite śārngapānau). Most scholars hold that Kālidāsa flourished between 350-450 A. D. In the Gangadhar Stone Inscription of Visvavarman in the Krta year 480 there is a clear reference to the rising from sleep of Visnu in Kārtika (vide Gupta Inscriptions ed. by Fleet No. 17 at pp. 72,75,79). Krta is held to be the same as Vikrama year by most scholars. So the legend about Visņu's sayana on a snake bed and getting up from it may be about 2000 years old, if not more. 

The question as to the tithi on which the gods ( and parti cularly Visnu) went to sleep very much exercised the minds of the authors of Purānas and of the digests. For example, the Vamanapurana (16. 6-16) contains verses 291 some of which may

The 2nd half of the first verse quoted is 'द्वादशी ऋक्षसंयोगात् पादयोगो न कारणम् । and in the 2nd verse the ms. reads श्रीधर्मराइ भास्करो देवः पर्वत and ब्रह्मा वायु शिवादयः प्रतिपदारम्भे तिथौ शेरते चोत्तिष्ठ०. The reference to पादयोगो० arises in this way. The भविष्य says that Visnu sleeps in the first quarter of अनुराधा, turns on another side in the middle of Sravina naksatra and wakes up in the last quarter of Revati. मैत्राद्यपादे स्वपितीह विष्णुर्वेष्गव्यमध्ये परिवर्तते च । पौष्णावसाने च सुरारिहन्ता विबुध्यते मासचतुष्टयेन । भविष्य q. by हे. on काल p. 897 (ascribes to नारदीय), का. वि. p. 175, व. क्रि. कॉ. p. 285, तिथितत्व p. 112 This is राजमार्तण्ड verse 1175 (folio 72a).

be summarised here; 'a person should arrange a couch in the form of the hoods of the snake Sesa for the lord of the world (Visnu) on the 11th tithi of Āsādha and offer worship; he should, being himself pure, seek on the 12th permission from brāhmanas invited, and should bring to sleep the Lord that wears yellow clothes? Then the purāna proceeds to narrate how Kāma (God of Love) sleeps on 13th of Āsādha on a bed of kadamla flowers, the Yakşas on 14th, Siva on the 15th (i. e. Pūrnimā) on a bed of tiger-skin, then Brahmā, Višvakarmā, Pāryatī, Ganeša, Yama, Skanda, the Sun, Kātyāyani, Laksmi, Lord of snakes, Sādhyas respectively go to sleep on the tithis of the dark half from 1st to 11th. The K. V. (p. 225) and Hemidri (on Kāla pp. 888-889) quote certain verses according to which Kubera, Laksmi, Bhavānī, Ganeja, Soma, Guha, Bhāskara, Durgā, the Mātrs, Vāsuki, sages, Visnu, Kāna, Siva are the lords of tithis from 1st to 14th for pavitrāropana (i. e. giving the sacred upavita to the gods) and for sayana. 

One important rule has to be remembered, 282 viz. whatever nakşa'ra or whatever lithi has a certain deity as its lord, the sleeping, turning from one side to another and the rest (i. e. getting up &c.) take place on that tithi or naksatra. Some celebrate the sayang of a god relying on the tithi, others rely on the naksatra. But the trouble is that one tithi has several lords, according to various authorities. For example, pratipad has three lords, Agni, Brahmā and Kubera (Garuda I. 116. 3–8). For reasons of space it is not possible to refer to the texts on which different tithis are assigned for the sayana of Vişnu. The Samayamayūkha (p. 79), K.T. V.p. 172 and Vrataprakāśa283 (part of Viramitrodaya) espouse the view of Āsādha eleventh (of bright half) relying on the Brahmapurāņa. Many digests favour the 12th as the tithi of sayana and prabodha of Visnu relying on the several yerses in the Varaha, Visņu dharmottara and other Puriņas. Vide Kālayiveka p. 175 (ff), V. K.

inscription referred to in I. A. vol. 25 p. 290 we have the words "punya utthānadvadasi' (the holy 12th tithi on which Visnu gets up from his couch), the inscription being dated in sake 1462 (1540 A. D.). In some works Asadha Full moon is advocated for the sayana of Visnu. 284Vide K. R. p. 208, K. V. p. 188, Krtya tattva p. 436. These works provide how sayana and prabodha are to be celebrated. On the sayani day, the devotee prepares a couch in the evening with a piece of cloth or with flowers, worships Vişnu (image) at night, repeats the mantra 'om namo Nārāyaṇāya' and then puts Visnu to sleep and repeats two verses, one of which is quoted below. 285 On the day of prabodha the image of Visnu is given an elaborate bath and a full worship is done and several mantras from Varāha-purāņa are recited and a Vedic verse (idam vişnur, Rg. I. 22. 17) also is recited. 

Persons having a hikūra for ekādaśī-vrata may be divided into two classes, viz. Vaisňavas and Smārtas. The word vaisnava is defined in some of the Puiānas 286 such as the Padma III. 1.21-32, IV. 10.65-66, VI. 252.74, VI. 69, Visnu III.7.20-33, III. 8.9-19, the Bhagavata and in some of the digests. A Vaisnava is really one who has received diksā (initiation) according to the Vaisnava ūgamas of the Vaikhānasa, Pañcarātra and other schools. The Skanda defines a Vaisnava: that man is a Vaisnava who does not forsake (fast on) ekādaśī, whether he

Characteristics of a Vaişņava

be reduced to the direct misery or whether great bliss might have come to him, who has been given the diksā of a Vaispava, who behaves equally towards all living beings, who does not swerve from the duties of his class (varna), who is equal to his own friends of his class (varna), who is equal to his own friends or his enemies, who, being high (in principles), does not deprive anyone (of his possessions) or does not injure anyone, and whose mind is pure. Vide Prof. S. K. De's Vaişpava faith and move ment' pp. 364-366 and p. 413 where the author gives an analysis of the characteristics of the Vaisnava devotee drawn from the Haribhaktivilāsa of Gopālabhatta (for followers of Caitanya). 

Though the Purānas give these definitions, some of which are very general and may apply even to persons not popularly called Vaisnavas, still in all parts of India and by all šiştas it is admitted that those are Vaisnavas who are traditionally 287 known by that appellation. The question on what tithi upavasa should be practised when ekādasi is mixed up with the tenth tithi and twelfth has to be often answered in different ways according as the person who is to observe the fast is a Vaisnava or a Smārta. The answer depends on the rules about vedha which are rather complicated. It is not possible within the space at my disposal to go into details. Those who want to make a deep study of this matter may consult Hemādri on Kāla pp. 206-288, Kālanirnaya pp. 233—256, Tithitattva pp. 104-108, Samaya prakāśa pp. 66–74, Nirņayasindhu pp. 37–44, Smrtimuktāphala (on Kāla) pp. 839-844), Dharmasindhu (pp. 16–19). 

Ekādaśî, like all other tithis, is of two kinds, viz. sampūrņā and yiddhā or khandā. The general definition 288 of the sampūrnā tithi is that when a tithi has the extent of 60 ghatikās commencing from the time of sunrise it is called sampūrņā. To this ekādaśī was stated by the Skandapurāņa 289 to be an excep tion. In the case of Ekādaśī the Garudapurāņa 290 and Bhavisya

(Sec. I, Ch. V 

lay down that ekādaśī is sampūrņā only when it exists also two muhūrtas (i. e, 4 ghatikās) before sunrise of the day on which it exists for the whole civil day. 

The Nārada and other purāṇas condemn fast on ekādasi mixed with daśami. Nāradapurāņa (pūrvārdha, chap. 29. 39-40) says the sixth tithi mixed with the 5th, the seventh mixed with the 9th and ekādaśī mixed with daśami-a fast should never be observed on these; all should accept (for fast) ekādasi free from daśami; daśami joined to ekādasi destroys spiritual merit acquired in three past lives'. This aversion to daśami was probably due to the fact that daśami finds no place in the famous yugmarākya and the pair that is commended is that of ekādasi and dvādasi (and not of ekādasi and daśami). One well-known verse is: Gāndhāri observed a fast on ekādaśī mixed with daśami; her one hundred sons (the Kauravas) perished (in the Bhārata war); therefore one should give up that kind of ekādasi for a fast.291 The Nāradapurāna (pārvārdha, chap. 29) devotes 15 verses to the discussion of Ekādasi and Dvadasi. 

In the Brahmavaivartapurāņa quoted at great length by Hemādri on Kāla (pp. 255-259) four kinds of vedhas of ekādasi by daśami (viz. arunodaya-vedha, ativedha, mahāvedha and Yoga) are mentioned, but they are passed over here. In the case of Vaisnavas, if daśami extends on a civil day beyond 56 ghatikās from sunrise, then ekadasi follows and continues for the whole of the next civil day, there is then what is called Arupodayavedha and Vaisnavas cannot observe a fast on such an ekādaśī which is preceded by Arunodayavedha. The same result follows if daśami extends up to 3, 2 or one ghatikā before sunrise or daśami persists till the exact time when the sun rises and then ekādaśī starts (when there is what is called sūryodaya vedha). A Vaisnava in deciding on what tithi to fast is affected by both arunodayavedha and sūryodayavedha i. e. even if ekādaśī exists for full 60 ghatis after sunrise on a civil day when daśami precedes it by four ghatis, or by three, two or one ghati or when daśami exists for one moment at sunrise and then ekādaśī follows at once, still the Vaisňava cannot observe a fast on the ekādasi of 60 ghatis but only on the next i. e. the 12th. If dvādaśī touches three civil days, then the fast for Vaisnavas

is on the day which is wholly covered by dvādasi and the pāraņā is on the next day when dyādaśī ends. In any cases other than those specified above ekādasi is the fast day and dvādaśī is the pāraṇā day. Nāradapurāņa (pārvārdha, chap. 29 verse 45) pre scribes that if there are two ekādasis, whether in the bright half or dark half, a householder should fast on the earlier of the two and ascetics (yatis) on the later. Sannyāsins and widows are governed by the rules for Vaisnavas. Smārtas (all those who are not Vaisnavas) are not affected by the doctrine of aruņodayavedha but only by sūryodayavedha i. e. if there is daśami before sunrise and an ekādaśī follows from sunrise, smārtas have to observe a fast on the ekādaśī. There are many texts that are apparently in conflict, but the Kālanirnaya (pp. 251-256) and Nirņayasindhu (pp. 37-44) introduce order by showing that some texts refer to Vaişņayas alone, some to Smārtas alone and some to both. The Ekādaśītattva (p. 55) brings together many of the conclu sions about the fast tithi and the pāraṇātithi. 

There are cases where the texts sometimes allow fast on ekādasi oven though mixed with daśami. This occurs when dvadasi does not exist even for a short time on the 13th tithi. But this is allowable only to Smārtas and not to Vaisnavas. Certain restrictions as to food and physical and mental activities had to be observed from the time sankalpa was made to the final ceremonies (pāraņā) in ekādaśīvrata.292 It may be noted that even when a person is in mourning he has to observe ekadasi vrata.293 Certain observances were laid down as common to all vratas (including ekādaśī) viz. forbearance, truthfulness, compassion, charity, purity, restraint of senses, worship of god, homa, contentment and not misappropriating another's wealth.294 There were separate rules to be observed on daśami, ekādasi and dvādaśī (10th tithi to 12th). They are somewhat overlapping. The observances prescribed for daśami are: vegetables, flesh; masūra pulse, eating again (after ekabhakta), sexual intercourse,

The Kūrmapurāņa provides: on the day of vrata one should not touch nor speak nor look at persons that are antyajas (untouchables) and have to live outside the village, a woman recently delivered, one guilty of grave sins and a woman in her 

monthly illness. Devala provides :298 A fast perishes (i. e. all rewards of observing it are lost) by sleep in the day, by play with dice and by sexual intercourse; but in case of great pain (or danger) a fast is not affected by drinking water (frequently). The Rājamārtanda lays down: a man fasting on an Ekādasi should not be guilty of telling a lie, gambling, sleeping by day and sexual intercourse. Hemādri (on vrata vol. I. p. 331) quoting Matsya forbids a bath with oil on ekādasī. A fast is vitiated by drinking water often, by eating tāmbūla, by sleep in day time and by sexual intercourse.

On the 12th the person has to offer worship to Visnu and has to avoid sleeping by day, the food belonging to another person, eating again after the midday meal (on 12th), sexual intercourse, honey, bell-metal vessel, meat, oil. 300 The passage in the note below is practically the same as the one cited from Brahmānda purāņa by Hemādri (on Kāla p. 203) as containing the restric tions about dvādaśı. 

The result of the insistence by Vaisnavas on observing a fast on ekādasi mixed with dvādaśi was often this that in order to be able to observe pāraņā on dvādasi before it ended, they had to get up very early before dawn, take their bath and compress all their morning and midday duties into a short period before sunrise. In modern times many orthodox Vaişpavas do this and rely on the authority of the Nārada 301 and Skanda purānas quoted below. A smṛti 302 text goes so far as to prescribe 'on seeing that dvādasi exists only for half a kalā after nišitha, a (Vaisnava) person should perform all acts proper to be performed up till midday following, because Sankara has so ordered'. Kalā as a measure of time has been variously defined. Matsya (142.4) and Vāyu (100.217-218) say that 30 kalās are equal to a muhurta (i. e. two ghatikās); on the other hand, the Amarakoga holds that 360 kalās constitute a muhurta and the Kālanirnaya

accepts this last. As the astronomers themselves were at variance as to the length of a tithi in question, a plain straight forward rule was proposed that the fast in case of doubt should be observed on dvadasi and the pāraṇā should be observed on the 13th.303 The rank and file of Vaisnavas are very exclusive and bigoted and treat with some contempt everything connected with Siva and some of them eat sumptuous food on Sivarātri, instead of observing a fast. Many of the smārtas generally observe a fast both on the Ekādaśī and the Sivarātri (particularly the Mahasivaratri i.e. on Magha dark 14th). There have been great wrangles and hatreds among Vaisnavas and Saivas. The Brahmapurāņa expressly 304 states that in the holy Puruşottamaksetra a temple of Siya was erected in order to put a stop to the wranglings between Saivas and Bhāgavatas (devotees of Vispu). The higher Hindu thought including even the Purāņa excursions in philosophy always held that there305 is only one God, that the one Brahma that is all Intelligence, that is incapable of being thoroughly comprehended, that is without parts and without body, is imagined to have different visible forms for securing the purposes of devotees and that deities deemed to have visible forms are imagined as male or female or as portions (of the one brahma). The Mahābhārata and some of the Purāņas emphasize that God is one and that there is no difference between Siva and Visnu. 306 Vide Vanaparva 39. 76-77,

Some purāņas 307 put forward the notion that health is secured from the worship of God as) the Sun, wealth from Agni, (true) knowledge from Sankara, and mokṣa from Vişnu. 

Some of the purāņas (such as Brahmavaivarta) specially mention eight kinds of dvādaśīs viz. Unmilani, Vanjuls, Trispršā, Paksavardhini, Jaya, Vijayā, Jayanti and Pāpanāśini. Vide Hemādri on Kala pp. 260-263, H. (on vrata) vol. I. p. 1214, N. S. 43, Sm. K 250–254. Detailed descriptions of these are passed over here. Jaya, 308 Vijayā, Jayanti and Pāpanāśini are dvādaśīs respectively having Punarvasu, Sravana, Rohiņi, Pusya nakşatras. Trisprśā is 309 dvādaśī which spreads over three days i. e. it exists before sunrise on a certain day, then on the whole of the next day from sunrise and for some time (however short) after the latter, On these fast should be observed by those desirous of destruction of sins and attainment of nokşa. 

It would not be out of place to bring together in one place the different items that constitute Ekādaśīvrata. 

On the 10th the performer has a meal at midday (eka bhakta), then he cleans his teeth (not with a twig) but with leaves or by rinsing the mouth twelve times with water. Then on the night of 10th he gives up his evening meal and begins to observe the restrictions indicated above (pp. 115-116). Then on the 11th after getting up he cleanses the body as well as the mind and makes a sankalpa in the morning as described above (pp. 105-106). The sankalpa has to be made at night or in the noon if ekādaśī is viddhā. Then he recites thrice the mantra of eight syllables (om namo Nārāyaṇāya) on the water in the copper vessel in his hands and drinks water therefrom. On the 11th he prepares a

mandapa of flowers, worships the Visnu image therein and offers the several upacāras. He fasts that day. He recites hymns of praise to Vişnu and falls prostrate on the ground in saluta tion. He then keeps awake at night. On the 12th he takes a bath in the morning, offers worship to Hari and dedicates his fast to the God, recites the mantra (Ajñānatimirāndhasya' &c. cited above p. 105) and performs the pārana. This is the general outline of kūmya ekādaśīvrata. In the case of the obligatory fast, the performer should abstain from food the whole day and also keep the several restrictions to be observed on ekādasi (as described above such as not drinking water more than once, not sleeping by day &c). The rules for the followers of Caitanya about ekādaśī as summarised from the Haribhakti vilasa by Prof. S. K. De in 'Vaisnava faith and Movement' on pp. 371-375 do not differ much from those stated above. 

A vrata comes to an end by a rite called udyāpana (carrying out) or pārapa or pāraṇā. The word pārana or pāraṇā is derived by some from the root ‘pāra' meaning 310 'to finish an action or rito'. The word occurs in the drama Sakuntala referred to above on p. 46 and in Raghuvamsa II. 70 ‘prātar-yathoktayrata-pārapānto". Vide for paranā also Raghuvamsa II. 39 and 55. According to the Kūrma-purāna, one should fast on the ekādasi and pāraṇā is to be on the 12th but pāraṇā should not be done on 13th tithi, since that would destroy (the merit) of twelve dvādasis. 311 [n spite of this, pāraṇā on the 13th312 tithi had to be allowed under certain circumstances e. g. if ekādaśī is mixed with daśami on a prior day and with dvādasi on the next day, then the fast is to be on dvādasi but if no dvādaśi at all exists on the day after fast, then pāranā may be on the 13th tithi.

The Pāraņā 

121 

prescribes 'a vrata ends with pāranā and at the end of a vrata, brāhmanas are to be fed; before one vrata is finished one should not commence another'. The general rule is that in all vratas314 the pāranā is in the morning. One should perform the udyāpana as laid down in the texts providing for the vrata concerned; a vrata becomes fruitless if the udyāpana be not performed. If no form of udyāpana is prescribed by the texts, the performer should perform a rite in consonance with the 315 vrata. He should make gifts in proportion to his wealth when no form of udyāpana is mentioned in the texts on a vrata. For making the vrata complete he should donate cows and gold. If none of these can be given and nothing can be done as laid down in the texts, the words of a brāhmaņa alone are sufficient to complete a vrata; but if a man receives the blessed words of brāhmaṇas without giving a dakşiņā (though able), he goes to hell! 

A difficulty may arise owing to the rules that no fresh vrata is to be undertaken till one (prior) vrata is finished and that vrata includes its pāraņā. Suppose, a man has undertaken years ago to observe two vratas, then he may have to observe a fast on ekādaśī and also on dvādasi owing to another vrata already undertaken. Pāranā involves bhojana (taking food). But this is impossible if one has to undergo two fasts succes sively. The remedy is that at the end of the first vrata the performer (who has to undergo two fasts) should sip water. The Voda says that when a man partakes of water it is neither eating nor non-eating 316

CHAPTER VI 

CĀTURMĀSYA 

On Āsādha-sukla ekādaśī or dyādaśī or paurnimā 317 or on the day when the Sun enters the Zodiacal sign Cancer, cāturmāsya vrata is to be observed. Whenever it may be begun it is to be finished on Kārtika-sukla 12. The performer should observe a a fast that day, worship Vişnu (image) and pray as follows: (Garudapurāņa I. 121. 2–3) 'O God! I have undertaken this vrata in your presence; may it succeed without obstacles if you become favourable to me; after I undertake this vrata if I die when it is half-finished, may it become completely fulfilled through your favour'! The yrata may be begun even when Jupiter or Venus has become invisible and the like. The per former has to give up some edible during the four months, viz. vegetables in Srāvana, curds in Bhādrapada, milk in Āśvina and pulses in Kārtika. According to some authorities, he has to give up some or all vegetables for all the four months. The performer is asked to give up many other things also such as sleeping on a cot, meat, honey &c. When the prata is finished, he invites brāhmanas, announces to them what restrictions he had undertaken, feeds them, gives them dakşiņā, and recites the prayer 'O Lord I this vrata was undertaken by me in order to please you; O Janārdana! may it become complete through your favour, whatever defect there may be!' This yrata is even now observed, particularly by women. The Krtyatattva (p. 435), Vratārka, Vrataprakāśa (folio 105a) and other medieval digests quote long passages from the Matsya, Bhavisyottara (1. 6-9) and other purāņas about the results of giving up certain things in the Cāturmāsyayrata. A few passages are set out for sample: 'a man secures a sweet voice by giving up jaggery, has charm ing limbs by giving up oil, by giving up ghee he secures beauty, by giving up fruits he becomes intelligent and has many sons, by giving up vegetables and leaves he secures well-cooked

In the Vedic period there were sacrifices called Cāturmāsyas (seasonal sacrifices) that were performed on the Full Moon days of Phālguna (or Caitra), of Āsādha and Kārtika and were respectively called Vaišvadeva, Varuņapraghāsa and Sākamedha (the fourth called Sunāsiriya need not detain us). Vide H. of Dh, vol. II. pp. 1091–1106. It was expressly stated by Apastamba Srauta VIII. 4. 13 that Vaišvadeva (parvan of Cāturmāsya) was to be offered in vasanta and Varuņapraghāsa in the rainy season. It may be noted that the sacrificer in these seasonal sacrifices had to keep certain observances such as sleeping on the ground,319 avoiding meat, honey, salt, sexual intercourse and bodily decorations, which closely resemble the restrictions laid on the person observing Ekādasiyrata. The Yājñavalkya-smrti 320 (I. 125) makes it obligatory on a person of means to offer & Soma sacrifice every year, a paśubandha in each ayana, the Āgrayanesti (performed when new crops are ready) and the cāturmāsyas. The cāturmāsyas meant here are the Vedic ones mentioned above and not the Paurāpika yratas of cāturmāsya. 

The Yājñavalkya-smrti employs the word vrata in the sense of prāyaścitta in III. 251, 252, 254, 266, 269, 282, 298, 300, in the sense of 'brahmacarya' in III, 15, and in the sense of the food to be subsisted upon in III, 289, but hardly ever in the sense of a rite to be observed on a tithi or week day or nakşatra as in the purāṇas. This at least indicates that the vratas mentioned in the purānas had not attained prominence in the time of the Yājñavalkya-smrti, which, in spite of its containing over 1000 verses, hardly ever refers to any vrata in the sense of the purānas.

CHAPTER VII 

Vratas called Nāgapañcami, Manasāpūjā, 

Raksābandhana, Krsnajanmāştami 

In the month of Srāvana there are several important yratas, one of which is Nāgapañcami on the 5th of the bright half of Śrāvana. The Nāgapañcami is observed in different ways in all parts of India. Some hold that, instead of Aksayyatrtiyā, Nāgapañcami is the one half auspicious day out of 3} most auspicious days in the year. The Bhavisyapurāpa, Brāhma parva (chapter 32 verses 1-39), expatiates on Nāgapañcami. Krtyakalpataru (on vrata) pp. 87-90 and Hemādri (on vrata vol. I. pp. 557-560) quote several verses from the Bhavisya purāna. Briefly, the Bhavisya 321 says: when men on the 5th bathe with milk the nāgas called Vāsuki, Taksaka, Kaliya, Mani bhadra, Airāyata, Dhrtarāstra, Karkotaka and Dhanañjaya, these give abhaya (freedom from danger) to their families. A legend is told (in Bhavisya I. 32) that Kadrū, mother of nāgas, laid a bet with her sister Vinatā about the colour of the tail of Indra's horso called Uccaih-śravas, Kadrū asserting that the tail was black though the horse was white and Vinatā saying that the body and tail were white and when the nāgas refused to practise the deceit whereby they were to become the dark hair in the horse's tail, Kadrū cursed them that fire would burn them in the sarpasattra of Janamejaya). Persons should make golden, silver or clay images of nāgas, should worship them with Karavira and Jāti flowers and incense etc., feed brāhmaṇas with ghee, pāyasa etc. and should bathe nāgas with milk. The result would be that nāgas would bestow on the worshippers safety (from spake-bite). The Bhavisyottarapurāna (chap. 36) contains another method. On Srāvapa 5th (bright half) a person should draw on both sides

It appears that in Bengal and south India (but not in Mahārāstra) there is worship of Manasādevi in one's own court yard on a branch of the snuhi plant on the 5th of Srāvana dark half. The Rājamārtanda has four verses, one of which is quoted below. Samayapradipa and Krtyaratnākara refer to the worship of Manasādevī. The Tithitattva322 (p. 33) contains the dhyāna of Manasādevī taken from Padmapurāņa. First, there is a sankalpa 323 about the worship of Manasādevī in order to get rid of the danger from snake-bite, then one offers gandha, flowers, incense, lamp and naivedya and then Ananta and other nāgas are offered worship, the principal item being naivedya of milk and ghee. Nimba leaves are placed inside the house and the performer eats them and also makes brāhmaṇas eat them. The Brahmavaivartapurāņa (II) devotes two chapters (45-46) to the birth of Manasādevī, her pūjā and stotra (praise) &c. Dr. Sukumar Sen has edited in the B. I. series Vipradāsa's 'Manasāvijaya'. 

In the Deccan on Śrāvana bright half 5th figures of snakes are drawn with red sandalwood paste on wooden boards, or clay images of snakes coloured yellow or black are purchased and worshipped and given milk and snake charmers go about with snakes of all sorts, to which people offer milk and some money is paid to the snake charmers.

History of Dharmaśāstra 

(Sec. I, Ch. VII 

If pañcami is mixed with the 4th and 6th tithis, that mixed with the 6th is to be preferred. The Vratakālaviveka 324 speaks of Manasāvrata on Jyestha-sukla 10th with Hasta-nakşatra or without it and remarks that when this yrata is performed Manasā goddess protects a man from the danger of poisonous snakes. 

How and when serpent worship arose in India is a difficult problem. The Rgveda contains no reference to snake worship. On the contrary the Vedio god Indra is said to be the killer of ahi (a serpent) in Rg. II. 30. 1, II. 19. 3 and the slaughter of ahi is frequently mentioned as in Rg. I. 165. 6, III, 47 4. That ahi meant a serpent with a hood is clear from Rg. VI. 75. 14 (ahiriya bhogaih paryeti bāhum). In Br. Up. IV. 4.7 and Prašna IV. 5 there are references to the cast-off slough of serpents (mentioned as 'padodara' whose feet are inside its body ) and in Rg. IX. 86. 44 ( ahir na jūrņāmati sarpati tvacam) also. But, in many passages of the Rgveda (such as I. 32. 11) ahi appears to have a metaphorical sense and refers to a demon like Vrtra that prevented waters from flowing down. In the Tai. S. IV. 2. 8. 3. and Vāj. S. (XIII. 6-8) there are three verses that contain salutations to serpents. In the Atharvaveda (VIII. 14. 13-15) there is a reference to serpents some of which like Takşaka and Dhrtarāstra are named. The Kāthaka S. V. 6 enumerates the pitrs, sarpas, gandharvas, waters and herbs as pancajana, and the Ait. Br. XIII. 7 asserts that gods, men, gandharvas, apsarases, snakes and pitřs were pañcajana. This cannot be the meaning of 'pañcajanāḥ' in Rg. X. 53. 4. The above passages show that sarpas had come to be a clan like gandharyas in late vedic times. 

In the Āśv. gr. II. 1. 1-15, the Paraskara-gļhya II. 14 and other grhya sūtras a rite called 'sarpabali' (offering to serpents) was performed on the Full Moon day of Srāvana. Vide H. of Dh. vol II. pp. 821-823 for a description. The nāgas figure frequently in the Mahābhārata. Vide Ādi. chap. 35 enumerat ing the names of many nāgas beginning with Sesa and chap. 123. 71, Udyoga 103. 9-16 (naming numerous nāgas).

the country of the Nāgas (probably a tribe that had nāga as their emblem) and took as his wife Ulūpi, a Nāga princess who was smitten by love. Babhruvāhana, son of Citrāngadā, fought with Arjuna who had come to Manipura for protecting the Ašvamedha horse, was killed by Babhruvāhana and restored to life with the help of a Sanjivana jewel (Āśvamodhikaparva chap. 79-81). Serpents came to be associated with both Vişņu and Siva. Vispu is said to sleep on the hoods of Seşa-nāga (Vanaparva 203. 12 and 272. 38–39) and Siva wears serpents on his body like yajñopavita (Anušāsana 14. 55). 325 In the Bhagavadgitā X. 28-29 Lord Krsna identifies himself with Vāsuki among serpents and Ananta among nāgas. What difference is made between 'sarpa' and 'nāga' is not clear. Probably 'sarpa' means all creeping things, while nāga means 'the cobra'. The Puranas are full of stories about nāgas. Vide J. Ph. Vogel's painstaking work (Indian Serpent Lore, 1926) based on the Mahābhārata, the Purāṇas and the Rājatarangipi. It appears that serpent worship arose gradually from the fear of serpents that must have taken a heavy toll of life, particularly at the beginning of the rainy season. Even in these days about 10000 people die of snake bite every year in India, while persons killed by all wild animals are hardly 3000. Why the tithi was changed from Full Moon (for Sarpabali in the gļhya sūtras) to the 5th of the bright half is not clear. It may be due to the slight change in the time of the onset of rains owing to the procession of the equinoxes. Vide Fergusson's Tree and Serpent worship’ pp. 1-75 and Plate XV which reproduces the sculptures on the eastern gateway of Sanchi, where occurs the figure of five-headed Nāga. Stone images of serpents under sacred trees like pippala are common in the Dravida country and a few temples dedicated to nāgas exist such as the one at Battis Shirālen in Satara District and at Bhom-parānden in Hyderabad. 

On the Full Moon of Srāvana there is in the afternoon a ceremony called Raksābandhana (tying the protective amulet). It is described by Hemādri on vrata, vol. II, pp. 190–195, N. 8. p. 121, P.C. 284-285, Vratārka (folio 335a-336a). One should at sunrise on Full Moon of Śrāyaṇa and after offering tarpaņa to gods, sages and pitrs, get prepared a protective packet (or amulet) containing whole rice grains and mustard and deco

rated with gold (thread) and strung together with variously coloured threads and have such an amulet tied. In the case of a king, a jar should be placed on a square raised in the palace and the king should occupy his seat together with his ministers, he should be surrounded by courtesans and music and benedictory words should go forth; gods, brāhmaṇas and arms should be first honoured, then the royal 326 priest should tie the amulet to the accompaniment of the mantra. 'I tie on you that whereby Bali, the very powerful king of demons, was bound; O protective (amulet), don't slip off, don't slip off.' All including sūdras and other human beings should get the amulet tied after honouring priests according to ability. When this is done, a man lives on happily for a year. Hemādri quotes Bhavisyottara for the story that Indrāni tied on the right hand of Indra a protective amulet whereby he was enabled to vanquish the asuras. This tying should not be done when paurnimā is mixed up with either 14th or the following pratipad. It may, in order to avoid these two, be done even at night. 

This ceremony of tying an amulet on the right wrist is still in vogue and priests go about tying these amulets and receive somne fee for doing so. Mukerji (p. 81) is unduly harsh on the poor brāhmaṇas when he says that it is a day of blackmail by the priests. Women in Gujarat and some other places tie silken amulets round the wrists of their brothers and give and receive presents. 

On the Full Moon day of Śrāvaņa it is usual on the sea coast of western India (particularly in Konkan and Malabar) not only for Hindus, but also for Moslems and Parsis of the merchant class to go to the sea and offer flowers and a cocoanut to the sea. The sea becomes less rough and the violence of the monsoon winds abates after the Full Moon of Srāvana and the cocoanut is offered to the sea god (Varupa) in order that he may make sea voyage for vessels of merchandise safe. 

In Śrāvana on the 8th of the dark half is celebrated the Krspajanmāstami or Janmāstami vrata and festival, which is probably the most important vrata and utsava celebrated throughout the whole of India.

Antiquity of Kršņa worship 





129 

In some Purāņa passages it is declared that Janmāstami is celebrated on the 8th of the dark half of Bhādrapada. The explanation is that in those passages the months are Pūrṇimānta and the dark half is in these months the first paksa.327 The Padma (III, 13), Matsya 56, Agni 183 contain numerous verses on the greatness (māhātmya) of Krsnajanmāstami. 

It would not be out of place to say a few words about Kșsņa and about the antiquity of Krsna worship. There is a reference in the Chāndogya-upanisad (III. 17. 6) to Krsna Devakīputra receiving instruction from Ghora Angirasa. There was a Vedic poet named Krsna who calls upon the Asvins to listen to his invocation in æg. VIII. 85. 3 and the Anukramani assigns Rg. VIII. 86-87 to Krsna Angirasa. Jain tradition regards Krsna as contemporaneous with Nemi, the 22nd Tirthankara, and from the account of the 63 great men of Jain pre-history about one third are shown as associated with Kșsņa. The life of Krsna as gathered from the Mahābhārata is a composite one. In some passages he is depicted as a Yādava prince, the staunchest friend of the Pāndavas 328 (and particularly of Arjuna), as a great warrior, statesman and philosopher. In other passages he is identified with the Supreme Lord of the worlds and as Vispu Himself (Sānti 47. 28, Droņa 146. 67–68, Karna 87.74, Vanaparva 49. 20, Bhīşma 21. 13-15). There are most sublime praises of Krsna put in the mouths of Yudhisthira (Droņa 149. 16-33), Draupadi (Vanaparva 263. 8-16) and Bhisma when about to die (Anušāsana 167. 37-45). We have further information about him from the Harivamsa, the Visnupurāņa, Vāyu (98.100-102). the Bhāgavata and Brahmavaivarta that deal with Krspa's romantic career among cowherds, which is wanting in the Mahabharata.

History of Dharmaśāstra 

[ Sec. I, Ch. VII 

It appears from Pāṇini (IV. 3. 98 ) 329 that there were people in his day described as Vāsudevaka and Arjunaka that were devoted to Vasudeva and Arjuna. Patañjali in his Mahābhāsya mentions several persons and incidents connected with Krspa. On Vārtika 6 to Pān. III. 1. 26 the Mahābhāsya gives two examples 'Kamsam ghātayati' (meaning 'he tells the story of the slaughter of Kamsa') and 'Balim bhandhayati' (meaning 'he narrates the story of the imprisonment of Bali'). In Vārtika 2 to Pāp. III. 1.138 the word 'Govinda' is derived from got vinda). On Vārtika 2 to Pān. III. 2. 111 Patañjali gives the example ‘Jaghāna Karsam kila Vāsudevah' (Vāsudeva, they say, killed Kamsa) and implies that the incident occurred long ago which the speaker could not have seen but was popularly known.330 This is a cuarter of an Upendravajrā or Upajāti verse. Patañjali names Satyabhāmā with its shortened form Bhāmā (Kielhorn, vol. I. p. 111), the words 'Vasudevavargyah' and 'Akrūravargyah' occur (on Vārtika 11 on Pāṇ. IV.2.104). On Pāņ. IV. 1.114 (rsyardhaka vrsni-kurubhyas-ca) under vārtika y Patañjali mentions Ugrasena as a scion of the Andhakas and Vāsudeva and Bāladeva of the Vrsnis. Patañjali quotes half of an Anustubh verse 'Sankarşana-dvitiyasya balam Krsnasya vardhatām' (Kielhorn's ed. vol. I. p. 426). Patañjali is regarded by most modern scholars as having flourished in the 2nd century B. C. (about 150 B. C.). Therefore it follows that some poetic work or works that referred to incidents, of Krsna's career (such as Kamsavadha) had been composed some centuries before the Christian era. Vide I, A. Vol. III. pp. 14-16 for allusions to Krspa in the Mahābhāsya and I. A. vol. XIV pp. 326 ff, for verse quotations in the Mahābhāsya collected by Kielhorn. In the Adiparva (chap. 1. 256)331 and in Sabhā 33, 10-11 Krsņa is identified with Vāsudeva and is said to be the Highest Brahma

330. The passage about the killing of Kamsa is interesting: TEO कथं वर्तमानकालता कंसं घातयति बलिं बन्धयतीति चिरहते कंसे चिरबद्धे च बलौ' (महाभाष्य ed, by Kielhorn, vol. II. p. 36). This shows that in the time of the HĘTH16 the killing of Kamsa (by Krsoa) was supposed to have taken place io hoary antiquity. Patañjali states further on that Kamsavadha was represented dramatically, that pictures were painted about it and lastly that works had been composed narrating that event.

and the source of the universe. The Ghosundi inscription of 2nd or 1st century B. C. mentions the hall of worship of Sankar saņa and Vāsudeva (E. I. 16 pp. 25-27, E. I, 22 p. 198, I. A. vol. 61 p. 203) addressed as 'Bhagavat' and 'sarveśvara'. Nanaghat cave inscriptions of about 200 B. C. mention both (A.S. W. I, vol. V pp. 60–74). The Besnagar column (Garuda-dhvaja ) Vaisnava inscription 332 where the Bhagavata Heliodorus, son of Diya, hailing from Taksasilā and Yavana ambassador of king Antalikita (Antalkidas) to king Bhāgabhadra mentions Vāsudeva as 'devadera'. The preceding items of evidence indicate that the worship of Vasudeva was prevalent in northern and central India from at least 500 B. C.. if not earlier. Vide R. G. Bhandarkar's “Vaisnavism, Saivism &c.' pp. 1-45 for the various phases of the Krsna cult and its antiquity. 

It is rather surprising that the passages quoted in the medieval works on Krsnajanmāstami are mostly borrowed from the Bhavisya, Bhavisyottara, Skanda, Vişnudharmottara, Nāradiya and Brahmavaivarta purāņas, but hardly ever from the Bhāgavata-purāṇa which is the Veda of the Vaispavas of later medieval and modern times. The description of Krsna's birth in the Bhāgavata is vague and commonplace. All that 333 is said there is that the time when Krsna was born was ondowed with all good characteristics and was very charming, that the quarters looked very clear and the sky was lit up by bright stars, that the wind that blew was very pleasing to the skin and laden with fine fragrance and that when Janārdana was born of Devaki it was midnight and darkness had enveloped everything. 

In the Bhavisyottara (44.1-69) Kțşpa himself is represented as narrating to Yudhisthira the incidents of Janmāstami-vrata: 'I was born of Vasudeva and Devaki on the 8th of Bhādrapada dark half at midnight when the Sun was in Lion (Leo), when the

Moon was in the sign of the Bull (Taurus) and there was Rohiņi naksatra' (verses 74-75), when on the 8th of the dark half of Sravana there is Rohini-naksatra, the tithi is called Jayanti; if a man observes a fast on that tithi, that destroys his sins committed in childhood, youth, old age and many previous lives.' The result is that if there be no Rohiņi naksatra on Śrāvana dark half sth, it is simply Janmāstamī, but when Rohini is joined to dark 8th of Srāvaņa it is Jayanti. The Rājamārtanda has two verses on this.334 

The important question is whether the Janmāstami-prata and Jayanti-vrata are really only one vrata or whether they are two separate vratas. The Kalanirnaya,335 after a long discus sion in which Mimamsa principles contained in Jai. II. 2.23 and IV. 1. 22-24 are relied upon, arrives at the conclusion that the two are separate yratas on the grounds that the two names are different (viz. Janmāstami-vrata and Jayantiyrata), their occa sions (nimitta) are different (the first depends only on dark Aştami, while the latter exists only if there is Rohiņi on 8th of dark half of Srāvana) and their characteristics are different in that in Janmāştamīvrata sāstra requires only a fast, while in Jayantivrata the śāstra requires a fast and also gifts and the like. Besides, Janmastamivrata is obligatory (nitya), since the texts only speak of the incurring of sin if it be not performed, while Jayantīvrata is both nitya and kūmya in that the śāstras connect it with special rewards in addition to the incurring of sin by its non-observance. Further, the two are separately

mentioned in the same verses.336 Hemādri, Madanaratna, the Nirnayasindhu (p. 126) and several works hold the view that the two are different. But the N. S. notes 337 that in its day people observed only Janmāstami-vrata and not Jayanti-vrata. On the other hand the Jayantinirnaya (p. 25) states that people generally celebrate Jayanti only (and not Janmāstami). This variance is probably due to the fact that the two works (N, S. and J. N.) belong to the north and south of India. The Samaya mayūkha 338 and Puruşārthacintīmaņi (p. 117 ) very severely criticize the views of Madhava set out above from the Kāla nirņaya, one of the principal arguments in these last being that the Mimāṁsā rules relied upon by Madhava apply to rites, but Jayanti is the name of a tithi i. e. the 8th of dark half when conjoined to Rohiņī. The Jayantinirņaya of Hārīta Venkata nātha holds that the two are different and that both are nitya as well as kāmya (pp. 4-5 and p. 30). It further points out (p. 19) that in Janmāstamīvrata tithi is the principal matter while in Jayanti it is the nakşatra (Rohiņi) that is principal. 

Two discordant notes are struck by the Varāha-purāna and by the Harivamsa. The former says 339 that Krsna was born on 12th of Asadha bright half. According to the Harivamsaq. by Hemādri and Jimātavāhana, the naksatra was Abhijit when Krsna was born and the muhūrta was vijaya 340. It is quite

possible that these two represent some older traditions about the date of the birth of Krsna. 

Another important point very much canvassed in the medieval digests is about the exact tithi and time when the Janmāstamīvrata is to be celebrated. The K. N. (pp. 215-224), Kṛtyatattva pp. 438-444, Tithitattva pp. 47-51, Samaya mayūkha p. 50-51, N. S. pp. 128–130 and several other digests state certain conclusions about this. 

It is clear from almost all Purānas and other works on Janmāstami that the principal time for the celebration of the birth of Krsna is the midnight 341 of the 8th of Srāvana dark half (Bhādrapada dark, if the month is Purnimānta). This tithi is of two kinds viz. (1) without Rohiņi naksatra and (2) with Rohiņi naksatra. In each of these two, the Kālanirnaya of Madhava (pp. 218-224), the Nirnayasindhu (pp. 128-130 ), the Dharmasindhu (pp. 64-67 ) and other digests set out several possible alternative combinations. The Nirnayāmsta (pp. 56 58) mentions as many as 18 kinds, eight of the suddhū tithi, 8 of the viddhā tithi and two more, one being the one where Robiņi. naksatra is there at midnight and the other being Navami joined to Robiņi and having either Wednesday or Monday. A discussion of these would be somewhat complicated and hardly otherwise than of academical interest to modern readers. There fore, all these alternatives are not set out here. Instead, the brief conclusions put forth by the Tithitattva are given 342 by way of sample. These are: If Jayanti (Aştami with Robiņi) exists only a single day, the fast must be observed on that very day; if it spreads over two days, then the fast is on the later of the two; if there is no Jayanti, then the fast is to be observed on Astami joined with Rohiņi; if two days have Astami joined to Robiņi, then fast is on the later of the two; if there is no Rohiņi nakşatra then fast is to be observed on the Aştami that exists at midnight or if astami exists on two days at midnight or if it be not existent at midnight then on the later day.

If Jayanti fast occurs on Wednesday or Monday there are far greater results and such a fast is superior to crores of other vratas and the man who observes a fast on Jayanti conjoined to Wednesday or Monday would not be born again.343 

The main items in Janmāstamīvrata are fast, worship of Krspa, jāgara ( keeping awake at night, listening to and repeat ing hymns of praise and stories about Krsna's exploits), pāraṇā. 

The medieval digests such as Tithitattva (pp. 42-47), the Samayamayūkha (pp. 52-57), Kālatattvayivecana (pp. 52-56), Vratarāja (pp. 274–277), Dharmasindhu (pp. 68-69) contain a lengthy procedure of Janmāstamīvrata based principally on Bhavisyottara chap. 55. A brief summary from the first two works (which agree in the main in most respects) is set out below. 

On the day of the fast in the morning the devotee should invoke the presence of the Sun, Moon, Yama, Time, the two twilights, the (five) elements, Day and Night, Wind, the lord of the quarters, the earth, the sky, the denizens of aerial regions and gods.344 He should hold in his hand a copper vessel filled with water, some fruits, flowers and whole rice-grains, refer to the month &c. and make a sankalpa ‘I shall perform the Krsņāstami-vrata, for securing a certain reward or for the removal of my sins'. He then repeats four mantras addressed to Vāsudeva, one of which is quoted below.345 After repeating the mantras he should dis charge the water in the vessel. He should construct a delivery hall for Devakī having auspicious jars full of water and mango leaves, garlands of flowers, fragrant with burnt aguru and

Round about the room or the walls (of the room) he should paint gods and gandharvas with folded hands, Vasudeva with a drawn sword, Devaki, Nanda, Yaśodā, gopis, Kainsa's guards, the river Yamunā and the snake Kāliya therein and other incidents of Gokula as far as he could. He should place in the delivery hall a bed surrounded by screens. He should take a bath with sesame in the noon in the water of a river or the like and at midnight make the sankalpa, 'I shall perform the worship of Krsna with his attendants'; he should make an image of Krsna of gold or silver &c., touch the cheeks of the image and vitalize the image (prāņa-pratisthā) with mantras. He should contem plate upon Devaki (with a mantra) and on Srikrsna lying as an infant on the bed and offer worship to Lakşmi, to Vasudeva and Devaki, Nanda and Yaśoda, Baladeva and Candikā with appropriate mantras for bath, for incense, naivedya &c.; he then briefly performs symbolically the ceremonies of Jātakarma, cutting the navel chord, Sasthīpājā and nāmakarana. Then at time of moonrise (at or a little after midnight) he should offer arghya on an altar or to (image of) the moon with Rohiņi with water from a conch mixed with flowers, kuśas and sandalwood paste with a mantra, should bow to the moon and prostrat 346 himself with several verses containing the different names of Vasudeva and at the end address prayers to him. Then he should keep awake the whole night in listening to the hymns of praise to Krşņa, to the stories in the Puranas and in songs, music and dances. Next day after performing all usual acts to be performed in the morning and again offering worship to the image of God Krsna, he should feed brāhmanas and donate to them gold, cow, clothes with the words 'May Krsna be pleased with me'. He should then repeat the mantra 347 'salutation to him who is Brahma, who is Vasudeva of blessed birth and beneficent to cows and brāhmanas and whom Devaki gave birth

from Vasudeva for the protection of Vedas spread over the earth. Let there be peace! Let there be bliss! He should then take out the image of Krsna, donate it to a brāhmaṇa and bring the yrata to a close after performing pāraṇā. 

The procedure in the Dharmasindhu (pp. 68-69) is more elaborate than the above, though no essential difference exists. It makes use of Vedic mantras (from Rg. X. 90. 1-16) along with Paurāņika mantras, while in the Samaya-mayukha and Tithi tattva no Vedic mantra is expressly mentioned. As regards jāgara the Dharmasindhu provides that the stories 348 about Krsna may be made striking by reciting poems composed in regional languages, that Vedic hymns may have at their end Paurāņika stories rocited, that visual representations (such as dances) may be resorted to, that this is a procedure meant for the three higher varnas, but in the case of śūdras it is not proper to follow the same procedure; they should omit Vedic hymns but may engage in music and Paurāņika recitations. 

One question often raised in some of the medieval digests on Dharmaśāstra is: what is the principal matter in Janmāstaml vrata. Some held that both fast (upavāsa) and worship (pājā) are principal and they rely on a Bhavisyapurāņa 349 passage 'when at midnight on the 8th of the dark half there is Rohini, worship of Krsna destroys sins committed in three lives; a man observing a fast then and performing worship of Hari does not sink'. The Samayamayūkha, after an elaborate discussion in which Mimāṁsā doctrines such as those in Jai. I. 4. 1-3 are employed, arrives at the conclusion that the fast is only an auxiliary (anga), while worship (pūjā) is the principal thing. On the other hand the Tithitattva350 relying on the verse of the

Bhavisya opening the description of the vrata 'On that day one should accept the restrictions of upavāsa' and also Mimāmgā doctrines holds that upavāsa is the principal matter and pūjā is an anga (auxiliary matter). The Jayantīnirnaya contained in the Dasanirnayi of Hārīta Venkatanātha discusses at length the two (pp. 3 ff). This subject need not be pursued much further. 

It has already been stated above that every vrata requires a pāraṇa as the last item, that pārana takes place the day after the day of the fast and that it is generally performed in the morning. There are certain special rules about the pāraṇa of Janmāştami fast and Jayanti fast. A few dicta of the purāņas may be first noted. The Brahmavaivarta 351 states 'one should never perform pārana while astami tithi is running or Rohini naksatra is still there on the Astami; (if one does so) one destroys what he has done previously and the fruits acquired by the fast. A tithi destroys eight-fold, while a naksatra does so fourfold; therefore one should perform the pārana (of Janmāstami) at the end of the tithi and naksatra'. The Nāradapurāņa 352 remarks when a fast has to be observed on the conjunction of a tithi and nakşatra, pārapa should not be done until at least one of the two has ended; when a vrata falls on a conjunction (of tithi and nakşatra), pāraṇa should be done only when one of the two is Beparated (i. e. ends)'. The Vahni-purāņa provides pārana is commended at the end of the nakşatra or at the end of the tithi'. Both the Tithitattva and the Krtyatattva 353 arrive on interpret ing these and other verses at the following conclusions. 'Pāraṇa is to be observed on the day after the fast, but after the end of the tithi (astami) and the naksatra (Rohini); but when one of

the two ends before mahāniśā and the other during mahānisā or after it, pāraṇa should be observed at the end of one of the two; when both exist during the period of mahāniśā then one should perform pārana in the morning at the end of the festival'. At the end of the pārana the performer repeats the mantra 'salutations to Govinda, who is Being, who is the ruler of (all) beings, who is the lord of (all) beings and who is the source of all beings'.354 The above statement shows that in certain cases the pārana of Janmāstamiyrata may be at night,355 particularly for vaisnavas who perform the vrata ag a duty and not for any reward. 

There is a difference of meaning between udyāpana and pārana. Some yratas like Ekādasi and Janmāstams are per formed throughout a man's life; in such cases there is only pārapa after the fast on every occasion that a fast is observed. If a man undertakes a vrata only once and finishes it, then the concluding rites of the vrata are called udyāpana. 

Besides the items mentioned above, it is the practice, parti cularly of boys and common people in Mahārāşțra, to hang up pots full of curds and buttermilk on the day after the birth of Krspa is celebrated, to play underneath the pot, sing songs and then pierce the pot and get drenched by curds and buttermilk running out from the holes made. This is probably due to the legends associated with Krsna's boyhood among cowherds. The Bhāgavata 356 expressly says that the cowherds sprinkled each other on Kssna's birth with curds, milk, ghee, and smeared each other with these. This is called 'Gopālakālā in Mahārāstra. But this is not observed in other parts of India such as Saurastra. Surprisingly enough the Krspajanmāstaml festival does not, like the Rāmanavami festival, figure in the Kṛtya kalpataru on vrata. One cannot account for this omission.

(Sec. I, Ch. VII 

But in the Naiyatakāla section 357 of the same work, a brief procedure of Krsnajanmāstami (which is word for word the same in the Krtyaratnākara) different from the one specified above from the Tithitattva and other works, is set out. It is as follows: On the 8th of the dark half of Bhadrapada was born in Kaliyuga in the 28th (kalpa?), Krsna, son of Devaki, for removing the burden (of the earth) and the reduction of ksatriyas. He (his image) should therefore be worshipped on that day, as also (of) Devaki and Yasodā with sandalwood paste, flowers, incense, various fruits and foods and dishes prepared from barley and wheat together with cow's milk. At night the devotee should keep awake with songs and dances. Then on the 9th about the time of arunodaya (4 ghatikās before sunrise ) women dressed in red clothes and decked with garlands of flowers should carry the images of these (Krsna, Devakī and Yaśodā) to a holy river bank or to a charming and unfrequented lake, wherein they should themselves take their bath and also bathe the images; then returning home they should eat a meal of barley together with jaggery, honey, ghee and black pepper. 

Before closing this account of Janmāstami reference must be made to a paper read in 1867 before the Berlin Akademie der Wissenschaften by the renowned German scholar, Prof. A. Weber. The subject of the paper was 'An investigation into the origin of the festival of Krsnajanmāstami' and the paper was divided into four parts; the first dealt with the sources (an English translation of it by E. Rehatsek was published in Indian Antiquary vol. VI. pp. 161-180 and pp. 281-301 ), the 2nd dealt with ritual, the 3rd part was the most important and was con cerned with a novel theory, viz. the ritual of Krşnāstami festival was something transferred from outside of India, that the description in the ritual of Krsna's image as suckling at the mother's (Devaki's) breast was the keystone of the theory of this ritual as of foreign origin and that it was suggested by pictorial representations of the Madonna with a suckling child (Christ)

Weber's theory about Janmāştami 

141 

&c. An English translation of this part appeared in Indian Antiquary, vol. III. pp. 21-25 and pp. 47–52. This paper, though it is a monument of learning and patient industry (for that period when very few Sanskrit books had been printed ), gave rise to severe criticism owing to its fantastic and perverse conclusion about Krsnajanmāstami ritual being borrowed from Christian representations of Christ and his mother Mary. In I. A, vol. III. p. 300 Growse attacked it very severely. In spite of all criticisms the tenacious German scholar stuck to his guns and launched an attack against his critics, particularly against Dr. Rajendralal Mitra, in I. A. vol. IX. pp. 226-229. As hardly any Sanskrit scholar in these days would espouse the theory put forward by Weber, I do not think that I should waste much time over a refutation thereof. Most European scholars, nurtured on the vaunted intellectual eminence of the ancient Greeks and on the intolerant attitude of christianity towards other faiths, when they became acquainted with things Indian and studied Sanskrit, were obsessed (though not very obviously expressed) by two notions, viz. much in India that resembled what prevailed in the West must have been borrowed from the West and further, that Indians, who had allowed themselves to be invaded by outsiders and governed by foreigners for centuries, must not have been good at anything. These two notions gave rise to many untenable theories such as the following: the Rāmāyana was borrowed from Homer's Iliad, the art of writing was un known to Pāṇini, the Brāhmi script was based on Phoenician or Aramaic script, that the Gītā was based on the Bible, that the very ancient Indian naksatra system was borrowed either from the Chinese, the Babylonians or Arabs. Most of such theories were the result of little knowledge and the non-recognition of certain common sense rules and have now been consigned to the limbo of deserved oblivion. The common sense rule is that when a thing or a state of things has existed for centuries in a certain country or among a certain people, the burden of proving that it was borrowed by that country or people from outside is very heavy on those who assert such borrowing; mere similarities can never he held to amount to any evidence of borrowing at all; scholars should be very chary of confidently asserting borrowing and should put forward their conclusions very cauti ously. It would not be irrelevant to point out the main circum stances on which Weber, often a champion of lost causes, relied for his theory. 

142 

History of Dharmaśāstra 

(Sec. I, Ch. VII 

The first is that in the ritual of Krspāstami contained in some digests (that said that they borrowed the passage from Bhavisyottara) the image of Krsna was to be shown 358 as suckl. ing at the breast of Devaki, that this is a unique direction, that in the Ramanavami festival which is similar to Janmāstami the image of Rāma is not required to be suckling at the breast of Kausalyā, that this detail was copied from the representation of the Madonna Lactans. Weber relied (vide I. A. vol. III p. 51 ) on ono De Bossi who said that pictures of infant Christ at the breast existed in 2nd century A. D. Weber brushed aside the testimony of other scholars that the Madonna with the child was a subject little known to the early christian centuries and the opinion of other scholars that the representations of the Madonna Lactang are extremely rare in Byzantine and Russian art (I. A. vol. III p. 48) and almost always of very late date. Weber makog a mountain of a molehill. The image of Rāma is also described as lying on the lap of the mother Kausalyā.359 Further, all purāņas do not provide that the image of Kyspa was to be suckling at the breast. Hemādri, in describing the Jayantiyrata from the Purānas, shows that the image was to be on the lap of the mother Devaki.360 Was the Hindu imagination so poor that when they could describe the image of Rāma or Krsna as lying on the mother's lap they could not also imagine that it could be shown as suckling at the breast and had to run to the West to copy that detail from representations of the Madonna and the child thousands of miles away? 

The 2nd point made much of by Weber was that Nārada is represented as having brought from Sveta-dvipa ( white land) the doctrine of salvation by faith. Weber holds that Svetadvipa was Alexandria, while Lassen holds that it was Parthia. If we read the description of Svetadvipa in the śāntiparva ( chapters

336-339 ) and in such Purānas 361 as Vāmana (chap. 25.16 and 60. 56) and Kūrma (I. 49) it would be clear that Svetadvipa was an imaginary or mythical place where everything was white, where Vişnu and the gods dwelt and that it had no earthly existence at least in the minds of the authors who wrote the above works. 

The third important point according to Weber was that certain incidents in Krsna's life such as Kāliya-mardana are similar to those in Christianity. Weber himself says that victory over Kāliya is a travesty of the christian tradition of the serpent. It appears to me that there is nothing common between the two except the word serpent.

CHAPTER VIII 

Vratas of Haritālikā, Ganesacaturthi, 

Rsipañcami, Anantacaturdaśī. 

On the 3rd tithi of the bright half of Bhadrapada occurs the Haritālikāvrata for women alone. This vrata is not found in the Krtyakalpataru on vrata or in Hemādri. It is described only in the later medieval digests like the Nirnayasindhu (p. 133), Vratārka (folios 44 6-49 b), Vratarāja (pp. 103-110) and Abalyākāmadhenu (folios 282-295). It may, however, be noted that the Rājamārtanda of Bhoja (first half of 11th century A.D.) devotes four verses to Haritālicaturthi on Bhadrapada 4th of bright half and says it is dear to Pārvati (two of them are quoted below 

in note).362 It is very much in vogue among Mahārāstra women. The following is a brief description. The woman should take an oil and myrobalan paste bath and wear fine silken clothes. After referring to the tithi &c. the woman should make sankalpa as noted below.363 She should bow to Umā and Siva; she should offer worship to Umā by means of the 16 upacāras with appropriate mantras such as āvāhana (invoking to be present), āsana (seat), pādya, arghya &c. After offering flowers the per former should carry out worship of the limbs of Umā from the feet in the form 'bow to Umā, I worship her feet' to the head. Then she should offer incense, lamp, naivedya, āca maniya, fragrant substances like camphor and sandalwood for rubbing on the hands, betelnut, tumbāla, dakṣiṇā, ornaments, nirājana (waving of a lamp). She should then offer worship to the several names of Umā (such as Gauri, Pārvati &c.) and the several names of Siva (such as Hara, Mahādeva, Sambhu &c.) and present a handful of flowers, and go round (pradaksiņā) the images of Umā and Maheśvara, make with an appropriate mantra in each

case an obeisance 364 and a prayer and donate presents placed in vessels of wickerwork together with auspicious substances. 

This vrata is not prevalent in Bengal nor in Gujarat. 

It is provided by Madhava that 365 if the third is mixed up with the 2nd tithi and the 4th tithi, the vrata is to be performed on the later day, provided the third tithi exists at least for a muhūrta (two ghatikās) and then 4th tithi follows. 

In modern times women purchase coloured clay images of Pārvati, of Sivalinga and a friend of Pārvati and worship them. 

It is difficult to say why the vrata is called Haritālikā. The Vratarāja366 (p. 108) says it is vratarāja (the prince among yratas) and was so called because Pārvati was taken away (from home) by her friends. 

The Vratarāja contains a story said to have been narrated by Siva himself to Parvati about the vrata by performing which she secured him as her husband and also the position of boing half of Siva's body. The Varāhapurāņa (chap. 22) contains a long narrative about the marriage of Gauri with Siva. 

On the 4th of the bright half of Bhadrapada is observed the festival of Gaņeśacaturthi in many parts of India (though not in Bengal or Gujarat). According to the Samayamayūkha,367 Ganesacaturthi is also called Varadacaturthi. The proper time for the performance is mid-day, as said by Bṛhaspati 368 quoted in the Kālanirnaya. When Caturthi-tithi is mixed up with the

3rd tithi and also with 5th, then, if at midday there is caturthi, the one mixed with the 3rd is to be preferred. If at midday there is no caturthi, but on the next day there is caturthi at 

midday mixed with pancami, then parariddhā (i. e. mixed with the following 5th) is to be preferred.369 Briefly, the procedure is as follows. In modern times a clay image of Ganesa beautifully painted is brought, and prūnapratisthū is effected and worship is offered to Vināyaka with 16 upacāras; two dūrvā tendrils with sandalwood paste are offered with each of ten names 370 quoted below (i. e. in all 20 dūrvā tendrils) and after reciting all the ten names together the remaining one dūrvā (21st) is offered. 21 modakas are got ready and placed before the image ; one is offered as naivedya, ten are donated to brāhmanas, ten are eaten by the performer himself (or his family).371 The P. C. p. 94 and Vratarāja (pp. 144-151) give a more elaborate procedure. If Bhādrapada 4th of bright half falls on a Sunday or Tuesday this caturthi is called great 372 (mahati). The important vedic mantra in the worship of Ganesa is Rg. II. 23. 1 = Tai. S. II. 3. 14. 3 (Gaņānām tvā Ganapatim havāmahe) which is really addressed to Brahmanaspati, but in medieval and modern conceptions Ganesa takes over the characteristics of that Vedic god. The number 21 is important in Ganesacaturthi. 

The form of Gaņeśa to be contemplated upon is described as follows : 373 'one should contemplate on God Siddhi vināyaka who has only one tusk; whose ears are wide like a winnowing basket, who has nūga (snake) worn in the way of yajñopavīta and wields in his hands a snare and goad.' 

In medieval times and also in modern times the popular belief was and is that if one happens to see the moon on Gaṇeśa

caturthi evening one is falsely charged with the commission of a theft or the like. If one sees the moon on that date by mistake, in order to escape the consequence of a false charge, one should repeat the Paurāņika verse addressed by a child's nurse to it A lion killed Prasenajit, the lion was killed by Jāmbavat; don't cry, O Sukumāraka (or tender boy)! this is your Syamantaka jewel':374 The story is referred to in Mausalaparva 3. 23 and is narrated in several Purānas. Vide Vāyu 96. 20-52, Agni 175. 40-44, Matsya chap. 45, Vişnu-purāna IV. 13. 3-18, Bhāgavata X Uttarārdha, Padma V. 13.78–93 and VI. 276. 56,5-37, Brahma 16. 12-45. The Sun is said to have given to Prasena's brother, Satrājit, the highly refulgent Syamantaka jewel that produced eight bhāras of gold every day (Bhāgavata X. 56. 11 ); Krspa hankered after it but could not secure it. Prasena decked with the jewel went hunting and was killed by a lion, the latter in its turn was killed by the bear leader Jambavat, who took the jewel and entered his own lair with it. Satrājit and the Yādavas suspected Krsna as having brought about the death of Prasena for the sake of the jowel. Kļspa, unable to bear the calumny, ultimately traced the corpses of Prasena and of the lion and entered the cave of Jāmbavat on hearing the above verse addressed by the nurse from inside the cave. Krsna fought inside the cave a duel with Jāmbayat and when Krspa did not come out for days the Yādava followers of Krşpa returned to Dvārakā and reported that Krsna was killed. Jāmbavat was defeated after 21 days (28 acc. to Bhāgavata X. 58, 24), made peace with Krsna by giving in marriage his daughter Jāmbavati to Krsna and the Syamantaka jewel as a dowry. Krsna on returning to Dvārakā handed over the jewel to Satrājit, brother of Prasena, and cleared himself of the false charge. Some Purāņas like Vāyu 96.52 and Matsya 375 45. 34 state that who

ever knows this story about the clearance of Krsna from a false charge would not be liable to have a false charge made against him by any one. The Tithitattva 376 provides that if a man inadvertently sees the moon on the night of the 4th in Bhādra (śukla) he should repeat the verse of the nurse quoted above over some water, drink it and should listen to the story of the Syamantaka jewel. 

When Ganesa is worshipped on Bhādra 4th of bright half, that tithi is called, according to Bhavisya, Sivā, when Ganesa is honoured on Māgha-sukla 4 it is called Santā, and when on the 4th of the bright half the weekday is Tuesday that caturthi is called Sukhā. The three 377 are respectively described in Hemādri (vrata) vol. I pp. 512-513, pp. 513-514 and pp. 515-519. 

In modern times the worship of Ganesa lasts for one day and a half, for two days, 5 days, 7 days or till Anantacaturdaši (14th of bright half of Bhādra), according to the usages of the people, their inclinations and their tastes. The image is then immersed in a well, tank or in the sea in a great procession. In certain parts of the Deccan and among common people it is customary to perform Gaurīpūjā on 7th and 8th of Bhādrapada sukla and immerse Gauri (represented by a sheaf of plants) and Gapeśa image on the same day and at the same time on 9th. 

Gapeśa is the most popular god in these days and it is the practice to invoke him at the beginning of every important undertaking or rite. He is the God of wisdom, the presiding deity of literature, the bestower of success and the destroyer of obstacles. 

About the antiquity of Ganesa worship and of images of Gaņoša a good deal has been said in H. of Dh, vol. II. pp. 213-216 and 725. A few matters not mentioned there may be set out bere. The Brahmavaivarta-purāna has a section called Ganesa khanda (in 46 chapters), wherein several legends about Ganesa are dwelt upon The Ganapatyatharvašīrsa 378, imitating the

style of such ancient Upanisads as the Taittiriya, Brhadā ranyaka and Chandogya, identifies Ganapati with the Highest Brahma. The Ahalyākāmadhenu quotes passages from Bhavisyottara-purāna on Ganesacaturthi. in I. A. vol. 35 p. 60 an archaeological and mystic explanation is offered about the mouse being the conveyance of Ganeša and his elephant head, which is fantastic and hardly convincing. Several legends are told about Ganesa, his elephant head, his single tusk. Vide Mukerji p. 9. One of the most fantastic is the one in the Varāha purāņa (chap. 23) where it is said that from the laugh of Siva sprang a very handsome boy whom Pārvati looked at with admiring eyes when Siva's jealousy was roused and he cursed the boy to be elephant-headed and pot-bellied and then be relented and made him the chief of all Vinayakas. 

The Krtykalpataru (on vrata) pp. 84-87 quotes a passage from the Narasimha-purāna 379 (chap. 26. 2-20) about Ganesa caturthi-vrata, which also occurs anong several vratas about Ganesa set out in Hemādri (on vrata vol. I pp. 510-512). It differs considerably from the celebration of Ganesacaturthi described above. A few important points are stated here, Gapesa is described as having one, two or four tusks and as having four arms. It is further stated that Gapeśa causes obstacles (vighna) if not worshipped at the beginning of every undertaking. Gapeśa assumed the form of an elephant for effecting the purposes of gods and thereby frightened all dānaras. 

On the 5th tithi of the bright half of Bhadrapada occurs the Rşipañcami-vrata. It was meant for men of all varnas but is now mostly practised by women. Hemādri (on vrata, vol. I. pp. 568-572) describes the prata at length quoting from the Brahmānda-purāņa. One should, after bathing in a river or the like and after performing his daily duties, repair to his agnihotra shed, should bathe with Pañcāmrta the images of the seven sages and, anointing them with sandalwood paste and camphor, worship them with flowers, fragrant substances, incense, lamp, white clothes and yajñopavītas and sumptuous naivedya and offer

them arghya 380 with the mantra noted below. One should, when engaged in this vrata, subsist on vegetables alone and observe celibacy. The result is freedom from all sins and from troubles of three kinds 381 and the increase of one's good fortune. If a woman performs this vrata she enjoys happiness, becomes endowed with good bodily form, beauty and sons and grandsons. 

Later medieval digests like the Vratārka (folio 90), Vratarāja (pp. 200-206) add details and a story from Bhavisyo ttara narrated to Yudhisthira by Krsna. The sin of Brahmahatyā (brāhmana-murder), of which Indra became guilty by killing Vrtra, son of Tvastr, was distributed in four places viz. in Agni (the first flames mixed with smoke), rivers (turbid in the rains), mountains (on which trees exuding sticky gum grow) and among women (in their monthly illness). Therefore this vrata should be performed particularly by women for getting rid of the sin of contact during their monthly illness. 

The sankalpa is given below.381a Another detail is that the seven sages together with Arundhati are to be worshipped. It is further provided that one should subsist on vegetables 382 or nivāras or śyāmāka grains or bulbous roots or fruits and should not eat anything produced by ploughing the land. Even in these days those who perform this vrata do not eat corn produced by employing oxen. In modern times if men perform the vrata the priest invokes for them seven sages with Vedic mantras viz. Rg. IX. 114. 2 (for Kasyapa), Rg. V. 78. 4 (for Atri), Rg. VI. 25.9

The mantra for Arundhati is quoted below.383 In this vrata the number seven is important. The vrata is to be performed for seven years, there are to be seven jars, seven brāhmaṇas were to be invited to whom finally the images (made of gold or silver) of the seven sages were to be donated. If all the images were placed in one kalaša, then the jar with the images was to be donated to one brāhmaṇa and the others were to be given kalašas with clothes and daksiņā. 

If pañcami is mixed up with the 4th tithi and the 6th tithi, one must perform the Rsipañcami vrata on the 5th mixed with the 4th (pūrvaviddhā) and not on 5th mixed with 6th, in accord ance with the Yugmavākya quoted above (n. 191). Besides, Hārsta expressly 384 prohibits the acceptance of the 5th mixed with the 6th in the words (5th tithi mixed with the 4th should be accepted and not the 5th joined to the 6th, both in the bright and dark halves and in rites for the gods and pitys). But there is the most important rule laid down by Hārīta himself that in all vratas comprising worship the tithi to be selected is the one that covers mid-day 385 Supposing that the 5th tithi does not cover mid-day when joined with 4th, but covers mid-day when joined with 6th, the latter (paraviddhā) would have to be chosen. Hemādri would hold this latter view, while Mādhava holds that everywhere 5th which is pūrvaviddhā is to be accepted. Hence there is diver gence of view among the great writers. 

It appears that originally the Rsipañcami-vrata was meant for the removal of sins for all, but later on it came to be specially provided for women; but it is not observed in Saurāstra. 

On the 14th of the bright half of Bhadrapada is celebrated the Anantacaturdaśī-vrata. It does not appear in the Krtya kalpataru (on vrata). 

It consists chiefly in the worship of Hari as Ananta and in wearing on the the right hand in the case of men and on the left

On the 14th of the bright half one should worship the image of Ananta (Hari) which is made of darbha grass placed in a vessel for water (a jar). He should get ready flour of a prastha of paddy and make cakes from that, half of which should be donated to a brāhmana and the remaining half he should use for himself. One should perform this yrata on the bank of a river and listen to stories about Hari and (pray to Hari) as follows:386 O Vāsudeva! save (people) sunk in the great and endless ocean of saisūra and make them apply themselves to the contemplation of the form of Ananta; salutation to thee that hast numerous forms! Having worshipped (Hari) with this mantra and having tied on one's arm or round one's neck a string of threads over which a mantra has been uttered, the person who performs the Anantavrata becomes happy. If Hari is Ananta, then fourteen knots may be deemed to symbolize the fourteen worlds created by Hari. 

Hemādri (on vrata vol. II, pp. 26–36) has an elaborate description of Anantavrata together with the story of Kaupdinya and his wife Śilā told by Krsna to Yudhisthira. Krspa states that Ananta is one of his forms and identifies himself with Kāla (Time) that is called Ananta. Ananta should be worshipped with the upacaras of sandalwood paste, incense, flowers, naivedya. 

In front of the image of) Ananta should be placed a doraka dyed with saffron and having fourteen knots. The mantra (quoted in note) should be recited and the doraka should be tied on one's arm, one should then dine with an easy mind after contemplating on Nārāyana as Ananta. In the story it is narrated how because the husband Kauņdinya from youthful rashness and pride cut the Ananta thread tied round his wife's hand he lost everything, then repented and was taken into favour by Ananta. The V, K, K. (pp. 324-339) describes at great length the procedure of Anantapūjā together with stories taken

from the Bhavisyottara, and the Tithitattva also (p. 123 ) quotes portions from the Bhavisyottara. The Kālanirnaya (p. 279) expressly states that the Anantayrata is described in the Bhavisyottara and discusses a few verses therefrom. The Vratārka (folio 277a-285a) describes this vrata at great longth. Briefly it is this: first sankalpa, then making a sarvato-thadra mandala and placing a jar thereon, on which is placed a nāga with seven hoods made of darbhas and in front of it a doraka with 14 knots, worshipping the doraka on the jar with 16 upa cāras with the Purusasūkta (Rg. X. 90) and Paurānika mantras; 14 devatās of the knots from Vişnu to Vasus are invoked, then there is worship of the limbs from the feet upwards in such mantras as "Anantāya namah padau pūjayāmi,' then a handful of flowers with the mantras of Visņu, prayer to Ananta, tying the doraka with a mantra, casting away the old doraka after offering it worship. Salt is forbidden in this vrata. It was 387 believed that if this vrata was performed for fourteen years, one reached the world of Vişnu. 

There is a variance in the views of eminent writers about the exact time and the tithi for the vrata whon 14th is mixed with other tithis (13th or Paurpimā). Mādhava 388 holds that mid-day is not the karmakāla in this vrata, but that tithi which exists at sunrise for three muhurtas is the most suitable one for Ananta-vrata. The Nirnayasindhu holds 389 that Madhava was mistaken because he relied for his decision on a general rule that the principal tithi to be accepted is the one that covers mid-day, that the Anantavrata is not mentioned in other purāpas and also in other digests and that the passages of the Bhavisya and Skanda quoted by others are baseless and unauthoritative. 

There are even in these days many persons who engage in the Anantacaturdašī-vrata, but their numbers are rapidly diminishing.

CHAPTER IX 

Navaratra or Durgotsava 

From the 1st of Āśvina bright half to the 9th is celebrated the Durgāpājā festival, otherwise called Navarātra, observed all over India in some form or other. Some of the works 390 provide that Durgotsava must be celebrated in both Sarad (Āśvina-śukla) and Vasanta (in Caitra-śukla). But it is the Durgotsava39 of Āśvina that is celebrated in a grand style, particularly in Bengal, Bihar and Kāmarūpa. 

If a person is unable to celebrate the festival392 for nine days, he should do so for three days beginning from the 7th tithi of Asvina-sukla. In fact, the Tithitattva 393 puts forward several alternative periods for Durgapuja as follows: (1) from the 9th tithi of the preceding dark half of Pūrnimānta Āśvina to the 9th tithi of Asvina-sukla; (2) from the first tithi of Asvina śukla to 9th; (3) from the 6th to the 9th; (4) from the 7th to the 9th; (5) from the Mahastami to the 9th, (6) only on the Mahāstaml; (7) only on the Mahānavami. Most of these alternatives find support in the Kālikā and other Purāņas.

There is a voluminous literature on Durgotsava. Every digest on vratas, tithis and pūjā devotes considerable space to this subject. Moreover, there are special treatises on Durgotsava or Navarātra, such as the Durgotsavaviveka of Sūlapāņi, the Durgapūjā-prayogatattva (published by the Sanskrit Sābity Parishad, 1924) of which the Durgārcanapaddhati of Raghu nandana (published by Jivananda, vol. II) is a part, Durgābhakti tarangipi of Vidyāpati,394 the Navarātra-pradipa of Vināyaka alias Nanda-pandita, the Durgotsavapaddhati by Udayasimha (2nd half of 15th century A. D. ).395 Besides these, the Mārkandeyapurāpa (chapters 78-90 in Venk. Press ed. and 81-93 in Banerji's) contains what is called Devīmāhātmya 3% (or Saptašati or Candi) in which are described the appearance of Devi from the accumulated tejas of Visņu, Sankara, Agni and other gods, her getting different weapons from the several gods such as the trident from Siva, discus from Visnu, Vajra from Indra, her victory over and slaughter of the

great demon Mahisāsura, and of the demons Canda and Munda, Sumbha and Niśumbha. The Kālikāpurāna, the Brhan-nandiko śvara-purāņa397 and the Devipurāna also devote considerable space to Durgā and her pūjā. I have used, though not much, the English work on Durgā-pūjā by Pratapachandra Ghosh published so far back as 1871. My endeavour will be to give as briefly as possible an account of all the salient features of this great reli gious worship and festival from the Sanskrit texts themselves. 

This pūjā is nitya as well as kāmya ;398 it is the first because the Kālikāpurāna (63. 12–13) prescribes that whoever, through laziness, hypocrisy, hatred or stupidity, does not celebrate the great festival of Durgā has all his desires frustrated by the angry Deyi; it is also kāmya because rewards are promised when one celebrates Durgotsava 'all should always perform the worship of Davi in order to secure incomparable eminence which confers the purusārthas, viz. Dharma, Artha, Kāma and Moksa' and 'one should worship Bhavāni for pleasing her, for happiness in that year, for the destruction of evil spirits and goblins and for delight' (Tithitattva p. 65). The original purposes and objects of this festival were high and noble as stated in the Devi purāna 399 "This is a great and holy vrata conferring great siddhis, vanquishing all enemies, conferring benefits on all people, especially in great floods; this should be performed by brāhmapas for solemn sacrifices and by ksatriyas for the protection of the people, by vaiśyas for cattle wealth, by śūdras desirous of sons and happiness, by women for blessed wifehood and by rich men who hanker for more wealth; this was performed by Sankara and others". But in course of time, the objects were brought down to the ordinary level as stated in the Devimāhātmya 400 'by listening

with devotion to my greatness in the great annual pūjā per formed in autumn, a man becomes free from all troubles and becomes endowed with wealth and agricultural produce by my favour'. The exaggerated importance of this Durgā-pūjā will be clear from one verse of the Bhavisya 'rites like Agnihotra, solemn sacrifices described in the Vedas and completed with daksiņā are not equal oven to one hundred-thousandth part of the worship of Candika.'401 

This Durgāpājā is very cosmopolitan in character. It could be performed not only by persons belonging to the four varņas, but even by those who were outside the pale of the caste system, Durgā-pājā has a congregational character and is not purely religious, but has also a social element in it (such as inviting friends and treating them &c.). The Bhavisyapurana 402 says 'Devi should be worshipped (in her shrine) on Vindhya 

mountain, in all places, cities, houses, villages and forests by brāhmaṇas, ksatriyas, kings, vaisyas, sūdras, who are full of devotion, who have taken a bath and who are cheerful and jolly, by mlecchas and other men (such as pratilomas) and by women'. In another place the Bhavisya states 403 Durgā is worshipped by various groups of mlecchas, by all dasyus (thievish tribes or outcaste Hindus), by people from Anga, Vanga and Kalinga, by kinnaras, Barbaras (non-Aryans) and Sakas'. Later medieval writers were careful to point out that mlecchas bad no adhikūra to perform japa or homa or pūjā with mantras through a brāhmaṇa as sūdras had, but they could only mentally resolve to offer in honour of Devi animals as offerings and wine 104 also and do so.

(Sec. I, Ch. IX 

It is stated in the Skanda and Bhavisya 405 purānas that the worship of Candikā in autumn (Aśvina) is of a threefold character; viz. sāttviki, rājasi and tāması; the sāttviki worship is effected by japa, by offering naivedya in which there is no meat; and japa consists in reciting the texts of the purānas in which the greatness of Devi is described; rājass worship is effected by offering a bali and with naivedya which contains flesh; that is tāmasi worship which is effected by the offerings of wine and meat and from which japa is absent and which is without mantras; this last is approved among Kiratas (i. e. forest tribes and the like). Raghunandana adds 406 in his Prāyascitta tattva that the offering of wine in Durgāpūjā relates to ages other than the Kali age (i. e. other than the present age). 

It has been stated above (pp.110-111, n. 280) that the principal gods are deemed to go to sleep for four months on different tithis from the prati pad (1st) of Āsādha-sukla to the 15th. Therein Durgā is said to go to sleep on the 8th of the bright half of Āsādha. Therefore, in Āśvina she would be asleep. Hence the texts provide for the rousing (bodhana) of Devi from sleep. As usual there are conflicting views. The Tithitattva 407 notices the views of some that if the Devi is to be worshipped as having 18 arms she was to be roused on the 9th of the dark half preceding Aśvina bright half, but that if she was to be worshipped as possessing ten arms then the bodhana was to be on the 6th (of the bright half of Aśvina). Raghunandana does not accept this and holds that the bodhana of Dovī with ton arms was to be either on the 9th (of the preceding dark half) or on the 6th (of the bright half of Asvina). If the performer begins on the 9th of the dark half the sankalpa will be as noted below.408 He may, however, begin on the first

Then he should establish a ghata* (a jar with a peculiar shape, the central portion bulging out, the neck narrow and the brim being broad and open), fill it with water, place twigs of mango and other sacred trees there on and worship Durgā with the 16 or 5 upacāras. Then he should offer materials such as sandal-wood paste, myrobalan for purify ing the hair and also a comb.411 On the 2nd tithi he should offer a silken ribbon for keeping the hair in position, on the third alaktaka (red lac) dye for reddening the feet, vermilion for putting it on the head, a mirror for observing the face; on the 4th tithi he should offer madhuparka (to the goddess), a silver piece having the shape of a tilaka (for the forehead) and col lyrium as decoration for the eyes; on the 5th tithi he should offer sandalwood paste, unguents and ornaments according to his means.

VII. 16. 11, establish a ghata, should worship the bilra tree as Durgā. If he has already started the utsava on pratipad, then he should go near a bilva tree in the evening conjoint with Jyesthā or without it (and even if şasthi has expired before evening, then in the evening without sasthi) and rouse Devī with the mantra 413 ‘for the destruction of Rāvana and in order to favour Rāma, Brahmā, O goddess, in former times roused you at an unusual time; therefore, I also awaken you in the evening of the 6th tithi of Ašvina.' After thus awakening Devi he should invite the bilva treo with the words "O bilva tree! born on the top of Srisaila and the abode of Lakşmi, I have to take you; come, you are to be worshipped as Durgā.' Then he should, after taking each of the substances mentioned below and accompanying each with a mantra, place them on the bilva tree and make it an auspicious dwelling place for Durgā. The substances for making a holy 414 residence for Devi are; earth or clay, sandalwood paste, pebbles, coriander, dūryā grass, flowers, fruits, curds, ghee, svastika, vermilion, conch-shell, collyrium, rocana. (yellow pigment), mustard seeds,

Then he should repair to the pandal erected for Durgā. pājā, perform ācamana, should bind together with Aparājita creeper twigs or leaves of nine plants 415 so as to form one bundle or sheaf, viz. plantain, pomegranate, coriander, turmeric, Arum Indicum, Arum colocacia, bilva, aśoka and jayanti. Each of these substances is accompanied by an appropriate separate mantra. 

He should offer worship to the bundle of nine plants and to the image (of Durgā) and make the Devi abide in the bilva tree with sandalwood (and other substances mentioned above). The rousing (bodhana) of the Devi and the invitation to the bilva tree are separate and are done with separate mantras (Tithitattva pp. 75-76). The two may be done at the same time if 6th tithi exists in the evening; but if it does not exist in the evening then bodhana may be done on the 6th and invitation on the 7th or bodhana may be done in the morning and invita tion in the evening. The clay image of Durgā together with the twig of bilva is to be entered in the house and worshipped. The details of the complicated discussion are not set out here. 

• Then follow acts to be done on the 7th tithi, On the 7th tithi conjoint with mūla-naksatra or without it the performer after taking a bath approaches a bilva tree, worships it, folds his hands and says 'o blessed bilva tree! you are always dear to Sankara; after taking from you a branch I shall perform Durgā worship; O Lord! you should not feel pain due to the cutting of a branch; O bilva! prince among trees, salutation to you!' After saying this he should cut off from the bilva tree a branch other than one in the south-west or north-west and endowed with a couple of fruits (or without fruit) with the mantra noted below.416 Then he should take the branch, come to the place of worship (the maņdapa or the like ) and place it on a pitha (a seat).

He then establishes the bundle of (the leaves and twigs) of nine plants tied together with Aparājitā creeper and the bilva branch. He worships the latter with 'salutation to the bilva branch' and honours Cāmundā on the bilva branch and the clay image with the words 'this is pādya (water for washing the feet), salutation to Cāmupdā' and addresses the bilva branch with the mantra quoted in n. 413 above. Then he utters the mantra 'O Cāmundā'l move, move, make others move, enter my house quickly and go to the place of worship, svāhā'. Then he establishes the ghata, worships the nine plants and five devatās, establishes the image on a seat and the bundle of nine plants to its right to the accompaniment of songs and instrumental music and places the bilva branch in a copper vessel near the (image of) Devi and performs the prana pratisthā 417 (vivifying or endowing with life) of the image of the Devi and of Ganeša and other deities in the manner provided in the Durgārcanapaddhati (p. 666) and Tithitattva (pp. 77-78). Then he should, after taking in his hand husked rice-grains and flowers, contemplate upon the form of Devi.

Then the performer should put a flower on his head, take flowers and rice grains in his hand and make an invocation (āvāhana) with two mantras to Durgā to be present in the bilya branch and establish her with the prayer to bestow long life, health and prosperity. He offers to the Devi the several upacāras of asana, pādya, arghya &c.

Then he should worship Durgā with pādya and other upacāras 420 and offer a kid or the like as an offering. The kid or he-buffalo should be dark and should be at least five years old.421 

Much has been written about the sacrifice of animals in Durgāpūjā. Only a few points can be dealt with here. The Kālikā-purāņa enumerates the following animals as fit for sacri fice in honour of Durgā and Bhairava 422 "birds, tortoises, croco diles, fish, deer of nine kinds, buffalo, gavaya (Gayal), bull, goat, mongoose, boar, rhinoceros, black antelope, śarabha (a fabulous animal), lion, tiger, a human being and blood from one's own (i. e. the performer's) body; but the females of the species specified above were not to be offered as bali and the person whe did so would go to hell. This was probably a con cession to placate Devi who might have a soft corner for a bali

of her own sex, The bali should have no defect and should not be one whose tail or ears were cut off. Though the above list of victims that may be offered is long, usually only goats and he-buffaloes were sacrificed. It is said 423 'the Devi that resides on Vindhya is not so well pleased with the offerings of flowers, incense, and unguents and of other animals as she is pleased with offerings of rams and he-buffaloes'. The Varsa-kriya kaumudi 424 quotes "one should never offer to the great Devi a horse or elephant; if a brāhmaṇa offers a lion, a tiger or a human being (as balı) he would go to hell and even in this world he would have a short life and would be devoid of happiness and prosperity; if (a brahmana) offers his own blood, he would be guilty of suicide. If a brāhmaṇa offered wine he would lose his status as a brāhmaṇa. When wine is laid down as a necessary offering he should offer cocoanut water in a vessel of bell-metal or honey in a copper vessel." But there were texts that contradict this. For example, it is said in the Kalikapurana goat, he-buffalo, human being are declared to be bali, mahābali and atibali, respectively.' 425 It has to be remembered that though an animal is killed still what is offered to the Devi is generally blood and the head of the victim. The Kālikāpurāņa 426 says 'blood purified by the recitation of mantras over it and the head (of a victim) are said to be nectar; in the worship (of Devi) the adept worshipper

should offer flesh rarely (if at all) except blood and the head, which (two) become nectar." The Kālikāpurāna further states that Siva (Durgā) partakes of the head as well as the flesh of the victim, that one should offer in pūjā the blood and head of the victim, but the wise ( devotee ) should employ flesh in edibles and in homa. The Durgārcanapaddhati (pp. 669-671) prescribes an elaborate ritual about killing the bali and offering its blood and head and the rites and mantras slightly differ according as the bali is a goat, a buffalo or the performer's own blood. The 427 bali is made to face the east, the sādhaka (devotee) faces the north and repeats certain mantras one of which is Vāj. S. 23. 17 'Agni was the animal to be sacrificed. They sacrificed with him, he conquered this world (the earth) on which Agni exists; that will be your world, you will conquer that world, drink this water. Vāyu (wind God) was the animal &c.; the Sun was the animal &c.' Another mantra is Manu V.39 (=Vişnu dharmasūtra 51. 61-Kālikā 71.39) viz. 'animals were created by Brahmā himself for serving the purpose of sacrifice, for the well-being of sacrifice and of all; therefore killing (an animal) in a sacrifice is no killing (does not cause the sin or blame of ordinary killing )'. He should place on the head of the bali a flower with a mantra; tion he sprinkles water with kuśas over the bali and then worships the sword with the mantra "you are the tongue of Candikā and you accomplish heaven (for the worshipper); Hrīm, Srim, O sword l'. The performer contemplates on the sword as described in Tithitattva (p. 81) and Durgārcana paddhati (p. 670), honours it with sandalwood paste and the rest and repeats eight names of the gword, bows to it, takes it up with the words * Ām, Hrīm, Phat' and with one stroke cuts off the victim facing the east ( while the performer faces the north ) or facing the north (while the performer faces the east). Then he collects blood in a vessel of clay or other material, places it before the Devi and offers it with the words 'this is the blood of the goat; Om, O Jayanti!' and says 'Aim, Hrim, Srim, O Kausiki! May she be pleased by the blood.' Then he offers the head of the bali (goat or the like) placing on the head a lamp with a flaming wick. He then takes blood from the sword (with

which the animal's neck was cut) and makes a tilaka mark with it on his forehead with two mantras. It was supposed that the tilaka of blood would make all persons amenable to the person who had that blood mark on the forehead as the mantra quoted below expresses. When the bali is a buffalo, the mantras repeated over a goat are omitted and two others are substituted viz. 'as you hate a horse and as you carry Candikā, so kill my enemies and bring happiness, O buffalo; you are the vehicle of Yama, you possess excellent form, you who are deathless; bestow on me long life, wealth, fame, a bow to you who are a buffalo'. The fruit of offering buffalo's blood to Devi was deemed to be her gratification and favour for a hundred years. Then he performs japa of a mantra (quoted in note )428 and also certain verses of laudation and asks for certain benefits (Durgārcana. p. 672).929 

The Kālikāpurāna in a long passage 430 provides gradually rising periods of times for which Durgā becomes gratified by the offering of the blood of various animals. A few might be cited here: Durgā secures satisfaction for one month by the (offering of the) blood of fishes and tortoises, and for two months by (the blood of) crocodiles; by the blood of the black antelope and of the boar Devi is pleased for twelve years and by the blood of buffalo and rhinoceros for a hundred years; by the blood of the lion, the śarabha and from the performer's body Devi is gratified for a thousand years and hy a human being as a bali for a thousand years." There was a revulsion cf fealing against blood sacrifices in some hearts and so even the Kālikā provides 431 that the offerings of kūşmāņda (pumpkin-gourd) and sugarcane stalks, intoxicants and āsavas (spirits distilled from molasses, flowers or herbs) are like (animal) victims and gratification

(to the Devi) is the same as by the offering of a goat. But even in these days castes deemed higher, even including brāhmaṇas, offer goats and rarely buffaloes to Durgā, if that is the custom of the caste or family. I understand that many families of learned brāhmaṇas such as the Bhattācāryas of Bhatpara in West Bengal sacrifice fruits and vegetables in lieu of animals. The Ahalyākāma-dhenu 432 says that some Vaisnavas regard the night when victims are killed as horrible and do not eat food or even drink water on that night and that among brāhmana castes the offering (bali) should be in the form of kūsmānda and the like or flour images of animals or simple ghee should be offered. As to other castes also it has been declared that Kūşmānda, bilva fruit, sugarcane stalks may be cut into pieces. 

The convenient belief from very ancient times has been that a victim offered in sacrifice to gods and pitrs went to heaven. Rg. I. 162.21433 = Vāj. S. 23. 16 ) and Manu V. 42 say 80. Hemādri quotes verses saying that all the animals such as the buffalo that are employed for (gratifying) Devi go to heaven and those that kill them incur no sin.134 

The foregoing is somewhat of a digression, as the bali is generally to be sacrificed on the 9th and as the rites of even of the 8th have not yet been described. On the Mahāstami con joined to Pūrvāsādhā-naksatra or without it, the devotee after taking a bath and sipping water, should face the east or north, sit on a seat of darbhas, perform purification of himself and the body which is made up of five elements by repeating separately the mystic letters 'yam, ram, lam, vam' in the manner set out on p. 673 of Durgārcanapaddhati; then he performs prānāyāma, and then nyūsa on the several parts of the body from the heart and head to the feet. He sprinkles over himself and the materials of worship water contained in a vessel of conch-shell

and the like and over which he mutters eight times the mantra 'Hrim, Om Durgāyai namah', he contemplates on Durgā as described on p. 163 and note 418 above, places a flower on his head, mentally offers upacāras (to Devi), again contemplates on Devi's form and then offers the upacaras from āsana (seat) to praņāma (as indicated in note 420 above) with appropriate brief mantras. Then he offers worship to several goddesses to the right side, front side and left side of Devi with brief mantras and to the Mātrs435 (64 are enumerated in Durgārcanao. pp. 676 677, or 32, or 16 or 8) according to one's ability with five upacāras or with sandalwood paste and flowers and to the eight mātrs Brahmāni &c. Then there is angapūjā (worship of Devi's limbs) from heart and head to the feet. Then worship is offered to her weapons such as trident, sword, discus, sharp arrow, shield, fully strung bow, the noose, goad, bell; and then her lion-seat is honoured and also armour, whisk, umbrella, flag and flag-staff, drum, conch. Separate mantras are recited in connection with the pūjā of each of these, as laid down in Durgārcanapaddhati pp. 678-681, in the Nirnayasindhu pp. 179-181 (which quotes them from Vişnudharmottara) and other works. They are all passed over here for saving space. Then he goes near the sheaf of nine plants and worships it with five upacāras or with sandal wood paste and flowers offered to each separately. Then he makes an offering of mūşa pulse and boiled rice. 

On the day on which there is Mahāstamipūjā the performer observes a fast. But a householder 436 who has a son should not observe a fast on the Maltāstami. He should follow one of the alternatives specified above in note 252 (naktam havisyānnam &c). Whatever procedure about food he may follow, he, keeping himself pure and observing the rules of conduct for vrata, should worship Devi; he should offer worship on the Mahāştami and on the 9th with balıs; he should take leave (of Devi) on the 10th with

Śravana-nakşatra after performing the Sābara festival. When the last quarter of Sravana (naksatra) is running then he should give a send-off to Devi on the 10th tithi. The Tithitattva 437 positively asserts that a fast is to be observed on the same day on which Mahāstami-pājā is performed. 

On this 8th tithi the performer has to honour maidens, food them and brāhmaṇas also. He may honour a maiden or maidens from the first to the 9th tithi, but he must do so at least on 8th. The Devipurāņa 438 says "Durgā is not so much gratified by homa, gifts and japa as she is gratified (becomes favourable) by honouring maidens." And he has to give them dakşiņā also. Hemādri (on vrata vol. I. 903-906) quotes a long passage from the Skanda-purāņa on this subject. Skanda provides that the performer should feed maidens from the first tithi of Navarātra on a rising scale, viz. one maiden on the first tithi, two on the 2nd and so on up to nine on the 9th. If he feeds nine virgins every day (of the Navarātra) he secures land; if he feeds double the number on each succeeding day he gets prosperity. He should not honour a maiden who is one year old (or less), for, such a girl has not developed at that age liking for fruits, flowers and sandal wood paste. Therefore, he should honour maidens who are from two to ten years old, and not those that are beyond ten years. The Devipurāņa provides that if no virgin is available, one may honour even a married girl who has had no menstruation.439 The Skanda provides that maidens from two years to ton should be honoured under the following names respectively, viz. Kumārika (two years old), Trimūrti (three years old), Kalyāņi, Rohips, Kāli, Candikā, Sambhavi, Durgā, Subhadra. The Skanda provides special pūjā mantras for each of the nine kinds of maidens and different rewards are provided for honouring each of the nine classes. These are passed over here. The general āvāhanamantra for all in the morning after the performer has

taken a ceremonial bath with oil is noted below.440 In this way he is to honour virgins with bodice, clothes, sandalwood paste, flowers and akşatas, with different kinds of edibles and dishon and feed them with pūyasa (rice boiled in milk and sugar). One should not honour a maiden that has a limb more or less, that suffers from leprosy, or that has varicose veins or has a broken head or has limbs from which blood or pus oozes or has ulcers, that is blind from birth, is squint-eyed or blind of one eye or is ugly or has little hair or much hair or is diseased or is born of a slave woman. A man should honour a brāhmaṇa maiden in all acts, a ksatriya maiden for victory, one belonging to untouch able castes in acts of terrible nature. After the maidens are fed, brāhmaṇas also should be fed (Durgārcana. pp. 681), 

The Tithitattva (pp. 69-72), Nirnayasindhu and other works provide that in the Navaratra the performer should hear the recitation of the Vedas (Vedapārāyaṇa) and that beginning with the first tithi up to the 9th he should himself mutter Cardipātha (recitation of Devimāhātmya) or engage a person to do so, reciting it once on the first, twice on 2nd tithi and so on up to nine times on 9th tithi. The Devipurāņa provides for pūjā, japa and homa and the mantras therefore by saying that the worship of Devi is to be performed by casting into the fire sesame and with curds, milk and ghee. The Dovi mantra is either what is called the Jayantimantra441 (quoted in note ) or the mantra of nine syllables ( quoted in the note). The Dvaitanirnaya-siddhāntasangraha states that the mantra ia either one that a man's guru has taught him, or the Vedic verse 'Jātayedase sunavāma'(Rg. I. 99.1) or one with nine letters or the one 'namo dovyai mahādevyai' or the slokas in the Saptaśatī.442 The Tithitattva quotes (pp. 69–71) a long passage

from the Vārāhi-tantra about the result of reciting Devimāhātmya several times. A few verses are cited for sample. “When some great danger threatens, one should recite (Devimāhātmya) seven times; if repeated twelve times one secures fulfilment of one's desires and the destruction of enmity; if repeated 14 times, an enemy would be subdued and a woman would be brought under one's control; repeating a hundred times results in increase of one's kingdom; if repeated a thousand times Lakşmi comes to a man of her own accord. As Aśvamedha is the prince among sacrifices, as Hari (is superior) among gods, so the laud called Saptaśati is the highest among all lauds.443" The Tithitattva further provides that one should recite444 before the reading of the 'prathamacarita' the rşi (sage), the metre &c. of it and also when repeating the Madhyamacarita and the Utlaracarita. Very great importance was attached in ancient and medieval times to the recitation of mantras and even modern men brought up in English'schools, colleges and Universities often implicitly believe in their efficacy, even if one may not understand their meaning. The qualities of the sounds of mantras or of parts of mantrag ( such as ‘hrim') and their potentialities, the various devices employed when using them are deemed of far greater importance than the meaning. The Gītā (X. 25) itself puts Japa-yajña as the highest among yajñas such as those of dravya (materials or money), tapoyajña (Gītā IV. 28). Mantras are supposed to have B tremendous effect on the sub-conscious mind and it may perhaps bo so if one concentrates one's mind thereon to the exclusion of all else. A person could himself recite the Saptaśatī or engage a porson to read it to him who was called yāthaka or tācaka as in T. T. p. 72, Durgārcana. p. 661. Some very orthodox writers went 30 far as to lay down that a sūdra could only listen to the Mahābharata or Saptasati but could not read it himself. Raghu Dandana 445 like Kamalakara appears to have held this view. One

should stop reading at the end of a chapter and not in its middle; but if for some reason one had to stop in the middle of a chapter, when one again commenced reading or reciting Saptašati, one should not proceed from where one left off in the middle of a chapter, but begin with the first verse of the chapter half read or recited. Provision was made that the reader engaged for reading Saptaśati should be handsomely requited for his labour hy gifts of gold, silver, cows with bell-metal pails for milking. Mr Ghosh notes (p. 39) that besides the reader of Devimāhātmya a separate priest is selected to repeat the mūlamantra a hundred thousand times and is called Jāpaka. The Nirnayasindhu (pp. 185–186) gives elaborate descriptions of Satacandi-patha and Sahasracandi. In the first, ten well-conducted brāhmaṇas including the ūcārya are chosen. They are to recite together Saptašati once on the 1st day, twice on the 2nd, thrice on the 3rd and four times on the 4th; in this way Saptašati would be repeated one hundred times. In Sahasracaņdi one hundred brāhmaṇas are to be chosen and they are to repeat Saptaśati for four days as in Satacandi-pātha. A thousand brāhmaṇas are to be fed and one hundred cows are to be donated. The Nirnayasindhu notes that these two are not included in the great digests but there is popular usage to this effect. 

After each pūjā prescribed for the day, the family memberg, their friends and guests sit together and partake of the prasāda (which in the houses of the well-to-do comprises select delicacies). 

Formerly, the persons sitting together would have sometimes - numbered hundreds, but in the days of rationing and control, this would not happen. Mukerji (p. 124) notes that guests made offerings to the goddess (usually cash which belongs to the owner and not to the priest.) 

After the pūjā, homa is performed as indicated above; offerings are to be made in fire called 'Balada '446 with the word 

svāhā' at the end to the accompaniment of a mantra preceded by 'om'. The Durgārcana-paddhati notes (p. 681 ) that after the special rites on the Mahāstami described above (viz. pūjā, honouring maidens, homa &c.) are finished the rest of the tithi should be spent by the devotee in dance, song3447 and musio

(jāgara ). It appears that in the Devi and Kālikā purānas it is provided that even on the 8th at midnight an animal such as a goat or he-buffalo should be sacrificed and that on the 9th tithi many balis were to be sacrificed. When the Sun is in the sign of Kanya (Virgin or Virgo) and in the month of Isa (Āśvina ) one should offer pūjā on the 9th tithi of the bright half; one should observe a fast (on that tithi) and at midnight should begin pūjā of Devi with great expenditure and parapher nalia when the naksatra is Mūla or Purvāsādhā; an animal should be killed and a he-buffalo and a goat should be sacrificed'.448 

A short period of time, viz. the last ghatikā 449 of Mahāstami and the first ghatika of navami, was called 'sandhi'. During that period of two ghatikās a pūjā of Devi together with Yoginis is to be performed which is deemed to be the holiest pūjā (Ghosh p. 120). This puja is to be performed like the puja on Mahāstami, but the bali is to be offered at and after the Maha navami begins 450 and not during the last ghatikā of Mahāstami. 

Now the rites of the Mahānavami have to be described. On the 9th tithi conjoined to Uttarāsādhā nakşatra or without it, pājā is to be performed on the lines of the one of Mahastami. This day's puja is 451 only a repetition of that on the 8th, the

only difference being that a larger number of balis (goats etc.) may be sacrificed on it than on the 8th tithi. A bali is to be offered as it is obligatory to do so on the 9th.52 Then the wor shipper should perform homa, if able to do so. If he be unable to perform homa on both days, he should perform it on Mahāstami. The offerings in the fire are to be 108. If a person cannot perform a homa in person he should choose a brāhmaṇa to do it, while a šūdra must always get the homa performed through a brahmana. Lamps should be waved before the Devi (nirajana)52a from her head down to her feet. Dakşiņā (fee) to the priest for the whole of the autumnal pūjā is to be given on the 9th tithi and Raghunandana expressly 453 says that the Durgā-bhakti tarangini is wrong in saying that daksiņā is to be paid after taking leave (visarjana) of Devl. The sankalpa at the time of 

giving daksina is given in the note.45A_If no daksina be paid, the whole rite becomes fruitless. Then he should pray that all defects in the pūjā may be remedied, that whatever he has offered with a devout heart, whether leaves or flowers, fruits or water, whatever naivedya he has offered, may be graciously accepted by Devi and that if any mistake has occurred by his missing some letter or mantra Devī should forgive all that.' He should wash the feet of a brāhmaṇa maiden and give her sum ptuous dinner and ask her to place with her hand on his head aksatas and devoutly follow her a few steps. He should feed brahmanas. It is the practice in many families to embrace each other and sing the praise of Durgā while drums are beaten. Then in a large procession they visit the houses of such relatives and neighbours as have performed the pūjā. Then the united

procession visits other houses and the parties return the visits to each other by turns and wish happiness and good luck to each other and offer sweets. Rājanītiprakāśa (pp. 439–444) quotes a long passage from the Devi-purāņa about the worship of Devi on 9th of Asv. śu. 

On the 10th tithi after bathing and sipping water he should offer worship with sixteen upacaras or with as many as possible, should praise Devi with these words 'Om Durgām Śivām' &c. (on p. 672 of Durgārcanapaddhati), should prostrate himself before her and make request to Devi with the mantra 'Mahişaghni mahāmāye &o.' (ibid. p. 672) and with the verse quoted 454 a below take a flower and cast it on the image with the words 'forgive'. Then after repeating two verses he should raise the image (of Devi), the bilva twig and the sheaf of nine plants from their places and keep them in another place and wave lamps made of 454 6 flour before them. He should go near the water of a river with dance, song, music, Vedic recitations and auspicious sports and pastimes and immerse the image in a tank or in a river after the prayer 454c 'O Durgā, mother of the world, go to your place in order to come back after the lapse of a year.' Then he should perform the sābarotsava. This last means that actions usually associated with the sabaras (i. e. aboriginal tribes like the Bhils &c.) should be indulged in (to express ecstacy of the Durgāpūjā) on the 10th tithi after the immersion

of the image of Devi.455 The Kālaviveka quotes Satya to the effect that leave is taken of Devi on the last pāda of Sravana naksatra in the day and śābarotsava is celebrated on the 10th, and explains that what is meant is that like men of the Sabara tribe, people wear leaves of trees, their bodies are besmeared with mire, they make incoherent prancing movements and are engaged in dances, songs and music. The Kālikāpurāņa dwells on this at great length. It says: " the visarjana ( sending away) of Devī should be made with festivals in the manner of sabaras, viz. people may make merry to their heart's content by throwing dust and mud, with auspicious sports and revelry, with indulg ence in words and songs referring to male and female organs and with words expressive of the sexual act. The Devi becomes angry with him who does not abuse another and whom others do not abuse and pronounces on him a terrible curse." This pro vision that every one, how highsoever, was to join in the sabarotsava was probably made for emphasizing that before the Devi the highest and the lowest were of equal status and every one must join in the frolics on the 10th tithi to show that all men were equal at least one day in the year. After the immer sion friends visit friends and partake of sweets. It appears that this last practice is now not in vogue. 

A few words must be said with reference to certain relevant matters. How Devi was to be contemplated upon can be seen from 

p. 163, note 418 above. That shows that only the image of Devi with the lion and the demon Mahişāsura was to be constructed. In the Mārk. purana 56 it is stated that Devī strode over the great demon's throat, struck him with her trident and with her heavy sword cut off his head and made him fall down on the ground. But in modern times the image of Devi is placed in a structure of wickerwork and there are images of Lakşmi and Gaņośa on

the right side and of Sarasvati and Kartikeya on the left457. Raghunandana does not make much of these additional deities, though he speaks of the prānapratisthā of Ganesa and others. On p. 146 of 'Cave temples of India' by Fergusson and Burgess reference is made to a tableau at Mahavalli-puram of the strife between Mahisā sura and Devi ( with eight arms), which the learned authors assign to the period 650-700 A. D. The image may be made of gold or silver, clay, metal, stone or there may only be a picture of Devī. For Durgāpūjā it is not absolutely necessary that there should be an image. Davi may be wor shipped458 in a linga, on an altar or in a book, in her pādukās ( wooden or stone feet), in imo ce, in a picture or a trident or sword or in water. Some of the purāņas like Garuda and Bhavisya459 state that on the '/th or 8th tithi nine wooden houses or only one with four corners may be constructed, that in the midst of it a platform or altar of four cubits in length and breadth should be made on which a throne of silk, woollen cloth and deer-skin should be prepared, whereon Durgā ( image ) made of gold, silver, clay or wood was to be established having four or ten arms, possessing a complexion like heated gold, three eyes and the moon as a head ornament. 

There is no unanimity about the arms of Devi, The Varāha purana (95.41) speaks of 20 arms of Devi and mentions the twenty weapons she carries (95.42-43). In the Devibhagavata V.8.44 she is said to have 18 arms. Hemadri (on vrata, vol. I. pp. 923-924) quotes verses in which Devi is said to have eight arms and ten arms respectively.

both ten arms and eight arms. It appears that different numbers of arms were associated with different forms and names of Devi, For example, Vidyāpati in describing the form of Kāli or Cāmunda speaks of her as having four arms. In the Virāțaparva (chap. 6) where Yudhisthira praises Durga, she is described (in verse 8) as having four arms. 

There are varying views about the word 'navarātra'. Some hold that navaratra means 'nine days and nights'; it signifies only the time for a vrata (i. e. it is a gunavidhi), not the name of a rite (karma), while others contend that navarātra is the name of a rite or vrata, which may last for eight days ( if there is tithiksaya) or ten days (if there is viddhi of a tithi from the first tithi to the 9th). The first view is held by works like the Kalatattvavivecana (pp. 270-272), while the 2nd is held by the Nirnayasindhu461 (p. 165), the Purusārthacintamapi (p. 61) and others. As the discussion is scholastic and hardly of any practical importance it is passed over bere. 

The principal matters in Navarātra or Durgapūja, though it may be spread over three days ( from 7th tithi) or nine days (from 1st to 9th), are four as laid down by the Lingapurana viz. snapana 462 (bathing the image), puja, the offering of a victim (bali) and homa. For want of space gnāpana has not been dwelt upon in the above. The Durgārcanapaddhati (p. 674). the Vrataraja (p. 340) and other digests state at length how the image of Durgā may be bathed with scented water, with milk, curds, ghee, pancagavya of a kapilā cow, sugarcane juice and what rewards are reaped by particular kinds of baths. One example is given here for a sample.463 The man who even for

a day bathes Candikā with pañcagavya to the accompaniment of Candigāyatri goes near Vişnu. If the image is made of some material (like clay) that cannot bear a water bath, the bright sword placed near Devi's image may be bathed or a mirror, as stated by the Kālikāpurāņa. The other three out of the four principal items in Durgāpūjā have been dealt with above. Out of the four, pūjā is the most important and a fast is only an anga (ancillary matter). 

Then the question arises as to when pūjā is to be performed. Here there are varying views. The Samaya-mayūkha 464 (p. 14) quoting Devi-purāņa appears to hold that the pūjā should be in the morning, while the Nirnayasindhu (p. 165) holds that it should be at night. It appears from the Devi-purāņa and Kālikā purāņa that pūjā in the morning, mid-day and at night is intended 465 When the sun is in sign Virgo, the devotee should follow the method of ayācita or nakta or take food only once or subsist only on water beginning from the nandikā tithi of the bright half, should bathe in the morning, should rise superior to the opposites (of heat and cold, happiness and pain &c.) and should worship (Siva and) Sivā three times a day.' The Kāla tattvavivecana 466 resolves this conflict by saying that morning and midday pūjās are brief, the principal and elaborate pājā is at night only. There is some confusion caused by the texts laying down the nakşatras, tithis or both on which the different items in the Durgāpūjā were to be performed. The Kālaviveka quotes Vyāsa as follows: 'one should awaken Devī on Ārdrā nakşatra, make her enter (the devotee's house) on Mūla, and

having worshipped her on Uttarāsādbā should take leave of her on Śravana'. 467 Most digests refer only to the tithis. For example, we saw above (p. 159 note 411) that on the 7th tithi the bilva branch is to be brought to the house, on the 8th fast, pūjā and jāgara are to be observed, the bali is offered on 9th, and on the 10th nirājana and discharging the Devi take place. Some texts combine the tithi and naksatra for the several parts of Durgāpūjā. For example, the Rājamārtanda verse (q. in n. 426 above) says 'one should, after propitiating with faith (Devi) by the head, flesh and blood of several kinds of animals, take leave of her on Sravana-naksatra and 10th tithi'. The Devipurāņa provides 468 The bilva tree should be addressed with a mantra on 6th tithi joined to Jyesthā, (the sheaf of), plants should be brought into the house on the 7th joined to Mūla, fast, pūjā and homa take place on the 8th joined to Pūrvāsādhā, on the 9th joined to Uttarāsādhā one should worship Durgā with animal sacrifices and after prostrating oneself before her leave should be taken of her on 10th tithi joined to Sravana'. It often happened that the tithi and naksatra provided for an item did not tally and some rules were evolved. The first rule is: if both tithi and naksatra as provided tallied then that led to very good results, as said in the Lingapurāna 'even if there be no Mūla nakşatra, one should enter the bilva branch in the house on the seventh; the same rule applies to other tithis, but if the naksatras exist on the tithis specified there is increase of the results or

rewards.' The second rule was that tithi was superior 169 and therefore even if the naksatra did not exist on the tithi specified, one should follow the tithi laid down for the several items in Durgāpūjā. Devala and Lalla 70 laid this down, 

One question on which there is difference of view is about the tithi on which Navarātra is to be begun when pratipad is mixed with amāvāsyā or dyitiy. There are very lengthy discussions in the Nirnayasindhu, Kālatattvavivecana, Puruşārtha-cintāmaņi and other works. Some quote passages from the Devi and other purānas condemning the beginning of navarātra on pratipad mixed with amāvāsyā. Doyl is made471 to say 'in my worship pratipad which is joined to amāvāsyā should not be accepted; pratipad existing only for a muhūrta (two ghatikās) at sunrise and then joined to the 2nd tithi should be accepted ( for commencing Navarātra festival)'. On the other hand there4710 are texts like the following: if one were to accept for the (beginning of the ) worship of Caņdikā pratipad joined to part of 2nd tithi through ignorance or through another's advice, that leads to the death of that person's son. The Sama yamayūkha says that both classes of texts are baseless or if they are authoritative they leave the matter undecided as they are opposed to each other. The decision has to be arrived at in a different manner. 'If pratipad is mixed with amāvāsyā but does not exist the next day, then it must be accepted for starting Navarātra as there is no other alternative. Therefore, even a pratipad mixed with amāvāsyā has to be accepted in such a case in spite of texts to the contrary. If pratipad starts with sunrise and spreads over the next day for less than three muhurtas,

then the full pratipad has to be accepted for beginning nava rātra. If at first there is amāyāsyā for one muhūrta, then pratipad follows and then spreads over the next day up to less than three muhurtas, then this latter, that is, pratipad mixed with dvitīyā has to be accepted as the beginning. For want of space all possible alternatives are not dealt with here. 

One important matter was not stressed above. On the first day of Navarātra one has to establish a kalasa or ghata. A full kalasa has been a symbol of holiness and prosperity from early Vedic times (compare Rg. III. 32.15 'āpārņo asya kalaśaḥ'). This is a rite which is performed in the Deccan, Gujarat and Saurāştra even though the elaborate Durgāpūjā of Bengal finds no place there. The procedure given in Durgābhaktitarangiņi p. 3. Nirpayasindhu (p. 767), Vratarāja (pp. 62–66), Puruşārtha cintīmaņi (pp. 66-67) and other works is elaborate. Ghata sthāpana is spoken of in Durgārcanapaddhati (p. 663) and has to be performed by day and not at night. One should make 472 an altar with holy clay and sow yava and wheat grains thereon with Rg. X. 97. 22, and establish a jar there of gold, silver, copper or clay with Rg. IX. 17. 4, fill the jar with water with Rg. X. 75.5 (imam me Gange &c.), and cast in the jar sandal wood paste, sarvauşadhi, 473 dūrvā grass, leaves of five trees (mango &c.), clay from seven places, fruit, five jewels and gold with appropriate mantras, surround it with a piece of cloth with Rg. III. 8. 4, place a pūrņa-pātra (a cup filled with rice grains) on the jar and worship Varupa thereon, contemplate on Durgā (as described in note 418) and invoke Durgā to come and be present in the jar along with all groups of gods and offer the upacāras from pādya onwards, fold his hands, offer a prayer and boiled rice with māsa pulse or a kūşmāņda &c. In the Deccan the main items in the Navarātra are the establishment of ghata, offering a garland of flowers on every tithi up to the 9th, a strict

code of conduct (such as not shaving oneself) to be observed by the performer. If on the pratipad day on which the jar is to be established there is citrā-naksatra 474 and the astrological con. junction called Vaidhrti, it is to be done at the end of these, but if these two exist the whole of the day, then the rite should be performed in the latter part of these two. The S. M. held that these texts were baseless. According to Ghosh (p. 76), in Bengal nine jars are established in a figure (sarratobhadra) filled with coloured powders at prescribed places and these are decorated with nine differently coloured flags. But in some parts of India only one ghata is established. 

Hemādri (on Vrata, vol. I. p. 906 ) quotes Devipurāņa for honouring horses.75 The Durgāpūjā was meant for all. Kings and such men as kept horses were advised to honour horses in Navarātra from the 2nd tithi in conjunction with Svāti-paksatra up to 9th tithi. The Durgābhaktitarangiņi devotes several pages to this nirājana of horses from Sālihotra, Bhoja, Varāba mihira and other authorities (pp. 56-63 and 67-69). Kings were advised to perform Lohabhisārika rite about horses from Asvin śukla first to Mahinavamı (H. V. I. 910-916, N. S. 178, R. N.P. 414-416). For Lohābhihārika or Nirājana rite, vide H. of Dh. Vol III. p. 230 notes 309-311 and p. 910 note 1773. Although the Křtyakalpataru (on vrata) does not speak of Durgotsava on the linos stated above, the Naiyatakālika section of that work (pp. 408-410) quotes a long passage from the Bhavisyapurāņa 176 which states that Mahisa was killed by Candikā and therefore she should be worshipped on navami, all varpas should worship her, kings should fast on it and gifts should be made; the Devi is pleased by the offering of the

The Krtyakalpataru on Vrata does contain a vrata called Durgāstamiyrata derived from the Devipurāna (pp. 225-233), but it has nothing to do with the exploits of Durgā. 

Hemādri also (on vrata, vol. I. pp. 856-862) contains the same vrata with a few variations. That vrata is entirely different from the Durgotsava described in the Kālikāpurāņa. In the first place there is no reference in it to the killing of Mahişāsura. In the next place, that vrata is described as beginning from the 8th of Srāvana-sukla and going on for one year in each succeeding month on the 8th of the bright half. Feeding virgins and brāhmaṇas is mentioned in it also, but in each month the food offered to Devi and to the virgins is generally different. 

About the antiquity of the worship of Durgā, vide H. of Dh. Vol. II pp. 738–739. A few matters that were not and that could not be mentioned there are noted here. Ambikā is said to be the sister of Siya in Tai. 177 S., but in the times of the Tai. Ār. X 18 Siva is said to be the husband of Ambikā or Uma In the Vanaparva chap. 6 (where there is a long laud of Durgā 478 by Yudhisthira), she is described as the daughter of Yaśodā and Nanda and as the sister of Vasudeva, is addressed as Kāli, Mabākāli and Durgā, in verses 10-11 the weapons carried by her in her hands are mentioned and in verse 15 she is said to have destroyed Mahişāsura. When Arjuna (in Bhisma 23) offers a Durgāstotra at the bidding of Kțsna, he gives her several names, among which are Kumāri, Kali, Kapāli, Kapilā, Bhadrakāli, Mahākāli, Candi, Kātyāyani, Kauśiki, Umā. But as the dates of these passages in the Mahābhārata are far from certain no chronological conclusion can be stated. Literary works and

coins supply some firm data about the antiquity of the Durga cult. In the Raghuvamsa chap. II a lion is said to have been appointed a guard to protect a dela jārū (pino) tres planted by Pārvati. Pārvati is called Gauri in Raghu. II. 26 and in Kumāra sambhava. VII. 95 and Bhavāni in Kumārao (VII. 84), Capdi in Meghadūta (I. 33). Similarly, in the Kumārasambhava the Ardhanārīśvara form of Siva is mentioned.479 The mātrs are referred to in the same work (VII. 30, 38) and also Kāli with skulls as ornaments (ibid. VII. 39). In the Mālati-mādhava (Act V) the offering of human victims to Cāmundā in the city of Padmavati is mentioned. In the Mșcchakatika VI. 27 the legend of the killing of Sumbha and Niśumbha by Durgā occurs. If we hold that Kālidāsa flourished between 350-450 A. D., the above evidence makes it quite probable that the worship of Durgā may go back some centuries before 300 A. D. The evid ence of coins lends support to this conclusion. A siñhavāhini goddess is seen on the reverse of the coins of Candragupta I of the Gupta 480 dynasty (about 305-325 A. D.). "On a coin of the late Kuşāņa king Kaneshko the reverse shows the figure of a goddess with a lunar crescent seated 'full face on a lion crouching left and the godddess appears to have a noose and sceptre.481 The lion as vehicle and the noose indicate that the goddess should be Durgā and not Laksml. This would take us to the first or 2nd century A. D. 

Why two Navarātras were recognized in Caitra and Āśvina) is a matter of conjecture. It is possible that these two pūjās arose from the fact that spring crops and autumn crops became ready at these two times. The worship of Durga was very much influenced by Sākta doctrines and practices. Ghosh in his work on 'Durgāpūjā' (p. XVI ff.) tries to establish that the Vedic idea of Dawn (Uşas) spreading over the sky was changed by the Puranas and Tantras into the terrific goddess Durgā. I am not prepared to accept this explanation at all, as the links between the Vedic goddess Dawn and the terrible goddess of the Kālikā-purāņa are altogether wanting and as there is a gap of many centuries between the disappearance of Usas from the ancient pantheon and popular worship and the emergence of Durga. There may be some astrological connec

tion between Durgā ( Virgo ) riding a lion (Leo). But this also cannot be clearly made out. 

In the Indian Historical Quarterly vol. 21 (pp. 227–231 ) Mr. N. G. Banerjee refers to the Durgotsava-paddhati of Udaya simha which begins with the Mahānavami and a sankalpa for victory and ends with the description of horses marching on dasami to victory and avers that this work indicates that Durgapūjā was originally a military rite and was later on trans formed into a religious festival. He relies upon the description in the Raghuvamsa (IV. 24-25) how the advent of Sarad (autumn) season impelled Raghu to march on an invasion and to perforin the śānti rite for horses called Aśvanīrājana and also on the Bșhatsamhitā. chap. 44 (Kern's ed.) where occurs an elaborate description of the nirājana of horses, elephants and fighters on the 8th, 12th, or 15th of the bright half of Āśvina or Kārtika. There are serious objections against accepting this theory. It is not unknown that unconnected celebrations may be joined together on the same tithi or tithis. For example, in many parts of North India the Rāmalīlā festival for ten days is associated with Navarātra days. But Navarātra and Rāmalila are independent of each other and in some parts even of North India, only one or the other is popular and celebrated and not both. There is nothing improbable in there being two occasions for nirājana, one in Durgotsaya and another on the occasion of a king's march on an invasion. Besides, a work of the 15th century can hardly be relied upon as evidence for explaining the origin of a festival that was in vogue for about a thousand years at least before that work. Moreover, if it was the usage to celebrate the marching on an invasion in Āśvina with nbrājana (lustration), that rite might have been borrowed from that in Durgotsava by analogy instead of the utsava having adopted the military usage. The Kālikā-purāṇa which describes at length Durgotsava also speaks of the nirājana in Āśvina sukla on the 8th and the worship of a noble handsome horse fot seven days with sandalwood paste, flowers &c. and requires the observation of the horse's movements for drawing prognosticsa tions (chap. 88.15–75). There is nothing to show that the details of Durgotsava described in the Kālikā and other purāņas did not exist in the 4th, 5th and 6th centuries A. D. when Kālidāsa and Varāhamihira flourished and mentioned the lustration of horses. The theory of Mr. N. G. Banerjee appears to be unwarranted by the evidence so far available and cannot be accepted. 

CHAPTER X 

Vijayādaśami and Divali 

The 10th tithi of Asvina-sukla is called Vijayā-daśaml. It is elaborately described in Hemādri (on vrata, vol. 1. pp. 970-973), Nirnayasindhu (pp. 69-70), Purusārtha-cintāmapi (pp. 145-148), Vratarāja (pp. 359-361) and Kālatattva-vivecana (pp. 309-312), Dharmasindhu (p. 96). As Dasami (10th tithi) is not mentioned in the Yugmarākya the Kālanirnaya relies on a verse that in the bright half that tithi which exists at sunrise should be accepted for performance of rites and in the dark half the one that exists at sunset.482 Hemādri proposed (on vrata vol. I. p. 973) two simple rules (when 10th is viddhā) that that tithi on which Śravana-naksatra exists should be accepted and in all other cases 10th mixed with 9th be accepted. But the other digests introduce many other considerations and complicated rules follow. A few of them are given below. If the 10th tithi is mixed up with 9th and 11th, the day on which it is mixed with 9th should be accepted provided there is no Sravana naksatra on the next. The Skanda says: Aparājitā-devi should be worshipped by men on the 10th towards the north-east and in the afternoon, when the 10th is mixed with 9th. Aparājita should be worshipped on that day for welfare and victory. Another verse 482a is 'A person should offer worship on the 10th tithi in Āśvina bright half and should not perform the worship of Aparājitā on Ekādaśī.' It must be remembered that the proper time for Vijayā-daśami rites is aparāhna (afternoon) and pradoşa 425 is gaupakāla (secondary time). If 10th extends over aparāhna on two days, the first (i. e. 10th mixed with 9th) should be accepted. If the 10th exists at pradosa time (but not at aparāhna) on two days, then the later (viz. 10th mixed with 11th) should be accepted; Sravana is not decisive just as Rohiņi in

Janmāstamni is not. If on both days the tenth tithi does not exist at the time of aparāhna then the first (10th mixed with 9th) is to be accepted; but in this case if on the 2nd day Sravana-naksatra exists at the time of aparāhna then the latter (10th mixed with 11th) is to be accepted. These are the conclusions of N. S. The P. C. (p. 148) disputes the last proposition. Hemādri and follow ing him Nirnayasindhu (p. 189) quote Kasyapa 483 to the follow ing effect: 'if daśami exists for some time at sunrise and if there is then ekādaśī for the rest of that day and there is Śravana-naksatra at aparāhna on that day, that tithi is called Vijayā; since Rāma started on his invasion (against Rāvana) on Śravaņa-naksatra, men should celebrate the crossing of the limits of their village on that day and naksatra'. The Nirnaya sindhu and other works quote a verse434 "That time (on 10th tithi in Aśvina) which is slightly later than evening twilight and when the stars have just begun to appear is to be known as Vijaya and tends to the success of all undertakings.' Bhrgu says 'the 485 11th muhurta (on a day of 15 muhurtas) is called Vijaya) all desirous of victory should march out at that time. These verses explain why this tithi is called Vijaya-daśami. These two verses show that the time called Vijaya is of two kinds. 

The Vijayadaśami is one of the three most auspicious days in the year (the other two being Caitra-sukla first tithi and Kartika-sukla ist). Therefore in India children begin to learn the alphabet on this day (i. e. perform Sarasvatipūjana), people start now undertakings on this day, even when the moon and the like are not astrologically favourable 486 and if the

king marches against his foes on this tithi when there is Sravana-nakşatra it is very auspicious and brings to him victory and peace. 

On this day the principal acts are the worship of Aparājitā, the worship of Sami, Simollanghana (crossing the boundary of one's village), returning home and having a lamp waved before oneself by the women in the house, wearing new clothes and ornaments and in the case of a king, nīrājana of the horses, elephants, soldiers and marching out. 

Dasarā or Vijayādaśami is a great day for people of all castes, but it is specially a day for the ksatriyas, the nobles and kings. 

The procedure of the worship of Aparājitā (invincible) Devi is briefly as follows (from Dharmasindhu p. 96). In the after noon one should go to the north-east of one's village, smear the earth (with cowdung) on a pure spot, should draw with sandal wood paste or the like a figure with eight segments, should make a sankalpa as in the note and should invoke Aparājitā in the midst of that figure with the words 'salutations to Aparājitā' and also invoke Jaya and Vijayā to the right and left of Aparajitā respectively with the words 'salutation to Kriyāsakti' and 'salutation to Uma' respectively. He should then offer worship with sixteen upacaras to Aparajitā, Jaya and Vijayā with the mantras 'Aparājitayai namah, Jayāyai namah, Vijayāyai namah' and offer the prayer 'O Dovil accepting this pūjā which I have offered to you according to my ability, for my protection may you go to your own place'. In the case of the king he should pray for victory in the words May Aparājitā wearing a striking necklace and resplendent golden girdle and fond of doing good bestow victory on me' and then he should take leave of her in the words 'O Devil &c.'. Then all people should go out of the village to Sami (Mimosa Suma) tree grow ing in the north-east, offer worship to it. People may perform the crossing of the boundary of the village before or after the worship of Saml. Some provide that the images of Rāma and Sitā should be worshipped on Vijayādaśaml, since Rāma con quered Lankā on this day (A. K, folio 2189 ).487

191 

In the case of the king the procedure described by Hemādri (on vrata vol. I. pp. 970-71) is as follows: the king coming out of bis palace should be preceded by his purohita and after per forming the rites on starting for a journey should march towards the east; after reaching the end of the capital he should perform Vāstupājā (worship of a site) and worship the guardians of the quarters and the devatis (in temples) he may meet on the road. He should then offer worship to Sami tree with Paurāņika mantra 488 I take refuge with the blessed and auspicious Sami tree, that removes all inauspicious things and evil acts and the effects of bad dreams'; then he (the king) should take first towards the east and towards other directions the Vişņu stops. After making an effigy of his enemy or merely bringing him before his mind he (the king) should pierce him in the heart with an arrow 189 with a golden shaft. The purohita recites verses about the victory of the king in the quarters; the king should honour worthy brāhmaṇas, the astrologer and purohita and should arrange sports of elephants, horses and foot-soldiers. He should then enter his palace to the accompaniment of auspicious shouts like 'Jaya' and lights should be waved before him by courtezans. The king who performs every year this auspicious ceremony secures long life, health, prosperity and victory; he suffers from no ailments physical or mental nor defeat and obtains unblemished wealth and victory in the world. If a king 490 starts on an invasion without celebrating Vijaya daśami he would secure no victory for a year in his kingdom. The Tithi-tattva quotes Rājamārtanda 491 to the effect that if for any reason the king cannot march out in person on Vijaya daśami he should send out his umbrella or favourite weapon for a victorious march.

late medieval works add some verses about Sami and other details.492 “Sami destroys sin, Sami has reddish thorns, it held (concealed) the arrows of Arjuna and it appealed lovingly to Rāma. O Sami worshipped by Rāma! May you rernove obstacles on the march that I am to undertake according to my convenience and ease'. If a Sami tree is not available, then the aśmantaka tree 493 should be worshipped with a mantra (given in note below). Taking up a little wet clay from the root of the sami tres together with akşatas one should bring it to one's house to the accompaniment of songs and loud instrumental music; then the person should wear new apparel and ornaments along with his relatives and lights should be waved before him as an auspicious rite by chaste young women.494 

In modern times on Vijayādaśami there is šamīpājā in many parts of India. But śami is a rare tree. In Mahārāştra and Konkana, twigs of a tree called Aptā are brought from the forest and arranged in the form of a bush near a temple and in the afternoon the people of a town or village engage in a sort of mock scramble for taking away twigs of Āptā and distribute the leaves among their neighbours, friends and relatives saying 'take this gold'. In Syurāstra and in several other places there is no such distribution of leaves. The Dharmasindhu notes that common people (in Mahārāstra) cut off twigs of sami and take them to their houses but that this has no śāstra basis. 495 In some places a he-buffalo or a goat was formerly sacrificed on this day. In the former princely States of India such as Baroda and Mysore

durbars were held on Vijayadasami (or Dasarā, as it is called) and grand processions with richly caparisoned elephants and pranc ing horses were taken out on the streets of the capital The kings in ancient and medieval times performed the Nīrājana ceremony of horses and elephants, soldiers and the king himself. Kālidāsa mentions that when śarad came Raghu performed the śānti rite called vājinirājana (Raghuvamsa IV. 24-25). In his Bțhatsamhitā (chap. 44. ed. by Kern) Varāha describes at length lustration rites for horses, elephants and men The Nirnaya sindhu sets out the mantras at the time of nirajana of the army 'O goddess, ruling over gods! may my army divided into four sections (elephants, chariots, horsemen and foot-soldiers) attain to the position of having no enemy left in this world and may victory come to me everywhere through your favour.' The Tithi tattva provides that the king after performing nirājana for vigour to his army should see the fine khañjana bird in the vicinity of water or cowpens and address it with the mantra 4% 'O khanja rīțabird! you have come to the earth, you have a blue and auspi cious neck and you bestow all desires; salutation to you! The Tithitattva then (p. 103) descants upon the conclusions about the future to be drawn from the several places where the khañjarita (wagtail) is seen and from the directions in which it is seen. The Brhatsamhitā has a chapter (45) on the augurieś to be drawn from the sight of the khañjana bird, almost the whole of which is quoted by the Kṛtyaratnākara (pp. 366-373) and a few verses of which are quoted by Varsakriyakaumudi pp. 450-51. In Manu V. 14 and Yāj. I. 174 among the birds whose flesh is for bidden for eating is khañjarita (probably because it was such a valuable bird for prognostications). 

In some parts of Northern India Rāmalilā celebrations go on for ten days and culminate on the 10th of Āśvina in the burning of a tall hollow paper and wickerwork structure conceal ing crackers representing Rāvana and his hosts. 

There are several other local customs and Usages such as worship of weapons of war and implements of one's trade or avocation associated with Dasarā or Vijayādaśams which are passed over here for reasons of space.

(Sec. I, CH, X 

There are many conjectures about the origin of the Dasarā festival. Some, relying on the usages of some parts of India to offer to gods ears of new corn, of hanging on the doors of the house the ears of green or unripe paddy and of putting in the turban young sprouts of wheat and the like, hold that it is more or less an agricultural festival. Others hold that as, about Dasarā monsoon rains stop, swollen rivers abate and crops are near being garnered, it is the most suitable time for marching on an expedition and that therefore the origin is due to military exigencies. I incline to the latter view. In ancient countries other than India, there was a fixed season when kings went to battle. For example, we read in II Samuel chap. 11.1 'And it came to pass, after the year was expired, at the time when kings go forth to battle, that, David sont Joab. The cult of Sami is very ancient. Two logs of wood (uraņis) from an Aśvattha tree growing inside a Saml were employed in producing fire by attrition for Vedic sacrifices. Fire symbolizes vigour and valour and logs of Saml are helpful in producing fire and sami wood is very hard. In the Atharva veda (VII. 11.1) we have the words 'the Aśvattha tree rides Sami'. The Tai. Br. I. 2. 1. 16 refers to Agni being produced from Aśvattha that is ‘Samigarbha' and Tai. Br. I. 2. 1.7 con nects Sami with śānti (the removal of adverse signs). In the Tai. Ā. (VI. 9.2.) we read O Samil remove from us (destroy) sins and enmities' (sami śamayāsmad-aghā dveşāmsi). It had somo affinity with Navarātra also, as the latter celebrates the military exploit of Dovi against Mahisāsura, and was therefore celebrated immediately after Navarātra. The word 'Dasarā' is derived from 'daśa' meaning 10 and 'aban' (a day). 

Divāli: This festival of lights, illuminations and fireworks is the most joyful of all festivals and is most widely observed throughout India. Observances, however, differ in detail and number from age to age and from province to province. It is not a single festival in honour of a single god or goddess as the Krsnajanmāstami or the Navaratra is. It is spread over four or five days and contains several independent items. The days of Dipāvali properly so called are three. It is called Dipāvali (row of lamps) in many works, but also Dīpālikā (in colophon to chap. 140 of Bhavisyottara). When emphasis is laid only on one item in this festival of several days it is also designated Sukharātrī in Rājamārtapda (verses 1346-1348, vide ABORI Vol.36Divali

In a scholarly paper contributed to the Journal of the Ganganath Jha Institute (vol. III. pp. 205-216 ) Prof. P. K. Gode traces the antiquity of this festival. The Bhavisyottara contains a charming verse with a double entendre 498 'May this auspicious day of lights remove your sins like Rāmāyaṇa in which the thunder of clouds is stopped (or in which Meghanāda i. e. Indrajit, son of Rāvana, is described as killed), in which the tips of wicks are burning (or in which Rāvana became infuriated) and in which young women find delight (or with which Rāma is pleased). Some works like the N. S. and Kālatattvavivecana (p. 315 ) hold that the three days viz. 14th, amāvāsya and Kārtika first, constitute the Kaumudi festival.499 

Taken all in all Dipāvali spreads over about five days. The whole festival comprises five principal items spread over five days, viz. worship of wealth, the celebration of Vispu's victory over Narakāsura, worship of Laksmi, victory of Vişņu over Bali and dice-play and the exchange of brotherly and sisterly affection. There are illuminations and the discharge of crackers on almost all the five days from the 13th of the dark half of Aśvina. This last is called in Gujarat and Saurāştra 'Dhanteras'. Before and on this day houses are painted and decorated, the courtyards of houses are cleaned, and metal vessels are polished and illuminations begin. The Padmapurāna VI. 124. 4 refors to illuminations on the 13th of the dark half of Kartika (by the pūrnimānta reckoning).

The Bhavisyottara contains a lengthy description of the four days of the Divāļi festival from the 14th. I shall take that chapter as basis and add, where necessary, other passages from other texts. 

On the 14th of the dark half of Asvina 501 (or of Kārtika in the pūrnimānta reckoning) persons afraid of Hell should take an oil bath at the time of daybreak, should whirl over their heads the twigs of Apāmārga tree together with clods of ploughed land and the thorns (of the twigs). The mantra to be repeated is noted below.502 Then the purāņa provides for tarpana (satiation with añjalis of water &c. mixed with sesame) to Yama and mentions seven names of Yama.503 Then the purāna provides that a lamp should be lit for Naraka (i. e. for the avoidance of Naraka) and that in the evening illumination with charming lamps should be provided in the temples of Brahmā, Visnu, Siva and others, in mathas (monasteries), in rooms for implements, on caityas (mounds on which sacred trees grow), in assembly halls, on rivers, and ramparts, in parks, wells, principal roads and in the women's apartments, in shrines of siddhas, Arhats (Jaina saints), Buddha, Cāmuṇdā, Bhairava, in isolated stables for horses and elephants (verses 15–17). Other texts provide that on this day

in the midst of the bath one should whirl over one's body twiga and leaves of apāmārga or of gourd or of prapunnāta (called Taklā in Marathi) for the removal of hell and that one should light a lamp with four wicks in memory of Narakasura. It was helieved504 that Laksmi came to dwell in oil and the Ganges came to all waters on the 14th in Dipāvali and he who would take an oil bath on this morning would not see the world of Yama. In modern times, people in the Deccan after their bath on 14th crush under their foot a bitter fruit called Kārīt, which probably represents Narakāsura. The oil bath was to be taken about the time of arunodaya, but if for some reason it could not be done then it may be taken even after sunrise.505 The Dharmasindhu says that even yatis (ascetics) should undergo the oil bath on this day. It appears probable that originally the 14th was called Narakacaturdaśī because Yama was to be propitiated for fear of Hell. Later on the legend about the killing by Krsna of Narakāsura, king of Prāgjyotişa city (Kāmarūpa), said to have been born of the Earth when it came in contact with the Varāha incarnation of Vişnu, was pressed into gervice. People now-adays remember only Narakāsura on this day and hardly any one performs Yamatarpana.506 The depreda tions of Narakasura are narrated in the Visnupurāņa V. 29 and in the Bhāgavata X. (uttarārdha) chap. 59. He deprived Aditi, the mother of gods, of her ear ornaments, Varuņa of his umbrella, Mandara of a peak called Maniparvata and kidnapped 16100 girls of gods, siddhas and kings and imprisoned them in his palace.s7 Krsṇa killed him and if Purāņa descriptions are to be treated as historical Krsna's actions were prompted by great pity

and he raised the status of these unfortunate women by marry ing them all. 

The Tithitattva notes that there is a usage of eating fourteen kinds of vegetables on this day in order to correspond with the 14th tithi, enumerates them from Nirnayāmrta and recommends that this should be followed. 508 

Several works such as the Varsakriyā-kaumudi and the Dharmasindhu prescribe that 509 on the evenings of the 14th of the dark half and amāvāsyā of Āśvina men with firebrands in their hands should show the way to their pitrs (deceased ancestors) with the mantra 'May those men in my family who were cremated and those who had no cremation performed for them and those that were burnt only by resplendent fire (without religious rites?), reach the highest state (or goal); may those (pitrs) who, leaving the world of Yama, came for the Mahālaya śrūddhas (in the dark half of Bhādrapada or Āśvina acc. to pūrnimānta reckoning) find their way by the brilliant light (of the firebrands) and reach (their own worlds). 

The medieval texts prescribe on 14th of Aśvina 510 dark half the performance of the following acts, viz. oil bath, tarpana of Yama, lighting lamp for Naraka, illuminations at night, holding firebrands, worship of Siva, worship of Mahārātri, taking food at night only. Out of these only three (viz. oil bath, lighting a lamp for Naraka and night illumination) are now-adays generally performed and the rest are omitted. After the bath people put on new clothes and ornamonts and take a repast of sweets and the like and in the noon there is a sumptous feast. There is a good deal of discussion in the Nirnayasindhu (p. 197), P. C. (p. 241), Dharmasindhu (p. 104) about the time when oil bath is to be taken, if the 14th is mixed up with the 13th and amāvāsyā. That is passed over here.

Narakacaturdaši is also called Bhūtacaturdaśī in Krtyatattva ( p. 450 ). 

On all the three days, viz. 14th of dark half of Āśvina, ami vāsyā, and the first of Kārtika-sukla an oil bath in the morning is prescribed for him who desires wealth and prosperity. 

Āśyina amāvāsyā is a very important day. One should take an oil bath in the morning 511 and perform the worship of Lakşmi for the removal of alakṣmi (bad luck, penury). Some texts add that the barks of five trees 512 should be boiled in water for the bath and the person should have lights waved before him by women. The Bhavisyottara (in chap. 140, verses 14-29) describes the celebrations on amāvāsyā at some length. Briefly it comes to this. In the morning one should take (an oil) bath, worship gods and pitȚs and perform the pārvana śrāddha with curds, milk, ghee and feed brāhmanas with various edibles. Then in the afternoon the king should proclaim in his capital 'today is the sovereignty of Bali; O people I enjoy yourselves'. People also in their houses should make merry with dance and music, should offer tāmbūla to each other and anoint their bodies with saffron powder, dress themselves in silken robes and wear gold and jewels, young women move about in groups wearing brilliant clothes, the houses should be full of rows of lamps, handsome maidens should cast rice grains about and the waving of lamps ( nīrājana) should be resorted to which confers victory. Towards midnight the king should move about in the capital on foot to see the fan and charm of the festival and then return to his palace. When midnight is past and people's eyes are heavy with approaching sleep, the women in the city should create great noise by beating winnowing baskets and drums and should drive out alakşmi (ill luck) from the court yards of their houses. Hemādri (on vrata vol. II. pp. 348–349) quotes from Bhavisya certain additional items: 'no one except children or ailing persons should take a meal by day, one should worship Lakşmi in the evening and should illuminate with treelike rows of lights shrines of gods, squares where four roads meet, cemeteries, rivers, mountains, houses, bottoms of trees, cowpens, caves. They should decorate shops where merchandise is bought and sold with white cloth and flowers, then feed

brāhmaṇas and hungry persons in places surrounded by lamps and take dinner dressed in white garments and decked with ornaments. The Nilamata-purāna calls this amāvāsyā night 'Sukh-suptikā' and describes it (verses 505-510) in the same way as Hemādri's quotation does. 513 In Bengal Kāli is worshipped on this day, who it is said is both Laksmi and Sarasvati. In modern times this is a day specially for merchants and traders. On this day they worship their books of account, invite friends, customers and other traders and give them tāmbūla and some sweets. Old accounts are closed and new ones opened. There is a popular legend that Brahmā gave to brāhmanas raksābandhana (Srāvaņa Full Moon day) as their festival, Dasarā to ksatriyas, Divāls to traders and Holikā to Sūdras. The night of the worship of Lakşmi 514 is called Sukharātri, since Lakşmi gives up her sleep on the amāvāsyā when the sun is in Libra (or Balance ) and it is provided in some works that at the dawn of Sukharātri when the house is illuminated by lamps one should honour one's relatives with words of complimentary queries and worship Lakşmi, that removes the taint of ill luck, with auspicious flowers, sandal wood paste, curds, yellow pigment and fruits. The Krtyatattva quotes a verse "when there is 14th tithi in a portion of the day and there is amāvāsyā on the night of that day Lakşmi should be worshipped and (that night) should be known as Sukharātrikā" and then gives an elaborate procedure of the worship of Laksmi. Some works such as the Varşakriya kaumudi, Kṛtyatattva (p. 452 ) and Dharmasindhu (p. 107 )

provides that on this Sukharātri not only Lakşmi but also Kubera 515 is to be worshipped. 

The first of Kārtika-sukla is regarded as one of the three most auspicious days of the year. The Dharmasindhu 516 remarks that though the three days from the 14th tithi are designated Dipāvali yet that day which has Svāti-naksatra is most commended. It may be stated that Balipratipada is often conjoined to Svāti-nakşatra. On this day also an oil bath is obligatory. The most important item on this tithi is the worship of Bali. The Bhavisyottara (140. 47-73) describes this worship of Bali as follows: The king should at night draw the figure of Bali having two arms on a circle made on the ground with five coloured powders; the image should have all ornaments and should have Vindhyāvali (Bali's queen) near him, should be surrounded by asuras like Kūşmānda, Bāņa, Mura and others, should wear a crown and ear ornaments; the king should himself offer worship in the midst of his palace together with his brothers and ministers with several kinds of lotuses and offer sandalwood paste, incense and naivedya of food including wine and meat and employ the following mantra 517 € salutation to you, O king Bali, son of Virocana, enemy of gods and the future Indra, accept this worship.' Having thus worshipped he should keep awake at night by arranging for dramatic spectacles presented by actors based on stories about ksatriyas. Ordinary people also should establish inside their houses on a couch the image of king Bali made with white rice grains and worship it with flowers and fruits. Whatever gifts,518 large or small, are made

on this day become inexhaustible and bring delight to Visnu. The Krtyatattva (p. 453) provides that three añjalis of flowers should be offered to Bali. The Bhavisyottara adds 'this tithi increases the dominion of Bali; baths and gifts made on this tithi in Kārtika yield a hundredfold reward.' 

If the pratipad is mixed with amāvāsyā or dvitiya, the worship of Bali, the proper time of which is night, should be performed on pratipad mixed with amāvāsyā, since Hemādri quotes from Padma 'Sivarātri and Bali's day should be observed on the day when the tithi is mixed with the preceding tithi' and on account of the yugma-rūkya. Mādhava also is of the same 519 opinion. 

Bali was the son of Virocana and grandson of Prahlada, a great devotee of Visnu. In the Vanaparva (28.2) Bali asks his grandfather Prahlada the question which is better, kşamā (for bearance) or tejas' (vigorous action). In the Santiparva 225. 13 it is said that Bali felt jealous of brāhmanas. The story of Bali who had become very powerful and made gods lose their tejas is narrated in Brahmapurāna 73, Kūrma I. 17, Vāmana chap. 77 and 92, Matsya chap. 245-246 and Bhavisyottara 140. Bali began an Aśvamedha. Visņu assumed the form of a dwarf brāhmaṇa student and begged for land that would be measured by his three steps. Though warned by Sukra that the dwarf was really Vişnu, Bali promised to give land equal to three steps. Then the dwarf grew larger and larger and covered heaven and earth in two steps. When Vāmana asked Bali where to plant the third step Bali told him to plant it on his back and thus Bali was thrust into the nether regions. Visņu being 520 pleased with

Bali's adherence to his plighted word conferred on Bali the averlordship of pūtāla and the position of the future Indra. This story is an ancient one. The Mahābhāşya 521 on Dānini III. I. 26 states that when a person recites the story of Bali's imprison ment (in pātāla by Visņu) or represents it on the stage people use such phraseology as Balim bandhayati' (he imprisons Bali), though Bali was imprisoned a long time ago. This makes it certain that the story was embodied in dramas and poems more than two thousand years ago, 

The Balipratipadā appears to be called Virapratipadā 522 in the Vāmana-purāna. It is also called Dyūtapratipad (Krtyatattva p. 452). The purāņas 523 say that on that day Siva was defeated in dice-play by Parvati, that Sankara became sad, while Gauri remained happy. Therefore, on this day in the morning men should resort to gambling. Whoever succeeded on this day in gambling would find that the whole year there after was beneficial to him but if he suffered defeat in gambling that day he would lose his wealth that year. In Ellora cave No. 21 Sankara and Pārvati are shown as playing with dice; vide plate 38 in 'Ellora' by Balasaheb Pant-Pratinidhi of Aundh. In many parts of India people engage on this day in gambling and fortunes are often lost or made on this day. Even in a com paratively small country like Nepal gambling stakes soared up to three million rupees in 1955 on the Balipratipad day.

On this day also there should be illuminations. It is said "by lightings24 lamps during (the day of) Bali's domination Lakşmi becomes stable; this is called Dīpāvali because there is waving of lights in this festival. Having reached (the day of) Bali's domination how will lamps be burning in the houses of those who do not observe the festival of the rows of lamps?' 

The Dharmasindhu furnishes525 a long list of the observances on this pratipad day according to the several purānas and digests, viz. worship of Bali, illuminations, holiday for and worship of cows and bulls, worship of Govardhana, the tying of Margapali (lit. protectress of the road), wearing new clothes, dice-play, waving of lights before men by women (whose husbands are alive), and tying up an auspicious garland. In 

modern times only three out of these, viz.. worship of Bali, illu minations and gambling are observed and the rest are hardly observed anywhere. Therefore only brief references will be made to the rest. Cows, calves and bulls are to be worshipped with two mantras (quoted in note ) and decorated and cows are not to be milked and bulls are not to be made to carry burdens this day. This is to be done in the morning of Kārtika pratipad. If it be mixed up with 526 the 2nd it should not be done on that day as that would lead to the death of one's sons, wife and loss of wealth, but this should be observed when pratipad is mixed with amāyāsyā. Devala prescribes this and remarks that by the wor ship of cows three prosper, viz. people, cows and the king. As regards Govardhana-pājā, those who are in the vicinity of Govar

dhana (a hill near Mathurā) should go to it and worship in the morning, while others not near it should prepare a Govardhana with cowdung or with heaps of cooked food or draw it in a picture and worship it along with Gopāla (Krsna) and offer all the 16 upacāras to Govardhana and Gopala (Krsna) with mantras which pointedly refer to Krsna's giving protection to the settlement of cowherds (Gokula) against the heavy down pour of rain to the discomfiture of Indra. The sankalpa is given in the note.527 The naivedya is to be on a grand scale. Therefore, the Smrtikaustubha (p. 174) states that Govardhana pūjā 528 is called Annakūta (heap or hill of food) in Padma purāna. Vide Var. 164 for Govardhana and Annakūtaparikrama. The Dharmasindhu provides that a homa should be performed with the two verses 'ā gāvo agman' (Rg. VI. 28.1) and 'praite vadantu' (Rg. X. 94. 1). Mukerji (pp. 150–152) describes how Govardhana-pūjā is carried on in some out-of-the way rural tracts in United Provinces, though it has become altogether defunct elsewhere. Vide I. A. vol. 60 pp. 187-190 and vol. 61 pp. 1 ff and pp. 231 ff for description of the Gāyadāpr festival observed in Bihar, Orissa and some other parts on Kārtika first of bright half in the afternoon in which cows gaily stamped with circular stains of red and blue on their skin and horns glistening with oil and red ochre chased a puny pig with their pointed horns and killed it. 

In the afternoon of the pratipad (Kārtika-sukla) the tying of Mārgapāli takes place.529 A rope of kušas or kāśas (Saccha rum spontaneum) should be made according to the usage of one's family and tied to a tall pole and a tree in the east; one should bow to it and offer a prayer to it with the mantra (quoted in the note 529 ) and all including the king and brāhmanas accompanied by cows, elephants and the like should pass by the

way underneath the rope. In the same way a strong rope of kāśas or the like should be made and a tug of war should ensue, the rope being frequently pulled on one side by the princes and on the other by persons of lower castse. The pulling of the rope should be done in front of a temple or the palace or where four roads meet and an equal number of strong men should be selected for each side. A line should be drawn behind each side. If the persons of lower castes succeed in drawing the other side towards them then it should be held that the king will be victorious thereafter for one year.530 The Nirājana ceremony by women should be performed in the morning (if the pratipad is mixed with dvitiyā) and the Mangalamālikā (a series of ausp icious rites or auspicious garlands) should be performed in the evening on the 2nd tithi ( if pratipad exists only for a short time and is followed by dvitiyā). 531 

As shown above, the three days from Ăśvina-krspa 14th are spoken of as days of Kaumudimahotsava 532 The Bhavisyottara and Padma derive the word Kaumudi from 'ku' (earth) and the root mud' to be delighted; the meaning being 'in which people find delight on the earth among themselves' and then another etymology is suggested, viz. kumudas (white water lilies) are offered to Bali in this festival. 

In the Vedic period and for some centuries thereafter certain rites were performed in the month of Āśvina or in Sarad such as the Āśvayuji and Agrayana or Navasasyesti. The first is one of the seven pākayajñas mentioned by Gautama dharmasūtra (VIII. 19). The first was performed on the Full Moon day of Āśvina. Vide H. of Dh. vol. II. p. 827 for a description of Āśvayuji and pp. 827-29 for Āgrayaņa. But it is not possible to trace the Divāli festival to these rites. How the Divāli rites first arose cannot be stated with any approach to

plausibility. In the Anušāsana parva it is said that the donor of lamps shines in the heavens like a row of lights (dipapradaḥ syarga-loke dīpamāleva rājate, 98.51). Some writers regard these as a reference to the Divāli. But it is not so clear as to place the matter beyond doubt. In I. A. vol. 32 pp. 237-239 Mr. B. A. Gupte contributed a paper on 'Divaļi folklore'. He refers to the several legends and characteristics connected with the Divālī, viz. the killing of Narakāsura, depriving Bali of his empire, the crowning of Rāma and Vikrama in these days of Divāli and illuminations and says that the origin must be sought in the movement of the earth round the sun, the change of season, the end of the rice crop and the manuring of soil for the second crop. The connection he traces is rather remote and somewhat fantastic and I am afraid that his theory of origins will appeal to very few in these days. 

On the 2nd of the bright half of Kārtika occurs a very fine festival called Bhrātrdvitīyā or Yamadyitīyā. The Bhavisya states: 533 'on the 2nd tithi of Kārtika bright half Yama was treated by Yamunā to a dinner in her house; therefore this tithi be came declared in the world as Yamadyitiyā;wise men should not take mid-day meal in their own houses but they should take food from the hands of the sister through affection, as doing so increases one's welfare or prosperity. Gifts should be made to sisters; all sisters should be honoured with golden ornaments, clothes, reception and meals; but if there be no sister, one should honour a woman whom he regards as sister (uncle's or aunt's daughter or a friend's sister).' The digests add further details. One should334 do worship to Yama and Yamunā and to Citragupta, and brothers and sisters should offer arghya (water in token of respectful reception ) to Yama. The procedure is briefly this. In the morning the sister should invite the brother, make him

take at mid-day a bath with scented water and unguents rubbed on his body; she along with the brother should worship Yama and Yamunā with arghya and offer handfuls of flowers. The arghya mantra is535 'Come, come, O Yama, son of the Sun; you that carry in your hand a ņoose; accept this worship offered on Bhrātsdyitiyā and also arghya; salutation to you l' Then two more mantras may be addressed. 536 'O Dharmarāja, salutation to you, the elder brother of Yamunā; O son of the Sun, protect me along with your servants; salutation to you. Salutation to you, O Yamunā, sister of Yama and honoured by people; always confer on me favours, O daughter of the Sun, salutation to you!' After this she serves food to her brother with the verse ‘Brother I was born after you; partake of this pure food for pleasing Yama, particularly Yamunā'. If the sister be older than the brother she should say 'I was born before you'. Then after the brother finishes his meal she should deck him with sandalwood paste and then herself partake of the food. Some works like the Vratarāja (pp. 78-91) present a far more elaborate procedure, which is passed over here but two matters provided for by it may be mentioned. The first is that a person before going to his sister's house should mutter ten names of Yama (quoted in note 537). The second is that the sister is to worship images of Yama and of eight mythological personages (Mārkandeya, Bali and others) supposed to be immortal for the increase of her brother's life. 538 In modern times hardly any religious cere mony is performed except that residents of places near or on the banks of the Yamunā river (Jumna) bathe in the Jumna and there is a mela on the river on this day. The only thing generally done is the brother's visiting his sister, dining at her house, light being waved before him and his making some presents to the sister.

Divāļi-Bhrātrdvitiyā 

209 

This festival of Bhratrdvitīyā is really an independent one, but it was probably tacked on to the three festive days of Divaļi in order to lengthen out the days of fun and joy. Sisters, when after their marriage they leave their brother's home, may not meet for years and further the sister may have become rich and the brother a poor man or vice rersa. Our ancient writers evinced a koen appreciation of the bonds of disinterested affection between brothers and sisters and set apart a day in the year for their meeting to enable them to go over their sweet memories of childhood and to re-live for a day at least their early life which had gone forever. A religious tinge was added to the festival by recalling the two mythical personalities of Yama and Yami, that figure in the famous Yama-Yami hymn (Rg. X. 10). I should like to digress a little and strongly protest against the conclusion drawn by certain Western Sanskrit scholars that the hymn is an indication of the prevalence of the usage of the marriage of a brother and a sister among ancient Aryans. The hymn is a purely imaginative effort 'which bodies forth the forms of things unknown', as in the case of Rg. X. 119 where the poet imagines what Indra must have felt when treated to huge portions of Soma beverage. In Rg. X. 10.10 539 the sage makes it clear that in future ages something like what was delineated in his fantasy might occur (namely, sisters might do unsisterly acts). Macdonell in his 'Vedic Mythology' (pp. 172 173) indulges in some facile assumptions. Yama may be an Indo-Iranian divinity, but Yami does not occur in the Avesta at all, as he himself admits, but only in later Parsi writings. Therefore, what is stated in these later writings should not be foisted upon the sages of the Rgveda. He supposes that the sage in Rg. X. 10 indulges in propaganda for exonerating Yama from incest. Propaganda is well-known to Western countries in the 19th and 20th centuries A. D. The Rgveda nowhere states that the human race was produced from Yama and Yami. There is no warrant for saying that Yami is Indo-Iranian and consequently the myth of the human race being born from a brother and sister is not Indo-Iranian. Pargiter in AIHT (p. 70 ) follows the ball set rolling by Macdonell and others and boldly asserts that, when the Vayu ( in 93.12 ) says that Nahuşa had six sons born of pitřkanyā, Virajā, the 'word pitřkanya means 'sister' and Nahusa married his ‘sister or half sister' 

539. 31 T OT TCTT TA 73 4: gum . X. 10. 10. Those later ages might come when sisters might do what is not sister-like.

and that union between brother and sister was not unknown as Rgveda X, 10 about Yama and Yami shows. One suspects the motives of a writer like Pargiter who held high judicial office in India, when he does not explain why 'pitrkanyā' was used and not'svasr', when he pays no heed to the fact that in many places in Vāyu ( 72. 5, 73. 1-2, 26, 36, 40, 45, 77.74) Menā, Acchodā, Pivari, Gauḥ, Yasodā, Virajā herself, Narmadā and Gandhakalı are spoken of as 'pitrņām mānasi kanyā', that Vāyu (72), Matsya (13.2-9) and other Purānas speak of seven groups of pitrs and set out how from the mind-born daughters of pitrs several scions were born. Virajā (described as pitşkanyā in Vayu 93. 12 which Pargiter naively renders as father's daughter i. e. sister) is spoken of in the same Purāņa (Vāyu 73. 45 ) as the 'mind-born daughter' of these. ( i. e. of Pitrs ) in the plural and not as of the father'. Writers like Pargiter sometimes create more riddles by their so-called research than they can be said to have solved. 

The Padma asserts that those who please their married sisters with presents of clothes and the like are not subject to any quarrel for a year, nor to danger from enemies. Both Bhavisyottara and Padma state 'He who eats a meal prepared by his sister's hand on the day on which king Yama was served in this world a meal by Yamunā through affection secures wealth and the best of foods'. 

In Vedic times and in early smrtis like those of Manu (II. 11 ) and Yāj. (1.53 ) it was difficult for a brotherless maiden to get married (vide H. of Dh. vol. II p. 435). But from this it is a far cry to say that the Bhrātṛdyitiyā owes its origin to this idea or practice. 

CHAPTER XI 

Makarasankrānti and Mahasivarātri 

Makara-Sankrānti. This is a very important religious observance and festival. About 70 years ago (in the author's boyhood) it occurred on the 12th or 13th January according to the several Indian almanacs then cuğrent, but now it falls, owing to the procession of the equinoxes, on the 13th or the 14th of January in the month of Pausa. Sankranti means the (apparent) passage of the sun from one rāśi (sign of the Zodiac) to the next following' and hence the rāśi in which the Sun enters is designated as the Sankranti of that name. 540 When the Sun leaves the rāśi called Dhanus and enters the Makara rāśi that is called Makarasankranti. The rāśis are twelve and the Sankrānti names with their western equivalents are given in the note. 541 There are only twelve sankrāntis even if there be an intercalary month in some year. Everyone of the twelve sankrāntis was regarded as a holy day. The Matsya-purāņa (chap. 98 ) deals with the completion of Sankrānti-vrata. Briefly, it provides that on the day previous a person, whether male or female, should take food only once in the noon and on the Sankrānti day should brush his teeth and then take a bath with water mixed with sesamo 542 The person should offer to a self-restrained brāhmapa householder three vessels containing edibles together with a cow intending them to be for Yama, Rudra and Dharma and repeat four verses one of which is as follows: "As I do not make any difference between siva, Vişnu, the Sun and Brahmā, may Sankara (Siva ) who pervades

the Universe be always a bestower of welfare on mel'. 543 The person should make, if able, further gifts of ornaments, a bed stead and golden jars ( two) to the brāhmaṇa; but, if poor, should offer only fruits to the brāhmapa. Then he should take his meal but without oil and should feed others according to his ability. Women also should perform this yrata. Great merit was attached to a bath in the Ganges on a sankranti, on an eclipse and on New and Full moon, as such a man reached the world of Brahmā.544 A bath with ordinary water (not heated ) was obligatory (nitya ) on every sankranti, since the Devi purāņa declared : 545 “the man who would not take a bath on the holy day of Sankrānti would be for seven lives diseased and poor; whatever offerings are made to gods and pitrs by mon on sankranti are returned to them by the Sun again in several future lives ". 

. It may be stated that in ancient texts the entrance of the Sun alone in a rāśi is not regarded as holy time, but the entrance of all planets in a naksatra or rāśi was deemed to be a holy time. 546 Hemādri (on Kāla p. 437) and the Kālanirņaya (p. 345) quote three verses 547 specifying the holy times (punya kāla ) of the passage of the Sun and planets as follows: in the case of the Sun the punya-kāla is 16 ghatikās before and after the moment of the Sankranti; for the moon it is one ghati and thirteen palas on both sides, for Mars four ghatikās and one pala, for Mercury three ghatikās and 14 palas, for Jupiter 548 four

The twelve Sankrantis in the year are grouped into four classes, viz. there are two ayana sankrāntis (that is Makara - sankrānti from which udagayana starts and Karkata-sankrānti from which Daksiņāyana starts ), two Visuva sankrāntis (that is, Meşa and Tulā sankrāntis when the day and night are equal in length ), the four sankrāntis called Sadasīti or Sadasiti-mukha ( i. e. Mithuna, Kanya, Dhanus and Mina) and Visnupadi or Visnupada ( that is, Vrsabha, Simha, Vriscika and Kumbha) 550 

Sankrānti gradually came to be deified and the Devīpurāņa identified it with Durgā herself. The Devīpurāņa says " Devi is

all-pervading on account of the division into very small and large parts in the form of year, ayana, season, month, fortnight, day and the like. Devi bestows rewards in accordance with the divisions into meritorious and sinful ( actions).551 Even one act done at that time ( of Sankrānti) yields results multiplied crores of times. From dharma (righteous acts) increase life, kingdom, progeny, happiness and the like, from adharma (unrighteous conduct) spring diseases, sorrows and the like; whatever is donated and whatever japa is performed near (i. e, at the time of ) Visuva ( Mesa and Tula) sankrantis and at the ayana ( Makara and Karkata sankrāntis ) becomes inexhaustible; the same holds good about Vişnupada and Şadaśīti-mukha'. 

The exact moment of time when the sun leaves one rāśi and enters the next following rāśi is impossible of being marked by the eyes of flesh (ordinary human eyes). Therefore thirty ghatikās before and after the moment of Sankrānti are said to be the time. 552 

In order to convey how infinitesimally small is the time of the Sun's entrance into a rāśi after leaving another the Devi purana has 553 the following : “ thirtieth part of the time taken by the throb of the eye of a man sitting happily at ease is called * tatpara'; one hundredth part of 'tatpara' is called 'truti'; one hundredth part of truti' is the (duration of ) time of the sun's

passage ( from one rāśi into another ). As it is not possible to perform on such an infinitesimally small point of time the rites prescribed for performance on sankrānti, one has to accept periods of time near this moment as the proper time. The first rule is that the nearer554 the ghatikās are to the time of actual entrance the holier they are. Therefore it is laid down that in sankrantis the punyatama-kala (holiest time) is sevenfold sss viz. three, four, five, seven, eight, nine or twelve ghatikās%3B during those periods real merit is accumulated. If one cannot perform the prescribed rites within these limits thirty ghatikās are permitted as the highest limit in the texts for the punyakāla (holy time) for all sankrāntis except Şadaśīti ( in which the maximum punyakāla is 60 ghatikās) and Vişnupadi (where it 

is 16 ghatikās before and after ). 556 

Each of these twelve sankrāntis in the year is seven-fold (i. e. has seven different names) according as it occurs on a particular week day or in conjunction with certain classes of naksatras. The seven names 557 are : Manda, Mandakini, DhvanksI, Ghora, Mahodari, Raksasi, and Misrita. A sankranti (such as Mesa or Karka or Makara) is called Ghorā if it occurs on Sunday, Dhvānksi on Monday, Mahodari on Tuesday, Mandām kini on Wednesday, Mandā on Thursday, Misritā on Friday and Rākşasi on Saturday. Again, a sankrānti (like Meşa or Karka and so on) is called respectively Manda, Mandakini, Dhvanksi Ghorā, Mahodari, Rākşasi, Misritā according as it commences respectively on naksatras called dhruva, mrdu, ksipra, ugra,

cara, krūra, misrita. Vide note below 558 for the naksatras falling under these 7 groups. It is further provided that the ghatikās from two ( or three) to twelve said to be the holiest times (in note 555 above) are to be taken as respectively referring to the seven kinds of sankrānti i. e. two or three ghatikās is the holiest time in Mandā sankrānti, four ghatikās in Mandakini sankrānti and so on. It is laid down that Manda sankrānţi is beneficial to brāhmaṇas, Mandākini to kşatriyas, Dhvanksi to vaisyas, Ghora to Sudras, Mahodari to thieves, Rākşasī brings success to vendors of liquor and Misritā increases the ( profit of the) avocations of Candalas, Pukkasas, of those whose business is of a terrible nature and of all craftsmen ( vide Hemādri on Kāla pp. 409-410 and Varsakriya-kaumudi p. 210 quoting Devipurāpa ). 

There is some conflict on the question of the general rule about the extent of punyakala on a sankranti. Satatapa,559 Jābāla and Marici prescribe the sixteen ghatikās before and after the moment of Sankrānti as the pupyakāla for the perfor mance of the religious acts prescribed on Sankranti. On the other hand, the Devipurāņa 560 and Vasistha lay down fifteen ghatikās each before and after sankranti as the punyakāla. This conflict is removed in various ways. One is to hold that the Devīpurāna is not restrictive but what it means is only this that lesser limits are meant to indicate that greater merit results by 

558. The 27 or 28 नक्षत्रs are arranged in 7 groups as follows: ध्रुव (or स्थिर)-उत्तराफल्गुनी, उत्तराषाढा, उत्तराभाद्रपदा, रोहिणी; मृदु-अनुराधा, चित्रा, खेती, मृगशीर्ष, क्षिप्र (or लघु)-हस्त, अश्विनी, पुष्य, अभिजित्; उग्र-पूर्वाफल्गुनी, पूर्वाषाढा, पूर्वाभाद्रपदा, भरणी, मघा, चर--पुनर्वसु, श्रवण, धनिष्ठा, स्वाती, शतभिषक, कर (or तीक्ष्ण) मूल, ज्येष्ठा, आ, आश्लेषा, मिश्रित (or मृदुतीक्ष्ण or साधारण) कृत्तिका, विशाखा. Vide बृहत्संहिता 98.6-11 (Kern's ed.) for these lists and कृत्यकल्प (नेयत.) p. 361, है. on काल p. 409, का. नि. p. 341-342, स. म. p 137, बृहत्संहिता 98.9 and कृत्यकल्प० (नयत) do not mention अभिजित् among लघु group.

their observance. Another explanation was to hold that the limit of 16 ghatikās applied to sankrāntis called Visņupadi. 

A sankranti may take place by day or at night. If Sankrānti occurs by day that whole day is punyakāla. If Sankrānti occurs by night, lengthy and complicated discussions occur in Hemādri, Madhava and others. One rule evolved is that in ten sankrāntis excluding Makara and Karkata sankrantis the pupyakāla is by day when those sankrāntis occur by night. 

Several exceptions are engrafted on tbe general rule about 15 or 16 ghatikās before and after a sankrānti being the punyakāla. Therefore, several works like the Tithitattva (pp. 144-145 ) and Dharmasindhu (pp. 2–3) give brief final conclu sions on this topic. I summarize 560a the conclusions of the latter work. On the Sun's passage in Meşa and Tulā the punyakāla is fifteen ghatikās before and after S ( some say ten gbaţikās ); in Vrsabha, Simha, Vļścika, Kumbha S, P is sixteen gh. before S; in Mithuna S, Kanya, Dhanus and Mina S, P is 16 gh, after S; in Karkata S, P is thirty gh. after S; in Makara S, P is forty gh. after S. If Sankrānti occurs by day when a period of two ghatikās or less only remains before the close of the day then in the case of Mithuna, Kanyā, Dhanus, Mina and also Makara sankrāntis P is before $ for the gh. specified above against each; if S occurs in the morning at a period of two gh, or less from sunrise then in Vrsabha, Simha, Vğścika, Kumbha and also Karkata S, P is after S for the period specified above. If s occurs at night but before midnight, P is latter half of the day time before the S; if S occurs at midnight or later than midnight but in the night, P is on two days viz. the latter half of the daytime before S and the first half of the day after S; this applies to all S except Makara and Karkata. When Uttarāyana begins in Makara in the night P is the day after S and if S begins in Karkata at night P is the day prior; if Makara S occurs at evening twilight (i. e. during three ghatikās after sunset ) then P is on the previous day; if Karka S occurs in morning twilight (i. e. during three gh, before sunrise ) then P 

is on the day following the S. 

This discussion about the punyakāla is necessary because a bath is to be taken and gifts are to be made during that time in order to secure the full merit thereof. The general rule is that a 

560 a. In this summary S, stands for Sankranti or Sankrāotis, gb. for gbaţikās, P. for punyakāla.

bath is not to be taken and a gift is not to be made at night. Parāśara 561 says 'a bath by day purified by the rays of the Sun is commended; bathing at night is not commended except on seeing an eclipse'. The Vişnudharmasutra says the same. But several exceptions were recognized. The Bhavisyapurāņa 562 provides one should not take a bath at night and particularly should not make a gift at night, but a bath and a gift may be made at night on proper occasions. A gift at night is commended in an eclipse, marriage, sankrānti, pilgrimage, on death, on the birth of a child and at (before sitting down for) hearing itihāsa (Mahābhārata)'. Gobhila563 provides 'people may bathe and make gifts at night in eclipses, sankrāntis, marriage, in distress (or death) and on the birth of a child and in yratas undertaken for a desired object'. A bath is therefore obligatory on every sankrānti and particularly in Makara-sankrānti. There are special recommendations about gifts in Hemādri on Kāla (pp. 414-419 ) which are taken by him from Viśvāmitra and which are borrowed by Nirnayasindhu (pp. 4-5), Samaya mayūkha (pp. 143-144) and others and which are as follows: gift of ram on Mesa, of cows on Vrşabha, of clothes, food and drinks on Mithuna, of ghrtadhenu561 on Karkata, of a conveyance with some gold on Simha, of clothes and cows on Kanyā, of different kinds of grains and seeds on Tula, on Vrācika of clothes and houses, on Dhanus of clothes and conveyances, on Makara

of wood and fire, on Kumbha of cows, water and grass, on Mina of fresh flowers. Special gifts are required to be made on Makarasankrānti. The Skanda 565 says "He who donates tila dhenu on Uttarāyana (i. e. Makarasankrānti) secures all objects and obtains the highest happiness.' The Vişnudharmottara provides the gift of garments on Uttarāyaṇa yields great reward (merit). A man becomes free from diseases by donating sesame and a draught bull'. The Sivarahasya declares that Siva after he performed the Gosava sacrifice created sesame on Makara-sankrānti for the gratification of all men and provides 'men should bathe in water in which sesame are mixed and one should rub one's body with sesame; tarpaņa of gods and pitrs should be made with water in which sesame have been put; sesame should be given to brāhmaṇas on Uttarāyana sankrānti; one should eat sesame and perform homa with them; those who perform homa with sesame and honour brāhmaṇas shine in the heaven (as stars) like those who donate a thousand cows; auspicious lamps fed with oil of sesame should be lighted in Siva temples and a brāhmaṇa should worship God (Śiva ) with grains of rice and sesame'. The Kālikā-purāņa (q. by Hemādri on Kāla p. 413 and Kṛtyakalpao, Naiyata, pp. 366-67) provides : *one should place on the top of the linga emblem of) God (Siya) the five jewels viz. gold, diamond, sapphire, ruby and pearl; but if a man has none of these he may place in Uttarāyaṇa on the top of the linga gold one 566 karşa or half karsa in weight; he should worship with plenty of ghee prepared from cow's milk and should donate gheo and a blanket after washing and pressing it; he should give condiments and a dinner to brāhmaṇag and ascetics and honour them with daksiņā'.

A person should also observe a fast for three days or one day in honour of Makara-sankranti 567. A man who fasts for three days and after a bath offers worship to the Sun on ayana (i.e. start of Sun's apparent passage to the north or south), on Visuya day and on the eclipse of the sun or the moon secures the fulfilment of all his desires'. Apastamba says 'A man who after a bath fasts the whole day on ayana, Vişuva and an eclipse of the sun or moon becomes free from all sins. But a house holder that has a son living was not to observe a fast on a Sunday, on sankranti and on the Sun's and Moon's eclipse'. 

The great merit collected by gifts on sankrāntis is set forth by the Rajamārtanda568 in two verses 'The reward ( of gifts) on ayana-sankrānti is a crore of times ( as much as of the same gift on an ordinary day) and on Vişnupadi a hundred thousand times; it is declared to be 86000 times on Sadasiti. Gift on the eclipse of the moon is a hundredfold ( in merit) and a thousand fold on sun's eclipse, one hundred thousand times on Visuva days, and of endless duration on the Full Moon days of Āsādha, Kārtika, Māgha and Vaišākha. The Bhavisya highly praises a bath in the Ganges on ayana and Vişuva sankrāntis. 'He who bathes in the waters of the Ganges on ayana and Vişuva secures the fruit of bathing in the Ganges for half a year'. Vide Vi. Dh. III. 319. 38-45 about the gifts to be made on the several sankrāntis and the rewards of such gifts (q. by Dāna-sāgara pp. 646-647) and C. I. I. vol. IV.

Śrāddha on sāňkrānti 

221 

Some prescribe that śrāddha should be performed on Sankrānti. The Visnudharmasūtra 569 provides : 'the passage of the sun (from one rāśi into another), the two Vişuya days, and specially the ayana days, Vyatīpāta (yoga), the naksatra of one's birth and auspicious occasions (such as a marriage, birth of a son); Prajāpati declares that these are times for śrāddha that are kāmya (i. e. they fulfil the desires one may entertain and are optional); śrāddha performed on these days tends to produce inexhaustible gratification (to the pitps )'. Here again there was conflict. Sūlapāņi held that the śrāddha on sankranti included pindadāna while the Nirnayasindhu (p. 6) holds that the śrāddha should be of the pārvaņa type but without pindas. Just as some acts such as a bath, fast and gifts were specially commended, so certain acts were forbidden on the days of sankrāntis. The Visnupurāņa 570 provides : The 14th tithi, 8th tithi, amāvāsyā and pārņimā and the Sun's passage ( from one rāśi to another ), these are called parvan. The man who has sexual intercourse and partakes of oil and flesh on these parvan days goes to a hell called 'Viņmūtra-bhojana' (where the food is excreta and urine ). The Brahmapurāņa 571 also says 'one should give up sexual intercourse, oil and meat on the 8th tithi, the last tithis of the two fortnights, on the day of the sun's sankrānti and on the penultimate day (14th tithi) in each pakşa (half of a month)'. 

Hemādri ( on Vrata, vol. II. pp. 727-743) mentions fifteen sankrānti vratas such as the Sujanmāvāpti-vrata from Vişņu dharmottara, Devipurāna and Skandapurāņa, which would be mentioned in the list of vratas added later on, 

In modern times Makarasankrānti is more a social festival than a religious one. No fast is observed and hardly anyone performs śrāddha, though many people bathe in the sea or in tirthas like the Ganges at Prayaga and elsewhere. Sesame are very much in evidence, particularly in the Deccan and people

greet each other by giving articles from simpls sesame and jaggery to artistic sugared preparations of sesame coloured with saffron and go about saying 'take these sesame and jaggery and speak sweet words' (in Marathi). 

The importance of tilas (sesame) is brought out in the following: A person 572 who uses sesame in six ways does not sink (is not unsuccessful or unlucky) i. e. who rubs his body with sesame, who bathes with sesame, who is pure and always offers water mixed with sesame (to his deceased ancestors), and who offers sesame into fire, who makes a gift of sesame and who eats sesame. 

Gifts are made in these days on Makarasankrānti, but mostly by women. They honour priests by donating vessels (of clay, copper or brass) containing several things such as betelnuts and coins and also invite their women friends and distribute among them earthen vessels containing red powder, pieces of turmeric, betelnut and also separately several other things such as sugarcane stalks. In south India there is a festival called Pongal 573 which corresponds with the Makara sankrānti observed in Northern and Western India, Pongal being the first day of the Tamil year. This South Indian festival lasts for three days. 

According to the modern astronomical calculations, the winter solstice occurs on 21st December and on that day com mences the Sun's apparent march towards the north. But in India people who follow the almanacs based on the ancient methods and data think that the Sun's march towards the north takes place on the 14th of January. They are thus about twenty three days behind the correct Makarasankrānti owing to the precesion of the equinoxes. This fact was recognized even in tike medieval Dharmaśāstra works. For example, Homādri 574

says that twelve days before the (popular) day of a sankrānti, the real punyakāla occurs and therefore gifts and the like prescribed on the occasion of sankrānti should also be performed on the day twelve days prior to the popular sankrānti day. 

The origin of the observances of Makarasankrānti cannot be very ancient. The Sun's apparent northward march for six months has been mentioned in Brāhmaṇa and Upanisad texts at least a thousand years before Christ. For example, the Sata patha 575 Br. states That half moon which increases represents the gods and that which decreases represents the fathers. The day represents the gods and the night represents the fathers. And further, the forenoon represents the gods and the afternoon the fathers. ...Now when he (the sun) moves northwards then he is among the gods, then he guards the gods; and when he moves southwards then he is among the fathers, then he guards the fathers.' The Chandogya-Upanisad 576 contains a reference to the Sun's passage to the north during six months in the words 'from light to day, from day to the bright half of the month, from the bright half of the month to the six months during which the sun goes towards the north, from the months to the year, from the year to the Sun &c.' But here the word udag-ayana is not expressly employed. The word 'ayana' occurs in the Rgveda III 33.7 (āyannāpo ayanam-icchamānāḥ) 'the waters seeking a pass age went rushing.' Here 'ayana' has the etymological sense of 

passage' or 'place.' But in the grhyasūtras the word 'udaga yana' in the sense of the sun's northward passage occurs. The

But those words as quoted by N. S. from Aparārka are not found in the printed Aparārka at p. 426 (Anandāsrama ed.).

History of Dharmaśāstra 

(Sec. 1, Ch. XI 

Āśvalāyana-grhya 571 prescribes the auspicious times for certain domestic rites as follows: 'in the northward passage of the sun, in the bright half of a month and on an auspicious nakşatra, caula ( child's tonsure ), upanayana, godāna and marriage may be celebrated; according to some teachers a marriage may be celebrated at all times ( not necessarily in northward passage of the sun &c.)'. But here no rāśi name appears. In Jaimini VI. 8. 23 it is provided that rites for gods are to be performed in the northward passage of the Sun, some day in the bright half of the month and on an auspicious day. As a matter of fact, none of the ancient Srauta, Gșhya or Dharmasūtras mentions any rāśis or prescribes any auspicious or inauspicious times concerned with rāśis but only times in relation to naksatras. Some people try to interpret the words 'susthe indau' (when the moon is well placed i. e. auspicious) in Yaj. I. 80 as referring to rāśis, but they forget or ignore the fact that the earliest extant com mentator of Yājñavalkya, Viśvarūpa, explains those words as referring to naksatras and not to rāśis. The subject about the introduction of rāśis will be briefly discussed in the next section on Kāla and Muhūrta. As udagayana had already been regarded for many centuries as an auspicious period, naturally Makarasankrānti from which the northward passage of the Sun starts became a very sacred day, when the rāśi system was introduced. Why so much importance was attached to sesame on this Makarasankrānti day it is difficult to say. Probably in view of the cold prevailing at the time of the beginning of uttarāyana an oily substance like sesame easily available and of great food value was selected. In any case the observances and festival of Makarasankrānti do not appear to be much older than the beginning of the Christian era. 

In modern pañcāngas, Makarasankranti, being deemed to be a deity, several curious matters are added, viz. sankranti rides on some vāhana (principal vehicle or draught animal such as an elephant) and an upavāhana ( as ancillary vehicle ), she wears a garment either dark, white or red or of some other colour, she is supposed to carry a weapon (such as a bow or javelin),

she applies a tilaka of some substance (like lac, gorocana), she is either young, middle-aged or old, her posture ( sitting, standing &c. ) is mentioned, the flower she holds, the food she eats, the ornament she wears-these are mentioned, her two names out of the seven mentioned above on p. 215 note 557 based on the week day and the naksatra on which sankranti takes place) are specified, she is supposed to come from one direction (east or the like), to proceed to another ( such as the west &c.) and to cast a glance at a third direction; then her bodily form is described such as drooping lips, long nose, with nine arms (or the like). And the prognostications are as follows: whatever things Sankranti accepts, their prices rise or they are destroyed and whatever she glances at is ruined; happy are the people in the direction from which she comes and un happy are those in the direction she goes. 

Mahāśivarātri: The 14th tithi of the dark half of a month is called Sivarātri, but the 14th of the dark half in Māgha (or in Phālguna according to the pūrnimānta reckoning) is the siya rātri par excellence and is often designated Mahāśivarātri. 

The Garudapurāna I. 124, Skanda I. 1.33, Padma VI. 240, Agni 193 contain the Māhātmya of the Sivarātri on the 14th of the dark half of Māgha. Though some details differ, in all these the main outlines are the same. 

All these praise Śivarātri-vrata highly. When after 578 observing a fast on that day, Siva is worshipped with bilva leaves and jūgara for the whole night is observed, Siva saves the man from hell and bestows enjoyment of happiness and moksa and the man becomes like Siva himself. Gifts, sacrifices, austerities, pilgrimages and observances of vratas are not equal to even one ten-millionth part of Sivarātri. 

The story that illustrates this extremely exaggerated praise of Sivarātri in the Garudapurāņa seems to be the older of the three and therefore it is briefly set out here. There was a king of nişādas named Sundarasenaka on Mount Abu, who went out

to a forest for hunting with his dog. He bagged no animal and bejng oppressed by hunger and thirst he remained awake the whole night on the bank of a tank in a thicket of trees. Under. neath a bilva tree there was a Sivalinga and in an effort to keen his body at ease he throw down loaves of the bilva tree which 

fell on the top of the linga without his knowing it. In order to put down dust he (took water from the tank and) splashed it so that it fell on the linga and one of his arrows fell down from his hands on the linga through inadvertence which he took from the linga by falling on his knees before the linga. In this way he unconsciously bathed the linga, touched it, worshipped it (with bilva leaves) and kept awake the whole night. In the morning he came back to his house and partook of food given by his wife. When he died in course of time he was seized by the myrmidons of Yama, when Siva's attendants fought with them and liberated him and he became a sinless attendant of Śiva together with his dog. In this way he collected merit without knowing it; if a person does with 579 full knowledge '( what the nisāda did without knowing ) the merit is inexhaus tible. The Agnipurāpa expressly mentions the hunter Sundara senaka 580. The whole chapter of Garuda is quoted in the Varşakriyā-kaumudi pp. 512-513. The story in the Skanda is more elaborate. There it is a wicked Kirāta named Canda who killed fish by catching them in his nets and killed also many animals and birds. He had a wife who matched him in his cruelty. Thus passed many years. One day he ascended a bilva tree taking water in a quiver desirous of killing a wild boar and passed the whole night without sleep keeping a watch and cast down many bilva leaves which fell on a linga at the bottom of the bilva tree. He also rinsed his mouth with water from the quiver, that fell on the linga. In this way he worshipped Siva in all ways, viz. he bathed (snapana) the linga with water, he worshipped linga with numberless bilva leaves and he kept awake the whole night and was without food that day. He alighted from the tree and began, after reaching the tank, to catch fish. Because he did not return home that night, his wife went without food and water and passed that night in anxiety. In the morning she came to that forest with some food for her husband and seeing her husband on the other side of a river, she placed the food on the river bank and began to

cross the river. They both bathed in the river, but before the kirāta could reach the food a dog came there and ate all the food. When the wife wanted to kill the dog the kirāta whose heart was softened porsuaded his wife to desist from killing the dog. By that time it was noon (on amāvāsyā) and Siva's attendants came there to take both the husband and wife as he had worshipped ( though unknowingly ) the linga and as both had fasted on 14th. The kirāta and his wife reached Sivaloka The Padmapurāņa (VI. 240. 32 ff) weaves, as the Skanda does, its story round a nişāda. 

There is a conflict of views about what the chief thing is in Sivarātri is. The Tithitattva holds that a fast is the principal thing in Sivaratri and relies on the words of Sankara. "On that tithi ( Sivarātri) I am not so pleased with bath (of the linga) not with clothes (offered to the linga) nor with incense nor by worship nor with the offering of flowers as I am pleased by a fast'581 On the other hand, Hemādri and Madhava hold that Sivarātri means fast, worship and jāgarana 582 and all the three are apprehended as principal and quote passages from the Skandapurāṇa and Nāgarakhanda in support.583 *That man who observes a fast on Sivaratri for twelve years and who keeps awake ( in dance and music ) before me the whole night would reach heaven. That man, who worships Siva and performs jāgara on the 14th, would not thereafter taste milk at mother's breast (i. e. would not be born again); the nişāda, unknowingly worshipping a self-existent linga, observing a fast and jāgara, became free from sin and attained the position of the attendant of Siva'.

History of Dharmaśāstra 

(Sec. I, Ch. XI 

In the Kālanirņaya 584 there is a lengthy discussion on the question whether the word 'Sivarātri' is used in a conventional sense ( viz. a particular tithi) or in an etymological sense (every night on which some observance relating to Siva is performed), or a metaphorical sense (viz. a vrata, though the word expresses a tithi) or a yogarūdha sense i. 8. etymological cum conventional like the word pankaja ( a lotus). The conclusion established is that the word Sivarātri is yogarūdha like the word pankaja ( lotus), which does spring from mud (so far the sense is etymological) but which is confined to only one thing viz. lotus (so far there is rūdhi or convention) and does not apply to a frog. 

Śivarātrivrata is both nitya (obligatory ) and kūnya (optional). It is nitya because there are passages which lay down that sin follows if a man does not perform it 585; the being that does not worship with devotion Rudra who is the lord of three worlds wanders through thousands of future lives. Besides, there are verses which lay down that the vrata should be per formed every586 year: 'O great goddess! a man and a chaste woman should every year worship Mahādeva with devotion on Siyarātri'. This vrata is optional because the texts provide the rewards of performing this vrata. For example, vide p. 85 above and p. 86 above for the maxim of sanyoga-prthaktva. 

This vrata according to the Isanasamhita 587 can be per formed by all human beings. "The Sivarātrivrata destroys all

ging and confers enjoyment of happiness and mokşa (final liberation ) on all human beings including cāņdālas'. 

The Īsānasamhitā provides: a devotee of Visņu or Siva or of another god, if he gives up Sivarātri, destroys all the fruits of his worship ( of the deity to whom he is devoted). Everyone588 who performs this vrata has to observe certain restrictions, viz. non-injury, truthfulness, freedom from anger, celibacy, compas sion, forbearance and he has to be calm in mind, devoid of fits of passion and has to perform austerities and he should be free from malice; knowledge of this vrata should be imparted to such a one provided he follows his preceptor; if one imparts it other wise, one goes to hell. 

The proper time for this vrata is night, since, as stated in the Skanda 589 'goblins, the Saktis and Siya (who wields the trident) move about at night and therefore these are to be worshipped at that time on caturdasi.' The Skanda 590 provides 'A fast should be observed on that caturdaši of the dark half that is joined to nišitha (i. e. that exists at that time); that tithi is the best and leads to companionship with Siva'. Hemādri quotes Nāgarakhanda 591 as follows: on the 14th of the dark half of Māgha I shall go in the Kaliyuga on the surface of the earth at night and not by day. I shall undoubtedly transfer myself to all lingas, whether movable or permanently fixed, for the removal of the sins committed in the (preceding ) year; therefore the man who offers worship to me at night with these mantras will be free from sin'. In the Išānasamhitā it is said *The first God (Siva ) appeared in the form of Sivalinga, whose refulgence was equal to that of a crore of suns, on the 14th of Māgha dark half.

A man should perform this vrata on that tithi when the 14th covers the time before and after midnight.' 592 Hemādri also quotes a verse like this 'The 14th tithi called Sivarātri that covers pradosa should be accepted (for vrata); one should observe a fast on that tithi since there has to be a jāgara (in that vrata) at night.'593 

Owing to the above somewhat conflicting dicta there is a great deal of discussion on the proper day and time for the vrata in Hemādri on Kāla (pp. 298–308), Kālanirņaya (pp. 297 ff). Tithitattva (pp. 125-126), Nirnayasindhu (pp. 222-224), Puruşārthacintāmaņi (pp. 248–253) and other works. Some works like the Nirnayāmṛta 594 put emphasis on the word pradosa (in note 593) above, while others emphasize the word nišitha and ardharātra. The conclusions drawn by Mādhava (the prince of nirnayakāras) are stated here. If caturdaśl covers both pradosa and nišitha, then the vrata should be observed on that day. If caturdaśī spreads over two days (i.e. it is mixed with 13th and also with amāvāsya) and 14th exists at the time of niśitha on both days, or if it does not so exist on any of the two days, then covering pradosa is the determining factor; where 14th covers pradosa on two days or does not cover pradosa on any of the two days, then existing at nisitha is the determin ing factor; if caturdaši having extended over two days covers only one out of the two (pradosa and niśitha) on each day then conjunction with Jayā (i. e. 13th tithi) is the decisive factor.595 

A brief description of how Śivarātrivrata was performed in ancient times may be gathered from Garudapurāna I. 124. 11-23. After honouring Siva on the 13th tithi the man who is to under take the vrata should resolve to observe certain restrictions. He should declare 'O God I shall keep awake the whole night on the

14th tithi. I shall make according to my ability worship, gifts, austerities and homa. O Sambhul on 14th I shall take no food and shall take food on the next day. Oh Lord! be thou my refuge for securing enjoyment of happiness and moksa. The person observing the vrata should approach a teacher and should bathe (the linga) with pañcagarya and with pañcamrta. He should repeat the mantra 'Om namah Sivāya.' He should worship Siva with the upacāras beginning with sandalwood paste and he should offer into fire sesame, grains of rice and boiled rice mixed with ghee. After this homa he should offer pārnāhuti (an offering made with a full ladle) and listen to music and good stories (about Siva). He should again offer offerings at midnight, in the 3rd quarter of the night and in the 4th quarter. Having inaudibly repeated the mūlamantra (om namah Sivāya) he should pray to Siva about daybreak to forgive his sins with the words 'O God! I have worshipped in this vrata without obstacles through your favour; O Lord of the worlds i O Sival pardon me. Whatever merit I have won this day and whatever has been offered by me to Siva I have finished this vrata to-day through your favour; O bountiful onel be pleased with me, and go to your abode; there is no doubt that I have become pure by merely seeing you.' He should seed persons who are devoted to contemplating (on Siva) and should give to them garments, umbrellas and the like; 'O Lord of Gods! lord of all things! that bestoweth favour on people; may my lord be gratified by what I have given with faith.' Having thus prayed for forgiveness, the person undertaking this vrata may carry it on for twelve years. After obtaining fame, wealth, sons and kingdom he may repair to the city of Siya; he should perform jāgara (on 14th) in all the 12 months of the year; the man undertaking the vrata after feeding twelve brāhmaṇas and donating lamps may secure heaven. 

The Tithitattva (p. 127) adds some details which are interesting. The linga is to be bathed with milk in the first watch of the night, with curds in the 2nd, with ghee in the 3rd and with honey in the 4th. The mantras in the four watches are respectively 'hrim, Išānāya namaḥ,' hrim Agho rāya namah,''hrim Vāmadevāya namaḥ' and 'hrim Sadyojātaya namaḥ.' The mantra at the time of offering arghya is also different in each of the four watches. It is further provided that there should be songs and dances in the first watch of the 

232

(Sec. I, Ch. XI 

night. The Varsakriyākaumudi (p. 513) provides that in the 2nd, 3rd and 4th watches also the person undergoing vrata has to perform worship, arghya, japa and listening to stories (about Siya), to offer hymns of praise and make prostrations and at day-break he should pray for forgiveness with arghya water, If Māgha-kļšņa 14th falls on a Sunday or Tuesday, that is most commendable for this vrata.5% 

Later medieval digests such as the Tithitattva (pp. 126 ff), the Kālatattvavivecana (pp. 197–203), Purusārthacintamani (pp. 255-258 ), Dharmasindhu (p. 127 ) provide an elaborate description of the procedure of Sivarātri vrata. The K. T. V, remarks 597 that the procedure of Sivarātri-vrata is different in the several purānas. For comparison with the one in the Garuda quoted above a summary of it from the Dharmasindhu is given here. On the 13th tithi the performer should take only one meal in the noon, on the 14th after finishing his usual morning duties and rites, he should make a sankalpa in the morning with a mantra 'I shall perform this Śivarātrivrata that yields great rewards; O Lord of the world I may it be without obstacles through your favour. On the 14th I shall be without food and shall tako my meal on the next day for enjoyment of pleasures and mokşa, O Lord I be you my refuge.' If the per former be a brāhmaṇa, he should recite the two ?k verses598 'rātrim prapadye' and cast water. In the evening (of 14th ) he should take a bath with black sesame, should apply the tripundra mark 599 with ashes to his forehead and also hold a rosary of rudrākşa ( berry of Elaeocarpus Ganitrus), should go to a temple of Siva at the beginning of night, should wash his feet, should take ācamana (should sip water) and should make a sankalpa 'I shall perform the pūjā of the first watch on Sivaratri'; if he intends to perform separate pūjās on all the four watches or if he wants to perform a pūjā only once he should say 'I shall perform the worship of Siva on Siyarātri for securing the favour of Siva.' Then he should repeat the sage (Vāmadeva)

of the Śiva mantra of five letters (Śivāya namah), the metre (Anusțup ), the Devatā ( Sadāśiva) and it is to be employed for nyāsa, pūjā and japa. Then he should bow to the sage, metre and Sadāśiva and perform nyāsa on the several parts of the body from the heart with appropriate mystic letters and mantras (such as 'om namas-tat-puruṣāya namaḥ hrdaye' to the last 'om yam astrāya phat); then he should worship the jar ( kalasa ) and contemplate on Siva as portrayed 600 in the verse quoted below. He should then establish a linga by performing the prāņa pratisthā and touch it and should invoke 601 Siva with four mantras and pray Siva to be present in the linga till the end of the pūjā. Then he should offer an anjali of flowers. If the linga is already permanently fixed or if the linga, though not fixed, has already been established with the necessary samskāras, he should omit the details from prāņapratisthā to āvāhana, Then he should perform the remaining upacāras (out of 16 ) from āsana to the last. As regarde snāna it is provided that the linga is to be bathed with pañcāmṛta ( vide note 218 ), with the mūlamantra (Sivāya namaḥ ) and the mantras apyāyasva' 

(Rg. I. 91. 16 ff) and should wash it with pure water with - the three verses 'āpo hi sthā' (Rg. X. 9. 1-3). Then he should perform abhiseka (bathing of the deity ) with water made fragrant with sandalwood, saffron and camphor to the accom paniment of the Rudra mantras602 recited once or repeated eleven times and of the Purusasūkta ( Rg. X. 90). At the end of snāna ( of the linga ) the performer should give ācamana water ( to the linga ) and perform tarpaņa with water mixed with aksatas for Siva with eight names (Bhava 603 &c.) and the wives of these eight. After flowers the performer should offer 1008 or 108

* If caturdaśī tithi ends before three watches of the night end, then the pāraṇā should be at the erd of the (14th ) tithi: if caturdaśī ( tithi) extends beyond the three watches of the night, then at daybreak the pāraṇā takes place in the midst of the 14th; these are the views of Mādhava and others; the opinion of the Nirnayasindhu is that even when the caturdaši tithi ends before the three watches of the night the pāraņā must be observed in the midst of the caturdaśī and not at the end of caturdaśī. 

In modern times very few, if at all, go through the prc cedure prescribed even in the Dharmasindhu. A fast is observed and Siva is worshipped and people may listen to stories of Siva's exploits. Common people in some parts drink a beverage called bhāng prepared by pouring water on crushed hemp leaves with the addition of almonds, rose leaves, opium seeds &c. It is supposed to be dear to Sankara. In many temples of Siva, water is made to drip on the linga incessantly. 

Mr. Gupte (pp. 208–215 ) after detailing the story of a hunter and a doe, her mate buck and two young ones connects the Sivarātri observances with the constellation of Mrgaśirsa together with Sirius (the Hunter), but he is at a loss to explain why the 14th of Māgha-krsna should have been selected for a fast. Mr. Mukerji (pp. 33-37 ) contents himself by referring to the Sivarātrimāhātmya in Santiparva. The constellation of Mrgasirsa and the brightest star Sirius had attracted the minds of ancient Indians. The Ait. Br. (XIII, 9 )608 narrates how Prajapati seeking his own daughter for intercourse sinned, how he assumed the form of an antelope and how the gods brought together their terrible forms, which became Rudra whom they asked to pierce the antelope. When Rudra pierced the antelope, the latter fled up into the sky. People call it Mļga ( Mrgaśīrşa ) and Rudra became the hunter ( Mrgavyādha), the daughter became Rohiņi and the arrow (with its three parts ) became the three arrow-like stars. 

In the Lingapurāņa as quoted in the Vratarāja ( pp. 573– 586 ) there is the story of a hunter (nisāda ) who when bent on killing a doe, her mate and children unknowingly performed all the characteristic actions of Sivarātrivrata and

CHAPTER XII 

Holikā and Grahaņa (eclipse) 

Holika. Holi or Holikā is a festival of unmixed gaiety and frolics throughout India, though all parts do not observe it in the same way. One element, viz. bonfire, is present almost everywhere except in Bengal. Swinging of Krsna image on Phālguna Full Moon is done in Bengal, but it is not observed in several other parts of India. The number of days during which this festival is observed also varies from province to province. Another item which is common to many parts of India is the sprinkling of friends with coloured water from bamboo or metal syringes or with red powder and this merriment is indulged in even now by persons in high places. In the Konkan men dressed as women accompanied by several persons go about with songs (often obscene) and music and dance. The only religious element is the worship of Krsna in Bengal and in some provinces where bonfires are made a priest is engaged to perform pūjā before the bonfire, people go round the fire throwing cocoanuts in the burning wood and grass, taking them out half-burnt and distributing the singed kernel among the people present as prasāda. In some parts people produce sounds by beating their mouths with the backs of their hands. It is not possible nor necessary to set out in this notice all the varying details of this festival throughout the whole of India. 

This festival is very ancient. Originally the form of the word was Holākā and from references in the bhāsya of Sabara on the Pūrvamlmāmgā-sūtra (1. 3. 15-23 ) 610 it appears that it was in ancient times & usage very prevalent in the eastern parts of Bhārata. But Jaimini and Sabara appear to hold that

238

[ Sec. I, Ch. XII 

Holākā should be observed by all Aryas. In the Kathakagrhya 73.1 there 611 is the sūtra 'Rākā Holāke' which is explained by the commentator Devapāla as follows ‘Holā is a special rite performed for the saubhūgya of women and in that rite Rākā ( Full Moon ) is the deity'. Other commentators interpret it differently. Among the twenty kridas found in the whole of Bhārata and also restricted to certain provinces only and mentioned by Vātsyāyana in his Kāmasūtra 612 ( 1. 4. 42 ) is Holākā which is explained by the commentary Jayamangalā as comprising the sprinkling of each other by people on Phālguna Full Moon with coloured water discharged from a horn or the like and throwing perfumed powder. Hemādri on Kāla (p. 106 ) quotes a verse from Brhadyama 613 in which Holikā-pūrnimā is called 'Hutāśanī' (as in modern times ). Hemādri further quotes a verse from Lingapurāna 614 "the Phālguna Full-moon day is said to be known as “Phālgunikā', as full of boyish pranks and tonding to the prosperity of people" and another verse from Varāhapurāna where it is qualified as 'patavāsavilāsini' (i. e, containing pranks with powder). Hemādri ( on vrata, II. 184–190 ) quotes a long passage from the Bhav. U. (chap. 132. 1-51 ) in which Yudhisthira is represented as asking Krsna why in each village and town a festival is held on Phā. Full moon, why boys become boisterous in each house and kindle Holākā, what god is worshipped therein, who introduced the festival and what is done therein and why it is called 'Adādā.' Krsna tells him a legend about king Raghu whom the citizens approached with the complaint that a certain rāksasi (ogress)

called Dhondhā troubled boys by day and night. The king consulted his purohita who told him that she was a rāksasi, daughter of Mālin, who got from Siva a boon that she would not be liable to be killed by gods or men nor suffer from arms nor from cold, heat or rain. The priest further told the king that Siva said that she would be in danger from boys going about crazily. The priest added that on Phālguna 15th season of cold vanishes and summer starts, that people may laugh and enjoy themselves, that boys with bits of wood in their hands may go out of houses in great glee, collect a heap of wood and grass, set it on fire with Rāksoghna inantras, clap their hands, go round the fire thrice, laugh, sing and utter obscene words in the popular language and by that noise and loud peals of laughter on the part of boys and by the homa 615 the ogress would die. When the king got all this done, the rāksasi expired and the day came to be called 'Adādā' and Holikā. Then it is further stated that on the next day which is the first tithi of the month of Caitra (on the pūrnimānta reckoning) people should salute the ashes of the bonfire with the mantra quoted below,616 then worship of Kāma should be made on a square in the house yard in the midst of which square a seat should be arranged and in front a jar covered with leaves containing aksatas and smeared with white sandalwood paste should be placed. The image of Kāma should have sandalwood paste applied to it by a beautiful woman and thereafter the priest should make the performer partake of mango blossoms mixed with sandalwood paste. Then donations should be made to learned brāhmaṇas, bards &c. according to one's ability with the words. May the God of Love be pleased with me.' The purāņa winds up with the verse 'When the season of frost ends on the 15th of the bright half and the time of spring approaches in the morning, that man who partakes of mango blossoms with sandal 

wood paste lives in happiness.' 

Instead of the gay and saturnalia-like practices prevalent in many parts of India about Holikā, Bengal celebrates it by the Dolayātrā. Sūlapāņi composed thereon a short work called

Dolayātrā-viveka.617 The festival should be carried on for five or three days. Before the Full moon of Phālguna, on the 14th at the beginning of night an utsava in honour of Agni is to be celebrated to the east of the mandapa. Then an image of Govinda is to be made, it is established in a structure with 16 pillars on a vedikā (raised platform) and it is to be bathed with pañcāmsta and various items of worship are to be offered and seven times the swing on which the image is placed has to be rocked to and fro. Fire kindled on the first day is to be preserved till the days of the festival end. At the end the swing is to be rocked 21 times. It is narrated that king Indradyumna started this swing festival in Vṛndāvana. By means of this utsava a man becomes free from all sins. Then Sūlapāņi discusses at some length the exact tithi, prahara and naksatra on which the Dolayātrā is to be performed. Briefly, the conclusion is that Dolayātrā must be performed when the Full Moon tithi is runn ing, whether there is Uttarā-phalgunl-naksatra or not.618 

The Kālatattvaviyecana very succinctly puts down the characteristics of Holikotsava as set forth in the Bhavisyottara.619 The Nirnayasindhu (227), Smrti-kaustubha (516-519), Purus ārtha-cintāmaņi (308-319) and other late medieval works dis course on this festival, but for reasons of space their discussions are not set out here. 

As Holākā is mentioned by Jaimini and the Kāthakagshya, it follows that it prevailed at least some centuries before Christ. The Kāmasūtra and Bhavisyottara connect it with spring and it was performed at the end of the year (on pūrnimānta reckoning). Therefore, the bonfire represents the expiry of the season of frost and cold and heralds the warmth and love-making of spring.

water and powder is an additional item in the celebration of the delights of spring. In some provinces this sprinkling is done on the very day of the Holikā, while in the Deccan it is indulged in on the 5th day (popularly called Ranga-pañcami) after Holikā bonfire. Though the Holikā festival is composite in several parts of India and is celebrated on more days than one, in origin it is no more than a spring festival. In some parts mud is 620 thrown by people at each other on the day after bonfire. That is probably an extension of the idea of applying ashes of the bon fire to one's forehead and the body on the day after it. The usage in some parts of creating noise by striking the back of one's hand against one's mouth accompanied by an obscene reference to sex is a further perversion due to welcoming the advent of spring which is traditionally the season of love-mak ing. Mr. Gupte in 'Hindu holidays and ceremonies' tries hard to show that the Holikā festival was 'imported from Egypt or Greece' (p. 92). This theory is very fantastic and does not deserve to be taken seriously. He had not read, it appears, the ancient works mentioned above and is not himself sure whether the origin is to be found in Egypt or in Greece. 

Grahaņa (eclipse, solar and lunar). Great importance was attached from very ancient times to eclipses. An extensivo literature has accumulated on this subject. Vide among others Hemādri on Kāla 379-394, Kālaviveka 521-543, Krtyaratnākara 625-631, Kālanirnaya 346-358, Varsakriyākaumudi 90–117, Tithitattva 150-162, Křtyatattva 432-434, Nirnayasindhu 61-76, SmK 69-80, Dharmasindhu 32-35, Gadādharapaddhati (Kālasāra) 588-599. A total eclipse of the Sun is referred to even in the Rgveda V. 40.5, 6, 8 'O Sun! when Svarbhānu, the son of an asura, struck you with darkness. O Indra! when you struck down the wiles of Svarbhānu that existed below the heaven, Atri secured the Sun which had been concealed by darkness that deviated from the usual rule (or law) by means of the highest (or 4th) prayer' &c.621 It is stated in the Sankhāyana Brāhmaṇa

(24.3) that the Atris performed the Saptadaśa-stoma three days before Visuvat and thereby smote the demon Svarbhānu that had pierced the sun with darkness i. e. the solar eclipse (in Rg. V. 40.5 ff.) took place three days before the autumnal Visuvat (equinox). 

It appears from the Bșhat-samhitā that the real cause of eclipses was known to Indian astronomers several centuries before Varāhamihira (1st half of 6th century A. D.) who remarks622 'In a lunar eclipse the moon enters into the shadow of the earth and in a solar eclipse the moon enters the Sun (i. e, comes between the sun and the earth), that this cause of eclipses was found by (former) ācāryas who had a divine insight; that Rāhu is not the cause (of eclipses); this is the true state that the śāstra (of astronomy) declares (or this is the real intent of śāstra)'. In spite of this correct theory of eclipses, common people and even learned men (not astronomers) then believed and do believe up to the present day that Rāhu is the cause of eclipses and regard an eclipse as a special occasion for bath, gifts, japa, śrāddha and the like. Varāhamihira makes an effort623 to square Sruti, Smrti, popular belief and real astronomical doctrine by the remark that there was an Asura on whom a boon was conferred by Brahmā 'You will be gratified by a por tion of the gifts and offerings made on an eclipse', that Asura remains present to receive his portion and that therefore it is metaphorically (poetically) said that he is Rāhu. Rationalism and popular traditions and superstition cannot go together. Some difference was made between an eclipse of the Sun and

It is difficult to say what the words तुरीयेण ब्रह्मणा exactly mean, the 4th verse (car ) from the 5th appears to say that Atri prepared to extract Soma, offered worship with a hymn of praise and prostrated himself before the gods and that thereby Atri restored the eye of the Heavens viz. the orb of the sun to its usual splendour and (with the favour of Indra and Varuna ) dispelled the wiles of Svarbhānu. It is probable that Atri and his family assured tbe common people that the sun would in a short time appear in all his glory.'

that of the moon. Vyāsa says: 624 an eclipse of the moon is one hundred thousand times (more meritorious than an ordinary day) and an eclipse of the Sun ten times more so than the preceding and if the waters of the Ganges are near (for a bath) then a moon eclipse is one crore of times (more meritorious) and a sun's eclipse is ten times more so than the preceding'. 

The first duty of a person on seeing an eclipse is to bathe. It is said 'on 625 seeing Rāhu (i. e. eclipse) men of all varņas become impure. They should first bathe and then do their usual duties and should give up food already cooked (before the eclipse)'. Peculiar sanctity was deemed to attach to the time of grahaņa. If a man 626 does not take a bath at the time of eclipse, at the passage (of the sun) from one rāśr to another, there is no doubt that he would suffer from leprosy for seven future lives and sorrow would be his lot.' He should take a bath in cold water and in as holy a place as possible. The holiest bath is the one in the Ganges or Godāvarl or at Prayāga, then in any one 627 of the big rivers such as the six rivers connected with Himayat mountain and the six south of the Vindhya mentioned in the Brahmapurāņa, then in any other water, since at the time of eclipse all water becomes holy like Ganges water. A bath with hot water was allowed only to children, old mon and persons that were ill. One had 628 to take a bath when the

eclipse began, to perform homa, worship of gods and śrāddha while the eclipse was in progress, to make gifts when the eclipse was about to end, and to take a bath again when the sun or moon became free from eclipse. Even a person who is impure owing to a birth or death has to take a bath on an eclipse but he is not to make a gift or to perform śrāddha (according to Gauda writers), but the Madanaratna and the Nirnayasindhu refute this view and hold that in an eclipse even one who is in āśauca can take a bath, perform śrāddha and purascarana.629 In the purānas and medieval digests some distinction as regards merit or holiness was made between eclipses in certain months and baths in certain rivers or holy places. The Kālanirnaya (p. 350 ) especially commends the Godāvari for a bath in a lunar eclipse and one in the Narmadā for a solar eclipse. The Krtyakalpataru (Naijata kāla), Hemādri on Kala and the Kālaviveka quote 630 a long passage from the Devipurāna, some verses of which may be rendered here: 'an eclipse in Kārtika is the highest (in merit) at the confluence of the Gangā and Yamunā, in Mārgasirsa on Dovikā, in Pausa Narmadā is holy, in Māgha Sannihitā is holy' &c. On the occasion of the partial eclipse of the sun on 20th June 1955 about four hundred thousand people took a bath at Kuruksetra and Sanyahet (Sannihitā of ancient times). 

The general rule is that one should not take a bath, make a gift or perform a śrāddha at night. Apastamba 631 says 'let him avoid a bath at night'. Manu says 'one should not perform a $rāddha at night, she (night) is declared to be a rāksasi (a demon) and also at both twilights and when the sun has just risen'. But eclipses were an exception as regards bath, gift and śrāddha. Yājñavalkya enumerates 632 eclipses among the proper times for śrāddha.

It is stated by Sātātapa 633 that gifts, baths, tapas and śrāddha at the time of eclipses yield inexhaustible ( rewards or merit ); the night is a rāksasi elsewhere ( at times other than those of eclipses ); therefore one should avoid it (in other matters). A passage is quoted from the Mahābhārata 634 'on ayana and Vaşuva days and on the occasion of the eclipses of the sun and the moon, one should make a gift of land together with dakşiņā to a deserving brāhmaṇa'. Yājñavalkya succin ctly observes ' not by learning alone nor by tapas alone (does one become a deserving person); that is declared a deserving person (pātrı) in whom these two (lirlyū and tapas ) and actions ( appropriate to these ) are found.' Numerous inscrip tions published so far bear witness to the fact that over the whole of India ancient and medieval kings and well-to-do people carried out to the letter this recommendation of making gifts of land on eclipses. Some inscriptions are mentioned here by way of illustration. Vide for gifts on solar eclipses the following: I.A.

Even now poor people create a pandemonium in towns and cities clamouring for clothes and cash. 

As regards śrāddha, it is often difficult to perform it at the time of an eclipse for two reasons. Most eclipses are partial and the time is short. Besides, there is a prohibition to eat food during an eclipse. A prājāpatya expiation is prescribed for partaking of food during an eclipse.635 It is therefore provided in some smrtis and digests that the śrāddha performed should be the āmaśrāddha or hemaśrāddha 636. Though the person performing śrāddha in an eclipse is deemed to reap great merit, the person partaking of śrāddha dinner is liable to undergo an expiation and is generally looked down upon. The Mitāksarā on Yāj. I. 217–218 quotes the first quarter of a verse 'one should not eat during a solar or lunar eclipse ? 637 Therefore a good brāhmaṇa cannot be easily secured and the performance of śrāddha with details is well-nigh impossible, even though Sātātapa and others state that it is obligatory : 'on seeing Rāhu (i. e. an eclipse) one should perform a śrāddha even at the cost of all his wealth; one who does not perform śrāddha then sinks like a cow in mud.' The order of the several acts on an eclipse is : first bath in Ganges or other water, prāņā.

yāma, tarpana, japa of Gāyatri, homa in fire with sesame with the vyāhrtis and the mantras for the planets as in Yāj. I. 300-301, then āmaśrāddha, gifts of gold, food, cows and land. 

In these days most people except very sophisticated ones still take a bath on eclipses and make sone gifts also, but do not proceed further in the matter of eclipses. An eclipse is the best time for japa and for diksā (initiation) and perfection in the mantras peculiar to various deities: 'one638 should engage in japa and the like while an eclipse of the sun or moon is in progress; one should not bathe nor eat food during that time, but when the sun and the moon are free from eclipse one should bathe and partake of food: one may engage in the japa of the Gāyatri mantra (Rg. III. 62.10) and it is laid down that if one does not engage in japa on an eclipse one becomes sinful. For diksā as to mantras seven days from eclipse are allowed. Solar eclipse is the best time for dikşā. 

The Punyakāla (the holy period) in the case of eclipses lasts only as long as the eclipse is visible to the eye. Jābāli says 639 'In the case of sankrānti the puṇyakala is 16 kalās on both sides thereof, but in the case of a lunar or solar eclipse it lasts only so long as the eclipse is visible'. This leads on to a question that is very much discussed in the several medieval works and on which there is great divergence of views. Much emphasis is laid on the words 'yāvad-darśana-go-caraḥ' and 

Tāhudarśane' occurring in several verses (quoted in the notes, 633, 639 &c.). The Kṛtyakalpataru ( Naiyatakāla ) argues that in those passages darśana' (being visible) is declared to be the cause or occasion of the several acts (snāna, dana &o.) to be performed in an eclipse, that an eclipse is an occasion only when it is known that it has occurred, and that knowledge must be derived from the eye and that

therefore when the sun or moon is screened from view by clouds one need not enter upon a bath and the like prescribed in the case of an eclipse.640 Hemādri on Kāla quotes this view and criticizes it in several ways. He first relies on Manu IV. 37 that prescribes that one should never see the sun when it is rising or setting or when it is eclipsed or is reflected in water or when it is in mid-sky. If actual seeing were necessary, that is an impossible condition as Manu has prohibited it and the result would be that one need not bathe when an eclipse is really on. He further says that sistas do observe bath &c. even if they do not actually see the eclipse. Therefore, he proposes that punyakāla exists so long as the eclipse is deduced to last from the śāstra ( of astronomy). The Krtyaratnākara 611 (pp. 625–26 ) discusses the question, remarks that snāna and the other prescribed actions should be performed during that period in which the eclipse can be seen. It was argued by some that an eclipse by itself (and not seeing it) is the occasion on which bath, gift &c. must be observed; to this the Kālaviveka 612 gave the reply that, if mere existence of an eclipse were an occasion for bath, then the unacceptable con clusion would be that even if the moon were to be eclipsed (in some other country) according to astronomical calculations a person in a different country would have to undergo a bath by day for a lunar eclipse in a distant land. The Smrti kaustubha and Samayaprakāśa 643 therefore lay down that what is meant by 'darśana-gocarah' is that when one knows from the astronomical science that the eclipse is capable of being seen with the eye in a particular country one should at the respective times perform bath and the like (even though one may not actually see it). The Samvatsara-pradīpa is quite explicit 'that is said to be an eclipse which can be observed by the eye; one

should perform religious acts on such an eclipse, but not on mere calculation.' 

If a solar eclipse occurs on a Sunday and a lunar one on Monday, such a conjunction was called Cādāmani and it was laid down that a Cūdamani eclipse yields one crore of times as much merit as an eclipse on other week days.641 

Some held that on the day previous to an eclipse one should observe a fast; but Hemādri provided that a fast was to be observed on the day of the eclipse. 645 A householder however who had a son living was not to observe a fast as laid down in a text.646 

About partaking of food before, during and after an eclipse elaborate rules were laid down from comparatively early times. The Vispudharmasūtra 647 provides: 'one must not eat during an eclipse of the moon or sun; he should eat, after having previously taken a bath, when the eclipse is at an end; if the sun or moon have set before the eclipse was over he must bathe and on the next day he may eat again after having seen the sun rise! This is elaborated in two verses quoted in several works: 'One should not take food before a solar eclipse and also in the evening of the day of a lunar eclipse; and one should not eat when the eclipse is in progress; but when the sun or 

moon is free from eclipse one may, after a bath, partake of food; when the moon is free from eclipse one may take food ( even at night thereafter ) provided it is not mahānisā; when the sun or moon sets before being free from eclipse, one should see them rising the next day, bathe and then partake of food'.

It was further prescribed that not only was one not to eat during an eclipse, but in the case of a lunar eclipse one was not to eat for three praharas (9 hours or 221 ghatikās) before the eclipse started and for four praharas before a solar eclipse starts, but this does not apply to children, old men and women.618 This period of three or four praharas before an eclipse was called and even now is called 'vedha'. The Krtyatattva (p. 434) collects together in one place all the above propositions about taking food. Although these rules are not generally observed in these days by people in cities and by educated people, in the author's boyhood they were strictly observed by almost all adults educated or illiterate. 

Certain astrological results were deemed to follow from eclipses. One or two are cited here for illustration. The Visnudharmottara 619 states that if in one and the same month there is first an eclipse of the moon and then of the sun, that occurrence would tend to create disputes between brāhmaṇas and ksatriyas, but if the opposite was the case, then there would be prosperity. The same purāna says that persons born on the naksatra on which there is an eclipse of the sun or moon suffer troubles unless they perform śānti rites (to avert the evil results). Hemādri (on Kāla pp. 392-93) quotes several verses from Garga about the prognostications derived from eclipses of the sun and moon when they are in certain naksatras. Atri provides :650 'When the moon and the sun are eclipsed in the naksatra of a man's birth, that forebodes disease, long journeys, death and great danger from the king (of the country)'.

LIST OF VRATAS AND UTSAVAS 

The following list of vratas and utsavas does not claim to be thoroughly exhaustive. But it is far more exhaustive and informative than any similar list so far prepared in English by any one or contained in any work in English. The line of demarcation between yratas and utsavas is very thin. Many vratas contain an element of festivities and many utsavas have more or less a religious element also and were religious in the beginning though later on they became secular, like the Olympic games of Greece. It may be pointed out that in the Asiatic Researches, vol. III, Sir William Jones published a list of Hindu festival days based on the Tithitattva (pp. 257-293 ) and Prof. Kielhorn also inserted a list of festival days based mainly on the Dharmasindhu in I. A. vol. 26 pp. 177-187. Both these are meagre. The Indian Ephemeris ( vol. I part 1 pp. 55-69 ) has a long descriptive list and a brief but accurate account of Indian festivals in relation to tithis and vice versa. Yet it is not as exhaustive as this list will be and it refers hardly to any autho ritative texts. Very recently in the Report (1953) of the Calendar Reform Committee presided over by the late Dr. M. N. Saha there is a list of lunar festivals ( from Caitra onward) and solar festi vals and of some important tithis (pp. 101–108) and an alphabeticed list of festivals ( pp. 111-115), which is exhaustive but its great defect is that no texts are cited or referred to and hardly any details are given except month, paksa and tithi. There are a few works on vratas written in Bengali and other regional languages of India, but I could not include most of them in this volume as I do not know most of those languages, though I have referred to some of them. Apart from vratas and utsavas certain matters and technical terms that occur frequently in works on vratas have been included. The list is arranged in the Sanskrit alphabetical order, though everything is transliterated into the English alphabet for the convenience of printing. For saving space abbreviations have been very largely employed and a list of the most important abbreviations is given in the preceding pages. As regards each vrata the time when it begins, whether it is a tithivrata or pāravrata, samvatsara-vrata or & naksatravrata or a prakirpaka vrata is generally indicated ( except where from its very title or descrip tion its nature is clear), the deity to be worshipped is pointed

out where possible or necessary, some details are added in certain cases, and some of the works in which it is described are mentioned. The rewards promised are not generally set out, as most of them are included in the rewards mentioned on p. 55–56 above, and as they are often too numerous to specify and also for reasons of space. Similarly, tithis that are Yugādi or Yugāntya or Manvādi or Kalpādi have not all been noted as they are too many but they are enumerated in one place under the words Yugādi &c. I have made great efforts to trace the Paurāņic quotations to their sources, but I regret that I have not been quite successful owing to several causes such as the vast extent of Purānas, owing to several recensions of the same purāna and owing to my inadvertence or sheer weariness. One feels that tracing a verse to its origin is often as difficult as finding a pin in a haystack. The author or authors of Purānas often wrote like modern advertisers of medicines, toilet articles &c. Most of the yratas are said to have been declared by divi nities like Śiva to Pārvati, by Krsna to Yudhisthira, by great sages like Mārkandeya, Nārada, Dhaumya, Yājñavalkya, Vasistha and it is often added that the Vrata is a great secret not narrated or known even to gods and goddesses e. g. Siva Tātrivrata (in HV II. 88). 

1 

It may not be out of place to point out here what should be done about the numerous yratas and utsavas, described so far and to be mentioned in the long list that follows. Many of the vratas and utsavas once observed have already gone out of vogue owing to various causes. But it would not do to recommend the abolition of all yratas and utsavas even in the latter half of the 20th century. Some seasonal yratas and festivals should be kept up as in the case of Divāli and Holikā, but they should be shorn of extravagances like gambling on Balipratipadā or the obscenities and dirt-throwing indulged in by some people in Holika. Other yratas and utsavas like the Rāmanavami, Vijaya daśami, Krsna-janmāstami should also be celebrated in order to remind the present generation of the great heroes and aratūras of the past and the supreme values they exemplified in their lives and a few new ones such as the Jayantis of Shivaji, Guru Govindsingh, Tagore, Tilak and Gandhi may be added. Besides, such vratas as Vata-sāvitri and Haritālikā may still be empha sized for observance by women and lastly such nice observances redolent of disinterested regard and affection as Raksābandhana and Bhrātņdvitīyā deserve to be preserved.List of vratas 

255 

It should be remembered that several vratas depend con jointly upon month, tithi and naksatra together. It is difficult to classify such vratas and my classification may in some cases appear to be arbitrary. For saving space the details mentioned above will not generally be conveyed in regular sentences, but in catch-words only. The figures after the abbreviated name of a work represent pages and Roman figures refer to volumes or parts; and double Arabic figures with a dot between represent chapter and verses respectively. As most vratas are tithivratas, the word tithi is not mentioned where the vrata has reference to a tithi alone and to no other particular (such as month or week-day &c.). The word vrata has been generally omitted after the names, except where I felt that doubt or confusion is likely to be caused. The word 'purāna' is not added to the names of purānas such as Agni, Vāmana &c. Except in the case of purānas references to medieval digests and commentaries are generally arranged in chronological order. The following abbreviations are used for months and half months: Cai. = Caitra, Vai. = Vaišākha, Jy. = Jyestha, Ās. = Āsādha, Śr. = Śrāvana, Bh. =Bhādrapada, Āśv.=Āśvina, K.=Kārtika, Mārg. = Mārgaśirsa, P. = Pausa, M, = Māgha, Phā. = Phālguna; Su.or śu.= Sukla, Kr. or kr.= Krsna (paksa).

PC 316 read a half verse 'this yoga is commended only if it occurs by day and not so if at night.' KSS 30 provides that if one out of the several requirements (Pausa or Māgha Amāyāsyā, Vyatīpāta, Sravana-naksatra, Sunday ) is absent, it becomes Mahodaya-parva. In Ardhodaya a bath at Prayāga in the morning is most meritorious, but it is pro vided that all rivers become like the Ganges at Ardhodaya, The devatās of the vrata are three viz. Brahmā, Vişnu and Maheśvara and they are worshipped in the same order; offerings (of ghee) are made in fire with Paurānika mantras, and also with three Vedic mantras viz. 'Prajāpate' (Rg. X. 121. 10) for Brahmā, 'Idam Visnur' (Rg. I 22, 17 ) for Vişnu, "Tryambakam yajāmahe' (Rg. VII. 59. 12) for Maheśvara. At the end gifts of cow or money are made. In I. A. vol. 25 p. 345 there is mention of Ardhodaya in sake 1352, Pausa, which corresponds to 14th January (Sunday) 1431 A. D. The reference to the distribution of all his wealth by Emperor Harsavardhana at Prayāga once in five years made by the Chinese traveller Yuan Chwang (vide 7 I. A. 196 at p. 198) is not to Ardhodaya at all, as some suppose. If Beal's B. R. W. W. vol. I. pp. 214 and 233 be 

carefully read this will be clear.

18 occurs the word 'sārasanaḥ' which reminds one of 'Saracen'. Vide Nār. I. 116. 29–31 for AVYANGĀKHYA VRATA, the 7th tithi being destroyer of sins if it is conjo ined to Hasta-naksatra. Avyanga appars to be a Sanskrit adaptation of the Avestan 'Aivyanghana' (meaning'girdle"). In the 16 ślokas addressed to the prince Jadi Rānā by the Parsis emigrating to India occurs this 'who put on the waist a woollen kushti which is fastened on the sadra (garment), each end of which is like the mouth of a serpent, which is tied into knots at equal distances' ( vide M. M. Murzban's 'Parsis in India 'vol. I at p. 93). It seems probable that this particular form of Sun-worship was imported from Iran or was borrowed from Parsi practices. The Br. S. (59.19 ) states that the priests of Savitr should be Magas i. e. Maga or Sākadvipiya brābmanas for whom vido I. A. vol. VIII. 328 and Weber's edition of Magavyakti of Krishnadas

The Matsya contains a somewhat different mode; HVI. 366-371 (from Bhav.) and 371-377 (from Bhav U); KR 225-228 ( quotes Bhav I. 20.4-28). This vrata secured avaidharya to women and aviyoga ( absence of the loss of wife ) to men. Vide S. Pr. (folio 22b ) and SmK 146-148. One of the mantras that occur in both KKV 43 and HV I. 373 is 'Laksmyš na sūnyam varada yathā te sayanam sadā sayyā mamāpyaśūnyāstu tathātra Madhu sūdana'l. KR (p. 228 ) remarks that when it is said that the vrata begins in Sr. Kr., the month is pārņi mānta according to the usage.

Different rewards acc. to length of time, the greatest being that after twelve years of this vrata the observer may secure the rulership of the world and on death become one with Janārdana. Vi. Dh. III. 218. 1-25 4. by HV II. 825-827. The word means the vrata is as sharp ur difficult as treading on the edge of a sword.

Ahan-a day. There are several views about the divisions of 

the day, viz. into two, three, four, five, eight, or fifteen parts. The two are pūrvāhna and aparāhņa ( as in Manu III. 278 ); for three vide notes 257–258 above. Four parts described by Gobhila (q. by KN p. 110 ) are pūrvāhna ( for 1) prahara ), madhyāhna for one prahara, aparāhna up to the end of the 3rd prahara and thereafter sāyāhna till end of day. For names of five divisions vide H. of Dh. vol. IV p. 376. In Rg. V. 76. 3 (utāyātam sangave prātarahno) three of the five parts of a day viz. prūtah, sangava and malhyandina are expressly mentioned. Eight divisions of the day are men tioned by Kautilya (I. 19), Daksa ( chap. 2) and Katyāyana. Kālidāsa in Vikramorvāśiya II. 1 (sasthe bhāge) appears to know this. There are fifteen muhūrtas of the day and fifteen of the night. Vide Bșhadyogayātrā VI. 2-4 for 15 muhurtas. As the day and night become long or short at different places (except on the equator) each of the muhurtas will vary in length to some extent even in the same place in different seasons of the year. Similarly, pūrvāhpa or prātaḥkāla will be of 71 muhūrtas if day is divided only in two parts, if into five parts pūrvāhṛa or prātaḥ will comprise only three muhūrtas. The KN (p. 112) remarks that the division into five parts being observed in many Vedic and Smrti texts as the principal division, that division, is the one resorted to in the śāstric passages about positive and negative injunctions. Vide HK 325-329, VKK 18–19, KTV

and a golden deer; samvatsara vrata ; KKV 444, HV II. 865 

( quoting Pad. = Mat. 101. 35). Ahirbradhnasnūna-HV II. pp. 654-655 (from Vi. Dh. ). On a 

day on which there is Pūrvābhādrapada-naksatra performer to bathe in water from two jars in which are put udumbara leaves, pañcagavya, water with kušas, sandalwood paste &c; worship of Ahirbradhna, the Sun, Varupa, the moon, Rudra, and Vişnu. Ahirbudhnya was the presiding deity of Uttarābhādrapadā acc. to Br. S. 97.5, Bhav U. q. by HV II p. 596, KR 560. Vide H. of Dh. II. p. 247, note 563 for the devatās of all naksatrag. This secured thousands of cows and highest prosperity. Ahirbudhnya is the correct and ancient form. In about ten passages of the Rgveda 'Ahirbudhnyah' appears to be some deity (probably Agni),

on Wednesday and on Punarvasu. Ašokikāştami-Worship of Umā. NM p. 74 (verses 905-907) 

states that Asoka plant is Devī herself. Asvatthavruta-Vratārka ( folio 406b-408a ) from Adbhutasagara 

following Atharvanaśākhā; worship of Aśvattha in case of 

evil portents, invasions, epidemics, diseases like leprosy. Ašvadīksā—When the moon is in Syati in Asv. su., worship 

Uccaiḥ śravas and one's own horses may be honoured if there be 9th tithi; Sānti rites and threads coloured in four colours 

to be tied round horses' necks; NM p. 77 verses 943—947. Aśvapājā-On Āśy. śu. 1 to 9; see below under Āśvina. Ašvavrataa Samvatsarayrata; Indra is the deity; Mat. 101.71 

q. by KKV 449, HV II. 911 (quotes same 17 verses from Pad). Aştamivratas-There are about 30 Astami-yratas, which will be 

entered at the proper places. General rule is that in the bright half Astami mixed with Navami is to be preferred and in dark half astami mixed with saptami is preferred. Vide TT 40, DS 15. For Astamīyratas vide HV I. 811-886, KN 194-228, KKV 225–272, VR 256-319, VKK 38-40, PC. 109-139. There are a few exceptions to above two rules, 

some of which may be noted at the proper places. Asidhārāvrata-begin on Āş, śu. 15; five days or ten days after Ās. 

15, K.15 or for 4 months from Ās., or one year or 12 years; one has to sleep on bare ground, to bathe outside house, eat food only in the night, to remain celibate even though sleeping in wife's embrace, curb anger and be devoted to japa and homa to Hari. Different rewards acc. to length of time, the greatest being that after twelve years of this vrata the observer may secure the rulership of the world and on death become one with Janārdana. Vi. Dh. III. 218. 1-25 q. by HV II. 825-827. The word means the vrata is as sharp ur difficult as treading on the edge of a sword. The Raghuvamsa 13. 67 in referring to Bharata's abstention from enjoying regal splendour out of regard for the exiled Rāma calls it ugra 'iyanti varşāņi tayā sahogram-abhyasyativa vratam āsidhāram'.List of vratas

Ahan-a day. There are several views about the divisions of 

the day, viz. into two, three, four, five, eight, or fifteen parts. The two are pūrvāhna and aparābņa ( as in Manu III. 278 ); for three vide notes 257-258 above. Four parts described by Gobhila (q. by KN p. 110 ) are purvāhņa (for 14 prahara ), madhyāhna for one prahara, aparāhna up to the end of the 3rd prahara and thereafter sāyāhna till end of day. For names of five divisions vide H. of Dh. vol. IV p. 376. In Rg. V. 76. 3 (utāyātam sangave prātarahno) three of the five parts of a day viz. prūlah, sangara and madhyunding are expressly mentioned. Eight divisions of the day are men tioned by Kautilya (I. 19), Daksa (chap. 2) and Katyāyana. Kalidasa in Vikramoryāśiya II. 1 (sasthe bhāge) appears to know this. There are fifteen muhurtas of the day and fifteen of the night. Vide Bphadyogayātrā VI. 2-4 for 15 muhurtas. As the day and night become long or short at different places (except on the equator ) each of the muhūrtas will vary in length to some extent even in the same place in different seasons of the year. Similarly, pūrvāhna or prātaḥkāla will be of 71 muhūrtas if day is divided only in two parts, if into five parts pūrvahna or prātaḥ will comprise only three muhurtas. The KN (p. 112) remarks that the division into five parts being observed in many Vedic and Smrti texts as the principal division, that division, is the one resorted to in the śāstric passages about positive and negative injunctions. Vide HK 325-329, VKK 18-19, KTV 

6, 367. Ahiinsāvrata-not to eat flesh for a year and then donate a cow 

and a golden deer; samvatsaravrata ; KKV 444, HV II 865 

( quoting Pad. = Mat. 101. 35 ). Ahirbradhnasnāna-HV II. pp. 654-655 (from Vi. Dh.). On a 

day on which there is Purvābhadrapadā-naksatra performer to bathe in water from two jars in which are put udumbara leaves, pañcagavya, water with kušas, sandalwood paste &c; worship of Ahirbradhna, the Sun, Varupa, the moon, Rudra, and Visņu. Ahirbudhnya was the presiding deity of Uttarābhadrapadā acc. to Br. S. 97. 5, Bhay U. q. by HV I p. 596, KR 560. Vide H. of Dh. II. p. 247, note 563 for the devatās of all naksatras. This secured thousands of cows and highest prosperity. Ahirbudhnya is the correct and ancient form. In about ten passages of the Rgveda 'Ahirbudhnyaḥ' appears to be some deity (probably Agni),

The word ' utsava' occurs in Rg. I. 100. 8 and I. 102. 1 and is derived from the root su in the sense of urging or inspiring' by Sāyaṇa. Vide India Antiqua' (a volume presented to Dr. J. Ph.

derives it from root su' (rather unconvincingly). Udakasaptami-drinking only a handful of water on 7th tithi

and mystic Roman Bacchanalia. In HV II 359-365, KKN 413-421 and KR 387-395 this festival is described at length from the Skanda. The origin is traced to Bhairava and a girl called Udasevikā ( whose body was smeared with mud) sprung from the mind of Siva and Parvati respectively. They became husband and wife. All people become on this day vociferous about sexual matters. Men and women go out like crazy persons, ride asses, bulls and dogs, smear themselves with ashes and mud, even men 100 years old act like boys, become void of shame, utter obscene songs, dress like cowherds, dombas, barbers and also went about naked. It is remarkable that Skanda averred that gods and pitss did not accept the offerings of a man who did not take part in this festival and remained aloof. There was difference of views about the time when the utsava was to be celebrated. Vide HV II p. 368, and VP ( folios 91-92), which place it in 

Jy. kr. 1 to 15 ( by pūrņimānta reckoning). Uddalakavrata-Vide Vas. Dh. S. XI. 76-77; it was prescribed 

for one who was patitasāvitrīka. See H. of Dh. vol. II pp. 376-377. In HV II p. 932 ( from Brah.), it is described as subsisting on āmiksā and boiled milk for two months each, eight days on curds, three days on ghee and total fast for 

one day. Udyāpana-Vide pp. 120–21 above. It is said in KTV 95 that 

in some yratas like Krsnajanmāstams to be observed 

throughout one's life there is no udyāpana. Unmilanivrata Ekadasi mixed with dvadasi. Vide p. 119 above;

It consists in asking an atithi what he wants and in offering what he wants. There is the story of Aviksit, son of Karandhama, whose mother had undertaken this vrata and who had made a promise to his mother to carry out her vrata. He proclaimed 'śrnvantu merthinaḥ sarve pratijn ātam mayā tadā 1 kimicchatha dadāmyeșa kriyamāņe

Moon should be in Makara rāśi, Jupiter in Taurus (Vrsabha), there is amāyāsyā; this is called Kumbhayoga. Bath at Prayāga on this yoga is deemed to be more meritorious than a thousand Aśvamedhas, a hundred Vājapeyas and a lakh of pradakşiņās round the earth. Bath at Prayāga and the large concourse of sādhus are the two predominant objects of those who gather there in thousands and sometimes millions. It is in three parts, first is Makarasankranti, the 2nd ( the chief one and called Pūrņakumbha ) is amāvāsyā and 3rd is Vasantapancami, In 1954 A. D. the threo datos were 14th January, 3rd February and 7th February. Some hold that the three days are Makarasankranti, Pausa Pūrņimā and Amāvāsyā.

It is said that Gauri was cursed to be kokilā by Siva after he destroyed Daksa's sacrifice. A golden image of female cuckoo with feet of silver and pearls for eyes is worshipped with 16 upacāras. It is performed for saubhāgya and prosperity. In Tamil calendars it is shown on Jy.

Mat. 93. describes all the three. Vide Nșsimha-purāna 35, Br. S. 45. 6 (which prescribes Kotihoma against divya utpātas) and Harsacarita V. where it is referred to as being performed when Prabhā

When there is conjunction of Rohiņi and the Moon on 14th tithi, or of Astami and the Moon, that is Candravrata in which Siva may be worshipped and nairedya of milk and curds be offered and one may subsist on milk and secure fame, health and prosperity. When Rovati, Thursday and 14th tithi or Astami and Pusya are joined, that is Guruvrata, on which one should subsist on the milk of a kapilā cow mixed with the fluid extracted from Brāhmi plants ; the person becomes master of speech. The Visnudharmasūtra (chap. 90.1-15) deals with what is to be done when the Full Moon days of Mārg. to K. are in conjunction with the naksatra which gives the name to the month and the rewards of the observances thereon; vide Dānasāgara pp. 622-626, where V.

deals with only ten, while HV speaks of 33. Vratas connected with the naksatras from Aśvini onwards are set out in HV. HK 126-128 and KN 327-328, NA 18 deal with question as to what should be done when a fast is to be observed in a vrata which is concerned with both tithi and naksatra. The rule is that the naksatra for fast must be existing at the time of sunset or at the time when there is a conjunction of the Moon with midnight (i. e. there is the required naksatra at midnight). The first of these two is the principal matter, the 2nd is only next best (anukalpa ). Vide Vi. Dh. I. 60. 26–27 for this rule q. by KN 327, HK 126, VKK 8. 

Nakşatrahomavidhi--HV (II. 684-688 ) quotes Garga in proge 

for the procedure of offering worship and homa to 27 nakşatras from Ašvini to Revati detailing how many days an illness or danger will last, the deity to be worshipped, the flowers, naivedya, dhūpa, the tree of which fuel sticks are to be offered to Agni, the pūjā mantra, the main material to be offered into fire. One illustrative example is given here. In the case of Rohiņi, eight days, Prajāpati is dovatā, the naivedya is rice boiled in milk, lotus flowers, dhūpa is the one extracted from the Sarala tree ( a kind of pine ), the pūjā mantra is namo brahmane' (Tai. Ār. II. 13, quoted in H. of Dh. II. p. 703 n. 681 ); all dhānyas may be offered in fire. The Xhutis are to be 108; the reward is ārogya ( health ).

When the Moon and Jupiter are seen together (in the same naksatra) on a Full Moon day, that Paurņamāsi is called great (Mahā), gifts and fasts on such a paurpamāsi yield inexhaustible merit (V. Dh. 49. 9–10 q. by KR pp. 430-431 and KKN 373); vide KV 346-347, HK 640, VKK 77 and Vi. Dh. I. 60.21 for a similar verse. Such a paurņamāsi is called mahā-caitrī, mahā-kārtiki, mahā-pausi &c. Vide Cintra prasasti of Sārangadeva (of 20–1-1287 A. D.) for provision made for festival of Caitra full Moon and Bhadrapada Full Moon, in E. I. vol. I. p. 271 at p. 279. When Paurņamāsi or Amāvāsyā is viddhā the tithi mixed with 1st tithi is to be accepted except in case of Vațasāvitri; KN 300-301,

Bṛhaspati he prospers (q. by KR 484). Pauşavratas-KR 474-486, VKK 487-490, NS 211-12, SmK 

432-439; some matters are briefly mentioned here. Stream of clarified butter in P. on Siva (linga) from a vessel with song, dance and instrumental music and with illuminations makes the performer free from all sins and takes him 

to Sivaloka (KR 478); on P. śu. 8th with Wednesday, bath, japa, homa, feeding brāhmanas in worship of Siva yields merit thousands of times (NS 211); fast on P. 9th of both pakşas and worship of Durgā thrice in the day, nakta for whole month and bathing Durgā image in ghee, feeding eight maidens and worship of Durgā image made of flour, 

lead a man to Durgā-loka (KR 477 from Bhav.). Pauştika-Br. S. 2 enumerates among the qualifications of the 

sāmvatsara ( astrologer) that he should be well-versed in the śāntika and paustike rites. The difference between the two is: Paustika rites are homa and the like performed for longe vity, while Santika rites are homa and the like performed for averting threatened evil influence of planets and danger foreboded by unusual occurrences like comets, meteor showers &c.; NA 48. KKN 254 states that Santi means the removal of worldly calamities by means of acts in accordance with 

Dharma (or Dharmaśāstra ). Prakırnaka-(miscellaneous) vratag--Vide KKV 452-468,H V II: 

868-1002, KR540-593, KN 326-358, VKK 533-564. Most of

with Purusasūkta (Rg. X. 90) with gandha &c.; Purusa and Praksti are identical with Agni and Soma and the same are Vāgudeva and Laksmi; worship Lakşmi with Srisūkta; gifts of gold, silver and copper; performer to subsist on milk and ghee; for a year; secures all desires and the road to 

mokşa; HV I. pp. 391-92 (from Vi. Dh. III. 129. 1-6). Prajāpativrata-in the Sankhāyana Br. VI, 6 it is said 'he 

should not see the Sun rising or setting'. These rules are called Prajāpatiyrata by Sabara on Jai. IV. I 3 and he

declares that they are 'puruşārtha' and not 'kratvartha'; (2) In the Praśnopanisad I. 13 and 15 it is said 'day is the prāna and the night the food of Prajāpati and those who have sexual intercourse by day attack prāņa while those that have it by night are observing brahmacarya; that those who observe the Prajāpati-vrata produce children (a son and a daughter).' In Praśna I. 15 Prajāpativrata means indulging in sexual intercourse only at night; this meaning is different 

from that given by Sabara. Prati pad-vratas--Agni 176 (only two yratas), KKV 35-40, 

HV I. 335-365; KN 140–149, PC 56-81, VR 49-78, HK 614 (quoting Bhav.) say the 1st tithis of Cai., K. and Āśv. are the holiest (also HV II. 350). If Pratipad is viddhū all

description of this vrata. Bhişmūstamī-on M. śu. 8; offer water and śrāddha every year 

to Bhīşma who died a bachelor; he who does so becomes free from sins committed in one year and secures progeny; HK 628-29, VKK 503, TT 58, NS 221, SM 61. One whose father is alive also can offer water to Bhīşma (SM 61 ). This tithi is probably based on Anušāsanaparva 167, 28 ( Māgho yam samanuprāpto ... tribhāgasosah pakşoyam śuklo bhavi tumarhati). With great respect to Prof. P. C. SenGupta I must say that his interpretation of 'samanuprāpta' as 'samanupravişta' is quite wrong and unwarranted and it is not possible to accept his conclusion that Bhisma died on 8th of dark half of Māgha and not on 8th of bright half. Vide his paper in JASB vol. XX No. 1 ( Letters ) pp. 39-41 (1954). The Bhujabalanibandha p. 364 has two verses, which are quoted in TT, NS and other works ' ia माघस्य दद्याद् भीष्माय यो जलम् । संवत्सरकृतं पापं तत्क्षणादेव नश्यति ॥ वैयाघ्रपद्य 71714 algasare ai 3197114 Gwards Hallo Il'.

113–114, VKK 504. Bhairavajayantı-K. kr. 8 is known as Kālāstami; fast on that 

tithi and jāgara; worship of Bhairava for four praharas of the night and jāgara in listening to and narrating legends about Siva; the performer becomes free from sins and becomes a good devotee of Siva; this is obligatory on persons 

dwelling in Kāśī; SM 60-61, SMK 427-429, PC 138. Bhogasankrāntivrata-on Sankranti day call together women

There is a pun on Kujanmā that has two senses (1) born on an inauspicious day', (2) born of the earth'. As Mars is red in appearance, copper, red cloth and saffron are used to match his colour; HV II. 567 (from Bhav.

M. 1366 ( vide ABORI. vol. 36 p. 331 for three verses on Māghisnāna) and it adds that in Māgha waters exclaim when the Sun is just risen 'what great sinner, whether a drinker of surā or murderer of a brāhmaṇa, shall we purify', This verse is q. by VKK 490 from Bhav. and by Smk 439 (from Pad.); PC ( 313-314) says that when Saturn is in Meşa (Ram), the Moon and Jupiter in Simha (Lion) and the Sun is in Sravana-naksatra then it is Mahāmāghi. Vide NS 221 for other views. This verse emphasizes the importance of Māghasnāna at Prayāga and other holy rivers and in holy tanks in early morning for the removal of sins, Vide H. of Dh. vol. IV p. 617 for Māghasnāna. In Tamil country 'Makha' is an annual temple festival and Maha makha occurs once in twelve years, when a great meļā is held at Kumbhakonam for a bath in a tank there called maha magha tank, the meļā being comparable to the Kumbhamelā at Prayāga. This festival is popularly known as 'Mamangam' and takes place when the Full Moon is in Maghānaksatra and Jupiter is in Maghā or in the sign of Lion. It fell on 23th February in 1955 according to south Indian Almanacs. It is reported that about a million people took a bath this year in eight to ten hours from 2 A. M. in the Mahamakham tank at Kumbhakopam from which muddy water was pumped out and in which fresh water from the Kāverī river was made to flow. 

It is surprising that hardly any medieval digest refers either to the Mahāmakham festival or the Kumbha meļā. The great emperor Harsa used to hold once every five years a great meļā at Prayāga on the great sandy plain to the west of the sargam on the site where the Kumbhameļā is held in modern times and distributed the 

accumulations in his treasury. Mahāmārgasirşi-Vide above under Kārtika for prefixing 'Mahā'.

VKK 500-501, VK p. 203, No. 902. Mūgha-krtya-KR 487-514, VKK 490-514, NS 213-221, SmK 

439-513, GK 37-41. There are several important yratas in Māgha such as Tilacaturthi, Rathasaptamī, Bhişmāstami which would be separately mentioned in this list. A few small matters may be briefly disposed off here. M. śu. 4 is called Umācaturthī because Gauri is to be worshipped by men and specially by women with Kunda and other flowers, with offerings of jaggery, salt, yāvaka and one should honour women who are not widows, brāhmaṇas and cows (KKN 437-38, KR 503 ); on M. kr. 12th Yama produced sesame and Dasaratha brought them to the earth and sowed them and Visnu was made lord of sesame by the gods, hence one should fast on that day and worship Hari with sesame, offer homa with sesame, donate them and eat them (V. Dh. 90. 19, KKN 435-6, KR 495-96); on M. amāvāsyā, if it is present on Monday morning, men and particularly women in Tamil country circumbulate the aśrattha tree and make 

gifts. Māghasaptami-on M. su. 7; one should bathe at arunodaya in a 

river or other running water after placing on his head seven leaves of the badara tree and seven of the arka plant; then offer arghya to the Sun with water mixed with seven badara fruit, arka leaves, rice, sesame, dūrvā, akşatas and sandal wood, bow to Saptami as Devi, then to the Sun. Some held that this snāna and Māghasnāna were not separate, while 

others held that the two were quite separate; KR 509, VKK 

· 499-502, KT 459, RM (ABORI vol. 36 p. 332, three verses ). Māghasnāna—bath in Māgha in the Ganges or in any other 

fine stream in the early morning is highly eulogised from

early times. The best time is dawn when the naksatras are still visible, next best is the time when stars are visible but the Sun is not actually risen and the inferior time is after the Sun rises. The beginning for the month's bathing should be made on the 11th of P. śu. or on P. pūrņimā (according to the pūrnimānta reckoning) and the vrata (for one month ) is to be finished on the 12th of M. śu. or pūrnimā; some bring it in line with the Saura reckon ing by providing that bath when the Sun is in Makara ( Capricorn) in Māgha in the morning leads sinners to heaven (VKK 491 quoting Pad.); all men and women are entitled to engage in it. The most meritorious Māgha snāna is at the confluence of the Gangā and Yamunā. Vide for details, Pad. VI (in which about 2800 verses are devoted from chap. 219 to 250 to the māhātmya of Māghasnāna ), HV II. 789-794, VKK 490-91, RM 1368 ( ABORI vol. 36 p. 332 ), NS 213-216, Smk 439-441 and H. of Dh. vol. IV. 617; Pad. VI. 237. 49-59 and KT 455-57 describe the procedure of the gifts and niyamas. V. Dh. 90 last verse eulogises morn ing bath in M. and Phā. Vide 1. A. vol. XI p. 88 on 'Magha 

meļā'. Mātrvrata-(1) on 8th; tithi; Mātrs ( mother goddesses ) are the 

deity; one should fast on this day and ask their pardon with devotion; they bestow welfare and health ; HV I. 876 (from Vai.); (2) on Āśv. 9th a king and members of all castes should worship the Mātrs (many enumerated) and attain success; a woman whose children don't live or who 

has a single child is blessed with progeny; HV I. 951-52. Mārgapāli-bandhana-on K. śu. 1; vide p. 205 above. Mārgaśirşakrtya-Vide KR 442-474, VKK 482-487, NS 209-211, 

SmK 427-432. The whole of the month is held sacred in the Tamil country and bhajan parties go round the whole morning; the Gitā (X. 35 ) avers that Mārg. is the best among months and identifies it with Lord Krsna. Some of the less important matters may be noted here. In Kṛtayuga the gods began the year on the first tithi of Mārg, and the sage Kāśyapa created the beautiful Kāśmira country; therefore celebration should be held on it (KR 452 ); Mārg. su. 12 a person should fast on the 12th tithi on each dyādasi for a year from Mārg. to K. and should on each dyādaśī dwell on one of the twelve names of Visnu from Keśava to Damodara and offer worship; he becomes jātismara (one

is a very ancient vrata. Inscriptions in Nāneghāt mention that queen Nāyanika (Nāganikā) in the 2nd century B. C. had performed it; vide ASWI. vol. V p. 60. This is described by Agni ( 204. 1–18), Gar. ( I. 122.1-7), Pad. VI. 121. 15-54. Agni being the briefest is summarised here.

A golden, silver or clay image of Durgā is to be worshipped, so also the weapons and symbols of royalty with mantras; there is a legend that there was a demon named Loha who was shattered into pieces by the gods and all the iron and steel in the world is produced from his limbs. Lohābhisāra means putting forth or brandishing iron or steel weapons ('Lohābhihārostrabhr tām rājñām nirājano vidhih' Amarakośa ). When a king started on an invasion the ceremony of sprinkling sacred water on him or waving lights before him was performed and that was called Lohābhisārika-karma. In Udyogaparva 160.93 we read 'Lohābhisāro nirvittah' &c. Nilakantha explains that it comprises waving of lights before weapons and invoking deities.

svara vrata (p. 277 above). It is to be performed in Bh. or āśv. on Mrgaśiras, Ārdrā, Pārvāphalguni, Anuradhā or Jyesthā; the only differences are that garments for Visou image should be yellow, the dakşiņās for Vişnu and Sankara were respectively to be gold and pearls; HV II, 593-594 (calls it Sankara-Nārāyana-vrata), KR 282–283 (both

of trees. Mat. 59 ( verses 1-20 same as Pad. V. 24. 192–211 ) contains the procedure of tree festival. It is briefly as follows:-trees in a garden should be sprinkled with sarvaușadhi water, decked with fragrant powder and flowers and cloth should be wound round them; the trees should be pierced with a golden needle (imitating karnavedha) and collyrium applied to them with a golden pencil; on the platforms of trees seven or eight golden fruits should be placed, jars containing pieces of gold should be established under the trees: homa to be offered to Indra, Lokapālas and Vanaspati; a milch cow covered with white cloth decked with gold ornaments and having horns tipped with gold should be let loose from the midst of trees; the performer (owner of the trees) should honour all priests with gifts of cows, golden chains, rings, clothes &c. and feed brāhmaṇas with a dinner full of milk for four days; homa with yavas, black sesame and mustard and palāśa fuel sticks and festival on 4th day; performer reaps all desires. Mat. 154. 512 states that a son is equal to ten deep reservoirs of water and a tree planted is equal to ten sons. It is said by Var. (172. 36-37 ) that just as a good son saves his family, so a tree laden with flowers and fruits saves its owner from falling into hell, and that one who plants five mango trees does not go to Hell; Vi. Dh. (III. 297. 13) remarks about trees' a single tree nurtured by

a man performs what a son would do in that it gratifies gods with its flowers, travellers with its shade, men with 

its fruits; there is no fall in hell for the planter of a tree.' Vrntāka-tyāga-vidhimit involves the abstention from eating 

vrntāka (fruit of egg-plant) for a life-time or a year or six or three months; fast on Bharani or Maghā nakşatra for one night; invoke the presence of Yama, Kāla, Citragupta, Mrtyu and Prajāpati on an altar and worship with gandha &c.; homa with sesame and ghee with svāhā to Yama, Nila, Nilakantha, Yamarāja, Citragupta, Vaivasyata ; 108 õhutis; gift of a vṛntāka made of gold, dark cow and bull, finger rings, ear-rings, umbrella, sandals, a pair of dark garments and dark blanket; dinner to brāhmaṇas who pronounce blessings; he who gives up vṛntāka for life goes to Vişpu loka; one who performs this for a year or a month oven does not see the city of Yama; it is a prakirnaka vrata; 

HV II. 909–910 ( from Bhay. U.). Vīndāvanadvādasimon K. śu. 12 observed in Tamil lands. Vrşabhavrata-(1) fast on 7th śu.; on 8th gift of a bull covered

Dh. III, 141. 

1-7). Veśyāvrala-HV II. pp. 541-548 (quoting Bhav. U.) deals with 

this vrata and contains the startling story narrated by Krsna to Yudhisthira that the former cursed his 16000 wives, when he noticed their erotic emotion roused by the charms of his son Sāmba, that after his death dasyus would kidnap them and the story of a prior curse pronounced by sage Nārada on Apsarases who proudly did not bow to him that they would have Nārāyana as their husband but that ultimately they would be kidnapped by robbers and become Veśyās ( prostitutes ). The long and short of this story is that they were advised to follow the profession in palaces and temples, that they should not love any male who has no wealth, but that they should have as their sole object wealth, whether the man who approached them was hand some or ugly. It is further stated that they should make gifts of cows, fields, gold to brāhmaṇas, should bathe with sarvauşadhi water when on a Sunday there is Hasta, Puşya or Punarvasu naksatra and offer worship to Kāmadeva from the feet to the head, that they should worship Cupid as Visnu, honour a brāhmaṇa learned in the Veda with gift of a prastha of husked rice grains and render their person to him on Sunday as above for a year and in the 13th month make a gift of bedstead, gold chain and an image of Kāmadeva; this is the vrata for all Veśyās; this is vāravrata; Ananga (god of love) is devatā; KKV (27-31) has this 

vrata and calls it Veśyādityavārānangadāna-vrata. Vaikunthacaturdasi-1) K. Šu. 14 is called Vaikuntha; if 

worship of Visnu is to be done it should take place at night; NS 206; (2) on K, śu. 14 in the cyclic year Hemalamba at the time of Arunodaya and on Brāhma muhūrta Lord Viśveśvara himself is said to have bathed in Manikarnikā at Banaras, performed Pāśupatavrata and together with Umā worshipped Viśveśvara and established Viøvesvara; NS 206, SmK 388-389, PC 246-247.

front foot to its tail; apply sandalwood paste to its body, wash its feet and horns with water scented with sandalwood paste and worship its limbs with Paurānika mantras; since one crosses the Vaitarapi river of the nether world by means of a cow, so this ekādaśī on which cow is honoured is so called; this yrata is for one year in three periods of four months, in which naivedya of boiled rice, of cooked barley and of pāyasa is offered respectively in 4 months from Mārg., in four months from Cai. and in 4 months from Sr.; one third of each naivedya is to be given to the cow, to the priest and to the performer; at end of one year gift of bedstead and a golden cow to the priest and one drona of iron; HV I. 1110-1112 (from Bhav.

There are several important vratas in Srāvana such as Nāgapancami, Ašūnyasayanavrata, Krspajanmāstami, which have already been described or have been included separately in this list. A few small matters are briefly men tioned here. A notion prevailed that all rivers except those that fall directly into the sea are rajasralā ('muddy' or with a pun ' in monthly course') when the Sun is in the middle of the signs of Cancer and Lion and therefore one was not to bathe in them for holiness and that streams that are not 1008 dhanus in length are not to be called “nadīs' (rivers) but they are merely holes or canals ( gartā).

When the sixth is mixed up with 5th or 7th the general rule is that in the case of vratas and fasts sixth mixed with the 7th is to be chosen except in the case of Skandasasthi where sixth mixed with 5th is to be preferred (KN 190, NA 48, SM 42, PC 100-101 ); the sixth tithi is dear to Kārtikeya (or Skanda ) who was born on it and became the commander-in-chief of the gods on it; Bhav. I. 39. 1-13, HK 622 ( quoting Brah.), KKN 382-383. 

One or two special matters may be noted. Skanda is the lord of 6th tithi and is to be worshipped on every 6th tithi with fragrant flowers, lamps, garments, crows as toys, bell, chowries and mirror; Kārtikeya is specially to be always worshipped by kings with campaka flowers and no other god ( KR 276 ); 6th of Mārg. śu. is called Mahāşasthi (HK 623-624).

described in Bhavisya (Pratisargaparva) chap. 24–29; M. M. Hara Prasad Shastri in cat. of mss in the Asiatic Society's Library, Calcutta, vol. V. preface p. LXV says that the worship of Satyanārāyaṇa (ms. No. 3370 ) has a Maha modan origin. It was originally (and even now in many places) called 'Satyapirer pūjā! It occurs in the Revā khanda of the Skandapurāņa (Vangavāsi ed.) but does not occur in the Venk. Press edition. Vide also JBORS vol. XVI at p. 328 where the same scholar says that the Mahomedan custom of offering 'Sirni' to Satyapir was adopted by Bengal Hindus as worship of Satyanārāyana. This is a vrata very popular among lower middle-class people and women. Vide 1. A. vol. 3 pp. 83-85 for stories current in Bengal about this yrata. It is said that Nārada was told about this yrata by Vişnu himself. On any day a man worships Satyanārāyaṇa and offers naivedya of 11 quantity (such as 11 ser or maund) of plantains, ghee, milk and wheat flour (or rice flour), jaggery or sugar; all these to be mixed up for naivedya ; performer should listen to the stories and partake of the prasāda; jāgara with songs, music, dance; then people go to their houses; this yields all desired objects; stories about a brāhmaṇa who performed this yrata every month, of a vendor of wood, of a trader named Sadhu with a ship full of merchandise and costly things and his daughter Kalāvati. In these stories Satyanārāyana is represented as very jealous and vindictive. The stories are said to have been 

taken from Skandapurāņa, Revā-khanda. Sadāvrata-otherwise called 'annadānamāhātmya'. HV II. 

469-475 quoting Bhay. U. wherein Krsna narrates to Yudhisthira the importance of giving food to others and refers to the words of Rāma to Laksmana that they suffered exile in a forest because of not feeding brāhmaṇas, that king Sveta suffered pangs of hunger even when in heaven and was told by Brahma that his plight was due to his not having fed hungry persons. The word literally means 'vrata (i. e. giving food ) always'. In modern times it is often pronounced and written as 'Sadāvarta' or 'Sadabarta' or 'Sadā varat'; vide Murarji v. Nenbai I. L. R. 17.

fuel-sticks; HV I. 881 ( from Bhav.). Harikūlīvrata-on 3rd tithi of Bh. śu. worship of Kāli on the 

sprouts of seven dhānyas sown in a winnowing basket; it is carried at night by women whose husbands are alive to a reservoir of water and discharged therein; HV I. 435-439 (from Bhav. U. 20. 1-28). The story is that Kāli was daughter of Daksa, was given in marriage to Mahādeva and was dark in complexion. Once in an assembly of gods Mahādeva called her as dark as collyrium. She was angered, left her complexion on a grassy plot and threw herself into fire. She was born again as Gauri and became Mahādeva's wife. The dark complexion laid aside by Kāli became Kātyāyani, who helped gods in their undertakings. The gods bestowed on her the boon that those men or women who would worship Kāli existing in groen grass would have happiness, long life and saubhāgya. The printed HV labels it Harikāli, but no question about Hari (meaning Visņu) arises here. Hari here probably simply means 'tawny' (i.e. 

Kāli who was once brown or tawny and not fair ). Harikridāśayana or Harikridayana-on K. or Vai. 12th; tithi

on this point; VKK 14 holds that Ekādasi is really the day of Hari and not dvādaśī. Gar. I. 127. 12 and Nāradapurana II. 24. 6 and 9 call Ekādasi Harivāsara; KSS 43 quotes Mat. to the effect that if Āş. śu. 12th falls on Wednesday and has Anurādhā naksatra and if Bh, šu. 12 falls on Wednes

CHAPTER XIV 

Conception of Kala 

Among the first of the great problems of philosophy is that of the nature of Space ( dik) and Time ( kāla). 

The questions that arise are: Are Space and Time ultimately real? Is the world we apprehend spaceless and timeless or has the universe a beginning in time; are Space and Time them. selves things or real, attributes or relations of things. Great divergence of views has prevailed on these problems from ancient times to this day. It is therefore advisable to indicate briefly the speculations on Time contained principally in Sanskrit works. 

The word Kāla occurs only once in the Rgveda 651 as a gambler collects the ksta (highest stake ) at the (proper) time' (Rg. X. 42. 9, Kṛtam yac svaghni vicinoti kāle'). The Atharvaveda contains two hymns (XIX. 53. 1-10 and XIX. 54, 1-5) embodying a most sublime conception of Kāla. A few striking verges 452 are translated here: Kāla (Time) carries (as) a horse with seven reins, thousand-eyed, ageless, endowed with

plentiful seed (power); the wise poets mount him (as one mounts a chariot); all worlds are his wheels (53.1); he ( Kāla) himself brought together the worlds and he himself went round (all) worlds together; being the father, he became the son of them (worlds ); there is indeed no other brilliance that is higher (or beyond) him (53.4); in Time is mind, in Time is breath; in Time is placed name; all these beings are glad by time when it arrives (53.7); Time created beings; in the beginning Kāla (created) Prajāpati; the self-existent Kaśyapa sprang from Kāla and (so did) tapus spring from Kāla (53. 10); Kāla, the son, created past and the future, from Time arose the rk (verses) and the yojus ( sacrificial formulas) were born from time (54, 3); this world and the highest world, holy worlds and holy vidhrtis having completely conquered these worlds by the brahinan Time goes on (abides) as the highest god' (54. 5). 

From these passages it appears that the word Kāla was used even in very early Vedic times in two senses, viz. time in general ( as in modern Sanskrit and modern Indian languages ) and Time as identical with the Supreme Being or the source of Creation. This latter sense, it will be shown a little later on, is also emphasized in many Sanskrit works (including the Purāņas ). 

In the Satapatha-brāhmaṇa the word Kāla is often used in the sense of time' or 'proper time '653 8. g. ‘he (Rudra angry because he was excluded from a share in offerings ) flew up towards the north at the time when sliştakirt offering was to be made' (1. 7. 3. 3 ); Prajāpati ( when cattle approached him) said 

whenever you may get anything at the proper) time or at an improper time you may eat it'( II. 4. 2. 4). 

A few passages from some of the Upanisads regarded as ancient by most scholars may be cited here; the Chān. Up. II. 634 31. 1 (while speaking of Vāmadevya Sāman and its parts ) uses the word Kāla as equal to 'end' or 'finish'. The Br. 655 Up. I. 2.4

says "He desired 'would that a second self of me were produced' ... He bore him for a time as long as a year; after that long time he brought him forth". In the dialogue between Gārgya and king Ajātasatru in the same Upanisad Gārgya put forward several objects which he reverenced (upāsana) as brahma when the king replied as to those cases in these words. Prūna ( breath ) does not leave him before the time' and 'death does not come to him before time?. Here the word 'Kāla' is used in the sense of 

proper or appointed time'. In the passage of the Kausitaki Br. that corresponds to Br. Up. II. 1.10 and 12 the words are 'neither he himself nor his progeny pass into unconsciousness before the time' and 'neither he nor his progeny dies before the time'. In some passages of the Svetāśvatara Up. some thinkers are stated to have put forward Kāla as the cause or source of creation e. g. "what is the cause ? 656 Is it Brahma? Whence are we born? Whereby do we live? On what are we established (or where are we going?)... Time or inherent nature or necessity or chance or elements or yoni (praksti) or the person, it is to be considered ( whether one of these is cause )'; 'Some sages dis course upon inherent nature ( as the cause ) while other deluded persons speak of Time ( as the cause ).' Here Kāla is represented as the cause of creation, which is the 2nd meaning of the word Kāla set out from the Atharvaveda. In another passage 657 of the same Up. Kāla is said to have been generated by Him who is intelligent and omniscient. The first meaning of Kāla ( time in general) is also found in Svetāśvatara Up. 'He (God) is the beginning, the efficient cause of (all) combinations, He is beyond the three times and is also without parts'. The Māndū. kyopanisad avers that Omkāra is beyond the threefold time viz. past, present and future 

The Maitri Upanisad 658 has a long but somewhat rambling disquisition on time ( VI. 14-16 ). It first says "Then it has been

said elsewhere 'Food is indeed the source of this whole world, and time of food; the Sun is the source of time'. Then a little later on it proceeds "Thus one has said 'From Time flow beings, from Time they reach growth, and in Time they come to dis appear; Time is a form (i. e. has definite shape or limits ) and is (also ) formless". Then it propounds "There are indeed two forms of brahma, Time and Timeless. That which is prior to the Sun is Timeless ( form of Brahma) and it is without parts, But that which begins with the Sun is Time that has parts; year is the form of the Time that has parts. All these beings are produced from the year, through the year these beings when born grow, and they disappear in the year. Therefore the year is Prajāpati, is time, is food, is Brahma nest (or abode ) and is Ātman. And it has been said "Time cooks ( ripens or digests ) all beings in the Great Self; that man knows the ( real import of) Veda who knows that in which Time is cooked". Here the Maitri Up. speaks of Time in its two senses, contains the germ of the later conception of the experience of Time as due to the actions or movements of the Sun, and refers to Time in the same terms in which the Tai. Up. (III. 1) speaks of brahma. It is unnecessary to set out passages from other Upanisads such as the Mahānārāyaṇa (XI, 14 aham-eva kālo nāham kālasya ) where Kāla is identified with God ( Nārāyana ).659 

The Mahābhārata recurs to the theme of Kāla time and again. In the Adiparva it is said "Kāla creates beings and Kāla destroys people; Kāla extinguishes Kāla that is engaged in destroying people; Kāla brings about good or evil states (or things); Kāla reduces all people and again sends them forth; Kāla is (the only one) awake when all are asleep (i. o. dead or

liberated); for Kala is invincible'. The Strīparva has the following ‘Kāla cooks all beings and Kāla destroys people; Kāla is invincible'. The Sāntiparva 660 in chapters 221 and 227 contains a long disquisition on the formidable influence of Kāla on all including gods like Indra. In the śāntiparva it is asserted 'beyond the mind is the Great Intelligence and beyond the latter, is the Great Time; beyond Time is the adorable Vişnu to whom belongs the whole world'. In another place the Santiparva, after detailing nineteen gunas the last being dvandva yoga (pairs of opposites such as pleasure and pain), remarks that the 20th guna beyond the nineteenth is Kāla and that one should know these twenty to be the source and end of all beings, The Āśvamedhika-parva describes (chap. 45) the wheel of Time in an elaborate metaphorical way (verses 1-9) and remarks that the man who well knows the action of Kāla and its sublation is never deluded and reaches the highest goal. In Vanaparva Krsna is identified with Brahma, Rudra, the Sun, the Moon, Dharma, Yama, Kāla &c. Vide for further references Sāntiparya 25. 5 ff, 224-225. 

In the Bhagavadgītā the word kāla is used in the sense of time in general or proper time' in several passages (such as IV.2, VIII. 7 and 27, VIII. 23, XVII. 20 ) and Kāla is identified with Krsna as Supreme Lord in one of his super-eminent manifestations in X. 30 and 33 (I am Kāla among those that seize and I am Kāla that is imperishable) and XI. 32 (I am Kāla, that has increased (in atrength) and that brings about the destruction of the worlds ). 

Pāṇini employs the word kāla in his sūtras many times, but in the sense of time in general or the divisions of time or proper time. Patañjali on Pāṇini III. 3. 167 ( Kālasamayavelāsu tumun) quotes a half verse about Kāla, which is the same as the one quoted above from the Mahābhārata (in note 659 ) and which appears to have been cited by Patañjali as a well-known verse. In another place Patañjali while explaining Vārtika % on Pāpini (II, 2.5) states a very important theory about Kāla.

History of Dharmaśāstra (Sec. II, Ch. XIV He says 661 "People speak of that as Kāla whereby the increases (or growths) and decreases in solid bodies are observed and the same (time) is called day and night when conjoined with some activity. What is that activity? (the reply is): the motion of the Sun. When that (motion of the Sun) is repeated again and again there is a month and a year'. This means that Kāla does not exist except as a convenient name or word for the manner of measuring change or becoming in what we observe by comparing one series of changes with another. 

In the Manusmrti the Supreme 662 Lord is said to have created time and its divisions (I. 24 Kalam kalavibhaktisca) and to have, after He produced the universe, disappeared in himself again and again, squeezing one period of time by means of another period (I. 51). 

Coming to the philosophical systems, it may be noted that the Sānkhya system does not include Kāla as a separate tattva in its twenty-five tattvas. But Kala was not altogether forgotten in that system. The Sankhyakārika 663 states that the karanus are thirteen, three being abhyantura (internal i. e. inside the body ) and ten being banya; the latter are concerned with the present, while the former are concerned with the three times (past, present and future). 

The Vaišeşika-sūtra treats 664 Kala as included in the nine dravyas ( substances, I. 5) and states that the indications of the

662. आत्मन्यन्तर्दधे भूयः कालं कालेन पीडयन् ॥ मनु. I. 51, The idea is that creation is destroyed by the time of pralaya, as Kullika says 'सृष्टिकालं मलयकालेन नाशयन्.'

existence of Kāla are the apprehensions of a thing as posterior or prior, the apprehension of simultaneity of certain things, the apprehension of a thing as lasting long or as being momentary, that it is nitya, one and the (efficient) cause of all things that are created. Prasastapāda gives the instance of an old man and a young man being seen by a person in one place and direction or in different directions, who apprehends after looking at a young man that another man called old differs from a young man as regards a grown-up moustache or beard, wrinkles on the body and baldness and so apprehends that the old man is remote from the young man and therefore apprehends him as beyond (para) while he thinks of the young man as near, posterior and so apura. 

There were certain philosophers who held that Time is either past or future and denied that there is present time (vartamāna). The Nyāyasūtra refutes this view and holds that time is either past, present or future (II. 1. 39-43). From Patañjali's 665 Mahābhāsya it appears that even in his day there were philosophers that held that there was no time called present and that those people quoted certain verses in support. 

The Nyāyamañjart 666 of Jayantabhatta (K. S. S. 1936 ) has a long discussion on Kāla. It first sets out the views of those who deny the very existence of Kāla as a separate entity. These latter say that Kāla is not perceptible like a jar &c. and that

(Sec. II, Ch. XIV 

the ideas of quickness or slowness depend merely on the observed effects. The same theorists raise the further objection that if Kāla is a dravya (substance) that is all-pervading and per manent, as the Vai eşikas assert, then how is it that Kāla is spoken of as past, present and future. To these objections some reply: Kāla is directly perceived, since it appears to the mind as distinguishing the various perceptions of effects, that the soveral experiences such as these matters happened simultan eously, this happened after long, this happened quickly' cannot be perfectly explained if one denies the existence of Kāla and holds that these experiences depend solely on the perceived objects or actions. Others hold that Kāla is really inferred and not directly perceived. They argue: merely because Kāla is not directly perceived it does not follow that it does not exist; to infer that Kāla exists is proper as it is proper to infer that the other side of the moon exists though we see only that face of the moon that is below the earth; therefore Kāla exists as a separate entity to which is due the common experience of simul taneity, quickness or slowness &c. The differing observations about persons being young or old cannot be well explained with out admitting the existence of Kāla, which like ākāśa is one, all-pervading and permanent. To the objection how, if Kāla is one, all pervading and nitya, it is spoken of as having three divisions, the reply is: in reality there are no divisions in Kāla, but divisions are imagined in Kāla on account of the upādhi (a limiting or restrictive adjunct ) viz. kriyā (activity ). When we speak of a man as cooking rice in the present (odanam pacati ), that is due to the distinguishing nature of the result (boiled rice) which is brought about by several activities ( kriyās ) beginning with the placing of the cooking pot on the fire up to its being taken down on the ground. Then we use the word present'. But when we bear in mind the series of activi ties that produced the boiled rice we use the expression "he cooked' ( in the past tense ) for the activities that have ended. In this way we speak of time also as past on account of the dis tinguishing characteristic of the activities that have ended. 

It may be noted that Raghunātha on 'Padārtha-nirūpana' (a work of Navyanyāya school) held the view that Space, Time

Kāla in Yogasūtrabhāeya 

471 

In the Yogagūtrabhāsya on III. 51 there is a brief but very interesting and abstruse disquisition on Kāla. The sūtra runs 667a 

• by constraint (sainyama) upon moments (ksana) and their sequence ( or succession) (arises) knowledge due to discrimina tion'. The bhāsya explains : just as an atom is substance or matter ( draiya ) reaching the limit of minuteness, so a kşaņa (moment) is time that reaches the highest limit of minuteness, or a ksana (moment) is time taken by an atom in leaving the posi tion in space it occupies or the time taken in reaching the next point in space; krama ( sequence) is the non-cessation of the flow of moments; moments and their succession do not form a collection ( or combination) of actual (or perceptible) things. Muhurta ( 30th part of day and night ), day and night and others are combinations made by the mind (or by mental con ceptions). This time, though devoid of being a real thing by itself, is indeed only a creation of mental conceptions and results from knowledge derived from words ( alone ) and appears as if it were an actual object to ordinary people whose doct rines are divergent (or confused ). But ksana (moment) falling among (i. e. being mixed up with ) real perceptible things appears ( to the human mind) as dependent on or constituting sequence (or succession ). Krama (sequence) is of the nature of uninterrupted succession. This sequence is called Kāla by 

Yogins who know (the real nature of ) time. For, two ksanas cannot exist together (simultaneouly ). It is inipossible that there should be a sequence of two moments that exist simultane ously. When a later moment comes after an earlier one without interruption, that is called krama. In the present there is only one moment and there are no earlier and later moments in the present. Therefore there can be no combination of two moments (in reality ). But those moments that have passed away and those that are yet to come are to be interpreted or described as

connected with the ( constant) flux of changes (in the world). Therefore the whole world experiences change in each single moment. So all these ( external) aspects of the world are de pendent on one moment ( in the present). 

This disquisition shows that the Yogasutra and its bhāsya held that time was not a dranya and not a tangible reality, but that it was merely a word, a mental concept inseparable from the perception or experience of physical objects as a characteri stic (višesana or upādhi), that it attaches itself to the changing realities, that we measure it according to the movements of or changes in things and that it was not merely like a hare's horn. 

I have confined myself to Sanskrit works and particularly to works of the Vedic school type. €63 Buddhist and Jaina thinkers had to say a good deal on Kāla. For example, the Pramāna669-vārtika-bhāsya or Vārtikālankāra of Prajñākara gupta (about 700 A. D.) combats the view of the Vaišesikasūtra and Prasastapāda ( quoted above) and holds that there is no separate entity like Kāla, that it is not possible to have the ideas of distant time and near time if Kāla be without beginning and be endless, that the ideas of being distant or near or quick are not distinct from the activities about which they are predicated. This Buddhist view practically amounts to saying that time is not a thing, but only an idea, only a subjective condition of human sensorial experiences and intuitions and is non-existent in itself, apart from the subject. On the other hand Jaina 670 writers hold that there are six parlārthas viz. jiva, dharma, adharma, ākāśa, pudyala and kāla i, o, Time has separate existence. 

668. It is surprising that in the two volumes of the History of philo sophy, Eastern and Western,' published under the auspices of the Govt, of India (London, 1952), and compiled by an Editorial Board presided over by such a world-famous philosopher as Dr. S. Radhakrishnan, not a word is said about the conception of Time in the Vedic Literature and in the Vaiseșika and other systems and only a meagre account is given of the Buddhist and Jain ideas on the subject (vol I. pp. 159, 175–76 and p. 144).

Kāla in the Purānas 

473 

Some of the Purāņas contain disquisitions on Kāla. The nature of Time is described in the Kūrmapurāņa as follows: This adorable 671 Kāla is without beginning and without end, it is ageless and immortal; it is a great Lord because it is all-em bracing, it is independent and is the self of all; there may be many Brahmās, Rudras and Nārāyaṇas and other gods. It is declared that the divine Lord is one and is omniscient and is Kala; they ( the gods) are created by Kala, which again swa llows (or makes them disappear); the gods Brahma, Narayana and Isa (Siva ) are said to undergo prākrta disappearance by the power of Kāla and also spring again therefrom as highest Brahma, the elements, Vasudeva and Sankara. Therefore the whole world has its soul in Kāla. He alone is the highest Lord.' The Visnudharmottara 672 has a similar long disquisition on Kāla the gist of a few verses of which may be set out here 'Kāla is without beginning and without end, it is Rudra that seizos all (or it is Sankarsana); it is called Kala because it carries off or drives all beings. Kāla is great and the highest Lord, because it is beginningless and endless; it is more subtile than the wink ing of one's eye, very much more subtile than the subtilest. Its *subtileness cannot be understood even by Yogins. When a thousand lotus leaves are pierced by a needle ignorant people think that the piercing of all leaves is at the same time, but really the leaves are pierced at separate units of time. This is the subtileness of Kāla. But though Kāla is very very subtile, it is also great and measurement of it can be computed because of the motions of planets.' The Vāyu and Kūrma both say 'Time creates beings and again destroys them; all are under the rule of Time, while Time is not under the dominance of

any one.' The Visnupurana 673 holds that Brahma which is one. unborn, permanent, ageless appears in the form of Kāla, which is without beginning or end. The Bhāgavatapurāņa 674 also regards Kāla as inferred in regard to its minuteness and its grossness is all-pervading, and holds that it is supposed to have units from the subtlest (atom) to the highest... 

Among astronomical works the Sūryasiddhānta states 675 'Kala is the destroyer of worlds; another (kind of time) is of the nature of calculation; Kāla is of two kinds, gross and subtile, which are also called murta (physically apprehensible ) and amarta ( not so apprehended); (the divisions of ) time called prāpa ( respiration) and the like are mūrta, while truti and the like are amūrta.' The Caraka-samhitā676 includes Kāla among nine dravyas and holds that it is acetana (non-sentient). Thus it agrees with the Vaišeşika viow. In the Suśrutasambitā it is declared 'Kala is indeed self-existent, without beginning, middle or end; the poverty or richness of substances that have ( one or 

more of the six ) flavours (rasas) and the life and death of human beings are dependent on Kāla. It is called Kāla because it does not remain sticking to even the smallest division or because it heaps together (beings by leading beings to death ) or drives them together. Of that adorable Kāla which assumes the character of year, the divine Sun produces by his special move ments the divisions called twinkling of the eye, kāsthā &c.

Kāla in grammatical works 

475 

Similarly, philosophical grammarians like Bhartrhari 677 ( author of the Vākyapadiya) holds that Kāla is a substance (dravya), all-pervading and permanent apart from activities, that it is the efficient cause of all created things, that it is divided into years, seasons &c. on account of the different activities, just as the same man may be called a carpenter or a blacksmith &c. (on account of his different activities ). For reasons of space it is not advisable to pursue the subject of the nature of time from other Sanskrit works of medieval and modern times. For those who desire to make a further study of this subject I would recommend the 'Kālasiddhānta-darsini' composed and published by Shri Haranchandra Bhattācārya of Calcutta in 1941, which exhaustively deals with the philosophical conceptions about Kāla held by different sects, schools and Sanskrit writers. 

There is a great temptation to compare Indian ancient and medieval conceptions about Time arrived at more than a thousand years ago with similar or corresponding conceptions on the same subject in modern Western philosophical works such as Kant's 'Critique of pure reason', Prof. S. Alexander's 'Space, Time and Deity '(1927, London, two volumes ), 'Time and Western Man' by Wyndham Lewis (London, 1927), Pierre Burgelin's 'L' Homme et Le Temps' (1945), Bergson's Time and Freewill', S. G. F. Brandon's 'Time and Mankind' (1953). But as this volume has already grown to large proportions, comparisons with Western philosophical views have to be given up. 

From very ancient times minute divisions of time have been mentioned. The Vāj. S. states 678 'that all winkings of the eye (and similar units of time) were produced from the (supreme). Person that is brilliant (like lightning). This half verse occurs in the Mahānārāyaṇa Upanisad also. It is stated in the Bṛ. Up.679 that under the dominion of this imperishable brahma the Sun and the Moon are held apart, as also nimeşas, muhurtas, days, and nights, half months, months, seasons, and years stand apart

History of Dharmaśāstra 

(Sec. II, Ch. XIV 

The Mahānārāyana Upanisad' (I. 8-9) mentions as units of time ‘Nimesas, Kalā, muhūrta, kāşthā, ahorātra, half months, 

months, rtus, year. Manu I. 64 provides that 18 nimesas are equal to kāşthā, 30 kāşthās to kalā, 30 kalās to muhūrta, 30 muhūrtas are equal to one day and night. Early and very exhaustive enumeration of the several units of time from subtlest to the highest are contained in Brhat-samhitā of Varāba and in the bhāsya of Prasastapāda on Vaiśesikasūtra 680 viz. “Kāla is the cause of the popular usage about the units being kşaņı, lavi, nimeşas, kāşthā, kalū, muhūrta, yāma ( prahara or Ath of a day), ahoratra (day and night), ardhamāsa (half month), māsa ( month), rtu ( season), ayana, samvatsara (year), yuga, manyantara, kalpa, pralaya and mahapralaya. The Puranas also dilate upon the units of time from nimeşa to pralaya or kalpa. Vide Brahma 231, 6-12, Kūrma I. 5. 6-14, Padma V.3.4-20, Vāyu 57.6-35. Nimesa (lit. winking of the eye) is defined by the Vayu and Visnudharmottara as the time required for pronouncing a short letter and the latter adds that a smaller unit than it cannot be (physically ) apprehended. There is great divergence of views about the number and names of the minute units of time and their mutual relations. A few examples alone can be cited. Manu (I.64) furnishes the following table : 18 nimesas=kāstha, 30 kāsthas = kala, 30 kalas = muhurta, 30 muhurtas ahoratra ( day and night). The Arthasastra. 681 of Kautilya provides : 2 trutas (i?)= lava, 2 lavas = nimesa, five nimesas == kastha, 30 kāsthās = kalā, 40 kalās = nādikā, % nādikās = muhūrta, 30 

muhurtas = ahoratra. Some of the puranas contain the same 682 verge on the names and relations of small units of time viz.

15 nimesas = kāsthā, 30 kāsthās = kalā, 40 kalās = nādikā, 2 nādikās = muhūrta, 30 muhūrtas = day and night together. It should be noticed that here the relation of nimesas to kāştha is different from that in Manu and Kautilya The Arthaśāstra 683 of Kautilya does not stand alone in speaking of truta ( ? i) as the smallest unit of time. The Sūryasinddhānta ( quoted above) provides that truţi is the smallest unit of time, that it is amurta (not apprehended physically ), that the prāna is the first mūrta (physically apprehended) unit of time, that 6 prānas are equal to a vinādi, that 60 vinādis are equal to a nādikā, 60 nādis are equal to an ahorātra. Utpala 631 on Br. S. quotes verses from Paulisa-siddhānta and Brāhmasphuţa-siddhānta to the effect that six prāņas are equal to a vinādikā, 60 vinād ikās are equal to a nādikā or ghatikā and 60 ghatikās are equal to a day (i. e. ahoratra ). A smrti quoted in the Tithitattva states that two trutis make a lava, 2 lavas make a nimesa, so that truti is equal to įth of nimeşa. Hemādri on Kāla (p.7) quotes a verse that truţi is equal to two nimesas and 10 trutis are equal to prāņa. The Amarakośa follows Manu as to eighteen nimesas being equal to kāşthā, but it introduces a unit called kşaņa between kalā and muhūrta, so that its scheme is : 18 nimesas - kāşthā, 30 kāşthās = kalā, 30 kalās = ksana, 12 ksanas = muhūrta, 30 muhūrtas = ahorātra. The Bhāgavata-purāņa (III. 11. 3-10) puts forward a far more elaborate scheme : two atoms (of Time ) = aņu, 3 anus = trasarenu, 3 trasareņus = truți, 100 trutis = vedha, 3 vedhas = lava, 3 lavas = nimeşa, 3 nimesas = kşaņa, 5 ksaņas = kāsthā, 15 kāşthās = laghu, 15 laghus = nādikā, 2 nāļikās = muhūrta, 30 muhūrtas = ahoratra. In the Atharvaņa-jyotisa the table is: 12 nimeşas=lava, 30 lavas=kalā, 30 kalās = truti, 30 trutis = muhūrta. This agrees with none. Further units of time from ahorātra to pralaya will be dwelt upon a little later. 

Before proceeding further clarification is required on certain points. At least several centuries before Christ Jyotisa had attained the position of being one of the six angas ( auxiliary

studies ) of the Veda. The Mundakopanişad 685 states that the aparā vidyā ( inferior exoteric knowledge ) comprises Rgveda, Yajurveda, Sāmaveda, Atharvaveda, Śikṣā ( Phoneties), Kalpa (ritual texts ), Vyakaraṇa (grammar), Nirukta (Etymology ), Chandas ( metrics ) and Jyotişa ( astronomy and mathematics ). The Āpastamba-dharmasūtra enumerates the same six angas of the Veda. In the Pāṇiniya Siksā 686 the science of the move ments of heavenly bodies is said to be the eye of the Veda. The Jyotisa which is Vedānga (of the Rgveda and Yajurveda ) was concerned with purely astronomical matters. In the Vedānga Jyotisa 687 it is remarked : 'the Vedas arose for the purpose of (use in ) sacrifices; sacrifices are enjoined according to the order of times; therefore he who knows Jyotişa which is the science laying down the (proper ) times knows sacrifices. Just as a tuft of hair stands on the head of peacocks or a jewel (in the heads ) of cobras, so ganita ( astronomical calculations) stand at the head of all the sciences that are (spoken of as) Vedāngas'. This shows that the words Jyotisa and ganita are used as synonyms in the Vedānga-jyotisa. The Vṛddha-vāsişthasiddhānta ( Benares S. Series ) says 'this śāstra is indeed the eye of the Veda; therefore, among the angas (limbs, subsidiary lores of Veda) it has got pre ominence; a man endowed with all other limbs and therefore appearing to be perfect is worth nothing, if he is devoid of eyes.' Gradually, however, Jyotisa came to include three distinct bran ches (skandhas) viz. the determination of the motions of planets by means of calculations which was called Tantra, the second called horā that deals with horoscopes and (was also called jātaka) and the third called Sakhā which was an extensive branch and included many topics of divination which are summarised

Branches of Jyotişa 

479 

in Br. S. chap. II. A work embodying complete presentation of the three branches was called sarnhitā 688 and he who well knew the three branches, viz. Ganita, Hora and Sakha. was called, as Garga says, 'Samhitāpāraga' (master of samhita ). Varahamihira689 himself tells us in the Brhaj-jataka, that, for the benefit of astrologers, he compiled a comprehensive work on Jyotisa in its three branches. The word Samhitā appears to have been used in two senses, the first690 (a wider sense) referring to a complete presentation of Gapita, Horā and Sākhā, while the second (a narrower sense) refers only to the Sakha. part. Why the third branch was called śākhā is not satisfactorily explain ed anywhere. It was so called probably because it had to deal with numerous circumstances, such as the fruits of the simple and retrograde movements of planets; the movements of Agastya ( Canopus) and saptarsis (Ursa Major), the conjunc tions and oppositions of planets, haloes, meteors. earthquakes, lore about the movements and cries of birds, nirājana, removal of the evil effects of utpūtas. In this sense samhitā was what is called natural astrology.

against an enemy derived from the tithi, naksatra, the week-day, the muhurta, the moon's position, dreams, throbbing of limbs, the cries of birds, and rivāha i. e. examining the horoscopes of the parties to a marriage ( called Vivāhakāla or Vivāhapatala ). 

The usual practice of the Grhyasūtras and Dharmaśāstra works was to take their astronomical requirements and know ledge from astronomers. The Gobhila-grhyasūtra691 provides: 'the work on this point is separate; one should study it or should obtain information about ( the exact time of) the parvan (New moon and Full moon) from those who know it.' The astronomical knowledge of ancient and medieval India has been a subject riddled with acute controversies. Somewhat reluctantly I have come to the conclusion that discussions about the theories and practice of astronomy in ancient and medieval India should be omitted from the History of Dharmaśāstra. An adequate treat ment of ancient and medieval Indian astronomy and dis cussion of the theories advanced by Western scholars (some of them quite unwarranted) would require a large volume by itself. Here and there I may have to refer to pure astronomical matters for certain purposes. But the two other branches of Jyotisa, viz. Horā (astrology ) and Sākhā have exerted a vast influence on Dharmaśāstra and will have to be discussed within limits. Though Dharmaśāstra writers took their astronomy from astro nomers, they did not hold that astronomers had the last word, but they rather hold that if there was some conflict or contra diction between strict astronomical theory and Dharmaśāstra, the latter was to prevail. An example may be cited for illu strating this: Suppose that a man has resolved to undertake 

ekabhakta-vrata' on 7th tithi. The sankalpa for a vrata is aß a general rule to be made in the morning. Suppose that 7th is mixed with 6th and 8th tithis and that 7th commences about 10 A. M. on a certain week-day; then according to Yugmavākya (vide p. 75 note 191 above) 7th mixed with 6th is to be preferred for the vrata and the sankalpa would have to be repeated in the morning when according to correct astronomical calculation the tithi might be only the 6th at that time. Deyala declares that a tithi is, for the purposes of religious bath, gifts and vratas, to be regarded as covering the whole day if the Sun sets during the

period 692 of that tithi. Vide Krtyaratnākara p. 299 and Smṛti kaustubha ( on tithi p. 12 ) for other examples. 

About Astronomy and Astrology as developed in India Western scholars such as Weber, Whitney, Thibaut have pro pounded many sweeping and unwarranted theories based on flimsy data. Here and there I may have to refer to them. But I must say in one place how and why their conclusions are often unacceptable. In the first place, they do not attach due importance to the fact that a vast literature in Sanskrit has perished beyond recovery (as it is admitted was the case in Greece after Ptolemy composed his Almagest ) 693 and what we now have is a mere fraction of what once existed. In the second place, they forget or ignore that much of the literature that survives is religious and not intended to be a historical and full treatment of any topic i. e. most of the references to astronomical matters found in the Vedas and Brāhmaṇas are not made of set purpose but are incidental or casual. They hardly seem to be aware of the rule of caution and common sense that in ancient literature what is expressly stated may be used for drawing inferences, but the non-mention of certain matters cannot necessarily be a valid reason for arriv ing at the conclusion of non-existence, unless the subject matter was such that if something connected with it existed it should ordinarily have been mentioned. Further, and most important of all, mere similarities in institutions, usages and other matters should not be regarded as evidence of borrowing by one people from another people. Human mind is the same everywhere, its environment and the needs of human beings are often the same and no people, ancient or modern, can be regarded as having had the monopoly of great intellectual powers. Most of those who wrote on Indian literature and subjects in the 19th century were nurtured on the literature of the Greeks and Romans and on the vaunted superiority of the ancient Greeks in Philosophy, Mathematics, arts and other matters and of Egypt. But as ancient cuneiform tablets in Babylonia and the Middle East countries came to be deciphered, things began to be seen in

proper perspective. Modern scholars have, it is refreshing to note, outgrown the stage when all arts were traced to Greek (see "Sumerians' by Sir Leonard Woolley, 1928 p. 193, Glanville in *Legacy of Egypt' p. 160 for the debt the Greeks owed to Egypt). Sir Thomas Heath was obliged to admit that the debt of the Greeks to the Babylonians was much greater than had been imagined.694 Sarton in a History of Science' (London, 1953) has to say that it is childish to assume that science began in Greek (Preface p. IX). It has been found that the Greeks were inferior to the Babylonians in several respects, that their vaunted geometric lore was not as great intellectually as supposed, that out of 200 propositions in Euclid's twelve books only about a dozen are necessary as a preparation for modern mathematics and that the Greeks much developed geometry because they could not easily employ ordinary arithmetical methods owing to their dependence on the abacus. 695 It was further found that the sexagesimal system of degrees, minutes and seconds used by Ptolemy was of Babylonian origin and according to Herodotus (II. 109) the Greeks derived two kinds of Sun-dials and the division of the day into 12 parts from the Babylonians.696 At present such nations as England, France, Germany, U. S. S. R. and U. S. A. are the foremost nations in Science, Technology and Industry but they clung for about 1400 years to the Alma gest of Ptolemy as their astronomical Bible, were ignorant of the decimal place value system and the use of a sign for zero till the so-called 'Arabic numerals' (borrowed from India ) were

introduced into Europe. The intolerance of ignorant and bigoted priests in Europe went so far as to condemn Galileo, one of the greatest intellects in mechanics and astronomy, to por petual imprisonment at the age of 70 for no greater offence than holding fast to the Copernican theory. Hardly any parallel to such an attempt to suppress honest difference of opinion as regards heavenly bodies can be found in any non-European country claiming to have a civilization. 

There are controversies about the relation of astronomy and astrology. The marvellous spectacle of the sky at night con taining thousands of stars of different brightness all apparently in motion"round the earth, the Sun's annual northward and south ward passage in the sky, Full Moon and its disappearance for one day and its phases, eclipses of the Sun and the Moon, comets and falling stars--all these must have struck even the most primitive men with wonder and also with fear and fore bodings. In course of time arose astronomy and astrology. In ancient times both words had the same meaning. The Cambridge Ancient History (1925, vol. III. pp. 238-239) holds that the whole science of astronomy is due to astrology. On the other hand Prof. Neugebauer and Mr. Peter Doig see no evidence for this theory.698 In my humble opinion if we restrict ourselves to existing literatures of different peoples and eschew more con jectures and speculation, both astronomy and astrology are equally ancient and must have acted and reacted on one another in very ancient times. In the following pages some evidence will be given from Vedic literature of the simultaneous cultiva tion in India of both astronomy and astrology (particularly natural). To a modern scientist, the lucubrations of astrologers in their available works appear to be sheer nonsense. But the fundamental principle assumed by astrology that heavenly bodies

exert predictable influence on terrestrial things and persons is not different from the principles of astronomy or meteorology whereby one can predict tides, eclipses, storms, torrential rains, and the like which affect the world and human beings. 

Whether the stars and planets exert some influence on earthly things is not the real question. Probably they do, but the really important question is whether astrological works and astrologers have discovered correct methods and reached correct knowledge about the influence of planets on the human mind and on the day-today activities of human beings. 

The astronomical and astrological literature in Sanskrit falls into three slightly overlapping periods. The first period is that of the Vedic Samhitis and the Brāhmapas from the mists of antiquity to about 800 B.C. The second is represented by the Vedāngajyotisa, the Srauta, Grhya and Dharma sūtras, Manu and Yājñavalkya, Garga and Jain works like the Sūryaprajñapti and ended about the 3rd century A, D. The third period begins at the commencement of the Christian era and is represented by the works called Siddhānta and gave rise to the works of Arya bhata (born 476 A. D.), of Varāhamihira (about 475 to 550 A. D.), Brahmagupta (born in 598 A. D.) and so on. Those who want to make a deep study of the History of Hindu Astro nomy should carefully read the work in Marathi written by Shankar Balkrishna Dixit in 1896 (2nd edition in 1931 by his son). Even Thibaut who is generally chary of praising any Indian achievement in astronomy was constrained to observe that Dikshit's work is the richest source of Indian astro nomical material and that his treatment from Brahmagupta onwards is particularly detailed (Grundriss, p. 3). Dikshit held that the scientific system of Indian astronomy is essentially independent and rests on Indian observations. In my humble opinion this view is far sounder than the view that the scienti fic astronomy of India was derived from or was greatly influen ced by Greek astronomy. I have decided (as stated above p. 480) not to enter into detailed discussions about astronomical matters. Therefore, I shall rest content with mentioning some of the important works and contributions that should be studied by those desirous of intimate knowledge of the History of Indian Astronomy.

CHAPTER XV 

Units of Kāla 

We shall now turn to the units of time from yuga back. wards to muhūrta, leaving aside Manvantara, Kalpa and Pralaya for the moment. 

The word 'yuga' occurs at least 33 times in the Rgveda and appears to have been used in several senses. Vide H. of Dh. vol. III. p. 886-890. Two senses stand out as prominent, viz. a short period or a very long period. For the first sense we may cite Rg. I. 158. 6 ( 'Dīrgbatamas, the son of Mamatā, became old in the 10th Yuga, he became brahmā high priest and leader of the waters flowing to their goal'.699 Here yuga cannot mean a period of more than ten years and probably means a period of five years; in Rg. III. 26.3 we read 'like a neighing horse by its mother, Vaiśvānara ( Agni) is kindled by the Kuśikas in each yuga'; vide Rg. 111.55.18.700 In the Vedāngajyotisa 701 (verses 1 and 5 ) yuga is said to comprise five years. There is nothing to prevent us from taking this sense in the two passages cited from the Rgveda. In Rg. III. 55.18 it is possible to recognize a recondite refer ence to five year units of time each divided into six seasons. In the Rgveda samvatsara means a year in several passages such as I. 110. 4, I. 140.2, I. 161. 13, I. 164. 44, VII, 103. 1, 7, 9, X. 190.2. In Rg. X, 87. 17 we have the derivative form 'Samvat saripa '702 from samyatsara 'O Agni that observest what men dol May the demon possessing magic devices not partake of the cow's milk that springs after a year'. In Rg. X. 62.2 we have

the word parivatsara 'those ancestors that shattered Vala by righteousness and forced out the wealth consisting of cows' and in Rg. VII, 103.8 the word 'parivatsarīņa: Samvatsara and Parivatsara are two of the five names bestowed on the five years of a yuga in the other samhitās. Just as the word yuga was used in several senses even in the Rgveda it is quite possible that the words 'samvatsara' and 'parivatsara' meant simply year and also successive years of a cycle of five years. In the Tai. S. (V. 5. 7. 1–3 ) namaskāru ( salutation) is offered to Rudra with Samvatsara, to his bow towards the right with Parivatsara, to his bow behind with Idāvatsara, to the bow towards the north with Iduvatsara and to the bow above with Vatsara. The Vāj. S. ( 27. 45 ) names these five separately with Idā vatsara in place of Iduvatsara; similarly, in Atharva VI. 55.3 salutation is offered to Idāvatsara, Parivatsara and Samvatsara. In Tai. Br. (1. 4. 10.1 703 ) Agni, Aditya, Candramas and Vāyu are identified with Samvatsara, Parivatsara, Idāvatsara and Anuvatsara and it should be noticed that the four names of years are brought in close relation to the four cāturmāsyas, viz. Vaišvadova, Varuņa praghāsa, Sākamedha and Sunāsiriya. Thus even in the Samhi tās names (generally five ) are mentioned in a certain fixed order. There is no reason why this should be so unless they formed a fixed series in a cycle. Thibaut in his Grundriss (p. 9) hammers on the fact that sometimes only two or three or four out of the five are mentioned and argues (rather obstinately ) that knowledge of the five year yuga cannot be assumed for the Vedic times. It should be noted that Kautilya speaks of the yuga of five samvatsaras and of the insertion of two intercalary months, one at the end of 21 years and the other at the end of 

five years. 704

History of Dharmaśāstra 

(Soc. II, Ch. XV 

The Mahābhārata knows of the yuga of five years 705 (in Sabhāparva 11. 38). The Pitāmahasiddhānta, 7:6 which is not extant now, stated, according to the Pañcasiddhāntikā of Varāhamihira, that yuga means five years of the Sun and the Moon and that an intercalary month was added after thirty months. 

The next question is: what was the extent of the year in the Vedic age. Some Rk. verses may be cited in this connection. 

• The wheel 707 of sta has twelve spokes; it revolves round the heavens; it does never wear out. O Agnil in this ( wheel) seven hundred and twenty sons in pairs abide. Some say that the father (Sun) who sends down water has five feet and twelve forms and remains endowed with fulness in the distant half (part) of heavens while others say that he ( the Sun), the all-seeing, is placed in a lower ( place) that has seven wheels and six spokes; all the worlds abide in the revolving wheel with five spokes; one wheel and twelve rims ( of the wheel) and three naves-who is there that knew these ( thoroughly ); in that ( wheel i. e. year) are placed together three hundred and sixty very unstable nails' (Rg. I. 164. 11-13 and 48 ). In these passages the sage poses a riddle or puzzle in very metaphorical and mystic language about a year divided into three, five or six seasons, twelve months, 360 days and 720 days and nights (when calculated separately ). It is possible to hold that the wheel of rta means the zodiacal belt

The whole hymo Rg. I. 164 is full of riddles. In Rg. I. 164. 2 it is said that seven borses aro yoked to a chariot (the Sun) that has only one wheel but three naves. The wheel means the year, tbree daves would be three seasons, summer. ralos, winter. The wheel is also said in verses 12 and 13 to have six spokes or five spokes; the twelve spokes or rims of wheel (pradhi) represent months.

divided into twelve parts ( dvādaśāra ). But it is a very difficult matter to keep in view the twelve divisions correctly. In Rg. I. 164. 15 it is said 'They say that the 7th of those that are born together is born of one; there are only six twin sages born of the gods'. Here there is a reference to seasons, six of which have two months each, the 7th has only one ( viz. 13th or intercalary month ) and that the 13th month is not fit for religious rites. The Atharvaveda V. 35. 4 708 also states that samvatsara has twelve spokes and the months have 30 spokes. This explains Rg. I. 164. 11-13 and 48. In the Brahmanas also the year is said to have 360 days and 720 days and nights together; Satapatha IX. I. 1. 43, Ait. Br. VII. 7 also say the 709 same. We have also to recognize that the Vedic saṁhitās and Brāhmaṇas speak of a 13th month that was intercalated. About Varuna the Rgveda says 710 'He knows the twelve months with their progeny (the days ) and also the month that is added.' The Tai. S. (IV. 6. 7. 1-2) refers to a year of twelve months and also of 13 months. The Kausitaki Br. 19. 2 speaks of the 13th month. The Tai. S. ( I. 14. 4, VI. 5. 3. 4 ) expressly mentions the 13th month called ' Samsarpa or Amhaspatya'. It is called Amhasaspati in Vaj.s, (VII. 30 and XXII. 31) and Samsarpa in Maitrāyani S. III. 12. 13. The Kausitaki Brāhmana connects the 13th month with the Sunāsiriya sacrifice. 11 The Maitrāyani Samhita (I. 10.8) draws a distinction between a stuyāji and cāturmāsya-yāji, the former being one who offers sacrifice thinking 'now Vasanta has started, rainy season has started, śarad has started while the

In six such years about 6 days for each year appear to bave been calculated and added as a 13th month of 35 days.

Cāturmāsya-yāji is one who offers sacrifice in view of the 13th month'. 711a How and when the month was inserted in the Rgveda times or the times of the Tai. S. is not clear. What is clear is that one whole month was added. Therefore, Thibaut overstates the case when he asserts emphatically (Grundriss p. 7) that all Vedic texts agree that the year was exclusively of 360 days. A year in which one month was added ( i. e. of 390 days) was also well-known to the Řgvedic Indians. Therefore, in order to explain the facts we have here probably to postulate two calendars, ons a purely sacrificial (or religious) of 360 days (12 months of 30 days ) probably inherited by the Vedic Indians from their ancestors about whom we know next to nothing, and another calendar where a month was added in order to bring the year in line with visible astronomical data. It is known that the ancient Egyptians 712 had an official calendar of 360 days ( 12 months of 30 days each ) plus five days added at end i. e. of 365 days only and no intercalary day was inserted in a year. The result was that the opening day of this calendar would shift back through the solar year until a whole cycle of that year had been completed in 1456 or 1506 years. This calendar called sliding calendar was in use for about 3000 years in Egypt from proto-dynastic period until the Roman period. There was also another calendar against which this sliding calendar moved. A year of 360 days ( divided into 12 months of 30 days each ) was not peculiar to ancient Vedic India nor to ancient Egypt, but played an important role also in Mesopotamia, which had a strictly lunar calendar. The co-existence of months of various

Length of months in Vedic times

lengths for later times is vouchsafed by the Arthaśāstra p. 108 (Sham Shastri's ed. of 1919 ). A year of 360 days was in later times in India called a Sāvana one (from 'savana' meaning extracting of soma juice in a sacrifice ) and a month was added after about 30 months to bring the lunar year (of 354 days) in line with the solar year. 

In the Satapatha Brāhmaṇa (II. 1. 3. 2.) 713 the Sun's apparent passage for six months in the north and for six months in the south is referred to, though the word ayana is not employed in this passage. The word 'ayana' occurs in the sense of 'motion or path'in the Rgveda (āyan-n-āpo ayanam-icchamānāh, Rg. III. 33.7). Uttarāyaṇa and Dakşiņāyana in later literature mean no more than the sun's ( apparent) motion or path in the northern celestial sphere and in the southern sphere respectively. The Sun's movement in the north for six months and in the south for six months is mentioned in Br. Up. VI. 2. 15-16 also. Thibaut (Grundriss p. 10 para 6 ) cites Kausitaki Br. 19. 3 as stating that the Sun stands still after it has gone for six months towards the south in order to turn again to the north and then observes that no one has a right to assume, from this statement in the Kausitaki 714 Br. that for six months the Sun goes north or south, that the halves of the year are to be understood. What Thibaut is driving at is not clear to me. We have in this passage six months passages of the Sun in the north and also in the south. A year has ordinarily only twelve months. Therefore it must be assumed that halves of a year are meant. Thibaut does not explain what part of the year these six months in the north and south correspond to. Thibaut is probably swayed by the fact that in the Satapatha and elsewhere Vasanta, Grīsma and Varsā are lumped together as the seasons (rtus ) for the gods but Uttarāyaṇa does not exactly correspond with these three stus. That may be so, but the rule or maxim is that names are given on the basis of what is principal or eminent prādhānyena vyapadeśā bhavanti). Vasanta and Grişma are important parts

of Uttarāyaṇa; therefore, by association with these two and for the sake of symmetry varşā is also held to be a rtu for the gods. 

As regards the seasons, there are varying statements. In Rg. I. 15 the word 'stunā' occurs several times, but once we have * Itūn' also 'O Indra'drink Soma according to the seasons from the wealth (i. e. the richly filled vessel) of the brāhmapa.' Rg. II, 36 and 37 are styled Rtavya hymns. The Rgveda itself names five seasons, viz. Vasanta (X. 161. 4, X. 90.6), Grīşma (X. 90.6), Prāvșs ( VII. 103.3 and 9 ), Sarad (over 25 times, as in II, 12, 11, VII. 66.11, X. 161.4), Hemanta ( X. 161.4), but the Rg. does not expressly mention Siśira. Three seasons are meta. phorically meant in Rg. I. 164. 48 and six in Rg. I, 164. 15. The Atharvaveda 714a ( VI. 55.2 ) mentions all the six, but not in the usual order. The Ait. Br. says that the year has five rtus 7 by putting together Hemanta and Siśira. The Maitrāyaṇi Sam, in I. 7. 3 speaks of Samvatsara as having five rtus and again as having six ftus and the Sat. Br. (II. 1.3.16 ) says that sam vatsara comprises six rtus. In Satapatha XII. 8.2.33 the ftus are said to be three viz. Grisma, Varsa and Hemanta and in the very next passage they are said to be sis. There is mention of seven stus in Atharvaveda VI. 61.2. But one should not be puzzled by this. The 7th ftu is probably meant to represent the 13th intercalary month as it is expressly mentioned in Atharva. (V.6.4). Thibaut surprisingly asserts that the lists of the names of the seasons are only priestly inventions and the Vedic texts exhibit no practical use for them (Grundriss p. 11). Thibaut appears to be obsessed with the influence of priests and offers no good reasons why the names should be regarded as inventions and not as correctly registering what was current in the then society. In Tai. S. 716 IV. 4.11.1 the six rtus with two months for each are mentioned. Vasanta is mentioned as the first of rtus (mukham vā etad-rtūnām yad-vasantaḥ) in Tai. Br. I. 1.2.6. The Satapatha 717 provides that Vasanta, Grişma

Vedic references to seasons

and Varsā are the seasons of gods, Sarad, Hemanta and Sisira are seasons of the pitrs; similarly the bright half of a month, the day and the forenoon of a day are the times for gods and the dark half of a month, the night, the afternoon of a day are the times for pitrs and it winds up with the prescription that a brāhmaṇa should consecrate the sacred fires in Vasanta, a ksatriya in Grīsma and a vaiśya in Sarad. 718 At least as early as the edicts of Asoka the words 'varsa' (which etymo logically means 'rains') and 'samvatsara' are both used in the same sense viz, a year in the Brahmagiri inscription ( vide C. 

I. I. I. p. 175). 

There are Western scholars that deny the knowledge of the planets to the Vedic Indians. But Thibaut (Grundriss p. 6) and Kaye (p. 33 ) both concede that it is inconceivable that the Vedic Indians did not observe and distinguish at least the larger planets in early times, but they contend that the Vedic passages cited as proving knowledge of the planets on the part of Vedic Indians cannot be accepted as evidence of the record of observations about planets and that the mere mention of the number soven or five ( about Adityas in Rg. X. 72. 8-9 or oxen ) cannot be relied upon. Both Thibaut and Kaye approach these problems with a peculiar mentality. Their criticism is mainly destructive and has a flavour of special pleading against things and ideas Indian. They hardly ever propose their own explana tions of the disputed passages and when they rarely do they do not show how their explanations are more satisfactory than the ones they criticize. One typical case may be cited here. Almost all scholars agree that Krttikās are the same as Pleiades; but Kaye (Archaeological survey memoir No. 18 p. 24 and I. A. vol. 50, P. 45 ) appears to doubt this, yet he has not the goodness to say positively what other cluster Krttikās stand for and why. The principal reason for the paucity of references to planets probably

I demur to this conclusion. lo some passages tbe meaning of rtu would have to be 'season.': for ex. ample in Rg. I. 49,3 "O fair Usas !' winged birds, two-footed ( beings ) and four-footed (animals) go forth according the several seasons from the ends of the sky for thee (to meet thee)' (ar Taragott fyrto i 59 Since feats FTTETTII).

is that the cult of the worship of planets that we find well deve loped in Yāj. I. 295–308 had not yet arisen in Vedic times. At least Bṛhaspati (Jupiter ) appears to be clearly meant in two Vedic verses. 'Bṛahaspati, 719 first appearing in the highest heaven of the great Luminary ( the Sun), destroyed darkness &c;' 'Bșhaspati, when first appearing, rose in front of Tisya (Pusya ) constellation'. 'The seven 720 priests guard the dear and fixed seat of the bird (Agni) along with the five adhvaryus; oxen, going eat, ageless, delight in the east; the gods follow the ordi nances of gods' (Rg. III. 7.7.). Here the (five) oxen are taken to be the five planets. Similarly, 'He (Indra ) filled heaven and earth and the mid-region; he superintends in various ways the five gods, the 49 gods ( Maruts) at the proper seasons together with the thirty-four lights similar to his own but each accordiug to the different ordinances governing each'721 ( Rg. X. 55.3); 'these five oxen that stand in the midst of the great heaven' (Rg. I. 105. 10). Vena 722 may betaken to be the brilliant Venus in Rg. X.

The five gods are the planets that do not appear all at once but according to their respective seasons (F4-7:). The 34 lights are the San, Moon, the five planets and 27 naksatras, Ludwig and Oldenberg accept this interpretation. No other satisfactory explanation of 34 has been given by any one.

This would be a fine description of Venus rising in the east at dawn. 

About months a good deal would have to be said later on. The word is either 'mās' or 'māsa'. We have mās' in Rg. I. 25.8, IV. 18. 4, X. 52. 3 'He (Agni) appears every day and every month' and we have ‘māsa' in Rg. III. 31.9, V.78.9 (may the boy lying in the womb of his mother for ten months come out alive &c.), X. 184. 3. 'Mās' (the measurer) also means the Moon, as in æg. VIII. 94.2, X. 12,7 ( 'sūryo jyotir-adadbur-māsyaktūn,' the gods placed light in the Sun and darkness in the Moon), X. 64.3, X. 68.10, X, 92. 12, X. 93.5. The words 'mās' (moon) and 'māsa'(month ) are Indo-European, as variants of the same occur in many languages of the so-called Aryan family of languages. 

Naksatras have been a matter of serious discussions in numerous works. The word Naksatra' has in all three senses (1) star in general; (2) 27 equal parts of the zodiac; (3) asterism in the zodiacal belt ( which may each consist of one or more stars ). In my opinion the first and the 3rd are the most frequent meanings of the word in the Vedic samhitās. It may be that the zodiacal belt was divided into 27 equal parts called naksatras, but the easier, more natural and probably the earlier way was to mark some conspicuous star groups like Krttikās, Mrgaśiras and to refer to them as naksatras. The word 'naksatra' occurs frequently in the Rgveda and the other Samhitās and Brāhmaṇas; "the naksatras like thieves go away along with

nights ( to make room ) for the Sun that sees the world'723 (Rg. 1. 50.2); 'May the earth, the heaven, the waters, the Sun along with the naksatras and the wide sky listen to us' (Rg. III. 54. 19); 'he (Varuņa ) urges on in two ways the big and high heaven ( the Sun) and naksatras and also spreads the earth' (Rg. VII. 86.1); 'when he ( the Sun) comes up, naksatras are not seen in the heavens, no one knows truly (how this happens )' Rg. X 111.7; 'The Adityas are strong through Soma, the earth is great through Soma and then Soma is placed in the lap of these naksatras' ( Řg. X. 85.2). In some passages like Rg. VII. 81.2 and X. 88. 13, it is difficult to say what 'naksatram 'stands for. Nakşatra in most of the above passages means a star in general. But in Rg. X. 85.2 and in X 68.11 (the pitrs adorned the heavens with naksatras ) 723a naksatra appears to mean the 27 well-known asterisms. So also when the Satapatha contrasts the Krttikās ( that do not swerve from the east) with other nakşatras (that do swerve), naksatra should be taken to mean asterisms in the Zodiacal belt, the 27 (or 28 ) constellations in the Zodiacal belt in which the moon appears to move. Another word is ' str' (that is an Indo-European word), which always occurs in the instrumental plural in the Rgveda (as in I. 68. 5, 1. 87. 1, I. 166. 11, II. 2. 5, II. 34. 2, IV. 7.3, VI. 49. 3 and 12 ) and is often con nected with decking the sky. The word 'rksa' in the sense of * star' occurs in Rg. 724 I. 24. 10 'these řksas that are established high up (in the sky ) are seen at night, but where did they go by day'. This refers to the constellation of the seven sages (Ursa Major). In the Atharvaveda VI. 40. 1, the constellation of the seven sages is expressly mentioned: "May Heaven and Earth confer on us freedom from danger here; may the Sun and the Moon do the same for us; may the wide mid regions confer on us freedom from danger and may there be abhaya for us on account of the oblation offered to the Seven Sages". The Satapatha states that the seven sages were formerly called 'řksāḥ' ( note 727 below). In Rg. V. 56. 3, VIII, 24, 27, VIII, 68. 15 the word rksa means either 'bear' or something else. It has been pointed out above p. 494 that in Rg. X.55.3 there is a reference to twenty-seven

naksatras.725 Apart from that the Rgveda mentions the naksatras Tisya ( as above) and Aghā and Arjuni 726 ( in Rg. X. 85. 13) which two latter correspond to Maghā and Phalgunis according to the Atharvaveda. It is possible to hold either that Agha and Maghā were names for the same nakşatra in Rgvedic times or that Aghā was changed to Maghā by the time of the Tai. S. and the Atharvaveda hymns. If the latter alternative be accepted the change in the names of the two naksatras ( Agha and Arjunī) could not have taken place in a short time, but would require at least a hundred years between the time of Rg. X.85 on the one hand and Tai. S. and Atharva 19.7 on the other. This would strongly militate against Max Müller's assignment of two hundred years to the Samhitas which are purely hypothetical and the minimum dates ( vide Intro. p. XV to the 4th volume of his 4 volume ed. of the Rgveda ). Apart from Aghā and Arjuni which it is agreed are two of the 27 nakşatras, it is probable that the Rgveda refers to Mrgaśiras, Punarvasu, Satabhişak and one or two more by name. The Nakşatras are 27 or 28 (adding Abhijit after Uttarā 

725. For a myth about the disappearance of Abhijit from the list of naksatras, vide Vadaparva 230 2-11. There it is said tbat Abhijit, the younger sister of Rohini, coveted the position of eldership and went to a forest for practising tapas. Skanda was approached by the wives of sages, says Mārkandeya, and he said that he would consult Brahma. Then Brabmā arranged that time began with Dhanisthā and the Krttikās went to the heavens. This has been interpreted by modern writers on ancient Indian Astronomy to mean that the verpal equinox happened to be in the Kșttikās before the time of Yudhisthira and that Abhijit was accepted as one of the Dakşatras. Vide J. of Ganganatha Jha R. I. vol. XIII at pp. 82-84 (by Prof. T. Bhattācbārya). With the greatest respect for the learned writer, I cannot accept all this. Discussion of his theory has to be given up for reasons of space.

sādhā and before Śravaņa in ancient authorities ). In the Vedic literature, Vedāngajyotisa and even in Yājñavalkya-sirti they are enumerated from Krttikā to Apabharani ( or Bharani ) while in works from the 3rd or 4th century A. D. and in modern times they are enumerated from Aśvini to Revati. 

It is time now to set out in a list the names of naksatras, deities governing them, their gender and the number of stars in each. There is some divergence of views as regards the names and the deities, which will also be pointed out in the appended table: complete lists occur in Tai. S. IV. 4.10. 1-3, Tai. Br. I. 5 and III. 1, Atharvaveda XIX. 7. 2-5, Kāthaka Samhita 39.13, Maitrāyaṇi Samhitā II. 13,20 and Vedānga-Jyotisa. For European equivalents of the Indian naksatras, vide Colebrooke in Asiatic Researches vol. IX chart opposite p. 322, Dikshit's Marathi work (2nd ed. p. 459 ) and Burgess in J. R. A. S. for 1893 p. 756. It is not unlikely that there is a veiled reference to Reyati, Punarvasū and Puşya naksatras in æg. X. 119. 1-3728, and Rg. X. 86.22 appears to refer 729, as Tilak says in 'Orion'p. 166 ff., to the Mrgasiras naksatra; ‘Vrşākapi 10 Indra! when you dashing upwards came to the house, where was that Mrga guilty of a good deal of sin, to whom did that Mrga, that confounds people, go? Indra is superior to all'. From Rg. I. 161.11 and 13 and IV, 33.7, Atharvaveda IV. 11.11 it appears that the dog-star (Sirius ) is referred to, and that twelve days were added at the end of the year during which the Rbhus slept or took rest or enjoyed the hospitality of the Sun.730 In Rg.

rājan bhisajaḥ sahasram' it is possible to see a reference to the Satabhisak naksatra of which Varuņa is said be the devatā in the Tai. Br. III. 1, especially as in the following verse (ami ya řksā nihitāsa uccā ) there is a special reference to the Great Bear or to nakşatras in general. 

Some remarks on the oakşatras in general and on individual gaksatras would not be out of place. In the Atharvana Naksatrakalpa (the first of the Atharvaparisistas edited by Bolling and Negelein ) in chapter 4 verses 1-8 the devatās (deities) of the naksatras are given and chap, 2 states the number of stars in each nakșatra. In some Puranas also such as the Vişnud harmottara (J. 83. 13-21) the presiding deities of paksatras are set out. In the Bțhat-sambitā Varāhamihira (chap. 97. 4-5) specifies the deities of the naksatras from Ašvini to Revati (including Abhijit ) as noted below. The Bṛbat-sambitā (96. 1-3), the Atharvaņa-naksatra-kalpa (1, 2) and the Visnud barmottara (I. 88 4-7) specify the number of single stars in each naksatra (which are from one to six ), those baving six stars being Krttikā, Āśleşā and Magbā. Vide JASB, vol. 62 part 1 p. 14 where Hoernle gives a table, from a ms, of Puşkarasāri's work, of Daksatras, the stars in each, the muhurtas, the gotra, devata of each. According to Hoernle the work is very old. Some notes are added on individual paksatras ( mentioned in the Vedic works ). Krttika-The Tai, Br, III. 1.4. 1 specifies the names of seven Kșttikās as Ambā, Dulā &c. Panioi refers to Ksitikā as Bahulā (in IV. 3. 34). J. C. Hickey in 'Introducing the universe' (pp. 119 120) says tbat persons of unusually keen 731 vision under favourable atmos. pheric conditions can see even eleven. Mrgasira-Tai. Br. III. 1. 4. 3 mentions both names viz, Mrgasirsa and Iovakā. Punarvasū—In the Kathaka and Mai. S. this is masculine singular ; Panini states (1. 2. 61 ) that in the Veda the word 'Punarvasu' is employed optionally in the singular (i. e. 

(Continued from last page) after having slept you asked this 'O Agohya (the Sun who cannot be cop: cealed by any one)! who is here that awakened us? The goat (the Sun) replied that the dog was the awakener at the end of year and that this was announced that day.' Tilak in Orion' (pp. 168 ff) explains at great length the meaning of these verses. Though one may not agree with every thing that he says, his main contentions seem to be probable.

sometimes in the dual, sometimes in the singular). Kālidā sa employs the dual Punarvasū ja Raghuvamsa XI. 36'gām gatāviva divah Punarvasū.' 

Tisya-Panini uses the word Tisya in I. 2. 63 and 3. 34 and the words Puşya and Sidbya in the sense of 'on which undertakings prosper or succeed.' 

Phalguni-Pāṇini provides that the words Phalguni and Prosthapadā as naksatras are optionally used in the dual or plural, 

Nistya---Mai. S. shows that this is Deuter singular. Nistya in Rg. VI, 75. 19, VIII, 1, 13, X 133.5 appears to mean' outsider or outcaste', 

Visakha-Panini (I. 2. 62) provides that in the Veda 'Visakhā' is sometimes used in the singular, sometimes in the dual, wbile in bis day it was used in the dual. 

Anuradha-The mantra in Tai. Br. III. 1,2, 1 appears to use it as masculine plural. 

Rohini-Jyesthā is called Robini in Tai. S. and Tai, Br, (1,5). Jyesthā is styled Jyesthagbai in Atbarva VI. 110. 2. Vide note 753 below. 

Mula-In Tai, S, Vicrtau is used for Mūla, The Atharvaveda brings together Victau and Jyesthaghai in VI. 110. 2-3 and bas "Vicrtau dāma tārake' in II. 8, 1 and VI. 121. 3. In Rg. X, 87, 10 (tridbā nūlam yātudha pasya vȚśca ) Mūla means 'root, foot'. The word 'Mūlabarbana' occurs in Atharva VI, 110.2 and Mūlabarhani in Tai. Br. I. 5. 1. 4. 

Abhijit--not mentioned in Tai, S. and Kāthaka, though mentioned in Tai, Br., Atharva and Mai. S. It is sometimes mentioned in later works e. g, the Anušāsanaparva ( 64. 5–35 ) mentions the consequences of gifts to brāhmaṇas on 28 naksatras from Kșttikā to Bharani. 

Śrona-Atharva calls it Sravana and Kathaka speaks of it as Aśvattba. In Pāṇini IV. 2. 22 Aśvattha is mentioned as a paksatra, The word Sroga in Rg. I, 112. 8 means 'lame or cripple'. 

Prosthapadā --Atharvaveda speaks of 'dvayā Prosthapada'. 

It would be noticed that some of the names of nakşatras differ such as Inyakā (in Tai. Br. 1.5.1 and Kāthaka ) for Mrga śīrsa, Bāhū for Ardrā ( in Tai. Br. I. 5.1, Kāthaka S. and Maitrā. yani S.), Tişya for Pusya, Nistyā for Svāti (in Tai. Br.), Rohiņi ( in Tai. Br. I. 5.4 and Tai. S.) for Jyesthā, Victau in Tai. S. for Mūla ( in other Vedic texts ), Sronā (in Tai. S., Tai. Br. and Mai. S.) and Aśvattha in Kāthaka S. for Śravana (in Atharva. ), Sravisthā for (medieval and modern ) Dhanisthā, Apabharani for Bharani (in Atharva., Mai. S. and modern times). The deities also differ, the most striking being the change of place between Bhaga and Aryaman as presiding deities of Āsādhās in the Kāthaka, Vedāngajyotisa, San 8!.. and Indra as deity of Citrā in Tai. S. and Tyastr in Tai. Br.

and Kathaka S., Pitarah as deity for Mūla in Tai. S. but Nirrti in almost all other texts; Indra as deity of Satabhisak in Tai. S. and Maj. S. but Varuņa in Tai. Br. (III. 1.) and Kāthaka. Further, it was also specified whether a naksatra had only one star or had a cluster of two or three or more. Besides, the important point for consideration is; why does the Tai. S. differ from the Tai. Br. and Tai. Br. I. 5 from Tai. Br. III, 1 in the number of naksatras, in the names and the deities also of some of them. No satisfactory explanation can be given except this that the Tai. S. passage is earlier by some centuries than the Tai. Br. section (III. 1) or the Tai. S was composed in a country far away from the place where the Tai. Br. was composed. This latter does not appear to be probable since one part of Tai. Br. (1. 5) differs from another part (III. 1). The latter section speaks of a nakşatra-isti in which oblations are offered to 28 naksatras ( including Abhijit ) and their deities (one naksatra being dealt with on each day from Krttikās) together with puronurūkyūs ( invitatory verses ) and yājyās (oblation verses ) which are different for each naksatra. The first fourtoon naksa tras from Kṛttikā (up to and including Viśākhā) are called Devanaksatras and the fourteen naksatras from Anūrādhā to Apabharaṇi or Bharani are cālled Yamanaksatras. After Viśākhā, the Tai. Br. (Naksatresti) inserts Paurņamāsi with appropriate puronuvākyā and yājyā verses and after apabharani an offering to Anāvāsyā with a puronuvākyā (which is the verse 'Nivesani sangamani vasūnām' Tai. S. III. 5.1.1) and a yājyā ( which is the verse "yat te devā adadhur', Tai. S. III. 4. 1. 1). Besides, it was laid down that the sacrificer had to invoke gods in the sacrifice by a name ( to be kept secret) derived from the presiding deity of the naksatra on which he was 732 born ( i. e. if 

732, a dar eta gaur TTÁTOTI YHAFFT stratafa Ho tra il at vir verse 28. Western scholars usually ascribe the Vedāāga Jyotisa to about 400 B. C. For example, 'L' Inde classique' edited by Prof. L. Renou and others, Tome II. para 1711 assigos, after saying that the date is undeter mined, 400 B, C as its probable date. I should like to place it pot later than 8th century B.C. for several reasons. If the observation referred to above (p.496) about krttikās were made about 12th century B.C. (14th century B.C. as some scholars hold) and if 400 or 300 B.C, was accepted as the date of the Vedangajyotisa, it would have to be supposed that the writer of it either did not notice (or purposely ignored ) the fact that winter solstice had shifted about 11 or 12 degrees from the originally observed position. This is rather difficult to believe A difference of four or five degrees may not be dwelt

born on Kṛttikā, then some name like Agnimitra &c., if on Pusya, Brhaspatinitra &c.). 

If the naksatras ( 27 or 28 ) had been borrowed at one time en bloc from a foreign source the divergences in the names of the naksatras, in the presiding deities, and in the gender and number should ordinarily not have arisen to the extent they do. But, if they were an indigenous growth then differences of opinion would naturally have been evolved in the passage of centuries. The only asterisms first specialised and named in Greece and Syria were the Pleiades in Job. 38. 31, Homer and Hesiod; Orion in Job. 39.31, Homer and Hesiod; Arcturus in Job. 9.9 and in 39.32, Homer and Hesiod; the great Bear in Homer and Hesiod, Aldebaran in Homer and Hesiod and three more including Sirius (videDawn of Astronomy' by Norman Lockyer, 1884 p. 33). This is several centuries later (if not thousands) than the early Vedic texts wherein the whole scheme of naksatras appears. 

Further details contained in the Tai. Br. and Baudhāyana śrauta-sūtra ( 28, 3–4 ) are not set out here. The Naksatresti in the Tai. Br. (III. 1 ) has been competently dealt with by Prof. Paul Emile Dumont in the Proceedings of the American Philoso phical Society, vol. 98, No. 3 ( 1954 ) with text, English transla tion and notes. The naksatras had been closely observed and many legends arose from imaginary resemblances of star groups to certain familiar animals and also fanciful interpretations of the constellations observed in the sky. The naksatras were closely concerned not merely in a religious rite called Nakşatresti, but they were of prime importance in the basic srauta rite, viz. consecration of the sacred fires (Agnyādhāna). In the Satapatha Brāhmaṇa (II. 1. 2 ) reference is made to several naksa tras from Kittikā onwards together with their presiding deities as being fit for Agnyadhāna (viz. Krttikā, Rohini, Mrgaśīrsa, Pūrvā Phalguni, Uttarā Phalguni, Hasta, Citrā). The Tai. Br. recom monds spring, summer and sarad for Agnyādheya in the case of 

(Continued from last page) upon. Besides, the facts that the Baudhāyana-srauta-sūtra has a similar passage, that Kautilya follows the five year cycle and says that there is ad intercalary month at the end of 27 years and another intercalary month at the end of the cycle of Ave years (11.2 on p. 109 ) and the fact that the Mahābhārata (Virātaparva 52.3-5) speaks of adding two intercalary months every five years rather suggest an earlier date for the Vedānga-Jyotisa. Vide Swamikanou Pillai's 'Indian Ephemeris' vol. I part I. p. 448 ff for discussion on the probability of the antiquity of the वेदाङ्गज्योतिष.Nakṣatras and Agnyādheya

brāhmana, ksatriya or vaiśya sacrificer respectively. The Satapatha appears to condemn setting up of sacred fires in relation to naksatra alone and recommends that Agnyādheya should be performed on the New Moon of Vaišākha on which there is Rohini naksatra ;732a but these rules did not apply when a person had resolved upon performing Soma sacrifice and he should not in that case stop to consider the season or naksatra 

Very interesting information and legends are given in the Vedic texts about some of the naksatras. About the Křttikās the Satapatha Brāhmaṇa733 states other naksatras contain one star, or two or three or four stars, but these Kșttikās are many; the sacrificer reaches plenty; therefore one should set up sacred fires on the Krttikās. These ( Krttikās) indeed do not swerve from the east, while all other naksatras do swerve from the eastern direction.' The recondite allusion in Rg. I. 164, 33 (atra pitā duhitur-garbham-ādhāt) and X. 61.7 (pitā yat svām duhitaramadhiskan) are developed into a myth, a lengthy account of which is given in the Ait. Br. XIII. 10 and Satapatha I. 6. 2. 1-4 (Prajāpati approached his daughter, some say the heaven and others say it was Uşas &c.) and about Rohini, Mrga, the Mrgavyādha (Sirius) and the three stars in the belt of Orion.

Why the naksatra lists begin with the Krttikās in the Vedic Literature and why with Aśvini in classical Sanskrit literature can be explained only on astronomical considerations. The ver

nal equinox was in Křttikā about 2300 B. C. Instead of admit ting this as a probable date for the Vedic works, Fleet boldly asserts that the list of naksatras beginning with Krttikās has no basis in fact, but belongs entirely to ritual and astrology (JRAS for 1916 p. 570 ). No detailed arguments are deemed necessary. Fleet does not specify cogent evidence, nor does he assign reasons why priests later on changed the beginning of the list from Krttikā to Aśvini, nor does he vouchsafe how the list of naksatras in the Vedic age began in fact for ordinary folk if the Křttikā list was a pure priestly invention. Even Thibaut (in I. A. vol. 24 at p. 100 ) had to admit that the begin. ning of the naksatra series with Krttikā instead of with Aśvini seriously affects Max Muller's assignment of 1500 B. C. to 800 B. C. to the Vedic period. In the Tai. S. VII. 4. 8 there is a discussion about the time for undergoing the diksā in a Sāmvat sara-satra'. 735 It is proposed there that the dikşā may be performed on the Full Moon in Phalgunī because that is the beginning of the year; then an objection is raised against this and it is pro posed that the dikşā may be taken on Full Moon in Citrā, because that was the beginning of the year. If the year began with the winter solstice in those days this reference would have to be placed at 4000 or 6000 B. C. This passage probably embodies traditions that the year began in different months in different periods of antiquity. 

Great controversies have raged over the question whether the Indian naksatras are indigenous or were borrowed from some other people. The great French astronomer Biot held that Indians borrowed the naksatra system from the Chinese and Whitney followed Biot. There were others who held that Indians borrowed thom either from the Babylonians or the Arabs. I cannot enter here into the merits of these discussions. The Arabs them selves admit that they borrowed their astronomy from Indian Siddhantas and there is hardly anything to show that they know the complete naksatra system as early as at least 1500 B. C. Therefore, we may leave the Arabs out of account altogether ( vide Thibaut in Grundriss p. 14). Great scholars are often blinded by prejudices and shut their eyes to basic facts. The Chinese system of Sieu had at first only 24 and then it became one

of ( it is said ) 28 at about 1100 B. C. ( as said by Thibaut in Grundriss p. 13.) There are no clear traces in the Vedic texts that nakşatras were held to be ?during the times of those texts. We should not accept at their face value the assumptions of the antiquity of astronomy in China that are sometimes advanced (vide' East and West', Rome, vol. VI. p. 288.) Besides, neither in Babylonia nor in China were the asterisms thoroughly integrated with the religious system. In Vedic times one was not entitled to perform solemn sacrifices unless he had already set up sacred fires on certain naksatras. Further, the months (Māgha, Phālguna, Caitra &c.) were named after certain naksatras and exist only in Sanskrit, not in Greek, Latin or Chinese. The deities that were deemed to preside over the naksatras from such ancient days as those of the Tai. S. and Tai. Br. are almost all of them exclusively Vedic and have no counter parts in Babylonia or China. Besides, though thousands of cuneiform tablets have been found in Babylonia no one has, so far as I know, pointed to a single tablet where all the naksatras appear in an orderly series of 27 or 23, as we find in Vedic Samhitās. It is at least clear that long before the Taittirfya Samhitā the Vedic people had fixed the number of the naksatras (at 27 or 28 ), their names and order and their presiding deities and had made the naksatras a most integral part of their sacri. ficial system. Furthermore, almost all of the Indian names of naksatras are siginficant or have ancient legends connected with them. For example, Ārdrā means 'wet'and the naksatra was call od Ārdrā because when the sun was in it rains set in. Punarvasu was probably so called because the grains of paddy or barley sown in the ground sprout up as new wealth after being buried; Pusya, was so called because the young sprouts grow and become nourished;Ā.śreşā or Āślosā, because the grown-up plants of paddy or barley grow high enough to embrace each other; Maghā, be cause the paddy or other plants are putting forth the standing crop which is wealth in itself; Krttiki, because they (being six or seven ), look like the skin of the spotted deer on which a religious student was to sit for Vedic study. In these circum stances the burden to prove borrowing of the nakşatra system by Indians was very heavy on those who affirmed it. What is the evidence? There is very little evidence except prejudice and speculation. The main tangible evidence they can and do rely on is that the Chinese or Babylonians had also 28 paksatras as the Indians had. But these scholars, though very learned and far seeing in their own way, never stopped to consider how from 

510 

History of Dharmaśāstra 

(Sec. II, Ch. XV 

China and Babylon the naksatras could reasonably be supposed to have been derived by Indians more than 3500 years ago (on a most modest estimate) and allowed to be the very centre and basis of their religion of sacrifices, what were the means for the communication of the thoughts and ideas underlying the naksatra system and why one may not surmise that the real state of things was the other way about (viz. the Babylonians and Chinese derived the system from the ancestors of Indians ) or that all systems were derived from a common prehistoric source. Another reason for discounting the theories of Biot, Weber and Whitney may also be advanced viz. the researches of Tilak in his 'Orion' (particularly pp. 61-95) and of Prof. Jacobi have at least made this clear that the Krttikā series is not the oldest arrangement of the naksatras known to Indians, but that the Indians had once an older arrangement, which plac ed Mļgaśirsa at the vernal equinox. Those who are interested in these somewhat novel and rather barren controversies raised by Biot, Weber and others may read Weber's 'der vedischen Nachri chten von den Nakşatras', two volumes, I. A. vol. 23 pp. 154-159 (Jacobi on the date of the Rgveda'), pp. 238–249 (Bühler's note on Jacobi's theory and Tilak's Orion, 1. A. pp. 85-100 (Thibaut on ‘antiquity of Vedic civilization') and pp. 361-369 (Whitney), I. A. 48 pp. 95–97. The word 'naksatra' is derived by Yaska 736 from the root 'nakş' meanicg 'to go', while the Śatapatha Br. (II. 1. 2. 17-18) and Tai. Br. II. 7. 18 derive it as from na plus kşatra and Panini (VI. 3.75) accepts this derivatior. The word 'naksatra'(m) is applied even to the Sun in Rg. VI. 67. 6. Tai. Br. teaches how one is to mark the naksatra on which one has to perform a religious act, viz. he should mark about dawn and before the first rays light the sky the part of the sky where the naksatra appears and when the sun appears the nakşatra would be to the west of the sun, at which time he should perform what he has to do. It is stated that sage Matsya established into eminence Yajñesu and Satadyumna by this method (Tai, Br. I. 5. 2.1.).

indeed never sets nor rises. When people think that he (the Sun) sets what happens is he reaches the end of the day, reverses himself, creates night below and day above. When people think that he rises in the morning, that means that having reached the end of the night he reverses himself, makes day below and night above. He indeed never sets'. This is in very interesting contrast to the Jaina view in Sūryaprajñapti of two suns and two moons or the viow of Heraclitus in Greece ( 6th century B. C.) that a new sun was born and died every day ( Eisler p. 42.)

I have purposely devoted some space to the subject of the astronomical knowledge of people in the Vedic age. Several European scholars that have written on the astronomical achievements of ancient and medieval India, have indulged in very disparaging and contemptuous statements about Indians

not only in astronomy, but generally. To take only one or two instances. Thibaut (Grundriss p. 3 ) is pleased to observe that what Indians knew before Greek influence is not much and is of a primitive character. This is how Whitney, a learned American scholar of Sanskrit, unburdens himself; 'there can be no question that, from what we know in other respects of the character and tendencies of the Hindu mind, we should not at all look to find the Hindus in possession of an astronomical science possessing so much of truth. They have been from the beginning distinguished by a remarkable inaptitude and disin clination to observe, to collect facts, to record, to make inductive investigations' (J. A. O. S. vol. VI p 471). His coadjutor, Mr. Burgess, differed from him even in regard to astronomy (ibil. pp. 477–480 ). 

One is tempted to return Whitney's compliments to Indians in the same coin by saying that for 1400 years from Ptolemy, the ancestors of Whitney and other highbrows hardly ever made any discovery of astronomical importance, stuck unthinkingly and slavishly to the Almagest and were literally in the dark about the true astronomical position during what are often called the Dark Ages of Europe. Even Luther who rebelled against the authority of the Pope denounced Copernicus as a fool, charged the latter with turning upside down the science of astronomy and relied upon the Bible, which, he said, declared that Joshua commanded the Sun to stand still and not the Earth (Joshua 10. 12). This betrays the old mentality that if there is a contradiction between the words of the Bible and Nature, the believers in Scripture must correct their ideas of Nature in accordance with the Bible and not the Bible in accordance with what is found to be Nature. This also reminds one of the maxim of the Pūryamimārsā that there is nothing too heavy for a sacred text. 

I should request all Western authors interested in Indology and dazzled by some writings of a few Greeks to ponder deeply over the following words of Sir Norman Lockyer in his 'Dawn of Astronomy' (1894) 'Anaximander told us that the earth was cylindrical in shape and every place that was then known was situated on the flat end of the cylinder; and Plato, on the ground that the cube was the most perfect geometrical figure, imagined the earth to be a cube, the part of the earth known to the Greeks being on the upper surface. In these matters the vaunted Greek mind was little in advance of the predecessors 

Unpardonable omissions by Western writers 

513 

of the Vedic priests' (p. 8). If the Greeks forged ahead in one or two branches, there were several other peoples in the world that far surpassed them in other equally important matters. I would also recommend to them to read carefully what Sarton says in his Preface (p. IX) to 'A history of Science' where he charges Western writers with unpardonable omissions viz. ignoring the scientific efforts of Egypt, Mesopotamia and other countries and assuming childishly that science began in Greece and secondly hiding the superstitions which surrounded eminent Greeks. Writers at least in the 19th and 20th centuries should have no reason to run down one people and praise to the skies another people, but their endeavour should be to arrive at well documented, well-balanced, impartial and cautious judgments upon the achievements of ancient peoples of the world. 

The chronology of the Vedic age is far from certain. Jacobi, Dikshit, Tilak and some others would put the Vedic age back to 4000 B. C. or even earlier. Winternitz puts it as far back as 2500 B. C.; while Max Müller and following him many Western scholars would thrust all Vedic Literature between 1500 to 800 B.O. Even taking these latter timings the Vedic Litera. ture shows a good deal of progress in astronomical matters which Indians could not have owed to Greece. There is no extant literature in Greece that can be placed earlier than about 900'or 800 B. C. with certainty. The Homeric poems and the works of Hesiod are the oldest surviving literary writings in Greek. Homer mentions the Sun, the Moon, the morning and evening star, the Pleiades, Hyades, Orion, Great Bear, Sirius (Orion's Dog), Bootes (Arcturus) and Hesiod mentions practi cally the same stars as Homer; Hesiod says that spring began Bixty days after winter solstice, puts down moon's period at thirty days, but does not mention equinoxes.738 It should be noted that Vedic astronomy several centuries (if not thousands of years) earlier than Homer and Hesiod was at least as advanced as that in the two Greek authors. The very ancient peoples (besides Indians and Chinese ) are the Egyptians, the Babylonians, the Hittites and Chaldeans. About the Egyptians, the Cambridge Ancient History (vol. II p. 218) states that there is very little trace of the application of Mathematics to Astro

nomy in Egypt and that, though the length of the solar year had been fairly accurately determined, this was done by observation of the heliacal rising of Sirius or Sothis which happened to correspond rather closely with the first rise of the Nile and involved no calculation whatsoever. About Hittites and Chaldeans there is not much to be said as no one asserts that naksatras were borrowed from them. Even about 800 B.C. Homer's and Hesiod's knowledge of astronomy was meagre. Even Hipparchus, regarded as the greatest astronomer of anti quity who completed his catalogue about 130 B. C., had access to a continuous series of observations made in Mesopotamia reaching back to 747 B. C.73a Ptolemy wrote about 150 A. D.; his Almagest is based on the observations of Hipparchus, and almost all that is known about the predecessors of Ptolemy is derived from the latter's work, as, owing to the very excellence of Ptolemy's work, all writings of his predecessors ceased to be studied and have not been recovered. The theory of Greek influ ence in astrology will be dealt with a little later on, but a fow words may be said here about the supposed influence of Greek astronomy on the Indian Siddhāntas739 and later works. In the

A continuous record of dated observations began with the reign of Nabanassar ( who began to rule in 747 B. C.), from which date the observations continued till Ptolemy's day; vide Heath's 'Greek Astronomy' p. XIV and pp. 142–143. Prof. Neugebauer has recently questioned the claims of Babylonian Kidinou to have discovered the precession of the equinoxes (in JAOS for 1950. vol. 70 pp. 1-8) and Morris Jastrow (Jr.) in "Hepatoscopy and Astrology' contributed to Proceedings of American Philosophical Society vol. XLVII at p. 671 appears to have done the same before him, Sarton ( in JAOS vol, 75 No. 3 p. 169 ) supports Prof. Neugebauer, though he admits that some of the Babyloniao observations made it easier for Hipparchus to discover precession of equinoxes.

XXXIII). 

Greek influence and Siddhāntas 

515 

first place no Indian work of the Siddhānta class admits that any Yavana knowledge was at the basis of the Indian astronomy nor do these ancient Sanskrit works on astronomy set out any large number of purely astronomical terms of Greek origin as Varāha does in astrology. The subjects to be dealt with in the Pañcasid dhāntikā are set out in chap. I. verses 5-and there is hardly any word therein that can be said to be originally Greek, Reliance is placed by Weber and others on the fact that two of the five Siddhāntas the characteristics of which are sum marised by Varāhamihira in his Karaṇa740 called Pañca siddhāntikā are designated Romaka and Paulisa and it is argued that this clearly suggests Greek influence. One should like to know the nuinber of purely Greek astronomical words employed in the Siddhāntas (older than Varāha) and different from the 36 or 37 Greek words said to have been employed in Sanskrit astrology by Varāha and others. Conceding for argument that Romaka stands for the Alexandrian school that does not prove Greek influence on the Siddhāntas. There is hardly any evidence to show that any medieval work or calendar in India followed or was based mainly upon the data of the Romaka,741 The length of its year is 365 days, 5 hours, 55 minutes and 12 seconds which exactly agrees with the deter mination of the extent of the year given by Hipparchus and accepted by Ptolemy (Thibaut in Grundriss p. 42). The rules set up by Varāha for ahargaņı according to Romaka give results for the meridian of Yavanapura (and not for that of Ujjayini). It did not occur to any Western scholar so far that the Romaka-siddhānta being in Sanskrit was most probably Composed by some Greek 742 settled in India familiar with 

740. Difference is made between a siddhānta work and a karana. The latter is a compendious astronomical work which does not discuss astrono mical theories at length (as the siddbāntas do ) and furoishes a set of concise and approximately correct rules for the quick performance of the more important astronomical computatioos. 

741. Not only was the Romaka not followed, but a comparatively early writer Brahmagupta (boro 598 A, D.) condemns it as beyond the pale of Biurtis: युगमन्वन्तरकल्पाः कालपरिच्छेदकाः स्मृतावुक्ताः। यस्मान रामके ते स्मृतिबाहो TAPAHIT I EE I. 13 quoted by S. B. Dikshit io I. A vol. 19 pp. 133-142, where Mr. Diksbit contends that the Romaka summarised in the Pañcasiddhaotikā is different from the Romaka of Srişeņa and that the former was composed before 150 A D.

This would suggest that in astronomy he did not tate them high or did not think they had anything special to impart to Indians or at least he did not base his astronomical theories on the works of Greek astronomers. He hardly ever employs any Greek words that are not already employed in his work on astrology. 

· Thibaut (Grundriss, p. 42 ) holds that the name Pulisa has decidedly a non-Indian appearance. One fails to understand why these learned writers are so positive about a certain name being non-Indian. We have in Sanskrit such ancient names as Pulastya, 744 Pulaha, Paulastya (for Kubera ) which contain most of the elements of the word Pulisa and are very similar to 

it. 'Even in these days Hindus bear such names as Nabobsingh. The siddhantas are called Paitāmaha and Paulisa because they were deemed to have been composed by Pitāmaha and Puliša. Alberuni, Thibaut says, traces the name Puliśa to a Greek author Paulus; but Alberuni who was familiar with both Indian and Greek authors might have committed a mistake, as even such a scholar as Weber, whose vast reading and pheno monal industry are a marvel, was misled by mere similarity in name and one recalls what was said in the drama Sakuntala by the attendant of Sakuntalā's little son that the child was misled by the similarity of names. Thibaut himself admits that it cannot be proved that the Paulisa siddhānta is related to the work of the Greek astrologer Paulus. Paulisa-siddhānta appears to have restricted itself mostly to astronomical matters. We have seen (p. 488) that the Paitamaha-siddhānta was composed about 80 A. D. Therefore, that Siddhānta could not have borrowed anything from Ptolemy ( 150 A. D.). Prof. Neugebauer again has 744a no doubt that the original impetus to scientific Hindu

astronomy came from Hellenistic astronomy, since he thinks that the use of the eccentric-epicyclic model alone is sufficient proof. But he is inclined to hold that the period of reception lies between Hipparchus and Ptolemy and hopes that a systematic study of Hindu astronomical works might reveal information about pre-Ptolemaic Greek astronomy no longer preserved in available Greek sources. It is doubtful whether that hope will ever be fulfilled. If ancient Indians were capable of analysing the elements of the Sanskrit language and raising such a system as Pāņini's, if they could plumb the depths of the human mind and create a mental discipline like the Yoga, if they carefully noted centuries before Christ the parts of the glottis and other organs in the mouth in the production of the letters of their language and produced the Prātišākhyas and Siksā works, if they could create a fable literature and invent the game of chess and make a gift of these two to the whole of mankind, if their knowledge of Algebra was of a superior order (vide Colebrooke's Essays, vol. II, at p. 446 and Cajori's 'a History of Elementary Mathematics' pp. 93-101), if they invented the decimal place value 7142 system for numbers and propagated it and the sign for a zero to Europe through the Arabs in the 12th century A. D., there is hardly any compelling reason for saying that it would not have been possible for them to arrive at their own eccentric and epicycle system (of which Prof. Neugebauer makes so much) independently of any other people to explain the

S. vol. 70 (1950) p. 7 admits that scholars are very far from a real insight into the development of Hellenistic astronomy before Ptolemy. In his review of the work on Indian studies by Professors Repou and Filliozat Prof. Neugebauer seems to bold that the discussion of Greek influence on Hindu astronomy and mathematics is of very little interest, since most of the Greek material was well known in Mesopotamia in the middle of the 2nd millenium

With them each position counted for 60 and not for ten. 123 in our decimal place value system is equal to 1 x 10' + 2 x 10' plus 3 A similar o in Mesopotamia would give 60% + 2 x 60' plus 3 = 3723. For numbers below 60 the notation was clumsy as a dividing line bad to be used for the teas and integers. 

Indian Astronomy and Greek influence

supposed motions of the Sun, the Moon and the planets round the earth. 

One more observation must be made here. The Vedānga Jyotişa 745 says 'The sun and the moon start towards the north in the month of Māgha at the beginning of Sravisthā (i. e. Dhanisthā) and the Sun starts towards the south in the middle of Āśleşā in the month of Srāvana' i. e. winter solstice was in the beginning of Dhanisthā. In the Bșhatsanhitā Varāhamihira tells us that in his day the two ayanas of the Sun took place at the beginning of Karkataka and of Makara respectively, that indeed at some time in the past Uttarāyana began at the beginning of Dhanişthā and dukşiņāyana commenced in the middle of Āślesā and that therefore it was so declared in former śāstras. This shows that, between about 505 A. D. when Varāha planned and probably wrote his Pañca-siddhāntikā and the observation contained in the Vedānga-Jyotisa, the commen. cement of Daksināyana had shifted from the middle of Aslesā to the last quarter of Punarvasu i. e. in all about 23 degrees and 20 minutes. Varāhamibira makes no effort to explain this. It is therefore quite reasonable to argue that he was probably not aware of the theory of the procession of the equinoxes. Autho rities are not in complete agreement as to the yearly extent of precession. Taking it at 50.2 seconds per year, the total number of years between Varāba and the date of the observation in Vedānga Jyotisa would be about 1673 and deducting 505 years (the time of Varāha's epoch for a siddhānta calculation) the observation would refer itself to about 1168 B. C. If Varāha and his prede cessors had borrowed scientific astronomy directly from the Greeks, they should have been quite aware of the precession of

equinoxes, since procession is said to have been discovered by Hipparchus, and was adopted by Ptolemy.7454 

This consideration bas special force in view of the fact that Varāha believed that the constellation of the Saptarsis ( Ursa Major) was in the Maghās at the time when Yudhisthira ruled, that that star group remains for one hundred years in each of the 27 naksatras and that therefore to complete one cycle through all naksatras the star group of Saptarsis required 2700 years.746 

There are other serious difficulties also in holding that the Sanskrit scientific astronomical treatises were acquainted with or borrowed from Ptolemy's work, Numerous discrepancies in essen tial matters exist between Ptolemy's work and Hindu astronomical works such as the assignment of different dimensions to the epicycles of the planets by Ptolemy and by Hindu writers. There fore, it is altogether improbable that the Hindu works were directly based on Ptolemy's work. Nor is there any direct evidence to show that Hindu works were based on Hipparchus or the works

In the first place, too much has to be taken for granted to make that thesis probable and in the 2nd place it would have to be admitted that precession, though kpown in the Vedic age, was forgotten before the times of Varā bamihira who is apparently not aware of it. ; Prof. K. V. Abhyankar (in Dhruva commemoration vol. III. pp. 155-164) tries to show that 'precession of the equinoxes' had been discovered in India in ancient times, but his arguments are far-fetched and not at all convincing.

of other Greek writers. No such Greek works are now available nor are even Greek elementary manuals of astronomers available which can be said to agree with Hindu scientific works. That an extensive Sanskrit literature on astronomy has perished is clear from Varāba-mihira's works and Utpala's quotations in his commentaries on the Bṛ. S. and Bṛhaj-jātaka. Modern Western writers would do well to observe at least for the present a non-committal attitude instead of repeating ad nauseum that Hindu scientific astronomy was derived from Greeks on slender similarities between the two systems and on obscure and ill understood passages and extracts in old astronomical works (vide E. Burgess in J. A. O. S. vol. VI at p. 480). 

After having briefly indicated the astronomical knowledge to be gathered from Vedic works, it is now necessary to show that astrological knowledge is also found in the Vedic texts from the oldest times. The human mind is very curious to know the future and is very prone to regard certain days, times and appearances as auspicious or favourable and others as inauspici ous. Various means were adopted by ancient peoples to pry into the future. The word astrology is now generally understood747 to mean the predictions about what would befall an individual based on the configurations of the Sun, the moon and the planets at the time of his birth. But this was not the sense or at least the only sense in which the word was used in very ancient times. Astrology known to us from the ancient Assyrians was concerned almost wholly with the interpretation of celestial phenomena and planetary configurations and the predictions about the immediate future in relation to the country, its people, its government or king, in such matters as the crops, floods, storms, invasions or other calamities. The events in the heavens, in the sky and even on the earth were supposed to intimate the thoughts of the gods, and to convey indications about impending happenings. This may be called natural astrology. Horoscopic astrology is a later development. Predictions were also derived by skilled diviners from various other happenings such as dreams, the flight and cries of birds, and the interpretation of the mysterious signs on the livers 748 of the sheep killed in sacrifices to gods in Babylon and Rome.

The first thing that we notice is that even in the Rgveda we have frequent references to 'auspiciousness of days' (sudinatve ahnām) in Rg. III. 8.5, III. 23.4, VII. 88.4, X. 70.1, (sudinatvam. ahnām' in Rg. II. 21. 6 and 'sudinesvahnām' in Rg. IV. 37.1). A few of these may be translated here. 'O Indra! establish amongst us abundance of wealth, freedom from injury to our bodies, sweetness of speech and luckiness of days' (Rg. II. 21.6); '(The sacrificial post) when planted on an auspicious day goes prospering in the sacrifice attended by many men'(Rg. III. 8.5 ); 

(Continued from last page) have been developed in India. Vide 'Hepatoscopy and Astrology in Babylonia and Assyria', a paper in the Proceedings of the American Philoso phical Society, vol. XLVII, pp. 646-676. Divination is either voluptary or involuntary. In the former marked arrows were used ( apparently referred to in Ezekiel 21. 21 ) or birds were sent out and the directions in which they flew were noted and interpreted or such things as dipping buds or flowers in water and placing them at the feet of the images of gods in India and noting whether the flowers on the right or left side fell down first. Involuntary divination depends on all kinds of sigas, phenomena and happenings that force themselves on one's attention such as aspects of the sun, the moon, planets, lightoing and clouds, dreams, chirping of birds and falling of lizards on one's body and the like. The Babylonian and Assyrian priests attached to temples made very extensive collections of omens and portents, but the interpretations almost exclusively concerned general welfare (viz. crops, pestilence, war, famine, plenty &c.) and if an individual was referred to it was only the king. The theory uoderlying hepatoscopy was that the animal offered was assimilated to the deity and the soul of the animal entered into the inner being of the god. The seat of life and of the soul was supposed to be the liver. The chief parts of the liver were the right and left lower lobes. Among the Romans the heart and lungs also were examined, the right representing the favourable side and left the unfavourable side. The priests did not besitate to apnounce to the king unfavourable results and applied their systems consistently. Astrology represented a comparatively more scientific view of the universe. The planets came to be regarded as gods even in the oldest astrological texts in which the five planets were identified with the chief gods of the Babylonian pantheon, viz. Jupiter with Marduk, Venus with Ishtar, Saturn with Ninib, Mercury with Nebo and Mars with Nergai, Jupiter (=Marduk p. 654) being always mentioned first. It was believed that through the planets and stars one can see gods at worko Prognostications varied according to the season or month of the year and the day. The Greek astrology offered a great contrast to the Babylonian, siace in the former the individual came to be all in all. The Greek astronomers obtained from the Babylonians the names for the constellations of the eclipitic, which are used even now in Europe. Vide Jastrow's 'Religion of Babylon and Assyria' p. 370 for identification of Marduk, Ishtar and other Babylonian gods with planets and p. 371 for the fact that Ishtar (Veous! figures most prominently among the preserved astrological texts and * Babylonian and Assyrian Religion' by S. H. Hooke pp. 24-30. 

Rgueda references to auspicious days 

523 

'O Agni! I establish thee on the best place of the earth (the uttaravedi), the place of worship and for libation, securing lucki ness of day; may you shine opulently on the (river) Drsadvati, on the concourse of people, on the river Apayā and on Sarasvati (Rg. III, 23.4).749, 

There are several other passages in which a wish is expressed that the days would be auspicious or lucky for sacrificers etc. Vide Rg. IV. 4. 7, V. 60.5, VII. 11, 2, VII, 18. 21, 1. 124.2 (May new dawns like the past ones shine for us with wealth and lucky days ), X. 39.12.749a 

It has already been seen above (note 726 ) that in Rgvedic times cows were driven (by way of dowry) to the bridegroom's house on Aghās (Maghās) and the bride was carried in a chariot to the bridegroom's house after the marriage on the Arjuni (or Phalguni) naksatra. In accordance with this the nakşatras on which marriage should be celebrated are enumerated in the Baud. gr. as Rohini, Mrgaśīrsa, Uttarā-Phalguni and Svāti. 

It has already been shown above (on p. 506) how Agnyādheya (the setting up of the sacred fires) was to be performed on one of seren naksatras or in spring, summer and autumn according to the varņā (class) of the performer (vide Kathaka S. 8.1, Sat. Br. II. 1.2, Tai. Br. I. 1.2.6-7). But an exception was recognized in the case of one performing a Soma sacrifice. It was provided that whenever a man had a desire to perform a Soma sacrifice he might establish the sacred fires in any season and that would bring prosperity to him.750. 

In ancient Vedic passages no clear line of demarcation appears between what may be called natural astrology and

749 a. The Greeks held the waxing moon lucky and the waping moon unlucky. Hesiodic system (which is at least several centuries later than the Rgveda) furnishes the earliest evidence for lucky and unlucky days, though Hesiod admits that there was divergence of opinion on that point. Hesiod puts a special ban on the 5th day of the montb, while the 7th day was sacred to Apollo in Greece and was held sacred in Babylon also. Vide L. R. arnell in 'Greece and Babylon' p. 294.

individual astrology. For example, in the Tai. Br.751 it is provided that people plough their fields on Anurādhā naksatra, of which Mitra is the presiding deity. The Pāraksaragshya prescribes in the same strain that a man should put the ploughshare (in his field) on an auspicious day or on Jyesthā nakşatra of which Indra is the presiding deity (and rains are in the hands of Indra). On the other hand, the same Brāhmaṇa 752 (Taittiriya) provides that if a man desires that his daughter should be dear to her husband be should get her married when the moon is in Nistyā (Svāti) naksatra and that if he does so his daughter becomes dear to her husband and never comes back to her father's house. The naksatras from Krttikā to Viśākhā have been declared to be Devanaksatras and whatever rites are performed on them are declared to have been performed on a holy day (punyāna). Even as early as the Atharvaveda 753 it appears to have been believed that a boy born on Jyesthā or on Vicrt (i. e. Mūla naksatra) or on a day called tiger-like (on an evil or terrible naksatra) might himself die or bring about the death of his father or mother. The two verses may be translated as follows: '(the boy) is born on Jyesthaghni (i. e. Jyesthā) or on Vicrt which belongs to Yama; guard him against being uprooted; may (Agni) take him beyond all evil results in order that he may reach the long life of a hundred autumns. This valiant son was born on a tiger-like day and naksatra; may be not, while he grows, kill his father or his mother that gave him birth.' 

Thus it appears that some naksatras were called punya (auspicious or holy) as in Tai. Br. I. 5.2.1 or III. 1, 2.8, while

Nakşatras auspicious or evil 

525 

some others (like Jyesthā, Māla) were held to be pāpa (evil) naksatras. 

From a passage in the 754 Bř, Up. it appears that certain naksatras were called male "if a man desires May I reach greatness' he should observe milk diet for twelve days beginning in the northward passage of the Sun, in the bright half of a month and on a favourable day he offers into the fire on a male naksatra &c." 

From the above examples it will be apparent that prognos tications were based in very early Vedic times on the naksatras either of birth or on naksatras deemed auspicious or inauspicious. Puşya appears to have been regarded as a very auspicious naksatra long before Pāṇini, who mentions another name of it as 'Sidhya'. But in these early times it does not appear that any rules had been arrived at about the influence of planets (except perhaps of Jupiter in Pusya) in certain naksatras or about horoscopes with planets in nakşatras or rāśis (signs of the zodiac) or in certain 'houses'. In those days prognostica tions were confined mainly to naksatras, days and natural phenomena and bodily marks. For example, Pāṇini I. 4. 39 (Tutelupa lam:') provides a rule for a diviner considering the good or bad luck of a person. The FIFT explains 'laay: 999: विप्रश्नः। स कस्य भवति यस्य शुभाशुभं पृच्छयत। देवदत्ताय राध्यति ईक्षते वा नैमित्तिकः ZE: 7 CHIFT a quiciazai'. In qirola IV. 3, 73 'Spuigailet:' it is provided that the affix 370 (and not 34) is applied in the sense of 'तत्र भवः' or 'तस्य व्याख्यानः ' to the words in the ऋगयनगण, which contains among others the words अऋविद्या, उत्पात and निमित्त (i. e. alhlfa and stienila would mean 'one who expounds the future consequences indicated by 3917 i. e. earthquake &c. and afha throbbing &c.). Under qua III, 2.53 the fer gives the examples initia164:, giat quran (line on the palm ). 

We find from certain verses of the Rgveda that the cries of such birds as kapiñjala were deemed even in those ancient times

to indicate coming events, auspicious or otherwise; 755 '(the bird) crying again and again and voicing (indicating) coming event sends forth his speech as an oarsman propels a boat; O bird! may you be auspicious to us and may no unfavourable sign reach you from any quarter; O birdl may you that are auspicious and whose cry forebodes good cry to the south of (our) houses; may no thief master us nor may any one declare that we may meet danger.' Br. S, 98. 14 provides that birds indicate to a person going on a journey the evil results of actions, good or evil, done by him in former lives. The Yoga-yātrā of Varāhamihira (chap. 14) and Adbhutasāgara pp. 569-582 deal at length with sakuna (prognostications from the sight, flight or cries of birds and other animals). Yogayātrā (14.2 and 26 ) provides that certain birds and animals when they are to the right or southern side of a man starting on a journey indicate auspicious results and that when a cāsa bird with something in its mouth flies to the right side of a man that is an indication of welfare. 

The result of the dependence on ideas of lucky and unlucky days and naksatras was that some people began to make observations and deduce conclusions and a lore called 'naksatra -vidyā' arose. When Nārada approached the great teacher Sanatkumāra for knowledge, the latter questioned him as to what he already knew and then Nārada enumerated a long list of lores (including 756 the four Vedas, Itihāsa-purāņa), one of which is 'naksatravidyā' ('the science of nakşatras' i. 6. astronomy and astrology ). It can be easily imagined how credulous people in ancient times as even in these days con sulted those who professed to know what the stars foretold and were often deceived or felt frustrated. Hence arose even in early times a prejudice against star-gazers, astrologers and the

like. One of the earliest references to this projudice against star gazers in Sanskrit literature is found in the Tai. Bṛ. III, 4. 4 and Vāj. S. 30. 10 and 20, where the 757 'naksatradarśa' (star-gazer) is made over as a victim to prajñana and tha 'ganaka'( calculator of the movements of stars and planets) is consigned to aquatic animals along with the headman of the village. Among the long list of brāhmapas that should not be invited for religious rites in honour of gods or in śrūddhas, Manu (III, 162 ) includes one who maintains himself by the practice of astrology (naksatrair. yaśca jīvati) and in (VI. 50 ) Manu prohibits ascetics from desiring to secure alms by foretelling the results of portents (like earth-quakes) or of bodily 758 movements (such as the throbbing of the eye or arm ) or by nakşatravidyā ( astrology ) or angaridyā (palmistry) or by casuistry or by telling what the śāstra ordains on a (disputed) point. The ancient sūtras of Hārīta and of Sankhalikhita declare that a nakşat rajivin (one who lives by practising astrology) and a 'naksatrādesavrtti' (who makes his livelihood by conveying the message of nakşa tras ) respectively are unfit to sit in a row with other brāhmaṇas (q. by Krtyakalpataru on śrāddha p. 88). Similarly, Sumantu (in a prose passage q. on śrāddha by Krtyakalpataru p. 91 ) states the same about a 'mūlyasāmvatsarika' (who practises astrology for money ). The Vişnudharma-sūtra (chap. 82.7) includes those who maintain themselves by astrology (naksatra jivinah ) among those who are not to be invited for srāddha rites. Similarly, the Tevijjasutta ( S. B. E. vol. XI. pp. 196–197) and Mahāśila in Digbanikāya (I. p. 68 ) condemn for Buddhist monks maintenance by such low arts as guessing at the length of a man's life or by foretelling future events (such as eclipses, falling meteors, victory and defeat &c.). But the mere study of constellations is allowed by Buddha (in S. B. E. vol. XX. pp. 292-294). Among obstacles to gain 759 Kautilya enumerates

many such matters as passion of love, anger, timidity and desire to find out an auspicious tithi and naksatra' and winds up with two fine verses characteristic of the great genius that placed Candragupta Maurya on the throne of Magadha: "The desired object ( or wealth) eludes that childish man that is excessively in search of what the stars portend: for the desired object is ( itself) the star that governs ( success ) in securing it; what will stars do? Men striving ( to attain their ends ) will secure their objects after hundreds of efforts; wealth is caught by wealth just as elephants are bound by other elephants (opposed to them ).' From the above it is quite clear that several centuries before Christ an astrologer ( who maintained himself on money acquired by the practice of astrology) was very much condemned. 

What Kautilya regards as reprehensible is extreme reliance on and pursuit of naksatra astrology, but it is not to be supposed that he ignored prognostications altogether. About the king's purohita (priest ) he lays down the following 760 *the king should appoint as priest a person whose family and character are highly spoken of, who has well studied the Veda together with the six angas, the divine and other portents and the science of the government of people and who can prevent divine and human calamities by means contained in the Atharvaveda, the king should follow him as a pupil does his teacher or a son his father or a servant his master. Yāj. (I. 313), who is later than Kautilya by some centuries, also lays down in almost identical words that the king should appoint as purohita one who is proficient in astrology, endowed with all requirements declared in śāstras, and is proficient in the science of govern ment and the propitiatory and magic rites of the Atharvaveda'. 

Another set of texts indicates another stage in the develop ment of astrology based on naksatras, which seems to have been 

somewhat on the lines of the later horoscopic system of ‘houses". Traces of it exist though they are not very ancient. The Vaikhānasasmārta 761 sūtra (IV. 14) refers to nakşatras called Janma, Karma, Sānghātika, Sāmudayika and Vaināśika and these terms are explained in the Yogayātrā of Varāha and in the

Visnudharmottara-purana.762 The Yogayatra remarks763 - the naksatra on which a man is born is called ādya (first), the tenth from it (from ādyu ) is called kirma, the 16th naksatra from the adya is called 'sānghātika' (pertaining to a group or a collection of human beings), the 18th (from adya) is called Samudaya (collection) and the 23rd (from ādya) is called Vaināśika (lit. pertaining to death or destruction), the 25th (from adya) is called mūnasa (pertaining to the mind); in this way all persons are concerned with six naksatras (1st, 10th, 16th, 18th, 23rd and 25th ); they say that the king is concerned with nine nakşatras, the three additional ones being those connected with his jāti (caste), his country and with the naksatra on the day of his coronation. The Yogayātrā and Vişnudharmottara (I. 78. 14-16) further provide 'when the naksatra of one's birth is affected by evil (star or aspect) the results are the appearance of disease, loss of money, and disputes%3B if the nakşatra called karma is affected then one's under takings do not succeed; if the Sānghātika (16th) is affected then there is treachery; when the Sāmudayika (18th) is affected there is loss of accumulated wealth; when the Vainasika (23rd) is affected, one's desired objects perish; when Manasa (25th) is affected, there is anxiety and unhappiness. The Nārada purāņa,7634 after defining the above, remarks that one should not commence any auspicious act on these. When the (six ) naksatras are not affected (by evil stars or aspects) a person is healthy, enjoys happiness, his body is well-nourished and he is endowed with wealth; but if the six naksatras are affected he

perishes and the king also (meets the same fate) if the six along with the extra three are affected. When 764 the naksatra on which a king was crowned is affected by evil planets or aspects, one should predict loss of the kingdom, if the naksatra of the country is affected trouble to the country and capital is indicated and if the naksatra of the king's caste is affected then one should predict king's illness. The naksatras according to the caste of the king are as follows 765 : the three Pūrvas (Phalguni, Purvāsādha and Purvābhādrapadā) and Krttikā are paksatras of the king of the brāhmaṇa class; the three Uttarās (Uttarā Phalguni, Uttarāsādha and Uttarābhādrapada) and Puşya are naksatras for a king of the ksatriya caste; Revati, Anuradhā, Magha and Rohini, of agricultural class; Punarvasu, Hasta, Abhijit and Ašvini are naksatras of the vanik (trader) class. The countries governed by the nakşatras are set out in chap. 14 of the Brhat-samhitā. Herein Varāha differs from Ptolemy in two respects:(1) Varāba does not mention countries governed by rāśis, but countries governed by naksatras; (2) Varāha confines himself to India, while Ptolemy in his Tetrabiblos ( 11. 3 pp. 157-159, Loeb Classical Library) deals with all countries then known. This is an important circumstance against the theory that Varāba's astrology is borrowed from Ptolemy or later Greek writers. If he had known Ptolemy's work he could have easily followed bim even as to countries outside India. The whole of India is divided into nine parts, the Madhyadeśa and the regions in the eight quarters from the East to the North-east, each part being under groups of three naksatras from Krttikā on wards. Vide also Vişnudharmottara I. 86. 1-9. When the group of three naksatras in each of nine divisions is affected by the Sun, Mars or Saturn, the countries falling under any of the three naksatras of the group suffer calamities. The Mārkapdeya purana (chap. 58. 10-54 in B. I. edition, chap. 55 in Venkateśvara Press edition) also specifies the countries in the nine groups, but the names differ to some extent. There is some divergence

765. The Echia (15, 28-30= RATET IX. 5-7) specifies the naksatras of brābmana, ksatriya, agriculturists, traders &c. Two may be quoted here; पूर्वाश्रयं सानलमग्रजानां राज्ञां तु पुष्येण सहोत्तराणि। सपौष्णमैत्रं पितृदेवतं च प्रजापतेभ च कृषीवलानाम्॥ आदित्यहस्ताभिजिदाश्विनानि वणिग्जनानां प्रवदन्ति भानि। मूलत्रिनेत्रानिल.

about the nomenclature also. According to Parāśara and the Vişnudharmottara (1. 87, 7) the 4th naksatra from the naksatra of birth is called Mānasa. A nakşatra 766 is said to be affected (upahata ) when the Sun or Saturn occupies it or when Mars is retrograde in it or occults it or an eclipse ( of the Sun or Moon) occurs in it or a meteor strikes it or when the moon continuously affects it (by occulting or occupying its middle or goes to the southern part of it). The Visņudharmottara (I. 89. 1-13), Yogayātrā IX. 13-18, and Parāśara (quoted by the Adbhuta sāgara pp. 271–274) prescribe certain śānti rites for averting the evil effects of the above noted nine nakşatras being affected. 767 

It should be noted that in the astrology depending on twelve rāśis and twelve bhāras ( places or houses ) karma is the name given to the 10th house from the first (just as in the case of naksatra astrology ) and mrtyu ( i. e. vināśa) is the name of the 8th bhāra. 

The Mahābhārata and the Rāmāyaṇa contain numerous passages where the planets in relation to certain nakşatras are stated to indicate misfortunes to people in general, to warring armies and to individuals. A few examples may be cited by way of illustration. When in the sanguinary battle between Rāvana and Rāma, the former seemed to be getting the better of Rāma, the Rāmāyaṇa states 768 Mercury stood covering the Rohini nakşatra which is presided over by Prajāpati and which is the favourite of the moon and thereby indicated evil fortune to people'. Similarly, it is said 'Mars stood covering the nakşatra Visakhā in the sky, which is presided over by Indra and Agni and which is the naksatra of the Kosalas'. In the Mahābhārata numerous statements are made about the position of the planets, the naksatras and tithis, which it is almost

767. In the Malavikāgoimitra of Kalidasa the Vidūsaka says to the king in the 4th Act 'astrologers declare that your nakşatra is afflicted and (therefore) you should release all persoas confined in jails '.

impossible to reconcile. Vide H. of Dh. vol. III, pp. 903-923 for consideration of the astronomical data in the Mahābhārata. Here we are concerned only with the beliefs about certain omens and portents. In the Bhisma-parva we read 769 a white celestial body stands traversing Citrā nakşatra; one sees therein specially the destruction of the Kurus; a very frightful comot stands covering Pusya-naksatra; this great graha will bring about terrible evil to both armies. A white blazing graha resembling fire emitting smoke stands covering the bright Jyesthā-naksatra whose presiding deity is Indra; a cruel comet standing between Citrā and Svāti afflicts Rohiņi and the Sun and the Moon'. 

There are several statements about Mars that are more or less irreconcilable.770 For example, the Udyogaparva says 'Mars having been retrograde in Jyesthā seeks (to reach or afflict?) Anurādhā presided over by Mitra, as if bringing death'; while Bhişma-parva remarks ‘Mars is retrogade in Maghā and Jupiter is in Sravana and Saturn afflicts the naksatra presided over by Bhaga (i. e. Purvā Phalguni). About Saturn several 771 statements are made a refulgent and malignant planet, Saturn, afflicts the naksatra (ruled over by Prajāpati i. e. Rohiņi) and will afflict people more'; 'Saturn stands afflicting Rohini'; Jupiter and Saturn are near Viśākhā'. 

One very remarkable feature of the Mahābhārata passages is that while they put forward dozens of times the positions of the Sun, the Moon and planets in reference to naksatras, not a single passage gives the position of the planets in relation to rāśis, the signs of the Zodiac, or week-days (such as Tuesday, Sunday &c.). 

The Atharvaņa Jyotisa furnishes a somewhat different scheme of nakşatra astrology. It says:772 the 10th naksatra from

the naksatra of a man's birth is called karma, the 19th (from janma-naksatra) is called garbhādhānaka (naksatra of concep tion), the 2nd, 11th and 20th constitute the group called sampatkara ( bringing about prosperity), the 3rd, 12th and 21st (from janmanaksatra) constitute the group of vipatkara (bringing about ill-luck or distress), the 4th, 13th and 22nd are called kşemya (causing prosperity), the 5th, 14th and 23rd are called ' pratvara (pratyari?)', 6th, 15th and 24th constitute (the group called) sādhaka ( that accomplish), the 7th, 16th and 25th are called naidh ina (relating to death), the 8th, 17th and 26th are maitra (friendly ), the 9th, 18th and 27th constitute a highly friendly group. These are nine groups (each made up of three naksatras from among 27 naksatras and each one in each group being separated by the number 9 from the next in the same group). These names make a further approach to the scheme of twelve bhāvas 713 viz. janma (which corresponds in name and import to tanu or lagna), sampat (corresponds to the 2nd bhāva called dhana), karna(is same as 10th bhāva), naidhana (corresponds to 8th bhāva called vināśa or mṛtyu), maitra (corresponds to the 4th bhāva called suhrt), kşemya (corresponds to the name of the 11th bhāva called aya or lābha). The Atharvana-Jyotisa then provides at some length what should be done or not done on these nine groups and their constituents. The above mentioned words (vipatkara, kşemya &c.) occur also in Brhad-yogayātrā

It should be noted that the Atharvaņa-Jyotisa gives at least five names that are the same as the corresponding bhāvas in extant Jataka works. It is difficult to state the date when the extant Atharvana Jyotisa might have been composed. It mentions week-days but does not enumerate the twelve zodiacal signs, it refers to the doctrine of Bhrgu (9.1.). Verses 1-4 of Ātharvana Jyotisa (chapter 13 ) are the same as Manu III. 46-49; similarly, Atharvana Jyotisa 12. 8-9 are almost the same as Manu IV. 41-42. It is quite possible that the present text is a recast of an older work. In any case the present text of the Atharvana Jyotisa cannot be placed earlier than the 2nd or 1st century B.C, and may be a little later still But it appears that the present Atharvaņa Jyotisa only collects together the ideas then current and therefore the five names (janma, sampat, naidhana, mitra and karma) could very well have been current centuries before the present Atharvaņa Jyotişa text. Similarly, it is difficult to assign an exact date to the Vişnu-dharmottara purapa. It is in the nature of an encyclopaedia of the then knowledge of several lores and its present text may be assigned to some period between the 4th and sixth century A. D. 

From the passage of the Brhadāraṇyka Upanisad (in note 754) it would be seen how auspicious times were prescribed for rites to be performed by an individual. The Brāhmaṇas and Kalpasūtras prescribed the auspicious naksatras and seasons for solemn Vedic sacrifices. The grhya and dharma sūtras pre scribed for domestic rites auspicious times, which were either the same or similar to those prescribed in the Brāhmaṇas, Br. Up. and the Kalpasūtras. A few examples may be cited here. The Āśvalāyana (I. 13.1), Āpastamba (VI. 14.9), Baudhāyana (I. 10. 1) and Pāraskara (I. 14) and other gļhyasūtras provide that the rite of Pursavana (that would produce male issue) was to be performed in the third month after conception on Tisya (Pusya) nakşatra or on a day on which the moon would be in

a male naksatra.774 The Bhāradvājagļhya expressly mentions Tisya, Hasta, Anurādhā, Uttarā Bhādrapadā as the proper naksatras for pumsavana. As regards caula (tonsure ) Apastamba-grhya (VI. 16.3) prescribes that it should be per formed in the third year after birth on Punarvasu nakşatra. The name of the nakşatra may be noted, which literally means 'fresh wealth or new growth.' The Kausika-gūtra mentions' pāpanaksatra' (in 46.25) and pumnaksatra (lucky naksatra) in 35. 2. There are varying provisions about marriage. The Āp. gr. says that all seasons are proper for marriage, excepting the two months of Sisira (viz, Māgha and Phālguna) and excepting the last month (Āsādha) of summer, and all naksatras declared to be auspicious.775 The sutra also quotes an ancient gāthā stating that persons for choosing a girl should be sent out on Invakās (i e. Mrgaśīrsa) and then they are greeted with success. As regards marriage the Gobhila-gļhya provides a simple rule that it should be performed on an auspicious ( punya ) naksatra, while the Pāraskara 716 is more elaborate viz. one should take a maiden's hand in marriage in the northward passage of the sun, in the fortnight of the increasing moon, on an auspicious day and on Uttarā Phalguni, Hasta, Citrā, Uttarāsādhā, Sravana, Dhanisthā, Uttara-bhadrapadā, Revati, AŚvini, Svāti, Mrgasiras and Rohiņi nakşatras. The Baudhāyana-gļhya 777 declares: all months are proper for marriage; some (sages ) say that the months of Asadha, Māgha and Phālguna are to be avoided; the naksatras for marriage are Rohini, Mțgaśirsa, UttarāPhalguni and Svāti; while for other auspicious rites the naksatras are

Punarvasu, Tisya, Hasta, Sroņā (Sravana) and Revati. The Āśvalāyana-grhya generalises the auspicious times for several important saṁskāras as follows:778 'the rites for caula, u panayana, godāna and marriage are to be performed in the northward passage of the sun, in the fortnight of the waxing moon and on an auspicious naksatra; some (sages) hold that marriage may be performed at all times'. Āśv. further provides that the maiden after marriage was to observe silence and to begin speaking after seeing the Polestar, Arundhati and the constella tion of the Seven Sages. This generalisation is carried further by the Pūryamımāmsā-sūtra which provides 779 all ritas in honour of the gods are to be performed in the northward passage of the sun, on a day in the bright half of the month and on an auspicious day'. 

It will be seen clearly from the above discussion that an auspicious naksatra was the sine qua non in almost all Vedio rites and also in ordinary domestic rites in the times of the Brāhmaṇas and sūtras (several centuries before the Christian era), the tithi was rarely mentioned, the week-day was not mentioned nor the name of any rāśi ( zodiacal sign) nor is there any reference to the planets Jupiter and Venus in most sūtras even when prescribing proper times for upanayana or marriage. 

This requirement of finding out an auspicious day or nakşatra for the celebration of a marriage or other domestic rite or for engaging in any undertaking was said in medieval Sanskrit works to be a search for an auspicious muhurta. It is therefore necessary to hold a discussion on the meaning and history of the word muhurta.

Muhurta 

The word 'muhūrta' occurs twice in the Rg. In the dialogue between the rivers and sage Viśvamitra that had come to the confluence of the Sutudri (modern Sutlaj) and the Vipās (modern Beas) occurs the following 780 .for the sake of my words (of your praise) that will be followed by the offering of soma may you, that follow the established order (of nature ), stop from 781 flowing for a short while'. In another place the Rgveda says *the opulent Indra, employing many tricks, often assumes different forms from off his own body, since he, being invoked by mantras addressed to him and upholder of the cosmic order and drinking soma at (usual and even) unusual times, comes thrice from heaven for a short time.' In both these passages 'muhūrta' means a short time, a few moments'. This meaning of muhurta is found in the Sat. Br. I. 8. 3. 17 (tan muhurtain dhārayitvā) and JI. 3. 2. 5 (atha prātaḥ anaśitvā muhūrtam sabhāyām-āsitvāpi) and in classical Sanskrit works like the Raghuvamsa ( V. 58). 

There is another meaning of the word 'muhūrta' in sat. Br. X. 4. 2. 18 and XII. 3. 2.5 where it is said that there are fifteen muhūrtas of the day and fifteen of tbe night (i. e. 30 in ahorālra) and that in a year there are 10800 muhūrtas (30 X 360 782).

(Sec. II, Ch. XVI 

Here the word muhurta means 15th part of the day ( i.e. in a general way about two nādikas or ghatikās). Rg. x. 189.3 appears 783 to contain a somewhat recondite allusion to thirty parts of the day and night 'by the rays of the sun thirty loca tions of the day (and night) shine forth; a laud is offered to the bird (the sun).' The fifteen names (viz. citra, ketu &c.) of the muhūrtas of the day and 15 muhurtas of the night occur in Tai. Br. II1.784 10. 1. 1-3. The Vedanga-Jyotisa states that two nadikās are equal to a muhurta (verse 7 of Vedanga-Jyotisa of Rg.) and that there is a difference of six muhūrtas ( i. e. 12 ghatıkūs) between the longest and shortest day. 785 Manu I. 64, Kautilya ( quoted in note 681) and several purāpas ( quoted in note 682) state that day and night are together equal to thirty muhurtas Therefore, the second meaning of muhūrta from early Brāhmaṇa times at least was 'a period of two gbaţikās'. The Kausitaki-upanişad speaks of muhurtas called Yeştihas. 786 

It appears that some centuries before the Christian era the 15 mubūrtas of the day had received names different from those in the Tai. Br. The Baudhāyana-dharma-sātra (II. 10. 26), 

Manu IV. 92 and Yaj. I. 115 prescribe 787 that a householder should get up from his bed in the Brāhma-muhūrta ( the last half watch of the night). The Brāhmamuhūrta is mentioned in

Dronaparva (80.23). In the Raghuvamsa (V. 36) Kalidasa says that Aja was born on the Brāhma muhūrta ( i. . Abhijit of which Brahmā is the presiding deity) and in the Kumāra. sambhava (VII. 6 ) he says that the female relatives of Pārvati decked her in readiness for her marriage on Maitra muhūrta and when the Moon was in Uttarā-Phalguni-nakşatra. tithi (5th). Besides, in several places auspicious tithis, naksatras and muhurtas are mentioned in general (e. g. Sabhā 2. 15 and 23. 4, Vana 253. 28). The Atharvaņa Jyotisa (1. 6-11 ) names the 15 muhurtas of the day as noted below. 783 The Mubūrtadarśana (or Vidya-madhaviya) gives almost the same 15 names ( except Gāndharva for Viśyāvasu), inserts Sakra before Vāruña and omits Saumya and states that seven of these are auspicious viz. 789 Abhijit, Vairāja, Sveta, Sāvitra, Maitra, Bala and Vijaya. The Adiparva (123.6) states that Yudhisthira was born when the moon was in the naksatra presided over by Indra (i. e. Jyesthā), on the 8th muhūrta called Abhijit, when the sun was on the meridian by day and on a tithi called pārņā (here the 5th ). In the Udyogaparva it is stated that a purohita was sent as a dūta of the Pandavas on Puşya yoga 790 and Jaya muhūrta (here Jaya is probably the same as Vijaya). The Manusmrti says that naming the child should be done on the 10th or 12th day (from birth ) on an auspicious tithi, muhūrta and naksatra. 791 It would be proper to assume that the auspicious muhurtas intended by Manu are the same as the seven mentioned in the Vidyāmādhaviya.

Vāyupurāņa enumerates the names of the 15 muhurtas in the day somewhat differently and also of the night. 792 The Matsya. purāna (in chap. 22. 2) refers to two muhurtas, Abhijit and Rauhiņa and mentions eight muhūrtas as auspicious on which to begin the construction of a new house. 793 It also speaks of Kutapa as the 8th mubūrta ( 22. 84 ) and states that Kutapa and the following four muhũrtas are the home of svadhā (i. e. śrāddha must be begun on kutapa and completed before the 12th muhūrta ends). It would be seen from the above that the names of muhūrtas were given at least twice, first in the Tai. Br. and then in the Atharvaņa Jyotişa and the Purāṇas. A further stage was probably reached when their names receded into the background and practically disappeared from such works as those of Varāhamihira and only the names of the deities presid ing over the 30 muhūrtas of day and night remained and the muhūrtas came to be known by the names of the deities. Though Varāhamihira refers to the muhūrtas of day and night in Brhat-samhitā 42. 12 and 98.3, he does not set out their names in that work, but in his Bṛhad-Yogayātrā he sets out the 30 names of the deities presiding over the muhūrtas of day and night as quoted in the note below.794 Varāha remarks: what

What should be done on muhurtas of day 

541 

ever has been stated as proper for being done on certain nakşam tras, may be done on tithis presided over by the deities of those nakşatras and also on kiraņas and on mukūrtas; that leads to success as the deity is the same.795 For example, if a certain thing is recommended for being done on Ardra nakşatra, then it may be done also on the muhūrta of Siva (i. e. the first muhūrta of the day) as the nerału of both (the naksatra Ardra and the first muhurta) is the same (viz. Rudra). The Atharvana Jyotisa ( 2. 1-11 ) and (3. 1-6 ) dilates upon what should be done on the 15 muhurtas of the day. Some examples may be cited here: on Raudra may be done whatever is of a terrific nature; on Maitra should be done whatever is affectionate or friendly; on Sārabhata black magic may be resorted to against enemies; Abhijit is proper for all desired objects and gives success in all undertakings; Vijaya leads to victory if one marches on it, one may perform auspicious acts on it and sūrili rites; on Bhaga muhūrta one should choose a brāhmaṇa maiden for marriage and such a one married on Bhaga does not turn out unchaste. It may be noticed that Patañjali (on Vārtika one on Pāṇini V.1. 80 ) refers to the fact of a person being engaged for a month to teach one muhūrta every day.7% 

After the vernal equinox, days become gradually longer than the night and after the autumnal equinox nights are gradually longer and longer than the day. As there are only thirty muhūrtas from one sunrise to the next sunrise it is proper to say that a muhurta is equal to two ghatikās (i. e. 48 minutes). But it is also said that there are 15 muhurtas of the day. The longest day in India of the Vedānga-jyotişa locality was of 36 ghatikās and therefore if one insisted on the number 15 each muhūrta on that day would be 2 is gbaţikās, while as the shortest day was 24 ghatikās in length each muhūrta of that day would be only 1; ghatikās. This difference in length in the case of muhurtas is noted by the Vişnudharmottara (I. 73. 6-8) and by the Brahmāndapurāna (I. 2. 21. 122–123). The Vişnudharmottara (I. 83. 67-73) sets out the names of the deities of the 30 muhūrtas. It appears that in ancient times it was understood that the long est day gained and was of 18 muhūrtas, while the short night of

(Sec. II, Ch. XVI 

that day had only 12 muhūrtas i. e. 6 muhurtas got attached to the day sometimes and 6 muhūtas got attached to the night sometimes when it was longest. Patañjali 797 in his bhāsya on Vārtika 2 of Pāṇini II. 1. 29 mentions this. This would be a matter of personal observation which need not extend beyond a few years. But even here Prof. Neugebauer smells Mesopotamian influence (Exact sciences in Antiquity' p. 178). This is a characteristic example of the jaundiced eyes with which most Western writers look at things Indian. If the writer of the Vedanga Jyotisa was a native of the extreme north west of India or had stayed there for some years he would have easily noticed the difference between the longest day and the short est day as about twelve ghaţikās, particularly as that very verse of the Vedānga-jyotisa shows that water clocks were then used. Even illiterate people in the villages of Bombay State know that the difference between the longest and shortest day in their villages is about six ghatikās (as Bombay is a little over 18 degrees, N. Lat.). There is nothing to show that the writer of the Vedānga-Jyotisa was not a person who was either born in the extreme north-west of India or stayed there. The North-West of India was a centre of Sanskrit culture at least six centuries preceding the Christian era and Taksasilā (Taxila ) was a great University where princes came to learn (vide Rhys Davids in "Buddhist India' p. 8). Panini hailed from that part, it appears, and teaches the formation of words like Saindhava, Tākşašila and Sālāturiya as meaning a person whose ancestors lived in or who himself stayed in Sindhu or in Taksasilā or in Salātura ( Pan. IV.3. 89-90 and 93–94). Later writers call Pāṇini Sālāturiya (vide Bhāmaba VI 62-63). To suppose that a learned Indian who was writing a work on Jyotisa had to run all the way from India to Mesopotamia a thousand or more miles for finding out the difference between the longest and shortest day in his own country or for saying that the difference between the longest and shortest day in Mesopotamia being 12 ghatikās the same was the difference between them in India or for consulting works written in the Cuneiform characters for that purpose almost borders on the absurd. Besides Prof Neugebauer is not quite correct. The latitude of Babylon is 32'. 40' North and even there the ratio would not be exactly as 3 to 2. Gāndhāra is 31°. 40'

North Lat; one who is to the north of Gāndhāra may quite naturally say that the ratio is about 3 to 2. Vide C. R. C. Report p. 225. Further in Journal of Near Eastern Studies, vol. 8 (pp. 6-26), Prof. Waerden points out (at p. 18) that even in Babylonia the great omen series started from the primitive ratio 2:1 and that it was only later that the more accurate value 3:2 became known, 

It has been shown so far that the word 'muhurta' had two meanings in the ancient Vedic times, viz. for a short time' and 'a part equal to two ghatikās.' As some muhūrtas of the day (of the duration of two ghatikās) were declared to be auspicious, gradually a third meaning came to be attached to this word viz. time that is fit for the performance of an auspicious act°798 It would be shown later on how the medieval Dharmaśāstra works are full of muhūrtas in this sense. 

In order to thoroughly understand the requirements about muhūrta in this third sense some knowledge of the planets, the twelve bhāras ( houses or places in a horoscope ) and the rāśis would be necessary. Before entering on a discus sion of these latter matters reference must be made to the change that came over even the best minds of India from about the 4th century B.C. It has been seen above (p.527) how the star-gazer and the yaņaka had come to be condemned and how one who was a professional astrologer (for money ) had been looked down upon as an unworthy brāhmaṇa. All the same there was even about 500 or 600 B. C. a small section of people who looked upon the astrologer as all important, particularly to the king. The Gautamadharmasūtra 799 provides the king should choose as his purohita (palace priest) a brāhmaṇa endowed with learning, good family, eloquence, handsomeness, (middle ) age ( neither too young nor too old ), character, and who is righteous in conduct and austere; the king should perform all (religious ) acts as directed by the priest; he should respect (i.e. follow and not discard) what those who have devoted

thought to astrology and the lore of omens and portents apno unce ( as required to be done ), because some ūčūryas (teachers ) assert that the welfare ( of the country or king ) depends upon that (upon doing what astrologers and experts in portents declare ).' This trend of thought gradually gathered greater and greater strength till at last even the great smrtikāra 

Yājñavalkya categorically 800 declared in the first centuries of the Christian era “one should sedulously worship that planet that is badly affected (in a person's horoscope ). Brahmā conferred a boon on then (planets) ' when worshipped you should honour the worshipper' (with favours ). The rise and fall of kings is depen dent on the planets, as also the emergence and the disappearance of the world; therefore planets are to be worshipped most". Yājñavalkya no doubt declares 891 that 'success in undertakings is dependent upon daira (luck) and human effort; out of these, daiva is really human effort of previous lives made manifest ( in this life ). Just as a chariot cannot be set in motion on one wheel, so luck does not succeed unless there is human effort ( also )'. Discussion of the relative importance of daiva (luck or destiny) and human effort are frequent in Dharmaśāstra works, particularly in the Mahābhārata, there being three

tendencies viz. (firstly ) daiva is all powerful, ( secondly ) human effort is superior, (thirdly ) a golden mean between the two. Vide H. of Dh. vol. III. pp. 168–169 for discussion and for passages supporting all the three views. The first chapter of Brhad yogayātrā ( 20 verses ) and also of the Yogayātrā ( 22 verses ) deal with daiva (Luck, Fate) and puruşakāra. In spite of this, from the king to the lowliest man, almost everyone was firmly in the grip of astrology and even now astrology has great influence over some highly educated Indians. Astrology based on horoscopes and dealing with individuals was called horāśāstra or jātaka. By the time of Varāhamihira even learned men had forgotten the origin of the word horū. The Bșhajjātaka sayg 802 'according to some the word horā is obtained from ahorātra by dropping the first and last syllables, that horāśāstra well manifests what the fruition of acts, good or bad, done in previous lives is going to be'. It should be noticed that the Brhajjātaka insists on two matters, viz. (1) it links up the horoscopic astrology to the doctrines of karma and punarjanma (re-incarnation to wipe out karma) and (2) the śāstra holds that the horoscope to be only a map or plan, which indicates future trends in a man's life arising from what he had done in a previous life or in previous lives. It does not here say that the planets in a man's horoscope will compel him to do this or that, but it says that the horoscope will only intimate in what directions a man's future might be evolved. These principles were repeated even by late medieval writers. For example, Raghunandana 803 in his Udvāhatattva (p. 125 ) agrees with the Dipikā that the planets only convey that sins were committed in former lives, but they do not them selves produce evil results and quotes the Matsyapurāņa jn support that 'evil actions done in former lives bear fruit in the present life in the form of diseases, distress and the death of those dear to one'. There was probably a third underlying principle viz. the stars are the temples in which the gods reside,

History of Dharmaśāstra (Sec. II, Ch. XVI 

as said in the Sat. Br. and Tai. Br. 804 The Babylonians 805 and Assyrians based their astrology mainly on three assumptions viz. (1) the stars are temples in which the gods reside; (2) the stars reveal to men the intentions of the gods with regard to the future; (3) human history is predetermined at a heavenly council over which Marduk presides. These, except the first, are entirely different from the principles emphasized by Varāha. mihira and those who came after him. The Babylonians and Greeks had no (generally believed) doctrines of karma and punar janma. Therefore, they could not make astrology serye indirectly a higher purpose, viz, of inducing people to lead a life of virtue in the present. Instead of the somewhat childish and often immoral legends of ancient times the cult of planetary influence and worship seemed to many minds far more rational and con vincing. 

The Sārāvali of Kalyāna-varman follows this and adds 806 that what is known among the people as Jātaka is called horā in this sāstra or the word (horā) may indeed be taken to be & synonym for 'consideration of what the destiny would be'. The word 'horā' has two other meanings in Sanskrit astrology viz. lagna ( that sign which is rising on the eastern horizon at a particular moment) and half a rāśi (Brhajjātaka I, 9). Extravagant claims were made for the importance and utility of astrology and astrologers. The Sārāvali declares : 807 there is no one else except astrology that would serve as a helper of men in acquiring wealth, as a boat in the sea of calamities and as a councillor when one starts on a journey or invasion. Varāha mihira boasts Sos . Even those who have resorted to a forest (i. e.

who have become forest hermits), who are free from worldly attachments and are without property, ask questions of one who knows the movements of heavenly luminaries. As the night without a lamp or the sky without the sun, so a king without an astrologer (with him) wanders about (or wavers ) as a blind man on a road. If there be no astronomer and astrologer, auspicious times, tithis, nakşatras, seasons and the ayanas (northward and southward passages of the sun ),-these would all become confused. What a single astrologer knowing the country and time can effect, that even a thousand elephants or four thousand horsemen cannot accomplish.' 

The Rājamārtanda provides 809 'the purohita (family or palace priest ), an astronomer, a councillor and an astrologer as the fourth – these must always be supported by the king even with great trouble, as in the case of women.' 

It has, however to be noted that Varāhamibira himself frequently gives up the principle that the horoscope is only a map showing tendencies and talks the language of certainty and of the planets causing this or that state of things. To mention one or two examples. In Bṛhaj-jātaka 810 he says the sages declare that a person is born from a paramour for certain (and not from his reputed father ) if in his horoscope Jupiter has no dȚsţi ( aspect) either on the lagna or on the moon or on the sun and moon that are in conjunction (in his horoscope ) or when the moon is in conjunction with the sun and with a malefic planet (Mars or Saturn)'.

ction with a malefic planet in the 1st, 5th, 7th, 8th, 9th or 12th house ( in a horoscope ) causes death ( of the new-born child ) if it is not also in conjunction with powerful Venus, or Mercury or Jupiter or if it is not in aspect with one of those powerful three.' Again in Brhaj-jātaka XIV. 1 it is said: If the sun is in con junction with another planet, he produces the following results, viz, with the moon a man who makes (lethal) machines or works in stones; with Mars a man addicted to evil ways; with Mercury a man who is skilful, intelligent, famous and happy; with Jupiter, a cruel man or one intent on carrying out the objects of others; with Venus a man who makes money by going on the stage ( or in a ring for boxing &c.) or by the use of arms; with Saturn a man clever in metals or different kinds of (merchan dise or) vessels. The Sārāvali very frequently says that such and such a position produces (janaijati, utpādayati ) or causes ( karoti or kuryāt &c.) certain results. Vide chap. 33. 48–61. 

Before proceeding further I must point out that India was not singular in its firm belief in Astrology. The case was the same throughout Europe and among the Greeks after Alexander the Great. It has been already seen (p.521) how Babylonian astrologers made reports to the king about the position of the Sun, the Moon and the planets and what they portended for the country, the king and the people. Vide for example, Nos. 9, 15, 16, 21, 32, 33, 52, 53, 63, 66, 67, 72, 74, 76, 86, 151, 164 from The Reports of the Magicians and Astrologers of Nineveh and Babylon' by R. Campbell Thompson (vol. I and II, Luzac and Co. London, 1900), But horoscopic astrology was developed by them later. In the Old Testament Isaiah (759–710 B. C. ) 47.1 and 5 apostrophize Babylon as the daughter of the Chaldeans and in verse 13 we read * let now the astrologers, the star-gazers, the monthly prognos ticators stand up and save thee from these things that shall come upon thee'. In Daniel 4.7 it is said that on Nebuchadnezzar's order 'came in the magicians, the astrologers, the Chaldeans and the soothsayers. Vide also Daniel 1.20 and 2.2 and 27. The Chaldeans held that the five planets specially controlled men's destinies and five Babylonian deities were identified with them. As Bouchem Leclercq observes (in'L'Astrologie Grecque', p. 572 ) 'Chaldean astrology had lived on a fund of naive ideas, it began at a time 

(Continued from last page) from Sārāvali X. 98 that the Moon must be ksina (waning, i, e, from 8th of dark half to the 8th of the following fortnight) for the application of this rule. 

Chaldeans and Greek Science

when the heavens were deemed to be nothing but a cover of the earth, when all the stars were ranged at small distances on the vault and the planets were supposed to move in the midst of stars like shepherds inspecting their flocks. Greek science having ext ended the world, the influence of stars moved back at enormous distances was not a postulate of common sense' (vido note 748 above ). Herodotus 812 ( II. 82) refers to a peculiar practice of the Egyptians to regard each month and day as sacred to some deity, and says how from the day of a man's birth they determined his fortune, character and the manner of his death. But this has no reference to horoscopic Astrology. The Egyptians knew nothing about the Zodiac before the Alexandrian age. There is no trace of astrology in early Groek astronomical writers and it appears that the Greeks got it from Babylon 813 after Alexander conquered Babylon, when teachers of astrology began to arrive in Greece. The Hellenistic mind was soon completely captivated by astro logy. Before the advent of astrology the Greeks tried to peep into the future by oracles, interpretation of dreams and inspec. tion of the entrails and livers of sacrificed animals, from the flight and cries of birds and from prodigies and unusual occurrences such as eclipses, comets and meteors. Berossus 814, a priest of the god Bel at Babylon, dedicated to his patron Antiochus I Soter (280-261 B. C.) an elaborate work on Baby lonian and Chaldean history and it was he who was instrumental in spreading Babylonian astrology in Greece by first introducing it in his school at Cos, an island not far from the south-western corner of Asia Minor. From Greece astrology spread to Rome about the 2nd century B. C. The signs of the Zodiac became house-hold words in Greece and Rome. Stoics like Posidonius

In the same journal at p. 15 he does not know how horoscopic astrology in Greece originated from the totally different omen type astrology of the preceding millenium,

helped it by defending it. Cato in 815 his work on agriculture warns a farmer against consulting a Chaldean and in 139 B. O. an Edict was passed for expelling Chaldeans from Italy. Diodorus 816 Siculus (a contemporary of Augustus of Rome ) describes the theory and method of the Chaldeans in casting horoscopes. Horace 817 ( died in 8 B, C.) in his ode to Maecenas refers to the influence of the signs Libra, Scorpion and Capricornus and of the protective power of Jove and about bale ful Saturn in his horoscope. Strabo, 818 who died in 24 A. D., averred (XVI. 1.6) that some Chaldeans were skilled in astro nomy and the casting of horoscopes. Petronius (1st century A. D.) describes in his novel Satyricon a dinner in forty pages in which a tray displayed the signs of the zodiac under each of which was placed appropriate food ( vide Will Durant in “Caesar and Christ" page 298, (New York 1944). Juvenal,819 who flourished about the close of the 1st century A. D., strongly inveighs against ladies who have great confidence in Chaldean astrology. It should not, however, be supposed that no dissenting voice was raised against astrology in Rome and medieval Europe, Cicero did not believe in astrology 820 as he said that the planets were too far away (Bouché Leclerq's work p. 572). St. Augustine (354-430 A. D.) in his work 'City of God' calls astrology a delusion.821 There were some points of difference between Baby lonian astrology and Greek astrology, viz. Babylonian astrology originally at least was interested in the State and the royal family, while Greek astrology was interested only in the indi

vidual and Babylonian astrology was a priestly business while in Greece the astrologers were laymen, Astrology became a study of international importance in Europe and was cultivated in the Universities as a subject of real value throughout Europe by the side of astronomy. Its great vogue among even well educated people was due to its apparent scientific structure with its houses, planets, twelve signs and so forth. Allen (in 'Star-crossed Renaissance' Preface p. VIII) says that everybody in the Renaissance period in the West believed to, some extent in astrology. In 'Stars above us' by Prof. E. Zinner, Tycho Brahe is quoted as saying that he prepared every year an astrological forecast for his king (p. 76). Even Copernicus, Galileo and Kepler practised astrology themselves or countenanced its practice. Bacon was prepared to say that there was no fatal necessity in the stars, but they rather incline than compel. Ptolemy's Tetrabiblos reigned supreme for about 1400 years and is even now a work of great authority for those who believe in astrology. It may interest the reader to know that the great German poet, dramatist and philosopher, Goethe 822 (1749-1832), begins his Memoirs by mentioning the aspects of planets at his birth. 

Two circumstances tended to weaken the influence of astro logy in Europe, viz. the giving up of the geocentric theory in favour of the heliocentric theory and the vast additions to astronomical knowledge made during the last two centuries. But it should not be supposed that astrology has become defunct in the West or U. S. A. The immense strain and distress caused by the two world wars provided a powerful fillip for the spread and influence of astrology. Even in papers the circulation of which runs into millions there is a regular astrological feature every day or every week, which tells people what the stars portend for twelve groups of the world's population in the week

The Moon, however, the near the full, was an important obstacle; and the more so as the labour which attended my birth coincided with the hour of her new phase. She retarded my entrance into the world antil the moment had elapsed'. Vide 'Stars above us' by Prof. Zinner p. 68 for Goethe's horoscope.

or on the day mentioned. 823 What benefit the people derive from these prognostications it is difficult to understand. Often the prognostications are extremely vague and not of greater extent than three or four short cryptic sentences. There must be millions of people in each of the twelve groups (such as those born from 23rd September to October 23rd, those born from 24th October to 22nd November and so on). It is said that in U.S.A. alone there are about 25000 registered astrologers. 

Those interested in astrology in general and Greek astrology in particular and those who desire to know how astrology is regarded by many modern scientific minds may read 'L'Astro logie Grecque' by A. Bouchè-Leclercq '(1899, a masterly work in French on Greek Astrology ) pp. 570-593 (for arguments against astrology ); The Royal Art of Astrology 'by Robert 

Eisler (London, 1946), which contains a reasoned and 

· sustained refutation, and Mr. J. C. Gregory's Article on 'Ancient Astrology 'in Nature, vol. 153 pp. 512-515 ( a brief, but instructive and detached survey of astrology from Chaldean times to this day ). The number of books in favour of astro logy or expounding it is large and I do not propose to mention them. One book arrested my attention, viz. Louis de Wohl's Secret service of the sky. On p. 31 ho propounds a doctrine very similar to what Varāha-mihira laid down as the scope of horāśāstra viz. that Astrology has nothing whatso over to do with mere predictions, that it only indicates tenden cies and that human will is free. He began well, but he did not observe his own precepts. On p. 235 he predicts 'I do not be lieve that Mahatma Gandhi will survive the first half of 1939.' This prediction turned out to be untrue and it is well-known that Mahatma Gandhi was killed on the 30th of January 1948. 

The English language itself bears witness to the great influ ence of astrology in England; e. g. such words and expressions as 'ill-starred expedition', 'disastrous consequences', tempera ments being either jovial, mercurial, or saturpine, 'moon–32*

struck (mad) lover'. The word influence (from fluo to flow) itself is due to astrological beliefs and words like aspect', 

conjunction', 'ascendant', 'retrograde' are all due to the language of astrology. 

In support of Astrology Ptolemy (in Tetrabiblos, 1.2) puts forward certain arguments. The Sun not only affects every thing on the earth by the change of season, but by its daily revolutions furnishes heat, moisture, dryness and cold in regular order. The Moon, the nearest heavenly body to the earth, causes the seas to change their tides with its own rising and setting times, and plants and animals wholly or partly wax and wane with the moon. The planets often signify hot, windy and snowy conditions of the air and affect mundane things. The changes of seasons and winds are understood even by very ignorant mon and by some dumb animals. Sailors know the special signs of storms and winds that arise periodically by reason of the aspects of the sun, moon and planets. But because sometimes sailors err, no one says that there is no science of navigation. Therefore, a sufficiently observant man wise enough to know accurately the movements of the sun, moon and planets can predict whether the weather will be warmer or 825 wetter. Why can he not, with respect to an individual, perceive the general quality of his temperament from the surroundings at the time of his birth, as for example that he would be such and such in body and mind? Ptolemy then condemns impostors who do not study the science but deceive common and trusting people and fill their pockets. He further points out that the nativity alone is not the sole basis of judging a person's future, that the country of birth, the 

(Continued from last page) living things' by Prof. George Sarton in Isis vol. 30 (1939) pp. 495-507, where he examines the beliefs about the Moon's connection with lunacy, fides, menstruation, terrestrial magnetism, says that these are matters for experiment, advises scientists to keep an open mind and holds that lagar lofuence is unproved as to some of them. 

825. A short passage from Bouche-Leclercq (p. 574) may be set out here : how to justify the ridiculous associations of ideas attached to the purely imaginary forms of the figures of the Zodiac and the reciprocal lafuence of planets on the signs and of the signs on the planets when these are (one knows this since a long time) at a great distance from the con Mellations and do not appear to be placed there except by the effect of perspective'?

race to which he belongs, the customs of the people among whom he is born, the way in which he is reared, the age in which he lives have also to be considered, all which will contri buto materially to the proper prediction, other things being equal. In IV.10 he points out that if one looks only at the horoscope without paying attention to nationality, manners and customs and the like he may call an Ethiopian fair 8250 of complexion and having straight hair and a German a dark skinned person and endowed with woolly hair or not knowing the peculiar customs say that an Italian whose horoscope is being examined may marry his sister (as ancient Egyptians did) or that the man may marry his mother (as only Persians did ). Vide Tetrabiblos IV. 10 p. 439 (Loeb. cl. Library). In I. 3 Ptolemy argues that astrology is not only possible but is beneficial, because fore-warned is fore-armed. It is a very far cry to argue from the undoubted influence of the Sun and the Moon on mundane matters, such as heat and cold, rains, storms and droughts that the particular positions and aspects of the Sun, Moon and planets at the time of birth or conception ( as some hold ) are throughout an individual's life ( it may be for a day or a hundred years ) the dominating factor (if not the sole factor as many astrologers say ) governing his conduct, character, family affairs and destiny. The reasoning of Ptolemy, though very cleverly put and though with a slight scientific appearance, is rather vague and not at all cogent or convincing. He distin guishes between universal or general astrology (treated of in Books I-II ) which relates to whole countries, races, cities and large bodies of men and particular or genethlialogical astrology treated of in books III-IV. 

825 a. Utpala on Lagbajātaka IV. 1 states similarly that one (the astro loger ) should specify the form (or appearance) of a person after knowing bls caste, since svapākas ( cāndalas) and Disādas are dark-skinned by caste; similarly, he should consider in what family, whether of fair persons or dark persons, the person (whose horoscope is being examined ) was born or in what country, since all people from Karnātaka are dark, people from Videba (i. e, Mithilā, part of present Bihar State) are dark-browo aod from Kashmir fair.

Astrologers to consider country, caste, family 

555 

· Indian works also require the astrologer to consider the customs of the country and of the people. The Rājamārtanda 8256 says. First the usages of people must be considered; whatever is firmly established in the several countries, that alone must be followed; the learned give up what is hateful to the people ; therefore an astrologer should proceed along the people's way. A learned man should never go against the inclinations of the family (to which the person belongs ) and of the country'; and then he gives examples of the astrological requirements as regards planets in the case of marriages in several countries. The general astrology about calamities or occurrences that affect all people spoken of by Ptolemy would fall under sakhā or Samhitā in the narrower sense ( vide notes 688 and 690). Some important and interesting conclusions of Ptolemy may be noted here. 

Ptolemy speaks of beneficent and malefic planets (1.5), of masculine and feminine planets (1.6 ), of diurnal and noctu. rnal (in Sanskrit dinabali and nišābali ) planets (I. 7), (I. 12 ) masculine and feminine rāśis ( signs ), the aspects of the signs (I. 13 ) viz. opposition ( 180 degrees), trine (120°), quartile (90°) and sextile (60°), of the houses ( svagthas in Sanskrit ) of the planets. In Book II he divides the inhabited world into quarters equal in number to the triangular formations of the signs of the zodiac and after a disquisition which would be regarded by modern men as casuistical and practically unintel ligible, Ptolemy sets forth a list of over seventy countries ( then known), assigning to each sign some countries. For example, to Aries he assigns Britain, Gaul, Germania, Bastarnia, Syria, Palestine, Judaea and one more; to Capricorn he assigns India, Ariana, Gedrosia, Thraco, Macedonia, Illyria. The whole of America, almost the whole of Africa (except the northern part), Indonesia and Australia and the other neighbouring lands are not considered by Ptolemy at all, because these were unknown then. He remarks at the end of II. 3 that as to metropolitan cities they should be treated like individuals and their nativity is to be cast by taking the time of the foundation 826 of the city

instead of the times of birth, but where the exact time of foun dation is not known then the nativity of the founder or of the king is to be taken. 

A few important points of agreement and disagreement between Sanskrit astrological works and Ptolemy will be set out later on. 

The literature on muhūrta ( auspicious time for undertaking anything ) is extensive. Almost all works on Kāla mentioned above such as Hemādri on Kāla, the Kāla-madhava, Kalatattva Vivecana, Nirnayasindhu are in a way works on muhūrta, since they discuss the proper times for performing the samskāras and religious rites. Among the works the names of which begin with the word muhūsta are: Muhūrtakalpadruma (published by Nirn. Press, Bombay) composed by Vitthala Dikşita in 1628 A.D.; Muhurta-ganapati composed in 1685 A. D. by Ganapati Raval, son of Harishankar; Muhūrta-cintāmaṇi composed at Benares in sake 1522 (1601 A. D.) by Rāma, son of Ananta, with a com mentary called Piyūşa-dhārā composed in sake 1525 (1604 A.D.) by Govinda, son of Nilakantha elder brother of Rāma (published in 1945 by the Nirn. press); Muhūrtatattva by Gaņeśa, son of Keśava (ms. in Bhau Daji collection of Bombay Asiatic Society); Muhurtadarśana (also called Vidyāmādhaviya) by Vidya madhava with a commentary called Muhurta-dipikā (about 1363 A. D.) by his son Vişnu, edited by Dr. Shamsastri (published

D.), by Nārāyaṇa, son of Ananta, of Tāpara village to the north of the temple of Siva which is to the north of Devagiri, with his own commentary called Mārtapdavallabhā (published by Nirn. Press, 1925); Muhūrtamālā by Raghunatha (mg. in Bhau Daji collection); Muhūrta-muktāvali (incomplete ms. with only 45 verses in the same collection). Out of these, three works alone are now available in print viz. Muhūrta darśana, Muhurta-cintāmaņi and Muhūrta-mārtanda. The rest are mss. ( in Bombay Asiatic Society's Library). In this section on muhūrtas reliance has been placed mainly on the three printed works along with the Jyotisaratnamālā of Sripati (about 1039 A. D.), the Rājamārtanda of Bhoja (ms in B. O. R. I., Poona) and the other works on Kāla. Among the works described as especially dealing with muhūrtas, the most elabo rate are the Muhūrta-cintānani (containing about 480 verses with a very exhaustive commentary) and the Muhūrtadarsana (with about 600 verses) and also a very elaborate commentary. It would not be possible to deal with all matters contained in these works. The Muhūrtamārtapda (containing 161 verses) follows a middle course. According to it the subjects dealt with in it are briefly as follows:--what positions and aspects of the planets, what yogas, what tithis, naksatras, months and conditions of the family and of the mind should be avoided in the case of śubha ( auspicious ) actions; the proper times for samskāras, such as garbhādhāna, pussavana, jātakarma, piercing the infant's ear, caula, upanayana, the end of the period of Vedio study; topics connected with marriage (this takes up 55 Vorses i. e. a little over one-third of the entire work); times for kindling sacred domestic fire (gļhyāgni); times for construction of a house and for first entrance into it; the proper times for starting on a journey or marching against an enemy king; auspicious and inauspicious sakunas (omens or prognostications); times for king's coronation, for wearing of rich clothes and ornaments and for agricultural operations, for sale and purchase of animals (such as cattle, horses ), for bath with sesame and myrobalan, for finding lost articles, for constructing wells and tanks: times when Vedic study should be stopped (anadhyāya ) for long or temporarily; the results of a lizard or chameleon falling on one's body; what planet is inaugpicious or auspicious in which sign from the sign of one's birth; the puṇyakāls of

Sankrāntis. It may be mentioned that many of the provisions about auspicious aspects of planets, about upanayana and marriage, construction of and first entrance into a house, sakunas about the fall of lizards and chameleons were observed in the author's boyhood and are still observed by many, though there is gradually an increasing looseness of observance in these matters. 

It should be noted that even as to sakunas Varāba-mihira puts forward the principle that it is the fruition of actions, good or evil, done in previous lives by men, that is manifested by sakunas for those who start on a journey or invasion, 827 

How people had become almost crazy with the idea of find ing out a muhūrta for everything from shaving, wearing a new garment to such solemn matters as marriage is well illustrated by the provision of a muhūrta for a theft in the Muhūrta muktāvali, viz. the act of thieving succeeds when done on the naksatras Āśleşā, Mrgaśiras, Bharaṇī, Svāti, Dhanisthā, Citra and Anurādhā, on a Saturday or a Tuesday and on a riktā tithi ( 4th, 9th and 14th ). 828 

Before entering on a discussion about individual acts or rites, it is necessary, in order that the reader may understand the prescriptions about muhūrtas, to explain some simple details of Jātaka. To discuss in detail all the details of Jātaka works is much beyond the scope of this work and would necessitate the writing of a volume by itself. A middle course has to be followed. Besides naksatras, their lords and their classifications, one has to bear in mind the rāśis, the planets and the bhāvas (houses or places) in a horoscope. For these reliance will be mainly placed on the Bșhatsamhita and Bșhaj-jātaka of Varāhamihira, the Sārāvali, Jyotisaratnamālā of Sripati, the Rājamārtanda, Jātakālankara of Gaņoša ( composed in sake 1535, 1613-4 A. D.). The 27 or 28 naksatras and their presiding deities have already been enumerated above ( pp. 499-504 and note 731 ). It has to be remembered that the dovatā of a nakşatra is often employed to indicate the naksatra or the tithi itself also. Here the classifica tion of nakşatras will be first discussed.

Classification of nakşatras 

359 

Brhadāraṇyaka Upanişad quoted above (in note 754 ), it is clear that the nakşatras had very early (i. e. about 1000 B.C. at least) been classified as punya ( auspicious ) and pāpa (inauspicious ) and into male and female. The Vedāngajyotisa ( Yājuşa ) gives a classification of nakşatras into ugra and krūra, 829 The naksatras are further classified in the Brhat-sambitā (chap. 97. 6-11) into dhruva ( or sthira = fixed), tiksna (or dāruņa), ugra (or krūra ), ksipra ( or laghu ), mrdu (or maitra), mrdutikspa (or sādhāraṇa or misra), cara ( or cala ). 830 

The Br. S. (97. 6-11 ) states that on Dhruva nakşatras the coronation of a king, śānti ( propitiatory rite for averting impen ding evil or calamity ), planting of trees, foundation of a city, charitable acts, sowing seeds, and other permanent acts should be done; on tiksna nakşatras succeed attempts to harm, the acquisition of mantra (mystic verse or formula ), raising ghosts, arrest (of a person), beating, separating (two friends or) relation ships; ugra nakşatras are to be used for success in extermination, destruction of another's property, cheating, arrest, poisoning, incendiarism, striking with a weapon, killing; kşipra (or laghu) nakşatras are declared as leading to success in sales, in making love, in the acquisition of knowledge, decoration, arts, crafts (such as carpentry), medicines, journeys; the mṛdu naksatras are beneficial in securing friends, sexual affairs, clothes, orna ments, auspicious ceremonies (marriage, upanayana &c.) and singing; the mrdu-tikşpa (or sādhāraña) naksatras produce mixed results ( on which mild or fierce acts may be done); the cara naksatras are beneficial in doing fleeting actions. The Muhūrta-mārtapda provides that wise mon engage in actions similar to the names of the groups of naksatras for attaining success. It should be noticed that some works like the Jyotisa ratnamālā (III. 9 ) and the Muhūrta-cintāmaņi (II. 2-8) hold that Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday are respectively dhruva, cara, ugra, miśra, laghu, mrdu, and tīkşpa and that actions that are appropriate for nakşatras of those groups are appropriately performed on the respective week days. 831 

The Bșhaj-jātaka devotes fourteen verses for the characteri stics of persons born on the 27 nakşatras from Asvinl. Two

Verses are translated for sample : 832 a person born on Asyinis is fond of ornaments, is handsome, has a prepossessing appear ance, is clever (in all things ) and intelligent; one born on Bharaṇis is of firm resolve, truthful, free from disease, clever and free from worry; one born on Kṛttikās is a heavy eater, fond of other's wives, impatient, famous; one born on Rohiņi is truthful, pure, of agreeable speech, of resolute intellect and is handsome. The Rājamārtanda in verses 16-40 sets out the synonyms of 27 naksatras which include the names of the lords of the nakşatras and synonyms of the lords of nakşatras. The Jyotişaratnamālā, Bhujabala and M. C. 2. 22–23 divide 28 naksatras (including Abhijit ) into four groups 833 of seven each, called' andhaksa' (blind), 'mandākşa' (of dim sight), 'madhyākşa' (of medium sight) and 'svaksa' (of good sight) and state that property stolen on 'andhākşa' naksatras may be recove red quickly, stolen on 'mandākşa' naksatras after effort, stolen on 'madhyākşa' (there is no recovery but) the owner may hear that it has been taken to a distant place by the thief; stolen on 'svakşa' or "sulocana' the owner would not recover it nor even hear about its whereabouts. The Bphat-samhita (chap. 14) has already been referred to (on p. 530) in connection with the provinces of India governed by nine groups of nakşatras (three nakgatras in each group) and chapter 15 of the same (1-27) sets out what substances are governed by the 27 nakşatras from Krttikā to Bharapi.834 One verse is translated as a specimen: under Křttikās are white flowers, those who have consecrated the Vedic fires, those who know Vedic mantras, sūtras and bhāşyas (commentaries), officers over mines (or stores), barbers, brāhmaṇas, purohita, astrologers, potters. 

The Brhat-sambitā (104.1-5) declares what naksatras (out of 27) form part of Time looked upon as a puruşa (Person). This is

Nakşatrus as limbs of Prajāpati 

561 

an extension of a very old conception. The Tai. Br. says: *Prajāpati has Hasta-naksatra as his hand, Citrā as his head, Nistyā (i. e. Svāti) as his heart, the two stars of Višākhā as the thighs, Anurādhās as his stability (or support). This is indeed Prajāpati in the form of groups of naksatras ' 835 

From the above it would be noticed that a naksatra astro logy apart from the rāśi astrology had been thoroughly developed in India while Ptolemy is hardly concerned with the naksatras, but concentrates only on rūšis. 

The twelve rūšis are to be found in the Zodiacal belt (or circle ); each extends over 21 naksatras i. e. Mesa extends over Ašvini, Bharani and of Kritikā, Vșsabha extends over of Křttikā, whole of Rohiņi and half of Mrgasirşa and so on. These twelve rāśis from Mesa are identified respectively with the following limbs of the Kālapuruşa 354 viz. the head (Mesa), mouth (Vrsabha), chest, heart, stomach, waist, the abdomen (between the navel and the private parts), the private parts, the pair of thighs, the pair of knees, the two shanks, the two feet. Varāha adds that the words rāśi, kşetra, gȚha, şkşa, bha and bhavanu are used as synonyms in Jātaka. The purpose of the identification of rāśis with the limbs of Kāla put forward by astrological works is that if a malefic planet occupies in a person's horoscope a certain rāśi, he is adversely affected in that limb of his body to which the rāśi corresponds among the limbs of Kāla, but if a beneficent planet occupies at birth a rāsi, then the person prospers as to the corresponding limb. This is succintly put by the Sārāvali (III. 5-6). The twelve rāśis with

VU 

It should be noted that the list of synonyms is not exhaustive; other words with the same meaning are often employed. For example, for Simha, Mrgarāja may be used or for Mina the word prthuroman may be used. The words in italics are deemed by Weber and many others as borrowings from or Sanskrit adapta tions of Greek words. It may be admitted that most of them bear a striking resemblance to Greek names of rūšis. Pathona should be Pāthena to correspond with the Greek word. There is no reason why kulira should be regarded as a Greek word. Kern (preface to Br. S. p. 29 ) thinks that it is a pure Sanskrit word. There is no Greek word corresponding to Kulira in Ptolemy. The word Karka or Karkin appears to mean'white' and occurs as early as in Atharvaveda IV.38. 6-7. All that the Bshaj-jātāka (1.8) means is that there are other words like kriya used for the twelve rāsis in other works. Varāhamihira frequently refers to the views of the Yavanas and sometimes differs from them. It has been shown by me in my paper on Yavaneśvara and Utpala'( in J. of Bombay Asiatic Society, vol. 30, pp. 1-8) that there is a Sanskrit work on astrology called Yavana-jātaka of about 4000 verses composed by a king of the Yavanas called Sphujidhvaja and another Vrddhayavanajātaka also in several thousand verses by Minarāja who styles himself the overlord of Yavanas. I cannot agree with Prof. Sen-Gupta ('Anoient Indian Chronology' p. 99 ) that words like Mesa and Vrsabha in verses like Rg. I. 51.1 (abhi tyam mesam) refer to rāśis, when he himself had to concede that he could not find the other ton in the Rg. 

(Continued from last page) kara says that the last rāši is called 'cettba. (vide Subrahmanya Sastri's translation of Bṛhajjātaka p. 8). The T.S.S. edition of Lewma bas G UIA: FAŞI:' i. e. the last rāśi is called .irthasi'.

Ptolemy employs a Greek word for Pisces (Loeb Classical Library pp. 52, 314, 328 &c. ), to wbich 'ittha' or 'ikthasi' or 'irtbasi' would correspond rather than cettba', The Sāravali (I11. 7) reads H Friluokater Targuty :. That shows that it bad oo Greek word for 'mina ' before it. It may be ooted that the Sārāvali expressly says that is Varāha's work is brief it ( Sārāvali) took essential matters from the exten sive sāstras composed by Yavapaparendra and others I have not been able to find the word ittha or a similar Sanskrit adaptation for Mina in the Brbajjātaka.

TIT 

The appearance of the rāģis is briefly described by the Brbajjātaka 837 1. 5 and explained by Utpala as follows: (Tbe sign Mina i. e. Pisces ) appears as two fishes (each facing the tail of the other), Kumbha appears as a man carrying an empty jar placed on his shoulder, the sign of Gemini is represented as a man carrying a mace and a woman holding a lute, the sign of Sagittarius is a man with a bow whose legs are like those of a horse, the sign Capricorn is a crocodile with the face of a deer, sign of Libra is a person holding scales, the sign Virgo is represented by a maidon in a boat with an ear of corn in one hand and fire in the other; the remaining signs are similar (in form ) to the objects indicated by their names and all signs reside in places appropriate to their names. For more detailed descrip. tions, vide the twelve verses quoted from Yavaneśvara by Utpala which I have quoted and translated in my paper in the Journal of the Bombay Asiatic Society vol. 30 parts 1 and 2 pp. 1-7 and which are found in the Yavana-jātaka of Sphujidh vaja (a palm leaf ms of which exists in the Nepal Durbar Library ) and in the Vrddhayavanajātaka of Minarāja. Those verses also name the special objects and places governed by the different rāśis. Several verses of Kāśyapa are quoted by Utpala on Bș. S. 40 that deal with the materials or things that are under the influence of the several rāśis. For example, Mesa is the lord of garments, woollens, cloth made of the hair of a young goat, of Masūra pulse, wheat, regin, barley, gold and plants that grow on dry land. 838 The Vāmanapurāņa 838a ( chap. 5.45-60 ) describes the appearance of the rāśis and the places and objects they reside in or dominate and the verses closely resemble the wording employed in the two Yavanajātakas of Sphujidhvaja and Minarāja. Some verses are quoted below by way of illustration. From Varāha's description it appears that Mesa, Vrsabha, Karkata, Simha, Vrścika, Makara and Mina are figures of animals (either four-footed or

insects) and the remaining five resemble human beings with special characteristics in each case. These rāśi names have more or less the same meanings in Babylonia, 839 in Europe inclu ding Greece and in India. But it should not be supposed that everywhere the several groups of stars were imagined to be identical with the figures of the same animals or of human beings. In China for instance, the twelve rāśis are rat, ox, tiger, hare, dragon, serpent, horse, sheep, monkey, hen, dog and pig( Encyclo paedia Americana, vol. 29 under the word 'zodiac' and New Funk and Wagnall's Encyclopaedia vol. 36 under Zodiac '1839a. It is further stated that these are still found in some parts of Asia, in Japan and also among the remains of the Aztec race in America. There are many who deny that except for a few signs (like the Scorpion) thera is hardly any very striking similarity between the twelve groups of constellations called Aries &c. and the natural appearance of the objects denoted by the twelve names.840 The origin of the names assigned to Zodiacal signs is unknown. The zodiacal signs named Mesa, Vrsabha &. are purely imaginary, are mere subjective configurations of stars which appear to be in one plane and which appear to certain persons to possess somehow the outline of a scorpion or a lion which are, as modern astronomy tells us, situated at enormous distances (light years as they are called) from each other. The same constellation is often given different names; e. g. the constellation called Great Bear was called by Thales 'the wain' (waggon drawn by horses). The twelve Zodiacal signs are clearly absent from the sacred astronomy of Egypt 841 and the Egyptians know nothing of the Zodiac before the

G. Pinches. On p.167 the latter says that Europe is indebted to the Babyloniads for the names of the signs of the Zodiac except Crab and Archer and sets out the Babylonian names with their meanings and modern names (Ram &c.).

Alexandrian age and very few Zodiacs are older than the Roman times. Since Assyriologists began to reveal the astronomica: knowledge in the valley of the Euphrates, the Babylonian origin of the Zodiac has been taken for granted by almost all scholars.812 The dissenting voice is that of E. J. Webb in Names of stars '8!3 who very strenuously argues against the Babylonian origin of the Zodiacal signs and holds that the Zodiac as we know it is a Greek invention and that Cleostratus who according to Pliny was concerned in forming it lived about 520 B. C. In spite of the vehemence of Webb's arguments, in my humble opinion, he is far from convincing and for the present at least the Babylonian origin of the Zodiacal signs has to be accepted. The passage of Pliny on which Webb relies is differently understood by Prof. J. K. Forheringham.814 The latest work of Sarton on 'History of Science' (1953) holds that the Zodiac had been distinguished by Babylonian astronomers a thousand years before Cleostratus and all that Cleostratus probably did was to divide those constellations into twelve equal lengths of the ecliptic i.e. the twelve signs of the Zodiac. A somewhat amusing argument has been advanced by Hickey 845 that the fact that there are in the sky no animals (figures) suggestive of Egypt or India such as the hippopotamus and the elephant seems to rule out those countries as sources. Is there any logical necessity that certain animals must be introduced in a system of Zodiacal signs if that system originated in a certain country that may be the home of dozens of wild and tame animals? Are all the principal animals of Mesopotamia or of Greece included in the seven animals that figure as signs, if one of the above two was the origin

of the present Zodiacal signs? All the seven animals in the Zodiac are found in abundance in India even now, while some of them may not be found in the present day Greece or Baby lonia. At present I am only concerned to say that out of the three ancient lands, viz. Egypt, Mesopotamia and Greece, Mesopotamia has the greatest claims to be regarded as the source of the Zodiacal signs. The case of India will be dealt with a little later on.

dvisvabhāva ( of both characters ), as saumya (mild ) and krūra ( fierce or malignant ), as dinabala ( powerful by day ), niśābala (powerful by night ), as prşthoduya (rising from the hind part), sirşodaya ( rising by their head first ) or ubhayodaya, and as lords of the four main directions (east &c.). The above table will show at a glance these classifications, in which n. stands for niśābala, d. for dinabala, p. for prşthodaya and s. for sirşodaya. 

The Brhajjātaka compresses these details in I. 10–11 and Utpala explains the purpose of some of these technical terms. Yātrā (invasion ) undertaken on śīrşodaya rāśis yields the desired result but if undertaken on prsthodaya rāśis there is failure and one's army is routed. Those born on krūra signs are of cruel nature and those born on saumya signs are mild by nature, while those born on male signs are energetic and those born on female signs are mild. Those born on cara signs are unsteady by nature, those born on sthira signs are of a fixed nature and those born on dvisvabhāva signs are of mixed chara cter. The knowledge of the signs as lords of quarters is useful in finding out the direction where a person who stole something on a particular sign could be found or the stolen article could be found. Ptolemy's Tetrabiblos I. 11 speaks of Taurus, Leo, Scorpio and Aquarius as solid signs ( sthiru) and Gemini, Virgo Sagittarius, Pisces as bi-corporeal ( dvideha or dvisvibhāva), and in I. 12 there is agreement with Bṛhajjātaka as to the masculine and feminine signs but there is disagreement as to diurnal ( dinabala ) and nocturnal signs ( niśābala ), since Ptolemy holds that Aries and other signs are alternately diurnal or nocturnal, while Varāha holds Aries and the next three and also Sagittarius and Capricornus as nocturnal and the rest diurnal. It does not appear that the Brhajjātaka knows of the commanding and obeying signs (Tetrabiblos I. 14 ) and of signs which behold each other or of disjunct signs (Tetrabiblos I. 15 and 16). The Bṛ, J. (I. 20) and Laghujātaka I. 6 assign the following colours to the twelve rāśis from Mesa onwards viz, red, white, green (like a parrot's body ), dark-red (pink), whitish like smoke, speckled, dark, golden, yellowish, variegated, deep brown (like ichneu mon), white. There is hardly anything corresponding to this in the Tetrabiblos. The rāśis are also divided into four classes viz, anthropomorphic ( Mithuna, Kanya, Tulā, Dhanus forepart, Kumbha), quadruped (Mesa, Vrsa, Simha, Dhanus latter portion, Makara forepart), aquatic (Karkata, Mina, Makara 

1 

Effects of Moon's positions 

569 

latter part ), insect (Scorpion). Vide Tetrabiblos IV. 4 pp. 389 and 391 for slightly varying enumeration. 

Br. J. (chap. 17. 1-12 ) sets out the characteristics of persons born when the Moon was in Mosa and the following rāśis and remarks at the end (in verse 13 ) that the results described will come out fully if the moon, the rāśi it occupies and the lord of that rāśi are powerfu]. In Bṛ. J. I. 19 it is said that two-footed rāśis ( mithuna, kanyā, tulā, kumbha and forepart of dhanus) are powerful by day if they be in kendra; four-footed rāśis ( mesa, vşsa, simha, makara foropart and dhanus latter part ) are power ful at night in kendra position and the rest i. e. watery signs and insect signs (kulira, vrścika, mina and latter part of makara ) are powerful at twilight, when in kendra position. Bļ. J. 18. 20 provides that similar results (as in chap. 17) follow if a person is born when the lagna at his birth is mesa or any one of the other rāśis. 

Planets, their relations to the rāśis and their conjoint influ. ence will now be briefly indicated. We saw above (pp. 493-495) that in the Vedic Samhitās and Brāhmaṇas express references to planets other than Jupiter are almost absent, that in some Vedic Verses five planets and Venus ( as Vena) appear to be referred to. Svarbhānu, the son of an asura, is said to have struck the sun with darkness ( i. e. caused an eclipse ) in Rg. V. 40. 5, 6, 8, 9. In the Chāndogya Upanisad the soul that has acquired true knowledge is said to shake off the body after casting off all evil like a horse ( that casts off dust by ) shaking his hair ( mane and tail) or like the moon becoming free from the mouth of Rāhu. 847 The Maitrāyaṇi Upanişad mentions Sani, Rāhu ( ascending node ) and Ketu ( descending node). 84 But hardly anything is said about the astrological significance of planets in the ancient Vedic Literature. In the Mahābhārata there are plenty of references to the evil influence of planets, but that is restricted to naksatras. Both Rāhu and Ketu are said in Karpaparva to rise in the sky for ( i. e. portending ) the destruc tion of the world. 849 Kautilya offers the curious information that a foreknowledge of rainfall can be had from the position, the motion and the garbhādhāna of Jupiter, from the rising, setting and motion of Venus and from the natural and unnatural

aspects of the sun and that from the sun the sprouting of the seed (can be predicted), from Jupiter the formation of abundant sheaves of corn when the seeds are sown and from the ( movements ) of Venus rainfall (can be predicted ). 850 It will be seen from the above that general or universal ( not individual or horoscopic) astrology like the reports made by royal priests in Mesopotamia was prevalent in India many centuries before Christ. The Brhajjātaka ( II. 2–3 ) enumerates the nine planets, Sun, Moon, Mercury, Mars, Saturn, Jupiter, Venus, Rāhu and Ketu and furnishes some synonyms of all these. 

Observations of planets by the Babylonians go back to 2nd millennium B. C. Venus was the first to be studied. Tables about Venus based on observations are found from 1921-1901851 B. C.; Jupiter and Mars were also observed. Jupiter was held to be normally favourable when he shone brightly or followed the moon, while Mars was the planet of ill-luck, but, if Mars shone weakly or disappeared, its evil influence disappeared. Saturn ab its name indicates ('firm standing one') was regarded mostly a planet of good luck. Various favourable prognostications were made about a child, according as the planets like the Moon, Venus or Jupiter were rising or unfavourable prognostications were made if Mars was rising or if Jupiter or Venus were setting:85! Each planet received a variety of names in the astronomical texts of Babylonia. The teaching that every planet has its exaltation i. e. the strongest pitch of its might and influence when in a particular sign goes back to ancient Babylonia. 853 The arrangements of the order of planets differed at different times. Planet comes from a Greek word meaning a wanderer' and the word was applied to the planets because as compared with the stars they appeared to wander in different ways and at

different times.85€ In modern times there are three more planeta, viz. Uranus, Neptune and Pluto discovered respectively in 1781, 1846 and 1930 A. D.851 Bouché Leclercq mentions that modern astrologers asserted that Chaldeans saw Uranus and Neptune and three other planets (Juno, Vulcan and Pluto), when they had good eyes (p. 573 note 2 of 'L' Astrologie Grecque). 

The Bť. J. (1). 2-3), Sārāvali (IV. 10-11) and Rājamārtanda (verses 8-15) set out the various names for the sun, the moon and the other seven planets. They are specified in the note856 

854. C. V. Macl can on 'labylonian Astrology and its relation to tbe Old Testament' (United Church Publishing House, Toronto) p. 27, Prof. Neugebauer in E. S. A. p. 162 (for arrangements of planets in cuneiform texts in Seleucid period and in Greek horoscopes ). In the Seleucid period the standard arrangement was Jupiter-Venus-Mercury-Saturn--Mars. Ordinary arrangement in Greek horoscopes is Sun, Moon, Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Venus, Mercury. For the planetary week the arrangement in Greece is said to be Saturo-Jupiter-Mars-Sun-Venus-Mercury-Moon, On p. 163 Prof. Neugebauer thinks that Hindu arrangement of planets is obviously Greek in origin for two reasons, as it is based on the arrangement according to distance from the earth and also on a division of days into 24 hours, which is not Babylonian but Hellenistic and ultimately of Egyptian origin. In this latter he can be said to be wrong, as a similar arrangement of week days can be arrived at by relying on the 60 ghatikā system of India. We saw above that horū in Indian astrology has three meanings, viz. Jātaka, lagna and half a siga, but the very early Sanskrit astrological texts at least do not appear to employ the word horā in the sense of 'hour or oth part of tbe whole day or sth part of the day. Any one who asserts that the arrangement of week days is copied from the Greeks must prove two things, (1) the definite time when the Greeks bit upon the particular arrangement of planets for purposes of week-days and (2) the borrowing people had definitely not arrived at the same arrangement before the Greeks, Prof. Neugebauer, so far as I can see, offers hardly ady evi deace on any of these two matters beyond mere assertions and conjectures. It bas further to be remembered that Alberuni (Sachau, vol. I. p. 343) states tbat nobody in India uses the hours except the astrologers, for they speak of the dominants of the hours. The 30 muhurtas of alorūtra are much older than the Satapatha Er, and it was easy to divide a mubūrta into two gadis or ghatikās as the Arthasastra does (I. 19 p. 37 Nālikābhirabarastadba rātrim ca vibhajet) and Purānas like Visnu VI. 3. 6-9 do. There is hardly anything in the vast Sanskrit Literature (of ancient or medieval times) to show that common people or writers ( not being astronomers or astrologers ) employed the method of 24 hours of the day,

below and the names underlined are deemed by Western writers to have been derived from Greek; but it should be noted that no Greek name for the moon occurs in these or other works and I am not convinced that Jiva is a Greek word or adaptation of a Greek word. The word Jiva occurs in the Rgveda itself in 

many places (as in Rg. I. 164.30,X. 18.37) and means - living being, an individual' and in Chandogya Upanisad VI. 3.2 it means ' individual soul'. When Brhaspati came to be regarded as the most prominent of planets and was said to preside over knowledge and happiness (as in Br. J. II. 1. 'Jivo jñāna-sukham') he came to be regarded as the very life of beings and was called Jiva. The Sārāvali (X. 116) says that Bṛhaspati is the life of men (Brhaspatir-nrnam jivah). In Bhujabala it is said 'what will all the planets do to him in whose horoscope Jupiter is in kendra position. A herd of wild elephants is killed by a single lion.'857 The Br. J. and Sārāvali provide that further synonyms may be derived from popular usage. 

In the following some characteristics of the planets (based on Br. J. II. 5-7) are brought together, viz. the colour ruled by each, the lords of each, the direction, element, Veda and class ( brahmana, ksatriya &c.) dominated by each and whether they are beneficent or malefic.

History of Dharmaśāstra 

(Sec. II, Ch. XVI 

In the Yogayātrā VI. 1 a distinction is made between the gods that rule the eight directions and the planets that rule them, Indra, Agni, Yama, Nirrti, Varuna, Vāyu, Yaksa (Kubera ) and Siva are the lords of the eight directions from East to North-East, while the same directions are governed by planets as in the above table. 

The purpose for these classifications is explained as follows: As regards colours ruled by planets, they are useful in indicat ing the colour of the thing lost by or stolen from a man and the colour of the flowers with which the planets are to be worshipped; the lords of the planets are to be worshipped along with the planets in grahapūjā; the direction in which a king should march on an invasion is indicated by planets that rule the directions; according as beneficent or malefic planets are power ful in the horoscope, the character of the person concerned is indicated as good or bad. The Br. J. II. 7 further provides that the Moon, the Sun and Jupiter are lords of sattva-guna, Mercury and Venus of rajo-guņa, Mars and saturn of tamoguņa. Utpala points out that Varāba differs from Yavanośvara, who regards the Sun, Mars and Jupiter as Sattvika, the Moon and Venus as full of rajoguņa, Saturn as having tamoguņa and Mercury taking on the character of the planet with which it is in conjunction.858 Rāhu is the ascending node or the point where the orbit of the moon intersects the ecliptic in passing northwards. Bṛ. J. (II. 8–11) and Laghujātaka II. 13–19 describe the form and appearance of the planets from the Sun to Saturn, giving full rein to association of ideas, imagination and to personification of them. For illustration, I translate one verse ( 10 ) *Jupiter 859 has a large body, his hair and eyes are brownish in colour, he has eminent intellect and has a phlegmatic constitution; Venus is given to pleasures, has handsome body and pretty eyes, has wind and phlegm in his constitution and black but curling. hair on his head.'

It was said that if Jupiter was in his own house (i. e. Dhanus or Mina), then Jupiter also ruled ovor gold. 861 The object of assigning these was practical, viz. the astrologer could judge of the place of birth if the planet was powerful or of the place of the thief or, if a question were put about the food which one invited to a dinner may be served with, the powerful planet would suggest the kind of food. 

The Br. J. (II. 5 ) states that the Sun, Mars and Jupiter are masculine, the Moon and Venus feminine, while Mercury and Saturn are neuter or common (nepuñsaka ). Here Tetrabiblos differs ( I. 6), as it regards Saturn as masculine. Acc. to Bṛ. J. II. 21 the Moon, Mars and Saturn are nocturnal (powerful at night), the Sun, Jupiter and Venus are diurnal (powerful by day) and Mercury is common (both diurnal and nocturnal ). The Tetrabiblos differs (I. 7) by making Venus nocturnal and Saturn diurnal. 

860. Vide Tatrabiblos III. 12 pp. 319 and 321 for parts of the human body governed by planets, which description differs from that of the Br. J.

The relation between planets and the chief metals was, it seems, based on colour similarity. The theory that different planets governed different areas and limbs of the body led to the influence of astrology on medicine,

(Soc. II, Ch. XVI 

Certain rāśis are declared to be the houses ( svagrha) of planets and certain other rāśis as their ucca (exaltation) and certain parts or degrees of the ucca are declared to be paramocca; the 7th rāśi from the ucca is said to be nica i. e. depressed and certain parts (or degrees ) of the latter are said to be paramanica. The Sun and the Moon have each only one rāśi as svagsha, while the other five planets have two each. The following diagram will indicate all this at a glance :

The figures under signs of exaltation and depression are the añīas ( degrees) rospectively of paramocca and paramanica. The explanation offered by Yavanajātaka of Sphujidhvaja and the Vṛddhayavana-jātaka of Minarāja is that the sign of Leo was assigned to the Sun as his house because it is the most powerful sign and Cancer (a watery sign) was assigned to the Moon, and the Sun and the Moon each gave one sign out of the remaining to the other five planets viz. Kanyā, Tulā, Vrścika, Dhanus and Makara were given by the Sun to Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn ( arranged according to distance ) and the Moon gave to the same five planets one each of the rāśis of Mithuna, Vrsabha, Mesa, Mina and Kumbha (vide my paper on ‘Yavaneśvara and Utpala' in J. B. B. R. A. Ş. vol. 30 on p. 9Ptolemy on svagrhas 

577 

for the verses of Minaraja and p. 7 for translation). Tetrabiblos I. 17 practically gives a similar explanation about houses (svagrhas) and I. 19 agrees with Br. J. I. 13 about the exaltation and depression signs. Ptolemy does not give the degrees (of paramocca and paramanica 862 ). 

That rāśi that is occupied by its own lord or has an aspect (drsti ) of its lord or is occupied by Mercury or Jupiter or lias an aspect with them is powerful 863 if it be not occupied by any one or more of the remaining planets or has no aspect with any one of the rest. There is a further provision that Scorpion if it is in the 7th house is powerful, the human signs (Mithuna, Kanyā, Tulā, the forepart of Dhanus and Kumbha ) are powerful in the lagna, the watery signs (Karkata, Mina, latter half of Makara ) are powerful if they occupy the 4th house and the quadrupeds ( Mesa, Vřşa, Simha, latter half of Dhanus, and the forepart of Makara ) are powerful in the 10th house (Br. J. I. 17.) 

The natural powerfulness of planets is in the following order: Saturn, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, the Moon, the Sun, each succeeding one is more powerful than each preceding one; if the power of any two or more is equal in other respects, then one has to take into consideration this natural powerfulness for determining which is more powerful. 564 

The astrological houses in a horoscope are twelve and each is expressed by various synonyms, many of which indicate what particular matters are to be judged from the state of that house. They are enumerated in Br. J. I. 15-19, Laghujātaka I. 15-19, Sārāvali III. 26-33.

It should be noted that the appellations given to these bhāvas are of two classes, (1) those which are used as mere designations, without indicating the special function of the house, such as horā, duścikya, meşūrana, rihpha, caturasra; the second class of these appellations conveys the special functions of the houses, such as tanu (body), sva ( wealth) or kutumba (family ), sahaja ( brothers ). 

There are certain appellations that apply to a number of houses. The 1st, 4th, 7th and 10th houses are all called kantaka, kendra, catustaya, the houses beyond the kendra are called paņaphara ( 2nd, 5th, 8th and 11th ), the 3rd, 6th, 9th and 12th houses are called A poklima, 6th, 8th and 12th houses are called trika; the 3rd, 6th, 10th and 11th houges are called upacaya and the rest are called apacaya. Garga held that the 3rd, 6th, 10th and 11th are called upacaya only if there is no aspect of them with malefic planets or with the enemy of the lord of them. Trikoņa is claimed to be a Greek word. 

From the several names of the bhāvas, it appears that the following were to be predicted from the several bhāvas; from first bhāva, health and the growth of the body; from 2nd the 

Prognostications froin twelie bhāvas

wealth of one's family; from 3rd brothers (and sisters ) and valour; from 4th relatives friends, happiness, house and mother; from 5th sons, intellect, learning; from 6th enemies and wounds; from 7th wife, love affairs., marriage; from 8th death, one's foibles and sins; from 9th dharma, elders (including parents ), austerities; from 10th acticns and dignities or position and father; from 11th acquisition of good qualities and of wealth; from 12th expenditure, debts. 

Thibaut (in Grundriss p. 68 ) following Jacobi boldly asserts that the doctrine of the twelve astrological houses which is a chief point in the Indian system found developed in Varāha mihira does not occur among Western authorities earlier than Firmicus Maternus ( middle of 4th century A. D.) and that Greek astrology entered into India only between Firmicus and Varāhamihira. One is regretfully constrained to say that this is a case of one blind man following another. In the first place the conception of houses ( bhāvas ) is not totally absent even in Ptolemy's Tetrabiblos, as can be seen in II. 8 p. 191, III, 10 pp. 273-275 (Loeb Classical Library), where houses I, VII, IX, X and XI are referred to, though Ptolemy does not pay much attention to the system of bhūras. Probably this escaped the attention of both Jacobi and Thibaut. In the second place, the system of bhāvas does not occur for the first time in Varāba. Varāha refers to a host of Indian writers before him as will be shown below in whose works the system appears in a fully developed form. It is not possible to believe that all this vast literature was developed in a hundred years or so after Firmicus. Besides, authors like Garga, Parāśara, who are placed between the Vedāngajyotisa and the siddhāntas ( about 800 B.C. to 250 A.D.) know this system and Garga is assigned to 50 B.C. by Kern (Preface to Bṛ.S. p.50). Thibaut, a great scholar, proposing to write an encyclopaedic work on Jyotisa is content to rely on Jacobi and does not appear to have cared to see for himself even Ptolemy and examine works like the Atharvana Jyotisa, the Vaikhānasasūtra, Visnudharmottara which teach astrology based on naksatras. This, to say the least, is most surprising. Prof. Zinner ( in 'Stars above us') p. 67 says that the twelve houses denote life, business, brothers, father, sons, health, wife, death, religion, gain, good deeds, gaol. In the 3rd place Thibaut takes no account of Sanskrit works written by Yavanas settled in India, to whom Varaba frequently refers, from whom he sometimes differs on vital points of doctrine and from whom Utpala quotes hundreds of versos, 

580 

History of Dharmaśāstru 

(Sec. II, Ch. XVI 

which are found in the ancient Yavanajātaka of Sphujidhvaja. Fur ther, it has been shown above (pp. 533-34 ) that extant references to astrology based on naksatras actually exhibit the names of at least five bhāvas centuries before Firmicus. It is quite possible to argue that Firmicus borrowed his astrology from the predecessors of Varāha, who were Greeks and wrote in Sanskrit, or that even Ptolemy did so as he knows of the bhāvas, but 

furnishes only a dilettante treatment. It may be further noted - that no adaptations of Greek words for all the bhāvas from the 

first to the twelfth are to be found in Sanskrit works. Such words occur only for some viz. Ist, 3rd, 4th, 7th, 10th and 12th bhāvas and for groups of a few bhāvas ( such as kendra, pana phara and āpoclima). Besides, the peculiar points to be deduced from the several bhāvas as stated in Br. J do not all agree with what Firmicus says. Varāha designates the 2nd bhāva as kutumba and sva (family, wealth ) while Firmicus calls it 'lucrum' (how one shall earn one's living); the 11th bhāva is called āya (income) and bhāva by Varāha while Firmicus calls it the house of good deeds; in Firmicus the 4th bhāva is that of father or parents, while Varaha calls it 'bandhu'(relatives ) and gļha in B:. J. and ‘suhrt'( friends ) in Laghujātaka and some later Indian writers say that 4th and 10th bhāvas are respectively of the mother and father. In Firmicus the 6th and 12th bhāvas are respectively wealth and jail, while Varāha bolds them to be 'enmity' and 'expenditure'. 

Certain technical words have yet to be explained. One meaning of horā is half a rūši. In the case of the rāśis of odd numbers ( viz. 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11 ) the lord of the first half is the sun and that of the 2nd half is the moon, while in the case of rāsis of even numbers (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 ) the lord of the 1st half is the moon and of the 2nd half the sun (Br. J. I. 11). The purpose of this is that those born on sun's horā are energetic ( assertive) by nature and those born on moon's horā are mild by nature. Bṛ. J. (I. 12) mentions the view of some 865 (of 

865. केचित्त होरां प्रथमा भपस्य वाञ्छन्ति लाभाधिपतोद्वितीयम् । देवाणसंज्ञामपि वर्णयन्ति TETES TERTISITI TE WA I. 12; fate quotes on this a verse of gaat 'आद्या तु होरा भवनस्य पत्युरेकादश क्षेत्रपतद्वितीया । स्वद्वादशैकादशराशिपानां देष्काणसंज्ञाः क्रमशस्त्रयोत्र ॥'. This verse occurs in the यवनजातक of स्फुजिध्वज on folio 2. It would be noticed that one पाद is the same in both बृहज्जा. and यवनजातक. Ja the worsta of 

P TG ( Nepal ms.) the 24 horās of the 12 rāśis are described at length in about 48 rather poetic verses and it wiods up the descriptioo with the words 'garai EITT Yaaroprii H agurauf!!)13 (folio 9.) 

Lords of horas

Yavanesyara, according to Utpala ) that the lord of the first horā is the same as the lord of the rāśi and the lord of the second horā is the lord of the 11th house in the horoscope. The result of this view would be that all planets can be lords of horās and not the sun and the moon alone as Varāha, Satya and others say. Each rasi (of 30 degrees) is divided into three parts, each of 10 degrees, called dreskāna or drekkāņa or drkāņa or drgāna ( in Bṛ. J. III. 5, probably for the sake of the metre ). The lords of the three parts of each rāśi are respectively the lord of the rāśi itself ( of the first part), the lord of the 5th rāśi ( of the 2nd part ) and the lord of the 9th rāśi ( of the 3rd part). For example, in the case of Vrsabha (of which the lord is Venus ), the lords of the 1st, 2nd and 3rd parts are respectively Venus, Mercury (lord of 5th from Vrsabha) and Saturn ( lord of 9th from Vrsabha). And go on for the other rāśis. 

A few words must be said about dreskāņa. Weber and others think that it represents the Greek word 'decanoi'. The 

dekans' were a legacy from ancient Egypt, which 366 had origi nally no zodiacal signs. Bouché-Leclercq has discussed 867 the question of decans at great length in his 'L' Astrologie Grecque' pp. 215–240. The decanal system can be traced as far back as the third dynasty of Egypt (about 2800 B. C.) and may be older still. Originally, the decans were conspicuous stars or groups of stars rising at particular hours of the night during 36 successive periods of ton days each that constituted the year in Egypt. The series began with Sirius and they were distributed in a wide equatorial belt. The ancient Egyptians had a fixed idea that each division of time, large or small, must have its protective tutelary deity. Therefore, the decans were originally the divinities (or genii ) that presided over the 36 decades of the Egyptian year. Each period of ten days was marked by the rising of the next decan on the eastern horizon at sunset. Bouché Leclercq points out that in the Egyptian language a specific name (like the Greek word 'decanos') is not met with and that the decans are designated by a number of synonyms. When the Zodiacal signs were introduced in Egypt by the

Greeks, the tutelary spirits slipped into or got intertwined with the signs of the Zodiac (each sign of 30 degrees being divided into decans of 10 degrees) and played an important part in astrology. The original division referred to the equator, while the later distribution of 36 decans among the twelve signs refers to the 868 ecliptic. Bouché Leclercq avers (p. 53 ) that it has been proved beyond doubt that the Egyptian Zodiacs ( they had four, viz. 2 at Denderah, one at Esneh and one at Akhnum ) are all of the Roman epoch and are imitations of the Greek Zodiac. 

The Brhajjātaka has a special chapter 27 (in 36 verses ) called dreśkāņādhyāya in which the 36 presiding deities of dreśkāņas are described. This chapter appears to conserve the ancient Egyptian conception of the decans as guardian 869 divi nities. The language must be regarded as rather metaphorical or symbolic. It is parts of the Zodiac that are being described. Nearly two-thirds of 36 are male and the rest are female. Some composite figures of males and females and quadrupeds or birds or serpents occur. In verses 2, 19 and 21 (of chap. 27) Varāha expressly says that he only sets out what the Yavanas have said. 

868. Vide Webb in Journal of Hellenistic Studies, vol. 48 (1925) p. 56, Prof. Neugebauer in E. S. A. pp. 81-83. The latter gotes that with the exception of Sirius and its neighbours decans have defied identification with koowo constellations. Vide Prof. Neugebauer's latest note on The Egyptian Decans'in 'Vistas in Astronomy' (ed. A. Beer, vol. I. pp. 47-51). 

869. Vide for 'Dreskāna' Colebrooke's Miscellaneous essays, vol. II. pp. 364-373. Colebrooke (on pp. 370-71 ) states that Manilius employs the word Decania, that Firmicus differs in the names and does not allow the complete degrees to each decanus. This would show that the Bṛ. J. could not have followed about dreskāna Firmicus in astrology as Jacobi suppo sed but some other more ancient author. Nor can it be said that the Br J. follows Manilius. The description of the middle dreşkāņa of Meşa ratber resembles the rotund figure in Plate 10 in Prof. Neugebauer's book "Exact Sciences in Antiquity'p. 83, which plate reproduces the representation of the Decan deities on the tomb of Senmut (in Egypt), B. L. Van Der Waerden in his paper • Babyloniao Astronomy; thirty-six stars' in Journal of Near East Stadies, vol. VIII (pp. 6-26 ) shows how thirty-six stars from old Babylonian times finally became mixed up with the twelve Zodiaca! sigas and 36 Egyptian decaos. Oo p. 8 he gives lists of 36 constellations, the so called 'decans', which were found on coffin lids of the middle king dom in Egypt and on ceilings of tombs belonging to kings of the New Kiogdom. The risings, culminations and settings of decan constellations were supposed to determine not only the date but also the time of the night. On p. 20 he gives a table of Babyloniao stars and their modern equiva lent stars and their times. 

Description of dreşkānas 

583 

Here I translate two verses (2 and 21 ) 'the Yavanas have declared the form of the middle dreskāņa of Mesa sign ( Aries ) viz. she is a female clad in red garments, intent on ornaments and food, has the mouth of a horse and has a jar-like (i, e. rotund ) form, she is oppressed by thirst and is standing on one leg '; 'the Yavanas have declared the appearance of the last dreskāņa of Tula (Scales) as a male having the form of a monkey, decked with ornaments, frightening deer in a forest, wearing golden armour and quiver, and holding fruits and flesh ( in his hands )'. There is nothing in the Tetrabiblos of Ptolemy corres ponding to this and Varāha probably refers to a Sanskrit work by a Yavana writer much earlier than even Ptolemy and Mani lius. Manilius, author of 'Astronomica', a didactic poem on astrology, referred to the decans but he wrote about 9 A. D. and it appears that decans had gone out of vogue in Greece by the time of Ptolemy. Bouché-Leclercq notes (p. 219) that the system of decans is a characteristic of Manilius and that after him one does not hear it spoken of any longer. On p. 219 of his work Bouché-Leclercq furnishes a figure of the Decans of Manilius, which is entirely different from the descriptions of decans given by Br. J. Manilius divides each sign into three parts, each of which represents no deity but the signs themselves. For example, Aries is divided into three parts and those three are the same as Arios, Taurus and Gemini. The Sārāvali 8694 in chap. 49 devotes thirty-six verses to the description of 36 dreskānas, but the des cription differs from that of the Br. J. as the note below will show. The Sārāvali had probably before it a Sanskrit yarana work different from the one relied upon by Br. J. 

Some other technical words may be mentioned and defined here. The six items, viz. the rāši of a planet, the horā, droskāna, navāmsa, dvādaśāmśa and triśāmśa of the rāśi are each called the varga or Sad-varga of that planet (Br. J. I. 9). The first navāmģa of Mesa, Karki, Tūlā and Makara ( that are cara signs )

is called Vargottama, so also the 5th navāmśa of Vrsabha, Simha, Vrscika and Kumbha (that are sthira ), and the 9th navāmsa of Mithuna, Kangā, Dhanus, Mina ( that are dvisrabhūra) are called Vargottama (Br. J. I. 14) and they yield beneficent results.870 The vargottama-navāmśas of all rāśis bear the same names as the rāśis themselves. The Yoga called Sunaphā occurs when some planet other than the sun occupies the 2nd house from that occupied by the Moon; the Yoga Anaphā occurs when some planet other than the sun occupies the 12th house from that occupied by the Moon and Durudharā occurs when planets occupy the 2nd and 12th houses from that occupied by the Moon. The Yoga called Kema-druma occurs when the above three don't occur and the Moon is not in kendra position or if kendra is not occupied by any of the planets (except the Sun). Br. J. 13. 4 notices that varieties of Anapha and Sunaphā are 31 each and the varieties of Durudharā are 180. The Bș. J. does not devote more than 6 verses to all these four yogas but the Vṛddha-Yavanajātaka of Minarāja has 30 verses on Anaphā, 30 verses on Sunaphā, 172 verses on Durudharā. The rāśi which is 2nd from the rāsi occupied by the Sun in a horoscope is called 'Veši' (Bț. J. I. 20). All the above five words are said to be Greek, The word 'liptā' meaning 60th part of a degree' is also said to be Greek. The word 'harija' occurring in Br. J.V.17 means 'horizon'and Kern says it is adapted from Greek (Preface to Bț. . p. 29 ).8704 The Greek word is horos ( boundary ). All the words used by Varāha and supposed to be Greek by Weber, Kern and others may be brought together in one place here ( 37 in all); Kriya, Tāyuri, Jituma, Kulira, Leya, Pāthena, Jūka, Kaurpya, Tauksika, Akokera, Hrdroga, Ittha (?); Heli, Āra, Himna, Jiva, Asphujit, Kona; horā, droskāna, kendra, trikoņa, panaphara, āpoklima, mesūrana, duścikya, hibuka, jāmitra, dyūna, rihpha, anaphā, sunaphā, durudharā, kemadruma, vesi, liptā, harija. I dispute the derivation of kulira and trikona from Greek and Kern agrees that they are pure Sanskrit words. I also doubt whether Jiva is an adaptation of Zeus. Zeus

agrees with Sanskrit Dyaus and not with Jiva and Zeus is an Indo-European word meaning 'Heaven' or 'sky'. The different forms of the word dreşkāņa or 'dyūtam' for 'dyūnam' should not be separately counted. The word horā is used in early Indian astrology in three different senses, none of which agrees with the sense of hour. It is possible that even in Greek it is a word borrowed from Egypt or Babylonia, since in the definite sense of an hour, it is much later and it is doubtful whether Hipparchus (140 B. C.) uses it in that sense. If we exclude these four words only 33 words may at the most be argued to have been adapted from Greek. Some of these words such as the 12 names of rāģis and six of the planets, some names of the bhāras like hibuka, jāmitra, dyūna and kendra have several synonyms ( sometimes by the dozen ) in Sanskrit employed in Br. J. and so no emphasis should be laid on them. They were mentioned by Br. J. because they had been employed by ancient Greek authors who wrote in Sanskrit and so Br. J. took cognisance of them for the sake of completeness of treatment. Even kendra meaning ist, 4th, 7th and 10th houses or bhāvas has two Sanskrit synonyms 'kaptaka' and catustaya', besides the fact that its meaning is different in San skrit astrology from the meaning of the Greek word (kentron, spike). Therefore, barely ten Greek words like Anaphā, Sunaphā remain which have a very minor role to play in Indian astrology and it is a far cry to argue or assert from the occurrence of these few words that the whole Indian astrology as developed in Varāha mihira was borrowed from Greek works. It is extremely doubtful whether any Indians except a few sages or gymnosophists ever went to Greece or lived long in Greece or settled there and returned to India to spread Greek words and astrological know ledge in India; but we have ample evidence that Greeks settled in India, composed inscriptions in Sanskrit and wrote extensive works on astrology in Sanskrit. Vide 'L'Astrologie Grecque' by Bouché-Grecque p. XIX for the Greek. Latin, French names and astrological symbols of the signs of the zodiac and planets and G. R. Kaye in Memoir No. 18 of the Archaeo logical Survey of India pp. 39-40 (for the Greek twelve names of Zodiacal signs and nine other Greek words occurring in Br. J.) and p. 100 for Greek 'bhāyas' and symbols for signs and planets. 

A good deal is said in Br. J. II. 15-17, Laghujātaka II. 10-12, Sārāvali IV, 28-31, Muhurta-cintamani (VI. 27-28 ) and other works about the planets being friends, enemies or indifferent

It may be noticed that there is no reciprocity for these relationships.

According to the Yavanas no planet is sama ( neither friend nor foo) but that planets are either friends or enemies. 871 

As regards temporary friendships and enmities the following rules apply; when planets are in 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 10th, 11th or 12th places from each other they become friends for the occasion (such as marriage, invasion or journey &c.), otherwise they become enemies when in the same rāśi or in 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th or

3th from each other. There are differences of opinion here but they are passed over. 

The bala ( strength) of planets is of four kinds ( arises in four ways ) viz. place, direction, activity ( ceştā), time. A planet is powerful in its position when it is in its own house or in exaltation (ucca) or in its friend's house or in its trıkoņa or navāmsa. This is sthānabala. Mercury and Jupiter are powerful in the east ( i. e. when they are in the lagna ), the Sun and Mars in the south (i. e, in the 10th house ), Saturn in the West (i. e. 7th house ), the Moon and Venus are powerful in the north ( i. e. 4th house). This is digbala. The Sun and Moon are powerful in the northern ayana 872 ( i. e. in the six rāśis from Capricorn); the remaining planets are powerful when they are retrograde or in conjunction with the Moon or when there is a fight ( between planets other than the Sun and the Moon ), the one to the north being more powerful. Garga quoted in the Adbhutasāgara says that grahayuddhu (fight of planets) occurs when one planet occults the other, or when it slightly covers, or when the light of one throws into the background the light of another or when one planet is to the left of the other slightly. This is ceştābala. The Moon, Mars and Saturn are powerful at night, Mercury is powerful both by day and night, and others are powerful by day; krūra and saumya planets are respectively powerful in the dark half and bright half of the month; a planet is powerful in the year of which he is the lord, or on his own week-day or horā or in

Conjunction of planets is of three kinds; when any planet is in conjunction with the sun, that is called astamaya (setting), when in conjunction with the moon it is called samāgaina, when the other planets, Mars &c. are in conjunction with each other that is called yuddha ( fight of the planets); (in the case of yuddba) tbat planet which is to the north of the other is called victorious or power ful (except in the case of Venus tbat is powerful when to the south of the other}. i 135i prua AHSHIRT JI 34FETI TETTI gatall FIT p. 207.

the month of which he is the lord. This is kūlabalı. 873 Yavane śvara says' for ten days from the 1st tithi of the bright half the Moon is of middling power but in the next period of ten daya (from sukla 11th to krsna ) 5th Moon's power is highest and in the last ten days (from krsna 6th to amūrūsyā) the Moon has slight power; but if Moon has an aspect with saumya planets (Jupiter &c. ) he is always powerful. 

A planet is said by Sārāvali to have nine vicissitudes, 874 dipta (blazing, when it is in exaltation), stastha ( at ease when it is in its svagrha ), nudita ( glad, when it is in a friend's stagrha ), śānta ( quiet, when it is in an auspicious zarga), sakta ( capable, when it is shining brightly ), nipidita ( oppressed, when it is overwhelmed by another planet ), bhita (frightened, when it is in depression ), vikala ( impaired when its light is lost is Sun's light), khala ( evil, when it is in the midst of evil company ). The Sārāvali ( V.5-13 ) describes at length the results of a planet being in these nine conditions. 

How even mythological accounts are pressed into service by astrological works may be well illustrated by two verses from the Yogayātrā of Varāhamihira: 'The Sun was born in Anga (Bengal), the Moon among Yavanas, Mars in Avanti ( Ujjayini), Mercury in Magadha, Jupiter in Sindhu, Venus in Bhojakata, Saturn in Surāstra ( Kathiawar ), Ketu among Mlecchas and Rāhu in Kalinga; if these planets are affected, they cause distress to the countries in which they were born: hence a king should invade the respective countries when any one or more of the planets are affected. 875

Doctrine of drsti 

589 

A very important doctrine of Indian astrology is that of drşti (lit. glance, i. e aspect ). The Br. J. II. 13, Laghujātaka II. 8, Sārāyali IV. 32-33, Muhūrtadarśana I. 27 lay down the following rules. All planets 876 have a full aspect (pūrna.drsti) on the 7th house from the one which each occupies. Besides, Saturn has full aspect on the 3rd and 10th rāśi from the one which it occupies and on the planet which is 3rd or 10th from its own position. Similarly, Jupiter has full aspect on the 5th and 9th rāsi from the one it occupies and also on the planet that is 5th or 9th from itself; Mars has full drsti on the 4th and 8th rāśis and the planet in the same. So the Sun, Moon, Mercury and Venus have full drsti only on the 7th rāśi from the one each of them occupies and on the planet that is 7th from them. Besides, all planets have 1/4th drsti on the 3rd and 10th, half drsti on 5th and 9th, dřsti on 4th and 9th. There is no aspect of any planet on any rāśi or sthāna except the seven expressly mentioned (viz. 3rd, 4th, 5th, 7th, 8th, 9th and 10th ) and in the case of partial dụstis the fruit also is partial (i. e. 1, or :). The Tetrabiblos (I. 13 and 20 ) treats of four aspects viz. opposition (7th house of Varaha), trine ( 5th and 9th houses ), quartile ( 4th and 10th ), sextile ( difference of 60 degrees and two signs) and does not distinguish between fractions of drsțis as Varāha does. So in the matter of aspects also there is substantial difference between Ptolemy and Varāha-mihira. 

Another important doctrine is that of gocara. It means 8769 the consideration about the auspicious or inauspicious positions of planets at any particular period in question in places either

In verse 2 atig says that the planets move one above the other, but, on account of the great distances, to the human eye they appear level with each other. The TECreat describes at length the results to different countries and peoples of yuddha between different planets.

ILLS 

declared auspicious or inauspicious judging from the rāśi of birth, The Muhūrta-cintāmaņi in five verses (of chap. 4) deals with this subject. I shall illustrate the application of the word by some examples. If the Sun is in the 6th place from the rāśi of birth he is auspicious but if at the same time the 12th place from the rāśi of birth is occupied by other planets (except Saturn), then, though auspicious by himself, he becomes inauspicious. This result does not arise in case one planet is the father or son of the other (as Saturn is the son of the Sun and Mercury is the son of the Moon). Similarly, if Mercury is in 2nd place from rāśi of birth or in the 4th or 6th or 8th or 10th or 11th and other planets (except the Moon who is the father of Mercury ) are respectively in the 5th, 3rd, 9th, 1st, 8th or 12th, Mercury, though originally auspicious, becomes inauspicious for the time being. Kāraka is another word to be explained. It is rather compli cated. Br. J. XXII and Sārāvali 8766 Vl. and VII, deal with it. As many planets as occupy their own grha or ucca or Mulatri koma and also are in the 1st, 4th, 7th and 10th places ( in the horoscope ) they become Kārakas of each other, while the planet that is in the 10th place (in horoscope ) is specially kāraka. Suppose the lagna is Karka and the moon occupies it (it is moon's svagrha ) and Mars, Saturn, the Sun and Jupiter are in their uccas (i. e. in Makara, Tula, Mesa and Karkata respec tively), they are all kārakas of each other. Many more rules are given in this matter in Br, J. XXII. and Sārāvali VI. The Sārāvali gives ( VII. 7-13) another meaning. Each planet is specially concerned with, rules over or produces several matters or persons &c. I shall quote two verses. The Moon is the lord of poets, flowers, edibles, precious stones, silver, conch, salt, waters, clothes, ornaments, women, ghee, sesame, oils and sleep. Jupiter is the lord of auspicious things, dharma, rites for prosperity, greatness, education, orders, cities and nations, vehicles, seats, beds, gold, corn, dwelling house and sons. 

Then there is the doctrine of dusūs and antardašūs of the seven planets. In the Vimsottarī system man's maximum life is supposed to be 120 years and in Astottarī it is supposed to be 108 and those are distributed among the planets in varying numbers of years and it is said that daśās have further

divisions of antardaśās. This doctrine is elaborated in the 8th chapter of the Brhajjātaka and Utpala quotes numerous verses from Yavaneśvara on this. The theory of Astakavarga is set out by Varāba in chapter 9 of the Brhajjātaka viz. that the seven planets and lagna are eight entities and they produce their fullest or auspicious results only when they are in particular houses and at particular periods of a man's life. All this has to be passed over for reasons of space. 

In the Brhatsaṁhitā, the Bșhaj-jātaka, and the two works on Yātrā, Varāhamihira mentions a host of his predecessors in astrology. In my paper on Varāhamihira and Utpala' (JBBRAS, N. S. vol. 24-25, 1948-49, pp. 1–31 ) I brought together the names of all the predecessors of Varāhamihira and gave extensive references to them in his works. That paper may not be available to all readers of this volume of the History of Dharmaśāstra and therefore I propose to give a brief abstract of it here for ready reference. Purely astronomical writers or works have been generally not included in the following list : Atri ( who acc. to Br. S. 45. 1 wrote a work on utpūtas for which Garga gave him instruction, or who was the disciple of Garga); Bādarāyana 877 (named in Br. 8. 39.1) from whom about one hundred verses are quoted by Utpala in his several commentarios, in one of which on Br J. VI. 2 the view of Yavanendra on the premature death of a child is cited; Bhāguri (Bp. S. 85. 1 mentions him as an ancient author on sakunas ); Bhāradvāja (mentioned in Br. S. 85. 2 as an author on whose treatise king Dravyavardhana of Ujjayini based his own work on sakunas); Bhrgu (Bṛ. S. 85. 43 ); Cyavana (Br. Y. 29. 3); Devala (mentioned in Br, S. 7. 15 for the four motions of Mercury such as straight, retrograde and on Yogayātrā IX. 12); Devasvāmin (mentioned in Br. J. VII. 7); Dravyavardhana (mentioned as king of Ujjayini and as an author on sakunas); Garga 878 (over three hundred verses of Garga are quoted by Utpala in his commentary on Br. S. alone, a work called Mayūracitraka is ascribed to him by Utpala on Br. S 35. 3 and on Br. S. I 5 Utpala quotes three verses of Garga about Vedāngajyotisa, about his deriving astronomy from it and about other sages

VII. 1 with Yavana, Manittha and Parāśara on the topic of length of life, on Br. J. VII, 13 an āryā verse of Maya is quoted by Utpala and to Maya king of dānavas the science of Jyotisa was imparted by the Sun, as stated in the last chapter of the extant Sūryasiddhānta and in a verse quoted by Utpala on Br.

S. 16. 41 cites a verse of Garga which clearly shows his acquaintance with the Raši system; \# TET FIETSTEUT À FENT ET FEUTA: THEET: \# पुष्णाति परिग्रहम् ॥7.

XII, 2 mentions Parāśara as having spoken of two Yogas called Srak and Sarpa); Pauliša (vide pp. 515-517 above), almost all quotations in Utpali are on purely astronomical matters, except that on Br. J. II. 20 Utpala quotes half an ūryū of astrological character; Pitāmaha (reputed author of one of the five siddhantas, from Br. S. 1. 4 it appears that Pitāmalia regarded Tuesday as inauspicious); Ratnā vali (mentioned in Brhadyoga-yātrā II. 1 ); Rsiputra (Br. S. 48. 85 names him and then Br. S. quotes 15 verses from him, Utpala quotes about 20 Anuştubha verses from him on different verses of Br. S. and a long prose passage on Br.

J. such as on VII. 3, 9-11, 13, XII. 2, XX. 10, and in Brhadyog:yātrā XI. 34, about 90 ūryūs being quoted by Utpala on Br. J. alone, in Br. J.

about the length of life to be judged from a horoscope, in Bļ. J.

J. VII. 1, VIII. 9, XI. 1, XXI. 3, XXVII. 19 and 21, Laghujātaka IX. 6 about Veši, Utpala on VIII, 9 refers to Puranayavana-mata and Sārāvali 21. 11 mentions pūrvayavanendras; vide paper on 'Varāhamihira and 

Utpala' pp. 19–21 and on ‘Yavaneśvara and Utpala 'JBAS, vol. for 1957, pp. 1-5). 

The vast literature presupposed by these numerous authors cannot be compressed as said above within the brief space of a hundred years or so but requires the lapse of several centuries. From Garga, who is assigned to 50 B. C. by Kern to Varāha mihira there is a period of about five centuries which might be held to suffice for the production of this vast astrological literature. Garga himself knew the rāśi system, the system of the exaltation of planets and of dṛştis as the quotation in note 879 will show. Ptolemy came at least two hundred years after Garga and Firmicus four hundred years after him. Therefore there is nothing to prove that the rāśi system in India was borrowed from Greek authors. The Greeks themselves got their inspiration for horoscopic astrology from Babylon after the invasion of Alexander in 4th century B. C. and particularly after Berossus. 

It would be necessary to say something about the signs of the Zodiac. The word Zodiac is derived from a Greek word * Zodion' meaning . little animals' and means literally a circle of animals'. In Herodotus I. 70 it is used in the sense of " figuro painted or carved'. It was then applied to one of the figures imagined as formed by certain star-groups in the belt of the heavens. The Zodiac is a belt in the sky about 16 degrees broad, divided in two by the ecliptic, in which the Sun, Moon and planets move. The expression signs of the Zodiac' may be used in two senses,881 viz. (1) the 12 groups of constellations which 

881. Vide Meissner in 'Babylonian and Assyrian' vol. II. p. 406, Webb in Journal of Hellenistic studies, vol. 41 p, 72, Sarton in 'a History of Science' p. 179 gote 2. Webb in Names of stars' p. 160 points out that Crab and Scales are only 19 and 17} degrees in extent respectively, while Virgo and Fishes are respectively 48 and 41 degrees in extent in the sky. 

Senses of 'signs of zodiac' 

595 

are found sown in the vicinity of the ecliptic (the path of the Sun ) irregular in position, unequal in extent and in brightness; (2) the twelve equal artificial divisions of the belt each extending to 30 degrees of longitude It is generally held that the first meaning alone can be the earlier of the 882 two. Meissner points out that the most ancient Babylonian observation text belonging to the 37th year of Nebuchadnezzar ( 567 B. C.) knows only the figures or pictures of the constellations, while the twelve equal divisions occur first of all in a text of the reign of Darius II (about 418 B. C.). Nothing definite is known about the first formation of these picture-signs nor is it known who gave these fanciful names to stars. There is hardly any doubt that the picture names were due to popular fancy and not to men of science. The names were probably given at different times, Meissner states that the picture signs are already mentioned in part in a Hittite text of the 13th century B. C. and are also to be found on boundary stones of the same period. 

Schiaparelli in Astronomy in the old Testament' (p. 85 ) observes that in Babylonia upright stones were placed in fields as boundary marks ( Kudurru in Babylonian ) or rather as titles of property by way of public notice, of which thirty have been so far discovered on which figures are drawn and on which inscriptions are found containing most terrible curses on those who would remove the stones. On p. 86 he gives the drawing on a Babylonian monument of the 12th century B. C. in which the Moon, the Sun and Venus occupy the contral position and round about them there is a crowd of figures, of which one can easily recognize the scorpion, the goat with a fish's tail (Capricornus) and the Archer. 883 Hooke remarks that several constellations are 

882. Vide Webb in Jouroal of Hellenistic Studies vol. 48 (1925) p. 59; and Journal of Near East Studies vol. 8 pp. 6–26 by Waerden on Baby lodian Astronomy (at p. 25) in which he refers to an observation text from 6th year of Darius II (420 B, C.) containing such statements as Jupiter and Venus being at the begioning of Gemini and the like and emphasizes that Babylonian sigas were of equal length. 

883. The same figure occurs in Rawlinson's 'Five great mogarchies of the ancient world , (ed. of 1889 ) vol. II. p. 574 and that author thioks that there are the Ram, the Bull, the Scorpion, the Serpent, the Dog, the Arrow, the eagle or vulture. Vide George Smith's 'Assyrian Discoveries' (London, 1875) pp. 235-241 where he gives a figure on a boandary stone of about 1370 B. C. which records the grant of land to one Merodach Baladao and a complete English translation of the ioscription. Smith thinks (p. 237)

IIistory of Dharmaśistru (Sec. II, Ch. XVI 

assigned to Ea in the astrological texts, the two most frequently inentioned being Pisces and Aquarius and that Ea's symbol as represented on boundary stones was either Rani's head or goat-884 fish. It is stated by Frankfort 885 that of Zodiacal signs in their Babylonian forms only two, Cancer and Sagittarius, do not occur on the seals of the first dynasty of Babylonia. 

It is possible to argue that in two verses of the Rgveda (I. 24.8 and I. 164.11 ) there is a reference to the Zodiacal belt. * King Varuņa made a wide path in order that the Sun may follow it';' the wheel of sta has twelve spokes and it again and again revolves round the sky, but it is not worn out '.886 

The above references to Babylonian boundary stones and monuments are enough to show that in Babylonia some four or five signs of the Zodiac had been distinguished before 1000 B. C. But the complete list of picture sings of the Zodiac was known in Babylonia at least from about 6th century B. C. as Meissner (referred to above ) says. 887 Sarton cautiously suggests the probability of Babylonian influence on other Oriental peoples (Iranian, Indian and Chinese) but he gives up the discussion of this question as a debatable 888 one. Authorities are agreed that the oldest horoscopes are found in Mesopotamia and not in Greece nor in Egypt. Sarton states that the first known horo scope is a cuneiform tablet in the Bodleian referring to the date 29th April 410 B. C., and that the second is another tablet in the

Cramer in ' Astrology in Roman Law and Politics' (Philadelphia, 1954) agrees with this and gives references to horoscopes of 258 B. C., 231 B. C. and 142 B. C. (pp. 5-8). Prof. Neugebauor on the other hand remarks 889 that only seven horoscopes are found preserved from Mesopotamia, all written in Seleucid period, the earliest being of 263 B. C. C. V. Maclean refers to a horoscope of 28th February 142 B. C. Sarton says that the very word 'horoscopos' was coined very late in Greece, that it is used by Manilius (first century A. D.) and Clement of Alexandria (150–220 A. D.) and that its use cannot be found earlier.890 The earliest Greek horoscope from Egypt concerns the year 4 B. C. and Prof. Neugebauer says that he knows about 60 horoscopes from 4 B. C. to 500 A. D. The earliest Demotic and Greek horoscopes were written about the beginning of the Christian era and the earliest Demotic horo scope refers to 13 A. D. 891 Prof. Neugebauer holds that the rising timos of zodiacal signs mentioned in Bșhajjātaka (I. 19) aro precisely the same as the rising times of zodiacal signs in the Babylonian system (called A.). Vide Journal of Cuneiform Studies, vol. 7 No.. 3 pp. 100-102. 

It has been seen above that not only was general astrology developed in early Vedic times, but individual astrology based on naksatras had begun to be studied even as early as the Atharvaveda, 892, that beginnings of a regular terminology resembling the later bhūra nomenclature had been made and prognostications had been based on the naksatra of birth and on the naksatras at certain distances from the naksatra of birth. Here we have the germs of the basic assumptions of early and

medieval astrology, viz. that a person's future is determined at the time of his birth and that his destiny can be inferred from his horoscope. It will be shown immediately that India was in contact with Mesopotamia and the countries of the Near East from very ancient times. This contact became very close after Alexander's invasion of India about 325 B. C. and in the 3rd century BC. It appears to me probable that Indians who had already the naksatra astrology saw the signs of the Zodiac on Babylonian monuments and boundary stones and adapted them to their own astrological purposes just about the time when the Greeks derived their inspiration for individual astrology from Babylonians. 

In 'Gayā and Buddha Gaya' (Calcutta, 1934 ) Dr. B. M. Barua draws attention (pp. 90-92 and 121 of vol. II) to the fact that one can detect on the railing pillars at Buddha Gaya some of the motifs representing the rāśis or signs of the Zodiac (vide figures 43 a to j, which resemble the signs from Vrsa to Tulā, Dhanus and Makara). These figures were drawn in the 1st century B. C. and would go at least some way towards negativing the view of Weber and others that the rāśi system was borrowed by Indians from such Greek writers as Firmicus and Paulus in the 4th century A.D. These Buddha Gayā figures closely resemble the figures drawn on monuments and boundary stones in Babylonia (vide figures opposite ). All the railing pillars are not preserved. 

A few words may be said about the intercourse between Babylon and India. A. H. Sayce says 893 that as far back as the 3rd millennium B. C. there was cultural and possibly racial continuity between Babylon and the Punjab and the intercourse was by land and that so far there is no evidence that it was by Sea. Peacocks, rice and Indian sandalwood were known in Palestine under their Tamil names in the Hebrew chronicles of Genesis and Kings. 894 The Bogozkeui Inscription of about 1400 B. C. recording treaties between the king of Hittites and the king of Mitanni shows the dynasts of the latter people had the

The Bāveru-jātaka refers to the trade by sea between Babylon and India. 897 Greek ambas sadors such as Megsthenes from Seleucus to Candragupta Maurya, Deimachus to Bindusāra ( son of Candragupta ) had been sent to India and it is not too much to hold that there was reciprocity from the Indian side and Indians bad gone as envoys to the Seleucid and Ptolemaic courts many years before Asoka sent his missionaries. 898 Aśoka's edict No. 13 refers to five kings of the Near East to whom Buddhist missionaries had been sent, viz, to

Antiyoga (Antiochus of Syria), Turamaya (Ptolemy II of Egypt), Antikina ( Antigonus of Macedonia), Magā ( Magas of Cyrene) and Alikasundara 899 (of Epirus). The Gospel of Matthew (chap 2.1-2 ) states that at the birth of Christ in Bethlehem wise men from the east came to Jerusalem saying that they had seen in the east the star of the newly born child and had come to worship hini. The life of Apollonius of Tyana written by Philostratus % ( in the first quarter of the 3rd century A. D.) states that it was usual in India to show great hospitality to Babylonians and that the Indian king, Iarchus, presented to Apollonius seven rings named after the seven planets, of which he was to wear one on each week day. 

The theory that is sought to be propounded here is that the sight of the signs of the Zodiac on such patent objects as monuments and boundary stones in the 4th and 3rd centuries B.C. excited the curiosity of Indians visiting Babylonia, that on knowing their significance they brought the knowledge back to their country and fitted it on to the naksatra astrology that already existed in India and developed the rāśi astrology in their own way. Varaha mihira expressly says about dreskānas that he describes them in accordance with the views of Yavanas. If the whole Indian astrology had been derived from the Yavanas there was nothing to prevent him from saying so. The verge ‘Mleccha hi yavanās &c.'(in note 743 above) implies that the Yavana astrological tradition and Indian one were not the same and that the Yavanas had composed Sanskrit works on astrology (as the author's two papers show). Varāha expressly differs from the Yavanas on

I p. 323, Some scholars bold that the life is a fabrication and that Apollonius never came to India. Supposing for argument that it is a fabrication, the fact remains that in the first quarter of the 3rd century A. D. Pbilostratus knew that Babylonians were respected in India, that seven planets were known in India and that planets were supposed to be propitiated by the wearing of rings on appropriate week days. Charpentier wrote a booklet 

Indian travels of Apollonius of Tyaga' (Leipzig, 1934 ) in which be stated that he felt convinced that Apollonius had been in India but did not go further than the altarg of Alexander (vide · Indian Culture' vol. III. p. 2*1 for a review of Charpentier's booklet).

several substantial points. 901 About 200 B.C. the vernal equinox was at the beginning of the divisional sign Aries, which very closely coincided with the picture sign Aries. The Indian astronomers, when they began to make use of the signs Mesa and others, switched over from the reckoning with the Krttikās as the beginning of the series of naksatras on to the reckoning from the naksatra Asvinī, and counted Aśvini as the first naksatra, though the vernal equinoctial point has now receded owing to precession to the Uttarābhādrapadā naksatra group. It is difficult to trace and describe the early efforts of Indian astro logers in the centuries preceding the Christian era on the system of rāśis, since the excellent work of Varāha, the Bșhajjātaka, eclipsed all its predecessors and led to their gradual disappearance just as the two works of Ptolemy, Syntaxis (or Almagest) and Tetrabiblos, led to the gradual loss and disappearance of Greek works on astronomy and astrology composed before Ptolemy. Though all scholars maintain that Greek horoscopic astrology was influenced by Babylonian astronomy and astrology, the connecting links have snapped and become obliterated. 902 It is likely that, as both India and Greece were influenced by the Babylonian system of signs and astrology, both show somo common characteristics. But it is too wide of the mark to assert that Indian astrology as developed in Varāhamihira was borrowed from Firmicus and Paulus Alexandrinus. Prof. Neugebauer, while asserting that the Sūrya-siddhanta is based on Greek eccentric and epicyclic devices, holds that they were modified by 

901. To mention only a few striking matters of differences of opinion between Varā ba and Yavadas; (1) Yavanas favoured the view that all planets could be lords of horā (balf of a rāśi), while Br. J. said no to this (I. 11-12); (2) Yavanas held that the moon was never a malefic planet, Br. J. (11. 5) said it was so in certain cases; (3) Yavanas regarded Mars as sāttvika, while Br. J.(11. 7) held Mars to be tāmasika; (4) Yavanas held that planets could only be friends or enemies among themselves, while Br. J. (II. 15) held that they could also be neither friends nor foes ; (5) Yavanas and Varāba differed on the temporary friendship or enmity of planets (Br. J. II. 18); (6) Yavanas spoke of Vajrayoga, but Bṛ. J. (XII.3 and 6) beld that such a yoga was impossible; (7) Yavanas held that only the Kumbba dvadasamsa was inauspicious, the Br. J. (XXI. 3 ) found fault with this. 

902. Vide Prof, Neugebauer in E. S, A., p. 93. Prof. Waerden (in Journal of Near Eastern Studies, vol. 8 p. 76 ) remarks that Hellenistic Astrology is a mixture of Chaldean, Egyptiap and Greek elements and that there are more Babylonian elements in this mixture thaa is generati sopposed.

the Indians and that what he means is not that there was copying, but an intelligent modification of the initial impetus ( vide Archives Internationales D' Histoire des Sciences' for April-June 1955 ( at p. 171 and note 32). It has been shown above in note 869 that the Br. J. differs from Firmicus as to dreskānas and about bhāvas ( places in the horoscope ). My hypothesis is that Indian astrology about rāśis and bhāvas was developed before even Ptolemy. I have pointed out the differences between Ptolemy and Varāha in many places. 903 

Horoscopes are cast not only for individuals, but also for companies, ships, animals, 903a foundations of buildings, cities and countries. If a person comes to an astrologer for consulta tion on any matter, the astrologer notes the sign rising at the time the question is asked, calculates the positions of the planets also for that day and time and then makes his prognostications. 204 For casting the horoscope of an individual one must know the year, month, day, hour or ghatikū of birth and the place of birth. Almanacs are prepared on the basis of the latitudes and longitudes of cities like Bombay or Poona or Calcutta and they furnish tables by following which one can find the sign rising at the time of the birth of a person. But the almanacs being based on the latitudes and longitudes of certain towns and cities, if a person uses an almanac prepared in Poona for casting the horoscope of a person born in Berar or Central India there is likely to be some inaccuracy in arriving at the proper lagna.

903 a, Aldous Huxley in his novel Crome yellow' (Phoenix Library, 1929 ) satirizes society ladies who spent their days in casting the horoscopes of horses on which they laid heavy bets (p. 13). 

904. There are two well-knowo works dealing with astrology connec ted with the time of questions, viz. Sat-pañcāśikā of Pșthuyasas, son of Varāhamihira, and the Iryāsaptati of Utpala (printed by Niro. Press, Bombay). Two verses (5 and 35 ) from the first book may be quoted here: होरास्थितः पूर्णतनुः शशाङ्को जीवेन दृष्टो यदि वा सितेन। शिमं प्रणष्टस्य करोति लब्धि लाभो. Tamara 9481 T I TAHEST FUNNIESTELI HIRSEHI: nyerto 

pri uoffraigh an in verse 35 means the lagoa at the time the quese tion is asked. Verse 55 of the same is sistema zen aritu FTATI: YT: I राशिम्यः कालदिग्देशा वयो जातिश्च लग्नपात॥ ' material stolen is inferred from the pavāmsa of the lagoa at tbe time of the question, the characteristics of the thieves from dreskānas of the lagoa ( as described io Br. ). cbap. 27), from the rāsis time, direction and location are learnt and the age and caste of the thief from the lord of the lagaa'. 

Figures of horoscopes 

603 

Horoscopes are framed either in square figures or in circular figures and even as to square horoscopes, there is some variance in the practice of placing the lagna (the sign rising on the horizon at the time of birth ). Supposing the lagna is Simha, the square horoscope as usually drawn in Mahārāstra would be as follows where the figures 6, 2 and 4 would represent the 2nd, 10th and 12th bhūvus (places ), while a horoscope cast on the modern European method would be like the one next to it with the same lagna and employs symbols for the signs as for Aries and for planets such as for Mars.

CHAPTER XVII 

MUHŪRTAS FOR RELIGIOUS RITES 

We shall now turn to the muhūrtas for religious rites and actions of individuals. Only a few of the rites and actions can be briefly dealt with here. 

A few general rules may however be first stated. The Ātharyapa 905 Jyotişa says that a wise man should perform an act or rite with the concurrence of all the four, viz. tithi, nakşatra, karaña and muhurta, if he wants success in it: if a proper tithi cannot be secured then the other three should be availed of, if the first two are not available then the next two, if the first three are not available then secure muhūrta alone; but if there be necessity to hurry and none of the four can be secured, then with the loud declaration by (learned ) brāhmaṇas that it is an auspicious day he should do the act and success is secured. Certain religious acts have to be done at stated times and in those cases, one should not consider the conditions of Jupiter and Venus called bālya and old age or the fact of Jupiter being in Lion sign, or of dakşiņāyana or there being an inter calary month, as for example, in the rites from pursavana up to annaprūšana. The Rājamārtaņda %06 states the correct astrological position of planets and days is not meant for times of distress, all these ( rules about auspicious positions) are to be considered when life is easy (matters are in good condition); so says Bhrgu'. Monday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday confer success in all actions ( begun on those days ); only those actions succeed on Sunday, Tuesday and Saturday, for which those days are expressly laid down as proper. But the Nārada purāņa says that Wednesday, Thursday and Friday are the best, Sunday and Monday are middling and the other two, Viz. Tuesday and Saturday, are condemned for Upanayana. 907

605 

The general rule is that all undertakings succeed when they are begun while the 3rd, 6th, 10th and 11th places from the lagna are either in conjunction with or have an aspect with an auspicious planet and the lagna is also in conjunction with the two, when the 8th and 12th places are faultless and the Moon is in the 3rd, 6th, 10th or 11th place, 908 

It should be remembered that the usual tendency of our medieval Dharmaśāstra writers is generally to heap details on what were originally simple ceremonies. 

Among the samskāras it is best to begin with Jātakarma (rites at the birth of a child). The Ratnamālā 909 provides that the rites on the birth of a son should be performed on a mrdu, dhruta, kşi pra or a cara naksatra and the good recommend the giving of a name when Jupiter or Venus is in całustaya ( i. e. in the 1st, 4th, 7th or 10th bhāva in the infant's horoscope ). As regards birth some writers (e. g. M. M. IV. 19) speak of Gandānta which is inauspicious in birth, marriage and starting on a journey or invasion, viz. the conjunction of 15th tithi with pratipad for two ghatikās, similarly half a ghatikā when Cancer and Lion or Scorpion and Archer or Fish and Ram join and the four ghatikās of the junction of Revati and Aśvini, Āślosā and Maghā, Jyesthā and Mūla. These Gandānta conjunctions produce evil for the child's father or mother &c. Similar results are predicted for birth on certain parts of Āślesa and Mūla. About naming a child Manu provides that it should be performed on the 10th or 12th day from birth or on an auspicious tithi or on a muhurta or nakşatra possessed of auspicious characteris tics. 910 About caula or cūdākarma (tonsure) Āśvalāyana-gļhya (I. 17. 1) provides a simple rule that it should be performed in the third year after birth or according to family usage, while Manu (II. 35 ) provides that it may be perforined in the first or third year; the Āśv. gr., however, has provided for caula, upanayana, godāna and marriage the proper time of the northward passage of the sun, the fortnight of the waxing moon and an auspicious naksatra. The Āp. gr. (16.3 ) states that it may be performed

TA 

in the 3rd year after birth on Punarvasu naksatra. But medieval writers have added numerous astrological details. For example, the Rājamārtanda devotes thirty-two verses to crula ( folios 16 to 18 ), one remarkable provision being that the Yavanas regarded cūdūkırma in the Sun's northward passage as auspicious. 911 Vyāsa quoted by Sm. C. says 'tonsure should be performed on AŚvini, Sravana, Svāti, Citrā, Pusya, Punaryasu, Dhanisthā, Revati, Jyesthā, Mrgasirsa and Hasta and should not be per formed on the person's naksatra of birth, nor on Puryābhādrapadā, Uttarābhādrapadā and Krttikā; one should avoid for tonsure the first tithi ( after amāyāsyā), riktā tithi ( 4th, 9th and 14th), 

Vişti, Sunday, Tuesday, Saturday and night. 912 

Similar rules are laid down for ordinary shaving in the case of grown-up men. 9224 Some verses may be quoted here: the following naksatras are beneficial in the matter of shaving, viz. the naksatras, Hasta, 913 Citrā, Svāti, Mrgasiras, Sravana, Dhanistha Satabhisak, Revati, Aśvini, Jyosthā, Pusya and Punarvasu or when any nakşatra is at the time of its rise in conjunction with the moon provided there is also tārūbala ( as defined below). Shaving is commended when the rising sign is Makara, Dhanus, Kanyā, Mithuna or Vrsa; observing this produces prosperity, strength and growth of intelligence; if shaving is done when any of the other signs is rising, that leads to disease and danger. Shaving is allowed on all nakşatras at the king's command, with a brāhmana's consent, at the time of marriage, on the advent of inpurity due to death, on the release of an imprisoned person and in dikşū (consecration rites ) on a solemn Vedic sacrifice! 

We now turn to Upanayana, one of the two most important sainskāras. Āśvalayana-gļhya (I. 4. 1) as noted above (p. 605)

Dh. 914 S. laid down two further rules providing that the upana. yana of a brāhmaṇa, ksatriya or vaiśya boy should be performed respectively in spring, summer and autumn and the proper ages for these three are respectively the 8th, 11th and 12th from conception. The same ages are prescribed by Manu II, 36 and Yāj. I. 14. It may be noted that none of the sūtras nor the emṛtis of Manu and Yājñavalkya say a word about the position of planets or rāśis or weak-days or month. Gradually such rules were heaped up. The Rājamārtanda devotes 70 verses (froin 304 to 373 on folios 20a to 24a ) to upanayana. It states that the years were to be counted from conception or birth. To find proper muhūrtas for upanayana has become a very intricate matter and such muhūrtas are few and far between. Only a few such rules can be indicated here. First as to months. One text lays down. Upanayana is commended ( for all ) when performed in the five months from Māgha (i. e. from Magha to Jyestha ); while Vrddha-Gārgya quoted in Kalādarśa provides that it may be performed in the six months from Māgha. 915 Another rule provided that no auspicious rites (like upanayana and marriage) should be performed on the nakşatra, month and week-day on which the person concerned was born and no auspicious rite for the eldest son or eldest daughter should be performed in the month of Jyestha.'916 The sages differed about the month of birth. Vasistha said that only the day of birth was to be avoided, Garga says only eight days of the month of birth were to be

avoided, Atri says ten days and Bhāguri says the fortnight of birth in the month was to be avoided. 917 No upanayana was to be performed when the moon was lost in the rays of the sun, when Venus had set, when the sun was in the first ainsa (degree) of a rāśi and on days which were declared to be unfit for vedic study and on gala-praha. 918 Certain tithis and times were called galagraha ( as stated in the note ). 919 If Jupiter be in the 2nd, 5th, 7th, 9th or 11th rasi from the risi of birth, then Jupiter is very auspicious; if Jupiter be in the 1st, 3rd, 6th or 10th rasi from the rāśi of birth he becomes auspicious after a śānti rite; if Jupiter be in the 4th, 8th or 12th rasi from birth he is inauspicious. 920 

One rather convenient doctrine of the astrologers was that an evil planet may be mollified and the evil consequences of its influence avoided, or, if not altogether avoided, substantially reduced or abated by appropriate rites (called śāntis) or by wearing certain precious stones and metals and by various other means enumerated in the Ratnamālā 921 'one should wear coral for appeasing Mars and the Sun, silver for Venus and the Moon, gold for Mercury, pearl for Jupiter, iron for Saturn and rājāvarta ( a kind of inferior gem ) for the other two (Rāhu and Ketu). The Ratnamālā provides that planets may not possibly afflict a man if he engages in prostrations before images of gods and before brāhmanas, if he carries out the advice of elders, by holding daily conversations with the good, by listening to the

loud recitation of the Vedas and to the stories about the great, by offering homa, by seeing the performance of Vedic sacrifices, by making the mind pure, by japa ( inaudible repetition of mantras ), by making gifts. The Bșhatsamhitā has a similar verse. Ratnamālā X. 16 and Muhūrtacintāmaņi IV. 9 provide that one should possess a golden ring divided into nine compart ments, one being in the middle in which there is to be a ruby for placating the Sun, and in eight directions from the east onwards should be set in order: a diamond for placating Venus in the east, a fine pearl for the moon (in S. E.), coral for Mars (South). gomeda for Rāhu (in S. W.), fine sapphire for Saturn (West), Vaidūrya (cat's eye gem) for Ketu (N. W.), pusyaraga ( topaz) for Jupiter (North ), emerald for Mercury (N. E.). Such ringa are worn oven in these days by some people. 

As in ancient times upanayana was meant for conferring on the boy the authority to study Veda and as the planet Jupiter (Guru ) was identified with Brhaspati, the guru of the gods and the Lord of Speech, great importance was attached to the position of Jupiter. But exceptions were introduced even when Jupiter was apparently not favourable. One exception was 'even if Jupiter be in the 8th place from the rāśi of birth or be in the sign of Lion ( which is the svagha of the Sun) or in depression (i. e. in Makara ) or in the house of his enemy, upanayana would be auspicious if performed in Caitra when the Sun is in Pisces ( which is the svagrha of Jupiter). This exception is due to the fact that the principal time for upanayana is the 8th year from conception or birth and other conditions are of secondary importance, as the Dharmasindhu says. 922 Certain naksatras alono were declared to be auspicious for upanayana and samā virtana of dvijas viz. on the naksatras Hasta, Citrā, Svāti, Puşya, Dhanisthā, Revati, Aśvini, Mrgasiras, Punaryasu and Sravana; upanayana was to be performed on a commended tithi when the Moon is powerful ( i. e. from 5th of bright half to the 5th of the dark half ). 923 

Very intricate astrological rules are provided for marriage. The Aśv. gr. S. (I. 4. 1-2) laid down a very simple rule about

the proper times for four samskāras which has been quoted above (p. 536 note 778). The Baud. gr. (1. 1. 18-20) provides that marriage may be celebrated in all months, that according to some, the months of Asādha, Māgha and Phālguna are to be avoided and that the auspicious naksatras for marriage are Rohini, Mrgasirsa, Uttarā-Phalguni and Svāti (vide notes 726 and 777 above). The Āp. gr. (I. 2. 12–13) is to the same effect as to months ( vide note 775). The Kausikasūtra 924 (75. 2-4) approaches medieval and modern practice as it prescribes that marriage should be celebrated after the Full Moon of Kārtika up to the Full moon of Vaišākha or one may do as one likes but one should avoid the month or half month of Caitra. In medieval and modern times there was some difference of opinion. The Rājamārtanda ( that devotes over 150 verses to the treatment of marriage) allowed all months for marriage except Caitra and Pausa. 925 But works like the Dharmasindhu say that the months of Māgha, Phālguna, Vaišākha and Jyestha are auspicious, Mārgaśirşa is middling and in some works Āsādha and Kārtika are allowed and that usages of the country should be followed. 

Then consideration is to be given to the nakşatras, the week days, the positions of the planets, particularly Jupiter, Venus, Sun and Moon. But before doing so I would like to draw the attention of modern sticklers for astrological requirements about the marriage of a girl to the practical advice and wise words of the Rājamārtanda and Bhujabala composed in the first half of the 11th century A. D. The Rājamārtanda 926 says 'when

(an invading ) king has seized a country or when war is raging or when the life of the parents is in danger, a maiden who is very much grown up is not to wait for an ( auspicious ) time; when a maiden is very much grown up, but does not act against the rules of dharma she should be given in marriage, even though she is impure, without minding whether the Moon and the lagna are powerful'. The Bhujabala 927 (or Bhujabalabhima) provides 'the sages declare that in the case of maidens the auspiciousness of planets and of the year, the month, ayana, season and days is to be considered only before maidens reach the age of ten 

years'. 

There is some difference of opinion about the auspicious nakşatras for marriage, but all are agreed as to Robiņi, Mrgaśiras, Maghi, Uttara-Phalguni, Uttarāṣādhā, Uttara bhadranada, Hasta, Svāti, Mala, Anuradha, Revatl (vide Bṛ. 8. 100. 1). Others like Haradatta add four more viz. Aśpini, Citrā, Sravana, Dhanisthā. But if any one of these is in conjunction with a malefic planet, it should be avoided. Among weekdays, Monday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday are auspicious, the other three are middling. According to & verse quoted in Jyotistattva weekdays have no force at night and particularly Tuesday, Saturday and Sunday. 928 Among tithis amāvāsyā is forbidden; riktā tithis ( 4th, 9th, 14th ) yield little good; the other tithis yield much good; the bright half of a month is the best and the dark half of a month upto 13th tithi is middling.

beneficent. If Jupiter is in exaltation 930 or in its own house or in the house of a friendly planet then he confers full life, various kinds of wealth and happiness, but if Jupiter is in the first or 8th or is depressed or in the house of an enemical planet or lost in the brilliance of the Sun he produces widowhood and distress to the issue. As regards the lagna at the time of marriage the Sun in the 3rd, 6th, 8th from it, the Moon in the 2nd, 3rd or 4th place from it, Mars in the 3rd and 6th, Mercury and Jupiter in the 8th and 12th are to be avoided. If Venus is in the lagna or in the 2nd, 4th, 5th, 9th or 10th place from it, Saturn, Rāhu and Ketu in 3rd, 6th and 8th from it and every planet in the 11th place from lagna conduces to happiness in marriage. If at the time of marriage Jupiter 931 is 2nd, 5th, 7th, 9th, 11th from the rāśi of birth he is auspicious to the maiden; if in 1st, 3rd, 6th or 10th place therefrom, he becomes beneficent by performing a śānti rite; if he is 4th, 8th or 12th he is inauspi cious: but if Jupiter is at the time of marriage ) in Karka, Dhanus or Mina, he ceases to be inauspicious even though he may be in the 4th, 8th or 12th place ( from rāśi of birth ); in a time of pressing difficulty Jupiter though in the 4th or 12th becomes auspicious after performing two śāntis ( Bṛhaspati homas ) and though in the 8th after three śāntis. In the case of the bridegroom the Sun in the 3rd, 6th, 10th or 11th rāśi from the bridegroom's rāśi at birth is auspicious; if in other rāśis the Sun becomes auspicious after the performance of a homa. 

If a maiden 932 has attained the age of puberty then one should not stop to consider whether Jupiter is auspicious; oven if Jupiter be 8th from the girl's rāśi of birth marriage should be brought about after three śāntis. 

If Jupiter be in the house of the Sun (i. e. in Simha sign) and the Sun is in the house of Jupiter (i, e in Mina or Dhanus ) that is called Guryāditya, which is condemned for all rites.

Gorajas muhūrta for marriage 

613 

A good deal is said in the medieval works on Simhastha Guru and the rules laid down on this topic are even now observed by most people. The Rājamārtanda devotes six verses to it. When Jupiter is in the sign Lion several rites would become inauspici. ous such as marching on an invasion, marriage, upanayana, first entrance in a newly built house, the establishment of the image of a god. Certain modifications were introduced by sages. Parāśara provided that no marriage should be performed in the countries between the Ganges and the Godāvarī, when Jupiter was in Lion sign and that when Jupiter was in Maghā naksatra (the first of the 24 naksatras of Simha) and when the Sun was in Mina no 

marriage in all the countries (of India) should take place; Vasiştha said 'marriage and Upanayana are not bad in simhastha Guru when performed in a country north of the Ganges and to the south of the Godavari.933 

On account of the complicated nature of the muhurta for marriage, a short cut was hit upon called Godhuli or Gorajas (literally, dust raised by cows) muhurta. The Rajamartanda devotes ten verses to it (folios 34b and 35a, verses 550-559 ). Three of them are set out here. 934. While the Sun, though setting, appears like saffron or red sandalwood paste, while the stars in the sky are not seen to sparkle with their light, while the sky is filled with the dust pounded by cows ( returning to their pens) with the tips of their hoofs, that time is declared to be Godhūlikā, which gives rise to wealth and crops and prosperity. In this muhūrta the planets, the tithis, Visti or stars or constel lations do not create an obstacle; this unimpeded yoga was

declared by Bhārgava as time for marriage and for starting on an invasion. When no other auspicious lagna can be found then sages direct that Godhūlikā (muhūrta ) is auspicious; but if & lagna which is auspicious and powerful can be found the Godhūlikā muhūrta does not bring about auspicious results. The Dharmasindhu (p. 254 ) simply quotes the Muhūrta-mārtanda IV. 38, which says that this muhurta is intended for sūdras, but that in times of great difficulty when the girl has reached puberty it may be auspicious also for brāhmaṇas and persons of other varpas. In these days also this Gorajas muhurta is sometimes resorted to by all varṇas. 

There are other complicated astrological matters for con sideration in marriage such as Daśayogacakra (R. M. folios 35b-36b), Saptasalākācakra (R. M. folio 365–37b), which are passed over here. But there in one matter that is sometimes gone into even now and that must be briefly alluded to, viz. the calculation of the guņas (marks) on the comparison of eight matters concerning the nakşatra and rāśi on which the intending bride and bridegroom were born. This is designated 'vadhū varamelakavicāra' or 'ghatitagunayicāra'. The eight matters (kūțas as they are called) are varņa, vaśya, tārā, yoni, grahamaitrī, ganamaitri, rāśikūta and nādi,935 varpa carrying one mark, each succeeding one having one more mark (in all 36 ) than the one immediately preceding. All of them are not described even in the latest works; for example, the Dharmasindhu deals only with the last four. Two of these, viz. gana and nādi are attached great importance even now among brāhmaṇas and other classes also. I have described these two in K. of Dh. vol. II. p. 515. All these night are described at length in Muhūrtamārtanda (IV. 1-12) and Muhūrta-cintāmaņi( VI. 21-35), Samskaraprakāśa (part of Vīramitrodaya) pp. 773ff. and Samskāra-ratna-mālā pp. 519ff. One 986 rule made matters easy in some cases, viz. when the rāśi of birth of both bride and bridegroom was the same, but the nakşatras of their birth wore different or where the nakşatra was the same but the rāśis were

different, then no consideration need be paid to gana and nādi and the like and if the naksatra of both is one and the same it would be auspicious if they were born on different quarters of the same naksatra. Now that in most educated families the age of the bride and bridegroom is twenty years and beyond and there are also love marriages the rigours of this examination of astrological details have been very much reduced, but they are not completely gone even now. In the author's youth nearly sixty years ago, even if the girl was quite eligible from all other points of view, a marriage among the well-to-do classes was almost impossible if this tallying of marks was not astrologically favourable. 

Great importance was attached to the favourable position of Jupiter in the case of marriages. The Ratnamālā 937 states 

Mercury that could be seen ( being a good deal away from the Sun) and occupying the 1st, 4th or 10th place in the horoscope removes one hundred astrological defects; Venus removes double of such defects and the teacher of the gods (Jupiter ) when powerful certainly renders nugatory even one hundred thousand defects'. 

In marriages both candrabala and tārābala were required. As stated in note 772 above the 3rd, 5th and 7th naksatras from the naksatra of birth were called respectively.vipad (calamity ), 'pratyari'( facing enemy ) and' vadha' ( destruction ) and they yielded results in consonance with their names; therefore they were to be avoided in auspicious rites and:particularly in marriage. The nakşatras from that of birth were arranged in three groups of nine. In the 2nd group the evil ones would be 12th, 14th and 16th and in the 3rd group 21st, 23rd and 25th. It was laid down that, where the Moon 98 is powerful, the tārābala need not be considered, but where the Moon is weak ( as in the dark half ), then the strength of tārās is pre-eminent. Some authors regarded even the nakşatra of birth as one to be avoided in certain rites, though acceptable in others.

History of Dharmaśāstra 

(Sec. II, Ch. XVII 

In relation to marriage the Rājamārtanda 939 says: tithi is declared to have a single value while weekday is four times as good, naksatra is 16 times better, yoga has a hundredfold result, the Sun is a thousandfold efficacious, while the Moon is effica cious one hundred thousand times; therefore leaving aside all other balas (astrological strengths) one should look to the strength of the Moon as (the pre-eminent) strength. 

Now that in most countries including India the kingly office has been abolished, muhurtas for coronation are of purely academic interest and therefore they are not set out here. Those interested may refer to Ratnamālā XIV. 1-8, Muhūrtamārtanda VIII. 1, Muhūrta-cintāmaņi X. 1-4, Rājanītiratnākara pp. 82-84 (ed. by K. P. Jayaswal). 

One very important astrological subject was Yatrā, which has two meanings, viz. starting on a journey for going to tirthas or for earning wealth and marching out for victory by kings. The first kind of yātrā is common to persons of all varpas, while the second is concerned only with ksatriyas or the king. 940 It appears that not only professed works on astrology but also the Smrtis, the Arthasāstra of Kautilya and Purāņas attached great importance to this subject. The Aśramayāsikaparva 941 7. 12-18, Manu VII. 181-213, Matsya 240-243, Agni 233-235, Visnu dharmottara II. 175-176, the Arthasastra in books IX ('the work of one who wants to be an invader') and X ( relating to war) deal exhaustively with the subject of Yana or Yātrā. The subjects of Yātrā are summarised in the Brhat-sanhitā 2,8 follows 92 ; Under Yātrā are included knowledge of proper

Topics falling under Yatrā 

617 

tithis, week days, kuranas, nakşatras, muhurtas, the vilagna (the lagna at the time of starting), the ( different) yogas (con junctions of planets, naksatras, rāśis &c.), the throbbings of the limbs of the body, dreams, baths for victory, sacrifice to the planets, worship of deities in groups (such as Guhyakas), the indications drawn from fire-flames ( at the time of homa ), the indications derived from the gestures of elephants and horses, the talk of men in the army and its activities, the ( nine ) planets, the employment of six gunas ( sanithi, vigraha, yuna, ūsanit, draidhibhāra, ūśruya) according to the strength of planets, auspicious and inauspicious things and sights, the four upiyas (sāma, dāna, danda, bheda), sukunas (omens ), the ground for army encampment, the colour of the flames of fire, the employ. ment as time may require of ministers, spies, onvoys, forest tribes and means of securing the enemy's forts. 

Varāhamihira, besides devoting several chapters of the Brhatsamhita ( such as 43-50, 88-96 ) to matters falling under 'Yātrā' composed three works on it, viz. the Bșhadyogayātrā, the Yogayātrā and Țikkanikā.943 Apart from the verses in the Bṛhatsamhitā, Varāhamihira devotes over 1100 verses to Yātrā. Yātrā is dealt with in several other works also such as the Ratna mālā (XV. 1-74), Rājamārtanda (folios 42a-50a, versos 653-795), the Muhūrtacintāmaņi( XI. 1-109 ). The reason why the work is

Part of the Yogayātrā (chapters 1-9) was published by Kern in the Indische Studien vol. X. pp. 161-212, vol. XIV Pp. 312-358, vol. XV pp. 167-184 (with translation in German), Mr. Jagadish Lal of Lahore published the whole of it in 1944, but he had a defective ms, and there are many gaps in the text as prioted. There is a ms. of the Yogayātrā in the Bbau Daji collection of the Bombay Asiatic Society with the commentary of Utpala. There are 16 chapters of the Yogayātrā with about 467 verses ( 17 chap. in the Lahore ed.) and the Bphadyogayātrā ms. has 34 chapters and about 520 verses i e, the latter is slightly larger than the former, The Tikkanikā is a small work (in dide chapters and about one hundred verses) recently published by Mr. V. R. Pandit (who devotes great industry and acumen in arriving at a tolerable text) in the Journal of the Bombay University, vol. XX part 2 (for 1951 ) pp. 40-63.

called Yogayātrā is as follows: When a war944 is impending, to look out and wait for auspicious tithis, week-days, naksatra would involve a great delay. Therefore, the conjunctions and positions of certain planets in some fixed places (i. e, yoga) is looked upon as the principal astrological matter. The Yoga yātrā and Ratnamālā say:945 Just as even a poison may work like nectar when mixed (with other substances like milk) or just as even honey taken with ghee may act like poison, in the same way a planet giving up its own peculiar power yields results due to certain conjunctions. Kings march out on conjunctions, thieves and bards act on sakunas, brāhmaṇas act on the efficacy of naksatras, others (than these) secure their objects on the strength of muhurtas, 

____ In Brhaj-jataka (28.3) Varaha declares that he will enume. rate the topics concerning Yatra946 and verses 4-5 specify th topics, which agree in the main as to names of titles and their order with those in the Bșhad-yogayātrā chapters II-XX and not with those of the Yogayātrā. All these works cover a very wide field and deal with many subjects that are not strictly astrological (as the quotation from the Brhatsamhitā cited above in note 942 will show). Even the purely astrological matarial runs into hundreds of verses and all that can be attempted here is to indicate very briefly some of the material. 

If a person's rising sign at birth (lagna) is not known, then the lagna at the time of asking a question about Yātrā may be used for astrological purposes. If such a lagna is either Meşa, Karka, Tulā or Makara and is occupied by auspicious

planets or has an auspicious aspect with any of them, then the questioner becomes successful in his undertaking; but if the lagna, whatever it may be, is occupied by Mars and the Moon or if the Moon is aspected by Saturn or is in the 7th or 8th place and the Sun is in lagna or if a malefic planet occupies the lagna or the 4th, 7th or 8th place, then in all these cases the questioner would be defeated or destroyed (by his enemies ).947 The week-days were regarded as not of much importance in Yatrā. The 6th, 8th, 12th tithi, Full Moon tithi, amāvāsyā, riktā tithi (4th, 9th, 14th) and the first of the bright half were not commended for Yātrā (the rest were com mended) and yātrā was commended on nine naksatras, viz. on Aśvini, Punarvasu, Anurādhā, Mrgasiras, Puşya, Revati, Hasta, Sravana and Dhanisthā. The Yogayātrā IV, Raja mārtanda ( verses 695-752 ), Ratnamālā XV verses 1-74, Muhurtacintamani XI. 55-74 furnish numerous conjunctions that would make a king successful. A few are set out here by way of sample. That king that has at the time of marching on an expedition Jupiter in the lagna, Mercury and Venus respec tively in 4th and 5th places, Mars and Saturn in 6th, the Sun in the 3rd and the Moon in the 10th secures the complete fruit of what he desires 948 ; (the king is victorious ) if Jupiter is in the lagna and the other planets are in the 2nd and 11th places; 949 when at the time of marching the king has Venus, Mercury and the Sun respectively in the 1st, 2nd and 3rd places his enemies fall into the fire of battle like moths; 950 when Venus occupies either the 4th, 3rd or 11th house, if he has an aspect with Jupiter that is in a kendra (1st, 4th, 7th or 10th house ) and the malefic planets are in places other than the 7th, 8th or 9th place such a conjunc tion procures for the king heaps of wealth (and victory ). 951 

Certain other astrological matters may be alluded to here. Rainfall in the four months from Pausa is called unseasonable;

one should avoid vrata and yātrā for seven days thereafter; unseasonable rainfall does not create any defects to a king ( starting on an invasion) if the ground is not (so muddy as to he) marked with the soiled footprints of men and beasts. 952 The Muhurtacintamani says953 'one (the king) should not start as long as the periods of upanayana rite, the establishment of an image, marriage, festivals (like holikū) and impurity (on birth or death) have not come to an end and for seven days after unseasonable flashes of lightning, clouds, fall of rain or snow'. 

Going out of the house on the 9th tithi from the tithi of entrance, or entering a house on the 9th tithi after the tithi of leaving it and the 9th tithi itself are prohibited and the same applies to week-day and naksatra also.954 

One should avoid starting in such a way as to face Venus. This belief is very old as the Sāntiparva and Kālidāsa refer to it.955 If the king or any one else has decided on a very auspicious day and conjunction for marching out, but some unforeseen or urgent business prevents him from actually going, he should arrange for what is called prasthāna (starting, but returning after going a very short distance or sending forward something on the auspicious day and starting within a certain number of days thereafter ). A brahmana should56 send out a sacred thread, (a ksatriya) a weapon, vaisya should send honey and a sūdra should send out a pure fruit (like cocoanut) or anyone of whatever varna may send whatever is dear to his heart. The sages differed as to the distance one should proceed

for prasthānt and then return. Gārgya 957 said that he may proceed from his own house to another house ( though very near), Bhrgu holds that one should leave the boundaries of one's village and stay in another village, Bharadvāja provides that one may go as far as an arrow may be discharged and Vasistha says he must go out of the city. The prasthāna should be made in the direction in which one intended to proceed. If the king resorts to prasthāna he cannot stay in one place for ten days (i. e. he may stay nine days ), a foudatory chief not for seven days and any other ordinary person not for five days and if a person stays beyond these limits he can only start again on a fresh good muhūrta. 958 Even in modern times some people resort to this method of prasthūna and generally it is a friendly neighbour's house where the bundle of substances (some rice, betelnut, turmeric &c. ) is kept and taken away when actually starting on a journey. 

The Yogayātrā XIII. 3 provides that a king when starting on an expedition should see, hear and touch mangalas and enumer ates them in verses 4-6, 10-15 at length. A few of them are noted here. Auspicious sounds are those of the recitations of the Veda and the auxiliary lores of the Veda, of conches, drums, of words like 'punyāha' (it is a holy day) and of the Purāņas, Dharmaśāstras, Arthaśāstras, the Mahābhārata and the Rāmā- · yana; the auspicious chirpings of cranes, cāşı, peacocks, swans and jivajivika (partridge ); crows sitting on the backs of tortoises marked with mud; auspicious objects are the bilva tree, chowries, sandalwood, cow with calf, a goat, priyangu croeper, fried grains, a chariot filled with men; banners, sarvauşadhi, slastika sign, vessels filled with presents; horse, undried ginger, cowdung, mustard, mirror, a bull bound with ropes, meat, a jar full of water, turban, lute, umbrella, curds, honey, ghee, yellow pigment, maiden, flagstaff, gold, lotus, conch, white ox, flowers, fine clothes, fish, well-dressed brāhmaṇas, street walkers, and dancing girls, fire in flames, elephants, wet earth, goad, weapons ; various precious stones such as emerald, ruby, crystal; a young woman accompanied by her son; these signs and objects should

be arranged for or they may present themselves spontaneously. The Agnipurāpa chap. 243, Ratnamālā XV. 97-98, Muhūrta mārtanda VII. 15-16, 20 and several others contain similar long lists of auspicious matters on a king's yātrā. Long lists of auspicious and inauspicious sights, persons, animals and substances are furnished by the Br. S. chapters 86-96 (expressly based upon the works of Rşabha, Bhāguri, Devala, Bhāradvāja and authors on yātrā like Garga dealing with sakunas of all kinds, including barking of dogs, chirping of birds and crows ), the Bșhadyogayātrā chapters 21-28 dealing with omens derived from the movements of elephants, horses, the cries of she-jackals, crows &c, the Yogayātrā XIII. 14, Muhārtacintāmaņi XI. 99-100, Muhūrtamārtanda VII. 17-19, Rājanītiprakāśa pp. 335– 360 and other works. As an illustration only one verse from the Yogayātrā is 959 translated here. The following are inauspi. cious ( on Yātrā)- cotton, herbs and drugs, black corn, salt, an impotent person, bones, orpiment, fire, serpent, coals, poison, serpent's slough, excreta, razor, diseased persons, one who has vomited or is mad or paralysed or blind, grass, husk, a famished person, butter milk, an enemy, one whose head is completely shaved, one whose body is anointed with oil, one with hair dishevelled, a sinner, one wearing reddish garments. 

The construction of a house (vāstu ) is a very important matter oven in the grhya.and dharma-sūtras. Construction of a house and the first entrance into it have been described in the H. of Dh. vol. II pp. 833–836 but the astrological requirements were not illustrated there. The Pāraskara-gļhya %0 simply provides that the construction of a house should be begun on an auspicious day. The Hiraṇyakeśigshya is more specific and says that a shed or house should be begun after kindling fire in the northward passage of the Sun, in the fortnight of the waxing moon, on the nakşatras of Rohiņi or the three Uttarās, viz.

Times for construction of a house 

623 

Uttarā Phalguni, Uttarāsādhā and Uttarābhādrapadā. The Matsypurāņa chap. 253, Ratnamālā chap. 17, Rājamārtanda verses 805–884 (folio 51b-55b), Hemādri on Kāla pp. 817-829, Muhurtadarśana IX, Jyotistattva pp. 662-670, Muhũrtacintā mani XII. 1-29, Nirnayasindhu p. 364 deal with the construction of a house. Matsya ( 252, 2-4) names eighteen teachers of Vāstusāstra. A few astrological details are set out here. Matsya ( 253. 1-5 ) states the results of beginning the construction of a house in the twelve months from Caitra respectively as disease, fine cows, death, good servants and plenty of cattle ( in Āsādha ), servants, loss, wife's death, wealth and crops ( in Kartika), rice, danger from thieves, various benefits, gold and son (in Phālguna). The auspicious nakşatras for commencing a house are Asvini, Rohini, Mūla, the three Uttaras, Mļgaśiras, Svāti, Hasta and Anurādhā and all weekdays (except Sunday and Tuesday ) are auspicious (Matsya 253, 6–7). The Rājamārtanda %1 puts many of the astrological requirements in two verses as follows; 'the sages say that the auspicious work of (constructing ) a house should be begun on the auspicious naksatras of Punarvasu, Pusya, Rohini, Mrgasiras, Citra, Dhanistha, Uttarā (three of them ), Revati, Sravana, Satabhisak, Anuradhā, Svāti endowed with auspicious tārās, on Monday, Wednesday, Thursday or Friday, on an auspicious Yoga, on a tithi other than rikta (i. e, 4th, 9th, 14th ) and on a day when there is no Visti; when beneficial planets occupy the kendra (1st, 4th, 7th and 10th places ), the 8th and 12th places, when malefic planets occupy the third, 6th and 11th places, when Jupiter is in the lagna or hendra, or Venus occupies any of these latter and when the rūši of the owner is auspicious, and when any of the sthira naksatras are rising, one should commence a house or make the first entrance into it. The Ratnamālā says that the construction of a house should not be begun on cira rāśis. There are several other complicated calculations and diagrams employed in finding out a proper time for beginning the construction of a house such as āya, vyaya and Rāhumukhacakra that are passed over here.

It is stated in the Rājamārtanda verse 887 ( quoted in note 961 ) that the same astrological conditions are required in the case of the first entrance in a newly built house as in commen cing to build a house. Vide Rājamārtanda (folio 57 Verses 900-908 ), Ratnamālā XVIII, 1-11, Jyotistattva pp. 670–71, Muhurtacintamani XIII, Nirnayasindhu p. 366 for rules about grha-praveśa (first entrance into house ). The Rājamārtanda says that *2 first entrance into a newly built house should be made on the nakşatras Revati, Dhanisthā, Satabhisak, Rohini, the three Uttarās, on an auspicious work-day, when the moon is not weak, on a tithi other than riktā. He should enter the house on the floor of which plenty of flowers are strewn, which has good ornamental arches, which is adorned with jars filled with water, in which the gods have been worshipped with sandalwood paste, flowers and offerings and which rings with the recitation of ( the Vedas by ) brāhmaṇas. 

It may be stated here that some of the astrologicial require ments about the construction of a house and the first entrance 

into a newly built house are observed even now. 

The proper times for the establishment of the images of gods are specified in many works such as Brhatsamhitā 60. 20-21, Matsya-purāņa ( 264 ), Visnudharmottara III. 96, Rājamārtanda (folios 57b-59b, verses 909--943), Hemādri on Kāla pp. 830–847, Jyotistattva pp. 666-667 and 672–73, Nirnayasindhu pp. 334-335, Dharmasindhu p. 318. The Bșhatsamhitā %3 lays down the general rules for the establishment of the images of all gods, * In the northward passage of the sun, in the bright half, when the moon is in the virga of Jupiter, when the lagnu is a sthira rāsi and the navamāmsa rāśi of the lagna is sthira and beneficent planets occupy the kendra places or the 5th and 9th places in the horoscope ( of the establisher), when the malefic planets are in the 3rd, 6th, 10th or 11th places, on nakşatras called dhruva

or mrdu or on Sravana, Pusya or Svāti naksatra, on a favourable week day (other than Tuesday) the establishment of the images of gods is commended'. The Matsya states ( 264. 3-12) that the establishment ( pratisthā) of the images of all gods leads to beneficent results when done in the months of Caitra, Vaišākha, Jyestha, Māgha or Phālguna, in the bright fortnight after dakşiņāyana ends, on the tithis 2nd, 3rd, 5th, 7th, 10th, Full moon, 13th ( this is the best ), on sixteen named naksatras (excepting Bharani, Křttikā, Ardrā, Punarvasu, Aşleşā, Maghā, Pūrvā-phalguni, Citrā, Višākhā, Dhanisthā, Satatārakı ), when the lagna has an aspect with the three beneficent planets Mercury, Jupiter and Venus, on an auspicious yoga, when the lagna or naksatra (of establisher ) is free from malefic planets and on brāhma muhūrta. 

The Ratnamāla %1 provides different nakşatras for the establishment of the images of different gods, one interesting provision being that the image of Buddha was to be established on Sravana naksatra. In the case of the images of the Mātrs, Bhairava, the Varāha, Narasimha and Trivikrama incarnations and of Devi, the killer of Mahişāsura, ostablishment may be made even in Dakşiņāyana. For the establishment of Linga special rules are provided for which Nirnayasindhu (pp. 335 336 ) may be consulted. 

The Rajamārtanda %5 provides that the 2nd, 3rd, 10th, 13th and 15th tithis are always commended for establishment of images of gods and even the 7th and 6th if the establisher likes. 

In the Indian Antiquary vol. VI. p. 363 we find an inscri tion of Cālukya king Mangalisa dated sake 500 (578-79 A. D.) recording the grant of a village named Lañjiśvara on the auspicious occasion of the establishment of an image of god Visņu. 454

History of Dharmaśāstra (Sec. II, Ch, XVII 

Auspicious times were prescribed for wearing new garments for the first time. The Nirnayasindhu quotes two verses %6 'It is desirable to put on now garments for the first time on nakşatras of Asvinī, the three Uttarās, Punarvasu, Puşya, Revati, Dhanisthā. The following are the consequences of wearing new garments for the first time on the week days from Sunday respectively, viz. becoming worn out, constantly wet with water, SOTTOW, wealth, knowledge, meeting with one's dear ones, becoming dirty; the woman who wears new garments or now ornaments for the first time on Rohini, Puşya, Punarvasu, Uttara-Phalguni and takes a bath on Satatārakā naksatra does not stay with her husband ( i. e. she leaves him). If a woman wears for the first time a garment dyed with Kusumbha (safflower) or ornaments of gold, precious stones, coral, glass, conch-shell on Revati, Aśvini, Dhanişthā, Hasta, Citrā, Svāti, Višākhā, Anurādhā, that leads to male progeny, wealth and happiness, but if she puts on these on Rohipī, the three Uttarās, Punarvasu and Puşya, that leads to the unhappiness of the husband. 

Muhūrtas are prescribed for beginning to take medicine in Rājamārtanda ( folio 62a, verses 973 ff), Jyotistattva pp. 678 ff, Nirnayasindhu p. 362. Only one verse is cited %7 here; . If one begins to take medicine on the naksatras Mūla, Anurādhā, Mrgaśiras, Pusya, Punarvasu, Revatī, Aśvini, Śravaņa, Jyesthā, Hasta, Citra, Svāti, and on Monday, Thursday or Friday, that would benefit the patient. Medieval works like the Rājamārtanda, Bhujabala, Muhūrta-mārtanda, Jyotistattva, Nirņayasindhu describe the muhūrtas and inauspicious times for all matters under the sun (not necessarily religious ) such as for purchase and sale of merchandise and animals, for agricultural operations, for planting trees, for digging tanks and wells, for oil bath, for baths with ground myrobalans &c. 

The foregoing discussion about the astrological requirements in several religious and secular matters are enough to show how astrology and omens have had a very firm hold on the minds

of Indians for the last two thousand years or more. With regard to favourable and unfavourable omens Varahamihira himself says “If all favourable and unfavourable signs %were on ono side and on the other side there is purity of heart, it is the latter that brings success' or on one side all omens, on the other the purity of the mind (it is the mind that counts ); in a battle the mind may be suddenly seized with fear and even the wind may be the cause of victory or defeat'. The Matsyapurāna after mentioning unusual occurrences and omens in connection with the march of a king on an invasion winds up as follows: 469 'Auspicious planets are commonded, particularly Jupiter ( as indicative of future success). Belief in god, faith, honouring those that deserve honour-all these are commended and whatever olse may be approved by one's conscience. In this matter (of invasion ) the peace of the mind is the highest indication of (coming ) success, when all omens are on one side and the mind's peace on the other'. A purely astrological work like the Ratna mālā 970 of Sripati says the same thing. 

Owing to the almost universal belief in astrology, there wag always the temptation to fasten fanciful horoscopes on renowned avatāras and heroes. Some Mss. of the Rāmāyaṇao contain a few details of the horoscope of Rāma, the principal ones being that the lagna was Karkața, in which the Moon and Jupiter were in conjunction and that five planets were in exaltation (ucca ). As the Moon was in Cancer, that planet was not in exaltation, since Taurus ( Bull) is exaltation of the Moon. As Rāma was born on Caitra bright half 9th the Sun was in Mesa (Aries, Ram), which is also the ucca of the Sun. Therefore,

Mercury must be either in conjunction with the Sun or in Taurus or Pisces. None of these is the ucca of Mercury. Probably Mercury should be taken to be with Venus as they are friends, while if Mercury be placed in Vrsabha (Taurus or Bull) he would be in the house of an enemy. The Rāmāyaṇa does not mention 

Rāhu and Ketu at all. So the horoscope of Rāma would be as follows : 972

Vide Pillai's 'Indian Ephemeris' vol. I part I pp. 112-123 for discussion on Rāma's horoscope. Kālidāsa in the Raghuvamsa (III. 13 ) states that Raghu, the ancestor of Rāma, was born when five planets were in exaltation and were not setting (i, e. were a good many degrees away from the Sun). But he does not furnish the lagna nor even the month of his birth. 

As regards Paraśurāma, the Nirpayasindhu quotes the Bhārgavārcanadspikā973 to the effect that Visnu himself was born as the son of Roņukā on Vaišākha, bright half, 3rd tithi, on Punarvasu naksatra in the first quarter of the night, when six planets were in exaltation and Rāhu was in Mithuna (Gemini, Twins). The Moon being in Punarvasu, that is either in Mithuna or Karkata, none of which is Moon's ucca all the remaining six planets must be held to be in exaltation, Thoro fore, Paraśurāma's horoscope must be supposed to be somewhat like this:

This horoscope cannot be right. The ucca signs of the Sun and Mercury are Mesa (Aries) and Kanyā (Virgo) respectively. Mercury cannot be so far away from the Sun. So this is only a fancy horoscope without any reality behind it. 

Coming to historical times, Bāṇabhatta974 in the Harsacarita ( 4th Ucchrāsa ) tells us that Harsa was born on the 12th of the dark half of the month of Jyaştha, on Kṛttikā naksatra, at night fall when all the planets were in exaltation. But Bāņa is delightfully vague about the name of the lagna and it is not clear what he means by 'all planets' being in exaltation. At the end of Jyestha the Sun cannot be in Meşa, which is the ucca of the Sun, but may be in Vrsabha or Mithuna. 

The commentary Sudhāvidyotini 975 on the Saundaryalahari, a work attributed to the great philosopher Sankarācārya, furnishes a horoscope of Sankarācārya, viz. the lagna was Simha (Lion), Jupiter in Fishes, Sun in Ram, Mercury was in Mithuna, Venus in Fishes, Saturn in Aquarius, Mars in Capricornus, Moon swallowed by Rāhu (there was an eclipse) and in Hasta or Citrā (either in Kanyā or Tulā). This horoscope also seems to be a fancy one, since Mercury cannot be in Mithuna when the Sun is in Mesa.

History of Dharmasastra [ Sec. II. CH. XVI) 

Kalhaņa976 in the Rājatarangiņi says that king Harsa of Kashmir( born 1059 A.D., ruled 1089-1101 A.D.) was born on the Karkata lagna when Mars and Saturn were in the 5th house, Jupiter and Mercury in the 6th, Venus and the Sun in the 7th and the Moon in the 10th, that like Duryodhana he caused the extinction of his family as the astrological conjuction at his birth indicated and as the authors of Sarhitus declared that Kauravas destroyed their families because in their horoscopes the Moon, Venus and malefic planets were in the 10th, 7th and 5th houses. This horoscope may be true, as Kalhana wrote only about fifty years after Harsa's death. 

Some inscriptions show that kings rowarded men for astro logical devices. For example, the Kadaba plates of the Rāstrakūta king Prabhūtavarşa Govindarāja III granted in sake 735 to a Jain Muni the village of Jālamangala for having warded off the evil influence of Saturn from Vimalāditya, one of his governors. 977 

Some of the previous volumes of this History of Dharma śāstra have been criticized in two different ways by critics. Some said that the author should have stopped at describing what transformations several of the topics dealt with underwent in the course of centuries and that no personal opinions should have been expressed about what changes should be made in the present or in future. Another set of scholars complained that the author should have expressed his personal views in many matters on which he expresses no definite opinion or does not advance a definite theory of his own. Bearing in mind these criticisms the author proposes to indicate his own personal views on Indian Astrology in relation to Dharmaśāstra. 

Modern scientists, philosophers and theologians have gene rally ignored astrology. Some ridicule it, some have condemned it as superstitious, as 'a delusion and a snare'. In spite of the condemnation by eminent scientists astrology enjoys great vogue among millions of people in the educated West. Many of those who condemned it in scathing terms appear to have done 80 on a priori arguments and do not appear to have studied

How Astrology should have been attacked 

631 

astrological works. The more effective method would perhaps have been to study the horoscopes of well-known persons, to examine them by the rules of the astrologers themselves, to show that the application of their own rules leads to contradictions, confusion and absurd results and lastly to exhibit that the principles on which they evolve their rules and make their predictions have hardly any basis in fact and are imaginary. 

The fundamental doctrine of astrology that the Sun, the Moon and the planets exert some influence on terrestrial life and things is scientific. 978 The matter to be considered is whether the principles laid down in such astrological works as the Bșhajjātaka can stand rational analysis and tests. The author may state here that in his boyhood there was an astrologer called Mahādkar Jyotishi who never took money, who was employed as a bailiff in a civil court in the Bombay State and who cor rectly stated the lagna and the positions of the planets in the horoscopes of people by looking for a few minutes at their faces, eyes and hands. The percentage of his mistakes in this respect was very low, barely one to five percent. This led many educated people to believe in those days that astrological works may be right so far that the physical features of a man may have some relation to the planets and their positions at his birth. But, when he set about the business of stating important facts about the lives of the persons whose horoscopes he correctly stated he often went wrong. One cannot also ignore the facts that some predictions turn out to be true, Unless one holds that they are all mere inexplicable co-incidences, they require to be carefully considered. There is an astrological sanad (grant) which records most wonderful and detailed predictions that came out to be true. The grant was made in 1793 A. D. to one Chinto Mahadeo Gole by Govindrao Gaikwad, a scion of the Gaikwad family that ruled in Gujarat at Baroda. It recites 979 that Govindrao Gaikwad had to leave his inheritance at Baroda and stayed near Poona for twenty-five years, that thereafter he con sulted Chinto who was a great astrologer, and it was agreed that he should make a prediction after consulting śāstras as to when Govindrao would be able to recover his inheritance and if the prediction proved true Govindrao agreed to donate to Chinto a village yielding five thousand rupees yearly revenue. The grant

History of Dharmaśāstra [ Sec. II, Ch. XVII 

further recites that the astrologer gave to Govindrao a closed letter which stated that the Peshwa at Poona would call Govindrao to his presence in the first watch of Friday, 8th tithi, Mārgaśīrsa dark half of śake 1714 (7th December 1792 A. D.) when the sign ascending would be Dhanus (Archer) and, after taking from Govindrao an agreement to give certain cash and to cede some territory, would restore him to his inheritance and honour him by the present of three sirpeñch ( turban ornaments or spray of gems) containing 45 rubies and 14 diamonds (out of which three would be large and eleven small), one pearl crest (con taining about 496 pearls ), ono elephant and one blue horse. It is further recited in that sanad that the letter stated that even after this Govindrao would have to stay for eleven months in Poona out of which he would suffer for eight months great calamities, that thereafter the Peshwa would return to Govindrao the territories he had agreed to cede, that he would then return to Baroda in the month of Māgha. The sanad in the end recites that all this that was contained in the closed letter came to be true to the very letter and therefore as agreed before the village of Ayana was donated. It would be noticed in what details the prediction entered. There is no reason to doubt the solemn words of this grant that everything as predicted came out to be true. How the astrologer pointed out all these details is not at all clear, as no astrological work that I know of, enters into such detailed predictions or gives rules for that purpose. 

Just as the Sun and the Moon influence terrestrial pheno mena such as the tides, the author feels from the instance of the Mahadkar Jyotishi mentioned above and from the hundreds of horoscopes that he has seen that it might be possible to state the physical characteristics of the persons concerned from their horoscopes. But no such efforts have been made by anybody nor published if made. The author, bowever, feels also that hardly anything can be said about the mental capacities of a person or the fortunes and vicissitudes of his life from his horo scope. It would not be relevant to enter into further discussion of this matter in this work. 

What firm grip astrological considerations had on the minds of people and writers on astrology is demonstrated by certain rules in astrological works about a child's birth on Aśleşā or Jyesthā nakşatra or on what is called Ganda or Gandanta and how it was recommended that the innocent and helpless infant born on these supposed very unlucky times should be abandoned 

Concerning child born on unlucky nakşatra 

633 

in spite of what love and pity should dictate. We have seen above that the roots of this belief go back to the Atharvaveda (vide note 753 above ). Some Verses are translated here. Garga quoted in Prayogapārijāta 90 prescribes a child born on Gandānta by day causes the father's death, one born in the night on Gandānta causes the mother's death and one born at twilight causes its own death; no Ganda is safe (free from danger). Abandonment of children born on Ganda is laid down or ( the father ) should avoid seeing it or hearing its cry for six months'. Bhallata 981 provides a child born during the period of the last ghatikā of Jyesthā and the first two ghatikās of Mūla should be abandoned or the father should not see its face for eight years; in the case of a child born on the first quarter (of Mūla) the father dies, if born in the second quarter of Mūla the mother dies, if born in the third quarter there is loss of wealth and (birth in ) the 4th quarter ( of Mūla ) is auspicious; the same results follow in the case of birth on Āśleşā but in the reverso order from the last quarter of it.' The author knows the case of his father's first cousin who was born to his father when the latter was over forty years of age and when he had been long and anxiously waiting for a son, that was born on an unlucky quarter of Māla naksatra. The astrologers recommended that the child be abandoned at the foot of a sacred tree. The father absolutely refused to accept the advice, saying that he would rather gladly die than abandon an innocent and anxiously desired son. The author saw the father when he had lived beyond 80, and the son also reached a pretty old age. 

Ptolemy subscribed to the geocentric hypothesis and in order to account for the puzzling movements of the planets adopted the theory of eccentric orbits and epicycles. Though his theories viewed in the light of modern astronomical science were wrong,

he and his followers could predict eclipses. That suggests that correct inferences may be drawn in certain cases from premises some of which may be wrong. Besides, no one appears to have examined the theory of Varāhamihira and his followers that a horoscope is only like a sketch or plan that indicates only future trends in a man's life depending on his actions in his previous life or lives. It is not probable that this theory will ever be tested and examined. There are weighty and practical reasons for this. Millions of people are not at all interested in knowing what they did in their past lives nor do many of them believe in metempsychosis or the theory of past and future lives of the individual soul. They are mainly concerned with predictions about their future. The theory of horoscopes being only sketches or maps indicating future tendencies cuts the very ground from under the feet of professional astrologers. They would, if they persisted only in telling their clients mere future tendencies and did not furnish positive predictions, find that their occupation was gone. In the minds of millions not only in India but in many parts of the world astrology is a living faith and it appears that neither scientists nor historians can possibly destroy such a tenaciously held and deep-seated belief. But the belief that planets cause persong to do certain things is likely to have Berious consequences. The sense of moral responsibility for all acts done by a person will bs impaired by such a belief; and a person guilty of a crime may plead (or may at least believe ) that he was helpless before the influence of the heavenly bodies. 

Before closing this brief account of Indian astrology I must in a few words advert to a work called Bhrgusamhita in Sanskrit which is supposed to contain numberless horoscopes with descriptions of persons born on the twelve rāśis from Meşa on wards, references to the deeds of such persons in previous lives, the horoscope with the positions of the several planets, the important happenings in each person's present life from the year of his birth to his death. Persons who profess to have in their possession the Bhrgusamhitā are generally averse to showing the whole work to any one, but read to those who consult them verses from the work said to be in their possession and people feel often amazed at the accounts about themselves which are read out to them. There is much of deception in this. I have examined four Mas, in the Desai Collection of Sanskrit miss. in the Bombay University called Bhrgusamhitā said to have been imparted to Sukra by his father Bhrgu on mount GandhamiBhrgusamhita 

635 

dana which contain about 600 horoscopes each of the four lagnas, Mesa, Vrsabha, Mithuna and Karka, describing in 15 to 20 verses each of the horoscopes in the same lagna but with different positions of the planets in each case. No Bhrgusamhita can be accommodated oven in a big library if it contains des criptions of all possible horoscopes in 15 or 20 verses each. There are twelve rāśis as lagnas, 9 planots ( including Rāhu and Ketu ) and twelve bhāvas. By permutations and combinations of these there would be crores of possible horoscopes and if at least 15 verses were to be assigned to each there would be millions on millions of verses. Hence describing a horoscope by extracta from Bhrgusamhitā is often a fraud. 

In Indian Astrology the most important matters are the rāśis, the planets and the twelve bhāvas (or places ). Take the rāśis first. What is the reason for naming certain groups of stars or constellations as Mesa or Vrsabha &c.? There are no Rams and Bulls in the sky. Some observers on the earth imagined that certain constellations presented to the eye the appearance of certain animals, human figures and mythical beings. As shown above (p. 565 ) the Chinese and Japanese name them differently. Therefore, there is a great element of arbitrariness and ima ginary analogies in naming the so-called rāśis. Once named, the rāśis are classified in various ways and predictions are based on the class to which a rāśi belongs. All these classifications are based on ideas of symmetrical sequence and fancy. Why should Meşa and Mithuna ( which is represented as 'twins' man and woman) be called male, while Vrsabha and Vrścika be classed as female? There is no explanation except this that the twelve rāśis had to be classified in two groups, male and female, and symmetry required that they be alternately called male and female. For the same reason of symmetrical order Meşa and Karka are grouped as cara ( mobile ), wbile Simba and Vršcika are classified as sthira (firm immobile ). The Sun ( the giver of all light and support of the world) is called krūra or papa (a malefic ) planet along with Mars and Saturn, while Jupiter and Venus are classed as beneficent and the waning Moon is also held to be malefic. Here association of ideas and analogy play a great part. Jupiter and Venus are both brilliant and white or whitish, while Mars is red (the colour of blood). Ben sides, the first two are supposed to be the preceptors of the gods and usuras respectively. Therefore, they are beneficent and the blood-red Mars is malefic. The Sun, Jupiter and Mars are said 

636 

History of Dharmaśāstra (Sec. II, Ch. XVII 

to be masculine, the Moon and Venus feminine and Mercury and Saturn neuter for the same reason, viz. association of ideas and analogy. The Moon and Venus are beautiful and mild, therefore they are feminine, while the Sun (that has fierce heat), Mars ( with blood red hue ) and Jupiter (the ācārya of the gods ) are masculine. Modern astronomy declares that the Moon is dry and waterless and contains the remains of extinct volcanoes; yet if the astrologers be followed we shall have to regard the Moon as feminine. In classical Sanskrit the Moon is called 

• Saśānka'. The Japanese Moon Goddess Gwaten is drawn with a bare. Vide figure opposite p. 18 in Prof. Zinner's The stars above us.' Then we may consider the doctrines of svagrhas and uccas (exaltations of planets). There are twelve rāśis and seven planets; five must be given two rāśis as svagthas and the other two only one rāśi each as svagsha. The Br. J. assigns only one rāśi as svagsha to the Sun and Moon, viz. Simha (Lion) and Karka (Crab) respectively, while two rāśis are assigned to each of the other five planets. There is absolu tely no logical or satisfactory explanation of this. Moreover, in assigning two rāśis as svagshas the only principle that seems to have been followed is that of sequence, viz. one rāśi beyond Simba and one beyond Karka i. e. Kany, and Mithuna to Mercury and in the same way to the remaining planets in the order of distance. The result is that Vrsabha and Tula (Scales) are the svaghas of the beautiful and brilliant planet Venus and Dhanus (Archer) and Mina (Fishes) are the svagȚhas of Jupiter. If one turns to the doctrine of exaltation, no rational or astronomical explanation is given why Aja (goat), Vrsabha (Bull ), Makara, Kanyā, Karka, Mina and Tulā should be the uccas of the Sun, the Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus and Saturn respectively. The naming and arrangement of the twelve bhāvas hardly follows any rational basis. One may at the most concede that the first bhāva in which the sign rising at a person's birth is placed is plausibly called tanu (body) and that regarding the 7th bhāva therefrom as the one on which love and marriage may be considered has also some plausibility. Birth and death are the two ends of a person's life. If the first bhāva is called tanu, the bhāva about death should be the 12th, the last, but in the Bṛhaj-jātaka and other works, it is the 8th bhāva that is called mrtyu ( death). Some of the bhāvas have too many matters crowded into them. For example, the 4th bhava is supposed to be the one on which a person's relatives, friends, house, happiness and conveyance are to be considered. 

Matters depending on 5th bhāva 

637 

The fifth bhāva is concerned with sons, intellect, learning, speech. Supposing that that bhāva is very favourably placed, the prognostications would have to be that the person would have many sons, he would be a learned man and a good speaker. But all these very rarely go together. A man of great intellect has often no sons, while a very learned man is often not a good speaker. 

Then there is the question of friendships and enmitieg among planets. There is no rhyme nor reason in this respect, Why Venus, a beneficent planet in theory, should be the enemy of the Sun, when Jupiter another beneficent planet is a friend, is something which it is difficult to understand or explain. Besides, these relationships are not reciprocal. The Moon has no enemy, but from the point of view of Venus, the Moon is the enemy of Venus. Mercury (mythologically the son of the Moon ) is said to be a friend of the Moon, but from the point of view of Mercury the Moon is its enemy. There is a further strange matter to be noticed. As men fight among themselves, it has been supposed that the planets (excepting the Sun and the Moon ) fight among themselves 982 ( vide note 872 above ). Besides there are thousands of minor planets between Mars and Jupiter and ancient and medieval horoscopes took no account of Uranus, Neptune and Pluto among the planets nor of the numerous satellites of Jupiter. 

Another important doctrine in Indian astrology is that of drsti ( glance, aspect) which has been explained above ( note 876). That doctrine had some plausibility when the distances between the planets and the stars were not known. But in view of modern astronomical knowledge the doctrine of the destis of planets has hardly any meaning. Every planet and star really

It deals with the astrological results of eyes to specific countries, kings, and people. Three verses are quoted here. Talgaigheare:

History of Dharmasāstra (Sec. II, Ch. XVII 

faces every other planet and star in this vast Universe at all times unless there happens to be another celestial object in the line connecting any two of them and it is very difficult to understand how one planet can look at another planet or star at a quarter or a half or ths aspect ( i. e. at various angles ). 

When an astrologer says that a planet (say Venus ) is in its svagrha (own house ) i. e. Vrşabha (Bull) with the Moon let us understand what it means. The rāśi Vṛsabha is constituted by many stars, the most brilliant of which is Rohiņi ( Aldebaran ). Light travels at 186000 miles a second and modern astronomy finds that light takes 57 years to reach the earth from Aldebaran, The position then is this that the observer on the earth sees the Moon, Venus and Aldebaran very near each other. According to modern astronomy the Moon is only about two hundred and forty thousands miles from the earth, Venus a few crores of miles from it and Aldebaran billions of billions of miles away. They appear to be near only on account of the effect of perspec tive. This creates difficulties which the astrologers altogether ignore. When an observer sees Aldebaran to-day the rays he sees today started some 57 years ago, while the rays of Mars are seen within a few minutes of their start and of the Moon almost immediately. 

The principles of rāśi astronomy were probably established in India in the three centuries preceding the Christian era. The predecessors of Varahamihira and Varāhamihira himself saw Meşa, Vļşabha and other rāśis occupying certain definite sectors of the Zodiac and propounded certain rules about the physical and mental characteristics and professions of persons born when the Moon was in Meşa and the other rāśis ( in chap. 17 of the Bṛ. J.) and also of persons born on Mesa and the other rāśis, when the Sun, Mars and the other planets occupied those signs (ibid. chap. 18). The zodiacal section where Vrsabha stood about two thousand years ago is now occupied by the constel lations comprising Meşa ( Ram ) owing to procession. How can the astrological consequences of being born on Taurus two thousand years ago be the same now when Taurus does not occupy the Zodiacal sector which it occupied then and when that particular sector is occupied now by Aries ? 

The above discussion is enough to show the flaws in the teachings of Indian astrology and would lead thoughtful persons 

Addition of astrological details in later works 

639 

to conclude that the rules of astrology should have very little influence in determining the times of their undertakings. It appears that astrological details which were conspicuous by their absence in ancient Dharmaśāstra works have attained so much growth during the last two thousand years that the fundamental religious requirements have been smothered thereby. Those who believe that all events affecting men are necessitated by the planets and stars appear to go wrong in two ways. They thereby deprive God of control and providence in human affairs and they take away man's free will. The dilemma is that if astrologers cannot stop or foil what the planets indicate, what is the use or benefit of their prescience; if they can stop or frustrate what is deemed to be fated to happen how can they support the thesis that planets compel events ? 

The question arises then how far religious matters, such as Upanayana and marriage, should be regulated by astrological considerations. It has been already shown above (p. 606 and p. 610 ) how the astrological requirements for Upanayana and marriage were very few and simple in the times of the gļhya sūtras and the Manusmrti (i, e. geveral centuries before the christian era), how later writers went on adding one requirement after another and how even in the 11th century A. D. orthodox works like the Rājamārtanda advised neglect of all astrological requirements in the case of girls whose marriages had to be postponed very long for some reason or other. Therefore, in respect of religious ceremonies like Upanayana and marriage the author would advise, as a first step towards getting rid of oppressive and meaningless astrological conditions, that people should revert to the simple rules of the gļhyasūtras and Manu. There are two views on the observance of the rules about the details of religious rites. One is that a person* need not go beyond the provisions contained in the gṛhyasūtra of his own Veda or sākha and that when one observes those provisions he would be deemed to have performed all that the sāstra requires of him. The second view (held by a majority of medieval writers of digests) was that one should include in a religious rito details mentioned in works of other sākhās, though not mentioned in his own sākhā, provided the former details are not

in direct conflict with the details in his own śākhā.94 These people follow what is called the 'sarvaśākhā-pratyayanyāya' of the Pūrvamimāngā. Both these view-points bave been explained at great length by the author in H. of Dh. vol. III p. 870 and vol. IV pp. 852-855. In these times one may at most follow the astrological rules provided by the sūtras and Manu. Though the author has pointed out great flaws in the whole structure of Indian astrology, he does not think that it is his duty as a mere historian of Dharmaśāstra to advise people how far they should accept or discard astrology in general.

CHAPTER XVIII 

Calendar, eras, various reckonings about years, 

months &c. 

In order to be able to perform vratas and celebrate utsaras at the proper times and in order to find out the appropriate times for religious rites like sacrifices, upanayana and marriage people require a calendar or almanac. A calendar is a methodi cal combination or book about days, months and years for the purpose of registering in advance religious festivals and astro nomical or astrological phenomena and for purposes of civil life. In India about thirty calendars are in use by Christians, Parsis, Moslems and Hindus. Confining oneself to Hindus there is a bewildering variety of calendars in use at present. Some are based on the data of the Sūryasiddhānta and some on those of the Aryasiddhānta, while others follow comparatively later manuals like the Grahalāghava; some begin the year with Caitra sukla pratipad (or pratipadā), others with Kārtika sukla pratipad and there are small tracts like the Halar %85 prānt ( in Kathiawad) where the year begins with the 1st day of the bright half of Āsādha. Gujarat and North India except Bengal use the Vikrama era, while the Deccan and South India geno rally employ the Saka year, but Kashmir follows the Laukika reckoning. In some parts (North India and Telangana) and communities the months are pūrnimānta (i. o. end with Full Moon), while other parts ( Bengal, Mahārāstra and south India) follow the amānta (month ending with amāvāsyā) reckoning, The result is that some fasts and celebrations universally observed throughout India such as the Ekadasi and Sivaratri fasts and the celebrations of the birth of Srikrsna are observed on two different days in different parts of the country and by different sects and there is a difference of one month between the days of some observances i. e. while on the pūrpimānta reckoning a cer tain festival may be observed in Āśvina dark half, the same mouth

may be called Bhadrapada dark half ( by amanta reckoning ) and the same festival may be celebrated one month later. The con fusion is worse confounded in modern times by some calendars being what are called Drk or Dşkpratyaya based on the data of the Nautical Almanac in order that such happenings as eclipses predicted in the pañcānga may be found to tally exactly with what is actually seen by the people. It appears that in South India there are rather too many pañcāngas ( calendars ). In Tamilnad there are two kinds of pañcāngas, one is based on drk-gamita, the other is based on the Vakya method ( that follows medieval calculations based on Aryabhata which produce less accurate results). There is the Pudukottai pañcānga ( a Vākya one ) issued under the authority of the rājas of the principality of that name. The Srirangam pañcānga (a Vākya one ) is used by the Srivaisnavas, while followers of another Vaisnava sect, the Mādhvas, have a pañcānga of their own. The Kanjanur pancānga is the most common Vākya pancānga used by the smārtas who do not use the dȚk-ganita pañcānga issued under the authority of the Sankarācārya. The Telugus follow the Siddhānta-candra %6 pañcānga based on the Grahalāghava of Ganośa composed in sake 1442 (1520 A. D.). In Malabar the people have a drk-pancānga, but it is based on a revision of the old Malabar system called Parahita and is not the dřk-pañçānga followed by the Tamils. The Telugus follow the Cāndra reckon ing and begin their year called Yugādi from Caitra śukla, while the Tamils follow the Saura reckoning, start their Caitra with Meşa Vişu, though, their vratas and religious ceremonies being based on tithis, they have to follow the Candra-māna. Bengalis use solar months and lunar days with triennial adjustment by the insertion of an intercalary month. 

There are three siddhāntas in use, viz. the Sūryasiddhānta (used throughout India on account of its accuracy ), the Ārya siddhānta (relied on in Travancore, Malabar, and by the Mādhyas in Karnātaka and in Tamil Districts of Madras State) and the Brāhma-siddhānta ( followed in Gujerat and Rajputana). The last, however, is losing ground in favour of the first. In the Siddhāntas calculations are made from the epoch of the 

986. Warren's Kālasankalita (pp. 65-69 ) publishes a skeleton of the Siddhāntacandra pañcaāga for the 4924tb luni-solar year of the Kaliyuga current (i, e. sake 1745, A, D. 1822) for the Meridian and Latitude of Madras which is mainly based on Telugu Pancanga, but furnishes Tamil data also. 

Siddhāntas and Karanas 

643 

mahāyuga and are so elaborate that pañcāngas can hardly be made from them direct. Therefore, works called karaṇas based on the Siddhāntas are used to prepare pañcāngas, such as Makaranda in Bengal and the Grahalāghava of Ganesa; the tables of the latter called Tithicintamani are used in the Deccan, Central India and some other parts of India. There are two important points of difference between the Siddhāntas among themselves viz. the length of the year ( but the difference is only of a few vi palas ) and the second is the number of revolutions of the Moon and the planets in the Kalpa or Mahāyuga or Yuga. The Siddhāntaširomani (L 6) specifies the matters with which a siddhanta must deal, the very first of which is the enumeration of the units of time from truti up to the end of pralaya. 

It should not be supposed that India is singular in this respect. The present European calendar is also very unsatis factory. Originally it was Julius Caesar who introduced a revised calendar in 46 B. C. with the provision that every 4th year was to be a leap year. But his calculations were not very accurate and the result was that by 1582 A.D. the spring equinox occurred on 10th March instead of on 21st March. Pope Gregory XIII declared that 4th October 1582 was to be followed by 15th October ( i. e. ten days were dropped). He further provided that century years were not to have a leap year unless they could be divided by 400 (so that yoars 1700, 1800, 1900 of the christian era have no additional day, but 2000 would have one). Even so, there is still a slight error, but only after more than 33 centuries one day would have to be dropped. The Gregorian year is longer by 26 seconds than the correct length of the year arrived at by modern astronomical calculations. Protestant England did not follow Pope Gregory's reform till 1750 A. D. when Acts were passed whereby 2nd of September 1752 was to be followed not by 3rd September but by 14th September ( dropping eleven days). Vide 'the Calendar New Style Act' 1750 (24 Geo. 2, chapter 23) and the Calendar Act 1751 ( 25 Geo. 2, chapter 30), which changed the year beginning from 25th March to 1st January and embodied the reforms made by Pope Gregory XIII. The European calendar is still very inconvenient. Under it a month may have from 28 to 31 days, the quarters of a year consist of 90 to 92 days; the two halves of the year (January to June and July to December ) contain respectively 181 (or 182) and 184 days, working days per month vary from 24 to 27 days and years and months begin on different

week-days. Easter, the Queen of feasts, could fall even after 1751 on 35 different dates from 22nd March to 25th April, as Easter is first Sunday after the Full Moon occurring on or after 21st March 

It has been stated above (p. 480) that this work will not deal with pure astronomical questions; therefore, the author proposes to avoid going into details of astronomical computations. But something would have to be said about them as occasion requires.

Among all nations the fundamental periods of time are the same, viz. the day, the month and the year (consisting ofFundamental periods of time 

645 

seasons). The years are the constituents of eras that are vital for chronology and history. Though the fundamental periods of time are the same, there are variations in the arrangement of days to form months and yoars, about the sub-divisions of the day, about the commencement of the day, about the divisions of the year among seasons and months, about the number of days in each month and in the year and about various kinds of months. The great time measurers are the Sun and the Moon. The day is due to the revolution of the earth round its axis. The month is mainly a lunar phenomenon and the year is due to the apparent motion of the Sun (but in reality it is due to the revolution of the earth round the sun). The tropical year is the time of the passage of the Sun from one vernal equinox to the next. The latter is shorter than the sidereal year (i. e. the time between the two successive arrivals of the Sun at the same fixed star ) by about 20 minutes as the vernal equinox point shifts to the west at the rate of about 50 seconds per year. 97 A modern calendar mentions the current year ( by some era ), the month and the day of the month and generally the week-day, besides several other matters of religious and social interest. The eras and accurate knowledge of the length of the year and the month came to man rather late. The synodic month is a little over 293 days, while the tropical year is a little less than 3651 days. These are incommensurable periods. For ordinary life and calendars whole days are required; besides, the starting of the year and the month must be properly defined and must correspond to seasons and some era must be used. These are the requirements of a calendar which has to be used for civil and religious purposes. The complexity of calendars is due mainly to the incommensurability of the above two astronomical 

987. Besides the two motions of the earth (viz, its daily revolution on its own axis and its yearly revolution round the sun) there is a third motion which is not so well-known. The earth is not a sphere, its equa torial diameter being longer than its polar diameter. The result is that there is a mass of matter bulging out at the equator which is in excess of what it would be if the earth were perfectly spherical, The earth's axis has a sligbt conical wobbliog motion like that of a toy top and it describes a cycle in about 25800 years, the yearly shift being about 50"-2 seconds, due to the pull of the sun and the moon on the equatorial bulge. This causes the appearance of the fixed stars and even the pole-star changiog their positions from century to century or from period to period. Vide Sir Norman Lockyer's 'Dawn of astronomy. pp. 124-128, Van Pep Bergb in 'Universe in Space and Time' p. 82, Hickey's 'Introduciog the Universe p. 117

periods. The Moslems solved it by ignoring the length of the tropical year and holding fast by the Moon as the measurer of time. They had a purely lunar year. The result was that the Moslems' year was of 354 days and that in about 33 years all their festivals travelled through all the months of the year. On the other hand, the ancient Egyptians ignored the moon as the measurer of time and their year was of 365 days (12 months of 30 days each plus five apagomenal, i. e. additional days). Their priests stuck to this system for 3000 years, they had no leap years or intercalary months. Most ancient peoples including Indians followed a luni-solar calendar and tried to adjust the junar months to the solar year by the system of intercalary months. It has been seen above (p. 489 note 710 ) that even the Rgveda speaks of an additional month (in I. 25.8) but how it was arrived at and where in the scheme of months it was intro duced we do not know. We know that the Vedāngajyotisa 98 added two months in five years. The people of those ancient times had to solve the problem of adjusting the reckoning of the months by the moon and the years by the sun. People wanted to know in advance when the Full Moon or New Moon on which many ancient festivals were celebrated may be expected, when to expect monsoon or winter, when to prepare ground for sowing and when to sow. Sacrifices had to be in spring and other seasons, as also on New Moon and Full Moon. The lunar year of 354 days was less by about 11 days than the solar year. Therefore, the seasons would shift back if the lunar year alone were observed. Hence intercalary months were introduced by several nations. The Greeks had the 'Octaeteris' (eight years cycle ), that contained 99 months of which three were inter calary, viz. in the 3rd, 5th and 8th years. Then was introduced the Motonic cycle of 19 years in which occurred seven inter calary months (19 x 12 plus 7 = 235 ). Olmstead ( in American Journal of Semitic Languages, vol. 55 for 1938 ) says at p. 116 that the cycle of intercalation in Babylon was of eight years and that it was followed by the Greeks. Fotherigham (in Journal of Hellenistic studies, vol. 39 p. 179 ) says that intercalation in Babylon was irregular till 528 B. C. and in Greece it was un systematic in the 5th and 4th centuries B.C. Vide also C. R. C. Report pp. 175-176.

Eras 

647 

The use of oras in India for calendrical purposes is not much older than about two thousand years. Continuous era reckoning first began to be employed in the records of the Indo-Scythian kings that ruled over modern Afganistan and North Western India between about 100 B. C. and 100 A. D. This is not pecu liar to India; most of the ancient civilizations such as those of Egypt, Babylon, Greece and Rome did not employ a continu ously running era till late in their careers. In the Jyotirvidā bharaṇa ( which is a later fabrication, though it professes that it was finished in galakali 3068 i. e. 33 years before the christian era ) mentions the names of six persons as the founders of eras in Kaliyuga, viz. Yudhisthira, Vikrama, Sālivāhana, Vijayābhi nandana, Nāgārjuna, Kalkin 989 and states that their eras respectively last for 3044, 135, 18000, 10000, 400000, 821 years. In ancient 990 countries no continuous era was used, but only regnal years were employed. In India also Asoka employs only regnal years in his edicts (e. g the 4th pillar edict at Lauriya nandana-garh and the 5th pillar edict at Rāmpurvā, C.I.I. vol.

In ancient times, the year had six seasons, twelve months and 30 days in each month, The Arthasastra here says that there were six fortnights of 29 days each and so the (lunar year was of 354 days. In order to bring it in line with the solar year an intercalary month bad to be resorted to..

of revenue specifies the times with which the collector would be concerned as 'the royal year, the month, the fortnight, the day &c.' This practice continued even under the Kusaņas and Sātavāhanas; vide Lūder's list in E.I. X, No. 22, 32 for Kaniska, No. 1024 (Kanheri cave Inscription of Gotamiputa-sāmi-Siriyaña Sātakapi), No. 1100 and 1122 ( Karle and Nasik cave inscrip. tions of Vāsithīputa Siri-Pulumāvi). The Kalinga king Khāra vela (generally assigned to the 2nd century B. C.) uses only regnal years and no era ( vide E. I. vol. 20 p. 71 at pp. 79-80 ). 

A variety of eras have been used in India for hundreds of years; this has created a great deal of confusion in chronology and history. For the lists of eras now in use or met with in inscriptions and Sanskrit literature, vide Cunningham on Indian eras, 'Indian Ephemeris' by Swamikannu Pillai vol. I part 1 pp. 53-55, V. B. Ketkar's 'Indian and foreign chronology' pp. 171–172; P. C. Sen-Gupta in ' Ancient Indian eras'(pp. 222-238) and Dr. Saha's paper in ' Science and Culture'for 1952 (Calcutta) at p. 116 that gives a table of eras with the starting year of the eras, their current years, year beginnings (solar and luni-solar), lunar month end, provenance &c. Vide also p. 258 of the C.R.C. Repost ( Table 27 ) for a similar long list of eras. In this work only a few eras of importance will be briefly dealt with. Alberuni (Sachau vol. II, p. 5) names five eras, viz of Sri Harsha, Vikramaditya, Saka, Valabha and Gupta. He gives two different versions about the first and leaves the question undecided. 

Differing views were held even in ancient times, as to when the Kaliyuga 92 started and what event the Kaliyuga era commemorates. At present the Kaliyuga era is supposed to have started in 3102 B. C. and a past Kaliyuga year is to be arrived at by adding 3101 to the A. D. years. There are four principal views about the starting point, viz. (1) the starting point is when Yudhisthira ascended the throne; (2) it is 36 

992. Vide JRAS for 1911 pp. 479-96 and 675-698 (Dr. Fleet), H. of Dh, vol. III pp. 896-902 for discussions about the Kaliyuga beginning. In 

Ancient Indian chronology' Prof. Sen-Gupta after a lengthy and somewhat vehement argument concludes that the date of the Bharata battle is 2449 B. C. and that the year 3102 B, C. for it is wrong (p. 1-59). Vide C.R.C. Report pp. 252-254 for Kaliyuga era. It may be noted that Janamejaya, son of Pariksit, is mentioned as the performer of an Asva med ba sacrifice in Sat: Br. XIII. 5.4. Wbether he is the same as the Mahābhārata bero is more than one can say, but it is not uplikely that he is the same,

years later when Yudhisthira crowned as king Pariksit, the grandson of Arjuna; (3) according to the Puranas 993 Kaliyuga. started when Krsna passed away (vide Visnupurana IV. 24. 108 to 113);(4) According to 993 a to Varāhamihira, 2426 years prior to the starting of Saka-kāla, Yudhisthira era started i. e. 653 years after the start of Kaliyuga according to the 2nd view. The Aihole inscription appears to follow the 2nd view, since it equates 994 556 śaka year with 3735 Kaliyuga year (past). One of the earliest references to the Kaliyuga era is that by Āryabhata who states that he was twenty-three years old when 3600 years of Kaliyuga had expired (i. e. he was born in 476 A. D.).995 There is an early Cola record dated 4044 of the Kaliyuga era (i. e. 943 A. D.). Vide JRAS for 1911 pp. 689 694 for several instances of the employment of Kaliyuga era in inscriptions. Medieval Indian astronomers believed that all planets (including the sun and the moon) were together at sunrise on Sunday of Caitra sukla pratipad at the beginning of Kaliyuga and also of Kalpa.595a It is suggested by modern writers like Burgess and Dr. Saha that this epoch was arrived at by astronomical calculations carried back-ward at a late period and is a mere fiction (vide p. 253 of the C. R.C. Report). It is rather difficult to hold that this was all pure imagination on the part

of the ancient Siddhānta writers; it is more probable that they had a persistent tradition of long standing before them. 995. 

In the Sankalpa (declaratory formula) for every religious ceremony the performer has to mention the grand divisions and sub-divisions of time beginning with Svetavārāhakalpa, such as Vaivasvata manvantara, Kaliyuga and its first quarter together with the geographical position of the place of performance in 

Bharatavarşa, and the Zodiacal signs occupied by the Sun, Jupiter and other planets, the era, name of year (Jovian), the month, the fortnight, the tithi, naksatra, Yoga and Karaña. A verse of Devala states that if a man performing a religious rite does not mention the month, the fortnight, the tithi and the occasion (of the rite ) he will not reap the merit of the rite.9%, That is the importance of eras, years and its sub-divisions in the religious life of our people. Therefore a calendar ( pañcūnga) is absolutely necessary for every religious Hindu. 

The origin and use of the Vikrama era are as much shrouded in doubts and mystery as is the case with the saka era.997 Doubts have been expressed as to whether there was any king called

A. D. year plus 57. In certain rather early inscriptions, years are referred to as Krta. For example, in Nandsa Yūpa Inscrip tion the Krta year 282 is mentioned and in three Maukhari In scriptions on yūpis (sacrificial posts ) the year 295 Krta is found.999 The Bijayagad pillar Inscription is dated in Krta 428, the Mandasor Inscription in Kṛta 461 and the Gangadhar Inscrip tion in Krta 480. 1000 Scholars are generally agreed that the Krta era is a precursor of the Vikraina era. But the name Krta applied to the years has not been satisfactorily explained. 1001 

998. K. P. Jayaswal ( I. A. vol. 47 p. 112 and I, A 46 pp. 145–153 ) holds that Vikrama was historical, ended the rule of Nahapana-Sakendra in 58 B. C, and belonged to the Sātavāhana family.

1001. Vide Bombay University Journal vol. 17 pp. 19-25 where Prof, K. B.

Mookerjee mentions Dine Inscriptions in the Krta or Mālava-gana era and coatends that Kṛta is the era started by Kalkin who is supposed to have ushered in the Krta-yuga in the 5th century B. C. The author does not agree with both these views. Prof. Sen-Gupta in 'Ancient Indian Chronology' pp. 238 ff. holds that the Kyta eta started in 63 B, C. His grounds are that certain Mabābhārata and Paura nic passages set out in a prophetic vein the circumstances when Krta-yuga will start and he holds that those conditions were satisbed about 63 B. C. and therefore the era was called Krta In the first place the passages refer to a future date. No one thought in ancient India that the start of the Kṛta age was near. Besides, one of the passages on wbich he relies is Maha bhārata, Vanaparva 190. 90-91 ( of the Bombay edition) and 188 87 (of the critical BORI edition) and is differently read in the Sāradā Codex and several Kasmir Mss. viz. as Y SI UN TOT FETOT Frari Fiat FHOUT

Some inscriptions are also dated in the era of the Mālava-gapa (Malava tribe ), as e. g. the Mandasor 1002 Inscription of Naravarman. The Kșta and Mālava era are held to be identical and the inscriptions so far discoverved as dated in these two eras are found in eastern Rajasthan and Western Malva. It is further to be noted that, whereas we have inscriptions in 282 and 295 of the Krta year, no inscription of the Mālava era has yet been found that is dated so early. It is possible that Krta is the earlier name and when the Mālavas adopted the same era it came to be called 'Malava-ganāmnāta' or 'Mālava-gana-sthiti.' But it may be remarked that if Krta and Mālava both refer to what later became the Vikrama era, they were both being used con currently for at least one nundred years, as we have the Kṛta era 

(Continued from last page) Brahmānda III 74, 225 po doubt read it. The three Matsya-purana verses he quotes are not from the same chapter. The first verse simply says that Visou created Yavas on 3rd tithi of Vaisakha bright half and tbat he started Krtayuga on that tithi. It is impossible to draw any definite date from this verse by itself. The other two verses are Matsya 65, 2-3. They describe a vrata and fast on 3rd titbi of the bright half of Vaišākba, which yield inexbaustible fruits to the performer, equal to all good deeds. If on that tithi when joined to Krttikā one does special worship, whatever is donat ed or offered in the fire and whatever mantras are recited become inexhaustible, These two verses contain not a word about Krtayuga and the first says nothing about Kṛttikā. It is, to say the least, a strange method to put to gether verses apart from their context and aver that a particular date has been established, 

1002. Vide I. A, vol. 42 (1913 ) p. 161-163 for Mandasor Inscription of Naravarman which is dated the 5th of the bright half of Asvoja of the Mālava year 461 ( 404 A, D.) as traditionally handed down by the Mālava tribe ( Mālavaganāmnāta). The important verse is : ffarga yozarā ancha Hista i VÉTI HIÊ Franz In the Mandasor Pillar Ioscription of Yasodharman occur the words 'मालवगणस्थितिवशात्कालज्ञानाय लिखितेषु। (year 589 of Mālava era); vide Gupta Ios. No. 35 at p. 154). On Algarrorrfura, vide Prof. Shembavnekar in J. I, H, vol. X pp. 143-155, where (on p. 145) he holds that 'ganasthiti' is equal to ganadāpaddbati'. His arguments though plausible are not correct. There should be contemporary authority (of tbe 5th or 6th century A. D.) for 'gana' meaning 'gananā'. In the Bijaygadh stope Ias. (Gupta Ins. No, 58 p. 251 ) we come across the words intaru CHFY HETTISTAETH arva: &c.'. Therefore 'Mālava-ganasthiti' should really mean 'the usage of the Mālavagana' and T rata: should meao 'as traditionally handed down among the Mālavagana'. Besides a * Mālavagana-visaya' mentioned in the Nandsa Yūpa inscription edited in E, I., vol. 27, p. 252 at p. 259 makes it almost certain that Mālavagapa means 'Mālava tribe' and nothing else,

480 and also the Mālava era year 461. The author does not think it possible that the word Krta was applied to the era because it was believed at its foundation that the Krta-yuga had started. It is possible that Krta has the same meaning as siddha (just as krtānta means siddhānta ) and it indicates that it was establi shed by agreement among certain people. The Vikrama era is specifically mentioned by name only from about 8th or 9th century A. D. 10024 Besides, the Vikrama era has hardly ever been employed in Sanskrit astronomical works and it is generally 

desiganted samrat to distinguish it from the saka era. The Yedarāve Inscription of Calukya Vikramāditya VI shows that that king superseded the saka era and started a Cālukya Vikrama era the first year of which was 1076-77 A. D. Vide Bombay Gazetteer vol. 1 part 2 p. 447 and 477 (and I, A. VII pp. 61-56 for reference to 400 sakakāla 1478 A. D.). 

Almost all astronomical works in Sanskrit from about 500 A. D. employ the Saka era. Why the Saka era is so called, whether it was to commemorate the coming of the famous Kusāna king Kaniska to the throne or when and where it came to be first used are among the most difficult and unsolved problems of Indian History and Chronology. In one of the earliest inscriptions expressly dated in the Saka era, viz. that of Cālukya king Mangaleśvara in 500 saka (expired, i. e, 578 A.D.) it is cited as the era of the crowning of the Saka 1003 king. Varahamihira speaks of it as Sakakāla ( in the Pañca siddhāntikā 1001 and Bșhat-samhitā 13.3) and as Sakendrakāla

or Sakabhūpakāla (in Brhat-samhita VIII. 20-21 ). Utpala ( about 966 A. D.) while commenting on Bṛhat-saṁhitā (VIII. 20 ) remarks that the Saka era started from the time when the Saka king was killed by Vikramāditya. Its years begin with Caitra for luni-solar reckoning and Mesa for solar reckoning. Its years are generally expired ones and it begins with vernal equinox of 78 A. D. The earliest inscription so far discovered in which the saka era is expressly mentioned is that of Cālukya Vallabheśvara dated in 465 saka (i. e. 543 A. D. )1005 The ins criptions of the Ksatrapa kings that bear the number of the year but no era are generally ascribed to the saka era, e.g. those of Rudradāman in 52 and 72; of Rudrasimha in 103, of Rudrasena in 122 ( Lūder's list Nos. 965, 963, 962). Emperor Kaniska (of the Kusāņa race ) is also connected by some with the foundation of the saka era. 1006 One of the earliest date for the saka era in literature is mentioned as saka 380 in the Jain work Loka vibhāga of Simhasūri. 1007 As the Pañcasiddhantikā (XII. 2) takes the 2nd year of the saka era as the epoch of the Pitamaha siddhānta, it is not too much to assume that the original siddhanta of which a summary is given by Varāhamihira was composed according to him in the first quarter of the first

1981 in note 746 does not stand by itself and has to to be taked along with the other verses in the same work (as in Br. S. VIII. 20-21 ) and strenger in Tasut (vide note 1008); the verse '3114*&c.'says that saka years when added to by 2526 (or 2566) represeat the time of Yudhisthira. The suge gestion made by some that sakakala simply means method of reckoning cannot be accepted in view of the words Sakendrakāla or Sakabhūpakāla. One may raise a dispute as to whether the saka era was founded by a saka king or whether it was founded by an Indian king who defeated the Sakas. But the central fact remains that saka-kāla has something to do with the Sakas and a Saka king.

century of the saka era. 1008 In later medieval and modern times (as also in the Jyotirvidābharaṇa ) the saka era goes by the name of Sālivahana. But the form Sālivāhana as that of the era occurs only in the inscriptions of the 13th or 14th century A. D. e. g. the two earliest inscriptions so far discovered men tioning the word Sālivāhana are those recorded in the plate of Devagiri Yadava king Krsna dated in Salivāhana era 1172 (1251 A. D. ) 1009 and the plate of Bukka I dated in saka 1276, current (1354 A. D.). Vide No. 455 in Kielhorn's list in E. I. VII. It is possible that the name Sātavāhana ( mentioned in Harsa-carita as the composer of the Gāthāsaptašati) was changed into Sālavāhana, then into Sālivāhana and this conjecture is support ed by the fact that in the Gathāsaptaśati ( V. 67 ) king Sālāhana (a Prakrit form of Sātavāhana ) is mentioned; 'only two know how to raise high distressed families (by śleşa, the family of Aparņā ), viz. Siva beloved of the heart of Gauri or the king Sālāhana ( Sātavāhana ).' Vide C. R. C. Report pp. 241-256 for the saka era and Ludwig Bachhofer's paper on 'Greeks and Sakas in India ' in J. A. O. S. vol. 61 (1941 ) pp. 223-250, where he attacks some of the downright and very emphatic assertions of Dr. W. W. Tarn in the Greeks in Bactria and India.' 

Another era, which is current even now in Kashmir, is the Saptarsi era, also called Laukika era. According to the Rāja tarangins the Laukika year 24 was equal to saka 1070 (expired).10090 In the use of that era the centuries are generally omitted. It is a luni-solar era supposed to have begun in April 3076 B.C. on the first day of Caitra-śukla. Vide Cunningham's 'Indian eras' pp. 6–17 and Stein's Introduction to translation of the Rājatarangiņi pp. 58 ff.

Several other eras such as the Vardhamāṇa and Buddha nirvāņa eras, Gupta, Cedi, Harsa, Laksamaņa-sena ( in Bengal), Kollam or Paraśurāma era (prevelent in Malabar ), most of which were once in great vogue ( at least in civil life ) but are now practically unused, are passed over here, as of only academic interest in these days. For Vardhamāna nirvana era, vide I. A. vol. 25 p. 346 where the year 2493 after the nirvana of Vardha māna is said to be equal to Vikrama year 1888 and saka year 1752 (1830 A. D.) and Buddha-nirvana era in JRAS for 1875 at p. 358 ( a Ceylonese Inscription of Sāhasa-malla's time about 1191 A. D.), where mention is made that the king was crowned 1743 years, three months and 27 days after the nirrāna of Buddha. Great controversies have raged over the Gupta era (which Fleet holds began in 319 A. D.). There are some who hold that it is really the Vikrama era (J. I. H. vol. 17 p. 293 ff and J. I. H. special number of March and April 1941 pp. 71-84 ). For Harsa era, vide E. I. 19 p. 52 and Nos. 1385–1421 in Bhandarkar's list in vol. 20 Appendix of E. I. From Alberuni (Sachau vol. II, p. 5) it appears that Harsa era started in 606 A.D. There has been some connflict of views on this; vide ]HQ vol. 27 pp. 321 ff, vol. 28 p. 280 ff (by R.C. Majumdar) and vol. 29 pp. 72-79 (Dr. D. C. Sirkar). The Kollam era is said to have started in 1176 B. C. 

It has already been shown how in Vedic works the year was denoted by several synonyms such as samvatsara, samā, varsa. In the Nārada-samhitā 1011 it is said that there are nine kinds of

Timu (to be explained later) is a day of Brabmā (Sūryasiddhanta I, 20); one human year was supposed to be a day of the gods (T ET GOE OTTET TEHT: 1. T. III. 9, 22. 1); one human month was held to be the ahoratra of pitys (2. I, 66). Alguara is 

ETAYT (mixed) because men employ four reckonings (māna). for different purpo ses as stated in the IF.FeI.

But the f. ft. further on (I. 32) says that computations about planets are to be made by human reckoning (HETTE F1541 HER FAAC). 

Nine kinds of time reckonings 

657 

reckonings of time, viz. Brāhma ( of Brahmi), Daiva ( of the gods ), Mānusa (human ), pitrya ( of the Pitrs), Saura, Sāvana, Candra, Nāksatra and Barhaspatya, but that in ordinary wordly matters only five of these are employed. The Vedānga-jyotişa appears to refer to four when it says that in a yuga (of five years) there are 61 sāvana months, 62 lunar months, 67 nāksatra months, Hemādri ( on Kāla, p. 9) dwells on only three of these year reckonings, viz. cāndra, saura, and sāvana, while Madhava ( in Kālanirnaya-kārikās 11-12 ) speaks of two more, viz. Nāksatra and Bārhaspatya. The Vişnudharmottara speaks of four (not mentioning Bārhaspatya ). The three mentioned by Hemādri are those most employed in religious and civil matters, and dharmaśāstra works are specially concerned with them, while the other two are rarely referred to in the latter. A cāndra month 1012 is a time period from the end of one amāvāsyā (New Moon ) to the next amāyāsyā and twelve such months make the candra year of 354 days. It is also called a lunation. The length of a candra month varies from 29.246 to 29.817 days owing to the eccentri city of the moon's orbit and other causes and its average period is 29.53059 days. A saura month is the time taken by the sun to move through one sign of the zodiac; twelve such months con stitute the solar year, 1013 and the first day of a solar year is the

1013. The actşvulfag (which is in two recensions, attached to Řgveda and Yajurveda respectively) summarizes the several items of the saura year as follows :-त्रिशत्यहां सषदषष्टिरब्दः षट् चर्तवोयने। मासा द्वादश सौराः स्युरेतत्पश्चगुणं gril hargjutrag verse 31 (Sbam Shastri, ed.). The Vedānga-jyotisa holds that 366 days constitute a year. The modern Sūrya-siddhānta says that there are 365.258756 days in a year. The other siddbłotas slightly vary from this. According to modern astronomy the year consists of 365'242196 days. Vide 'Indian Culture' vol. VIII. pp. 114-116 for a note on this ( by N. C. Labiri) and Preface p. VIII, aod p. 240 of the (C. R. C.

first day of the Saura month, Mesa. If the entry of the sun in. to the sign is in the day time then that day is the first day of the month. If the entry is in the night, the next day is the first day of the month. The time of entry of the sun into a rāśi differs from almanac to almanac and the result is that the entry may be before sunset in one almanac and after sunset in another. Therefore, there may be the difference of one day as to the first day of the month. Owing to the adoption of different ayanām sas and the difference in the length of the year, the Dřk, Vākya and Siddhānta almanacs may differ about the first day of the year, about Pongal and other festivals. Sāyana year is of 12 months of 30 days each, the day being counted from one sunrise to the next. A nākşatra month is the time taken by the moon to pass through the 27 naksatras; the Bārhaspatya year is the time taken by Jupiter to pass through one sign of the zodiac (i. e. about 361 days). According to modern astronomy, Jupiter takes 11.86 years (for its revolution round the sun). All these four or five divisions are not mentioned in early works and even in later days all these four divisions do not appear to have been fully utilised, though mentioned in astronomical and dharmaśāstra works. Kautilya provides that 1014 the month for workmen is of thirty days and nights, the Saura month is one half day larger i, e. (30 days in a month ), the lunar month a half day legs (i. e. 291 days ), the nākṣatra month is of 27 days, the intercalary month is of 32 days (or occurs in the 32nd month? ), the month is of 35 days (for the wages) of those who tend horses and of 40 days for those who are keepers of elephants. The month for workmen was of 30 days, but it need not have coincided with Full Moon or New Moon, while lunar months end with amāvāsyā or pūrnimā. The Brāhmasphutasiddhānta quoted by Utpala on Bṛhat-samhita II. 4 p. 40 provides that from the saura reckoning one derives the extent of Yuga, the year, Vişuvat, Ayana, seasons, the increase and decrease in the length of the day and night; from the candra the details about tithis,

Vide Visnudharmottara I. 72.26-27 for similar verses. 

At present the year begins either in caitra or kārtika in different parts of India. But in ancient times it began in different months in different countries and for different purposes. Many Vedic 1015 passages show that the reckoning was pārņi. mānta, that the yoar began after the Full moon of Phālguna and that Vasanta was the first season of the year. It is due to this that Madhava says in his Kala-nirnaya p. 63 (Calcutta ed.) that Sruti (Veda ) is insistent on the pūrņimānta month (paūrņamāsyantatve śruteḥ katākso bhūyān). The Sm. C. (on śrāddha p. 377) notes that the amānta reckoning is followed in Deccan the (Dakşiņā-patha ) and pārņimānta in North India (Uttara-patha). Vide Mundakhede plate of Sendraka Jayasakti on 10th of Phālguna dark half of year 602 (must be sake) for indi cating that in north Mahārāştra there was amānta reckoning then (E. I. vol. 29 part V pp. 116-117). The Vedāngajyotişā 1016 says that the first year of the cycle of five years began in Magha śukla i. e. at the winter solstice. Alberuni ( Sachau II. pp. 8-9) 

mentions that the year began in Caitra, Bhadrapada, Kartika, Mārgaśīrsa in different parts of India. Kautilya 1017 provided that the year for work in the Government office of Accounts was a candra one and ended on the Full Moon of Āsādha. From Vanaparva 1018 it appears that the year began in Caitra. It is

possible to suggest that the year began with Mārgaśīrsa because Anušāsana (106. 17–30 ) deals with the results of practising ekabharla ira from Mārgaśīrsa to Kārtika. The Krtya ratnākara (p. 452 ) quoting Brahmapurāna says that the year began with the pruti,al of Mārgaśīrsa in Kṛtayuga. From Gītā X. 35 (māsınām mārgaśīrsoham) it does not, I humby think, follow that Mārgāśīrsa was the first month of the year, since most of the vibhūtis with which Lord Krsna identifies himself are the best in that particular category and as even among Pānda vas Arjuna is mentioned, not as first but as the best. Only a few such as akshara or Dvandva are the first of their respective categories. The Varsakriyā-kaumudi and Nirnayasindhu p.79 say that the Brahmapurāna1019 generally accepts the pūrnimānta recko ning and that it (N. S.) would deal with tithi-nirnaya by generally following Brāhmapurāņa. The Bhavisyapurāna when speaking of Holikā festival on Phālguna Full Moon states that it was the end of Phālguna (Uttara-parva 132. 1). Matsya 159.3-6 say that Skanda and Višākha are said to have been born on the 15th of dark half of caitra in a clump of reeds and it is added that the two were made into one by Indra on the 5th of the bright half of cajtra and on 6th crowned as commander. It follows that Matsya thinks the month to have been pūrnimānta. 

Something must be said about the 60 year cycle called Bārhaspatya (Jovian). The Visnu-dharmottara 1020 says that the first year called Prabhava of the sixty year cycle began on Māghaśukla when the sun and the moon occupied the nakşatra Dhanisthā and were in conjunction with Jupiter. In Bṛhat samhitā 8. 27-52 the phalas of the 60 years from Prabhava to Ksaya are described, as also in Agnipurāpa chap. 139, while the Visnudharmottara I. 82. 9 ff and Bhavisya quoted in Jyotistattva pp. 692–697 enumerate all the 60 by name with their phalas. Each year of the Bārhaspatya cycle has the word 'Samvatsara' added to it. As yuga means five years, the sixty samvatsaras of Jupiter are twelve times five and are so described in Br. S. 8. 23-26 and in Visnudharmottara I. 92. 9 and later writers suppose that the samvatsaras are affiliated to the lunar

year alone 1021. In the Deccan now (and in older times also ) it appears that at the beginning of each year the Jovian name is changed. But in northern India Vijaya is the first year instead of Prabhava. The length of Jupiter's year is 361. 9267 days and is shorter than the sidereal year by 4.23 days. The result is that in 85 sidereal years there are 83 Jovian (or samvatsara ) years and therefore there is the suppression (kşaya) of one year after 85 years (which is done only in Northern India). 

The Jovian cycle must be an ancient one; some Purāņas and Varāhamihira speak of it as an established institution. Vide Cunningham's 'eras' pp. 11-25 (60 year cycle) and pp. 26-30 (12 year cycle ), Warren's 'Kālasankalita'( pp. 199-216), V. B. Ketkar's work on Indian and foreign chronology' pp. 73-82, I. A. vol. 18 pp. 193–209 (Kielhorn) and pp. 221-224 ( Fleet) and Gupta Inscriptions, Introduction pp. 169-176 ( a note on 12 year cycle and 60 year cycle of Jupiter by Sh. B. Dikshit) for origin and information about the Bārbaspatya cycle and tables, In Malabar and Travancore the Jovian cycle is of twelve years, but it is passed over here for reasons of space.

History of Dharmaśāsira (Sec. II, Ch. XVIII 

The names of the Bārhaspatya years occur rather early in Inscriptions. Among the earliest references are two, one to Siddhartha-samvatsara in the 5th year of the reign of the Cālukya king Margalesa ( I. A. 19 p. 1 ff at p. 18 ) and the other is to Saumya-samvatsara in the Alas plate of Rāstrakūta king Govinda in sake 692 ( E. I. vol. VI p. 209). How the samvatsara names were supposed to indicate different consequences for the years concerned can be illustrated by citing two verses from the Bṛhatsamhitā ( 8. 28–29 )' when the samvatsara Prabhava starts there are drought, strong winds and destruction by fire and also other calamities (like excessive rain, locusts &c.); there are diseases due to phlegm, but still people are not distressed.' The consequences in the next four samvatsaras are auspicious, viz. the king rules over a kingdom which is full of paddy, sugarcane and barley and other crops, which is free from dangers, in which there are no hatreds, in which the people are joyous and free from the evil results of kaliyuga (such as adharma, poverty, accidental deaths &c.). 

The subject of months is one of the most complicated. Indians followed the luni-solar calendar from very ancient times like the Babylonians, Chaldeans, Jews and the Chinese. All had therefore to resort to the device of intercalary months ( adhika-māsa or malamāsa). But Indians had rarely a ksaya month also which is absent in the systems of the other peoples. This difference arose owing to the different ways of the calcula tions of the motions and positions of the sun and moon, in which I do not propose to enter for reasons already stated. But a few words to indicato how an additional month arises may be said here. The solar year exceeds the lunar year by a little ayer eleven tithis. This excess amounts to one lunar month in about 32 solar months. The Babylonians had a cycle of 19 solar years in which there were 7 intercalary months (i. e, in all 235 lunar months.) The same cycle was called Metonic cycle after Meton, an Athenian, who introduced it in Greece. This cycle is the foundation of the Jewish and Christian calendars, especi ally so far as Easter is concerned. From the Vedānga-Jyotişa 1022 it appears that in a cycle of five years there were two intercalary

months, one being a 2nd Āsādha at the end of 21 years and the other a second Pausa at the end of the yuga of five years. Kautilya's Arthasastra merely echoes this. The Pitamaha siddhānta provided that an intercalary month was to be added after thirty months. 1023 In the Virātaparva 1024 it is said that the period of 13 years ( 12 years in exile and one year incognito ) was more than completed by the Pāņdavas if the cāndra recko ning were followed, as two months were to be added in five years. The purānas and other works give varying periods after which an intercalary month occurs. A few examples may be cited. Visnudharmottara 1025_states that the solar year has eleven days more than the lunar one and that after two years eight months, sixteen days and four ghatis a month has to be added. This is not to be taken literally, otherwise it would have to be held that after four ghatikās on 2nd tithi of the dark half of a month an intercalary month has to be added. All that the passage of the Purāna does is to indicate the number of days in the lunar reckoning after which an additional month is possible. Similarly, a passage of the Kathakagrhya 1026 says that in the lunar month in which there is no sankrānti or there are two sankrāntis a month is added after thirty months have ex pired from a previous intercalary month. This too indicates only a possibility and not a certainty. The Nirnayāmrta 1027 declared that a month is added between thirty and thirtysix months. This too is only approximate. A more definite rule is that the lunar month in which no sankranti occurs is called adhika ( intercalary ) and bears the same name as that of the

next lunar month which is called suhihu or nija or prākrta to distinguish it from the intercalary month or if in one solar month two amāvāsyās 1028 and then there is an adhikamāsa or malamāsa. That lunar month in which two sankrantis occur gets two names of which the first is retained and the second is suppressed (i. e. this second becomes a haiya māsa). This means that a kşaya māsa occurs when there are two sankrāntis in a month. That lunar month in which the sun entors Moşa sign is called Caitra, that in which he enters Vrsabha is called Vaisakha and so on. 1029 

One or two points more about adhika and kşaya months may be mentioned. The seven months from Phalguna to Aśvina can become only a thika but never kstyl. Kārtika and Mārgaśīrsa may become both Adhika and Ksaya, but rarely; Māgha can become adhika but it has never been adhika or ksaya (vide Ketkar's work p. 40 ). But the Suddhikaumudi says that Māgha was a ksaya month in sako 1397; 1030 and the Malamāsatattva quotes a text to the effect that Māgha may be an intercalary month, but Pausa never, About Pausa, Mr. V. B. Ketkar (in 'Indian and foreign chronology' p. 40) says that Pausa has almost no chance of becoming adhika, but has greater chance of becoming kşaya than Margasirsa' ( but see a little below ). A ksaya month is generally preceded and followed, though not immediately, by an adhika month, so that there are two adhika months when a ksaya month occurs in some years. The Siddhānta-širomani states that one out of the three months only viz. Kārtika, Mārgasirşa and Pauşa can be kşayamāsa and that when a kşaya

māsa occurs there is an adhikamāsa before and after it within three months (Grahaganita, Madhyamādhikāra, verse 6. explanation). The curious reader may consult pp. 246-251 of the C. R. C. Report for light on the intercalary months. The Siddhānta-širomani 1031 mentions some saka years in which kşaya-māsa occurred or would occur, viz. in saka year 974 (expired) occurred a ksaya month and a kşaya month will occur in saka 1115, saka 1256, saka 1378 and a kşaya month generally occurs after 141 years and rarely in 19 years. In No. 1387 in the list of Inscriptions by D. R. Bhandarkar there is a reference to the 2nd tithi of the bright half of the first 1032 Pausa ( dated samvat 34, probably of Harsa era); for a reference to 2nd Āsādha see Sohawal plate of Sarvanātha in year 191 (probably Gupta) in E, I. vol. 19 at p. 130: for 2nd Pausa Jesar plate of Silāditya in 357 Valabhi era in E. I. vol. 22 p. 120 may be seen. 

The rules about what religious acts should be done or not done in an intercalary month will be dealt with a little later. The Sāntiparya refers to the kşaya of samvatsaras, months, paksas and divasas (tithis )1033. When there is a ksayamāsa, the adhikamāsa before it is like all ordinary māsas i. e. there is no prohibition of doing religious acts in it, but the adhikamāsa that follows a kşayamāsa is the one that is declared unsuitable for religious rites. Adhikamāsa and kşayamāsa may be illustrated by one example for each. Suppose that there was Mesa sankrānti on Caitra amāvāsyā, that from the first tithi following the amāvāsyā to the next amāvāsyā (which is Vaišākha) there

is no sankrānti and then Vrsabha sankrānti occurs on the 1st tithi thereafter; the month that had no sankrānti would be adhika Vaišākha and the month on which Vrsabha sankrānti takes place would be the suddha ( proper ) Vaišākha. Non as to kşaya māsa; suppose that there is Kanyā sankrānti on Bhādra pada amāvāsyā, then there is adhika Āśvina followed by Suddha Āśvina, on the first tithi of which there is Tula sankrānti, then on Kārtika-sukla 1st there is Vrścika sankrānti, then on Mārgaśīrşa-sukla pratipad there is Dhanus sankranti and in the same month on amāyāsyā there is Makara sankranti, Then that month having two sankrāntis (Dhanus and Makara ) would be called kşayamāsa and so there would be one month Pausa (constituted by two months, Margaśīrsa and Pausa ). Then on Māgha amāvāsyā there is Kumbha sankrānti, then Phālguna would be adhika māsa and there would be Mina sankranti on suddha Phālguna-śukla pratipad. Thus in the year in which there is a kşayamāsa, there are still 13 months and the days of the year amount to some days less then 390. 

The four kinds of months, Candra, Saura, Sāvana and Nākşatra 1034 have already been described (p. 657) when speaking of the Cāndra and other years. As observed by the Krtyaratnā kara (p. 80 ) the nāksatra month is not required in Dharma Šāstra, but is known only in Jyotisa-sastra. Pañcāngas are generally prepared for each year. They contain separate 1034a pages for the two pakşas (fortnights ) of each of the twelve months (or 13 months if there be an intercalary month). The five important parts of the Indian calendar are 1035 tithi, week day, naksatra, yoga and karaņa. The Muhurtadarśana 1036 says that 

1034. मासास्तु सावनः सौरश्चान्द्रो नाक्षत्र इत्यपि। दर्शान्तः पूर्णिमान्तो वा चान्द्रोऽसौ faasteit: 1 Hra 17: Here sunan STT: Il filmhurraient 16-17; आयुर्दायादावपरो नाक्षत्र इत्यर्थः । 

1034a. The accompanying printed page is from the reformed calendar prepared according to the Karanakalpalatā and used by some people in Mahārāstra. It may be compared witb an extract of one fortnight from a paṛcāöga 223 years earlier than the one for sake 1878. It will be found that the fundamental contents are the same in both.

it may have six parts if the signs of the zodiac are given and seven if the positions of the planets are mentioned. Vāra ( weekday ) is the period of time between one sunrise and the next and not much will have to be said about it except about the origin of week days. A great deal has already been said about tithis and naksatras. What remains to be said about these, if at all, and the treatment of Yoga and Karaṇa will be dealt with later on. We must revert to the topic of nakşatras. 

The names of the twelve solar months distributed two each among six seasons are very ancient, They occur in the Taittirīya-samhitā IV. 3. 11. 1, Vāj. S. 13. 25. They are Madhu, Madhava, Sukra, Suci, Nabhas, Nabhasya, Isa, Urja, Sabas, Sahasya, Tapas and Tapasya 1037. In the Brāhmaṇas we meet with months (lunar) named from naksatras It is therefore that some works speak of rtus (seasons ) as of two kinds, viz. Saura and Cāndra. The former begin eithor with Minarāśi or Mesa rāši, while the latter are called Caitra and the rest.1038 The name of the nakşatra is often formed into a derivative and joined to the word Paurņamāsi, Pūrņamāsa or Amāvāsyā and sometimes the names of the months such as Phālguna and Caitra occur in the Brāhmaṇas ( vide note 1015 above ).1039 

Pāṇini derives the names of the months like Caitra from Paurņamāsi and expressly names the Āgrahāyaṇi (IV. 2. 22 ), Phālguni, Sravanā, Kārtiki and Caitri (IV. 2.23). 'Paurnamāsi' itself is derived from Pūrņamāsa by the Vārtika 2 on Pāṇini IV. 2. 35. The Full Moon tithi which has Pusya naksatra is called Pauşi by the sūtras (Pān. IV. %. 3 and IV. 2. 21). Thus there were three stages; first the 27 naksatras were distinguished and named in the very ancient Vedic samhitās, then the Full Moon day was called Caitri Paurņamāsi (and so on) because on that tithi the Moon was in Citrā nakşatra and so on; then 

1037. ATM (chap, 50, verse 202 ) enumerates these twelve months. The grbyasūtras employ the saura montb pames; vide p. 610 above about the months for marriage. They occur in inscriptions also as the month 

Sahasya' and • Tapasya' in the Mandasor Inscription of 493 and 529 of the Mālava era (Gupta Inscriptions p. 79 ff).

History of Dharmaśāstra (Sec. II, Ch. XVIII 

the months were called Caitra, Vaišākha &c. because they had Caitri or Vaišākhi Paurņamāsī in it. All this occurred long before Pāṇini. Later the saura names Madhu, Madhava &c. came to be identified with lunar months Caitra, Vaišākha &c. and became synonyms. When this occurred it is difficult to say. But it is much older than the Christian era. It must be long before Kālidīsa, who in his Meghadūta first speaks of. Āsādha and then refers to the next month Srāvana as Nabhas. Often on the Full Moon day the Moon might not actually be in or very near Citrā or Sravana naksatra but that did not matter; the month would still be called Caitra or Srāvana as the case may be. 1040 

It has already been shown that in ancient Brāhmaṇa times the months ended with the Full Moon (i. e. were pūrnimānta ). When foreigners like Kaniska and Huviska ruled over Northern India they stuck to the Pūrṇimānta Indian months in their records, though here and there they employ Macedonian month names. For example, the Greek month Gurppiya is used in Huviska's reign ( 28th year) in the Mathura Brāhmi Inscription and the Greek month 1041 Artemisios also occurs. In the Zoda Inscription the month must be held to be pūrnimānta as the naksatra Uttarāphalguni is there said to have occurred on the 20th day of Āşādha. 1042 The Tekkali plates of Devendravarman record a grant on the occasion of a lunar eclipse on the 30th day of Māgha. 1043 Similarly, in the Lodhia plates of Sivagupta ____1040. मेषादिस्थे सवितरि यो यो दर्शः प्रवर्तते । चान्दमासास्तत्तदन्ताश्चैत्राद्या द्वादश स्मृताः॥ तेषु या या पौर्णमासी सा सा चैव्यादिका स्मृता । कादाचित्केन योगेन नक्षत्रस्येति aufg: Il q. by ETC on STIHTĀ 16.1, who explains a HEF Faft an अमावास्या तदन्ते चान्द्रमसे मासि पौर्णमासी सा श्रवणा श्रावणीति चोच्यते। श्रवणयोगस्त WEÇ AT AT 11.

Pūrņimanta months 

669 

Bālārjuna of Kośala ( i. e. Chhattisgarh region ) published in E. I. vol. 27 p. 319 the date 'Sambatsare sapta pañcāśattame Kārtika pornamāsyām ankena samvat 57, Kārtika dina 30' (p. 325 ) shows that the month was pārņimānta. The Rājatarangisi 1044 says that king Harirāja came to the throne at the beginning of Āsādha in the 4th year of the Laukika era), who ruled only for twenty-two days and died on 8th of the bright half of Suci (i.e Āsādha) and thereby shows that the month was pārņimānta in Kashmir then as now. 

Though inscriptions before the Christian era raraly mentioned the names of months (such as Kārtika 14th in the Kharosthi Inscription of the Greek king Menander, 1045 2nd century B. C.), the usual mode is to mention the stu (season), then the number of the month (and not name ) in the season and then divasa, e. g. vide the seven inscriptions from 1046 Mathurā and the Sarnath Inscription of Mahārāja Kaniska. 1047 In some inscriptions only the rtu ( season), the number of the paksa and the day occur; vide Nāgārjunikonda 1043 Ins. (3rd century A. D.), the Omgudu grant of Vijayaskandavarman (E. I. 15 p. 252 * Hemantapakse totiye trayodasyām'), the Nāga image Ins. of Kaniska's time ( E. I. 17 p. 11 ) in sa.

Sometimes the month is mentioned but no paksa and the days are counted continuously from 1 to 30 e. g. Khoh plates of Mahārāja Jayanātha (in year 177 and 22nd day of Caitra ) and Khoh plate of Sarvanātha in year 193 month Caitra day 10th without the mention of the fortnight (vide Gupta Inscriptions pp. 121 and 125), E.

D.) Māgha śu. 20. It may be noted that here the month is pūrnimānta. In modern times people use such abbreviations as su di or va di or vadya. The first is abridged from śukla dine (or divaca) or świldha lina and the latter from bihula-linı or divasa ( ra and ba being often interchangeable). For 'balıula', vide E. I. vol. 16, p. 236 at p. 238 ( inscription of Rudrasena in the year 127 held to be of the saka era ), Rudradāman's Junagadh inscription in the year 72 ( 150 A. D.) of Mārgasirsa, bahula-pratipad (Lūder's list No. 965 and E. I. vol. VIII. p. 36 at p. 40), Udayagiri cave inscription in Gupta era 106 (425-26 A. D.) 'bahuladine' (Gupta inscriptions p. 258). For śukla, vide Gupta Inscriptions pp. 95, 102, 114 and for surddha, vide the Nasik cave inscription in the year 42 of the reign of Usavadāta, son-in-law of Naha pāna, where we have ' Kātikasudhe' (in E. I. VIII at p. 82 ) and Pardi plates of Dahrasena in Kalacuri year 207 (i. e. 455-56 A. D.) in C. I. I. vol. IV pp. 22, 24 ( Vaišākha-suddha-trayo daśyām); for su di, vide E. I. 17 p. 110 ( of the Valabhi year 106, 525–26 A. D.). For 'ba di' vide JBBRAS (New Series ) vol. I. p. 66 ‘Bhādrapada ba 13' in Valabhi year 210 and E. I. 19 p. 126 plate of Dhruvasena (in Valabhi year 210 Bhadra pada ba di 9). It may be noted that 'sudi' and 'vadi' are treated as indeclinables (aryaya) and included in the 'svarā digana' ('svarādinipātamavyayam' Pān. I. 1. 37) by later gram matical writers. The Kāśikā, however, does not include these two in the 'svarādi-gana' which is an ākrtigana and therefore liable to be added to. 'Vadya' is inexplicable except as an attempt to have some word with some assonance of sound parallel to śuddha and related to 'va di'. It is not clear why the word 'paksa' is not used in many inscriptions before and after the Christian era even though the word pakşı occurs in such ancient works as the Brāhmaṇas 1019 and Upanişads. The Chāndogya-Upanjşad (IV. 15. 5 and V. 10. 1), the Bșhad āraṇyaka-Upanişad VI. 2. 15-16 employ the words 'āpūrya māņa-paksa' (also pūrvapaksa' and 'aparapaksa' in Bṛ Up.

III. 1. 5) and 'apaksiyamānapaksa ' ( and also ' aparapaksa' for 'bahula' or 'krsna'). Panini derives the word 'paksati' (meaning the first tithi of a paksa) from the word 'paksa.' (V. 2.35 'paksat-tih'). 

In South India months are known by the rāśi names (such as Mina-masa, Mesa-masa). That practice prevailed in the Pandya country long ago. Vide E. I. vol. 25 p. 35 where a solar eclipse is said to have occurred in the month of Mithuna in the 12th year of a Pandya king ( about 959 A. D.) 

The intercalary month is called adhimāsa, malamāsa, malim luca, samsarpa, amhaspati or amhasaspati, purusottamamasa. These words require some brief explanation. In the first place, it may be noted that from very ancient times the 13th month was condemned. For example, the Ait. Br. says that the gods purchased soma plant from the 13th month and that one who sells soma plant is sinful, that the 13th month does not exist as a favourable period. 105) In Tai. S. the 13th month is called 

samsarpa' and 'amhaspati' (1. 4. 14. 1 and VI, 5. 3. 4). 'Amhas' means 'sin' in the Rgveda. Vide H. of Dh, vol. IV. p. 6. It is called adhimāsa because it is an 1051 additional (adhika) month. It is named malamāsa because this month is as it were the dirt or refuse of time. 1052 The word malimluca is found in the Atharvaveda VIII, 6.2 but its meaning is doubtful. It is also found in the Kāthakasamhita. In later literature ' malimluca' means 1053 'a thief'. In Rgveda x. 136.2 ('munayo vātaraśanāḥ pisangā vasate mala', sages sons of Vātaraśana, cover themselves with brown dirty clothes ), the word mala

appears to mean soiled or dirty clothes! The word 'malimluca' occurs in Vāj. S. 22. 30, Sankhāyana-srautasūtra VI. 12. 15. The Malamāsatattva derives the word as follows: "being mali ( soiled) it passes on'. The words 'samsarpa' and 'amhasaspati' occur in Vāj. S. 22. 30 and 31 1054 respectively, and 'ambasa spati' in Vāj. S. 7. 31 after the mantras referring to the twelve saura months, Madhu, Mādhava &c. The Tai. S. (I. 4. 14. 1 and VI. 5. 3. 4) has the formula 'samsarposyaham-spataye tvā1055 *Amhaspati' literally means 'the lord of sins or evil' (i. e. a condemned month ). Later medieval writers inake a distinction 1056 between samsarpa' and 'amhaspati'. When there are in one year two adhimāsas and a kşayja māsa, the first of the two adhimāsas is called 'samsarpa' and it is not condemned for all religious matters but only for marriages, such sacrifices as Agnistoma, festivals ( that are not obligatory) and auspicious rites of children ( such as 'nāmakarana'). The name amhaspati is confined to kşayamūsı. The intercalary month is called Puruşottama-māsa (Visņu being called Purusottama) in some of the Purānas as in Padma VI. 64, probably with the purpose of reducing the opprobrium that attached to an intercalary month. 

In the Dharmaśāstra Literature considerable space is devoted to the intercalary month e. g. in the Agnipurāņa 175. 29-30, the Rājamārtanda (folios 68a-69, verses 1078-1115), Kālaviveka of Jimātavāhana pp. 113--168, Hemādri on Kāla pp. 26-66, Kālanirnaya of Madhava, Madanapārijāta pp. 544-550, Suddhikaumudi pp. 265-296, Malamāsatattva (Jivananda ed.) pp. 736-856, Samayaprakāśa pp. 140-155 (part of Viramitrodaya), Nirnayasindhu pp. 9–17, Smrtikaustublia (samvatsaradīdhiti) pp. 520-529, Dharmasindhu pp. 4-7, Puruşārthacintāmaņi pp. 17–31.

673 

The Agnipurāņa provides : 1057 one should avoid in an inter calary month the performance of the following acts, viz. of consecration of Vedic fires, the establishment of images, sacrifices, religious gifts, vratas, the recitation of the Veda after under taking it, observance of certain ntyamas guch as mahānāmpi, the letting loose of a bull (after sapiņdana), tonsure of a child, upanayana, rites such as the samskāras of nāmakarana, in auguration of a king Long lists of what may or may not be done in an intercalary month occur in many works such as in Hemadri on Kāla pp. 36-66, Nirnayasindhu pp. 10–15, Dharma sindhu pp. 57. It would be enough if some general provisions are stated. The gereral 1058 rule is that one should perform obligatory acts and acts prescribed on certain occasions even in an intercalary month. For example, one must perform even in an intercalary month daily sandhyî worship, the five daily Mahāyajñas (such as Brahmayajña, Vaišvadeva), the offering into fire (as an agnihotrin) and must take a bath if there is an eclipse (in adhimāsa), although this is nainettika; so also one must perform the funerary rites after a relative's death even if the death takes place in an adhimāsa (this also is nnimiltika). But an obligatory rite should not be performed in adhimāsa if śāstra allows its postponement, e. g. Soma sacrifice. The general rule is that no kāmya rite (not obligatory, but to be performed for securing some object or result) is to be performed in adhimāsa. There are exceptions to this also if a certain religious rite is begun before an adhimāsa falls (such as a Prājāpatya penance for twelve days or a cāndrāyaṇa penance for a month) it may be continued even in adhimāsa. If there is drought and one desires to perform the Kariri iştı, for bringing down rain, this may be done even in adhimāsa, since to vait might defeat the

Certain matters were to be done only in malamāsa such as the gift 1660 of 33 apūpas (cakes) every day to brāhmaṇas or at least once in the intercalary month; certain acts were not to be done in adhimāsa, but only in the suddha 1c5da month, such as the sinking of wells, construction of tanks, solemn sacrifices, the mahādānas and vratas. Certain matters can be done in adhimasa as well as in suddha-masa 1661 e.g. rites on a pregnancy ( such as pumsavana), taking interest on money lent, wages of workmen for fixed periods, monthly śrāddha i on amāvāsyā), daily gifts, bath at a holy place, japa (muttering mantras), homa with barley grains or rice or sesame, rites on the birth of a child, funeral rites, nire-śrāddhas, śrāddha on 13th tithi with Magha-naksatra, the sixteen śrādduas, bath and śrāddha and gifts and japa on lunar or solar eclipse, obligatory and naimittika acts; these may be done in malamāsa also.

Just as the 13th month was to be discarded for religious rites, in Western countries number 13 is supposed to be unlucky, particularly in the case of company at a table. 

One of the five angas in the Indian pañcāngas is the week day. A brief discussion on days and week-days has therefore to be held. The interval between two sunrises was considered as the most important unit of time. This is solar and is called the civil day. But tuthi is a lunar division of time ( as described above) and begins and ends at various spaces in the solar day. The word 'day' has two meanings, viz. (1) from sunrise to sunset and (2) from sunrise to sunrise. 1062 In Rg. the word 'ahah' is applied to both the dark part of it (i. e. 'rātri' night) and to the bright part. 1063 The word rātri is not so frequently used in the Rgveda as the word 'ahan' and the word 'dina' is very frequently used in compounds like 

gudinatva', 'sudina' 'madhyandina'; 'ahoratra' ( day and night) occurs only once in the Rg. X. 190.2. The word 'pūryābpa' (first part of the day or forenoon) occurs in the Rgveda X. 34. 11. Three parts of the day also occur in the Rgveda viz prātaḥ, sangava and madhyandina 1064 (mid-day ). These are three out of the five parts of the day, the other two being aparāhna and astamaya, astagamana or sāyāhna, which five are mentioned in the Satapatha Br. II.3.2.9. Both 'prātab' (morning ) and 'sāyam' (evening) occur in Rg. V. 77.2 and * sāyam' alone in Rg. VIII. 2. 20, X. 146.3 and 40. The day and night were also divided into eight parts by Kautilya (I. 19) and by Daksa and Kātyāyana. The division of the day and night each into 15 muhūrtas has been already dealt with at some longth on pp. 537-541. 

Great divergence prevailed about the beginning of the day. The Jews placed the beginning of the civil day in the evening (vide Genesis I. 5 .The evening and the morning were the first day' and also I. 13.) The Egyptians divided the day from sunrise to 

1062. Vide H. of Dh, vol. II. pp. 644-45, vol. III. p. 242 and vol. IV. pp. 376-377 for the different ways of dividing the day.

sunset into twelve parts and thus obtained hours whose length depended on the season, while the Babylonians 1065 began the day with sunrise and divided day and night into twelve parts, each of which corresponded to two of the equinoctial hours. In Athens and in Greece generally the day commenced in historic times with the evening for the purposes of the calendar/vide Heath's 'Aristarchus of Samos', 1913, p. 281). In Rome the day began with midnight. With Indian writers the day begins with sun rise (as in Brāhmasphuta-siddhānta XI. 33), but they were not unaware of different beginnings of the day. The Panca siddhāntikā 1066 remarks that Aryabhata declared that the day began at midnight in Lanka and again he said that it began with sunrise and that sunrise in Lankā coincides with sunset in Siddhapura, with mid-day in Yamakoți and with midnight in the Romaka country. 

In modern times the civil day begins at midnight. 

The seven day week is an artificial man-made arrangement. It corresponds to no astronomical or celestial phenomenon. The Mexicans had a week of five days 1067 before the Spanish conquest. The seven days week prevailed among Jews, Babylonians and the Incas of South America. The Romans had a week of eight days in Republican times, while the Egyptians and ancient Athenians had a week of ten days. In the Old testament God is said to have gone on with the work of creation for six days, to have rested on the seventh and to have blessed it and sanctified 

1065. Hastings in E.R.E. vol. XII. p. 50 says so; but Prof Neugebauer in E, S A, p. 101 says that Babylonian day began in the evening and the first day of the month was made to depend upon a datural phenomenon, namely, the visible crescent of the Moon Fotheringham in his Explana tions to Nautical Almanac 1935 (at p. 769) states that the Babylonians reckoned day from midnight and mentions Plioy as saying that Hipparchus also did the same.

it (Genesis 2. 1-3). In Exodus 20. 8-11, 23. 12-14 and Deutero. nomy 5. 12-15 God is said to have commanded the Jews to labour for six days, take rest on the seventh and to observe it as the Sabbath of the Lord God and to keep it sacred. The Jews gave no specil nimes to the week days except the Sabbith which was the last day of the week and which they observed on Saturd y (and not on Sunday). 

The Old Testament contains no traces of proper n mes having been given to week days. It appers that even in the New Testament week days were indicated by numbers. Vide Matthew 28. 1 'In the end of the sabbath as it began to dawn towards the first day of the we:k came mary Magdalen &c. '; Mark 16. 9. Now when Jesus wus risan liirly the first dull of the week he appeared first to Mary Magdalen &c.'; Luke 24. 1 ' Nord upon the first day of the week being early in the morning they came into the sepulchre'. Each of the seven days of the week is designated as the sabbath or holy day by various nationalities and religious communities i. e. Monday is the Greek Sabbath, Tuesday the Persian, Wednesday the Assyrian, Thursday the Egyptian, Friday the Moslem, Saturday the Jewish and Sunday the Christian. 

On the origin and development of the seven-day cycle the leading work is F. H. Colson's 'the week' (Cambridge University Press, 1926 ). Some of his arguments may be briefly indicated. Dion Cassius (first quarter of 3rd century A.D.) in bis 37th book says that Jerusalem was captured 1067a by Pompey in 63 B. C. owing to the reverence of the Jews for Saturday (their Sabbath day) and he further makes the statements that planetary week originated in Egypt, that it wūs of rocent growth and that it was in general use in his Jay; vide Dio's ‘Roman History' vol. III pp. 129, 131 where iwo traditional explanations are given as to how the week days were named after planets, the 2nd of which is based on the 24 hours of the day and night. What must be emphasized is that Dio is positive that week days did not originate in Greece, but in Egypt and their introduction was recent. Dio was a Roman and wrote his History between 200 to 222 A. D. Therefore, the introduction of week days in Greece could not have been earlier than the first century of the 

1067 a. Vide Dio's 'Roman History' (Loeb 'Classical Library) vol. III pp. 126-127 where it is said that Pompey captured the Jewesb defenders of Palesiine on the day of Sabbath, because they did not work on that day at all,

Christian era. The names of six week days as we find them now have been found scrawled on a wall in the city of Pompeii which was engulfed in lava in 79 A. D. This points to the fact that present weekday names were known in Italy before 79 A. D. Colson finds it difficult to explain how the planetary week got ascendancy in the Roman Empire, since there is complete silence as to official enforcement of the week among Romans or even as to the recognition of the planetary week. He is perplexed by the week day names among the Teutonic nations such as Wednesday and Thursday. Sarton ( in a 'History of Science') thinks that the Jewish Sabbath, the story of creation with Egyptian hours and Chaldean astrology produced the present week (pp. 76-77). Sarton thus thinks that Greece had nothing to do with the introduction of the planetary week, but only Egypt and Babylon developed it. The modern European hours are derived from the Babylonian nychthemeron for their equality and from the Egyptian Calendar for their number. Sarton remarks that the gradual spread of the seven day week throughout the world is the most remarkable instance of cultural diffusion next to the decimal notation system, since it was planned or enforced by nobody. As shown above the continuous seven day week with specific names for the days was unknown to the New Testament, which does not name the day of Christ's Crucifixion or Ascension. It is difficult to point out any certain piece of evidence which can establish that the names and arrangement of the present week days were prevalent in Greece or any other European or Near East country before the 2nd century B. C. Ptolemy in his Tetrabiblos does not appear to make any astrological use of the week days. The present order of week days appears to be planetary, but if we look to the mere Dames the planets are arranged as Sun, Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus and Saturn. Ravivāra is the first day in the week for various reasons, one of which is that creation is believed to have begun on that day (vide note 995a). That order apparently takes no account of the distance of the planets or of their mass, light or importance. Yāj. I. 295 arranges the nine grahas as the Sun, the Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, Saturn, Rāhu and Ketu. The Visnupurāņa (I. 12. 92 ) has the same order. The Vāyupurāpa says that the Sun is beyond one lakh of yojanas from the earth and the moon is beyond the sun by a thousand yojanas, the naksatras are 100000 yojanas beyond the Moon and each of the other planets are beyond the naksatras, the order being Mercury, Venus, Mars, 

Planets and week days 

679 

Jupiter and Saturn, each succeeding one being beyond each preceding one. If the planets be arranged in the order of distance from the earth they would stand as Saturn ( the most distant planet for ancient times), Jupiter, Mars, Sun, Venus, Mercury, Moon. The same 1068 order is set out in the Arya bhatīya. Suppose we start from Saturn, then the 4th from it (but including it) would be the Sun and therefore Saturday is followed by Sunday. If we start from the Sun, then the 4th from it, would be the Moon and so Monday is the weekday after Sunday and this may be further carried on. It is argued that the order of week days was suggested by the Egyptian system of 34 parts for the day, each part being ruled by one planet in order. On Sunday, the first part is ruled by the Sun and after 21 parts the 22nd is again ruled by the Sun, 23rd by Venus, 24th by Mercury and the next day ( 25th hour) would be Monday. If this arrange. ment of weekdays is due to the system of 24 hours and rulers of hours, the same order can be arrived at but only in the reverse way if, instead of 24 parts, the day is divided into 60 parts (the ghatikās). Suppose if we begin with the Moon, each ghati being assigned to one planet, 57th would be the Moon's, 58th Mercury's, 59th of Venus, 60th of the Sun and so the next day after Monday would be Tuesday. 

It appears that the continuous seven day week did not form part of the religious life of any nation in antiquity and even now it is no part of the religious life of many peoples. Great controversies have raged round the origin and spread of week. days. It is said by many scholars that the Indian weekdays are not indigenous, but have been borrowed from the Chaldeans or the Greeks.1069 An effort will first be made to present the Indian literary and inscriptional evidence to indicate how far backwards the occurrence of the weekdays in India can be carried. The oldest inscriptional evidence so far available is that of the Eran stone Pillar Inscription of Budhagupta in the

1069. Fleet in JRAS for 1912 p. 1039 suggests that the Jewish Calendar of week days found its way into lodia after Europe received it i, e, in 3rd century A.D. Jayaswal (in I. A, vol. 47 p. 112 ) says that if week. days were received from outside India, it must have beea from Syria direct and not via Europe. Dikshit in his monumental work appears to hold that India received weekdays from the Cbaldeans.

Gupta year?'70 165 (i. 0. A. D. 481), which meations Thursday and the 12th tithi of the bright half of Āsādha. Supposing for argument that weekdays were originally borrowed from some foreign country, at least a few hundred years would be necessary before such a borrowed system could become general and could be utilized even in Indian proclamations by a great Indian imperial dynasty like the Guptas. 

Let us now turn to the literary evidence. The Aryabhatīya ( Dasagitikā, verse 3) mentions Thursday, 1071 In Brhat samhitā 107. occurs this 'when Pitāmaha declared that the week day Tuesday does not lead to auspicious results or when (I declare ) that the day of the son of the earth is inauspicious, what difference is there between (the śāstra ) composed by a divine author and that by a human author (like myself )?' It has been seen above ( p.458 ) that the Pañsasiddhāntikā tells us that a five year cycle started according to Pitamaha in the second year (expired) of the Saka era. Therefore it appears that Pitāmaha who probably wrote about 80 A. D mentioned Tuesday. The Pañcasiddhāntikā (in I. 8) mentions Monday in summarising the features of the Romaka siddhānta (vide note 1004). The Brhatsamhita in chapter 103 (verses 61-63) sets out what actions are proper to be done on the weekdays from Sunday to Saturday and Utpala quotes eighteon Anustubh verses in all from the ancient astronomer Garga on the same topic.1072a Kern

assigns Garga to the 1st Century B. C. This would carry the knowledge of weekdays in India to the first century before Christ. Philostratus in his life of Apollonius of Tyana ( who died in 98 A. D.) relates (vide note 900 above ) how when Apollonius travelled in India he received from Iarchus, the chief of the brāhmaṇas, seven rings bearing names of seven planets, each one of which Apollonius was to wear on each of the week days. As Philostratus wrote in the first quarter of the 3rd century A. D., this would carry the knowledge of the planetary week in India at least to the 1st century of the Christian era. The above references furnish a terminus ad quem for India's knowledge of the planetary week days (viz. first century B. C. to first century A D.). The terminius a quo cannot be stated with certainty. 

Now some other literary evidence about the dates of which there are likely to be doubts and disputes would be set out. In the Vaikhānasa-smārta-sūtra (I. 4) and Baudhāyanadharma sūtra (II. 5. 23 ) tarpann (satiation with water ) is offered to the Sun, the Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, Saturn and to Rāhu and Ketu and the former mentions Budhavāra (Wednes. day ) in II 12. It has to be conceded that other sūtras such as Aśv. gr. III, 4. 1-5, the Kausitaki gr. (IV. 9-10), the Hir. gr. II, 19-20, Bhāradvāja gr. III. 9-11 contain no tarpniņa to the week days or their deities. The Atharvaņa-Vedānga Jyotisa has a section on weekdays (of eight yerses) and points out what should be done on each of the seven weekdays from Sunday to Saturday (two of which are quoted below by way of sample1073). The Gāthāsaptašati of Hāla (a prākrit anthology ) mentions Tuesday and Visti ( III. 61). The Yājñavalkya-smrti (I. 296 ) enumerates the planets in the modern weekday order from Sunday to Saturday and adds Rāhu and Ketu as gralis and provides for a sacrifice to nine grahas (I. 295-308). The Nāradapurāna (I. 51. 80 ) also does the same. The Matsya (chap. 93. 7 ff) provides for a more elaborate sacrifice to planets. The Vişnudharmasūtra (78.1-7) refers to śrāddhas performed on the seven weekdays from Sunday to Saturday and the benefits derived from such performance (vide H. of Dh. vol. IV. p. 373-374 for details). The Purānas contain numerous references to the

History of Dharmaśāstra (Sec. II, Ch. XVIII weekdays. The Nāradiya provides that Monday 1074, Wednes day, Thursday and Friday are auspicious for all rites and actions, while the other weekdays yield the desired result only in cruel or violent actions. The Matsya provides that all week days except Sunday and Tuesday are auspicious ( 253.7.). The Kūrmapurāna (Uttarārdha 20. 16-17) provides that śrāddhas on weekdays from Sunday to Saturday respectively yield the benefits of health, happiness ( or prosperity ), success, all desires, desired learning, wealth and long life. The Visņudharmottara ( I. 142. 30-32 ) has similar provisions. The Brahmapurāpa (118.30) recommends touching an aśvattha tree on Saturday. The Vāmana (14. 49-50 ) forbids certain actions on weekdays (such as an oil bath on Sunday or Tuesday). The Matsya specifically refers to Sunday (in chap. 55. 4, 65, 5, 70. 46 ), to Monday (in 57.4), to Tuesday (in 72. 27, 193. 8). Though the chronology of all the above works is somewhat uncertain, yet it cannot be gainsaid that at least in the first two centuries of the Christian era planets had become objects of worship and the weekdays had been named and their order as it exists today had been settled. The Mahābhārata, in spite of its vast extent and copious des criptions of Dharmaśāstra matters, is entirely silent about the names of weekdays. The cumulative effect of all the evidence adduced above is to render it extremely probable, if not certain, that the worship of the planets and knowledge of the weekdays presided over by them was known to the Indians at least bet ween 100 B. C. to 100 A. D One further circumstance is that the names of weekdays in India are purely Sanskrit and there is hardly any reference to a weekday in Sanskrit works under any Greek or other non-Indian name, while in the case of the signs of the zodiac frequent use is made of such foreign words as kriya or leya. Fotheringham (in explanations in Nautical Almanac for 1935 at p. 769 ) states that the mean temporal hour with the 

·length that it had at equinoxes is first found in Hipparchus ( 140 B. C.), that Ptolemy in the Tables in the Almagest reckon ed the day from mean noon of Alexandria and divided the day into sixty equal parts each of which was divided sexagesimally and that Ptolemy in his manual Tables divides the whole day into equinoctial hours reckoned from noon in Alexandria and subdivided these sexagesimally. This shows that two systems

of dividing the day into 60 parts and also into 24 parts were accepted by Ptolemy himself (who wrote only about 150 A. D.). Therefore, Indians could very well have used very early the 60 divisions system for finding out the order of the weekdays instead of 24 divisions system. The Indians did not calculate their day from noon or night but from the morning. The Āśvamedhika parva 1075 expressly says that the day comes first and then night. 

It is possible to advance several theories about the origin of the seven day week in India. The five planets ( Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn) were especially regarded by the ancient Babylonians as the powers controlling the destinies of men and therefore five leading Babylonian divinities were identified with the above five planets. In course of transmission Babylonian names of divinities assumed Roman forms i. e. Ishtar, goddess of love, became Venus, the great god Marduk became Jupiter and so on ( vide note 748 above). The five planets together with the Sun and the Moon made a group of seven heavenly bodies. In Chaldean temple worship which spread to Syria, it became the custom to sing the praises of each god on a particular day. The name of the god worshipped on a particular day was transferred to the day itself. The days which were sacred to the Sun and the Moon were called Sunday and Monday. Some Norse words like Wednesday (Woden's day) and Thursday (Thor's day ) were introduced in England. But weekdays in Europe are ulti mately derived from the Babylonian gods. It has already been shown (pp. 598-600 above ) that India and Babylonia had close commercial and other contacts from very ancient times. Vide the recent work on "Hittites' by O. R. Gurney (in Pelican Books, 1958), pp. 104-105 and 124 for technical Sanskrit words in horse breeding Vedic gods and royal names in Sanskrit in the 14th century B. C. It is possible to argue that seeing the temples of planetary gods in which worship was performed on certain days some Indians got the suggestion of a planetary week, as it has been suggested above that the ideas of the Zodiacal signs were derived from Babylonian boundary stones and similar monuments. There were Sun temples in ancient India 1076

such as that of Mārtanda in Kashmir, that of Modhera in North Gujerat and that of Koņārka in Orissa. Even now in some towns and villages there are temples of Saturn and Rābu (as at Rāhuri in the Ahmednagar District of the Bombay State, which bears that name after Rāhu). Kautilya mentions the several divisions of time from 'truta' to yuga and states that two nūdikūs are equal to a muhurta and an ahorūtra (day and night) has 30 muhūrtas ( vide note 681 above). From: this it follows that Kautilya knew only the division of the day into 60 nādis and that a nādi was the same as ghati. The Aryabhatiya gives the following table: 60 linādīs are equal to a nādi, 60 nādīs are equal to a day (Kālakriyāpāda, verse 1). Another way of citing the measures of time is: Time taken for repeating ten long letters is prāņa, 6 prānas are equal to pala, 60 palas ara equal to a danda, ghati or nādi (Sūryasiddhānta I. 11, Jyotist-attva p.562). Pāṇini derives the word 'nādindhama' 1077 from nādi. Nādi is a very ancient word.1078 It occurs in the Rgveda and appears to mean some cylindrical instrument like a flute. 1079 It appears that the word nādi came to mean a period of time when a conch or a trumpet or similar instrument was blown to announce the lapse of one nādi ( 60th part of the day) as there were no clocks then, Hence division into 60 nādis or gbatis (both words being mon tioned by Patañjali who is generally held to have flourished about 150 B. C.) was the ancient mode of dividing the day in India and if any Sanskrit work (like the Sūryasiddhānta, chap 12.78–79) refers to 24 parts of the day, that work may be regarded as one of later times, but the whole system of time measuring by weekdays in India cannot be said to have been borrowed from a foreign source. Even Patanjali refers to the words nādi and ghati as long in use before his time. Therefore, the division of the day

1078. The word 'nādi' and 'nādikā' have several meanings, viz. flute, tube or pipe, vein or artery, one half muhūrta. Nādindbama' means a goldsmith ( because he makes the fire fame up by blowing on it from & tube). From Kathakasambit 23, 4 (Saisā vanaspatisu vāg-vadati ya nadyan yā tūņave) it appears that nādi was a musical instrument that produced sounds (a trumpet or the like).

Division of day into nādis

into nādīs or ghatis must be held to be long anterior to 200 B. C. On the whole it would not be far from the truth to say that weekdays were not borrowed by ancient India en bloc from elsewhere. It is arguable that usages in Babylon and Syria might have suggested the arrangement of days into weeks, but there is hardly any cogent evidence beyond similarity and prejudice to show that the origin of the nomenclature and the method of arriving at the order of the weekdays were not indi genous. Vide Cunningham in I, A. vol. 14 pp. 1 ff, in which he shows by diagrams how the calculation by Indian ghatīs results in the same order of weekdays as the European division. Sham Shastri in Annals of Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, vol. IV pp. 1-31 after mentioning some rather hazy and obscure passages from the Vedic literature arrives at the conclusion that India was not indebted to the Greeks or Babylonians for week days or for the discovery of planets. It may be mentioned that Alberuni (tr. by Sachau, vol. I, chap. XIX pp. 214-215) illustrates how week-days received names from planets, narrates (p. 215) that it was the custom with Hindus to enumerate the planets in the order of the weekdays and that the Hindus persisted in using these in their astronomical books and declined to use any other order or method even if it was more correct. 

CHAPTER XIX 

Kalpa, Manvantara, Mahāyug : Yuga 

After dealing with time measures from yugn ( of five years) down to weekdays and the day one must now briefly deal with the other measures of time such as Yuga, Mahāyuga, Manvan tara and Kalpa. The word Kalpa has its germi in the Rgveda 1080 X. 190. 3, where it is said that the Creator created the Sun and the Moon, the heaven, the earth and mid--region as before.' The earliest datable reference to Kalpa is found in Aśoka's edicts e. g. the 4th Rock edict 1081 at Girnar and Kalsi have 'āva savata kapi' (yāyat samvartakalpam ) and 'āva kapam' in the 5th Rock Edict at Shahabazgarhi and Mansora. This establishes that the theories about the vast extent of Kalpa had been pro mulgated in India long before the third century BC. The Buddhists also took over the theory of Kalpas as is clear from the Mahāparinibbānasutta III 53 “ Vouchsafe, Lord, to remain during the Kalpa. Live on, O Blessed One, through the Kalpa for the good and happiness of the great multitudes &c.'. 

The beliefs that in the dim past there was an ideally perfect society followed by a gradual degeneracy and decline in standards of morals, health and length of life and that the cycle of decline would be followed in the far distant future by a golden age of perfection in morals &c. have been dealt with in H. of Dh. vol. III. pp. 885 ff. The word 'yuya' has been shown there as having probably several meanings, viz. a short period of time (Rg. III. 26.3 ), a cycle of five years and also a long period and a period of thousands of years. Prof. Mankad in Poona Orientalist ( vol. VI. pp. 211-212 ) assigns as many as ten meanings to the

1081. Vide fascriptions of Asoka in C. I. I. vol. I, pp. 6, 30 (text of 4th edict), and pp. 55, 74 ( text of 5th edict). In the Vanaparva 188, 69 it is said that fire called Sadvartaka will assail the world while the Brahmapurāna (232. 39) says that terrible clouds called "Samvartaka' will rise, when final dissolution (pralaya) will follow. Therefore, 'āva samvata kapā' means 

• up to the end of Kalpa when destructive fire called samvartaka will arise' (or when terrible clouds called samvartaka will arise ). It may be noted that the Amara-kośa regards Hadi, 474, 754, 974 and 97 as synonyms. 

Meanings of yuga

word. One cannot agree with him in all that he says. For example, he appears to be wrong when he says that in Sakuntala IV (yugāntaram ārūdhaḥ savitā ) yuga means įth of a day; yuga does not, so far as I know, mean ith anywhere, it means 'four' in some cases. In Sakuntala 'yugāntara &c.' should be taken to mean that the sun has come up in the sky as much as the length of a yoke (from the eastern horizon)'. That is the sense of 'yuga' in Rg. X, 60.8, X. 101. 3 and 4. In the Mahābhārata, in Manu and the Purāņas the theory of yugas, mancaniaras and kalpas has been elaborated at great length. The four yugas are named Krta, Tretā, Dvāpara and Tisya or Kali and concern only Bhārata-varsa. 1081a But it has been shown (at pp. 886-890 of the H. of Dh, vol. III.) that originally these were the names of cer tain throws of dice in gambling and that from the 4th century B.C. (if not earlier) they came to be the designations of the ages of man. The early Gupta inscriptions refer to Kitayuga as a cycle of great virtues ( as in the Bilsad stone pillar Inscription of Kumāragupta in Gupta Samvat 96 in 'Gupta Inscriptions' p. 44, the Chammak copperplate of Vākātaka Pravarasena II in 'Gupta Inscriptions' p. 237, Pattan plates of Pravarasena II. in E. 1. 23 p. 81. The theory of Yugas, Manvantaras and Kalpas is elaborated among ancient works in the Mahābhārata (Vana parva, chapters 149, 158 and Sāntiparya, chap. 69 and 231-232 ), Manu I. 61-74, 79-86, Visnudharmasūtra chap. 20. 1-21, Vispu purāna 1.3, 6.3, Brahmapurāņa 5. 229-232, Matsya 142-145, Vāyu chap. 21, 22, 57, 58, 100, Kūrma I. chap. 51 and 53, Brahmānda II. 6 and 31-36, III. 1, Mārkandeya 58 64, 66-70, 71-97 ( has the

(Sec. II, Ch. XIX 

longest account of Manvantaras), and by astronomical writers and works such as Aryabhata, Sūryasiddhānta, Brahmagupta, Siddhantaširomani. None of these works enables us to furnish a satisfactory explanation about the rise of this system of Kalpas, Manyantaras and Yugas. Pargiter (in AIHT p.175 ) thinks that the division into four ages had a historical basis. That may or may not be so. But what historical explanation can be offered about manvantaras and kalpas is not stated anywhere. The theory of yugas concerned only Bhāratavarşa as stated in several Purāņas. All these works contain the same general features but there are many divergences in details. As the Manusmrti contains one of the oldest accounts, a summary of its remarks will be first set out. First, seven Manus are enume rated viz. Svāyambhuva, Svārocişa, Uttama, Tāmasa, Raivata, Cāksuşa and Vaivasvata. Then divisions of time from nimesa are specified ( 18 nimesa = Kāşthā, 30 Kāşthās = Kalā, 30 Kalās = Muhurta, 30 Muhūrtas = ahorātra ); it is then said that the human month is the day and night of putts, the human year is divine ahorālra. Krta-yuga extends over 4000 1082 years, sandhyā (twilight ) before it is 400 years, sandhyāmsa after it is 400 years. The three other yugas Tretā, Dvāpara and Kali have respectively 3000, 2000, 1000 years and sandhyās and sandhyā. mśas together of respectively 600, 400 and 200 years. The four yugas thus come to 12000 years ( 4300 plus 3600 plus 2400 plus 1200 ); this is called the yuga of gods (i. e. this is the divya measure ) and 1000 of these four come to one day of Brahmā and the same is the extent of the night of Brahmā. Seventy-one yugas of 12000 divine years each constitute a manyantara and Manu (I. 80) winds up by saying that manvantaras are numberless 1083 and so are creations and dissolutions. It should 





1082. Manu I. 65-67 are the same as sāntiparva 231. 15-17, Manu I. 65-66 are the same as Matsya 142. 5-6 (with slight variations), Madu I. 69-70 are the same as Sānti 231. 20-21, Vāyu 57. 23-24 and Matsya 142. 19-20. Manu I. 69 is same as Vanaparva 188. 22-23,

1083. It was said by Manu (1. 81-82) that Kyta was an age in which Dharma was four-footed and perfect, that in the other ages dharma declined successively by one foot, that theft, falsehood and fraud increase ia propor tion. Then Manu further avers (I. 83-86 ) that the length of human life in the four ages is respectively 400, 350. 200 and 100 years, tbat the set of duties differ in the four ages. Dharma is said to be four-footed because Manu VIII 16 identifies dharma with vrsa (buil). Both Plato and Aristotle believed that every art and science bad many times developed to its apogee and then deteriorated. 

Kulmas anil Manvantaras 

689 

be noticed that the word Kalpa does not occur in this long enume ration. But in other works than the Manusmrti e.g. Vişnupurāņa (V1.3. 11-12) fourteen Manvantaras are said to constitute a Kalpa, which is a day of Brahmā. As a day of the gods is equal to a human year, the 12000 years that constitute a divine caturyuja are equal to 4320000 human year: 1083.4 (12000 x 360) i. e, this is the human (mā iuşa ) measure of time. 

When and how these huge numbers of years for the yugas were suggested remains somewhat enigmatic. It appears that as early as the Satapatha-brāhmana people had become familiar with huge figures. The Satapatha 1084 says that there are 10800 muhūrtas in a year (in one ahorātra 30 X 360), that Prajāpati arranged the Rgveda in such a way that the number of syllables it contains is equal to 12000 Brhatis ( each Brhati having 36 syllables ) i. e. 432000 syllables and it is further stated that the Rgveda also contains 10890 panktis (each pankti having 10 syllables i.e. the syllables are 10800 X 40 = 432000. Prajāpati is said to have arranged the other two Vedas also and the three Vedas amounted to ten thousand eight hundred eighties (that is 80 x 10:00 = 864000 syilables ), that muhurtu by muhurta he gained eighty syllables (as there are 10800 muhurtas in a sacrificial year of 360 days). Dr. Jean Filliozat, Professor at the College de France, Paris, puts forward the theory in a recent article (in the Bulletin 

1083 a. Many ancient authors in almost all countries believed that there were different ages with differing levels of virtue and that they themselves lived in the worst age. Vide Hesiod's' Works and days 'pp. 11-17 (Loeb Classical Library) where Hesiod's own age was said to be the worst of five ages. The Babylonians made out 2160000 years for the duration of the world and imagined there were three ages, viz. golden, silver and copper, Vide pp, 33-34 of Maclean's Babylonian astrology in relation to the Old Testament'. Sarton also thinks that the Sumeriaas originated a golden age of man and speak of huge numbers of years, viz. 12,960,000 (PP. 69 and 118 of' a History of Science'). Berossus gave a list of tea ante-deluvian kings reigning in all for 432000 years (see Cambridge Ancient History, 1923, vol. I. page 150 ). Vide Heath's 'Greek astronomy' (Introduction, p.

Vide . Ancient relations between Indian and foreign astronomical systems' by Dr. J. Filliozat in JOR, Madras, vol. XXV ( for 1957 ) pp. 1-8; also Prof. Zinner (in 'Stars above us' p. 59 ) for theories about the age of the world held by Plato and Berossus. One day of Brahmā is equal to a Kalpa i. e. 4320000 x 1000 i. e. 432,000,000,0. In order 1085 to find out the humanı years of the one hundred years of Brahma's life we shall have to multiply 32,000,0000 by 2, then by 360 and then by 100. That is, the day and night of Brahma come to 8640000000 human years; the year of Brahmā would then be equal to 3110400000000 human years ( taking 360 days as a year); one hundred years of Brahmā thus come to 311040000000000 years. Alberuni ( Sachau, vol. I p. 332 ) also mentions this colossal figure about the life of Brahmā. Somo said that the extent of Brahma's life was 108 years.

are going on. The past six Manus are Svāyambhuva, Svārocisa, Uttama, Tāmasa, Raivata, Cākşuşa and the present is Vaivasvata, the 7th Manu (Brahma 5. 4-5, Kūrma I. 51. 4-5, Vispu III. 1. 6–7). The remaining seven Manus are differently named in several Purāņas e. g. Visņu (III. 2. 14 ff) and Narasimhapurāna 24. 17–35 mention the future Manus as Sāvarni, Daksa Sāvarpi, Brahniasāyarpi, Dharmasāvarnika, Rudra-sāvarpi, Ruci and Bhauma; while Brahma (5. 5-6 ) mentions four of the future seven as Sāvarni, Raibhya, Raucya, Merusāvarui. Kūrma (I. 53. 30–31) names the future four in the same way as Vispu (only substituting Savarņa for Sāvarni wherever it occurs and the last two as Raucya and Bhautya). All the fourteon Manus are enumerated in Nāradapurāna I, 40. 20–23. Alberuni (tr. by Sachau, vol. I. chap. XLIV p. 387 ) gives the names of Manvan taras according to the Visņudharmottara, l'isnupurāna and other sources. Sāvarṇya 1088 Manu as a great benefactor and leader of some territory occurs in Rg. X. 62. 11. It is said that each Manvantara had a separate set of sages, sons of Manu, gods, kings, smrtis, Indra and guardians for the proper regulation of dharma and for the protection of the people (Brahma 5. 39, Vispupurāna III. chapters 1-2). In the Visnupurāņa it is said that some gods remain for four yugas, some for a manvantara and some stay for a kalpa, 10887 The Visņudharmasūtra (chap. XX. 1-15 ) has the same account of Manvantaras and Kalpas as Manu's but it adds one detail viz. that the whole ago of Brahmā is equal to a day of Purusa ( Vişnu) and the night of Purusa is also as long. It is remarkable that the same view is attributed by Alberuni (Sachau vol. I. p. 332 ) to the Pulišasiddhānta. It is not known whether those European scholars who regard Puliša to be Paulus Alexandrinus have shown that this detail occurs in the work of the Greek Astrologer Paulus.

except this that 12000 years are called Yuga 1089 simply and not caturyuga (as in Manu I. 71 ). The Markandeya has a long story about Svārocisa in chapters 58-65, devotes to Uttama chap. 66-70, chapter 71 to Tāmasa, chap. 72 to Raivata, chap. 73 to Caksusa, chap. 74-76 to Vaivasvata, chap. 77 to Savarni, chap. 78-90 to Devi, chap. 91-95 to Raucya or Ruci, chap. 96-97 to Bhautya. The word 'Vaivasvata '(son of Vivasvat, the Sun) is applied to Yama in several passages of the Rgveda (X. 14. 1, X. 58. 1, X. 60. 10, X. 164.2). The Anukramani, however, ascribes Rg. VIII. 27-31 to Vaivasvata Manu as the rsi and in one of the Valakhilya hymns (Rg. X. 52. 1) occurs the following verse 'O Indra! just as you drank the soma extracted in (the sacrifice of) Manu Vivasvat, just as you frequently accept the hymn of praise in ( sacrifice of) Trita, so may you simultaneously delight in ( the soma and praise) of Ayu.' 1023 It may be noted that the Manusmrti names only the seven Manus ( I. 61-63) and states that each Manu during his own time (which extended over thousands of years ) created the movable and iramovable world and protected it, that Manvantaras are numberless ( Manusmrti I. 80) and that the Great God (Paramesthin) brought about the creation and destruction of the world during the Manvantaras. Some of the Puranas such as Matsya (9. 37-39, 142. 40, 144. 97-98), Vayu (59. 34), Agni (150.21), Visnu ( I. 3 and VI. 3) state 1090a that Manu and the seven sages in each Manvantara (i. e. where there is a change of Manu) who are the sistas that then exist are devoted to dharma, being ordered by Brahmā for the purpose of continuing the worlds, declare the truth and promulgate the Vedas.

693 

writers (like Dr. Daftari ) think 10906 that in ancient times there was an Indian institution of public functionaries called Manu and the Saptarsis, whose function was to legislate and promul gate the Vedas. With great respect to the erudite scholar, I dis agree with him. The extant Purāņa passages are less than 2000 years old, while the present Vaivasvata Manyantara started several millions of years ago and even Kaliyuga in which we are deemed to live started in 3102 B.C. Besides, there is a dissolution of the world at each day of Brahmā, if one is to rely on the Paurāņik accounts. How could a tradition of the several Manus survive such pralaya? A rationalistic interpretation requires that all this that is stated in the Purāņas is mere conjecture and imagination and that one cannot safely build theories about the governance of society in ancient times on the accounts contained in Purānas. The Manusmști (11, 19 ) appears to assign the function of the regulation of the conduct of all men in the world to the learned brāhmaṇas born in Brahmarşideśa (i. e. Kuruksetra, the countries of Matsya, Pañcāla and Surasena or Mathura) at least after his own code was promulgated. 

Pessimistic and dismal accounts of what will happen in Kaliyuga ( which extends according to the Purānas over 432000 years and of which only about 5057 years have gone by this time in 1956 ) are set forth in the Vanaparva, chap. 188, 190, Sānti parya 69. 80-97, the Harivamsa (Bhavisyaparva, chap. 3-5 ff.), Brahmapurāņa chap. 229-230, Vāyu chap. 58 and 99 verses 391-428, Matsya 144. 32-47, Kurma I. 30, Visnupurāņa VI. 1, Bhāgayata XII. 1-2, Brahmānda II. 31 and in several other purāṇas. The description in Vanaparva 188 is summarised in H. of Dh. vol. III pp. 893-895. The names of 33 Kalpas are given in Vāyu, chap. 21-23 and Hemādri on Kāla (pp. 670-671 ) sets out from Nāgarakhanda the names of 33 Kalpas and the tithis on which they start; Matsya 290 enumerates thirty names of Kalpas; the Brahmapda Il. 31. 119 states that there are 35 Kalpas and neither more nor less. 

In the purānas pralaya is said to be of four sorts, 1091 viz. nilya ( the every day deaths of those that are born), naimittika

( when a day of Brahmā ends, then there is a dissolution of the world), prākrtika ( when everything dissolves itself into prakrti, primordial substance) and ātyantika pralaya is Mikșa (liberation of the soul due to correct knowledge of Reality and absorption into the Supreme Spirit ). Harrowing descriptions of the naimittika and prākřtika pralayas are given in several purānas. A lengthy description of the naimittika dissolution is contained in Kūrma II. 45. 11-59 of which a brief summary is given here. When the one thousand Caturyugas end, there is the absence of rain for a hundred years; the result is that living beings perish and are reduc ed to earth; the sun's rays become unbearable, and even the ocean is dried up; the earth is burnt by the fierce heat of the sun together with its mountains, forests and continents. As the sun's rays fall burning up everything, the whole world presents the appearance of one huge fire. Fire burns everything whether mobile or immoveable. The animals in the big seas come out and are reduced to ashes. Then the samyartaka fire growing by the force of the wind burns the whole earth and its flames rise up to a height of thousands of yojanas and the flames burn up gandharras, goblins, yakşas, serpents and rākşasas and not only the earth but the worlds called 'bhuvaḥ' and 'mahaḥ' are burnt; then huge sasvartaka clouds resembling herds of elephants, lit up by lightning, rise in the sky, some looking like blue lotuses, some yellowish, some having the colour of smoke, some like sealing wax and fill the whole sky and then extinguish the fires by sending down heavy showers. When the fires are extingu ished, the clouds of destruction cover the whole world with floods; mountains are concealed and the earth is plunged in waters and all becomes onle ocean of water and then god Brahmā resorts to Yogic sleep. Vanaparva ( chap. 273. 32-48) also contains a brief description of nainittika pralaya. 

The Kūrma I. 46 and Vişnu VI. 4. 12-49 furnish a descrip tion of the prākstika pralaya which takes Sānkhya terminology for granted, 1092 and is briefly as follows: when all the worlds

including all the nether regions are destroyed by absence of rains and all effects from mahat onwards are destroyed, waters first absorb the gandha (the special quality of the earth ) and when gandha-tanmātra is destroyed, the earth is reduced to water; the special quality of waters, viz. rasa-tanmātra is des troyed and nothing but fire remains and the whole world is filled with flames, then Vāyu absorbs fire and rūpa-tanmātra vanishes ; Vāyu shakes all the ten quarters; ākāśa absorbs the sparsa-guna of Vāyu and only ākāśa remains as a void and sabda-tanmātra is gone and in this way the seven prakrtis including mahut and ahankāra are absorbed in order; even Praksti and Purusa are dissolved in Paramātman ( named Visņu). The day of Visņu is said to be two Parārdhas of human years. 

Some works like the Harivamsa (Bhavisyaparva chap. 10. 12-68) provide that at the end of Kalpa the sage Mārkandeya alone remains and lies at the time of the pralaya( or kalpa ) in the side of Lord Vispu and then coines out of His mouth. The Brahma. purāņa ( 52.1--19 and 53. 55) says that Mārkandeya soes a rata tree at the end of Kalpa and a jewelled bed on which he sees a boy lying down (i. e. Vispu himself ) and then he enters the side of that boy and later comes out. Vide also Matsya 167 (14-66) for the same story in almost the same words. The Bhagavadgitā (VIII. 18-19) speaks of the recurrent absorption of all beings at the advent of the night of Brahma and reappearance of beings when the day of Brahmā starts. 

The theory of yugas, manyantaras and kalpas with their fabulous numbers of years and harrowing descriptions of pralaya, appears unreal, bizarre and called up by sheer fancy. But under lying it there is the idea of the timelessness of the universe, though from time to time it evolves, gradually declines and perishes, only to reappear in perfection after a cosmic night. There is also the hankering after Reality and pursuit of different ideals. It enshrines the ideas that humanity embarks on a certain goal, pursues it with great efforts and, after achiev ing some success, gives up that goal and the way that was thought to lead to it and pursues some other goal for aoons in the hope that at some distant date it will be able to evolve and

construct a perfect society. These ideas are at the bottom of what Manu 1093 and others say Tapas was the highest goal (deemed to yield great results ) in Kitayuga, knowledge (of the self) was the highest in Tretā, yajña (sacrifices to God) in Dvāpara, charity alone in Kali'. This further implies that there are different impelling motives in different ages and modern men should not assess the actions and ideals of past ages by the same yardstick that is applied to contemporary actions and ideals. It is im plicit in the words of Manu (XI.301 ) that the four ages are not water-tight specific periods of time, but that the Ruler or Govern ment can produce conditions of Kţta age in what is popularly called Kali by appropriate conduct or measures and Medhātithi expressly says so. 109a Prof. Mankad has a novel theory in a paper on the manvantaras in I. H. Q. vol XVIII, pp. 208–230, where he states that the Caturyuga formula took 40 years for a ruling unit and not for one king's regnal period and that the manvantara was the regular method of calculating regnal periods of different kings in a dynasty (p. 237 ). Hardly any scholar has accepted this theory and for reasons of space and relevance, it is not possible to discuss it here. 

In the details about the theory of yugas, manvantaras and kalpas there are some divergences. A few may be pointed out. Āryabhata appears to hold that the extent of each of the four yugas was the same and not in the traditional proportion of 4, 3, 2, 1, when he says that he was twenty-three years old when three yugapārlas and 3600 years had elapsed (vide Kālakriyāpāda 10 quoted in note 995 above ). Brahmagupta (I. 9) says 1094 that, though Aryabhata declared that the four pādas of yugas, viz. Krta

and the others, were equal, not one of them was equal to what the smrtis declare them to be. There is another discrepancy also. Aryabhata in his Dasagitikā Verse 3 states that Manu is a period of 72 yugas, while all the smrtis and purānas declare that a manvantara is equal to 71 yugas. Āryabhata appears to have held that the day of Brahmā is equal to 1008 caturyuyas and Brahmagupta ( I. 12) refers to this view. The celebrated scientific astronomer Bhāskarācārya 1095 (born in saka 1036, 1114 A. D.) impatiently says some say that half of the life of Brahmā (i. e. 50 years ) has passed away, while others say that half plus eight years has passed away. Whatever the true tradi tion may be, it is of no use, since planetary positions are to be established from the days that have passed in the current day of Brahmā.' 

As incidental to the colossal figures of the years of Kalpas and Yugas, a few words on numerals, their antiquity and the methods of writing numerals would not be out of place, In the Rgveda numerals from 1 to 10 are frequently used. 'Sahasra (thousand) and' ayuta'( ten thousand) occur in Rg. IV. 26.7, VIII. 1. 5, VIII. 21 18. One of these sa yg 10% O wielder of thunderbolt! O immensely rich ( Indra )! I shall not give thee away even for a big price, not for a thousand, not for ten thousand, nor for hundreds'. In Rg. VIII. 46.22 a poet says 'I secured 60000 and several tens of thousands of horses, 20 hundreds of camels, one thousand dark coloured mares and ten thousands of cows bright in three parts of their bodies.' In Rg. I. 53. 9 Indra is said to have struck down sixty thousand and 99 enemies. Vide Rg. I. 126. 3 ( for sixty thousand cows), VIII, 4. 20 and VIII. 46. 29 for 60000 and VI. 63. 10 for one hundred thousand horses. In some of these the larger numbers are mentioned first and the smaller ones next (as in Rg. I. 53. 9, VIII. 46. 22 ); in others it is the reverse. No conclusion can therefore be drawn that the smaller numbers come first in the Rgvedic times. In Tai. S. IV. 4. 11. 3-4 reference is made to bricks in numbers from one, one hundred, thousand, ayuta ( ten thousand), niyuta, prayuta, arbuda, nyarbuda, samudra, madhya, anta and parardha, while in Tai. S.

The Nirukta (III. 10) gives the derivation of eka, dvi, tri, catur, asta, nava, dasa, vimsati, sata, sahasra, ayuta, niyuta, prayuta, arbuda. Pāṇini (V. 1. 59 ) mentions pankti ( ten), viinsati, trimsat, catvārimsat, pancasat, sasti, saptati, aśīti, navati and sata and the Mahābhāsya on the 4th vārtika on that sūtra mentions sahasra, ayuta and arbuda among numbers. In Sabhiparva 1097 numbers from aynta to parūridh i are mentioned as noted below. Aryabhata mentions 1098 only ten orders from eka to arbuda. ( hundred million) and vinda ( thousand million). The Vayupurana (101. 93-102) mentions the 18 orders of numbers from one to parārdha in a slightly confused manner. It may be noted that the ancient Greeks had no single word for 

million. 

The Vispupurāna 1099 states that parārdha is 18th order of numbers from one, each order being ten times as much as its predecessor. The 18 orders or units of reckoning as employed for many centuries in India are set out here. 1100

Herein he appears to have followed the Vāyu and other purānas. Aparārka p. 413 notes verses about the 18 sthānas in which 'niyuta' occurs for ten laksas (and not prayuta), Vĩnda for ' Abja' or 'Padma'; 'Sankha' and 'Padma' for 'Mahāpadma' and 'Sanku'. 

That the decimal system itself goes back thousands of years from the present follows from the references in the Samhitās. But the question whether the lecinul positional or place valuz system prevailed in Vedic times is rather a different and difficult one. It is generally 1101 admitted that the place value decimal system that now prevails in Europe and all modern countries was Indian in origin and was introduced about the 12th century A. D. in Europe by the Arabs who borrowed it from India. The decimal place value notation is said to be one of the most fertile inven

tions of man. There is a good deal of literature on this subject which is passed over here as not material for our purpose. One of the latest works on this system is · From Zero to Infinity' by Constance Reid (Routledge and Kegan Paul, London, 1956). Zero is the first of ten symbols with which one can represent an infinitude of numbers and it is also the first of the numbers. This work says that the zero escaped even the greatest Greeks, Pythagoras, Euclid and Archimedes (p. 4). The Egyptians 1102 had a decimal system of numerals but no sign for zero and therefore no positional notation, which even the Greeks did not know; ancient Babylonians also had no definite symbol for zero and there is no example of zero signs at the end of numbers even in their latest astronomical writings. It is difficult to say when exactly a symbol or word for zero was employed in India. But it must nave been several centuries before the beginning of the Christian era. Pingala's work on metres is a terlūnga. Pingala's sūtra on metres makes use of zero (šūnya ) in VIII. 28-31. Even the Satapatha Br. (XI. 4. 3 20) seems to be aware of Vedāngas. But it may be argued that there is nothing to show that Piogala's work was known to it. It is most probably 

1102. Vide 'Legacy of Egypt' (Glanville p. 166), E S. A. by Neuge bauer p. 20, Sarton in 'a History of Science' p. 69; Prof. Neugebauer in JAOS. vol. 61 pp. 213-215 avers that strong arguments exist for the assump tion that the Babylonian methods of calculation weot, together with Greek Astronomy, to India, and that, sometime in the first centuries of the Christian era, the corresponding decimal place value Dotation in India, which through the Arabs gave rise to the modern system of Europe. With great respect the author must demur to these assertions, The learned writer endeavours to show that a peculiar sign was used for zero in Mesopotamian cuneiform texts. The important questions that must be answered are; who discovered the symbol for zero now used almost throughout the world, whether the so-called sign for zero which Prof. Neugebauer asserts he has discovered in cuneiform texts was ever used in Europe or for that matter any. where in the world except in Mesopotamia, what direct relation exists between the Indian zero symbol and the recently discovered zero symbol ( which no one had found so far ), whether the symbols for 1 to 9 in India bear any resemblance to the Mesopotamian symbols for these numbers, whether the Greeks (who admittedly borrowed many tbiogs from Meso potamia ) used the Mesopotamian zero symbol and, if so, when. The 19th century was distinguished by the theories of Western Scholars claiming that science, pbilosophy and arts began in Greece and that other nations borrowed these from the Greeks. That bubble of Greek primacy in these matters has now been pricked. The twentinth century appears to be heading for giviog to Mesopotamia the place once assigned to the Greeks. The Mesopotamian bubble raised by some scholars may be pricked in course of time, particularly as regards others borrowing from them. 

Several methods of writing numerals 

701 

mentioned as Chandoviciti in the Āpastamba-dharmasūtra 1103 Sabara 1104 ( about 200 A. D. and not later than 400 A. D.) speaks of Pingala's work as on the same level with Pāṇini's sūtra. It is unnecessary to offer further proofs of the antiquity of Pingala's sūtra. 

There were several methods of writing numerals. One was the place value notation, in which the same numeral has different values according to the place it occupies; for example, the figure two may have the value of only two or twenty or two hundred and so on according as it occupies the units place or tens place or hundreds place. Another way is that of employing words to denoto complete numbers. This was a very reliable method when in astronomy huge figures had to be employed and works were not printed but only copied by hand. In ancient times, the writers of mss. might often omit zeros or other figures, but if words with a fixed meaning in relation to numbers were used, they would not be so easily dropped and as many works were metrical, the omission of a word, if any, might have been far more easily detected. It is difficult to say when this system was introduced. But its beginnings are ancient. For example, the word krta -is used in the Taittiriya 1105 Brāhmaṇa in the sense of 'four'. Varāhamihira (beginning of the 6th century A. D. I employs these word numerals but in the place value system (vide H. of Dh. vol. III, p. 897 n. 1763.) The following is a list of some of the very usual numbers with the corresponding words employed to indicate them It should be noted that the list is not exhaus tive. Any number of synonyms 1106 may be employed to indicate the same number. Vide the lists in Alberuni ( Sachau, vol. I. pp. 174-179 ) and Bühler's 'Indian Paleography' (I. A. vol. 33; appendix pp. 83-86 ).

and in Brhat-sambitā 8. 20 and by all later astronomical writers. 1109 The particular matter to be noted is that the first word in a group ( denoting a number ) is to be assigned to the units place, the next to its left in the tens place, so that a word like 'saptāśvi-veda-sankhyam' becomes 4:7 (by the rule 'ankānām vāmato gatih'). 

Another method for expressing numbers is elaborated by Āryabhata in his Daśagitikāpāda 1119 ( verse 3) where the letters from k ( kā also ) to m have the values of 1 to 25, while y'i, ru, la, va, śa, șa, sa and ha stand for 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90 and 100 and so on towards more complicated matters. 

The fourth anga in a pancānga is called Yoga. There is no direct astronomical phenomena corresponding to it. It is calculated from the suin of the longitudes of the Sun and the Moon (or it is the time during which the sun and the moon together accomplish 13 degrees and 20 minutes of space). When this amounts to degrees 13. 20 the first Yoga called Viskambha ends; when it amounts to 26. 40 the 2nd Yoga Prīti ends and so on. The yogas are 27 ( that thus make 360 degrees ) as stated 

in the Ratnamālā IV. 1-3 and are as follows : 

Name Deity 1. Viskambha — Yama. 15. Vajra - Varuņa. 2. Priti - Vispu. 

16. Siddhi --Ganesa. 3. Ayusmat-Candra. 17. Vyatīpāta --Siva. 4. Saubhāgya - Brahmā. 18. Variyas —- Kubera. 5. Sobhana — Bṛhaspati. 19. Parigha --Viśvakarman. 6. Atiganda-Candra. 20. Siva -- Mitra. 7. Sukarman-Indra. 21. Siddha - Kārtikeya. 8. Dhṛti - Āpah.

Ever-recurring yogas 

705 

. 

These are nitya (ever-recurring) Yogas. The Ratnamala states that they yield good or bad results in keeping with their names. The Muhurtadarśana 1111 states that among these 27 yogas nine are condemned, viz. Parigha, Vyatipāta, Vajra, Vyaghata, Vaidhrti, Viskambha, Sula, Ganda1112 and Atiganda. The Ratnarnālā provides that Vyatipāta and Vaidhști aro wholly inauspicious, the first half of Parigha is so and only the first quarter of those Yogas the names of which are odious; and that one should avoid in all auspicious rites the first three ghatikās in Viskambha and Vajra, nine ghatis in Vyāghāta, five in Sūla, six in Ganda and Atiganda. The Agnipurana 1113 (127. 1-2) has similar verses. The Kālanirnaya-kārikā 1114 provides that when a Yoga spreads over two days, fasts and the like are to be observed on the first of the two days provided that Yoga exists at sunset on that day, and vratas and religious gifts are to be performed on the latter ( of two days ) provided the Yoga exists for three 

muhurtas (i. e. six ghatis) after sunrise and for sraddha the day on which the Yoga extends over the time required for the śrāddha rite should be accepted, 

The system of Yogas must be held to be ancient. The Yājña valkyasmrti (I. 218) when specifying the times for the perfor mance of śrāddhas includes Vyatīpāta among them. In the Harşacarita of Bāņa it is said ( Ucchrāsa IV) that Harsa was born on a day free from the taint of all defects such as Vyatipāta (vyatīpātādi-sarvadosābhişanga-rahiteshani). There would gene rally be 13 vyatipātas in a year ( sometimes 14 ) and, among the 96 śrāddhas, śrāddhas on these thirteen vyatipātas are

included (vide H. of Dh. vol. IV pp. 382-383 and note 861 ). Besides these 27 Yogas, there are others that occur when there are special conjunctions of weekdays with certain tithis and naksatras or when certain planets occupy certain rāśis on certain tithis and nakşatras. For Kapilāşasthiyoga and Ardho daya, vide above pp. 279 and 261. Vyatipāta itself has two technical senses apart from being 17th out of the 27 Yogas mentioned above viz. (1) When amāvāsyā 1115 occurs on a Sunday and the moon is in the first quarter on any one of the nakşatras Sravaņa, Aśvini, Dhanisthā, Ārdrā and Āśleşā that is Vyatīpāta; (2) When on the 12th of the bright half Jupiter and Mars are in the sign Lion, the Sun is in Ram and when that tithi has Hasta naksatra on it, it is Vyatipāta 1116 Yoga. These two are sometimes called Mahāvyatipāta. Gifts made on those conjunc tions are very much commended ;1117 'gifts on amāvāsyā yield one hundred-fold merit, on the suppression of a tithi a thousand-fold, on Visuva day ten thousand-fold, buton Vyatīpāta endless (merit). By gifts of cows, land, gold and clothes made on this the donor becomes free from sin and secures godhead, the position of Indra, health, the rulership of men. 1118 The Sūryasiddhānta (XI. 1-2) gives an explanation of Vyatipāta and Vaidhrta1119 (or Vaidhrti). when the sun and the moon are on the same side of either solstice and when the sum of their longitudes being a circle they are of equal declination it is styled Vaidhști.

longitudes being a half circle. Why the times mentioned should be looked upon as specially inauspicious or unfortunate is not at all clear and no plausible reason has been assigned. The 27th Yoga called Vaidhrti was just like Vyatīpāta in all respects. Bharadvāja says that the merit of gifts made on Vyatipāta and Vaidhrti is endless. 

In the pancangas several Yogas (that have nothing to do with the 27 yogas ) like Amrtasiddhi, Yamaghanta, Dagdhayoga, Mrtyuyoga, Ghabāda are mentioned; they are purely astrological and all of them except three are passed over here for reasons of space. When on Sunday there is Hasta, on Monday Mļgaśirsa, on Tuesday Aśvini, on Wednesday Anurādha, on Thursday Tisya (i. e. Pusya ), on Friday Revati and on Saturday Rohini, all these are Amṛtasiddhiyogas (fortunate ones 1120 ). Avoid Anu rādhā on Sunday, Uttarāsādhā on Monday, Satatārakā on Tuesday, Ašvini on Wednesday, Mrgaśīrṣa on Thursday, Aślosa on Friday and Hasta on Saturday-- these are seven Mṛtyuyogas (inauspicious ). If the weekdays from Sunday to Saturday occur on the tithis, 12th, 11th, 10th, 3rd, 6th, 2nd, 7th respec tively, these are Dagdhayogas ( inauspicious yogas). 

The fifth item in a pañcā nga is Karana. Half of a tithi is Karaña and thus there are two Karapas in a tithi and 60 Karanas in a lunar month. Karanas are of two kinds, viz, cara (moving) and sthira ( immoveable). The seven cara karañas with their presiding deities according to Brhatsamhitā, chap. 99. 1-2 are: 1. Bava-Indra; 2. Bālava-Brahmā; 3 Kaulava-Mitra; 4. Taitila-Aryaman; 5. Gara ( or Garaja )- Earth; 6. Vanija Śrī; 7. Visti-Yama. The four sthira karaṇas with their deitieg are : 1. Sakuni --Kali; 2. Catuspada - Vrsa; 3. Nāga-snake; 4. Kimstughna-Vāyu. Some works transpose the two, Catuspada and Nāga. This division of a tithi into two halves resembles the division of a rāśi into two horās (Brbajjātaka I. 9). It is likely that one was suggested by the other. The difficulty is to decide which was the earlier. I believe it likely that the division of tithis into two karapas is the earlier of the two. The sthira karapas occur only once in a month i. e, on the latter half of

14th tithi of dark half occurs Sakuni: Catuspada and Nāga occupy the two halves of amāvāsyā and Kimstughna occurs on the first half of Pratipad i. e, if the 30 tithis of an aminta month are divided into 60 halves, Sakuni, Catuspada and Nāga occupy the 58th, 59th and 60th parts and Kimstughna occupies the first half of the pratipad of the next month. Bava occupies the second half of śukla pratipad and the others follow one after another and as they are only seven they are repeated eight times in a month from the 2nd half of pratipad to the first half of the 14th tithi of a dark half, which would be 57th of the sixty halves of the tithis of the month and would be occupied by Visti. In the pancāngas, two karanas should properly be shown under each tithi, but in pañcāngas only that Karaṇa is shown against a tithi whose ending moment is 30 ghatikās or less from sunrise. The ending times of Karanas which are assigned to the 2nd halves of tithis coincide with those of the tithis themselves and therefore there is no need for their calculation. The ending times of the first halves of tithis which correspond to certain Karanas are got in the manner described by Pillai in his Indian Ephemeris', vol. I. part 1 p. 37, paragraphs 106-107. 

The word Karaṇa is derived from the root'ks' (to do ) and is said to have been so named because it divides a tithi in two parts. 1121 The names of most of the Karanas are somewhat strange and inexplicable. The word 'Taitila-kadrū' occurs in Pāṇini VI. 2. 42 (with regard to accent) but the Kāśikā ex plains that Taitila means a descendant or pupil or Titilin'. If a more conjecture were to be offered, the Karaħa Taitila might have been first named after a man so called. The Karañas are only of astrological use and must have been named many centuries before 400 A. D. The Nāradapurāna 1122 mentions both kinds of Karañas. The Brhat-samhitā lays down what should be done or not done on the several Karanas 1123 as follows: one

What should be done on Karanas 

709 

should perform on Bava all auspicious ( religious ) rites, all acts that bring about physical health: on Bālava religious acts and acts beneficial to brāhmaṇas; on Kaulava acts leading to good relations and friendship and choosing a bride; on Taitila acts that lead to popularity with people, to securing the patronage ( of some important person ) and building a house : on Gara actions pertaining to ploughing, sowing seeds and those that arise in houses; on Vanija, acts of a permanent nature, trading, and meeting with people; whatever is done on Visti does not bring about fortunate results; but actions as regards destruction of enemies, poisoning and incendiarism become successful on it; on Sakuni one should do what leads to physical health and inedication, planting roots and eating them and becoming suc cessful in mantras; on Catuspada actions relating to cows (i. e. gifts of them and rearing them ), actions regarding brāhmanas and one's ancestors and king's business should be done; on Nāga, acts relating to immoveable property, cruel acts, depriv ing ( a man of his wealth or wife ) and acts that lead to hatred among people; on Kimstughna, auspicious ( religious ) acts, Vedic sacrifices (called iştis ) and acts leading to physical prosperity and mangala acts (marriage &c.) and other acts that bring success in these matters. 

One very noticeable feature is that the 7th mobile Karana called Visti appears to have inspired great terror in the minds of medieval writers on Dharmaśāstra. It will be noticed that dividing the lunar month into 60 halves of tithis, and beginning Bava on the second half of the pratipad of an amānta month, the Karana Visti will occur eight times in one month as the following diagram of the sixty halves will show:

In the dark half, 1124 Visti will occur in the latter half of the third and 10th tithis and in the first half of the 7th and 14th tithis; in the bright half Visti will occur in the latter half of the 4th and 11th tithis and the first half of the 8th and 15th (i. e. Paurnamāśi) tithis. The Rājamārtanda 1125 states. Some regard Visti as having the form of a cobra and as terrible; there is danger in the mouth of a snake but not in its tail. The mouth, neck, chest, navel region, waist and tail of Visti are respectively of five, one, eleven, four, six and three ghatikās. Great sages declare that it (Visti ) does not confer fortunate results, therefore a good man should avoid these except the tail' (on last three ghatikās of Visti auspicious acts may be performed). Visti is also euphemistically called Bhadrā or Kalyāni (it is really abhadrā). The terrible nature of Visti is described in two verses of Bhima-parākrama quoted in Bhujabala-nibandha p. 30 ( vide pp. 95–96 of my paper on ‘Bhoja and his works &c.' in Journal of Oriental Research, Madras, vol. XXIII for 1953-54 ) which also occur in Rājainārtanda, verses 1021-22. 

The whole scheme of Karanas is itself fanciful. But to draw a lurid picture of one of them, Visti (which occurs eight times in a month ), and say that it is like a cobra or an ogress is the height of imagination dominated by astrological considerations. 

Having described at some length the five angas in a pancānga, a few words must be said about Hindu calendars, though it has been already declared above that purely astro nomical matters will not be elaborated in this work. In the

Numerous pañcũngas in India 

711 

continent of India there are numerous pañcāngas in vogue and there is something like anarchy in this sphere. Hardly any two pancāngas agree completely. Many educated I ndians have been demanding that such matters as eclipses, the times of which can be noted by anyone, should be accurately predicted by the almanacs and that our ancient methods of calculating the motions of heavenly bodies should be brought in line with modern accurate calculations based upon observations. This is just what scientific astronomers like Varāhamihira would have done if they were living in modern times. At the end of his two works Varāha makes a very candid but solemn request 1126 

whatever in this work comes to be unscientific while it is being used or on account of defects in the mss, or whatever may have been badly executed by me or insufficiently done or not done at all, that should be corrected by learned men, leaving aside all passion / jealousy ), and after acquiring (knowledge ) from the lips of well-read mon.' Somne almanac-makers follow the Nautical Almanac tables as to eclipses and the like and set out other matters according to the old tables. As already stated there are three main schools of astronomers in India, (1) the school that follows the Sūrya-siddhānta (and is called Saurapaksa ), (2) the second follows the Brahma-siddhānta (and is called Brāhma paksa ), (3) the third follows the Āryasiddhānta (and is styled Āryapakşa ). There are two main points of difference between these, viz. (1) the length of the year, (2) the number of revolu tions of the sun, the moon and the planets in a certain period such as a mahāyuga. The difference in the length of the year among the siddhāntas is very small viz. a few vipilus ( a ripala being alth part of a vala, which again is oth of a ghatikā that is equal to 24 minutes). The length of the year according to the Sūryasiddhanta is 365 days 15 ghatis, 31. 523 palis, while the interval in time between two successive returns of the sun to the vernal equinox (called the tropical year) is only 365 days, 14 ghatis and 31. 972 palas and the correct sideral ( nāksatra) year is 365 days, 15 ghatis, 2 palas and 53 vipalas (vide C. R. C. Report p. 240 in hours, minutes and seconds and Dikshit's History ed. of 1931 pp. 159, 440). The result is that if one follows the Sūryasiddhānta, the starting point of Hindu astronomers is at present more than 23 degrees to the east of the correct vernal equinox point. This difference is called the ayanāṁsa.

As the longitudes of heavenly bodies reckoned from the equinox include these ayunāmsas they are called sāyana ( sa + ayana ). The places of heavenly bodies obtained by the methods of the Sūryasiddhanta and medieval Sanskrit works are distinguished by being called niruyana ( devoid of taking into account procession). At present according to most almanacs that employ the Sūryasiddhānta values Makarasankrānti (Sun's entrance into Capricorn) falls generally on 14th January, but according to the most accurate modern calculations, it should fall on 21st December; even in calendars that pride themselves on being suddha the Makarasankranti falls on 9th January i. e. our Makarasankrānti is celebrated 1127 about 23 or 18 days later than it should be and the same happens to the vernal equinox, autumnal equinox and the summer solstice and many other observances. Aśvini is still reckoned as the first naksatra (in which the vernal equinox is deemed to have occurred about saka 444 ), although the vernal equinox point has receded to the Uttara-bhādrapadā group of stars ( which should now be treated as the first naksatra). Efforts have been made by those familiar with the modern accurate calculations (such as the late Kero L. Chatre) to introduce modrn calculations in our almanacs; but they have met with little response. The late Lokamānya Tilak (who was a great Vedic scholar and mathematician) held several conferences of Indian astronomers and other interested people at Bombay (1904), Poona (1917) and at Sangli (1919). At the last conference several resolutions were passed which without making a total break with the past were calculated to reform our calendar and to prevent furthur deterioration. It is un necessary to set out all the resolutions, but the most impor tant were that the length of the year should be that of the Sūryasiddhānta but subject to necessary corrections, the rate of procession should be accepted at 50.2 ¿ikalās a year (as determined by modern astronomical observations ), that the Yogatārā 1128 of Revati (corresponding to Zeta Piscium of modern astronomers) should be deemed to be the beginning of the 

1127. Vide pote 574 above, where the encyclopoedist scholar Hemādri is quoted as saying that the real Makarsankranti takes place 12 days before the sankrānti in the almanacs and that the holy time of Makarsankranti is really twelve days earlier than the one on which people celebrate it and religious gifts should really be made at that time,

Zodiacal belt / rāśicakrārambhasthāna) and that the ayanāṁsas calculated from the starting point by actual observation should be accepted for the purpose of a new Karaņa (astronomical manual) to be compiled according to the resolutions. Unfortu nately the resolutions did not state where exactly the star Zeta Piscium was in a particular saka year. Dr. K. L. Daftari prepared a Karana-grantha called Karanakalpalatā in Sanskrit which was published in 1924. Almanacs based on its data have been published and are sometimes known as Tilak Pañcānga.' But it must be confessed that our people in general are so much custom-ridden that the popular response to the reformed calendar is poor. People still follow the pañcāngas based on the old siddhāntas. According to the śāstras every religious festival is to be celebrated at the proper time i. e. in the right season and on the proper tithi. The tithi depends upon the correct calcula tion of the movements of the moon, which are most difficult to reduce to rules that will give accurate results. Many people will not observe the ekādaśī fast if the eleventh tithi is mixed up with the 10th tithi even for a few ghatikās. But what guarantee is there that the 10th tithi has been accurately calculated? The ending moments of tithis do not agree with those given by the Nautical Almanac which are based on modern formula and are verified by actual observation. If tithis be calculated according to different Sanskrit astronomical treatises the moment of a particular tithi may differ by as much as five hours and the same festival (such as Kșspajanmāstami or Dussera ) may be celebrated on two successive days in the same city. 

Besides, it must not be forgotten that a pañcānga prepared on the basis of the latitude and longitude of Poona or Bombay will be slightly wrong oven at a distance of 30 or 40 miles to the west or east or north. It would be a great mistake from the religious point of view to employ & pancānga prepared on the basis of the longitude and latitude of Poona or Bombay in a place several hundred miles away (such as in Hyderabad or Aurangabad ). From the religious point of view if accuracy is to be preserved there must be a separate pañcānga for every town or overy place not more than 10 or 15 miles from places like Bombay or Poona where pañcāngas are at present prepared. 

In November 1952 the Government of India appointed a committee called the Calendar Reform Committee presided over by Dr. Meghanad Saha to examine all existing calendars being followed at present in India and to submit proposals for an accurate and uniform calendar for the whole of India. That 

9, D. 90 

714 

History of Dharmaśāstra 

(Sec. II, Ch. XIX 

committee submitted a very exhaustive and valuable report in November 1955. The final recommendations of the Committee for a civil calendar and for a religious calendar are set out on pp. 6-8 of the report. They are deserving of the most serious consideration by all who feel that religious observances must be done at the proper time and that now at least in independent India there should not only be one uniform civil calendar, but also one uniform Hindu religious calendar. 1129 It appears that unless Government makes great efforts for the introduction of a correct calendar even for religious purposes, it would be futile to assume that common people will spontaneously adopt a correct pancānga. 

Some of the important recommendations of the Committee may be set out here for the information of readers. 

Recommendations for civil calendar (1) The Saka era should be used in the unified national calendar. 

The Saka year 1876 corresponds to 1954–55 A. D. (2) The year should start from the day following the vernal 

equinox day. (3) Normal year is to consist of 365 days, while a leap year 

would have 366 days. After adding 78 to the Saka era year, if the sum is divisible by 4, then it would be a leap year. But when the sum becomes a multiple of 100, it would be a leap year only when it is divisible by 400; 

otherwise it would be a common year. (4) Caitra (or Chaitra as often written) should be the first 

month of the year and the lengths of the different months 

should be fixed as follows: Caitra - 30 days (31 days in a Āśvina - 30 days. 

leap year ). Vaišākha -31 days. 

Kārtika --30 days. Jyestha -31 days. 

Mārgaśīrsa - 30 days. Āsādha --- 31 days. 

Pausa —30 days. Srāvaņa--31 days. 

Māgha - 30 days. Bhadrapada – 31 days. 

Phālguna - 30 days. 

inny day 

1129. Those interested in Indian Calendar Reform should read the Marathi Preface to Dr. K, L, Daftari's work in Sanskrit 'Karana-kalpalatā', Mr. S.M. Karamalkar's Marathi work 'Kharen pañcanga kasem milel' (1950), I. H. Q. vol. IV. pp. 483-511 on 'Hindu Calendar' by Sukumar Ranjan Das, Dr. Saba's papers on 'Reform of Indian calendar' in Science and Culture' ( Calcutta, 1952), vol. XVII. pp. 57–68 and 109-123 and the Report of the Calendar Reform Committee. 

Calendar Committee's Recommendations 

715 

The dates of the reformed Indian calendar would thus have a permanent correspondence with the Gregorian 1130 calendar. The corresponding dates would be : 

Hindu Gregorian ! Caitra 1-March 22 in a Āśvina 1 - September 23. 

common year and 

21 in a leap year. Vaisākha 1 - April 21. 

Kārtika 1–October 23. Jyestha 1 - May 22. 

Mārgaśīrşa 1 - November 22. Āsādha 1—June 22. 

Pausa 1 - December 22. Srāvana 1 -- July 23. 

Māgha 1 - January 21. Bhādrapada 1 - August 23. Phālguna 1 - February 20. 

The Indian seasons would thus be permanently fixed with respect to the reformed Calendar as follows: 

Seasons : Grisma --- Vaisakha and Hemanta – Kārtika and (summer) Jýeştha. (late autumn) Mārgasirşa. Varsā -- Āsādha and Śiśira – Pausa and Māgha. (rains) Śrāvana. (winter) Sarad - Bhadrapada and Vasanta - Phālguna and (Autumn) Aśvina. (Spring ) Caitra. 

The States now having the solar calendars for civil and partly religious purposes which start the year from Vaišākha (April 14th ) will have to begin the year 23 days earlier, but the first month will be Caitra. The effect of this will be that in Bengal, Orissa and Assam solar months start approximately seven days later than now, and in Tamil-nad solar months start approximately 23 days earlier than now, for the month called Vaišākha (14th April to 14th May) in Bengal and Orissa is called Chittırai (or caitra) in Tamil-nad. Those who use the lunar calendar beginning with Caitra also for civil purposes would experience no great difficulty in adopting this unified calendar 

1130. It may be noted that under the Indian Limitation Act (Act I of 1908 ) section 25, all lostruments shall, for the purposses of the Limitation Act, be deamed to be made with reference to the Gregorian Calendar. This rule is absolute and therefore even if a bond is made on a titbl of a lanar month in a certain saka year and is made payable four months after the saka date, the period of limitation applicable to a suit brought on the bond runs from the expiration of four months after the date computed according to the Gregorian Calendar. 

716 

History of Dharmaśāstra (Sec. II, Ch. XIX 

as they have at present the beginning of their year on various dates from 15th March to 13th April and the first month is Caitra, 

Recommendations for religious calendar. (5) The calculation for Saura (solar) months necessary for determining the lunar months of the same name will start 23 degrees and 15 minutes (fixed ayanāmīa ) ahead of the vernal equinox point. This tallies with the present practice of most almanac-makers. 

The months would thus commence at the moments when the tropical longitude of the sun attains the following values; viz. Saura Vaišākha commences when the sun has the longitude of 23° 15', Saura Jyestha and the other Saura months upto Caitra will commence when the sun has respectively the longitude of 53° 15', 83° 15', 113° 15', 143° 15', 173° 15', 203° 15', 233° 15', 

263° 15', 293° 15', 323° 15', 353° 15'. 

This recommendation is to be regarded only as a measure of compromise, so that a violent break with the established practice would be avoided. But this compromise would not make our present seasons in the several months as they were in the days of Kālidāsa and Varāhmihira. It is hoped that at not a distant date, further reforms for locating the lunar and solar festivals in the seasons in which they were originally observed will be adopted 

(6) As usual the lunar months for religious purposes would commence from the moment of new moon and would be named after the saura month in which the new moon falls. If there be two new moons during the period of a Saura month the lunar month beginning from the first new moon is the adhika or mala māsa and the lunar month beginning from the moment of the second new moon is the suddha or nija māsa as usual. 

(7) The moment of the moon's exit from a naksatra division of 13° 20' each or sun's entry into it would be calculat ed with a variable ayanāṁsa ( i. e. on the supposition that they are fixed with respect to the stars ). The value of this ayanāmsa would amount to 23° 15' 0" on 21 March 1956. Thereafter it would gradually increases with the annual rate, the mean value of which is about 50.27". 

These arrangements would ensure that the religious obser vances determined by the sun such as the Visuva-sankranti, Uttarāyana-sankrānti and Daksiņāyana-sankranti would follow 

Calendar Committee's Recommendations

astronomically correct seasons, but those determined by the lunar calendar would continue to be observed in times conform ing to the present practica and the correction introduced by this report in the length of the year would prevent their further shift in relation to the seasons. 

The dates of festivals have already shifted by twenty-three days from the seasons in which they were observed about 1400 years ago as a result of our almanc-makers having ignored the precession of the equinoxes. Although it might appear to some desirable that the entire amount of shifting be wiped out at once, the authors of the Report consider it expedient to maintain this as constant difference and to stop its further increase. As a result there would at present be no deviation from the prevail ing custom in the obgervance of religious festivala. 

In the calculation of nakşatras, however, the Report has adopted a variable ayanāinsa, so that at the time of a particular naksatra the moon may be seen in the sky in the star or star group of that name. This practice has been followed in our country from Vedic times and is perfectly scientific. 

(8) The day should be reckoned from midnight to mid night of the central station ( 821 degrees E. Longitude and 239 11' North Latitude ) for civil purposes but for religious purposes the local sunrise system may be followed. 

(9) For the purpose of all calculations, the longitudes of the sun and the moon should be obtained by applying the most upto-date and complete equations of their motions, so that they may tally with their actually observed values. 

(10) Steps should be taken to compile an Indian Ephe meris and Nautical Almanac' by the Government of India, showing in advance the positions of the sun, the moon, the planets and other heavenly bodies. The Indian calendar, both civil and religious, prepared according to the above recommenda tions should be included in that publication every year. 

One can only express the hope that the above mentioned recommendations of the Committee of distinguished astronomers and Sanskrit scholars will receive a wide and hearty response from the Hindu people and that the present confusion and anarchy in the matter of religious observances in our country will come to an end as soon as possible. The Government of India accepted the principal recommendations of the Committee

(Sec. II, Ch. XIX 

by issuing a Press Note on 23rd October 1956 which decided that the Uniform National Calendar should be adopted with effect from March 22, 1957 corresponding to (Solar) Chaitra 1, 1879, Saka Era, for certain official purposes in conjunction with the Gregorian Calendar and laid down the steps to be taken by the Central Government and the States Governments for imple menting the decision. To avoid misunderstandings and to encou 

rage the use by the mass of the people of this Solar Calendar, Government has decided to make use of both the Gregorian Calendar and the New Indian Solar Calendar together in some Government business, such as publishing the Indian Government Gazette with both dates, the All India Radio Broadcasting news every day announcing both dates at the beginning. But Government is not going to give up as far as possible the practice of declaring public holidays on religious festivals according to the old Calendars. The Government will publish translations of the Calendar Reform Committee's Report in the principal languages of India. It must be said however that this Calendar does not remove all the defects of the Gregorian Calendar.1131 The years will still commence on different week days and the number of days in each month still varies. It is feared that this will add only one more calendar to the existing ones. 

1131. The Gregorian calendar now in general use in Europe and other parts of the world is irregular, unbalarred and inconvenient (vide pp. 643-44 above. ). For twenty-five years the World Calendar Association founded by Miss, Elisabeth Achelis in New York has been dedicatiog its time and resources to the introdution of the World Calendar in many lands. The outstanding features of this world calendar are : Every year is the same and begins on Sunday, 1st January and ends on Saturday: each of its four quarters has 91 days, 13 weeks or three inocths; January, April, July and October have 31 days each and the other months bavę 30 days each; the Calendar is stabilized and made perpet al by ending the year with a 365th day following 30th December each ye . This additional day is named W (it is a World Holiday) and equal to 31st December, Yo a leap year a day is added at the end of the 2nd quarter, is oamed w, ecuais 31 June, called Leap year day and is another World Holid * The Voited Nations Organi zation has not yet lent its support to the Wild Calendar. An interesting work is 'Time counts: the story of the Calendar. by Harold Watkios (London, 1954.)
