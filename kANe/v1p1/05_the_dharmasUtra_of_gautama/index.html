<ol start="5">
<li>The Dharmasutra of Gautama. This has been printed several times (there is Dr. Stenzler&rsquo;s edition of 1876, the Calcutta edition of 1876, the Ānanadāśrama edition with the commentary of Haradatta, and the Mysore Government edition with the bhāsya of Maskarin ; it was trans lated by Bühler in S. B. E., Vol. II. with an introduction). The Anandāśrama edition of 1910 which is incorrect in a few places (e. g. 21.7 ) has been used in this work. This dharmasūtra is, as we shall see, the oldest of those we have. The Gautama dharmasūtra was specially studied by followers of the Sāmaveda ( see note 55 above). The commentary on the Caranavyuha tells us that Gautama was one of the nine sub-divisions of the Rānāvanīya school of the Sāmaveda. A teacher Gautama is mentioned frequently in the Lātyāyanaśrautasūtra (. g. I. 3.3 and I. 4. 17 ) and in the Drāhyāyanaśrauta (e. g. I. 4. 17, IX. 3. 15 ) of the Sāmaveda. The Gobhilagphya (III. 10.6) which belongs to the Sāmaveda cites Gautama as an authority. There fore it is not improbable that a complete Gautamasutra embody ing Srauta, Grhya and Dharma doctrines once existed. There are other indications pointing to the close connection of the Gautamadharmasūtra with the Sāmaveda. Chapter 26 of the dharmasūtra about Krcchra penance is the same, almost word for word, as the Sāmavidhānas9 Brāhmaṇa (I. 2, Burnell&rsquo;s ed.). 59 There are, however, considerable divergences; e. g. tit. 17. 9. 26. 10-12</li>

<p>Among the purificatory texts (21 in number ) mentioned in Gau. Dh. S. (19.12 ) there are nine that are Sāmans. The mention of the five utterances (Vyāhrtis &lsquo;) &lsquo;resembles the number in the Vyāhṛtisāma60 though the order is different. It is, however, to be noted that Gautama is a generic name. In the Kathopaniṣad, both Naciketas (II. 4. 15, II. 5. 6 ) and his father (I. 1. 10 ) are styled Gautama. In the Chāndogyopanisad there is a teacher Hāridrumata Gautama (IV. 4.3).</p>
<p>Dr. Ram Gopal in his Ph. D. thesis ‘India of Vedic Kalpa sutras &lsquo;(1959) charges me (on p. 53 ) with being inconsistent as regards the Gautama-dharmasūtra. This book is probably his first serious work on ancient Sanskrit literature and society and I am afraid that he is more dogmatic in several conclusions of his than the facts warrant. About Gautama Dharmasūtra I made ( in the first edition of the H. of Dh. Vol. I published so far back as 1930 ) two points viz. (1) that it was originally an independent work and not attached to any particular Vedic Sākhā; (2) that it was subsequently adopted by Sāmavedins as their Dharmasūtra probably because it contained a few indi cations of leanings towards the Sāmaveda. I pointed out some of those indications, but also showed that Gautama&rsquo;s name was connected with the Kathas of the Krsna Yajurveda also, as in the Kathopaniṣad both Naciketas and his father are referred to as Gautama and because the Tantravārtika (about 650-700 A.D.) asserted that Gaut. Dh. S. was accepted or adopted by the Sāma vedins as their Dharmasūtra. I could have added many other matters in support of my theory but thought that it was unneces sary to do so. The duty of all scholars when dealing with ancient works or matters more than a thousand years old is to marshall the necessary or available facts with honesty and, if they do not all point to the same conclusion, to declare, if possible, one&rsquo;s</p>

<p>History of Dharmaśāstrat</p>
<p>opinion in favour of one probability as against another. There is no inconsistency in doing this and it is always possible that different scholars may hold widely divergent views about the age and other matters relating to a writer or work (particularly an ancient one ). I need cite only one example. The Artha śāstra of Kautilya has been available in print for half a century. There are hundreds of papers and books on various aspects of the Arthaśāstra. Yet on the question of the age of the Arthaśāstra depending on the same materials there are at least two divergent views, some scholars assigning it to 300 B. C. (Jacobi, Sham Shastry and Jayaswal), while others like Jolly and Winternitz bring down the work to 300 A. D.</p>
<p>Now that the charge of inconsistency has been made against me, I should like to say something more here. Gotama is a famous rsi in the Rgvoda. The name occurs at least eighteon timos in the Rgveda mantras and is employed in almost all cases (from nominative to vocative ). Rahugana Gotama is the rṣi of Rgveda I. 74-93 and the word Rabūganāh (plural) occurs in Rg. I. 78. 5. Nodha Gautama is the rsi of hymns 58-64 of Rgveda I and of hymn 88 of Rg. VIII. Nodhah (vocative ) occurs in Rg. I. 64. 1. Nodhāḥ Gotama occurs in Kg. I. 62.13 and Nodhāḥ (nom. sing.) in Rg. I. 61.14, I. 124. 4. Vāmadeva Gautama is the sage of almost all hymns in Rgveda-mandala IV (viz. hynins 1-41 and 45-48). In Rg. IV. 4. 11 Vāmadeva speaks of Gctama as his father. It is well-known that the verses of the Sāmaveda are taken from the Rgveda (except about 75). In the Index of the words in the Sāmaveda, prepared and published in the Nirnaya sagara Press by the Swamis Vishveshvarananda and Nityananda in 1908, the words Gotama, Gautama, Nodhas, Vāmadeva and Rahūgana do not occur at all. In the two Varśas attached to Br. Up. II. 6. 1 and IV, 6. %, the name of Gautama occurs thrice among the 60 generations or so from Brahman (n.) to Pautimāsya. It is rather renarkable that Svetaketu Āruṇeya&rsquo;s father is addressed as Gautama by Pravābapa Jaivali in Br. Up. VI. 2. 4-13. It may further be noted that in the daily turpana (satiating with water) of gods, sages and pitrs, ( as required by Manu II. 176 also ), the Āśv. Gș III. 1. 5. mentions several 60a</p>

It would be noticed that, though Jaimini is mentioned in it, Gautama is not.</p>
<p>As compared with the number of Srautasūtras and Gșhyasūtras of the Vedas there is a paucity of Dharmasūtras. It is well-known that at present there are only a few Vaidikas of the Sāmaveda in the whole of India and some large tracts of India, have no Vaidikas of Sāmaveda at all. Probably the Sāmavedin</p>
<p>Vaidikas must have been much less in numbers even in ancient and medieval times as compared with tha Vaidikas of the Rgveda and the Yajurveda. Even supposing that there was some Dharmasūtra of the Sāmaveda composed some centuries before Christ, gradually it inight have faded out and the small number of Sāmavedins that still existed in scattered parts of India adopted the Gautama Dharmasūtra which as shown above shows some Sāmaveda connections.</p>
<p>The Gautama Dharmasūtra appears to have been held in high esteem by Kumārila, as in his Tantravārtika he quotes or clearly refers to Gautama Dh. S. at least a dozen times, but quotes Āp. Dh. S. and Baudhāyana Dh. S. only a few times; vide the author&rsquo;s paper on Tantra-vārtika and Dharmaśāstra Works&rsquo; in JBBRAS, New Series Vol. I. (1925) pp. 95-102. Kumārila remarks that the two Sūtras (P. M. S.I. 3. 15-16 ) 600 deal with the question whether the ( several) Gșhyasūtras and Gautama and other (Dharmasūtras ) are restricted in application or are all embracing and then comes the passage set out in note 55 above, where after excluding Purānas, Mānava (i. e. the Manusmrti) and Itihāsa (i, e. Mahābhārata) he starts with Gautama as the first in enumerating the Dharmasūtras and remarks that Gautamiya (Dharmasūtra ) and Gobhiliya (i. e. Gobhila</p>

<p>Not only Kumārila but an earlier famous writer on Logic and Philosophy viz. Dharmakirti in his Nyāyabindu appears to suggest that Gautama was chief among the exponents of Dharmaśāstra.60c</p>
<p>Dr. Ram Gopal relies ( on p. 52 ) mainly on two circumsta nces, viz (1) that chapter 26 of Gaut. Dh. S. dealing with expiations called Kṛcchras is identical with Sāmavidhāna Br. I. % and argues that it is not unreasonable to assume that the Gautama-dharma-sūtra borrowed it from that Brāhmana; (2) that the majority of the purificatory texts prescribed in Gaut. Dh. S. (19. 13 ) belong to the Sāmaveda. I shall discuss the second point first. The relevant sūtra is set out in the note in transliteration and with explanations in some cases,60s</p>

<li>The Dharmasutra of Gautama</li>
</ol>
<p>The most important matter about this passage is that the whole of Gaut. Dh. S. chap. 19 (not merely one sūtra or sentence beginning with the word &lsquo;Upanisadah&rsquo;) is identical with Baud. Dh. S. III. 4 (except a few variations ) and also with Vas. Dh. S., Chap. 22 (except a few items). It may be argued that all three borrow from a common source and that such borrowing of a whole chapter cannot alter the character of the three sūtra works. We have to find that sourcs-that is all; but even if we find it, the Baud. Dh. S. still belongs to tha Krsna Yajurveda and Vas. Dh. S. is the Dh. S. for Rgvedins according to Kumā rila. In view of the fact that Baud. Dh. S. (I. 1.25 ) mentions Gautama&rsquo;s views as set out a little later it is most likely that Baud. Dh. borrows from Gaut. Dh. 8. the passage about expiations.</p>
<p>Dr. Ram Gopal is rather inaccurate when he says (p. 52) that the majority of the purificatory texts are from the Sāma. veda. Restricting oneself only to the number of texts specified ( which are 21 ) there are only ten texts that are Samavedic ( essentially nine only as Rathantara and Brhat are two conse cutive verses of the Sāmaveda, Pūrvāroika). But there are other important details of this sūtra that deserve consideration. The first purificatory text is Upaniṣads, which are enormous in extent as compared with the Saman texts and all the Vedic Samhitās are several thousand times more extensive than all the specified Sāmans. Therefore, this argument comes practically to nothing as proof of the assertion that the Gaut. Dh, S. was from the first affiliated to the Sāmaveda. The other argument about one chapter (26) being borrowed from Sāmavidhāna Br. leads nowhere. If the Baudhāyana Dh. S. oven after borrowing a chapter from another source, does not cease to be a sūtra of the Kr. Yajurveda, there is no reason why the same reasoning cannot hold good as to the Gaut. Dh. S. Dr. Ram Gopal refers (on p. 53 ) to passages from Lātyāyana (I. 3. 3, I. 4.7) and</p>

<p>Drāhyāyana (II. 3.15) Srautasūtras that speak of Gautama and from Gobhila Gr. (in III. 10.6 refers to Gautama&rsquo;s views on Astakā Śrāddhas ) and that certain sūtras of Gobhila Gr. agree closely with Gautama&rsquo;s (p. 53 and notes p. 56 ).</p>
<p>From these two circumstances it does not follow at all that Gautama (of the Dharmasūtra ) belonged to the Simaveda. That would be begging the question. Gobhila&rsquo;s is comparatively a rare name among ancient sages connected with Vedic Litera ture, while the name Gautamia is a very ancient one, has been closely connected with the Rgveda and the Krsna Yajurveda occurs in the tarpana for Rgvedins, is quoted by Ap. Ś. S. (I. 3. 33 ) and Baud. Dh. S. Therefore, one may say with good reason that Gobhila, Lātyāyana and others refer to or follow the views of Gautama, one of the most famous and ancient sages.</p>
<p>It should be noted that Gautama&rsquo;s views are mentioned twice in the Ās. S. S. The first passage refers to the controver sial question of śrāddha in honour of three paternal ancestors of a person when one or two of the three are alive. This subject has been dealt with in H. of Dh. Vol. IV pp. 511 ff. The author of Āś. Śr. S. in II. 6. 16-23 states the differing views of Gāṇagāri, Taulvali and Gautama, and states his own conclusions, Similarly, Āś. Śr. S. in V. 6. 22 refers to the view of Gautama that it is the hotr priest that first partakes of camasa oblations in the hott&rsquo;s vasatkāra. Āp. Śr. sūtra (I. 3. 11 ) refers to the view of Gautama. These passages may lead one to conjecture that Gautama had composed a srautasūtra also, which is not now available. We have many such instances where out of the three classes of the sūtras of a Vedic carana (viz. Srauta, Gșhya and Dharma ) often one or even two are wanting or not available. There is no Lātyāyana Gșhya nor Dharma sūtra, though Lātyā yana Śr. S. exists, there is the Gobhila G. S. and the Khādira Grhya sutra but no Gobhila or Khādira Ś. S. nor Dharmasūtra. We have Āśv. S. S. and G. S., Mānava Ś. S. and G. S., Drāhyā yana and Jaiminiya S. S. and Gr. S. but no Dharmasūtra belon ging to these caranas. In the case of Gautama, we may make several conjectures viz. that all three classes of sūtras composed by or attributed to Gautama once existed but two of them are now not available, or that Gautama Dharmasūtra was an inde pondent work or that the Gautama mentioned in some Srauta sūtras is different from the author of the Dharmasūtra One thing is clear that Gautama being a gotra name wa borne by</p>

<p>many persons from the times of the Rgveda and that some of such persons were Rgvedins. One solid fact is that Gautama&rsquo;s is the earliest of the extant Dharmasūtras (though some sūtras may be of doubtful authenticity ) and the view in the present state of our knowledge that his was an independent Dharmasūtra has the greatest probability. This view would explain why the Gaut. Dh. S., though the oldest of Dharmasūtras conforms with Panini&rsquo;s grammar far more than the Apastamba Dh. S. and Baud. Dh. S. do. The latter two, being a compact part of the Kalpasūtra and transmitted orally from one generation to another, retained many un-Pāṇinian forms while the Gaut. Dh. Ś. being originally unconnected with any definite school could be easily amended according to the requirements of those memorizing or reading it. Besides, there is no direct evidence before Kumārila that Gautama was adopted by the Sāmavedins and as to how many centuries before him.60 My view is that the author of Āpastamba Dh. S. was a southerner and wrote either at a time when Pāṇini&rsquo;s work was not composed at all or before it spread throughout India</p>
<p>Writers of Sūtras sometimes refer to or quote sūtras of other schools. For example, Gautama&rsquo;s view ( stated in XI. 20) is mentioned in the Baudhāyana Dh. S. I. 1, 25. Baud. Dh. 8. stated five differences in the usages of the peoples of the south and of the north, and states the view of some that a person (of one region ) if he followed the practice of another region would incur sin and that the custom in a country (southern or northern) would be authoritative in that country alone and notes that Gautama holds this latter view to be wrong. This establishes that Gautama Dh. S. came before Baud. Dh. S. (and before the earliest part of it. ). 631</p>

<p>According to Haradatta the dharmasūtra has 28 chapters. The Calcutta edition adds one chapter on Karmavipūka after chapter 19.

The following are briefly the contents of the Gautamadharmasūtra :-1. Sources of dharma, rules about interpretation of texts, time of Upanayana for the varnas, the appropriate girdle, deer skin, cloth and staff for each Varna, rules about sauca and ācamana, method of approaching the teacher; 2 rules about those not invested with sacred thread, rules for the brahmacūrin, control of pupils, period of study; 3 The four āśramas, the duties of brahmacūrin, bhikṣu, and vaikhūnasa; 4 rules about the house-holder, marriage, age at time of marriage. eight forms of marriage, sub-castes; 5 rules about sexual intercourse on marriage, the five great daily sacrifices, the rewards of gifts, inadhuparka, method of honouring guests of the several castes; 6 rules about showing respect to parents, relatives (male and female ) and teachers, rules of the road; 7 rules about the avocations of a brāhmaṇa, avocations for him in distress, what articles a brāhmaṇa could not sell or deal in; 8 the forty samskāras and the eight spiritual qualities (such as dayū, forbearance &amp;c.); 9 the observances for ā snataka and householder; 10 the peculiar duties of the four castes, the responsi bilities of the king, taxation, sources of ownership, treasure-trove, guardianship of minor&rsquo;s wealth; 11 Rājadharma, the qualities of the king&rsquo;s purohita ; 12 punishments for libel, abuse, assault, hurt, adultery and rape, theft in the case of the several varnas and rules about money-lending and usury and adverse possession, special privileges of brālmanas as to punishments; payment of debts, deposits; 13 rules about witnesses, falsehoods when excusable; 14 rules of impurity on birth and death; 15 Srāddha of five kinds, persons not fit to be invited at Śrāddha; 16 Upākarma, period of Vedic study in the year. holidays and occasions for them;17 rules about food allowed and forbidden to brāhmaṇas and other castes; 18 the duties of women, niyoga and its conditions, discussion about</p>

<p>The Gautama-dharmasūtra is written entirely in prose and it contains no verses either quoted or composed by the author him self, as is the case with the other harmasutrus. Here and there occur sitras that look like portions of Anustubh verses e.g. 23.2761. The language of Gautama agrees far more closely with the standard set up by Panini than the dlarmasūtras of Baudhāyana and Āpastamba. It is not very easy to account for this differ ence. It is obvious that commentators and generations of students that were brought up in the tradition of the Pāṇinean grammar tampered with the text and improved it in accordance with their notions of correct Sanskrit. But why this process should not have been carried out to the same extent in the case of Āpastamba it is difficult to say. A conjecture may be hazarded that the Āp. Dh. S. being a well-knit component of the Ap. Kulp and being studied as such was less liable to being tampered with than the Gautama Dh. S., which probably did not in its origin belong to any particular kalpi. The same commentator, Haradatta, explained both Gautama and Āpastamba. Haradatta, who, as will be seen later on, was a great grammarian, shows in several places that the current reading was ungrammatical from the Pāṇintan stand-point and that he preferred readings that were in consonance with Pānini&rsquo;s rulesha Thero are still a few un-Pāninean words, e. g. in 1. 14 (&lsquo;dvāvinnsateh for dvāvim</p>

A few sūtras quoted from Gautama in the Mitākṣarā (e. g. the sūtra &lsquo;utpatyaiva arthsvānitvam labhante), the Smṛticandrikā (dvyamsam vā pūrvajah syāt) and other works aro not found in the extant text. This fact along with the fact of an interpola tion of one chapter makes it clear that the present text of Gautama is of somewhat doubtful authority.</p>
<p>The literature known to the Gautama-dharmasūtra was extensive. Besides the Vedic sainhitās and Brāhmaṇas it mentions the following works; Upaniṣads (19. 13 ), the Vedāngas (8.5 and 11. 19), Vākovākya63a and Itihāsa (8.6.), Purāṇa (8.6 and 11.19),Up aveda (11.19), dharmaśāstra (11.19). That he borrows a chapter from the Sāmavidhāna-brāhmaṇa has been mentioned above. He borrows the first six sūtras of the 25th chapter from the Taittiriya Aranyaka ( 11. 18). The Sramanaka (in Gautama III. 26 ) is, according to Haradatta, the Vaikhānasa-śāstra (either composed by Vikhanas or treating of the dutios of hermits). Gautama refers to Ānvīkṣiki (11.3). The only teacher of dharma he quotes by name in Manu (in 21.7), who is cited for the proposition that there is no expiation for the three sins of brahmahatyā, drinking wine and violation of the bed of the yuru. Haradatta says that in the extant Manusmrti the same propo sitions are laid down about bra&rsquo;mahatya and surūpāna (in Manu 11. 89 and 146 respectively ), but that as to violation of guru talpa a passage from the Manusmrti has to be searched out (i. e. such a passage is not found there ). From this Bühler drew the conclusion that Gautama refers to the dharmasūtra attributed to Manu (and not to any versified Manu-smrti). But Bühler is not right in drawing this inference. In the first place in spite of what Haradatta says there are verses in the extant Manusmrti (XI. 104-105 ) which say that death is the expiation for violation of the guru&rsquo;s bed. In the second place, there is nothing to show, even if Haradatta were correct, that Gautama refers only to a dharnasūtra of Manu and not to a versified work. Besides Manu, Gautama frequently quotes certain views ascribed to the &lsquo;Acāryas&rsquo;</p>

<p>(0. g. III. 35, IV, 18). What teachers are meant by the word * Ācāryāḥ&rsquo;(which occurs in the Nirukta, in Kautilya and various other works ), it is difficult to say. Probably the word means &lsquo;the general traditional view of most writers in that particular śāstra on a particular point.&rsquo; Vide the author&rsquo;s paper on * The meaning of Ācāryāḥ&rsquo;in ABORI Vol 23 pp. 206-213. In numerous places Gautama refers to the views of his predecessors in the words .eke' (2. 15, 40 and 56, 3. 1, 4. 17, 7.23 &amp;c.) and &lsquo;okesām&rsquo; (28. 17 and 38 ). This proves that Gautama was preced-1 od by great literary activity in the sphere of dharmaśāstra. Gautama 11. 28 seems to be a reminiscence of the Nirukta (II. 3 )612</p>
<p>The earliest reference to Gautama as an author on dharma occurs in the Bauchāyanadharmasūtra. Baudhāyana discusses the authoritativeness of usages peculiar to the north or the south and quotes Gautama as saying that it is wrong to hold that certain customs must be held authoritative in certain countries (even though opposed to Vodic tradition and smrti). This refers to G. Dh. S. 11. 20. In another place Baudhāyana gives it as his view that a Brāhmana, if he cannot make a living by teaching, officiat ing as a priest or hy gifts, should earn his livelihood as a Ksatriya and quotes the views of Gautama as opposed to this65. The extant Gautama on the other hand teaches the same view as that of Baudhāyana66. Bühler made the plausible suggestion that the sūtra in the extant Gautama is an interpolation. Govindasvāmni, the commentator of Baudhayana, suggests that another Gautama is referred to by Baudhāyana. It is possible to suggest that in the Ms. of Gautama usod by Baudhāyana the sūtra about living as a Ksatriya did not occur and the next sūtra about living as a Vaisya alone occurred. Chapter 19 of the Gautamadharmasūtra which forms an introduction to prūyascittus in Gautama seems to have been borrowed wholesale by Baudhāyana (III. 10 ) with slight changes. That Baudhāyana borrows follows from the fact that the chapter in Baudhayana occurs in the middle of the discussion about prāyaścittas and not as an introduction, which is the case in Gautama. Baudhāyana treats of penances in several places (II. 1</p>

<p>III. 5. 10 and VI. 1.4). There are, besides, many sūtras in both Gautama and Baudhāyana that exhibit a close correspondence, e.g. Gautama III. 25-34 and Baudhāyana II. 6. 17 about Vaikhānasa, Gaut. 3. 3 and 35 and Baud. II. 6. 29, Gaut. 15. 29 and Baud. II. 8. 2, Gaut. 23. 8-10 and Baud. II. I. 12-14, Gaut. 24.2 and Baud. II. 3. 8. The Ap. Dh. S. II. 6. 15. 25 speaks of Smrti as laying down that up to upunayana there is no adhikūra for homa. This probably refers to Gautama II. 1-3. The Vasisthadharmasūtra also quotes the views of Gautama in two places ( 4. 35 and 37, impurity on death). The first refers to Gautama 14. 41 but the second cannot be traced in the extant Gautama. Chapter 22 of Vasistha is borrowed from the Gautamadharmasūtra, chapter 19. There are besides many sūtras that are the same or almost the same in Gautama and Vasistha, e. g. Gautama 3. 31-33 and Vas. 9. 1-3, Gaut. 3.26 and Vas. 9. 10, Gaut. 1, 44 and Vas.3. 37, Gaut. 1. 40 and Vas. 3. 38, Gaut. 1. 45-46 and Vas. 3. 48, Gaut. 1. 28 and Vas. 3. 49, Gaut. 14. 5-7 and Vas. 4. 24-26. Gautama is referred to in the Manusmrti (III. 16 ) as the son of Utathya. Gautama is one of the authors of dhurmaśīstras enumerated in Yājñavalkya (1.5). Aparārka quotes a verse from the Bhavisya purāna which speaks of Gautama&rsquo;s prohibition about drinking 67 Similarly, Kullūka (on Manu XI. 146 ) quotes a verse from the same Purāna which refers to Gautama 23. 2. Kumārila in his Tantravārtika quotes over a dozen sūtras from Gautama which present the same text as we have68. Gautama 11. 29 and 12. 4 are quoted by Samkara in his bhāṣya on Vedāntasūtra III. 1. 8 and 1.3.38 respectively. Viśvarūpa in his commentary on Yājñavalkya quotes numerous sūtras from Gautama. In Medhātihi&rsquo;s bhūsyn on Manu the writer more frequently quoted than any other is Gautama (e. g. on Manu II. 6, VIII. 125 &amp;c.).</p>
<p>The foregoing discussion about the literature known to the Gautama Dh. S. and the authors and works that mention Gautama or quote the dharmasūtra helps us in arriving at the approximate age of the dharmasūtra. He is separated by a long interval from the Sāmavidhāna Brāhmana. He is later than Yaska and wrote at a time when Panini&rsquo;s system was either not in existonce or had not attained a pre-ominent position. The extant text was known to Baudhāyana and Vasistha and was in the same state long before 700 A. D. The sūtra betrays no knowledge of the onslaught delivered on Brahma</p>

<p>nism by Buddha and his followers. He uses the term bhiksu (3. 10) instead of the term parivrājaka that occurs in Baudbā yana, Apastamba and other sutra works and lays down that a bhikṣu is to stay in one place in the rains, which reminds one of the Buddhist &lsquo;bhikkhu&rsquo; and &lsquo;Vasso &lsquo;. 68a Gautama cites the opinion of some that Yavana is the offspring of a Ksatriya male and a Sūdra female (4. 17). It is supposed by many scholars that the Yavanas became known to the Indians only at the time of Alexander&rsquo;s invasion and hence every work in which the word yavun occurs must be later than 320 B. C. Bühler (S. B. E. vol. II. Intro. LVI.) seems to suggest that the sūtra where the word Yavana occurs in Gautama may be an interpolation. This is not a satisfactory explanation.</p>
<p>Dr. Ram Gopal (on p. 54 ) finds fault with me for my criti cism of Dr. Bühler. Unfortunately, he appears to have not correctly grasped the situation. Gaut. Dh. S. 4. 17 (tebhya eva &hellip;paraśava-yavana-karana-śūdrāñ-sūdretyeke ) does not express Gautama&rsquo;s view but only states the view of some writers that if a sūdra woman has union with a brāhmana, a ksatriya, vaisya or a sūdra the child begotton would respectively be a Pāraśava, a Yavana, a Karana, a Sūdra. Bühlor tried to show that this was an interpolation. At the time when Bühler first wrote his intro duction to Vol. II. of the S. B. E. almost all Western writers regarded the occurrence of the word “Yavana&rsquo; in a Sanskrit work as enough ground for relegating it to 300 B. C. or to a later date. Bühler&rsquo;s words on p. LVI of the edition of 1879 (SBE Vol. II) are “ As there is no historical evidence to show that the Indians became acquainted with the Greeks before the invasion of Alexander in the 4th century B.C, it has been held that works containing the word Yavana cannot have been composed before 300 B. C.&rdquo; Then he refers to Gautama&rsquo;s text not being trust worthy and then to Rudradaman&rsquo;s inscription (vide E. I. Vol. VIII at p. 43 ) in which Tushāspa is described as Yavanarāja and asserts that Tushāspa was not a Greek but a Persian. Supposing Tushāspa had been a Persian there is no reason why he could not or might not have been called or described as Yavanarāja in Kathiawad in the 2nd century A. D. Vide H. of Dh. S. Vol. V. p. 516 note 743 where it is shown that Yavana is an exact reproduction of the word Ionian (from Ionia, which was originally</p>

Yauna Kamboja-Gandhārāḥ Kirāta Barbaraih saha) and Asoka in his 5th Rock Edict has &lsquo;Yona-Kāmboja-Gandhārānam.&rsquo; If Bühler had even then held the view which he sets forth in his Introduction in the second edition, he could have easily said in the Introduction to his first edition that even if the Sūtra in which the word &lsquo;Yavana&rsquo; occurs was not an interpolation, the date of Gautama need not be affected by the mere occurrence of the word &lsquo;Yavana &lsquo;in a sūtra that embodies the view of others. Bühler avoided in the Introduction to his first edition being definite about the age of Gautama owing to the word ' Yavana ' in Gautama, because he had not the courage at that time to differ from the current of western opinion. Dr. Ram Gopal in a research thesis shirks the important task of determining which sūtras of Gautama are spurious and yet devotos nearly one page to this. I had only the first edition in the library I used. It would liave been onough if he had simply said that Dr. Bühler later expressed his views about the occurrence of the word &lsquo;Yavana&rsquo; definitely in the Introduction to the 2nd edition, though he did not do so in the Introduction to the first edition.</p>
<p>One may ask, if Bühler bolieves that the Indians borrowed their alphabet centuries before Alexander from the neighbours of the Greeks, why it is improbable that the Indians may not have heard of the word Yavana centuries before Alexander and why Yavanas may not have resided in India long before that date. Taking all these things into consideration tho Gautama-dharmasūtra cannot be placed later than the period botwevn 600-400 B. C.</p>
<p>Haradatta wrote a learned commentary on the Gautama dharmasūtra called Mitāksarā. For an account vide sec. 87 below. In numerous places he quotes the explanations of other coin mentators of Gautama (e. g. 9. 53 ; 10. 12, 56, 66 ; 11. 17; 12. 32; 21, 9 &amp;c.)</p>
<p>· The Bhāsya of Maskarin, son of Vāmana, is a learned one. It has been published in Mysore Govt. Oriental Library Series. The Krtyakalpataru of Lakṣmidhara in its several parts refers to Maskarin e. g. on Gaut. Dh. S. III. 10-24 (anicayo bhikio&hellip; anārambhi ) the Moksakāṇda of Kalpataru quotes the points of Bhartçyajña, Asahāya, and Maskarin. The Naiyatakkekaya</p>

<p>mnentions in several pages the views of Maskarin on Gautama&rsquo;s sūtras (vide pp. 23, 248, 257). In the Gșhastharatnākara of Candeśvara (p. 330 ) ācārya Maskarin on Gaut. Dh. S. IX. 57 is mentioned. Therefore, it follows that the bhāsya of Maskarin is certainly not later than 1100 A. D. and may be assigned to the period 900-1100 A. D. This bhāsya is far more extensive than Haradatta&rsquo;s cuinmentary, and it is not unlikely that being much earlier has been made use of by Haradatta. But, as there were other early bhāsyas of Bhartryajña and Asahāya ( which are not yet available in print) it is difficult to say whether Haradatta borrows from the older ones or from Maskarin. For example, on Gaut. I. 6 (tulya-balavirodhe vikalpaḥ) the bhāsya extends to three printed pages. The same is the case with regard to Gaut. III. 1 ( bhāsya of four printed pages ), III. 11 (three printed pagos on anicayo bhiksuh) V. I. (ptāvupeyāt, three pagos ), IX. 1 (three pages ), XI. 29 (varna śramāh svasvadharma etc.), XXIII, 27 and 28 ( five pages on each ).686 Maskarin quotes profusely from at least thirty Smṛtis, some of them being both in prose and verse such as Uśanas, Kanva, Kātyāyana, Jātūkarnin, Paithinasi, Prajāpati, Bhārgava.

<p>The Mitāksarā, the Smṛticandrikā, Hemādri, Madhava and (ther writers quote a sloka-Gautama. Vide Parāśara-Madhaviya, vol. I, part I, p.7. Aparārka, Hemādri and Mādhava quote Vṛddha-Gautama, while the Dattakamimāṁsā (p. 72 ) quotes Vrddha-Gaut. and Brhad-Gaut. side by side on the same point. These are later works. Jīvānanda publishes a smrti of Vrddha Gautama in 22 chapters and about 1700 verses (part II, pp. 497 636 ), where it is said that Yudhisthira asked Krsna about the charias of the four castes. This smrti seems to have been originally taken from the Āývamedhikaparva of the Mahābhārata, as Mādhava and others cite verses occurring in it as from that parya ( vide Parāśaramadhaviya vol.
