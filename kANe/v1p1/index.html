<p>PREFACE</p>
<p>On November 17, 1962, the publication of the fifth and last Volume of Professor P. V. KANE&rsquo;s History of Dharmasastra was formally announced by Dr. S. RADHAKRISIINAN, and a significant landmark in the history of Indological research in this country may be said to have been thereby established. The Histury of Dhramuśīstru is a literary work which is. truly magnificent both in conception and execution. Its five Volumes, which together extend over nearly 6,500 pages, seek to present the most comprchensive treatment of the religious and civil law of ancient and medieval India. And, Professor KANE has accomplished this gigantic task single-handed incidentally, he has written down every word in the History in his own hand &ndash;and that too while he had been occupied with various other literary and public activities. As I have said on another occasion, for Professor KANE, the History of Dharma śāstra is the crowning glory of a life of great fulfilment, and, for the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, it is a matter of signal pride and honour to have been closely associ ated with that work.</p>
<p>The first Volume of the History of Dharmaśāstra was published in 1930. When the last Volume was published in 1962, the Institute felt that a second edition of the first Volume was manifestly called for. And this, for two reasons. For one thing, that Volume bad almost gone out of print. The second reason was academic in character. The first Volume needed to be revised and enlarged. Perhaps it was the only Volume of the History of Dharmagūstra which could have needed any revision at all. Though that Volume opened with an exhaustive theoretical discussion of the concept and sources of Dharma, its major part was devoted to a detailed history of the literature relating to Hindu Dharmaśāstre. Since the time of its publication, more than thirty-five years ago, quite a considerable amount of material had been publish ed in India and abroad about Dharmaśāstra literature. Some new texts had been brought to light or some new light and been sought to be thrown on the already known texts oksame of KANE&rsquo;s own bypotheses had been challenged. It had thug become necessary for the author to examine all this maleriet</p>
<p>FOUNDED</p>
<p>Preface critically and, on the basis of such examination, to modify or ratify or enlarge whatever he had already said on the subject.</p>
<p>However, when the last Volume of the History of Dharmasāstra was published in 1962, Professor Kane was already eighty-two years old, and the Institute was naturally hesitant to broach to him the subject of a revised edition of Volume I. But just a casual reference to it was more than enough - indeed, Professor KANE himself must have been thinking of such a revision &ndash; and he set out to work on a revised and enlarged edition of the first Volume with his usual assiduousness. In course of time, the printing was started in the Institute&rsquo;s own Press, but I must confess that the printer could not keep pace with the author. The revision also had grown far beyond the original estimate. It was, therefore, decided to publish the Volume in two parts, and the first part, containing nearly 600 pages, is now being issued on the occasion of the Golden Jubilee of the Institute. As for the second part, I can only say that Professor KANE has almost completed the revision of the entire Volume and the printing of the remaining portion is making steady progress.</p>

<p>HISTORY OF DHARMASĀSTRA,</p>
<ol>
<li>Meaning of Dharma</li>
</ol>
<p>Dharma is one of those Sanskrit words that defy all attempts at an exact rendering in English or any other tongue. That word has passed through several vicissitudes. The dictionaries set out various meanings of Dharma such as “ordinance, usage, duty, right, justice, morality, virtue, religion, good works, function or characteristic.&quot; Dharma is also personified as a doity, as in the well-known verse. Adityacandrāvanilosnalasca&hellip; dharmaśca jānāti narasya vṛttam'(Mahābhårata, Adi., chap. 74.16) or as in Manusmrti VIII. 16 .vřso hi bhagavān Dharmah' ( which also occurs in Sāntiparva 90.75 ). Vide H. of Dh. Vol. V (part 1) pp. 19-21 for the three words &ldquo;vrata', &lsquo;dharman&rsquo; and &lsquo;rta&rsquo; and JBBRAS. Vol. 29 (1954) pp. 1-28. In the hymns of the Rgveda the word appears to be used either as an adjective or a noun (in the form dlarman, generally neuter) and occurs at least about sixty times by itself (i. e, not preceded by a particle like vi or some words like satya), and about eighteen times in combination with a particle &lsquo;vi&rsquo; and with the words *sva' and &lsquo;satya&rsquo; fifty-six times therein. It is very difficult to say what the exact meaning of the word dharma was in the most ancient period of the Vodic language. The word is clearly derived from root dh? (to uphold, to support, to nourish ). In a few passages, the word appears to be used in the sense of up holder or supporter or sustainer' as in Rg. I. 187.11 and X. 92.22. In these two passages and in Rg. X. 21.33 the word dharma is clearly masculine. In all other cases, the word is either obviously in the neuter or presents a form which may be either masculine or neuter, In most cases the meaning of dharman is religious ordinances or rites &lsquo;as in Rg. I. 22. 18, V. 26. 6, VIII. 43. 24, IX. 64. 1 &amp;c. The refrain&rsquo;tani dharmāni prathamânyåsan&rsquo; occurs in Rg. I. 164. 43 and 50, X. 90. 16. Similarly, we have the words</p>
<p>prathamă dharmā' (the primeval or first ordinances) in Rg. III. 17. 1, and X. 56. 3 and the words &lsquo;sanată dharmāni (ancient</p>

<p>&quot;</p>
<p>U</p>
<p>ordinances ) occur in Rg. III. 3. 1. In some passages this sense of * religious rites&rsquo; would not suit the context, e. g. in IV. 53. 34, V. 63.75, VI. 70. 16, VII. 89. 57. In these passages the meaning seems to be &lsquo;fixed principles or rules of conduct&rsquo;. In the Vāja saneyasamhita the above senses of the word dharman are found, and in II. 3 and V. 27 we have the words &lsquo;dhruvena dharmaņā.&rsquo; In the same Samhita the form &lsquo;dharmaḥ&rsquo; (from dharma) becomes frequent, e. g. X. 29, XX. 9. The word &lsquo;Vidharman&rsquo;is froquently employed in the Rgveda viz. in the instrumental (in X. 46. 6), in the dative (in VIII. 7.5), in the locative in eight passages (I. 164. 36, III. 2. 3, VI. 71. 1, IX. 4. 9, IX. 64. 9, and IX. 86. 29-30, IX. 100.7) probably meaning Vidhāraņe) and in the vocative (in V. 17.2). It is difficult to assign a definite meaning to this word in all these passages. But from several passages where the word &lsquo;vidhartr&rsquo; is employed (which is derived from the same root dhệ with ri) it follows that vidharman probably means the same thing as vidhart; (in Rg. II. 28. 4, VII.7.5, VII. 41. 2, VII. 56. 24) applied to different gods. &ldquo;Svadharman&rsquo;as an epithet of Agni occurs in Rg. III. 21.2 and the word Satyadharman is applied to different gods alone viz. to Savity, Viśvedevāh, Agni and to Mitra and Varuna in I. 12 7, V. 51.2, V. 63. 1, X. 34. 8, X. 121. 9, X. 139. 3. In the case of this word the meaning appears to be whose regulations do not fail&rsquo;. The Atharvaveda contains many of those verses of the Rgveda in which the word dharman occurs, e. g. VI. 51.3 (acittyä сot tava dharmā yuyopima), VII, 5. 1 (Yajñena yajñamayajanta), VII. 27.5 (trini pada vicakrame ). In XI. 7. 17 the word &lsquo;dharmaḥ&rsquo; seems to be used in the sense of &lsquo;merit acquired by the porformance of religious rites.&rsquo; In the Aitareya-brāhmana, the word dharma seems to be used in an abstract sense”, viz. &lsquo;the whole body of religious duties&rsquo;.

<li>Meaning of Dharma</li>
</ol>
<p>Bșhadaranyaka Up. (I. 14. 14) treats Dharma and Satya as equivalent. In the Chandogya-upanişadlo (2.23) there is an important passage boaring on the meaning of the word dharmut. &lsquo;there are three branches of dluerna, ono is (constituted by sacrifice, study and charity (i. o. tho stago of house-holder ), the second ( is constitutod by ) austeritios (i. 0. the stage of being a hermit); the third is the brahmacūrin dwelling in the house of his teacher and making himself stay with the family of his teacher till the last; all these attain to the worlds of meritorious men; one who abides firmly in bruhman attains immortality.&rsquo; It will be seen that in this passage the word * dharmu' stands for the peculiar duties of the Wśramas. As the word brahmacūri itself occurs in this passage of the Chandogya, it is clearly indicated that this brief passage means to rofer only to the aśramas and their special duties. Prof. Hazra (in *Our Heritage' Vol. VII part I pp. 15-36, &lsquo;on the early meaning and scope of the word dharma&rsquo;) remarks (on p. 20 ) that the word Dharma as used in Vedic literature did not mean any act of vyavahára is shown definitely by this Chandogya passage (II. 23. 1). This is a strange (to put it mildly ) argument as one passage from an Upanisad (relating to only one small aspect of dharma ) cannot control the meaning of the word</p>
<p>Dharma' occurring hundrods of times in Samhitás, Brāhmanas and other Upanisads. Vide Br. Up. I. 4. 14, II, 5, 11 for the wide conception of Dharma (to cite only a fow Upanisad passages). The foregoing brief discussion establishes how the</p>
<p>ord dharma passed through several transitions of meaning nd how ultimately its most prominent significance came to be &lsquo;the privileges, duties and obligations of a man, his standard of conduct as a member of the Aryan community, as a member of one of the castes, as a person in a particular stage of life.&rsquo; It is in this sense that the word seems to be used in the well known exhortation to the pupil contained in the Taittiriya“</p>
<p>( Continued from lust puge ) Hicra Hara ( 97. V. 4. 124 ). Pāṇini employs the word dharma in some of his sūtras as in an atia (II. 4.4, wbich derives the word धार्मिक ), IV.4.92 (derives धर्म्य from धर्म), चरणेभ्यो धर्मवत् IV. 2. 46 ( derives words like $15 ti, 59172177), &lsquo;1tY ERIA&rsquo; (IV. 4. 47),</p>

<p>History of Dharmaśāstra</p>
<p>upanişad (I. 11 ) &lsquo;speak the truth, practise (your own) dharma &amp;c.&rsquo; It is in the same sense that the Bhagavadgitā uses the word dharma in the oft-quoted verse &ldquo;svadharme nidhanam śreyah' The word is employed in this sense in the dharma Šāstra literature. The Manusmrti (1.2) tells us that the sages requested Manu to impart instruction in the dluarmas of all the varņas. The Yājñavalkya-smrti (I. 1) employs it in the same sense. In the Tantra-vártikall also wo are told that all the dharmasūtras are concerned with imparting instruction in the dharmas of varṇas and ūsramas. Medhătithi commenting on Manu says that the expounders of smrtis dilate upon dharma as five-fold, e. g. varnadhirma, ūśrama-ılharma, wrnūsrama-dharma, naimittikadharma ( such as prāyaścitta) and gunadharma (the duty of a crowned king, whether Ksatriya or not, to protect).12 It may be noted that the Mitaksara on Yaj. I. 1 after mentioning the fivefold dharmas and illustrating them adds a sixth category viz. &ldquo;Sidhārana-dharma'- duties common to all men (including even candālas) such as ahimsã and quotes a vedic passage in support &lsquo;na himsyāt sarvā bhūtāni&rsquo;. Slightly differing enume rations of virtues to be cultivated by all men are found in Gaut. Dh. S. VIII. 23-25, Matsyapurāna 52. 8-10 (8 in all), Manu X. 63 (five), Yāj. I. 1. 22 (nine). Vide H. D. Vol. II pp. 10-11 and vol. V pp. 1023–24, 1637 and 1648. It may be noted that the Arthaśāstra of Kautilya (1. 3. 13) proscribes for all men ahimsā, satya, śauca, anasūyā, ānțsamsya and kşamā. It is in this sense that the word dharma will be taken in this work. Numerous topics are comprehended under the title dharmaśāstra, but in this work prominence will be given to works on ācāra and vyavahūra (law and administration of justice ).</p>
<p>11 &lsquo;parimetio quifquam eratara ' p. 237. 12 Go on il. 47. . 19.1 and Tile-775 on 2.25 give the same five.</p>
<p>fold classification. The Bhavisyapurana (in Brühma.parva 181, 10-15) sets out this fivefold dharma (Veok, Press ed.). The Gaut. Dh. 19. 1 Bays &lsquo;Ukto varnadharmaścăsramadharośca&rsquo; and then proceeds to dilate upon prāyaścittas (i. e, naimittika dharma). The Ap. Db. S. begins, *atbåtah Samayācārikan dharniān vyakhyāsyāmaḥ&rsquo; (We shall expound the dharmas relating to the practices based on convention and adds immediately that the conventions settled by those who are conversant with dharma and the authorities and not any and every corption whatever,' The Āp. Gr. S. begins &lsquo;Atba karmányadarsdani gshyante.&rsquo; That is actions are Srutilaksana and acāralakşam. Amma has several meanings as Amara says &lsquo;Samayðh sapatha matura siddhanta-samvidaḥ.&rdquo;</p>

<li>Meaning of Dharma</li>
</ol>
<p>It would be interesting to recall a few other definitions of dharma. Jaimini13 defines dharma as a desirable goal or result that is indicated by injunctive (Vodic) passages.&rsquo; The word dharma would mean such rites as aro conducive to happiness and are onjoined by Vedic passages. The Vaisosikasütral4 defines dharma as &lsquo;that from which results happiness and final beatitude.&rsquo; The Manusinști (in 11. 1) gives the following general definition of Dharma.14a &lsquo;Know Dharma to be that which is practised by the learned that lead a moral life, that are free from hatred and partiality, and that is accepted by their hearts (i. e. conscience ).&rsquo; Another similar definition is given by the Nitisara of Kāmandaka VI. 7 &lsquo;that is Dharma which when done is praised by äryas (respectable people) that are conversant with (the vedic) tradi tion and adharma is said to be that which such people consure&rsquo;. This is a versified rendering of Ap. Dh. S. I. 7. 20 yat-tu āryāḥ kriyamānam prašamsanti sa dharmo yadgarhante sosdharmaḥ.' There are several other more or less one-sided definitions of dharma such as &lsquo;ahimsā paramo dharmaḥ&rsquo;(Anušā sanaparva 115. 1.), &lsquo;ānrśamsyam paro dharmaḥ&rsquo; (Vanaparva 373. 76), &ldquo;ācārah paramo dharmah' (Manu I. 108). Hārīta defined dharma as srutipramānakals' (based on revelation). In the Buddhist sacred books the word dharina has several senses. It often means the whole teaching of Buddha ( S. B. E. Vol. X. p. XXXIII). Another meaning of dharma peculiar to the Buddhist system is an element of existence, i. e. of matter, mind and forces16.</p>

<ol start="2">
<li>Sources of Dharma The Gautamadharmasūtra?? says &lsquo;the Veda is the source of dharma and the tradition and practice of those that know it (the Veda ).&rsquo; So Äpastamba18 says the authority (for the dharmas ) is the consensus of those that know dharma and the Vedas.' Vide also the Vasisthadharma-sūtra 19 (I. 4-6). The Manusmộti20 lays down five different sources of dhurmu “the whole Veda is (the foremost) source of dharma and (next) the tradition and the practice of those that know it (the Veda); and further the usages of virtuous men and self-satisfaction.' Yájña valkya21 declares the sources in a similar strain the Veda, traditional lore, the usages of good men, what is agreeable to one&rsquo;s self and desire born of due deliberation-this is traditionally recognised as the source of dharma.' These passages make it clear that the principal sources of dharma were conceived to be the Vedas, the Smrtis, and customs. The Vedas do not contain</li>

<p>positive precepts (vidhis) on matters of dharma in a connected form; but they contain incidental references to various topics that fall under the domain of dharmaśāstra as conceived in later times. Such information to be gathered from the Vedic Litera ture is not quite as meagre as is commonly supposed. In another place22 I have brjught together about fifty Vedic passages that shed a flood of light on marriage, the forms of marriage, the different kinds of sons, adoption of a son, partition, inheritance, śrūddha, strīdhana. To take only a few examples. That brotherless maidens found it difficult to secure husbands is made clear by several Vedic passages. “Like ( a woman) growing old in her parents' house, I pray to thee as Bhaga from the seat common to al123. Vide also Rgveda I. 124, 7, IV. 5. 5 and Atharvaveda I. 17. 1 and Nirukta III. 4-5. These passages constitute the basis of the rules of the Dharmasūtras and the Yājñavalkya smrti against marrying a brotherless maiden24. This bar against marrying a brotherless maiden seems to have been due to the fear that such a girl might be an appointed daughter (putrikū) and that a son born of such a girl would be affiliated to his mother&rsquo;s father. This custom of putrikū is an ancient one and is alluded to in the Rgveda, according to Yāska25. Rgveda X. 85 is a very interesting hymn as regards marriage ; verses from it are used oven to this day in the marriage ritual.26 It shows that in the remote Vedic age the marriage rite resem bled in essence the Brāhma form as described in the Dharma sūtras and Manu.27 But the purchase of a bride (i. e. what is called Asura marriage in later literature ) was not unknown in the Vedic age. A passage of the Maitrāyaniyasainhitā ((I. 10. 11) is referred to in the Vasisthadharmasūtra28 in this con nection, viz. &ldquo;she who being purchased by the husband'. The</p>

<p>Gāndharva form is hinted at in the words29 .when a bride is fine looking and well adorned, she seeks by herself her friend among men'. The iniportance of the aurasa son was felteven in the remote Vedic ages. “Another ( person ) born of another&rsquo;s loins, though very pleasing, should not be taken, should not be even thought of (as to be taken in adoption30). The Taittiriya-samhita (VI. 3.10.5) propounds the well-known theory of the three debts31. The story of Sunaḥsepa in the Aitareya-brāhmaṇa (VII. 3) suggests that a son could be adopted oven when there was an aurasa son. The Taittiriya-samhita (VII. 1. 8. 1) tells the story of Atri who gavo an only son in adoption to Aurva. The Kşetraja son of the Dharmasūtras is often referred to in the earliest Vedio literaturo. &lsquo;What (sacrificer) invites you (Asvins) in his house to a bed as a widow does a brother-in-law or a young damsel her lover &lsquo;32. The Taittiriya-samhitā makes it clear that a father could distri bute his wealth among his sons during his own life-time, Manu divided his property among his sons&rsquo; &amp;c.33 Another passage of the same Sahitū seems to suggest that the eldest son took the whole of the father&rsquo;s wealth &lsquo;therefore people establish their eldest son with wealth &lsquo;34. Even in the Vedic ages the son excluded the daughter from inheritance&rsquo;a son born of the body does not give the paternal wealth to (his ) sister &lsquo;35. A passage of the Taitti riya-saṁhitā is relied upon by ancient and modern writers on dharmaśāstra for the exclusion of women in general from inheri tance: therefore women being destitute of strength take no portion and speak more weakly than even a low person36.

<p>eulogises the stago of studenthood and the Satapathabrahmana speaks of the duties of the Brahmacarin such as not partaking of wine and offering every evening a samich to fire37. The Taittirlya-samhita (VI. 2. 8.5) relates38 how Indra consigned Yatis to wolves (or dogs) and how Prajāpati prescribed a Prāya scitta for him. The Satapathabrāhmana speaks of the king and the learned brahmana as the upholders of the sacred ordinances.39 The Taittirlyasamhită says &lsquo;therefore the Sūdra is not fit for sacrifice&rsquo;.&rsquo; The Aitareya Brāhmaṇa tells us that when a king or other worthy guest comes, people offer a bull or a cowti. The Satapatha-brāhmana speaks of Vedic study as yajña and the Taittiriya-aranyakata enumerates the five yajnas, which are a prominent feature of the Manusmrti. The Rgveda eulogises the gifts of a cow, horses, gold and clothes43. Another passage of the Rgveda44 (thou art like a prapī in a desert) is relied upon by Sabara on Jaimini (I. 3. 2) and by Visvarupa on Yajnavalkya as ordaining the maintenance of prapūs (places where water is distributed to travellers). The Rgveda condemns the selfish</p>
<p>man who only caters for himself 45.</p>
<p>The foregoing brief discussion will make it clear that the later rules contained in the charmsūtras and other works on olurmuśāstra had their roots deep down in the most ancient Vodic tradition and that the authors of the dharmasūtras were quite justified in looking up to the Vedas as a source of dharma.</p>

<p>History of Dharmaśāstra</p>
<p>But, as said above, the Vedas do not profess to be formal treatises on dharma; they contain only disconnected statements on the various aspects of dharma ; we have to turn to the smrtis for a formal and connected treatment of the topics of the dharmaśāstra. Vide Prof. S. C. Bannerjee&rsquo;s &lsquo;Dharmasūtras, a Study&rsquo; pp. 514 533 for Vedic passages cited in major Dharmasūtras and pp. 533-539 for references to them by name or by initial word or words.</p>
<p>Before proceeding further a few preliminary remarks must be made. Ancient Sanskrit writers and modern historians of Sanskrit Literature divide ancient Sanskrit works into three groups, viz. the Vedic Samhitās (Rgveda, Yajurveda, Sama voda and Atharvaveda ), the Brāhmaṇas (including the early Upanişads like the Bșhadāraṇyaka). and Sūtras. The first two groups together constitute Veda or Śruti ( as Sabara says on P. M. S. II. 1. 33 &lsquo;Mantrās-ca Brāhmaṇam ca Vedah &lsquo;). Sūtras are not Veda, but many of thom are connected with the Veda and contain numerous mantras. Kalpa is one of the six auxiliary lores (angas) of the Voda and this group is generally later in time than the Brāhmanas, though some sūtra works appear to have been composed even in the times of the Tai. Är. II. 10 and of the Brhadārangakopanişad (II. 4.10 and IV. 5. 11). A distinction is drawn between Kalpa and Kalpasūtra by tho Tantravārtika.45a The word Kalpa (or rather Kalpasutra) is used in two senses, one comprehensive including tho aphoristic works on Vedic ritual, on the domestic ceremonies and also on law, government and administration of justice; the other sense covers only those aphoristic works that deal with Vedic sacrifices and matters related thereto. If the first sense is taken then Kalpasūtras are classified into three classes, viz. Srautasūtras that deal with solemn Vedic sacrifices, mentioned or discussed in the Vedas and Brāhmanas; (2) Grhyasūtras that deal with domestic ceremonies such as Upanayana, marriage and with daily and periodical rites and employ mantras for them mostly from one Sākhā of the Veda; (3) Dharmasūtras (also depending on the Vedas as the highest authority ) that treat of some of the topics dealt with in the Gșhyasūtras but add provisions on matters .concerning economic life, politics, government, civil and criminal law. A complete Kalpa in the first sense should cover all the three divisions. It is highly doubtful whether gxth Veda</p>

<p>Śåkhā had originally a complete set of the three kinds of works covered under the word Kalpa. This will be briefly dealt with a little below.</p>
<p>Recently (1959) Dr. Ram Gopal has brought out a large work on &lsquo;India of Vedic Kalpasūtras&rsquo; containing over five hundred closely printed pages. The title of the work is rather misleading. It does not deal with the Srautasūtras beyond very briefly stating what they contain and distinguishing their contents from those of the Gșhya and Dharmasūtras. His work is concerned only with the details gathered from the Gșhya and Dharınasūtras and he has nothing to say about the development of the several topics dealt with in these two classes during the long period of at least 2000 years after the sūtra period (which he places between 800 - 500 B. C. on p. 89). His work should have been entitled &ldquo;Indian Life as depicted in Gșhya and Dharmasūtras&rdquo;. As far as it goes it is a tolerable thesis, though rather prolix, dogmatic and over-disputatious. Having confined himself to the Gphya and Dharmasütras, it should have been his business to discuss all points concerning at least the principal Gļhya and Dharmasūtras. But he leaves important matters concerning several sūtras untouched. For example, on p. 54 he observes &lsquo;many sütras in the Gaut. Dh. S. appear to be of doubtful authenticity and it is an important task for future reseurchers to determine precisely the spurious sūtras interpolated in the original Dharmasūtra&rsquo;. One feels that he should himself have tackled that task at least about some representative Gșhya sūtras and the Gautama- dharma-sūtra ( which he places on p. 84 among the oldest class of Srauta, Grhya and Dharmasūtras and when on p. 82 he holds that Gautama is undoubtedly the oldest writer on Smārta Dharma) by a thorough examination of chapters and passages in them and should have pointed out the criteria why certain gūtras are held to be spurious and so forth. He need not have included in the thesis the description of the flora and fauna &amp;c. (pp. 103-109) or if he wanted to include these subjects he should have devoted more space. Nor was there any need for him to discuss (as he does on pp. 100-103 ) the varying limits of Aryavarta, since that subject had been dealt with at length by me in H. of Dh. Vol. II pp. 11-16. Ho hardly adds anything substantial to what I stated on that topic twenty two years ago. He could have referred to Vol. II of H. Dh, pp. 11-16 and added bits of information that did not getur therein.</p>

<li>When Dharmasastra works were first composed</li>
</ol>
<p>The important question is to find out when formal treatises on dharma began to be composed. It is not possible to give a definite answer to this question. The Nirukta (III. 4-5) shows that long before Yaska heated controversies had raged on various questions of inheritance, such as the exclusion of daughters by suns and the rights of the appointed daughter (putrikā ). It is very likely that these discussions had found their way in formal works and were not merely confined to the meetings of the learned. The manner in which Yaska writes suggests that he is referring to works in which certain Vedic verses had been cited in support of particular doctrines about inheritances. It is further a remarkable thing that in connection with the topic of inheritance Yāska quotes a verse, calls it a Sloka and distinguishes it from a ľk.47 This makes it probable that works dealing with topics of dharma existed either composed in the sloka metre or containing slokas. Scholars like Bichler would say that the verses were part of the floating mass of mnemonic verses, the existence of which he postulates without very convincing or cogent arguments in his Introduction to the Manusmrti (S. B. E. vol. 25 Intro.xc). If works dealing with topics of Tharmu oxisted before Yáska, a high</p>

<p>vol. 25, LXI ( footnote) for Buhler&rsquo;s view refuting Roto&rsquo;s opinion that</p>
<p>the whole discussion in the Nirukta is an interpolation, 47 तदेतहक्लोकाभ्यामभ्युक्तम्। अङ्गादकात्सम्भवसि&hellip;स जीव शरदः शतम् ।।</p>
<p>अविशेषेण पुत्राणादायोभवति धर्मतः। मिथुनानां विसर्गादो मनुः स्वायम्भुवोब्रवीत् ।।. The first half of the verse &lsquo;Aigād-angat&rsquo; occurs in. Br. Up. VI. 4.9 and in Kauşitaki Up. 2. 11 (three pädas) and the whole verse in Baud. Gs. and Aấv G§. and in mantra-patha II. 11. 33. The Māpavagrhyasutra (I. 18. 1) provides that the verse &lsquo;angad-angat,&rsquo; quoted io n. 47, was to be muttered over the son&rsquo;s head after the father returned from a journey. It may be noted that in the extant Manusmrti</p>
<p>Manuh SvāyambhuvoSbravīt&rsquo; occurs in IX. 158 and the words * Manurāha Prajāpatih&rsquo; occur in X. 78 and the words' tan-Manoranu. sasanam&rsquo;occur in VIII. 139 and 279 and in IX. 239. This shows that the śloka quoted by the Nirukta might have been contained in some Smrti work like the extant Manusmrti. Vide Manu IX. 133 and 139 for the underlying idea that there is no difference between the son&rsquo;s son and the daughter&rsquo;s son and therefore between sop and daughter.</p>
<p>As stated in Gautama, Manu, Yaj. and others, Srutt and Smrti are the most authoritative sources of Dharma and Manusmrti II. 10 states that Smsti Is Dbarmasastra. This last in a broad sense comprises the Gșhya and Dharmasūtras, metrical smstis like those of Mann. Yaj, Brhaspati, Parāśara, commentaries on them and digests | pibandhas).</p>

<p>13</p>
<p>antiquity will have to be predicated for them. The high antiquity of works on dharmaśāstru follows from other weighty considerations. It will be seen later on that the extant dharma sūtras of Gautama, Bauchāyana and Āpastamba certainly belong to the period between 600 to 300 B. C. Gautama 48 speaks of dharmaśāstras and the word dharmaśāstra occurs in Baudhāyana also (IV. 5.9). Baudhāyana speaks of a dharma pūthaka (I. i. 9.). Besides, Gautama quotes in numerous places the views of others in the words &lsquo;ityeke&rsquo; (e. g. II. 15, II, 58, III. 1, IV. 21, VII. 23). He refers to Manu&rdquo; in one place and to ' Ācāryas' in several places (III. 35, IV.18 ). Baudhāyana mentions by name several writers on dharma, viz. Aupajanghani, Kātya, Kāśyapa, Gautama, Maudgalya and Hārita. Apastamba also cites the views of numerous sages such as those of Eka, Kanva, Kautsa, Härita and others. There is a Vārtika which speaks of Dharmaśātraso. Jaimini speaks of the duties of a Sūdra as laid down in the dharmaśātrasi. Patañjali shows that in his days dharmasūtrus existed and that their authority was very high, being next to the coniniandments of Gods. He quotes</p>

<p>History of Dharmaśāstra</p>
<p>verses and dogmas that have their counterparts in the dharma sūtras52. The foregoing discussion establishes that works on the dharmaśāstra existed prior to Yāska or et least prior to the period 600-300 B. C. and in the 2nd century B. C. they had attained a position of suprenie authority in regulating the conduct of men.</p>
<p>In this book the whole of the extant literature on dharma will be dealt with as follows :-First come the dharmasūtras, some of which like those of Āpastamba, Hiranykesin and Baudhāyana form part of a larger Sūtra collection, while there are others like those of Gautama and Vasistha which do not form part of a larger collection; some dharmaxūtras like that of Visnu are, in their extant from, comparatively later in date than other sūlra works; some sūtru works like those of Sankha-Likhita and Paithinasi are known only from quotations. Then early metrical smộtis like those of Manu and Yājñavalkya will be taken up for discussion; then later versified smrtis like that of Närada ; there are many smộti works like those of Brhaspati and Kātyāyana that are known only from quotations. The two epics, the Maha bhārata and the Rāmāyana, and the Purānas also have played a great part in the development of the Dharmaśāstra. The commentaries on the smộtis, such as those of Viśvarūpa, Medha tithi, Vijñāeśvara, Aparārka, Haradatta will be next passed in review and then the digests on alarmu such as the works of Hemādri, Todaramalla, Nilakantha and others.</p>

<p>does not subscribe to the view of Max Müller (H. A. S. L. P. 68) and others that works in continuous Anustubh metre followed sūtra works 53. Our knowledge of the works of that period is so meagre that such a generalisation is most unjustifiable. Some works in the continuous sloka metre like the Manusmrti are certainly older than the Visnudharmasūtra and probably as old as, if not older than, the Vasisthadharmasūtra. One of the earliest extant dharmasūtras, that of Baudhāyana, contains long passages in the sloka metre, inany of which are quotations and even Āpastamba has a considerable number of verses in the śloka metre. This renders it highly probable that works in the śloka metro existed before them. Besides, a large literature on dharma existed in the days of A pastamba and Baudhayana which has not come down to us. In the absence of that literature</p>
<p>it is futile to dogmatise on such a point.</p>
<p>In volumes II to V both Srautasūtras and Gșhya-sūtras have been quoted and relied upon very frequently. In pp. 976-1255 of Volume II a comparatively full account was given of the Vedic sacrifices based on the Srautasūtras. But no account of the Grhyasūtras in general was given in any of the five volumes of the History of Dharmaśāstra. Therefore, a brief statement on the gļhyasūtras with references to some printed editions is set out below and no attempt will be made to settle their chronology. The chronology of the Dharmaśāstra given later on may be held applicable to the Gșhyasūtras also with some unimportant modi fications. The Gșhyasūtras often refer to the Srautasūtras of their schools e. g. the Āśv. Gr, begins&rsquo;uktāni vaitānikāni gļhyāni vāksyāmah&rsquo; (the Srauta sacrifices have been already expounded; we shall now expound the gļhya rites ). Vitāna means, acc. to Amarakośa, &lsquo;kratu &lsquo;(vedic sacrifice) and &lsquo;vistāra&rsquo;. Gșhya is derived from &lsquo;gļha&rsquo; (which means &lsquo;house or a shed&rsquo; or wife&rsquo; (&lsquo;gļhini gặhamucyate&rsquo; in Sānti-parva 144:6 Ch ed.).

<p>17, II. 2.5.4. refer to provisions in Āp. Gș. S. 53 a Similarly, a gļhyasūtra has often in view the Dharmasūtra of its carana; e. g. Āp. Gr. 8. 21. 1. (māsisraddhasyäparapakşe yathopadeśam kālāḥ ) has in view Āp. Dh. S. II. 7. 16. 4-21. It may be noted that Āp. Gr. IV. 11. 16-17 ( Pālāso dando&hellip;upadiśānti ) occur as Āp. Dh. S. I. 1. 2. 38. It may plausibly be argued that the extant Srauta, Gșhya and Dharmasūtras of certain caranas like those of Apastamba and Baudhayana were composed either by one and the same person or at least by father and son or grandfather and grandson and so on. But this would not be correct in the case of several Dharmasūtras.</p>
<p>The grhyasūtras belong to the various recensions of the four vedas The gļhyasūtras translated in volumes XXIX and XXX of the Sacred Books of the East Series are in order Sänkhåyana, Āśvalāyana, Pāraskara,:Khădira, Gobhila, Hiranyakešin, Āpasta mba. The Dharmasūtras translated in Sacred Books of the East Vol. II, VII and XIV are those of Āpastamba, Gautama, Vişnu, Vasistha and Baudhāyana. The gļhyasūtras belonging to the Rgveda are : (1) Āśvalāyana gr. s., published with Nārā yapa&rsquo;s commentary by Nir. Press and in B. I. Series and with Anāvilā of Haradatta in Tri. S. S. (1923). This Gr. S. belongs to the săkala Säkhã and the last verse in the Sākhā of the Rg. is * Samānīva ākūtiḥ&rsquo;; (2) The Sāňkhāyana Gę. S. (in six adhyāyas of which the last two appear to be later additions ) commented upon by Nārāyana and published in Indische Studion, Vol. XV. pp. 1-166, and by Dr. G. R. Sehgal with a learned Introduction (1960), New Delhi; (3) The Kauşitaka (often written as Kausitaki) Gr. S. edited by Mr. Ratna Gopal Bhatta (in the Benares S. Series, 1908 ) and by Dr. T. R. Chintamani, Madras, 1944 with the commentary of Bhavatrāta. These two belong to the Bāskala Sākhā of the Rgveda, the last verse of which &lsquo;is tac-cham yorāvsnimahe.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Yajurveda has two recensions Krsna and Sukla. The former has come down to us in four schools viz. Taittiriya, Maitrāyaniya, Kathaka and Kapisthala-katha. The number of Srauta and Gșhya-sūtras belonging to the Krsnayajurveda is large. The more important of the Gr. Sutras are (1) Baudha</p>

<p>History of Dharmaśāstra</p>
<p>to us. There is no dharmasūtra completing the Āśvalāyana Srauta and Gșhyasūtras; no Mānavadharmasūtra has yet come to light, though the Mānava Srauta and Gșhya sūtras are extant; in the same way we have the Sankhāyana Srauta and Grhya sūtras, but no sānkhāyanadharmasūtra. It is only in the case of the Āpastamba, Hiraṇyakeśin and Baudhāyana Sūtracarañas that we have a complete kalpa tradition with its three components of Srauta, Gșhya and Dharma sūtras. The Tantravārtika of Kumārila contains very interesting observations on this point. It tells us that Gautama (dharmasūtra) and Gobhila (gļhyasūtra) were studied by the Chandogas (Sāmavedins), Vasistha ( dharmasūtra ) by the Rgvedins, the dharmasūtra of Sankha Likhita by the followers of Vājasaneya-samhitā and the sutras of Āpastamba and Baudhāyana by the followers of the Taittiriya Śākhā55, The Tantravārtika (p. 179 ) establishes it as a sido dhānta (on Jaimini I. 3. 11 ) that all the dharina and grhyrı sutras are authoritative for all Aryan people. From this it appears that, although originally all sūtracarañas might not have possessed dharmasūtras composed by the founder of the carana or ascribed to him, yet gradually certain dharmasūtras were specially taken over or appropriated by certain carañas. As the dharmasülras were mostly concerned with rules about the conduct of men as members of the Aryan community and did not deal with ritual of any kind, all dharmasūtras gradually became authoritative in all schools.</p>
<p>The dharmasūtras were closely connected with the grhyasūtras in subjects and topics. Most of the Gșhyasūtras treat of the sacred domestic fire, the divisions of Gịhya sacrifices, the regular morning and evening oblations, sacrifices on now and full moon, sacrifices of cooked food, annual sacrifices, marriage, purnsavana, jātakarma, upanayana and other sarskūras, rules for students and snātuhas and holidays, śrāddha offerings, madhuparka. In most cases the Gșhyasūtras confine then solves principally to the various events of domestic life; they rarely give rules about the conduct of men, their rights, duties and responsi</p>

<p>bilities. The dharmasūtras also contain rules on some of the above topics such as marriage and the samskäras, rules for Brahmacarya and snätakas and holidays, on śrāddha and madhuparka. It is therefore not to be wondered at that in the Apastamba-gțhyasūtra the topics of the duties of the Brahmacārin and of the house-holder, of alithis and of śrūddha are meagrely treated as compared with the Āpastamba-dharmasūtra. The dharmasūtras very rarely describe the ritual of domestic life; they merely touch upon it; their scopo is wider and more ambi tious; their principal purpose is to dilate upon the rules of conduct. law and custom. Some sūtras are common to both the Āpast amba-grhya and the dharma sutra 56. Sometimes the grhyasūtra appears to refer to the dharmasūtra57. There are certain points which distinguish the dharmasūtras ( the more ancient of them at least ) from smrtis : (a) Many dharmasūtras are either parts of the Kalpa belonging to each sūtracarana or are intimately connected with the grhyasūtras. (b) The dharmasūtras some times betray some partiality in their Vedic quotations for the texts of that Veda to which they belong or in the caranas of which they are studied; (c) The authors of the older ) dharma sūtras do not claim to be inspired seers or superhuman being958. while the other smrtis such as those of Manu and Yājñavalkya are ascribed to Gods like Brahmā. (d) The dharmasutras are in prose or in mixed prose and verse; the other smrtis are in verse. (e) The language of the dharmasūtras is generally more archaic than that of the other smộtis. (f) The dharmasūtras do not proceed upon any orderly arrangement of topics, while tho other sirtis (even the oldest of them, viz. Manusmộti ) arrange their contents and treat of the subjects under three principal heads viz. ncūri, ryavahāra and prūyaścitta; (g) Most of the dharmasi tras are older than most of the other sınstis.</p>
<p>Many of the technical terms used in the Gșhyasūtras and Dharmasutras are derived from the Sainhitās, Brāhmanas and Srautasūtras e. g. the following few technical words which occur in the Gșhya and Dharma sūtras' are so derived and references</p>

The Āp. Dh. S. (I. 4. 12. 10 ) makes the interesting statement &ldquo;religious rites were declared in the Brāhmaṇas, the texts of those rites have been lost, (but those texts ) can be inferred from the actual per formance (of the rites that are in vogue): &ldquo;brāhmanoktā vidhayas teşām utsannāḥ pathāḥ prayogād-anumiyanto'. This shows that an early writer like Apastamba (who flourished some centuries before the Christian era ) was aware that Brāhmaṇa works had once described many of the gļhya rites, but that in his day such Brāhmaṇa texts had been lost.</p>

<li>The Dharmasutra of Gautama. This has been printed several times (there is Dr. Stenzler&rsquo;s edition of 1876, the Calcutta edition of 1876, the Ānanadāśrama edition with the commentary of Haradatta, and the Mysore Government edition with the bhāsya of Maskarin ; it was trans lated by Bühler in S. B. E., Vol. II. with an introduction). The Anandāśrama edition of 1910 which is incorrect in a few places (e. g. 21.7 ) has been used in this work. This dharmasūtra is, as we shall see, the oldest of those we have. The Gautama dharmasūtra was specially studied by followers of the Sāmaveda ( see note 55 above). The commentary on the Caranavyuha tells us that Gautama was one of the nine sub-divisions of the Rānāvanīya school of the Sāmaveda. A teacher Gautama is mentioned frequently in the Lātyāyanaśrautasūtra (. g. I. 3.3 and I. 4. 17 ) and in the Drähyāyanaśrauta (e. g. I. 4. 17, IX. 3. 15 ) of the Sāmaveda. The Gobhilagphya (III. 10.6) which belongs to the Sāmaveda cites Gautama as an authority. There fore it is not improbable that a complete Gautamasutra embody ing Srauta, Grhya and Dharma doctrines once existed. There are other indications pointing to the close connection of the Gautamadharmasūtra with the Sāmaveda. Chapter 26 of the dharmasūtra about Krcchra penance is the same, almost word for word, as the Sāmavidhānas9 Brāhmaṇa (I. 2, Burnell&rsquo;s ed.). 59 There are, however, considerable divergences; e. g. tit. 17. 9. 26. 10-12</li>

<p>Among the purificatory texts (21 in number ) mentioned in Gau. Dh. S. (19.12 ) there are nine that are Sämans. The mention of the five utterances (Vyährtis &lsquo;) &lsquo;resembles the number in the Vyāhịtisāma60 though the order is different. It is, however, to be noted that Gautama is a generic name. In the Kathopanişad, both Naciketas (II. 4. 15, II. 5. 6 ) and his father (I. 1. 10 ) are styled Gautama. In the Chāndogyopanisad there is a teacher Häridrumata Gautama (IV. 4.3).</p>
<p>Dr. Ram Gopal in his Ph. D. thesis ‘India of Vedic Kalpa sutras &lsquo;(1959) charges me (on p. 53 ) with being inconsistent as regards the Gautama-dharmasūtra. This book is probably his first serious work on ancient Sanskrit literature and society and I am afraid that he is more dogmatic in several conclusions of his than the facts warrant. About Gautama Dharmasūtra I made ( in the first edition of the H. of Dh. Vol. I published so far back as 1930 ) two points viz. (1) that it was originally an independent work and not attached to any particular Vedic Sākhā; (2) that it was subsequently adopted by Sāmavedins as their Dharmasūtra probably because it contained a few indi cations of leanings towards the Sāmaveda. I pointed out some of those indications, but also showed that Gautama&rsquo;s name was connected with the Kathas of the Krsna Yajurveda also, as in the Kathopanişad both Naciketas and his father are referred to as Gautama and because the Tantravārtika (about 650-700 A.D.) asserted that Gaut. Dh. S. was accepted or adopted by the Sāma vedins as their Dharmasūtra. I could have added many other matters in support of my theory but thought that it was unneces sary to do so. The duty of all scholars when dealing with ancient works or matters more than a thousand years old is to marshall the necessary or available facts with honesty and, if they do not all point to the same conclusion, to declare, if possible, one&rsquo;s</p>

<p>opinion in favour of one probability as against another. There is no inconsistency in doing this and it is always possible that different scholars may hold widely divergent views about the age and other matters relating to a writer or work (particularly an ancient one ). I need cite only one example. The Artha śāstra of Kautilya has been available in print for half a century. There are hundreds of papers and books on various aspects of the Arthaśāstra. Yet on the question of the age of the Arthaśāstra depending on the same materials there are at least two divergent views, some scholars assigning it to 300 B. C.

<p>Now that the charge of inconsistency has been made against me, I should like to say something more here. Gotama is a famous rsi in the Rgvoda. The name occurs at least eighteon timos in the Rgveda mantras and is employed in almost all cases (from nominative to vocative ). Rahugana Gotama is the rşi of Rgveda I. 74-93 and the word Rabūganāh (plural) occurs in Rg. I. 78. 5. Nodha Gautama is the rsi of hymns 58-64 of Rgveda I and of hymn 88 of Rg. VIII. Nodhah (vocative ) occurs in Rg. I. 64. 1. Nodhāḥ Gotama occurs in Kg. I. 62.13 and Nodhāḥ (nom. sing.) in Rg. I. 61.14, I. 124. 4. Vāmadeva Gautama is the sage of almost all hymns in Rgveda-mandala IV (viz. hynins 1-41 and 45-48). In Rg. IV. 4. 11 Vāmadeva speaks of Gctama as his father. It is well-known that the verses of the Sāmaveda are taken from the Rgveda (except about 75). In the Index of the words in the Sāmaveda, prepared and published in the Nirnaya sagara Press by the Swamis Vishveshvarananda and Nityananda in 1908, the words Gotama, Gautama, Nodhas, Vāmadeva and Rahügana do not occur at all. In the two Varšas attached to Br. Up. II. 6. 1 and IV, 6. %, the name of Gautama occurs thrice among the 60 generations or so from Brahman (n.) to Pautimāsya. It is rather renarkable that Svetaketu Āruņeya&rsquo;s father is addressed as Gautama by Pravābapa Jaivali in Br. Up. VI. 2. 4-13. It may further be noted that in the daily turpana (satiating with water) of gods, sages and pitrs, ( as required by Manu II. 176 also ), the Āśv. Gș III. 1. 5. mentions several 60a</p>

It would be noticed that, though Jaimini is mentioned in it, Gautama is not.</p>
<p>As compared with the number of Srautasūtras and Gșhyasūtras of the Vedas there is a paucity of Dharmasūtras. It is well-known that at present there are only a few Vaidikas of the Sāmaveda in the whole of India and some large tracts of India, have no Vaidikas of Sāmaveda at all. Probably the Sāmavedin</p>
<p>Vaidikas must have been much less in numbers even in ancient and medieval times as compared with tha Vaidikas of the Rgveda and the Yajurveda. Even supposing that there was some Dharmasūtra of the Sāmaveda composed some centuries before Christ, gradually it inight have faded out and the small number of Sāmavedins that still existed in scattered parts of India adopted the Gautama Dharmasūtra which as shown above shows some Sāmaveda connections.</p>
<p>The Gautama Dharmasūtra appears to have been held in high esteem by Kumārila, as in his Tantravārtika he quotes or clearly refers to Gautama Dh. S. at least a dozen times, but quotes Āp. Dh. S. and Baudhāyana Dh. S. only a few times; vide the author&rsquo;s paper on Tantra-vārtika and Dharmaśāstra Works&rsquo; in JBBRAS, New Series Vol. I. (1925) pp. 95-102. Kumārila remarks that the two Sūtras (P. M. S.I. 3. 15-16 ) 600 deal with the question whether the ( several) Gșhyasūtras and Gautama and other (Dharmasūtras ) are restricted in application or are all embracing and then comes the passage set out in note 55 above, where after excluding Purānas, Mānava (i. e. the Manusmrti) and Itihāsa (i, e. Mahābhārata) he starts with Gautama as the first in enumerating the Dharmasūtras and remarks that Gautamiya (Dharmasūtra ) and Gobhiliya (i. e. Gobhila</p>

<p>Not only Kumārila but an earlier famous writer on Logic and Philosophy viz. Dharmakirti in his Nyāyabindu appears to suggest that Gautama was chief among the exponents of Dharmaśāstra.60c</p>
<p>Dr. Ram Gopal relies ( on p. 52 ) mainly on two circumsta nces, viz (1) that chapter 26 of Gaut. Dh. S. dealing with expiations called Kệcchras is identical with Sāmavidhāna Br. I. % and argues that it is not unreasonable to assume that the Gautama-dharma-sūtra borrowed it from that Brāhmana; (2) that the majority of the purificatory texts prescribed in Gaut. Dh. S. (19. 13 ) belong to the Sāmaveda. I shall discuss the second point first. The relevant sūtra is set out in the note in transliteration and with explanations in some cases,60s</p>

<p>The most important matter about this passage is that the whole of Gaut. Dh. S. chap. 19 (not merely one sūtra or sentence beginning with the word &lsquo;Upanisadah&rsquo;) is identical with Baud. Dh. S. III. 4 (except a few variations ) and also with Vas. Dh. S., Chap. 22 (except a few items). It may be argued that all three borrow from a common source and that such borrowing of a whole chapter cannot alter the character of the three sūtra works. We have to find that sourcs-that is all; but even if we find it, the Baud. Dh. S. still belongs to tha Krsna Yajurveda and Vas. Dh. S. is the Dh. S. for Rgvedins according to Kumā rila. In view of the fact that Baud. Dh. S. (I. 1.25 ) mentions Gautama&rsquo;s views as set out a little later it is most likely that Baud. Dh. borrows from Gaut. Dh. 8. the passage about expiations.</p>
<p>Dr. Ram Gopal is rather inaccurate when he says (p. 52) that the majority of the purificatory texts are from the Sāma. veda. Restricting oneself only to the number of texts specified ( which are 21 ) there are only ten texts that are Samavedic ( essentially nine only as Rathantara and Brhat are two conse cutive verses of the Sāmaveda, Pūrvāroika). But there are other important details of this sūtra that deserve consideration. The first purificatory text is Upanişads, which are enormous in extent as compared with the Saman texts and all the Vedic Samhitās are several thousand times more extensive than all the specified Sämans. Therefore, this argument comes practically to nothing as proof of the assertion that the Gaut. Dh, S. was from the first affiliated to the Sāmaveda. The other argument about one chapter (26) being borrowed from Sämavidhāna Br. leads nowhere. If the Baudhāyana Dh. S. oven after borrowing a chapter from another source, does not cease to be a sūtra of the Kr. Yajurveda, there is no reason why the same reasoning cannot hold good as to the Gaut. Dh. S. Dr. Ram Gopal refers (on p. 53 ) to passages from Lātyāyana (I. 3. 3, I. 4.7) and</p>

<p>Drähyāyana (II. 3.15) Srautasūtras that speak of Gautama and from Gobhila Gr. (in III. 10.6 rəfers to Gautama&rsquo;s views on Astakā Śrāddhas ) and that certain sūtras of Gobhila Gr. agree closely with Gautama&rsquo;s (p. 53 and notes p. 56 ).</p>
<p>From these two circumstances it does not follow at all that Gautama (of the Dharmasūtra ) belonged to the Simaveda. That would be begging the question. Gobhila&rsquo;s is comparatively a rare name among ancient sages connected with Vedic Litera ture, while the name Gautamia is a very ancient one, has been closely connected with the Rgveda and the Krsna Yajurveda occurs in the tarpana for Rgvedins, is quoted by Ap. Ś. S. (I. 3. 33 ) and Baud. Dh. S. Therefore, one may say with good reason that Gobhila, Lätyāyana and others refer to or follow the views of Gautama, one of the most famous and ancient sages.</p>
<p>It should be noted that Gautama&rsquo;s views are mentioned twice in the Ās. S. S. The first passage refers to the controver sial question of śräddha in honour of three paternal ancestors of a person when one or two of the three are alive. This subject has been dealt with in H. of Dh. Vol. IV pp. 511 ff. The author of Āś. Śr. S. in II. 6. 16-23 states the differing views of Gāņagāri, Taulvali and Gautama, and states his own conclusions, Similarly, Āś. Śr. S. in V. 6. 22 refers to the view of Gautama that it is the hotr priest that first partakes of camasa oblations in the hott&rsquo;s vasatkāra. Āp. Śr. sūtra (I. 3. 11 ) refers to the view of Gautama. These passages may lead one to conjecture that Gautama had composed a srautasūtra also, which is not now available. We have many such instances where out of the three classes of the sūtras of a Vedic carana (viz. Srauta, Gșhya and Dharma ) often one or even two are wanting or not available. There is no Lātyāyana Gșhya nor Dharma sūtra, though Lātyā yana Śr. S. exists, there is the Gobhila G. S. and the Khădira Grhya sutra but no Gobhila or Khădira Ś. S. nor Dharmasūtra. We have Āśv. S. S. and G. S., Mānava Ś. S. and G. S., Drāhyā yana and Jaiminiya S. S. and Gr. S. but no Dharmasūtra belon ging to these caranas. In the case of Gautama, we may make several conjectures viz. that all three classes of sūtras composed by or attributed to Gautama once existed but two of them are now not available, or that Gautama Dharmasūtra was an inde pondent work or that the Gautama mentioned in some Srauta sūtras is different from the author of the Dharmasútra One thing is clear that Gautama being a gotra name wa borne by</p>

<p>many persons from the times of the Rgveda and that some of such persons were Rgvedins. One solid fact is that Gautama&rsquo;s is the earliest of the extant Dharmasūtras (though some sūtras may be of doubtful authenticity ) and the view in the present state of our knowledge that his was an independent Dharmasūtra has the greatest probability. This view would explain why the Gaut. Dh. S., though the oldest of Dharmasūtras conforms with Panini&rsquo;s grammar far more than the Apastamba Dh. S. and Baud. Dh. S. do. The latter two, being a compact part of the Kalpasūtra and transmitted orally from one generation to another, retained many un-Pāṇinian forms while the Gaut. Dh. Ś. being originally unconnected with any definite school could be easily amended according to the requirements of those memorizing or reading it. Besides, there is no direct evidence before Kumärila that Gautama was adopted by the Sāmavedins and as to how many centuries beforə him.60 My view is that the author of Āpastamba Dh. S. was a southerner and wrote either at a time when Pāņini&rsquo;s work was not composed at all or before it spread throughout India</p>
<p>Writers of Sūtras sometimes refer to or quote sūtras of other schools. For example, Gautama&rsquo;s view ( stated in XI. 20) is mentioned in the Baudhāyana Dh. S. I. 1, 25. Baud. Dh. 8. stated five differences in the usages of the peoples of the south and of the north, and states the view of some that a person (of one region ) if he followed the practice of another region would incur sin and that the custom in a country (southern or northern) would be authoritative in that country alone and notes that Gautama holds this latter view to be wrong. This establishes that Gautama Dh. S. came before Baud. Dh. S. (and before the earliest part of it. ). 631</p>

<p>According to Haradatta the dharmasūtra has 28 chapters. The Calcutta edition adds one chapter on Karmavipūka after chapter 19. In many places Gautama unmistakably refers to his own previous dicta; e. g. Yathoktam vã (23. 16 ) refers to 23. 10; 23. 26 refers to 17. 8-26; 17. 18 refers to 15. 18. The following are briefly the contents of the Gautamadharmasūtra :-1. Sources of dharma, rules about interpretation of texts, time of Upanayana for the varnas, the appropriate girdle, deer skin, cloth and staff for each Varna, rules about sauca and ācamana, method of approaching the teacher; 2 rules about those not invested with sacred thread, rules for the brahmacūrin, control of pupils, period of study; 3 The four āśramas, the duties of brahmacūrin, bhikṣu, and vaikhūnasa; 4 rules about the house-holder, marriage, age at time of marriage. eight forms of marriage, sub-castes; 5 rules about sexual intercourse on marriage, the five great daily sacrifices, the rewards of gifts, inadhuparka, method of honouring guests of the several castes; 6 rules about showing respect to parents, relatives (male and female ) and teachers, rules of the road; 7 rules about the avocations of a brāhmaṇa, avocations for him in distress, what articles a brāhmaṇa could not sell or deal in; 8 the forty samskäras and the eight spiritual qualities (such as dayū, forbearance &amp;c.); 9 the observances for å snataka and householder; 10 the peculiar duties of the four castes, the responsi bilities of the king, taxation, sources of ownership, treasure-trove, guardianship of minor&rsquo;s wealth; 11 Rājadharma, the qualities of the king&rsquo;s purohita ; 12 punishments for libel, abuse, assault, hurt, adultery and rape, theft in the case of the several varnas and rules about money-lending and usury and adverse possession, special privileges of brālmanas as to punishments; payment of debts, deposits; 13 rules about witnesses, falsehoods when excusable; 14 rules of impurity on birth and death; 15 Sräddha of five kinds, persons not fit to be invited at Śrāddha; 16 Upākarma, period of Vedic study in the year. holidays and occasions for them;17 rules about food allowed and forbidden to brāhmaṇas and other castes; 18 the duties of women, niyoga and its conditions, discussion about</p>

<p>The Gautama-dharmasūtra is written entirely in prose and it contains no verses either quoted or composed by the author him self, as is the case with the other harmasutrus. Here and there occur sitras that look like portions of Anustubh verses e.g. 23.2761. The language of Gautama agrees far more closely with the standard set up by Panini than the dlarmasūtras of Baudhāyana and Āpastamba. It is not very easy to account for this differ ence. It is obvious that commentators and generations of students that were brought up in the tradition of the Pāṇinean grammar tampered with the text and improved it in accordance with their notions of correct Sanskrit. But why this process should not have been carried out to the same extent in the case of Āpastamba it is difficult to say. A conjecture may be hazarded that the Āp. Dh. S. being a well-knit component of the Ap. Kulp and being studied as such was less liable to being tampered with than the Gautama Dh. S., which probably did not in its origin belong to any particular kalpi. The same commentator, Haradatta, explained both Gautama and Ãpastamba. Haradatta, who, as will be seen later on, was a great grammarian, shows in several places that the current reading was ungrammatical from the Pāṇintan stand-point and that he preferred readings that were in consonance with Pänini&rsquo;s rulesha Thero are still a few un-Påninean words, e. g. in 1. 14 (&lsquo;dvāvinnsateh for dvävim</p>

<p>śāt&rsquo;) and 9. 52 (kulamkula). The Tantravārtika (p. 99 ) appears to discuss the various readings in Gautama (I. 4563 ). A few sūtras quoted from Gautama in the Mitākṣarā (e. g. the sūtra &lsquo;utpatyaiva arthsvānitvam labhante), the Smộticandrikā (dvyamsam vā pūrvajah syāt) and other works aro not found in the extant text. This fact along with the fact of an interpola tion of one chapter makes it clear that the present text of Gautama is of somewhat doubtful authority.</p>
<p>The literature known to the Gautama-dharmasūtra was extensive. Besides the Vedic sainhitās and Brāhmaṇas it mentions the following works; Upanişads (19. 13 ), the Vedāngas (8.5 and 11. 19), Vākovākya63a and Itihāsa (8.6.), Purāņa (8.6 and 11.19),Up aveda (11.19), dharmaśāstra (11.19). That he borrows a chapter from the Sāmavidhāna-brāhmaṇa has been mentioned above. He borrows the first six sūtras of the 25th chapter from the Taittiriya Aranyaka ( 11. 18). The Sramanaka (in Gautama III. 26 ) is, according to Haradatta, the Vaikhānasa-śāstra (either composed by Vikhanas or treating of the dutios of hermits). Gautama refers to Ānvíkşiki (11.3). The only teacher of dharma he quotes by name in Manu (in 21.7), who is cited for the proposition that there is no expiation for the three sins of brahmahatyā, drinking wine and violation of the bed of the yuru. Haradatta says that in the extant Manusmrti the same propo sitions are laid down about bra&rsquo;mahatya and surūpāna (in Manu 11. 89 and 146 respectively ), but that as to violation of guru talpa a passage from the Manusmrti has to be searched out (i. e. such a passage is not found there ). From this Bühler drew the conclusion that Gautama refers to the dharmasūtra attributed to Manu (and not to any versified Manu-smrti). But Bühler is not right in drawing this inference. In the first place in spite of what Haradatta says there are verses in the extant Manusmrti (XI. 104-105 ) which say that death is the expiation for violation of the guru&rsquo;s bed. In the second place, there is nothing to show, even if Haradatta were correct, that Gautama refers only to a dharnasūtra of Manu and not to a versified work. Besides Manu, Gautama frequently quotes certain views ascribed to the &lsquo;Acāryas&rsquo;</p>

<li>The Dharmasutra of Gautama</li>

<p>(0. g. III. 35, IV, 18). What teachers are meant by the word * Ācāryāḥ&rsquo;(which occurs in the Nirukta, in Kautilya and various other works ), it is difficult to say. Probably the word means &lsquo;the general traditional view of most writers in that particular śāstra on a particular point.&rsquo; Vide the author&rsquo;s paper on * The meaning of Ācāryāḥ&rsquo;in ABORI Vol 23 pp. 206-213. In numerous places Gautama refers to the views of his predecessors in the words .eke' (2. 15, 40 and 56, 3. 1, 4. 17, 7.23 &amp;c.) and &lsquo;okesām&rsquo; (28. 17 and 38 ). This proves that Gautama was preced-1 od by great literary activity in the sphere of dharmaśāstra. Gautama 11. 28 seems to be a reminiscence of the Nirukta (II. 3 )612</p>
<p>The earliest reference to Gautama as an author on dharma occurs in the Bauchāyanadharmasūtra. Baudhāyana discusses the authoritativeness of usages peculiar to the north or the south and quotes Gautama as saying that it is wrong to hold that certain customs must be held authoritative in certain countries (even though opposed to Vodic tradition and smrti). This refers to G. Dh. S. 11. 20. In another place Baudhāyana gives it as his view that a Brāhmana, if he cannot make a living by teaching, officiat ing as a priest or hy gifts, should earn his livelihood as a Ksatriya and quotes the views of Gautama as opposed to this65. The extant Gautama on the other hand teaches the same view as that of Baudhāyana66. Bühler made the plausible suggestion that the sütra in the extant Gautama is an interpolation. Govindasvämni, the commentator of Baudhayana, suggests that another Gautama is referred to by Baudhāyana. It is possible to suggest that in the Ms. of Gautama usod by Baudhāyana the sūtra about living as a Ksatriya did not occur and the next sūtra about living as a Vaisya alone occurred. Chapter 19 of the Gautamadharmasūtra which forms an introduction to prüyascittus in Gautama seems to have been borrowed wholesale by Baudhāyana (III. 10 ) with slight changes. That Baudhāyana borrows follows from the fact that the chapter in Baudhayana occurs in the middle of the discussion about prāyaścittas and not as an introduction, which is the case in Gautama. Baudhāyana treats of penances in several places (II. 1</p>

<p>III. 5. 10 and VI. 1.4). There are, besides, many sūtras in both Gautama and Baudhāyana that exhibit a close correspondence, e.g. Gautama III. 25-34 and Baudhāyana II. 6. 17 about Vaikhānasa, Gaut. 3. 3 and 35 and Baud. II. 6. 29, Gaut. 15. 29 and Baud. II. 8. 2, Gaut. 23. 8-10 and Baud. II. I. 12-14, Gaut. 24.2 and Baud. II. 3. 8. The Ap. Dh. S. II. 6. 15. 25 speaks of Smrti as laying down that up to upunayana there is no adhikūra for homa. This probably refers to Gautama II. 1-3. The Vasisthadharmasūtra also quotes the views of Gautama in two places ( 4. 35 and 37, impurity on death). The first refers to Gautama 14. 41 but the second cannot be traced in the extant Gautama. Chapter 22 of Vasistha is borrowed from the Gautamadharmasūtra, chapter 19. There are besides many sūtras that are the same or almost the same in Gautama and Vasistha, e. g. Gautama 3. 31-33 and Vas. 9. 1-3, Gaut. 3.26 and Vas. 9. 10, Gaut. 1, 44 and Vas.3. 37, Gaut. 1. 40 and Vas. 3. 38, Gaut. 1. 45-46 and Vas. 3. 48, Gaut. 1. 28 and Vas. 3. 49, Gaut. 14. 5-7 and Vas. 4. 24-26. Gautama is referred to in the Manusmrti (III. 16 ) as the son of Utathya. Gautama is one of the authors of dhurmaśīstras enumerated in Yājñavalkya (1.5). Aparārka quotes a verse from the Bhavisya purāna which speaks of Gautama&rsquo;s prohibition about drinking 67 Similarly, Kullūka (on Manu XI. 146 ) quotes a verse from the same Purāna which refers to Gautama 23. 2. Kumārila in his Tantravārtika quotes over a dozen sūtras from Gautama which present the same text as we have68. Gautama 11. 29 and 12. 4 are quoted by Samkara in his bhäşya on Vedāntasūtra III. 1. 8 and 1.3.38 respectively. Višvarūpa in his commentary on Yājñavalkya quotes numerous sūtras from Gautama. In Medhätihi&rsquo;s bhūsyn on Manu the writer more frequently quoted than any other is Gautama (e. g. on Manu II. 6, VIII. 125 &amp;c.).</p>
<p>The foregoing discussion about the literature known to the Gautama Dh. S. and the authors and works that mention Gautama or quote the dharmasūtra helps us in arriving at the approximate age of the dharmasūtra. He is separated by a long interval from the Sāmavidhāna Brāhmana. He is later than Yaska and wrote at a time when Panini&rsquo;s system was either not in existonce or had not attained a pre-ominent position. The extant text was known to Baudhāyana and Vasistha and was in the same state long before 700 A. D. The sūtra betrays no knowledge of the onslaught delivered on Brahma</p>

<p>nism by Buddha and his followers. He uses the term bhiksu (3. 10) instead of the term parivrājaka that occurs in Baudbā yana, Apastamba and other sutra works and lays down that a bhikṣu is to stay in one place in the rains, which reminds one of the Buddhist &lsquo;bhikkhu&rsquo; and &lsquo;Vasso &lsquo;. 68a Gautama cites the opinion of some that Yavana is the offspring of a Ksatriya male and a Sūdra female (4. 17). It is supposed by many scholars that the Yavanas became known to the Indians only at the time of Alexander&rsquo;s invasion and hence every work in which the word yavun occurs must be later than 320 B. C. Bühler (S. B. E. vol. II. Intro. LVI.) seems to suggest that the sūtra where the word Yavana occurs in Gautama may be an interpolation. This is not a satisfactory explanation.</p>
<p>Dr. Ram Gopal (on p. 54 ) finds fault with me for my criti cism of Dr. Bühler. Unfortunately, he appears to have not correctly grasped the situation. Gaut. Dh. S. 4. 17 (tebhya eva &hellip;paraśava-yavana-karana-śüdrāñ-sūdretyeke ) does not express Gautama&rsquo;s view but only states the view of some writers that if a sūdra woman has union with a brāhmana, a ksatriya, vaisya or a sūdra the child begotton would respectively be a Pāraśava, a Yavana, a Karana, a Sūdra. Bühlor tried to show that this was an interpolation. At the time when Bühler first wrote his intro duction to Vol. II. of the S. B. E. almost all Western writers regarded the occurrence of the word “Yavana&rsquo; in a Sanskrit work as enough ground for relegating it to 300 B. C. or to a later date. Bühler&rsquo;s words on p. LVI of the edition of 1879 (SBE Vol. II) are “ As there is no historical evidence to show that the Indians became acquainted with the Greeks before the invasion of Alexander in the 4th century B.C, it has been held that works containing the word Yavana cannot have been composed before 300 B. C.&rdquo; Then he refers to Gautama&rsquo;s text not being trust worthy and then to Rudradaman&rsquo;s inscription (vide E. I. Vol. VIII at p. 43 ) in which Tushāspa is described as Yavanarāja and asserts that Tushāspa was not a Greek but a Persian. Supposing Tushāspa had been a Persian there is no reason why he could not or might not have been called or described as Yavanarāja in Kathiawad in the 2nd century A. D. Vide H. of Dh. S. Vol. V. p. 516 note 743 where it is shown that Yavana is an exact reproduction of the word Ionian (from Ionia, which was originally</p>

Yauna Kamboja-Gandhārāḥ Kirāta Barbaraih saha) and Asoka in his 5th Rock Edict has &lsquo;Yona-Kāmboja-Gandhārānam.&rsquo; If Bühler had even then held the view which he sets forth in his Introduction in the second edition, he could have easily said in the Introduction to his first edition that even if the Sūtra in which the word &lsquo;Yavana&rsquo; occurs was not an interpolation, the date of Gautama need not be affected by the mere occurrence of the word &lsquo;Yavana &lsquo;in a sútra that embodies the view of others. Bühler avoided in the Introduction to his first edition being definite about the age of Gautama owing to the word ' Yavana ' in Gautama, because he had not the courage at that time to differ from the current of western opinion. Dr. Ram Gopal in a research thesis shirks the important task of determining which sūtras of Gautama are spurious and yet devotos nearly one page to this. I had only the first edition in the library I used. It would liave been onough if he had simply said that Dr. Bühler later expressed his views about the occurrence of the word &lsquo;Yavana&rsquo; definitely in the Introduction to the 2nd edition, though he did not do so in the Introduction to the first edition.</p>
<p>One may ask, if Bühler bolieves that the Indians borrowed their alphabet centuries before Alexander from the neighbours of the Greeks, why it is improbable that the Indians may not have heard of the word Yavana centuries before Alexander and why Yavanas may not have resided in India long before that date. Taking all these things into consideration tho Gautama-dharmasūtra cannot be placed later than the period botwevn 600-400 B. C.</p>
<p>Haradatta wrote a learned commentary on the Gautama dharmasūtra called Mitāksarā. For an account vide sec. 87 below. In numerous places he quotes the explanations of other coin mentators of Gautama (e. g. 9. 53 ; 10. 12, 56, 66 ; 11. 17; 12. 32; 21, 9 &amp;c.)</p>
<p>· The Bhāsya of Maskarin, son of Vámana, is a learned one. It has been published in Mysore Govt. Oriental Library Series. The Krtyakalpataru of Lakşmidhara in its several parts refers to Maskarin e. g. on Gaut. Dh. S. III. 10-24 (anicayo bhikio&hellip; anārambhi ) the Moksakāņda of Kalpataru quotes the points of Bhartçyajña, Asahāya, and Maskarin. The Naiyatakkekaya</p>

<p>mnentions in several pages the views of Maskarin on Gautama&rsquo;s sūtras (vide pp. 23, 248, 257). In the Gșhastharatnākara of Candeśvara (p. 330 ) ācārya Maskarin on Gaut. Dh. S. IX. 57 is mentioned. Therefore, it follows that the bhāsya of Maskarin is certainly not later than 1100 A. D. and may be assigned to the period 900-1100 A. D. This bhāsya is far more extensive than Haradatta&rsquo;s cuinmentary, and it is not unlikely that being much earlier has been made use of by Haradatta. But, as there were other early bhāsyas of Bhartryajña and Asahāya ( which are not yet available in print) it is difficult to say whether Haradatta borrows from the older ones or from Maskarin. For example, on Gaut. I. 6 (tulya-balavirodhe vikalpaḥ) the bhāsya extends to three printed pages. The same is the case with regard to Gaut. III. 1 ( bhāsya of four printed pages ), III. 11 (three printed pagos on anicayo bhiksuh) V. I. (ptāvupeyāt, three pagos ), IX. 1 (three pages ), XI. 29 (varna śramāh svasvadharma etc.), XXIII, 27 and 28 ( five pages on each ).686 Maskarin quotes profusely from at least thirty Smộtis, some of them being both in prose and verse such as Ušanas, Kanva, Kātyāyana, Jātūkarnin, Paithinasi, Prajāpati, Bhārgava.

<p>The Baudhāyana Dharmasutra This has been edited several times (text by Dr. Hultzsch at Leipzig in 1884, text in the Anandāśrama collection of smrtis and in the Mysore Government Oriental Series in 1907 with the commentary of Govindasvāmin; translated in S. B. E., Vol. 14, with an Introduction). The Mysore edition has been used in this work. Baudhāyana is a teacher of the Krsnayajurveda. A complete set of the Baudhāyanasñtras has not yet been recovered and has not been as carefully preserved as the sūtras of Apa stamba and Hiranyakesin. Dr. Burnell arranges Baudhāyana&rsquo;s sütras into six sūtras, the Srautasütra in 19 praśnas (probably ); Karnāntasūtra in 20 adhyāyas ; Dvaidhasūtra in four prašnas ; Grhyasūtra in four praśnas ; Dharmasútra in four praśnas ; Sulvasūtra in three adhyāyas. The commentators offer no indi cation as to the place originally assigned to the grhya, dhurma and sulva sutras in the whole collection. Dr. Caland in his mono graph ( A. D. 1903 ) &lsquo;Uber das Rituelle sūtra des Bandhayana&rsquo; gives on p. 12 the contents of the Baudhāyanasūtra as follow: Praśnas I-XXI Śrauta, XXII-XXV Dvaidha, XXVI XVIII</p>

The Gșhyasūtra cites the view of Baudhāyana himself (1.7). The Baudhāyana-dharma refers to the Grhya and presuppose it in several places (vide note 54 ). In the Baudhāyanagļhya (III. 9. 6 ) we have a reference to pudakūra Ātroya, Vrttikāra Kaundinya, Pravacanakāra Kanva Bodhāyana, and Sūtrakāra Āpastamba. 68.8 A similar passsage occurs in the Blāradvāja Gșhyasūtra. In the Baudhāyana-dharma-sutra (II. 5.27 Rşitarpana ) we have Kanva Bodhāyana, Āpastamba sūtrakāra and Satyāsādha Hiranyakosin one after another. These references show that Kanva Bodhāyana was an ancient sage when the Baudhāyana-dharmasūtra was written and that he could not have been the author of the grhya or the dharma sūtras of Baudhāyana. Baudhāyana may have been a descen dant of this Kapva Bodhãyana. This surmise is supported by Govindasvāmin who explains Baudhāyana occurring in Baudhā yanadharinasūtra 1. 3. 13 as Kānvāyana. In the dharınasūtra Baudhāyana is hiinself cited as an authority several times ( 0. g. I. 4. 15 and 24, III, 5. 8, III. 6. 20). In all these places the</p>

<p>Mysore edition reads Bodhāyana, while the Anandáśrama reads</p>
<p>Baudhāyana. In one or two places he is styled &lsquo;bhagavān ( III. 6. 20). Several explanations are offered by the commen tator Govindasvāmin (on I. 3. 13). He says that it is the practice of the Ācāryas to refer to themselves in the third person (as Medhātithi says on Manu. 69 ) or that the author of the dharmasūtra is a pupil of Baudhāyana as the Manusmrti is promulgated by Bhrgu, the pupil of Manu, or there was some other Baudhāyana whose works have not come down to us.</p>
<p>Confusion results from the lists of sages in turpaņa mention ed in several Gșhyasūtras. The passage from Baudhāyana gp is quoted in note 68a. In that passage Kānva Bodhāyana is called &lsquo;pravacanakāra&rsquo; and Āpastamba is called &lsquo;sūtrakāra&rsquo;, while Satyāsādha, Hiraṇyakeśa, Vājasaneya, Yājñavalkya, Bhara dyāja and Agniveśya are merely named without any addition, In the Baud. Dh. 8. quoted in the saine note Kanva Baudhāyana (without the epithet &lsquo;pravacanakóra &lsquo;), Āpastamba sütrakāra and Satyāsādha Hiranyakešin are named. Two questions arise about the three names viz. (1) aro the sages mentioned in the tarpana passages the authors of the sūtra works in which they occur; ( % ) what is the import of the words pravacanakāra and sütrakāra applied to Kāņva Bodhāyana and Apastamba respe ctively and do those words suggest that Kāņva Bodhāyana is much earlier than Āpastamba. The present writer thinks that the authors of the Grhyasūtras were different from Kanva Bodhā yana and Apastamba to whom water is directed to be offered in the tarpaņa part of those works. They might be descendants of Kāņva Bodhāyana and Apastamba who are included in the sages for turpana.</p>
<p>If Kāņva Bodhāyana and Apastamba mentioned in the tarpapa passage were also the authors of the Bodhāyana and Āpastamba gphyasūtras it is very difficult to believe that they recommended to the generations that would come after them to offer water to them in tarpana.

<p>are entirely in verse. The style is quite different from that of the first two praśnas. The first five chapters of the fourth praśna dealing with prāyaścittas are more or less superfluous, the same gubject having been dealt with in II. 1. and III. 4-10. Some of the sütras in the earlier prašnas are repeated verbatim in the fourth, e. g. II, I, 33-34 and IV. 2. 10-11 (avaklıni-prāyascitta). The third praśnn also is not free from doubt. The tenth chapter of the third praśna is, as said above, taken from Gautama. The sixth chapter of the third praśna agrees very closely in phraseology with the 48th chapter of the Visnudharmasūtra. But it is rather difficult to say which is the borrower. Dr. Jolly (S. B. E. Vol. VII. p. XIX) is inclined to think that both borrowed from a common source. It seems more probable that Visnu borrows fronı Baudhiyana, as the Vişnudharmasūtra uses the form punita&rsquo; in place of &lsquo;punatha&rsquo; (in Baud.) and as the Vişnudharmasūtra omits all reference to Rudra ( Baud. III. 6. 12.) and omits the words &ldquo;ganān paśyati, ganādhipatim paśyati &hellip; bhagavān Bodhāyanaḥ&rdquo; (Baud. III. 6. 20.). In the Mysore edition all the four praśngs of the Dharmısūtra are divided into adhyāyas, but the Mss used by Bühler appear to have divided the first two praśnas into kandikās and the last two into adhyāyas. There are many repetitions even in the first two praśnas, which therefore make one rather doubtful about the authenticity of the first two praśnas also in their entirety. For example II. 6. 11 and 31 have identical; parts in II, 7 22 and II. 10.53 the same verse (&ldquo;astau grāsā&rdquo; &amp;c.) is quoted. Such repetitions are frequent in the two last praśnas e. g. III. 2. 16 and III, 3.23 ; III. 4. 5 and III.7. 12. Some of tho quotations ascribed to Baudhāyana in the Mitāksarā and other works ara not taken from the tharmasīlra, but from the Grhyasūtra or its supplements (e. g. the words &lsquo;ekām sākhāmadhite šrotriyah&rdquo; quoted in the Mit. on Yāj. III. 24 which are cited by Hultzsch (on p. 125), are taken from the Gșhya (vide note 78 below).</p>
<p>Though the fourth praśna appears to be interpolated, yet the interpolation must have taken place early enough. Višvarūpa on Yāj. I. 64 quotes Baud. Dh. S. IV. 1. 15-16 (trīni varşānyr tumati ) expressly as Baudhayana&rsquo;s and on Yāj. I. 72 quotes Baud. Dl. S. IV. 1. 22 (bhartuh pratinivesena &amp;c.) by name. The Mit, on Yāj. III. 305 quotes (as Baudhāyana&rsquo;s) a long passage, Baudh. Dh. S. IV. 1, 5-11. Sankarācārya on Br. Wo. IV.5. 15 quotes Baud. II. 10. % &ldquo;brahmacaryavan praxmati as smrti. Yāj.

<p>History of Dharmaśāstra</p>
<p>The Dharmasūtra of Baudhāyana is somewhat loose in structure and is not concise. Govindasvāmin remarks (on I. 2. 19) that Baudhāyana does not aim at brevity.70 Several subjects are treated of in two places and often without any logical connection with what precedes or follows. Rules of inheritance (dāya-bhäga ) occur in the midst of rules about prāgascitta (in II. 2.); rules about holidays (anadhyāya) occur immediately after the eight forms of marriage and the condemnation of the sale of a daugher (I. 11). Rules about snutaka occur in two places (1. 3 and II. 3. 10 ff.). Baudhāyana quotes at least 90 Verses introduced by the words &ldquo;athāpyudāharanti,&rdquo; more than 80 being from the first two praśnas alone. There are over two hundred other verses, about 80 of which occur in the first two praśnas and about ten are Vedic. Some of the verses even in the first two praśnas do not appear to be quotations e. g. I. 1. 16, II. 2. 1. II. 3. 50, II. 3. 52-54 and 56. A verse quoted is in the Vamsastha metre (IV. 3. 14); there are two verses in the Upajāti metre taken as a quotation (II. 3. 18). There are some prose quota tions introduced with the words &ldquo;athāpyudāharanti&rdquo; (e. g. II. 4. 5 and II. 6. 30 which refers to the asura Kapila son of Prahlada ). The language of the Baud. Dh. 8. is archaic and often departs from the Pāṇinean standard. Baudhāyana employs such un Páninean forms as “gphya&rdquo; (for gļhityā in II. 5. 1), pūjya (II. 9. 5.), &ldquo;adhigacchānaḥ&rdquo; (in II. 9.9.), ānayitvā (III. 3. 6), &ldquo;punatha &quot; (in III, 6. 5, probably a quotation,), &ldquo;tebhiḥ&rdquo; (for taiḥ in III. 2. 16, a quotation). In several places Baudhāyana states opposite views and then gives his own opinion on the point, e. g. Baud. I. 5. 105-109 (about impurity on birth); II. 1. 49-51.</p>
<p>As regards the literature known to Baudhāyana the following points may be noted. All the four Vedas are mentioned by name in II. 5. 27 ( tarpana ). He quotes very frequently the Taittiriya Samhitā, Tai. Brāhmana and the Tai. Āranyaka (in the Andhra recension). Well-known hymns of the Rgveda such as the Aghamarşaņa, the Purusasūkta and also simple .rks&rsquo; are frequently referred to. In III. 10 ( which is almost the same as Gautama 19 ) there is a sūtra enumerating the Upanişads, the Samhitas of all the Vedas and several sūmans as purificatory texts. There are long quotations taken from the Satapatha brāhmaṇa (XI. 3. 3.1 ff and XI. 5. 6.3) in Baud. (1. 2. 52 about</p>

<p>brahmacūri and II. 6. 7-9 about brahmayajňı). It is noteworthy that in the tarpana there is an invocation of the Atharyaveda and immediately afterwards of the Atharvāngirasah. The same is found in the Baudhāyanagļhya also (III. 2.9 and 22 ). In the Upanişads (Brhadaranyaka II. 4. 10, 1V. 1. 2) it is the word Atharvāngirasaḥ that stands for the Atharvaveda. Baudhāyana quotes a gāthā of the Bhāllavins (I. 1. 29 ) about the geographical limits of Aryavarta. Vasistha adduces the same verso (I. 15 ) and says that it is taken froin the Nidāna work of the Bhāllavins. The Nirukta also mentions a school of Vedic interpretation called Naidānāh. It is difficult to say what Nidāna works contained. Itihūsa and Purana occur in the tarpaņu (II. 5. 27). The angas of the Vedas occur in I. 1.8 and the six anyas in 11. 8. 2. Whether the word &ldquo;rahasya” in II. 8. 3 means the Āranyakas (as Govindasvāmin explains ) is doubtful. Baudhāyana mentions a Vaikhānasa-śāstra in II. 6. 16, which appears to refer to the work of Vikhanas on hermits and speaks of Srāmayaka (the rites prescribed by Vikhanas for initiation as hermit), just as Gautama does. Among the authors on dharma mentioned by name are : Aupajanghani ( II. 2. 33 for the view that only aurasa son was to be recognised and not the other kinds of sons71), Kātya (1.2. 47), Kaśyapa (or Kāśyapa in other editions, I. 11. 20 on the point that a woman bought cannot be a patnī), Gautama (I. 1. 23 and II. 2. 70 ), Prajapati (II, 4. 15 about failure in Sandhyopāsana, and II. 10. 71 about sannyūsa), Manu (IV. 1. 14 and IV. 2. 16), Maudgalya (II. 2. 61, about observances of a widow being restricted only to six months after her husband&rsquo;s death), Harita (II. 1. 50). Baud. I. 2.7 quotes a verse, which Vasistha ascribes to Hārīta (Vas. II. 6). As to Gautama, vide p. 33 above. Manu is only mentioned in the fourth praśna, the authenticity of which, as said above, is very doubtful. Baudhāyana II. 2. 16 ( about the efficacy of Aglumarşaņa) closely agrees with Manu XI. 260. The first reference to Manu&rsquo;s teaching cannot be traced in the Manusmrti. Prajāpati ( in III. 9. 21 ) seems to stand for god Brahmā and not for any real or mythical writor on dharma. One remarkable piece of information contained in Baudhāyana (II. 6. 30 ) is that he quotes from a work (of the Brāhmana class in language ) a prose passage wherein the division into four aśramas is ascribed to an asura Kapila, son of Pralhāda. In II. 2.79 Baudhāyana quotes a gūthū from the dialogue between the</p>

<p>daughter of Ušanas and the king Vrsaparvan, which is nearly the same as Mahābhārata I. 78. 10 and 34. Baud. quotes the view of Ācāryas (II. 6. 29 ) as Gautama does. In several places he refers to the views of his predecessors on dharma as “others&rdquo; (eke, apare ) e. g. I. 4. 23, 1. 5. 16, I. 6. 105-106, II. 5. 2. In II, 3. 18 two verses in the Upajāti metre are quoted as sung by &ldquo;anna&rdquo; (food). From the numerous quotations in verse cited by Baudhāyana on topics of dharma, it follows that the Dharmasūtra was preceded by a considerable number of works on dharma in verse. Bühler (SBE vol. XIV, p. XLIII) says that Vijñāneśvara was the first writer who quoted the Baud. D. S. But there are writers who flourished centuries before Vijñāneśvara that regarded Baudhāyana as a writer on dharma and either quoted his words or pointedly referred to them. Sabara in his bhūsya on Jaimini I. 3. 3 says that the rule in the Smộtis about the period of Vedic study being 48 years is opposed to the Vedic injunction &ldquo;one who has begot sons and whose hair are dark should consecrate the sacrificial fires73.” This must be regarded as referring to the words of Baudhāyana (I. 2.1). Sabara uses the same word “Vedabrahmacarya&rdquo; that Baud. employs. It is true that Gautama and Āpastamba both refer to the rule about 48 years, but they do not employ the word &ldquo;veda-brahmacarya.&rdquo; The Tantravārtika7 of Kumārila says that the words of Āpastamba (II. 6. 15. 1) which seem to accept the validity of local and family usages (even though opposed to Smộti tradition) stand refuted by the words of Baudhāyana (I. 1. 19-24 ) who cites only such censured usages as are opposed to Snirti. Kumärila appears to think that Baudhāyana attacks the extant work of Äpastamba, i. e, the present Baud. is later than the present Āpastamba. It is not necessary to follow Kumārila implicitly as regards chronological details, where he is speaking of writers that flourished over a thous and years before him. But his opinion deserves weight.

<p>The Baulhāyana Dharmasūtra</p>
<p>vårtika quotes a Smrti passage which bears a close resemblance to Baudhāyana (II. 3. 28). In the commentary of Višvarūpa (who as we shall see below flourished about 800 A. D.)on Yājñavalkya, Baudhāyana is quoted at least nine times in the chapter on īcūra alone. Vide Višvarūpa on Yāj. I. 21, 26, 29,53, 64, 69, 72, 79, 195 (Trivandrum edition), where Baud. I. 5. 14, I. 2.30, , 5.5, 1. 1. 17, IV.1. 15, 1V. 1. 18, 1V. 1.22, IV. 1. 20 and I. 5. 47 are respecti vely quoted. There are very few variations from the present text and the only serious variation is as regards the last (1,5.47) which is in prose ( while Višvarūpa quotes a verse ). It is remar kable that Visvarūpa quotes several verses from the fourth praśruri, which shows that even if the fourth praźna be an interpolation, it is comparatively an ancient one. The Mit. also (on Yāj. III. 306 ) quotes a long passage from the fourth prašna (IV.1.5-11 ). The words of the Sākuntala76 that the first precept is that a girl is to be given away to a meritorious person are probably a reminiscence of Baud. IV. 1. 12. Medhātithi on Manu. V. 117 quotes Baudhāyana I. 5. 47 and on IV. 36 quotes Baud. I. 4. 2 (which is mutilated as printed). On Manu. V, 114 he says that all the rules about purification of substances are contained in Baudhāyana-smrti. On Manu. V. 118, he quotes Baud. I. 5. 50.</p>
<p>About the home of Baudhāyana it is difficult to advance any positive conclusion. In modern times Baudhāyaniyas are mostly confined to the south. We know that Sāyana, the great commentator of the Vedas, was a Baudhāyaniya. A grant of Nandivarma, a Pallava, of the 9th century mentions Brāhmaṇas of the pravacina-sūtra as recipients.77 As Baudhāyana is called pravacanakāra in the Gịhyasūtra Bühler thinks (8. B. E. vol. 14 p. XLII) that the Brāhmanas belonged to the Baudhāyanacarana. Bühler is probably right. In the grant most of the donees are students of the Āpastamba Sūtra. First the Gotra, then the Sūtra and then the name of the donee are introduced in the grant. Therefore as some of the donees are said to be students of &ldquo;pravacanasūtra,&rdquo; it follows that &ldquo;pravacana&rdquo; stands for some sūtra school. It appears that sūtra and pravucunui are two different</p>

<p>things, whatever the latter term may mean. Baudhāyana is called pravacanakāra and Apastamba is styled sūtrakāra. We are toid by the Baudhāyana-gphysūtra78 that a Brāhmaṇa who studied sūtra and pravacana was styled “bhrūna.&rdquo; Bühler was inclined to hold that Baudhāyana was a southern teacher for several reasons. Baudhāyana mentions customs of the south and includes see-faring as a custom peculiar to the north (I. 1. 20 ), while in another place he places sea-faring at the head of sins (patanīyas ) lesser than the mortal ones (II. 1. 41 ). Therefore it is said that he was not a northern teacher. But as against this we have to remember that Baudhāyana (I. 1.29) quotes with approval a verse in which the countries of Avanti (Ujjain), Anga, Magadha, Surāstra ( Kathiawar) and Dakşiņāpatha are declared to be the home of mixed castes. Dakşiņāpatha was generally supposed to be the whole peninsula south of the Narmadā. Baudhāyana, if he was a native of the south, would not have spoken of his country as the home of mixed castes only, unless he put a restricted meaning on the word Daksiņāpatha ( which sometimes meant in later days Mahārāstra). Vide J. B. B. R. A. S. for 1917 p. 620. Though as stated above, the question of the home of Baudhāyana is a difficult one, yet if a definite inclination has to be shown, then I am disposed to agree with Bühler that the author of Baud. Dh. 8. was a southerner. It is important to note that Baud. wants to expound the dharmas declared in the Veda, in the Smrtis and those practised by ģistas (I. 1.1-4) and defines sistas (1. 1.5-6) as those who possess certain moral qualities and who understand the Veda together with other supporting sastras. He sets out first the five peculiar usages of the southern part, two of which are the usages of marrying one&rsquo;s maternal uncle&rsquo;s or paternal aunt&rsquo;s daughter, These two are even now in vogue in some parts of Mahārāstra and the South among certain sub-divisions of brāhmaṇas and were not prevalent in the north. Baudhāyana impartially sets forth five practices of the south and five of the north that were opposed to ancient śāstras and his own view appears to have been that in the case of all persons belonging to Aryāvarta ( whether they be in the northern or southern parts) both sets of five practices in sūtras ( 19 and 20 ) were not to be followed. In that connection he quotes several (three) views about Aryāvarta and two verses more, one of which</p>

<p>names the countries in which there is mixture of castes and the 2nd mentions some countries like Āratta (Panjab), Sauvīra, Puņdra, Vanga, Kalinga, sojourn in which made a person liable to undergo an expiation. The countries mentioned in the first verse are all (except Dakşiņāpatha ) to the north of the Narmadā. It is quite probable that he did not like the usage of marrying one&rsquo;s maternaljunole&rsquo;s or paternal aunt&rsquo;s daughter even for southern people. It should be noted that almost all the countries in the 2nd verse are north of the Narmadā. Further, Daksināpatha appears to have meant a country roughly liko modern Mahārāstra long before the Christian era; vide ASWI. Vol. V. p. 60 which shows that in an inscription (No. 1) of Nanaghat (Poona District ) Vedisiri is mentioned as king of Daksināpatha. Vide ASWI Vol. IV. p. 110 and Rudradāman&rsquo;s inscription (E. I. Vol. VIII at p. 44, where Satakarni is said to have been lord of Dakşiņāpatha). The fact that Āpastamblyas, Hiraṇyakeśins and Baudhāyaniyas have congregated much more in the suuth than in the north for centuries supports the above statement. The words Uttarā patha and Daksimāpatha were never strictly defined. For example, in the Sanjan plates ( supposed to be spurious ) of Buddhavarasa (E. I. Vol. 14 p. 144 at p. 149 about 700 A. D.) we meet with the words &lsquo;Uttarāpa thādhipati-Sri-Harşadevaparājayopalabdhogra-pratāpah&rsquo; i. e. king Harsa is said to have been lord of Uttarapatha. If we turn to the Harsacarita of Bāņa (first paragraph after two initial verses of the 5th Ucchyāsa ) we read &lsquo;Atha kadācid-rajā Rajyavardhanam-ābūya Hüņān hantum&hellip;cirantanairamātyaih&hellip; křtvā sābhisāram-uttarūpatham prāhiņot&rsquo;. This shows that Sthânvisvara (modern Thanesar) was not included in Uttarāpatha in Bāna&rsquo;s days. Uttarāpatha occurs in the Hathigumpha Inscription of Khāravela ( E.I. Vol. XX. p.71 at p. 79 and p. 88 ). Pānini knows the word as in V. 1.77 &lsquo;Uttarāpathenährtam ca&rsquo; ( Uttarāpathenährtam auttarāpathikam, Uttarāpathena gaochati auttarapathikah). About Dakşiņāpatha the Mahābhāsya says that large lakes are called &lsquo;Sarasi&rsquo; in Dakṣiṇāpatha (Kielhorn&rsquo;s ed. Vol. I. p. 73). The word &lsquo;Dakşiņāpatha oocurs in the gana</p>

It is uncertain whether the Häritadharmasūtra, a manuscript of which was discovered by the late Vaman Sastri Islāmpurkar at Nasik, is the one intended. Bühler thought that the work of Baudhāyana was earlier than that of Āpastamba by a century or two. His first reason was that Kāņva Baudhāyana receives homage in the tarpaņa before Āpastamba and Hiranyakesin and that the same order is observed in the Baudhayana-grhyasūtra. But this reason is far from convincing. It may be conceded that Baudhāyana was regarded as the oldest (or the most authoritative or respectable ) of the three schools of the Black Yajurveda. But from this it does not at all follow that the extant dharina-sūtra of the Baudhāyaniyas is earlier than that of the Āpastambiyas. For aught we know the sūtra compiled for the school of Baudhāyana may be later than the sūtra manual of the Āpastambiyas. We saw above that orthodox opinion, represented by Kumārila, regards Baudhāyana&rsquo;s work as later than Āpastamba&rsquo;s. All the three founders of the three schools are mentioned in the Baudhāyanagļhya and dharmasūtra. One may equally argue with good reason that both these works knew a sūtra work of Apastamba and that the extant dharmasūtra of Āpastamba is that work. Another reason assigned for the priority of Baudhāyana&rsquo;s work over Apastamba&rsquo;s is that, though both have numerous sūtras that agree almost word for word. a comparison of the views of the two writers shows that Apastamba lays down stricter and more puritanic (and therefore later) views on certain points than Baudhāyana. Gautama, Baudhāyana and Vasistha mention several secondary sons, while Apastamba is silent about them, Gautama, Baudhāyana (II. 2. 17, 62 ), Vasistha and even Visnu approve of the practice of niyoga, while Āpastamba condemns it (II. 6, 13.1-9). Gautama and Baudhāyana (1. 11. 1) speak of eight forms of marriage, while Āpastamba speaks of only six and omits Prājāpatya and Paišāca (II. 5. 11. 17-20 and II. 5. 12. 1-2). Baudhāyana (II.2.4-6) allowed a larger share to the eldest son on a partition, while Āpastamba condemns such a procedure (II. 6. 14. 10-14). The Baudhāyana-gļhyasūtra (II. 4, 6) allows upanayana to rathakūra, while Āpastamba (gshya 4. 10. 1-4) does not do so (dharmasūtra I. 1. 1. 19). These points are hardly conclusive on the question of date. From</p>

</ol>
<p>very ancient times there was great divergence of opinion among the doctors of the law on most, if not on all, of these points. There is no hard and fast rule that these doctrines were upheld by early writers and condeinned by later ones. Baudhāyana himself quotes the views of an ancient writer, Aupajanghani, who condemned all secondary sons. The verses that Baudhāyana quotes on this point (II. 2. 34-36 ) are quoted by Āpastamba also but without the author&rsquo;s name (Ap. II. 6. 13.6), there being variants only in the first verse. Niyoga was allowed by Manu (9. 56-63 ) and then condemned (9. 64-68) and Bșhaspati refers to this attitude of Manu (vide Kullūka on Manu 9. 68). Even 40 late a writer as Yājñavalkya (II. 131 ) approves of niyoga. About the rathakūra being allowed to consecrate the sacred firos there is a discussion in the sūtras of Jaimini (VI. 1. 44 ff). Vedic passages supported both methods viz. equal division among sons and the bestowal of a larger share on the eldest. Even Yājña valkya (II. 118) allows a larger share to the eldest son. Therefore, hardly anyone of the circumstances relied upon by Bühler as indicating a later age for Āpastamba is conclusive or convincing. The third ground for placing Baudhāyana before Apastamba is that the style of the former is simpler and older as compared with the latter&rsquo;s. That Baudhāyana is simpler than Āpastamba may be admitted. But this may be due to the fact that Baudhāyana has been tampered with more than Äpastamba. On the other hand Āpastamba contains more un-Pāṇinean forms, more uncouth constructions, more words in an archaic sense than is the case with Bandhāyana. All that is almost certain about the age of the Baudhāyana-dharmasūtra is that it is later than the work of Gautama, that its style, its doctrines and its general out-look on different subjeots do not compel us to assign it a later date than that of the other dharmasūtras. We have adduced evidence to show that long before the days of Sabara ( whose latest date cannot be later than 500 A. D.) the Baudhāyana-dharmasútra was an authoritative smộti; it follows that the dlarınasūtra must be placed somewhere between 500-200 B. C. Numerous sūtras are identical in Baudhāyana and Āpastamba e. g. Ap. I. 1. 2. 30 = Baud. I. 2. 40-41, Āp. I. 2. 6. 8-9 = Baud. I. 2. 39, Ap. I. 5. 15.8 = Baud. I. 2. 31, Ap. I. 11. 31. 11 and 16 = Baud. II. 3. 39 and 32. There are several verses that occur in both e. (). Baud. II. 1. 4% = Āp. I. 9. 27. 11, Baud. II. 2. 34-36 = Āp. II. 6. 13. 6 (thtag verses condemning secondary sors), Baud. II. 10. 63 Ap 11. 9. 21. 10, Baud. II. 7. 22-23 = Ap. II. 4. 9. 13. (two verdes1</p>
<p>History of Dhurmuśustra</p>
<p>Baud. II. 6. 36 = Āp. II. 9. 24. 8. Besides these there are numerous Vedic quotations that are common to both. All this, however, does not establish anything about their relative position. The Vasistha-dharmasūtra also has numerous quotations in common with Baud. Vide Vas. I. 15. = Baud. I. 1. 28, Vas. III. 5, 6, 11, 20, 56 = Baud. I. 1, 10, 12, 11, 8 and I. 5. 58. (respectively ); Vas. 6. 20-21 = Baud. II. 7. 22-23; Vas. VIII. 17 = Baud. II, 2, 1 ; Vas. XI. 27-28 = Baud. II. 8. 21-22; Vas. XVI. 34 = Baud. I. 10. 35, Vas. XVII. 73 = Baud. IV, 1. 17, Vas. XVII. 86 = Baud. I. 5. 102; Vas. XXII. 10 = Baud. I. 1. 33. It is to be noted that some of these quotations (Baud, II. 8. 21-22, I. 10. 35) occur in the extant Manusmrti (III. 125-126 and VIII, 98). There are a few prose sūtras in Vas that are transformed into verse in Baud. and vice versa e. g. Vas. III. 41 (prose) = Baud. 1. 5. 20 (quoted as a verse ), Vas. III. 57 ( quoted as a verse ) = Baud. I. 6. 19-20. It is not likely that one borrows from the other. There are two other possible explanations, viz. that both Baud. and Vas. (and Manu also) quote froin or adapt a common source or that the three works have been tampered with and interpolations introduced at every step. The latter alternative is too sweeping as the number of verses is very large and makes all the old sūtras except that of Gautama valueless for all chronological purposes. One cannot subscribe to the view that such extensive interpolations took place as the latter theory demands. The first alternative appears more reasonable. What that common source was, whether it was a regular work in verse or whether there was a floating mass of such popular verses as Bühler holds, are questions that present Very great difficulties. It is not easy to believe that there hundreds of floating verses on dharmu no body knew by whom composed, on which writers of the centuries preceding the Christian era drew for supporting their opinions. That does not sound as a very likely procedure. It is more probable that such verses were contained in a work or works now lost.</p>
<p>I tried on pp. 29-31 of the first edition to bring forward arguments on both sides of the question whether Baudhāyana Dh. S. is earlier or later than Apastamba and on p. 30 stated that the Baud. Dh. 8. may be placed between 500 B. C. and 200 B. C. Dr. Ram Gopal (p. 76 of his work) trots out the plea that I am inconsistent. I have given above an answer to this charge in the case of my remarks about Gautama. So I do not want to rebut here the charge of inconsistency. I am prepared to place Baudhāyana Dh. S. between 600 B. O, to 300 B. All these</p>

<p>In the tarpana, Baud. (II. 5. 21 ) mentions several appellations of Ganesa, viz. Vighna, Virāyaka, Sthüla, Varada, Hastimukha, Vakratunda, Ekadanta, Lambodara. But this affords no certain clue as to date. The worship of Vināyaka is found in tho Mänavagļhya also. In the tarpeixe (II. 5. 23 ) we have the seven planets montioned in the order of the days of the week and also Rāhu and Ketu ; besidos the twelve names of Visnu occur in II. 5. 24. In II. 1. 44 Baud. speaks of tho profession of an actor or of a teacher of dramaturgy (Natyācārya) as an upapătaka. Soveral sūtras attributed to Baudhāyana on the subject of adoption in the Dattakamimāmsā and other later works are taken from the Baudhāyanagrlyasoșasūtra (11. 6), the gūtras agreeing very closely with Vasistha ( 15.1-9).</p>
<p>According to Burnell the oldest commentator on the Baudhāyanaśrauta-sūtra was Bhavasvāmin, whom he placed in the 8th century. The commentary of Govindasvamin on the Dharmasūtra is a learned one and is generally to the point. He appears to be a very late writer.</p>

<li>Dharmasutra of Āpastamba. This has been edited several times (viz. by Bühler in the Boinbay Sanskrit Series with large extracts from Haradatta&rsquo;s commentary called Ujjvalā and also at Kumbhakonam with the complete commentary of Haradatta and translated by Bühler with an introduction in S. B. E. vol. II). The Apastan bakalpasūtra of the Taittiriya Sākhā of the black Yajurveda is divided into 30 pruśnas. According to Bühler, the first 24 praśnas contain the treatment of Srauta sacrifices; the 25th contains paribhūṣās, pravarakhanda, and Hautraka prayers to be recited by Hotr priests ; 26th and 27th praśnas constitute the Gșhyasūtra, the 28th and 29th Dharmasūtra and the 30th praśna is Sulvasútra. Bühler seems to be slightly inaccurate here. According to Caundappa, who commented on the Āpastambiya sūtras in the 14th century, the Āpastambiyaman trapātha forms the 25th and 26th praśnas of the Kalpasūtra and the Gșhyasūtra forms 27th prasna.80 The Srauta-sūtra of 80 पंचविशेष षइविंशे गृहमन्त्राः प्रपञ्चिताः । प्रश्नेथ सप्तर्विशे स्याब्रह्मतन्त्रविधिक्रमाती</li>

<p>Apastamba was edited by Dr. Garbe in the B. I. series ; the Gșhya and Mantrapātha were edited by Dr. Winternitz. The Gșhya with the commentary of Sudarsanārya has been edited in the Mysore Govt. Oriental series by Pandit Mahadeva Sastri ( in 1893). It is divided into eight patalas and 23 khandas. According to the Caranavyūha, Āpastamba (or &ldquo;bha&rdquo; as written in many southern mss.) is one of the five sub-divisions of the Khāndikiya school of the Taittiriyaśākha of the Black Yajurveda. Whether the author of the Āpastambiya Srauta, Gșhya and Dharma sütras is the same is difficult to detormine. One sūtra in the Āpastambadharma (II. 2. 5. 17 ) is the same as Ap. Srauta (III. 17. 8 and VIII. 4. 6). Oldenberg (S. B. E. vol. 30, p. XXXII) does not subscribe to Bühler&rsquo;s view (S. B. E. Vol. II, pp. XIII-XIV ) that the authors of the Ap. Srauta and Duerme were identical and gives it as his own view that another person of the same school might have imitated the style of the author of the Srauta. Whatever may be said of the identity of the authorship of the Srauta and Dharma sūtras, the Gșhya and Dharma seem to be very closely related and both seem to be the compositions of the same author. The Ap. Gșhya-sūtra, as compared with the Āśvalāyana-gphya or Gobhilagphya, is extremely brief and leaves out many rules that are given in other Grhya works. For example, about the choice of a girl, the Ap. Gr. gives only one worthwhile rule (I. 3. 18 )81, the other rules (1. 3. 10-17 ) are of a trivial character such as that the girl that is sleepy or weeping or leaves the house when the bridegroom&rsquo;s party comes to choose her or when the girl&rsquo;s name is that of a river, naksatra or tree or she has a name in which the penultimate letter is r or 1 &amp;c. but all those rules in the grhyasūtra (including the one in sūtra 18 ) are recommendatory and a marriage entered into against these rules would have been valid even in old times. The most important rule, breach of which would have made tho marriage void, is stated in Ār. Dh. S. II. 5. 11. 15-16 ) viz. that the gotra of the bride&rsquo;s father and of the bridegroom must not be the same and there must be no sapiņda relationship between the two on the mother&rsquo;s and father&rsquo;s side.</p>
<p>Dr. Ram Gopal says on p. 57 (of his work ) that I am not accurate when I state about the choice of a girl that Āp. Gr. S. gives only a single rule (I quoted that rule ). I added that it was the Ap. Dh. S. (II. 5. 11. 15-16 ) that provides that the girl must not be a sagotra or sapinda. Dr. Ram Gopalk awayed by</p>

<p>mere numbers. He points out that there are ten sūtras in Ap. Gț, about the choice of a marriageable girl. What I wanted to emphasise was that only one rule of Āp. Gr. was worth something and I quoted that rule. A marriage entered in defiance of all the ten rules in Āp. Gľ, would have been quite valid even in those days. I wanted to illustrate how Āp. Gr. S. was scrappy and omitted even vital matters. The rules (only two) forbidding a sagotra or sapinda girl for marriage were vital and breach of them would have made the marriage void. Ap. Gr. S. I. 3. 21 is not Āpastamba&rsquo;s opinion; it is the view of others (Yasyām manascakşuşor-nibandhas-tāsyām-rddhir-netaradādriyetetyeke ). Even this rule is recommendatory and not obligatory and a marriage in defiance of it would have been quite valid in those days and would be valid also in these days. That view occurs also in the Kāmasūtra III. 1, 14. Vide H. of Dh. vol. II, p. 432 note 1025 for further information. In the 2nd volume of H. of Dh, on pp. 437-38, I mentioned this prohibition of sagotra and sapravara marriages and recommended on pp. 498-99 that the legislature should intervene and loosen the absolute bar against sagotra and sapravara marriages. The Indian Parliament (by Act 25 of 1955, called the Hindu Marriage Act) has removed the bar against Sagotra and Sapiņda marriages to a great extent. Vide sections 3 (f and g) and 5 of that Act. The Āp. Grhya is silent about the forms of marriage, about holidays, about the duties of brahmacūrins and such other subjects which are generally treated of in other Grhyasūtras. These subjects are dealt with in the Āp. Dh. S, and there are several places where the Dharma sutra presupposes the existence of the Grhya and refers to it, Compare Āp. Dh. S. II. 1, 2. 10-1182 with Ap. Gr. S. III. 7 (particularly sūtras 1, 17, 23 ). Vide note 54 above. Some sūtras are identical in the Grhya and Dharma, e. g. Āp. Dh. S. I. 1.2. 38 and Gșhya IV. 11. 15-16 ( about the staff of Brahmacārin); Āp. Dh. 8. II. 4. 8.7 and Grhya V. 13, 19. In some cases the Grhya sūtra itself seems to refer to the teachings of the Dharmasūtra,</p>

<p>Each of the two praśnus of the Äpastamba-dharma-sútra is divided into eleven patalas, there being 32 and 29 khandikūs in the two patalas respectively. The Dharmasūtra is written in a more concise and compact style than that of Baudhāyana and has more archaio and un-Pāṇinean forms than any other extant Dharmasūtra. For example, the following are against the rules of Pānini; Adhāsana ( for adha āsana ) in I. 1. 2. 21, aglamsnu (1. 2. 3. 22 ), muhūnsca (I. 2. 8.22 ), agļhyamāna (I. 4., 12. 8), sarvatopeta (for &lsquo;sarvata upeta&rsquo;) in 1.6.19.9, sakhim (for sakhim) in I. 7. 21. 9. Haradatta points out in many places that the current reading was un-Pāṇinean and therefore he read differently (0.g. in II. %. 5. 2 he reads • aviprakramana&rsquo;, while the current reading was &lsquo;aviprakramina !:)83. This makes it probable that in the original text there must have been many more un-Pāninean forms than in the one preserved by Haradatta. There are many unfamiliar or rare words used by Apastamba, i. e. ananiyoga (1. 6. 19. 12), anaiscārika (I. 8. 22. 1), kartapatya (I. 2.5.3), vyupatoda and vyupajāva (-&lsquo;pa&rsquo;) in I. 2. 8. 15, brahmaha sainstuta (I. 1. 1. 32). We meet with strange forms of certain words, such as paryānta (1. 3. 9. 21 ), praśāsta (II. 8. 19. 3), anatyaya (I. 1. 1. 21, for anatyaya ), brahmojjham (for-ojjliah ) in I. 7. 21. 8, śvāvit (1. 5. 17. 37), şthevana (I. 11. 30. 19 for sthivana ), ācāryadāre (for-dāreșu) in I. 2. 7. 27. Though the Ap. Dluarnasūtra is mainly in prose, there are versos here and there.Somo of the verses are expressly stated to be taken from other sources by being introduced with the word &ldquo;udaharanti&rdquo; or with “athāpyudābaranti&rdquo; e. g. I. 6. 19.13 (two ślokas from a Purana), 1. 6. 19. 15 (compare Manu 8. 317 and Vas. 19. 44 ), I. 11. 31. 1, I. 11. 32. 24, II. 4. 9.13 (two verses, same as Baud. II. 7. 22-23), II. 7. 17.8, II. 6. 13.6 (three verses almost the same as in Baud. II. 2. 34-36 ), II. 9. 23. 4-5 (two ślokas from a Purāna ). Besides these, there are several isolated verses, most of which seem to be quotations, though not introduced with words liko &ldquo;udāharanti</p>

<p>They aro I. 4. 14. 25, 1. 6. 19.14 (the first pāda of which is Manu 4.212 ), I. 9. 27. 10, I. 9. 27. 11 (same as Baud. II. 1. 42 ), II. %. 4. 14 (compare Manu III. 101 ). Some of these verses are defective in metre, there being nine syllables in one anustubh pāda as in 1. 9. 27. 10, II. 9. 23. 4-5, II. 2. 4. 14. One of the verses is in tho classical Upajāti metre (II. 7. 17. 18), while another closely approaches that metre (I. 9. 27. 11). Besides these, there are a few half-verses, II. 5. 11. 5-6 ( same as latter half of Vanaparva 133. 1), II. 9. 21 10 ( Manu 6. 43 has the first pāda ). Thus in all there are about twenty verses, of which at least six occur in</p>
<p>Baudhāyana. Some sūtras that are printed as prose are parts of vorses, e. g. I. 2. 5. 11. Besidese these, there are several verses in the patalas dealing with metaphysics (1.8. 22. 4-8 and I. 9.23. 1-3 ) that are pieced together largely from Upanisad passages. Āpastamba in several places employs the first person plural about himself, e. g. I. 1. 1.27, I. 8. 23. 4. Haradatta points out that in his day there was difference in the text as handed down in Northern and in Southern India.85</p>
<p>Āpastamba quotes, besides the Saihitūs, the Brālmanas very frequently (e. g., I. 1.1, 10-11, 1.1.3.9, I. 1. 3. 26, I. 2.7.7, 1. 2. 7. 11, I. 3. 10,8), He quotes the Vājasaneyaka (1. 5. 17. 31 ) and the Vājasaneyi-brāhmana (I. 4. 12. 3 on svädhyāya), he speaks of the Upanişads (II. 2. 5. 1), his quotations (II. 2. 3. 16-11. 2. 4.1-9) from the Tai. Aranyaka agree, according to Bühler, with the text current in the Andhra country. He speakg8Sa of the six angas of the Veda (in II. 4. 8. 10), and I added from the Kumbhakonam edition (which I was then using ) and the next sūtra enumerates chandas, kalpu, grammar, jyotisa, Nirukta, Śikṣā (phonetics ) and Chandoviciti (metrics ) which are seven etc.&rsquo; I find that Haradatta reads Chandaḥkalpa as one word and explains Chando Vedas-tatkalpayati &hellip; iti Chandahkalpaḥ Kalpasūtrāņi&rsquo;. This is an extremely far-fetched explanation. Everywhere the Vedāngas are six. No other writer mentions so far as I know Chandah-kalpa as an anga</p>

<p>I pointed out the discrepancy relying on the two sutras is printed. I thought that the word Chandas was printed inadvor tontly (before ‘Kalpa&rsquo;). There is a further inelegance. If the reading Chandah-kalpa be accepted, then the word Chandas is used in the same sentence in two senses viz. Veda and metro, Besides, Vedāngas are all related to the Vedas and Kalpa in the context of the enumeration of Vedāngas would only mean ritual of Vedic sacrifices&rsquo; and in Chandah-kalpa the word Chandas&rsquo; then would be redundant. He speaks of the six reigns of the Veda ( II. 4. 8. 10 ) and in the next sūtra enumerates Chandas, Kalpa, grammar, Jyotişa, Nirukta, Siksa, (phonetics ) und Chandoviciti (metrics ), which are soven (Siksā boing probably intended to boincluded in grammar). There are passages in Apastamba which agree with the Nirukta, e. g. the definition of ācārya 16. He quotes the views of ten writers on dhurmu by name, viz. Eka (I. 6. 19.7), Kanva (1.6.19.3 and I. 10. 28. 1), Kāpva (I. 6. 19.7 ), Kuņika (1. 6. 19.7), Kutsa (I. 6. 19.7), Kautsa (I. 6. 9.4 and 7, 1. 10. 28. 1), Puskarasādi (I. 6. 19.7, 1. 10. 28. 1), Vārsyāyani (I. 6. 19, 5 and 8, 1. 10. 28.2), Svetaketu (I. 4. 13. 19 and 1.7, 5. 6), Harita (1. 4, 13, 11, 1, 6. 18. 2, 1. 6. 19. 12, 1. 10. 28,1, 5 and 16, 1. 10.29. 12 and 16). Some of the names (viz. Kautsa, Värsyāyani, and Puskarasādi ) occur in the Nirukta. He quotes the view of Svetaketu in śvetaketu&rsquo;s own words ( in I. 4. 13. 20 ) that even a married man should every year stay with his teacher for two months to refresh his studies and gives it as his own opinion that Svetaketu&rsquo;s view is opposed to the Šāstras (the Vedas). In another place (I. 1. 4. 5-6 ) le speaks of Svetaketu as an avara (a person belonging to later ages ) and as one who on account of the remnant of his merito rious actions done in it foriner life or lives was able to grasp the four Vedas in a short time. It is usual to see in this a reference to Svetaketu in the Chāndogya Upanişad ( VI. 1. 1-2), where it is stated that Svetaketu mastered all the Vedas in twelve years. But this identification is somewhat of doubtful value. Apastamba: quotes Svetaketu as a teacher of dharma. The quotation from Svetaketu given by Āpastamba has nothing corresponding to it in the Upanişad. Besides, the Chāndogya Upanisad appears to Diake a distinction between two Svetaketus ( in VI. I and VI. 8). one being called Āruņeya and the other Ārupi ( son of Arunak 3o Araiagaita 31714: ' 3719. 9. I. 1.1, 14 ; &lsquo;31191g: AH</p>

<p>Härsta, whose views are cited:so frequently, is quoted by Baudhā yana (II. 1. 50 ) and also by Vasistha (II. 6.). From the two sūtras (1.6.19.3 and 7 ) it follows that Kanya and Kanva are two distinct writers. The Kumbhakonam edition reads Kāņva in I. 10. 28. 1, while Bühler reads Kanva there. Kāņva Bodhāyana is a teacher, whose name occurs in the rşitar pana in many works. The view ascribed to Kānva by Apastamba in I.6.19.7 seems to bo the same as that of the Baudhāyana-dharmasūtra (I. 2. 1987). It has been shown above that there are close parallels in thought and oxpression between Baudhāyana and Apastamba. In several places Apastamba seems to be controverting the views of Baudhāyana or similar views held by others. Āpastamba condemns the view of giving the paternal wealth to the eldest son as opposed to the Vedas and explains the Vedic text (Tai. S. II. 5.2.7, quoted above ) about the eldest son being endowed with all wealth as a</p>
<p>nere anuvāda and not a vidhi (vide Ap. Dh. S. II. 6. 14. 6-13). Baudhayana cites both the texts of the Tai. S. about equal division among sons and about the oldest son&rsquo;s larger share and seems to favour the latter view by putting it last (11. 2. 2-7). Similarly, the discussion in Apastamba (I. 1. 4. 5-12 ) about it brahmacūrin eating the leavings (ucchişta ) of his guru, provided the things are not directly forbidden by Sruti, soons to be directed against Baudhāyana (II. 1. 25-26). Although Ā.pastamba does not expressly quote Gautama, he appears to have had before him the Gautama-dharma-sütra. He speaks of it smrti (II. 6. 15. 25) that lays down that upunayana confers rulhilcāra on a man for sastric actions and that before upanayan ono is free to do any thing and to eat anything, This, as inter preted by Haradatta, refers to Gautama (II. 1). There are striking coincidences between Gautama and Äpastamba, 0, $. Gaut. I. 19. = Ap. I. 1. 1. 41 (about some teachers prescribing the yellow robe to a brahmacārin), Gaut. I. 3 = Ap. 11. 6. 13.7 ( about the violation of dharma by the great in fornier ages ), (Gaut. 9. 52 = Ap. I. 11. 31. 13, Gaut. 23. 9. = Ap. 1. 9. 25. 2; Gaut, 16. 19 = Ap. I. 3.9. 14-15 ). Apastamba frequently refers to the views of his predecessors in the words &lsquo;eke&rsquo; (I. 1.2.</p>

It is somewhat remarkable that in many of these cases (where &lsquo;eke&rsquo; occurs ), the views are those either held by Gautama or ascribed by him also to others, e. g. Āp. I. 1. 2. 38 about the staff of a brahmacūrin refers to Gaut. I. 23; Āp. I. 1. 2. 41 is almost same as Gant. I. 19, Ap. I. 2. 5. 20 seems to refer to Gaut. 1, 54-59, Ap. 1.3. 9. 3 (the view of some that Vedic study lasts for four months and a half) seems to refer to Gaut. 16. 2, and Ap. 1.3.11. 3 (about not studying after dining at a sacrifice for deities that are manusya-prakrti) pointedly refers to Gaut. 16. 34 which contains the word &lsquo;manusyayajñabhojana&rsquo;. Apastamba twice quotes verses from a Purāņa (I. 6. 9. 13, II. 9. 23. 3) and in one place gives in prose the view of a Purana (1. 10. 29.7.)89. Āpastamba (II. 9. 24. 6) speaks of the view of a Bhavisyat purāna ( about creation of the world after a periodic dissolution). In one place Apastamba (II. 11. 29. 11-12 ) says that the knowledge that exists (traditionally ) among women and sūdras is the furthest limit of vidyū and it is said to be a supplement of the Atharvaveda.' Here he probably refers to Arthaśāstra, which according to the caranavyuha, is the Upaveda of the Atharva veda. Āpastamba refers (II. 7. 16. 1) to Manu as founder of the institution of śrāddha. But this appears to be a reference to Manu, the mythical progenitor of mankind, and not to the Manusmrti. It is noteworthy that Āpastamba (II. 7. 17. 8) quotes a verse, which is the same as Anušāsanaparva 90. 46 ( sambhojani näma &amp;c.).</p>
<p>The Apastambadharmasūtra stands in a peculiar relation to the Pūrvamimāṁsā. It is the only extant Dharmasütra that contains many of the technical terms and doctrines of the Mimāṁsā. He says (I. 1. 4.8)' a positive Vedic text is more cogent than an usage which merely leads to an inforence (of its being based on a Vedic text now lost 90 ). This refers to Jaimini&rsquo;s rule (I. 3. 3)&rdquo; if there is a conflict between an express Vedic</p>

<p>text and Smrti, the latter is to be disregarded : but if there be no confliot an inference (may be made that the Smrti is based upon some Sruti)&rdquo;. In another place Āpastamba says (1. 4. 12. 11 ) &lsquo;where an action is done on account of finding pleasure therefrom (i. e. from a worldly motive ), there is no ( inference of its being based on ) Sastra&rsquo;. This is the same as Jaimini&rsquo;s teaching (IV. 1. 2 )&rsquo;. He speaks of the convention (samy) of those who know Nyāya (i. e. Mimāṁsā ) that angas ( such as the Kalpasūtras are ) cannot be designated the Vedas ( which are the principal), which is clearly a reference to Purvamimālisa (1. 3. 11-14)” and he says that those who know Nyāya lay down that a mere unurūda (affirming or reciting) of what is well known to all is not a positive rule ( a vidhi ), which is similar to Jaimini&rsquo;s rule93. The dictum of Āpastamba that the word &ldquo;sale&rdquo; (kraya ) applied to a bride in some Vedic texts is merely figura tive closely resembles Jaimini&rsquo;s94 remarks on the same point.</p>
<p>The remark of Āpastamba that the rules of anadhyāya only apply to Vedic study and not to the recital of mantras at sacri fices corresponds to a rule in Jaimini&rsquo;s almost in the same words. These examples show that in Āpastamba&rsquo;s day Mimā msā doctrines had been far advanced and that works existed that dealt with Mimāmsā topics (Nyāyas ). The correspondence in language with the Pürvamīmāmsāsūtra is so close that one is tempted to advance the view that Āpastamba knew the extant Mimāṁsā-sūtra or an earlier version of it that contained almost the same expressions. It cannot be said that all these passages are later interpolations. They have all been explained by Haradatta and one of the sütras referring to Mimāṁsā topics ocours in so early a work as the commentary of Visvarūpa (on Yāj. 1. 7) who quotes “ Brāhmanoktā vidhayaḥ&quot; &amp;c. ( Āp. I. 4. 12. 10). The last passage is quoted by Medhātithi also (on Manu II. 6).</p>

<li>Dharmasūtra of Apastamba</li>
</ol>
<p>65</p>
<p>The dharmasūtra of Āpastamba has been quoted from very ancient times as authoritativo. Sabara in his bhāsya on Jaimini VI. 8. 18 quotes one sūtra of Āpastamba and a paraphrase of another. 96. The Tantravārtika refers to the sūtras of Apa stamba about local and family usages, 97 about drinking wine and about the conflict between the views of Baudhāyana and Apastamba (vide above page 46 also ). Sankarācārya in his bhāsya on Brahmagūtra IV. 2. 14 quotes Āpastamba I. 7. 20. 3 (about the planting of trees for fruit as a meritorious act and the collateral benefits of shade and fragrance ). He also cites (on Brahmasūtra II. 1. 1. ) about the Supreme Soul a half verss from Apastamba (I. 8. 23. 2) 98. In his bhāsya on Brhad aranyaka, he cites Ap. Dh. S. I. 5. 15. 1 (upāsane gurunam &amp;c.). Ap. Dh. S.. (II. 9. 23. 3-5) quotes from a Purana two verses which are very similar to two verses quoted by Sankarācārya in his Bhasya on Chan. Up. V. 10. 1. Visvarupa on Yai. III. 252 refers to one verse and a half quoted by Apastamba (I.9.25. 11 Tri. ed.) and explains it. The two patalas of Apastamba (I.8. 22 and 23 ) dealing with adhyātma (philosophy ) were commented upon by Sankarācārya, who, from the general style and method of the commentary (vide Trivandrum edition of the adhyat mapatala) seems to be the same as the great ācārya. Sureśvara in his Vārtika (I. 1. 97) on Sankara&rsquo;s bhūsya on the Brha dāraṇyakopanişad quotes the sūtra about the planting of mango ( Āpastamba I. 7. 20. 399) troos. Viśvarūpa, who according to Madhava, was the the same as Suresvara,100 quotes (Trivandrum edition) in his commentary on Yājñavalkya (ācāra and vyavahāra only) Apastamba&rsquo;s sūtras about twenty times. The quotations show that the text of Apastamba was identical with the 96 &quot; यथैव स्मृतिः &lsquo;धर्मे च अर्थे च कामे च नातिचरितव्या&rsquo; इति, &lsquo;धर्मप्रजासंपने बारे</p>

<p>History of Dharmaśāstra</p>
<p>one printed, barring a few variations that are no more than mere slips on the part of the soribes of Mss. In his commentary on Yāj. III. 237 Visvarūpa quotes eighteen sūtras of Āpagtamba (I. 9.24. 6-23) consecutively which are the same as those in the printed text. Medhātithi quotes Āpastamba II. 5. 11. 2, II. 4. 7. 16, II. 8. 19, 20, 1. 4. 14. 30-31 on Manu II. 247, III. 102, III, 273 and VIII 357 respectively and appears to refer to Āpastamba I. 4. 13. 6 (about &ldquo;om&rdquo;) on Manu II. 83. The Mitākşarā has several quotations and Aparārka contains about two hundred sūtras of Āpastamba, though rather in a mutilated form. But it is not necessary to refer to these and other later works in detail, since Haradatta&rsquo;s commentary, as will be shown later on, was written about the time of Aparārka. Thus from the days of Sabara ( 400 A. D. at the latest) to 1100 A. D. we have a host of writers who youch for the authenticity of the extant text of Āpastamba.</p>
<p>About the home and personal history of Apastamba little is known. Apastamba is not an ancient name. It does not occur in the Vedic texts. It occurs in the gana “Bidādi&quot; in Pāṇini IV.1. 104. Dr. Ram Gopal (on p. 75 of his work ) thinks rather naively that the occurrence of @pastamba&rsquo;s name in the Bidādigana iends some support to the view that Āpastamba is earlier than Pāṇini. The Bidadi-gana has nothing to do with literary works, but is concerned only with the addition of a termination to the words in the gana in the sense of (gotrāpatya) * a descendant from grandson downwards but not a son&rsquo;. Bida&rsquo;s</p>
<p>son would be Baidi, but his grandson would be Baida. Besides, this gana contains about fifty words in the Ganapātha now available. Āpastamba is the 14th in the list. Moreover, the ganas are liable to be added to as illustrated by what is said above on Kambojādigana. Besides, the mere occurrence of the word Apastamba in the Bidādi-gana does not convey that the person mentioned is the author of the Gphya or Dharma-sūtra known now as Āpastamba&rsquo;s. All that can be held to follow from the Bidādi-gana is that a person named Apastamba and his descendants named after him were known at the time.

<p>the udicyas (II. 7. 17. 17 ).102 Apastamba must be supposed to have embodied in his work tha usages of his own country. If he specially mentions the usages of a particular locality, it would follow that he did not hail from that looality. But the exact meaning of &ldquo;Udicya&rdquo; is doubtful. Haradatta quotes a verse of the grammarians, according to which the Country north of the Saravati was called &ldquo;Udicya”. According to the Mahārņava quoted in the commentary on the Caranavyūhata the Apastambiyas were to be found to the south of the Narmada, in the south-east, that is, in Andhra and the territory about the mouth of the Godavari. Therefore it is natural to suppose that Āpastamba&rsquo;s school had its origin in the south and probably in</p>

<p>Now that rather puerile arguments have been advanced by Dr. Ram Gopal about the home of Āpastamba, Baudhāyana and Hiranyakəsin (on pp. 96-100), a more thorough reply is given here by reference to numerous grants and inscriptions,</p>
<p>Dr. Ram Gopal does not bother about inscriptions and copper plate grants. I had referred in the first edition (of 1930 ) to Pallava grants in general and mentioned a specific one in I. A. Vol. V, p. 155. In that grant five out of the eight donees</p>

Pāṇini in VI, 3, 120 explains the word Sarāvati as meaning abounding in reeds, which may be applicable to many rivers, Dr. Ram Gopal, after referring to the different Identifications, made by various scholars (pp. 95-96). finds that in the Rāmāyaṇa ( II. 68. 13-16) occurs a river called Saradandā and at once jumps to the conclusion that Saradanda&rsquo;conveys</p>

<p>All these are specially cited by me for Āpastambhiyas as donees, Now about Bodhāyana ( Baudhāyana). It has been seen above that Bodhāyana is called &lsquo;pravacanakāra&rsquo; in the passages on tarpana (vide note 68 a above) and hence in some early grants the donees are describod as students of Pravacana or Pravacana sutra or-carana or-Kalpa, though in the South Indian records from the 11th century A.

<p>The age of the Āpastamba-dharmasūtra can be settled within only approximate limits. It is probably later than the Gautaina Dharma-sutra and also the Baudhāyayana dharmasutra and before 400 A. D. it was an authoritative smrti work according to Sabara. Āpastamba is enumerated by Yājñavalkya as a writer on dharma (1. 5) and by Sankha-Likhita. Its grammar which often deviates from Panini leads one to infer that he flourished a little before or immediately after Pānini. As he quotes the views of ten writers on Dharma śāstra he cannot be placed amongst the early writers on Dharma. It is doubtful whether the provision that one should not take food from a Sargha can be taken to refer to Buddhist sangha. Pāṇini employs the word sangha in several sūtras (IV. 3. 127, V. I. 58, V. 2.52 ), but in all these there is no clear indication of the ideas attached to the Buddhist Sangha. Ap. Dh. S. I. 6. 18. 31 (avidhină ca pravrajitaḥ) provides that one should not take food from one who has become an ascetic without observing the rules about entering that order. This does not necessarily mean that he refers to Buddhist and Jain monks. As Sannyasa became popular many must have pretended to be sannyāsins without first observing the rules for entering that order. The Āp. Dh. 8. was probably composed at a time when the Mimāṁsā system had already been founded. Hence if a tolerably definite period is demanded, then the Āp. Dh, 8. should have to be assigned to the period of 450-350 B, C, and not 600-300 B.C. (as in the first edition).</p>
<p>On p. 84 of the first edition I tried to explain why we have a complete set of srauta, gļhya and dharma sūtras for Baudhi yana and others (all belonging to the Kșspa-yajurveda) and why an Aśvalāyana-dharmagūtra for Rgvedins and Gobhila dharmasūtra for sāmavedins or Pāraskara (or Kātiya ) Dharma. sūtra for Sukla Yajurveda had not coine down to us. Dr. Ram Gopal would not miss an opportunity to criticize the H. of Dh. as he does on pp. 51-52. I have had often to show in this edition the worth of his research.</p>
<p>But on the subject of Āpastamba&rsquo;s home which he holds to have been in North India his remarks display the tantastic nature of some of his researches. He relies on fom, pietas of internal evidence to corroborate his view that Apastakaba - home was in the North. First, he renarks ' a number of words which</p>

<p>aro of rare occurrence in Sanskrit and which are peculiar to the sūtras of Āpastamba are current even now in the language which is spoken in Kuru-Pañcāla and its neighbourhood.' He cites p. 96 only two words, viz. ghola (a horse ) and bhayedala (dangerous or furious ram), both from Ap. Srauta (XV. 3. 12 and XV. 19. 4 respectively) &lsquo;ājyasthālim rauhiņakapāle ca parimaņdale-ghota-prakāre&rsquo; Āp. Śr. XV. 3. 12 and &lsquo;atha yadi grdhraḥ salāvřki bhayedako dirgha-mukhyulūko&hellip;sakunir ( Ap. XV. 19. 4). He cites no similar words from either the Grhyasūtra or Dharmasūtra of Āp. He remarks ‘Āp. S.S. XV. 3. 12 employs the word Ghoța to denoto a horse, and the word Tist is used in Hindi in the same sense&rsquo;. His idea appears to be (though he does not make a very clear statement ) that as Hindi is now spoken in what was called Kuru-Pañcāla in ancient times and Hindi-speaking people use the word ghodā (for horse ) now, the ancient Ap. Ś. S. which employs the word ghoța in the same sense should be regarded as composed in north India. Research means careful endeavour and inquiries to discover facts by the scientific study of a subject. If Dr. Ram Gopal had inquired of non-Hindi people in Delhi such as Bengalis, Gujaratis and Mahārāstrians (of whom large numbers are now residents of Delhi) he would have found that all these groups of people employ the same word for a horse respectively in Bengali, Gujarati and Marathi. If he had referred to the Amarakośa 1026 he would have found that ghotaka is held by that comparatively early work as a synonym of aśva ( ghotake viti-turaga-turanga svaturangamāḥ). If he had carried his inquiries further he would have found that the Kamasutra 1026 of Vātsyāyana (in I. 1.4) mentions a predecessor named Ghoțakamukha, who wrote . work on Kanyāsamprayuktakādhikarana and who was so called probably because he had a long neck like that of a horse. In the Arthaśāstra of Kautilya the name &lsquo;Ghota-mukha&rsquo;is cited in V.5.11 as that of a minister. Ghotaka or ghota therefore looks anoient enough as a purely Sanskrit word.

<p>phist who knows all the south Indian languages informs me that the linguists regard the word as Dravidian and connect it with Telugu gurramu and Kannada Kudire or kudure. If the word ghota be Dravidian, Dr. Ram Gopal&rsquo;s argument would recoil on him like a boomerang. The same reasoning applies to the word &lsquo;bhayedaka&rsquo;( bhayahetubhūtah adakah, &amp; dangerous ram). That word is compounded of bhaya ( danger) and edaku (ram ). The word &lsquo;bhaya&rsquo; by itself occurs even in the Rgveda at least a dozen times and otaka means &lsquo;ram&rsquo; according to Amarakośa 102 , Meşa is a synonym of &lsquo;edaka&rsquo; and both these words occur in the present day Marathi. Edaka is one of the three unclean (amedhya ) animals acc. to Sat. Br. XII. 4. 1. 4. Edaka is the 2nd word in &lsquo;ajādi-gana&rsquo; (&lsquo;ajādyataştıp&rsquo; Pān. IV, 1.4). When Pāṇini mentions a gana with ādi it must be presumed that at least the first three of the words in the gana were known to him, though we know that in some ganas somo words were inserted later. Following the reasoning of Dr. Ram Gopal one may as well say that Āpastamba&rsquo;s home was in Mabarastra where both words (ghodā and edakā) are found in the people&rsquo;s speech and the latter word at least was known before Pāṇini. Both these words were regarded as Sanskrit in the centuries before and after the Christian era by lexicogra phers and odaka was known many centuries before Christ, when there was no Hindi language in existence at all. This argument of Dr. Ram Gopal, it would be seen, is ridiculous and worthless.</p>
<p>On p. 97 Dr. Ram Gopal relies, for propping his hypothesis that Apastamba came from the north on certain phonetic tendencies that characterize modern Hindi. He instances only one word viz. Sikşā (in Āp. Dh. S. II. 4. 8. 11) which is one of the six Vedāngas and compares it with Hindi &lsquo;sikha&rsquo;. This is on a par with his reliance on ghotaka and adaka referred to above. Sikha in Hindi means to learn or a pupil, while Śīksā or Śikṣā is a name for a Veđãnga and śikha in the sense to learn&rsquo; is derived from the root siksa (to learn, &lsquo;Siksate &lsquo;) and</p>
<p>sikba&rsquo; (pupil) is derived from &lsquo;sisya&rsquo;. I feel grave doubts whether Dr. Ram Gopal is aware of the real technical meaning of &lsquo;Siksā&rsquo; or Sikşā&rsquo; occurring in the Upanişads and other ancient works. Vide note 85 a above where the Tai. Up. employs the dirgha&rsquo;i in Sikşā and briefly enumerates the subjects of that vedānga and Āp. belonging to the Kršņa Yajured, uses the word as Śikṣā but Mupdaka employ, śikṣā.

<p>It was probably written at a time when Jaimini had founded his school. Hence we shall not be far wrong if we assign it to some period between 600-300 B. C. On several points his views are opposed to those of his predecessors, e.g. he rejects secondary sons, condemns niyoga, does not admit Paisāca and Prājāpatya as valid forms of marriage (vido above page 50). There aro other points also wherein Āpastamha differs from Gautama and the other sūtrakāras. Gautama (IV. 14-17) and Baudhāyana (I. 8. 7-12 ) give long lists of mixed castes and Gautama includes Yavana among them. Āpastamba is silent on this point. But this has hardly any bearing on chronology. Even the Vedic works mention the Nisada and the Pūrvainimāṁsāsūtra has a special adhikarana (VI. 1. 51 ) devoted to him; the Br. Upanişad Inentions (IV.3. 22 and 37 ) such castes as Cändāla, and the Gitā mentions the śvapāka. The Ap. Srauta speaks of the Nişūda (9, 14. 12-13). The Äp. Dh. S. (11. 1. %. 6) mentions Cândāla, Paulkasa and Vaiņa. Gautama (17. 30 ) forbids the eating of the flesh of cows and bulls, while Ap. (I. 5. 7. 30-31 ) seems to allow it and cites the Vājasaneyaka for support. In this connection it has to be noted that Vasistha also has a similar sūtra (14. 46). Āp. (I. 9. 27. 10) prescribes a penance for one who practises usury and lays down that one should not eat at the usurer&rsquo;s (I. 6. 18. 22 ), while Gautama appears to allow usury to a Brāhmana as a calling if done through an agent (X. 6). Baudhāyana, on the other hand, quotes verses that condemn usury in strong language as even worse than brahma hatyā, holds that a Brāhmaṇa who is a usurer should be treated as a südra and allows the first two castes to practise usury only towards atleists, šūdras and such like persons (I. 5. 79-81). So these differences of Ap. from others are hardly conclusive as to his chronological position.</p>
<p>Dr. Ram Gopal on p. 75 of his work refers to the fact that I place Āpastamba between 600 B. O. and 300 B. O. (on p. 45 of H. Dh. vol. I), and then remarks that'(he) adduces no cogont arguments in support of his view' and then patronizingly adds * It is not possible in the present state of researches into Vedic literaturo, to assign precise dates to individual sūtrakāras and we at the most determine approximately the lower and uppor limits of the sūtra period. We are, therefore, not going to discuss here the possibility of assigning dates to individual authors'. I am going to show that he himself adduces hus.se cogent arguments' for the dates he assigns.

<p>period between 600 B. O. to 300 B, C. (to whioh I assigned Apastamba ) is not, I hope it will be admitted by most people, a precise date at all and is far more unprecise than what Dr. Ram Gopal would assign to him (as I am going to point out below from his own work). On p. 89 of his work Dr. Rani Gopal remarks &lsquo;inost of the sūtras were composed betweon circa 800 B. C. and 500 B. C. From the general words employed by him on p. 90 it appears to be his view that not only the Srauta and Gșhya sūtras but other sūtras also and Dharmasūtras were composed between 800 B. O. to 500 B. C. On p. 84 of his work he mentions four groups of sūtras ( srauta, gphya and dharma). He himself says that all the sitras belonging to the 4th group seem to be later than the beginning of the Christian era&rsquo;. This group should be omitted from consi. deration. The first group contains 11 sūtra works (Srauta, Grhya and Dharma), the 2nd group contains 10 sūtra works (all except Ap. Dh. S. being either Srauta or Gphya). The third group contains eight works, all either Srauta or Grhya except Vasistha Dh. S., of which only the sūtra portion (and not verses) is included in this group. He regards all the sūtras in group one and most of those in group 2 as earlier than Pāṇini. The main prop of his dates for the three classes of sūtras is Papini&rsquo;s date. On p. 86 he states that divergent views have been expressed by eminent scholars about Pāṇini&rsquo;s date ranging from 7th century B. O. to 4th century B. C. In this welter of diffe ring views Dr. Ram Gopal fixes the dats of Pānini at about 600 B.C-550 B.O (p. 88). What is the strony evidence on which he relies for this date? It is only this that he holds Patañjall'. date to be 150 B. C. and affirms that there is a near unanimity among scholars about this date. Then he conjectures (pp. 87-88) that a period of at least two centuries intervened between Patañjali and Katyāyana (the author of the vārtikas on Pāṇini) and that another period of at least 200 years must be held to separate Kātyāyana and Pāṇini (pp. 87-88). My aim is only to show how large a part conjectures play in these dates of Katyāyana and Panini. Taking, however, for the moment these conjectures as good arguments, three groups of sūtra works ( 29 in all) set out by Dr. Ram Gopal have to be squeezed into a period of three hundred years, the third group being later than the second and the 2nd group later than first. For all the three groups the total period allotted is 300 years (807 B to 500 B. C.). The first group is the largest and it would to be unjust to say that the largest group (viz. the first ) should be</p>

<p>allotted 125 years (out of 300 ), that is, the first group flourished between 800 B. O. to 675 B. C. according to Dr. Ram Gopal, tbe 2nd group may be allotted 100 years (i. e. 675-575 B.C.) and the third group of only 8 works may be assigned 75 years i. e. from 575 B C to 500 B. O, The Srauta, Gphya and Dharma sütras of Apastamba are placed in the 2nd group by Dr. Ram Gopal i. A. Apastamba himself is placed between 675 B.C.-575 B.C. by him. It would be noticed that this dating of the learned Doctor for Apastamba is far more precise than my date for Äpastamba (on p. 45 of vol. I of H. Dh.) viz. 600 B. O, to 300 B, C. While saying that it is impossible to assign precise dates to individual sutrakāras and professing not to give precise dates to them, he puts the authors of ten sūtra works within the short span of about 100 years and assigns individual authors of the 2nd group of the Būtra works to the period from about 675 B. C. to 575 B.C. Scholars will note the great disparity that Dr. Ram Gopal exhibits between his precepts and his performance.</p>
<p>This is not the place to discuss at length the dates of Patanjali and Pāṇini. But a few words must be said on account of the importance attached to those dates by some scholars in settling the chronology of Dharmasūtra works. Dr. D. C. Siroar advances arguments for questioning the date 150 B: O. for Patanjali and himself holds that Patanjali flourished about 100 A. D. ( vide I. H. Q. Vol. 15 pp. 633-38). The date 150 B, C. for Patañjali is mainly based on Mahābhāsya reforences to Puşyamitra (Sunga ruler between about 187 B. O. to 151 B. C.). On Vārtika 7 to Pāņini I. 1.69 (svain rūpam etc.) the Mahābhäsya cites the instances of &lsquo;Pusgamitrasabha&rsquo; and &lsquo;Candraguptasabha;&rsquo; on Vārtikas 3 and 4 on Pāņ. III. 1. 26 it cites (Puşyamitro yajate yājakā pājayantiti tatra bhavitavyan Pusgamitro pājayate yājakā yajantiti&hellip;tam (tyāgam ) ca Pusyamitrah karoti yajakā prayojayante). Again, on Vārtika 1 on Dān. III.2. 123 (vartamáne lag) the Mahābbāşya says &lsquo;iha Puşyamitram yājayāmaḥ&rsquo;. There are several difficulties in the case of these passages. There are what are called in grammar &lsquo;mūrdhābhişikta&rsquo; exainples (i. e. stock examples ) not necessarily contemporaneous with the author but handed down traditionally. Patanjali himself speak&rsquo;s of murdhabhişiktam-udābarañain' (Kielhorn&rsquo;s ed. Vol. 1. p. 144 on Pån. I. 1. 57). In the very first passage &lsquo;Candrannan tasabhå&rsquo; is certainly such an example, since even if Patan att be assigned to 150 B.O., Candragupta flourished at least 1500 years before him and Patañjali could not have known it personal but</p>

<p>only by tradition or hearsay. Then we have to keep in mind the vicissitudes through which, according to the Vákyapadiya ( II. verses 484-490 ) of Bhartphari, the Malābhāsya passed in the early centuries of the Christian era. It is narrated there that &ldquo;Sangraha (a very extensive work on Pāņini&rsquo;s grammar attributed to Vyādi) was practically lost, that the great teacher Patažījali composed a work called Mahābhāşya containing the seeds of all nyāyas, but persons with undeveloped intellects could not ascertain its import, that Baiji, Saubhava and Haryakşa flooded that work of the sage (viz. Patañjali) by following baseless reasonings. The traditional interpretation of (Sanskrit) grammar which slipped from the disciples of Patañjali remained in course of time among the southern people merely in the form of a work ( in Manuscripts). After securing the tradition from a mountain (in the south ) Caudrãoárya and others following the essence of the bhāşya made it blossom forth in various ways.' 1026</p>
<p>The Vākyapadiya is certainly not later than 600 A.D., though there are some scholars who place it not later than tho 3rd century A. D. (vide, for example, Shri Sadhu Ram in J. G. J. R. I. Vol. IX pp. 135-151). Whatever the date of the Vakya padiya, we cannot be certain that the present Mss. and editions of the Mahābhāsya represent an exact reproduction of wliat Patañjali composed. All that I want to emphasise is that we should not be cocksure about the date of the Mahābhäsya and not regard 150 B. C. as a certain date for Patañjali&rsquo;s Mahābhāsya but should regard it only a possible or at the most a probable one.</p>
<p>Then as to the period of two centuries at least between Patañjali and Kätyāyana and between Katyāyana and Panini suggested by Dr. Ram Gopal, I have to urge certain objections. Pāṇini&rsquo;s family is said to have been living in Salatura in North West India (supposed to be mentioned in Pāṇ. IV. 3. 94) and Panini is designated Salāturlya by later classical writers like Bhāmaha ( in Kavyālankāra VI. 62-63). Salātura is identified by Cunningham in ‘Ancient Geography of India' pp. 66-67 with Lahur, a small town north-west of Ohind in the angle</p>

<p>botween the Kabul river and the Indus. Kātyāyana (the author of Vārtikas ) is supposed to have been a dākṣiṇātya on account of a rather jocular 112cl remark of the Mahābhāsya on the first Vārtika. There were no printing presses in those days and works were propagated by means of oral transmission or by making inanuscripts and by the process of learned and ambitious writers visiting royal courts or rich men and parişads or samitis. For example, in the Br. Up. Vi. 2 and Chāndogya Up. (V. 3 )102e Svetaketu Aruneya is said to have repaired to the Parişad or Samiti of the Pancāla people or country (between the foot of the Himālayas and the river Yamunā) and a Rājanya asked him five questions. Learned Brāhmanas were a specially favoured class in ancient India. Learned works froin one part of Bhārata spread quickly to even distant parts of the country in a short time on account of the visits of learned men to subhus patronized by kings, their ininisters and rich men. Rājasekhara (about 900 A. D.) in his Kāvyaniināṁsā (chap. XX pp. 54-55) gives valuable information. He says that the king should convenie asseinblios of poets and when the king is a poet all people becomo poets. The king should construct a hall for examining poems and that be should emulate 1021 (kings like ) Vāsudeva, Sātavā hana, Sudraka, Sähasānka and others (who presided over sabhās in their days ) by bestowing honours and gifts, that between itssemblies for discussions about poetic works he should order discussions in Sastras. The king should arrange meetings of brāhmaṇas for exainining the worth of poetic and Sāstric works and quotes two verses, one referring to the examination of poets liko Kālidāsa and Bharavi in Ujjaiyini and the other referring to writers on Sästrus in Pätaliputra and uxpressly names Panini, Vyā:li, Vararuci (Kātyāyana ) and Patanjali as having been examined. Thus there were even in ancient times means for rapid transmission of really valuable works to distant lands.</p>

<p>History of Dharmastistra</p>
<p>on two circumstances viz. considerable change in Sanskrit idiom between Pāṇini&rsquo;s time and Kātyāyana&rsquo;s time and ( secondly ) much time must have passed before a grammar composed in Northwest India could become so popular as to induce an author from the South to compose Vārtikas thereon. The first circums tance is worth little. Even in these days of the diffusion of primary education, daily newspapers, railways, radio progra mmes, a regional language like Marathi spoken in Berar and Khandesh varies in some details from the same language as spoken in Poona, Satara and the Konkan. The changos noted by Katyāyana are not at all fundamental. Päpini himnself refers to many differences and mentions by name ten predecos sors viz. Apisali (Vi. 1. 92), Käsyapa (1. 2. 25, VIII. 68). Gárgya (VIII. 3. 20, VIII. 4. 67), Gālava (VI. 3. 61, VIII. 4. 67). Cakravarmaņa (VI. I. 130), Bhāradvāja (VII.2.63), Sākatāyana (III. 4. 111, VIII. 3. 18, VIII. 4. 50 ), Sakalya (1. 1. 16, VI. 1. 127, VIII. 37. 9, VIII. 4. 51 ), Senaka (V. 4. 112), Sphotāyana (VI. 1. 123). Pāṇini, moreover, refers to &lsquo;Ācāryas&rsquo; in general in VII. 3, 49 and VIII. 4. 52. He also speaks of eastern ācāryas in III. 4. 18 and northern ācāryas in VI. 3. 32 (mâtara-pitara udicām &lsquo;). This last citation shows that, though Panini cane himself from northwest India, Sanskrit was spoken even in tho Extreme north much beyond Pāṇini&rsquo;s home and the people used the form &lsquo;Mātarapitarau ' instead of &lsquo;Mātāpitarau&rsquo; as required by Pāṇini. This state of things existed even before Pāṇini in the time of Yāska, who states that the verbal forin Savati is used by the Kamboja people in the sense of &lsquo;gati&rsquo;, but only a derivative from it viz. sayaḥ&rsquo; is used by the Arya people (and not the verbal form ). This shows that in Yāsku&rsquo;s time the Kambojas were not accepted as Āryas, though their language was basically the same as that of the Aryas. 1028</p>
<p>Haradatta 102 he says what was not present to the mind of the Sūtrakāra (Panini) or what was not noticed by him is clearly stated by the Vákyakāra (Katyāyana ) and the Blasyakára ( clearly states ) what was not noticed by the Vakyakära. To illustrate, Pånini says &lsquo;Kambojāl-luk&rsquo; (IV. 1.-175) meaning that the king of Kamboja is called Kamboja. Katyayana adds &amp;</p>

Patan jali in his Bhäsya specifies &lsquo;Coda, Karlera and Kerala&rsquo; as the words included in Kambojādi-gana but in the Ganapatha at the end of the Siddhantakaumudi (Nir, ed. of 1929 ) Saka and Yavana are further additions to the words of that gana. Pänini dwelling in north-West India either forgot to include Cola (or Coda) and Kerala or did not know those names or it is possible that those nainos were first coined about the time of Pāņini or even after him but Kátyāyana coming later and being a southernor included Coun (or Cola) and Kerala. This shows how the Gana pātha ag now printed is not necossarily valid for Pāpini&rsquo;s time,</p>
<p>The 2nd circumstance relied upon by Dr. Ram Gopal has been answered above by reference to the role of parişads and by what kings should do and did in ancient India for the encoura gement and diffusion of Sanskrit literature,</p>
<p>Panini mentions ten predecessors by name, besides eastern und northern ãcāryas. But Katyāyana mentions only a few names such as Pauşkarasīdi (Vārtika 3 on Pan. VIII, 4, 48 ), Vājapyāyana (Vārtika 35 on Pāṇ. I. 2. 64 ), Vyādi (Vārtika 45. on Pån. I. 2. 64). I am aware that Patañjali notices different readings in the Vårtikas (on which he comments) such as by the Saunigas (about 6 times) and by the Bhiradvājiyas ( about ten times ). But considering the huge number 112i of Vārtikas On the Astādbyāyi this is a mere flea-bite. Similarly, it appears that a few Vārtikas other than those of Kätyāyana existed in Patanjali&rsquo;s day. Taking all these things into consideration, Kātyāyana may be said to have flourished one hundred years or at the most 150 years before Patañjali i. e. 300 B. C.-250 B. C., conceding for argument that Patañjali flourished about 150 B. C. But if Patanjali is held to have flourished in the first century A. D., Katyāyana would have to be brought down to about 150 B.O. to 100 B.O.</p>
<p>If Kātyāyana is placed at about 300 B. C.-250 B, C. Pāniu should be placed at 450 B. C.-400 B. C.</p>

<p>but rather in the later phases of it. A few references to some of Pänini&rsquo;s sūtras on literary works and a few other matters will be helpful in arriving at a tentative date for Pānini. Pāṇini says &lsquo;Purāņaprokteņu brāhmanakalpesu&rsquo; (IV. 3. 105), which means the affix nini is applied to Brāhmaṇa works and Kalpa works, provided these are declared by ancient (inunis ). The oxamples are Bhāllavinaḥ and Sātyāyaninah from Bhallu and Satyāyana. This clearly shows that in Pāṇini&rsquo;s times there were sātra works both ancient and not ancient (i, e. composed nearer his time ).</p>
<p>According to Pāṇini IV. 3. 105 as it stands the termination nini would not apply to Brāhmana works and Kalpasūtras that were not ancient. Kātyāyana adds a vārtika that &lsquo;wini&rsquo; will not apply to Yājñavalkya&rsquo;s and other Brāhmanas though they are equally purāņaprokta (and so we shall have &lsquo;Yajnavalkāni&rsquo; and &lsquo;Saulabhāni&rsquo; Brāhmaṇāni. The Kāśikā says that it is reported in the ākhyānas that Yājavalkya and others do not belong to old times and the sūtrakāra acts on that. 1021 An example of an ancient Kalpa is Paingikalpa. Then there are the two sūtras Pārāśarya-silalibhyām bhikṣunatasūtrayoh&rsquo; and ‘Karmandakşśāsvād-inih&rsquo; (IV, 3.110-111). These show that before Pāṇini wrote Bhikşu-sūtras by Pārāśarya and Karmanda and Natasūtras by Silalin and Křśāśva had baen composed While Baud. Dh.S. (II. 1. 43-44) includes among Upapātakas the profession of actors (rangopajivana) and the profession of</p>

<p>Brāhmanäni' and &lsquo;Saulabhāni&rsquo;. What are these? The present writer suggests that Yajnavalkāni are those passages of the ;)k. Up. (11, 2-3, IV. 1-4) in which Yājnavalkya propounds perennial philosophy to Janaka and other questioners, Saulabhāni Brāhmanāni may he those passages of the Br. Up. (II. 4 and IV.5) in which Maitreyi is instructed by Vājāavalkya. Sulabhā Maitreyi is one of the three women to wboru water is offered in the tarpana. The Br. Up, is divided into six adbyāyas and each adhyāya is divided into parts called brāhmanas, From this interpretation, if accepted by scholars, it would follow that in Panini&rsquo;s time the Br. Up. passages mentioned above were not regarded as composed hy a cirantana sage but in Kätyāyana&rsquo;s days, those Passages had come to be regarded as old and therefore Kātyāyana had to frame a special vārtika about them.

<p>the teaching of danoing (Nátyācārya), these facts amount to this that before Panini and in his day also the profession of actors appears to have been not looked down upon in North-West India, while Baudhāyana, an inhabitant of the southern parts of India ( as I noted ), looked down upon it.</p>
<p>Panini has the gūtra adhikrtya křte granthe' (IV. 3. 87) and then follows &lsquo;Siśukranda-Yamasabha-dvandvendrajananā dibhyas-chah.'(IV. 3. 88 ), which means that the affix &lsquo;cha&rsquo; (i. o. Iya) is added to denote a book composed with reference to children&rsquo;s cries, the assoinbly of Yama, dvandva compounds and words in the Indra-jananādi-gana (0. g. Siśukrandiya, Yama sabhiya, Kirātārjuniya, Indrajananiya etc.). This shows that much secular literature had already been produced in Panini&rsquo;s days. A Vārtika may be mentioned in connection with the date of Pánini. The sütra is &lsquo;adhikstya krte granthe (Pán. IV. 3.87) and the vârtika is . Lubākhyāyikābhyo bahulam&rsquo;. Tho. sūtra states as a general rule that works composed with reference to something have the affix &lsquo;aņ&rsquo;(a) added to the word denoting the matter e. g. a work concerning Subhadrā would be called Saubhadra. Kātyāyana says that in the case of the literary genre called Akhyāyikās this termination is in most cases not added. Patañjali cites the names of two literary works called Akhyāyikās viz. Vasavadatta and Sumanottarā, 102k where the termination is not found but also names an ākhyāyikā oalled Bhaimarathi where the termination an&rsquo; was applied.</p>
<p>The above shows that in Pāṇini&rsquo;s time ākhyáyikās existed and they ended in the affix aạ, while Kätyāyana know many akhyāyikās (mark the plural) which showed no termination.</p>

This is useless as it is not the army that is relevant in the work here but the people dwelling on the banks of the river. Rg. poets looked upon great rivers as goddesses, implored them to aceept their prayer (Rg. X.75. 5-6 ) and state that Sarasvati vanquishes their enemies (Rg. II.30.8). It should be noted that Vedic mantras are prescribed for some purposes not actually expressed in them, but even op the basis of a single word that has somo remote connection with the act for which it is prescribed. For example, the Mantra satyenotta bhita bhūmih&rsquo; &amp;c., which is Ap. Mantrapātha 1.6.1 and which occurs in Rg. X. 85. 1. and Atharvaveda XIV, 1, 1 (but not in Tai. S.) is recited (acc. to Ap.

<p>for Salva people and the other verse for brahmanas and referenos to river (in the vocative ) on which they reside is to be made. The author of Ap. Gr. found two verses in the Mantrapātha of nearly the same import and having nearly the same words. He had to assign &amp; proper viniyoga to each of the two verses. Straightforwardly construed, acc. to Ap. Gr. the first verse (in which &lsquo;Sálvíh&rsquo; are expressly mentioned ) should be sung in the case of all people of Sālva country (whether brāhmanas, ksatriyas or vaisyas ) and the 2nd verse was to be sung in the case of brāhmaṇas (other than Sälva brahmanas). This leaves a lacuna viz, what verse, if any, is to be sung for Ksatriyas and Vaiyyas who do not belong to the Sälva country. It is possible that brāhmanas are meant to be only illustrative (pradarsanar tham ) i. e. brāhmanas and others not belonging to the Salva country should employ the 2nd verse. It would be seen how several interpretations are given by Haradatta and Sudarsanā. carya on account of these difficulties. Among the first twelve verses in Ap. M. P. II. 11 five are common to both Rg. and Tai. S. and two (viz. verses 10-11 ) occur in Rg., Atharvaveda and Tai. S. That shows that the Āp. M. P., though collected for Apastambiyas, could be drawn upon or referred to by others who were not Apastambiyas but studied soine other śakhí. Siman tonnayana was a practice common to all persons (at loast of the three varnas ) in those days. It should be noted that anong the gphyasūtras there is great divergence about the details of Simantonnayana and about the verge to be sung. Ašvalayana. (I. 14. 6-7), Hiraṇyakeğin, Baud. Gr. (1. 10.9), Bhāradvāja and Paraskara (I. 15. 7-8) prescribe in this sainskāra only one verse and that too in honour of king Soma and no mention is made of sālvik' as in Āp. Gr. S. These Gr. sūtras were not bound to follow strictly the Apastambiya Mantrapātha, while Äp.Gr, was so bound. It is also remarkable that the Gr. gūtras of Gobhila, Khadira, Laugikși and Vaikhānasa are silent avon about the singing of a particular verse by lute players. Paras kara says that acc. to some the verse appointed (i. o. prescribed. niyukta,) must be sung. Pāraskara probably refers by this to the Āp. Gr. simply because in the Ap. M. P. (which is a compil ation made by somebody who is not now definitely known) a verse occurs in which Sälva people are mentioned and because that verse (one of two verses ) prescribed by Ap. Gr. was gung in Simantonnayana, it would be a wild conjecture on the part of anybody including Dr. Ram Gopal to say that the author of Gr. 8. came from the Sálva country. Owing to the defectos</p>

<p>I must say a few words about another recent work on Dharmasūtras. Dr. S. C. Banerji (of Maulana Azad College, Calcutta) recently published in 1962 ) a work on &lsquo;Dharma sutras, a study in their origin and development&rsquo;. He has summarised in the first 73 pages the contents of a portion of my History of Dharmaśāstra (published so far back as 1930 ) that dealt with the Dharniasūtras, quotes from them and refers to them dozens of times (sometimes four or five times on the same page). He is fond of adding sage remarks of which a few specimens are quoted below, though he admits on p. 7 (n. 1) ' for chronological questions relating to the works, we have taken Kane ( HDH Vol. I) as the chief authority. The work comprises several articles which Dr. Banerji contributed to some journals at different times. For example he contributed reconstruction of Hārsta-dharmasūtra in J.O.I. (Baroda, 1958) pp. 14-37, which, with a few additions, appears in his work on pp. 257-287, re-construction of Atri, Cyavana, Bhāradvāja and Devala in JOI. (Baroda) Vol. VI, now represented in Dharma gutras &lsquo;etc. pp. 244-257; reconstruction of Ušanas in ABORI vol. 39, pp. 85-100 ( 1953 ) now appears in Dharmasutras&rsquo; as pp. 340-44, &lsquo;Flora and Fauna of Dharmasütras &lsquo;in J. O. I. ( Baroda ) vol. V, pp. 345-359 are set out now in &lsquo;Dharnasūtrasi pp. 206-228. He is more in collector than a scholar doing original and thorough research on his own account. He has given useful tables and appondices for workers on Sanskrit studies. He often writes rather pompously and does little arduous or valuable research himself. More than thirty-five years ago, 1 collected passages from Sankha-Lik hitasūtra (published in ABORI vol. VII-VIII) found in printed works. Since then &amp; good many works on Dharnia-śāstra have been printed. He does not make an effort to supplement what was not included by me and yet remarks (on p. 239 n. 1)&lsquo;P. V.

To Upanayana and Vivāha he devotes pp. 73-80, to Srāddha pp. 81-85, to Ašauon pp. 85-89 and to Dravyasuddhi pp. 89-95; B. Prayascitta, con cept of Prayascitta, classification of sins and modes of expiation; all this is disposed of in pp. 95-99. Then C: Vyavahāra includ ing judicial procedure, inheritance and succession and partition are allotted pp. 109-120; D. Rājadharma is disposed of in pp. 121-125. Social, cultural, religious and economic conditions reflected in Dharmasūtras are discussed under ten heads viz. Varnāśramadharma; system of education; food and drink; position of women; law and administration; religion and philo sophy; Apaddharma; manners, morals, customs and amusements; Brahmanical supremacy and position of śüdras; economic life: all these are given in pp. 126-265. On p. 73 ( note 1 ) he is plea sed to observe &lsquo;P. V. Kane in his HDH Vol. II. briefly indicates the contents of this literature in tracing the evolution of a parti cular rite, custom or institution from the earliest times through different stages. But, as is usual in a work like his, there is no systematic, critical and comparative study of the contents of Dharmasūlras in it. The present attempt is made with a view to 52.pplying this need.&rsquo; Although he refers in the Bibiliography at the end of the book (on p. 54 ) to the History of Dharınašāstra ( Vol. 1-V ), it appears to me that he has either not read volumes III to V of that History or ignored them with what motives I cannot understand. Vol. III was published in 1946, Vol. IV in 1953 and Vol. V part I in 1958, at least several years before his present volume (published in 1962 ). There is not a single reference, so far as I could see, to those volumes in pp. 73-205. The subject of śråddha which he disposes of in four pages (81-85) was treated by me in Vol. IV pp. 334-551 by tracing its history from Vedic times, in the sūtras, Smộtis and comparatively modern works; the subject of Prāyaścittas, sins and expiations w88 dealt with in Vol. IV pp. 1-178, which he disposed of in pp.95-99. Asauca to which Dr. Banerji assigned four pages was dealt with hy nie in the same volume (IV) at pp. 267-309 and Drayya. suddhi in Vol. IV pp. 309-333. Dr. Banerji spares for Vyaya. hára (including judicial procedure, inheritance, succession, partition) pp. 109-120 and for Rajadharma pp. 121-125 ). while I devote pp. 1-241 in Vol. III. to Rājadharma anche begin it with a summary of what Āp. Dh. S. states and I treat &ldquo;Vyavahāra&rsquo; in pp. 242-824 (in Vol. III). How far he attempts &lsquo;a systematic, oritical and comparatite</p>

<p>History of Dharmasastra</p>
<p>study of the contents of the Dharmasūtras &lsquo;(to quote his own words ) in his book is for Sanskrit scholars to judge. I should like to say (begging his pardon) that he appears to me to be a conceited writer. I shall set out only one but an important instance. In the first vol. of H. of Dh. I devoted pp. 213-221 to Katyāyana. I began by calling him one of a triumvirate in the realm of ancient Hindu Law and proceduro and based my remarks on quotations contained in a dozen works and authors. I stated (on p. 213 ) that Kātyāyana appears to have taken Nárada and Bphaspati as his models in the treatment of Vyavahāra. I referred to a work called Karmapradipa of Katyāyana in Jivananda&rsquo;s collection of Smộtis and hold (on p. 221 ) that that author is different from Kātyāyana, the Jurist. In 1933 I published “Kātyāyana-smộtisároddhāra&rsquo; in which I brought together 973 verses of Kātyāyana on Vyavahāra alone, extracted from twenty works, which work is mentioned by Dr. Banerji in his Bibliography on p. 542. Later on Prof. Ranga Swami Aiyangar collected over a hundred verses of Katyayana the jurist and published them in one of the papers presented to me on my 61st birthday (vide Kane Festschrift pp. 7–17). About Kätyayana the jurist with whom I dealt on pp. 213-218 (in Vol. I. of H. of Dh.) I stated &lsquo;All known quotations of Katyayana are in verse&rsquo; (p. 218 ). About this Dr. Banerji on p. 241 of his work remarks that Kane is not accurate when he asserts that * all known&hellip;&hellip; Verse&rsquo; and in connection with my remark about Medhātithi&rsquo;s reference to a sūtra of Kātyāyana that we must either suppose that he ( Medhätithi) is referring to some other work of Kātyāyana than the one in verse from which hundreds of verges are cited by other writers or that Katyāyana&rsquo;s work on Vyavahāra also contained some prose passages&rsquo; (p. 218), Dr. Banerji remarks (pp. 241-42 ) that I am not right in drawing the inference and that &lsquo;our collection of prose passages attributed to Katyāyana by different writers proves conclusively that neither of the inferences of Kane is tenable&rsquo;. My first inference based on Medhātithi quoting a sūtra of Katyāyana was that Katyayana also wrote another work in sūtra style. Dr. Banerji says this inference is wrong. Then it follows that Katyayana did not write another work in prose. My second inference was that Kătyāyana&rsquo;s work on Vyavahāra might have contained prose passages. This, he says, is wrong; if so, it follows that Kātyāyana&rsquo;s Vyavabăra did not contain prose passages. He is inconsistent in this.

<p>statos about Katyāyana &quot; it may be pointed out that Kane does not mention the fact that to this author are ascribed sūtras also in addition to verses on Smrti&rdquo;. Before saying anything more I shall examine the prose extracts from Kátyāyana which Dr. Banerji sets out on pp. 295-296. They are only eleven and taken from seven digests and commentaries. His method seeins to lo to take up printed Sanskrit nibandhas and commentaries and look at the Index of names of authors quoted or to read hurriedly some passages and when the name Kātyāyana (or any other writer about whom he wants to write ) appears, to put it down in his collection without troubling to trace it to its sourco. set out the quotations in the learned author&rsquo;s own order.</p>

<p>Manu III. 85.) Dr. Banerji forgets or ignores that Kātyāyana is a name borne by several eminent authors. There is Kātyāyana, author of the Vārtikas on Pāṇini, who is held to have flourished some conturies before the Christian era, there is an extensive Kat yang-brautasūtra which also is a work of a period before the Christian era. I dealt with a third Katyāyana in H. of Dh. VotI</p>
<p>History of Dharmasastra</p>
<p>who was a jurist and whom I assigned to the period between the 4th and 6th century A. D. (p. 218 of vol. I, ed. of 1930 ). Dr. Banerjee appears to accept this date (p. 242 of his work). If the learned doctor had carefully read the prose passages attributed to Kātyāyana in medieval nibandhas set out by hini on pp. 295-296, he would have found that all of them refer to snāna, śrāddha and none refers to law and judicial procedure at all. A cautious scholar would have paused before fathering those passages on Kātyāyana the jurist. The doctor&rsquo;s reading is neither deep nor vast and, not being cautious, he gives free rein to his imagination. The doctor has probably not read or heard that there is a pariţista in nine kandikās attributed to Katyāyana and attached to the Pāraskaragrhyasūtra (which also is spoken of as Kātiya). I shall show that most of the prose passages he sets out (on pp. 295-296 ) as Kātyāyana&rsquo;s oocur in that Parisista (Gujarati Progs ed. of 1917 )* as follows :</p>

(kāņds 2, kandika 3. &lsquo;Gayatrim, brahmaņāya - nubrüyāt, Tristubham rājanyasya, Jagatím vaisyasya, sarveşăm vă Gayatrim&rsquo;, 7-10). It should be noted that Aparárka (p. 33 ) quotes from kātyāyana the passage &lsquo;Gayatryā, tristtubba &hellip;&hellip; jagaty&hellip;. sarveşām vā gāyatrim&rsquo;; the passage as quoted in the Krtyakalpataru is almost the same as in Pār. Gr. and is attri buted to Katyāyana by Aparār a probably because the Par. Gr. is also called Kātiya Gr. and, as shown above (p. 18), Pāraskara is another name of Kātyāyana. No. 9 Sauvarya&hellip;&hellip;putādişu vā occurs in the Sraddhasūtra, Kandikā 2 (p. 443.

<p>The editor notes that the mos, of Krtyakalpataru does not attributes No. 8 to Kātyāyana, but as Aparārka on p. 33 attributes av almost identical passage to Kātyāyana, his name is inserted by the editor before this passage. The passage as read by Aparārka is : D गायत्रीम्। अनुयादिति शेष:. The Krtyakalpataru probably suthmerikes Plr. Gr. in its own words,</p>

<p>these words of Kullūka are an echo of Katyāyana - srauta - gūtra VI. 10. 20-24 &lsquo;pratinigadya homāḥ&hellip;svābākārapradanah.&rsquo; The two passages (2,7) out of eleven are so brief that to find their source is like searching for &amp; pin in a haystack. I had to spend hours in tracing the sources of these passages. All these passages, it is clear, do not refer to any juridical matter. Dr. Banerji has often stated as shown above that I had not proved conclusively my propositions. I hope that scholars will concede that I have conclusively proved at least one thing viz. what Dr. Banerji regarded (on p. 242, line 4) as con clusively proved by him has been conclusively proved to be wrong. After this exhibition of his carefulness and scholarship I do not want to expose his vanity and shallowness. He is very anxious to impress on his readers his cleverness and industry. On page 229 of H. of Dh. I, I briefly dealt with Pracetas and remarked that in both Mit. and Aparārka we find prose passages and verses cited from Pracetas. At the end I said a few prose quota tions from Pr. are noted in the Smrtioandrika and by Haradatta. On p. 242 Dr. Banerji could not avoid saying in his usual manner</p>
<p>Kane is not absolutely accurate in holding that a few proge quotations etc.' He cites about 61 passages (prose) from Pracetas of which 34 are extracted from the Mit, Aparārka and Smrtioan drikā to which works I had expressly referred. In order to reduce the bulk of the volume I did not set out any prose passages. That is all. I never said that only a few prose passages of Pracetas are known to nibandhas.</p>
<p>The commentary of Haradatta called Ujjvala-vřtti is the only one so far recovered. For an account of Haradatta, vide sec. 86. The Smrticandrikā (I, page 25 ) quotes a passage from the bhūsya of Apastamba (11.6.15.19-20) and (II p.300) quotes the explana tion of the bhāsyakára on Ä pastamba II. 6, 14. 1. Both these passages are not found in the commentary of Haradatta, though in the latter case, Haradatta holds the same view as that of the Bhāsyakāra. Similarly, the Viramitrodaya' (Vyavahāra, page 671) quotes the bhâsyakāra of Āpastamba, but that quotation does not agree with Haradatta. Haradatta himself does not call his work bhāsya, but vrtti. Besides, the Subodhini on the Mitāksarā (on Vai II. 132 ) quotes a passage from the Apastambadharma vrtti which is found in Haradatta on Āp. II. 6. 14. 1. Haradara himself oites sometimes two or three other interpretations on the game sūtra (e. g. on Ap. I. 2. 5. 2; I. 3. 10. 6; I. 5. 15. 20:12 3 16).

<p>It appears from the Kalpataru of Lakşmidhara that Kapardin wrote a bhāsya on Ap. Dh. S. e. g. the Brahmacāri kānda of that work on p. 15 quotes Āp. Dh. S. II. 2. 1, 2-5 and remarka &lsquo;etacca nityānām-eva karmanām phalāntaram-iti Kapardibhäsyam&rsquo;; also on p. 257 it quotes Āp. Dh. S. I. 3. 11. 27 34 and cites एकसकः एकचरः शृगाल इति कपर्दी. Laksmidhara on Sraddha cites the explanation of Āp. Dh. S. II. 7.17. 21 &lsquo;Svitri&hellip;sūdrot. panno brāhmanyāmityete sraddhe&hellip;panktidīgaņā bhavanti&rsquo; and Haradatta seems to have taken it from Kapardin. In Naiyatakāla-kanda it quotes Kapardibhāşya on Āp. Dh. S. I. 17. 37 (pp. 239 and 306 ); on pp. 275-6 Āp. Dh. S. I. 2. 7. 19-21 are quoted and Kapardibhäşya on Ugratah sūdrato vāharet' is quoted. From a corrupt passage in Mr. Gharpure&rsquo;s edition of the Smrticandrikā ( 2nd part p. 419 ) it follows that Dhūrta svāmin had either composed a bhāsya on Āp. Dh. S. (the reference is to Ap. Dh. I. 5. 17. 18 and 20 suktam ca' and</p>
<p>Suktam cāparayogam' or that he had in some other work referred to Āp. aphorisms and explained them. Dhūrtasvāmin wrote a bhāsya on the Srauta-sūtra of Āpastamba, the first vol. of which was published in G. O. S. in 1956.</p>
<p>In Aparārka, Haradatta, Smộticandrikā and other works there are numerous quotations in verse ascribed to Āpastamba. These quotations are concerned with topics of Āhnika, Srāddha, and Prāyaścitta. The Smộticandrikā (III. pp. 423 and 426 ) quotes a Stotrāpastamba. Haradatta on Gautama (22. 18 ) quotes several verses on prāyaścitta from Āpastamba. Threo of these verses are found in the Apastamba-smrti in verse (Jivananda&rsquo;s collection vol. I pp. 567-584 chap. I verses 16, 19, 31 ). The Smrti printed by Jivananda contains about 207 verses in ten chapters on prāyaścitta and purifications. But the quota tions from the Smrticandrikā and Aparārka show that the verse Āpastamba was a much larger work and since they regarded the versified work as equally authoritative with the sūtra work, the versified smrti must have been comparatively an ancient work,</p>
<p>Shri. A. N. Krishna Aiyangar in Kunhan Raja Felicitation Volume (pp. 392–397 ) points out that there are some additional sūtras of Āp. Dh. S. In the Rangaswami Aigangar Comh Korb (pp. 367-369 ) an account is given of an Apastambasmrti pagal Adyar Library in six patalas and 800 grantha.</p>

<p>Hiranyakosi-dharmasūtra. The Hiraụyakeši-dharmasūtra forms the 26th and 27th praśnus of the Hiranyakeśi-kalpa. The Srauta-gütra has been published by the Anandāśrama Press (Poona ). The Hiranya koši-gļhya-sutra was edited with extracts from the cominentary of Mātrdatta by Dr. Kirsto ( Vienna, 1889). The Gșhya forms the 19th and 20th praśnas of the Kalpa, each praśna being divided into eight patalas. The Srauta-sūtra is largely based on the Srauta-sūtra of Āpastamba Tho Gșhya-sūtra is indebted to the Gļhya-sutra of Bhäradvāja. The Dharmasutra of Hiranyakośin can hardly be called an independent work. Hundrods of sūtrus are borrowed word for word from the Apas tambil Dharınasūtra. The Dharnasūtra of Hirapyakešin ia therefore the oldest voucher for the authenticity of Apastamba&rsquo;s text and is very valuable for checking the latter.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The Hiranyakaśins forni a sütra-carana of the Khåndikeya section of the Taittiriyaśākhā and were formed later than the Apastambiya School. In a grant of the Kongu kings dated in 454 A. D. Brāhmaṇas of the Hiraṇyakeği School are mentioned (I. A. vol. V. page 136 ). According to the Mahārņava quoted in the commentary of the Caranavyuha, the Hiranyakeśins were to be found in the south-west between the Sahya mountain and the ocean and near Parasurama (i. e, in the Konkan). There are at present many Brāhmaṇas in the Ratnagiri District who call themselves Hiranyakeģins. The Dattaka-mlmāmgā of Nanda-pandita twice quotes passages from the commentary of Śabarasyāmin on the sūtra of Satyāsādha. If he was identical with the great commentator of the Pūrva-mimamsā (which is almost certain ), then we would have unimpeachable evidence for the existence of the works of the Hiraṇyakośins long before 200-400 A. D.</p>
<p>Bühler in his second edition of the Āpastamba-dharmasutra (1893) gave (in appendix II) the various readings of the Hirapyakeģi-dharmasūtra from two MSS. I secured a modern transcript of the Hiranyakeģi-dharmasūtra from the Deccan College collection (No. 138 of 1881-82 ), which contains the text and also the commentray of Mahādeva thereon. There are 18 folios for the sūtra and 101 for the commentary. That he is presents some readings which are not noticed by Bühler as foi in the two mss. consulted by him. For examplo, the us. reads &ldquo;saptama āyuşkāmamaştame brahmavarcasakāınam (revorvidtHistory of Dharmaśāstra</p>
<p>the order of years in Āp. I. 1. 1. 21-22 ), omits the words &ldquo;yadi gnāyāt dandavat plavet&rdquo; (from Āp. I. 1. %. 30.), reads &lsquo;vastrin yeva vasitobhaya &amp;c.&rsquo; (Ap. I. 1. 3. 9 omits vasita), reads &lsquo;gurave&rsquo; for &lsquo;ācāryāya&rsquo; in Ap. I. 1. 3. 31. The ms. of the Hiranyakeši-dharmasūtra contains certain additions to the sūtras of Apastamba. For example, a sūtra &lsquo;kşāralavapa madhumāmsäni ca varjayet&rsquo; is added after Ap. II. 9. 22. 14, a sūtra &lsquo;tesām pūjā śroyasyātmanaḥ käryä&rsquo; occurs after Ap. II. 9. 25. 8, and the sūtra &lsquo;sarva-dharmāņām svadharmānusthānā. niyameşu ca yuktah syat&rsquo; occurs after Āp. II. 9.25. 13. The manuscript contains a few verses, that are not found in the Apastamba-dharmasūtra, introduced by the words &lsquo;athāpyu daharanti 103, (except in one case viz. putrena, &amp;c.). The manuscript also omits certain sūtras found in Äp. 0. 8.</p>
<p>varpajyāyasām cetarair yarņaih&rsquo;( Āp. II. 5. 11.8), &lsquo;anyatra rāhudarganāt&rsquo; (Ap. II. 7. 17. 25), &lsquo;athopanayanam tata udakopasparśanam&rsquo; (Ap. 1. 1. 1. 36.). In the case of some sütras the readings of Hiranyakeśin present a smoother and more classical Sanskrit than that of Āpastamba and are mani. festly attempts to bring them in line with the requirements of the šistas at the time when the Apastambasūtras were taken over into the Hirangakesi school. Hirapyakešisutra has</p>

Another noticeable feature is that the arrangement of the sūtras into sub-sections is a good deal diffe rent in the two works. Bühler notes that from the 13th khandika (6th patala ) of the second praśpa both the manuscripts consulted by him do not indioate the patalas. The Deccan College manuscript does not number them from the second patala in the second praśna. The number of patalas in the first praśna of Hira yakeši is eight, 103 &lsquo;पशवश्च मुखादाना अश्मा चालषणोध (वृतः । एतद् बाह्मण ते पण्यं तन्तुचारजनी</p>

<p>while Apastamba has eleven patalas in each of the iwo prasnas. The distribution of sūtras in the khavdikās is therefore different in the two works. Hirapyakesi has 31 khandikäs in the first prašna and 20 in the second. Besides, a few of the khandikās are diffo rently placed. The first khandikā of Hiranyakosi (first praśna ) stops after Āp. I. 1.2. 1, the third reaches up to Ap. I. 1. 4.6: Āp. I. 8. 22 and 23 ( the adhyātmāpatala ) come in Hirangakesi immodiately after Ap. I. 6. 19 and are Hirapyao I. 6. 20; Āp. ). 7.20 and 21 = Hir. I. 6. 21-22; Āp. I. 9. 24 and 25. 1-4 = Hir. 1. 6. 23; Āp. I. 9. 25. 4-13 and I. 9. 26. 1-10 = Hir. I. 7. 24 ; Āp. I. 9. 26. 11-14 and 1. 9. 27 = Hir. I. 7.25; Āp. I. 10. 28 = Hir. I 7. 26; Ap.

II. 4. 8-9 are placed in Hiranyakeši before Āp. II. 3. 6-7 and Ap. II. 6. 13-15 beforo Āp. II. 5. 10-11. Sometimes a single sutra of Apastamba is split up into two and placed in two different khandikās, o. g. Ap. I. 9. 25. 4 is split into Hir.

<p>The com. of Mahadeva Dikşita called Ujjvalā, is almost word iar word the samo as that of Haradatta&rsquo;s Ujjvala. That one has borrowed from the other admits of no doubt and Bühler thinks that Mahā deva is the borrower. But there is hardly anything to turn the scales in favour of Haradatta. Sometimes Mahädeva&rsquo;s commentary contains more matter than Haradatta&rsquo;s (e. g. on the sūtras “Saptame brahmavaroasakāmam &amp;o&rsquo;, &lsquo;Upanayanam vidyārthasya śrutitaḥ&rsquo;, &lsquo;dvādaśāvarardhyam&rsquo; and sometimes Haradatta contains more explanation (e. g. on &lsquo;tasminsoa vidyākarnāntain&rsquo; &amp;c.; on &lsquo;nāpsu slāghamānaḥ snīyāt&rsquo;, on</p>
<p>pānisamkşubdhenodakenaika &amp;c.&rsquo;. Mahādova differs from Haradatta&rsquo;s explanation of the word ' atha', which the former takes in the sense of &lsquo;ānantarya or adhikara&rsquo;, while the latter takes it only in the sense of &lsquo;ānantarya&rsquo;. That Mahadeva also is an early writer follows from the fact ( noted by Buhler p. 117 m) that portions of his commentary are contained in the Munich Ms. of Haradatta dated Vikrama-Samvat 1668 (1611-12 A.D.). It is to be noted that Haradatta after saluting Ganeša at the beginning of bis Ujjvalā does obeisance to Mahādeva ( which may medier God Siva or the author Mahādeva if he was the guru or fall of Haradatta ). Mahadeva often comments on the sutras found in Apastamba and not on the readings of them as existing</p>

<p>in the Hiraṇyakeši school; e. g. he comments on &lsquo;padūnam&rsquo;, ou *adhasanašāyi' for ardhāsanašāyi (the reading of the sūtra ), on &lsquo;ātmasvastyayanārthena&rsquo; (Ap. II. 5. 11. 9 ) for svastyaya lārthena' of the ms. of Hir. The explanations of the two writers sometimes differ, as for example on ācāryādhinas syād anyatra pataniyebhyah' (Ap. I. 1. 2. 19104). One more circum stance that is worthy of note is that the Ujjvalā of Haradatta does not contain many quotations from Smộtis as compared with his commentary on the Gautamadharmasūtra. Although ono may be inclined to hold that it is Mahādova who borrows, it inust be clearly recognized that there is hardly any positivo evidence in support of such a view. There is a commentary called Vaijayanti on the Hiranyakesi-srauta-sūtra. This Malādeva is very likely identical with the Mahadeva who commented upon the dharmagūtra.</p>

<li>Vasistha-dharmasutra. This dlurmusutra has been printed several times. The collec tion of Jivanada (part II, pp. 456-496 ) contains only 20 chapters and a portion of the 21st and so does the collection of Mr. M. N. Dutt (Calcutta 1908). The Anandāśrama collection of sinītis ( 1905, pp. 187-231 ) and the edition of Dr. Führer in the B. S. series (1916) contain thirty chapters. According to Dr. Jolly (R. u 8, p. 6 ) some mss. give only six or ten chapters, The Vasisthadharmasütra with the commentary called Vidvan modini was printed at Benares.

<p>Kunjärila ( vide noto 55 above ) tells us that the dharma sutra of Vasistha was specially studied by the students of tho Rgveda, but that along with other dharmasūtras it is authori tative for all caranas. No srauta and gļhya sūtras of Vasiştha, if they ever existed, have come down to us. We have therefore to fall back upon one of two hypotheses, viz. either the dharma sūtra of Vasistha is the solitary remnant of a school that might have once possessed a complete kalpa or that it was composed as an independent work on dharma and was subsequontly seized upon by the students of the Rgveda, who had only srauta and grhya sűtras of Āśvalāyana.

<p>quotations from all Vedas and beyond the name Vasistha there is hardly anything special in the dharmasūtra to connect it with the Rgveda. It is true that in the 17th chap, several verses of the Rgveda (such as I. 21. 5, 1. 124. 7, V. 4. 10 which occur in gâtras 3, 16 and 4 respectively ) and several passages from the story of Sunahấepa in the Aitareya-brāhmana are quoted by the sūtra and that several hymns of the Rgveda, such as the (Isyavāmiya (Rg. 1. 164 ), havispāntiya (Rg. X. 88), Aghamarsann (X. 190 ), are referred to in the 26th chap. But there is nothing remarkable in this as some of the verses and sūktas are mentioned in the Baudhāyanadharmasūtra also. Besides, the Vas, Dh. S. quotes several passages from the Taittiriyasamhita (as in Vas. V. 7-9, which quote Tai. S. II. 5. 1-6 and Vas. XI. 48 which quotes Tai. S. VI. 3. 10.5), the Satapatha-brāhmann, the Māitrāypiya-samhita (in Vas. I. 37).</p>
<p>The contents of the Vas. Dh. S. are:- I.

<p>The Vas. Dh. S. resembles in several respects the other dharmasūtras described above. It contains almost the same subjects and is similarly composed in prose intersemed with verses. The Vas. Dh. S. is in style like the Gautamadkarm Asutra and has many sûtras identical with or closely resembling those</p>
<ol start="9">
<li>Vasiştha Dharmasūtra</li>
</ol>
<p>gory</p>
<p>of the latter. Vide. p. 18 above. It has also several gūtras closely corresponding with the sūtras of Baudhāyana. Grave doubts have been entertained about the authenticity of the whole of the text of the Vas. Dh. S. as the mss. contain varying numbers of chapters from 6 to 30, and as the text is hopelessly corrupt in several places (e. g. vide note 108 below). The Vas. Dh. S. contains many verses which hear the impress of a comparatively late age. Chapters 25-28 are entirely in verse, while there are other chapters (like llI. 2-12, VI. 1-13, XI. 20-42 ) which contain many verses interposed between prose passages. In this respect Vasiştha&rsquo;s work is on a par with Baudhāyana&rsquo;s, in the fourth praśna of which there are chapters entirely consisting of verses. It has therefore been argued that the text of Vasistha was tampered with freely, particularly as regards the chapters at the end. But as shown below it will have to be admitted that the interpolations, whatever they may be, were made at a very early period. The Mitākṣarā quotes Vas. by name about 80 times and the quotations are taken from almost every chapter from the first to the last. For example, Mit. quotes Vas. 27. 1 on Yāj. III, 310, Vas. 27. 21 on Yāj. III. 323, Vas. 28. ng on Yáj. III. 297, Vas. 28. 18, 19 and 22 on Yāj. III. 309. Even Medhātithi quotes Vasistha over twenty times. The quotations are mostly taken from the first chapter to the 21st. Only one quotation from the last few chapters (viz. 27. 16 ) has been found in Medhātithi (on Manu XI. 211 ) and that too is not quoted as Vasistha&rsquo;s, but is ascribed to others. &lsquo;Višvarūpa, who flourished about the first quarter of the 9th century quotes Vas. about thirty times in his commentary on the ücūra and vyavahūra sections of Yāj. These quotations hardly differ in any respect from the text of Dr. Führer&rsquo;s edition and are scattered over almost all chapters from the 1st to the 17th, six quotations being taken from chapters 3 and 17 each. In the prayasoitta section Višvarūpa quotes Vas. even more frequently. Besides several sutras from the 1st, 4th, 10th and 11th chapters, he quotes here no less than 22 sūtras of the 20th chap. and 9 of the 21st. More over, sūtras 37 and 39 of the 23rd chap. are quoted (on Yäj. lII 281-282). What is more remarkable is that two verses (2-3) of the 28th chapter are ascribed to Vasistha and explained in detail ( on Yāj. III. 256 ), while Vas. 28. 4 is quoted without the author&rsquo;s name. These facts make it certain that the Vas. Då. 8. contained in Višvarūpa&rsquo;s day all the chapters from the fing to the 23rd and also the 28th. Śankara in his bhåsya in Br. Onlar nişad (III. 5. 1 ) quotes Vas. X. 4 and on Bỉ, Up. IV. 5. 15 he</p>
<p>NDED</p>
<p>History of Dharmaśāstro</p>
<p>quotes Vas. VII. 3. The Vas. Dh. S. quotes numerous verses preceded by the words &ldquo;athāpyudāharanti&rsquo;, which is the case with Baudhāyana also. The word &lsquo;Udāharanti&rsquo; or the words * athāpyudāharanti' occur in Vas. about 42 times. In Chap. 14 alone the words &lsquo;api hyatra Prājāpatyān ślokan-udā haranti&rsquo; occur thrice viz., once before verses 16-19 (of which verses 16 and 18 are the same as Manu IV. 248-49 and are quoted from a Purāna in Āp. Dh. S. I. 6. 19. 13); again before verses 24-27 of which 24 is the same as Manu V. 127 and Baud. Dh. S. I. 5. 56 ); and a third time before Vas. 14. 30–32. The words &ldquo;Mänavam slokamudāharanti' occur four times in Vas. viz. in 3.2 (same as Manu II. 168 ), in Vas. 19. 37 ( which is in Indravajră metre), in Vas. 20. 18 ( same as Manu 11. 151 with slight variations ). In some cases where the word &lsquo;udaharanti&rsquo; is used in Vas. the verse occurs in Vas., Baud. Dh. S. and Manu also. For example, Vas. 1. 2% = Manu ll. 180 = Bard. Dh. S. II, 1.62; Vas. 2.30 = Manu 10. 91 = Baud. Dh. S. II. 1. 52 : Vas. 5. 3 = Manu 9. 3 = Baud. Dh. S. II. 2. 46; Vas. 11. 27-28 = Manu 3. 125-26 = Baud. Dh. S. II. 8. 21-22 ; Vas. 11.25 = Manu 3. 225 = Baud. Dh. II. 8. 14 ( with slight variation). In Ap. Dh. S. II. 6. 13, 6 (the verse apramatta raksatha &amp;c), Baud. Dh. S. II. 2. 36, Vas. 17.9 the same verse occurs preceded by Sudáharanti'. Some verses, though not introduced with the words &lsquo;athāpyudaharanti&rsquo; or with</p>
<p>udáharanti' occur in all three e. g. Vas. 3. 5, 6 and 11 are same as Manu 12. 114, 115 and Manu 2. 157 respectively, and as Baud. Dh. I. 1. 10, 12 and 11 respectively. The same verses are sometimes found in three different sūtra works. For example, Āp. Dh. S. II. 4. 9. 13 = Baud. Dh. S. II. 7.22-23 (both works introduce with &lsquo;athäpyudāharanti&rsquo;) = Vas. 6. 20-21 (without āthāpyu. &amp;o). In many cases Āp. Dh. S, and Vas. have great verbal agreement in their sūtras e. g. compare Ap. I. 4. 12. 8 and Vas. I. 77; Āp. I. 5. 15. 16 with Vas. 23. 33; Ap. 1. 9. 25.1-%, Gautama 23.9. 11 with Vas. 20. 13; Ap. II. 8.17.22 (on &lsquo;panktipāvana) with Vas. 3. 19, Gaut. 15. 28, Manu III. 185. Vas. quotes a verse ( gāthā ) from the Nidāna (work) of the Bhāllavins (a Sámaveda Sākha). 104a Compare Ap. Dh. 8. II. 6. 13. 5 (utpâdayituḥ putra iti Brāhmaṇam ) with Vas. 17. 63 (aniyuktayām-utpanna utpādayituḥ putro bhavati</p>

<p>tyāhuḥ). Vas. has many sutras on several topics very similar in language to Gautama. Compare Vas. XI. 16 and 14 with Gaut. 15. 3 and 5 (on śräddha ); Vas. XI. 49-51, 71-73 with Gaut. I. 6, 12-14; Vas. 17. 42-45 with Gaut. 28. 3-8; Vas. 13 8 ff with Gaut. 16.5 ff (on anadhyāya). Chapters VI-IX of Gautama have many sūtras very similar to Vasistha&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>But the relation between Vas, and the Manusmrti is most important; at least 61 verses of the extant Manusmrti are identical with Vasistha&rsquo;s (except for a word or a letter or tro in a few cases ). Of these some expressly mention the quotation as &ldquo;Mānavam 104b, or “Mānayam ślokam&rsquo; (vide above ), or use the word &lsquo;udāharanti&rsquo; about seventeen times, leaving no doubt as to whether they are quotations. Vas. IV. 5 and XVI. 30 are in prose but use the very words of the Manu smộti viz. Manu 5. 22, 32, 42 and Manu 8. 68 respectively. Some of the verses quoted in Vas, contain the word (Manu) as in IV. 6. There are at least five verses in Vas. three pūdas of which are the same as in the verses of the extant Manu (compare Vas. 3. 59 and M. 5. 123, Vas. 6. 43 and M. 12.109, Vas. 26. 14 and M. 4. 146, Vas. 30.7 and Manu 7. 84 and six passages that contain half verses that are common to Vas. and Manu (Vas. 3. 8 and M. III. 128. Vas. 6. 11 and M. 4. 52, Vas. 8. 8 and M. 3. 103 and Vas. 10.5 and M. 2. 83, Vas. 13. 16 ( Mänava sloka) and Manu 4, 117, Vas. 18. 10 (Pārasayo&hellip; lyāhuh) and M. 9. 178. Several verses occur without these words being prefixed, but most of them seem to be quotations (e. g. Vas. II. 3 which cornbines Manu. II. 169 and 170, IV. 6 which is Manu 5. 41, VI. 6 and 8 which are Manu IV. 157 and 158 ). Some of these verses introduced with the words &lsquo;athāpi&rsquo; &amp;c. as well as some of those not so introduced are in the regular classical Upajāti, Upendravajrā or Indravajrā (vide. I. 38, X. 20 for verses with athāpi &amp;c. and VI. 9 and 25, X, 17, XVI. 36 for verses without them). Some of the verses are in the ancient Tristubh form (e. g. VI. 3 and 30, VIII. 17, XVII. 71). In one verse (VI. 5) there are twelve letters in the first pāda and eleven in the rest. One quotation with words &ldquo;athāpi&rdquo; &amp;c. is in prose ( II. 5). There are a few un-Pāṇinean forms like Vivadanti :</p>

<p>in XIV. 47 (vide Pānini I. 3. 47). It looks as if the dharma sutra once ended with the 24th chapter, where we have an injunction (in gūtra 6 ) against imparting the dharmasūtra to one who is not a son or pupil. The same sūtra occurs in Baudhāyana Dh. S. IV. 4. 9 and the succeeding sūtra is the same in both. But the words' prāyaścitta has been described in the rahasya sections for playing false to the husband' (in Vas. V. 4): apparently refer either to chapters 25-28 (which contain rahasya penances ) or to some prototype of those chapters now lost.</p>
<p>The Vas. Dh. 8. quotes largely from the Rgveda and other Vedic Samhitās. Among the Brāhmaṇas, the Aitareya and Satapatha are frequently cited. The Vājasaneyaka ( Vas. 12. 31 and 23. 13 ) and the Kathaka ( Vas. 12. 24 and 30.5) are menti oned by name. The Tai. Aranyaka is quoted in Vas. 23. 23. The Upanisads and Vedānta occur in 22. 9. Vasistha quotes a gūthū of the Bhallavins from their Nidāna work about the extent of the home of Brahmanismn, which is quoted by Baudhā yana also ( Dh. S. I. 1. 27). He speaks of the argas of the Veda (3.23 and 13.7) and gives their number as six (3.19). Itihasa and Purāna are mentioned in 27. 6. The science of words (grammar), of omens and portents, and of astrology and astronomy (Naksatravidyā ) are referred to in 10. 20-21. He prohibits the learning of the language of the Mlecchas (in 6.41). Vas. quotes a verse that states that the view holding the aprūmūnya of the Vedas leads to perdition (12. 41). In Vas, II. 8-11 occurs the Vidyāsūkta in four verses that we meet with in the Nirukta (II. 4). Vasistha calls his own work dharmaśāstra (in 24. 6) and probably refers to other works on dharma in the words &lsquo;one who studies dharmas&rsquo; (in 3. 19). The study of dharmaśāstra as a penance for even mortal sins is spoken of in 27. 19. Vas. quotes several authors on dharmaśāstra. He quotes à verse from Hārita (in II. 6 ) which occurs in Baudhāyana also with slight variations (Baud. Dh. S. I. 2.7), though without the author&rsquo;s name. The two halves of this verse are almost the same as the latter halves of Manu. 2. 171-172. Bühler is there fore not quite accurate when he says without qualification that the verse attributed to Hārsta occurs in Manu (p. XX, S, B. E. vol. XIV). Vas. quotes Gautama twice (in 4. 35 and 37 about impurity on death, the first corresponding to Gautama fit 41), while there is nothing in Gautama to correspond to the end. Vas. quotes a verse (11, 20 ) which mentions Yama by nemo</p>
<p>FOUNDED</p>
<ol start="9">
<li>Vasiştha Dharmasütra</li>
</ol>
<p>101</p>
<p>and embodies the latter&rsquo;s views. Vas. (18. 13-15 ) quotes three slokas sung by Yama, one of which (14) is the same as Manu 4. 80 and another (15) is very similar to Manu 4. 81. Another sloka of Yama is quoted by Vas. (19.48 ) which is almost the same as Manu 5. 93. From these facts and others Bühler draws the conclusion (S. B. E. vol. XIV, p. XX ) that these verses were taken from the Mānavadharmasūtra, which occupied the same position in Vasiştha&rsquo;s day as the Manusmrti does at present. I demur to this conclusion, which will be discussed later on in detail (under Manusmrti). Vas. (14. 30-32 ) quotes slokas of Prajāpati, the first of which mentions Yama by name 1040, Vas. 14. 16-19 and 24-27 are quoted as slokas of Prajāpati, three of which (14. 16, 18 and 24 ) are practically the same as Manu. 4. 248, 249 and 5.127. Vas. 14. 19 contains a pūda which occurs in Manu 4. 212. It is remarkable that the Vas. Dh. S. cites Vasistha himself with great reverence (as bhagavān) in 2. 50 (about the rate of interest), 24. 5 (about Krochra penance ), 30. 11. In numerous places the Vas. Dh. S. either refers to Manu by naine or quotes the views of Manu (under the form</p>
<p>iti Mānavam') or a sloka of Manu (with words' Mánavam ślokam). All these passages have an important bearing on the age of the Manusmrti and on the supposed existence of a Mänavadharmasūtra. They therefore deserve to be carefully examined. Vas. I. 17 is in prose ( about local, family or caste usages) and summaries the views of Manu. The absence of the word &lsquo;iti&rsquo; before abravin Manuh' and the form of the sūtra itself clearly establish that Vas. is not directly quoting a</p>
<p>104 c Vasistha 14.16-19 and 24-27 are quoted as slokas of Prajāpati. Several</p>
<p>of them arc quoted in different works and ascribed to other sources, For example, Vas, 14.16 and 18 are quoted from a Purana in Ap. Dh. S. I. 6. 19. 13, and these two are practically the same as Manu IV, 248-249 and Visnu Dh. S. 57. 11-12, Vas, 14. 19 is almost the same as Ap. Dh, S. I. 6. 19. 14 and a part of it is Manu IV. 212. Vas. 14. 24 is the same as Manu V. 127, Band. Dh. S. I. 5. 56, Anusāsanaparva 104. 40, Visnu 23. 47,</p>
<p>It may be pointed out that Aparārka (p. 1322 on raj. III. 311) quotes Vas, 28. 10-11 and a prose passage (of 6 lines) in which the Aghamarsana hyon, Rg. X. 189 (dyam gaul dic), Rg.

<p>sūtra of Manu. That sūtra is only a summary of our Manu I. 118. Vas. 3, 2 (which is preceded by the words ' Mānavam slokam' is Manu II. 168. And so are Vas. 13. 16, 20. 18, which are Manu 4. 117 and 11. 151 ( with very slight variations). That the latter existed in Vasistha&rsquo;s text is vouched for by Aparārka (p. 1075). Vas. 4. 5 is in prose and cites the view of Manu that animals may be sacrificed only for worshipping and honouring the manos, deities and guests 105. There is hardly anything to show that it is a direct quotation from Manu and not a summary of Manu&rsquo;s views. The sūtra briefly summaries the views that we find expressed in our Manu 5. 22, 32, 41 and 42 (the words of 42 &lsquo;eşvarthesu pašum himsan&rsquo; are interesting and bear a olose resemblance to &lsquo;paśum himsyād&rsquo; in Vas.). That sutra is followed by a verse which is the same as Manu 5. 41. It is to be noted that the same verse occurs in the dharwasūtra of Visnu (51. 64 ) which reads &lsquo;nänyatreti kathamcana ' for &lsquo;nānyathety bravin Manuh&rsquo;. This change appears to have been purposely made to keep up the impression that the Visnu Dh. S. emanated from Visnu himself and so could not have borrowed from a human author. Vas. 4.7 is very similar to Manu 5. 48. Bühler (8. B. E. Vol. 25, P. XXXI) is wrong in taking Vas. 4. 8 as a quotation from the Mānavadharmasūtra. There is nothing to show that it is so takon. It is more probably a quota tion from or a summary of a Brāhamna passage (compare a quotation in Aparārka on Yāj. 1. 109, which is similar). Vas. 23. 43 ( where Manu is referred to as prescribing an easy penance called Sisukrcchra for children and old men )corresponds more or less with Manu 11. 211 and 219 and Vas. 26. 8 has evidently Manu 11. 260 in view. There are only two places in Vasiştha where the name of Manu occurs for which it is not possible to point out a corresponding verse in the Manusmrti. They are Vas. 12. 16 and 19. 37. The latter is cited as a Mänava sloka and is in the Upajāti metre. 106 Because this is not found in our Manu, Bühler and other Western scholars seem to think 105 pga ataug harada Toj rerni a Ala I ATAS 4.5; 918 4.8 is sponta</p>

<p>that the verse is taken from the Mānavadharmasūtra which onde existed in mixed prose and verse and is now lost. But, as will be shown elsewhere, this hypothesis is based, to say the least, on very slender foundations. Besides these two that are not found in our Manu, there are about forty verses that are common to the Vas. Dh. S. and the Manusmrti and about a dozen verses which, though not strictly identical, are more or less similar. There are several prose sūtras of Vas. which correspond to the verses of Manu almost word for word.107 The hypothesis that commends itself to me is that Vas. contains borrowings from the Manusınști or its purer ancient original in verse.</p>
<p>In the words &lsquo;Srāmanakenāgnimādhāya&rsquo; (Vas. 9. 10 ), the sūtra of Vikhanas seems to be referred to. Gautama (Dh. 8. 3. 26 ) contains the same words. Vasistha&rsquo;s 22nd chap. is the same as Gautama&rsquo;s 19th and Baudhāyana&rsquo;s tenth in the 3rd praśna and seems to have been borrowed from Gautama. Vasistha refers to the views of others in the words &lsquo;eke&rsquo; or &lsquo;anye&rsquo; (Vas. 1. 12, 13, 25 ; 4. 10; 17. 66 ; 20.2). Dr. Jolly (S. B. E, vol. VII, P. XVIII ) thinks that Vag. 28. 10-15 and 18-22 are borrowed from the Vişnudharmasūtra chap. LVI and LXXXVII or its original the Kathakadharmasūtra. Dr. Jolly is not right with regard to both the places. Bühler has already pointed out his mistake as to the second passage (S. B. E. vol. XIV p. XXII). The verses in Vas. 28. 10–15 occur in several smộtis ( vide Sankhasmrti, 10th chap. in Jivananda&rsquo;s ed. part II. pp. 356-357 for the same verses ). Vasistha, chap. 28, verses 1-6 occur in Atrismrti VI. 1-6 (Ānan. collection of Smộtis ) with slight variations of which the first five are quoted as Atri&rsquo;s by the Gșhastharatnākara p. 245 and verse 6 (&lsquo;agnerapatyam&rsquo;occurs in Padmapurāna, Vanaparva 200. 128 (Ch. ed.), Samyarta 1717) and in &lsquo;Gupta Inscriptions&rsquo; No. 81 at p. 296 and in other Inscriptions. Vide H, of Dh. Vol. II. p. 1272, No.5 (in some cases the third pāda of &lsquo;Agner-apatym&rsquo; is different ). Verses 18-22 of Vas. 28 occur in the Atri Smộti VI. 7-11 and in Visnu Dh. S., chap. 87 (last two versos are the same as Vas. 28. 21-22)</p>

<p>and Visnu Dh. S. 90.10 (in prose ) is nearly the same as Vas. 28. 18-19. Besides Vas. 28. 11 occurs in Baud. Dh. S. IV. 3.7. Hence it is hardly proper for any scholar to make the dogmatio assertion that one particular smrti must have borrowed from any other. The rather very corrupt passage in Vasiştha (16.21-23 108) very closely resembles a passage of Sankha, which is cited by Viśvarüpa on Yāj. I, 305 and by the Krtya-kalpataru.</p>
<p>Bühler is of opinion that the home of the school to which the Vas. Dh. S. belonged lay to the north of the Narmadā and the Vindhya (S. B. E. vol. XIV p. XVI). When it is extremely problematical whether the Vas. Dh. S. was the product of a school, it is idle to speculate as to the home of the Vas. Dh. S. Bühler&rsquo;s is no more than a mere conjecture and it is better to admit that we know nothing positive at present on the point.</p>
<p>The earliest work to refer to Vasistha as an authority on dharma is our Manu (8. 140), saying that Vas. allowed 1/80th of the principal as interest per month. This appears to refer to the rule in Vas, 2. 50. We saw above that Vas. borrows from the Manusmrti, which in its turn quotes a rule of Vasistha. The explanation of this is twofold. Both the Manusmộti and Vas. have received later additions and further it is possible that the present Vas. Dh. S. is the work of some one who had received the teachings of Vas, through a succession of teachers and disciples. Yāj. mentions (1.4) Vasistha as a writer on dharma. The Tantravārtika as seen above (note 55 ) remarks that the Vas. Dh. S. was studied by Rgvedins. The same work when speaking of works on dharma puts Manu, Gautama and Vasistha in the forefront. 1084 It appears that Sabara on P. M. S. VI. 1. 10 quotes or summarizes Vas. I.32 and 36 when he says &lsquo;Vikrayospi śrūyate, satamadhiratham duhitrmate dadyāt, ārse gomithunam iti&rsquo;. Vasistha I.32 and 36 are &lsquo;gomithunena carşah tasmad duhitřmatesdhiratham śatam deyam-itiha krayo vijñāyate.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The words &lsquo;tasmad&hellip;deyam&rsquo; do ocour in Ap. Dh. S. II. 6. 13. 11 but not in the definitions of the forms of marriage as in Vas. The words &lsquo;adhiratham satam dubitsmate&rsquo; occur in Sān. Gr. I. 14. 16 and Kausi. Gr. I. 8. 36, but not in connection with any form of marriage (both do not enumerate the forms of marriage ). Višvarūpa, Medhātithi and other early commentators largely quote from Vas. The verse&rsquo;agnerapatyam&rsquo; (Vas. 28.16 ) occurs in the Ragim coppərplate of Tivaradeva of the last quarter of the 8th century (Fleet&rsquo;s Gupta Inscription No. 81.). Therefore the existence of a work of Vasistha on dharma at least in the first centuries of the Christian era is vouched for with certainty and the authenticity of its text is supported by eminent writers from the 7th century downwards. Aparārka quotes passages from the Bhavisyapurāna which have in view the present text of Vas. 109 Some of the views held by Vasistha are very ancient. For example, he speaks of the twelve secondary sons, assigns a very inferior position to the Dattaka son (17th chapter), allows niyoga ( 17. 56 ff) and the remarriage of child widows (17.74 ). Like Āpastamba he mentions only six forms of marriage (1.28-29 ), brāhma, daiva, ārşa, gündharva, kşātra and miinusa. In some respects his views are different from those of early writers like Gautama and Baudhāyana, He prohibits the marriage of a Brāhmaṇa with a sūdra woman (I. 25-26). Vide Baud. Dh. S. I. 8. 2 for the contrary view. He elaborates rules of adoption ( 15th chapter) which are not found in Gaut. or Baud. or Āpastamba. Ho speaks of documents as one of the three means of proof (Vas. 16. 10-15 ), while Gautama, Apa stamba and Baudhāyana are silent on the point, though in Gautama (13. 4) there appears to be a reference to documents. Taking all these things into consideration it may be said that Vasistha is later than Gautama, Āpastamba and Baudhāyana. but much earlier than the beginnings of the Christian era and may tentatively be assigned to the period between 300-100 B. C. It has been asserted by an eminent authority (Cambridge History of India vol. I, p. 249 ) that Vasistha 18. 4 (vaišyena brāhmaṇyām-utpanno Rāmako bhavatityāhuh) probably contains a reference to the Romans. This assumption is gratuitous and does not deserve serious consideration. The reading Romaka (on which the learned writer relies) is not supported by the best mss. and it is most hazardous to seize WiLL</p>

<p>avidity on a variant reading and to build an imposing structure of chronology thereon. The offspring of a Vaiśya male from a Brāhmaṇa woman is designated Rāmaka by Vasistha, while Gautama calls him Krta ( 4. 15 ) and Baud. Dh. 8. (I. 9.7) calls such an offspring Vaidehaka; so Rāmaka has as much to do with the Romans as with Rameses. In the nibandhas there are several quotations ascribed to Vasistha which are not found in the printed Dharmasūtra. For example, Haradatta on Gaut. (22. 18 ) quotes a verse in the Upajāti metre which is not found in the present text 110</p>
<p>The author of the extant Vas. Dh. S. appears to have been eclectic. His sūtra contains dozens of verses that occur in the extant Manusmộti. Similarly, many of the verses quoted by him in the words &lsquo;athāpyudābaranti&rsquo;or the word &lsquo;udāharanti occur also in the Ap. Dh. S. and more often in Baudh. Dh. S. which latter just like Vas. employs the words. athāpyudā haranti&rsquo; over forty times. Towards the end of the present text (edition of Vas., chap. 30. 9-10) occurs the verse &lsquo;yā dustyajā&rsquo; &amp;c., which is found in Vanaparva 2. 36, śānti-parva 174, 55 and 276. 12 and Anušāsana 7. 21. The last sűtra ( of Vasiştha Dh. S.) contains an obeisance to Vasiştha who is described as the son of Mitrāvaruņa from Urvasi and as Satayātu ( who possessed hundred magic spells or against whom a hundred magic speels were employed ). Rg. VII. 33. 11 refers to the birth of Vasiştha from Urvasi and calls him Maiträvarupa and in Rg. VII. 18. 21 we have the half verse &lsquo;Pra ye gshādama madus-tvāyā Parāśaraḥ Satayātur-Vasişthah&rsquo;. Sāyana takes</p>
<p>• Śatayātuh&rsquo; as meant for Sakti, son of Vasistha.</p>
<p>If we rely on the number of verses common to Manu and Vasistha or on rəferences to Mānavam&rsquo; (Vas. IV.5.) or * Mānava-śloka&rsquo; 13. 16, 20. 18 or simply &lsquo;Manu&rsquo; (Vas. I. 17, IV. 6, XI. 23, XII. 16 ) and also consider the very large number of verses and passages common to the Manusmrti, Vas., Baud. and Ap. Dh., it would have to be held that the extant Vas. Dh. 8. is a re-hash of the Ap. Dh. 8., Baud. Dh. 8. and Manu ( as it oxisted before it was remodelled about the beginning of the Christian era or a century or two earlier).</p>

<p>.. It would not be irrelevant, if most of the passages from Vasiştha that are based on or refer to Vedic works are referred to here and examined. First, as to the Rgvedic Literature. Vas. IV. % mentions Purusasūkta (Rg. X. 90), Vas. 17. 3-4 quote portions of Rg. I. 21. 5 and Rg. V. 4. 10 (last pāda, Vas. 17. 16. (praticinam gacchati putratyam ) refers to Rg. I. 124. 7 and Nirukta 3. 5; Vas. 15. 20 refers to making a person bathe with water from a holy lake or stream with the Vedic verses beginning with ' Āpo hi sthā' ( Rg. X. 9. 1 ff); Vas. 17. 1-2 quote from Ait. Br. ( adhyāya 33, 1) and Vas. 17. 31-35 refer to the story of Sunahsepa ( in Ait. Br. 33. 2-6 ). As to the Tai. S., Vas. 5.8 quotes a long passage from Tai. S. II. 5. 1. 1-6 (the transfer of Indra&rsquo;s sin of killing Tvästra Višvarūpa to women); Vas. 11.48 quotes Tai. S. VI. 3. 10. 5 (for the theory of three inherited obligations of brāhmaṇas which is also mentioned in Satapatha Br.) ; Vas. I. 37 quotes Mai. S. I. 10. 11 (anţtam vā eşā karoti yā patyuḥ kritã satyathānyaiš-carati' &amp;c) which also occurs in Kāthaka Sambiti, Sthanaka 36. 5. The Kathaka is mentioned by name twice by Vas. (iu 12. 24 and 30. 5) and the Vājasano yaki (meaning Sat. Br.) is mentioned thrice (Vas. 12. 31, 14. 46 and 23. 13 ); 1104. Vas. 2. 34 quotes Vāj. Saibita (XII. 71 ): Vas. 18. 17 quotes the words &lsquo;nāgnim citvā rāmām upoyåt&rsquo; from the Kathaka and in 18, 18 explains the meaning of Rāmā, which appears to be taken from the Nirukta XII. 13. Among the Brāhmaṇa works the Satapatha Br. is the one that is often quoted; Vas. I. 45 quotes Sat. Br. V. 4.2.3 (&lsquo;brābmano vedam adhyam&rsquo; &amp;o), Vas. 14, 46 refers to Sat. Br. III. 1. 2. 21; Vas. 19. 4 ( vijñāyate brahmapurohitam rāştram-rdhnotiti), which is similar to Gaut. Dh, S. XI. 13-14 and is based on Sat. Br. V. 4. 4. 5; Vas. 30. 3. Agnir-vai brahmana iti śruteh' (this is Śat. Br. I. 4.2.2); ' Vas. 23. 23 mentions the mantra beginning with &lsquo;Agnisoa mā manyusoa &lsquo;from Tai. Ār. X. 24. 1; Vag. XI. 13 quotes Kathopanisad I. 7 ( &lsquo;Vaišvānaraḥ pravišatyatithir brāhmaṇo gļhān&rsquo;).</p>

<p>and its Brāhmaṇas outnumber those from the Rgveda and its Brāhmanas. Then the question naturally arises, why was it adopted by Rgvedins as their Dharmasūtra ( as stated by Kumārila). The answer is obvious. Vasistha is mentioned by name in the Dharmasūtra several times (vide above). The sūtra does rely on the Rgveda and its Brāhmaṇa in a few passages. Vasiştha&rsquo;s is the greatest and most famous name among the ancient sages of the Rgveda. The whole of the 7th mandala contains 104 siktas out of 1028 in the whole of the Rgveda, is ascribed to Vasistha (Maitrāvaruņi). Mandalas I, IX and X have more sūktas than mandala VII, but every one of the three manlalas is held to have been composed by several sages (and not by one for each of them). One aspect of the Vasistha Dh. S. viz. that different mss. of it state that it ends with different adhyāyas is very significant. If it had been from the beginning a sūtra of the Rgveda, then its text would have been at least as well preserved as the text of such gļhya or dharma sūtras, as those of Āśvalāyana and Apa stamba. Besides, there is one remarkable circumstance. The ĀŠv. gr. (II. 6) which is affiliated to the Rg. names and briefly defines eight forms of marriage viz. Brāhma, Daiva, Prājāpatya, Arşa, Gāndharva, Asura, Paišāca and Rākşasa. The Sankhāyana-gļhya (I. 12-14) only describes the religious part of the marriage ceremony and altogether omits the mention of eight forms of marriage and their definitions. So does the Kausitaka-gphya (1. 8). The Gaut. Dh. S. IV. 4-11, Baud. Dh. S. I. 11. 1-9, Manu III 21 and 27-34, Kautilya III, 2. 1-9 name and define the same eight forms of marriage, as Āśv. Gr. does. But Vasistha (I. 28-36 ) mentions and defines only six forms of marriage viz. Brāhma, Daiva, Ārsa, Gāndharva, kşātra and Mūnuşa. In this he seems to follow Ap. Dh. S. II. 5. 11, 17-20-II. 5. 12. 1-2). If Vas. Dh. S. had been from the first affiliated to the Rgveda it should have either treated the subject in the same way as Āśvalāyana or followed the Āśv. gr. and enumerated eight forms or should have been silent about the several forms of marriage (as Sãok. and Kaus. gộ. are ). This circumstance very much strengthens the theory that Vas. Dh. S. is eclestic and therefore followed Ap. Dh. 8. in the number of forms of marriage. There is a further circumstance. Vas. Dh. S. differs from Asv. Gș, not only in the numberly of the forms of marriage but also in the nomenclature. His Klatra. the same as Rākşasa and his Mānusa is the same as Acuta, These two terms were probably borrowed by Vasistha from</p>

<p>Härlta-Dharmasūtra (vide Viramitrodaya, Samskāra prakāša. p. 84). As Manu says (III. 34 ), tho Paisāca form (in which a man has sexual intercourse secretly while the woman is asleep or intoxicated or unconscious, is the worst and most sinful form. Vasistha omitted it and Prājāpatya was probably going out of vogue. Therefore, these two were omitted by Vasistha. The Asura and the Raksasa are declared by Baud. Dh. 8. I 11. 12 to be in accordance with the characterstic conduct of Ksatriyas viz. they rely principally on force either of wealth or of arms (&lsquo;atrāpi şaşthasaptamau Kşātra-dharmānugatau tat-pratya yatvāt-ksatrasya). Therefore, the Rāksasa form which consists mainly of carrying away a girl by force ( Manu 3. 33 prasahy kanyā-haranam ) is called kşātra by Vas. Vasiştha might have been moved by such sentiments as are expressed by Davapāla on Kāzhakagļhya XV &lsquo;prasahyäpahārād-rāksaso vivāhah, tatra kim prakarābhidhānona, evamasaṁvijnātopagamāt Paisacopi prakāravacanam närhati pāpatvāt&rsquo;. Manu ( in 8. 165, 168 declares that all transactions brought about by force or fraud should be held invalid (akrtu). There are also other points on wbich Vas. differs from all three grhyasūtras of the Rgveda or from Sān. Gș. and Kauş. Gị. On even such a simple matter as the age of a Brāhmana boy at Upanayana, Vas, differs from all three. They all agree that the Upanayana of a Brāhmana boy may be performed from the 8th year to the 16th (Vas. XI. 49 and 71, Āśv. Gș. I. 19. 1-2 and 5, San. Gș. II. I. 1, 3 and 6, Kauş. Gr. II. 1. %, 5), they differ on the most commendable year for it. Vas. (XI. 49 ) commends the eighth year from conception, Āśv. the eighth year from birth or conception (I. 19. 1,2), śān. Gr. (II. 1. 1 and 3 ) commends either the 8th year or 10th year from conception and the Kaus. Gr. does the same. So far as I know no other Gr. or Dh. S. gives an option between the 8th or 10th year as the most commendable year for Upa nayana. Gaut. (I. 6, 8 ), Āp. Dh. (I. 1. 19), Baud. Dh. (I. 2.8) Manu (II. 36 ) proscribe as most favoured the 8th year from conception. It follows that Vas. did not agree with any of the three schools of Rgvedins, viz. Ašvalāyana, Sänkhāyana and Kauşitaka and struck an independent course and his work on Dharma was later on affiliated to the Rgveda, when it became a fashion to have a complete set of Kalpasūtras (in three pattet. for each Voda or its recensions.</p>

<p>Dr. Ram Gopal in his work (on pp. 59-60 ) does not agree with my conclusion and, though he has to admit (p. 59 ) that Vasistha Dh. S. is not known to have formed part of a Rgvedio Kalpa, he holds (p. 60 ) on the ground of close agreement of Vas. with the three grhyasūtras of Sān., ĀŠv. and Kaus. on the topics of upunayana, anadhyūrin, snūtake and five Mahūyajñas that Vasiştha&rsquo;s work was from the first affiliated to the Rgveda. In support of his theory he draws attention on p. 67 (note 31 ) to twelve passages from Śãnk. Gr., five from Āśv. Gr. and five from Kauş. Gr. (in all 22 ). I do not want to enter upon a lengthy discussion. If about 75 passages quoted from Manu and numerous passages quoted with &lsquo;udāharanti,&rsquo; the presence of chapters on adoption, vyavahāra, inheritance, partition, räjadharma and prayascittas, which are not shown to have been included in a Vedic Kalpa of the Rgveda do not induce a writer to admit the independent origin of Vas. there is no use in arguing with him. It is, however, necessary to show clearly what value should be attached to his arguments. His contention briefly put is that the 22 passages he cites from San. Aśv. and Kauş. gphya very closely agree with Vas. Dh. passages and therefore Vas. must be held to be affiliated to the Rgveda from the beginning. He cites Vas. IV. 6 as equal to $ab. G. S. II. 16.1 (viz. the verse &lsquo;madhuparke ca etc.). But this verse is Manu V. 41 and both Vas. and Sān, might have borrowed it from Manu (and what is most important Manu&rsquo;s name occurs in the verse itself). Dr. Ram Gopal cites Vas.VI.:21 (āhitāgniranad vāmśca &amp;c ) as equal to Sān. II. 16. 5. Therefore he concludes that Vas. is indebted to śān. It is very fine research indeed. There are two verses Astau grăsă&rsquo; &amp;c. and &lsquo;āhitāgairanadväsinca &amp;c&rsquo;in Vas. VI. 20-21. Both of these are cited in Baud. Dh. 8. II. 7. 22-23 and Āp. Dh. S. II. 4. 9. 13 (in both those verses occur with the caption athāpyudāharanti&rsquo;). It is noteworthy that the Kalpataru ( Brahmacārikānda p. 124 )cites &lsquo;aparimitam brahmacāriņah (part of the verse &lsquo;aştau grāsā&rsquo;) and the verse Canadvän brahmacãri ca āhitāgniśca &amp;c as from Vasistha, Āpastamba, Hārita and Yama. San. Gr. II. 16 cites on a one of these two verses and that too in a modified form (as Anadian agnihotram ca&rsquo; (this is a bad reading and the verso lecomes ungrammatical). Therefore, this proves that Sån. gr burrans</p>

<p>one of two ancient verses quoted by both Āp. and Baud. and Vas. borrows both. Sān. Gr. II. 16 has six verses, of which the first (&lsquo;madhuparke&rsquo; &amp;c ) is Manu V. 41 (reads &lsquo;yajñe&rsquo; for &lsquo;some&rsquo;). The 3rd verse ( Naikagrāmina &amp;c&rsquo;) is Manu III. 103 (the 4th pūda in šān, is different which is rather obscure in Manu). Sān. Gr. II. 16. 5 has been dealt with above. 1100 Upākarma is a very common rite even up to this day. So the provisions in the texts on this rite agree. Dr. Ram Gopal cites Vas. 13. 5 as agreeing with Sān. Gs. IV. 6.7-8. There is not much verbal agreement between the two as the note will show 110c but there is at least as much or more verbal agreement with Gaut. and Manu. A thorough examination of all the twenty-two equations in Dr. Ram Gopal&rsquo;s work (p. 67) would cover about a dozen pages. The domestio rites and their subsidiary matters being common to dvijas, there is a good deal of uniforinity as well as some difference in details in the sūtras connected with different Vedio Sākhas. For example, compare Baud. Dh. 8. I. 2. 14-16 with Āp. Db. S. I. 2. 33-38, also with Gaut. I. 15-23. Mere agreement of a few sūtras with others on simple and common matters relating to Upanayana, Anadhyāya and the like hardly proves anything about their affiliation with any particular Veda or Vedic carand. I regret to say that Dr. Ram&rsquo;s remarks on the passages of Vas. and the three Gș. sūtras attached to the Rgveda ara misleading and also incapable of proving his thesis.</p>
<p>So early a writer as Visvarūpa cites (on Yāj. I. 19 ) the views of a writer called VỊddha-Vasistha. The Mit. on YÂj. (II. 91 ) quotes the definition of a jayapatra (judgment) from: Viddha-Vasistha and on III, 20 quotes him about impurity on miscarriage. On Yaj. III. 310 the Mit. quotes Vasistha 27.4 and then in the very next verse quotes a long passage from Vğddhavasistha in prose and verse setting forth an expiation. The same passage occurs also in Aparārka on the same verse. Aparārka quotes in all 18 verses (two of which define the form and contents of a Jayapatra of a court of justice ) and one</p>

In Dánakanda (p. 189) it quotes two verses on &lsquo;gocarma&rsquo; and the reward of gifts of land of the extent of gocarma from VỊddhavasistha 1104. The Smộticandrika quotes about 20 verses from Vrddha.Vasistha on āhnika and śrāddha ; Bhattoji in his gloss on the Caturvimśatimata (p. 12 ) seems to quote a prose passage from Vệddha-Vasistha. From the above it follows that. Vņddha-Vasistha was an early compilation and dealt with almost all such topics (including Vyavahāra ) as are dealt with by Yāj. The Mit, also quotus on Yaj. III 287 a Brhad Vasiştha. The Smộticandrikā (III. p. 300 ) quotes a few verses from a Jyotir-Vasistha. The I.

<li>Visnudharmasutra. The Vişnudharmasūtra has been printed several times in India, viz. by Jivananda in his Dharmasastrasangraha (1876 part I pp. 70-176 ) by the Bengal Asiatic Society (1881, ed. by Dr. Jolly with extracts from the commentary Vaijayanti ), by M. N. Dutt (Dharmaśāstra texts, vol. II pp. 541-666, Calcutta, 1909) and translated by Dr. Jolly (in the S. B. E. vol. VII with an Introduction). In the present work Dr. Jolly&rsquo;s edition has been used. The gūtra contāins one hundred chapters. Though the number of chapters is so large, the sūtra is not very extensive. There are several chapters such as 40, 42 and 76 that contain only one sūtra and one verse. The first chapter and the last two are entirely in verse; the remaining chapters are in mixed prose and verse, the versified portion being generally at the end of each chapter. As pointed out by the Vaijayanti the sūtra is in close relation to one of the oldest schools of the Yajurveda, viz. Katha. It also stands in a peculiar relation to the extant Manusmộti.

<p>Odrāyaniya are two of the twelve sub-divisions of Caraka sākhă of the Yajurveda. Dr. Jolly ( S. B. E. VII, p. XII ) gays that the Visnudharmasutra has four chapters (21, 67, 73 and 86 ) and that both drew from a common source. Bühler points out( West apd Bühler&rsquo;s digest, 3rd ed. p. 35 ) that the Kathakagļhya found in Kashmir agrees closely with the Dharmasūtra of Visnu and the mantras in the latter agree with the Kāthaka recension of the Yajurveda. But the Visun. dharmasútra is not the work of the same author that com posed the Kathaka Srauta or Grhya sūtras, nor does it appear that it formed part of the Kathaka Kalpa. Dr. Jolly ( R. u. S. p. 7 ) says that Govindarājā ( 12th century ) in his Smrti mañjarī cites a passage in prose from a Kathasūtrakrt on the penance for Brāhmana murder which is wanting is our Visņusmrti ( vide S. B. E. Vol. 25, p. xxl n for the passage ).</p>

<p>The Visuudharma-sūtra somewhat resembles the Dharma sūtra of Vasistha. Like the latter it is full of verses. But one feature which is peculiar to the Visnu-dharmasūtra is that it professes to be a revelation by the Supreme Being. None of the other dharmasútras so far described assumes this role. The style of the Vişnudharmasūtra is easy and somewhat diffuse. It presents hardly any ungrammatical forms. The printed text is corrupt only in a few cases ; the verses occur generally at the end of chapters. Sometimes the number of verses in a chapter is very large e. g., in chapter 20 there are 21 sūtras and 32 verses, in chapter 23 there are 24 verses, in chap. 43 there are 14, in chap. 51 there are 20 verses. Some of the verses are in the classical Indravajrā (19. 23-24 ) and the Upajăti metres ( 23.61 and 59. 30 ) and a few are Tristubhs (29. 9-10, 30. 47, 72. 77). The three Tristubhs ( 29. 9-10, 30. 41 ) are three out of four verses of the Vidyā Bükta occurring in the Nirukta (II. 4). Chap. 72.77 is Bhagavadgitā 11. 70. Chapters 1, 99, 100 are entirely in verse. Chap). 98 contains praise of Väsudeva by the Earth in about 91 names, some of which like Lekhya, Sapta, Kapila. Sankhyācārya are rather surprising. The revelation by God Visnu is contained in 96 chapters (2 to 97 ). The nares of Visuu are only 94 bat 98.6 ( on nainas-te ) and 98.101 (namo nama iti ) are added to 94 and thus the names of Vişnu are squared up with 96 chapters. The word uthu does not occur at the beginning of the first two chapters and in Dr. Jolly&rsquo;s edition at the beginning of some other chapters also ( viz. 4, 16-20, 22-23, 26-27, 29-32 &amp;c.). The chapters vary greatly in extent. In Chap. 34, 39 and 40 there is only one sūtra followed by one verse. There are other chapters bolso that are short, that is they have three or four sūtras andma. verso vix. 41, 84, 88, 89, while some chapters occupy mort</p>

<p>than three printed pages such as 3, 20, 22, 23, 51, 54, 96. Chap. 5th is the longest, containing 178 sūtras and 14 verses at the end. Here and there Visnu Dh. S. gives etymologies such as of the word putrue in 15. 44 ( = Manu 9. 138 ), of Māmsa ( in 51.78 = Mapu V.55 ), of purusa ( from puri sete ) in 97.15, which is also given in Br. Up. II. 4.18 and Nir. I. 13), At the end of Chap. 78 there are two gathās (52-53) sung by pitrs which are quoted by Kullūka on Manu III. 274 as Vişnu&rsquo;s and which are similar to Manu III. 273-74 and Vāyu-puräna 82.11 and Matsya-purana 204.5 ( matsya Chap. 204 has Gāthās 3-17 sung by the pitrs, 10 of which begin with api syāt sa kulessmäkam etc. ). Vide Anušāsane parva 88. 12-17 (Ch. ed.). There is one verge ( 72.6 ) which has eleven letters in the first püüda and twelve in the remaining three,</p>
<p>In determining the age of the Visnudharmasūtra one is confronted with a difficult problem. Some of the chapters undoubtedly contain material which is comparatively old and on a level with the ancient Dharmusñtras of Gautama and Apastamba. Such are the chapters about rājadharma and punishments (3 and 5), the rules about twelve sons and the mixed custes ( 15-16 , funeral rites and mourning (21 and 22 ). But there are very large portions of the work that bear a clear impress of a later date. The Visnudharma. sūtra apd the Manusinrti have at least 160 identical verses. But this is not all. There are hundreds of sūtras which are merely the prose equivalents of verses from the Mapusinrti. For example, Vişnu 2.3 and Manu 2.16, Vinnu 3.4 and 6 and</p>
<p>an 7. 69 70, Vionu 3, 7-10 and Manu 7. 115, Visnu 3. -15 and Manu 7. 116-117, Visnu 4.1-13 and Manu 8, 132-137, Visnu 5. 4-7, and Manu 9. 237, Vişnu 20. 1-21, and Manu I. 67-73, Visyu 51. 7-10 and Manu 4. 209-212, Visuu 59. 21-25 and Manu 3. 70, Vinnu 62. 224 and Manu 2. 59, Visnu 71. 48-52 and Manu 4. 80, and Visnu 96. 14-17 and Manu 6. 46 agree almost word for word. The verses that are identical in both are found in all the chapters of the Manusmrti from the second to the last, the largest number ( about 47 ) occurring in the 5th and chapters eleven, two, and three respectively contributing 25, 24, and 19 verses</p>
<p>Therefore the question whether the extant Vişnudharmasutra borrows from Mavu or vice versu or whether both borrow Hom the common original assumes very great importance, As thorax</p>

<p>respondence extends over several hundred verses of the Manu smộti, the last hypothesis of borrowing from a compion original does not recommend itself to me. No such common source is known to have existed and to say that there were hundreds of floating popular verses whose authorship was unknown and which were drawn upon by both works appears to me to be au extremely gratuitous and unsatisfactory assumption. In my opinion it is the extant Vinnudharmasūtra that borrowed the verses ac hoc or adapted them from the Manusmrti, There are several lines of reasoniug that strengthen this hypothesis. There are some verses that are identical in both, in which the name of Manu occurs, which the Vismudharmasūtra omits by making slight verbal changes. For example, Vişnu 23. 50 substitutes&rsquo;tat parikīrtitam&rsquo; for &lsquo;Manur-abravit&rsquo; in Manu 7. 131 ; and Visņu 51. 64 reads &lsquo;nünyatreti kuthamcaua&rsquo; for Manu 5. 41&rsquo;nünyatretyabravin-Manuḥ&rsquo; ( this last occurs in</p>
<p>Vas. 4. 6). The reason for these changes is obvious. The Vişnu-dharmasūtra professes to be a direct revelation from Visuu and it is in keeping with this assumed role tbat not one human author is mentioned by name in the sutra. Therefore where the nume of Manu occurred in any verse, it was pur. posely omitted. Another reason why the sūtrit must be presumed to be the borrower is the character of the extant work itself. It is a kind of hotchpotch and contains verses that are identical with those of other works. For example, several verses of the Bhagavadyità occur in the Vishudharma sūtra. Visnu 20. 48-49 and 51-52 are the same as Gītā 2. 13; 23, 24, 28 ; Visnu 72. 7 and Gită 2-70 are almost identical. Visnu 96. 97 and the first half of 93 are the same as Gītā 13. 1-2, except that in keeping with its character of a revelation to the Earth, the Vishudharmasūtra substitutes &lsquo;vasudhe for&rsquo; kaunteya&rsquo; and · bhāvipi &lsquo;for bhārata.&rsquo; Several verses of the Yájšavalkya-smrti are identical with those of the Visuudharmasūtra. For example, Vistu 6. 41 and Yáj, 2. 53, Visnu 8. 38 and Yāj. II. 79, Visņu 9. 33 and Yāj. 2. 97, Visnu 17. 17 and Yāj. 2. 138, Vişnu 17. 23 ( first half) and Yāj, 2, 210 ( latter half ), Visnu 62. 9 and Yūj. 1. 21, Vi. 63. 51 and Yāj. 1. 117 are identical. Besides these, there are hundreds of prose sūtras that are identical with passages of Yājñavalkya. For example, Vi. 3. 72-74 = Yüj. II. 1-4; Vi. 3. 82=YASI 318-320 ( rules about land grants.); Vi. 5. 65-69=Ya n. 217-220, Vi. 5. 73=Yāj. II. 221; Vi. 45. 3-12 =Yāj. 3. 2002141 ( about diseases suffered by singers ); Vi, 60.24 = YĂj.</p>

Dr. Jolly thinks that Yājñvalkya borrows from Visnu the whole of the anatomical section ( vide S. B. E. vol. VII, p. XX ). With great respect I differ from this opinion. There is nothing to show that the anatomical details were first given to the world by Vişņu. They must have first been embodied in works on medicine such as those of Caraka and Susrutall and were probably copied by Dharmasūtra writers. But, if there is any borrowing between Visņu and Yājñavalkya, I think from the character of the Visnudharmasūtra that it is the sūtra that must be regarded as borrowing from Yājñavalkya. There are Beveral matters in the extant Visnudbarmasútra which are wanting in Yājñavalkya and which induce one to place the extant sūtra later than Yājšavalkya, viz. the uame .Jaiva' for Thursday ( Vi. 78. 5 ), the long list of tirthas ( Vi. chap. 85 ) which include Sriparvata and the five rivers of the south called southern Paîcanada, the importance of the conjunction of the moon and Jupiter on a full moon day (Vi. 49. 9.10 ), the vague definition of Aryavarta 1a ( Vi. 84. 4). The verse in Vişnu 54, 33 ( about half prayascitta for boys and old men ) is ascribed to Angiras by the Mitākṣarā (op Yáj. III. 243 ).</p>
<p>Therefore, the most probable conclusion is that the extant Visnudharmasutra burrows from the Manusmrti, Yajnavalkya and other authors. It would be too much to assume that tbe Manusmrti, the Bhagavadgitā aud Yájšavalkya borrow from such a comparatively unimportant work as the Vishudharma sutra.</p>
<p>The above conclusion is further strengthened by certain other considerations. The Manusmrti has been quoted with utmost reverence by a host of writers from at least the 4th cen tury downwards, such as Sabara, Kumärila and Sankarācirya.</p>

<p>Yajñavakya was commented upon by Visvarūpa in the first half of the 9th century. Visvarūpa in his com mentary quotes scores of sūtras from Gautama, Apastamba, Baudhāyana, Vasistha, Sarkha and Hārīta. But it is significant that Visvarūpa in his commentary on Yajña valkya does not quote even a single gūtra of Visnu by name. It is true that Visvarupa ( on Yaj. III. 66 ) says that the four forms of asceticism ( pārivrājya ) should be under stood from the other smrtis like those of Visnu. 113 This probably refers to chap. 97 of the extant Visnudharmasūtra. Medhatithi (on Manu 3. 248) quotes Visnu (21. 12 ) and on Manu 9. 76 quotes a sūtra of Visnu which I could not trace in the printed Visnu. 114 The Mitākṣarā mentions Visnu about thirty times. The quotations are taken from chapters 19, 21, 22, 35-42, 50, 51, 52, 75 and 79 of the Visnudharma sútra, 18 sūtras of chap. 22 ( on āśauca and kindred topics ) being quoted on Yāj. III. 23, 24, 27, 29-30. But it is a remarkable fact that not one of the verses in the extant Vişnudharmasūtra is cited as Visnu&rsquo;s in the Mitāksarā. The only exception is a verse cited as Visnu&rsquo;s on Yaj. III, 265, which has the same purport as Visnu 52. 14 (a verse) and the first pūdu of which is identical with that of the verse in the Visnudharmasūtra 116 A few verses that are quoted as Vişnu&rsquo;s in the Mitāksarā could not be traced in the extant dharmasūtra.16 It is not unlikely that the sūtra</p>

<p>Quotations from the Visuudharmasūtra in the Krtya. kalpataru (no part of which had been published at the time this volume was published in 1930, but now eleven parts of which have been published in the GOS. edited by my friend the late Prof. Rangaswami Aiyangar) are made hundreds of times e. g. 132 times on Vyavahārakānda, 39 times on Srāddha, 38 times in Niyatakāla, 35 times in Gșhasthakānda, 30 times in Brahmacárikānda, 10 times on Rajadharma, 15 times ou Dánakānda ( the Dānakinda quotes on pp. 231-33 the whole of chap. 90 except the last five sūtras and a verse). One great advantage is that the Kalpataru often states that the same verse or passage occurs in Visnu and other ancient writers e. g. in Vyavahărakānda on pp. 270, 613, 627, 652, 676, 678 &amp;c. verses are cited as Manu-Visnu and cited as Visnu and Yājñavalkya on pp. 150, 213, 289. Yāj. II. 120 ( second half ) is Visnu 17. 23 (first half ). The whole of Visnu Chap. 49 ( on Dvadasivrata ) and Vismu Chap. 89 are quoted by Vratakānda of Kalpataru on pp. 310, 418 respectively. Among later writers of nibandhas Apararka quotes Visnu most profusely and the Smrticandrikā also quotes Visna about 225 times. Many of the verses found in Vi. are quoted by Aparărka as Vinnu&rsquo;s e. g. Vi. 84. 4 on Yāj. 1. 2; 68. 46 47 on Yāj. 1, 106 ; 67. 33 on Yáj. 1. 107; 5. 183 on Yáj. 2. 60 ; 10. 9-11 on Yáj. 2. 102. But there are numerous verses quoted as Visnu&rsquo;s by Apararka which are not found in the sutra, e. g. on Yāj. I. 21, 53, 89, 100. Sometimes. Aparărka quotes almost whole chapters of Visuu, e. g. Vi. 68 on Yaj. I. 106 and 90 on Yāj. I. 208, 70 on Yäj. 1. 114. It is to be noted that Vi. 70. 17 (a verse) is quoted by Aparárku as a prose sutra (on 1. 114 ) with slight verbal changes. All these facts make one feel naturally sceptial about the anthenticity of most of the verses in the extant Visnudharmasútra. They probably formed no part of the sutra at the time when the Mitākṣarā</p>

<p>was composed. At all events it cannot be gainsaid that the verses are a very late part of the sūtra.</p>
<p>The Visuudhamasūtra contains quotations from all the Vedic sarhitās and from the Aitareya-brāhmana (as in Vi. 15.45 ). It mentions the Vedängas very frequently (30.3 and 38, 28. 35, 83. 6 ), it speaks of Vyakarana (83,7 ), of itihäsa ( 3. 70, 30, 38, 83. 7), of Dharmaśāstras (3. 70, 30. 38, 73. 16, 83. 8), of Purūna ( 3. 70, 30. 38 &amp;c ). About the close correspondence between Baud. III, 6 and Visnu. 48 and between Vas. 28. 10-15 and 18-22 and Visuu, chap. 56 and 87, vide remarks made above pp. 43 and 103. The sutra quotes several verses ( called gūthūs ) and says they were sung by pitřs; vide 78. 52-53, 80. 14, 83. 21, 85. 65-67. They bear close resemblance to the găthās sung by the pitřs quoted in the Apušāsana-parva 88. 11-15 and a half verse estavya bahavaḥ putra yadyekopi Gayām vrajet&rsquo; is the same in Vi. 85. 67 and Anu. 88. 14. The Vinnusmrti enumerates twenty one hells ( 43. 1-22 ), which are almost the same as Yājña valkya&rsquo;s (3.222-224 ). It mentions the names of the seven days of the week (78. 1-7-), Thursday being called Jaiva, while Yājñavalkya mentions only the seven planets (with Rābu and Ketu ) in the same order ( I. 296 ). It recommends the practice of sutī ( 25. 14 ), speaks of pustakas (18, 44, 23. 56 ), a word which is not used by the other dharmasutras 80 far described. It gives a long list of good and evil omeus at the time of startivg on a journey (63. 33-39 ). Among evil omens it includes the sight of yellow-robed ascetics (i. e. Buddhists probably ) and Kāpålikas ( 63. 36 ). It prohibits speech with Mlecchas, Antyajas ( 71. 59 ) and journeys to Mleccha countries ( 84. 2 ). It contains special directions about the worship of Vāsudeva in chap. 49 and speaks of Svetadvipa as the reward of devotion to Vásudeva ( 49. 4). Here and there, there are eulogies of Vasudeva ( 1. 50-57, 65. 1, 97, 10, 98 which ( last ) gives one hundred names of Visųu ). It speaks of the four vyūhas of Vásudeva ( 67.2 ) and of the Varāhā incarnation. It gives a vague location of Aryāvarta us a country where the four varnas exist ( 84. 4 ). It enumerates numerous sacred places ( 85. 1-52 ), among which Sriparvata, Saptársa ( modern Satayo Godāvari and southern Pancanada deserve to be spabadiy noted. Though it does not specifically enumerate the eighboro122</p>
<p>History of Dharmaśāstra</p>
<p>titles of law just as Yājňavalkya does not, yet it contains rules ( in chapters 5-6 ) on almost all of them.</p>
<p>As Yājiavalkya enumerates Visņu among the pro pounders of dharmaśāstras, it follows that a work of Visuu existed in comparatively early times. What matters that work embraced it is difficult to say. It probably contained the topics found in the works of Gautama, Apastamba and others. It may have included portions borrowed from the</p>
<p>Kathakagrhya.</p>
<p>An important question is whether the Visnudharmasutra is related to the Kathaka school ( of the Caraka sākhā of the Kranayajurveda ). I do not propose to deal with it at great length. Nanda Pandita in his Com. on Visnu Dh. S. 67.3 (where twelve deities are named) expressly states that the deg cription of Vaisvadeva in that chapter follows the procedure adopted in the Kāthakaśākhã &lsquo;Kāthaka-śnk hānusārena Vaisvadevam-āha &hellip;&hellip; Agnyādibhyo dvādaśālutirjuhuyāt&rsquo;. Important evidence is furnished by the Krtyakalpataru, an extensive digest composed in the first half of the 12th century A. D. on Sriddha (GOS. Ed.). Vishu Dh. S. chap. 73 provides about āmašrāddhas (śrāddhas with uncooked grains) and Kamyusrāddhas ( srāddhas performed on certain tithis, naksatras and weekdays for securing certain desired objects specified in Visnu Dh. S. Chap. 78) a certain procedure (the original is quoted in the note ) 1186 &lsquo;in these srāddhas</p>

The Kștyakalpataru on Sräddha (pp. 164-65 ) sets out Visnu Db. S. 73. 5-14 and remarks that the words&rsquo; first pancaka&rsquo; &amp;c. have in view, according to Laugāksiyrhya, the Anuvāka of 15 rks, where the first pañcaka begins with the rk&rsquo;iyam-eva' (which is the first of the pentad ), the second pentad begins with pañca vyustih' and the 3rd pentad begins with &lsquo;ftasya dbāma&rsquo;. Thene fifteen verses form the 10th unuvāka of 39th Sthānaka (called' yadakranda' from first two words ) of the Kathaka sambită. The first verses of the pentad of this anuvāka in Kāthaka-samhită is ' Iyameva să &amp;c. &lsquo;, the first verse of the 2nd pentad is&rsquo; punca-vyustir-anu' and the first verse of the third pancaka is &lsquo;?tasya dhama&rsquo;. The above makes it clear that the Visnudharmasūtra took the Kāthaka-samhita and the Kathaka-grhya (or Laugākşi ) as its basis. The words</p>
<p>prathama-paūcakena, madhyamapancakena' are vague and could have been understood only by those who know their relation to Kåthakgrhya and Kätha kasambiti. It follows that at least some chapters (like 21, 64, 65, 67, 78 Svc.) were certainly based on the Kūķhaka grbya (if not all ). and the Visuu Dh. S. was originally intended to be a Dharma sūtra for the students of the Kathaka, though in course of time it grew and included elements not connected with Käthaka-sūkhă. 1160</p>

<p>It may be stated that on Visnu Dh. S. 21. 17 also Nanda paudita mentions the Kāthakgrhya, that Visnu Dh. S. 64. 21 (Drupadăm Sãvitrīm vā) refers to Kāthaka S. 38. 63 (Drupa dādivonmumucānah etc. ). Similarly, Vişnu 65. 2 (Asvinoh prānastau te iti jivudānam dattva) mentions Kathaka-sam. 11. 17; on Vi. Dh. S. 65. 7 Nandapandita remarks that the four mantras (Kāthaka-saṁ. 36. 29-32) are to be recited; Visnu 65. 11 (tejosi sukramiti dipam ) mentions a mantra from Kāthaka-sam. I. 33.</p>
<p>Dr. Jolly in his learned and long introduction to the translation of Visuu Dh. S. (SBE. Vol. VII, pp. IX-XXXVII) deals with several problems, some of which have been discussed already. His remarks on some problems will be briefly mentioned here. On p. XXIV (in order to establishi the priority of Vişņu to the Manusmrti ) he says that the</p>
<p>· Visnusūtra nowhere refers to South Indian nations such as the Dravidas and Andhras or to the Yavanas'. That non mention does not lead to positive conclusions is well illus. trated here. The Andhras are mentioned even in the Aitareya Brāhmana ( 33. 6), where Viśvūmitra curses his dis: obedient sons that their offspring will be Audbras, Sabaras and Pundras' &amp;c, ). Asoka in his 13th Rock edict mentions Andhras. On p. XXI Dr. Jolly refers to Yāj. II. 240-41 where nūnaka is mentioned and punishment is provided for one turning out a false nanaka or for fabricating a royal grant, wbile Visnu V. I refers only to royal grants but not to nānakas. This is put forward by Dr. Jolly as a ground for regarding Vishu as more ancient than Yāj. (p. XXI). It has been shown that the Vishudharmasutra professes to be a direct revelation by God Vişņu to the Earth Goddess and therefore the redactor of Visnu knowing that the Dāyaka is of foreign origin omitted that word. Lastly, his view ( Intro. pp. XXV, 1f), following the lead of Bühler, that the extunt Manusmrti is an improved metrical edition of the Mănava-dharmasūtra (not now available ) will be dealt with later under section 13 ( Mänavadharmasútra: did it exist ?). I agree with Dr. Jolly that some devotee of Viņņu recast the original Dharmasútra ( Intro. pp. XXVIII ff). I am in agreement with the view which Dr. Jolly holds that the original Visuudharmasūtra was closely connected with the Kathaka Samhită. Not only Nanda pandita, but the Krtya kalpataru ( of the first half of 12th century ) relies on the tradition that Vişņu Dh. S. accorda with Laugākşi-głby</p>

<p>Dr. Jolly (on pp. XXIX-XXXI of his Introduction) puts forward several considerations as to how and why the chapters were raised to 100, what portions may be regarded 28 old and what were added by the Vişnuite redactor later. I do not agree with everything he says but on the whole his treatment is judicious. He observes that the Vişnuite editor (pp. XXXII ) cannot be placed earlier than 3rd or 4th century A. D. I agree with this.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The original Vinnu Dh, S. ( mostly in prose ) may have to be placed about 300 B. C. to 100 A. D. and the present inflated text about 400 to 600 A. D. Vide two papers of Prof. L. Renou of Paris on Visnu in Journal Asiatique ( 1961) pp. 163-172 ( in French ) and in Bulletin of the D. C. R. I. Vol. 20 parts 1-4 ( in English ) pp. 319-323.</p>
<p>When Dr. Jolly ways that certain chapters of Vişņu Agree closely with the Käthakagrhya, all that is meant is that some of the sutras of Visnu are the same or almost the same as those of the Kathakayshya (e. g. compare Visuu 21, 73 and 86 with Käthakagshya V. 12, V. 9, and V. 3 respectively ). But in all these places Vinnu contains more details than the Kathakagrhya. It may, however, be noted that in a few cases tbe views of the Kathakagshya differ from those of Visnu. For example, Vişnu ( 30.1) speaks of Vedic studies for 44 months only in the year when once they are started on the full-moon day of Srāvana or Bhadrapada, while the Kāțhakagrhya ( I. 9. 10), gives three alternatives, viz. 442, 5 or 543 months ; Visņu prescribes that the proper year for the upanayana of a ksatriya is the 11th from conception ( 27.10 ), while the Käthaka prescribes the 9th, without specifying whether it is to be from conception or birth (IV. 1.2); Vişnu enumerates eight forms of inarriage ( 24. 18), while the Kūţhaka (II. 3 and 4 ) speaks of only two, Brāhma and Asura, and is silent about the rest: Visnin ( 46. 19-20 ) defines Sānta pana and Mahü sauta pana differently from the Kūthaka (1. 7. 3-4), but agrees with Yājña valkya (III. 315-816 ). Here the recent Lahore edition of the Kūthakagļhya by Dr. Caland has been used. As it used Kathaka mantras and borrowed from the Kāțbakagļhya, the dharmasūtra may have been ext. book of the Kāțbaka school and probably originated in Kashmir and Punjab which is the home of the Kath.</p>
<p>12B</p>
<p>History of Dharmaśāstro</p>
<p>The date of the older portion of Vinnu may be placed between 300 B. C. to 100 B. C. But this is no more than a mere conjecture. It is to be noted that Kumärila does not mention the Visnudharmasūtra among the sūtras studied by particular schools. Then several centuries later on the whole of the sūtra was recast from the Vaisnavite point of view and received large additions both in prose and verse. When these additions were made we have no exact means of determining. It is probable that they were not made very long before Visvarūpa. At all events the additions were made long after the Yājňavalkyasmrti and after the 3rd century. The mention of the week days makes the sūtra comparatively a late work. The earliest epigraphic mention of a week-day is in the Eran inscriptiou of 484 A. D. ( vide Fleet&rsquo;s Gupta inscriptious pp. 88-89 ) and Varahamihira (6th century ) knew the week days well. The Brahmapurana (28. 55) mentions Sunday and the Padmapurīna mentions Thursday ( Brahmakhanda chap. 11. 34 ). The Sürya-siddhanta (XII. 6 and 78 ) speaks of the lords of days. Thus ulthough the extant Vişnu&ndash;dharmasutra is a late recast, it contains a few doctrines that were held in ancient times. For example, it allows a Brahmana to marry a girl of anyone of the four varnas ( 24. 1 ) and does not inveigh against niyoga as Manu does.</p>
<p>A few of the sútras agree closely with Närada. Vide Vi. 7. 10-11 and Närada ( Ruādāta verses 136-137 ).</p>
<p>The Mitākşarī quotes all the prose passages of chapters 85-42 and ascribes them to Bșhadvisnu (on Yaj. 3. 242 ). Similarly, on Yaj. 3. 261 it ascribes Vi. 35. 3-5 to Brhad. visuu. Similarly, the Smộticandrikā (II. p. 298 ) ascribes Vi. 17. 4 ff to BỊhad-Vişnu. The Mitāksarā (on Yāj. 3. 267 ) quotes a verse of Vrddha-Vişnu which summarises some sutras of Viņņu&rdquo;? (50.6 and 12-14).</p>
<p>In the Anandāśrama collection of smytis there is a Laghu-Vinnusmặti in five chapters and 114 verses dealing with the duties of the varras and the four asramas. Aparārka in his commentary on Yāj. 3. 238 quotes four</p>

<p>verses from Laghu-Vişnu, which are not found in the Anandásrama text. So Aparārka used some other work or perhaps a larger work. The Parāsara-Müdhaviya often quotes gadya-Visnu and padya-Visņu. The former from a quotation in vol. I. part 2, p. 234 seems to be the Visņu dharma sutra itself. In the Sarasvativilāsa numerous sūtras of Visnu with the explanations of Bharuci thereon are quoted, which are not found in the printed Vişnu.118</p>
<p>The Visnu-dharmasūtra was commented upon by Nanda pandita, author of several works on dharmaśāstra, who wrote at Benares the commentary called Vaijayanti (accord ing to certain m8s.) in 1679 (i. e. 1622-23 A. D.) of the Vikrama era. Dr. Jolly publishes extracts from this commen tary in his edition of the sutra.</p>
<p>From the fact that the Sarasvativilisa quotes several times the sutras of Visnu with Bhāruci&rsquo;s explanation, it looks probable that Bharuci commented upon the Visnudharma sutra. For further information on Bharuci vide sec. 61.</p>
<p>So far only the printer and well-known Jharmasūtras have been passed under review. But there were numerous other dharmasūtras which are either noir extant in rare m88. or are not yet discovered but are only to be reconstructed from quotations. It is now time to discuss them.</p>

<p>Harita&rsquo;s view is quoted by Baud. Dh. S. II. 1. 50, which differs from the view propounded in Baud. Dh. S. II. 1. 49; Ap. Dh. S. refers to Hārita in I. 13. 11, I. 18. 2, I. 19. 12, I. 28 1, 5 and 16, I. 29. 12 (which is the same as quoted in Baud. Dh. S. II. 1. 49 ). Vasistha quotes Harita in II. 6 ( a verse the first half of which is in Manu 2. -71 and the 2nd balf in Manu II, 172 and in Vapaparva 180. 35). Vide also Baud. Dh. S. I. 2. 7 ( whieb is almost the same verse as in Vas. II. 6 and seems to be a quotation as &lsquo;iti&rsquo; is added at the end. Apagtamba quotes Harita more frequently than any other author. From this it may be concluded that they belonged to the same Veda. The Tantravārtika (vide note 55 above) mentions Härita along with Gautama and other sūtrakāras on dharma. From Visvarüpa down to the latest writers on dharmaśāstra Hārita is most profusely quoted. From the quotations it appears that his dharmasūtra was perhaps the most extensive of all dharmasútras.</p>
<p>Dr. S. C. Banerjee contributed to the Journal of Oriental Institute&rsquo; Baroda Vol. VIII, No. 1 (1958) pp. 14-37 &amp; reconstruction of Harita-dharmasútra and in his recent publication on Dharmasūtras' devotes pp. 257-289 to prose passages alone from Hārīta quoted in several nibandhas on all topics of Dharmaśāstra arranged in Sankrit alphabeti cal order but transliterated in English characters. In pp. 239-244 he mentions twentyfour authors as writers of Dharmasūtras with brief notes on each and in pp. 244-344 he sets out transliterated prose sutras from these 24 writers and omits passages from Sankha-likhita because I collected passages from them in ABORI. Vol. VII-VIII ( vide p. 84 above) and onnits Bșhaspati also since the late Prof. Ranga swami Aiyangar extracted passages of Bịhaspati quoted in nibandhas, arranged them under different topics and publish ed them in the G. O.S., Baroda (1941 ).</p>
<p>The late Pandit Vamansastri Islampurkar discovered at Nasik a ms. of the Harita-dharmasitra. It was not possible for me to make use of it for the present work. Dr. Jolly (in R. und S. pp. 8-9) gives an account of the mg. from which I give a summary. It is so faulty that an edition based on it alone cannot be thought of. The ms. contains thirty chapters.

<p>procedure and the law of crimes &amp;c. are not found in the m8. The prose is mixed up with verses in Anustubh and Tristubh metres, which are often introduced with the characteristic words &ldquo;athāpyudāharanti&rdquo; as in other dharmasūtras. The m8. quotes &lsquo;bhagavān Maitrāyani&rsquo; and the verse &quot; Satadāyo viro” which is Maitriyaniya Samhită 1. 7. 5. Dr. Caland points out remarkable correspondence between the citations of Hārīta and the Maitrāyaniya Parisista and Mänava. Sraddhakalpa. All this tends to show that he was a sütra kāra of the Black Yajurveda. The numerous quotaticns from Hārīta in Apastamba and Bandhāyana are not, however, found in the ms. The ms. was found at Nasik, which is also the source of two mss. of the Maitrāyaniya Samhitā. The Kashmirian word kaphella' is cited in Harita and 80 the Härita-dharmasútra probably originated there. Hemādri ( Caturvarga III. 1. p. 559 ) mentions a commentator (bhășyakára 118 ) of Hārīta.</p>
<p>From the numerous quotations from Hārita in the nibandhas it appears that the dharmasütra dealt exhaus. tively with the same topics as are dealt with in other dharma sūtras, viz. sources of dharma, brahmacárin of two kinds ( upakurvāna and naisthika ), anataka, the householder, the forest hermit, prohibitions about food, impurity on birth and death, śråddha, the parktipāvana, geueral rules of con duct, the five yajñas, Vedic study and holidays, duties of kings, rules of statecraft, court procedure, the various titles of law, duties of husband and wife, various kinds of sins, prāyascittas, expiatory prayers &amp;c.</p>
<p>According to Kullūka (on Manu 2. 1) the Hărita-dharma sutra opened with the words &lsquo;now then we shall explain dharma; dharma is based upon revealed texts ( fruti); revealed texts are of two kinds, the Vedic and the Tântric&rsquo;.126</p>

<p>History of Dharmasastra</p>
<p>Sruti is of two kinds viz. Vaidiki (consisting of the Veda ) and Tāntriki (consisting of Tantra )&rsquo;. I did not explain this last word. Now I realise that the word is liable to be misunderstood. A veteran scholar like Dr. R. C. Hazra went so far as to suggest (in I. H. Q. Vol. 36 pp. 141-150 ) that by Tântriki' I meant the system of Tantras (developed several centuries later than the Dharmasūtras ) dealing with Mantras, secret practices and esoteric teachings of gurus and that Hārita did not know the tautras that were &amp; later development altogether. I agree that the Haritadharmasutra did not use the word Tāntriki in the sense in which the word</p>
<p>Tantra is used in much later times. But as the text of Harita was not available, I could not dilate on that point and did not state what he must have meant by Tântriki sruti.</p>
<p>I was then concerned only with the contents of the Hārītadharmasūtra available from quotations in late works on Dharmaśāstra. Härita gave a wider meaning to Sruti than what other ancient sūtras and smrtis give to the word. In Gaut. Dh. S. I. 1-2 it is stated that the Veda is the source of dharma and also the smộtis and usages of those who know the Veda. Manu (II. 6) says the same thing and in 11. 10 asserts that Sruti means Veda and Smrti means Dharma sāstra. Härita as quoted by Kullūka widens the meaning of Sruti, as including Veda and also something more. But as that point has been now raised I shall try to explain briefly what he probably meant by Tāntriki (Sruti). The word Tantra is a Vedic one. It occurs in æg. X. 71. 9 ( siris-tantram tanvate aprajajñayaḥ). Tantra here appears to mean &lsquo;loom&rsquo; and the word is derived from the root &lsquo;tan&rsquo; to spread or stretch. Pāṇini in VII. 2. 9 derives the word from the root &lsquo;tan&rsquo; with affix &lsquo;tra&rsquo; and in another sūtra (V. 2. 70 ) states that &lsquo;tantraka&rsquo; means cloth recently taken off from a loom. The Amara kosa gives four meanings of tantra', one of which is &lsquo;siddhānta&rsquo; (a system of thought or philosophy ). Hărita&rsquo;s idea appears to have been that a work dealing with the formulation of principles based on the Veda ( and hence called</p>
<p>• Tântriki' from the word tantra meaning siddhanta ) might be designated Sruti. It would be clear from the Nyāyasūtra ( I. 1. 27-31 ) that Sānkhya and Yoga may be called &lsquo;samda tantra&rsquo; though they differ on certain points. Similarly the Arthasāstra may be called Samāna-tantra with the Manak smrti, es both have certain principles in common, though</p>
<p>FOUNDEA 7</p>
<ol start="11">
<li>The Dharmasútra of Harita</li>
</ol>
<p>131</p>
<p>they differ in other matters. It may be noted in this conneo tion that the word &lsquo;tantra&rsquo; is applied to the Sārkhya system by Sānkarācārya (in his blāsya on Vedāntasūtra II. 2. 1) and the Purvamimamsă system is styled by him as prathama tantra' in his bhāsya on Vedānta-sūtra III. 3. 53. The Sāňkhya-kārikā refers to itself as &lsquo;tantra&rsquo; in Kärikā 70 &lsquo;tena ca bahudhä kệtam tantram&rsquo;. Bșhaspati as quoted by A parārka p. 740 says that a wife is called half of a man in Amnāya' (Veda ) and Smrtitantra'. So Hārīta Dharma. sutra understands the word &lsquo;tantra&rsquo; as meaning a bästra based on Veda'. The Arthasāstra of Kautilya sets out in the 15th adhikaranu &lsquo;tantra-yuktis&rsquo;. Vide for further details on the meaning oftantra’H. of Dh. Vol. V. pp. 1031-3.</p>
<p>The quotations show that this style ( as in n. 120 ) was pursued in the body of the work. Aparārka (on Yāj. III. 322) quotes a sūtralal in a similar style about a penance Tulā puruşa' said to have been promulgated by Siva himself. Härita-sūtra often introduces verses as quotations with the words &ldquo;an author says thus&rdquo; (evam hyāha ; vide Aparūrka on Yāj. I. 83, I. 154, 1II. 135, Vivāda-ratnākară pp. 443, 626 ). Numerous passages quoted as Hārita&rsquo;s are identical with passages from other dharmaśāstra works. The sutra &lsquo;Jāyā patyor-na vibhāgo vidyate&rsquo; is quoted as from Härīta by the Smrticandrikā (II. p. 268 ), which is the same as Ap. Dh. S. II. 6. 14. 16. The same work quotes &lsquo;pratyakşavidhānād gärhasthyasya&rsquo; as from Hārita which is part of Gautama. 3. 35. A verse about the enormity of usury quoted in the Smsticandrikä (1. p. 177 ) as Hārīta&rsquo;s is almost the same as Baudhāyana ( I. 5. 79 ) and Vasiştha( 2. 42). A verse about atipātakins (quoted by Aparārka on Yāj. III. 231 ) is the game as Vishu 34. 2. Manu is mentioned by name in several verses (vide Smộticandrikā III. p. 436, Vivāda-ratnākare p. 552-553). Two verses are cited in the Vyavahāratattve of Ragbunandana as found in Hārīta, Baudhāyana (I. 10. 30 ) and Manu (8. 18-19). A verse quoted by the Smşticandrika ( II. p. 21 ) is almost the same as Manu 8. 95. Several times</p>

<p>we have the words ' Prajāpativaco yathā' (vide A parārka on Yāj. I. 154 and Smộticandrikā I. p. 181 ). Hārīta seems to have relied upon the views of&rsquo;ācāryas ’in several places. 138 He often quotes the views of others (eke, apare 124 ) and sometimes refutes them.125</p>
<p>Mārīta refers to the Vedas, the Argas, dharmasastra, metaphysics, and other branches of knowledge. 136 The quota. tions do not show that he belonged to any particular Veda, as be quotes from all the Vedas promiscuously. In this con nection it is worthy of note that, though Kumārila mentions Hårita as an ancient dharmasūtrakāra, he does not assign him to any particular school, while he assigns Apastamba and Baudhāyana to the Taittiriya school.</p>
<p>Some of the doctrines of Hārīta are worth noting. He speaks of eight forms of marriage, but two of them are styled Kşatra and Mānuşa, while Arşa and Prājāpatya are omitted ( vide Viramitrodaya, Saṁskāraprakāśa, p. 84). Vasistha has the same nomenclature ( I. 29). Härita speaks of two sorts of women ( bruhmavādinīs and sadyovadhū8 ) and states that the former were entitled to bave the Upanayana performed, to keep the sacred fire and to study the Vedas.127</p>

<p>He speaks of the twelve kiuds of sops ( vide Haradatta on Gautama 28. 32). He looks down upon the profession of an actor and forbids the employment of a Brāhmana actor in any śrāddha or rite for gods.128 A Hārītabhāsyakāra is mention ed by the Kalpataru ( śrāddha ) on p. 51 in explaining a prose passage. Apararka (on Yaj. II. 332 ) quotes from Hārita a lengthy passage in mixed prose and verse, where the worship of Ganesa comes in.128</p>
<p>A very interesting question is the relatiou of the verse quotations from Harita with the prose quotations from Harita The dharmasūtra was probably interspersed with verses as is the case more or less with all dharmasūtras except that of Gautama. But there are numerous verses ascribed to Harita in the nibandhus, which are manifestly modern. Both the Mitākşarī and Aparārka (on Yāj. I. 86 ) quote Hārīta&rsquo;s verses eulogisivg the satī. The Smrticandrikā ( III. p. 344 ) quotes his verses that refer to the signs of the Zodiac. There are numerous verses coutaining elaborate rules of procedure, ascribed to Hūrīta, which are quite foreigo to the general atmosphere of the ancient dharmasūtras. All such verses must be escribed to a comparatively later date. In the Suddhima yükha it is said that certain verses quoted from the Mahābhārata by Härita are not found in several copies of the Mahābhārata.</p>
<p>The Dharmasūtra of Hārīta appears to have been a very extensive one and was iu mixed prose and verse. Aparārk&amp; quotes both prose and verse passages over 110 times, one remarkable matter being that the quotations on Vyavahāra are only a few (both iu verse and prose ). The Kalpataru contains a very large number of prose and verse quotations from Hărita. It would be a great service if some scholar collected all the quotations ( prose and verse ) cited in the Kalpataru with notes. They are profuse and some are very interesting. In the Brahmacărikānda he is quoted over .50 times and there are very large prose passages on pp. 198, 268, 271, 277 (on three kinds of spātakas ). The</p>

<p>Vyavahāra-K. profusely quotes both prose and verses over 70 times. Some pruse passages are very long e. g. on pp. 623-625 on the proper acts for a wife ( Atha patnyācărān anukramişyāmah gặham patni &amp;c. ). Even in Srāddha section there are many huge prose passages on pr. 66-67, 88 (long list of panktidūsakas ), 163, 204.</p>
<p>Dr. Jolly ( in 1889) collected most of the prose and verse citations from Härita on the Vyavahāra section. In Jive nanda&rsquo;s collection, we have i Laghu-Hārita-smrti (I pp. 177-193 ) and a Vrddha-Härītasmști (I. pp. 194-409 ). The former contains seven adhyāyas and about 250 verses, dealing with the duties of the four varņus and the āśramas and with Yoga. The latter is professedly a Vaisnavite work, said to have been proclaimed by Hārīta to Ambarisa; it is divided into eight chapters and contains about 2600 verses, dealing with the nityu and nuinittiku rites of the vurnus and asramas, the nature of the individual and Supreme Self and the means of attaining hvokş%. In the Anandasrama collec tion of smrtis, Vrddha-Hárita is divided into eleven chapters, the first two of Jivananda&rsquo;s being split up into five. The Anandāśrama collection contains a Laghu-Hārita-smrti in 117 verses, which is different from the Laghu-Hārita of Jiva nända. The former deals with purification from pollutions of various kinds, with prāyaścittas, rules about impurity on birth and death, śräddba and a few rules about inheritance, pártition. &amp;c. 129a</p>
<p>It is noteworthy that Aparárka (on Yāj. III. 254 ) quotes Vņddha-Hārita and Hārīta, both in prose, one immediately after the other. Vrudha-Hīrīta in prose is cited by the Mit. on Yāj. III. 259, 261. Some comparatively early com mentators and digest-writers started the theory that authors</p>

<p>That the Vrddha-Hirita in verse is comparatively a late work follows from the fact that it distinctly recites that the smrtis of Manu, Yājñavalkya, Nārada and Kātyāyana were known to it as authorities on raja-dharma.130 Some of the quotations ascribed to Laghu-Hārīta in Aparärka and other works are found in the Laghu-Harita, e. g. the verse —vina yajiiopavitena ' (Laghu-Hirita, Anandisrama, verse 23 ) is quoted by Aparārka on Yij. III. 289. Some verses that are ascribed to Hārīta are found in the Laghu-Hārīta; for example, the verge &lsquo;snānam kṛtvā tu ye,&rsquo; cited by the Smrticandrika (I. p. 203), occurs in the Laghu-Harita ( Anandāšraina, verse 41 ). It appears that several compila tions were made at different times, embracing different topics of dharma and ascribed to Hārīta, probably because they were based more or less on the Hārītadharmasútra.</p>
<p>That some of the verses ascribed to Hārita are very anci ent follows from several considerations. For example, Visva rūpa quotes (on Yāj. III. 246 ) a verse from Hārīta. The</p>

<p>Sarasvativilāsa quotes from Harita a brief passage which appears to be a portion of a verse and Katyayana&rsquo;s explana tion thereon.131 It follows that long before the sixth century A. D. Hārīta&rsquo;s Dh. S. contained verses.</p>
<p>For Hārita on Vyavahāra, vide sec. below.</p>
<p>Dr. S. C. Banerjee in J. O. I. ( Baroda ) vol. VIII pp. 14-37 ( 1958 ) published a collection of passages of Hārita dharina-sutra ( transliterated ) from 21 works ( holding the different parts of the Smộticandrikā as separate works ), but without any translation or notes.</p>
<p>If all passages of Hārīta quoted in the several nibandhas were collected and carefully studied it would be found that several verses are common to it and Manu and other smộti kāras. For example, Kalpataru (op Grhastha ) p. 43, noted that the verse Vrsalīphenapītasya' is common to Manu, Yama and Hūrīta (it is Manu IV. 19). The same kända on p. 310 quotes with the word (&lsquo;evam hyāha&rsquo;) three verses one of which ( pañca paśvanyte hanti) is the same as Manu VIII. 98.</p>

<p>him to go to the king Sudyumna for punishment. Likhits went to the king who would not punish him as he was a man of pure character and learned ; wheu he persisted the king ordered his hands to be cut off. His arms were restored when he plunged into the river Bāhudã. In Santi ( 130.29 ) 132a it is said It is not possible to live if one adopts Sankhalikhita mode of life, particularly when one intends to secure the pro tection of the subjects.' In another place (Santiparvan 132. 15-16 ) it is said &lsquo;Some hold that conduct or practice is the best characteristic of dharma, others to whom Sankha-Likbita are dear do not like them.&rsquo; Vide Sabhāparva 7. 11 where among the holy sages who graced Iudra&rsquo;s sabhii are included Saijkha and Likhita.</p>
<p>In the Pāli Dighanikāya II. 40-41 we have the words &ldquo;Sakhalikhita - brahmacariyam caritum'. Prof. Bapat in the Silver Jubilee Vol. of BORI. ( 1942 pp. 61-66 ) tries hard to prove that the words Nayidam sukaram agāramajjhi vasatā ekāntaparipumpam ekäntaparisuddham Sankha likhitam-brahmacariyam caritum' occurring in the Dighani. kāya (2nd sutta, 40-41 ) have nothing to do with the Dharmasūtrakāras. The word &lsquo;brahmacariyam&rsquo; does not mean in Pali books the life of a Vedic student, but only a pure moral life here (that was to be led by a student in brahmanical society ). But the words quoted from the Digha are just like the words quoted by me above from the Mahābharata (Santi 130. 29 ). My own idea is ( whatever the date of Sakha-likhita as writers may be ) that the Pali story is based on the story in the Mahābhārata. It is not unlikely that the two had led or emphasized an excellent moral life. Thereafter, the redactors of the Mahābhārata included them in a story in the Santiparva and the Pali</p>

<p>writers included the gist of that story in their works. Just as it is difficult to assign a definite date to the Mahābhārata, so also it is impossible or at least as difficult to say (there being no reliable evidence) that all the Nikāyas existed in writing before Asoka. Yājňavalkya ( I. 5) mentions Sankha Likhita among the writers on dharmaśāstra. The Parāsara smrti says (I. 24 ) that in the four ages of Kệta, Tretā, Dväpara and Kali, the ordinances of Manu, Gautama, Sarkha-Likhita and Parāśara are respectively of paramount authurity in matters of dharma. Visvarūpa (on Yāj. III. 248 ) quotes a verse from an ancient author which says that Sankha and Likhita pondered deeply over the dharma promulgated to the sages by Manu and drew upon the Veda188 also. From the gist of the passages of Sarkha Likbita quoted by Viśvarūpa and the words ‘Pratijñātārtha virodhah syāt' it appears to have been the view of Visvarūpa that the verse quoted was the first verse (or one of several verses at the beginning) of the sūtra of Sarkha-Likhita. The word Manu-bhāsitam&rsquo;in note 133 was either introduced by some redactor at a later date or the word does not refer to the extant Mapu, but to some earlier version of it. Commenta tors and nibandhakaras from Visvarūpa downwards profusely quote Sarkha-Likhita. A considerable portion of these quota tions is in prose. Hence it is quite clear that the dharma sūtra of Sankha&ndash;Likhita is an ancient one, that it was largely if not entirely in prose and that it was once easily accessible though it has not yet been discovered. In the Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute (vol. VII-VIII) I made an attempt at a reconstruction of Sanka-Likhita.</p>
<p>Jivananda (collection of smrtis, part II, pp. 343-374 ) prints in 18 chapters and about 330 verses a smrti of Sankha and a smrti of Likhita in about 93 verses ( part II., pp. 375– 382 ). The Anandāśrama collection also prints the same text of the two smrtis. The latter also contains a Laghu-Sarkha smrti in 71 verses and a Sarkha-Likhita-smrti in 32 verses. All these, except perhaps the Sankha-smrti in 18 chapters, are late compilations. The smrti in 18 chapters seems to have been compiled very early. About fifty verses from it are quo</p>

<p>ted by the Mitāksarī. In the 11th and 12th chapters occur a few prose passages, one of which is quoted even by Medha tithi. The numerous prose quotations ascribed to Sankha Likhita do not however occur in these smộtis. One point deserves special notice. Comparatively early writers some times ascribe the same text to Sankha-Likhita or to Sankha simply. The well-known sūtra about succession to a son less man ( athāputrasya svaryātasya bhrātrgāmi dravyam &amp;c. ) is ascribed to Sankha by Viśvarūpa and the Mịtākṣarā, but to Sankha-Likhita by Aparārka (on YĀj. II. 135-136 ). Similarly, the sūtra &lsquo;pitaryasakte kutumbavyavahārān jyes thaḥ &lsquo;&amp;c. is ascribed to Saikha by Aparārka and to Sankha Likhita by the Vivāda-ratnākara, Dāyatattva and Madana parijata. Quotations ascribed to Likhita are few and far bet ween. Some passages are ascribed by some writers to Sankha and by others to Likhita. For example, a prose passage</p>
<p>Uddhrtya pariksitābhiḥ&rsquo; &amp;c. is ascribed to Likhita by Apa rårka ( on Yāj. I. 18 ) and to Sankha by Visvarūpa (on Yáj. I. 20 . and by the Viramitrodaya ( Āhnika prakāśa p. 68). Similarly, the sutra &lsquo;ubhábhyamapi hastābhyām prānmukho devatirthena kuryāt&rsquo; is ascribed to Sankha&ndash;Likhita- by the Pārāśaramadhaviya : I. 1. p. 352 ) and to Likhita by A parārka (on Yāj. I. 101). The relation of the Sankha-smrti in verse to the dharmasūtra of Sankha seems to be this. The former is based upon the latter and is a versified paraphrase or adaptation of portions of the dharmasútra. 134</p>
<p>The versified Sarkha shows a tendency towards greater strictness. The dhormusūtra allows a Brāhmana to marry a woman of any of the four castes, while the verse Sankha resti icts him to the first three custes. 136 It is not unlikely that the dharmasūtra contained a few verses as is the case with Baudhāyana, Apastamba and Vasiştha.

<p>writer as Visvarūpa looked upon the prose and verse portions as the composition of the same author (vide his comment on Yāj. III 237, and Aparārka pp. 1149, 1154, 1161 ).</p>
<p>The dharmasutra of Sankha-Likbita was commented upon early. Laksmidhara in his Kalpataru (Ghose&rsquo;s Hindu Law vol. II. p. 504 ) draws attention to the fact that the bhāsya kāra of Sarkha read a well-known sūtra as &lsquo;sa yadyekaḥ syat&rsquo; instead of &lsquo;sa yadyekaputraḥ syāt. ' Vide Kalpataru ( vyavahārakānda ) p. 654 (sa yadyekaputraḥ syāt ) and f. n. 6. Lakşmidhara flourished between 1100-1160 A. D. as he was a minister of Govindacandra of Kanauj. The Vivāda ratnākara ( 1314 A. D.) also cites the bhâsyakära of Sankha&hellip; Likbita. The Vivādacintīmaņi (p. 67 ) quotes from the bbaşyakāra of Sarkha-Likhita.</p>
<p>The dharnasūtra of Sankha-Likhita would appear, from the quotations in the nibundhus, to have closely resembled the other extant sūtras on dharma in style and contents. It embraced almost all the topics treated of in Gautama or Apastamba. It agrees very closely with the words of Gau tama and Baudbāyana in several places.138 It is curious to note that a quotation from Sankha containing the names of writers of smrtis cites Sarkha-Likhita as authority. 137</p>
<p>The dharmasūtra seems to have permitted niyoga, speaks of twelve secondary sons, and did not favour (like Apastamba ) the claims of females to succeed to males. On certain points the dharmasūtra of Sarkha marks a more advanced state of opinion than is the case with Gautama or Apastamba. Sarkha speaks of several kinds of ordeals and appears to have contained elaborate prose rules about thern (vide Aparārka on Yāj. II, 95; Smộticandrikā II, p. 112, Viramitrodaya, p. 270).

<li>The Dharnasūtra of Sarkha-Likhita 141 Sakha-Likhita gives more detailed information than Apastamba or Baudhāyana. The limits of Aryävarta188 stretched over wide areas according to Sankha (i. e. to the east of Sindhu-Sauvīra and to the west of Kāmpilya ) than is the case with Baudhāyana ( I. 1. 25 ) or Vasistha ( I. 8-9). The style of Sarkha reminds one of Kautilya rather than of Gautama. The quotations hardly exhibit any upgrammatical forms. It is noteworthy that Yājñavalkya is included among the authors of smitis by Sarkha ( vide note 137 ). If it is the extant Yajnavalkya-smrti that is meant to be referred to, then the dharmasutra of Sankha will have to be assigned to u late date. But this does not seem to be likely. From the fact that the Yājõuvalkya-smrti itself enumerates Sankha Likhita anong ancient authors on dharna, from the general style of the work, from the development of the legal concep tions it presents and from its doctrines about the rights of women, it appears almost certain that the extant Yājña vulkya-smrti is much later than the dharmasūtra of Sankhu. There are close correspondences between Sarkha and Yājfia valkyu.138 Saikha is quoted 99 times and Sajjkha-Likhita 63 times by Apararka. Ou Yüj. 111. 289-90 (p. 1154 ) Apa rārka first quotes Sarkha as &lsquo;Agnyutgādi samvatsarum Cāndrāyaṇam cared-gam ca dadyat&rsquo; and five lines after wards quotes Saikha-likhita with the words &lsquo;Agnyutsādi mithyādhiti ca sarivatsarain bräbmanagrhesu bhaiksyam caretām&rsquo;. Kalpataru (Brahmacári) quotes Sankha-Likhita 36 times, and Sarkha 19 times. From the fact that Sankha Likhita is quoted as including Sankha-Likhita among writers on Dbarmaśāstras it may be inferred that the original text was tampered with by some redactor. Kalpataru on Vyavahára (pp. 830-31 ) cites a long prose passage of Sankha-Likhita on the proper avocations of the men of eleven mixed castes viz.</li>

<p>The prose quotations from Sankha-Likhita refer to the Vedāngas, Sänkhya, Yoga, Dharmaśāstra. Sankha recogni sed eight forms of marriage. The views of Sankha about the status of the offspring of mixed marriages differed from those of Baudhāyana (1. 8. 6 ) and Manu (X. 6) and were inter mediate between the latter two.140 The tarparu141 ( which resembles the one in Baudhayana, though it is more elaborate) refers to the six Vedāngas, Bhārata ( but not Mahā-bhārata ), to twenty writers on dharma and contains numerous details about geography, mythology, and cosmogony which are gene rally found in the Purānas. The dharmasutra frequently cites the opinions of others. It mentious by name the views of Prajāpati, Angirasa and Usanas ( Vivådaratnākara p. 537 ), Prācetasa (Vivādarat. p. 557-560 ), VỊddha-Gautama ( Mada na-pārijāta pp. 701-2). The verse quotations ascribed to Sankha further mention Yama, Kátyáyava and Sankha him self. But in drawing chronological conclusions it is better to leave the verse quotations out of account. The saine verses are ascribed to Manu and Sankha242 and a few sūtras closely resemble the Manusinfti.143 Six identical verses occur in the Vasistha-dharmasūtra (21. 10-15) and in the Sankha smrti ( 10th chap. ).</p>
<p>All these circumstances lead to the conclusion that the dharmasútra of Sankha is probably later than Gautama and Apastamba but earlier than the Yājňavalkya-smrti and 80 must be assigned to some date between 300 B.C. to 100 A. D.</p>

<li>Mānavadharmasutra-Did it exist ? Following the orthodox view of Western Sanskrit scho lars that most of the dharinasūtras are older than almost all, if not all, the metrical smrtis, I gave the first place of honour to the dharmasutras of Gautama and others. But my own views differ to a great exteut from those of the orthodox school of Sanskritists represented by Max Müller and Bübler. It is high time to state here my views about the existence of a Mänava-dharma-sūtra supposed to be the original of our extant Manu.</li>
</ol>
<p>Some western scholars, particularly Max Müller and Weber, started the ingenious theory that the extant Manu. smrti was a recast or remodelling of an ancient Mänavadhar masūtra. Max Müller went so far as to enunciate the bold generalisation “There can be no doubt, however, that all the genuine dharma-sástras which we possess now, are without any exception, nothing but more modern texts of earlier sūtra works on kuladharmas belonging originally to certain Vedic caranas&rdquo; (H. A. S. L. pp. 134-135). For this sweeping gene ralisation there were very few data when it was made, as is admitted by Bihler. This theory of Max Müller was as hasty, as unfounded and as uncritical as several other theo. ries of his such as that about the renaissance of Sanskrit Lite rature in the early centuries of the Christian era, about the absence of the art of writing in India before Pānini and about the uniform employment of the sloka for literary purposes in his so-called sūtra period and earlier. Western Scholars had to give up such theories before the stern logic of facts, but they have tenaciously clung to the theory about the Manu smrti being a recast of the Mänavadharmasūtra. One of the main planks of Max Müller&rsquo;s edifice was the now exploded theory about the non-employment of the anustubh during the sūtra period ( which he tentatively placed between 600 B. C.-200 B. C. ) for continuous composition. In spite of the fact that one of the main planks has totally collapsed Bühler makes strenuous efforts to rehabilitate Max Müller&rsquo;s theory by additional a priori arguments (S. B. E. vol. 25, PPA XVIII-XXIII and xxxI-XXXIX). The main points brought forward by Bühler are:-(I) The Vasistha Dh. S. (IV. 5 contains four sūtras, the first of which is The Mänava sayan that one may kill an animal only in honouring the Mones, gode</p>
<p>144</p>
<p>History of Dharmasastra</p>
<p>and guests'. There follow two verses and a passage in prose with iti at the end. Buhler argues that all the four sûtras are quotations and as the extant Manusmrti is in verse, they must be regarded as taken from the Mänavadharma sūtra. (II) There are other quotations in Vasintha attributed to Manu which either contradict the present Manusmrti or have no counterpart in the latter. Bühler draws special attention to the fact that Vasistha (19, 37) quotes &amp; Mänava Sloka which is not in the anustubh metre and which has nothing corresponding to it in the extant Manusmrti. (III) A fragment of Uganas quotes an opinion of Manu about impurity, which is in prose.144 Bübler himself points out that here one ins. reads &lsquo;Sumantuḥ&rsquo; for &lsquo;Manuh&rsquo;. Therefore, this argument is of very little use in establi shing the existence of a Mänavadharmasūtra. Besides, it is possible that the mutilated passage is not a quotation at all, but a mere summary of Manu&rsquo;s views. There is no &lsquo;iti&rsquo; at the end to show that it is a quotation. (IV) Kāmanda kiya.nītisāra (II. 3) says that according to the Mānavas the villyas to be studied by a king are three, viz. the three Vedas, Vārtā, and Dandaniti and that what is called Anviksiki is but a branch of trayī; while the Manusmrti ( 7. 43 ) appear to reyard the four as distinct vidyas,148 Kimandaka (XI. 67 ) says that Manu prescribed that the council of ministers should consist of twelve ;146 while Manu (7. 54 ) says that the * 8ucivas' should be seven or eight. Biihler therefore argues that Kimandaka has in mind the Minavadharmasūtra and</p>

<p>not the Manusmrti and on the word &lsquo;Mānavah&rsquo; makes the following observations &lsquo;It is a very common practice of Indian authors to refer in this manner to the books restricted to special schools. But I know of no case where the doctrines of the Mānavadharmaśāstra or of any other work, which is destined for all Aryans and acknowledged as authoritative by all, are cited in the same or similar way&rsquo; (S. B. E. vol. 25, p. XXXVIII). In the first place it has to be noted that Kūman daka is only paraphrasing the words of Kautilya in the above two places.147 Further, it is noteworthy that Kāmandaka employs the word &lsquo;Manuh&rsquo; while Kautilya uses the word</p>
<p>Mānavāḥ&rsquo; (about the number of ministers). Therefore, acco rding to the Kāmandakiyanītisāra there was no difference between the two. viz. the words &ldquo;Manuli' and &lsquo;Māna väh&rsquo; denoted the same thing, a work. What Bühler means by his emphasis on the word &ldquo;Mānaväh' is not quite clear. Early writers like Kumārila and Visvarūpa employ the word &lsquo;Mäna vam&rsquo; with reference to the Manusmrti just as they use the word Våsigtham to denote the Vüsisthadharmasūtra (vide Tantra-vārtika pp. 167, 194 and Visvarūpa on Yāj. III. 245 and 257). Sankara in his bhāsya on Br. Upanisad I. 4. 17 applies the word . Mänava' to the Manusmrti Mānave ca sarvā pravrttih kūmahetukyeveti' ( referring to Manu 11. 4). Besides, there is hardly any conflict between the views of the Mánavas and the Manusmrti on the point of the number of the vidyās. The Mänavas knew that Anviksiki was counted as a fourth vidyā but said that it was really comprehended in the study of the Vedas. The Manusmști only lays down from whom the vidyās were to be learnt. As regards the number of ministers, we cannot afford to forget that the Manusmrti (7.60 ) allows more ministers than seven or eight. Another explanation also is possible. In the final remodelling of the Manusmrti from its original in verse it is not unlikely that a few changes were made. (V) On the strength of the preser vation of the complete set of the sūtra works of Apastamba on srauta, grbya and dharma (also of Baudhāyana and Hira ụyakesin ), it is urged that the Mānava carana had a sūtia on dharma.

<p>History of Dhurmusāstra</p>
<p>and the Mānava-grlyasūtra (edited by Dr. Knauer in 1897 and recently in the Gaikwad Oriental Series) are extant. Bühler admits (S. B. E. vol. 25, p. XXXVIII) that the main pillars of his arguments are the quotations ascribed to Manu in the Vasişthadharmasūtra.</p>
<p>The four sūtras of Vasistha (IV. 5-8 ) which are the sheet anchor of Bühler&rsquo;s argument have been dealt with above under Vasiştha (pp. 102 ff). If, as Bühler says, the four sūtras are one quotation, since iti&rsquo; occurs at the end of the 8th sutra, then we have here a quotation within a quotation, as iti' occurs also in sūtra 5. But this would be absurd. Besides, sutra 8 is really summarised from some Brāhmana passage as indicated above. The proper construction of the four sūtras is as follows:- The fifth sūtra merely summarises the views of the Manusmrti to be gathered from Mann V. 41 and 48. The word “Mānavam' stands for the Manusmrti just as it does in the Tantravartika and in Viśvarūpa. Then the two verses of Manu are quoted. In the 8th sútra a Brāhmaṇa passage is cited in support of the position that sacrificing an animal is not ‘killing' (that leads to sin ).</p>
<p>As regards the few quotations which cannot be found in the extant Manusmrti the following points deserve consideration. The Vasisthadharmasūtra contains numerous verses identical with those of the Manusmrti. Most of the quotations attributed to Mapu are found in the Manusmộti. Hence even if a few quotations are not found in our Manu, we cannot at once jump to the conclusion that Vasistha had before him not the Manusmrti, but the Māna vadharma sūtra. Besides, Bühler is not right in saying that Vasiştha 11. 23, 12. 16 and 23. 43 either contradict or find no counterpart in our Manu (S. B. E. vol. 25, p. XXXIV ). Vasistha 11. 23 corresponds with Manu 3. 245-246.148 None</p>

<p>of the three contradicts anything contained in the Manusmrti. Vasistha 23. 43 (about Sisukrcchra ) has nothing correspond ing to it word for word in our Manu, but it seerns to be an echo of Manu 11.211.149 In Vasistha 12. 16 ( paryagnikaranam hy-etan-manurāha Prajāpatiḥ ) there is nothing that contra dicts our Manu; that half and the preceding verses bear a close correspondence to Baudhāyana Dh. S. I. 4. 2. Similarly, Bühler&rsquo;s argument abont Manava sloka in the Tristubh metre is not quite sound. The text of Vasistha is far from satisfa ctory. On the non-occurrence of that verse or a correspond ing sloka in our Mapu no superstructure can be built. Vasi stha quotes ( 4. 37 ) a sūtra or opinion of Gautama which is not found in the extant Gautamadharmasūtra. Verses ascri bed to Vasistha in the nibandhas are not found in the printed text of Vasistha.</p>
<p>The analogy of the works of the schools of Apastambạ and others can furnish no proof. Tbere are on the other hand weighty groupds for discarding that analogy altogether. It is a remarkable fact that excepting the three carunas (of the Black Yajurveda ) of Apustamba, Baudhāyana and Hiranya kesin that arose and tourished in the southern portion of India, no carana of any of the other Vedas has an extant dhar masutra ascribed to the founder of the sūtra-curandı. An explanation is suggested in the following lives. The Brăbina nas in southern India were in the very early days of their colonisation surrounded by an alien culture and by alien customs. It was necessary therefore to formulate distinctly the rules of general conduct for the Aryan community in.</p>

<p>History of Dharmaśāstra</p>
<p>southern India, that studied the Black Yajurveda. The same necessity did not exist in northern India, where the members of the sūtracaranas knew their ordinary every day duties very well, and were more or less a homogeneous community with the same ideals and culture. Therefore, in the beggining when manuals of Srauta and Gșhya ceremonies were first com posed, it was not thought necessary to compose set treatises on dlarına for each carana. Some of the rules of conduct were embodied in the gļhya sūtras because they were germane to the subjects treated of in them (such as the duties of brah macārins and householders, holidays etc.). Works, however, dealing with the general usages prevalent among the Aryan community in various parts of northern India must have been composed early enough. When the knowledge of the existe nce of the complete set of the sutra works in the Apastamba and other carunas of the Yajurveda in southern India perme ated to northern and central India, the leaders of the caranas cast about for works that would complete the works of their curanus and bring them in a line with those of Apastamba and others. Therefore the various caraņas seized upon seve ral dbarmasūtras and adopted them in their schools for study. This must have occurred at a comparatively early date. For Kumärila, as we saw above, enlightens us as to what dharma sūtras were specially studied in which Vedic schools. The fact that, though Gautama and Vasistha are said to have been specially studied by the students of the Sāmaveda and the Rgveda respectively, there is hardly anything in these dharma sūtras that specially connects them with the two Vedas affo rds some corroboration of the above hypothesis. This assimi lation of independent dharmasūtras into individual sūtracara ņas probably took place before or in the first centuries of the Christian era. Sabara (on Jaimini I. 3. 4 ) seems to make fun of the dharmasūtras when he says that the direction to observe brahmucarya for forty-eight years was a device of those who wanted to hide their impotence (Gautama 2. 52, Ap. Dh. S. I. 1. 2. 11-12, Baud. Dh. S. I. 2. 1 speak of brah.. macarya for 48 years ). This shows that these dharmasutras could not have been regarded as very authoritative by all early writers. Jaimini I. 3. 11 (according to Sabara ) denies</p>
<p>the independent authority of Kalpasūtras. It appears that ..the Mänava school, which according to the Caraya vyuhanson sub-division of the Maitráyaụiya, dwindled in numbers very</p>

</ol>
<p>149</p>
<p>early. Kumărila, who was a most learned and profound stu dent of the various branches of Sanskrit literature, nowhere mentioned the Mänavadharmasūtra as studied by followers of the Black Yajurveda, though he mentions Baudhāyana and Apastamba as studied by them. He places the Manusmrti even higher than the Gautamadharmasūtra and betrays no knowledge of the existence of the Mānavadharmasūtra. Vißva rūpa who is generally identified with Sureśvara, the pupil of Sankara, remarks that the Mänavacarana is not existent (or found ) 160</p>
<p>The foregoing discussion will, it is hoped, induce every impartial critic to endorse the conclusion that, on the materials so far available, the theory that the Mānavadharmasūtra once existed and that the extant Manusmrti is a recast of that Būtra must be held not proved.</p>

<p>There are three words in ancient Sanskrit Literature that are used very often in the same sepse viz. Arthasastra, Dandaniti and Rajasästra or Rājaniti or Rājanitisästra or simply Nitisästra. The Mahābhārata descants on Rāja dharma in several parvans, as in Sabhā 5 ( the chapter called kaccit-prašna), Vanaparva 150, Uddyoga (chap. 33-34). In Sabbá 5 one hundred verses occur on Rājaniti; for example, ( verse 41 refers to 18 tirthas (state dignitaries) tested by spies (as in Kaut. I. 12. 20), verse 47 refers to amātyas beyond the reach of upadhās (cf. Kauţ. I. 10. 1ff). The Santiparva devotes more than 100 chapters to Rāja dharma from chap. 56.

<p>History of Dharmasastra</p>
<p>expounders of Rājaśāstra (Rājaśästraplanetāraḥ), viz. Bphas pati, Viśālākşa, Kavya, Indra, Prācetasa Manu, Bharadvāja, Gauraśiras. Rājaniti is called “Rūjyatantra” in the Malila plate of king Dhruvasena II of the year 323 of Valabhi Gupta era (i. e. 641-42 A. D.) in JOI. (Baroda ), vol. X. No. 2 at p. 127. Rūjaniti or Nitiśästra is described as the nectar or quintessence of the ocean of Arthasüstra in Kama nadakıya Nitisāra (1. 6). Kautilya himself employs the word Rājaniti in V. 4. 3. Rājaniti (Government and Politics ) is dealt with in Dharmasūtras and smrtis also (briefly or at length ) as in Gaut. Dh. S. (X-XIII), Manu (VII-VIII ), Yājsa valkya (I. 309-68 and II. 1-307 ). Dharmaśāstras deal with all aspects of society and therefore they deal with Rājadharma also. Dandaniti is another name for the Sästra which has to be considered. Daula literally means &lsquo;a stick or staff of a tree for driving cattle (vide Rg. VII. 33. 6) but it came to mean also the power of control and punishment&rsquo; i. e. it conveys the power of the king or supreme ruler called “Dandadhara' or &lsquo;Dundadhāra&rsquo; to dispense justice and to punish wrong-doers. The Gaut. 1000 Dh. S. (XI. 28 ) states that the word &ldquo;Danda' conveys the idea of controlling (or suppressing) and (the king should keep under control (or suppress ) those who do not control themselves i. e. Dandaniti is the science of Government. Kautilya refers to it in the Arthaśāstra 1. 3-4. The Sānti</p>

<p>parva (in 59.78 ) gives the derivation of the word &lsquo;Danda niti&rsquo; (as &lsquo;Dandena niyate cedam dandam nayati vā punaḥı Daņdnitir-iti khyātā trin lokán -abhivartate Il ) and advises the king to be always ready with the rod of punishment. Manu has a grand apotheosis of Danıla&rsquo; (in VII. 14-31 ), some of the verses occurring in the Matsyapurana chap. 225. The Dasakumāracarita (VIII ) narrates that king Ananta varmã, though endowed with all good qualities, did not feel much interest in Dandaniti and states that ācārya Vinnugupta prepared a compendium of it for the Maurya ( King). Here the Arthaśāstra of Kanțilya is called Dandaniti. The Niti sāra of Kāmandaka also follows (in II. 15) Gaut. Dh. S. in deriving the word dandu, says that the power of punish ment is vested in the king and that the rules that guide the king are called Dandaniti! 1506 This means that the main purpose and province of Dandaniti is to set out the functions of the State and deal with the administration of its different organs.</p>
<p>Arthaśāstra literally means the scince of artha. Artha is one of the four purusārthas (Dharina, Artha, Kāma and Moksa ). Manu (II. 224 ) refers to different views on the respective eminence of these. The Mahābhārata and the Smrtis were well aware of the great part that artha ( material well-being, wealth ) played in men&rsquo;s lives. Wealth depended on land and labour. The Mahābhanya remarks &ldquo;a country is called ' arthavan' which has cows and crops&rdquo; (arthavān ayam desa ucyate yasmin yavah sasyâni ca vartante ) on Vārtika 4 in Pán. V. 2. 135 (Kielhorn&rsquo;s ed. Vol. II. p. 40). The Drona parva (7.1) speaks of Minari Arthavidyā ano Vanaparva ( 35.21 ) states that Manu declared Rājadharmas. Unless there existed some authority that regulated the people and their doings there would have been chaos and no security. Hence the ruler or the king was the most important institution in society and rules for the king&rsquo;s guidance were called Rājadharma or Rajaniti. Arthaśāstra therefore came to be identified with Rajaustiśāstra ( or simply Nītiśāstra ). A special vame (viz. Värta ) was viven to the three viz. agriculture, rearing cattle, trade and commerce (vānijyuy. including various arts. Vide Sabhāparva 5. 83, Vanapambe</p>

The Rāmāyaṇa also (II. 100. 47 ) says &lsquo;this world when it resorts to Vārtā prospers happily (vārtāyām samsritastāta lokoyam sukham-edhate )&rsquo;. Kautilya makes it clear that Arthaśāstra and Vārtā were distinct and yet Vārtā was a subject of study for the king; it was one of the three or four Rajavidyās (vide Arthaśāstra I. 4. 4, Manu VII. 43).</p>
<p>Arthasāstra ju its technical sense is somewhat wider in meaning than Dandapīti and includes politics, economics, law and justice, but was narrower in scope than Dharma sastra. It was said to be an Upaveda of the Atharvaveda, according to the Vişnupurāna 180d III. 6. 28, Vāyu 61. 79 and Brahmānda 35. 88-89. It is therefore stated by Yāj. ( II. 21 ) that in case of conflict between Dharmaśāstra and Arthaśāstra the former is stronger. The Mit, on Yüj. makes this clear ( vide note below ). 1606</p>
<p>Mr. Ramakrishna Kavi first contributed a paper to J. V. O. I. ( Tirupati ) Vol. I. pp. 79-89 on Cāksusiya Artha sästra and in Vol. III. (pp. 99-116 ) published the text of that work in four patalas. In J. V. 0. I. Vol. IV he con tributed an Introduction (pp. 123-128 ) and notes on the sutras (pp. 129-140 and in Vol. VI. pp. 129-140). The text of Cākşusiya begins with a verse saying that it is possible for a single man (or in one birth ) following the path of Nitiśāstra to conquer the earth provided he has the necessary effort (or determination ). The first sūtra is &lsquo;Now then I shall expound Arthasāstra which is the means of accomplishing the goals of human existence&rsquo;. Then in 67 sutras it enumerates the topics of Arthaśāstra and covers almost the same topics as are found in Kautilya&rsquo;s Artha. sāstra. A few sūtras (which are all brief ) may be set out here by way of sample. (1) Sapta prakrtayaḥ; ( 2 ) Sapta vidhå pravrttih; (3) Sapta vyasanāni; (5) tisro vidyāḥ;</p>

<p>Mr. Kavi (Vol. I. pr. 84ff'), relying on the name Cāksusīya (Caksusa was one of the first seven Manus acc. to Manusmrti I. 62.) and the close correspondence of certain sutras of the Cākşusiya with the sūtras in Arthaśāstra, holds that Kautilya borrows from the Cāksusiya (p. 82 of J. V. 0. I. Vol. I). This is quite wrong. The reality is just the opposite of this. It is ridiculuous to hold that the erudite author of the Arthaśāstra had to borrow from a small beginner&rsquo;s primer for his work of vast extent. Besides, the extant Kautiliya quotes several individual predecessors such as Kaunapadanta, Pisuna, Bāhudantiputra, Bhāradvāja (and once Kaninka Bh.), Vatavyādhi and Viśālākṣa and a few schools such as the Ambhiyas, Aušanasas, Pārāśaras, Bárhas patyas and Māpavas, but nowhere mentions the Caksusiya. Moreover, while the Arthaśāstra of Kautilya or Canakya or Vişnugupta is expressly named or quoted or referred to by numerous writers and works from at least the 3rd century A. I)., such as the Tantrākhyāyikī, the Kāmasūtra, Kima ndakiyanitisāra, the Pañcatantra, Būna, Dandin, the Mudra rākşasa, hardly any writer or work of the centuries from the 3rd to the 8th has been shown to have mentioned the Cākṣusiya. Some verges are quoted from the Cūksusīya Artha śrstra in an anthology called Süktiratnakara ( vide J. B. O. R. S. Vol. XI. pp. 81-84). Mr. Ramkrishna Kavi (in J. V. 0. I. Vol. IV. p. 123 ) says that thirteen verses are quoted from Cāksusiya in Sūktiratnākara, of which only eight are found in the mss. used by him.</p>
<p>This short primer for beginners in Arthaśāstra quotes a verse, a prose passage and sometimes several verses on most of the stras (except on sūtras 36, 38, 43, 45, 51, 52, 55-64). The verses are often preceded by such words as &lsquo;atra slokāh&rsquo;, thereby intimating that they are quotations from some other work or works, for example, on II. 2 it quotes nine versek which either closely agree with Mann or state the same ideas in similar words viz. Manu IX. 303-11; on II. 3 it TEK &lsquo;atra slokāḥ,&rsquo; which closely agree with the extant Manu V!! 50-51. On II, 21 the Cākṣußīya sets out A prose passagerantlind</p>

<p>then a verse which is the same as Manu, ( VIII. 26 &lsquo;äkārair ingitair-gatyā &hellip; &hellip; &hellip; manaḥ&rsquo;). On II. 4 it quotes four verses, one of which has the half verse &lsquo;yadenam kşamayā yuktam&ndash;asaktam manyate janah&rsquo; (which is Udyoga parva 33. 48 and Santi. 160. 34 ). It is remarkable that at the end of the 2nd patala (on sūtra 24 ) it has a verse in Sragdhara metre. Mr. Kavi states that only one verse in the Cāksusiya (IV. 64, that has nine verses in it ) occurs in Manu (VII. 105 ) but, as shown above, the Cāksusiya quotes (on II. 21 ) Manu VIII. 26 and adapts several other verses of the Manu smrti with slight changes.</p>
<p>The publication of the Arthaíñstra of Kautilya was a great event and this work will have an abiding interest and value for all time. Dr. Jolly in his Introduction to his edition of the work described it as &lsquo;perhaps the most precious work in the whole range of Sanskrit Literature&rsquo; (p. 1).</p>
<p>It was first published in 1909 by Dr. R. Shama Sastri in the Mysore Sanskrit Series. In 1915 he published an English translation of the whole with an Introductory note by Dr. J. F. Fleet and a Preface dealing with its authenticity and age. Revised editions of the text were published by him in 1919 and 1924 and his son published an edition of the text and translation in 1951. Another edition (in two parts ) by Dr. Jolly and Dr. R. Schmidt was published in 1923 by Messrs Motilal Banarasidas of Lahore with an English Intro duction of 47 pages and (Vol. II) with notes and a Sanskrit commentary called Nayacandrika by Madhavayajvan on a large part of the text (i. e. from adhikarana VII to XII). M. M. T. Ganapati Sastri published the Arthaśāstra with his own commentary called Srimüla in 1924 in three parts. Recently Prof. R. P. Kangle edited the text prepared from all the available mss. material and the University of Bombay published it as the first volume of the text with a glossary (in 1960) and a second volume with an English translation and explanatory notes was published in 1963 and a third volume containing a study of the Arthaśnstra will soon follow. In this revised edition of the first volume of the H. of Dh. Prof. R. P. Kangle&rsquo;s edition of the text published in 1960 has been used.</p>

<p>This work bas given rise to frequent and furious coutro versies about its authorship, its authenticity and its age and it cannot be said that we have heard the last of this din of controversy. Moreover, this work has inspired, besides nume. rous articles in journals, several monographs, some of which have somewhat high sounding titles, such as Narendranath Law&rsquo;s Studies in Ancient Indiau Polity,&rsquo; Dr. P.

<p>The Kautiliya is the oldest extuut work on Arthusastra. Though Arthaśāstra and Dharmaśāstra are often contradisti nguished on accouut of the difference of the two śāstras in ideals and in the methods adopted to reach them, Arthashstra is really a branch of Dharmaśāstra as the former deals with the responsibilities of kings for whom rules are laid down in many treatises on dlocrna. 181 For this reason and the fur ther reason that the Kauţiliya contains two sections (called dharmasthiya and kantakasodhana ) on the administration of justice, the Arthaśāstra of Kautilyu deserves careful conside ration in this work. According to the Caranavyuha of Sau naka, Arthaśāstra is an Upaveda of Atharvaveda. The pur pose of this Šāstra as stated in the Kauțiliya itself is &lsquo;to pre scribe means for securing and preserving (power over ) the earth. &lsquo;152 Yājñavalkya distinctly states (II. 21) that in 151 TETTE FONÀT Tratfattat fatia iti Parapente fino on</p>

<p>case of conflict between Dharmaśāstra and Arthaśāstra, the rule is that the former prevails. 153 Nārada also ( I. 39 ) says the same thing 154</p>
<p>That there was in India a great deal of thinking on roli tics, economics, law and administration of justice several cen turies before Christ is clear from the Mahābhārata and the early Dharmasūtras like those of Gautama, Baudhāyana and Apastamba. In the Säntiparva the word Nitiśāstra is frequ ently used in the sense of political science. For example, Sānti 138. 196 states that &lsquo;avisvāsa&rsquo; (not putting trust in anybody) is briefly the essence of all Nitiśīstras.1548 Vide also Sānti 111. 73, 138. 39 and 43. It has already been shown that the Santiparva names several expounders of Nitiśāstra. Brhaspatimata is frequently quoted in the great Epic on poli tics and connected matters. Bphaspati is said to be the son of Angiras ( Adiparva 76. 19). The Sabhāparva ( 55. 6) men tions as the opinion of Brhaspati that the conduct or life of kings is different from the (rules of conduct of common men.1646 The Udyoga Parva states that Bphaspati declared that one should give battle to an (enemical) army which is smaller by one-third than one&rsquo;s own army.1640 Bhisina parva quotes the dictum of Brhaspati that one who has a sinall army should present a compact front, while one who has a large army should spread it out1649 and then a reference is made to a &lsquo;vyūha&rsquo; called Vajra (19. 7). The same parva speaks of a vyuha called Krauñcīruna (in 50. 40 ) which was suggested to Indra by Brhaspati; a vyūha called Krauńca is mentioned in Drona-parvan (7.25). It is noteworthy that Kautilya deals with vyvhus in X. O and in the first sūtra refers to the arrangement of a vyúha according to Ušanas and</p>

X. 6. 35, that a syena array is mentioned by Kautilya (X. 6. 12), though not Krauñca and that an array called Sakata is mentioned in the Dronaparva 7. 24, which occurs in Kauțiliya also (at X. 6. 26 ).</p>
<p>Sānti ( 69. 23-24 ) states that Bilaspati advises a wise king desirous of securing his kingdom to avoid war and to accomplish his object by the three upayas, appeasement, offer of gift, or bheila ( sowing discord ) and to be satisfied with what he would be able to secure by the first three. 154€ Santiparvan ( 59. 59 ) states that, according to the Acāryas, the vices ( vyorsunas) of kings are ten in all, either due to Kopa (anger ) or to kām ( lust ).14f The first category consists of six vices, viz. väkpärusya (harshness of speech ), danda pārusya (harshness due to physical punishment ), arthadisana (violation of property ) and three others; the vices due to lust are four, vix, hunting, gambling, women and drinking. The Manusmrti (in VII. 47-8 ) speaks of ten vices due to lust and eight vices due to anger. The Kautiliya (VIII. 3 ) reduces the vices lue to lust to four and the vices due to anger to three only and holds a long discussion abont the comparative harm caused by these. The word Kantaka sodhana (suppression of criminals ) occurs in Sānti 59. 5:3. According to the view of Bihaspati, obtaining of wealth is secured in four ways viz. that due to parumpaerya (inheri tance from ancestors ), that dne to good fortune, that due to one&rsquo;s ardent desire to acquire and that derived from a</p>

<p>friend. 154g In Sablñparva ( 74. 7-8) Duryodhana tells his father that acc. to Bșhaspati enemies should be killed by employing all kinds of means.</p>
<p>In the Vanaparva (32. 61 ) Draupadi says that her brothers were taught the Nīti of Brhaspati and in Vana. 150. 29 it is stated that men are supported by (or held to the right path ) by rules promulgated by Brhaspati154h and Ušanas. In the Karna parva it is said that a certain Vyüha ( array of army) was arranged according to the opinion of Bphaspati and Uśanas ( 31. 12-13). Vide Karnaparva 46. 27 for Bärhaspatya Vycha. Salyaparva states that, acc. to Bịhaspati&rsquo;s view, a king who is weak should desire to make peace (with a stronger one) or with his equal, while one who is growing in strength should desire conflict.254; Santi ( 23. 15 ) quotes a gathā of Brhaspati and in 56. 39 quotes &amp; verse from Bärhasptyaśāstra (both quoted in the note ) to the effect that low people may disrespect a king who is always forbearing, just as the rider of an elephant desires to sit on the head of it. 154; In Santiparva a verse is quoted from Brhaspati&rsquo;s work as recited by Marutta in the section on kings viz. &lsquo;that punishment should follow even in the case of a guru who has become conceited, who fails to disting uish between what is proper to be done or is improper and takes to a bad course of conduct ’.154* Sānti ( 122. 11 ) speaks</p>

<p>History of Dharmaśāstra</p>
<p>of a king as having studied the whole of Bphaspatimata and Aušanasaśāstra. Sānti 59. 51 refers to &lsquo;Saptāngarājya&rsquo;; Manu IX. 294 and Kautilya ( VI. 1. 1 ) also mention the seven constituent elements.</p>
<p>Sāntiparva states that Brhaspati prescribed Utthāna ( effort, endeavour ) for kings and as the basis of rājadharma and recites verses thereon.1547 Kautilya also says that a king should bring about the acquisition of what is not gained (Yoga) and protection of what is obtained by effort (Uttha nena Yogaksemasādhanam, J. 7.1 ). Vide H. of Dh. Vol. II pp. 914-15, Vol. II pp. 588&ndash;589, Vol. V. pp. 1385-6 for a dis. cussion of the meaning of yogaksema.</p>
<p>The passages quoted above from different parvans of the Mahābhārata (not only from Säntiparva ) show that the author of the Mahabharata had before him a treatise of Bșhaspati on Arthaśāstra, that it was extensive, contained verses and that it was divided into parts or chapters called ' Adhikāra ' like &lsquo;adhikarana&rsquo; in Kautilya.</p>
<p>It may be noted that Aśvaghosa in his Buddhacarita ( I. 46 ) mentions the Rājaśāstras produced by Sukra, son of Bhrgu and Brhaspati, son of Aigiras.154m Kalidasa in Kumārasambhava ( III. 6 ) mentions the Niti of Usanas.</p>
<p>Brhaspati&rsquo;s Artha Sastrn appears to have contained a legendary beginning that what Bphaspati, the preceptor of the Gods, taught Inilra is contained in the treatise of Bșhaspati.</p>

<p>The present Manusmrti contains a similar assertion that Brahmā taught Mapu and the latter taught it to Marici, Bhrgu and others ( Manu I. 35-36 and 58 ) and Bhigu at the order of Manu transmitted the Sāstra to the sages ( I. 60 and 119 ). Such fabulous accounts were introduced in ancient works to heighten the authority of the teaching. The Birhas patyas mentioned in the Arthasästra were probably those who relied on the treatise of Brhaspati, and Kautilya differed from their teaching in I. 2. 4-5, V. 15. 48 (they required that 16 persons constituted a council of Ministers ), II. 7. 13 ( those superintendents who caused loss of revenue should be fined ten times the loss ), in III. 11. 40 (punishment for witnesses who lead to a wrong judgment), III. 17. 13 (on fine for him who instigated another to commit an oflence ).</p>
<p>Usaņas is another ancient sage who appears to have composed a treatise on Arthasastra. That Kävya Usauas was à sage of hoary antiquity even in Rgvedic times would be indicated below (under Uśanas). Several passages from Uśanas mentioned in the great Epic would be cited there. The Asramavāsikaparva states that the Vyūhas called Sakata, Padma and Vajra have been declared in the Sāstra of Usanas. 154n The Vyüha called Sakata is mentioned in the Arthasāstra X. 6. 26 and Vajra in X. 6. 35. The Manusmrti in VII. 187 mentions six Vyūlas viz. Dandu, Sakața, Varāha, Makara, Suci, Garuda, and in VII. 188 mentious Padmavyuha and Vajra in VII. 191.</p>
<p>It is clear that the author of the Mahabharata had before him a treatise by Usanas on Rājaniti, which went into such details as the names of certain Vyūhas. Manu (VII. 146 and 151 ) provides that the king should hold in a secret place a meeting of the councillors and sets out the subjects on which the king has to hold counsel with thein (mantrins ) and one verse (VII. 154 )1640 refers to the eightfold actions of the king 1540 372119979T THË 957 (751 ) HRT I 3771 OF TESTET</p>

<p>and the group of five kinds of spies and Kalpataru (on Rāja. dharma p. 108 ) quotes two verses of Uśanas in which the eight are enumerated. Ausunasi-nīti is mentioned in the Mudrārāksasa just before I. 15.</p>
<p>For Bhāra vāja vide below. Not only in the Maha bhārata but also in the Rāmāyana there is a good deal of the principles and phraseology of Arthaśāstra. There is a chapter called Kaccit-praśna in the Rāmāyana ( Ayodhyākānda 100) just as there is one in Sabhåparva (chap. 5). We have</p>
<p>adevamātřko deśaḥ&rsquo; (Rām. Ayodhya 100. 25 4s in Kauti līya V. 2. 2 and VI, 1. 8). The same story of king Nrga, who donated &amp; Brāhmana&rsquo;s cow by mistake and became a chome leon because he did not speedily deal with the dispute, is nar rated in Anusāsana parva 6. 38 und Asramedbika-parva 90. 99-100 and in the Rāmāyana, Uttarakānda, chap. 53. 6-26. Not only in the epics, but in some of the Purānas also Rājadharma is treated at some length. For example, the Matsya Purana devotes severel chapters (225-229 ) to Rājadharma that deal with the suhāyas of the king, the conduct of the king&rsquo;s servants, fortress and its equipments. Fate and human effort, the Upāyas, sāma, dāna, bheda, danda ; time for invasion etc.</p>
<p>From very early times, Visnugupta alias Canakya or Kauțilya has been credited with the composition of a work on Arthasāstra. The Kamandakiya-viti-sāra285 pays a glowing tribute of praise to Visnugupta, who single-handed brought about the downfall of the Nandas and bestowed the earth on Candragupta by the force of his political strategy and who distilled from the ocean of Arthaśāstra the quintessence of (his work on ) Nītiśāstra. Kāmandaka tells us further that he looked upon Vişnugupta as Guru.158 The Tantrákhyā.</p>

<p>yikā ( the earliest version of the Pañcatantra ), which, accord ing to Hertel ( H.O.S.), is not later than 300 A. D., pays its homage to167 Cānakya the great, as one of the authors of the treatises on Rājaśāstra along with Manu, Bșhaspati, Sukra, Parāśara and his son. Dandin in his Dasakumāracarita in several places and particularly in section VIII (ed. of B. S. S. 1891 ) furnishes very important evidence of the names of the author of the Arthuśāstra and actually quotes several passa ges. Only a few are mentioned (in the note ).188 “There are four lores for the King and then says &lsquo;Dandanīti was sum marised in 6000 Sloka units by the Ācārya Vişnugupta for the benefit of the Maurya king&rsquo;. Then it refers to the &lsquo;forty ways of embezzlement indicated by Cinakya&rsquo; (i. e. Artha Sastra II. 8. 20-21 ). It is clear from the Dasakumāra carita that Dandin regarded Visnugupta as the author of the Arthasāstra and identified him with Cāņakya.</p>

<p>History of Dhurmuścīstra</p>
<p>Let us now turn to the Mudrārāksasa,159 from which a few passages are quoted below. It refers to Kautilya as &lsquo;Kutila muti&rsquo; (of crooked intellect) in 1. 7 .Kautilyaḥ Kutilamatih su esa yena krodhāynan prasabham-adāhi Nandavamsah&rsquo;, and again in Act IV. 2 there is a reference to the crooked intellect of Kautilya (api ca kuțilim Kautilyasya prucintayato matim ). Again, in Cānakya&rsquo;s speech in Mudrārā kşasa before 1. 22 anyac-ca-Nandam-iva Visnuguptah &amp;c.&rsquo; it is clearly showu that Vişnugupta and Canakya ure identical, according to the author of the Mudrārāksasa. Malayaketu boasts (V. 22)</p>
<p>I am able to uproot Vinnugupta and Maurya even if they come ( together ) with you ( Rāksasa )'. Here the author clearly shows that Vişnugupta is identical with Cāņakya and Kautilya. There is a striking passage towards the end of the play after VII. 9, where Căŋakya addresses Raksasa (whom the former has won over to the side of Candragupta ) <em>I, Visnugupta, otter salutatiou to you' (Vişnuguptoham abhivādaye ) and Raksasa responds by saying &lsquo;Bho Virņu. gupta&rsquo; when a little before (i. e. before VII. 6) Rāksasa had said (nivedyatam duritmaue Cånakyāya.' These passages establish beyond doubt that, according to Visakhadatta, Kau ţilya, Cāņakya and Vişnugupta were the names of the same persou and, from the way in which abhivadunc was perfor med, it appears that the dramatist believed that Visnugupta was the original name given at the time of Nämakarana.</em> Manu (II. 121 ) prescribes that a brālimana making abhiva dana to a person older (than himself) should pronounce his own name with the words &lsquo;here do I bow, so and so by name&rsquo;. Vide H. of Dh. Vol. II, pp. 330-337 for discussion on abhivādana.</p>

<p>There was a great divergence of views about the time when a child was given a name. Vide I. H. Q. (1938) Vol. 14 pp. 24 44 (the author&rsquo;s paper on giving a name to a child ) and H. of Dh. Vol. II pp. 238 ft. Several authorities prescribed that Nāmakarana should primarily be performed on the 10th or 12th day after birth ( Baud. Gr. II. 1. 23, Pār. Gr. I. 17 and Manu 11. 30). There were various rules at different times about what name should be given. One of the rules was that the name may be derived from that of a sage or of a deity or may be the same as the name of an ancestor (Baud. Gr. II. 1. 28-29 and Mänavagrhya I. 18). The name Vişnugupta would* be in accordance with these rules, but not Canakya necessari ly. Kautilya would only be a gotra name or a nickname. The wame Canakya may have been due to the place whence the author&rsquo;s family came or where he was born, just as Pánini is called Salāturiya from Salūtura occurring in Pā. IV. 3. 93 ). In the Parisistaparva of Hemacandra (ed. by Jacobi, Calcutta 1883 ) on p. 55 of the Introduction it is stated that Canaka was a village in Colla District and Canakya was born of a Brāhmana called Canin who resided there. Verse VIII. 339 states that Candragnpta became king 155 years after Mahāvīra passed away. His paternal grandfather or some more remote ancestor might have borne the name Canaka and so he was called Canakya (according to &lsquo;Gaigñdibhyo yan&rsquo; (Pān. IV. 1. 105 ), Canaka being one of the numerous words under Gargādi-yana.' We have Cārāyana and Katyāyana (in Artha. V. 5. 11), Cara being included in the Nadadi-gana ( Päin. IV. I. 99) as the 2nd word. Vide the Nidhanapur plates of Bhaskara-varman (of Kamarūpa) in E. I.

<p>doubt that, whatever the exact date of the Nidhanpur grant may be, Bhāskara varman flourished in the first half of the 7th century.</p>
<p>Dandin flourished not later than 700 A. D.; vide the author&rsquo;s History of Sanskrit Poetics ( ed. of 1961 ) pp. 119-120 and the discussion that precedes. The date of Mudrārākşasa is rather debatable. It depends upon what is the correct rea ding of the last pāda in the Bharatavākya.100 The Bharata. vākya in the Mudrārākşaša is put in the mouth of Raksasa in some mss. and in that of Canakya in others. The word * Bharatavākya' literally means the speech of the Bharata or of Bharatas' (&lsquo;Bharatā ityapi naţāḥ&rsquo; says Amarakośa ). The Nātyaśāstra does not define the word. Therefore, we have to rely upon the practice of early and great Sanskrit dramatists to find what the word exactly implies. In some of the great Sanskrit dramas, Bharatavāk yas are general in tone, asking for the welfare and happiness of the people (particularly of good men), long and healthy life, good government, good rains, good crops, fame and prosperity to poets &amp;c., as in the Vikra morvasiya, Mahāviracarita, Mālatimādhava, Ratnāvali, Veni samhāra, Mrcchakatika. In the Mālavikā° the last rerse requests the queen always to bestow her favours on him and adds that as long as Agnimitra is the protector of the subje cts, it is not necessary to invoke such blessings as the absence of floods, drought, locusts, invasions &amp;c. The Sākuntala ends on two notes. The first half says &lsquo;may the king be assiduous in bringing about welfare to the people and may the literary efforts of those whose learning is great become famous.&rsquo; The second half is &lsquo;may the self-existent Siva eliminate re-birth in my case.&rsquo; It is difficult to hold thut this refers to an indi</p>

<p>vidual actor (the word &lsquo;mama&rsquo; being there ). It must refer to Dugyanta, who is the last to speak (before the benediction) and possibly there is another suggested meaning that expres ses the yearning of the poet Kálidāsa himself. Therefore, it is not quite accurate to say that the Bharatavākya is no part of the drama or that it is a chorus by all the actors ; in that case &lsquo;mama&rsquo;in the Sākuntala would be inappropriate. The dramatist was to write the Bharatavākya and it is possible that several dramas though they contained Bharataväkya were not or could not be put on the stage at all. The Bharata vakya, thought not an essential part of the action of the play, is still said by one of the prominent characters in the play. Avantivarman has nothing to do with the drama or the chara cters therein. The proper reading is therefore &lsquo;pĀrthivas candraguptah.&rsquo; It is proper to hold that Canakya, who is the dominant character of the story of the drama, recites that benediction. The poet Visakhadatta was the grandson of a sāmanta (feudatory chief) Vațeśvaradatta and the son of Mahārāja (king) Bhaskaradatta and therefore it would be a fine piece of flattery if there be an oblique or indirect refere nce to Emperor ( Mahārājādhiraja ) Candragupta in the words of the drama. The Gupta Emperor Candragupta II ruled till 414 A. D. Vide Fleet&rsquo;s Gupta Inscriptions (1888) p. 15 and JBORS Vol. 30 pp, 1-46. If the poet flourished under him the drama was composed about 400 A. D. Taking Avanti varman as the king meant in the Bharatavākya (which is very unlikely ), the draina must have been composed in the latter half of the 6th century, as Avantivarman took a great part in vanquishing the Hūnas about 582 A. D. Vide 1. H. Q. Vol. 30 (1930) pp. 175-178 and pp. 485-6 for a discussion on Bharata vākya.</p>
<p>The Kámandakiyanitisara highly praises Vinnugupta as shown above. The date of Kimanduka is also debatable. I showed so far back as 1911 ( in I. A. for 1911 p. 236 ) that Vāmana in his Kävyšlankārasūtra quoted from some work not available now a half verse Kāmam Kimandaki nitirasyā rasyā divānisam&rsquo; as an example of one variety of Yamaka. Dr. Jolly in his haste to dispose of evidence against his part theory treats this in a slipshod manner and gives a note on p. 8 (of Introduction) that the 8th century seems to be the most likely date of the Nitisūra of Kūmandaka. I shoes that Vimana quotes a half verge not from the Nitisãg but</p>
<p>STITUDE</p>
<p>UNDED</p>
<p>170</p>
<p>History of Dharmaścīstra</p>
<p>from some work in which occurs the statement the dhi (intellect of some person ) indeed day and night enjoys (the reading of ) Kamandaki-niti'. Vāmana in his own vịtti on IV. 6. 2 states that Yamakas are treated at length in a work called Hariprabodha. That work is now not available. Vāmana elsewhere expressly says that the examples he gives are mostly from others (parakiyaisca puskalaih). It would have been a long time before the Nitisāra became famous. A work now unknown refers to it and a half verse from that work is quoted as an example of a figure of speech by the rhetorician Vāmana ( from Kashmir ). This might take centuries. The Nitisāra may be centuries earlier than 800 A. D. for all we know. Kāmandaka further tells us that he looked upon Visnugupta as his Guru. In the Sāntiparva (chap. 123 ) there is a dialogue between Kāmandaka and Angarista, king of Anga. The name Kamandaka is thus comparatively ancient.</p>
<p>There is nothing to prevent us from holding that the Nītisāra of KĀmandaka may belong even to the third century A. D. I am here concerned only with showing that Dr. Jolly did not carefully consider the matter and is wrong in putting the Kūmandakiyanitisāra in the 8th century A. D. when he agreed to put Vāmana about 800 A. D. It is surprising that Winternitz also refers the Arthaśāstra to the 3rd century A.D. (p. 28 of Cal. Review, April-June, 1924). Dr. Jolly un. necessarily parades patent facts e. g. he remarks (on p. 11 ) that the Bșhatsamlită (chap. 78.1 ) contains nearly the same list of princes killed in their harem as the Arthasāstra (I. 20. 15-17). In the first place, the list is not quite the same. But, apart from that, one would like to know what conclusion he draws from the fact that the Brhatsarhitā contains some or most cases of treachery mentioned by Kautilya is not clear. As he holds that A. belongs to the 3rd century A. D. it is clear that if there is a borrowing it is Varahamihira who borrows (as the latter flourished in the first-half of the Gth century A. D.). The Harsacarita (VI) mentions these cases and several more. The Nitisāra (VII. 51-54 ) also mentious these cases of treachery.</p>
<p>The Kathāsaritsagara of Somadeva (in the Kathåpitha. lambaka chap. 5 verses 108&ndash;124 ) refers to the story of Canakya having brought about the death of Yogananda and placed Candragupta ( pūrvanandasuta ) on the Magadhat throne. That work purports to give successfully the context</p>
<ol start="14">
<li>The Arthugăstrou of Kuulilya</li>
</ol>
<p>171</p>
<p>of the Brhatkatha ( 1. 1. 3), avers that it closely follows the original, does not depart even slightly from it and that only the language differs and there is abridgment in it and some detail (I. 1. 10). The Brhatkathă of Gupādhya is supposed to have been composed in the Paiśnci dialect about the first century A. D. It is mentioned by Bina in Harsacarita ( Intro. verse 17 ) and in Dandin&rsquo;s Kavyadarśa ( I. 38 ). The Brhat kathāmañjari of Ksemendra ( II. 216 ) refers to the story that Cánakya brought about the death of Yogananda (by magic ) and placed Candragupta ( described as &lsquo;pūrvanandasutah&rsquo;) on the throne.</p>
<p>So far I have dealt with works that name Visugupta, Cănakya and Kautilya singly or collectively and the dates of which though not very certain can be fixed within narrow limits. Now I shall refer to some Purānas which mention Candragupta and his minister Kautilya. There are five Puranas that have chiefly to be considered viz. Váyu 199. 326-332, Brahmandu III. 74, Visnu (IV. 24, 25-33 in prose), Bhāgavata (XII. 17 ) und Mats yn ( 272. 19-26). The Matsya account is rather defective; Viyu aud Brahmanda agree, Višņu and Bhagavata agree. All tive say in a prophetic vein that Nandas will rule for 100 years, that Kautilya would uproot the Nandas and place Candragupta on the throne, the latter will rule for 24 years, his son Bindusāra ( Bhadragāra in Väyu ) for 25 years and Asoka (grandson ) will rule for 36 years. Some mention niue Maurya kings and others men tion ten kings, but all agree that the dynasty will rule for 137 years, though there is difference in the number and sequence of kings. Four Puranas (except the Matsya ) appear to refer to Guptavanisa but do not nume even the great conqueror Samudragupta. Therefore, it may be argued with great probability that they took their present form about 320-335 A. D. It is not necessary to enter into details here. Those interested in the Purāna historcial traditions may refer to pages 842-861 of the fifth volume of the H. of Dh, and to &amp; paper by Mr. H. G. Sustri in JOI ( Baroda ) Vol. IX pp. 387-392. The Dipavariisa, of the 5th ceutury A. 1), and a Ceylonese Chronicle, supports the Paurinic account so far that Candragupta&rsquo;s son was Bindusāra, whose son Piyadassi (or Asoka or Piyadassana ) and that Asoka Tan crowned king 218 years after the passing away of Buddhaper ( VI. 14-15) and that Candragupita ruled for twenty-four172</p>
<p>· llistory of Dhurmuścīstra</p>
<p>years (Dipavamśa V. 73 and 100 ), as the Prirõras say. The Mahāvamsa (Geiger&rsquo;s ed, of 1908, I. 5. 10-20 ) states that Canakya, after killing the 9th Nanda, will anoint as king Candragupta Maurya (a Ksatriya), that he will rule 24 years, his son Bindusāra will rule for 28 years, then Asoka, after killing his brothers will be anointed king.</p>
<p>It is known from Greek, Buddhist and Jain sources and Indian inscriptions that Candragupta, Bindusara and Asoka were historic persons. We know from Greek sources that Candragupta and Seleucus, the successor of Alexander the Great in the East, formed an alliance and that Seleucus ceded to Candragupta parts of Gedrosia ( Baluchistan ), Arachosia ( Kandābāra ) and Paropamisadae (i. e. Kabul ), all of which stretched up to the Indus ), vide Tarn on the Greeks in Bact ria and India &lsquo;, 1938, p. 100 and Cambridge Ancient History, Vol. VI. pp. 413-14 ( which gives a brief note on what Erato sthenes says about this treaty ). Similarly, the accounts in Matsya (272. 18-23 ), Vāyu chap. 99. 326-337 and other Purānas about Pusyamitra and his descendants and about the Sātavāhanas have been found to be substantially correct from the Sunga Inscription from Ayodhyā (E. I. Vol. 20 p. 54 ), Nanaghat, Nasik and other Inscriptions. There is no reason, except unreusonable 828 picion and prejudice, why the conne ction of Kautilya or Canakya with Candragupta mentioned in the Purānas ( as in Matsya 272. 22 and Väyu 99. 330-1), and the Mahāvansa anıl other early literature should not be held to be at least probable. The embellishments and fabulous trappings of the story may not be taken seriously. But the core of the story should be accepted as quite probable and should not be rejected unceremoniously. Alexander&rsquo;s was not a conquest of India in the ordinary sense of the word, the sense in which Alexander conquered Persia (see Tarn in the work cited p. 131 ). Tarn states (ibid, p. 174 notes 2 and 3) that some writers have put forward the theory that in the treaties between Candragupta and Seleucus there was a grant by the Iudian king to the Greeks of the right to intermarry in the Ksatriya-varna and Taru appears to hold that Candragupta&rsquo;s marriage with a daughter of Seleucus might have taken place ( note 3 ). The Cambridge H. of India ( Vol. I. p. 472 ) observes . for Seleucus the task of meeting Candragupta in war proved too great. Seleucus was content to secure a safe retirement and a gift of 500 elephants by the surrender of all the Grecker</p>
<ol start="14">
<li>The Arthuśīstre of Kautilyo</li>
</ol>
<p>173</p>
<p>dominions as far as the Kabul valley&rsquo;. This shows that Candragupta was a very capable man and therefore his cause was espoused by Cănakya who hailerl from Gāndhāra. Dr. Chhabra ( in the Woolner Commemoration Voluine pp. 51-52) suggests that in the story in the Rāmāyana (Uttarakānda 100-101 ) about the war between Bharata and his sons Taksa and Puskala on the one hand and Sailūsa on the other, Sailūga stands for Seleucus. At present there is nothing but the phonetic resemblance of the two words in favour of this idea.</p>
<p>It is knowu that l&rsquo;orns first fought with Alexander but later on he became reconciled to him ( Tarn&rsquo;s work p. 169 ); however, other people in North-West India fought despera tely with Alexander (ibil!. Alexander died in 323 B. C. It is highly probable that Parvataka mentioned as the father of Malayaketu in the Mudrürūknasa is the king Porus who (after first opposing Alexander) had become an ally of the Greeks in Alexander&rsquo;s days ( Tarn pr. 46, 169 ). Some Jaina sources put the accession of Caudragupta at 312 or 313 B. C. (vide Cambridge History of India vol. I, 1922 p. 698 and Bhattasali in J. R. A. S. 1932 pp. 273, 284 ). Tarn suggests that Candragupta seized Magudha in 321 B. C. and completad the conquest of the whole of Northern Iudia (including the countries in the Northwest) by 312 B. C. (vide Tarn&rsquo;s work p. 47 n. 3). Much of this history is conjectural. One thing is quite clear that Candragupta got possession of some territory to the West of the Indus and secured some parts in the Panjab and also the crowu of Magadha. But the sequence of the several events is not clear and not beyond debate. From the Mudrārāksasa it appears that Candragupta first secured Panjab (probably with the help of Canakya and his suppor ters) in addition to what he got ceded by Seleucus, that Cánakya was most probably from Gandhūra, as in his treat ment of Vāk pārūsya (damage or injury by words ) be says (A. III. 18. 8 ) by that ( what precedes) are explained the defamation concerning the learning of professional story tellers and libel of the country of those who come from the country of Prajjunaka und Gaudhara'. As Gandhāra is specially mentioned here from among the dozens of countries in the continent of Iudia, it follows with great probability that he was born there or had lived there long. The story of Mudráraksasa shows that in the times of that author it wako believeil that Parvataki was killed by foul meuus, that oration</p>

<p>ments worn by Parvataka had fallen into the hands of Candra gupta (Act I just before verse 19 ) and verse 19 refers to five chiefs of North-West India as the most prominent among Mleccha chiefs. According to Greek sources, Porns was killed before B. C. 318 (Tarn&rsquo;s work p. 46). The Mudrārāksasa opens when Candragupta had recently occupied the Magadha throne. In Act II of the Mudrārāksasa we read ( before verse 14 ) that Kusumapura ( the capital of Magadha ) had been invested by the army of Candragupta and Parvateśvara which consisted mostly of Sakas, Yavanas, Kirātas, Kambojas, Pārasikas and Bāhlikas and supported by the counsels of Cāņakya. This means that for securing the capital of Magadha soldiers from the Northwest of India had been brought by Candragupta and Parvataka and Cāņakya had the leading part in that. In Act III after verse 24 Cānakya says to Candragupta, &lsquo;we have recently secured the kingdom of the Nandas&rsquo; and in Act IV, 14 Rākşasa himself tells Malayaketu that the Maurya has recently become king. It seems that Candragupta first gained provinces in Northwest India and then secured Magadha. Besides, in Act IV ( before verse five ) Malayaketu says that it was the tenth month after his father&rsquo;s death. That shows that within a few months of Parvataka&rsquo;s death, Candragupta had recovered the throne of Magadha and then engaged in a feigned quarrel with Cánakya about Kaumudimahotsava in the capital. A short time before the false quarrel Malayaketu had left the capital. Hence, according to the Mudrārāksasa, Candragupta came to the throne about 317 B.

<p>the mss. of the Arthaśāstra in the whole of India, particularly in North India, from where so far only a fragment of a ms. of the work has been recovered. The Matsyapurāna (7. 63) contains a story in which the speaker (Indra ), who is suppo sed to have interfered with the womb of Diti that contained 49 foetuses and then made them Maruts, is made to say that he commited a wicked deed following the precepts of Artha sastra.102 This is probably a reference to the Kauţiliya by the author of the Matsya-Purāna in the present state of our knowledge. If this be accepted the Arthaśāstra would have to be pushed back at least some centuries before 250-300 A.D., the probable date of the Matsya, as deinonstrated in H, of Dh. S. Vol. V. pp. 852, 854.</p>
<p>The extant Arthaśāstra itself claims that it is a work of Kautilya. (1) This Sāstra ( book ), that is easy to learn and to understand, that is definite as regards its essence, meaning and words, that is free from prolixity in matter has been com posed by Kautilya; (2) Having gone through all śāstras one after another and having secured (knowledge of) the practice (in such matters ), Kautilya composed these rules about edicts for the sake of kings (II. 10. 63). In the very first sentence of his work he states' this one text-book on the science of polity has been composed mostly by collecting toge ther (the teachings ) of as many treatises as have been establi shed by ancient teachers for securing the acquisition and pro tection of the earth ( realm ); (3) This Sāstra ( text-book ) has been composed by him who, in resentment quickly raised (re-arranged or regenerated ) the science of Politics, the wea pon (to strike down enemies ) and the earth that had fallen into the hands of the Nanda kings.

<p>History of Dharmaśāstra</p>
<p>eighty times and the testimony of comparatively early works and authors like the Mudrārāksasa (5th or 6th century A. D. probably ), Bāna (first half of 7th century A. D. ), the Dasa kumāracarita make a very strong case for holding Kautilya as the author of the work on Arthaśāstra.</p>
<p>At the end of the whole work we find a verse which means &lsquo;on seeing the numerous divergent views of the com mentators on the Sāstras (other text-books on politics ), Vişnugupta himself composed (a work ) containing both sutra and bhāsya &lsquo;.16 This verse is not composed by Visnu gupta but by some one else. It does not mean that the Arthaśāstra has sūtras and bhāsya thereon. It means that the work includes the form and merits of both sūtras and bhāsyas thereon i.e. it is very brief when that quality is requ ired and it contains detailed expositions when they are requi red. He knew that svītras must above all be alpākşara&rsquo; (concise ) and a bhāsya. must explain the meaning of the words of the sutra and add expository material. Vide H. of Dh. Vol. V. p. 1182, notes 1926-27 about the characteristics of sūtra and bhāsya. The aphoristic style (in K. A. ) may be seen in such passages as ). 2. 1-10, 1. 3. 1-15, II. 10. 13-20, III. I. 6-11; the expository style may be seen in VII. 1. 32, V. 5.7 and long sentences in I. 21. 7, VII. 15. 12. etc. Johnston in his</p>
<p>two studies in the Arthaśāstra of Kautilya&rsquo;in JRAS for 1929 (pp. 77-102 ) states that the Larikávatārasūtra was translated into Chinese in 443 A. D., that therefore the main body of the work is not later than 4th century A. D. and that (p. 87) in verses 813–7 the rois are announced in the following order viz. Pāṇini, Kātyāyana, Yājìavalkya, Vālmiki, Masurāksa, Kautilya and Āśvalāyana. Yājñavalkya is most probably the sage of the Brhadāraṇyaka Up. Most of the others belong</p>

<p>1.1. The Arthuśāstra of Kautilya</p>
<p>177</p>
<p>to centuries preceding the Christian era and therefore the name of Kautilya, it seems, was known some centuries before Christ and as most of the names are those of authors, Kauti lya should also lie regarded as an author in this passage.</p>
<p>The Tantråkhyāyika ( the earliest extant version of the Pañcatantra ) which, acc. to Prof. Hertel ( the editor in HOS ), is certainly not later than 300 A.D., pays homage to Canakya the great as one of the expounders of Rījaśāstra ( verse 2). Dr. Jolly (Intro. p. 8 ) wants to put the date of Tantrākhyā yikā one century later (in order to be able to say that Artha śāstra might have been composed about 300 A. D. ) simply on the ground that the collection of tales was not translated into Pahlavi till about 570 A. D. and since the collection of tales agrees closely with the Pahlavi translation. This is not a tenable argument at all. The Pañcatantra had several versions. We do not know what version the Persian translator had before him. He may have translated from a version older than other versions available in India at that time.</p>
<p>Dr. Jolly remarks (on p. 10 of Intro.) that the exhorta tion to soldiers contained in A. (x. 3 ) are quite &lsquo;misleading. There are two verses in the exhortation ( quoted below).104a The first occurs in the extant Parāśarasmrti III. 44, which is comparatively a late smrti as shown below (under Parāśara smrti ). Therefore, the first verse ( if it is a genuine part of the original Arthaśāstra ) might have been borrowed by both A. and Parāśarasınști from some other earlier work. The 2nd verse occurs in the Pratijìā-Yaugaudharayana IV. 3 (one of the so-called Bhūsa plays). There is a sharp cleavage of opinion among Sanskrit scholars as to whether all the numerous plays published as Bhāsa&rsquo;s are the works of the ancient Bhasa who is praised even by Kālidāsa. The pre sent author holds that almost all the published plays attri</p>

<p>buted to Bhāsa are not the works of the ancient Bhāsa. Besi des, the verses yān yajñasanghaih&rsquo; and &lsquo;navam sarāvam&rsquo; are preceded by the words &lsquo;śrnvantu atrabhavantah&rsquo; in the speech of the gātrasevaka in the play. So, he appears to be quoting from another source. Further, the Pratijñā shows acquaintance with Arthaśāstra.165 Besides, the king&rsquo;s exhor tation has iti&rsquo; at the end of X. 3. 27. The passage' vedesva pyanusrüyate &hellip; &hellip; hantavyah' has iti at the end and there is iti at the end of the two verses also. The passages ( x. 3 29-31 ) seem to be later additions and there are three itis instead of one in the supposed exhortation of the king. Therefore, if the two verses occur in the A. they are both quotations and further they may have been taken over by the Parāśara Smrti and the Pratijñā from the Arthaśāstra. Sten Konow in &lsquo;Kautilya Studies&rsquo; (Oslo, 1945, pp. 1-71 )' sees no serious objection to the theory of Bhāsa borrowing from Kautilya' (p. 6). Dr. B. M. Barua in Bliārata-Kaumudi vol. I. pp. 85-119 ( paper styled &lsquo;Arthaśāstra, a blend of old and new&rsquo;) seems to hold that both verses in A. X. 3 are traceable in the plays of Bhūsa (p. 99 ) but he does not condescend to tell his readers in what drama of Bhāsa the first verse “Yan yajñasanghaih' occurs. Dr. Jolly also (Intro. p. 10 ) is vague about these two verses. He does not state from what play the verse · Yan yajñao' is taken. The first verse &lsquo;Yan yajñasanghaih&rsquo; with slight variations is quoted from Visuudharma by Heinädri on Vrata -kõnda vol. II p. 971 ( and as stated above it occurs in Parāśara Smrti also ). It is remarkable that even Keith on r. 491 (in B. C. Law Felicita tion Volume Part I ), vaguely says &lsquo;In A. (X.3) are to be found two verses which apparently are taken from Bhāsa&rsquo;, He never bothered to tell his readers in what play the first verse occurs, just as Dr. Barua and Dr. Jolly do. This is a good example of how sweeping assertions are made by even experienced scholars.</p>

Vide a paper in Calcutta Review for 1924 (October-December ) pp. 339-349. Several scholars have placed Bhisa at the end of the 2nd century A.D. e. g. Sten Konow (in E. Kuhu Presentation vol. 106 ff. and Losny in J. O. I., Baroda ) vol. XIII No. 1 p. 48. This does not affect those who hold that A. belongs to about 300 B. C.</p>
<p>One question about Candragupta may be briefly mention ed here. Puranas vive confused accounts, Matsya ( 272. 26 ) and Vāyu ( 99. 326-27 ) state that the kings after Mahāpadma will be born of Sūdra women. But Vāyu states that Mabă nandi&rsquo;s son from a Südra wife will be Mahāpadma. That means that Caudrayupta was deemed at the time of the Pură plas to be the son of a Ksatriya from a Sūdra wife. The author of the Mudrārāksasa ( whether he belonged to the 5th century A. D. or 6th or later) came long after the Puranas, was per meated by Paurānic lure and therefore he generally uses the word &lsquo;vrsala&rsquo; (which means Śūdra in medieval Sanskrit works ) with reference to Candragupta when speaking of him personally, but in his absence he several times employs merely the word &lsquo;Candragupta&rsquo; (as after 1. 12. 14 ) or Vrsala (just before I. 10). In II. 18 just before approaching king Candra gupta occupying the throne Cânak ya speaks of him as Vrsa lena Vrşeņa rājuam&rsquo; (Vrsala, the best of kings ). There is absolutely no evidence to hold that the kingmaker Cánakya called hiin Vrsala'. It is the dramatist saturated thro ugh and through with laurāņika ideas that Ksatriyas ceased to exist after the Nandas, who applies the word Vrsala to king Candragupta. But it must be emphasized that the Mudrārākşasa also shows that Nandakula was the pitřkula of Candragupta, acc. to Rākşasa ; vide the words &lsquo;Nandakulu manena pitrkulabhūtam ghūtitam&rsquo; (after IV. 12 ) and V. 19</p>
<p>• Mauryossau Svūmiputrah.' It is to be noted that in the Mudrārāksasa Cănakya refers to Caudragupta as Vakogu also (just before I. 19). Frantic efforts have been made by some writers (e. g. by Mr. Goviud Pai in Gode com. vokamos part III pp. 141-150, particularly p. 146, by Mr. K. CASH in I. II. O. Vol. 13, pp. 641-653, and by H. K.

C. ; vide Cambridge History of India, Vol. I. pp. 586, 588). But this is a vain etfort and has not been accepted by many scholars. The Chamberlain&rsquo;s words on the simple fur nishings of Cānukya&rsquo;s abode (Act III before verse 16 ) &lsquo;to him His Majesty Candragupta is a mere Vrsala and rightly so&rsquo; indicate in what sense the word Vrsala was applied to Candragupta by Visakhadatta in the Madriraksasa or was understood by the Chamberlain. It should be noted, however, that the word Vrsala occurs in Rg. X. 34. 11 and is applied to the gambler (&lsquo;so aguer-ante Vrsalah papāda&rsquo;). Here Vrsala seems to mean &lsquo;a miserable or unhappy person&rsquo;. In the Rgveda &lsquo;la&rsquo; is a flixed to some words as indicating endearmentor sympathy e.g. the word sisúla&rsquo; in Rg. X. 78. 6. Several papers have been written on the origin of Candravuptr such as in B.C. Law presentation Vol. pp. 590-610, by Dr. A. Ghosh in I. H. Q. Vol. VI pp. 271-283 ( which rebuts Sülra origin), and by Dr. R. K. Mukerjee in Woolner Commemoration Vol. pp. 93 99. Rīksasa speaks of Candragupta as Mauryaputra in the draina ( Act 11. 7) but Kulahina&rsquo; and in VI. 6 he calls him Vrsala which word in the context means nothing else but Sūdra (his words being gată sighrena srirvisalam-aviniteva vrgali). The difficulty is that we have no contemporary record about the status of Candragupta ( i. e. about 320 B.C.). The views of ancient sages differeil. Vasistha (I. 25) expressly states that some allowed even a dviju to marry a Sūdra woman but without the use of Vedic mantras. Manu III. 13 (latter half) who allowed a Ksatriya to marry a woman of his own varna or a vaiśya or a südra woman condemns in III. 14 such marri ages. It is possible that in the 4th century B. C. a Ksatriya could validly marry a Sūdra woman. Kautilya provides (Arthaśāstra III. 6. 22 ) that in the case of Brāhmunas the şon born of a śūdra wife should receive one-third of the decea sed father&rsquo;s property as his share and u Sapinda as heir shall receive two-thirds' for the purpose of offering the oblations to the deceased.</p>

<p>A learned Astrologer named Vinnugupta is mentioned by Varăbamibira in the Brhaj-jätaka in two places (VII. 7 and XXI. 3). In the first reference is made to the views of Visnu gupta, Devasvāmin and Siddhasena about the length of life a man may enjoy based on certain horoscopic indications. On VII. 8 Utjala, himself a great astrologer, remarks that the two verses ( VII. 7 and 8) do not appear to be Varāhamihi ra&rsquo;s, but Utpala explains thein. Iu XXI. 3 Varāhamihira refers to the view of Visnugupta that Satyācārya held that Aquarius as the rising sign in a man&rsquo;s horoscope does not betoken good throughout that mun&rsquo;s life, while the Yavanas held that it is the Kumblialvádaśamsa at birth that forbodes evil, while Visnugupta challenged both those views. On XXI. 3 the coinmentary of Utpala (as printed ) ascribes the view to two viz., Vişnugupta and Canakya, while the com. on VII. 7 states that Visąugupta&rsquo;s another name was Cånakya. Apart from this confusion probably due to scribes, it has to be said that the astrologer Visnugupta must be entirely different from the author of the Arthaśīstra, since the Arthaśāstra appears to ridicule consulting astrology too much iu IX. 4. 26, which means &lsquo;the ( coveted ) object ( or goal) slips from the foolish person who continuously consults the stars, for the object is (the auspicious or favourable ) constellation; what will stars do&rsquo;? Besides, the system of Rūsis is coin parati vely a late matter in Sanskrit works. In his extensive work Kautilya nowhere refers to Rāśis ( signs of the Zodiac), much less to their influence on human beings. Many renowned persons bear the saine naine. We have Candragupta Maurya as well as two kings of the Gupita dynasty called Candra gupta. Similarly, there may have been two or more Vişnu guptas. Utpala, the commentator of the Bșhajjātaka, com posed a commentary ( vivști ) on the Yogayātră of Varāha mihira. On many passages of the Yoguyātrā Utpala quotes the Arthasāstra as &lsquo;Canakya&rsquo;s ? 188</p>

The Sārā vali of Kalyāna-varman ( Nir. ed. 1928 ), who is earlier than Utpala, but later than Varībamihira, also cites certain astro logical views of Cānakya in Chapter 6. 3 and 47. 45.187 In the latter passage the view that is cited as Visnugupta&rsquo;s in the Byhajjātaka XXI. 3 is cited as Cānakya&rsquo;s. As tbe far famed Arthaśāstra Visnugupta was known under two more names (Canakya and Kautilya ) at least from the 5th or 6th century A. D., the date of the Mudrārāksasa, Vinnugupta the Astrologer is cited also as Cánakya in the Sárávali.</p>
<p>In Kern&rsquo;s edition of the Br. Sam. (II. 4 after prose passages ) a certain verse quoted in the note occurs preceded by the words &lsquo;uktam cácāryavisnnguptena&rsquo;, thereby showing that Varāha quotes a verse of Vinnugupta with acknowledge ment. In the edition of M. M. Sudhakara Dvivedi the sloka is preceded by the commentary (of Utpala ) &ldquo;uktam cīcārya vinnuguptena tathā hyāha ‘apyarnavasya.” 168 As this verse refers to Kūlu as a deity it is probably taken from an astrononical, mathematical and astrological work. Probably, it is the same Visnugupta who is quoted in the Brhajjātaka.</p>
<p>One of the arguments of Dr. Jolly is that many passages of the Arthaśāstra, particularly from the 3rd and 4th adhi karanas on Dharmasthiya and Kantakaśodhana (i. e. roughly civil and criminal law ) recur almost literally in the Smrtis of Yājñvalkya, Nārada, and Manu; and he holds that K. was acquainted with the whole body of Dharmaśāstra literature much as we now have it (M. 12-20). Then he examines Vātsyāyana&rsquo;s Kāmasutra in relation to Arthasāstra and holds that there can hardly be any doubt that the Kāmasutra was deeply intluenced by the Arthuśistra (p. 24 ). That proposi. tion has been accepted by all those who have written on this</p>

<p>subject. But he tacks on another proposition that no long interval of time can have passed between the composition of two such cognate productions&rsquo;. Jacobi does not agree with this at all and the present author also cannot agree with this dictum of Dr. Jolly, for which there is no authority except his own (the dictum that between two coguate productions no lony interval can pass ). And even the date of the Kāmasūtra as 4th century or so( Dr. Jolly&rsquo;s Intro. p. 29 ) may be regarded as later by at least a century or more. As regards comparison with the Smitis, Jolly puts down 33 passages (on pp. 12-17). Out of these 20 are from Yājñavalkyasmộti, only 4 from Nārada, 3 from Manu, two from Visnu and one each from Baudhāyana, Katyayana, Vyāsa. Excepting the passages from Yāj. and Nārada the rest are so few that no scbolar ( who is not already prepossessed in favour of it) will agree that they are enough to hold that Kautilya is the borrower. Dr. Jolly himself had doubts even about Yāj. as he says ( on p. 18 of Intro, ) It is true that some facts seem to point the other way, so that Y. instead of K. (Kautilya ) would have to be regarded as the borrower, either directly or through the medium of a common source&rsquo;. It will be shown later on that the Smrti of Yīj. should be held to be the borrower and presents far greater development of juristic provisions than the work of Kautilya. Keith, without himself examining the data, holds that Dr. Jolly has proved that Yīj. was used by Kautilya and that the evidence is conclusive (at p. 494 ) of Keith&rsquo;s paper in B. C. Law Felicitation Vol. I. pp. 477–495 ). This is like one blind man following another blind man (as said in the Mundakopanişad I. 2. 8 ).</p>
<p>Both Dr. Jolly and Dr. Winternity rely on the Indica of Megasthenes ( while adınitting that both M. and K. agree on many points ) to show that great divergences exist between the Kauţiliya and the account left by Megasthenes. There are great infirmities as regards the work (Indica ) itself. The original work of Megasthenes has not come down. Only fragments of his work are available. McCrindle (on Megas. thenes and Arrian' (1877) states at p. 19 &lsquo;since Strabo, Arrianus and Diodorus have directed their attention to relate nearly the same things, it has resulted that the greatest part of the Indiku haues been completely lost and that of many passages, singularly enough, three epitomes gre extant to which a fourth is added by Plinius&rsquo;. Therefore,</p>
<p>184</p>
<p>Ilistory of Dhurmaślīstra</p>
<p>absence of certain matters in his account cannot be used as an argument at all. How can one know what was contained in what has been lost or was not contained. An argument from silence is not strong and often hall enough but in this case it is much worse (it really is no argument at all). Besides, the period of M&rsquo;s stay in India is uncertain. The Cambridge History of India Vol. I, ( Ancient India ) n. 472 remarks M. resided in India for a considerable time and perhaps on more than one occasion at the court of Pataliputra. The dates of his mission must be later than the campaign of Seleucus (circa 305 B. C.) and earlier than the leath of Candragupta (297 B.C.) but the time is otherwise undetermined. Prof. Winternitz in Cal. Review ( for April-June 1924 ) states on p. 19 that Mega sthenes came to India as ambassador to Candragupta&rsquo;s court in 302 B. C. i. e. he resided in India at the most four years. This means that M. stayed at the court of Pătaliputra only for a few years. There is nothing to show whether he had learnt Sanskrit or any other Indian language like Pali.</p>
<p>We should not and cannot totally brush aside the Mud rārāksasa. Candragupta and Parvatuka, the Naudas and their elimination, Candragupta having employed foreign sol diers and gained large territories in North-West India and even to the West of the Indus river are accepted by almost all scholars. The drama also states that Raksasa, the former minister of the Nandas, was induced by Kautilya to accept the post of chief ininister under Candragupta and he himself retired from the political fielil. One has often to wonder at the ways of some Western scholars of the 20th century. They themselves show that Megasthenes reported matters as exist ing in India which were quite untrue. Dr. Jolly glosses over this in the following words (Intro. p. 38 ) &lsquo;the numerous and glariny discrepancies between Megasthenes and Kauți lys are no doubt to some extent due to the idealising tenden cies of the Greek writer.&rsquo; M. does not speak of the four varņas, the most distingnishing characteristic of Indian Soci ety for several centuries before him, but speaks of seven cla sses in the Indian society of his times (fragment I. p. 40-44 of McCrindle&rsquo;s tr., ed. of 1877 ). M. states that Indians keep no slaves, that agriculturists have a privileged position in that they are exempt from military service and are never to be molested even in times of war, that Indians never took me except at sacrifices, that Indians do not put out money interne</p>

<p>asury (Fragment XXVII B. McCrindle&rsquo;s Tr. ), they have no suits about pledges and deposits ( Fragment XXVII C), that the Indians huve no written laws and are ignorant of writ ing ( Fragment XXVII ), that no private person was allowed to keep a horse or elephant. It is unnecessary to multiply examples. Dr. Jolly himself is constrained to observe (on p. 40 of Intro. ) as may be seen from these examples, the ideali sing tendency in Megasthenes greatly impairs the trustwor thiness of his statements. This is the view of a favourable critic about the positive statements made by M. Prof. A. B. Keith agrees with Dr. Jolly in this appraisal (B. C. Law Feli citation Vol. I. pp. 477–495). To describe the false reports he makes as due to his idealising tendency is a euphemistic way of saying that M. told lies, whatever his object might have been. If this is the state of things in the matter of his positive statements, how can any conclusion be drawn from his silence on this or that point or fact? Prof. A. B. Keith says that M. does not mention by name Kautilya or Canakya (p. 486 of his paper mentioned above) and insinuates that he was non-existent. As a matter of fact the fragments of M. hardly ever mention the name of any prominent Indian indivi dual at the Pātaliputra court or in the country, except that of Sandracottos (king Candragupta ). Keith admits this (p. 487 of the paper noted above). Therefore, non-mention of Kauți lya or Canakya by M, is worthless as an argument. How non-mention is often worthless as an argument may be illu strated by a striking example. Asoka in his numerous inscriptions nowhere mentions his great progenitor Candra gupta (grand&ndash;father of Asoka). But both are mentioned several hundred years later in the inscription (Junagad ) of Rudradāman (in 150 A. D.). Besides, it has been shown above that M. came to India during the last years of Candra gupta&rsquo;s reign. If we accept the story of the Mudrārākşasa, Kautilya or Canakya was connected only with the early years of Candragupta&rsquo;s career. By the time M. came to India, Kautilya might have been living in a hermitage or might have been dead.</p>
<p>It is really surprising how even a veteran and studious scholar like Dr. Jolly cannot have the candidness to say that in view of the unanimous Indian traditions preserved in Sanskrit works (such as the Purānas, Nītisāra, Tantrākhy yikā, Mudrārākşasa, Kādambari, Dasakumāracarita ) and ju</p>
<p>186</p>
<p>History of Dharmaścīstra</p>
<p>Jain and Buddhist literature, it is quite possible that Kautilya may have been a real person and might have had something to do with Candragupta. Not only does he not do this but proceeds to say it might indeed be questioned whether the prime minister of Sandrakottos is not a figure of pure mythology, as he is not mentioned in the Greek reports concerning Sandracottos and as Hemacandra relates very marvellous stories about him.' The first part (about non-men tion by Megasthenes ) has been dealt with above. (pp. 183-4 ) Hemacandra flourished a thousand or more years after Kautilya and, if he gives marvellous stories, the task of the scholar is to separate the chaff from the the solid grains. Marvellous legends about prophets and great men have been told in all religious books, and socalled histories in all lands. Marvellous stories are told in the Pali Jātakas and other works about Gautama Buddha, but nobody denies the existence and mission of Buddha. Dr. Jolly further says that the minister Raksasa ( i. e. the peculiar name only, I hope ) is probably a myth, why should not Kautilya be mythical as well. A king requires a minister or ministers. The Nandas must have had a minister or ministers and one of them might have been dubbed Raksasa for various reasons. Supposing the name was wrongly given, there is nothing mythical about it. Rākşasu occurs not only in the Mudrārākşasa, but it also occurs in the Pañcatantra III ( verse 138 ) p. 65 of Bühler&rsquo;s ed. of 1891 (kūtalekhyair-dhanotsargaiḥ-dūşayet katru-paksajam i pradhānapurusam - yadvad - Vişnuguptena Rākṣasaḥ”). Dr. Jolly, after having written many things (generally one-sided ) becomes aware that it is the contents of the work that matter most and then begins to consider this in a slipshod way on pp. 34-41. On p. 43 Dr. Jolly reverts to the non-mention of Pătaliputra in the Arthaśāstra. As stated above, non-mention would have hardly any bearing on the question of the authorship of an extensive Arthaśāstra. Here also one matter for consideration is as follows: As said above, Kautilya was probably connected with the early career of Candragupta. He therefore wrote the Arthasistra for his king (Narendrārthe' in II. 10). At first, his kingdom was not very large and was unsettled. Therefore, he composed long section on superintendents ( Adhyaksapracūra). Fram that section it appears that he was an experienced adminis trator and not a mere pandit, as Keith said in (JRAS, Maria 1916 at p. 135 ), as Winternitz is pleased to remark (in Cala</p>

</ol>
<p>187</p>
<p>Review 1924 p. 17) and as Dr. Jolly echoes this description (Intro. p. 47). Johnston in JRAS for 1929 p. 101 holds that Kautilya must have been an experienced and practical administrator.</p>
<p>Winternita (Cal. Review for April-June 1924 ) on p. 18 is sceptical about Kautilya&rsquo;s anthorship of the Arthaśāstra chiefly on two grounds ; firstly, the words &lsquo;iti&rsquo; Kautilyah' occur about 80 times and therefore the reference is to a school and not to a single individual. Some Western writers often indulge in categorical statements about matters Indian on scanty data. We have the examples of Baudhāyana (1. of a Srauta and Dharmasītra ), Jaimini (author of Pūrvamimāṁsā sūtra ), Bădarāyane ( of the Vedāntasūtra ), Vātsyāyana (author of Kámasútra ) citing their own names in their works. Võtsyāyana is a gotra name. The famous poet Bāna speaks of his ancestor as &lsquo;babbūva Vātsyāyana-gotrasambha vah&rsquo;. The second ground is the same that Keith advanced in JRAS for 1916 p. 135 viz. that Kautilya means crookedness. How can an author call himself crookedness incarnate ? Vide Cal. Review 1924 p. 18. Here again a little knowledge is a dangerous thing. Kinuțilya is ugotra name. Winternitz appears to have known only one meaning of the word. Just as Bhāradvaja often mentioned in the Arthaśāstra is a gotra name, so is Kautilya (as shown on p. 91 of the first edition ) and as shown above from the grant of Bhaskaravarman of Kamarūpa in the first half of the 7th century A. D. in E. I. vol. 19 pp. 115-7 and 248-250, which only confirms his ancestor&rsquo;s grant. Moreover, the Pravara-sūtra of Baudhayana Srautasūtra (Dr. Caland&rsquo;s ed. ) includes Kautilya in the Yaska group of yotras ( vol. III p. 421). Besides, the Matsya purāna ( Ānan. ed. ) when dealing at length (in chapters 195-202) with gotras and pravaras mentions in chap. 195. 26 ) Kauţili as &amp; gotra name under Bhrguvaṁsa. Therefore, these grounds put forward by Keith and Winternitz are worth nothing.</p>
<p>Another example of easy-going attitudes and want of caution even among some veteran Sanskrit scholars of the West may be mentioned from Dr. Jolly&rsquo;s Intro. to his editia of K. (p. 11). He refers to the fact that Medhătithi on Manu adduces two passages (on VII. 191 and 205 ) from a work spoken of by him as Samánatantra ( which can be traced to the Arthaśāstra X. 5, last verse and VI. 2. 7). Dr. Jolly is so</p>
<p>Rest</p>
<p>188</p>
<p>History of Dharmaśāstra</p>
<p>cocksure that he at once jumps to the conclusion that the Arthasāstra wus surnamed Samānatantra, does not even use the words ‘it is possible and refers in support of his dictum to the words &lsquo;samānam pūrvena&rsquo;, that occur several times in the Arthaśāstra; (vide e.g. I. 11. 10-12, XIV. 1. 26). All that those words mean is the rest need not be expressly stated but that some words or phrases already occurring in de previous sentence or part are to be understood as meant here also.' Samānatantra is a technical term in the Nyāyasūtra I. 1. 27-3.1 and Vātsyāyana-bhāsya. Tantra means &lsquo;siddhānta&rsquo; (tantram pradhāne siddhiinte' as Amarakośa says) i. e. a system of thought or philosophy. A siddhānta may be one of four kinds, viz. (1) Sarvatantra, (2) Pratitantra-siddhānta e. g. certain doymas (such as Prakrti, Purusa in Sārkhya ) are common to Yoga i. e. to two systems (though in other matters they differ as the Yoga system does from Sarikhya) and are Samânatantra. The 3rd is &lsquo;adhikaranasiddhānta&rsquo; and 4th is abhyupayama-siddhanta. The Manusmrti insists on Dharma ( spiritual and moral good ) as the principal matter (or goal) and treats artha ( material good or well-being ) and Kāmu (pleasures of sense ) as inferior and calls upon all to give up Artha and Kāma that are opposed to Dharma (Manu IV: 176). On the other hand the A. ( that is meant for the benefit of rulers (&lsquo;narendrarthe&rsquo; as he says) emphatically states</p>
<p>· Artha alone is supreme, for Dharma and Kāma depend upon Artha' ( I. 7. 6-7). Thus, though Manu and Arthaśāstra deal with many matters that are common to both, the principles and emphasis are different and hence Arthaśāstra may be call ed parallel to ( though not identical with ) Mauusmrti. It may be noted here that the verse Pradipah sarvavidyānām' (Arthao I. 2. 12 ) is quoted by the Vatsyāyana-bhāsya (1.1) only changing the last pāda into vidyoddese prakīrtitā'.</p>
<p>Some Western scholars again and again harp on the point of non-mention as a valid ground for arriving at definite or positive conclusions. Winternitz (in Cal. Review 1924 ) could not avoid the temptation of pressing into service the non mention of Kautilya in the Mahābhārata (p. 28 ). In the Art place, Winternity does not state what date le assigns to the Mahābhārata. Besides, various replies can be given to this useless argument. The great Epic euds upon the note</p>

</ol>
<p>189</p>
<p>Dharma (as the quotations below will show 100 ) just like Manu&rsquo;s exhortations above. Even if Kautilya flourished before the epic there is no compelling reason why the epic should mention a writer with whom it had a fundamental difference. Other possible replies are that Kautilya was a contemporary or flourished slightly later or earlier than the Mahābhārata as we have it.</p>
<p>If one were to write on Western Scholars' frequent use of non-mention* of a person or work by other works or authors as a good reason for coming to positive or definite conclusions, à volume would have to be written. But I must add one more glaring instance of this perverse tendency among certain Western writers (and the instance is very relevant here ). Dr. Jolly (Intro. to A. | 47 ) remarks &lsquo;Patañjali in his Mahā bhāsya refers to the Mauryas and to the Sabhā of Candragupta but is silent about Kautilya&rsquo;. The Mahābhāsya is an exposi tion of the Vārtikas of Kätyāyana an:l indirectly of Pāṇini&rsquo;s sútras; it is quite wrong to suppose that it is a general work on Sanskrit authors and Literature or a thesaurus of all literary works in Sanskrit and the naines of their authors (up to Patañjali&rsquo;s time). If soine historical facts are stated in the Mahābhāsya they are relevant for the purpose of expla ining Panini&rsquo;s sūtras and their application. To take first the reference to the Mauryas: It occurs in the Mahābhāsya 170 on</p>

The frequent reliance on 10n-inention by Jolly and Winternitz tempts me to refor to Prof. A. H. Sayce who rebukes the European sobolars and especially Germans for their fonduess for treating negative evidence as of great value in putting forward theories which broke down on further search ( vide on Aryan problem</p>

<p>Pān. V. 3. 99 (Jivikārthe cãpanye). This says that the affix Kun ( ka ) is not applied to images of Gods that are meant to be sold, but that are installed for gaining livelihood; e. g. an image of Siva is called Siva if it is not meant for being sold but is established for affording a living to the Devalakas (priests of the idol); while if an image of Siva be meant for sale, it would be designated Sivaka, but would not be applica ble to idols established by Maurya kings for collecting gold or cash (from the offerings placed before the images ). Besi des, the plural. Mauryaiḥ&rsquo;is used. That is most important. There were vine or ten Maurya kings, who ruled in all for 137 years ( vide p. 171 above). Therefore, reference is not to Can dragupta at all but to his descendants after Asoka, the last of whom was ultimately liquidated by senāni Pusyamitra and whose doings Patañjali might have personally known or heard because he was very near in time. There is no occasion or necessity to bring in Kautilya here. Then a word must be said about Candraguptasabhā. On Vārtika 7 of Pån. I. 1. 68 (read with Pan. II. 4. 23 gabhā räjämanusyapūrvā ), we get the neuter gender for the compounds &lsquo;inasabham iśvarasa bham&rsquo;, but we have Rājasa bhā (not rāja sabham ), Pusyami trasabhā and Caudraguptasabhā) (and not Candraguptasa bham &amp;c.). Here the question is one of pure grammar. It may be noticed that Patañjali mentions the Sabhā of the founder of the Mauryas and also of the destroyer of that dynasty (viz. Pusyamitra). Asoka was the greatest of the Mauryas, but owing to his Buddhist proclivities he was probably persona non grata with Patañjali. Following the logic of Dr. Jolly, Asokasabhā not being mentioned in Patañjali it could have been argued that Asoka did not exist or at least there was no Aśokasabhā, His Inscriptions and Buddhist works</p>

For example, the Arthasāstra uses it in that sense e. g. in &lsquo;धान्यषड्भागं पण्यदशभागं चास्य भागधेयं 99CP Aig: 11 I. 13. 6; eget feug CHEATRisa gafa&rsquo; 1. 19. 12; Bileturgauit: qTÁST: 299: 1 III. 16. 39 ; HETTETAGETESTETE TOU. सुवर्णसूक्ष्मवस्त्रादीनां स्थूलकद्रव्याणां द्विशतावरः पञ्चशतपरो मध्यमः साहस que: I III, 17, 9.

<p>vouch for his existence. Well then, the Purānas, Jain and Buddhist sources vouch for the existence of Kautilya and the A. itself proclaims that it is Kautilya&rsquo;s work; besides, writers from the third century A. D. at least onwards mention him. Why should not all Western scholars agree on this probabi lity at least ? Many of the treat Kautilya as if he were in the dock and regard themselves as advocates for the prosecu tion and eager to condemn and annihilate him. I can gauge or surmise the motives of some at least of them. But it is not necessary for my purpose here to dwell on them.</p>
<p>A. B. Keith (in J. R. A. S. for 1916 pp. 130-137) states that it is perfectly possible that the Arthaśāstra is an early work and may be assigned to the 1st century B. C. while its material is older (1), 137 ). He, however, held that the verse</p>
<p>Yena sästram ca sastram ca' (at the end i. e. in XV. 1. 73 ) is unlike a statesman and very like the product of a follower who desired to extol his master. This is purely one man&rsquo;s subjective idea about what a person should have done (who flourished two thousand years before him). Jacobi ( who assigns Kautilya to about 300 B. C. in I. A. Vol. 53 pp. 128 136 ) and others do not accept Keith&rsquo;s remark at all. Keith (on p. 136 of JRAS for 1916 ) says that Kautilya means fal sehood. This is not accurate. Kuțila means &lsquo;bent or croo ked&rsquo; as the Amarakośa says and as the Vārtika &lsquo;Anavanakau tilyayor-iti vaktavyam&rsquo; on Pan. I. 3. 66 and Patañjali indicates (Kielhorn&rsquo;s ed. Vol. I. p. 290 ). In 1945, however, Keith appears to have changed even his first response to the publi cation of Kautilya&rsquo;s work and published a paper (in B. C. Law Presentation Vol. I. pp. 477–196 ) remarkable for its acrid and supercilious tone, where he observes there is no trace of a commanding intellect in the actual work before us (p. 486 ) and that Arthaśästra does not exhibit any qualities of the type of Frederick the great, Madhavācārya, Todarmal, Richelieu, Warren Hastings, Woodrow Wilson, Lenin and Churchill.' Dr. Jolly also (Intro. p. 33 ) sings the same tune, when he writes this however appears to be certain that his work is the outcome of a long period of literary activity in the field of polity rather than the production of a creative genius, another reason for not fixing its age limit too high</p>
<p>Many scholars have contributed papers showing the indebtedness of Kūlidāsa, Bhavabhūti and others to the Arthaśāstra. For example, vide Kunhan Raja Felicitation192</p>
<p>History of Dharmaśāstra</p>
<p>Vol. pp. 48-54 and Proceedings of the 13th All India Oriental Conference, part 2 pp. 102-108 ( Dr. Raghavan ) for Kalidasa&rsquo;s indebtedness to Kautilya). No scholar (except Dr. Pran Nath ) puts the Arthaśāstra later than the 3rd century A. D. and most scholars place Kalidasa between 350 to 450 A. D. Therefore, beyond serving to check or corroborate the text of A. such articles are not of importance in this section and so these matters need not be dwelt upon here.</p>
<p>From comparatively ancient times Cánakya alias Kautilya or Vinnugupta has been credited with the composi tion of a work on Arthashstra. The Kimandakiyanitishram pays a glowing tribute of praise to Visnugupta, who, single handed, brought about the downfall of Nanda, bestowed the earth on Candragupta and distilled from the ocean of Artha śāstra the quintessence, his work on politics. Kāmandaka further tells us that he looked upon Visnugupta as his guru.172 The Tantrākhyāyikā (H. O. S. vol. 14) which is certainly not later than 300 A. D. pays homage to Chnakya the Great as one of the authors of treatises on Politics. 179 Dandin in his Dasakumāracarita ( section VIII, p. 131, 2nd edition B. S. Series) says that the teacher Visnugupta com. pressed Dandanīti for the sake of the Maurya king into six thousand slokas and quotes passages from Cīnakya.174 Bana associates the work of Kautilya with harsh and cruel expedients. The Pañcatantra identifies Cānakya and Vişnu gupta and speaks of Canakya as the author of Arthaśāstra</p>

<li>The Arthaśāstra of Kautilya</li>
</ol>
<p>193</p>
<p>(vide part I. p. 2 ed. by Kielhorn, part II. p. 65 and part III. 50 ed. by Bühler). Kautilya figures very largely in the Purānas (vide Pargiter&rsquo;s Dynasties of the Kali age' pp. 69-70 and Visnupurāna 4. 24. 26-28 ). He has a prominent place in the Bộbatkathā of Gunādhya as appears from the works of Kşemendra and Somadeva. The Mìchhakatika (I. 39, B. S. series ) refers to Cánakya. The Mudrārāksasa identifies Cānakya and Kautilya and suggests the derivation of the latter name from Kutila'(crooked ). Some of the above items of information are supported by the personal references contained in the Arthaśāstra itself. At the end of the first adhikaraña Kautilya is said to be the author of the Sāstra and at the end of the 10th chapter of the second adhikarana Kautilya is said to have laid down the rules for royal edicts for the sake of the king. 175 The last verse170 tells us that he, who impatiently wrested the earth from the Nanrla king, composed the work and after the colophon a verse tell us that, seeing the differing interpretations of bhâsyakáras on the Arthaśāstra, Visnu gupta himself composed the sūtra and the bhāsya.</p>
<p>Kautilya gives his own definition of Arthaśāstra in Adhikarana XV. 1. It means &lsquo;means of the subsistence of men are artha ( wealth ) i. e. the earth (land ) inhabited by men.&rsquo; The science which is the means of gaining and pro tecting that earth is the science of Artha (Politics ) (Manu syāņām vsttir-arthah manusyavatī bhumirityarthah ; tasyāh přthivyā lābhapālanopāyah sāstram-arthaśāstram-iti ). The Kauţiliya appears to employ the word Nītiśāstra in the sense of Arthaśāstra in V. 4. 3 (anātmavãn hi nītiśāstradvesād anarthyasamyogadva prāpyãpi mahad-aiśvaryam na bhavati.

<p>The first question that arises for consideration is the authenticity of the work, that is, the question whether it can be the work of the famous ininister of Candragupta Maurya, who was a contemporary of Alexander, and who must there fore have flourished about 320 B. C. This question very larg ely depends upon the age of the work. But other considera tions, more or less of a subjective character and depending upon the absence of certain things from the Kauţiliya, must be dealt with first. Jolly, Keith and Winternitz hold that the extant Kauţiliya is not the work of the Maurya minister. One argument, viz. that a person like Cīņakya who had to build a vast empire such as that of Candragupta and who was bent down with the cares of the empire could not have found time to write such a work, may be brushed aside as entirely futile, being a purely subjective argument. Soine persons may say that he could have found time, just as Sāyana and Mädhava could find in later days, to write such a work in tbe midst of all cares, while others may deny the possibility of such a thing. Similarly, most of the arguments from the silence of the Kautiliya are also quite unconvincing and lead to no certain and universally acceptable conclusion. The non-mention of Pāțaliputra or of the empire of Candragupta is of very little use in deciding the question of the authenticity of the work. The argument of Stein and Winternitz that in Megasthenes' account of India no great person named Cānakya or Kautilya appears and that the former&rsquo;s account of the condition of India does not tally with that presented by the Kautiliya is of very little weight. We have no means for finding what proficiency Megasthenes had acquired in the languages of India so as to be able to hold conversation with all sorts and conditions of men. Besides, it is well known that Megasthenes' writings have been handed down in a fragmentary state and that he often spins his own yarns. Megasthenes declares the Indians to be unacquainted with writing. But no Western scholar would now subscribe to the view that writing was unknown in India about 320 B. C. Dr. Jolly himself has to remark that the idealising tendency in Megasthenes greatly impairs the trustworthiness of his statements (p. 40, Introduction to Kanţiliya). This question of the authenticity of the working bound up with the question whether it can be the work of an individual author or whether it is the product of a sabrusy</p>

<p>Hillebrandt vehemently argues that it is the product of a school and Jacobi as vehemently repudiates that hypothesis. The great stumbling block according to many scholars in the way of regarding Kautilya as the author of the work is the fact that the views of Kautilya are cited by name about 80 times in the work itself, almost always in opposition to the views of other teachers. But there is nothing specially to be wondered at in this. In order to avoid looking too egoistic, ancient authors generally put their own views in the third person as said by early writers like Medhātithi and Visva rūpa.177 It has to be admitted that the first person singular also is used by ancient writers, though rarely. 178 Jacobi (I. A. for 1918 p. 188 ) and Keith are both wrong in thinking that the view of Rautilya is criticized by Bhäradvāja in V. 6. Kautilya states his position first and then mentions the view of a predecessor.179 Dr. Jolly (Intro. to Kautilya p. 44 ) is wrong in his explanation of Apadesa (in XV. 21 ).180 That word is applied to passages which mean &lsquo;this or that author says this or that&rsquo;and the Kauţiliya cites froin his own work a case of the statement of varions views on a certain point. These words do not at all indicate that according to the Arthaśāstra Kautilya was a stranger. Apadeśa is one of the 32 tantrayuktis ( devices or patterns of the tantra i. e. the system propounded in the work). It should be noticed that all the 32 tantrayuktis are exemplified from the Kauţiliya itself and in illustrating the word &lsquo;apadeśa&rsquo; in Adhikarana 15 the author quotes an example (out of many in the work itself from its first adhikarana. Apadeśa seems to mean ' a statement or declaration.&rsquo; The word Apadesa occurs also in IV. 8. 2. The words of Dr. Jolly (Intro. p. 44 ) are rather misleading. He says &lsquo;the numerous references to opinions of K. in the body of the work are in the Tantrayukti chapter explained as coming under the head of A padeśa&rsquo;. K. is exem</p>

<p>plifying the various devices ( yuktis ) that have to be emplo. yed in expounding his system. The three opinions including his own have already been stated. There are many examples of apadeśc in the work apart from the one mentioned in XV (as on I. 8, I. 17. 4-22, II. 7. 11-15, VIII, 1, VIII. 3). Keith thinks (J. R. A. S. 1916 p. 135) that as Kautilya is derived from Kutila, an author will not cite his own views under such an epithet. It is not unlikely that Canakya acquired the epithet Kautilya on account of his methods in dealing with the Nandas and that as he did so from no purely selfish motives but for ridding the country of such tyrants as the Nandas are represented to have been, he might have come to relish the name given to him by the people. It has to be noted in this connection that many of the writers quoted in the Kauțiliya bear nicknames (such as Piśuna, Vāta vyādhi, Kaunapadanta ). This leads to the question as to whether the name is Kautilya or Kautalya. Hillebraudt seems to imply that all mss. employ the first form, while Pandit T. Ganapatisastri says his mss. support the latter form though in the first few pages he prints Kautilya. Mss. of the Kādam bari, the Pañcatantra and other works support the form Kautilya and the Mudrārākşaga does the same by pointedly hinting at the etymology. A com. on the Kimandakiyani tisára styles the Kauţiliya as Kutalabhāsya and Kutala is said to be a gotra. The form Kautalya is said to occur in an insc ription at Ganesar in Dholka dated Vikrama Samvat 1291 (i. e. 1234-35 A. D.). Vide Indian Historical Quarterly vol. I. p. 786. It is very difficult to decide between the rival claims of the two forms, but it appears that the form of the name, Kautalya, is due to a later attempt to solve the diffi culty of an author parading his views as those of a man picknamed “crooked.&rdquo; Whether Kutala or Kautalya was known as a gotra rși in ancient times is extremely doubtful. Neither the Asvalāyana-srauta-sútra (Uttarsaţka, 6th chap., 10th Kandika ) nor the Apastamba-srauta-sútra (24. 5-10 ) mentions Kutala among the several gotra groups. In later works on gotras, we find the name in several forms. In the Pravaradarpaņa of Kamalūkara Kautali is said to be one of the Jāmadagnya-Vatsa group of the Bhrgus (p. 156 edited by P. Chentsalrao, Mysore ) and Kautilya is assigned to the Yaska group of the Bhrgus ( p. 158). The Pravaramajani enumerates the Kautilyas (p. 32, of the edition by P. Chentsatu</p>

</ol>
<p>197</p>
<p>rao, Mysore) among the Yaska group of the Bhrgus, also among the Saradvanta group of the Gautamas, a branch of the Angirasas (p. 161) and Kautili as one of the Bhrgus (p. 42).</p>
<p>In connection with the Arthasāstra of K. the following questions arise ( and arguments on them become mixed up ). I. Was there a person called Kautilya or Canakya, who helped king Candragupta and was his minister; II. Did he write a work on Polity; III, Was the work in prose or verse or both; IV. Is the extant Arthaśāstra substantially the same work that was originally written by Cănakya or Kautilya ; V. Is Vişnugupta mentioned in a verse occurring at the end in some mss. the same as Kautilya or Cīnakya or different.</p>
<p>The preceding pages contain answers to some of these questions. On the available evidence there is hardly any doubt that Kautilya and Canakya are names of the same person and that he helped Candragupta in the early part of his career (reply to question I ); Kautilya or Canakya was the author of the extant Arthaśāstra as stated in the work itself and in the Tantrākhyāyiks, Kādambari and Daśakumaracarita (reply to question II ). The work was in prose with a verse or verses at the end of each chapter and sometimes in the middle also. This will be elaborated a little later ( reply to question III ). The extant work is substantially the same as originally written, but it is likely that some matter was interpolated later. Some portions dropped out owing to its unpopularity ( evidenced by Bāna ) and the great lack of mys. of the work ; same possible interpolations lave been pointed out in several places ( reply to Question IV); Vinnugupta is the name given at Nāmakaraşıı and Visnugupta, Cinakya and Kautilya are the names of the same person (reply to V). It has been shown that the Nitisāra ascribes the work to Vişnugupta, the Tantrākhyāyikā speaks of Canakya as the author of a nipa sāstru, the Kādambarī ascribes the Såstra to Kautilya, the Dasakumāracarita identities Visnugupita und Canakya and the Mudrārāksasa gives the three names as those of the same person.</p>
<p>The Puranas are mainly concerned with the periodic creation and destruction of the world, the royal dynastiesynd their doings (i. e. with history ) and holy places, penances, vratas, contents of the Vedas, their auxiliary lores i Vedāngas ), the composition and number of the Purāṇasand</p>

<p>History of Dharmaśāstra</p>
<p>Dharmaśāstra matters ( and much of this in a prophetic vein ) and they hardly ever refer to secular works except in compara tively later Purānas. There is no wonder, therefore, that even when some of them refer to Kautilya as instrumental in uprooting the Nandas and placing a strong and capable ruler like Candragupta on the Magadha throne ( that is history, Vamsa and Vamśānucarita ), they are generally silent about the names and authors of secular works like the Artha sāstra and the works of poets and dramatists like Bhāsa and Kālidāsa.</p>
<p>Before proceding to discuss the age of the Kauţiliya, it is advisable to say a few words on the form, style and contents of the work. The work is divided into 15 adhikaranas, 150 chapters, 180 topics and contains 6000 slokas (i. e. units of 32 letters ). The work is in prose interspersed with a few verses. Each chapter has at the end at least one verse and sometimes more; for example, at the end of VII. 3 there are 15 verses, 14 at the end of VII. 18, 12 at the end of VIII. 5,8 at the end of VII. 6 and VII. 13. Even in the middle of some chapters occur some verses, excluding mantras e. g. in I. 8 (one), I. 15 ( 2 ), II. 10 (12), II. 24 (5), V. 6 (1), VII. 5 (9), VII. 6 (1), VII. 13(2), X. 3(2), XIII. 4 (1), XIV. 2 ( ). There are about 375 verses in all (excluding mantras, but including some obvious quotations ). Almost all verses are in the Anustubh metre; there are 2 classical Upajātis in II. 9 (32-33), 5 Upajūtis iu II. 10, one Puspitāgră in II. 12 (10); in all eight verses that are not Anusţubh. Some scholars are inclined to regard the chapter on Sāsanas as a later interpola tion, principally on the ground of the number of verses in it that are not Avustubhs. This is wrong. It we look to the Mahābhāsya that quotes Kārikūs and verses in metres other than Anustubh, we shall have to hold that long before 150 B.C. (the generally accepted date of the Mahābhāsya) many classical metres had been developed; for example, kārikaīs in Āryä metre (on Pan. I. 1. 57 and on I. 2. 51, on Pän. VI. 1. 77 and VII. 1. 78 there are Kārikās in Indravajrã, on 1. 4. 109 there is Vidyun mālā, there is Vasantatilaka on Vārtika I on Pan. III. 2. 26 :( Kielhorn&rsquo;s ed. Vol. II. p. 102 ), there is a Rucirā on p. 409 vol. III. There are such quotations as asidvitiyos nusasāra Pândavam&rsquo; ( Kielhorn vol. I. p. 426 on II. 2. 2 which is a Vam usthapada. The largest number of venter occurs in Adhikarana VII (89 verses ), then come AdhikarAfrika</p>

<p>II ( 71 verses) and Adhikarana I (with 46 ). The smallest Adhikarana is XI (with less than three printed pages and has only one verse) and the longest Adhikarana is the second dealing with Adhyaksapracāra and covering nearly one-fourth of the whole work. In the absence of early works on Arthaśästra prior to Kautilya it is almost impossible to say. how many of the verses in K. are borrowed or how many are his own composition. There can be no doubt that some of these verses are his own composition e. g. the two verses (16-17) at the end of I. 10, where respectively the views of the ācāryas and of Kautilya (iti Kautilya-darśanam ) are set forth must he held to be his own. It may be said that some verses are quotations. For example, the verse &lsquo;nāsya guhyam pare&rsquo; at end of 1. 15, connected with his own word (kurvatasca&rsquo;) in the last sentence, is a quotation. But a difficulty arises that this verse is almost the same as Manu VII. 105 and similar to Santi 140-24. Similarly, the verse &lsquo;Samvatsarena patati &amp;c.&rsquo; (Arthu. IV. 7. 28 ) is almost the same as Sánti 165. 37, Manu XI, 180, Baud. Dh. S. II. 1. 62, Vasistha I. 22 and Visnu Dh. S. 35. 3-5 first half). In this case it is difficult to say who borrows from whom, but it is probable that Kauțilya borrowed from Santiparva or Baud. A half verse181 in A. III. 14. 27 (anāhitāgnih satagur-ayajvā oa sahasraguh) is found in Manu XI. 14, Sāntiparva 165. 9 and in Gaut. Dh. S. 18. 26-27 ), all three in another connec tion ). A. III. 7.1-2 (in prose) have almost the same idea and words as Manu 8. 332.183 It is noteworthy that they</p>

<p>are introduced with the words &lsquo;apiha ślaukau bhavatah&rsquo; and follow a quotation from or summary of a Vedic passage. Twelve verses in VII. 9 are introduced with the words &lsquo;tatrai tad bhavati&rsquo;and may be quotations. A few of the verses bear a close resemblance to verses of other works; e. g. the verse</p>
<p>přstaḥ priyahitam brīyāt&rsquo; (in V. 4 ) which is very similar to Manu. 4. 138. In some cases he connects verses with his own words, e. g. the words &lsquo;kurvatasca&rsquo; with &lsquo;nāsya guh yam&rsquo; (at the end of I. 15 ) and the last verse of II. 25. The style of the Kautiliya is simple and direct. It is not concise like that of the Vedānta or Vyakarana sūtras. It resembles the dharmasūtras of Gautama, Hārita and Sarkha-Likhita, but is not an archaic as that of Apastamba. According to the commentaries the several headings of the prakaranas are sutras and the contents of them the bhāsya ( vide Nayacandrikā pp. 137, 143-44 &amp;c., erlited hy Dr. Jolly ). It abounds in numerous technical and rare terms. It is generally in accordance with Panini&rsquo;s grammar, though such un-Páninean words as pápişthatama&rsquo; (in VII, 11 ) rarely occur. It employs the word &lsquo;avyaya&rsquo; in the masculine (II. 10. 19 ), while Pāṇini ( I. 1. 37 employs &lsquo;avyayam&rsquo;.</p>
<p>A. employs such gerunds as &lsquo;nistūrayitva&rsquo; in IV. 12. 38, pravāsayitvā&rsquo;in XII. 4.4 and abhimantrayitvā&rsquo; in XIV. 3.45.</p>
<p>The whole work on account of its careful arrangement of topics and unity of design impresses one as the product of a single brilliant mind. Like a modern work it gives an exhaus tive table of contents, divides the work into fifteen Adhikar ņas, these into chapters and prakaranas and often refers to its own remarks in a preceding or following chapter e. g. in I. 12. 17 K. refers to spies spoken of in Kantakasodhana (i. e. in IV 4. 3 ), in VII. 3. 6. ( ābaliyasam vā yogam-ātişthet ) he refers to Adhikarana XII. which is labelled · Ābaliyasam &lsquo;; On XIII. 1. 14 (tena parapakşam-utsähayet-yathoktam purastāt ) he refers to I. 14. 6 ff; in XII. 2. 8-9 (yathā sanghavștte ca vyakhy@tam, yogavāmane ca yaduktam, atmaraksitake &amp;c. ) be refers to XI. 1, XIII. 2 and I. 21 respectively. The 15th Adhikarana (on Tantrayuktis ) contains 32 references to previous passages. The Kauțiliya sheds such valuable light on the social, economic, political and religious life of antrent</p>

<p>It would be interesting to say a few words separately on the chapter about judicial administration. Dr. Jolly has collected together the passages of the Kauţiliya on judicial administrtion that bear a very close resemblance to the several works on ancient Indian Law (vide Z. 1). M. G. vol. 67, pp. 51-90). It will be seen there from that there is the greatest correspondence between the Kauţiliya and Yajñavalkya. It is</p>

It should be noticed that there are indications in the A. itself that we must tak. &lsquo;status as ono word. For example, in VII. 3. 36 we have 31 Tactata: puffet Palett F : ( these three kinds of treaties by the woak king should be entered into as practices for the weakor king&rsquo;. The termination 3 is added here to 317 TUE as one word.

<p>no doubt true that many passages from Manu and Nārada agree closely with those of the Kauţiliya but not to the same extent as those of Yājñavalkya. A few striking examples are quoted below. 184 The question then arises whether there is borrowing and if so who the borrower is. The agreement in phraseology is so close that it must be regarded as a case of borrowing and in my opinion it is the Yājñavalkyasmộti that borrows. The reasons are many. Yājžavalkya represents on numerous points of law a very great advance upon the doctrines of Kautilya. Kautilya does not contain distinct directions upon the four stages of a law suit (plaint, reply, proof and judgment) nor upon the threefold aspects of proof (documents, witnesses, prescription ). Yājñavalkya goes into all these matters. The Kautilīya does uot recognise the widow or mother as heir to a sonless man; Yājňavalkya does 80. Kautilya does not mention the bandhus as heirs; he hardly says anything about re-union.185 The Kautiliya divides the stri dhana of a woman dying during her husband&rsquo;s lifetime among her sons and daughters, while Yāj. prefers the daughters to the song.188 Kautilya differs from all Dharmaśāstra authors (including Yāj. ) in allowing a divorce on account of mutual hatred between husband and wife (III. 3. 16 &lsquo;parasparam</p>

<p>History of Dhurmaśāstra</p>
<p>dveşīn-muksaḥ). Kautilya ignores the widow or mother of a person as an heir, while Ynj. II, 135 recognises them as heirs if one dies without a son or daughter and the extant Manu smrti also prescribes that the mother of a person dying child less would succeed as heir to him and if the mother also be dead the father&rsquo;s mother would inherit (IX. 217). It is not necessary to multiply exainples. It goes without saying that Yājña valkya represents a far too advanced stage of juristic principles than the Kauțiliya and so must be later than the latter by several centuries. The Kauțiliya agrees very closely with Manu also, but considerations of space prevent me from going into the points of agreement. There are however numerous fundamental points on which Manu aud the Kauțiliya disagree.</p>
<p>Kautilya allows niyogu even in the case of Brāhmanas (last verse of III. 6 and at the end of I. 17 about kings ). Manu first speaks of Niyou and then condemns it ( vide 9. 57-63 and 9. 64-68 ). As Brhaspati refers to this fact in Manu&rsquo;s work,187 it appears that the passages condemning. niyorja were put in probably earlier than the first centuries : of the Christian era. Though Kautilya speaks of almost the same 18 titles as those in Manu (8.4-7) almost under the same names, there is a slight difference. Manu has no such title ds Prakirnuku. Kautilya speaks of upanidhi and extends the same rules to Niksepu, while Manu speaks of the title as Nikpepa. The ancient dharma-sútras do not give the technical names of the eighteen titles of law, though some of them do occur therein. Vák páruşya and Dangapūrusya occur in G. Dh. S. (12. 1 ) und Vas. ( 17. 61 ). Baud. seems to have known the term &lsquo;Strisajigrahana&rsquo; ( Dh. S. II. 2. 54 ); steya occurs in all. Gautama speaks of nidhi (Dh. S. 12. 39). Manu positively says ( 9. 155 ) that the son of any member of the first three varnies from a Sūdra woman does not inherit his father&rsquo;s wealth (though the preceding verses 151-154 seem to lay down different rules ), while Kautilya allows such a son a share when there are sons born to a Brahmana from wives of higher castes or one third when he has no other sons (III. 6. 22). Manu expressly mentions the mother and paternal: grandmother is heirs (9. 217 ), while Kautilya appears to</p>

<p>iguore them. Manu prohibits the remarriage of widows (V. 1.61-165 ), while Kautilya allows not only widows to remarry, but also wives whose husbands have not been heard of for a year or more according to circumstances (III. 4. 37-38 ). Kautilya allows a wife to desert her husband, if the latter is of a bad character, has become a traitor to the king, endangers her life or has become an outcaste or impotent188 ( last verse of III. 2). Kautilya further seems to have allowed divorce which is unknown to any other known lawgiver, but he bases it only on the ground of mutual hatred and says that a marriage in the approved forms cannot be dissolved 180 (III. 3. 19). Mapu is very harsh upon gam blers and asks the king to suppress gambling and banish gamblers (9. 221-224 ), while Kuuţilya only brings gam bling under the control of the King for the purpose of detecting thieves &amp;c. (III. 20.2 ). Munu first allows Brah inana to inarry even i Süra woman and then condemos such a thing (III. 13-19), while Kautilya does not condemn such upions. These divergences and others lead us to conclude that the Kauţiliya is much older than the extant Manusmrti, which is in many matters carried away by puritanic zeal, while its older portion is nore in harmony with the spirit of the Kauțiliya Therefore, the Kauţiliya is long anterior to the time when the extant Manusišti took its present form. The Kauțiliya refers to the opinion of the Mänavas in five places. Two of the views ascribed to the Mänavas by Kauti liya are the same as those which Kūmaudaka (II. 3 and XI. 67 ) ascribes to Manu. According to the Mānavas, the vidyās to be studied by a prince were three, viz. trayī, vārtā and dandunīti, what is called anviksiki being but a branch of trayi; and the council of ministers was to consist of twelve. The Manusmști (7. 43 ) appears to regard the vidyās as four und lays down (7.54 ) that the Council should consist of deyen or eight sucivas. Bühler und others on account of this difference in the views of the Mānavas and the Manusmrti thought that kuuţilya was referring to the Māna vadharma sutra. In my humble opinion the evidence for the existence</p>

<p>TIMO 1 VUGDI</p>
<p>of a Mânavadharmasutra is p</p>
<p>as detailed above in section 13. From the references to Svāyambhuva Manu and Prācetasa Manu contained in the Mahābhārata, parti cularly in the Sānti and Anušāsana parvans it appears that there were two works in verse on dharma, and politics attri buted to these two or there was one work containing both. These works were subsequently recast as the Manusmrti. It is therefore that some difference is noticed between the views ascribed to the Māravas and the extant Manusmrti. Besides, there is no real conflict in the matter of villyās. The Manusmrti does not positively say that the vidyas are four and not three; it simply says from whom truyi and the other three are to be learnt (VII. 43). The Manusmrti (in 7. 60 ) allows more ministers than seven or eight. It is possible that in recasting several changes were made. The third opinion of the Mānavas quoted by Kautilya is about the fine to be imposed upon officers of the State occasioning loss of revenue (II. 7). The other two views of the Mūnavas quoted are concerned with the fine to be imposed on false witnesses and for forcible seizure of jewels:00 &amp;c. It must be admitted that in the extant Manusmrti there is nothing exactly correspon ding with these views. But from this fact no one conclusion alone can be drawn. There may be a mistake in quoting, or there may be interpolations, it may be that some of the verses in the original Manusmrti have dropped out or that the Kautilya is quoting not the Manusmrti itself, but the views of works based on or explanatory of Manu. It is noteworthy that Bșhaspatill contains a verse very similar to the views on the Bāhasa attributed to the Mānavas. We shall see below that Bșhaspati&rsquo;s work was more or less a supplement of Manu. The only authors or schools, besides the Mänavas, cited by name in the dharmasthiya section are the Bárhaspatyas and the Aušanasas. It is remarkable that the well-known and ancient Dharmasūtrakāras like Gautama, Apastamba, Baudhāyana, Vasiştha, Hārīta are nowhere quoted by name. It is note worthy that in the dharmasthiya section the Kauțiliya several</p>

<p>times quotes the viewes of ācāryas and of some others under the word &ldquo;apare&rdquo;. Some of these views correspond closely with the discussions in the ancient dharmasūtras. One of these is the question as to whom the child belongs to the begetter or to him on whose wife it is begotten. Kautilya first quotes the view of the acāryas that it belongs to the husband of the mother of the child, then says that some hold that it belongs to the begetter, while Kautilya holds that it belongs to both.193 It is to be noted here that both Baud. and Ap. say that according to the Brāhmana texts the sons belong to the begetter, while Vasistha says there is a dispute on the point, both views being supported by ancient authorities. Gautama speaks of both views and at last (18. 13&rdquo; dvayorvā” ) seems to come to the same conclusion as Kautilya. It is not unli kely that Kautilya has in mind this discussion in the Dharma sūtras and also in Manu (9. 48-54 where the view is that the child belongs to the husband of the woman). Some of the other views attributed to acāryas are that a woman could visit the houses of her husband&rsquo;s relations, of prosperous men, of village headmen, of female ascetics &amp;c. (III. 4); that very poor men could divide even waterpots at a partition (III. 5); that the master who did not employ a servant ready to work according to agreement had to pay the wages agreed upon as if the work had been finished (compare Visnn V. 157 ); he who forcibly confined a man or woman or who by force relea sed another from imprisonment was to be fined between 500 and 1000 ( III. 17.10); that disputes of a remote date shall not be complained of and that he who is the first to complain wins, since one runs (to court ) as one cannot bear the pain (III. 19. 19 ); that in a complaint by one gambler against another, the successful party has to pay the fine called pūrvasāhasa and the defeated party the fine called madhya sāhasa ( III. 20.3 ).</p>
<p>The foregoing discussion about the dharmasthiya section shows that in the sphere of the administration of justice, Kautilya is far in advance of the dharmasūtras of Gautama,</p>

<p>The Adhyaksapracăra (adbikarana II ) contains much original matter, thongh adhyaksas were known before Pāṇini and although Manu VII. 81 provides that the king should appoint various clever adhyaksas, no work gave an elaborate treatment of the work they were to do. Similarly, though Manu (IX. 252-53 ) cmphasizes that the king should sup press kantukas, there is hardly any treatment in Manu of that topic. All matters dealt with in some chapters of this section IV do not deal with criminal matters but rather un social or reprehensible matters. K. is conscious of this in IV. I. 65. The king should prevent from troubling the country those who are really thieves but are not known as thieves such as traders, artisans, actors, mendicauts, jugglers and others. This shows that Kant. was a very capable administrator. He mentions about twenty-five departments and the adhyaksas over them. The most important adhyaksa was the Samāhartr (Revenue Commissioner) in II. 6 and 35. Other important officers were the Prailestis (Magistrates ) (IV. 1). Three of them were of the rank of ministers and were charged with the work of suppressing criminals or undesirable persons. A. provides (in IV. 9. 1) that the Samăhartr and the magistrates (pradeştāra! ) should check the heads of departments and their subordinates and in (IV. 3. 16 ) provides for the punishment by fines of judges ( Dharmasthas ) if they threaten, upbraid or drive away a litigant or are guilty of other misconduct (IV. 9. 13-16 ). K. also provides for the punishment of magistrates in IV. 9. 20. K. shows great originality and makes elaborate provisions for the several departments of the State and his section on Adhyaksas occupies a little less than one&ndash;fourth of the whole work. It should be noted that from II. 10 p. 48 up to III. 3. p. 101 and again from III. 20. p. 129 to V. 5. p. 160, K. makes no reference to divergent views at all.</p>

<p>we can only say that the Kautiliya is certainly not later than the 2nd century A. D. , since Kamandaka, the Tantrākhyāyik. and Bāna, speak of it with admiration. No one claims it to be earlier than 300 B. C. Even Keith who assigns it a late date and cannot place it earlier than 100 B. C. at the most has to admit (J. R. A. S. 1916, p. 135 ) that for a precise date we have no real ground.</p>
<p>The Kauţiliya quotes five schools by name: Mänavāḥ (five times ), Bärhaspatyāḥ ( 6 times ), Aušanasāḥ ( 7 times ), Pārāśarāh ( 4 times ), Ambhiyāḥ (once ); and the following individual authors; Kätyāyana (1), Kiñjalka (1), Kauna padanta ( 4 ), Ghotakamukha (1), ( Dirgha ) Cārāyana (1), Parāśara ( 2 ), Pisuna ( 6 ), Piśunaputra (1), Bāhudantiputra (1), Bhāradvāja (7, once as Kanika Bhäradvāja ), Vāta vyādhi ( 5 ), Viśālāksa ( 6). He either differs from all these authors or they differ from each other in all the places where they are cited. All the individual authors (except Bāhu dantiputra ) that are cited only once occur in V. 5. 11 on the same page. Kautilya quotes the views of ācāryas about 53 times and in all cases (except in VII. 11. 37-38 ) be negatives their opinions. The word &lsquo;Acāryāḥ&rsquo; means all or the great majority of the ancient authors on a sāstra collectively. Vide the author&rsquo;s paper on the meaning of Ācāryāḥ&rsquo; in BORI. Silver Jubilee Vol. 1942, pp. 206-213. Kautilya is cited 83 times against some author or other (except in three cases viz. in III. 4. 36, VII. 15. 11, XIII. 4. 5). It is clear from A. that a difference is made by it between schools ( such as the Mānaväh &amp;c ) and individual authors. It has been shown above that works on Arthasāstra composed by Brhaspati and Usanas existed before the Maha bhārata and the Dronaparva (7. 1) speaks of &lsquo;Mānavi Artha vidyā&rsquo;. If the work had been the product of a school, then instead of &lsquo;iti Kautilyah&rsquo; we would have had the words&rsquo;iti Kauţiliyāh&rsquo;or. Kautilyāḥ &lsquo;. Besides, those learned scholars ( like Dr. Jolly, Keith and Winternity ) who assign the work to the 3rd century A.D. are quite unable to point to any person who could have been the author of the work in the 3rd century A. D. There is no Canakya or Kautilya who is known from inscriptions or literary works or traditions even as having flourished in the 3rd century A. D. and having been a great writer on Arthasastra. The Arthaśåstra employs the word &lsquo;apare also in III. 7. 2 and the word &lsquo;eke&rsquo; twice in IX, 28 and 30.</p>
<p>Bhandark</p>
<p>210</p>
<p>History of Dharmaśāstra</p>
<p>The Kāmasūtra of Vätsyäyana mentions a Ghotakmukha and a Cārāyana. Whether they are identical with the authors cited by Kautilya is extremely doubtful. The Mahābhārata mentions among writers on Dandaniti the following who occur in the Kauţiliya also :-Brhaspati, Manu, Bhāradvāja, Visā lāksa, Sukra ( the same as Usanas ) and Indra (probably Kautilya’s Bāhudantiputra ), whose abridgment of Brahma&rsquo;s work is called Bāhudantaka in the Sāntiparva (chap. 59 ).</p>
<p>According to the Nayacandrikā, Pisuna, Bhāradvāja, Kauna padanta and Vāta vyâdhi stand for Nārada, Dronācārya, Bhisma and Uddhava respectively (pp. 73, 69, 74, 91 ).</p>
<p>The Mahābhārata mentions other writers on politics, viz. Gauraśiras, Kaśyapa, Utathya, Vāmadeva, Vasuhoma, Käman daka (Santiparva 123. 11 ) and a few others which are not found in the Kauțiliya.</p>
<p>The Kautiliya knows the four Vedas, the charms and incantations of the Atharvan, the six angas, includes under Itihāsa, Puranas, Dharmaśāstra and Arthasastra; it knows the Sankhya, Yoga and Lokāyata 103 schools of thought. It mentions Mauhurtikas, Kārtantikas ( astrologers ), Jupiter and Venus. It refers to dhñtuśāstra ( Metallurgy ). Sanskrit was the official language and in the Sāsanādhikāra it men tions such gunas of composition as mädhurya, audārya, spastatva, which show the beginnings of the Alamkāra-sāstra. There is nothing to wonder at in this. In the second century A. D. we have the inscription of Rudradāman, which enu merates the gunas of KĀvya. The Kauçiliya does not mention edicts on stone or copper. It refers to Vaisikakalājñāna ( II. 27. 28). The Kauţiliya closely agrees with the Kamasutra in several respects, and the two works contain several iden tical passages ( such as the list of kings that fell victims to intrigues and about trivarga). Keith argues from this that the Kautiliya and the Kámasútra are not separated by a long interval and that it is a late work. Dr. Jolly also is of the same opinion (p. 24 Intro. to Arthaśāstra ). If the Kama sutra held up the Kautiliya as its model, then the two works would certainly look very much alike. There are points of</p>

<p>difference between the two works, e. y. they differ in their attitude towards flesh-eating and the Kamasutra speaks of planetary influence and lagna, while the Kautiliya is silent on these points and only condemns in general terms the con sulting of stars. We must note here that Kauţiliya (IX. 4.26) speaks of consulting nalcștrcs, which were known from the earliest Vedic period and some of which were looked upon as auspicious for sacrificial purposes even in the Satapatha Brāh mana ( 8. B. E. vol. 44, pp. 1-2) and the Srauta and Gșhya sūtras. The Kauţiliya follows the Vedānga Jyotisa in the system of a yugu of five saṁvatsaras, in prescribing two intercalary months in a yua and in saying that at the end of one uyana the variation between the length of the day or the night comes to six muhurtas ( vide 11. 20. 66). Keith argues that the slokas in the Kautiliya are more classical than even those of the Rāmāyana and that it contains correct Tristubh stanzas which are wanting in the Brhaddevată (a work of the 4th century B. C. ). But this argument can produce no impression on those scholars who ascribe the Rāmāyaṇa to the 5th century B. C or earlier. Nor is the date of the Brhad devată beyond the pale of discussion. There is no consensus of opinion among scholars as to the exact time when classical slokas and correct Tristubhs first came into vogue. It is to be noted that the Kauţiliya defines pada as varnasanghāta and not as in Pāṇini ( sup-tinantar padam ).</p>
<p>Among the countries and peoples frequently mentioned by Kautilya, several are interesting. He speaks of silks from the land of the Cinas104 and blankets from Nepal. Keith says that the name Cina, being derived from the Thsin dynasty in China ( which began its rule in 247 B. C. ), would show that the Kauțiliya could not have been composed about 300 B. C. No one however knows how the word Cina was derived and besides as Keith admits the passage may be an interpola tion.</p>
<p>Many scholars have misunderstood the word &lsquo;cina&rsquo; occurring in II. 11. 114&rsquo;tayā kauśeyam cīna pattāśca cinabhū mijā vyākhyātāh&rsquo;. Cina&rsquo; here does not mean what is modern China at all.

That is, the Cinas spoken of in this passage were in modern Assam. Besides, this one sentence in A. might have been interpolated in later times. Moreover, kings are named after countries ( e. y. a king of Magadha is called Magadha ), but a king hardly ever gives a name to the country he rules at least in historic times, Besides, in Udyogaparva ( 86. 10 ) Dhrtarästra is made to say that he wonld present to Krsna</p>

<p>i</p>
<p>As regards the home of Kautilya or Canakya there is some divergence of views. Jolly (in Intro. p. 43 ) remarks that &lsquo;the geographical horizon of the author on the whole points to a southern rather than to a northern home&rsquo; and for supporting this opinion he relies only on two circumstances, viz. (1) the only known inss. of the Arthaśāstra exist in the South and ( 2 ) in the discussion of trade routes ( VII. 12 ) the route to the South is declared to be preferable because the commodities of shells, diamonds, gems, pearls and gold are more abundant there. 196 Both these grounds are worthless for supporting Jolly&rsquo;s conclusion about Kautilya&rsquo;s home. Northwest and North India were harassed for many centuries before and after the Christian era by frequent invasions of Persians, Greeks, Sakas, Hūnas and others; therefore the copying of mss. was neglected. Mss. of many works of authors from North India were found not in North India but only in South India. The Väkyapadiya has been quoted above (). 76 n. 102 c. ) to show that the Mahābhāsya was restored from mss. that existed in the South. Vide above. The mss. of the Kävyā. lankära of Bhāmala (&amp; Kashmirian ), were found in the south and were published first in the South. The 2nd ground is based on a misconception. Daksinäpatha ordinarily means &lsquo;the Southern countries&rsquo; (generally south of the Narmadā ).</p>

Rhys Davids in &lsquo;Buddhist India&rsquo; (p. 22 ) states that the name occurs in one of the oldest Buddhist documents viz. Suttanipāta 976.

<p>Daksinapathaganini&rsquo;. But in the above passage in the Kauţiliya the word Daksināpatha is not used in the sense of a region, but probably in the sense of trade route to the south&rsquo;. Kautilya preferred Daksinapatha, not because it was his home, but because it yielded valuable commodities and more taxes for the State treasury and because his main thesis was that in polity&rsquo; artha'( material good, wealth ) is the most impor tant matter. It has already been stated above that he was from Gāndhāra ( a3 he mentions that country in the matter of the defamation of a country ).

Then he refers to their preparation. The Madhu kind of wine is produced from the juice of grapes and their designations are derived from the place of origin such as Käpiśāyana and Härahüraka.

<p>compounded with its ingredients (as in Madhumaireya ). Intoxicants from grape juice were made in many parts of India. Since Kautilya meptions only two places on the north west of India, it is reasonable to infer that he came from those parts. Jayaswal in JBORS, vol. II, pp. 79 ( note ) identifies Härahüraka with Arachosia ( for which see above p. 172 ). In. The geography of Kautilya&rsquo; by Harihar Trivedi in I. C. vol.

Cunningham (in Ancient Geography of India&rsquo;, ed. of 1924 on p. 22 ) says that Pliny mentions the district of Kapisene, its ancient capital being Kapisa, which was des troyed by Cyrus and Ptolemy places the town of Kapisa amongst the Paropamisadie &lsquo;north of Cabul&rsquo;.</p>
<p>In Lama Taranath&rsquo;s · History of Buddhisın' translated into German by A. Schiefner (St. Petersburg, 1869 ) some reports about Canakya are given. Taranath was born in 1575 A. D. (1573 A. D. acc. to some ) and wrote his history in 1608. Portions of the German translation of his work appear in I. A. Vol. IV. pp. 101-104 and 361-66. He takes the work of Ksemendrabhadra ( a Pandit of Magadha ) as his basis and also relies on two other works viz. Buddhapurāna by Pandita Indradatta of a Ksatriya family, in which all events up to four Sena kings are recorded (i. e. this work must have been later than 1200 A, D, at least ) and another ancient history by a brāhmana Pandita Bhataghati about the succession of teachers. It must be remembered that Taranath wrote 1900 years or at least 1300 years after the supposed dates of Cănakya. On p. 1010 n of H. of Dh. Vol. V it has been indicated how Taranath&rsquo;s account about Sarikarācārya and Kumārila is of a confused character. In Chap. XVIII of Schiefner&rsquo;s transla tion ( on p. 88 ) Canakya is said to have been the minister of Bindusāra, son of Candragupta, who reigned for 35 years. In I. A. IV on p. 362 ( from Taranath ) it is said that Asoka was succeeded by his grandson Vigatāśoka, whose son Nanda ruled for 29 years and the latter&rsquo;s son was Mahāpadma ; that is, Mahāpadma is stated here to be the son of the great-grand son of Asoka. It would be noticed how this recital of Asoka&rsquo;s descendants is altogether confused and is worth little.</p>

<p>pointed out above) that the army of Candragupta when he conquered Punjab and North-West India was made up of Yavanas and others guided by Canakya. The Mahāvarsa ( V. 16-17 ) says that Candragupta was a Maurya and a Ksatriya and that the Brāhmana Cūnakya, an irate person, killed the 9th Nanda and crowned Candragupta as king of the whole of Jambudvipa ( i. e. India ). The commentary on that work called · Vamsatthappakāsini ( edited by Dr. Mala lasekhara Vol. I. pp. 180-81 ) states that Canakya was the son of a Brāhmana from Takbasilā, was māyāvin, had studied Nīti (statecraft). These two epithets probably bave the Arthaśāstra in view. The fact that Kautilya states (in A. II. 20. 37-38 ) that the difference between the longest and sbortest day is 12 ghatikas clearly indicates that he was a resident of the extreme North-west of India. Vide H. of Dh. Vol. V part I, p. 538 n 785,</p>
<p>On the question of the age and authenticity of the Kautiliya a vast literature has accumulated and it would not be possible to review the whole in a brief manner. It is not possible at present to state whether scholars will ever be unanimous on these two points.</p>
<p>There are three principal groups of writers on the question of the age of the Kauţiliya. First come those who hold that the Kauțiliya is.a genuine work of Canakya or Kautilya, that minister of Candragupta Maurya. Candragupta was king between about 321 B. C. to 297 R. C. It has been stated above that Kautilya was associated with the earlier career of Candragupta. Therefore, the Arthasāstra should be held to have been composed between 320 to 300 B. C. or thereabout. When a scholar says that A. belongs to the 4th century B. C. he does not mean that it is to be placed between 399 B. C. to 300 B. C. We shall have to assign the work to a short period in that century i. e. between about 320-300 B. C. or rather between 320-310 B. C. This date for the Arthasāstra is accepted by Jacobi ( in I. A. Vol. 47 pp. 157-161, 187-195 and I. A. 53. pp. 128-136 and 141-144 ), by Dr. Shamasastri in his Prefaces to his editions of 1909 and 1919 and in S. K. Aiyangar Presentation Vol. (pp. 122-6), and by Fleet, Breloer, Meyer, Jayaswal, M. M. Ganapatigastri, Dr. D. R, Bhandarkan (ABORI Vol. VII. pp. 65-84), N. N. Law, Sten Konow and several others. The present author holds that this is the correct view and he will state a little later some of the com</p>
<p>216</p>
<p>llistory of Dharmašiīstra</p>
<p>pelling reasons for the same. The 2nd group of scholars assigns the Kauţiliya to about 300 A. D. and the principal representatives of this group are Dr. Jolly (Intro. pp. 1-47 of the edition of A. ), Keith (in JRAS 1916 pp. 130–137 and B. C. Law Presentation Vol. I. pp. 477-495 ), Winternitz (Cal. Review, April-June, 1924, pp. 1-28 ). The main argu ments of this group have been dealt with above and rejected. No further reference need be made to their arguments. There is a third non-descript group of scholars who do not accept either 300 B. C. or 300 A. D. as the date of the Kauţiliya, but put it at different dates between 300 B. C. and 300 A. D. Reference need be made only to a few of them. Dr. B. M. Barua in Bhāratakaumudi (in honour of Prof. R. K. Mookerji ) contributes an article called the Arthasāstra, blend of old and new' pp. 85-119. His conclusion is that the extant Arthaśāstra is anterior to the Junagad Inscription of Rudra dáman (150 A. D. ) and may be placed near the beginning of the Christian era. He himself points out (on pp. 102-104) how certain phrases are common to the Kautiliya and the Asoka Inscriptions. He has already been criticized above about the two verses quoted in the king&rsquo;s exhortation to his soldiers (pp. 177-8 above). He unnecessarily parades certain facts e. g. on p. 101 he refers to thirty-four or more Tantrayuktis in Vägbhața, Caraka and Susruta* (all medical writers ). It is</p>

In the Rgvoin the word &lsquo;bhişak&rsquo; (physician) occurs frequently (as in I. 116, 10, II. 33, 4, IX, 112-1, X, 97, 6). The word &ldquo;O;ndhi' occurs dozeng of times in the Rgveda and so does the word &lsquo;bhoaja! Ry.

<p>difficult to understand what conclusions one can draw from this taken with the fact of the Arthaśāstra containing 32 Tantrayuktis. It may easily be said by any scholar that the medical writers named by Dr. Barua borrowed from the Arthaśāstra, but that has hardly any bearing on the date of 300 B.C. An author may borrow passages or definitions from a work which was composed several hundred years before him. Dr. Bose agrees that Susruta is the borrower (p. 439 ) but avers ( without assigning any reason ) that K. preceded him by only a few decades. This is nothing but a mere guess or assertion. On Naipālakam (in A. II. 11. 100 ) he observes that even in the digvijaya of Arjuna in the Sabhāparva ( Mahābhārata ) the name of Nepāla does not occur and therefore the Arthaśāstra is a late work (pp. 114-115 ). Scholars should always be careful and cautious, parti cularly in dealing with the Mahābhārata, because it is a vast work and because there are several recensions of it. But in this particular case, unfortunately for Dr. Barua, Nepāla is mentioned in the digvijaya of Karna in the Vanaparva ( chap. 254. 7 isa Haimavatikan jitvā karam sarvān-ada payat i Nepālavişuye ye ca rājānas-tān-avājayat II).</p>
<p>E. H. Johnston ( in J. R. A. S. for 1929 pp. 78-102, at p. 89 and JRAS 1939 at p. 225 ) says that the Artha śāstra cannot be placed as late as 200 A. D. and that it is not likely to be earlier than the beginning of the Christian era. Similarly, Dr. Atindranath Bose in I. C. Vol. IV. ( for April 1938 p. 435 ) favours a post-Christian date for the Artha sästra. He is really guilty of making an absurd use of the urgumentum ex silentio. In the Questions of Milinda' (S. B. E. Vol. 36 on . p. 147 ) there is a single sentence as follows · And further there was Bhaddasala the soldier in</p>

In Sabhāparvan 11. 25 A yurveda is spoken of as fastänga and Sinti 28. 47 speaks of poople suffering from the effocts of old age oven though they know rasayanas and made use of them. These references show that centuries before the Christian ora lodian medicine had made great advances. Asoka&rsquo;s 2nd Rock Ediot states that the emporor had made provision for the modight treatment ( cikitsa ) of mou and beasts ( cattlo &amp;c.) and had caused to be supplied medicinal herbs suitable for men and animals ando had ordered the plantidy of such herbs where they were Hot available,</p>

<p>the royal family of Nanda and he waged war against king Candragupta'. That sentence is preceded by the cruelties practised at that time in the words I have seen ten men expiating their crimes by being impaled alive and thirty, even forty, hundreds, thousands'. No Purāņa or other ancient work speaks of Cāņakya or Kautilya as a general; all that is claimed for him at the most is encouragement to others, and the use of unscrupulous means and stratayems. The sentence in the Milinda-praśna is not a history of a campign. It is only a stray sentence in a dialogue between a king and a Buddhist teacher. But the writer in I. C. IV waxes eloquent by saying that had K. been the man behind Candragupta, the historians of Alexander who wrote not solely on Megasthenes' record, but utilized plenty of material now lost to us like Justin, Curtius, Arrian, Strabo and Plutarch would not have dismissed him with silent indifference while naming Candra gupta and Nanda. The war between Nanda and Candra gupta was fought about 320 B. C. Megasthenes came to the court of Candragupta later than 305 B. C. and yet he men tions no person of the Pataliputra court or of the whole of India except Sandracottog. Some of the historians that Dr. Bose mentions (in I. C. Vol. IV ) flourished about 100 A. D. (i. e. four hundred years after the war between Nanda and Candragupta ). How could they, living thousands of miles away from Patna, name any person that flourished four hundred years before them, when Megasthenes, an ambassador at the Patna Court, mentioned no eminent Indian by name except Sandracottos? He speaks of the Sangha of the Vrsnis (1.6) and the Sreņis (corporations ) of Ksatriyas in the countries of Kambhoja and Surāstra that lived by vārtā ( agriculture and trade ) and by the profession of fighting and the corporations of the Licchcivika, Vrjika, Mallaka, Madraka, Kukura, and the Kurupancālas that live on the title &lsquo;rāja&rsquo; (XI.1). Some of these tribes such as the Licchavis, Vrjis ( Vajjis in Pāli) and Mallas are well-known from ancient Buddhist works. What is meant by &lsquo;rājaśabdopajivinaḥ&rsquo; is not quite clear. It probably means that the organisation of the Licchavis and others was on democratic lines and that there was very keen competition for the honour of being elected the chief or president of those corporations, the latte being designated &lsquo;rāja&rsquo;.197 The Nayacandrikā explains tbati 107 In the Jātakas (Fausbüll vol, I., p. 504 and vol.

<p>they bear the proud designation of &lsquo;rāja&rsquo; but are penniless (and so can be easily employed in military service as mercena ries). We are told that the breed of horses from Kambhoja, Sindhu, Āratta and Vanāyu was the best and that Băblika, Päpeya, Sauvīra and Taitala breeds were of middle quality. The Kautiliya speaks of Mleccha tribes and tells us that among them one&rsquo;s own childern could be sold or pledged without incurring punishment (III. 13 ).</p>
<p>There is hardly any distinctive reference to things Budd. hist except one passage (III. 20 ) where a fine of one hundred ( paņas ) is prescribed for him who invited to dinners in honour of gods or Manes a Buddhist ( Säkya), an Ajivaka, &amp; śüdra ascetic. 108 This shows that the work was written at a time when Buddhism was yet not a wide-spread religion and had not secured an honourable place annong the people. The Ajiviku was a well-known sect in ancient India, said to have been founded by Makkhali Gosūla. Asoka donated caves to the Ajivikas on Barabar hill (vide Inscriptions of Asoka ed. by Hultzsch, 1925 p. 181 ) when he had been anointed twelve years as king and his grandson Dasaratha ( 215 B. C.) donated to them caves at Näyárjuni hill. The 7th pillar Edict of Asoka refers to Brähmanas, Ājivikas and Nirgranthas (E. I. Vol. 20, pp. 270-272 ). Rhys Davids in &lsquo;Buddhist India ' ( ed. of 1950 ) p. 87 holds that the Ajivika order was older than the Buddhist. Makkhali Gosāla, the leader of the sect, was at first a disciple of Mahāvīra but later left him. The Vāyupurana ( 69. 281–289 ) paints a dark picture about the Ajivas (or-vikas ). Kautilya says that weights should be made of iron or of stones from Magadha and Mekala ( country near the sources of the Narmadā ).100</p>
<p>The verse ( of A. I. 6. 12 ) saying that Jāmadagnya i. e: Parasurūma, that had brought under control the senses by giving up the group of six enemies ( viz. kāma, lobha &amp;c ) enjoyed the earth for a long time and so did Ambarışa, son of Nabhāga. On this Jacobi remarks ( I. A. vol. 53 at p. 144 ) that the Mahābhārata and the Balakāņda of the Rāmāyana know nothing that Jämadagnya ever was a king. The verse</p>

<p>in question does not use any word for &lsquo;king&rsquo;. The intended meaning is not that Paraśurāma actually ruled over the earth for a long time as king. The Mahābhārata in several places states that Parasurama wrested the earth from the Ksatriyas as many as 21 times, performed sacrifices and donated the earth to Kaśyapa and the prests ( vide Vanaparva, 117. 9-11)</p>

The idea is that he gave up lobha ( greed ) which is the root of all sins ( lobhamülāni pāpāni ) and, though the whole earth was his, he donated it to others several times. For doing this he must have lived long. Ambarışa also is mentioned in the Aśvamedhikaparva (chap. 31 ) as reciting gãthâs ( 7-12 ) expressing the idea that Lobha was the greatest enemy. Ambarīsa is mentioned as a great king in the Rgveda 1. 100. 17. Paraśurāma is one of the seven or eight long-lived (cirajivin ) personages. Vide H. of Dh. Vol. II, p. 648 and Vol. V. p. 208n ).</p>
<p>! Jolly (Intro. pp. 34-35 ) refers to knowledge of alchemy and metallurgy exhibited by the Kauțiliya, the political and economic institutions and social conditions described in A. and states that they are in a far more advanced stage than those recorded or alluded to by Megasthenes. It has been shown above what worth is to be attached to the few fray ments of Megasthenes. The columns erected by Aśoka about twentytwo hundred years ago are witnesses of the great attainments of the Indians of those days in chemical processes, polish, metals and even in these days modern chemists have not been able to show how that polish was made. Dr. Stein in his work on · Kautilya and Megasthenes&rsquo; ( Wien, 1922) compares the information in the fragments of M. with that in the Kautiliya and on the slender basis of the fragments of Megasthenes ( whom Strabo called &amp; liar ) arrives at the conclusion that the items of difference overweigh the coin cidences both in number and importance. He also draws attention to the word &lsquo;Surungă'200 mentioned several times in the A. and holds that it was probably derived from syrinx&rsquo;,</p>

<p>&amp; Greek word often occurring in the description of sieges in Polybius and Diodorus. Winternitz (in I. H. Q. I pp. 429 432 ) agrees with Dr. Stein.</p>
<p>In the 19th century and the first quarter of 20th century Western scholars clung to the theory that science, philosophy and arts began in Greece and that other nations merely bor rowed them from the Greeks. That bubble of Greek origi nality in many matters has been pricked. The Greeks them selves borrowed many things from Babylon and Egypt; vide H. of Dh. Vol. V. pp. 482, 522n, 549, 594, 700 for authorities. Now Prof. Neugebauer (JAOS. Vol. 61 pp. 213-215 ) avers that Babylonian methods of calculation together with Greek went to India. There is no doubt that there was cultural intercourse between Babylon and the Punjab as far back as the third millenium B. C. and the intercourse was by land. Peacocks, rice and Indian sandlewood were known in Pale stine under their Tamil names in the Hebrew Chronicles of Genesis and Kings. Vide H. of Dh. Vol. V. part I pp. 598-600 and notes 893-900 for further information. The Hittite and Mitanni records ( of about 1400 B. C. ) show that Vedic gods ( such as Indra, Varuna, Mitra and Nāsatya ) were in their pantheon and Prof. A. H. Sayce ( in Pavry Commemoration Vol. pp. 399-402 ) draws attention to the fact that Hittite numerals are Sanskrit and bolds that in the 15th century B. C. people that lived in Mesopotamia and Asia Minor spoke Sanskrit. Therefore, the word Suruga might have been taken from Mesopotamia ( or from Egypt ) long before the Greeks had anything to do with India. Unless one can prove that a word like Surunga is not found at any time in docu ments from Mesopotamia, Egypt or other very ancient coun tries, to assert that Surunga was borrowed from Greek Syrinx is merely to jump to a conclusion without any proper evidence on the mere vround of similarity of letters or sounds.</p>
<p>The third question raised above (p). 197 ) is whether the Arthaśāstra was originally entirely in prose or entirely in verse or in mixed prose and verse as at present. Most scholars are agreed that originally it was substantially the same as pow (i. e. largely in prose, with a verse or&rsquo;a few verses at the end of chapters (and rarely in the midst of chapter ). Prof. D. R. Bhandarkar (in ABORI. Vol. VI. pp. 65-84 ), while placing the Kauțiliya at 300 B.C., hota that the Kautiliya was originally in verse and was later222</p>
<p>History of Dharmaśāstra</p>
<p>turned into prose about the time of Dandin (on pp. 77–84 ). He refers to the words of Dandin (quoted above p. 165 )&lsquo;iyam &hellip; sarkşiptă &lsquo;( which means &lsquo;this whole science of Dandaniti was abridged in six thousand ślokas&rsquo;). He holds that that meaning of Sloka ( unit of 32 syllables ) is most modern. Here he is entirely wrong. Those words of Dandin are taken from the present text of the Kauţiliya itself ( I. 1. 18 ) Sapanc. sadadhyāyasatam sat-ślokasahasrāṇīti ). Besides, a similar sense of sloka is found in the Kāmasūtra quoted below. There fore, the word sloka meant also a unit of 32 syllables at least in the 3rd century A. D. He makes sweeping assertions for which he adduces very little evidence viz. &lsquo;No reasonable doubt is permissible that there was a time when the Artha śāstra of K. was wholly composed in verses&rsquo; and again all the writers prior to Dandin who quote from Arthaśāstra quote verses&rsquo; and he cites a few verses. This statement is an argument in a circle as he presumes that the verses are quoted from the supposed Arthaśāstra in verse. Now the verge (Samvatsarena patati&rsquo; in A. IV. 7. 28 ) occurs in Manu XI. 180 (last pāda differing ), Sānti 165. 37, Baud. Db. S. (II. 1. 62, Mysore Govt. edition, 1907) and Vas. I. 22 ( preceded by the words &lsquo;athăpyudāharanti ) as shown above on p. 98. So in Vas. it is a quotation, but the question is from whom. Manu (in its original form ) might have contained it and Baud. Dh. S. is an old Dharmasūtra. And therefore A. might have taken it from Baud. or from Sāntiparva or some earlier source. Similarly, the verse Pradipah sarva-&lsquo;in Vātsyāyanabhāsya might have been taken in the 4th century A. D. by that work from the present Arthaśāstra ( that verse is A. I. 2. 12 ) at the end of the chapter. There were no printed books in ancient and medieval India. Verses can be easily remern bered as compared to prose passages. Verses in the extant A. are few viz. only about 375 in the whole of it, while the prose passages occupy at least 250 printed pages. The verses * Dharmaśca&rsquo; and &lsquo;tatra satye&rsquo; ( occurring in A. III. 1. 39-40 ) also occur in Nārada I. 10-11. Nárada might have taken them from the extant Arthagāstra or from the original Manu-smrti of which Nārada is said by tradition to be gute versiou. Nárada is not assigned to an earlier date than a A. D. But how does this yo to establish that the whole of Nie</p>

A similar verse is cited as Katya yava&rsquo;s by the Vivādaratnākara. And that verse refers to Bhrgu, the supposed author of the extant Manusmrti. Prof. D. R. Bhandarkar&rsquo;s is merely a fantastic assertion without any solid evidence whatever. Prof. D. R. Bhandarkar is not able to state who could have transformed thousands of verses into prose while keeping a few hundred intact, exactly when and for what purpose. Why should one who undertook such a tremendous task have done it incognito ?</p>
<p>Another scholar who holds the theory that the A. was originally all in verse is Dr. Pran Nath (in I. A. Vol. 60 pp. 109-112, 121-123 anıl 171-174 ). He cites only 28 passa ges to show that they could have been originally in verse but were transformed; he cites only ten passages which become verses by the addition or removal of a word or two. The ordinary Anustubh metre is so simple that any prose passage can be easily turned into verse, since each pārta has eight syllables of which the majority (viz. five ) may be either short or long. Dr. Pran Nath is singular in assigning A. D. 484-510 A. D. as the date of the A. when all others assign it to 300 B. C. to 300 A. D. only. He need not be taken seri ously and may be left alone.</p>
<p>About the personal history of Kautilya or Cānakya we know very little. That he was an inhabitant of Gāndhāra has been pointed out above and if we trust the traditions on which the plot of the Mudrāräksasa is based, it may be said that he lived a very simple life and had no personal ambitions. He was a man of extensive reading and had studied parti cularly all the works composed before him on Arthaśāstra, as is expressly declared in the very first sentence. He had seen the ravages (both physical and mental) caused by foreign in vasions of India and his great ambition seems to have been to see that the whole of what he calls Cakravartiksetra should be under the strong but benevolent rule of a noble and capable king. And he composed his great work as he says (II. 10. 63) 201 देशस्य जातेः सङ्कस्य धर्मो ग्रामस्य यो भृगुः । उदितः स्यात्स तेनैव दायधर्म</p>

<p>for the guidance of his favourite king ( and for all kings who wanted to be powerful ). He appears to have been a brāhmana of the traditional type. In I. 3 he speaks of the four Vedas and also of Itihāga veda, the six vedārgas, the four varnas and āśramas, the peculiar dharmas of brāhmanas ( study of Veda, performing secrifices, making gifts, teaching Veda, officiating at sacrifices and receiving religious gifts ), of Ksatriyas, vaisyas and sūdras, of householders, brahmacārin, forest hermit and sannyāsin and he prescribes for all men cominon duties ( in I. 3. 13 ) viz. ahiṁsā, truthfulness, purity, freedom from malice, compassion and forbearance (sarvesām-ahimsā, saucam, anasüyānrsamsyam, ksama ca ). Compare Manu X. 03 and Gaut. 8. 24. And he adds in I. 3. 14-17 the perfor mance of one&rsquo;s special duties leads to heaven and to ever lasting bliss.2012 On transgressing ( dharma ) people ( who do So ) would be destroyed on account of the confusion ( about duties and castes ). Therefore, the king should not allow people to transgress their duties, since by enforcing adherence ( of people ) to their respective duties he, (the king ) finds joy in this world as well as after death; and again (in 1.4.16) he says &lsquo;the people of the four varnas and belonging to their respective āśramas ( the four stages of life ), when protected i. e. controlled by the king with the rod (of punishment ) and devoted to their proper duties and occupations, keep to the paths proper for them. He believed in the four goals of human beings (Purusārthas ) viz. dharma, artha, kāma and moksa ; allows to the king the option (in 1. 7. 4) to devote himself to the first three equally (which are tied to one another ( samam vă trivargam-anyonyānubaddham ). This is like Manu II. 224 ( trivarga iti tu sthitih ). He was in favour of the privileged position of brāhmaṇas in certain respects. He prescribes in all offences a brāhmaṇa was not to suffer bodily punishment&rsquo;.202 But on his forehead shall be made a branded</p>

<p>mark excluding him from dealings with others; that in case of theft the mark was to be a dog, a headless trunk in case of the murder of a human being, mark of female organ in case of violation of a guru&rsquo;s bed, mark of wineseller&rsquo;s flag in case of being guilty of drinking liquor. Such a man, after being branded, was to have his misdeed proclaimed, was to be exiled from the country or was to be settled in mines. It will be seen that in all these matters Kautilya treads the same path as the Dharmasutras and smrtis (like those of Manu and Yājñavalkya ). Kautilya further provides ( 1. 2. 2 and 10-12) that there are four Vidyā8 ( subjects of study ) for the king viz. Anviksiki (latiocination ), trayi ( the three vedas ), vārtā ( economics i, e. agriculture, rearing of cattle and trade ), Dandaniti ( science of politics and government ) and that after upanayana the king should learn Trayi and Anvikșiki from sistas ( learned people ), Virtā from Adhyaksas ( superin tendents of various departments ), Dandaniti from ( theore tical ) teachers and from persons who have practical know ledge. The meaning of Anviksiki ( which acc. to Kautilya I. 2. 10 includes Sārkliya, Yoga ani Lokāyata ) has been discussed at great length in the H. of Dh. Vol. IIl pp. 46-54. Särkhya is based completely on Tarka and does not even postulate God; and Yoga, while accepting the theories of Sākhya, finds a place for īśvara, but not as creator of the world. Therefore Yoga also is to some extent Tarkavidyā. It should be noted that the meaning of the wori Lokiyata changed from time to time ( as shown in H. of Dh. Vol. III, pp. 46-54 and in the notes thereon ). Literally, it means &lsquo;what is reached by ordinary people&rsquo;( loka+ayata, long, extended ). Kķīraswami on Amarakośa states that Anviksiki is &lsquo;tarkavidyā.&rsquo; The Adiparva ( 70.40 ) states that in Kanva&rsquo;s hermitage there</p>

<p>Similarly, in Santiparva ( chapter 218. 9 ) the Lokāyata matat is said to have been expounded by Pancasikha, the first pupil of Asuri, to king Janaka. The doctrines propounded are Sārkhya with a tinge of advaita Vedānta. Later on, the word came to mean a system in which the existence of the soul and of the other world was denied. Vide H. of D. Vol. II. pp. 358-359 and Vol. V. pp. 1205-6, and 1472 1. Kautilya it appears, regards Anviksiki as Tarkavidyā when he remarks (I. 2. 11-12) it (anviksiki) explains the relative strength of these three viz. Trayi, Vārtā and Dandaniti, (thereby) confers benefits on the people by reasoning, keeps the intellect steady in adversity and prosperity and brings about proficiency in thought, word and action. The Mitūksarī on Yāj. I. 317 explains Anviksikī as ātmavidyā anil quotes Manu VII. 43 ( which he appears to have read as · Anviksikiṁ cātmavid bhyah, just as Medhātithi does ). Kaut. (1. 2. 12 ) looks upon Anvīksiki as the lamp of all Vidyās ( sciences ), as the means of (determining ) all actions, the support of all dharmas i. e. duties ). He further provides that the three vidyās are based on ( the proper administration ) of Danda and that (the administration of) Danda when based on discipline brings Yogaksema to living beings.

<p>(place ), time, season for marching on invasion &amp;c. and (in IX. 1. 18 ) he specifies the Cakravartiksetra ( the region of the sovereign ruler ) viz. the region extending northwards between the Himalaya and the ocean and one thousand yojanas across ( deśaḥ prthivi | tasyām Himavat-samudrān: taram-udicinam yojana sahasra-parimānam tiryak cakra vartikşetram ). The word · Yojana .. parimūnai&rsquo;is so placed that it may be construed either with the preceding ( length north-south) or with tiryak ( crosswise, i. e. east to west ). Some mss. read &lsquo;atiryak&rsquo;. The ( east to west ) breadth of India varies greatly and therefore it is better to take</p>
<p>• Yojanao' with the length. Vide H. of Dh. Vol. III pp. 66-67 about the meaning and derivation of Cakravartin, for names of Cakravartins in the Brāhmana texts and Upa nisads and for a passage from the Kavyamimāṁsa for Cakra vartiksetra. The words of K. show that his ambition for his sovereign ruler was limited to the present India and did not embrace other lands such as Java to which Indian culture spread later. Cakra means wheel and is a symbol of power and dominion. The word occurs dozens of times in the Rgveda. Prayers are made to Indra for driving away the asuras with his cakra in Rg. I. 53, 9, II. 11. 20, VIII. 9. 6-9. Indra is said to have set in motion the wheel ( wheel-like orb ) of the Sun (in Rg. IV. 17. 14 ). Vide &lsquo;Dhammacakka-ppavattana-sutta (in SBE. vol. XI. pp. 146 153 ) for the essence of the teaching of Buddha. The Dipa vaṁsa ( VI. 2 ) says about Piyadassana ( Asoka ) that the wheel of his power rolled in the great kingdom of Jambu dvipa. Vide on Cakravartiksetra Prof. K. A. Nilakanta Sastri in Rangaswami Aiyyangar Volume pp. 81-86 and Dr. D. C. Sircar in &lsquo;Sarūpabhārati&rsquo; pp. 315-325 and for the</p>

<p>The A. emphasizes ( in I. 6 ) the great importance of the control of his senses by the king, which is to be attained ( by the king ) by giving up, lust, anger, greed, pride, haughti ness and foolish venturesomeness; and gives for each of the six failings two examples of ancient kings who perished by their being subject to one or other of these six; and then provides that the whole of this science ( of polity) means (is centred in ) control of the senses.306 About the goals of human life, A. states ( in I. 7. 7) that Artha ( material well-being ) is alone supreme ( for the king ); for spiritual good and pleasures of senses depend upon material well-being.</p>
<p>Kautilya prescribes ( in I. 19. 9-24 ) an ideal daily time table for his king who must always be active ( since if the king is active his servants become so, I. 19. 1 and 5 ). The day is divided into eight parts and the night also into eight parts. Supposing the day begins at 6 A. M. the work to be transacted in, each of the eight parts of the day is as follows. (1) 6. to 7. 30 A. M. he should listen to the measures taken for defence and income and expenditure; (II) 7. 30-9 A. M. the king should look into the affairs of citizens and the country people ; (III ) 9-10. 30 A. M. he should take a bath and meals and engage in study ;(IV) 10. 30 A. M.-to 12 noon he should receive gold (i. e. l&rsquo;evenue in coins) and receive heads of departments; (V) 12 noon to 1.30 P. M. he should consult the council of ministers by sending letters and should acquaint himself with secret information gathered by spies ; (VI) 1. 30-3 P. M. he should engage himself at his pleasure in recreations or hold consultations ; (VII) 4. 30-6 P. M. he should consider military plans with the commander-in-chief; and when the day ends he should engage in evening worship. The time table for the night is as follows: (1) first 8th part of night) 6 P. M.-7. 30 P. M. he should see secret agents ; ( II ) 7. 30-9 P. M. he should take a bath, meals and engage in study ; (III ) 9 P. M.-10.-30 P. M. he should lie down amidst sounds</p>

<p>of musical instruments, and (IV-V) 10. 30 P. M.-1. 30 P. M., he should sleep; (VI) 1, 30 A. M.-3 A. M. he should awaken to the sound of musical instruments, ponder over the rules of the science of politics and also over the work that has to be done by him; ( VII )-3. A. M.-4. 30 A. M.&ndash;he should be in consultation with councillors and send out secret agents; (VIII)-4. 30 A. M.-6 A. M. he should receive blessings from priests, his teachers, purohita ( chaplain ) and see his physi cian, chief cook and astrologer and then after yoing round a cow with its calf and a bull lie should repair to the assembly hall or he should divide the day and night into other or ( different ) parts in keeping with his strength and carry out his duties.</p>
<p>It would be noticel how arduous is the work to be done by the ideal king and how his hours of rest and sleep are only four and a half from 9 P. M. to 1. 30 A, M. It may be noted that Manu VII. 210-225 and Yāj. I. 327-333 contain similar but briefer provisions about the daily time-table of the king</p>
<p>In the same chapter ( 1. 19. 33-35 ) the Kautiliya engages in a fine metaphor, comparing the king&rsquo;s work of administra tion with a sacrifice and states: “Endeavour is the vow, and the fee is equal behaviour ( to all ), his coronation is the diksā (initiation rite of a Vedic yujna ).&rdquo; He places a very high and noble ideal before kings in the words in the happiness of the subjects lies the happiness of the king, what is beneficial to the subjects is to his tenetit; what is liked by (or dear to ) the king is not (really ) beneficial to him, but what is dear to the subjects is a really ) to his benefit. Therefore, the king, being constantly active, should regulate, or manage material well-being; activity ( endeavour is the root of material well being, the opposite (of activity ) is the root of calamities.</p>
<p>The 6th Adhikarana deals with the seven constituents of the Mandala viz. the king, chief minister, the country, the fortified capital, treasury, the army, ally. In VI. 1. 3-6 Kautilya specifies numerous qualities that the king should possess, such as ( to mention only a few ) birth in a high family, being endowed with intelligence, bravery, non-en für ing nature, quick despatch, cleverness. This chapter leads on to the 7th Adhikarana on Sūdgunya' i.e. the six aspector measures of foreign policy (viz. place, war &amp;c) and to the 8th</p>
<p>230</p>
<p>History of Dhurmusastra ·</p>
<p>(on Vyasinas or calamities of the constituent elements ). Kau. tilya&rsquo;s position was ( VIII. 2. 1, Raja rujyamiti prakrtisaikse pah). that the king and the ruler&rsquo;s kingdom is a summary ( of the seven ) elements i. e. they are the primary or foremost elements out of the seven ( mentioned ) above. If there be no ruler the country will at once be ruined, what is called Mitsjanyrigna208 will reign supreme, there will be no security of life and property, the strong will devour the weak. Simi larly, if there is no country there will be no king. The other elements are necessary but of secondary importance, e. g. a king may carry on administration for some time at least without a minister: and may appoint a ininister when he pleases. Kautilya himself says &lsquo;It is the king alone who appoints the class of servants such as the councillors, the purohita (chaplain ) anil others, directs the activities of superintendents of departments; when the king himself is éndowed with excellence he makes the constituent elements</p>
<p>of the State ) endowed with excellences required by each of them; what character he las, that character the constituents come to possess, since they are dependent on him as to endea vour and reinissness; for the king is in the position of their head&rsquo;.207 The words of K. ( raji rajyam&hellip;&hellip;sanksepah) may also be interpreted as stating that the king is the State, i. e. he is the most important of the seven elements. That would be a theoretical statement. He makes it clear (in VIII. 1. 13 ff) in what sense the king is supreme viz. that it is he who appoints the ministers and removes ministers, who arranges</p>

<p>Though Kautilya was a brāhmana of the orthodox type, he seems to have been a follower of Byhaspati, who according to the Mahābhārata (quoted above ), held that there was a great difference between the code of conduct for ordinary people and that for the king. A strong ruler is absolutely necessary for the good administration of the country. There fore, Kautilya sets out all kinds of sinister methods in Adhi karana XIV for liquidating an enemy, such as intrigues, un scrupulous use of poison, desperadoes and prostitutes, magic and charms. His motto in this matter seems to have been that the end justifies the means. This earned for him the hatred of scholars like Bana; vide above p. 174. He wanted to be thorongh in strengthening the hands of the king in governing the country. The Pancatantra 208 says &lsquo;the realm (or gist) of politics is threefold viz. thoroughness according to Vişnugupta, the securing of allies acc. to Bhārgava ( Ušanas ) and distrust acc. to Brhaspati.&rsquo; It should not be supposed that all the sinister methods were employed by him or any one else at all times. As the Kamasutra says' because a śāstra contains certain matters, it is not seen that they are actually used in practice; the matters dealt with in sāstras are all-embracing, while actual use is limited in extent'.209 As regards the adhikarana called Aupanisadikam (secret pratices, poisons and magic and spells ) Kautilya provides certain limi tations. He says &lsquo;for the purpose of safeguarding the insti tution of four varnas, he (the king ), should employ secret practices against the unrighteous. The group of poisons such as Kālakūta should be introduced into articles used by the enemy on his body through the instrumentality of approved men and women of mleccha communities disguised as hump backs, dwarfs, kirátas, dumb or deaf persons, appearing trust worthy as to country, dress, profession, speech and birth.

<p>a constitutional king and not an absolute ruler. That ques tion has been dealt with in H. of Dh. Vol. III (pr. 92-98 ). The present author does not agree with K. P. Jayaswal.</p>
<p>It is necessary to put together briefly some of the chief grounds on which the Arthasastra is assigned to about 300 B. C.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The unanimous tradition of numerous Sanskrit works and of Buddhist and Jain sources that Kautilya or Canakya helped Candragnta and that he wrote a treatise on Arthaśā. stra and the fact that no other Kautilya or Canakya, author of a work on A. or as the minister of an ancient king, in the first centuries of the Christian era has been known so far.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kautilya is not chary of naming individual writers, schools and scaryote (in general). The last (ācāryāḥ ) he mentions about 53 times and differs from them 50 times. On VIII. 4 alone dealing with calamities due to fate such as con flagration, floods, diseases, famine and epidemics he mentions ācāryas twelve times and differs from them in all cases and on VII. 9 he differs from them seven times. He mentions the following schools. Ambhiyahi ( once on I. 17. 27 ), Āusunasah (7 times in all on 1. 2. 6, I. 15. 49, II. 7. 14, III. 6. 5, III, 11. **, III. 17. 4, X. 6. 1), lärāśarah ( I. 8. 7, I. 15-23, I. 17. 9. II. 7. 12, III. 1, 26, VIII. 3. 30 ), Bárhaspatyāh (I. 2. 4, I. 15. 48, II. 7. 13, III. 11. 46, III. 17. 13, X. 6. 2); Mänavah (1. 2. 2, I. 15. 47, II. 7. 11, III. 11. 45, III, 17. 3). Instead of Pārāśarā), Mysore ed. of Shamasastri reads Parāśarah&rsquo; in I. 8, I. 15. Kautilya mentions the views of the following individual writers, Kaunapadantin (1. 8. 14, I. 17. 15, VIII. 3. 47); Piśuna (1. 8. 11, . 15. 27, 1. 17. 12, VIII. 1. 33, VIII. 3. 39), Bühudantiputra ( 1. 8. 24 ); Bharadrāja ( I. 8. 1, 1, 15. 14, I. 17. 6, V. 6. 24, VIII. 1. 6, VIII, 3. 8, XII. I. 2.); Vāta vyñdhi ( I. 8. 6, 1. 17. 18, VII. 1. 3, VIII. 1, 53, VIII. 3 55 ); Viśālāksa ( 1. 8.3, I. 15. 18, I. 17. 7, VIII. 1. 19, VIII. 3. 24, XII. 1. 5). Of these, three names viz. Piśmua, Vätaryachi and Kaunapadanta appear to be nicknames. It may be pointed out that in the Sakuntala the ininister of Dusyanta is said to have been Piśuna, which literally means ( wicked or backbiter, &lsquo;Piśunau khalasacakau&rsquo; says Amara ); some commentator say it is the name of Nárada. Kaunapadanta is said to be nickname of Bhisma by the Nayacanlrika and by Yogghaibh. Kunapa means a corpse and so Kaunapadanta would need</p>

<p>one having teeth that emit i nasty smell like that of a dead body&rsquo;. All these are mentioned in I. 8 and whenever all or some of them are mentioned, Bharadvāja is mentioned first and the others also occur in the same order as in I. 8.</p>
<p>It would be noticed that none of the famous Dharmasūtra authors such as Gautama, Āpastumba, Hirayya kesin, Baud hāyana, Vasistha is mentioned by the Kauţiliya even in the Dharmasthiya and Kantakasodhana sections and many Adhikaranas. Therefore, it is probable that the Kauţiliya is prior to them in point of time or inay be contemporaneous with some of them. Most of the Dharmasūtra writers are generally held to have flourished some centuries before the Christian era. In V.5. 10-11 certain ministers are named as having left the king&rsquo;s service on seeing certain signs of his displeasure viz. Katyāyana, Kaninka Bhāradvāja, Dirgha Cārāyana, Ghotamukha, Kinjalka, Piśuna and Piśunaputra. Piśuna may be the same as the writer Piśuna mentioned above. Pisunaputra may be his son. Ghotakamukha is mentioned as an author in Kamasutra (I. 1. 4). The others also might have been authors on Nitiśnstra. Kaninka Bhāradvaja may be the same as the Bharad vāja mentioned above as a predecessor in the Artbaśāstra. Bhāradvāja is one of the expounders of Rājaśāstra mentioned in Säntiparva 58. 3. Chap. 140 ( 71 verses ) of Santiparva is called Kaņikopadeśa at the end. But in the verses at the start it is said to be a dialogue between Bharadvāja and king Satruñjaya of Sauvira.</p>

<li>The Arthaśāstra was composed at a time when Budd hism had not made much progress in India and was confined to monks. The only clear and definite reference to Buddhists is in III. 20. 16, where among other matters it is provided * for a Candāla touching an Arya lady, for one feeding Sākya, Ajivaka and others and Sūdra ascetics at rites in honour of Gods and Manes the fine shall be one hundred panas. The Buddha&rsquo;s teaching spread only among monks and had not spread far and wide till Asoka&rsquo;s reign. It&rsquo;secured royal favour only under Asoka during whose reigo the third Buddhist Council was held about 247 B. C. The Dipavamsa ( XX. 20 ff) expressly states that the three pitakas and their corte mentaries were transmitted orally ( Mukhapatha ) and were reduced to writing in Ceylon in the reign of Vattagamani ( 29-17 B. C.). Buddhism was a State</li>

<p>and was in a flourishing condition in India from Kaniska&rsquo;s times up to the first half of the 7th century A. D. (as the Hargacarita and Yuan Chwang&rsquo;s travels show). Hence if the Arthaśāstra was composed in the 3rd century A. D. as Jolly and some others say it could not have afforded to treat the Buddhists monks with scant respect as it actually does.</p>

<p>The Arthnśāstra uses the word Rājā only (not Samrāt nor Sārvabhauma) for the ruler just as' Asoka speaks about himself only us rājā in his edicts, though be appears to have ruled over the whole of India up to Mysore at least.</p>
</li>

<p>Some technical terins are cominon to A. and to Asoka&rsquo;s edicts. A few of these may be mentioned here. Yukta (an officer ) iu A. II. 5. 16 ( Yuktopayuktutatpuruşāņām ), II. 8. 3, 23, II. 9. 33-34 and in Rock Edicts III and IV; Mahamátra ( A. I. 12. 4, V. 1. 5 and 15 uud in Rock Edicts VI and XII and in several other places ); Parisā (parişad, council of mini sters ) in R. E. IV ( parisäpi yutte ilapayissati ) and A. I. 15. 47-50 and 58; Purusăh ( subordinate officers under Yuktas and Upayuktas ) in A. II. 5. 16 und Pillar Edicts I, IV and VII; Pradestr (in A. IV. 1. ), a Magistrate ) and Prūdesika ( Rock Edict III, the exact connotation cannot be estublished). Some of these words occur in Panini also e. g. Yuktå occurs in Pån VI. 2. 66, Ayukta (in A. I. 15. 10 und 13, II. 6. 20 und Pān. 11. 3. 40 ); Ākarika (a ininer, A. II. 12. 20 ) and Dauva rika (in A. I. 12. 6, V. 3. 5, V. 6. 5 meaniny lead usher in &amp; palace') and Pan IV. 4. 69 ( tatra niyuktah ); Püyini IV. 4. 70 shows that he was aware of many words ending in &lsquo;agara&rsquo; (as in &lsquo;agāräutit-than&rsquo;) such as Bhindāgārika. The word</p>

<p>Vyusta &lsquo;in A. 11. 6. 12 and II. 7. 31-33 deserves to be con sidered here. Pånini ( V. 1. 97 &ldquo;Vyustidibhyosa&rsquo;) provides for the formation of words like &lsquo;Vaiyusta&rsquo; (meaning what is to be given or what is to be done at Vyusta'. The Vyustādigana has over a dozen words. The exact meaning of Vyusta is not clear. But, occurring as it does in A. 11. 6. 12 (rāja vargam, māsaḥ, paksah, divasasca vyustam, iti kuilah, after the regnal year, month, fortnight and day), Vyusţa should mean time (ghatiká or muhurta &amp;c.) after morning or sunrise. Vyust is a past participle from the root &lsquo;us&rsquo; (1st conj. to heat) with &lsquo;vi&rsquo; and apparently means the same thing as vyus (whidh occurs five times in Ry) and · Vyusti' which occurs over thirty times in the Rgveda ( as Vyusțau or Vyusțișu ), often</p>

<li>A. is some centuries earlier than the Yāj. Smrti. In the first place, on inany points such as succession and inheri tance, Yüj. is far in advance of A. One decisive circumstanc is as follows. Yāj. ( I. 319-20 ) dealing with the regulations about royal grants of fields &amp;c. provides that the grant should be inscribed on a piece of cloth (silken or other ) or on it copper-plate. A. in 11. 10 (śāsanādhikāra ) provides how a śāsana is to be written, but says not a word about inscribing it on a piece of cloth or a copperplate. This clearly indicates that the Yāj. Smrti was composed when the inscribing of royal grants or orders on copper lates had become common while K. shows uo kuowledge about this method and refers ouly to putruku (lent) in II. 10. 58 and in II. 17. 9 directs the superintendent of Kujiya (Forest produce) to collect leaves of Tāli, Tila and Bhurja ( Tälitālabhurjānāin patram). The earliest record on a copperplate so far discovered in India is the Sohāgpur plate which records an order issued by the Mahämätras of Srivastī and which is placed by competent scholars like Fieet between 300 B. C. to 180 B. C. ( vide JRAS for 1907 pp. 509 and E. I. Vol. XXII p. 2 by K. P. Jayaswal). Another early copperplate is the Taxila copper plate inscription of Patika of the year 78 ( vide C. I.

He should also establish presiding deities of the dwelling places as enumerated. The city gates should be presided over by Brahmā, Indra, Yama and Senāpati (Skanda ). Outside (the city ) at the distance of 100 dhunus from the moat should be sanctuaries, holy places, groves and water dams and the deit! i of the quarters in the respective quarters. &hellip;&hellip; The habitat us for heretics, pasandas and cándalas should be on the outskirts of the cremition ground'. &lsquo;Aparājita&rsquo; means &lsquo;invincible&rsquo; und &lsquo;apratibata&rsquo; (irresistible ). But here these words stand for somc god or deity. Jayanta is the son of Indra and Vaija vanta is Indra&rsquo;s palace, acc. to Amarasimha. Jayanta and Vaijayanta may mean victorious. But in this passage they mean some gol. The Malayalam com. holds them respectively to be Durgā (probably. it reads ‘Aparajita'), Vişnu; Subrahmanya and Indra. &lsquo;Yathoddeśam&rsquo; appears to mean&rsquo;as enumerated in the works of Västu pūjā (or Vastu śānti)'. Vide H. of Dh. Vol. II. pp. 833-35. The word põrandalt frequently occurs in A. and generally means heretic or heretical monk. For example, iu I. 18. I A. provides that a prince under disfavour with the reigning king may secretly rob the corporation of beretics of their wealth. In III. 16. 38-10 A. provides in legal disputes the fines in posed may be paid off by beretical süllure who possess vo cash nor gold by doing penance with fasts and vows according to their Owli practices except in case of Pirusya ( verbal and physical injurie:s ), theft, forcible seizure and adultery.215 Manu also ( in 1. 118 aud IV. 30 ) employs the words Pāşanda and Paşandin in the sense of heretical sect or monk.

<p>the same sense as in Manu. But Asoka employs the word pāsunda in the sense of a religious order or sect and not in a derogatory sense. In Rock edict XII he says &lsquo;King Priya darsin honours all päsandas ( sandāni), all ascetics and householders with gifts and in various modes of honour&rsquo;. In Rock Edict V. Asoka says he appointed officers called Mahā mātras when he had been crowned king thirteen years and that those high officers were concerned with all pasandas (all sects or denominations ) for the glorification of dhamma. This establishes that the word pusanda had been in use long before Asoka&rsquo;s time. Iu Kautilya&rsquo;s day, in the Mahābhārata and in Madu the word had been used in a derogatory sense. Dr. B. M. Barua (in &lsquo;Inscriptions of Asoka, Part II. p. 255) holds that</p>
<p>pāsaņda&rsquo; is a corruption of pärşada'. I am sorry that I cannot agree with him. Parişad (later parşad also ) is a very ancient word. It occurs in the Rgveda (III. 33. 7) in the literal sense ( viz. crowding or sitting round ). In the Br. Up. VI. 2. 1 it occurs in the usual sepse (an assembly of learned men or of men ). Panini provides that from Parisad' one gets the derivative pärisadya'( IV. 4. 101 ) or pārisada' by Yuguvibhāya. It is difficult to see how from pārşada (which simply means &lsquo;member of u parişad&rsquo;) we can get päsanda (phonetically as well as semantically ), when it means a heretical sect (or even any sect or denomination ). The word Pārsada is employed in the Nirukta ( I. 17) in the sense of Prātiśākhyas' (padaprakstini sarvacaraṇānām pārsadani ).</p>
<p>The establishment of the temples of Siva and Vaisravana (i. e. Kubera ) was in vogue even in the times before the Vārtikas on Pin. and the Mahābhāsya and the Mahābhārata. While commenting on Pan. VI. 3. 26 ( devatādvandve ca ) and the 2nd Vārtika thereon ( Brahma-prajāpatyādinām ca ), the examples given by the Mahābhīşya are Brahmaprajāpati, Siva vaibravanau, Skandavisākhau. The worship of Vaisravana and Viśākha declined later on. Therefore, when the A. mentions them together it follows that its age may be at Jeast that of the Vārtikakāra (i. e. about 300 B. C.). The Vana parva ( 274. 15-17) states that Kubera is lord of wealth, immortal, a Lokapăla and a friend of Siva and king of Yaksas.</p>

<p>stoma210 and other solemn vedic sacrifices (keratu ) for the priests, if any, falling ill at different stages of the Soma sacrifices and mentions the Bphagpatisava. When Buddhism was in the ascendant from the days of Asoka and Kaniska till several centuries after the Christian era, such elaborate provisions about Vedic sacrifices like Agnistoma and Bșhas. patisava in a work on government and adininistration are not likely to have been set out. That leads to the inference that the work was composed before Buddhism came to be in the ascendant and when Vedic sacrifices were still very common. Manu (in VIII. 206-207) provides in a general way how the fees are to be distributed among priests in a religious cere inony wheu one of them has to stop from taking part in any religious rite and leaves it to the other priests what was to be given to the one that leaves in the middle of a religious rite, but does not mention any solemn Vedic sacrifice.</p>
<p>This passage is quoted from K. in the Vyavahārasiromani of Nārāyana, who was a pupil of the famous Vijñāneśvara ( published by T. R. Chintamani in Annals of Oriental Research, Madras, at p. 29 ) and in the Vyavahāranirnaya of Varadarāja, pp. 284-5 (published by the Adyar Library ).</p>

At the close of the chapter A. states that at the end of two years and a half an intercalary month is requir ed in grisma (summer) and another intercalary month on the expiry of five years. The first statement that there is a difference of six muhurtas between the longest and the shortest day i. e. the two are respectively of 36 and 24 ghatikas, is the same as that of the Vedārga Jyotisa. Western scholars place the Vedaiya Jyotisa at about 400 B. C. The present author would like to place it some centuries earlier. Vide H. of Dh. Vol. V. part 1 p. 505 note 732. The statement that two intercalary months were allowed in five years was also the rule, according to the Mahabharata ( Virītaparva 52. 3-4 ) and the Yājusa Vedāngajyotina ( verse 35 ).</p>
<p>It is really not necessary to adduce further evidence for establishing the proposition that the Arthasastra follows the rules laid down by the Vedārga-Jyotisa about the almanac, that it does not rely on the rules laid down in the Siddhantas about almanacs and that, therefore, it should be assigned to 300 B. C. and not so late as 300 A. D. Some points may ve be stressed.</p>

If it had been composed five or six centuries after Pānini (i. e. about the 1st or 3rd century A. D. as some scholars suppose ) it would have most probably followed Pānini completely. Therefore, the Arthaśāstra must, be held to have been com posed at a time when Pånini&rsquo;s work had not become univer: sally accepted or relied upon.</p>
<p>XI. Many of the words used by the Arthaśāstra in the matter of Govt. and administration are in accord with Pänini. For example, the Arthaśāstra emphasises that the king is there for good goverument (vide p. 229 above for prajāsukhe sukham rājùah'). Panini also provides that the word ‘rājanvān' (VIII. 2. 14 ) is used when there is a good king and that otherwise the world is &lsquo;rājavan&rsquo;. Many words about officers found in A. are mentioned by Panini either in sūtras or in the ganas. For example, A. has the longest adhikarana called &lsquo;adhyaksa pracára! Pånini (VI. 2. 69 ) provides Vibhāsk dhyakse!. Kautilya mentions about twentyfive kinds of departments and their adhyaksas Pānini (III. 2.21 ) provides for the word &lsquo;lipikara&rsquo;.

Panini has two sūtras &lsquo;tatra niyuktah&rsquo; and &lsquo;agar äntät-than&rsquo;(IV. 4. 69-70 ), while A. employs such words as *Dauvärika and Akarika &lsquo;(II. 12. 20 &lsquo;äkare niyuktah&rsquo;), &lsquo;Kosthāgārika&rsquo; (from Kosthāgåra in A. II. 4; 8), Bhāndāgārika ( from &lsquo;bhāndăgira in A. II. 4. 10). Froin the word &lsquo;atyaya&rsquo; (which is included in the Vinayadi-gana by Panini V. 4. 34 ) we get&rsquo;atyayika &lsquo;( which occurs in A. I. 15. 58, V. 5. 2) and also in Asoka&rsquo;s Rock Edict VI (acayika ) and there is Vina yadhikārikam (in A. I. 1).

<p>Two of the most difficult problems concerning the Artha Šāstra are its relation to Manusmrti and to the Mahābhārata. As regards the Manusmrti it would be shown below that some verses and half verses are identical in both A. and the Manusmrti. The extant Manusmrti refers by name to a few predecessors, such as Atri, Ututhyatanaya y e Gautama ), Saunaka and Bhrgu (in Manu III. 16 Rand Vasistha ( Manu VIII. 140 ) and states the views of Svayam</p>

<p>I242</p>
<p>History of Dharmaśāstra</p>
<p>bhuva Manu ( IX. 158 ) or simply of Manu ( as in VIII. 279). The A. mentions the views of Mánavāḥ&rsquo; several times but those views do not all correspond to the statements in the Manus&rsquo;mrti. In the Dharmasthiya section the A. often agrees with Mann and Yāj. but sometimes Yāj. does not agree with A. Compare Manu VIII. 279 with A. III. 19. 8, but Yaj. II. 215 differs. In the present author&rsquo;s opinion Yáj. is much later than the A. and the extant Manusmrti also is later than it, though, it is nearer in time to A. The extant Manusmrti is a revised version of the original Manusmrti made between 200 B. C. to 200 A. D.</p>
<p>Vas. 19. 17 cites a śloka (&lsquo;na bhinda-kársapana &amp;c&rsquo;) as a Mänava sloka (in the Upendravajrå metre ) not found in extant Manu. Verses are cited as Manu&rsquo;s by comparatively early writers like Višvarūpa ( first half of 9th century A. D. ), but they are not found in the extant Manu e. g. the verse</p>
<p>• Dhanam yad-yāgasilānām &lsquo;cited by him on Ynj. III. 252 as Manu&rsquo;s is not so found.</p>
<p>As regards the Mahabharata, the problem is far more difficult. As shown above the Santiparva (in 58. 1-3 ) names certain expounders of rājušiīstra, almost all of whom are named by A. and criticized. Another noteworthy fact is that the Mahābhārata in its several parvans mentions the views of Manu (simply ) or of Svāyambhuva or Prácetasa dozens of times e. g. Svāyambhuva occurs in.</p>
<p>Ādi-73. 8-12 (compare Manu III. 20-21, 23, 24-25 ); this last is same as Manu III. 25; Ādi 120. 36 ( on 12 kinds of sons ), Vanaparva (180. 34-35 ) same as Manu ( II. 29, 170, 172 ), Udyoga 37. 1., slinti 21. 11-12; Anu jāsana 114. 12.</p>
<p>Prācetasa Mann&ndash;two verses from Rājadharmas in Santi 57. 43-45, same two verses in Udyogaparva 33. 79-80, Anu Sāsana 46. 1-2 ( Manusmộti III, 54 ).</p>
<p>Manu alone-in Ādiparva 41. 31, 74. 99, Sänti 56. 23-25 (last two verses as occurring in Manu&rsquo;s dharmas, one&rsquo;adbh yognir&rsquo; occurs in Manusmrti IX. 32 and in Udyoga 15. 34 ); Santi 78.31 (brahmalokajitah svargyān&hellip;tăn-Manur-abravit), 112-17 and 121. 10-12, 152, 14, 265.5 (on ahimsa); Anušāsalt 44.18, 44.23, 47.35 ( štistra of Manu), 61. 34-35 (Chaturtham matain-asmākam Manoh Srutvānusāsanam ); compare Mapa VIII. 18 for same view ); Anusāsaua 65. 3, 67.19 (Manu IH</p>

<p>In the preceding reference is made only to passages of the Epic in which Manu is expressly named. But there are hundreds of verses that are common to the Mahābhārata and the extant Manu-smrti. Dr. Bühler in his Introduction to the translation of the Manusmrti (S. B. E. Vol. 25 ) states that in three parvaus alune (Vana, Sānti and Anušāsana) 260 verses are found in Manu also ( Intro. p. LXXXIII-XC) and his conclusin was that the Mahābhārata influenced the final redaction of Manu.</p>
<p>The present Mahäbhārata contains many matters that are very much like those in the Arthuśāstra. The eulogy of clandu occurs in A. ( I. 4.8.-19), in Säntiparva (chap. 15 and 121 ) and also in Mauu VII, 17-31 and some of the verses in the latter two are almost the same. The word &lsquo;labubu praśamana ' occurs in Santi 45.10 and A. XIII. 5. In A. VI. 1.1 tbe elements of the State ure said to be seven and tbe same is the idea in Südtiparva 5 and Manu IX. 294. For the antiquity of the Itibāsa and Purana, vide H. of Dh. Vol. V. pp. 816 ft. In the Päriplava that was listened to for a year in Ašvamedha, Itibāsa and Purana were recited on the 8th and 9th days (vide H. of Dh. Vol. V. p. 866 ). Therefore, it follows that some legendary lore like that in the Mahābhārata existed in the Vedic age. It seems that Epic poems were probably the earliest of the three viz. the Mahabharata, Dharm sästra and Arthasõstra. But it should be noted that the extant Mahābhāratu several times refers to Dharmaśāstras as in Vanaparva 207. 83, 293. 34, 313. 105, śānti 167. 4, Anušāsana 9. 6-7. These verses might be later additious.</p>
<p>We can see from Pāṇini that the epic and some of its principal characters and some episodes were known to him e.g. he knows Bhārata and Mahabharata (VI. 2. 38 ), Yudhisthira (VIII. 3.95), Väsudeva and Arjuna ( IV. 3.98 ); &lsquo;Vasudevaka&rsquo; would mean Väsudevah bhaktirasya&rsquo; and Patanjali expressly says that Vasudeva is the name of Bhagavat (Vasudevasab dasya pūrvanipātam vaksyāmiti, athavā naisā ksatriyakhya, sanjñaikā tatrabhavatah).

II. 2. 34 ; • Duryodhana' and · Duḥsa sana': seem to be known at least to the Vārtikakāra (vide Mahābhāsya on Vārtika on Pāh. III. 3. 130 ). The name Asvatthāinan is derived in a Kárikā (sthămno lugajināt tathā ) on Vārtika ( on IV. 3. 60). Vārtika 6 dealing with</p>
<p>· Akhyānam' and Värtika 15 on Pån. III. 1. 26 refer to the story of Kamgavadha and Balibandha and the Mahābhāsya on the last states that in dramas and pictures ‘Kamsavadha ? and Balibandha&rsquo;are exhibited, although both these events occurred long ago ( katham vartamānakālată Kamsam ghāt yati Balim bandhayatiti cirahate Kamse cirabaddhe ca Balau)' and further some are shown in the dramatic or pictorial pre sentations as devotees of Kaisa and some as Vasudeva bhakta. The Mahābhāsya on Värtika 2 on Pāụ. III. 2. 111 quotes jaghāna Kariisam kila Vasudevah, &lsquo;Kielhorn Vol. II. p. 119). The story of Kaṁsa&rsquo;s defeat and death before the Rājasuya of Yudhisthira is mentioned in Sabhāparva 14. 30-34 and in Udyoyaparva 128. 38-40. It follows therefore, that the Mahabharata along with at least some of its akhyānas was well-known to Panini and the Vārtikakāra. The Mahābhāşya (Kielhorn, Vol. I. p. 426 on Pān. II, 2. 24) quotes</p>
<p>Sankarsana-dvitiyasya balam Kronasya vardhatām&rsquo; and “ prāsāde dhana-pati-rāma-keśavānām', thereby showing that Sarkarsana or Balarāma and Krsna were brothers ( Kielhorn I. p. 436 on Pán. II. 2. 34 ).</p>
<p>Páyini and the author of the Vārtikas flourished as shown above (pp. 75-79 ) respectively about 450-400 B. C. anii 300-250 B. C. Therefore, the Mahābhārata and some legends must be held to have come in vogue not later than 450 B. C. The references in the Arthaśāstra (noted below ) to the stories in the Mahabhārata need not lead to the A. being assigned to a date later than 300 B. C.</p>
<p>Janamejaya is said to have been guilty of brahmuhatyä (killing of a brāhmana ) unintentionally and he is said to have gone to sage Saunaka Indrota who instructed him as to the actions that would free him of the great sin (in sânţiparva, Chap. 150-152 ). Aila, son of Ilā ( who was both mother and father ), is Purūravas that ruled over thirteen dvipas (COM</p>

<p>tinents :) and yet deprived (through greed), brāhmaṇas of their jewels ( valuables, ratnas ) and was cursed by great suges and perished ( Adiparva 75. 18-22). That Yudhisthira and Nala engaged in gambling is mentioned by A. in VIII.3.43. The story of Nala (and Damayanti, his queen ) is narrated at great length in the Vanaparva (chap. 53–79) and is one of the very popular and fascinating stories in the Mahābhārata. In the extant epic Puskara is said to have been the brother of Nala (Vana parva 50. 4 ff') and won in the gombling bout, while A, states that it was Jayatsena that defeated Nala in gambling. Nala is stated in the epic to have been the son of Virasena and Nala&rsquo;s young son&rsquo;s name was Indrasena. It is therefore likely that A. is correct and the epic story was tampered with slightly later. In the extant Karna parva ( 91. 13 ) it is again affirmed that Nala was defeated in gambling by Puskara. Yudhisthira was defeated in gambling with Duryo dhana and Sakuri (Sabhāparva, Chup. 58.77). In A. I. 8. several kings are mentioned as having serished through one of the six fatal vices ( Kamu, Kopa &amp;c). Duryodhana perished 230 (A. I. 6. 8) through pride by refusing to restore to the Pando vas ever as little ( of the kingdom ) as would be pierced by the tip of a sharp veedle (Udyoga parva ). The story of Dambhodbhava mentioned in A. I. 6. 9 occurs in Udyoga parva (.99. 5-41 ), le being humbled by the great sage Nara by dis charging at him only reeds.</p>
<p>The story of Arjuna also called Kirtavirya or Sahasrár juna ) king of the Haihayas and ruler at Māhismati occurs several times in the Mahabharata (viz, in Vanaparva 115. 9ff, Sänti 49.35ff, Amuśäsana 153. 3 ff. and Āsvomedhika Chap. 29 ) and Santipurva ( 46.53 ) states that Kārtavirya and his sons and descendants were killed by Parasurama because of his haughtiness towards Jamadagni (his father). In the Raghuvamsa ( VI. 38-40) Kalidasa gives a grand description of Kärtavīrya&rsquo;s prowess. The story of Vātapi and Agastys (referred. to in A. I 6.10 ) occurs in the Rāmāyana and also in the Mahābhārata (Vanaparva 98-99 ). For Ambarisa vide above and Santiparva 29. In A. XIII. 3. 54-55 reference is made to a secret agent with a shaved head or with matted hair</p>

<p>K. (in IV. 8.12 ) states that Animāndavya declared him self to be a thief, though not a thief, through fear of the pain of torture.

<p>From the above discussion about the references to the Mahābhārata and its stories and characters in Panini, Patañjali and in Kautilya&rsquo;s work it is clear that the A. knew not only the main story of the great epic and its chief characters but several episodes also.</p>
<p>As regards Puränug, the A. is very sparing about references to them. In V. 6.47 (which is a verse) there is reference to Itihūsa and Purānu. Other references to Purūnas such as in I. 5. 14 (Purana being included under Itihāsa) and in 111.7.29 (about Paurāṇika Sūta and Māgadha) might be interpolations. The Upanişads speak of Itihisapurāļa as a compound or as separate words in Chandogya Up. VII. 1. 2 and 4 and VII.7.1 and Brhadāranyaka II. 4. 10, IV. 1, 4, 1V.5.11. Vide, for the history of Purānas from ancient times onwards, H. of Dh. Vol. V. pp. 816-825 and the four or five stages in the evolution of Puranas pp. 853-55 of the same Vol. Kautilya seems to have known the Purānas. He says (111.7.29 ) that sūtu and magaclh« of the Puranas are quite different from members of the mixed castes called sūted and magadha and includes Purāna (1. 5 ) among the subjects of royal study grouped under the head of itihcsl.</p>
<p>Kautilya exhibits a wonderful kuowledge of herbs and drugs and Dr. Jolly thinks that his duteria Medioa is more extensive than even Susruta&rsquo;s. But the dates of Caraka and Susruta are far from being settled and no approximately cer. tain conclusion can be drawn from the drugs mentioned in the Kauţiliya. Kautilya speaks of ' rasada' (one who administers.</p>

<p>mercurial poison ) and prescribes banishment for those who trade in or administer &lsquo;rasa&rsquo; for money in order to do away with a person secretly ( IV. 4. 17-18 ). In 11. 13 he speaks of gold that is &lsquo;rasa-vidilha&rsquo; (amalgamated with mercury ) and in II. 12 of liquids containing gold ( rasāļ kājcanikāḥ ) and of Hinguluka. Dr. Jolly thinks that this knowledge of metal lurgy and alchemy is of Graeco-Syriac origin and so the Kauțiliya is a work of the third century A. D.</p>
<p>It is of great importance to note that Kautilya lays down (11.4 ) that in the midst of the fort were to be constructed the temples of Siva, Vaisravana, the Asvins, Lakşmi and Madiri ( Durga ? ) and niches were to be set apart for Aparajita, Apratihata, Jayanta and Vaijayanta and that the tutelary deities of the gates were to be Brahmä, Indra, Yama and Senāpati (i. e. Skanila ). We know from the Mahābhāsya??? ( Kielhorn, Vol. II. p. 429) on Pāṇini ( V. 3. 99 ‘jivikārthe câpanye') that the Mauryas set up images out of greed for money and that in its day images of Siva, Skanda and Visakha were worshipped.</p>
<p>The foregoing discussion clearly shows that the Kauţiliya has certainly an ancient atmosphere about it, and that all that has so far been gathered from it agrees with its traditional date of 300 B. C. and no cogent arguments have been yet brought forward that would compel us to assign it a date later than the above by six centuries.</p>
<p>Two commentaries on the Kautiliya have been bronght to light so far, one composed by Bhattasvāmin being called Pratipada pañcikā and the other the Nayacandrika of Mādha vayajvan. Both are fragments. The first was published in the Journal of the Bihar and Orissa Research Society ( 1925 1926, vol. XI and XII) by Messrs. K. P. Jayasval and A. Banerji-sastri. The com, is incomplete and begins with the 8th adhyâya of the 2nd adhikarana and reaches up to the 36th adhyāya of the adhikarana. The commentary on the whole work must have been very extensive, as the portion already printed on a part of the 2nd adhikarana alone occu pies 214 pages.

The commentary Naya candriká contained in Dr. Jolly&rsquo;s edition (Lahore ) also is incomplete and begins with the 7th adhyāya of the 7th adhi karana and breaks off in the 4th adhyāya of 12th adhikarana. It also refers to the views of its predecessors in the words. &lsquo;kecit&rsquo; &amp;c. ( vide pp. 35, 61, 62, 104, 115, 131, 191 ). It discusses various readings (pp. 136, 183, 188, 193 &amp;c. ).</p>
<p>Dr. Shamasastri includes in his edition 571 sútras attri buted to Canakya. Their relation to the Kautiliya is a subject which requires careful investigation. In my own opinion they are later than the Kautiliya. It would be beyond the scope of this work to enter into details. Vide Dr. Jacobi&rsquo;s article in Indian Historical Quarterly, rol. III., pp. 669-676.</p>
<p>There are several niti collections attributed to Canakya and published several times in different parts of India. All. of them are later than the Kauţiliya and are compilations of maxims and fine sayings. One of them the Canak ya&ndash;rājaniti śāstra ( publisherl in Calcutta Oriental series, 1921, 2nd edi tion ) contains 660 verses and was compiled under Bhojarāja. Several other compilations pass under the names Vpadha Câmakya, Laghu-Cāvakya &amp;c. All these are passed over here from considerations of space and utility.</p>
<p>Dr. Sternbach has devoted much labour and time to the several works published under the name of Canakya. Those interested may read the following: J., A. 0. S. Vol. 76. pp. 115-130 ( Cănakya&rsquo;s aphorisms in the Hitopadeśa pussa ges ), J. A. O. S. Vol. 77 pp. 26-31, 107-115, 166-183 ), J. A. 0. S. Vol. 79, pp. 233-254 ( Māpavadharmasastra verses in Canakya&rsquo;s compendia ), JAOS. Vol. 83, pp. 30-66 ( Mahă bhārata verses in Cânakya&rsquo;s compendia ), ABORI Vol. 37, pp. 58-110, ABORI Vol. 42, pp. 99-122 ( Tibetan Rājaviti Šāstra ), Vishreshvaranada Indological Journal I. pp. 66-77. ( verses from three anthologies examined ).</p>
<p>A few matters may be emphasized here that make the K. A. unique in some respects.</p>
<p>Even in the Vedic age there were high functionaries and officers of state and their names slightly differed in different</p>

<p>Vedic works. Vide H. of Dh. Vol. III, pr. 111-112* for the eleven rutna18 or rutnins ( besides the king ) with reference to the Rājasiya. Later on these functionaries were called Tirthas which are referred to in Sabhpurva V. 38, Ayodhya kända ( 100. 36, Bom. ed., 94. 30 Cr. ed. Baroda ), Santiparva 69. 52. The Arthaśāstra ( I. 12. 6 ) names these and in 1, 12. 20 states that they are 18 in mumber. The Arthassistra not only names the 18 functionaries but also gives a very interest ing classification of these along with their cash salaries per year ( in V. 3). Some of them may be set out here. Acc. to K. A. V. 30. 2 the sacrificial priest, the preceptor (acárya ), minister ( mantrin), the purohita (chaplain), the comman der-in-chief, the Yuvarāja ( crown prince ), the king&rsquo;s mother and tlie crowned queen should receive 48000 ( panas ); the chief palace usher, the chief palace guard, the director of labourers, the gılministrator ( or collector ) of taxes and the Director of stores should receive 24 thousand; the prince&rsquo;s, the mothers of princes, the Nayaka ( commandant of the forces or police in the capital ), the julge (in the capital ), the Director of factories, the council of ministers, the provin cial officer and the officer in charge of the frontiers should l&rsquo;eceive 12000. It would be noticed that the Mantrin (chief minister ), the Purohita, Senapati nel Yuvarāja are among the most important and most highly paid officials of the king, The Purohitu was a very important and honoured person even in the Ryveda. Agni is called Propulitre and revij in the very first verse of the Rgvedu. The Aita reyn-brāhmana says that the Purohita is half the self of the Ksatriva ( the King ) in :34. 8 ( ardhātmo ha vă esa ksatrivasya yuturohitab ) and &lsquo;the goils do not partake of the foorl offered by a king who has no purohita; therefore a king about to offer a sacrifice should choose a brāhmana as purohita&rsquo;s Ait.

The Senapati ( commander-in-chief) held a purely secular office and in II. 3. 33-34 K. states his qualifications, duties and functions, and in X. 3. 45 provides that the Senā pati should acıdress the soldiers of the army after they are made well-disposed by the payment of money and the besto wal of honours and should offer to pay one hundred thousand panus to him who would kill the enemy king, 50 thousand for killing ( in battle ) the Senāpati or prince of the opposing army and lastly by offering double wages and gift of whatever il soldier may seize from the opposing army. It may be noted that K. provides ( in V. 3. 28-29 ) that of those that die on duty the sous and wives shall receive food and wages and their minor children, olid men and sick persons should be shown favour ( should be helped ).</p>

(II. 10. 26. 4-8 ) pro vides that the king should appoint for the protection of the subjects in villages and cities jersons of the first three varnas, pure as to money and truth-loving and the assistants (purusas ) of those also should be possessed of the same virtues and that the king should arrange to guard a city against thieves for one yojan in all directions and a village for a kroza and they should re-imburse what is stolen with. in those limits Kilutilya makes an approach to the welfare state in IV. 3. 1&ndash;2, where he calls upon the king to protect the country from eight great calamities viz, fire, foods, disease (epidemic), famine, rats, wild elephants (and similar animals ), serpents and evil spirits (or demons) and he provides reme dies for these and arlds that in all such cases the king should favour the afflicted (people ) like a father (sarvatra copa hatán pitevānugļhniyat ). The Dharmasūtras and Smrtis also mention certain persons as not liable to pay taxes223 e. g. 22337**: 14. 17aquiat a fia: 1 SAT2128 019 auta: 1917</p>

<p>Another striking matter is K&rsquo;s references to confederacies of oligarchic or republican Slates ( in the 11th Adhikarana about sanghus, which covers less than three printed pages ). He states ( XI. 1. 1-3) securing an oligarchy on one&rsquo;s side is better than securing an ariny or an ally; for sanghas being well-kuit become unassailable by enemies. Those ( sanghas.) that are friendly should be won over by ( a policy of) con ciliation and gifts, while those that are hostile ( should be dealt with ) by ( sowing ) disseusions (among them ) and by force. Then K. inentions two clusses of oligarchies (X1. 1. 4-5 ).224 One class of Sanghas existed in the countries of Kamboja and Surăstra and there were corporations of Ksatri yas also; all these maintained themselves ordinarily by igri. culture, trade and the profession of arms, while there were other sanghas vix.

A. in VIII. 3. 62-64 ) remarks that of the vices of gambliny and drinkiny, gambling is worse and that particularly, in the case of sigla and royal families, that the characteristics of a saigha viz. dissensions are caused by Gambling that lead to destructions; bence gambling is the greatest amony vices since it leads to weakness in governing</p>
<p>It is noteworthy that in the passage quoted in the foot. note about sanghas ( oligarchies ), K. I. separately mentions the Licchavikas and Vrjikas as saigh13, while some modern writers such as Dr. U. N. Ghoshal (p. 1 of his address in 1983 as President of the Asiatic Society of Bengal ) treut them as identical. Rhys Davids in &lsquo;Buddhist Iudia&rsquo; (pp.19-26) suininarises the data about Indian Republics derived froin Buddhist works and points out that the Vajjians ( Vrjikas of K. A.) had eight confeilerite clans of which the Licchavis and the Videhas were inost important. The word śreni ( found in K. A. ) is very ancient, occurring as it does frequently in the sense of gronp, row, Hock&rsquo;even in the Ryverla (e. g. in 1. 163. 10, III. 8.9) and gana' occurs dozens of times in the Rg. The word saigla' is mentioned frequently by Panini (in III. 3. 86 in the sense of gana'), V. 2. 52, V. 3. 114 ( referring to Ayudhajivi.-5a ghas' among Vähikas ). In V. 3. 115-117 Pånini inentions several Ayudha-jivisanghas such as Värkenyah or Vrkāḥ, Piraśavah ( singular ) or Parśavah (plural), Yandheyah (or Yaudheyāh in V. 3. 117 ). In I. 6. 10 K. A. reports that the saigha of the Vranis perished by their foolhardiness in trying to assail Drai pāyaua. The Maläbhārata does not mention the attack on Dyaipāyana. The Mahabharata states that the Yådavas included Vrouis, Andhakas, Bhojas ( Mausala parva I. 14 ) and also Kukuras ( Mausala 5. 2), Mausala (chap. 3 ) shows that Yüdavas fought ainong themselves and perished. In Sünti 81. 25 Kinna is said to be the chief ( President ) of the Sangha of Vrsnis and in the Bhagavad-gita Kina is identi fied with Väsudeva of the Vrsnis. In Santi 107 there is an interesting discussion as to the causes of the destruction of the Sanglas and Ganas.

<p>Another distinctive feature of K&rsquo;s work is the division of the urdministration into two branches, viz. the rural area (junc pullie ) and the Duryi ( cepitil or urban area ) each with distinct officers and duties. The tirst was in charge of the Sunshartr and the Pradestr ( K. A. II. 6 and 35, IV.1.1) and the urbau area ( Durm) under the Näyuriku335 (city Superintendent ) as stated in K. A.

<p>*In the B. I. edition (1884) of the Kämundakiya-uitisára by Rajendrala! Mitra with a com. compiled by three Pandits the word Kautalya is explained as follows: &lsquo;Kutu&rsquo; means &lsquo;ghata&rsquo;: ( with affix lic) Kitala&rsquo; means one who stores only as much coru as fills a jar and Kautalya would mean a descendant of such a person.386 The learned editor of the Arthasāstra in the Trivandrum series, N. M. Ganapati Sastri accepts this (Intro. p. 4 ) and the only authority he cites for Kuutaly&rsquo;u as a gotra naine is that of a very late lexicon called Nünürthårnavasa iksepa of Kesavasvämnin. It is remarkable that the learned Mabamahopadhyaya prints the wame of the work as Kauţiliyam and in the opening verse of his commentary also keeps the word Kauţiliya and in the first sentence ( of the coin). also prints the author&rsquo;s name as Kautilya, on p. 23 in the last verse of the first chapter he reads &ldquo;Kautilyena krtam śāstram', again on p. 27 he prints' catasra eva vidya iti Kautilyah', on p. 33.neti Kautilyah' and on p. 39' Artha eve pradhāna iti Kautilyah'. It is difficult to believe that the great Mahama. hopadhyaya, who had till then editel 80 works and who bad two mss. of the work in Tamil characters and one in Telugu characters, printed the author&rsquo;s name as Kautilya by sheer carelessness (unuvudhand, as he states in his Sanskrit In troduction ).

<p>1.4. The Arthrostro of Kautilya</p>
<p>255</p>
<p>careless aud writes the word as Kautilya many times instead of Kautalya (which his three mss. supported as he says ) it is easy to believe that some later scribes purposely changed the word or carelessly wrote it as Kautalya. The form Kautalya makes its appearance in some works and inscriptions after the Ilth or 12th century A. D. This was probably due to later writers' unwillingness to hold that the great Canakya who helped Candragupta to drive away the Greeks from India and wrote an excellent work on Politics should have borne such an opprobrious name as Kautilya. But the word Kautalya makes hardly any sense. Manu (IV. 7-8) recommends that Brāhmaṇas should not amass wealth, should not have more corn than what is contained in a granary of bricks or that they should be kumbhidhanya or possess only as much grain as would suffice for three days ( for the family and servants ) or only for one day. Yāj. ( I. 124 and 128 ) provides that a good brāhmana shonld have only as much stock of grains as would suffice for one year ( for family &amp;c) and should not go in for a Soma sacrifice if he has less or should have as much grain as would be contained in a granary or contained in a Kumbhi or as would last for three days or one day. These ancient smytis (Manu IV. 8, YĂj. I. 128) provide that the more penurious a brāhmaya is the more lie becomes praiseworthy or should be more honoured. The commentators differ about the meaning of Kusüladhânya and Kumbhi-dhanya (vide Kullūka on Manu IV. 7). Kumbhidhảnya means either one who has in store as much corn as would last for six months (Medhătithi ) or as would last for six days (Govindarāja ). But no ove uses the word kutadhanvah or chatadhânyah. Kumbhi is a technical word in Manu and YÂj. Therefore, to take lutule as Kumbhidhánya is not only far-fetched but unwarranted. Besides, the Puranas ( e. g. Matsya and Váyu), Båna bhatta, Mudrārāksusa, and Bhavabhūti ( who employs' the words- Kutila-Daya-nisnăta manasām') point to Kautilya as the name and no one has shown that Kautalya occurs in early Inscriptions (though Kautilya occurs as a gotra in early inscriptions from the 7th century A. D. ). Vide Danda viveka of Vardhamāna Pp. 134-135 for a discussion of the meaning of Kumbha ( it winds up by saying &lsquo;nánärtha em Kumbhaśabdaḥ)&rsquo;.</p>

<p>Asvastana&rsquo;i. e. storing only as much corn as would suffice for a day or he may follow the way of Kapota birds and that each one of these ways is superior to each preceding one. The Manusmrti (IV. 7-8) mentions four ways of living for a brāhmana viz. Kusüladhānya, Kumbhidhânya, Tryahaihiku (one storing only as much corn as would suffice for three days for the family and servants) or he may be asvastanika' (not storiny even for the next day ). The Manu-smrti (in IV. 4-6, states that a brāhmana householder may follow for his livelihood the method of rta (i. e. collecting with his fingers grains that have fallen down in a field or on a public way or collecting the fallen pods of grain ) or the method amrtı ( grain yot without asking ) or of mito ( collecting alms by begging) or of premrta, ( method of agriculture ) or by sutyan rton (i.e. traile); but a brahmana should not follow Svavrtti ( doy&rsquo;s way i. e. serving or labouring for another). Visvarūpa on Yâj. I. 127 ( where also the words Kusuladhanya and Kumbhidhānya are used ) explains that&rdquo; kusüla means Kosthaka and is a measure for corn equal to twenty drons and Kumbhi is half of that and quotes a half verse ( Daśadroni smrtā Kumbhi Kusūlo dvi gunastataḥ, ityabhiyuktopadeśāt ). (In VIII. 3-20) Manu provides the punishment of vudha (either whipping, cutting of a limb or death ) as the punishment for a thief who steals more corn than ten Kumbhis. Viśvarūpia on Yaj. I. 127 (Vol. 1 p. 104 of T. S. S.) explains that Kusula is Kosthaka and is a measure of corn equal to twenty dronas and Kumbhi is half of that and quotes a verse ( Daśa dronäh smộtá Kumbbi Kusūlo dvigunastatah ). Ksirasvāmin on Amarakosa men tions Kudava, Prastha, ĀŅhaka, Droưa and Khāri as measures, parimāras ), quotes a verse, stating four Palas are equal to Kudava, four Kudavas are equal to prastha, four prasthas are equal to ūdhaka, cight ādhakas are equal to droņa and the quantities of these measures differ in different countries i. e. in some countries four ādhakus are equal to drona and twenty dronas inake a Kumbha. The Mit. on Yāj. III. 265 quotes Manu VIII. 320 and remarks that Kumbha is equal to five thousand pular. A Kumbha or Kumbhi was a large measure in any case and not a mere jar, as M. M. Ganapatisastri says without any autlalarity Therefore, from kuța (a jar), one cannot jump to the condinsion that kutala would mean Kumbhidhinya or Kumbhadham</p>

<p>Mahadeva in his commentary called Vaijayanti ( Anandā srama ed.) on the Satyasādha Franta sūtra speaks of six Srauta Sutras of the Black Yajurveda viz. Baudhāyana, Bharadvāja , Āpastamba, Hiranyakešin, Vädhūla and Vaikhā nasa, and frequently cites passages from the Vaikhānasa srautasūtra. In the Carana vyūlia of Saunaka, Vàdhūla and Vaikhanasa are not mentioned. But that Vaikhānasa was a very ancient writer follows from the references contained in the ancient dharma works. In Gautaina the word Vaikha nasa' occurs (Dh. S. III. 2) as the name for the order of forest hermits ( Vivaprastha ) and in another Sūtra (III. 26 ) he lays down that fire was to be consecrated according to the Srāmaņaka,227 which latter is explained by Haradatta as Vaiklānasa Sāstra. Baudhayana (Dh. S. II. 6. 17 ) has the same Sūtra228 and defines a Vaikhanaga as one who follows the rules of conduct laid down in Viikhānasa sastra (Dh. S. II. 6. 16 ). The Vasistha Dh. S. (9. 10 ) also has the same sūtra as Gautama (Dh. S. III. 26). The Manusmrti (VI. 21) speaks of the Vänajrastha as one who abiiles by the views of Vaikhānasa ( Vaikhānasamate sthital ). Gau. III. 25-34 and Vas. IX. 1-11 deal with Vaikhannsa. Printed Gaut. III. 26 reads &lsquo;śravanakenägnimñdhāya&rsquo; while Vas. IX. 10 hus' sra manakenăgnimūdhāyāhitāgnili syāt'.</p>

<p>smrti ( VI. 1-32 ) deals at length with the stage of Vånapra stha or Vaikhānasa. From Manu VI. 21 it follows that a šāstra called Vaikhanasa was known to the Manusmrti. Kalpataru ( Brahmacārio p. 268 ) quotes a long passage from Hārīta Dharmasūtra, which says that four asramas are a ladder by which gods and the pitre reached immortality (saisā śramanisrenir-yayā devāh sva pitarascāmitatvam agacchan)?. Maskaribhāsya on Gaut. Dh, S. (III, 2) explains · Vikhānasă proktam sāstram Vaikhānasam tadvidhinā vartata iti Vaikha nasah&rsquo; and quotes an interesting prose passage from Ušanas &lsquo;Dvau brahmacārinā upakurváno naisthikas-ca dvau Vaikhă nasau sapatniko vipatnīkasceti, dvau sannyásinau bhiksu&ndash; sannyāsi vedasannyāsi ceti, bahudhā grhasthāh sālina-yāyā varādibhedenaSrāmanaka is probably derived from the word &lsquo;Sramana&rsquo; that is found in Bỉ. Up. IV. 3. 22, which describes the state of a person who has realized the Highest Self. He is then above and beyond all the ordinary relations of life, such as, if he was a sramana before, he becomes aśramana or if he was a tiposu he becomes devoid of that state &amp;c. Vide Tai. Ar. II. 7. 1 and · Kumārah sramanādi. bhih&rsquo; Panini II. 1. 70. Vaikhănasa is forined from the word Vikhanas.</p>
<p>The Vaikhānasadharmapraśna is divided into three pras nas, each praśna being subdivided into khandas. There are in all 41 khandas. The work is a small one. The contents of the work are :-). the four wrnols and their privileges, and the four āśrumas ; duties of brahmacarin; four kinds of brah macūrins ; duties of the householder; four kinds of grhastha, vārtāvrtti ( subsisting by agriculture ), sāliva, yāyāvara and ghorācārika; forest anchorites; vānaprasthas are either sapat nika ( accompanied by their wives ) or apatnika (not so acco mpanied ); Saputnika are of four sorts, Audumbara, Vairiñca, Válakhilya and Phenapa; apatnīka Vāna prasthas; four kinds of bhiksus, viz. kuticaka, bahūdaka, hamsa and parama hamsa; sakāma (performed with desire of wordly gain ) and nişkāma (not so performed ) kurma; pravrtti and nivștti; three kinds of Yogins and their sub-divisions ; II. the details of the grāmanaka rites of the vānaprastha ( khandas 1-4); duties of the forest hermit; details of joining the order of saṁnyāsins ( khandas 6-8); age for samnyāsa ( above seventy or when childless or widower); every day duties and obiger vances of samnyāsins; about ācumana and sandhyā; sa Mare</p>

<p>The Vaikbinasadharmapraśna appears by its style and its contents to be a work of comparatively later date than the dharmasūtras of Gautama and Baudbāyana. It is probably a recast of older materials. It contains the names of more mixed castes than the dharmasútras and than even some of the later smrtis. The present work seems to have been either written or retouched by u devotee of Visųu. Faith in and devotion to Visņu or Nirāyana looms very large here (I. 5. 5 vārāyana parāyaṇāh, I. 7.6 and 9; II. 4-5 bhaktyű Visnum dhyāyan, III. 7.3; Nárayanaparam brahmeti brutah, (IIH 9.3 Visno rălayapārsve). It speaks of the eight angas of Yoga ( I. 10. 9 ), of the Ayurveda with its eight anges and of some treatise on evil spirits ( bhūtatantra III. 12. 7). It refers to the views of some in the word &lsquo;eke&rsquo; (1. 7. 4. and II. 9. 10). It speaks of the Srāmanaka fire (in I. 6.2 and I. 7. 3-4).

In the grhya a reference to Budhavára occurs. &quot; It is worthy of notice that the Vaikhanaga-gshya (II. 12. 1-2, Caland&rsquo;s ed. p. 30 ) men tions Budhavāra in &lsquo;Athāsādhopákarma kuryūt lāpuryamāna Pakse rikti-parvari varjayitvă Budhavāre tithim gļhụāti &lsquo;, and that fifty ūbutis are offered to Agni, the Earth, the four Vedas &amp;c. and among others to Savitri, Prajāpati, Usanas, Cyavana, Bșhaspati, Angiras, Saikha, Likhita.</p>

<p>image of Vinnu should be established in the house and wor ship should be offered to it in the morning and evening every day after homa. Further, the Grhya in IV. 13 provides for gruhusārti, since the proper functioning of the world depends on gruhus. They are mentioned in the same order as in Yāj. I. 295 and the procedure, though similar to that in Yāj. I. 295-308, is more elaborate on some points. For example, it refers (IV. 14 ) to the classification of naksatras into janma, karma, sárghātika, sämudāyika and vainasika, which is not found in Yāj. but occurs in Yogayatră of Varaha mihira. Vide H. of Dh. Vol. V. part 1 p. 529, notes 762-63.</p>
<p>Dr. Caland in his paper on Vaikhanasasūtra holds that the Manusmrti borrows from Vaikhānasagrhya and that the author of the latter was saturated with the idiom of Dravi :dian languages ( vide Prof. Keith&rsquo;s review in Bulletin of tbe School of Oriental Studies, 1927, p. 623 ). Dr. Caland&rsquo;s view about Manu is entirely wrong as will appear froin the section on Manu. Vide Th. Bloch in über das Grhya-und Dharma sūtra der Vaikhūnasa&rsquo;( Leipzig, 1896). &hellip; Dr. Çaland ( Intro. pp. XVI-XIX) put forward certain parallelisms between the Manusmrti and the Vaikhinasa smārta-sútra. They are so flimsy that no serious notice need be taken of them and no acceptable conclusions can be based on them. Dr. Ergers published in 1929 ( at Gottingen ) his work Das Dharmasūtra des Vaikhānasa&rsquo;, which was reviewed in J. R. A. S. for 1929 pp. 916-918. Looking to all that has been stated above the extant Vaik. Grhya-sūtra and Dharma-sūtra are later than Yüj. and may be assigned to about 300 to 100 A. D. Vide Dr. Caland&rsquo;s Intro. to the translation of the Smārtasūtra pp. XV ff.</p>
<p>Other Sutra Works on Dharma It will be proper to say a few words about some other sūtra works on dharma that are only available in mss. or are to be reconstructed from quotations in the digests. It is by no means to be supposed that these works that will be spoken of here were composed as early as those of Gautama, Anasta mba and others or&rsquo;were composed before the extant Manu and Yajňavalkya. But as the chronology of all ancient works on dharma is somewhat in a nebulous state, it is best to Weat here of all works, written in the sūtra style, even though</p>

<li>Atri That Atri was an ancient writer on hurma follows from &amp; reference to him in Manu (III. 16 ) as holding the view that a crijati taking as wife a südra woman became fallen (patita). In the Deccan College collection there are several mss. ( Nos. 185-187 of A 1881-82 ) of the Atreyadharmaśāstra in nine adhyayas. They trent of gifts, prayers (japya ) and tupus by which men are free from all sins. Some of the chapters are in mixed prose and verse. The first three chapters are entirely in verse and some of the verses (such as ekāksaram param brabma) occur in the Manusmști. The fourth opens with a long sūtra, which, in style, resembles later bbāsyas and com mentaries, 320 The 5th also is in verse and contains several verses found in Viisistha ( Dh. S. 28. 1, 4, 6). The sixth speaks of the specially boly hymns and verses of the Veda. Some of the verses here are the same as Vasistha ( 28. 10–11). &ldquo;The seventh refers to secret prayascittas and the very first sūtra after the opening words sj.eaks of several non-Aryan tribes 230 such as the Sakas, Yavanas, kambhojus, Balbikas, Khusus, Vangus aud Pärasu ( Persians ? ) &amp;c. It is to be noted that the saine sutra ( with slight variations ) is quoted as Atri&rsquo;s by Apariirka (on Ynj. III. 266 p. 1123). The 7th aud 8th chapters are in inixed prose and verse. The 9th is in verse and speaks of Yoya and its unyus. It refers to the fact that Sisupūlu, son of Damaghosa, because in his hatred of Govinda he always thought of the latter, went to heaven. The same sutra work is noticed in I. O. Cat., pp. 380-81, Nos. 1305 and 1306.</li>

<p>History of Dharmaśāstra</p>
<p>There are several works styled Atri-smrti or samhită in the mss. One of them is in six chapters on secret prāyścittas, gifts, pitřmedha and ācāra ( vide I. O. Cat., p. 381, No. 1308). There is another work styled Atrisaṁhită printed in Jivanau da&rsquo;s collection (part I. pp. 13-46). It contains about 400 verses and deals with the following topics :- importance of honouring guru; duties of four castes; purifications of seveaal mnulus ; virtues of Brāhmanas such as saucu, anusīyā; defini tion of işta and pūrta, ten yamas and niyamas; importance of sons; adopted sons; prāyaścittas for taking forbidden food or drink and for other transgressions ; impurity on birth and death; căndrāyana, Kłchra, Sānta pana ; gifts ; purifications from avoidable contacts with rajasvalā &amp;c. ; Srāddha and the brābmaņas to be invited for it.</p>
<p>In this work Atri is himself cited as an authority. Other authors and works quoted are: Apastam ba ( p. 30), Yama (p. 41 ), Vyāsa ( p. 24 ), Sankha ( pp. 22, 35), Sätätapa (p. 35). The Vedānta, Särikhya, Yoga, Puraụas, Bhagavatāḥ (p. 45 ) are mentioned. It contains (on p. 14) the verse &lsquo;sadyaḥ patati mānsena&rsquo; which is found in Vasistha Dh. S. (2.27) with the words &lsquo;athāpyudābaranti&rsquo;. There are other verses also which occur elsewhere e. g.&lsquo;atha cen-mantravid&rsquo; occurs in Vasistha 11. 20, &lsquo;tryaham prātah&rsquo; (p.23 ) is ulso Manu XI. 211. On p. 26 occur the words &lsquo;utrāpyudāharanti’and so what follows is a quotation. On p. 32 there are three verses in another metre.</p>
<p>Atri’s verse about adoption 31 is quoted as the first autho rity on adoption in the Dattakamimäinsa. He mentions the seven urtyajas to be the washerman, the shoemaker, natu, buruda, kaivarta (fisherman ), meda and bhilla (p. 29). He further says232 that there is no question of untouchability in fairs, marriage seasons, in Vedic sacrifices and in all festivals. He says that Brāhmaṇas from Magadha, Mathurā and three other places are not honoured ( at a śrăddha) though as lear ned as Bịhaspati.283 231 zgatal adem: gaasaiara: Ti frost. ETHITH Ra: 11</p>

<p>The work mentions the signs of the Zodiac, Kanyå and the Scorpiou (1&quot;43 ), and hence was not composed before the first centuries of the Christian era.</p>
<p>In Jivananda there is a Laghu-Atri (part I, pp. 1-12 ) in 6 chapters and about 120 verses, dealing with the means of being freed from gins (such as prānīyāma, sucred formula, gifts &amp;c. ), with purifications from impurity on death and birth, with gifts. It mentions Manu. In the fourth chapter there are about ten lines in proge. There are numerous verses that occur also in the Vasistha-dharmasútra, e. g. Vas. 26. 8-9 and 16-18 occur on p. 3 ; Vas. 28. 11.16 occur on pp. 4-5. It is difficult to say who the borrower is.</p>
<p>There is a Vrddhatreyasmrti in Jivananda (part I. pp. 47-59 ) in five chapters and about 140 verses. This closely resembles the Laghu-Atri-smrti described above. In the commencement both have the same six verses beginning with</p>
<p>bhagavan kena dānena&rsquo; and the works have many verses in common. In the fourth chapter of both the same prose passa ges occur.</p>
<p>Visvarūpa on Yāj. (III. 257 ) quotes two verses from Atri on prāyaścitta which are found in none of the three works described above. 234</p>
<p>In the Mahabharata (Anušāsana 65. 1 ) Atri is credited with the view that those who make a gift of gold give (prac tically) all objects. This bears a close resemblance to two verses that occur in Laghvatri (Jivananda part I. p. 5) and Vțddhātri (part I. p. 51 ).235</p>

<p>That Ušanas wrote a work on politics follows from seve ral circumstances. The Kauţiliya quotes the Auśanasāļı seven times. It is almost certainly referring to a work.

In other places also we have a Nitiśästra ascribed to Bhargava ( Sānti. 210. 20 ) and certain verses are ascribed to him (Santi. 57. 40-41 and 139. 70-71). The Anušāsana-parva ( 139. 8-9) states. The Sāstras known to Uśanas and Bșhaspati cannot surpass the (innate ) intelligence of women; how can men guard them (completely ). This verse occurs in Pancatantra (B. S. S. ed. of 1873 p. 41 and Hertel&rsquo;s ed. p. 30 ). Bhārgava is said to be the first expounder of Nitiśāstra in Santi. 210. 20. Two verses from Säntiparva, chap. 138. 113 and 139. 71 are interesting as having been declared hy Usanas to Prahlada viz.237 those that confide in persons who were once inimical are destroyed by the latter and that one should proceed cautiously even after making an alliance ( sandhi). The Adiparva ( 76. 6 ) says that KĀvya was the purohitu of the asuras. The Salyaparva ( 39. 6 ) says that Kõvya performed austerities at Kajalamocanatirtha and the whole science of Niti ( Rājaniti ) appeared to him. The Udyogaparva states that everyone except Bhargava follows the wrong niti ( 39. 30). The Sintiparva (210. 20 ) states that Bhargava expounded Nitiśāstra which is beneficial to the world and Santi ( 289. Ch. ed.) explains how Uśanas came to be called Sukra. Vide under Arthasästra of Kautilya ' for further information. The Nitiprakāśikā of Janamejaya refers to &amp; succession of teachers of politics from Brahmā</p>

Visvarūpa (on Yaj. I. 307 ) asks the king to appo int ministers in accordance with the views propounded in the śāstras of Bphaspati and Ušanas and quotes a long passage in prose from Bșhaspati in which the sāstras of Manu, Bșhaspati and Uśanas are joined together.

<p>The work is a brief one ( 8 folios ) in seven adhyāyas. Their contents are:- II. impurity on birth and death; purification of certain things in certain ways such as with water, ashies &amp;c. III. the four varvas and the mixed castes such as Rathakāra, Ambastha, Sūta, Ugra, Māgalha &amp;c., the Vrātyas ; IV. no bodily injury to be done to brahmana; prāyascittas for killing a brāhmaṇa or a man of the other varnas and for other Mahā pātakas, prāyaścitta for eating the flesh of certain animals and for eating plants like garlic, prāyaścitta for adultery ; discussion whether a Brāhmana could marry a śūdra woman; prāyaścittas for killing various beasts and birds ; fourteen vidyās; V. šrūddhrakalpa; what Brāhmaṇas are punkti pāvuna; details of śrāddha; food and flesh at śrāddha; who are unfit to be invited at śrāddha; VI. what things a Brāhmaṇa could not sell; VII. punishments for the Maha pātakas; what are pure things at all times. Some of the views of the Auśanasa-dharmaśāstra are worth special notice. The son of a Brāhmana, Ksatriya or Vaisya from a wife, of the varụa immediately next to it belonged to the caste of the father.340 No sin or punishment attached to ope if one killed an atatāyi (armed) Brāhmana. The fourteen vidyās are said to be the six ungas and the four Vedas, Mimiņsā, Nyāya, Dharmaśāstra and Purana.241</p>
<p>The work very often quotes the views of others with the words &lsquo;eke&rsquo;; for example it says &lsquo;the impurity on birth is ten nights for the parents of the child, but according to sume only for the mother.&rsquo; 242 The son of a Brāhmana from a sūdra woman is called pārasava, but according to some he is nisāda. The whole of the portion in the ms. about the mixed castes bears a very close resemblance to Baudhāyana (Dh. S. 1. 9)</p>

<p>There are about 45 verses in the work, the 7th and last chapter being almost entirely in verse. As the mss. are corrupt and full of gaps, it is often difficult to find out whether a particular passage is prose or verse. In several verses the words Manur abravid' occur and in one place &lsquo;tan manor anusāsanam : 214 The latter closely agrees with Manu. Several verses are common to Manu and Usanas. The verse &lsquo;gurutalpe bhagaḥ kāryaḥ&rsquo; (Manu 9. 237) occurs in the ms. So also the verse &ldquo;yena yena cidangena&rsquo; occurs in both.245 The words of Manu (V.78 ) &lsquo;bāle deśāntarasthe&rsquo; are expressly quoted with the words &lsquo;Manur-āha&rsquo;. There are many other verses which, though not cited expressly as from a particular author, are found in other ancient works. For example, the verse &lsquo;āpaḥ śuddhā bhūmiyatäh&rsquo; is Manu 5. 128 and Baud. Db. $. I. 5, 57. The half versekāruhastaḥ sucir nityam' is Manu 5. 126 and Baud. Dh. S. 1. 5. 48. The verse &lsquo;yadekarātrena karoti pāpam&rsquo; occurs in Ap. Dh. S. ( I. 9. 27. 11 ) and Baud. Dh. S II. 1. 42. The verse &lsquo;tryaham prātas tryaham naktam &lsquo;is Manu XI. 211. It is a remarkable fact that some of the verses in this dharmasūtra agree closely with the verses in the Uśanas&ndash;smrti in verse, published by Jivananda ; e. g. the verse &lsquo;dattvå tu Vedānatyartham&rsquo;occurs on p. 525 and the verse &lsquo;nimantritustu yo vipro adhyānam samprapadyate&rsquo; on p. 527.

<p>close resemblance to the versified smrti on many points, e. g. the prose passages about the duration of the satisfaction of the Manes by the offerings of the flesh of various animals occur almost in the same words in the versified smrti of USanas (Jivananda, part I, p. 522 ).</p>
<p>The Auśanasa-dharmasūtra contains several passages in prose which are the same as some verses in Manu.246 The sūtra quotes in one place the divergent views of Vasistha,247 Harita, Saunaka, and Gautama on the question whether a brāhmana could marry a śūdra woman. The view of Vasiştha (as quoted in the ms.) is that a Brāhmaṇa could take to wife girls of all the four castes, but in the printed text of Vasistha ( I. 24 ) a Brāhmana is allowed to marry girls of three higher castes only. It is possible that the ancient reading of Vasistha&rsquo;s text was &lsquo;catasral&rsquo; (as quoted in the Auśånasa ) which was changed into &lsquo;tisrah&rsquo;. The passage reminds us of Manu III. 16 (Sudrāvedi patatyatreh ), but the views ascribed to Suunaka and Gautama in the ms. differ from those ascribed to thein in Manu. In another passage Vasistha&rsquo;s views seem to be quoted.48</p>

<p>History of Dharmaśāstra</p>
<p>dharma viz. ācāra, vyavahāra and prayascitta. For example, the Smộticandrikā quotes prose passages of Uśanas on anadhyāya (1, p. 59), on duntadhavana (1. p. 106 ) and Haradatta quotes a prose passage on anadhyāya (on Ap. Dh. S. I. 3. 10. I) and a prose passage on the fine for a Kşatriya abusing a sūdra (on Gau. Dh. S. 12. 10) and on Niyoga ) on Gau. Dh. S. 18. 5). These passages are not found in the ms. But there are others that are found. For example, the Smộticandrikā quotes two passages, which occur in the mss.249 It appears therefore that the mss. either contain a portion only of the complete Auśanasa-dharma-sūtra or an independent sūtra work. The former alternative looks more probable. The foregoing discussion has shown that the sutra work is later than the dharmasūtras of Gautaina and Vasistha and also than the Manusmrti, which it probably knew in a very ancient version slightly differing from the extant one.</p>
<p>In Jivananda&rsquo;s collection of smộtis there is an Aušanasa dharmaśāstra in 51 verses (part I. pp. 497-501 ). It deals with mixed castes and their avocations, such as sūta, māgadha: dāpņāla, $vapaca, pulinda-&amp;c. The same work occurs in the Anandāśrama collection, pp. 46-48. The Mit. (on Yaj. 1. 94 ) remarks that the means of livelihood for the mixed custes should be sought for in the works of Usanas and Manu.280 It is probably this smộti that is meant. Kullūka on Manu. X. 49 says that the sale of hides and working on hides were means of livelihood for Dhigvaņas according to the Aušanasa.</p>
<p>In the same collection (part I. pp. 501-544 ) there is another smộti ascribed to Usapas in 9 chapters and about 600 verses. It treats of Upanayana, daily observances like ācamuna, Vedic study, occasions of unadhyāya, the dharmas of snātuka ; śrāddha, proper Brāhmaṇas for brāddha, impurity on birth and death, rites after death, prayascittas for the mortal sins and lesser sins.</p>

<p>This smrti quotes Usanas himself, also Manu, Bhrgu (Bhrguputra III ), Prajapati and speaks of dharmaśāstras, Puranas, Mimārsā, Vedanta, Pāñcarătras, Kāpālikas and Pāśupatas. Numerous verses from the Manusmộti are found in it (e. g. Manu II. 42, 49, 50, 125 ) and occur in the first chapter alone. There is a brief prose passage towards the end of the 9th chapter. It speaks of Kāpālikas, Pāśupatas and atheists together ( 1). 525 ).</p>
<p>None of these smộtis in verse contains the passages in verse on vyavahāra ascribel to Ušauas that occur in the Mitākṣarā, Smrticandrikā and other works.</p>
<p>The Mit. (on Yāj. III. 260 ) and Aparārka (e. g. p. 158, 192, 255 ) contain prose passages ascribed to Usanas and the same works contain numerous verses ascribed to Usanas, most of which are not found in the two smrtis in Jivananda. Some of the verses in Apararka ascribed to Ušanas are found in the Aušanasasmrti (e. g. Aparūrka p. 418 &lsquo;kuryād-abaraḥ śrād dham’is Jivananda I. p. 521 ).</p>
<p>In other cases the verses quoted from Ušanas in Aparā rka, though not quite identical, bear a very close resemblance (e. g. the four verses in Aparărka on p. 450 closely resemble Jivananda I, p. 525 and have some verses in common ).</p>
<p>Among the views on Vyavahăra quoted from Ugapas are some interesting ones. It was he who said that a son was not bound to pay his father&rsquo;s debt, if it was a fine or unpaid toll or what is not vyāvahārika.261 He holds that even blind, deaf or old men, women, minors could be witnesses in charges of sākasa ( Aparārka p. 671). He is quoted also on ordeals, on svāmipāla vivāda and on steya.</p>
<p>Ušanas is quoted in Kalpataru (Grhastha kāņda ) 8 times, in Srāddha 13 times (8 times in prose ), in Vyavahāra eleven times (all verses, except one proge passage on p. 814 on anuloma unions ), 6 times in Niyatakāla.</p>

<p>a ksatriya from a vaibya wife is a kşatriya (p. 814 on Vyava hāra ). Aparārka quotes Ušanas dozens of times, about nine quotations being in prose ( most of them on prāyaścitta ).</p>

<p>A work styled Sukranitisāra was edited by Oppert (Madras 1882 ) and by Jivananda (Cal. 1892 ) and translated by Benoy Kumar Sarkar in S. B. H. Series. That work is a very interesting one, but is comparatively of a late date.</p>
<p>It is probable that at least some parts of Sukranitisira edited by Oppert in 1882 are not older than about 1800 A. D. (viz, such as IV. 5. II prescribing fees for lawyers ). Vide Mr. Lallanji Gopal&rsquo;s paper in the Bulletin of the London School of Oriental and African Studies, Vol. 25 for 1962 pp. 524-556, in which it is strenously urged that it is a fabrica tion of the 19th century). I do not agree that the whole work is later than 1800 A. D. The Sukranitisāra provides on p. 157 ( of Oppert&rsquo;s ed. ).

<p>Such passages may be interpolations made in the first quarter of the 19th century. In the year 1793 the Governer General&ndash;in-Council enacted Regulation VII of 1793 in order to induce men of education and character to take up the practice of law as a distinct profession. That Regulation applied only to the provinces of Bengal, Bihar and Orissa. In 1802 Regu lation XIV of 1802 was enacted in Bombay which consisted of 33 sections providing among other matters for the appo intment of pleaders, for the issue of sanads to them, for remuneration payable to them and for penalties in cases of misconduct or negligence.</p>

<li>Kanya and Känva From the Ap. Dh. S. it appears that Kanva and Kāụva were two distinct writers on dharma. In I. 6. 19. 2 Āpastamba starts the question as to the persons, food at whose house was permitted. He states various views on that point and says that Kanya was of opinion that food may be taken at anybody&rsquo;s house provided the latter offered it with a request (I. 6. 19. 3) and that the opinion of Eka, Kuņika, Kānva, Kutsa and Puskarasäili (1. 6. 19. 7) was that only that food that was offered by a pure and religious man should be partaken. In another place ( L. 10. 28. 1) Apastambé gives it as the opinion of Kautsa, Härīta, Kajıva and Puskara sādi that a man became a thief if in any case whatever he appropriates another&rsquo;s belongings. The Kumbhakonam edition of Pandit Halasyanatha reads Kāņva for Kanva.</li>
</ol>
<p>Kanva is quoted a few times in the Smyticandrika on Ahnika ( daily duties ) and śrāddha. One of these quotations is in prose ( I. p. 97 ).252 Haradatta in his commentary on Gautama cites verses of Kanva in several places (e. g. Guu tama Dh. S, 21. 3, 23. 3 and 11 ).253 The first verse bears &amp; close resemblance to Manu XI. 180 and Baud. Dh. S. II. 1. 62. Kanva is quoted in the Acaramayukha and the Srāddha mayūkha.</p>
<p>The Mit. (on Yāj. III. 58 ) quotes a verse of Kūņva on the length of the stay of a saimyāsin in a village or town. On Yāj. I11. 260 the Mit. quotes a verse of Kanva stating the prāyascitta for a brālimana having intercourse with the kșatriya wise of his teacher.</p>
<p>In the Madras Govt. Oriental Library there is a mo. of Kanva (vol. V, p. 1929 No. 2624 ).</p>
<p>Maskarin on Gaut. Dh. S. frequently quotes passages from Kanva (in prose and verse); vide on I. 33 and 39 ( both prose), V. 21 (prose definition of Vedapāraga ), IX. 1 (prose), X. 53 (verse on five kinds of bräddhas, nitya, naimittika,</p>

<li>Kasyapa and Kasyapa Baudhayana ( Dh. S. I. 11. 20) cites a verse which con tains the view of Kaśyapa that a woman who is bought can. not be a patnī and that she is not authorised to take part in religious ( daiva ) rites or rites for the Manes.254 This verse is ascribed to Katyayana in the Smrticandrika ( I. p. 87 ). The Vanaparva quotes gāthcs of Kāśyapa on forbearance ( 29. 35-40). Whether Kaśyapa and Kāśyapa are two different writers of dharmasútras it is rather difficult to say. Probably they are identical. It appears that the dharmasútra of Kāśyapa comprised all the usual topics of dharmasūtras, such as daily duties, sraddha, asauca, prayascitta. This sutra has been quoted by all eminent writers from Visvarūpa down wards. Visvarāpa quotes Kasyapa (in prose ) on the priya scitta for contact with candila 8866 and for killing a cow when the sinner is a brāhmana or a member of another caste. 288 The Mit. (on Yaj. III. 23) quotes a prose passage from Kāsyapa on freedom from impurity on death of infants.257 The quotations in the Smộticandrikā on ähnika and traddha are all in verse. Haradatta on Gautama (22. 18 ) quotes a sūtra on the prāyaścitta for govadhu, 258 which is also quoted by Visvarūpa. Haradatta (on Gaut. 23. 26 ) quotes a very long sūtra on the prāyascittu for eating several things and doing</li>

Aparārka quotes several sūtras and a few verses under both names Kaýyapa and Kaśyapa (vide Yāj. I. 64, III. 265, III. 21, 25, 251, 288, 290, 292 ).</p>
<p>In the Deccan College collection there are two mss. (No. 200 of 1884-87 and No. 122 of A. 1881-82) which contain a Kāśyapaşmộti in prose (4. folios having 8 lines on each side ). It begins&rsquo;athātaḥ Kāģyapiyān grhasthadharmán vyākhyāsya maḥ&rsquo;. It deals with the duties of householders, with prāya Ścittas for doing mischief to wells, dikes, ponds, temples and houses of Brahmanas, for killing a cow and other beasts and birds, with rules on mourning after death and impurity on birth, with prāyaścittas for eating garlic and other similar things, with the five mortal sins, with priyaścittas when such portents as earthquakes, lightning flashes occur, or for such accidental occurrences as the breaking of the milk pot, with purification of vessels of wood and inetals, with the visible physical sins and sing committed in previous lives, with the seven punarbhūs.</p>
<p>In this work some of the sūtras quoted as Kāşyapa&rsquo;s in the cominenturies are found (e. q. the quotation No. 259 &ldquo;lasuna&rsquo; &amp;c. above ). So also the verses about punarbhús of seven kinds quoted by Haradatta are found in the mss. In this sinti, Kiiśyapa is frequently cited as an authority.</p>

XIII. pp. 267-282 with an appendix containing passages and verses attributed to Kāśyapa (pp. 283-292 ) by Viśvarūpa, Vijñāneśvara, Aparārka and others not found in those mss. Aparārka mentions Kāśyapa 13 times ( almost all verses except on p. 922 which is in prose) and Kaśyapa six times.</p>
<p>It is to be noted that Käśyapa is not mentioned by Yáj. as one of the dharmaśāstraprayojakas, though Parāśara (chap. I. 13) mentions Kāśyapă dharmāḥ. The Smộticandrikă (I. p. 1) and the Sarasvativilāsa (p. 13 ) speak of 18 Upasmrtis in which Kāśyapa&rsquo;s is included.</p>

<li>Gārgya Višvarūpa (on Yaj. I. 4-5) quotes a verse of Věddha Yájñavalkya in which Gärgya is enumerated among the expo unders of Dharma ( dharmavaktūraḥ). He quotes two sūtras, one from Gárgya ( on Yāj. I. 72260 ) and the other from Vțddha Gārgya361 (on Yâj. I. 195). Therefore it seems that a sutra work of Gárgya on dharma did exist. The Mit. (e. g. on Yāj. III. 326 ), Aparārka and the Sinșticandrika quote several verses of Gārgya on õhnika, śräddha and práyascitta. Parā sara (I. 13) mentious Gárgya among writers on dharma. Apa rārka contains (pp. 124, 190, 368, 544 ) verses from Gárgya on topics of dharina. It seeins that the two writers are identical. Aparārka also quotes several verses from Gārgya of astrono mical import (e. g. p. 5:17 on the nomenclature of the months as Caitiu in connection with the signs of the zodiac). This was probably an independent work. Fragments of a Gärgi samhiti on astronomy and astrology have been recovered and it contains valuable historical information ( vide Kern&rsquo;s pre face. to Brhat-samhită pp. 33-40 and Mr. Jayasval in JBORS. vol. 14, p. 397 (F).

Mantras and on pp. 1103, 1190, 1199 provides expiation (in prose) for causing the death of a cow, for one who touches or carries to tbe cemetery or cremates a suicide, and for close contact of Cāudālas with houses, earthenots and states that for children, the ayed and women the expiation is only half of what is prescribed for grown-up inen. Apurárka quotes only one verse on Yáj. III. 264-265 as mild expiation in cer tain cases of causing the death of a cow. The Mit. on Yāj. III. 30 cites a long prose passage as regards the times when a bath with clothes on is necessary.</p>

<p>Visvarūpa (on Yāj. I. 4-5) quotes a verse of Vrudha Yājñavalkya in which Jātukarya is mentioned as an expounder of dharma.389 The name is variouly written as Játūkarni or Jātākarnya or as Jatukarna. The Smyticandrikā quotes a passage from Angiras in which Játükarnya is enumerated among writers of Upasmrtis. Visvarúpa quotes prose passages from Jātūkarnya a number of times.363 On Yāj. I. 1, he gives a gūtra about “pratilomas&rdquo;; on Yāj. I. 2 there is &amp; sūtra saying that a pupil should not all of a sudden put a question to his teacher in an assembly of people, on Yüj. I. 29 about a Ksatriya and Vaisya wearing an Upavita of hemp and wool when initiated for sacrifice, on Yāj. I. 37 as to the age when a Brähmana became a vrütya, about the prohibition of marrying another wife of a diferent caste when one has already married a savarna wife (on Yaj. I. 79 ), about the time for sraddhas (on Yaj. I. 215 ). These quota tions show that Jätukarạya composed id sutra work on ācāra and srāddha, which was comparatively uncient.

<p>and later writers are in verse and so it appears that by that time the work had been lost or forgotten. Aparārka (p. 423 ) quotes a verse of Jātükarnya which refers to the zodiacal sign Virgo. This would place the verse Jätükarnya not very much earlier than the 3rd or 4th century A. D.</p>
<p>Maskarin on Gaut. Dh, S. quotes, on different sūtras, a number of verses e. g. on 10. 61 (three verses ), 14. 31, 15. 1, 21. 3, 22. 20-21 (two verses ), 22. 36 &amp;c. The Smrti-can drikā quotes verses of Jātukarıya five times on Ahnika and twelve times on Sraddha and a prose passage ( Alnika p. 114, Gharpure&rsquo;s ed.) on what is meant by Uttariya (in Srauta or Smärta rites ). Aparārka (p. 1069 on Yāj. III. 253 ) quotes a verse of J. that if a boy whose upanuyanu had not been perfo rmed drinks by mistake liquor the prayascitta is three krc chras to be undergone by the boy&rsquo;s mother, brother or father. Visvarūpa quotes several prose passages of Jātākarụya ( vol. 1. pp. 7, 46, 48, 144 on Sraddha), while Mit. quotes several verses on Yāj. I. 256, III. 17, 30, 253, 259-60. The name Jātükarnya is an ancient one. The Kītyāyana Srautasūtra (IV. 1. 23 ft) 204 mentions the view of Jātukarnya on pinda pitryajñol when all the three paternal ancestors of the performer are not deal and the Kalpataru on Srāddha (p. 240) remarks &lsquo;Jivatpit;kasya trayah pakšāņ&rsquo;.</p>

<li>Devala The name Devala as that of a sage frequently occurs in the Mahābhārata and is closely connected with Asita. Vide Sabhäparva 59. 9-11, Salya 50 and Säntiparva 230. In Subhā ( 72. 5) it is stated that Devala declared that a man has three lights viz. son, actions and correct knowledge. In the Gita also (in X. 13 ) Arjuna says all the sages, the Devasși Närada, Asita, Devala and Vyāsu speak of you as done in X. 12&rsquo;. Sarkaricñrya in his bhâsya on Vedānti sutra 1. 4. 28 states that the Sărkhya system is nearer to Vedanta than other systems like the atomic theory, since it espouses the doctrine of the non-difference between cause</li>

<p>and effect and adds that some writers of Dharmasutras such as Devala do rely on it in their works. So Devala dharmasūtra was not only earlier than Sankarácārya, but was also regarded as early as (if not earlier than ) the sutras based purely on logic or the atomic theory. In vol. V (of His. of Dh.) pp. 380-81, 1439 n. 2363, 1445, 1453 note 2390, 1458 note 2398 some passages have already been cited from Devala (as quoted in works on Dharmaśāstra ). They will not be repeated here. But a few more passages quoted from Devala by the Mit., Aparārka, Kalpataru and others will be set out or referred to. In the first edition also some references were given where passages of Devala are referred to but hardly any quotations in Sanskrit from Devala dharmasūtra were set out. It may be stated here that early extant commentators like Visvarūpa and Medhătithi do not quote prose passages from the Devala Dharmasūtra relating to Sänkhya and Yoga. But Aparārka quotes profusely from Devala ( about 130 verses and prose passages 15 times ). Some of the prose passages may be pointed out. On p. 72 a long proge passage is cited about the rules to be observed by one who has decided to be a perpetual student.</p>
<p>In the Mit. there are several prose passages quoted from Devala, e. g. on Yāj. I. 120 there is a sūtra on the dharmas of the sūdra and the avocations open to him ; 265 on Yāj. I. 128 there is a sutra dividing householders into Yīyāvara and Salina and describing each of them.266 In Aparårka and the Smộticandrikā there are several prose quotations from Devala. On Yāj. III. 58 Aparārka quotes a lony prose passage on the rules of conduct for a yati; on YĂj. 207 III. 109 Aparărka cites</p>

<p>a very long passage, in which Sārkhya and Yoga are defined; reference is made to extensive Tantrus on the two systems and a brief résumé is given of the Sārkhya system, which greatly resembles the Sankhya-kārikā and the Tattvasa māsa. On Yāj. III. 227 A parārka has a prose quotation from Devala about patitas. In the Smộticandriki (I. p 63 ) there is a lengthy passage from Devala on the daily duties of the brahmucárin, a sūtra (I. p. 52) is quoted about brahma carya for 48 years and in another place there is a prose passage about the wife&rsquo;s duties.408</p>
<p>Sankarācārya 309 ( in his bhāsya on Vedāntasūtra 1. 4. 28 ) states that Devala, author of a Dharmasūtra, accepted the Sankhya tenet of Prudhāna being the cause of the world.! Devala is very profusely quoted in the several kändas of the Kalpataru of Laksmidhara e. g. he is quoted 40 times in Srāddha, 21 times in Vyavahāra of which only two are in prose, 22 times on Brahmacari, 32 times on Moksa, 27 times in Niyata kāla, 35 times in Grhastha. In the Tirthakāụda ( pp. 249 ff) rivers from Sarasvati to Godavari, Käveri, Támraparņi are mentioned. On p. 72 of Sriiddhakanda there are two verses in which Manu is named as an authority on Sråddhakalpa. On Danakanda (pp. 5-9 ) there is one sutra and 36 verses in explanation of that sūtra and the verses are quoted on eight kinds of brahmanas (on pp. 30-32 ). In Vyavahāra ou p. 393 there are two verses of Devala, in the 2nd of which the opinion of Manu on usvāmya (non-owner ship) of women and slaves is mentioned viz. &lsquo;patyau jivati</p>

<p>The Sm. C.quotes Devala 86 times on Ahnika, 71 times on Srāddha, 26 times on Vyavahāra. On p. 22 of Kalpataru on Srāddha occurs the verse · Mánava! Sráidhakalpoyam Manunā samudāhạtaḥ&rsquo;. On pp. 272-273 of the Brahmacári-kānda there is a long prose passage on &lsquo;brahmacáridharma&rsquo;, while on pp. 208-210 of Srāddha-kānda twenty-two verses are quoted from Devala on pindavidhāna&rsquo;. On pp. 811-12 of Vyavahāra-kānda there is a prose passage on four anulomas and 6 prutilomas and four verses explaining them and stating that the son of a brābmana from a ksatriya wife and the son of a ksatriya from a vaisya wife are assimilataid to the father ; on p. 7 of Moksakānda there is a blending of the Sārkhya with advaita doctrines; on p. 100-101 of the same kanda the Sankhya doctrine of Mūlapraksti&rsquo;, seven prakřtivikştis, 16 vikāras is set out at length,</p>
<p>In the Mit., in Haradatta, Aparărka and the Smộtican drikā there are numerous quotations in verse from Devala on ācāra, vyavahāra, śräddha, prāyaścitta and other topics. That seems to have been an independent work. In the Anan dāśrama collection of smộtis there is a Devalasmộti in 90 verses dealing with purification and prayaścittas for contact with Mlecchas. This appears to be a late compilation. Some of the verses contained therein are ascribed to other authors, e. g. verses 17-22 are ascribed to Apastamba by Aparărk&amp; (on Yāj. III. p. 1200) and verses 30-31 are ascribed by the Mit. (on Yāj. III. 290 ) and Aparárka to Visuu.</p>
<p>It is to be noted that verses 82-90 at the end of this Devalasmộti are the same as Yāj. III. 315-324 (with slight variations ). Devala himself is named in verses 25 and 72 and Vyāsa in verse 68.</p>
<p>The Dharmasūtra of Devala, to judge from the quotations in the Křtyakalpataru, Aparārka, Smộticandrikā and other early digests, appears to have been an extensive one and to have dealt with most of the topics that are discussed in the Dharmasutras of Gautama, Ajiastamba, Baudhiyana, Harita and others and also some matters in detail such 48 Sårby and Yoga. The above works contain large prose extracts from</p>
<dl>

<p>:$$. Devala</p>
<p>it on topics of Dharmaśāstra. A few examples may be cited here. In the Brahmacári-kānda of the Kalpataru on pp. 30 and 100 there are prose passages on the Vedāngas and itihāsa and on pp. 272-73 a long prose passage on the duties and other observances of a brahmacārin; in the Sraddlia-kända there is a very long prose passage ( covering one page ) on the persons to be avoided in Srāddha ( pp. 78–79), but most of the other quotations are in verse; in the Gphastha-kānda (p. 119) occurs a long prose passage on the seven pākayajias, seven haviry jails and seven somu-yujnus; on pp. 254-255 a long prose passage on Ksătradharma and on pp. 304, 309, 312 prose passage on hindā, anrta ( falsehood ) and steya (theft ) respectively. In the Niyatakāla section (p. 142 ), the setting up of sacred smärta fire after marriage is provided in &amp; prose passage; in the Vyavahārakānda (pp. 811-812 ) there is a prose passage naming four kinds of anuloma castes, six pratiloma castes and 6 anturālis castes and on p. 834 of the same kända are set out in prose the duties binding on all men including câudalas. It is clear that the Devala Dharmasutra was not all in prose; it contained numerous verses also; for example, on pp. 387-393 of the Grhastha-kānda in a prose passage referring to sinful taints of three kinds (viz, mental, vocal and bodily ) several verses are quoted describing separately the dosas of these three kinds. Therefore, the Devala Dharmasútra contained verses also. But the present author is not prepared to hold that the several hundred verses ascribed to or quoted from Devala in several works (e.g. Apa rärka quotes about 120 verses from Devala ) and in other digests are part of the Devala Dharmasūtra ; many of them are very probably taken from a Devalasmộti in verse. Hardly any other Dharmasútra deals with Yoga and its technical terms ike prānāyāma, pratyahára, dharaná at such length as Devala does (vide H. of Dh. Vol. V. pp. 1380-81, notes 2263-64 ) for Sankhya technique, p. 1409 n. 2314 on definition of Yoga, p. 1435 note 2356 ( on prāna and apāna ), p. 1439 note 2363 on prāķāyārna, p 1445 n. 2375 on pratyāhāra ), p. 1447 n. 2380 (on Dharană ), 1453 (n. 2390 on Siddhis), p. 1458 n. 2398 (on aharkäru and mamatva ). It may be noted that prose quotes, tions from Devala are only a few (namely those un Yāj. HA 26, III. 58 and 256 ), while about two dozen verses of Devat arg. quoted on several other verses of Yij.</p>

<li>Paithinasi Though not enumerated in Yājsavalkya, Paithinasi seems to have been a comparatively ancient sūtrakāra on Dharma. On Yāj. III. 262 Viśvarūpa quotes a sutra of Paithinasi on the prāyaścitta for kiling a cow. Dr. Jolly (R. und $. p. 12 ) following Dr. Caland (&ldquo;Ahnencult &amp;c.' pp. 99, 109) thinks that Paithinasi belenys to the Atharvaveda as the prose quotations on frăddha agree with the ritual of the Atharvans. The Mit. (on Yāj. I. 53 ) quotes a sutra of Paithinasi to the effect that di person should marry a girl who is beyond the third degree on the mother&rsquo;s side and beyond the fifth on the father&rsquo;s side. 271 On Yāj. III. 17 the Mit. quotes two sūtras relating to impurity on death.272 The Smộticandrikā, A parárka, Hara datta and other writers quote numerous sūtras of Paithinasi. The Smyticandrika has a prose quotation on the duties of women.273 In another place the Smộticandriká (II. p. 263 ) cites a sūtra on partition.274 Aparūrka (p. 112 ) quotes two verses of Paithinasi recommending the practice of sati to women of all castes except Brühmana women.

Then the sutra quotes a verse on the same topic, which seems to refer to Manu 9. 194 in the word of sixfold origin' (gadāgama ). Another sūtra quoted by Aparārka (p. 754 ) says &lsquo;when an appointed daughter dies, her husband does not take her wealth; if she be issueless, her mother or mother-in-law should receive it&rsquo;. Aparārka quotes a verse of Paithinasi (p. 921 ) at the time of marriage, famines, sacrifices, fairs and pilgrimages there is no impurity due to birth or death'.</p>
<p>Fragments of Paithinusi Dharmasūtra were edited by Prof. T. R. Chintamani ( 1939 ) and published in Annals of Oriental Research ( University of Madrus ). The Mit. on Yāj.

<p>observed by a son being far away are ten from the day be hears of the death of his parents. P. in Vyavahāra-kalpataru p. 627 provides &lsquo;womenima are the presiding deities of the house, no rules of saucil (purification) or vrata or fasting are obliga tory for them; they reach the highest worlds by merely look ing after their husbands&rsquo;. This is not to be understood literally but what it conveys is the great worth of pati susrisa.'; compare Manu V. 155 and Yaj. I. 87. Kalpa° on Vyava° p. 742 quotes a verse as occurring in both Sankha likhita and Paithinasi. Visvarupa ( on Yaj. III. 262 p. 147) provides (in prose) a prāyaścitta for à goghna ( one who causes a cow&rsquo;s death ). Paithioasi appears to have held the same view that is ascribed to Aupajanghani in Baud. Dh. S. II. 2. 39-41 (these verses being also quoted by Ap. Dh. II, 6. 13. 6 and also in Vas. 17. 9 without name in both ). Vide H. of Dh. Vol. II. p. 602 on 1417. Kalpataru on Vyava hāra p. 603 has : पैठीनसिः । तस्माद्रक्षेद्रायां सर्वतः । मा स्म सङ्करो भवत्विति । आह अप्रमत्ता रक्षत तन्तुमेनं मा वः क्षेत्रे परबीजान्यवाप्सुः । भायौं रक्षत कौमारी बिभ्यतः पररेतसः ।. One expects वाप्सुः instead of अवाप्सुः (as मा precedes). The editor quotes only विवादरत्नाकर on p. 603 probably to clinch his thesis that Candesvara merely borrows matters from Lakşmidhura and does not refer to Baud., Ap. or Vas., whom I had quoted years before in Vol. II (of H. of Dh. ).</p>

<p>earliest writers and works to mention him. In the Deccani College Collection there are two mss. of a Budha-dharma Sastra in prose ( No. 507 of 1881-82 and No. 145 of 1895-1902, 2 folios ). The work is very brief 279 and speaks of upa mayana. marriage, eight forms of marriage, the samskāras from garbhadhāna to ujana yana, the five daily great yajñas, Sraddha, pikayajinas, haviryajnas, somayaga, the means of subsistence for a Brāhmana, the duties of Vaiśyas and Sūdras, the orders of forest hermits and sunnyāxins, removal of thorns by the king, administration of justice, king&rsquo;s duties.</p>
<p>The work does not produce the impression of being early. It is in the nature of a summary of larger works on dharma. All quotatious in Hemūdri cited from Budha are not found in the mss.</p>

<p>That Bphaspati was an ancient teacher of Arthaśāstra follows from the Kauţiliya, wherein the Bārhasratyas are cited six times. In the Mahabharata (Sinti. chap. 59. 80-85) Brhaspati is said to have compressed into 3000 chapters the work on dharma, artha and kāma composed by Brahma. The Vanaparva ( 32. 61) speaks of Brhaspati-niti. The Maha bhārata several times cites verses (yrithas or slokas ) said to have been sung by Brhaspatia80 ( vide Sinti. 23. 15, 56. 38-39,</p>

<li>6-7). Vide also santi. 58. 13-16, 69. 23-24. The Anu sāsana ( 39. 10-11) speaks of the Arthaśāstra composed by Brbaspati and others. In some of these places there are dist inct references to a śāstra or mata of Bșhaspati and sections of his work are referred to (as e. g. rājādhikāra ). The Sānti parva (170. 12) describes how a king could, according to Bphaspati&rsquo;s views, secure his goal in four ways.281 In the Vanaparva ( 150. 29 ) men are said to be upheld by the nayas proclaimed by Bșhaspati and Usanas. Vide also Sabhā 50. 9, 55. 6, 73. 7-8, Udyogu 33. 71-72, 55. 66. The Kamasutra repeats the tradition that Brahmã composed a work in one bundred thousand chapters on dharma, artha and kama and that Bphaspati dealt with a portion of that work, viz. on artha.383 Vide note 238 above. Ašvaghofa (Buddhacarita I. 46 ) speaks of the rājaśāstra of Sukra and BỊhaspati. Accor ding to the Arthaśāstra of Kautilya some of the special views of Bșhaspati&rsquo;s school were that there were only two vidyās for kings viz. vārtă and dandaniti and that the council of ministers should comprise 16 members. According to Kåman. daka and the Pancatantra ( II. 41 ).aviśvāsa ' was the sheet anchor of royal policy according to Bșhaspati. The Yasasti laka ( p. 13 ) says that the niti of Bphaspati had no place for Gods.283 The commentary on the Nitivākyämrta gives the first verse of BỊhaspati.384 Visvarūpa contains several prose quotations (which from their context must have been taken from Brhaspati ) about the qualifications of a senápati, prati hāra, duta &amp;c. It is somewhat strange that in this quotation the mantrin is required to be deeply conversaut with the bästras of Manu, Bșhaspati and Ufanas. For similar prose quotations, vide Visvarūpa on Yāj. I. 323, II. 154. That Bșhaspati also wrote a sūtra work on Vyavahāra and other topics of dharma follows from the quotations contained in</li>

<p>Visvarupa and Haradatta. For example, Visvarupa cites a prose passage from Brhaspati (on Yaj. II. 38 ) about the duty. of the king to restore property stolen from his subjects if he could not recover it from the thief, about the rising scale of the rates of interest according to the castes; about the debts of a deceased man being payable by those who took his wealth, by his wife or by his son ; about a surety being made to pay when the principal died; about the illegitimate son of a sūdra getting a share on his father&rsquo;s death and about his taking the whole estate with the king&rsquo;s permission if there were no legitimate issue of the sūdra.285 Haradatta on Gau tama. 22. 18 quotes a prose passage from Brhaspati on the prāyaścitta for killing a cow. These quotations establish that Bphaspati wrote a sūtra work on dharma also (i. e, at least on vyavahira and prayascitta). Visvarupa also quotes a few verses from Brhaspati on vyavahāra and prāyaścitta and in one place at least indicates that the verse he attributes to Bșhaspati occurred in the same work in which a prose passage quoted by him occurred. 288 From this it follows that the sūtra work of Rphagpati on dharma contained verses also in Visvarāpa&rsquo;s time. Whether the two works on arthasāstra and dharma were composed by the same Brhaspati cannot be determined. It looks probable that they were composed by different authors. Yaj. (I. 4-5) mentions Brhaspati among the expounders of dharma. He is probably referring to the sūtra work an dharma disclosed by quotations from Visvarupa. 285 तथा च बृहस्पतिः &lsquo;चोरापहृतं तु सर्वेभ्योन्विष्यार्पणीयम् । अलाभे स्वकोशाद्वा।</p>

<p>History of Dharmasastra</p>
<p>In the Mit. and other commentaries and nibandhas over seven hundred verses on vyavahāra and a few hundred more on ācāra und prayascitta are cited from Bộlaspati. That seems to have been an independent work composed between 300 and 500 A. D., which will be discussed later on (vide sec. 37).</p>
<p>In Jivananda&rsquo;s collection (part I. pp. 644-651 ) and in the Anandāśrama collection there is a Bșhaspatismộti in 80 verses in which Brhagpati is represented as instructing Indra about gifts. Several mss. in the Deccan College Collection contain this smrti, but in an abridged form in 70 and 49 verses (No. 130 of 1884-86 and No. 147 of 1895-1902). Vide also I. O. cat. p. 386 No. 1324, 1325-1328. Apararka quotes (p. 1225 ) verse 7 of this smrti (in verse ) and the Dänaratna kara quotes verses 6 and 7 as from Dana-Brhaspati.</p>
<p>The Barhaspatya Arthaśāstra edited by Dr. F. W. Thomas (Lahore, 1921 ) is a later work and does not deserve more than a passing notice. In six chapters it deals with the con duct, duties, studies of kings, omens, rules of policy &amp;c.</p>
<p>27 Bharadvāja and Bhāradvaja Dr. S. C. Banerjee in his work ( Dharmasītras, a study in their origin and development) published in 1962 at Calcutta quotes only three prose passage of Bharadvája. Although he publishes his work thirty years after the first vol. of the H. of Dh. he does not mention two prose passages which had been cited on pp. 126, 127, of that volume.</p>
<p>There is a Srauta sūtra and a Grhya sūtra attributed to Bhāradvāja. The Ms. of the sranta in Bombay University Library contains nine praśnas and a portion of the 10th and begins&rsquo; darśapaurņamāsau vyakhyāxyāmah.' It quotes Ale khana and Āśmarathya frequently. The Gyhya has been edited by J. W. Salomons. It appears from quotations iu Višvarūpa and other early commentators that a sūtra work on dharma attributed to Bharadvāja or Bharadvāja was in existence. The forms Bharadvája and Bhäradvāja probably refer to the same work. On Yaj. ( 1. 15 ) Visvarūpa quotes a prose passage from Bhāradvāja prohibiting the learning of mlecchu tongues and calling upon the preceptor to teach his pupil pure words</p>

<p>That Bhăradvája was an ancient writer op arthaśāstre follows from the Kautiliya, where in the views of Bbāradvāja are cited seven times and of Kanika Bharadvāja once. Some of the views of Bhåra iväja as described in the Kauţiliya are that a kinj should choose his ministers from amongst bis fellow-students, that the king should consider his line of policy alone in secret, that the princes should be punished secretly when they manifest po love for the king their father, that the minister should set one priuce against another when the kinu is on his dentli-bed, that when calamities befall the king and the minister, the former is the lesser of two evils, that one should bow down before the strong. This last view occurs in the Mahabhirata in the same words.201 The Santi parva (chap. 140 ) contains a dialogue between Bhāradvāja and king Sutrunjaya of Sauvira in which danda is said to be the most pre-emieut among the expedients.

<p>rājaśāstra. The Yaśastilaka299 ( 4th Āśvāsa p. 100, Nirņaya. sāgara ed. ) quotes two verses of Bhāradväja from his treatise on the topic of the six guras. This shows that Bhāradvāja&rsquo;s work on politics was available in the 10th century and contai ned verses ( probably intermixed with prose).</p>
<p>Bharadvāja ( Bārhaspatya ) is the sage of the whole of the sixth Mandala of the Rgveda. The form Bharadvāja occurs (in the singular ) in several verses (e. g. Rg. VI. 16. 5 and 33, VI. 31. 4) and in the plural also (in Rg. VI. 25. 9 and VI. 50. 15). The form Bharadvaja occurs in Rg. VI. 51. 12 and in VII. 2. 63. Pāṇini mentions Bhāradvāja as a predecessor. The Mahābhāsya notes at least in nine cases that the Bhärad vājīyas read the Vārtikas differently (e. y. Vārtika 9 on Pay. I. 1. 56, Vārtika 3 on I. 2. 22, Vártika 4 on IV. 1. 79). Tbat is, the Bhāradvājiyas were a school of grammarians. Bhāradvāja is said to be the eldest son of Brhaspati in Anušāsana parva 30. 24 ff.. In Santiparvasan chap. 140 there are two verses that state: the king should have the rod of punishment ready (or raised up), that he should always exhibit his prowess, he should have no weak points, but should find out the weak points (of others) and should pursue the holes ( weaknesses) of others; that people are afraid of him whose Rod is raised änd that out of the four upāyur Danda is the supreme one. These occur in Bharadvāja&rsquo;s dialogue in Santi 140. Mapu (VII. 102-103 ) has almost the same verses. Kautilya differs</p>

<p>from these views. He states “The ācāryas say &ldquo;a king desiring the orderly maintenance of people&rsquo;s life should always have the Rod of punishment lifted up (for striking when necessary ); for, there is no such means for keeping beings under one&rsquo;s control as Danda'; &lsquo;No&rsquo; says Kautilya ; for, the king that wields the Rod of punishment with severity becomes an object of disgust to beings; a king who is mild in punishing is treated with contempt, while a king that metes out the proper punishment is honoured; for the Rod of punishment used after proper consideration endows the people with Dharma, Artha and Kāma”.</p>
<p>It appears to the present author that Kautilya instead of separately mentioning Bharadvāja reported in the Santiparva and Manu, probably lumps the three (viz. Bharadvāja, Vyäsa who quoted Bharadvāja&rsquo;s views and Manu) and refers to the three as &lsquo;ācāryāḥ&rsquo; here. It is remarkable that Kautilya no where expressly mentions Vyāsa&rsquo;s name or the name Mahā. bhārata either for supporting his own views or for differing from him or it. In I. 3. 1-2 the Kautiliya first mention&rsquo;s Sámaveda, Rgveda, Yajurveda as Trays, then adds Atharva veda and Itihagaveda and thus makes the Vedas to be five. In the Chandogyopanigad (VII. 1.2, VII, 1. 4, VII. 7. 1) Itibāsa-Purāna is said to be the 5th Veda and it seems that the Kauţiliya follows it. So the Itihāsaveda was entitled to great res ect as Veda. It is probable, therefore, that he does not expressly state anywhere that he differs from the Mahäbharata or from Vyāsa. In the Mahābhārata itself &lsquo;Akhyāna&rsquo; is frequently mentioned as the 5th Veda, as in Vanaparva 58. 9, Udyoga 43. 41-42, Karnaparva 87. 42, Salya 6. 14. The Arthasústra 1. 5 14 ( Purauam-itivrttam-ākhya yikā-udābaranam-dharmaśāstram-arthaśāstram cetibāsaḥ) produces a jarring note, including, as it does, even Dharma bästra and Arthasastra under Itihäga. This does not stand to reason and tradition and is probably an interpolation or a marginal note, which later came to be embodied in the original work.</p>
<p>The Parâsara-Madhaviya (vol III, p. 231 ) quotes a verse of Bharudvaja which divides a pledge into four varie eties. A few quotations from Bharadvāja ou matters of vyavahāra are cited in other works. For example, the Hra svati-vilása cites a verse of Bharadvāja that a compromise the exchange and a partition, if fair and squel, could be annulled</p>

<p>f</p>
<p>only for ten days, but could be annulled till the 9th year, if unfair. 393 It appears that the verses of Bharadvaja on vyavahāra are taken from a work other than the ancient work on politics.</p>

<li>Satatapa Sãtātapa is enumerated among the expounders of dharma by Yāj. (I. 4-5) and by Parasura. Višvarūpa, Haradatta and Aparárka quote several proge passages of Sātātapa on prāyascitta. Visvarūpa (on Yāj. III. 236 ) tells us that Sātātapa -spoke of only eight, upapatakas and that without dealing with śrāddha as a principal topic he spoke of some of the subsidiary details of srāddha.294 The latter passage quoted from Sätātápa is a half verse. So Visvarūpa had a prose work of Sātītapa before him, mixed with verses, Haradatta on Gaut. ( Dh. S. 22. 18 ) quotes a prose passage of Sātāta pa about the penance for killing a cow. Visvarūpa on Yaj. III. 236 (part II. p. 93 ) states that Sătata pa mentioned in a prose passage only eight. Upapatakas .Sātātape tu. astum. vevopapātakāpyuktāni, athopa pătakānyagnyutsūdītyädini' eko. Visvarūpa on Yaj. III. 262 (part.2, p. 148) mentions a gutre of Sātätapa on präyuścittu. Maskarī on Gaut. 23. 35 quotes a prose passage from S. on prăyaścıttas unudaka-mutrapu. risayrabane svakakasparśane Sacelasuinam mahá vyåbrti. homuśca rajasvulnyamane cartildevann'. The Layhu-Satūta pa smrti (Anan. collection) contains several verses of Manu (e.g. verses 103, 105, 107 of it are respectively the girme as Mapu Ill, 237, III. 174, III. 233 and verses 45 and 58 refer to Sātätapa. Vfudba-Sätutupa is quoted several times in Kalpana taru e. g. ou pp. 98-99 of Brahma', on pp. 286, 405 of Grbus tha, 6 times on Sraddha. It is interesting to note that a verse of Satata pa quoted by the Mit. on Yáj. 1. 192 provides that a prāyasetta is not prescribed for men who bathe iri exidvink tbe water from a well or a dam dug or constructed by antyajus.

This work of Sātātapa in verse is most probably a different one from the sūtra work. It appears that there are several smitis ascribed to Sãtātapa. In Jivananda&rsquo;s collection there is a smrti of Sātātapa called Karmavipäka in six chapters and about 231 verses. Its contents are: certain diseases are concomitants of certain sins; gifts of land, cows &amp;c.; eulogy of Brāhmanas; penances for killing a brahmana, a cow &amp;c., penances for drinking wine, for incest and forbidden sexual intercourse of various sorts, for thefts; rites for those who meet with violent and accidental death. The last verse declares that the Smrti was promulgated by Sātātapa to his pupil Sarabharga. It is a late production. It prescribes the reading of the Harivassa ( II. 30 ) as a penance for infanticide. Vide below under Madanapāla.</p>
<p>No. 1362 of the I. O. catalogue (and cat. of Madras Govt. msg. vol.

<p>No. 1361 of the I. O. catalogue is a treatise in mixed pross and verse on prāyaścittas for the Mahāpātakas and Upapa takas. Several verses of Manu ( such as III, 8, 11, 171 ) occur therein. It contains 139 verses. In Mitra&rsquo;s Notices ( II. p. 41) there is a ms. called Karmavipāka in 87 chapters and 2376 verses, of which the work in Jivananda&rsquo;s collection seems to be a part or abridgment.</p>
<p>Aparārka in several places quotes the views of Sätātapa immediately followed by quotations from Víddha-Sātātapa or vice versa (e. g. on Yāj. I. 190, on III. 292 p. 1195 and p. 1201 ).</p>

<p>Hemādri mentions a Vrddha-Satâtapa along with several other smrtikāras (vide note 278 above). In the Vyavahāra mātrkā of Jimutaváhana (p. 305 ) Vrddha-Sātātapa is cited on the six kinds of uttura (defendant&rsquo;s reply ).296 This shows that Vțddha-Sātātapa wrote on Vyavahāra also.</p>
<p>The Mit. (on Yāj. III. 290 ) cites a Bộbat-Sâtātapa.</p>
<p>Hemādri (III, 1. 801) speaks of a bhâsyakāra of Vrddha Sātātape.</p>

<p>From Visvarūpa, Haradatta and Aparārka it follows that Sumantu composed a sūtra work on dharma, particularly on ācāra and prāyaścitta. Visvarúpa quotes prose passages from Sumantu on upapătakas, 390 on prāyaścitta for Brāh mana-murder ( on Yāj. III. 237), for drinking wine ( on Yāj. III. 250 ), for theft of gold (on Yaj. III. 252 ), for incest (on Yāj. III. 253-54 ), for killing a cow and about atatayin (on Yāj. III. 261 ). In one quotation from Sumantu cited by Viśvarūpa the views of ācāryas and of Angirasa are men tioned. 187 The prīyaścittas for Brāhmana-murder and for killing a cow contained in Visvarūpa occur in Haradatta (on Gaut. 22. 13 and 18). Most of the qnotations cited by Visva rūpa occur in Aparárka also. The Häralatā (p. 68 ) quotes sūtras of Sumantu on āśauca. One well-known sutra of Suma ntu is &lsquo;no prāyaścitta (or blame ) is incurred by killing an</p>

<p>Paithinasi includes Sumantu among the thirty-six sages, expounders of Dharmaśāstra. Kalpataru (Br. K. p. 22) enumerates the means of settling (doubts on) points of Dharma viz. Veda, Vedānga, Itibāsa-purāna, Tarka, Mimaṁsā and Dharma-istras and also the practices of families, gana, country, caste and varna, and also the usages of heretical sects, of the āśramas and of those learned in the Vedas. On p. 76 of the Br. kända Sumantu provides that all Brālmanas, Ksatriyas and Vaisyas have to undergo the surixkārıls from Garbhādhana to Vivåha and Yajñas. The Vratakānda ( Kal pao) quotes froin Sunautu numerous verses on Kșirapratipad Vrata (pp. 36-38 ) and on Aśünyasayana-vrata (pp. 41-44). It is possible that some of the verses ascribed to Sumantu in these cases are the compositions of some Sumantu other than the author of the prose sutras. e. y. the verse &lsquo;a householder that does not offer sraddha, when the sun is in Virgo, how can he have wealth and sons&rsquo; &amp;c. (q. by Aparărka on Yāj. L. 217 p. 424). Kalpataru (on sraddha) pp. 90-91 quotes a long prose passage from Sumantu on persons that are (pārktcya (not fit to dine in the same row with others invited at Srād dha ). Aparārka quotes numerous prose passages of Suma ntu on prāyascitta. A much discussed dictum of Sumantu</p>

<p>(q. by Mit. on Yīj. II. 21 and by Aparārka on p. 1043 on Yáj. III. 227 ) is there is no blame ( or sin ) in killing an atrıtayin, except in the case of a cow or a brāhmana that is āta tāyin ). For a discussion of this dictum vide H. of Dh. Vol. II. pp. 148 151 and III. pp. 517-18, and the paper &ldquo;Ātatāyivadha&rsquo; by Prof. Rangasvami Aiyangar in C. K. Raja presentation vol. pp. 197-232. The Mit. quotes several prose passages of Suma ntu on Yāj. II. 21, III. 6, 37, 250, 258, 260.</p>
<p>These quotations from Visvarūpa and others establish that a prose work on dharma by Sumantu existed early enough. It appears, however, that the work was not a very ancient one. Neither Yājüavalkya nor Parāśara mentions Sumantu among the propounders of ilharma. On the other hand the name of Sumantu is an ancient one. In the Bhaga vatapurāna (XII. 6. 75 and 7.1) Sumantu is said to have been a pupil of Jaimini and a promulgator of the Atharvaveda. Vide Sintiparva 341. 19 for Sumantu and other pupils of Vyāsa and Sabhā 4. 11. In the daily turpuņķu the name of Sumantu occurs along with Jaimini, Vaišampāyana, Paila.</p>
<p>Numerous verses on dharma are also cited from Sumantu by Aparārka, the Smịticandriká and other works. This may probably be a different work from the sūtra work of Sumantu. In one verse of Sumantu ( Aparărka on Yāj. I. 223 ) occur the words. Saikhasya vacanam yathã&rsquo; and in another (Aparárka on Yaj. I. 217–218 ) the Kanyā sign of the zodiac is refer red to.</p>
<p>It is remarkable that the Mit. and Aparărka contain po verses of Sumantu on vyavalára. The Sarasvati-vilása is rich in quotations from Sumuntu on vyavahára. A compro mise, exchange or partition, if lair, could be annulled up to the tenth day, but if unfair up to the 9th year ( vide note 293 above). &lsquo;If even as much as a mixit went from the buyer to the seller, that would support the sale of the land (sold just as a small dose of poison permeates the whole boily and when no purchase-money is paid or only a portion is paid, then the purchase is called avukrıty6 and is liable to be set aside if the price is not paid in (good time)'.801 Sumantu prescribes a</p>

<li>The Smrtis The word smști is used in two senses. It is applied to all ancient orthodox non-Vedic works such as Panini&rsquo;s gram mar, to the srauta, grhya and dharma sutras, to the Mahabha. rata, to Manu, Yijnavalkya and others. In a narrower sense smrti and dharmasāstra are synonyms, as Manu says.304. The word smrti occurs in Taittiriya Aranyaka (I. 2). Gautama (Dh. S. I. 2) and Vasistha (Dh. S. I. 4) speak of smrti as one of the sources of Dharma. Ap. Dh. S. (II. 6. 15. 25) employs the word smrti and has in view Gautama&rsquo;s Dharma sutra according to Haradatta. In the Purvamimāṁsā-sutra the word smrti occurs ( vide VI. 8. 23 and XII. 4. 42 ).306 lu the Vedrutusutrus the word smrti is employed in a wide seuse, in one place as relerring even to the sankhya system.308</li>

<p>In that work the word is used, according to Sankara, with reference to the Mahābhārata or the Manusmrti ( Vedānta sutra II. 3. 47, III. 1. 14, IV. 2. 14 ).</p>
<p>Manu applies the word Směti also to works that are opposed to and beyond the pale of the Veda (on XII. 95 ).307 But the word is used in this work in a narrower sense viz. Smrti means a work that is not opposed to the Veda or that does not treat the Veda as not authoritative and treats of varna, jäti, āśramas and cognate topics. The word Smști occurs in the Mahâbharata (Santiparva 85. 10). But the more frequent word is Dharmaśāstra, though Manu (II. 10) says . Smiti is Dharmaśāstra.&rsquo; On Pån.

<p>jali had before him a large smrti literature. Vide I. H. Q. vol. II. pp. 67 ff; I. A. vol. 14. pp. 326-27 ( Kielhorn), I. H. Q. vol. XI. pp. 79-90; Dr. F. W. Thomas Presentation Volume pp. 128-133 on &lsquo;Mahabharata verses and very ancient Dharma sūtras and other works&rsquo; (by the present author). The Maha bhārata is spoken of as Dharmasastra, Arthaśāstra and Kama sāstra (in Adi. 2. 383). The word Dharınaśāstresu or Dhar maśāstrāņi (in the plural) occurs frequently in the great epic ( vide Vanaparva 207. 83, 293. 34, 313. 5; Sānti. 24. 13, 297. 40, Anušāsana 90. 34). The extant Manusmrti also (in III 232) mentions “Dharmaśāstrāni.&rdquo; Dharmaśāstra is a much wider term than Dharmasūtra. The Dharmasūtras are only a few while there are dozens of Dharmaśāstras. Vide p. 21 above for points of difference between Dharnasūtras and Dharnarsástras.</p>
<p>It may be stated that Inscriptions from comparatively early times refer to Smộtis, particularly to the Smrti of Manu. The Valabhi grant of Dhruvasena of Valabhi year 207 (i. e. 525 -6 A. D.) published in 1. A. vol. II. p. 205 qualifies the king as *Manvādi-pranīta-vidhi vidhănā-dharmā.' The Palitana platea of Simhadeva in the year 255 of the Valabhi era (i. e. 574 A. D. in E. I. Vol. XI. pr 16-20 of the Samanta-Mahārāja-Simhă ditya speaks of Varihausa (the father of the ruling chief) as &lsquo;one whose intellect was puritieil by plunging into the, waters of the several Sirtis composed by Manu and others. Similarly, in the Paltana plates of Dharasena Il of (Gupta Samviat) 2.32 (i, e. 571 A, D.) in E. I. Vol. XI. pp. 80 at p. 82, we have the striking description of Guhasena ( father of Dharasena as oue in whose case the title &lsquo;raju&rsquo; was significant because he pleased the hearts of his subjects by properly observing the path laid down by all Sinitis (sakala-smrti pranīta-marya-samyak-paripálnna-piraji-hrdaya - ranjanād auvartha-raja -śabilu!). In the Pulibumra pates of the Estern Cảluky: king Jayasimha ! ( 632-663 A. D. ) occur the words</p>

Here the Smrti uuthors Yajňavalkya, Kätyāyana, Bhrgu ( meaning probably ·Manu'), Argiras and Mürkandeya are specially mentionel, besides the six Philosophical systems of Bhatta</p>
<p>(i.e. Kumirila) and others.</p>
<p>Smrtis mirrored the beliefs and practices of people and also influenced writers and ordinary people. For example, Dr. Sterubach in Journal of Bharatiya-VidyĀ, Vol. XI. ( 1961 pp. 221 309), shows how the Pancatantra stories are often based on or relate to separate judicial problems of civil aud criminal law as well as procedure, although it does not solve any of the problems raised. The Raghuvamsa (I. 17 ) states that the subjects of Dilipa did not swerve in the least from the beaten path laid down from the days of Manu. In Raghu yamsa XIV. 67 Kālidāsa says that Munu laid down that the Dharma of a king was to safeguard varnas and äśramus ( vide Manusmrti VII. 35). The drama Micchakaţika (Act IX) shows that a Brāhmana guilty of murder was not to be senten ced to death and the judge refers to the dictum of Manu (pro bably Manusmrti VIII. 380 ) to that effect.</p>
<p>In ancient times the number of smrtis (i. e. works on dharmasastra ) must have been very small. Gautama men tions by name no smrtıkåra except Mauu, though he speks of dharınaśústras (XI. 19). Baudhiyana names seven (besides himself) authors on dharma, viz. Au pujanghani, Katya, Káśyapa, Gautama, Prajapati, Mandgalya and Hirita. Vasi stha uaines only tive authors, Gautama, Prajápati, Manu, Yama and Härita. Āpastumba meutions a large number, viz. ten, some of whom like Eka, Kuņika and Puskurasădi are no more than mere names to us. Manu speaks of only six ( besi. des himself) viz. Atri, the son of Utathya, Bhrgu, Vasistua, Vaikhåvaga (or ruther Vikhamas ) and Suunaka. But in all these works the writers are mentioned only casually aud there is no regular enumeration or list of writers ou dharma in one place. A parārku quotes (p. 7) a sutra of Gautama (not found in the priuted G. Dh. S.) in which sixteen authors of dharmaśástras including himself are enumerated. 308 The 309 अत्र गौतमः। स्मृतिर्धर्मशास्त्राणि तेषां प्रणेतारो मनुविष्णुदशातिरोत्रबृहस्पत्यशान,</p>

<p>same sūtra with slight variations is ascribed to Sankha-Lik hita in the Viramitrodaya ( Paribhasa-prakāsa p. 16). Yaj fiavalkya is probably the earliest writer who enumerated in one place ( I. 4-5) twenty expounders of dharma (including himself and counting Sankba and Likhita as two distinct persons ). It will be noticed that Yāj. omits Baudhāyana. Parāśara also gives a list of 19 expounders of dharma (exclu ding himself), but his list differs slightly from that of Yāj. Parīšara omits Brhaspati, Yama and Vyāsa and adds Kās. yapa, Gārgya and Pracetas. The Tantra-vârtika (p. 125 ) of Kumärila 81 enks of eighteen dharmasamhitās. Visvarūpa quotes a verse of Vrddha-Yājñavalkya, who adds ten names to the list of Yājňavalkya (vide note 262 a bove).310 The Catur viņsatimata is a work which professes to give the views of 24 sages on dharmaśāstra, viz. all those listed by Yāj. (except Kätyāyana and Likhita ) and six more, viz. Gārgya, Narada, Baudhāyana, Vatsa, Viśvamitra, Sarkha ( Sānkhyāyana ? ). Aigiras as quoted in the Smaticandrika (I. p. 1), Hemadri ( Danak handu p. 528 ), the Sarasvativilisa (p. 13) and other works mention Upasınrtis,311 There is a smrti called Sattrim sanmata quoted by the Mit., Aparirka and other works.

<p>his enumeration of them is slightly different from that of Paithinasi.13 The Vrddhagautamasmrti ( Jivananda part II. pp. 498-499 ) gives a list of 57 dharma-śāstras. The Prayo ga-pārijāta as quoted in the Viramitrodaya enumerates 18 principal smrtis, 18 upasmrtis and 21 other smrtikāras.s14 If all the smrtis cited in the later nibundhas such as the Nirnayasindhu, the Mayūkhas of Nilakantha and the Vira mitrodaya be taken into account, the number of smộtis will be found to be about 100.</p>
<p>The sinštis thus relied upon are the products of different and widely separated ages. Some of them are entirely in prose or in mixed prose and verse, while the large majority are in verse. A few of them are very ancient and were com posed centuries before the Christian era. Such are the dhar</p>
<p>masutras of Gautama, Apastamba, Baudhāyana, and the Manusmộti. Some were composed in the first centuries of the Christian era such as the smộtis of Yājñavalkya, Parisara, Nāraila. Most of the smộtis other than the above fall between the period from 400 A. D. to 1000 A. D. The chronology of all these smộtis presents perplexing problems. Some of the metrical smộtis are remodellings of older sūtras as in the case of Sankha. There are sometimes as many as two or three</p>

<p>different smộtis going under the same name, e. g. Sātātapa, Hārīta, Atri. Then the confusion is worse confounded by the fabrications of sectarian zeal, such as the Hārītasmộti which is full of Vaişņa vite teachings. There are several works going under the naines of well-known smộtikāras with the prefixes Vrddha, Bșhat, Laghu. In many cases the works going under these names are different from the smrtis that are without these prefixes and this differentiation took place at a very early date in certain cases; for example, so early a writer as Visvarüpa distinguishes between Yājsavalkya and Vpildha-Yājuavalkya, Gārgya and Vțddha-Gārgya. Similarly, Visvarūpa quotes (on Yāj. I. 69 ) Vrddha-Manu and (on Yāj. I. 19 ) Vrddha-Vasistha, which latter probably was different from the Vasisthadharmasūtra, as the latter does not contain the details given by Visvarūpa.815 In some cases the works designated Vrddha or Bịhat are larger and in all cases later than the works without those prefixes. For exam. Ple, vide Parisara aud Brhat-Parāśara (Jivananda part II. pp. 53-309), Glutaina and Viddha-Gautana (Jivananda Part II. pp. 497-038). Some of the works with the prefix Všddha are versified compilations of prose works e. g. Mit. on Yåj. III. 267 quotes a verse from Vrddha-Visnu which is merely the versified equivalent of Visuu-dharmasútra chap. 50. 6, 12-14. It appears that sometimes the same work is cited with the prefix Vrddha or Bșhat, e. g. the Mit. on Yāj. II. 135 quotes a passage from Brhad-visnu which is the same as the Vişnudharmasūtra 17. 4-7.</p>
<p>As most of the writers quote from memory and had recou rse to mss. and not to standard editions, even well-known verses are ascribed to different authors in different works. The verses &lsquo;bhrātrnám-aprajāh&rsquo; &amp;c. which are quoted as Nārada&rsquo;s (Närada 16. 25-26 ) in the Vyavahāramayukha are attributed to Sarkha in the Madana pārijāta (p. 680). The three verses about bundhus are ascribed to Baudhāyana by Madhava and to VỊddhaśātäta pa by the Madanapārijāta (p. 674 ).</p>
<p>In spite of all these drawbacks, an attempt will be made in the following pages to arrange some of the leading versified smộtis in chronological order beginning from the Manusmộtit.</p>

<p>All these smộtis are not equal in authority. Most of them are obscure and are only rarely cited by ancient commenta tors. Exclusive of the dharmasutras hardly a dozen emptis have found commentators. If we are to judge of the authority of a smrti by the commentaries thereon, then the Manusmrti stands pre-eminent. Next to it is the Yājsavalkyasmrti.</p>
<ol start="31">
<li>The Manusmrti So many editions of this work have been published in India since 1813 ( when the Manusmrti was first published at Calcutta ), that it is not possible to name them. In this work the Nirnayasāgara edition with the commentary of Kulluka has been used throughout. Another edition of Manu well known on this side of India is that of the late V. N. Mandlik, who published several commentaries such as those of Medha tithi, Govindaraja and others. The Manusmrti has been tran slated into English several times. The best known transla tion is that of Dr. Bühler in the S. B. E. series (vol. 25). Dr. Bühler also added an exhuustive and very scholarly intro duction to his translation and dealt with numerous problems connected with the Manusmrti.</li>
</ol>
<p>In the Rgveda the rgis often speak of Manu as &lsquo;father&rsquo; (in Rg. I. 80. 16, I. 114. 2, VIII. 63. 1 ) without expressly saying</p>
<p>of whom.' But in Rg. II. 33. 13 the sage speaks of Manu 88 &lsquo;our father&rsquo; (Yâni Mavur-avrnitā pită nah). The word Manu in several cases (from the nominative to the locative) and in componnd words like Manu-jāta,' &lsquo;Manu-pritāsah&rsquo; and Manur-hita' occur hundreds of times. In Rg. VIII. 30. 3 the prayer is &lsquo;O Gods! May you protect us, help us, speak in our favour, may you not lead us far from the ancestral path of Manu.&rsquo; In Rg. I. 36. 19 the poet says &lsquo;0&rsquo; Agnil Manu established you as a light for the people.' The gods are often referred to as those to whom Manu offered sacrifices (as in æg. V. 35. 15, VIII. 30. 2, X. 36. 10, X. 65. 14). In æg. VIII. 23. 17 it is said . Kāvya Ušanas is said to have established Agni for Manu.' In æg. VIII. 98. 6 Indra is spoken of as the sha tterer of many cities of the asuras ), as the killer of dasyu and as bringing prosperity to Manu and as the lord of Heaven. The two sūktas (Rg. X. 61 and 62 are ascribed in the Anivkra maụi to Nābhānedistha, son of Manu, the refrain in the first four verses being &lsquo;O&rsquo; intelligent (Angirases ) Hecept</p>

<p>me, the son of Manu, as officiating priest). It may be noted that Nābhānedistha is mentioned in Rg. X. 61. 18 and descri bed as desirous (of securing cows ) and as praying loudly ( Nābhānedistho rapati pra venan). In Ry. X. 62.4 be is referred to as &ldquo;ayam Nābhā' and in X. 62 Săvarnya or Săvarni is said to be Manu ( verse 11). In many of the verses of the æg. in which the word Manu occurs, commentators and translators often hold that the word Manu stands for &lsquo;Manusya&rsquo; (and not merely for Manu as an individual ). But it is clear that in some Rgveda verses at least Manu must be taken as an individual sage ; e. g. in Rg. I. 112. 16 a prayer is made to the Advins to come with help as they did in the past ages (purā ) in the case of Sayu, Atri and Manu. Simi. larly, in 1. 80. 16 reference is made to the sacrifice offered and the sacred verses recited by Atharvan, father Manu and sage Dadhyan in past ages (pūrvatha ). The rși of Sūktas 27-81 of Rg. VIII is said in the Anukramani to be Manu Vairagvata and Manu is mentioned in VIII. 27. 4 and 14, in VIII. 80. 2 ( thirty-three gods ure said to have been offered worship by Manu). On the two hymns (Rg. X. 61 and 62) the Ait. Br. ( 22. 9) tells the story of Nābhānedistha, son of Manu, who was excluded from a share in the paternal wealth by his brothers and explains the refrain &lsquo;pratigrbhạita mänavam sumedhasaḥ&rsquo; (in X. 62 ) as relating to that story.</p>
<p>It is impossible in the short space that can be spared to dilate at length on Manu as delineated in Sanskrit literature from the early Vedic times onwards. He is regarded in the early literature sometimes as the father of the human race ( so far at least as India is concerned ), as one of the very ancient sages, as having brought (or established ) Fire, as a semi-divine being who received from God himself the laws and regulations, as a king in the Krta yuga (Asvamedhika parva 4. 2 ), as the author of a work on Arthasüstra ( Drona parva 7.1). The Manusmști (VII. 42 ) itself states that Mana became king by his disciplined behaviour (vinaya).</p>
<p>In the Taittiriya Samhita and the Tándya-mabå-brāh. mana it is said whatever Manu said is medicine &lsquo;.816 Taitti riya-Samhita (II. 1. 5. 6 ) also says that mankind is Manu&rsquo;s</p>

<p>( Manavyo hi prajāḥ). In the Taittiriya Samhitā (IIL. 1. 9. 4-5 ) and the Aitareya Brāhmana ( V, 14 ) we have the story of Manu dividing his wealth among his sons and of the exclu sion of his son Nābhānedistha. The Satapatha-brahmana (S. B. E. vol. 12 p. 216 ) gives us the story of Manu and the deluge. In the Nirukta (chap. III ) there is a discussion about the rights of sons and daughters. One of the views there propounded is that children of both sexes take their father&rsquo;s wealth and a rk and sloka are cited in support of that position.317 The sloka refers to the opinion of Manu Svāyam bhuva. It is noteworthy that that sloka is opposed to a rik, which means that the sloka is not Sruti but.is Smrti. $o before Yāska wrote tbere were smrti texts in verse in which Manu was spoken of as a lawgiver. We have seen how.Ganta ma and Vasistha quote the views of Manu and how. Apasta mba connects Manu with the promulgation of frāddhas ( 11.7. 16.1). The Mahābhārata in numerous places speaks of Mapa, sometimes as Manu simply, sometimes as Svāyambhuva Manu (Santi 21. 12.) and also as Prācetasa Madu (Santi, 57:48:). In the Mahābhārata (Sānti. chap. 336. 38-46) we are told how the Supreme Being composed a hundred thousand Slokas on dharing, how Manu Svāyambhuv.&amp; promulgated thosa dharmas and how Ubanas and Bfhaspati composed sdotros based on the work of Manu Sváyambbuva.318 In another place the account is slightly different and Manu does not figure thereiu. Sānti-parva (chap. 59. 80–85 ) describes how the original work of Brubmã on the three, Dhurma, Artha, and K’āma, in 100000 cbapters was successively reduced to 10000, 5000, 3000 and 1000 chap, respectively by Visalaksa, Indra, Bāhudantaka, Bșhaspati and Kūvya (Usanas). The prose introduction to the Nārada-smrti says that Manu com posed in 100000 slokas, 1080 chap. and 24 prukaraņas a Dha</p>

<p>rmaśāstra and imparted it to Nārada, who abridged it into 12000 verses and taught it to Mārkandeya, who in his turn .compressed it into 8000 slokas and passed it on to Sumati Bhargava, who again reduced it to 4000 slokas. The Närada smrti then gives the first verse319 of that work which is a combination of the extant Manu I. 5-6 and says that vyava băra was the 9th prakarana out of 24 in the original work of Manu. It will be noticed how this version differs from that of the Mahabhāratib wherein Närada is altogether ignored. The extant Manusinști ( I. 32-33 ) narrates how from Brahma sprang Virāj, who produced Manu, from whom were born the Bages including Bhrgu and: Nárada, kow Brahmä taught the Māstra to Manu, who in his turu imparted it to the ten sages (1.58 ), how some greut gages approached Manu and sought instruction in the dhurmus of the varnas and the intermedi ate, castes and how Manu told them that his pupil Borguwo uld impart to them the gistra (1:58-60).: This appearange is kept: up throughout the work. The sages interrupt: Bhf. gus discourse in several pluces (as in V. 1-2 and XII. 1-2:-). Mapu iş said to be omniscient (117)aud Maou:18: mentioned by name dozens of times in the work with the words : Magu rába&rdquo; (1X. 158, X. 78 etc.), or · Manuf-abravıd”.or:&ldquo;Magar prubadanap.&rdquo; (VIII 139, 279, IX: 239, etc. )That the in troductory words in the Nárada-smrti are not spurious or a later addition follows from the remark of Medbåtithi that. according to the Naradasinști, Prajapati composed to work in 100000 slukas which was abridged by Mauu sud others.390 No one should take very seriously these varying accounts even in the Mahabhúrata and in the Naradasmști, us they are intended to glorify some particular text or texts. According to the Bhuvisya-purdua as quoted in Hemādri, the Samskåra mayūkba and other works, there were four versions of the Svayambhuva sästra composed by Bhrgu, Nárada, Brbaspati</p>

<p>and Argiras.821 So early a writer as Visvarūpa cites verses from Manusmrti as those of Svayambhū (vide com. on Yāj. II. 73, 74, 83, 85, where Manu 8. 68, 70-71, 380 and 105-6 are respectively quoted as Svayambhu&rsquo;s ), while quotations from Bhrgu cited by Visvarūpa (on Yāj. I. 187 and 252 ) are not found in the Mapusmrti. In the same way most of the verses quoted from Bhỉgu by Aparărka are not found in the Madu smrti. One verse which Aparārka quotes from Bhrgu (on Yāj. II. 96 ) speaks of the view contained therein as that of Manu.322</p>
<p>It is almost impossible to say who composed the Mapu smrti. It goes without saying that the mythical Manu, proge mitor of mankind even in the Rgveda, could not have composed it. What motives could have induced the upknown author to palm it off in the name of the mythical Mapy and to suppress his identity it is difficult to say. One motive may have been to invest the work with a halo of antiquity and authoritative ness. Bübler following Max Müller says (SBE vol. 25 p. XVIII) that the Manusmrti is based on or is a recast of an ancient dharmasūtra, viz. that of the Mänavacarana. The ques tion whether the Mānavadharmasútra existed has been disco Boed above ( sec. 13, pp. 141-149 ). Buhler bimself candidly admits (SBE vol. 25, p. XXIII) that the recovery of the writings of the Mānavas has not only not furnished any facto in support of the alleged relation between the Mānavadharma sutra and the Manusmrti, but on the contrary has raised difficulties, as the doctrines of the Mänavagļhyasútra (edited by Dr. Knauer) differ very considerably from those of the Maqusmrti. To take only a few examples : Mānava Gr. S. II. 12. 1-2 are opposed to Manu 3.1; Mūnava Gr. $. I. 4. 7 to Manu 4.95; Mänava Gr. S. I. 20.1 to Manu 2.34 ; Mänava Gr. 8. I. 21. 1 to Manu 2.35; Mānava Gr. $. I. 22. 1 to Manu 2. 36 ; Mänava Gr. S. II. 12. 1-2 to Manu 3. 84-86. Besides, there is nothing in our Manu corresponding to the Vināyakaśānti in the Mänavagļhya (II. 14 ) nor to the tests for selecting . bride prescribed in Mănava Gr. S. I. 7.9, which corresponds to</p>

<p>Asvalāyana Gę. S. I. 5. 5-6. Dr. Caland points out (R. und S. p. 17 ) that, though single verses of the Manusmrti tally with the Srāddhakalpa of the Mänava School, yet the descrip tions of funeral rites widely differ in the two works. There are no doubt some parallels as pointed out by Bradke (in ZDMG, vol. 36, pp. 417-477). There is one circumstance about the authorship of the Manusmrti that deserves to be noted. The Mahābhārata 323 seems to distinguish between Svāyambhuva Manu and Prácetasa Manu. The former is said to be the pro mulgator of dharmaśāstra and the latter of arthaśāstra (or politics ). For example, Santi 21. 12 speaks of Svāyambhuva Manu and Santi 57. 43 and 58. 2 speak of prácetasa as an author on rājušāstra or rājadharma. In some places Manu alone without any epithet is associated with rājadharma or Arthavidyā. It is not unlikely that originally there were two distinct works, one on dharma and the other on arthasāstra, attributed to Manu. When the Kautiliya speaks of tbe Māne Vas, it probably refers to the work on politics attributed to Prācetasa Manu. It is extremely doubtful whether Rāja. sekhara, when he mentions the several views on the number of vidyās (including that of the Mānavas, that they were three), had the Arthasāstra of the Mänavas before him or only copied a passage from Kautilya (vide KĀvyamimāṁsā p. 4). It is not unlikely that the work on dharma attributed to Menu may have contained general directions on the duties of kings. It is therefore (i. e. because there were two different works on dharma and arthagāstra attributed to Manu ) that the views ascribed to the Mänavas hy the Kauţiliya are not found word for word in the extant Manusmrti. One may hazard the conjecture that the author of the Manusmrti, wbo ever he might have been, combined in his work the informa tion contained in the two works on dharma and arthasāstra and supplanted both the earlier works and that this result had not been either accomplished at the time when the Kauti liya was composed or was then quite recent. In the extant Manusmrti, the work is ascribed to Sväymbhuva Manu and then six other Manus, of whom Prācetasa is not one, are enu merated ( I. 62).</p>

<p>The extant Manusmrti is divided into twelve adhyāyas and contains 2694 slokas. Dr. Jolly&rsquo;s edition (published in 1895 ) prepared after collating numerous mss. and printed editions contains only one sloka more. The Manusmộti is written in a simple and flowing style. It generally agrees with Panini&rsquo;s system, though it contains some deviations from it as in the verse &lsquo;säksinah santi metyuktvä&rsquo; ( 8. 57). The foregoing pages have sufficiently shown how it agrees closely with the doctrines contained in the Dharmasútras of Gautama, Baudhāyana, Anastamba. We have also seen how numerous verses are common to the dharmasútras of Vagistha and Visnu and the Manuemrti. The Kautilīya also exhibits remarkable agreement with the Manusmrti in phraseology and doctri Des.824 : What conclusions are to be drawn from this will be discussed later on. Some verses are repeated, e. g. V. 164 165 are the same as IX. 30 and 29. The contents of the Manu: smrti may be briefly summarised as follows: (I) Sages ap proach Manu for instruction in the dharmas of the varnas; Manu describes the creation of the world from the self-existent God more or les in the Sankhya manner; the creation of Virāj, of Manu from Viraj, of ten sages from Manu ; creation of various beings, men, beasts, birds etc.; Brahimă imparts Dharmaśāstra to Manu, who teaches the sages; Manu bids Bhrgu to instruct the sages in dharını ; six other Manus sprang from Svāyambhuva Manu; units of time from nimesa to year, the four yugas and their twilights; one thousand yugas equal a day of Brahmă; extent of manvantara; pra laya; successive decline of dharma in the four yugas; diffe rent dharmas and goals in the four yugas; the special privi leges and duties of the four varnas; eulogy of Brāhmaṇas and of the śāstra of Manu; ācāra is the highest dharma; table of contents of the whole sāstra ; (II) definition of dharmo, sour 324 Compare p oate TouthTerut tearaava tanto alten</p>

<p>The extent of the literature known to Manu was con siderable. He mentions the three Vedas and the Atharva veda is spoken of as the Atharva girasi Sruti ( XI. 33). He refers to Aranyaka (IV. 123 ). The Vedārgas are said to be six (III. 185 ) and they are often referred to without stating the number ( II. 141, IV. 98 ). He speaks of dharma śāstra (II. 10) and also knew many dharmaśāstras (III. 232). By dharmapāthaka (XII. 111 ) he probably means one who has studied dharmaśāstras. He mentions several authors on dharmaśāstra, viz. Atri, the son of Utathya (i. e. Gautama according to commentators ), Bhrgu and Saunaka (all these in III. 16), Vasistha (on the rate of interest in VIII. 140 which agres with Vasisthadharmasūtra II. 50), Vaikhānasa. mata (in VI. 1). He mentions Ākhyānas, Itihāsa, Purānas and Khilas (III. 232 ). He speaks of bruhna as described in the Vedānta (in IV. 83 and 94 ) and is probably thinking of the Upanişads. That he knew some generally accepted works opposed to the teaching of the Vedas is quite clear from his reference to Veda båhyāḥ smştayaḥ&rsquo; (XII. 95). He is probably referring to the writings of the Bauddbas, Jainas and others. He speaks of heretics and their guilds (IV. 30 and 61 ). He refers to atheism and calumny of the Vedas (IV. 163 ) and of various tongues spoken among men (IV. 332 ). He frequently refers to the views of others in the words &ldquo;kecit” in III, 53, 261, IX. 32, &lsquo;eke&rsquo; in X. 10, XI. 45, &lsquo;apare&rsquo; and &lsquo;anye&rsquo;in III. 261. In IX. 49 Manu refers to Gāthās of Vāyu and it appears that at least verses IX. 43-45 are quotations. Yoga had been well developed at the time of the Manu-smrti. In Manu VI. 70 it is laid dowu that even three Pranayāmas when accompanied by Omkáras and the Vyābstis constitute the highest tu pas and that by prānāyāma all the aberrations of the senses (including the mind ) are destroyed. In VI. 72 are briefly indicated the results of Prāṣāyāma, Pratyäbära ( withdrawal of the sepse organsdrom the objects of sense ), Dhāraṇā (the holding of the minetto certain spot or a certain point such as the tip of one&rsquo;s nose</p>

<p>and Dhyāna (contemplation) i. e. one-pointedness of the apprehension of the object contempluted upon. Vide H. of Dh. Vol. V. pp. 1444-49 for explanation of Pratyābāra, Dbā ranā, Dhyāna. The word Dhyānayoga occurs in Manu VI. 73 and 79 and it is stated that by dhyānayoga, one realizes brahman. The words &lsquo;Dhyānayoga,&rsquo; &lsquo;Dhāraḥā&rsquo; and others occur in some of the Upanisads as illustrated in the note325 below. The Yogasūtra is not later than the 2nd or 3rd century A. D. ; vide H. of Dh. vol. V, pp. 1395-98, but the Upanişads had developed much of the yoga technique centuries before the Yogasūtras and the Manusmrti is based on the Upanişads and not on the Yogasūtra.</p>
<p>Numerous interesting and difficult problems are conne cted with the Manusmrti. Bühler in his elaborate introduc tion (S. B. E. vol. 25) exhaustively deals with these problems. It is not possible to go at great length into those questions here. A separate volume would be required to deal with the problems raised by Biihler and to examine the arguments of Bühler, Hopkins and others who have written on them. Only a brief discussion of some of these problems can be attempted.</p>
<p>Bühler takes considerable pains to refute the claims of Manu to be regarded as the first legislator (S. B. E. vol. 25 pp. XXIII-XXX). But no serious refutation of the claim is really needed. The very extent of the literature known to the Manusmrti and the mention of several writers on dharma sāstra by name are sufficient to negative that claim.</p>
<p>Bühler devotes a great deal of space to the consideration of the question as to what circumstances led to the substitu tion of a universally binding Mänava-dharmaśāstra for the manuals of the Vedic schools (8. B. E. vol. 25 pr. XLVI-LVI)</p>

<p>and as to why the special law schools selected just the Mūna vadharmasūtra among the large number of similar works for the basis of their studies (ibid. pp. LVII-LXV ). Bühler then considers the question how the Mánavadharmasútra was con verted into the present Manusirti. Bühler concedes that the last is a problein of great difficulty and admits of an approxi mate solution only. The discussion of all these questions by Bühler is extremely thought-provoking and brilliant in many places, though it must be said with great respect that the arguments are often a priori and gavour more or less of speci al pleading. As I question the very foundation of Bühler&rsquo;s edifice ( viz, the actual existence of a Mänava-dharmasūtra ), it would be futile for me to enter into a discussion of the pro blems referred to above.</p>
<p>Jolly in Introduction to the Vishudharinasūtra (p. XXYII n. 3) admits that Manu has little in common with the Mänava grhya, both in mantras and otherwise, Manu is recognised as an ancient writer on Dharmasastra in the Dharmasūtras. Gaut. Dh. S. 21. 7 refers to Manu&rsquo;s view that three out of the five mortal sins ( Mahápätakus ) could uot be wiped out except by death ( this has a counterpart in the extant Manu smrti in XI. 89, 90, 103-4). The Ap. Dh. S. II. 6. 13. 11 refers to the tradition that Manu divided family property among his sons and also to the tradition (in II. 7. 16. 1 ) that Manu was the founder of the institution of Srāddha rites. Manu is called Srāddhadeva&rsquo; in Bralımānila-purāna III. 59. 38. The Baud. Dh. S. also pientions Manu&rsquo;s division of pro perty among his sons, refers to Maru&rsquo;s opinion that the father is a sinner if he does not arrange a marriage for his daughter within three years after her first monthly illness (IV.1.14) and further that the Aghamarsana hymn (Rg. X. 190. 1-3) is declared by Manu as a penance for all sing ( Baud. Dh. S. IV. 2. 19 20). This reflects Madu XI. 260. The Vas. Dh. S. in numerous places mentions. Mānaram slokam&rsquo; or simply &ldquo;Mānavam', besides verses containing words like Manuh prāha' (in XI. 23 ) or Mannr-āha prajāpatili' (in Vas. XII. 16 ), &lsquo;abravin-manuh (in Manusmrti V.41 and in Vas. IV. 6). This question of the relation of the Manusmrti and Vas. Dh. S. has been dealt with at some length above (pp. 99-103/</p>

<p>An extensive literature327 has accumulated in modern times about Manu and the Manusmrti, about the relation of the Manusinfti to the Dharmasūtras, to the Mahabharata, to the Arthaśāstra of Kautilya and about the development and spread of his doctrines to countries in South-East Asia. The present author has read some of it, but he cannot expatiate on all the topics about Manu in one volume of the History of Dharmuśāstra.</p>

The Arthaśāstru says &lsquo;people of the four vurnals and in the ( different ) dišramas protected by the king with the Rod (of punishment ) and attached to the actions prescribed as their respective) duties keep to the paths appropriate to them.&rsquo; Kautilya (in Artha sästra III. 1. 38 ) calls the king Dharına pravartaka&rsquo; (pro pounder or promulgator of Dharma ).

<p>abide in Rājadharma, that the welfare of the people depends on the king (Santiparva 141. 9 ). Though the general tendency was to say that Dharma progressively declines in each of the four yuzas, yet this idea 32' was not universal. The Mahabharata and the Manusmrti state (in IX. 301) that conditions described about the four yugas are not immutably fixed parts of Time, but it is the ruler (who by conducting himself properly ) can create the conditions of even Krtayuga in what common people call Kaliyuga. There is a great difference between ancient societies (like those in India ) and some modern western societies. In several modern societies there are legislatures that lay down many laws to be observed by the people. In ancient times (in India ), the legislative activity of the ruler was extremely limited. Besides, India was divided into many kingdoms and great conflict of laws might have arisen. Moreover, there was no single ruler who could have legislated for the whole of India, even if the task of legislation was attemp ted. Manu ( in VIII. 3 ) and Katyayana330 provide that causes ( law-suits) were to be looked into (i. e. decided ) by the king according to the Săstras and in the absence of Sāstric dicta, by</p>

<p>the usages of the country and that if the king decides causes by his fiat when there is in existence a Süstric text, it leads him away from heaveu, it brings danger to him from enemies and reduces the span of his life. Manu (VII. 13 ) laid down that since the ruler has in him the glory of eight deities (Indra, Vāyu, the Sun, Yama, Agni, Varuna, the Moon and Kubera ) whatever rules as regards desirable matters he (the king) established, whatever rules he makes about undesirable actions should not be transgressed by the people. Medha tithi and other commentators expressly state that the ruler could not inake a rule opposed to the Săstras and the long standing usages of the people. Therefore, changes in the practices of the people could be provided only by resorting to such devices as the Kalivarjya topics (indicated in H. of Dh. III. pp. 885–968 ) or by composing fresh sastras acceptable to the learned and the leaders of people or by saying that in the four different yugas four different smrtis were predominant as stated in Parāśara-smrti (I. 24). Manu (IV. 176 ) says &lsquo;One381 should abandon what was once) Dharma, if it ends in unha ppiness or it has become hateful to the people&rsquo; and Yāj. (I. 156 ) also remarks &lsquo;what was once ) allowed to be Dharma should not be practised, if people have come to hate it and it does not lead to Heaven.&rsquo; The Vişnu-Purina (III. 11. 7 says the same thing. It is very rare to find one Smrtikāra expressly stating that he dissents from the views of other named smrtikāras. Yaj. (I. 56 ) remarks &lsquo;what is said (by some) that persons of the twice-born classes can marry a sūdra woman is not my view,&rsquo; Manu (in III. 13) allows a brāhmana to marry a sudra woman, but in the following ver ses (III. 14–19) he severely condemns such marriages. That means he condemned the practices of a former age. Similarly, the practice of niyoga ( appointment of a brother-in law to procreate a son on the widow of a sonless person ) was set out at some length by Manu in IX. 53-62, but immediately</p>

<p>afterwards he condemns it (in IX. 64-68)337 as beastly (pašu dharma' in IX. 66 ) and waters down the whole idea by say ing (IX. 69 ) that, when after the betrothal of a girl, the selected bridegroom dies (before actual marriage), then the brother of the deceased should marry that gir). Bșhaspati refers to these passages of Manu by saying that Manu descri. bed the procedure of niyoga but ultimately he himself for bade it ( vide Bșhaspati quoted by Aparārka p. 97 (on Yāj. I.</p>
<p>68-69 ).</p>
<p>Confusion is caused by the fact that ancient texts refer to Svayambhuva Manu, Prācetasa Manu and Manu simply. To take first the Manusmrti itself. The views of Svāyam bhuva Manu are mentioned in Manu VI. 54 ( on the vessels to be used by ascetics ), VIII. 124 (the parts of the body where corporal punishment was to be administered in the case of all offenders except brāhmanas ), IX. 158 (on the twelve varieties of sons such as arrasa, ksctraja &amp;c.). In the first two cases the verb abravit' is used and in the 3rd āha'. No Manu is cited in chapters II and VII. In Manu IX. 138 the etymo. logy of the word &lsquo;putra&rsquo; is attributed to Svayambhuva (Manu not being added ). The words &lsquo;tan-manor anušāsanam occur in VIII. 139, 279 and IX, 239. The words &lsquo;Manur abravīt&rsquo; occur many times, as in III. 150 and 222, IV, 103, V.</p>

He boldly asserts that Vyasa&rsquo;s procreating sons from the wives of Vicitravirya should be condemned like the marriage of Draupadi with five brothers. Ho provides that niyoga was allowed only for kings when the dynasty would have como to an end if there were no 800. He further says that the Vedio Mantra (X. 40. 2) should be explained as referring only to Sūdras, and quotes two verses of Vrddha-Manu viz.

<p>41 and 131, VIII. 168, 242, 339, IX. 182 and X. 63. In Manu smrti IX, 17 Manu is said to have consigned certain special matters to women in general (Manur-akalpayat). Manu Prajāpati is mentioned in X. 78 and in XII. 123 it is stated that the highest Purusa is called by some as Manu Prajāpati. I have not been able to find in the Manusmrti any mention of Prācetasa Manu as having said something, but in I. 35 among the ten Prajāpatis that primeval Manu (son of Virāj) created Pracetas is one. Therefore, it boils down to this that in the 2684 verses of the Manusmrti (in the Nir. edition ) Manu (whether simply as Manu or as Svāyambhuva or as Prajā pati ) is mentioned only about twenty times. In many of these cases the words Mapurāha&rsquo; or Manur-abravit' or Manor-anuśāsanam&rsquo;are' padapūrana'. The earliest ex tant commentator ( Medhatithi ) on Manu IV. 103333 expressly says &lsquo;Manugrahanam slokapūraņārtham, vikalpārtham-anye.&rsquo; This shows that there was at least among those who could read and understand the Manusmrti, no idea about deceiving anybody and that learned people at least did not understand the words as meaning that the primeval Manu had said so. The general tendency in the Manusmrti is to have a complete proposition or idea (and not more or less ) in one verse of 32 syllables. In several cases where that seemed difficult these words were added as &lsquo;padding.&rsquo; In the few cases where great conflict of views is expressed in the extant Manusmrti, the words. Manurabravīt&rsquo;or Manuräha &lsquo;or · Manor-anušāsanam do not occur. For example, as to the propriety of a brābma ụa marrying a woman of the sūdra class the opinions of four sages are mentioned (in Manu III. 16 ). But no words like</p>
<p>• Manu svāyambhuva&rsquo; or Manur-abravit' occur there. The opinion of the extant Manusmrti is that by marrying a südra woman a brāhmana falls into naraka (hell) and by procre ating a son from her he loses his status as a brāhmana ( Manu III. 17 ), while Bhșgu&rsquo;s view seems to be that a brābmana be comes a condemned sinner by having a child (son or daugh ter ) from her. If the entire extant Manusmrti proceeds from Bhrgu, pupil of the primeval Manu, the Bhrgu (in III. 16 ) seems to be a different person altogether. It may be noted that Aparārka on Yāj. II. 96 (p. 696 ) quotes a verse of Brgy</p>

<p>on ordeals in which the view of Manu is stated.334 That means that there was a work of Bhrgu before Aparārka in which Manu was cited. There are only two cases (in the present author&rsquo;s opinion ) where Manu&rsquo;s views are set out and where he may be said to assert his views as against those of others. One is connected with the question of the śrāddha to be offered to three ancestors, when the performer&rsquo;s father and great grand-father are dead, but the grand-father is alive. In this Case Manu gives two alternatives in III. 221-222. The Kalpa taru on Srāddha (p. 240 ) states three views about this ma tter. The other case is about eating the flesh of animals ( dis cussed at length in the Manusmộti in V. 26-56 ). The general tenor of the extant Manusmrti is against flesh-eating, but there was Vedic authority for offering flesh on certain occa sions; therefore, Manu allows the killing of animals only on four occasions (in Madhuparka, in Yajña, in Srāddhas and rites in honour of gods ) and forbids it in other cases ( in V. 41. )</p>
<p>E. W. Hopkins, in his paper on · Professed quotations from Manu found in the Mahābhārata' in J. A. O. S. Vol. XI. pp. 239-275 indulges in some very strongly worded and unca lled-for criticism of the extant Manusmrti and of the views attributed to Manu in the Mahābhārata and in later legal and other works. A volume would be required to refute the one sided remarks of Hopkins. But a few samples must be given. On p. 268 he observes &lsquo;the Sāstram was in great part collated between the time when the bulk of the epic was composed and its final completion, that previous to its collation there had existed a vast number of sententious remarks, proverbial wisdom, rules of morality etc. which were ascribed, not to this treatise of Manu at all, but to the ancient hero Manu as a type of godly wisdom. These I conceive to have floated about in the mouths of the people, not brought together but all loosely quoted as laws or sayings of Manu and these sayings were afterwards welded into one with the laws of a particular text (? sect) called the Mänavas. &hellip; &hellip; I fancy this sect built up their ācāra ( usages ) and Kuladharma ( family law ) out of their own heads, not ascribing them to Manu</p>

<p>History of Dharmaśāstra</p>
<p>Hopkins is obsessed by the occurrence of words like Manura bravit&rsquo; in the Manusmộti and asks “if Manu says all, why emphasize a few ? According to my theory these Manu verses found in the Manu treatise were simply caught up and drawn from the hearsay of the whole Brahmana worlds. Doctrines utterly at variance with the Mānava treatise are palmed off upon us with “Manu said &quot; doctrines&rdquo;. It has been shown above that there are less than two dozen Manu said &lsquo;(to use Hopkin&rsquo;s phrase ) verses in about 2700 verses of the extant Manu and most of them do not at all teach doctri nes at variance with the Mänava treatise. This is a specimen of what some Western Scholars on account of preconceived base less notions write about Indian works and Indian people. On p. 270 he winds up his diatribe in the following words &lsquo;in my opinion the devotees of the legal Sāstra were more knaves than fools.&rsquo; There is no need to criticize these baseless and purely subjective remarks and wild theories about thousands of floating Sanskrit verses among people thousands of years ago, their being welded into one śāstra and new customs star ted on the basis of these verses by a sect like the Mānavas. Apart from the Manusmrti (in which phrases like &lsquo;Manur abravit occur a number of times ) such references do not occur at all in Yāj., there are only a few places in Nārada where such phrases occur and in other early smộtis also there are only a few such references. Some later smộtis do mention Manu in some cases. The reason is obvious. Manu was famed as the great law-giver of ancient times. Some practices and rules had changed in the course of centuries. Later writers wanted changes according to their lights to be recognised, but, if they bad stated them in their own names, little weight would have been attached to them, therefore they probably hit upon the plan of saying in some cases that the view propounded by them had the authority of Manu. Hammurabi professed to have received laws from the Sun. Prophets of several religions profess that what they say is inspired by God Himself. Luther, who rebelled against the authority of the Pope, denou nced Copernicus as a fool and relied upon the Bible for prov ing that it was the Sun that had motion and not the earth. One should like to know whether Hopkins would have been jyrepared to dub as knaves ancient prophets who claimed to have received directly from God what they preached. top kins (in JRAS Vol. XI. pp. 243–246 ) collects some impreca</p>

<p>tory verses occurring in grants of lands stating that he who deprives a donee of land given by former donors or by himself incurs great sin and falls into hell for long periods and so forth. Sometimes such verses are ascribed to Vyäsa (as in E. I.

Vol. XV. p. 249 ) the grant ends with the words &lsquo;atra ca dvau slokāvudāharanti&rsquo; and the two verses &lsquo;svadattām&rsquo; and &lsquo;nu visam&rsquo; are cited without anybody&rsquo;s name and which are Nos. 3 and 11 of the 43 imprecatory verses collected hy the present author on pp. 1271-77 of Vol. II. of H. of Dh.

He also shows that the Mahābhārata (Santi 136. 2 ) exhorts the king not to fill his treasury by taking the property of those who perform sacrifices nor the property dedi cated to Gods.

<p>Manu is not at fault. And such people are certainly not as blamable as men claiming to have direct messages from God in this matter.</p>
<p>There is a rather involved account in the extant Manu smrti about the creation of the world by Paramātman. Sages ask Manu to expound the Dharmas of Varnas and intermediate castes; the evolution is briefly described in the summary of the first chapter above. Towards the end of the first chap ter the Manusmrti winds up by stating the appropriate acti ons for the four varnas, the pre-eminence of the brābmana and by proclaiming that the highest Dharma is ācāra as propoun ded by the Vedas and the Smrtis and that the Smști declares the Dharmas of countries, castes, families, heretical sects and of ganas (guilds and oligarchies ).</p>
<p>The description of Manu as the son of Brahmâ and the primeval promulgator of laws is a mere camouflage or disgu ise. The extant Manusmrti mentions such human authors as Atri, Utathyatanaya, Saunaka, Bhỉgu (all in III. 16 ), Vasi stha ( as laying down the proper rate of interest in VIII. 140); also mentions Smộtis beyond the pale of the Veda ( XII. 95) and above all refers to dusyus who speak mlecchu languages and Arya languages such as Paundrakas, Odras, Kambojas, Yavanas, Pāradas, Pahlavas, Cinas, Sakas, Kirātas, Daradas and Khasas (X. 44-45). Similarly, the śāntiparva ( in chap. 65 )388 mentions in a dialogue between Indra and Māndhātp ( verses 13-14 quoted below) sixteen dasyu-like peoples and in verses 17-21 sets out the Dharmas that should be practised by those people described as living like dasyus. We know from the 13th Rock Edict of Asoka that he tried to propagate dhamma among Yona-kambojas, Nabhāka, Nābhapanti, the Andhras and Pāradas, Bhoja-pitenikas and in the 5th Rock Edict also he mentions Yona-Kambhojas, people of Gandhāra, the Rittikas, Pitenikas and other Western people. These references to people to the West of Aryāvarta would indicate that the extant Manusmrti is not older than about 200 B. C.</p>

<p>I shall now address myself to the discussion of the age of the Manusmrti from external and internal evidence. That ques tion is bound up with other problems, viz. whether there are earlier and later strata in the extant Manusmrti, whether the Manusmộti was recast several times or once only, what relation exists between the Manusmrti and the Mahābhārata.</p>
<p>First the external evidence may be taken up. The bhā kya of Medhătithi is the earliest extant commentary on the Manusmrti and was composed about 900 A. D. as will be shown later on. The text commented upon by Medhā tithi was the same (barring a few various readings ) as the one we now posses 8. Therefore, long before 900 A. D. the Manusmộti was the same as now. Visvarūpa in his commentary on Yāj. quotes over two hundred verses of the Manusmrti either wholly or in part from all the twelve chapters beginn ing with the very first verse. The text that Visvarūpa had before him was the same as the present Manusmrti and the verses were arranged in the game order as at present. Visva rūpa quotes eight verses ( Manu XI. 108-115 ) from Manu (on Yâj. III. 262 ). Sankarācārya in his Vedāntasūtra-bhāgya quotes the Manusmști very frequently. For example, he quo tes Manu I. 5 and 21 (on V. S. I. 3. 28 ), I. 27 (on V. S. IV. 2. 6), II. 87 ( on V. S. III. 4. 38), X. 4 and 126 ( on V. S. I. 3. 36 ), XII. 91 and 105-6 (on V. S. II. 1 and 11 ). In his bhă sya on the Br. U. he quotes Manu dozens of times and calls the Manusmrti. Mánavam'337 (on Bỉ. U. I. 4. 17). He looks upon the Manusmrti as one of the authorities on which the author of the Vedāntasūtra relies.338 The Tantra vārtika of Kumārila stands in a special relation to the. Manusmrti. Vide J BBRA S for 1925 pp. 98-100. He places Manu at the head of all smštis, even higher than the dharmasūtra of Gautama. He cites numerous quotations from the first chap ter of the Manusmrti to the last. He looks upon all parts of the extant Manusmrti as equally authoritative and regards the Manuemộti as the highest authority on matters of dhar</p>

<p>ma. The Mrechakatika (9. 39 )330 refers to the ordinance of Manu that a Brāhmana sinner was not to be sentenced to death, but was to be banished. An inscription of the Valabhi king Dharasena dated in the year 252 of the Valabhi era (i. e. 571 A. D. ) speaks of a king as one who obeyed340 the rules composed by Mauu (I. A. vol. 8 p. 303, Gupta Inscriptions p. 165 ). Vide also I. A. vol. IV. p. 105 where the same words occur in an inscription from Valabhi dated 216 of the Valabhi era (i. e. 535 A. D.). Sabarasvāmin, the bhāsyakāra of Jaimi. ni&rsquo;s sutras, who cannot be placed later than 500 A. D. and may be a few centuries earlier still, says “Manu and others have given instruction &quot; 341 and quotes a verse as a smrti passage which is practically the same as Manu VIII. 416 and similar to Udyoga-parva34a 33. 64. Aparārka and Kullūka point out how the Bhavisyapurāna expounds passages of the Manusmrti (vide Kullūka on Manu XI. 72, 73, 100 and Aparārka pp. 1071, 1076).343 It will be shown below that Brhaspati must have composed his work before 500 A. D. Brhaspati says that the Manusmrti occupies a pre-eminent position because it correc tly represents the sense of the Veda and that a smrti which is in conflict with Manu is not esteemed.344 Brhaspati in nume</p>

<p>rous places pointedly refers to the present text of the Manu smrti. One such quotation about niyoga has been cited above (note 187 ). Bịhaspati says &ldquo;Manu has spoken of quantities (units of weights ) beginning from the mote in the sun-beam to the kāršīpana&rdquo; 345 This is obviously a reference to Manu 8. 132–136. Brhaspati says &ldquo;Mauu enumerated thirteen sons and, just as in the absence of clarified butter, oil is a substitute, so in the absence of an aurasa son or a putrikiī, the eleven kinds of sons are a substitute &ldquo;. 340 This has in view Manu IX 158-160, 180, 127-130, where Manu speaks of the twelve sons, out of whom eleven are substitutes and advocates that a sopless man should appoint a daughter (putrikā, who then is the 13th kind of son ). In another pilace Brhaspati347 decla res “Manu forbade gambling as it destroys truth, purity and wealth ; but others allowed it, provided a share was given to the king (in the gains of gambling ).” This very aptly describes the attitude of Manu (IX. 224) and of Yāj. (II. 201 203). Bphaspati says &quot; If a man kills a cow with a weapon &amp;c., he should perform the penance laid down by Manu, but if he kills a cow by forcible restraint, then he should perform the penance laid down by Angiras or Apastamba.” The reference is to Manu XI. 108-115, Āpastamba Dh. S. I. 9. 26. 1 and Angirasa verse 27 (Jivananda, part I. p. 556 ).</p>
<p>In one place Bșhaspati seems to criticise Manu (IX. 219) when Mhe says: &lsquo;those who declared clothes and other things to be impartible have not considered the position that the wealth of the rich may consist of clothes and ornaments &ldquo;.848 In</p>

<p>another place Brhagpati says “Burgu spoke of sale without ownership after deposit; listen to it attentively, I shall speak of it with more details&rdquo;.340_This keeps in view Manu VIII. 4 and clearly shows that Brhaspati was well aware of Bhrgu&rsquo;s connection with the extant Mapusmrti. Angiras as quoted in the Smộticandrikā (I. p. 7) speaks of the dharmaśāstra of Manu. In the Vajrasāci of Asvaghosa (ed. by Weber ) several verges are quoted as from the Mānavadharma&rsquo; which occur in the extant Manusmrti,850 though it must be admitted that there are others that do not occur. In the Rāmāyana also there are verses cited as from Manu which occur in the extant Manusmrti; vide Kiskindha 18. 30-32 ( Gujarati Press, 1915 1920), where two verses are quoted as &lsquo;sung by Manu&rsquo; which correspond to Manusmrti VIII. 318 and 316 respectively.</p>
<p>The foregoing discussion of the external evidence shows that writers from the 2nd century onwards (if not earlier ) looked upon the extant Manusmrti as the most authoritative smrti. This position it could not have attained unless several centuries intervened between it and these writers. Therefore it must be presumed that the Manusmrti had attained its present form at least before the 2nd century A. D. Even the Mahābhāsya contains a verse which is Manu II.</p>

<p>120.861 But as the verse occurs also in the Anušāsana (104. 64-65 ) no chronological conclusion can be drawn therefrom. The Pratimānātaka (after V. S.) speaks of Manaviyadharma bästra&rsquo; and Pracetasa-srāddhakalpa&rsquo; but as it is in con troversy whether that work can be ascribed to the ancient Bhãsa this reference will serve no useful purpose.</p>
<p>The next question is whether the Manusmrti contains earlier and later strata. There can be no doubt on this point. On numerous points the Manusmrti contains conflicting doctrines. In Manu III. 12-13 a Brāhmana is allowed to have a sūdra woman as wife, while in III. 14-19 it is emphati cally asserted that a sūdra woman cannot be the wife of a brāhmana and heavy disabilities are prescribed for him who breaks the injunction. In III. 23-26 there are contradictory statements about the appropriate forms of marriage for the several castes. In one breath Manu seems to permit niyoga (&lsquo;9. 59-63 ) and immediately afterwards he strongly reproba tes it (9. 64-69). The lengthy discussion on flesh-eating in Manu V. 27&ndash;56 discloses different mentalities. At several places the work seems even to recommend flesh-eating in sacri fices, śrviddhas and madhuparku (V. 31-32, 35, 39, 41 ), while elsewhere it recommends total abstinence from meat on all occasions whatever ( V. 48-50). In one sloka ( Manu II. 145) the father is said to be equal to a hundred ācāryas, while in the next verse the ācārya is said to be superior to the father. In V. 1 Bhrgu is said to have sprung from fire, while in I. 35 he is said to be one of the ten sons of Manu Svāyambhuva. Vide also IX. 32-56.</p>
<p>Bühler devotes considerable space to this question (S. B. E. vol. 25. pp. LXVI-LXXIII). He arrives at the conclusion that the cosmological and philosophical portions in the first and 12th books, the philosophical disquisition in II. 89-100, the classifications of pitarah in III. 193-201, the means of sub sistence for Brăbmana in IV. 1-24, verses 1-4 of the fifth book. the rule about mixed castes (X. 1-7 ) and the duties of castes that are repeated in X. 101-131 were put in when the work was versified from the Mänavadharmasutra.

<p>one may not agree with all the details of Bühler&rsquo;s examina tion and with his theory about the versification of the Mānava. dharmasútra, it may be admitted that most of the passages pointed out by him have rather the flavour of comparative modernity about them. My own position is that the original Manusmrti in verse had certain additions made in order to bring it in a line with the change in the general attitude of people on several points such as those of flesh-eating, niyoga &amp;c. But all these additions must have been made long before the 3rd century A. D. as the quotations from Brhaspati and others show.</p>
<p>In this connection it is pertinent to note that the text of the Manusmrti has been the saine with very few exceptions at least from the 6th century onwards (as the quotations in the Tantravārtika and in the Sărikara bhâsya on the Vedāntasūtra and as the commentaries of Medhātithi and others show ), while the text of the Mahābhārata differs greatly in the diffe rent editions published in our country.</p>
<p>To cite a few examples; Sankarācārya on V. S. I. 2. 19 quotes the latter half of Manu I. 5, on V. S. I. 3. 28 refers to Manu I. 21 in slightly different words, on V. S. IV. 2. 6 quotes Manu I. 28 (anvyo&rsquo; &amp;c.), on V. S. I. 3. 36 refers to Manu X. 4 ( about Südra) and quotes the first half of Manu X. 126; on V. S. II. 1. I quotes the whole of Manu XII. 91 and on V. S. II. 1. 11 he quotes Manu XII. 105-6. From this it is clear that he had before him the extant Manusmrti (from its first to the last chapter ) and treated it as an authoritative Smộti. Similarly, Kumārila ( who, according to the present author, wrote his Tantravārtika between 650-700 A. D. (as shown on pp. 1191, 1198 and notes 1946 and 1952 of H. of Dh. Vol. V.) quotes many verses of Manu ( sometimes as Mänavam ).</p>
<p>The Tantravārtika stands in a special relation to the Manusmrti. Whenever the author speaks of Smộtis, that of Manu is the first to come to his mind and Kumārila refers to him even before the Gautamadharmasūtra. A few examples may be cited. After finishing the discourse on the importance of Veda (consisting of Vidhis, Arthavādas, Mantras and nāmadheyas ), Kumārila starts his discourse on the Stortis and mentions Manu as the representative of or foremost maong Smrtis. On p. 105 he quotes Manu II. 6-7, though he emphy</p>

S. II. 51-52 (on p. 192). The Tantravārtika states that authors of Smộtis are generally prepared to accept as authoritative the usages of countries, castes and families, that are not opposed to the Vedas and first quotes Manu II. 6 and then Gaut.

<p>Another problem is whether the Manusmrti has under gone several recasts. This does not seem likely and the evi. dence adduced in support of the theory that the Mauusmrti suffered several recasts is quite inadequate for the purpose. The occurrence of several conflicting passages can as well be explained on the theory of a single recast and it has also to be borne in mind, as Bübler points out, that Sanskrit writers down to the most recent times are in the habit of placing side by side conflicting opinions without actually preferring a particular view to others. The tradition of the Naradasmrti that the sāstra of Manu was successively abridged by Nārada, Märkandeya and Sumati Bhāryava is, as has been observed above, not worth much, since it is merely intended to glorify Nārada&rsquo;s work. The other traditions given above either ignore Nārada altogether or assign him a secondary position. The present Manusmộti is put into the mouth of Bhỉgu. Nārada&rsquo;s smộti is clearly based upon Manu, though the former diverges from the latter on many points. Bșhaspati generally takes Manu as his text and amplifies the dicta of the Manusmrti (as the verses quoted above in notes 345-348 show ) and so his work may by analogy be regarded as a Vārtika on Manu, as Dr. Jolly puts it. Angiras also looks upon Manusmrti as most authoritative. It is therefore that the Paurānic account ( note 321 above ) regards Bhrgu and other works as the redactions of the original Manusmşti. The quotations cited from VỊddha-Manu and Brhan-Manu do not establish that the original Manusmrti underwent many recasts. Quotations cited under these names are later than the Manusmrti. Višvarūpa (on Yāj. I. 69 ) quotes the views of VỊddha-Manu on niyoga, who allows it only to sūdral. The Mitākşarī quotes a verse from Vrddha-Manu about the widow of a sonless man being entitled to all her husband&rsquo;</p>

<p>History of Dharmaśāstra</p>
<p>wealth while Manu is silent on that point.369 The Mit. on Yaj. II. 135-136 and Madhava (in Parāsuramadhaviya ) quote a verse and a half from Brhan-Manu, which are expansions of Manu (V. 60 ).353 The fact that many quotations ascribed to Manu in several works are not found in the extant Manu smrti is explicable in several ways and not only by the theory of several recasts. For one thing the authors quoting from memory may be found tripping. For example, in an inscrip tion of the Badami Cālukyas of the 7th century two verses that occur in most grants of lands are ascribed to Manu, but are not found in the extant Manusmști.354 No one can for a moment doubt that the extant Manusmrti was an authorita tive work in the 7th century. Therefore, there is hardly any reliable evidence to support the theory that the Mauusmrti suffered several recasts.</p>
<p>Turning now to the internal evidence, the extant Manu smrti seems to be much older than Yājñavalkya, since the rules of judicial procedure are incomplete and awkward in Manu as compared with Yāj., since there is no reference to documents as evidence in Manu, as ordeals are not treated of in Manu, as legal definitions are almost absent in Manu, while frequent in Yāj. and as Manu is silent about the widow&rsquo;s rights, while Yāj. gives her the first place among the heirs of a sonless man. So the Manusmộti will have to be placed some centuries earlier than the third century A. D., the latest date to which the Yājňavalkya smști can be assigned with any show of reason. In X. 44 Manu mentions the Yavanas, Kāmbojas, Sakas, Pahlavas and Cinag365 and in X. 48 Medas</p>

<p>and Andhras. This shows that the extant Manusmrti could not be much earlier than the 3rd century B. C. The Yona, Kamboja and Gāndhāra people are mentioned in the 5th rock edict of Asoka. Manu forbids Brāhmaṇas to dwell in the kingdom of a śüdra ( IV. 61 ) and condemns the appointment of a sūdra as a judge ( VIII. 20-21 ). The late Mr. Jayaswal in his work &lsquo;Manu and Yājñavalkya&rsquo; p. 32 refers to Manu smrti XII. 100350 (among other matters) which states &lsquo;a person who knows the science of the Veda deserves the post of the commander-in-chief, the kingdom itself, the leadership in Government and the overlordship of all the world&rsquo;. He thinks that this is a sample of the aggressive brāhmana spirit that aroge when Pusyamitra Sunga became king. Pușyamitra was a Sevāpati before he became king. Mr. Jayaswal cites other examples of this spirit (such as Manu VIII. 20 which states that even a brāhmana in name only who maintains himself out of the superiority of his caste may be a judge but a sūdra never.&rsquo; This was nothing new. Centuries before the extant Manusmrti, the Tai. S. ( I. 7.3. 1 ) states that Brābmanas are gods that are directly seen. Gaut. VIII. 1 placed the learned brāhmana on the same level as the king. The extant Manu smrti in its arrangement and doctrines is much in advance of the ancient dharmasūtras such as those of Gautama, Baudhā yana and Apastamba. Taking all these things into considera tion Bühler ( S B E vol. 25 p. CXVII ) was certainly right in saying that the extant Manusmrti was composed between the second century B. C and 2nd century A. D. But the question of the date when the original Manusmrti to which additions were made between the 2nd century B. C. and 2nd century A. D. was composed presents very great difficulties. That question is largely bound up with the relation of the Maha bhărata to the Manusmrti.</p>
<p>This question is an extremely intricate one. The late V. N. Mandlik ( Intro. to the Vyavabāramayukha XLVII ) held that the Manusmrti borrowed from the Mahābhārata. Bühler after an elaborate examination of the question (SBE vol. 25, pp. LXXIV-XCVIII) came to the conclusion that it was indisputable that the 12th and 13th parvans of the Mahā, bhārata knew a Mānavadharmaśāstra which was closely.</p>

<p>connected with but not identical with the present Manusmrti. Bühler expresses himself very cautiously and it seems to me that the great scholar was unduly prepossessed in favour of the Mahābhārata as against the Manusmrti. Bühler some what contradicts himself when he says that the author of the epic only knew the dharmasūtras (SBE vol. 25, p. XCVIII). Hopkins ( Great Epic of India p. 21-22 ) seems inclined to hold that the 13th book which alone, according to him, reco gnises the sāstra declared by Manu, knew the present Manu smrti, though the earlier books cannot be held to have known a sāstra of Manu even when they employ such expressions as “Manu said.&rdquo; He thinks that there was a floating mass of verses containing philosophical and other lore attributed to the mythical Manu on which the earlier books of the Mahābhārata and the Manusmrti both drew and that the matter that is common to both works was not borrowed from any systematic treatise. Bühler accepts this view with the slight modification that the floating mass of verses was not all attributed to Manu ( S B E vol. 25 p. XC). Before giving my individual views on this vexed question as against the array of such eminent scholars as Bühler and Hopkins some facts must be clearly set forth. The Mahābhārata is nowhere men tioned by name in the Manusmrti, though the word &ldquo;itihāsa&rdquo; (in the plural ) occurs in Manu (III. 232 ). The Manusmrti mentions many historical and legendary personages, about most of whom the Mahābhārata contains similar stories. The following are the persons so mentioned in the Manus Angirasa (in II. 151–152, addressing his elders as &lsquo;putrakāḥ&rsquo;); Agastya (V. 22, in connection with sacrificing animals); Vena, Nahusa, Sudās Paijavana and Nimi (all in VII. 41 ); coming to grief through insolence ); Pșthu, Manu, Kubera and the son of Gādhi (VII. 42), benefiting by their good conduct ); Vasistha (in VIII. 110, taking an oath before king Paijavana ), Vatsa (in VIII. 116, undergoing fire ordeal ); Akşamālā and Sārangi (in IX. 23, though of low birth, respectively were united to Vasistha and Mandapāla ); Daksa (in IX. 128-129 ) gave his daughters to Dharma, Kāśyapa and Soma ); Ajigarta (in X, 105, who was ready to sacrifice his own son ); Vāmadeva (in X, 106, desired dog&rsquo;s flesh to save his life ); Bharadvāja (in X. 107, who accepted the gift of mans cows ); Viśvāmitra (in X. 108, who took from a Candāla&rsquo;s hand a dog&rsquo;s tes Pșthu is also mentioned (in IX. 44 ) as the husband of the earth and in IX. 314 Brāhmanas are credited with HD rips</p>

<p>made fire all-devourer, the ocean undrinkable and the waning (phthisical) moon to wax. Most of the names mentioned here go far back into Vedic antiquities. For example, Vasistha&rsquo;s oath occurs in Rgveda (VII. 104. 15367) and the Bșhaddevată (VI. 32-34 ), Ajigarta figures in the Aitareya brāhmana (VII. 16 ) and Angirasa&rsquo;s story occurs in the Tandyamaha brāhmana ( 13. 3. 24 ). Besides, the Manusmrti does not say that the stories are taken from the great epic. The Mahā bhārata also was not the first to originate these stories but is only a storehouse and encyclopaedia of the numerous popular traditions that were current in ancient India. When our Manu ( 9. 227 ) says that gambling was seen to have produced in former ages deep-rooted enmities, it is unnecessary to suppose that there is a reference to the Mahābhärata, for, from Vedic times the evil effects of gambling were known ( vide Rgveda X. 34 ) and even the Mahābhārata contains the same verse ( Udyoga 37. 19), though this fact was not noticed by Bühler. On the other hand, there are numerous passages in the Mahabharata scattered over almost all the poorvans, where occur such expressions as, ' Manur.abravid, &lsquo;the rājadharmas of Manu&rsquo;, &lsquo;the śāstra of Manu&rsquo; etc. Some of these passages agree with the extant Manusmrti, while some do not. Besides, there are hundreds of verses in the Mahabharata that are identical with the verses of the Manusmrti, though they are not expressly attributed to Manu. Dr. Bühler says that in the Vana, Sänti and Anusasana parviens alone he could identify either wholly or partly 260 verses with those of our Manu. What then is the conclusion ? Prima facie it should be, on account of all these abovementioned facts, against the Mahă bhārata and in favour of the Manusmrti being the earlier of the two. Hopkins at all events holds that the Avušāsana parva knew a Manusmrti essentially the same as we have now. Bühler expresses himself more cautiously and says that the Santi and Anusāsana parvane knew a Mānava-dharmaśāstra closely connected with the extant one, though not identical. Both are agreed that the earlier books when they speak of Menu are either referring to the Mānava-dharmasūtra or 16 the flouting mass of popular verses, but not to our Manu.</p>

<p>___ We must now closely examine the data. The Anusāsana parva distinctly speaks of &lsquo;a sistra declared by Manu&rsquo;.358 In the Säntiparva are quoted two ślokas sung by Manu in his own dharmas,&rsquo; one of which is identical with Manu369 (9. 321 ). In another place the Säntiparva speaks of the &lsquo;rājadharmas of Pracetasa Manu &lsquo;and quotes two verses therefrom.360 In the Dronaparva (7.1) Mānari arthavidyā&rsquo; is referred to and in Vanaparva the rājadharmas as proclaimed by Manu are referred to ( Vanaparva 35. 2. 21 ). In other places, the words Manu Svāyambhuva said&rsquo; occur (e. g. Santi 21. 12, Anushsana 114. 12, Vanaparva 180. 34-35, Adiparva 73. 9, 110. 32-36, Udyoga 37. 1-6). In most cases the words &lsquo;Manu said’occur without the appellation</p>
<p>• Svayambhuva&rsquo; or &lsquo;Prācetasa&rsquo; (e. g. Santi 78. 31, 88. 14-16, 121. 10-12, 152. 14, 152. 30, 266.5; Anusisana 44. 18 and 23, 65. 1 and 3, 67. 19, 68. 31, 88. 4, 115.52-53 ; Vanaparva 32. 39, Udyogaparva 40. 9-10, Adiparva 41. 31, 74. 39 ). The words</p>

<p>subjects are not guarded by the king, he shares in the 4th part of whatever sins they commit. Then some say that the whole sin is the king&rsquo;s,' while again some say he certainly shares in balf of them (the sins ); but on hearing the ordinance of Manu our view is that he shares in the 4th part of the sing. Here the author of the Anušāsana expressly says that he puts forward his own opinion after hearing Manu&rsquo;s ordinance. There is no doubt that the Anusāsana parva clearly refers in several places to the extant Manusmrti. In Anu. 19. 88-89 reference is made to those who know Dharmaśāstras about adultery. In Anu. 45. 17-20 reference is made to the Gathās declared by Yama and set down in Dharmaśāstras and one verse · Arse gomithunam &lsquo;is nentioned there, which is the game as Manu III. 53. In Anu. 20. 14 it is said that it is the view of Prajapati that women do not deserve independence and 20. 21 is almost the same as extant Manu 9. 3. Jayaswal arrives at this conclusion ( on p. 50 ): &lsquo;the main date may be regarded to be circa 150 B. C., the final revision and the present form would have been fixed by 100-150 A. C., not later.&rsquo; He seizes upon the word &lsquo;Senāpatya&rsquo; in Manu XII. 100. The word was placed first for preserving the regularity of the Sloka metre (in which the 5th letter in each pādu is required to be short ) as the wording Rajye ca Senapatye ca&rsquo; would have the fifth letter long. Further, Manu had already stated in several places the greatness and worth of brāhmanas e. g. Manu in I. 93 says &ldquo;Brāhmana is the lord of this whole creation, because be sprang from the mouth of the Creator as stuted in Rg. X. 90. 12), as he is the senior (among the four varnas ), as he preserves the Veda (by memorizing it) and since he propounds Dharma'. Vide also 1. 99-101 (which</p>

<p>occur also in Santi 72. 6, 10,11 first half ), also Manu VIII. 37, IX. 317, 319, X. 3. Further, there was the tradition of the Mahābhārata war that after Bhīşma was mortally wounded, Drona, a brāhmana teacher, was made commander-in-chief of the Kaurava army. The Drona parva expressly refers to the ceremony of abhiselca in the case of Drona as commander-in chief. Although, the Ap. Dh. S. (I. 10. 29. 7) states that a brāhmana should not take in his hand a weapon even for test ing it, that was an extreme view ; other Dharmasūtras (like Gautama VII.25, Baud. II.2.80, Vasistha III. 24 ) allowed a brāhmana to use arms in danger to life, for protecting cows and brāhmanas &amp;c. We learn from Pānini (V. 2. 71 ) that there were before his time brāhmanas as professional soldiers and he teaches that the word &ldquo;brāhmanaka' means a country in which brāhmanas follow the profession of arms. Kautilya (in A. IX. 2. 21-24 ) refers to armies of Brāhmanas, Ksatriyas, Vaisyas and Sūdras. Therefore, Jayaswal&rsquo;s remarks on Manu XII. 100 are worthless for settling the date of the Manusmrti. Jayaswal&rsquo;s &lsquo;Manu and Yājsavalkya&rsquo; is full of information, but it is sometimes marred by specious assumptions about ancient times for which there is hardly any solid basis. It would be impossible to deal with many such matters here for want of space. One matter, however, may be briefly men tioned here. Ou p. 288 of that work he propounds the somewhat startling proposition that Manu VIII. 169 shows that professional lawyers were already in existence in the time of the Māuava Code'. The verse is quoted below. It literally means &lsquo;three persons have to undergo trouble (in litigation ) for others viz. witnesses, sureties, kula (family members ); while four persons prosper or benefit (in litiga tion ) viz. the brābmana, the rich (i.e. the creditor who supplies money to the litigants ), the trader and the king. No word in this verse can mean a lawyer by itself. Vipra ordinarily means brāhmaṇa. Gaut. Dh. S. 13. 26, Manu VIII. 9 and Yāj. 11.3 expressly provide that when the king cannot himself look into the causes of his subjects, he may appoint as judge &amp; brāhmaṇa learned in the Dharmaśāstra, along with sabhyas. The Mit. quotes Katyayana to the effect that if a brāhmaṇa learned in the Dharmaśāstras cannot be found then &amp; Ksat. riya or Vaisya learned in Dharmaśāstras may be appointeca So the general rule was that a brāhmana was to be the presiding judge. He benefitted by litigation in the sense that he was paid his salury whatever the result of the litigation</p>
<ol start="31">
<li>The Manusmrti</li>
</ol>
<p>341</p>
<p>might be. The king benefitted by the receipt of the fines paid by the losing parties in litigations. The commentators do not say a word about a class of lawyers helping litigants for fees. Sarvajña Nārāyana and Ramacandra paraphrase &ldquo;vipra&rsquo; as prádvivāku; Kullūka und Govindarāja simply paraphrase &lsquo;vipra&rsquo; as brāhmana. Medhātithi&rsquo;s' text as printed is not clear, yet he commented that this verse has to be connected with the preceding verse that condemns the use of force and that&rsquo;vipru' should not be forced to accept a gift. So it is clear, that Manu and his commentators do not speak of a pro. fession of lawyers at all. Jayaswal refers to the Burmese code as giving a scale of fees (p. 288 n. 3). That may have been the law in ancient Burma and the Burmese might have grafted it on Manu, when they adopted Manu. He should have inentioned, if he wanted to place the matter on a sound footing, a Sanskrit Smrti setting out a scale of fees for law. yers. Hopkins says that the words &lsquo;the sāstra of Manu&rsquo; occur only in the Anusasana-parva and so only that parvan knew the Manusmști, while in the other parvuna we have the expression · Manu said,' and therefore these other books did not know the Manusmrti but are only referring to floating verses attributed to the mythical Manu. This, however, is not a reasonable conclusion. The words &lsquo;shstra of Manu&rsquo; occur only once even in the Anusūsana while in about ten places in the same parvien we come across only the words &lsquo;Manu said.&rsquo; If the words · Manu said' in the Anusagana indicate in the Anusãoana a reference to the extant Manusmrti, there is no cogent reason why the same words in other parvans should not be regarded as referring to the Manusinfti. Besides, in the Săntiparva also we meet with the words &lsquo;Dharmar or raja. dharmas of Manu&rsquo; and in Adiparva the word &lsquo;dharma-darsane&rsquo; ( 120. 32 ). There are some important references to Prācetasa Manu in the Mahābhārata, though in the Manusmrti no text or view is ascribed to him. The Sāntiparva (in chap. 58. 1-3 ) names seven propounders of Rajadharma viz. Brhagpati, Visålāksa, Kävya (Usanas ), Sahasrāksa, Mahendra, Prácetasa Manu, Bhäradväja and Gauraśiras, all of whom speak highly of protection (of subjects ) as, the (one) Dharma for kings. The great epic quotes the views of Pracetasa Manu in Santi ( 57.44-45 ) that Prácetas Manu set forth two verses in his work on Rajadharmas.) A reference to Pracetasn&rsquo;s dictumn in Anusisana 46. 1-2 to the842</p>

<p>effect that what the relations of a girl receive from the bride groom&rsquo;s side is not a sale but that it is really meant as honour to the girl and as to be paid over to the girl. This is almost the same as Manu III. 54. In Vana parva 35. 21 we have the words . you have heard the Rājadharmas that were declared by Manu.' This Manu must be Prācetasa since in Santi 58. 1-3 Prācetasa Manu is said to have been one of the expounders of Rūjaśāstra.</p>
<p>A remarkable reference to Viśālāksą as a writer on Niti (Rājanīti) is found in an inscription from Cambodia (No. 64 in &lsquo;Inscriptions of Kambuja&rsquo; edited by Dr. R. C. Majumdar ) in praise of Yasovarman, king of Kambuja, about 889 A. D. in a highly paronomastic verse.368 That is obviously a reference to some work of Manu. Hopkins further says ( Great Epic of India, p. 21 ) that all the express citations of Manu in the Anušāsana except one agree very closely with our Manu, while in the other parruns the citations agree only up to one-third or one-half. In the first place I demur to the latter statement. The agreements of the citations in the other books are as close and almost as frequent as in the Anušāsana, e. g. excepting Sānti 21. 12 and 57. 43-45 all citations of Manu therein, referred to above, agree closely with Manu 7. 89, 9. 225-26, 9. 17-19 and 27, 6. 33 and 81, 11. 259-60, 5. 43 and 45 and 48-49. The same is the case with the few citations of Manu in the Vanaparva. Bühler says that the Mahābhārata knew only of the dharmasūtras. But there is positively uot one express citation attributed by nane to the well-known writers of dharmasutras, such as Gautanna, Baudhāyana, Apastamba, Vasistha or Sarkha-Likbita. That the Mahabharata knew several dharmaģistras is clear from over a dozen references to dharmasastras, often in the plural (e. g. Sānti 167. 4, 298. 40, 341. 74; Anušāsana 19. 89, 45. 17-20; Vanaparva 207. 83, 293. 35, 313. 105; Adiparva 3. 32 and 77 etc.) The only place where a sūtrakāra is cited on matters of dhurma is Anu. 19.6; but no name is mentioned. 388 382 पारदः स्थिरकल्याणो गुणाढ्यः प्राकृताप्रियः । अनीतिर्यो विशालाक्षः शरो</p>

<p>Hastisútra, and Asvasūtra are mentioned in Sabhū 5. 20, but no Dharmasūtra or Nitisūtra occurs anywhere. On the other hand Bühler is not prepared to admit that the views expressly attributed to Manu in the Mahābhārata are taken from a treatise and refers them to a floating mass of verses the authorship of which was unknown and was fathered upon the mythical Mapu. Distrust of ancient Indian authors could gono further. A volume would have to be written to expose the mis takes, underlying the assumptions and fallacies in the writings of Hopkins, Bühler and soine other Western scholars. The former collects two groups of passages from the Manusmrti; group A containing 9 passages, 8 of which he admits to be ancient and holds Manu VI. 54 ( uhout Yatipātras including &lsquo;alābu&rsquo;) to be doubtful and group B with 13 passages ( 3 he holds ancient, 5 doubtful and 5 others suspicious ). It is impossible to agree with Hopkins in many cases which he treats as doubtful. For example, he cites Manu VIII. 59 as contradictiny VIII. 139 and therefore be suspects that VIII. 139 is not genuine Manu. It has been shown above that Manu makes contradictory statements on some matters such es the practice of niyoga and the validity of the marriage of &amp; brāhmana with a sūdra woman. Besides, the apparent con tradiction is easily resolved, if we hold that VIII. 59 lays down a general rule for fines and VIII. 139 contains grecial rules about debts only viz. if the defendant admits in court his indebtedness but has not paid the debt, then the fine for him is five panas for each hundred of debt, but if he denies the debt he should be fined ten panas for each hundred of debt (proved ). Besides, Hopkins has inisunderstood words like Manur-abravit or-āla. Those words have not a single meaning, but are capable of several explanations; firstly, a quotation may be meant; secondly, ouly the gist of Manu&rsquo;s words ( but not his exact words ) may be intended; thirdly, the quotation may be only what the writer remembers of the original text of Manu and fourthly, he may think that what he states is the proper rule and enhances its authority by escribing it to Manu. Bühler&rsquo;s assumptions are, to say the</p>

<p>least, gratuitous and are prompted by his unwillingness to assign an early date to a versified smrti of Manu. Not only are there identical verses in Manu and the Mahābhārata, but some verses of the latter (e. g. Udyoga 35. 31 and Sänti 111. 66 ) occur in the Nāradasmrti (pp. 103 and 26 respecti vely ). In my humble opinion the following seems to be the relation of the Mahābhārata and the Manusmrti. I must state frankly that it is a mere theory, a conjecture which may be taken for what it is worth. Long before the 4th century B. C., there was a work on Dharmaśāstra composed by or attributed to Svāyambhuva Manu. This work was most probably in verse. There was also another work on Raja dharma attributed to Prācetasa Manu, which also was prior to the 4th century B. C. It is not unlikely that instead of there being two works there was one comprehensive work embody ing rules on dharma as well as on politics. There is one circumstance that points in this direction. The Mahābhārata quotes a saying (vacana ) of Pracetasa which is almost the same as our Manu 364 ( 3. 54 ). It is to these ( works or work) that Yāska, Gautama, Baudhāyana, and Kautilya refer whenever they cite the opinions of Manu or the Mānavas. The Mahābhārata also (particularly in the earlier portions ) probably refers to the same. This work was the original kernel of the present Manusmrti. Then between 2nd century</p>
<p>B. C. and 2nd century A. D. the Manusmrti was finally recast probably by Bhrgu That work must have compressed the older works in some cases and expanded it in others. This</p>

<p>hypothesis would explain why some of the verses and views quoted as Manu&rsquo;s occur in the extant Manusmrti and why some do not.365 In my opinion the extant Mahābhārata is later than the extant Manusmrti. When Närada mentions the tradition that Sumati Bhārgava coinpressed the vest work of Manu into 4000 verses, he is somewhat obscurely hinting at the truth. The extant Manusmrti contains only about 2700 verses. Narada probably arrives at the larger figure by including the verses attributed to Vțddha-Manu and Brhan-Manu. If Vrddha-Manu was a separate work it must have been composed before at least the 7th century A. D. at the latest. Visvarūpa on Yāj. I. 69 (p. 75, Trivandrum ed. of 1922 ) quotes two verses on niyoga. The Mit. on Yāj. II. 270 (first half) and 272, III, 5, 20 (latter half), 260 quotes a few verses of Vrddha-Manu, while Apararka quotes him twenty times and on p. 908 quotes Manu II. 67 and immediately afterwards quotes a verse of Vșddha-Manu. Kalpataru on Vya. quotes Vrddha-Manu eight times, but in one case (on p. 402) one half of the verse is the same as Manu VIII. 157 (first hall). The Smșticandrikā quotes Vrddha-Manu verses 23 times on ācāra, 6 times on Vyavahāra and 12 times on Srāddha.</p>
<p>Brhan-Manu is cited by the Mitāksară only a few times i.e. on YĀj. II.135-36 (11 verses on limits of sapinda and tamānodaka relationship ), on YÃj. III. 20 (latter half) two verses on āśauca. Aparārka cites Brhau-Manu only once (on p. 910 ) on Asauca. The influence of the Manusmrti spread even beyond the confines of India. In A. Bergaigne&rsquo;s Inscriptions Sanscrites de Campā et du Cambodge' (p. 423 ) we have an inscription in which occur verses, 366 one of which is identical</p>

Besides these, Nārāyana, Raghavānanda, Nandana and Rāmacandra also wrote commentaries on Manu. Mr. Mandlik published all these commentaries. Dr. Jolly publish ed ( in 1885 for the Bengal Asiatic Society ) extracts from all these commentaries (except Kullūka&rsquo;s and Ramacandra&rsquo;s ) and from an anonymous Kashmirian commentary on the first three chapters. Asahāya seems to have written a commentary on Manu (vide below section on him). The Vivādaratnākara quotes a commentary on Manu by Udayakara ( pp. 455, 560, 583, 590).

He does not comment on some verses such 48 on Manu III. 174 and 278 (Mandlik&rsquo;s ed.). He is generally brief in his comments but he has longer notes than Medhātithi or Kullūka on Manu V. 16, 31, 56, VI. 34-35, 67, X. 42, XI. 130. He is later than Govindarāja and Aouri shed betweon 1100 and 1300 A. D. Raghavananda men tions by name Medhatithi, Govindarāja, Nārāyana, and Kullūka and so is later than about 1400 A. D. When Nandana flourished it is difficult to say. But he is a late writer. There are several other commentators mentioned in the catalogues of mss. who may be passed over for want of space.</p>
<p>The Tantravārtika (p. 159) after dealing with the use fulness of the Veda ( which is constituted by Vidhi, Arthavāda, Mantra and Nāmadheya ) for understanding what Dharma is, comes to the consideration of Smrtis such as those of Manu and others that have human authors. It further quotes the words Vedoskhilo Dharmamūlam&rsquo; (Manu 2. 6 and 7 ) and concludes from the words of these passages that the Smartřs (i. e. Smrtikāras ) have bound themselves by stating that Veda is the source of Dharma. The Tantra vārtika further says that the Smrtikáras ( v. 205 ) accept th.</p>
<p>ess of usages that are not opposed to the Ved. in such passages as are quoted above. Similarly, Mānavam (i.e. Manusmrti) states in 12. 105, 106 that one who desires to find out the pure Dharma has to rely upon Prutyakşu and Anu māna, and that man really knows Veda who makes use of logic in interpreting Veda. The Tantravārtika (p. 191 ) further quotes a passage as of Manu which does not occur in the present Manu but occurs in the MBH, Santiparva 140.38, which states that a man should first extricate himself from distress by any action, soft or hard, and then when he becomes able, should practise what Dharma requires. Similarly, Sabara on P. M. S. VI. 1. 12 quotes a verge as Smrti which is almost the same as the extant Manu (8. 416 ) and which is also similar to Udyogapurva, ch. 33.64. For further referepet to Manu, vide the present author&rsquo;s paper in JBBRAS NEW Series, 1925 ) Vol. I pp. 98-102.

<p>different from the extant Manu. For example, on p. 191 he quotes &amp; verse as Manu&rsquo;s which does not occur in the extant Smrti.</p>
<p>The above discussion shows that the extant Manusmrti was practically the same long before the 7th century A. D.</p>
<p>It may be noted that Sabaragvāmin on PMS. VI. 1. 12 quotes a verse as Smộti which is practically the same as extant Manu VIII. 116. Sabara has to be placed between 200 and 400 A. D. (nearer the former date); vide H. of Dh. Vol. V. p. 1197. Hence the extant Manusmrti cannot be placed later than 2nd century A. D.

<p>Višvarūpa ( on Yrij. I. 69 ), the Mitākṣarā, the Smộtica ndrikā, the Parāśarainadhaviya and other works quote dozens of verses from Vrddha&ndash;Manu on ühnika, vyavahāra and prāyuscittu. The Mitūksară (on Yāj. II. 135-6, III. 20 ), Aparārka p. 910 and other works cite a few verses from Brhan Manu. No independent works going under these names have yet been unearthed. Those works, if they ever existed independently, appear to have been later than our Manu. For example, our Manu is silent about the widow&rsquo;s right to inherit to her husband, but Vệddha-Manu recognises the right of a chaste widow to take the entire wealth of her husband (Mit. on Yäj. II. 136); similarly, Bșhan-Manu ( according to the Mit. ) seems to refer to Manu&rsquo;s view about the meaning of &lsquo;gamānodaka&rsquo; (Manu 5. 60 ) and modifies it. It is not unlikely that those verses which were not recognised 28 Manu&rsquo;s by ancient commentators like Medhatithi and were yet found in the msg. of the Manusmrti were regarded as Vrddha-or Bphan-Manu.</p>

<p>Bhārata means the epic without the upākhyānas ( tales ) and contaius 24000 verses and the work Mahābhūrata consists of one hundred thousand verses inclusive of the upākhyānas ( Adi. 1.101-2). The Adiparva (63.89-90) states that Vyāsa 37a taught the four Vedas together with the Mahābhūruta as the fifth to four pupils viz. Sumantu, Jaimini, Paila, Vaišampā. yana and to Suka his own son and these five promulyated separate five versions of the story. The Säntiparva (chap. 327. 26-33 and 349. 10-12 ) repeats the same story about the five pupils of Vyāsa. The extant Mahabharata is supposed to be the one that Vaišampāyana narrated to Janamejaya, son of Parikșit, the latter being the grand-son of Arjuna and son of Abhimanyu. It is said in Adi ( 1.9-10 ) that Sauti heard the story narrated to Janamejaya and told it to Saunaka and other sages. Thus there are (acc. to the epic itself) three stages, viz. (1) Vyasa first transmitted the epic to five pupils ; (2) these five including Vaiśumpāyana composed separate works and Vaisampayana narrated it to Janamejaya, and (3) Sakti who heard the recital by Vaišampāyana narra</p>

<p>In the daily tarpana as prescribed in the Aévalāyana grbya-sūtra 374 (III. 4 ) we find an echo of what we learn from the Adiparva about the four pupils (excluding Suke ) of Vyāsa viz. Sumantu - Jaimini - Vaišampāyana - Paila - Sūtra - bhāsya - Bhārata - Mahābhārata - Dharmācāryas - trpyaptu. Asvalāyana was probably aware of the difference made bet ween Bhārata and Mahābhārata. The Śănkhāyanagặhya omits the words ' Bhārata&hellip;&hellip;Dharmācāryāḥ'.</p>
<p>In the present edition (of the H. of Dh.) the Chitrasalā edition of the Mahābhārata with the commentary, Bhārata bhāvadīpa of Nilākantha Caturdhara, has been used. It generally agrees with the Bombay oblong edition ; sometimes, however, there is a difference of one adhyāya or a sloka or two. The Bhandarkar 0. Institute&rsquo;s edition is not referred to, be cause when I collected my materials it had been only recently begun and even now it is not yet complete, though nearing completion.* But, as that edition gives in the margin of each page, references to the text of three editions of the epic, it is easy to find out a passage from the text of that edition also.</p>

<p>Many difficult questions arise about the two epics ( which have come down to us in different recensions ), such as the origin and development of the two epics, the inter-relation of the two, the dates of the two epics; the strata, if any, in the two epics; the literature known to them, their versification ; their influence on the early and later Dharmaśāstra works ; their influence in comparatively early times on peoples beyond India. A great deal has been written on these topics by Western and Indian writers for over a century. Considerations of space make it impossible to enter upon the detailed discu ssion of the questions stated above. Yet a few remarks must, be made on some of the topics discussed by scholars. The following works and papers will give some idea of the prob lems connected with these two heirlooms of Indian antiquitaine &quot; Zur Geschichte and Critik des Mahābhārata &quot; by Holtzmit (Kiel, 1892-94 );' Das Rāmāyana, Geschichte und Inhalt &lsquo;Apa YUMO Dr. Jacobi ( Bonn, 1893 ), &lsquo;The Great Epic of India&rsquo; by Premiere E.

<p>It would not be proper to say nothing in this work about some of the vexed and important questions concerning the two epics, such as the approximate dates of the two, the inter-relation of the two and the question of the existence of different strata in them. These questions are inseparably intermixed and cannot be dealt with separately. Some points will first be brought out and briefly discussed and then the present author will state his own conclusions for whatever they may be worth. Winternitz (in History of Indian Litera ture' Calcutta, 1927, p. 469 ) went so far as to say that each stanza of the Mahābhārata must be judged on its own merits' and Sukthankar remarks that this is so &lsquo;when we want to use the stanza for historical and comparative purposes&rsquo; and he points out (on p. 475 of Kane Festschrift ) that even a pont scholar like Oldenberg commits abysmal mistakes in the esti mate of the age and character of the passages of the Maha bhārata,</p>

<p>It is clear that the Mahābhārata had become, long before the 7th century A. D., a work for popular education and was being recited before general audiences of men and women in India as in the 19th century. For example, on p. 61 of Peterson&rsquo;s edition of the Kadambari, 376 it is said that the queen Vilāgavati learnt when the epic was being recited that the son saves his father from Put hell. Similarly, it is stated in the Kādambari (p. 71 ) that the one thousand names of Nārāyana used to be recited continuously. The Kādambari (p. 90) refers to the famous Gita dleclared by Krsua, one of whose names is • Ananta'. Going further backwards, we find in the famous Besnagara376 Columu Inscription (set out in JRAS for 1909 p. 1055 ) of the 2nd century B. C. of Helio dorus, a devotee of Vasudeva and a Yona ( yavana ) ambas sador from the Greek king Antalikita to the court of king Bhaga-bhadra. The last portion in Prakrit words is &lsquo;dama, cāga, appamāda ' ( dama, tyāga and apranada), which occur in Udyogaparva 43.22 and Striparva 7. 23. 376 महाभारते वाच्यमाने श्रुतं पुन्नाम्नो नरकात्रायत इति पुत्र इति । कादम्बरी, p. 81</p>

<p>History of Dharmaśāstra</p>
<p>It has been shown above that the Asv. gr. sūtra, which represents the last phase of Vedic literature, includes the ācāryas of Bharata, Mahābhārata and Dharma among the sages in the daily tarpuņa. The Märkandeya-purana starts by saying that it has four doubts as to Bharata (vide H. of Dh. Vol. V, p. 901 for the four questions and p. 903 for the date ). The Mrcchakatika (III. 12 ) refers to the Sauptika parva ( mārgo hyesa narendra-Sauptikavadhe pūrvam kặto Drauninā). In several places where the Vedāntasūtra relies on Smrti for support Sarkarācārya quotes only verses from the Mahābhārata.377 For example, on V. S. II. 3. 47 ( smaranti ca ) he quotes only two verses of the Mahabharata. Vide note below. This establishes that Sarkarācārya held that the Mahābhārata including the Sāntiparva ( which modern critics regard as interpolated later ) was earlier than the Vedānta sutra. The present author has attempted to establish that when the Gită ( in 13.4 ) speaks of Brahmasutrapadas it does not refer to the Brahmasūtra of Būlarāyana but to several Brahmasutras such as those of Bādari, Audulomi and Asma rathya ( vide H. of Dh. Vol. V. pp. 1173-74). Sabara in his bhâsya on the Pūrvamimumsi-sūtra quotes passages from the present Mahābhāratza text; vide a paper in Sukthankar volume pp. 221-229 by Prof. V. M. Apte and D. V. Garge.</p>
<p>Before proceeding further it must first be emphasized that the Mahābhārata claims to be itihāsa (history ) as stated above, while the Ramayana is a kavya as expressly stated in the Rāmāyana itself several times and as comparatively early</p>

<p>The words Gūtha and śloka occur in the Rgveda. Gathā ( derived from the root gai' to sing) means a song or verse. Vide Rg. VIII.32.1, VIII. 71.14, VIII.98.9, X.99.4, IX.85.6 for gåtha. The word Sloka occurs more frequently in the Rgveda than the word gathā and means a verse. In the Mahā bhārata Gathas sung by the Pitrs ( Anusāsana, 88.11-14), by Yama (Anu. 45.17 and 104.72 ) or by Janaka (Sinti 17.18-20), by Kaśyapa ( about Ksami, Vana parva 29.35-44), Gāthā about Paurava in Drona (57. 11 ) and about Bhagiratha (in Drona 60.8), of Yayati (in Sånti 26.13 and in Drona 63.8-9 ), gāthās sung by Ambarisa and by Alarka (in Asvamedhika 31. 12ff and 30. 30-31 respectively), by Brhaspati (Santi 23.14&ndash;15),by Brahman (Santi 136, about king&rsquo;s treasury ), gāthās sung by Usanas on distrust (Santi 138.192 ) and many more occur. Slokas also are quoted with the words Slokau cātra bhavatah' (Vanaparva 192.27-29 ) or &lsquo;bhavanti cătra ślokāh&rsquo; as in Vana</p>

<p>parva (199. 13-15); Slokas by one who ponders over dharma as in Sauptika ( 1.53-55). Then many slokas and gāthās are quoted as Anuvassa or simply as Anuvassam (meaning genealogies handed down in families ) e. g. Vanaparva 129. 8 says&rsquo;atrānuvamsam pathatah śruņu me kurunandana' and then quotes two verses. For ' Anuvamsam,' vide also Vana parva 87. 16-17 (yatrānuvainsam bhagavān Jāmadagnyag tathā jagau). For Anuvaṁsa slokas, vide Adiparva 95.8 ( for song878 of Devayani and Sarmiştha ).</p>
<p>For other Anuvamsa Slokas, vide Adi. 95. 27, 95. 30-31, 95.46 ( about Santanu ). In Vana parva 88.5 there is an anu vaṁsya gāthā about Nrga. Sometimes, even itihāsa is spoken of as sung i.e. recited (gīta ). The word itihāsa is ancient. It occurs in the Atharvaveda, 380 in the Sata patha-Brāhmana (XI. 1. 6.9), in the Bșhadāraṇyaka and Chandogya Upanigads (III. 4. 2, VII. 2. 1 respectively).</p>
<p>The above brief statement is quite enough to show that before the Mahābhārata was composed there were numerous verses landed down in families and that the Mahabharata utilizes and incorporates a large mass of ballads and bardic verses preserved in many prominent families. The Rāmāyana, on the other hand, is a Kävya and not an itihara and is con fined to the life of Rāma, his brothers and their vicissitudes.</p>

<p>Patañjali&rsquo;s Mahābhāsya we learn a good deal about some of the prominent personages of the Mahābhārata, their associates, enemies and their doings.</p>
<p>There are in the Rāmāyana hardly any Anuvamsya ślokas referring to Dasaratha or Rama. According to tbe Sarvánu kramaņi Rāma, son of Jamadugni, is the seer of Rg. X. 110. Rāma appears to be the name of some person in Rgveda X. 93.14. Rūma Mārgaveya is the name of a person of the priestly family of Syåparna in the Ait. Br. VII. 5. 1.</p>
<p>In Pan. IV. 3. 98 Vasudevaka, 381 a devotee of Vāsudeva, and Arjunaka (a devotee of or one who likes Arjuna ) are derived in the sense of bhakti&rsquo; (IV. 3. 95). In VIII. 3. 95 (gaviyudhibh yām 382 sthirah ) the nome Yudhisthira, one of the principal personages in Mahābhārata, is mentioned. On Vārtika 7 (bhrātusca jyāyasah) on Pin. II. 2. 34 (&lsquo;alpac taram&rsquo;) Patañjali states the example' Yudhişthirărjunau,' where the word Yudhisthira is put before Arjuna, though it has four vowels, because of his being the elder. In VI. 2. 38 Pärini provides for the accent (svara) of &lsquo;mahān&rsquo; occurring in the compound Mahābhārata ( along with nine other words ). Vārtika 7 on Pan. IV, 1. 85 provides for the name : Asvat thảmah.' Kielhorn brings together (in I. A. vol. XIV pp. 326-27 ) all the verse quotations ( of either whole verses or half verses or pādas ) cited by Patañjali in the Mahābhāsya.</p>

The Mahābhāsya explains that Vasudeva is not merely the naine of a Kyatriya but that it is # designation of the Divine. ya gramat FTT: 1 91. VIII. 3. 95 ( examples fafer: TETET:). The word &lsquo;Bhakti&rsquo; in the sense of worship occurs in ASTRITET97 VI. 23. The word of th: relates back to the Paart: ( 91. IV. 3,89) and also reaches forward. Therefore bhakti' in &ldquo;Pāṇini' has a wider sonse than mere worship; it also means &lsquo;resort&rsquo;, &lsquo;liking&rsquo; as in ' A pupika'( npūrā bhaktir-anya ), the songe of object of worship is not excluded from the word &lsquo;bhakti&rsquo; in Panini, but that word in larger in meaning than worship’in Panini. Therefore, in IV. 3. ( Vasudevārjunäbbykin run) it is quite correct to tell</p>

<p>History of Dharmaśāstra</p>
<p>On Pān. 1V. 1. 97 ( sulhätur-akañ ca ) the first vārtika is &ldquo;Sudhātr-vyñsayoh' and we get Vaiyñsakih' ( as son of Vyāsa ) i. e. Suka ‘and Mahābhāsya on it says Vaiyasakiḥ Sukaḥ'). Some of the verses or their parts are very important and interesting about the heroes of the Mahābhārata. On Vārtika 22 on Pān. II. 2. 24 we have two quotations, viz.</p>
<p>asidvitiyosnusasāra Pāndavam' (he, armed only with a sword, followed the Pandu hero ) and &lsquo;Sarkarsana-dvitiyasya balam Kșsnasya vardhatim&rsquo; (in this both Krona and his brother Sankarsana are mentioned ). The first quotation (on II. 2. 24 ) clearly shows that it must have been taken from some work dealing with Pandava heroes. Another interesting quotation is &lsquo;Dhanañjayo rane rane&rsquo; on' Vārtika 3 on Pán. III. 3. 58. It is well-known that Arjuna was called Dhananjaya (vide Bhagavadgitā X. 37 Pāņdavānām Dhananjayaḥ').</p>
<p>On Vārtika 11 on Pān. IV. 2. 104 Patañjali cites the wordsAkrüra-vargyah' and &lsquo;Akrūravarginah&rsquo; as well as Vāsudev&amp;-vargyah and Väsudevavarginah. This reminds one of the dialogue between Krona and Nārada reported in Santi parva, chap. 81. It appears from that chapter that there was jealousy among the Yādavas.383 Akrüra and Ahukax were two chiefs among the Andhaka-Vrsnis ( verse 8 ) and Krsna was the President of that Sangha and that Narada advises Krsna that a sangha comes to grief from internal dissensions (verse 25 ) and that Krsna should act in such a way as not to lead to the destruction of the Sarigha. Pān. (IV. 1. 114 ) knew the Andhaka vrsnis and Kurus and Patañjali on Vārtika 7 cites and explains the words Augrasenya ( from Ugrasena of the Andhaka clan ), Väsudeva and Baladeva ( among Vronis ) and Nākula, Sähadeva and Bhaimasenya ( among the Kuru clan )</p>
<p>383</p>

<p>From the above brief references in Pāṇini and Patañjali one may affirm that the central story of the Mahābhārata is certainly older by centuries than the story of the Rāmāyana. Reference has been made to the fact that there is a Rāmopā khyāna in Vanaparva (chap. 273-292 containing about 750 verses ). It does not completely agree with the present Rāmāyaṇa text. In this Kumbhakarņa is said to have been killed by Ráma ( Yuddha. 67. 180-181 ), while in the Ramopå khyāna it is Laksmana who does 80 ( Vanaparva 287.18-19 ). Besides, in the Santiparva (chap. 29 ) there is a brief reference to Rāma&rsquo;s rule for 11000 years and the ideal happiness of the people under his rule. In the Dronaparva also Rāma is briefly referred to in the Sodasa -rājakiya section (chap. 55-71, that relating to Rāma being chap. 59). Stray references to a few other incidents of the Rāma story may be made here. For example, Rāma being led to pursue the gold-coloured deer ; the Sāntiparva refers briefly to the story of Sambūka. The Salyaparva mentions that Rama cut off the head of a räksasa and the Santi refers to the killing of Rāvana by Rāma through anger (361. 15 ).884</p>
<p>Hopkins refers to certain passages where Vālmiki is mentioned in the Mahābhārata and divides them into two classes. In the first class he puts certain references to Val miki as meant for a mere saint (a pội), as in Sabhā 7. 16, Vanaparva 85. 119, Udyoya 93. 27, śānti 207. 4 (along with Asita, Devala and many others ). In my opinion Anusāsana 13.8 ( where Vālmīki is styled bhagavān) belongs to this first category. Then Hopkins mentions &lsquo;four passages as referring&rsquo; directly to the Rāmāyaṇa (vide the great Epic of India&rsquo;) pp. 61 ff).</p>

<p>Before proceeding to examine these four passages relied upon by Hopkins a few words must be said about the present text of the Mahābhārata. There are three elements in it, viz. the bare story of the Pandava - brothers and their cousins (usually referred to as Kauravas ), the upākhyānas ( abound ing in the Vanaparva and scattered about in other parvans also ) concerning gods, sages, brāhmanas, kings and others and didactic matter insisting on doing one&rsquo;s duties and the role of dharma as in Udyoga 148. 16 &lsquo;yato dharmastato jayaḥ&rsquo; and in Kunti&rsquo;s last message to Yudhisthira in Asramavāsika parva 17.21 Dharme te dhiytām budhir-manastu mahad-astu ca' and philosophy (Sankhya, Yoga, Vedānta ). There was, therefore, great scope at all times for adding stories and didactic matters. Thus the Mahābhārata became very much inflated by additions made at different times. Anyone could add a story by saying &lsquo;atrāpyudāharantimam itihăsam purātanam&rsquo;. In the Anusāsana parvan alone in 25 chapters stories are introduced with these words, apart from several stories introduced in a different manner. Chap. 98 of that parvan is remarkable. There Bhisma introduces ( in the words &lsquo;atrāpyudīharanti&rsquo;) the story of a dialogue between Manu Prajāpati and one Suvarna who asks how the practice of the worship of deities with flowers originated and what the rewards of such worship are. Then Manu cites the story (again with the words &lsquo;atrāpyu&rsquo; etc.) of the dialogue between Sukra and Bali Vairocana. Two examples may be cited about Rāma story being interpolated by devotees and enthusiasts. In chap. 74 of the Anuśñsana, apart from the evil results of the killing of a cow, the merit issuing from the gifts of cows or gold is praised and the chapter is wound up (verses 11-14) by Bhīşma who says that he learnt all this from bis Upā dhyāya to whom it came from the sages, to whom Laksmana imparted the story in the forest which Rāma had heard from his father Daśaratha who learnt it from Indra. Another similar example occurs in chap. 137 of the same parvan, which names numerous great men of the past that achieved highest worlds hy making gifts of various kinds, among whom Rāma (in verse 14), son of Dasaratha, is mentioned as having reached inexhaustible worlds by offerings in yajñas.</p>
<p>Not only were tales interpolated but there are everal repetitions in the Mahābhārata. A few examples may be noted. There is in Sānti ( chap. 227 ) an enlarged version of</p>

<p>the brief dialogue between Indra and Bali in chap. 223; chap. 175 ( dialogue between father and son ) is practically the same as chap. 277. Salya 38. 39-45 are the same as Vanaparva 83. 116-121. The Sodasarājakiya occurs twice, once in the Droņa parva (chap. 55–71) and again in the Kantiparva chap. 29. The story of Āstika occurs twice, iu Adi 13ff and in chap. 48ff again.</p>
<p>The literature known to the Mahabharata furnishes some data for making a statement about the probable date of the extant text of the epic. But as the present text is very much inflated owing to additions made at different times, it would be impossible to assign definite dates, and references to Vedas and Brāhmana works need not be cited. The six Angas are mentioned in Adi. 170. 75. In Säuti 312. 38 the Naighantu ka-padas are mentioned and the word Vrsa therein. The Nirukta of Yaska and its explanation of the word ' sipivista ' ( which occurs in Rg. VII. 100. 65-7) is mentioned in the Säntiparva.386 The Nirukta (V.8) gives the explanation of the word provided by Aupamanyava which is derogatory ( to Vişnu), wbile Yāska appears to prefer a laudatory sense and applies the word to Vişnu (as Surya), meaning &lsquo;in which rays enter on all sides )&rsquo;. The Sänti (310. 21-22 ) mentious that Bphaspati knew (composed ? ) the Vedāngas, Bhargava Niti sāstra ( politics ), Nárada music ( Gándharva ), Bhāradvāja archery, Gārgya the doings of Devull, Kronātreya medicine, and some disputants ( composed ) several sidehāntas based on logic (such as Tärkika, Vaiseşika and Kápila ). It will be stat ed in the section on Manusmrti how hundreds of verses are common to the Mabābhārata and the Manusmrti. In the Anušāsana we have (in 47.35 ) mention of the Sāstra declared by Manu. Itihasa and Purāna are called the fifth Veda as early as the Chándogya Up. VII. 1. 2-4 and the Satapatha Brāhmana requires that in the Pāriplava some Purana and Itihāsa passages were to be recited on the 8th and 9th days respectively. Therefore, the numerous references to Purāna in the Great Epic are not here set out. It is important to note that a Purāna declared by Väyu is mentioned in Vana Parva (191. 16). The Svargarohanaparva ( 5. 46-47 ) states that there are 18 Puranas composed by Krsna Dvaipāyana.</p>

<p>The word &lsquo;Dharmaśāstresu&rsquo; occurs frequently as shown above (vide pp. 13, 300-1 ). Individual writers on Dharma sāstra ( apart from Manu ) are also quoted e. g. Yama in Santi 82. 31, Aigiras ( two verses ) in Santi 69. 71-73; Usanas on slaying an atatāyin386 ( a desperado like an incendiary or a</p>

<p>In Anusāsana 18. 38 Garga is said to have obtained the knowledge of the sixty-four Kalas (arts) and in Salya-parva 37. 145 Garga is said to have gained on the banks of Sarasvati knowledge of kāla and about the movements of heavenly bodies. Astronomer Garga is assigned to 50 B. C. by Kern ( vide Preface to Brhat-samhita p. 50)and H. of Dh. Vol. V pp. 79 and 592 n 878.</p>
<p>It appears that by the time the Mahābhārata assumed its present form Buddhist and Jain ideas had acquired influence among the people. For example, the Vanaparva387 ( 181.42-43) says &lsquo;truthfulness, self-restraint, tapas, charity, ahimsa, constant adherence to dharma, these are the means (of higher life ) ainong men, not caste nor family.&rsquo; Santiparva says</p>

<p>(188. 10 ) &lsquo;there is no difference among the (four) varṇas; this world is Brāhma (belongs to Brahmă ), because it was formerly created by Brahmā and was, (later) reduced to differ ent varṇas by their (diverse) actions&rsquo;. The Santiparva annou nces Truthfulness, charity, freedom from hatred and wickedness, humility, kindness and tapas,-where these are seen, he is known as brāhmana. If these characteristics are found in a südra and these do not exist in a twice-born person then the Sūdra is not a südra and the so-called brāhmaṇa is not a brāhmaṇa. This approaches the teaching of the Dha mmapada verses 383, 393 (yamhi satyam ca dhammo ca 80 sukhi 80 ca brāhmanah). Similiarly, in Anušāsana 115 Yudhisthira asked Bhisma &lsquo;you have often declared that ahimeâ is the highest dharma and you also said that in śrāddhas the pitre desire to have flesh offered&rsquo;. Buddhist vibāras ( Vana° 188. 56 ) had come into existence and Eļūkas (structures over the bones of the dead); are mentioned in Vana parva ( 90. 65, 67). A naked Ksapanaka ( Digambara Jain) is mentioned in Adi 3. 126; in Santi 232. 21388 the Jain posi tion seems to have been alluded to and also in Afvamedhika 49. 2. In Adiparva 70. 46 it is stated that in Kanva&rsquo;s hermi tage there were leaders of Lokāyatika views along with students of Vedas and Moksadharma.</p>

The Mahābhāsya asks the question bow one can use the present tense (in Kamsam ghātayati) when Kamsa was killed in antiquity.

<p>Kamsa by Kęsụa. That some verses quoted by the Maha bhāsya are found in the Mahabharata is shown in the note below. 380</p>
<p>The date of the Mahābhāsya is generally accepted to be about 150 B, C.; vide (pp. 75-79 above). It quotes a quarter of a verse stating that some person followed the Pandava hero with only a sword in his hand and Pāṇini knows the central figures of the great Epic viz. Yudhisthira and Arjuna. It has been shown above (p. 75 ) that Panini flourished about 450 to 400 B.C. Therefore, it follows that there were poems about Pandava heroes and about Krsna killing Kamsa some time before 400 B. C. Scholars would have to assign 500 B. C. as the latest date for the core of the Mahābhārata.</p>
<p>Another circumstance pointing to the same conclusion is that the Asv. Gș. mentions &quot; Bhārata-Mahābhārata dharmă cāryāḥ'. The Gșhyagūtras belong to the latest phase of the Vedic literature. The mention of Bhārati and Mahābhārata as preceding the Āśv. Gș. would make it very probable that the Mahābhārata was in existence at least just before the end of the Vedic period.</p>

<p>such stanza must be judged on its own merits'. But life being short, this would be an almost impossible task for one scholar for the one hundred thousand stanzas of the Mahābhārata.</p>
<p>But if we turn to the Rāmāyana, none of the great per sonages depicted in that epic such as Daśaratha, Rāma, Laks mana, Bharata (Rama&rsquo;s brother ), Hanāmat, Sugriva, Bibhisana is inentioned by Pāņini or in quotations cited in the Mahābhāsya. Those who want to argue that the present Rāmāyaṇa was known to Patañjali rely on a few matters, such as the reference to Kiskindhi and two verses891 about Vānarasainyu in the Mahābhāsya. These two verses do not occur in the Rāmāyana at all; besides, here &ldquo;Vänarasainya' does not necessarily mean an &lsquo;army of monkeys&rsquo;; it may play. fully be applied to a crowd or number of monkeys; and moreover such verses illustrating the use of the same root in the Parasmaipada and Ātmanepada might have been com posed by a teacher of grammar for the benefit of his pupils. As there is a parody of Dasaratha, Rāma and Sită in the Dasarathajätaka, it is probable that some decades before 250 B. C. there existed a popular story about these three. Some further remarks will be made in the section on Rāmā yana.</p>

<p>yat-syāt kartavyam eva tat' (Dronaparva 14.67-68 ).32 The criticisms against this citation are several. One is that what is quoted is not a Sloka at all, but only a pāda (quarter) at the most; secondly, the Sloka in the Rāmāyana does not amount to an absolute rule, but there is a counterpoise in the latter half of the śloka ; another criticism is that the Maha bhārata itself had already stated in the Adiparva and Vana parva the same rule against killing a woman. So it is proba ble that some interpolator mentioned it in the Dronaparva to show off his knowledge of the other epic. As regards the 2nd citation I am sorry to say that Hopkins is carried away by his enthusiasm to prove direct quotations from the Rāmā yana in the other epic. In the Rāmāyana, the verse &lsquo;răjāpam prathamam vindet&rsquo; does not occurses at all. Hopkins is obliged to say that it agrees closely enough in sense and words with the verse in Ayodhyā 67. 11. The verge from Ayodhyā is not ipsissima verba'. There is another gratuitous assumption made by him. He thinks that Bhargava is Vālmiki. Bhargava</p>
<p>means Usanas. Vide Amarakosass quoted below. Hopkins, in spite of his learning and industry, here forgets that the Sāntiparva ( 210. 20 ) ascribes # Nitisāstra to Bhargava and among the expounders of Rājaśästra385 the Santiparva mentions</p>

<p>Kāvya (i.e. Ušanas ) and Bhargava 306 as identical. Vālmīki&rsquo;s name has nowhere been mentioned as that of an expounder of Rājaśāstra. The Rāmāyana itself regards Usanas ( Sukra ) and Bhargava as identical when it describes the auspicious appearances on Rāma&rsquo;s invasion of Rävana&rsquo;s capital ( Yuddha 4.49 ). Vide above under Kautilya&rsquo;s Arthaśāstra where pa88a ges from the Mahābhārata on the Rājaśāstra of Uganas have been quoted. Hopkins misunderstands the verse. What it means is: the life of Rāma was recited to some king by a court poet or possibly by Bhargava Uśanas himself the expounder of Rajasõstra, who thereon recited the famous verse &lsquo;rājānam prathamam vindet &amp;c,&rsquo; because the underlying idea of that expounder was &lsquo;no king, no dharma nor security&rsquo;. It is quite possible that both (i, e. Mahābhārata and Rāmāyana ) quote from a common source viz, the Rājaśāstra of Kavya Uśanas which once existed but has not yet been recovered.</p>
<p>The third passage occurs in the Vana parva, where Bhima is said to have met Hanumat on the Gandhamādana but did not recognize him and took him to be a mere ordinary monkey (chapters 146 ff). There he speaks of Hanumat as his brother and very famous 397 in the Rāmāyana (147. 11). Vālmīki&rsquo;s name is not mentioned in those chapters and this story was proba bly interpolated later. The Vanaparva is in extent next to the Santiparva. These two and the Anusasana parva cover about two-fifths of the whole of the extant Mahabharata. The 4th passage ( quoted in the note below )308 on which Hopkins relies occurs in the last chapter of the Harivamsa (which is a khila) and not at all in the text of the Mahā. bhārata in the Chitrashala edition and others.</p>
<p>The above discussion shows that out of the four passages relied upon by Hopkins one is wrongly interpreted, two are not in the Mabābhārata at all and the remaining one is pro bably interpolated.</p>

<p>The most puzzling question concerning the Mahābhārata is how the members of a polyandrous family became the heroes of the great national epic. Even in the extant epic attempts are made to explain the matter in a supernatural way. In the Asramavāsikaparva it is stated that after the carnage in the great war, Dhịtarăstra, Vidura, Kunti ( the mother of five Pandavas ), Gāndhāri, Draupadi, Subbadrā met together and sages like Vyāsa, Nārada, Parvata and others also came when Dhịtarăstra complained that he had no sleep and no peace of mind and Gándhårī requested Vyāsa to vouch safe to Dhrtarăstra the sight of his fallen sons. Kunti told Vyāsa (Asramavāsikaparva chap. 30 ) how Durvāsas ( an irate sage ) came to her father (a king ) for alms when she was yet a maiden and as she pleased the sage by her assidu ous hospitality, he gave her five mantras on repeating any one of which the god addressed in that mantra would come to her. She proceeded to say that when she saw from her father&rsquo;s palace the rising sun, she called him to come by reciting the appropriate mantra, the sun came and she duly requested him to grant her a son, when the Sun&rsquo;s refulgence entered her and she secretly gave birth to a son (later ) called Karna, whom she let down in a river. She wanted to see that son whom she abandoned. Then Vyāsa consoled her that she was not to be blamed, that deities enter human bodies, that human limi tations do not apply to deities and he recited a verse that everything is pure and wholesome to the strong. 808</p>
<p>In the Adiparva (chap. 169 ) a similar story is repeated almost in the same words that a maiden requested God Sankara five times to bestow on her a husband and so he ble ssed her that she would have five husbands ( pati ) and she became later Draupadi, daughter of king Drupada. Adiparva (197, 35-36 and 44 ff) states the same kind of story, but it is Laksmi (in Svarga ) who asks five times for a husband.</p>
<p>In Adiparva the question how a polyandrous marriage was allowed in the case of the five Pandava heroes has been raised and dealt with in chapter 195, verses 27-31. Drupada (father of Draupadi) urges that five brothers should have one wife is adharma, it is opposed to the Veda and the use</p>

<p>of the people. The reply of Yudhisthira is: &lsquo;Dharma is subtle; we only follow the path of our predecessors. I never told a lie nor am I bent on adharma. But my mother says that we five should have the same woman as wife.400 If one may speculate on the origin of the Pandavas, it is possible that they hailed from the hilly regions in the Himalayas where polyandry prevailed up to recent times, that they were formidable warriors and made their way in the countries of Kuru and Pañcāla and married a Pāñcâla princess. The desceudants of the Pandava heroes viz. Pariksit and Janame jaya are well-known in the Vedic age. The Sat. Br. XIII. 4.5 and Ait. Br. 35. 1 mention Päriksita Janamejaya as a performer of Afvamedha. Dasaratha, Rama and their descendants are not spoken of in these ancient works.</p>
<p>In Anushgana (115. 68-75 ) about fifty ancient kings are named that gave up flesh-eating in Kaumuda (Kårtika) month and therefore they went to heaven. These passages of the great epic would have to be assigned at the most to à century or two before the Christian era.</p>
<p>The Raināyana ( Ayodhyā 109.34 ) contains a down-right condemnnation of Buddha401 as năstika (atheist ) and 88 &amp; thief and in chap. 108 of the same epic Jābāli is introduced as an atheist who condemns in the presence of Rāma tbe finer virtues of respect for parents and other relatives, the institu tion of Srāddha, condemns those who talk of the other world and asks Rāma not to leave the kingdom in favour of Bharata.</p>
<p>The two epics have in common many striking verses. For example, in the story of the Kapota bird and the lubdhaka (hunter) where the Kapota burnt itself in order to offer food to the hungry hunter and the female bird, on the death of the male bird, entered fire and killed herself, a fine verse is put in</p>

<p>the mouth of the female bird in Säntiparva 148. 6–7.403 In the Ayodhyākānda 39. 30-31 Sitä repeats the same verse be fore Kausalyā when she prepares to go into exile with Rāma. Another famous verse of the propriety of punishing even a guru when he becomes conceited, fails to distinguish between what ought to be done or not to be done and who pursues the wrong path 403 occurs in both. The Säntiparva (in 57.6 ) says that in former times king Marutta recited an ancient bloka in Brhaspati&rsquo;s treatise in the section on kings (Rājādhi kāra ) and that it is 57.7. Another verse that occurs in both epics is : all collections end in dissolution, all tall things end in falling down, unions end in separation, life ends in death.404</p>
<p>The discussions so far beld make this clear that the main characters of the Mahabharata were known long before Panini and that tales relating to Pāņdava heroes had been embodied in a work or in works in verse long before Patañjali wrote i. e. that the core of the Mahabhārata existed before 500 B. C. The same cannot be said about the Rāmāyana. There is no evidence to show that the principal characters of the Rāmå yana were known to Pāṇini or even to Patañjali. At the most one can say that the three names, Dasaratha, Rāma and Sitä, were probably known about 250-200 B. C. but not described</p>

<p>as endowed with the qualities they bear in the extant Rāmā. yana. Therefore, one may conclude that there was a Bhärata epic long before there was a Rāma epic. From the way in which the Vānaras led by Angada ( Kişkindhā 41. 6ff) among whom were included such doughty fighters as Hanûmat, Nila, Jámbavat, were directed to go from Kişkindhā towards the south in search of Sitā carried away to Lankā by Rāvana, one feels that the author did not correctly know the different countries that the Vānaras would have had to traverse before reaching Lanka. Sugrīva is said to have told them to go from Kiskindha to the south and one is surprised to read that Sugriva first mentions the Vindhya mountain with its thousand peaks and immediately afterwards Narmadā (chap. 41.8 ) and then mentions Godávarī, Kronavenī, Varadā ( 41.9), Mekala, Utkala, Dasārna towns, Avanti ( 41.10 ), Vidarbha, Vanga, Kalinga ( 41.11 ). It is unnecessary to cite more. The present writer is constrained to hold that whoever wrote that chapter was an inhabitant of a place north of the Narmadā (which springs from Mekala )405 and knew only the names of towns, rivers and countries without knowing their exact loca tion. The author had probably never been to the island of Ceylon nor kuew anything about the distance between India and Ceylon nor haid he any idea about the extent of Ceylon. It was all a poetic fancy without any solid basis of known facts, even ancient. Kiskindhā is now shown to be a village on the Tungabhadrā river in the Bellary District. We know from the Aranyakānda ( chap. 13 ) that Agastya directed Rāma to have a hut in Pañcavați near Godāvari and from that place be later went to Royamūka near Pampā where dwelt Sugriva with four others ( Aranya. 72.11-12 ). 406</p>

<p>It has been shown above that the Rāma story and chara cters are mentioned in the extant Mahābhārata and the legends and some well-known characters in the Mahābhārata are noted in the extant Ramayana. Therefore, all that one can say is that both works have influenced each other. But As the core of the Mahābhārata is much older than that of the Rāmāyana and as the Mahābhārata is four times as bulky as the Rāmāyana, it is the latter that most probably borrowed several matters from the great Epic. It has been demonstre ted above that the so-called four direct references in the Mabābhārata to the Rāmāyana put forward by Hopkins are not so and that only one remains, which appears to me to be a later interpolation.</p>
<p>Just as the story of Nala-Damayanti was set out in the Mahābhārata from a tale current in early days, so the Rāma story might have been only a popular tale in the beginning and was later turned into an epic, but the Mahābhārata, if it had directly borrowed from the Rāmāyana, would not have differed from the epic on such an important matter as the killer of Kumbhakarna. Therefore, it is very probable that the Rāma tale was included in the Vanaparva at a time when the Rāmāyana in its present form did not exist. The present writer holds that the Mahābhārata assumed its present form certainly before the Christian era, but how much earlier it is difficult to say.</p>

<p>Hopking497 devotes pp. 386-403 of his work The Great Epic of India' to the date of the Epic and summarises his con clusions on pp. 397-398. On p. 398 he says there is no date of the Epic' which will cover all its parts (though handbook makers may safely assign it in general to the 2nd century B. C.). A sizable volume would be required to criticize his remarks on several matters and to expose the hollowness of his hasty and one-sided conclusions. To take only one exa mple at random. He relies (p. 387) on the occurrence of the word Dināra in the Harivamsa which is only a supplement to the Mahābhārata and on the fact that in the present text of the Epic ( Adiparva chap. 2.82-83 ) reference is made to the Harivaṁsa as a Khila, in which are included the deeds of Visnu such as killing Kamsa and the Bhavisya parva, wbich is a large and wonderful one amony Khilas. 408 The Dināra is not mentioned in the 18 parvans of the Mahābhārata (not even in Santiparva nor in Anušāsa naparva ) as Hopkins admits on p. 387. Supposing for a moment that the mention of dināra in Harivaṁsa is not interpolated, still from the reference to Harivassa in Adi I. 2 in general it does not necessarily follow that the writer of Adi. 2 had before him a Harivamsa contai ning the word Dināra. Besides, his dating about the Intro duction of Dināras in India is not supported by satisfactory evidence. He states ( on p. 387 ) &quot; for the Roman denarius is known to the Harivamsa and the Harivamsa is known to the first part of the first book and the last book; hence such parts of this book as recognize the Harivarsa must be later than</p>

<p>Vyāba or the Mahābhārata has been mentioned in some early inscriptions.</p>
<p>For example, the Pardi plates of Dahra-sena of Samvat 207 (probably of the Kalacuri or Chedi era i. e. of 456 A. D.) ascribes the verse &lsquo;şaşțim varsa sahasrāại&rsquo; &amp;c. (in E. I. Vol. X. p. 53 ) to Vyāsa. Gupta Ing. No. 31 at p. 137 (the Khoh copper-plate of Mahārāja Sarvanātha dated in 204 of the Gupta era i.e. 533 A. D. ) says &lsquo;uktam ca Mahābhārate Vyāsena&rsquo;.410 This inscription establishes that long before 530 A. D. the Great Epic was deemed to have one hundred thousand verses composed by Vyāsa. It has been already shown how in Bana&rsquo;s day the Epic was recited to an audience of men and women. Several hundred verses are commou to both the Manuşmộti and the Mahābhārata. Commentators of Dharmaśāstra works from early times quote the Mabā bhārata. Medhātithi on Manu II. 94 quotes one of Yayāti&rsquo;s verses about Kāma (desire ) being insatiable. On Manu</p>

<p>When ancient Indians came to Java they brought with them their sacred books. The Mahābhārata soon became most popular among the Javanese.

<p>paper on &lsquo;Manipravāla in Java&rsquo;in ‘Kunhan Raja Presentation volume pp. 65-69&rsquo; shows how from the 12th century A. D. onwards poems were composed in Java in the local kavi language, employed different Sanskrit metres and took over stories from the Sanskrit kāvyas of Kālidāsa, Bhāravi and the episodes in the Mahābhārata and adopted Sanskrit theories of rhetoric and ala; kāras (figures of speech ). Several European scholars have worked on this subject. Vide for example, Louis Finot&rsquo;s learned paper in I. H. Q. vol. I pp. 599-622 ( on the geography and chronology of Indian civilization in Indo China&rsquo;) in which he gives the names of several Dutch and French scholars ( as his predecessors in the same field ). He remarks India has laid her mark on all the great Eastern countries some of which received a substantial part of their religious and artistic culture from India and others are indebted to her for their very existence as civilized states'. For Srivijaya', vide &lsquo;La Royamme de Srivijaya&rsquo; by G.

<p>The commentary called Bhāratabhāvadīpa of Nilakantha Caturdhara ( son of Govinda ) on the Mahābhārata (printed in the Ch. ed. ) is a learned one. In the opening verses at the beginning of Adiparva he praises one Laksmaņārya, then two ancestors of his viz. Nārāyana and Dhireśa who are again named with reverence in Sabhā l.1 as Hamiranurya (i.e. residing in Hamirapur ).

<p>end of the Säntiparva and of Anušāganao he enumerates 414 the several teachers (eight in all) under whom he learnt Vedānta, Mahābhāsya, Veda with its subsidiary lores, logic, Srauta &amp;c.</p>
<p>He mentions Niruktabhāsya on Vanaparva 291.70 and also Vedabhāsya (i.e. Sāyaṇabhāsya ) on Jarūtha (occurring in Rg. VII. 1.7 and X. 80.3). He appears to have been &amp; Mahārāstra brāhmana. On Udyoga 143.25 he explains &lsquo;eka paksāksicaranāḥ&rsquo;as pārkoli&rsquo; (a bird ) in Mahārāsţrabhāgā; on Adiparva 63.20 he explains &lsquo;pitakaiḥ&rsquo; as &lsquo;petyä iti bhā Bāyām&rsquo; which is Marathi &lsquo;petī&rsquo; or &lsquo;petyā&rsquo;. He refers to the custom of raising a bamboo staff at the end of a year and the beginning of a new one (in Adi. 63. 18-19 ) as seen in Mahā răstra and other places. On Sabhā 21.20 he explains the word &lsquo;Srnga&rsquo; as &lsquo;Manurī&rsquo;, which is' Manorā' in present Marathi; on Sānti 87.35 he explains ·gominaḥ&rsquo;as &lsquo;căranas&rsquo; which is &amp; Marathi word. On Vana' 93.27 he explains * Kathinānăm as Kāthi iti Mahürüstra prasiddhah'. Though a Mahārāstrian he knew Yavanabhāsā as on Sabhā 4,2 he ex plains that&rsquo;Jivantī’ is called ' viriji' in Yavanabhāśā.</p>
<p>As he refers to the Medinikoga and the Kālamadhava he is certainly later than the 14th century A. D. In &lsquo;Indian Culture&rsquo; vol. I pp. 706-710 it is stated that Arjunamisra, a Varendra brābmana who flourished in the latter part of the 13th century is a better commentator than Nilakantha. Vimalabodha wrote a commentary on the Mahabharata called Vimalasloki or Durghatárthaprakāśini, a ms, of which is in possession of the Bhandarkar Oriental Institute ( Poona).

<p>in Silver Jubilee Vol. of the BORI pp. 146 ff. Vide Dr. Raghavan&rsquo;s paper in Kane Festschrift (pp. 351-355 ) for some commentators of the Mahābhārata such as Varada, Yajñanārāyaṇa and Anandapurna (about 1350 A. D. ), parts of whose commentaries are found in mss. collections.</p>
<p>The extant Mahābhārata professes that it is removed from the Mahābhārata war only by two generations or 80. It was narrated by Vaisam pāyana to Janamejaya who was the great-grandson of Arjuna. The topics regarding the beg inning of the Kaliyuga and the astronomical data in the Mahābhārata have been discussed at some length in the 3rd volume of the H. of Dh. pp. 896-923.</p>
<p>The probable date of the Mahābhārata war has been dis cussed by the present author in H. of Dh. Vol. III pp. 895 923 and Vol. V. p. 849. There are three dates put forward from comparatively early times, viz. 3101 B. C. (the tradi tional date );( 2 ) that of the Brhat-samhitā and Rājatarangini (viz. about 653 of Kali age ); (3) that of the Vāyu, Matsya, Brabmanda and Bhagavata purāņas which provide that bet ween the birth of Pariksit ( grandson of Arjuna, the outstand ing fighter among the Pandavas ) and the coronation of Nanda there is a period of 1500 (or 1050 or 1015 years, according to various readings in the mss of those Purānas ). Almost all modern scholars discard the idea that the Mahābhārata was composed a short time after the war. Similarly, the matters in the Sānti and Anusasana parvans containing over twenty thousand verses are stated to have been declared by Bhisma, who was mortally wounded but lay on death-bed till the sun turned northwards. This was a very helpful camouflage to insert into the Epic any matter deemed worthy of being put in. In the Parvasa nigrahaparva ( Adi. 2.325-331 ) it is stated that in the Sāntiparva there are 329 udhyāyas ( chapters ) and 14732 verses and in Adi. 2.331-338 it is stated that in the Anuśāsana parva there are 146 adhyāyas and 8000 verses. In the Chitraslala edition there are 365 chapters in the Santi parya and 168 in the Anusasanaparva. Thus the chapters in the two parvans (in the present text ) exceed the number of chapters stated in Adiparva, chap. 2. It is possible that later redactors arranged the chapters differently for varidus reasons. In the Santiparva the longest adhyāya ( 138 ) 221 verses, then comes chap. 284 with 208 verses. On the</p>
<p>INST</p>
<p>FOUN382</p>
<p>History of Dharmaśāstra</p>
<p>other hand the shortest chap. of Sintiparva is 363 (of six verses only ), chapters 353 and 365 have only nine verses each, while some chapters (such as 129, 136, 304, 352 ) have only eleven verses. A few chapters like 192, 338, 342 have a few verses and also long prose passages. I have calculated the verses in the Santiparva and they come to about 13200 or so in the Chitrashala edition, but if one takes into account the prose passages (and calculates them as versified with 32 letters in each verse ), then there would not be much divergence in the number of slokas. Vide C. V. Vaidya&rsquo;s &lsquo;Mahābhārata: a criticism&rsquo;, Appendix, note one, for the total of chapters and slokas in the 18 parvans and the kbila Harivaṁsa stated in the Parvasangrahaparva and in the Bombay edition. They are respectively 96836 and 95826 blokas. Therefore, the reputed extent of the Mahābhārata even in early inscriptions (the Khoh plate of 533 A. D. ) viz. one hundred thousand is only approximate; vide Dr. Sukhtankar&rsquo;s paper in ABORI, Silver Jubilee Volume, (1943) pp. 549-558 for remarks on the figures mentioned in the Parvasangrahaparva.</p>
<p>The Mahābhārata not only repeats tales but also single verses of its own e.g. Sänti, chap, 231.31 repeats Gită 8.17 (sahasra yuga'), chap. 251.9 is the same as Gītā (11.70, āpūryamānam ), chap. 312.14 ( sarvatah pário) is same as Gītā 13.13; Vana parva 189.27 (yada yadā ca dharmasya ) is the same as Gitā 1V. 7.</p>
<p>In the two epics genealogies of ancient kings occur fre quently and it is impossible to reconcile all of them. A few simple examples may be cited. The Manusmrti (in I. ) claims that Brahmā first ( 1.32 ) created Viraj who created him (Manu) and he (Manu) created (1.35 ) the great sages ( Marici, Atri, Angiras, Pulaha, Pulastya, Kratu, Pracetas Vasistha, Bhrgu and Nārada ) and they created the seven Manus (1.36 ) and the world was created by them. If we turn to the Mahabharata, the Anuśasana (chap. 2.5 ft') tells us that Manu Prajāpati&rsquo;s son was Iksvāku, who had one hundred sons of whom Daśāśva was the 10th. But the Vana parva (iu chap. 201-202 ) speaks of Ikyvāku, his son Sasida ( who ruled in Ayodhyā ), his son Kakusthu, bis son Anenas, whose son was Pșthu-whose son was Visvagaśva, whose son was Adki wlinse son was Yuvanāśva and so on. In the Āsvamedljikapare (chap. 4 ) the genealogy is ( in Kytayugu ) Manu-son Krasan</p>

<p>dhi-son Ksupa-son Ikşvāku (chap. 4.3-14 ). If we now turn to the Rāmāyana, chap. 110 of the Ayodhyākānda furni. shes a long pedigree (in verses 5-34 ) as follows: Brahmă Marici-Kaśyapa-Vivasvat-Manu Vaivasvata Prajāpati-Iks vāku (the first king of Ayodhyā )-Kuksi-Vikukşi-Bana Anaraṇya-Pythu-Trišajku &ndash; Dhundumāra - Yuvadāśva - Mān dhātr-Susandhi-Dhruvasandhi&ndash; Bharata-Asita-Sāgara - A82 mañja - Aṁśumān - Dilipa - Bhagiratha - Kakustha - Raghu Pravệddha. Kalmāsarāda -Sankhana - Sudarsana - Agnivarna Sighraga-Maru-Prasuśruva-Ambarisa-Nahusa-Nābhāga-Aja Daśaratha-Rāma. This pedigree contradicts the one in Manu smrti ( 1.34-35 ) set out a little above, where Marici is one of the ten sons of Manu. Let us now turn to the Raghuvamsa, where ( in 1.11-12 ) it is stated that Vaivasvata Manu was the first king, that among his descendants was king Dilipa, whose son was Raghu whose son was Aja whose son was Dasaratha. It should be noted that in the Ayodhyākānda two kings inter vene between Dilipa and Raghu and between Raghu and Aja ten kings are named. Hence it follows that the Ayodhyā. kānda pedigree is either an inflated one or that Kālidasa had a different pedigree before him at least from Dilipa downwards or that Kūlidasa was not aware of the longer pedigree. From the Raghuvamsa itself it appears that Kūlidāsa knew the story of Sagara as an ancestor of Rama and the story of his Aśvamedha horse being carried to the bottom of the earth and the digging of the earth for finding it and the ocean being filled with the waters of Ganges ( Raghu. XIII. 31 ); he also knew the story of Bhagiratha taking the Ganges from the matted hair of Śiva (Raghu IV.32 ) to the earth and of Kaku stha being a descendant of Iksvāku ( Raglu VI. 71 ). It is not unlikely that a very long pedigree was manufactured for the glory of the family of Rama and Kalidasa was not pre pared to accept it in its entirety. It may be noted that Bāna in the Harsacarita ( 6th ucсhvĀsa p. 38 of my edition ) holds that Raghu was the son of Dilipa.</p>
<p>Both the epics inspired many later writers to compose Sanskrit dramas based on the characters and the various stories contained in them. The Dasarūpaka416 recommend</p>

<p>that intending dramatists should rely upon the Rāmāyana and the Bșhatkatbā for plots. Dr. V. Raghavan recently published a work on &lsquo;Some old lost Rāma plays&rsquo; (Annamalai University, 1961).</p>
<p>It appears from Kautilya&rsquo;s Arthaśāstra that it knew the central story of the Mahābhārata and that of the Rāmāyana. For example, on I. 6. 8 ( Arthaśāstra ) it is stated that Rāvana perished since he did not restore another&rsquo;s wife owing to pride and Duryodhana perished because he on account of pride did not agree to give a portion of the kingdom. In Arthaśāstra VIII. 3. 41-43 reference is made to Jayatsena and Duryodhana winning in gambling because of expertness in it and Nala and Yudhisthira lost in gambling. In the Mahābhārata, however, Nala&rsquo;s opponent is said to have been Puskara ( and not Jayatsena). There is little to show that the Arthasāstra refers to literary works like the Mahābhārata and the Rāmāyana and not to tales current among people in its day.</p>
<p>The Mahābbārata is predominently a Vaimna vite work and contains two of the five jewels of Vuisuavism viz. the Gītā and the one thousand names of Visnu (in Anušāsana parva 149. 14-120).</p>
<p>But it is not at all so thorough going in its dogma as are some medieval South Indian works of the 11th and later centuries A. D. The Anušāsana ( 17. 31–153 ) contains 1008 names of Siva also. In many places the identity of Siva and Višņu is emphasized as in Vanaparva and Santiparva.416 There are grand eulogies of Siva in Dronaparva 80. 39-48 and Sau ptikaparva 17 ( this last by Krsna ). In Anušāsana (16.8) Siva is identified with Bruhman.</p>

<p>The Mausala parva417 ( chap. 7) varrates that, after Krona passed away, Arjuna went alone to Dvārakā in order to bring his wives and the Yādava women to the Pārdava capi tal, that Arjuna was attacked by the Abhiras on his way and the Abhiras forcibly carried away many ladies and some went with them of their own free will. Moreover, in Salya Parva 61. 28 ff,418 where Duryodhana, being mortally wounded by a mace stroke on the thigh by Bhima, severely upbraided Vasudeva for the breaches of the rules such as putting up Sikhandip against Bhisma and Yudhisthira&rsquo;s prevarication about the death of Asvatthāmā. Then Vasudeva referred to Duryodhana&rsquo;s evil deeds ( verses 42-47 ), such as not giving &amp; share to Pandavas in the paternal estate, poisoning Bbima, trying to burn Pandavas together with their mother in</p>
<p>jatugļha', taking by force Draupadi to the Sabbā when she was in her monthly period, assault on the very young Abhi manyu by many of Duryodhana&rsquo;s partisans, and added that he Wag killed for all these misdeeds.

<p>THE RĀMĀYAŅA It is remarkable that an Italian scholar G. Gorrecio, published the text of the Rāmāyana in five volumes ( the first being published in 1843 A. D. with a long Introduction of 143 pages and the Uttarakānda being omitted ) and five more volumes of translations, Prefaces and Indexes, the 10th volume being published in 1858 A. D. The Rāmāyana has been edited in several places e. g. by the Gujarati Press of Bombay in seven volumes ( with three commentaries ) and by the Nirnaya sāgara Press (text in two volumes ) in 1905. A critical edition of the Rāmāyana on the lines of the Poona critical edi tion of the Mahābhārata was undertaken at Baroda and 80 far the first three kāndas have been issued. In the present edition of the H. of Dh. the one volume edition of the text of the Rāmāyana published by Mr. R. Narayanaswami Aiyar and edited by a committee of four scholars in 1933 and based on four palm-leaf mss. and several printed editions has been used.</p>
<p>There are several recensions of the Rāmāyana, three being well-known, viz. the Southern represented by the Guja rati Press edition in seven parts and the Nir. edition in two parts, the Bengali recension (represented by Gorrecio&rsquo;s edi tion ) and North-western recension represented by the edition of the Rāmāyana published by the D. A. V. College, Lahore in 1923 ff. The Southern recension is the most widely spread of the three. Jacobi found differences in these recen sions and classified them and arrived at the following conclusions :- (1) Each recension differs from both or one of the other two in the common verses, the Southern recension</p>

<p>having the more original text; ( 2 ) each recension has a good number of verses, longer pageages and sometimes whole can tos which are not found in one of the other two recensions or in both the other recensions ; (3) the sequence of the verses is often different in two or sometimes in all three recensions. Jacobi found that in the first 30 cantos of Kişkindhā 749 ver ses were common out of a total of 1303 verses in Southern recension and 1228 in East Bengal recension. Prof. C. Bulcke finds that of the 4202, verses of the N. W. version of Sundara kānda, 31 percent are absent from the Bengal version and 28 percent from the Southern Recension and 13 percent exclu sively belong to the N. W. recension (vide Poona Orientalist, vol. 25 at p. 37) and adds that the narrative changes very little and that the additional verses are often due to repeti tion of laments, consolations and fuller descriptions of events already narrated. He advances the plausible theory that all three recensions were reduced to writing independently on the basis of a text which had been transmitted orally for several centuries by professional singers who had committed the poem to memory. Prof. C. Bulcke (of Allahabad Univer sity ) in his careful paper on the ( three Rāmāyaṇa recensions) examines these divergences in the recensions (in J. O. R., Madras vol. 17 pp. 1-32 ) and arrives at the conclusion that, in spite of the divergeuces the subject matter of the Rāmā yana viz. the narrative itself has been changed very little. He examines 152 cases from the seven kändas and shows, (A) how in some cases the subject matter occurring in the Southern recension is absent from one recension or from both of the other recensions ; (B) the subject matter not found in the Southeru recension is in some cases present in one or both of the other recensions; and lastly (C) there are other differen ces among the tbree recensions which cannot be classified under either A or B. He points out places where entire sar. gas or fairly long passages are not present in all the recen sions even if they do not contain any new subject matter.</p>
<p>A few striking illustrations of the divergence in the three recensions may be cited here :</p>
<p>1 In the Bălakānda, the auspicious conjunctions of the planets in certain signs of the Zodiac ( Ráśis ) at the birth of Rāma and his brothers occur in the Southern recension but</p>
<p>888</p>
<p>History of Dharmaśāstra</p>
<p>i</p>
<p>are absent in the other two;420 (2) a long poetic description of the Ganges in Ayodhya ( 50. 13-24 ) is absent in the other two recensio</p>
<p>censions: 13 ) the condemnation of Buddha as nūstiku ( atheist ) and as resembling a thief occurs in Ayodhyā ( chap. 109.34 ) in Southern recension but is absent in Gorrecio&rsquo;s ed. aud the whole chap. is absent in N. W. recension; (4) Two sargas, 62 and 63, of Aranyakāņda (in S. recension ) are absent from both Bengal and N. W. recensions; (5) a group of six sargas (10-15 ) in Yuddha-kānda in S. recension is entirely absent from the Bengali recension and partly from N. W. recension.</p>
<p>Many of the quotations from the Rāmāyana in medieval digests are not found in the current editions of the epic, e.g. the Dānasagara of Ballālasena, king of Bengal (composed in sake 1091 i.e. 1169-70 A.D.) quotes four verses from the Rāmāyana of which only one is found in the Yuddhakanda (18.30), acc. to Mr. Bhabtosh Bhattacharya in his paper on</p>

<p>another list on pp. 55-56, where verses quoted as from Rāmāyana in the same works cannot be identified. In another paper on the Rāmāyana and its influence upon the medieval digests of Eastern India Dr. Bhabatosh Bhattacharya shows that the early medieval works like the Hāralată of Aniruddha and the three Ratnākaras of Candesvara on Krtya, Grhastha and Vivāda, quote the Rāmāyaṇa sparingly, e. g. Aniruddha quotes only five verses and the Ratnakaras quote only four verses and that it is only the later medieval works such as the three out of the four Kaumudis of Govindananda that quote fourteen verses from the Rāmāyana, most of which are found in all recensions of the Ramayana and the Rajadharmakaus tubha of Anantadeva quotes in all 39 verses from the Rāmā. yana but many of these verses do not tally exactly with the three recensions of the Rāmāyana.</p>
<p>It should be noted that the Uttarakānda shows no diffe rence worth mentioning. Therefore, it may be assumed that that kānda is not only the work of later interpolators, but it must have been composed after the original poem was bifur. cated into the Southern recension and Northern recension. The Mahabharata narrates the Rama story in Vanaparva (chap. 273-292 ) in about 750 verses. It may be noticed that some of the incidents mentioned in the Uttarakānda occur in the Raghuvamsa of Kālidāsa. For example, Rama&rsquo;s spy called Bhadra was ordered by Rāma on his return to Ayodhyā after the destruction of Rāvana and his forces to report what was talked in the capital and the kingdom by the citizens and other people about himself ( Rāma ), about Sitā and about his brothers (Uttara. chap. 43. 4-6). Then, Bhadra, after repeating what people said about Rāma&rsquo;s ex ploits, stated that people talked disparagingly about taking back Sitā, whom Rāvana had placed on his lap when carrying her away and had imprisoned in the Asokavanikī and that the subjects remarked that they would have to endure, if similar incidents happened in the case of their wives.431 In the 421 अङ्कमारोप्य तु पुरा रावणेन बलाद्धताम् । लङ्कामपि पुरा नीतामशोकवनिका</p>

<p>Raghuvamsa (14.31 ) also the spy is called Bhadra. It is clear that Kalidasa knew the Uttarakānda. The Raghuvamsa in chapter 15 closely follows the Uttarakānda. A few inci dents may be set out. Raghuo. 15. 81-84 may be compared with Uttarakānda 97. 15–17. Compare also Raghu. 15.87-90 with Uttarao chap. 100, Raghu 15. 89-90 with Uttarao chap. 101-102, Raghu, 15. 92-95 with Uttarao 103-5, Raghu 15. 97-98 with Uttarao 107. Kālidāsa in Raghu (14.70) echoes the very words of the Rāmāyana ( Bālakāņda+38 2. 18 and 40).</p>
<p>It should be noted that at the end of the Yuddhakanda there is a long phaluśruti about the fruits of reading it and there is another at the end of the Uttarakānda also.+23 Besides, the first canto of the Balakānda gives a synopsis of the whole of the Rāmāyaṇa up to Rāma&rsquo;s becoming a king after return ing from his victory over Råvana, in which there is no reference to the subject matter of the Bāla kända or of the Uttarakānda. Then, again, in the 3rd chap. of the Bålakanda there is a summary of events from Rāma&rsquo;s birth up to his abandonment of Sitā. It follows that even at the time of this second table of contents the Uttarakinda had not come up to its present form. Dr. Bulcke is not right when he says (on p. 41 of his paper in Poona Orientalist Vol. XXV) that Laks mana was unmarried as Rāma gays in Aranya-kānda ( 18.3). The learned writer forgets that Rāma was making fun of Sūrpaņakhā who wanted Rima to marry her and therefore he (Rāma who had Sitii with him) jocosely said that Lakomana (unaccompanied by a woman ) was unmarried and that she might approach him. But this was all spoken iu fun, as is made clear by the word &lsquo;parihāsūvicalcşanā&rsquo; applied to Sür panakhã (not clever enough to understand the ridicule and the joke). Balakanda, chap. 73 verses 30-33 specify the names of the wives of Rāma and his brothers and Ayodbyā chap. 118.53 expressly says that Urmilī was married to Lakşmala.</p>

<p>The Rāma story is frequently alluded to in the extant Mahābhārata. The story of the golden deer424 ( Márica ) whose beautiful skin Sitā longed to have ( Araṇyakānda. chap. 43-44 ) is referred to in the Sabhäarva 76.5. The Vana parva (chapters 147.31 to 148.19 ) summarizes the Rāma story and ends with the verse that Rāma ruled the kingdom for eleven thousand years. This verse occurs in the Rāmā yaņa also ( Yuddha 131.106 ). The Dronaparva (chap. 59 ) describes the excellence of Rāmarājya. The Dronaparva (196. 36 ) compares the death of Drona to the death of Vālin. A large volume would have to be written if one were to deal with all questions relating to the two epics. I hold that there is no doubt that there existed a Bhārata Epic before there was a Rāmāyana ( Vide&rsquo;the Great Epic of India' by Hopkins, as he says on p. 61 ). Jacobi&rsquo;s German work on the Rāmāyana has been translated into English by Dr. Ghoshal piecemeal in the Volumes of the Journal of the Oriental Institute, Baroda, in vol. V onwards.</p>
<p>In the Salyaparva (39.9–10 ) reference is made to the cutting of the head of a raksasa by Rāma in Janasthäna. In the Santiparva425 is mentioned the story of the return to life of a brāhmana boy ( who had died prematurely ) when Rāma killed Sambūka, a südra practising peuance. The Sāptiparva speaks of the death of Rāvana at the hands of Rāma who was angered by Rāvana. 426 The Drona parva compares the fight of Ghatotkaca and Alayudha with the fight of Rāma and Ravaya ( 96.27-28 ).</p>

<p>History of Dharmaśāstra</p>
<p>Another question much discussed by some Western scholars is the relation of the Rāmāyaṇa to the Dasarathá jātaka. Reasons of space prevent any detailed discussion. The Dasarathajätaka ( No. 461 in Fausböll&rsquo;s edition, vol. IV) is a travesty of the Rāma story. In it Sitā is a sister of Rāna, Dasaratha is a king of Benares (and not of Ayodhya ) who is said to have had 16000 wives and Sītā ( a sister ) is made queen after Rāma&rsquo;s return from the forest. There is nothing peculiarly Buddhist in it. The Jātakas forma later part of the Pali literature. Rhys Davids in &lsquo;Buddbist India &lsquo;furnishes a chronological table of Buddhist litera ture from Buddha&rsquo;s times to Asoka and divides it into ten groups of which the Játakas and Dhammapadas form the 7th. The Játakas are not earlier than 250 B. C. and may be later by a century or more. It is not unreasonable to suppose that the germs of most of the JĀtaka stories were derived from the folk-lore of India existing in those times. They are meant to glorify Buddha in his suppo sed previous existences and, while using well-known names, try (probably purposely ) to make these names (except that of the Bodhisattva) ridiculous. For example, the Kanha Dipāyana Jātaka No. 444 ( its prose being in two distinct parts ) makes it clear that none of the traits of the most famous sage of the Mahābhārata can be traced in the Jātaka called after him. The Jātakas generally contain some Gäthās and some prose passages. In a number of Jātakas the prose parts are in conflict with the găthās or have nothing to do with them. The prose parts in their present form belong to 5th cent. A. D. and arose in Ceylon. Jacobi (Das Rāmå yana pp. 84 ff) and Keith (JRAS. 1915 p. 323 ) hold that the prose parts of Jātakas are confused and belong to a later date. Two questions arise viz. (1) Does the Dasarathe jātaka present an older form of the Räma story? (2) Is the Dasaratha Jātaka really older than the Rāmāyana ? Accor ding to the present author the replies to these two questions are in the negative and he agrees with the conclusions of the late Mr. N. B. Utgikar (in JRAS. Centenary Supplement pp. 203-211 ). Vide also the same scholar&rsquo;s paper in LABRAS ( New Series vol. 4 pp. 115–134 ). In most of the Patuks also the stories as told in the Epic differ greatly from the stories labelled under the same name in them.</p>

<p>In the Dasarathajătaka ( No. 461, p. 127 ) occurs a gātha (&lsquo;phalānam iva pakkānam niccaṁ papatanā bhayam I evam játānām maccānam niccam maranato bhayamil&rsquo;), which occurs in Gorrecio&rsquo;s edition (vol. II p. 42, verse 4) and is quoted below*** (but does not occur in other editions ).</p>
<p>Just as in the extant Mahābhārata references are some times made to the Rāma story, so in the extant Rāmāyana occur references to the legends that occur in the Mahābhārata. For example, the story of Savitri (daughter of Asva pati, king of the Madras, and wife of Satyavan, son of Dyumat sena, the blind king of Sälva ) well-known to all Indian women as the paragon of wifely virtue, is described in Vana parva (chap. 293-299), is very briefly mentioned in the Ayodhyakanda, where+18 Rama first expressed his unwilling Dess to allow Sitā to accompany him in his forest exile. It should be noted that the verse speaks of Savitri&rsquo;s story as well-known and does not dilate on any of the incidents connected with that story. It is again referred to in Sun darakānda 24.11. In the Sundarakānda (chap. 24 10-12 ) six pativratus are named among whom Damayanti is the last.458 The story of Nala, king of Nişadha, and his devoted wife Damayanti is one of the longest ākhyānas in the Mahābha rata and is a very charming one. It is set out in the Vana parva, chapters 52-79. Cyavana was a son of Bhrgu. Vana parva (chap. 122-124 ) narrates at some length how Suka nyā, daughter of king Saryāti, had to marry the sage blinded by her through mistake. She stuck to the old and blinded Cyavana, although the Asvins sought her hand. It should be noticed that most of these stories occur in the Mahābhārata</p>

<p>and some (like those of Sāvitrī, Damayanti and Sukanya ) at great length, while the Rāmāyaṇa employs them only for com parison and does not set them out at length. Sagara is referred to in the Rāmāyana (Ayodhyā 36.16 about Asamañja). But no reference is made to his wives. In Vana parva (chap. 106-7) it is stated that Sagara was a descendant of Iksvāku, had two wives, Vaidarbhi and Saibyā, had from Saibyā one son called Asamañja whom he banished because he indulged in the pastime of drowning the children of the subjects (Santi, chap. 57.8-9 ) and Sagara had sixty thousand sons from Vaidarbhi who were all reduced to ashes by Kapila&rsquo;s wrath when they dug the earth, found Aśvamedha horse near sage Kapila and wanted to apprehend Kapila as the thief. The story of Uttarka, a devoted pupil of Gautama, is narrated at length in Advamedhika parva chap. 55-58 and in Vanaparva chap. 132–33. He married the daughter of Gau tama and requested Ahalyā, Gautama&rsquo;s wife, to accept some present as Gurudaksiņā (fee). When Uttanka pressed her to accept something, she asked him to bring the jewelled ear rings of the wife of king Saudása- man-eater ( 56.31 ). He went to Saudāga and begged for the ear-rings of his wife Madayanti. Saudāsa asked him to see his wife and give her his message. A long story is narrated about the ear-rings which she gave. King Janaka held assemblies of learned men for discussion. One bandin (i. e. sūta at his court ) used to argue with learned men, defeated them and plunged them in water. Uddalaka had a pupil Kahoda, who married the daughter of his guru. She conceived and the child in the womb rebuked his father when he committed mistakes in re peating Veda. The father cursed the foetus that he would be defective in eight limbs. Astāvakra defeated bandin and those who had been thrown into water (including Kahoda who had been defeated by Bandin ) were revived by Varuna and then Kahoda recited a verse set out in the note below.480 Yayāti is frequently mentioned for comparison or illustration as in Ayodhyā 5. 10 ( same words in Kişkindhā 17. 9, viz. &lsquo;yayātim-iva punyānte devalokād-iba cyutam&rsquo;, also Araṇyeo</p>

<p>The Sundarkānda is regarded by scholars as part of the original epic. Therefore, it is probable that the part of Sun darkāņda which mentions the names of six pativratas, the stories about whom occur at length in the Vanaparva and Ašvamedhika-parva, is probably later than the parvan: (Vana and Asvamedhika ) which are held by several scholars to be later than earlier parvans of the great Epic.</p>
<p>Nalakūbara is said to have cursed Rāvana when the latter ravished apsaras Rambhā (Vanaparva 280.59-60, Uttara kānda 26. 15 and 41 ff&rsquo;) who had an assignment with Nalakūbara, son of Vaisravana, brother of Rāvana; on hearing about this he cursed Rāvana that his head would be shattered in seven pieces if he dared to ravish any woman. In the Yuddbakānda ( 122. 16 ) it is stated that Dasaratha ( who had died and had gone to heaven ) came in a heavenly car to meet Rāma after his victory over Rāvana and said . You have saved me as the brāhmaṇa Kabola was saved by Astāvakra.&rsquo; The story of Astávakra, son of Kahoda is narrated in Vana parva chap. 132-4. King Nrga while making gifts of cows to brāhmaṇas, by mistake donated the cow belonging to a brāh mana which had strayed among the cows belonging to the king and when the brāhmana lodged a complaint against the recipient of his cow before the king, the latter did not look into the matter for many days and the two brāhmanas cursed him to be a chameleon. That story is referred to in Apusā. sana 6. 38, Asvamedhika 90. 99-100 and Anusāsana 70 (at length ) and 72. 2.</p>
<p>Taking the cue from the name Sitā (the heroine of the Rāmāyaṇa ) several scholars have regarded the Rāmāyaṇa as an allegory, the word Sitā being employed twice in the Rgveda (IV. 57.6 and 7) and apostrophized as a goddess.481 Three personages are known to our mythology as Rāma, viz. Jāme dagaya Rāma ( or Parasurama ), Balarāma ( brother of Krsna )</p>

<p>and Dāśarathi Rama. It is unnecessary for the history of Dharmasastra to deal with this question when the Rāmāyaṇa is admitted by all scholars as separated from the Rgveda by at least a thousand years or more.</p>
<p>It has been stated above that the core of the Rāmāyana story may be only as old as 300-250 B. C. at the most. Asva ghosa432 in his Buddhacarita refers to Vālmīki as writing a poetical work when Cyavana ( his ancestor ) did not do 80. Besides, the Raghuvamsa closely follows the Uttarakānda as shown above. If we accept the date of Kālidāga as between 350 to 450 A. D., then the Ramayana in its present form can not be placed later than about 200 A. D. and may be placed at least a century or two earlier. In the Kiskiudhā-kānda two verses have been expressly quoted as recited by Manu which occur in the present Manu.433 In Ayodhya 107.11-13 two verses are stated to have been uttered by Gaya in Gaya with reference to pitrs.434</p>
<p>The Rāmāyana being mainly a Kávya is not frequently or profusely quoted by works on Dharmaśāstra, particularly by comparatively earlier ones. Among the early commentators, Medhātithi on Manu IV. 217 refers to the Rāmāyana as pre scribing Srāddha on the 4th, 8th, 9th and 10th days after the death of a person. On Manu V. 7 Medhātithi quotes without naming the Rāmāyana a half verse from it (yadannaḥ puruso</p>

<p>rājan-tadannāstasya devatāḥ ).436 It may be noted that the Dhvanyaloka ( a Kashmirian work on Poetics of the latter half of the 9th century A. D. ) quotes a verse from the Aranya-kanda ( 16. 18 ) as an example where the Vyaigya ( suggested ) sense pushes the literal sense ( vācya ) of the word ( undhu in that verse ) very much in the background (atyanta-tiraskxta-vacya ).438_ In spite of this writers on Sanskrit Poetics rarely quote or refer to it.</p>
<p>Even Aparărka who quotes the Mahābhārata dozens of times quotes the Raināyana only twice. 437 On Yāj. I. 211 Aparārka quotes &amp; verse saying of one who being able to save a sarunāgatu allows him to die in his presence all merit ( sukrta i.e. punya ) is taken away by the one who is not saved ). On offering water to one&rsquo;s deceased relations Aparārka ( on Yaj. III. 5) quotes a verse from Ayodhyakanda (102-27 ). The Smrticandrika ( I. p. 57 ) quotes Sundara kanda 59, 35-36 about cessation of study on the first tithi of a month (pratipat-phthasilasya vidyevu tanutam gata). The Krtyakalpataru ( on vrata, brahmacāri, tīrtha and naiyata kāla has no verses froin Rämūyana though Naiyata kālikā quotes about two dozen verses from the Mahābhārata). Both epics condemn the king who being engrossed in pleasures does not attend the court of justice when the parties approach him for justice. The Kalpataru on &lsquo;grhastha.&rsquo; quotes only two verses from Ramayana, but it mentions the Mahābhārata</p>

<p>' Pictorial History of civilization in Java ;' History of Srivijaya' by Prof. K. A. Nilakanta Sastri (1949 ); &lsquo;Hindu Law in Java and Bali&rsquo; by Dr. R. C. Majumdar in S. K. Aiyangar Memorial Volume pp. 445-461.</p>
<p>The Mahābhārata became very popular in Java; the Javanese puppet shows called &lsquo;wayang&rsquo; have preserved the old Hindu traditions even in these days, though Java has been * Moslem country for five centuries. Tantric doctrines also prevailed in Java and Sumatra. The Rāmāyana exists in Bali in the Kavi language. There exist several recensions of the Rāmāyaṇa in Java, both in verse and probe.</p>
<p>Some incidents of the Rama story are represented in the Javanese · Wayang' (shadow plays ). Dr. Bijan Raj Chatterjee in India and Java' p. 29 states “ In a 6th century inscription of Cambodia we find the following passage with the Rāmā yana and the Purana he (the Brahman Somaśarman ) gave the complete Mahabharata and arranged for a daily recitation without interruption'. About India&rsquo;s influence on architecture in Indonesia Levi writes “In Architecture it is in distant Cambodia and distant Java that we have to look for the two wonders produced by the Indian genius, Angkor and Boro Budur'( q. from Srivijaya &lsquo;by Prof. Nilakanta Sastri p. 11 ).</p>
<p>Two interesting chapters in the two epics are known as Kaccit-praśna&rsquo; chapters. They are Sabhā-parva chap. 5 verses 17-110 and 114-125 (in all 106 verses ) where the sage Nārada asks Yudhisthira certain questions about what an ideal king is expected to do in all that concerns the Govern ment of the State and the people, and Ayodhyākānda chap.100 verses 76 ( of which the first five are introductory in which Rāma, who was staying on Citrakūta along with Sitã and Lakşmala ), inquires of Bharata about the Government of Ayodhyá after Rāma left.441 In verses 6-10 Rāma asks Bharata about Dasaratha, about the Upādhyāya ( Vasistha ) of the family and about his mother and step-mother; so in the Rāmāyana only 66 verses are properly concerned with the Government of the country, the king&rsquo;s duties and actions and cognate matters, while in the Mahābhārata these matters are</p>

<p>The word &lsquo;Kaccit&rsquo; is employed when the person asking the question desires to receive a favourable reply, as the Amarakośa says &lsquo;Kaccit kāmapravedane&rsquo;. The Rāmāyana, employs this word in other passages also as in Balakānda 52. 7-9.

Another weighty criticism is that at the time when this kaccit chapter is supposed to have been addressed by him to Bharata, Rāma did not know that king Dasaratha was dead. It is after this chapter that Bharata tells Rāma (in chap. 101. 5-6 ) that after Rima left for the forest the king died, being overwhelmed by sorrow. Therefore, some of the questions put in the mouth of Rāma are inappropriate and irrelevant, such as the questions about the honour paid to Upādhyāya, about Purohita, Mantrins, Senāpati and duta. All these high functionaries had been appointed by Dasaratha himself. On the other hand, in the case of Yudhisthira, who was the eldest among the sons of Pandu and who performed the Rājasūya also ( also as described in Sabhā 33 ff ), those questions were appropriate. I think the chapter ( 100 ) of the Ayodhyākānda is based on chap. 5 of the Sabhāparva and about 29 verses were almost bodily taken from the sheet parva into the Ayodhyākānda.</p>

<p>popular and is relied upon as a source in digests on Dharma, though not so frequently and profusely as the Mahābhārata. Vide for example, Dr. Bhabatosh Bhattīcārya&rsquo;s paper on * Rāmāyana and its influence on medieval digests of East India' in Gode com. volume pp. 19-26. The following table will give some idea of the different topics of Dharmaśāstra dwelt upon by the Ramayana. The references are to the Madras one volume edition referred to above (p. 399 n. 441 ).</p>
<p>Abhiseka-Ayodhyā 15, Yuddha 131. Arājaka-Ayodhyā 67. Pātakas (sins )- Kiskindhā 17-18. Rājadharma-Balakanda 7, Ayodhyā 100, Aranya 6, 9, 33,</p>
<p>40-41, Yuddha 17, 18, 63. Srāddha-Ayodhyă 76, 103. Satyaprašamsă-Ayodhyī 109. Strīdharma-Ayodhyā 24-27, 29, 39, 117-118.</p>
<p>It must be stated that whole cantos are unauthorizedly added in some cases in the Rāmāyana e.g. in the Uttarakānda after chap. 23 five surgas ( containing 296 verses ) are added. Five more are added after chap. 37 ( containing 244 verses ) and three cantos are added after chap. 59 ( containing 145 verses ).</p>
<p>Another matter to be noted is that not only are unautho rized verses added in the Rāmīyana but here and there verses are repeated e.g. several verses in Ayodhyā 105. 4-12 and Yuddha 131. 2-10. It has been already shown that about 29 verses ( with &lsquo;kaccit&rsquo; in them ) have been borrowed from the Mahābhārata. Moreover, several verses are common to both the epics (e. g. vide pp. 385-386 above).</p>
<p>The claim, put forward in the Balakanda (chap. 2, verses 3-31 ), that Valmiki, on seeing the Krauńca bird killed by a hunter, uttered a verse ( śloka ) that was to be the pattern or model for all succeeding poets composing poems in that matters cannot be admitted as tenable. The Rāmāyana as a K cannot be claimed on the available evidence as earlier things 300-200 B. C.</p>
<ol start="32">
<li>The Two Epics</li>
</ol>
<p>403</p>
<p>Quotations in the Mahābhâsya lead to the conclusion that, centuries before Patañjali, works in the Sloka metre bad been composed. A few examples quoted below will bear out this.442</p>
<p>Verses in the Sundarakāndia*4.3 are of great significance on the date of the Ramiyana. Hanūmin is said to have pondered over the question whether he should address Sita in Sanskrit used by Dvijātis ( brālimanas, ksatriyas and vaisyas ) or he should employ sentences used by common men ( vide note below). There is hardly anything to show that about 400 or 500 B. C. there was a vast difference between the languages spoken by higher classes and those spoken by lower classes. But a century or two before and after the Christian era great differences had arisen between the two as indicated by Inscrip tions aud literary works.</p>

<p>History of Dharınaśāstra</p>
<p>on the Rāmāyana' by ths late Right Honourable V. S Srinivasa Sastri ( publisheil by the Madras Sanskrit Academy in 1949). He does not real with the Rāmāyaṇa in the spirit of a critical scholar. Questions of the date of the Rāmāyana, the authorship of it, of the indebtedness of Vālmiki to others and of the authenticity of the present text are left out by him. He deals at great length with the principal characters of the epic and his language is moving, often charged with fervour and emotion and his exposition of the different incidents is masterly. He quotes a very large number of verses from the Rāmāyana. In his exposition he is at his best when he deals with the attack by Rāma against Välin from behind trees and the incident of harsh words Rāma used when he abandoned Sitā after killing Rāvana ( Yuddhakānda, 118, verses 12-24) His words are most eloquent when in the 27th lecture on p. 432 he says &lsquo;that is Rāma&rsquo;s greatness that he did not mind sacrificing anything to preserve Dharma. Dharma has many pbases. What he ( Rāma ) thought was his highest Dbarma, that he fulfilled and to that end there was nothing that be would not sacrifice&rsquo;. It may be pointed out that the Padma purāņa (Anandaśram ed. IV. 66. 28-29 ,444 proclaims in two verses the virtues that the Rāmiyana emphasizes by delineat ing some paragons of virtue such as Rāma, Sitā, Bharata, Laksmana and Hanūmān.</p>
<p>Though the Rāmāyana is full of poetic passages, it often departs from Panini&rsquo;s grammar. A few examples may be cited; * Kurmi’ ( for karomi ) in Ayodhya 12. 36, &lsquo;ānayitum&rsquo; (for &lsquo;ānetum&rsquo;) in Ayodhyā 19. 10 and &lsquo;nayisyati ( for ' nesyati&rsquo;) in Ayodhyā 12. 87, &lsquo;rusya&rsquo; Ayodhya 97. 12, Mantrimsca' in Sundarakānda 51. 37 ( for Mantriņasca ).</p>
<p>The Gujarati Press edition of the Rāmāyana ( in seven parts, 1912-20 ) contains three commentaries. A brief statement on these may be made here. Of the three the earliest seems to be the one called Bhūsana composed by Govindarájan of Kausikagotra. He was a man of profound learning in the various branches of Sanskrit literature. Sometimes his commentary is very extensive ( as on the first verse of the Balakanda ), but sometimes it is the briefest of</p>

<p>the three commentaries ( as on I. 75. 4, 1. 76. 15 ). At the end of the Bălakānda he states that he had acquired fame by his proficiency in the Vedas, Săstras and learned discussions and he had a keen intellect in Sanskrit poems, Alwinkāra ( Poetics ) and the dramatic art. This writer confers different names on his own commentaries on the different kändas viz. Manimanjira, Pitambara, Ratnamekhalā, Muktāhāra, Srngära tilaka, Ratnakiriţa, Manimukuta. It appears that Satakopa of Vatsa-gotra was his guru and he was the son of Varada ( last verse in com. on Yuddhakanda ). At the end of his commentary on Sundarakanda, he states that he looked into several commentaries of former ācāryas.</p>
<p>As he quotes the KĀvyaprakāśa, the Alankārasarvasva and the Vștta-ratnākura he is certainly later than the 12th century A.D. and most probably flourished in the last quarter of the 15th century. Vide an exhaustive paper on Govinda rāja by the late Prof. K. V. Rangaswami Aiyangar in A.B.O.R.I. [ Silver Jubilee vol. (1943), pp. 30-54 ).</p>
<p>The 2nd commentary is called &ldquo;Rāmāyanusiromani'. The author&rsquo;s name is not clearly stated in the beginning, though at the end of the 7th kānda the concluding verse clearly says &lsquo;Sivasalāya-nirinitiresā&rsquo;. So this commentary was written by Siva-sahāya and he composed the commentary on the banks of the Triveni (Ganges at Allahabad ) with the help of a rich patron called Vamsidhura, sou of Sitārāma, son of Todirama. This commentary also is learned and very extensive on some verses. From the last verse ( 8 ) it appears that the commentary was completed in Sarvat 1921, Asvina sukla 10 (i, e. 1864 A. D.). Thus it is a very modern commentary.</p>

<p>written by Sri Nāgeśa under the patronage of Rāmavarman, The idea of those two verses appears to be that the import of the Rāmāyana was made clearer by the clearing cloth in the form of the intellect of Rāmavarman. What part other than that of a patron ( who employed an eminent scholar like Nāgeśabhatta ) Rāmavarman played is not quite clear. The opening verses of the commentary on the Bălakānda mention only Rāma as the author.</p>
<p>The commentary is learned and to the point and does not make an exhibition of the author&rsquo;s wide reading and scholar ship.</p>
<p>As would be shown later on Nāgeśa (or Nāgojibhatta ) flourished between 1670-1750 A. D.</p>

He mentions the commentators on the Ramayana mostly from South India, as the Vaisnavas in South India looked upon the Rāmāyana as the most sacred work on Visnu wor ship.</p>
<p>In the Mahābhārata-titparya-nirnaya of Anandatirtha (Sri Madhvācārya, 13th century A. D.), seven chapters (III-IX) are devoted to the Ramayana story. In the first chapter he sets out the authorities. In I. 30447 he refers to the four Vedas vin. Rgveda and others, the Pancurătra system, the Bharata, the Mula-Rāmāyana, and the Brahmasūtra these are regarded as self-sufficient authorities. What does be mean by Mūla-Rāmāyana ? It means nothing else than the Rāmāyaṇa of Vālmīki. In Sanskrit and the popular langua</p>

IX (verses 125-7)448 the great Acārya says &lsquo;through the grace of Visnu he has declared this grand story, by reasoning and by the power of his intellect, after dispelling all contradictions and deciding the truth from all the Purānas, the works on Pancarātra, from the Bhārata, the Vedas and the great Rāmāyana. So here the word Mahārāmāyana is used in the same sense as Mula-Rāmāyana, since in both places ( 1-30 ) and (IX. 125 127 ) it is the sources of the Rāma saya that are spoken of</p>
<p>Mr. S. N. Tadpatrikar (in ABORI vol. V. pp. 61-68 ) refers to the word ' Mülarāmāyana ' and starts a new theory that the Mülarāmāyana mentioned in I. 30 by Madh vācārya is different from the Mahārāmāyaṇa mentioned by the Acārya himself in IX. 125. The only authority for this is his inter pretation of some words he quotes from the commentary Tilaka. The few words he quotes are not at all clear and do not support what Mr. Tadpatrikar mentions and further the commentator is no authority binding on modern scholars for the meaning of the words employed by the Acārya in the 13th century.</p>
<p>The Rāmāyaṇa, being a Kávya and an Akhyāna ( as stated in Dānasāgara, Introductory verse, 15, p. 3), it is sparingly quoted in Dharmaśāstra works. Dr. Bhabatosh Bhattacharya in his paper on The Rūmayana and its influence on Ballūlasena and Raghunavdana &lsquo;449 published in J. O. I. ( Baroda ), vol II, pp. 18-22 points out that only one out of</p>

<p>the four verses quoted from the Rāmāyana in the Dānasāgara could be traced in the Yuddhakānda (chap. 18.30 · vinastaḥ &hellip; raksitaḥ &lsquo;) in the Gujarati Press edition and that none of the four verses could be found in the Bengali editions. In another paper on the Rāmāyana and its infiuence on the medieval digests of Eastern India&rsquo; in P. K. Gode Commemora tion Volume 1960, pp. 319-326, the same learned writer discus ses the quotations from the Rāmāyana in the Hāralatā, the three Ratnākaras of Candeśvara (on Krtya, Grhastha, and Vivāda), Kaumudis of Govindānanda ( on Dāna, Srāddha ), and the Rājadharma-kaustubha of Anantadeva. The Kalpa taru on Moksa (pp. 25-26 ) quotes some verses from the Rām. Aranyakānda (chap. 6.2 ff) with different readings. The Mahābhārata offers a great contrast in this respect to the Rāmāyaṇa, as hundreds of verses are quoted from it even in the comparatively early commentaries and digests like the Mitākṣarā and the Kalpataru.</p>
<p>It is impossible to deal with the numerous writings on the Rāmāyana. Jacobi&rsquo;s German work on the Rāmāyana has been translated into English by Dr. S. N. Ghoshal and published by driblets in several volumes of the Journal of Oriental Institute ( Baroda ). Numerous dates have been proposed for the Rāmāyana e. g. the Department of Letters, Vol. 19 ( Calcutta University ) puts down 433 A. D. as its date. The Rāma story occurs frequently in the Mahābhārata e. g. vide Sabhāparva 50. 39, Vanaparva chap. 148-152 (31 verses ), chap. 274-293 ( verses about 769 ); several Purāṇas such as Brahmao, chap. 123 and 154, Padmapurāna ( several times in Pătălakhanda and Uttarakhanda ), Nārada purāna, Bhāgavatapurāna (IX. 10-11 about 82 verses ), Agni purāna (chap. 5-12, verses 189 ). One writer in Preraņā ' monthly for October 1949 says that there are fourteen commentaries on the Rāmāyana.</p>

It would be noticed that the 14 sources are arranged by Yājñavalkya in a rising scale of importance and authoritativene88.460 The word Purāna ( a class of works ) occurs in the Atharvaveda (XI. 7. 24, XV. 6. 10-11). The Sat. Br. (XI. 5.6-8 ) includes</p>
<p>Itihasa puranam&rsquo; among &lsquo;Svädhyāya&rsquo; and furtber states ( XIII. 4. 3. 13 ) that on the 9th day of the Pāriplava ( an item in the Rājasûya sacrifice) the hotr priest narrates some Purāņa. The Tai. Ār. II. 10 mentions Brāhmaṇas, Itihāsas, Purānas, Kalpas etc. ( Brühmannitihăsăn Purānāni Kalpan, Gāthā Nārāśamsih). In the Chandogya Upanisad ( VII. 2 and 4 ) Itihāsa&ndash;Purāna is spoken of as the fifth Veda and the Brbadāranyaka Up. (IV. 1. 2 ) separately mentions Iti hāna and Purána. The Āśv. Gr. includes Purāṇāni under &lsquo;svādhyāya !.461</p>
<p>It is not unlikely that originally there was only a single work called Purana. The Mahābhāsya ( Kielhorn, vol. I p. 9) uses the word Puranam and the Matsya (chap. 53) states that ori. ginally the Purīna was only one. But since the Tai. Ar. emp. loys the word &lsquo;Purīnāni&rsquo; in the plural it appears likely that there were in the times of the Aranyaka at least three (if not more) works called Purana. A verse quoted below-Purānam Mánavo dharmah etc.-&lsquo;462 occurs in many copies of the Manus mrti after XII. 110 and is mentioned by the Tantravārtika on Mimāṁsāsūtra 1.3.27 p. 286 ( Anan. ed., first half).</p>

<p>History of Dharmaśāstra</p>
<p>The Purānas, as a class of works, were looked upon us encyclopaedias for all men and women as to ancient and medi val Hindu religious practices, mythology, geography, his tory of persons, families, royal dynasties and literature.</p>
<p>The chronology of Purānas is, like that of the Epics, . subject full of perplexing problems and is not dealt with in this revised edition of the first volume of the H. of Dh, as it has been discussed at length in the H. of Dh. Vol. V. pp. 815 1002 and the views of Pargiter, Kirfel, Dikshitar and Hazra have been set out, discussed and criticized at length in pp. 831-853. Vide also the present author&rsquo;s paper Paurāņa dharma&rsquo;in Gode commemoration volume pp. 70-82 for the changes in religious ideas and practices brought about by the Purānas or reflected in them.</p>
<p>It has to be mentioned here that in the first few centuries of the Christian era the idea prevailed that those rules or ordinances ( Dharmas ) that were understood from the Veda are the highest (in authority ), but the rules ( Dharmas ) stated in the Purānas ( and similar works ) were inferior.468 This posi tion assigned to the Puranas was changed a few centuries before 1000 A. D. and Purānas came to be far more relied upon by works on Dharmaśāstra. For example, the Krtyakalpa taru (about 1125-1160 A. D.) quotes the Purālas even on such a topic as Mokoa much more than the Upanişads or the Vedāntasūtra. Aparărka quotes a half verse*** as from Menu ( not found in extant Manusmrti), saying that one should strengthen the Veda by Itibāsa ( i. e. Mahābhārata ) and Pura uas. It is significant that the extensive commentary of Vigvarūpa on Yāj. hardly ever mentions a Purāļa by name, though he twice refers to Purānas in a general way on Yaj. III. 170 and 175. He flourished about 800-860 Ą. D. Simi. 453 अतः स परमो धर्मो यो वेदादधिगम्यते । अवरः स तु विज्ञेयो यः पुराणादिषु</p>

<p>larly, Medhătithi on Manu very rarely refers to Purānas and mentions none by name. Vide notes below.486</p>
<p>The main characteristics of the teachings of the extant Purällas, some of which at least were composed in the first few centuries of the Christian era would be merely indicated here briefly. Those who want to go into greater details are requested to refer to Vol. V of the H. of Dh. pp. 928-980. North and Central India had been harassed by the invasions of foreign hordes such as the Sakas and Hūnas. Besides, the performance of Vedic sacrifices had become rare; Buddhism, Jainism and other schisms had greatly affected the minds of all persons including religious and thoughtful men. The leaders of Hindu Society had to wean away common men from the new and attractive teachings of Buddhism and hence the writers of Purāņas struck upon finding out new dogma. The first doctrine that was recommended was that great rewards ( spiritual and other-worldly ) would follow on a little</p>

<p>trouble and effort.466</p>
<p>Dāna (charity and gifts) came to be regarded as conferring the highest rewards in the Mapusmrti ( 1.86 &lsquo;tapah param&hellip; dānamekam kalau yuge&rsquo;), in Santiparva, Vāyupurāņa (6.65 66), Parāśarasmști (1. 23). The gifts of food ( and particu larly to brāhmaṇas ) were regarded as highest. When the invasions by foreigo hordes were frequent and when rulers of different kingdoms in India itself engaged in constant warfare this idea was good enough</p>
<p>Even the Rgveda (X. 117. 6 ) condemns one, wbo offers no food to Aryarnan (and other gods ) nor to a friend (guest etc.) and feeds himself alone, eating only sin. The same idea (almost in the same words ) occurs in Manu III. 18, Visnusmrti 67. 43 (aguam sa kevalam-bhunkte yah pacutyatmakārunāt) and the Bhagavad-gitā (III. 13 ). But the Purūnas carried this idea to extreme limits. Manu prescribed that in rites in honour of gods and pitrs, even a single learned brāhmana may be fed to secure the full reward of the rite, but not many brāhinnnas who do not know the mantri18. Again, in 111. 149 Manu says that in rites for gods no close examination about a brāhmana should be indulged in, but that in rites for ances tors effort should be made to ascertain that the family and character of the brahmanas are both good. But gradually this idea was given up, particularly at Sraddhas in Gayā. For example, the Vāyupurāna states that the brāhmaṇas of Gaya are supermen, that when they are gratitied (at a Sräddba) the gods together with the pitřs become gratified, that no question should be raised about their fainily, their character, learning or tupas and that by honouring them a man attaine liberation.</p>
<p>It may be pointed out that the Vanaparva (chap. 84. 82-104 ) speaks at length about Gaya and its holy places, most of which are quoted in the Padmapurāya, Adik bauda, chap. 38 ( verses 2-19). Those interested may consult H. of Dh. Vol. 1 V for detailed statements about Gaya.</p>
<p>Auother important change in beliefs and practices mirror ed in the Purānas is that of pilgrimages to holy places and baths in holy rivers us destroying the effects of even the most 468 349aa aa at ptecnica e gate faruqaro VI. 2. 24</p>

<p>heinous sing.467 For example, the Anusāsana parva ( 25. 42) says-&rsquo; In Gayà a man is purified even of the sin of three murders of brahmanan, if he visits Asmaprstha (Pretasilā in Gayā ), the hill called Niruvinda and the Kruuñcapadi. We find even the Vannparva stating that one does not secure those rewards even by performing solemn sacrifices in which fees paid to the priests are large, as one secures by pilgrima ges to holy places.</p>
<p>Another development for which Purānas are largely responsible is that of numerous observances called Vratas (described in vol. V part 1 pp. 81-462). It makes one sad to find that a great minister of State in the latter half of 13th century A. D., Heinsidri, deals with nearly 1000 vratas in about 2500 printed pages, instead of pondering over the great menace of invasions against India by foreigners from the 11th century onwards and does not take or even suggest methods or means to counteract that evil.</p>
<p>Another important aspect dealt with by soine Purānas is that of bhakti&rsquo; (devotion to God ) and Ninasmarana (repea ting inaudibly the names of God). The word Bhakti in its technical sense of loving faith in and surrender to God does not occur in the early Upanisaids, but only in the Svetásvata ropanigad VI. 23 (yasya deve parī bhaktir-yathā deve tathā gurau ). It is developed in the Bhagavadgită (as in IX. 27 aud 34, XI. 55 ), and in the Bhagavata, Visųu and other Purā ŅAs. The subject of bhakti has been treated at some length in H. of Db. vol. V pp. 950-980.</p>
<p>Prof. Hazra in ludiau Culture&rsquo; vol. I. pp. 587-614 con tributes a learned paper on · Purānas in the History of Smrti&rsquo; and at the end of the paper sets out several nibandhu works on Dharmaśāstra in which Purana passages are quoted and relied upon.</p>
<p>His treatment of the subject is, however, not exbaustive. To take only one instance. As regards quotations from</p>

<p>Purāuas in the Mit. he cites only one quotation from the Matsyapurana (chap. 94 ). But the Mit. quotes several Purānas on Yāj. For example, on Yāj. III. 30 it quotes a verse from Brahmăuda purāna which is also quoted by the Smrticandrikā. On Yāj. I. 297-98 the Mit. quotes two verses from Matsya purāna ( 93.11-12) on the position of the planets on a diagram or painting of planets in Grahapūjā. Matsya ( 93.33-37) prescribes the same four Vedic mantras that Yaj. prescribes (in I. 300-301 ) for the worship of the Sun, Mars, Saturn and Ketu. The Mit. on Yāj. III. 6 prescribes the offering of Nārā yanabali for those that commit suicide and states that the procedure is described in Vaişnava (purāna ?). On Yāj. III. 6 the Mit. quotes from the Bhavisyat-purána providing, for death on serpent bite, to a brahmana reciter of Purảnas the gift of a golden serpent made from one bhara of gold. The Mit. on Yāj. II. 290 refers to the view of the Skandapurana that there were veryūs that belonged to a distinct caste. It appears to quote the Märkandeya purāna several times on Yaj. 1.238, 254, III. 19, 287. Thus the Mit. mentions by name only six Purānas, while Aparärka naines twenty Purāṇas and Smrti-candrikā 22.</p>
<p>In all about 40 Puranas and Upa purāṇas are quoted in Nibandhas.</p>
<p>Purānas have been published by different individuals, presses and societies. A critical edition of at least the eighteen Purānas based on Mss. collected from all parts of our country had long been a desideratum. But only recently the work of re-editing Purānas in a critical manner by collecting and consulting Msg. from the whole of India has been under taken by the Purana Prakāśana Samiti of the All-India Kashiraj Trust, Benares. The work which is under the general guidance of Dr. V. Raghavan, Dr. V. S. Agrawala and Panditarāja Sri Rajesvara Sastri has been going on for some time. With the help of the new Catalogus Catalogorum of Dr. V. Raghavan, a complete list of the Mss. of the Purāņas and the Upapurānas has been prepared. The work of bring ing out a critical edition of the Matsyapurāṇa has been going on in Madras under the guidance of Dr. Raghavan and the work of the critical edition of the Vámana purana has been undertaken by Dr. V. S. Agrawala at Benares. The semiti mentioned above has been also bringing out a Bulletin Calle Purāṇa, which publishes only Purāṇic studies by different</p>
<ol start="35">
<li>The Purānas</li>
</ol>
<p>416</p>
<p>scholars aiming at the elucidation of the textual and other problems relating to the subject-matter embodied in the Purānas.</p>
<p>The preparation of a subjectwise encyclopaedia of Purāṇic material, publication of popular expositions of Puranas in English or Hindi are among the lines of work that are includ ed among the objectives of the Purāna Prakāśana Samiti. The subject-concordance of six Puranas viz. Kūrma, Linga, Matsya, Mārkandeya, Visnu and Vümuna is also ready (at the end of 1964).</p>
<p>For the critical edition of the Matsyapurāna, Dr. Raghavan is relying on more than thirty mss., all printed edi tions and an old Tamil translation. Besides, as each indivi. dual Purāna is closely connected with many other Purānas and is almost all Purānas have numerous common topics, Dr. Raghavan is using the other Puranas for parallel portions contained in them. As Purānas have been quoted in numerous Dharmagāstra works, Dr. Raghavan has collected all quote tions from the Matsya-purāna in nibandha works on Dharmasastra. His plau of work on the Matsya has been set forth in his Presidential Address at the 21st session of the All India Oriental Conference held at Srinagar in 1961.</p>
<p>As the project of the critical editions of the Purānas is a long-term one, Vyāga Institute on a permanent basis at Benares is going to be established in the near future.</p>
<p>The constitution of the original text of the purānas is a Herculean task which has not yet been attempted. Not only is there difference of opinion among the purānas about the Dames of the 18 Maha-Purānas, but there is divergence as regards the extent of the several purävas. For example, the commentator Visnucitta of the Vişnupuräna says (on III. 6. 20-22 ) that the extent of the Visnupurāṇa is variously given at 8000, 9000, 10000, 22000, 24000, but that he comments on a text of 6000 slokas only. The Agnipurāna ( 272.10-11 ) says that it contains 12000 slokas, while the Bhāgavata (XII. 13 ), the Brabmavaivarta, the Padma (ādi. 62 ) say that it contains 15400 slokas and the Skanda (V. 3) and the Matsya 53 giver the extent of the Agni as 16000. The Kūrma, according tortice the Bhagavata, contains 17000, according to the Matsya 18700 and only 8000 according to the Agni ( 272. 19).

<p>and practices, yet the popular religion of modern Hindus is pre-eminently paurīnic. The Purīvas contain thousands of slokas on dharinaśāstra matters, they are a rich mine awaiting exploration by careful students of social and religious questions and shed a flood of light on the deve</p>
<p>f light on the development of reli gious beliefs and practices in meilieval and modern India. Therefore, the re-constitution of the text of the purānas is a problem that will have to be tackled in the near future. Be sides the several Mahāpurīnas, eighteen Upapurăņas also are enumerated in some of the Puranas. Vide Garuda (223.17 ff),488 Skanda (V. 3. chap. 1. 45-62 and VII. I. char. 2), Padma (Pätāla-khanda chap. 111. 95-98 and Matsya ( 53. 59 ff) for Upapurānas. The Matsya-purana (chap. 53, verse 58 ) states that the 18 purinas reached in extent four lakho of verses and also states that there were upabhodus (i.e. Upapurāvas ) and names some of them viz. Nārasimha, Nānda, (Nandam), Samba and Aditya. Besides the Malõpurānas and Upapurānas, there are other works of the purīna class such as Ganesa, Maudgala, Devi, Kalki &amp;c. The Padmapurana (Uttarakhanda chap. 263 ) divides the 18 Purānas into three groups, sättvika, rājusa and tāmesa and says that the Visuu, Nāradiya, Bhá gavata, Garuda, Padma aud Varāha are sättvika. The Matsya ( 53 ) also speaks of this division. The Lingapurīna (39. 63 66 ) speaks of the twenty expounders of dharma just as Yājñavalkya does and quotes the two verses in the form in which the Mit. presents them (and not Visvarūpa ), while the Padma (Uttarakhanda 263. 86-89 ) divides the eighteen gmộtis into three groups of sättvika, rājasa and tāmasa. 480 It would be quite clear to any reader of the purānas and the smrtis that most of the former in their extant form are later than the smrtis of Manu, Yājňavalkya, Parāśara, Nārada &amp;c. 458 3fotografa A: afirana OI 377F ARTTTH ARTHEAUT</p>

<p>The following table will give some idea as to how the eighteen principal purānas are rich in dharmaśāstra material. Besides the eighteen principal purānas, the Kālikā-purāņa (Venkateśvara press ed.) and the Saura-pura (Ananda srama ed.) have been drawn upon. The Anandāsrama editions of the Agni, Pauma, Matsya and Väyu and the Niruayasagara edition of the Bhagavata and the Venkatesvara Press editions of the other Purīnas have generally been relied upon in the present edition of the 1st volume.</p>
<p>It may be stated here that the Smrti chapters in the Puranas are very much influenced by Manu, Yāj., Nārada and mostly by the first.</p>

<li>The Yājnavalkyasmrti This smrti has been published dozens of times. In the following the Nirnayasāgara edition edited by Sāstri Moghe ( 1892 A. D. ) has been used and the Trivandrum edition when speaking of Viśvarūpa.</li>

<p>The name of Yājña valkya is one of the most illustrious among Vedic sayes. He is credited with having promulgated the White Yajurveda. In the Suntiparva (chap. 312 ) we are told that there was a rupture between Vaišampāyana and his pupil Yājňavalkya and that by worshipping the Sun the latter received the revelation of the White Yajurveda, the Satapatha etc. The accounts in the Visuu (3. 5 ), the Bhagen vata ( XII. 6. 61-74 ) and other purānas differ somewhat from the one in the Mahabharata, but all agree on the fact of them strained relations between Yājña valkya and bis teacher. There</p>

<p>History of Dharmasastra</p>
<p>Satapatha Brāhmana in several places alludes to the dialogues of Yājñavalkya and king Janaka of Videha on agnihotra (S. B. E. vol. 44 p. 46 ). Vide Sata patha ( ed. by Weber ) XI. 6.2. At the end of the Satapatha we are told that Vājasaneya Yājñavalkya promulgated the bright Yajus formula received from the Sun.480 In the Brhadāraṇyaka Upanişad Yājña valkya appears as a great philosopher teaching the recondite doctrines of Brahma and immortality to one of his two wives, the philosophically minded Maitreyi ( II. 4 and IV. 5). In the same Upanişad Yājñavalkya is represented as carrying away the one thousand cows set apart by Janaka for the most learned Brāhmana (III. 1. 1-2) and Yājña valkya is said to have imparted to Janaka the knowledge of the destiny of the soul after it is released from the bonds of flesh and worldly affec tions. Kātyāyana in his Vārtika on Päņini (IV. 3. 105 )461 speaks of the Brāhmania8 of Yājñavalkya and very heated controversies have raged round the correct interpretation of the Vārtika apd the Mahābhāsya thereon ( vide Max Müller&rsquo;s Ancient Sanskrit Literature p. 360, Goldsticker&rsquo;s Panini, p. 132 ff and S. B. E. vol. 12 pp. XXXV-XXXVIII). The contro versies centre round the word &lsquo;tulyakálāni&rsquo; in the Mahā bhāsya. It may mean either ( 1 ) that the Brāhmaṇa works by Yājñavalkya (mentioned as &lsquo;Yajñavalkāni Brāhmanāni&rsquo;) are also &lsquo;purāna-prokta&rsquo; but in their case the affix &lsquo;uini&rsquo; (in ) is not applied ; yet they are as old as those referred to in the Sūtra, or (2) that the Brāhmanas like those promul gated by Yājšāvalkya are co-eval with Pāṇini and hence not</p>
<p>purāna-prokta ' and the termination &lsquo;ņini&rsquo; does not apply to them. Western scholars held that Panini made a distinc tion between old and later Brāhmana works and regarded Yāj. Brāhmanas as co-eval with himself.</p>
<p>It is to be noted that in the Yājûa valkyasmrti itself488 (III. 110 ) the author, whoever he may be, claims the author ship of the Araṇyaka that he received from the Sun and the Yogaśāstra composed by him. This is simply put in to glori fy the Yājňavalkya-smrti as the work of a great and ancient 480 आदित्यानीमानि शुक्लानि यजूंषि वाजसनेयेन याज्ञवल्क्येन ख्यायन्ते । शतपथ</p>

<p>sage, philosopher and yogin. From the style and the doct rines of the smrti it is impossible to believe that it was the work of the same band that gave to the world the Upanisad containing the boldest philosophical speculation couched in the simplest yet the most effective language. Even orthodox Indian opinion was not prepared to admit the unity of author ship in the case of the smrti and the Aranyaka. The Mitāk sarā says at the beginning that some pupil of Yâj. abridg. ed the dharmaśāstra in the form of a dialogue.463 It will be shown later on that, though the sage who promulgated the Aranyaka and the author of the smrti cannot be identical, yet the Yājsavalkya-smrti is much more closely connected with the White Yajurveda and the literature particularly be longing to it than with any other Veda.</p>
<p>The Yājñavalkyasmrti contains in the Nirnayasāgara ed. of 1892 ) 1010 verses, while the Trivandrum edition with the commentary of Visvarūpa contains 1003 verses and Apa rărka gives 1006 ( Auandāśrama edition ). The difference in the number is mostly due to the fact that Visvarūpa in the first section on acāra omits five verses that occur in the Mitak ßară. *84 As regards one of them (the verse &lsquo;rathyā kardama toyāni&rsquo; I. 197 according to the Mit. ) Visvarūpa notices it and says that some read it after the verse “mukhajā vipruşā&rdquo; and that it adds nothing to what precedes. Aparārka ex plains that verse. In the second section on vyavahāra Visvarūpa reads verses 465 which do not exist in the Mitāk şarā nor in A parārka. On the other hand Visvarüpa seems to doubt the authenticity of the well-known verse on re</p>

<p>union and reads it also differently 488 (anyodaryasya samsșsti). Two verses that are Yāj. III. 255&ndash;56 (Rajakavyādhao' and</p>
<p>Svapākam pulkasam°.') in Visvarūpa&rsquo;s text are not fuund in the Mitākşarī nor in Aparırka.</p>
<p>Not only this but in some cases the arrangement of ver ses is not the same in both Visvarūpa and the Mit. For example, verses 14-29 of the prāyaścitta section present very different sequences in both. What is verse 29 in the Trivan drum edition is verse 19 in the Mit. Besides, the Mit. reads one verse (III. 23 â dantajanmanah &amp;c. ) which is wanting in Visvarūpa and is also not commented upon by Aparārka. Visvarūpa adds two half verses,467 which do not occur in the Mit. and Aparārka. There is further a good deal of variance in the readings adopted by Visvarūpa and the Mit., though the meaning is not often affected. For example, the two verses enumerating the names of writers on dharma are differently worded in both.488 But Medhătithi favours the reading of Višvarūpa. 480 Viśvarūpa reails &ldquo;asvattam loka vidvistam&rdquo; ( I. 155 ) and notices a reading &ldquo;asvantam,&rdquo; while the Mit. reads &ldquo;asvargyam loka &amp;c. ” Both the Mit. and Aparārka read “pitā pitämaho bhrātī &amp;c.” (I. 63 ), while Visvarūpa reads &ldquo;pitā mātāmaho bhrāti,” remarks that &ldquo;mátámaha&rdquo; is put in earlier as a guardian for marriage for metrical reasons and then notices “piti pitämaho bhrātā&rdquo; as à various reading. Even in the days of Visvarūpa there were various readings in Yij. ( Vide com. on I. 1, 2, 51, II. 119,</p>
<p>179 etc.).</p>
<p>The Agnipurāla affords an excellent check for the consi deration of the text of the Yājñavalkyasmrti. A good-sized monograph will be required to deal exhaustively with the questions raised by the comparison of the vyavahāra portion of the Agnipurāņu with Yijñavalkya&rsquo;s vyavahāra-kānda.</p>

<p>I shall only briefly examine the inaterials and state the con clusions at which I have arrived. We know that Visvarūpa, the first extant commentator of Yaj., flourished about 800-825 A. D. The author of the Mitūksarī flourished about 250 years later. Interesting results follow by a comparison of the text that these two commentators had before them with the Agni purāņa. I shall select chap, 256 of the Agnipurāna for a detailed examination. It contains 36 verses which all occur in Yaj. II. (verses 118-153 of Tri. ed. and verses 114-149 of the Mit.). It is found that the Agnipurīna agrees with the text of 12 verges word for word as contained in Visvarūpa and 19 verses as contained in the Mit. Viśvarūpa puts three verses between the two verses pitưdravyāvināśena &amp;c.' and &lsquo;kramidablyāgatam dravyam&rsquo;, while the Mit. brings the two verses together. In several cases the readings of the Agripu räna agree with Visvarūpa&rsquo;s text and not with that of the Mit. For example, Agni. reads &lsquo;käryāh patnyaḥ samāṁsikāḥ&rsquo; with Vis. (119), reads bhūryă&hellip; dravyam. eva vā&hellip; putrasya cobhayoh' with Viś. (124), reads &lsquo;pitrdravyāvināśena&rsquo; (and not ovyavirodhena' as Mit. does ) with Viś. ( 122 ), reads * dadyāt-căpaharec-cāmsan' with Viś. ( 142 b ), reads &lsquo;Patitas -tatsutaḥ klibah&rsquo; with Viś. ( 144 a ), reads &lsquo;aprajāyāmatītā yām&rsquo; with Viś. ( 148 ). The Agnipurāna, however, in a far larger number of cases agrees with the readings of the Mit. Ayni (256.8) reads with the Mit. (122) &lsquo;vibhaktesu suto jātah gavarnāyām vibhāgabhāk,&rsquo; Agni. reads mātāpyamsam samun haret' with the Mit. ( 123 ), wbile Viś. ( 127 ) reads &lsquo;mătăpyamsam samārnuyāt.&rsquo; Visvarūpa&rsquo;s reading leaves it undecided as to what the share of the mother is to be, while the Mit. makes it definite by stating that it is equal ( to that of a son. ). Agni ( 256.12) reads &lsquo;catustri-dvyeka-bhāgāh syuh&rsquo; and &lsquo;vidjästu dvyekabhāgi nah&rsquo; with the Mit. ( 125 ) ; Ayni ( 256.21 ) reads-&lsquo;rdhebhāgi kaṁ&rsquo; with the Mit. (134). Agni. ( 256.27) reads &lsquo;andhos cikitsyarogādyā&rsquo; with the Mit. ( 140 ), while Viś. ( 144 ) reads</p>
<p>rogi ca.' The reading of the Mit. makes provision by the word &lsquo;Ādya&rsquo; for other persons like deaf-mutes mentioned in other smrtis as not entitled to inherit, while Viś. has to put forced interpretation on &lsquo;cu&rsquo;as including such persons. The Agni ( 256.33 ) reads &lsquo;vyayam dadyac-ca sgdayam&rsquo; with the Mit. ( 146 ), while Vis. ( 150 ) reads &lsquo;dūpyas-ca sodayam Agni ( 256.36 ) reads &lsquo;vibhāgabhāvanā jñeyā gpha-ksetraat 09</p>

<p>yautakaih&rsquo; with the Mit. (149), while Vis (153) reads</p>
<p>obhāvanā deyā grha-ksetrakayautakaih.&rsquo; Here the former reading is easy and gives a complete sentence. With Vis. we have to separate bhāvanā&rsquo; and &lsquo;ādeya &amp;c.&rsquo; Besides, no pre dicate (like jñeyā or kāryā) is expressly mentioned in the verse if we take the reading of Viś, and the &lsquo;ka&rsquo;in &lsquo;ksetraka&rsquo; is a redundancy. We find that the tendency of the readings of the Mit. is to smooth down harsh or involved constructions and that the Aynipurāna presents most of the changes in the text found in the Mit. but not found in Vis. In the same direction points the fact that Agni ( 256.35 ) reads &lsquo;na dattam stridhanam yasyai&rsquo; with the Mit. ( 148 ) and not &lsquo;yasyā&rsquo; as Vis. (152) does, as `yasyai ’is grammatically more regular than &lsquo;yasyāh&rsquo; with the form &lsquo;dattam.&rsquo; But as against this we may note that both Viś. and Agni read &lsquo;aprajāyāmati tāyāın&rsquo;, while the Mit. reads &lsquo;atītāyāmaprajasi .&rsquo; The reading &lsquo;aprajasi&rsquo; is correct according to Pānini (V. 4. 122 ) and not &lsquo;aprajāyām&rsquo;. Therefore, the conclusion that follows is that the text of Yāj. preserved in the Agnipurāna is intermediate between the text of Visvarūpa and that of the Mitūksară. As Visva rūpa flourished about 800-825 A. D., the Agnipurāna repre sents a text of Yājsavalkya current somewhat later i. e. about 900 A. D. In my &lsquo;History of Sanskrit Poetics&rsquo; (pp. III-V) I established, from the fact that the extant Agnipurāna quotes Dandin and Bhämaha and knew the theory of dhvani, that it was composed about 900 A. D. That date is strikingly corro borated by the evidence derived from the chapters on vyava hāra discussed above. It is no doubt true that the Agni pre. sents some readings that are found neither in Viś. nor in the Mit. For example, it reads ( 256.4 ) &lsquo;tābhya șterpayet&rsquo;, while both Viś. and Mit. read tābhya rtesnvyah.&rsquo; It is probable that this is an error of the copyists or the reading may be due to the difficulty of understanding the meaning of &lsquo;anvayaḥ&rsquo; there. Agni reads ( 256.5) &lsquo;svayam-arjayet&rsquo; for &lsquo;svayam arjitam&rsquo; (of Viś. and Mit. ) and jātopi dāsyām sūdrasya' (256.20 ) for ogūdrena' (of Viś, and Mit.). A detailed exa mination of the other chapters on vyavahāra will yield the same results. But it cannot be undertaken here. A few examples may however be cited. Viś. ( II. 167 ) reads pelo yeşām ca te mocyā daiva-rajapariplutāḥ', Agni 51</p>
<p>pālo yeşām tu te mocyā daivarāja pariplutāh,' while out. (163) reads &ldquo;pālo yesām na te&hellip;&hellip; tāḥ'. Similarly, it (11.179 ) and Agni (257.26 ) read &lsquo;svakuțumbā vindben</p>

<p>deyam&rsquo;while the Mit. ( 175 ) reads (svam kutumbāvirodhena.&rsquo; Vis. (II. 203 ) reads &ldquo;galat-sabhikavşddhistu,' while both Agni ( 257.49 ) and Mit. (II. 199 ) read &lsquo;glahe satikavệddhe stu,&rsquo; which certainly is an easier reading. Agui 258.45 occurs in Mit. ( 255 ), but is wanting in Visvarūpa. Yüj. II. 228 in Viś. becomes in the Mit. verse 263, Agni following the order of Visvarūpa.</p>
<p>The total number of verses on vyavahāra in Agnipurāņa, chap. 253-258, is 315. Out of this the first 31 are not taken from Yāj. All of them except the first half verse and verse 31 (chap. 253 ) occur in Närada. Of the remaining 284 verses, only 4 (Agni 253. 35, 255. 438, 255. 49b and 50, 258. 83 ) do not occur in Yaj. (in both Viś. and Mit). There are also a few verses that occur in the Agnipurāna and in Visvarūpa. but not in the Mit. and also a few verses that are common to the Mit. and Ayni but are not found in Vis. The first three verses of Yāj. II are compressed by the Agnipurāņa into 1) verses.</p>
<p>The Garudapurāna affords, like the Agnipurāṇa, material help towards examining the authoritativeness of the text of the first and third sections of Yiij. The Aguipurīna does not expressly say that it drew upon Yüj., but the Gurudapurāņa is explicit on the point. In chup. 93.1. it is expressly said that the dhuria formerly promulgated by Yijùavalkya is being narrated &lsquo;Yājîjavalkyena yat (yalı ? ) purvam dharmam (dharmah ? ) proktam (&lsquo;tah?) katham Hare i tan me katlaya kesighna yathā tattvena Madhavall.&rsquo; Chapters 93-106 con tain dharmaśāstra material more or less taken from the Yäjñavalkyasınşti. There are 376 verses in these chapters. Considerations of space forbid any detailed examination of this material. A few salient facts only are brought out here. Chapters 93-102 deal with the several topics (prakaranas) of the first kända in the same order, the only exception being the topics of rajadharmu (1. 309-308 ), which is omitted in the Garudapurāna. Chapters 102-10.j treat of topics that occur in the third kända of Yāj. and contain 121 verses only. In these chapters the order of the prakaranas in Yāj. is Dones observed at all, but Garuva speaks of them in the following order: vāna prastha-prakarana, yati, karinavipāka, prāyascita āśauca and a paddharma ( the last two being the first twirusa prakarauas in Yāj.). A feature which strikes one as regarda the Garudapurana (particularly chap. 102-106 ) is that a fer perche</p>

<p>verses only of Yāj. are repeated word for word, that very often the Garudapurāņa gives only a summary by omitting and transposing the words and phrases of the original and that sometimes it adds verses of its own. This may be illug trated by what the Garuda says on vānaprastha and yati (chap. 102-103, 12 verses in all). Chap. 102 begins &lsquo;vāna prasthāśramaṁ vaksye tac-chravantu maharsayaḥ putresu bhāryām niksipya vanaṁ gacchet sahaiva váll.&rsquo; The latter half is a paraphrase of Yaj. III. 45a. Then III. 45b&ndash;46 (Mit.)= Garuda 102.2-3a ( with slight variations ), III.47 = Garuda 102-4 6-52 ; III. 18 = 3b-4a ; III. 49-50 = Garuda 5b (pakşe māsetha vāśniyād-dantolūkhaliko bhavet&rsquo;, which summarises and retains some words of the original), III. 71 - Garuda 102.6a (cāndrāyani svapedblumau karma kuryāt phalādina, which includes a few words of 11 I. 49b also ), 111.52 = Garuda 6b-7a ( the last pāda in Garuda is &lsquo;yogabhyāsāt dinam nayet,&rsquo; while in Yāj. it is &lsquo;śaktyñ vāpi tapas-caret&rsquo;), 111.53 = Garuda 102.7. Chap. 203 contains only five verses. 111.56, 58-59 = Garuda 103. 1b-4a ( with variants ) and then Garuda adds 11 verses which are not found in Yāj. (viz. blavet-parama hamso vã ekadandi yamaditah Il siddhayogas-tyajan deham amptatvam-ihāpnuyāti dātātithipriyo jñāni grhī sraddhepi mucyate li'). The mere fact that a prakarana is omitted in the Garuda purana should cast no doubt on the existence of that prakaraṇa in the original Yāj. We do not know on what principles the borrowing took place. Besides, we find that such prakaranas as Vināyakaśānti and grahaśānti are includ ed in the Garuda (chap. 100-101 ), while rājadharma prakarana is omitted. We know that rājadharma &lsquo;figures in the sūtras aud Manu, but none of the ancient dharmasūtras, nor the Manusmặti speaks of Vivāyaka. Hence conclusions must be drawn only froin what positively occurs in the Garuda purana and not from the absence of any topic in it. The Garudapurāna sometimes follows the arrangement and form of the verses presented in Vis., sometimes it agrees with the Mit. and sometimes it is independent. For example, the two verses enumerating the authors of dharmaśāstras ( Yāj. 1. 4-5 = Garuda 93. 4-5 ) follow the readings of Vis., but not those of the Mit. In the 3rd künda, verses 14-19 of the lit. are differently arranged by Vis., and Vis. omits the dates Aparárka also ) one verse found in the Mit. (I11.23 Dus sit above, while the Mit. omits two half verses that are fouin Vis. ( vide note 313). The verse &lsquo;ī danta &amp;c.&rsquo; occurs in the</p>

<p>Garudapurāna and the two half verses in Vis. omitted by the Mit. are also omitted in Garuda. So far the Garudapurāna agrees with the arrangement preserved in the Mit. But it does not agree entirely with the Mit. The verse &lsquo;ādanta &amp;c&rsquo; is III. 23 in the Mit, and occurs before &lsquo;ahastvadatta&rsquo; but in the Garuda it occurs before &lsquo;triratram dasarātram vī (which is III. 18 in the Mit. ). Besides, verse 22 of the Mit. is read differently in the Garuda (daśa dvädaśa varnānām tathā pancadasaiva ca 1 trimsad dinăui ca tathā bhavati pretasuta. kam). It must, therefore, be said that the Garudapurāna represents an intermediate stage of readings between Viś. and the Mit. As the Garudapurīna was a popular work read by and recited for the benefit of slightly educated or illiterate people, it often introduces changes to suit their understanding. For example, the Mit. (1.296 ) reads ( us also Vis.) süryaḥ somo mahīputraḥ somaputro brhaspatih,&rsquo; while Garuda reads (chap. 101.2 ) &lsquo;süryaḥ somo mangalus&rsquo; ca budhas caiva bşhaspatih,&rsquo; thus substituting the well-knowu words Mangala and Budha for Mahiputra and Somaputra. The verse</p>
<p>krtágnikāryo bhunjite' (1.31 in the Mit. ) is placed by Vis. after &lsquo;ekadeśam - upadhyāya,&rsquo; while the Mit. places it three verses earlier. The Gurudapurina here agrees with the Mit. In some cases Garula strikes an independent path. For exa mple, in Yāj. I. 11 Viś. reads &lsquo;mūse&rsquo;to jätakarma ca,&rsquo; the Mit. reads &lsquo;māsyete jätakarma ca&rsquo;, while Garuda ( chap. 93. 11 ) gives the easy reading presave jătakarma ca'. Mit. reads (Yáj. I. 76 b) &lsquo;tyajan dăpyastrtiyāṁsam-adravyo bharanam striyah&rsquo;; Vis. omits the whole verse, while Garuda omits 1.764 (of Mit.) and reads the other half as &lsquo;sundhām tyajaństrtī. yāmśam dadyadābharanam striyah&rsquo; ( 95. 23b ). Verses 1.91-92 of the Mit. on the offspring of inixed marriages are differently read by Vis. (1.90-91 ), while the Garuda ( 96. 1 b) has the same half verse as the Mit. I. 91 a and the same half verse (96. 3 2 ) as Vis. (91 b) and reads the two half verses between them as jāto ’ın basthastu sūdrāyām visādah pãraśavopi vã ll māhişyal ksatriyajjāto vaiśyāyām mlecchusu mjiitaḥ.</p>
<p>The foregoing makes it clear that the text that the Garudapurana had before it could not have been older than that commented upon by Visvarūpa and that it represents a stage intermediate between Vis, and the Mit.</p>
<p>The above gives rise to an important question whether one can detect several strata in the Yüjžavulkyasmrti. from</p>

<p>History of Dharmaśästra</p>
<p>the fact that the sūtra of Sankha-Likhita cites Yājñavalkya among the promulgators of Jharmaśāstras ( vide note 137 ), while Yāj. himself includes Sankha-Likhita among the pro pounders of dharma (note 258 ), it may be plausibly said that Sankha-Likhita refer to an earlier Yājñavalkyasmrti than the extant one. Beyond this there is no evidence to establish that there was an earlier version of the present smrti. A comparison of the readings of Visvarūpa and the Mit. with those in the Agni and Garuda purānas has established that the text of the sinști no doubt underwent slight verbal changes between 800 and 1100 A. D. and that a few verses were added and also omitted during these centuries. But the text remained in the main the game from 700 A. D. What the original smrti contained, whether it was in prose or verse or both and whether it dealt with only ācāra and prāyascitta sections are questions on which conjectures may be advanced, but there are no substantial materials for arriving at even tolerably certain conclusions.</p>
<p>Yājñavalkya&rsquo;s work is more systematic than that of Manu. He divides the work into three sections and relegates all topics to their proper positions and avoids repetition. He treats of almost all subjects that we find in Manu, but his treatment is always concise and he makes very great and successful efforts at brevity. The result is that for the 2700 verses of Manu, he requires only a little over a thousand. He often compresses two verses of Manu into one, e. g. Manu II. 243, 247, 248 are equal to Yāj. I, 49, Manu III. 46-48 and 50 are concisely put in one verse by Yāj. (1. 79); vide also Manu IV. 7-8 and Yāj. I. 128 (contains alınost same words also ), Manu IV. 84-85 and YĂj. I. 141. Iu a few cases Manu and Yāj. convey the same meaning in one verse without compression, e. g. Manu III. 70 and Yāj. I. 102, Manu III. 119 and Yāj. I. 110. Mapu VII. 17 and Yāj. I. 348, Manu VII. 205 and Yâj. I. 349. The correspondence of Yājšavalkya&rsquo;s words with the text of Manu is in most cases very close, so much so that one cannot help feeling that Yäj. had the Manusinsti before him and purposely made an attempt to abridge the somewhat loose expressions of Manu. The passages set forth above as examples of compressions will the serve as illustrations of this fact. The word Kaya ( from KA) is used by both in the sense of prājāpatya form of marfage (Manu III. 38 and Yåj. I. 60 ); vide also Manu II. 109 Yāj. 1. 28, Manu I11. 42-44 and Yāj. I. 62, Manu V. 28-07</p>

<p>and Yāj. I. 178&ndash;179, Manu VII. 56 and Yāj. I. 312 for further close agreement in phraseology. Yāj. adds some subjects which have either no counterpart in our Manu or which are only noticed in passing by Manu. The Manusmrti contains nothing corresponding to the Vinayakaśānti and Grabaśānti of Yāj. (I. 271-308). Yāj. gives a detailed treatment of five kinds of ordeals (in II. 95-113 ), while Manu makes only a cursory reference to the ordeals of fire and water ( VIII. 114 ). Yāj. contains considerable anatomical and medical matter (III. 75– 108 ), which is wanting in Manu. On the other hand, there are some subjects on which Yāj. is silent though they are dealt with in detail by Manu. This is the case with the account of the origin of the world.</p>
<p>The whole of the Yājña valkya-smrti is written in the classical Anustubh metre. Though the author&rsquo;s great aim has been to be concise, his verses are hardly ever obscure. The style is flowing and direct. There are not many un-Pāṇinian expressions, though he employs &lsquo;pūjya’ in . 293 and &lsquo;düsya&rsquo; in II. 296. In the latter case both Visvarūpa and Aparārka avoid the fault by reading differently. The verse “kulani jātayaḥ srenyo&rsquo; is ungramınatical ( Tri. ed. II. 34 ), as jāti' and' sreņi' must be in the accusative case. According to the Mit. Yājñavalkya addressed his words to Sāmaśravas and other sages (vide com. on I. 178 and III. 330-333). In this the Mit. is probably drawing upon the Bỉ. Up. (III. 1. 2), where Yāj. asks Sámaśravas to take away the 1000 cows. The sages interpose (vide III. 118, 129 ) as in Manu, while the great teacher is passing in review one topic after another. The teacher himself addresses his auditors (as in I. 178 srunudhvam' and nibodhata&rsquo;in I. 272). Yāj. employs the first person about himself as in I. 56 &lsquo;naitan-mama matam&rsquo; and in III. 126 sahasrātinā mayā yo va ādidera udāhstah).</p>
<p>It is said that the sages approached Yājñavalkya in Mithilā and requested him to impart to them the dharmas of the varnas, āśramas and others. The contents of the work may be briefly summarised as follows:&ndash;Kānda I: fourteen vidyae; twenty expounders of dharma, sources of dharma; constitution of a parisad, the samkāras from Garbhāithiina to marrage upanayana, its time and other details; every-day duties brahmacārin, persous fit to be taught, what things and actions &amp; brahmacarin was to avoid, period of studenthood; marrinteresen</p>

<p>Besides the four Vedas, Yāj. refers to the Vedāngas as six and enumerates fourteen vidyās ( four Vedas, six angas, purāṇa, nyāya, mimāṁsā, dharmaśāstra ). He refers to the Araṇyaka and Yogaśāstra composed by himself. Araṇyakag in general are spoken of in I. 145 and Sukriya Araṇyaka in III. 309. The Upanisads are mentioned in III. 189, where Purāņas are mentioned in the plural. Itihāsas, Purāṇa, Valio vākya, and Nārāsamsi gāthās are mentioned in 1.45 ( also I 101 for Purāna and Itibāsa ). He enumerates at the comment cement nineteen authors on dharma, besides himself. But it</p>

<p>History of Dharmadāstra</p>
<p>is remarkable that in the body of the work not one individual author of a dharma-śāstra is mentioned by name. He speaks of Anviksiki (Metaphysics ) and Dandanīti (I. 311). He lays down the dictum that where dharmagāstra and artha sāstra conflict, the former shall prevail (II. 21 ). He speaks of smộtis in general (II. 5 and 1.154 ). In III. 189 (III. 180 in Visvarūpa who reads. Purānam ca ), he names several sections of Sanskrit literature viz. Vedas, Purānas, Vidyās ( Dharma sāstra and others ), Upanisads, slokas, sūtras and bhāsyas. This is an echo of Bșhadāranyakopanisad 11.4.10 and IV.5.11 quoted below.470 He speaks of sūtras and bhāsyas. What works are intended it is most difficult to say ; the only extant bhâsya which can be said with certainty to be older than the extant Yāj. smrti is that of Patañjali. He refers to other writers on dharma in the word &lsquo;eke&rsquo; (I. 36). The view re ferred to there occurs in Baud. Dh. S. 1. 2. 4.</p>
<p>Yāj. III. 185 refers to eight guņas, which appears to be a reference to Gautama Dharmasūtra 8. 23-24. Similarly, Yāj. III. 186 ( referring to 88 thousand sages who were house holders ) has in view Ap. Dh. S. II. 9. 21.3 (Astāsītisahasrāņi ye prajām-işire rsayaḥ &amp;c ). It appears that the Matsya purāna ( 53. 5-6 )471 quoted below copies the words of Yāj. I. 3 (Purāna-nyāya&hellip;&hellip;&hellip; dharmasya ca caturdaśa ) and thereby helps to some extent in arriving at the probable date of Yāj.</p>
<p>It is necessary to say a few words about the verses of the Yoga-Yājña valkya which has 12 chapters and about 496 ver ses plus ten additional verses, in all 506 only.</p>
<p>Briefly the contents of the twelve chapters are as follows: Chap. I (70 verses ) - In an assembly of sages, in which Mai treyi ( the best of married women ) and Gargi ( the best among experts in knowledge of Brahma), were present, when Gārgi prostrated herself on the ground and requested Yājñavalkya to impart to her the essence of Yoga. Yāj. agreed to impart to her the essence of Yoga together with its angas. He said</p>

<p>that he would impart to her the knowledge of Yoga which Brahmã communicated to him and requested the assembly of sages to listen to the Yoga that would be described by him. He dealt with knowledge and appropriate actions, as follows: actions are the way of knowledge which is twofold viz. pravar taka (i. e. inducing men to act) and nivartaka (i. e. making men to cease from ordinary acts). He said there are four asramas laid down by the Veda. Man owes debts to gods, ancestors and sages ( ?sis ) and pays off the debts (respectively) by sacrifices, by having sons and by brahmacarya as regards sages); there are four āśramas, all four for a brāhmana, three for a ksatriya, two for vaisyas and one for $ūdras; men in the four āśramas should perform the duties of those āśramas out of the four that may be applicable to their cases respectively; there are different angas of Yoga applicable to the persons in the community. Yoga has eight angus viz. Yama, Niyama, Asana, Prāļāyāma, Pratyāhāra, Dhāraṇā, Dhyana and Samādhi. Yamas are ten viz. Ahimsā, truthfulness, asteya &amp;c. and there are also ten niyamas viz. tapas, santoșa, ästikya, dāna, worship of god, listening to the fundamental principles of conduct, Hri, Mati, Japa ( vācika and manasa ) and vratas; (chap. 3 ) Asana ( bodily postures of eight sorts ); Nādis ( 14 chief ones such as Ida, Pingalī, Susumụā, &amp;c.); ten vāyus ( such as Prāna, Apāna &amp;c.) and their special functions ); Nadīsuddhi ( described in chap. V); Prāṇāyāma (description of ), Recaka, Pūralu, Kumbha, the mantra to be recited is to be Vedic, except for the südras and women ; (ten slokas at the end of chap. VI); seventh chap. deals with Pratya håra ; this last and three more are called abhyantara angas of Yoga. Dhāranas are of five sorts (chap. VIII ): control of Prāņa-vāyu ; IX-deals with dhyāna; chap. X-deals with Samādhi ( Samadhiḥ samatā vasthā ); chap. XI (Gārgi says that she had forgotten the Yoga with eight angas ); chap. XII-Yāj. teaches her briefly Yoga again when she said that she had forgotten the elaborate treatment that Yāj. indulged in and then Yāj. teaches her briefly the essence of Yoga ( chap. XII ).</p>
<p>Some of the recommendations of the Yoga-yājñavalkos may be stated here; such as actions enjoined by Vedia injunctions should be performed by Yogins till death ( XD</p>

<p>The Yoga-Yājñavalkya is only a small work on Yoga, has little to do with Dharmaśāstra and it winds up its teachings by relying on Hathayoga in chap. XII, which is put forward by the work itself as a summary of the teachings of the first eleven chapters.473</p>

<p>The Dānasāgara of Ballālasena (B. edition) mentions Yajñavalkya and Yogiyājñavalkya on p. 3 and it quotes about a dozen verses some of which are found in Yogi-Yājña valky8,474 chap. VII. ( of Br. Y. Y.) via abhāve ( D. S. p. 63=Br. VII. 139 ); na kuryāt (D. S. p. 52-Br. VII. 37); na cankraman (D. S. p. 52-Br. VII. 131 ); na padā (D. S. p. 63-BỊ VII. 132 ). . Yājñavalkya agrees very closely with the Visnudharma sūtra. What conclusions are to be drawn therefrom has been discussed above (see sec. 10). Similarly, there is close correspondence between the Kauțiliya aud Yāj. If there is any borrowing at all, it must follow from the date above assigned to the Kauţiliya that it is Yāj. who borrows. There are numerous passages in Yāj. that show remarkable agreement with the text of Manu. But there are several points on which Yāj. differs from Manu and shows in general a more advanced state of thought and feeling than the Manusmrti. The follow ing are the principal points wherein Yāj. differs from Manu. Manu seems to allow a brāhmaṇa to marry a sūdra girl ((III. 13 ), while Yāj. emphatically states it as his opinion that this is wrong (I. 56 ); Manu first describes the practice of niyoga and then severely condemns it (IX. 59-68 ), while Yāj. does not condemn it (I. 68-69). Manu enumerates eighteen vyavahārapadas; Yāj. does not expressly enumerate them in one place, though he defines vyavahāra pada and adds verses of a miscellaneous character (prakırnaka ) in his section on vyavahāra. Manu is silent about the rights of inheritance of</p>

<p>the widow of a sonless man and gives only a vaguely expre seed order of succession, while Yāj. places the widow at the head of all heirs and enumerates several classes of heirs in e regular order. Manu condemns gambling outright (9. 224 228), while Yaj. brought it under State control and made its source of revenue to the king (II. 200-203). There are several other matters which Yāj. treats at much greater length and more systematically than Manu, e. g. ordeals (as indicated above), means of proof in courts ( Manu altogether ignoring documentary evidence, though he knew documents as in 8. 51-52), rules of procedure in courts ( compare Manu 8. 53-56 with Yaj. II. 5-11 and 16-21 ), the doctrine of possession and prescription (Yaj. II. 24-29 and Manu 9. 44 and 54 ). All these points tend to show that the Yājnavalkya-smrti is much later than the extant Manusmşti.</p>
<p>The Yājňavalkya-smộti seems to have taken the section on Vinayakaśānti from the Mānavagļhya-sūtra (II. 14 ); verses 281-283 of Yāj. (I) occur in the Mänavagshya II. 14, but in a different order. 476 The Mänavagļhya takes the Vinā yakas to be four, while Yāj. says that there is a single Vinayaka, whose appellations are Mita. &amp;c.</p>
<p>The details of information about Vināyaka in Yåj. (I. 272-276) appear to have been versified from the prose478 of the M. Gr. S. The details of worship also and the mantra (Yaj. I. 291) are taken from the same work (vide M. Gr. S. II. 14. 30 for the mantra ). At one time the section on</p>

<p>History of Dharmaśāstra</p>
<p>Vināyakaśānti was thought to be a gure indication of the late date of Yāj. Smrti. But since the discovery of the Mānava gshya that position had to be given up. In the Baudhāyana dharmasūtra (II. 5. 21 ) we have Vinayaka and his several appellations (in the tarpaņa ). A parārka on Yāj. I. 275 quotes a long passage from the Baija vāpa-gļhya which bears a very close correspondence in phraseology to the passage from the M. Gș. S. quoted above and which gives the names of the four Vināyakas as Mita, Sammita, Salakatan kata and Kūsmāņdarāja putra.</p>
<p>The Yājñavalkya-smrti stands in a very intimate relation to the White Yajurveda and the literature that clusters round it. Most of the mantras quoted (in part) or referred to by Yāj. occur in the Rgveda as well as in the Vājasaneya-sam hită (e. g. in Yāj. I. 22, 24, 229, 230, 238, 239, 247 ). Yet there are a few mantras that do not occur in the Rgveda, but only in the Vājasaneya-saṁhitā or other saṁhitās (e. g. &lsquo;yavosi&rsquo; in Yāj. I.230, which is Vāj. S. 5. 26, &lsquo;ye samāna&rsquo; in Yáj. 1. 254 which is Vāj. S. 19.45, &lsquo;imam deva&rsquo; and &lsquo;udbudhyanva&rsquo; in Yāj. I. 300, which are Váj. S. 9. 40 and 15. 54, &lsquo;annāt pari śrutah&rsquo; and &lsquo;kandát’in Yāj. I. 301 which are Vāj. S. 19.75 and 13.20 ). Several verses ( Yaj. III. 191-197) are a para phrase of certain passages of the Brhadāranyaka Upanisad, 80 much so that the very words of the latter are used through out in the former, as the quotations given below will show.477 Then again Yāj. very closely agrees with the Pāras karagļhya sūtra as was pointed out by Dr. Stenzler in his introduction to the edition of Yāj. (1849, Berlin ) and in the Journal of the German Oriental Society (VII. 527). Visvarūpa points out 477 स ह्याश्रमैर्विजिज्ञास्यः समस्तैरेवमेव तु । द्रष्टव्यस्त्वथ मन्तव्यः श्रोतव्यश्च</p>

<p>that478 Yāj. I. 142–143 are based upon Pāraskara. The mantra ayam me vajrah&rsquo; in Yāj. I. 135 ( Trivandrum ed.) is given in Pāraskara-grhya 11.7.7. In the following also there is close verbal correspondence478 between Yāj. and the P. Gr. S; Yāj. III. 1-2 and P. Gr. S. III. 10. I, 5, 8-9 and 12: Yāj. III. 3 and P. Gr. S. III. IO. 16 and 19-20; Yāj. III. 4 and P. Gr. S. III. 10. 46-47 ; Yāj. III. 16 and P. Gr. S. III. 10. 26-27. Similarly, the verses of Yāj. on Sräddha ( I. 217-270) offer many points of contact with the Sraddha-kalpa of Kātyāyana edited by Dr. Caland (pp. 127-130 of his work &lsquo;Ahnencult &amp;c.&rsquo; From these facts Dr. Jolly concludes that Yājñavalkya&rsquo;s work goes back to a dharmasūtra of the White Yajurveda ( R. u. 8. p. 21 ). In another place Dr. Jolly hazards another conjecture based on the close correspondence between Yăj. and the Vişnudbarmasūtra that he probably belonged to the Käthaka school of the Black Yajurveda (Journal of Indian History, 1924, p. 7). Yāj. also shows great similarity to the Kauţiliya and borrows the Vināyaka-śānti from the Mānava grhyasūtra. From these facts one may argue at least with an much logic and force as underlies Dr. Jolly&rsquo;s guess-work that Yāj. probably belonged to the Mānava school of the Black Yajurveda or to the school of Kautilya. If Yāj. knew his business as a writer on Dharmaśāstra, he must have consul ted the works of his predecessors and his work is bound to show traces of that fact. One may conclude at the most tbat the author of the Yājñavalkyasmrti may have possibly been a student of the White Yajurveda and so the mantras of the White Yajurveda and the Gșhyasūtra of Pāraskara were far more familiar to him than the other Vedas, sūtras, smrtis, and other works. No such conclusions that there was a dharma sūtra of the White Yajurveda and that the Yājñavalkyasmrti was based thereon are warranted by the facts so far discovered. 478 पौषमासस्य रोहिण्यामष्टकायामथापि वा। जलान्ते छन्दसा कुर्यादुत्सर्ग विधिवद</p>

<p>History of Dharmaśāstra</p>
<p>For settling the date of Yāj. we need not consider the evidence after the 9th century A.D. For, in the first quarter of that century (as we shall see later on ) Viśvarūpa wrote his extensive commentary on Yāj. - That he was separated from Yāj. by many centuries follows from several considerations. Not only had numerous various readings arisen in the text of Yāj. when he wrote, but various interpretations of the same words and verses of Yāj. had arisen. For example, he gives several meanings of the words &lsquo;putronanyāśritadravyah&rsquo; (in Yāj. II. 47 ), of &lsquo;sāmudrāh&rsquo; (II. 41 ); he gives different inter pretations of I. 265, II. 160, II. 173 &amp;c. He refers to the interpretations of his predecessors in several places by the word &lsquo;anye&rsquo; (I. 3, 25, 155, 169; II. 21, 119, 121 ; III, 201,209, 246 &amp;c. ). In several places he appears to be referring to two other interpretations than his own ( vide on III.250, the words &lsquo;kecittu&rsquo; and &lsquo;anye tu&rsquo; and the same words on III.261 and 264). That Visvarūpa had before bim actual commentaries on Yāj. and was not merely giving scholastic interpretations started by himself is made very clear in several cases by his actually citing certain portions from those works. On 1.252 Visvarūpa says. others take from somewhere the following floke (then the sloka is quoted ), but this sloka is of no help, as its origin is not known !.480 Similar words occur in the comment on Yāj. III. 222. On II. 193 he styles some pre decessor as panditammanya' and on III. 257 he ridicules a predecessor who regards the verse of Manu IV. 222 as an arthavāda by saying that that commentator wanted to show off that he knew the technical term arthavāda.481 It is not unlikely that Viśvarūpa in this last passage refers to some ancient commentator of Manu such as Asahāya.

<p>says that Sankara in his Bhāsya on Brahmasūtra (III. 4.43) explained the application of Yāj. III. 226. Unfortunately in the printed editions of Sankara I could not find this. But from the Bhāmati where Yāj. III. 226 is explained, it is clear that the passage must have occurred in the text of Sankara used by the Bhāmati. Dr. Jolly lays great emphasis in assigning a late date to Yāj. on the fact that Kumārila, who cites Manu, Gautama, Āpastamba, Baudhāyana frequently, ignores the Yājsavalkya-smrti altogether. But this silence of the great mimāṁsaka can only mean that he did not assign the same pre-eminent and venerable position to Yāj. that he assigned to Manu, Gautama and others. Dr. Jolly himself is prepared to place Yāj. three or four centuries earlier than Kuinārila. It will be shown hereafter that Nārada and Bșhaspati cannot be placed later than 500 A. D. and may have flourished two or three centuries earlier still. On a compa rison of their doctrines with those of Yāj. it will have to be conceded that they represent a far greater advance in juristic principles and exactitude than Yāj. So the latter cannot be placed later than the 3rd century A. D. As Yāj. is shown above to have followed the Manusmrti and the Kauţiliya his smrti cannot be placed earlier than the first century B.C. We shall not be therefore far from the truth if we place his smrti somewhere between the first century B. C and the third century of the Christian era. In the Lankávatārasūtra ( ed. by B. Nanjio, 1923, Kyoto ) gathas 814–816 are &lsquo;Kātyāyanaḥ sūtrakartā Yājsavalkastathaiva ca&hellip; Valmiko Masurākşasca Kautilya Āsvalāyanaḥ &hellip; From the context it appears that the author of the smrti is referred to as Yājñavalka.</p>
<p>Dr. Jolly (R. u. S. p. 21 ) following Dr. Jacobi (ZDMG 30, p. 306 ) thinks that Yāj. shows an acquaintance with Greek astrology. Dr. Jacobi&rsquo;s position amounts to this that the naming of the week days after the planets was established among the Greeks towards the end of the 2nd century A. D. and as the names of the week days and the arrangement of the planets in correspondence with them was borrowed by the</p>

<p>Indians from the Greeks, no Indian work which enumerates the week days or arranges the planets in the well-known sequence of Sun, Moon, Mars &amp;c. ) could have been composed before the third century after Christ. As is very often the case with Western Sanskrit scholars in matters of Indian chronology, this grand generalization is based upon very slender data. The premises are mere assumptions without hardly any evidence worth the name to support them. No one knows exactly when the week-days were named and who were the people that first employed the current names of the week-days. It is well-known that as far back as the days of Herodotus the Egyptians had a presiding deity for each day and that in the times of Julius Cæser there were days of Saturn (vide I. A. vol. 14, p. I, General Cunningham&rsquo;s article for the Indian origin of week-days ). At least from the third century B. C., as vouched for by the 13th edict of Asoka, India was in close touch with Syria and Egypt, where Bud dhist missionaries had been sent by Asoka while Antiochus and Ptolemy ruled in the two countries respectively. There fore, if Indians at all borrowed the week-days and the arrangement of planets from foreigners, there is nothing to prevent us from holding that they might have borrowed them from the Egyptians.</p>
<p>The present author has dealt at some length with the question of the origin of week days and their names in pp. 676-685 of Vol. V part I of the History of Dharmaśāstra. It is impossible to hold that such a brilliant planet as Venus whose rising precedes the dawn and setting follows the evening was not noticed by the ancient Indians. It is very likely that Vena praised in Rg. X.123.1,2 and 5 is the morning star and in X. 123.5 Uşas the youthful (yosā ) Apsaras that greets with a smile in the highest heaven her lover i.e. the morning star that is a little high up in the sky when Usas smiles on the horizon. In a difficult verse ( Rg. 1.139.10) both Bșhas pati and Vena are mentioned. Several Western scholars hold that Vena is Soma or Sürya according to the context. But this explanation would not suit Ry. X. 123. 1 and 5 at all. In Rg. X. 123.1 we have the words ' Ayam venas codayat&hellip;imam apām sangame sūryasya&rsquo; and it is clear that &lsquo;imam &lsquo;restore to Vena (in the first half) and “süryasya&rsquo; is separatet mend tioned from imam&rsquo; (i. e. Venam ). The earliest datending record ( so far known ) wherein a week-day is mentioned 18</p>

<p>the Era» Inscription of 484 A. D. (Gupta Inscriptions p. 89) where we have&rdquo; Suraguror divase.&rdquo; It is to be noticed that Yāj. does not mention the week-days. Ip I. 296 he mentions the nine grahas in order as the Sun, the Moon, Mars (the son of the earth ), Mercury (the son of Soma ), Jupiter, Venus, Saturn, Rāhu, Ketu. No one can gainsay that at least the Sun, the Moon, Bphaspati and Venus were known to the Rgvedic India. Bịhaspati in the highest beaven is spoken of in the Rgveda483 and the conjunction of Jupiter and Tisya (constellation of Pusya ) is spoken of in the Tai. Brābmana. We know so very little of the ancient astronomical science in ancient India that one must think twice before dogmatising. Yāj. nowhere mentions the zodiacal signs (rāśis) and probably did not know them. Not only so, in his day the naksutras were still arranged from Krttikā to Bharani as was the case in the Tai. S. IV. 4.10. Vide Yāj. I. 268 (Kșttikādi Bharanyantam ). We know from Varāhamihira that in the 5th century A. D. the signs of the zodiac and the arrangement of Naksatras from Asvini to Revati were established facts in all parts of India. Therefore, Yâj. who uses the ancient arrangement of Nakşat ras cannot be placed so late as the 4th century A. D. When Yāj. (1. 80 ) speaks of “susthe Indau &quot; we should not, follow ing such commentaries as the Mit., connect the words with the signs of the zodiac or the houses of the horoscope. Visvarūpa does not speak of rāśis in this connection, but of Naksatras only. From very ancient times certain Nakşatras had come to be regarded as auspicious or suitable for particular acts. The Tai. Br. 484 directs that one should not finish a thing or begin to sacrifice ou a naksatra with an evil name. The same Brāhmaṇa says that ploughing was to be begun on the Maitra asterism (Anuradha ) and consecration of fire on the Aditya naksatra. Even the Rgveda speaks of auspicious day8486 and the Tai. Br. speaks of Deva-nakşatras and Punyāhas, and says</p>

<p>that a daughter should be given away in marriage on the Svāti naksatra if she was desired to be her husband&rsquo;s favourite *86 Vide Baudhāyana Gșhya (I. 1 ) for the marriage nakṣatras ; also Āp. Gr. S. II. 15. 12-14, Gobhila Gphya 4.4. 28 and 2. 1.1.</p>
<p>There is nothing to show that Yāj. knew rāfis ( zodiacal signs). He refers ( I. 80 ) to the Maghā and Müla nakşatras as forbidden for sexual intercourse between husband and wife. The presiding deity of both Maghã and Mula was pitaraḥ (deceased ancestors ); vide H. of Dh. Vol. V part 1 pp. 502-3 for both. Therefore, they are both inauspicious. Similarly, some of the tithia viz. Amāvāsyā, 8th and 14th tithis and Full Moon day were prohibited by Manu (IV. 128 ) for sexual intercourse between husband and wife. Hence times for many actions in early works were of three sorts viz. forbidden, recommended, or neutral (i. e. neither forbidden nor recom mended). When Yāj. speaks (in 1.80) of the moon being auspiciously placed, or when he speaks of a planet being badly placed ( duḥotha ) in 1.307, it is improper to jump to the conclusion that he refers to rāsis, but he might have in mind nakşatras (like Mūla and Mugha ) or tithis ( like Amå vāsyā or 8th ). The same remark applies to the words. Vyati pāta andGajacchāyā' that occur in Yāj. I.217. Both are times for srāddha and variously defined (not necessarily depending on rādis ). Vide H. of Dh, vol. V. pp. 419 and 705 for Vyatipāta' and Vol. IV p. 371 n for Gajacchāyā and Vyatīpāta both.</p>
<p>In III. 171 and 172 Yāj. speaks of only the conjunction of planets and of the passage of them ) through tārās and maksatras. The Baud. Dh. S. II. 5.23 gpeaks of the nine grahas in the same order as that of Yāj. Therefore, there is hardly any evidence to show that Yāj. knew more astrology than was current in the days of the Brāhmanas and the Grbyasūtras. Yāj. (in II. 240-241 ) speaks of the fine to be imposed on those who counterfeited &ldquo;nāņakas” (coins ) and on those examiners of “nānakas&rdquo; who falsely declared a good coin to be counterfeited and vice versa. Mr. Jayaswal( Cal cutta Weekly Notes, vol. 17, P. CLIX ) says that nāņaka is the</p>

<p>gold coin of the Kushans bearing the picture of the Goddess Nanaia and that the Kushans did not rise to importance be fore 78 A. D. This would place Yāj. after 100 A. D. But it must be remembered that this connection between the Goddess Nanaia and the word &ldquo;nānaka” is quite conjectural and that the chronology of the Kushans is far from being settled.</p>
<p>Yaj. speaks of the sight of yellow-robed people as an evil omen (1.273), which is probably a reference to the Buddhists; though it has to be remembered that he prescribes old yellow (kāsáya ) robes for his seeker after moksa ( III. 157). He speaks of the founding of monasteries of Brāhmanas learned in the Vedas (11.185). The philosophical doctrines contain ed in the third section ( verses 64-205 ) approach that phase of the Vedānta that was taught by Sankarācārya. Vide parti cularly III. 67, 69, 109, 119, 125, 140. He employs in elucidat ing the philosophy of Atman the well-known examples of gbaţākāģa and of the reflection of the Sun in water (III. 144 ), of the various ornaments made from gold, of the spider spinn ing webs out of his own body ( both in III.147 ), of the actor representing various parts (III. 162 ). All these illustrations frequently occur in Sarkara&rsquo;s Särirakabhāsya (e. g. ghată kāśa on Vedānta-sūtra II. I. 14, spider on II. 1.25). All these points, however, are of very little use in arriving at a definite age for the smrti of Yāj. The foregoing discussion has established that Dr. Jolly&rsquo;s date (viz. 4th century A. D. in R. u. S., p. 21 ) is much later than the data warrant. There is nothing to prevent us from holding that the extant smrti was composed during the first two centuries of the Christian era or even a little earlier.</p>
<p>Prof. K. P. Jayaswel in his Tagore Law Lectures on &lsquo;Manu and Yājñavalkya&rsquo; has given forceful expression to some novel views. A separate treatise would have to be written for ex posing the hollowness of some of his assertions. But one question concerns the text itself and cannot be altogether ignored here. On pp. 56 ff he asserts that verses 67-203 of the third adhyāya of YĀj. are interpolations. The main reasons for this opinion are that these verses contain matters of anatomy and Yoga. This is a very bad example of foisthaga one&rsquo;s own modern ideas about relevancy on writers who flourished about two thousand years ago. The Nárada-small has a long disquisition on impotency ( vide SBE, vol. 33</p>

Manusmrti contains a good deal of matter on Yoga e. g. vide Manu VI. 70-73; Yāj. 111.67 imitates Mundakopanişad II. 1.1 (in thought and words ), Yāj. 111.71 contains ideas common to Manu III. 76 and Santi parva 264.11 ; Yāj.

VI. 2.16; Yāj. III. 200 re peats the very words of Gītā VI. 11 and XII. 4 in part.</p>
<p>Besides the Yājñavalkyasmști we have to reckon with three other works connected with the name of Yājñavalkya, viz. Vrddha Yāj., Yoga-Yāj., and Bșhad-Yāj. All these three works are comparatively ancient. Visvarūpa quotes ( vide note 219 above ) two verses of Vrddha-Yājñavalkya saying that many writers on dharma have been born and will be born and enumerating ten such writers.</p>
<p>The Mit. on YĀj. III. 1-2, 6, 19 quotes six verses of Věddha-Yāj and Aparārka quotes about eleven. The verse of Vệddha-Yāj. quoted as &lsquo;cândāla&hellip;Pärasīkādikam’in the note is quoted again by Aparārka differently on p. 1196.</p>
<p>One quotation cited from Vrddha-Yāj. by Madhava refers to the means of proof in case of doubt whether there was . partition.487 So Vệddha&ndash;Yāj. wrote also on Vyavabăra. Most of the quotations occur in the prāyascitta section. It is interesting to note that one of these quotations in Aparărka488 regards the touch of Parasīkas as on the game level with that of Candālas, Mlecchus and Bhillas. The Dāyabbāga489 says that Jitendriya cited the words of Brhad-Yajõavalkya (viz. “sodaro nānyamātrjaḥ ”). The Mit. cites Brhad Yājñavalkya on prāyaścitta. So this also is a work that must be held to be earlier than 1000 A. D. Yāj. himself is styled</p>

<p>Yogisvara by the Mit. and other works, but Yoga-Yājie valkya is a different work from the Yāj. Smrti. Yāj. (in III. 110) claims the Yogaśāstra to be his own work.</p>
<p>The Garudapurāna in chapters 93-106 contains about 376 verses, most of them borrowed from the Yāj. Smrti and adds a few verses of its own. It does not follow the order of verses in the Smrti. The Mit. on Yāj. III. 253 quotes a verse of Bịhad-Yajñavalkya stating that a Ksatriya or Vaisya even knowingly drinking madya does not become blamable, (but he incurs sin if he drinks liquor prepared from flour). The Mit, on Yāj. III. 253 quotes à verse of Brhad-Visuu setting out ten kinds of madya, all forbidden to Brāhmanas only but not to others.</p>
<p>Long after the first volume of the H. of Dh, was publi shed two works have been brought out, one called Brhadyogi Yājñavalkya edited and published in 1951 by Swami Kuva layananda of the Kaivalyadhama at Lonavla and Pandit Raghunath Shastri Kokje and the other by Mr. P. C. Divanji published at first in J. B. B. R. A. S. Vol. 28 (pp. 98-158 and pp. 215-268 ) and vol. 29 pp. 96-128 and later available in book form (in 1954 ). Mr. Divanji in J. B. B. R. A. S. vol. 29 pp. 96-128 deals with his mss., his method of collation, the work and its date, index of verses and glossary of words. In A. B. O. R. I. Vol. 34 pp. 1-29 Mr. Divanji tries to establish that the work he published is the Yogaśāstra said to have been composed by the author of Yaj. Smrti (III. 110 ) before the smrti. The Lonavla editors replied in ABORI. Vol. 37 pp. 279-289 and in their Journal called Yogamīmāṁsā Vol. VII. No. 2 ( also issued as a pamphlet in 1958 ). The present author cannot enter into lengthy criticism of what Mr. Divanji says, who does not keep an open mind as befits a scholar who is in search of truth. The Trivandrum Sanskrit Series also published (in 1938 ) the Yoga-Yájñavalkya ( based on a single Ms. ) which generally agrees with the work edited by Mr. Divanji. The present author has to bring to the notice of scholars and readers the fact that the Yogayājñavalkya was published in the Trivandrum Series ( No. CXXXIV ) 80 fan back as 1938. The present author examined the question whether any one of these two works can be the Yogasā to which the Yāj. Smrti (III. 110) says was composed by the sage Yājsavalkya, a. of the Yīj. Smrti, in H. of Dh. VoD</p>

<p>on each.</p>
<p>part 2, pp. 1404-1408. Those interested may read that dis cussion. The findings there are that none of the two works could have been the composition of the author of the Yāj. Smrti.</p>
<p>As both works are interesting ( particularly the one published at Lonavla ) the present author will say a few words on each.</p>
<p>The Brhad-Yogiyājñavalkya is a large work in twelve chapters and has about 930 verses. It begins just as the Yāj. Smrti does ( sages ask Yogišvara who was in Mithila, ques tions). The twelve chapters deal with the following topics. I (verses 44 ); the essence of all Vedas, Smrtis and 14 vidyās; knowledge of Ātman; five matters to be remembered at the time of performing japa of Mantras viz. the sage, the metre, the deity addressed, the application of mantras and (fifthly ) the explanation, origin, purpose and praise (i. e. the Brāh mana of it); II ( verses 158 ) about Omkāra (pranava ), it being a mantra by itself, eight different views about the mātrās of it ( Yājñavalkya&rsquo;s view being that it is &lsquo;amātra&rsquo;); III (verses 32 ) On the Vyābřtis (either 3, 4, 5 or 7); IV (verses 82 ) on Gayatrī, its sage, metre, deity and its employ ment; V. (12verses ) on Nyāsa of Om, Vyāhịtis, Gayatri on the different parts of one&rsquo;s body ; VI ( verses 31 ) on Sandhyo pāsana (morning and evening worship ); VII (196 verses ) on bath, tarpana, sandhyā worship and japa (mutter ing of mantras); VIII (56 verses ) on Prānāyāma and Pratyāhāra ; IX ( verses 198, the longest chap. in the work ) on Dhyana; definition of Dhyāna; ( dhyāna being placed before dhāraņā ); X ( verses 201 ) on Sūryopastbăna ( worship of the Sun with mantras and Gāyatrijapa ); XI (56 verses ) practice of Yogadharma; XII (verses 49 )-All Sāstras originated from Veda, 14 vidyās means of knowing the proper dharma, greatness of Manu &amp;c.</p>
<p>This work in its extensive remarks on Mantras, Gāyatri, Sandhyopāsana, bath, tarpaņa, prānāyāma deals with Dharma dāstra matters and combines with them the higher Yoga viz. pratyāhāra, dhyāna and dhāranā (as in VIII. 29, 30, 32 which are the same as Manu VI. 70-72). It quotes dozens of verses from the Manusmrti. It also contains many verses on the Bhagavadgitã and several passages of the Upanisads (All this will be shown in the table below.

<p>The Bșhad-yogiyājñavalkya absorbs without acknowled gement Vedic, particularly Upanişad passages. For example, it cites (XI. 7) Rg. I. 164. 39 (Rco akşare&hellip;.samāsate ). In IX. 158 it names the Chandogya, Bșhadāraṇyaka and Taittirīya Upanisads by name. A few examples may be cited. B. II. 37-38 are Katha Up. (2. 15-16), B. II. 42 is Chān. Up. II. 23. 3; B. II. 47 (dve brahmanī &amp;c. ) is Maitri Up. VI. 22; B. II. 53-55 are respectively Tai. Up.

<p>The Bệhadyogiyājñavalkya contains about 930 verses, the Yogayājsavalkya published by Mr. Divanji contains 496 verses and the Trivandrum edition of Yogayājñavalkya con tains about 465 verses. Therefore, the Yogayājñavalkya is in extent about half of the text of the Brhadyogi-yājñavalkya. The references here are made to Mr. Divanji&rsquo;s edition of Yoga yājñavalkya (and not to the T. S. S. edition). The Yogayājña valkya professes that in an assembly of sages (15 are named in XI.13-14 including Vasistha and Viśvāmitra ) both Maitreyi and Gārgi were present and the latter (Gärgi) fell at the feet of the sage and implored him to expound to her the principles of Yoga (1.8). The great sage promises to tell her the essence of Yoga with its angas, which was declared to him by Brahmā himself (1.10-15). He dilates on two paths, one stimulating (pravartaka ) a person to do acts laid down for varnas and asramus and the other called nivartaka ( which prevents rebirth ); he dilates on the four āśramas for Brāhmaṇa, three for Ksatriya, two for Vaisyas and one for Sūdras and Brahmā directed Yājñavalkya to follow the paths of Jñāna and Karma (I. 39-40). The text (I. 43 ) tells us that Gārgi was his wife (bhāryayā tvevamuktastu Yuna valkyas-taponidhiḥ ). In IV. 5 also Gārgi is calleduynjak valkya&rsquo;s wife, in IV. 40 she is addressed by Yājnayake ya as priye&rsquo; and Varārohe (VI. 79, VII. 22 and 34 The</p>

<p>instruction imparted by Brahmā ends with the words in I. 39-40 as quoted below. Jñana consists of Yoga, which has eight angas and Yoga means the union of the Individual soul with the Supreme Soul ( I. 44). The principal topics are: the eight angas, Yama &amp;c.; ten Yamas (I. 50-51 ) and verses 1-19 their definitions ; II (chapter ) - ten niyamas and their definitions ; III the eight recommended āsanas (physical postures ); IV. on Nādi-áuddhi; on Susumņā, the best nadi (IV. 28 ); names of the 14 chief nādī8 (IV. 26-28); ten váyus that circulate in the nādīs, the five chief being Prāna, Apāna, Samāna, vdāna and Vyāna (IV. 47-48) and their spheres ; V. on means of Nādi-áuddhi and appropriate place and actions for securing it; Tantras are specially men tioned in V. 10; signs of having secured Nādi-buddhi ; VI. ( longest chapter of the work ) on Prāņāyāma ; three aspects of prāņāyāma viz. recuku, pūraku and kumbhala ( VI. 2); explanations of these, results of practising these, such as removing diseases; VII. definition of pratyāhāra (1-2); VIII. on Dhāranā; definition of Dhāranī, verbal close resem blances between the contents of the Yogayājsavalkya and the Hathayoga-pradipika. The proper name of this last work is Hathapradipikā ( vide H. of Dh Vol. V. p. 1427, n. 2344 ). This is a late work and mentions 35 siddhus such as Matsyendranātha, Gorakşanātha, Galininātha, Nivịttinātha, and Jñanadeva, who wrote his famous commentary on the Gītā in 1290 A. D, and mentioned these as in the line of gurus before him. Vide H. of Dh. Vol. V. p. 1429.</p>
<p>There are great defects in the arguments of Mr. Divanji in favour of the work sponsored by him being the Yogaśāstra referred to by Yājñavalkya (in Yāj. Smrti III. 110 ) as com posed by him before the Smộti itself. Both works (the Bșhadyogiyājñavalkya Smrti and the Yogayājñavalkya) claim that they contain what Yāj., a famous and very ancient sage, contemporary of ancient king Janaka (in the case of the Bộ. Yogi-Yājžiavalkya and also the recipient of Yajus from the Sun) and an ancient sage Yājña valkya whose wife was Gārgi and who received the Yogic knowledge from God Brahmå himself (in the case of the Yoga-Yājsavalkya ). Pent these days hardly any critical reader would admit these claims of both works. But the case of the author the Yoga-Yāiñavalkya is much worse. This latter would be further charged either with being ignorant of aucient History</p>

<p>History of Dharmaśāstra</p>
<p>and legends or with ignoring the Upanisad story and foisting a totally new one on Yājñavalkya. In the Br. Upanigad (II.4-5) it is said that Yāj. had two wives Maitreyi and Kātyāyanī, the former wanted no wealth but was eager only to learn the means for securing immortality and then Yāj. expounded to her Brahma-vidyā. In Bỉ. Up. III-1 it is said that Janaka offered to donate a thousand cows to that one among the persons assembled who was the best knower of brahman. Yāj. asked his pupil Sāmasravas to take away the cows. Then Asvala, Janaka&rsquo;s hotr priest, and others viz. Artabhāga, Bhujyu, Usasta, Kahol&amp; asked him questions, which Yâj. answered and silenced them. Then Gärgi Vācak navi asked him (in Br. Up. III.6) several questions one after another and lastly asked &lsquo;kasmin nu Brahmaloka otāśca protāsca&rsquo;. Yāj. said to her' do not carry your question ing to the utmost limit, otherwise your head would fall down' (i. e. you will meet death). She remained silent. In the Yoga yājñavalkya ( ed. by Divanji ) she is put forward as Yājña valkya&rsquo;s wife, a pure invention by the author of that work for the sake of palming it off as a very authoritative work.</p>
<p>Mr. Divanji on p. 25 of his paper in ABORI Vol. 34 on the two works ( having Yājña valkya as part of their names) tries to make light of this circumstance by saying that a rose would smell as sweet even if called by some other name. This is trying to dodge the real issue, which is whether the work edited by him is that of the Yājñavalkya of the Bỉ. Up. or is the work of the author of the Yāj. Smrti. The present author would have no quarrel with him if he admits that it is not a work of the ancient sage Yājñavalkya but of some one who suppresses his real name and the present author would admit that the work he edited is on Hathayoga (but not by the author of Yāj. Smști). On p. 29 he writes' the author had not forgotten the fact&hellip;but had meant to speak about another Yājňavalkya&rsquo;in I.6). One fails to understand what he means. The word Vadhūḥ being in the singular would go with the nearest word Maitreyi and not with both Maitreyi and Gārgi. The work, being a small one, deals only with Hathayoga, it does not dilate upon the daily religious rites to be performed, but harps constantly on the point that actions prescribed by Sāstric texts must be performed even by an adept for Hathayoga ( vide VI.79 nityam karına má caret,' XI. 7 &lsquo;Vidhyuktam karma karta vyam brahmavidblica</p>

<p>nityasaḥ) and the author says that Gārgi was advised by Yājñavalkya (in X1.9 ) &lsquo;tasmād-ā maraņād-vaidham kartav yam yogibhiḥ sadā tvam caiva mātyāya Gārgi vaidham karma samācara il&rsquo;.</p>
<p>As regards the Brhadyogi-Yājñavalkya matters stand as follows. Vācaspatimisra in his commentary on the Yoga bhāsya quotes a half verse from the Yogiyājsavalkya-Smrti viz. ·Hiraṇyagarbho yogasya vaktā nānyaḥ purātanah&rsquo;, which occurs in the Brhad-Yogio (in Lonavala edition ) as X11.5, and not in Yogayājñavalkya ( ed. by Mr. Diwanji ). Vācas pati wrote learned works on several sāstras. His Nyāya sūcinibandha was composed in Vatsara 898 i. e. 841-41 A. D. (or even if the figures be taken as referring to Saka era before 976 A.D.). Therefore, the Bșhad-Yogi-Yāj. would have to be placed at any rate before 800 A. D. or at least before 950 A. D. Prof. Keith in &lsquo;Indian Logic and Atomism&rsquo; Oxford, 1921 ) pre fers 841 A. D. as the proper date (pp. 29-30 ) for Vācaspati. Aparārka in his voluminous commentary (on Yaj. ) mentions Yogayājñavalkya (Lonavala edition ) at least 25 times and quotes about 65 verses from it.</p>
<p>There are some special features in the Br. Yogi-Yāj. Most early and mediaeval works on Yoga do not dilate upon the prescribed daily duties ( such as bath, sandhyā, sūryo pasthāna ), while this work attaches importance to them and dilates upon them. Another outstanding feature is that it upholds the view called &lsquo;Iñánakarmasamuccaya.&rsquo; One reaches the Highest Self by the union of knowledge and actions ; one would not secure perfection by treating the two as distinct from one another, therefore one should have recourse to both. Jñāna is predominant but not so when bereft of actions ; activity (actions ) is predominant, but not when devoid of knowledge. Therefore, perfection results from both only, just as a bird cannot fly on one wing. ( To hold ) that moksa ( re leage from bondage ) follows from knowledge is a sign of indolence. Unwise people desire no activities for fear of trouble to the body” ( B. Y. Y. IX. 28, 29, 34). Another noteworthy matter is that the Br. Y. Y. arranges the list of the eight angas of yoga as pratyāhāra, dbyāna and dhāraud and departs from the order stated in Yogasūtra II.28. The Br. Y. Y. holds that even a householder by performing the prescribed duties, by thoroughly understanding the nature of Ātman and by the thorough knowledge of Vedānta pa sta ges secures molsa.</p>

<p>History of Dharmaśāstra</p>
<p>The Brahmacāri-kāņda and Mokşa-kānda of the Kalpa taru (about 1125–1150 A. D.) quote respectively about sixteen and ten verses from Yogiyājñavalkya. A well-known verse about the meaning of rnātră in prānāyāma has been quoted in vol. V. (of the H. of Dh.) p. 1438 n. 2361 from the Yogi-Yāj. which is Br. Y. Y. VIII.12. An interesting passage from the Brahmacãrikānda of the Kalpataru is quoted in the foot-note which shows that the work was known as Yogi Yājñavalkya to the Kalpataru. 490</p>
<p>The Yoga-Yājñavalkya edited by Mr. Divanji is like an elementary treatise or handbook chiefly on Hathayoga of less than 500 verses. It is not possible to agree with Mr. Divanji that it was the Yogaśāstra referred to by Yājñavalkya-Sinști (II1.110 ) as already composed by him before the Yāj.Smộti. One circumstance against it (in putting forward Gärgi as the wife of the sage Yājñāvalkya ) has already been stated above. Moreover, it differs from the Yājñavalk yasmộti on some im portant matters. Some differences may be mentioned here. Yāj. enumerates ten Yamas and ten Niyamas (in II1.312-13). In Yoga-Yaj. also the number of both is the same (1.50-51 for yamas and 11.1-2 for niyamas ). But the details differ in both. Seven Yamas are the same in both viz. Brahmacarya, dayā, ksanti, satya, akalkatā (i. e. ärjava ), ahimsã and asteya. Dāna is a yama in Yāj ; but a niyama in Yogi-Yāj. Most niyamas are different. Both these works differ a good deal from the Yogasūtra 11.30 and 32 in the number of Yamas and Niyamas and their names.</p>
<p>Yāj. 1.10 states that Brāhmaṇas, Ksatriyas and Vaisyas are dvijas and all rites for them from Garbhādhāna to Ant yesti are to be performed with Vedic mantras. So a Vaisya could take to the order of forest hermits if he chose to do so. But the Yoga-Yāj. (11.30 and 35 ) expressly states that Ksatriya can resort to three ägramas ( i. e. he cannot become a Sanyasin).</p>
<p>It may be noted that Sridatta ( about 1275–1310 A. D.) quotes from Yogi-Yājsavalkya about 15 verses in his small work called Chandogāhnika (only 63 pages in Nir. edition,</p>

<p>1930), all of which occur in Bș. Y Y; as on p. 9 ( 4 verses = Br. Y. Y. VII. 162-165 ); Br. Y. Y. VII. p. 10-12; Br. Y. Y. 167 and VII. 119, p. 13 ( 2 verses Br. Y. Y. VII. 36, 158 ), p. 17 ( Br. Y. Y. VIII 47, Sridatta setting aside several views on Prānāyāma of others on account of this verse ), p. 19 (one verse=Br. Y. Y. VI. 25 ) p. 25 (2 verses =Br. Y. Y. IV 27-28 ), p. 27 (one verse Br. Y. Y. I. 28 ), p. 27 (2 verses Br. Y. Y. X. 13, 15), p. 44 (one verse Br. Y. Y. VII. 98 ).</p>
<p>Mr. Divanji has not been able to show that these nume rous quotations from medieval exhaustive works such as Aparārka&rsquo;s commentary, the Kalpataru on Brahmacārī and Moksa Kāndas and the Dānasāgara occur in the work edited by him.</p>
<p>Even some learned and comparatively early commenta tors quote portions from the Yāj. Smrti as from Yogi-Yaj. For example, Kullūka on Manu III.1 ( laying down various periods of time for Vedic studies ) quotes Yāj. I.36 as Yogi Yājñavalkya “ Yadāha Yogi-Yājňavalkyaḥ-Prativedam brah macaryam dvādas@bdāni pañca vũ.” .</p>
<p>From the above it is clear that Yoga-Yājñavalkya and Bșhad-Yogi-Yājñavalkya are entirely different works and that the latter is comparatively an early work, as quotations from it are cited by Vācaspatimisra ( 9th century ) and Apa rärka.</p>
<p>The Brhad-Yogi-Yājñavalkya contains numerous quote tions from the Manusmrti and the Bhagavadgitā and a few from the Yāj. Smrti itself: Yāj. Smrti I. 3 is the same as Bệbad-Yogi Yāj. XII. 3 ( which latter substitutes the word &lsquo;tarka&rsquo; for nyāya )'. Therefore the Bșhad-Yogi-Yājña valkya may be placed between 300 to 700 A. D.</p>
<p>There were probably many commentaries on the Yāj. Smrti. Out of these those of Visvarūpa, Vijñānesvara, Apa rārka, Sūlapāni and Mitramisra are the most famous. For these, vide sections 60, 70, 79, 95, 108 below. It has been shown above that Visvarūpa bad before him some commen tary or commentaries on Yāj. not now extant. For these see sections 60, 70, 79 and 95 below. On account of the para mount importance of the Mit. in modern Hindu Law administered by British Courts in the whole of India, the smộti of Yāj. has indirectly become the guiding work for De whole of India and this position it richly deserves by it is concise but clear statement of principles, its breadth of vision</p>
<p>POO</p>
<p>458</p>
<p>History of Dharmaśāstra</p>
<p>S</p>
<p>and its comparative impartiality towards the claims of both sexes and the different varņas.</p>
<p>Visvarüpa on Yāj. I. 4-5 quotes two verses of Vrddha Yājñavalkya (vide note below). The Mit. on Yāj. 111. 1-2 quotes one verse of Vrddha-Yāj. and two verses of Vụddha Yāj. on III.19. Further, it quotes a verse and a half as from both Vệddha-Yaj. and Chāgaleya on the after-death rites for those who kill themselves in circumstances in which the śāstras do not permit suicide, wherein the view of Yama is mentioned. The view of Brhad-Yāj. on there being uo prohi bition against Ksatriyas and Vaisyas drinking mudya ( but only against sură) has been cited above. Aparārka quotes Vrddha-Yāj. ten times.</p>
<p>Mr. Divanji relies on quotations in the Bhāsya attributed to Sankarācārya on the Svetāśvatara-upanişad. In A BORI Vol. 34 p. 23, Mr. Divanji admits that scholars question the claims of that Bhāsyakāra to be the famous Sarkarācārya, but argues that, even if a successor of the original Sankarā cārya quotes them as Yogayājñavalkya, then that is positive proof that some verses of Yogayājñavalkya are quoted by some writer. But there is a snag in this argument. The Bhāṣyakāra ( whoever he may be ) of the Sv. Up. quotes the Yāj. Smrti as Yājñavalkya (as on p. 5 Yāj. III. 62, 141 and 156-59 ) and as Bhagavan Yāj. ( verse III, 144 ) on Sv. Up. 1.7 p. 29. The same Bhāsyakāra quotes on Sv. Up. 1.7 ( p. 28 ) four verses as those of Yogiyājñavalkya. This shows that the Bhäsyakára of Sv. Up. regards the two as different. Mr. Divanji fails to show that these verses occur in the Yoga Yājñavalkya (that he edits). Mr. Divanji failed to recognize that Yāj. Smrti (III. 144) was quoted as that of Bhagavān Yáj. Again on the same page 23 ( of ABORI vol. 34 ) he remarks that out of 9 verses quoted on Sv. Up. I. 29 of the Bhāsya, 18 could be found with slight variations in the Yoga-Yăjo. There is a serious mistake here. The verses are not cited expressly as from Yogayāj. as the Bhāsya expressly cites four verses on Sv. Up. 17 as from Yogi-Yāj. The Rhāsya does not introduce them as from Yoga-Yāj. and therefore it is quite likely that those 29 verses occurred in some other work on Yogn from which the Bhāsyakāra (on Sv. Up. II. 9 ) quoted and from which the Yoga-Yāj. copied some for its own purpose. Mr. Divanji&rsquo;s conclusion is vitiated by this serious mistake that</p>
<p>D</p>
<ol start="34">
<li>The Yājnavalkyusmrti</li>
</ol>
<p>IL IT</p>
<p>459</p>
<p>he commits. Eighteen whole verses out of 29 quoted on p. 9 are not found but mostly half verses are quoted which occur in Yoyayājňavalkya edited by Mr. Divanji. Granting for argument that 18 out of 29 are found in Yogayājñavalkya whence do the other eleven come? The only possible conclu. sion is that all 29 are from one work, from which the present Yoga-Yāj. borrows its verses. There is another slip on Mr. Divanji&rsquo;s part. These 29 verses are quoted in Bhāsya on Sv. Up. II. 9 and not on I. I. Besides, one of the 29 verses is &lsquo;Prānāyāmair duhed-dosan &amp;c.&rsquo; which is Manu VI. 7 and occurs also in Br. Y. Y. VIII. 32.</p>
<p>Mr. Divanji&rsquo;s mentality is rather peculiar. On p. 113 of JBBRAS vol. 29, Mr. Divunji gives a list of eight items on quotations from and references to this work (i. e. to Yogayājñavalkya that be edits ) in other works. The first item (Sänkara-bhüşya on Sv. Up.) has been dealt with already. The third reference is to Sarvadarśanasangraha of Madhavă. cārya ( a work of the 14th century A. D.). That work, he says, contains four quotations of the work he edits. That work also quotes Brhad- Yoga - Yājñavalkya on p. 143 *Hirunyagarbho Yogasya &amp;c. ( which is Br. Y. Y. XII.5). The 8th item ( and the last) on that page is above all, the author of the Yajnavalkya-Sinrti has in III. 110 referred to a &lsquo;Yoga sāstra promulgated by me,&rsquo; which can be none other than this (and refers to his own Introduction on p. 8). This is an extraordinary argument. He was a high judicial officer in the days of the British rule. He has written profusely on this one work but with great regret the present author has to say he has not kept an open and judicial mind. He assum es as indisputable what has to be proved to the satisfaction of the scholarly world. The uther items that he puts forward on p. 113 above cited are worth little.</p>

<p>But it is doubtful whether we possess the ancient smộti of Parāśara. The extant smrti is probably a recast of it as it mentions Yāj. in the first chap. (p. 2 ). The Garudapurnya in chap. 107 gives a summary (in 39 verses ) of the Parāśara smrti. In doing so it takes parts of the latter and pieces them together. For example, verses 2-4 in the Garudapurāụa (chap. 107 ) are' srutiḥ smrtiḥ sadācāro yah kaścid vedakar třkah | vedāḥ smitāļ brahmañãılau dharmā Manvādibhiḥ sadā Il dânam kaliyuge dharmaḥ kartāram ca kalau tyajet i pā pakrtyam tu tatraiva sāpam phalati varsataḥ Il ācārāt prāpnuyāt sarvam sat karmūni dine dine i sandhyā snānam japo homo devātithyādipūjanam li' These are taken verbatim or with slight changes from the Parāśara-smrti; compare:&lsquo;na kaścid veda kartă ca vedasmartă caturmukhaḥ i srutiḥ smrtiḥ sadācārā nirnetavyāśca sarvadā i tathaiva dharmam smarati Manuḥ kalpāntarāntare 1 tapaḥ paraṁ&hellip; dānamekaṁ kalau yuge l&hellip; tyajet-deśam kştayuge&hellip; kartāram ca kalau yuge I&hellip;krte tū tatkšanāt sāpaḥ&hellip; kalau samvatsarena tu ll chap. I. verses 20, 21&ndash;23, 25, 27 and vide 39 for verse 4 of the Garuda-purāna. This eastablishes that the Garudapurāna regarded the Parāśara-smrti authoritative and ancient. There is another problem to be considered. Kautilya mentions six times the views of Paräsara or the Pārāśaras on various aspects of politics and state administration.</p>
<p>The Arthasāstra mentions the views of the Pārāśaras (School following Parāśara&rsquo;s views ) in I. 8. 7, I. 15. 23, I. 17. 9, II. 7. 12, VIII. 1. 24, VIII. 3. 30 ( of Prof. Kangle&rsquo;s edition). Therefore, it appears that there was a work of Pårāśara on politics, in which it is possible that vyavahāra also was dealt with.</p>
<p>The extant Parāśarasmrti is divided into twelve chapters and contains according to the last verse but only 592 verses. It deals only with ācāra and prayascitta. Mādhava intro duced his disquisition on vyuvahürı, which forms about a fourth of his extensive gloss, in an indirect way by regarding vyavahāra as a part of the duties of Ksatriyas on which the Parāsarasmộti has something to say.491</p>

<p>The name Parāśara is an ancient one. In æg. VII. 18. 21 Parāśara is mentioned as a grandson of Vasistha Pra ye grhadamamadus-tvāyā Parāsarah-Satayātur-Vasişthah.&rsquo; The plural &lsquo;ye&rsquo; in the verse requires that Satayātuḥ&rsquo; is an individual&rsquo;s designation (literally meaning either one who possessed hundred magic tricks or one against whom one hundred magic tricks were practised ). In the Tai. Aranyaka ( I. 1. 3. 37 ) we have a Vyāsa Pārāsarya. In the Vamba that occurs in the Bşhudāranyaka II. 6.2 and IV. 6. 3 we have a Pārāśarya. The Nirukta gives an etymology of Pārābara. 492 Pāṇini attributes a bhiksusūtra to Pārāśarya.s$3 &lsquo;In the Sāntiparva ( Chapters 290-298 ) there is a lengthy dialogue between Parāśara and king Janaka.</p>
<p>The introductory verses of the smrti say that sages went to Vyäsa and requested him to instruct them in the dharmas and conduct beneficial to mankind in the Kali age and that the great Vyāsa took them to his father Parāśara, son of Sakti, in the Badarikāśrama, who then propounded the dharmas of the four varnos. The first chapter recites the smộtis then known ( 19 in all) and lays down that in the four ages of Krta, Tretā, Dvāpara, and Kali, the dharmas pro claimed by Manu, Gautama, Sarkha-Likhita and Parāśara were respectively to be the guiding ones. The following are briefly the contents of the Parāśarasınști :</p>
<p>I. Introductory verses ; Pärāsara imparts to the sages knowledge of dharma ; the dharmas of the four yugas ; diffe rentiation of the four yugas from various points of view; six daily duties, viz. sandhyā, bath, jupa, homa, Vedic study, worship of yods, Vaisvadeva and honouring guests, eulogy of honouring guests, the proper means of livelihood for Ksatriya, Vaisya and Sūdra ; II. duties of householder; agriculture ; the five unconscious acts of injury to animal life; III. purifi. cation from impurity due to birth and death; IV. concerning suicide; punishment for wife deserting her husband though poor, foolish or diseased ; definition and rules about Kuụda, Golaka, Parivitti, and Parivitta; remarriage of women; re wards for chaste widows ; V. expiation for minor things (suoti as dog-bite ); about a Brāhmaṇa who has consecrated fiber</p>

<p>dying on a journey or committing suicide ; VI. Expiation for killing various beasts and birds, for killing Sūdras, artisans, women, Vaisyas, Ksatriyas, sinful Brāhmanas; eulogy of Brāhmanas; VII. purifications of various articles ( such as vessels of wood, metal &amp;c); about a woman in her menses ; VIII. Expiations for killing cows and oxen unwittingly in various ways; approaching a parişad for expiation, constitu tion of a parisud; praise of learned brāhmaṇas; IX. proper thickness of sticks for beating cows and bulls; expintions for using thicker sticks and injuries to them; X, other expia tions such as cândrāyana for intercourse with women with whom intercourse is forbidden; the expiation called Sānta pana; XI. expiation for partaking food from Cāndālas &amp;c. ; rules as to whose food may be taken and whose not; purifica tion of wells &amp;c. when animals fall in them; XII. bath prescribed after evil dreams, vomitting, shaving &amp;c.; expia tions for drinking wine and nasty things through ignorance ; five kinds of bath; when bath at night allowed; what things should always be kept in the house or seen ; definition of the unit of ground called yocurma ; expiations for the deadly sins of brahmahatyā, drinking liquor, theft of gold &amp;c.</p>
<p>Parāśara contains several peculiar views. He speaks of only four sons (aurasu, kşetraja, datta and křtrima ) though he does not expressly negative a larger number (chap. 4 p. 14). He eulogises the practice of Satī (last two verses of chap. 4). The well-known verse of Nārada ( Stripumsa-yoga 97) &ldquo;naste mộte &amp;c. ” is read at the end as “patir-anyo na vidyate&rsquo; (p. 15). There are a few verses in the Indravajrā metre (e. g. on pp. 11-12 and 36). The Paräśarasmrti quotes the views of several writers on dharma. Munu is frequently cited in the words “Manur-abravid.” In the 7th chapter alone those words occur four times.484 None of them corres ponds exactly with any verse of the Manusmști. Yet Manu V. 133 may be compared with the first two. Besides these, in the 9th chapter Manu&rsquo;s view is quoted that on killing an ani mal tbe guilty party should restore a siinilar one to the owner</p>

<p>or its price. 495 In the 10th he says that according to Manu uncooked food, milk or oil brought from a sūdra&rsquo;s house and used in cooking in a Brāhmana&rsquo;s house could be eaten by a Brāhmana. This is similar to Manu IV. 223.406 In the 12th chapter Parāśara cites the view of Manu that a Brāhmana fed on food (cooked) from sūdras would become a vulture for twelve births, a pig for ten and a dog for seven. There is nothing corresponding to this in Manu. In the 9th chap. Manu is spoken of as one who knows all śāstras.497 The first verse of the 6th chapter says that Manu deals at length with expia. tion for killing animals.498 This is probably a reference to Manu XI. 131-141. Numerous verses in the Parāśara-smrti are word for word the same as those of the Manusmrti. For example, Manu I. 85-86 occur in the first chapter of Parăsara, Manu V. 160 ( about a widow remaining chaste ) occurs with slight variations in the 4th ; Manu XII. 114-115 ( about pari sad ) occur in the 8th chap. (p. 29); Manu XI. 212 ( about the definition of Säntapana ) is the same as Parāśara ( 10th chap. p. 40). Several verses are common to Baudhāyana and Parāģara, e. g. Baud. Dh. S. I. 1, 8, 11, 14 occur in the eighth chapter of Parāśara (pp. 29, 30). The verse &ldquo;na Dārikelair na ca sāna bālair&rdquo; occurring in Parāśara ( 9th chap. p. 35 ) is quoted as Vasistha&rsquo;s by Haradatta on Gautama (22. 18). Parāśara is mentioned by name several times (chap. 111.2,p.8, chap. VI. I. p. 18 and p. 23, chap. VII. 1. p. 24, chap. X. 12. p. 38). Usanas is cited on p. 49 (chap. 12), Prajāpati (in IV. 3. p. 13), Sarkha (chap. 4 p. 15). Veda, Vedāngas, dharmaśāstras and smộtis are spoken of on p. 23 ( 6th chap. ). In the 11th chap. Parāśara refers to several Vedic mantras, inost of which occur in the Rgveda, but two of them, &quot; tejosi śukram&rdquo; and &quot; devasya tvā&rdquo; are not found in the Rgveda. but in the Vāj. S. (22, 1 and 1. 24 respectively ). Parāśara</p>

<p>appears to have been a practical man. He exhorts his readers to save their bodies first in invasions, journeys, diseases, calamities and then care for dharma. He recommends the non-observance of rules of purity in times of difficulty and adherence to the strict rules of dharma when one is at ease. 499</p>
<p>The Mit., A parārka, Smộticandrikā, Hemādri and other later works quote Parāśara very frequently. Most of these are found in the extant Parāsarasmrti. For example, vide pp. 1169, 1177, 1180, 1191 &amp;c. of Aparārka, all of which are traced in Parāśara pp. 42, 43, 42 and 16 respectively. Viéva rūpa quotes Parāśara several times and these quotations can be verified; e. g. on Yāj. III. 16 the verge “anātham&rdquo; ascrib ed to Parāsara is found in Parāśara chap. III p. 10; on Yāj. III. 257 ten verses are cited by Visvarūpa from Parādara which occur in Parāśara with considerable variations (chap. VII. pp. 20-21 ) ; on Yāj. III. 262 the verse &ldquo;gavām ban dhana&quot;is cited from Parāśara, which is the first verse of the 8th chapter. Therefore, it is quite clear that in the first half of the 9th century the Parāśarasmrti that we have now was considered to be authoritative and the work of an ancient sage. It seems to have known a work of Manu, as seen above. Therefore, it must be assigned to some period between the first and the 5th century of the christian era. In the same direction points the fact that the Garudapurāņa (chap. 107 ) seems to have known the introductory verses of Parāśara and as shown above (p. 191 ) combines passages of Parāśara in a summary of its teachings.600 The Vibnu-dharmottara which is fre quently quoted by Aparārka and other later works cites verses that are borrowed from Parāśara. For example, chap. 75. 1 of the former is the same as a verse of Parāśara.51</p>

<p>Viśvarūpa frequently quotes Parāśara e. g. on Yāj. II. 6 he quotes two verses of Parāśara by name that are Parāśara III. 45 and 47; on Yāj. III. 30 he cites verses of Parāśara viz. III. 5 (ekāhāt &amp;c.), III. 6 (nāmadhārakao), III. 8 Ubhaya tra &amp;c.), III. 26 (Samparkesu &amp;c. ), on Yāj. III. 250 (Patat yardham &amp;c. Parāśara X. p. 40). Medhătithi on Manu V. 89 states that in the case of those who perform after-death religious rites for those who commit suicide Parāśara prescribes Taptakrcchra penance. The Mitākṣarā quotes about twenty-five verses on Yāj. III from Parāśara e g. on Yāj. III. 250, 41, on Yāj. III. 261 and 6) verses, on Yāj. III. 263-64. Aparūrka also quotes a few verses on ācāra (about 9) and about 90 on Yāj. III. Aparărka on Yăj. III. 318 quotes a verse from Parāśara about the number of morsels to be eaten on ekabhakta and other observances and immediately afterwards quotes a verse of Vrddha-Parăśara which differs from Parāśara. The Smrti-candrika (on ūhnika pp. 94-95) quotes two verses from Vrddhaparāśara.</p>
<p>It is to be noted that Aparārka (p. 1061 on Yāj. III. 250 ) quotes three verses from the Bbavisyatpurāna which mention that a brāhmana who kills another brāhmana (not learned in the Veda ) may perform the penance declared by Parāśara and cites ten verses from Paräsara-smrti of which most are found in the printed Parāśara XII Jivānanda pp. 50-51 ) though not all.</p>
<p>There is an extensive work called Bșhat-Parāśara-san hită ( published by Jivananda, part II. pp. 53-309). It is divided into 12 chapters and the last verse says that it con tains 3300 verses and that Suvrata proclaimed the sāstra imparted by Parāśara. The introductory verses contain the same story as that in the Parāśara-smrti and many of the verses in the first chapter of the two works ( such as those about the 19 writers on dharma &amp;c.) are almost the same in both. The total of verses in the printed work comes to about 3000 and not 3300. It appears that the work is a recast of the Parāśarasmộti made by Suvrata. The subjects of the twelve chapters are :- 1. Introductory, the proper sphere of Aryas ; summary of contents; II. Disquisition on the 6 daily karmans, sandhyā, bath, japa, worship of gods, Vaišvadeva in honouring guests ; Gāyatrí; the dharmas of the Varnas; duties and manners of a householder; agriculture, honour toe COWB; IV. forms of marriage; duties of wives ; Jātakarma ant</p>

<p>This Bșhat-Parāsara contains a considerable number of verses mostly in the Indravajrā metre and a few in the Vasantatilakā (e. g. p. 134 ).</p>
<p>The Bșhat-Parāśara appears to be a late work. It is a recast of the Parāsara-smrti. It contains the Vināyakaśānti es elaborated by Yājñavalkya, since it speaks of only one Vināyaka (9th chap. p. 247 ) and not of four as in M. Gr. S. On p. 249 it quotes Yāj. I. 285 ( about the names of Vināyaka ) with the readings found in the Mit. It speaks of the rāģis (P. 244 ). It is not quoted by Visvarūpa, the Mit. or Aparārka. It is mentioned in Bhattoji&rsquo;s comment on the Caturviņgati mata (p. 138 ) and by Nandapandita in the Dattakamīmāṁsā, which quotes a verse (Bphat-Parāśara p. 153 ).802</p>
<p>A Vrddha&ndash;Parāśara is quoted by Aparārka (on Yāj. III. 318 ) immediately after Parāśara and as holding a different view.808 Madhava also quotes a Vrddha-Parāśara ( Parāśara Mādhaviya vol. I, part I, p. 230 ). This seems to be a different work from the Parāśara-smrti and the Bșhat-Parāsara. Hemādri ( Carturvargao vol. III, part 2, p. 48 ) and Bhattoji in his gloss on Caturvimsatimata (p. 138 ) quote a Jyotiḥ Paräsara.</p>

<p>There are two versions of Nárada on Vyavahāra, a smaller and a larger one. The smaller version was translated by Dr. Jolly in 1876 (Trübner &amp; Co., London ). The text of the longer version was published by the same scholar in the Bib liotheca Indica series (1885 ) and was translated by him in the Sacred Books of the East Series ( vol. 33). The edition of the text is accompanied up to verse 21 of the 5th title abhyu petyāśusrūsā' by extracts from the commentary of Asabāya as revised by Kalyāṇabhattu, who was encouraged in the task of revision by Kesavabhatta.</p>
<p>From verse 22 of the same title the printed text is the same as the smaller version. A verse quoted as Nārada&rsquo;s by Ksirasvāmin is not found in the larger version but is found in the smaller version.604 An ancient Ms. of Nārada from Nepal dated 1407 A. D. contains two additional chapters on theft and ordeals. Dr. Jolly includes the first as an appendix and omits that on ordeals on the ground that it is not authentic. One of the colophons of the Nepalese Ms. describes it as &lsquo;iti Mānave-dharmasastre Nāradaproktāyāṁ samhitāyām &amp;c.&rsquo; This corroborates what was said above (pp. 149, 156 ) as to the close connection between Manu and Närada.</p>
<p>Nārada is not mentioned by Yājñavalkya in the list of ancient writers on dharma, nor does Parāśara mention him. Visvarūpa, however, quotes a verse of Vrddha-Yājñavalkya (on Yāj. I. 4-5), where Närada is the first among ten ex pounders of dharma enumerated therein. &lsquo;Nārada is a very ancient name. The Manusmrti ( I. 35 ) mentions Nārada as one of the ten primeval Prajápatis. In the Mahābhārata sage Närada figures frequently. In Udyoga parva ( 49. 22 ) he is said to have told the Vronis to do their duties ( tasmāt-kar maiva karta vyam-iti hováca Nāradaḥ I etad-hi sarvamācasta Vņšņicakrasya vedavit). Sānti ( 30.6 ) says that Närada was the maternal uncle of Parvata. In Sāntiparva 29. 13 ff it is stated that Nārada comforted Yudhisthira on the death of his many relatives and warriors by dilating upon the stories of sixteen ancient kings and heroes who had also similar</p>

<p>sorrows. In Salyaparva, Närada is said to have informed Balarama that his two disciples Bhima and Duryodhana were going to fight with maces. There Nārada is described as holding a fine Vīnā as an expert in dance and song and as stirring up feuds and always fond of quarrels (prakarta kalahānăm ca nityam ca kalaha priyah) in chap. 54. 18-20. According to the Mahābhāsya on Vārtika 15 on Pāṇ. (VIII. 1. 15, Kielhorn ed. III. p. 371), Nārada and Parvata may be spoken of as &lsquo;dvandvam Nārada parvatau as they are a famous pair that is &lsquo;atyantasahacarita&rsquo; (not even Yudhisthira and Arjuna are so ).</p>
<p>The printed Nārada contains three introductory chapters on the principles of judical procedure ( Vyavahāra-mātņkā ) and on the judicial assembly ( sabhā ). Then the following titles of law are dealt with one after another :- rņādāna ( recovery of debts ), u panidhi (deposit, lending, bailment ), sambhūya-samutthāna (partnership ), dattāpradānika (gifts and resumption thereof), abhyupetya-asuśrūķā (breach of contract of service ), vetanasya-anapākarma (non-payment of wages), asvāmivikraya ( sale without ownership ), vikrīyā sampradăna (non-delivery after sale ), krītānusaya ( rescis sion of purchase ), samayasyāna pākarma ( violation of conven tions of corporations, guilds &amp;c.); simābandha ( settlement of boundaries ); strīpumsayoga ( marital relation); dāyabhāga ( partition and inheritance ); sāhasāḥ (offences in which force is the principal element), such as homicide, robbery, rape &amp;c.; vākpārusya ( defamation and abuse ) and dundapārusya (hurt of various kinds ); prakirnaka ( miscellaneous wrongs ). The appendix deals with theft ; a few remarks are made on that topic under the title of &lsquo;sāhasa &lsquo;.</p>
<p>It will be noticed that Nārada follows the Manusmrti to a considerable extent in the nomenclature and the arrange ment of the eighteen titles. Some of the titles are differently named by Nārada, e. g. he speaks of upanidhi, while Manu employs the word niksepa. Nārada seems to have included the &lsquo;gvāmipālavivāda&rsquo; of Manu in vetanasya-ana päkarma&rsquo;. He makes one title of dyūta and sumūhvaya. Nārada includes strisamgrahana under sābasa and adds three titles, viz. abhyupetya-asusrūsā, vikrīyāsampradāna and prakiraka. The Smộticandrikā expressly 60s says that it follows the word</p>

<p>The printed Nārada contains 1028 verses (including 61 on theft in the appendix ). About seven hundred of these verses occur in various nibandhas as quotations. Up to the 21st verse of the section &lsquo;abhyuretyāśuśrūşā&rsquo; the commen tary of Asahāya furnishes a valuable check for the authenti city of the text. For the remaining portion, there are important data as to its authenticity, sequence and readings. Visvarūpa, who belongs to the first half of the 9th century, quotes about fifty verses of Narada (generally by name ). The text that he had before him was essentially the same as vuat of the printed edition except in a very few cases. Out of the seven verses of Nirada on samayasya-ana pākarma&rsquo; Visvarūpa quotes five ( on Yāj. II. 190 and 196 ) and expressly states that Nárada wound up his chapter on that topic with the verse dosavat karanam &amp;c.&rsquo; as the printed text does. On Yāj. II. 226 Visvarūpa distinctly says that the verse &lsquo;yameva hyativarteran&rsquo; &amp;c. is followed immediately by &lsquo;malā hyete manusyesu&rsquo;. This is the case with the printed text also (dyūtasa māhvaya, verses 13-14). On Yāj. III.252 Visvarūpa quotes a verse of Nárada about the three kinds of wealth, viz. sukla, sabala and krsna, which does not occur in that form in Nārada, though the latter contains similar dicta.608 Visvarūpa contains no quotation from Nárada on the topics of ācāra or prāyaścitta. The same is the case with Medhà tithi and the Mitāksarā. Medhătithi somewhat inaccurately summarises the introductory words (in prose) of Nārada ( vide note 269 above). Medhătithi frequently quotes Nārada particularly from the sections on rņādāna (vide on Manu 8. 47, 155, 149 ) and dāyabhāga (on Manu 8, 28, 29, and 207, 209 and 143). On Manu 8, 349 he quotes Nārada on partnership (verse 10 ), ou 8. 216 he quotes Nārada ( vetanasya-anapă. karma, verse 5). In some cases Medhātithi cites Nārada&rsquo;s verses without naming him e. g. on Manu 9. 76 he quotes the</p>

<p>well-known verse &lsquo;naste mite pravrajite &amp;c.&rsquo; ( Nārada on marital relation, verse 97 ) as &lsquo;smrtyantara&rsquo;. It was shown above (p. 172 ) that the vyavahāra section of the Agnipurāna dates from about 900 A. D. Chap. 253 of the Agnipurāņa con tains thirty verses of the extant Nāradusmrti, viz. Agni 253. 1b-9a = Nārada ( vyavahāra-mātņkā chap. I. 8-15); Agni 253. 9b-12 = Nārada (vyavabāra-mātņkā chap. I. 26-29a ); Agui 253. 13-30 are the verses defining the eighteen titles from ruādāna to prakīrṇaka contained in Närada and occur in the game order in both. The readings preserved in the Agni purāna deserve some discussion. Agni (253. 3-4 ) reads</p>
<p>dharmaśca vyavabārasca&hellip;uttarah pūrvasādhakah,&rsquo; while Nārada has pūrvabādhakah.&rsquo; Agni reads &ldquo;caritram sam grahe pumsām rājājñāyām tu sādhanam' (253.5), while Nārada has &lsquo;caritram pustakarane räjājñāyām tu sāsanam.&rsquo; Agni ( 253.15 ) reads &lsquo;dattvädra vyam ca samyag-yah,&rsquo; while Nārada (dattāpradānika I) reads &lsquo;dattvä dravyamasamyag yah.&rsquo; The Agni ( 253. 11 ) reads Sarkā sadbhistu saṁsaryåt tattvam soďhābhidarśanāt' and avoids the rare word &lsquo;hod hābhi-&rsquo; in Nārada · Sankāsatām tu saṁsargāt tattvam hodhā bhidarsapát' (Vyavahāramātskā I. 27). For Nārada&rsquo;s &lsquo;ak sabradhnasalākādyair &amp;c.&rsquo; (dyuta samāhvaya I) Agni reads</p>
<p>Aksavajra &amp;c. ' ( 253. 29). The Mit. ( on Yāj. II. 199 ) and Vir. (p. 718 ) follow printed Nārada in the last case and also in the other cases. The Mit. quotes more than 240 verses of Nārada, sometimes in large groups. For example, it quotes over eleven verses in its Introduction to Yáj. II. 182, nine verses more on Yāj. II. 182 itself and seven verses in introdu cing the topic of Sāhasa in Yāj. II. 230. In the Smrti-can drikā, Hemādri, Parāśaramādhaviya and other later niban dhas numerous verses of Nārada are quoted on topics of ācāra Srāddha, prāyascitta. For example, Hemādri (caturvargao, vol. III. part 2, pp. 159, 183, 185, 223, 235 ) quotes several verses of Nárada on Ekādaśī and a verse of Nārada about the astrological yoga called padmaka. The Smộticandrikā (I. pp. 198-199 ) quotes 26 verses on the worship of Nārāyana, the last of which is the well-known verse dhyeyah sadā savitşmandala-madhyavarti &amp;c.' and the same work (on srāddha p. 354 ) quotes a verse of Nārada in wbich Sunday and Samkrānti are mentioned. The question arises whether these quotations of Nārada on ācāra and prāyaścitta amoralli ed topics are the work of the same Närada that wrote on</p>

<p>Vyavahāra. From the fact that early writers like Visvarūpa, Medhătithi and Vijñāneśvara do not contain a single quota tion of Nārada on topics other than that of vyavahāra, it appears probable that the quotations on ācāra and prāyas citta belong to a later date than the Nāradasmrti on vyava hāra and either did not exist in the days of Viúvarūpa and Medhătithi or had not attained canonical authority in those days. There is in the India Office Library a ms. of Nārada smộti in three chapters and 322 verses dealing exclusively with ācāra and prāyaścitta (vide Jolly&rsquo;s Introduction p. 5 to edition of text).</p>
<p>The Nāradasmrti, excluding the introductory passage in prose about the successive abridgments of the original work of Manu by Nārada, Mārkandeya and Sumati Bhārgava, is written in the sloka metre except in the case of two verses (verse 38 of the 2nd chap. of vyavahăra-mātņkā and the last verse of the chapter on sabha). Närada himself is mentioned by name in connection with the ordeals (rạādāna verse 253 ).507 The first person also occurs in &lsquo;ataḥ param prava ksyāmi&rsquo; (ruādāna 343 ). Acāryas are cited in dattāprada nika&rsquo; (verse 5). Dharmaśāstra and Arthaśāstra are mentioned ( vyavahāramātrka, chap. I, 37 and 39) and Narada lays down the rule as in Yāj. (II. 21 ) that in a conflict between the two the former should furnish the rule of conduct.608 Närada refers to Vasistha&rsquo;s rule about interest (ruādāna 99 ). Two verses are quoted from a Purāna.508 Manu is named in several places (rņādāna verses 250, 251, 326 ).610 The first</p>

<p>passage about Manu is quoted by Visvarūpa on Yāj. (II. 98 ) and corresponds closely with the teaching of Manu (8. 113). But the other passages crediting Manu with dividing ordeals into five kinds and giving his view about poison ordeal have no corresponding passage in the extant Manu. Therefore, Nārada had a version of Manu before him that was somewhat different in certain respects from our Manu or Nārada may be referring to Vrddha or Bșhat Manu. Besides this, there is one remarkable fact to be noted about the relation of Manu and Nārada. There are about 50 verses that are common to Manu and Nārada. Manu 8. 12-14 and 18-19 are Nārada (sabhā, verses 8-10 and 12-13 in a different order), Manu 8. 140-141 =N. (rņādāna 99-100), Manu 8. 148-149=N. (rņādāna 80-81), M. 8. 143=N. (mn. 129, M. 8. 64=N. (r. 177 ), M. 8. 72=N. ( ¥. 189 ), M. 8. 93 and 113=N. (r. 199, 201 ), M.98-99 = N(r. 208, 209 and Udyoga parva 35. 33-34 ), M. 8. 89=N. (r. 225 ), M. 8. 186-187, 189 191=N. ( upanidhi 10-13), M. 8. 232-233, 235=N. ( vetanasya-anapäkarma 14-16 in a diffe rent order ), M. 9. 47=N. ( marital relation, verse 28 ), M. 8. 224-225=N. (marital-relation, 33-34), M, 9. 357-353=N. ( marital relation, 65-66 in reverse order ), M. 1.3=N. ( daya bhāga 31 ), M. 9. 216 =N. (dāyabhāga 44), M. 8. 267-269=N. (vākpārusya 15-17 ), M. 9. 270-272=N. ( vāk pārusya 22-24 ), M. 8. 281-284 =N. ( danda-pārusya ( 26-29), M. 4. 87=N (prakirņaka 44 ).</p>
<p>Nārada, mnādāna 158, &lsquo;srotriyās-tāpasā vỉddhā ye ca pravrajitā narāh I asāksinas-te vacanūn nātra heturudāhstah&rsquo; has probably Manu 8.65 in view where we read &lsquo;na sākşi&hellip;na śrotriyo na lingastho na sajigebhyo vinirgataḥ&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Besides these, there are several cases where Nārada closely agrees with Manu though the verses are not identical, e. g. Nārada ( sāhasa 19 ) may be compared with Manu 9. 271 and Nárada ( appendix on theft, verses 1-4 ) may be compared with Manu ( 9. 256-260 ). These facts establish that Nārada is based on a version of Manu that was essentially the same as the extant text of Manu, though there was some difference here and there. Nārada contains several verses that occur in the Mahābhārata. For example, Sānti III. 66=N. (vyavahāra mātņkā 72 ),611 Udyoga 35.58=N. ( sabhā, verse 18 ), Ustega</p>

<p>35.31-32=N. (r. 202&ndash;203). The well-known verse of the Mahă bhārata on the greatness of speaking the truth (Santi, 162.26) occurs in Nārada, verse 211 on p. 104 (SBE Vol. 33 p. 93 ). There are several cases where the text of Kautilya agrees with Nārada.513 In some of these cases the agreement is almost word for word. 613 A half verse on poison-ordeal ( viz. Tvam visa&hellip;vyavasthitah ) is the same in both Yãj. II. 110 and Nārada IV. 325 p. 124 ( SBE. vol. 33 pp. 115-116 ).</p>
<p>Though Nārada is based on Manu, he differs in several essential matters from Manu. We have seen the difference between them in the nomenclature of the titles of law. Manu only casually mentions the ordeals of fire and water ( 8.114 ), while Nārada enumerates five kinds of ordeals, describes them at length and adds two more viz. tandula-bhaksana and taptumāņu (inādina, verses 259-348 ). He allows Niyoga (marital relation, verses 80-88 ), while Manu strongly con demns it. He allows remarriage of women (Nārada, marital relation, 97), while Manu is against it. Manu men tions seven kinds of slaves (8. 415 ), while Närada raises their number to fifteen ( abhyupetyāśusrūšā, verses 26-28 ); Manu condemns gambling outright (9, 221-228 ), while Nārada allows it under state control and as a source of re. venue ; Närada is further far more systematic than Manu and is full of divisions and sub-divisions; for example, he divides property into three kinds, each of which is again subdivided into seven varieties (mnādāna 44-47 ); Nārada divides the law of gifts into four sections, which are further subdivided into 32; he subdivides the eighteen titles into 132 (vyavahāra mātrkā I. 25 ).</p>
<p>There are a few points which are almost peculiar to Nārada such as the fourteen kinds of impotent persons (stri pumsayoga 11-13), the three kinds of punarbhūs and four kinds of svairiņis (ibid. verses 45-52).</p>

<p>Nārada is probably later than Yājñavalkya. Yāj. mentions only five kinds of ordeals, while Nārada knows seven and the former&rsquo;s treatment of them is not so exhaustive as Nārada&rsquo;s. The rules of judicial procedure in Nārada are more systematic and exhaustive than those of Yāj. Nārada is more conservative than Yāj. For example, Nārada nowhere recognises the right of the widow to succeed to her deceased husband. Nārada cites more definitions than Yāj. In some respects, however, Nārada is more reticent than Yāj.; Nārada gives no rules about the succession of gotrajas and bandhus as Yāj. does. In a few res pects Nārada agrees with the views of Manu instead of with</p>
<p>Yāj., such as allowing a brāhmaṇa to marry a sūdra woman. Nārada regards sexual intercourse with a pravrajitā (female ascetic ) as a mortal sin ( strīpuṁsayoga 74-75 ), while both Manu ( 8. 363 ) and Yāj. (II. 293 ) treat it lightly. Taking all these things into consideration it may be said that Nārada flourished nearly at the same time as or somewhat later than Yāj.</p>
<p>It may be noted that in an Inscription from Campā dated about sake 1092 (i. e. 1170 A. D.) a king is described as</p>
<p>versed in all the Dharmaśāstras, notably the Náradiya and Bhargaviya'; vide Dr. R. C. Majumdar&rsquo;s &lsquo;Ancient Indian Colonies&rsquo;, vol. I at end p. 199 No. 81.</p>
<p>Nārada contains several rare words such as &ldquo;hodha&rdquo; (in vyavahāramātřkā 1.27, meaning &lsquo;one&rsquo;s property when lost or stolen&rsquo;). He gives expression to certain principles of law and politics, such as that a man is master of his own house, in other words, a man&rsquo;s house is his castle ; 614 he highly eulo gises the office of the king, almost assigning it a divine origin and exhorts the people to obey and honour even a weak and undeserving king. 616 Mr. Jayasval sees in this and in the fact that Nārada speaks of dināra while the Mrcchakatika speaks of nāņaka indications that Nārada belongs to the fourth cen tury, is later than the drama, is propping up the authority</p>

<p>of a new dynasty and flourished under the Imperial Guptas (C. W. N. vol. 17, p. CCLXXXV). He regards a person as minor till the sixteenth year. 516 This limit was probably first fixed by Nārada. Nārada further boldly says that in case of conflict between dharmaśāstra and usages, the latter have to be followed, as they are directly observed. 517</p>
<p>As Nārada’s is regarded as an authoritative smộti by Vis varūpa, Medhātithi and other later writers and as Asahāya, who is mentioned by name in the commentary of Visvarūpa, wrote a comment on Nārada, the Nāradasmrti must be older by some centurie : than the 8th century, the latest date to which Asahāya can be assigned. Bana in his Kādambari com pares the royal palace to Nāradiya.518 Ordinarily Nāradīya standing by itself would denote the Nāradapurana ( compare Vismu-purāna 3.6. 21 where we have the form Nāradiya for the purāļa ). The Nārada-purana ( Venkatesvara Press edition, Bombay ) contains, however, no treatment of rājadharma. Bāna may have intended a violent pun, meaning the palace where the duties of kings were being expounded (Kvarnya māna ), like the Náradiya in which rājadharma has not been set forth ( avarnyamāna ).' European scholars like Dr. Jolly and Bühler hold that Bāna refers to the extant Nāradasmrti. But on this explanation also the difficulty is not entirely got over. The extant Närada can hardly be described as a treatise on rājadharma. It deals only in an indirect way with one aspect of the king&rsquo;s duties and is rather concerned with vye vahāra and the duties of the subjects towards each other from the strictly legal point of view. If we turn to the Mahabhá rata and other works, we shall find that rājadharma meant something different from what is treated of in the Nārada smrti. Therefore Bana&rsquo;s reference to the Nāradiya is of a doubtful character. The Rājanīti-ratnākara of Candesvara frequently quotes Närada on politics ( pp. 3, 13, 79 ). These quotations are not traced in the printed Nārada. Therefore it is highly probable that Bana refers to a distinct work of Nārada on politics which has not yet been recovered.</p>

<p>:: From the Rājanitiratnākara of Candeśvara published for the BORS of Patna ( 1924 ) by Mr. K. P. Jayaswal it appears that Candeśvara knew a work of Nárada on Rājadharma. On p. 3618 of that work Nārada on Rājaniti is cited for dilating upon three grades of rulers viz. Samrát (an emperor to whom other kings pay tribute ) also called &lsquo;cakravartin&rsquo; and &lsquo;Sakura&rsquo; and akara' rulers. On p. 75 Candeśvara quotes the words of Hārita and Nārada to the effect that a king should trans mit his kingdom to the eldest son after providing for the maintenance of other sons if he has several sons. The Vrddha</p>
<p>Harita-smrtisan in the Anandasrama collection of Smrtis (1905 A. D.) says that Kātyāyana, Manu, Yājñavalkya and Nārada described at length the rājadharmas which he himself dealt with.</p>
<p>21</p>
<p>The Vyavahāramātrkā of Jimūtavāhana and the Parā sara-Madhaviya (vol. III, part I, p. 203 ) quote a verse from Nárada, the latter half of which is the same as the latter half of a verse in the Vikramorvašīya.521 The doctrine attributed to Nārada is found in Yāj. (II. 20 ) and the Visnudharina sutra (6. 22 ) but not in the same words. Unfortunately the date of Kālidāsa is far from being universally accepted, but the fourth or first half of the 5th century is often accepted 48 the probable date. There is further difficulty in the fact that the text of the Vikramorvasiya has been largely tampered with. If the verse is a genuine part of the drama, it seems natural to suppose that Kālidāsa turns a well-known legal maxim to a somewhat bumorous use. It is hard to suppose</p>

<p>that Nārada would borrow the words of a dramatist for sett ing forth a legal maxim. This would push back the date of Nárada far beyond the 5th century. Nārada in two places uses the word “dināra,&rdquo; 522 once in the sense of a golden orna. ment and again as a coin or unit of value also called &ldquo;suvarna.&rdquo; In this last case he says that &ldquo;dināra is equal to 48 kārsā panas or twelve dhānakas.&rdquo; Jolly (R. u. S. p. 23 ) thinks that Indian dināras can scarcely be older than the 2nd century A. D., although in the times of the Indo-Scythian kings coins of the weight of dinära occur. Therefore Jolly is of opinion that Nārada is later than 300 A. D. Winternitz ( History of Indian Literature, vol. II. p. 216 n. 4 ) follows him in this assumption that all Sanskrit works in which the word dināra occurs nust be later than the 2nd or 3rd century A. D. It may be that the golden dināras most numerously found in India belong to the 2nd and 3rd centuries A. D. But as Keith points out (J. R. A. S. 1915 p. 504 ) Jolly&rsquo;s assumption is wrong and the introduction of vinurus into India need not be later than the beginning of the Christian era. Golden dināras were first coined in Rome in 207 B. C. and the oldest Indian pieces corresponding in weight to the Roman Denarius were struck by Indo-Scythian kings who reigned from the first century B. C. (W. B. p. 44). Therefore there is nothing to prevent us from holding that Narada flourished in the first centuries of the Christian era, i, e. between 100 and 300 A. D. Mr. Jayasval assigns him to the 4th century A. D. and after the Mşccha katika. Most scholars would not be prepared to assign to the Mrcchakatika so early a date as the 3rd century A. D. Besides Mr. Jayasval builds his theory on very slend. er foundations. Because the drama employs the word nāņaka and Nārada speaks of dināra only, no chronological conclusion as to the priority of the one to the other can be drawn. After both words became current in the language, one author, though later, may employ one word, while another, though earlier, may employ the other.</p>

<p>was published in 1929 in the Trivandrum Sanskrit Series, edited by K. Sambasiva Sastri (based on four Mes). The work claims to be a version of the Manusmrti by Närada. Prof. T. R. Chintamani contributed a lengthy paper on this version of the Nāradasmști to the Kunhan Raja Presentation volume, published by the Adyar Library, Madras ( in 1946 ) pp. 153-196. He points out that the main differences between the longer and shorter versions of Närada published by Prof, Jolly are these : the shorter text omits the section on thefts, does not cite the verses on ordeals in a separate chapter and omits the chapter on legal procedure. The longer version has 1028 verses including an appendix on thefts (of 61 verses ). The shorter version has 870 verses and the text on which Bhavasvāmin comments has 877 } verses. The edition with Bhavasvāmibhāşya has at the end a chapter on five ordeals dealt with in 46. verses ( the five being Dhata, Agni, Udaka, Visa and Kosa ). There are many variations between the Smrti as published by Dr. Jolly and that published with Bhavasvamin&rsquo;s bhāsya. On pp. 159-193 Prof. Chintamani sets out the numerous ( nearly a thousand ) differences ( small and also large ) in the Smrti as published by Dr. Jolly and as found in the Nāradiya Manusamhitā. And on pp. 193-196 Prof. Chintamani prints the text of the 2nd Appendix (on five ordeals with 46 verses ) in the Nepalese Ms held to be spurious by Jolly and contained in the version of Bhavasvā min after the section called Prakīrṇaka.</p>
<p>The editor of Bhavasvamin&rsquo;s bhāsya surmises (on p. 4 of his English Introduction ) from the fact that all the Mss. of the bhāsya were found only in the Kerala country and the fact that many of the brāhmaṇas that officiate as sacrificial priests in central Kerala bear the name Bhavas vámin, that the bhāsyakāra of Nārada was a brāhmaṇa from Kerala. North India suffered greatly from the ravages of foreign inva sions from the early centuries of the Christian era onwards by Hūnas and others for several centuries, while South India was much better off during those centuries. Therefore the Mos. of the works of comparatively early writers of the North are often not found in North India but only in South Indie (Bhānaha’s work on Poetics being a well-known instance</p>

<p>and copper. In the Indische studien', vol. XVIII pp. 289-412 a ms. of Lokaprakāśa of Ksemendra ( latter half of 11th century A.D.) is discussed in which the word dināra is frequently used (e. g. on pp. 339, 391 ) and we have a formula forward ing a dināra-hundikā' (on p. 342 ). Hundikā stands for &lsquo;Hundi used by travellers.</p>
<p>The time when Bhavasvāmin flourished is not free from doubt. Prof. Chintamani concludes (on p. 157 of Kunhan Raja volume) that Bhavasvāmin flourished in the early centu ries of the Christian era. I demur to this conclusion which is based mainly on Dr. Altekar&rsquo;s view quoted in a note on p. 157 that it is very unlikely that gold dīdāras were in cir culation after 600 A. D. in the Mathurā and Kanoj area.&rsquo; But it is clear that in the 11th century gold coins called Dināras were current in Kashmir and if Bhavasvāmin was a Kashmir ian or had travelled and stayed there for some time he would easily have known them and referred to them. Therefore, Dr. Altekar&rsquo;s opinion about Bhavasvāmin&rsquo;s date is worth little.</p>
<p>Bhavasvāmin refers several times to other explanations of Nārada&rsquo;s verses with the words &lsquo;anya aha&rsquo;as on &lsquo;inādana&rsquo; v. 195, “Strīpuṁsayoga&rsquo; v. 30, Dāya vibhāga verses 13, 14, prakirnaka v. 80. He refers here and there to different read ings in Nārada as on Ruādāna verses 67, 153, Vikrīyāsampra dāna, verse 12, Strīpumsayoga, verses 2, 3, 15, 16, 29, 83. He quotes about two dozen verses of Manu. His commentary ex plains the words of Nărada&rsquo;s verges, is generally concise, and makes no show of learning. He cites a few sūtras of Pāṇini a few passages as Śruti (as on mìādāna 53, 97). It is re markable that he cites (on mnādāna 190) &lsquo;nāputranya lokostīti&rsquo; as Smști, which is really Ait. Br. (VII.3). He quotes Vas. Dharmasūtra on mnādāna verse 94 and on Väg Dandapārusya verse 20. It is noteworthy that he speaks of the present Manusmrti as Bhrgu-Samhitā$5 or Bhārgavi</p>

He quotes Vālmiki and Vyäsa on Rnādāna' 628 verse 32. He quotes a Sárdūlavikridita verse on krodha' (anger) and a verse on unmāda'(delirium, or madness ) due to five causes on Dattāpradānika 8-10. Ou Rnülāna verse 31 he quotes an āryā on the importance of Ganita. On &lsquo;Rņādāna verge 72 Bhavasvāmin quotes a verse of Vararuci explaining the meaning of the words &lsquo;poganda, kuņi&rsquo; and ' pangu &lsquo;.527</p>
<p>As in Bhavasvīmin&rsquo;s day various readings had already arisen in the Näradasmrti and as he refers several times to the explanations of previous commentators, Bhavasvāmin would have to be placed (conjecturally ) some centuries after Nārada i. e. between 700 and 1000 A. D.</p>
<p>The late Prof. Rangaswami Aiyangar in his Introduction to Brhaspati assigns Bhavasvāmin to the 8th century A. D. and in the footnote 4 on that page le asserts &lsquo;Bhavasvamin, like Mädhavasvāmin and Skandasvāmin, belongs to a period long anterior to Visvarūpa (circa A. D. 800 ) and refers in support to Journal of Oriental Research V. 325&rsquo;. The reference to the journal appears to be wrong.</p>
<p>It may be noted that Visvarūpa quotes hardly any verses of Nārada on two epics not pertaining to Vyavahāra except one verse on Yāj. I. 34 where he speaks of three kinds of ștviks&rsquo;. But the same cannot be said about the Mitākṣarā. A few verses not strictly related to Vyavahāra topics are mentioned by it as occurring in Nārada&rsquo;s work. For example, on Yaj. III. 39 the Mit. quotes a verse of Närada that allows a brāhuana to sell sesame in exchange of food-grains for securing medicine when he is ill or for the purpose of a Yajña. This occurs in the section on Rnādāna ( 66 ). Aparārka also quotes this verse (p. 933 ). Probably it was part of the king&rsquo;s duty to remind a brāhmana of the restrictions laid down on him by śāstra. Aparārka ( p. 29 )</p>

<p>cites 24 verses on the actions that are comprehended under ista and pārtu. But the Smộticandrikū quotes from Nārada at least 50 verses on āhnika and at least 16 on śrāddha-kānda, one of which refers to Sunday and Sankranti and on the selection of Ekādaśī for &amp; fast when joined to the 10th or 12th tithi.</p>
<p>It is likely that non-Vyavahāra topics came to be added as Nārada&rsquo;s a century or two before 1000 A. D., since the Smộticandrikā (1150-1225 ) A. D. contains numerous verses of Nārada on nop-Vyavahāra matters. 528</p>
<p>It is difficult to say anything as to the home of Nārada. In the appendix on theft Nārada in one place says that in the south a silver kāršāpana is current, that in the east it is equal to twenty panas and that he does not follow the standard of kārsāpana current in the land of the five rivers.628 From these data and from the fact that the oldest mss. of Nārada come from Nepal and that an old commentary on Närada in Newāri was composed in Nepal, Dr. Jolly conjectures that Nārada&rsquo;s home was to be sought in Nepal. This is all pure guess-work. There is no reason why Nārada could not have hailed from Central India. The places where the oldest and best mss. of a work are found car bardly ever be indications of the original home of an ancient author. Bhāmaba is by common consent a Kashmirian writer on Poetics, but most of the mss. of his work so far found come from Southern India.</p>
<p>Prof. D. R. Bhandarkar (Carmichael Lectures 1918, p. 90), probably following the Nayacandrikā, hazards the conjecture that the writer called Piguna cited in the Kauţiliya is another name of Nārada. Beyond the bare fact that Nārada is often credited in the Purānas with the role of instigating feuds and quarrels and that the word piśuna means &ldquo;wicked, back biter”, there is nothing to support this identification.</p>

<p>In the Mahābhärata several opinions are attributed to Narada. One of them condemns the eating of flesh.530 The first half of the last verse is the same as Manu 5.52. Narada is credited with having divided utpätas (portents ) into three varieties.581 Nārada is said to have held the view that one must always be active.533 It appears that all these views are taken from some work or works from Nārada. The first is probably taken from Nārada&rsquo;s version of the Manusmrti of which the Puranas speak as stated above ( note 270).</p>

<li>Brhaspati Brbaspati as a sūtra writer on politics has been dealt with above ( section 26 ). In this section Brhaspati the jurist will be spoken of. The complete smrti of Bșhaspati on law has not yet been discovered. It will be, when discovered, a very precious monument of ancient India, exhibiting the high water mark of Indian acumen in strictly legal principles and definitions. Dr. Fübrer collected together 84 verses ascribed to Brhaspati in the legal treatises of Aparārka and others with German translation and notes ( Leipzig, 1879 ) and Dr. Jolly collected about 711 verses of Brhaspati on law and translated them in the Sacred Books of the East (vol. 33 ).</li>
</ol>
<p>Yāj. (I. 4-5 ) enumerates Brhaspati among the writers on dharma, but he is probably referring to Brlaspati&rsquo;s work on politics. The com. on the Nitivákyrimpta (p. 7) quotes the first verse of Brhaspati&rsquo;s Nitišastra.</p>
<p>We saw above how Bihaspati closely follows the extant Manusmrti, how he pointedly refers to the text of Manu ( notes 345-349) and therefore might by analogy be styled a vārtikakāra of Manu. In many places Brhaspati explains and illustrates the laconic treatment of Manu. Manu (8. 153 ) speaks of four varieties of interest (Cakra, Kāla, Kärita, and Kāyika ), but does not explain these terms. Brhaspati ex plains them clearly.534 Manu (8.49 ) enumerates five modes of recovering a debt (dharma, vyavahira, chala, ācarita, bala ) but leaves them unexplained ; Brhaspati devotes several verses to the explanation of these terms ( vide Kullüka on Manu 8. 49). Bșhaspati gives elaborate rules regarding partnership. Brhaspati enumerates nine ordeals ( of fire, water, poison, balance, kosa, taptamāsa, tundulas, dharmadharma, phala ); while Manu barely alludes to two. Manu devotes only three verses to samvidvyatikrama (8. 219-221 ), but Brhaspati must have devoted at least a score of verses to this topic, as Aparārka alone quotes 17 verses of Bphaspati on this title.</p>
<p>The order in which the topics of law appeard in Brhaspati can be settled with tolerable certainty from the quotations in Aparárka, Vivādaratnākara, Viramitrodaya and other works.</p>

<p>It was as follows:&ndash;the four stages of a law-suit, proof (kriyā, human of three sorts and divine ), witnesses (of 12 kinds ), documents ( ten kinds ), bhukti ( possession ), ordeals (nine), 18 titles, rnadana, niksepa, asvamivikraya, sambhuya-samu tthāna, dattāpradānika, abbyupetyā-suśrūşā, vetanasya anapakarma, svāmipalavivada, samvid-vyatikrama, vikriya sampradāna, sīmāvivāda, pārusya ( of two kinds ), sāhasa ( of three kinds), strisamgrahana, stripumdharma, vibhaya, dyuta samāhvaya, prakirnaka ( otherwise called &lsquo;nrpasraya vyava hăra&rsquo;, wrongs for which proceedings are set on foot by the king).</p>
<p>Bịhaspati was probably the first jurist to make a clear distinction between civil and criminal justice.636 He divided the eighteen titles into two groups, those springing from wealth ( 14 titles ) and those springing from injury to beings (4 titles). This distinction was probably dimly perceived by even Gautama, when he says that in disputes based on injury there is no hard and fast rule about witnesses (i. e. about their interest in the subject of dispute ).538 Bihaspati, like Narada lays down the rule that a legal decision should not be arrived at merely on the basis of śāstra and that when a decision is devoid of reasoning, there is loss of dharma, for even a good man may be held to be a bad one or what is good may be held to be sinful iv a judicial proceeding, just as Māndavya was held to be a thief on a decision without thoughtful reasoning. 637</p>

<p>Bphaspati gives such elaborate definitions and rules about procedure from the filing of the plaint to the passing of the decree that he can very well stand comparison with modern legislators on the same subjects.</p>
<p>Nārada and Bșhaspati agree very closely in several res pects. For example, both speak of three kinds of proof, four parts of a judicial proceeding, almost the same defects of plaints, four kinds of answer, four divisions of the law of gift and their sub-divisions, five modes of recovering debts, four kinds of sāhasa.</p>
<p>We have seen that Nārada departs from Manu in several essential matters. On the other hand Bșhaspati follows Manu very closely. But he too differs on some points from Manu, for example, we saw above how Brbaspati dissents from Manu on the question of the divisibility of clothes &amp;c. (uote 348 ). He appears to differ from Manu as to the maximum interest allowed on corn, fruit, wool and beasts of burden.588 Manu and Nārada are both silent as to the widow&rsquo;s right to succeed to her deceased husband&rsquo;s estate. But Bphaspati agreeing with Yājñavalkya makes her the first heir of her sonless</p>
<p>( Continued from the previous page ) The story of Mānda vya occurs also in Adiparva 63. 92–93 aod is also mentioned in the Arthasāstra of Kautilya, IV. 8. 12. The story in the epic differs from that stated in Arthasāstra which says: दृश्यते ह्यचोरोपि चोरमार्गे यदृच्छया संनिपाते चोरवेषशस्त्रभाण्डसामान्येन गृह्यमाणः चोरभाण्डस्थोपवासेन वा, यथाणिमाण्डव्यः कर्मक्लेशभयादचोरः &lsquo;akit sa gator: 1 In the epic, there is no mention of the fear of torture as in the Kauțiliya. &ldquo;Ani&rsquo; means &lsquo;gülāgra&rsquo;.

<p>husband.580 Br. says &lsquo;those who say that clothes and the like are not liable to partition have not bestowed proper thought (on that matter), as rich people might, have wealth largely consisting of clothes and ornaments. This is really a criticism of the Manusmrti but out of deference for Manu, the reference is impersonal. Aparārka p. 726 (five verses ) explains from Bphaspati how to partition these.</p>
<p>These considerations make it clear that Bịhaspati is cer tainly later than Manu and Yāj. It is difficult to state his exact relationship to Nārada. He agrees more closely with Manu than Nārada does, but in some respects such as defini tions and the rights of women he shows great advance over Nārada. So he is probably a contemporary of or not much later than Närada. He employs the word nāņaka 640 He de fines a dīnāra, also called &ldquo;suvarna&rdquo;, as equal to twelve dhānakas and says that a Jhānaka was equal to four andikās, an andikā being a copper paņa weighing a karşa and bearing a stamp.541 This agrees with what Nārada says about dināra. Dr. Jolly (S. B. E. vol. 33 p. 276 ) assigns Brhaspati to the 6th or 7th century A. D. But this is much later by several centuries than the evidence warrants. Kātyāyana was looked upon as an authoritative writer along with Nārada and Brhas pati by Visvarūpa and Medhătithi. This position he could not have attained in a century or two. So he cannot be plac ed later than the 6th century. Kātyāyana in several places quotes Bịhaspati as an authority. Aparārka quotes Kātya yana as saying that, according to Bșhaspati, pastures, ways,</p>

<p>clothes that are worn on the body, debts, (or books for use, according to others ) and what is set apart for religious pur poses should not be partitioned.642 Kātyāyana says that, according to Brhaspati, that wealth which a man acquires by means of his learning after refuting an opponent in a contest with a stake for the winner is styled &ldquo;vidyādhana&rdquo; and is not liable to partition 543; and what is acquired through valour &amp;c. by persons that were taught in the family or learnt under their father should be partitioned among the brothers, accord ing to Bịhaspati. If a man falsely denies his liability and if only a part of the claim is brought home to him, then he should be made to pay the whole.544 That the statement of a witness may be relied upon on a matter under his direct per ception owing to his being near the plaintiff and the defendant and not otherwise; so says Bphaspati.645 The foregoing exa mples show that Kātyāyana looked upon Brhaspati as an authority who must therefore have flourished several centu ries before. Therefore Bșhaspati cannot be placed later than the 4th century A. D. As he knew the extant Manusmrti, was later than Yāj. and probably than Nūrada, Bphaspati must have flourished between 200 and 400 A. D. This conclusion is strengthened by the fact that Visvarūpa quotes, without making any difference, prose and verse passages of Bșhaspati and thereby shows that in his opinion the jurist Brhaspati (in verse ) was identical with the political writer Bșhaspati and was a very ancient writer in his day. Medhātithi (on Manu 9. 153 ) quotes the verse“ na pratigrahabhūr&rdquo; (ascrib ed to Brhaspati by others ) as Smộtyantara. Bịhaspati is</p>

<p>cited in a few cases as referring to his own views in the third person 848 ; sometimes he uses the first person also.547 Nothing can be said about his country at present. In a well-known passage Byhaspati refers to the usages of the southern people, of the people in the Madhyadeśa, of the eastern and northern people.648 In a striking and beautiful passage Brhaspati compares vyavahare with yajna,549_the king with Visnu, the successful party with the sacrificer and the defeated party with the victim, the plaint and the reply to food and the pratijna to the sacrificial offering (prepared from food ), the sāstras to the three Vedas and the subhyas to the priests in a sacrifice. Brhaspati seems to have been very fond of such long-drawn metaphors.sh0</p>
<p>The Smộticandrika quotes about seventy verses of Bębas pati in the Ahnika portion and about forty on Srāddha. In the later works like the Parisara-Madhaviya, the Nirnaye. sindhu and Sarnskara-Kaustubha, the number of verses quot ed from Brhaspati is much larger than even those quoted by the Smộticandrikā. Those verses are quoted on such sams karas as pumsa.vana, namakarana, caula, upanayana. vivaha. and also ou ásauca and purification of dravyas. Even the Mitākşarī quotes several verses of Bphaspati on matters</p>

<p>other than those of vyavahiirit. For example, the Mit. on Yāj. I. 210 quotes a verse of Brhaspati that a nivartana ( of land ) is equal to 30 dandas in area (danda being seven cubits in length) and ten nivartanas are equal to a gocarma.851 On Yāj. III. 17 the Mit. quotes two verses of Bịhaspati about impurity on birth or death &amp;c. On Yāj. III. 21 the Mit. cites the definition of leśāntara given by Brhaspati.562 On Yāj. III. 24 the Mit quotes Brhaspati&rsquo;s opinion that the period of mourning on the death of one&rsquo;s maternal grandfather, ācārya or srctriya is three days. On Yāj. III. 253 the Mit. quotes Brhaspati&rsquo;s rule as to prāyaścitta for consciously drinking wine.868 Vide also Mit. on Yāj. III. 30, 250, 254, 260, 290 for other quotations from Brhaspati</p>
<p>The foregoing, therefore, establishes, that Bphaspati was known at least to the Mit. and later writers as an expounder in verge not only of vyavahāra but also of other topics of dbarma as well. As over a thousand verses of Bșhaspati (including about 800 on Vyavahāra ) are quoted it appears that his work must have been an extensive one comprising several thousand verses. Such a work of Bphaspati has yet to be recovered.</p>
<p>The Mit. on Yāj. III. 261 quotes a Vrddha-Bphaspati on the nine varieties of saṁkara.664 Kulluka on Manu (9. 181 ) cites a verse of Vșddha-Bphaspati about the eleven subsidiary</p>

<p>sons ( vide note 346 above, where the verse is ascribed to Bịhaspati ). Hemādri ( Caturvarga, vol. III, part 2, p. 472 ) quotes a Jyotir-Bșhaspati on the prohibition of a sraddha on the thirteenth tithi of the dark half. A parārka on Yáj. II. 3-4 quotes three verses from Vrddha&ndash;Brhasiati about the deriva tion of the word &ldquo;prāų-vivăka' and one on the punishment for sabhyas who take bribes. Three of these verses are ascrib ed to Brhaspati in the Paräsara-Mādhaviya and other work. and one of them to Katyayana in the Vyavahira-mītrkā.</p>
<p>After the publication of the first volume of the History of Dharmaśāstra in 1930' and the publication in 1933 by the present author in a book-form of the verses of Katyāyana (with English translation and notes ) on law and judicial procedure (originally contributed to a Journal on Hindu Law ), the late Prof. K. V. Rangaswami Aiyangar came to me in 1934, when I gave him a copy of the reconstruction of Kātyāyana. He asked me to attempt a similar reconstruction of Bfhaspati As I had by that time decided to bring out a large history of Dharmaśāstra, I refused to undertake what he suggested and asked him to make the attempt himself. He undertook the work of reconstructing Bịhaspati&rsquo;s Smrti and published it in 1941 in the well-known Gaekwad&rsquo;s Oriental Series ( Baroda ). That is a bulky volume in 732 pages. He not only collected the verses attributed to Bșhaspati on law and judicial procedure but also on other subjects. He arranged them in seven parts:(1) on Vyavahara in pp. 1-228 arranged in 29 chapters, ( 2 )on Samskāra (pp. 231-308 ), (3) Acāra (pp. 309-325), ( 4 ) Srāddha (pp. 326-351 ); ( 5 ) Asa uca (pp. 352-364 ); ( 6 ) Āpad-dharma pp. 365-372 ), ; (7) Prāyascitta (pp. 373-386). Besides a Preface, a list of Sans krit works drawn upon or referred to in the footnotes, an Index in Sanskrit of the topics dealt with (pp. 17-69 ), he contributed a learned and exhaustive Euglish Introduction (pp. 71-186 ) and an alphabetical (Sanskrit ) Index of quarters of the verses included in the section on Vyavahāra (pp. 387-459 ) and another Index of half-verses on sections other than Vyavahāra (pp. 460-492); he also gives a list of additional texts found after the work was sent to the Press Up. 493-499 ), a list of authors and works cited if the text of Brhaspati), additions to footnotes (pp. 502-536 and lastly a comparative statement of verses translated from Dr. Jolly (in SBE Vol. 33, 1889 ) and in the work that he</p>
<p>492</p>
<p>History of Dharmasastra</p>
<p>collected and edited. This work is a laborious performance. It should have been accompanied by an English translation and notes on difficult passages. I have, however, to differ from it in some places and am further obliged to say that, in spite of all the labour he bestows, he some how failed to notice some verges and prose passages of Byhaspati as having been men tioned by Visvarūpa and others. Dr. Jolly (in S. B. E. vol. 33 ) collected and translated 717 verses of Brhaspati on</p>
<p>Vyavahāra'.</p>
<p>Prof. Aiyangar on p. 73 of his Introduction states that Dr. Jolly published an English rendering of 697 Slokas on Vyavahāra attributed to Brhaspati. To me it is not clear how he arrived at the smaller figure of 097. Probably there is some mistake in making the total of the verses in the 27 Bections of the translation. Prof. Aiyangar further says (on p. 73 of the Introduction) that the number of Slokas (includ. ing under the term a few passages in prose) dealing with Vyavahāra is 1372, nearly double the number collected by Dr. Jolly,</p>
<p>Dr. Jolly rightly says at the beginning of his Introduc tion to the translation of Brhaspati&rsquo;s verses &lsquo;the fragments of Bphaspati&rsquo; are among the most precious relics of the early legal literature of India.</p>
<p>Aparārka (on Yāj. II. 151 pp. 761-62), Kalpataru (on Vyavahāra on pp. 450-51 ) and Smrticandrika ( Vyavahāra, p. 234, Gharpure) contain 8 or 9 verses of Bịhaspati about the loss or gain of lands by the change in the courses of rivers or when a king grants lands from one village as situated in another.</p>
<p>The Vyavahăranirnaya of Varadarāja cites a verse (on p. 132 ) as Bphaspati&rsquo;s in the work called Pancādhyāyi' and again ( on p. 357 ) simply a verse in &lsquo;Pascădhyāyī.&rsquo; It is possible that Pascadhyāyi is an independent work in which Bphaspati was quoted or it may be that Pañcüdhyāyi is the name of the work of Brhaspati himself. 666</p>

<p>Prof. Aiyangar says ( on p. 493 of his reconstructed Brhaspati) that certain passages ( both nir. prose and verse ) attributed to Bșhaspati in different Nibandbas were noticed by him after the text had been sent to the press and then gets out only two passages in prose from Visvarūpa&rsquo;s Bālakrida The commentary of Visvarūpa was published at Trivandrum in two parts, the first in 1922 ( on Yāj. I and II, ācāra and vyavahara) and the 2nd in 1924 (on Prayascitta). He began to collect materials for the reconstruction of Brhaspati after 1934. Therefore, he could have secured many more prose passages attributed to Brhaspati by Visvarūpa. I set out a few more prose passages of Brhaspati from Visvarūpa&rsquo;s com mentary alone. They are ten in all, most of which refer to Vyavahāra.b58 Visvaripa also quotes five verses of Brhaspati,</p>

<p>which have been noticed by Prof. Aiyangar. He, it appears, regards the quotations in prose and verse as belonging to the same author. In one proge quotation Brhaspati is mentioned by name as stating a certain proposition. It is possible that Visvarüpa regarded that all quotations (both prose and in verse) are to be attributed to oue author. One cannot dogma tise on such a point. But it is quite likely that the author of the verses was different from the author of the Sūtras quoted by Visvarūpa.</p>
<p>Prof. Louis Renou of Paris contributed to volume VI (1962) of the Indo-Iranian Journal ( Publishers, Moulton and Co., the Hague ) pp. 81-102 a learned paper (in French ) on the edition of the fragments of Brhaspati (collected ) by Prof. K. V. Rangaswami Aiyangar. It is not possible to mention here for reasons of space even the most salient points of his criticisms against Prof. Aiyangar&rsquo;s edition of Bșhas pati. On p. 83 note 2 he observes that Prof. Aiyangar has not made use of P. V. Kane&rsquo;s learned edition of the fragments of Kätyāyana with translations and points out that the word &lsquo;nāsţika&rsquo; which is explained in H. of Dh. Vol. III pp. 464-5 and the incidents of the sale by a finder of an article lost by the owner (in Kātyāyana 622-623 ) are not set out by Prof. Aiyangar. It is unnecessary for the present author to dwell on the omissions pointed out by Prof. Reuou in Prof. Aiyangar&rsquo;s work, which latter simply collects passages with enormous details about the works and pages where the verses of Bịhaspati occur with hardly a word of explanation anywhere.</p>

<li>Katyayana Nārada, Bșhaspati and Kātyāyana form a triumvirate in the realm of the ancient Hindu Law and procedure. The work of Kätyāyana on Vyavahāra, like that of Bphaspati, has yet to be recovered. After the first volume of H. of Dh. was published in 1930, I contributed to a Law Journal in Bombay &amp; collec tion of Kātyäyana&rsquo;s verses gathered from quotations in 21 works and later (in 1933 ) published in a book form 973 verses of Kātyāyana with English translation, two Appendices and a General Index (in all 372 pages). Later on Prof. K. V. Rangaswami Aiyangar contributed a paper to the Kane Fest schrift (pp 7-17) embodying 121 additional verses of Kātyāyana from the work called Vyavahāranirnaya of Vara darāja ( which he published in 1942 48 No. 29 of the Adyar Library series ).</li>
</ol>
<p>Kātyāyana is enumerated as one of the expounders of dhurma by Sarkha-Likhita, Yájňavalkya ( I. 4-5 ) and Parā Sara. A Kâtya is quoted as an authority in the Baudhāyana dharmasūtra (I. 2. 37). A Srautasūtra and Sraddhakalpa of the white Yajurveda are ascribed to Kätyāyana.</p>
<p>Kātyāyana appears to have taken Närada and Bphaspati as his models in the order and treatment of the subjects to be dealt with on vyavahāra. He closely follows both the writers in terminology and technique. On several points he presu pposes Närada and expounds and elucidates the latter&rsquo;s dicta. For example, Nārada ( Intro, chap. I. 10-11 ) lays down that Vyavahăra has four pādas, each later one prevailing, viz. dharma, vyavahāra, caritra, rājasásana (note 361 ) and then Nārada very briefly in one verse explains these four terms; Kätyāyana, on the other hand, devotes at least nine verses to the elucidation of the rule as to each succeeding one prevailing over its predecessor. 568 Nārada contains very little on the topic of strīdhana (dāyabhāga chap. verses 8-9). He merely enumerates the six kinds of strīdhana and then lays down the rule of succession. Kātyāyana&rsquo;s treatment of stridhana has attained classical rank. It appears that he was probably the first to carefully define the several kinds of stridhana (such as adhyagni, adhyāvahanika, prītidatta, sulka, anya dheya, saudãyika), to lay down woman&rsquo;s power of different</p>

<p>over the several varieties of stridhana and to prescribe lines of devolution as to stridhana. The verses on this topic occu rring in the nibandhas number ubout thirty. The leading nibandhas contain only a few quotations from Brhasrati on strīdhana. Hence it may be surmised that Kītyāyana proba bly was the first smộti writer to give elaborate rules on this topic.</p>
<p>It has been already shown how Kātyāyana often quotes the views of Bịhaspati. A few more examples may be added here. According to Brhaspati, says Kātyā yana, when a man who stands surety with others on a joint liability goes abroad, his son would have to pay the whole debt, but if the man dies then the son would be liable for his father&rsquo;s share only.&rdquo; Wheu cattle stray into fields, gardens, houses or cowpens, they may be, according to Brhas pati, caught hold of ( by the ear &amp;c. ) or beaten.580 According to Bșhaspati, a man of the ksatriya, vaisya or sūdra caste may employ one of his own caste to do the work of a dāsa (slave or serf ), but even a Brålana could never employ another Brāhmana in the same way.561</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>More than 21 nibandhas on Vyavahāra quote about 1100 verses of Katyayana on vyavahara, the Smộticandrikā alone citing about 600 of them. In these verses Katyāyana refers at least a score of times to the views of Burgu. It is remarka ble that only a few of the views ascribed to Bhrgu are found in the extant Manusmrti. Katyayana says, according to Bhrgu, whatever ( ancestral) wealth was concealed by one coparcener from others, whatever was badly divided should be divided in equal shares when afterwards discovered ( Parā. Sara-Mülhaviya III, p. 566). This may well be compared with Manu 9. 215. Kātyāyanu says, according to Bhrgu, it is not Brāhmana-murder to kill an ātatayin who is foremost by his austerities, learning and caste. This has in view Manu</p>

<li>Kullāka distinctly says that Katyayana simply ex. plains the verse of Manu by referring to it as Bhrgu&rsquo;s. On the other hand, there are several places where the views ascribed to Bhrgu find no counterpart in the extant Manu. Bhrgu seems to have been a predecessor of the author of the extant Manusmrti since it mentions ( III. 16) the view of Bhrgu. The Mit. on Yaj. III. 292 quotes a verse of Bhrgu. Visvarupa also quotes a verse of Bhrgu on Yaj. I.79 and ano ther on Yaj. I.187, both of which are not found in the Manu smrti. Aparārka quotes in all four verses of Bhrgu (on pp. 58, 461, 547, 696 ). The Sinșticandrikā,561a after dilating upon the two superior places cited by Manu ( viz, the king or a judge appointed by the king where disputes are decided ) quotes three verses of Bhrgu which refer to 15 inferior tribu nals for decision in some special matters. The Smộticandrikā also quotes several verses of Blırgu on Srāddha, two of which are interesting and indicate that the Bhrgu it quotes is : much later writer than Manu, as they refer to the position of the Sun in rāfis ( signs of the zodiac ).</li>

<p>According to Bhrgu in all sāhasas of the worst type the truth should be found out by means of divine proof (ordeals &amp;c. ) even though there may be witnesses.Sea There is nothing in the Manusmrti corresponding with this.

<p>incurred popular censure, but in such cases there is no under taking (by the complainant to pay fine ).583 The Manusmrti has not a word on this point. Household para phernalia, beasts of burden, cattle, ornaments, slaves should be divided when discovered ; if they are ( alleged to be ) concealed, the ordeal of kośa should be resorted to; 80 says Bhrgu.864 Another important circumstance that deserves to be noted is that Kātyāyana several times refers to the views of Manu. Kātya yana says that the view of Manu was &lsquo;In those disputes (or crimes ) for which ordeals are forbidden (to be administered to perpetrators ) the king should make efforts to have them performed by good men on their behalf (if available); he should not abandon the person charged (without testing his guilt by proxy )': this is the view of Manu.686 According to Manu, if a woman deserted her son, though he may be able (to pay ), her stridhana should be seized and the paternal debt should be paid thereout. 686 Manu declared, says Kātyāyana, that if animals be killed, the offender should offer (to the owner) another similar animal or its proper price. All these views attributed to Manu by Kâtyāyana are not found in the extant Manusmrti. In certain places Kätyāyana refers to the views of the Mänavas; e. g. according to the Gärgiyas and Mänavas if a bribe had already been paid, the person receiving it should be made to repay it and should be fined eleven times as much ; 567 according to the Mānavas thieves caught red</p>

<p>handed with their booty should be at once banished.568 As regards both these references, the teaching of the Manusmrti seems to be different; vide Manu I. 231 and 270 respectively. These facts about Katyayana&rsquo;s references to Bhrgu and Manu raise several difficult questions, whether Bhrgu and Manu stand for two entirely different works or for the same work and whether he refers to some other version of the Manusmrti ascribed to Bhrgu. In my opinion he is not referring to two separate works, and that he had before him a version of the Manu</p>
<p>but somewhat different from and probably larger than the present Manusmrti.</p>
<p>In the nibandhas several.verses are ascribed to Kātya yana along with Manu, Yājîavalkya and Brhaspati. For example, the well-known verse about the sixtold division of stridhana (adhyaynyadhyāvahanikam &amp;c. ) is ascribed by the Dāyabhāga to Manu and Kätyāyana. The half-verse &ldquo;varņā nāmānulomyena dāsyam na pratilomatah&rdquo; is the same in both Yājñavalkya (11. 183 ) and Katyāyana. The Viramitrodaya (p. 140 ) ascribes a verse to Brhaspati and Kätyāyana, in which the opinion of Brhaspati is cited. There is very close agreement between the definitions proposed by the two last writers of dharma, vyavahāra, caritra, and răjaśāsana. Besides Manu (or Mānavas ), Byhaspati and Bhrgu, Kātyāyana cites the views of several other writers on dharma. For Gārgyas and Gautama vide uotes 567 and 568. He says, accord ing to Kausika, powerful robbers were to be guarded by chains of iron, were to be low-fed and were to undergo hard labour for the state till death ( Aparărka p. 849). He quotes the view of Likhita that where a woman is deprived of food, raiment and dwelling (by her husband&rsquo;s coparceners ) she would be entitled to demand her own ( stridhana ) and a share from the coparceners. In one case ( Aparārka p. 755 ), a verse is cited as Kätyāyana&rsquo;s in which Katyāyana himself is named (Parāśaramadhaviya III. p. 235).</p>
<p>Kātyāyana contains the same advanced views about law and rules of procedure as are found in Närada and Bșhaspati.</p>

<p>He is even in advance of these two writers in certain matters, such as detinitions in general and the elaboration of rules about stridhana. He gives numerous definitions, such as those of vyavahara, pridviváka, stobhaka, dharmădhikarana, tirita anii anusista, samanta &amp;c. He seems to have been the first to invent some new terins. For example, he defines pascātkāra as a judgment given in favour of the plaintiff after a hot coutest between the plaintiff and the defendant, while the term jyapatra is restricted by him to the judgment given on admission by the defendant or a judgment dismissing the suit on various grounds.509 He lays down a stringent rule that if a man abandons a ground of defence or attack and puts forward a less cogent one, he would not be allowed to put forward again the stronger ground after a decisive judg ment of the court.970 This resembles the 4th explanation to section 11 of the Indian Civil Procedure Code (1908 ) about res judicuta. The verses about kärpapana and dināra quoted above (note 368 ) from Närada (parisista verses 58-60) are ascribed to Kātyāyana by the Smộticaudrikā.</p>
<p>The date of Kātyāyana can be settled only approxi mately. He is certainly much later than Manu and Yājña valkya. As shown above he presupposes Nārada and regarded Bșhaspati as a very leading authority on vyavabāra. Hence his upper limit is the 3rd or 4th century A. D. Viśvarūpa quotes eight verses as Kātyāyana&rsquo;s by naine ( vide on Yāj. II. 5, 6, 47, 63, 281 ) on such topics of Vyavahāra as the defects of the plaint, the contents of the plaint, the liability for the debts of a deceased person, payments of debts of honour (satyamkāra ), punishment for abortion, grievous hurt and homicide of a brāhmana woman. Medhătithi (on Manu 7. 1 ) ascribes to Katyāyana the rule that in case of conflict between the dictates of dharmaśāstra and arthaśāstra the king should prefer the forener. Medlătithi on Manu ( VIII 216 ) speaks of Kityāyana-sutra, appears to quote a portion</p>

<p>of it in prose and explains it. 571 Medhātithi says that Kātya yana extended the maxim of the trader carrying merchandise (bhāndavāha-vanik maxim ) to all similar transactions. All known quotations of Kātyāyana are in verse. When Medhā tithi speaks of a sutra and quotes a portion of it (as &ldquo;vā&rdquo; and &ldquo;iti&rdquo; after “nivarteta &quot; indicate ) in prose, we must either suppose that he is referring to some other work of Kätyāyana than the one in verge from which hundreds of verses are cited by other writers or that Kātyāyana&rsquo;s work on vyavahāra also contained some proge passages. As hardly any other writer quotes a prose passage of Kätyāyana on vyavahāra, the second alternative appears somewhat unlikely. Visvarūpa and Medbâtithi regarded Katyāyana as an authoritative smrtikāra along with Närada and Bșhaspati. This position he could not have attained in less than a few hundred years. Therefore, the lowest limit to which Kātyāyana can be assign ed is the 6th century. Hence it may be said that Kätyāyana flourished between the 4th and 6th century A. D.</p>
<p>The Vyavahāramātşkā (p. 307 ) quotes a Brhat-Kātya yana on the question of proof. The Dāyabhāga mentions &amp; Vțddha-Kātyāyana. The Sarasvatīvilāsa also quotes verses of Vrddha-Kātyāyana on rescission of purchase and other topics (p. 320). In the present state of our knowledge it is very difficult to say whether these two are different works, The Caturvarga-cintāmaņi (vol. III, part 2, p. 657) speaks of Upakātyāyana. Aparārka on p. 485 quotes a verse from sloka-Kātyāyana which is not found in the Karmapradipa (Jivananda&rsquo;s ed. ), but appears to be a summary of a prose passage quoted as Kātyāyana&rsquo;s immediately before by Aparārka.</p>
<p>In Jivananda&rsquo;s collection of smrtis ( part I, pp. 603-644 ) there is one of Kātyāyana in three prapāthakas and 29 khandas and about five hundred verses. The same work is printed as Gobhilasmộti in the Anandāśrama collection (pp. 49–71). It contains also a few prose passages in the 12th, 13th and 14th khandas. The prevailing metre is Anustubh, a few verses being in the Indra vajrā and other metres. The</p>

<p>work is styled the Karmapradipa of Kātyāyana. The opening verse justifies this name when it states that like a lamp the work will clearly show the mode of performing certain rites treated by Gobhila and other rites which are not clearly elucidated.572 The contents of this work are briefly as follows:- how to wear the sacred thread; sipping water and touching various limbs with water; the worship of Ganesa and fourteen mātrs in every rite; kusas; śrāddha details; consecration of sacred fires; details about aranīs, sruc, sruva; rules about cleansing the teeth and bathing; sandhyā; prāṇā. yāma, muttering of Vedic mantras ; tarpana of gods and manes; the great daily yajñas; who is to offer srāddha; rules about periods of impurity due to death; duties of wife; Grāddhas of various kinds.</p>
<p>The Karma prudīpa mentions by name several authorg. It very frequently cites the views of Gobhila (pp. 603, 626, 638 ) and Gautama (pp. 619, 620, 626, 630, 636, 639 ). The Karmapradipa as the opening verse says is intimately related to the Gobhila Gșhyasūtra. It distinctly says that as Gobhila did not dilate upon the details as to time and procedure of goyajña and vajiyajña, Kätyāyana dilates upon them. This is borne out by the Gobhila grhya-sūtru673 Another passage of Kātyāyana574 about the Astakās is based upon the very words of the Gobhila-grhya. Frequent reference is made to the views of Vasistha on the worship of Mātrs (p. 605), on Grāddha (pp. 608, 625). Vide also p. 642 ( 28. 16). Among the other authors named are Nārada on the sticks for danta dhāvana ( p. 615), Bhārgava (probably Ušanas ) on p. 640,</p>

<p>Sāndilya and Sandilyāyana on p. 626. Kātyāyana is named in several places (pp. 624, 627, 638 ) and once the first person is used ( as in &ldquo;mamāpyetad hrdi sthitam” p. 643). The Kātyāyanasmrti quotes the verse of Manu (111.70 ) on the five great yajñas. On p. 633 four verses forming the conso lation to be offered to the relatives of a person departed are the same as Yáj. (III. 8-11) and one verse in the same con text occurs in the Mahâbliālata (Säntiparva 27.31 and other places ).578 On p. 631 Kātyāyana speaks of Rāma having performed yajñas taking as his spouse the golden image of Sītā.</p>
<p>The question is:-what is the date of this Katyāyana omști ( Karmapradipa ) and whether it is the work of Katya yana the great jurist. The Mit. (on Yāj. I. 254 ) quotes a verse as Kätyāyana&rsquo;s which occurs in Jivananda&rsquo;s text (P. 624 verse 20 ); similarly the Mit. quotes two verses as Katya yana&rsquo;s (on Yāj. III. 247) which have a place in the Karmapradipa (Jivananda p. 634 verses 4-5). Scores of verses cited as Katyāyana&rsquo;s by Aparărka (on ācāra and prāyaścitta ) are found in the Karmapradipa. For example, vide A parārka p. 43 (three verses ) and Karmapradipa (1.605, 1110-12), Aparārka p. 51 ( three verses abont samull) and Karmapr. (p. 613, 8. 17-19), Aparārka p. 135 ( four verses about bathing in rivers ) and Karma. (p. 615, 10.5-7 and 14), Aparărka p. 532 ( fuur verses on sraddha in which Kätyāyana himself is cited as an authority ) and Karma. (p. 624, 16. 16-19), Aparārka p. 872 ( six verses ) and Karma. (21. 2-7 p. 632 ), Aparārka p. 1066 (three verses about an nihutrin being guilty of mahāpătaka ) and Karma. (23. 4-6 p. 634 ). The Smộticandrikā also quotes profusely from Kātyāyana on ācāra, srāddha etc. and cites from the Karmapradipa by name passages which occur in Jivananda&rsquo;s edition. The above re ferences show that in the eyes of the Mităksarã and Aparārka the Karmapradipa was an authoritative work. Therefore, it follows that it must have been composed long before the 11th century A. D. It is, however, remarkable that several quotations ascribed to Katyāyana in the Mitūksarī, Aparārka and other works are not found in the Karmajiradipa. For example, the Mitäksară (on Yñj. III. 242 ) cites Kätyāyana&rsquo;s</p>

These are not to be traced in the Karmapradīpa printed by Jivananda. Similarly, Aparārka (pp. 94-95) quotes three verses of Kātyāyana that are very interesting but are not found in Jivananda&rsquo;s edition.676 Later works like the Nirnayaşindhu, the Saṁskāramayukha, the Madanapări jāta quote numerous verses of Kityāyana on upanayana, marriage and other saṁskāras which we vainly seek to find in the Karmapradipa. It is better to hold with Dr. R. C. Hazra that several works were ascribed to Kātyāyana, though they were composed by different persons. Vide New I. A, vol. VII at pp. 64-65.</p>
<p>The next question is whether KĀtyāyana the jurist and the author of the Karmapradipa are identical. There are not sufficient data to identify the two. The only fact that points to the identity is that such eminent and early writers as Vijñānesvara and Aparārka appear to make no distinction between the two. Besides, the Karmapradipa is also an early work. Against this it has to be remembered that Visvarūpa, probably the most ancient of all extant commentators, no where quotes Kātyāyana ou acăra and prayascitta. This absence of quotations is not a very cogent argument; still it raises a doubt in one&rsquo;s mind whether a work of Katyāyana on ācāra and other non-jural topics was known to Visvarūpa.</p>
<p>A few words must be said about the additional 121 verses collected and published in Kane Festschrift by Prof. Aiyangar as ascribed to Kātyāyana.

<p>It is difficult to say why these differences arise. All that can be proposed as the rule to be followed is that the ascrip tion to Br, or Kāt. of a verse should be accepted on this basis that one should follow what the older and distinguished authors and works ( such as Visvarūpa, Mitākṣarā, Aparārka, Kalpataru, Vyavahāramātņkā, Smộticandrikă and Parāśara Madhaviya ) say or a majority of them say.</p>

<p>History of Dharmaśāstra</p>
<p>Angiras laying down prāyaścitta for killing certain beasts and birds, wherein Angiras himself is men tioned with honour (bhagavān ). Aparārka (pp. 22-23 ) quotes thirteen verses from Arigiras on the constitution of parişad, wherein such terms as cãturvilya, vitarkī, angavid, dharmapāthaka are explained and the last of which says that</p>
<p>parişcıd sitting in judgment over those who are guilty of mahāpāta kas may consist of hundreds. The Mitāksarā ( on Yāj. I. 86 ) quotes several verses on the practice of satī and escribes them to both Sankha and Angiras.579 Aparārka (pp. 109, 112 ) quotes four other verses on the same practice, one of which is in the Indravajrā metre and another prohibits &amp; brāhmana wife from following that practice. Medhātithi (on Manu. V. 157 ) quotes the view of Angiras on satī and disapproves of it. The Mitakşara, Haradatta and others quote numerous verses of Angiras on åsauca and priyaścitta. Haradatta on Gautama (20. I) quotes a verse of Angiras about the seven antyajas, 580 Visvarūpa (on Yāj. III. 237 ) quotes a sutra of Sumantu in which Angirasa is cited as an authority. The Suddhi-mayūkha quotes a verse of Angiras which relies upon Sätātapa.681 The Smộticandrikä quotes Angiras on the enumeration of Upasmộtis ( vide note 260 above). The Smșticandrikā also contains a few proge quota tions from Angiras; the same work cites à verse of Arigiras holding the dharmaśāstra of Manu as the supreme guide.882</p>
<p>The Angiras-smrti (in Jivananda part I, pp. 554-560 ) in 72 verses is probably an abridgment. It lays down prayas cittas for various occasions, such as taking food and drink from antyajus, for cruelly beating or causing various injuries to cows. It also lays down various rules for the wearing of the dark cloth (nīlivastra ) by women. It cites Angiras and Apastamba by name. The penultimate verse condemns those who rob women of their wealth.</p>

<p>In the Anandāśrama collection of Smộtis (published in 1905 ) there is an Angiras-Smrti in 168 verses. At the begin ning it is said that, when asked by Bharadvāja and others, Angiras declared the Smrti dealing with rules of prāyascitta. It names the following Smrtikāras, viz. Sankhalikhita ( in v. 15), Sumantu ( in v. 26 ), Apastamba ( v. 76 ), Manu ( v. 86 ), Angiras ( 147 and 155 ). In 1953 Mr. A. N. Krishna Aiyan. gar published an Angirasasmrti at Adyar. This is different from the preceding two works and contains over 1200 ślokas. Pandit Manoranjan Sastri (of Gauhati) claims that he has found the insg. of a different Argirasasmrti compiled before 14th century A. D. (p. 100 of the Pragjyotisa Souvenir pub lished by him at the time of the All India Oriental Conference at Gauhati in January 1965). As the text is not yet available to scholars, and no reasons are given except the learned Pandit&rsquo;s opinion on reading the Kämarūpa Ms., other scholars have to suspend their judgment. The Kalpataru (on Suddhi p. 18 ) states that Vasistha and Angiras have certain passages in common ( vide note below ).583</p>
<p>There are several mss. in the Govt. Mss. Library at the Bhandarkar Institute ( Pooua ) wbich contain a varying number of verses on prāyascitta agreeing more or less with Jivananda&rsquo;s text. For example, No. 53 of 1879-80 contains about one hundred verses, No. 205 of 1882-83 contains 54 verges, while No. 65 of Visrām bāg collection and No. 83 of 1895-1902 contain only 32 ; No. 81 of 1884-86 is styled Bșhad&ndash;Argiras and contains 151 verses, many of which are identical with those in the Calcutta text.</p>

<p>The Mitâksarā (on Yáj. 111. 277 ) and the Smştiratnávali of Vedācārya (I. O. cat. No. 1552 p. 475 ) quote &amp; Bșhad Angiras and the Mităksarā also quotes a Madhyama Angiras several times (on Yaj. III. 243, 247, 258 and 260 ).</p>

II. 32 ( Mattonmattārta &amp;c) to Rsyaśşnga also. Aparārka (p. 724 ) quotes one verse of Rsya&rsquo;, on Vyavahāra viz. &lsquo;If one coparcener in a joint family recovers by his efforts pro perty lost to the fumily, he should be awarded one-fourth of it and the remaining portion should be distributed among the remaining coparceners according to their proper shares.

Two other verges which it contains are indicated as interpolated in several editions of Manu.586 It says that the teachings of Arhat, Cārvāka and Buddha delude people. 588 Its position is that whatever is not found in the Veda or the Puranas, the Rāmāyana, or Mahābhārata or in the sāstras of Manu and others is as good as non-existent. 687</p>

<p>Medhātithi. It was probably compiled about the time when the latter two writers flourished. Aparārka 589 (p. 1121 ) quotes a prose passage from the work on the prayascitta for a dvijāti procreating children on a Sūdra wife. This passage could not be traced in the two mss. referred to above.</p>
<p>The Mit. on Yāj. III. 58 quotes the Caturo for the proposition that a person resorting to the 4th āśrama (i.e. Sannyāsa ) may be &lsquo;ekadaņdin&rsquo; or &lsquo;tridandin&rsquo;. The Mit. quotes several verses from the Caturo on penances (prayas cittas ) for serious and light sins or offences. It suggests alternative penances for even very heinous sins, e. g. on Yāj. III. 308 it provides that if a person performs the Japa of Gāyatrī (Rg. III. 62. 10 tat-savitur-varenyaṁ ) a crore of times he atones for the sin of brāhmana murder, becomes free from the sin of drinking liquor by japa of Gāyatrī 80 lakhs of times, from the sin of the theft of gold by repeat ing 70 lakhs of times the Gāyatri. The Smrti-candrikā quotes Caturo many times on Ahnika and on Sraddha. It quotes the opinion of Baudhāyana in a verse and goes so far as to say that a man becomes free from sins by the japa of Brāhmaṇa works, the six angas, the ākhyānas ( legends ), Itihāsa, Purālas and praises of gods and expositions on Dharma. Aparārka also quotes about 60 verses of Caturvimsatimata and one proge passage on p. 1121 ( quoted below ).</p>
<p>Anothor somewhat remarkable point is that A parārka in several cases places Caturvimsatimata passages immediate ly near Şat-trimsatmata passages (vide Aparārka pp. 1081, 1172–74, 1182, 1248 ).</p>

<li>Daksa</li>

<p>Dakşa is one of the writers on dharma enumerated by Yāj. Vigvarūpa quotes verses of Daksa several times, viz. on Yāj. 1. 17 (on clods of earth for purifying the body ), on Yāj. III. 30 (two verses on āśauca ), on Yāj. III. 66 ( about &amp; parivrājaka ), on Yáj. III. 191 (about padmāsada ). The Mit. (on Yāj. I. 89) quotes a half verse of Daksa to the effect that a dvija should not remain unattached to an asrama (i. e. without a wife in the context ) even for a moment; on Yāj. III. 58 two verses about bhikṣus; on Yāj. III. 243 (one verse ). Aparārka cites numerous verses of Dakşa on ācāra, āśauca, srāddha and similar topics. In one case (p. 368 ) be attributes a prose passage to Dakşa about the gift of gold.500 Two of Daksa&rsquo;s verses most frequently quoted by writers on vyavahăra are those that lay down wbat nine things cannot be the subjects of gift.601</p>
<p>In Jivananda&rsquo;s collection there is a Daksasmộti (part II, pp. 383-402 ) in seven chapters and 220 verses (vide also Anandāsrama collection pp. 72&ndash;84), M. N. Dutt&rsquo;s collection Vol. I. pp. 291-309. The principal subjects treated of are : Four asramas, two kinds of brahmacūrins; the daily round of duties for dvijas; various subdivisions of actions, nine karnans vine vikarmang nine actions that should be concealed, nine acts that should be made public, nine things that should not be gifted; gifts; eulogy of a good housewife; sauca of two kinds; impurity due to birth and death ; Yoga and its six angas viz. präụāyāma, dhyāna, pratyāhāra, dhārană, tarka and gamádbi; maithuna of eight kinds to be avoided by ascetics ; duties of bhikṣu, dvaita, and advaita.</p>

<p>Dakşasmrti contains the name of Daksa himself and shows that he was a thorough-going Advaitin (as the note shows ).582</p>
<p>This smrti is certainly a very old one. All the quota tions from Daksa cited by Visvarūpa occur in the printed Daksa (vide pp. 395, 396, 384, 397 which reads &lsquo;na pathyā sanād yogo&rsquo;). Similarly all the quotations in the Mit. from Daksa are found in the Calcutta text. Aparārka contains over forty verses from the printed Dakşa, though there are a few verses cited by him as Dakşa’s which are not found therein. The Smộticandrikā quotes about ten verses of Dakša on woman which are all found in the 4th chap. of the Calcutta text.</p>
<p>In the Govt. Mos. library at the B. O. R. Institute Poona, there is a ms. of Daksa (No. 120 of 1895–1902), which contains 197 verses on the same topics as above, many of which are identical with the Calcutta text.

<p>Pitāmaba is enumerated among writers on dharma in a verse of VỊddha-Yājsavalkya quoted by Visvarūpa. The Smrti of Pitāmaha (part I p. 10) is drawn upon mostly on Vyavabāra. Visvarūpa cites (on Yaj. I. 17 ) &amp; verse from him on sauca.603 The Mitākṣarā and Aparārka respective ly quote about 45 and 75 verses from Pitāmaba only on Vyavabāra and specially on ordeals and the Kalpataru on Vyavahāra quotes about 90 verses on the same topics from Pitāmaha. Some verses are ascribed to both Pitāmaha and Nārada (as in Kalpataru Vy. pp. 238, 239) and in a few cases to Bșhaspati and Pitāmaba (as in Kalpataru, Vy. p. 251 ). The Smộticandrikā quotes about ten verses (of Pito ) on āhnika, 130 on Vyavahāra and only a few on srāddha. Pitāmaha regards the Vedas with the angas, Mimāṁsā, the</p>

The Smsticandrikā quotes a dozen verges about 50 chalas on which a king took action without any complaint.588 Pitāmaha seems to have followed Vyāsa in defining documents called krayapatra, sthitipatra, samdhipatra, visuddhipatra.sor The Smộticandrikā cites Pitāmaha for an enumeration of the 18 pralertis viz. washerman, leather worker, etc.be8 The same work states that according to Pitāmaha the titles of law to be taken cognisance by the king himself were twenty-two.

The Smộticandrika quotes about forty verses from Pulastya on ähnika and srāddha. In one place it quotes Pulastya on the efficacy of bathing on Sunday, Tuesday, and Saturday.

Another reason is that he appears to have dealt in his work with all three branches of Dharmaśāstra, viz. ācāra, vyavahāra and prayascitta. Another important matter is that quotations in prose from him far outnumber quotations in verse in the comparatively early digests like the Mit., Aparārka, Kalpataru. Visvarūpa on Yāj.

Two intere sting prose passages 610a on Vyavahāra also occur, one being that the wealth of a man dying sopless goes to his brother, in default of brother, to parents or to the senior one among his wives. On p. 1175 Apararka quotes a long prose passage mentioning 18 persons at whose house one should not dine, nor sit for dinner in the same row with them and who are unfit to be invited at a śrāddha. An interesting passage cited by Aparārka about marriage is as follows: A man should choose a girl whose ( father&rsquo;s ) gotra is not the same as his. He should avoid girls who are within the fifth degree in descent from a common ancestor on the mother&rsquo;s side and 7th in descent from the father&rsquo;s side ; or three on the mother&rsquo;s side and five on the father&rsquo;s side. 8100 This latter portion about three and five degrees has now been accepted by the Indian Parliament (excepting customs to the contrary) in the Hindu Marriage Act No. 25 of 1955, Section 3 (f).</p>

When an appointed daughter dies her husband does not succeed to her wealth; if she dies sonless, her wealth should be taken by her unmarried daughter or sister. On pp. 818 and 819, there are two prose passages, the first providing for the status of the children of a brāhmana, ksatriya or Vaisya woman born from a person of a lower varna and the second providing for the status of children born in unions (which are not bad on the ground of illicit inter course ). The Brahmacárikānda of the Kalpataru quotes 22 prose pasgages and seven verses from Paithīnasi. Kalpataru ( Moksakānda pp. 21-22 ) has a long sutra of Paithīnasi about the daily life of a forest hermit (vānaprastha ). Kalpataru (on Srāddha ) adduces prose passages of Paithīnasi fifteen times and only two verses. Kalpataru (on Suddhi) adduces from Paithinasi only prose passages ( 15 times ), some (as op pp. 105 and 140 ) being very long.

In both Mit. and Aparārka there are passages in prose and verse ascribed to Pracetas on daily duties, srāddha, āśauca, prāyascitta. The Mit. (on Yāj. III. 27 ) quotes &amp; verse from Pracetas saying that workmen, artisans, physicians, male and female slaves, kings, royal officers have not to observe periods of impurity 811 (on death). This verse is cited as a smrti by Medhātithi on Manu V. 60 without ascribing it to Pracetas. So Medhätithi looked upon Pracetas as equally authoritative with Manu, Višņu and others.</p>

<p>It appears from the quotations in the Mit., Aparārka and Smrticandrikā that they had before them a large work of Pracetas containing sūtras and verses and that Pracetas did not deal with Vyavahāra. An example of a long prose passage is cited below.613</p>
<p>The Mit. on Yāj.

III. 265 and Aparărka (on pp.888,) 897 and 1098 ) quote several verses of Vĩddha-Pracetas on the same topics.</p>

<li>Prajapati Prajāpati is cited as an authority by the Baudhāyana dharinasūtra (II. 4. 15 and II. 10. 71 ). Vasistha several times quotes Prājāpatya blokas (viz. III. 47, XIV. 16-19, 24-27, 30-32). It has been shown above that most of these Verses are found in the Manusmrti or have close correspon dence with verses of Manu. So it is not unlikely that both the writers of dharmasūtras mean Manu by Prajāpati.</li>

<p>In the Anandāśrama collection (p. 90-98 ) there is a smrti of Prajāpati in 198 verses on the various details of frāddha, such as the time, place, the persons authorised to perform, proper food, Brāhmanas to be invited etc. The pre vailing metre is Auustubh, but there are nine verses in the Indravajrā, Upajäti, Vasantatilakā (verse 137 ) and Sragdhară (verse 96 ). It speaks of Kalpaśāstra, smrtis, dharmaśāstra, purānas. It contains a verse referring to the Kanya and Vrścika ( scorpion ) signs of the Zodiac, which is almost the same as a verse of Kāršņājini.</p>

<p>The Mit. (on Yāj. III. 25 and 260 ) quotes verses of Prajā pati on āśauca and prāyaścittu. Aparārka cites verses of Prajāpati on purification of various substances, on érāddha, witnesses, ordeals and āśauca. None of these is traced to the printed text of Prajāpati. A parārka (p. 952 ) gives a long prose text of Prajāpati on the four orders of parivrājakas, viz. kuticaka, bahudaka, hamsa, paramahamsa. Aparārka (p. 542) cites a verge of Laugākṣi which refers to the view of Prajā pati that the son of a putrika was to offer pindas to his mother by the gotra of his maternal grand-father.s13 Aparārka, Smrti. candrikā, Parāśara-Mădhaviya and other works quote several verses of Prajāpati on vyavahāra. Wituesses are of two kinds, krta and akrta.814 In this he seems to have followed Narada (rnadana, verse 149). Prajapati lays down the characteri stics of valid reply ( uttara ) of the defendant and defines 818 the four varieties of uttara. The Parāśara-Madhaviya cites several verses of Prajāpati on ordeals. Prajāpati recognised the right of the sonless widow to succeed to her husband&rsquo;s wealth018 and enjoined on her the duty of offering frāddha every month and year to her husband&rsquo;s manes and to honour his relatives.817</p>

<p>verses are found in both, e. g. the verses about the seven lowest casteg625 ( antyajas ). Verse 11 quotes the view of Sātātapa. This Smộti contains the well-known text that * woman passes on marriage into the gotra of her husband, which is cited by the Mit. (on Yaj. I. 254 ).828 In the same collection there is a smộti of Bịhad-Yama (pp. 99-107 ). It is divided into five chapters and contains 182 verses. It deals with prāyaścittas for various lapses, purification from various kinds of contacts (suddhi), srāddha, partition and a few matters of medical procedure. In this suști Yama is frequently cited by name. Sätātapa is cited on partition ( V. 20). Many of the verses of this text are identical with those of Yama in Jivananda&rsquo;s text. For example, Jivananda (p. 561 ) verses 15-17 are the same as Brbad-Yama III. 1-3, Jivananda p. 563 verses 29-33 are the same as Brhad-Yama III. 34-38, Jivananda verses 35-36 are the same as Brhad-Yama III. 16–17. The verse in the Upajāti metre, Jivananda 44 ) is Brhad-Yama III. 61. Two of the verses at the end of chap. V. are the same as Yāj. II. 17 and 23.</p>
<p>The pumerous m88. of Yama contain either one or other of the above three texts or different texts bearing on the same topics. For example, the Govt. Mos. Collection at the Bhandarkar Institute, Nos. 209-211 of A 1881-82 and No. 153 of 1895-1902 are the same as the Yamasmrti in the Anandā srama collection. No. 401 of 1891-95 seems to be the same as Brhad-Yama in the Anandásrama collection. But the I. O. Cat. No. 1334 p. 390 contains 37 slokas, the last 20 of which are in the Indravajrā metre.</p>
<p>Visvarūpa, Vijñāneśvara, Aparārka, the Smộticandrikā and other later works quote over three hundred verses of Yama on all topics of dharmaśāstra including vyavahāra. This establishes that they had an extensive work of Yama before them from which it is probable that various abridgments corresponding with the printed works were made. Visvarūpa quotes about ten verses of Yama on water as purifier (on Yāj.</p>

<p>1, 187 ), on srāddha ( on Yāj. I 225 and 252 ) and on prāya. scitta for killing a cow (on Yaj. III. 262). The identical verses are not found in the printed texts. Some of the verses quoted from Yama in Aparārka and the Smộticandrikā can be traced in the printed text. For example, Aparārka (p. 42 ) quotes a verse of Yama in which Yama himself is referred to as an authority.sa7 It occurs in Jivananda&rsquo;s text (verse 65 ). The two verses in Jivananda&rsquo;s text ( verses 26, 28) that are identical with Manu are cited in the Smộticandrikā 88 Yama&rsquo;s. Aparārka p. 1135 quotes a prose passage of Yama, यमः- वृक्षलतागुल्मछेदने वृद्धकृच्छकः फलवतां प्राजापत्यम् :- Two verses of Brhad-Yama ( III. 20-21 ) about the proper age of marriage in the case of girls are quoted as Yama&rsquo;s in the Smrti. candriká.628 In some of the verses quoted by Aparārka from Yama, the opinions of Manu are cited which can be identified with the views of the Manusmrti. For example, according to Yama food polluted by the touch of hair, moths and insects, or seen by sinners and women in their courses is purified by water, holy ashes etc.628 This refers to Manu V, 125. Similarly, the Smộticandrikā quotes a verse of Yama which says that according to Manu those who administer poison, who are incendiaries and robbers and those guilty of homicide and abetment thereof should pay the extreme penalty of death.630 Aparārka (p. 988 on Yaj. III. 109) quotes five verses of Yama which refer to the 26 tattvas well-known in the Sankhya system, regard Purusottama as a 26th tuttva and propound that he who correctly understands the 25 tattvas, in whatever aśrama he may be, reaches the highest abode of Viņņu. Aparārka quotes a few prose passages from Yama on the garments to be worn by brahmacãrins,831 on prāyascitta</p>

<p>The Anulisanaparva of the Mahābhārata (Chap. 104 verse 72 ) states that those who are conversant with ancient times recited verses (gūthūs ) of Yama and then follow 84 verses which are more or less like verses found in several smrtis e. g. the verse &lsquo;ürdhyam prānā&hellip; pratipadyate&rsquo; occurs as Anušāsana 104. 64-65 (and is Manu II. 120 ); so also</p>
<p>Dūrādāvasathān ..düre kāryam hitaisinā&rsquo;. This is Apušāsana 104.82 (Manu IV. 151). The verge Acārāllabhate hyāyur-ācăro hantyalaksanam&rsquo; ( Anu. 104. 155 ) occurs in Manu IV. 156. It is possible that the final redactor of the Mahabhārata had before him a Smrti ascribed to Yama or it is likely that a few verses ascribed to Yama were first cited and the author of the Epic added a few more from other sources. Yams is pro fusely quoted in the various Kändas of Kalpataru.</p>
<p>The Smộticandriká quotes a verse of Yama which speaks of the Sun being in the zodiacal sign Virgo.638</p>
<p>Yama required the king to look into the disputes of liti gants carefully and impartially.834 Yama cites the authority of Manu for the proposition that everything brought about by coercion such as a gift or a deed was liable to be set aside.685 This is almost identical with Manu 8. 168. Yama lays down that a Brāhmana was never to be awarded corporal punish ment, but that a Brāhmana guilty of crimes was to be impri soned and made638 to work. Yama like Yaj. (II. 145 ), pre scribed that the stridhana of a woman married in the Asura</p>

Aparārka (p. 822 ) quotes two verses of Yama that prescribed the first ammercement for him who, though forbidden, wrongfully takes the water of a lake or disturbs a water-courge and the highest ommercement for him who breaks a lake. Aparārka (p. 860 ) also cites Yama for the fine of five krsnalas in the case of adultery with another&rsquo;s wife of the same caste as that of the paramour and twelve panjas in case the wife is of a lower caste. The Smrticandrika and the Vyavaharamayūkba on the other hand direct that the king should punish the Brāhmana woman guilty of adultery with a Sūdra by throwing her to dogs and by forcible tonsure and riding on an ass in case of adultery with a Kiatriya or Vaibya. The Smrticandrikā, Parāsara-Mădhaviya and Vyavahāramayukha quote a verse of Yome about a debtor, who, being able to pay, does not want only pay, being punished by taking twice the amount. Yama remarks that the order of Saṁnyåsa is not allowed to women in the Vedas or in the sāstra 38 (dharmadāstra ) and that her real dharma is to be the mother of children from one of her own caste.</p>
<p>Verses of Bșhadyama are cited 098 by the Mit. on Yāj. III. 255, 260, 289 and by Aparārka, who, on p. 496, quotes also from Laghuyama a verse and a half.</p>

<p>Laugākşi is mentioned among the 36 expounders of Dharmaśāstra set out by Paithīnasi (on p. 1 of Smộ. Ch.) and Angiras quoted on the same page includes Laugākşi among Upasmộtis.</p>
<p>The Mit. (on Yāj. III, 1-2, 260, 289 ) quotes verses of Laugāksi on āśauca and prāyascitta. Aparārka quotes nine proge passages (pp. 28–29, 33, 122, 145, 166, 176 and 530) on Ācāra including Srāddha and ten verses on ten pages on Acāra, Āśauca and the order of forest hermits and one very long prose passage on p. 1227 (covering half a page ). On p. 542 Aparārka quotes a verse of Laugāksi in which Prajāpati is mentioned as an authority. The Mit. on Yāj. II. 118-119 quotes the definitions of Yoga&rsquo;and Ksema given by Laugākşi and which are declared to be not liable to partition by coparceners ( acc. to Mapu IX. 219 ), even if they be acqui red by detriment to the parental estate. Those definitions of Yoga and Kşema are quoted by many works and writers on Vyavahāra such as the Smộticandrikā (on Vy. p. 277 ), Par. M. Vol. III. p. 563. Vide H. of Dh. Vol. III. pp. 588-589 for different meanings of the two words.</p>
<p>It is remarkable that Aparārka quotes from Lauvākši prose and verse passages ten times each. On pp. 1821938, a long prose passage of Laugākşi is quoted about Kūdo mandar homa ( for which see H, of Dh. vol. IV p. 43 n. 102). FOUNDED</p>

Maskarin quotes verses of Lokāksi on Gaut. 14. 1, 15. 1; 22, 18 ( three verses on prāyaścittas for killing a person of pratiloma caste and others also).

<li>Visvamitra Vievāmitra is one of the writers on dharma enumerated by Vrddha-Yājījavalkya as quoted by Visvarūpa. Aparárka, the Smộticandrikā, the Kālaviveka of Jimūtavāhana and other works quote verses of Viśvāmitra on almost all topics of dharma except vyavahāra, such as on the five deadly sins, on srāddhas, prāyaścitta etc. Viśvāmitra defines dharma as that which is esteemed by Aryas ( respectable people who know the Vedas. 640 Aparárka quotes 18 verses from Visvā. mitra on Prayascitta and the Sinrticandrikā also quotes several verses of his Kalpataru ( on Brahmacario), cites Yāj. I. 14 (Garbhāstame &amp;c.) as occurring in Viśvāmitra also. Similarly Kalpataru (on Naiyatakāla p. 314 ) states that Yāj. I. 179 (prānātyaye &amp;c. ) also occurs in Visvāmitra&rsquo;s Smộti.

<p>Visvarūpa quotes a few verses of Vyāsa. They are mostly taken from the Mahābhārata and are concerned with topics of marriage, daily duties (such as washing the teeth and bathing ), srāddha and prāyascitta. Similarly Medhătithi quotes several verses from the Mahābharata as Vyasa&rsquo;s. Kalpataru quotes Vyāga about 80 times ou Vyavahāra, 16 times in Grhastha, 3 times on Rājadharma. Višvarūpa on Yaj. II. 121 ( part 2, p. 121 ) quotes three verses of Vyasa on theft, the 2nd and 3rd of which say &lsquo;on acquiring by theft one suvarna, one cow or even one fingerbreadth of land from the best of brāhmaṇas (the thief ) certainly receives bodily punishment&rsquo; (or death sentence ); and &lsquo;by gift or theft the reward ( or result ) is middling or lowest or highest, depend ing on the extent of the thing donated and the worth of the donee&rsquo;.

Vyāsa refers to the opinion of some that one should not marry a girl of the same gotra as that of one&rsquo;s mother (in her maiden state ). Yyäsa and Bșhaspati provide that aged parents, a virtuous wife and a son who is e child must be given maintenance even by taking to conde mned means of livelihood. A brāhmana should not hanker after gifts; he may collect them only for his livelihood; a brāh mana taking more than what is required for his maintenance incurs degradation. In Aparărka, the Smộticandrikā and other works about two hundred verses of Vyāsa are cited on vyavahāra. From these it appears that Vyāsa dealt with rules of procedure and the several titles of law ( vyavahāra-padas ) and that his doctrines closely agreed in most respects with those of Nārada, Kātya yana and Bșhaspati. He gives rules on the four kinds of uttara (mithyā, sampratipatti, kārana and prān-nyaya ), divides documents into three varieties ( svahasta, janapada, rājaśāsana ), divides laukiku documents into eight sub varieties ( just as Kātyāyana seems to have done ); Yāj. (1. 316-318 ) provides that when a king makes a grant of land or of a permanent right to receive a certain sum of money or a certain part of goods, he should inscribe on a piece of cloth or on a copper plate the details of the grant with his seal. Byhaspati (four verses quoted by Aparärka on pp. 579-580 ) deals more elaborately with the same matter and Aparārka quotes about eight verses of Vyāsa, one of which prescribes that the grant should record in it the merit for the grantor and his successors who continue the grant, and heaven for 60000 years, and hell for the same length</p>

<p>of time for him who resumes it.646 Vyāsa lays down that if &amp; stranger enjoys a person&rsquo;s land for twenty years when the king i is there (i. e. when there is no revolution or anarchy) and when the owner is able (to resist) the latter loses his property.848 He speaks of adverse possession as having five characteristics.s47 He mentions seven kinds of sureties, wbile Harita and Kätyāyana speak of only five and Bșhaspati of four. He speaks of only five kinds of ordeals. He defines a niska as equal to 14 suvarnas, a suvarna being equal to eight palas.843 Vyasa seems to represent a middle stage in the evolution of the rights of the widow to succeed to her deceased husband. He says that a woman was to get a maximum of two thousand (kārsāpanas) from the estate of her deceased husband.648 (besides what he gave her when living ). Vyasa gave to the father and sons equal share in ancestral property and allowed partition even against the wish of the father.660 From these important characteristics of Vyāsa it may safely be concluded that Vyasa flourished about the same time as Yajňavalkya and Bșhaspati, i. e. between the second and the fifth century (A. D. ).</p>

Similarly, Vyāsa&rsquo;s verses dealing with the merit of bathing on Sunday, Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday in conjunction with certain tithis are cited by Aparårka (p. 213). Vyāsa a peuks of srādthas when the Sun is in the sign of Viryo ( A pararka p. 424). These indications are sufficient to assign Vyása to a comparatively later date. But, as Aparārka evidently makes no distinction between Vyasa the jurist, Vyāsa, the reputed compiler of the Mahabharata (e. g. he quotes on p. 961 six verses of the Bhagavadgiti as Vyasa&rsquo;s) and Vyäsa who wrote on the sams kāras, fräddha and other topics, it appears that the jurist and the writer on other topics of dharma were separated from him by several centuries. Whether the jurist and the writer on other topics of dharma are identical is a difficult problem. The Mit. also appears to identify Vyāsa of the Maha bbārata with the jurist. For example, on Yûj. III. 253 it refers to &lsquo;Ublau Madhvāsa&rsquo;s ( Udyoya parva 58. 5 ) applied to Krona and Arjuna and explains that all intoxicants were not forbidden to Ksatriyas but only wine prepared from tour. The Mit. on Yāj. II. 283 ( on &lsquo;Strisangrahaya&rsquo;) quotes three verses and a half on the three kinds of that juridical topic. No one has so far identified these verses in the Mahābhārata. The Mit. appears to make no distinction between the two. The Kalpataru (on Vy. pp. 577-579 ) quotes with slight vari. ations the same verses and also sets forth similar verses of Bphaspati. Aparārka (pp. 854-55 ) and Smộticandrikå (Vy. p. 8) also quote the same verses as Vyäsa&rsquo;s (with slight variations. ). All that can be said is that the two may probably be identical. The Smộticandrikā quotes a Gadya Vyága 661 and quotes about 450 verses of Vyäsa on âhnika, vyavabăra and prayascitta.</p>

<p>History of Dharmaśāstra</p>
<p>The Smộticandrikā652 quotes several interesting verses of Laghu-Vyāsa that condemn somewhat severely and unchari tably the memorizing of the Veda without understanding the meaning. A few verses are quoted below. It may be noted that the Nirukta I. 18 ( several centuries before Christ ), by quoting a verse &lsquo;a man who memorizes the Veda but does not know the meaning is like a stump of a tree, a mere carrier of a burden&rsquo;condemned mere learning of the Veda by heart in very similar words (Sthāņur-ayam bhārahāraḥ kilābhūt &amp;c.) Daksa (in II. 34 ) states that the study of Veda has five aspects viz. first to commit it to memory, then to think over its meaning, then to repeat it often, its japa and to pass it on to pupils.</p>
<p>Aparārka quotes a verge of Vțddha-Vyāsa on Saudāyika, a kind of strīdhana. The Mit., the Prāyaścitta&ndash;mayūkha and other works cite verses of a Brhad-Vyāsa. Ballălasena in his Dānasāgara quotes Mabā- Vyāsa and Lagbu-Vyāsa as authorities and also Dāna-Vyāsa, which probably means the dāna-dharma portions of the Mahābhārata.</p>
<p>Dr. Batakrishua Ghosh collected from fourteen works (such as Aparārka&rsquo;s commentary, Mitākṣarā, Dāyabhāga, Parāśaramadhaviya, Smộticandrikā, Vyavahāramātņkā, Vya vahāramayukha &amp;c.) 268 verses of Vyāsa on judicial procedure and the substantive law and published them in Indian Culture&rsquo; Vol. IX. pp. 65-98 ( with references at the bottom of the pages).

<p>Mitākṣarā are prose passages on Yāj. III. 265 and about 23 verses on the third section of Yāj. Smrti and Aparārka also has one prose passage on p. 1196 and about 37 verses on two sections viz. ācāra and prāycscitta. Both these digests cite no passage of the Sat-trimsan-mata on Vyavahāra. It appears that the Kalpataru was aware of the existence of this work but regarded it as unauthoritative, since it was accepted only by a few and was contradicted by others, as stated in the Brahmacárikānda of Kalpataru (p. 26).666 The prose quotation in the Mit. on Yāj. III. 265 from the Șat-trimsan-mata is a long one and provides the penances for adultery by a woman of the four varnas with a male of a varna different from each of them. Aparārka quotes a prose passage (on p. 1196 ) from this work which provides a penance for touching the corpse of a cāņdāla or for occupying the same vehicle, seat or bed with the latter.</p>
<p>The fact that Visvarūpa and Medhătithi do not mention this work, taken along with the above statement of Mitramisra may be relied upon for holding that this compilation must have been among the latest products of the age of smộtis and was probably compilerl some time between 790-909 A.

<p>History of Dharmaśāstra</p>
<p>portant for the history of Hindu Law. A few of the important views of the Samgrabakāra are set out below. He gives the requisite characteristics of a plaint in five verses.662 Accord ing to him documents are of two kinds, rājakiya and jāna pada. The ordeals from dhata (balance) to poison (i. e, four) are prescribed in cases where the subject matter is of great value (i. e. above 500 panas ), while kośa and the other ) ordeals (in all three ) are prescribed in disputes for lesser sums.868 This is slightly opposed to Nārada (rnādāna, verse 336 ), according to whom the five ordeals from tula to kosa were prescribed in substantial disputes. The Samgrahakära has in view the seven ordeals spoken of by Närada (rņādāna verses 252, 337, 343 ), while Bșhaspati and Pitāmala enumerate nine. He defines dāya as the wealth that is handed down through father and mother. 864 He held that ownership arose from the dictates of śāstra and was not an affair of the world (laukika) and puts forward two reasons in support of his theory, viz. if ownership were laukika, then it would not be possible to make such assertions as his wealth has been wrong-fully seized by another and the texts (vide Gautama X. 49 ) laying down the means of acquisition of wealth for the several varyas would be meaningless.686 Dbireśvara held the same view. These views were elaborately criticized by the Mit. According to the Samgrahakära, 666 partition creates ownership in the son as regards paterual wealth ( in which he has no rights by birth ). Dhāreśvara entertained the game opinion, which was vehemently controverted by the Mit. holding that partition takes place of that in which one has already ownership.</p>

<p>According to the Samgraha,867 ownership does not consist in being able to dispose of a thing at one&rsquo;s sweet will, since it is the sāstra that prescribes the proper disposal or application of all things. The Samgraba$68 laid down that the special share given to the eldest son, the practice of niyoga and the offering of a cow are all forbidden in the present age. Dhāre svara also held the same view about the eldest son&rsquo;s rights and the Mit. also approves of it and quotes anonymously the same verse (on Yaj. II. 117 ). The Saṁgraha in two verses appa rently following Manu 9. 182-183, lays down that, if of several full brothers one has a son, all thereby have issue and that, if one out of the several wives of a person has a son, all the co-wives may be regarded as putruvati. The Smộti candrikā says that Devasvami explained this dictum of the Samgrahakära (Smộticandrikā, Vy. p. 289). The Samgraha says that the widow of a separated coparcener dying childless would inberit his whole estate if she submitted to Niyoga at the behests of her elders.968 This was also the opinion of Dhare svara and was refuted according to the Smộticandrikā by Visva. rūpa. The Mit. also criticizes this view. He names Manu in con nection with the succession of a person dying without leaving any one out of the twelve kinds of sons.670 He has in view Manu 9. 185. According to the Sangrahakāra the order of succession to a sonless man is :&ndash; widow, the daughter who is a putrikā, mother, paternal grandmother, father, full brothers, half-brothers, the line of the father (pitssantati ), the grandfather&rsquo;s line, the great-grand-father&rsquo;s line, other sapindas, sakulyas, the preceptor, the pupil, a fellow-student,</p>

<p>a learned Brāhmaṇa. The Mit. notes that relying on Mann (9.217) Dhāreśvara placed the paternal grandmother after the mother and before the father (tbus agreeing with the Samgraha). The Sangraha says that homicide and other offences when committed with force are called sūhasa. 871</p>
<p>It will be seen from the above that the views of the Sam grahakāra closely agreed with those of Dhāreśvara in many respects and were not approved of by the Mit. and other later writers. In vyuvahāra the Samgraha certainly marks a far more advanced stage than Yājñavalkyal and Nārada, whose works do not contain the controversial questions about ownership, partition etc. As Dhåreśvara agrees very closely with the Smrtisamgraha it may be argued that they were not separated by a long interval of time. It has to be also noted that Visvarūpa and Medhitithi do not refer to the Samgraba. It is not unlikely that the Sangraha was in vogue in the territory ruled over by Bhoja of Dhirū und was therefore followed by Bhoja Dhäreśvaris. Taking all things into con sideration the Sangraha was probably compiled between the 8th and 10th centuries of the Christian era. The Smrti candrikā no doubt says in one place that the Samgrahakāra follows the views of Dhüreśvara.978 But this statement should not be einphasized and interpreted too literally. All that it means is that both held the same opinion. There is no intention to state that Dhåreśvari preceded the Samyraha kāra. Chronology was never the strong point of Indian commentators, particularly when the writers whose opinions were referred to flourished several centuries earlier. We know that Bharuci and Dhüreśvara preceded the Mitāksarā which names both; but the Sarasvativilăsa in several places (e. g. pp. 347, 361, 383 ) says that Bharuci cannot tolerate the view of Vijñāneśvara and also says that Dhāreśvara and Devas vāmi follow the view of Vijñānayogin (1) 395 ).</p>

The pāda of Saṁvarta which Visvarūpa quotes (ardhāstamitabhāskarām) on Yāj. I. 25 occurs in verse 6 of the printed text. This shows that the printed smộti preserves very ancient material, the authenticity of which is vouched for by so early a writer as Visvarūpa.</p>

<p>The literature on Dharmaśāstra falls into three well marked but somewhat over-lapping periods. The first period is that of the ancient dharmasūtras and of the Manusmrti. It is a period dating from at least the 6th century B. C. to the beginnings of the Christian era. Next comes the period when most of the versified smrtis were composed and it ranges from the first centuries of the Christian era to about 800 A. D. The third period is that of the commentators and the writers of digests. This covers over a thousand years from about the 7th century to 1800 A. D. The first part of this last period was the golden era of famous commentators. Commentaries on smrti works continued to be written almost to the end of this period, e. g. Nandapandita wrote the commentary called Vaijayanti on the Visnudharmasūtra in the 17th century. But the general tendency from the 12th century onwards was</p>

<p>to write works not professing to be commentaries on a parti cular smộti, but works that were in the nature of digests containing a synthesis of all the dicta of smrti writers on topics of dharma. Examples of this class of works are the Kalpataru, the Smộticandrikā, the Caturvargacintāmaņi, the Ratnākaras of Candeśvara. Even when in the earlier part of this period writers professed to compose only commentaries on particular works, they adopted the style of digests trying to introduce order out of a chaotic mass of Smrti dicta and explaining away apparent contradictions. For example, Visvarūpa&rsquo;s commentary (in the ācāra and prāyaścitta sec tions ), the Mitāksarā and Aparārka&rsquo;s work, though professing to be commentaries on Yājšavalkya, are really in the nature of digests. In fact there is no hard and fast line of demarca tion between a tikā and a nibandha ( digest). Vijñānesvara is described by the Dvaitanirnaya of Sankara bhatta as the most eminent of all writers of ribandha8.. Therefore, though it is usual to speak of the third period as one of commenta tors and nibandhakāras, there is no necessity in this work to observe any sharp line of distinction between the two. In the following pages a few prominent and typical commentators and nibandhakāras who have written on all or most of the branches of dharmaśāstra and whose works have attained classical rank will be dealt with in chronological order as far as that can be done with any accuracy.</p>

<p>Dr. Jolly in his edition of the Nāradasmrti (B. I. series ) bas incorporated a portion of the bhāsya of Asahāya as re vised by Kalyānabhatta. Even this revised version comes up to only verse 21 of the fifth title abhyupetya-asuśrūşā. The exact relation of Kalyānabhatta&rsquo;s labours to the original bhāsya cannot be accurately gauged from the opening888 words ' finding that the Náradathäsya composed by Asahāya was spoilt (bhrasta ) by bad scribes, Kalyāṇa composes this after revising the ancient one&rsquo;. The colophon at the end of the first chapter of the Vyavahāramātýkä says that Kalyānabhatta</p>

<p>revised the bhāsya of Asahāya at the encouragement of Keśava bhatta.890 Kalyāna bhatta seems to have takeu great liberties with the text of the original bhāsya. On p. 9 verse 15.( rājā satpurusaḥ sabhyah sāstram gana kalekhakau ), the comment on sastra is · Manu-Narada - Visvarūpātmakam'. If Visvarūpa named here be identical with the Visvarūpa who commented on Yāj. (as is alunost certain ), this passage could not have occurred in Asahāya&rsquo;s bhāsya. Višvarūpa, in commenting on Yāj. III. 263-64, mevtions Asahāya by name and cites his explanation of a sútra of Gautama (22. 13). The name Kalyanabhatta frequently occurs in the printed commentary itself (p. 81, 86, 89 ).801</p>
<p>In the I. 0. ms, there is a salutation to śiva and Ganesa at the beginning. There is a ns. of the Náradiyabhāsya as printed by Dr. Jolly in the Govt. Mss. Library at the B. O. R. Institute, Poona, ( No. 72 of 1874-75). It does not contain the first folio and curiously enough it ends just where the printed text stops. Dr. Jolly omits a few lengthy passages occurring in the ms. and generally indicates such omissions by dots. In a few cases Dr. Jolly omits only a word or two for no apparent reason, e. g. on p. 8 ( folio 7b of No. 27 of 1874-75 ) he omits the word &lsquo;paramasamrudhyā&rsquo; after</p>
<p>vyavahārah' and before &lsquo;caturņām-api varṇānām&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The Kalpataru (on Moksa pp. 48-49 ) quotes Gautama Dh. S. III. 10-24 from &lsquo;Anicayo bhiksuh&rsquo; to · Anārambhi' and cites the explanations of Bhartryajña, Asahāya and Maskarin on some words occurring in them. Maskarin is a well-known commentator on Gautama ( the com. is printed ). It seems that Bhatryajña and Asahāya also composed com mentaries ; vide ABORI Vol. 18 p. 205 where Prof. Raghavan draws attention to Asahaya&rsquo;s commentary on Sankba-Likhita mentioned by Anandagiri. On p. 544 the Vivādaratnākara quotes Manu IX. 165 ( Aurasuksetrajau ) and Asahācārya&rsquo;s explanation thereon.</p>

<p>History of Dharmaśāstra</p>
<p>The Hāralatā of Aniruddha who was the guru of king Ballālasena of Bengal, the author of Adbhutasāgara ( about 1168 A. D.), tells us that Asahāya composed a bhāsya on the Gautamadharmasutra.se Visvarupa also cites, as said above, Asahāya’s explanation of a sūtra of Gautama.</p>
<p>It appears that Asahāya probably wrote a commentary on the Manusmrti also. A passage of the Sarasvativilāsadis says that partition of dharma was approved of by smrtikāras like Manu, Yājšavalkya, by their commentators, viz. Asahāya, Medhātithi, Vijñānesvara and Aparārka and by writers of nibandh«18, viz. the author of the Candrikū and others. Here the order in which the commentators are named requires that Asahāya like Medhitithi was known to be a commentator of Manu. This conclusion is to some extent corroborated by the fact that the Vivādaratnākaragot quotes with reference to</p>

<p>Manu 9. 182 the words of Asahāya thereon. On Manu 8. 156 Medhātithi quotes the opinion of Asahāya.695 Manu VIII. 155 in in Mandlik&rsquo;s edition.</p>
<p>The foregoing establishes that Asahāya composed bhāsyas on the Gautamadharmasūtra, on the Manusmrti and on Nārada. When the Smrticandrikā898 refers to a bhāsya of Nārada it is most probably referring to Asahaya. In the Mit. (on Yāj. II. 124 ) the opinion of Asahāya and Medhătithi on the right of an unmarried sister to receive one-fourth as pro vision for her marriuge from her brothers is preferred to that of Bhāruci.097 This seems to be rather a reference to Asahāya&rsquo;s commentary on Manu (9. 118 ) which contains a rule similar to Yāj. (II. 12+ ), while Nārada contains no such rule about a fourth share. It is a strange irony of fate that the very name of Asahiya who is profusely quoted by the Sarasvatīvilāsa in the first half of the sixteenth century was forgotten by later writers, so much so that the Bālambhatti understands the word Asahaya ( in note 515 above ) as an attribute of Medhā tithi in the sense of peerless'.</p>
<p>As Visvarūpa and Medhätithi both name Asahāya, his lowest limit is about 750 A. D. How much earlier he flourish ed it is difficult to say. He can hardly be earlier than the 6th century. In the com. on Nārada (p. 48 ) there is a story from Pataliputra about the repayment of a debt by sons, grandsons and great-grandsons. It has been argued ( Calcutta Law Journal, vol. 17 p. 59 ) that, as Pataliputra was a desert ed city in the middle of the 7th century and as the reference shows that Pūtaliputra was a living and flourishing city, Asabāya must have lived long before the 7th century. But as the very authenticity of the text of the bhāsya is doubtful owing to the drastic &lsquo;revision&rsquo; of Kalyānabhatta, such a con clusion is extremely hazardous. In the ms. of the bbāsya</p>

<p>other places such as Vatapadraka ( probably modern Baroda ), Avāvadu and Samvāduka are mentioned. There is nothing to show that the author was either a native of or had a first hand knowledge of Pataliputra. He might have been relying on traditions when he gave the story. Dr. Jolly not being aware of the express mention of Asahāya by Medhătithi argued that he flourished earlier than Medhātithi ( Tagore Law Lectures p. 5; S. B. E. vol. 25 p. VII) on the ground that the Mit. and the Sarasvativilāsa always place Asahāya before Medhătithi whenever authorities on vyavahāra are enumerat ed. Dr. Jolly&rsquo;s conclusion is right as shown above, but his reasoning is faulty. There is hardly anything of chronology in the order in which authors are named, since we find that the Sarasvativilása 688 names Vijñāneśvara even before Asahāya though the former flourished centuries after the latter.</p>
<p>Some of the views attributed to Asahāya may be quoted here. The definition of dūya ( heritage ) given by the Mit. was identical with Asahāya&rsquo;s.689 Asahāya explained the dic tum of Uśanas that fields were impartible by taking it to refer to the son of a brāhmana from a ksatriya wife, who does not participate in land gifted to a Brāhmana.700 The Mit. on Yaj. II. 119 takes the same view. Asahāya held that as regards succession to the sullca of a woman even step-brothers should be given something, though the major portion would go to the full brothers.701 According to Asahāya, the wealth of a child less brāhmana went to the teacher, then to the teacher&rsquo;s son, then to the teacher&rsquo;s widow, the pupil, pupil&rsquo;s son, pupil&rsquo;s widow (oue after another) and then to the fellow-student.&ldquo;02</p>

<p>The Vivādaratnākara 03 (p. 578 ) quotes the Prakāśa as refer ring to the views of Asahāya and Medhātithi on Manu IX. 198 that the special rule of Manu applies to all the stridhana belonging to a Ksatriya woman who has a brāhmani co-wife. The Vivādaratnākara704 quotes a verse of Nārada about māsa and a verse of the blāsyakāra thereon. It probably refers to Asahāya&rsquo;s bhāsya.</p>
<p>| áo. Bharteyajĩa This seems to have been a very ancient commentator. Medhatithiros in his bhāsya on Manu 8. 3 says &lsquo;other explana tions have been well brought out by Bhartļyajña and they should be understood from his work&rsquo;. Trikānda-mandana (who flourished before 1100 A. D.) in his Āpastambasūtra dhvanitārtha-kāriki708 (I. 41) refers to the views of Bhartr yajña that one who had committed to memory the text of the Veda had the privilege ( the adhikāra ) of consecrating the sacred fires, though he may be innocent of the meaning of the Vedic texts. From Ananta&rsquo;s bhâsya it appears that Bhartryajña composed a bhāsya on the KĀtyāyanaśrautasūtra which had been lost (autsanna) in the former&rsquo;s day. From Gadūdhara&rsquo;s comments on the Paraskaragrhyasūtra it appears that Bhartryajña commented on Päraskara,707 The Grhastha ratnākara of Candeśvara quotes Bhartsyajña’s explanation of</p>

I. series ) after quoting Gautamadharma sūtra (11. 29 varnāšramāh svadharmanisthāh &amp;c. ) cites the comment of Bhartryajña700 on the word tac-chesenu occurring in that sūtra. Therefore it appears probable that Bhartr. yajña like Asahāya was an ancient commentator of the Gautamadharmasūtra. The Grhastharatnākara, after quoting from Vasistha (17. 1 ) and Visnu the well-known verse of the Aitareya-brāhmana (mnam-asmin sam-nayati) cites the ex planation of Bhartryajžia as to the word “jātasya' occurring therein. 710</p>
<p>The Kalpataru (on Brahmacārio p. 15 ) quotes the expla nation of the words &lsquo;tataḥ seșena&rsquo; and also on p. 144 quotes the explanation of Manu V. 143 (ucchistena tu &amp;c. ) given by Visvarīpa and Bhartsyajña. Kalpao (Suddhikānda p. 101 ) quotes Gaut. XIV. 35-40 and Bhartryajña&rsquo;s explanation of &lsquo;ante tvantyānānn&rsquo; as &lsquo;navamāśaucânte&rsquo;. Kalpataru (Gșhastha kānda p. 5) cites the explanation of Vas. Dh. S. VIII. 1 (Grhasthu&hellip;vindeta ) by Bhartryajña. Similarly, Kalpao (Gr. p. 259) quotes Gaut. X. 39 (Svāmī riktha-kraya&rdquo;) and cites the explanation of samvibhāya' as &lsquo;mitradāyu&rsquo; by Bhartryajña. Kalpao (Niyatakāla p. 256 ) cites Yāj. I. 166 (südrešu dāsa gopālao) and its explanation by Bhartryajña as &lsquo;yasya gāḥ pālayati tasyaiva bhojyānnah&rsquo;. Kalpao on Niyata p. 203 quotes Gaut. Dho. S. V. 41 and the explanation of the word &lsquo;adhivęksasürya&rsquo; by both Maskarin and Bhartryajña as meaning&rsquo;sāyamkāla' (evening). Vide an interesting paper by Prof. Baladera Upadhyaya in I. H. Q. vol. XII p. 494-503, where he advances some grounds for holding that Bhartr. yajña commented on the Paraskaragrhya and preceded even Karka. The Vyavahāranirnaya of Varadarāja (on p. 135) cites the view of Dhāreśvara, Asahāya and Srikara about the effect of not asserting one&rsquo;s right against an interloper for a long time and of Asahāya on pp. 230, 455 also.</p>

<p>Since Bhartryajña is quoted by Medhătithi who also men tions Asahāya but not Viśvarūpa, it follows that Bhartryajia must have flourished before 800 A. 1), and was probably &amp; contemporary of or slightly later than Asahāya.</p>

<li>Viśvarupa The commentary of Viśvarūpia called Bālakrīdā on the Yājsavalkya-smrti has been recently published in two parts by M. M. T. Ganapati Sāstri in the Trivandrum Sanskrit Series. The Mit. states in the introductory verses that the dicta of Yij. were expanded by the voluminous or ample (vikata ) explanations of Visvarüsra. In commenting on Yāj. 1. 81 the Mit. tells us that Visvarūjia looked upon the words of Yāj. I. 79 ( tasmin yugmāsu saṁviset ) as a niyama. In Visvarūpa&rsquo;s commentary on Yāj. I. 80 (evam gacchan &amp;c. ) we do find that the verse of Yāj. and similar passages of Manu (3. 45 ), Vasistha and Gautama ( 5. 1 ) are understood to contain a niyam and not a prescinkhyu.?!! On Yāj. III. 24 the Mit, inforins us that Visvarūpa, Medhatithi and Dhāre svara looked upon certain texts of Rsyasriiga on āściucu as in conflict with well-known sinitis and discarded them. Mr. S. Sitaram Sústri published (in 1900 at Madras ) the text and translation of Viśvarūpia&rsquo;s comment ou inheritance and Mr. Setlur also published the wavahürco section. In the following pages the Trivandrum edition is relied on.</li>

<p>The printed com. of Visvarūpa on the vyavaharu section is extreinely meagre and scarcely merits the epithet vikata applied to it by the Mit. But the commentary of Viśvarūpa on the ācāra and grīyascitta sections is truly voluminous and coinpares favourably with the Mit. The style of Visvarüpa is simple and forcible and resembles that of the great Sankarā. cārya. He quotes profusely from Vedic works, mentions the Carakas and Vājasaneyins (on Yaj 1. 32 ), the Kathaka (on Yaj. III. 237 and 243 ) and very often supports his position by quotatious from the Rgveda (e.g. on Yâj. 11. 121 and 206 ), the Brāhmanas (e. g. the Sata patha on Yāj. 1. 53 and III. 257 ) and from the Upanisads (e. g. on Yāj. 11. 117, the well-known</p>

He speaks of the pada-rātha and the kramapātha as due to human agency (on Yāj. III. 242). He frequently quotes the Grhya sūtrus of Pāraskara and less frequently those of Bhāradvāja and Asvalāyana. lle cites a host of smrtikāras.712 Most of the quotations attributed to Svayambhū are found in the extant Manusmrti, but this is not the case with the quotations ascribed to Bhrgu (vide pp. 309, 310 above). Most of the quota tions from Brhaspati (even on such topics as repayment of debts, sureties, the rights of sūdrāputra ) are in prose, only a few being in verse ( e. g. &amp; verse about ordeals on Yāj. II. 117, a verse about the method of partition on Yāj. II. 153 ). Ou Yāj. I. 307 Viśvarūpa quotes a long prose passage from Brbaspati in which the qualities required in a Senāpati, Pratihāra, Hastyadhyaksti, Asvādhyalist, Dūta, Mantrin and Uparika are set out at length. It appears, therefore, that Visvarūpa either knew a work of Brhaspati in prose on arthaśāstra in which occurred a few verses or he had before him a prose work of Bịhaspati and a versified smrti of Bịhaspati, both of which he regarded as the compositions of the same author. He quotes a verse (on Yāj. I. 328 ) from Visā lāksa, a well-known writer on politics quoted even by Kautilya. He refers to the arthaśāstra of Uśanas along with that of Bșhaspati. Kautilya is nowhere quoted by name. The learned editor of Visvarūpa thinks (Intro. p. V) that Vißve rúpa took Bịhaspati and Viśālākṣa as ārsa writers long anterior to Yāj. and therefore used their dictu to elucidate and support Yāj., while he omits Kautilya because he thought Kautilya to be posterior to Yāj. This argument contains several fallacies. In the first place it is wrong because Visva rūpa quotes verses from Nārada and Kätyāyana to supple ment Yāj. There is nothing to show that Visvarūpa regarded Nārada and Kātyāyana also as anterior to Yāj. and we have</p>

<p>seen above that they are several centuries later than the smrti of Yāj. Moreover Kautilya himself looked upon both Bphaspati and Viśālāksa as high authorities and so Visvarūpa might have quoted them rather than Kautilya. Even taking the latest date assigned to Kautilya (about 3rd century A.D.) he flourished several centuries before Visvarūpa. It is im possible to believe that Visvarüpa was in possession of the exact chronological relation of Yāj. and Kautilya. Many scholars, besides, place Kautilya&rsquo;s work centuries before Yāj. It appears, however, that Viśvarūpa had the work of Kautilya before him. On Yāj. I. 307 he speaks of ministers tested by the four allurements (upachii) of dharma, artha, kūma and bhaya. This is an echo of Kautilya ( I. 10). On Yāj I. 343 Viś. refers to the view of some that a march should be made when neighbouring chiefs are overwhelmed in calamities.713 This is the view of Kautilya almost in the same words. On Yāj. I. 341 Vis. speaks of the inanifold aspects of the work of a minister, some words of his comment being almost identical with Kautilya&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Some of the verses on pp. 25-27, for example, the first verse ( govadham &amp;c.) relers to Yaj. III. 234 ( where (govadha' is mentioned as the first among Upapātikas (51 in number ). On p. 26 he has a larika &lsquo;Smārtopi govadhostyarghyamarhayet prathamam gavi&rsquo;, which includes Mauusmrti III. 3 (last quarter ); on same page the words</p>

<p>Visvarūpa&rsquo;s work is thoroughly saturated with the lore of the Pūrvamimiṁsā. He quotes Jaimini by name (on Yāj. I. 225 where Jaimini VI. 8. 15 is quoted ). Curiously enough</p>

He quotes the sūtras of Jaimini as those of Yājñikas who know nynya (e. g. on Yāj. I. 53 be quotes Jaimini I. 3. 16 and on Yāj. I. 87 he quotes Jaimini VI. 8. 17). He applies the epithet Naiyāyikı, to a mīmāṁsaka like Sabara and speaks of the mimārsakas as nyāyavidaḥ.714 He mentions the Sūbarabhâsya by name (on Yīj. III. 243) and in in several places quotes the very words of Sabara (e. g. on Yāj. III. 181 ).716 He quotes the Slokavārtika of Kumārila (1. 12 the verse &lsquo;survasyaiva hi &amp;c) in his introductory remarks. in his comment on Yaj. 1. 7 he cites over fifty verses in the nature of kārikis dealing with the relation of śruti and smrti and kindred topics. These verses are his own composition, as in one of them he assures us that a certain poiut will be dealt with by him in detail in the section on sräddha.710 Iu interspersing his coin mentary with kārikūs of his own and in their style and pithiness he greatly resembles Kumārila.

II. 144 be speaks of wealth ( dravya ) being puruṣūrthre, where he alludes to the well-known distinction between krutvartha and puruṣūrthu, the subject of Jaimini&rsquo;s 4th chap.

<p>&lsquo;Though Višvarūpa was a past master in Pūrvamīmāṁsā lore, his philosophical views seem to have been identical with those of the great Sajikara. According to him moksu results from correct knowledge alone and the whole samsāra is due to avidyu il? He quotes anonymously one of Gaudlapāda&rsquo;s kārikāsiis (III. 5 ) on Yāj. III, 134.</p>
<p>He speaks on Yāj. III. 103 of Narada who knew the Veda of music ( gitivedavid ), of purāna ( on III. 175 ), and quotes verses (on Yñj. III. 85 ) from an abhidhūnukošu ( lexicon ) and from a Nämaratnamila (on III. 266). He speaks of the sloka of Bhiksātana (on III. 60.). He is in this probably referring to the Bhikrītanakivya,719 which is mentioned by the Sahityavarpani. Amony commentators he mentions Asahaya&rsquo;s bhâsya on Gautama by name ( on Yāj. III. 263 ). On Yāj. III. 256 he explains Mleccha as pulindas and</p>

<p>It has been shown above ( $34 pp. 423-425 ) how Visva rūpa&rsquo;s text of Yäj. varied in some respects from that of the Mit.; how he frequently refers to the views of commentators of Yāj. earlier than himself (in the words &lsquo;apare,&lsquo;&lsquo;anye&rsquo;), how he proposes several explanations of the same words in several cases.</p>
<p>Dr. Jolly (Journal of Iulian History, 1924, pp. 7-8) says that the citations of Vis in the Smộticandrikā about his having refuted the views of Dhireśvara cannot be traced in the printed Balakrida, as also the reference to Vis, in the Mit.</p>

<p>on Yaj. I. 81 and II. 135. It has been shown above ( note 529) that the printed Vis on Yaj. I. 80 does contain the view attributed to it by the Mit. As regards the Mit. un Yāj. II. 135 it has to be noted that the Mit. - does not mention Vis. by name there, but only speaks of bhagavān ācārya, &lsquo;720 which words are interpreted by the Subodhinī and the Būlambhatti as referring to Visvarūpa. It is true that the printed Viś. does not contain in so many words the explana tion attributed by the Mit. to &lsquo;bhagavān ācārya.&rsquo; But it is worth considering that in the printed Vis. the two quotations from Manu and Sankha do occur and are put in the mouth of an objector and are explained away in a way somewhat similar to that put forth in the Mit.721 As regards the passages of the Smrticandrikā, the matter requires careful examination. The Smrticandrika, (II. p. 294 Gharpure&rsquo;s ed.) says that according to the Samgrahakāra a widow was allowed to succeed to her souless husband&rsquo;s wealth if she submitted to niyoga, that the same was the view of Dhäreśvara and that Viśvarūpa refuted the view of Dhāreśvara. In no place does the printed Vis. name Dharesvara. The words of the Smrti candrika are uot to be taken literally. It will be shown below that the author, Devanmabhatta, flourished about 1200 A. D. while Dhāreśvara flourished between 1000-1050 A. D. Devanna had no correct idea of their relative chronological position. It has been shown above (p. 249 ) how though</p>

<p>Asahāya is named by the Mit., the Sarasvativilāsa very often says that Asahāya does not like ( or tolerate ) the views of Vijnanesvara. Similarly, the same work ( para 392 ) says that Dhāreśvara and Devasvāmiu do not tolerate the view of Vijñānesvara, but Dhireśvara is one of the predecessors of Vij. actually named by him. So all that the Smộticandrikā means is that Dhāreśvara and Visvarūpa differed in their views on the particular points mentioned by it. The word patni is taken by Viś. to mean a widow who is pregnant at the time of her husband&rsquo;s death and quotes the sutras of Vasistha and Gautama in support of his view as jñāpokas. So this view entirely differs from the view of Dhäreśvara that the widow of a sonless person succeeds if she submits to niyoga. The Smộticandrikā (II. p. 300 ) says that the Samgrahakāra placed the father&rsquo;s mother immediately after the mother and before the father, that the Samgrahakāra relied on the same arguments that were employed by Dhāreśvara and that Visvarūpa and others refuted those arguments. The passage in the printed Viś. is somewhat corrupt in this place. Vis. does place the mother before the father on the ground of the word nätā occurring first when the word &lsquo;pitarau&rsquo; or the compound mātăpitruritu&rsquo; is expanded. The comment does mention the verse of Man (9. 217 ) about the grandmother, but it makes no clear sense, as it stands.722 For the reason given above Rai Bahadur M. M. Chakravarti ( JASB for 1922, p. 345 and for 1915, p. 322 ) is not right when he places Vißvarūpa later than Bhojadeva because of the remarks of the Smặticandrikā.</p>
<p>In the works of Jimūtavāhana ( viz. the Dāyabhāga and the Y yavahāramñtrkā ), in the Smrticandrikā, the Hāralatā, and other later works like the Sarasvativilāsa, the views of Visvarīpa are frequently cited and discussed. Several such citations have been already examined by me (JBBRAS for 1926, pp. 200-204 ). From considerations of space I do not repeat here the discussion of those passages.

Hemādri724 refers to Visvarūpa&rsquo;s: explanation given in his section on partition which does not occur in the printed text. The result of the examination of these citations is that the printed text of Vis. is in the main genuine, but that in a few cases (parti cularly in the vyavahăra section ) it is corrupt or deficient.</p>
<p>Though Vis. holds the same view as the Mit. that owner ship does not for the first time arise on partition but that partition takes place of what is already (jointly ) owned, yet on numerous points the two disagree. A few of them may be set out here.</p>
<p>(1) Vis allows ( on Yāj. II. 118 ) the father unrest rictd freedom of distribution of property among his sons during his lifetime, while the Mit. expressly says that this power of unequal distribution is restricted to self acquired property.</p>
<p>( 2 ) Vis. ( on Yāj. II. 119 ) allows a share of property to the widows of predeceased sons and grandsons of a man when a partition takes place during his lifetime. The Mit. restricts the word &lsquo;patnyab&rsquo; to the father&rsquo;s own wives when he effects a partition during his lifetime.</p>
<p>(3) Viś. connects the words without detriment to the paternal estate&rsquo;( in Yāj.

<p>As Visvarūpa quotes Kumărila&rsquo;s Slokavārtika and is mentioned by the Mit. as an authoritative commentator it follows that he flourished between 750 A. D. and 1000 A. D. A greater approximation as to the date of Visvarūpa can be made, if the identity of Visvarūpa with Sureśvara be held established. Sureśvara, as he himself tells us in the Naiskarmyasiddhi, the Taittiriyopanişad bhāsya vārtika and other works, was à pupil of the great Sankarācārya whose generally accepted period is 788-820 A. D. Mādhavācārya in several works of his quotes as Visvarūpa&rsquo;s passages from the the well-known works of Sureśvara. For example, the Parāśara-Mādhaviya ( vol. I, part I, p. 57 ) quotes a karikā of Sureśvara as that of Visvarūpācārya.726 In the Vivarana prameyasaṁgraba ( Vizianagaram series p. 92 ) also Madhava quotes &amp; verse from the Bșhadāranyakopanisad bhāsya vārtika as Visvarūpa&rsquo;s.726 In the Purusārthaprabodha7a7 of Brahmānanda-bhārati (ms. in Bhau Daji collection, Bombay) composed in 1476 (probably of the Saka era ) the author speaks of the Naiskarmyasiddhi as a work of Višvarūpa. In the Saṁksepa-Sarkara-jaya, Visvarūpa is said to be the author of the two vārtikas on Sarkara’s bhāsya.738 According to tradition embodied in the various lives of Sarkara, the latter had four pupils, Sureśvara, Padmapāda, Totaka and Hastāmalaka. Several works mention Visvarūpa as one of the four pupils and omit the name Sureśvara. For example, in the Dvādaśa-vākya-vivarana of Gopāla (Aufrecht&rsquo;s Oxf. Cat. No. 557, p. 227 b) the four pupils of Sankara are named as Visvarūpa, Padmanābha, Totaka and Hastāmalaka. In the Mānasollāsa-vșttānta-vilāsa of Rāmatīrtba we are expressly</p>

<p>told that Sureśvara is another name of Visvarūpa, a pupil of Sankara (vide Mitra&rsquo;s Notices vol. V, No. 1763,p. 82). In the Saptasūtra-sanıyāsa paddhati (Mitra&rsquo;s Notices, vol. VI, p. 296 ) the four pupils are said to be Svarūpācārya, Padmā cārya, Totaka and Prthvidhara. The Guruvaṁsakāvya (Vanivilas ed. ) identifies Suresvara and Visvarāpa ( II.59) and makes him a pupil of Kumärila and Sankara. It may therefore be held as fairly established that Visvarūpa and Sureśvara are identical. Some corroboration is afforded by the fact that Viśvarūpa quotes Gauda pāda the &lsquo;paramaguru&rsquo; of Sankara and holds the same philosophical views as those of Sarkara. Just as Visvarūpa quotes Kumārila&rsquo;s Sloka vārtika, Suresvara also in his Taittiriyopanisadbhāsya-vārtika quotes a kārikā of Kumirila and styles the latter Mimāṁ sakam-manya.729 This shows that Suresvara treated Kumarila with scant respect, which seems unlikely if he was at any time Kumarila&rsquo;s pupil. Visvarūpa, in his introduction,730 performs an obeisance to the Sun, the great serpent (Sesa ), Tilakasvamin and Vinayaka. The Bhamati of Vācaspati&ndash;misra has a similar salutation. Vācaspati&ndash;misra wrote his Nyāyasūci-nibandha in 841-42 A. D. i. e. he was almost a contemporary of Sankara and his pupils. The learn ed editor of Viś. tells us that in a commentary on Viß. called Vacanamálā Sureśvara is bracketed with Maru and Yogisvara (Yajnavalkya ) as an expounder of Sastra (i. e. dharma sastra ).8l Therefore that commentator looked upon Vis. aud 729 मोक्षार्थी न प्रवर्तेत तत्र काम्यनिषिद्धयोः । नित्यनैमित्तिके कुर्यात्प्रत्यवाय.</p>

<p>Sureśvara as identical. From all these several considerations it follows that Visvarūpa flourished about 800-825 A. D. But this problem presents further difficulties. The mutual rela tions of Sureśvara, Bhavabhūti, Umbeka and Mandana are a great puzzle. I have dealt with this question in JBBRAS for 1928, pp. 289-293. The conclusions arrived at there are that Mandana&rsquo;s literary activity lies between 690-710, that of Umbeka between 700-730 and Sureśvara&rsquo;s between 810-840</p>
<p>A. D. and that Umbeka and Bhavabhuti are identical, but that Mandana and Sureśvara are separated by about 100 years,</p>
<p>In the H. of Dh. Vol. V pp. 1188-1198 the present author has discussed at some length the relative chronological posi tion of Kumārila, Prabhākara, Sälikanātha, Mandanamiśra, Umbeka, Bhavabhūti, Višvarūpa and Sureśvara and the conclusions relevant to Visvarūpa are that Mandanamisra is not identical with Viśvarūpa, that Visvarapa and Sureśvara are identical and that Sureśvara is the name of Visvarūpa after the latter became a sunnyäsin. The grounds in favour of the identity of Visvarüpa and Sureśvara are overwhelming as evidenced by the writings of great scholars like Mädhavācārya.</p>
<p>An interesting matter about Visvarūpa may be mentioned here. On Yāj. I. 162 / which is one of tbe verses that state the persons whose food should not be partaken of ), &lsquo;grămayājin&rsquo; is one ( who is abhojyūnnu ) and Viś. remarks that among the Mälavas a grāmayäjaki is known as Vaišva devika'. It is possible that Visvarūpa was an inhabitant of Mālava ( roughly present Malwa ) or that he had stayed there for some years.</p>
<p>Dr. Jolly has brought together in the Journal of Indian History ( vol. III. pp. 1-27 ) some valuable information about Visvarūpa.</p>
<p>In several later works a digest called Viśvarūpa-uibandha is frequently cited. That appears to be the composition of another Visvarüpa altogether. For example, the şan-ụavant sräddhanirnaya of Sivablatta (which is later than 160 A, D.) tells us that Višvarūpācirya composed a vivurder</p>

<p>remarkably with the words of the Mit. on Yāj. I. 53. The Varsakriyakaumudi (pp. 378, 380) mentions Visvarupa nibandha and quotes two verses cited therein. The Tithi nirnaya-sarvasamuccaya ( later than 1450 A. D.) quotes certain lcarileti.s of Visvarupa on the 18 varieties of Ekadasi.734 The Kalanirnayasiddhantavyakhya ( composed in 1653 A. D.) quotes certain verses of Viśvarūpa on the question of the disposal of food prepared for a marriage when a period of impurity on death supervenes.135 The Nirnayasindhu also quotes verses of Visvarūjia. From these data it follows that a Visvarūpa composed a commentary on Srāddhakaliká and also wrote a digest on matters of acara and other topics of dharma in prose and verse. Raghunandana in his Udvāha-. tattva (ed. by Jivananda, p. 116) names a Visvarupa samuccaya. It is likely that it is the same as Visvarapa nibundlhn.</p>

<p>proper one and not that of Bhāruci. The Parāśaramadhaviya736 and the Sarasvativilāsa ( para 133 ) inform us that Bharuci was of opinion that unmarried sisters were only entitled to a provision for their marriage and were not entitled to a fourth share.</p>
<p>The Smrticandrikā ( on Vyavahāra p. 268 ) holds that the Visuudharmasūtra (chap. 18 ) and Yāj. II. 124 ( bhagi nyusca&hellip;dattvamsam tu turīyakam ) not to be taken literally but all that is meant is that provision has to be made for the marriage expenses of the unmarried sisters of the sons taking the paternal wealth. The Par. M. (III. p. 510 ) notes that this was the view of Bhāruci (as against Medhātithi and Vijñānesvara and also of the Smrticandrikā ).</p>
<p>Vide Dr. T. R. Chintamani&rsquo;s paper on &lsquo;Bhāruci&rsquo; (in the Pro. of All India Or. Conf. ut Benares in 1943-44, vol. II, pp. 352-360, where he first collects 50 passages of Bhāruci found in the Sarasvativilăsa, then puts together passages where Medhatithi refers to the views of Upadhyāya and then refers to a fragment of Manusmrti commentary (on chapters VI to XII) where some colophons read Rjuvimalā and others Bhāruci.</p>
<p>Bhāruci, being mentioned by the Mit., is certainly older than 1050 A. D. Rāmānujăcărya, in his Vedārthasamgraba ( reprint from the Pandit, ed. of 1924, p. 154 ), mentions six ācāryas that preceded him as expounders of the Visistādvaita system, viz. Bodhāyana, Tanka, Dramida, Guhadeva, Ka pardin and Bhāruci. Similarly, the Yatindramatadipikā787 of Srinivāsadāsa (Anandāśrama ed.) enumerates (p. 2) a host of teachers as the predecessors of Rāmānujācārya in propound ing the Visistādvaita system. Vyāsa is the reputed author of the Vedāntasūtras, Bodhāyana is said to have composed a vrtti on the Vedānta-sūtras called Kștakoţi according to the</p>

<p>Prapanca-hrdaya ( p. 39, Trivandrum ed.). Tanka and Bra hmānandin are identical. Dramida is credited with the author ship of a bhāsya on the Vedānta-sūtras ( which is quoted by Rāmānuja in his bhāşya on II. 2. 3). Nāthamuni is said to have been the grand-father of Yāmunamuni, who was born about 916 A. D. Rāmānuja refers to him with great reverence as his teacher&rsquo;s teacher (parama-quru), vide Vedārtha samgraha, (p. 149 ) and is said to have been young when Yamuna died ( vide J. R. A S. for 1915, p. 147 and I. A. for 1909, p. 129). It is therefore obvious that the teachers are arranged by the Yatindramatadipikā in chronological order. Hence Bhāruci, being placed earlier than even Dramida and Nāthamuni, was comparatively an ancient author and could not have flourished later than the first half of the 9th century. Bhāruci, the jurist, also flourished before 1050. It is difficult to believe that there were two famous writers of the same name nearly about the same time. Hence it may provisionally be held that Bhāruci the writer on dharmaśāstra and Bhāruci the Višistādvaita philosopher are identical. If this identity be accepted, then Bhāruci the writer on dharmaśāstra becomes comparatively an early writer, being at least as old as Visva rũpa. His views agree on several points with those of Visva rūpa, which is a circumstance that lends some corroboration to the date proposed for him.</p>
<p>One interesting point about Bhāruci deserves mention here. From pumerous notices contained in the Sarasvativilāga it appears that Bhāruci either commented upon the Visņu dharmasūtra or wrote some work in which he took great pains to incorporate explanations of several sūtras of Visņu. For example, para 637 tells us that Bharuci explained the word' bija' occurring in a sutra of Vişņu as `pinda &lsquo;.738 In para 674 we are told that Bhāruci explained the word</p>
<p>niskārana&rsquo; in a sutra of Visnu and that he held that a daughter&rsquo;s son has not to perform the sraddha of his maternal grandfather if the latter has a son. Sudarsanācārya in his comment upon Apastam bagshya ( 8. 21. 2 ) ascribes the same</p>

<p>view to Bharuci and quotes the very words of Bhāruci.739 Vide J BBRAS for 1925 pp. 210-211 for further examples. There is nothing unnatural in Bharuci, the Visistādvaita philosopher, having composed a commentary on the Visnu dharmasútra. The extant Visnulharmasītra contains doctri nes peculiar to the Višistādvaita system such as the worship of Nārāyana or Vásudeva, the four Vyuhas of Vasudeva &amp;c. If Bhāruci was a Višistñilvaitin he would naturally turn to the sūtra of Visnu as having the greatest claim on his atten tion. Many of the sutras of Vislu quoted in the Sarasvati vilása with the explanations of Bharuci are not found in the printed text of Visnu, on which Nandapandita commented in the first half of the 17th century. It appears that the Sarasvativilāsa haid before it a larger version of Visnu current in the South ( vide note 118 p. 127 above ).</p>
<p>On several points there is divergence between the views of Bhāruci and those of the Mit. Bhäruci differed from the Mit. as to the definition of düyco and vibhāgu, he allowed niyoga to childless widows, while the Mit. condemned it in the case of all widows; Bharuci, like Visvarūpa, did not men tion supratibundlove and apratibuındar dayco; Bhāruci, like Visvarūpa, held that a coparcener who concealed some joint property was not guilty of theft, while the Mit. held that he was.

Vol 115 pp. 134–152 ( where on pp. 141-151 he arranges in three parallel columns parts of Bharuci&rsquo;s commentary and Melhätithi&rsquo;s Bhāsya on Manu VII. 50, 54, 147, 153, 154, with parallel passages from Kautilya&rsquo;s Arthaśāstra and on p. 144 of his paper compares only Bharuci aud Medhătithi on Manu VII. 52. Dr, Derrett holds (pp. 139-40 of his paper ) that Bharuci is nearer A. D. 700 than the period 800-850 which was assigned to Bhāruci in the H. of Dh. Vol. I. 1930 ) p. 265. Dr. Derrett holds (p. 138 of the paper ) that the passages which Medhătithi takes without acknowledgement froin Kautilya are not obtained from the Arthaśāstra direct, but from Bharucin, who is quoting from Kautilya with occasional udjustments, that Medhātithi did not know that he was reproducing the Arthaśāstra, that the Ms. used by Medhătithi was lefective, that in some places he could not read it.</p>
<p>What Manu VII. 13741 means is: there are several desirable matters ( istenu ), but the king might decide (or resolve ) to strictly enforce one of them. In that case that matter becomes a rule of Dharma. The same applies to cther matters that are undesirable (anistenu) but the king may resolve to put down with a strong hand one undesirable matter out of many. That would then become the rule of the realm and it has to be obeyed by all. Bhūruci&rsquo;s exegesis comes to this that the king is not the source of the rules of Dlarına, but it is Sāstra that defines the rules binding on the different varnas (classes) and</p>

<p>In the edition of Mandlik on Manu VIII. 150, Medhãtithi explains that that verse, according to some great ones was explained (iti mahattarair-vyākhyātam ) and immediately afterwards sets out the differing view of Yajvan and on Manu VIII. 151, Medhătithi mentions the explanation of Rju. Dr. Derrett (in footnote 20 on p. 141 of his paper in 2. D. M. G. ) puts forward the suggestion that Yajvan ought to be taken as standing for Rju and that Bhāruci is Rju. In the present state of our knowledge I cannot agree to this sugges tion. From Medhătithi&rsquo;s bhâsya on Manu II. 6743 ( which is a very long one, occupying more than seven printed pages ) it appears that there were many persons designated by Medhā tithi as &lsquo;Smộtivivarana karah&rsquo; as the quotation cited below will show. On Manu II. 25 he refers to the exegesis of Vivaranakāras that Dharma has five aspects (pañcaprakāro dharma iti Vivaranakarāh prapancayanti). It is clear from the parallel passages cited by Dr. Derrett on pp. 141-151 that there is remarkable agreement between the explanation of Bhāruci and of Medhātithi and that probably it is Medhătithi that borrows. But one&rsquo;s judgment may be suspended till the</p>

<li>Srikara The Mit. on Yāj. II. 135 alludes to the view of Srikara and others that the widow succeeded is heir to her deceased husband&rsquo;s estate if it was small.743 The Smytisära744 of Harinātha attributes the same view to Srikara and disappro ves of it. On Yāj. II. 169 the Mit.746 cites the view of Srikara about that topic and disapproves of it. Visvarūpa also gives two explanations of that verse of Yāj., the first of which agrees with that of the Mit, and the second is akin to Srikara&rsquo;s.</li>
</ol>
<p>The works of Jimütavāhana (viz. the Dayabhāga and the Vyavahāramātřkā ), the Smrticandrikā and the Sarasvati vilāsa contain very interesting notices of Srikara&rsquo;s views. Many of them were brought together by ne in JBBRAS for 1925, pp. 213-215. Srikara like Visvarūpa held the view that &lsquo;duhitarah in Yüj. refers to the putriku, he allowed the parents of a chililless person to succeed together at the same time. The Diyabhāga very severely criticizes the views of Srikara on the succession to re-united members, on vidyā dhana and on Yaj. II. 24 ( about enjoyment for 20 years ). 148 Most of the views attributed to Srikara were also entertained by Visvarūpa ur are more antiquated than Viśvarūpa&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>Srikara was probably a writer from Mithila and seems to have propounded the view of spiritual benefit as the criterion for judging superior rights of succession. The Smrtisära747 of Harinātha ascribes such a view to a Srikara-nibandha.</p>
<p>Whether Srikara wrote a commentary on a smrti or a general digest ( nibandha ) it is difficult to say. The Smrti candrikā748 says that Sambhu, Srikara and Devasvāmin com piled digests of smitis and allded their own explanations of them. The Smrtyarthasāra?!9 of Sridhara asserts in the in troductory verses that Srikantha and Srikaricārya filled up the gaps in the smrtis that were scattered about ( by intro ducing order out of chaos ). Srikara&rsquo;s explanations of Yajina valkya are frequently cited by the Mit., the Dāyabhāga and others. But the Mit. does not connect Srikara&rsquo;s name with Yājñavalkya as a commentator, though Visvarūpe is express ly so connected. It appears therefore inore likely that Srikara</p>

<p>573</p>
<p>wrote a digest of smètis in which he paid particular attention to the explanation of the words of Yājsavalkya. The Rāja nitiratnākara750 of Candesvara quotes the views of Srikara on Rājaniti, one of which is that the poor and helpless are entitled to a share of the royal wealth.</p>
<p>Hemålrist quotes the view of Srikara on Visnu and dis approves of the faults found therein by the author of the Paụuita-paritosa.</p>
<p>As Srikara is quoted by the Mit., he is certainly earlier than 1050 A. I). As his views agree largely with Visvarūpa&rsquo;s he may provisionally be regarded as nearly of the same period as Visvarūpia&rsquo;s. He cannot be earlier than Asahiya who is named both by Viśvarūpa and Medhatithi, though both of them are silent about Srikara. Hence Srikara must be placed somewhere between 800 and 1050 A. D. and probably flourish ed in the 9th century.</p>
<p>This Srikara must be distinguished from another Srikara, the father of Srinātha.</p>

<li>Medhatithi Medhatithi is the author of an extensive and erudite commentary ( bhusyu ) on the Manusmrti. It is the oldest extant commentary on that smrti. The bhâsya of Medhătithi was first published about forty years ago by Rao Saheb V. N. Mandlik in Bombay and recently Mr. J. R. Gharpure of Bombay brought out an edition of Medhātithi which closely follows Mandlik&rsquo;s edition. A critical edition of the bhāsya based upon all the available Msg. is a great clesideratum. A new edition in two volumes based on several mss. edited by M. M. Dr. Ganganath Jha was published in the G. O. I. Series in 1932 and 1939. In this edition also ten verses in the 3rd adhyāya are wanting and in adhyāya nine there</li>

<p>are substantial lacunas in the commentary on verses 1, 4-6 as in Mandlik&rsquo;s edition. An English translation of the bhāsya by M, M. Dr. Ganganath Jha is in progress and several parts have been published so far. In the following, Mr. Gharpure&rsquo;s edition has been used. The bhāsyu as printed is corrupt in many places, particularly in the 8th, 9th and 12th adhyāyus. In Mr. Gharpure&rsquo;s edition there is no bhlisya on verses 182-202 of the 9th chapter.</p>
<p>Bühler in his learned and exhaustive Introductiou to the Manusmrti (S. B. E. vol. 25 ) brings together a good deal of information about Medhātithi ( pp. CXVIII-CXXVI ). In JBBRA S for 1925, pp. 217-221, I have offered criticisms on some of Bühler&rsquo;s views and have given some additional information.</p>
<p>In several M88. of the bhūsyu at the end of several adhyāyas occurs a verse782 which says that a king nained Madana, son of Sahārana, brought copies of Medhātithi&rsquo;s commentary from another country and effected a restoration (jūrnoddhūru ). This does not refer to the restoration of the text of Medbătithi, but to the completion of the library of the king, who was Madanapāla, son of Sädhārana and flourished, as we shall see later on, in the latter half of the 14th century.</p>
<p>Dr. Jolly (Tagore Law Lectures p. 6 ) holds Medhătithi to be a southerner on account of the fact that his father&rsquo;s name was Virasvainin and on account of the attention paid to his blāsya by southern writers. It cannot be said that names ending in &lsquo;svāmin&rsquo; were a monopoly of the south. The Rājatara rigiņi gives literary celebrities whose names ended in &lsquo;svārniu&rsquo; (e. g. V. 34 mentions a Sivasvāmi). Kšīrasvāmin was a Kashmirian. The south has always been famed for preserving Mss. of valuable works from the north. M88. of the Kāvyālamkāra of Bhimaha, a Käshmiriau, are very rare and have been found only in the south. Bühler (p. CXX III)</p>

<p>seems to be right in holding that Medhātithi was a Kashmi rinn (or at least an inhabitant of Northern India ). In explain ing such words as &lsquo;svarā tre’and janapadah&rsquo;( Manu VII. 32 and VIII. 42 ) Medhătithi introduces Kashmir. He gives ( on Manu VIII. 400 ) the monopoly of the sale of elephants as a privilege of the kings of Kashmir where saffron abounds.763 He says that the rainbow is called vijnana-chāyā&rsquo; in Kashmir ( on Manu IV. 59). He very frequently refers to northerners i. e. on Manu III. 234 he says &lsquo;kutapa&rsquo; is the word for what is well-known as &lsquo;kambala&rsquo; among northern people and on III. 238 he says &lsquo;northern people&rsquo;wrap their heads with sūtaukaus (garments ). He says on Manu II. 24 that in the Himalayas in Kashmir it is not possible to perform the daily sundhyū in the open por is it possible to bathe every day in &amp; river in Hemanta &lsquo;and Sisira&rsquo;. On Manu II. 18 he says in other countries, some say, people marry one&rsquo;s maternal uncle&rsquo;s daughter ; but that is opposed to the words of Gautama&rsquo; (4.3) and proceeds &lsquo;even in that country taking food in the same plate with (or in the company of ) one whose thread ceremony is not performed is not at all re garded as dharma (but as improper conduct). This is clearly a reference to Baudhāyana Dh. S. (1. 1. 19 ) according to which &lsquo;mātulasuti-parinayana&rsquo; and taking food in the same plate with one whose upanayana is not performed are two of the five usages peculiar to the south. It is fair to add that later writers like Kamalakarabhatta (Nirnayasindhu, 3rd pariccheda on sāpindya ) regard Medhātithi as a southerner.</p>
<p>Medhātithi quotes from or names numerous smrti writers, such as Gautama, Baudhāyana, Avasta mba, Vasistha Visuu, Sankba, Manu, Yáj., Nāruda, Parāśara, Brhaspati, Kātyāyana And others. He refers to Bșhaspati as a writer ou&rsquo;vārtā&rsquo; (Manu VII. 43 and IX, 326 ) and to Brhaspati and Ufonas às writers on politics and government ( Manu VIII. 283, VII. 2 and 155 ). On Manu VII. 43 he refers to Canakya as a writer on dandaniti'. In numerous places he seems to have</p>

<p>drawn upon Kautilya’s work. For example, on Manu VII. 155 in interpreting pancavarga' as &lsquo;kupaţika, udāsthita, gặha patika, vaidehika and tāpasavyañjana&rsquo; he explains them almost in the words of Kautilya (1. 2 ). On VII, 148 he quotes the five angas of mantra in the very words of Kautilya.784 Vide also his remarks on Manu VII. 54 ( testing of ministers by upalhās ). He names Asahāya ( on 8. 156 ) and certain writers as Smộtivivaranakārāḥ ( on II. 25 ). Bühler is not quite accurate (p. cxx, n. 1) when he states that Medhātithi gives only once the name of an early commentator'. On VIII. 3 he refers to the interpretations of Bhartryajña He refers to the interpretations of Yajvan (on VIII. 151 and 156 ). Yajvan is only the last part of a name (as in Devarāja yajvan). He quotes the interpretation of Manu by Upadhyāya (on II. 109, IV. 162, V. 43, IX. 141 and 147 ). Bühler holds that Medhātithi refers to his own teacher. It is more likely that Upadhyāya, like Yajvan, is the name or part of the name of a previous commentator of Manu. On VIII. 152 the explanations of Rju are twice cited. On IX. 253 Medhătithi cites the view of one Visnusvāmin.765 From the tenor of the quotation it appears that Visnusvāmin was a writer on Mimāinga and not a commentator of Manu us Bühler thought (p. cxx, n. 1). Some M88. read the word preceding Visnusvāmi as &lsquo;kovara&rsquo;, others as &lsquo;kõvara! It is probably &lsquo;kāvera&rsquo; (residing on the Kāveri river ).</p>
<p>He quotes ( on Manu I. 19 ) a verse from the Sarikhyaka rikā (prakrter malūn &amp;c ). On Manu I. 5 Medhătithi remarks that the evolution set out (in Manu I. 5 ff&rsquo;) is in some parts based on the Purānas and in some other parts based on the Sankhya system and that it does not matter much as regards dharma' and &lsquo;adharma&rsquo; whetber it (i. e. evolution ) is well understood or not. He further states that *Mahān' occurring in Manu I. 15 is the Sãjkhya Mahat tattva' and that in Manu I. 16 &lsquo;ahankāra&rsquo; and the five &lsquo;tanmātrās ’ of the Sān khya system are mentioned.

<li>17 he quotes a part of Sankhyakurikā 22 (pancabhyah pañca bhūtāni ) and on I. 19 quotes the first half of the same kārikā. He further remarks that the Pauranic procedure of evolution is mentioned by Manu in I. 21.11. He speaks of Vindhyavāsa756 as a Sănkhya and says that he does not admit a subtle interim body ( antarabhavadeha ). This is probably taken froun Kumārila&rsquo;s words.167 He repeatedly refers to the purāņus, tells us (on 11I. 232) that they were composed by Vyāsa and contained accounts of creation. He quotes (on XII. 118) a verse from the Vākyapradipa.168</li>

<p>He tells us ( on II. 6 ) that the Pancarītras, Nirgranthus (Jains ) and Pasupatas were outside the pale of Vedic orthodoxy.169</p>
<p>Medhătithi had drunk deep at the fountain of the Parva mimāṁsā. His bhāsya is full of the terms virthi and artha vāda. On Manu III. 45 (rtu-kālābhigāmi syāt ) Medhatithi discusses whether this is a niyamu or parisunkhyā just as the Mit. on Yāj. 1. 79 and 81 discusses the same question and Medhātitbi quotes the well-known verse vidhir-atyantama prāptau niyamah pāksike sati'&amp;c. Medhătithi (at the end of his commentary on Manu I. 11 ) remarks that these are arthavādus and are to be explained some-how in a metaphorical sense, and not literally (Arthavādā&hellip; yathā kathāñcidgunavādena niyante ). For Arthavīda and its three varieties, vide H. of Dh. Vol. V. part 2 pp. 1240-1. On Mapu II. 1 he remarks in the first adhyāya five or six verses are meant to set out the purpose of this sästra, the rest are artha vādas and it does not matter much if they are not well understood ; instruction is directly given here (in II. 1 and the following verses on What Dharma is &lsquo;. Even in Chap. II he remarks that II, 83, 87, 233 are mere arthavādas, Vide, for example, remarks on Manu III. 17, 19, 37, 50, 56, V. 53-54, VIII. 21, 22, 98 &amp;c. He quotes Jaimini&rsquo;s Sūtras frequently and applies them to the interpretation of smrti texts at every step.

<p>Medhātithi mentions several nyāyas for explaining the Manusmrti. On II. 29 he extends the Mimāṁsānyāya (sarva sākhãpratyayam-ekam karma&rsquo; P. M. S. II. 4. 8-33 which applies to Vedic passages ) to Smộtis also and states that where the smrtis differ, there is either an option or all pro visions of the Smộtis on a certain point are to be added up; vide H. of Dh. Vol. V. p. 1350 for this nyāya. On Manu II.101 he mentions the nyāya &lsquo;Gunalope ca mukhyasya&rsquo; for an explanation of which, vide H. of Dh. Vol. V. p. 1343 (where it is shown that it is based on P. M. S. X. 2. 63 ). On Manu II. 102 he quotes the verse &lsquo;arke cet madhu vindeta kimartham parvatam vrajet&rsquo;( quoted by Sabara on I. 2. 4 ). Vide H. Dh. Vol. V. p. 1340 for references. On Manu X. 127 Medbåtithi relies on &lsquo;Yävad-vacanam vācanikam&rsquo;, for which vide H. Dh. V. p. 1348. Another nyāya that M. mentions is nimittāvş. ttau naimittikāvșttiḥ' on Manu X1. 220, which is explained in H. of Dh. Vol. V. p. 1345.</p>
<p>Some common nyāyas mentioned by M. are · Brāhmaṇa parivrāja kanyāya (on Manu I. 22 ), Kākatăliya-nyāya (on Manu I. 12 ), Visvajit-nyāya ( on Manu II. 2).</p>
<p>Bühler at first took the remark on Manu XII. 19 ) about Sārīraka' as780 referring to Sankara’s bhāsya on the Vedānta sutra, but later on changed his opinion (SBE vol. 25, p. CXXII) and held that it probably implies a reference to the Sārīraka sūtras. Bühler&rsquo;s considered opinion does not seem to be right. The words &lsquo;yatheha rājā &hellip; apaiti&rsquo; are a summary of Sankara’s bhāsya on Vedāntasūtra II. 1. 34 and II. 3. 42. and I. 2. 11-12. On Manu II. 83 he refers to the Upanisad bhāsya761 on Chāndogya II. 23. 4 and says that that passage</p>

<p>has been differently explained in the bhāsya. Sankara does explain that passage of the Chándogya differently. But this is not all. In various other places Medhātithi seems to have in view the Sărirakabhāsya of Sarkara. For example, he makes an obeisance to Parabrahma like an advaitin vedānta vedya-tattvaya&hellip;parasmui Brahmane namah&rsquo;. On I. 80 he ha8782 before himn Sankara&rsquo;s bhāsya on the sūtra &lsquo;lokavat tu Tilakaivalyam&rsquo; ( Vedantasutra II. 1. 33 ). He, however, seems to have favoured the position that the attainment of noksa is due763 not to mere correct knowledge but to the combina tion ( samuccurya) of knowledge and learma ( vide remarks on Manu VI. 32, 74-75 and XII. 87-90 ). This was probably due, as Kullika remarks784 ( on I. 3), to his being a profound studeut of Mimamsā.</p>
<p>Froin Medhātithi’s bhāsya it is perfectly clear that the text of Manu on which he commented was practically the same that we have now. He refers to ancient (cirantana) expositors of Manu (on V. 127 ) and to former ( pūrva ) ex positors (IV. 176, II. 134, X. 21 ). He discusses various read ings in several places ( vide III. 119, IV, 99, 185, 229,</p>

<p>VIII. 53 ). On VIII, 182-183 he notes?05 that the order of the verses was traditionally different. Kullūka also notices that those two verses and the next two were read in one order by Medlātithi and Bhojadeva and in another by Govindarāja. On 9. 93 he notes that according to some that verse is not Manu&rsquo;s. 760 On Manu II, 160 he gives three interpretations of the word &lsquo;Vedāntopagatam&rsquo;. In numerous places he refers (in the words &lsquo;auye&rsquo;, &lsquo;kecit&rsquo;&rsquo; pirval&rsquo;) to the explanations of the Manusmrti that ditfer from his own; vide for example, on I. 28, 84, II. 5 ( bahavascātra vyākhyāvikalpāh, asăratvat tu na pradarsitāḥ ), II. 28, 8+; III. 109; VIII. 1, 2, 20, 30, 43, 359, 375, 410; IX. 18, 64, 76; X. 21, 188. He quotes nuinerous verses with the words &lsquo;uktam ca&rsquo; or &lsquo;tuduktam&rsquo; without naming the sources, some of which are taken from the Upavisads ( as&rsquo;na ha vai sasarīrasya satah&rsquo;on II. I which is Cháu. Up. VIII. 12. 1 or dve brahmani veditavye&rsquo;on VI. 84, which occurs in Maitrāyani Up. VI. 22 ) or on II. 83 he quotes Chin. Up. II. 23. 3 &lsquo;tad-yathā sarkunā sarvāni patrani santrıļāni evain-onkārena sarvã vāk santrimnă&rsquo; and on the same verse he quotes Yogasūtra I. 27-28. He quotes many verses from the Mahābhürata, inentions the Nirukta (on I. 22, II. 10, V.5), quotes Piniui&rsquo;s Sūtras on many verses and tbe Mahābhâsyakura (on Manu II. 12 and 123 ). On several verses his bhāsya extends to three, four or even five printed pages as on II. 105, 189, III. I(five pages ), 238, V. 2, VIII. 104, 148, X. 5.</p>
<p>One remarkable fact about Medhātithi may be mentionell here. Vijñānesvara flourished about two hundred years after Medhatithi and names 80 Smrtis and Smộtikūras. Yajna valkya (1. 4-5) names twenty authors that propounded Dharma. Visvarüpa ( commentator of Yāj. ), who flourished a little earlier than ( or might he at the most a contemporary of Medhătithi ) names 30 Dharmaśästra authors. But Medha tithi, who wrote an extensive bhāsyu on Manu, speaks in general of Kalpasūtrakäras (on III. 5), of Grhyasmrtis (on II. 29 ) and Grlıyakaras (on III. 45 ), names (besides</p>

( a few times ), Usanas (two verses on VII. 154 ), Kityāyana (only ouce on VII. 1), Gautama ( a. of Dharmasūtra, most frequently quoted ), Nirada ( quoted several times ) Baudhāyana (two verses on Manu IV. 36 ), Brhaspati ( as writer on Vārtā on Manu VII. 43 and IX. 326 ), Yājña valkya ( quoted more than a dozen times ), Vasistha ( quoted frequently ), Visņu ( a. of Dh. S. only once on Manu III. 238 ), Vyasa ( on Manu I. 55, X. 127 ), Sankha ( 3 times in prose on Manu III, 234, V. 62 and 111) and once on V. 60 a verse yadyekajātā bahavah&rsquo; &amp;c. which is ascribed to Sajikha-Likhita in Srāddhakalpataru p. 263 ), Saṁvarta ( two verses on Manu XI. 114-5), Hārīta (three times in prose on Manu V. 60, 111 and 119). Medhātithi does not quote any (Smrtikára with the prefix.brhat&rsquo; or &lsquo;yrddha,&rsquo; while the Mit, mentions over a dozen smộtikāras with those prefixes ( vide below on Mit.). This leads one to presume that most of the works with those prefixes were either not composed before Medhātithi or ( more probably ) were recent works in Medhatithi&rsquo;s day or that, even th some of them were composed sometime before Medhătithi, they had not penetrated to distant Kashmir in Medhă tithi&rsquo;s day.</p>
<p>Medhātithi&rsquo;s bhūsya is full of very interesting information. But for want of space it cannot be analysed in detail. The Mit. (on Yāj. II. 124 ) refers to the view of Asahāya and Medhatithi ( on Manu 9. 118 ) about the fourth share to be given to an unmarried sister at a partition between brothers and follows it in preference to Bharuci&rsquo;s. On Yūj. III. 24 the Mit. tells us that certain texts of Rsyaśrriga about varying periods of impurity for brāhmaṇas and others were not accepted as authoritative by Dhāreśvara, Visvarūpa and Medhñtithi. According to himnī07 sainyāsu does not mean the giving up of all the obligatory duties laid down by śāstra. but the giving up of thankeira. He&rsquo;s allowed a brähmana to</p>

<p>adopt even a ksatriya boy. He explains away the well-known verse &lsquo;naste mrte&hellip;patiranyo vidhiyate&rsquo; by taking the word &lsquo;pati&rsquo; in its etymological sense and says769 that the verse suggests that in order to maintain herself in such calamities the woman may take service with another person as her protector.</p>
<p>Medhātithi quotes several verses from his own work called Smrtiviveka on Manu II. 6 ( in all 24 verses ) and on X. 5 he says that he has dealt with the topic of mixed castes in Smrtiviveka. That work, therefore, was either entirely in verse or contained numerous verses. The Parāśara-Madhaviya ( vol. I, part 2, pp. 183-186 ) has a long quotation in verse on the duties of yatis from &amp; work called Smrtiviveka and the game work several times quotes verses attributed to Medbătithi ( vol. I, part I, p. 276 and part 2, p. 172). Hence the Smrti viveka cited by the Parāśara-Mădhavīya most probably is Medhātithi&rsquo;s work. Lollata, o an early writer quotes several verses of Medhātithi in his work on srāddha'. In the Tithi niruaya-sarvasamuccaya ( Bhadkamkar collection ) several verses of Medhătithi on obstacles to marriage such as death are quoted.771 In the Yatidharmasangraha of Visvesvara&ndash; sarasvati ( Anandāśrama ed. p. 27 ) two well-known verses about &lsquo;costāngamaithuna&rsquo; ( viz. smaraņam kārtanai keliḥ</p>

<p>etc.) are ascribed to Medhătithi and another verse72 is cited (on the same page ) about the six duties of yatis. These quotations show that Medhātithi wrote an extensive work in verse on several topics of dharma. It is to be fervently hoped that this work of Medhătithi would be brought to light some day or other. Coming as it does from such an erudite and ancient writer, it would throw a flood of light on the development of dharmaśāstra.</p>
<p>As Medhātithi names Asahāya and Kumārila and most probably quotes the views of Sankarācārya, he is later than 820 A. D. As the Mit looked upon him as an authoritative writer, he must be earlier than 1050 A. D. Most probably be flourished between 825 and 900 A. D. Kullūka&quot;73 on Manu III. 127 says that Medhătithi is much earlier than Govindarāja ( 1050-1100 A. D. ). Lollata is mentioned as a predecessor in the Smrtyartha-sära of Sridhara, which was composed between 1150&ndash;1200 A. D. So Lollata is much earlier than 1150 A. D. He looked upon Medhatithi as a writer whose work was as authoritative as a smrti. A work called Prakāśa774 which is quoted in the Kalpataru appears to have mentioned Medha tithi. Hemādri quotes at great length Medhătithi&rsquo;s comments in several places. 776 Hence the above date is amply corrobo rated. This conclusion is further strengthened by the fact that, though he names Asahāya, he does not mention Vißve rüpa, Bhāruci or Srīkara. If by Migra,778 in his comment on Manu XII. 118 he refers to Vācaspati-migra, the author of the Bhāmati aud other works, then he will have to be placed after 850 A. D.</p>
