1. Meaning of Dharma 

_Dharma_ is one of those Sanskrit words that defy all attempts at an exact rendering in English or any other tongue. That word has passed through several vicissitudes. The dictionaries set out various meanings of Dharma such as “ordinance, usage, duty, right, justice, morality, virtue, religion, good works, function or characteristic." Dharma is also personified as a deity, as in the well-known verse. 'Aditya-candrāv anilo’nalaśca... dharmaśca jānāti narasya vṛttam'(Mahābhārata, Adi., chap. 74.16) or as in Manusmrti VIII. 16. vr̥ṣo hi bhagavān Dharmaḥ' ( which also occurs in Sāntiparva 90.75 ). Vide H. of Dh. Vol. V (part 1) pp. 19-21 for the three words "vrata', 'dharman' and 'rta' and JBBRAS. Vol. 29 (1954) pp. 1-28. In the hymns of the Rgveda the word appears to be used either as an adjective or a noun (in the form dlarman, generally neuter) and occurs at least about sixty times by itself (i. e, not preceded by a particle like vi or some words like satya), and about eighteen times in combination with a particle 'vi' and with the words *sva' and 'satya' fifty-six times therein. It is very difficult to say what the exact meaning of the word dharma was in the most ancient period of the Vodic language. The word is clearly derived from root dh? (to uphold, to support, to nourish ). In a few passages, the word appears to be used in the sense of up holder or supporter or sustainer' as in Rg. I. 187.11 and X. 92.22. In these two passages and in Rg. X. 21.33 the word dharma is clearly masculine. In all other cases, the word is either obviously in the neuter or presents a form which may be either masculine or neuter, In most cases the meaning of dharman is religious ordinances or rites 'as in Rg. I. 22. 18, V. 26. 6, VIII. 43. 24, IX. 64. 1 &c. The refrain'tani dharmāni prathamānyāsan' occurs in Rg. I. 164. 43 and 50, X. 90. 16. Similarly, we have the words 

prathamā dharmā' (the primeval or first ordinances) in Rg. III. 17. 1, and X. 56. 3 and the words 'sanatā dharmāni (ancient

ordinances ) occur in Rg. III. 3. 1. In some passages this sense of * religious rites' would not suit the context, e. g. in IV. 53. 34, V. 63.75, VI. 70. 16, VII. 89. 57. In these passages the meaning seems to be 'fixed principles or rules of conduct'. In the Vāja saneyasamhita the above senses of the word dharman are found, and in II. 3 and V. 27 we have the words 'dhruvena dharmaņā.' In the same Samhita the form 'dharmaḥ' (from dharma) becomes frequent, e. g. X. 29, XX. 9. The word 'Vidharman'is froquently employed in the Rgveda viz. in the instrumental (in X. 46. 6), in the dative (in VIII. 7.5), in the locative in eight passages (I. 164. 36, III. 2. 3, VI. 71. 1, IX. 4. 9, IX. 64. 9, and IX. 86. 29-30, IX. 100.7) probably meaning Vidhāraņe) and in the vocative (in V. 17.2). It is difficult to assign a definite meaning to this word in all these passages. But from several passages where the word 'vidhartr' is employed (which is derived from the same root dhệ with ri) it follows that vidharman probably means the same thing as vidhart; (in Rg. II. 28. 4, VII.7.5, VII. 41. 2, VII. 56. 24) applied to different gods. "Svadharman'as an epithet of Agni occurs in Rg. III. 21.2 and the word Satyadharman is applied to different gods alone viz. to Savity, Viśvedevāh, Agni and to Mitra and Varuna in I. 12 7, V. 51.2, V. 63. 1, X. 34. 8, X. 121. 9, X. 139. 3. In the case of this word the meaning appears to be whose regulations do not fail'. The Atharvaveda contains many of those verses of the Rgveda in which the word dharman occurs, e. g. VI. 51.3 (acittyā сot tava dharmā yuyopima), VII, 5. 1 (Yajñena yajñamayajanta), VII. 27.5 (trini pada vicakrame ). In XI. 7. 17 the word 'dharmaḥ' seems to be used in the sense of 'merit acquired by the porformance of religious rites.' In the Aitareya-brāhmana, the word dharma seems to be used in an abstract sense”, viz. 'the whole body of religious duties'. The

1. Meaning of Dharma 

Bșhadaranyaka Up. (I. 14. 14) treats Dharma and Satya as equivalent. In the Chandogya-upanişadlo (2.23) there is an important passage boaring on the meaning of the word dharmut. 'there are three branches of dluerna, ono is (constituted by sacrifice, study and charity (i. o. tho stago of house-holder ), the second ( is constitutod by ) austeritios (i. 0. the stage of being a hermit); the third is the brahmacūrin dwelling in the house of his teacher and making himself stay with the family of his teacher till the last; all these attain to the worlds of meritorious men; one who abides firmly in bruhman attains immortality.' It will be seen that in this passage the word * dharmu' stands for the peculiar duties of the Wśramas. As the word brahmacūri itself occurs in this passage of the Chandogya, it is clearly indicated that this brief passage means to rofer only to the aśramas and their special duties. Prof. Hazra (in *Our Heritage' Vol. VII part I pp. 15-36, 'on the early meaning and scope of the word dharma') remarks (on p. 20 ) that the word Dharma as used in Vedic literature did not mean any act of vyavahāra is shown definitely by this Chandogya passage (II. 23. 1). This is a strange (to put it mildly ) argument as one passage from an Upanisad (relating to only one small aspect of dharma ) cannot control the meaning of the word 

Dharma' occurring hundrods of times in Samhitās, Brāhmanas and other Upanisads. Vide Br. Up. I. 4. 14, II, 5, 11 for the wide conception of Dharma (to cite only a fow Upanisad passages). The foregoing brief discussion establishes how the 

ord dharma passed through several transitions of meaning nd how ultimately its most prominent significance came to be 'the privileges, duties and obligations of a man, his standard of conduct as a member of the Aryan community, as a member of one of the castes, as a person in a particular stage of life.' It is in this sense that the word seems to be used in the well known exhortation to the pupil contained in the Taittiriya“ 

( Continued from lust puge ) Hicra Hara ( 97. V. 4. 124 ). Pāṇini employs the word dharma in some of his sūtras as in an atia (II. 4.4, wbich derives the word धार्मिक ), IV.4.92 (derives धर्म्य from धर्म), चरणेभ्यो धर्मवत् IV. 2. 46 ( derives words like $15 ti, 59172177), '1tY ERIA' (IV. 4. 47),

upanişad (I. 11 ) 'speak the truth, practise (your own) dharma &c.' It is in the same sense that the Bhagavadgitā uses the word dharma in the oft-quoted verse "svadharme nidhanam śreyah' The word is employed in this sense in the dharma Šāstra literature. The Manusmrti (1.2) tells us that the sages requested Manu to impart instruction in the dluarmas of all the varņas. The Yājñavalkya-smrti (I. 1) employs it in the same sense. In the Tantra-vārtikall also wo are told that all the dharmasūtras are concerned with imparting instruction in the dharmas of varṇas and ūsramas. Medhātithi commenting on Manu says that the expounders of smrtis dilate upon dharma as five-fold, e. g. varnadhirma, ūśrama-ılharma, wrnūsrama-dharma, naimittikadharma ( such as prāyaścitta) and gunadharma (the duty of a crowned king, whether Ksatriya or not, to protect).12 It may be noted that the Mitaksara on Yaj. I. 1 after mentioning the fivefold dharmas and illustrating them adds a sixth category viz. "Sidhārana-dharma'- duties common to all men (including even candālas) such as ahimsā and quotes a vedic passage in support 'na himsyāt sarvā bhūtāni'. Slightly differing enume rations of virtues to be cultivated by all men are found in Gaut. Dh. S. VIII. 23-25, Matsyapurāna 52. 8-10 (8 in all), Manu X. 63 (five), Yāj. I. 1. 22 (nine). Vide H. D. Vol. II pp. 10-11 and vol. V pp. 1023–24, 1637 and 1648. It may be noted that the Arthaśāstra of Kautilya (1. 3. 13) proscribes for all men ahimsā, satya, śauca, anasūyā, ānțsamsya and kşamā. It is in this sense that the word dharma will be taken in this work. Numerous topics are comprehended under the title dharmaśāstra, but in this work prominence will be given to works on ācāra and vyavahūra (law and administration of justice ). 

11 'parimetio quifquam eratara ' p. 237. 12 Go on il. 47. . 19.1 and Tile-775 on 2.25 give the same five. 

fold classification. The Bhavisyapurana (in Brühma.parva 181, 10-15) sets out this fivefold dharma (Veok, Press ed.). The Gaut. Dh. 19. 1 Bays 'Ukto varnadharmaścāsramadharośca' and then proceeds to dilate upon prāyaścittas (i. e, naimittika dharma). The Ap. Db. S. begins, *atbātah Samayācārikan dharniān vyakhyāsyāmaḥ' (We shall expound the dharmas relating to the practices based on convention and adds immediately that the conventions settled by those who are conversant with dharma and the authorities and not any and every corption whatever,' The Āp. Gr. S. begins 'Atba karmānyadarsdani gshyante.' That is actions are Srutilaksana and acāralakşam. Amma has several meanings as Amara says 'Samayðh sapatha matura siddhanta-samvidaḥ."

1. Meaning of Dharma 

It would be interesting to recall a few other definitions of dharma. Jaimini13 defines dharma as a desirable goal or result that is indicated by injunctive (Vodic) passages.' The word dharma would mean such rites as aro conducive to happiness and are onjoined by Vedic passages. The Vaisosikasütral4 defines dharma as 'that from which results happiness and final beatitude.' The Manusinști (in 11. 1) gives the following general definition of Dharma.14a 'Know Dharma to be that which is practised by the learned that lead a moral life, that are free from hatred and partiality, and that is accepted by their hearts (i. e. conscience ).' Another similar definition is given by the Nitisara of Kāmandaka VI. 7 'that is Dharma which when done is praised by āryas (respectable people) that are conversant with (the vedic) tradi tion and adharma is said to be that which such people consure'. This is a versified rendering of Ap. Dh. S. I. 7. 20 yat-tu āryāḥ kriyamānam prašamsanti sa dharmo yadgarhante sosdharmaḥ.' There are several other more or less one-sided definitions of dharma such as 'ahimsā paramo dharmaḥ'(Anušā sanaparva 115. 1.), 'ānrśamsyam paro dharmaḥ' (Vanaparva 373. 76), "ācārah paramo dharmah' (Manu I. 108). Hārīta defined dharma as srutipramānakals' (based on revelation). In the Buddhist sacred books the word dharina has several senses. It often means the whole teaching of Buddha ( S. B. E. Vol. X. p. XXXIII). Another meaning of dharma peculiar to the Buddhist system is an element of existence, i. e. of matter, mind and forces16.

The present work will deal with the sources of dharma, their contents, their chronology and other kindred matters. As the material is vast and the number of works is extremely large, only a few selected works and some important authors will be taken up for detailod treatment. More space will he dovotod to comparatively early works.
