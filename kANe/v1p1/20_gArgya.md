20. Gārgya Višvarūpa (on Yaj. I. 4-5) quotes a verse of Věddha Yájñavalkya in which Gärgya is enumerated among the expo unders of Dharma ( dharmavaktūraḥ). He quotes two sūtras, one from Gárgya ( on Yāj. I. 72260 ) and the other from Vțddha Gārgya361 (on Yâj. I. 195). Therefore it seems that a sutra work of Gárgya on dharma did exist. The Mit. (e. g. on Yāj. III. 326 ), Aparārka and the Sinșticandrika quote several verses of Gārgya on õhnika, śräddha and práyascitta. Parā sara (I. 13) mentious Gárgya among writers on dharma. Apa rārka contains (pp. 124, 190, 368, 544 ) verses from Gárgya on topics of dharina. It seeins that the two writers are identical. Aparārka also quotes several verses from Gārgya of astrono mical import (e. g. p. 5:17 on the nomenclature of the months as Caitiu in connection with the signs of the zodiac). This was probably an independent work. Fragments of a Gärgi samhiti on astronomy and astrology have been recovered and it contains valuable historical information ( vide Kern's pre face. to Brhat-samhitā pp. 33-40 and Mr. Jayasval in JBORS. vol. 14, p. 397 (F). A Jyotir-Gärgya and a Brhad-Gārgya are quoted in the Smộticandrikā. The Nityācārapradipa (p. 20, B.I.S.) mentions Garga and Gārgya separately as smștikāras.
