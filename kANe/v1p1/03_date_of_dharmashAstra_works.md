03 Date of Dharmaśāstra works


3. When Dharmasastra works were first composed 

The important question is to find out when formal treatises on dharma began to be composed. It is not possible to give a definite answer to this question. The Nirukta (III. 4-5) shows that long before Yaska heated controversies had raged on various questions of inheritance, such as the exclusion of daughters by suns and the rights of the appointed daughter (putrikā ). It is very likely that these discussions had found their way in formal works and were not merely confined to the meetings of the learned. The manner in which Yaska writes suggests that he is referring to works in which certain Vedic verses had been cited in support of particular doctrines about inheritances. It is further a remarkable thing that in connection with the topic of inheritance Yāska quotes a verse, calls it a Sloka and distinguishes it from a ľk.47 This makes it probable that works dealing with topics of dharma existed either composed in the sloka metre or containing slokas. Scholars like Bichler would say that the verses were part of the floating mass of mnemonic verses, the existence of which he postulates without very convincing or cogent arguments in his Introduction to the Manusmrti (S. B. E. vol. 25 Intro.xc). If works dealing with topics of Tharmu oxisted before Yáska, a high

vol. 25, LXI ( footnote) for Buhler's view refuting Roto's opinion that 

the whole discussion in the Nirukta is an interpolation, 47 तदेतहक्लोकाभ्यामभ्युक्तम्। अङ्गादकात्सम्भवसि...स जीव शरदः शतम् ।। 

अविशेषेण पुत्राणादायोभवति धर्मतः। मिथुनानां विसर्गादो मनुः स्वायम्भुवोब्रवीत् ।।. The first half of the verse 'Aigād-angat' occurs in. Br. Up. VI. 4.9 and in Kauşitaki Up. 2. 11 (three pädas) and the whole verse in Baud. Gs. and Aấv G§. and in mantra-patha II. 11. 33. The Māpavagrhyasutra (I. 18. 1) provides that the verse 'angad-angat,' quoted io n. 47, was to be muttered over the son's head after the father returned from a journey. It may be noted that in the extant Manusmrti 

Manuh SvāyambhuvoSbravīt' occurs in IX. 158 and the words * Manurāha Prajāpatih' occur in X. 78 and the words' tan-Manoranu. sasanam'occur in VIII. 139 and 279 and in IX. 239. This shows that the śloka quoted by the Nirukta might have been contained in some Smrti work like the extant Manusmrti. Vide Manu IX. 133 and 139 for the underlying idea that there is no difference between the son's son and the daughter's son and therefore between sop and daughter. 

As stated in Gautama, Manu, Yaj. and others, Srutt and Smrti are the most authoritative sources of Dharma and Manusmrti II. 10 states that Smsti Is Dbarmasastra. This last in a broad sense comprises the Gșhya and Dharmasūtras, metrical smstis like those of Mann. Yaj, Brhaspati, Parāśara, commentaries on them and digests | pibandhas).

antiquity will have to be predicated for them. The high antiquity of works on dharmaśāstru follows from other weighty considerations. It will be seen later on that the extant dharma sūtras of Gautama, Bauchāyana and Āpastamba certainly belong to the period between 600 to 300 B. C. Gautama 48 speaks of dharmaśāstras and the word dharmaśāstra occurs in Baudhāyana also (IV. 5.9). Baudhāyana speaks of a dharma pūthaka (I. i. 9.). Besides, Gautama quotes in numerous places the views of others in the words 'ityeke' (e. g. II. 15, II, 58, III. 1, IV. 21, VII. 23). He refers to Manu" in one place and to ' Ācāryas' in several places (III. 35, IV.18 ). Baudhāyana mentions by name several writers on dharma, viz. Aupajanghani, Kātya, Kāśyapa, Gautama, Maudgalya and Hārita. Apastamba also cites the views of numerous sages such as those of Eka, Kanva, Kautsa, Härita and others. There is a Vārtika which speaks of Dharmaśātraso. Jaimini speaks of the duties of a Sūdra as laid down in the dharmaśātrasi. Patañjali shows that in his days dharmasūtrus existed and that their authority was very high, being next to the coniniandments of Gods. He quotes

The words Damat gufa may also mean ' A king (ruler) does not command' &c. The Gaut. Db. S. IX. 53 provides that a learned brāhmaṇa may approach a ruler for his own 'yogakşema'. Similarly. the Mahābhāşya itself (Vol. III. p. 7) on Vārtika 9 on Pān. VI. 1.2 bas the words SEAT 37iigía TAITATA149691 3 eraia,' where 'Isvara' can only mean 'king or ruler.' Panini in I, 4. 97 (adhir. iśvale) and in II. 3. 39 uses Isvara in the sense of ruler or owner. There is not much to choose between the two senses.

History of Dharmaśāstra 

verses and dogmas that have their counterparts in the dharma sūtras52. The foregoing discussion establishes that works on the dharmaśāstra existed prior to Yāska or et least prior to the period 600-300 B. C. and in the 2nd century B. C. they had attained a position of suprenie authority in regulating the conduct of men. 

In this book the whole of the extant literature on dharma will be dealt with as follows :-First come the dharmasūtras, some of which like those of Āpastamba, Hiranykesin and Baudhāyana form part of a larger Sūtra collection, while there are others like those of Gautama and Vasistha which do not form part of a larger collection; some dharmaxūtras like that of Visnu are, in their extant from, comparatively later in date than other sūlra works; some sūtru works like those of Sankha-Likhita and Paithinasi are known only from quotations. Then early metrical smộtis like those of Manu and Yājñavalkya will be taken up for discussion; then later versified smrtis like that of Närada ; there are many smộti works like those of Brhaspati and Kātyāyana that are known only from quotations. The two epics, the Maha bhārata and the Rāmāyana, and the Purānas also have played a great part in the development of the Dharmaśāstra. The commentaries on the smộtis, such as those of Viśvarūpa, Medha tithi, Vijñāeśvara, Aparārka, Haradatta will be next passed in review and then the digests on alarmu such as the works of Hemādri, Todaramalla, Nilakantha and others.

does not subscribe to the view of Max Müller (H. A. S. L. P. 68) and others that works in continuous Anustubh metre followed sūtra works 53. Our knowledge of the works of that period is so meagre that such a generalisation is most unjustifiable. Some works in the continuous sloka metre like the Manusmrti are certainly older than the Visnudharmasūtra and probably as old as, if not older than, the Vasisthadharmasūtra. One of the earliest extant dharmasūtras, that of Baudhāyana, contains long passages in the sloka metre, inany of which are quotations and even Āpastamba has a considerable number of verses in the śloka metre. This renders it highly probable that works in the śloka metro existed before them. Besides, a large literature on dharma existed in the days of A pastamba and Baudhayana which has not come down to us. In the absence of that literature 

it is futile to dogmatise on such a point. 

In volumes II to V both Srautasūtras and Gșhya-sūtras have been quoted and relied upon very frequently. In pp. 976-1255 of Volume II a comparatively full account was given of the Vedic sacrifices based on the Srautasūtras. But no account of the Grhyasūtras in general was given in any of the five volumes of the History of Dharmaśāstra. Therefore, a brief statement on the gļhyasūtras with references to some printed editions is set out below and no attempt will be made to settle their chronology. The chronology of the Dharmaśāstra given later on may be held applicable to the Gșhyasūtras also with some unimportant modi fications. The Gșhyasūtras often refer to the Srautasūtras of their schools e. g. the Āśv. Gr, begins'uktāni vaitānikāni gļhyāni vāksyāmah' (the Srauta sacrifices have been already expounded; we shall now expound the gļhya rites ). Vitāna means, acc. to Amarakośa, 'kratu '(vedic sacrifice) and 'vistāra'. Gșhya is derived from 'gļha' (which means 'house or a shed' or wife' ('gļhini gặhamucyate' in Sānti-parva 144:6 Ch ed.). The grhya fire was set up by a man at or after marriage or on partition of inheritance. Vide Āśv. Gị. S. I. 61 (Pänigrahaņād gphyam paricaret), H. of Dh. Vol. II p. 678 note 1615 for other texts; Āp. Dh. S. II.7. 17. 16 'Sarvesu vștteşu sarvataḥ samava dāya. präśniyād-yādthoktam ' has in view An. Gr. S. VIII.2 1. (khanda ). 9. Similarly, Ap. Dh. S. I. 1. 14. 16, II. 2. 3.

17, II. 2.5.4. refer to provisions in Āp. Gș. S. 53 a Similarly, a gļhyasūtra has often in view the Dharmasūtra of its carana; e. g. Āp. Gr. 8. 21. 1. (māsisraddhasyäparapakşe yathopadeśam kālāḥ ) has in view Āp. Dh. S. II. 7. 16. 4-21. It may be noted that Āp. Gr. IV. 11. 16-17 ( Pālāso dando...upadiśānti ) occur as Āp. Dh. S. I. 1. 2. 38. It may plausibly be argued that the extant Srauta, Gșhya and Dharmasūtras of certain caranas like those of Apastamba and Baudhayana were composed either by one and the same person or at least by father and son or grandfather and grandson and so on. But this would not be correct in the case of several Dharmasūtras. 

The grhyasūtras belong to the various recensions of the four vedas The gļhyasūtras translated in volumes XXIX and XXX of the Sacred Books of the East Series are in order Sänkhåyana, Āśvalāyana, Pāraskara,:Khādira, Gobhila, Hiranyakešin, Āpasta mba. The Dharmasūtras translated in Sacred Books of the East Vol. II, VII and XIV are those of Āpastamba, Gautama, Vişnu, Vasistha and Baudhāyana. The gļhyasūtras belonging to the Rgveda are : (1) Āśvalāyana gr. s., published with Nārā yapa's commentary by Nir. Press and in B. I. Series and with Anāvilā of Haradatta in Tri. S. S. (1923). This Gr. S. belongs to the sākala Säkhã and the last verse in the Sākhā of the Rg. is * Samānīva ākūtiḥ'; (2) The Sāňkhāyana Gę. S. (in six adhyāyas of which the last two appear to be later additions ) commented upon by Nārāyana and published in Indische Studion, Vol. XV. pp. 1-166, and by Dr. G. R. Sehgal with a learned Introduction (1960), New Delhi; (3) The Kauşitaka (often written as Kausitaki) Gr. S. edited by Mr. Ratna Gopal Bhatta (in the Benares S. Series, 1908 ) and by Dr. T. R. Chintamani, Madras, 1944 with the commentary of Bhavatrāta. These two belong to the Bāskala Sākhā of the Rgveda, the last verse of which 'is tac-cham yorāvsnimahe.' 

The Yajurveda has two recensions Krsna and Sukla. The former has come down to us in four schools viz. Taittiriya, Maitrāyaniya, Kathaka and Kapisthala-katha. The number of Srauta and Gșhya-sūtras belonging to the Krsnayajurveda is large. The more important of the Gr. Sutras are (1) Baudha

Gșhyatātparya-darśana of Sudarsanācārya; vide P. K. Gode about this last in ABORI (1956), vol. 37 p. 55. The Mantras required are collected in a collection called Mantrapātha 536 edited by M. Winternitz (Oxford, 1897). 

(4) Hiranyakeśigrhya ( also known as Satyāsādha Gș. S.) edited by Dr. Kirste at Vienna, 1889, with extracts from the com. of Mātrdatta and in the Anan. S. Series. The Mantras are given 

in full in the Gr. S. itself; 

(2) The Mänava-gphyasūtra (also called Maitrāyaniya Mānavagshya ) edited by Dr. Knauer and in the G. 0. Series with Astāvakra's bhāsya; the sutra is divided into two parts called puruşa ; the bhäsya calls the work Pūrana and ascribes it to Mānavācārya ;

536 This mantrapātha was most probably compiled before the Grhyasūtra 

as it forms prašnas 25 and 26 of the Āpastambīya-kalpa aud as the Ap.

(7) Kāthakagrhyasūtra, also called Carakagshya, Laugāksi grhya or Cārāyaniyagrhya, edited by Dr. Caland in D. A. V. College Series at Lahore in 1925 with extracts from three com mentaries, viz. Vivarana of Adityadarśana, Paddhati of Brāhmaṇa bala and bhāşya of Devapāla. Kashmirian tradition ascribes the work to Laugāksi. 

(8) Vārāha-gphya-sūtra. It belongs to the Vārāha sub division of Maitrāyaniyas. Many of its sūtras occur also in Mänava-gặhya-sūtra and Kāthakagshya. It was published in the G. O. Series ( 1920 ) and by Dr. Raghuvira (1922, Lahore ). 

(9) Agniveśa-gļhyasūtra, published in the Chowkhamba S. S., Vārāṇasi. 

The Gșhyasūtras belonging to the Sukla Yajurveda ( Mādhyandina and Kānva recensions ) are : 

(i) Pāraskara-grlıyasūtra (also called Kātiya gļ. s.) in three kāņdas; edited by Stenzler at Leipzig in 1876, printed with several commentaries both in the Kashi S. Series and by the Gujarati Press in Bombay. This gļhya has probably the largest number of commentaries, the earliest being those of Bhartryajña )53d and Karka ( called Bhāşya), 

I am inclined to hold that Páraskara is another name of Kātyāyana, 'Paraskara-prabhřtini; ca samjñāyām' Pāṇ. VI. I. 157, on which the Mahabhāsya says 'Paraskaro deśaḥ'; Katyāyana came probably from that country and was called Påraskara also. Nagojibhatta and other writers have assigned other meanings to that word by saying ' pāram karoti Pāraskarah.' 

(ii) Baijavāpagphya:-vide Procoodings and Transactions of the 4th Oriental Conference at Allahabad, Vol. Il pp. 59-67 where Pandit Bhagavad-datta gives a good deal of information and puts together on pp. 63-67 passages of Baijavāpa-gphya from 14 medieval works. Kumārilabhatta in Tantravārtika on P. M. 8. I. 3. 11 appears to refer to the work of Baijavāpa (or-pi) 36

4. The Grhya and Dharmasūtras

The gļhyasūtras belonging to the Sāmaveda are : 

(1) Gobhilagphyasūtra, published in the B. I. series ; published in the Calcutta Sanskrit series with the com. of Nārāyaṇa, edited by Chintamani Bhattācārya (1936). The mantras required in gļhya rites are collected in a Mantra brāhmaṇa and the sūtra mentions only the opening words, but where the mantras are not contained in the Mantrabrāhmana they are quoted in full; this mantrapātha called Mantra brāhmaṇa was most probably compiled before the Gobhila Gr. S. 

(2) The Khādiraghya-sútra, published in the Mysore Govt. Library Series with the com. of Rudraskanda, son of Nārāyana. This is based on the Gobhila Gș. S. and is an abridgement of it; 

(3) Jaiminiya-gļhya-sūtra, edited by Dr. Caland in the Punjab Oriental Series (1922); 

(4) The Drāhyāyaṇa-gļhya-sütra (published in Anan. series, Poona). 

The Atharvaveda has the Kausika-sūtra as its Grhya. which was edited by Prof. Bloomfield. Vide Prof. Belvalkar Presentation Vol. pp. 28-33 for a paper by Mr. O. G. Kashikar for corrections in it and a paper Kausikasūtra and the Atharva veda' by Prof. Edgerton in F. W. Thomas Presentation Vol. pp. 78-81. There are several commentaries on it. It devotes a large part of it to utpūtas and sūntis.
