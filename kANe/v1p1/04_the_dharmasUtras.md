4. The Dharmasutras It seems that originally many, though not all, of the dharma. siiras formed part of the Kalpasūtras and were studied in distinct sūtrucaranas. Some of the extant dharmasūtras here and there show in unmistakable terms that they presuppose the Gshyasūtra of the caraņa to which they belong. Compare Āp. Dh. S. I, 1. 4. 16 with Ap. Gș. S. I. 12 and II. 5; and Baud. Dh. S. II. 8. 20 with Baud. Gr. S. II. 11. 42 (and other sūtras ).54 The Dharmasūtras belonging to all sūtracaraṇas have not come down

History of Dharmaśāstra 

to us. There is no dharmasūtra completing the Āśvalāyana Srauta and Gșhyasūtras; no Mānavadharmasūtra has yet come to light, though the Mānava Srauta and Gșhya sūtras are extant; in the same way we have the Sankhāyana Srauta and Grhya sūtras, but no sānkhāyanadharmasūtra. It is only in the case of the Āpastamba, Hiraṇyakeśin and Baudhāyana Sūtracarañas that we have a complete kalpa tradition with its three components of Srauta, Gșhya and Dharma sūtras. The Tantravārtika of Kumārila contains very interesting observations on this point. It tells us that Gautama (dharmasūtra) and Gobhila (gļhyasūtra) were studied by the Chandogas (Sāmavedins), Vasistha ( dharmasūtra ) by the Rgvedins, the dharmasūtra of Sankha Likhita by the followers of Vājasaneya-samhitā and the sutras of Āpastamba and Baudhāyana by the followers of the Taittiriya Śākhā55, The Tantravārtika (p. 179 ) establishes it as a sido dhānta (on Jaimini I. 3. 11 ) that all the dharina and grhyrı sutras are authoritative for all Aryan people. From this it appears that, although originally all sūtracarañas might not have possessed dharmasūtras composed by the founder of the carana or ascribed to him, yet gradually certain dharmasūtras were specially taken over or appropriated by certain carañas. As the dharmasülras were mostly concerned with rules about the conduct of men as members of the Aryan community and did not deal with ritual of any kind, all dharmasūtras gradually became authoritative in all schools. 

The dharmasūtras were closely connected with the grhyasūtras in subjects and topics. Most of the Gșhyasūtras treat of the sacred domestic fire, the divisions of Gịhya sacrifices, the regular morning and evening oblations, sacrifices on now and full moon, sacrifices of cooked food, annual sacrifices, marriage, purnsavana, jātakarma, upanayana and other sarskūras, rules for students and snātuhas and holidays, śrāddha offerings, madhuparka. In most cases the Gșhyasūtras confine then solves principally to the various events of domestic life; they rarely give rules about the conduct of men, their rights, duties and responsi

bilities. The dharmasūtras also contain rules on some of the above topics such as marriage and the samskāras, rules for Brahmacarya and snātakas and holidays, on śrāddha and madhuparka. It is therefore not to be wondered at that in the Apastamba-gțhyasūtra the topics of the duties of the Brahmacārin and of the house-holder, of alithis and of śrūddha are meagrely treated as compared with the Āpastamba-dharmasūtra. The dharmasūtras very rarely describe the ritual of domestic life; they merely touch upon it; their scopo is wider and more ambi tious; their principal purpose is to dilate upon the rules of conduct. law and custom. Some sūtras are common to both the Āpast amba-grhya and the dharma sutra 56. Sometimes the grhyasūtra appears to refer to the dharmasūtra57. There are certain points which distinguish the dharmasūtras ( the more ancient of them at least ) from smrtis : (a) Many dharmasūtras are either parts of the Kalpa belonging to each sūtracarana or are intimately connected with the grhyasūtras. (b) The dharmasūtras some times betray some partiality in their Vedic quotations for the texts of that Veda to which they belong or in the caranas of which they are studied; (c) The authors of the older ) dharma sūtras do not claim to be inspired seers or superhuman being958. while the other smrtis such as those of Manu and Yājñavalkya are ascribed to Gods like Brahmā. (d) The dharmasutras are in prose or in mixed prose and verse; the other smrtis are in verse. (e) The language of the dharmasūtras is generally more archaic than that of the other smộtis. (f) The dharmasūtras do not proceed upon any orderly arrangement of topics, while tho other sirtis (even the oldest of them, viz. Manusmộti ) arrange their contents and treat of the subjects under three principal heads viz. ncūri, ryavahāra and prūyaścitta; (g) Most of the dharmasi tras are older than most of the other sınstis. 

Many of the technical terms used in the Gșhyasūtras and Dharmasutras are derived from the Sainhitās, Brāhmanas and Srautasūtras e. g. the following few technical words which occur in the Gșhya and Dharma sūtras' are so derived and references

are given in the H. of Dh. Vol. II where they are explained ; āghārau (p. 1051 n. 2360), Ajyabhāga (p. 1059 n. 2371), Abhi ghārana (p. 528 n), Avadāna (528, 1061 n), Upastarana (p. 1061 n), Pavitra ( 211 n., 1021 n), Paryagnikarana (p. 1120 n), (Pranītā p. 1022-23), Pratyabhighārana (p. 1053 n). The Āp. Dh. S. (I. 4. 12. 10 ) makes the interesting statement "religious rites were declared in the Brāhmaṇas, the texts of those rites have been lost, (but those texts ) can be inferred from the actual per formance (of the rites that are in vogue): "brāhmanoktā vidhayas teşām utsannāḥ pathāḥ prayogād-anumiyanto'. This shows that an early writer like Apastamba (who flourished some centuries before the Christian era ) was aware that Brāhmaṇa works had once described many of the gļhya rites, but that in his day such Brāhmaṇa texts had been lost.
