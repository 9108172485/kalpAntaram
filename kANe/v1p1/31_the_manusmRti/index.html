<li>The Manusmrti So many editions of this work have been published in India since 1813 ( when the Manusmrti was first published at Calcutta ), that it is not possible to name them. In this work the Nirnayasāgara edition with the commentary of Kulluka has been used throughout. Another edition of Manu well known on this side of India is that of the late V. N. Mandlik, who published several commentaries such as those of Medha tithi, Govindaraja and others. The Manusmrti has been tran slated into English several times. The best known transla tion is that of Dr. Bühler in the S. B. E. series (vol. 25). Dr. Bühler also added an exhuustive and very scholarly intro duction to his translation and dealt with numerous problems connected with the Manusmrti.</li>
</ol>
<p>In the Rgveda the rgis often speak of Manu as &lsquo;father&rsquo; (in Rg. I. 80. 16, I. 114. 2, VIII. 63. 1 ) without expressly saying</p>
<p>of whom.&rsquo; But in Rg. II. 33. 13 the sage speaks of Manu 88 &lsquo;our father&rsquo; (Yāni Mavur-avrnitā pitā nah). The word Manu in several cases (from the nominative to the locative) and in componnd words like Manu-jāta,&rsquo; &lsquo;Manu-pritāsah&rsquo; and Manur-hita&rsquo; occur hundreds of times. In Rg. VIII. 30. 3 the prayer is &lsquo;O Gods! May you protect us, help us, speak in our favour, may you not lead us far from the ancestral path of Manu.&rsquo; In Rg. I. 36. 19 the poet says &lsquo;0&rsquo; Agnil Manu established you as a light for the people.&rsquo; The gods are often referred to as those to whom Manu offered sacrifices (as in æg. V. 35. 15, VIII. 30. 2, X. 36. 10, X. 65. 14). In æg. VIII. 23. 17 it is said . Kāvya Uśanas is said to have established Agni for Manu.&rsquo; In æg. VIII. 98. 6 Indra is spoken of as the sha tterer of many cities of the asuras ), as the killer of dasyu and as bringing prosperity to Manu and as the lord of Heaven. The two sūktas (Rg. X. 61 and 62 are ascribed in the Anivkra maụi to Nābhānedistha, son of Manu, the refrain in the first four verses being &lsquo;O&rsquo; intelligent (Angirases ) Hecept</p>

<p>me, the son of Manu, as officiating priest). It may be noted that Nābhānedistha is mentioned in Rg. X. 61. 18 and descri bed as desirous (of securing cows ) and as praying loudly ( Nābhānedistho rapati pra venan). In Ry. X. 62.4 be is referred to as &ldquo;ayam Nābhā&rsquo; and in X. 62 Sāvarnya or Sāvarni is said to be Manu ( verse 11). In many of the verses of the æg. in which the word Manu occurs, commentators and translators often hold that the word Manu stands for &lsquo;Manusya&rsquo; (and not merely for Manu as an individual ). But it is clear that in some Rgveda verses at least Manu must be taken as an individual sage ; e. g. in Rg. I. 112. 16 a prayer is made to the Advins to come with help as they did in the past ages (purā ) in the case of Sayu, Atri and Manu. Simi. larly, in 1. 80. 16 reference is made to the sacrifice offered and the sacred verses recited by Atharvan, father Manu and sage Dadhyan in past ages (pūrvatha ). The rși of Sūktas 27-81 of Rg. VIII is said in the Anukramani to be Manu Vairagvata and Manu is mentioned in VIII. 27. 4 and 14, in VIII. 80. 2 ( thirty-three gods ure said to have been offered worship by Manu). On the two hymns (Rg. X. 61 and 62) the Ait. Br. ( 22. 9) tells the story of Nābhānedistha, son of Manu, who was excluded from a share in the paternal wealth by his brothers and explains the refrain &lsquo;pratigrbhạita mānavam sumedhasaḥ&rsquo; (in X. 62 ) as relating to that story.</p>
<p>It is impossible in the short space that can be spared to dilate at length on Manu as delineated in Sanskrit literature from the early Vedic times onwards. He is regarded in the early literature sometimes as the father of the human race ( so far at least as India is concerned ), as one of the very ancient sages, as having brought (or established ) Fire, as a semi-divine being who received from God himself the laws and regulations, as a king in the Kr̥ta yuga (Asvamedhika parva 4. 2 ), as the author of a work on Arthasūstra ( Drona parva 7.1). The Manusmști (VII. 42 ) itself states that Mana became king by his disciplined behaviour (vinaya).</p>
<p>In the Taittiriya Samhita and the Tāndya-mabā-brāh. mana it is said whatever Manu said is medicine &lsquo;.816 Taitti riya-Samhita (II. 1. 5. 6 ) also says that mankind is Manu&rsquo;s</p>

<p>( Manavyo hi prajāḥ). In the Taittiriya Samhitā (IIL. 1. 9. 4-5 ) and the Aitareya Brāhmana ( V, 14 ) we have the story of Manu dividing his wealth among his sons and of the exclu sion of his son Nābhānedistha. The Satapatha-brahmana (S. B. E. vol. 12 p. 216 ) gives us the story of Manu and the deluge. In the Nirukta (chap. III ) there is a discussion about the rights of sons and daughters. One of the views there propounded is that children of both sexes take their father&rsquo;s wealth and a rk and sloka are cited in support of that position.317 The sloka refers to the opinion of Manu Svāyam bhuva. It is noteworthy that that sloka is opposed to a rik, which means that the sloka is not Sruti but.is Smrti. $o before Yāska wrote tbere were smrti texts in verse in which Manu was spoken of as a lawgiver. We have seen how.Ganta ma and Vasistha quote the views of Manu and how. Apasta mba connects Manu with the promulgation of frāddhas ( 11.7. 16.1). The Mahābhārata in numerous places speaks of Mapa, sometimes as Manu simply, sometimes as Svāyambhuva Manu (Santi 21. 12.) and also as Prācetasa Madu (Santi, 57:48:). In the Mahābhārata (Sānti. chap. 336. 38-46) we are told how the Supreme Being composed a hundred thousand Slokas on dharing, how Manu Svāyambhuv.&amp; promulgated thosa dharmas and how Ubanas and Bfhaspati composed sdotros based on the work of Manu Svāyambbuva.318 In another place the account is slightly different and Manu does not figure thereiu. Sānti-parva (chap. 59. 80–85 ) describes how the original work of Brubmā on the three, Dhurma, Artha, and K’āma, in 100000 cbapters was successively reduced to 10000, 5000, 3000 and 1000 chap, respectively by Visalaksa, Indra, Bāhudantaka, Bșhaspati and Kūvya (Usanas). The prose introduction to the Nārada-smrti says that Manu com posed in 100000 slokas, 1080 chap. and 24 prukaraṇas a Dha</p>

<p>rmaśāstra and imparted it to Nārada, who abridged it into 12000 verses and taught it to Mārkandeya, who in his turn .compressed it into 8000 slokas and passed it on to Sumati Bhargava, who again reduced it to 4000 slokas. The Nārada smrti then gives the first verse319 of that work which is a combination of the extant Manu I. 5-6 and says that vyava bāra was the 9th prakarana out of 24 in the original work of Manu. It will be noticed how this version differs from that of the Mahabhāratib wherein Nārada is altogether ignored. The extant Manusinști ( I. 32-33 ) narrates how from Brahma sprang Virāj, who produced Manu, from whom were born the Bages including Bhrgu and: Nārada, kow Brahmā taught the Māstra to Manu, who in his turu imparted it to the ten sages (1.58 ), how some greut gages approached Manu and sought instruction in the dhurmus of the varṇas and the intermedi ate, castes and how Manu told them that his pupil Borguwo uld impart to them the gistra (1:58-60).: This appearange is kept: up throughout the work. The sages interrupt: Bhf. gus discourse in several pluces (as in V. 1-2 and XII. 1-2:-). Mapu iṣ said to be omniscient (117)aud Maou:18: mentioned by name dozens of times in the work with the words : Magu rāba&rdquo; (1X. 158, X. 78 etc.), or · Manuf-abravıd”.or:&ldquo;Magar prubadanap.&rdquo; (VIII 139, 279, IX: 239, etc. )That the in troductory words in the Nārada-smrti are not spurious or a later addition follows from the remark of Medbātithi that. according to the Naradasinști, Prajapati composed to work in 100000 slukas which was abridged by Mauu sud others.390 No one should take very seriously these varying accounts even in the Mahabhūrata and in the Naradasmști, us they are intended to glorify some particular text or texts. According to the Bhuvisya-purdua as quoted in Hemādri, the Samskāra mayūkba and other works, there were four versions of the Svayambhuva sāstra composed by Bhrgu, Nārada, Brbaspati</p>

<p>and Argiras.821 So early a writer as Viśvarūpa cites verses from Manusmrti as those of Svayambhū (vide com. on Yāj. II. 73, 74, 83, 85, where Manu 8. 68, 70-71, 380 and 105-6 are respectively quoted as Svayambhu&rsquo;s ), while quotations from Bhrgu cited by Viśvarūpa (on Yāj. I. 187 and 252 ) are not found in the Mapusmrti. In the same way most of the verses quoted from Bhṛgu by Aparārka are not found in the Madu smrti. One verse which Aparārka quotes from Bhrgu (on Yāj. II. 96 ) speaks of the view contained therein as that of Manu.322</p>
<p>It is almost impossible to say who composed the Mapu smrti. It goes without saying that the mythical Manu, proge mitor of mankind even in the Rgveda, could not have composed it. What motives could have induced the upknown author to palm it off in the name of the mythical Mapy and to suppress his identity it is difficult to say. One motive may have been to invest the work with a halo of antiquity and authoritative ness. Bühler following Max Müller says (SBE vol. 25 p. XVIII) that the Manusmrti is based on or is a recast of an ancient dharmasūtra, viz. that of the Mānavacarana. The ques tion whether the Mānavadharmasūtra existed has been disco Boed above ( sec. 13, pp. 141-149 ). Buhler bimself candidly admits (SBE vol. 25, p. XXIII) that the recovery of the writings of the Mānavas has not only not furnished any facto in support of the alleged relation between the Mānavadharma sutra and the Manusmrti, but on the contrary has raised difficulties, as the doctrines of the Mānavagļhyasūtra (edited by Dr. Knauer) differ very considerably from those of the Maqusmrti. To take only a few examples : Mānava Gr. S. II. 12. 1-2 are opposed to Manu 3.1; Mūnava Gr. $. I. 4. 7 to Manu 4.95; Mānava Gr. S. I. 20.1 to Manu 2.34 ; Mānava Gr. 8. I. 21. 1 to Manu 2.35; Mānava Gr. $. I. 22. 1 to Manu 2. 36 ; Mānava Gr. S. II. 12. 1-2 to Manu 3. 84-86. Besides, there is nothing in our Manu corresponding to the Vināyakaśānti in the Mānavagļhya (II. 14 ) nor to the tests for selecting . bride prescribed in Mānava Gr. S. I. 7.9, which corresponds to</p>

<p>Asvalāyana Gṛ. S. I. 5. 5-6. Dr. Caland points out (R. und S. p. 17 ) that, though single verses of the Manusmrti tally with the Srāddhakalpa of the Mānava School, yet the descrip tions of funeral rites widely differ in the two works. There are no doubt some parallels as pointed out by Bradke (in ZDMG, vol. 36, pp. 417-477). There is one circumstance about the authorship of the Manusmrti that deserves to be noted. The Mahābhārata 323 seems to distinguish between Svāyambhuva Manu and Prācetasa Manu. The former is said to be the pro mulgator of dharmaśāstra and the latter of arthaśāstra (or politics ). For example, Santi 21. 12 speaks of Svāyambhuva Manu and Santi 57. 43 and 58. 2 speak of prācetasa as an author on rājuśāstra or rājadharma. In some places Manu alone without any epithet is associated with rājadharma or Arthavidyā. It is not unlikely that originally there were two distinct works, one on dharma and the other on arthasāstra, attributed to Manu. When the Kautiliya speaks of tbe Māne Vas, it probably refers to the work on politics attributed to Prācetasa Manu. It is extremely doubtful whether Rāja. sekhara, when he mentions the several views on the number of vidyās (including that of the Mānavas, that they were three), had the Arthasāstra of the Mānavas before him or only copied a passage from Kautilya (vide KĀvyamimāṁsā p. 4). It is not unlikely that the work on dharma attributed to Menu may have contained general directions on the duties of kings. It is therefore (i. e. because there were two different works on dharma and arthagāstra attributed to Manu ) that the views ascribed to the Mānavas hy the Kauṭiliya are not found word for word in the extant Manusmrti. One may hazard the conjecture that the author of the Manusmrti, wbo ever he might have been, combined in his work the informa tion contained in the two works on dharma and arthasāstra and supplanted both the earlier works and that this result had not been either accomplished at the time when the Kauti liya was composed or was then quite recent. In the extant Manusmrti, the work is ascribed to Svāymbhuva Manu and then six other Manus, of whom Prācetasa is not one, are enu merated ( I. 62).</p>

<p>The extant Manusmrti is divided into twelve adhyāyas and contains 2694 slokas. Dr. Jolly&rsquo;s edition (published in 1895 ) prepared after collating numerous mss. and printed editions contains only one sloka more. The Manusmṛti is written in a simple and flowing style. It generally agrees with Panini&rsquo;s system, though it contains some deviations from it as in the verse &lsquo;sāksinah santi metyuktvā&rsquo; ( 8. 57). The foregoing pages have sufficiently shown how it agrees closely with the doctrines contained in the Dharmasūtras of Gautama, Baudhāyana, Anastamba. We have also seen how numerous verses are common to the dharmasūtras of Vagistha and Viṣṇu and the Manuemrti. The Kautilīya also exhibits remarkable agreement with the Manusmrti in phraseology and doctri Des.824 : What conclusions are to be drawn from this will be discussed later on. Some verses are repeated, e. g. V. 164 165 are the same as IX. 30 and 29. The contents of the Manu: smrti may be briefly summarised as follows: (I) Sages ap proach Manu for instruction in the dharmas of the varṇas; Manu describes the creation of the world from the self-existent God more or les in the Saṅkhya manner; the creation of Virāj, of Manu from Viraj, of ten sages from Manu ; creation of various beings, men, beasts, birds etc.; Brahimā imparts Dharmaśāstra to Manu, who teaches the sages; Manu bids Bhrgu to instruct the sages in dharını ; six other Manus sprang from Svāyambhuva Manu; units of time from nimesa to year, the four yugas and their twilights; one thousand yugas equal a day of Brahmā; extent of manvantara; pra laya; successive decline of dharma in the four yugas; diffe rent dharmas and goals in the four yugas; the special privi leges and duties of the four varṇas; eulogy of Brāhmaṇas and of the śāstra of Manu; ācāra is the highest dharma; table of contents of the whole sāstra ; (II) definition of dharmo, sour 324 Compare p oate TouthTerut tearaava tanto alten</p>

<p>The extent of the literature known to Manu was con siderable. He mentions the three Vedas and the Atharva veda is spoken of as the Atharva girasi Sruti ( XI. 33). He refers to Aranyaka (IV. 123 ). The Vedārgas are said to be six (III. 185 ) and they are often referred to without stating the number ( II. 141, IV. 98 ). He speaks of dharma śāstra (II. 10) and also knew many dharmaśāstras (III. 232). By dharmapāthaka (XII. 111 ) he probably means one who has studied dharmaśāstras. He mentions several authors on dharmaśāstra, viz. Atri, the son of Utathya (i. e. Gautama according to commentators ), Bhrgu and Saunaka (all these in III. 16), Vasistha (on the rate of interest in VIII. 140 which agres with Vasisthadharmasūtra II. 50), Vaikhānasa. mata (in VI. 1). He mentions Ākhyānas, Itihāsa, Purāṇas and Khilas (III. 232 ). He speaks of bruhna as described in the Vedānta (in IV. 83 and 94 ) and is probably thinking of the Upaniṣads. That he knew some generally accepted works opposed to the teaching of the Vedas is quite clear from his reference to Veda bāhyāḥ smṣtayaḥ&rsquo; (XII. 95). He is probably referring to the writings of the Bauddbas, Jainas and others. He speaks of heretics and their guilds (IV. 30 and 61 ). He refers to atheism and calumny of the Vedas (IV. 163 ) and of various tongues spoken among men (IV. 332 ). He frequently refers to the views of others in the words &ldquo;kecit” in III, 53, 261, IX. 32, &rsquo;eke&rsquo; in X. 10, XI. 45, &lsquo;apare&rsquo; and &lsquo;anye&rsquo;in III. 261. In IX. 49 Manu refers to Gāthās of Vāyu and it appears that at least verses IX. 43-45 are quotations. Yoga had been well developed at the time of the Manu-smrti. In Manu VI. 70 it is laid dowu that even three Pranayāmas when accompanied by Omkāras and the Vyābstis constitute the highest tu pas and that by prānāyāma all the aberrations of the senses (including the mind ) are destroyed. In VI. 72 are briefly indicated the results of Prāṣāyāma, Pratyābāra ( withdrawal of the sepse organsdrom the objects of sense ), Dhāraṇā (the holding of the minetto certain spot or a certain point such as the tip of one&rsquo;s nose</p>

<p>and Dhyāna (contemplation) i. e. one-pointedness of the apprehension of the object contempluted upon. Vide H. of Dh. Vol. V. pp. 1444-49 for explanation of Pratyābāra, Dbā ranā, Dhyāna. The word Dhyānayoga occurs in Manu VI. 73 and 79 and it is stated that by dhyānayoga, one realizes brahman. The words &lsquo;Dhyānayoga,&rsquo; &lsquo;Dhāraḥā&rsquo; and others occur in some of the Upanisads as illustrated in the note325 below. The Yogasūtra is not later than the 2nd or 3rd century A. D. ; vide H. of Dh. vol. V, pp. 1395-98, but the Upaniṣads had developed much of the yoga technique centuries before the Yogasūtras and the Manusmrti is based on the Upaniṣads and not on the Yogasūtra.</p>
<p>Numerous interesting and difficult problems are conne cted with the Manusmrti. Bühler in his elaborate introduc tion (S. B. E. vol. 25) exhaustively deals with these problems. It is not possible to go at great length into those questions here. A separate volume would be required to deal with the problems raised by Biihler and to examine the arguments of Bühler, Hopkins and others who have written on them. Only a brief discussion of some of these problems can be attempted.</p>
<p>Bühler takes considerable pains to refute the claims of Manu to be regarded as the first legislator (S. B. E. vol. 25 pp. XXIII-XXX). But no serious refutation of the claim is really needed. The very extent of the literature known to the Manusmrti and the mention of several writers on dharma sāstra by name are sufficient to negative that claim.</p>
<p>Bühler devotes a great deal of space to the consideration of the question as to what circumstances led to the substitu tion of a universally binding Mānava-dharmaśāstra for the manuals of the Vedic schools (8. B. E. vol. 25 pr. XLVI-LVI)</p>

<p>and as to why the special law schools selected just the Mūna vadharmasūtra among the large number of similar works for the basis of their studies (ibid. pp. LVII-LXV ). Bühler then considers the question how the Mānavadharmasūtra was con verted into the present Manusirti. Bühler concedes that the last is a problein of great difficulty and admits of an approxi mate solution only. The discussion of all these questions by Bühler is extremely thought-provoking and brilliant in many places, though it must be said with great respect that the arguments are often a priori and gavour more or less of speci al pleading. As I question the very foundation of Bühler&rsquo;s edifice ( viz, the actual existence of a Mānava-dharmasūtra ), it would be futile for me to enter into a discussion of the pro blems referred to above.</p>
<p>Jolly in Introduction to the Vishudharinasūtra (p. XXYII n. 3) admits that Manu has little in common with the Mānava grhya, both in mantras and otherwise, Manu is recognised as an ancient writer on Dharmasastra in the Dharmasūtras. Gaut. Dh. S. 21. 7 refers to Manu&rsquo;s view that three out of the five mortal sins ( Mahāpātakus ) could uot be wiped out except by death ( this has a counterpart in the extant Manu smrti in XI. 89, 90, 103-4). The Ap. Dh. S. II. 6. 13. 11 refers to the tradition that Manu divided family property among his sons and also to the tradition (in II. 7. 16. 1 ) that Manu was the founder of the institution of Srāddha rites. Manu is called Srāddhadeva&rsquo; in Bralımānila-purāna III. 59. 38. The Baud. Dh. S. also pientions Manu&rsquo;s division of pro perty among his sons, refers to Maru&rsquo;s opinion that the father is a sinner if he does not arrange a marriage for his daughter within three years after her first monthly illness (IV.1.14) and further that the Aghamarsana hymn (Rg. X. 190. 1-3) is declared by Manu as a penance for all sing ( Baud. Dh. S. IV. 2. 19 20). This reflects Madu XI. 260. The Vas. Dh. S. in numerous places mentions. Mānaram slokam&rsquo; or simply &ldquo;Mānavam&rsquo;, besides verses containing words like Manuh prāha&rsquo; (in XI. 23 ) or Mannr-āha prajāpatili&rsquo; (in Vas. XII. 16 ), &lsquo;abravin-manuh (in Manusmrti V.41 and in Vas. IV. 6). This question of the relation of the Manusmrti and Vas. Dh. S. has been dealt with at some length above (pp. 99-103/</p>

<p>An extensive literature327 has accumulated in modern times about Manu and the Manusmrti, about the relation of the Manusinfti to the Dharmasūtras, to the Mahabharata, to the Arthaśāstra of Kautilya and about the development and spread of his doctrines to countries in South-East Asia. The present author has read some of it, but he cannot expatiate on all the topics about Manu in one volume of the History of Dharmuśāstra.</p>
<p>In ancient times it was held to be the king&rsquo;s duty328 to protect the kingdom and the people, to see that the rules of var nus and āśrumas were carried out by them, to make them conform to the dictates of Sūstra if they swerved from them, to punish the wicked and to dispense justice. The Arthaśāstru says &lsquo;people of the four vurnals and in the ( different ) diśramas protected by the king with the Rod (of punishment ) and attached to the actions prescribed as their respective) duties keep to the paths appropriate to them.&rsquo; Kautilya (in Artha sāstra III. 1. 38 ) calls the king Dharına pravartaka&rsquo; (pro pounder or promulgator of Dharma ). Many works (parti. cularly the Mahabharata ) hold that all dharmas and all vidyās</p>

<p>abide in Rājadharma, that the welfare of the people depends on the king (Santiparva 141. 9 ). Though the general tendency was to say that Dharma progressively declines in each of the four yuzas, yet this idea 32&rsquo; was not universal. The Mahabharata and the Manusmrti state (in IX. 301) that conditions described about the four yugas are not immutably fixed parts of Time, but it is the ruler (who by conducting himself properly ) can create the conditions of even Kr̥tayuga in what common people call Kaliyuga. There is a great difference between ancient societies (like those in India ) and some modern western societies. In several modern societies there are legislatures that lay down many laws to be observed by the people. In ancient times (in India ), the legislative activity of the ruler was extremely limited. Besides, India was divided into many kingdoms and great conflict of laws might have arisen. Moreover, there was no single ruler who could have legislated for the whole of India, even if the task of legislation was attemp ted.

<p>the usages of the country and that if the king decides causes by his fiat when there is in existence a Sūstric text, it leads him away from heaveu, it brings danger to him from enemies and reduces the span of his life. Manu (VII. 13 ) laid down that since the ruler has in him the glory of eight deities (Indra, Vāyu, the Sun, Yama, Agni, Varuna, the Moon and Kubera ) whatever rules as regards desirable matters he (the king) established, whatever rules he makes about undesirable actions should not be transgressed by the people. Medha tithi and other commentators expressly state that the ruler could not inake a rule opposed to the Sāstras and the long standing usages of the people. Therefore, changes in the practices of the people could be provided only by resorting to such devices as the Kalivarjya topics (indicated in H. of Dh. III. pp. 885–968 ) or by composing fresh sastras acceptable to the learned and the leaders of people or by saying that in the four different yugas four different smrtis were predominant as stated in Parāśara-smrti (I. 24). Manu (IV. 176 ) says &lsquo;One381 should abandon what was once) Dharma, if it ends in unha ppiness or it has become hateful to the people&rsquo; and Yāj. (I. 156 ) also remarks &lsquo;what was once ) allowed to be Dharma should not be practised, if people have come to hate it and it does not lead to Heaven.&rsquo; The Viṣṇu-Purina (III. 11. 7 says the same thing. It is very rare to find one Smrtikāra expressly stating that he dissents from the views of other named smrtikāras. Yaj. (I. 56 ) remarks &lsquo;what is said (by some) that persons of the twice-born classes can marry a sūdra woman is not my view,&rsquo; Manu (in III. 13) allows a brāhmana to marry a sudra woman, but in the following ver ses (III. 14–19) he severely condemns such marriages. That means he condemned the practices of a former age. Similarly, the practice of niyoga ( appointment of a brother-in law to procreate a son on the widow of a sonless person ) was set out at some length by Manu in IX. 53-62, but immediately</p>

<p>afterwards he condemns it (in IX. 64-68)337 as beastly (paśu dharma&rsquo; in IX. 66 ) and waters down the whole idea by say ing (IX. 69 ) that, when after the betrothal of a girl, the selected bridegroom dies (before actual marriage), then the brother of the deceased should marry that gir). Bșhaspati refers to these passages of Manu by saying that Manu descri. bed the procedure of niyoga but ultimately he himself for bade it ( vide Bșhaspati quoted by Aparārka p. 97 (on Yāj. I.</p>

<p>Confusion is caused by the fact that ancient texts refer to Svayambhuva Manu, Prācetasa Manu and Manu simply. To take first the Manusmrti itself. The views of Svāyam bhuva Manu are mentioned in Manu VI. 54 ( on the vessels to be used by ascetics ), VIII. 124 (the parts of the body where corporal punishment was to be administered in the case of all offenders except brāhmanas ), IX. 158 (on the twelve varieties of sons such as arrasa, ksctraja &amp;c.). In the first two cases the verb abravit&rsquo; is used and in the 3rd āha&rsquo;. No Manu is cited in chapters II and VII. In Manu IX. 138 the etymo. logy of the word &lsquo;putra&rsquo; is attributed to Svayambhuva (Manu not being added ). The words &rsquo;tan-manor anuśāsanam occur in VIII. 139, 279 and IX, 239. The words &lsquo;Manur abravīt&rsquo; occur many times, as in III. 150 and 222, IV, 103, V.</p>

X. 40.2 (ko vām sayutri vidhaveva devaram ) as an indication of the practice of niyoga in those far-off agos. Further, it is found that Viśvarūpa op Yaj.

He boldly asserts that Vyasa&rsquo;s procreating sons from the wives of Vicitravirya should be condemned like the marriage of Draupadi with five brothers. Ho provides that niyoga was allowed only for kings when the dynasty would have como to an end if there were no 800. He further says that the Vedic Mantra (X. 40. 2) should be explained as referring only to Sūdras, and quotes two verses of Vrddha-Manu viz.

<p>41 and 131, VIII. 168, 242, 339, IX. 182 and X. 63. In Manu smrti IX, 17 Manu is said to have consigned certain special matters to women in general (Manur-akalpayat). Manu Prajāpati is mentioned in X. 78 and in XII. 123 it is stated that the highest Purusa is called by some as Manu Prajāpati. I have not been able to find in the Manusmrti any mention of Prācetasa Manu as having said something, but in I. 35 among the ten Prajāpatis that primeval Manu (son of Virāj) created Pracetas is one. Therefore, it boils down to this that in the 2684 verses of the Manusmrti (in the Nir. edition ) Manu (whether simply as Manu or as Svāyambhuva or as Prajā pati ) is mentioned only about twenty times. In many of these cases the words Mapurāha&rsquo; or Manur-abravit&rsquo; or Manor-anuśāsanam&rsquo;are&rsquo; padapūrana&rsquo;. The earliest ex tant commentator ( Medhātithi ) on Manu IV. 103333 expressly says &lsquo;Manugrahanam slokapūraṇārtham, vikalpārtham-anye.&rsquo; This shows that there was at least among those who could read and understand the Manusmrti, no idea about deceiving anybody and that learned people at least did not understand the words as meaning that the primeval Manu had said so. The general tendency in the Manusmrti is to have a complete proposition or idea (and not more or less ) in one verse of 32 syllables. In several cases where that seemed difficult these words were added as &lsquo;padding.&rsquo; In the few cases where great conflict of views is expressed in the extant Manusmrti, the words. Manurabravīt&rsquo;or Manurāha &lsquo;or · Manor-anuśāsanam do not occur. For example, as to the propriety of a brābma ụa marrying a woman of the sūdra class the opinions of four sages are mentioned (in Manu III. 16 ). But no words like</p>
<p>• Manu svāyambhuva&rsquo; or Manur-abravit&rsquo; occur there. The opinion of the extant Manusmrti is that by marrying a sūdra woman a brāhmana falls into naraka (hell) and by procre ating a son from her he loses his status as a brāhmana ( Manu III. 17 ), while Bhșgu&rsquo;s view seems to be that a brābmana be comes a condemned sinner by having a child (son or daugh ter ) from her. If the entire extant Manusmrti proceeds from Bhrgu, pupil of the primeval Manu, the Bhrgu (in III. 16 ) seems to be a different person altogether. It may be noted that Aparārka on Yāj. II. 96 (p. 696 ) quotes a verse of Brgy</p>

<p>on ordeals in which the view of Manu is stated.334 That means that there was a work of Bhrgu before Aparārka in which Manu was cited. There are only two cases (in the present author&rsquo;s opinion ) where Manu&rsquo;s views are set out and where he may be said to assert his views as against those of others. One is connected with the question of the śrāddha to be offered to three ancestors, when the performer&rsquo;s father and great grand-father are dead, but the grand-father is alive. In this Case Manu gives two alternatives in III. 221-222. The Kalpa taru on Srāddha (p. 240 ) states three views about this ma tter. The other case is about eating the flesh of animals ( dis cussed at length in the Manusmṛti in V. 26-56 ). The general tenor of the extant Manusmrti is against flesh-eating, but there was Vedic authority for offering flesh on certain occa sions; therefore, Manu allows the killing of animals only on four occasions (in Madhuparka, in Yajña, in Srāddhas and rites in honour of gods ) and forbids it in other cases ( in V. 41. )</p>
<p>E. W. Hopkins, in his paper on · Professed quotations from Manu found in the Mahābhārata&rsquo; in J. A. O. S. Vol. XI. pp. 239-275 indulges in some very strongly worded and unca lled-for criticism of the extant Manusmrti and of the views attributed to Manu in the Mahābhārata and in later legal and other works. A volume would be required to refute the one sided remarks of Hopkins. But a few samples must be given. On p. 268 he observes &rsquo;the Sāstram was in great part collated between the time when the bulk of the epic was composed and its final completion, that previous to its collation there had existed a vast number of sententious remarks, proverbial wisdom, rules of morality etc. which were ascribed, not to this treatise of Manu at all, but to the ancient hero Manu as a type of godly wisdom. These I conceive to have floated about in the mouths of the people, not brought together but all loosely quoted as laws or sayings of Manu and these sayings were afterwards welded into one with the laws of a particular text (? sect) called the Mānavas. &hellip; &hellip; I fancy this sect built up their ācāra ( usages ) and Kuladharma ( family law ) out of their own heads, not ascribing them to Manu</p>

<p>Hopkins is obsessed by the occurrence of words like Manura bravit&rsquo; in the Manusmṛti and asks “if Manu says all, why emphasize a few ? According to my theory these Manu verses found in the Manu treatise were simply caught up and drawn from the hearsay of the whole Brahmana worlds. Doctrines utterly at variance with the Mānava treatise are palmed off upon us with “Manu said &quot; doctrines&rdquo;. It has been shown above that there are less than two dozen Manu said &lsquo;(to use Hopkin&rsquo;s phrase ) verses in about 2700 verses of the extant Manu and most of them do not at all teach doctri nes at variance with the Mānava treatise. This is a specimen of what some Western Scholars on account of preconceived base less notions write about Indian works and Indian people. On p. 270 he winds up his diatribe in the following words &lsquo;in my opinion the devotees of the legal Sāstra were more knaves than fools.&rsquo; There is no need to criticize these baseless and purely subjective remarks and wild theories about thousands of floating Sanskrit verses among people thousands of years ago, their being welded into one śāstra and new customs star ted on the basis of these verses by a sect like the Mānavas. Apart from the Manusmrti (in which phrases like &lsquo;Manur abravit occur a number of times ) such references do not occur at all in Yāj., there are only a few places in Nārada where such phrases occur and in other early smṛtis also there are only a few such references. Some later smṛtis do mention Manu in some cases. The reason is obvious. Manu was famed as the great law-giver of ancient times. Some practices and rules had changed in the course of centuries. Later writers wanted changes according to their lights to be recognised, but, if they bad stated them in their own names, little weight would have been attached to them, therefore they probably hit upon the plan of saying in some cases that the view propounded by them had the authority of Manu. Hammurabi professed to have received laws from the Sun. Prophets of several religions profess that what they say is inspired by God Himself. Luther, who rebelled against the authority of the Pope, denou nced Copernicus as a fool and relied upon the Bible for prov ing that it was the Sun that had motion and not the earth.

<p>tory verses occurring in grants of lands stating that he who deprives a donee of land given by former donors or by himself incurs great sin and falls into hell for long periods and so forth. Sometimes such verses are ascribed to Vyāsa (as in E. I.

I. Vol. XV. p. 249 ) the grant ends with the words &lsquo;atra ca dvau slokāvudāharanti&rsquo; and the two verses &lsquo;svadattām&rsquo; and &rsquo;nu visam&rsquo; are cited without anybody&rsquo;s name and which are Nos. 3 and 11 of the 43 imprecatory verses collected hy the present author on pp. 1271-77 of Vol. II. of H. of Dh. He himself points out that the extant Manu does not contain anything of this sort, that Mavu XI. 26 is the only condemnatory verse about theft of land which merely asserts that the man who steals the property dedicated to God or to brāhmanas has to subsist in his next birth on the leavi ngs of vultures. He also shows that the Mahābhārata (Santi 136. 2 ) exhorts the king not to fill his treasury by taking the property of those who perform sacrifices nor the property dedi cated to Gods. Yet he could not avoid the temptation of hav. ing &amp; fling at Manu in the words the fact that these quota tions are often ascribed to Vyāsa as well as to Manu points to the real worth of this Father Manu&rsquo;.

<p>Manu is not at fault. And such people are certainly not as blamable as men claiming to have direct messages from God in this matter.</p>
<p>There is a rather involved account in the extant Manu smrti about the creation of the world by Paramātman. Sages ask Manu to expound the Dharmas of Varnas and intermediate castes; the evolution is briefly described in the summary of the first chapter above. Towards the end of the first chap ter the Manusmrti winds up by stating the appropriate acti ons for the four varṇas, the pre-eminence of the brābmana and by proclaiming that the highest Dharma is ācāra as propoun ded by the Vedas and the Smrtis and that the Smști declares the Dharmas of countries, castes, families, heretical sects and of ganas (guilds and oligarchies ).</p>
<p>The description of Manu as the son of Brahmā and the primeval promulgator of laws is a mere camouflage or disgu ise. The extant Manusmrti mentions such human authors as Atri, Utathyatanaya, Saunaka, Bhṛgu (all in III. 16 ), Vasi stha ( as laying down the proper rate of interest in VIII. 140); also mentions Smṛtis beyond the pale of the Veda ( XII. 95) and above all refers to dusyus who speak mlecchu languages and Arya languages such as Paundrakas, Odras, Kambojas, Yavanas, Pāradas, Pahlavas, Cinas, Sakas, Kirātas, Daradas and Khasas (X. 44-45). Similarly, the śāntiparva ( in chap. 65 )388 mentions in a dialogue between Indra and Māndhātp ( verses 13-14 quoted below) sixteen dasyu-like peoples and in verses 17-21 sets out the Dharmas that should be practised by those people described as living like dasyus. We know from the 13th Rock Edict of Asoka that he tried to propagate dhamma among Yona-kambojas, Nabhāka, Nābhapanti, the Andhras and Pāradas, Bhoja-pitenikas and in the 5th Rock Edict also he mentions Yona-Kambhojas, people of Gandhāra, the Rittikas, Pitenikas and other Western people. These references to people to the West of Aryāvarta would indicate that the extant Manusmrti is not older than about 200 B. C.</p>

<p>I shall now address myself to the discussion of the age of the Manusmrti from external and internal evidence. That ques tion is bound up with other problems, viz. whether there are earlier and later strata in the extant Manusmrti, whether the Manusmṛti was recast several times or once only, what relation exists between the Manusmrti and the Mahābhārata.</p>
<p>First the external evidence may be taken up. The bhā kya of Medhātithi is the earliest extant commentary on the Manusmrti and was composed about 900 A. D. as will be shown later on. The text commented upon by Medhā tithi was the same (barring a few various readings ) as the one we now posses 8. Therefore, long before 900 A. D. the Manusmṛti was the same as now. Viśvarūpa in his commentary on Yāj. quotes over two hundred verses of the Manusmrti either wholly or in part from all the twelve chapters beginn ing with the very first verse. The text that Viśvarūpa had before him was the same as the present Manusmrti and the verses were arranged in the game order as at present. Viśva rūpa quotes eight verses ( Manu XI. 108-115 ) from Manu (on Yāj. III. 262 ). Saṅkarācārya in his Vedāntasūtra-bhāgya quotes the Manusmști very frequently. For example, he quo tes Manu I. 5 and 21 (on V. S. I. 3. 28 ), I. 27 (on V. S. IV. 2. 6), II. 87 ( on V. S. III. 4. 38), X. 4 and 126 ( on V. S. I. 3. 36 ), XII. 91 and 105-6 (on V. S. II. 1 and 11 ). In his bhā sya on the Br. U. he quotes Manu dozens of times and calls the Manusmrti. Mānavam'337 (on Bṛ. U. I. 4. 17). He looks upon the Manusmrti as one of the authorities on which the author of the Vedāntasūtra relies.338 The Tantra vārtika of Kumārila stands in a special relation to the. Manusmrti. Vide J BBRA S for 1925 pp. 98-100. He places Manu at the head of all smśtis, even higher than the dharmasūtra of Gautama. He cites numerous quotations from the first chap ter of the Manusmrti to the last. He looks upon all parts of the extant Manusmrti as equally authoritative and regards the Manuemṛti as the highest authority on matters of dhar</p>

<p>ma. The Mrechakatika (9. 39 )330 refers to the ordinance of Manu that a Brāhmana sinner was not to be sentenced to death, but was to be banished. An inscription of the Valabhi king Dharasena dated in the year 252 of the Valabhi era (i. e. 571 A. D. ) speaks of a king as one who obeyed340 the rules composed by Mauu (I. A. vol. 8 p. 303, Gupta Inscriptions p. 165 ). Vide also I. A. vol. IV. p. 105 where the same words occur in an inscription from Valabhi dated 216 of the Valabhi era (i. e. 535 A. D.). Sabarasvāmin, the bhāsyakāra of Jaimi. ni&rsquo;s sutras, who cannot be placed later than 500 A. D. and may be a few centuries earlier still, says “Manu and others have given instruction &quot; 341 and quotes a verse as a smrti passage which is practically the same as Manu VIII. 416 and similar to Udyoga-parva34a 33. 64. Aparārka and Kullūka point out how the Bhaviṣyapurāna expounds passages of the Manusmrti (vide Kullūka on Manu XI. 72, 73, 100 and Aparārka pp. 1071, 1076).343 It will be shown below that Brhaspati must have composed his work before 500 A. D. Brhaspati says that the Manusmrti occupies a pre-eminent position because it correc tly represents the sense of the Veda and that a smrti which is in conflict with Manu is not esteemed.344 Brhaspati in nume</p>

<p>rous places pointedly refers to the present text of the Manu smrti. One such quotation about niyoga has been cited above (note 187 ). Bṛhaspati says &ldquo;Manu has spoken of quantities (units of weights ) beginning from the mote in the sun-beam to the kārśīpana&rdquo; 345 This is obviously a reference to Manu 8. 132–136. Brhaspati says &ldquo;Mauu enumerated thirteen sons and, just as in the absence of clarified butter, oil is a substitute, so in the absence of an aurasa son or a putrikiī, the eleven kinds of sons are a substitute &ldquo;. 340 This has in view Manu IX 158-160, 180, 127-130, where Manu speaks of the twelve sons, out of whom eleven are substitutes and advocates that a sopless man should appoint a daughter (putrikā, who then is the 13th kind of son ). In another pilace Brhaspati347 decla res “Manu forbade gambling as it destroys truth, purity and wealth ; but others allowed it, provided a share was given to the king (in the gains of gambling ).” This very aptly describes the attitude of Manu (IX. 224) and of Yāj. (II. 201 203). Bphaspati says &quot; If a man kills a cow with a weapon &amp;c., he should perform the penance laid down by Manu, but if he kills a cow by forcible restraint, then he should perform the penance laid down by Angiras or Apastamba.” The reference is to Manu XI. 108-115, Āpastamba Dh. S. I. 9. 26. 1 and Angirasa verse 27 (Jivananda, part I. p. 556 ).</p>
<p>In one place Bșhaspati seems to criticise Manu (IX. 219) when Mhe says: &rsquo;those who declared clothes and other things to be impartible have not considered the position that the wealth of the rich may consist of clothes and ornaments &ldquo;.848 In</p>

<p>another place Brhagpati says “Burgu spoke of sale without ownership after deposit; listen to it attentively, I shall speak of it with more details&rdquo;.340_This keeps in view Manu VIII. 4 and clearly shows that Brhaspati was well aware of Bhrgu&rsquo;s connection with the extant Mapusmrti. Angiras as quoted in the Smṛticandrikā (I. p. 7) speaks of the dharmaśāstra of Manu. In the Vajrasāci of Asvaghosa (ed. by Weber ) several verges are quoted as from the Mānavadharma&rsquo; which occur in the extant Manusmrti,850 though it must be admitted that there are others that do not occur. In the Rāmāyana also there are verses cited as from Manu which occur in the extant Manusmrti; vide Kiskindha 18. 30-32 ( Gujarati Press, 1915 1920), where two verses are quoted as &lsquo;sung by Manu&rsquo; which correspond to Manusmrti VIII. 318 and 316 respectively.</p>
<p>The foregoing discussion of the external evidence shows that writers from the 2nd century onwards (if not earlier ) looked upon the extant Manusmrti as the most authoritative smrti. This position it could not have attained unless several centuries intervened between it and these writers. Therefore it must be presumed that the Manusmrti had attained its present form at least before the 2nd century A. D. Even the Mahābhāṣya contains a verse which is Manu II.</p>

<p>120.861 But as the verse occurs also in the Anuśāsana (104. 64-65 ) no chronological conclusion can be drawn therefrom. The Pratimānātaka (after V. S.) speaks of Manaviyadharma bāstra&rsquo; and Pracetasa-srāddhakalpa&rsquo; but as it is in con troversy whether that work can be ascribed to the ancient Bhāsa this reference will serve no useful purpose.</p>
<p>The next question is whether the Manusmrti contains earlier and later strata. There can be no doubt on this point. On numerous points the Manusmrti contains conflicting doctrines. In Manu III. 12-13 a Brāhmana is allowed to have a sūdra woman as wife, while in III. 14-19 it is emphati cally asserted that a sūdra woman cannot be the wife of a brāhmana and heavy disabilities are prescribed for him who breaks the injunction. In III. 23-26 there are contradictory statements about the appropriate forms of marriage for the several castes. In one breath Manu seems to permit niyoga (&lsquo;9. 59-63 ) and immediately afterwards he strongly reproba tes it (9. 64-69). The lengthy discussion on flesh-eating in Manu V. 27&ndash;56 discloses different mentalities. At several places the work seems even to recommend flesh-eating in sacri fices, śrviddhas and madhuparku (V. 31-32, 35, 39, 41 ), while elsewhere it recommends total abstinence from meat on all occasions whatever ( V. 48-50). In one sloka ( Manu II. 145) the father is said to be equal to a hundred ācāryas, while in the next verse the ācārya is said to be superior to the father. In V. 1 Bhrgu is said to have sprung from fire, while in I. 35 he is said to be one of the ten sons of Manu Svāyambhuva. Vide also IX. 32-56.</p>
<p>Bühler devotes considerable space to this question (S. B. E. vol. 25. pp. LXVI-LXXIII). He arrives at the conclusion that the cosmological and philosophical portions in the first and 12th books, the philosophical disquisition in II. 89-100, the classifications of pitarah in III. 193-201, the means of sub sistence for Brābmana in IV. 1-24, verses 1-4 of the fifth book. the rule about mixed castes (X. 1-7 ) and the duties of castes that are repeated in X. 101-131 were put in when the work was versified from the Mānavadharmasutra.

<p>one may not agree with all the details of Bühler&rsquo;s examina tion and with his theory about the versification of the Mānava. dharmasūtra, it may be admitted that most of the passages pointed out by him have rather the flavour of comparative modernity about them. My own position is that the original Manusmrti in verse had certain additions made in order to bring it in a line with the change in the general attitude of people on several points such as those of flesh-eating, niyoga &amp;c. But all these additions must have been made long before the 3rd century A. D. as the quotations from Brhaspati and others show.</p>
<p>In this connection it is pertinent to note that the text of the Manusmrti has been the saine with very few exceptions at least from the 6th century onwards (as the quotations in the Tantravārtika and in the Sārikara bhāsya on the Vedāntasūtra and as the commentaries of Medhātithi and others show ), while the text of the Mahābhārata differs greatly in the diffe rent editions published in our country.</p>
<p>To cite a few examples; Saṅkarācārya on V. S. I. 2. 19 quotes the latter half of Manu I. 5, on V. S. I. 3. 28 refers to Manu I. 21 in slightly different words, on V. S. IV. 2. 6 quotes Manu I. 28 (anvyo&rsquo; &amp;c.), on V. S. I. 3. 36 refers to Manu X. 4 ( about Sūdra) and quotes the first half of Manu X. 126; on V. S. II. 1. I quotes the whole of Manu XII. 91 and on V. S. II. 1. 11 he quotes Manu XII. 105-6. From this it is clear that he had before him the extant Manusmrti (from its first to the last chapter ) and treated it as an authoritative Smṛti. Similarly, Kumārila ( who, according to the present author, wrote his Tantravārtika between 650-700 A. D. (as shown on pp. 1191, 1198 and notes 1946 and 1952 of H. of Dh. Vol. V.) quotes many verses of Manu ( sometimes as Mānavam ).</p>
<p>The Tantravārtika stands in a special relation to the Manusmrti. Whenever the author speaks of Smṛtis, that of Manu is the first to come to his mind and Kumārila refers to him even before the Gautamadharmasūtra. A few examples may be cited. After finishing the discourse on the importance of Veda (consisting of Vidhis, Arthavādas, Mantras and nāmadheyas ), Kumārila starts his discourse on the Stortis and mentions Manu as the representative of or foremost maong Smrtis. On p. 105 he quotes Manu II. 6-7, though he emphy</p>

<p>the plural.smartṛbhiḥ&rsquo;i. e. smrtikāraiḥ). On the question of the duration of the stage of student-hood ( brahmacarya) for various periods, he first quotes Manu (III. 2) and then Gau tama Dh. S. II. 51-52 (on p. 192). The Tantravārtika states that authors of Smṛtis are generally prepared to accept as authoritative the usages of countries, castes and families, that are not opposed to the Vedas and first quotes Manu II. 6 and then Gaut. Dh. S. XI. 20.</p>
<p>Another problem is whether the Manusmrti has under gone several recasts. This does not seem likely and the evi. dence adduced in support of the theory that the Mauusmrti suffered several recasts is quite inadequate for the purpose. The occurrence of several conflicting passages can as well be explained on the theory of a single recast and it has also to be borne in mind, as Bühler points out, that Sanskrit writers down to the most recent times are in the habit of placing side by side conflicting opinions without actually preferring a particular view to others. The tradition of the Naradasmrti that the sāstra of Manu was successively abridged by Nārada, Mārkandeya and Sumati Bhāryava is, as has been observed above, not worth much, since it is merely intended to glorify Nārada&rsquo;s work. The other traditions given above either ignore Nārada altogether or assign him a secondary position. The present Manusmṛti is put into the mouth of Bhṛgu. Nārada&rsquo;s smṛti is clearly based upon Manu, though the former diverges from the latter on many points. Bșhaspati generally takes Manu as his text and amplifies the dicta of the Manusmrti (as the verses quoted above in notes 345-348 show ) and so his work may by analogy be regarded as a Vārtika on Manu, as Dr. Jolly puts it. Angiras also looks upon Manusmrti as most authoritative. It is therefore that the Paurānic account ( note 321 above ) regards Bhrgu and other works as the redactions of the original Manusmṣti. The quotations cited from Vṛddha-Manu and Brhan-Manu do not establish that the original Manusmrti underwent many recasts. Quotations cited under these names are later than the Manusmrti. Viśvarūpa (on Yāj. I. 69 ) quotes the views of Vṛddha-Manu on niyoga, who allows it only to sūdral. The Mitākṣarī quotes a verse from Vrddha-Manu about the widow of a sonless man being entitled to all her husband&rsquo;</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>334</p>
<p>wealth while Manu is silent on that point.369 The Mit. on Yaj. II. 135-136 and Madhava (in Parāsuramadhaviya ) quote a verse and a half from Brhan-Manu, which are expansions of Manu (V. 60 ).353 The fact that many quotations ascribed to Manu in several works are not found in the extant Manu smrti is explicable in several ways and not only by the theory of several recasts. For one thing the authors quoting from memory may be found tripping. For example, in an inscrip tion of the Badami Cālukyas of the 7th century two verses that occur in most grants of lands are ascribed to Manu, but are not found in the extant Manusmști.354 No one can for a moment doubt that the extant Manusmrti was an authorita tive work in the 7th century. Therefore, there is hardly any reliable evidence to support the theory that the Mauusmrti suffered several recasts.</p>
<p>Turning now to the internal evidence, the extant Manu smrti seems to be much older than Yājñavalkya, since the rules of judicial procedure are incomplete and awkward in Manu as compared with Yāj., since there is no reference to documents as evidence in Manu, as ordeals are not treated of in Manu, as legal definitions are almost absent in Manu, while frequent in Yāj. and as Manu is silent about the widow&rsquo;s rights, while Yāj. gives her the first place among the heirs of a sonless man. So the Manusmṛti will have to be placed some centuries earlier than the third century A. D., the latest date to which the Yājṅavalkya smști can be assigned with any show of reason. In X. 44 Manu mentions the Yavanas, Kāmbojas, Sakas, Pahlavas and Cinag365 and in X. 48 Medas</p>

<p>and Andhras. This shows that the extant Manusmrti could not be much earlier than the 3rd century B. C. The Yona, Kamboja and Gāndhāra people are mentioned in the 5th rock edict of Asoka. Manu forbids Brāhmaṇas to dwell in the kingdom of a śūdra ( IV. 61 ) and condemns the appointment of a sūdra as a judge ( VIII. 20-21 ). The late Mr. Jayaswal in his work &lsquo;Manu and Yājñavalkya&rsquo; p. 32 refers to Manu smrti XII. 100350 (among other matters) which states &lsquo;a person who knows the science of the Veda deserves the post of the commander-in-chief, the kingdom itself, the leadership in Government and the overlordship of all the world&rsquo;. He thinks that this is a sample of the aggressive brāhmana spirit that aroge when Pusyamitra Sunga became king. Pușyamitra was a Sevāpati before he became king. Mr. Jayaswal cites other examples of this spirit (such as Manu VIII. 20 which states that even a brāhmana in name only who maintains himself out of the superiority of his caste may be a judge but a sūdra never.&rsquo; This was nothing new. Centuries before the extant Manusmrti, the Tai. S. ( I. 7.3. 1 ) states that Brābmanas are gods that are directly seen. Gaut. VIII. 1 placed the learned brāhmana on the same level as the king. The extant Manu smrti in its arrangement and doctrines is much in advance of the ancient dharmasūtras such as those of Gautama, Baudhā yana and Apastamba. Taking all these things into considera tion Bühler ( S B E vol. 25 p. CXVII ) was certainly right in saying that the extant Manusmrti was composed between the second century B. C and 2nd century A. D. But the question of the date when the original Manusmrti to which additions were made between the 2nd century B. C. and 2nd century A. D. was composed presents very great difficulties. That question is largely bound up with the relation of the Maha bhārata to the Manusmrti.</p>
<p>This question is an extremely intricate one. The late V. N. Mandlik ( Intro. to the Vyavabāramayukha XLVII ) held that the Manusmrti borrowed from the Mahābhārata. Bühler after an elaborate examination of the question (SBE vol. 25, pp. LXXIV-XCVIII) came to the conclusion that it was indisputable that the 12th and 13th parvans of the Mahā, bhārata knew a Mānavadharmaśāstra which was closely.</p>

<p>connected with but not identical with the present Manusmrti. Bühler expresses himself very cautiously and it seems to me that the great scholar was unduly prepossessed in favour of the Mahābhārata as against the Manusmrti. Bühler some what contradicts himself when he says that the author of the epic only knew the dharmasūtras (SBE vol. 25, p. XCVIII). Hopkins ( Great Epic of India p. 21-22 ) seems inclined to hold that the 13th book which alone, according to him, reco gnises the sāstra declared by Manu, knew the present Manu smrti, though the earlier books cannot be held to have known a sāstra of Manu even when they employ such expressions as “Manu said.&rdquo; He thinks that there was a floating mass of verses containing philosophical and other lore attributed to the mythical Manu on which the earlier books of the Mahābhārata and the Manusmrti both drew and that the matter that is common to both works was not borrowed from any systematic treatise. Bühler accepts this view with the slight modification that the floating mass of verses was not all attributed to Manu ( S B E vol. 25 p. XC). Before giving my individual views on this vexed question as against the array of such eminent scholars as Bühler and Hopkins some facts must be clearly set forth. The Mahābhārata is nowhere men tioned by name in the Manusmrti, though the word &ldquo;itihāsa&rdquo; (in the plural ) occurs in Manu (III. 232 ). The Manusmrti mentions many historical and legendary personages, about most of whom the Mahābhārata contains similar stories. The following are the persons so mentioned in the Manus Angirasa (in II. 151–152, addressing his elders as &lsquo;putrakāḥ&rsquo;); Agastya (V. 22, in connection with sacrificing animals); Vena, Nahusa, Sudās Paijavana and Nimi (all in VII. 41 ); coming to grief through insolence ); Pșthu, Manu, Kubera and the son of Gādhi (VII. 42), benefiting by their good conduct ); Vasistha (in VIII. 110, taking an oath before king Paijavana ), Vatsa (in VIII. 116, undergoing fire ordeal ); Akṣamālā and Sārangi (in IX. 23, though of low birth, respectively were united to Vasistha and Mandapāla ); Daksa (in IX. 128-129 ) gave his daughters to Dharma, Kāśyapa and Soma ); Ajigarta (in X, 105, who was ready to sacrifice his own son ); Vāmadeva (in X, 106, desired dog&rsquo;s flesh to save his life ); Bharadvāja (in X. 107, who accepted the gift of mans cows ); Viśvāmitra (in X. 108, who took from a Candāla&rsquo;s hand a dog&rsquo;s tes Pșthu is also mentioned (in IX. 44 ) as the husband of the earth and in IX. 314 Brāhmanas are credited with HD rips</p>

<p>made fire all-devourer, the ocean undrinkable and the waning (phthisical) moon to wax. Most of the names mentioned here go far back into Vedic antiquities. For example, Vasistha&rsquo;s oath occurs in Rgveda (VII. 104. 15367) and the Bșhaddevatā (VI. 32-34 ), Ajigarta figures in the Aitareya brāhmana (VII. 16 ) and Angirasa&rsquo;s story occurs in the Tandyamaha brāhmana ( 13. 3. 24 ). Besides, the Manusmrti does not say that the stories are taken from the great epic. The Mahā bhārata also was not the first to originate these stories but is only a storehouse and encyclopaedia of the numerous popular traditions that were current in ancient India. When our Manu ( 9. 227 ) says that gambling was seen to have produced in former ages deep-rooted enmities, it is unnecessary to suppose that there is a reference to the Mahābhārata, for, from Vedic times the evil effects of gambling were known ( vide Rgveda X. 34 ) and even the Mahābhārata contains the same verse ( Udyoga 37. 19), though this fact was not noticed by Bühler. On the other hand, there are numerous passages in the Mahabharata scattered over almost all the poorvans, where occur such expressions as, &rsquo; Manur.abravid, &rsquo;the rājadharmas of Manu&rsquo;, &rsquo;the śāstra of Manu&rsquo; etc. Some of these passages agree with the extant Manusmrti, while some do not. Besides, there are hundreds of verses in the Mahabharata that are identical with the verses of the Manusmrti, though they are not expressly attributed to Manu. Dr. Bühler says that in the Vana, Sānti and Anusasana parviens alone he could identify either wholly or partly 260 verses with those of our Manu. What then is the conclusion ? Prima facie it should be, on account of all these abovementioned facts, against the Mahā bhārata and in favour of the Manusmrti being the earlier of the two. Hopkins at all events holds that the Avuśāsana parva knew a Manusmrti essentially the same as we have now. Bühler expresses himself more cautiously and says that the Santi and Anusāsana parvane knew a Mānava-dharmaśāstra closely connected with the extant one, though not identical. Both are agreed that the earlier books when they speak of Menu are either referring to the Mānava-dharmasūtra or 16 the flouting mass of popular verses, but not to our Manu.</p>

<p>___ We must now closely examine the data. The Anusāsana parva distinctly speaks of &lsquo;a śāstra declared by Manu&rsquo;.358 In the Sāntiparva are quoted two ślokas sung by Manu in his own dharmas,&rsquo; one of which is identical with Manu369 (9. 321 ). In another place the Sāntiparva speaks of the &lsquo;rājadharmas of Pracetasa Manu &lsquo;and quotes two verses therefrom.360 In the Dronaparva (7.1) Mānari arthavidyā&rsquo; is referred to and in Vanaparva the rājadharmas as proclaimed by Manu are referred to ( Vanaparva 35. 2. 21 ). In other places, the words Manu Svāyambhuva said&rsquo; occur (e. g. Santi 21. 12, Anushsana 114. 12, Vanaparva 180. 34-35, Adiparva 73. 9, 110. 32-36, Udyoga 37. 1-6). In most cases the words &lsquo;Manu said’occur without the appellation</p>
<p>• Svayambhuva&rsquo; or &lsquo;Prācetasa&rsquo; (e. g. Santi 78. 31, 88. 14-16, 121. 10-12, 152. 14, 152. 30, 266.5; Anusisana 44. 18 and 23, 65. 1 and 3, 67. 19, 68. 31, 88. 4, 115.52-53 ; Vanaparva 32. 39, Udyogaparva 40. 9-10, Adiparva 41. 31, 74. 39 ). The words</p>

<p>subjects are not guarded by the king, he shares in the 4th part of whatever sins they commit. Then some say that the whole sin is the king&rsquo;s,&rsquo; while again some say he certainly shares in balf of them (the sins ); but on hearing the ordinance of Manu our view is that he shares in the 4th part of the sing. Here the author of the Anuśāsana expressly says that he puts forward his own opinion after hearing Manu&rsquo;s ordinance. There is no doubt that the Anusāsana parva clearly refers in several places to the extant Manusmrti. In Anu. 19. 88-89 reference is made to those who know Dharmaśāstras about adultery. In Anu. 45. 17-20 reference is made to the Gathās declared by Yama and set down in Dharmaśāstras and one verse · Arse gomithunam &lsquo;is nentioned there, which is the game as Manu III. 53. In Anu. 20. 14 it is said that it is the view of Prajapati that women do not deserve independence and 20. 21 is almost the same as extant Manu 9. 3. Jayaswal arrives at this conclusion ( on p. 50 ): &rsquo;the main date may be regarded to be circa 150 B. C., the final revision and the present form would have been fixed by 100-150 A. C., not later.&rsquo; He seizes upon the word &lsquo;Senāpatya&rsquo; in Manu XII. 100. The word was placed first for preserving the regularity of the Sloka metre (in which the 5th letter in each pādu is required to be short ) as the wording Rajye ca Senapatye ca&rsquo; would have the fifth letter long. Further, Manu had already stated in several places the greatness and worth of brāhmanas e. g. Manu in I. 93 says &ldquo;Brāhmana is the lord of this whole creation, because be sprang from the mouth of the Creator as stuted in Rg. X. 90. 12), as he is the senior (among the four varṇas ), as he preserves the Veda (by memorizing it) and since he propounds Dharma&rsquo;. Vide also 1. 99-101 (which</p>

<p>occur also in Santi 72. 6, 10,11 first half ), also Manu VIII. 37, IX. 317, 319, X. 3. Further, there was the tradition of the Mahābhārata war that after Bhīṣma was mortally wounded, Drona, a brāhmana teacher, was made commander-in-chief of the Kaurava army. The Drona parva expressly refers to the ceremony of abhiselca in the case of Drona as commander-in chief. Although, the Ap. Dh. S. (I. 10. 29. 7) states that a brāhmana should not take in his hand a weapon even for test ing it, that was an extreme view ; other Dharmasūtras (like Gautama VII.25, Baud. II.2.80, Vasistha III. 24 ) allowed a brāhmana to use arms in danger to life, for protecting cows and brāhmanas &amp;c. We learn from Pānini (V. 2. 71 ) that there were before his time brāhmanas as professional soldiers and he teaches that the word &ldquo;brāhmanaka&rsquo; means a country in which brāhmanas follow the profession of arms. Kautilya (in A. IX. 2. 21-24 ) refers to armies of Brāhmanas, Ksatriyas, Vaisyas and Sūdras. Therefore, Jayaswal&rsquo;s remarks on Manu XII. 100 are worthless for settling the date of the Manusmrti. Jayaswal&rsquo;s &lsquo;Manu and Yājsavalkya&rsquo; is full of information, but it is sometimes marred by specious assumptions about ancient times for which there is hardly any solid basis. It would be impossible to deal with many such matters here for want of space. One matter, however, may be briefly men tioned here. Ou p. 288 of that work he propounds the somewhat startling proposition that Manu VIII. 169 shows that professional lawyers were already in existence in the time of the Māuava Code&rsquo;. The verse is quoted below. It literally means &rsquo;three persons have to undergo trouble (in litigation ) for others viz. witnesses, sureties, kula (family members ); while four persons prosper or benefit (in litiga tion ) viz. the brābmana, the rich (i.e. the creditor who supplies money to the litigants ), the trader and the king. No word in this verse can mean a lawyer by itself. Vipra ordinarily means brāhmaṇa. Gaut. Dh. S. 13. 26, Manu VIII. 9 and Yāj. 11.3 expressly provide that when the king cannot himself look into the causes of his subjects, he may appoint as judge &amp; brāhmaṇa learned in the Dharmaśāstra, along with sabhyas. The Mit. quotes Katyayana to the effect that if a brāhmaṇa learned in the Dharmaśāstras cannot be found then &amp; Ksat. riya or Vaisya learned in Dharmaśāstras may be appointeca So the general rule was that a brāhmana was to be the presiding judge. He benefitted by litigation in the sense that he was paid his salury whatever the result of the litigation</p>
<ol start="31">
<li>The Manusmrti</li>
</ol>
<p>341</p>
<p>might be. The king benefitted by the receipt of the fines paid by the losing parties in litigations. The commentators do not say a word about a class of lawyers helping litigants for fees. Sarvajña Nārāyana and Ramacandra paraphrase &ldquo;vipra&rsquo; as prādvivāku; Kullūka und Govindarāja simply paraphrase &lsquo;vipra&rsquo; as brāhmana. Medhātithi&rsquo;s&rsquo; text as printed is not clear, yet he commented that this verse has to be connected with the preceding verse that condemns the use of force and that&rsquo;vipru&rsquo; should not be forced to accept a gift. So it is clear, that Manu and his commentators do not speak of a pro. fession of lawyers at all. Jayaswal refers to the Burmese code as giving a scale of fees (p. 288 n. 3). That may have been the law in ancient Burma and the Burmese might have grafted it on Manu, when they adopted Manu. He should have inentioned, if he wanted to place the matter on a sound footing, a Sanskrit Smrti setting out a scale of fees for law. yers. Hopkins says that the words &rsquo;the sāstra of Manu&rsquo; occur only in the Anusasana-parva and so only that parvan knew the Manusmști, while in the other parvuna we have the expression · Manu said,&rsquo; and therefore these other books did not know the Manusmrti but are only referring to floating verses attributed to the mythical Manu. This, however, is not a reasonable conclusion. The words &lsquo;shstra of Manu&rsquo; occur only once even in the Anusūsana while in about ten places in the same parvien we come across only the words &lsquo;Manu said.&rsquo; If the words · Manu said&rsquo; in the Anusagana indicate in the Anusāoana a reference to the extant Manusmrti, there is no cogent reason why the same words in other parvans should not be regarded as referring to the Manusinfti. Besides, in the Sāntiparva also we meet with the words &lsquo;Dharmar or raja. dharmas of Manu&rsquo; and in Adiparva the word &lsquo;dharma-darsane&rsquo; ( 120. 32 ). There are some important references to Prācetasa Manu in the Mahābhārata, though in the Manusmrti no text or view is ascribed to him. The Sāntiparva (in chap. 58. 1-3 ) names seven propounders of Rajadharma viz. Brhagpati, Visālāksa, Kāvya (Usanas ), Sahasrāksa, Mahendra, Prācetasa Manu, Bhāradvāja and Gauraśiras, all of whom speak highly of protection (of subjects ) as, the (one) Dharma for kings. The great epic quotes the views of Pracetasa Manu in Santi ( 57.44-45 ) that Prācetas Manu set forth two verses in his work on Rajadharmas.) A reference to Pracetasn&rsquo;s dictumn in Anusisana 46. 1-2 to the842</p>
<p>effect that what the relations of a girl receive from the bride groom&rsquo;s side is not a sale but that it is really meant as honour to the girl and as to be paid over to the girl. This is almost the same as Manu III. 54. In Vana parva 35. 21 we have the words . you have heard the Rājadharmas that were declared by Manu.&rsquo; This Manu must be Prācetasa since in Santi 58. 1-3 Prācetasa Manu is said to have been one of the expounders of Rūjaśāstra.</p>
<p>A remarkable reference to Viśālāksa as a writer on Niti (Rājanīti) is found in an inscription from Cambodia (No. 64 in &lsquo;Inscriptions of Kambuja&rsquo; edited by Dr. R. C. Majumdar ) in praise of Yasovarman, king of Kambuja, about 889 A. D. in a highly paronomastic verse.368 That is obviously a reference to some work of Manu. Hopkins further says ( Great Epic of India, p. 21 ) that all the express citations of Manu in the Anuśāsana except one agree very closely with our Manu, while in the other parruns the citations agree only up to one-third or one-half. In the first place I demur to the latter statement. The agreements of the citations in the other books are as close and almost as frequent as in the Anuśāsana, e. g. excepting Sānti 21. 12 and 57. 43-45 all citations of Manu therein, referred to above, agree closely with Manu 7. 89, 9. 225-26, 9. 17-19 and 27, 6. 33 and 81, 11. 259-60, 5. 43 and 45 and 48-49. The same is the case with the few citations of Manu in the Vanaparva. Bühler says that the Mahābhārata knew only of the dharmasūtras. But there is positively uot one express citation attributed by nane to the well-known writers of dharmasutras, such as Gautanna, Baudhāyana, Apastamba, Vasistha or Sarkha-Likbita. That the Mahabharata knew several dharmaśistras is clear from over a dozen references to dharmasastras, often in the plural (e. g. Sānti 167. 4, 298. 40, 341. 74; Anuśāsana 19. 89, 45. 17-20; Vanaparva 207. 83, 293. 35, 313. 105; Adiparva 3. 32 and 77 etc.) The only place where a sūtrakāra is cited on matters of dhurma is Anu. 19.6; but no name is mentioned. 388 382 पारदः स्थिरकल्याणो गुणाढ्यः प्राकृताप्रियः । अनीतिर्यो विशालाक्षः शरो</p>

<p>Hastisūtra, and Asvasūtra are mentioned in Sabhū 5. 20, but no Dharmasūtra or Nitisūtra occurs anywhere. On the other hand Bühler is not prepared to admit that the views expressly attributed to Manu in the Mahābhārata are taken from a treatise and refers them to a floating mass of verses the authorship of which was unknown and was fathered upon the mythical Mapu. Distrust of ancient Indian authors could gono further. A volume would have to be written to expose the mis takes, underlying the assumptions and fallacies in the writings of Hopkins, Bühler and soine other Western scholars. The former collects two groups of passages from the Manusmrti; group A containing 9 passages, 8 of which he admits to be ancient and holds Manu VI. 54 ( uhout Yatipātras including &lsquo;alābu&rsquo;) to be doubtful and group B with 13 passages ( 3 he holds ancient, 5 doubtful and 5 others suspicious ). It is impossible to agree with Hopkins in many cases which he treats as doubtful. For example, he cites Manu VIII. 59 as contradictiny VIII. 139 and therefore be suspects that VIII. 139 is not genuine Manu. It has been shown above that Manu makes contradictory statements on some matters such es the practice of niyoga and the validity of the marriage of &amp; brāhmana with a sūdra woman. Besides, the apparent con tradiction is easily resolved, if we hold that VIII. 59 lays down a general rule for fines and VIII. 139 contains grecial rules about debts only viz. if the defendant admits in court his indebtedness but has not paid the debt, then the fine for him is five panas for each hundred of debt, but if he denies the debt he should be fined ten panas for each hundred of debt (proved ). Besides, Hopkins has inisunderstood words like Manur-abravit or-āla. Those words have not a single meaning, but are capable of several explanations; firstly, a quotation may be meant; secondly, ouly the gist of Manu&rsquo;s words ( but not his exact words ) may be intended; thirdly, the quotation may be only what the writer remembers of the original text of Manu and fourthly, he may think that what he states is the proper rule and enhances its authority by escribing it to Manu. Bühler&rsquo;s assumptions are, to say the</p>

<p>least, gratuitous and are prompted by his unwillingness to assign an early date to a versified smrti of Manu. Not only are there identical verses in Manu and the Mahābhārata, but some verses of the latter (e. g. Udyoga 35. 31 and Sānti 111. 66 ) occur in the Nāradasmrti (pp. 103 and 26 respecti vely ). In my humble opinion the following seems to be the relation of the Mahābhārata and the Manusmrti. I must state frankly that it is a mere theory, a conjecture which may be taken for what it is worth. Long before the 4th century B. C., there was a work on Dharmaśāstra composed by or attributed to Svāyambhuva Manu. This work was most probably in verse. There was also another work on Raja dharma attributed to Prācetasa Manu, which also was prior to the 4th century B. C. It is not unlikely that instead of there being two works there was one comprehensive work embody ing rules on dharma as well as on politics. There is one circumstance that points in this direction. The Mahābhārata quotes a saying (vacana ) of Pracetasa which is almost the same as our Manu 364 ( 3. 54 ). It is to these ( works or work) that Yāska, Gautama, Baudhāyana, and Kautilya refer whenever they cite the opinions of Manu or the Mānavas. The Mahābhārata also (particularly in the earlier portions ) probably refers to the same. This work was the original kernel of the present Manusmrti. Then between 2nd century</p>
<p>B. C. and 2nd century A. D. the Manusmrti was finally recast probably by Bhrgu That work must have compressed the older works in some cases and expanded it in others. This</p>

<p>hypothesis would explain why some of the verses and views quoted as Manu&rsquo;s occur in the extant Manusmrti and why some do not.365 In my opinion the extant Mahābhārata is later than the extant Manusmrti. When Nārada mentions the tradition that Sumati Bhārgava coinpressed the vest work of Manu into 4000 verses, he is somewhat obscurely hinting at the truth. The extant Manusmrti contains only about 2700 verses. Narada probably arrives at the larger figure by including the verses attributed to Vṭddha-Manu and Brhan-Manu. If Vrddha-Manu was a separate work it must have been composed before at least the 7th century A. D. at the latest. Viśvarūpa on Yāj. I. 69 (p. 75, Trivandrum ed. of 1922 ) quotes two verses on niyoga. The Mit. on Yāj. II. 270 (first half) and 272, III, 5, 20 (latter half), 260 quotes a few verses of Vrddha-Manu, while Apararka quotes him twenty times and on p. 908 quotes Manu II. 67 and immediately afterwards quotes a verse of Vșddha-Manu. Kalpataru on Vya. quotes Vrddha-Manu eight times, but in one case (on p. 402) one half of the verse is the same as Manu VIII. 157 (first hall). The Smșticandrikā quotes Vrddha-Manu verses 23 times on ācāra, 6 times on Vyavahāra and 12 times on Srāddha.</p>
<p>Brhan-Manu is cited by the Mitāksarā only a few times i.e. on YĀj. II.135-36 (11 verses on limits of sapinda and tamānodaka relationship ), on YĀj. III. 20 (latter half) two verses on āśauca. Aparārka cites Brhau-Manu only once (on p. 910 ) on Asauca. The influence of the Manusmrti spread even beyond the confines of India. In A. Bergaigne&rsquo;s Inscriptions Sanscrites de Campā et du Cambodge&rsquo; (p. 423 ) we have an inscription in which occur verses, 366 one of which is identical</p>

Jonker ( Leyden 1885) wrote a dissertation on an old Javanese law book compared with Indian sources of law like the Manusmrti ( which is still used as a law book in the island of Bali).</p>

<p>Manu had numerous commentators. As to Medhātithi Govindarāja and Kullūka, vide below sections 63, 76, 88. (1st ed.). Besides these, Nārāyana, Raghavānanda, Nandana and Rāmacandra also wrote commentaries on Manu. Mr. Mandlik published all these commentaries. Dr. Jolly publish ed ( in 1885 for the Bengal Asiatic Society ) extracts from all these commentaries (except Kullūka&rsquo;s and Ramacandra&rsquo;s ) and from an anonymous Kashmirian commentary on the first three chapters. Asahāya seems to have written a commentary on Manu (vide below section on him). The Vivādaratnākara quotes a commentary on Manu by Udayakara ( pp. 455, 560, 583, 590). The same work seems to sugyest that Bhaguri wrota a commentary on Manu.367 For the predecessors of Medha</p>

<p>tithi, vide sec. on him. Kulltika on Manu 8. 184 tells us that Bhojadeva. arranged the four verses of Manu 8. 181-184 in a particular manner and therefore suggests that Bhojadeva probably commented on Mapu. He also names a commen tator Dharanidhara on Mamu 2.83 and says that he was later than Medhātithi. He is also referred to elsewhere by Kullūka ( on Manu 4.50 ).</p>
<p>The commentator Nārāyana is certainly earlier than 1550 A. D. as his commentary is cited by Bhattoji in his commen tary on the Caturvimsutimata (vide p. 61 of the Benares Sans krit Series edition, 1907). A ins. of Narayana&rsquo;s commentary was written in 1497 A. D. and he appears to have been quoted by Riyamukuta in 1431 A.D. (Jolly in R. und. S. p. 31 ). He cites the explanation of Govindaraja on Manu VIII. 123. He appears to have composed a work called Kamadhenudipikā in which he dealt exhaustively with the prāyascittas for various sins (as said on Mauu XI. 71 ) and on the topic of flesh-eating at some length (as stated on Manu V. 56 ).

<p>prāyaścittas for Mahāpātakas (as stated on Manu XI. 209). He also refers to a Mālākāra (probably the author of a lexi con ) on Manu V. 81. He does not comment on some verses such 48 on Manu III. 174 and 278 (Mandlik&rsquo;s ed.). He is generally brief in his comments but he has longer notes than Medhātithi or Kullūka on Manu V. 16, 31, 56, VI. 34-35, 67, X. 42, XI. 130. He is later than Govindarāja and Aouri shed betweon 1100 and 1300 A. D. Raghavananda men tions by name Medhātithi, Govindarāja, Nārāyana, and Kullūka and so is later than about 1400 A. D. When Nandana flourished it is difficult to say. But he is a late writer. There are several other commentators mentioned in the catalogues of mss. who may be passed over for want of space.</p>
<p>The Tantravārtika (p. 159) after dealing with the use fulness of the Veda ( which is constituted by Vidhi, Arthavāda, Mantra and Nāmadheya ) for understanding what Dharma is, comes to the consideration of Smrtis such as those of Manu and others that have human authors. It further quotes the words Vedoskhilo Dharmamūlam&rsquo; (Manu 2. 6 and 7 ) and concludes from the words of these passages that the Smartṛs (i. e. Smrtikāras ) have bound themselves by stating that Veda is the source of Dharma. The Tantra vārtika further says that the Smrtikāras ( v. 205 ) accept th.</p>
<p>ess of usages that are not opposed to the Ved. in such passages as are quoted above. Similarly, Mānavam (i.e. Manusmrti) states in 12. 105, 106 that one who desires to find out the pure Dharma has to rely upon Prutyakṣu and Anu māna, and that man really knows Veda who makes use of logic in interpreting Veda. The Tantravārtika (p. 191 ) further quotes a passage as of Manu which does not occur in the present Manu but occurs in the MBH, Santiparva 140.38, which states that a man should first extricate himself from distress by any action, soft or hard, and then when he becomes able, should practise what Dharma requires. Similarly, Sabara on P. M. S. VI. 1. 12 quotes a verge as Smrti which is almost the same as the extant Manu (8. 416 ) and which is also similar to Udyogapurva, ch. 33.64. For further referepet to Manu, vide the present author&rsquo;s paper in JBBRAS NEW Series, 1925 ) Vol. I pp. 98-102.

<p>different from the extant Manu. For example, on p. 191 he quotes &amp; verse as Manu&rsquo;s which does not occur in the extant Smrti.</p>
<p>The above discussion shows that the extant Manusmrti was practically the same long before the 7th century A. D.</p>
<p>It may be noted that Sabaragvāmin on PMS. VI. 1. 12 quotes a verse as Smṛti which is practically the same as extant Manu VIII. 116. Sabara has to be placed between 200 and 400 A. D. (nearer the former date); vide H. of Dh. Vol. V. p. 1197. Hence the extant Manusmrti cannot be placed later than 2nd century A. D. Vide the present author&rsquo;s paper on &lsquo;Gleanings from Sabara and the Tantravārtika&rsquo; in JBBRAS (old series ) Vol. 26 ( 1924 ) pp. 83-98.</p>
<p>Viśvarūpa ( on Yrij. I. 69 ), the Mitākṣarā, the Smṛtica ndrikā, the Parāśarainadhaviya and other works quote dozens of verses from Vrddha&ndash;Manu on ūhnika, vyavahāra and prāyuscittu. The Mitūksarā (on Yāj. II. 135-6, III. 20 ), Aparārka p. 910 and other works cite a few verses from Brhan Manu. No independent works going under these names have yet been unearthed. Those works, if they ever existed independently, appear to have been later than our Manu. For example, our Manu is silent about the widow&rsquo;s right to inherit to her husband, but Vṛddha-Manu recognises the right of a chaste widow to take the entire wealth of her husband (Mit. on Yāj. II. 136); similarly, Bșhan-Manu ( according to the Mit. ) seems to refer to Manu&rsquo;s view about the meaning of &lsquo;gamānodaka&rsquo; (Manu 5. 60 ) and modifies it. It is not unlikely that those verses which were not recognised 28 Manu&rsquo;s by ancient commentators like Medhātithi and were yet found in the msg. of the Manusmrti were regarded as Vrddha-or Bphan-Manu.</p>
