06 The Baudhāyana Dharmasūtra


This has been edited several times (text by Dr. Hultzsch at Leipzig in 1884, text in the Ānandāśrama collection of smṛtis and in the Mysore Government Oriental Series in 1907 with the commentary of Govindasvāmin; translated in S. B. E., Vol. 14, with an Introduction). The Mysore edition has been used in this work. Baudhāyana is a teacher of the Kṛṣṇayajurveda. A complete set of the Baudhāyanasūtras has not yet been recovered and has not been as carefully preserved as the sūtras of Āpastamba and Hiraṇyakeśin. Dr. Burnell arranges Baudhāyana's sūtras into six sūtras, the Śrautasūtra in 19 praśnas (probably); Karmāntasūtra in 20 adhyāyas; Dvaidhasūtra in four praśnas; Gṛhyasūtra in four praśnas; Dharmasūtra in four praśnas; Śulvasūtra in three adhyāyas. The commentators offer no indication as to the place originally assigned to the _gṛhya_, _dharma_ and _śulva_ _sūtras_ in the whole collection. Dr. Caland in his mono graph (A.D. 1903) 'Uber das Rituelle sūtra des Baudhayana' gives on p. 12 the contents of the Baudhāyanasūtra as follow: Praśnas I-XXI Śrauta, XXII-XXV Dvaidha, XXVI XVIII Karmānta; XXIX-XXXI Prāyaścitta; XXXII Śulvasūtra; XXXIII-XXXV Gṛhyasūtra, XXXVI Gṛhyaprāyaścitta ; XXXVII Gṛhyaparibhāsā; XXXVIII-XLI Gṛhyapariśiṣṭa; XLII-XLIV Pitṛmedha; XLV Pravara; XLVI-XLIX Dharma. Dr. Caland edited nine _praśnas_ of the Śrautasūtra for the B. I. Series (A. D. 1904). Dr. R. Shamsastri published for the Mysore University (in 1920) the Baudhāyanagṛhyasūtra with _paribhāṣā_, gṛhyaśesa, Pitṛmedhasūtra. The Gṛhyasūtra cites the view of Baudhāyana himself (1.7). The Baudhāyana-dharma refers to the Gṛhya and presuppose it in several places (vide note 54). In the Baudhāyanagṛhya (III. 9. 6) we have a reference to _padakāra_ Ātreya, Vṛttikāra Kauṇḍinya, Pravacanakāra Kaṇva Bodhāyana, and Sūtrakāra Āpastamba.[^68c] A similar passsage occurs in the Bhāradvāja Gṛhyasūtra. In the Baudhāyana-dharma-sūtra (II. 5.27 Ṛṣitarpaṇa) we have Kaṇva Bodhāyana, Āpastamba sūtrakāra and Satyāṣādha Hiraṇyakesin one after another. These references show that Kaṇva Bodhāyana was an ancient sage when the Baudhāyana-dharmasūtra was written and that he could not have been the author of the gṛhya or the dharmasūtras of Baudhāyana. Baudhāyana may have been a descendant of this Kaṇva Bodhāyana. This surmise is supported by Govindasvāmin who explains Baudhāyana occurring in Baudhāyanadharinasūtra 1. 3. 13 as Kāṇvāyana. In the dharmasūtra Baudhāyana is himself cited as an authority several times (e.g. I. 4. 15 and 24, III. 5. 8, III. 6. 20). In all these places the Mysore edition reads Bodhāyana, while the Ānandāśrama reads Baudhāyana. In one or two places he is styled 'bhagavān (III. 6. 20). Several explanations are offered by the commentator Govindasvāmin (on I. 3. 13). He says that it is the practice of the Ācāryas to refer to themselves in the third person (as Medhātithi says on Manu. [^69]) or that the author of the dharmasūtra is a pupil of Baudhāyana as the Manusmṛti is promulgated by Bhṛgu, the pupil of Manu, or there was some other Baudhāyana whose works have not come down to us.

Confusion results from the lists of sages in turpaṇa mention ed in several Gṛhyasūtras. The passage from Baudhāyana gp is quoted in note 68a. In that passage Kāṇva Bodhāyana is called 'pravacanakāra' and Āpastamba is called 'sūtrakāra', while Satyāsādha, Hiraṇyakeśa, Vājasaneya, Yājñavalkya, Bhara dyāja and Agniveśya are merely named without any addition, In the Baud. Dh. 8. quoted in the saine note Kaṇva Baudhāyana (without the epithet 'pravacanakóra '), Āpastamba sūtrakāra and Satyāsādha Hiraṇyakeśin are named. Two questions arise about the three names viz. (1) aro the sages mentioned in the tarpana passages the authors of the sūtra works in which they occur; ( % ) what is the import of the words pravacanakāra and sūtrakāra applied to Kāṇva Bodhāyana and Apastamba respe ctively and do those words suggest that Kāṇva Bodhāyana is much earlier than Āpastamba. The present writer thinks that the authors of the Gṛhyasūtras were different from Kaṇva Bodhā yana and Apastamba to whom water is directed to be offered in the tarpaṇa part of those works. They might be descendants of Kāṇva Bodhāyana and Apastamba who are included in the sages for turpana. 

If Kāṇva Bodhāyana and Apastamba mentioned in the tarpapa passage were also the authors of the Bodhāyana and Āpastamba gphyasūtras it is very difficult to believe that they recommended to the generations that would come after them to offer water to them in tarpana. The word pravacana 69a occurs

frequently in the Upanisads viz. Tai. Up. 9, Katha II. 23 and Mundaka III. 2.4 (nāyam-ātmā pravacanena labhyah ). The Tai. Up. (I. 9), after setting out the opinions of two sages, mentions the view of Nāka Maudgalya that svādhyāya (study of the Veda ) and pravacana ( expounding or exposition i. e. teaching ) is tapas (i. e. they should be striven for). The Rgveda I. 162-1 employs the form 'pravaksyāmaḥ (we shall loudly proclaim in the sacrifices the valorous deeds of the swift horse born among Gods ). The Ap. Gr. while dilating upon the offering of Madhuparka once a year to one's teacher, father-in-law, king &c. when they pay a visit, provides that one should offer only once and not overy year Madhuparka to a famous expounder of the Veda and its meaning ) acc. to Haradatta (on Āp. Gr. V. 13. 20. (sakrit pravaktre citraya). In these words (pravacanakāra and sūtrakāra ) there is no suggestion of time or early or late in time. The only difference is that the expounder may compose his work in any way (which may be prolix or otherwise ), but a sūtrakāra has to be brief and compose his work in an appropriate style. 

The following are the contents of the Baudhāyana-dharma sutra :- Praśna I:-Sources of dharma, who are sistas, pariṣad, different practices of northern and southern India, countries where śistas reside and where mixed castes reside, prāyaścitta for visiting countries of the latter type; 2 Studenthood for 48, 24 or 12 years, time of upanayana and the girdle, skin, staff appropriate to each caste, duties of brahmacārin, eulogy of brahmacarya;3.

are entirely in verse. The style is quite different from that of the first two praśnas. The first five chapters of the fourth praśna dealing with prāyaścittas are more or less superfluous, the same gubject having been dealt with in II. 1. and III. 4-10. Some of the sūtras in the earlier praśnas are repeated verbatim in the fourth, e. g. II, I, 33-34 and IV. 2. 10-11 (avaklıni-prāyascitta). The third praśnn also is not free from doubt. The tenth chapter of the third praśna is, as said above, taken from Gautama. The sixth chapter of the third praśna agrees very closely in phraseology with the 48th chapter of the Visnudharmasūtra. But it is rather difficult to say which is the borrower. Dr. Jolly (S. B. E. Vol. VII. p. XIX) is inclined to think that both borrowed from a common source. It seems more probable that Visnu borrows fronı Baudhiyana, as the Viṣnudharmasūtra uses the form punita' in place of 'punatha' (in Baud.) and as the Viṣnudharmasūtra omits all reference to Rudra ( Baud. III. 6. 12.) and omits the words "ganān paśyati, ganādhipatim paśyati ... bhagavān Bodhāyanaḥ" (Baud. III. 6. 20.). In the Mysore edition all the four praśngs of the Dharmısūtra are divided into adhyāyas, but the Mss used by Bühler appear to have divided the first two praśnas into kandikās and the last two into adhyāyas. There are many repetitions even in the first two praśnas, which therefore make one rather doubtful about the authenticity of the first two praśnas also in their entirety. For example II. 6. 11 and 31 have identical; parts in II, 7 22 and II. 10.53 the same verse ("astau grāsā" &c.) is quoted. Such repetitions are frequent in the two last praśnas e. g. III. 2. 16 and III, 3.23 ; III. 4. 5 and III.7. 12. Some of tho quotations ascribed to Baudhāyana in the Mitāksarā and other works ara not taken from the tharmasīlra, but from the Gṛhyasūtra or its supplements (e. g. the words 'ekām sākhāmadhite śrotriyah" quoted in the Mit. on Yāj. III. 24 which are cited by Hultzsch (on p. 125), are taken from the Gṛhya (vide note 78 below). 

Though the fourth praśna appears to be interpolated, yet the interpolation must have taken place early enough. Viśvarūpa on Yāj. I. 64 quotes Baud. Dh. S. IV. 1. 15-16 (trīni varṣānyr tumati ) expressly as Baudhayana's and on Yāj. I. 72 quotes Baud. Dl. S. IV. 1. 22 (bhartuh pratinivesena &c.) by name. The Mit, on Yāj. III. 305 quotes (as Baudhāyana's) a long passage, Baudh. Dh. S. IV. 1, 5-11. Saṅkarācārya on Br. Wo. IV.5. 15 quotes Baud. II. 10. % "brahmacaryavan praxmati as smṛti. Yāj. I. 71 is almost the same as Baud. Dh. 152. 58 ( Somaḥ saucam &c)

History of Dharmaśāstra 

The Dharmasūtra of Baudhāyana is somewhat loose in structure and is not concise. Govindasvāmin remarks (on I. 2. 19) that Baudhāyana does not aim at brevity.70 Several subjects are treated of in two places and often without any logical connection with what precedes or follows. Rules of inheritance (dāya-bhāga ) occur in the midst of rules about prāgascitta (in II. 2.); rules about holidays (anadhyāya) occur immediately after the eight forms of marriage and the condemnation of the sale of a daugher (I. 11). Rules about snutaka occur in two places (1. 3 and II. 3. 10 ff.). Baudhāyana quotes at least 90 Verses introduced by the words "athāpyudāharanti," more than 80 being from the first two praśnas alone. There are over two hundred other verses, about 80 of which occur in the first two praśnas and about ten are Vedic. Some of the verses even in the first two praśnas do not appear to be quotations e. g. I. 1. 16, II. 2. 1. II. 3. 50, II. 3. 52-54 and 56. A verse quoted is in the Vamsastha metre (IV. 3. 14); there are two verses in the Upajāti metre taken as a quotation (II. 3. 18). There are some prose quota tions introduced with the words "athāpyudāharanti" (e. g. II. 4. 5 and II. 6. 30 which refers to the asura Kapila son of Prahlada ). The language of the Baud. Dh. 8. is archaic and often departs from the Pāṇinean standard. Baudhāyana employs such un Pāninean forms as “gphya" (for gļhityā in II. 5. 1), pūjya (II. 9. 5.), "adhigacchānaḥ" (in II. 9.9.), ānayitvā (III. 3. 6), "punatha " (in III, 6. 5, probably a quotation,), "tebhiḥ" (for taiḥ in III. 2. 16, a quotation). In several places Baudhāyana states opposite views and then gives his own opinion on the point, e. g. Baud. I. 5. 105-109 (about impurity on birth); II. 1. 49-51. 

As regards the literature known to Baudhāyana the following points may be noted. All the four Vedas are mentioned by name in II. 5. 27 ( tarpana ). He quotes very frequently the Taittiriya Samhitā, Tai. Brāhmana and the Tai. Āranyaka (in the Andhra recension). Well-known hymns of the Rgveda such as the Aghamarṣaṇa, the Purusasūkta and also simple .rks' are frequently referred to. In III. 10 ( which is almost the same as Gautama 19 ) there is a sūtra enumerating the Upaniṣads, the Samhitas of all the Vedas and several sūmans as purificatory texts. There are long quotations taken from the Satapatha brāhmaṇa (XI. 3. 3.1 ff and XI. 5. 6.3) in Baud. (1. 2. 52 about

brahmacūri and II. 6. 7-9 about brahmayajṅı). It is noteworthy that in the tarpana there is an invocation of the Atharyaveda and immediately afterwards of the Atharvāngirasah. The same is found in the Baudhāyanagṛhya also (III. 2.9 and 22 ). In the Upaniṣads (Brhadaranyaka II. 4. 10, 1V. 1. 2) it is the word Atharvāngirasaḥ that stands for the Atharvaveda. Baudhāyana quotes a gāthā of the Bhāllavins (I. 1. 29 ) about the geographical limits of Aryavarta. Vasistha adduces the same verso (I. 15 ) and says that it is taken froin the Nidāna work of the Bhāllavins. The Nirukta also mentions a school of Vedic interpretation called Naidānāh. It is difficult to say what Nidāna works contained. Itihūsa and Purana occur in the tarpaṇu (II. 5. 27). The angas of the Vedas occur in I. 1.8 and the six anyas in 11. 8. 2. Whether the word "rahasya” in II. 8. 3 means the Āranyakas (as Govindasvāmin explains ) is doubtful. Baudhāyana mentions a Vaikhānasa-śāstra in II. 6. 16, which appears to refer to the work of Vikhanas on hermits and speaks of Srāmayaka (the rites prescribed by Vikhanas for initiation as hermit), just as Gautama does. Among the authors on dharma mentioned by name are : Aupajanghani ( II. 2. 33 for the view that only aurasa son was to be recognised and not the other kinds of sons71), Kātya (1.2. 47), Kaśyapa (or Kāśyapa in other editions, I. 11. 20 on the point that a woman bought cannot be a patnī), Gautama (I. 1. 23 and II. 2. 70 ), Prajapati (II, 4. 15 about failure in Sandhyopāsana, and II. 10. 71 about sannyūsa), Manu (IV. 1. 14 and IV. 2. 16), Maudgalya (II. 2. 61, about observances of a widow being restricted only to six months after her husband's death), Harita (II. 1. 50). Baud. I. 2.7 quotes a verse, which Vasistha ascribes to Hārīta (Vas. II. 6). As to Gautama, vide p. 33 above. Manu is only mentioned in the fourth praśna, the authenticity of which, as said above, is very doubtful. Baudhāyana II. 2. 16 ( about the efficacy of Aglumarṣaṇa) closely agrees with Manu XI. 260. The first reference to Manu's teaching cannot be traced in the Manusmṛti. Prajāpati ( in III. 9. 21 ) seems to stand for god Brahmā and not for any real or mythical writor on dharma. One remarkable piece of information contained in Baudhāyana (II. 6. 30 ) is that he quotes from a work (of the Brāhmana class in language ) a prose passage wherein the division into four aśramas is ascribed to an asura Kapila, son of Pralhāda. In II. 2.79 Baudhāyana quotes a gūthū from the dialogue between the

daughter of Uśanas and the king Vrsaparvan, which is nearly the same as Mahābhārata I. 78. 10 and 34. Baud. quotes the view of Ācāryas (II. 6. 29 ) as Gautama does. In several places he refers to the views of his predecessors on dharma as “others" (eke, apare ) e. g. I. 4. 23, 1. 5. 16, I. 6. 105-106, II. 5. 2. In II, 3. 18 two verses in the Upajāti metre are quoted as sung by "anna" (food). From the numerous quotations in verse cited by Baudhāyana on topics of dharma, it follows that the Dharmasūtra was preceded by a considerable number of works on dharma in verse. Bühler (SBE vol. XIV, p. XLIII) says that Vijñāneśvara was the first writer who quoted the Baud. D. S. But there are writers who flourished centuries before Vijñāneśvara that regarded Baudhāyana as a writer on dharma and either quoted his words or pointedly referred to them. Sabara in his bhūsya on Jaimini I. 3. 3 says that the rule in the Smṛtis about the period of Vedic study being 48 years is opposed to the Vedic injunction "one who has begot sons and whose hair are dark should consecrate the sacrificial fires73.” This must be regarded as referring to the words of Baudhāyana (I. 2.1). Sabara uses the same word “Vedabrahmacarya" that Baud. employs. It is true that Gautama and Āpastamba both refer to the rule about 48 years, but they do not employ the word "veda-brahmacarya." The Tantravārtika7 of Kumārila says that the words of Āpastamba (II. 6. 15. 1) which seem to accept the validity of local and family usages (even though opposed to Smṛti tradition) stand refuted by the words of Baudhāyana (I. 1. 19-24 ) who cites only such censured usages as are opposed to Snirti. Kumārila appears to think that Baudhāyana attacks the extant work of Āpastamba, i. e, the present Baud. is later than the present Āpastamba. It is not necessary to follow Kumārila implicitly as regards chronological details, where he is speaking of writers that flourished over a thous and years before him. But his opinion deserves weight.

The Baulhāyana Dharmasūtra 

vārtika quotes a Smṛti passage which bears a close resemblance to Baudhāyana (II. 3. 28). In the commentary of Viśvarūpa (who as we shall see below flourished about 800 A. D.)on Yājñavalkya, Baudhāyana is quoted at least nine times in the chapter on īcūra alone. Vide Viśvarūpa on Yāj. I. 21, 26, 29,53, 64, 69, 72, 79, 195 (Trivandrum edition), where Baud. I. 5. 14, I. 2.30, , 5.5, 1. 1. 17, IV.1. 15, 1V. 1. 18, 1V. 1.22, IV. 1. 20 and I. 5. 47 are respecti vely quoted. There are very few variations from the present text and the only serious variation is as regards the last (1,5.47) which is in prose ( while Viśvarūpa quotes a verse ). It is remar kable that Visvarūpa quotes several verses from the fourth praśruri, which shows that even if the fourth praźna be an interpolation, it is comparatively an ancient one. The Mit. also (on Yāj. III. 306 ) quotes a long passage from the fourth praśna (IV.1.5-11 ). The words of the Sākuntala76 that the first precept is that a girl is to be given away to a meritorious person are probably a reminiscence of Baud. IV. 1. 12. Medhātithi on Manu. V. 117 quotes Baudhāyana I. 5. 47 and on IV. 36 quotes Baud. I. 4. 2 (which is mutilated as printed). On Manu. V, 114 he says that all the rules about purification of substances are contained in Baudhāyana-smṛti. On Manu. V. 118, he quotes Baud. I. 5. 50. 

About the home of Baudhāyana it is difficult to advance any positive conclusion. In modern times Baudhāyaniyas are mostly confined to the south. We know that Sāyana, the great commentator of the Vedas, was a Baudhāyaniya. A grant of Nandivarma, a Pallava, of the 9th century mentions Brāhmaṇas of the pravacina-sūtra as recipients.77 As Baudhāyana is called pravacanakāra in the Gṛhyasūtra Bühler thinks (8. B. E. vol. 14 p. XLII) that the Brāhmanas belonged to the Baudhāyanacarana. Bühler is probably right. In the grant most of the donees are students of the Āpastamba Sūtra. First the Gotra, then the Sūtra and then the name of the donee are introduced in the grant. Therefore as some of the donees are said to be students of "pravacanasūtra," it follows that "pravacana" stands for some sūtra school. It appears that sūtra and pravucunui are two different

things, whatever the latter term may mean. Baudhāyana is called pravacanakāra and Apastamba is styled sūtrakāra. We are toid by the Baudhāyana-gphysūtra78 that a Brāhmaṇa who studied sūtra and pravacana was styled “bhrūna." Bühler was inclined to hold that Baudhāyana was a southern teacher for several reasons. Baudhāyana mentions customs of the south and includes see-faring as a custom peculiar to the north (I. 1. 20 ), while in another place he places sea-faring at the head of sins (patanīyas ) lesser than the mortal ones (II. 1. 41 ). Therefore it is said that he was not a northern teacher. But as against this we have to remember that Baudhāyana (I. 1.29) quotes with approval a verse in which the countries of Avanti (Ujjain), Anga, Magadha, Surāstra ( Kathiawar) and Dakṣiṇāpatha are declared to be the home of mixed castes. Dakṣiṇāpatha was generally supposed to be the whole peninsula south of the Narmadā. Baudhāyana, if he was a native of the south, would not have spoken of his country as the home of mixed castes only, unless he put a restricted meaning on the word Daksiṇāpatha ( which sometimes meant in later days Mahārāstra). Vide J. B. B. R. A. S. for 1917 p. 620. Though as stated above, the question of the home of Baudhāyana is a difficult one, yet if a definite inclination has to be shown, then I am disposed to agree with Bühler that the author of Baud. Dh. 8. was a southerner. It is important to note that Baud. wants to expound the dharmas declared in the Veda, in the Smṛtis and those practised by śistas (I. 1.1-4) and defines sistas (1. 1.5-6) as those who possess certain moral qualities and who understand the Veda together with other supporting sastras. He sets out first the five peculiar usages of the southern part, two of which are the usages of marrying one's maternal uncle's or paternal aunt's daughter, These two are even now in vogue in some parts of Mahārāstra and the South among certain sub-divisions of brāhmaṇas and were not prevalent in the north. Baudhāyana impartially sets forth five practices of the south and five of the north that were opposed to ancient śāstras and his own view appears to have been that in the case of all persons belonging to Aryāvarta ( whether they be in the northern or southern parts) both sets of five practices in sūtras ( 19 and 20 ) were not to be followed. In that connection he quotes several (three) views about Aryāvarta and two verses more, one of which

names the countries in which there is mixture of castes and the 2nd mentions some countries like Āratta (Panjab), Sauvīra, Puṇdra, Vanga, Kalinga, sojourn in which made a person liable to undergo an expiation. The countries mentioned in the first verse are all (except Dakṣiṇāpatha ) to the north of the Narmadā. It is quite probable that he did not like the usage of marrying one's maternaljunole's or paternal aunt's daughter even for southern people. It should be noted that almost all the countries in the 2nd verse are north of the Narmadā. Further, Daksināpatha appears to have meant a country roughly liko modern Mahārāstra long before the Christian era; vide ASWI. Vol. V. p. 60 which shows that in an inscription (No. 1) of Nanaghat (Poona District ) Vedisiri is mentioned as king of Daksināpatha. Vide ASWI Vol. IV. p. 110 and Rudradāman's inscription (E. I. Vol. VIII at p. 44, where Satakarni is said to have been lord of Dakṣiṇāpatha). The fact that Āpastamblyas, Hiraṇyakeśins and Baudhāyaniyas have congregated much more in the suuth than in the north for centuries supports the above statement. The words Uttarā patha and Daksimāpatha were never strictly defined. For example, in the Sanjan plates ( supposed to be spurious ) of Buddhavarasa (E. I. Vol. 14 p. 144 at p. 149 about 700 A. D.) we meet with the words 'Uttarāpa thādhipati-Sri-Harṣadevaparājayopalabdhogra-pratāpah' i. e. king Harsa is said to have been lord of Uttarapatha. If we turn to the Harsacarita of Bāṇa (first paragraph after two initial verses of the 5th Ucchyāsa ) we read 'Atha kadācid-rajā Rajyavardhanam-ābūya Hūṇān hantum...cirantanairamātyaih... kṛtvā sābhisāram-uttarūpatham prāhiṇot'. This shows that Sthānvisvara (modern Thanesar) was not included in Uttarāpatha in Bāna's days. Uttarāpatha occurs in the Hathigumpha Inscription of Khāravela ( E.I. Vol. XX. p.71 at p. 79 and p. 88 ). Pānini knows the word as in V. 1.77 'Uttarāpathenāhrtam ca' ( Uttarāpathenāhrtam auttarāpathikam, Uttarāpathena gaochati auttarapathikah). About Dakṣiṇāpatha the Mahābhāsya says that large lakes are called 'Sarasi' in Dakṣiṇāpatha (Kielhorn's ed. Vol. I. p. 73). The word 'Dakṣiṇāpatha oocurs in the gana 

dhūmādi' (Pān. IV. %. 127 ). 

The extant Baudhāyanadharmasūtra is certainly later than Gautama, as it mentions Gautama twice by name and as one quota. tion at least is found in the extant Gautama. Besides Baudhāyana quotes by name several teachers on dharma, while Gautama quotes only one, Manu. Baudhāyana is far removed from the times on the Upaniṣads. Baud. (II, 7, 15) quotes a verse which is itself an 

History of Dharmaśāstra 

adaptation of a passage from the Chāndogya-upaniṣad. 79 He quotes Harīta. It is uncertain whether the Hāritadharmasūtra, a manuscript of which was discovered by the late Vaman Sastri Islāmpurkar at Nasik, is the one intended. Bühler thought that the work of Baudhāyana was earlier than that of Āpastamba by a century or two. His first reason was that Kāṇva Baudhāyana receives homage in the tarpaṇa before Āpastamba and Hiraṇyakesin and that the same order is observed in the Baudhayana-gṛhyasūtra. But this reason is far from convincing. It may be conceded that Baudhāyana was regarded as the oldest (or the most authoritative or respectable ) of the three schools of the Black Yajurveda. But from this it does not at all follow that the extant dharina-sūtra of the Baudhāyaniyas is earlier than that of the Āpastambiyas. For aught we know the sūtra compiled for the school of Baudhāyana may be later than the sūtra manual of the Āpastambiyas. We saw above that orthodox opinion, represented by Kumārila, regards Baudhāyana's work as later than Āpastamba's. All the three founders of the three schools are mentioned in the Baudhāyanagṛhya and dharmasūtra. One may equally argue with good reason that both these works knew a sūtra work of Apastamba and that the extant dharmasūtra of Āpastamba is that work. Another reason assigned for the priority of Baudhāyana's work over Apastamba's is that, though both have numerous sūtras that agree almost word for word. a comparison of the views of the two writers shows that Apastamba lays down stricter and more puritanic (and therefore later) views on certain points than Baudhāyana. Gautama, Baudhāyana and Vasistha mention several secondary sons, while Apastamba is silent about them, Gautama, Baudhāyana (II. 2. 17, 62 ), Vasistha and even Visnu approve of the practice of niyoga, while Āpastamba condemns it (II. 6, 13.1-9). Gautama and Baudhāyana (1. 11. 1) speak of eight forms of marriage, while Āpastamba speaks of only six and omits Prājāpatya and Paiśāca (II. 5. 11. 17-20 and II. 5. 12. 1-2). Baudhāyana (II.2.4-6) allowed a larger share to the eldest son on a partition, while Āpastamba condemns such a procedure (II. 6. 14. 10-14). The Baudhāyana-gṛhyasūtra (II. 4, 6) allows upanayana to rathakūra, while Āpastamba (gṛhya 4. 10. 1-4) does not do so (dharmasūtra I. 1. 1. 19). These points are hardly conclusive on the question of date. From

very ancient times there was great divergence of opinion among the doctors of the law on most, if not on all, of these points. There is no hard and fast rule that these doctrines were upheld by early writers and condeinned by later ones. Baudhāyana himself quotes the views of an ancient writer, Aupajanghani, who condemned all secondary sons. The verses that Baudhāyana quotes on this point (II. 2. 34-36 ) are quoted by Āpastamba also but without the author's name (Ap. II. 6. 13.6), there being variants only in the first verse. Niyoga was allowed by Manu (9. 56-63 ) and then condemned (9. 64-68) and Bșhaspati refers to this attitude of Manu (vide Kullūka on Manu 9. 68). Even 40 late a writer as Yājñavalkya (II. 131 ) approves of niyoga. About the rathakūra being allowed to consecrate the sacred firos there is a discussion in the sūtras of Jaimini (VI. 1. 44 ff). Vedic passages supported both methods viz. equal division among sons and the bestowal of a larger share on the eldest. Even Yājña valkya (II. 118) allows a larger share to the eldest son. Therefore, hardly anyone of the circumstances relied upon by Bühler as indicating a later age for Āpastamba is conclusive or convincing. The third ground for placing Baudhāyana before Apastamba is that the style of the former is simpler and older as compared with the latter's. That Baudhāyana is simpler than Āpastamba may be admitted. But this may be due to the fact that Baudhāyana has been tampered with more than Āpastamba. On the other hand Āpastamba contains more un-Pāṇinean forms, more uncouth constructions, more words in an archaic sense than is the case with Bandhāyana. All that is almost certain about the age of the Baudhāyana-dharmasūtra is that it is later than the work of Gautama, that its style, its doctrines and its general out-look on different subjeots do not compel us to assign it a later date than that of the other dharmasūtras. We have adduced evidence to show that long before the days of Sabara ( whose latest date cannot be later than 500 A. D.) the Baudhāyana-dharmasūtra was an authoritative smṛti; it follows that the dlarınasūtra must be placed somewhere between 500-200 B. C. Numerous sūtras are identical in Baudhāyana and Āpastamba e. g. Ap. I. 1. 2. 30 = Baud. I. 2. 40-41, Āp. I. 2. 6. 8-9 = Baud. I. 2. 39, Ap. I. 5. 15.8 = Baud. I. 2. 31, Ap. I. 11. 31. 11 and 16 = Baud. II. 3. 39 and 32. There are several verses that occur in both e. (). Baud. II. 1. 4% = Āp. I. 9. 27. 11, Baud. II. 2. 34-36 = Āp. II. 6. 13. 6 (thtag verses condemning secondary sors), Baud. II. 10. 63 Ap 11. 9. 21. 10, Baud. II. 7. 22-23 = Ap. II. 4. 9. 13. (two verdes1

Baud. II. 6. 36 = Āp. II. 9. 24. 8. Besides these there are numerous Vedic quotations that are common to both. All this, however, does not establish anything about their relative position. The Vasistha-dharmasūtra also has numerous quotations in common with Baud. Vide Vas. I. 15. = Baud. I. 1. 28, Vas. III. 5, 6, 11, 20, 56 = Baud. I. 1, 10, 12, 11, 8 and I. 5. 58. (respectively ); Vas. 6. 20-21 = Baud. II. 7. 22-23; Vas. VIII. 17 = Baud. II, 2, 1 ; Vas. XI. 27-28 = Baud. II. 8. 21-22; Vas. XVI. 34 = Baud. I. 10. 35, Vas. XVII. 73 = Baud. IV, 1. 17, Vas. XVII. 86 = Baud. I. 5. 102; Vas. XXII. 10 = Baud. I. 1. 33. It is to be noted that some of these quotations (Baud, II. 8. 21-22, I. 10. 35) occur in the extant Manusmṛti (III. 125-126 and VIII, 98). There are a few prose sūtras in Vas that are transformed into verse in Baud. and vice versa e. g. Vas. III. 41 (prose) = Baud. 1. 5. 20 (quoted as a verse ), Vas. III. 57 ( quoted as a verse ) = Baud. I. 6. 19-20. It is not likely that one borrows from the other. There are two other possible explanations, viz. that both Baud. and Vas. (and Manu also) quote froin or adapt a common source or that the three works have been tampered with and interpolations introduced at every step. The latter alternative is too sweeping as the number of verses is very large and makes all the old sūtras except that of Gautama valueless for all chronological purposes. One cannot subscribe to the view that such extensive interpolations took place as the latter theory demands. The first alternative appears more reasonable. What that common source was, whether it was a regular work in verse or whether there was a floating mass of such popular verses as Bühler holds, are questions that present Very great difficulties. It is not easy to believe that there hundreds of floating verses on dharmu no body knew by whom composed, on which writers of the centuries preceding the Christian era drew for supporting their opinions. That does not sound as a very likely procedure. It is more probable that such verses were contained in a work or works now lost. 

I tried on pp. 29-31 of the first edition to bring forward arguments on both sides of the question whether Baudhāyana Dh. S. is earlier or later than Apastamba and on p. 30 stated that the Baud. Dh. 8. may be placed between 500 B. C. and 200 B. C. Dr. Ram Gopal (p. 76 of his work) trots out the plea that I am inconsistent. I have given above an answer to this charge in the case of my remarks about Gautama. So I do not want to rebut here the charge of inconsistency. I am prepared to place Baudhāyana Dh. S. between 600 B. O, to 300 B. All these

datos are more or less tentative and there is n10 finality about them at least at present. 

In the tarpana, Baud. (II. 5. 21 ) mentions several appellations of Ganesa, viz. Vighna, Virāyaka, Sthūla, Varada, Hastimukha, Vakratunda, Ekadanta, Lambodara. But this affords no certain clue as to date. The worship of Vināyaka is found in tho Mānavagṛhya also. In the tarpeixe (II. 5. 23 ) we have the seven planets montioned in the order of the days of the week and also Rāhu and Ketu ; besidos the twelve names of Visnu occur in II. 5. 24. In II. 1. 44 Baud. speaks of tho profession of an actor or of a teacher of dramaturgy (Natyācārya) as an upapātaka. Soveral sūtras attributed to Baudhāyana on the subject of adoption in the Dattakamimāmsā and other later works are taken from the Baudhāyanagrlyasoșasūtra (11. 6), the gūtras agreeing very closely with Vasistha ( 15.1-9). 

According to Burnell the oldest commentator on the Baudhāyanaśrauta-sūtra was Bhavasvāmin, whom he placed in the 8th century. The commentary of Govindasvamin on the Dharmasūtra is a learned one and is generally to the point. He appears to be a very late writer.
