08 Hiraṇyakeśi-Dharmasūtra


8. Hiranyakeši-Dharmasūtra 

8. Hiranyakosi-dharmasūtra. The Hiraụyakeši-dharmasūtra forms the 26th and 27th praśnus of the Hiranyakeśi-kalpa. The Srauta-gütra has been published by the Anandāśrama Press (Poona ). The Hiranya koši-gļhya-sutra was edited with extracts from the cominentary of Mātrdatta by Dr. Kirsto ( Vienna, 1889). The Gșhya forms the 19th and 20th praśnas of the Kalpa, each praśna being divided into eight patalas. The Srauta-sūtra is largely based on the Srauta-sūtra of Āpastamba Tho Gșhya-sūtra is indebted to the Gļhya-sutra of Bhäradvāja. The Dharmasutra of Hiranyakośin can hardly be called an independent work. Hundrods of sūtrus are borrowed word for word from the Apas tambil Dharınasūtra. The Dharnasūtra of Hirapyakešin ia therefore the oldest voucher for the authenticity of Apastamba's text and is very valuable for checking the latter. 

The Hiranyakaśins forni a sütra-carana of the Khåndikeya section of the Taittiriyaśākhā and were formed later than the Apastambiya School. In a grant of the Kongu kings dated in 454 A. D. Brāhmaṇas of the Hiraṇyakeği School are mentioned (I. A. vol. V. page 136 ). According to the Mahārņava quoted in the commentary of the Caranavyuha, the Hiranyakeśins were to be found in the south-west between the Sahya mountain and the ocean and near Parasurama (i. e, in the Konkan). There are at present many Brāhmaṇas in the Ratnagiri District who call themselves Hiranyakeģins. The Dattaka-mlmāmgā of Nanda-pandita twice quotes passages from the commentary of Śabarasyāmin on the sūtra of Satyāsādha. If he was identical with the great commentator of the Pūrva-mimamsā (which is almost certain ), then we would have unimpeachable evidence for the existence of the works of the Hiraṇyakośins long before 200-400 A. D. 

Bühler in his second edition of the Āpastamba-dharmasutra (1893) gave (in appendix II) the various readings of the Hirapyakeģi-dharmasūtra from two MSS. I secured a modern transcript of the Hiranyakeģi-dharmasūtra from the Deccan College collection (No. 138 of 1881-82 ), which contains the text and also the commentray of Mahādeva thereon. There are 18 folios for the sūtra and 101 for the commentary. That he is presents some readings which are not noticed by Bühler as foi in the two mss. consulted by him. For examplo, the us. reads "saptama āyuşkāmamaştame brahmavarcasakāınam (revorvidtHistory of Dharmaśāstra 

the order of years in Āp. I. 1. 1. 21-22 ), omits the words "yadi gnāyāt dandavat plavet" (from Āp. I. 1. %. 30.), reads 'vastrin yeva vasitobhaya &c.' (Ap. I. 1. 3. 9 omits vasita), reads 'gurave' for 'ācāryāya' in Ap. I. 1. 3. 31. The ms. of the Hiranyakeši-dharmasūtra contains certain additions to the sūtras of Apastamba. For example, a sūtra 'kşāralavapa madhumāmsäni ca varjayet' is added after Ap. II. 9. 22. 14, a sūtra 'tesām pūjā śroyasyātmanaḥ käryä' occurs after Ap. II. 9. 25. 8, and the sūtra 'sarva-dharmāņām svadharmānusthānā. niyameşu ca yuktah syat' occurs after Āp. II. 9.25. 13. The manuscript contains a few verses, that are not found in the Apastamba-dharmasūtra, introduced by the words 'athāpyu daharanti 103, (except in one case viz. putrena, &c.). The manuscript also omits certain sūtras found in Äp. 0. 8. 

varpajyāyasām cetarair yarņaih'( Āp. II. 5. 11.8), 'anyatra rāhudarganāt' (Ap. II. 7. 17. 25), 'athopanayanam tata udakopasparśanam' (Ap. 1. 1. 1. 36.). In the case of some sütras the readings of Hiranyakeśin present a smoother and more classical Sanskrit than that of Āpastamba and are mani. festly attempts to bring them in line with the requirements of the šistas at the time when the Apastambasūtras were taken over into the Hirangakesi school. Hirapyakešisutra has 

pădonam' and 'ardhonam' for 'padunam' and 'ardhena' of A pastamba (I. 1. %. 13-14), 'asandarsane' for 'asandarse' (Ap. I. 1. 2. 29), 'aglanih' for 'aglārsnuh' (Ap. I. 1. 3. 22 ) 

praksālayet' for 'praksālayita' (Ap. 1.1.3. 36), -kartrpatyam' for kartapatyam' (Ap. I. 2. 5. 3), yathāśakti' for 'saktivisa yena' (Ap. II. 5. 12. 1). Another noticeable feature is that the arrangement of the sūtras into sub-sections is a good deal diffe rent in the two works. Bühler notes that from the 13th khandika (6th patala ) of the second praśpa both the manuscripts consulted by him do not indioate the patalas. The Deccan College manuscript does not number them from the second patala in the second praśna. The number of patalas in the first praśna of Hira yakeši is eight, 103 'पशवश्च मुखादाना अश्मा चालषणोध (वृतः । एतद् बाह्मण ते पण्यं तन्तुचारजनी

while Apastamba has eleven patalas in each of the iwo prasnas. The distribution of sūtras in the khavdikās is therefore different in the two works. Hirapyakesi has 31 khandikäs in the first prašna and 20 in the second. Besides, a few of the khandikās are diffo rently placed. The first khandikā of Hiranyakosi (first praśna ) stops after Āp. I. 1.2. 1, the third reaches up to Ap. I. 1. 4.6: Āp. I. 8. 22 and 23 ( the adhyātmāpatala ) come in Hirangakesi immodiately after Ap. I. 6. 19 and are Hirapyao I. 6. 20; Āp. ). 7.20 and 21 = Hir. I. 6. 21-22; Āp. I. 9. 24 and 25. 1-4 = Hir. 1. 6. 23; Āp. I. 9. 25. 4-13 and I. 9. 26. 1-10 = Hir. I. 7. 24 ; Āp. I. 9. 26. 11-14 and 1. 9. 27 = Hir. I. 7.25; Āp. I. 10. 28 = Hir. I 7. 26; Ap. I. 11. 31. 1-10 = Hir. 1. 8. 29; Āp. I. 11. 31. 11-23 = Hir. I. 8. 30. In the second praśna the variance in distribution of sūtras into khandikās is still greater. Besides, Ap. II. 4. 8-9 are placed in Hiranyakeši before Āp. II. 3. 6-7 and Ap. II. 6. 13-15 beforo Āp. II. 5. 10-11. Sometimes a single sutra of Apastamba is split up into two and placed in two different khandikās, o. g. Ap. I. 9. 25. 4 is split into Hir. I. 6. 23. 31 and I. 7. 24. 1 (the portion from 'rājānam gatvā' being the first sutra of Hiranya kesi, 24th Khandikā. 

The com. of Mahadeva Dikşita called Ujjvalā, is almost word iar word the samo as that of Haradatta's Ujjvala. That one has borrowed from the other admits of no doubt and Bühler thinks that Mahā deva is the borrower. But there is hardly anything to turn the scales in favour of Haradatta. Sometimes Mahädeva's commentary contains more matter than Haradatta's (e. g. on the sūtras “Saptame brahmavaroasakāmam &o', 'Upanayanam vidyārthasya śrutitaḥ', 'dvādaśāvarardhyam' and sometimes Haradatta contains more explanation (e. g. on 'tasminsoa vidyākarnāntain' &c.; on 'nāpsu slāghamānaḥ snīyāt', on 

pānisamkşubdhenodakenaika &c.'. Mahādova differs from Haradatta's explanation of the word ' atha', which the former takes in the sense of 'ānantarya or adhikara', while the latter takes it only in the sense of 'ānantarya'. That Mahadeva also is an early writer follows from the fact ( noted by Buhler p. 117 m) that portions of his commentary are contained in the Munich Ms. of Haradatta dated Vikrama-Samvat 1668 (1611-12 A.D.). It is to be noted that Haradatta after saluting Ganeša at the beginning of bis Ujjvalā does obeisance to Mahādeva ( which may medier God Siva or the author Mahādeva if he was the guru or fall of Haradatta ). Mahadeva often comments on the sutras found in Apastamba and not on the readings of them as existing

in the Hiraṇyakeši school; e. g. he comments on 'padūnam', ou *adhasanašāyi' for ardhāsanašāyi (the reading of the sūtra ), on 'ātmasvastyayanārthena' (Ap. II. 5. 11. 9 ) for svastyaya lārthena' of the ms. of Hir. The explanations of the two writers sometimes differ, as for example on ācāryādhinas syād anyatra pataniyebhyah' (Ap. I. 1. 2. 19104). One more circum stance that is worthy of note is that the Ujjvalā of Haradatta does not contain many quotations from Smộtis as compared with his commentary on the Gautamadharmasūtra. Although ono may be inclined to hold that it is Mahādova who borrows, it inust be clearly recognized that there is hardly any positivo evidence in support of such a view. There is a commentary called Vaijayanti on the Hiranyakesi-srauta-sūtra. This Malādeva is very likely identical with the Mahadeva who commented upon the dharmagūtra.
